I have been to Thailand numerous times and I'm not a big fan of BKK.   But if you insist on BKK then I would stick to the Soi Cowboy area. Nana plaza is infested with ladyboys pretty bad.   Also, you shouldn't have much trouble finding a girl friendly hotel, just read reviews.   If you have any other questions you need answered let me know."

Hookers,3e09bo,quarzi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:33:03 2015 UTC,"Hi there. Until last year in October I was a virgin too and I was a tad older than you back then.  The hooker I had sex with wasn't the one I originally would have liked to have for my ""first time"". - she was if at all ""2cnd quality"".  Long story short, I still had no problems getting a hard on and it was funny to fuck all these holes for the first time (I was astounded by practically everything and kept replying ""Oh my god"" to about every thing that happened because of this rush of sexual activity for my first time .. which made her giggle).  In the end, it was okayish. With myself vanishing from the brothel my smile faded away and I began asking myself things like : ""Wait, that wasn't so cool. I mean okay, my dick finally fucked a girl a little bit, - but why don't I feel different?! Why am I not developing any superpowers? Why doesn't my dick grow supermanly-large from this?""  Just like you in your comment above I suddenly began feeling asexual and disgusted. My first time having sex afterwards just didn't mean anything to me. I think for a large part, the fact that I didn't have the balls to go to the girl I originally wanted to go to played a large role in this.  It was until May this year that I was sure I would not go to a prostitute ever again.   ..Oh man, how wrong I was. During May I got so fucking horny that I just told myself: ""'nother round, gogogo!"".  The second time was even worse than the first time ;). The girl just didn't match her description at all - however, all the ladies afterwards were worth it big time.  Didn't mean to spam you with a textwall. Just wanted to give you a little encouragement for your future. Now, after your ""first time"", your hornyness will eventually win over you.  Wishing you a lot of fun! Greetings from BER/GER."
Hookers,3e09bo,1978_anon_guy,1 point,Wed Jul 22 10:28:16 2015 UTC,"Yup, my first time was traumatic for me. I went with someone cheap. The provider was much, much, much older than I thought. Also she had a weird abnormality around the belly button area. I was super pent up and idiot me went through with it. Soon as PIV happened, she started to buck on top of me.    Not happening. I... just... wanted... out... Told her to stop, ran into shower, got my clothes, got the fuck out of there. I felt absolutely disgusting. Got home, got into shower and curled up, crying.    Second time with a provider my age and about 5 times the money was incredible though.    She was just normal and wonderful.    She took her time, we danced, I got really comfortable with her body.    You get what you pay for.    Didn't repeat with the second one because I was afraid I was developing feelings for her. It was that good.    Your first ever provider should be about your age, height, the body type you prefer, a non-smoker if you are, expensive, not a clock watcher and good at making you feel comfortable. She should be reserved and quiet. Too much talking spoils it. She should know about having soft music on, candles, everything clean and exquisite. You should buy at least an hour of her time, take everything very slowly. There should be dancing, jokes, conversation, she and you should be at ease. You pay for the experience of being with her, the flirtation, the innuendo not so much for the sex.    That is a true courtesan."
Hookers,3e09bo,EternalSovereign,0,Tue Jul 21 04:51:55 2015 UTC,"Don't feel too bad! While I've never solicited a prozzie (honestly wouldn't know where to start safely and am saving money for a better car, so...) I have heard online that most first timers with a sex worker are usually too pent up with nerves (new person, incredibly intimate scenario but distanced professionally, social taboos) to really relax and enjoy themselves.   Take your time, try again if you feel confident, and relax.   And if you are asexual or just don't find sex appealing right now, there's nothing wrong with that. There's whole communities out there of asex people.  As for the disgusting side, eh, it's probably the same feeling with any sex with someone who has had more than one partner in a short space of time really. You can't shake off the gross sense that another dude has gone where you are going recently. I'm not sure what to recommend there, my sexual experiences have mostly been not instigated by me and usually while drunk enough to not care, which is not recommended."

Hookers,3e09bo,seeking2sugar,2,Tue Jul 21 01:28:55 2015 UTC,"Sex workers can only work with what you bring into the session. They are not therapists, or psychologists. They provide a service, getting you off in exchange for cash.  People have hitched countless layers of cultural baggage to sexuality. From morality, to romance, sex is a total minefield. Most people carry a fair amount of cultural baggage when expressing their sexuality. Many people attach ideals of status and personal wellbeing to sex, and ultimately damage themselves if they cannot meet their own expectations.  Behind all this however, is force of unmanageable power. Humans, like every other animal crave sex. This drive is so simple and resides so deep within the core of our being that we often mistake the urge for a symptom of romantic attachment, or love.  The dirty truth is that love is the symptom of your most primal desire. If you truly indulge in promiscuous NSA sex (and believe me, I have applied myself to that pursuit), you will find that your desire for companionship, love, romance subsides as your urge is satisfied. On the flipside, it is impossible to satiate your desire for sex by indulging in purely romantic pursuits. When you are on the pull, your balls turn the deepest blue possible.  If you visit a sex worker, you really have to have one thing, and one thing only on your mind. It is a beautiful arrangement. Two people, cash, sex, walk out the door. If you are free of baggage and pure in your desire to just fuck, you will often find a weird camaraderie between you and the sex worker. Many are great at their job, and appreciate somebody who knows the deal, and deeply enjoys the pleasure and aesthetics of sex. You will generally get a good hour on those terms.  To get to this level, you have to get your head in order though. You need the ability to approach a woman with confidence, and to simply communicate what you are feeling, and what you want to feel. Visiting sex workers is more like real life than you think. Confidence, and the ability to take risks brings you the rewards."

I'd cross post your question to /r/sexworkers to let more providers offer their advice--this sub is more client based. I'd also recommend you research how to be listed as a provider on P411. P411 shouldn't be your sole means of screening but it can definitely help.   Anyways, I'm a client who usually goes higher end when I'm looking for a provider. If you want to give off a higher end vibe, You'll want to consider making your own ""tasteful"" website to link to off an Eros ad. Think along the lines of sexy, yet not too revealing professional photos and a clear, well laid out design. The downside to this is that you'll have significant start up costs. If you want to be discreet, there are many escorts out there that blur their faces in photos--though I'm not entirely sure how they get their start. Again, you'll probably want to post this question to the linked sub as well"

I hadn't even touched another person except for the occasional handshake for years because of anxiety issues) and I decided to take the plunge. Repeatedly. 10 different providers later and I felt no better.  Number 11, though, has probably changed my life. There's something different about her (relative to the other 10 at least) that's hard to describe. The other providers all felt like they were all having a conversation with Hobbyist throughout their day, with Hobbyist being a generic person instead of the individuals they were, if that makes any sense. #11 wasn't like that at all and because she actually treated me like a person we were able to bond, making it possible for me to work on my issues. I stopped being uncomfortable touching and being touched, I started being able to talk with people with less difficulty, my outlook on sexuality has changed, and I just feel better in general. Seen her regularly and probably will continue until she retires.  Sorry if any of that was gibberish, I've always had trouble articulating my experiences with her and how they've helped me.  I should make it clear that this isn't exactly the norm with escorts though. As I said, I saw 10 providers before I found one who was able to help me and finding her was entirely chance."
Hookers,3dwmnz,whoamongo,4,Mon Jul 20 15:48:56 2015 UTC,"Tbh, I felt empty and disgusted the first couple times. And with my overall experience, it hasn't been a solution towards loneliness or depression. It becomes a consuming addiction where you will not find intimacy but empty sex. At times I'll find myself with a hot provider and lose interest midway simply because there is no connection. And in this underworld hobby, I find a majority of providers to be unattractive. Even from their photos. And even if they have good photos, a lot of them look trashy when you meet them in person. AMP girls can be cute but most are average. You usually settle on that she's good looking enough. Anyways, doubtful you will find intimacy and finding an eye-candy girl is more imagined than in reality."
Hookers,3dwmnz,Daty_Dato,3,Mon Jul 20 15:59:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, seeing a provider isn't a real fix for loneliness or depression. It is a sexual outlet. The hobby gave/gives me the opportunity to have sex with ladies I'd never have a chance to. It's exciting meeting new ladies and having sex with them. Without the hobby I wouldn't have ever had many experiences with many different types/looks/ethnicity. Sometimes its mind blowing, sometimes its just so-so.   If my semi racists friends actually knew who I've fucked, They'd  probably die of shock/disgust. The look on my only friend that knows when he found out was priceless.   In a lot of ways, its opened me up a bit. I'm less self conscious about myself.   I'm probably one of the rare ones that doesn't care as much about looks as many others, and most of best experiences have been with ladies that most guys would find average looking.   Guys should know, that the majority of ladies aren't models. (not the ones you can afford anyway) The ladies with 9's (TER) in looks simply aren't smoking hot. The majority of ""looks"" scores are inflated."

Hookers,3dwmnz,arbivark,3,Mon Jul 20 06:41:54 2015 UTC,"I can relate to this. Loneliness and depression and being on the autism spectrum feed on each other in a cycle. Good sex really helps.  I have had good and bad experiences with providers. Got approached by a guy in a chat room. Talked him down to $75 from 200. 1 1/2 hours of uninhibited sex, was really fun. Later stumbled into a couple of longer term things with two women who didnt charge much but would steal what they could and had substance abuse issues, it was a mess and I eventually cut them off. Had a steady thing for a couple years with a stripper where we fooled around sexually a few times and he catered to my fetish. It was the gfe kind of thing where we genuinely cared for each other, or he faked it well enough, but he eventually moved away,and the club he danced at shut down,and right now I have nothing, except i've been friend zoned by one girl, but it's turned into a great friendship, but she might be moving away.  If you can afford it, and find the right provider, and keep from getting too emotionally involved, a sex worker can be great for your mental health. It's hard to find somebody compatable."

I have mental stuff, physical stuff, stuff from injuries, a high strain porn habit. In the end you'll have to get to know the problem yourself.  It's easy to trick yourself into thinking it's all well and relaxed, only to realise after that it was stressful enough to garner some ED. Chemistry might not be right, not enough foreplay, sometimes I'm horny and head out only to lack the oomph when push comes to shove cause I just spent an hour setting up the meet.  Pills help... sort of. They're not magic, but it's noticable once you've gotten to understand the effect. Might even be some placebo in knowing you've prepared yourself, helping to relax.  I find the best reaction is to just smile, say 'oh, well, not today' and then leave. Sets you up to be relaxed and accepting for when it happens again, or not.  PSA: Don't overdose on blue pills. One is enough."

Decent to good looking. Some include everything at this price, some may not do a trip to the isles or upcharge for it. BBBJ and MSOG are very standard.  $500-600 High end of normal. Pretty much what you get for $300-500, though many of the girls with just amazing reviews (like a 9.8 average on TER) charge in this range   Above $600 the sky is the limit. There are some girls I've seen on fairly mainstream boards (like P411) advertise at $800 an hour and they must get it sometimes since they keep advertising at it.

Other posters are right that generally, the internet is the best way to go.  The only bars with good, available, hookers in my experience seem to be hotel and casino bars, not loud clubs.  To pick up a hooker, you go sit at the bar.  Women will either come up to you or make eye contact with you.  Unless you are wildly handsome or look like a famous person, that's not normal ""civilian"" female behaviour, is it?  Don't assume every friendly woman is a hooker, but be aware of the behavior.  Don't be shy and look away -- lift your glass or say ""hi"" or some other simple shit.  She might come over and make small talk, or you could initiate by asking something like ""so, what are you doing here?""  If she says ""waiting for a friend,"" (a common response from a working girl, if she's come over to you -- why would a girl waiting for a friend leave her seat to come chat with you?) jokingly say ""could I be that friend?""  Her response will help guide things from there.    If instead she says something like ""I dunno"" or ""just hangin' out"", ask if you can buy her a drink (and do so). Chill for a while, make small talk - if she's touching you or laughing at stupid jokes, ask if she'd like to go to your room.  She might say yes and save the $$$ conversation for later, or she might whisper in your ear something like ""you know, my time isn't free, right?"" -- just keep cool, say ""great"" and DO NOT TALK ABOUT SEX.  Bear in mind that hotel bars might be targets for stings, whether because the hotel has invited police to keep things ""clean"" (like at a family resort), or if the cops just have nothing better to do than impose their morals on open-minded travellers.  Either way, if she starts talking in any way about sex for money before you are in a safe place and fairly naked together, just say ""I'm sorry, there must be some misunderstanding"" or ""no, sorry, I don't think we're right for each other"" and GO AWAY.  Don't hang around, don't try to rehabilitate the conversation, just AVOID the situation.

We like to keep ourselves as far away from LE as we can, so we don't want our shit plastered all over the web, just as you don't want your shit going public.    I ask for exactly what this provider asked you for. I use it to verify who you say you are. Read this part carefully.... I do this for my safety.      This is to vet you. To make sure you're NOT LE, and that you're serious about making an appointment. Also, this is for personal safety. What happens if you give me some false info about who you are, I show up, and you kill me?   I leave your name, number, and where I'm meeting you with my safety contact, just in case something like this happens.    Once our appointment has ended, your info is destroyed. I don't keep any personal info and I don't give two shits about what I could do to you (blackmail, extortion, etc.) because I'm professional and I take my job, my safety, AND OUR privacy very seriously. That other shit doesn't enter my mind.  Do you think that we have any less to lose than you do??   Like /u/MistressByTheBay said, if you don't like it/aren't comfortable with it, you're free to find a different provider who doesn't require that stuff.  Personally, this is how I've always done it, and have not had but a handful of people not give me that info.

There are plenty of providers who work this way, so you really shouldn't be surprised or offended by such a request. Again...could I use that info in a bad way? Sure. But other than a breach of my personal safety...why would I? I don't really need anything from you and I'm not looking to ruin anyone's life OR my own. My clients trust me, and I trust them. I take the privacy of BOTH of us very seriously, and they understand that. And like /u/MistressByTheBay said.....basically, if you don't like it you're free to find someone else. No worries.

But I am not you, so what a hypothetical sex worker (who is not me) could do with your personal information doesn't really concern me.  If you want to take special caution not to reveal your real identity? See someone else, and I'll take a different client and we'll both be happy and comfortable.  Not every sex worker will be a good match for you, and not every client is a good match for me. No biggie."

Hookers,3dqgqv,Virginjohnny,3,Sat Jul 18 13:33:21 2015 UTC,"You probably will get ""hooked"" so to speak, but as long as your reasonable with the amount of money you spend, you should be ok. I think once you get it out of the way, you'll realize sex isn't some magical religious experience. It's fun, but it's not the most important part of life. It should boost your confidence since you've gotten it out of the way. Honestly if you want my advice, get w gym membership after you've done it. Look up a good weight training program and be consistent.  Nothing has done more for my self confidence then losing weight and gaining muscle. Maybe once you get in good shape you'll have the confidence to talk to a girl, or at a dating site. That way you can get a legitimate relationship that has more then just sex. Good luck."

It blew my mind how little effort it took to start getting some of the attention I sought.  And I hobbied. It was helpful; I got over hang ups I had even when I was with someone that was ready to have sex. But it was just a hobby, a way to ""fake it 'til you make it""."

It's not just how often they want to see them, but also a respect for boundaries.  In general, seeing a girl once a week is very common.  Many girls won't consider you a ""regular"" unless you see them at least two or three times a month.  So the frequency of visits you're talking about shouldn't be enough to cause her to worry.  When you're with her, let her set her boundaries and then respect them.  If there are things she doesn't want to talk about, then don't press her on it.  Keep things light and casual.

Perhaps a T-girl-seeking customer will chime in, too.  Looks good! - sends a message of quality compared to the visually clutterred ads that are full of craZzZzYy TeXt and crap.  Very tasteful pictures also exude quality and approachability - you look friendly and lovely.   Consider using a timer or having a friend take a full body picture (tastefully dressed is fine, but ""a picture is worth 1,000 words"" holds true -- a head-to-toe shot of you in a cocktail party type dress would show a trim 5'11"" stunner much more readily than just saying it with words).  Good luck and be careful out there! Speaking of which:  Your hint about ""a few more assets you'll just have to ask me about"" concerns me that you might get prospective customers speaking about sex acts over the phone or before they have gotten naked and cozied up to you -- good customers know better, and cops' cases are very compromised at that point.

As far as your disability, I would probably tell the girl ahead of time to avoid any surprises (and potentially getting your feelings hurt). For instance I'm a fat-ish guy so I always say something to the effect of ""I'm a bigger guy, is that a problem?"" 95% of the time it never is, but I'd hate to show up somewhere and then be turned down.

For me, I switch over to a blowjob when I need a break, because sex itself is a lot more work. And when it comes to anal, I consider that a whole hell of a lot more personal than blowing someone. A blowjob is sort of one sided. The guy can choose whether to really engage or not. For anal, both partners have to be invested to some extent."

What I mean is there is to be no discussion about anything of a sexual nature...until, of course, we're both getting into our thing. Usually, the way it goes down for me is like this:    You see my ad. It's simple and doesn't insinuate anything of a sexual nature but it has a couple of my pics and none of the cutesy emoji bs. It refers you to my website. On my website is my welcome page, my bio, my pics, my rates for different time blocks (1hr, 2hr, 6hr, etc.) and an explanation of simple services (brunch/dinner dates, slumber party, travel, etc. but nothing is worded to even insinuate anything of a sexual nature), and my policies for contact, deposits, refunds cancellations, blah blah blah.  You make an appointment (or not) and tell me what you have in mind (brunch/dinner date, staying in, going out for dancing, etc. - this is so I know how to dress/what to bring), and I meet you at the agreed upon location, at the agreed upon time.    I enter the restaurant/hotel room/your house/wherever and we greet each other (Hey! How are you? Good to see you.). You welcome me in, then hand me my envelope, without any kind of comment or discussion about it. I make sure the amount is correct for the allotted time.    We sit down and make a couple minutes of small talk, ending with us getting incredibly close, and suddenly we're touching. Exploring. Kissing.  It's like a date.  Once we're into it, it's too late if either of us is LE because it's entrapment at that point. So, we're clear, and the GFE fun starts.  You do your best but I'm still not satisfied, and then time is up.  Totally kidding about that last one. I am quite satisfied most every time, lol :) We get cleaned up, bid each other a lovely day, and I leave.  I have clients that simply take me to dinner because they don't feel like being alone. I have one client who sometimes takes me out for a day on his boat. I even have one client who just likes to rub my feet.    It's not always about sex, and that's not what I sell. I'm a courtesan. I'm educated in this world and I sell an experience. I don't feign interest in your words and I actually listen. I'm more about quality over quantity, so I don't see many clients. Maybe 2 or 3 a week.    Not bagging on anyone, I promise, but the clients I cater to often have more to lose than I do. Not that I cater to people who are in the spotlight or anything like that, but there is a reason they pay me a minimum of $300/hr (with the exception of brunch/dinner dates - the entire time is spent at the restaurant and only there). They understand that I take privacy/security very seriously, and they know I'm not going to be the girl that starts blowing up their phone/email/whatever for any reason.    I'm a professional and I treat this as any other job that I want to keep, and excel at."

Hookers,3dk9dl,maevtr123,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:13:56 2015 UTC,"You can get lots of STDs from any amount of time with contact of bodily fluid or skin that is infected. The chances are low through bbbj, but why risk it? Just go get tested, these clinics see people everyday who are doing the same thing as you. They won't judge you what so ever. What would be worse is if you had an STD that you ignored and either passed on to someone else, or caused long term damage. The only STD at this point that is a life ruined is HIV, and the chances of getting that through oral sex is about 1/10,000. Just go get tested and put your mind at ease."

They tend to be low cost and often allow you to drop in without making an appointment (though wait times can be long).  They do ask for you to fill out forms, but I don't believe I've ever heard of one insisting on seeing ID, so you can lie on them if you want.  Basically, they do the tests, then give you an ID code and a phone number to call a week or two later to get the results."

I'm very similar to you, 22 year old who is big and small member, never had the confidence to get a gf or bang in college.  You're in St. Louis right? If so then its probably legit because did search myself.  Those stats aren't that bad. You could tell her you're a virgin if you want, but no need to say you have a small member or a big guy (unless you REALLY WANT TO). She most likely won't care at all. You did in fact pay for her time you know. Just act confident and do what she allows you to, or you can tell her everything and she'll lead the way. However, if you do this you probably won't get to do the greek stuff unless you bring it up.  300 sounds pretty good if anal is involved (always wanted to try it myself). Just remember, use a rubber for all intercourse, and I'll leave it up to you if you want one for the oral.  Have fun my friend, don't stress too much. She seems legit."

The fact that her phone pops up nothing isn't a great sign. If I would you I would go to a site like eroticmonkey.com or theeroticreview.com and search for someone with multiple reviews and then run a reverse image search and phone number look up. Especially if this is your first time, it's better to be safe then sorry. Once you find a girl and book, never mention sexual acts, just put the money down and make sure that both of you get naked (so you know she's not a cop). Once that happens, you should be free to talk about any sexual acts without fear of her being a cop.

Hookers,3de26o,smittyjergensen,2,Wed Jul 15 18:19:42 2015 UTC,"If its a bacterial infection such as gonorrhea or chlamydia and you used a condom, it's very unlikely if not impossible for you to have caught it. Only Herpes/HPV can be caught with a condom through skin to skin contact.   However, if you went down on her, you can get a throat infection through that and if you later touch your urethra end up getting gonorrhea.   If she gave you a blowjob without a condom and she had throat bacterial infection through gonorrhea you could've gotten it, but its unlikely.   I wouldn't worry too much. Bacterial infections that cause urethritis like chlamydia also make girls have a white discharge that you'd see when having sex, and the smell is quite noticeable, not just ""fishy"", and you used a condom.  If you want to make sure you didn't get any bacterial infection take two 500mg azythromicin pills today."

That seems more awkward and rude than an ease inspiring ice breaker.  A cop will try to coerce you into saying you're paying for sex. paying for sex is illegal; paying for companionship is not. Just be polite and friendly. You can put the cash on the table when you're chatting. You don't need to acknowledge it at all. Trust me, she will know it's there and what it's for!   As for law enforcement... Do you really think a cop would go through the effort and cost of multiple ads and multiple reviews just to bust lil ol you?"
Hookers,3d8r11,thebillstone,2,Wed Jul 15 12:02:35 2015 UTC,"That's what I always thought. That you have to actually articulate explicitly that you want to buy sex.   You never know what police will do these days. I imagine they could have federal funding for human trafficking, and probably just use it for prostitution stings. I've seen Credit Card scammers with multiple reviews on TER, and they even had a website for the escort.   Usasexguide.info has been the most informative site I found. One girl with 20+ reviews on TER eventually started robbing people, and I found out on that website."
Hookers,3d8r11,maevtr123,2,Wed Jul 15 12:26:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, there is absolutely no cost to them. They could set up 50 ads in 50 cities on a daily basis and it costs them $0 they could set up a few dummy TER accounts (a drop in the bucket in terms of their budgets). It's really not far fetched... What would you rather do, be 100% sure you're not dealing with a cop, or potentially find yourself arrested. Sure if you don't talk about sexual acts or anything like that, they won't have much to book you on, but you'll still be arrested and processed. I did some research on this and it's not as far fetched as one might think (cops bend laws to get their arrests).   Now having said all of that in my (limited) experience all the girls I've been with have voluntarily gotten naked without me even saying a word. They're using the same advice I gave , as long as you and the other person are exposing your genitals, you both know there's no cop present."
Hookers,3d8r11,Pissedoffjohn,2,Wed Jul 15 12:30:58 2015 UTC,It be best not even to acknowledge the donation at all. You should be more concerned about the upsell and getting scammed.  Obvious signs would be her staying fully clothed even while you are undressing. Asking for the donation is a big no no.

Hookers,3d84pd,F00sball,2,Thu Jul 16 13:32:26 2015 UTC,I'll keep that in mind. I'm a bit scared myself since never had sex yet and was considering popping a couple viagras (doctor gave them to me surprisingly at 22). I'm afraid it will fuck up my perspective of sex without pills though. What do people think?
Hookers,3d84pd,Butnie,5,Tue Jul 14 08:28:29 2015 UTC,A couple?! Don't give yourself a heart attack. I sometimes use kamagra eg if I already had a client that day who wanted to see me cum and then have another one the same day but I only need a quarter of a pill. Gives me the full effect without the side effects.
Hookers,3d84pd,AussieMaleEscort,3,Tue Jul 14 09:19:06 2015 UTC,"Guys... it depends on the dosage of the pills he has on hand. And he's young. If you can't get it up at the age of 22, you need to be seen by a urologist. That's not normal; but more likely than not, if you cannot get it up, it's psychological at that age. Talk to your doc about this. And let him know that you solicit, because it's important for your doc to be aware; and no, they won't judge.  Source: I'm a doc."

Hookers,3d4zgt,meng88,4,Thu Jul 16 03:52:10 2015 UTC,"The topic of Kgirls seems to pop up here every couple weeks.  Someone wrote up a pretty good overview of the venue a little while ago:  https://www.reddit.com/r/Hookers/comments/3677y0/a_guide_to_the_kgirl_scene/  This site seems to aggregate a lot of the ads for kgirls:  http://www.kgirldelights.com/index.php  This type of service is also referred to as an AAMP or Asian Apartment Massage Parlor, which should not be confused with an AMP or Asian Massage Parlor.  Aside from the fact that the providers are Asian, the two are very different modes of service.  Unfortunately for newbs, AAMPs are not readily accessible for anyone new to ""hobbying"" (ie patronizing prostitutes).  They are generally careful with their screening.  And they are regional so that having references in LA won't necessarily help you in Seattle or New York and vice versa.  Each agency/booker will have different requirements for screening.  Call/text the numbers listed for girls you're interested in.  Newbs should expect to be largely ignored at first.  Calls will go to voicemail (it's pointless to leave a message) and texts will go unanswered.  It may take a bit of patience, but don't pester them.  The fastest way to get your number added to their block list is to annoy them.  Some agencies/bookers are more eager for new business than others.  If one responds, try to work with them to provide what screening info they are asking for.  If they ask for personal info, you have to decide whether you are comfortable giving them that info.  If not, ask what else they will accept.  Some may accept references from escorts.  Some may accept verification services like P411 or RS2K.  It varies by region and by agency."

In DMV area, I think it's like 260/hr GFE and 300/hr GFE+.  GFE+ mostly just means the addition of cim to the menu, sometimes it includes other items like msog or rimming.  It does NOT mean bbfs."
Hookers,3d5ubi,maevtr123,2,Mon Jul 13 19:30:28 2015 UTC,"I think three reviews is enough so long as they are all within the past year or so and the authors have all written multiple reviews. I tend to take reviews by reviewers with no history with a grain of salt.  The most important thing, though, is never, ever, ever discuss sex for money. If your date says what would you like (especially with her clothes on) think huge red flag, say ""a shoulder massage"" and leave.   Preferred411.com requires girls listed on their site to be vouched for by other known working girls or established cutomers. It's not 100% (a really determined decoy could slip through I'm sure) but it's a great place to start.   If you are really worried about law enforcement I'd suggest setting up an outcall. In an incall police can set up multiple busts in an evening, assembly line style, which makes their job easy and stats good. But few departments would bother to go to the trouble of an outcall sting for a low level misdemeanor offense.  Some people make a point to arrive early (like 30 minutes) to an incall to make sure there is no suspicious activity in the parking lot.   And lastly, in the extremely unlikely event something bad happens (and it probably won't) follow this very good advice.   Have fun and don't let too much worry ruin the experience!"

If she only does massages with happy ending, so be it, but probably more is involved at that price.  So, my step-by-step ideas:   Check her out (reviewed, etc.) - done, it seems! Make appointment for ""massage"" Arrive on time, freshly showered, with money (+ tip is a good thing to do for us larger dudes - your range seems right) that you put on a table or dresser or something, and say ""hi"" -- do not discuss sex (A) If she tells you to get ready, that means get naked -- still do not discuss sex; (B) If she gets naked or snuggles up against you, respond appropriately -- still do not discuss sex, but hey, she is naked.  If she was a cop, she's already escalated things beyond a ""massage"" so entrapment would be an easy defense; (C) Either way, no need yet to discuss sex.  This is for her as much or more than you at this point, because a male cop would be wanting to discuss sex acts for money FOR SURE at this point. She will probably take it from there, because you are naked and possibly touching.  She may just tell you to lie face down on a bed or massage table.  Do what she says. Everything should become obvious and easy - go with the flow.  If she's touching your junk and you're touching her boobies, tell her what you want to do (if needed - I think you'll find that things move along readily)   PS - How fat is fat? If regular middle-American size fat, don't worry.  If you are unusually large, you might mention it to her when you make the ""massage"" appointment.  I used to worry about my fat, but have come to realize that these providers don't really care, so long as you are very clean, polite and respectful.  It's actually made me a lot more comfortable in my skin."

Hookers,3cy9pv,Maggost,2,Tue Jul 14 21:13:07 2015 UTC,"One of the reasons I no longer hobby is due to the feelings that I had for a escort. Long story short, she was what I would consider very high end, but due to some luck I was able to get a very good deal with her. I usually am not a fan of high end girls, but instantly after our first meeting, I thought if all high end girls are like her, I am in trouble and going to go broke.  Her minimum was for 2 hours, but that usually went on for 3 or 4 (with no extra fee), I would end up taking her to very nice dinners as well with us having a date before and after. I saw her every other week, and could not wait until that time came, during the off time we would text and call each other. She knew my real name and I knew hers, things were very close and intimate and the love making was beyond awesome.  Every now and then we would meet up for coffee, drinks or dinner during her off time. She introduced me to her friends and I was even contemplating taking her to Hawaii for a vacation.   I was head over heels, so what was the problem? I am also married, I had to make a choice of either being with my wife or her, and honestly, no matter how much I loved her, I could not justify leaving my wife for a escort.   Broke it off cold turkey, not only with her but with the hobby in general. I was a mod on a board, stopped doing that as well, completely cut myself off from the hobby. Figured if I was going to destroy my marriage, I would do it a more legit way. Turns out, I was able to build the marriage back up and now I am happier.  I do still think about her and the ""what ifs..."", but I do not regret my decision. The hobby is fantasy, getting too close or peaking behind the curtain can only lead to bad things."

The jealousy we dealt with early in the relationship, but he used to bodyguard for me, years before we ever got together. He had his eyes wide open coming into this.   I don't do overly well endowed men, I have tearing issues, and nothing is worth stitches there. According to him, there's no difference. (And shit, if a 9 pound baby didn't do lasting damage, then I figure nothing will.) It's just a muscle, use it and work it out in the right way, and it's all good."

Some women aren't comfortable with that much intimacy, it's true. But many will be. And if she is reputable and kind even if it's not her thing she may know a woman she can refer you to.  Every escort I know who has been around for more than a few months has had clients who are virgins. So she will be familiar with your situation.  Good luck, and enjoy."

Hookers,3ctna6,ltjboy03,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:31:15 2015 UTC,"I go to Vegas occasionally for work (seen 3 different providers there) and I've never had a problem.  Vegas is a city where you have to be extra careful in your screening.  My criteria is number of reviews (I look for at least 20), whether they have a personal website, and if they are on P411.  The 3 women I've seen there all met that criteria and they were fantastic.  Also, keep in mind the rates.  In Vegas, legit providers simply won't be listing 200/hr.  Figure at least $400/hr for a moderately attractive woman.  Two of the women I've seen were $600 for 1 hour and $1,000 for 2.  Vegas is definitely more expensive than most cities, but really that's par for the course in that city--drinks, food, shopping, etc are all fairly expensive there.    In Vegas you should avoid BP or the casino girls no matter what.  There may be some legit providers in the casino or on BP, but your really trying your luck when using those methods.  As you experienced, most BP girls in Vegas will upsell the shit out of you.  Also, you should never go with a women who approaches you in a casino.  They may be LEO, try to upsell you, or be working with others.  I've read about men in Vegas getting robbed (and even beaten) when picking up a casino girls.  Basically, the women have accomplices who tail you and the women up to your room.  Once you get there, they rush into your room, steal your cash/valuables and leave.  They know most people won't try to contact the cops due to the nature of how they got into the situation."
Hookers,3ctna6,9012throwaway,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:52:41 2015 UTC,"Vegas is the home of the upsellers. It is so much in their DNA, they do not understand the concept of not upselling. I have had social conversations with hookers from Vegas who would brag about how much extra they would get from Johns and rag on girls who did not upsell, yet, did not understand why they never got repeat business and bad reviews when traveling.   When I did the hobby, if I saw a visitor with a 702 area code, it was a automatic skip."
Hookers,3ctna6,my_throwaway_child,0,Wed Jul 15 18:09:31 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree!  BP is the bottom of the barrel bottom feeders.  You get what you pay for.  Although you don't pay for BP, you certainly get a real shitty website and cheap girls.  If you're in texas, use www.eccienet.  They are the giants in that territory.    If you're on the west coast, use www.cityvibe.com.  They pretty much dominate all of the west coast and vegas etc.  If you're in NY, www.eros.com and www.cityvibe.com are the ones you want to go with.  I used BP twice and would never use them again.  Looks like they may be on the brink of being shut down anyways.  Although, when you're making close to 10 million a month, I'm sure you can afford the best attorneys out there."

Im definitely one of a kind and a must see I’m very personal and open, once I feel safe about where I have people and know what they desire. My escort hobby is kind of the perfect solution with getting to know a thinking mind and a warm heart, Escorting is a very special way of dating. One can be extremely direct and honest, as there are no connections to mutual past or future, and therefore no need to keep up pretense or facades. Instead one can bevery naked as a human existence in the present, and suddenly experience that we all have much more in common than what differs between us. I think it is more fun to have a real partner, since I also get a kick out of being able to give pleasure to another, and I crave to coze and cuddle once in a while."

Now that toy is giving you pleasure.   Now imagine a real woman. In this case a prostitute ( a woman you barely know ) allows you to use her mouth and vagina to masturbate with. You exchange pleasantries and money with this woman. Nothing more.   You are just using a real life person as a masturbator as opposed to a fake one.   Once you leave you return to real life. Sometimes with a fresh new perspective and maybe even more passion for your SO

Hookers,3cqflt,Butnie,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:11:09 2015 UTC,"2x means the provider will let you cum twice. Basically the same as MSOG in an hour long session.  As opposed to what many have posted, I've never had any problem with a provider from BP. That being said, you may not get what was advertised, the provider may not look as advertised, may have bad attitude, etc. Agency providers are far more likely to give a good experience.  My first experience was truly terrible. I was so scared and nervous that I could barely get it up. I had the provider come to my home, and I just felt awkward and uncomfortable the whole time."
Hookers,3cmmuj,Firsttimer10,2,Thu Jul 9 02:18:26 2015 UTC,"Do as much research and cross reference of a provider you want to see as much as possible. erotic review is top notch for such things, as well as usa sex guide, it's a free form where many discuss services and providers.   Well some providers do ask for a photo, but only as a way to verify if you are the one that is actually going to show up.   Once there, they'll do an LE check, you feel her up, and go onto business.   Do you want a sensual message and a happy ending, or do you want full service?"
Hookers,3cmmuj,Personify1138,2,Thu Jul 9 02:30:18 2015 UTC,Thank you for the reply!  Does the LE check involve me feeling her up?

Hookers,3cmmuj,Personify1138,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:40:03 2015 UTC,"No problem!  Yes, you feel her up, then she'll most likely feel you up.

Hookers,3cmmuj,inthecottonfield,3,Thu Jul 9 02:55:52 2015 UTC,"Be up front about what you want, and if she is able to provide what you're looking for. You always have the choice to go through with the appointment, I know it may seem shitty, but you deserve what you were advertised to receive.    For you next venture, when you want full service, look into spending a bit more. Find a real great provider, the experience will be much more intimate, and good connection for the two of you, you won't be rushed either. For some of the other cheaper providers if you pay an hour, you only get 30mins, if you pay 30mins you only get 15mins. Always, always try and find a good provider that has good reviews.

So when you're enjoying your 10 minute bareback blowjob just keep in mind you may end up with a reminder of that 10 minutes that will last a lifetime.   Oh, and having some of these STDs can prevent you from entering certain jobs, not to mention the very uncomfortable discussion you will need to have with your future partners to disclose your STD status, failure to disclose is a criminal offense.   All the best."
Hookers,3cetyz,-SailorMoon-,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:04:54 2015 UTC,"Show me scientific proof of someone that got HIV through oral sex. There hasn't been one.    Hep B - He must be vaccinated against it, like we all are.  99% of HPV cases in men fade away without symptoms and consequences, more than 80% of society has had it or has it. There is also a vaccine for the 4 strains that cause 80+% of cases. Gonorrhea/Chlamydia/Syphilis - They are easily curable with a round of antibiotics.  Herpes - 40% of pop. Has it, most of us don't know if we have it or not. It's not a big deal and likely won't show up ever again after first breakout. Also, it's unlikely he catches it through oral if he checks her lips and she doesnt have a breakout, although remotely possible.  HIV not a single person ever got HIV from oral, it's impossible, and the risks are mainly for her (who gives the BJ and get the semen on her mouth) rather than for him.    Having non of these diseases will prevent him from getting a job. Maybe HIV but it's impossible to get it through oral.   Stop misleading the guy and speading nonsense."

Just treat her like a human being, don't argue about wearing a condom, let her kind of guide you through the first session if you're nervous. Pay attention to her nonverbal communication. Basically like having sex with any girl for the first time.  Except you need to have the money ready upfront, in full. Don't try to negotiate the price or say you'll pay afterwards or any of that. It automatically will make her uncomfortable. If you want something specific don't be afraid to tell her nicely.

If something has been discussed prior, make sure you bring it up if it doesn't happen.  For me it was a simple kiss.  Treat her like a lady, but remember you're a customer.

I was just offering services to help improve and make your stay here more enjoyable. I understand if this seems shady because I literally thought of doing this job while I was taking a shit.

I've always thought if we focused on the therapeutic side of sex work (say, a sex surrogate helping a severely handicapped or shy man experience pleasure) it would be easier to de-criminalize.  People would realize sex work isn't all about married guys paying to cheat.   Much like medical marijuana led the way for recreational marijuana to be decriminalized.    The other way is to simply show up at the table when they are discussing ""sex trafficking"" or ""end demand"" and speak truth.  A lot of people in the anti-sex work crowd truly feel that they are ""helping"" women.  Let's show them how they're doing the opposite."

Hookers,3cbsgv,cp9406,3,Mon Jul 6 18:07:29 2015 UTC,"Read and learn. ;)  The number one rule of this hobby is to only see highly reviewed ladies. For a good time ""highly"" means highly rated. For safety's sake though ""highly"" means ""many reviews"". I assume you're in Georgia, so I'll say you'll want to use TER, maybe ECCIE and probably USASG for reviews. Maybe someone in the south Georgia area can comment on other websites.   Since she's got a pretty common name, the first thing you'll want to do is try a search on her phone number. Once I converted it to digits, I got a few hits, but no reviews. Since most review sites have phone number as a field in the review, something should have been found. Try this and see what you come up with.   Since that was fruitless, I tried what's called a reverse image search. You can do this using Google Images or Tine Eye. You can get plugins for most major browsers for both these services that allow you to right click on an image in your browser that do a search. I found three things doing this. Some of her pics are used in ads all over the country under different names and phone numbers. Some of her pics (one of the selfies specifically) are from non-hobby related site, including Twitter. The pics are not all of the same girl.   Here's my score:  She's on BP - Strike one (I have a ""no BP"" policy myself).  She has no reviews - Strike two Her pics are all stolen - Strike three  For me personally, any one of these strikes would mean she's out. With all three of them, I can NOT recommend her."

Hookers,3c1ydu,ChessBooger,8,Sat Jul 4 00:34:56 2015 UTC,"I'm a black guy who honestly can't even get his foot in the door because of the ""no AA"" thing. Any girl I find attractive has those bold words I dread at the end of their ad. It's unfortunate because I'm a pretty nice guy, and they miss out on a source of income so everyone loses. I have no doubt that I could pass for white on the phone, but that'd just be a Dick move. I just don't understand why providers don't just use basic common sense: call the guy. If he seems professional screen him, and continue like you would with any other customer."
Hookers,3c1ydu,blacock,3,Sat Jul 4 04:16:15 2015 UTC,I'm black also and it depends on the providers and economic range.  If you're hunting on backpages.. well most are like that.   If i go after top notch quality asking for $250+ an hour I almost never see that.    It's generally the $50-$120 girls on backpages  who post the no AA.

All you have to do is say ""I have no idea what you're talking about, I just needed a massage.""  You think she's going to ruin your chances with other providers?  You don't even know her reputation with them!  It's not like they're all connected through some super-secret underground fuck club: while many providers know each other via references, this doesn't mean they like each other or have more than a professional working relationship with others.  All they want to do is ensure that you're not LEO, you're not a problem client, and you're not a waste of time.  That's it.  Again, and I repeat: you are an idiot."

Hookers,3bt8ss,69bojangles69,3,Wed Jul 1 23:24:47 2015 UTC,You're not ready.  Get the help you need first.
Hookers,3bt8ss,Frozen-Chimi,-4,Thu Jul 2 06:39:34 2015 UTC,Not ready to see a hooker? Not ready for sex in general? The latter would be weird since 13 year-olds are having sex these days and I'd be less ready than them.
Hookers,3bt8ss,eightyeighther,-2,Thu Jul 2 06:45:59 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you need to have a bit more maturity about your opinions on sex and women in general. Sleeping with other men doesn't make them damaged goods the same way you sleeping with them doesn't make you damaged good. Working on this would have a big impact in your lack a sex life.   What would you consider a mature opinion? I'm very conservative. So, no creampie gangbangs etc. for me. Where do you draw the line?   You would need to provide more details on what was ""just plain weird."" You probably want an escort that provides more of a GFE than just a quickie. Many of them are used to clients looking more for companionship than sex.   I'm not looking for companionship. On the reviews I read about the ""illusion factor"" in GFE and it just sounds ridiculous. Porn sex doesn't turn me on either.  What I want is an non-judgemental environment where I can try things out and explore.  About the ""weirdness"". I didn't like her attitude, her voice didn't do anything for me, setting up a date/appointment when there obviously wasn't any attraction either on my side nor on her side. If I met her in person, it would have been/felt different.   I've never had a problem with this. Unless you're on the extreme end of either side of the spectrum this shouldn't be an issue. When you're make arrangements let them know you're very small/large and ask if you should bring your own protection. You can also just bring own if you aren't comfortable discussing it. Be sure it's not just a single condom out of the original packaging. By this I mean still in the sealed box, not just the condom wrapper. They're probably more concerned about safety than you are and a client could easily tamper with a single condom.   Cardbord boxes can be fixed, too. I have a thick cock and standard-sized condoms can't be rolled over it. I'll just mention it when setting up the appointment and hope that they won't forget about it.   On a personal note, it seems like you're putting way too much thought into this and you aren't really ready for it. Spend some time working on developing a healthy attitude towards women and sex first and you might just find that you can easily attract women when you don't see them as something of less value for sleeping with men other than yourself.   How can I develop such an attitude?  Scenario time: Next time you're at the barbers or on a bus and look around you. All those guys took their turns with the provider right before you. Would you still have a go? Do you still get turned on?  What should I do to not get turned off by this or in fact get turned on?  How would I know when I'm ready?"
Hookers,3bt8ss,eightyeighther,-1,Wed Jul 1 23:54:55 2015 UTC,"A mature opinion would be one that doesn't devalue women for having sex. Having responsible sex is a normal healthy thing that well adjusted adults do without looking down on others for doing the same. Creampies and gangbangs are not part of 99.9999% of escorts experiences so I don't understand your concern for them.   I was asking where you, having a mature opinion, draw the line?   You said you wondered about a lounge like environment where you could talk first. This would normally be under the ""companionship"" umbrella when you're paying for an escort that comes with a GFE. You're contradicting yourself or don't understand what you're looking for.   No, I'm not. Your viewpoint seems to be US centric, mine is from Germany where prostitution is legal. Here you find places like sauna clubs where men go for a wellness day, go to the sauna, eat from the buffet, swim in the pool, watch a game on TV, talk to other guys and go with a girl to a room for half-an-hour or so. Apparently the girls are pretty picky and make it clear if they want you to book them or not. You can spent time hanging out with them. And they might try to get you to book them by coming to you when you're lounging in the hot tub. And they might give you a preview/prefeel of the wares.  Here are pictures of such a place: http://samya.de/Haus/Index  ""Maedels"" is a German word for girls.   Most any escort is not going to judge you, especially for being inexperienced and trying new things so long as you follow their rules.   Yes, that's why I want to see one.   Of course they can. I'm giving you what is the most standard practice in the industry that you can follow. The only way it can be more accurate is to ask the specific escort you choose what their policy is. Whether you actually want to listen to me or not is your choice, but arguing something you have no experience in is pointless on your part.   I wasn't arguing with you, just pointing things out.   Women are people too. Start treating them like people, like you would treat one of your male friends. Start talking to new women in appropriate social situations with no intent of trying to spark a romantic interest.   How is that working out for you? I used to handle it that way too but without results. So I've changed a lot in the past years. Now, I get hit on by girls and women regularly and they give me their number. I just can't convert this attraction into a bang. As I said above, I'd like to explore first, progress into things like the progression people had when they started at an age of 15 or something, and that's not what the girls and women expect from me and I end up in the friendzone even after being in bed with them naked...   Take some counseling of some sort from a professional if you're unable to do this on your own.   I'm gonna see a professional, but not the kind you're implying.   If I was into her of course I would. Again, responsible sex is something normal healthy adults do and I don't look down on normal healthy adults.   The thing is what's ""normal"", ""healthy"", ""mature"" by who's authority? With things like fatceptance going around, I don't trust anybody to do those definitions for me.  Thanks for your input. Have a nice day."
Hookers,3bt8ss,CrankyYankeeNoSpanky,2,Thu Jul 2 00:54:08 2015 UTC,"Some might say being conservative would consist of not paying for sex or even having sex only while in a  relationship or marriage.

They are professional.  You get what you pay for, too -- I've dealt with girls who do one or two clients a day, or only a few per week -- but they often cost more per client so they can make a proper living.    1b) Another approach is to be the first of the day: girls will say what their regular availability is.  If she starts at 11:00, then pre-book to be her 11:00 appointment (even works with bordellos - get ones who are just starting their shift).  2a) expecting ""attraction"" over the phone is a bit silly.  This is a business transaction in a very competitive business where the girls might have 50 or more phone calls a day!  Just ask if they can take a visitor at X time on X day.  Don't interview them and waste their time.  2b) Sounds like a spa would be good for you.  You need to go to a high-end one if you want a quality choice and, even then, I have found quality independents or high-class agencies to be able to get closer to real 8's-10's (and, as with most things in life, you WILL pay for that privilege!).  If you don't like the idea of being number 3,4,5, whatever for the day, you can always make small talk -- has it been a long day? etc. -- but remember, they are even more concerned than you about cleanliness, because it is their livelihood!  3) bring your own fire hydrant-shaped condoms.  It's good when booking to mention that you are very wide and ask if that's OK.

In Germany, some prostitution bulletin boards have sub-fora concerning pay sex in other countries. Maybe you'll find some British forum with such a section, as lots of British are living in Spain.  Here's a German example:  http://www.freiermagazin.com/bb/forumdisplay.php?f=190  From what I gather, you'll have issues if you don't speak Spanish, as you have to call the places to get their address.

Hookers,3bl8qd,NY_Hobbyist,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:38:26 2015 UTC,"Congrats on your first experience!  Each girl has a different favorite position. Figure out what you like, and go with it during a session.   The can't stay hard/orgasm while in her is probably due to your first time nerves, both first time as a client and first time with a girl. Ask yourself this: not considering the fact that she was a provider, how attracted were you to her? How ""convinced"" were you? Sometimes there might just not be enough chemistry for it to happen."
Hookers,3bl8qd,ChessBooger,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:14:17 2015 UTC,"Good job losing your v-card. Now that you lost it, its not that special.  The v-card is all mental nothing physical. You definitely picked the right kind of girl to your first time.   The reason you couldn't cum inside of her was because you are inexperienced and you probably lost some sensitivity from masturbating. As most guys who are used to masturbating with their hand, sex is very different. Find a way to masturbate hand's free like with a doll or cushion. This will get you accustomed to the ejaculating in a that particular position.   Finally its actually a good thing that you can't cum. Most young guys would love to last longer. Hell I would love to be able to pound a chick continuously for more than 15 minutes..."
Hookers,3bl8qd,analfuck,0,Fri Jul 3 00:19:39 2015 UTC,Don't worry about taking it from a whore. You pay them to learn and experience what you would not otherwise. Don't worry about them so much when you are with them they know what they are doing. Just do what you want. But remember that when you are with a non working whore you want them to experience it more so focus on them. In reality the girl you paid just wants you to get off here and leave.
Hookers,3bl8qd,thebillstone,-2,Tue Jun 30 14:11:14 2015 UTC,"Yikes, you ate her out? It's something I'd really like to do, but a lot of escorts I've come across have had some unpleasant smells down there.   Condoms suck. I even have Crown condoms which are supposed to provide the most sensation, and still can't orgasm from sex. I used them with tight sex toys to determine how much sensation is lost using a condom, and I would say 30 to 40% loss in sensation using a condom. You really have to be ultra sensitive (in the premature ejaculation sense) to orgasm using a condom, so no masturbation or watching porn for a few days leading up to the sex. Porn will desensitize you, and orgasming is a lot about your mind and how turned on you are.   With missionary you can control the sex more, and push in certain angles and at certain speeds to feel the most sensation. If she is on top, she has to kind of guess on what speeds and angles to use.   Of course, bareback sex is like playing Russian Roulette. If there were a vaccine for HIV, I would be all for it. It's bad enough contracting something like syphilis and scabies from a bbbj and cfs. lol"

Hookers,3bl8qd,NY_Hobbyist,2,Tue Jun 30 14:26:06 2015 UTC,"If the providers you see had some unpleasant smells down there, then you should probably start seeing some higher class providers...    Yes, condoms suck. STDs suck more. And no, you don't have to be a premature ejaculator to orgasm with a condom. You just have to not be a chronic masturbator who has lost all feeling in their dick."
Hookers,3bn0t6,HamBone84,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:11:30 2015 UTC,"I think by the nature of this line of work most providers stay in it for a while then move on.  Those who stay on for 10 or 15 years are more are the very few.  From reading blogs of sex workers and stuff it does appear that many ""retire"" and later return to work if they needs funds or the circumstances are right.    Although it is not unheard of for a provider to give her personal contact information to a preferred client, it sounds like that didn't happen in your case, and she mostly likely has put her working days behind her.  Just move on, there's lots more providers out there."

Hookers,3bk5xl,I_LOVE_HOOKERS,3,Tue Jun 30 07:30:20 2015 UTC,"Funny story. Wife and I had a regular girl. We moved out of state, and a few years later, I was visiting in state, and gave the woman a call. Rates had dropped, but she insisted on our years old rate, which was above her advertised rate. I declined and she promptly offered the advertised rate. Red Flag #1. Since my wife wasn't with me, and we'd seen her too many times to count, I agreed to my first, and only, incall ever. I showed up, paid her, and she had no condoms. Huh? Red Flag #2. She suggests we drive a few blocks to convenient store to pick some up. I'm bewildered, but agree, and I walk out of her door, with her closely behind me. Door closes and I hear the click of the deadbolt, with her on the inside. Like a dumbass, I knock on the door. Of course, no answer. I send her a text about how stupid it was to be throwing away a lot of money on return visits. No reply.   A few weeks later, wife joins me in the state. She wants to see our old provider. lol. She has no idea of my experience, because I was humiliated. I tell her we should try a different one. Wife wasn't having that. So, I text the provider, and basically lay out that wife is in town, she wants to see her, multiple hours, etc. Lo and behold, I get a reply, with an apology. I tell the provider I'll only do this if I don't have to pay her until we're all done, and of course I'm shorting her what she stole. She agrees. Wife was absolutely oblivious, so talk about some very awkward sex between the 3 of us. lol. Wife could feel it, and after said we'll never use her again. Wife coughed it up to the time apart.   About a week later, the provider texts me asking if we're interested in meeting again. I was stunned. So here's what I did. I told her we were actually in a hotel in a town that was about 100 miles away. Provider still agreed for an extra $50. Now, to get to the town we were in, you had to travel on a toll road. $5 one way. The providers car was a shit bucket, getting maybe 12 mpg. Do the math. So told her to head our way, and text when she was in the parking lot of the hotel I gave her. About 2 hours later, my phone is blowing up because she's arrived, etc. I shut my phone off and went to bed. Wife and I weren't even in the state anymore. The next morning when I turned my phone on I was bombarded with dozens of text, that were progressively more hostile, and about 6 threatening voicemails. I texted her back and said she shouldn't have tried to rip me off, and sorry for her inconvenience. By my calculations, she was out about $75 for gas and toll, and hours of her night. I was satisfied."
Hookers,3bk5xl,MMABouncer,3,Tue Jun 30 20:18:36 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure you pay her before.

Hookers,3bk5xl,-pornviewingaccount-,3,Mon Jun 29 22:27:17 2015 UTC,"A good provider will expect to be paid up front, and won't count it in front of you or until after you leave. That's what one part of the screening job is about. To screen the ones who would short change out."
Hookers,3bk5xl,Frozen-Chimi,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:15:10 2015 UTC,"I always pay before, even with my regulars.  I always get a gift card, wrote a short note, and place the donation in there.  First time or fiftieth time with the lady, I lay the card in a very conspicuous place.  I have never had a lady open the envelope before we played.  Even the ladies I am seeing for the first time wait until after I leave to open it.  But the fact that they know it is there makes everybody comfortable."
Hookers,3bk5xl,justanotherhobbyist,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:18:19 2015 UTC,"It all depends on the provider, but always have it ready and visible before as good manners if nothing else. Most higher class providers won't immediately go for it or even acknowledge it once they see it, and will only take it at the end of the session. Personally I leave it in an envelope on a nightstand or wherever.   The ""legal reasoning"" is that it's only illegal to explicitly sell sex acts for money. Most believe that as long as you never mention both together, you're safe. That's why a lot of providers will refuse to discuss acts beforehand, and refuse to talk about compensation. Therefore if you just happen to have some cash in an envelope lying around, and don't directly hand it to her, you're not ""paying"" her, so it's not prostitution. In actuality, if it's really a police sting, it's going to be a thin defense at best. Still, a lot better than going ""here's 400 bucks to have sex with me""."

I have no clients that I do bareback with, and my husband has had a vasectomy, so technically, there is no reason for me to be on birth control. But I still am, because condoms break, and worst case scenario, I end up over my head in a bad situation, I'd rather not have to worry if I just got pregnant from an assault. Even though there is very low risk of my becoming pregnant, it's extra security. But, it's in no way a sign that she does bareback."

It's a guy who may threaten violence if you decide not to go through with the session, or if you try not to pay full price because her performance was underwhelming, or who may try to barge in if it's 30 seconds after the allotted time and she hasn't walked out yet.  I'm sure that you personally are still giving your best performance even with a driver backing you up, but a lot of girls who are really terrible at this, have bad attitudes or are using fake pics or something want a driver/pimp as a shield behind which they can give poor performance and still get their full payment through threat of violence. Or just straight up cash-and-dash."

Hookers,3bctnr,Only_Sometimes_,7,Sun Jun 28 00:24:21 2015 UTC,"The laws in Vegas as they pertain to prostitution are the same as they are in any other major city in the US.  That is, it's very much illegal.  The only places where prostitution is legal are in the licensed brothels located in some of the less populated counties in Nevada.  I believe the closest such brothels to Vegas are in Pahrump, which is about an hour's drive out of the city.  These brothels all have websites and phone numbers.  You can call them and they will answer any question openly since they are operating legally.  I think this option may be your surest best in terms of getting what you want without being ripped off or horribly disappointed.  Vegas, despite its reputation as ""sin city,"" is actually not a great city for the casual tourist seeking a prostitute.  If you're a local or if you're plugged into the scene, then you know where to go and which agencies or girls are legit.  But, because there are so may tourists in town, a lot of agencies and girls will try to scam them with bait and switches, upsells, or outright robberies.  If you decide to try and find an escort in Vegas, I suggest doing your homework and prebooking someone before you get into town."

Hookers,3bctnr,unhealthyadvice,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:06:57 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of great escorts in those cities and you'll find their ads on Cityvibe, Eros and Backpage for the most part.  Many will want references that come from other escorts you've seen, real ID cards, or employment information.  For the latter two, there are independent 3rd party services like P411 (Preferred 411) that some girls will accept.  The best site to research reviews for escorts in those cities is probably TER (The Erotic Review).  Another option you might want to look into for LA and SF is to check out the swingers clubs.  These are basically parties where couples or single women can get in for a fairly reasonable fee.  The range of activities there ranges from vanilla to kinky, and you are free to just watch or participate.  The whole environment is very safe and all about pleasure.  It shouldn't take much more than a google search to learn more if you're interested."

One post a week, that explains HOW the verification took place, including any verification of the client.  And ideally with follow-up on how it went - not explicit talk, but confirming that she was legit or not.  I'm tired of these ""is she legit"" posts too.  But I try to be patient.  Reddit is often the first place where inexperienced guys come to to learn about these things.  As long as there's no legal pathway to buy sex in the USA, we've got to understand that some people will come here for information.  We won't give them SPECIFIC information, but we can teach the how to find what they're looking for safely and without hassle."

I have a great deal of sympathy for those wanting verification to avoid legal hassles, but for the rest, people have to do the legwork.  Like most clients, I have had my share of dud sessions with scammers and time wasters, but that is part of the game. If you want easy anonymous sex, the conditions to facilitate that also enable scammers.  You need experience, and you need to get hurt in the wallet a little in order to harden yourself against shitty providers. If you rely on others, and you never learn to walk away, you will eventually get burnt, big time."

However, I think they should be allowed, maybe on like 2 days out of the week (say Saturdays and Wednesdays) and maybe have some strict guidelines to make them more meaningful.  For instance, there could maybe be a requirement that the poster called the providers number and provides details of exactly what happened before posting, as well as also being sure that pictures and appropriate links are provided as well.   Maybe an informational post telling all users to be sure to use a burner phone, and requiring that they at least initiate contact would raise the quality of posts about such a thing.  I don't know what the solution is, I myself haven't posted such a topic but I honestly know that I could benefit greatly from those who are more experienced than me so I would like to still have that resource/option available.  I've already received a fuckton of useful information from different users here, and it really can help out.

I understand it happens much more in areas where there are a lot of low income and high income people coming into contact with each other (such as third world tourist destinations) as well as areas around large numbers of unattached males, such as military bases.   Thailand has or had most of those, and prostitution took off there.   I suspect that a lot of sex-for-money is very situational.  Given the right circumstances, most all guys at some point in their lives would pay for sex if the opportunity was in front of them, and most women at some point in their lives would be open to accepting money for sex."

Of course, smoking is in decline, but it is a good visual display of how prevalent involvement in the 'hidden' sex industry is. Next time you are at a bar or party, make note of the proportion of people going out for a cigarette break.  I don't know what the ratio of sex workers to clients is though. I assume that there are more clients than sex workers. Clients tend to have much longer 'careers' than sex workers too, with the majority of sex workers dropping out fairly quickly.

Many guys don't like giving it.   She'll know who you are, probably where you work and where you live. 99.9% of the time it won't be an issue, especially with ladies that have many reviews. 15 is probably enough where I wouldn't be nervous about providing it, but I probably wouldn't give it. I've given it to a two ladies but both of them had pages upon pages of reviews. 100's of reviews. Well know ladies. No issues so far.   I avoid it now, because I have so many references and Okays(p411) that I don't need to. If I see a lady that requires it and won't accept the references I can provide, I just don't see her. So many ladies to choose from, there is no reason to give it out. The vast majority of ""higher"" end ladies accept P411 in my area. Soon I'll probably start deleting Okays as they get old."

You can stay at the Hotel Del Rey, in San Jose for about $70 a night. The lobby of the Del Rey is also a brothel with dozens of young, beautiful women. Sex is about $50 an hour. Double that if she has a friend. You get to hang out and dance/drink with the women all day long too."

Hookers,3aukfv,MMABouncer,2,Tue Jun 23 20:19:11 2015 UTC,"Costa Rica is very safe. Hotel Del Rey is very safe. As far as eating goes, there is a fine restaurant directly across the street that is owned by the hotel, Blue Marlin, as well as a night club to meet/dance/drink with the working girls in the evening time. The hotel restaurant is American priced food. It's quality, just priced for tourists. The drinks are all American priced as well. However, across the street is a fast food burger joint, for budget eating. Also, Del Rey is only a few short blocks from a shopping central square that is absolutely packed during the day. Think Times Square, NY. In there, you'll find McDonalds and a whole assortment of bakeries, convenience stores, etc. You can buy beer/liquor at these stores and bring them to your room, in a backpack. All of this is very safe, during the day.  As far as the culture, the girls speak very little English, but they know the basics of negotiating for price. Working out details will be difficult, if you have certain fetishes, but some of the girls speak ok English. There are no pimps, but directly outside the entrance to the Hotel are drug dealers. I've never dealt with them, so can't offer any advice. They aren't aggressive and remember that drugs are illegal. It's worth noting that the hotel also ID's every woman in the lobby to verify that they're over 18. And the hotel charges $15 per girl to go to your room. Be aware of that. If you go shopping for goods, shoes etc, be aware of gringo pricing. It's a horrible aspect of their culture, but they will jack the price up on you, just for being foreign. Good rule of thumb. If it's not tagged with a price, don't buy it. The price they quote will be high. Taxi service from the airport to the hotel is about $20. Same going back. If you're only in it for the sex, then Del Rey is a one stop shop and I won't get into details about exploring Costa Rica. Sorry this is a rambling response, with no grammatical structure, but I'm writing as I'm thinking and not caring. If you have any questions, feel free to PM me. My wife and I have done the Del Rey sexcapade many times.   Edit: Lobby also has a small casino. Not my thing, but it's there."

Hookers,3aukfv,MMABouncer,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:19:26 2015 UTC,"Don't hesitate to PM me for any other details. Like I stated, we've been to Costa Rica many times, and have thoroughly explored the country. There are other towns with thriving sex businesses, but Del Rey is only a cab ride from the Airport. And wife just pointed out, there is another brothel/hotel in San Jose called The Sportsman's Lodge. We've never been there, but a lot of the men jump between these two hotels. We've always loved the inner city, and the architecture of the Del Rey, plus the nightclub, so we've never seen a reason to check it out. Guess it's worth noting: If you want to add to your travel time, you can rent a car, take a bus, or a very expensive cab ride to Jaco Beach. There is a hotel directly on the Pacific beach that is a brothel as well. We've been there, but Jaco wasn't our cup of tea. It's about a 3 hour drive from San Jose. I'd recommend Del Rey just to get your feet wet. The women are stunning. A few of them even run in teams. Also. Let them know that if you're happy, you'll tip them more after your time. It keeps them open minded. And if things go well, throw them an extra $20 or $40. This brings the price up to about $100 for a girl, but word will get around, especially if you're staying for a week, and you'll get a lot of enthusiastic smiles. My wife and I tipped a woman extra after our time, and she remembered us a year later when we showed back up. Got drunk with us, and showed us another good time. If the service isn't good, though, don't be obligated. And if you're comfortable, talk to the other men in the bar. Some are pretty friendly, and can offer pointers on all facets."

I've also just never been out of the country before, and I'd like the chance to just see somewhere completely different where my money would go a long way. I'm still looking into it, but right now Venezuela sounds pretty good.  I'm also looking locally a lot more on the advice of another redditor who schooled me on a bunch of stuff, so while the sextrip aspect of it is still an allure I'd like to actually do a bunch of fun out of country stuff while I'm out and about as well."

Hookers,3aukfv,MrLutareio,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:25:51 2015 UTC,"One of the things he said that convinced me was breaking it down somewhat price-wise and risk-wise. I am not very experienced, so the research I had done up until this point was more from free sources instead of the more in-depth, exclusive, paid sources out there. From what I've learned these sources offer a lot more safety and overall better quality of selection.  Also, looking at the total cost considering airfare needs to be taken into account. I just did a cursory search for a ticket to Venezuela scheduled 6 months out in January, and the price is just under $1,000 round trip. Which still leaves me with $2,000 afterwards, and from what I'm learning that can be stretched a pretty long way.  However, looking at it just from the monetary side of things, it looks like you can pick up a decent, reviewed chick for $250-$300 (sometimes a little less, sometimes a little more), so over the course of 7 days could theoretically get it in quite a bit for just $2,000.  Also, just finding out that I could probably get an awesome value for my money overseas by converting the currency makes me want to make sure that when I do go I'm going to get all my money's worth--especially with regards to airfare (which is the single largest expense). With that in mind, I'd probably like to double my time over there. The way my job works is that I accrue vacation hours very quickly, but all vacation hours past a certain number all get converted into (basically worthless) sick time at the end of the year. So, for me the best time to be able to go if I'm going to take off around 80 hours is before the new year, however I don't know how reasonable this would be because I'd probably need to aim for early November before people start taking off for the holidays. It could still work out, I'm making a goal of trying to pick up some extra time every month until then and squirrel the money away.   Know that this was a rambling response but I'm still working things out from practical standpoints. Basically the shorter my ""sex trip"" the better value I get from staying local, as well as not having to worry about some potential overseas cultural problems. But I actually want the experience of getting out of the US for a decent amount of time as well, so there's that too, and I'd rather do it sooner than later. Looking at the chicks advertised on some overseas websites...good god they are attractive lol.  I'm probably going to start local though, just so that I'm not going for the gusto while I'm completely green at it if nothing else."

You could try Mexico from the southern parts too - just be more careful there.  Beyond that, where do you want to go?  It's not like there is only one sexual paradise in the world.  There's lots of places.  But don't go somewhere only to have sex.  You've got to take into account the local culture and language and what you can do there.  For example, some people the the Asian countries ... others get annoyed when they encounter language barriers or misunderstandings.  Other than sex, what turns you on?  Beaches, mountains, adventure sports, temples, what?   There's always Australia and New Zealand ... legal sex work in exotic, faraway locations that still speak English.

Hookers,3arh9b,sum_cp,4,Mon Jun 22 22:31:44 2015 UTC,Depending on location and timing I'd imagine a CBJ would run about 50-100. Not likely to get/want a BBBJ.  You could try negotiating..
Hookers,3arh9b,Daty_Dato,2,Tue Jun 23 01:07:16 2015 UTC,"Its hard to give a definitely answer to this. Too many unknown variables. City, looks, cbj or bbbj, season,   A big city like NY or Boston would cost more. Most the time junkies give bjs with out condoms. Junkie girls usually have a cycle. Depending on which stage she is in or how desperate she is. If she just started doing crack recently and still fresh it cost more.  In NYC ranges from $20 -80. Ugly ones are usually 20 while better ones are like 40."
Hookers,3arh9b,ChessBooger,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:29:44 2015 UTC,"I am in a big city on the west coast so it's probably safe to assume that's similar. No condom is too risky for my liking, even though I'm not sure how high the chances of catching anything would actually be. Never worn a rubber for a BJ before, but I've also never gotten one from a street hoo'er."
Hookers,3arh9b,ChessBooger,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:58:41 2015 UTC,I'm no medical or std expert but receivers of BJ's have relatively low probability of catching anything. However that's not to say you can't. You're probably looking at herpes or gonorrhea rather than HIV but again its not 0%.  I'm curious why you are asking specific for street hookers? They are the bottom when it comes to sex workers. If you live in a big city there are more options well worth your money. Being on the street means its also riskier to getting busted by Law enforcement. The only good thing about street hookers is that they can probably suck better than most of the other working girls lol.

Hookers,3agrvy,jmsnides,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:18:04 2015 UTC,"I dont know man. Backpage girls from my limited but few experiences is that they are wrecks. Young, averagely cute, poor, and generally self destructive. These girls aren't making $1000 in a day and living in a gym and retreating to their mansion in the hills. But then again, I've never been with a $500+/hr girl.   But as for the MP, usually they front as a business pretty well and keep the place clean. From my experiences. The only one that I went to that was sketchy was in a bad part of garden grove and I went in at close to 12am- or 1am. I forget, it was a long time ago. I pulled into the parking lot seconds before these two black guys and they let me in. Then they told the two black guys they were just closing. lol, I over heard it and was worried for a minute they might get pissed and vandalize my car. They didn't.  But the thing that always stuck out in my mind was in the main walk in area there was an old, fat, balding man in a wife beater, shorts and sandals passed out on the couch with the tv on, and most of the lights were either off or very dim.   Now that I think about it, that place felt like a scene straight out of taken. So I would suggest just staying out of MP's in run down neighborhoods and if it ain't clean, just leave. Would you eat at a restaurant if you saw them storing clean plates on the floor? hell nah."

Hookers,3af4xg,SpaceRub,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:27:08 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly new to this. I've gone to 5 different girls overall. 3 were backpage escorts(all fairly bad experiences) and 2 Asian Massage Parlors.   The best Escort experience was a girl working out of her home. But she was freaked out the whole time thinking I might be LE. She had said her sister was recently locked up for hooking. :facepalm:  The other two escorts operated out of hotels. And one felt gross, and the other was utterly disgusting. I'm talking about trash all over the floor, the room smelled like ass, cigarette ash all over the floors, night stands, bed/pillows and clothes drawers. She had said, she was trying to clean up a little before I got there, but yeah fucking right. It was really gross and she was rushing me and it sucked. $100 down the tubes...  Now my first AMP experience I went in and laid down. I saw the place on backpages hence the reason I choose it. She was asking me questions about myself and where I found this massage place. I said BP and she giggled, said thats what everyone says. I thought I was in, I was like, this is it!.   But because I was shy and didn't make a move, our time flew by and my massage was over. As I sit there with a towel over my lap and my time up, I asked if there was any extras and she smiled and shook her head no.  I smile back at her and say no problem. I get dressed and give her a small tip for the massage. I never went back.   Now fast forward to today and I went to my second AMP. This lady came his stroking my back and legs and lifting the towel exposing my butt. It felt pretty obvious what kind of massage she was giving out. She complimented me a lot and I turned around and said lets start on the front, and grabbed her thigh a little bit. She seemed very receptive so I gave her boob a little squeeze and she called me a trouble maker while giggling. It was definitely going to happen this time.   She started whispering to me to keep this a secret and asked something about the price. I just held up my hands with 6 fingers meaning I have $60. She liked that and went and got the lube and started slathering the Pillar and stones.  Dude, I'm telling you, a great hand job is better than sex or oral. Sex and Oral have their place, but the manipulation of 10 super slippery fingers on two hands feels amazing. After we finished up, she told me to come back and see her again and next time will be better. :D She gave me her card and the days she works and I left so much happier and satisfied than any of the escort experiences.   So in my opinion, go to an AMP. As she starts to massage you, you have to let her know you are not a cop and you either have to squeeze her thigh, butt, waist or even boob.  This happens to them probably sooooo often, even if they are not into that kind of service, they will let you know very very gently and discreetly. It wont be embarrassing at all. The biggest factor is getting out of your head and just doing it.   After today, i swear I will only go to AMPs. Just felt safer, cleaner, less sketchy and it seemed like the girl didnt mind being there vs the escort who was the complete opposite.   Hope this helps and be safe out there!! Seriously!   oh and to answer your actual question: Rubmaps.com and backpage.com"
Hookers,3af4xg,SpaceRub,2,Sat Jun 20 02:50:44 2015 UTC,"As she starts to massage you, you have to let her know you are not a cop and you either have to squeeze her thigh, butt, waist or even boob.   So this is done when she starts... just to communicate with her that you're legit. Do you just reach out? Or do you wait for an opportunity like her getting close enough? Politely or how so? Does she just move in close that way to give you that opportunity? I'm not sure what the protocol is here..."
Hookers,3af4xg,SpaceRub,3,Sat Jun 20 05:52:44 2015 UTC,"you know what else I did that I forgot to mention? When I was getting undressed I left my wallet out on the table with a couple $20 Bills fanning out a little bit. Its out in the open, but she wouldn't be able to out right take it. Just like this:  http://thumb7.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/1189331/235694605/stock-photo-one-dollar-bill-wallet-isolated-on-white-background-235694605.jpg  So when she walked in, She could see it pretty quickly and knew a nice tip could be earned. So I'm guessing that made her extra friendly and allowed me to free roam with my hand just a little bit.  Like I said, when I grabbed her boob she called me a trouble maker in a flirtatious way. But the party started when i placed her hand on my genitals.   Another thing to think about, when she first starts, be friendly and nice. Ask her questions about herself. I found out my lady was a chinese woman who has been here for about 4 years and lives about 30 miles away. They are people and not just objects to be used. :)   After the massage is done, they will often ask if you want a water. When she leaves, get up and set the money in a spot that makes her realize this is now hers. After she gave me the water I simply pointed to it without saying anything. The key to everything is Signals without saying anything. Money on table, light touching of her, placing her hand where you want it and indicating how much money you have for her."

Hookers,3af4xg,ltjboy03,3,Sat Jun 20 08:07:40 2015 UTC,No.  I am saying that LE cannot eliminate a pool of people as this could be considered entrapment.  Therefore anyone who has restrictions on certain people then they cannot be LE.
Hookers,3af4xg,Straight_Jackin_it,3,Sat Jun 20 01:30:04 2015 UTC,"makes sense. Especially when LE would love to lock up A.A.'s   For me, If a girl offers both incall and outcall, that to me says she is legit. Because I just don't see LE sending a woman to a house/apartment. And as long as the convo prior had nothing sexual in context... then what can they do.   Another thing to note, if you text them and are having difficulty communicating with them. Maybe you ask for their address and they dont respond for 10 minutes or ignore certain questions all together and you end up finding them annoying as fuck before meeting them, they are probably legit. The girls I hooked up with from backpages were wrecks.  LE will probably be more prompt and ready to conduct business. Just my opinion. #shruggie  I prefer AMP's. You walk in pretending to get a massage, and then you and the masseuse make a secret deal kept even from the establishment. You put your finger over your mouth with a ""shhh"" motion and place their hand on your junk. If they are receptive, awesome. If not, apologize and at least you got a decent massage.   AMP's all the way. They are 1000% cleaner and the girls don't seem to mind earning a $40-$60 tip for a 10 minute hand job plus massage."

Trust me, most 18 year old girls have no qualms and even prefer hooking up with guys many years older. I'm talking late 20's even into the 30's. A 2 year difference is nothing.   Either way, younger, older, or same age, they're not looking to date you. You're a customer. Not to sound cold, but do you think the cashier at wal-Mart cares how old you are?"

I'd add that most escorts will be fine with you taking a shower at the end of the appointment, even if the hour is already up. Might be an idea if you're worried about your girlfriend noticing any smells on you. Also, unless you're into drugs yourself, avoid any escort who uses the word ""party"" or similar on her ad. It's a common escort euphemism for taking drugs. Usually coke and or crystal. If she's high or can't wait to get rid of you so she can go spend your money on more drugs, it's not going to enhance the experience for you."

You can try and get the same girl again and pay $100 for FS, though if she remembers you she may be taken aback since you gave her $120 for just an HJ the last time.

Regardless, if a lass ever complains about the tip, or is aggressively up-selling, I'd put that one on the do not visit list.  The other prices are relfective of a sub-urban AMP as well.  Now a true AMP will have the girls dressed in lingerie, stripper style, and the table shower will be standard.  There the prices are:    $120+House Fee for a half hour - usually $160, or $140+House Fee, usually $200, for a full hour.   At a good AMP, the price difference is for the additional pampering that replaces any pre-text of a massage most of the time."

I'm looking for a dominatrix, not a submissive woman. There may be some light bondage involved - I'll be bound, and she'll make me worship her feet I guess. I'm perfectly fine with sex not being offered, it's just a fantasy I had for a while that I want to experience, at the hand of a pro.

I've been with some providers who don't even make eye contact, with an SB I can take her out for dinner, all night and treat her just as equal I would with a girlfriend."
Hookers,3a2fgg,gothbull,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:48:59 2015 UTC,"When I checked out the sugar scene, I went as far as signing up and actually meeting a few ladies, I discovered that the real benefit was the addition time you might get for your date. Instead of 300 an hour you might get 2 or 3 hours for that.   The negatives, for me, is the same thing. I don't need the time, and don't want any type of relationship that needs to be nurtured. If you can utilize the time, including overnights for super great rates its a better deal. For those of us that can't sticking the the pro's is better. There is not attachment, very few emails to answer. No talking on the phone.   The rates vary quite a bit. I was offered by a few (not the best looking ladies) that if I got the room we'd hook up. One was asking for 100.00. Had one pretending to be a pro looking for 600 a date.  Most where right around 300 a date. Some asked for a lot more."

There's this misconception that we're part time girlfriends or on call hookers. There's plenty of sugar babes who have physical limits. Speaking for myself, I only use condoms (BJs too)and will not do an overnight and I'm about $700 a date which doesn't include what you cover in my commute, dinner, hotels,gifts  or other dates you plan and I'm no model.   While there are SBs who'll take cash for sex, many want gifts and dates etc.   Also, while escorts will decline clients, you'll find SBs look for longer term things so they'll have more standards as in wanting to have attraction (using myself for example, I won't see you if you're fat or over 50) or chemistry.   Not saying it's impossible but if you're looking for variety and don't have the extra time or cash for gifts, dates, and trips, and some courtship  then escorts are the way to go."

Granted there will be girls in desperate situations who probably have less restrictions.   But if you or anyone else is considering sugar babies, It's not just sex. It's also companionship and a different lifestyle.   If you're looking for more bang for your buck, then it may not be for you. I'd only recommend it for people who have a lot of disposable income who aren't bargain hunters.   Again, not a model, but you can easily spend 1k one night on dinner, wine, and my ""allowance"" whereas you can skip all that and jump to sex for a fraction of that with backpage girls."

A person newly infected with HIV may not test positive for up to two months after infection, yet still be contagious. However, that really depends on the test, the porn industry uses one that can detect it within three weeks I think. Herpes and HPV are not tested for usually.   It's a gamble and trust game. It frightens me to be with a provider who tells me it's 50 dollars extra for bareback."

Yet I think the guys who do it have some type of ""spoiling her"" fetish; perhaps makes them feel like a independent provider (and protector) which is a positive masculine attribute in our culture.   Being rich is usually enough to procure an attractive girlfriend, but I imagine some men might be reclusive or busy or just enjoy spoiling women. Reminds me of human history when polygyny was the norm, and a few wealthy men monoplized all the women in harems."

Women are not whores and they are no different than their counterparts. I am not trying to ""fuck a bitch"" nor am I trying make notches on my bedpost.

If you put your real picture and your real deal up on the internet then there are always people that will want you. It may not be the same people she wants but there will be people who will. She is false and she gets what she gets with the walk out. Me I always let them suck me off even if it is not the legit girl in the photos.
Hookers,39vjm0,analfuck,3,Mon Jun 15 14:01:41 2015 UTC,"This one was FAR worse than a B&S. She was completely and utterly unfuckable.

Hookers,39vjm0,Daty_Dato,1 point,Mon Jun 15 08:39:52 2015 UTC,You may be able to write a review because you did meet face to face. Chalk it up to the lack of reviews... I always look for reviews from guys with lots of reviews. It isn't completely fool proof but I've never had a bad date. Had some average ones where experienced hobbyists said they lady was fantastic. Wanted to punch them in the nuts... 10 on looks and the lady is like a 5/6 WTF..
Hookers,39vjm0,thebillstone,0,Mon Jun 15 23:52:47 2015 UTC,Bait and switch. It will happen in the non-hooker world too; i.e. dating sites. You should leave a bad review on this one unless you want others to meet the same peril for the lulz.

Hookers,39uqz6,AufLiederhosen,5,Sun Jun 14 23:21:39 2015 UTC,"Seeing a provider for sex is fine (and pretty much the point). Seeing a provider for intimacy is a fool's errand, and pretty much not the point."
Hookers,39uqz6,harfleur,3,Mon Jun 15 05:07:29 2015 UTC,"As long as people are safe, and it's consensual I don't care what kind or how much sex my partner has had before our relationship. I have no rights or ownership to their past. I do t even ask those kinds of questions, the details of their sexual past is none of my business unless it pertains to their sexual health. Anything my partner would chose to share with me I would receive with respect and understanding. But I am an extremely sexual,y progressive female. I have very liberal ideas when it comes to sexuality."
Hookers,39uqz6,Delicatefukinflower,3,Mon Jun 15 00:39:23 2015 UTC,"The vast majority of guys that hobby already have/had the relationship you seek and don't find it fulfilling or don't want to try again. 95% of hobbyists are over 40.  Never bring it up. Why would you?  You can just say it was a hookup and leave the cash payment out of the conversation if it comes up.   The ladies are professionals. It is a requirement that they enjoy themselves. Some do, some don't. It's always better when they do."
Hookers,39uqz6,Daty_Dato,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:51:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm pretty sure my provider had some enjoyable experiences with me.  She was fun to talk to.  I really valued giving and receiving massages more than the sex. Even in typical hookups, you can't be totally certain a woman wasn't faking enthusiasm."
Hookers,39uqz6,bredontopology,2,Mon Jun 15 01:33:25 2015 UTC,I like it!
Hookers,39uqz6,Daty_Dato,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:15:49 2015 UTC,"If you aren't a pig and the lady is at least somewhat interested in having a good time, they will enjoy their time but it is their choice if they want to have fun. Just because they don't have a gushing O doesn't mean they aren't having fun. It might surprise you but many women enjoy sex without having an orgasm. Bone up on your oral skills your dates with be a lot more fun :)  Or as many guys do, go, have your fun and leave. It really is supposed to be about you. That's what you are paying for."
Hookers,39uqz6,thebillstone,0,Mon Jun 15 01:21:51 2015 UTC,"I can never know for sure though if she really enjoyed the sex or is always in business mode with every client.    From my experience, they're always in business mode  despite making you kind of believe otherwise (hence why they're called tricks), but this would be a good thing to ask r/sexworkers. Maybe there are women who genuinely enjoy it (or at least with a few of their clients), even if they are in the minority.   Escorts give little validation also because they will generally see most men as long as they have the money, and sometimes references. It is far more satisfying to have sex with someone who genuinely likes you, but escorts are good for dry spells which are inevitable."
Hookers,39uehv,Straight_Jackin_it,3,Sun Jun 14 21:30:58 2015 UTC,"Maybe develop a relationship with a provider by repeat visits and being a good client, and talking to them about what you would like."
Hookers,39uehv,pee-pro,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:50:14 2015 UTC,"That's a good idea and I've thought about it. The problem is is that I think that there is a more than fair chance of them saying ""no"" if they weren't already up for the sort of thing I want to begin with, and I'm only really semi-interested in paying for vanilla sex unless I can find like a chick I would rate as one of the hottest I've ever seen.  --And I'm pretty sure that a chick that hot wouldn't probably be interested in what I'd like, so there's kind of a catch-22 problem. But still it is something to consider, I'm thinking about going fishing this week at a strip club to see what turns up."
Hookers,39uehv,seeking2sugar,2,Mon Jun 15 08:37:48 2015 UTC,"Na,you'll find someone. You may have to pay more but so be it. I do agree that you should build trust with a provider by becoming a good reliable and respectful client. Not many quality providers  will let you be rough with them without knowing they can trust you."
Hookers,39uehv,Delicatefukinflower,2,Tue Jun 16 05:34:22 2015 UTC,"To be honest, make the appointment, and when you meet with her, let her know what you want. The worst she can say is no. These girls are pros and even if they are not willing to get facefucked on the first call, she'll know what to expect as the relationship comtinues. That way you don't waste your money. She'll almost certainly be willing to compromise."
Hookers,39uehv,manwhore25,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:47:57 2015 UTC,"I'ma probably try that. One of the chicks gave me their number last time I was in the stripclub but I never called it, I'll be on the lookout for her when I go back this week."
Hookers,39uehv,Daty_Dato,2,Mon Jun 15 19:30:44 2015 UTC,"Get to know your provider and build a relationship. I've been lucky with a few girls who we're okay with a facefuck right off the bat, which was awesome."
Hookers,39uehv,NY_Hobbyist,2,Mon Jun 15 20:25:09 2015 UTC,"If you get on TER, and post as ISO for what you want there are ladies that offer what you want. Ladies that you won't even phase with the facefucking thing.   As for more extreme things. They may offer it or others might. You might be surprised what some providers are into. Punching, choking, dick stomping. Most anything you can think of you could probably find someone that will let you. But you are going to pay. I highly doubt a  stripper at a club is going to offer that shit."
Hookers,39tuzc,john130420,2,Sun Jun 14 18:47:41 2015 UTC,"You had sex, found you could live without it. She didn't allow kissing r Daty and you want to see her again?  So much better available... Why not try someone else first?>  You probably didn't ruin it with the wallet thing but only she knows that."
Hookers,39tuzc,Daty_Dato,3,Sun Jun 14 19:34:07 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, her sex was amazing,  as good as it gets. She was really trying to go at it and would moan and everything. I just meant that I had built up sex with an escort so much in my head, that I was bound to be a little surprised by the reality of it.  There are absolutely no other girls in my area I would go see. They're all too expensive and not my type of girls. This girl is perfect for me in the looks department.   She's known to have an attitude problem though. When I read her reviews people would say she had an attitude over the phone but was nice in person. So it's not like her getting angry at me for accusing her was shocking, far from it."
Hookers,39tuzc,manwhore25,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:20:37 2015 UTC,"welcome to the hobby, now find a girl thats even better than her."
Hookers,39tuzc,manwhore25,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:34:18 2015 UTC,You wouldn't visit this girl even if she's really hot?  Also what do you think about the wallet incident?
Hookers,39tuzc,CrankyYankeeNoSpanky,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:33:36 2015 UTC,you over-think things man. you misplacing your wallet was an accident and there's no hard feelings. You could go back and see her and she'd be happy to see you.
Hookers,39tuzc,CrankyYankeeNoSpanky,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:26:09 2015 UTC,"My suggestion is to make nice like you would with any person with whom you had an interaction like this (that is, what seemed to have come across as a ""maybe you took my wallet"" accusation): Contact her and apologize profusely for the misunderstanding.  Tell her that you found your wallet. In the future, if you are going to be engaging in an activity that is (sadly) illegal, you should strive to be fully present and alert -- leaving behind your wallet by mistake is a sign of fogginess that can't be good. As far as wallets go, I will often leave my wallet and nice watch at home on purpose.  I show up with only the donation and maybe some extra tip or pocket money.  No need to have a stack of credit cards, etc., sitting in my pants while I shower (or whatever) Edit: trying to explain myself better"
Hookers,39tsy6,ichijiteki,4,Sun Jun 14 18:31:22 2015 UTC,"Never pre-pay.  There was a recent fiasco on my local TER between a well reviewed high-end escort, and a client with many reviews. Long story short, he had pre-paid for a couple hours and she kept postponing the date. After several attempts to finalize a date, he asked for the pre-payment back, and she never did. It wasn't until after he posted his grievances on the board, and her attempt to defend herself that the monies were re-paid."
Hookers,39tsy6,Frozen-Chimi,3,Sun Jun 14 20:51:34 2015 UTC,"There are girls who go for a lower rate, but that also usually means they are of lower quality of you know what I mean. It really depends on the market though. If you have a trusting relationship with a particular girl, there shouldn't be a problem telling her there are budget constraints. I don't think prepaying would be necessary, just be honest about your situation. It is amazing you strive to be a great client, I love guys like you. They are the best."
Hookers,39tsy6,Delicatefukinflower,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:42:49 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily agree completely with you on this one.  Best dates I've had 400 for 3 hours, (x3)  235 (1) 250 (2) 250(1)  200 (1)  I've had 600 (1), 500 a few times and all sorts at 400.  The 600 wasn't even top 20, the 500 was maybe bottom of top 20. At 400, most are very good.    These aren't including dinner dates that were more expensive.  So Yes, I agree at the bottom of the market you get what you are paying for but I've found plenty of ladies in the 250 an hour range that where fantastic. Full GFE, passionate ""love"" making. Pro's pros as it were."
Hookers,39tsy6,Daty_Dato,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:09:44 2015 UTC,"Then we agree, I said it depends on the market. I know great providers who offered low rates that were indicative of the market. Your not going to charge a 500 minimum fee in a mid size city for regular daytime calls. But your also not going to get a semi retired former porn star for less then a grand. It all depends on where you are geographically. Ho economics as it were."
Hookers,39tsy6,Delicatefukinflower,0,Tue Jun 16 01:19:16 2015 UTC,"Dude there are plenty of ladies available for less then what you are paying.  You don't need to tip. I stopped doing so long ago. When they are making 300+ an hour they don't need a tip...  Yes some ladies offer deals. buy 9 get 10th free kind of thing. Prepaid up front. A bit risky, but possibly worth it."

Hookers,39trsa,johnjohnawaythrow,4,Tue Jun 16 07:41:19 2015 UTC,"Strongly suggest not using your home. You need some distance between you and the provider. You don't want the providers friends paying a visit to your home while you're at work/school. Use ECCIE, there should be one for Texas."
Hookers,39trsa,watchoutradioman,4,Mon Jun 15 03:40:47 2015 UTC,"I have a few rules I typically follow. Of course these are not completely effective and are only meant to help avoid a LE encounter.  - If I haven't seen the girl on BP/TER/whatever before, I wait until I see multiple posts over 2-3 weeks.  - Google her phone number and look to see if there are multiple different ads associated with that number (same girl) - Tineye her photos to see if there are any matches - Never set up an appointment over text (or any writing) - Focus on girls who offer outcalls and ask if they're willing to meet at your place/hotel. May change to Incall after I verify they offer and are willing to meet at outcalls (LE stings are typically In). - General evaluation of impression over the phone (any red flags - explicitly saying things like ""I charge $100 for 30 minutes of sex."" Normally girls will be as general and generic as possible (""My time"" or ""Donation for a massage"") - Show up to her place 5-10 minutes early and park a distance away. Walk around the area looking for anything suspicious (helps if you're able to get the room# before hand)  To avoid fakes/scams/robs: - If the ad looks too good to be true, it probably is. Professional photos, super hot slim blonde girls, etc. Unless she's verified or I find strong evidence to suggest she is legit. - Never give money in advance. Never let a girl leave with money to ""buy condoms"" or ""pay for the hotel room"" - Girls sometimes advertise ""Independent"" on their ads meaning no pimps, bfs, etc looking over them. I prefer these girls to avoid any situations but again, this is not completely effective.  Also, I would highly recommend NOT meeting a girl at your parents house. I only do outcalls to my place after I've seen a girl on multiple occasions and even then I tend to avoid it."

(The ho stroll) You also have to worry about having some strange woman know where you live and have access to your property. Your best bet is to get a hotel, have her meet you there. After the initial meeting doesn't end up with either of you in cuffs, subsequent visits can occur at your home, once your comfortable.

Hookers,39o1ay,Daty_Dato,2,Sat Jun 13 05:49:55 2015 UTC,"thank you ser, I believe I shall make sweet love to this lady of the night within a fortnight"
Hookers,39o1ay,VagabondSamurai,3,Sat Jun 13 06:01:11 2015 UTC,Just don't call her m'lady and don't wear your fedora...   Shaving the neck beard at a minimum... :)
Hookers,39m8fm,TheOldestProfession,2,Fri Jun 12 18:51:26 2015 UTC,"Flakiness is my #1 annoyance. I don't deal with it well. I usually just tell them I'm not interested anymore.  Give her a break. A good long break. Find some new talent. Circle back to her after a few months. If she calls seeking you out just say you are busy. She'll probably get the message but like you said, she's the best time you've had, hard to give that up.   I have little experience with this. I only had one ATF and she retired (ripe old age of 24..)  before I could make it a real regular thing. I saw her 4 times. Last time with her was with her friend. :)  Some guy took her off the market.. Lucky guy..  She was a freak.  Great rate and blew me away every time. She only flaked on me once. But there was plenty of notice. I was willing to tolerate her idiosyncrasies because of the service provided.   I have one other I would make a regular but she's a bit to far away and isn't flaky but she often delays responses. She's been around a long time has lots of regulars and is mostly UTR so she can afford to be that way.. Its only slightly frustrating occasionally. She give a hell of a massage and is simply the best at BLS I've seen. Great rate as well.   As with the above ladies, the rate and service where top shelf so it was worth putting up with a little bs. With ladies I haven't seen before I don't tolerate much.  The hour before cancellation is a huge no no and many guys would stop seeing her completely.   You probably didn't actually move away from her being flaky, you just had a good run of it for a while..."
Hookers,39m8fm,Daty_Dato,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:20:48 2015 UTC,"That's the thing, the lady I see gives me a great price for her beauty to brains ratio and she is just incredible in bed. Like best sex I have ever had type of stuff.  But this last time... I don't know. The lack of respect is really getting to me. I am nothing but kind and courteous to her, and always tip her well and bring something nice for us to sip on, and she has always complimented me as to how I am her favorite client. I was so excited to see her again and then to get an email that says we can't meet up RIGHT BEFORE we meet up just hurt me. Worst thing is she hasn't responded to my email to maybe find another time this weekend, and has kind of left me in the dark.   Thanks for your reply though man, really enjoyed reading it."
Hookers,39m8fm,Daty_Dato,0,Fri Jun 12 20:14:48 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely take a break from her. Make her realize that you are a great client and that she's missing out on a great date with all the extras. If she's smart she'll get the message.  Maybe she got a better offer or something outside of the hobby happened. I'd stop contact for at least a month. In the mean time, find a replacement. Always have a backup plan. Obviously you don't mean as much to her as you think or like I said something happened."
Hookers,39m8fm,Delicatefukinflower,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:32:47 2015 UTC,"If this was an isolated incidence I'd say cut her a break, but sounds like she doesn't value your time, or you as a client. I'd find a new provider, and only resume business after some time passed. She'll realize her mistake when you stop being available. Or she'll move on, as will you, and hopefully with a new reliable provider. I'm sorry that's happening to you."
Hookers,39m8fm,goldfishpaws,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:18:36 2015 UTC,"Very valid points! It just hurts because we've spent so much time together and I assumed we had a mutual understanding and even a friendship going on. We would chat outside of our time together about books and music we like so I thought we had just a bit of a deeper connection than the average provider and client setup.   Either way, I think a little no contact will be good for both of us. Or do you suggest I say something?"
Hookers,39m8fm,Frozen-Chimi,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:21:19 2015 UTC,"Just for clarity, you're a John who gives her money in return for making you feel special.  Words are cheap - 'favourite client' costs nothing at all, and indeed she may find you regular easy money. If faking a deeper connection means more money, why wouldn't she say those words?  Roles reversed, I certainly would.  Let her actions speak instead - she has a life outside of the few hours you spend together, and it's more important to her."

Hookers,39j2lf,xxHazzardousxx,2,Fri Jun 12 14:45:56 2015 UTC,"I prefer no kissing, but often end up doing light, lips only, kissing because quality providers seem to expect it.  I want good encounters, but need to be disciplined about safer practices."

Hookers,39j2lf,gothbull,1 point,Fri Jun 12 05:53:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah if you shop on BP you probably find ladies that don't offer it, but saying most don't like it isn't accurate. I've had close to 40 dates, and only one didn't kiss. A few others on the low end of the pay scale didn't ""like"" it. All the others where down for lots of kissing but I'm a really good kisser so I'm told... (among other things...)"
Hookers,39kfcp,john130420,5,Fri Jun 12 10:11:03 2015 UTC,"Sounds like she isn't interested.  Busy ladies can be choosey. She probably gets a handful of similar request a week. Stop pestering her, you could try again in a week or two.  She isn't likely to ""cold"" call you. Putting conditions on contacting you was a mistake.   You also should realize that it sometimes takes ladies a few days to get around to verifying a new client if they are even taking new guys from their website...  If you cease contact for a week or two, you may have not permanently screwed yourself. Hard to say, she may have already blocked you or like I said just hasn't gotten around to verifying you.  She won't have blacklisted you. You haven't mentioned anything that would rise to that level. Yet.  A good system for contacting a lady...  Fill out the web form (I never do) and give her a few days to see it, verify you and contact you. If you didn't hear back after a few days send an email and mention that you filled out the form and are still interested in getting to know her. Maybe, one more email a week later, mentioning your request. If she doesn't respond she isn't interested at this time. Move along.  Guys always have a back up plan. I personally don't use the web forms but only give ladies a day or so to respond before contacting someone else. If they are to slow, we'll have to try another time if I found another date and they finally get back to me. If I'm looking for a date a week or more in advance I might give then an addition day to get back to me."
Hookers,39kfcp,Daty_Dato,0,Fri Jun 12 12:35:34 2015 UTC,"Good news everyone! She posted her ad again 2 hours ago and I thought why not call her and see if she answers, and guess what she picked up the phone. Unfortunately she's only hosting outcalls tonight so I'm going to give her a call when she posts a new ad for incalls. Wow I worried over nothing when it was just a reason as simple as her not posting any recent ads. I'm happy that she'll be open to me when I call her for the incall appointment in the future!  Another lesson learned: don't jump to conclusions!"
Hookers,39kfcp,Frozen-Chimi,-1,Sat Jun 13 04:01:19 2015 UTC,"I also forgot to mention that the VERY last call I made, I left a voicemail for her.   She doesn't have any verification process, she just takes calls, emails, and booking requests through her website.  Also, how can she not be interested in me but be interested in someone else when she hasn't seen or talked to anyone that has TRIED to contact her, but she didn't respond back or answer the phone call, such as in my situation?"

I haven't tried calling her since 3 days ago so I hope I'm not too late.   Also I forgot to mention that I tried calling her ONCE before this incident when I was up at 2 in the morning, BUT I got nervous and hung up after it rang like once MAYBE twice. Do you think the call went through and would it weird her out that she would get a call at 2 in the morning? It's not like I stayed up just to call her, I just stay up late because I'm still in my early 20's."
Hookers,39kfcp,Frozen-Chimi,3,Fri Jun 12 19:47:48 2015 UTC,"Slow down young buck.  If she doesn't call back, just leave it at that. It is in no way a reflection of you or who you are, etc. She just chose not to respond for ""X"" reason.  However if you keep badgering her, you may get blacklisted. Some providers share numbers of who NOT to talk to.  Find another provider, keep calm, and make sure you properly protect yourself.  I'd try again in a week."
Hookers,39kfcp,Daty_Dato,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:43:38 2015 UTC,Properly protect yourself...explain please? I want to know what that means.

Hookers,39kfcp,watchoutradioman,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:00:30 2015 UTC,"She certainly has a verification process, you just don't know what it is. She doesn't just take calls, emails and book a guy without checking him out in some way. If she does, she's an idiot.  She doesn't know you and you didn't contact her through a site such as P411,TER,Eccie or another, so you are nobody; you could be anyone.   It probably isn't personal, there are numerous reasons she might not respond. Give her some time, if she doesn't respond, try again after a week. If she still doesn't respond she isn't interested.   Ladies that are well known, don't generally need to see new guys. They leave that for the more desperate ladies. They can be selected and see veteran hobbyists with references.  Why would she want to risk a date with the unknown when she can get dates from guys that have a track record?"
Hookers,39kfcp,watchoutradioman,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:03:00 2015 UTC,How can she not be interested in ME....I wouldn't see you either!
Hookers,39kfcp,Daty_Dato,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:38:25 2015 UTC,"There could be a number of reasons why they won't respond to your requests. She could be on vacation, traveling to another city, taking a break, maybe she quit, maybe she was busy with regulars and doesn't want new clients, etc. You're being too aggressive contacting her which might make her think you're a creep. I wouldn't contact her anymore if I were you. Just because you fill out some form and called doesn't put you in front of the line."

Hookers,39jfqn,nj_dude,5,Fri Jun 12 03:41:44 2015 UTC,"No, more communication isn't a good idea. If she's active, and interested she'll contact you. If not, move along. It might be that she's traveling or taking a break. I'd give it another week, send one more missive and leave it at that. Pestering her guarantees no date."
Hookers,39jfqn,Daty_Dato,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:52:18 2015 UTC,"thank you!  Sigh, looks like I'll have to give up on her. So, I should start searching p411 for other providers in NJ?"
Hookers,39jfqn,Daty_Dato,3,Fri Jun 12 04:01:44 2015 UTC,Should be plenty to choose from. If you are looking on P411 and contacted her through the site if she's active she's seen your message. It isn't recommended and doesn't always work but I often contact ladies to see if they are available with PM's. but P411 staff doesn't like it. If you don't have enough Okay's she may just ignore your message. Its viewed as safer to ignore then decline a meeting. Some guys get their tightie whities in a bunch when they get rejected.

Maybe a cold or the flu from kissing, but that ain't coming out of her pussy/ass. You're a bunch of ignorant fucks who make me sad for the girls that had to deal with you. By you, I mean every fucking guy that posts on here about how 'dirty' an escort is or how to look to see if she's 'clean'. If you want to fuck hookers, grow up and learn somethings about sexual health or just jerk off to porn at home. Rant Over."
Hookers,39buih,CourtofOwlz,7,Wed Jun 10 20:04:55 2015 UTC,"Fucking spot on, this subreddit makes me weep for the girls who have to see these type of guys. Like jesus fucking christ, read up on things if you are so worried about your health but don't dare come on here and bitch and moan about the person you saw because you got sick 24 FUCKING HOURS AFTER YOU SAW HER.  NEWS FLASH YOU DUMB FUCKS, IT'S NOT POSSIBLE!   This subreddit is exactly why most of the providers I see get burned out on people. You are demanding, rude, inexperienced, and just generally lack any sort of social skills."
Hookers,39buih,TheOldestProfession,4,Thu Jun 11 16:39:27 2015 UTC,"If you'd read his post you'd know that he didn't just fuck her, he rimmed her too. There are lots of bacteria back there, especially if her hygiene isn't top notch. It could well give him an infection.  Or he could have gotten it from a completely unrelated source. We don't know."
Hookers,39buih,manslutalt,10,Thu Jun 11 11:35:48 2015 UTC,"Again, you guys are all smoking dope or fucking retarded if you are taking this yokel at face value that he got diarrhea from rimming a prostitute. You guys are all stretching for some piece of evidence that doesn't exist. If a doc who works with planned parenthood (i.e. someone who routinely deals with STIs) wants to chime in, I'll eat crow. However, the more likely case is he got sick and his anxiety drove him to illogically point towards the escort.  First this guy acts as if GFE is something unique. It's not. Then he suspects the prostitute he paid had sex with other men, thus making her dirty. Well, fuck me. A hooker that sees multiple customers. Shocking. Then he blames her for a stomach illness as she must be some super dirty whore that has the worst bacteria b/c she has sex. You gotta be fucking kidding me. The paranoia, absurd logic, and downright ignorance about sex/STIs on here is laughable. I come on here and it's like 6th grade sex ed class of morons.  The only illness this guy has is what I call 'newbie-itis'. Newbies are prone to blame a prostitute post act if they feel an iota of illness or sickness. They all have absurd fears that every hooker has the worst disease just sitting in her pussy (in this case ass) and these girls just get off on giving it to customers. Again, it's a profession. The vast majority of working girls take health serious (street prostitution is a different game). Guys come on here and think they got full blown aids from a covered BJ. This post is just more moronic than the usual 'is she clean' thread.  Anyone defending this guy is either an idiot, naive, or both. This is my swan song on this sub, so I'm not pulling punches. Most of y'all shouldn't be fucking working girls if you're going to be such pansy ass motherfuckers about it. Man up. Wrap up and get tested routinely. If you can't deal with casual sex with strangers, then go find a wife/gf or jerk off at home."

And newsflash, OP: if you're seeing a GFE provider, there's a damned good chance that she pays much more attention to her personal hygiene than an actual girlfriend.  Her livelihood depends on it, after all.  Now if you're all afraid of getting cooties, get over it.  She trades various bodily fluids with various dudes.  This is her job.  Jesus, you wouldn't be saying this shit if you were tongue-punching your girlfriend's shitbox and got a tummy ache because your girlfriend is a fucking virgin and a saint, but you do it to a whore, and all of a sudden, ""OMG, she's fucking filthy!""

Hookers,39buih,CourtofOwlz,7,Wed Jun 10 20:09:08 2015 UTC,"No idea what I was thinking, I guess I figured a gfe provider would be cleaner but I guess not because she's actually making out with people too - probably even worse.   Apparently a 'gfe' provider (is there any other type worth $$$?) isn't cleaner than whatever place you been slumming. GFE is very standard for the vast majority of escorts posting on reputable sites and who are reviewed. It's not some esoteric service. It's practically 'the service' over a certain price point.  You're getting my vitriol b/c I'm shocked at every tom, dick, and harry that posts here with some dumb, asinine shit about STDs or how 'dirty' these hookers are even though you guys are putting your tongue up their ass.   This is  these girls' profession. You think they just want to get sick or are all just 'std riddled'? Use your fucking heads. If as many girls had STDs as guys who post here before/after they see an escort, every hooker would be a walking smorgasbord of STDs. The main point is 99% of these posts are bullshit from a guy who is all anxiety filled and asking lazy, fear-mongering questions.  I don't know you personally, but this fucking sub is so goddamn amateur hour that I just got to get off of it. I ain't mad, but simply depressed at the low level, ignorant, and stupid shit that's posted here daily about 'STDs' or 'is she legit'. Just man up. Do research. Use protection. This world is not that complicated nor difficult.   Your post is the type of shit that makes guys like me who could probably give advice to those who need it just say 'fuck it, I'm done'."

Hookers,3996x9,Daty_Dato,2,Wed Jun 10 12:39:51 2015 UTC,"On p411 providers get an email with most of the information that they need. She may well just use that information or just think P411 is enough. I've seen ladies that do this all the time. Some well known ladies. They do see your okays, and how long you've been a member.  Recent lady I saw, said that over 6 months was her cut off for not doing more screening. She also need at least 3 or more Okays from other recognizable ladies.  I'd be concerned that she's banned but without knowing why, and not being banned from P411 wouldn't cut her off instantly. The BP ad can just be a sign she's in a dry spell. Did you check TER?  LE is't likely, and I explained the screening.   I was told by P411 about 50% of ladies that use the site, don't read the guys profiles... It concerned me when it happened to me the first time, now it seems to happen at least every other time. But I have more then 20 Okays and years on the site so I can understand why ladies wouldn't. Many providers simply don't care what you look like or what you are in to."
Hookers,3996x9,Daty_Dato,1 point,Thu Jun 11 10:47:29 2015 UTC,"It's troubles me that more providers aren't going through the rigorous screening. The tools are there to be used. There's many stories of john ending up being creeps, assholes, or dangerous so why not screen. And then I hear stories of LE making it past the screens with fraudulent okay or references that providers accept without question. Certainly for the prices that are advertised you would expect some sort of filter - a filter that may not always work but should be used nonetheless."
Hookers,3996x9,Daty_Dato,2,Fri Jun 12 02:49:32 2015 UTC,"Providers, reviewed providers are rarely busted. P411 was penetrated a few years ago when a john gave up his account. No screening would have fixed that. I've not heard of any thing recently. Its far to costly and inefficient to use Ter/eccie/P411 as a vehicle to bust people. Getting one or two people isn't worth LE's time. They use BP, clip the low hanging fruit to satisfy the masses for a while.   The best screening method against LE is recent referrals but not all that many john's see ladies often enough for it be all that effective. Then it would be places like RS2K, P411, etc...  but no screening method is a 100%.   I don't personally worry about it all that much. I have few issues getting ""dates"".  If and its very rare these days, I get any push back I just move on.  I'm not jumping through hoops anymore."
Hookers,3996x9,veryfinechick,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:21:43 2015 UTC,Haha I can't imagine a man with 20 Okays having any trouble finding dates. You certainly pass any and all tests no questions there. I on the other hand fall on the newb side so I'll stick with cautious tactics.  We'll have to disagree with the presence of LE within ECCIE and P411. I can't prove anything obviously but there's so many stories of LE targeting providers it shouldn't be ignored. There's even rumors of LE working alongside the owners of said places. If true it's going to become a powder keg.
Hookers,3996x9,veryfinechick,2,Fri Jun 12 17:55:53 2015 UTC,"It happens but its very rare, sure it probably happens now and again, but well reviewed ladies with a track record that are doing this for the longer run aren't giving up their clients/reputation for a prostitution ticket. Many of these ladies are making 5k or more a month some much more. They aren't giving that up for a ticket..  BP is so easy for LE to use, they could do it constantly. They don't because prostitution (adult) isn't a priority. So unless the police are getting complaints or its election time, they hardly bother actively busts guys/providers.  Writing a fictitious review or asking for a date isn't illegal. I personally never discuss activities or money unless its face to face and its after we've started going at it. Money rarely comes up, once or twice ever. Sometimes a discount is offered for repeat business or a review or I'll inquire about doubles..  I don't need to discuss activities, I read their reviews, I know whats on the menu and don't push their boundaries. I really easy going and can roll with what ever is offered.  Closer to 30 Okays...  one lady said she found it creepy that a guy would have 100 okays so I guess I'll have to start deleting at some point....   Again, guys I almost only see ladies with 50 or more reviews. Often many many more. One lady have 400+ (she was fantastic)  I don't seek out new providers they are flaky and more dangerous."

As for knowing my preferences, if a provider takes the time to read and actually remember what I like then I'm much more happier with my experience and the service and more likely to repeat and review well not to mention tip better.

Came into my bedroom,  tried to entice me with a big wad of cash that he showed me, but stuffed back into his pocket...tried to solicit me...am I going to get sex?  I froze, then I looked at the ceiling and laughed like a crazy woman before I go my wits about me and told him flat out...you're going to get my prime time and undivided attention all relative to how much money you put in my hand in the next two seconds...two seconds went by, I told him, this isn't going to work and walked right past him out of the room and straight to the door...opened it and waited for him to leave, and he did, because he really didn't have a choice, I wasn't going to give him what he needed to arrest me, a discussion about the sex acts I would engage in to get a piece of the roll he had in his pocket, and he wasn't going to stand in my bedroom all day by himself, and he left without making an arrest and perhaps a little respect for me. Its against the law to sell blow jobs and intercourse it's not against the law to sell my prime time. I knew it and he knew I knew it, and he let it go.   So that's how I've avoided law enforcement, by not soliciting, by not breaking the law. Simple as that!"

If you hobby enough in any city (NYC, LA, ect.) you'll run out of girls pretty quickly in a 6 month span that are your type.  I guesstimate about every 3 years there's around a 50% turnover.

Hookers,38vcng,nyce611,1 point,Sun Jun 7 05:18:41 2015 UTC,"Depending on where you are from, the average price is probably closer to 200-350 an hour. Some areas, NY, CHI etc.. may be more.  Supply and demand. Of course you can find lower prices on BP. Usually comes will lesser service as well. If all you want it to stick your dick in for 10-20 minutes BP may be the route to go. Don't expect anything special though I'm sure excellent service exists with BP girls. What happens is if they are into doing it full time and don't have a lot of personal issues/drugs etc... high quality ladies move away from BP. They don't need it. They can make a lot more once they prove they provide excellent service. They get better clients who are willing to pay more for better service. Older guys usually businessmen can afford to pay the higher rates but they expect high quality service and don't want issues so they generally avoid BP.   Go luck. What's up with that deformed ass? Scary.."
Hookers,38vcng,Daty_Dato,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:32:41 2015 UTC,Girls undercut prices all the time for a reason. I never see a 1/2 hr girl. I don't know why you guys think with your dicks and get all excited that some girl is offering herself for peanuts. 99/100 times its for a reason and won't be worth a penny.

Hookers,38ssx9,Daty_Dato,1 point,Sat Jun 13 11:45:00 2015 UTC,"One review doesn't tell us much. Often guys get a discount for helping the lady with the review. The scores are inflated. That doesn't mean she isn't legit, but there is some risk there.  At 150 an hour, I'd suspect she isn't 8/9.    Personally I don't see girls with one review. I've learned from experience that the best experiences I have are with ladies with 20 or more reviews. It weeds/evens out the fake/puffed up reviews. I recently saw a lady that had 10 in looks from 3 or 4 of her latest reviews. Had about 10 reviews total. I'm not even all that picky but she was a 6 could have gone 5. After 20 reviews someone usually a few guys will post legit reviews.   So she might be fine, I don't know and I wouldn't risk it. Pretty much every experience I've had with ladies with few reviews has been average/good never great.   Reviews are often bullshit. I saw a few other ladies recently as well, One was one of the highest rated in my area and guess what, she was overpriced by about double and she even admitted without me saying anything that she wasn't very pretty, yet her looks scores where well over 9. Facially she was a 5. Body yes, it was a 9. Or the other one, age was claimed to be 40ish she looked 55 to me...  Good luck, at that price, I wouldn't worry to much about it. You might want to contact the one guy that did the review see if he'll say something different. Often after a period of time, you have a different feeling about the experience."

Hookers,38ld1f,throwaway23302,4,Thu Jun 4 23:32:29 2015 UTC,"It's really up to you what information you want to disclose. You may mention ""inexperience"" just to explain away any nerves Mostly what kind of experience you want, I.e girlfriend, party girl.. Any details you want paid attention to, maybe you like a particular scent, or type of clothing you'd like her to wear.  As long as you don't smell bad, and have clean nails, feet and genitals. We know bacne and hair are normal It's at the providers discression, if you look freshly showered probably not, but some providers require it as a security screening.  I usually like for things to progress naturally, but if you're nervous, you may want her to take the lead. Let her know that before hand. It's really important to think about what kind of experience you want to have, and be honest about that. Everyone is entitled to enjoy themselves, and your lucky to be with a partner who truly is invested in you having a great time. Be a little selfish, but resonable and always kind. Depends on the market where you are, but generally ""donations"" are based on experience, the happier you are the more you should donate. You may ask your provider if the price is all inclusive, but where I'm from, the price you pay is for the appointment, lowest donation is 500 for the GFE,(girlfriend experience), it goes up from there.    Good luck! Have fun and be safe.   Edit:grammar"
Hookers,38ld1f,Delicatefukinflower,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:27:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, you addressed a lot of my concerns.  I am wondering about a few other things now based on what you said. When you said that I should have an idea of what sort of experience i'm looking for, could you elaborate on that a little more? Again, I've had no experience with this, so maybe I'm just being a little dense here, but I don't know if you're referring to something specific to meeting with an escort.  Also, with regards to your comments about tipping, when should I ask what is included? Before meeting with her, or at the actual appointment before we start, after we start? It seems like the ads I've read have actively discouraged talking about or haggling over the price of a meeting. When you said ""the price you pay is for the appointment, lowest donation is 500 for GFE"" did you mean 500 is an average rate for that service, or I should be expected to give that much more to receive GFE?"
Hookers,38ld1f,Delicatefukinflower,2,Sun Jun 7 04:02:24 2015 UTC,"As to concern one, try and be able to communicate any areas of your body you'd like pencil attention paid to. If not that maybe you'd like her to take the lead and be gentle....etc....you really want a porno her on top dramatic cowgirl shit...stuff like that.    As to donations, specific cities have there going rate for a call in escort appointment depending on independent contractors or management service/pimp situation. If the rate she is qouting under three hundred, there is usually an understanding a donation will be provided. But some girls these days,on sites like Craigslist, will charge a flat 250 and that's ""all inclusive""."
Hookers,38ld1f,malbert8808,2,Sun Jun 7 16:22:58 2015 UTC,"1) I don't think it would be an issue at all. It is up to you weather or not you want to disclose that information. If you do, I'd suggest what Delicate mentioned as ""inexperience""  2) How long you're looking for (30/60/longer), in or outcall. Depending on the girl, she may also ask age, race, or for any references.  3) No. Just be freshly showered, cut nails, fresh breath. Maybe groom a bit down there. the more presentable and clean you are, the happier she is.  4) Not usually. In my experience it's only happened once and that was at a legal brothel.   5) Some girls explicitly ask you (in the ad) to lie down the money on the dresser when you arrive. Usually I'll arrive, make small talk, and just leave the money on the dresser during our conversation (within a minute or two of arriving). Some girls will ask right away for the money.   Tips for LE: One tip I received from a girl is that she usually watches to see if her client undresses at the same rate i.e. she'll undo her belt bucket and observe if he does the same or starts to take off another article of clothing.  Another thing some girls do is ask you to kiss them, touch them, etc (not sure if this actually effective).   6) I wouldn't say so. I've only tipped a few times and that's when I received exceptional service (girls i've also seen multiple times). At a minimum I give an extra $20 but have given up to $50 (regardless of rate).   Hope that helps!"

Hookers,38k6cj,alyssums,2,Thu Jun 4 19:25:58 2015 UTC,"The girls that I've always gone back to usually have very similar characteristics:   They are genuinely outgoing and like to make the session fun. They joke, compliment, and control the conversation. They put me at ease and make me feel more relaxed. This probably differs wildly but someone who is slightly introverted like me, I love.  They do what they say they're going to do. If that's specific services, hang out for the entire time I paid for, and this includes accurate photos. They are clean and professional. Freshly showered and make an effort to get ""dolled up."" One of my biggest pet-peeves during a session is when they answer or text on their phone. Mute it and ignore!   Some instant negatives:   Dirty and smelly. Nope. Ruins the entire session.  Boyfriend, pimp, or any other male ""friend"" that makes himself known before, during, or after the session.  Picture bait-and-switch.  Any girl known to offer BBFS. Tougher to determine but if I found out anyway, skipping. Won't risk it even with protection. ""Just use me"" mentality. What I mean by that is those girls who literally get undressed and lay on the bed like they were sleeping. No talking, not enjoying anything, no moaning or whimpering. Literally just laying there until I finish."
Hookers,38k6cj,malbert8808,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:53:02 2015 UTC,"In general I rarely repeat. I only repeat with ladies that offer very high level service at what I find is a bargain price otherwise I'll search out someone new. I had one lady that I repeated with 4 times but she left the business, I'd probably had gone close to exclusive with her. She was mind blowing to me and I was getting a great rate. Another I'd see more but is to far away, she's also fantastic. One traveling lady that I'd see all the time if she were local but she isn't.   Each is different and have a different style and different personalities. The one thing is that they turn me on hard, and it isn't about their looks. Its about their sexuality. They love what they do and we have a lot of fun together. What they do have in common is bbbj and kissing and they are all great at it. (for me) I've meet other ladies that guys rave about their kissing and I wasn't impressed at all or about other services so it's one of those things that when you find it, you know. Otherwise I just float from lady to lady hoping to find someone I really like an I may repeat. Its rare like I said."

I'm not talking about the common sense ones(should be), but the ones that make it feel as if I'm being regulated in everything I do. Looks. Obviously bait and switch, I'm leaving immediately. I chose you because of what you look like. Money. Upsells, nickle and diming, etc. Time. I paid for X amount of time. Even if it's not MSOG, I'm still expecting the rest of the time. Attitude. While I dont ecpect you to be into me like a rock star, I do expect you to at least pretend to enjoy my company. Hygiene. Goes both ways Interruptions. Clock watching, reading your text messages, etc. Messy accomodations. I don't want to walk into a place that looks like a teeneager lives there. Smoking. This is a more personal one. Can't stand the smell. No, smoking one before hand and using mouthwash won't get rid of it. I can still smell it on your skin and hair."
Hookers,38k6cj,m1abramtank,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:49:30 2015 UTC,"This was totally informative. Unfortunately I smoke, but my clients usually do too. some of them ask me if I smoke pot and of course I say yes haha. I guess I can't always run into someone that doesn't mind smoking, but generally I do hook up with smokers.  I do all of these things in hopes of keeping a happy, returning customer. I never check my phone, period. I always let men cum as much as they want as long as it's under an hour, I never have rules (other than no ass play) and I will happily swallow as many times as you can feed my hungry mouth. I assume the men that don't want to pay the same rates are usually that way with every escort, I don't take it personally, but I thought I'd ask around to see what men want in an escort."
Hookers,38k6cj,veryfinechick,1 point,Fri Jun 5 05:30:39 2015 UTC,"Your personality sounds completely reasonable here but it is hard to tell without meeting you for real.  But because you already get repeat customers I am sure you are doing just fine in this regard - someone with a repulsive personality just won't get repeats unless they are super hot (which to be honest you're probably not if you're in the USA and only charging 400 a night).  The better you look the better business will be.  This is far and away the most important variable there is.  If you're fat lose weight.  If you're overly skinny (like BMI below 20) then that is probably hurting you, too, on the whole.  One thing a girl can always do to look better is starting to lift weights - it'll give your legs/ass a better shape in pretty much all cases.  A common misconception is that this will make you look muscly but that is just not the case at all.  Another super obvious thing to improve your looks is better clothes/lingerie/make up but none of this is nearly as important as not being fat/too thin.  Post your picture (on a different account or whatever) on a place that rates your appearance and ask for brutally honest feedback about what you could do to look better.  Work on that and watch yourself get more customers.  Edit: nevermind I see your picture now from and old GW post.  You look cute in that picture but I can't see how fit your body is.  Do you wear make up when you visit customers?  You could really make your eyes a lot more beautiful with a bit of effort :)"

Hookers,38eri0,Dynamaxion,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:56:26 2015 UTC,"The catch? It's dinner and sex with people you'd never have dinner or sex with. So maybe for a young guy that could mean....an older, obese, unkempt woman who insists you eat her out and hold her hand in public."

I don't care to know that you had experimented in college with other girls.   All I care about is that we're having sex and having a good time."
Hookers,38eri0,slightlytainted,2,Wed Jun 3 21:23:37 2015 UTC,Ask he what she thinks about sex work in general.  Her answer will speak volumes about how accepting she will or won't be of your past.

I'd definitely check out www.cityvibe.com and www.adultfax.com.  These are two pretty decent sites that seem to have some inter-linking with each other which helps with the validity of things as well as ease of use.  Cityvibe is for finding the girls. You can use Adultfax too, but the other site is where you're going to find an abundance of girls and ads.    Check out the ads, look at the pics.  Some ads will have google image check built right in so you can double check to see if they're fake photos or they're using the same pics on other escort sites.  Then once you find the girl you like, check adultfax for any reviews on her.    But really, this is the game.  You have to check all sides of things to make sure and make the best decision.  It all comes down to your gut feeling and if you feel it's right or not.  If you feel it's not, then move on to the next as there's plenty out there.  Goodluck!"

The catch is that some sources are strong in some locations and weak in others.  For example, Eccie is almost useless in Detroit, but the other three sources are fairly decent.  What you want are a lot of cross-references: find a girl who's on at least two of those sites.  Contact them, let them know you found them on this site and that site.

Acronyms are not so clever that the police do not know what they are. Don't use them. Not only is that soliciting but some women resent having to work in the confines of someone's rigid little list, instead of just having fun.  If no rate is posted, ask for a rate, Do not ask me about donations, I wont book with If you talk to me like I'm a charity.

In my area, escorts who kiss are more likely to market themselves as ""GFE"" (girlfriend experience) but you'll be safest if you can find someone with reviews that say she kisses (also ""DFK"" is ""deep french kissing"") or if you just tell her on the phone what you're looking for. It's bad to talk about actual sex acts on the phone, but I don't think kissing for money is illegal in most places.   Other than that, it doesn't sound like a bad idea to me. The provider will still want to do some level of screening to make sure you're not a cop/stalker/rapist/robber, and you should expect the donation will be the same as for her other clients.   Some sex workers have a service offering called ""intimacy coaching"" where they're deliberately trying to help you get better as a lover/date, the focus of your interaction isn't necessarily your immediate pleasure but is more educational. You might try finding someone local who does this."

Yes, seek out a provider that is WELL known for kissing and set up a normal date. Once you arrive, just explain it to her. She'll probably be happy to help you out.

I live in Tijuana & SD but majority of the time in Tijuana, I know my way around places to get those hoes... lol  You should check Hongkong it's a cool place, you can touch and fuck their girls. You can get a private for $27(NO sex) BUT.! if the girl likes you or think you're good looking she will let you fuck for $27.. hahaha, sex in a hotel with the HK girls is less than $70. Is it worth your money?  YES! it all depends on the girl you get, some look like pornstars n others not so good looking.    There are also girls standing on the street, yes they're hookers. Their price range from $10 - $150 or more it all depends on the girl, I have never been with one of those because they seem more nasty n shit.. lol  you'll see when you come over.   I have never been to Amnesia but indeed some people say it's a good place, if you go there let me know!! :)   There are also those places where you get in a jacuzzi with as many girls you can afford, those places say you can fuck the girls but again it all depends on the girl.   You should check the Bar area in Tijuana in calle sexta(6th street), it's a good place to get a drink and meet some girls if you speak Spanish, majority of people under 30 in Tijuana know English. If you want to get with a horny girls who are not a hookers you should check COCO BONGO it's near Amnesia, majority of the people who go there are DTF! Majority of the people that go are from the U.S.... I have been there and got with 2 girls who where HOT as F**!!! White girl n a Black girl, 3 some... hahaha!!!   There are also Escorts girls they tend to be more expensive but they're better looking and less risk of getting some crazy shit.  Also craigslist girls, lol   MSG me if you have more questions..."

You usually book an hour like any other place. Girls are very flirtatious and fun.   Tijuana has a 'bar' culture, which is a euphemism for whorehouse. The girls are what you'd expect. Some speak enough english to get by, but many don't or 'won't' speak english.  Very reasonable $$ for FS. Tons of hot latin american girls of various sizes. Everyone knows why you're there and they treat you well. Check out TER for reviews of girls at the clubs. I haven't been in a few years, but there are tons of spinners who will be good for your first shot.  Also, There's no look test, secret handshake, or special test to know if someone is 'clean'. HPV and Herpes are skin to skin. Everything else you can mitigate with a condom.

Hookers,381t5l,I_bang_ladyboys,5,Mon Jun 1 17:13:50 2015 UTC,"My job used to take me to SD fairly regularly, and I always made sure to have at least one night in TJ.   When I started a dozen or so years ago, there were a handful of ""bars"" that you could go to and get some quality time with a quality girl for not-too-much money. Over the years, the selection dwindled, though, until in the end I was only frequenting one place: Hong Kong.  They'll force you to buy an overpriced can of beer when you enter, which sucks for someone like me who doesn't drink beer, but whatever. Once inside, plan to spend some time just enjoying the sights. Be sure that you are there long enough to see the shaving cream show. Just trust me that it's unlike anything you've seen before.   Assume that any girl working there is available to go upstairs. Take your time and choose wisely. If you see a girl who looks like she might be a good choice, but you want to see her naked first, just wait a bit: they pretty much all take turns on all of the various dance floors. The two main stages will involve them getting naked, while the girls dancing on the bars and other places probably won't but for $1 she'll show you her goods.   When you make your selection, don't take her up on her offer to go have a seat and talk. Unless you know Spanish, you won't be able to talk anyway, and besides it's basically a scam - as soon as you sit down you'll be buying her a very expensive drink, then paying for a ridiculously overpriced flower and a Polariod. Instead, just tell her directly that you want to go upstairs.  Plan on spending between $70-100, depending on what you want.  The girls on the street behind the club are also all available. It can take some time walking up and down to find one, but quality exists there as well. That'll probably run you $5 for the room and $25-50 for the girl.   When I went, I always enjoyed the company of an HK girl and a street girl. (Not at the same time, mind you.) Sometimes, if I had enough hours to kill, I'd do the street girl and 2 HK girls.  A few additional tips:    Do not drive to TJ. Instead, park at one of the lots at the border and walk across. Grab a cab on the Mexico side and tell the drive you want to go to the Hong Kong club. They all know what it is. That should run you $5. That's unless you go during the day. I never did, but I heard that the walk from the border to HK is nice (DURING THE DAY), but you'll need to know where you're going.  The area around HK is safer than you'd expect. So long as you stay on the main roads or the one alley behind HK (where the street girls are) you'll be fine. If you're going at night, I wouldn't recommend wondering too far afield. And of course don't walk from the border. In general, be aware of your surroundings and cautious, but you don't need to be overly paranoid. Bring only what you need: cash and your passport. Leave your cellphone, wallet, and everything else behind (preferably in your hotel room.) DON'T FORGET YOUR PASSPORT.  The girls want and expect US dollars. I'd suggest that you have at least $50 in $1s for the club, some $5s for the cabs, and the rest in $20s. Assume that no one will give you change. Have a blast, and come back here when you get back and let us know how it went.   :)"

Like I said, I'm bi. 99% of my clients are single men. You mean what would happen if a woman client wanted me to go down on her but her pussy wasn't clean? That's never happened. I'd almost certainly notice while doing the massage then maybe say to have a shower in case the oil made the condom break. Maybe even get in the shower and help if necessary. If still not clean enough, no oral."

Hookers,37yi42,arbivark,2,Sun May 31 22:17:22 2015 UTC,"I think it's mainly biology. Men and women are hormonally completely different and desire for casual, no strings sex is all about testosterone. There are good reasons why we've evolved this way. I had an ex who was transgender and experimenting to figure out how much synthetic estrogen and how much anti-androgen (drug to block testosterone receptors) she needed. Interesting how different aspects of her personality would turn up and down like they were on a dial based on estrogen and testosterone levels. Our emotions really are all chemistry. Society and the media play a role too. It's hard to generalise about the conscious reasons people book escorts though. They're as diverse as the reasons people pay for anything. Subconscious factors like biology, society and the media are all involved though."

It's ain't up to her to wrap you up. Tons of guys want it BB and do it that way. It's up to you. Nothing to do now other than wait it out. If anything starts to burn or lesions show up, go to a doc. Not sure about STD testing sites overseas though. I'd just get tested."
Hookers,3820a6,CourtofOwlz,3,Mon Jun 1 14:03:34 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't stress too much about it, just get tested after a month or so.   HIV is the big worry but the female to male transmission risk is only 1 in 2500 for bareback vaginal and that's IF she has it- the prevalence of which varies between 2.4% for bargirls and 20% for freelancers.  So even in worst case that she was a bargain basement hooker you are looking at a risk in the 1 in 10,000 range, if she was a bargirl more like 1 in 100,000.  If you are staying in Thailand I can recommend the Thai Red Cross at Lumpini Park in Bangkok or Lifecare Lab in Pattaya if it is either of those places, both are cheap (around 300B for a HIV test) and anonymous. No point getting tested immediately though, you have to wait at least a month. Most cities in Thailand have labs that will test, or you can get it done in any public hospital for peanuts."

You're done. But I dug around a bit, and found local forums.  Every civilized city on this planet has a forum where dudes discuss the local 'service providers'. With a little help from google translate, I found a couple well-reviewed girls who looked promising. With a local SIM in my phone (or chatting on the forum, or Yahoo Messenger...) I made contact with one.  She spoke enough broken English to arrange a visit to my hotel room. And for less money than I spend on lunch in a week, I banged a cute, fit, young student.  Twice.

Anything I see on the internet  in relation to Thailand and the sex industry whether guides or escorts seems just unbelievably overpriced, this country is just unbelievably cheap.   If you like Asian girls, I'd really recommend Pattaya in Thailand, lots and lots of girls and the whole process is incredibly straightforward whether you are going for $10-20 freelancers on the beach or $100 supermodels (honestly that is the absolute high end price there, I've never paid more than $25 personally for short time, or $30 for the night). Absolutely no need for a guide, just book your hotel, head out to a bar, the beach or gogo, pick a girl and you'll be either upstairs in the bar or back at your hotel inside her within 10 minutes.   The whole place is basically one big brothel, but it's also absolutely perfectly safe, I have spent a lot of time there with absolutely zero problems.  Wherever you end up going you will almost certainly get a much better deal arranging the details when you get there than trying to get a package deal with a guide. Even if you do go somewhere that you do need a guide, you'll be able to find one locally, motorbike drivers, tuk tuk drivers and taxi drivers generally know where this stuff happens anywhere in the world."

Posing an ad on a site like TER as a sting is a fairly high-cost, low-percentage means of busting a few johns for a misdemeanor. Police generally have better things to do, and would rather go after low-hanging fruit like guys are who are really obvious and stupid in trying to pick up girls on the street. That isn't to say it never happens, just that it's quite rare.  Some free advice: you're thinking of engaging in an illegal activity. There is risk involved in that, regardless of how you choose to partake. You should be cautious and smart, but not paranoid, or you aren't going to get much enjoyment out of this.

South Florida I find is very much an agency place.   They can be hit and miss. The pros are agencies handle the 'business' side for girls. The girls pay a fee or % to the agency for them to book clients, vet them, and advertise. The girls just show up to work and don't have to worry about the hustle that is drumming up reputable business in this world. You'll find agencies are prevalent for girls where english is a second language.   I personally believe independent girls are better as agencies can be very much a revolving door of talent. Definitely had some pull bait and switch moves, where they advertise a super hot girl, but another shows up. Some are awesome and get girls who would never be independent on their own. One I like specializes in latina women who are fucking hot.  Also, I've found the people running agencies can be really shady and pimplike. Sometimes they'll be some dude that just conned a bunch of young girls into working for him.

Really easy to work with, guy will bend over backwards to get a date set up for you, the issue is most of the ladies in his ""stable"" are overprices with fake pictures. The agency still has a lot of cred, and it is completely undeserved.  I saw a lady that claimed PSE. She was tired after 5 minutes of cowgirl. Maybe it was the 30 pounds she put on sense her pictures, pictures the agency is STILL using 6 months later.  All that for about 400 an hour. Another lady doesn't offer kissing. AT 400 an hour? WTF.    I don't use agencies all that much. Some of the best are in my area, but their ladies are usually very young though only I did use a few months ago was fantastic. I talked extensively to her about why she liked the agency instead of being independent. Her reasoning was good. She liked to show up and fuck and she's very good at it. 3 weeks later, she's independent and traveling... Same rate though, think she added greek...    Sold agency don't pull bait and switch, but like I said check the LADIES reviews not the agency. Even a horrible agency can get luck and have a fantastic provider.

Also the quality is vastly better with reviewed ladies. If you can navigate the risk, enjoy substandard service go for it. If you don't mind the fake pictures, not knowing who or what you are getting, do it. I like the known. I like setting up dates with out issue. Knowing pretty much exactly what I can expect and the level of service I like. High quality girls, don't need BP. They get a ton of business from guys that are safe and make more money doing so. But that requires effort. Taking care of yourself, answering your emails/calls. Offering more then a half assed CBJ and no kissing. I have little issue paying upwards of 400 an hour, sometimes more.   If you offer high quality service you'll quickly find yourself on the review sites like TER then to the other verification sites and you'll never want to go back. Who do you want to see, some random guy that calls after seeing your BP add or me off of P411 with more then 20 okays, 20 ladies you can contact to see what I'm like that I'm safe that I'm never a problem and you are very likely to have fun as well?  We aren't saying you can't find quality on BP, it exists but it isn't as easy to find. I know I'm not going to get robbed from a lady with 20 reviews. She's legit. She'll perform. I'll have a good time. The room will be clean, she'll be clean and I have zero anxiety going to meet her.    TER is free. P411 is Free for the ladies. And both provide you with a higher quality john.

TER is the easiest way to figure out if a girl is legit for 99/100 girls. For every escort who says they don't use it, tons need it just to survive. So pat yourself on the back for figuring out a way to 'not starve' as I've met tons of 'no review' girls who do it for a reason. Their service sucks."

Hookers,37jc6p,neoreflux,2,Thu May 28 01:21:24 2015 UTC,"This post is like the xfiles conspiracy theorist of sex posts.   1) It's not hard to find reputable providers with websites that reference greek offerings. Girls usually post ads for your local city on TER/Eros/BP and many of those will have links to their website. Since greek is seen as a rare commodity, they'll upcharge for it.  2) There is no one stop shop to universally search all sexworker ads.  Business is very localized. TER, ERos are international, but only cover those providers willing to pay $$$ to advertise there. You could be the one to figure this out and make a universal site, or be like everyone else and simply search multiple sites.   3) Fear mongering. TER was purchased years ago by a european company. It could potentially be hacked, but no one 'hopefully' uses real names there. Worst case scenario is write a review to get full-time access. Search for greek and save the results of providers that pop up.  4) G-men??? Are we afraid of the red scare as well? Local authorities are interested in 'shaming' arrests. Annual arrests that generate easy revenue and post the guys/girls names and faces in the local paper to scare off anyone interested in sexworkers. Easy solution is to pay more to see well-reviewed providers who offer private incall not to a hotel. Always a risk, but you just got to think with the big head and research reviews."

Until they figure out sex with robots (i.e. Ex Machina), nothing is completely safe. You're taking a risk having sex with anyone new. Condoms can minimize the risk of the big stuff, but herpes/hpv are a Russian roulette game.  This girl probably knows what she's doing. You, on the other hand, are a newbie. I always recommend going through eros and ter for girls with sites that advertise they are newbie friendly. It may cost a little more, but is probably worth it."

The downside to not seeing unreviewed people is that you might miss out on a hidden gem of a sex worker; the upside is that you're much less likely to run across a cop or a robbery/scam.   Just to clarify, you're talking about $150 for 30 minutes, right? That sounds about fair for SFO. If you meant $150 for 90 minutes that is really suspiciously cheap - either she is very new or very worn out/strung out/unattractive or she is a cop/robbery.

Some may be more cautious as you're new, but the best approach is to be upfront and honest with them. Let them know that you'll go through their screening parameters on their website (assuming they have one)."
Hookers,37eqte,CourtofOwlz,1 point,Wed May 27 16:56:42 2015 UTC,"Providers won't admit how they screen.  Some use screening services. RS2K, P411 etc...  Others want your full name and town. Some will check blacklist sites and google you. Some just keep the information and take their chances. Some don't do any screening other then talking to you. (not smart and you probably should avoid ladies like this(  Some will use your employment info.  If you just pay for a screening site such as P411. Many ladies will take that alone. You are giving your info to one company that is in Canada and they screen you. They will call your employer discreetly. I recommend this route because its better to have your information in one spot instead of with a bunch of different providers though not all ladies take just P411.   There are other ways ladies do it I'm sure. I'm not privy to that info."

Hookers,37bxkx,Escort_addicted,10,Tue May 26 14:27:47 2015 UTC,"She could be completely asymptomatic showing no signs but be infected with every STD as every STD is asymptomatic. With HIV it takes years to start showing signs of infection, and those are opportunistic secondary infections.  Yet if she did have warts or sores all over her pussy, I would have to pass. It never hurts to look at her pussy pretty closely for obvious signs, but lack of signs doesn't mean she is clean - she could be in between an outbreak."
Hookers,37bxkx,thebillstone,7,Tue May 26 17:42:31 2015 UTC,"There are mainly two (I know there are more, but not that common and they're curable) STD's you can catch using a condom: Herpes and HPV.  Regarding HPV, in men it rarely affects them. However, you can still get the Gardasil vaccine being a male (I myself have gotten it), you need to speak to your doctor and tell him you are at special risk of getting it due to sleeping with many new partners often, he will give it to you. I believe it's currently recommended for men until 27 years or later, but you can still get it. People say ""there is no point in getting it as you must have gotten HPV already if you're not a virgin"". This is true, but there are MANY strains of HIV, the new Gardasil vaccine covers 9, so even if you have gotten one of the strains before, it will still cover you from many!  To prevent herpes even when using a condom: check if she has a breakout (although you can still catch it if she doesn't), and use Lifestyles DualProtect Condoms that come with VivaGel, a lubricant that prevents herpes transmission of Herpes and HIV in 99,9% of cases. It is very hard to get, currently they only sell them on Australia and New Zealand but they are getting permissions around the world soon. This is the biggest breakthrough that we have for herpes available for consumers. Several vaccines are being developed even by the same researcher who invented the Gardasil vaccine.  Also, for herpes, avoid as much skin contact as you can (Missionary for example is a position you might want to avoid as there is a lot of skin-contact even using a condom so you could get HPV if she has warts or herpes as well). Also clean the area after the sex (this reduces the chances of you catching herpes).   If condom breaks, do post-exposure prophylaxis for Chlamydia and Gonorrhea and Syphilis with two doses of Azythromicin, and consider getting on PostEP for HIV as well but your chances of getting HIV from unprotected penetrative vaginal sex with an HIV positive woman are slim to non (4 per 10,000 exposures according you the CDC).  Overall the risks are very low if you use condoms. The only sucky non-curable STD you can get without a condom is Herpes nowadays IMO (as HPV barely does anything to men and there is a vaccine).   Avoid street hookers, hire escorts that do it for a living and not out of desperation. They are professionals so they will make sure they are healthy as getting a transmittable STD would end their career and give them bad reviews. Some studies have shown that prostitutes in some part of the world have lower STD rates than young women.   Eat well, exercise, keep your immune system strong! This seems stupid but helps a lot."

Hookers,37bxkx,CourtofOwlz,5,Tue May 26 14:34:27 2015 UTC,"Again. We need a std bot as guys seem obsessed with catching something and assume a bunch of hobbyist are better for advice than doctors or planned parenthood. It's right up there with hookers have looser vaginas b/c of all the sex. Most of this shit should've been covered in grade school, but I guess people are just dumb.   STD prevention is pretty well known. Less physical contact = safer. Knowing ur partners history helps. With sexworkers, you'll never know, so you need to always practice safe sex, especially for intercourse. Use condoms. It ain't rocket science. There's no look or smell test.   The real problem for newbies is the type of girl that you're seeing. If you go slumming for street walkers, clist, or backpage providers and think you're getting a great deal, don't get too excited. Although there are some great providers on backpage, there's also many girls in this game for fast cash, who may lead riskier lifestyles. That $100 bargain comes with more risk. See reputable providers with reviews.   Since std questions seem to come up daily, some of you guys need to realize there's always a risk and you won't know. I get tested quarterly for the big stuff and bi-annually do an 8 panel test. I've done aim testing prior to seeing pornstars. I always use condoms for intercourse with a provider. I do all of this b/c I take my health very seriously.   Sorry to break your heart, but there's no secret handshake to know of someone is clean. Gotta just protect yourself as much as possible."
Hookers,37bxkx,CourtofOwlz,1 point,Tue May 26 15:25:40 2015 UTC,"I also take my health VERY seriously.  I apologize if you seem that this post is  repeat.    I am not asking ""how to I stay safe?"" or ""Do I have an STD omg??!..."" or even...""are you scared for a STD?""   I am asking if the guys here do a preromp look? And if so what they do.  If you think that just because you don't use Backpage you are any less at risk cause you pay more, then you are just as dumb as the fools who go bareback."
Hookers,37bxkx,diplodonkey,2,Tue May 26 16:17:36 2015 UTC,"If you don't feel comfortable for any reason, just walk out. However, if you think there's a look test to know if someone's clean, you are an idiot. Only a doctor and tests can verify a STD.  The likelihood of running into someone with a higher risk lifestyle on backpage is greater than eros, p411, or TER. The cost point to advertise is much lower on bp; thus, many lower priced escorts post there. I made the point that girls looking for fast cash are doing so for a reason. That reason might be altruistic or to fund an higher risk lifestyle. Go to USAsexguide and view the 'real' pics of girls in major cities that are pulled off bp, then come talk to me. They definitely aren't providers paying for their grad degrees. An escort who treats this as her career is more likely concerned about her health, sexually and otherwise. Seasoned well reviewed escorts with limited clients/higher rates are a better bet than buying low. Still a risk, but much less than BP. Sex with anyone new is a risk, period. The myth that sexworkers have a higher incidence of STDs has been proven dubious at best through multiple peer reviewed research papers. Again, you are an idiot if you think some look test will do anything for you."
Hookers,37bxkx,veryfinechick,1 point,Tue May 26 17:17:30 2015 UTC,"Its mostly my kink as I seek out submissive, fetish-friendly providers who role-play, but these days I start my sessions out by giving the girl a physical... rubber gloves, thermometer, pen light. I have them open their mouth, lift up their tongue, then I have them bend over and do the same for each orifice. As I said, the medical thing is my kink, and a cursory, unskilled examination does nothing for anything asymptomatic, but it gives you a really good understanding of her hygiene and self-care. If you find sores, unusual discharge, or foul odors you can move on as you diplomatically so choose. Now maybe poking and prodding a naked, young woman isn't your thing, and maybe its really wont be her thing. But at least I also know that a provider that participates in this kind of play is not worried about what I'll find. So try it out. You might enjoy it and you might get a little piece of mind."

There should really be a bot that points people to an std sub, so they can get a 6th grade sexual health tutorial.   The risk of catching anything from a bbbj is minimal. It's more likely to get a cold sore from kissing than anything from just mouth interaction.   Almost any reputable escort does bbbj. The reason. Pull out a rubber glove, wrap a banana around it, and suck on it for 15 minutes 5 times a day. It's not pleasurable. Guys expect bjs at every session. I've rarely met a reviewed provider that did not perform bbbj and had 0 issues.   Now full inter course is another story and should always be wrapped up."

It's located next to the Brussels North (Noord/Nord) train station primarily on Rue d'Aerschot. Like other red light districts, you walk down the street and observe the girls through windows. When you find one that captures your fancy, you just approach them and inquire. Standard price for a suck and fuck for 15/20 minutes is €40 and you can pay for extras such as additional time, additional positions, anal and so on. Regular police presence which means that it's safe and well regulated. I was there in the early morning, around 9 or so and there were approximately 40 girls working, most were young and fit, not a lot of ethnic variety as the majority of the girls come from eastern Europe.

Should a 70 year old not fuck an escort? The problem with the hobbyist age debate is that it's wrapped up in idiotic logic that all guys seeing escorts can't get laid. However at 18 there's just tons of free, young pussy.   nonsense. No, seeing an escort is about having fun and paying for a service. If an 18 year old does his homework and is respectful, clean, and follows the provider's requests, why the fuck not dive in.   I'm a fundamental believer that people go through life feeling shame b/c assholes don't want them to be happy. I don't know the OP, but he wants to see a courtesan. Who am I to judge him?    OP, try Eros guide and TER to get an idea of the type of girl u like. I'd start there and search this sub as tons of questions have been answered."

Do a search for price range and ethnicity.   Most of the ladies that are set up in these places are with an agency of sorts. Find the agency/madame, and if you can pass what ever screening they/she wants you'll get a date.  Certainly you can find them doing a web search but how would you know if they are legit or not?"

I carefully researched and went to the address of a place reported to deal with foreigners.  A nice man took me in, show me some photos from a book (faces blurred out).  I picked one based on what little info I had to go on.  Another dude walked me around the corner and down the street so a (different) soapie and I chilled until the girl came down.  She was not remotely like the picture; at least thirty pounds overweight.  I resigned myself to it and went upstairs with her.  The whole thing was awkward.  She kept giggling inappropriately.  She did all the right things but there was nothing amazing about it.  Freaking expensive, too.  I've since looked into Tokyo escorts and there are some extremely hot ones for the same price that I'm fairly sure would give a much better experience."

She could well be GFE, but one of the reviews I read said no kissing which to me would make it non-gfe. To me GFE mean kissing and condomless oral (bbbj)   Not all escorts are GFE. It pays to have VIP on TER so you can see what other guys have said about her services. You may really like a certain act and it might be a deal breaker for you. Don't you want to know?  There are other review sites that may well be better for your area. (I already forgot where you are). You should check around and see which would be best for you.  Every act/service is always YMMV. I've seen ladies that have reviews  that say that there was a lot of making out and kissing and I've been mostly rejected on my attempts. It isn't me, it isn't my breath, I'm seriously anal about my breath and always use mouthwash in the car and pop a few mints on the way in. So I can only assume she didn't want to kiss me seriously or the other review is full of shit. Either is possible. It wasn't a big deal, the rest the date was great. Like I was saying, its all YMMV when it comes to the encounter. I never make assumptions and just roll with what is offered.  It needs to be repeated, if you see well reviewed ladies in 4 and 5 star hotels you have about 0% chance of running into LE and 90%+ of have a very good/great time. I do the above, and I've never had a bad date. Some average, most above average to great. There is a lot of truth in.. you get what you pay for. Certainly you can find bargains trolling BP, but the your odds of trouble are greatly increased."

Hookers,36iohi,Daty_Dato,2,Tue May 19 23:56:42 2015 UTC,The Erotic Review has tons of negative reviews.  I am curious to know where he read all the positive reviews?   But you are right... plenty of providers write their own reviews.
Hookers,36iohi,malibijones,1 point,Fri May 22 20:32:04 2015 UTC,"TER approves reviews that are formatted correctly. I've never had them reject a review of mine that was entered correctly. I've never heard, and I frequent a number of the boards including the RO board, anyone complaining about it.  Yes some reviews are fakes probably less then 2%.  There is risk in seeing ladies with few reviews. I don't do it. I'm comfortable waiting for a lengthy track record to flesh out their real menu and real scores.   Know this, a 9 looks score on TER is more like a 7.5 RL facially. Even the majority of top ladies aren't model material. The scores are inflated in many cases. Excluding face, the top ladies almost all have smoking hot bodies.  Some of the reasons for inflated scores are understandable. Experienced guys don't like slamming experienced providers and simply don't write a review or just put a ""good enough"" score to get by.  Do you want to be the guy who scores a lady 7/7 when all her other scores are 9/9?  There will often be a backlash if it becomes a habit. After all we want dates with other ""high end"" ladies and consistently low or average scores with lead to you getting rejected. It isn't fair or right but its a fact. Some providers do offer discounts or extras for better scores, hard to argue with those getting those extras for better scores. After all this is a very selfish game.   If you are so fixated on a certain look or think that they actually look exactly like their best pictures you'll be disappointed. The pictures are going to show their best features, just know if they aren't showing something such as their behind, its probably not her best feature.    Personally I don't mind average looking ladies facially as long as their performance is good/great. Honestly, the best looking ladies I've seen have been mostly forgettable between the sheets. Usually its a function of age, they simply don't have the experience or passion."

Its only money, you don't need the cops called. (see warren sapp)  I always leave the envelope in the bathroom for outcalls. If they are going to run out on me, I want them to have clear access to the door. I'm surprised she'd bolt with the cash if she's well reviewed though it certainly isn't the first time a well reviewed lady did this.. You should drop dime on her on all the review sites and should here as well.   I mostly see ladies that have a lot of experience and a lot of reviews. (50 or more) I prefer ladies in that 25-35 age range. They still look good and really know how to #$$%."
Hookers,36jet0,Defeaningast,8,Tue May 19 20:45:44 2015 UTC,"Legit hotels don't offer hourly rates and I don't think you can even rent a room. 21 is probably the cut off.  If you are in a hourly rate type of place, you won't get a reviewed lady to come see you, let alone they aren't going to want to see someone your age.   Maybe try tinder..."

Find a nice girl at your school, work or neighborhood, start talking to her and take things from there.  Sure, people have had assignations at motels since motels were invented.  A high-end escort will probably refuse to come to a low-end motel though.  And a higher end chain motel/hotel will not look kindly on sex workers or clients who are indiscreet.  If 100 bucks for a hotel rooms is too much for you then this whole ""hobby"" is too expensive for you.  Don't waste your hard-earned money.  Go back and read #1.   People check out of hotels soon for all kinds of reasons, including they just finished having sex.  Hotels staff know this and don't care.  Usually, you pay in advance so you don't even need to go back to the counter to check out.   Hotels are not going to tell you ""Hey, get back in that room, you can't check out after only 2 hours.""  They are just going to check you out and make up the room again to rent to someone else.  Some motels have a short-term package or hourly rates.  Not that many because a lot of municipalities only allow room rentals by the night.  Hint: It is almost always cheaper to book a hotel online than to just walk in.  And it doesn't take but a few minutes to book a hotel online."

Hookers,36gvs8,USAthrowawy,7,Tue May 19 08:14:01 2015 UTC,"Except from the escort's perspective, you've now wasted her time, lost her money she spent getting there and back and potentially she's missed out on seeing genuine clients she's said no to because you'd already booked the time slot. If you booked through an agency, expect them to blacklist you. Agency or independent, your details are likely to now be listed on various forums as a timewaster. Pay a cancellation fee to at least cover her travel costs. And avoid these situations by checking her reviews eg on TER, saying when you book that if she doesn't look like her pics, you'll want to cancel and leave your own reviews."
Hookers,36gvs8,AussieMaleEscort,3,Tue May 19 09:58:09 2015 UTC,"Be straight up about it, pay for her cab and send her away. If anything she will now that you wont be into it both will have a bad time, might as well leave"

If she doesn't look like the pics, you're not feeling it, or the situations way to shady, then just say, 'i'm not feeling it.'  I rarely, if ever, do outcalls to my location (hotel or otherwise) unless it's a random city that has more of an outcall culture. If you are in the game long enough, then you'll probably fuck a couple escorts who were not up to your standards. However, if it's a situation that you don't like, just be a stern and ask her to go before letting her inside."

However, be warned that you have wasted her time.  Time is money to us.  You may be labled as a time waster., and other providers will be hesitant to book with you in the future.

Hookers,36g1gk,im_a_throwawayy,13,Tue May 19 02:37:42 2015 UTC,"This is a cash business. If anyone asks for anything other than cash, tell them no. You pay for what you get. You learned a lesson today. A reputable provider with reviews would most likely not pull this scam.  You're probably fine. It was most likely piddly shit money we're talking about. These scammers aren't doing it for a living. It's day to day money for whatever vices they need to fill. Only people with inordinate amount of time run hustles like this as the success ratios are low and take constant txts. Law enforcement ain't going to get involved one way or another. Trust me, last thing this girl will do is go to the police about a rape case. It's not a simple accusation claim. She has to give details, get a rape kit, and they will ask her tons of questions.

Hookers,36db1c,m_parry,13,Mon May 18 13:58:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly, think about this: the fact that she called you for an off the books transaction should tell you she doesn't WANT to be paid for it, that she actually likes you and wanted to spend time with you. If you really feel guilty about it, ask in an ""I'm not sure what to do here"" sort of way. It looks to me like she gave you a gift. To pay for it would cheapen it and may even be taken as an insult."
Hookers,36db1c,Becolt,6,Mon May 18 14:37:13 2015 UTC,"Caveat emptor. If she ain't business about the sessions, I'd take the freebie and find another provider. Girls like this can lead to drama."
Hookers,36db1c,CourtofOwlz,3,Mon May 18 15:10:17 2015 UTC,"I was thinking exactly what this guy said. She's already got drama attached to her. Between the ex (if she mentioned him or the divorce, he's might still be around) and the ""bad john"", I'd stay away."
Hookers,36db1c,cp9406,2,Mon May 18 15:52:59 2015 UTC,Well if you must keep it a business transaction you probably did the right thing though I'd probably have just accepted the freebie and scheduled her in the future if you wanted to see her. When you schedule you pay when she calls you don't.  Good luck with that.
Hookers,36db1c,Daty_Dato,2,Mon May 18 14:23:25 2015 UTC,"so I've hooked up with this girl a few more times. usually spending the night. unlike a paid session, there is no expectation of sex or particular acts. we usually talk and hang out before we do anything. she refuses my money. there's been a little drama but overall she's pretty chill. she likes me and i like her. part of it is that she's just gorgeous, and the sex is just amazing, but another is that I just like her as a person. she entered the profession out of sheer necessity, and honestly, she touched me with her vulnerability and sense of humor. i'm not sure where this is going, but the last thing I want to do is hurt her.  she's still providing and despite not advertising has a couple of rich regulars who book overnights and week long trips. i'm not going to ask her to stop...I would be asshole if I did."

Just like strip clubs, you pay, they hang out and talk with you, get  little motion going, maybe a little extra, but at the end of the day, it's just another shift for them, and they are doing it to make money."
Hookers,36d1ce,iamjosecanseco,3,Mon May 18 19:11:01 2015 UTC,"1) dont stick with just one, I tried that like a year ago, saw her like 10 times, I realized I was falling hard, so I never called her again (it was really though, but I had to)  2) realize (and keep reminding yourself) that those cute little mesages she sends you, those kind and intimate words she says and how she ""only cums with you"" is probably her routine with other 20 guys, that literally her job, happy customers, more tips.   3) recomend her to other hobist, this might be just me, but just the thought of someone else paying to fuck her keeps me centered and reminds me shes only for the business, hell, give her some advertisement, she might honestly like that"

Hookers,36d1ce,TheOldestProfession,2,Mon May 18 14:05:03 2015 UTC,"Of course, I fell for my current ATF. She's incredible in bed, amazingly gorgeous, incredibly intelligent, and completely out of my league.   But what keeps me grounded and able to control my desires is the fact that this is a business transaction that satisfies a part of me that I need satisfied. It does not satisfy everything I am looking for, but to me, that is fine. It's good to remember the transactional nature of your relationship with your provider, and to remind yourself that she is also viewing it in the same way. She didn't sign up for this job to find love, she signed up for this job to make some cash money.  There are situations where two people fall for each other though, but that is rare.   My advice is to remind yourself that you are acting out a role in a fantasy movie. You are playing your part, she is playing hers. If you want love and affection you have to work at it, not throw money at it."
Hookers,36d1ce,CourtofOwlz,2,Mon May 18 22:29:40 2015 UTC,"Naw, guys fall for girls all the time. It's ill advised, but you'll see guys post about their atf (all time faves). If you are in the game long term, you treat it like a business if you want to have the most fun.   Also, you never really know the true person behind the provider. It's a persona she puts on for your session. Guys fall in love with that persona and no woman is 'on' all the time. She's most likely a regular woman who is good at the art of seduction. It's a magic trick. If you see behind the curtain, you're probably going to become jaded pretty quickly."
Hookers,36d1ce,Daty_Dato,1 point,Mon May 18 13:52:18 2015 UTC,"Its business but sometimes emotions come into play. Best to avoid it. In rare cases, some guys end up marrying hookers but like I said its really rare. I had one ATF, she retired to soon, (she was a lot of guys ATF) I had weird thoughts but the truth is behind the mask, it isn't always all that pretty of a picture. Owlz, spelled it out perfectly.  I've always felt that part of the donation is so that I can leave without regret. I can't be more then a john, and while I'm more then happy to make it a good ""date"", that's all it is. A date. No strings. Don't call me, I'll call you type of thing."
Hookers,36d1ce,archangelle_dworkin,2,Mon May 18 14:28:29 2015 UTC,"Don't see just one provider - find a few that you really like, so you won't only have good experiences with one person and think that they must be special. Lots of women can make you feel pretty good.    Don't let yourself daydream about possibilities.  Remember that you are seeing her work personality - just like you probably only show a limited part of your personality to the people you see at work, and you are probably nicer and more polite to some people at work than you really want to be (bosses and customers, perhaps), she is doing that too. In her real life, she might be bitchy & whiny & difficult, but she's not going to show that to you as a client, that's not what you're paying for."
Hookers,36d1ce,reaper555,1 point,Mon May 18 15:35:16 2015 UTC,"The moment you start developing feelings. Start seeing another provider. And also keep in mind how many other clients emptied there cum in her mouth and pussy before she sat down started talking to you. Not to mention orgies, threesomes and who knows what else. The job of the escort is to hook you by playing with your emotions. It's like a sales rep - they pretend to like you, they smile, but in the end they are looking for the sale. I'll admit I've developed some feelings for my SP that I see monthly but I'm always suspicious of everything she says. And I just keep in mind that it's all a game and we are here to fun."
Hookers,36bmoz,kappa_322_420,3,Mon May 18 01:50:58 2015 UTC,"Best way I have found is to buy a throw away credit card at Walmart or a grocery store.  You pay a fee to put money on it, and it maintains your anonymity.  VISA and AMEX both have prepaid products.  PayPal ultimately links back to your real identity, so I would avoid using it if discretion is an issue.  P411 will also accept a money order, there is just a delay in your service until they receive and post it."

The type I use is called Vanilla Visa or Vanilla Mastercard.  There is an activation fee of several dollars above the face value of the card.  Be sure to pay with cash.  Once you buy the card, you scratch off the code on the back and then go to Vanilla's website and log in with the code.  There, you can add a zip code to be used as a billing address for online transactions.  Enter a zip code, then when you enter the cc information, supply a fake address that has the same zip code as what you entered on the website."

Hookers,36a2px,Daty_Dato,3,Sun May 17 17:57:23 2015 UTC,"Actually, a lot of them simply want to make money and return to their home country.  Many do six month stints in and out of the sex industry.  It's known as migratory sex work, although rescue groups might call it human trafficking.   If someone wants to become a citizen, there are easier and more straightforward avenues available for that.   And yeah, by the nature of this business, many are very good at packing an emotional experience into an hour long session.  It is real...for that hour."
Hookers,36a2px,TTTT27,9,Sun May 17 22:27:41 2015 UTC,"You're not crazy, you're maybe just a tiny bit gullible? A lot of the SE escorts are able to have multiple boyfriends who pay them well to stay out of the escort business and they still escort when their boyfriends are out of the country. Escorting in say Thailand doesn't have the same social stigma that is does in the west so they can keep up a normal lifestyle while still doing the nasty for money.   Then again, you could be a decent dude and they fall in love with you. We are all people in the end."

It's entertaining and funny and sad at the same time hearing these guys have false love and feelings for these girls.  It's almost a psychological issue with these guys and how they create these relationships and feelings in their head and then feel they need to be the all mighty soap boxer for them.  They're prostitutes and we're johns, hobbyists etc.  That's it.  Don't let yourself get mind fucked and lose sight of what you're really doing and there for."

Hookers,36a2px,I_bang_ladyboys,1 point,Tue May 19 17:37:56 2015 UTC,"In a lot of cases this is true, but I'm not sure it is in 100%.  I've seen plenty of anecdotal reports that marriages between prostitutes and their Western clients in Thailand or the Philippines have at least as much success as marriages between ""good girl"" locals and Western guys.  For example:  www.thaivisa.com/forum/topic/277776-do-you-have-a-succesfull-marriage-to-a-bar-girl/  www.thaivisa.com/forum/topic/269638-mini-survey-did-you-marry-a-thai-bar-girl-why/  I've also heard plenty of horror stories, the farang husband who ""commits suicide"" by falling off a balcony is a cliché here. It pays to be careful, I have heard many cases of girls who milk their husbands of all their money and then dumping them when done. I've also been mid-bang with a girl many times when they have taken phone calls from their ""boyfriend"". I actually find that hilarious, I'll continue quietly plowing away while they try to have a lovey dovey conversation with them.  Note though that while with some girls in this situation they'll laugh about the guy when they put the phone down and are clearly just milking him, in others the girl honestly seemed to have a genuine concern, interest and even love for him. I'm just a client paying them 500B for short time but they honestly spoke to me with genuine respect about the boyfriend.   They keep working because they have to, to put money on the table, but it doesn't necessarily mean that they don't care about the guy. I have helped girls I was banging fill out visa applications to go visit their foreign boyfriend, and I've seen some genuinely upset about something that happened in their relationship with this guy. Some girls showed me photos of the guy and their travels together, they seemed really proud of him.   Money is certainly a motivator in this, but that's the case in general for marriage in Asia. Yes they may marry you for money but that doesn't necessarily mean the marriage won't work out.  I've never personally really developed strong feelings for any of the girls I've fucked here, whether whores or regular girls. Some girls however seem to have done so for me... Whether that is all an act or not I really don't know but it wasn't reciprocated. And I know the emphasis is on your being able to financially support them, but I have been with girls who honestly really wanted a man to take them out, they didn't like what they were doing at all.   I have on occasion had a hooker refuse money, no I go with you for free, but learned it's better to always pay, do it for free and they can start acting like your girlfriend and feeling entitled to complain when you want to go bang their friends. ""Free"" if they are a bar girl is often a long term investment  for them... They think they'll get the investment back down the road if you actually marry them.  Personally I would never marry or even get seriously involved with one of these girls because you really never can know for sure. But it's not the case that 100% of the time that there isn't genuine affection there."

And as noted, they are almost always older, I've seen 6 or 7 (guessing) ""K"" girl types and only one was under 30. I think. A few pushing 40 but still in fantastic shape.

Hookers,365s82,8015f1d1fd4,3,Sat May 16 12:26:41 2015 UTC,"I honestly think you are completely insane to be thinking of spending 5-20k+ on this, but it's your money. It's possible to have a threesome with two hot 18 year olds for $20-30, I do so regularly, but if you don't like Asians yes it is going to get more expensive. Fortunately I massively prefer Asians and happen to live in Asia so this all works out.  A factor to consider here is the performance, it is rarely guaranteed and it can range from woeful to fantastic. I think a better strategy than looking to spend 5-20k+ on this is simply to spend LESS money on each individual encounter and go have a whole load of threesomes, I have spent less than that IN MY LIFE and have slept with thousands of women including plenty of threesomes (the most recent 15 minutes ago) and the occasional foursome.  If you stake 5-20k on two particular girls and it just doesn't work out, you are going to be out 5-20k for what ended up not being a great experience. Spread that over 100 girls and it is pretty much guaranteed that at least SOME of them are going to end up being memorable.  A girl can be as hot and young as you like but if she's lying there like a starfish and doesn't want to get on top it's still going to be crap. Don't underestimate this."
Hookers,365s82,I_bang_ladyboys,1 point,Sun May 17 14:45:05 2015 UTC,"I'm aware I could probably do this more cheaply - almost all of the cost is going to be minimizing risk around not using condoms.  I don't know of a better way to go about that, maybe there is?  Still, $20k is like... a new Ford Fiesta?  My financial planning can accommodate that for a meaningful personal goal.  It's not like I'm dropping half a million to go shoot some poor creature in Africa or whatever other life experiences people set out to have."
Hookers,365s82,I_bang_ladyboys,5,Sun May 17 14:55:23 2015 UTC,"You can minimise the risk of not using condoms (which I don't think is advisable, but if you are determined lets go with that) by making sure you are on Truvada for a period before and after your adventure. That isn't going to be very expensive. Protip: just tell the doctor you are gay or bisexual and you will probably have an easier time of getting it prescribed for you.  All your stuff about testing the girls and waiting a month or whatever is pointless as at the end of the day testing only tells you that they definitely didn't have HIV six months ago, almost definitely didn't have it three months ago and probably didn't have it one month ago.  There is no way you are going to be able to guarantee that a hooker is not out turning other tricks in the month between your testing and actually consumating the deed unless you lock her up which I presume isn't going to be part of the deal. I have been fucking girls who mid-coitus take phone calls from their ""boyfriends"". And bear in mind that HIV is overwhelmingly most infectious immediately after initial infection, half of all transmission occurs in this period by people who don't know they are infected.  If you absolutely insist on the no condom thing, which again I don't recommend, just make sure you are on Truvada and go for it. The risk in the West for female to male transmission through vaginal sex is 1 in 2500 IF the woman is actually positive, so make that 1 in 1250 as you'll be banging two girls, divide that by 0.6% for the US prevalence rate, multiply it by two (complete guess, but that's about the increase in risk where I'm from for the higher end) for being a sex worker, divide by the 90% (possibly more) reduction in risk from Truvada and I've had a bit too much to drink to properly calculate all this right now but it is almost certainly 1 in several million.  You don't need to spend several thousand over this.  Every other STD is either negligible or curable, HIV is the one you need to be concerned about. Hepatitis B is the next most serious but I presume you would be vaccinated for that.  The point is you are overthinking this with no practical experience. I'd suggest you just plow in to the experience of hookers in general, cheaper paid threesomes, using condoms, and then if you still want to move on to this fantasy later you can do so with more actual knowledge of what is involved. If you literally can't get it up with a condom, honestly, Viagra. It will be UP.  For what it's worth, my first threesome, which occured very soon after the first time I paid for sex, was absolutely and utterly incredibly bad. Really really just terrible. The girls were just incredibly not into it to the point I really considered swearing off this forever. My second however was mindblowing. Honestly, spread your money about a bit more rather than pegging it all on this one fantasy, the reality could fall very short and then you'll be regretting you spent thousands on it."

I really appreciate your advice and experience, and you taking the time to share them with me.  I'm sure you're completely on point.   For what it's worth, my first threesome...  was absolutely and utterly incredibly bad   Mine too, though not paid sex.  Couldn't keep it up because of the condom, awkwardness, hurt feelings, regret, lost opportunities, disappointment.  Really not good.  Such a letdown after the optimism and emotional investment leading up to it.  Still, I would like to get this right, on my own terms.   If you literally can't get it up with a condom, honestly, Viagra. It will be UP.   This doesn't apply for reasons I don't care to get into, but I'm sure it's good advice in general.  To me, it's a question of doing this or not, if it can't be done I can live with that: ""I'll probably never be a billionaire, I'll probably never have the sexual experience I want, oh well.""  I think I'll take your advice on getting some experience first.  I am really not at all interested in sex with condoms, but I could get into hiring providers to do something else - maybe to have them pose nude and do figure drawing, or play naked video games or something?  Other posters in this sub have mentioned the Sugar Daddy thing, which seems all round better suited to what I want.  You make a good point about how I may be unlucky in the girls I find, that they may not be very sexually compatible or enthusiastic, but that's OK, I wouldn't be too unhappy with that.  Perhaps some of the dissonance here is that I'm asking a goal oriented question in a lifestyle oriented sub.  I am not looking for a hobby, this is something I want to do right, one time.  You all have been very helpful and patient with me, I realise I'm going against the grain with my requirements.  I'm not glibly dismissing the health risk, my largest concern would be harming others - if I harm myself going after what I want then so be it.  I will be mindful of what you said about testing when discussing this with a doc.  I think girls from the SeekingArrangement site are less likely to be seeing hundreds of Johns, so potential exposure would be from their ordinary sex life and any other sugar daddies they maintain.  With all other precautions that seems manageable from a health perspective.    Maybe foolish, but I live a fairly monkish existence this past decade, I don't take risks or indulge myself much.  I have to wonder what I'm working so hard for.  What is it worth and what do I really want?  I think I know."

Or blowjobs. Your HIV risk from that is near zero, I'm not sure if a case has ever been recorded. I have got gonorrhea that way, but that's curable. And that was once in over one thousand blowjobs. And your risk is lower if you are strictly heterosexual, which I am very much not, many of my STDs have come from interactions with penises.   Two girls going down on you is one of the best parts of a threesome IMO and very very low risk. In fact probably my #1 is being blown by one girl while being kissed by the other, for some reason that is just fantastic. Also: having one girl jack you off into the other girl's mouth. This is all negligible STD risk. Give it a go."

Hookers,365s82,I_bang_ladyboys,2,Sun May 17 18:56:38 2015 UTC,"It's important to be aware of the STD/HIV risks but honestly most people overplay them and get far too worried about it. There are specific things that are more risky but there are also things that are virtually zero risk. And getting a blowjob from one, two or an entire netball team of girls is one of those things. And with 5-20k you could easily have the whole netball team."

It's a business transaction and both of your health ain't worth your failed logic. Also, saying condoms aren't the last word on safe sex is like saying seat belts don't save lives, thus I won't wear one. You're fine, until you get into an accident, then you're fucked.

I'm careful, have few partners and am regularly tested, I don't pick up girls at bars.  I won't be a risk to anyone's health.  As for risk to myself, I'm looking to set things up so that it's manageable and minimized - prophylactic ARV therapy and repeated screening have been shown to work well by the porn industry and others.  This is not something I plan to make a habit of, and I can accept that it might kill me - a risk that's probably comparable to scuba or skydiving.   If I meet a provider or escort that insinuates I don't wrap up for sex, then I won't see them. If they're barebacking for you, then they're doing it for everyone.

Hookers,365s82,shamelessnameless,2,Sun May 17 13:47:31 2015 UTC,I do think forgoing condoms with sex workers is very very foolhardy but you are right that it is very unlikely to kill you. Particularly not if you actually plan to take Truvada around the period that you do this.  I've only not worn a condom outside of a monogamous LTR once due to being drunk and horny and I massively regretted it in the morning. I'm also pretty sure the girl was positive from talking to her friends. But touch wood I probably didn't get it (last test was clear but not completely out of the woods yet).

Hookers,365s82,archangelle_dworkin,2,Sun May 17 15:23:09 2015 UTC,From my understanding Truvada on its own for PrEP usually doesn't have major side effects. PEP or actual treatment usually involves multiple drugs with a higher risk of side effects.  I have been recommended Truvada myself by a doctor after I related my history but I'm not 100% on whether he was just trying to scare me straight.

Hookers,35w59a,overnighttttttttttt,3,Thu May 14 00:30:57 2015 UTC,"I've done a couple.  Wish I could do more- but they are pricey for the client.  I have a weeknight and weekend rate; since I have a day job my weeknight rate is a lot more expensive.  I make sure that we meet for one regular (short) session first to make sure we click.    I'll either do a 10pm-10am with no dinner and breakfast (that I ask him what he wants and I make it).  Or 8pm-8am with dinner (out at a restaurant, or take out and a movie at home).  Just depends on schedules and what kind of experience he wants.   Make sure you are both on the same page re the sleeping schedule.  If you want to wake her up every hour to have sex, make sure she knows.    you can pm me if you have more specific questions about rates."
Hookers,35w59a,maudlin-for-autumn,3,Thu May 14 18:12:57 2015 UTC,They're usually very expensive.  $800 or more is what I typically see.  For that kind of money you hire 2 or 3 girls at the same time.  I would do that over paying to sleep next to someone in every situation I can imagine.
Hookers,35w59a,ILikeTheHobby,2,Thu May 14 20:20:22 2015 UTC,"Well, every girl has her own rates and rules for these sorts of things, so you will have to inquire with the particular provider you are interested in. I reccommend it being someone you have seen before for a multi-hour.  By the end of your initial meeting you should be able to discuss expectations of both parties :) Good luck!"

Hookers,35w59a,blndcavefsh,4,Thu May 14 07:34:22 2015 UTC,After the fuck I'm usually sort of done   I feel the same way sometimes.  But an overnight is usually when a guy is either a) exceptionally lonely or b) exceptionally horny.  Sometimes a and b.
Hookers,35w59a,maudlin-for-autumn,1 point,Thu May 14 18:15:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure, longest appointment I've ever done was a multiple hour dinner and that was only once. I recently got a large amount of spending cash and won't be booking any more appointments after this one so I thought it might be fun to go out with a bang."
Hookers,35w59a,TheOldestProfession,3,Thu May 14 17:52:55 2015 UTC,"Don't do it man. Stretch it out over multiple longer appointments. I like overnights, but the best appointments are around 4 to 5 hours long. You get to chat, maybe drink a little, do the multiple pop thing, then head home all sexed up and happy."
Hookers,35w59a,anonyboo,2,Thu May 14 18:21:33 2015 UTC,"I don't really think of an overnight as one constant appointment - four to five hours, then snuggles and sleep, then two or three hours in the morning. Just, y'know, don't harass me in the middle of the night when I'm trying to sleep."
Hookers,35w59a,analfuck,1 point,Sat May 16 14:32:56 2015 UTC,I was thinking of doing that. But I really am going to be done with participating in these kind of activities after this appointment. Since I have never done an overnight before and am willing to spend money thought it might be interesting.
Hookers,35w59a,analfuck,1 point,Thu May 14 20:01:48 2015 UTC,Most for an overnight seem to be in the 1500 buck range. but really the best deal would be a nice dinner then take her home for some romping but after that why keep her on unless you are actually interested in her.
Hookers,35w59a,analfuck,1 point,Thu May 14 14:02:25 2015 UTC,"I have discussed the appointment with the provider and several things are included in the overnight, like going to dinner along with multiple other places plus some extra things included on the activities menu.  It's not that i'm interested in her rather that I am not going to be seeing any providers again after this appointment. I have been seeing this particular provider for several years now and I guess its my way of saying goodbye and thanks for everything.  The price quoted was about 8 times her hourly rate, and she mentioned the overnight includes about 12-14 hours. But like I said she included several things that might typically cost extra.  Does this seem like a fair quote?"
Hookers,35w59a,Daty_Dato,3,Thu May 14 17:49:44 2015 UTC,"I think so, however, if you have been going to her all those years and she knows that this will be the last time I would think she would be more supporting and giving you a really great deal. Seems like business as usual. If it was me I would split that money up between 8 hookers and really finish up with a bang."
Hookers,35w59a,slightlytainted,1 point,Fri May 15 14:13:52 2015 UTC,I think I would actually split it up or do several hours instead but I do not have the time to fit that into my schedule.  Around what time do overnight appointments typically begin? How much actual sleeping is usually involved?
Hookers,35w59a,iamjosecanseco,1 point,Fri May 15 19:33:35 2015 UTC,Most should start around dinner with you picking them up or them being dropped off where you want. Then they will usually leave after breakfast. Sex is there but you will still sleep. you are not John Holmes or Peter North and even they have to sleep.

Escorts use the two call & references.  Both are fine.  I'd just make sure that whatever your provider of choice is that you've gotten some reviews on them.  No trying random providers on backpage."

Hookers,35pqni,thebillstone,1 point,Wed May 13 16:14:33 2015 UTC,"If he kept his mouth shut, the arrest wouldn't lead to a conviction, but they don't need a real reason to arrest you. They can just make some shit up, drag you in and hope you rat yourself out.  Silence makes no mistakes."

I imagine people who've never been arrested or delt with police would confess pretty easily thinking they'll get out of jail if they do confess.   They could also question the escort, and  if she confesses that the two of you had sex, it might be a little difficult to plead not guilty."

You can even use fake info, they have self help sections. dozens of pages full of the information you seek.   If you see well reviewed ladies at 4 and 5 star hotels the odds are close to 0 its LE. Prevent STD's. 100% don't do it., short of that, you need to weigh the risks of each act you/she'll(?) perform but always where a condom for intercourse/anal. How much info you are comfortable giving is up. For some none, for others all. Fake email and burner phone is standard practices."
Hookers,35l0um,Daty_Dato,1 point,Mon May 11 11:53:10 2015 UTC,"burner phone   Either that or a second number on your smartphone using Google Voice (or similar).  Some people, me included, think that having a second phone is a bigger risk than having an app buried in your regular phone."
Hookers,35l0um,ILikeTheHobby,3,Tue May 12 16:04:15 2015 UTC,"AFAX or Adultfax is a good one too.    Prepaid phones are good.  Or google voice, however, that is still somehow connected to you via your phone and accounts.  I'd go with the pre-paid.  Pay in cash and you're all set.  Just research around and try the different sites.  Sometimes it helps to use multiple sites and see if things match up."
Hookers,35l0um,livingstonocean,2,Mon May 11 17:51:23 2015 UTC,"I would suggest a combination of TER and P411.  Stick to the well reviewed ladies that offer either private in call or upscale hotel and all should be fine.  On P411, you can search for newbie friendly providers (those that will see you without references).   There is no way to prevent some diseases.  Best you can do is be cautious.  Look for obvious sores.  If anything doesn't appear right, eject.  Personally, I have never had a problem with this.  Always wear a rain coat. It took some planning, but I got in without providing any personal information or showing any ID.  I did join P411 very early on.  Personally, I have never wanted any of my RL info floating around this scene. I have a throw away email and a Google voice account that I use for my hobby playtime.  I would never provide my RL info in the hobby unless I knew the lady well and there was a very compelling reason to do so."
Hookers,35l0um,justanotherhobbyist,1 point,Mon May 11 16:30:47 2015 UTC,"Well... There's nothing you can do about STD's.  You can get them by wearing a condom or not.  Some are a lot harder to get than others.  A lot of them require the ""perfect storm"" so to say.  I'm a fan of Adultfax as well, but TER has a lot as well.  Verifying, there 's p411.    Honestly, the only one you can rely on is yourself.  Rely on your gut.  Doesn't feel right??? Then move on to the next.  There's a bunch out there."

Also, Google Image search is your friend. If you're using Google Chrome you can right click an image and search for that photo online. It's a good way to check if an EM posting (or any other posting) is a fake. If you see their photos on porn sites or on forums from a ways back it's most likely a fake ad.   Anyway, definitely use TER."
Hookers,35cnou,delraynightrain,4,Sat May 9 10:30:55 2015 UTC,"The problem with TER is that the review system (both the points and the ability to get a review to even post) is that it encourages clients to write exaggerated descriptions of sessions; so while you can take the existence of a review and its general tone as an indication about what you can expect from a provider, the specific description of sex acts, etc., may be overstated or unrealistic.   You may be able to get a better answer about a review site if you tell us what general area (city/state) you're in - it seems like many areas have a dominant local board where all the action is."
Hookers,35cnou,archangelle_dworkin,3,Sat May 9 22:02:59 2015 UTC,"This problem happens because TER moderators made it obligatory to write long reviews. The first time I tried to write a short text like ""we went to bedroom, went from position to position, talked a little and finished the session"". My review was unapproved and they said that I should write step by step details of all sexual acts. So it goes, that's why a lot of reviews look like sexy tales."

Less sleazy and more convenient for me to see someone in the serviced apartments which seem to almost only exist to house escorts and business travellers.    I don't find the high end girls much better than any others. What you pay is absolutely no determination of the quality of service you will receive or the looks of the girl.  You really have to take some gambles until you hit on a winner.  Most service is decent but some ladies go above and beyond.  brisbane backpage com is a good place to start if you're looking for cheap and easy thrills.  Avoid the Asians around Kangaroo Point with the obvious fake photos in the ads.  You definitely will not get what you see.  You'll find the high end girls on private girls if you like paying double for the silicon models.  If you're into body slides, then the Thai girls in fortitude valley are the best bet.  Many of the legit looking massage shops also do a simple rub and tug for a $20 - $50 tip.  You can identify these shops because the massage is done only covered by a towel, in a private room and the girl will usually give you a bit of a tackle tickle during the massage if she's up for it and then it's up to you to ask.  Have fun.  Outside of the developing world, Australia is one of the best places to be a sex crazed pervert."

Hookers,35c7qs,delraynightrain,-1,Wed May 13 23:57:46 2015 UTC,"Verification isn't really a standardized process. Some providers ask for your TER profile name and that's it. Others just ask for your full name and phone number. It varies. That said, if they don't do some sort of verification that's a bit sketchy but feel free to ask them to do it. Mind you, you're the one who's asking for the service so be comfortable with making reasonable requests.  $1000 for 2 hours could be a bit high. It really depends on what will happen. For someone with her looks, I'd say go for it, but the lack of TER reviews is a bit off-putting. Maybe she hasn't been active recently? You should ask her. Never hurts to ask more questions."

As with marijuana legalization, there needs to be broad consensus that the illegality isn't working and that there is a better way.  Which shouldn't be too hard, seeing as half the world doesn't criminalize prostitution, but the anti sex work crowd has had some very effective marketing in the past few years."

Hookers,3595lx,malibijones,1 point,Sat May 9 23:44:57 2015 UTC,"Sadly, it's a social issue that's politicized. IMO, prostitution should be legalized and regulated with mandatory testing, safe sex standards, and redlight districts. The provider should pay income taxes on compensation and the John should pay a VAT tax that goes to STD prevention/resources for providers.  It will only ever be legal in the US when there is enough economic incentive to do so. You see this with Gambling. When states were in trouble during the economic crisis, they created casinos they could tax the hell out of. Unless there's a need for new tax revenues, you won't see much movement towards legalizing prostitution."
Hookers,3595lx,CourtofOwlz,3,Sun May 10 23:07:49 2015 UTC,"Ugh. All these rules and taxes mean that the legal prostitutes will be $400 and up, which most John's can't afford. Which means there will still be an underground illegal market in the $100-$200 range. Problem not solved."

Hookers,3595lx,ILikeTheHobby,1 point,Thu May 14 20:27:27 2015 UTC,"The regulated model of legalization seldom works very well and would be a very hard sell.  What neighborhood is going to sign up for a red light district?  What working girl wants to formally register herself someplace to be a sex worker?  This more or less works in rural Nevada but it hasn't caught on anywhere else.   A better model is the Australian/New Zealand model.  Start with the presumption that what two consenting adults do in private is their business alone.  If that involve an exchange of money, so be it.  Regulate sex work only to the extent that any other business activity is regulated.   The advantage of this is that most people intuitively ""get"" that what goes on in people's bedrooms should be kept private.  That avoids the whole debate over ""how should we regulate prostitution?"" The answer is, well, you don't regulate it.  But like any worker, a sex worker must pay taxes on income, laws about consent and age apply, and where desired, zoning laws can keep the whole activity out of sight."

Even a private club will have a website with information on how to join or who is accepted.  Also, fetish/dungeon work is NOT escorting.  Most BDSM establishments specifically do not offer escorts both because they want to avoid client misunderstandings about what they offer and also to stay within the law (in most parts of the USA, consensual BDSM is not illegal or not prosecuted, although giving hand jobs, etc. is.)

If the masseuse doesn't give you a happy ending, then give a meager tip. Also make a note of it. Soon you'll have a list of all your favorite AMP's.   Good luck...and happy exploring! :)"

Probably best to focus on the dating part rather than the sex part, if you want a relationship with her.  If you just want sex, then you should become her client."
Hookers,34vccw,justanotherhobbyist,5,Mon May 4 22:15:50 2015 UTC,"Probably interested in you.  Doesn't mean you should go through with it even if she is hot.  Good qualities to look for in a serious partner are things like mental stability, financial responsibility, trustworthiness (she was honest right away so good sign there) and the like.  Figure out those things.  The fact that she is a sex worker alone is not damning if you're okay with it, some guys are while a lot of guys are not.  Some hookers can be quite professional about it and she might even be the bread winner which is a positive."

Please note I said to look at the threads (a few pages worth) before posting- what you're asking has been asked many, many times before.     Lastly, if you feel scummy don't do it.  It's a hard business and if you're not confident that you'll be able to tolerate the work... try driving for uber or something."

There is a reason why you see so many porn stars doing cam shows, private vids and touring, unless you are in the top 10%, there is not a lot of work or money in it for you.

Two providers unknown to each other will typically just take turns on you so you wind up with two half hour sessions and pay for two hours. Much better to specify all the stuff you want to do in advance or they're not gonna want to give you a real nice double blow job and swap spit with a whore they've never met.
Hookers,34sknw,Randomquestion421,4,Mon May 4 05:02:50 2015 UTC,"Not a cop, but lots of redflags. I am guessing either drug user or a minor. If she really is living with her mom and needs to sneak out of the house, then probably a minor looking to get some extra cash. A lot of times when they arrange a meet and disappear it is because they were looking to score a fix and found someone else to get it for them.  There is a small chance this is some legit new comer, but I would keep your guard up. If you do meet, only have enough cash to cover the meeting and no credit cards, also besides your phone, no other big valuables. Have your phone locked and a way to remote wipe it (or get a burner phone)."

Hookers,34ospg,Grumpi83,2,Sun May 3 17:34:30 2015 UTC,"Nah. I got circumcised because I thought that I was supposed to have already have been circumcised.  To put it in context, I'm from the country country...but not originally. One of the things that is just a part of life in some areas is getting thrown into a bathtub buttass naked with your cousins. Well, I was the only one who wasn't ""clipped,"" and it was brought up. We are talking about 5-9 years old or so at this point.  Later, my mother started asking me about it. I wasn't taught anything about having foreskin, I wasn't taught about retracting it and cleaning it, etc. So, I couldn't fully retract the foreskin. But, at the same time, it was pretty clean.  My mother is in the healthcare field, and she started asking me ""innocuous"" questions about it at some point after my cousins had probably told her about a couple slightly older girls I could get to sit on my lap on the bus ride home. ""Is there white cheesy stuff?"" etc.  Well, eventually, she got on a kick about it, and I had been seeing porn and in the porn I saw every dude was circumcised, and so I agreed to see a doctor.   Honestly, one of the worst mistakes I've ever made in my entire life, although at the time I had no way of really researching things for myself and knowing the possible outcome.  Of course I somewhat simplified the answer, but that is basically why. The reason why I WASN'T circumcised, as opposed to all my brothers, was that I apparently almost died in the hospital when I was an infant. I was too sick to risk cutting."

Hookers,34jbhl,GumbyGumbee,1 point,Fri May 1 17:12:40 2015 UTC,"Logically, this would be the case, if you were looking for a lunchtime fuck and needed to find someone on the quick.  Anonymity is important, so most escorts gravitate towards metropolitan areas for work.  However, BP is very much a dangerous place for hookers and johns alike because it's so incredibly accessible, but that same open-door policy is what makes it so appealing.  This means that there are a lot of other doors that are closed to you, simply because you don't know about them.  This is also a good thing, depending on how you look at it.  Less frequent visits to providers mean you should be more discriminating: instead of trying to get laid in an hour, you'll be setting appointments for a week in advance.  Most low-volume escorts aren't incredibly eager to put themselves out in the open.  If the nearest quality escort is an hour away, you'll want one a dependable person who makes you feel awesome, rather than a BP quickie.  Check the sidebar for more options.  Also, check on sites like NR for agencies: while most agencies advertise in a major city, the incall is actually somewhere else."

Have you checked up on any past reviews about this duo, or are you going in blind?  Have you done business with either of these girls before?  (A threesome requires the other girl be recommended by a provider I already know.)  Are you going for a single shot or multiple shots - and if the latter, are you sure these girls are going to put on a good lesbian performance while you recuperate?

Also, girls don't really quote half hour or hour prices here, it's short time or long time and what exactly that means really depends on the girl. I've had short times as short as 20 minutes and I've had them as long as four or five hours, or even sometimes the girl staying over until the morning.  A lot of girls here are on yaba (methamphetamine and caffeine pills), if you get them on the up they are usually hyper horny and the sex is great, but if you get them on the down they will immediately fall asleep after it and you won't be getting them out of your bed until some time the next afternoon."

Anyway, went back like an idiot, they made mention that I must really like massages. Saw Yoga Pants, undraped but with much less ass play. I caressed her with my hands a couple of times and she pulled away. She was cool and distant on my way out, so now I just feel like the perv that I am and won't be going back. But it's clear that unwittingly or not, they are using sex to sell a non-sexualized service, like Hooters. And it worked.

When she starts brushing against it, really tell her that that's nice.  If she doesn't shy away (and it sounds like she won't) go ahead and put her hand right on top of your peen.

Hookers,340mzm,mickjz,15,Mon Apr 27 10:59:47 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you're making a lot of unjustified assumptions about the person you had sex with. Let me ask you this: if women offered to pay you for sex, would you do it? Many men would probably answer yes. Would you consider those men exploited? Almost certainly not. So why would you think that when the genders are reversed?  I think your perspective is somewhat sexist. It treats women as though they don't have the intelligence to make informed decisions about their bodies. You also seem to think these women are weak and need some sort of protection that men don't need. And it is based on certain gender stereotypes; there is no reason to think that women are less capable to make sexual decision than you are. And many women enjoy their sexuality the same as men.  Also, what is the difference between treating someone as a sex object and treating someone as any other kind of object? Employers treat their employees as dishwashers, cash registers, computers, drivers, or builders. From the employers perspective, employees are just objects hired to perform a given task. That's it. How is that any different than hiring a prostitute to perform a given task? The risks? Tell that to people who work on roofs, in coal mines, or with electricity.  If you think sex is for some reason a special case, I think you should re-evaluate your puritanical assumptions."

After I left, I was just thinking about the server's perspective. She didn't want to serve me my food. She was only doing it for the money. I was hungry and it didn't completely fill the void in my stomach. To top it all off, I realized I had just supported an industry which cannot be a good thing for the servers (they are being used merely as food-serving objects, not as people who have feelings). I just thought about my server as a human with feelings the same as me and I felt ashamed of what I had done.   Sounds pretty stupid right? So why are you making a special case with sex?"

A burger maker probably hates making burgers some days or for some people but if you offered him $500 for an hour of burger making he'd probably be happy as a pig in mud.

Hookers,340mzm,Daty_Dato,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:05:26 2015 UTC,"First off, did you treat her with respect and as a human with feelings and her own perspective? If you're convinced this is an industry that treats women merely as sex objects, you should do your part ensure you treated her as a person and not just an object. She's a person that's providing you sex, just because you had sex with her for money doesn't turn her into an object. That's only if you think that's the case and treat her like such.  Next, I think you're just having a huge mess of your personal feelings  mixed in with the fact you paid for sex. If you ever do go back to a hooker, you should do so knowing full well what you're going to get: no strings attached sex in exchange for money. If you're trying to use the sex as a substitute for some other failing in your personal life you'll most likely end up disappointed.  I've always talked extensively with the hookers I've frequented before having sex with them. With some I find we're not a match and I just move along to someone else.  I know everyone has their own reasons for going to a hooker, some just want to get their nuts off and couldn't care less about the girl. But if you're going to come here oozing guilt, is it really about the industry and the girl, or is it about how you treated her and the experience?"
Hookers,340mzm,zs_throwaway_salad,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:29:54 2015 UTC,I treated her with respect. We talked for a while afterwards in the shower. She seemed nice.

Asking you to bring condoms is weird.

Hookers,33vlpe,GumbyGumbee,2,Sun Apr 26 03:22:55 2015 UTC,"Most legit providers have a rule: No text messages or phone conversations that discuss the act or anything related to it. Why do they have that rule? Evidence. This person is either very careless or is perhaps gathering evidence. Either way, the text message would be a deal-breaker for me."
Hookers,33vlpe,jtbrown1,1 point,Sun Apr 26 03:32:50 2015 UTC,"I had a backpage escort ask if I had condoms.  She was legit.  Don't worry about police stings on escorts' clientele, they are not common.  What you should be concerned about is being ripped-off.  Take not of where she puts you money, and if she has a bad attitude or does not let you use your own condom dont be afraid to take you money and leave.  If the escort tries to put up a fight pepper spray her.  Most escorts will let you use your own condom.  I prefer durex extra sensitive for vaginal and durex tropical for oral (unless of course she lets me go bareback, then I prefer condomless oral and vaginal sex)."

Hookers,33vvau,hopeucanswim,1 point,Sun May 3 16:25:46 2015 UTC,"Because the vast majority of providers know what to look for and only have safe sex. Civies, not so much."

A pro might be seeing a few guys a month etc, maybe less the way some of them charge.   Now, if you go out and meet some random chick at a bar or club and take her home, she could be doing this a couple times a week etc.    Point being, there are dirtier every day girls out there.

It definitely has reduced my desire to get involved with regular romantic relationships.  In my city there's an endless supply of gorgeous, interesting, 19-24 year old 9-10's that are looking for this sort of thing.  I could easily meet up with a few per week, and sometimes I have done that.  But what you'll eventually realize is that these sort of relationships are pretty empty, even though you might share a very real connection.  If you think there's a shared romantic interest, you'll start to wonder - is she really interested in me, or in my money?  And you'll realize that, regardless of what she tells you, she probably has other similar arrangements going on at the same time, and there's a very good chance she has a regular boyfriend as well- one that's much younger and more attractive than you.  So ultimately I wouldn't worry too much about getting too involved in this.  In the end I'd bet you'll yearn for a regular relationship in time, but you won't be as desperate for it.  /r/sugarlifestyleforum may have more advice for you too.  Edit: I'll also say that, if you're thinking about turning a SB into a regular girlfriend, please think twice.  I've done it a few times and they've all been incredibly crazy, not really capable of healthy relationships."
Hookers,33tvk5,justasdthrowaway,3,Sat Apr 25 19:28:52 2015 UTC,Thanks for this. It's pretty much what I needed to hear. I think I'll continue to pursue real relationships but have fun with this girl on the side until I find her. I agree that turning this girl into a regular girlfriend would not be a good idea.

Hookers,33tvk5,P_throwaw,2,Sun May 10 06:08:32 2015 UTC,"Well I do see a couple red flags.   If she's asking you to hang out but still insist that you still pay for these meetings, she might just be playing off your emotions for her and trying to maximize the amount of money she can get off you.   Here's what you do: Let her know that you are interested in getting to know her outside of work.  Ask if she'd like to grab a drink or get coffee sometime.   If she declines, then you know she's not interested to getting to know you outside business."
Hookers,33tvk5,manslutalt,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:31:33 2015 UTC,"Any of you ever meet someone so hot that it messes with your normal relationships and causes you to just kinda stop trying as hard?   You now have what PUAs refer to as ""abundance mentality"". You have high quality pussy on tap, so you no longer bother chasing other girls. That's a good thing, because it makes you more attractive and it allows you to relax and focus on other things.   Ever sleep with someone so hot you're addicted?   Sure, a few times. The addiction wore off after a while. You should watch out if you start obsessing over her. Just relax and enjoy it while it lasts."
Hookers,33tvk5,SwagLikeUs,3,Sat Apr 25 16:38:37 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but you have completely botched the abundance mentality. Abundance mentality is the idea that you have so many options of women (eg. An abundance) that a failed interaction with one particular women can be brushed off the shoulder. It also postulates that because you have so many options, you are not tied to desperately wanting a beneficial outcome with one particular girl you are seeing. You can basically afford to fuck up a date or ""relationship"" because your options are in abundance.  What OP is going through has more to do with the porn viewing ideology of the PUA community which states that excessive porn use lessens desire to meet actual women because our needs are satisfied via digital means, and getting our nut causes less desire to approach real women. The difference here is that it's with real women - he just purchases the experience. Likely same or worse effect as porn with regard to lessened motivation to meet real girls."

Stop worrying about her seeing other men (just assume that she is) and enjoy the ride.  As for regular dating, if you've got a super hot NSA girl on tap, then you can start concentrating on other things with the women you're dating: personalities, compatibility, that sort of thing."
Hookers,33tvk5,midnightyeti,0,Fri May 1 01:56:00 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't recommend trying to have a serious regular relationship with an Escort or SB, they will always be after your money one way or another.

They teach newcomers what to expect from legit providers and how to detect possible scams or stings. That's important, but not for people who already have a working system in place. As a mod, I'm not sure how to approach this issue because our community should probably be welcoming to both new and experienced hobbyists.

Like you, I entered this realm in plain vanilla fashion, and I have yet to shock a provider with a request.  So the question is, what's kinky to you?  Think about your fantasies and what you have always wanted to happen, then talk with her about it.  What trips your trigger, so to speak?  Role play, anal play, food play, oily/slippery/NURU play, bondage, water sports, tease and denial, pain, humiliation, strap-ons, threesomes (FMF, MFM, MMF).  Just ask and talk about boundaries.

A freelancer offered to go for $5 after I declined her initial offers of $20 and $10."

At the time I remember services were as low as 70euro to start.   Off the strip, several blocks back were mostly African girls and older ladies.     Prices in the red light district were cheaper (by a few hundred)than agencies to send a girl to you hotel.    I stayed at the corwn plaza near the airport and the train ride was maybe... 15 minutes?   What ever you do stay out of the strip clubs.  It's a scam and not worth your time and money."

I just did a Google image search using the photo in the URL I sent to the girl, and the photo didn't come up in the search results, so I guess that's a good thing, right?

They didn't make any mention of offering ANY kinds of services (sexual or otherwise), and I didn't ask a single question regarding what she was actually interested in doing with whoever she met on CL, or what she charged for anything, etc. I simply provided some brief physical stats with the blacked-out eyes photo.   Would that be enough for the cops to have ""probable cause"" to arrest me, even though there was never any mention made whatsoever of offering her money in return for sexual favors?  Also, something else in your response piqued my paranoia -- can you expand on what you said regarding people trying to screw folks over? I understand that CL is littered with ""sign-up-for-this-background-check-website"" scams, but are there folks who post on CL with the specific intention of blackmailing others?"

You didn't make any mention of money for sex so its unlikely that you'll be arrested.   It's not a sting operation. They would push you to ask for sex for money and would do so in person. Its a big stretch to bust you for a phone conversation or an email/text.   If you continue shopping on CL.. you are doing it wrong.  Multiple review sites, that have free accounts.

The thing is, the girl looks really hot in her pic (even though her face isn't visible), which is why I suspected that it might be a sting operation.

The thinking behind it is that a client who had to save up to be able to afford the fee is more likely to be more hard work eg want to haggle about the rate, hassle for extra services, watch the clock until the last second of the last minute to get his money's worth, wheras a billionaire for whom the fee is pocket change is more likely to just have a good time and behave himself. I've never found this to be the case. I have noticed when I've raised or lowered my rates at various times that if I advertise cheaper than the average rate for escorts in whatever area I'm advertising, eg if I advertise a 30 minute rate, I do get more ""cheap"" guys contacting me who do tend to fit the haggling, boundary-pushing, clockwatcher archetype.

They'll see the phone calls you made and they can track where you have been by using cell towers (assuming you were carrying the burner with you).  Also, for those of us with significant others, a separate burner phone isn't very practical. It just increases the risk that they'll find out."

Hookers,32atyb,cp9406,3,Mon Apr 13 13:44:28 2015 UTC,"I found a newbie friendly provider that had a solid reputation.  She wasn't my ideal in looks, yet was OK.  She booked the appointment after a quick conversation where I basically told her that I was new, a little nervous, and excited to jump into the hobby.  She never asked for personal info. Used the first to see a stunning and very well reviewed lady who advertised that she needed two references.  Because of the reputation of the first lady, she accepted my request. My third encounter invited me to join P411.  I used the other two ladies as references for P411, and they waived the employment screening requirement.  It's been easy ever since."
Hookers,32atyb,justanotherhobbyist,2,Tue Apr 14 04:35:10 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of ladies that can verify you with just your personal information. You will need to provide that to them. You can make a free account on sites such as TER or Eccie and see that the lady has reviews. Generally, if a lady has more then 10 reviews she's legit. (some ladies do end up with reviews that are scams, but its usually only a handful of reviews.) Attraction is in the eye of the beholder.   Its a big world. Since you didn't mention where you are, I could recommend a few in Costa Rica. Would that help?"

Hookers,327q24,BigNex15,4,Sat Apr 11 08:39:05 2015 UTC,"Some agencies are great. Some aren't.  Some agencies are run by pimps some are simply booking agencies.  If you are using TER, don't focus on the agency, focus on the individual lady that happens to work for an agency. Select that way and make contact with the agency. If they happen to have a few different ladies that you like, you can give the agency options. Its best to ask for the specific lady you want. If she isn't available ask to see the next. Don't give the option to the agency at first.   The advantage of an agency is that often you have multiple options and only have to make one ""call"".  I prefer dealing with independent ladies, but even many independent ladies use a booking agency."

Hookers,325m8g,laybak,3,Fri Apr 10 19:49:38 2015 UTC,"Your looks don't matter. At all.  Trust me, I'm not ugly either and it doesn't get you anything extra.  You booked super short with what sounded like a BP type lady. She probably thought you where dying and that you'd finish up in a matter of minutes like most guys do. She probably slipped you in to make the money and had other plans.   Often times, identifying things like tats are edited out. I almost saw one girl who looking at her pics looked tat free, but her reviews said she was covered. (not why we didn't see each other)  Often times, the first time isn't anything special. Doesn't sound like you made the wisest choice though. Most everyone of my dates is set days/weeks in advance, occasionally longer.  One of my online buddies rolls like you did all the time, he has a lot of average dates on the cheap, rarely does he find a gem doing so.   My one time doing basically what you did, turned out okay as well. She had the best tits I'd ever seen as well. bj was covered, no kissing. Super tight though :) In and out, with plenty of time to spare. She wasn't kicking me out, but it was obvious that the date was over.   Next time, if you can give yourself enough time to pick a great lady out, will be a far different experience. If you hobby model is last minute dates, it'll probably be typical."
Hookers,325m8g,Daty_Dato,3,Fri Apr 10 22:05:10 2015 UTC,"Some people just don't click even if she's otherwise a great GFE provider. You probably haven't clicked with every bartender, stylist, clerk, server, etc... either.  On the other hand some girls just aren't really GFE or PSE, they don't have the energy, they don't care and it's more of a throw your dick in, get your nut and leave while she stares at the wall type of deal. Obviously most people like a GFE that can fake passion or a PSE that has a lot of energy. That means your best bet are women that are known in the community as high quality providers and you'll pay for the quality of their services. Most of them will not see you 45 minutes later or even same day. Too many guys drunk dial girls, they don't wanna deal with drunks/drugs, also they don't have as much time to dig up info on you and check references.  The other thing is, as a newbie, most the real well known girls won't see you. So you'll have to bag a few questionables to get references or P411 OKs."
Hookers,325m8g,xelormy,3,Sat Apr 11 03:13:37 2015 UTC,"Well stated. My first ""date"" wasn't my ""type"".  I selected her as a newbie because she was newbie friendly and had a ton of experience. (100+ reviews)   If I saw her again, it would be a completely different date, far more enjoyable."
Hookers,325m8g,Daty_Dato,3,Sat Apr 11 12:35:00 2015 UTC,"Yep basically same as me. Went for a girl that was newbie friendly, she had P411 and was on the boards, but she still did a lot of BP work. It was a bit shady, wondered if she had a pimp, but she was cute enough and I did cum so... it was ok I guess. It was totally mechanical and awkward. Even our interactions before jumping into bed were awkward since I felt like I was acting out a role I learned online after reading what not to say and how to behave.  Now it's totally different and you're right I could have a more enjoyable date with her since this business is now just natural for me. I setup dates in like 4 texts and don't act all weird when I get there which I'm sure freaked the first girl out too, probably wondered if I was a cop lol. However I'll stick to the higher end girls since they are much more fun :)."
Hookers,325m8g,xelormy,2,Sat Apr 11 19:04:53 2015 UTC,"Yes there is a learning curve with providers. What to say and what not to say, how to act. What to do. Most of it can be learned and all of it can be found online.  Even experienced guys have awkward dates. Sometimes you don't click and all, you may slip and say something that you shouldn't have. Or she may be having an off day or you might as well. As long as you aren't a dick IRL just be yourself and relax. It'll work out."
Hookers,325m8g,Daty_Dato,0,Sat Apr 11 19:13:29 2015 UTC,"Treat the girl like your on a date. Be confident, if your nervous she will pick up on it and feel uncomfortable too. Make her laugh and tell her she is fucking sexy. Pull her close and tease her a bit.  You just have to remember it maybe 'work' for them but we all kmow work isn't work if you enjoy what your doing.

It's easy to work for an agency - but private work requires organization, dedication and love for the job.   Expect to pay anywhere between $350 - $1000 per hour dependent on what you're looking for.   There are plenty of ""hot"" sex workers, but not many that have the looks, personality, professionalism and skills. Trust me, you want a friendly worker, not a ""hot"" unpleasant one.

They also have a ""vault"" where supposedly they have some Hollywood actresses (small time, b-list, but still recognizable) as well as some fashion models.  Edit: apparently MyPlatinumProvider won't let you see the escort they have without signing up, it used to be anyone could look at who was available.  and finally Escorts  http://www.dreamteamplaydate.com/  I think there $300 an hour (and in my opinion look as hot as any $1500 pornstar)  I haven't used any of these services but have been tempted."

Hookers,323zbo,collegeguy1492,2,Fri Apr 10 14:52:45 2015 UTC,"He is referring to back channel communications. Most of the high end joints advertise exclusively on review boards. So if you become a member of a board, contribute and start posting a lot of reviews, you get invited to one of these back channel groups. Some are shit (more about gossip then girls), some or outstanding (Some guy flying in his favorite porn star for the week and taking request for appointments at well below market rates).  Most high end ladies are usually part timers who consider modeling (or whatever) their real job and this as some way to supplement their income, so it does not make sense for them to advertise regularly, also when they do come available, their time is snatched up so quickly, it does not matter.  In larger cities (NY, LA, DC), the high end clubs / bars / hotels all have a guy who knows the good connects for out of towners, but this is for high rollers only."

If there is a cop there, you think you will just say ""oh never mind"" and leave? Nope. Once you enter the room, you're getting arrested.   -you pull up to a street girl who refuses to get into your car, you think you're going to be allowed to just pull off and drive home? Nope. Once you pull over, you're getting arrested.  In all these cases, you have already engaged with a prostitute, and have established the intent to participate in illegal activity. You will be arrested.  What you need to do is avoid the sting in the first place."

I don't understand this war against consensual sex between adults in the US.  I really don't."
Hookers,320j1u,TTTT27,2,Mon Apr 13 05:45:45 2015 UTC,"Not exactly the case.  Yes, if the cops want to arrest someone, they will make up just about any pretext to do so.  But in order to be prosecuted for prostitution, you have to actually agree to exchange money for sex.  Just pulling up in a car, for instance, won't cut it.  People may pull up to offer a ride, to see if someone needs assistance, to have a conversation, or just to pull over to make a phone call or whatever.   Similarly, there are lots of reasons why someone might enter a hotel room.  Unless an exchange of money for sex has specifically been agreed to, there are no grounds for prosecution.   Of course, the point of these stings is usually to embarrass and shame johns and call girls.  And some jurisdictions try dubious tactics like putting mug shot pictures on billboards, so the arrest is essentially the punishment.   That said, the smart way to go is, so not agree in writing or in spoken words to exchange money for sex.  No one with brains in the industry would ask you to.  And sex, in and of itself, is still not a crime in the USA."
Hookers,320j1u,jtbrown1,2,Sun Apr 12 02:41:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, and that is also what I meant. You may not get convicted or even charged, but an arrest will ruin a married guy's day. And that's what they want to do - embarrass the Johns."

Hookers,31yve9,slightlytainted,2,Thu Apr 9 07:29:09 2015 UTC,"I tip people (not just sex workers) for going the extra mile, if I did something shitty like being late, or even when they undervalue the work they did for me, in return I sometimes get freebies and discounts. For instance back when I drove second hand cars I had a great independent mechanic, he would consistently underestimate the labor cost of doing work for me. He really wanted the business. I would feel bad and tip him some extra cash because I know he put 7 hours of work in and charged for 3. I never saw very many of his other customers doing that. He started to do let me jump the queue, and do small jobs for me for free, like when I needed him to do spark plugs on a car with inaccessible plugs (I didn't own a lift), it only took 30 minutes. He didn't charge me for stuff like that, I'd maybe just give him $10-$20 bucks as a tip.    Bartenders are another example, you can't walk up and expect free drinks, but as a good customer who takes care of them with tips you can often start getting some free drinks or generous pours. Now when that happens, if you've been tipping them per drink, you still tip them on the free one.  So my point is, if you book her for a bunch of hours, expect to take care of her, but if she decides some of your hours are free that's awesome. It doesn't matter if it's because you're such a great guy or she just really wants your business, enjoy and tip the lady for a job well done :)!  EDIT: I don't do FBSM so I'm not sure on the costs. I don't tip providers every single time, since I only see independent girls with reasonably high hourly rates, tipping just because seems a bit excessive to me. I only tip these girls for when they do something extra for me as a regular (i.e. freebies) or if I fuck up and I'm late or something."

I've had no problem finding them on EC, TER and BP where I'm rarely screened but I'm also not trying for $$$ or higher type. When is the best way to negotiate the rate down a bit? Is it during TCB or BCD? I've only been seeing them if they are willing to keep it at $$ or under including FS. Do they ever offer lower rates if you promise a review? Do you prefer Hhr or Hr? I found with Hhr I'm only able to get in one pop. Have you ever gotten a scare? STD/STI, management shakedown, broken condom, LE or something else? Do those ever cross your mind?"
Hookers,31unsj,myhobbythrowaway,1 point,Thu Apr 9 02:30:49 2015 UTC,"At least in my area, the vast majority of ladies listed on P411 are 300 and up.  Good luck negotiating, The only dates I'd negotiate is longer dates. If you show up and try to negotiate with a well reviewed lady, you'll be leaving. Might work with BP ladies. I don't do hhr dates. Until recently most of the ladies in my area only offered an hr., though hhr's are starting to pop up more and more even with the reviewed ladies.  LE crosses my mind but I only see well reviewed ladies so it's all in my own mind. No STD issues, I don't understand the management shakedown thing, never had an issue with any of the agency ladies I've seen and I've never dealt with someone that could be a threat, I don't see the type of girls that would have a pimp. Never had a broken condom had one fall off once.. and another situation that we won't discuss..."
Hookers,31unsj,Daty_Dato,2,Thu Apr 9 04:09:07 2015 UTC,Another random question but why would escorts/agencies keep easily accessible client lists/information if it's just going to be used as information against them or others? Look at this: http://www.usnews.com/news/newsgram/articles/2013/05/31/maine-zumba-case-ends-with-10-month-sentence-for-prostitute  Keeping so much information was incriminating against both her and her clients.  How could potential hobbyists make sure that they don't leave much of an information trail?
Hookers,31unsj,johnjohnawaythrow,-6,Thu Apr 9 14:06:32 2015 UTC,"Here's one thing I have been pondering: would you agree it would do most women the world of good if they worked as a hooker and a cam girl for a bit? It might teach them a thing or two about how men work, how their pussies are not worth half a house and how for the rest of their lives they can just shut the fuck up instead of looking down on women who actually take pride in making men happy.  I understand this has nothing to do with your post, but I've been spending a lot on hookers recently and it is not helping. I hate my wife even more these days."
Hookers,31unsj,CaptFlintstone,3,Thu Apr 9 00:05:37 2015 UTC,"You realize no one's purpose in life is to make you happy... right? That includes sex workers, they perform a job for a wage. The job is giving sex, the wage is what you pay her. Her job is giving you a specific service you're happy with, not changing the general level of happiness in your life. You can't ask for a refund if her pussy didn't cure your depression. Furthermore base levels of happiness are not long term influenced by individual experiences. For instance if you were very depressed about the overall state of your life and I gave you a Ferrari, it would make you happy for a little bit, but eventually you'd go back to the level of happiness you had. It's a general representation of your life as a whole.  What do you do today to make things work with your wife? If she's so terrible why'd you marry her in the first place? Too young? Kids? Shotgun? If you time traveled and got your wife to become a sex worker for a year before you married her, how would her acting like a sex worker make you any happier if sex workers don't make you happy today?  If you're not happy together either fix it, divorce or just ignore the problem. You could easily just keep seeing hookers and keep your second half of the house. Or if just getting pussy isn't enough, but you still won't fix things or get a divorce, you'll just have to live with it.  I guess I really don't understand what you're trying to say. But really you have limited choices:   Do nothing. Part ways with wife. Try to fix relationship with wife.   Wishing that more women know how to use their vagina for cash isn't one of the solutions. Not that there's anything wrong with prostitution, I just don't see it as a solution to your problem."
Hookers,31unsj,xelormy,1 point,Mon Apr 13 10:32:34 2015 UTC,"I think men and women would probably both be better off if they had more information about how the other gender tends to think/feel, what they want, and how to give it to them. Good sex workers probably come to the business with some understanding of that, and working helps them get better at it.  Still, it seems like you're angry/unhappy with your wife; my hunch is that while she may be overestimating her value, you may also be underestimating her value. Or, it may be that you don't want what she has, and she doesn't have what you want, and vice versa, so you're not or are no longer a good match for each other."

An agency can get the ladies listed on there. Then the guys can use that site to set dates. Its light verification but better then nothing.  You can also use personal information though the majority of guys aren't going to like it.   You could set up an account on TER. There are some ladies reviewed in Japan. (I checked) It isn't a lot.  With the free account you can post on the boards. Post your question there, there are a number of guys that travel worldwide and might be able to point you in the right direction.

Hookers,31kubg,backpagenavigator,2,Mon Apr 6 01:14:22 2015 UTC,"There's no stupid questions.  I'm in escort in Toronto and I can answer all of these really specifically to the area :)  Donation usually happens before any action, and can be either discretely passed to her or left in some visible location.  Yes, rates vary wildly.  I'd avoid anyone on the low end of average ($250/hour is pretty standard here).  TER is great.  Toronto also has TERB.cc and CAERF.cc, you will find MANY more options on those two.  All three boards are good at monitoring and removing fake reviews, and so are their members.  (And fake reviews are pretty obvious, IMO - newly created accounts with glowing reviews of only one woman, only one agency, etc).  Stay off Backpage in Toronto for a first-timer.  Seriously.  TERB and CAERF are free for clients and have advertising there.  There's also Eros, Slixa, and Cupid's catalogue (Redditor shout  out!).  If you MUST BP, yes, you can leave.  If she hasn't grotesquely misrepresented herself, a nominal fee for her travel might be appropriate.  If it's clearly not her (a lot of Asian agencies come to mind, but there are others), don't even bother doing that.  Bad behaviour shouldn't be rewarded and you might consider writing a review for other people about it.  You could say anything from ""I'm sorry, you're not what I expected"" to ""I'm sorry, I have to cancel last minute"".  If you choose providers that are well-reviewed this won't be an issue, and Toronto's review scene is extremely active.  Most of the lower-mid+ end women in Toronto will NOT charge less for any specific activity.  Sure, you might be able to find someone on the street who charges by activity, but do you really want to get involved in that for your first time?  Better to go for someone who charges by time and explain what you want.  Garage ...what?!  No, that's not going to fly.  There's nothing wrong with letting an escort into your house, especially if you've done your research.  No one is going to meet you in your garage, that's super-sketchy (not to mention cold and blatantly disrespectful for her).  A happy escort is a better experience.  CBJ is a good idea depending on what you're worried about.  Some STIs are transmissible via BBBJ but your well-reviewed, well-connected escort is WAY more concerned about her sexual health than the average civilian woman.  She has a lot more to lose.  BBBJ is pretty much the Toronto standard.  As a total aside, at 18 don't be shocked if someone asks to see your ID.  I'd probably ID you and ask you to cover your legal name but not your birthday and photo.    Honestly, it sounds like you should do incalls or an outcall to a hotel room you've rented as you seem uncomfortable letting someone into your home.  Maybe you could consider an agency for a first time? No good agency or well-established independent is going to EVER do any of the stuff you're worried about; it's terrible for business and they wouldn't last.  You really should log into at least TERB.cc and take a look around for whatever it is that tickles your fancy.  Reviews are going to be your friend in this situation ;)  Some resources:   r/torontoescortreviews is pulling reviews off TERB and posting them there.  If you're scared of TERB, it might give you an idea of what you can find. TERB, CAERF, TER for Toronto in that order. CHECK REVIEWS!  Toronto is really great for reviews. Established outcall-only agencies in Toronto: Cupids, Vixen's Established mixed (incall and outcall) agencies: Select, Mirage, Jersey Girls, Top Drawer, Exquisite Established incall-only agencies: Roommates   Have fun!  I promise it's nowhere near as scary as it seems :)"

If its a bait and switch you always have the right to walk away. You don't even need to discuss it, if you don't want to. Just don't get much past the door if you go in at all.   You can find different rates for different activities. You can find someone offering a B&G. (blow and go) Recently read someone locally don't that in a car, for 100. (car date) You can find ladies walking the track (streetwalkers) that charge less.  I prefer bbbj. bareback blow job's. but yes covered is safer.   I can't speak to Canada's market.

Incall probably unless you have a nice place to your own (which i doubt at 18) or want to splurge for a hotel too.  ""Do you think escorts will provide me with services in my garage? I would close the door after (is this sketchy it will be well lit)?""  Nope.

Owners can easily say that they have no idea what goes on in an individual massage room, and they don’t condone sex for money. Inside those rooms, meanwhile . . .  “The cops aren’t supposed to take their pants off,” one NYPD supervisor said. “So that’s a problem. Most of these transactions occur after the massage starts. There’s rarely a clearly stated verbal agreement beforehand, which you need and needs to be recorded if you hope to bring a winnable case. How is the undercover going to get that?”  Even if a case is made, solicitation arrests, particularly for first-time offenders, often lead to wrist-slap charges, which rarely dissuade parlors from reopening. In Queens, for example, the NYPD made 686 arrests for prostitution and loitering in 2014, which included street walkers, escorts and erotic masseuses, but all were misdemeanors. Those efforts did little to disrupt the Flushing industry activity."

Unless a would-be customer makes incriminating statements to an undercover officer, (""Here, let me pay you $150 for sex"") then nothing illegal has happened.

Here's the thing, most providers will kiss you, a light peck, pretty much right off the bat after they see the tip's been left on the table.  That's pretty much the secret handshake for ""We're not cops"".  Those providers that do french kiss will only do so after mouthwash, just as a pro-tip.  An undercover sting will ask you to request the exchange of sexual services for money.  Basically, if a provider mentions both a price and a sexual act prior to getting naked or doing some sort of intimate act - you should ""Nope-nope-nope"" right the fuck on out of there.   If a provider offers anal on as an up-sell, for example, while you're balls deep in her pussy, that's fine.  Here's what you want to happen at a full blown AMP (versus a rub&tug).   Go to an Asian ""Spa"" in a sketchy, light-industrially zoned area of town.  Note that if you have a large Asian population, there are large spa & sauna complexes that are not gigantic whore houses - if it has a restaurant, you're in the wrong type of establishment.  Have Mama-san, usually in her 60's or later, ask you if you want a half or whole hour.  Always get the hour. Go in and be led to a small room with a bed-table, mirror, loveseat, and poor lighting.  You may be asked for the house fee.  Take the remainder of the tip an place it on a table in plain sight, then strip down into a towel. Have scantly clad woman come in and grab the tip, she may give you a kiss on the lips. She'll likely go for a moment to stash her tip, particularly if mama-san didn't grab the house fee. Your provider will come back, offer you mouthwash, kiss you again and then lead you to the blissful experience of your first table shower... Teh fun times commence.    For a rub&tug, treat the experience as a legit massage until they start to tease your inner thighs, junk, or ass.  Groan in sensual approval when they do.  On the flip, say yes if they ask if you want sexual favors.  The smart ones will not ask for an amount, some of the ignorant ones will... particularly if they're Chinese.  You can say no if you're paranoid, but generally, a police officer probably wouldn't massage you for upwards of 20 minutes and tease your junk..."
Hookers,31at2s,tehfuntimesaccount,0,Sat Apr 4 15:55:44 2015 UTC,"It is probably going to be fine as long as the parlor is continuing to get good reviews. The police aren't so dumb that they can't find them. I find it hard to believe that none of the police that knows about massage parlors would never use them because they are all Dudly Do-right impersonators.   If I was a member of the police force and I had the power to prioritize what crimes to go after, I wouldn't go after a massage parlor until they they caused trouble such as make it hard for neighboring businesses to function, or started to give consistently bad service.  There are much easier ways to catch enough prostitution to meet quota such as a fake Craigslist ad, or having a street walker sit on a corner in a low rent neighborhood."

Renting a motel and posing as a hooker (and arresting people who show up for appointments), sure, but a whole massage parlor? Nah.    On the other hand, there's always the chance of being caught in the massage parlor when the cops/health inspector shows up to bust the place.

Why is it safer?  You said it yourself:  she has sex for a living.  Disease ends that livelihood, so escorts are going to be very careful, get tested frequently and do everything they can to be safe.  That one night stand in the bar is far more likely to go bareback with you and anyone else she meets.  This doesn't apply to all sex workers, of course.

Hookers,30z85i,0000void0000,5,Fri Apr 3 07:50:05 2015 UTC,"I have had sex with many escorts. Maybe 3 or 400 almost always in brothels which is my preference rather than inviting one back to my place.  The advice I wood give you is treat the girl like you would treat any girl you would meet for a date. Make her feel comfortable, tell her she's sexy, make her laugh.   Don't worry about how the intimacy or physical interactions begin she has done this all before and will usually be very good at initiating the whole thing. Almost all the escorts I have seen do a 'health check' which is a visual inspection of your penis to look for any signs of STD. This is perhaps the most uncomfortable part but I'd prefer them to do it.Then there is usually a shower that you take with the girl. I love This part. This is where it gets good when all of the fun begins it's great.  Try not to be too nervous. Maybe have a few, but not to many drinks before you go.  I have had some really fun experiences with escorts. I think if you approach it the right way by being confident, easy going and fun loving I think you and the escort will have a great time.  I would in general trust escorts more than most others eg.  Real estate agents, car salesmen etc I once left my wallet at a brothel cause I was drunk then went home and didn't realize until the morning. I went back and the madam says don't worry we have your wallet safe and sound and gave it back all the money was in it which was $1500.00 cause I had been playing the slots."

Hookers,30z85i,anonymous_pervert123,1 point,Fri Apr 3 02:28:14 2015 UTC,In all honesty it's probably safer sleeping with escorts than it is with girls who are easy to pick up at bars.

Hookers,30z85i,Daty_Dato,8,Sun Apr 5 06:14:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, depending on what personal information you are willing to part with, you can use TER to find women. Even with a non VIP account (free) you can at least tell if the lady has been reviewed. You can even see their Website Link. You won't know the juicy details but if you select a few ladies that have 100+ reviews (a lot less is okay but keep it above 20) go to their website and make contact. You'll have to admit that you can only provide personal information as a reference. Some will work with you some won't. Make a ""date"", be really clean and go have a good time. The worst it'll be is vanilla sex, which sounds like something you'd like. You can usually find a menu list (services provided) on their website and their rates.  Most providers are just like any other lady treat them with respect and you'll do just fine.   You can expect some small talk once you arrive. The get to know you stage. Then it usually progresses to kissing (if they offer it) and to cloths being taken off and sexual activities taking place.   Most ladies understand that you are nervous. Often they are a little as well. Complement them. Your body language needs to be open. Hold her hand, stroke her arm/leg. Nothing aggressive. Sex is going to happen. Relax and enjoy it. The ladies with that many reviews almost always offer seconds. Book and hour or more if you want more then one orgasm.  If you need something special or really want a particular activity you'll need to get VIP to figure out if what you want is on the menu though you may well find it on their website.  It really isn't all that complicated. You just need to take the first step. If you want to do it more then once, you might consider (I would and did) getting verified and getting VIP."

Hookers,30z85i,anonyboo,3,Thu Apr 2 01:07:15 2015 UTC,"Pieces of shit like you make me want to become a vice cop, then arrest and incarcerate every single filthy disgusting hobbyist.   Imagine if clients were looking for advice, in a client space, and came across a sex worker letting them know that deep down they found them filthy and disgusting?  Toxic attitudes breed toxic attitudes, breed toxic attitudes.  Review board culture evolved in the context of a society that doesn't talk positively about sex work, and routinely denigrates clients as perverts and quasi-rapists. Equal parts bravado, fantasy and lore, it feeds on that vacuum, for better or worse.  Have you ever stepped back and approached the industry from the perspective of a client? There is advertising for commercial services, and there are hobbyist boards. Starting out as a client 6 or so years ago, hobbyists were the only communities offering any information or first hand accounts, and to a large degree, they are still pretty much all there is. Review boards are the only place where visiting sex workers is accepted as normal. There are no local client unions/collectives, no academic discourse, no 'client du jour', no Richard Gere movie where a client makes a substantial and welcome ongoing economic contribution to the life of a sex worker, but continues to live happily ever after with his wife...  If you have a problem with hobbyists, contribute positively to places were sex workers and clients are welcome, and nobody is shat on or excluded, or dismissed because of their preferences. If you want to continue the status quo, then piss off back to a 'safe space' where you can bitch about clients all you like. I mean, how dare a client talk with any authority about the experience of a client?"
Hookers,30z85i,LOVE_YOU_SHORT_TIME,-2,Thu Apr 2 03:21:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think that way about my clients. I also have zero tolerance for 'hobbyist culture'.  I have news for you - when you actively participate in a system that seeks to further disempower escorts, yeah, you're as good as a rapist.   Yes, I've approached the industry from the perspective of a client. (Finding a good escort that goes for the ladies is a pain! I had to wait for a friend of a friend to visit.) That doesn't change how disgusting hobbyist behavior is. Any decent person will find it revolting. Any respectable escort won't tolerate it. Any worthwhile client will be repulsed by it.  There are 'preferences' and then there is downright shitty behavior. Advocating a system that exists primarily to degrade sex workers is unacceptable, period. There are all sorts of fora in which clients can discuss things that don't involve writing reviews or the shocking misogyny inherent to review boards. The kind of man who promotes that sort of thing should be shat on, excluded, and incarcerated - it's called 'aiding and abetting', and countless coercive rapes have been perpetrated by hobbyist assholes.  I like to contribute positively when I can. I can't deal with the constant stream of bullshit that some like to spew. Creating a community where everyone is welcome starts with respecting sex workers. (Oh, and '/r/SexWorkers' is not a 'safe space', it's been hijacked by the same sorts that browse around here.) Referencing review boards or encouraging measures to hide identities demonstrates a fundamental lack of respect for us."
Hookers,30z85i,anonyboo,4,Thu Apr 2 08:24:19 2015 UTC,"I hope you have another gig in life. When you are at the point where you are so broadly hateful of clients, it is time to get out.  There simply aren't forums where clients are encouraged to participate on an equitable basis. There are client dominated review sites, and there are forums policed by sex workers.  Review boards are the first port of call for most curious men considering clienthood, for better or worse. Some are toxic, some are passable. I do not know of any client forum without a review section of some description. That is the reality of the sex industry in 2015.  Clients have every right to share information. Clients, engaging with an industry that is rife with deception and scams, want assurance that they are not walking into a bad situation. Clients have a culture of sharing information that is not going to go away. Nobody else is looking out for them.  Most clients graduate from such places once they get a bit of experience and find a 'scene' they can operate in. At that stage they are pretty much a 'lone wolf'. A tiny few frequent places like this and share experiences. Without participation from level headed clients with experience, the tone turns toxic pretty quickly. I (and others) sat out a significant part of last year after a tediously similar argument at /r/sexworkers about client participation, and the result was a familiar toxic mess.  Really, get a grip on yourself and think about what you are doing. The clients and potential clients here are curious and skew young. But here you are pulling back the curtain and smearing all clients as rapists. Do all escorts share your contempt? Clients should shut the fuck up, not speak up, not participate, and just eat whatever shit you wish to serve up?  Losing your shit like this in public will do more to harden client attitudes than any bullshit review.  Whether you love them, or hate them, clients will still fuck you if you are offering sexual services. It is better for everybody if they believe the former, not the latter."
Hookers,30z85i,MrLocust,-3,Thu Apr 2 13:05:19 2015 UTC,"I adore my clients. I also have standards. These standards are how long term sex work becomes sustainable.  Sex workers policing forums is what keeps them equitable. Otherwise you get toxic circlejerks and admins who start power-tripping and try to coerce freebies out of escorts.  Defamatory speech isn't a right (it's actually criminal if directed at a woman's sexuality in my state) and gossiping is crude.  This isn't an argument, this is 'quit doing shitty things'. You don't get to defend shitty behavior, and if you try, you're a terrible human being.  Not all clients are hobbyists. Yes, anyone who has been around a while either shares my contempt for hobbyists or has succumbed to Stockholm Syndrome. It would be nice if good honest men spoke up and participated, and they do from time to time, but then they also get shouted down by the assholes.  Honestly, does it matter? The kind of man who responds favorably to the idea of degrading sex workers like that is already lost. These types, even if they aren't rapists, enable the others."

As I find myself getting deeper and deeper into the hobby, I often find that how well I get along with a provider and how much we can adapt to each other is far more important than how she looks or what's on the menu (fortunately, I don't ask for much, and her menu is large enough that every visit is an education)."

Yes, she was newbie friendly, though may that say it, really aren't. I booked a two hour date with her, as further incentive to see me. The advantage of seeing someone like her, even though she wasn't exactly my type, was that I new she'd be a great spring board to seeing other ladies. She not only referred me to a friend she also gave me an okay and whitelisted me on TER. It was very helpful. Still struggled with dates until I got to about 4 okays. Then it was easy. Now, when I ask, other then a time that doesn't work for the lady I never get rejected.  You could also try ladies that will take your personal information as well as P411, just see very well reviewed ladies and it'll be okay."
Hookers,30zzz6,justanotherhobbyist,2,Wed Apr 1 02:13:57 2015 UTC,"Contacting a lady in your area that is willing to see Basic + 1 is a worth a shot.  Trying to convince her that you are cool is not a good idea.  You are a newbie, and hence, not cool.  You are a risk.  Be extremely polite in your request to meet.  Approach as though she is doing you a huge favor, and maybe it will work.  Or maybe you will at least get some good advice from her.  My first contact with a provider was a very well known and respected lady in my area.  I was polite in my request.  She was very polite in turning me down.  She gave me some great pointers on how to get started.  I followed them and then contacted her again when I met her screening requirements.  Once I had references, she gladly scheduled time with me.  She remains my ATF today."

I was, and I'd been having sex for decades. If you pick the right lady, and if you are willing to give up your personal information, (not to me) I can help you find a lady that does interest you. (I'm WELL versed on Chitown's local and traveling talent.) Just PM me.   I'd do it, just don't make a habit of it. You probably haven't experienced life yet in the real world (a real job) and there are ladies out there that make good partners if that's what you want. Just because you haven't found anyone yet, its no reason to stop trying. Maybe getting laid once or more with make you seem more appealing.

The western chicks I have been with have almost always been up for doing kinkier things than Thai girls (hookers or not).  Source: Someone that has had a lot of both partners and has been living in Thailand for 5 years.  Probably have better luck in the Philippines but in both places the girls have plenty of free will and can/will say no to crazy requests.  I think finding what you're looking for in Thailand will be quite difficult.  There are a couple of clubs that cater to this taste (bar bar in bangkok I believe?)  But the chicks are not hot at all."
Hookers,30t58j,Daty_Dato,6,Mon Mar 30 17:56:33 2015 UTC,Is it Thai women you are attracted to or the BDSM?  There are 1000's of women that offer BDSM in the states and they are easy to find. There are 1000's of Thai women selling sex in the states as well. The vast majority of the later don't offer BDSM though I'm certain some do.

Hookers,30t58j,I_bang_ladyboys,1 point,Mon Mar 30 22:19:37 2015 UTC,"There are BDSM clubs and hookers who specialise in it, if he goes to a club and discusses what is allowed up front I don't think he'd have to worry about ending up in jail.  It's not exactly a huge thing, though, to the best of my knowledge there are two or three places in Bangkok (Bar Bar and Demonia) and one in Pattaya (the Castle). And that's about it. There are freelance dominatrixes but I don't know about subs... I think if you were looking for a sub better to do it in a club environment where limits can be agreed in advance and with a third party. It's generally a lot easier to find dom than a sub.   It's not cheap, either, by Thai standards, but I imagine it is a fair bit cheaper than in the West. I've never done it simply due to the cost, if I had unlimited money I certainly would. I've limited myself to a little light stuff, tying up and getting tied up by random hookers who are willing to go along with it. Nothing heavy or involving pain at all.   I imagine there is a lot more of it in the US, but one of the issues here is that while in many (most?) dungeons sex is not on the menu, it absolutely is in Thailand.   If he has the money, though, from talking to other people who are a bit more actively into BDSM than I am, Japan is unquestionably the place to go, it's far far more common there than in Thailand. It would also be much more expensive."

The two main places people go are Bangkok and Pattaya.  In Pattaya you have one place called ""The Castle"" it's 900 baht (25 US) to get in that includes one free drink. They have some basic spanking shows, usually a head girl that drags some of the sub girls around on leads if you want you can pick one go to a play room tie her up, pour wax over her, spank her with your hands/and or toys and get a blowjob or fuck finish whatever you want at the time. All in all a short visit ends up costing 5000+ baht (150 US)which is alot for Thailand.  Bangkok has a couple clubs I forget the names you can google them if you want same idea 900 baht first drink free, cost 7000+ baht for a session with some drinks.  neither place is ""do anything you want"" it's not the best value IMHO  You could try Devils Den in Pattaya it's not BDSM per say but you get 2 girls of your choice for 90 mins, unlimited pops that perform with you and each other. They have sex slings, dildos, strapons, paddles, etc light bdsm stuff the right girls will do alot of fetish stuff like golden showers, foot worship, cum swapping, use strapons on you while the other blows you, etc whatever you can figure out.  http://devilsdenthailand.com/ there is the website you can look over if you want"

A pro sub won't let you do whatever you want in the sense that you can just pay a fee and then make up the rest as you go along.. She'll have services she offers and others she doesn't and it will all be agreed along with the price beforehand.  I lived in Thailand for 3 years and had a lot of fun there but there's almost no kink scene there and I'm guessing vanilla working girls in Thailand will giggle/not understand what you're on about/smile, nod and take your money with no intention of actually doing anything kinky with you.

If you want more, just hold your little man and point to what you want. Don't use your words. Then negotiations will begin. If she says tip first, some say don't. some say do.

I don't know any other civilian who does that, so an affair runs a higher risk of STI transmission.  Seeing a sex worker also rarely involves an emotional attachment like an affair. You don't know the sex worker, you don't know if her life story she is telling you is the truth and you certainly don't keep in contact with her outside of a booking unless planning to make another booking.  Seeing a sex worker is just sex. I don't mean just in a negative term, I mean that is the only need being fulfilled. Having an affair shows there are far more problems in the relationship bevause you have sought another person to fill that void, be it emotional, attention, sex, etc."
Hookers,30kcyi,sheririana,5,Sat Mar 28 09:17:09 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The monetary investment in a sex worker is nothing compared to the emotional investment in an affair. I feel like my donation is even less for the time and more for the guarantee that once you walk out my door, you will never hear from me unless you initiate it. Most of my clients tend to talk up their wives, as if they fear I'm judging them as bad husbands, telling me about how lovely/kind/beautiful/sexy she is, but they just have hit that dead bed point. Sometimes it's just out of years of comfort or that weird shift of only seeing them as mothers, sometimes its a bit more tragic.   (I have a regular whose wife was the one to contact me, because she had been paralyzed for several years now after an accident and felt like he deserved it for being so supportive. It was weird at first and made me pretty sad in the beginning but I ended up pretty close to both of them. He was so absolutely in love with her and I know that while he saw me as a friend outside the bedroom, in there he seemed lost thinking of her. One of the more surreal feelings in the world is having sex with somebody that you know is not thinking of you as a unique and distinct person with your own traits and quirks, but for it to be in such a way that you feel not only content with it but almost like you're doing something bordering on holy like the prostitutes in Greek temples.)  I would say I think of a relationship like a house. All houses need constant work to be maintained but really they are strong safe places to keep the world from ripping you to shreds. A healthy sex life is the swimming pool. Not all houses have to have one. Some have gotten rid of theirs and are fine, but sometimes one person drains the pool. They may have good reasons, they may not, but either way- the pool is empty. You can try to go to counseling to discuss the pool. You can split a bottle of red while watching synchronized swimming. You can buy all kinds of sexy pool toys. You can go out with your friends and throw $2 at water fountains knowing you can't touch them, but still, your partner doesn't feel comfortable filling the pool.   Eventually it will be hot, too damn hot to handle and you'll wonder if this house is even worth it without a pool, and you'll pay for a day pass to the public pool. Once you've cooled off, you realize your house is still strong and holds everything you've built. You don't want to move in at the public pool, they don't offer anything but a cool place on a hot day. The public pool will not share a Netflix account with you. The public pool wants you to get the hell out at close and isn't going to wonder what you're thinking about before you fall asleep.  An affair implies that there is more wrong than just an empty pool. The pool may have started it, but then you noticed other things like cracked windows and squeaky doors. Maybe the empty pool on a hot day makes those seem like bigger issues than they are. You start hanging out in a co-workers pool. It's always full, and because you don't have to live in that house, it seems like everything is better. The towels are always clean, you never have to take out the trash, the house never needs repairs. Perhaps you'll stay at this house now.  An empty pool is easier to work through. Getting a person to understand all houses need work eventually is harder.   And wow, that analogy went off the rails. I may have gotten a bit brunch-drunk and bombastic."

Hookers,30jc8k,StraightRidahs,2,Sat Mar 28 01:09:35 2015 UTC,"I've never understood why anyone would choose to do this rather than just escort. You're meeting a client without cash up front and no way of knowing whether they'll just waste your time and never pay. The arrangements are usually for some huge amount of time and for a tiny fraction of what you'd earn charging an hourly rate as an escort. I enjoy escorting but I'm so used to what 1 hour feels like that any booking for more than 1 hour feels like an eternity whether it's dinner or sex or whatever. I have met girls through duos, renting my flat out for an hourly incall location etc who are super impressed by how much their sugar daddies spend on dinner, drinks, hotels, travel etc but they're getting paid next to nothing if you calculate it hourly. I'd rather just do hourly escort bookings and pay for my own dinner etc with someone I actually like."

I've never canceled that close to a date, I've had a few ladies do so. Shit happens.   Once I wanted to cancel, I was hung over (vegas) bad, chugged like 8 bottles of water.

I just saw a lady that I had requested to see twice before. 1st one, she refused. Years later she said yes, but I had to cancel as she couldn't do the location I wanted. She was to far away. Something like 3 years later and we finally met. I'll see her again. :)"

Dude, I see ladies all the time, often having more then a G in my pocket not including the envelope. I don't see sketchy ladies that I have to worry about it with. Reviewed ladies have a reputation and a business to protect they aren't going to steal a few dollars from you. Many of them are pulling down 5k or more a month. The few hundred in your pocket isn't worth it.  I rarely tip these days. If I'm paying 300+ an hour, its enough. If they are fantastic, I'll write a glowing review, mention her to other dudes in the area, and see her again if she's willing.  If you want to tip for great service, an additional fiddy is good but really anything is appreciated. (leave the fiver in your pocket..)  Being nervous is normal. Just try to relax and enjoy it. Don't be aggressive or demanding. Its okay to ask for specifics if that's what you desire, but do it nicely. If she's doing something you really like, just say something like, ""oh wow, that feels wonderful, don't stop.""  I recently saw a lady that, was very specific when I was (insert my name) and it was a bit off-putting. I don't need to hear, ""oh you are licking my clit so good.""... I know I am, just enjoy yourself...  It was sort of like a bad porno. Weird to me anyway.   You are entering a no judgment zone.

The downside is that to make really big money, you'll need to have it seen everywhere. Needless to say, you'd lose any privacy and it would likely follow you around forever. Still, big money.  If you want to do it discreetly, you have a few other options. The easiest would be to contact a high-end escort agency in your home town and tell them what you want to do. They'll know how to proceed. While they will want to post photos of you, you can insist that said photos don't show your face. Again, this will be trade off - people will bid more if they can see who you are.  If you want to handle it yourself, you'll need to spend time Googling to figure out where to advertise. As a rough estimate, though, I'd estimate that you could get easily about ten times the average hourly rate with very little effort.

The screenplay was written by Polly Platt. The plot focuses on a 12-year-old prostitute in the red-light district of New Orleans at the turn of the 20th century.  The title of the film is inspired by the Tony Jackson song, ""Pretty Baby"", which is used in the soundtrack. Although the film was mostly praised by critics, it caused significant controversy due to its depiction of child prostitution and scenes of the nude Brooke Shields, who was 12 years old.

She has a TER review page, with 7 reviews. Just looking at the comments you can see without signing in, it appears most think she has too many restrictions and her prices are high (for them).   So it does seem legit. You'll need to contact her to see if you can live with her restrictions and prices."

Hookers,303k7o,Thereisalwaysa1st,5,Tue Mar 24 04:26:26 2015 UTC,"No, you don't get a virgin discount. Save up if you want the extra time. I highly suggest you see said provider for at least 2 hours if you are going to lose your virginity to her. It will be nerve wracking and uncomfortable for the first 30 minutes while you calm down. You'll want that extra time to talk to her, get to know her, establish the sexual desire, and the do the deed."
Hookers,303k7o,TheOldestProfession,3,Tue Mar 24 07:33:06 2015 UTC,"xpost from my response when someone else asked this exact same question a few weeks ago (same person? This is your fantasy and you're faking this to get people to talk to you about it?)- See an escort you can afford. Don't try haggling. She'll either say no if you ask her to lower her rate for you, or say yes but then resent it and do the minimum she needs to do to get rid of you.  I wouldn't mention the fact that you're a 20 year old virgin to an escort. She'll most likely assume you're just wasting her time.  Whenever anyone tells me they are young and/or a virgin I know they're almost certainly not going to turn up to an appointment. They'll usually just want to ask lots of questions about services. ie they're pretending to be a prospective client but just want me to buy into their fantasy and interact with them while they wank.  A lot of escorts won't see clients under a certain age for this reason.  We just want clients to book appointments with a minimum of fuss, show up on time, pay and be clean, polite and respectful.  It's rare to find anyone under 40 who can manage all of the above.  If you call and say you're a 20 year old virgin, can't afford their rate, want this service and that service etc, they'll hang up the phone on you and block your number..  If you call up and immediately mention the day and time that suits you, ie straight to the point, they might give you a chance. If so, Enjoy!"

Some guys can manage three.   Make sure you see someone that offers CIM. Knock that first one off in the first few minutes if you manage to hold off long enough to get it out of your pants.   Get the date, make sure you are really clean.   You could try something like, (if you know shes MSOG) just say, something like, baby, I really need to cum. With the right ladies, she'll get to work right away. Some it won't. A lot of ladies love to talk and get to know you a bit first. Lately, I think I've been giving off the LE vibe.

Just use google images and check the photos. Of TOFFT and go find out. You can always walk out without paying if she isn't what you want. Just don't take long, and I wouldn't get much past the door if I where planning on walking out.  Reviewed ladies often have their faces blurred so your no always going to know exactly what she looks like either but most of them are using real pictures. The last thing they want is Reviews saying fake photo's.  More often you'll get reviews saying old photos. Its still rare but more common with ladies around 40-50.   Personally I assume the lady is going to be 5 years old then stated. Sometimes I'm pleasantly surprised. I've never needed to walk out on a date, I don't have a looks fetish."

Hookers,2zomwo,jasonlee087,1 point,Sat Mar 21 02:24:43 2015 UTC,"I shared the same concerns. At various times I've used my CC to sign up for TER and Rubmaps, but only for a month at a time. In my area there just aren't enough new reviews to justify having paid subscriptions for longer. Oh, and I've gotten a few TER memberships by submitting reviews.   A couple of months ago I wanted to sign up again and tried using a prepaid card, but neither site accepted them. Dumb moves on their parts, if you ask me."
Hookers,2zomwo,HowDoIWords,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:50:55 2015 UTC,"You could use a prepaid if the site will take it. You could use a money order. Bitcoin in some cases.  Just because you are on a list buried in some file doesn't mean they will ever look at you. LE doesn't backtrack stuff its cheaper to move forward. You/I are insignificant.   Go buy a prepaid for 25.00 and see if it works. You can always use it for lunch someday if it doesn't work.  I don't believe you can use a prepaid with TER. I've read that people couldn't. Some do send money orders.  Both TER and P411 are out of country. Less likely to have issues with local LE, and those are the guys/girls you need to worry about. They'd have to perform miracles to get to those servers. Hell they can't get Hillary to turn over a server then probably have rights to. How are they going to get one in Canada?"

She isn't just some brick and mortar business, she's a real human being with some feelings and emotions that go along with her working in this industry.  Honestly I'd talk to her about it. Tell her how much you appreciate her and how great you find the relationship to be, but be upfront. Your interests are piqued and you'd like to explore them without hurting her feelings or making her feel like she's unwanted.   While I don't think it's a big deal and this is ultimately a business, you still have the right idea being tactful about it."
Hookers,2zn6iw,TheOldestProfession,3,Thu Mar 19 23:54:04 2015 UTC,"Ask your provider to arrange a duo. See if they'll do a 30 minute threesome for $200 each. That way you get to see the new girl without your girl feeling left out, you get the fun of a 3some and you spend less than you would have on an hour with the new girl. They're likely to agree to it since they know each other. And if they're both getting paid at the same rate it saves your girl any embarrassment she might feel if she had to take a smaller fee than her friend."
Hookers,2zn6iw,AussieMaleEscort,3,Fri Mar 20 12:33:55 2015 UTC,"Do the math. You could and I'll assume the half hour rate is 100ish, 4 visits with your ATF but would choose to see one lady that is 450? So you think the sex is 4x better? What happens if the 450 an hour lady becomes your new ATF but you can't often afford her?  You are setting yourself up for heartache. I stick in the price range I find acceptable. (money isn't the issue but would be if I started seeing 600hr ladies regularly) Acceptable being what you can afford.   I guess I don't see the point.  You've got an ATF at rock bottom prices and want to shop around?? Enjoy it while it lasts, then shop around.  This coming from a guy (me) that shops around all the time but would love to have an ATF at that price. I'd probably ride it out as long as we enjoyed each other."

I was pointing out the number of visits you could have with someone that you know provides great service. For me, after seeing numerous ladies, the sex is roughly the same. The only difference is the connection.. the passion. I had that connection, (yes it was in my mind only) I still saw other ladies but those visits dwindled because the gulf between the experiences was so vast. Right now, you get great service at an amazing price. Why mess with it.  I've done dozens of ""one-time"" visits invariably they are less satisfying then the one(s) where there is a connection. I mean what if you meet this lady and she blows you away. What do you do then? Sometimes not knowing is better...   But hell, you'll probably see her, I probably would."
Hookers,2zn6iw,slightlytainted,2,Fri Mar 20 03:22:35 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would stay with my ATF... 450 is out of my price bracket for it to be a regular thing... and to be quite honest, I rather give my ATF more money then a total stranger.  But I'm weird like that so....  I would do a threesome with my ATF though and pony up more money... but see, some of that money would still go to my ATF.  But just so you know... I don't have an ATF, but that's how I usually am about things."
Hookers,2zn6iw,P_throwaw,1 point,Fri Mar 20 05:24:19 2015 UTC,"If she's truly a professional then she wouldn't have the slightest issue with being asked to be a reference.  Just ask her casually if you can use her as a reference in the future.  She doesnt need to know who its for, it's not really her business.  It'd be like going to see another masseuse that offers different services or has a different technique.  It's really not that big of a deal."
Hookers,2zn6iw,manslutalt,1 point,Fri Mar 20 00:00:58 2015 UTC,"Are these concerns unfounded?   Not entirely.

What I've often find is that if you go out of your way to try to make the provider have an orgasm (or five) of her own, she'll be game for MSOG.  As Daty said, MSOG is usually standard, especially for an HR appointment: most guys simply can't last 15 minutes, much less an hour.  (Though I've never tried Viagra, so maybe there is that.)"

Also, make sure your photos are somewhat decent and you don't look like a street walker.  For me, a good escort is one that isn't detached during our meet. I'm not looking for a connection, but it makes a world of difference if you're at least acting like you're somewhat into it.  Bad reviews happen every now and then, I overlook them if there are a few, but skip past multiple bad reviews."
Hookers,2zihp0,zs_throwaway_salad,3,Wed Mar 18 21:31:48 2015 UTC,"TER, NR, and ECCIE (among others). But no more BP, if you can help it.  Get to know other escorts in your area. No client is going to stay exclusive to one provider, ever. One of the advantages of those three pages is that you can start networking with other escorts about potential clients. There are two ways to verify clients: verification services (very secure) and other providers (riskier, but it at least shows they're not cops).  Enthusiastic: nobody likes a clock watcher. Don't be detached, and don't give your smartphone a second's notice. Until the appointment is over, that smartphone is off.  Clean: not just you, but your incall (if you have one). One of my favorite providers, bless her heart, is an absolute sweetheart, but her incall is a total mess, which makes me worry about her. At the very least, a clean and tidy incall hides as much of the real you as possible, allowing your clients to indulge in their fantasy.  Pay attention to every part of your body. You never know what will drive a man up the wall: it could be the dimples on your back, your abs, your clavicle, your hamstrings, and of course, your feet. Keep it all maintained, then write off your gym membership, salon visits, and makeup as a business expense.  You might be a bit young to remember a film called Boomerang, but well...let's just say that, next to a Brazilian, a pedicure is a girl's best friend.  Skills: Not just things like giving a good blow job, but giving a good hand job. Or a foot job. Or a lap dance. Or whatever: I once had a girl wrap my cock up in her hair then use it as a sort of lube when she stroked me off. Up to that point in my life, it was the weirdest turn-on I've ever had because I never thought of good hair in that way before.  Now I can't watch a shampoo commercial without getting a boner. (Thanks, Gabby.)"
Hookers,2zihp0,zs_throwaway_salad,2,Thu Mar 19 06:00:25 2015 UTC,"Oh, and another thing: I don't know what you do to screen out your clients (shit, I don't know much about screening, period), but get with other escorts and refine your methods.  It's great that you're weeding out the time-wasters, but don't weed out potentially good clients along with them simply because you're using a limited set of criteria."
Hookers,2zihp0,zs_throwaway_salad,1 point,Thu Mar 19 23:29:23 2015 UTC,"Of course. I don't think I do to much of it. My screening is very light. Just your name, age and place of work.

Hookers,2zfrq5,AusJackal,5,Wed Mar 18 12:30:27 2015 UTC,"TBH it isn't worth having casual sex if you are going to worry over this so much.  So if I were you I'd do some in depth research on the topic and truly convince yourself on what the risks are.  In practice they are extremely low, and the severity of most STDs is also low so to me the risk is very low.  But other people might find that unacceptable anyway and then they shouldn't be having casual sex.  Also FYI hookers don't have an especially high STD rate so be sure to look that number up, too."

Hookers,2z7we6,d1a8lo24,2,Mon Mar 16 10:27:15 2015 UTC,"This is not a directory, its a search engine, I know it indexes 4 of the most popular domains which are backpage, eros, citybive and slixa.  Most of the time people have to go through google to search numbers, emails or just particular services like GFE, incall, outcall etc...  Well instead of getting a bunch of websites that probably don't relate to what you're looking for ALLQts.com actually does a good job on just searching on websites that cater to the adult industry.  There are many sites out there but is nice to have one where you can search and find what you're looking for, sometimes....  So in my case I like to find latinas with blonde hair where I am visiting.  So ill search: los angeles blonde latinas, or los angeles downtown blonde latinas.  You get the picture... now if I just type blonde latinas well I am going to get a bunch of results from all over the US.  The concept of a search engine is to narrow down your search by using keywords and the first keyword will be your location.   Also backpage is not the best but it is the one with more providers even though 90% of them use fake pictures and 60% will probably robe you depending on your location.  I use this site, to search phone numbers, emails and names of providers just to see if they have other post and if the images at least match. You'll be surprise how many providers post different ads with different pictures but the same number. The site helps me see how many of the post ads through out those main websites.  Is not the best tool out there but it does good job."

Hookers,2z66x4,jello8888,5,Sun Mar 15 22:57:33 2015 UTC,"I agree that you should always treat your provider nicely & added tips are always super nice. However, if you are EVER concerned about sexual contact with no barrier then I advise definitely getting tested (if for no other reason than to ease your worries) & carry barriers with you so that if things ""come up"" you are prepared.  In the situation you described, I personally would not be concerned (as the patron) with being tested, but as I said, if it makes you feel better then do it! Most areas have health clinics that will test low cost or free depending on where you live.   As for complete bareback... I am a sex worker & even I will not bareback with other sex workers who can provide months of testing negative for STIs. Why? Paperwork is easy to fake & some STIs (STDs) have incubation periods so a bareback encounter with someone who showed negative on all STI tests today might come back to haunt you 1-3 months later :/   And awesome for you being open to a little more action than some people are :) Great that you found something else to enjoy in your encounters!"

I arranged a meet by sms, but couldn't get any straight answer on where to go once I was in place. Eventually the girl gave me a description of myself and asked if that was me, and everything went well after that.  The problem was that I wasn't exchanging smses with the provider, but with the agent. I believe the provider had a client when I first arrived, because I saw a man leave while I waited. The agent probably tried to get in touch with the provider but had a difficult time because she was busy getting rid of the previous client..  I'm not saying that's what happened in your case, but stuff like that happens. Maybe your provider was just crazy, on drugs, mixed you up with someone else, something like that. Forget it and move on."
Hookers,2z0z7u,hobbyinaz,2,Sat Mar 14 15:42:49 2015 UTC,I think she is real only because she has photo shopped the SHIT out of her pictures.  She is a fat gutted whale my friend.

Hookers,2z0z7u,datebecky,2,Sun Mar 15 20:42:21 2015 UTC,"IF you're trying to verify her service, you might want to go with someone that has more than 1 or 2 reviews, if you're more interested in the quality of the service.  With that said just go and see her, her pictures look real enough. Plus she has a big tattoo on her stomach so you can verify that way when you get there.   Now if she doesn't have the tattoo just leave. Why do most people feel like they have to stay?  Maybe if everyone did that most of the providers wouldn't use fake pictures. But that is never going to happen.  A few tips when browsing classifieds on an escort directory.    If it looks too good to be true then is time go to the next ad. If she looks like a model but her rate is less than 100 go to the next ad Look at the background of the picture and try to see if it's a hotel, if it is its more likely that she is real. Most providers now a days can't afford a real photographer so they use their phones to take pictures and since most of them are in hotels its a little easier to tell.  as much as you can trust tineye and google image search they are very easy to fool, all you have to do is flip the image, you can also change some of the colors or reduce the quality to around 50% also blurring and retouching will bypass many of the image ""finders"" out there. try to do a look up either by her phone number or email on google, make sure the phone is enter this way 555-555-5555 else you will end up with some weird results.   At the end the best thing you can do is go check her out.   you'll put an end to your curiosity. reviews can be submitted by anyone even them and your experience may be different then the rest, who knows you may click with her and end up getting a few extras or she might just take your money and run away but you will never know unless you try it. and you can come back and tell us if she was the real deal."

It depends on how the agency works though she probably has to give them a set fee for the referral so she'll keep the extra anyway.  Tipping isn't required. Ever. If you think that she went above and beyond and exceeded your expectations you certainly can tip her. 10-30 percent sometimes more.   The best tip you can give her is to ask to see her again.  Did you cross reference her services on theeroticonline.com?  You'll know what she's done with other guys that way. You'll need VIP to see the juicy details.  You can always cancel an appointment with sufficient notice and it should be without penalty. Just don't do it the day before.  My name probably gives away my opinion on #2....    Get VIP and find out what she offers. The vast majority of providers that I've seen and read about, offer MSOG once you get past the low end (rate wise) If its 400 an hour, if should always be part of the deal."

(rare)  For most, I imagine it wouldn't make much of a difference. I also imagine that some would relish it. I probably wouldn't say anything until you actually got a date and meet your first lady face to face.  Most ""dates"" start off with some oral. You probably want to see a lady that offers CIM. You won't last. Just give her a heads up that you have no experience, she'll know what that means.  Most guys would recommend that you jerk off before hand so you'll last a bit longer. I lean the other way. Don't jerk off the day before. That way it will be super intense and you'll never forget it. :)  Make sure you see someone that offers multiple shots on goal..  No you can't use a review as a reference. How would that work?  Tipping isn't required or expected. When I started I tipped every time, now I rarely tip.   You need to get verified. Join P411 or even RS2K (I'm sure there are others) then seek someone out that is newbie friendly.

It isn't always 100%. Just because every guy got greek (anal) doesn't mean you will. With every service offered there is a little bit of YMMV (your mileage may vary).  These services cost money.

She was a cute 18yo customer service rep at the back then, and although we were now both older and wiser, it was still great to fuck her after all those years. She either didn't remember me, or was professionally discrete.  But about 6 months later, a friend of my wife's came to stay who has been a sex worker on and off through her life. She has told her friends (and my wife has told me), but isn't 'out' to me. She mentioned that she was thinking of buying the apartment she was living in. I asked ""those new ones, by the park?"".

If she looks okay you'll probably say why not I'm here and horny. It might be a good time...  I've done that. It's always been okay but I'm going through an agency type and anyone I see is going to okay. CBJ from most of the ladies, but from there it varies widely. Some will rim you. Some are better and into it, most its a clinical trip and it'll be okay.   LE, doubtful. No phone, can't check it. Email didn't return a listed provider on the site I checked.  What do I think? I think you want a hot Asian lady. Yellow Fever? (its okay I had it at one point) I wouldn't see her because I don't have any information. It could be a dude answering the door. You can't even talk to her.   I'd seek out other sites for ladies.   If this is a one off situation then best of luck.  If you think it'll be a regular type of thing, get verified and get theeroticreview or some other review site and see ladies that are listed there. Its safer and you'll know what your getting.  Ladies that look like that will probably be 500 plus an hour.

They aren't likely to take your plastic...  Without asking you'll never know, she may hang up. Just move on but she should know she didn't list a price, and will need to tell you how much. If she asked how much your willing to pay, don't answer it. Either hang up or keep chatting with her until she's comfortable and tell you. I hear that most just tell you.

I've considered seeing Asian women that I'd never consider if I lived in Asia (or even just L.A.), such as chubby Filipina escorts. There are, of course, some Asian massage parlors, but the women are generally about 40 years old.  Where in Asia are you, if you don't mind me asking? Do you work there? Is your firm hiring?

Hookers,2yh9m8,hookerthrow22,2,Mon Mar 9 23:02:57 2015 UTC,"Haha ""chubby Filipina""... You need to move to LA. Honestly, every city within 40-50 miles of Downtown LA has at least 2 agencies servicing the city. The rate is pretty consistent - $120/HH, $160/Full. The only problem with that here is they're known to use fake photos, but it's not like the girl is ugly, it's just that they're not even the same girl. But if your fetish is Asians, then it wouldn't bother you too much as they are still decently attractive.  Oddly, sometimes I do enjoy AMP's, knowing full well it's an older girl... they tend to give the best service and are pretty friendly. The challenge with BP is it's almost turned into a ""pump and dump"" site, where it's not the time it's all money - so they try to get you off ASAP."

Asian to me is 'normal' now.  There is a great legal brothel scene here, and independent escorts are generally tolerated. Brothel prices are US$80-120 an hour (you are better off paying the top end). International Easter Europeans are around $200 an hour, and 'exotic' nightclub girls are $400-600. High end touring girl can be $800-1200 or more.  I would love to recommend you, but unbelievably, I have a rep at work for being the straight man. A lot of expats get on the party scene, and drinking is a popular pastime. I tend to retire early from bar crawling on work trips 'to be fresh in the morning', but in reality will book an escort.

If I were you, I'd make the occasional trip to Philippines or Thailand, two places I definitely plan to visit as soon as I can (I've never been to SE Asia).

Hookers,2yh9m8,ambassador2,1 point,Tue Mar 10 01:12:24 2015 UTC,"Singapore is really easy to travel from. Most places are 2 hours flight and there are always deals on. To get here, you really need skills that can sell you in support of the financial services industry, or on the level of software dev lead. There are a lot of locals working at junior levels, but even they are being passed over for Indian and Filipino workers, who are a lot cheaper. Weird skills like 'R' programming experience, or PMP are good to have.  'Emerging markets' are where it is at for employment, but living in those places can be a bit testing. Seeing how companies operate in places like Vietnam and the Philippines mean that I am happy to be resident in SG for now.  I have holidayed in Thailand a half a dozen times or more in the past couple of years, but I have always been with somebody who has made it hard to get out whoring. I have (remarkably given my habits) never paid for sex in Thailand. Some of the Singapore brothels have Thai workers, and I got into nuru for a while, so I have had maybe 100 Thai girls, but I have never actually made it there as a sex tourist.

Aside from some light kissing she did downstairs before I got a condom on everything we did was protected.

It gets easier..   You only get what you ask for if its something really specific. Easy enough if she's doing something you really like just say, don't stop baby I love that.  I don't have a specific anything that I have to have. I can and do cum in all the positions and it changes with whom I'm with. Its fun not knowing where you'll end up. :)  I don't really care what they are wearing as long as they are comfortable. It'll end up on the furniture or floor anyway.  Sounds like a longer visit but you only got to cum once? That is unusual. Did you ask to get going again? Did she go to the bathroom and get dressed? Does her reviews reflect that she doesn't offer MSOG?  If you have a specific fetish you need to seek out ladies that are well know to provide that service. I personally don't like talking about specifics, I kind of go with the flow, and if its something like CIM, I just ask when I get close.  If its something like rimming you have to see girls that are really into it. (not my cup of tea) and you really really need to be clean."
Hookers,2yfr8w,Daty_Dato,2,Mon Mar 9 13:24:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks! The review didn't have any lies, I just didn't focus on the negatives, which were minor. Like I said, most of the ""problems"" were things just in my head. She was definitely very helpful in trying to get me a second shot, and I made that clear in my review. I just couldn't pull it off."
Hookers,2yfr8w,Daty_Dato,3,Mon Mar 9 14:06:52 2015 UTC,"I know about that all to well. I lost that ability more then a decade ago. Though trying for it, is a lot of fun :)"
Hookers,2yfr8w,gothbull,2,Mon Mar 9 14:09:40 2015 UTC,"I'm going to have to agree with Daty on the first point: these women should not be knowing your last name, and if you do have to give one, your last name is Smith, Anderson, Lee, Williams...you get the point.  Honest reviews, but don't sound overly negative.  Think of it as a performance review: write down what you thought was a problem, and if possible, how she can correct it.  If it was a mistake on your end, then say so."
Hookers,2ydiip,bluejeans90210,2,Sun Mar 8 21:40:10 2015 UTC,"A half hour of cuddling is a lot more work than giving you a 3 minute blow job and showing you the door after you shoot your load.  30 minute appointments are usually just for quick sex. Intimacy is hard work. If you want anything other than basic 'relief' then you should look at a booking of an hour or more, and look for a provider who offers 'GFE'."
Hookers,2ydiip,LOVE_YOU_SHORT_TIME,2,Sun Mar 8 22:57:46 2015 UTC,"No hate from me bro, I usually book 3 to 4 hour sessions and spend most of the time cuddling myself. I have my favorite provider who does an amazing job and she makes me feel like I'm the only guy in the world to her for those few hours. I actually think the cuddling does more good for my psyche than the actual sex does. Not to say that the sex isn't amazing, I just love holding another human being and not feeling any pressure to do something or say something. It's just her, me, and some great conversation. Pure heaven if you ask me."
Hookers,2ydiip,TheOldestProfession,1 point,Mon Mar 9 04:24:52 2015 UTC,Wish I could afford 3-4 hours...  But that sounds awesome what you have got going.
Hookers,2ydiip,slightlytainted,2,Mon Mar 9 08:49:09 2015 UTC,"I'm really really REALLY lucky to have found a provider who should be in the 400 to 500 per hour range but instead charges 300. Still expensive, but much less than the women I was seeing before her."
Hookers,2ydiip,TheOldestProfession,1 point,Mon Mar 9 14:59:22 2015 UTC,"Just ask them. You are paying for her time but yes, a BJ is different from sex. So you probably would need to pay her 30 minutes FS rate. I might just go for the BJ and talk to her about it."
Hookers,2ydiip,Daty_Dato,1 point,Sun Mar 8 23:42:10 2015 UTC,"Hey /u/Daty_Dato you seem to have good answers here. My question kinda falls inline with the op.  When is the right time to discuss ""the menu""? Before or during the time?  I posted this question to this /r but figured I'd reply outright."
Hookers,2ydiip,CallMeMuadib,1 point,Mon Mar 9 03:20:21 2015 UTC,"I took a semi-blind trip last time out. I had some idea of what was on the menu but it was far from clear. I never discussed it at all. The one thing I know is that I'm getting laid and how much the hour was. So how the sex goes only matters when I write the review. Sex is sex, so if you are there, you are going to have access to most every position. If you don't know going in assume its a cover blowjob, and hopefully you get a nice surprise. If its Greek, (anal) just assume its not on the menu.  The tricky thing is the conversation related to services for money. You never want to have that conversation until you are certain that she isn't LE. There is nothing wrong with asking before hand, but never ask about what it costs. I've noticed that many BP ads no longer mention prices. (could just be the ones that get forwarded to me as I don't surf it at all).  If there is no price then you are forced to ask. That is the tricky part.   In my mind this is such a circle jerk... I tell everyone get verified and see well reviewed ladies but that costs money and generally speaking the ladies command more per hour. Though even the BP girls end up getting rated at some point if they stick around for a few weeks. But if you are only doing a one off or rarely see ladies then I understand not spending money on getting verified. This relegates you to BP for the most part and that really isn't a place a guy with little experience should be playing.  If you know what she charges, asking what she offers before hand is fine.  If you don't you need to find that out first but then you shouldn't ask what on the menu unless you are face to face.    Avoid mixing services and money talks. If she blurts out that an hour is 250 and greek is an extra 50, you can still get busted. You might beat it court, it still isn't entrapment. (from what I've recently read) Simply by contacting her, you where not induced to commit a crime. Without the inducement it isn't entrapment and they have you. Tricky/sneaky but they count on you not fighting it. If you do, they'll probably dismiss the case if they have nothing else. And all this varies from state to state, city to city to some degree.   Are you looking for something very specific? Is it a deal breaker? I'm so easy that I wouldn't care. Like I said, I'm getting laid, it'll be good to great and I'll get off without fail. So while I enjoy specific services I'm not stuck on any one of them. I don't need something perfect every time. Without fail, the less I pay the less I get.  If you are shopping at the thrift store, you'll occasionally find a hidden gem, most of the time it's just a serviceable item.  When you shop at Bloomingdale's (random high end place) you'll almost always get a great item, rarely you'll get trash.."
Hookers,2ydiip,Daty_Dato,1 point,Mon Mar 9 04:25:12 2015 UTC,"I don't have any specific needs. I'm pretty laid back too. I just noticed mostly some girls have the rate for GFE and non GFE. I'd prefer the GFE. I guess when I make the appointment I'd say ""I'd like to see you for 1.5 hours on x day at x time"". Then at the appointment give her the donation for the GFE amount and she should ""get it"" without me telling her. And if she doesn't for whatever reason... not the end of the world."

If its shorter notice I give less time depending on how soon I need an answer. Most ladies should and do answer in a few hours if they are interested. Don't fret about her not responding there could a 1000+1 reason she hasn't. It isn't necessarily about you.

Escort service is probably going to be. XXX dollars for you to meet then what ever you negotiate with the lady after the fact. It sounds expensive to me. Far more expensive then getting verified and contacting them though the site that verified you. (P411.com) Is one that I use. Depending on your area, there with be a few to 100's of ladies they you might make an arrangement with."

Then you turn over and they start rubbing your chest, your nipples...and your balls. Of course, you'll be erect. The girls will rub your cock until it comes. Wow!  Yes. It costs twice the price of a regular one-hour massage. And you do have to tip each lady separately. But it is worth it. Just enjoy it once in your life, at least."

It is true if you google our names some items might appear but nothing like facebook, instagram, twiter, or even linkedIn. I personally feel nervous giving my information.  However for a friends B-day present we got him an escort from eros, multiple providers wanted to know all of our information, we ended up finding one that did not need all this information, she charged 500 and hr, for 2 hrs including we pay for her uber."
Hookers,2y6ycp,AussieMaleEscort,2,Sat Mar 7 00:48:43 2015 UTC,"It's not strange in USA. A lot of providers expect these details. My security and screening etc doesn't need to be as strict since I'm in the UK where escorting is legal but I'm still careful. For hotel outcalls I ask for their full name and room number so I can call them via hotel reception to their room phone and make sure they're really there and not just wasting my time. For houses, I ask them to book and pay for my taxi to their house and send me a copy of the receipt which has their name on it. I give this to someone who knows where I am and what time to expect me back and who will send the police if I disappear. For incalls I have the same security buddy system as above plus I don't give my apartment number so I can check them out before I let the in the building. Anyone who doesn't want to go along with these requirements, I don't see. Better to be safe. And if they're being argumentative at that stage, what will they be like in person?"
Hookers,2y6ycp,AussieMaleEscort,2,Sat Mar 7 18:00:18 2015 UTC,"from your standpoint it makes sense, from another standpoint from the client. What if this provider does something with this information, what if she blackmails me, call my place of work, etc."
Hookers,2y6ycp,Daty_Dato,1 point,Sat Mar 7 18:36:07 2015 UTC,"That's true. Those things could happen and I understand why you'd be reluctant to give out your personal details. There are other options like seeking out a provider who doesn't ask for these details, going to a massage parlor or brothel instead etc and I don't ask for any identifying details for incalls since I give the client's mobile number and the appointment time to my security buddy, I don't give my apartment number, check through the window by the front door that there's only one clienty looking person outside before opening the door, there's a cctv camera inside the front door etc so incalls are pretty safe without knowing their identity."

Hookers,2y3q1x,fuckthrowawayboy,2,Fri Mar 6 04:03:53 2015 UTC,"For P411, just contact (her name always escapes me) the owner, and explain it to her. There are other ways to do the screening. I'm sure she can accommodate you.   An agency is going to need to screen one way or another as well.  She's probably a good choice but the limited number of reviews would make me wait. 1 reviewer has 2 reviews, another has 4, the third many more but all of them are excellent scores. She may well be legit, but it would make me wary.   I'd like to see more reviews, I like to see guys that have many reviews with some fluctuation in the scores. A guy with that many great reviews that's seeing ladies at that price point seems really fishy. At 300 you are going to occasionally have a dud experience. Not a bad one but an average one for sure. Sometimes you just don't click with ladies for whatever reason and you shouldn't be giving her a 9 when you experience wasn't close to that.  To me that face isn't a 9 but to each their own. Looks like a 7 maybe an 8. Body looks fantastic, though I'm not a big fan of the fake funbags.   I get the desire for the GFE. I love it myself and I would want that for my first time. I would recommend finding someone with more experience and more reviews. She could be perfect, but I'd want a longer track record.   The guy with 4 reviews sounds like bullshit. The guy with multiple reviews got his dick sucked, says she's really nice. Nothing about actual sex. I'd ignore his review. Guy about 60 years old btw... The guy with 2 reviews says he's been doing this for years, and is quite detailed. Said shes great. He was the first reviewer. So he's been doing this for years, took a chance on a new agency, and selected a girl with no reviews... I'd lean bullshit.  Hey she could be fantastic. I (me) not you wouldn't take the chance if I where you. If it where me, and she was in my area, I would do her but It isn't my first go around. I'm still leery of the face, no one really commented on it (that I recall I only scanned the reviews).  You really should get VIP. Get a month and try it out. It won't break you.  Good luck."
Hookers,2y3q1x,Daty_Dato,1 point,Fri Mar 6 05:29:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks!   The issue is that I actually can't find too many great selections on Long Island on CityVibe and Eros. Do you know any other places to look? Indeed, I might just have to bite the bullet and go through P411. Hmm. I gotta think this over a bit more.   Also: Another thread on here said to not ask too many questions when setting up an appointment but I really would like it if the escort offered MSOG (since I'm new and will definitely cum like as soon as she touches me or probably even earlier ugh). Is there a tactful way to ask for this?  Thanks again."
Hookers,2y3q1x,RJFTW,1 point,Fri Mar 6 17:35:20 2015 UTC,http://eccie.net/ free to sign up but costs money to see the review details. They have separate forums for each state. You can browse through as a guest and see most of the info still.
Hookers,2y3q1x,Daty_Dato,1 point,Fri Mar 6 17:48:40 2015 UTC,Cool. Are there any more places to find escort listings though as opposed to just reviews? Not a massive amount on the sites I mentioned.
Hookers,2y3q1x,d1a8lo24,1 point,Fri Mar 6 18:59:29 2015 UTC,"Take what I said before for what it is.   The lady you selected will seem perfect to you if you get to see her. You'll need to jump through a few hoops just to get that chance.   Thinking about it, for you, I was being to critical. She isn't perfect but she'll likely give you exactly what you are looking for. Just try not to be critical, don't look for the flaws. Don't fixate on them if you happen to see them.   I see the flaws, the saggy butt, boobs, the out of date clothing, the... what ever it happens to be, but none of it matters. Providers are human being and we all come with flaws. Maybe blemishes is a better word for it. Treat them with kindness, as you should treat everyone, and it'll be a great experience."
Hookers,2y3q1x,analfuck,1 point,Sat Mar 7 03:12:14 2015 UTC,"Have you tried using google?  The only reason why a lot of people will choose a parlor instead of an escort is because you get a selection of ladies to choose from, rates may be a little lower, and most guys just love asians.  Do know that you don't just get a HJ, you can get more than that, it all depends on how much you bring.   As far as your choice and because its going to be your first time, I would go with someone with a little more reviews, you can also do a search on TER for your location and see what comes up.  Always remember review sites have a 2edge sword since there are reviews that are fake, yes that happens and also always have this in mind your experience may be different than others. So if you're an ass you will probably be treated like an ass but if you're able to click with a provider you may be surprise on what benefits you may get.  At the end of the day going to an escort and dating rely on the same principle, practice. Once you get the hang of it the sky is the limit.  In my experience women look for the following:   Confidence, a guy that knows what to do, knows what he wants and knows where he is going.   Adventurer, yes a guy that is willing to take risks and go anywhere at a moments notice and that is willing to try anything once.  Listener, learn to listen and make sure to pay attention she may test you. Don't talk too much about yourself specially if the only thing you have done in your life is to get a job.  Looking good may help a little but like someone said here having game, or just having the experience of what women want, when they want it and how they want it, will give you such an advantage that you will be the topic of the day."
Hookers,2y3q1x,Daty_Dato,1 point,Fri Mar 6 20:07:19 2015 UTC,I have never had any escort actually verify me when they said they would. Anyway it is not a big deal just go do it and get it out of your system. Also once you get laid a few times it will clear out the desperation in your body. Women can smell desperate a mile away and it is most likely why they are not going out with you. also it is not really about investing in yourself so much as it is investing in yourself to gain some game. Game is what women are into. And what I mean is do something that makes you interesting just a little. Have an edge take some risks go on a a crazy trip to a third world country. then the regular women will come around and stay around and then you will realize why we all still end up fucking hookers. but its still all good.
Hookers,2y3q1x,analfuck,1 point,Fri Mar 6 15:06:14 2015 UTC,"They may well be verifying you. You probably unaware of it. They can cross check your name, (real or fake) check your phone number, check blacklists. Yes some don't check. Most ladies actually do."

Hookers,2xycip,Daty_Dato,1 point,Thu Mar 5 00:11:00 2015 UTC,"Use logic when it comes to the internet, a site like p411 or any site that is utilize for any illegal activity can be shut down and either the police, fbi, nsa, etc... will take over those records so your information will be use if necessary plus sometimes it can become a public record.  Aside from that ask yourself this can you really trust the people on the other side they are just human like you and me and it only takes one bad apple in a bunch to make everyone else life a living hell.  Just like a few years back when a bunch of websites started to pop up with actual images and personal info of guys that were contacting escorts. The personal info included phone numbers, home addresses etc.  The info actually came from a few sites that were hack and people that had access to this info that sold it on the internet.  My advice is be careful on what personal information you provide to any site, specially when you're going to be involve in a questionable activity.    Plus is not that hard to see a provider even when they ask for references etc... most of them they really don't care and only a few will actually verify the info."
Hookers,2xycip,d1a8lo24,1 point,Thu Mar 5 23:05:43 2015 UTC,"Yes with P411 you are likely going to have to give them your real information. Though you can use a throwaway email and burner phone. LE could track you down but proving becomes more difficult and even if they do what can they prove? I've never discussed anything about sex for money on the site, just like anywhere else. I set a date they can infer it was for money but can they prove it and yes I'd fight them in court.  They for the most part don't want to know anything about you. They want to know if you have some limitation that they should be aware of. Most of the ladies never even read your profile. I'd say 1 in 4 does. (for me) though they get your request for a date, and with the number of okays I have they don't really need to look any further."

If you look at his reviews, he hasn't given out many good ones. Dickhead.  If she's on BP, and she looks legit, she'll have other ways to screen you. Just call and talk to her.  Most reviews are legit on TER. Sex is sex. Of course the reviews are going to sound similar.   We undressed. She sucked me. I licked her. We screwed in a number of positions I came I got dressed and left. That is basically what happens with a lot of variation. Some interesting things happen but I know many of my reviews are similar. It often goes the same way because that's what I like.   Mine,  She blew me, I stopped her so I didn't pop. I worked my down and did some (see username). She got on top for some CG/RCG.

I don't really mind if I get paid in 20s, 10s etc but getting handed coins would be weird (that's never happened) and i prefer if you've counted it out before you arrived so  you can just get the paying me part over with as quickly as possible rather than having to awkwardly wait while you peel off each note one by one in slow motion.

Hookers,2xpixj,deyknow,2,Mon Mar 2 20:54:20 2015 UTC,"There are two problems.  One, you're going to BP.  Two, you're black.  Don't go to BP, the place is a shithole and a half, especially for a newbie monger.  Sinn Da Truth is a provider who exclusively sees black men, as is Kacey Dash, but as far as I can tell, that's about it.  Now if your tastes run to anything that isn't black, your best options include Naughty Reviews, TER, and USASXG: personally, my go-to is Naughty Reviews, even after it's gone to shit.  Don't ask me why, it just has: I go to NR to get a face/body shot and contact info of a provider I'm interested in, then head on over to TER and USASXG for reviews on said girl.  Other options include rolling down to a strip joint like the Ace of Spades (AA-only) or Players on Eight Mile.  If you have a friend who goes to a high-end club like the Flight Club or PHC, see if they can help you get your foot in the door: they're not allowed to discriminate, per se, but they can make your visit extremely unpleasant, so be on your very best behavior.  Okay, now for the bad news, and you've probably read this before a thousand time, but if you haven't: if you're a black man looking to pay for play, you're absolutely fucked.  As Chris Rock once said in 1996, ""ig'nant ass niggas fucked it up.""  Now, I'm happily going to assume that you're a middle-ish-class college-educated black man who can support himself (and your family, if you have one) with excellent personal financial habits, quirky but adorable hobbies, a good suit or two, and a good chunk of disposable income, and I'm going to preface it all by saying 'I am so incredibly sorry hood culture fucked it all up for you.'  I'm not even joking: there are scores of well-meaning, well-established, polite, clean-cut, law-abiding (most of the time), professional black men out there living a relatively good life, and the one time they want to pay to play, some stupid motherfuckers have to screw it up so badly that an entire race is put on the blacklist.  Do a search ""no black men"" on reddit, and you'll get an idea why: providers simply cannot stand them because they do so much stupid shit, and that's not even mentioning the ""get emotionally involved with the hooker"" bit.  Read this article because it encapsulates the entire matter so well: https://maggiemcneill.wordpress.com/2010/09/18/black-men/  You're in a terrible position where a buyer's market has suddenly become a seller's market.  Providers aren't avoiding you because they hate black people, they're avoiding you because they hate gangsta wannabe thugs.  Don't be a thug.  Okay, have you taken it all in, what can you do?  For starters, be polite, be friendly, use proper English and don't sound ghetto, be professional (as in don't waste their time, don't think of the encounter as anything more than business), don't fucking haggle, dress well (not saying you have to wear a suit, but urban fashion is a big no-no), and be polite.  When you contact a provider, make sure to ask, by the way, are you comfortable a professional black gentleman?  If she's not, thank her for her time and go to the next girl on the list.  If she is, make an appointment, then do everything in your power to make sure she wants to see you again: if she has a favorite drink, get a bottle; if she has a favorite movie or TV series, gab about that shit to make a connection; and whatever you do, treat her like a lady, even when she's on her knees and sucking you off.  Hell, tip extra just to thank them for breaking the ""no black men"" rule, and if they were good for you, make a future appointment with them.  If you met them on a review site, make a review, get your name in that network, meet more whores, have more fun.  You can make this happen, but you just need to get over one big fucking barrier first."
Hookers,2xpixj,midnightyeti,1 point,Tue Mar 3 05:20:15 2015 UTC,"BTW, for black men, Naughty Reviews is invaluable as it allows you to find out what reviewers have been with the providers you're interested in.  One of the options for reviewers is looking up their race.  Sending a message to a reviewer for specifics about a provider, then networking with those guys by asking about providers who see black men is probably a good idea."

Luckily this is free here in UK on the NHS and easy to get. It can cause nausea in some people but that's  a small price to pay for not getting HIV."

Hookers,2xjkot,BigSunday77,7,Sun Mar 1 07:25:39 2015 UTC,"Look at it as an investment in good pussy.  This is how I did it.   I got a prepaid phone, pay cash. There are a lot of options, I use TracFone, Got a cheap phone and a Year card. (about 120.00 total.)  I don't use the phone for anything but hobbying. (Have a good place to hide it if necessary.)  I created a disposal email address. I now use Hushmail. I change it occasionally and just tell anyone that I want to have it, that I have done so.  Sign up for P411.  They are out of Canada, yes you'll get screened. They will check with your employment, but its fairly harmless.  This is a good way to get dates, some ladies are newbie friendly though some will ask for your personal information as well. It's up to you to determine if you feel okay to do so or not.  I then got TER so I could research the ladies. With VIP, you can see what they have done with other guys and how other guys rated their looks and services you can search your area and specific details. So if you want to see a young white spinner its easy enough to search for that. Figure out the details including her screening methods and make first contact.   Now, I mostly use TER to search for ladies. I screen for my tastes, and save the ladies to my favorites. I go over the new review list every few days checking for anyone that I'm interested in. I also view the ads, looking for ladies that are traveling to my area, and see if anyone that I want to see is running a special.  I now have a vast list of ladies that I'd see, and when the urge comes up I'll go to my lists and pick one out. Its great if they take P411 for screening, but I have another lesser used one, and I'm also willing in rare cases to give my personal information which many don't agree with. There is some risk, but I would only do it with a lady that has many reviews. The only newer ladies with few current reviews I'd see is if I recognize the reviewer or if that reviewer has a ton of reviews. A lot of very experienced guys get off on ""taking one for the team"". I let them, and if the lady turns me on, I might ask to see her. Sometimes it works out sometimes it doesn't. I always have a back up plan or 3. I try setting things up at least a few days in advance, so if it falls through I'll have time to seek other arrangements.   All of this can be paid for, for about the cost of one hour with a  highly rated lady. (for a year) It opens a lot of doors, and I've always gotten at least an average visit, usually its a good to excellent date.  There are a number of other review sites, some might be better in your area, though NY is a huge area and the ones I recommended will work well there.  Initially depending on how you go about it, it can be difficult to get dates but once you have a few okays it gets a lot easier."
Hookers,2xjkot,Daty_Dato,2,Sun Mar 1 14:15:38 2015 UTC,"Here is an easy way to do it: Get a TER account. Then post in the local forum that you are looking for a newbie-friendly provider. I have seen this done on TER, and some ladies respond. They may say that they will still screen you, but that may just involving talking first or that sort of thing.   PErsonally, I was able to see a provider without references by emailing her. I told her that I was a clean, respectful white male, and she was willing to see me."

I'd see her without reservations. Lauren I'd probably pass on. I like Milf's but she's closer to a GILF.  Though her rate here is really low and her full menu would probably get her on my list.  Victoria I'd pass on. The CBJ isn't my thing and her face is a 7 to me not that it would stop me. The CBJ would. Jewel would be a maybe. That body is smoking especially for her age but why the low ""looks"" score? She probably has a butterface. Compared to the others her rate is inflated and if I where in that area I would find someone else. In my area, her rate is appropriate to only slightly high for what she brings to the bed. She'd be a no there a maybe here.  See the ones that turn your crank and that you can afford. If your into sampling ""forbidden"" pleasures see ladies that specialize in specific services. (greek) If you haven't and want to try it, see a lady that is well known for doing it. The experience will be better.   Happy hobbying."

Don't expect it to be like a porno but it'll be a lot of fun. Try to knock off as many items on your erotic bucket list as you can.   Don't focus on one lady more then the other. Keep everyone involved even if its just stroking their arms. Much of our time was them taking turns working the D and the other riding my face. Of course much more happened but there where some menu differences which made it less then perfect. A solid 9 but not a 10 experience.

Hookers,2xcs1k,Lookingforfun81,4,Fri Feb 27 14:43:06 2015 UTC,"Every hotel has a hooker area and they are cruising the casinos looking for dates.   At night, go sit at a video poker machine and sit on the end. Sit at a dollar machine (they check these areas more) You don't have to play a lot, just sit there, playing and make eye contact with every girl that walks by. If she returns the eye contact or circles back she's a hooker. You can start talking to her, offer to by her a drink at a bar. Don't worry most of the casino's don't give a shit. It'll proceed from there. I really don't recommend discussing particulars, but you can just ask her if she wants to come to your room. She'll let you know, how she works. Almost all of them will do a CBJ. Don't pay more then a 150.00.  You just need to be on the floor from 10pm on, and you'll have plenty of options.  If your eyes are up, they'll get the message and approach you. If they ask you what your looking for just say I'm feeling lonely. It should work out. There is some risk, but rarely are they LE, don't carry a ton of cash (300 is plenty) and lock the remainder in your room safe with your other valuables before you leave your room.  Good luck. If you happen to be in the Flamingo, at night just go to the steak house, the hookers hand out there. Or the middle bar, near the main desk though they are always trying to get rid of the ladies there if they are being to obvious. If you hang there, just tip the bartender really well, he'll leave you alone. If you happen to strike up a conversation with a hooker, leave with her quickly, you can negotiate in the elevator."

If its just a bj, and you don't mind so much what the lady looks like, (for that, other then a big fat slob I wouldn't care) take a lady that isn't as attractive, even a bit heavy. They usually suck dick well and are a bit cheaper/friendlier.  Offer to buy her a drink, and proceed from there. If the money isn't an issue, I wouldn't negotiate at all. If its 200 its 200 but you might use that price to get it sans condom :) I know I would."

Hookers,2xbix0,pnwhkr,5,Fri Feb 27 04:44:47 2015 UTC,"Hookers can help you a lot if you want to learn about sex or even about making yourself more sexually attractive but a lot of us aren't that experienced when it comes to dating and relationships..   You could try I guess. Ask around different escorts in your area saying you want to roleplay flirting/asking her out on a date/making a move at the end of the night ie asking her to go home with you etc and say you are looking for na escort who has done a lot of dating who can give you some constructive criticism as well having sex with you.  The term ""alpha"" in this context is a PUA thing isn't it? If so, don't buy into all that PUA bullshit. If you treat women like tokens in a game or prey on a hunt, it will just make you into an asshole.  Talk to women like they're human beings, flirt with them/pay them compliments/find excuses to touch them in a non sexual way etc with a smile on your face like it's fun, natural and a bit cheeky. And if they smile back and seem happy about the flirting, invite them back to your place. The worst that will happen is she'll say no."
Hookers,2xbix0,AussieMaleEscort,3,Fri Feb 27 10:44:24 2015 UTC,"I really don't recommend going this route.  The simple act of getting laid, if you don't have issues with paying for it, will give you some confidence and if you do it enough times will give you become experienced. But it won't teach you how to ask a woman out, won't help you get over worrying about who a woman has slept with or how many and it isn't like having sex with most RL women. Providers don't look like, act like, move like or fuck and suck like most RL woman. They are pro's.   If you feel inadequate in the sack and that's why you don't try, it could help you get the mechanics of sex down. You might find the right provider that ""teaches"" you how to have sex, but they can't  teach you how to get over the fear of asking a RL woman to take a relationship further. They won't teach you how to socialize with women but can offer pillow talk. You could try some dinner dates with providers that will give the experience of being in public with a woman and having to socialize without them judging you. Though I think there are cheaper ways to get that experience of which I'm unaware of. Maybe speed dating. Its been decades since I've had to date anyone.  If you must and can't find it within yourself to get over your fear, look for a GFE (girlfriend experience) provider. You may need to see her for a dinner date, though many won't do that on a first ""date.""  If money isn't an issue, you may find that you like it so much you never leave, and while its a lot of fun their is little real fulfillment. Its sex for money, not a relationship. I have the relationship and do it for the sex."
Hookers,2xbix0,Daty_Dato,2,Fri Feb 27 05:44:35 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree with you. I have a bunch of girlfriends that I went out with a lot but didn't do anything with while in Europe and if I could see them again it would be really great. That's one of the things I want to do before they get older and married.
Hookers,2xbix0,Xilliah,3,Fri Feb 27 05:56:37 2015 UTC,"No.  A provider trades sex for money, not affection and charm.  It will not make you more 'alpha,' if such a thing exists.  Because the process is very simple, being with more providers will not help you get better at socializing with women because once you get past the screening process, the chances you're going to get shot down are extremely low.  It may, in fact, impede any progress you make by putting you into a hypergamous state of mind (as in ""women only want to date you because you've got money""), which is...not good.  Hookers are no more representative of women than MMA fighters are representative of men.  It will, however, help you once you get past first base.  It will also help you with...how to best express it?  Deal with women romantically, seeing sex as a chance to make her happy rather than a goal that makes you happy.  If you see a hooker to learn new things rather than get your dick wet, you discover new things about yourself, like copying porn stars when going down on a woman (tip: it doesn't really do anything) to learning how to actually go down on a woman and gaining the confidence to know that it's going to be fun almost every time you do it to a date in the future.  I don't know if I'm a sex-positive person or not, but one thing I discovered around providers is that sex is a lot of fun, and I tend not to see it as something to get but something to share.  The stuff you need to know is how to socialize with people in general.  It's not because you're too nice, it's because you're unsure of the signals these women are sending you and need to read and respond to them better.  You're being 'too nice' as a fallback.  But hey, the sex thing is fun too."
Hookers,2xbix0,eproffline,3,Fri Feb 27 05:19:39 2015 UTC,Yes. It's not about being too nice. I think it's just mainly until my mid-twenties I was so isolated that I didn't think or understand that women were interested in me. When in fact I'm probably a good-looking guy. So much time wasted it feels like.
Hookers,2xbix0,Daty_Dato,2,Fri Feb 27 05:25:05 2015 UTC,"Then you've got two confidence issues:  How to react when a woman is interested in having sex with you.  What to do to make sure she has an incredible time when you're having sex with her.  A hooker can help you with the second part from repeated exposure: the more comfortable you get around a woman's body, the more you're willing to explore, rather than let the little head take over.  (If you find a relatively honest one willing to help you out here, make that one your go-to.  I was practically trained in oral sex by one woman.)  Again, this could be a misconception on my part, but I was pretty happy when she got a real orgasm from my tongue for the first time.  Unless you can get a hooker to let her guard down so that she talks about her own experiences with men and sex off-the-clock, not so much the first.  That's a lot of trial-and-error, as well as a lot of getting shot down."

You bathe with the girl, move to the bed, have a nice time there, and then chat for a bit.  For better or worse, though, the brothels are mostly ""fish-bowls"", which means the girls sit on benches behind glass wearing numbered tags and you pick one out by number.  The one time I did it, when the mama-san called her number. the girl looked like she had won a prize: she hopped, hugged the girl next to her, and hurried breathlessly to the door to come meet me.

Glossy, shiney, magazine thread pics like that can be fake (ie pics of some model she's found online somewhere) or they can mean that she's gone to the trouble and expense of getting studio pics taken and professional photoshop work done. A photoshoot producing pics like these would cost at least £200 here. Maybe a lot more.   If you're not sure, ask her.

I have known many providers that have told me how some reviews ads on these sites were copied from TER.  Also you can get search results from a specific site through google by doing the following in google's search box:  incall new york site:theeroticreview.com  The results will depend on how much of the site is public.

I think TER has that, where as, Adultfax doesn't.  On AF, you have to update your account and pay again when your membership is out.  To each their own with this match up for payments.  If it's site design, I'd go with Adultfax on this one.  TER hasn't changed their design since they started.  I don't know if this is to cater to the elder community or if they just can't change things because of the uproar from the community if they did.  Adultfax looks to be targeting the younger and more new-age web savvy users.  I guess them being newer of a site, they can have that freedom to play around with the looks of the site.   I'd say Adultfax on this one for their design and the way you're getting your information, especially mobile.   As far as content, I'd say TER.  They've been around for years.  Not to say AF won't have as much as TER in the future, but right now, TER has more.    To comment on the one reply:  Slixa and Naughtyreviews are pretty much ad sites.   Just like cityvibe, p411, eros etc.   These are where you find the ads, Adultfax and TER are where you review."

I feel like most men want to be Doms and Asian/White/Latina can easily play the submissive part. But with Black girls, they try to run the show and are naturally more dominant."

Anyone can engage in prostitution, so there are a bunch of people out there who lack professionalism. That's why we take measures to ensure that we don't solicit those people. Now you've traumatized yourself and you don't want to see any more escorts. That's fine.

Hookers,2x1iak,_valtiel_,1 point,Tue Feb 24 22:58:44 2015 UTC,Maybe her son is a result of an escort meeting. That would mean he was born for the job. He is a pimp in training. Not a violent pimp but more like a madam pimp. You could have him fuck you up the ass while you fuck his mom from behind. Its a doggie train. Then when you both cum you could both give her a facial. She breast fed her son so I am sure she wouldn't mind his cum on her face. I bet you could watch the son do her while you jack off.

Hookers,2x02kd,AThrowaway2015,1 point,Tue Feb 24 16:20:31 2015 UTC,"So glad I work mainly in UK so I only have to worry about this kind of bullshit when I'm on tour in more backward places like Dubai and USA. My understanding is that from either the client's or escort's perspective, you're not incriminating yourself unless you explicitly agree to exchange money & sex. If it was a cop wearing a wire and trying to catch an escort by posing as a client or trying to catch a client by posing as an escort(does that really happen?) they'd need to record an agreement that sex was being paid for and money would need to change hands. If she seemed very keen to get you to say something incriminating, I'd be concerned. On the contrary she's already trying to make the ""you're just paying for my time etc"" disclaimer so I wouldn't be concerned at all. When I'm on tour in USA I don't mention sexual services in any of my ads, by txt, email, on the phone or even in person. Just a massage ad with very high rates and very escorty pictures seems to convey the right idea to clients without incriminating myself."
Hookers,2x02kd,AussieMaleEscort,2,Tue Feb 24 16:45:38 2015 UTC,"The only problem is here in the USA, especially small towns they often arrest and prosecute without much of a case. I can already see an officer pressuring me in to a guilty plea while presenting the ad, where it was posted etc to a prosecutor all the while saying he's trying to help me by dropping the fine if I plead guilty.  She did ask what I'm into sexually but I told her nothing in particular and kinda brushed it off. If she brings it back up again I probably won't follow through."
Hookers,2x02kd,TTTT27,-1,Tue Feb 24 17:13:14 2015 UTC,"A police officer CANNOT pressure someone into a guilty plea.  Not his job.  A prosecutor could pressure someone, but the defendant would have his own attorney present or that attorney would negotiate directly with the prosecutor. In fact, you don't even have to TALK to a police officer, other than to state your name and address.   And a prosecutor won't know or be able to bring up in court what ad you've responded to unless you (stupidly) told that to the police.  Also I never heard of cops targeting college students in a prostitution sting.   In short -- yes you should ""respect"" law enforcement.  But no need to be in awe of them.   And yes, there is 100% less bullshit to negotiate in a location where sex work is legal or decriminalized."
Hookers,2x02kd,Daty_Dato,3,Tue Feb 24 17:32:16 2015 UTC,Not to start an argument or anything but I once got arrested for a minor misdemeanor. When I went to court the arresting officer presented the evidence against me and said he could help me out with the fine if I pled guilty. The prosecutor seemed to be handling so many cases that I only spoke to him briefly to plead guilty or request a trial. I'm assuming a prostitution charge would be handled similarly. They also don't provide public defenders for crimes without jail time or something along those lines. I forgot what they told me.
Hookers,2x02kd,Daty_Dato,1 point,Tue Feb 24 17:47:30 2015 UTC,"Her asking for a picture is a red flag but if you didn't discuss anything but the massage, I mean nothing about sex for money. Nothing about safe sex, nothing. You are probably okay. Paying for a massage isn't illegal.  With massage ladies, always assume that its a massage only. If on the flip she offers something extra you are good to go. If you are sure and can pull it off get a hard on. She'll either ignore it, or it will lead to something extra like a HJ or more.  No cop is going to have a lady give a real massage waiting for the bust. Its to inefficient.   Cops bust massage parlors, more bang for their buck."
Hookers,2x02kd,SexyButtDaddyDom,1 point,Tue Feb 24 19:00:22 2015 UTC,In what way is that a red flag? That I might get mugged?  She explicitly said anything sexual that would occur wasn't for money. I'm not sure it would matter what she said in this context. I'm afraid by mentioning sex she made it illegal which is what caused doubt.
Hookers,2wwy4w,depurefymii23,7,Mon Feb 23 21:30:21 2015 UTC,Sounds like tantra. Just a lot of nonsense and then a happy ending. Go to a massage parlor as mentioned before.

Hookers,2wwg50,PotPotential,3,Mon Feb 23 19:23:18 2015 UTC,"Some girls don't screen well. Are you brand new or do you have P411 and an established presence on some escort sites/boards? Your status in your local pay for play community as well as P411 can reduce the amount of active screening you get. I have P411 with a good amount of OKs combined with a profile on a big hooker board with contributing reviews/membership. I haven't encountered any active screening in a long time, even well known girls will just setup the date. However I catch girls I haven't seen before or those I haven't seen in a while checking out my various profiles while they schedule.  Basically the girls can do passive screening by check your P411 & various community profiles online. Also the way you engage these ladies matters, do you sound like you know what the fuck you're doing or are you awkward? It's like if you called a drug dealer and were like ""Hey can u sell me 3.5 grams of cocaine tonight? Also is it good and what time will you be up? Could my friend come with me and get a gram too?"" It would go a lot better if you were like ""Hey, up tonight? Need an 8 if it's better this time. Swing by at 7?"". Same with setting up dates with these ladies. Some ladies will engage in explicit conversations about prices and acts, but personally I'm freaked out by that as a customer, because now they sound like they don't know what they're doing or are setting me up. The menu I'm reading should have all that info, we should never be discussing menu options and their cost.  I would be a little worried if you're a total newbie and this chick had no way to screen you. Who knows how that date will go and what else she's doing wrong. I've never used city vibe, checked it out, seems a bit backpageish. Looked in my area, didn't see too many faces I recognized,  lots of B-talent, and not as many ads as I expected considering the escort business is massive where I am. Saw lots of girls with ""no prebooking, only call when ready"" as well as overnight prices barely higher than a quality provider's hourly rate in this area. Not great stuff..."
Hookers,2wwg50,xelormy,1 point,Mon Feb 23 19:59:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd be highly alarmed and I would never see her.  This is how LE troll johns. Not that she is one, but if she doesn't have an interest in screening, even lightly, she doesn't care about her well being. Double bag it. (joke)"

I dont care. Being physically attracted to my clients is not a factor in the quality of service i provide.  As long as you are clean and respectful, you could be any shape in the world.  It matters none  Keep in mind, sexworkers dont come to work to have awesome sex with hot people.  We come to work to earn a living.    No provider is going to turn you away based on appearance, she doesnt care.  Its her job to make you feel sexy and make sure you have a fun time.  Just relax, and have fun!"
Hookers,2wuwsa,CallAnna,1 point,Tue Feb 24 22:25:51 2015 UTC,Thanks for your POV. It helps.
Hookers,2wuwsa,xelormy,1 point,Wed Feb 25 00:25:34 2015 UTC,"How out of shape we talking? If you're just overweight I wouldn't worry about it, you're not dating her, in that line of work all clients can't possibly be ""her type"". However if you're out of shape to the point of disability, I would bring it up ahead of time if it's something she's going to have to pay special attention to in order to provide her services.  Grooming wise, the most important thing the ladies want is for you to just be clean, reasonably groomed, trimmed nails, not covering up sweat with half a can of axe body spray, all normal human stuff that men who aren't total slobs can handle. Hair wise I doubt it's a big deal. With the exception of my head, chest, and pubes, I'm pretty much hairless, so I can't say for sure what you should do. Personally I do trim pubes and get my eyebrows waxed to avoid a uni-brow. If I had significant back & butt hair I'd probably do something about it. But that's just me, I don't think the working ladies care much as long as you don't show up with sweaty, smelly, out of control pubes."
Hookers,2wuwsa,xelormy,1 point,Mon Feb 23 10:25:28 2015 UTC,"Haha. Yeah. Just normal out of shape. Chubby is a good word I guess.  I might wax just to try it out, but it sounds like as long as you're normal and hygienic everything is cool.  Thanks for the insight."
Hookers,2wuwsa,AussieMaleEscort,2,Mon Feb 23 10:35:39 2015 UTC,"No problem. Wanted to also tell you that for a good first time you should look at ladies with a solid reputation and good business sense. Don't just focus on looks alone. Maybe one of the girls looks like (or even is) your favorite porn star, but it doesn't mean she knows how to handle her business. When you're a newbie you're trying to learn how all this works and if she's not a pro herself, then who the hell is driving this thing? It's going to be frustrating when you get double booked, have broken dates, misunderstandings, bad attitudes, etc... Being hot and a decent lay is a lot easier than being good at running a business, a lot of girls struggle with being self-employed.  My all time favorite girl is objectively not the hottest girl working the giant markets of Houston and Dallas, however she is absolutely gorgeous, in her late 20s, and knows how to fuck. Above all she has a SOLID rep, in around 4 years she's amassed well over 500 reviews with only one negative rating. That's quite a feat in any service oriented business. I see other girls too, but much less frequently than her, because honestly even though the 22 year old barbie dolls here are stupid hot, it's rarely as much fun and there's too much nonsense and unprofessional behavior going around.   A girl that can handle her business will make the whole process easier for you, after all, you're the customer. She should have a well written ad with clear pricing, screening requirements, menu and limitations, with a strong reputation in the form of many good reviews. Focus on that first, then you can start to whittle it down via various physical criteria. Good communication is really important, she should be reasonably responsive, assuming her ad is well written you shouldn't have much to ask except when she's free. She's going to screen and setup a date. Then you shoot her a follow up to confirm the day of, she shouldn't need reminders in the days between. Really it could be less than 10 text messages in total between setting up the date and getting the room number when you get there if everyone knows what the fuck they're doing."
Hookers,2wuwsa,xelormy,1 point,Mon Feb 23 11:23:25 2015 UTC,"Excellent advice. If you can book an appointment with a minimum of fuss, turn up on time, pay and be clean and polite, you're a perfect client.  If the first message you send mentions, a day, a time and whether you want an incall or outcall, all escorts will assume you're most likely genuine. If you send more than a few messages asking sexual questions without mentioning any of the above, most escorts will assume you're just some sad hermit so desperate for human interaction, you're pretending to be a client so escorts will play along with your fantasies while you wank."
Hookers,2wuwsa,Livenude,1 point,Mon Feb 23 13:50:46 2015 UTC,Great advice. Thanks again.  Any advice on referrals for a first time?

Hookers,2wuwsa,MrLutareio,1 point,Tue Feb 24 07:15:17 2015 UTC,"Go for P411, it's a good service for someone new starting out. She gets to see that you're verified but doesn't do the verification yourself. You just need to find a newbie friendly provider to start with when you have p411."

Hookers,2wlmzl,iknownothing101,3,Fri Feb 20 23:19:10 2015 UTC,"You need to do more research. The first lesson of this hobby is that Asian massage parlors rarely advertise with real pictures. They just post pictures of models. Depending on the place, the real girls there are going to be much older.   If you're doing Asian massage, you might want to look on Rubmaps or similar. Personally, I paid for membership for a different site (not rubmaps, but I was more interested in escorts) so I can gather all the info first. You need to find the review site that serves your area and join (at least a free membership) and gather the info. If you're not willing to throw away 40 bucks or at least do a fare bit of research, your experience is really gonna be hit-or-miss (and there will be more likelihood of encountering a bad situation, such as law enforcement). You could always go to these places to see what's up, but there's a good chance you're going to get a massage from a 40 year old woman, and you'll have to play it by ear as to what happens next.   But in short, nobody here knows if those places are OK (what are you seeking? A handjob? You need to do your research to know what is offered)."
Hookers,2wlmzl,cp9406,1 point,Fri Feb 20 23:31:35 2015 UTC,"No i am trying to fuck a hooker, I just thought that was insinuated at those Asian massage parlors.

Hookers,2wlmzl,redandfeed,3,Fri Feb 20 23:43:01 2015 UTC,"Only a reckless person responds to backpage ads without researching any further. This is the U.S. - prostitution is illegal and the police are looking to make easy busts. They setup stings all the time.  You can use backpage to find women you're interested in, but the only way you'll know if their pictures are real and that they're not going to try to rip you off is if you research them on another site. You do that by Googling their phone number to find reviews, using tineye to reverse image search to see if they have a history or if they're suddenly and mysteriously new (that's a sign that something's not right), or going directly to third party sites and finding their reviews.   You have to read reviews of them. What if you go there and the girl says it's 300 dollars and then she gives you a fully clothed massage and says ""that's what you get for 300. Let me know if you want to do anything else."" What if you go there and it's not the girl in the pic. That happens ALL the time. Girls don't want to put up pics of themselves for obvious reasons, so they find a pic of someone that's hotter and they put that up. And then they swear their pics are real (ALL of those fake Asian ads say ""real pics! no fakes!"").  Recently I've been looking at Backpage, and I've been finding girls that are totally my type. And I do my research and find they're real. But then the reviews say things like she smelled like cigarettes, her room was a dump and she just laid there.   Anyway, maybe you should just give it a shot and see how it goes. The best reviews are the ones where the guy took a risk and had some incredibly bad experience a because he was thinking with his little head. Let us know."

Not sure who you see if you went to meet her, but it's doubtful it would be the girl in the pic.   The brunette doesn't seem to be using stolen pics.   Neither of their phone numbers turned up anything when googleing them.   If you're going to use BP, you should learn how to use Google Image Search or TinEye to check the pics. You should also always google the phone number. Hopefully that will return some reviews, but doesn't always even on legit girls."

Wearing protection is the absolute golden rule when doing this sort of thing. Avoid anyone who barebacks or has barebacked in the past, and don't ever even consider participating in it yourself.  For the sake of peace of mind it may be worth getting checked, AIDS/HIV takes a little while before it shows up in tests though. If you are in the UK the nhs runs various drop in std clinics where you can go through various different tests without a prior appointment, such as the Dean street express in London. But I don't know how things work stateside or elsewhere in the world.  Never bareback. It's the stupidest fucking idea in the world, think with the big thing in your head, not the little thing dangling between your legs."

Actually, if I'm being honest, I would keep going back and start giving her a fake name and use a burner number.  About the STDs, your odds are low for something as serious as HIV. So low that it shouldn't be a serious worry for you. Chlamydia and similar infections are higher, but completely curable. Herpes is the one I always worry about.

Given that if she had it your odds of contracting HIV are about 1/2,000, and that she probably only has hiv maybe 10% of the time at the maximum, you're looking at like a 1/20,000 chance of having that.  Pretty damn small and nothing to be overly worried about.  The real worry is pregnancy.  What are the chances that you knocked her up and she will actually go through with a pregnancy?  That is hard to a lot harder quantify.  Still definitely low.  Go out and get tested in 3 months for HIV.  Come up clean and then never hear anything about this again.

For me, I said to myself ""I've paid for 60 minutes and there's 30 left. Lots of time. I'm just going to blank for something like 25 and see what happens.""

After a five minute break, my penis is less sensitive, and I can usually get off the second time around from a handjob only.  Sometimes I ask them to sit on my face so I can enjoy the view. Sometimes I ask them to sit between my legs so they can focus on the cock massage. Sometimes they sit next to me and put their tits in my face. Each of these has produced good results.

Hookers,2w7rij,malibijones,15,Tue Feb 17 18:02:28 2015 UTC,You asked a female subreddit about hookers?  Why?  Were you expecting a thought provoking debate that would give you insight into how women think?  Well.. you know what think now.  Keep it to yourself.  Most females will take your questions as either degrading or bragging about conquests.
Hookers,2w7rij,antonivs,1 point,Tue Feb 17 20:01:16 2015 UTC,"Actually, most of the responses were perfectly reasonable.  OP seems to be looking for validation for his own idiocy.

You mention you have a problem with lying, but I'd say that omission isn't really the same as dishonesty. I'm sure there are things partners in the past never told you, and vice versa, and IMO  that's rightfully so. Some things are just left better unsaid."

Also as I have stated many many many times in the past I married a former prostitute and it has turned out to be pure bliss as far as what I see most marriages turn into. And yes I picked her up after fucking her friends so she knew I fucked prostitutes. Also I learned from looking at this post that I am banned from Askwomen...."

Hookers,2w4syv,flatoutfree,6,Mon Feb 16 23:45:43 2015 UTC,I got to the part where you asked for my email and left.  I'm not using my memorized user login/pwd for a relatively unknown site where I can't even get a look at what I'm getting into. Your average user will stumble onto your front page and ask themselves why bother? You have no idea what you will get out of the site.  For my own safety with a site like this I would have to create a unique user login/pwd and I would likely forget it in a couple minutes.  Adultfax lets you use the site and see a lot of features before you have to login. This provides value to the signup process. Maybe try something like that.

Hookers,2w4fmp,Quaternions,1 point,Tue Feb 17 19:41:22 2015 UTC,"Agencies normally use canned ads.  Yeah, they might change up the pictures of the girls from time to time.  This is one of the reasons I don't go to an agency.  I want the girl in the picture, and the chances of getting her is probably not that great if it was an agency.  However, on the positive side, if you know the girls name, you can call and request her in advance.  If she isn't available, they should tell you when she will be available.  They want the business, so they are usually pretty reasonable."
Hookers,2w2hyn,TTTT27,3,Mon Feb 16 12:02:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, people get busted for this.  And nowadays, men are at least equally likely to be busted as women.   If you want to know all the details, go here for a link to a 245-page PDF of a Department of Justice funded study on prostitution reduction law enforcement strategies.  Really an infuriating report - it gives lip service to the fact that many believe sex work should be legal, yet describes providers in terms like ""prostituted woman"" and clients as ""johns"" or worse.   The good news is that sex work is incredibly dynamic and quickly adjusts around attempts to eliminate it.  The parts of this industry that most likely to be busted are the lowest, street-level activity.  The bad news is that some law enforcement basically want to become pimps themselves.  For example, the report describes how a brothel or individual sexworker could be ""rescued"" and ""removed from the situation."" Then, police use her phone or location to arrest clients who later show up.   Remember, men and women, you have rights.  If arrested do not speak or say anything to police other than your name and that you want a lawyer.  You are unlikely to actually be prosecuted for consensual sex work if you do this and have not actually agreed to exchange sex for money."
Hookers,2vy720,Capite,10,Sun Feb 15 06:01:16 2015 UTC,"Remember, with the exception of some counties in Nevada, prostitution is illegal in the United State.  You should look up your local laws concerning prostitution and determine if you are willing to live with the consequences if you are caught.  In most places, it is a misdemeanor.  Getting caught usually comes with some public shaming (name published in the local newspaper) and a fine, but at least  you won't have to answer ""Yes"" to that question on a job application ""Have you ever been convicted of a felony?""  Before You Start:  Research, Research, Research  Before starting you should spend some time researching.  There are plenty of sites out there that will go into this.  I suggest you join a site like USA Sex Guide Forum.  It is a forum for like minded individuals.  The forums are broken up according to geographical areas.  Here is the link for Cincinnati, OH.  Each forum is broken down by Massage Parlors, Backpage reviews, CL reviews, streetwalkers, general information, etc.  Word of warning though, you will have to be an active participant on the forums before people will send you direct information about a provider.  Search the forums, read past and present posts, spend time getting to know what information has been already given.  People aren't just going to start interacting with a newbie because you could be a LEO.  I would join a site like TER (The erotic review), and see what is available around your area.  As a member you can see reviews of providers.  Pay attention to the dates of the reviews, you will want to make sure the reviews are current.  Chances are, providers with old (3+ months old) reviews are either not operating in your area, or not in the business any more, or possibly got nicked.  If you plan on using a classified site like backpage or craigslist, then google, google image and the Tineye addon will be your friend.    Before contacting any providers, you should google their phone number.  See if the number pops up for adds that has a different girl on them.  If multiple girls are using the phone, it could mean a couple of things:  exactly that, multiple girls are using the same phone.  You'll find that some girls will work in pairs (you'll see ads containing 2 girls action within them) for protection.  It could mean that it is a pimp controlling the girls, or it could mean it is LEO.  If the result only shows the girl in question, then that is a good indicator that she may be legit.  Use addons like Tineye and Google Images to search the photos.  A good indication that the add may be fake is that they will use photos of a porn star, or another provider that is consistently advertising in another area.  Or it could just mean that the provider is either ugly or fat and wants to try to lure mongers to her door with them.  In any case, seeing the photo search results with tons of results is a red flag, proceed with caution.  Know the Terms  If you don't know what BBJCIM, YMMV or AMP mean, then you should familiarize the terms.  Most review sites will tend to use terms or abbreviations.  Check the site, they normally will have a terms/abbreviation meaning page for you.  In general these terms are universal, but there may be some site specific.  Contact:  Taking the Plunge  Escorts: - Okay, so you've done some research and you are ready to contact an escort you have found.  If you haven't figured it out yet, but incalls are where you go to the provider (usually a hotel room, but sometimes a private residence) and outcalls are where they come to you (again, usually a hotel room, or your own place).  I personally only do outcalls and I use a hotel room.  I don't anyone knowing where live.  When calling the provider, never, never, never say anything explicit.  Usually the provider will hang up on you and block your number.  This is common sense, but there are some seriously stupid people out there.  Don't be one.  Asking ""What do you charge?"" or ""How much is the donation?"" etc are fine because you could be talking about getting a hair cut.  But don't say something stupid like ""How much extra for anal?""  In most cases, the provider will use a two or three call system.  You call initially to set up the appointment and they'll give you a general location (like a motel) and then ask that you call them again.  There's reasons for this.  Usually when you call the second time, they will look out the window and scan the area for you.  If they find you and like the looks of you, they'll give you their final location and ask you to come up.  Sometimes a provider will ask you to call once you get there and then ask you to call again in 10 minutes.  This is usually because they have someone roaming to check your out instead of doing it themselves.  Keep your eyes open when you are sitting in a parking lot calling the provider.  If you spot anything that makes you uncomfortable, then bail.  It is better to waste some time and having to go home to jack off rather than get yourself in a potential dangerous or uncomfortable situation.    Streetwalkers - Street mongering is a completely different ballgame and much more risky.  That is usually why mongers do it, the added thrill.  I only dabble in street mongers, so instead of providing an entire guide on it here, I'm going to link it instead.  If you are considering street mongering, then you need to read this guide and any other guide you find know them by heart.  Otherwise you'll end up getting nicked, robbed or worse.  22 Rules for Street Mongering .  Asian Massage Parlors or Regular Massage Parlors - You'll end up spending more at a MP because you are not only paying for sex, but also for the massage.  Most places that provide the ""extras"" will have a initial door charge ($60/hr) and then the extras (can be up towards an additional $200).  Check out various review sites to get a better idea of the prices for MPs around you and whether or not the massages are worth a damn.   I have a favor AMP where I always ask for one of two girls, because not only are they extremely sexy, but they give one damn good massage.   Again, if you go this route, never initiate anything, let them do it.  If they initiate it and you are comfortable, then accept.  If you aren't, respond with something like ""I'm not sure what you mean?  I only came here for a massage.""  Well I hope this helped.  I'm sorry for the wall of text.  Be safe and enjoy yourself.  You are about to enter a world of wonder."

The cuckolding part of the question is interesting. Do I enjoy the idea of her sleeping with other guys? Yeah, sometimes the idea arouses me. Do I love other guys checking her out? Yep. Do I want her to take a bull and never fuck me again? Hell no! Am I a Cuck? I don't know, do I need a label? I like some parts of that fetish but strongly reject other parts.  Who's the dominant one? Her in the bedroom, me outside. She's good at acting. If I want to be dominant in bed, she can act submissive but her natural position is to be dominant with me. She knows what she wants and isn't afraid to get it."

Hookers,2vqbpw,pretentiously,1 point,Fri Feb 13 07:06:46 2015 UTC,"She can make anywhere up to a few thousand dollars in a night, depending how many clients she sees.

She tends to earn a bit less than this. She has no plans of retiring any time soon but she knows that I will support her whenever she chooses to."

Hookers,2vqbpw,mentallimit,2,Fri Feb 13 22:18:10 2015 UTC,Yeah it can be pretty irregular work. Also there is a lot of local competition from Asian women who are constantly trying to undercut local women. Around major events she can put up her prices and still be booked out. At other times she may have to drop prices to be competitive.

I imagine she'd not be super excited about sex after a grueling day."
Hookers,2vqbpw,SlutsLOL,2,Fri Feb 13 22:29:21 2015 UTC,"It can disrupt our sex life. If there's a big event event in town and she's seen a large number of clients, she's probably not going to want to come home and have more sex. In other ways, we have a much richer sex life than I've had with any previous partners. I don't see it as different to any other couple. Sometimes ex girlfriends would come home from work stressed and not be keen for sex."

It's more of a safety concern to the provider, but there might be a slight elevation in risk to you due to increased chances of encountering blood. Obviously, a condom is a must.  If you're looking for anal like you see in porn (i.e. you fuck it just like it's a pussy), you might be disappointed. I've had anal sex with a few girls and so far it's been very slow and gentle, and it still seemed like they were in pain, which is a turnoff (at least to me). Not a lot of girls can take an anal pounding with a smile on their face, so do your research and find a provider who is known for good Greek."
Hookers,2vqnj5,zenspeed,2,Fri Feb 13 06:52:22 2015 UTC,"In addition, if you've got to have it, do it with a provider you know already.  The first time I gave it a go, I was with a favorite, so she knew I would be coming back for more."

Hookers,2vgmwc,caculo,1 point,Fri Feb 20 15:04:51 2015 UTC,"Do what you want, but I have never met one single guy who said, ""For my first experience, I went to a hooker, and it was awesome.""  Most are more like, ""That was it?  That was what everyone was so excited about?""  As someone with experience in the cash-for-gash arena, I think the problem is two-fold:  First, I think you (or at least people in your position) have an inchoate expectation that prostitution will somehow ""break the logjam"".  You feel you are like a college graduate who cannot get a job because he lacks experience but cannot get experience  because he cannot get a job.  Sorry, prostitution won't solve any of the problems you actually have.  It won't make you comfortable around women, it won't teach you to attract women or be a good lover to them, it won't make you feel like ""a regular guy"".  Second, it's difficult to find a good hooker.  The majority of prostitutes are either struggling with problems of their own (typically addictions), or (and I hate this) clinging to complex and misandrist theories about how prostitution is a way for them to exert power over men.  If you had experience with women, you could exercise a certain amount of control of the situation: you could get what you wanted because you knew what that was and you had what she wanted (the money).  As it is, though, you are at the mercy of someone who certainly does not have your best interests at heart and who is probably not particularly professional about her work.  Finally, with any prostitute, her time is very valuable.  You know nothing of the mechanics of sex and it would take you weeks to become at all skilled at it.  Regardless of how ""patient"" she might be, there is just no way you could afford it.  My suggestion instead: read /r/seduction -- try not to get sucked into the pretty widespread misogyny there and avoid their obvious and tired games, but learn how to conduct yourself so as to appear confident and attractive."

Having sex isn't something you get out of your system. It is in our DNA to have sex. You will just want to do it all the time. You should wait to find a girl you are in love with. There is a major difference in fucking to get off and making love. Having sex with someone you are in love with is one of the greatest experiences in life. Do you want to have to tell your future wife you lost your virginity to a hooker? If you don't tell her, then what kind of relationship is it without trust and openness?

Hookers,2v52ql,amsterdayyum,7,Sat Feb 7 23:49:32 2015 UTC,"There are a number of brothels in Amsterdam. These are a much better deal than any window. For around a third more than a 'one shot and done' deal at a window, you get an hour at a brothel.  It has been too long since I was there for me to make any specific recommendations, but they all operate the same. You get past the bouncers, and then there is a bar/lounge where you hang out and approach, or are approached by girls. Once you make a choice, you pay a house fee, which should cover FS, but occasionally the house fee and girl fee are separate. All should be clearly explained up front.  The girls on average are a cut above the windows, and are far more service oriented. It is normal for clients to hang out and have multiple sessions, and it generally is a lot nicer and more comfortable to negotiate sessions when you don't have a dozen tourists watching you.  There are also the usual 'private' and agency escorts, but they are very hit and miss, especially if you are in a new city and are not in contact/have a language barrier with the local review community.  Hanging out and having a few sessions in a European brothel/FKK is an excellent way to spend an afternoon. It is like being a member of a private club that has a branch in every city on the continent."

If you took a trip to, say, St. Petersberg or Thailand or Colombia you could get a girl all night for like 100-200 dollars.  So unless you really don't want to travel and see another country (which has its own benefits) then I really would consider this option instead."

I am asian and so is the escort, just not into white girls. How many asians girls do you see that tall ever? I'm into the experience, and also the things I will be able to do since one downside to being tall is the lack of exotic positions in bed if I were shorter and be able to do more fun positions."

Hookers,2ucyur,zjciprazz,11,Sun Feb 1 00:46:13 2015 UTC,"Your friend in LE is full of crap.  Lots of people go to Thailand, no one gets ""flagged"" for anything unless they have been arrested for something bad in Thailand.  Realize that Thailand is a different culture with its own rules and norms.  There's a lot of great things about the Thais - they are very accepting of sexual minorities, few hang-ups about sex, and very accepting about sex work in general.  But don't go to Thailand just for sex.  You can get it a lot closer to home, if that's all you want.  There are a lot of dumb Western tourists who go to thailand and sometimes they get scammed.  Not too hard to avoid scams, mostly common sense that will make your overall trip a lot easier.  Research what you are doing and where you are going before you go there.  Don't get involved with illegal drugs, they are definitely not tolerated.  Stay sober, or at least don't get so inebriated you become vulnerable.  Remember if it sounds too good to be true, it is.  Learn the skytrain and public transportation system; it is a lot easier and cheaper than taxis.   And have fun.  Thailand is a great place."
Hookers,2ucyur,TTTT27,0,Sun Feb 1 06:09:32 2015 UTC,"The one in LE wasnt even my friend, it was a friend of a friend. I'm certainly not just going for sex, I'm planning 2 weeks there, half the time on a beach, the other half in the city. During the day I'll do all the tourist stuff, and during the night I'll hit up the bars to party. I'm just trying to learn what to expect when it comes to the nightlife."
Hookers,2ucyur,throwawaybrago,5,Sun Feb 1 15:37:43 2015 UTC,"This is what you'll see in the Thai nightlife, there are bars, beer bar complexes, clubs, and a gogo's (generally).  Beer bar complexes are usually an open area filled with small bars, the girls working in the bars will try to drag in you by hollering, taking your hand and pulling you in or even jump up and straddle you.   In a bar a girl might come up to you being all flirty and ask you to buy her a ladydrink (she might actually be attracted to you but don't count on it, she will flirt with you all the same), the lady drinks are a bit higher priced drinks that the girls are required to sell or get a cut out of selling. If you want to take her with you beyond the bar you will have to pay a bar fine, this is because the girls leave the job in the bar and going with you instead, the bar fine will be somewhere between 300-1500 Baht depending on the place and the girl, and you can take her short or long time (prices depend wildly) and sex is more or less a sure thing, up to you as they say in Thailand.  A gogos are more or less a strip club, with full or partial nudity packed with girls, some clubs try to put on more of a show and others might look like a brothel way past its heyday with old girls doing the Bangkok shuffle on stage, some a gogos are a bit seedier with fisting shows and ping pong shows or where you're given a dildo to use on the girls, this varies wildly. Drinks will cost more, lady drinks are sold here as well and the bar fines will be higher. I recommend you visiting one as it can be fun, there are no cover charges so it's ok to poke your head in and turning on the spot if you don't like the place, no one will care.  Clubs are like all night clubs, loud music, blinking lights and dancing, they're a common place to find a freelancer, they are self employed and no bar fine is required and these girls will range from old cankled hags to playboy models, they will command a price thereafter (if you're a good looking young stud she might just like you and quote you a lower price, it's up to the girls.  The thai nightlife scene isn't compex but there a lot of things going on, rules that you will learn while on the ground, and there's much more going on than what I'm botheed to write in this comment, just don't be an asshole, get overly drunk or treat the girls badly and everything will be ok.  One last thing, I've been describing the sex trade part of the nightlife but there's much more to it, never assume that a girl is working, there are parts where the sex trade is more concentrated but in other parts of town it will be regular thais just out having fun, so talk to girls as much as you want without assuming she will sell you her services but nonetheless don't be surprised if she asks money of you, the line can be quite fine.  Oh, and on the subject of lady boys, they are common. Learn how to spot them and if you're unsure just ask. Most ladyboys won't lie about it but here are some tips that I've picked up. They are usually easy to spot, look for unusually large hands, adams apples and a marked brow line, the brow line and adams apple can be surgically altered but the hands and feet can't, lady boys also tend to go for western beauty so if you see a girl that looks like Katy Perry and Kate Upton had a daughter she might be a ladyboy, not to mention the rock hard boobs."
Hookers,2ucyur,throwawaybrago,0,Sun Feb 1 17:32:26 2015 UTC,"Are there any laws I have to be careful about? My mom mentioned to me not to try and smoke weed while I'm there; she said I'd be in a Thai prison the rest of my life if I got caught. Thats part of what made me nervous about the underage girls thing. I'm worried if I'm in the bar complex and there are girls freelancing who are 16 or 17, that I'm taking the chance of getting arrested and being labeled a child sex tourist if I pick them up, without even realizing they're underage. Of course I'll be staying away from any obvious kids, I have no interest in that. I'm just worried about the ones who are in the jailbait category."
Hookers,2ucyur,cherobics,3,Sun Feb 1 18:31:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, stay away from drugs. You won't be put away for life if they catch you with cannabis but stronger stuff might, the very least the police might try to blackmail you into giving them hundreds of thousands of baht. But the military have been cracking down on corruption and it seems to be working somewhat.  When it comes to the risk of underage girls, I've only met one under age girl that worked in a bar and she plainly said ""No I can't go with falang, too young, only 17"". I've actually never even given it a second thought. If you stay at a good hotel the front desk will hang to the girls ID so you can check it when the girl hands it over."

I will tell you this. If a girl tells you she is going to ""dance""  for you, and then has her friends start dancing as well...  immediately pay your tab and leave. It's a pretty common scam where you are expected to pay for their dancing time, and I've known folks to get hit with bar tabs in the range of hundreds of dollars. Also, beware of any guy standing in a tourist area trying to get you to a certain bar or show....  That is usually a scam as well."

It is completely safe and nothing bad will happen to you - but it is quite spendy.  Also do the western scene at nana/patpong/etc.  The experiences are very different.  You can also try G clubs.  Doing this will allow you to figure out for yourself which you like more.  If you're on a tight budget you can hit up cheaper places, too, like Nataree... and skip g clubs.  The girls aren't as hot the cheaper you get though.  You get what you pay for like everything in life.  Thailand is quite safe (well except for riding motorbikes).  This is probably a case of a guy that hasn't been in Thailand very long writing on a subject he is clueless about, or worse, someone that has been here a long time but never tried to actually go anywhere else other than a few key bar areas.

Hookers,2ucyur,Mingalablah,2,Sun Feb 1 01:29:52 2015 UTC,I was wondering about the motorbikes; is that something a tourist can even do without a Thai drivers license? And that being said I guess your advice is to not even try?
Hookers,2ucyur,0xE2,2,Sun Feb 1 14:04:12 2015 UTC,"Well yes, you can rent and drive motorbikes in Thailand, but when we say motorbikes we mean mopeds, these are 125-250cc scooters that are common in Asia.  An international drivers license is all that you need, but people drive quite aggressively over there so it is risky, going the wrong way is common as is drunk driving. Motorbikes are also used as taxis and the drivers will wear high vis wests and hang around the touristy areas waiting for a fare."
Hookers,2ucyur,totes_meta_bot,2,Sun Feb 1 16:49:21 2015 UTC,"Well i consider myself a pretty good driver, i work in NYC and i frequently drive cars and trucks in manhattan. i consider that to be a pretty aggressive environment for driving in. And a moped would be fine with me. It just feels like a great way to be able to explore.

Hookers,2ucyur,YourMomsPoopCarrot,3,Sun Feb 1 16:58:47 2015 UTC,"Do it but stay safe, wear a helmet and be very aware of your surroundings. Most thai drivers doesn't respect the rules of the road as we do in the west, the sentiment is ""If I'm supposed to die on the road today it will happen, mai pen rai"" I've been to NY three times and I would describe the driving as hectic but not aggressive (in comparison) people honk their horns and curse but you'll never see a pickup truck filled with children going 50 the wrong way or mopeds driving on the wrong side on the New Jersey turnpike.

Just realize that it is actually dangerous - the most dangerous thing you will do in Thailand.  Like the decision to ride a motorbike is definitely a lot more dangerous than, say, choosing to not wear a condom.  What I guess I am getting at is don't be a complete idiot like so many tourists are when it comes to motorbikes.  Don't drink and ride one and don't drive too fast.  I am guilty of the latter but it is definitely stupid of me.  Edit: to put this in perspective, Thailand has the second highest traffic fatalities in the world.  You don't really need a license, thai or international.  Just wear a helmet and the police will leave you alone.  If you do get caught up with them the fine for not having a license is laughably small at 400 baht last time I checked, might have gone up a little but it won't be a big deal."

Hookers,2u9udk,manwhore25,3,Sat Jan 31 06:59:01 2015 UTC,"I suspect this happens more often than we all think.  I've heard a lot of examples of providers and clients becoming friends.  I've also heard of providers who offer to continue seeing a favorite client for free but he insists on continuing to pay her, enjoying the companionship but wanting to keep the arrangement professional.  Be happy that you have found a client you really click with and that the feeling seems to be mutual.  Can't offer any personal advice, but I'd say to take things slowly.  The place where trouble could start is if he expects that, because he's dating you, you should see only him and not other clients.  But if you want to stay in your line of work, and he is OK with you doing that, and he's willing to stay out of your dealings with other clients, then perhaps you could explore taking things to another level."

ANYWAY now that my cred is out there :D  http://std.about.com/od/gettingtested/f/Positive-Herpes-Igm-Recent-Herpes-Infection.htm  http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2013/07/order-herpes-igm-blood-test.html  http://www.earthclinic.com/cures/genital_herpes.html  I learned from a lady of the night that had been in biz for 45years (that was a few years back) that she still did bare stuff at the brothels she worked at, in fact, everyone did. Do the math, this was around fucking AIDS and such. She married had plenty of children, is a happy grandmother now as well. RAW APPLE CIDER VINEGAR douche with that before and after sex and apparently it just tends to work.  Now, personally, I reserve that form of getting down for my S/O, BUT I am a traditional gfe type of lady. My routine before I makeout or play with anyone else? Hold racv soaked cottonballs to mouth area and splash into face (it, WILL burn it is an acid but is not damaging and evaporates you can fan your eyes and keep em shut for a while till the stinging on the rest of your face isnt so strong) rinse with water and rinse my mouth with a shot of it straight. Yes, it is sour as fuck, yes it kinda burns BUT it closes abrasions and shrinks pores while disinfecting your skin with its natural PH (skins oils tend to be on the acidic level, this is what keeps me looking young as well)  Then I get a mix of the racv with bottled water and I am good to go. (lady bits are highly acidic, gals that do this always have a nice scent/taste and in Mexican hookers swear thats what keeps their grip over the years and plenty johns)  BOOM, have not tested + for anything while in this. I have really good insurance, like, I can go in there whenever I feel like for 10 bucks and I dont usually have to pay for tests or meds. When I went in there after my first month as a massage lady, I was nervous coz I am an artist and get cuts on my hands and obvi there was a release that I did without gloves sooo.... Anyway, I was like doc screen me for EVRYTHING (had a shite bf atm that didnt know) she went down the list and there was not HSV test, I was like dude you fail at your job.... She just laughed ""No actually I dont recommend those anymore, just because the testing for it right now is not all that great or reliable"" then went to explain the history of HSV (discovery etc, basically herpes was a gross word to describe something that our fore fathers didnt see as anything more than a bad case of acne) and that it only manifests when you put yourself through fucked up stressful situations especially if you eat more on the processed gross side because nutrition CAN damage your immunological response to a virus that we ALLL literally have! Chicken pox? HERP Small pox? HERP That crazy shit where you essentially turn into a tree coz of the way the sores grow? HERP   A stigma and therefore a really gross and kinda sketch medicine were then hand in hand to give our younger generations fear of casual sex and/or GEE WILIKERS fuckin with them ""nasty hookers"". Its a thinly veiled population control project, not surprising at all to me really but definitely not FOOL PROOF. There are hippie kids like me that end up figuring out that a great natural and (if you can) organic diet along with the addition of diotomaceous earth to the diet is a great way to not just stay overall healthy but maintain my phobia and deep mistrust of ""regular"" docs methods and scripts...  Anyway, the best thing would be to tell her of the findings and say listen I could have gotten it before I met you and the test not come out right when we tested when we were monogamous. Then add the whole stress thing, if you have been LEGITIMATELY stressed this is your time to really harness that. Also, maybe perhaps start at some point talking about being in an open relationship? Why lie to someone that went and disfigured her body for you to have the children I am assuming you like? We as women (or maybe I am speaking for myself her) quite frankly dont give a fuck about the sex, the resorting to lying is what fucks us up. If you are reading this before telling her, consider this as a free pass this one time from a woman/hooker that will take your word for you being a stand up guy. Please be real with your woman, and let her have fun with life too, do you seriously think that she isnt a sexual animal somewhere deep inside that just wants to be awakened? Let her explore that, you surely went and explored the hell out of your treats ;-)   To all people involved in the adult industry:  Do it because you love it  Deceive no party as often as possible (especially yourself)  Be responsible every day with your body, keep it nourished (not over fed not under fed not with many synthetic chemicals)  Share your body in responsible ways (guys can use vinegar for prepping themselves as well, it burns, but it is something that must be done to keep yourself safe I would put it all over pubic area or ass depending on what you like)  Have an amazing time and be like normal regular friends (at least, that is my niche)  Feel free to PM me if you would like more help, ok? Take care everyone! _^"

Hookers,2u43w8,MrLutareio,3,Fri Jan 30 00:20:16 2015 UTC,Excellent post. Here's my input:  Spain is expensive for escorts. Germany and Amsterdam are better alternatives in Western Europe (50 euro). Eastern Europe is a lot cheaper but the language barriers are tough.   In Hong Kong you get what you pay for. Most of the girls are from the mainland. The girls on 141 sites sometimes have photoshopped pics or pics from when they were young and thin. It helps if you have a friend who can speak Mandarin.  In Thailand the price varies a lot depending on location. In the big tourist cities like Bangkok and Phuket you're looking at 500 baht for the barfine plus an additional 2000-3000 baht for the girl. In some place like Udon Thani it can be as low as 300 baht total.
Hookers,2u43w8,hookers2015,2,Thu Jan 29 23:52:33 2015 UTC,Is it safe to go to Colombia though? I've heard some pretty scary things about travelling to Venezuela for example.

Hookers,2tz6x6,MadMan2012,7,Wed Jan 28 16:44:42 2015 UTC,"Hi there, Hookerthrow at your service.   Just mention you saw her ad on (such and such website) and you would like to schedule a (insert length of time) meetup with her. Thus the price is understood and not much needs to be said as most initial phone calls need to be short and to the point. This is up to you, some will say yes and some will say no. I, personally, did not on my 1st time. I just feel since this is a business, saying it's your 1st time may lead to them taking advantage of you. Not necessarily screwing you, but possibly up-selling you when the price should already include everything. Imagine being in sales and someone tells you they're new and want to buy something, many salesman will bullshit and up-sell. If rates are not listed, just nicely ask ""How much is a 1-hour appointment with you?"". NO mention of sex, you may use acronyms though like FS (Full-Service, the whole shebang). Do google the acronyms, I do believe someone has posted it before on this subreddit though. Yes, your apartment is fine. It's up to you if your neighbors may see, but that's your call. I never do outcalls, unless I am traveling for work and thus in a hotel. If I'm at home, I go to them (sometimes they are seedy motels). Stings, however, almost never occur for outcalls as cops won't send someone through all that trouble to bust 1 person. Incalls are more prone to stings, just be cautious and look around when you arrive at the hotel and really just trust your gut instinct. No, you do not need to schedule a meeting in a public place, in fact you will be billed for that as that counts as her time. Just meet for the appointment. If you're doing an outcall, most are minimum 1 hour, you can use the first 10 mins and offer a drink and chat at your place to get more at ease. You're screening should be your research when finding ads. Google the #, try to find reviews (if no reviews and/or no other ads by the provider, move on...)   This is what NOT to do at an incall: http://deadspin.com/cops-greg-anthony-offered-prostitute-80-for-sex-and-1682068791  Anything else, you can PM me. Glad to help."
Hookers,2tz6x6,hookerthrow22,2,Wed Jan 28 17:59:07 2015 UTC,"Learn the acronyms. Do not discuss ""rates"" or ""how much"" like the other posts said. Instead use the word ""donation"". Some Providers won't discuss services. Out call is safer regarding a sting but then you are letting a stranger in your house. They could be scoping it out. Trust your gut feeling. When you call listen for anything that makes you uneasy, like her speaking ghetto, pushy, etc. Be sure to Google her phone number to see if it is linked to other ads with different pictures and Google all of her photos. Make sure it is her. Call her and just say hi. Then ask if she is doing out calls to your city. If she says yes, ask how much an hour donation is. If you like DATY, DFK, etc. then ask her about services using the acronyms. They usually answer the questions if you ask that way. Then set up a time. Hide your wallet and only have the amount agreed upon visible for her. Keep an eye on her in your house at all times. Remember to trust your gut feeling about her when you call. Good luck.

So maybe she might actually enjoy your company but still at a price. If you still keep in mind ""business as usual"" you could at least maintain your head clear about all of this. I have had better experiences with providers I've seen multiple times, and even to do other things together, even to the point I could more with them. Hehe, well one time I just hung out with a provider after a session as we watched some silly reality show together while smoking up. She cuddled up with me like a girlfriend and we talked shit about the characters on the show."

Hookers,2ttm2u,roque72,5,Tue Jan 27 14:59:57 2015 UTC,"The first two I called just didn't answer.   Lots of girls are busy (with another client)   Third girl I called said I had to come to her, I said that's fine, where do I go. She gave me a neighborhood name and I said, okay, but what's the address. She gave me two street names that I know intersect but there is no hotel right there on the corner, I asked again for the address and she just said to come there. Sounded sketchy as fuck so I bailed.   Lots of girls are doing this to make sure till the end you aren't law enforcement, sometimes they need time to prep. Lots of girls I've experienced will take you step by step until you get to their room. This is normal. You would have had this one.   Fourth girl I called, no answer, but she called me back. I asked her if she was available tonight, she said sure, how long, I said half hour. She said that was $150 (her ad posted same day said hh was only $100, but I really wanted to fuck so I said that was fine). She asked me to text the address, I did, waited 2 hours, no show, no call.   Don't text your address ever. Always go to them, when your on their turf (kinda, a hotel usually where they often pair with a friend to make sure no psychos get them). She may have gotten another call right after you anyways with someone willing to go for an hour or longer and she just took the better business deal. I've never had someone back out when I got to the hotel, even if for half an hour. But for future reference, if they ask how long your going to stay just say maybe an hour. That way, when you get to the room you can just go down to half an hour if you want but you keep them thinking the whole time you may be giving them a bigger amount.    Also, is midnight too late to be calling hookers? Do I need to start earlier?   It's fine, but check the ads for posting time and description of ""up late"" b/c 12 is primetime, usually other guys want that time slot / are with a girl from 11 onward past 12.   Usually early worm gets the bird."

Hookers,2trabl,TTTT27,5,Tue Jan 27 21:13:04 2015 UTC,"Hookers, all the way.  As several posters have mentioned, the scenario that is posted only compares the time/money component, which in my opinion, is an incomplete comparison.   For some of us, money isn't really a variable anymore. We have lives that require a lot out of us, and to be quite frank, the time spent pulling women for ""free"" is more expensive than simply ""paying"" for it. I am very sensitive to costs, but to me, the cost is measured in time. Picking up a girl, taking her back, and then getting rid of her the next day is vastly more expensive than making an arrangement that becomes another line item on my calendar.  There are also additional social costs if I were to constantly pick up girls. Granted there is a social cost to hookers as well, but because of the ease of management, it's easier to keep that under wraps. No I'm not married.  Lastly, I simply enjoy paying for it. Couldn't tell you why."

You'll be able to keep it cool (at least in my experience), because if worst comes to worst you can still fuck a hooker at the end of the day.  Moreover, it'll give you experience on having sex, which at your age any partner would expect you to have.  However, in my experience it can become a sort of ""addiction"", yeah.

Realize the bias on each side.  Here is an examples.  Hookers will say that looks are very important while sexworkers will downplay that and say you can charge whatever you want even if you're a fatty.  On this issue hookers is telling the truth.  Here is another example.  Hookers will say that the girls often fall in love with clients and offer freebies, while sex workers says this rarely happens.  Here sexworkers is telling the truth.

All they do is schedule appointments for you and then collect cash from you for doing it. Just find a good website, not Backpage, and begin posting ads. Start out at 180. After you build a clientele increase to 200 or 220. Keep all of your regulars at the grandfathered rate of 180. After some time you build a reputation bump it up to 250 or if you are hot 300. Always keep the grandfathered rate for the original people that saw you. It is a reward for taking a chance on a newbie.  Be clear in your ads what you do and do not do.

Does your agency provide a driver, a car, muscle? I would be very surprised if they did. Anyone who takes your money for the work you do is a pimp.

In the U.S. you can't get insurance for being a prostitute. In your case an agency works because it is legal. An agency in the U.S. is just like a pimp.

That means you need to be able to tolerate a lot of alcohol....  you don't make a $1000/night getting singles tucked in your panties, you make it getting $100 off a champagne bottle."
Hookers,2tgym8,Derpaway4,3,Sat Jan 24 01:46:56 2015 UTC,"The advantage to a place like Mustang is, obviously, that it's safe and legal. But you pay a premium - a very high premium - for that. It'd be nice if the significant increase in cost brought you a significant increase in looks or service, but it doesn't.  I only did the legal brothel scene once, well over a decade ago. I think it was the Bunny Ranch, but it was definitely up there in the Reno area. It set me back about $200 for a very by-the-numbers BJ followed by equally by-the-numbers missionary with an overweight girl. The best word to describe the experience was ""clinical"".   For that same $200 I have had a couple of hours with an escort off the web. I've had 2 girls. I've had ""no rules"" experiences. I've had a phenomenal massage followed by equally phenomenal sex in an AMP. I've had a highly erotic lap dance followed by mind-blowing sex with a stripper. And in each and every case the woman was many, many times hotter than any I saw at the brothel.  And remember that was a long time ago - as /u/banal_animal said it's highly likely that the Mustang or the other brothels will barely talk to you for $200, but you can rest assured that the experience has not gone up with the price.  So my recommendations are to either find someone off Backpage or Eros or one of the other sites, or since your'e in the Reno/Sparks area, book a room at one of the casinos and hang out for a bit - the girls will find you. Or hell, for $400 you could book yourself a ticket to San Diego and have a knock-your-socks-off time in Tiajuana.  tl;dr: I pretty much agree with your conservative friends, although for radically different reasons."
Hookers,2tgym8,harfleur,2,Mon Jan 26 06:17:43 2015 UTC,Thank you for the response. From what little I could find online the ranch may be way out of my price range. Due to Nevada law they can't post prices online or talk about it on the phone (although that may be a ploy to get impulse business by having people visit to find prices.) The few people who did talk about price basically got more than one girl for more than an hour starting at $1000. I may be desperate but I'm not going to spend that much.  I do know the casinos have some escorts hanging around the bars but I did not think of it given I figured to go fully legal. Another option to consider I guess.
Hookers,2tgym8,banal_animal,2,Mon Jan 26 17:35:27 2015 UTC,"About 15 years ago, I went to the now-defunct Old Bridge Ranch.

Cops don't need to use some kind of James Bond technology or an in-depth investigation to arrest you for soliciting a prostitute.  All they need is to catch you offering to pay money for sex.  So ... don't make such an offer in words.  Instead, just do it.

After a late-night dinner at Denny's, I went over to a strip club (having nothing else to do).  The club inside was like any other - a lighted stage, loud music, small tables and drinks. Nothing really exciting. So I started to leave. Suddenly, a stripper grabs my arm. And she pulls me into a semi-private booth (instead of a door for privacy, there was a flimsy curtain).  She was young, slim, pretty and black. And she started doing a sexy dance for me. I was hooked. I soon gave her more money to continue dancing. She then put her hand down my pants. I could feel her hand holding my hard-on. It felt so good.  And she was practically naked. I was able to suck her sweet tits, a couple of times. I also fondled and kissed her fabulous ass. I had a great time. She put her hand down my pants again. It felt even better. She even simulated a blow job.  But she could not give me an actual blow job nor a hand job.

I went into a strip bar in order to get a view of some new boobs as I had just broken up with someone else, and this Asian chick starts coming on STRONG. I have never been the guy that wants a dance and I told her that, but she led me over to a chair whipped out my dick and proceeded to give me a HJ with a nice little dance (after we agreed to a price of course). Only 40 bucks. Pretty impressive if i do say so myself. I still wonder what was up with that. I never really went back to that side of town (I had only been there in order to not be seen by anyone else)."
Hookers,2t2bdp,minorwhite,3,Wed Jan 21 03:56:00 2015 UTC,"As others have said, it's very location-dependent.   My first paid girl was a stripper at a club in SF. Middle of the day mid-week and I was the only one in the club. Lots of extra touching during her stage dance, then she approached me for a private dance. The club at the time had a porn movie theater attached to it, so we went in there. She took me to the front row, got naked (many of the clubs in SF are full nude), danced for a bit, then undid my pants and mounted me.   Lots of similar experiences in that and other SF clubs back in the day as well. I haven't been to any there in many years since I moved away, so I don't know if things have changed.  I've also been to clubs in Kansas City, Sacramento, Denver, LA, New Orleans and Orlando. Never had any luck in any non-nude club. The girl in New Orleans was fine letting me do whatever I wanted to her with my hands (and fingers) but wouldn't reciprocate.  Miami, though, is the place to be if you want full service clubs. I've never struck out there. One time, I literally just walked into a club and was still getting my bearings when a girl walked up and simply said ""Wanna fuck?""   No question strip club sex is much more hit-and-miss, and much pricier, but it is as you said safer and you at least get to see the girl before you need to commit to anything.  I miss Miami..."

I've had one offer FS in the back room but it was pricey and I didn't take her up on the offer.  Had 2 others give me their number and told me they wanted to meet up (for sex) afterwords, but it never materialized...  It's hard to follow up the same night when she gets off work at 4:00AM.      It's a pricey way of getting your rocks off, though.

The rule of thumb is bring $$$$, and YMMV.  Where the club is very much determines how much fun you might have.  In Houston, 90% of the girls will play, in Dallas it might be 80%.  In Austin it was a little lower, and San Antonio was lower still.  But, with patience and knowing how to ask the right people, fun can be had.  There were very few times I left a club without  having as much fun as I wanted.  If the club frowns on too much fun, leaving is always an option.  A word of caution, strip clubs and playing the game is way more expensive than just finding an escort, but it is a lot of fun."

If you just want to get laid with somebody decently to fairly hot you literally just have to walk up to an apartment and ring a doorbell.  HK scene is mostly hotel girls and apartment walk-ups. Depending on where you are, they might cater more to locals (Mong Kok, Tsim Sha Tsui, etc...) or to expats (Central and Admiralty). This is also reflected in the price. HK prices go pretty low (like <300HKD) but expect to pay ~500 - ~1000 HKD for somebody hot for 30m - 1hr. Possibly more if you are an obvious foreigner AND newbie.  HK has a bunch of review boards but all the English speakers hang out on the sex141 forum.  If you want a very different yet probably awesome experience, you can just ferry over to Macau for a day trip. The big thing there is saunas and casinos. It's Vegas on crack.

I'll try and answer your questions though.   From my experience, you don't want to go right as they open. If they advertise that they are open from 10am-10pm, I would come in around 1 or 2. The reason for this is some girls only arrive at 10 and then take some time to get ready, they also will eat lunch around 12. If you come in at this time you'll have to wait longer than normal. The earlier you come in the fresher the girl will be. Sometimes I've gone in at around 8 or 9 at night and the girl was very tired and would get very sensitive in her pussy because she had been seeing clients all day. If you go, you don't want to act like it's your first time. It will make the girl nervous. You want to act like you've done this before. I can't speak for where you live but in Southern California it's generally $40 HJ, $80 BJ, $100 FS. Look to the guide I linked on how to bring up extra services. The $60 for an hour you saw is the house fee you pay to the mamasan at the front. You'll pay this in addition to the tip. Don't ever explicitly ask for sex acts. You can pay beforehand if you are confident you are going to get what you pay for. If you do this, just leave the tip on a table. I have always tipped afterward because you never know what will happen. Don't ever explicitly ask for sexual services from anyone. This will get you kicked out. During the massage give some signs that you are interested in extras (rub her thighs, have the towel barely cover your ass). She should then ask you what you want. From there you can make signs for a HJ, BJ or say ""everything"" or ""full service"" for FS. Most places will not let you see the girl before hand. You can ask the mamasan for an asian girl or latina girl if the place offers both. You can't really make sure you get a pretty girl. Best thing to do would be to go to a site like rubmaps.com and look up reviews of girls. Tips will be added onto the house fee you pay. So $60 for an hour plus $40 tip for a HJ."

Hookers,2spph9,throowaway2,5,Sat Jan 17 06:38:39 2015 UTC,"Well, it looks like you're in a tough spot. I'd try to look at your anxiety issues; maybe this inability to perform is psychological. Why do you feel anxious? Are you relaxed during the session? Maybe you could try to see the same hooker a few times so you can grow to know her better and be more comfortable with her.  One trick to help it a little is doing lots and lots of foreplay."

Hookers,2spph9,bredontopology,2,Sat Jan 17 20:58:57 2015 UTC,Why do you think you get anxious? Why do you fuck hookers? Have you ever had sex with a non-hooker? How often do you look at porn? I guess maybe you could try a therapist
Hookers,2spph9,creepstalker69,5,Sat Jan 17 23:46:44 2015 UTC,"I have the same problem.  It is all psychological.  The act of having sex makes us vulnerable.  In the olden days, when we had predators, sex needed to be wrapped up quick, or your body told you to not begin sex at all.  Thus, when we are not relaxed, some of us can't get it up or finish too early.  Just by reading your words, and I don't mean to be insulting, you sound like an anxious guy.  Maybe you don't have too many opportunities to have sex, so you overload while with a provider, and your body thinks this is all it can get, so go for it.  At least I'm that way.  I noticed I marginally lasted longer after a repeat visit with a provider, so its likely I was more trusting with her.  The first time I was anxious, as well as not having O'd for two weeks.  The second and third times, I was the one watching the clock: I was anxious not to go over the time limit, as I tried to cram in too many activities.  The first rule is to not worry about cumming to quick, it will only make it worse.  Instead, try to approach your anxiety issues.  Also, try to let the appointment flow naturally, instead of having a preset list of activities you want to try."
Hookers,2spph9,creepstalker69,1 point,Sat Jan 17 18:01:08 2015 UTC,How are you able to get over being anxious and very tense? I just wish I would be able to last long so that way I would be able to enjoy the sensations(provider too).  How do I approach them and fix? I have no idea where to start.
Hookers,2spph9,hkthrow1,1 point,Sat Jan 17 20:53:53 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't try to fix the issue, I prefer hour long GFE, so I pop at beginning and end of session.  As for reducing anxiety: NoFap, abstain from porn, pick a preferred provider and don't look  at reviews for others.    You should not care about the providers enjoyment.  For most, its just a job, and many do not cum with clients.  You need to realize that in most cases, its a buyers market.  Is sex unobtainable otherwise?  With regular visits, you will relax in time.  Most important: do not worry about lasting long, if you keep worrying, you will be anxious, which makes you pop earlier.  Its a cycle that feeds itself.  Despite what you think, foreplay doesn't make pops earlier, it relaxes you too."
Hookers,2spph9,Hamster_S_Thompson,2,Sat Jan 17 21:13:33 2015 UTC,"Hey there. I can relate a bit-- I'm 25, suffer from pretty bad anxiety (relating to both sex and everyday life), and don't last very long either. Some tips:   Masturbating an hour before may not be close enough to the act. Is there any way you can do it 10 or 15 minutes before? Have you tried ""extended pleasure"" type condoms? They have a small amount of a numbing agent in them to help you last longer. Alternatively, look for a product called ""Mandelay"", it's available at CVS and probably other major pharmacies. It's a similar type of numbing agent in a tube-- you apply it like you would a lotion, a few minutes before the act. I know you mentioned not wanting to drink alcohol, but it helps. Realistically, depending on your size and metabolism, two, maybe three drinks aren't going to impair your driving significantly-- or at least, you'll fall under the legal limit for DUI. In addition to a mild ""whiskey dick"" effect, it'll get you a little looser and more comfortable, which might help you last longer. Sounds like you're not too comfortable with mind-altering substances, but cocaine also helps. Look for a provider that offers MSOG. This way you don't need to worry about busting too quickly. Or, you could have her jerk or suck you to completion once before you get down to business. Depends how comfortable you are with a particular provider, but even if they don't list it explicitly on their menu anywhere, I'm sure many would be open to it if you asked, for an extra fee. If you feel yourself getting close, pull out and change positions. Even if it's as simple as her flipping from her back to her stomach, those 15-30 seconds will let you cool down a bit. You could also play with her tits, finger her, whatever you like that doesn't involve your dick getting touched. As a last resort (this is half in jest), find a clean, but less attractive provider. Once, I met a black provider who was about 40 lbs heavier than her pictures online. However, she had a decent face and nice big tits, and was a great deal ($100 MSOG). I was really horny so I decided to go for it anyway. I actually had a GREAT time. I wasn't really into her so I lasted a long time, but her pussy and mouth felt about as great as any other providers I've seen. I was totally drained and satisfied afterward, in a way that I wasn't after seeing some hotter providers who made me bust in a couple minutes.   Good luck OP. Don't worry about it too much. It doesn't matter if you bust quickly as long as you're enjoying yourself. You win some, you lose some.  EDIT: Almost forgot one thing. When you're getting close, some people have success delaying ejaculation by giving a firm squeeze to the base of the penis, the base of the head, or the area right under your balls (your taint, essentially)-- not sure which is correct, I've heard it all three ways. I've had varying degrees of success with all three, not sure what the ""proper"" technique is. But you might want to give it a shot while masturbating and see if it helps you."

Hookers,2sllu7,hoookerthrowaway,13,Fri Jan 16 05:11:19 2015 UTC,"I want you all to keep in mind that MOST of the girls posting on backpages are not PROFESSIONALs.  Sounds like you came across a bad provider and sadly it has happened to everyone.    I strongly suggest you research each provider you find an interest in.  Look up their phone numbers for reviews.  I have written reviews in TER warning others of bad experiences myself.      When you decide to try again.. stay off backpages.  Log into TER, look up providers in your area and use the search filters.  Search for providers with excellent reviews ( meaning they deliver on advertised services) and PAY the extra money.   Excellent service is worth the price for those just getting into the experience.    Yes there are decent providers on backpages, but I wouldn't recommended it for those just getting into the game.  Once you have your feet wet.. and know what you like.  Then dabble in backpages.  Yes there are many gems to be found, but by far most of the providers there are 1) not the girl in the photo and 2) don't provide great service."

HPV can be spread from females to males via cunilingus.  Although the vaccine is recommended to be administered before one's first sexual contact or age 26, you can in fact receive it later in life and it may be beneficial if your cunilingus partners have been limited.   It is also worth pointing out that the risk of throat cancer from smoking is far higher than throat cancer from cunilingus.  Quit smoking.

Hookers,2s4v8s,hobaloo,3,Mon Jan 12 13:01:33 2015 UTC,"A couple notes for anyone interested in seeing a pornstar, although cp9406 covered most of it.  first, just because a girl is listed on a site does not mean that she will be available when you want to see her.  They have other things going on with their lives and some of them, maybe a good number, aren't exactly reliable. Also there have been rumblings that some (maybe even all) pornstar agencies put pictures and descriptions of pornstars that they don't even represent and/or is not even in the escort ""game"".  Kind of like bait to get us pathetic losers to contact the agency hoping to get a date with a particular girl.  Then only to be told ""oh sorry, she's not available, but xxx is available and lots of guys like her, would you be interested in meeting her?""    Also, do your research.  There are a few escort review sites that have reviews of pornstar escorts.  theeroticreview.com probably has the most pornstar escort reviews.  All of the pornstars mentioned on this thread so far except Remy Lacroix and Mia Malkova have reviews.  As far as I know Remy Lacroix and Mia Malkova aren't escorting...yet.  Maybe they are UTR, but I'd think both are out of my price range right now.  I'm a TLC fan, just like cp9406, but if you do contact Adonia at TLC, please keep in mind it is a one woman show.  What I mean is that she is the only one that is communicating with the client, scheduling for the girls, doing the screening and whatever else needs to be done.  There are plenty of stories of guys complaining because Adonia never follows up with them.  I think it best if you are a first time client to contact her with a specific or as specific as possible date and time, which girl and your screening information.  The TLC website has a form you can fill out with all this information.  MPP also has a similar form as well.  As for screening, it usually consists of providing the names and contact information of a few escorts that you've seen in the past who can vouch for you.  If you are a member of a service like RSK2000, P411 or date check, the agency might also take that information.   Some will even accept TER Whitelists as screening and verification.  If you've never seen an escort before or you're an AMP goer, and can't provide references, then some agencies will ask you to provide personal information like your work contact information.  Another agency in LA that I've heard good this about is Hetaera agency.  http://www.hetaera-agency.com/  tl;dr plan ahead, do your research and expect to get screened."

Hookers,2rvuib,rman111z,4,Fri Jan 9 19:03:36 2015 UTC,"I think it will take clients and providers to come ""out"" more.  Right now clients are stereotyped as hopeless johns cheating on their wives and providers are categorized as helpless trafficking victims.   Imagine if instead positive images - say of a disabled man, who had not had sex in years, gaining confidence and fulfillment from a sex worker.  Or a young woman who couldn't afford college, yet who through sex work manages to save up money, buy her parents a house, gain confidence and start her own business.   For the last decade and a half, the religious right and feminist left have allied to latch onto the ""trafficking"" issue.  And they've had quite a bit of success presenting THEIR version of sex work, even convincing countries where sex work was previously unregulated to adapt a ""Nordic model"".   We need more sex workers, and more clients to come out as normal, well adjusted, happy people.  We need to publicize how decriminalized prostitution in australia and new zealand have virtually eliminated trafficking and other problems.  And we need to consistently keep the goal to be the DECRIMINALIZATION of sex work.  Simple message, that what two consenting adults do in bed together - even if it includes an exchange of money - is their business alone and not the government's. That way, we don't shoot the movement in the foot by debating where to locate red light districts (answer will always be not in my backyard) or how to regulate a brothel (Nevada's model is hardly the best).  And we need to spread the message in academic conferences, forums, community and religious groups.  Hats off to those who are already doing these things."
Hookers,2rvuib,TTTT27,1 point,Sat Jan 10 05:14:33 2015 UTC,What would you change about Nevada's brothels?
Hookers,2rvuib,SarahGreenmore,2,Sat Jan 10 15:19:52 2015 UTC,"Probably nothing as the system seems to work there and the system has survived attempts to change it.  However, i support decriminalization along the Australia/New Zealand model.  Start with the ironclad presumption that sex acts between consenting adults are a private matter between two individuals.  Not the givernment's business.  Period.  If the two individuals want to exchange money, their business.  Then, local areas could regulate sex work like any other commercial activity.  For example, if its illegal to sell knickknacks on the streetcorner, it could also be illegal to sell sex there.  Most sexwork is arranged over the internet and takes place indoors, anyway.  What are usually seen as the negative aspects of sex work (pimping, street hustling) can in fact be better controlled, or altogether eliminated, in a decriminalized environment."
Hookers,2rvuib,TTTT27,1 point,Sat Jan 10 17:55:44 2015 UTC,"I agree with your statements. I think that there is a focus on the negative (which has its own place) and a disconnect about WHO a client is. Not sexual deviants praying on females, but real, fairly normal people who have a need or desire. I work in Nevada and we have a lot of mentally and physicality disabled/impared clients. They should be denied something as basic, and in my opinion, vital to mental and physical well being, human intimacy because a monetary exchange takes place? I don't understand. I agree that consenting adults should feel free to do what they wish behind closed doors."
Hookers,2rvuib,SarahGreenmore,1 point,Sat Jan 10 18:12:09 2015 UTC,"I'm curious - Have you worked in other settings outside of Nevada?  How does working inthe legal brothels compare with independent work in terms of income?  Are there other benefits to working in a brothel, such as safety and being part of a community?"
Hookers,2rvuib,TTTT27,1 point,Sat Jan 10 23:01:38 2015 UTC,"I have worked in the adult industry for many, many years. Porn, webcam modeling, sugaring, escorting. Currently I work at the Moonlite Bunny Ranch in Carson City, NV.  I had a ""normal career"" that would occupy 45-60 hours a week of my time so seeing clients was on a hobby and almost fetish basis (I was a huge slut until I realized the value I could place on my self and the services.) The dream was that I could do my career part time and sex work part time... but I was still unable to balance social/career/health/sex work. I decided that if I quit my normal career that I could focus more on myself, my health/fitness, my sex work which was incredibly more gratifying than my other career.   So in terms of -  Money - It's much, much higher than what I could have made in Portland, where I'm from. There is overhead, travel, licencing, doctors weekly, rent, all your supplies, etc, however, the amount I'm charging per hour is higher than what can be supported in Portland with the same volume of traffic.   Safety - Call buttons in our room when pressed, will trigger an automatic 911 call. We're on very good terms with LE. We have multiple male staff members. We have multiple video cameras and if you're paying with a card, we have your photo ID scanned. People do not come here to make trouble, and the only time I had an issue with a client I was able to take care of it myself without involving outside help. I was lucky to not have anything dangerous happen to me while I was working illegally despite putting myself in some really stupid situations when I was younger.  Community - This is the big one. You're living in a house with so many ladies. Everyone comes from different backgrounds. Its like a giant sorority and everyone's in their underwear all the time. Its a huge support network. We laugh all day long. Its a fucking blast. I may go a few days without making money (technically then owing money to the house for rent) but the community and support, the experience of the legal brothel, makes it all worth it."
Hookers,2rvuib,SarahGreenmore,1 point,Sun Jan 11 09:03:43 2015 UTC,Sorry - meant higher rate with a high volume of clients.  The rate I'm charging would not see the same volume in Portland.
Hookers,2rvuib,SarahGreenmore,2,Sun Jan 11 15:29:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not opptimistic about it. I think we have too much of a 'puritan' view on sex work still. The idea that sex in a transactional sense is somehow much different than sex for sex, and moreso, inherently bad.   I think we'll see full drug legalization before we even see the discussion of legalized prostitution. Mainly because no one is barking up any big tree. We don't see a huge outcry for it, probably because it's a big risk to come out as either a john or a prostitute. I wish I could tell everyone about the women I see. I love it. I'm proud to be someone who can fulfill the need of another human being and yet receive the sexual intimacy and connection I desire. It's truly a win win."

Marijana seems to be taking longer to spread to the other states, most likely due to the lobbying from the tobacco and alcohol industries.  Prostitution might be a little tougher, because of the Red Light Districts issues that might come up. If the law would allow freelancing, or if it needs to be at an actual brick and mortar facility with zoning laws."

I've stopped seeing clients for being terrible kissers, for them being too rough/handsy, for crying, for wanting friendship outside of appointments, etc.   It was probably something to do with you touching her asshole and fingering her.

I would never ever try to get pregnant or if I did keep the child from a client.   It's not my main job, more of a hobby, so I could have a baby just fine and still have n income, but I would never. Ever. For most providers they depend on their bodies for money. No one would try to get pregnant and give up their income."

Not gonna lie you might not even be able to make an appointment.  Most of the highly reviewed girls are pretty good bets. If you're worried about bait/switch try to verify the number in the ad with the number in the review, the good schedulers usually keep their numbers for a while.

She has since become very popular and tightened her screening procedure.  If you need that first reference you can probably just try to schedule with some of the less popular women (they're usually a little older) If business is slow they may take on a new customer. It might be hit/miss so try a couple.  Once you have a reference you may have to try a couple times to schedule with some of the popular k-girls. They usually book up fast and prefer their regulars.  Also when dealing with schedulers. Manners go a long way, they prefer mild mannered gentleman so do your best impression."
Hookers,2rpat9,whynotraobj,1 point,Wed Jan 14 09:25:13 2015 UTC,"/u/masre is totally correct. I just started this hobby and saw my first k-girl just a few days ago. The best thing to do is read up on all the discussion boards like TER and there is some good advice on there but frankly there is no short cut. I think the best advice I ever got was that you just have to be patient. and like /u/masre said, you need to target the newest ones with the least reviews. You're going to have to call a lot of numbers and you'll get very few responses if any. I was lucky to get one response out of over 10 different numbers and the booker was very nice. It is important to be polite and show manners, that is definitely true. But I will tell you that all that work is totally worth it. These girls are not only really hot but they put in great effort and really are trained quite well. For the kind of service I got the other day I thought I was going to have to pay like 600 or 700, some crazy amount. I really like TER and if you use the search function correctly you'll have no trouble finding new girls on the scene who might be willing to let you in because they need to build a clientele."

Sex surrogates are much more likely to understand your disability and how to work with it without making you feel rushed or uncomfortable.

The other advantage of going with a surrogate is that they are basically legal and very safe.    No one has been busted for using one.

What is not ok is discussing the exchange of money for sexual services. As for my experience level, I've been doing this for three years in two different cities. The punitive sex trade laws in NYC are not geared towards locking up men with zipper problems or 20 something girls trying to pay their rent/tuition, which is why I'm not as paranoid as everyone around me about this type of thing.

HPV (which can causes cervical cancer), Herpes, and HIV are not and are all very easily contracted contrary to your belief.  Quite frankly, knowing that people are this flippant about keeping themselves healthy is scary. Really really scary...Like honestly, do you think STI's are some conspiracy created by health insurance companies to make more money or something? The percentages are low for certain STIs like HIV which does not mean that they are harder to contract. It simply means that you might have sex with 100 women bareback with no incident, and then you find just one smoking hot girl/guy who takes you home after a night of drinking, fucks you raw dog and then sends you home with disease.   If you fuck everyone you meet without protection, it's like going to vegas: maybe you'll get lucky and stay clean or maybe you'll crap out and end up having to take pills every day of your life to keep warts from growing on your dick. Not to mention having to explain to all of your sexual partners that they might experience some new growth in their pubic area.   It sounds like you've gotten lucky, but I don't bet all my chips in one hand especially because my job is already risky enough."

I've never really understood a lot of the women I've had relationships with. And it's not like I've chosen some degenerate, lost soul type of women to date either. Hell my college girlfriend was one of the sweetest, honest, open, and caring human being I met. She was an FFA officer, studied to be a vet, and had a heart of gold. That lasted for 2 years. All within a week it changed. It was incredible, it was like a light switch turned on in her head and she realized how far her looks could take her, the power she held over men with those looks, and how much easier life could be by using those looks to skate by. It was just so weird seeing her go from this warm and friendly person to someone who could care less about anyone who couldn't give her things.   I'm ranting now, but I still side with you. I know what you are getting at I know what you mean. Just remember to keep yourself in check, just like I'm trying to do now, and make sure you aren't missing real opportunities to connect with people. Not saying a connection can't be established with a provider, but that is the illusion you are buying in to. To me though, that illusion is ten times better than the real deal. At least for the time being."
Hookers,2qwtks,pottah85,1 point,Sat Jan 3 00:24:45 2015 UTC,"Wow, I really think you understand :) i'm glad.  I had a similar experience to you. I was totally in love with a girl. She was really an angel. She would look after me when I was sick, she would make these beautiful homemade crafts for me and just generally make me feel really happy. I wanted to marry her when I finished university and live with her forever. But out of nowhere, her behaviour began to change and I have no reason why, or how to stop it. Eventually she told me that she wanted to break up with no reason but she 'wasn't feeling right about it'. That was 2 years ago, and although i'm over the worst of it, I realised that only a fool would fall in love and give so much trust to a woman.  Please check my question's text box. I will update it now to better explain my opinion. You're right though. A convincing illusion is much better than 'real life'. But at the end of the day, what is 'real life'? Isn't that an illusion in itself?"

Hookers,2qwtks,midnightyeti,1 point,Sat Jan 3 03:08:53 2015 UTC,"I get what you are saying OP, but I would be careful going down this path. I sort of picked the provider lifestyle just because I really value my emotional health at the moment and have had the past 3 relationships basically tear me up physically and mentally.  When you are with someone you love and trust, it's incredible. It's better than sex, drugs, or money. But when it comes crashing down.... Fuuuuuuuck. It's fucked up.   I know what I am doing is temporary because sooner or later I'm going to want someone I can come home to. But for now, I love the single life. I love not being tied down. I love saying ""Fuck it, I'm going on a hike for a few hours"" or ""I'm going to blaze all day and be a couch potato"". I can literally do anything I want without having to worry about someone taking it the wrong way, getting mad at me, or vice versa. It's wonderful. Plus I've said this before, but the women I see are some of the most incredible PEOPLE I've ever met. I love listening to them and hearing their views on life. Providers, to me, are some of the most real and down to earth people."

If you have the money, and don't want the emotional attachment or commitment, hookers are great. You pick the person, time and place, and call all the shots, and blow money shots.  If you want to go to the movies and go out for dinners, not sure if your money would be well spent doing that with a hooker and in that case, would recommend a good friend, or a girlfriend."

I am not sure where you are coming from, but do you view a girlfriend or wife as solely for the purpose of having sex? This may be what you need to examine. If you have enough money, and if all you want is an hour of sex occasionally, then yes, hookers can serve that purpose. But girlfriends provide a whole lot more than that. BTW, hookers are normal girls who pretend...most of the time...to love having sex with you. Many have drug habits that need to be financed. And let's not forget that paying for sex is illegal.  You need to learn how to naturally seduce and score with REAL girls (not just rent hookers for an hour a time). Sex with a hooker may seem sweet at that moment, but when you know you had to pay for it, you feel like shit afterwards and it kills your self esteem. Escorts cannot replace a girlfriend or wife.

Also, if the provider is real, she will have either more ads for the area she is working, or if she is a traveling provider, you will find ads from other area, but the number and photos will be the same.  Mostly, just use some common sense.  I also use http://www.usasexguide.info.  Find the boards for your area (or one that is close to you) and check out the reviews there."

Hookers,2qfgyu,RentAThrowAway1,5,Fri Dec 26 07:11:53 2014 UTC,"Please tell her that you are a virgin.  I see posts on this sub all the time advising virgins to keep their secret, this is shitty advice.  Your provider should know you are inexperienced in order to tailor your session, ensuring you get the most out of it.   Please tell her.   Im sitting in a room with 12 other escorts, and all of them agree that withholding this info leads to a bad time.   Or at least, a less enjoyable session."
Hookers,2qfgyu,CallAnna,3,Sat Dec 27 06:19:29 2014 UTC,"Sure you want to do this? At 18 lots of girls and guys are still virgins.  Be bold, find a cute girl at your orientation and ask her out. If you are a virgin, definitely bring it up.  Doesn't really require a big explanation, more like, ""This is my first time.  I'm a virgin."" That's all it takes, she should take the lead from there.  Don't do a QV, a full hour is better so you both have time to relax and explore.  Countries where sex work is legal even have entire agencies dedicated to providing a first-class experience to virgins. Scams unfortunately are a fact of life in the U.S. where sex work is illegal.  That's why reviews are so important.  If you have the time to plan this out, you could go to Canada, where it is more or less legal.   Backpage is generally the low-end of the industry and has more than its share of scams or women selling sex in desperation.  There are higher end providers who enjoy doing this and are very good at their craft -- read the posts here and on r/sexworkers for where they are found. Classiest way to handle payment is in an envelope you conspicuously give her or leave in an obvious place.  She will expect it upon meeting or shortly thereafter. Think with the head on your shoulders.  If something seems too sketchy, or wrong, just leave before going through.  Might want to do this during the daytime."
Hookers,2qfgyu,TTTT27,1 point,Sat Dec 27 04:57:37 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't tell her your virigin upfront, but as the session is starting to heat up I would then casually mention it. You just don't want her to change prices or upsell you since you're a newbie. Just make sure you can find reviews and if not, her phone # has multiple outlets with the same picture on google. QV is a blow and go, HHR is everything but in 30 minutes, and HR, normally is everything in 1 hour but you have more time to do anything and most of the times girls allow multiples. Payment will be mentioned as a ""donation"" or ""roses"" on the phone by the provider, unless it's mentioned in the ad."

Not many escorts are open to trusting a stranger like that.   I have worked in the industry for 6 years and have only met 3 escorts who offer anal, let alone PSE style anal ""poundings"".   Frankly, that sounds like a risky nightmare that would make you way too sore to work for three days"
Hookers,2q9mcd,CallAnna,1 point,Wed Dec 24 22:29:24 2014 UTC,"Thank you, I am definitely aware it's not common because of the reasons you mention. Just wondering how rare it is, and if there's a way to find it. As /u/paulkersey1999 says, porn producers can find hot girls who take 10x6 inch porn cocks hard and deep with smiles on their faces, so it seems like there ought to be some percentage of escorts who could take a similar pounding from my more average 7.5x5 inches. But those porn scenes require a lot of prep (as /u/LOVE_YOU_SHORT_TIME mentions), and I'm sure there's a lot of unsexy stuff that gets left on the cutting room floor, so I'm just not sure what kind of experience I can realistically expect to find.   I have wondered if paying the $1000+/hour rate for an actual pornstar gets you the same performance you see in their movies (minus the bareback, of course). I'm a little skeptical of their reviews because I feel like some of the guys are just so blown away by WHO they fucked that they neglect HOW they fucked."
Hookers,2q9mcd,CallAnna,6,Thu Dec 25 09:38:56 2014 UTC,"Also be aware that those ""anally talented"" pornstars are shooting scenes with partners who they are familiar with and trust as coworkers.  Not a complete stranger.   They also have an entire production team there that ensures they stay safe and don't get hurt or abused.   An escort is all alone with a stranger, blindly trusting him to penetrate her body in an area not meant to be penetrated."
Hookers,2q9mcd,paulkersey1999,1 point,Thu Dec 25 21:09:18 2014 UTC,"hi. 1-of course they exist. the porn producers find them. you might have to pay extra for what you want, but everything ""exists"". 2-search for fetish providers, or place your own ad stating what you want. 3-san fran definitely has what you want, though i am in florida and have no specific info for you. there must be some forums/clubs devoted to this in your area or ask around at normal escort services and maybe they can refer you."
Hookers,2q9mcd,LOVE_YOU_SHORT_TIME,1 point,Wed Dec 24 20:39:58 2014 UTC,"The only true PSE that I have had has been with actual porn stars. Or should I say porn 'stars'. Girls who have done a few films, and are trading on that, and charge accordingly. By charging a lot of money, and only taking a handful of clients, they can take time to prepare for your 'scene'. They tend to run the pace of the session, and make it seem like aggressive sex on their part.  I did just this just recently with a touring girl from Italy, but I have also had amazing sessions in NZ, and Prague. I don't normally seek out Greek at all, but very occasionally go for PSE if somebody hot is passing through town, and if I feel like celebrating. Watching porn by women you have actually fucked is awesome.  And they prepare like actual porn stars. The escort I saw in NZ talked about her prep, and which involved an enema and inflatable butt plug before I arrived."
Hookers,2q9mcd,ProstiFriend,1 point,Wed Dec 24 22:27:54 2014 UTC,"If you were in Toronto I could point you to a very unique girl. Her speciality is taking an anal pounding then ATM. She loves it rough too.   She's out there, so I'm sure there is someone like that in SF too, the problem is finding her.   Also I'm terms of the name calling you'd want to clear that with a girl over email or text before meeting. You never know what she's experienced in her life and you'd hate to go too far and end the session with her in tears and you not finishing. Every girl is unique so if you are into it ask her.   Your ideal girl is out there, but is going to be hard to find."
Hookers,2q937e,supermml,5,Wed Dec 24 05:30:46 2014 UTC,"Unfortunately you can't.  You can do several things to minimize your chances of getting caught in one.  1) Only see heavily reviewed providers.  Reviews from a commonly known site ( The Erotic Review).  Her add saying she is heavily reviewed means nothing. See it for your self or consider it bogus.  2) Don't go see someone ""new"" on the scene with ASTOUNDINGLY beautiful pictures.   Cross check the photos against TINEYE.COM and Google images.  IF the photo comes up on other sites, in other cities for the same day... it's a fake pic.  A few girls travel, but not everyone.  If she uses a pic from a porn site.. pass.   Stay away from ""lunch"" and around rush hour dates (when most of us are going to or coming from work).  Go early morning or late in the evening.  Every city is different so it really depends on where you live.  Lastly.. if she appears too good to be true ( Super model image advertising for rock bottom prices) stay away, FAR AWAY."
Hookers,2q937e,malibijones,5,Wed Dec 24 19:12:56 2014 UTC,"that won't help, i'm afraid. in most places you are guilty the minute you show up at the location. follow malibijones' advice in this thread. the good news is these stings are quite rare. depending on your location most cities do them only once or twice a year if at all. the odds are in your favor, but there is no guarantees."
Hookers,2q937e,paulkersey1999,3,Wed Dec 24 19:07:29 2014 UTC,"No, you are not guilty the minute you show up.  To be found guilty of soliciting a prostitute, you must SPECIFICALLY agree to exchange money for sex and intend to go through with the transaction.   Now -- this doesn't mean that you couldn't be arrested just for showing up. Cops can arrest people.  Cops may try to get you to incriminate yourself after arrest.  HOWEVER...unless you have said something incriminating...such a case will likely be tossed out before even coming to trial.  The whole point of the ""john-busts"" is to embarrass and shame the victims.  And at the same time to let the cops pretend they are actually doing work.  And perhaps to fund a phony 'rescue' organization that runs a ""johns school"" diversion program.  A lot of the time, guys who are caught in this are so humiliated by the experience they just plead out and accept whatever punishment they receive.  Don't be that guy.   The best defense against an arrest is not to agree at any time (in writing, or in words) to paying money for sex.  This goes for both providers and clients.  Believe it or not, it is still not a crime to have sex with someone.  Nor is it illegal to have money.  Figure out a way to combine these two, without specifically stating such, and you are fine.  In the USA, this business thrives on innuendo."
Hookers,2q937e,TTTT27,2,Wed Dec 24 20:47:43 2014 UTC,"you are right, you are not ""guilty"" until you are tried and convicted, but if you show up, even if you don't go inside the room they will arrest you because you called and arranged for the sex for money exchange, so the original answer of ""make the hooker show her tits or touch you"" will not help avoid arrest.   i agree the whole idea of these stings is total bullshit and the cops totally get off on hassling johns in this way. furthermore, the idea that prostitution is illegal in the first place is ridiculous."
Hookers,2q937e,paulkersey1999,1 point,Fri Dec 26 06:12:58 2014 UTC,"True, if cops want to arrest someone, they will, even if  purely out of frustration.  However, the trick is to not agree to a sex for money exchange - not in email, not in person, and not over the phone.  Experienced providers know this and will end any phone or email inquiry that turns to sex for money.  All you can do is agree to an hour (or whatever) of her time for a specific amount of money.  NO talk of what that time will entail.  One cannot be convicted if there was never an agreement to exchange sex for money.  Obviously this can lead to misunderstandings or even outright scams that don't happen in places where things can be talked about openly.  But the amazing thing is how often things go very smoothly and both parties get exactly what they want."

I could tell they were well above my budget when the women casually talked about what some men paid ( well over 5k) for some meetings.

Hookers,2q56rl,GoingAbroad100,3,Tue Dec 23 04:40:55 2014 UTC,"In Sydney, I normally visit Tiffany's, in Surrey Hills. It is very reliable, and the girls are hot. I normally head in late morning/early afternoon when it is quiet, and there are often young students working. There are many many establishments, but that one is a good place to start, as it is classy and very well run.  One thing to note though is that there is a quirk of brothels in Australia, in that you will probably have to pass an 'inspection' in the room. All have an introduction system where the girls will come in one by one and introduce themselves. Then the manager will ask you to pick, and that girl will take you up to your room. At that point you will have to drop your pants and have your gear inspected using a lamp, before the session goes any further. This is good practice from a public health perspective, but it is a somewhat confrontational way to meet a stranger. But after formalities, Australian girls are a huge amount of fun."
Hookers,2q56rl,LOVE_YOU_SHORT_TIME,2,Wed Dec 24 22:14:57 2014 UTC,"Am I better off going with 30, 45 or hour long sessions?   Make this decision based on how long you usually take to get off, but remember this time will most likely include the afterwards showering time.   What time am I typically best to go at?   Brothels are generally open till late, though the girls charge more at night.   Are there review boards about what brothels are typically the best to see?   Not sure. But if you're coming to Sydney, make sure you head out to Kings Cross - it's right in the city and there are clubs that cater to all tastes.   Does Australia have some sort of rules that the girls can't show themselves on the brothel websites?   I think they choose to not show their faces on purpose. But I have seen girls display their faces on some websites though. But like I said, the clubs in Kings Cross have some of the best looking women I have ever seen."

In Melbourne and Sydney there are a lot of Asian only brothels. In Melbourne most of the main brothels in South Melbourne are predominantly Anglo with a mix of ethnicities.   Pick a girl based on personality as well as looks. Try to avoid peak times like Friday night - you may have to wait for a room. Standard service is massage, protected oral and sex. You pay extra if you want kissing and other services. Don't haggle price and don't push boundaries (not saying you will, just saying).   You'll be given a quick health check and asked to shower before things start.   You can always ring ahead and ask for descriptions of the girls who are working. You can also book in advance.   I'm a brothel worker located in Melbourne who also works in Sydney. Feel free to contact me if you have have questions."

Hookers,2q2lyf,DoubleTroubleTime,3,Mon Dec 22 14:53:05 2014 UTC,"IMO the best way to do this would be to find an escort that advertises doubles and develop a good business relationship with her (see her a couple of times.) Then tell her about your fantasy, she can probably set up everything you want just the way you want.  Paying 2 women that you've never seen before and expecting them to set up your fantasy perfectly is less likely to happen.  edit:1sweetbaby4u"
Hookers,2q2lyf,masrne,2,Mon Dec 22 20:46:14 2014 UTC,"Less, not including the plane trip and hotel, correct?"
Hookers,2q2lyf,aspiringbirdwatcher,6,Mon Dec 22 19:45:26 2014 UTC,"Correct (to a certain extent.) If you're looking to book 2 ladies overnight, then actually it might be more expensive with the 2 ladies in the US.  Consider (price in USD):  Airfare: USA -> Manila, Philippines, $850-1200  Hotel:  $30 - $70/night, depending on needs. I was more than comfortable in $55/night hotel.  Outcall (all night, each) rate: 1000PHP (~$22) - 3500PHP(~$78).   Transport, depending on airport: $30 - $60  Food+Drink: Negligible. Cost of alcohol at a bar is around $1. Buying a drink for a girl is about $2.50  Maximum spend: $1200 + ($70 * 5) + (PRICE_PER_GIRL=80 * NUM_OF_GIRLS=2) + $60 =   ~$1770  I've seen the (posted) price of overnights for a lady all over the US on the low end of $800 and on the high end of $4000. Multiple that by 2, and if you're looking for an overnight it would actually be cheaper to do this 5 nights in a row in another country than 1 night in the city of your choice, if you choose the paid route."

Hookers,2q10yo,TheUppertaker,7,Mon Dec 22 02:20:56 2014 UTC,Never caught anything from a pro. Not even the ones I bare backed.  Five escorts in two years? That's one every five months. Not hardly an addiction!
Hookers,2q10yo,jtbrown1,1 point,Mon Dec 22 06:41:44 2014 UTC,"Lol, I thought he was gonna say fifth this week. Jeez you've got some serious self-control. It's pretty common for escorts to lube just as a preventative measure for future discomfort. Try DATY before you put on the cover and that should get her wet enough that lube won't be necessary right away. The rest is up to you."
Hookers,2q10yo,subiss1ck,2,Mon Dec 22 11:16:28 2014 UTC,"If I started 8 months ago and have done it like 20 times what does that make me????? :(  Also, OP: you should probably stop, but I think your complaints are silly. I mean, sure, the hookers are faking it 99% of the time, but it's not about her pleasure, it's about yours. I also personally think it feels better lubed up, though I must admit it is annoying if they stop you every couple of thrusts to lube more. And also, I'd advise you not to worry about ""being beta"" shit. Being beta is not doing what you want to do and makes you feel good just because of what some retards might think. If you want to cuddle that hooker you fucking cuddle that hooker. Fucking cuddle her like there's no tomorrow. You'll feel good, she'll feel good, and that's the end of the story. Just be very careful not to fall in love with a hooker, that almost never turns out well. Unless you're rich. But you seem to be able to keep your peace of mind pretty well, having done it only 5 times in 2 years. Just stop worrying and enjoy the ride."
Hookers,2q10yo,bredontopology,9,Mon Dec 22 12:10:48 2014 UTC,"Wow... This is like the exact opposite of what I am going through. I find my time with the providers I see to be some of the most stimulating, mind blowing connections and sex I've ever had. Are you spending your time with women who provide the GFE? Or are you just seeing the ones that fuck and peace out?   If you aren't happy, I would stop. Plain and simple. This isn't a lifestyle for a lot of people who haven't been through the shit of modern day relationships. You said you haven't had a girlfriend so I think that's one thing you need to consider. You have no reference point, which to me is really important. I've gone through about 4 really big relationships in my life, and they all came crashing down on me and left me physically and mentally sick. I had enough of that for the time being and find my time with escorts to be exactly what I want out of life. It's transactional in nature, but at least my emotional health is kept safe.   If it's a weight problem holding you back from getting a girlfriend, you can work on it. If it's a horrible disfigurement... well honestly it's tough out there. The dating world is not what our parents went through. It's a real dog eat dog type of world out there and you really need to be on top of your game if you want to pull those 7's, 8's, 9's, and especially those 10's.    Point is this though: You definitely need to stop. If you aren't happy, don't do it. Find a way to fix your lack of a girlfriend problem. Everyone needs to experience at least one atypical relationship in their lifetime. This is coming from someone who really isn't anything special in the looks department or money department either. If I can do it, you can definitely find a women who loves you for you and enjoys spending time with you."

Hookers,2q10yo,histrionic69,2,Mon Dec 29 01:03:43 2014 UTC,"It's true that we don't always feel pleasure, but as long as your provider consents to the job and you treat them respectfully there's no harm. You deserve to have a sex life even if you have to pay for it. If your options are to have no sex or have sex with someone you have to compensate I still think the better option is to pay for sex.   Perhaps quality over quantity is the key."
Hookers,2q10yo,healingvirgincunt8,1 point,Sun Dec 28 10:09:07 2014 UTC,"LOL  You dudes out there are AWARE that excellent providers cater to protecting you from the outside harms of daily life? If fucking isnt doing it for you, then tell her   ""Hey, meaningless sex leaves me at a funky and vulnerable emotional state, would you possibly consider or be interested in providing sessions where we keep our clothes on and cuddle/kiss/outercourse? I also hope you could consider NOT charging me (250-400) and hour to not take our clothes off and have intimacy. I'd also like to offer that I am comfortable booking multiple hours of this (we can hang out talk and eat or veg out in front of tv) so that you still get the (250-400) that you deserve.""  Women that do this because in their heart of hearts they feel good being able to be a medium for relaxation and acceptance will be not only flattered but genuinely interested and frank about what they stand.   :-)  Hope this helps, you cant be a push over when you are the one spending the cash. ADVOCATE for yourself, do not put yourself in fucked up predicaments simply because on the surface all dudes pretend thats all they need (therefore get) from hookers. I would personally prefer a billion more clients like you because my shining glory isnt just what I can do and how I look, its the fact that I have a huge heart and, as a consequence, true compassion and empathy for my dear friends that have found me in this lovely profession.

Hookers,2pweji,brthrowawayacnt,3,Sat Dec 20 19:24:56 2014 UTC,"Exactly.  Cops like the low hanging fruit.  It is much easier and safer from the cop's point of view to line up several johns to come to one place and get arrested than to try to send a decoy out to an unknown situation to entrap a guy.  Let's also remember that outcall is the high end of the industry and cops will focus on the low end.  The worst That could be expected to happen in an outcall situation would be a client list being exposed, usually because police busted an agency.  This doesn't prove anything legally but could be used to embarrass a client.  A client could lose his job.    Elliott Spitzer, the former governor of New York, was a client who was caught.  Although nothing happened to him legally, it ended his career as governor and exposed him as a hypocrite.  This fiasco did not happen because police were surveilling the call girl or the agency, but rather, because his bank reported excessive wire transfers from his account.  At first it was assumed to be campaign finance fraud."

Hookers,2pv24s,supermml,5,Sat Dec 20 05:42:53 2014 UTC,Always go the full hour. That will give the provider the chance to go through her routine properly. If she's any good. Also even if you blow you load quickly.  Just lay back and enjoy massage :-)

Have also been basically asked to leave after the first pop, even though its 20 mins in, and really, I could sit and argue for the next 30 minutes, but that's a losing situation all around.

Be freshly showered an hour or two before your appointment. Little to no cologne is preferable.   Set out her rate in an unmarked Envelop that's readily avaliable.   Bottled water is great as well if you can have a few bottles avaliable.   Discuss all activities you're wanting to do at the beginning of the appointment. Wear a condom for all sexual contact, including oral. If she doesn't make you wear a condom you don't want anything to do with her.  Relax and enjoy!"

Hookers,2oxrkk,BlueNewYork,1 point,Thu Dec 11 03:42:19 2014 UTC,"NYC are you kidding me?  Tons and tons of sex workers there, for every budget, style and kink.   As someone who has worked with law enforcement for a number of years, I can tell you: they go after the low hanging fruit.  Cops don't need to put up an elaborate ruse if they want to catch some johns.  They need only put an officer in heels on a street corner for a while and con the guys who stop into saying incriminating words.  They'll get plenty of arrests for that night, material to put on their own evaluation reports and perhaps even spin for some BS for the media about stopping sex trafficking and rescuing women.   So if you avoid the street-level sex work, and don't make brazen statements about sex for money, you will be fine.  And even in the unlikely event that an arrest happens?  Well, ever hear the saying that you can't con an honest man?  Likewise, it's really hard to prosecute and get a jury to convict someone who has done nothing shameful.  Probably 98% of johns arrest wind up being plea-bargained.  That's because cops and prosecutors rely on the shame factor.  They love to nab someone like a politician and assume that clients of prostitutes are sneaking around and cheating on wives.  If that's not what you are doing, they have nothing on you.  Assert your rights and whatever case will likely be dropped and forgotten."

Generally, a honeypot consists of a computer, data, or a network site that appears to be part of a network, but is actually isolated and monitored, and which seems to contain information or a resource of value to attackers.

Hookers,2oougk,manwhore25,2,Tue Dec 9 15:53:20 2014 UTC,"I got to wondering what is the longest time a relationship between a client and sexworker has lasted.   I've heard stories on boards where a relationship has lasted a long, long time. Not sure if this 'counts', but my longest relationship is over 5 years. I only see this girl VERY occasionally -- less than 10 times in the period I've known her, but I would call her a friend, if not a close friend.   She was one of the first few providers I ever saw in the hobby, and that session was the first one that had that 'illusion of passion', and really gave me a spring in my step after seeing her.  She doesn't live in the same city as me, and even when I hit town, I don't repeat with girls a whole lot since there's a whole lot out there. But I made a point to see her on an occasional basis.   I did her a solid a while back -- someone was using her pictures on another hobby board, and I let her know. One of the next few times I saw her, there was some confusion about her rate, and I was short some money -- she let it slide, and I made sure next time to make it up to her.   I tend to go for the eye candy girls, and she's gained some weight over the years, so it's kind of hard to justify spending the money on her when there's other well-reviewed providers.  Generally guys that are regulars with a provider often (but not always) can get 'bonuses' for being a good customer. It might be 'off the menu' items, but it's usually that the hobbyist is grandfathered in at the old rate when a provider's rates inevitably go up.  A guy out there might stick with one provider because he can trust her, she knows how to scratch the itch the right way or there's complicated feelings where he wants to remain 'monogamous'. I haven't read Brown's book yet, but I have a hard time believing that his 7 year 'monogamous' relationship with a provider was mutual."

Make him my only client for that week or so. He's been very good to me, even e-transferred me some money when he had to cancel a date. (Which I didn't ask him to do.)  I've also introduced him to a few of my romantic partners who were interested in trying sex work. He's very gentle, understanding, and doesn't pressure me to do anything I can't do.

However, don't get trapped. the second time don't tip. But as you become a repeat customer it is nice to give a little extra every once in a while. Tips also don't always have to be moeny. You can ask her when you talk to her if you can bring some food over. or bring her a small stack of flowers. I just follow the 10-20% rule or thereabouts. If she totally blows your mind then never let her catch on to that. And don't tip the first time. Also if you are going back then always be super nice and give her love.

You can't have a legally enforceable contract for illegal activities.  And a contract that says something like ""no, we're not having sex for money"" sounds fishy from the start."

If you're texting/calling a provider is it okay to use all the abbreviations I see here?   There is a provider near me that dresses up on request From what reviews said.

It's because you're seeing BP girls. They're fine in a pinch when you just need to get one out so you can move on with your day, but you gotta realize they're so jaded from constantly dealing with pricks all day. It's just an assembly line to get these assholes in and out so I can pay for my drug/alcohol habit. I don't go onto BP looking for sex; it's no more than an enhanced masterbation experience. If anything, after a good romp you should feel on top of the world.  If you were older, I would recommend doing some research and investing in a quality GFE experience. It's not always 100% authentic, but I'd be lying if I said that I didnt have some experiences that rivaled if not surpassed civie relationships. Then again I never dated any nymphomaniacs (and I assure you that many of these girls are and they just enjoy sex period). At your age and experience I don't know if it's a good idea though. It's easy to misinterpret the experience and chasing escorts is expensive and will lead you nowhere."

All women in some way or another are fucking you for your money. At leaset the exchange of money for sex is up front and you will know exactly what you are getting when you do it as a business. Also I agree that some women really do enjoy being a prostitute. I have been with many that seem to really enjoy what they do. It is not for everyone and some of them may not really like it but that does not mean you have to feel bad. We are all making choices as adults here. It is just sex.

Hookers,2o407a,4sumhookz,7,Wed Dec 3 02:03:40 2014 UTC,"Super new to the hobby, but its real hard to catch something orally. Kind of needs to be the perfect storm. The realistic transmission rate is pretty abysmal. The two most common things are herpes and the clap. Both are super treatable if need be.   If she has cold sores or any weird cuts or lesions in/around her mouth smart money says wrap it. If she doesn't then go for it you'll be safe an overwhelming majority of the time. You're more likely to be crushed by a vending machine than get HIV from oral."

Hookers,2o407a,TTTT27,2,Wed Dec 3 14:57:20 2014 UTC,There are STD's other than HIV.  Some can be spread by unprotected oral sex.
Hookers,2o407a,maudlin-for-autumn,6,Thu Dec 4 02:20:34 2014 UTC,sigh.  Yes that is true.  However the infection rate is extremely minimal.  And the STDs that can be passed on from oral sex ARE EASILY CURED WITH ANTIBIOTICS.   Rampant paranoia about STDs is a pet peeve.  If you're that scared then just go fap.
Hookers,2o407a,TTTT27,7,Thu Dec 4 15:28:01 2014 UTC,"STDs that can be passed on via oral sex include herpes and HPV.  Both of which are viral diseases.  Antibiotics will NOT cure a viral disease.  And by the way, there are ways to prevent STD transmission other than telling people to stay home and fap.  A barrier method - condoms or dental dams - prevents transmission, including oral transmission, quite well.  I would expect a sex worker, of all people, to be better informed about STDs and their prevention."
Hookers,2o407a,maudlin-for-autumn,2,Sat Dec 6 00:57:10 2014 UTC,"Ok, first of all, condescending tone not warranted or appreciated.    I am fully aware of the herp and HPV.  However, if you look at available data the risks are extremely low for HPV turning into anything bad, and herpes is fairly easy to avoid.  Also doing a lot of online research can be confusing and overwhelming, so you know who I turn to?  My doctor at planned parenthood.  She guides and supports me and if she tells me to be worried I will.     I was not saying to avoid STD transmission to stay home.  I was saying that if you're really that paranoid about it, stay home.    Like I've said in other STD-related posts, I've slept with a lot of men, given a lot of bbbj's, and I've never gotten sick.  Ever.  A lot of STD fears are, in my opinion, extremely overblown.    edit- but you are right.  I should not have said with emphasis that the std's the can be passed on from oral can be cured with antibiotics.  I should keep in mind that there are younger less experienced people on the sub who might take everything at face value.  so thanks for pointing that out."

Hookers,2o407a,BecomingReborn,1 point,Fri Dec 5 17:42:29 2014 UTC,"Good question. You can catch an std from receiving oral, but it is highly unlikely.   Syphilis, ghonnorea, chlamydia can all present orally, and she can spread it to you. With the exception of some virulent firms of ghonnorea, these are easily cured--though there may be complications as always, no be careful. At any rate, she will most likely feel ill if she has contagious oral chlamydia or gonorhea, and she will likely have clear sores if syphilis. And all three are rare diseases, but obviously more likely among cheap sex workers who offer bbbjs for like 10 bucks. A high class girl will require a condom or be getting regular check ups and screening the guys' dicks well.  HIV: almost no chance. It has to be a perfect storm.  HPV: could happen, not likely. And anyways it's not even a very bad disorder if you get it on your dick. Only certain strains can cause cancer and that's rare. Most strains will be out of your system with a couple years. Most likely you won't get a wart. That said, putting another woman (wife?) at risk for cervical cancer bc you had to get your bbbj fix is kind of douchey in my opinion... Just saying  Herpes: very , very low risk. If you don't have oral herpes, you could get it on your dick. But most likely you already have oral herpes. Regarding genital: it's very very rare to appear orally. It can occur, but usually there's one minor outbreak or none at all and it's not too contagious.   In general, if you see a high class escort who looks clean and looks like she screens well, im sure you'll be fine. I personally have gotten bbbj twice and I have no stds. But I don't really go for that very much."

Hookers,2o1w98,mrniceguy123,2,Wed Dec 3 04:03:18 2014 UTC,There are a lot of girls on backpage that wont ask for references. Are you in the US? Which state?

If you feel paranoid by it, chose a girl you would like to meet and google her number to see if she has ads on other websites, if she does then she may have reviews on those sites (unless she's new to the biz), then you know that she is legit.   Or instead of getting an escort, you can always find a really hot girl on  websites such as www.tempted.com and www.supermodelclub.com I have met a few gorgeous girls from there who wouldn't normally spend time with you if you weren't paying them. You might pay a bit more but you get to know the girls on a different level than an escort, and the sex is a lot better, more intimate."
Hookers,2o1w98,grackychan,2,Tue Dec 2 17:52:24 2014 UTC,Is the sex a given with those services ? Or will some of them take your money and want to bail when it comes down to it?
Hookers,2o1w98,tehfuntimesaccount,1 point,Wed Dec 3 03:33:32 2014 UTC,"I would get a P411 account and then search for a provider that's newbie friendly in your area.  P411 vets you so that the girl is almost certain you're not a LEO, and then a girl with several reviews should be pretty legit.  I say this because I was rolled in my initial attempt on backpage, and P411 provider probably wouldn't want the bad press if she's got an established review history.    1) Never mention acts for cash.  Usually a girl should try and kiss you and get you ""more comfortable"" right off the bat in addtion to being scantly clad herself.  I'd be wary of a girl who prompts you for what you want that isn't already rubbing her naked body against your naked body.  2) Look for ""newbie friendly"" providers.  Some review boards have this as a separate search criteria.  3)  That is a line to avoid getting busted 9 times out of 10.    Alternatively, you could look for an Massage Parlor in your area. Get naked, lay down, and wait to see if she gropes you.  If you get a legitimate massage, then that's okay too...    Though I've been to about two places that advertized as ""Asian Massage"" that didn't give a happy ending FWIW."

Hookers,2o22op,Hungmonger,2,Tue Dec 2 16:33:46 2014 UTC,"$100 does not necessarily make her suspect if she has been around for a while.   A lot of it depends on your location.  If you're in Silicon valley or the Bay Area and she has great reviews then yes I would consider it suspect. Bakpages is NOT a haven for high priced provider  ($250 +).  That doesn't mean you won't find a good quality provider, it just means a majority of prices will range between $80 specials to $200.   I suppose it depends on what you consider expensive or cheap.  But the keep in mind , ""If it's too good to be true, it always is"".  IF you do incall (which most of us do), no don't take condoms.  She should have them already.  Don't take you wallet or ID. Just your donation and car keys (if you drove).  If you don't feel comfortable, don't stay.  Simply state you changed your mind and leave.  Always trust your gut."

I'm not super long but I have a very girthy cock (a little above average in length but way above average in girth),  and I have special condoms I order from theyfit that are a better fit for me, also lube is more important for a guy like me.  Negotiating over the phone is another thing, some girls can take the girth and like it, others don't, but I'm not sure how to bring that up over the phone.    I thought about going and leaving stuff in the car, then when it checks out going back out to get it.  I dunno."
Hookers,2o22op,harfleur,2,Tue Dec 2 21:16:06 2014 UTC,"In your situation, I'd say to bring the condoms in with you. Far more suspicious to come in and out, and realistically if it's a sting you're going to get busted with or without them.  I wouldn't mention the size issue on the phone, since almost every girl will hang up as soon as specifics like that come up. Instead, bring it up as soon as you arrive and get comfortable. I'd guess most girls would be fine with it, but you don't want to waste too much time if they aren't."

I assume you know the game since you've done the P411 and screening, so all you really need to remember is be clean, respectful, and drop the envelope before the action starts.    Beforehand, just remember that you have done all you can so far to eliminate the risks involved.  As someone who took just the steps you are taking when starting, I wouldn't think you have much to worry about.   There are no guarantees, true, but if you let that fact influence your hobby decisions more than the other head, you should be fine.

Hookers,2o051u,gonefishin_,4,Tue Dec 2 02:11:39 2014 UTC,"Not many hotels will rent by the hour...those that will, make that very clear.   In some cases they will refuse due to local laws or to keep good relations with neighbors.  Nothing to stop you, of course, from renting a room and leaving when you're done with it.  Even high-end hotels, however, usually offer something called a 'day rate' - basically they'll rent the room for a day, ostensibly for those with an airplane layover or who just came in from a long flight and need to rest for the day.  Usually, the price is the same or almost the same as the regular overnight rate.   Hotels have an amazing business model in that their occupancy rate can be more than 100%"
Hookers,2o051u,TTTT27,2,Tue Dec 2 03:23:31 2014 UTC,"Generally you will have to settle with a ""Day"" rate.  Depending on the Hotel it can go from $65 to just over $100.  Now if you plan ahead ( by a day) you can get the room cheaper through Priceline.com or some other discount website for 4 or 5 star hotels for under $90.

Even now, it's always a more comfortable and relaxed environment, and it's rarely rushed.   As was noted, be aware that most AMPs a are, with good reason, very paranoid. One thing most do is to be prepared when they ask if you've been there before. The answer should always be yes, but it was a few years ago. Next they'll ask who you saw. Then say, ""I don't remember exactly, but I think it was May or Mai or something? I'm sorry, I just don't recall from that long ago.""

Leave on nearest desk when entering incall location and she'll ask me to ""freshen up?"" or ""use the restroom"" while she validates the cash?   This varies. If she doesn't have specific instructions on her website or ads, just set it down as soon as you enter. Don't mention it or talk about it. Just do it.    so I assume she has the condoms?   Pros will always have condoms. If she doesn't, she's either not very professional, trying to up sell you to bareback sex (don't ever do this!) or trying to get out of actually having sex with you.   Some ladies will allow you to use your own condoms if you bring them, some won't.    Let her initiate? Squeeze her ass when I enter to let her know i'm not a cop?   Unless she specifics on her website or ad, it doesn't matter. Keep in mind though that ""squeezing her ass"" does not prove you're not a cop.   Can I cum in condom inside her? Not trying to be cool and cum on her tits or whatever, cumming inside a condom sounds hot to me.   I usually ask ""where can cum?"" once we are well into the session. If you want something specific she doesn't mention, just ask. If she says ""no"", don't do it. I've never had a provider not say ""inside the condom"" first. I have heard stories of providers who do not like though. Again, just ask. If she says ""no"", don't do it.   Am I supposed to tip? is that expected of me to tip? Say i'm paying 150 for half hour full service, am i supposed to assume 150+tip with this?

Doesn't have to be long, I spend a minute to get wet and dry off. Walk out with the towel on and just get right into the action. I save the introductions for after the first pop.  They know you're gonna bang them. Get the cash into their hands, so they feel comfortable you aren't a cop or dangerous. Coming out clean from the shower is a plus too. I always use to wait for them to initiate, but sometimes an introduction can last 10-15 mins because they're waiting on you to make the move.

Hookers,2ncg0n,i_am_a_perv,1 point,Sun Nov 30 16:02:29 2014 UTC,One of the forums let you search by provider ad location. Almost half the stuff I've read on those forums are for rub and tug places in Queens. You're not too far from other parts of NYC either.
Hookers,2n89un,Loveyoulongtime9,5,Mon Nov 24 03:40:49 2014 UTC,"Lurker here, but I thought I'd create an account to help answer this question, mainly since it seems you didn't get any responses and I have visited Amsterdam's redlight numerous times:   Do any providers let you videotape the session?   Yes, but ask upfront. In the redlight area you won't be able to find many. However, there are places to look, such as www.kinky.nl. You can actually search on the site for girls who let you videotape or take photos.  Are there any shemales that are available outside of the Red Light District?   Yes, there are. In fact, Rotterdam is a large selection of prostitutes, just check Kinky.nl. As for inside De Wallen (the real name for the redlight area), you find most on street called Molensteeg.  I'd prefer to have a longer session maybe at a brothel/apartment and as I understand it the RLD is mainly for tourists.   De Wallen is a tourist trap. I do not recommend going in the weekends and evenings, it is completely filled with tourists. Often filled with drunk and/or stoned people. In fact, many of the younger crowds will often cheer you on when you are talking with a girl and even give a warcry when you enter. It's annoying. If you go, go during the weekdays or in the weekend before 20:00. Downside is that a lot of the best girls only come out at night. One piece of advice with De Wallen is don't expect great sex, expect to cum, since often girls will give you two condoms on and wrap kitchen paper around your dick to cover your pubes. My recommendation is really try to go with 2-3 De Wallen girls, then hit up the ladies on Kinky.nl  What brothels do you generally recommend?   The real brothels are really in decline, at least in De Wallen. The Dutch government has imposed stricted regulations on the trade and the amount of windows with girls. This means compared to 5-10 years ago when you had 300-500 girls to choose from, you now have maybe 80-100. As for actual recommendations, it doesn't matter which one you choose, since almost all the rooms look the same, what matters is the girl.  Are there better prices in the Hague (short train ride away)?   No, the price is usually 80 Euros per 15 minutes with short BJ and quick fuck in one position. If you want more you need to pay. However, do not enter the room until you have settled on a price with the girl. This is critical! First time I went, I did not know this and ended up paying 300 Euros (the girl was amazing), but I could have paid less, much less for the same like 150 Euro.. If you want alternatives, check Kinky instead (www.kinky.nl) the selection of girls is much better. You won't find anything like De Wallen outside of Amsterdam anymore, since most larger redlight areas have been shut down. The advantage is that it has all moved online (check kinky.nl for the girls) and into often better and nicer places. If you really want a unique experience then head over to Cologne (Koln) and visit Pascha http://www.pascha.de/koeln/ It is a giant brothel, it is amazing!  I'm also open to any other advice of things to do in Amsterdam while I'm not having sex as I can cum maybe twice in a day maximum!   Other stuff to do: Visit museums, smoke weed, do mushrooms, buy cocaine on the street, visit a gaybar, visit a catcafe (Kattencafé Kopjes), take a trip on the channels. If you go to Pascha, drive there and visit some of the famous WWII sites, like Eindhoven.    If you need any more information, just let me know. Happy to help."
Hookers,2n89un,EuroJohn,2,Tue Nov 25 07:54:33 2014 UTC,"When I said brothels I was referring to private houses like http://www.asmara.nl as they seem to be 110 euros an hour, but I have no idea if they'll try to up sell me.   Thanks for getting back to me!"
Hookers,2n89un,EuroJohn,2,Tue Nov 25 17:18:28 2014 UTC,Private houses will try to upsell. The website price is usually only for short BJ and sex in one or two positions. If you want more you need to pay 50-100 Euros more.
Hookers,2n89un,unhealthyadvice,2,Wed Nov 26 10:56:19 2014 UTC,"One piece of advice with De Wallen is don't expect great sex, expect to cum, since often girls will give you two condoms on and wrap kitchen paper around your dick to cover your pubes.   For real?  Like they put one condom on your cock and then another one over that to double layer it?  That is pretty ridiculous and would make the whole thing kind of pointless for me as I don't think I'd be able to feel a thing."
Hookers,2n89un,EuroJohn,1 point,Wed Nov 26 12:10:52 2014 UTC,"Yes. Double-condoms and kitchen paper. Now you can pay extra for one condom only, it is 20-50 extra.  I do not really get any enjoyment out of going to De Wallen, at least not sexually. Although, it is nice to see all the girls in the windows and some of them are extremely sexy.  I still fall for it when I am there, simply because I want to have sex with a beautiful girl."

You basically agreed to pay her for a non-sexual date.  It doesn't matter if she wasn't very good at it or if you didn't enjoy it.  You should pay her.

Hookers,2mmmgt,evafha,5,Thu Nov 20 02:46:28 2014 UTC,I don't know. I have done it a few times with mixed results. If you have not done it by all means do it for bragging rights but it depends on the type of thing you are into. If they are really good friends then it works out better but if they are just working friends it gets strange sometimes. The best situation I have ever had with this was a sister twin package. They did not care if I did not take off and put on different condoms when I switched up. A lot of girls will make you switch for obvious reasons. I hate condoms anyway so to switch just makes it suck for me. Ask that specific question if you are planning such a fling. I also had a great time with some hookers in Okinawa Japan where I was fucking one and the other was eating my ass. I asked for that and they did it. But in general I like one on one sex. I don't mind if someone else is there to watch and they can even be naked and such but I don't like working on two people it takes away from my own personal fantasy that is flying around in my head. I also have to say that sitting around doing coke off hookers that are all naked together is a fun time but I usually still only end up fucking just one of them. Well thats it for me.

I don't recall seeing anything ""unique"" yet in all my travels.   It's rare but I do occasionally see working girls hanging out in 5 star hotel bars.   But not very often."

Hookers,2mphyt,unhealthyadvice,1 point,Sat Nov 22 03:18:03 2014 UTC,"Every once in a while there's a motel that gets so much action that it kind of turns into a brothel.  I think it starts off with them being indifferent to the fact that there are more than a few girls using them for incalls.  But then it gets to a point that there are so many johns walking around, that some girls realize they can get walk-in traffic if they leave their windows or doors open when they're not busy.  Once word gets out, it gets a bit crazy; but then of course LE has to bring the hammer down so it never lasts more than a few weeks.  Another interesting place I've heard about is that there is a bit of action to be found at a public hot tub nearby.  It's in a strip mall and they charge like $40/hr, but they take cash so illicit rendezvous are par for the course there.  But I guess some guys have said that they've had some luck parking outside and waiting for a girl that's just finished or one that's been stood up."
Hookers,2mnvhn,nono__,7,Tue Nov 18 13:34:46 2014 UTC,Most don't use their own photo. But most of the time they look very close to that photo. I think when they are choosing a photo to use they think of the ideal of what they think they look like and post something close. I have never walked out on a girl but I have asked her to change the price for wrong adverts. And they usually give a little discount because they don't want you to leave. I have also fucked some of the best girls I have ever fucked off of Backpage. And if fact now that MRB is gone Backpage has upped their game and the girls are using more of their real photos. I basically feel that their life is hard enough already. It is not a candy shop and they have to protect themselves so I just give them the benifit of the doubt. You are not picking out your next girlfriend here just a fuck but it could work out that you marry her you just never know.

Hookers,2mnvhn,hookerthrow22,2,Wed Nov 19 00:06:53 2014 UTC,"Basically they're expecting you to be too horny to leave, which is most of the cases I bet. In my experience, this industry is ""you get what you pay for"". BP is a good source for a cheap quick experience, sometimes you can find a diamond in the rough... but more often than not, the picture and person you see will be their very best and outdated (so do your own re-calibration in your head on what they will truly look like). For BP, I normally go with the person who looks to be the most real, as I value reliability and service over some pipe-dream model selling herself for $100/hr. If it's too go be true, it probably is - either service was never disclosed and they want more $$ or terribly fake picture."

A lot of them believe that if they post pictures from the chest down men are can't tell the difference.  If she's very similar to the picture, I'm on with it.  If the girl is delusional ( picture is of a size 4 and she's a size 14) I politely walk out.    I will agree Backpages is slowly getting better.  I believe more hobbyist are walking out on fakes which helps police the community.  The last few I came across were great finds so I don't get upset unless I traveled far and found out she was fake."

Don't be shy, you're the customer.  If she doesn't provide the service you desire keep looking for one who does.  Many professional providers who make a VERY good living doing this will stay for the entire hour and are very pleasant.  I have met plenty who offered wine and fruit upon entry (if she hosts) and they make is a date."
Hookers,2mmwxd,malibijones,1 point,Tue Nov 18 16:08:42 2014 UTC,"Depends on the girl. Of course she can get dressed and leave, but that doesn't make her a good escort. A good escort will only leave before your paid for hour is done if she is asked to leave, or given the hints that it's time to go.  Asking about MSOG is the easiest way to figure this out.  Admittedly, some girls get dressed after the first orgasm based on their past experiences. So it makes sense on both sides.  Communication is best in this situation. Just ask her!"

Hookers,2mc0g8,mg03throwaway,2,Fri Nov 14 23:48:28 2014 UTC,"Unless it is specifically a bi-double experience, most paid threesomes are not that interesting. Especially if you only have an hour.  The only legit great experiences I have had were with established escorts, who were working with a good friend, or another 'natural'. They have to have a personal relationship, or just be skilled enough to drop their inhibitions and jump into the circus ring.  The best time I had was with two established escorts, a Japanese and a Russian, who had no sexual attraction to each other as such, but they were professionally competitive, and both were trying to make the other get off and lose their shit. I wasn't the focus of attention at all. I was just another weapon in their arsenal, and gladly followed orders.  I have only had one or two spectacular threesomes, a few adequate performances, and a whole lot of tag team. This is particularly true with Eastern European girls. I did some overnights and even a 4 way, and it was mostly tag team action, with 1 or 2 other girls hanging out in your hotel room while you went at it. With Chinese and Thai, it is normally just as disconnected, but the other girl often massages you while you are in action. Best massage ever, I suppose.  Separate appointments is a much better deal. You get one on one attention for the duration, and then you get somebody new. I am leaving my land of cheap legal brothels soon, so that has been my thing at the moment. I pay for 2-4 sessions, depending on how many new girls there are, and there is a knock on the door and a fresh face every hour. There is something hot about the role reversal, with me set up in the room, and a queue of random strangers at the door."

Hookers,2mc0g8,HotPandaLove,2,Sat Nov 15 03:38:47 2014 UTC,"I started out in Prague, Ukraine (Kiev, Dnepropetrovsk) and Latvia where i worked on projects for a few years. Around 5-6 years ago, things were pretty wild. Most 'business hotels' would have girls in bars, but on the river in Kiev was a nightclub in a boat that had a whole bar that was specifically for escorts. The agencies in the region are a lot more cost effective though. Same girls, without the hassle of going to an Eastern European night club full of mafia and expats on drug benders. Some of my work colleagues got 'involved' with local women and usually ended up getting ripped off or extorted. And we were doing 'turnaround' on dysfunctional companies (i.e. consulting on restructuring) so getting involved with the locals I was working with added... unnecessary complication.  Now I regularly visit Sydney/Melbourne in Australia, and Auckland, NZ. In NZ and Australia, sex work is legal, so girls stick around and get a 'personal brand'. You can walk into a brothel, but independent incall escorts advertise openly. It is great punting, truly world class. Last time I was in Auckland, I had 10 sessions in 7 days. I am kind of odd in that I live in South East Asia, but travel to Australia and NZ for sex tourism. Australia is probably on a price parity with the US, but NZ is around 30% more cost effective. In New Zealand (like many countries) any girl who 'has what it takes', tends to move to the most prosperous city.  I now live in Singapore, where there is one of the great red light districts of the world, so there are a thousand or so girls in legal brothel set ups, a lot of which are modern and quite classy. It is also US$80-12 for an hour, which is why I am trying to enjoy myself as much as possible before I move country at Christmas. If you fly through Singapore for any reason, the red light district is about 10-15 minutes away from the airport by cab. I have been quite busy (got involved with a girlfriend), so haven't been getting in many regular sessions. So I normally take 1 or 2 saturdays a month and spend an afternoon/evening there. It is great actually. Between sessions there is street food and cheap beer. It is well worth a visit, much better than the international girls who work out of nightclubs here. There is also a big 'illegal' scene of Asian (Korean, Thai, Chinese, and a surprising number of Fillipino transexuals) and Russian girls working out of hotel rooms here, as well as legit high end international escorts (mainly UK and Australian) coming through on tour. At the moment, the retail convenience of the brothels suits me, but I see a high end touring girl every couple of months through a regular agency. I have been in Asia 5 years, so now have a non-Asian fetish.  The world is your oyster!"

Hookers,2m420o,xoprovider,2,Sat Nov 15 07:04:45 2014 UTC,"Here's a rough outline of my experiences.  1 - 2010 - Late 30s, early 40s white chick - fake, but very well done boobs. Beautiful face, excellent body. Brunette from Texas, looked like a former cheerleader. She was very nice, but professional and not ""warm"". BBBJ, and some missionary. The only escort I've ever kissed. Saw her once more before she retired and moved out of state.  Looks: 8/10  Experience: 9/10   2 - 2010 - Mid 40s white chick - overweight, big natural boobs. She was quite nice and gave more of a GFE vibe. Incall was at her house, which was a little weird. I had a fun time and she didn't charge much but she wasn't exactly a model. BBBJ, 69, cowgirl  Looks: 5/10  Experience: 7/10  3 - 2011 - Early 20s white chick. Cute, small face, nice body, very petite, small boobs and a taut brown ponytail. She was nice but a bit detached. She had a scar on her chest which seemed the reason she was a bit shy about taking her top off. She told me I was very nice and gentle which made me a bit sad, thinking of what other experiences she must have had. BJ with condom and doggy.  Looks: 7/10  Experience: 6/10  4 - 2011 - Early 20s black chick. Her pictures were very misleading-- definitely old and at strange angles, possibly even photoshopped. She was overweight and her boobs were not as nice as pictured. She was friendly but pretty businesslike. BJ with condom, missionary, and the weirdest-- a HJ with a condom on. Took me forever to bust from that one. She was a great value though-- think I popped two or three times.  Looks: 4/10  Experience: 7/10  5 - 2011 - Late 30s white chick - She was a cutie with curly brown hair, a slightly large nose and a lean body. First and only time I've done outcall (to my university apartment no less!) Very nice, great conversation, really made me feel comfortable. Unfortunately I came literally within seconds of her getting on top. She actually seemed disappointed-- like maybe she was in it for the sex, or the adventure to some degree, not just the money. Memorable, but the worst bang for buck experience I had (get it?).  Looks: 7.5/10  Experience: 6/10  6 - 2011 - Early 20s white chick. Nice, big natural boobs and a cute face. On the thicker side, but not fat (wide hips). She was blonde and not very professional. Her friend was in the room and she asked if I minded if she stayed-- which I did. She wasn't very friendly (""Is it even up yet?"" she remarked about my obviously soft pre-boner penis), but she had a nice body and sucked decently. She had a pretty cheap rate as well. I saw her again, at which point she was a tiny bit friendlier. BBBJ, missionary.  Looks: 7/10  Experience: 7/10  7 - 2012 - Early 30s Latina chick. - Amazing big natural boobs. A normal, but cute face. A soft body, not thin-- but not fat or even ""thick"", just very curvy and womanly with a nice butt. You can probably tell I really liked her. She was very nice and unassuming, talked to me a little about her life. She was patient as I licked her beautiful pussy to probably no effect (which I probably wouldn't do with most escorts). BBBJ the first time (she used a condom from then on), doggy, missionary, DATY. I think she's GFE enough to kiss but I've been a bit shy (think I've seen her 3 times?).  Looks: 9/10  Experience: 9/10  For me there is definitely a difference between cheap and classy hookers (not relating to price)-- it's something you may be able to sense from pictures, postings, etc. but you won't necessarily know 100% until you see them in person.  Another thing that ties into that is the attitude they have and the environment in which they perform. A friendly, relaxed attitude goes a long way. Clockwatchers, escorts who never smile, or make even the most modest attempt at being alluring-- these are the worst qualities.  Similarly, I don't like going to an escort's home for a session. It's just uncomfortable. Messy hotel rooms, ""friends"" being present, or a hotel in a bad neighborhood are also bad signs.  Long story short, it seems like a lot of the black escorts care less about things like this (though they may be more open sexually and price-wise; I always see them advertising greek, BBBJ, and even BBFS along with pretty cheap specials). Furthermore, where I live, there are simply more black escorts than those of any other race (it's at least 2 or 3 to 1). So I'm not too surprised with your experience.  As far as fake or photoshopped photos, I see this absolutely everywhere, regardless of the race. Some of the Asian parlors are pretty bad about this (posting pictures of famous JAV models, for instance).  My best experiences have been with older (30s, 40s) providers-- one was white and one was Latina (though obviously born or raised in the USA). I think you're right in that they know what men want, and most of them are mature enough to realize that in the end it is a profession, and certain standards are expected from the best, most professional workers. Just because you're letting me touch your pussy doesn't mean I should worship you, basically-- no matter how hot you are.  It's nice to hear you've had good experiences with Asian girls. I've always been a bit wary since they seem pretty businesslike (around here most of them work for parlors or have some kind of male booker/go-between), but I've never had a session with one so I can't say.  EDIT: Almost forgot.   How do you feel about so called ""non-pros""?  I think that term can cover a pretty wide variety of providers. Generally though, I think it's a positive. While I don't have a problem with ""professional"" hookers (there's a difference between professional and cold/businesslike), escorts like the last lady I saw are a big plus to me because it was pretty obvious from talking to her that she was just a pretty normal lady that was doing sex work for whatever reason-- she wasn't really a ""hooker"". She would never stand on the street, and would probably do sex work for however long (her first postings are from ~2011 and she stopped posting a few months ago), and return to her normal life. She was always very clean and just had this vibe I can't put my finger on, that made her a lot better to be with than the other girls."

There is a stereotype of escorts as being 'LA porn', but the truth is they are just normal women when naked.  After a while, you start to get a disconnect, not just between 'love' and 'sex', but between what you find attractive in a partner, and what you find pleasurable. I can have deeply pleasurable sexual experiences with women who are far from my 'type'. In fact, I am guilty of seeking out novel nationalities, and unusual body types, out of curiosity. The category of women that I would be perfectly OK having purely physical sex with is pretty wide.

Now in US, or unrelated countries it's down to the whore you're with. If it's a meth whore that you picked up from the street, then CBJ is a good idea. If it's a hot looking college girl in a fancy hotel, then maybe BBBJ. Honestly, you have to decide in the situation with the girl.  But we all know that sex feels better with no condom.."

Normally escorts who offer BBBJ get tested every so often (at least that's what they told me).   Second and third question you're gonna have to talk to the provider (in person) about it. If she does then great. If not then you're probably gonna have to get down to business early (unless you whack off before meeting her).

Telling her you slept with hookers is useless. It WILL give the wrong impression of you to her, and you will NOT be able to win the correct impression back ever again. Whereas, saying you experienced several ""unsatisfactory flings"" will give the right impression without forcing you to lie.  Maybe if you just said you tried it once out of sheer curiosity but decided never to do it again that would work. But in that case you're actually lying, because obviously you did enjoy it.

The few sites that I can say that have the most updated content would be:  Backpage.com and their escort section even though is not RB or the old Craigslist erotic section is the closest we have to RB as far as the latest updated ads and the one that has the most ladies and updated contact info since ladies are updating their ads all the time.  Eccie.com - Forum Style, classifieds and reviews  eros.com - Escort Classifieds many of the ladies here have ads on BackPage or BP what ladies have been known to call it.  cityvibe.com - Escort Classifieds just a pain to find what you're looking for also a lot of old ads with outdated information.  Slixa.com - Escort classifieds.  eroticbits.com - Free escort classifieds, new and always showing the latest updated ads.  aperfectsin.com - Escort Social Network and classifieds FREE.  Humaniplex.com - Escort Social Network which is mainly for the OC area and really hard to use, not only that you will have to pay a 1 time fee to interact with others or get verified by the community etc...  allqts.com - search engine which indexes many ads from some of the above sites  From that we go to Review sites which are a little like forums.  Theeroticreview.com - One of the best  Bigdoggie.net   NaughtyReviews.com  adultfax.com - part of cityvibe to compliment their classified's site.

Hookers,2lg6cf,manslutalt,4,Fri Nov 7 03:12:08 2014 UTC,"Patong is the main town for it on the Phuket peninsula. I would recommend Pattaya instead if you can, but there's certainly action to be found in Patong.  Bangla Road is the biggest and busiest area, but there's also a quieter area a bit to the south and away from the beach if Bangla Road is too noisy for you. Tuk-tuks are pretty expensive in Phuket so if you stay in walking distance from Bangla Road you can save some money on that.  Don't let people from the street persuade you to do anything or go anywhere with them. I let someone persuade me to see a ping pong show and it was just a waste of time and money. Ping pong shows can be an interesting novelty but if you're going to see one at least make sure it's a good one.  Do try to find out if your hotel has a policy against bringing unregistered visitors to your room. I've done my research and haven't had a problem.  Don't leave cash or valuables in your room for the girl to steal. Don't pay the girl in advance, and if she wants to leave your room earlier than agreed, give her less money than agreed.  And of course use protection."

Hookers,2lev3x,throwawayallhookers,7,Wed Nov 5 22:27:25 2014 UTC,"Honestly I'm not sure if you got unlucky or if I've just had good experiences.   If she took her attention off of you at any point in the evening then you got yourself a bad escort. If I were you I would try to let the experience go, as dwelling on it will only stress you out. Yes you paid her for her services, but sometimes there's such an extreme lack of chemistry between two people that even an exchange of money for services can't overcome it. This isn't her fault and it sounds like by being high you kind of put her in a shitty situation. Both of you probably could have handled this better.   That said, my best experience (very recent actually) resulted from taking a few measures that I would recommend to you.   1) If the sex is a big deal to you, don't cram it in around the rest of your plans. Plan around your ""date"". Sure it might make you a little more nervous and seem less spontaneous but it will allow you to ensure you can follow the next few steps.  2) Book your girl early. Obviously if you're getting a sex worker she's going to have likely put some hours in before she got to you - but if you're towards the beginning of her evening she's less likely to be tired and more apt to give you a good show.   3) Get cleaned up. Shower, shave, brush your teeth. Put on a nice shirt. Make sure you smell good. As close to her arrival as possible. All of these things will make you more approachable and will make it easier for her to get at ease with you. The nicer you smell and the cleaner you seem the more likely she is to get as close as humanly possible to you. No going out and drinking and getting sweaty out about town. This girl doesn't love you or lust after you and doesn't want to play with your unwashed junk. Your responsibility as a john is to make it as easy as possible for her to do her job.   4) Don't scrimp. Nothing of any substance is possible in 30 minutes unless you're looking for just a blowjob. Pay for the hour and spend a little time chatting and getting comfortable with each other. 60 minutes is plenty of time to chit chat, get naked and have a great time. 30 minutes is only enough time to get off and you'd be doing it rushed and cold and almost totally impersonally.   Every girl will be different. These aren't hard rules, but simple guidelines. If you're clean, respectful and kind there's a good chance that you can have a good time. Sex is also a rarity and a big deal for me. I'm acutely aware that things I want and need most from physical intimacy aren't there with a pro. If this is a similar case for you and you feel the need to rely on escorts to partially fulfill these needs, then make sure you're doing everything you can to meet in the middle."
Hookers,2lev3x,I_Am_The_Mole,1 point,Wed Nov 5 23:02:54 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the advice.   I didn't skimp though, I paid £140 for an hour and was freshly showered with clean clothes. I just think the girl didn't particularly enjoy her job and works for a pretty crappy agency. Out of interest I've looked at the agencies website a few times since and shes been working everyday I've checked and usually on 12 hour shifts, it was about 5am when I saw her and she'd already been working for 11 hours. I still had a good time though, getting naked with and playing with some 9/10 model material girls tits while she plays with your dick while you're wired is a pretty great experience.   I live quite close to a larger city that has a much better reputation and has about 10 reputable agencies if it happens again then I will book a room there for the sole purpose of getting an escort with no drugs, no more than a few drinks and with a girl who I can find a review for online."
Hookers,2lev3x,Nicoleea,5,Wed Nov 5 23:19:58 2014 UTC,"My suggestion is, if you really want to enjoy it, don't do anything prior to meeting up with your escort. I had a guy a couple of nights ago who had never hired an escort before and was a little bit nervous. So between booking me and showing up at my apartment, he had done a few lines of coke and was apparently drinking doubles of scotch. By the time he got  to me, it took about the first 30 minutes to get him hard. I pulled out all the stops and it took ages, but I finally got him hard enough to roll on a condom. By the time the condom was fully on, he was already soft again. After another 10 minutes, I was about ready to give up and he's just like ""Fuck it, I just wanna cuddle.""  Generally, if you want a quality experience, you should be willing to pay a little bit more. I'd also look at the independents rather than those in an agency. I'm an indie and I know quite a few others like me. Because we get the full amount from customers (less a fee to drivers if it's an outcall) we generally don't have to take on as many customers a night so we're able to give you our full attention and we're not tired or uninterested. We also don't have the pressure of an agency constantly down our throats to go through as many customers as possible. Most independents (there are always exceptions) only take on 1 or 2 customers a day.   You just need to plan it in advance next time. Do a little bit of research and I would suggest looking at sites where independents have to pay to advertise. Generally with sites like backpage, you may find one or two diamonds in the rough but for the most part it's just disappointments and people who book 5 or more customers a night back to back and have no energy by the end."

Hookers,2lev3x,manslutalt,3,Wed Nov 5 22:47:21 2014 UTC,"it wasn't the girl in her pictures but she was a 9/10 and probably more to my tastes anyway so I wasn't bothered.   That's a bad sign, but unfortunately very common. My best experiences have always been when it's the same girl as in the picture.   Her profile said she was Italian but she seemed more Eastern European   Probably Romanian. I guess they get more business by pretending to be Italian.   This happened a couple more times throughout the session and just about the only things she said the entire time were complaints about how many jobs the agency were trying to make her do.   Wow, what a shitty agency. And yet it seems they get more than enough business..   When I ask myself how I feel about what happened what comes to mind was that it was fun, but also empty and awkward.   In my experience, it can often get a bit awkward. The cure for that is to try different girls until you find one it's not awkward with and keep seeing her."

The cure for that is to try different girls until you find one it's not awkward with and keep seeing her.   This is a great tip. Or, sometimes, even seeing the same one again, even though previously awkward, will be less so now that you have some familiarity. But you know, providers are people too, and sometimes you have to see a few before you meet one that meshes with your personality."
Hookers,2lev3x,malibijones,2,Wed Jan 14 07:32:38 2015 UTC,"Depends on the guy.  For me too much alcohol means lack of blood flow for erection.  Then the fact that rubbers make me go soft as well...

Hookers,2l8u8p,slightlytainted,6,Tue Nov 4 09:19:11 2014 UTC,I think it's the idea that sex is so easily accessible that is making you want more. I know because I had that same problem. If you're able to not call them for a day then you can do so for X amount of days (that's how I look at it). If that temptation comes to call an escort then rub one out first and if you're feeling that you still want more then call one.   As far as an escorts poking condoms I highly doubt they would. The last thing they want is a pregnancy or an STD that would force them to stop making money.
Hookers,2l8u8p,AnonThorAway,5,Tue Nov 4 09:19:20 2014 UTC,"Don't use your savings.  At the very worst, do something for more disposable income and only use that. Some people drive Uber or some shit for that.  Don't ruin your financial life for pussy. Pussy will always be there."
Hookers,2l8u8p,0xE2,2,Wed Nov 5 18:48:40 2014 UTC,"Budget, budget and more budget.  Don't touch savings for this.  If you feel weak, transfer your savings to a money market savings account at a different bank (Capital One 360 as an example) separate from your bank.  Why?  Cause it takes 2-3 business days for the money to transfer between accounts... you should have regained your senses long before the money becomes available again.  Either limit yourself to what your disposable income can handle, or start getting cheaper services.  I have traveled around the bay area and you can do better than $300 ""IF"" you want quantity over top note quality.   You may find providers just starting out between 100-200.  Place an add in Local Backpages and see what responses you get.   You might be surprised."
Hookers,2l8u8p,malibijones,2,Thu Nov 6 18:14:32 2014 UTC,"How much is too much, well when you spend more than 30% of your disposable income on whores, then it's too much. Never dip into savings to pay for whores, never!"

To be honest, I tend to take breaks from hobbying when I meet other girls in coffee shops and chat with them like normal friends. So it balances my whole social dynamic, I have female friends and sometimes I fuck escorts because they know what I want. Like I got a female friend who looks like Anna Kendrick and wears tight yoga pants I can clearly make out her panties and I act like a stone cold rock.  If I were you, I'd try to make a schedule of how long can you go without seeing an escort for and try to stick with it and if it's not an painful experience then I'd say it's not an addiction.   Money, you might want to at least budget yourself and negotiate when ever possible. There's a lot of girls who will go ""yeah 120 for 45 minutes is okay."" I've been seeing a girl with a killer body every now and then she charges reasonable rates.  Fear of STD, see a clinic just release the stress your putting yourself through.

So I don't feel any guilt about paying escorts for sex.  As for worrying about STDs, I put it in the same category as all other concerns about my health and wellbeing.  I evaluate the risks, minimize them where I can, and choose a balance between safety and enjoying my life.  Everyone will assess the risks and benefits at a level unique to themselves, so where that balance is found will be different for everyone.  It's entirely reasonable to decide for yourself that the risk is unacceptable and that you would prefer to have sex only with a long term monogamous partner.  If you make that choice, I only ask that you don't become one of those twits who feel they need to decide for everyone else what is safe and/or morally acceptable."

Hookers,2l7gvf,manslutalt,8,Wed Nov 5 19:08:24 2014 UTC,"You got the wrong impression. It's not zero risk, it's not high risk, it's low risk. How do I deal with it? I don't do high risk activities. High risk activities to me mean unprotected PIV or anal. Other people may have different thresholds for what risk they accept. Keep in mind that HIV, which is the big scare factor for most people, is pretty difficult to transmit even without a condom. With a condom the risk is extremely small.

I feel its only logic for me to catch something from this to pay for risking my life for such a dumb mistake. Everywhere I go, I start to see signs of the worst possible scenario. Even though i tested negative through the two in home tests I did, I get the biggest fear whenever I see anything STD related in the news, internet, or TV."

Nothing to be ashamed about, just keep your personal life and your social life separate.  The feeling that you betrayed your character and cheated yourself is a matter between your ego and your rational mind. You need to knock your ego down a few pegs and be more pragmatic. Sex makes people happy, guilt makes people unhappy. Why do you let your ego guilt trip you like an abusive mother?"

They aren't going to shame you at the doctor's office, they do this dozens of times a day and are ethically/legally bound to protect your privacy.  Then research a bit - sounds like you already have - and decide what risks you are willing to take.  Life is full of risks, but somewhere between the spectrum of no sex, and unprotected encounters with strangers, find the where you can satisfy your wants and minimize your risk."
Hookers,2l7gvf,jtbrown1,1 point,Tue Nov 4 03:36:56 2014 UTC,"Totally agree.   Chances are OP, you're fine. However if you wanna be 100% sure go to a clinic and do a full STD screening like what /u/TTTT27 said"
Hookers,2l7gvf,0xE2,5,Tue Nov 4 03:43:18 2014 UTC,"To the OP, the fact that you wrote all this says to me you shouldn't be in this ""hobby."" Most of us don't feel guilty and shame after a session, we feel excitement and pleasure. I look back with happiness on the sessions I had, and actually feel sorry for the dudes that haven't had the experiences I have had in the pay for play arena.  My personal opinion is that most sex workers are more concerned about their health than the average girl out partying on a Saturday night.  I think you should stay away from whores and focus on regular relationships with other single people."
Hookers,2l7gvf,manslutalt,2,Tue Nov 4 15:31:51 2014 UTC,"I agree and I admit that. This isn't for me, in my head i feel like this is the riskiest thing I've done, I put my life at stake for an hour of pleasure. But as i mentioned on other comments, my surprise moreso comes from others not feeling the same way I did. Seems like everyone enjoys the hobby (as yourself) and is ok with the risks."
Hookers,2l7gvf,chef_boner,2,Tue Nov 4 23:06:32 2014 UTC,I put my life at stake for an hour of pleasure.   This is overly dramatic.
Hookers,2l7gvf,manslutalt,1 point,Wed Nov 5 19:09:16 2014 UTC,Do you avoid going to sleep at night because you're worried you might never wake up? Do you refuse to get out of bed in the morning because you're worried something could kill you during the day? Everything we do carries a risk. Protected sex is really nothing to worry about.
Hookers,2l7gvf,chef_boner,2,Thu Nov 6 07:25:53 2014 UTC,"I'm kind of in the same boat as you. I'm on month removed from my first encounter. I went to the clinic and I'm awaiting my STD results (HIV turned out negative). After speaking to the HIV counselor I'll have to go back in 6 months to be sure. I felt so guilty after the clinic visit; like there was something wrong with me or that I was a broken man. I lied to the counselor and said I didn't have sex with a prostitute. I was silent for most of my interview after that and she noticed.   She then proceeded to give me a swag bag of condoms. In my head I knew that I would not get any use out of the condoms. I went to a prostitute for a reason, I'm an unattractive loser. I went home, showered and cried.   I haven't deleted my account on my site of choice yet. I really want to talk to my date and ask a million questions; I really want just a one hour Skype chat. I feel if I do this that I'll sound desperate or insane and she'll never answer my questions.   I don't know how you met your provider but I met mine on vacation and I cannot fly back to my vacation spot and talk to her. If you have any advice man I'd like to hear it."
Hookers,2l7gvf,manslutalt,5,Mon Nov 3 23:56:23 2014 UTC,"There's nothing wrong with you. Pretty much every man wants sex, but in today's fucked up society a lot of men can't get it without paying for it and breaking the law in most countries.  Use protection every time, and the risk of catching anything serious will be very low."
Hookers,2l7gvf,chef_boner,1 point,Tue Nov 4 06:14:30 2014 UTC,I still feel bad for what I did. If I was an attractive man and/or had more confidence in myself maybe I wouldn't have to resort to what I did.   I used protection for full service but did not for BBBJ and DATY. I know that those activities are a lower risk than others but there is still a risk. If I did ever get in touch with my partners again and asked them if I was at risk I'd doubt they tell me they weren't clean.

If I was an attractive man and/or had more confidence in myself maybe I wouldn't have to resort to what I did.   Well you're not. Nothing wrong with that, people are different. In today's society with the facebook statuses and the hollywood movies and the ""you are a special snowflake"" mentality, it's easy to have inflated expectations of oneself. In real life, failure is normal and when you face it you pick yourself up and move on. You don't just cry and feel sorry for yourself, you do something about the problem."
Hookers,2l7gvf,chef_boner,1 point,Wed Nov 5 07:29:46 2014 UTC,"Wow I was not expecting that. I was expecting reassurance and maybe some hand-holding.   Is that why you participate in the community? Do you feel like your less attractive/interesting than the next guy?    You don't just cry and feel sorry for yourself, you do something about the problem.   Also what do you recommend I do about that? Confidence come from reassurance and experience. I don't exactly have a support group behind me nor much experience with the ladies.   Sorry if I sound like I'm lashing back; I'm not. I'm just trying to pick your brain."
Hookers,2l7gvf,Nicoleea,2,Thu Nov 6 00:58:04 2014 UTC,"I'm not ugly and there's nothing seriously wrong with me, but I've lacked basic social and flirting skills for most of my life. I'm working to improve those skills but it's a long term project because I have social anxiety. Paying for sex and intimacy helps me overcome my issues and build confidence, and reassures me that if all else fails I still have that to fall back on.  What you need to do is stop beating yourself up. Accept yourself and your decisions. You're in a crisis right now, and that's an opportunity to learn something about yourself and build a new you, even if you have to tear the old one down."

Not trying to scare you but that is the reality in areas where sex work is illegal.  Check out review sites carefully and find something on the up and up.  Consider AMPs, which are incall and sometimes offer full service."

Hookers,2l82d5,jtbrown1,3,Tue Nov 4 03:34:34 2014 UTC,"I'm an escort myself, so I have had customers with similar fears as you. I think the issue is, as an escort, I feel safer conducting business on my own grounds.  Whether it be a hotel I booked or my own apartment. I know the area, I know there are no cameras hidden and it makes me feel safer. So I can understand why they do prefer incall. When you say risky, do you mean legally or for your own safety? Generally the ""Tell a Friend"" rule is the best to go by. If you don't want them to know it's about sex, tell them you were online dating or something. Tell them where you're going (most hotels have restaurants anyway) and if possible, give a name or description of your escort to them.   If you don't want to look creepy, ask the escort to meet you downstairs and take you up. I've done that with quite a few of my clients. Or if it's a hotel that requires the key card to get up, sometimes I tell the front desk that a ""friend"" is coming and to just send them straight up. It might seem embarrassing but honestly, if it makes you feel safer, just do it.   As for the legal side of things, research the laws for it in your area/country. A lot of countries have varying laws between states so look up for the laws pertaining to sex work for where you live. If it's illegal, dig a little deeper. There are generally court cases that will give you a little leeway. For example, in America it's illegal to pay someone for sex but you are allowed to give a lover gifts in the form of money or belongings for sex. Or if you go on a date with an escort and then have sex at the end, you can get around it by arguing that the sex was a personal choice and all the money you gave her was for the date itself.  Just put a little research into it."
Hookers,2l81ck,USAthrowawy,7,Tue Nov 4 02:38:17 2014 UTC,"As long as there isn't obviously something wrong I wouldn't worry about it. Ignorance isn't a sin.

Hookers,2l81ck,manslutalt,2,Tue Nov 4 11:57:04 2014 UTC,"This. To the OP, please keep this in mind. ""The vast majority of sex workers do it of their own free will.""  But it's also true that most don't have any alternatives that could generate a similar income. That doesn't mean they were trafficked, it just means they don't have any mainstream skills and so end up in the underground economy."
Hookers,2l81ck,jtbrown1,1 point,Tue Nov 4 15:20:20 2014 UTC,"Is there any supporting evidence for the statement ""The vast majority of sex workers do it of their own free will"" ?  I guess its true that most don't have any other skills, so is it still unethical to have sex with them?"
Hookers,2l81ck,manslutalt,2,Tue Nov 4 16:19:00 2014 UTC,"I don't think it's unethical. Yes you are taking advantage of someone who's in a vulnerable position, but they see sex work as preferable to the alternatives. If they couldn't make money selling sex, they would be forced to a worse alternative.  And of course you have those who have pretty good options, but still prefer sex work because it pays better, gives them more personal freedom or they just love the work.  edit: As for evidence: No, I can't give you any evidence. I can only speak from my personal experience, what sex workers have told me, what I have read online, and using my own judgment. It just doesn't make sense to me that sex slavery would be the norm rather than the exception. I haven't seen any evidence that sex slavery is nearly as common as some NGOs make it out to be."
Hookers,2l81ck,jtbrown1,0,Tue Nov 4 17:18:06 2014 UTC,Why are you asking questions when you know the answer?  Of course it's unethical. You're taking advantage of someone in a position where they have no options. Is it any worse than buying cheap clothing from Walmart and Nike that were made by poor women in a Bangladeshi sweatshop? You will have to make that determination...

Hookers,2l81ck,TTTT27,4,Fri Nov 7 21:15:28 2014 UTC,"""Sex trafficking"" is a lot of nonsense.  Not saying the no one could ever be coerced, but there is a lot of money available for NGOs that work on the issue and a lot of BS bandied about under the guise of sex work statistics or anti-trafficking information.  For more information start with this blog from former sexworker Maggie McNeill: http://maggiemcneill.wordpress.com/   Or see here http://www.touchingbase.org/resources/sex-industry-facts for facts about the industry in Australia, which decriminalized sex work.   A lot of the problems around sex work arise only in situations where it is illegal, because of the illegality.  Decriminalization is key.  Backpage is the low end of the industry in the U.S., but as your personal experiences have shown, even the low end bears little resemblance to the picture anti-trafficking activists paint."
Hookers,2l81ck,TTTT27,3,Tue Nov 4 03:21:43 2014 UTC,"But I did this in the US, where it is illegal. I am in a small college town, not in a big city, not sure if this makes it less likely or not."

Hookers,2l81ck,gothbull,2,Tue Nov 4 17:24:55 2014 UTC,"It can get tricky. I had my first experience with a provider thru backpage.com. The girl was really very sweet and we got on well. She seemed happy with what she was doing. She left for California and I lost contact w her for a while, but then one of her ""teammates"" called me and desperately asked for my help to get out of town. I gave her a lift and found out that they both had been working for a pimp.  i got a hold of my girl and she admitted it. She quit the business for a while and came out to visit me for a while (no money exchanged. We had become more like FWB). She went back to a new pimp right after our first visit and I had to rescue her a couple of times before she finally quit for good (I hope) and now lives with a boyfriend and works as a stripper.   This girl was making as much as $300,000 a year working for her pimp and left w the clothes on her back. She will be 28 in a few weeks and still has no assets, no savings, no car. Nothing.  That's not trafficing, but it sure as hell is exploitation.   If I had known she was working for a pimp I never would have gone with her.

Barring that, I would say, take a trip to somewhere sex work is legal, and  book a couple of hours at a high-end service after explaining your situation.

So if it's GFE, then it's more then likely you will be kissing a lot, and if it's CBJ, then your going to focus on getting off inside a condom.   If your starting off, I'd recommend maybe look for ads that read ""No Rush GFE experience."" Do an Incall session, do a one hour, or maybe 2.

Some through agencies don't do kissing. But it's just a matter of being upfront and telling them exactly what you're after. If you're in America, if you want a decent time, you're looking at about 200 for 30 minutes. Since you're losing your virginity, splurge a little bit and ask for an hour, maybe even two. If they're only charging $50 they are probably just offering a hand job.   As for STDs, bring your own condoms. Don't do anything ""natural"" or bareback.

You can find stars who have multiple film credits to their name for anywhere from $800 to $5000.  Some of the higher profile UTR stars might even command more than that.   If you check out the reviews on TER, the rates are usually pretty accurate. Any variance would usually be the difference in agency fee. From what I've seen so far, TLC and Pam Peaks take the smallest fees. I'm basing that on the difference between the same stars fee with them and other agencies."

Also there is no standard rate for PS with the same agency. So for example, one PS will charge $1200 but PS working through the same agency will charge $1500.  I had a hard time getting another hobbyist to understand that concept with certain PS agencies.  He assumed that there was a standard rate.  One thing to consider is that some agencies will ask for a deposit from first time clients.  I like TLC.  Pam Peaks is good as well but her website is a disaster.  anyone in the San Francisco Bay Area?  Dillon Harper is coming for a visit Nov. 17-19 through helpubookher"
Hookers,2kuccg,phrameCH,1 point,Mon Nov 3 06:21:06 2014 UTC,"Yeah. Most non-PS agencies I have dealt with have an agency set fee that applies to all the ladies in their stable.   ""Agencies"" like TLC and Pam Peaks are little different though in that they are more booking agents for independent contractors. Taking those two as examples, there's a is a TON of overlap int he talent they have available. In this case, the girls set their rates and the booker adds their fee."

Hookers,2kup02,Kayidan,11,Fri Oct 31 03:40:11 2014 UTC,"If your problem is that you've had some very bad luck, there are often social services available that can help you get back on your feet.  You should definitely be looking into those options.  If you end up trying prostitution, I'd suggest you not let it be known to your prospective clients how desperate you are.

Hookers,2krlrw,waterthrowaway69,9,Thu Oct 30 09:18:25 2014 UTC,"Go to your bank at the earliest convenience. Open one on call account with debit card access, and another savings account with restricted access. Have your pay hit your current account, then that night, set up an ongoing transfer to move you savings out of your cash account, and have it transfer the amount of money you are able to spend on hookers, booze, and whatever other crap you enjoy but find non-essential.  And even if you have no willpower at all, making a debit withdrawal from your household account is a conscious choice you have to make. Every time you do, you will see that additional debit card. And you have done a deal with yourself too. Every last cent in your vice account can be spent with wild abandon. Or you can roll it over each month. Your choice, and there are no limits on what you can spend it on.   Remember, if you can afford to spend $1000 or more on hookers each month it is not an addiction. It simply a sport that a gentleman chooses to enjoy.  But if you can't afford $1000, or you are spending so much time on it that you are ignoring family and friends, then it is problematic, if not an 'addiction'."

Hookers,2krlrw,malibijones,2,Thu Oct 30 14:52:19 2014 UTC,"Brussels was cool.  As I remember they have a red-light district down town just off their train line that runs through the city.  I remember getting a few girls for 70-80 Euros for a half hour.  The girls are in windows and will wave you in as you walk by.  I saw blondes, brunettes from all regions.  A few thick (not fat) but most were average\thin.   The African (black) girls were 2-3 blocks off the main strip (well what I call a strip) with a little less traffic.   I did notice there were ZERO Asian women.  The ""rooms"" took a little getting user to.  The ones I was in were nothing more than curtains (no walls) separating you from the next couples.  Kinda freaked me out since I wasn't use to it.  I think the girls were a little disappointed cause I finished up rather quickly and got out of there... so use to it being ""illegal"" here in the states It was hard to enjoy.    With all that said the prices were reasonable.  After currency conversion you're probably pay just over $100 for full service.  Depending on the girl she will upsell your for everything. Meaning I got good sex, but with only the ""pants off"" for that price.  For an additional $20 euros she would take off her shirt and bra (again depends on the girl).    Still damn good service for less than what we pay for here in major US cities where she is trying to get you back out the door after 4 minutes.  If you the opportunity I say go.   **Edit - I should have mentioned this trip was about 2 years ago so I have no idea what current prices are.  When I went the EURO was VERY strong.  At the time I was able to get 100 Euros for $140 to 150 in USD.  I still think it was a good deal since you're not looking over you shoulder for LE and the girls are somewhat regulated.  I was told the ""mobs"" controlled the girls on the strip and they took their business seriously.  So I never heard of girls ""cheating"" their customers via time or services.   If anyone knows more about this feel free to correct me."

When do you make and eat breakfast and dinner? What about your other chores? You get home at 8 or 9pm and have energy to stay up playing video games and searching for whores? Impressive.  How about restricting yourself to one session per week? And an upper limit on your session cost, let's say $200.  How about massage parlors or massage only providers, instead of full service PIV sex?

Hookers,2kroel,NewProviderSite,5,Thu Oct 30 10:07:16 2014 UTC,"First, make if free to anyone. I'm fond of eccie for this reason. There mostly free; they have some sort of free VIP service that I don't use.   Second, try to find a way to verify clients and providers alike. I'm not on P411 because I'm terrified of having anyone from the community calling me at work; plus the membership service is astronomical. I've heard from providers that in order to me marked as a ""verified provider"" on eccie that you have to know some/be recommended by someone in the business. Idk if that is true or not.   I'd like to see a better search functionality. A basic search search should be on the front page and easy to find. An advance search should allow to search by as much criteria as possible. Make the site as user friendly as possible. TER is too complicated for me. I'm sure if I poked around for a few hours I'm sure I'd get the hang of it but the layout id a turnoff. I keep pulling examples form eccie cuz that what I'm used to. When I wss in contact with a proiver I asked to see her reviews. She said she had 30+ reviews and I felt like an idiot that i couldn't find them. After more searching I finally found them but still felt dumb. Make a good site, that's all I'm asking. Make sure you have a mobile site that is also easy to navigate and doesn't remove the functionality of the  full site.  I'd also like to see one service that encompasses a vast number of providers from all parts of the country (US). I talked with people in the community and I've heard that eccie is primarily used in the south and datecheck in primarily used in the north. This maybe a regional thing but IMO it seems that the east cost has a smaller selection of providers that are less than attractive but have inflated prices. Contrary, the west coast has a vast, diverse, and attractive selection of providers and reasonable prices. This maybe because of a competitive market environment. I'm hoping a more popular site would drive users to consolidate into one site and make it easier to find good providers no matter where you are. Try recruiting members from all the other sites i guess. People obvious left Yahoo to use Google, people left Myspace to go to Facebook. I want the absolute best pokedex of providers.  Also don't plaster if with ads. It makes your site look cheap, unprofessional, and quite frankly a little shady. I'm guessing you're not doing taking this project out of the kindness of your heart, i get that but ads make a site look and feel bad. But if I had to choose between a free site with no VIP membership and a site with ads I'd choose ads. I hate to say it but it's true. I'd rather spend my money on the donations and not the search.  Lastly, allow for some kind of way to prove the healthiness of all users; providers and clients. I'm kind of new to the community and all I think of doing on such short notice was ask. I know not to take anyone's word that they are clean so I've taken it upon myself to get checked. I also recommend everyone else in the community get checked no matter how safe you think you are. Idk if I'd want to post my medical records on a site myself but seeing that a provider is clean up to a certain date would make me feel a little better with booking a meeting with them.  ... Lastly lastly (forgot to mention). Think about hosting. Prostitution is illegal in many countries and I assume hosting a social media site on the subject would be illegal as well. If not it might be a pain in the ass to host in a country that frowns upon the subject. Something to think about.   I hope this helps. let me know what you think of these suggestions and if you need help I am a .NET developer. Keep us up to date on the project."
Hookers,2kroel,chef_boner,1 point,Sat Nov 1 01:50:46 2014 UTC,"Hello Chef_Boner,  Thanks for the good advice, in fact, some of the points you mention is already part of the website requirements, but let me give you some responses to your feedback:   Hosting and Legality Concerns    Very good point! This was one of the first points, that was raised in our initial internal discussions and is and will be a major selling point of the site. We have already narrowed it down to a few countries and fewer hosting services, that would allow us to avoid scrutiny and US government take-down request or legal request.    Geographic usefulness    Our goal is create a unique site, that serves the world, but when accessed you are guided to the area you are currently in, with an easy ability to switch location. Think of it as major business websites, that only show you the language and services specific to your needs and geographical location.    Navigation    Again very important, since if you want any user adoption, you need to have easy navigation, no hidden things or features, that takes many clicks to get to.    Search functionality    Very important. I know that I am very picky with my providers and I know so are my friends and colleagues in this venture, so we know how important it is to be able to search after specific details or services provided. Personally, I tend to stick with blondes with shoulder length hair, small (less than B cup) or fake breasts, preferably under 5'2 (160 cm), they have to be thin with a flat ass and preferably offer anal, and no tattoos. You can imagine that many sites, don't allow me to search for such a narrow field of providers.    Adds    We want to keep the site free for Johns, so our plan is to come up with a model that allows premium profiles for providers or brothels. This means, that our goals is that the adds you see are from providers.     Health check    This is a new point, which we had not considered. Would you mind providing more information about what information you think it relevant or what type of medical records you provide? Would something similar to TTS (Talent Testing Service) be interesting? TTS is medical testing services used in the adult entertainment business in the US. Most studios or producers require you to provide a TTS no less than 14 or 7 days old. TTS basically provides a full blood panel screening. The service is about 3-500 USD, but again it is only available in the US and very few other countries have anything similar to it. Downside is that you need to provide personal details in order to get a test done."
Hookers,2kroel,chef_boner,2,Sun Nov 2 09:58:46 2014 UTC,"Hi NewProviderSite,  I'm glad you got hosting, navigation, and functionality covered for requirements. You're search criteria seems very granular which i what I would like to see. Ease of navigation and functionality can be a personal preference so I'd like to check it out once you have a beta setup.   As for advertisements and premium accounts, it sounds like providers will pay to have premium profiles. If paying for use would deter clients from using the site wouldn't that also deter providers? Do providers pay for membership on other popular sites like P411, eccie, and datecheck? I think not but I'm not sure exactly; again I'm new to the community. I like the fact that client membership would be free but I feel you might be making this site through a male oriented view. It sounds like you're just switching all the expenses from the clients to the providers. If this isn't true can you enlighten me on the functionality of the other sites?   For health and safety, I haven't heard of Talent Testing Service (TTS). Can you give me a brief overview of the criteria? Is TTS available to the public and not just members of the porn industry? What kind of personal info do you need to provide in order to take the test. I went to the clinic last week and it was free. Granted, they only test for a few STDs and HIV. They did ask for my name, address, and other basic info you fill out at any doctor's office. Does TTS test for more diseases? I'd like to see both providers and clients take and provide results of a thorough test. Supplying proof would require posting submitting personal info to your site though. Even if you had a staff to securely screen the paperwork and post a verification on the user's profile, members would be reluctant to submit personal documents. Also I you did test positive for a disease I'd think they'd stop supplying regularly scheduled test results wouldn't you? I still like the idea I just cannot think of a good implementation. If you can make it safe, secure, and get people to use it then I applaud you. Hope to hear back from you.  Regards,  CB  ** EDIT ** Forgot to mention. How will you attract users from the community (clients and providers)? It is not a build it and they will come kind of thing. I'd like to see users from other sites want to use one collective site. I believe this is going to be your biggest hurdle to get around. If you fail to build a successful site then you've wasted a lot of time, money, and resources. If you are partially successful I believe this is worse for the community. All you could provide if your partially successful is further fragment the community. Then all we have is another site to plaster on the sidebar for a region of the world or a small niche user-base. I hope you are truly successful and solidify the community and provide one site to rule them all."
Hookers,2kroel,chef_boner,1 point,Mon Nov 3 00:15:23 2014 UTC,"Thanks again for the feedback. We will certainly keep you in the loop for any testing. As for your questions and comments:   Do providers pay for membership on other popular sites like P411, eccie, and datecheck?    No, providers nor clients would pay for membership. If we did, we would not get any user adoption. Only provider add placements, potentially system verified profiles would cost, and these would be paid for by providers. We had been dabbling with the idea to put two categories of reviews on the profile page, top and bottom five, providers would be able to pay to switch off reviews or hide the bottom five direct feature. However, we feel that this may have a negative effect.   About TTS   So far, we had not considered any type of health check service integration, maybe that will be a future feature. As for TTS, you can use them publicly simply by going to one of their recognized testing sites and your TTS profile is kept private. The information you need to provide is full contact details and address, which is too much for many providers. TTS's service is really targeted for adult models. Their test include all normal STDs and HIV, and you can get the results same day. Ultimately, health checks, as you suggested, may be a good feature, but hard to implement and keep sustaining, especially outside of the US. We discussed it internally and we would rather keep this as a low priority item until we can get more feedback or knowledge on how to potentially implement this.   User adoption   No, it is not like that Kevin Costner movie :) The people on the team are already part of many provider/client communities and some of them are high-ranking individuals. We hope that this way it will spread faster. The other part is our go-to-market strategy, yes, we actually have a marketing plan. There will be quite some advertising but also guerrilla marketing and going directly to the providers to offer demo the service and offer them premium profiles to start using the site. We already did some studies, that show if a site is free to post adds and there is website traffic and sell-through (client actually goes to the provider), then providers are more eager to join the sites.  One part is also primary for the providers to use the site, is that is had to be easy to use. This means easy to manage your profile, change or select tour dates/location, but also manage the gallery. We actually see the gallery as a critical element for the providers, as we need for the site to have the ability to select from your own gallery or upload/take photo directly from a mobile or tablet, and cover areas in the photo easily, so the provider needs any photo editing skills to get it working."
Hookers,2kroel,Hothen,1 point,Mon Nov 3 03:28:19 2014 UTC,"Any thought or concern in a web 2.0 kind of interface? The current sites are kind of cluttered and ugly. It's not high on my want list. Don't let a pretty UI outweigh the need for navigation.   It's kind of a wild idea but I was thinking of the idea of site acquisition. If you were to buy some of the smaller sites you could integrate the user-base, reviews and other data into your site. I have no knowledge of how one company buys another, let alone one that deals in unethical/illegal (society's  view not mine) activities. If you do acquire other sites you help to defragment the community and hopefully bring more business to areas that have little or none. I'm hoping after all your time and effort my area would see more attractive and younger providers at a competitive and low price. That's just me dreaming though.   How far are you in the development phase? Do you have anything to show or are you still gathering requirements? Keep me in the loop."

""No more than 2 students at a time in the store after school hours"".

So it could be an independent provider saying ""no black men"" because she gets endless phone calls/texts from pimps trying to recruit her.  Or it could be a pimp telling the girl to say ""no black men"" because he's afraid of losing his girl to another pimp.  Every now and then, providers would post a transcript of text messages or voice mails she'd get from pimps trying to recruit her.  You can imagine how they went.  Usually didn't have anything to do with bad attitudes or treating white women poorly.

In fact, I have come to prefer a local agency. The girls tends to more GND because they've usually just responded to a craigslist ad and are in need of some quick cash. Well-reviewed ""professional"" providers definitely have more mileage and are a bit more jaded.

Hookers,2jv7o3,Oshouiji,2,Tue Oct 21 06:42:58 2014 UTC,This is actually a very important thing to ask and to know about. I think it is very important if you are going to be going back and becoming a regular with the girl you see. For me most of the time I don't go back a second time but there has been the occassional girl or two that I will go back and see. I usually always try to get the situation that you are in comfortable. If you are funny then tell lots of jokes. As you know all women love to laugh and when they are laughing things change and they will remember you. If you are not funny then do something funny. My go to is to blow up a condom that I bring and make dick jokes of other clients then let it fly across the room like a balloon after making a cum joke. They get loosened up and then the sex and everything else is better. The goal is to make it more fun for you and that means making them comfortable. Treat them like normal people and treat them like you just picked them up and you want to keep them for yourself. Really there is no difference between them and us other than their job.
Hookers,2jv7o3,analfuck,2,Tue Oct 21 14:09:29 2014 UTC,Well said. I've never really been the type to tell jokes when I talk to women though I can see how that could help lighten the mood. In the town I'm in there are only two AMPs (the best city happens to be our capital with roughly 27) so I'm going to try both and will more than likely end up a regular customer if things go smoothly.
Hookers,2jv7o3,cp9406,1 point,Tue Oct 21 21:23:54 2014 UTC,"I don't visit AMPs, but I think my ""trick"" for getting a provider to remember me would work there too.

It's worked every time."

Hookers,2jo9w2,MongerD,2,Tue Oct 21 06:18:21 2014 UTC,"Lot's of ignorant speculation here, /u/gothbull has a partial answer, this is true, often enough. Basically, there are a couple of tiers of Asian Providers. Let's stick to the AAMPs for this discussion. Bottom tier are those providing for the US Asian community, mostly Chinese, advertised in Chinese newspapers, these ladies usually rotate between places fairly frequently and are not advertised online that I know of, minimal service (what most Chinese men expect), price is @ $100 +-.         Next tier up is the 10 day house, from whom most of the fake picture ads are seen. Some of the ladies servicing the Asian houses can be found here as well. Services are all over the map, mostly 1 shot and go. $120-140/hr., more if they can get away with it locally.        Next tier up are mostly the veterans of the 10 day houses and become semi independent, usually older, services are better and more complete, pix are usually more accurate, prices $140-160/hr.         Highest tier is @ 200+/hr, pix are almost always of the lady, though may be heavily photoshopped. Locally, most of these are from Korea, with very good plastic surgery.      In the lower tiers, the pix are seldom representative, unless you believe having two breasts and bipedal as being ""representative""."

But saving face is VERY important in Asian culture.  Shame is to suicide/murder, and their culture is not as forgiving as progressive western societies, especially in relation to this industry.  Sex work is not tolerated.  Mundane occupations, and even acting and modeling is looked down on... They are supposed to be doctors and engineers, right?"

If it's social pressure to lose it, fight that off.   2)  It's also ok not to be.  If you want to, go for it.  It's worth spending some time really thinking about if you want it to be Miss Right or Miss Right Now, and if the latter, if you want someone who wants you for you or for your money.  There's no universally right answer here, only what's right for you.  3)  Your body, your rules, her body, her rules.  Just because some of these rules involve money transfer, does not change this.  If you think she's cheated you, go home and leave a negative review on some review sites.  Escorts still typically have some boundaries, respect them.  4)  Respect can go a long way. I've had an already discounted half hour session go to an hour because I was an actual nice guy.    5)  I'd suggest at least a half hour session, probably worth a full hour.  You might need some extra time to get over your nerves, and possibly time to go again if you finish up early the first time.    6)  Don't even consider bareback, except maybe for a BJ(if she requires a covered BJ- her body, her rules.  take it or go without.  I'd suggest taking it).  Most escorts will have condoms, but just in case, bring a couple yourself.  7)  Be careful about trusting anyone.  Bring only what you need.  There are some bad people involved in this industry.  Some great ones, too, but it can be hard to tell the difference.  Also, remember they provide an entertainment service, not a relationship.  You might get on well with a waitress, for instance, but at the end of the day the relationship is you hand her money and she brings you food."

Stay at the Pacific Breeze hotel for $50/night (and ask for them to have a drive to come get you.) 10 minute drive. Check in.

I was in your boat a year ago, and would say that nothing will beat actually calling the call girl. I knew how much she charged from her internet ad, and went with the one that seemed most attractive in her pictures, since having met a different prostitute as a motel desk clerk, and then comparing her real-life form to her pictures, it seems there's always a bit of degredation, unless you're maybe talking about a whore that's greater than $400 per hour.   Anyways, we had a pretty good time in that she thought it was funny, surreal, and sweet to be a first timer. Just pretend your trying to set up a meeting with someone, don't mention her vocation except maybe in abstract vague terms when on the phone. And after paying money ask questions on whether you can kiss her, where, etc. and that's about it, I guess. Something I regretted is that she gave me a blowjob with a condom on, and I could've planned ahead and had more money in my pocket and would've maybe tried to ask for no condom, anticipating she'd probably ask for a bit more money, so plan for that maybe?  ALSO, and this is IMPORTANT, especially since it's your first time and you might be nervous, and foreplay may not be a real option, make sure you get a blowjob first to get real hard, so you don't potentially blow the night by staying soft.   I made the mistake of trying to go down on her first, just to see a real life pussy up close, but lets just say, there's a reason that might be called crazy and counterproductive: the smell might not be good.   Regular civilian women do not smell as bad, or maybe just really go all out on the price of your girl.  I  ALSO SECOND THE BORDELLO OPTION"

Hookers,2jbipc,unhealthyadvice,13,Wed Oct 15 14:26:23 2014 UTC,"There's lots of discussion about this on client forums.  The main reason it boils down to is because these men feel it makes the session much better and that the risks are overblown.  I'll explain in more detail to answer your question, but please note that I am not advocating this viewpoint, nor am I defending it.  That sex without a condom is more physically pleasurable for a man is probably obvious.  However, much of the appeal is also psychological.  For some men, putting on a condom disrupts the fantasy that the provider wants and enjoys being with him (yes, these men are well aware the provider is only in it for the money, but like all good fantasies, the more they can immerse themselves in it, the more they enjoy it).  They also feel that it lessens the intimacy and spontaneity of the session.  And some of them prefer bareback sex precisely because it is taboo and, in their minds, only a little dangerous.  This last reason gets at why these men are willing to take a risk.  On the forums, these men will cite all kinds of statistics about the low infection rate (percent of the population who are hiv+) and the low transmission rate (likelihood of transmitting the virus).  In their minds, the level of risk of bareback sex with an escort is similar to that of the risk you take while sky diving, racing cars or riding bulls.  They admit there is some risk, but they feel it is low enough that it is acceptable.  Again, I'm not trying to excuse it or defend it in any way; I'm just explaining it from the client perspective based on what I read in the forums."

Hookers,2jbipc,evafha,1 point,Thu Oct 16 01:24:28 2014 UTC,"Again, how about just moving back  to where you belong in r/sexworkers and staying out of r/hookers, since you and other providers have made it clear you want r/sexworkers for yourselves. Let us John's have r/hookers without the interference or modding from a provider."
Hookers,2jbipc,analfuck,-4,Thu Oct 16 05:37:59 2014 UTC,"nothing wrong about speaking the truth? Oh you have much to learn..   on the contrary, being honest and open helps more than it does giftwrapping everything.   it ignores the topic completely and goes from 0 to sexual objectification in 0.1 seconds    This is r/hookers, part of this subreddit is all about sexual objectification, in fact so is the predominance of the entire prostitution business.    it completely ignores social rules and normal boundaries    What's wrong with checking someone profile. Trust me if you are hiring someone you Google them and check their online presence.    you come off as a socially awkward virgin who's desperate for sex    Not desperate for sex, just have a very specific fetish. Other than that, and outside of the bedroom with either hookers, my partner or our other sexual partners, I am fairly regular person. I go to work at the office,  do my job well, earn money, invest money to grow my networth and then I am probably no different that the person sitting in any office, but having a special kink at home. Fuck me, I even know of two-three dude in my office that wears lingerie under their suits, talk about ignoring social rules and normal boundaries.    people don't like being stalked, and even though it happens all the time, people especially don't like being reminded of it    Then don't post stuff online, especially of yourself naked and especially on r/gonewild. The mass amounts of humans that take part in that subreddit constantly check posts from the people who submit there.    even though I don't interpret it as racist, people are hyper-sensitive about any hint of racism so implying that black girls generally aren't hot is tactless    In Europe it's completely okay to call someone black. We are not going to walk around and call them African-European's or a person of Subsaharan Descent. Let's me quote what I said ""I think you are one of the few black girls I find hot."" and you know, it's simple I don't find many black woman sexually attractive, some yes, but not many. Most likely you have the same about certain females or males yourself."
Hookers,2jbipc,word-dumpster,-3,Wed Oct 15 20:39:07 2014 UTC,"Yeah, and who gives a fuck. If you're not going to sexually objectify a whore, then you're the one who needs their head checked.

Hookers,2j6iu5,Idiotescourt,12,Tue Oct 14 02:55:33 2014 UTC,"You basically have some options, I can give you the steps on how to get it done.  It is very simple, first you need to find the owner or technical contact for the site, then you need to send the DMCA take down notice to them directly. Here are the steps:   Make a list of all the adds you found online and the domain names, like escortadds.com etc etc. Take all the domain names and go to http://whois.domaintools.com/ and fill it in. Look in the details for the technical contact or owner, write down those email addresses. Get yourself a prepaid phone, so the owners or technical contacts can get in touch with you without you using your personal mobile phone. Create a new email address on Gmail, so it doesn't tie back to your personal email address. For each of the domains, send the below email to them, then wait to they respond. Give them three days, then forward the email again and add the line, that you request them to respond within 5 business days. If they don't respond within five business days, you forward it again and you add, Please comply within 5 business days or you will need to take legal proceedings. If you don't get a response, check how you can take them to a small claims court in your state. It it really painless process, and there are no public records. The other option is to get a lawyer to draft you a letter and send it to them to remove the content.   Subject: DMCA TAKE DOWN NOTICE  My name is INSERT NAME.

Hookers,2j5kgc,autopornbot,0,Mon Oct 13 21:44:44 2014 UTC,"Yeah, if you do that you'll possibly blow a load 0.5 seconds into it.   You should check out /r/nofap. Too much porn and fapping really can fuck up your ability to have normal sex. It's not a moral thing at all, it's just that if you stop fapping, you turn into an unstoppable sex beast.   But you can also just porn/fap less often, and get a partial benefit. Everything in moderation, including moderation.   But I also had that problem once, and I don't think it had anything to do with fapping, really. I got a lapdance in Mexico from an unbelievably hot 18 year old stripper and was just so intimidated by her looks that I couldn't get hard at all. It's funny because we went to another strip club later, and a much less hot, thicker girl was dancing for me and my dick worked fine. It just happens sometimes. Try not to worry about it - worrying doesn't help.   Try to stop putting any pressure on yourself. Be upfront about it. If you can, get with a girl and just tell her right away - and see if she can help. Like ""lets work on this thing together. Help me be able to cum."" That way, you don't feel the pressure to ""perform"" with her, you've already told her it doesn't happen. So then you can just kind of relax and enjoy it.   And in the meantime, it just means you last longer. That's not the absolute worst thing in the world!"
Hookers,2j5kgc,jennyroll,3,Tue Oct 14 20:03:42 2014 UTC,jerking off with porn too often can be the problem. lay off for a month or two and then try coming with people and you'll see an improvement :)
Hookers,2j5kgc,Bizvida,3,Mon Oct 13 23:36:42 2014 UTC,"The feeling of a vagina is more subtle than your hand... also the motion (body still hand moving) is different than during sex. When this happens men tend to jerks off to ""make sure it still works"" and that just makes it worse. Just stop masturbating as often and then a week or two before an encounter give it a break."
Hookers,2j5kgc,gothbull,4,Mon Oct 13 23:55:37 2014 UTC,"It's cause you jack-off too much. No joke.

Just enjoy the moment and you'll be fine."
Hookers,2j5kgc,xoprovider,1 point,Tue Oct 14 01:49:17 2014 UTC,"hmmmm, I'm kinda in the same boat as you. I actually lie to a lot of girls and say I came inside the condom, throw it out before they see it. Yes, some providers look disappointed I'm as hard as a rock, one girl asked for me to cum on her tits and actually that did help and she was happy and smiling like she won a lotto.   It is a bit about anxiety and also pressure time pressure to be exact. But don't take it too hard, you may need to learn how to cum on command, or at least learn to just go with it. I won't lie the first time cuming on a provider's tits I was happy along with her, she later kissed me and said to me ""your a true gentleman."" My advice..... close your eyes, and enjoy the feeling along the tip of your cock, maybe imagine another girl or just squeeze the provider's tits to help.  I've been personally keeping a collection of mental images of Japanese big boobies, helps me cum on command."

In our line of work, that prerogative is very important to maintaining respect for ourselves. As an escort I do not kiss my clients because I feel it is too intimate, they don't always agree or like it, but it's tough shit for them. At a strip club there isn't a menu for you to pick from. You pick a girl that you like and she does what she wants, if it happens to match up with what you are looking for, then lucky you! If it doesn't however; respect her comfort zone, pay for your dance and move on."

Consider it a side of life you're just now realising is there.  Is it the porn? Maybe. Try staying off for a week before your next visit. I personally consider porn both a boon to my hormone addled poor impulse control and a drawback in being with providers. But even when I've gone without for a week or several weeks and have 100mg of magic pill inside me, it still doesn't work. Foreplay is magic, really.  I've fapped 4 times a day for weeks and could still get it up on whatever occasion, but that was with great chemistry and a few days off. Other times I've been off porn/fapping for over a month, and even with a pill it was a complete no go. Or at the fifth provider for the day I was completely up for it both mentally and medicinally, but then I had severe secondary effects from the overdose of pills I had in me. And then, again, there was good chemistry between me and her. Never underestimate getting along with the girl ;)  Health issues? Yeah, could be. Do you exercise? Stamina is key in everything, not just this.  All in all it's something you can't gauge off of one visit/session, and something you'll get to know about yourself in the long term generally.  First time? Good on you. Now go have another time, see how that goes :)"

In which case shrug, smile, say 'eh okay' and better luck next time. Be nice to them and to yourself :)  I tend to not get very hard until it's go time unless there's a loooot of touchy feely. Depending on the masseuse the amount of groping varies, and can get more up close if they recognise you've been there before.  Even if you say what you want or move her hand to the package and she says 'we don't do that here', you're still good.

Hookers,2iyrlh,llcoolrobb,1 point,Sat Oct 18 07:08:30 2014 UTC,"Well from my experience working in parlors, clients who don't want anything extra are like customers who eat at your resturaunt and don't tip. If the massage cost you about $40-80, she probably made $10-20, and the house gets the rest. Her money comes from what else you pay her for. If you left without giving her any extra, she will remember you, and probably ranted to her coworkers about you as well.   If you want to go back, I would make sure that you get something more than the massage and tip well. If you make the same mistake again, you will be ""one of those cheap clients"" who everyone hates and no one wants to take.   You do not want to be that guy."

Hookers,2iyac4,gothbull,2,Sun Oct 12 01:24:48 2014 UTC,on personal experience. I actually called the provider about my credit cards and she responded not knowing anything. It turned out it was the motel doing an extra 90 bucks on my account. At least I was able to check on the girl and learning she wanted to make sure I was okay and having a good time and maybe coming back for more.
Hookers,2iyac4,phrameCH,-1,Sun Oct 12 04:08:04 2014 UTC,"Call the cops and report your wallet stolen Block all the cards Call her back and what she was doing   However, she was most like just going through your wallet to check your name and take some extract cash. I've had girls do that before, but always caught them. Total bonus when you catch them, since they become much more willing to give you extra services or more  than they usually offer."
Hookers,2iyac4,unhealthyadvice,2,Sat Oct 11 18:16:22 2014 UTC,Damn cancelling cards sucks. I'll just keep a close eye on them next few statements. Also why would she want to check my name?

All virgins have a fanciful version of what sex is supposed to be like in their head, and EVERYONE is going to fail to meet those expectations their first time. Plus youre still ahead of half your peers who still have to imagine what sex is like."
Hookers,2iwef7,Emersontm,5,Fri Oct 10 23:51:53 2014 UTC,"The first time can definitely be very underwhelming because the expectations are just impossible to meet.  And sex is one of those things where thinking about it while you're doing it will decrease your ability to enjoy it.  When you're nervous and self-conscious, that almost makes it impossible not to think about it.  Both the nervousness and self-consciousness should go away as you become more experienced.  A thinner condom can help with sensation.  Also you can try placing a little drop of lube on the inside tip of the condom before you roll it on.  I've found that to help quite a bit as well.  Finally, next time, you should experiment with different positions.  Many guys find they enjoy some positions much more than others."
Hookers,2iwef7,unhealthyadvice,5,Sat Oct 11 07:25:35 2014 UTC,"you are an inspiration. you went and did something instead of just talking about it. i was fucking 22 before i ever got laid (by a non pro) i was also kind of like ""so that's what all the fuss is about?"" toward the sex, but i was happy because i, like you, was no longer a virgin. i wish there was something you could do about your small dick, but maybe they will invent a pill or operation some day to help. fortunately i got pretty lucky in the dick department, just wish there was more females willing to let me stick it in them."

We all don't have the best time, in fact it sounded she was more then okay with it. Like one time I got called a ""faggot"" for not getting it hard on command.  Look at it this way, we all make mistakes in order to improve on the next time. So don't feel so insecure about this one. And dude, don't worry about dick size, a woman can get off with only 2 fingers pressed up against her clit that's all it takes. And it's normal to have difficulty getting it inside, trust me.  Take what you have done as a learning experience."

Hookers,2iuzm3,add_blonde,3,Fri Oct 10 18:52:15 2014 UTC,"The percentage doesn't make it legitimate.  a) The rate is too low. Dramatically lower rates than the average are designed to make you lose your mind at the thought of cheap sex. At which point you will be ripped off, or scammed, or robbed.  b) $25 ain't shit in this game. Nobody is going to keep an appointment over a $25 deposit.  Stay safe."
Hookers,2iuzm3,malibijones,3,Fri Oct 10 19:50:12 2014 UTC,That's really low! You'd spend more than that to date a girl from the office - so I'm skeptical. Don't be cheap; aim higher and get the real deal.

Hookers,2iuzm3,llcoolrobb,1 point,Fri Oct 10 23:22:48 2014 UTC,"it is extremely unusual for a lower end lady to require a deposit. especially in the 100.00 range. I have heard of ladies who charge upwards of 300.00 per hour requiring a deposit and they are legit. They do this because as someone else said there are tons of no shows, flakes, and time wasters. backpage and city vibe are both full of providers some are lower end and some are higher end. Both sites have ladies there using fake pictures and scamming people. You have to be really careful. Your best bet is to check and see if a lady has reviews. If she doesn't it doesn't necessarily mean she is a scammer or using fake pictures but the risk of being taken advantage of is higher. good luck and stay safe."
Hookers,2ivjvk,Sactownhobbyist,5,Fri Oct 10 18:06:09 2014 UTC,"It kind of depends.   If you're responding to an add in Backpages it's pretty common.

From my experience about 60% will return a call at ""some point"",  typically in 30 minutes to an 4 hours later.     Contrary to the amount of adds out there.. not all of them are ""professionals"" and can be flakey.   I suggest you keep a list of 5 to 10 on standby.

I have never tried brothels or soaplands there. If you walk around the worse parts of town, you will be approached, but at the time there were rumours of clip-joint like activities shaming tourists out of big money, so I was a bit nervous about trying. In retrospect, I would trust field reports over third hand expat tales.  I have had more luck with actual Japanese girls in Australasia. Korean girls have become a 'thing' so the odds of booking a genuine Japanese girl have increased dramatically."

Hookers,2iiwod,Chikkabow,1 point,Tue Oct 7 15:35:55 2014 UTC,Why?
Hookers,2iiwod,CostaDelicata,3,Wed Oct 8 06:19:40 2014 UTC,"Why? Why is education ... ?  or why to read the hundreds of other similar posts and Learn from the answers people already gave?  Let me put it this way.  Ignorance is extremely expensive.  Every day this sub is flooded with this nonsense : Is this legit? Are her photos real? The person that asks this kind of question was savvy enough to get on reddit, and find the sub.  I bet you that same person knows this handy site : google.com  oh wait, why did I say nonsense out of ThRoWaWaY12386's mouth?  because TV/TS people have no special risk.  They are just PEOPLE like everybody else.   The risk in contacting or being available to anybody lies not in their orientation, but in their Behavior!"
Hookers,2iiwod,Chikkabow,3,Tue Oct 7 16:05:45 2014 UTC,Agreed. That was the point I was making. :-)
Hookers,2igskz,sdflsd,1 point,Mon Oct 6 17:36:16 2014 UTC,Thanks! :)
Hookers,2igskz,js11235,2,Tue Oct 7 04:22:53 2014 UTC,Not having any more info... 2500 is pretty average. Typical range of the providers I see is about 2000 to 3500 ... Not that I can consistently shell that out.
Hookers,2igskz,collegeguy1492,-1,Tue Oct 7 07:03:38 2014 UTC,"Nope, not high. Even if it was, too bad for you. Don't argue with SWs over their rates. Ever."
Hookers,2igskz,analfuck,6,Mon Oct 6 22:31:41 2014 UTC,I would agree with you in a standard case where the rate for the time is already decided. This person hasn't done an overnight and she is asking me if that is a good rate.   I do not negotiate if I'm visiting anyone.
Hookers,2ifj8r,smittyjergensen,3,Mon Oct 6 08:24:07 2014 UTC,"Providers will have safe sex supplies.  You can bring your own if you have a special brand you like, but there is a chance the provider will not use your supplies out of fear of tampering.  A good provider keeps a variety of sizes, and non latex options.  If they dont have any safe sex supplies on hand, i recommend getting the hell outta there"
Hookers,2ifj8r,CallAnna,1 point,Mon Oct 6 21:17:30 2014 UTC,"i recommend getting the hell outta there   Yeah. The ""getting the hell outta there"" maneuver is in order if she doesn't have her own supplies. Imagine how many time she hasn't had her own supplies and think about what that might have led to."
Hookers,2ifj8r,cp9406,2,Tue Oct 7 03:16:46 2014 UTC,"Most providers will have them and good ones will have a selection; but you should still always bring your own.  This way you can pick a brand that you like.  Show it to her early when you get there so she can inspect it if you wants to.  She may still insist on using one of hers.  Sometimes a provider will have strong preferences for a certain brand, especially if they're giving cbj.  Apparently, some condoms can taste awful."
Hookers,2ifj8r,unhealthyadvice,2,Mon Oct 6 09:09:54 2014 UTC,"There are some providers that won't use any you bring with you for fear they've been tampered with.   If you bring your own, make sure you have an unopened box of them."
Hookers,2ifj8r,cp9406,1 point,Mon Oct 6 12:42:26 2014 UTC,Good point.  Many providers have their own brand they prefer to use.. especially if they are providing Oral services.
Hookers,2ifj8r,malibijones,2,Mon Oct 6 14:14:34 2014 UTC,"I sometimes take a condom with me and after a very brief amount of small talk I will blow it up and make some joking humping motions and then pretend to cum and let it fly around like a baloon. It often gets a quick laugh out of them. It is a great ice breaker and once you get a woman to laugh the rest of the night is more exciting. I have done this several times and they always seem to like the extra lightheartedness of someone that just takes a moment to be different and not the normal jerks they usually see. Sex is better when they are happy and in the mood. and this and some other little joking forms of flattery will make for a better night every time. Joking aside, bring a condom for just in case but if they don't have condoms it would be strange. I have even had a girl tell me to stop by and get condoms before I came and she told me she would pay me back, and she did with a little extra love and attention. Peace."

Hookers,2ifj8r,Draydpp925,1 point,Sat Oct 11 05:07:58 2014 UTC,bring your own just in case. some unprofessional girls say they don't have them etc to try to not give you full service.
Hookers,2ifj8r,paulkersey1999,1 point,Tue Oct 7 23:41:29 2014 UTC,"I always bring my own as a provider but, I do ask my client if they prefer to use there own. I am cautious when it comes to the possibility of tampering, so I always hold their condom up to the light to check for needle holes and such."
Hookers,2ibuz3,hookedz,1 point,Sun Oct 5 03:02:58 2014 UTC,I have heard of requests like this before.  It could go either way.  I have been asked or pics before but I don't comply.
Hookers,2ibuz3,malibijones,1 point,Sun Oct 5 04:05:41 2014 UTC,I always wounded why they ask for a pic
Hookers,2ibuz3,muchape,1 point,Sun Oct 5 09:16:02 2014 UTC,If you do it make sure to remove any identifying information the picture contains (http://www.verexif.com/en/ or similar tools) If she's legit sending pics back and forth don't mean anything in terms of verification. Some people feel more comfortable when they get pics from clients but they can so easily send fake pics it's not worth anything. I wouldn't do it. I've done verification with several providers and verification services and photos are never required. Encouraged maybe in some cases but never required.

Hookers,2iacfw,shythrowawaycurious,1 point,Sat Oct 4 16:51:31 2014 UTC,"Provider here... If you are paranoid you are more than likely going to make the girl paranoid too..  Just mention its your first time, contact someone with reviews, and be respectful when making contact and you should be fine."
Hookers,2iacfw,gypsy-hook,1 point,Fri Oct 10 10:59:01 2014 UTC,"Where are you? In the US? If so, which part? The advice you need is from someone who knows your area. That's why it's so difficult to have an actual newbie guide. I'm in Tennessee, so good advice for here would not necessarily apply in New York or California.   What you should do is find the review sites that prominent in your area. I use in equal parts TER, icky and USASG for information on providers. These are all national sites. There's not really a good regional site in your area. You just need to find it.  I also recommend P411, especially for newbies. Take a look at the publicly shown providers in your area to see if any are ""Newbie Friendly"". That should give you an idea if it's worth it to sign up. Their verification can be intrusive, but they are discreet. They are also based in Canada, not the US.   Now for what you need to look for in a provider, there is one universal piece of advice. You'll want one that is highly reviewed by clients that have many reviews. That shows that they are legit.  Also keep in mind that you may need to see someone to start out that not exactly on the top of your list. You'll need them references.    Hope this helps. Stay safe."
Hookers,2iacfw,cp9406,1 point,Sat Oct 4 17:02:50 2014 UTC,"I probably am just too paranoid to do this lol.. for example I don't even want to say where I am from, even though millions live in this city.  Too many questions like how do you go about contacting them, should I use a throwaway pre-paid phone.. do you go to them they come to you etc?  Like they have a place they bring clients to?  How to ensure that it's not a psycho setting me up for a robbery/murder, or that it's not a cop setting me up for a sting.  How to maintain my privacy ie will I have to reveal my real identity?  Yeah I have sooo many questions along these lines lol.  As you can see I'm kinda paranoid and probably over-think stuff"
Hookers,2iacfw,burner47,1 point,Sat Oct 4 17:20:08 2014 UTC,"Ouch that sounds like a HUGE no-go to me, then.. revealing my real name and employer.. since I'm military and it's prohibited to take part in those.. activities, it's especially more sensitive than other professions.  The privacy thing is HUGE for me so it sounds like this thing is not going to happen ever, unless I put huge effort into concocting a 100% fake identification, which sounds like more trouble than its worth and even more legal risk than it already is.. thanks for the info though it is really offputting.  I wonder, why the heck do they want our real info?"
Hookers,2i97fy,Draydpp925,1 point,Sat Oct 4 05:21:36 2014 UTC,I get that before every session. But it goes away once I am with the girl. I could just be a case of the little head taking over for the big head.   Maybe it's just time for you to take a break and reassess after a month or so?

Hookers,2i6i1v,MasonJarTeaDrinker,2,Thu Oct 23 12:58:32 2014 UTC,"well, simply set up a simple excuse to why you wish to stop. It could be simple, it could be ""I am simply spending too much money"" or ""I don't want to get aids."" And just devote that in your mind. And just build on it, keep tracking how long it's been for yourself and tell yourself what your doing this for. To be honest, walking a friend's dog helps controls any of these urges. Knowing that a living creature cares for you and your taking care of them helps more then any support group."

Sorry.  All these photos are from here escort add, but also from my Google Image Searching her and finding all her model photos.  However, she did offer to shot model photos for 300 for 30 minutes, but no sex in the photos (bummer)... Next time, I will plan it for better.  Honestly, I just got freaked out be her fine tits and flat ass, and her being overly nice and wanting to be fucked, that I lost focus and didn't get the Mobius and 808 recording right. So much for thinking with my dick instead of my mind...  Still the best bareback bj and deepthroat I had in years"
Hookers,2hbs4s,phrameCH,4,Wed Sep 24 13:16:08 2014 UTC,When I was there I found a red light district that worked like a bar hookup. You went into the bar and paid the 'guy in charge' and he brought you out a few girls to choose from. He gave you a choice and you got to chit chat about 10 minutes. Then she led you down a hall to her room. The room had all the things that an AMP would have in the actual room. I got a stand up shower and was put into a hot towel wrap then a little massage and then full service. I tipped her in USD and rolled. It was a little hard to find but once I did it was very open and good.

Hookers,2hbs4s,gothbull,1 point,Thu Sep 25 05:42:11 2014 UTC,"well, there's a whole culture of more voluptuous japanese women recently in the past 14 years.   http://asiaunwrapped.tumblr.com/  I did get to hook up with one recently had an amazing ass, not even the jokes you hear about asian women a flat asses. No this was boom, just an ass that just hung out there with some perkiness to it. Large breast for a C cup there are more Japanese women with larger like G cups. She had a bit of pubic hair above her lips, longer strands not curly, but it was fun having that tickly my upper lip. The sex was actually the best, it wasn't like the videos where she's too submissive and kind of hints to ""rape or molestation"" like the videos were, she was very confident and enjoyed it a lot. Maybe a bit too Americanize this girl, but I do think the recent Japanese pornos are a bit misleading at least keeping the myth of what they think the audience likes.  I grew up in a predominate Asian neighborhood as a young adult, if I had to recommend as type I'd always say Koreans over all. But Japanese girls are wonderful to be honest, very special from all of them."

The girl I did moan but she would really loved to say ""fuck me with your big american dick."""
Hookers,2h7t9n,johnndeee,4,Tue Sep 23 10:21:46 2014 UTC,"Let's be clear, there are ""Jack Shacks"" and ""AMP"", both of which are usually run by Asians.  Door Fee is usually $40 for a half hour, and $60 for a full hour.  A ""Jackshack"" is mostly legitimate massage with some sensual inner thighs, ass teasing, and handjob thrown in.  The girls will be wearing scrubs or casual attire for the most part.  At these places on your first visit, you lay down, drape, then get a legitimate massage until such time as you feel the teasing caress of fingernails on your inner thighs and/or ass.  If you respond favorably, you'll probably be offered a hand job - note the probably and be a gentleman about it if it doesn't happen.  Tips are $40 for a handjob, $80 for a blow job if offered which is a rare occurrence, and $100 for full service.  I've found that the Chinese usually only offer ""L1"".  An ""AMP"" is a brothel with a massage table instead of a bed. The girls will be in bikini's or lingerie.  Walk in, pay the same house fee and the tip up front which is $120 for a half hour or $140 for a full hour.  The girl may then give you a quick make-out session as Vice LEO's usually doesn't kiss, or ask you to strip then take you by the hand to get a table shower.  If you're lucky, it'll be a body-to-body shower.  Afterwards, you'll go back lay down for some caressing followed by oral and full service fun...  The main thing you never do is ask for specific services prior to the provider touching your cock.  Once a provider has started playing with your junk, then you can verbalize reasonable requests.  The other thing is to be well groomed and have impeccable hygiene; even if you're getting a table shower clean breath and zero funk is appreciated by the providers."

I'm a bit surprised to see you describe aamps as ""professional/clinical"".  Were you seeing $200 korean girls on the peninsula or in the south bay?  I can see where the language barrier and their tendency to rely on a ""script"" for their services can lead to a session that seems clinical to some people; but I've found that if you make even a little effort at communication, they will usually relax quite a bit and allow you to go off script.  I don't speak a lick of Korean, but my sessions with them, especially on repeat visits, usually involve lots of flirtation, fooling around, and very gfe service."

TER is good because escorts advertise there and it also has reviews.  two other sites that you may want to check out are eccie.net and adultfax.  Both are review sites as well.  Backpage is worth a look but is overrun with AMPs/AAMPs.  Plenty of independent ladies in SOMA/FiDi.  But it all depends on what ""type"" you are looking for.  Lots of escorts who are touring stay in the hotels around union square area also."

If any necessary information is omitted, she won't reply.  Just make sure she has all the info she needs.  Initial contact should not include any questions that already can be readily answered from her ad/website (such as rates or location or availability).  Remember these girls are not secretaries and don't have all day to reply to any interrogating requests (sometimes too may questions create ""red flags"" and can just add to the already stressful job and paranoia that they already have).  They want to put all the effort into the session itself, so don't make things more complex than it should be.  TL;DR:  Keep it simple.  Name, contact number, day/time of session.   No special requests or stupid questions, at least in the initial contact. Once you're labeled a ""time waster,"" she'll ignore you no matter what."

If it it was for Asian women, I suggest trying: www.aampmaps.com  For American (non-Asian), not sure where to go to find accurate reviews.You probably have to go regional. Alot of them are by invitation only, so you have to get verified through a third party site like preferred411 or datecheck. Not sure how comfortable I would be giving out my name, occupation, and even credit card info to some third party located outside the US. I will stick to Asian Massage Parlors."
Hookers,2gtsc7,amsterdamjigga,2,Fri Sep 19 10:09:35 2014 UTC,It could happen (TER is not above scandal for sure) but my experience as an escort was that my clients often had reviews rejected repeatedly and gave up in frustration. There is some back channel non sense always going on there.
Hookers,2gtsc7,hobaloo,1 point,Fri Sep 19 05:16:23 2014 UTC,"Fake reviews are part of the game unfortunately.  I wouldn't necessarily say that it is TER is doing it but possibly the ""managers"" of the girls.  Are you a VIP member of TER?  If not, I recommend becoming one.  Once you've done that, you can check to see who else the reviewer has reviewed.  If the reviewer has seen other ladies, chances are he's legit.  If he's only seen one lady, it is possible he's just a management shill.  You can also send an inbox to that reviewer as well if you have further questions.  Also, it would be good to choose an escort that has a lot of reviews.  Chances are that an escort with a lot of reviews won't be fake or LE.  As for ""a lot of reviews"", generally an escort who's been around for awhile and has multiple reviews.  The TER review will also include a link to the escort's website or site where she advertises.  I'd generally stay away from any backpage escorts unless she also advertises somewhere else and has lots of reviews.    As for the TER moderators, yeah they can be hit or miss.  They are based in Europe so English isn't their first (or second) language.  And it seems like each moderator interprets their ToS differently, so one moderator may reject your post or review, but another one will allow it.  Believe me, I've had battles with them, some I've won and some I've given up in frustration.  But in the end, keep in mind, no matter how much research you do, there's this thing called chemistry.  Many times an escort will have numerous glowing reviews, yet someone will have a bad experience.  It happens.  YMMV"
Hookers,2gtsc7,Icanhazcomment,1 point,Thu Sep 25 23:08:13 2014 UTC,"That happened to me in the past, many times! There are many resources out there that can help you out, for example you can see if she has reviews on Eccie or on other platforms, however I find it difficult to cross-check an escort based on her username.  I've downloaded HoneyPot! and this app is actually pretty clever! Whenever you find an escort you might be interested in, simply enter her phone number in the app and read what it says. By cross-checking the escort this way you increase your chances of not getting ripped-off."

Hookers,2gruwc,jtbrown1,2,Thu Sep 18 16:27:05 2014 UTC,Happens quite often.   Backpages and Craigslist are notorious for fake pictures.  I would say at least 80-90% are fake or not recent.  You did great.  I have done the same.  One time I arrived at a location and some female came out stating the girl in the picture isn't available and it was she who I was talking to all along.  ( I was PISSED)
Hookers,2gruwc,malibijones,1 point,Thu Sep 18 17:41:03 2014 UTC,How do you avoid situations like this in the future?
Hookers,2gruwc,malibijones,1 point,Thu Sep 18 17:57:35 2014 UTC,"unfortunately you can't unless you go see a well reviewed woman (on TER) who has multiple reviews stating the picture is her.   This is kinda the price of admission for this sort of hobbying.  Probably why street walkers are more interesting because you SEE what you are getting.  With that said DON'T GO GET A STREET WALKER.     If you don't take this hobby too seriously try TO approach it with the mentality of ""finding a gem or diamond in the rough""."
Hookers,2gruwc,gothbull,2,Fri Sep 19 02:04:23 2014 UTC,"Hmmmm, to be honest, majority of the asian BP ads are fake. Actually almost 97% of the BP ads are fake. One Asian BP ad was a japanese idol I fallowed her from around 2006, but still the girl I got in return was actually very very very beautiful a kind of girl I would take to see the family. On TER, almost every review I read was ""she wasn't the girl in the ads"" or ""the photos are older and she gained some weight."" So you have to take it with a grain of salt, and go ""well I'm gonna get off, maybe she's okay enough"""
Hookers,2gruwc,shoobiedoo,2,Fri Sep 19 00:38:52 2014 UTC,"You did the right thing. They probably get a lot of guys who are horny enough that they just say ""fuckit"" and go through with it even though they're being cheated. I'm still new to this, but I now know to assume that I might need to visit two or three before I find one that feels right. It seems like most of them just find Japanese avidol photos and use those. On my last trip I got lucky and the woman who greeted me was even more beautiful than the photo. I even told her she didn't have to use fake pictures, but she had no idea what I was saying.   My goto is, ""Cool I'm just gonna go get some cash."" and then bail. I'm sure they hear it all the time."

To be honest the biggest problem with this is you technically have nothing written in writing that you can ""keep"" a video or a ""photo"".

Hookers,2gfry6,neverbeenherebefore1,1 point,Mon Sep 15 06:32:39 2014 UTC,"To be honest it's not really the amount of reviews you should be concerned with.  Take a good look at the reviewer's history.   If the reviewer has multiple reviews over a period of time I would be more inclined to trust him.   If the provider only has one excellent review, from a ""new"" reviewer who doesn't have any other reviews... I tend to be suspicious. BUT.... since you're in a smaller market... I would take that into consideration and be ok with at least 2 reviews.   Just keep in mind if the reviewers are ""New"" and haven't reviewed anyone else... that they may not be legit.   ( the skeptic in me since I have done this for over 10 years)."
Hookers,2gfry6,malibijones,1 point,Mon Sep 15 14:10:44 2014 UTC,"Its pretty simple. You and the provider are both trying to determine if each of you is ""real"" and if it is safe and worthwhile spending time together. Look at whatever information you can find about the provider, their website, reviews - I like TER but there are other places to check too. BTW, take the reviews with a grain of salt. Most providers will screen and you will likely have to provide some information. Talk to them - it goes without saying that explicit conversations are a no no. But you can usually get a sense of the person on the other end of the phone pretty quickly. Then use your judgement. Be respectful, be safe, have a great time."

The only girls who aren't full service are the ones that state that they don't do it (and I guess the ones offering hand jobs only, too).

Excellent value compared to North America and even if you get a dud, no problem - just get another one.  At a certain point, the trip is about conserving your liquid resources (heh heh) and not about your cash.   I was in Indonesia in 2009 (loved it!) but the attitude has hardened toward white guys. Recent reports in internationalsexguide.info have noted that some girls are reluctant to go with foreigners, since there have been some AIDS outbreaks.  http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/news/red-light-district-closures-in-surabaya-prompt-fear-of-hivaids-infections/  Similiarly, you have to be very careful in Philipines because BBFS is common, and drug resistant gonorrhea has a foothold too. Mind you - I've had the big G and it's no fun. Every piss is like pissing needles.   Thailand - I'd be really careful. It's a huge sex tourist destination and attracts the worst low-lifes from all over. As a cultural destination it's pretty awesome.   A really safe experience is in Singapore - in Geylang, the girls get regular checkups and are there voluntarily. (i.e. no human trafficking) Costs run about US$50 per half hour.

After looking over and replying to a few ads and not really finding what I wanted, I decided to post an ad of my own, and within a day I received a reply from a woman who I felt comfortable meeting. She was close to my age, intelligent, compassionate, and pretty too. We met and talked over coffee Friday evening, and agreed to a date last night. It went amazingly well, more than I ever expected. Surprisingly I wasn't all that nervous, I think our mini-date Friday helped put my mind at ease, knowing that there was chemistry between us.  Since I didn't feel right inviting a stranger home, I decided to splurge on a nice hotel room for our date. I also thought it'd be nice to dress up and try to make myself look my best, if stockings, a skirt, and sweater counts. I had asked (nicely!) that she dress up as well, and she sure did! We started off just snuggling on the couch, kissing and lightly touching one another. It was...different than what I've experienced with men but in a good way. I just followed her lead as we undressed and continued to kiss and touch, loving every minute of it. Eventually she moved to the floor and ate me out, and oh my god...I came, a lot. I stopped her after three, and I just had to return the favor. I kind of felt a sense of accomplishment getting her off the first time with my mouth and fingers, and just kep going, I was really enjoying myself. Somewhere along the line we ended up moving from the couch to the bed, and after we finished we just snuggled under a blanket with a glass of wine each until she had to leave. For those who are curious, she is indeed a professional but did this ""off the clock"" so to speak. From our initial contact on Friday she said that our date would be personal as opposed to ""work"" for her.  I'm really glad I finally took the chance and decided to give another woman a try, I've thought about it off and on for years, but never had the guts to act on it. It was just an incredible feeling to explore another side of my sexuality."

"" Given with the amount of volume providers see, why is there not more concern over the health risks in many of the review sites and forums?""  I think you have to define ""high volume"".  What number is high?  As for not seeing concerns listed.. I think it depends on the sites you are visiting and the communities that post there.     ""do people just choose to ignore this aspect of the hobby?""  No... I think you may be looking for a discussion in the wrong areas.  If you're looking for this type of discussion in a ""hook up"" area (site/thread)... you're not going to get it.     "" I say this because on those sites, there's very little discussion on on providers getting tested as well as customers. ""  Well for a hobby that is currently illegal in the US (outside of the bunny ranches)... no one performs backgrounds checks for a one time visit.   If a provider told me she was ""tested"" I wouldn't take her at face value.  No one would."
Hookers,2fwyf6,super-nsfw,1 point,Tue Sep 9 16:03:46 2014 UTC,"I guess it comes down to your last point, where you mention that you wouldn't take a provider's word at face value. Wouldn't that make people uncomfortable or make people discontinue their hobbying? knowing that they are having intercourse with someone who's had a high volume of partners?  I had my 1st and only encounter about a year ago (protected vaginal, unprotected oral). It was great until i realized, that i had just had sex with someone who's had 100's of partners (just estimating, not sure obviously). That didn't sit well in my head and i'm still kicking myself for it. Just the thought of what she could have contracted makes me nervous. Since then i understood I was not ready to accept that risk. I have met 2 other providers since then but not for intercourse at all (just for massage / masturbation).   Recently did an oral swab test, came back negative. I am still afraid though, I can't wrap my head on why people wouldn't take this into consideration before engaging in these activities (like i initially did)"

Wouldn't that make people uncomfortable or make people discontinue their hobbying? knowing that they are having intercourse with someone who's had a high volume of partners?""  No.. not at all.  I suppose it depends on ""Why"" you are seeing a provider to begin with.  If you looking to fulfill a sexual need with ZERO emotional connection to that person... then what that other person does is of no consequence.  I would rather see a woman who is experienced in sexual positions and performance than someone who has never had sex before or has no skills.   But back to your thoughts... if you're concerned with how many people she has been with before strictly from a health perspective then you're playing a percentage game.   I imagine your reasoning is "" If she's only been with one other man.. chances are she is clean"".   That line of thinking would be wrong.   What if the only man she has ever been with had HIV or an STD?  I do understand your thinking and position ( I really do).  Unfortunately this ""hobby"" isn't for those who are concerned with the number of men in her background (generally).   But there are Wifes/girlfriends/desperate students who only provide services once in a while to pay bills so their millage is low.  If you chose to go this route I suggest you steer clear of women desperate for cash.  Many of them (not all) will attempt to rip you off by not performing any service or using fake pictures to lure you in."

Hookers,2fwyf6,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Sep 11 03:24:55 2014 UTC,"Unprotected PIV Sex:   herpes 1 - unlikely unless you do oral. But you probably already have herpes 1 anyways... herpes 2 - high risk. It's common and cannot be cured. But after about 2 years most people don't get outbreaks. (That said, I don't want it!) HPV of all types - very high risk, but contrary to popular opinion, you do NOT have it for life. Your body will eliminate it eventually and then you'll be immune. The problem is some strains can cause cervical or throat cancer, but it's rare. Source:http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus HIV - low risk. Even if she has it, it doesn't easily transmit to the guy. And she likely doesn't have it... chlamydia - very high risk. It's common. It's easily transmitted. But it's easily curable. gonorrhea - very high risk. It's common. It's easily transmitted. Unfortunately it's not easily curable. There are newer resistant strains out there. syphilis - low risk. It's a rare disease. It's easily transmitted, but it is very easy to treat.    Protected PIV sex   herpes 1 - just get it already. Most people have it. herpes 2 - if an uncovered portion of your skin touches and uncovered portion of her skin and it's an area she has a current herpes outbreak--ie, possible but highly unlikely HPV, possible but even less likely than herpes 2 HIV - possible but it's so unlikely no point in mentioning it.  chlamydia - possible but far less likely. If you get her juices on your tip while taking off the condom or tough her vagina and then touch your tip, you could get it. She would have some pain and discharge if she has it though. If it looks messed up down there, walk away. gonorhea - similar story as chlamydia here syphilis - I'm not sure on thus one. My guess is condom reduces chance a lot, but I'm not sure if you can get this from simply touching a sore on her body. Then again, stay the hell away from people with sores on their body... In any case, it's easily curable.   BBBJ : the controversial one!   herpes 1 - yes, both kinds of herpes can live in both places. But it's rare to see crossover. Herpes 1 can easily live in the oral area, and can sometimes appear generally. If she has oral herpes and is having an outbreak, she may give it to you on your dick. But since you probably already have herpes 1, the outbreak will be very mild or non-noticeable and will not usually return. If you don't have herpes 1, you'll get it full blown on your dick. Congrats. It's not so bad. herpes 2 - again, yes herpes 2 can reside in her mouth, but it's very very unlikely. Herpes 2 generally does not like to reside in the oral area at all. HPV - unlikely, but still possible. I wouldn't worry about it. Get Gardasil if you're so worried about HPV.  HIV : if she has a full blown infection and bites your dick and her tongue and transmits her blood into yours, you could get it. Otherwise, no. You can't get HIV from a bbbj. chlamydia - if she has it orally, you can get it easily this way. But likely she'd be sick and have a sore throat. Again, don't fuck sick hookers. Gonnorhea - similar to chlamydia here syphilis - if she has mouth sores she can give it to you.   CBJ   herpes 1 can be transmitted this way if a bit of her saliva runs down the side of the condom and touches the base of your penis. It's very unlikely. herpes 2 - similar story to herpes 1, but remember it's very rare to see oral herpes 2 in the first place. HPV - not entirely sure. I'm not stressing out about it. HIV - not a chance chlamydia - similar story as herpes here. Don't see sick hookers and don't get her juices all over you. Gonorhea - similar as herpes and chlamydia in this scenario. syphilis - I genuinely don't know. I'm guessing it's low risk. Seriously, no one has syphilis anymore.   CONCLUSION   If you see the typical moderately upscale $100-200 incall, 2 call system provider with some reviews, wear a condom for everything, and do not get her juices all over you, then you will probably not get any STD. But if you do it, get tested regularly. If you add bbbj, as many do, likely you're fine. Don't stress out over every red bump on your dick. Red bumps usually mean nothing.  If you see the $300-500 high end escort type and use a condom, Id bet my life savings you won't get an std at all. It's far more risky to go to a bar and pick up some drunk chick.  If you want sources, this is all on Wikipedia and the CDC Website. The cdc is a bit more cautious bc it's job is to protect the public. Transmission studies are done with couples and results are reported on Wikipedia for each std.    (REMARK: When it comes to stds, be careful. But many guys stress out over every red bump or mark they see. But these marks usually mean nothing. They can be balantis, a yeast infection, or general inflammation (ironically made worse by the worrying and fondling if their penis). An std like herpes usually presents as intensely itchy and painful, with ulcerated sores. You'll know it when you see it. A couple red bumps on your dick head probably just mean you jerked off too hard.)"

Book with said girls for a session and at the end of the session ask if she can provide what you want.  If she's game then book for that session in the future.  In the end it is all going to come down to rapport and trying different girls until you find one willing.

People lie in reviews all the time for various reasons.  Shills, lap dogs, people with axes to grind, competing girls, and any number of other types of users have all been known to lie in reviews to suit their own whims.

Take all reviews with a grain of salt, long and short, because not only does YMMV, but the reviewer may have caught the provider on a particularly good or bad day, the reviewer may have had a particularly good or bad day, we don't know the reviewer's hygiene (you don't brush & floss you get no DFK; you don't wash your ass well you'll get no undercarriage work done), some providers just will not give a BBBJ to the uncircumcised, the reviewer just might have been too big for a provider to handle a particular requested act,  and sometimes a reviewer just has an ax to grind."

I saw the HBO show Cathouse whe I was 13 or 14 and thought that those women lived their lives so independently - free of the opinions of those who thought otherwise. I worked in the spa industry as well full time for many years, making people feel relaxed and pampered comes very naturally to me. I always kept in mind the brothels in case I ever felt like I needed an adventure. I wasn't feeling fulfilled financially, emotionally, etc in my spa jobs and so decided to go full time in the sex industry. I did independent work, dated sugar daddies, did web cam modeling since I was 18 (23 now.)  How has it effected my personally... Pros - Coming out as a sex worker to all my friends (I have a group of about 120 friends who are all pretty interconnected as well) was a huge weight off my shoulders. I felt like I could be honest about a huge part of myself and they all have been more supportive than I could have ever imagined. The money is amazing. My job is amazing. My clients are awesome.  Meh(?) My boyfriend does adult work (pornography) as well. It hasn't been easy to be away from him for 6-8 weeks at a time and our own struggles deciding between an open relationship vs. monogamy outside of work have been rough lately.   Neg- I also worry that people who are less tolerant and understanding will slander my name through the mud back home. But ""Those who matter don't mind, and those who mind don't matter"" has been my motto for a long time now.  My parents are only slightly aware of what I do. I told them recently over a dinner than I had left my spa job to work in the adult industry. They don't support my decision but they know what they think isn't going to sway my decision.  On a whole becoming a prostitute full-time has allowed me the freedoms with my time and financially I was never going to achieve at my position at the spa. I have started working out 5-6x a week, I have time to meditate and write. I am much less stressed. I'm much happier than I have been in a long time.

Hookers,2figie,puffonish,5,Mon Sep 15 04:41:27 2014 UTC,"Rates are decided by the woman working and depend on the activities during, the duration of the appointment, and you yourself (are you pleasant to be around, smell nice/presentable, etc). Some women are more firm on their pricing, some others are willing to work with your budget.   As for the actual rates - not something I can discuss outside of the brothel.  The house takes a 50% cut, and take into mind that there are weekly STD tests, registration with the county, brothel rent and all the cost of maintenance and travel that we account into the pricing.  An appointment at a brothel is generally going to be more expensive than seeing an independent contractor working illegally.

Secondly, If you decide to book a provider with the intent of anal sex, look for one that offers GREEK.  Be sure you let the provider know in your initial contact that you are seeking this particular act, as it requires prep time.  Also, you may need to book at least an hour of time so make sure everything is comfortable for her."
Hookers,2fi64v,CallAnna,1 point,Fri Sep 5 01:58:06 2014 UTC,Thank you. I know the bareback thing is completely dumb and thanks for internet kick in the nuts type of thing. Thanks for the info for anal as well.
Hookers,2fi64v,manslutalt,1 point,Fri Sep 5 02:53:30 2014 UTC,"Yeah I cannot express how incredibly stupid the bareback thing is. If a girl offers you bareback then you can be sure she has done it many times before with other men. And those men have done it many times with other women. You're basically shouting out to every STD in the world that your cock is a party and they're invited.  Blowjobs are OK in my opinion, because the rate of transmission is much lower for most STDs. But vaginal and especially anal have very high rates of transmission."
Hookers,2fi64v,gothbull,2,Fri Sep 5 09:55:43 2014 UTC,"I doubt that's going to happen, especially removing the condom. Majority of Escorts and Massage parlors do covered blowjobs to prevent stds.   The only way I could see that happening is if you were involved with a provider for over years and you show her a piece of paper showing your clean of STDs."
Hookers,2fi64v,CreepyJon,1 point,Fri Sep 5 09:40:38 2014 UTC,Even I wouldn't dare go bare...
Hookers,2fgitm,imonbusiness,3,Thu Sep 4 14:58:36 2014 UTC,"usually the info you need is right in her ad. the vast majority of girls charge 200 an hour, but will expect the date to end as soon as you cum.  if she is a pro and does an extra special job she might expect and deserve a tip. the sex acts she will provide are the standard ones. if you want something unusual she will probably charge extra. most will not discuss this over the phone because a lot of guys call them for free phone sex, and they are all paranoid about cops. 99% of escorts will not french kiss you (they feel it is too intimate) unless the ad says ""gfe"" which means ""girl friend experience"". as far as getting started, most girls will want to start asap because time is money. i always have to slow them down. they usually remove their clothes instantly, but i like to see their underwear, though many do not wear any. in any event they will not be shy about telling you what to do. be careful with your money and valuables. leave everything in the car except the money you are going to pay her with. don't over think it, but remember they are women so some of the things they do will not make rational sense."
Hookers,2fgitm,paulkersey1999,1 point,Sun Sep 7 00:23:16 2014 UTC,"well, rates is simple. You can just say ""how much for an hour session."" And she might say a number or even the code ""200 roses."" Still it's enough to be vague enough to not really cause alarms. You could do this by phone or text, you shouldn't worry about that.  Depends on the escort, sometimes they want money up front there are some who prefer to be paid after. Most of the time, they explain rules up front and then money comes up.  When she takes the money almost all the time the clothes come off. But yeah some women are different, they could be wanting to chat, some want to be business up front. Just try to give some room and see what kind of person they are, because most of the time they are super sweet and want repeat business with you."
Hookers,2fgitm,gothbull,1 point,Thu Sep 4 19:38:10 2014 UTC,"You simply ask for an hour session rate.    As for payment.. leave it in plain sight. I  myself have never done the envelope thing.. but you can do that too.  If she is coming to you I would start to get undressed after she is in the room.  Make  small talk about her day, nice outfit.. what ever.  DO NOT get nervous and talk about first time or law enforcement.  you'll be fine"
Hookers,2fcyit,mereniTA,5,Wed Sep 3 14:39:09 2014 UTC,"Are you setting an appointment or walking in? There's no such thing as a bad time. In fact, I prefer mornings.  I'm relatively new to the scene but I'll give my basic tips:   Don't go to an AMP. If you're losing your virginity, go find a well reviewed provider (see list of review resources on the sidebar) that piques your interest. Plop down the cash for an hour minimum, preferably two hours so you have time to get comfortable. It'll make your first time a trillion times better.   With that being said... AMP tips:   Obviously don't talk about LEO. That'd just be dumb. Get naked. Don't leave your undergarments on or they'll take it as a sign that you're not ""in the know"" and just want a regular massage. You might not get full service (or anything!) your first time. If they're sketched out about you, they'll just give you a massage and call it a day. Don't tip beforehand. Wait until the girl either asks you what extras you want so you know what your money is going to."
Hookers,2fcyit,mg03throwaway,1 point,Wed Sep 3 17:05:05 2014 UTC,"Also this is going to get very expensive very fast, so I hope you have deep pockets :) I visit escorts about twice a month with FBSMs in-between and it's costly but a lot of fun.  Visiting the bay area next week for work and I'm excited to see what the girls that direction are like."
Hookers,2fcyit,mg03throwaway,1 point,Wed Sep 3 17:09:12 2014 UTC,"I assume know of aamps?  Lately, I've been mostly seeing aamp girls so I can definitely give you some recommendations by PM if you like."
Hookers,2fcyit,unhealthyadvice,1 point,Thu Sep 4 01:33:08 2014 UTC,"""•You might not get full service (or anything!) your first time"" - THIS!  I usually had to visit a place twice before they got comfortable with me.  After a 5th visit the old Mamasan gave be a ""Reward Card""... I shit you not!  Took all I had not to laugh when she started to explain the reward system after so many visits.  If this is your first visit don't go in with ""high"" expectations.  Treat it as a ""trial"" run and enjoy yourself."
Hookers,2fcyit,malibijones,2,Thu Sep 4 13:53:46 2014 UTC,"So here is exactly what is going to happen.  Buzz the door, you will wait uncomfortably for 20 seconds while the mamasan comes to the door.  The mamasan will be some old asian lady.  They are universally over 70, under 5 feet tall and have their hair in a bun.  She will either lead you to a room or call a girl who will lead you to a room.  At some you can ask for a lineup, don't do it this time since some don't like that.  If you really don't like who she gives you just say you didn't realize the time and say you'll be back in an hour.  It happens all the time to them and they will not take offense to it as long as you are super polite.    Read up on what regular tips are.   The mamasan MAY take the room fee (usually $60-$80).  Either way once you are in the room the girl will ask you if you want a table shower.  Say yes.  She will leave for a few minutes while you get undressed.  Take this opportunity to lay the tip out very clearly on the table.  Don't hand it to her.  Just leave it there. She'll see it.  Also NEVER hand it directly to her.  Like ever.  She'll think you are a cop.  She'll give you a shower. It will probably be awesome.  It can be uncomfortable making small talk while some girl, who you can barely understand, asks you trite questions while washing your balls.  Smile and try to be friendly and polite.  I sometimes close my eyes and enjoy the table shower, and this is a sign to the girl to just crank away and wash up.  Once you get back to the room you'll be going face down.  Honestly at this point there is literally no way you can screw up. She'll give you a massage and in about 15 minutes she'll start light touching your body, which is a sign that you're about to get the good stuff.  Let her lead the way and you'll be fine.  One warning during this time is a lot of girls will really try to get you to cum by blowing you (or handjobbing).  Just simply ask her to get into what position when you feel that you've had enough.  They'll comply most of the time, and if they don't they'll get the hint.  Really the only reason they won't comply to a simple suggestion is that they are a bad provider, sore or overworked.  But 9 times out of 10 if you ask them if they could do doggy style (for example) you'll get it super willingly.    Honestly, it's about the same as getting a haircut.  There is just so much stigma and nerves that you think that you can do something wrong.  You really can't, unless you're an asshole or not clean."
Hookers,2fcyit,analfuck,1 point,Thu Sep 4 13:09:42 2014 UTC,"Very good info, the only thing I would change is that most of the time they get to a point where they ask you something like what extra do you want, or have you done this before and what did you do with the other girls who massaged you. They just want to make sure you are not a cop or going to give them a problem. don't be pushy and you will have a good time. I usually don't do doggy with them I like to bang them out face to face and that table usually sucks for doggy style."
Hookers,2fcyit,docphan,2,Thu Sep 4 14:15:30 2014 UTC,"Good call.  I NEVER say its my first time in a place.  If she asks who you saw just bring a name with you from a rubmaps review like a year ago.  Or just make up a name, they'll just move on."

Hookers,2fbbc6,RoddyPiper77,1 point,Wed Sep 3 02:22:38 2014 UTC,"There are no gaurantees... even those providers who screen get caught on occasions.  I have heard a good way for providers to ""screen"" you is by checking with other providers you have seen.   Just like us.. they talk about who they see and if he's safe.  The one things I never do is give a provider my personal information ( drivers license) and or work information... some ask for that as well.  If you're single.. then this wouldn't be a big deal I imagine.  If you're married or have a significant other... this is very big no no."
Hookers,2fbbc6,malibijones,3,Wed Sep 3 02:58:59 2014 UTC,lol I can only imagine the stupid shit you'd day to turn off a girlfriend as she started to play with your dick. Don't blame anyone buy yourself. Well reviewed = probably not law enforcement. Once you're in a room and you put money down if law enforcement wants to bust you they will.
Hookers,2fbbc6,gothbull,1 point,Wed Sep 3 14:05:23 2014 UTC,"Agreed.  I want to play this safe, and I'd also like to be P411 or date-check verified but I don't want to give my real name.

Hookers,2fbbc6,ProtonDeathRay,2,Thu Sep 4 13:46:07 2014 UTC,You should never have mentioned law enforcement.  Sounds like you freaked her out with the question.  All providers are like that.

I got frustrated spending too much money on a girl on a date and she wouldn't even wear my jacket when its cold outside and she's clearly cold.

The fact that somebody would take a train for two hours to bring me roses when they are not somebody i am romantically involved or interested in is strange.

That's just how I am, I like to be generous to people who treat me with respect.  But anyway:  I was more getting at talking to the madams and providers in person, like when journalists do so.  Most interviews I've seen are published on blogs so I don't reckon there would be much money changing hands with someone running a small blog.  I'm a bit of a girl when among girls, and I love the whole relationship they have with each other, e.g you hear them talking quite openly to clients.

Hookers,2eueud,newescortguy001,2,Thu Aug 28 18:24:35 2014 UTC,"Unfortunately, the short answer to your question is probably not.  The LA kgirl community has been fairly closed for at least the last few years.  You could get in if you were vouched for by someone well established on the inside or some orgs might accept you after a relatively thorough screening process.  But recently an org in OC got busted so they've been even more skittish lately according to some forum chatter.  You should still try, but just be prepared to make alternate plans for fun if the kgirl option doesn't pan out.  My advice to maximize your chances are to get a local number (213, 310, 818 area code) since they're much more likely to go through the trouble of verifying you if you're likely to become a regular customer.  Also, the kgirl stars can be hard to book even for guys who are already ""in"" so I'd focus my efforts on newer or less popular girls."
Hookers,2eueud,unhealthyadvice,1 point,Fri Aug 29 02:48:11 2014 UTC,Being a level 0 newbie with no in person network on HX isn't going to get you anywhere with the K-Girl community. Join the N00bz club and check the Asian Agencies to see who schedules appointments with Newbs. Having seen someone in your area who remembers you and can be reached for verification purposes will definitely help.
Hookers,2etjln,jond8970,2,Thu Aug 28 13:25:55 2014 UTC,"You can have a girl verify you with work info, that's how I got to see my first upscale girl. She could also run a background check on you.  Another option is to verify with an agency, the agency would allow you to see a bunch of different girls without having to go through the verification process every time."
Hookers,2etjln,fanumber1troll,1 point,Thu Aug 28 14:10:25 2014 UTC,ok but im asking about the ones that require references to see them. How do references work without signing up for p411 or TER. Do i just give the person I'm trying to meet my references email/phone number?
Hookers,2etjln,cinderellasteps,1 point,Thu Aug 28 14:45:39 2014 UTC,"When providers ask for references, they are generally referring to other providers whom you've seen previously who can vouch for you: essentially that you were legit, safe, clean, and respectful. After you have seen a few ladies, you can then provide them as references to other providers you are interested in seeing who require this information for their screening. As an aside, it is common courtesy to first ask a lady you've seen to confirm that she'd be comfortable providing a reference for you before doing so."
Hookers,2etjln,fanumber1troll,1 point,Thu Aug 28 15:04:48 2014 UTC,"Yes, once you get the references that's the protocol. However, there's no law that says a girl has to refer you. Also, rule of thumb is usually 1 session = 1 referral, don't expect a girl to refer you to multiple girls months down the line if you only saw her once, she probably won't even remember you."

In my general philosophy, generally people take depressants to get through something unpleasant.  Stimulants are for people who find life in tolerable without the faux-euphoria to get them through the day.  Basically, if she's doing meth' it's because she hates her life, not you specifically.     Ethically, I would say that feeding her habit has the same cost benefit considerations as providing for any other reason.    The only unethical thing would be if you decided to push her boundaries more so that you otherwise have due to your knowledge of her habit...  e.g. engaged in some non-consensual sadism or just unsafe practices because you thought you could get away with it due to her judgment being impaired."

Hookers,2eqxs4,malibijones,3,Mon Sep 1 02:58:04 2014 UTC,"It happens to all of us at one point of another.  The way to combat it is by using reviewed (TER - I always preach The Erotic Review) providers who make a good living in the business.  If you are using someone you found on backpages.com, craigs list..etc..etc... never ever pay more than 100 to 150.  I don't care how good they look.  Pay for the half hour or 15 minute quickie.  I have never met a provider outside of TER or RED BOOK (RIP) that gave a full hour.  It's happened to me as well.. one tried complaining I was taking too long to finish (after 4 minutes) and another pulled a stunt similar to yours.    Best you can do is follow EscortVoyerAdmin example.. post your experience somewhere to warn other Hobbyist.   TER has thousands of stories of RIP off experiences that warn fellow hobbyist to avoid girls and phone numbers.  I don't mind being burned everyonce in a while... cause the other guys that got burned and warned me about other girls saved me from plenty of bad experiences.

Hookers,2eoeew,virginguy313,6,Tue Aug 26 23:57:53 2014 UTC,"It means that she won't suck your dick without a condom, but she wants to charge $250+, so she'll act like she's into having sex with you."
Hookers,2eoeew,EscortVoyeurAdmin,2,Wed Aug 27 05:20:12 2014 UTC,"GFE, as you probably already know, stands for girlfriend experience.  There's really no universally accepted definition of what that means really.  If you ask 10 different providers/clients, you'll get 10 different answers.  Some define it in terms of a list of menu items of things a girl will allow during a session.  Others will definite it as more of an attitude that the girl has in seeming warmer and more actively engaged with the client during the session.  In the end, a session being advertised as gfe or light gfe doesn't mean too much unless the girl herself states what it means.  Oddly, it's much more significant if a girl specifies that she's non-gfe.  In that case, you can be pretty sure that means no kissing at all, and everything is covered (ie with condom)."
Hookers,2eoeew,unhealthyadvice,2,Wed Aug 27 00:41:02 2014 UTC,"Usually GFE is defined as RedBook GFE: DFK, BBBJ, DATY, CFS, & MSOG, or Deep French Kissing, Bareback (condomless) Blow Job, Uncovered ""Dining at the 'Y'"" (cunnilingus), Covered Full Service (vaginal sex with a condom), and ""Multiple Shots on Goal"" (allowing the client more than one orgasm during the session).   Usually Light GFE means some combination of only Light French Kissing or even just light kissing without tongue, CBJ/Covered Blow Job, covered or no DATY, and no MSOG. You'll have to ask the provider exactly what she means by Light GFE."

If money ever comes up it should be only ever about donation for an amount of time.  If you get there and she tries to say ""okay it is $X for Y"" activity you clearly state ""I'm not here to pay for Y.  I simply wanted to spend some time with a pretty lady. I'm sorry if you were confused about my intentions, I need to leave now"".  Come in and have the agreed upon amount in a plain envelope in your pocket.  At the door will be the hellos and then she'll lead you to her room.  Once in the room take the envelope out of your pocket and place it on the bedside dresser.  Do not hand it to her directly.  After you place it down on the dresser ask if you can freshen up in the restroom.  This quick popping out will give her a chance to pick up the donation and/or make sure it is all there.  Simply go into the bathroom and splash some water on your face, wash your hands really well, and rinse your mouth out. Come back and you'll probably get a ""thank you"" from the girl and things should progress nicely from there.  Enjoy."

And in your case, are more or less deterred by the regulatory protections  And you're an idiot for equating cumming on a woman's body with bareback anything.  I garan-fucking-tee you that she will beat your ass if you go in asking for bare-back full service after being allowed to cum on her body.  Seriously, due to the tissues involved, cumming on a provider's unbroken skin is an order of magnitude safer than cumming in their mouths...  Unless you're one of Riddely Scott's aliens - your jizz isn't nuclear acid that burns through aero-space steel is it?  Cumming in a woman's mouth is safer than cumming in a v-j as the juices get deposited into a place that destroys them pretty quickly, but still slide past some sensitive tissues on the way down... As opposed to BBFS, where your juices and any bugs they may contain are basically designed to stew in a v-j.  Cumming in a v-j is safer than bb-anal as the anal tissues are at a greater risk for some sort of tear than the v-j."

So putting myself in her shoes, she does want a boyfriend, but doesn't want to give up the income and doesn't think it would be ok to date you and continue what she does, causing cognitive dissonance.  The thought of getting out for good, almost rescued in a sense, as even when making good money and not coerced, there is always the fear of aging out/hitting our expiration date, and what then?  She is being pragmatic.   Also, the prospect of going on a date at some future date feels way different when you actually have to try to schedule it and you find you don't really have the time or energy to do it.  Also, it could just be a temporary bout of depression.  I think you should ask her very frankly to be honest with you, maybe link her to this thread."

Hookers,2e4wdh,thrash242,1 point,Sat Oct 4 02:49:46 2014 UTC,it does sound like a lapse in her better judgement but I do think it's a bit of intimacy your still paying for that's not just sex. Who knows? Talk to her about maybe you could still be her client and her friend.
Hookers,2e4p2z,AwesumWill,1 point,Wed Aug 20 23:36:44 2014 UTC,"As a guy? If she is open to another round, you can do that. It really depends on the dynamics between you two and how much time you have left and if she is open to MSOG.  If either of you aren't open to another go you can just cuddle, maybe take a shower together, maybe if you're at a hotel go downstairs and get a drink... It kind of depends."
Hookers,2e4p2z,collegeguy1492,1 point,Thu Aug 21 00:37:52 2014 UTC,"If she offers MSOG, you can take a break and go for round two.  Otherwise, conversation, backrubs, a soak in the jacuzzi.... to fill up the rest of the appointment"

I just try to stay focus and just not think about and think of the most blandest thing in the world like baseball. I can go for 3 hours just staying focused. A lot of providers are stunned I remain hard, it's like they aren't satisfied till I get off. Seeing a woman take pride in her work is a special sight to behold.  If you pop early, I'd go, ""lets do 69, let me get you off too."" Then you can get hard again and go for round two."

Hookers,2e1etl,malibijones,1 point,Wed Aug 20 14:00:14 2014 UTC,BackPage.com is  hit or miss.   I would say 80% of the pictures are fake (or very old as someone else mentioned).  I have had a 50% success rate the actual girl in the picture is the one at the door.   As for getting good service?  Again hit or miss...  If you're skeptical of the picture (like I tend to be).. run it through Google.. or Tineye.com to verify (to yourself) it's not from a porn site or someone else's page.  I would say use backpage if you're adventurous or looking for a diamond in the ruff (in a good way).

Grown ass men can be really childish sometimes.   Everything on TER or any review site is a bit of a challenge. You still have to do your research. Listen to reputable reviewers for girls that aren't as well known/established.   If there is an established provider, from her multitude of reviews and professional pages and stuff. I wouldn't be as picky. But sometimes just browse reviews to get an idea of what to expect. Whether my kinks are acceptable etc."
Hookers,2dzyc6,fanumber1troll,2,Tue Aug 19 18:31:48 2014 UTC,What was she rated? You don't want to see a girl if she has bad reviews.
Hookers,2dzyc6,malibijones,2,Tue Aug 19 18:37:36 2014 UTC,She had a good review stating the individual would repeat. The simplicity of the review put me on the edge so to speak.
Hookers,2dzyc6,walterfnch,1 point,Tue Aug 19 18:43:36 2014 UTC,"Stick with TER.   The key to the reviews are based on the 1) the reviewer (how many he has given) and 2) the number of reviews the provider has.  If the provider has only one review, from a new reviewer (no track record) I would be skeptical about the review.   If the provider is new and there are multiple reviews I would feel more comfortable regardless of her ""rating"".   Multiple reviews help you determine validity of her services and performance.   A few bad reviews among a sea of excellent reviews will tell you there might have been isolated incidents with just those men and is not a reflection on her service.   A lot of bad reviews would simply mean she's not up to snuff.  A lot of this boils down to common sense and realizing YMMV ( you millage may vary).  Just because she does something with you doesn't mean everyone gets the same treatment ( good or bad).  TER is too reliable a resource to simply blow off  (in regards to reviews)."

Hookers,2dzyc6,walterfnch,0,Tue Aug 19 21:39:35 2014 UTC,"TER is the way to go. If there is one review, I tend to stay away. Unless I""m feeling adventurous. on TER one review could just be a pimp or someone posting a fake review. So proceed with caution.  Tips and tricks:  1. If you're attached in any way, make sure you're not using something that is traceable. Maybe a throwaway phone or a google voice number. 2. Related to above, don't go out of the norm and stay late for work to pursue your hobby. That will become suspicious fast. 3. Know what you want - be informed by reading reviews when calling a girl/agency. Most of the time these agencies/girls are short on the phone because of the high volume of calls.  4. If its an independent girl, then call and confirm the appt 1 hour before. Before you leave for her location etc. 5. Scope out the location, drive around the entire hotel or place. Look for odd cars, law enforcement etc.  6. When walking into the hotel, I would be confident. Act like you belong there. I usually faked a conversation on the phone as I walked in. Acting completely nonchalant. 7. Take stairs instead of the elevator. 8. Consider walking from the opposite end of the hallway towards the door you're going to (if this is a hotel) being very aware of surroundings etc. 9. Clean up before you go - this is a big thing and I've chatted with several gals about this. The cleaner you are, the better service you'll be likely to receive. I would manscape as well. (unless you normally don't, and have a SO).  10. When you get there, take a shower, wash thoroughly. 11. Keep gum/mints before hands. Don't take a smoke break before visiting a gal. Bleh!  12. Be yourself, be cordial. Communicate up front what she's okay with what she's not okay with (this will be more of a confirmation for you based on your research beforehand, but sometimes you might be surprised).  13. Communicate what you want out of it, any special requests etc. Better communication = better time. 14. Treat her like a lady.  15. Enjoy!"

Once I watched a girl hit a crack pipe and I went and picked her up right afterwards.  She wasn't bad looking for the streets but the crack pipe was enough of a turn off that I couldn't get up.  The second time it was with one of the youngest and cleanest girls I have ever picked up.  Don't know what happened but she just wasn't doing it for me.  Especially with this being your first time I wouldn't think anything of it.  Your first sexual experience is pressure enough but to add the nerves of picking up a prostitute is a lot of pressure to put on yourself.  Keep your head up.

Hookers,2dunqu,bkdudeydude,2,Mon Aug 18 02:43:18 2014 UTC,"Here's my experience with NYC massage parlors:   If you need to be buzzed in and it's upstairs, there's a much better chance they offer happy endings. If they are on street level, it's rare. If they offer a table shower, they offer happy ending. If their ads talk about the massage, it's likely legit. If their ads talk about the girls, you're likely to get off. Best bet is to get naked when they ask you to lay down. That signals you're open to happy ending.  Some times they do a lot of rubbing your inner thighs and ass while you are face down. This means they are testing you. If you act appreciative they will go further.  Sometimes they ask explicitly what you want, other times it is just looks and hand motions. I've had a few just start working my joint without saying anything.  40-60 is a good tip for hand release. Don't be pushy or ask about it, don't push their hands towards your junk. That can scare away a girl who would likely do it. Sometimes it just doesn't happen. Oh well, you got a decent massage out of it."

Hookers,2dlh9j,CallAnna,11,Fri Aug 15 01:40:30 2014 UTC,"What is going through the head of a client who develops romantic feeling for a provider and expects it to be mutual?     Have you ever developed feelings for a friend? Same thing. Some people have absolute control over their emotions, most don't. You spend enough time being intimate with somebody and feelings are bound to develop, it's human nature.    I developed feelings for a massage therapist that I had been going to for a while. Not an escort, just a regular CMT. She had all the qualities that I generally find attractive and over the course of our business relationship I developed feelings for her. I knew I was just a client but that didn't matter, I still found myself thinking about her and wanting to be with her. In the end I chose to stop seeing her rather than broach the subject and ruin the relationship.    We're not robots, we're human. We spend time with a person we're attracted to and this sort of thing becomes unavoidable."
Hookers,2dlh9j,SanFran_Throwaway,5,Fri Aug 15 02:21:20 2014 UTC,"Part of it is how the emotion of love works in the two sexes; as it was explained to me ""Women are attracted to those they love, and Men love those they're attracted to."" I'm also sure there's a little bit of wanting what you can't have in there, too.  I know some of the providers on the other side of the equation do a little of the same. From my side I guess I'm just an easy guy to be around because I've had providers fall asleep in my arms, tell me all about how their kids are doing in school in enough detail i could find them if i wanted, and tell me of the pain of having a two-timing guy commit suicide when you can't even grieve at his funeral because you're the ""other woman"". I've had two hour sessions turn into 6 on the house, and had one offer a free overnight with bonus morning sex with her & her roommate just to stay & cuddle.  People on both sides of the equation are lonely, vulnerable, and taking part in amazingly intimate activities, you're bound to get one or two who cross emotional lines thinking feelings might be, could possibly be, mutual."

Hookers,2dlh9j,StiophanOC,4,Thu Aug 21 01:55:39 2014 UTC,"About a year and a half ago I went to an escort for the first time. Found her in BP after doing some research. I liked her right away and we had a good time (at least I did). I arranged to have her spend the night with me the very next night and we went out to dinner and talked through much of the night along with making love.  She headed south for the winter the next morning and I didn't hear from her for a few months. She came back in early May and we had several ""dates"" at her hotel and a couple of overnights at my place. We were spending some time otb and I was sending her texts and emails regularly. She disappeared after a few weeks and shortly after I got a call from a girl that worked with her asking me to pick her up and drive her to the bus station. That's when I found out they were not independent as they told me they were.  She was on the west coast by this time and I called her and verified that she had been working for a pimp. That upset me as I hated the idea that the money I had given to her had been passed onto some scum bag.  She told me she had quit the business and now had a boyfriend. We kept in touch and she would confide in me at times. She struggled with her new life and one afternoon she asked if I would send her a ticket back to the east coast so we could have a visit.  By this time she was telling me that she loved me. She called me her special friend. This girl had a rough life. She had been molested by her step father from about age 11. She had a bad habit of getting into relationships that were exploitative even when she wasn't with a pimp. I let her know that I cared about her and never asked anything in return, Maybe that is why she grew to love me. Love may not be the best description as I believe she was far too wounded to love or accept real love.  She came and stayed with me for a week. I did not pay her for services although we made love regularly. I did buy her a phone and clothes and took her out nearly every night, so she did benefit from the trip.  She decided not to go back to her boyfriend on the west coast and ended up going from one really bad pimp to another and I had to rescue her more than once. That went on for about 6 months and it broke my heart.  She went back to the west coast and back with her boyfriend. She is stripping now and seems happier than she has been since I've known her. We still text usually once a week or more and have occasional phone conversations.   I love her, but not in a way I would with a more typical romantic relationship. I feel part father and part lover to her. I still try to give her encouragement and let her know that she is loved and that I care about her. We are far too different to have a normal relationship and neither one of us has ever wanted that.  I recently offered to buy her a ticket to come back for another visit, but she has not committed to anything. I don't think her boyfriend is too crazy about the idea.  I'm very grateful that I have had the opportunity to know her and will always wish nothing but good things for her."

Everybody involved needs to keep it in their head that this phenomenon is not about attraction, or sexual prowess, but is directly related to the unusual circumstances. Everybody has a latent charm and attractive qualities, and it is easy to latch on to those qualities in such a hothouse.  Another comparison would be 'teambuilding exercises', designed to break the ice in socially intense situations. Imagine that - ""First thing on the schedule is to remove your clothes and have an orgy. That will run until lunch, after which we will do module 1 of the sales workshop"".  I think the key is to acknowledge the tension, but to be very careful about leaving things hanging. I once told a girl she was ""sweet"", and she replied ""Oh, I am shameless and do some terrible things. You wouldn't like me"". Way to set yourself up for rescue by Prince Charming.  After that, I put a time on it. ""You know, it is nice to spend an hour with such a sweet person"" or ""We have to stop meeting under these circumstances. But I will probably be back..."". As a client, I value a level of emotional honesty, and like flirting with the romance of fleeting attachment. I try and give cues that that is the sort of experience I am after, but I don't want to freak the girl out.  Maybe you can push back a bit yourself and put the hopeless romantics on a less regular schedule? ""I like your visits, but I am going to have to make them monthly""."
Hookers,2dlh9j,LOVE_YOU_SHORT_TIME,2,Fri Aug 15 05:32:59 2014 UTC,Having just come from a day of revenue meetings I can honestly say that this model would certainly have made the day more interesting.
Hookers,2dlh9j,SanFran_Throwaway,2,Fri Aug 15 17:05:12 2014 UTC,Yeah... dont think im gonna be stoked on taking that pay cut.  Those hopeless romantics are keeping food in my fridge and a roof over my head.   Cutting appointments down is not going to benefit me financially
Hookers,2dlh9j,LOVE_YOU_SHORT_TIME,2,Sat Aug 16 00:56:01 2014 UTC,"I am talking about restricting appointments in cases where it is troublesome. That way you can keep a client that is a reliable stream of income, but by putting them on 'probation' for a while, you can hopefully reclaim some control over the sessions.  Emotional entanglements are a hazard of the job. If you are going to offer GFE to a high level, you invite a certain level of risk. Misunderstandings occur in such a hothouse. Especially in cases where not thinking too hard about a brewing 'misunderstanding' means guaranteed repeat business.  Long term, recognizing and stage managing such situations so they don't get out of hand is a better bet. The main point of actions like restricting sessions is to give a 'peek behind the curtain', so the client understands that this is a fantasy service they are paying for. I am sure there are other ways to provide a clearer delineation between fantasy and reality.  One of my first regulars would simply talk shop during the getting dressed phase. She was very much a 'natural', and offered a serious, intimate GFE. But after I emerged from the shower at the end, the illusion was over and we would have a short chat about business. Sometimes the focus was on her marketing and how I perceived the ads. She also quizzed me on the services of her competitors and colleagues. We also did some 'post match' analysis which was great fun. Like 'did you like the thing I did pouring the lotion?', or 'did you like that position, I have been working on it and think it gives a great visual?'. She revealed that what she was doing was theatre. Clients love the idea of knowing the 'real you' and she let me in on the 'secret' that she was a businesswoman. The message was that we had chemistry, but she worked hard for that chemistry, and she would like more clients with a similar chemistry. Not many people can switch it on and off to that level though. This individual is now retired and runs her own agency."

I fell in love with one of them because she basically told me that she wasn't acting and actually wanted to get to know me. It helped that I think shes the most beautiful girl in the world too. She also spent time with me otc. Turns out she was doing that with multiple guys just to keep business flowing. ... so otc time and her telling me she wasn't acting made me think she was interested. She wasn't tho. ... so fml

She is a great person, and happens to be married.   My life is complicated enough, so it was best to quit cold turkey. She emailed me for a while, but I stopped responding. While cynically one would think that she would provide the same treatment as nice to all her clients, but the degree and intensity of the shared intimacy was off the charts. I still really adore her, and am tempted to reach out when I'm blue.   The only drawback is that sadly now all others seem bland. Sometimes, we make connections that aren't meant to be. May be in time, I can look back on it as a silly crush or just a fantasy of wishing for a true connection. Oh well.    Edit: verbiage"

Hookers,2d9ozz,malibijones,3,Tue Aug 12 03:03:11 2014 UTC,"Just to add to whats already been said (cos the most important ones have been covered)   -Have one person in your life that knows what you do, someone you can talk to about your work when you've had a shitty day, or need to go to the Dr cos something NQR, and someone you can report too.   -Never let your guard down. I knew a girl who is 'industry famous' here in Aus, last year she had a 'light' s&m booking, a booking she'd taken a few times before over about 3 months. The guy was apparently having  ""a bad day""  He beat the life out of her, broke bone and left her there. (he was arrested and charged) But its a lesson girls can forget, no matter how many times you see them, no matter how nice they are, anyone can turn.   -Your body, your business. Track everything, who books, when, how long where they found you (will help you work out where you can save money in advertising later on if you're not getting a return)  But also your costs, how much does it really cost you to be 'hooker_you' from supplies, to fuel, clothes, etc (if your in a parlor your food on shift) that way your able to really see just how 'well' your doing. Cash in hand seems great until you work out you're probably not doing as well as you thought 'in the end'   -If a client offers you drugs or anything to drink, make sure you see them do it first, clients will spike drinks, so if they've opened the bottle make sure you see them drink it first. Drugs are the same too, if you 'party' with the client make sure your taking the same thing they are, cos one day one will try and slip something to you."

You will have your screening done for you, and the other staff is incredibly valuable to helping you get familiar with the industry. Trust your instincts.  If something feels off, leave Do not give discounts, spend extra free time with clients.  A good regular will appreciate that you are running a business, not a charity.  You dont want to keep clients coming back who expect free time.  Your time IS money now Dont work out of your home, or use your personal cell phone Get tested regularly Remember to take care of yourself, self care keeps you sanme in this line of work.

Think about a work-only laptop. Lock the phone with a strong password, keep it locked, and never leave it where someone can ""accidentally"" pick it up, look at it, pocket it, etc.   It's also good to have a trustworthy confidant who knows what you do and knows your schedule who you can check in with after appointments, to make sure you're OK. If this is someone in the same business you can do the same for him/her. BUT! be very sure that they are trustworthy; there are few enough of them in this world, let alone in this business."

Hookers,2d6xui,hookidayhooks,1 point,Mon Aug 11 01:06:28 2014 UTC,"To be honest this isn't a bad idea from a ""reliability"" stand point.  Meaning if you hire an escort who is willing \ enjoys this type of service (3 somes) you know exactly what you are getting.  She will most likely ""perform"" what you want (if discussed up front).  The only issue you may run into is the escort you refereed to may not offer 3 somes.  As for messing things up with your current provider that would be hard to do from a pure ""service stand point"".   Meaning if your significant other and the escort doesn't have chemistry... that shouldn't effect your service relationship with the escort.  Now if your significant other has an unpleasant confrontation with the Escort... that may or may not effect your relationship with said Escort."
Hookers,2d6xui,malibijones,1 point,Mon Aug 11 14:53:21 2014 UTC,"Not a bad idea at all.  I see tons of couples in similar situations.  Hiring an escort means you know exactly what you are getting, and dont have to worry about awkwardness resulting from finding a third who is already in your circle of friends.  Also, avoid the possible awkwardness of proposing a stranger.  Lots of escorts specialize in couples :)  Rates vary, but usually expect to pay double what you would for a regular appointment."

Hookers,2d310b,wankerwanker11,2,Sat Aug 9 17:51:38 2014 UTC,"I really don't think that the internet is 'shaking up' prostitution as much as is claimed. The real transformation came in the early 20th century. The reason that escorts are sometimes referred to as 'call girls' is that specialist magazines, cards in phoneboxes and restrooms, and even major daily newspapers carried ads.  The move to the internet actually hit a lot of newspapers, particularly the 'alternative press'. Backpage was literally the online offshoot of the classified ad sales department of the Village Voice. The Village Voice likes to highlight that it divested itself from Backpage, but the truth of the matter is that the longtime shareholders of the Voice sold the newspaper while retaining ownership of Backpage.  And even before the telephone, indoor prostitution was far larger than people realise. We know a lot about outdoor prostitution in the past from the records and writings of churches and charitable organisations. But there has always been indoor prostitution. And not just brothels or Parisian 'salons'. From girls working in taverns, to those that worked the theatre lobbies of Victorian London, to modern hotel girls, as seen in Vegas, Singapore and every Eastern European city."
