Roleplay,3dxko3,princesslecter,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:52:35 2015 UTC,"Hello! I'm definitely interested in RPing with you. I'm a big fan of Game of Thrones and a pretty experienced role player. I'm interested in what type of storyline you'd like to pursue. Also, are you okay with a female playing a male character? I'm a girl, but I have no problem role playing as male characters. I'd be very interested in RPing as Viserys btw. He's always been a favorite of mine. Anyway, I'd love to hear from you!"
Roleplay,3dwpn8,ToesOfDoom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:07:32 2015 UTC,Just to get this straight: You set up subreddits for the sole purpose of advertising and everything else is done through IRC?
Roleplay,3dwpn8,elphieisfae,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:50:49 2015 UTC,"No not at all! The RP subreddit is for writing anywhere in our game setting, but I also wanted to offer players the opportunity to also do chat-based rp. In which case, we have channels set up on IRC on the darkmyst server. Such rp is limited, however, to Bartertown and two establishments within it. Basically, the game offers both forum writing on the subreddit as well as chat-based roleplay on IRC.   Thanks for asking! And sorry if it wasn't made clear in the post. :)"

Roleplay,3dv25d,elphabaisfae,2,Sun Jul 19 19:24:30 2015 UTC,"An interesting concept, but how is this going to work? Are people going to have to regularly create new characters when their own get slaughtered in the games? Not sure I'd really like to put a lot of effort into crating a character only to have them butchered"
Roleplay,3dv25d,AerialMarauder,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:46:32 2015 UTC,"Games may only be held 1-2x a year. It's a good thought (as I don't usually kill my characters), but it is part of the.. thing. To change the games so people don't die opens up an entire new can of worms: are they eligible again? How do they live? are they allowed to live in their district or shunned?  etc, etc etc.  For now: it's the Hunger Games with all the entrappings you think are there, which does possibly include death.  of course, you could always make a character over 18, so they can't be reaped."
