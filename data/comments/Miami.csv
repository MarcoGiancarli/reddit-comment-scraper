Miami,3e11b0,Dirtydirtysouth305,2,Tue Jul 21 18:04:59 2015 UTC,That dam bridge. It is crazy how far inland the Miami River port goes with random cargo ships carrying everything from loads of bikes to used/probably some stolen cars. And those ships are not small that fit in the river and the bridges with the tug boats.   Used to have an office in downtown right on the river looking at it those ships were interesting.

Miami,3e2sfw,Miamiunnative,2,Tue Jul 21 18:08:53 2015 UTC,I think it's really good. The pool is on the roof though so if you need an indoor pool then this club wouldn't be good for you.

Miami,3e2sfw,steve70638,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:31:42 2015 UTC,"There is an indoor pool at the gym in Sunset Place. It's small though and I wouldn't recommend it since there are much better outdoor options (like the LA Fitness roof pool).   The golf clubs all have pools you can use, costs can be very high (Biltmore) to super reasonable (Coral Gables Athletic Club). AD Barnes park on Bird has a public pool which I've used a few times, but chlorine level is off the charts.   Best bet is UM pool, especially if you have any affiliation with the school. It's closed for upgrades for another month or so, but it's a great pool. I'm swimming there with a masters group once it opens again. Until then the pool at Coral Gables Athletic Club is a good alternative - only a couple of lanes roped off for laps, but rarely more than another person or two using them.   Good luck."

In no way was I ever able to afford more than the cheapest condo in a questionable neighborhood.  As soon as I moved to Florida, we bought a house in Broward in a nice area (quite a commute to Miami, but that wasn't a thought at the time as I wasn't working yet).  Not a cheap ranch either, a nice 4 br with a pool.  Qualified for it with what my wife was making at the time, and she was making about the same as I was in LA.  I don't recommend the commute for most people, but if you look in southern Broward I'm sure you can find something very nice for a fraction of what you'd find in most parts of Miami."

That first time you almost get side swipped because the person changing lanes didn't signal and just jolted into your lane. That first time someone gives you the finger. That first time someone lowers their window and tells you a few things that are on their mind. The first time you watching your rear view mirror as the guy behind you almost hits you because they are on the phone texting. That first time a luxury car (bmw, mercedes, or lexus) blocks your parking spot or intersection and could give three fucks about you. That first time you almost get t-boned because even though the perpendicular lane has the red light that doesn't mean stop to them.  It's a bit of hyperbole, you won't get these all in the same day.

Miami,3duf7o,kalilikins,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:46:57 2015 UTC,"Interesting stuff. Guess the driving culture is totally different. We regularly do small stuff like switching lanes where it's prohibited, not stopping at a STOP sign but only if we can clearly see we can go or as a pedestrian we cross the street wherever we want, which is also prohibited, but is considered a small crime and sometime seven the police doesn't care about it. But it's nowhere as near as what these guys pull off.  Especially that red car taking over the cam driver and going off the highway. That's insane.  We also usually go over the speed limit here, but only if it's safe to go, eg you can clearly see nothing will suddenly appear on the road or you won't have to stop quicky.  I'd go fast where the black car exceeded 15, you have 2m between the buses and your lane...  So summing it all up, most of the ""crimes"" in vid are common in all cities, the only dangerous thing is the quick switching between lanes at high speed, where you can't even see the cars which may join the traffic from the side of the road."

Miami,3dsa51,MG87,0,Mon Jul 20 01:59:27 2015 UTC,"I grew up in Miami and lived there most of my life until recent years.  You don't see this type of parking anywhere else in the nation.  Also, the backing into parking spots? Why? I don't understand it.  It takes extra time to sit there backing into spots. What's the purpose? Is it because it looks cool and you're showing off your cool car? I don't understand it.  An old friend from Miami I visited once outside Miami backed into a spot. His girlfriend was confused why he did that and realized she only saw that when she visited Miami with him. I understand it's easier to pull out of the spot in drive, but backing in to the spot initially takes much more time/effort than backing out.  What is it with Miami parking?"
Miami,3dsa51,random012345,3,Sun Jul 19 17:07:35 2015 UTC,"People back into spots all over the world, not just Miami.   It's easier for large cars and trucks to back into some spots and it makes it easier to pull out of the spot later on. If you're at a big event, like a concert or ball game, it's a good idea to back into the spot so you can make a quick exit."

Getting stuck in the middle of traffic with a blown tire because you paid Pepito $25 on the low low for ""like new"" tires will suck. Even worse will be if it causes an accident and you end up paying more in the long run. Get a good brand like GoodYear or Bridgestone.

Coolstuffgames has a store in Hollywood and they are one of the biggest MtG (and other TCG/tabletop game) merchants in the country. They have MtG events very regularly. There are a couple other really small places around like that NMB place you mentioned (which I could only stand going in there once cause it was so small) but those are the two I can think of in our area where they get a pretty big turn out.

Be sure to discuss coverage as they don't take all providers.   And best of luck. The best decision you've made is to seek out therapy. It's not easy getting by on your own with both depression and anxiety dragging you down.   I tell everyone seeking treatment to really give it a try and open up. It's not the easiest thing to do, but it helps them understand exactly what to address with you. Also if you find a therapist and you just don't feel like they're the one, it's perfectly okay to seek out someone else. Recovery is all about the journey. Best of luck."

Miami,3dn6rr,servo386,4,Fri Jul 17 23:12:23 2015 UTC,"I lived across from the Orange Bowl for 33 years. I hoped, but knew it wouldn't change anything. No one bothered to really study and understand that neighborhood. It's just a stepping stone to most people there. No real roots there. No one is truly invested. You either move out eventually or you just move from one eviction to the other - bouncing around. Whats the education level there? What kind of employment do most people who live there have experirnce in? Who votes? Who can vote? Who is a renter vs who is an owner? How many live in poverty? Who is undocumented? Who cant speak a word of english? The character and ethnic ""feel"" hasn't been the same since the late 80s. The city allows it to remain dirty. Does little about the vandalism, buildings that should be condemned, and public drunkenness.  Instead of parks and playgrounds it has a plethora of pawn shops and store front churches. No stadium was going to fix that.  PS: Bowl Bar is basically a brothel that disguises itself as a bar and whose clientele is mostly Central American working class men."

I live in little Havana and the stadium has done nothing but just cause traffic jams constantly and nothing really new has come from it. The same businesses and crappy strip malls are still here and crime seems to be the same. The cops that come only care about the stadium, not  surrounding area. Ugh, doesn't really matter to me who's paying for it, at the end of the day it's just gonna be another headache and no changes. Oo and more traffic jams of course.

Miami,3dn6rr,Nearpanic,5,Sat Jul 18 14:31:16 2015 UTC,I would be OK with a Metromover extension only because that area is extremely dense and already uses buses a lot. A Metromover extension could do a lot more for the area than a stadium.
Miami,3dn6rr,YeaISeddit,2,Sat Jul 18 08:04:46 2015 UTC,It would make more sense to just redo the leg of metrorail track between Culver and Civic Center by having it run south of the river along 7th with a new station around 12th Ave before heading back up towards Jackson. Maybe use the 7th & 17th station as a start point for metromover along 17th.  It was stupid they didn't build an Orange Bowl station from the very beginning.
Miami,3dn6rr,Pituquasi,2,Sat Jul 18 13:53:15 2015 UTC,"There's already a west facing platform at government center ready for a line down 2nd St. Take a look at government center on Google maps and you can easily see it. The platform is old enough that it would probably require retrofitting anyways so the track gauge makes no difference, Metromover or metrorail. Metromover is a lot cheaper to build, though, and makes more sense on such a short track. The distance is only slightly longer than the MIA peoplemover."
Miami,3dn6rr,YeaISeddit,2,Sat Jul 18 21:15:57 2015 UTC,"That platform is for the fabled East-West Metrorail line. It would be a shame if the used it for a half-assed stop-gap Metromover. The most ideal solution, ever better than what I suggested, is for that long promised line to be built. They could go elevated heavy rail out of GC, run parallel with the already county owned land along 836 (build a station at 17th that would serve the stadiums) and gradually drop elevation until it can merge with the at grade CSX line and continue on until dolphin, then turn south along the turnpike and end at FIU."

Miami,3diow8,agwe,-1,Thu Jul 16 16:16:17 2015 UTC,"Yea, I don't support this at all.   Miami fans will never go to MLS games, they don't even go to Marlins, Dolphins, or UM games.   For the city to give over land, nevermind help pay for the stadium, would be a huge waste of money."

Miami,3diow8,nomercyrule,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:14:25 2015 UTC,"We'll see what happens - the county wasn't supposed to get fucked over in the Marlins deal either but all of the sudden once you've agreed to give over the land it's in your 'interest' to get the thing built. UM isn't joining up with Beckham for funding so if there's a shortfall in private funding once construction's underway the city is going to have to look at selling bonds.   But funding aside I just think the idea that soccer can work in Miami is a joke. Look at the Marlins' attendance, it's the third worst in the MLB and Cubans historically LOVE baseball. Look at the attendance at the Orange Bowl for a national championship football team - they drew 31,000 for a game against Temple their 2001 championship season.   Filling a stadium for a single game against Brazil and Columbia doesn't reflect what an MLS team will pull anymore than filling a stadium for the Orange Bowl game reflects what UM will pull.   Miamians just don't go to sporting events unless it's a marquee nationally televised game - and that'll never be the case with MLS (which btw is a SUMMER league).   Miami had a MLS soccer team and they had to disband because of the embarrassing attendance. There's just no question in my mind that the same thing will happen to this team."
Miami,3diow8,agwe,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:26:32 2015 UTC,"miami had a mls team in name only, since they played at lockhart stadium in ft lauderdale.  i don't agree that there is any correlation between your cherry picked attendance stats and potential attendance for a different sport  i also don't agree with your assumptions, but you are entitled to your opinion. i look forward to getting season tickets myself"
Miami,3diow8,nomercyrule,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:36:18 2015 UTC,"Our MLB team is in the exact spot where they want to put a soccer stadium, and their attendance is third lowest in the league - there's nothing cherry picked about that stat.   I'm not making any assumptions about Miami sports fans, I've lived in Miami my whole life, and for every team but the Heat, who are now a marquee franchise who have won multiple titles in the second most popular sport in the US, Miami's attendance is horrible in all other sports, college and pro.   There's nothing wrong with that, all the typical excuses are true - it's too hot, it rains in the afternoon, and there's too much else going on.   But that's the reality. There are great dedicated fans that go to all of these teams' games and I'm sure there will some dedicated fans like yourself for soccer. Just not nearly enough to sustain a franchise."
Miami,3diow8,agwe,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:51:52 2015 UTC,"your stats are cherry picked in that they ignore other factors that would be inconvenient to your conclusion. you are saying the marlin's attendance is relevant because of the shared location. this suggests that location is the problem. this is ignoring the role that the marlin's ownership has played in turning the city against the team. cherry pick attendance stat, blame location factor, ignore ownership factor, etc.   our fans are just as good as any other city, it's just a frequently repeated stereotype that this is a bad sports town, reinforced by the typical excuses you listed. the dolphins are actually middle of the pack in the league in terms of attendance, the heat have been consistently near the top, the marlins just terrible and deservedly so, and the hurricanes historically had great attendance until they lost the orange bowl.   but you think a soccer team would be a joke, no way this city could support a team in a 25k seater because this is a bad sports city?  enough with the miami is a bad sports town stereotype already we get enough of that shit from the rest of the country."
Miami,3diow8,nomercyrule,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:43:50 2015 UTC,"I'm saying location isn't the problem, Marlins park is EXACTLY where the soccer stadium would go and Miamians don't go to the games. The NFL team plays 40 minutes away at Joe Robbie and their attendance is middle of the pack.   the hurricanes historically had great attendance until they lost the orange bowl.   This is just factually wrong, you're entitled to an opinion but the facts are what they are. UM has always had bad attendance, even in the Orange Bowl. Their 2001 championship season they averaged 47,162 fans. And that's no aberration, that's what they bring in year in and year out - it's actually gone UP since the move to Joe Robbie, albeit only about 2,000 fans more.  Like I said, there are great fans out there, I'm one of them, I have season tickets to UM, the Heat, and the Dolphins and if I can't make a game I make sure someone will be in my seats.   I don't take it personally when people point out that Miamians don't go to non-marquee games, because the numbers show that it's true and I'm not one of those fans.   But the numbers don't lie. And MLS soccer is not the NBA and is not the NFL, there's no chance Miamians are going to turn out for it. College football and MLB are way more popular and they won't turn out for those sports."
Miami,3diow8,agwe,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:59:51 2015 UTC,"let me put it this way:    2014 League Avg. Miami Avg.    NFL 67.6k 67.7k   NCAA D1 FBS 44.6k 52.5k   MLB 30.5k 19k   MLS 18.8k ???   NHL 17.5k 15.7k   NBA 17.4k 19.9k    Source and NCAA  Basically, I don't think you can look at the attendance of the Marlins and determine that there is ""no chance people will turn out"" for the MLS, ESPECIALLY if you're arguing ""location isn't the problem"" either. In fact, I don't think there is much if any correlation between the attendance of one sport and any other.   It looks to me like Beckham's team could flop with some mismanagement like the Marlins and Panthers, might be pretty average like the Dolphins, or be well-received like the Heat. I don't know why you're so eager to give them no chance at success and write them off before they've even been formally announced.   The fact that you've accepted Miami is somehow more of a bandwagon city than any other city doesn't really matter, but my opinion is that we are no more or less of a bandwagon city than the rest of the country aside from a few specific historical exceptions."
Miami,3diow8,nomercyrule,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:12:49 2015 UTC,"Florida Panthers averaged 11,265 last year, dead last in the league.   Using a mean value for college football makes no sense - Ohio State averaged 106,000 and Akron averaged 9,100. Why would anyone compare those schools? Miami is way behind nearly every program you would consider a 'major college football program', FSU and UF brought in 30,000 more fans per game than Miami. For the success they've had, even in the times when they were winning big, UM's attendance has been horrible compared to other major programs. And that's 100% a result of the non-marquee game attendance, Miami can pull in 70,000 against Notre Dame or UF or FSU any year.   The year before the Heat traded for Shaq they had the 6th lowest in attendance in the league. When the championship glow wore off and they had two down years in 2008 and 2009, they dropped to the middle of the league, despite having one of the top stars in the NBA.   I wouldn't call Miami a bandwagon city - any city in the country would turn out in droves for a team that's winning big. The difference is that most other cities in the country have fans that turn up in big or at least respectable numbers when the team isn't winning. And Miami doesn't have that, for any team besides the Dolphins.  The numbers don't lie - the attendance trends drop off rapidly after the NFL and only recently the NBA.   MLS is not the NFL or NBA, and Miami has never been able to pull respectable attendance for any other league."

I was in a McDonalds drive thru for over an hour with only like 3 cars. Pizza Hut same thing, I was the only customer and it took them about an hour and a half to make my pizza.  I definitely felt a culture shock in how laid back everyone was. It was like being in a town run by stoners at 4:20 o'clock. I want to clarify that they aren't DUMB slow, just laid back chillin' slow. They take their time with everything.  This was in Fairbanks. Make sure you hit up as many thrift stores as you can, they have a lot of cool shit.    As for what to take from Miami... For yourself I would highly suggest getting a pair or two of thermal pants. They are like pajamas you wear under your clothes. It will help with the cold weather.  For your friend, take pastelitos de guyaba (I take them as carry on). Just pick up a fresh batch on your way to the airport and have them tape the box extra. Like close off every open space instead of just the 3 strips they put. Have them effectively seal them in. This will make them last longer.  People up north go fucking bonkers for pastelitos."

There's a sign at the entrance to Krome from US27 that shows how many fatal accidents there have been that year. It's 3 so far in 2015 in case you're wondering. I was there once when someone crashed fatally, they landed a helicopter in the middle of Krome to pick them up but they died anyways.

Doesn't matter if it's middle of the day or 3 am, shit can ALWAYS happen, even on those backroads in the Everglades. A friend of mine was driving like an asshole in the middle of the night out there and swerved to dodge a gator.

The roads in the Everglades while fun are not exactly places to open a car like that up.   If you want to drive fast, I-75, Turnpike are the way to go. For a quick straight away I-195 is a good option. Not too many cops there if you want to go a bit over the speed limit.   The good thing about much of the turnpike and I-75 the limit is 70mph so going even 90mph is not a possible wreckless ticket.

Miami,3d9nyn,JustAnotherImmigrant,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:44:08 2015 UTC,I've been an ATT broadband customer for over 15 years. I've had great service from ATT and my only complaint is that DSL's upload speed is absolute shit.  Will this new service have better upload speeds or will it continue to be an unbalanced down/up ratio?  Currently I'm on their 45/6 plan and I was interested in streaming and would like a bit more upstream bandwidth since it ends up bogging down the internet for everyone else even when I stream at low bit rates.
Miami,3d9nyn,zewm426,6,Wed Jul 15 13:32:29 2015 UTC,"All I can say about this is that yes, it's expensive, but I'm still happy to see ISPs experimenting with rolling out FTTH.  Right now in most places if you want decent Internet you have to choose between a kludge (DSL) and a kludge (Cable modems). Both are ways of moving data over networks not originally intended to move data. Both are stopgap measures.

Google has more resources than most countries and yet they have installed just a handful of small cities in the years they have been laying fiber. Telecom infrastructure is extremely expensive to install, and very time consuming.   Even with an influx of service providers (which would still be tiny), the odds of you having more choice are still nill. What may happen is a supply and demand push for providers as a whole to have better internet available, but that wont affect what they charge and who they provide it to.

Just for reference, gigabit internet at NAP of the americas is about $1,300 a month, JUST for the internet. 2 gigabit at the house for $300 is a steal. I can already picture some small businesses that actually need that speed and have their house relatively close to the business setting up a ubnt air fiber system and just host everything in house.  Then again, assuming it's reliable. If it's fiber to the curb and they have half decent peering agreements, it SHOULD be. Yes google fiber will be cheaper.

Better than los verdes and all that.  Shilla/sushi cafe , next to mall of the Americas. Great Korean.  Silver palace in west Kendall. Good Chinese.  Casa Marin on 97th and coral way. Good and cheap Cuban food.  I'll still go to bat for Versailles bakery (not so much the restaurant) and say they have THE best ham croquetas in all of Miami. When they're freshly made... My god.

If I'd flipped through all the other stations and nothing caught my interest, I could count on it to at least have something listenable on.  Over the years, it's really grown on me.  It's gotten to the point where I just leave my radio tuned to CSF all the time.  It's no longer just background music.  There are specific composers and pieces that I like.  I've even got classical music on my phone now.  And while I'll still have plenty of options for classical music -- CSF's core programming should be available from any station that syndicates the Classical 24  feed, and /r/classicalresources has a cornucopia of composer-specific recommendations and Spotify playlists -- it makes me sad that others in the area will no longer have the opportunity to fall in love with classical music the way I did."

Miami,3d4gdp,digitall565,6,Mon Jul 13 18:06:35 2015 UTC,"It's not popular anywhere, but compared to other places South Florida is probably above average in classical listening due to our retirees.   There's actually a decent ""classical"" scene. The Cleveland Orchestra does their winter residency in Miami and they're one of the best orchestras in the world. The New World Symphony is not very good, but the Wallcast is a pretty unique experience. There are also the Florida Grand Opera, Miami City Ballet, Miami Cuban Ballet, who all perform classical pieces. Also UM has a great music program although it is not really focused on classical. The Arscht Center has hosted basically every traveling orchestra.   Aside from New York, LA, and probably Boston I doubt any other cities in the US have a greater demand and access for orchestral and chamber music than South Florida."

Miami,3d22c1,freediverx01,-16,Mon Jul 13 01:12:19 2015 UTC,"Why do people even want to protect the Everglades? It's nothing but an alligator and mosquito filled swamp wasteland.   It's not a beautiful national park with large beautiful trees and hiking trails. It's a deathtrap.  If it was up to me, Naples and Miami would all be one big city.   I know I will be down voted to hell, but no one will give me a better answer than ""protect the environment derr derr"". The sooner we can get rid of this huge piece of useless land, the better. I'm not for drilling oil out of it, but I am against saving mosquitoes and alligators."
Miami,3d22c1,apinc,6,Mon Jul 13 11:53:04 2015 UTC,"I hunt and fish the everglades often. It's a beautiful place where you can truly get away from man.  The potential destruction of drilling there would effect millions of non human lives (not just gators and skeeters). That's why it shouldn't be allowed.  If a spill occurred, it would be impossible to clean up."
Miami,3d22c1,SpanishSurfer,-4,Mon Jul 13 14:34:02 2015 UTC,I think you and I have different definitions of beautiful.  This is not beautiful in any way.  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Everglades_Alligator-babies.jpg  http://images.nationalgeographic.com/wpf/media-live/photos/000/020/cache/everglades-inlets_2026_600x450.jpg  http://www.growntravel.com/usa/bm~pix/morning-everglades-tour2.jpg
Miami,3d22c1,apinc,2,Mon Jul 13 14:44:56 2015 UTC,"Let me get this straight, I mention life experiences I've had in this area and tell you it's a beautiful place and your rebuttal are 3 links to some photos with gators?  Please don't comment on this subject anymore, adults are trying to have a conversation."
Miami,3d22c1,SpanishSurfer,-1,Mon Jul 13 22:45:13 2015 UTC,"I still haven't heard anything but ""duurr duuurr environment"".  I say humans need the land more than some ""wildlife"" does. Interestingly enough your memories of the everglades are actually killing said wildlife.  So it's ok if you ""hunt and fish"" killing the local wildlife, but if someone else does it and provides an actual benefit (more usable land), it's not fine?   Beautiful place and life memories? You know what else is a beautiful place with life memories, a house. A neighborhood.   If one day I ever decide to run for office, you can be damn sure I'll sell off whatever land I can to developers."
Miami,3d22c1,apinc,3,Tue Jul 14 00:47:32 2015 UTC,"Your attitude is the reason we have major worldwide problems like climate change. It's also irresponsible and extremely ignorant. Let me spoon feed you some science to shut you up.   ¬†  Do you realize the Everglades is a massive sanctuary to millions of birds and fish. Those fish are a food source for humanity, a MAJOR one. If you were to wipe out the Everglades, you would wipe out a major food source, which would inevitable devastate the local fishing economy and drive the cost of fish up, nationwide. Not to mention that a loss of habitat in the Everglades would result in massive devastation to any cities that you build in it or around it. It is a tidal swamp after all. It also acts as a shock absorber when hurricanes or major storms hit the South Fla region, you can research this on the South Florida Water Management's website if you'd like. So with your plan, you wipe out millions of wildlife, ruin the fishing economy in S. FLA, and cause massive flooding problems with a potential of a disaster greater then what happened during Hurricane Katrina. All so you can live in a concrete jungle where people are overcrowded, starring at cell phones while driving on the highway, and hell bent on destroying the beautiful world we live in.  Honestly, your attitude makes me sick. It's the reason we have hundreds of world wide problems, the major one being climate change. What people like you haven't realized, is that we're still on the food chain.  We may be at the top but when you start destroying the base layers the entire system crashes down, and the ones at the top fall the hardest."
Miami,3d22c1,SpanishSurfer,3,Tue Jul 14 01:30:51 2015 UTC,"It's our water source, recharges the Biscayne aquifer. Important to keep it clean and contaminant free."
Miami,3d22c1,canvaswater,3,Mon Jul 13 16:05:39 2015 UTC,"I can't believe people actually think this way.  Nature doesn't owe us anything.  It does not need to be ""beautiful"" or provide us with leisure areas in order to be worth saving.    (but, fwiw, the Everglades do give us plenty of benefit: Florida gets 1/6th of its water from the Everglades.  Do you want to turn us into California?)"
Miami,3d22c1,RoseOfSharonCassidy,-5,Mon Jul 13 16:15:06 2015 UTC,"I find it hard to believe there isn't a way to condense all this water into one place, much smaller than the Everglades. Why can't you dam it?  Nature doesn't owe us anything. But we do owe it to ourselves to save our own species. I don't give a fuck about any of the wildlife or plant life there. The sooner we pour fumigated concrete over it and turn it into much needed real estate, the better. Mosquitoes and alligators are not providing any benefit. In fact, they are actively engaged in warfare against us. It boggles my mind that you actually want to save mosquitoes."

Miami,3d22c1,SpanishSurfer,0,Tue Jul 14 01:34:10 2015 UTC,"No one says COMPRESS water. I said condense.  one source says there is about 1 trillion gallons of water in the everglades  http://www.evergladesfoundation.org/breaking-news/basins-would-help-clean-water/  While I think that number is very low, I don't see why we can't just reroute all that water into a dam, and it'll be MUCH MUCH smaller than the everglades, and MUCH more accessible. We could even get great hydroelectric power out of it."
Miami,3d22c1,apinc,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:05:02 2015 UTC,"LOL, that article you posted literally talks about taking over water reservoirs originally used for farmers in an effort to clean up the pollution problems humans have created from damming up Lake Okeechobee. A problem that wasn't a problem in the Everglades before we leveed the shit out of it and the big lake.   Read the last paragraph:   The only way to store water naturally is to keep it on the landscape in wetland systems. South Florida‚Äôs ecology balanced itself before lands were artificially drained for development. Now water flows too fast to the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean, sending pollution to both coasts at whitewater rates.   Go ahead and mow over the Everglades and put concrete down, you'll see how much freshwater you have left."

When I was 16 my grandfather used to take me to empty places (parking lots, dirt roads, etc) and would teach me / let me drive around.  Save your $$ and just get someone familiar to you with a vehicle to give you some time behind the wheel.    That being said, they just about hand out licenses in cereal boxes these days. You won't have any problems as long as you have a smidgen of common sense."
Miami,3d1qeu,IMREALWHAT_R_U,5,Sun Jul 12 20:29:59 2015 UTC,Wynood is like the borderline of the hood. Some people would not go anywhere north of 25th. It really depends. I wouldn't go anything north of like 65th. 25 mins to doral really depends on the traffic. You can be there in 15 mins or an hr depending on the time of day.
Miami,3d1qeu,MEAN_MUG_SHOT,2,Sun Jul 12 21:01:18 2015 UTC,"Exactly this regarding traffic. It can take me 25 minutes from the airport area to get to Doral in heavy traffic, or it can take me 10. It depends entirely on the time of day."
Miami,3d1qeu,SugarPlatypus,2,Sun Jul 12 21:30:46 2015 UTC,"There really aren't too many places to live in Wynwood proper. You can move to Midtown or Edgewater but unless you're in that building next to Pride and Joy or in one of those houses in between Miami Ave and NW 2nd, I don't really know where you'd move to.  I've lived and worked in this area for a long time and yes, I would consider it safe, assuming you live in an apartment building. Living in a house with direct access to the street could get questionable quickly but it would depend on exactly where it is.  Traffic to and from downtown isn't terrible - you'd be going against traffic. Most of the traffic you'll encounter will be when you get off in Doral.  I love Wynwood, most people I know love Wynwood, it's a big loud hipster neighborhood with lots of bars and an increasingly good quality of life. If you're in it for the social scene, you'll enjoy it.  It's hard to not notice you're on the edge of some really bad neighborhoods when you're anywhere in Downtown Miami. How safe you feel really has to do with how far from the more populated streets you venture. It's not suburb safe but any ounce of street smarts should keep you out of the shadier parts. For what it's worth, I don't personally know anyone who's gotten mugged in Wynwood.  25 is a decent average, but traffic is fickle here, like the other comments mentioned."
Miami,3d1qeu,miseducation,2,Sun Jul 12 22:49:46 2015 UTC,"It looks kinda shady at night where the houses are tbh. But i come from a big unsecure city and i walked it no probs many times when nobody was there. Like during the week for example. I wouldn't move there because i see it as a party only place, like you'd have to live with the noise every weekend. Depends of the kind of person you are.  My aunt lives in Miami Shores and goes to Doral every day, i think it takes her half an hour depending on traffic. Google maps should be very accurate if you check it at the time you'd be driving there."
Miami,3d1qeu,Bendix,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:39:41 2015 UTC,"1) Yes, I live on 25th and 2 ave.. totally safe imo. 2) I used to work by FIU and there wasn't much traffic. Traffic is usually flowing toward downtown from the south. 3) refer to 2 4) Day I feel safe, night too but not AS safe as day. Just don't put yourself in dumb situations 5) Thats about right, Wynwood to Doral in the morning would have very minimal traffic in the morning since everyone is going the opposite way. 6) YES! There is one near biscayne and 18th https://www.facebook.com/pages/Gym-by-Diego-Buendia/146928962027618 . They don't do any marketing so I didn't find it till a few months living there."
Miami,3d1qeu,chris_brownie,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:55:17 2015 UTC,"1.) Yes and no. Personally, I would stay South of 29th street. I have had friends live North of there for 2 years without problems except for last year.   / 5.) Not sure because I do not take the 112. Traffic just blows in Miami in general. You may be lucky and commute opposite flow. I would check waze out one morning and see what your commute to Doral would be.   3.) IMO, no. You're coming from the arts district so you'll appreciate the art movement there like the art walk every month. There are a lot of new apartment buildings scheduled to be finished in 2016 smack dab in the middle of all the action like the one on 24nd and 2nd behind panther coffee, and some nice ones already established outside the arts district - basically further South in the more gentrified area.  I would suggest living East of N. Miami Ave and South of 22nd. You would be on the edge of the art district and Gentrification.   4.) As a 6'5"" male there with friends I feel safe, but might not necessarily be safe. Lots of Cops there at night making a presence, but it can happen anywhere. I was pissed about this because I love the nightlife in Wynwood and this happened in a very busy night life area. At night, I've had wheels off bikes (and whatever the lock could not secure)stolen by little hoodlums right outside Gramps and BOXELDR.  5.) See 2.  6.) Yes, there has to be one around. Especially if you live in a nice new apartment building. I do see a bunch of crossfit places on my way to the Wynwood Building. They make sure you see them. They even open up their warehouse doors so you can specifically see how hard they are working. Sometimes they will even run out into the street with weights, because frogger is an essential part of cross-training."
Miami,3d0po4,Jenitalia42,2,Sun Jul 12 15:18:24 2015 UTC,"Epilepsy patient here.  Suffer from grand mal  type seizures which have effectively been controlled with Dilantin for 4 years now. Tried several types if medicines until finally coming to Dilantin as the best drug of choice.  Just changed over to Keppra type drug due to liver damage and noncontrollable loss of ability of keeping a therapeutic level on Dilantin. New drug offers a good choice for me because of the other side effects of gum issues and confusion/memory loss.  Reason I say all this is my first neuro was too worried about the side effects of the drugs that we couldn't get it right. My new neuro is a new school of thought and said do Dilantin because I know it works but the side effects suck. Once leveled out and seizure free, we could worry about side effects. Asked about Webb, but neuro wasn't keen to it because of the lack of true trials."

Miami,3d0po4,Nemohoes7,-1,Sun Jul 12 22:33:54 2015 UTC,"People, including doctors, should not be giving medical advice on the internet.   While CBD is legal in Florida, all claims of reducing frequency of seizures are anecdotal. There has been no scientific conclusion based on actual patient trials that have shown benefits, and there is concern that there may even be harmful effects.  In general, people tend to think that medications, including marijuana or CBD oils, are a cure-all for all afflictions, but we need to realize that every intervention or chemical that we introduce into our bodies has a unique effect based on the biology of the patient, and also, the potential for ""side effects."" Anti-epileptic drugs are notorious for causing side effects.  At the end of the day, your SO is definitely entitled to seek out second opinions. Unfortunately, I cannot give you the names of any specific neurologists, but you may try contacting your local hospitals or search online."

Wynwood is a great example of an area which the cost of living is affecting communities of people who were there before gentrification took effect, you can't expect communities to grow when their economic situation is stagnant and falling by simpling allowing foreign business entities to come in spew some bullshit about how ""blah blah with help the local economy"". All local municipalities in the United States are corrupt to the core because of the way business can use it's money as leverage to do what it wants to do which is turn a profit meanwhile people who have no kind of leverage other than to vote have no choice in the matter yet they live the reality.

Miami,3ctpzn,Managerial_cow23,3,Fri Jul 10 18:22:51 2015 UTC,"NOLA is not all that similar to Miami.  Miami is mostly Hispanic, and there's not much of that at all in New Orleans.  Haiti isn't Hispanic, and anyway its influence in New Orleans is very distant.  There's a Haitian community in Miami, but it's totally for real and not like New Orleans, either.  Miami is a pretty new city, and doesn't really have the history that New Orleans has.  It's also a lot richer than New Orleans, and doesn't value old things as much, so they tend to get demolished in favor of new things.  It's a whole lot cleaner, safer, and better organized than New Orleans. In Coral Gables, and other similar areas, it's comparable to Boca (except for being quite Hispanic).  It's also not as spotty as New Orleans; from Coral Gables, any truly bad neighborhood is not in walking distance, which is never true in NOLA.  The less affluent working-class neighborhoods are also very safe.  Still, it's not Mayberry; lock your car.  Further from the city center and to the West, it gets sprawly; think Kenner.  It's a big city, and people are more withdrawn, though that should be less of a problem if you're meeting people in school.  Spanish would be very helpful most anywhere in the area.  Summers are hot and muggy, not unlike Louisiana, but the winters are much warmer and more pleasant.  In the winter, it'll be a bit warmer than Tampa.  From Coral Gables High School, you can walk a couple of blocks to the free Coral Gables Trolley that runs north-south on Ponce de Leon road.  You can connect to the free City of Miami trolley at Miracle Mile/Coral Way, which will get you downtown.  Taking the Coral Gables trolley in the other direction will get you to the Metrorail, and from there the connecting bus system, which gives you more options.  It's not free, but there's a discounted pass available for students."

Miami,3cogt8,SPER,4,Thu Jul 9 14:24:33 2015 UTC,"I moved to North Shore in December and quite frankly, I love it. You mention it being far from everything, but it really depends on where you go.  For me, I'm close to nearly everywhere I have to go. I go to FIU BBC and my commute is only 20 minutes. I work in South Beach and my commute is 10-15 minutes. It also only takes me about 15 minutes to get to Wynwood/Midtown. Aventura mall is also only 20 or so minutes away as well. Even then, Coral Gables and such is only 20-30 minutes.  There are also several ways to get out of North Shore into the mainland that make going in and out not much of a hassle (63, 71, 96 and 163).  The atmosphere in this part of the beach is much more relaxed and there a lots of community events too. It's very walkable and the free trolley makes it even  more accessible. Restaurants are good and not so expensive and the beach isn't crazy like South Beach.  Just try to find a place that includes parking because if not, you might go a bit crazy haha."
Miami,3cogt8,guisasolaa,2,Thu Jul 9 21:52:10 2015 UTC,"I lived in North Beach for 3 years... moved away this past January. It's a great place to be if you value being close to the beach. Nothing beats going for a run or bike ride along the boardwalk and thinking ""this is my neighborhood."" The monthly food truck nights are great... and other events that are regularly held at North Shore Park add a great community feel. I think they also have outdoor movies at the band shell... never made it to one of those.  Area is definitely on the way up. New Publix is great on the inside (terrible parking/traffic), great local bars and restaurants, the free trolley is a great addition.  You're absolutely right, it's away from everything. Trips to chains like Chipotle or Target are unnecessarily difficult... the distance from 95 is obnoxious... most of my social life centered on Brickell/Grove/Gables which seems so far away. Access to South Beach is great though, even during busy events.  Again, I think the neighborhood is getting better as development on the mainland expands north into the Upper East Side area... and new condo plans will probably bring even more restaurants and retail."

Miami,3clm1k,premitive1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:02:55 2015 UTC,"What I wonder, is why does the medallion system exist in the first place? Why does it cost a quarter million dollars for someone to operate a cab?"
Miami,3clm1k,Brett4Life,2,Thu Jul 9 16:24:22 2015 UTC,"There are examples in various industries in which industry specialty organizations create barriers of entry to protect the profitability of the industry. In this case, the medallion system was installed to avoid having too many taxi cab drivers, which would force drivers to provide competitive, market based prices for their services. Rather, the medallion system induces a monopolistic situation, and further guarantees a minimum price for the service. The functional definition of a monopoly. While they set a price on the cost of Taxi service, the government did not balance this by ensuring equitable access to the medallion's granting access to the monopoly system. Instead, the county sells them at one price in a lottery system (which we will presume for expediency is not corrupted) and they can there after be sold and leased at market values. Many people and organizations owning medallions lease them to taxi drivers, who pay a per use fee. Every day requires a new fee. These can be upwards of $100 a day. That means a taxi driver must earn 100$ in profit before he can even pay for the shift he works.  What a system!"
Miami,3clm1k,premitive1,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:53:41 2015 UTC,Ready for the irony behind all of this? The cab companies are the ones who put the medallion system and all the high costs associated with getting a cab company started in order to prevent competition from moving in. Now they are bitching because Uber and Lyft dont have to play by the same rules and they are stuck with the shit they created. Boo fucking hoo.
Miami,3clm1k,ambientvape,2,Thu Jul 9 21:02:15 2015 UTC,"not so ironic granted most medallions are absentee owned. The owners of these medallions ONLY make money in the current system. A free market system or open competition system would immediately and tremendously devalue medallions, hurting their ability to rent them out to drivers. That's not ironic, but an active example of government protecting an otherwise unprofitable business model."

Miami,3ckklf,jama2250,17,Wed Jul 8 17:11:08 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. There are neighborhoods that only speak Spanish or Creole, no English.    In fact one could have a difficult time if they did not speak at least a little Spanish."
Miami,3ckklf,JustVern,11,Wed Jul 8 17:26:03 2015 UTC,"1.Do you visit restaurants where the employees speak Spanish?  All the time. Most restaurants have at least one or two employees that speak Spanish.  2.Can you handle civic or government issues in Spanish?  Not so sure about that one. What kind of civic or government issues? Like getting a driver's license and going to court? I mean, ultimately the answer must be yes, because (1) lots of people have driver's licenses who speak no English, and (2) there are always employees at the DMV and in courts, including judges, who speak Spanish. Finding an attorney who speaks Spanish or Portuguese would probably be easier than finding one that doesn't.  3.When you buy food, clothes, or other essentials, can you buy them in Spanish?  Absolutely. A lot of working-class people and employees speak Spanish. In fact, lots of wealthy South Americans come to Miami and the nearby cities while they're on vacation just to go shopping.  4.Are your friends and acquaintances Spanish-speaking?  Yes, some of them. Others speak Russian, Hebrew, Arabic, Ukrainian, Portuguese, and I know one dude who speaks Georgian. I even know people who only speak English. I don't live in Miami, though. I live in a city called North Miami Beach that's in a different part of Dade County.  5.Is it necessary for you to use translation apps?  For what? Why? For Facebook?  6.Do you interact with English-speaking people  Sure, of course.  7.When you are outside of your house, are you likely to deal with Spanish-speaking people?  Most of Miami is heavily suburbanized and somewhat desolate as a result, so when you walk outside, if you aren't in downtown or Wynwood, you're fairly likely not to interact with anyone at all. You could walk your dog around your neighborhood twenty times and only see one other person, and not talk to that person. But if you were to talk to that person, there's a fair chance that he or she would know a little bit of Spanish.  If you go to a store or a mall, you will hear large groups of Spanish-speaking people. There is a mall called Mall of the Americas, which is not in Miami but only a few blocks west of it; I went there once and everybody was speaking Spanish.   8.Is written materials available to you in Spanish?  Usually they is, wherever written materials are available in English.  9.When you receive medical attention or assistance, can this be done in Spanish?  Every single person in medical school is from Venezuela or Cuba. So yes.  10.If you drive, can you purchase your driving-related issues like registration, manage violations, or other issues in Spanish?  Wasn't that question 2? Your registration will probably be in English, but yes, when you get a ticket there are instructions are in English, Spanish, and Haitian Creole, and if you call them up there will be representatives who speak Spanish.  FYI, there is a city about ten miles northwest of Miami called Hialeah that is majority-Cuban. Hialeah is a de-facto Spanish-speaking city. There are a lot of people in Hialeah who don't speak English, so if you get lost there you won't be able to ask for directions. Some people think Hialeah is in Miami but it isn't, it's a different city."

Miami,3cmf8e,Flymia,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:49:58 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify, the broker fee is worked into the listing price. All listings in Miami Beach are first month, last month, and deposit upfront... so, effectively 3 months. In my experience, the deposit goes to the broker as their fee.   If I knew how to find the property manager for a listing, contacting them and taking out the middle man would be easy, but they are not listed on the MLS listings. That is the challenge.   Also, even if I knew the property management company, I am not sure if they would interact directly with a private party. Does anyone have direct experience with this?"
Miami,3cmf8e,Flymia,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:50:10 2015 UTC,You should not be paying any money to the broker. The deposit you should get back assuming there are no claims when you move out.

Miami,3cmf8e,premitive1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:13:34 2015 UTC,"the way I understand it is the broker gets a % of the rent you pay to the landlord. if you sign a 12 month lease for 1900 a month, the broker gets 2280 (from the landlord).  the interesting thing is if you renew your lease the next year, the broker also gets a piece of that, without lifting a finger.  as far as your question goes, I haven't tried renting in North Miami Beach, but in Brickell and Coconut Grove you can't really escape it unless you use Craigslist. Even then you may end up getting a broker.  They kind of use ""used car salesman"" tactics- driving around or looking online you may find an apartment advertised for rent. When you call, you get a broker who tells you ""Sorry, that apartment just got rented"" (that poster or ad will never come down, however) They will then try to sell you a bunch of other properties using their brokerage service. You will have a hard time reaching an owner or landlord, unless you look at efficiencies or cottages in somebodies back yard."

My friend lives in unincorporated Dade but his block is surrounded on all sides by North Miami Beach.

I know that a lot of Jewish people live in the unincorporated enclave around 10th Avenue.  I'm actually pretty surprised only two percent of North Miami Beach is white. I'm guessing they're all in Skylake. I know a lot of Haitians, but maybe second generations are counted as Americans?

Miami,3cg62r,PurpleSashimi,3,Tue Jul 7 17:34:26 2015 UTC,"One interesting aspect of Miami Museum's is that many are privately funded, or founded based on the wishes of one donor to house their own collection. This ends up decentralizing Miami's art, and in my opinion lowering the quality. Perez is a cool museum for sure with some neat stuff, but I have also see some really bad exhibits there. (Did anyone see the ""garbage"" exhibit a few months back??). That being said, the main art museums are probably: Bass, Perez, Wolfsonian, Museum of Contemporary Art, Lowe, and Frost (in no particular order). You could also take the 4 hour drive to the Dali Museum in St. Petersburg."
Miami,3cg62r,Brett4Life,3,Tue Jul 7 19:48:42 2015 UTC,I personally enjoyed the Miami History museum... I went just a few months ago with somewhat low expectations and left very pleased. I've also heard the Frost museum is good but I haven't had the chance to go myself.

There is security on the trains here and there and at the stations. I would say its not more dangerous than walking. Its pretty safe. Maybe you might want to avoid it at say after 10-11pm but any time before that its will have at least a few people per car."

I also used to take the same trip (from home to work ofc) at 6:30a.  In the several years that I frequented the mover/rail I only ran into one problematic person. It nearly came to fisticuffs but nothing happened. Just some dirty looks and shit talking.  I would surmise that it's fine. I would only worry about the cut off time if you plan to spend the night drinking. Don't forget by midnight you're cutting it close.

Miami,3ceswf,JumpinJaysus,26,Tue Jul 7 10:23:48 2015 UTC,"Living here can suck, a lot. Visiting can be awesome. Both depend on how much money you make, or how much you do your research. There is a lot to do and see for a tourist, but some of the places that are famous locales can be underwhelming.   Definitely rent a car.  Definitely visit the National, State, and even some of the local parks. We have some great parks.  Definitely visit South Beach (it's fake!).  Visit Crandon Park and Bill Baggs Beaches (not fake).  Definitely check out Wynwood's walls and bars.  Catch $2 bets, beer, and hot dogs Sundays at Miami Jai-a-lai.  Go to the Everglades Main Entrance. Stop at Robert is Here, maybe Schnebly's.  Can you afford to charter an offshore fishing day?  Go to the keys and book a scuba/snorkel trip.  Rent a jet ski, paddle board, kayak, or wind-surf board on the bay or in the keys.  Go window shopping in Bal Harbour or the Design District.  The new Art museum is pretty cool, and the History Miami museum is small but usually interesting.  Check for great restaurants, there are some winners at all price ranges.   We tend to bulldoze our history here, but Venetian Pool, Pincrest Park (formerly Parrot Jungle), Monkey Jungle, and Coral Castle all survive. And Miami Shores still has neon festooned motels and the Coppertone Girl.  TL;DR: do some homework. Miami is a huge tourist draw for a reason. Locals shit all over the place for local reasons like political mismanagement and corruption, high cost of living, poor serviced-based employment opportunities, as well as lingering race issues. It's the same as any Banana Republic in a beautiful place; humans try to ruin it."

Stuff that makes you look around and think ""What?!""  Amelia Earhart took off on her final flight at OpaLocka Airport (Earhart Field). For maybe the first half of the 20th Century, Miami had the most airfields in the world.  The Lighthouse on Key Biscayne was attacked by Seminoles and they burned it. The light was out for a decade. Crandon Park was also the original location for the Zoo.  Dadeland mall 1. Used to have a liquor store and 2. got shot up by drug hitmen in broad daylight in the middle of the busy mall.  There's a quiet street in a south Miami suburb that was the location of an intense shootout between FBI agents and armored bank robbers. Consequently, the FBI replaced standard issue revolvers with semi-automatics.  Glenn Curtiss liked to make both groundbreaking airplanes and themed neighborhoods. That's how we got Opa-Locka... And arabesque architecture.  Eastern AirLines Flight 401.  Coral Castle.  Seriously weird stuff. A tourist dream."

I like to get about when I travel and am interested in local history, quirky places and odd spots so I'll be sure to check out some of these spots. Thanks again."
Miami,3ceswf,aCause4Concern,4,Tue Jul 7 15:20:32 2015 UTC,"the airfield stuff is interesting    Miami is one of the most aviation history rich areas of the world. Eastern Airlines and Eddie Rickenbacker, Pan Am flying boats out of the Diner Key Terminal which is still standing and is now city hall. Many areas used to be old military bases for aircraft during WWII. You will often see a DC-3 or Convair 580 flying overhead and even the 727 is still a daily sight at MIA. Its a great aviation town.   A good place to start with the local history honestly is wikipedia. There are a decent amount of walking tours in the older more historical areas like Miami Beach, Downtown Miami, Little Havana. Be sure to check out the Biltmore Hotel. And a few days in the Keys is a really good idea. If you like History at all, Key West has TONS of it."

If you're from a place that's landlocked and don't get to the beach much it would be an awesome time.   My favorite thing about South Florida is the Florida Keys. If you're renting a car might as well go to done of the state parks in the keys. Kayaking, fishing, snorkeling and camping if you book early enough. Great key lime pie and charter fishing all around.  Miami has a lot of shopping.  I mean there is a ton of overpriced shit. Rent a jet ski, go top the beach, take a tour.   Not much history here but plenty of debauchery. If you're a drinker you'll love it. Oh and if you're a smoker 20 grams or less well only get you a $100 ticket."

I think you are over doing it just a little bit by being here 2 weeks.  The beaches are fun but there is just so much time you can spend on the sands.  Miami isn't the touristy, lets go look at historical things kinda place but more of a place to party drink and fall asleep at the beach.   You might want to consider an alternative.  Maybe swing by Orlando and check out the theme parks for a few days then finish off in Miami to relax at the beach. but I think 2 weeks here is way to long... Just a thought..."

For exotic meats you can check out Marky's which coincidentally is on 79th st as well. It not a butcher shop but a gourmet market so It'll be frozen but you can find most anything there.

Miami,3cbv3p,hohumbug,6,Mon Jul 6 18:26:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not certain, but I suspect $1000 a month for near the Rail station would be a pipe dream.  Best thing to probably do, is see if HR can get you information about neighborhoods where your coworkers live. Pretty sure it would be ok for them to say something like many people live in the Miami Lakes region or something like that.   Living in cheaper Broward and commuting to Dade is not uncommon and with your budget, and a central location to the Rail station, that might be your smartest option til your budget increases. Fort Lauderdale is full of bars and restaurant areas with a lot of non-Spanish speaking tourist to mingle with. Of course a lot of people here do know some English, so as a non-speaker, trust me when I tell you, you'll survive. Fort Lauderdale also has numerous places to hop a bus to get you to Dade.  I could hop a bus in Hollywood to where I think you are trying to get to that took about an hour each way and cost like $1.25 each way. Wasn't the worst reason to listen to music and read a book."
Miami,3cbv3p,icancut,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:42:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. The more I look, the more I am realizing that my budget is very limiting in Miami.   Do you think that it might be worthwhile to look in some of the cheaper neighborhoods in Miami?"
Miami,3cbv3p,icancut,2,Tue Jul 7 19:18:55 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, dear god no. Others might disagree with me, but I find the divide between the haves and have nots rather extreme in the central parts of Miami and that dollar saved might put you very near crack dealer central. You're not going to get the atmosphere you can probably get in Broward for the same $.  West Miami, I like. It's cheaper, but there's seriously less to do here. It doesn't have the vibrancy you are looking for. Traffic sucks except for the hours of 8-midnight seemingly."

The train has only one line, but it goes to other cities, north to the City of Hialeah and south, I think, to the City of Coral Gables. You can try searching for an apartment near one of the other train stations, and you'll be one of the lucky few people here who can take the train to work."

Miami,3bwlne,inhplease,2,Mon Jul 6 05:30:58 2015 UTC,"When you say ""the north Miami beach area"" you should be aware that you could be referring to a number of different things, and in this context, capitalization does matter.  First, you could be referring to the northern part of Miami Beach - north Miami Beach, usually referred to as North Beach. North Beach is a neighborhood in the City of Miami Beach, as opposed to a city. That is kind of a nice area, compared to the rest of South Florida, in that it is relatively walkable and on the beach. There are some bars and there's a small amount of nightlife; less than in South Beach (at the other end of the same city), but more than pretty much everywhere else.  Second, there is North Miami Beach, an independent city about 14 miles north of Miami. North Miami Beach - like a lot of other places in South Florida - is intentionally misnamed in order to trick people who are not from here into vacationing or buying property. In this case, it is the word ""beach"" - North Miami Beach is not on a beach at all, but is in fact an inland city. As a city, it is not Miami Beach, and it is not Miami. It is a mostly suburban city with a small downtown that runs along 163rd Street. The downtown area, like the rest of the city, is not walkable, does not cater to a younger crowd, and does not have bars or nightlife. It is mostly just one or two-story buildings, closed businesses, and parking lots.  Be aware that Miami is here. It's likely smaller than you thought it was. Miami has a lot of new buildings but apartments there tend to go for about $1,600 a month at the cheapest.  The fact that you will be working in Plantation will be a major setback if you want to be near the things you describe, nightlife and bars and a younger crowd. Plantation is far, not even in Dade County but in Broward. Prepare for two hours of traffic each way. If you want to live in Miami or Miami Beach and work in Plantation, you should buy a bunch of good CDs because you will spend a big chunk of your day sitting in your car and all of our radio stations are terrible. Your friend who will be forced to use public transportation? Depending on where s/he's trying to go, s/he should also plan on getting to the bus stop two hours in advance, because that's about how frequently buses come. South Beach and Miami may be the two parts of South Florida where buses come more frequently, but for everywhere else in Dade and Broward, you'll be lucky to see one bus every hour, plus you'll have to spend at least 15 to 20 minutes walking through suburbs and heat to get to the bus stop.  Having a car is both necessary and a burden here. If you want to go anywhere good, be prepared to spend 30 minutes looking for a space, and carry a lot of extra cash to pay for parking. This especially applies in Miami and Miami Beach, including North Beach. Don't be upset when people don't use their turn signals. Just accept that is the way things are around here. We have some red light cameras so be careful.  Don't pay no mind to the ""Miami-Dade County"" thing, that is also bullshit. It's called Dade County, it always has been. In 1997, some corrupt city commissioners voted to slap the word ""Miami"" into the county name in order to trick people into thinking the entire county is in Miami, and we have not yet been able to fix this. Do not be fooled. Miami is Miami and Dade is Dade.  Prepare for heat. Coming from Michigan, you may have some trouble adjusting. Our heat is nasty and it lasts all year. Keep your windows open and learn to take cold showers. Accept that your clothing will be dirty less than a minute after you walk out the front door. Bring a sweater around with you because a lot of buildings will keep their temperatures down to meat-freezer levels. I am not joking.  If you don't live right next to the beach, but you want to go frequently, remember to bring money for parking. I recommend you get a bicycle. Fort Lauderdale Beach has a bit of a nightlife during tourist season and is much closer to Plantation than Miami and Miami Beach are, and is in the same county. You may try for that, although it might be expensive.  Plantation is an inland, western city, mostly suburbs with gates so as to be cut off from the outside world. If you plan on living close enough to where you work so as not to spend an hour in the car, don't plan on spending too much of your life there. It isn't the best place to be, to say the least."
Miami,3bwlne,bglaros,3,Sat Jul 4 03:47:58 2015 UTC,Keep in mind that it's better to have a ten minute commute to work and be farther from the nightlife than to have an hour commute to work and be closer to the nightlife.  You drive to work every day. You drive to the nightlife maybe once or twice a week. You will waste less of your life away in your car if you live close to work.

The different municipalities can choose to adopt the County's policy though. Here's a little more information on Miami Beach:    The county ordinance under consideration differs in that it decriminalizes a number of different minor offenses in addition to misdemeanor marijuana possession, like stealing shopping carts and loitering. Miami Beach could choose to be bound by the county ordinance, but it would have to adopt the county‚Äôs version. The Beach plan only addresses marijuana, and it creates an appeals process for people who get cited.  http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/miami-beach/article23191569.html#storylink=cpy"

These are not interstate highways, so there isn't much federal funding. We have a huge population using the roads every day. This means that the infrastructure degrades faster, requires more frequent upkeep, and will need significant expansion/upgrade in the near future. Where is that money coming from? The city of Miami and the surrounding towns aren't exactly rolling in surplus cash. We have numerous projects we need to address across the area including upgrading public transportation, improving public education, helping the homeless, and addressing the impact climate change will have on the area.   For the most part you ""chose"" your tolls: you chose where to live, you chose where to work, you chose what road to take. You made all those decisions knowing full well that tolls could increase. You could also reduce how much you spend on tolls by not commuting so far to a job, carpooling, taking public transportation (not really realistic here, I know), by getting a more gas efficient vehicle that reduces your gas bill, or (gasp!) cutting out the $6 coffee you buy every morning from Starbucks."

Miami,3bmaq0,zewm426,10,Tue Jun 30 11:53:03 2015 UTC,I'm curious as to how many kids from rich neighborhoods and how many from poor neighborhoods are going to be approached/cited/detained.  I'm pretty sure that some kid that lives on the key riding his golf cart at 1am to the 7-11 for some munchies won't have any problems with the cops.    Edit: I'm sure most kids won't run into any problems at all and this just gives the authorities some paperwork backing when they DO take action for any reason. But I'm still curious for the metrics after a month of this ordinance.
Miami,3bmaq0,chrism3,12,Tue Jun 30 13:55:22 2015 UTC,I'm sure the police will mostly patrol areas that have the most crime. That's what you do when you have limited resources.   The Key has their own police force that has a history of being very strict with teens btw

The curfew is an ordinance of Miami-Dade County and applies throughout the county.  It's enforced by the Miami-Dade police or by the police of any municipality within Miami-Dade, such as the City of Miami or the Village of Key Biscayne.    It can be.  It isn't.   Whether they choose to do so in particular circumstances is up to individual departments and individual officers - I couldn't say categorically whether they would or wouldn't.   Well you sure as hell implied (actually you stated outright) in your sentence before that that it is in fact enforced by all police departments in Miami-Dade county. Which is not true.

My Dad used to work out in the research center and one afternoon I drove out to see him, right before dusk.  I pulled over on the research road (not many people pass by there) to take a leak - and heard what sounded like the buzz of a generator or high voltage power lines.  About 5 seconds later I realized what it was - thousands upon thousands of hungry mosquitoes in the brush.  Between that realization and getting back to the car - I already had around 25 bites on my face, neck and the back of my legs.  I can imagine that being stranded out in the backcountry like that, not able to start a fire with no fresh drinking water all the while being relentlessly accosted by clouds of starving female anopheles... well that would be no fun at all."

And then these jerks just come along and cut down a swath because it means nothing more that somebody's maybe gonna pay a fine. A fine that'll be more than paid back in revenue from the boat show.  Protections in place might be a deterrent to the average homeowner cutting down mangroves, but for big players like this, it's barely a bump in the road to riches."

In high school I worked at Captain's Tavern on like 92nd st and US1. I can vouch that their seafood is as fresh as it gets. The restaurant was extremely popular when I lived in Miami.   I always liked Scotty's Landing which is right on the water in Coral Gables and is a bit more casual.   Right next door to Scotty's is an upscale seafood restaurant called The Chart House which is also very popular.   Good luck!
Miami,3b6vg7,thesawsebawse,5,Fri Jun 26 13:42:13 2015 UTC,"Scotty's is actually in the Grove (park right next to City Hall), and while I think its view of Dinner Key marina and it's casual setting are just about the best in the Grove, I cannot say the same about the food or service.  I used to go regularly with friends and bring visiting family, but it has just gone so terribly downhill I cannot do it anymore.  Other Coconut Grove seafood options: Next door is Charthouse (more upscale/pricey) but excellent food and comparable view with both indoor/outdoor seating.  If you like ceviche, check out Jaguar next to Cocowalk - just amazing.  Also a must-try - George's on Commodore Plaza.

I don't know anything about large building construction, but if the 'shortcuts' I see from smaller scale general contractors translate to the big jobs...I worry.    There were a ton of windows blown out in Brickell in Wilma '05.  I can't imagine that was predicted to happen in the design/testing part of the build, nor would I think it an acceptable thing to lose the integrity of the facade.  Could it have been substandard materials/installation?  Or perhaps an intangible thing like new buildings popping up all over without understanding and compensating for the resulting altered wind loads?  Air speeds up as it passes around a building (sort of like how you get lift on an airplane wing). I just hope all the engineers and architects are accounting for this stuff."

Miami,3b24fh,icancut,18,Thu Jun 25 10:25:51 2015 UTC,"https://youtu.be/aJCWziYxRVs?t=1m1s    On a serious note. Sadly, Rock isn't very popular in Miami. We even lost our only modern rock radio station a while back. All we have left is a station that plays ""classic rock"". Not many rock bands make it down here unless it's part of a festival like warped tour.  If you want to find rock shows you will have to either go to see local shows at small venues (churchill's for example) or drive up to Broward and West Palm. You can occasionally catch a show over at Grand Central, but that's about it.  There just isn't a market for Rock down here. Several stations have tried over the years and end up changing formats because there was no money in Rock. Bands tend to avoid coming this far down in the state, so most shows end up being up north. This lets them get people from the north to come down and people from the south to come up, a middle ground if you will. Usually ends up being in Lauderdale for band tours and West Palm for festivals.  I think you'll find Latin, Hip-Hop and EDM as a larger market down here. Lots of DJs come to Miami, lots of rappers LIVE in Miami and well.. Latin music is self explanatory. That leaves very little room for Rock.  Back when I used to work in a music store I remember that we sold a lot more Rap and Reggaeton music than we did any Rock. We would get a few people here and there but not to the point of having to order a few boxes of Daddy Yankee because we kept selling out of that CD."

I think part of it is that Miami is so far off the tour map that young people don't get exposed to the music and then don't start bands.   I grew up in central NJ at a time when hardcore, post hardcore, and punk was exploding. On any given weekend there were several shows a night with tons of bands across all kinds of sub genres and all kinds of venues. There is absolutely nothing like that here. And even my buddies who are in successful bands all these years later who tour globally never come to SoFL and at best may hit Orlando. I always have to fly to catch them if it has been awhile. SoFL is just way off the map for them.

It's really a shame how small the rock community is here in Miami. I love rock music and there is literally no radio stations or good venues for rock. And artists rarely come down to Miami so you pretty much always have to travel [at least a little] to see a live performance. The truth of the reality is Miami sucks for rock music.

Bands like Against All Authority (who are FROM Miami) and Against Me! have played there. About 10 to 13 years ago, it was pretty much the home of all of Miami's punk / hardcore / DIY scene and a host to many popular native Miami bands (Tyranny of Shaw, Tunes for Bears to Dance To, Pygmy, etc). The main problem is that it was basically run by a co-op of 16 to 19 year old kids, who put together shows, sold zines and vegan food and had a ""record label"". Eventually all of them went off to college or just moved our of Miami and that was the end of that. The Alley closed and there really hasn't been any place like it since."

They're competitive and I really don't care if I pay a small premium over the store (soda is the big one) because I don't have to make a trip.  I usually give $1 tip, you change it on the app. A little more if it's the 1 hour. It's not necessary though.  I usually check the ""it's ok to leave unattended"" box because I'm antisocial"

Miami,3attw9,alphagrandios,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:13:36 2015 UTC,You can write into the delivery instructions to leave it with concierge. I ordered something I knew would arrive as I was out to lunch and I wrote in to leave it with the receptionist.
Miami,3attw9,digitall565,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:20:13 2015 UTC,cool.. I mean the whole point of ordering it is that you need it and supposedly would be there to get it.. LOL.. but yeah incidentals such as out to lunch (or a massive dump in progress)
Miami,3attw9,brewtalizer,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:25:00 2015 UTC,"Used the 1 hour delivery and got what I purchased in about 20-30 minutes after placing the order.  I've used the service in 33166 and 33184 zip codes.  At checkout there's the option to tip and at what price.  They recommend $5 I believe but can be adjusted.    If I remember correctly 1 hr had an additional charge of $14.99 or so, and 2+ hr was free with Prime?  Correct me if I'm wrong.  It's really a great service and I'm glad they are rolling it out in Miami.  I had a trip and realized last minute we needed a critical item.  It was Easter Sunday and all stores that would have it were closed.  Amazon saved our asses."

Miami,3attw9,evanrphoto,2,Tue Jun 23 17:16:50 2015 UTC,"The weird thing to me is that you must order it from your phone app?!?! Why... I don't know.   Not just that but they treat it as a different service entirely, so even though it's your Prime account, none of the order information shows up on your web account. I think they'll probably integrate them eventually and you'll be able to search by Prime Now-eligible items like you can search for Prime-eligible."
Miami,3attw9,digitall565,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:21:11 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It is very confusing. But I suppose it has something to do with it being local only to a few cities, but it still seems like there should be better integration since they do know where I live etc."

The only weird thing I've had is that I've check ""ok to leave unattended"" and they called me until I answered the door (I was napping). I love it, would definitely use again."
Miami,3attw9,DrPapiChulo,-5,Tue Jun 23 23:22:45 2015 UTC,You have to tip?  It's not free then.  Amazon should pay their drivers a wage that does not require the customers to subsidize.    Tipping shows how this is not economical.  I was wondering how they were able to offer it free with prime.

They do a point inspection and run a computer diagnostic and everything. All you would have to do is have the seller meet you at any dealership lot with a service center.

Imagine just grabbing as an experiment 1/2 mile and inviting the best street artists of the world to go nuts with the hundreds of pilons there.

What if every hundred meters we'd bring sculptures?  It'd be the greatest open air museum in the world, people in traffic on US1 would have something more pleasant to look at, tourists would simply hop on/off the metro rail and start doing art tours, small cafes, a food truck mile, and restaurants would flourish with the pedestrian traffic, more people would use it as a park to exercise.

THE MONEY WOULD BE BETTER SPENT ON BUILDING PEDESTRIAN BRIDGES SO IT IS NOT SO DANGEROUS TO CROSS THE ROAD.  secondly, to compare the underline with the high line in new York city is like apples and oranges.  the underline will still be just a path under the metrorail and next to a highway.  nothing to see.  it will not create new ped/bike paths (because the path already exists) and it will not be a tourist attraction (what tourist wants to go see a sidewalk?)"
Miami,3arkeu,miamiis,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:47:50 2015 UTC,"I actually LIKE the curvy path when cycling, because you get to have about half your bike ride shaded most times of the day. If it were straight, you'd either have shade the whole ride or no shade."

Miami,3arkeu,spooky-funk,6,Tue Jun 23 10:36:52 2015 UTC,You're right. A line out west would be a hell of a lot more important than one to the beach.

Miami,3arkeu,dcht,2,Tue Jun 23 14:19:03 2015 UTC,"Just looked it up, you are right. I stand corrected.  Still would guess substantially higher costs to get to the beach though. Money would be better spent on westbound extension, but I'd imagine you'd piss off half the count with the eminent domain actions you'd have to take to get it built."
Miami,3arkeu,alexcabrera,2,Tue Jun 23 15:55:15 2015 UTC,"On paper, it should go pretty far. In reality, the usual corruption, mismanagement, lawsuits and budget cuts would get you 1 station and the wrong sized trains."

Also, I don't believe the idea was to make the traffic flow better, it was to give people the option to avoid traffic, at a cost."
Miami,3apxfl,dcht,4,Mon Jun 22 15:58:23 2015 UTC,"You don't avoid it. The way it's designed, traffic is inevitable."
Miami,3apxfl,jennysbox,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:57:10 2015 UTC,Traffic is inevitable the way highways and our public transportation system are designed.
Miami,3apxfl,L1mb0,2,Mon Jun 22 23:32:00 2015 UTC,"It's absolutely about money. It's illegal to put tolls on federal highways (I-95 for example) so the robber barons found a loophole and created express lanes that can charge over $10. The highest ""toll"" ever in Florida. Those plastic poles are pennies compared to the millions they're raking in with this scam."

Miami,3apxfl,shallowwatersailor,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:14:58 2015 UTC,"if the highway incorporates existing state roads, states are allowed to continue charging tolls for access."
Miami,3apxfl,jennysbox,-1,Wed Jun 24 16:33:30 2015 UTC,I'm sure the toll income far exceeds the cost to construct and maintain all of our interstate highways.
Miami,3apxfl,L1mb0,2,Mon Jun 22 23:33:38 2015 UTC,How very snarky of you but you failed to understand that the interstate highway system is paid for by the Federal Government and these express lanes are a cash grab by corrupt local politicians. Must I spell it out again?  It is illegal for local governments to toll the Federal interstate systems so the local politicians are using the express lane loophole to fill their coffers.
Miami,3apxfl,jennysbox,-1,Mon Jun 22 23:50:35 2015 UTC,"Do you really think someone is diving into a pool of money Scrooge McDuck style? The tolls go to fund other roadway improvements in the county where each segment runs. It's inane that real public transportation isn't being seriously planned and funded right now but it's silly to think that this revenue goes into ""the pockets of corrupt local politicians."""
Miami,3apxfl,digitall565,2,Tue Jun 23 00:36:59 2015 UTC,"it's silly to think that this revenue goes into ""the pockets of corrupt local politicians.""   You're right, it doesn't. The way the corruption works is thus:  Developers fund local politicians' campaigns -> local politicians lobby for express lanes and tolls -> contracts for the construction of said express lanes goes to the developers funding the politicians' campaigns -> politicians (often) get to ""retire"" in a very nice position with these developers who they funnelled projects to.  People who are not familiar with this relationship, especially here in Miami where it is particularly egregious, are not paying good enough attention."
Miami,3apxfl,Flymia,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:25:05 2015 UTC,"""the pockets of corrupt local politicians.""   No, but the money certainly goes to the politicians friends and donors, such as the massive companies involved in building and maintaining the freeways."

I personally can't wait for the express lanes on the 826. I commute on this highway every day and my commute gets worse every month. If express lanes will be able to put some of these rigs and long-distance commuters on a separate lane, it would make my life easier."
Miami,3apxfl,miamiis,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:29:51 2015 UTC,"The express lanes were redesigned, specifically at Ives Dairy on 95S. They made this the new entry point. Regular traffic on 95S gets congested at 163rd. The redesign of the express lanes only has 1 lane - and that's after having a 2nd lane that goes back into traffic, but you know Miami drivers aren't going to wait in one lane, so people drive as far as they can go and force themselves into the one available lane, while stopping the second lane. If they drew this on paper, anyone that actually drives would immediately point out the design error. But it's reality. A messy reality...that costs me money."

Miami,3apxfl,ThePutana,-2,Tue Jun 23 00:37:49 2015 UTC,"What a fucking troll. You think you could've done a better job of designing that? The reason traffic is bad around the Express Lanes in that area is because work is still going on and people are getting adjusted to the new lane configurations.   When done correctly, they do help manage traffic flow, assuming people don't cross over the delineators and/or crashes within the Express Lanes."

Miami,3agjd1,Bageland2000,21,Fri Jun 19 23:41:36 2015 UTC,Fairchild Tropical Garden is a really beautiful place... You could do outdoorsy stuff like kayaking at Oletta State Park or Deering Estate. Wynwood is great for bars and trnedy stuff. That's the area with all the art on the walls. The Grove is kinda nice to walk around and there are good restaurants around there.

Bring your own picnic basket, explore the grounds, do a tasting. All their wines are made from tropical fruits and they are amazing. They have live bands too. Great place.  Big cypress in the Everglades. Go on a wading tour through the swamps. Breathtaking!  Wynwood museum walks are either weekly or monthly and you get to experience the local artists. Great little pubs and hipster caf√©s are all over wynwwod too.  The beach- yes, but not south beach. Try bill baggs in key biscayne and take a walk up in the lighthouse.    That's all I can think of now... i need more coffee."

Tropical Park - On Bird Road (I believe?), great fishing spot as well as a park. :D Also, Tropical Chinese is right across which is an AMAZING (albeit somewhat expensive) Chinese joint.  Mathison (Beach/Park/Marina) Adjoining fairchild, small park that's neat to picnic at, and the Beach is fun to visit if you're not feeling up to Crandon or Miami Beach  Crandon and Bill Baggs are two beaches on Key Biscayne that are highly recommended. Snorkeling there can be incredible.  Greynolds (might be spelling it wrong) in Hialeah is also a fun park. Do not recommend bringing food though, as there are raccoons. :(  Of course, the Everglades has some amazing places. Anhinga Trail, Shark Valley, and Swamp Walks are just to name a few. You could probably look up a whole list.  If you need anything else feel free to ask. I'm 16 and I've lived in Miami for all my life and so has my dad, so he's taken me to all of the good spots. :)"

It takes a lot of work to get things done. Plus, a lot of public salaries are less than the private sector."
Miami,3ag9ad,catmanus,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:33:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the county government employs over 30,000 people (not including schools). If only 492 people are earning over $140,000 then that represents 1.6% of employees. According to Census data, approximately 3.1% of people in the US make $140,000 or more, so Miami-Dade County actually has a substantially more egalitarian pay-scale than the average.  For some perspective, the largest private employer Baptist Health employs 15,000 people. UM is next at ~13,000 employees. How many people do you think make over $140,000 at Baptist and UM? I would guess that number is well into the thousands."
Miami,3ag9ad,catmoon,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:31:16 2015 UTC,"I feel like this is a terrible argument. Obviously more people at Baptist Health make more, they're doctors! Come on now. Plus UM is a private school and one of the best in the nation."
Miami,3ag9ad,AnthonyWithNoH,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:56:24 2015 UTC,"Those were just two examples to put things into perspective. My main point is that the rate of these salaries is actually below the national average.  The Census Bureau data show that the national average percentage of people making that salary is twice as high as the percentage of people employed by the county who do.   To me, this seems like the most practical and rational way to analyze how appropriate salaries are. Shouldn't public sector employee pay-scales align somewhat with the general population?"
Miami,3ag9ad,catmoon,-5,Thu Jun 25 11:23:44 2015 UTC,"People also forget that Dade County is not Miami, it is an entire county. Two-thirds of it is Everglades. Another reason why the name change was a bad idea."
Miami,3ag9ad,g_chillin,5,Sat Jun 20 17:39:48 2015 UTC,"Some overpaid, some just what they should be paid. However these salaries don't count great benefits and pensions later. That's the thing, they should be paid a bit less than private sector because of the benefits, especially the pension. They hire top notch attorneys, but most attorneys don't get pension plans, they do, along with above average salarys.   The only people who are working for less than average are the medical examiners. Funny how the MD is the only job on there that is not overpaid. And I'm not saying all the attorneys are overpaid or all the cops and FD are, plenty of them should make $100k+ even 150k but $300k? That's excesive IMO.   And can someone please tell me what the hell the deputy mayors do? How do I get that job?!   Oh and I like how the aviation director (who is the head of Miami's largest economic engine) is paid less than many on the list...."
Miami,3ag9ad,Flymia,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:01:46 2015 UTC,"The thing is I don't think anyone would fault a 100-200k yearly paycheck, if the job merits it. Someone overseeing like 200 people or the head finance people probably deserve that kind of paycheck, but we should be paying close to market rate fair wages for labor, not like 1.5 times the equivalent in the private sector.   TBH municipal workers should be made elligible for social security and not be in these pension schemes that are insolvent. I think paygo and ira type of things are much more likely to protect taxpayers and public workers in comparison to pensions that can be used as city slush funds."

Miami,3ag9ad,cofojc,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:34:25 2015 UTC,Throw in them being swat or some sort of specialty and maybe bilingual incentive pay. The big scam is retiring at their highest pay.   Some municipalities will give them lots of overtime in their last year and they end up making 110k or 130k and then have that pay inflation adjusted and paid by the taxpayer. Or they work 20 years each at the fire dept and police straight out of high school and make 200 plus k per year at age 58

Even FDLE Special Agents only start out in the 45-50k range.   FHP morale is pretty low, pay is nowhere as good as large county and cities make. But FHP does get a good amount of OT work."

Miami,3a7hnm,platypocalypse,2,Thu Jun 18 12:20:38 2015 UTC,"They shut down the Venetian Causeway. The McArthur Causeway is still open. On this map, you can see both. In Miami, the Venetian Causeway is 15th Street and the McArthur Causeway is 12th Street - they are only a block away from one another. However, in the City of Miami Beach, they're like ten blocks away from one another. A lot of people will tell you that biking the McArthur Causeway is not safe, but I've done it many times; lots of people do it, it has bike lanes and you'll be fine. The Julia Tuttle Causeway - 36th Street in Miami, 41st Street in Miami Beach - is not safe for bikes, don't try that one. Since the Venetian causeway is closed you'll have to take the McArthur Causeway to ride between cities, but I think only the very end of the Venetian Causeway is closed, right before it gets into Miami, so you'll still be able to explore it from the Miami Beach side and it's worth seeing."

Miami,3a7hnm,steve70638,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:20:18 2015 UTC,Just ride up Collins and back on Indian Creek.  A nice ride would be to the Haulover Inlet bridge and back. Do it in the morning to beat the traffic. There are variations to avoid the traffic lights but it still isn't a bad ride (I do it several times a week).
Miami,3a7hnm,steve70638,2,Thu Jun 18 11:51:46 2015 UTC,"So riding Collins all the way up to Hollywood area is doable? Looks like there is a decent shoulder to ride on; what's the speed limit? Might ride up and back; around 40 miles or so. Yes, it will be in the morning, not a fan of heavy traffic and heat. :)"
Miami,3a7hnm,platypocalypse,2,Thu Jun 18 12:19:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, very doable.  The Bridge at Haulover is your main hill.  Through Southbeach north of Dade Blvd, look at going through Pinetree and La Gorce connecting to Collins and Indian Creek in the 50s (Mainly Pinetree but it is one way as you get north).  Once you are in the 50s, it is much less commercial.  Collins is usually two lanes in each directions on the southern part.  Then it is one way with 2-3 lanes with decent shoulders or just wide enough lanes.  It joins back up in Bal Harbour to two way.  There is no clear bike lanes but this time of year in low season and particularly in the morning there isn't much traffic on it.  One of the best parts of the ride are the causeways to the mainland but right now, there is heavy construction and lane closures on the Venetian, the 79th St and the Bal Harbour one which are the only scenic ones.

My job moved me and my wife and kid in 06 to Texas. Was there for 7 years and moved back in 2012. Now have three kids. And yeah. South Florida sucks to raise kids. And for the youth in general. I'm now 35. And I hate it here. Came back for family. But after experiencing another city raising kids here sucks. High cost of living. Low quality of life. People are generally pissed at life. Raising respectable kids here is impossible.   Those who will blast me and say I'm wrong are probably from here and have never lived anywhere else.

I'd park kind of underneath that 2nd bridge and just walk over to the water - you get a great view of downtown.  Another view I enjoyed was off of Brickell.

There used to be a fence there that was knocked down and although it was technically off limits there would be a dozen people there at any one time on a given night enjoying the view. Every once in a while cops would come by and ask people to leave but never much of a hassle. Recently they started doing some construction there again and I am not sure if you can get to the water, but I think its still worth a shot since it is by far the best vantage point.  Otherwise I would try down the dirt road by the water plane tour place right next to the Virginia Key side of the big bridge."

Miami,39xnso,urahozer,2,Mon Jun 15 17:15:37 2015 UTC,"Here are a few things I suggest you do here in Miami: * Eat at a local Cuban restaurant. If you want a good ""chain"" restaurant I suggest Sergio's. But trust me, there are plenty of great mom & pop restaurants. I suggest getting a classic breakfast with a cafe con leche, or vaca frita for lunch/dinner. * Visit Wynwood. This area is up and coming and it's very cool. There's art work everywhere and great bars to hang out at. The good part about Wynwood is that it's walkable [unlike most of Miami]. Since you mention being in town early October, I highly suggest you go to Wynwood on the 2nd Saturday of the month. They have an artwalk every month that's really fun [unless you don't want to be around crowds, then don't go for artwalk]. * Go to a club. It's Miami!! I personally love The Electric Pickle, Tree House, Grand Central/The Garret [2nd floor of Grand Central], and Space [if you REALLY want to party]. Every Friday night The Garret has a free old school hip hop night that's really fun if you're looking to save. * Visit Fairchild Botanical Gardens. It's absolutely gorgeous and in October, the weather should be perfect for that. If you like nature I highly suggest this place.   Hope this helps, feel free to message me if you have any questions!"
Miami,39xnso,thatwetsp0t,2,Mon Jun 15 20:30:14 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thank you very much for your input.  Sounds like tons of fun to be had in those suggestions"
Miami,39xnso,Brett4Life,2,Mon Jun 15 20:47:03 2015 UTC,"Also worth noting, the clubbing experience REALLY varies. Agrees Pickle, Tree House, Garret are all solid (some of my favs), but be aware those are smaller clubs geared towards mostly deep house music. If you want the David Guetta laser lightshow asshole experience, definitely check out Mansion, Story, Liv.   Wynwood is seriously great. Get craft beers at BXLDR or J Wakefield Brewing Co. Get a taco at Coyo (and check out their ""secret"" club through the back door). Do a round of the funs bars there: Wood Tavern, Gramps, TSL (The Social Lubricant). The Butcher Shoppe right next to TSL is also a good spot for a bite + craft beer, especially since its partly outdoors and will be nice in October.  As far as beaches, you can't go wrong with South Pointe Park on South Beach. Its basically the same as all the other South Beach beaches but there's a rock jetty that juts out and makes for good snorkeling, as well as a walkway over the water. Also worth checking out Key Biscayne if you have a car, its about a 20 minute drive from South Beach. There's Crandon Park there which has a nice beach, way more local and chill, but be aware not really any food or drinks around. There's also Bill Baggs state park a couple more miles into Key Biscayne which also has more local friendly beaches, as well as some nice nature trails and a lighthouse that you can go up inside. There's a restaurant on the beach in Baggs as well, although food is average.   Looking for a nice dinner out? I would probably avoid south beach. Mandolin is probably my favorite restaurant in the city. Pretty nice greek place, awesome whole fish and upscale greek fare. Terrific dinner for two in a very nice atmosphere with a bottle of wine about $150.   Downtown doesn't have that much going on, but if you have to see it, walk Bayfront Park and then walk a block or two into downtown and check out the cheap tourist shops and have a VERY cheap cuban meal at any of the little places. NIU Kitchen downtown is a bright spot, Catalan Spanish style restaurant, similar price to Mandolin, maybe a little cheaper. Small, intimate spot.   Little Havana is not all it's cracked up to be IMO, and I think a trip could be complete without it, but its worth having a meal at Versailles. Pretty fun atmosphere, but don't expect incredible food. And for the love of god don't get the fish..  Other Miami things to do: Get into a car or boating accident. Argue about Castro and the the Cuban embargo. Smoke a cigar. Buy some gaudy beachwear!!  Have fun :)"

Miami,39xhom,ed-s,3,Mon Jun 15 16:31:51 2015 UTC,"Similar situation, I subleased for 6 weeks when I first moved here, and am really glad I did for a few reasons.   1) Gives you time to do research into the rental market here. It's pretty important to see the places you are offering on and check out the neighborhoods / ask some locals  2) Often you can find a sublet (especially during summer) that is cheaper than what you'd be paying monthly for a long term lease. This is due to it being the downseason and having college kids out of town. The longer the better, if you can get 2-3 months of a cheap lease that gives you time to assess the work and living situation.  Cheers and best of luck.  Edit: said college kids IN town, meant to say OUT OF town"
Miami,39xhom,Brett4Life,3,Mon Jun 15 17:38:18 2015 UTC,Subleasing is easy in the summer/fall.  It's a good idea not to commit on a location until your learn the area.  Personally I'm moved further up north every year since I'm been here.
Miami,39xhom,theman1119,2,Mon Jun 15 17:47:21 2015 UTC,I agree with /u/brett4life at the end of the day each area can change significantly over just a few blocks.

Rent will be relatively easy to make between us both and that's all I'm worried about aside from my recurring bills. I'm not under any kind illusions that I'm going to show up and magically live in South Beach....no. I wouldn't even want to. I've been there before, not interested in living IN Miami, unless some great offer falls on my lap. Otherwise, we're modest apartment, living minimally and just going from there."

Miami,39qcee,platypocalypse,3,Mon Jun 15 01:17:01 2015 UTC,That doesn't constitute corruption. That's the democratic process.  They ought to drop the Dade and just rename it Miami County already.

You don't even know enough about this county to make any intelligent comments on it, and you want to go and turn the whole region into Miami. Miami is one city in a diverse and unique county. You're just as bad as anyone else who wants to go to a region you know nothing about and start fucking with shit."
Miami,39qcee,platypocalypse,0,Wed Jun 17 16:32:50 2015 UTC,"Ah there it is, the Miami and transplant phobia.   You don't even know enough about this county to make any intelligent comments on it.   You've lived here longer and haven't made a single intelligible response. Short of telling me to fuck off, you've only made arguments on the basis of your emotions and feelings. The irony of it is, my argument had historical and empirical data backing its premise, and yet I've only been here for a short while. Instead of acknowledging a valid point, that the Dade massacre has very little value on the name of this region, you focused on an ad-hominem attack.   You're just as bad as anyone else who wants to go to a region you know nothing about and start fucking with shit.   Ah, the old ""get off my lawn"" bit. ""Not in my backyard."" Your arguments are trite, your attitude is unnecessary, and you presence is unwanted.  I don't need to explain to you that Miami's tourism and economy attracts more growth to this area, or that the developments in the city are responsible for gentrifying the outside perimeters. Because even if I did, you would be too emotional to comprehend or counter.  The fact of the matter is that you have no argument, no premise, or data. All you have is your emotions, and clearly they're out of control so there's no point in trying to reason with someone so irrational."
Miami,39qcee,Dinosour,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:56:11 2015 UTC,"The irony of it is, my argument had historical and empirical data backing its premise   Bullshit. You haven't made any real arguments, you've only said that you ""feel"" Dade County should be Miami.  The Dade massacre was fucked up - and it was part of Jackson's war which drove the Seminole and Miccosukee peoples into Dade and Broward - but the entire history of the Americas is fucked up, from Canada to Chile. It has been suggested to give the county an indigenous name, like Tequesta or Calusa County, and that's fine. Guess what - the Miami Indians were from Ohio, not Florida.   Because having lived here for a short time, there's nothing that I have encountered that's even remotely ""Dade-like.""   So you admit it. You have no idea what Dade County is and yet you are intent on destroying it and replacing it with one city in the county. I've probably lived in Dade for longer than you've been alive, but you show up here and say, ""Oh, I like Miami, let's change the whole county's name to 'Miami.'"" Dade is an enormous county with many cities which are not Miami, and those of us from the county are proud to be from Dade, and from whichever cities we happen to be from. Miami gets a lot of tourists, good for Miami, that is irrelevant. Miami Beach gets a lot of tourists, too, possibly more than Miami does. Sunny Isles gets tons of tourists. So does Fort Lauderdale. Aventura's mall is apparently world-famous. Other parts of Dade are quieter and more relaxed. You can still find cows in the western and southern parts. Southwestern Dade is huge tracts of farmland, and West Dade is all Everglades, encompassing far more landmass than the suburban parts of the county (although the suburbs encroach dangerously further each year). All of these places are obviously not Miami. Miami is a small city at the center of Dade's east coast. It's a nice city, and it is famous, and it is the county seat, and that is Miami. Miami ends at Miami's borders.  There is no ""get off my lawn"" or phobia about this. Tourists and out-of-towners are welcome as long as they treat the place with respect. If I go to your house and start urinating on it and you get upset, and I reply with, ""Look, yellow is a nice color; your neighbor's house is yellow, and he gets lots of visitors!"" You will likely ask me to get off your lawn. That is what you are doing here. You are showing up in a place you know nothing about and pissing on it.  Another example would be renaming New Jersey ""Gay New York"" because New York is famous and gets lots of tourists. Some people - people who are not from New Jersey - will say, ""Yeah! What a great idea! Let's name the whole region New York!"" But people from New Jersey who have lived there for generations will say, ""No, this is not New York, this is New Jersey. Stop calling us that.""  Furthermore, many of Dade County's biggest problems - the ones people complain most about in this sub - come from these foolish attempts to treat the county as a city. A county is a third-level administrative district that contains many independent cities. That's the whole point of having a separate city and county. When people all over the county depend on Miami as if it's the only city in Dade, rather than looking to their own city for their city-level needs, you will get traffic - hours of traffic - sprawl, highways with ridiculous tolls instead of trains, public transport failures, few schools, and bad infrastructure. That is why Jacksonville is a terrible place to live. And that is exactly what they are trying to do to Dade County.  A city is not a county. Period. If you dislike Dade so much - and I admit he was an asshole, just like Broward, just like Andrew Jackson and George W. Bush and Custer - then we can change the county name to something relevant and sensible, the best options being indigenous groups that actually were native to this region. But naming the county after one of the cities in it is foolish and disrespectful to all the people in the county, including the people of Miami, because it is stealing their city's image. It would be like renaming Florida the State of Orlando. There is no reason for it, and at least ten reasons against it."
Miami,39qcee,platypocalypse,0,Thu Jun 18 16:20:22 2015 UTC,"Assumptions, irrelevant comparisons, and ad-hominem attacks.  And, yes I did put forth an argument to your other response:   If you look at the historical artifacts behind the name, it doesn't even make sense because the Dade massacre happened in central Florida, and there is a Dade city right nearby.   The sad thing is, you have some valid arguments, about the separation of administrative districts, but your credibility went out the window the moment you let your emotions get the best of your ability to discuss rationally without fallacious rebuttals.  Looking at your post history is indicative that all you care about is being right at the expense of courtesy or suspending your motivations for the sake of discerning truth from value."
Miami,39qcee,Dinosour,0,Thu Jun 18 17:12:20 2015 UTC,"It was corrupt because they are trying to convince people who aren't from here that Dade County is Miami. Seems to have worked on you. In Broward, they won that fight when the same elements tried to change it to ""Fort Lauderdale County."" A city is not a county. Dade County is a diverse place with over thirty independent cities and unincorporated areas. In Jacksonville, they merged the city and county together and now people all over the county are forced to go to Jacksonville for their basic needs. You are part of the problem. Dade County is not Miami and there is nothing you can do to change that."
Miami,39qcee,platypocalypse,0,Mon Jun 15 14:59:50 2015 UTC,"You are part of the problem.   You're delusional. The fact of the matter is that Miami has the biggest influence in ""Dade"" county. If you look at the historical artifacts behind the name, it doesn't even make sense because the Dade massacre happened in central Florida, and there is a Dade city right nearby.   There is nothing you can do to change that.   The Home Rule power disagrees.   Stop being so butthurt. There are plenty of cities in the nation whose names are incorporated into the county. Los Angeles county comprises a vast territory where only 1/6th of the land actually composes the city of Los Angeles."

Miami,39li61,Ksight3,19,Fri Jun 12 17:02:12 2015 UTC,Went from Fort Lauderdale airport to Brickell for $35 with Uber. Taxis have cost me $80. And of course the car and driver were much better.
Miami,39li61,13104598210,-11,Fri Jun 12 19:31:36 2015 UTC,"All good points but that's because taxi fares are regulated.  Look at the stickers in the windows, where Uber is not.  Taxi's pay taxes and fees & Uber does not. Yes your wallet is spared but the community is not, even though both are using public roadways to operate their business."

Miami,39li61,TheHairUpThere,3,Fri Jun 12 18:29:39 2015 UTC,"Just off the top of my head (there are several articles and discussion forums where I've read this):   Frequently discounting fares for customers that directly impacts drivers' pay (they don't make up the difference for the drivers). Suspending ""surge pricing"" that drivers really want, again impacting pay. Allowing bad customers to negatively impact drivers with bad reviews and leaving drivers little to no recourse.   Here's an article I've read from Philly that sums it up pretty well. It's long, and yes it's only one account, but I've read similar complaints on driver discussion forums. I found it because I was researching the possibility of becoming a driver myself to maybe make some extra cash on weekends, but from what I've seen it may not really be worth it."
Miami,39li61,gustavoperez,4,Fri Jun 12 18:37:46 2015 UTC,"Some good points except for the third. It's the best system we've got to hold drivers accountable. Sure some drivers are going to get boned by a string of bad customers but on the whole it's far better than no accountability. It's a symbiotic relationship, one which I think is far better than cab drivers doing whatever the fuck they want.   As far as how Uber is compensating their drivers I also totally agree that they are bending them over. From our position we should promote as much competition as possible. Next time you're thinking of taking an uber take a Lyft instead. Uber's argument is going to be well our costs are several fold higher currently than they have to be now because we are involved in litigation in dozens of states and probably thousands of municipalities. But the truth of the matter is even after they win the battle against the Taxi lobby they will never give those costs back to the drivers. It's like asking banks to give back the profits they make from ATMs."
Miami,39li61,sfvalet,0,Fri Jun 12 19:10:22 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on the first paragraph. It isn't a perfect system, but of course there needs to be something. It just seems like Uber does as little as they can to help their drivers out, and my third bullet is just a part of that."

If anything, it only serves to widen the gap of understanding and respect between cyclists and motorists.  If they would actually start obeying traffic lights, I would actually start respecting the movement since it is all based on ""sharing the road""...a concept which Critical Mass blatantly shits on.    I commute to and from work on my bike on a regular basis and would love for Miami drivers to show some courtesy but only if it goes both ways.  I hate most cyclists on these streets equally or more so than the drivers.  The majority of cyclists I encounter run red lights and stop signs with impunity without the least bit of recognition for motorists/other cyclists.  The worst groups are the spandex-clad weekend riders who clog entire lanes and actively try to block passing motorists but thankfully that seems to be just a early morning weekend thing.  Don't get me wrong....the motorists in this town are by far the worst I've encountered in the entire U.S. but the cyclist side is far from superior.

However when my dad came to this country he was a NYC cab driver and was able to earn/save enough money to open his own business.  Being a cab driver is one of very few gateways to the middle class for hardworking immigrants.  I don't think you realize the issues you have with the industry are a construct of laws regulated by local government.  The city/county sets the fare rates, they also establish how many cabs/medallions are available, they establish safety protocols and they collect taxes & fees which benefit the local community.  Taxi owners & drivers just follow the established rule of law."

It's almost always worth using express lanes.    The best advice though, join/start a van pool if possible.  Save money, take turns driving, and sleep more. We van pool a lot at my work."

Miami,39ie3n,digitall565,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:28:21 2015 UTC,"Your explanation is way too simplistic and does not paint the whole picture. Autonation IMAX at the Museum of Science is the only way to watch blockbuster movies that are released in full 70mm. Few are released that way, and few are filmed entirely using 3D cameras, but that doesn't mean digital IMAX is totally inferior.  For a big movie like Jurassic World that won't be released at the Museum of Science, digital IMAX will still provide a larger, crisper image than watching it on a normal screen, and the sound quality will be appropriately better as well. IMAX has perfected this and the ""LIEMAX"" experience is a pretty good one.  And movies don't have to be fully shot in 3D to be good in 3D. Parts of Avatar were post-converted and no one can tell - it really depends on the movie."

Miami,395y72,josetavares,3,Wed Jun 10 02:42:04 2015 UTC,"That's where the insurance reform comes in.  If the insurance companies are forced to follow rules and orifice provide proper and affordable coverage for everyone then there wouldn't be a need to gouge. Also they never see the 920%, trust me, hospitals operate at a deficit."
Miami,395y72,yellowchef,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:18:25 2015 UTC,True
Miami,395y72,josetavares,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:45:33 2015 UTC,Ofcourse they operate at a deficit; for whatever reason they overpay for some of the most basic things such as office and basic medical supplies and then pass along the expense to the customers and the insurance companies.   I recall reading an article/post about how it's common for the hospitals to pay like $15 for a pack of pens that are like $1-2 at staples.   I know this does not account for all of their expenses but they could be making more conscious cost decisions. O_o
Miami,395y72,ilikeowlz,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:15:18 2015 UTC,"They don't pay $15 for a pack of pens or other supplies. They have contacts with vendors for supplies from office supplies to medical supplies.   Hospitals don't ""pass it on to insurance companies"", the insurance companies screw hospitals and providers. All insurance reimbursement is contacted and negotiated. As a hospital they can charge whatever they desire for services, the insurance company will not be reimbursing the hospital what they billed out."
Miami,395y72,yellowchef,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:21:25 2015 UTC,But they overpay for items through those vendors. Which means they run high operating costs which means they have to over bill to remain profitable. Which is probably why the insurance companies refuse to pay whatever they wish to charge as it's not always reasonable. Otherwise why would hospitals charge 300% over for non insurance patients?

Miami,395y72,blo0p,4,Tue Jun 9 21:28:07 2015 UTC,Baptist has a great program for uninsured patients so most uninsured patients end up having to pay a fraction of what they could have been potentially billed.
Miami,395y72,Muchhdper,5,Tue Jun 9 22:38:49 2015 UTC,"Several of the hospitals claimed that, but the article makes a good point:  why have hugely inflated prices, and then give a discount?"
Miami,395y72,TunaNugget,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:30:07 2015 UTC,"It's a problem with the healthcare industry as a whole. I'm at work right now so I can't give you as much detail as I'd like to and even then I'm not the best person to explain but here's a basic idea.   Insurances and health care providers come to agrreance with very complex contracts specifying prices and services the insurance will cover. The healthcare provider provides the services, then bills the insurance for agreed amount, but insurances will almost always find a way to excuse themselves from paying the full amount then pay the amount they desire.   For example a hospital might charge $100 for a service but the insurance company will only cut a check for $70. In turn the health care provider artificially inflates to $150 in hopes of getting the insurance to pay the $100 they originally wanted.  What this creates is a vicious cycle of constantly rising prices. It's both the healthcare providers and insurance companies as the unwillingness to pay full amounts by the insurances and healthcare providers refusal to accept less.  Tl dr: healthcare providers charge X amount. Insurances pay <X causing health care providers to inflate prices to receive X amount from insurances that will again pay <X and the cycle continues.  So in order to answer your question, prices are inflated yes, but discounts are given because most people that are uninsured can't afford the discounted prices so they definitely won't pay the regular prices. It's better to collect some then none."
Miami,395y72,Muchhdper,2,Wed Jun 10 01:38:36 2015 UTC,"I understand that it's MSRP.  But while making perfect sense, it's still irrational.  Other markets aren't faced with this endless inflation spiral; the bubble bursts.  And in the case where the insurance only pays 70 out of the 100, the hospital goes after the patient for the missing 30, because what the heck, it might work."
Miami,395y72,TunaNugget,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:01:06 2015 UTC,It's a horrible system. That's why I'm a supporter of a single payer health system like in Canada and European countries. It's not perfect either but it's more affordable than our current health system and everyone will be insured.
Miami,395y72,Muchhdper,-3,Wed Jun 10 03:21:45 2015 UTC,Sorry but that sounds to me like bs. I went with a friend to urgent care and they had prices posted. He paid the price posted and later got a bill for over 400 dollars after they told him all he would be charged was the 200 that he paid at urgent care before he left.
Miami,395y72,josetavares,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:47:19 2015 UTC,"He needs to call patient accounts and request it. In the hospital they register you directly under financial assistance but in the urgent care setting the financial assistance form has to be sent via mail or they can help him by phone.  In the Urgent Care the initial fee is $199 but since they don't do billing there, they can't tell you the price of the full visit at that time so they charge what they know the minimum will be.  As for calling bullshit on me for something you know nothing of says a lot about you."
Miami,395y72,Muchhdper,-5,Wed Jun 10 02:55:08 2015 UTC,You said:   most uninsured patients end up having to pay a fraction of what they could have been potentially billed.   From 200 dollars and actually paying that amount at urgent care to over 400 dollars more and ignoring the fact that he payed the 200 dollars sounds like pure shenanigans on the part of Baptist  Please don't play the corporate shill card by defending the daily robberies that take place at these hospitals as investigated by the Washington Post.

I've been saying for a while that the economic slumps that are starting to become prevalent in Latin America and especially Brazi- due largely in part to the Petrobras scandal and rising dollar value, will force the opportunistic foreign buyers to slow down.  I also think you are going to start to see some widespread sell-offs once these buyers do some basic math and realize the cost of ownership in the long-term when it comes to property taxes, mortgages and association fees. All of a sudden that cheap apartment isn't so cheap anymore and when faced with a local downturn, cashing out seems like a good move.  Suffice to say I can't wait."

Miami,38qkzf,zorinlynx,-4,Sat Jun 6 14:10:05 2015 UTC,"Baseball in Miami is bullshit.  You should see the kind of fan involvement and community there is in cities like Boston, Pittsburgh, and NYC. It even makes a non-baseball fan like myself want to go to a game just to experience the energy and camaraderie.  I notice none of that around here. They should just sell the team and give up on pro baseball in Miami."
Miami,38qkzf,blacksolid,2,Sat Jun 6 16:25:30 2015 UTC,"Same could be said for basketball or football. Miami is a bandwagon city. We should just sell the Heat and move the Dolphins to LA while we are selling the Marlins too. Comparing Miami to Boston, Pittsburgh and New York, all cities that have had a major baseball team for over 100 years, is like comparing apples to oranges."
Miami,38qkzf,Flymia,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:11:02 2015 UTC,"Same could be said for basketball    This the part people don't understand. People in their 30s and younger who are from Miami are the first people who have grown up with the Heat, Marlins Panthers. You can see it with the Heat how the fans have gotten better etc.. Yes the previous 4 years help a lot but even last season the games were still awesome, and they will continue to be as long as they are competitive and are a good franchise.   Something the Marlins, Dolphins and Panthers can't say.   Its a basketball town now, and IMO will be for a long time to come."
Miami,38qkzf,blacksolid,-1,Sat Jun 6 21:38:51 2015 UTC,"You say that now but wait until the heat dont make the playoffs for a few years. After the 2003 season, Miami loved basbeall but since they havent made the playoffs since, no one wants to admit they are fans. Miami is just a bandwagon city, the amount of people that jumped on the Seahawks bandwagon or ""became"" Cavs fans when Lebron left is a joke."
Miami,38qkzf,Flymia,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:46:38 2015 UTC,"""became"" Cavs fans when Lebron left is a joke.   Those people were never Heat fans, they have always been Lebron fans.    iami loved basbeall but since they havent made the playoffs since, no one wants to admit they are fans.    100% false. They had bad attendance during that year, and bad attendance after. When the Heat are good, (they don't need to be great) but just good they have above average to great attendance. When they are great, or just coming off a great run they sell out every game since April 2010.   Marlins never had any type of sell out strikes. The Heat do, and IMO it will continue into next year assuming the off season goes to plan.   And like I said, the Heat do need to be competitive. Not making the playoffs for years is not competitive. But they will have a strong fan base for years to come, they don't need super teams, just good teams.   No team should have great attendance if their team sucks and can't make the playoffs, and in the NBA besides for the Bulls, Lakers and Knicks if the teams have bad runs the attendance goes down. Look at the Celtics attendance when they had a bad run before getting KG and Allen, they did not have any great ""Boston Sports town"" attendance numbers."
Miami,38qkzf,blacksolid,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:15:29 2015 UTC,"Except the season average for the Marlins in 2003 was was over 16,000 and jumped to over 22,000 in 2004. Its easier to sell out a 20,000 seat arena with 41 games than it is a 36,000 seat stadium with 81 games. You need to think about transit too. The AAA is next to the metro movers while Sun Life has virtually no public transit. Since the Marlins moved to the new park, attendance has averaged around 20,000 except for 2012 which averaged 27,000. Again 20,000 vs 37,000 and twice as many games with less public transit to Marlins Park."

Miami,38n5er,bla8291,14,Sat Jun 6 14:59:56 2015 UTC,Changing the speed limit to 45 on a road that is designed for 60-65 mph can do nothing but harm. It would be different if there were some new features on the road that warranted the change.
Miami,38n5er,robotjosh,6,Fri Jun 5 12:11:03 2015 UTC,Should be ok if they actually enforce it.  Otherwise people will be going anywhere from 45 to 70 instead of 50 to 70.
Miami,38n5er,JCizle,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:33:42 2015 UTC,You mean anywhere from 20-90. Tourists trying to take pics of the scenery and people trying to show off make the speeds on MacArthur go to the extreme.

Miami,38n5er,decoy321,2,Fri Jun 5 13:13:54 2015 UTC,"The new feature is the increased cyclist traffic since they closed down the Venetian. And the decrease in speed might not seem helpful to motorists, but it'll make a huge difference to people on bikes and mopeds, since they can no longer rely on safely crossing via the Venetian Cswy."

Miami,38jpsv,jsanm001,2,Fri Jun 5 19:38:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly? The answer I always give is we offer truly free checking accounts. There is minimum balance to maintain, no direct deposit required, or additional service for it to be free. We also offer true overdraft privilege which let's you overdraft your account akin to a pay day loan but we only charge you one free. They do not accumulate or compound, it's just one fee. Our nsf charge is still only 30. We are full service offer all or most of the same services of all banks."

Miami,38d198,dcht,12,Wed Jun 3 13:03:05 2015 UTC,I'd rather we have a petition to use the tax/toll money to improve public transit.
Miami,38d198,expresswayvisual,-8,Wed Jun 3 13:16:01 2015 UTC,"Miami doesn't work for public transit. Everything is way too spread out for that to happen.  I don't understand what's so difficult to understand about that.  And it's not like it's a brand new city like say Beijing which although is huge, is great for public transport. If you don't mind being sardined. From experience.. The city is also effectively as old as the 2008 Olympics.   Miami Dade county is 2400 square miles.   London and Istanbul are  the only international cities that big with decent public transport that isn't younger than you."
Miami,38d198,apinc,6,Wed Jun 3 22:42:53 2015 UTC,"The urbanized area of the county is significantly smaller than 2,400 square miles and the densest urban areas of the region are found directly along the coast. Every suburb can't reasonably serviced by quality mass transportation but many, many cities (and by extension the majority of residents) can. That includes virtually every city along the coast from just about Pinecrest all the way up to Jupiter. That ignorant, defeatist attitude is a large part of what's holding us back."
Miami,38d198,jennysbox,2,Thu Jun 4 02:00:50 2015 UTC,I agree with you. TriRail's Coastal link is a much needed as well as some sort of west connection to Doral/FIU.

Miami,38d198,alphagrandios,25,Thu Jun 4 15:29:16 2015 UTC,"Why do we need to pay more for highways built more than 30 years ago and the only significant changes were to add the tolling system?

It hasn't occurred to me that the city wasn't funding the infrastructure so well and that they had to resort to tolling.

Miami,38d198,jennysbox,3,Wed Jun 3 18:37:25 2015 UTC,Probably worth pointing out that these tolls probably exist in part because FL has no state income taxes.
Miami,38d198,Brett4Life,2,Wed Jun 3 19:47:04 2015 UTC,Exactly. Either you pay to play or everyone pays for it. Frankly I don't want to subsidize highway expansion any more than I already do so I'm happy with the toll roads.

Miami,38d198,kairoschris,3,Thu Jun 4 15:14:43 2015 UTC,Maybe because Michigan has to deal with cold/hot contraction of the roads and the pounding that snow removal equipment puts on roads.  None of that is an issue here and the roads are still terrible.
Miami,38d198,Musa15,0,Thu Jun 4 21:52:49 2015 UTC,Of course that's why but the point I was making is that the roads are way worse there and they don't even attempt to fix them.

Miami,38d198,apinc,3,Thu Jun 4 13:11:38 2015 UTC,"I love tolls. I would enjoy it if we had more tolls. Every time I have the misfortune of getting on 95 or 595, I always take the express lanes. If it's $9, even better. That means i might actually get to work before the office closes or get home before I'm stuck without dinner. It'll get more people off the road.   Seriously, if you make more than around $20/hr you should be supporting tolls. More tolls means more people take alternate roads. Which means less traffic on the main roads. And the main roads are actually better maintained.  If you drive a car that is bad on gas, you might actually save money paying the tolls versus being stuck in traffic.  Even my employees are under strict instructions to take the fastest route. If that means $40 in tolls (multi axle vehicles) in a day, so be it."
Miami,38d198,apomares23,2,Thu Jun 4 03:08:45 2015 UTC,Right. The middle class/poor get fucked though since they are the ones that mostly use the highways.
Miami,38d198,dadecounty3051,0,Wed Jun 3 18:17:21 2015 UTC,"Middle class doesn't give a fuck. If $50/month really impacts your monthly budget that much, you're not middle class. You're poor. The only ones who should be against this are the poor people. If you don't like it, take an alternate road. There is seriously not a single place in south Florida that absolutely requires even taking a free expressway. Leave earlier and start learning the streets."
Miami,38d198,user0126,3,Wed Jun 3 22:21:06 2015 UTC,It's not about the tolls affecting one person in the middle class specifically. It's about it being a tax that affects the middle class in general the most. State cuts taxes on the rich/corporations and then recuperates it with taxes on the middle class/poor.
Miami,38d198,dcht,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:49:06 2015 UTC,I would agree with your comment but there's still traffic. express lanes aren't even express lanes if there's traffic.
Miami,38d198,user0126,6,Thu Jun 4 22:12:46 2015 UTC,The number of new Florida residents is about 1000 new residents per day. That should be a lot of cars (state wide). Do you think the road infrastructure should keep up with the new and increasing demand of traffic?
Miami,38d198,squall24,-1,Thu Jun 4 22:29:12 2015 UTC,"No, it shouldn't. That only encourages more people to drive."
Miami,38d198,apomares23,-1,Mon Jun 8 06:29:19 2015 UTC,That is correct.
Miami,38d198,Yayohemypo,2,Wed Jun 3 16:15:08 2015 UTC,Tolls are the best form of taxation. It only taxes you if you use it and should only be used for maintenance and improvement of what you are using.
Miami,38d198,apomares23,3,Wed Jun 3 18:02:36 2015 UTC,Yeah but aren't most of the people that use it working class? Seems to me like it's a tax that affects mostly the poor/middle class. Especially if you fuck up and don't pay in time.

Miami,3839v3,The_Bruche,5,Mon Jun 1 15:23:11 2015 UTC,This sucks to the point that I'm likely not going to do any big rides involving both the beach and mainland for a while. It's too bad they couldn't figure out a way to repair the bridge without completely closing it.
Miami,3839v3,zorinlynx,2,Mon Jun 1 17:33:45 2015 UTC,"Ive actually biked MacArthur Pkw for days at time when I lived downtown. Getting on near Museum downtown I found that people would accelerate at me, probably accelerating to get on the bridge but I did have a few close calls that gave me the chills.   The second issue was cars driving in the bike lane, yes in his vid it is day and traffic is moving but start dusk or weekend that road is jammed and some people mistake or just make it a lane to cut around other slow drivers. I have been biking in the bike lane next to the jersey wall and a car coming at or behind me at full speed and no where to go... so i have to hand signal to them to move over.    The ultimate worst part of biking on MacArthur pkwy is the heat, it just does not give up and when you get to the coast guard station you have to hump it up and over."
Miami,3839v3,the_broccoli,2,Wed Jun 3 08:46:40 2015 UTC,"The worst part of South Florida in general, after the piss-poor urban planning, is the heat. We need to persuade the government or whoever to plant more trees.  The MacArthur causeway has a long stretch where the southern end of the causeway is next to very large rocks in the water, next to the bike lane. (Not sure if I'm describing this well; I've biked it a few times myself.) Those rocks are an excellent platform for mangrove trees. Mangroves are saltwater resistant, habitat-forming, and they prevent erosion and so will help hold the rocks, and the causeway, together. As they grow in height they will also provide shade for the bike lane. I don't know why they haven't put some mangrove trees along there already. If it's for the view, they could just put breaks at regular intervals so people can see the cruise ships."

Miami,3839v3,Musa15,5,Mon Jun 1 22:51:40 2015 UTC,"Love the bike lane that ends right before the last bridge of the Julia Tuttle causeway.  I'm going to file the JT as never going to ride.  100% unsafe and irresponsible to even suggest people ride on it.  The county had over a year to prepare for the closing.  At a minimum, signs should have been placed on both causeways alerting drivers of the increased numbers of cyclists because of the closure.  Also, some sort of temporary barrier should have been planned for the MacArthur, which I see as the better of two evils.    Overall, I give the county a 'F' for preparation and accommodation of cyclists.  Frankly they are also responsible for anyone injured during this time."
Miami,3839v3,the_broccoli,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:45:03 2015 UTC,"What money are they supposed to use to accommodate cyclists?  Motorists pay for road improvements through gas taxes, cyclists use the bike lane on those roads free of charge already."

Usually cops protect their own and he would get some leave time if he shot your dogs, but I am sure many will see this cop as just having killed 2 cops. I am not sure if he will be protected because he is a cop, or if he will be seen as a traitor for being a cop killer.  Cops are usually really close with their K9s. This article is loose on the details but I bet this guy is really fucked up by killing a close friend. Whatever happens, it's a terrible story."

Miami,3831kc,g_chillin,9,Wed Jun 3 02:09:21 2015 UTC,"Kendall isn't a horrible place, but it has a few big problems which is why I suspect people tend to hate on it:  1) Traffic - Traffic is frustrating and slow. This is basically having one of the big city disadvantages without the advantages. 2) Far from everything fun. - When you combine this with #1, you get to the point where you might feel like going out but don't because you don't want to deal with the horrible traffic. 3) If you like to go out drinking it's even worse - You have to drive to get anywhere, but can't drink and drive. Well, shouldn't. I know some people do; that's totally not cool.  East Kendall isn't too bad because you have the Metrorail nearby, but anywhere else in Kendall is just lousy if you like the city life. Now, if you like the quiet suburban lifestyle, Kendall can be awesome. Except for the traffic of course. We all hate that. :)"

Miami,3831kc,MasterPo23,2,Tue Jun 2 21:25:31 2015 UTC,Yeah I just don't get it. It's like because everything major is 30 or mins away it's like the city is garbage to them.
Miami,3831kc,g_chillin,4,Mon Jun 1 14:50:11 2015 UTC,"The two biggest reasons involve the sprawling nature of Kendall's layout (which offers little by way of unique opportunities compared to other areas), and the fact that most people have to traverse either 826 or 836 at some point to get there (where nightmare inducing traffic is commonplace).  Some other comment said it's only 30 mins from everything. and that's the issue. Ain't nobody got time for that. If you had a commute 30 mins each way that's 5 hours a week (and I would consider 30 mins from any business center Kendall to be light).  I live on the Beach. It's quiet during the week, plenty to see on the weekends, easy 10 min commute to Midtown, or 15 to Downtown. Water views both directions and you're usually going against traffic. Plus, most everything is close. You can walk or take a bike to anywhere local quickly and Uber if you're sauced for less than $8.   The one thing going for Kendall, however, is that it's not Broward!

The beach is what people consider the place to be in Miami, and anywhere else is normally viewed as boring and completely out of the way and not Miami proper.  Kendall is just the suburbs. Anybody else living in Broward is talking mad shit, there's literally the same monotonous bullshit to do there as there is to do down here. Party scene is at the beach. Anywhere else is basically the same. Unless you live in a nice area like the Gables or Cutler Bay. Then everything changes once you head north from Broward, it becomes diet-Georgia.

And guess what? The people voted in favor of it. So now I'm going to call it what it is every chance I get to remind people of how stupid and shallow we can be."
Miami,3831kc,MG87,1 point,Wed Jun 3 10:10:46 2015 UTC,"The people didn't vote, though. This kind of bullshit only passes because of low voter turnout - the same thing that put Rick Scott in office a second time. Call Dade County by its real name."

Very few options for a good cocktail/coffee. Once people get home they don't really want to go through traffic again.

Miami,3831kc,platypocalypse,4,Mon Jun 1 15:15:24 2015 UTC,"except that miami-dade county was renamed during our lifetime and should give some perspective to the many areas that have, for decades, informally been known as 'miami'.  south florida is a lot more like LA County in our breakdown than we are like the counties within NYC."
Miami,3831kc,thtgyovrthr,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:33:16 2015 UTC,"Exactly! The LA comparison is definitely better than NY one. Not to mention Newark is in another state from NYC lol Kendall is as much Miami as Brooklyn is a part of NYC   Ppl that live in Kendall, have Miami, Fl in their address not Kendall, FL lol  Before being split into all these neighborhoods it was just Miami."
Miami,3831kc,platypocalypse,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:35:05 2015 UTC,"That is incorrect, though. First of all, none of Dade was ever Miami except Miami. Corrupt politicians in 1997 tried to push all of Dade into Miami with the renaming, but it was never accepted by the majority of residents and only passed due to low voter turnout, and now it's an uphill battle for the residents of Dade to fix it. The same forces in Broward tried to do it there, too - to rename it ""Fort Lauderdale County"" - but Broward is not Fort Lauderdale just like Dade is not Miami, and fortunately for them they fought back and won.  Kendall and Brooklyn is a bad comparaison. Brooklyn is a borough which is located inside of - and is therefore part of - New York City. Kendall is unincorporated land which is outside of - and separate from - Miami. A better comparison would be San Diego and Tijuana, two separate cities. But Kendall is not a city, it is a neighborhood in unincorporated Dade County.  Also, what your mail says is irrelevant, as long as the zip code is correct. You could write anything - ""Miami,"" ""New Zealand,"" ""Uranus"" - as a placeholder for the city, and the mail will get there. Try it yourself."
Miami,3831kc,TunaNugget,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:08:19 2015 UTC,"The renaming is well-known as a corrupt move designed to convince people that parts of South Florida which aren't in Miami are in Miami.  Miami ends at Miami's borders. Everyone else is in a different city, or in unincorporated Dade."
Miami,3831kc,ineedawapon,2,Wed Jun 3 01:49:17 2015 UTC,"and everyone from outside of miami proper has been putting 'miami' on their mail for decades and the post office knew just what to do with it.  there are parts of the country that are more territorial, but when the city itself is a little over 100 years old, it's really just a silly attitude.    i grew in unincorporated miami-dade, attended schools in aventura, opa locka, norwood, and downtown.  and it was all the same transit, the same county government, policed by the same force [aside each jurisdiction's own smaller department], and boasted the same area code [before the cell phones brought along the 786].  i have family and close friends in all the aforementioned areas as well as coral gables, kendall, homestead, hialeah, miami shores, miami springs, miami lakes, north miami, south miami, north miami beach, and we all claim miami.  there's something to be said for the unique qualities of each area, but it's not really until the obnoxious highrises started going up in downtown miami that this new ""us/them"" business seems to have started rearing its head.  before that it was relegated to the folks of aventura, doral, and other similar areas that wanted to be known as their own city, as if anyone would recognize it north of broward county.  the renaming reflects what most of us already knew."
Miami,3831kc,ineedawapon,0,Wed Jun 3 03:25:14 2015 UTC,"That's all totally irrelevant to Dade County's location. If you grew up in unincorporated Dade before 786 - which, if I remember correctly, came around 1998 - then you grew up in Dade County, the ""Miami-Dade"" bullshit wasn't slapped on the county's name until 1997. Having friends and family in other Dade County cities does not put any one of them in Miami, even if residents of those cities are too lazy, ignorant, or ashamed to recognize that they are Dade County. There is no reason to be ashamed of being from Dade County. It is a diverse county with thirty-three unique cities, towns, and villages, plus unincorporated areas which are not in any city. People from other parts of Dade County should be proud of this.  Mail gets to where it's going as long as the zip code is correct, it doesn't matter what you write for the city. Try it yourself. That is why mislabeled mail that says ""Miami"" always gets to its destination.  People north of Broward already have a hard enough time understanding the geography of Dade County. The name change makes it even more difficult, because obnoxious idiots can go, ""Haha, maybe we're not Miami but we're still Miami-Dade County hahahahaha!"" No. You aren't in Miami, and it is called Dade County. Recognize the merits of your own city, and stop trying to say you are somewhere you're not. It's like being in New Jersey and claiming that you are in New York. There is no reason for it.  Each city needs to focus on developing its own downtown area to combat the sprawl and traffic. Having thirty-two unrelated cities totally dependent on Miami is one of the major problems with this county. There is a downtown in each city, it's fairly easy to find. Downtown North Miami Beach is 163rd. Downtown North Miami is 125th. Downtown Miami Shores is around 6th Avenue and is recognizable. Downtown Aventura is the area around the mall. Downtown Miami Springs is that circle area.  The renaming takes a bad idea and shoves it down the throats of all the people in Dade County, whether they live in Miami or not."

Miami,3831kc,veruus,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:22:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is just it. People move to the suburbs to escape the stress and horrible traffic.  Kendall has all the disadvantages of a big city (noise, heavy traffic) without any of the advantages. Like I said in another post, it's not horrible, but it's not great either.   Personally I live north of Kendall along Coral Way and primarily stay here because I work at FIU which is a 10 minute drive away. It's pretty much the same as living in Kendall. If I had to commute downtown, etc., I'd move in a heartbeat. :)"

Usually if you go with people over 21, chances of you getting IDed are slim but that also depends on the bar tender. The Grove has Green Street and that's usually where all the young people go. You can also try going with a friend who is 21. Some places allow for more than 1 drink per ID so they can probably sneak you a drink if you really want to hang with that crowd. But honestly, I turned 21 about 2 years ago and all I can tell you is to chill and enjoy your pre-21 years.  It'll come one day!   Shit gets real and time flies after 21!  Ninja Edit: just in case you wanna go clubbing, Space usually has nights that are 18+ and there are also music events that are 18+, but imo only go here if you know it's 18+ and are desperate to meet people.

We've (buddies and I) seen peacock, catfish, bass, lady fish... but haven't been out fishing canals in years. We've also caught snook up in Davie off Griffin road canals (Orange Drive is the parallel side road with canal access), and we didn't catch but saw huge snook in the canal next to the bass pro in Dolphin Mall. Also, we've seen a lot of non natives in the canals in west Doral: Mayan Ciclid, tilapia, jaguar guapote, and also plenty of carp, and variety of sunfish.   We've had plenty of success with plastic worms for bass (Texas-rigged), and hard swim baits and lures for peaks, especially the baits colored like peaks for when you spot them bedding.

Amtrak takes a couple hours longer (about 5 total) but costs less than half the price per coach ticket ($43 vs $94), not to mention low-cost plane tickets that take almost no time and the fact that driving tends to be a much cheaper option. I fully support mass transit options to get cars off the road but, at those prices, it won't be worth it for a lot of people."

Miami,37r8jw,aCause4Concern,14,Fri May 29 19:55:05 2015 UTC,I think All Aboard will be appealing to tourists who aren't renting cars. As locals it's easy to forget that the tourism industry represents 23% of sales tax. 100 million tourists come to Florida each year. There's a huge demand among tourists for better mass transit. If you go on Tri-Rail you'll see that tourists make up a decent amount of the riders.
Miami,37r8jw,miamigregory,5,Fri May 29 20:23:52 2015 UTC,"You're right, and/but I think All Aboard's  missing out on a lot of Miamians who are ready to skip the turnpike trip to Orlando. I guess it's a business decision that makes sense to them, but as a resident I had higher hopes."
Miami,37r8jw,Lolaindisguise,2,Fri May 29 20:14:17 2015 UTC,Agreed. Just the other day on here there was a post from a tourist enquiring about what to see along his or her tri-rail journey
Miami,37r8jw,miamigregory,2,Fri May 29 20:28:25 2015 UTC,Yea but residents should get a discount then that's a little steep

Those tickets from Orlando to West Palm Beach, Lauderdale, and Miami will run $66, $83, and $94."" Still not cheap, but you overstated the price most people will pay by $50%."
Miami,37r8jw,jennysbox,-1,Sat May 30 12:49:05 2015 UTC,Compare to the cost of a coach Amtrak ticket to basically anywhere. I can fly (less than an hour) for $30 more.
Miami,37r8jw,thrella,4,Fri May 29 20:02:36 2015 UTC,All Aboard is a luxury service and isn't really comparable to the existing Amtrak service in Florida.
Miami,37r8jw,jennysbox,-2,Fri May 29 20:05:34 2015 UTC,"There is absolutely zero information about what their coach service will be like. They don't advertise themselves as a luxury service. They advertise as having competitive pricing, Amtrak is the only viable competition.   Also, the Amtrak service in Miami (that runs to Orlando) is the same line that runs up the entire east coast to New York City. Coach seats are something like this."
Miami,37r8jw,catmoon,-4,Fri May 29 20:44:19 2015 UTC,Competitive with non-rail modes. Amtrak is a run-down slum on rails.
Miami,37r8jw,jennysbox,2,Fri May 29 21:01:33 2015 UTC,"No.  No it's not. Unless suddenly ""marginally poor"" means you live in a 4 room house in Miami and ""destitute"" means you drive a 2015 model Honda.  But then, can I haz money since you have boatloads of it, clearly? Thanks -.-"

More than anything, I want better mass transit as it would be better for the environment but trains running with no one on them doesn't really do that.  This project, at the costs mentioned in the article, is not a viable alternative to anything that exists. It would become the most expensive way to get to Orlando and, with the number of trains they plan on running, will have a negative long-term environmental impact if people aren't filling the cars at all ticket price points. The environmental impact numbers they are using assume that people will use the train rather than drive and for that to be the case, it needs to be cost effective for tourists and locals alike. $94 for a coach ticket, combined with the response to these numbers (finally) being released isn't really awe-inspiring.  My biggest concern is that the failure of AAF would mean that wouldn't see any improvement to rail infrastructure in other cases because it would be used as an example of it not being viable.  Edit: I just looked it up in the EIS. The break even number of GHG emissions alone is 344 cars per day."

Miami,37r8jw,beniceorbevice,-1,Fri May 29 22:27:32 2015 UTC,Depends on the size of the group. For a family of 5 a car rental might still cost less.
Miami,37r8jw,frogjizz,1 point,Fri May 29 22:29:52 2015 UTC,"I would suspect that rail isn't a viable transit mode in the majority of the US if you're using a monetary value to determine whether or not it's viable (and that's coming from a huge proponent of rail). Either it costs the end user a whole lot of money or it costs the provider (usually a government entity) a whole lot of money. That said, if the $94 is a round trip price for a coach seat I'd definitely do it. It costs me $80 to drive my car (not including wear and tear and the stress of dealing with stupid people on the highway for 3 hours) up to Orlando. If I could pass on that in favor of rail transit I'd pay $94 in a heartbeat.   That said, $11 isn't bad to get from Fort Lauderdale to Miami until Tri-Rail Coastal Link is up and running. Definitely not a replacement for the daily commute at that price point though. Either way, give it time -- the stations aren't even going vertical yet. Things can still change and we don't know the actual ticket costs yet."
Miami,37r8jw,the_broccoli,1 point,Fri May 29 22:38:08 2015 UTC,$94 is one way.  It gets you to the airport in Orlando.  What are you going to do then?  Take the 45 minute shuttle to the parks?  Rent a car?  And does anyone drive to Disney by themselves?  A car can fit multiple people for the same prices.  A Greyhound ticket to Orlando is ~$50.  A FLIGHT is barely more expensive.

Miami,37r8jw,stolenrobotgorilla,3,Sun May 31 01:26:58 2015 UTC,I think this is something that is not really understood by the Disney crowd. Many large companies are based in the Orlando area and do almost daily business in Miami with frequent drives between accounts in Orlando and South Florida. Those drives cost a lot of money and productivity. When your company is already expensing your rental car the cost of that ticket starts to look more appealing coupled with regaining 3 or 6 hours of productivity if you can work on the train.
Miami,37r8jw,catmoon,2,Sun May 31 02:03:59 2015 UTC,"Exactly. As a lawyer in South Florida, people from my firm are in Orlando constantly. I suspect that we will be utilizing this train quite frequently once it's up and running."

Miami,37ntkt,phelonious_monk305,6,Fri May 29 03:12:56 2015 UTC,I've been waiting for this for at least a year

Miami,37ntkt,MG87,11,Fri May 29 03:32:18 2015 UTC,"It's a documentary about a cop who got struck by lightning and bit by a cobra and became Kung Fury, the legendary warrior of prophecy. His nemesis is Hitler, and his partner is Triceracop.  Bar a few things (everyone knows Laser raptors were brought to extinction by George Washington's ghost 130 years ago, duh), seems pretty historically accurate, but you can't expect them to keep every detail correct, they have to make entertainment for the sake of entertainment.   You have to brush up on your recent history, bud."

Miami,37qddw,squall24,-1,Fri May 29 16:30:38 2015 UTC,Reducing/eliminating car traffic on the Mile would be nice IMHO. Lincoln Road does just fine like this. Bike lanes are a great idea for pedestrian and biker safety overall. Hope they could include some bike racks too(the Grove has some nice examples).
Miami,37qddw,aCause4Concern,-2,Fri May 29 18:01:08 2015 UTC,Sure there would be growing pains but I think 'the Mile' would ultimately benefit more as a destination rather than a road.

Miami,37i5b2,spooky-funk,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:36:23 2015 UTC,"I own a yacht charter company.  The US coast guard allows 12 people per boat max no matter what size the boat is.

Miami,37i5b2,jbatty74,2,Thu May 28 01:44:58 2015 UTC,From someone who's never been on a boat before (except ferries) that just sounds weird..No matter what size the boat is?? Even if you have your own huge yacht like ones all around Miami..?
Miami,37i5b2,beniceorbevice,4,Thu May 28 02:30:25 2015 UTC,Please see my response lower in the thread. That may clear up some confusion.
Miami,37i5b2,jbatty74,2,Thu May 28 10:30:19 2015 UTC,Yea...that 12 people max sounds weird. I would love to see a link for that. I've seen yatchs out there with more than 12 people when I go out on my own boat.
Miami,37i5b2,ThePutana,5,Thu May 28 03:46:46 2015 UTC,"To respond to both of you, I have been doing this for many years. And let me tell you, if your chartered vessel gets boarded with more than 12 passengers, you're going to have a bad time.  Here is a link to the pamphlet the USCG uses as a guide and hand out: http://www.uscg.mil/d7/sectMiami/pdf/CharterBrochure.pdf  There are a lot of definitions there but even in the first two paragraphs you can see 12 passengers is the magic number.  Remember, chartering a boat or yacht is very different than owning. Basically the only requirement of you own the vessel is life saving equipment, meaning you need a life jacket for each person on board."
Miami,37i5b2,jbatty74,1 point,Thu May 28 10:29:52 2015 UTC,So how do they get away with the weddings/events on the bay in huge boats with over 100 heads???
Miami,37i5b2,ManBroDudeGuy,3,Thu May 28 11:33:32 2015 UTC,"Those aren't private luxury boats.  There are only a few companies that have that commercial capacity.  Biscayne lady, Venetian lady, winridge k, and midnight sun.  They hold 149 people on average I think one holds 250. Those boats are empty rooms with banquet seating.  You cannot swim or do any water activities.    Sounds like op wanted a private luxury yacht such as a searay, Sunseeker,  azimut, lazarra etc.  I have boats up to 130 feet and still the uscg only allows 12 guests"
Miami,37i5b2,jbatty74,1 point,Thu May 28 11:39:30 2015 UTC,You know your ish!  12 people on a 130' boat is not going to fulfill my rap video dreams...  If I'm paying that kind of money I'm going to need far more than 11 girls on my boat.
Miami,37i5b2,ManBroDudeGuy,2,Thu May 28 11:43:25 2015 UTC,"Ive done numerous videos on our boats.  I get the same sad reaction from the rappers and then it turns to anger.    I think the law is archaic, it was designed for boats back in the 1930's made of wood and would sink if you blew on them to hard.  Modern boats have come a long way in terms of safety.  I tried bringing this law to court, but the USCG has a lot more firepower than my small business"

The neighborhood has a history as Wynwood that is longer than it's current reputation.  But yeah, the fashion district has been home to importers for a while and a lot of them have stuck around, although that seems to be changing. As to the quality, it is what it is. You can find some stuff that is great and will last a while and stuff that's pretty awfully made. You probably aren't going to get name brand stuff, good quality or not. The warehouses tend to be between 2nd and 5th with stores along 5th that sell the goods."

I'm not in the area anymore but I'm a host where I live now, and have also used the site for my own dogs. It's awesome and is almost always cheaper (and nicer) than using a doggy hotel!  If you'd like to check out an example, you can see mine - if you sign up through that link it'll give you $10 off your first booking (and $10 to me as well - just want to give that disclaimer!) no matter who you book with, so you could find someone in Miami. :)"

They have a DVM on call all night and i think 2 vet techs on premises all night so the dogs are never alone. They do check ups before you pick up your dog and they found a tumor in one of my dogs ears a few years back. Very thorough and very nice staff. My dogs always leave happy.

Not many people around here do despite having such a rich cultural history even before the arrival of the Latin American community. Not really a book but I've put a link to the major journal of South Florida history, Tequesta. The website has all the articles ever published from 1941-2003 free (you have to pay for the articles published from 2003-present). Scholars have been doing research on this area for quite some time. You can skim the articles or read them. They aren't too dense or difficult and usually no more than 25 pages.

The gut was pretty much blackmailed into the operation. The best part for me is when they do a car/money/coke swap at the Denny's and McDonald's on NW 67th ave. They parked the car by Denny's, then walked into the McDonald's bathroom and left the keys on one of the urinals for another guy to scoop and take off with.

Miami,378qxs,EastCoastinn,-1,Wed May 27 11:57:33 2015 UTC,MRW I thought about carpooling with you and then I checked the prices for the festival
Miami,378qxs,zewm426,0,Tue May 26 15:19:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah they're not cheap that's for sure. But I can't recommend it enough. I've been to coaches a few times and while I wouldn't say it's a life changing experience I'd say it's one you'll remember and cherish forever.   As far as this year's bonnaroo is concerned the lineup is just so incredible. There are easily more than 6 artist that I would pay 50 bucks divided act to see. On top of that it's an opportunity to see them all at a venue that is more Incredible than anything Miami has to offer. There's a reason music festivals have become part of the pop ethos again.   Off the top of my head without looking at the list, Billy Joel, kendrick lamar (coming off what to me will be three timeless hip hop records in a row, and the single greatest hip hop record since illmatic), deadmau5 for some big room dancing fun, d'angelo, Mumford n sons (while I know people are over exposed to them I want to see them live at least once), Alabama shakes, Odesza, run the jewels, tech the list is just incredible"
Miami,378qxs,zewm426,-3,Tue May 26 16:18:05 2015 UTC,I guess our music taste differs. I absolutely detest Kendrick and Mumford. The main headliners are not worth $350 + gas + food. The only artists on the lineup I would be interested to see are Childish Gambino and Deadmau5. The rest of the lineup is pretty meh for me.  I'm also an opponent of '420 friendly' and I've been to 4-day festivals before. I really don't think I would be missing much. But best of luck on your journey.
Miami,378qxs,zewm426,0,Tue May 26 16:43:03 2015 UTC,So you considered car pooling to see childish gambling and deadmau5 all the way to Tennessee with a stranger who made it clear they were doing drugs when you're opposed to drug culture? You're telling me that all that is true and that the price is the thing that drove you away?   Right...

No reef, but plenty of little coral pieces growing on the rocks and plenty of reef fish, parrot fish, barracuda etc.  Strong current at the end, waves can be rough (I can't imagine going w/o fins) must be strong to avoid being thrown into the rocks.  If that part is not enjoyable to you, then along the beach about 30 feet offshore snorkel the sandy bottom you will see yellow spotted moray eels swimming in and out of the piles of sea grass, plenty of Bahama stars, a few large conchs etc.  Bridge jumping is also good in the lower keys (near Geiger check tides).

Miami,36wxr5,avaldes1627,4,Sat May 23 16:52:06 2015 UTC,This place is within walking distance of where I live.  It is amazing. Don't feel like cooking? Just take a walk. Problem solved. :)
Miami,36wxr5,zorinlynx,10,Sat May 23 19:12:31 2015 UTC,"If you want a casual atmosphere and an a la carte style menu, check out Palacio De Los Jugos.  It's basically a place that's broken up into sections. One area for sandwiches, another for entres and sides, and finally an area with desserts (pasteles de guayaba). You pick and choose what you want and then they have an outdoor area with picnic style seats and a large tarp. You can either take the food to go or just sit at a table and grub away.  In my experience, an interesting aspect to this style of seating is that you can often share a table with a stranger and spark up conversations. The tables generally seat 6-8 people and if there is an open spot in your table and it's packed someone will probably ask to sit at the table.  There are no waiters, it's not like a restaurant where you are seated and brought food. You get everything you want inside and then eat at your convenience. They have a lot of stuff inside like fresh fruits and smoothies as well."
Miami,36wxr5,zewm426,1 point,Fri May 22 23:42:07 2015 UTC,I have to second this recommendation.  Keep in mind that they give you a LOT OF FREAKING FOOD. We're talking mountains of food in each portion. More than enough to split between two people unless you're a really big eater.
Miami,36wxr5,zorinlynx,1 point,Sat May 23 19:19:39 2015 UTC,The prices are pretty good for the enormous amount of food given! $12-15 if I recall.

Miami,36wxr5,captainajax,1 point,Sun May 24 01:21:10 2015 UTC,"Depends on which area you are in. AFAIK, the part with the food behind glass and desserts are just walk up to an empty space and wait for someone to attend you. Think of it like going to a bar. You just find a little hole and wait until there is a server that is not attending someone else.  For the sandwiches there is a line. Although the times I've gone it's not very organized, but it's there.  There is no real etiquette but I mean don't stand too far from the counter and wait on someone to see you. Lots of people are waiting for an order and will just stand around. If you blend in, they will assume you're just waiting. You have to assert yourself a bit. Don't be rude, but step up to the plate as it were."

Best croquettas in Miami.  For a quick Cuban bite you can go with a frita from El Rey de las Fritas or any sandwhich from Sarussi.   Any of these places can be found in quick google searches.

Miami,36ya2b,PromoteDave,7,Sat May 23 03:17:50 2015 UTC,"Have a realtor in the area print you a current rental listing with all available units on Miami Beach that fit your criteria. I say Miami Beach for 2 reasons. 1) the beach was your first thought and that's where it's at and 2) Wynwood is no more than 20 minute commute, maybe 30 in heavy traffic. A 10 minute phone call could get your wants and needs down to at least 10 great options.   The reason why you may consider this option is that most of the housing is unit/house investor owned and they list their rentals on the MLS/X system so they will only deal with licensed realtors. The owner of the property is the one who ends up paying the commission. It's IMO the safest way to go and you'll have access to the best options. Craigslist and rental websites are kind of a minefield and most likely you'll end up face to face with a realtor so why not have one on your side from the get-go.   Also it's worth mentioning with your budget you should be able to find a great place. Just take the steps to ensure everything is done correctly.   Pre-Welcome to our beautiful city. Grab some Panther Coffee when you get settled in Wynwood."
Miami,36ya2b,DaleCondale,3,Sat May 23 03:55:31 2015 UTC,"I second both of these thoughts.  Moved to Miami Beach from the Midwest on very short notice, and I would never have been able to find my place without using a realtor.   I work downtown and my girlfriend worked on the edge of Wynwood (she works downtown now), and we both have really easy commutes and wouldn't dream of living anywhere else.    If you have any intention of actually going to the beach, I would strongly suggest living here.  Not only is it an entirely different environment from downtown/Brickell (it's a beach town first and foremost, after all - you can walk anywhere and things are really relaxed), it's hot as hell here (Miami generally) and getting to the beach is an effort from anywhere except the beach.

As someone who grew up in Atlanta with freaknik and a similar crowd,  stereotypes exist for a reason.  It has nothing to do with race and everything to do with culture.  Similar to 'outlaw biker culture'  there exists a preference for violence,  debauchery,  attitude,  and drugs on urban beach weekend.   Last year I had a friend come down with a group of girls for a bachelorette party.  I warned them they may want to cancel but they thought they'd be fine since they were at fontainblue.  They actually called about cancelling their reservation and the hotel told them it was all exaggerated and they couldn't cancel.  Anyway,  they lasted less than 24 hours before walking away from 3 prepaid nights at the hotel and renting a car up to ft Lauderdale.  In those 24 hours there were relentlessly harassed by men,  more than just cat calling, aggressive in your face,  pushy.  A group of guys tried to follow them to their room and they had to call the cops to get them to stop following them, the final straw was a group of urban girls telling them this was black weekend,  to leave and then physically assaulting them on the street then yelling around that my friends group had dropped the n-word (they had  not)   Fuck this ignorant aggressive violent culture,  it has no place on civilized society."

Urban weekend is mostly concentrated on South Beach and really only during Memorial Day weekend.  Both events bring a ton of money to the city, though I'd be willing to bet WMC brings in more.

But how many college grads in New York can afford to rent by themselves on like the upper east side? This isn't unique to Miami. Every major city has more desireable neighborhoods and areas. Heck, he should be happy that as a college grad he's making 35k a year as the article says. Many of his fellow graduates are lucky to be making much less."
Miami,36sexf,phovendor54,7,Thu May 21 21:27:24 2015 UTC,Exactly... if he wants to live in Brickell he'll need to up his game. He could afford his own place in Miami but it's not going to be a penthouse. A studio or 1/bd in downtown Miami is reasonably priced around 1400- 1600 but that is going to be way more than 30-40% of his income a month.
Miami,36sexf,Krisrk,0,Thu May 21 22:08:15 2015 UTC,something that cost more than a months wage at minimum wage is not reasonable.
Miami,36sexf,icancut,1 point,Fri May 22 11:15:49 2015 UTC,"Sorry but your statement is not reasonable.   Florida has a minimum wage of $8.05 an hour. Lets assume you work full time or 40 hours a week. Multiple that by 52 weeks a year. You take and get no vacations.  $8.05 x 40 = $322.00 a week in gross income. 322 x 52 weeks is your annual gross income of $16,744   Divide that by 12  for a monthly gross income of $1,395.33 and of that money 30 percent can be allotted towards rent. So anything more than 418.60 a month is not reasonable to you.   Renting a room is about $500 a month. So that is not reasonable either. I'm sorry, but people who expect minimum wage to make it through life as a single person will have to live very frugal.   I am not trying to be rude or condescending but this is reality. If you have no bills and debts then perhaps a minimum wage income could support yourself but you'd still be living very frugal."
Miami,36sexf,Krisrk,2,Fri May 22 16:30:08 2015 UTC,It's not reasonable to expect to be able to rent when working 40+ hours a week?
Miami,36sexf,icancut,1 point,Fri May 22 16:47:16 2015 UTC,"You can't keep a straight argument. 1st you state that ""something that cost more than a months wage at minimum wage is not reasonable"".   My answer to that question was you are able to afford $418.60 a month on minimum wage with 30 percent towards rent.   Now you just flipped the script and state ""it's not reasonable to expect to be able to rent when working 40+ hours a week?""   That answer is yes it is absolutely reasonable. But you will be making more than 8 bucks an hour. If you aren't making more than that amount of money you'd better have a second job, potential third, roommates, significant other, or other sources of financial assistance. Or a combination of these options to afford a place that isn't in the ghetto because 418.60 a month won't get you a room in a home.   So please choose an argument, stick with it, and quick switching it up as you see fit to take blanket statements. Otherwise shut up. Because I'm not going to debate an idiot.  Please tell everyone here on Reddit about your job flipping burgers at McDonald's and how you are able to afford living in an above sub-par housing arrangement."

I've been trying to figure this out too, there's ONLY ONE place in Miami that you can do this through the government office and it's downtown, and there's NO documentation to be found any Fucking where on the internet as to what you need, and,  AND..get a load of this THEY DON'T HAVE A FUCKING PHONE # - so, you need to go downtown, I'm assuming wait in line for a few hours just to ask someone what exactly you need for this procedure, then go home and get it and come back the next day, again wait for hours.  I called two private tag agencies and they both said it'll be about 450$.  Also, you need the title and proof of insurance under your name, and proof that your father gave/sold it to you OP.  I just moved from nyc and I can't believe such a thing as the ""dmv"" doesn't exist in this entire state and all this shit I have to go thru to get my car registered here, but yet Florida state says you have only 10 days to register your car lol"
Miami,36rd07,beniceorbevice,4,Fri May 22 02:36:26 2015 UTC,Go to the dmv it's not rocket science. Just make sure you bring all the documents. I haven't helped people buy cars off craigslist 6 times. You just hand them A bill of sale the signed over title and your dl and insurance.  If it's an out of state car make sure you get the odometer read by a notary.

Do a little googling ""transfer title Florida"" and you should get some info. But yes, I agree they make it really difficult to find the correct info.

Miami,36itix,Motchka,6,Wed May 20 19:07:06 2015 UTC,Time to give up on this. They want to be in the heart of the city but there's no room and the land is too expensive. Plus the residents don't want to deal with the added traffic.
Miami,36itix,Miamime,2,Wed May 20 11:44:55 2015 UTC,"Marlins Stadium would be nice. Just rename it to something generic (or company-based name), remove that god awful sculpture, and we'd be good."

Miami,36itix,invisiblewar,1 point,Fri May 22 11:42:02 2015 UTC,"Would there be that much more traffic? I'd love this to get built downtown - I'm Scottish and the culture in Europe is to go for a few beers before the game - I'm more than happy to get public transport / uber and have a few pints and not drive. I know about tailgating in US sports, would that be a thing with football?"
Miami,36itix,hairycarpetmonster,0,Wed May 20 17:21:37 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Traffic downtown is horrible on certain days. I live right near bayfront and If there is a heat game and it's rush hour, traffic doesn't move to the point where I can't get to my apt from the 95 exit and it's like .2 miles. Then there are those days when multiple events are scheduled at once and it's an absolute cluster. Plus you have days where it rains so bad biscayne floods. Now consider these situations with another 20,000 people coming to watch a soccer game. Absolute nightmare. We just don't have the public transportation system to support so many things going on in downtown."

I'm not sure if the Palms at Town & Country were already built when you left but the whole shopping mall was renovated and is very busy. There are now a lot of good eating options in Kendall and Dadeland Mall is surrounded by construction. Further north, South Miami now has great night life. I'm not sure what it was like back in 2007 but I can't imagine it was this popular. The one thing you aren't missing is the traffic, which has only gotten worse and the tolls, which are on practically every highway these days."
Miami,36jmfd,RogerMexico,3,Wed May 20 02:38:21 2015 UTC,How about..what was it called...the Falls? There was a mall like that with expanses of waterfalls in the middle.  That's where my family and I use to frequent.
Miami,36jmfd,sirmonkey95,6,Wed May 20 04:04:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah right next to US1. The movie theater there is still up and running. You have some music shows certain nights. There is now big store for American Girl dolls there. A Hagen Daz and There is also a Crepe store that use to be just a stand. You still have Hot Topic, Gamestop, Build-a-bear, Johnny Rockets, Starbucks, and Brookstone there too"

I can't remember about the others.  Edit: I remember when that creme store was just a stand too, it was so awesome to go, I use to go on Sunday afternoons with my Dad and best friend ^"
Miami,36jmfd,sirmonkey95,4,Wed May 20 05:07:33 2015 UTC,Brook Stone is that cool electronic store. It has been there for a long time. I remember just going in there playing with the cool things. Unfortunately the discovery store didn't last long there. I has been a long time since it was closed but I still remember that being my favorite store there.
Miami,36jmfd,sirmonkey95,2,Wed May 20 05:21:54 2015 UTC,I remember the Discovery store vaguely...I also remember there was an Apple store there...is there still?
Miami,36jmfd,wtfisdisreal,3,Wed May 20 05:33:14 2015 UTC,Of Course the Apple Store is still there. Also that place has lines snaking around the whole mall when a new iPhone releases.
Miami,36jmfd,Dirtydirtysouth305,2,Wed May 20 05:40:27 2015 UTC,Figures. How about that Dave N Busters in...was it...Sunset? The one by the malt shop.
Miami,36jmfd,MirabilisSum,2,Wed May 20 06:16:03 2015 UTC,The gaming place in Sunset is Gameworks (well now it is called GameTime) Dave N' Busters is in Dolphin Mall. The Bass Pro Shot is still at Dolphin too. So is Strike Miami and the Move Theater. FYI closed shop there and there is now a new IKEA at Dolphin.

And worst of all, The youth fair is getting kicked off of FIU property.   Other than that... Same wonderfully crazy people in the same wonderful crazy city sweating our asses off.   Oh! And you can take the metrorail to the airport now which is super fantastic."

Miami,36jmfd,wtfisdisreal,0,Tue May 19 22:04:51 2015 UTC,"Not really. The traffic has been impossible since I was a kid.  I think the emergence of local downtowns, like South Miami and Coral Gables, has spread it out some so it only gets to a certain level of intolerable."
Miami,36jmfd,XplosivWaffles,4,Wed May 20 04:38:13 2015 UTC,I moved here from Miami in 2008. I do love my home town. I visit at least twice a year and that is enough to remind me why I left.
Miami,36jmfd,ewwruby,2,Tue May 19 23:21:17 2015 UTC,"I moved to Miami six months ago and I love it. It's so cool and also beautiful! The trees and plants are amazing. I often wonder what it would have been like to grow up in what seems to me like a tropical paradise with its incredible banyan trees, jackfruits and wild iguanas. And the city is amazing. Best of both worlds. It's good to know that this a city worth missing."
Miami,36jmfd,ReluctantPawn,3,Tue May 19 23:24:32 2015 UTC,"You'll hear a lot of negativity, mostly from people who have never lived anywhere else.

I'd actually recommend Raymond Kimsey.  I don't have insurance either.  It's not cheap but he's very down to earth and does not try to make you pay for something you don't need.  The first time I went in, I thought I'd cracked a tooth and was expecting to have to pay for a crown.  Thankfully he had a much easier/cheaper solution.  Although he recommended I get x-rays, I was able to opt out of them.  I'm not sure about a cavity though so it may be best to call and ask."

Miami,36f74i,MobileKirill,1 point,Tue May 19 00:33:27 2015 UTC,"Do the Cuban people not know about the easing of the embargo? At this point it can't be long before they can just leave legally, can it?   Edit: Hell of a way to respond to an honest question folks."
Miami,36f74i,jpoRS,25,Tue May 19 03:31:01 2015 UTC,"No, that's probably why they're rushing now. If the embargo eases the wet foot / dry foot policy will likely be revoked. It's not like Cuba's going to suddenly end it's dictatorship so conditions on the island won't improve, but all of a sudden if you touch US soil you might still get deported.  The window of opportunity is likely closing, they'll have to rely on the lottery system for a visa afterwards."
Miami,36f74i,blo0p,6,Tue May 19 04:05:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for actually answering my stupid question. I hadn't thought of it regarding wet/dry, I was thinking more regarding the relaxation of travel restrictions a few years ago, and the easing of US restrictions. My thought was that they can't be far away from escape options that aren't as crazy as going to sea in that raft, so why raft?"
Miami,36f74i,jpoRS,7,Tue May 19 21:32:04 2015 UTC,"No problem, That wasn't a stupid question I'm surprised you were downvoted, It was probably on a lot of people's mind. Not everyone even knows that the wet foot / dry foot even exists.  I don't know what the current conditions are on the island outside of my family, and I haven't been there in over 10 years so my answer might not be entirely accurate...  The raft is because the visa lottery is incredibly rare, and even if you get it, you might not be able to go with your entire family, just one person who ends  up providing and sending money back.  Sure some people can miraculously save up the money to ""Take a vacation in panama"" and then fly from panama over to Miami etc..   But most people are incredibly poor, Last I was there (2003) an american dollar was worth 28 Pesos. My Uncle is a Systems Administrator in Cuba (Not a lot of people ever get to work with computers over there) and all he makes is the equivalent of $30 Dollars a Month. This is actually a well paid position over there, so you can imagine it'd be hard for most people to have the funds to actually get out.   The other obvious answer would be to take an actual boat, but unless you actually live on the coast or are a fisherman you probably don't have access to a boat. Think of how many people in Miami actually have access to a boat, then you have to find people who both have a boat and want to escape to the US. There's also the logistics of launching the boat from an  inconspicuous area so that you don't get caught on the island (where you might be killed) or so you don't get caught by coast guard before you touch land.   There is an alternative to both the Visa and Raft route but it's expensive. It's the same route that Mexicans sometimes use to cross the border: Smuggling. Smuggling is actually a lucrative business in Miami, A person who owns a boat loans it to the smugglers for give or take 10k, the smugglers sneak into Cuba and come back with an arranged party (usually between 8-20 people) each of those are charged 10k (again not exactly cheap to most Cubans). It's dangerous, the smugglers will face jail time as if they were smuggling cocaine and the coast guard is totally aware of this. If you're ever out fishing by the keys the coast guard might come up and see if everyone can speak English, if they can't they'll keep prying.   Source on that last part: dumbass Step-dad lent boat out to Cuban smugglers, Cuban smugglers stole boat, boat is now somewhere off the coast of Colombia. Lesson learnt"

Miami,36f74i,Maicolombia,3,Mon May 25 06:32:54 2015 UTC,"Bear in mind, too, that under the Cuban Adjustment Act, Cuban refugees are entitled to automatic government benefits that few, if any, immigrants enjoy upon their arrival in the US.  If that act is repealed, they will no longer qualify for the generous material support they receive upon arrival.  So, there's probably some added urgency in anticipation of its repeal.  Edit:  Removed quotes around ""refugees"" because I deemed them to be rude."

Again, genuine lack of knowledge on my part that I'm trying to address. Not just being shitty to be shitty."
Miami,36f74i,jpoRS,3,Fri May 22 01:19:48 2015 UTC,The benefits are part of the Cubans' refugee status - just like folks from many other countries get.
Miami,36f74i,tillandsia,0,Fri May 22 14:45:47 2015 UTC,"Remember that our policy toward Cuba was put in place during the Cold War, when we deemed it in our national interest to thwart the spread of Communism.  A Communist dictatorship being set up in our own back yard was considered a serious affront, and we opened up the doors to dissident Cubans as a way of sticking it to Castro, and to allow his political opponents to escape almost certain persecution.    These days, however, many migrants arrive, get set up with their government benefits, then immediately request visitation privileges to the island.  Not only is visitation to Cuba an opportunity enjoyed only by these few (most other Americans are not allowed), but it makes one wonder just how fearful they are of persecution when they want to turn around and visit after seeking refuge here.  Our policy is in dire need of revision, I think."

Miami,36hay2,SurlyDuffBeer,3,Tue May 19 19:54:08 2015 UTC,"I was an Uber driver for some time. I made the best money on nights with events going on. Halloween was my best. Made a few hundred dollars in just 4 or 5 hours, but the traffic sucked. I drove a few times on regular week days and i probably made about 50 bucks. Idk, I stopped doing it because there was nothing really going on for some time. Weekend nights are pretty good, too. It can be worth it, but take into consideration all the wear-and-tear on your car, gas, mileage, waiting around for people, and driving in traffic often. It got pretty annoying to me. Meeting cool out-of-towners is fun, though. So I guess it depends on your availability and how tolerant you can be of others."

Miami,363m67,apostrophie,2,Sat May 16 03:00:59 2015 UTC,I haven't lived in NYC for over 10 years but back then the brunch scene was spectacular. Also very budget friendly. Almost every restaurant ran a special where your brunch included coffee and 1 alcoholic beverage.  Motherfucking 7A and pretty much every restaurant in the east village offered a complete brunch package for under $12. The brunch scene here has picked up a lot in the past three years but it's not a deal usually. Brunch for two in Miami usually sets me back  $80 to $100.

In MIA, Bagatelle, Cantina La Veinte (which is a real scene), La Mar at the Mandarin Oriental, Bianca at the Delano, Nikki Beach (a real party), Le Glutonniere (buffet), Juvia (new buffet brunch, spectacular food, spectacular views) and Beachcraft (Tom Colicchios place that just opened). Nothing is as crazy as Lavo or Bagatelle in NYC but for party brunches you can find those, for high end (i.e. expensive) you have some (Biltmore Brunch being the grand daddy), and for inexpensive I always like the Big Tomato in Pines, Casa Romeo and a few others that are ""bueno, bonito and barato"" (good,pretty, and cheap)"

Miami,35zf8u,ryan10000max,8,Thu May 14 20:18:26 2015 UTC,I wonder if there was this kind of backlash when Times Square in NYC started going digital with their billboards. I think its going to be an either love it or hate it sort of thing with no middle ground in between.
Miami,35zf8u,raulness,1 point,Thu May 14 22:16:06 2015 UTC,"I think a big part is the feeling that Times Square sort of ""happened"" where this is going to go from nothing to complete in two or three years. New York has history, or at least the perception of history. Miami is still such a young city that the things that sort of ""happened"" here (Lincoln Road is a good example) are still evolving. Hell, the Art Deco District is iconic and absolutely defines Miami Beach and it was done by what was practically a single developer all around the same time.   The fact that we have a habit of tearing down things that would eventually become history (cough cough MiMo architecture cough cough) because they're old and outdated doesn't really help this perception."

You can find a studio in several parts of the city for around $800, so unless you are really into having a roommate, you might want to shop around.  Areas for consideration:   West Little Havana (from 27th Avenue to 37th Avenue, between Flagler and SW 8th Street) Coral Way (The area around SW 24th Street, between 12th Ave and 37th Ave)   A lot of people will rent out second structures on their properties and you can get some great places like that.

Its the same course offered in the performance driving center in spartanburg with the biggest difference being that they brought out M3s and M4s for you to drive in. Normally to jump behind the seat of an M car it would cost 3.5K for the M School.

Miami,35s82u,backyardcountry,2,Wed May 13 14:18:09 2015 UTC,Cuban black tie attire dictates a guayabera with a black bow tie. It looks extra gangster too.  Get a Ramon Puig. It's worth it unless you know a good Cuban tailor... then get him to make you one.

The government does not choose the language you speak here, the people do.   So your saying: ""Isn't that what you do when you move to a new country, learn the language."" counters your own argument. Why haven't you learned Spanish? Hell, that's what the article was all about! The whole point of this post was to bring up how necessary it is to know Spanish in this microculture. And frankly, I don't see any negatives to being fluent in both languages be the norm.   Now, for the people you've mentioned, there are tons of others that try to communicate and understand. I'm sorry you've had a shitty experience with a few people, but all the people I know (family and friends) always try to teach the spanish language and culture to our nonhispanic friends.

Miami,35pqr6,DownsetWithNothing,-1,Tue May 12 20:47:06 2015 UTC,It would be pretty stupid of me to go to say China and get angry at people for not speaking English.   Try saying that in Hong Kong where everyone speaks English. China doesn't have Cuba and South America so close to it. Also China wasn't a former Spanish territory with a Spanish name.   Maybe it's not the language barrier maybe they are all just rude inconsiderate people.   Maybe they are just ignorant or past the age where learning a new language can be difficult.

Miami,35pqr6,josetavares,3,Tue May 12 16:17:06 2015 UTC,Miami is either a French or American Indian word.  By your argument we're wrong for not allowing them to speak Algonquin or French instead of English.  I'm not saying you don't have a point but the argument you made to support it is fail. Choose a better argument.

Earth is a Dutch/German word but it doesn't MEAN anything about what language we're supposed to speak. It's a stupid argument.   If you want to be literal, Florida is actually a Spanish (as in Spaniard) word. So our Spanish thoughd be pronouthed like thith. The argument that the name of a place means anything about its language fails there, too.  That's all I was trying to say, except I was trying to be good about producing a valid argument about it.   To quote you: You didn't read what I said."

Miami,35pqr6,ferveo,5,Tue May 12 20:09:49 2015 UTC,"Because it has more to do with new arrivals than with history, and generally doesn't have all that much to do with Cubans anymore.    Me and all of the first-generation Cuban-Americans that I grew up with spoke both English and Spanish just fine.  Generally, the parents spoke a little English, and the grandparents none at all.  Watch ""Que Pasa USA"" for the comedy potential.  But in Miami, new Spanish-speaking people keep coming, and for the most part not from Cuba anymore. But their kids go to public school, and all speak English, just like me and my friends did."

Miami,35p96g,bocaburger,8,Tue May 12 11:51:42 2015 UTC,"I'll provide the small amount of personal experience I can.  I've only ever had AT&T and Comcast. When I had AT&T, I lived in a small neighborhood at the very NW edge of Miami-Dade. The service from AT&T was mediocre at best. Stability wasn't the greatest, as whenever it was about to rain or while it was raining, the service would become intermittent as fuck (and it rains a lot here). But I do contribute the shitty service to the use of old above ground lines in that neighborhood. I'm guessing they hadn't undergone maintenance in a long time, and probably had some issues with shielding/insulation.  Since then I've moved to a nearby neighborhood where most of the lines are underground. We switched to Comcast when we got here, and I can say that as far as the quality of service it's night and day vs AT&T. Rarely does the internet go down, and my longest outage in 5-6 years has been a handful of hours. I've had one 2-hour outage in the past year. Consistency of speed is great. But if you go with Comcast, I recommend getting your own modem and wireless router, as their routers suck major ass. If you use their equipment, you'll also get charged an equipment fee of$10 a month for their router, which I should have replaced years ago and saved hundreds of dollars. Fuck me.  The way my bill is setup, I'm shown the cost of my bundle which includes TV/internet/phone, so I can't tell you exactly what I'm paying for internet. I do have 50Mbps, which is listed at $80 a month for standalone."

My only rant about DSL service is the shitty upload speeds. Although it's a bit better these days (45/6). I've also never run into any 'data cap' situations. Additionally I only have internet from them so I'm not sharing the connection bandwidth for digital cable. So I don't know how the performance would be with that combination.  I've never had any other ISP so I can't give a clear comparison. I can only offer you my experiences with my current ISP.

To be honest as long as you come in with your research done (look up the bluebook or equivalent value) and the dealer is able to answer questions about the car's history (and verify it) you should be ok. Be sure to get anything and everything they say in writing. If they hesitate to put something in writing or say ""don't worry about it, just sign here"", walk away.   Oh and go to the places that are decently sized. Seriously, the small places with only 10 cars tend to all be shit. When you find a car you like call a mechanic (seriously, there are thousands here in Miami) to come take a look at the car. They'll charge you between $50 and $100. If they give you the green light, you've already done all of your research and negotiation, so go ahead with the purchase.

Make sure they give you the bottom line out the door price with everything. Have them all fight with each other giving you a lower price until there's only one left. Don't be surprised if multiple dealerships are quoting the same exact car. It happens. Don't be afraid to walk away if you need to. If they ask for a penny more actually tell them to go fuck themselves.  You've already arranged your own financing so don't go for their financing (unless you want to of course. If your credit is good and they're offering 0%... well then). Say no to every value added package they offer (unless you really think it's necessary). Write the dealership with the lowest quote a check for the amount they quoted. You're kind of done at this point."
Miami,35o3t4,beniceorbevice,1 point,Tue May 12 04:40:24 2015 UTC,"To be honest buying a car that JUST came off a lease is a lot better option than buying a brand new car. Go to the Nissan dealerships and see what 2012 cars they have, you could get a beautiful maxima with ~30k miles for same price you'll end up paying for a new versa. Also go within the last 2/ 3 days of the month.   Edit: I just realized a versa is cheap af, so maybe not a maxima but probably an Altima that just came off lease. Buying a new car you're losing ~3~4000$ as soon as you sign the contract"
Miami,35o3t4,zewm426,1 point,Thu May 14 05:43:07 2015 UTC,"Good luck. Buying a car from a dealer is like negotiating world peace between two warring countries.  Also, they aren't asking the manager shit, they are just hiding for a few minutes and then coming back to say no. It's a war of attrition.  Lastly, don't be afraid to say no or walk away if the deal doesn't suit you. I'm a very impulsive buyer and usually end up making terrible decisions when purchasing vehicles because I never say no. I've ended up overpaying on two motorcycles that required more repairs than I anticipated because I didn't just walk away."

Miami,35lr0q,Sour_deezy,1 point,Mon May 11 20:20:07 2015 UTC,The Federal Food & Wine has great brunches.  They're similar to Eating House though.  Another fun thing to do would be on of the drag queen brunches on South Beach.  The Palace is a popular one if I recall

Love sports, NFL, NBA, Soccer, etc. I want to start playing Golf and Tennis more regularly.  I love TV although I don't watch it as much as I want- favorite shows: Arrested Development, Seinfeld, Curb, Silicon Valley, Veep, Scrubs, Sunny and a bunch more.  hmmmm.... i should probably tell you more roommate centric stuff  I'm pretty chill- open to any kind of roommate. I'm clean but not a neat freak. I probably will be spending minimal time in the apartment because i'll be working a lot. Love pets and I'm pretty considerate (I wont try to force myself into a threesome and I won't stab you while you're shitting). Oh! Also, i'm a dude but I don't care who I live with.

Miami,35i0cf,just-a-quick-Q,7,Sun May 10 15:53:44 2015 UTC,I live in homestead near Campbell Dr. There has been a lot of development in the area and is not as bad as some of these people are saying. There are some places that or worse then others off course though. You can definitely find something in that price range or better/less. Although if I had the choice to move closer to Kendall or cutler ridge I would take it
Miami,35i0cf,Aldo1028,11,Sun May 10 21:58:49 2015 UTC,"My advice, don't move to homestead.  In all seriousness, there are good and bad parts of the city. Try driving around the neighborhoods during the day AND at night to see what areas you can see yourself living in. Have you reached out to local realtors to see what they suggest?"
Miami,35i0cf,ReallyFatPeopleOnTLC,2,Sun May 10 21:45:57 2015 UTC,"go to cutler ridge where the rent is cheap and everythings a little more spread out. homestead is okay in most places, just very busy and crowded with high car insurance."
Miami,35i0cf,dudeabides87,2,Sun May 10 22:12:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it depends on what side of the turnpike you are on.  I would consider a gated community, there are lots.  Keys Gate comes to mind.  As well, when you are apartment hunting, there are so many low income apartments.  If they are renting with a 99$ for first months rent, avoid at all cost!  Homestead is heavily populated with migrants because it's also a farming community.  Schools are horrific, as well as crime.    Population: 62,785 Annual Crimes Per 1,000 Residents Violent Crimes: 16.64 per 1,000 residents Property Crimes: 51.22 per 1,000 residents Total Reported Crimes: 67.87 per 1,000 residents  Homestead has a crime rate of about 68 per one thousand residents.  Your chance of becoming a victim of a crime in Homestead? One in 15.  Homestead‚Äôs ranking when considering only violent crimes? #1  This is from 2012 FBI  I don't know where you are coming from hun but it is extremely culturally diverse.  Hatains, Cubans, Jamacains, Mexicans, you name it!  They all hate each other.  I get very nervous when I have to go to Homestead and always carry.  Peek around in the Redlands.  There are some very wealthy and middle class neighborhoods in that area that get robbed a lot.  My boss just had his golf cart robbed in broad daylight and a truck driver I know had his tractor stolen about a month ago.    As for bugs and humidity.  It gets pretty humid, so much so that it is like breathing chowder.  It storms in the evening almost daily right now.  There is a lot of pavement and buildings which keeps things really hot.  There are two seasons, mosquito season and hurricane season.  Knowing Spanish and/or Creole is a major bonus.  Lot's of food places, chain restaurants and mom and pop places.  Nascar moved to Homestead a while back, there is an annual rodeo, town fair, a vineyard, fruit and vegetable festival, etc.  Internet/cable is all good."
Miami,35i0cf,crusty_mustache,2,Sun May 10 22:08:23 2015 UTC,"Homestead is a nasty shithole and VERY undesirable.  I am sorry you have to relocate to that area.  There are lots of apartments in Homestead with what you are looking for in that price range or even cheaper.  Come a little south to Key Largo and you can find a 1/1 for about 1k per month.  It's safer, prettier, and LOTS of work and $$$ to be made.  Good luck with the move."
Miami,35i0cf,crusty_mustache,6,Sun May 10 21:05:06 2015 UTC,"Excuse my ignorance, but what work and money is there to be made in Key Largo unless you own a fishing charter, hotel, or maybe a restaurant?"
Miami,35i0cf,D_Adman,0,Sun May 10 21:56:49 2015 UTC,You don't have to be an owner of those establishments.  Being an employee is good enough.  The Playa is getting ready to open with 175 rooms and 3 bar/restaurants.  The Keys is all about tourism.  $$$  The Keys actually busses in staff because there aren't enough workers as it is.

Miami,35i0cf,dudeabides87,1 point,Sun May 10 21:34:32 2015 UTC,"homestead isn't THAT bad, compare it with Doral, Hialeah, north miami, and other dumps around the city it's pretty nice. neighborhoods are a little cleaner and the people are generally nicer. also the rent is cheaper farther south, places like cutler ridge and kendall are really nice in most areas and lots of high end stores and parks are around. key largo is a good choice if you're young and single and don't mind living in the middle of nowhere and working on boats or at a bar."
Miami,35i0cf,dudeabides87,1 point,Sun May 10 22:10:16 2015 UTC,it just seems like a bunch of chain restaurants and warehouses with ugly condo's and townhouses all in an area smaller than the airport.

Miami,35i0cf,goldmouthdawg,1 point,Mon May 11 17:45:18 2015 UTC,"Really? We aren't having any luck. Every nice apartment we seen and called in has a 6month-2year waitlist.  What do you mean 'up north'? North area/South Miami or way up North?  We are going to expand our budget to $1300-1400 a month, maybe more ... seems thats when there is some nice townhome listings to rent.  Would buy but not willing to in that area with risks/insurance/taxes."
Miami,35i0cf,dadecounty3051,1 point,Fri May 15 16:55:42 2015 UTC,"6month-2year waitlist.    They have so many places out there that is surprising.   What do you mean 'up north'? North area/South Miami or way up North?   I mean that the farther south you go, the less interesting things get.  You're a good distance away from everything except Key West. If none of that means anything to you, then you'll be ok. But that drive to get north and back south sucks imo. The highlights of the area are:   The outoor flea market The winery The berry farms Sonics Cracker Barrel Outlet mall"

Miami,35fjj1,hockeychris10,3,Sun May 10 00:43:35 2015 UTC,Here you can see a smashing demonstration of Miami turn signal etiquette. The only overtly visible turn signal happens at the 1:02 mark. As the turn signal is rarely used once it is engaged by the typical South Florida driver it will remain engaged until disengaged by natural mechanisms.

Another great resource is WLRN Public Radio. Most events that they advertise are 'intellectual' to some degree -- or cultural or something. Along a similar vein, you could check out events hosted by major non-profits in the area. There are a lot of organizations that thrive on community activism (check out Tropical Audubon Society).

The museum of science has a Young Patrons group that is for 21-40 and is great for networking.

Miami,35e1gg,ManBroDudeGuy,2,Sat May 9 12:56:34 2015 UTC,"If you're working in south beach and that's your housing budget I would recommend either finding a roommate situation in Miami Beach or commuting from out of town.  If you want your own decent place, I would also recommend upping your budget to the ~1200-1400 price range, but i still don't  think that affords most 1br in south beach.   Try Padmapper."

Mid-Beach and some of the older small buildings north of 5th have some lower income residents but crime is not a big problem anywhere.   South of 5th is quiter, more expensive, and feels more local. North of 5th is a bit more dense; congested, and has a lo more tourist too. Until you get to about north of 41st street.

Miami,3590md,ManBroDudeGuy,2,Fri May 8 14:28:20 2015 UTC,"I've got a Publix, a Fresh Market, and a Whole Foods all within walking distance.  Which is best probably depends on how much money I'm looking to spend!  As for traffic, I work downtown on Biscayne and take the MacArthur Causeway everyday.  It's definitely worse during rush hour, but the most I ever spend in the car is 35-40 minutes.  Going to work, the causeway itself is a breeze - it's not an issue until I get downtown.  Coming home, it gets backed up sometimes, but I'm never on it more than 15-20 mins.  Overall, I am completely thrilled with where I live from basically all angles. I moved here last summer from Indiana, and because I was still working there up until the week before the move, my girlfriend was the one who came down to do the apartment hunting, so I had never even seen my place or my neighborhood before move-in day.  IMO, she did a bang up job!  We just renewed because we're so happy here, and in 3 1/2 years, we've never renewed a lease before."
Miami,3590md,ManBroDudeGuy,1 point,Fri May 8 19:36:43 2015 UTC,35-40 mins. isn't so bad.  why not take the Venetian?  Are there not as many lanes as MacArthur?

Great weather, great food. But legal jobs are hard to come by. I recommend having something lined up before considering the move, at least getting in contact with a legal staffing company (Robert Half comes to mind).  Your husband will find a job quick.  Do you know Spanish bc that's a huge plus."
Miami,356jlw,dreminemike,5,Thu May 7 15:27:59 2015 UTC,"I do know Spanish yes. I've been speaking it for 13 years now but I could be a lot better (I just can't find an advanced, advanced class to take). My husband speaks fluent Spanish as it's his native language."
Miami,356jlw,dreminemike,9,Thu May 7 15:35:50 2015 UTC,"Then, honestly, you've conquered the hardest part. I have many transplant friends who say that the hardest part is the language. You won't need to take advanced classes living in Miami, everyone here speaks it. However, unless you live in Little Havana or Hialeah, you don't need to know it fluently.  I live and breathe the legal industry here in south Florida. It's not as easy as people think.   Price of living compared to DC is astronomically cheaper in Miami. My parents have a 4-bedroom single family home in Miami (they live near Flagler and 87 avenue, a pretty decent area), a home in their neighborhood ranges around 220-250k so it's not bad. It def is going up, tho, esp considering that area is 20 minutes from everywhere. I know an apt rent in that area for a 2-bedroom is around 1100-1300 a month, which isn't bad, esp when you're 20 minutes from everything. That gives you an idea of cost. That all depends on your budget, of course. You may be able to afford living in the Gables or South Miami, which are the places I would love to live and raise a family in.  People complain about traffic here. It's typically bc those folks haven't experienced real traffic. It takes me an hour max to get from downtown Miami to  Kendall (around Dadeland) during rush hour (no, I'm not using the metro, I should tho to save on gas). It used to take me 3 hours to drive the same distance in SoCal, each way. DC traffic can be bad too so I'm sure Miami traffic is little league compared to that."

Miami,356jlw,G19classified,7,Thu May 7 16:12:00 2015 UTC,"Well, it's very saturated here with lawyers (let's be honest, tho. It's like that for the rest of the Big Cities here in this country). So, it's also saturated with paralegals, esp inexperienced ones. Most lawyers pay paralegals garbage (I don't know how $10 an hour is ethically allowed but Florida Bar and MPRE are silent on that so that's that). I know other paralegals that get paid 70k (yeah, lots of long days). There are also document review projects that pay decent but can require licensing or JD at a minimum.   Like I mentioned, make sure you have something lined up before you take the dive. It wouldn't hurt to get in contact with Robert Half or a legal staffing agency. Experience is a plus, but that means local laws too. Federal experience is great, too.  Your husband should have no problem finding a gig."
Miami,356jlw,aCause4Concern,2,Thu May 7 16:39:17 2015 UTC,"Good paralegals are hard to find. Some firms pay them crap, good firms pay them well. Also depends on the area of law. The bigger firms in downtown pay competitive wages."
Miami,356jlw,chipichipisu,14,Mon May 11 01:15:39 2015 UTC,"I grew up in the DC metro area and moved here 11 years ago. I had 3 years of marriage under my belt and no kids. My wife and I partied it up here through our 30's and then finally had a kid. We are fortunate to live in Coconut Grove where there's a pretty good elementary school, otherwise I'm sure it'd be luck/inluence to get him into a charter school, or pay a fortune for private school. Public schools here are nowhere near on par with Montgomery County MD or northern VA.  There are plenty of things to do as a young family in Miami, especially if you like the outdoors.   The job market's not quote as vibrant as in DC, but there are certainly lots of law offices and restaurants so you shouldn't have a terrible time finding work. Probably best to get a job lined up before you pull up stakes and relocate though! And contrary to what some negative posters here in this sub say, spanish speaking is not a required skill to work here any more than it is in DC. I won't say it doesn't help, but honestly English see you through 99% of life here.   Another thing lots of folks will complain about here is the climate. I find it to be much more comfortable than the Hazy/Hot/Humid summertime in DC. It's honestly not as hot. And the mild winters here are glorious.  Recommendation - live as close to your work as possible(financially), and minimize your commute. Traffic here is annoyingly bad and variable tolls are becoming a significant cost concern. IMHO it's better to pay more for your house and property taxes, then get that money back in the form of equity and tax refunds - not to mention hours of your life not sitting in traffic and polluting the air.  Search this sub for neighborhood 'crime maps' - we've had some good threads that'll show you more attractive places to live.   If you have any other/more specific ?'s lemme know -"

Miami,356jlw,Otto_Lidenbrock,4,Sun May 10 22:26:03 2015 UTC,"So I currently live in DC and grew up in Miami. Let's begin. First off, forget about public transportation. You NEED a car to survive in Miami. People will tell you traffic is terrible, but DC isn't much better. Second, it is 95% Hispanic so people speak Spanish more often than not. Don't get me wrong, you'll be fine speaking English, but be prepared to hear Spanish all the time. Third, living is cheaper than in DC, that's for goddamn sure. Fourth, and I'll say this as a product of the public school system down there, if you have/are going to have kids, make sure you check the schools in the area. Schools aren't too terrible, but it's a big city. There's gangs, drugs, etc. your kid will experience this. Fifth, it's fucking HOT. Think about the month of summer in DC, make it significantly hotter, and extend it to about 10 9 months of the year:  Said some good things. Said some bad things. Now, I'll tell you how I feel about the city personally. I love my city. You have the beach, the night scene, beautiful women, insanely amazing food, and just about everything that's great about paradise. That said, I feel it's a great city to visit. Maybe even spend a certain amount of years living there. But for me, it's just a place I visit. I lived there until I was 21. It's where I'm from, but the culture around the city can get a little tiring for me.  Also, I will add since you said you were in the legal field, it's pretty saturated down there. The pay for a paralegal is not up to par with the standard of living. Having two incomes will help though. They will expect you to speak Spanish. You will be looked over if you don't. That's just an effect of everyone being Hispanic. Can you find a job? Sure, but it will be harder.  I'm pretty much done here, but if you got any questions ask away."

Miami,356jlw,sirmonkey95,3,Sun May 10 22:22:28 2015 UTC,"Former D.C. resident and Miami native here. Moved back to South Florida 3 years ago after a 6 year stint in D.C. Hardest thing adjusting to with the move back was driving! D.C. is such a walkable city with lots of public transportation options. Miami, like D.C., is made of many neighborhoods each with it's distinct style, demographics, etc. Difference is they are much more spread out than in D.C. Coconut Grove is still my favorite neighborhood to live in Miami. Great schools and parks for the kids, close the water and an overall great vibe. Plus you still have the feeling of living in a walkable community. BTW, did you ever go to the Dolphins meetups at Blackfin in downtown D.C.?"
Miami,356jlw,V4refugee,1 point,Thu May 7 16:03:53 2015 UTC,"No, I'm out in the suburbs of DC in Northern VA, ~35 miles from the city.

Miami plays the Skins on 9/13 and the NOVA club was able rent out the party deck - I may go to that, not sure I want to stand the entire game though.."
Miami,356jlw,monk3yboy305,3,Thu May 7 16:11:35 2015 UTC,There's awesome food. Shitty traffic. Speaking Spanish will enable you to not look like an idiot. Beautiful days. You must appreciate the beach to appreciate Miami. It helps to get a boat.

Miami,356jlw,codelitt,0,Thu May 7 17:44:07 2015 UTC,"Legal and restaurant industry are strong here so you'll have an easy job search.   Its very expensive for a young family to live in any of the hot spots. You'll likely be living in the burbs which can still be pricey.   Public schools are abysmal so private school is really your best option.   Spanish is really helpful to know. I speak fluently, but I know people who don't who often feel out of place.   I would genuinely say look at areas up north. Miami is great, but with normal incomes it must be a hard place to raise a family. Ft Lauderdale is a great option as is Palm Beach and Jupiter area. Same weather, close to dolphins stadium and IMHO more family friendly."

Miami,356jlw,13104598210,1 point,Thu May 7 19:37:06 2015 UTC,Yea I understand why you said what you said. In general public schools in Miami (Florida in general) suck except for Magnet schools. Magnet schools are basically public schools that have an admissions process and are designed for more gifted students.
Miami,356jlw,DylanTackoor,1 point,Thu May 7 20:03:28 2015 UTC,"Magnet schools specialize in a particular area and can thus ""attract"" students from outside their usual school district area.

It also opens up more opportunity for jobs with less commute time. Both Miami and Boca are hot spots for restaurants and legal firms, and the Fort Lauderdale area isn't too shabby either."
Miami,356jlw,Flymia,1 point,Thu May 7 18:18:08 2015 UTC,"It's hot, then it rains, then it's hot again. You get used to it. There's tons of good food and things to do at all hours. Speaking Spanish is a huge plus but you can pick it up as you go if not. Overall it's great here!"
Miami,356jlw,Flymia,1 point,Thu May 7 22:52:55 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the neighborhood and what you're interested in.  You can go to the beach everyday if you want to and hang out with the freaks/spazzes (south beach) or visit a more low-key beach everyday (north beach). If the beach isn't that important, but you want an urban lifestyle with a lot of restaurants/galleries/homeless people, downtown/Brickell awaits. If you want green suburbia and a McMansion, Kendell et al. are there for you. If you want to debate Cuban politics and play dominoes, move near Calle Ocho.  I don't think there's really any one Miami experience. There's the high rise Brickell condo life, the art deco sobe life, the obscenely rich Key Biscayne life, the suburb life, etc. etc.  All that said, I would NOT recommend Miami to a young family. Or Florida. The education system here is an obscene joke and after meeting a couple professors at Miami Dade College, who may well be the stupidest people I've ever met (one is a fucking beauty pageant winner who teaches a field she has no degree in), I wouldn't trust Florida's education system with my worst enemy's child. I am a former professor and hedge fund analyst, so I'm pretty smart and clued in on what makes an intelligent professor.  There's a reason Floridians are stupid. Pay teachers 30k per year and treat them like dogshit, and you'll breed stupid people.  So, yeah. Move here when your kids are 18. Or home school them."

If it's your first offense I think you can just opt to take an online class to remove the points.  I just went to a lawyer and let him handle the proceedings.     This is the guy I went with - http://ticketlawyer.com/ - Alberto Quirnates. I went with him twice and did well. He got my first offense completely removed, no points no fine. My second offense though I had to do a few hours of an online class to get points removed and I had to pay the court fees.    Also, I too have been chosen out of the pack before. I was pulled over by some FHP even though I was going at the same speed as traffic. They were randomly pulling cars over and letting others go. They had like a line of people pulled over. It was complete bullshit. If I were to go slower I would just obstruct traffic. I was literally just going with the flow of traffic on a highway."

It sounds like you want to go to the ballpark so you'll be dealing with that  at least once minimum.  Almost all events are located on the East side of south beach.  Yes, some clubs close their doors, some restaurants close their doors, traffic is rerouted and there are cops everywhere.  With that said, there is a big street party with a huge turnout so I'd have to imagine people find it fun.  I'm pretty sure you can pull up a few videos on Youtube and get a pretty good feel of what to expect on there.  If you don't plan on staying on or visiting South Beach than it is really just another weekend in (the rest of) Miami."
Miami,352adq,oneofyourFrenchgrrls,2,Wed May 6 17:02:07 2015 UTC,"I really appreciate the honesty. We are staying about a 3/4 mile walk from South beach, beach. We are planning to do a South beach club one night, and one night where we find a chiller fun bar (maybe with live music). The Orioles/marlins game we have tickets to is on Sunday, and we are flying out late Sunday night"
Miami,352adq,Brett4Life,6,Wed May 6 17:20:35 2015 UTC,"you really do not want to go to sobe. what ever article you read is right. many clubs, hotels and restaurants shut down/board up during this weekend.   there are clubs in other parts of town that are south beach'ish type places.... ie. Steam, Space & Electric Pickle, and also Grand Central for live music.  edit: added a comma"
Miami,352adq,oneofyourFrenchgrrls,5,Wed May 6 17:49:28 2015 UTC,"A lot of this is very sensationalist. I was back and forth to Sobe during last year's event. The festivities are mostly centered on South Beach, and the closer to get to ""ground zero"" the tougher to find parking, worse traffic etc as with any major event. There will not be ""several hours"" of traffic, but I would have a contingency plan in case you hit severe backups coming back from the game, coming in from the airport etc. I would not think more than an hour and a half to get from downtown to your destination on SOBE at even the worst of the traffic. An hour is standard though during heavy backup times. With no traffic you can get from downtown (where the stadium is) to SOBE within 15 minutes if you're lucky.  If you're looking for bottle service style clubs, I would consider some of the stuff off of South Beach like Mansion which is downtown. Just check the programming a week or two out because some of the EDM clubs will do hip hop during this week. As mentioned above, Grand Central (located downtown) is your best location to see a live, ticketed show. Also check out The Fillmore which is one Miami Beach.  If you are looking for a more low key club atmosphere I would check out Electric Pickle, Bardot, Treehouse, Steam.   Definitely check out the Broken Shaker for a low key drink on South Beach. Universally acclaimed, beautiful atmosphere. Otherwise most of the good low key drink places would be located more on the mainland / downtown. You should make a trip to the Wynwood Arts District. That's Miami's hot up and coming, dare I say hipster area. A lot of great bars there, and you won't run into any beach week craziness.   Let me know if you have additional questions. Don't let the fellow basement dwelling, fear mongering redditors on here scare you :)"

Miami,352adq,Thought-Starter,4,Wed May 6 17:14:15 2015 UTC,"Stay away from South Beach... Check out Wynwood, Midtown, Brickell, CocoWalk, you can take a quick trip to islamorada (2hours), or a longer voyage down to key west (4hours)."

That said, it's gotten so much better than it used to be. I remember watching that crazy car chase and hearing the gunshots on Alton road."
Miami,352adq,oneofyourFrenchgrrls,3,Wed May 6 20:26:05 2015 UTC,"I've stuck around the beach for a few years now and it really isn't big deal if you stay away from the areas the locals rarely visit anyway; Ocean and Collins.  I live on the west side of the beach and it was business as usual in my part of town and at my local eating and drinking spots (quieter if anything, since no one came over from the main land)."
Miami,352adq,JoblessZombie,3,Wed May 6 22:00:03 2015 UTC,"As long as you don't care about going to Miami Beach you are fine. There are plenty of other beaches to enjoy the water and sand. And there are plenty of places on the mainland to have good nights out that won't be overwhelming.   And by overwhelming, last year event went pretty well from what I heard. There were no major news stories which means it went well. But its full of police, road closures, very strict parking enforcement, very strict open bottle container enforcement etc.. Its a pain really if anything.   As for Clubs and walking about South Beach, hope you enjoy hip-hop music.   I have actually got over to lincoln road a few years ago during the weekend and it was not bad at all, not crowded."
Miami,352adq,zewm426,2,Wed May 6 18:35:52 2015 UTC,"I lived on south beach last year and had the pleasure of being an ACLU Legal Observer for Memorial Day Weekend as well to monitor the way the police responded to the people after the tragedy a few years ago.   Unfortunately, the beach is suffocated to death for the weekend by the way the area is regulated during Memorial Day Weekend. If I remember correctly they closed all but one bridge onto the beach and the only open highway was clogged with a DUI checkpoint. People HS to suffer through HOURS of traffic just to get home.  Additionally, most (but not all) of the popular clubs/stores/bars/restaurants closed early in the evening or simple closed for the whole weekend. So that was a buzz kill for many people.   It appeared to me that the real party during Memorial Day Weekend has moved to Downtown/Midtown/Wynwood."
Miami,352adq,aCause4Concern,1 point,Wed May 6 22:35:40 2015 UTC,"honestly? if i remember right last year it went pretty good. I don't remember there being any news stories of violence or arrests like there have been in years past. I personally wasn't there but AFAIK things went smoothly last year. generally many locals tend to avoid the beach during that weekend because the event is notorious for crime, traffic, and heavy police presence but as I mentioned earlier, things seemed to have gone well last year and its probably pretty fun if things go well again this year."

This little black kid (about 10-12 years old) stole some CDs and ran out the door, alarm beeping, running as fast as he could down the hallway and out the mall. We had a black security guard at our mall that responded to the call regarding the theft from our store. As she began taking notes of the situation and trying to get a description of the kid, my supervisor was nervous as fuck talking to her. When she got to asking what color/race he was, my supervisor was trying to avoid saying he was black (presumably because she was black?) and told her the kid was ""Urban"".  When I overheard that, I just thought ""Dude, what are you doing? Just tell her the kid is black. She's not going to hate you, she the security guard. She needs to know who she's looking for.""  Just one of the funny memories I have from working at that place."

The only one left in South Florida is up in Sawgrass Mills.  They used to have a huge store in Dolphin Mall and at least one store in every major mall. They even had two stores in Dadeland after the Specs merge.  The company is run by idiots that are stuck in the 90s and have no clue how to do business in the digital age of technology.   Hell, when I was working at the store, we carried cassettes and vhs up until the mid 00s. It was pretty pathetic how bad they were at adapting to changes in the market.  They went from ~15 stores down here to nothing within a decade."

It's absolutely there safest way to do so. I don't care if they are going 30 over the speed limit please get out of the way. There reason the autobahn is so successful is because the left lane is the go fast lane and people follow the rules of the road. Slow drivers are dangerous on the highway. They bottle up traffic and cause unnecessary jams. Now I'm not telling you don't be in the left lane, just remember move if someone is fast approaching you and let them pass. They even passed a law in Florida where they are trying to pull over drivers going under the speed limit on the expressway for no reason."
Miami,34y1rw,miaminative1,-11,Wed May 6 01:00:35 2015 UTC,"Well, generally I'm already going a little over the speed limit (5, 10mph tops). If you are approaching a little over that, it's easy for you to pass on the right. But if you are coming down the express at literally 110mph, I'm not moving my car, not because I want to be a dick, but because I don't trust you can actually realize I'm moving and not hit me from behind."
Miami,34y1rw,cptnpiccard,9,Wed May 6 01:07:43 2015 UTC,it's easy for you to pass on the right.   no one's supposed to have to pass on the right. get out of the left lane.

Also being on friendly terms sends the message that the Castro regime really isn't so bad, when in fact it's easily the worst thing that could have happened to that island, staying in the Spanish Empire would have been better for Cubans, hell, even the US annexing Cuba would have been better. I can see why that would make them angry and I (being the son of a Cuban et cetera) certainly can relate at least in sentiment. I think to dismiss them like this is being unfair.  As it happens, liberalization because of the embargo is not happening, ever, and it hasn't worked ever. In general embargoes are overrated. Opening up relationships will make the standard of living of the average Cuban better, and it takes the ""we only suck because of the embargo!"" argument away, which I think is huge, so on those grounds I support it. You never hear supporters of the normalization say this however, I wonder why they feel so strongly about something that as far as I can tell is just a partisan issue for them.  And just for the record, I think not learning the language is indefensible and don't think for a second think you, or people who antagonize the old Cuban folks like you do, are racist."

Yes, punching her was an overreaction to this stunt that she pulled. But she isn't just standing handcuffed, minding her own business and maintaining a proper composure.   They could probably charge her with ""assaulting an officer""... so in exchange for dropping that assault charge she agrees  not pursue any charges against the detective for any misconduct (That's how I see that playing out...)."
Miami,34vcyz,Krisrk,4,Tue May 5 01:30:35 2015 UTC,It's not a zero-sum game.  You can charge them both.
Miami,34vcyz,TunaNugget,8,Tue May 5 03:01:35 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty obvious she should be charged and convicted of assaulting a police officer (for the spitting alone, and then the kick as well). However, physically assaulting a detained, wounded, and partially restrained citizen in the head is not merely an ""overreaction"". That was by definition retaliation and not defense.  The problem with your scenario is that both may have committed crimes and it is not up to the officer to deliver discretionary justice. The officer is a professional and needs to act accordingly."
Miami,34vcyz,Krisrk,3,Tue May 5 01:45:08 2015 UTC,"I would agree... the detective was a hot head and he took his anger out on her as a result because he lost his temper and his cool. As a representative of the law he should set the standard. The problem with this scenario is that usually the officers/detectives are going to protect one another and IA will find no wrong doing. It is also correct that it isn't up to him to deliver the justice... but guess what, he did so anyways. Just because you shouldn't or are not supposed to do something doesn't mean that people will follow those guidelines, laws, rules, moral/ethical behavior, or conform to what is expected of them.

What I did was I matched it up with google maps and dropped a pin and got the address, then matched that address on white pages with the names of the registered owners. We filed a police report and my friend got his phone back. This was University of Miami PD, though. I would definitely file a report. Then text the thieves that you know where they live and that you filed a police report. Either way, good luck!"
Miami,34q5op,PhoenixAvenger,10,Sun May 3 16:23:17 2015 UTC,Then text the thieves that you know where they live and that you filed a police report.   I would advise against this part. They will just ditch your phone in the trash and you will never get it back.

Miami,34q5op,Jorgisimo62,3,Mon May 4 08:23:04 2015 UTC,My girlfriend has had her iPhone stolen twice. Both times they turned it off immediately so we were screwed. If you can ping it put it in locked mode and go to the police station and let them know where it is. They told me that they would send a squad car down and ask if they have the phone they will treat it as if it was misplaced not stolen. You at least have a leg up.
Miami,34q5op,palaceofwinds,1 point,Sun May 3 19:35:30 2015 UTC,Yea exactly that has happened to me many times.

Miami,34q5op,egons,1 point,Tue May 5 22:55:05 2015 UTC,My experience is the cops will go and knock on the door. If they answer they'll ask if they will give it back. That's it.

Miami,34q5op,croquetica,0,Sun May 3 18:28:19 2015 UTC,"This literally happened to me 2 years ago. I tracked my phone to some sketch neighborhood that I felt uneasy visiting, even with an entourage. I went to the cops and filled out a report. I showed the desk cop the location of the Phone on my iPad. His reaction? ""We can't just go into people's houses."" I could have cried right then and there. How would this be any different from seeing your stolen car in someone's yard? Why don't the police care enough to catch criminals when the evidence is outstanding?  I found other stories in other cities where the cops were complacent enough to help. Not here, not in Miami. I asked my neighbor (whose brother is a cop) and he said the most you can do is go into the neighborhood, track down an officer already working the beat and explain the situation. All they can do is accompany you to the house. They will not go into the house, they won't even force the people to answer the door if that's their wish.  Long story short, I sent the crooks a nasty message about karma, erased the phone and bought a new one.   Sorry, my friend, it blows. You'd think cops would be eager to catch a criminal with evidence. Maybe in the future things will change. May our thieves catch Hep C!"
Miami,34q5op,001503,5,Sun May 3 18:41:23 2015 UTC,I don't think the word complacent means what you think it means.

Miami,34q5op,croquetica,1 point,Sun May 3 23:46:23 2015 UTC,"I also told my thieves that I would offer a reward but there was no reaction. So overnight I sent them the very loud ping over and over. I didn't want to retaliate too much because I was at the beach when the phone was stolen and at the time I didn't lock it with a pin. They had access to my info/photos for hours. First thing I did when I got my new phone was set it to immediately lock. I also have photo stream activated so I can access my photos remotely in case I ever lose my phone.

In 1992 Towles documented 1,400 nesting birds there, including 700 great egrets and 450 white ibis. Now, he says, there are not enough trees to support more than a few hundred birds. In addition to the white ibis roosting on the last scrawny patch of pond apple, he spots about 50 anhingas through his binoculars. ""Historically, this has been a really important rookery island,"" he says ruefully, ""and now, in the blink of an eye, it's gone.""   ...   They have been surprised to discover that the peat samples from all seven of their study islands show a heavy abundance of naturally occurring phosphorus--especially on notable colony islands like L-67. ""We think it's coming from the birds,"" says Orem. Bird droppings break down into phosphorus, which leaves a record in the peat. The high concentrations show up even in the oldest islands in their study, which date to 4,000 years ago. This suggests that wading birds have flourished in the Everglades since the watery wilderness was born, five millennia ago--at least until the 20th century, when their populations dropped an estimated 90 percent. ""There may be a link between the disappearance of tree islands and the decline in wading-bird populations,"" says Orem.   üòï"

To start with they would require you put up all the money up front which could be a bit burdensome. However the moral of the story is that you have many options available to you with some effort. I suggest checking craigslist as well as airbnb. You don't specify why you prefer Miami Beach, however I do because of it's small size as well as relative proximity to the beach itself. I grew up along Miami Beach until i was 18. If you tell us more about your expectations we can give you better advisement."

Miami,34hjxy,ReharshedAgain,3,Fri May 1 10:26:48 2015 UTC,"Undershirt is absolutely necessary if you sweat at all.  I am a bigger guy (read:fat) and pickup the white undershirts at walgreens every couple months.  They are thicker than some of the Hanes you get in the pack.  Also, deodorant can make a difference too.  I have realized only Mitchem  will work for me.  Also, wash your undershirts in hit water and dry without dryer sheets.  Replace the shirt every couple keeps as antiperspirant will sometimes get embedded and won't come out.  As far as the actual button down, I had huge luck with a brand from Sears called Manhattan; they are cotton and breath well.  Also the Stafford wrinkle free wears well with no starch needed.  Sears, Kohls, and Marshalls  have been good sources.  Noticed that any of the CK fitted are closely cropped in the underarm and if you have some weight on you will show pit sweat quickly, even with an undershirt."
Miami,34hjxy,decoy321,2,Fri May 1 14:25:05 2015 UTC,"To prevent the damage done by deodorant to shirts, it helps to scrub them real quick in hot water after they're used that day. The discoloration that ruins shirts is caused by deodorant reacting to the laundry detergent, so getting it out before you wash them will at least double their lifespan.   Once I learned to do this I saved hundreds. I used to buy new undershirts every other month. Now I've got a drawer full of them that have lasted me years."

Miami,34hjxy,decoy321,1 point,Fri May 1 10:58:21 2015 UTC,"You should definitely wear undershirts. I've found that a-shirts, the tank top style ones, improve airflow when all dressed up. Without one, thicker materials can stick to skin, raising its temperature and causing it to sweat more. The undershirts provide a middle layer that allows more air inside, keeping everything pleasant.   Just be mindful of wearing undershirts by themselves in public. There's a pretty widespread stereotype associating them with people who beat their wives. Hence ""wifebeaters"".   It's a fucking shame though because they're so goddamn perfect for this weather."

They pre-cook then finish the ribs on the grill. This caramelizes their signature tangy bbq sauce.  I haven't been to a Flanigan's in a while, but their ribs have always been consistent.  Now, if you want true smoked bbq ribs you have several options.  Tom Jenkins, Swine (expensive, but super smokey and meaty), Bulldog. These places use a thicker cut of rib (spare/st. louis style) and are not necessarily ""fall off the bone"" but ""sink your teeth into"" type ribs.    South Florida has tons of options now, so it's hard to go wrong.  Just stay away from Tony Roma's. More often than not, the ribs were absolute crap."

I've never searched for a roommate so I don't have a lot of advice in that area, but I'm sure someone else with more experience can guide you.

I don't think it should have a negative affect on your views of driving manual transmission."
Miami,34cva4,soundman1024,7,Fri May 1 18:10:53 2015 UTC,It's like any city. If you're new to driving a standard you'll want to be comfortable with your car and when to be in what gear. In traffic try to stick to one gear and let the space in front of you grow/shrink. That's the best way to alleviate traffic jams and the easiest way to drive them in a standard.  Really not a big deal. Just drive.
Miami,34cva4,SPER,4,Thu Apr 30 03:34:19 2015 UTC,Ughh.. Miami drivers are very impatient and opportunistic.. When I try leaving a gap there is always someone that turns into that gap.. 9/10 times without using their signal.
Miami,34cva4,soundman1024,-1,Thu Apr 30 13:29:05 2015 UTC,That's good though. That's someone who isn't stopping to change lanes because they waited until the last minute to get over for their exit.  Except those people who merge a bat out of hell so they can get somewhere 20 seconds faster.
Miami,34cva4,nidex,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:33:58 2015 UTC,"Studies have actually shown that ""zipper merging"" (waiting until the last possible chance) is better for traffic flow than merging earlier, provided everybody lets them in. This creates one merge spot instead of having people merging early everywhere, slowing down the entire lane of traffic behind them so they can move over, leaving plenty of empty lane in front of them."
Miami,34cva4,soundman1024,1 point,Sun May 3 14:24:57 2015 UTC,"If people would actually follow the zipper, sure. But assholes are always going to be merging in exit only lanes to get ahead then merging back. Likewise when people are in a hurry they might not let someone zipper in. When you leave space you're negating the impact of the assholes and keeping things moving at a consistent pace. Zipper is great in a lab and when it works in the wild, but more often than not it becomes the wild wild west."
Miami,34cva4,nidex,0,Sun May 3 15:40:24 2015 UTC,"True. When we had construction (before I moved to Florida) there were digital signs posted about the zipper merging, instructing drivers to stay in their lane and merge at the end. It was also on the news and in the newspaper because it was a major construction project- I'd say maybe 9 out of 10 cars followed the procedure and it worked much, much better than otherwise. I suppose it would be just a matter of informing people."

Miami,34cva4,godlameroso,2,Thu Apr 30 23:00:27 2015 UTC,"Stop and go driving is bad for the clutch, since you're slipping it each time you move from a standstill. An automatic uses a fluid coupling instead of a friction coupling so it's better suited to stop and go. Don't forget to empty and refill your clutch fluid reservoir 3-4 times a year. It'll keep your clutch hydraulics from going bad due to dirty fluid deteriorating the seals."

Even areas that are high enough above sea level to not be affected ""over the top"" likely won't be able to function due to problems below the ground. Geochemical weathering (from top and bottom) and rain water draining more slowly are going to be huge problems everywhere, even in those areas.  The South Beach (and Sweetwater) solution of pumping water out (with diesel powered pumps) is short-sighted and no one has really suggested anything to convince me that South Florida is going to survive into even the near future.

We're feeling the impacts now and that is going to continue and continue to cause problems in low lying areas.   I'm always personally hesitant to suggest specific timelines because the rate of sea level change is constantly accelerating. This article talks about that a bit at the local level but I just read a normal article suggesting that the rate of change is growing even faster than anyone anticipated. I do think 100 years is about the breaking point but expect significant problems with more tidal flooding and saltwater intrusion before then."

You can try a serious dating service or even tinder

Miami,341f6c,decoy321,10,Mon Apr 27 16:23:28 2015 UTC,It's that breach into turning the walls from canvases to billboards.
Miami,341f6c,Esotastic,3,Mon Apr 27 16:14:56 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I have not heard about any rules or regulations as to what people can put on the walls so I can only assume that the building owners can do whatever they want with them, but if Soho Studio understands that this turns people off or upsets members of the community hopefully they will change it.   twitter is probably the best route for that."
Miami,341f6c,mkhaytman,5,Mon Apr 27 16:51:03 2015 UTC,I wish a legit graffiti artist would come by and just paint over it.
Miami,341f6c,dcht,2,Tue Apr 28 04:26:26 2015 UTC,Seriously! I was thinking about this last night. Would love to see it happen.
Miami,341f6c,enmo,3,Tue Apr 28 11:03:00 2015 UTC,"This sort of thing happens all the time. Guerrilla advertising/marketing that generates viral buzz online and word-of-mouth publicity in the local context.   It's sad, though, that advertisers/marketers don't realize that these tactics actually alienate their brands from the demographic they're trying to exploit (the artsy/hipster crowd that hangs out in wynwood). The effect they wish to create from such ""viral"" campaigns becomes adverse, and the brand image suffers. People who hang out in wood tavern and gramps don't really go for oculto, which btw is a crappy name for an alcoholic drink. They're going to do it even less now. I guarantee it.   But I guess that type of backlash is previously considered... because ""any publicity is good publicity.""  As for the artist involved, well, I guess that's the trend. No starving artists in wynwood, I guess."
Miami,341f6c,enmo,2,Mon Apr 27 17:30:22 2015 UTC,Well in this case I don't really blame Anheuser Busch as much as Soho Studios. At least Budweiser didn't do anything illegal in this case unlike Sony. In fact I would bet that they paid the artist well. Like you said they are just trying to push their product on the hipster crowd and make some money which is their job.   However if Soho Studios wants to be a respectable member of the Wynwood community and have a successful venue there then they should be responsible stewards of such a prominent wall. I know I won't be going there. Hopefully this sort of thing turns people off and they just go out of business or realize that their blatant corporate ad is turning people off and change it.
Miami,341f6c,invisiblewar,2,Mon Apr 27 17:43:14 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I won't be going there either.   Soho Studios is the party at ""fault"" here, but I don't blame them for trying to make money from renting out their wall space. However, I do believe that they have a choice as to who they sublet that wall to, and oculto is as lame a product brand as there's ever going to be. Usually these projects are curated, and the artist selection process is not done based on cost/roi/whatever bs marketing lingo... if done right, they come off as genuine works of street art. But no, oculto had to occupy more than 30% of the wall space with their product packaging. To the herds of automats that roam wynwood at night, this probably goes unnoticed, but for me it's just the worst kind of disingenuous marketing out there. Then again, I'm not their intended audience :)"
Miami,341f6c,Dangotron,3,Mon Apr 27 19:03:45 2015 UTC,I almost went to their event on Saturday. Glad I didn't because I've heard really bad reviews about the stuff. It reminds me of the huge push desperados had a few months back

Miami,341f6c,myfivelies,3,Mon Apr 27 19:14:00 2015 UTC,"I went past night. They spent millions redoing Soho studios into a maze of different themed party rooms. They did events this past weekend, and are doing it next weekend also. I have no problem with this as long as the events are going on, but would be upset if allowed to stay after this whole promotional event comes to an end."
Miami,341f6c,Florida-Man,1 point,Mon Apr 27 22:13:35 2015 UTC,"From what I saw on the Oculto twitter they mention ""leaving their mark"", but I agree it may not be a big deal depending on how temporary it is. However, I would imagine that once the contract with Oculto runs out Soho Studio's next customer would get a mural there which in effect would make it a billboard.   If they allow an artist to create an unrelated mural there in a couple of weeks obviously I will have to admit it's not that big of a deal and was simply part of a temporary marketing experiment."
Miami,341f6c,krautrock,3,Mon Apr 27 22:48:47 2015 UTC,"I am okay with artists finding sponsors in the commercial community to drive the cost of their time and effort.   Consider this: Wynwood is an open forum. That wall is out for any other artists to respect, comment upon, alter or otherwise mark-up the sponsored statement. Advertising like this is vulnerable to satire."

Seats maybe 30 people tops.  The local in coral gables has amazing food. They EC, Phil, is the guy that opened swine and the food is top notch. Great craft beer selection too. Rotates weekly.   Speaking of swine, Swine. Happy hour is the bomb, they have happy hour food as well and just got a new EC, Jacob Anaya. He's doing some bang up, outta the box cooking. Try their ribs, shrimp and grits and always ask about daily specials. Chef Jacob comes up with some great stuff.  Deep in Kendall on 147th and coral way is Finka table and tap. Lots o Miami Beach style creativity without having to drive all the way to the beach.   Sakaya kitchen in Midtown is really great Asian fusion. Coconut rice is outta hand.   Bulla Gastrobar off on Ponce in coral gables is really good too. Spanish gastronomy with outta hand sangria.

The problem there though is that rents are going up and you never know when your landlord might sell out to a developer.   Also consider South Beach -- the residential neighborhood is really pleasant. I know lots of people in big studios for less than $1100, and rents aren't going up as much. People with money want newer places with more amenities, and you don't have to worry about South Beach being radically redeveloped in the way that places in the City of Miami are prone to. It's very walkable, and you won't have any problems taking the causeways off the beach onto the highways (getting back on can be a pain at certain times)."

Do you like nightlife? If you have the money, Miami Beach is a good bet. If you're more into art and the hipster scene then Wynwood is your best bet. Outdoorsy? Pick a place near the Everglades or a state park (Oleta, Bill Baggs..) If you want access to everything pick a more central place like Miami Springs. Brickell can be the most expensive area but it has great transportation options and is near a lot of typical city living amenities.  It really depends what you want."

I've had my credit and debit cards used fraudulently at least on 8 different occasions. I have never paid a cent for any of the stupid things these scums buy. Its the retailers that get screwed, which in turn does increase prices slightly.   That time I went to buy furniture and purchased a ton of stuff and no one asked for ID once. I can see how it happens. Someone my card was once used in Target in Naples and McDonalds in NYC within mins. Love how target just lets someone buy $5,000 worth of things without blinking an eye."

I noticed because there was a purchase on my statement from BJs that I never made. I called up my bank to inform them of the situation, and they told me that there was a purchase made for $150.00 and another attempt to purchase that was not allowed to go through. Why would a thief come up to a cash register and say ""stop when the amount gets to $150.00"" and then trying again without someone there knowing exactly what they were up to? They were clearly checking to see if I had that amount in my account before continuing on until I ran out of funds. Luckily, I didn't pay for anything I didn't purchase so OP here is right about the retailers being the ones that suffer here."

I stupidly left my card with her, then ran back in to get it when I realized what I had done. That night I had 3 or 4 ridiculous transactions that the bank caught.

I use my bike to commute to work and go out on weekend pretty regularly and I'm always surprised at how many other cyclists I see that don't wear helmets, use bike lights to enhance their visibility, or obey basic traffic laws.  While I think that the actions of the driver of the car are despicable, I also think that cyclists who go out cycling at very late or very early hours need to seriously consider the risk they are taking especially if they are not making efforts to ensure their safety."

Miami,33q7ss,area88guy,9,Fri Apr 24 16:40:26 2015 UTC,"Well, if you've never been to Miami, the Miami you are probably thinking of in your head is actually Miami Beach. It's a city in and of itself and that's where you have the art deco and neon and all the scarface looking stuff you associate with Miami.   There, the East-West streets are numbered and there are several notable thoroughfares everyone knows like Washington Ave and Collins Ave and Ocean Drive. Those all run North/South. Espanola Way and Lincoln Road are also in the area and are notable streets that run East/West. Lincoln Road is best known for Lincoln Road mall, which is an outdoor mall (really just a bunch of shops and restaurants along a closed off street with water fixtures and landscaping in the middle). All of this is in South Beach.  Beyond that, we have Little Haiti and Little Havana known for their Haitian and Cuban communities (duh) further west. Little Havana is marked most often by 8th street or Calle Ocho. University of Miami is in Coral Gables, which is also it's own city, but it's surrounded by Miami on all sides, so it's not like a suburb. It's south and west of Downtown Miami and Miami Beach. Coral Gables has the Miracle Mile which is on Coral Way. The Miracle Mile is like the hip downtown area of Coral Gables.   That'll get you started. I would suggest sticking to South Beach. You can get a lot of mileage from the clubs and hotels and history in that area. And it'd probably be easy to pull up something on Google Maps or a travel book that'll give you a clear picture of the area."

Miami,33kyip,beniceorbevice,2,Fri Apr 24 13:47:38 2015 UTC,Best time of year to see manatees is in the winter. If you look in the canals in Coral Gables and along the shoreline in the bay you can see them. I've also seen some at the beach close to the shore before.
Miami,33kyip,frostyjohnmiamijohn,4,Sat Apr 25 02:45:36 2015 UTC,You need a pfd and a whistle. Also lights if you go out at night.

Miami,33kyip,aCause4Concern,1 point,Mon Apr 27 00:52:35 2015 UTC,"Crandon and Bill Baggs on Key Biscayne both have some annoying regulations that limit where you can launch.  Crandon makes you launch at the marina ramp (12 bucks to park, WTF) amongst all the stinkpot boats.  Bill Baggs makes you launch from one small section of beach on the east side. It's a long portage so bring a cart with beach tires. At least they set aside a couple 'reserved for kayaks' parking spaces close to the path.  What's annoying to me is that these parks (Crandon in particular) permit paddlecraft launches elsewhere - if they're rented from their 3rd party vendor. It's like you're penalized for owning your own kayak. Meanwhile jetskis come land on the beach unfettered."

I'd recommend looking into HomePath properties. They are bank owned and only require 3% down, but interest rates are still very low because your loan is backed by Fannie and Freddie. You can also take a 2-day course and get 3% of purchase price refunded towards closing costs.

Miami,33f3sd,Miamime,2,Fri Apr 24 00:04:18 2015 UTC,Do you use a FPV setup or are you just guestimating when you fly?
Miami,33f3sd,vitaminKsGood4u,2,Wed Apr 22 03:39:59 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it's a FPV, he rotates the camera to get better shots. If it isn't FPV, then goddamn that's awesome flying by OP"
Miami,33f3sd,virgin_thx_2_reddit,2,Wed Apr 22 04:38:50 2015 UTC,"I think I could have got away with no FPV as long as I was close enough to the UAS to see orientation. Start far away and move closer to me so I can eye the orientation then start a pan or rotation. It's not like OP had to ""track"" anything, its a large crowd of people (so panning is just panning to more people) but I don't know how far away he was. Its max altitude looked like it was pushing the 120m default limit on the P2 and at that height and distance I have to rely on my screen so I am leaning on FPV. But still good work from OP with or without it.  Then again, I may be totally wrong and I need to rewatch it."
Miami,33f3sd,vitaminKsGood4u,2,Wed Apr 22 05:02:02 2015 UTC,"I normally do, but when I pulled the drone out that day on the beach my FPV wasn't working and I couldn't figure out why. Finally noticed that the small, fragile ribbon that sends video from the GoPro to the monitor was torn. So this was all shot blind. But as stated below, it wasn't too hard when you know the direction you're facing and you have a huge target."

Fortunately I had a good stack of shit from when radioshack went out of business that I am stocked on random odd electronics shit for a while. My RC Controller slid off my car hood and popped ofoff the GPS/ATTI switch and I had to put a new one of those in too.  Nice work man! I hate flying over water but it is sooo pretty here."

Miami,33f3sd,J_the_Man,2,Wed Apr 22 13:50:42 2015 UTC,"Not OP but, I love my Phantom 2 with H3-3D gimbal and Flysight Black Perl/immersionRC FPV setup. I have modded my H3-3D to use with either my GoPro Hero3+ and GoPro Hero 4. It was an expensive setup especially now that the P3 is literally just a few days out but I do like the more options the P2 has over the 3 so I am not sure yet if I will get a P3 or not.  Do you have one or thinking about getting one?"
Miami,33f3sd,vitaminKsGood4u,1 point,Wed Apr 22 22:28:20 2015 UTC,Thinking of getting one. Are there no gas/nitro powered options?
Miami,33f3sd,J_the_Man,1 point,Wed Apr 22 22:56:00 2015 UTC,"I have seen a few gas ones but most of them are home made. Battery is just easier to work with I think. And I think gas comes with some interesting weight complications. Your UAS getting lighter the longer it flies and not having a constant weight seems kinda wonky for such a small aircraft. I am really just pulling that outa my ass though, they do exist.  The battery on the Phantom 2 will get you between 15 and 20 minutes. I hear the P3 should have 20+ minutes on a full charge. So I pack a few extra batteries and just recharge them overnight. I have seen some aftermarket batteries with longer flight times but I am not going to guinea pig them. If reviews build up and they are positive I may try one out eventually.  The new Phantom 3 is a really nice RTF FPV UAS but there are some others in the same price and feature range. /r/djiphantom  and /r/dji are there to look through too if you are curious. I actually prefer the P2 over the P3 because of the use of the GoPro (I can pop it of and attach it to my surfboard or take it swimming) but if you are not interested in the GoPro the P3 is a nice all in one package right out the box.  Unfortunately Phantom owners get a bad name becaue of their popularity. A lot of people have one and not all of them are very responsible. Personally I have insurance for mine ($2,000,000 in injury and damages plus $1000 theft) and think it is a good idea but I think most people just brave it with the numbers on their side."
Miami,33f3sd,vitaminKsGood4u,1 point,Wed Apr 22 23:18:25 2015 UTC,Who insures it? I think of gas because of longer flight time but I imagine 4 rotors would make it complicated. Thanks for the info!

In Soviet times the problem was Soviet Russia in general, corruption etc. Truth be told, Cuba is one of the few countries in Latin America I wouldn't mind visiting, as far as safety in concerned.  Also, if I were to pick any country in Latin American to live in, being anyone but from the upper class, I would pick Cuba in a heartbeat. Source: I'm someone whose parents escaped from an Eastern Bloc country.  They remember the bad, but they also can see the good now, after having experienced Capitalism.  Not saying Communism is the way to go, but it'd be great to have an honest discussion about it without it being immediately vilified.

Deaths are THREE TIMES the national average. There are little, if any, concessions given to their safety. I moved down from Maryland where there were plenty of bike lanes with walls, rails to trail riding, etc. Just look at the comments on this article and other bicycle deaths, most of them are ""WHY WOULD ANYONE RIDE ON THIS BRIDGE?"" Not, hey, maybe we should improve safety because bikes have just as much right as cars to the roads. It shouldn't be our fault that the city was designed so poorly.   That being said, I will never ride on the roads here. Ever. I did it a couple weeks ago, trying to get to a trail from my house and in the span of less than a mile and hugging the curb, I nearly got clipped twice.

This article would probably be better appreciated by San Franciscans or folks interested in urban planning/development issues."
Miami,338jk7,TunaNugget,6,Mon Apr 20 19:51:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's a minor aspect; I think it's the fundamental dynamic of the area.  Little Havana hasn't resisted gentrification because of enlightened zoning and a Cuban affection for dilapidated neighborhoods -- that's actually laughable.  It's because there's quite a lot of population pressure from new immigrants entering the area.  I also think they keep prices relatively high, because they're willing to pay a premium (relative to the condition of the buildings) to live in a Spanish-speaking area."

Miami,338jk7,13104598210,6,Mon Apr 20 19:13:42 2015 UTC,"So, I suppose I owe you an explanation. The real reason the real estate markets in SF and Miami are difference is simple: land and economic makeup.  Miami is a much larger city with more land available and much less population density. This will always mean its development will be cheaper than in SF, since Miami has 40x as much land to build on.  More importantly, though, the local economy is massively different. The author is funny in implying that the Brickell condos are a result of the growth of the tech industry in Miami, which is comically puny. It's money laundering from Latam and Eastern Europe, and everyone knows it. SF's housing boom (well, its inflationary prices) is from well-paid engineers. They're totally apples and oranges.  In short, the author's prescription to just let the rich people concentrate in underdeveloped areas cannot ever happen in SF because there's no desirable space to do that. There's nothing even close to a Brickell, or Wynwood, or Edgewater in the bay area."

Miami,32zg28,humanmanguy,8,Sun Apr 19 02:14:03 2015 UTC,"By the water. My family had a house in a very nice neighborhood, very expensive homes near by, the bay was also right there, roaches were common along with lizards, spiders, iguanas etc. Its the tropics, just something you deal with."
Miami,32zg28,Flymia,2,Mon Apr 20 22:11:51 2015 UTC,"Make sure you note the difference between roaches and palmetto bugs.  I am not geeky bug guy so I don't know the species nam3s, but I see a diff err ence in location between the two.  In land filled areas such as planned communities, I see a larger volume of palmetto bugs.  In more rural areas and out towards the glades, roaches are a pently."
Miami,32zg28,ReharshedAgain,0,Sat Apr 18 03:26:29 2015 UTC,They are the same thing. No difference. I think Florida has 6 or 8 species of roaches. Just know if you see them in your home then your attic is infested.   Best way to keep them out of your home is to keep it clean and don't leave any foods out. Then you can set bait stations and control the issue. Or call pest control.   I have to learn about this stuff every year.
Miami,32zg28,bax101,2,Sat Apr 18 15:38:56 2015 UTC,"Palmetto bugs (big black roaches) are inevitable in south Florida. They are native and will make their way inside your home or apartment somehow (but this is ok because they will eventually die of thirst and they do not infest homes) I have seen palmetto bug roaches on the 28th floor balconies of The Icon in Brickell and 11th floor of Canyon Ranch in miami beach. No matter how expensive your home is you will likely encounter one someday. They are quite simply inevitable but that's ok.   German roaches however (small brown roaches) are not native but they DO infest. Once you see one in your apartment it's over. Game over there's NOTHING you can do you will have approx 300,000 roaches in your place within the year. If you have a house you can place a huge tent over it and had the fuck out of your house several times a year (because the poison will not kill the eggs) you will have to throw out your furniture and maybe even televisions and computers and inspect your books thoroughly if you move to a new place.  If you live in an apartment building the best you can do is fight them off using poison tabs, traps, gels, boric acid etc but you will never fully exterminate them because they are already in every other apartment in that building. Game over   TL;DR: if the roaches are big and black (palmetto bugs) you should be ok, they're everywhere but don't infest.  If the roaches are small and brown (German roaches) game over. take off the nuke the site from orbit it's the only way to be sure ."
Miami,32zg28,SurgeHard,2,Sun Apr 19 22:26:20 2015 UTC,You can get rid of roaches is just expensive as hell. You can control then which is less expensive. The University of Miami has a research center for roaches. There is a guy who works in Miami who is the master of roach killing. He has all the cutting edge technology to kill bugs.

Miami,32zg28,Lukereddit5,2,Sun Apr 19 23:54:44 2015 UTC,"it would be impossible to find a place in Miami without roaches crawling around your house but there's many ways to prevent them over populating your house. First you need to understand that roaches can live without food for many months because they just eat their own body to survive (Yack Fucke them) but they can't live more than a week without any water. Make sure there's no any leak in the pipe underneath the sink, shower etc area...after that make sure you always clean the table after you eat becasue they love to eat little small crumbs of food. Also sweep the floor to eliminate their food supply. I also recommend you to clean the table/floor or House with harsh chemicals becasue they like sticky surface but DO NOT clean it with water cuz they like water!!! Make sure your trash can have a lid so that they can't go in and of course always throw away your trash regularly becasue if they smell something stinky in your house they gonna have a party in your house when your asleep."

I do have a couple of suggestions though:   You may want to consolidate some of the categories (e.g. combine Ideas, Editorial Cartoons and Columnist View into a category called Editorials).  More to the point, don't let your list of Categories get out of control (I'm having trouble thinking of very many pieces you cat fit under Automotive).  Decide on a few and do your best to fit every article into one of them. I really like that you have a Daily Weather Report.  I would probably prefer a graphic as opposed to a video though. It would be nice if you also had a daily listing of events. As you add things, do your best to keep the page from appearing cluttered.  Think about how clean Google.com looks compared to Yahoo.com.   Keep it up.  I would love to see a credible alternative to the Miami New times and the Herald."

Not everyone at good schools will get a high LSAT, and certainly won't get a high GPA.   I graduated UM Law recently. Most of my friends did not come from ivy league schools or anything. I would say the most prominent schools at UM were UF, FSU, UM and FIU. Sure a few Penn grads here and there, one from NYU etc.. but nothing crazy. Also some people who do well with their GPA and LSAT would rather go to school with a scholarship than pay money and go to a better school.   Lastly, UM Law is the a good school to go to if you want to practice in South Florida. I am sure many of those people from top undergrads are from Miami and just want to come back home and work here. UM is a good place to go. But really the most popular undergrad schools by a vast majority are Florida schools, FIU, FSU, UF, UM."

Miami,32dvc0,vitaminKsGood4u,1 point,Tue Apr 14 02:04:55 2015 UTC,You have to check airspace maps to see what is restricted airspace (obviously near an airport would be) and what is unrestricted (The only places I know near the coast that may be problematic are near military bases). Unrestricted space is pretty much all yours to play with and restricted airspace on a map will have the info you need to ask for permission on the map.

And you think Cuba and its people will benefit from this? Have you read a newspaper or online paper in the last three months. The number of arrested dissidents increases every week. People are still prosecuted for expressing their beliefs freely. Real Cuban? Any type of Cuban is a real Cuban.

Do you know how ridiculous you sound? Cuba's problems are in existence because of Cuba's government. Cuba's problems stem from a destructive government known as communism.   Also, I'm sure that if Iraq, let's say, takes/dominates your country the USA, I'm sure you'd want them dead/removed/etc."
Miami,31y2zw,calle_8,3,Thu Apr 9 17:08:32 2015 UTC,"Sure the Cuban government is partly to be blamed, but the exiled have never wanted the embargo to be lifted, further destroying any hope of economic growth in ""their"" country.   Things are changing slowly now though."
Miami,31y2zw,conenubi701,2,Thu Apr 9 17:17:55 2015 UTC,"You blame the embargo once more for Cuba's problems. The only person to blame is Fidel and his band of communists. All they had to do was relinquish power or change their government. But no. They'd rather kill 11 million Cubans then admit their government system is a failure, which it is. Cuba is one of the least-advanced countries in the world. Cuba is so far behind everything that it will take decades to bring the Cuban people, my people, up to date. Do you know why? Not because of the embargo, nor the US, but because of communism.   Things are changing? Did you know that less than a week after Obama announced the reestablishment of relations between both countries, the Cuban government took down a boat carrying 30+ men, women, elderly, and children trying to make it to the US? They shot it down and it burned up. Did you know that more than two dozens of Damas de Blanco were arrested two weeks ago? Did you know that two women who protested in the streets about a week ago were arrested, simply for speaking their mind? Did you know that a government official pulled a gun on a dissident for protesting a month ago? Did you know a high ranking Cuban official announced a few months ago that Cuba is not for the Cuban Americans or the exiled? Meaning that what is in Cuba, is not for us. That we are not welcome there. What is changing? That Cuba will make more money now? Yes, that is true, they will make more money now. Do you know where that money will go? To the government only. As does all money go to in Communist countries."

Answer the question.  And not that it is relevant but what the US should do is pause relations with Cuba. What has Cuba done to deserve this gesture? Your mind is probably so fixated on offending exiles you won't even look back at Cuba's history and see what they have done to the US and Cubans since Castro came. Educate your mind before blurting idiotic comments and offenses.

Also, if you've ever been to Cuba and witnessed first hand a Damas De Blanco protest you'd realize they antagonize the hell out of the police. Like most protesters in the states would get arrested if they got into the faces of police and started shoving them.  Did you know a police officer pulled a gun on a Ferguson protester like everyday? Quit over exaggerating.  Edit: Oh, and I would hope they would say its not for the exiled or the Cuban Americans. Good, That's how its supposed to be, for the Cuban people IN CUBA not the people outside of Cuba."
Miami,31y2zw,conenubi701,0,Thu Apr 9 21:22:22 2015 UTC,"okay. I have to call you out on your propaganda now. http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/cuba/article4711515.html Yeah, they shot at it and burned it down. Sure....   Your mind seems like it doesn't understand spanish nor care for it so you probably did not hear about it but Radio Mambi, a radio station in Miami, announced 5 days after the US-Cuba relations announcement, that a ship carrying 30+ women, children, men, and elderly was shot down off the coast of Matanzas, a province in Cuba. Before you hint I am lying, look it up. Oh, I'm sorry, you probably won't. You hate the Cuban exiles so much that you will never turn on the 710 radio station.    Also, if you've ever been to Cuba and witnessed first hand a Damas De Blanco protest you'd realize they antagonize the hell out of the police. Like most protesters in the states would get arrested if they got into the faces of police and started shoving them.   Of course I've been to Cuba. I am Cuban. What you have in this reply is entirely false. Do you think everyone is backwards and ignorant and living at a time where internet is unavailable? All you have to do is go to Youtube and look up a Damas de Blanco protest. Most, if not all, of the videos of the protests demonstrate peacefulness by their part. Does your mind know they received an important and prestigious award because of this, among other reasons? They antagonize the hell out of the place because they have a different opinion than the dictators in charge. Does your mind not comprehend Cuba is a communism and freedom of speech is illegal in Cuba? They don't shove anyone. Where do you get your information? From the trailer park? Look up their protests on Youtube or better yet, visit Cuba once more (If you have at all) and spectate a protest. There is no violence on their part. On the contrary. The violence comes from the government and their official. Educate yourself.   Did you know a police officer pulled a gun on a Ferguson protester like everyday? Quit over exaggerating.   Who is talking about Ferguson? The fact that you bring an outside example further demonstrates your position in this argument. And that is the losing side. Also, not that it matters but it is proven that protesters in Ferguson were extremely hostile to the police. They threw projectiles and were carrying concealed weapons and other things as well as shouting death threats to the police. In Cuba, that is not possible. In Cuba, no one has weapons. No one can throw or shout things to the police like the protesters of Ferguson. They cannot. Does your mind know why? Because doing so results in a treason/traitor accusation and an execution. Or a 5-20 year prison sentence.   Judging from all of your replies, you need a tremendous education on the situation of Cuba and we the exiled, and you obviously don't have it."
Miami,31y2zw,calle_8,-5,Mon Apr 13 17:09:41 2015 UTC,"First of all, you did not specify in your original comment. 'Specifying' now, at this point, will not help your argument any more. Secondly, you addressed the exiled community as a whole in your original comment, claiming they are not 'real' Cubans or Cubans at all, as well as saying that they have done nothing for their country when in fact that is not true; I will choose the Bay of Pigs as an example.  As for the article; the article you linked is childish because 1) China is in no way similar to Cuba besides having a single-party state. And as far as I know, China never stole property from the USA. 2) It is hilarious how they criticize a trip by the cuban-american politicians and try to form it as some sort of reason why they are 'phonies.' 3) The article claims Cuba's human rights records is improving. This is not true. I'd recommend 14ymedio or any real, non-propaganda newspaper to read why not. Did you know that almost every Sunday when las Damas de Blanco/Ladies in White march against Cuba's oppresion, they are arrested for speaking their mind. This happened last Sunday, and the sunday before that, and before that.   And yes, judging by your comments, you hate the Cuban community or at least the exiled part. Again, educate yourself on what the exiled have done."

Miami,31y2zw,conenubi701,-3,Thu Apr 9 17:05:24 2015 UTC,"Notice how you replied to a portion of my response. An exiled is a Cuban just like a Cuban in Cuba is a Cuban. Don't mix words up in a dumb way. You specifically said proud exiled are not Cubans. Not that there was pride in being exiled. Notice the difference? Why is the Bay of Pigs not good enough as an example? Because it was 50 years ago? Who are you to set the standards for examples? Any example is a valid example. You simply are at a loss of explanations and result to childish replies.    Sorry pipo   Pipo? Jaja callate, tolete ignorante.  We exiled are Cubans like an Cuban in Cuba.

Beach is 40-45 minutes (assuming there isn't traffic, which is always a poor assumption to make before 9 PM). If you move to the middle part of south Miami, East of the 826, north of Kendall Drive, West of 27th Ave and South of SW 8th street, you'll be able to find a 2 bedroom for under 1200 in a decent enough area that isn't straight ghetto.

Miami,31ughm,thirteenthirty7,5,Thu Apr 9 21:23:46 2015 UTC,"I actually go to Wolfson, as well as North & Kendall campus, and have dealt with this exact issue. Feel free to PM me with any other questions.  The Wolfson Campus is in the middle of downtown Miami. There's no way you would want, or afford to live downtown, so rule that out.   I HIGHLY recommend living near any Metro Rail station, then you can walk to the train, switch to the metro mover (downtown inner loop small trains) and be dropped off in front of the school (College North Station)  I live near the Viscaya station and it takes me 15-20 min to get from my house to class via the rails. It is faster than driving.   I recommend trying to find a station next to Viscaya or Coconut Grove station. They are nice areas and fairly central. Stay away from moving further south as traffic SUCKS! And Kendall is boring as hell. It's a giant suburb with no character. You want to live near downtown/brickell/wynwood/south beach for entertainment and venues.   I also go to the Kendall Campus often. There is no easy way to take public transit there. There is a train/bus combo that is convenient, but only during rush hour. So I have to drive there. It takes me usually 1 hour to drive from Viscaya Station to Kendall campus, for reference. The school is nice and large, but the students are very young as a whole. It's like high school 2.0.  The Wolfson campus is very, very diverse. I like that campus the most. North Campus is alright, but not for me. I also have to drive there.   As a student, you can buy a public transit monthly pass for half price, like $56 I think.   The area around Viscaya is very nice and quiet. Coconut Grove and and anything further south start to be college areas around UofM.   There are a few appt buildings right outside the viscaya station, I can snap a pic and send u if you like, maybe they'll have some units available.   Btw, I pay $1200 for a 1/1. I think you'd prob need at least $1500 for a 2/2. You may find those prices around town, but not near the train stations. Personally, I'd try to make living near the rails a priority, you will definitely not want to be driving into downtown miami very often with a car and deal with traffic and parking."

It's closer to University of Miami but it is close to the Metrorail that can take you right to MDC Wolfson combined with the metro mover.  It's in a good area and pretty cheap..1010 a month for a 1/1 and 1250 for a 2/1. I'm moving there myself in May and it's mostly younger professionals and college students there.

And as the least damaged vehicle of the bunch, I'm the lowest priority.

While the park's technically 'closed' after sunset, I've heard plenty of people ride then.  A full moon with no clouds - you can go without a bike light. I'd still bring one for sure in case of a mechanical problem.  Advice? bring anything else you'd normally bring on a 15-20 mile ride depending on weather.

Miami,31pj9b,MrPap,1 point,Fri Apr 10 03:00:07 2015 UTC,"I love Shark Valley. If you get there before it closes but are planning to stay until after it closes, make sure you park on the road instead of the parking lot!! Bring spare parts with you! many many times I've run into people biking at night and got a flat and didn't have a pump, spare tire, or a patch kit. It's a long walk back if you don't have the supplies you need. You can certainly go when it isn't a full moon - better to see the stars that way - whether or not its a full moon, bring a bike light or a head lamp. Check the wind direction before you go - it can be killer sometimes. Bring lots of water - there's none when you get past the parking ."

Brickell is right there, you walk a few blocks and you are in a good area but the difference is pretty dramatic in just a few blocks. I play basketball by the park there Jose Marti. Its a mix of characters socioeconomic classes at that park. We all get along though.   It will be affordable for a reason though. Again, if you are used to more typical U.S. middle class living then it will be a lot different. Its not a horrible crime area or anything like that though.

Every year setup a short meeting with your boss asking if you're doing a good job and if the boss sees where you can improve. Know your overall worth within the marketplace and the business. Ask the boss where his challenges lay within the coming year and see where you can fill a hole in the plan. Mention your annual successes and then stay quiet and wait for an answer. Keep emotions out of it. Facts are everything.

Miami,31fdai,ben5on,10,Sat Apr 4 15:36:21 2015 UTC,Craigslist
Miami,31fdai,NPSgator,6,Sat Apr 4 16:16:33 2015 UTC,Out west it's pretty easy to find rooms for rent for between $350 and $500 a month all utilities included. I just went on Miami-Dade Craigslist and put $800 in rooms and found a bunch of places all over the county. We just rented our second bedroom for $600 including utilities.
Miami,31fdai,annoyingbeggar,3,Sat Apr 4 21:07:18 2015 UTC,"Look on the UM offcampus housing website - you will find some listings there.  In my neighborhood people put up notices in the grocery store, so you might look in places like that.  Has Craigslist not worked for you?    You mentioned Hialeah in your other post, have you driven over in that area?  I must be honest with you - it is not easy to trust a stranger on the internet, people need to be able to get a sense of what kind of a person you are.  If someone posts something and there is not such a hurry and there is time to pm, then text, then talk on the phone, then people feel like they have a bit of control over what could happen.  But if you need a place tonight (right away!) then there is no room for getting to know someone a little before you let them into your home.    Did you say you have a van? Do people still use Walmart parking lots to park in over night?  I've done that while traveling with a van full of kids and it was fine.  Perhaps as a last resort, you could try that while you search for a place.    Good luck to you."
Miami,31fdai,tillandsia,2,Sat Apr 4 17:11:51 2015 UTC,Hey I really appreciate your response.  Craigslist hasn't really worked out for me. I've only come across places in pretty shady/sketchy areas that are in my price range.   I still don't feel comfortable sleeping in my van. I mean it's full of stuff so I'd be sleeping in the drivers seat...and I don't know where I could park to sleep anyways that's reasonably safe.  But thanks for the other advice.
Miami,31fdai,Thought-Starter,5,Sat Apr 4 18:00:17 2015 UTC,I hate to break it to you but your price range listed in the OP put into shady neighborhoods. Especially on such short notice.
Miami,31fdai,fruitball4u,2,Sat Apr 4 19:31:09 2015 UTC,"I don't live here anymore so I can't offer a place, but have you tried airbnb?  At the very least it'll be cleaner than a hostel until you can find a place to stay.   Edit: I've also seen people recommend finding a roommate but have yet to see you say you've looked. Try roommates.com  You can find a nice place for $1600 a month split in two - and may even be able to find a place for short term if you're looking to live on your own."
Miami,31fdai,beniceorbevice,2,Sat Apr 4 21:06:59 2015 UTC,"Hah, i done did the same exact thing last week, luckily i only had to do it for two nights but it was frustrating and scary as hell, i started talking to a woman that was offering a room in her condo for rent on craigslist while i was on my way down and met with her two days later. I got lucky for sure, if it wasn't for her i probably wouldn't have a place still. But good luck, look under rooms/shared on craigslist."
Miami,31fdai,beniceorbevice,1 point,Sat Apr 4 16:41:07 2015 UTC,What area could you find a place in?

Miami,31fdai,richieg7777,2,Sun Apr 5 00:13:25 2015 UTC,"If you really need to save some $$ not staying in a hostel you can just sleep in your car. Get a cheap gym membership at one of those 24 hour joints that have showers. Bum it in your car for a week or two. Buy a couple loafs of the cheap bread and whatever peanut butter is on sale for the week. Get a bottle of water (the biggest ones they sell at the gas station) and just keep it refilled. It's not glorious but it will get you through the rough patch.  I'm not sure how much a hostel is costing you per night, but perhaps weigh the options?"

Miami,31f0df,Fugazitron,2,Sat Apr 4 13:55:03 2015 UTC,"The difference is how your relationship with your landlord will be:  Renting an apartment: one landlord for many units. For some this is great because the landlord has to keep everyone happy and a good landlord doesn't want his tenants unionizing against bad management. For others it can be terrible if you have a terrible landlord who doesn't manage the property properly.  Renting a condo: one landlord for one unit and an association that governs the whole building. For some this is great because your issues become first priority when concerning your unit. For others this is terrible because if the issue affects more than your unit, you're at the mercy of the condo association. As a renter you'll have no control, and you'll be stuck with whatever circumstances your unit's owner leaves you with.  Ultimately what it comes down to: your landlord and your building. Research both, make sure your landlord will be able and available to address your needs should there be a plumbing issue or an appliance meltdown. See whether or not your building is up to code or about to be overhauled for construction. In my experience it's much more difficult renting a condo than it is to own one or rent an apartment."
Miami,31f0df,Dinosour,1 point,Sat Apr 4 14:54:51 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, so if I rented a condo from an absentee landlord who lived in Russia or Brazil, then I'd have a huge problem if there were an urgent plumbing or A/C issue. Thank you for your perspective!"
Miami,31f0df,StealthRUs,2,Sat Apr 4 23:35:19 2015 UTC,"Just have a clause in your lease that if they don't respond to your responses to fix problems within X amount of time, that you can fix the problems yourself and take it out of the rent.  Problem solved."
Miami,31f0df,Miamiunnative,2,Mon Apr 6 20:36:49 2015 UTC,Big difference is a condo is normally first last and security deposit for move in. Apartments are usually a month (or less if there's a special) and some association fees.

Miami,319pty,J_moody,2,Fri Apr 3 03:00:27 2015 UTC,"look up Bimini Superfast. I heard mixed reviews, but maybe others have better options."
Miami,319pty,ReallyFatPeopleOnTLC,2,Fri Apr 3 04:21:29 2015 UTC,"I actually went on the Bimini Superfast in August. It was..... alright. The weather sucked the day we went. Left at 9am, got to Bimini around 11. Got to the actual island at 12 due to th3 boats that take you there. They were unorganized. One train takes you to downtown Bimini which is 5 shops and a couple of restaurants and the other takes you through Resorts world resort. That place is still under construction so it's not the tropical feeling I was expecting. The beach was nice though, clear water, beautiful sand. Mind you, it was overcast and spotty showers the whole day. At 3pm, we had to be back at the Bimini port. I recommend getting there early so you can take the first ferry back to the ship because the second ferry has to wait for all the late comers :(. I recommend the cabin too, it's small do don't expect much, but it's better than carrying your bags around the whole ship.  In the end, I probably won't do that cruise again. Unless it were free :D the service was good though but idk, for the price and the time we spent in Bimini, it wasn't worth it."

Miami,319pty,ProfessorAnal,2,Fri Apr 3 15:07:40 2015 UTC,Supposedly there's a ferry out of Port Everglades that gives you more than a few hours in Grand Bahama. You get off the boat at 11 am in Grand Bahama and depart at 7 pm. That sounds like a pretty solid trip to me but I've read that their older ferry was junky and had terrible service. I haven't heard anything about the new boat yet though.   http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/news/bahama-mama-cruise-ferry-from-fort-lauderdale-to-grand-bahamas-set-to-launch-6450913

Miami,314pjx,ReallyFatPeopleOnTLC,1 point,Thu Apr 2 11:35:35 2015 UTC,"ight, yea looking at finally getting my PPL but just trying to figure out the logistics. Been wanting to do it since I was a kid. Not looking to make a career out of it though, thinking I would prefer to train in a SR-20 or DA20. As much as I heard a C-172 steam gauge is the way to go, there is just something about the older 172s I don't trust."
Miami,314pjx,bax101,2,Thu Apr 2 13:58:13 2015 UTC,"Trust? Those aircraft are pretty solid and learning steam gauge is pretty important to learn. The basic ""T"" is something I would think is better to be familiar with in an event of an emergency in the air. Like your computer screens turning off on in flight. I knw that has happened before with the Cirrus aircraft when I used to work on them. The CPU burned out and the screens went blank. Although there is an AD for it now so it's a fixed item. The Diamonds seems like a better low wing aircraft to learn in.   You should trust the 172 they are work horses. Just watch your head."
Miami,314pjx,skeptikalz,1 point,Thu Apr 2 16:54:54 2015 UTC,"Just watch your head.   That's what people tell me. And if I was in this to start a career I would be going with it as they are cheaper, and a staple of any flight school. The one thing I have the most apprehension about is TCAS. The only light GA flying I have ever done is in a fairly new Cessna 206T with G1000. But going around training areas, MIA, the beach without TCAS just seems crazy. I know mid air are not a common phenomenon but there is just something about them compared to an engine failure that make me more apprehensive about older aircraft.   We will see. Need to figure out where/when I want to start training."
Miami,314pjx,_Andreas_,1 point,Thu Apr 2 17:15:28 2015 UTC,"1) The 172 is a trainer for a reason...they take a beating.  The SR-20 is a somewhat delicate airplane.  2) The 172 will literally save you thousands off of flight training.  Forget about steam.  I trained in the G1000 version.  It's easier to jump into steam from glass that the other way around (IMO).  3) The 172 is spin certified making it safer, with little effort you can correct a spin.  The SR-20 is not and thats the main reason for the CAPS.  Its not as stable in slow flight.  Also, a lot of your flying will be done under the safe deployable altitude of the CAPS (2,000').  Someone can look that up to double check.  4) I prefer the view a high wing gives you.  5) Take a discovery flight in both.  If you're going to invest thousands in flight training you might as well drop a couple of hundred up front to take a flight in each.  6) All of that said, I love the SR-20.  Its sexier and much nicer on the inside.  However, I also love the classic lines of the good old 172.  If I had the extra thousands I would have probably gone with the SR-20.  I am very happy being a weekend warrior.  I encourage you to take the step.  Ill take you in the 172 to see how you like it.  Also, forget proper schooling.  You can learn ground yourself as you go.  Just pick an instructor whose personality you like.  You are trusting someone with your life and training.  You will be listening to this person for hours in your ears.  You will need to laugh together, learn, and rub shoulders with this person.  You might as well like them.  Cheers!"

Go scuba diving in the Keys, while your on your way down, stop at Coral Castle to hear an interesting tale and see some cool stuff.  Head down to Homestead and check out Knaus Berry Farm, pick some fruit and enjoy some of the best milk shakes around.  Got your hands on a bike?

Miami,317pt3,kittehcama,1 point,Thu Apr 2 20:37:03 2015 UTC,"Hi MackerelInTomato,  The best time to visit Miami is between January until the end of March. I would say the best month is February. All the other months are unbearably hot and rainy (we get A LOT of rain in the summer). And since you're a tourist I'm sure you'll be outside a lot so why spend your vacation hot and sticky.  Places to check out:  *Lincoln Road in South Beach: it's filled with restaurants and shops, it's basically an outdoor mall. Some food options there:       -Try Shake Shack for delicious burgers and shakes       -The Frieze Ice Cream shop for dessert       -Juvia is a pricey sushi place with amazing views       - Sushi Siam for delicious sushi       - Books and Books cafe for healthier options (sandwiches salads)  *Ocean Drive and Washington Ave in South Beach: You can go to the beach and get drinks along Ocean Drive (Wet Willies). Washington Ave has clubs but have a plan of action to get in before hand especially if you're a guy.           -Must try SoBe restaurant is Joe's Stone Crab (obviously get the stone crab)           -Nikki Beach- the food is average but the scenery is nice  *Brickell in downtown Miami: upscale area, Trulucks Restaurant has a happy hour. There are lots of lounges. Check out Mary Brickell Village.   *Vizcaya in Coconut Grove, then check out Kennedy Park (also in Coconut Grove) and get an icy from the A/Cs Icees truck. Then take a drive over Rickenbacker and check out the Rusty Pelican for dinner (pricey)  *If you want to go more north check out the Seminole Hard Rock (casino, clubs)  By the way, you definitely will need to rent a car. Once you have a car you can go anywhere and everywhere, even a trip to Key West if you wanted to for a weekend. Just be careful not to get towed in South Beach and always pay the parking meters! You will get a ticket! (Pay to park is about $1.75 an hour, DO NOT PAY $15/$20 TO PARK ANYWHERE!)   If you have any questions PM me."
Miami,317pt3,TheWittyWarlock,1 point,Thu Apr 2 20:21:02 2015 UTC,"Hey! Thanks for the detailed explenation! Since Februrary is over, and we are already in april, this kinda sucks. but I'll keep in mind the hot stickiness. I was in Dubai in 2013, and if it isn't hotter than that, I think I will be fine.  When you say pricey sushi, what is pricy? Because here in Norway, the cheapest you get is like, 15 USD for 12 bites, so over 1 dollar a bite.   I would like to check out some night clubs and so forth. What is the average taxi price in Miami? Im not very comfortable driving you see."
Miami,317pt3,halathon,1 point,Thu Apr 2 20:34:30 2015 UTC,"I honestly would not visit Miami in June, July or even August because we get a thunderstorms about 4 out of 7 days a week in those months. So I would either visit as soon as possible (May?) or hold off until October (will still be really hot). Possibly November? You can go to the beach here year round except for about maybe 5 ""cold"" days a year where it's 60 degree F.     This is not a city you would want to take a taxi everywhere for, as things are very spread out. You might want to check out Uber, it's the newest thing here and cheaper than a taxi.  https://www.uber.com/cities/miami  Or you might want to plan your trip so you're in one area per day to save money. For example, if you go to South Beach stay in South Beach for the day and take short taxi rides. Or maybe you can find a driver for a set price? I honestly have no idea what taxi prices are because everyone here owns a car. Our city transportation isn't the best either.   I guess sushi would be cheaper here for you or about the same. It really depends on where you go. Drinks in Miami are expensive about $14 to $17 USD (depending where you go). We have a lot of great food from a lot of different ethnics here. Cuban food is something you should try.   It all really depends on how many days you're here and what you want to see and do."
Miami,317pt3,TheWittyWarlock,1 point,Thu Apr 2 21:19:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks again for much details. October sounds good, and November would be perfect (My birthday is in November).   $17 is actually quite high. Higher than Norway. Heck, even $14 is high.   I'll check out the uber app, it recently hit Norway as well, but has gotten a lot of hassle.   I plan to stay for at least a week."
Miami,317pt3,halathon,1 point,Thu Apr 2 21:46:06 2015 UTC,"Rent a car; roughly some $30+ dollars a day plus gas.

Miami,30w6lg,Kruzat,16,Tue Mar 31 04:54:53 2015 UTC,"Miami has tons of major issues.   It also has tons of great positives. Name a big city, and find people living there and they will tell you all the things wrong with it. And I am talking big cities, not Denver or Austin Tx. There are only a select few metros in the 4 million population range. Miami is one of them and Miami has the least amount of develop-able land of all of them too.   I am not saying all things will become great one day, but lets keep in mind Miami was incorporated in 1896 by that time San Fran, Chicago, Boston, NYC, D.C. Philly were all major cities by then. Miami is just at the maturing point that many cities were 50-80 years ago. Look at the major cities in the Western Hemisphere with metro populations in the 3-5 million and plus. Someone correct me if I am wrong but Miami is the youngest one on the list.   We can see the transformation happening before our eyes. Does Miami has a ton of issues. You bet! But is it s a pretty awesome place to live? You bet."
Miami,30w6lg,Flymia,6,Tue Mar 31 16:36:41 2015 UTC,Miami does not need more land we need density.
Miami,30w6lg,expresswayvisual,6,Tue Mar 31 16:47:48 2015 UTC,"I agree. But if we compare Miami to cities its age, it is very dense. Look at Miami and other cities in the South or newer metros like Las Vegas, Houston, Dallas, San Diego, Atlanta, Charlotte, Denver.   Miami is the most dense of them all. We need to stop comparing Miami to NYC, DC, Boston etc.. Its not those cities, and never will be, different history, different geography."
Miami,30w6lg,Flymia,3,Tue Mar 31 17:25:22 2015 UTC,"Miami needs smart planning. Our public transport is just down right awful. We only recently connected the metrorail to the airport. Think about that, the International airport that is a major international hub had no connection to the only train system we had for 90+% of existence. And we are becoming more dense as a city, but thats not a good thing, it just creates more traffic as we build more condos/apartments and don't improve our public transit."
Miami,30w6lg,lgm1213,3,Tue Mar 31 22:57:43 2015 UTC,"Urban history indicates that public transit needs to come as a response to density.  When cities develop transit in hopes that density will result to make it economically viable, it often never happens and the transit goes under utilized.    Yes miami needs better transit, and it will happen in time.  People want an their city to be a microwave dinner instead of appreciating the prep and cooking that is currently happening.    Miami is way younger and earlier in its development than most better transit-oriented cities people want to compare it to.  There are plans in the works for rapid bus transit, metro expansions, regional train expansion, etc.  Just recently a study came out naming Miami 26th of the US's 30 largest cities when it comes to walk ability. But that same study also need Miami fourth out of those cities in regards to future walk ability.  Shits happening.  Enjoy the process and join it rather than lamenting and nitpicking"

Miami,30w6lg,lgm1213,2,Wed Apr 1 12:52:08 2015 UTC,"Expansion Would've been great.  But the reality is ridership numbers and population density in downtown didn't really justify it at the time.  There has definitely been some failures, but there's also clear progress, and stuff in the works.  As I've stated before, the biggest transit spending failures occur when cities build transit in hopes that it will attract the density to make it viable."
Miami,30w6lg,yrogreg,2,Wed Apr 1 13:47:59 2015 UTC,"I really hate that they didn't bother to connect the tri-rail to the actual airport in Ft. Lauderdale.  I would actually use that as a transportation method if I didn't have to rely on a stupid bus once I get to the station.  I guess it's too late to change that now though.   Also, I really hope they start inputting more bike lanes.  I bike to and from work fairly often, which I love since it saves me from the traffic but it's pretty terrifying having to share the roads with all the south florida maniacs...I mean drivers."

Miami,30w6lg,Rolk17,5,Tue Mar 31 11:29:47 2015 UTC,Exactly. The problem is just how squished we are and the  terrible transportation system here.. Good luck going anywhere else outside downtown Miami and the beach and the other way around without a car. Even with a car it's a big pain just trying to get from one area to another.
Miami,30w6lg,motoryry,7,Tue Mar 31 11:41:21 2015 UTC,Almost every major city in the US is urbanized in their urban core and sprawled outside of it.  I don't know what you're expecting.  Plus downtown paired with Brickell is a pretty significant area.  Miami is still developing.  Eventually the gaps will fill in between downtown and midtown.  Eventually the gaps will fill in between the Marlins Park area and downtown.  Have you been to downtown Gables?  It's great.  The grove?
Miami,30w6lg,yrogreg,2,Tue Mar 31 13:29:24 2015 UTC,"I grew up in Miami and moved to Chicago. Chicago has sprawl. The metro area extends across three states and houses almost 10 million people. And if I needed to get anywhere in that area, I can do it with one or a combination of urban elevated trains, urban and suburban bus routes, and inter-town metra passenger trains, all within a reasonable timeframe. That's aside from national systems like Amtrak, which still has stops within the metro area. Plus, there are bike routes with marked lanes all across the city, like the ones I took to work this morning. I've lived here for 8 years, haven't had a car in that time, and don't want one.  Chicago may have a leg up on other cities when it comes to public transit, but this is not unique to Chicago. Most major cities have forms that extend throughout the metro areas (Texas' and other southern cities seem to make up most of the exception). Miami? What little they do have is worthless if you're not in or very close to downtown. Which practically no one lives in, anyway. While I was in college, my parents moved from Miami Springs to Miramar. Without a car, I might as well be on another continent. Edit: Literally. Google says it would take three and a half hours to go from their new house to the old one with public transit, which wouldn't be an option at night because of their operating hours. Or I could fly from Columbia or Venezuela into MIA and take a cab to the Springs in that time."
Miami,30w6lg,jvalordv,5,Tue Mar 31 15:18:00 2015 UTC,"Well Miramar is in Broward so you're pushing it.  But, in terms of American cities, it's pretty much broken down like this:  1.) Big city that emerged before the advent of the automobile and you will have a more established walkable urban area with transit and walkability ingrained into the identity of the city.  2.) Big city that emerged after (or along with) the advent of the automobile and you will be largely characterized by sprawl.  This is not unique to Miami (no matter how bad self-loathing Miamians looking to project their displeasure onto something else want to think it is).  This characterizes most sunbelt cities and much of California.  The people that love to complain on this subreddit have some sort of warped sense of reality where they just expect things to change overnight.  Miami is progressing amazingly in terms of developing a strong and increasingly attractive and vibrant urban core.  It's just that most initiatives that influence a city's evolution take place gradually over years.  Miami will be a very different place in 10-15 years.  This is best characterized by the following:   A recent Smart Growth America ranking of walkable urbanism among the 30 largest U.S. metros listed Miami 23rd, just behind Detroit. But Miami's potential is much brighter‚Äîranked 4th on the same report's ""future"" walkability list‚Äîand a new project to transform a major downtown corridor takes a strong step in that direction.   My message to disgruntled Miamians who can't see past their own personal issues:  instead of bitching about everything, be part of the progress happening in Miami.  It's an exciting time to be here.  Stuff is happening.  Stake your claim in the emerging city."

One has far better public and alternative transit options. Which is the real issue for me here.  Miami needs better infrastructure to evolve, especially now that the city itself has rapidly urbanized and there are towers everywhere. Do you think that what public/alternative transit options currently exist there are useful? If not, do you think that the current system of cars-or-nothing is sustainable?"
Miami,30w6lg,jvalordv,3,Tue Mar 31 18:30:30 2015 UTC,First: Colombia not Columbia.  Second:  you should do a little more research before saying no one lives in downtown Miami.

Second: I got off mobile just so I could do that research you requested more easily. Wikipedia says that there are 81,000 permanent residents in all of downtown Miami with a density of 21,315 per sq mile. Where I live in Rogers Park, a sleepy residential/college neighborhood on the very edge of what constitutes Chicago proper, there are 55,000 residents at 30,000 people per sq mile. Downtown Miami only constitutes some 20% of the total population of the (still relatively small) City of Miami, which itself only has some 417,000 people, about half that of Jacksonville. Can you really say that downtown Miami is home to a substantial number of people?"

A couple of restaurants and tourist traps doesn't make it a nice place to live. The Everglades is a crucial ecosystem, but as far as experiencing it goes, it's mostly inaccessible wetland.  The sprawl and lack of mobility make Dade County a really shitty place to live if you don't have thousands of dollars to waste on the very fuel that's making Florida hotter and lower compared to sea level. If you live anywhere other than Miami or Miami Beach, just walking outside is a bad experience because it's hot and we cut down all the trees and there's nowhere to go except the private property of strangers. South Florida can be beautiful if we increase population density, nurture our ecosystems, abandon the suburbs so that they can turn back into forests, invest in public transport, and build mounds so that we can stay dry after sea level rise, then maybe we can make this a nice place to live. Until then, pretty much all of South Florida is just a hot, inaccessible concrete slab."

My girlfriend was always nice to her tho because, come on, that poor girl was bullied into a life of introversion loneliness. But anyway, that's as much as I know.

Miami,30xuy5,cannabal420,2,Wed Apr 1 23:15:28 2015 UTC,"Idk if you're being sarcastic, but let me ask you this: have you ever been bullied?  If so, then you know how this girl probably felt about being bullied. Obviously stabbing somebody as revenge isn't the proper way to react, but I still sympathize with the girl because I know what it's like to be bullied. It's one of the worst feelings ever when someone puts you down. But I also feel bad for the guy who got stabbed because he didn't know what he was causing that poor girl, and he definitely had no idea what he had coming. You have to look at it from both sides because, first of all, these are basically children who really don't understand the consequences that may arise from certain actions, and second of all because these are also sentient beings like you and I that can be affected by the words and actions of others."

Grab the low hanging fruit. If you're looking for a place, PM me, using a realtor is a free service and will save you a lot of time/frustration."
Miami,30x2qo,dcht,1 point,Wed Apr 1 02:01:49 2015 UTC,"I negotiated from $1800 to $1700. It's going to be tough, but take a look at prices in other units in the building, and find reasons why your unit should be cheaper. For me my unit was only on the 12th floor (so not a great view, and I could hear noise from the ground level), it's above the gym so I can hear the music there all day long and hear weights dropping, my unit hasn't been renovated in 10 years so it's not as nice as other units. Just really focus on the location of your unit, is it near the elevators (you could hear the annoying noise from them), is the parking far away from the unit?, etc."

Miami,30t3ln,Dangotron,1 point,Tue Mar 31 17:14:45 2015 UTC,"The weather in Miami is obviously the best thing it has going for it, and believe me, I do love the weather. Being able to walk outside in shorts ~360 days of the year is amazing. There's so many things to do outside. But, there's plenty of things about Miami I can't stand.  Most people will agree with me - the #1 thing I hate about Miami is the people. The people here are assholes. Plain and simple. You're more likely to be given the finger than to be waved at. The drivers are assholes, they don't use their turn signal, and will cut you off. It's incredibly hard to meet people and make friends. If you're not into staying out until 6am clubbing, you're at a huge disadvantage. It's tough to find decent nightlife where you can just hang out at a local pub and drink with friends.  Service in Miami is terrible, most people don't even say hi to you when you walk into their store. Try to talk with them? Nope, ain't gonna happen. 3 words don't exist in Miami: hello, please, thank you.  The other thing is that people in Miami have this self-centered attitude where they have to be the best and will treat you like shit in order for them to be on top.  Now visiting Miami is another story. Most of the people you're meeting are either tourists from other cities, or you're on South Beach where all the businesses do is cater to tourists. When you visit Miami you're only here for a few days or a week, and it's great. Great weather, good variety of food, good nightlife (although I'd argue it isn't good). You're in, you're out, and you don't have to deal with all the assholes the rest of year when there aren't as many tourists.  Just my 2 cents but I feel as though most people who have a negative view towards Miami will agree with me."

Miami,30t3ln,13104598210,2,Mon Mar 30 20:41:38 2015 UTC,"Why did I even think to hope I might come on here and not find a bunch of whiny, bitchy Ultra bashers?  We get it;your old as fuck, or boring as fuck, or both - and anyone who's not deserves to die.   The thing is, us Ultrians don't. give. a. fuck. We are just sad that some of you will never know what it is to plug in to that massive boil of positive soul energy that lifts you up and shows you this life is a whole lot more than traffic and high-up apartments (yeah I'm talking to you).  Life is about the little moments that help you remember that you are nothing but a dust mite among dust, and you've been given an opportunity to enjoy this universe for a small while.   At the end of the day, that's what Ultra (and music festivals in general) are all about."
Miami,30t3ln,zewm426,3,Mon Mar 30 20:14:15 2015 UTC,"I don't mind people that criticize those who go to Ultra, especially those who think everyone who goes there are crackheads and sexmaniacs, even though it gets annoying at times. They should respect and acknowledge that all kinds of people go to that festival, even though I admit that there are drugs in the festival.  I just happen to really enjoy EDM and I don't do drugs or tobacco, nor I'm a sexmaniac or an alcoholic, and I came with my friends which don't do those things also, and we had a blast."
Miami,30t3ln,13104598210,3,Tue Mar 31 17:17:02 2015 UTC,"Exactly! It's a place where you can come and do you, and if doing you is getting hopped up on uppers or banging as many girls as you can in one place, go for it. I mean let's be honest, there are few places where that is ""encouraged,"" and Ultra provides a release, if you will, for that segment of people.  But man, to just be surrounded by all those people singing along to words that were written to be sung like that; there are few things that are as epic.  But I definitely mind anyone who criticizes people for doing things they don't like to do. It's not like I sit here and criticize old farts for hoarding money and buying property that they don't really need just because it makes them happy."

Miami,30ulha,zewm426,2,Mon Mar 30 21:37:14 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on the age range of the couple, money you have to spend, transport options, etc. You need to provide a few more details for us to narrow down our advice.  However, general rules about first dates is that they shouldn't be TOO committal or extravagant. You don't know the person yet, the purpose of a first date is to assess if you enjoy each other's company and then move forward from there.  Try something simple like a coffee shop (Cliche, I know) or (if you're 21+) a casual drinking establishment. Something like Fat Tuesdays in the Grove that has open air seating and isn't too fancy and the music isn't too loud before the night crowd gets there. Just a decent place to have a chat.  Don't do things like a movie theatre where there isn't really room for conversation (although in Miami that's questionable).  I hope this helps you narrow down an idea for a place to go for a first date. If you give a few more details about he situation I'm sure we can give you a more detailed response."

The couchsurfing weekly meetups are usually on south beach and we went to one a few weeks ago that was fun. It is kind've difficult to meet people here admittedly but we really like living on the beach. We joined a book club that meets once a month and signed up for a bowling league that starts in a few weeks. There's also group tennis clinics nightly at Flamingo Park for intermediate and above. Lastly, a midwesterners meetup that my girlfriend has been to that was good. If you any of these interest you I can send you some links. Good luck and enjoy the beach!"

Also there dumbbells only go up to 100lb. For comparison, my old gym back in ny was probably 4x the size of steel gym, 5x the size if the aerobics room and tanning rooms and sauna are counted.

The ONLY residential property still standi on sw11 st. There is a shoddy house. The caretaker's name is Ishmael, his wife lives there with him and is a painter. The decrepit building contains hundreds of her paintings. The back yard has been excavated and what was uncovered is an ancient prehistoric earthen ""cork"" of sorts which plugged a hole to an underground spring. The large rock formations which make up the rear of the property appear to be filled with petrified pieces of different animal bones. Ishmael claims that local Native American shaman confirmed the spot as an ancient sacred site. Ishmael has a pump setup to where he can remove the cork and fill the excavated rock crevices of the backyard with water from the spring. A truly unique place altogether. If you ride the metromover to or from the brickell metrorail station you can see the house amid many businessess its roof and walls covered in colorful murals.

Nobody rides their fucking bike to work or to get groceries. It is too fucking hot ten months out of the year and the weather is too unpredictable. And yes i'm sure there are a handful of people that actually do that (some of the time anyway) but those people either work with a change of clothes and a shower or in a seriously unprofessional environment. Id's say easily 95% of people in Miami don't have or don't exercise that option.

Often times, the sidewalk is wide open, and with room for a cyclists and pedestrians to move about without conflict. At worst, a cyclist has to ride on someone's grass for a few seconds. Having been in two car/bike accidents before I moved down here, and seen how people drive, I'd rather risk getting a ticket or getting yelled at for taking the sidewalk versus going on the road."
Miami,30d98f,billywob,9,Thu Mar 26 22:14:27 2015 UTC,Sidewalks are the most unsafe place for a cyclist. Cars do not expect anything moving faster than walking pace and do not look when crossing sidewalks.
Miami,30d98f,IAMHOLLYWOOD_23,0,Thu Mar 26 23:21:11 2015 UTC,"Cars barely look when they're d living straight. At least when they're crossing a sidewalk, they're usually at a low speed."

Miami,30d98f,capnqrunch,2,Thu Mar 26 20:16:56 2015 UTC,"How are they passing you? You don't just mean claiming a lane while riding in traffic, right? Cyclists are part of traffic, so they should stop and yield for traffic, as traffic must do for them. Cars should sometimes either stop or yield for cyclists for safety and traffic flow reasons. If cyclists are ignoring stop order or not signaling with ample warning though, that is a problem for which I'd be fine with legislative solutions.   Just to be clear, I see that you bike and I don't mean to assume you don't know any of this. I just saw your comment as an opportunity to elaborate on something that some people might not know."
Miami,30d98f,cyber_officer,2,Thu Mar 26 20:23:32 2015 UTC,"Wait, so your mad at cyclist for signaling intent, albeit late?"
Miami,30d98f,IAMHOLLYWOOD_23,2,Thu Mar 26 22:15:08 2015 UTC,"It's not the proper thing to do at all. Could be safer in some situations. But, how often do you see empty intersections in Miami? You might be there until 4am in most intersections if you wait for it to clear out. I'm really curious about why you keep saying a bicyclist ""threw themselves on"" your car. What the heck happened?"
Miami,30d98f,YeaISeddit,1 point,Thu Mar 26 22:21:21 2015 UTC,"It isn't. This is what causes motorists to think that bicyclists are 'unpredictable'. Everyone has to do the same thing when on a bike. If people on bicycles are expected to signal, which is what you are implying by your previous comments, then you should be signaling when on a bike as well. Let's keep it consistent for the sake of everyone's safety."
Miami,30d98f,mana_tease,1 point,Thu Mar 26 23:24:53 2015 UTC,"cyclists not signaling with ample warning. This happened to me twice in a week, which almost caused an accident, both times   I think a more accurate statement would be ""motorists not signaling with ample warning. This happened to me twenty five times in a week, which almost caused an accident twenty five times.""  The issue is not the signaling on the part of the cyclists-- it is people on their phones, not paying attention, and not looking for cyclists. It is a shared responsibility to keep everyone safe and it is silly to think otherwise."
Miami,30d98f,mana_tease,1 point,Thu Mar 26 23:48:01 2015 UTC,"Ok...so let me ask you. Let's say I'm biking down Ponce or Miracle Mile. I can't/shouldn't be on the sidewalk. Cars are parallel parked on either side of the street. 2 lanes of traffic in each direction. What are my options in that about 12""s of space between the right lane of traffic and the rows of parked cars?"
Miami,30d98f,Pituquasi,2,Fri Mar 27 06:03:16 2015 UTC,The thing you have to consider as a cyclist is that just because you're right doesn't mean you won't be killed. Don't trust anyone with your safety. Especially not in this city where nobody cares about anyone else.

Miami,30ditr,julieago,5,Thu Mar 26 14:30:42 2015 UTC,"Where you want to live obviously will depend on your budget. The budget you posted gives you a lot of options, but it also depends on other factors like:   How old are you? Are you looking for a house, or condo/apt? Would you want a roommate? Suburban or more urban? Close to beach or no?   So, TL DR: it depends."
Miami,30ditr,SurlyDuffBeer,3,Thu Mar 26 15:01:48 2015 UTC,"I'm a 27 year old female. I am not picky about house/condo/apt, but if I had to choose a preference, probably a condo or townhouse. Yes, I would want to be very close to the beach."
Miami,30ditr,SurlyDuffBeer,9,Thu Mar 26 15:06:37 2015 UTC,"Based on the areas you say you need to travel to, and your budget and age, I'd strongly recommend you live in Brickell. With that kind of budget you shouldn't have an issue finding a decent place. If you are open to getting a roommate, you can get a REALLY nice place.  Brickell has tons of stuff to do, especially for 20-somethings. Lots of condos to rent. Close to I-95, which lets you get to Miami Beach easily, and it's about 15 minutes from MIA.   You can check out Craigslist for an idea of the listings and rents in Brickell. There are a number of Miami redditors that are realtors, and I'd definitely recommend hiring one. In FL, the owner pays the commissions to find tenants, so you lose nothing in hiring one."
Miami,30ditr,SurlyDuffBeer,4,Thu Mar 26 15:11:23 2015 UTC,Excellent. Thank you so much for the info! I will definitely look in Brickell. Is Brickell considered downtown?
Miami,30ditr,rimjobz,7,Thu Mar 26 15:14:53 2015 UTC,"Yes and no I guess. ""Downtown"" can either refer to the entire area, or the commercial part of downtown that's north of the river. South of the river all the way to the Key Biscayne bridge is considered Brickell. It's called that because US-1 in that part of Miami is called Brickell Avenue.  Brickell is more residential than commercial, but both north and south of the river have condos and commercial businesses."
Miami,30ditr,Brett4Life,2,Thu Mar 26 15:17:47 2015 UTC,"One thing for you to keep in mind though is that $2300 in Brickell will get you a nice 2/2 or 3/2 apartment. I'm saying this because I don't know how it is in your town in Connecticut but in a lot of other places $2300 will get you a 5/4 house with a 2 car garage and a pool.  With that said I do believe that Brickell is probably the best area for you unless you will be working in the Bird Rd. spot only, then you do have other awesome options."
Miami,30ditr,rimjobz,3,Thu Mar 26 19:08:27 2015 UTC,"Worth mentioning downtown/Brickell is on the water, but not on the beach. Without traffic you can still get to South Beach or Key Biscayne in 10 mins though. I live downtown, can't complain. Very central."
Miami,30ditr,SurlyDuffBeer,2,Thu Mar 26 19:10:44 2015 UTC,"I agree, good point. However Brickell is insane rush hour traffic from 7 AM to 7 PM so that could be annoying too. Either way, it all depends on what you want."
Miami,30ditr,theboss201,2,Thu Mar 26 19:15:00 2015 UTC,You should probably come here before you move to get a feel for the different neighborhoods mentioned here. Never a good idea to sign a rental agreement blindly.

Miami,30ditr,huracan,2,Thu Mar 26 15:50:47 2015 UTC,"Downtown Miami is up and coming, but be ready to deal with tons of construction and incredible traffic congestion.  Brickell is more of the business/legal/financial center of town. Not really much to offer as far as culture.  South Beach is like Disneyworld, but as close to the beach as you can get. Stay South of 5th street if possible.  Edgewater is a nice area with easy access to Downtown, the Beach and I-95. But, the Venetian Causeway is closing soon limiting direct access to Miami Beach."

Miami,30ditr,the_broccoli,4,Thu Mar 26 16:11:16 2015 UTC,"Realistically Aventura is in NMB and I personally wouldnt want to live there because of all the traffic from the mall (Aventura Mall is the highest grossing in the country). Since you have a pretty good budget to work with and you said you want to live on the beach...look at places on or right next to the beach.   Given where your job sites are, I would look in Hollywood and Hallandale Beach as well whcih are in Broward but right up on the county line. Within Miami you can look at sunny isles beach, surfside, bal harbour and into south beach.   Brickell is a cool area too but IMO pricier than its worth. If you like hipper, artsy areas, Midtown near Wynwood is pretty cool and you can likely spend less money than Brickell/the Beach."

Oh, and there is a rapidly growing gap between the wealthy and the shrinking middle class.  On the plus side, the sunrise is amazing over the coast and it'll all be washed away with sea level rise in the next 20 years. So yay!  On a more serious note: it all depends on which part of town you will be working in. Coral Gables, Brickell, Miami Beach, Aventura, all have very nice areas in your budget. But these can be very far from each other."
Miami,30e2ex,P64,-2,Thu Mar 26 17:01:46 2015 UTC,It's a chronic problem in South Florida.  Everywhere in Miami they are closing parking lots and building high rises.   It's part of a conspiracy to keep out us poor people who can't just walk to the beach from our houses.   My favorite was the big project they did in Hollywood Beach to repave and fix up a public parking lot using taxpayer money. Less than a year after spending our money on the remodel they sold the lot and built a hotel.   Classic Miami corruption at work.
Miami,30e2ex,Sterling-Archer,-2,Thu Mar 26 19:20:02 2015 UTC,Do you think Hollywood is far away enough to be free from Miami's influence? Do you think the same scummy investors and developers don't make it up that far?
Miami,30e2ex,Sterling-Archer,1 point,Thu Mar 26 19:31:33 2015 UTC,"Never thought about it like that, but that's a good theory... Do you have any speculation on why private developers haven't tried to make parking lots if all the public ones are being taken and redeveloped?"
Miami,30e2ex,Flymia,1 point,Thu Mar 26 22:23:25 2015 UTC,There is more money in making buildings than parking lots. Long term a parking lot can make a ton of money. Parking lots garages are also supposedly very expensive to make.
Miami,30e2ex,acusticthoughts,1 point,Thu Mar 26 19:48:22 2015 UTC,"So it's not a conspiracy, but instead capitalism?"
Miami,30e2ex,Flymia,1 point,Thu Mar 26 20:15:27 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. I never really put much thought into parking lot operations, but just at a glance I feel like besides having a flat lot, painted lines, fence, security cameras, and an attendant booth; there wouldn't be much to it... I guess property taxes and insurance stuff probably adds a big burden, but still, it seems like it shouldn't be a huge operation."
Miami,30e2ex,aCause4Concern,1 point,Thu Mar 26 22:36:46 2015 UTC,"Well you are talking about a flat pavement lot than yea certainly not much to it. The thing is in hot areas like Downtown Brickell, Miami Beach, Wynwood, Midtown etc.. those empty lots sell for tens of millions of dollars.   If you owned a flat lot that lets say parked 175 cars a day at $10 a day thats a nice $638,750 in revenue. Lets say expenses are $150,000 if that, nice profit. Now Mr. Perez comes knocking on your door and says. Hey I will give you $30,000,000.00 for that parking lot of you own.   What you going to do?"
Miami,30e2ex,Flymia,4,Thu Mar 26 20:19:36 2015 UTC,"What you going to do?   Tell Mr. Perez that we're only going to officially declare half of that sales price to save on taxes, hide the rest offshore, and kick back a hefty amount to him for his cooperation."
Miami,30e2ex,Sterling-Archer,1 point,Thu Mar 26 22:08:57 2015 UTC,Everywhere in Miami they are closing parking lots and building high rises.   That's called progress. The parking lots being closed are empty lots. Empty lots now have buildings on them. This is a good thing.   Public garages in Miami have not been redeveloped. And in Miami Beach they recently just opened a public garage.
Miami,30e2ex,Flymia,2,Fri Mar 27 16:32:52 2015 UTC,A parking lot and an empty lot are two different things. The lot/garage that they closed in Hollywood was completely full every weekend. Even the lots in the less popular North Miami Beach area are completely full this time of year.   What's the point Florida's best asset (the beaches) being public access and a tourist attraction if there is no where to fucking park? Do we really need another condo for foreign money to buy and leave empty 50 weeks of the year?

If you're into clubbing we could've been buddies haha   What I advise you to do is the following:    Go to MeetUp.com and find activities you actually genuinely enjoy. You'll meet cool people who enjoy the same activities (which would make a potential good friend in the long term) Go to nearby bars/lounges if you're into that scene. Even though I was living with an uncle of mine during my vacation none of my freaking 10 cousins that I have in Miami EVER went clubbing with me. I did however went out by myself and tried to socialize and actually made some buddies for the night.  It was lots of fun!    I tried to make friends through CraigsList and I only got perverted e-mails so yeah.. smfh"

There isn't any parking for free anywhere near. If you go to the parking office they will sell you discounted parking if you buy a month's worth...at least they use to. Not sure if they still do this. The metro-rail is safe during daytime hours. Don't hesitate to pm me if you have any questions about Jackson."

Closest station is Civic Center, about a block from your destination. Parking at a metro station lot is $4.50/day, train fare is $2 one-way, so not very cost effective for you on a day-to-day basis.  However -monthly farecards are discounted and unlimited, and parking passes can be added on for $12/month.  And yeah, the train's plenty safe and fairly reliable."

Miami,307yo2,Usethisasmyname,1 point,Wed Mar 25 15:11:48 2015 UTC,Look up where the train goes.  You can park for free a block away from a reasonable metrorail station then walk to the train. It drops you within walking distance. We also used to park in the neighborhood about half a mile away from Jackson and walk/skate. It's hot but free and though it can superficially look sketchy we never had issues with anyone breaking into the cars. LPT: Keep a small umbrella and a thin shirt/pants change in a plastic bag with you or in the car and/or at work.

Miami,307yo2,kroxywuff,1 point,Wed Mar 25 16:14:01 2015 UTC,"Dominion parking garage or the CRB garage of UMH offer discounts if you park before 8 and leave after 5 I think? Parking at a metrorail and taking it in will cost you ~$6/day.   If you live up north like NMB or Aventura or Miami Gardens you can park at the Golden Glades Tri-Rail station and take the train in. Metrorail is $4 for round trip and tri-rail is ~2.20 for a round trip if you buy the 12 trip pass.  Metrorail monthly pass + monthly parking pass is $123.75. That's $6.18/work day which is the same as the tri-rail plan.  You may qualify for a discounted fare on either of these services, which cuts the price down by half sometimes (at least for UM employees)."

Miami,307yo2,kroxywuff,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:16:15 2015 UTC,Here is a map of the routes.  http://www.595expressbus.com/  http://www.broward.org/BCT/Schedules/Pages/default.aspx  Looks like it departs from sunrise park and ride and the davie park and ride. I know the 95e departs from the GGI. Anyway you want the bus to the civic center (aka UMH/JMH).  To get the UMH/JMH by 9:00am you would take the 7:52 bus and get there at 8:44. Could also take the 8:27 and arrive at 9:15.  I don't know how to find the real schedule but I see bascom palmer employees take (and I took for a while) the bus that stops right here.  If it's like the 95e then parking is free.

Miami,307yo2,kroxywuff,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:33:09 2015 UTC,"What's your schedule. I could tell you stuff to take that's better if I knew that.  The morning buss leaves every 15-20 minutes from 5:30 to 8:30 and the bus home is every 20-30 minutes from 3 to 8.  There's a tri-rail parking station at FLL and you could take that to and from + metrorail exchange. That has more times throughout the day (hourly between rush hours?) The actual train trip would be ~30 minutes. Plus you can do whatever while on the train, like nap or read or watch some hulu."
Miami,308zjv,p1v,2,Wed Mar 25 13:23:34 2015 UTC,"Be very careful with them. Basically, the insurance company decided it was a loss and that the cost to fix (after an accident, flood, etc) was more than the value of the car, and so the totalled it.   After that, you can rebuild it and get a rebuilt title, but it's never going to be a clean title (unless you change states and do some shady stuff). We actually have a lot of cars from New York from when Hurricane Sandy destroyed up there. That means if it's a New York car, it's going to have severe water damage.  Just be very careful and always ask WHY it was rebuilt and if they have pictures of it before it was rebuilt. Maybe it was just a rear end collision but you wouldn't know the frame is ruined until you actually inspect the underside of the car."
Miami,308zjv,EchoedSilence,2,Wed Mar 25 15:00:14 2015 UTC,It really depends. Years ago I bought my 04 Civic from a shop that had rebuilt it. It was previously a corporate car that the company was quick to write off. It had 30k miles and had suffered front end damage. It's been almost 10 years and 90k miles later and it's still going well.

Miami,308zjv,bigslick1,1 point,Wed Mar 25 15:56:15 2015 UTC,"Just to echo what other people said, you need to be careful about them. Definitely make sure you have a mechanic look at them, and ask a lot of questions. I bought a car that was a year old w/ 5k miles that was rebuilt. The guy I bought it from had a bunch of them, and had pictures of the cars from when he bought them with the damage, and the car I bought did only had pretty minor damage. They seem to be pretty good quality on average, but varies by mechanic/seller."

I bought to get me around during school, and I don't plan on keeping it once I make enough to get a better car. But if you're looking for cheap wheels for a few years, a rebuilt just might do you fine."
Miami,308zjv,Midas7g,0,Thu Mar 26 22:31:46 2015 UTC,"Rebuilt just means that the car has been assembled out of parts of different functioning cars. It makes it a little difficult to trace the history of the car, which means you might have issues getting insurance coverage depending on what the car has been through.  I personally have not had any issues with rebuilt cars, but you need to know a bit more about cars to be able to spot things like frame damage or water/flood damage.  If you're willing to take a risk, it's not a bad way to get a cheap car. Just be careful and smart."

It's like a cat dog mouse. Very cool creature. Doesn't look anything like the Disney-esque red fox.  And a visit to South Florida isn't complete without spotting a gopher tortoise. If you go to Deerfield Island Park, an actual island in the Intercoastal on the Broward/Palm Beach County border, you're likely to see a few of those.  Recently I saw a hawk, also. Hawks are cool.  I hear a lot of people have seen crocodiles around Greynold's Park in the past few years.

That's a large area I just mentioned but the advantage is that you will be traveling the opposite flow of heavy traffic each day. Also, if you land in the Kendall-Killian-Cutler Bay Area you will be living in a better area.   For your budget though, apartments/townhomes are going to be your better option.  I will leave it to the people in the area described to recommend specific areas and complexes.  Good luck!"

Miami,307r4y,dubgymfuckshit,7,Wed Mar 25 03:35:21 2015 UTC,"As of now, it is something you shouldn't ignore. If you don't pay the fine, a legitimate ticket will be sent to you, which will cost more and potentially put points on your license. If you legitimately made a full stop before turning right on red, then you should request a court date. However, they will have video of the incident. You can view it on the website the ticket directs you to. If you didn't stop before the white line completely before turning, you ran the light and the video will prove it.   Many people are fighting the county governments right to even operate red light cameras, so if you do pay, save your receipts. If the law is overturned, we may all get reimbursed.   As for the Arizona and Ohio locations, those are where the company who operates the system and processes the payments are located. There are a few companies running the red light camera systems for counties all over the country. Big business these days."
Miami,307r4y,live_in_person,1 point,Wed Mar 25 03:49:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you I really appreciate it, that's the info I needed. I'll look at the video. Thanks again."
Miami,307r4y,Flymia,6,Wed Mar 25 04:17:00 2015 UTC,"I would fight it. There is current case law stating the way they give tickets is unconsitutional. I would first call Miami Gardens PD and find out how they issue the tickets. Does a Miami Gardens Police Officer watch every possible violation video Or does a Miami Gardens Police Officer only watch the violations the camera operator tells them to. If it is the ladder your ticket should be thrown out. see here   Even more important is does the intersection you got a red light ticket have a sign saying not only that there is a camera but ALSO ""right turns included."" All intersections with red lights cameras have to have a sign near by telling you there is a camera and if it included right turns it also has to have a sign saying this. If it does not the ticket should be thrown out. If you really did slowly make the right turn, at say 5mph the ticket should also be thrown out IMO. But that is up to the hearing officer.   Don't ignore it though. If you do not pay the fine they will send you an actual moving violation for a larger fine which could have points and insurance issues. Right now you just have a civil infraction, your insurance and driving record will remain clean there is no record of this ticket at the moment.   The two cities in Arizona and Ohio are where the camera operators work out of. Red light tickets are a joke on our state's constitution and the way they operate is a joke on the people of this state. Judges have finally realized this.   If I was you I would fight it. But its up to you if you have the time out of your day to fight it or just pay the money and be gone with it. But it is correct to save your info on this because you might get your money back with the current law suits."
Miami,307r4y,dockmarlin,1 point,Wed Mar 25 13:55:39 2015 UTC,I think I'm leaning towards fighting it because I really don't want to just hand over $150 to the City of Miami Gardens that easily... I'm going to look more into all of this but I really appreciate your input. Thanks for the help.

Miami,307r4y,lmn89,2,Wed Mar 25 13:48:18 2015 UTC,"Pull the red light camera statute. It has language about right hand turns, something like you are ok as long as you reasonably checked and made the turn. Go to your hearing with a copy of that statute, give it to the judge, watch your video, then argue that your turn fits under the statute. The judge might agree and toss the ticket.  I got my wife out of a ticket for the same thing. YMMV."

Miami,3074t0,MoebiusX,1 point,Wed Mar 25 01:47:50 2015 UTC,"Find some roommates. It's not just the money (though that's important), but if you're starting out on your own early it can be helpful if you watch each other's backs."
Miami,3074t0,TunaNugget,1 point,Wed Mar 25 03:04:21 2015 UTC,"use a realtor and let them know specifically what you are looking for. 45 min away from FIU is a big area, so you may want to narrow that down a bit. I assume you are looking to rent, so adding your budget would be helpful, too."
Miami,3074t0,ReallyFatPeopleOnTLC,1 point,Wed Mar 25 03:44:59 2015 UTC,"You're going to need rent x 3 (first, last, security) to get into most places. So if you're renting an $800 bedroom you will need $2,400 up front. If you have a couple of room mates (more likely one, a 3 bedroom can be harder to find) you can reduce that cost. That's already exceeding what you have in savings today. You'll definitely want to pad that savings account as much as possible to account for any potential loss in income you might have while living on your own. 6 months of living expenses (rent, utilities, food, gas, etc) is a good rule of thumb but probably isn't necessary for someone your age in your situation.    When you budget for electricity keep in mind that winter will probably cost half of what summer would. You're going to want to budget for whatever the absolute most you'll pay for electricity in a given month. Sure it'll cost $35 in January but you'll be paying $80-90 in the summer depending on how well-insulated your apartment is."

I'm going to PM you my information. I'm a realtor in Miami."
Miami,30675t,JonathanPaz,2,Tue Mar 24 22:28:37 2015 UTC,"South Miami is probably your best bet. Up and coming with bars, restaurants. If you work in Kendall, glenvar, pinecrest you'd be going against the traffic living in South Miami.   Also a nice area is around Dadeland Mall. Bars and nice restaurants are popping up in that area.   Traffic sucks here. Takes my wife a hour to go from Kendall to coral gables for work every morning. A trip that normally takes 20 min."

Coral Gables has bars, golf courses, parks, and is where the University of Miami is located. Coconut Grove has many bars and is where many under 30s hang out. Wynwood is artsy and has a hipster type vibe. Brickell is very dense, with many things to do in a walkable area, but expensive."

Miami,302l5c,grungebuddy,19,Mon Mar 23 23:30:38 2015 UTC,"It depends where you want to live/visit. Most of Miami-Dade is pretty terrible by transit. If you live in Downtown or Brickell, you can live without a car relatively easily. Metromover and metrorail are a great help in this regard. The best transit to the beach (from the mainland) is a bus or uber.  Regardless, I'd look into car2go as a supplement, and there is definitely Uber and Lyft in the city."
Miami,302l5c,cyber_officer,4,Mon Mar 23 23:47:39 2015 UTC,"This. When you move out of the urban area, it'll get rough to maneuver.  The rail will take you to Kendall by Dadeland mall and Trader Joes. But bottom line if you're trying to make it without a car, downtown and Brickell are the best places to stay. When you have to rely on the buses, you'll get screwed at some point."
Miami,302l5c,goldmouthdawg,3,Tue Mar 24 00:02:37 2015 UTC,"Agree with cyber_officer - also coral gables wasn't mentioned, you can walk around here, and there are cars2go, as well as a nice trolley to take you to Brickell or Merrick park."
Miami,302l5c,sppride,9,Tue Mar 24 13:34:27 2015 UTC,"Doable? Sure. Personally only if you lived in downtown/brickell area. Maybe it would be alright as long as you lived near a metrorail stop like by the University of Miami. But it certainly is not a preferred way of living in Miami unlike if you were to live in say D.C. or NYC.   If you lived in Downtown or Brickell and had zipcar it would be fine, assuming getting to work is easy too.   Zipcar and Uber help too."
Miami,302l5c,Flymia,1 point,Tue Mar 24 00:52:57 2015 UTC,"A thought: much of what you just said happily assumes that the asker has a job and that it is also right in this area. If this is not the case, what you are talking about is actually utterly impossible."
Miami,302l5c,BallsJefferson,2,Tue Mar 24 13:24:26 2015 UTC,"assuming getting to work is easy too.   That is why I said this. And it certainly is not utterly impossible. First off the job would not need to be in Downtown/Brickell. A job at UM, a job in the downtown South Miami area, a job at MIA, a job at Civic Center or near a stop in Hialeah would be fine. Even a job in Miami Beach would be fine as bus service from downtown to Miami Beach is not bad."
Miami,302l5c,Flymia,1 point,Tue Mar 24 13:36:42 2015 UTC,"Anything outside of the absolutely immediate area and there is a massive chance that you will be covered in sweat by the time you get there, courtesy of 85+ temps and massive humidity.

The key would be to live as close to work as possible and rely on a short walk/bike ride, or use the metrorail. It too hot to travel long distances,and it rains a lot. Buses are not reliable enough."

You will be covered in sweat and smell awful everywhere you go, you will be incredibly limited in where you can reach.

The only sprawl-ier places I know of are Los Angeles and maybe Atlanta, Atlanta has better rail so it isn't as bad.  If you live in downtown or the beach and own a bike you can survive.

Miami,302l5c,toga_virilis,1 point,Tue Mar 24 11:46:52 2015 UTC,"It is significantly better than MetroRail by comparison. MetroRail essentially goes one route, two directions. At least Marta branches off into different areas of the city and helps people from some suburbs get into Midtown & Downtown.   The MetroRail is mostly useless unless you get to it with a car (which is prohibitively expensive) or have several hours of free time to hop several buses to get to it.   Not to mention the fact that it's more expensive than the NYC subway despite being laughably inefficient by comparison.  If someone is asking us as Miami residents what it's like to get around, we should be honest because it could be life-altering information for them."
Miami,302l5c,darkpassenger9,1 point,Tue Mar 24 13:50:04 2015 UTC,"I've lived all over miami-dade and have mainly relied on public transportation. If you don't mind being squeezed into the bus/metrorail/metromover and can tolerate the dredges of society, and are patient for late busses, then it shouldn't be a problem. If you live within a few miles of your work, them getting by without a car shouldn't be a problem because as much as I dislike people, the busses aren't all that bad.

Miami,2zys2h,miamimiami,7,Mon Mar 23 01:34:08 2015 UTC,IIRC the charge used to be $0.25 maybe $0.50  I fear that ridership would drop drastically though.
Miami,2zys2h,MrPap,4,Mon Mar 23 02:41:21 2015 UTC,I think so too. The metromover is slow and if I have to pay for it I would take the free trolley buses or just split an uber with friends.
Miami,2zys2h,expresswayvisual,4,Mon Mar 23 13:10:21 2015 UTC,"I believe they scrapped this idea once they found out the cost of collecting it is almost as much as what they expected the revenue to be. They have to spend anywhere from $2.4 to $9 million installing a fare-collection system and another $450,000 annually to maintain it. Meanwhile, revenue generated from 50 cent fares is expected to bring $600,000 a year."
Miami,2zys2h,ReallyFatPeopleOnTLC,3,Mon Mar 23 15:49:29 2015 UTC,"Does not look like its going to happen as /u/ReallyFatPeopleOnTLC the board came to their senses a bit and realized the cost to collect the fare, and then keep collecting outweighs the benefit of keeping it free. It would take years to make the money back if not over a decade. It makes no sense, not enough people ride it and with a fee, even just 50 cents less would ride it."
Miami,2zys2h,Flymia,2,Mon Mar 23 16:15:32 2015 UTC,"Probably unpopular opinion, but a $1 fare is still a good deal--and the revenue could be earmarked for improvements and expansion for all. Right now the ridership is tourists and homeless people."

Miami,2zys2h,dauphinator,0,Mon Mar 23 21:54:14 2015 UTC,"I'm curious as to how you came to the conclusion that someone without a home has less of a right to ride a public transport than someone who has a home?  Fuck'em right? They aren't even human. I'm inconvenienced by someone that doesn't have a home on this shared public transit vehicle. So what if they are trying to get all the way from Brickell to Omni, let em walk. Because they don't have a home they don't deserve to breathe the same air as I do."
Miami,2zys2h,zewm426,6,Mon Mar 23 16:33:35 2015 UTC,"To be fair, zewm426, I'd like to believe rollcoal is referring to the fact that in the summertime, there are a lot that sleep on the Metromover because of air conditioning, and kind of abuse it more so than actually using it to get from Brickell to Omni."
Miami,2zys2h,cag115,2,Mon Mar 23 18:51:27 2015 UTC,"Correct. If you ride the MM in the summer, this is a legitimate complaint. It's not a shelter, it's a transit system for people who live and work downtown and pay taxes. We also pay taxes to help these people get Section 8 and other forms of public assistance."
Miami,2zys2h,dauphinator,-1,Mon Mar 23 21:55:54 2015 UTC,"Yea, it's much better to let them get heat exhaustion and dehydration from the heat+humidity. Who cares right, it's not like they are a living human being.  That's a pretty weak excuse. They already have a difficult time and they seek shelter in a public area to get by another day, but it's an inconvenience to people with that look down on them as if they were a heap of trash taking up space.  Fuck them. Darwin's theory of evolution. Survival of the fittest. Let nature sort them out."
Miami,2zys2h,zewm426,4,Mon Mar 23 19:01:47 2015 UTC,"Spoken like someone who's never had to ride the MM with one of these stink machines. Better to fix the issue--get them off the streets and into shelters, rather than ruining an otherwise great public service."
Miami,2zys2h,dauphinator,0,Mon Mar 23 21:54:06 2015 UTC,"Nice try chief. I had my license revoked for a year and I had to ride the metrorail and mover to get to work 5 days a week for an entire year. I have indeed ridden along side these urban explorers.  Your statement is an example of your view. You don't even refer to them as human but rather as 'stink machines'. Additionally, regardless of homeless people using the public service, it's not ""otherwise great"". The homeless issue aside, the public transit system in this city has bigger problems than it's passengers.  That being said, I agree with you that it would be more effective to fix the problem and get them off the street. However, that doesn't mean we should treat them like shit. It would be unfortunate if you became stricken with such circumstances as some of these people. Not all of them live this way by choice. Some of them have no other means or are living through a rough patch in their lives.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUBTAdI7zuY  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Lki_IeM6bQ  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Rsc-2oMB0s  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCZ1YteCv5M"
Miami,2zys2h,zewm426,3,Mon Mar 23 22:38:41 2015 UTC,"Sorry, friend, I don't commute here, unlike you, I live among them. So I would be perfectly fine with them not riding the MM all day everyday just because it's more comfortable than a shelter. And yes, they smell like shit. Doesn't mean they should be treated that way, just means we are allowed to speak some truth. Your heart is in the right place, but it does more harm than good for them and all of us. Maybe you should donate or volunteer instead of suggesting that people WHO LIVE HERE (unlike you) and who pay the property taxes that keep this system running (unlike you) should somehow overlook the fact that they ABUSE this perk of the city and make it unpleasant for all?"
Miami,2zys2h,dauphinator,1 point,Tue Mar 24 00:27:49 2015 UTC,Fair enough. There is nothing more I can add to this conversation. It looks like a strand of DNA. You have your views and I have mine. We'll have to agree to disagree otherwise it's going to just be an endless run on conversation with no finality in sight.
Miami,2zys2h,zewm426,2,Tue Mar 24 00:49:26 2015 UTC,We have some common ground. I think we both agree these people need help.
Miami,2zys2h,dauphinator,-1,Tue Mar 24 00:51:50 2015 UTC,They smell and spend the entire day taking up room for free air conditioning. They don't have a legitimate purpose on the mover so they don't belong there.
Miami,2zys2h,rollcoal,0,Tue Mar 24 03:06:36 2015 UTC,Because you deserve the free air conditioning more so than they do? How do you figure?
Miami,2zys2h,zewm426,-1,Tue Mar 24 03:24:40 2015 UTC,Eat a dick you liberal idiot. No body should be riding the metro mover endlessly without a destination solely as a place to sleep.

Miami,2zuhrs,redditizio,10,Sat Mar 21 22:09:18 2015 UTC,"As someone in the auto insurance industry, this is just the tip of the iceberg. On a daily basis I have to deal with this kind of shit. This is how it works: you get into an accident, random tow truck shows up (likely called by a police officer or public service aide), and in your moment of chaos and helplessness they ask you to sign papers authorizing them to remove your car from the scene and take it to a shop or tow yard. In these papers you are agreeing to storage charges, and all kinds of bullshit fees that will set you back hundreds of dollars.   If you have collision coverage, your insurance will pay to remove the car.  If you don't, you are fucked either paying the charges out of pocket or waiting til the other persons insurance concludes everything (1. if they have insurance, 2. Even if they have insurance it's probably some bullshit carrier like united auto that will take months to conclude the process or deny the claim).   These places make a killing feeding off people in need.  Scum of the earth for sure. If you ever get in an accident remember that you can refuse whatever tow truck shows up on the scene and call your own, or demand that your car is taken to your home or a relatives home.  Don't sign any papers without reading them and if your car is taken to one of these places get it out of there ASAP.   Tl;dr: tow trucks and police officers have an incestuous relationship in our city that take advantage of helpless people with no shame. Never authorize a tow truck you didn't call to take your car to a shop of their choice and always read anything before signing it."
Miami,2zuhrs,001503,8,Sun Mar 22 03:30:02 2015 UTC,"This may seem like a naive question, but why doesn't anybody ever do anything about this?  I know people are getting paid off left and right, and Miami is probably the most corrupt city in the US, but it still surprises me that no one has ever done anything about it, ever.  Although there are many examples, two other things that are happening remind of the utter corruption of this city:   In the Brickell area, construction crews work 24 hours a day on the plethora of construction projects going on.  As I type this, it's 12:30 in the night and there are approximately 20 concrete trucks outside my window pouring concrete and driving around in reverse (beep-beep-beep) while some foreman directs them all by blowing a whistle every 2 seconds.  I can just imagine all the payoffs that happened to allow this and I can't do anything about it.  How can there not be any noise regulations and if there are have blatant corruption out in the open that allows these people to pay off city employees and do whatever they want with no regard to anyone? I just read that out of the top 20 highest paid public employees something like 12 of them are Miami Beach cops (not detectives - regular patrol cops), who scam the system and use tax payer assets to work outside clubs and restaurants for something like $76 hour.  Most of them make 180k-200k per year.  No one ever does anything about this.   There are hundreds of other examples of course.  It's beyond my capacity to understand."
Miami,2zuhrs,Flymia,3,Sun Mar 22 04:41:25 2015 UTC,"While it is nuts how much some cops make in some cities and some County cops make a ton too the guys working extra at clubs and resturants are paid by the clubs and resturants not by the city. So if they want to pay them $76 an hour so be it its their money not tax payers money. Some of that money goes to the city too.   Cops for larger cities and counties deserve to have a career that gives them the opportunity to make $100k after some years of seniority it's a dangerous and difficult job, but I agree there are ton of overpaid city and country employees out there, from cops to firefighters and mangers or even the politicians themselves.   As for the construction, I'm not really sure but they do need to get permits and whatnot to get 24hr construction. 24hr construction goes on all over the country and world."
Miami,2zuhrs,Flymia,1 point,Sun Mar 22 14:28:42 2015 UTC,"Although I agree with the spirit of allowing cops to do something to increase their earnings, I disagree with the execution.  Firstly, they use their taxpayer financed job tools (car, uniform, gun, etc) and the taxpayer gets nothing (as usual).  Secondly, this drives bad behavior - if an officer knows he can make more money sitting outside of LIV talking to the chicks trying to get in rather than doing his real job, he's going to be sure to work as few hours as possible on his real job and as many as possible on his high paying kushy job (which is why 12 of the 20 highest paid city officials are patrol cops).  Thirdly, all I ever see them doing is hanging out and shooting the shit with passerbys, mostly women. (nothing wrong with this, I just don't want to pay for it).  And finally, I don't think a patrol cop should make $200k/year, full stop.  I understand it's a difficult and dangerous job, but that's too much.  Why should they make more than a homicide detective or an FHP officer?  For the noise ordinance stuff I hear you (pun intended), however as far as I know (and I could be wrong) Miami is the only place where a city employee has sole discretion and the power to decide whether or not to permit 24-hr work permits.  If that doesn't foster a corrupt scenario in an already rotten-to-the-core city, I don't know what does."
Miami,2zuhrs,MiamiPower,3,Sun Mar 22 15:51:41 2015 UTC,I agree with most of what you said. ESPECIALLY the point about detectives and FHP State employees are very underpaid. What's even more messed up State Attorneys the ones responsible of putting people into jail starting pay is less than a first year cop.   But the officers all have to work a certain amount of hours: you right that these type of jobs would make them less likely to work on duty overtime. I also agree I don't see a reason any officer should make $200k especially with the pension and benefits they get after. And take home cars. I understand the reason for it and the benefits but that is something that abusived all the time.

Most will accommodate additional vehicles if they can, however, this typically involves a fee.   If you don't need any spaces, you can occasionally negotiate a price reduction. This is not always the case.  Parking fees can range from ~$25 / month to north of $150, depending on the building and where the actual parking is located. Third party lots/garages are usually more expensive, and might be a short walk (Midtown for example)."

It's a subjective answer, but for me I think that if you live downtown, you're more likely to be into trying out the newest restaurant or bar.  If you're from an older, affluent neighborhood they would most be interested maybe in something relaxing like playing golf or something.  Maybe what I'm asking is what's the most hipster?  Maybe.  I just want to be close to a place where people are at least thinking about what bands/dj's/acts are in town."
Miami,2zpruw,clo3o5,2,Fri Mar 20 19:55:12 2015 UTC,"Ah! that is a much better way of putting it.   Def Wynwood then. Theres a lot going on there, some smaller clubs lounges where you'll hear mainly undeground DJs playing tech and deep house, bunch of bars that sometimes have live music as well. But most of the time to see a more famous DJ (even if hes still underground and not mainstream) you'd have to hit up a club on the beach or maybe club space in downtown.  For big bands, concerts are usually at the AAA or Fillmore Theater at the beach.    So the areas you're looking for are Wynwoond, Downtown/Brickell, South Beach.   Resident advisor is great for events with DJs: http://www.residentadvisor.net/events.aspx  besides that, follow the Miami New Times on facebook or twitter and they usually have writeups about everything going on in the city on a weekly basis.

I used to work for fail your entertainment (which had a heavy focus on used products). I can tell you that the customer ALWAYS gets the shaft. The company will give you a fraction of the value for it and resell it near MSRP. It should really only be a last resort or for lazy people that don't mind having a losing deal. This same thing applies to pawn shops, gamestop, etc.  Just sell the games yourself on craigslist, the flea market or word of mouth. You'll have a greater return on investment."

I remember that we spent a long while killing roach after roach after roach easily like one every minute on the first day. After about a week they were much less frequent but we each still killed like 8 in one day so like 30 roaches a day. It took maybe 2 months before we stopped having roaches daily and once in a while would still find some  I haven't seen those fuckers for about 6 years now so I think we did a good job of fixing the problem. Other than killing the roaches, we also put raid all along the edges of the wall where it meets the floor and on any edges around a door. Another good idea we had was to pull out the fridge and oven and seal any holes in  the wall with some of that white cement paste you can get at home depot.  So if you do run into a roach problem, just know that if you put a little bit of work to it you can clear an infestation without professionals."

Miami,2zhagp,rico1x1,1 point,Wed Mar 18 16:12:19 2015 UTC,"A great topic we recorded with terrible audio (sorry about that). If you're interested take a listen to the episode, on our website biscaynetales.com or from iTunes (or any other podcast directory).  Here's a brief summary:  In February 1926, Miami hosted the fastest drivers in the world at a novel racetrack in Fulford-By-The-Sea, a new development in what is now North Miami Beach. Spectators packed the hastily constructed and heavily promoted Fulford-Miami Speedway, billed as the ‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs Fastest Track‚Äù, to see cars race at more than 130 MPH over rickety wooden boards. The ‚Äúannual‚Äù event was the brainchild of Carl Fisher, a driving force behind the Indianapolis 500 remembered locally for his role in developing Miami Beach and (of course) Fisher Island. Few would now list Fulford-By-The-Sea or its racetrack among his many achievements.  The development, the track, and the race were products of an impossibly optimistic Miami then experiencing an unprecedented land boom. Despite the hype, neither the event nor the boom were to last long. The first race for the Carl G. Fisher Trophy would also be the last. In this episode, we discuss what transpired that day and in the months to follow."

Additionally, even though she claims not to have a handbook or anything like that, she most likely has been educated on these policies or instructed to read some material like every other job requires.

Miami,2zejpe,wetteraffe,2,Wed Mar 18 01:17:45 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't know, but I can't imagine it being much more than 10-20K pesos to almost any beach in Cartagena. Taxi service in Colombia is very inexpensive."

Miami,2zejpe,9muses,2,Wed Mar 18 05:18:23 2015 UTC,Must go to the castle! And I would honestly set aside a day just to roam the old city of Cartagena -- getting lost in the city is the best thing that happened to me when I went.

You had to pay to take a little boat there if I remember correctly. There weren't a lot of people too. The public beaches are kind of ugly and crowded imo."
