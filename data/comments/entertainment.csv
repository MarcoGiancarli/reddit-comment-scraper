entertainment,3e251e,andythepirate,9,Tue Jul 21 13:01:10 2015 UTC,I think one of the things that made the originals great was casting relatively unknown actors.

entertainment,3e251e,SyrioForel,2,Tue Jul 21 16:59:37 2015 UTC,"The problem comes if they have some sort of baggage, like being type cast.

entertainment,3dt2t1,spelkey,32,Sun Jul 19 04:40:53 2015 UTC,Immediately thought of the first season of The Walking Dead where Rick and crew go after a gang only to find the potential baddies supporting nursing home residents who were abandoned at the beginning of the outbreak.

entertainment,3dt1h5,confluencer,-9,Sun Jul 19 11:15:29 2015 UTC,"And yet his wife still stays silent. To me, that is the biggest disgrace of this situation. I realize divorcing, for her, is a very complicated situation in and of itself, but why don't the wives of these men stand up and publicly hold them accountable? How can she stay married to him with all of these allegations adding up? Again, I realize her experience with him may not have been anything similar to what the accusers have said about him. But at some point, the wife, I would think, would realize she is one of the biggest victims of his abuses and deserves to be separated from his messy legacy. If his wife would just stand up now publicly and say she won't support him anymore, I'm sure spouses around the world would cheer on her behalf."

entertainment,3dt1h5,Krazyflipz,-22,Sun Jul 19 18:42:37 2015 UTC,"I'd be more surprised if an entertainer didn't do this. I certainly don't think it's good or moral behavior, but this is why I don't trust any celebrity whose claim to fame is entertainment to inform me about what's right and wrong. They're ALL part of the problem of their own creation. Let's face it: Billy probably had to take a few casting couches himself. He's 78; Gloria Allred's involved; he says Benedryl for one particular case (his word against hers), and says ludes were available then for partying purposes (uh, duh). Hell, I see college friends doing this same shit all the damned time, knowingly (both parties), and that's their business... but I'm not turning to them for help on any moral dilemma, either.  Mostly though: Gloria Allred.  I wish Allred would go after the entertainers who are rumored to be using child labor for cheap, or whatever Gossip Cop is alluding to this week. I'd have a helluva lot more respect for the woman if she seemed more honest like that, and didn't stand to make a killing in hush money (I mean, ""NDA agreements to settle out-of-court."") That woman makes me ILL."

entertainment,3dt1h5,sedgwickian,8,Sun Jul 19 12:51:37 2015 UTC,"Gloria Allred didn't invent 50 women telling the same story. Gloria Allred didn't force Bill Cosby to admit under oath that he drugged women for sex.  And no, all celebrities are not serial rapists. That's not normal. Your sympathies are all fucked up."
entertainment,3dt1h5,brojangles,-9,Sun Jul 19 16:26:48 2015 UTC,"Who cares?  He did what most men would do (have done), if they had his same money, connections, and influence.  It's a witch hunt."
