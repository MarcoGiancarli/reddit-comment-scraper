A crucial detail you've missed here is that the prisoners are told (or see) how many hats of each color there are in the first place. (Spoiler tagged just in case)  The answer is the middle guy on the group side of the wall knows his hat must be different than the person in front of him (ie. blue) after a brief delay, because if he had been wearing the same color as the person in front, the person in the back would have immediately known his own hat color (since there are only two white) and said something.

riddles,3ctqvn,allstar64,6,Fri Jul 10 18:29:01 2015 UTC,"Weigh four of the coins against four different ones.  If they are equal, weigh three of the remaining coins against three of the ones you know are real. Assume that the new three are heavier (the same logic works if they are lighter).  Weigh two of the heavier ones against each other, and the heavier one there is the counterfeit.  If they are the same, the third coin is the counterfeit.  Now, let us assume that the coins in the original measure were uneven.  To assist in visualizing, let's paint the four coins that were on the lighter side blue and the four coins that were on the heavier side green. Place two green coins and one blue coin on each side.  If they are even, weigh the two remaining blue coins against each other.  The lighter coin is the counterfeit. If they are uneven, we are left with three possibilities for the counterfeit coin--the two green coins from the heavier side of the second weighing and the one blue coin from the lighter side of the second weighing. Weigh the two green coins from the heavier side against each other.  The heavier one is the counterfeit.  If they are equal, the blue coin from the lighter side is counterfeit."
riddles,3ctqvn,crispy_llama,2,Fri Jul 10 22:17:12 2015 UTC,"Nicely explained and good response. Yes, you are correct. The key to this riddle is realizing that after the first weigh of 4 and 4 you are in fact basically re-creating the 8 coin riddle (assuming unbalanced first weight. Balanced first weight is easy to figure out).   The 8 coin riddle relies on splitting the coins into 3 groups and eliminating 2 of the groups with the first weigh. However the 8 coin riddle is actually unsolvable if you aren't told whether the fake coin is heavier or lighter as you might end up with 6 potential coins after the first weigh.  Fortunately in the 12 coin riddle when we narrow it down to 8 coins we can use the knowledge gained from the first weigh to again split the coins into 3 groups and definitively eliminate 2 of them with the second weigh. The rest solves itself."

riddles,3ctqvn,cookie4059,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:24:12 2015 UTC,Sure... well it's a little late now but hiding behind spoilers always helps. It's a pretty common problem (though not as well known as the 8 coin one) So I suspected many people knew it already.
riddles,3ctqvn,TheCopyPasteLife,2,Sat Jul 11 17:58:05 2015 UTC,"Split the coins into groups of 4 - 4 - 4. As seen below (A,B,C) = unknown real/fake. Groups (R) = Real. {4(A)} {4(B)} {4(C)}  Compare 2 of the 3 groups of 4. Lets say (A) and (B). If both are equal then we know those 8 are real. Leaving us with: {8(R)} {4(C)}  Now Split group C into two groups of 2 and compare one of those groups with 2 real coins. If they are the equal then we are left with 2 coins. Compare one of them with a real coin, if they are equal, then the other is fake and vise versa. Also if the compared group from group C wasn't equal the same method can be used to determine the fake coin.  If group (A) and group (B) were unbalanced, then we know group C contains all real coins. Giving us: {4(A)} {4(B)} {4(R)}  Keeping track of which group was heavier/lighter, lets say group A is heavier and group B is lighter. {4(A) Heavier} {4(B) Lighter} We now split one of the two remaining groups into 2 groups of 2 (lets say groups A) and add one coin from the other group to each of the groups in the previous group. So the grouping would look like this: {2(A) - 1(B)} {2(A) - 1(B)} {2(B)} {2(R)}  Now compare two groups {2(A) - 1(B)} {(2(A) - 1(B)}. If they are equal then the fake coin is in {2(B)}. To find the fake one compare one of the coins with a real one.  If {2(A) - 1(B)} {2(A) - 1(B)} are unequal and the heavier/lighter side didn't change meaning {2(A) - 1(B) Heavier} {2(A) - 1(B) Lighter}. Then we know the fake coin is either {2(A) Heavier} or {1(B) Lighter} and if they are unequal but the sides change then it would be the opposite.  Now compare the set of 2(A) with each other. If both are equal then 1(B) is the fake. if they aren't the heavier side is fake."

If the fake is in the 4 coins, it is even easier. Now for both, you are left with two coins, of which only one is fake. Take a random coin and measure it with a coin that is certainly real. If it weighs the same, then the fake is the other coin. If not, then regardless of if the fake is heavier or lighter, you've found the fake coin."

riddles,3ciiez,SolomonKull,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:21:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure this one has an answer. Searching around, there are many riddles that are like this one, even down to having the exact same 4 clues. However those riddles usually involve the set of letters ""t_a_s"" or ""_t_a_s"" where the answer is ""straus"" or ""strauss"" which apparently in German means something along the lines of ""bouquet"" as well as ""ostrich"" which apparently has symbolic meanings connected to bravery and strength. It also apparently has some correlation to ""fighting"" or ""assault"".  This is all just what I've found from searching, and I can't verify it very much. But if you try searching for the 4 clues, you'll probably find the same thing.   I think perhaps the riddle you heard was mixed up with another, or lost in translation."

riddles,3c8zii,som3thing,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:44:20 2015 UTC,"Lagrange polynomial:       In numerical analysis, Lagrange polynomials are used for polynomial interpolation. For a given set of distinct points  and numbers , the Lagrange polynomial is the polynomial of the least degree that at each point  assumes the corresponding value  (i.e. the functions coincide at each point). The interpolating polynomial of the least degree is unique, however, and it is therefore more appropriate to speak of ""the Lagrange form"" of that unique polynomial rather than ""the Lagrange interpolation polynomial"", since the same polynomial can be arrived at through multiple methods. Although named after Joseph Louis Lagrange, who published it in 1795, it was first discovered in 1779 by Edward Waring and it is also an easy consequence of a formula published in 1783 by Leonhard Euler.     Image i - This image shows, for four points ((−9, 5), (−4, 2), (−1, −2), (7, 9)), the (cubic) interpolation polynomial L(x) (in black), which is the sum of the scaled basis polynomials y0ℓ0(x), y1ℓ1(x), y2ℓ2(x) and y3ℓ3(x). The interpolation polynomial passes through all four control points, and each scaled basis polynomial passes through its respective control point and is 0 where x corresponds to the other three control points.

riddles,3c78je,Hetricon,2,Mon Jul 6 16:48:57 2015 UTC,"Agreed that the entire principle of the riddle is wrong. It makes too many flawed leaps of logic  Like, as you say, hours in a day. There are 12 odd and 12 even, not 6 each.  Weeks is, I think, the only one they get right. If you follow their logic, they look at a denomination, and the one below. So Weeks should only consider days, and there are 4 'odd' days  Months is also incorrect. Months very rarely have 4 weeks in them - and they never do for the entire planet (Some places start weeks on Mon, others on Sun), most pass 5 or 6 weeks. '3' would hence be a more accurate answer.  And their logic on Years is all kinds of no. 12 Months in a Year should result in 6 odd values. Instead, they think we ought to say '1''2', and see that in '12' there is only 1 odd value.  So yeah. Bad riddle imo."

riddles,3c0twg,FLAMMAN,3,Fri Jul 3 18:59:48 2015 UTC,"I'll call the thieves A B and C. A is front. C is back. C doesn't see 2 black hats, otherwise he'd know his hat is white. if B sees a black hat AND C doesn't solve the game first, he knows his hat NOT black. Thus would solve the game. Therefore B sees a white hat. Due to this logic, A says his hat is white. The king reveals the hat colors. C white, A and B black. He says ""A, although you were incorrect, your logic is excellent. You are my new counselor. B you weren't right, but you weren't wrong. You go free. C, you are a moron. I forgive your crime of stealing, but you're going to jail for being so dumb.""

(2): B SHOULD realize that (1) means that his hat is white, but he doesn't. He might be stupid, but he stays silent trusting that someone else knows the answer.  (3): A realizes that the silence means that his own hat must be white.  Your version is also correct, but I prefer to believe that none of them is THAT stupid.

riddles,3c0twg,Erlazio,2,Sat Jul 4 03:15:57 2015 UTC,"First off, when this puzzle is given with logicians in place of the thieves, it's no trouble getting the frontmost white hat to say ""white"" for the reasons  given in other replies.   In light of the King's unusual response, I presume that is not what happened here.  Possible alternate explanation:  Assigned hats are black, white, black. Back guy knows nothing and properly says nothing. Middle guy sees only black and so knows he has a white hat. But says nothing because he hates the front guy and wants to trick him into convicting himself even though he'll suffer the same punishment. Front guy, hearing nothing from behing him, but expecting perfidy from the middle guy, shocks everyone by guessing black. He explains his reasoning and middle guy confesses. All three are cleared of theft as promised, but middle guy is in jail as his silence is considered attempted murder of the other two, and the front guy is employed in the King's court for his exceptional judgement of character and quick-thinking ability to avoid nefarious plots against him."

riddles,3bs8z4,Grey-Ferret,3,Wed Jul 1 19:28:26 2015 UTC,This is a math problem. How far away do they start out? Is it scooter-bee-scooter or some other starting scenario? Are they in a single linear direction or can the bee veer left and take off forever?
riddles,3bs8z4,bearsrawr,2,Wed Jul 1 19:13:09 2015 UTC,I don't think so. Assume the collides with the scooter when they meet the first time. The bee will never collide with it again since they're moving the same speed in same direction.
riddles,3bs8z4,Longsocksandsexalots,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:26:08 2015 UTC,"You're right. The bee would turn around and when he hits the other scooter, it would also simultaneously be a scooter collision."

riddles,3bs8z4,Lanhorn9,2,Wed Jul 1 19:16:40 2015 UTC,"The bee is moving at the same speed as the scooter.  It will change direction only once before the scooters collide  Unless of course it changes direction out in front of the scooter, in which case I don't even know how many times it would change direction in the last instance before the scooters hit"
riddles,3bs8z4,GetHisWallet,2,Wed Jul 1 19:32:44 2015 UTC,"It seems to me that the scooters would never collide. They are moving in the same direction (relative to each other). The riddle states that ""2 scooters and a bee are moving from opposite directions."" The word 'opposite' by definition, 'having a position on the other or further side of something; facing something, especially something of the same type.' So if the scooters and the bee are opposite, the scooters must be coming from the same direction, the one opposite from the one the bee is coming from. You can't have more than one 'opposite'. If it said they were coming from 'different' directions, then it would be possible for the scooters to collide. Does that make sense to anyone but me?"
riddles,3bs8z4,chrisimac,2,Wed Jul 1 22:19:50 2015 UTC,"Assuming the bee starts from the same location as a scooter it won't meet with either scooter before they colide since bees can't fly at 100km/h.   Of course if the street is wide enough there is no reason for the scooters to collide at all as they pass eachother as the riders would naturally steer to avoid an accident.  This seems like a riddle that was retold incorrectly.  I bet in the original version the bee was given a speed of like 200km/h, the distance between the scooters was specified, and the question asked how far did the bee travel."
riddles,3bs8z4,AsterJ,3,Wed Jul 1 19:33:38 2015 UTC,"I think you are right that this is a garbled up version of another riddle.  In fact, the form of the riddle as you suggest it is heard being posed to John Nash's students in the movie A Beautiful Mind."
riddles,3bs8z4,papayatree2,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:00:32 2015 UTC,Well I pretty sure you would need to know the distance the scooters are separated and the initial position of the bee.
riddles,3bs8z4,Hunterlanier03,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:14:09 2015 UTC,"1) You can't include the bee in the opposite directions. Now it sounds like 2 scooters from the same direction are moving towards a bee from the opposite direction.  2) The speed of the bee is not clear.  3) Bees can't travel faster than scooters making the premise flawed.  4) There is no reason to believe the scooters would collide making the answer open ended.  5) Ask your friend ""What is badly worded, unclear and comes with a flawed premise?""

riddles,3bihbe,Elektrophorus,12,Mon Jun 29 16:26:46 2015 UTC,A semicolon would be sufficient to separate the independent clauses.
riddles,3bihbe,hamsammicher,-2,Mon Jun 29 20:18:03 2015 UTC,"The fact that this is a debate, shows that perhaps we need to work a little on our language. Sure we could work more on teaching grammar but when so many have trouble in some areas, like the rules of the semicolons, it might be time to revisit the idea and see if we can come up with more intuitive ideas. And put some hats on our vowels, that's just handy.  lol people good at grammar always downvote this stuff. Like it or not our language is more mistake prone due to not having hats for our vowels. Imagine this, archeological dig in the future, and they find this big device, some people think it's some kind of mechanism like a clock, others think it's a horrible torture device. They dig out more and find a small plaque and all the writing is worn off but one word- wound. With the information at hand, is it a clock? or a torture device? hats would help."

One could use a comma, but a semicolon does such a great job of separating independent clauses that don't quite need to be their own sentences.  It is a question of style, not legibility.  I could be wrong about any of that, I wasn't an English major, but I am a legal writer."

riddles,3bihbe,deadleg22,0,Tue Jun 30 19:56:25 2015 UTC,"Alright, let's talk about this.  That is precisely where I meant a comma would be inappropriate.   There are three mistakes in this sentence, what are they?   is NOT proper English. That is a classic sentence splice, as the parts before and after the comma are independent sentences. That is irrevocably wrong. Like, so wrong.  edit Also, how the hell did you interpret that I meant ""the entire sentence"" if I said that a semicolon was an option? You can never end a sentence in a semicolon.    It needs to be   With a semicolon: There are three mistakes in this sentence; what are they?   or   With a period: There are three mistakes in this sentence. What are they?     The only vernacular sentence splices that are acceptable are if you follow a sentence with an affirmative question, such as   There are three mistakes in this sentence, aren't there?"

That is, they put equal weights of importance to the set of objectives that the other holds important in his mind. A wants what B wants.  If there exists any thing at all that means something to you and means nothing to me, then that means I don't have standard empathy to you, that I don't identify with your emotions of what you hold meaningful.

riddles,3bdnqf,NicholasVillars,9,Sun Jun 28 05:57:04 2015 UTC,"I've got a few possibilities thought up.  The items are balloons, and all the person holds is the strings.  Same concept as above, but yo-yos. Remember when yo-yos were a huge thing? When are those going to make a comeback?  The items are sticks of Fruit Stripes gum. Over 120 sticks? Yeah, that's like five minutes of gum. Five minutes of orgasmically intense fruit flavor. Holy shit I need to buy a fuck-ton of Fruit Stripes. That sounds amazing.  The person is Ron Weasley (hence the abject poverty) and he uses magic. Come to think of it, how is that family poor? I mean, muggle money still buys nice houses. I feel like there would be relatively simple ways to exploit magic for profit in those circumstances.  The person is a veritable god of juggling.  The items are tabs of acid still in a sheet. No wonder this family doesn't have any money!  The person has an obsession with latex gloves. Serious OCD going on there. He has to put on exactly 128 pairs of extra thin latex gloves before walking anywhere.   By 'two hands' the author means two servants (as in, farm hands, hired hands, etc.) They are both wizard jugglers with OCD. Their names are Albert and Gerard. Don't make fun of them. Albert has a good sense of humor about it, but Gerard is quite sensitive, you know.  The human rectum is almost nightmarishly elastic. Before you get on to me about the 'using their hands' thing...they're using them. Oh lordy, they're using 'em."
riddles,3bdnqf,Overthinks_Questions,8,Sun Jun 28 08:44:35 2015 UTC,The answer is: all of the above.  Ron Weasley's servants are yo-yo-ing 120 balloons of acid up his arse while he juggles fruit stripes. It's ok - they are all wearing gloves.

riddles,3b5esf,kcMasterpiece,5,Fri Jun 26 05:11:38 2015 UTC,"Maybe start a fire, wait for it to burn out, and then follow the fire as it goes out. This will both make a fireline so the one behind you doesn't catch up, and if it burns out fast enough you could even keep up a relatively fast clip as the one you start will spread at 100mph as well."
riddles,3b5esf,kcMasterpiece,4,Fri Jun 26 03:32:22 2015 UTC,That's actually a method used by smoke jumpers if they can't get clear of the blaze. It's called an escape fire.  It works best if you can run downhill from the pursuing fire and start the escape fire at the base of a valley. Fire travels more quickly uphill and more slowly downhill. It allows your escape fire to burn more quickly and maximizes your time until the main fire reaches you.

Before he can remove their blindfolds, one of the candidates says that she knows the color of her hat. She's right, but how did she know and what color did she guess?

riddles,3affsc,axel_val,15,Sat Jun 20 04:28:30 2015 UTC,"The man was a multimillionaire.  As such, he was targeted for a ransom kidnapping operation.  They took his wife and daughter and demanded half of his total assets to get them back.  Being a stingy miser sort, he refused and assumed they were bluffing.  They mailed him a piece of his wife's finger and a small slice of his daughter's ear.  Wracked with guilt, he agreed to pay.  However, after they received the money, they told him he could only have one of them back.  This was a punishment for initially refusing their demands.  He had to choose which of the women in his life would live, and which would die.  He knew if he refused, they'd kill them both.  His instructions were clear.  He had to go to a particular restaurant that served albatross soup (they felt the symbolism there would be poetic).  Someone would be watching him through the window.  If he pushes the soup away, his wife lives.  If he eats the soup, his daughter lives.  The man twisted and contorted every detail in his mind.  His wife had helped build his fortune.  She had supported him.  He loved her above any other woman he had ever loved.  She was his first everything.  Life wasn't bearable without her.  He clearly could not choose her.  However, this was his daughter!  His breath and blood.  She was a whole new kind of love.  The kind of love where you'd dedicate yourself to their safety and happiness.  A love he could never know with his wife, because she represented a whole new world, one full of promise.  He clearly could not choose her, either.  But he knew he had to choose, and the soup was now in front of him.  In the end, he decided he loved them both very much, but he couldn't have them both die due to his inaction.  He ate the soup, because at least his wife could say she had a good life already while his daughter had yet to really live at all.  Still though, he could not handle knowing that he just sentenced his wife to death, and... like I said before... he just doesn't know life without her."

I know that the numbers add up if you think about it this way:  The manager has $25. The waitress brought $3 back to the men, making the total $28, then the waitress pocketed $2, so that's $30.  Again, if the men paid $27 total, and the waitress pocketed $2, that still leaves the manager with $25, which is correct.   So that's it! The error occurs when you add the $2 instead of subtracting it. That last dollar is divided evenly amongst the three men, but it never entered the pool when you assume they only paid a total of $27.  Boy, I was able to figure that all out just typing it out here. Nice one, OP."

Thus continuing the question. If the answer is ""yes"" then it ends there.  From ""no"" we ask ""What is the answer to the question?"" which goes to ""What is the question?"" which begs the question of ""Why is the question unanswered?"".  If you keep that cycle going, you get into an infinite philosophical debate to which you might never escape.  TL;DR: Yes. Yes it is."

riddles,3981sz,Cyclops_lazy_laser_I,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:10:07 2015 UTC,Yes I gave my full explanation to the OP and you are mostly correct as ash is most definitely lighter than a feather :)  Congratulations. I hope you enjoyed it.
riddles,3981sz,GrimmReaperx7,1 point,Fri Jun 12 09:02:28 2015 UTC,"Correct! It is Ash  And now the explanation. :)   Obviously I am thinking about the dual use of the word ash it being both the remains of burning and the tree. Ashes can be white and the tree will be green and the blackening in the dead of night is when the fire burns out and all is left is blackened ashes. Ashes are light and blow on the wind and Ash trees are tall and strong. Interesting enough and I could have used it as a further clue, ash wood was the preferred material when it came to spear shafts as it was strong, straight and flexible. The final clue in the rhyme is of course adding the SEA C to it and making CASH  As for the other clues I was dropping in the replies the first one was from Psalm 102 which is commonly known as Do Not Hide Your Face From Me which goes as thus:  In my distress I groan aloud and am reduced to skin and bones.  I am like a desert owl, like an owl among the ruins.  I lie awake; I have become like a bird alone on a roof  All day long my enemies taunt me; those who rail against me use my name as a curse.  For I eat ashes as my food and mingle my drink with tears   Close but no cigar? Well smoking produces ash   and    I am starting to look very pale, especially because I feel ill, shocked, or frightened.  Ashen Faced   Smouldering, I was getting lazy at this point. :)  So congratulations! I hope you enjoyed it and maybe feel prepared enough to look at my other riddles."

riddles,395e1n,sCUMs82,10,Tue Jun 9 11:14:53 2015 UTC,"39  I don't think the solution to a puzzle like this should yield a fraction of a bird as part of the answer, so I sought a logical answer that was also integral.  I think the last point ""And yourself"" implies not that you need to subtract yourself from the 100... but rather that you need to include yourself in the bird's use of the word ""us"".  So incorporating ""yourself"" into ""us"" for each of the lines 1 through 4 yields 100 if there are 39 birds total.  Of course: (1 + 3/4 + 1/2 + 1/4)*(39 + 1) = 100"

riddles,39ahiu,cmubigguy,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:50:49 2015 UTC,"The equation you're using is wrong. A correct equation is $100 originally given to Chester = $97 for the shirt +  $1 kept by Chester + $2 returned to Chester's parents. This makes sense. Another correct equation is $100 originally given to Chester = $98 owed to Chester's parents + $2 paid to them already. This also make sense. But adding $98 + $1 makes no sense. We can't add the money still owed to his parents to the money kept by Chester and expect it to add up to the original amount.    I'm going to explain this a different way by substituting the different variables for letters: A = $100 originally given to Chester B = $2 returned to Chester's parents C = $98 owed to Chester's parents D = $1 kept by Chester We know that A=B+C . This makes sense. But you're trying to make A=C+D, which is wrong. Here's why. If your equation were true, then we should be able to say that B+C=C+D, which simplifies to B+C-C=D, or even simplier, B=D. But B can't always be equal to D, because as we've seen from the story. B=2 and D=1. So yeah, basically your equation A=C+D is fundamentally wrong."
riddles,39ahiu,greyshark,0,Fri Jun 12 21:54:17 2015 UTC,That doesn't even make sense. 49 is the debt and 1 is how much you have left over. So its 50+50-2=98 and 98/2 is 49. You owe them 99 dollars (49+49+1).
