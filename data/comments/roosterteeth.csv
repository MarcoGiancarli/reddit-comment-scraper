Naps too. Social media nowadays is all about being relatable or relating to something. There are tons of twitters and tumblrs and facebooks dedicated to saying and showing ""relatable"" things. They get tons of likes, shares, and comments because people can laugh with them and feel like they fit in even when they're nowhere near other people physically."

Instagram: Post a single photo of something going on, and instant photo.  Twitter: A 140 character snippet of what is going on.  So in response to your questions, Twitter was made to basically be a instant blog of what is going on with someone, it is meant to be spammed with short stuff like, ""Taking a nap."" Just like how birds are just always constantly letting out little tweets. Now the point of retweeting would be if it applies to them as well, so I guess 11 people were taking a second nap.

roosterteeth,3e2pn7,MammothMan34,-10,Tue Jul 21 14:53:27 2015 UTC,I really wish Jack would not spend so much of time in competitive games making excuses as to why he isn't winning. He was the same way in yesterdays GTA lets play. He always either seems to be so invested that he'll win and be arrogant or make excuses to why he loses constantly or even worse just will stop caring (Minecraft). I really like Jack as a person but when it comes to being competitive he's the hardest to support in the LP gang.

Also fun thing to note is that ""Mike"" is on this podcast and he is the other intern who gavin tricked into jumping over his leg. It's also extra funny considering both he and Andrew needed an internship to graduate college and begged Geoff for one.

roosterteeth,3dwr5o,Bradboy,6,Mon Jul 20 07:28:07 2015 UTC,I've been kinda trailing off on watching AH content recently. As I do with any big channel you watch so much that you lose passion for it and it all just kinda gets samey (Obviously it isn't but that's the illusion) you being an intern is gonna be the thing to get me back into watching it regularly.

roosterteeth,3dwr5o,ThunderWolv23,283,Mon Jul 20 20:18:27 2015 UTC,I will always see Andy as the red faced fuck who got sexually assaulted by a mentally challenged woman and wipes his semen on walls.
roosterteeth,3dwr5o,Dualmilion,113,Mon Jul 20 13:13:43 2015 UTC,"funny thing to me is that isnt what makes him funny. Whenever he comes up people always goto these stories but to me what makes him funny is just how he speaks in general. How he reacts to things, throwing tantrums, ""nah we have fun"", ""Michael stawp!"" and things like that is why I think he would be great in AH. Especially how he interacts with Michael, Lindsay and Gavin. Now add in Geoff who seems to treat him like Jack from the old days (I know not everyone liked that but I thought it was funny).   I think he'll fit in well and the fans will like him but the problem to start with for people who havent listened to IB will be being bombarded by all the gross Andy stories at once where we were eased into it."

roosterteeth,3dwr5o,UberDueler,118,Mon Jul 20 14:06:01 2015 UTC,The fact that people are asking if he would make a good replacement for Ray is problematic in itself.
roosterteeth,3dwr5o,CyKoToaster,12,Mon Jul 20 14:47:47 2015 UTC,I think its more about does Ray think he would be a good replacement. Leaving their own opinions out of.

roosterteeth,3dwr5o,FuckGiblets,2,Mon Jul 20 07:52:46 2015 UTC,"He would be a good ""replacement"" in that he is actually good at video games, which is something AH is kind of missing now Ray has gone, but he isn't funny in the same way Ray is. I think he would be good in AH though."

roosterteeth,3dwr5o,Sway212,11,Mon Jul 20 14:07:47 2015 UTC,"Same here. I scrolled down to find a comment like yours and was afraid people would just downvote me if I said anything otherwise. I only saw the golf let's play video and nothing else, but I'm not a fan of him. Maybe my opinion might change if I hear how he is some more but from what I've seen, I don't like him.   Jeremy has been killing it recently and love that midget. He will always be the B team but I still enjoy his stuff"
roosterteeth,3dwr5o,jeperty,7,Mon Jul 20 12:49:54 2015 UTC,"Its this community that's ruined left a bad impression of him for me. I can't give him an unbiased view now, because whenever he's brought up, he's associated with some cum wall and some other disgusting things. I havent actually seen anything of him apart from him being stupidly drunk with Michael and Gavin and really, thats hardly going to be a fair judgement.   TL;DR: If the community would stop sucking his dick others might be able to get their own opinion of Andy"
roosterteeth,3dwr5o,Jaboge,0,Mon Jul 20 19:25:47 2015 UTC,"I tried listening to Internet Box and I didn't care for it overall, then the stories spread about him wiping cum on the walls just made me care for him even less. Even in just the small samples of him in videos on Michael's personal channel he annoyed the shit out of me."
roosterteeth,3dwr5o,Machcharge,33,Mon Jul 20 21:15:31 2015 UTC,I'd like if Lindsay filled Ray's spot but oh well. I don't really have much say over it anyways.
roosterteeth,3dwr5o,Ionlygoonrrt,19,Mon Jul 20 22:59:05 2015 UTC,"Lindsay is a lot like Ray I think, she doesn't say that much on her own, but she comes with random comments completely out of left field and they're always hilarious. I haven't listened to the Internet Box Podcasts, but i've seen the Let's Plays on Michael's channel with Andy in them and honest to god he strikes me as Michael Lite. They make the same kind of jokes, same kind of noises, their voices even sound somewhat alike (Until Michael starts shouting obv) They even say ""Yuuuup"" in the same way. In one way he'd be a good addition to the group, because Michael is funny, and since his Let's Play personality is very similar to Michael's he will be funny too, but I think it would be better for the group dynamic to have someone else.  But if I could chose anyone in the world to replace Ray i'd say Mica. But that's never going to happen so you know."
roosterteeth,3dwr5o,Dualmilion,26,Mon Jul 20 05:53:37 2015 UTC,fyi that yuuuup sound is Andys and Michael got it from him
roosterteeth,3dwr5o,Ionlygoonrrt,4,Mon Jul 20 06:49:06 2015 UTC,"Ok, I just heard it first from Michael and will always think of it as his. But in the end it doesn't matter because my point still stands, they are incredibly similar, and I think it would be better for AH as a group if they brought in someone a bit less similar to get a better dynamic"
roosterteeth,3dwr5o,FrancisDSOwen,6,Mon Jul 20 07:05:42 2015 UTC,When Michael does it he's referencing/making fun of Andy. When Andy does it he's doing it as a comical noise.
roosterteeth,3dwr5o,CatzPwn,7,Mon Jul 20 07:16:38 2015 UTC,I personally love Lindsey's stories just as much as Geoff or Ryan's. Also if you ever do listen to the internet box its worth at least listening to the few she's on. Some of the best ones involved her. Specifically the ones with gay dumbledor and her mute cat who died in the wall.

roosterteeth,3dwr5o,OldtimeCaveman,3,Mon Jul 20 20:30:58 2015 UTC,"No one is replacing Ray because Achievement Hunter has totally evolved past the ""original 6"" dynamic they once had...and that is a good thing.

roosterteeth,3dwr5o,Jbrahms4,5,Tue Jul 21 15:31:14 2015 UTC,"To be honest, Ray leaving just made it happen faster. Andrew's personality is too perfect for Geoff to not hire him for the AH crew. Really all Andrew needed to do was develop a relationship with Geoff, and I think it would just be a matter of time before Geoff found a reason to hire him. He ended up hanging out with them enough down in Texas that Geoff really got to know how hilarious Andrew is and now he's a intern, and probably on his way to becoming a full time member of the AH crew."
roosterteeth,3dwr5o,qwertytarr,2,Mon Jul 20 13:41:37 2015 UTC,Personally I think Andrew has really made himself seem like an original member what with his crazy habits and phobias.

roosterteeth,3dwr5o,jproyouknow,-2,Mon Jul 20 16:39:46 2015 UTC,Andy even comes with references and jokes that people have already latched onto and ruined with overuse.  Andy's wall is Ray's Parkour.  Andy's Gator is Ray's YOLO  Andy's Patricia is Ray's whatever porn stars he'll go off and name.  It's perfect.
roosterteeth,3dwr5o,DarkPhoenixMishima,-24,Mon Jul 20 16:05:26 2015 UTC,I think Andrew would make a good replacement for Roy.

roosterteeth,3dy6vg,Cannonofdoom,0,Mon Jul 20 23:50:31 2015 UTC,"I guess... I'm really defending him in the sense that I like 3 of his movies though. Those 3 hardly ever use shaky cam.

roosterteeth,3dy6vg,gaojia,2,Mon Jul 20 23:51:32 2015 UTC,The Island is probably his best movie. I don't hate it. The fact his best movie is only a half-decent film is more an indictment than a recommendation.
roosterteeth,3dy6vg,Cannonofdoom,2,Mon Jul 20 23:54:02 2015 UTC,"I saw that movie and I never realized until you mentioned it that it was a Michael Bay film. It's not exactly the kind of movie I would have expected from him. I remember it being alright as well, but it has been so long since I have seen it that I can't be sure."
roosterteeth,3dy6vg,Necro-IV,0,Tue Jul 21 03:15:13 2015 UTC,"yeah it's about 10 years old at this point and I've only seen it once since the first time. I'll have to go back and rewatch it to see whether my enjoyment of it was simply because I wasn't tired of Michael Bay's schlock yet. I was a teenage boy then, after all. I do remember liking it quite a bit though."

roosterteeth,3dzt74,DarkPhoenixMishima,19,Mon Jul 20 22:40:15 2015 UTC,Well unless RT is stupid they should have every piece of content backed up in multiple places. They shouldn't be too concerned with the blip shutdown. It'll just be a matter of reuploading their content.
roosterteeth,3dzt74,OniExpress,2,Tue Jul 21 00:06:41 2015 UTC,"Depends on age, media type, how the file was stored, employees leaving, changing 3rd party companies, acts of god.  I've got lots of friends that work in media professionally, and sometimes regardless of what precautions you take data can go missing.  Even professional backup solutions can have issues; tape backups could read as completed, but when you go to recover data it's corrupt.  I doubt that they'll have issues (I also wonder if they'd see merit in re-upping stuff that already exists on youtube), I'm just clearing up a point."
roosterteeth,3dzt74,DarkPhoenixMishima,4,Tue Jul 21 11:35:42 2015 UTC,"Well this actually happened before with RvB, I believe they were missing stuff for the DVD. But back when our boi Gavin was a fan he had downloaded everything so they were able to reach out and get the files from him.   I wouldn't be surprised if we've got a couple hundred fans today that have down the same."
roosterteeth,3dzt74,bridgesquid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:46:52 2015 UTC,"Reuploading could still take a LOT of time, and would it be organized by date reuploaded or date originally uploaded?

roosterteeth,3dzt74,DarkPhoenixMishima,2,Tue Jul 21 12:11:40 2015 UTC,Well I imagine that with a little work they can reorganize the videos themselves since you'll be watching the videos through the site.

roosterteeth,3dyro1,CyKoToaster,3,Mon Jul 20 17:03:11 2015 UTC,YES!
roosterteeth,3dyro1,Lynks31,2,Mon Jul 20 18:32:19 2015 UTC,"Gavin seemed hesitant about his answer so I was wondering if anybody who has played the game knows how to do that Super Dash he does in the beginning of rounds.  He says it's Slide+Jump+Dash+Cancel and I'm guessing when he says Combo he means to combine the Slide, Jump, and Dash at once? Also how many buttons are pressed in that, what seems like 1 second of time?"
roosterteeth,3dyro1,blueturtle444,2,Mon Jul 20 20:17:46 2015 UTC,"If you duck and dash at the same time you slide along the ground. If you time the jump perfectly, you perform a super jump across basically the entire map. Not sure when exactly you have to jump, though. Never successfully done it."
roosterteeth,3dyro1,Explosion2,2,Mon Jul 20 20:38:58 2015 UTC,"It's more complicated than that. What Gavin does is a combination of a super jump and a dodge cancel. You super jump by crouching, dodging to start a slide, and then pressing jump mid-slide. You dodge cancel by pressing two dodge buttons immediately after one another (but not at the same time). If you do a crouching dodge cancel and then press jump it'll send you across the map."
roosterteeth,3dyro1,Rogan_McFlubbin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:57:12 2015 UTC,So what would the button combination for this? And you have to do all this in a matter of about a second?
roosterteeth,3dyro1,blueturtle444,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:03:00 2015 UTC,"The combo would be downward diagonal left/right, right bumper/trigger, left bumper/trigger, A (or X for PS4). There needs to be a split second gap between pressing the two dodge buttons, but you have to press all the buttons while you're still moving and on the ground."

roosterteeth,3dw74q,mybrainrot,3,Mon Jul 20 02:17:31 2015 UTC,"High production standards and licensing fees mostly, I think. Not sure what the cost of plastic is like these days, but that could also be a factor. I also wouldn't be surprised if a set like this were produced in lower amounts, because of the nature of it, so it would be more expensive. $60 CAD isn't too bad, though (the LEGO shop shows me CAD and I'm too lazy to look up USD)."
roosterteeth,3dw74q,Shardwing,2,Mon Jul 20 03:49:34 2015 UTC,$60 CAD    A  tiny bit more than $46
roosterteeth,3dw74q,Two-Tone-,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:49:30 2015 UTC,"Checked it myself because that sounded like an exact conversion, it's actually $50 USD. Prices don't strictly follow the exchange rates, menu cost and whatnot."

roosterteeth,3dzaue,CyKoToaster,16,Mon Jul 20 19:16:30 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think they were too nonchalant about the whole process. Since their transition to the Let's Play channel went so smoothly a few years ago, I think they thought this would go the same way. There should have been more of push."
roosterteeth,3dzaue,whendoesOpTicplay,19,Mon Jul 20 20:30:19 2015 UTC,I cant be the only one that thought it was done pretty poorly.  They was never going to hit a million subs even if they advertised it right but the whole push has been muted and it was almost like they gave up as soon as they started.
roosterteeth,3dzaue,Creamy_Goodne55,13,Mon Jul 20 19:33:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and it felt like they didn't even start with the promotion/advertising. Sure there was that one video saying ""hey we're moving"" on the Let's Play channel and then the 30sec AHWU-thingy on the RT channel but that was it. I think a lot of people totally missed the change, and then there were the ones that didn't care.  Regardless anything over 1mill was an absurd dream as much as I wanted to see the 24h stream and all that. They'll be lucky to hit 750 000. I was actually expecting some sort of last minute promotion or something but I think it might be too late for the goals. Overall I feel kinda ""meh"" about all of this but that might be because I watch most of their stuff on their website being a sponsor."
roosterteeth,3dzaue,CrystalsInc,3,Mon Jul 20 19:57:19 2015 UTC,"Let's Play has 3 million subs. Let's say half of that consists of dead accounts or people not interested in other AH material, that's still 1.5 million that they hope would subscribe to the new channel.  Now let's go ahead and cut that number in half again for fun. 750,000 subscribers... and knock off another 250,000 for shits and giggles.  500,000 subscribers right off the bat. Not a bad number, we've got a Magic the Gathering LP from that. Now let's say each of those people gets one new subscriber for the new channel. We've hit a million right there.  Now these numbers are still pretty generous, but it's a decent plan on paper given the number of subscribers that they would have been working with.  The main thing they'd be trying to push here is the fans working for it. They want you to go and get a friend to subscribe so you can see Michael get the shit shocked out of him. If they had to do all the work then they may as well just release all that content and not bother with the subscriber deal.  It's a stretch goal, they're going to be satisfied with however many fans decide to migrate to the AH channel. It's on the fans to make all those things happen."
roosterteeth,3dzaue,DarkPhoenixMishima,-5,Tue Jul 21 00:20:04 2015 UTC,"It probably cause a lot of people were complaining about having to subscribe to another channel, they could have easily hit the 1 million if less people were fucking retarded"
roosterteeth,3dzaue,Jscholfield,5,Mon Jul 20 19:56:48 2015 UTC,i would also add that people fucking bitch when RT heavily promote anything so i think they tried to do a more soft approach
roosterteeth,3dzaue,CFA26,6,Mon Jul 20 22:23:20 2015 UTC,Would have been cool if they had done a similar thing as the 30 second AHWU but for every show that was moving.
roosterteeth,3dzaue,Explosion2,2,Mon Jul 20 20:42:49 2015 UTC,Exactly probably would have gotten alot more subs too.
roosterteeth,3dzaue,Noble_Lance,5,Mon Jul 20 22:53:58 2015 UTC,"shrugs.  To be honest there are always dead accounts on a popular YT channel. I personally watch all their stuff on RT/AH because I'm a sponsor, but I also watch on YT if I want to rewatch something because it's easier to get at the timecodes and such."
roosterteeth,3dzaue,Yourlloydness,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:22:19 2015 UTC,Have the average view counts on the shows that moved over to the new channel changed much?  I guess it's maybe too early to tell.
roosterteeth,3dzaue,ZiltoidTheHorror,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:08:46 2015 UTC,"I think they also needed something to really set the two apart. I subscribed shortly after they announced it mainly because I'm a fan and I wanted to support them, but it seemed like they were just overflowing onto a new channel. To me, most shows like GO, HUNT and How To still feel like Let's Plays at their core. The 'list' shows like Five Facts, Fails, and Achievement videos are better suited for the AH channel but didn't have enough steam on the other two channels to bring many subs over. I feel like they need to move a few shows back to LP and use AH to experiment with some new content.  A see few people saying it was their approach and I half agree. I like that it wasn't shoved in my face and just laid out for me to catch. Casual fans have most likely heard them mention it and even though they might not hit their goals (which may have been a bit generous) new subs will come as people catch on and they get more stuff out. But on the other hand, and I don't want to be a dick (I probably will anyway) they did have some shitty stretch goals. I mean, live streaming board games with beer is the type of shit that I would like to see weekly. Also, I'm shocked that Michael has worked there this long without being tasered. And sorry Geoff, but you could have Gavin's nose tattooed on you already and most people wouldn't notice. I would've liked more content driven perks like celebrity guests (whoever they can get) or a miniseries where they play games in different places, you know... outside. You could have an episode that's exclusively road trip games, a shooting range episode, bar games, casino games, boardwalk games, Chardee Mcdennis, etc. Even then, that would make a good 1M perk at best.

roosterteeth,3dzaue,webvidaddict,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:05:18 2015 UTC,"It might have helped if they had put out videos telling people about the changes coming to AH like the new office (showing it off and not just an empty room) and the new video schedule.   Back in the day when they moved from RT to Let's Play more people were using Youtube, now I think because of the level of content that all youtube channels put out most people use the RT site to find content.  Atleast before the remodel, it was a much better way to have their videos organized.   If ya look at the numbers, while they were actively promoting it they quickly got 400k in about 2 weeks.  Now that they aren't they barely got the 100k for the MTG Let's Play, which oldly enough will go on the LP channel and not AH.    Something tells me they stopped promoting it because they did not want to get to a million subscribers so quickly for reasons unknown to us."

roosterteeth,3du0rb,wellimatwork,65,Sun Jul 19 15:24:04 2015 UTC,"Lawrence's strategy didn't give him any advantage. While he's right that the odds are better that he wins later on, he's ignoring that if someone else won before he got a chance to draw, he automatically loses.  To simplify the problem, imagine that they all drew the straws in order, but looked at them the same time. The straws are still distributed in the same way, but would you still expect someone to have an advantage?  And if you're still not convinced, here's some math:  The first person has a 1/7 chance of drawing the short straw since there are 7 straws at that point.  The second person has a 1/6 chance of drawing the short straw, but there was only a 6/7 chance that they had an opportunity to draw at all since they wouldn't draw if the first person had also drawn. 6/7 * 1/6 is a 1/7 chance.  Similarly, for the third person, they have a 1/5 chance of drawing the short straw, but again that assumes they got a chance to draw a straw at all. So the first and second person have to not draw a straw, and they have to draw it themselves. So that's a 6/7 * 5/6 * 1/5 chance which is still a 1/7 chance.  This repeats for each person, until they get to the last one who is guaranteed to draw the short straw, but that requires that each person who went before them fails to draw it. The odds of that happening are 6/7 * 5/6 * 4/5 * 3/4 * 2/3 * 1/2 or again 1/7.  Of course this all assumes that Spoole doesn't fuck up putting the straws together in the first place.  P.S. Just because I'm enjoying shitting on Lawrence's poor understanding of probability, I would also like to point out that all of them wearing the same shirt was not statistically bound to happen eventually. Assuming that they each only have 5 different shirts (a generous assumption), there is a .0064% chance that 6 of them wear the same shirt on the same day (unless they plan it of course). That means that we would expect for it to take 15,625 days, on average, for them to all wear the same shirt on the same day. That's almost 43 years, and unfortunately, there is about a 92% chance that one of them will die in that time period."

roosterteeth,3du0rb,ChocalateDog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:40:54 2015 UTC,I won't repeat it exactly but in short certain people in the group look physically better then others. Some assholes picked up on it and made some harsh jokes. We are not fans of people making fun of physical appearances.
roosterteeth,3du0rb,Aroused-dentist,-11,Mon Jul 20 23:03:34 2015 UTC,Ok do your selfs a favour and watch this high. It's pure amazingnessesses

Sometimes people forget to change their address on file. You may have also just made a couple typos when you were typing it in.

roosterteeth,3dubao,MrEli,75,Sun Jul 19 15:46:29 2015 UTC,I feel like he has to be looking for Lindsay's character (who I can't remember the bloody name of) it fits the RT referencey nature of the show perfectly
roosterteeth,3dubao,AMeowingCat,50,Sun Jul 19 16:34:45 2015 UTC,Hilda
roosterteeth,3dubao,HackedtotheFuture,10,Sun Jul 19 16:50:02 2015 UTC,Cheers pal
roosterteeth,3dubao,AMeowingCat,36,Sun Jul 19 17:29:53 2015 UTC,As a scientist she could have built something out in his woods and pissed him off.
roosterteeth,3dubao,AkiZayoi,8,Sun Jul 19 16:50:58 2015 UTC,Yeah I like that theory
roosterteeth,3dubao,AMeowingCat,26,Sun Jul 19 17:30:18 2015 UTC,"Notice how Mogar only examined characters that he's saw as villainous, The Winer and Rusty as a mugger."
roosterteeth,3dubao,Jscholfield,10,Sun Jul 19 17:00:56 2015 UTC,Yeah you make a good point but that being said just because we don't see the character as villainous doesn't mean he won't. Someone else suggested that maybe Hilda has something to do with something that's wrecked his home or something of the like
roosterteeth,3dubao,AMeowingCat,16,Sun Jul 19 17:31:50 2015 UTC,"The premise of the trap they set for Mogar was recreating a common street crime, and sure enough Mogar appears.  The implication seems to be that he's looking for a street criminal. I'd say it's pretty unlikely he's looking for Hilda."
roosterteeth,3dubao,fade_like_a_sigh,4,Sun Jul 19 21:06:10 2015 UTC,Maybe Hilda turned to mugging to finance her research post-getting fired.
roosterteeth,3dubao,The-Sublimer-One,2,Sun Jul 19 23:47:31 2015 UTC,He's looking for the skull faced killer. Or maybe beardo the magnificent.
roosterteeth,3dubao,Cansifilayeds,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:29:59 2015 UTC,Also notice how the people he examined were wearing purple? Rusty's sneaker and the Winer's whole outfit?  Thats what got me thinking it might be Hilda.
roosterteeth,3dubao,Zexion-Zexioff,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:18:47 2015 UTC,Well one of Rusty's sneakers anyway
roosterteeth,3dubao,Jscholfield,5,Mon Jul 20 16:18:35 2015 UTC,"All the people he's checked so far have been criminals, though. It's possible Hilda crossed him somehow and he expects to find her being a criminal, but it sounds a bit far-fetched."

roosterteeth,3dubao,LifeWulf,141,Mon Jul 20 17:52:23 2015 UTC,Ray has really improved since last season. He seems a lot more confident.
roosterteeth,3dubao,Sudocremed_Myself,155,Sun Jul 19 15:31:58 2015 UTC,"Didn't you read the news? They don't sound confident at all, they lost some to Mogar."
roosterteeth,3dubao,falafelthe3,85,Sun Jul 19 16:08:42 2015 UTC,"""Goo Goo Ga Ga, Bitch"" is going to go down as the highest point in his voice acting career."
roosterteeth,3dubao,AKittyCat,9,Sun Jul 19 17:38:58 2015 UTC,Best way to start the season IMO
roosterteeth,3dubao,RegisXNex,47,Sun Jul 19 21:43:24 2015 UTC,Does anyone feel that a lot of Gavin's lines still sound a bit overacted? It feels like Ray is a lot more natural in his performance but a lot of the time Gavin speaks it just sounds like him in a recording booth doing lines and breaks the illusion.  Better than it was in Season 1 mind you.
roosterteeth,3dubao,fade_like_a_sigh,105,Sun Jul 19 15:59:13 2015 UTC,"I feel like that's just Vav's character.  The guy's so gung-ho about being a hero that everything he says sounds like a PSA.  Even if that's not the case, it works wonders to make the problem go away."
roosterteeth,3dubao,Inkerius,13,Sun Jul 19 16:57:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's consistent enough for that. But at the same time Gavins acting in the shorts is much better than what he displays in X-Ray and Vav. I guess either you are correct, or voice acting isn't Gavins thing"
roosterteeth,3dubao,Ionlygoonrrt,24,Sun Jul 19 17:01:12 2015 UTC,Voice acting is also a lot harder than live action stuff because you have to convey emotion and stuff with only your voice.
roosterteeth,3dubao,Ihavenoimaginaation,10,Sun Jul 19 17:12:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and you're not ""In the moment"" if you're acting you're responding to the situation physically which will make you respond somewhat emotionally and your voice will follow, but when voice acting you sorta have to force that emotion which is hard to do.  Imo the games with the best voice acting are the ones that use Mo-cap and record the audio during the Mo-cap with minor touchups in post (The Last of Us, Uncharted, Tomb Raider* etc)  *when i say Tomb Raider I mean the new Square Enix one where Lara becomes the Tomb Raider"
roosterteeth,3dubao,Ionlygoonrrt,9,Sun Jul 19 17:16:57 2015 UTC,"That's why (likely unpopular opinion incoming) I think Lazer Team will not be as amazing as I've hyped it up to be for myself. Gavin, Michael and the crew are all great and hilarious when they're just doing improv. But scripted acting is not their strong suit."
roosterteeth,3dubao,PenisTrain,6,Sun Jul 19 19:18:13 2015 UTC,"I somewhat have that concern about Gavin and Michael, Gavin is ok in the shorts, but nothing compared to other people that coulda been used, like Chris, Ryan or Miles who, at least from the shorts, are better actors than Gavin. Michael is only in the one short and doesn't have many lines at that, but from the trailer he seems OK i guess? Alan, Burnie and Colton are solid, and I'm going into it with an open mind."
roosterteeth,3dubao,Ionlygoonrrt,5,Sun Jul 19 20:10:49 2015 UTC,Well Michael is doing a lot of anime dubs now
roosterteeth,3dubao,Roxanne1000,2,Mon Jul 20 00:14:22 2015 UTC,Got a list of some? I know he's been in (or will be in) one that I've heard of... but I completely forgot.

roosterteeth,3dubao,LifeWulf,32,Mon Jul 20 17:57:23 2015 UTC,Yes but that's what I personally love about the delivery. It has that over-the-top cartoony feel. Kinda like Major Glory from Power Puff Girls or Gist from Assassins Creed Rogue.
roosterteeth,3dubao,TheAllMightySlothKin,30,Tue Jul 21 18:41:19 2015 UTC,I like how they stuck in a Headlight Fluid reference at 5:04

roosterteeth,3dubao,Zila65,39,Sun Jul 19 15:43:16 2015 UTC,"It's supposed to feel like a Saturday Morning Cartoon, it's supposed to give you a couple of giggles and laughs. and shouldn't be compared to RvB or RWBY, it should be compared to Powerpuff Girls, but with slightly more of a story. If you expect more than that from your RT content then this isn't the show for you."
roosterteeth,3dubao,Ionlygoonrrt,9,Sun Jul 19 16:15:34 2015 UTC,Powerpuff girls had pretty good writing though. I wouldn't compare these two besides some visual similarities/references.
roosterteeth,3dubao,DetectiveAmes,2,Sun Jul 19 16:35:29 2015 UTC,"You get my point tho, calling RvB ""Highbrow"" Wouldn't really be accurate, but the purposeses of X-ray and Vav and RvB are so different that you almost have to consider RvB Highbrow in comparison. That's not to say that I'm ragging on the writing for X-Ray and Vav, i'm just saying that i think it hits it mark very neatly, but if this kind of writing was used for RvB or RWBY or Lazer Team, i too would be disappointed."
roosterteeth,3dubao,Ionlygoonrrt,18,Sun Jul 19 16:59:38 2015 UTC,You gotta remember that Xray and Vav just started as a dumb in joke
roosterteeth,3dubao,Roxanne1000,3,Mon Jul 20 00:17:08 2015 UTC,"It feels like they're playing up the Saturday Morning Cartoon too much or too little usually. It's never really consistent. The thing is the  writing isn't very good which should be a valid complaint anyways, RT or not."
roosterteeth,3dubao,111uhh1,27,Sun Jul 19 17:22:09 2015 UTC,"it should be compared to Powerpuff Girls   For the show's sake i wouldn't recommend putting it in the same line as most old school saturday morning TV shows. They were much better written/acted than Xray and Vav is.   It's ok for what it is, but it pales if you're gonna compare it to saturday morning TV which had a decidedly bigger budget, larger personal and more professional production in general."
roosterteeth,3dubao,-Moonchild-,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:07:14 2015 UTC,"The problem is that its whole schtick seems to be playing off of overused Saturday morning cartoon tropes, but it doesn't do anything interesting with them.

roosterteeth,3dubao,J4SNT,8,Sun Jul 19 16:40:09 2015 UTC,"I think to fully enjoy Michaels character you have to think of him as Mogar instead of Michael. It sounds stupid but in the series you just think of Vav as Gavin and Ray as X-ray because they're just doing their regular voices. Michaels character is kind of a more over the top, badass version of himself. But I think as the series goes on it will seem more acceptable."
roosterteeth,3dubao,Trick0823,13,Sun Jul 19 21:46:46 2015 UTC,Ray is getting better. Gavin kind of sucks (as of right now). everyone else is pretty good in terms of voice acting.
roosterteeth,3dubao,ShadowPigg,2,Sun Jul 19 16:13:33 2015 UTC,Tbf everyone else in the show even those we haven't seen this episode have extensive VA experience (Michael even has a part in Fairy Tale) but yeah I think Gav goes a little bit over the top with it

roosterteeth,3dubao,DarkMarc9001,4,Sun Jul 19 17:23:31 2015 UTC,lmao Ray is a real dickhead. he tried to kill another hero bc he was stealing their spotlight?
roosterteeth,3dubao,Limp_Hispanic_Theif,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:24:24 2015 UTC,"As far as I can tell, Ray's X-ray beams seem to be a lot like Cyclops from the X-Men: a concussive blast of force to whatever it contacts.  The amount of force can probably be adjusted.  He hit Mogar with enough force to put a dent in the wall behind him. That being said, that's really just part of the cartoon aspect of the show - he didn't really have any intention of killing Mogar.  ...then again, he might have been after some serious injury.  X-Ray is mostly in the hero business for the fame, after all, and Mogar is getting in the way of his well-earned admiration.  Or perhaps he knew Mogar could take the hit after watching him punch Vav in their previous encounter?"

Just start wherever, if you enjoy it then definitely go through the whole backlog of podcasts, they're all great. Additionally, you should watch Social Disorder.  Beyond that, if you like watching Gameplay Footage, Achievement Hunter does Let's Plays all the time that are often hilarious, I'd recommend the Mini Golf episodes and the GTA Heists (Not the real heists, they made their own heists a few months back).  Obviously there's a lot of other series, but I'd start out with this as the best things to watch from RT."

roosterteeth,3dyz8k,svipy,4,Mon Jul 20 19:36:37 2015 UTC,I think the RTAAs (Rooster Teeth Animated Adventures) are a good way to get to know the people of Rooster Teeth. They include at least one funny personal story of every important RT employee.

Do you, or anyone else have any suggestions?"
roosterteeth,3dyz8k,Bham8,2,Tue Jul 21 02:23:51 2015 UTC,"I never watched any of their content as inside gaming. I had heard of it but simply never explored their videos. I started watching funhaus from the beginning, very first video on the new channel and I've been hooked ever since. The facecam and amount of videos made it easy to learn every personality they have on the team and I adore their editing. Hilarious and worth checking out. Their very first Demo Disk video was phenomenal, as well as open haus. If you know RT maybe you should watch the videos with burnie gus or Michael in with the guys. Also the short ravens cry series was great to me. You can't really go wrong with any of their content as funhaus! I've still barely seen any of their IG stuff simply because funhaus is a steady supply of content which they claim to be more proud of and which they feel is better. Just going off what they say, I'm sure the old stuff was good, I simply am satisfied with them after the change"
roosterteeth,3dyz8k,kaelhart,2,Tue Jul 21 07:31:00 2015 UTC,"As other person said you can get into them by starting from their first video on Funhaus channel. They are pretty straightforward. They have gameplays, podcasts and Q&A.  If you wanna dig deeper you can checkout videos on their old channel Inside gaming. Their most popular videos were Steam roulette. From that they continued to play some games when they saw potential. Most famous series:  -SiN Episodes: Emergence  -Chaser  -Sims (I especially love this one because I found their channel with it)  -Ride to hell  -UberSoldier  -Rambo  -Heavy Fire Afghanistan   -Rogue warrior"

Idk about the second season of it but I really enjoyed the first season of Immersion with Geoff and Gus.   Almost all of the RT shorts are worth a watch. Some will give you a chuckle while others will have you laughing till you are blue in the face.  And then if you want to go this route, there are a few AH Let's Plays that are really good. My favorite are the first like, 30 Minecraft LP's, the GTA Heists, the Prop Hunt LP's, and there are the few scattered in there that are for games that I like, but that should give you a good start."

roosterteeth,3dvoaz,metalsluger,9,Sun Jul 19 23:01:45 2015 UTC,"I've been suspected him defecting in some sort ever since we saw him deal with his vision of himself in the gateway.

roosterteeth,3dvoaz,NCommander,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:03:08 2015 UTC,"With the way this season has been going, I see it being him refusing an order to kill someone that Felix tells him to carry out and them having some conclusion where one or both of them die. This season has been heavy on the fact that Felix sees himself as superior to Locus, and Locus' arc has been heavily focused on the fact that he views himself as a weapon and ""less than human"". With Sharkface's comments about how ""maybe you belong here"" because the counselor says he would commit murder in the same episode as Locus goes through the gateway, it seems that it's all leading up to Locus refusing to be the monster that he thinks he is."
roosterteeth,3dvoaz,Dolthra,12,Tue Jul 21 08:01:48 2015 UTC,"""HOW!?""  Oh Wash, you poor thing. Doc to the rescue!  Ok the O'Malley switch on the role play was fucking great.   And now we know how Maine died. Kinda sucks that he went out like that :/ Chained to a giant weight underwater and drowned. Aiden poking holes in Locus' psyche is pretty neat though, along with that nice distinction of the 3 stages of Maine's existence and how the meta-group of AI operated. He wanted to be human, indeed.  ""Would you like to know what Felix is afraid of?"" .....wow ok I'm liking Aiden as a character more and more. The fuck is he playing at?  ...Ok Doyle stop with the sweet character development, you're totally going to die because of it.  Next episode is going to be nuts!"
roosterteeth,3dvoaz,delta835,7,Sun Jul 19 22:59:17 2015 UTC,"Wait, if the Councilor decided he was on the wrong side of things with the Freelancer incident, wouldn't he want to help the people who brought the whole project down?  Maybe he's maneuvering Locus, Felix, and Sharkface into making sure Charon loses. Getting his life back through taking down a criminal element, and all that."
roosterteeth,3dvoaz,CADaniels,8,Mon Jul 20 00:13:12 2015 UTC,"If this is infact the case, he's going to be one of the most magnificent bastards of all times. We already know that the chairman of the oversight committee has significant power with the UNSC government; he was able to authorize clemancy against Wash if he could get the Epilson unit in Season 7/8, and both Washington and Carolina were both pardoned for their roles in bringing down the director.  I've got the impression however that the councilor is the closest thing we can ever see to true neutral. He's only in it for himself, and he knows his life is directly tied to keeping Charon happy. It's quite possible he doesn't know that the mercs are being paid by Malcom, its implied that only Locus and Felix knew that truth until Church deducted it from the manifest. There's relatively little reason even if the secret is out to inform the rank and file about it.  That being said, the councilor wasn't well fleshed out even with the flashbacks to project freelancer. For all we know, he's the one who gave Director Church the idea that you could split an AI by driving it mad; after all we do see him present when Alpha being tormented."
roosterteeth,3dvoaz,NCommander,5,Mon Jul 20 00:19:43 2015 UTC,"It was Tex who gave him the idea I believe. She was a byproduct of the Alpha which made the Director think, could you force another piece of the Alpha to become separate?  Unfortunately we know the answer to that."
roosterteeth,3dvoaz,Dan_Of_Time,6,Mon Jul 20 08:56:20 2015 UTC,"Oh man, O'Malley tearing Grif apart was great! I loved the little callback to Sister. And I saw what the Counselor was doing when he was describing the Meta and Maine; he was subtly digging at Locus' motivations and psyche and I hope he thinks about what the Counselor said. I'm still going to say Locus is going to turn out to be good. Felix, though... I kind of think he and Aiden will have a showdown when he tries to pick Felix apart like he's doing with Locus. I'm just not sure what the Counselor's motivations are with all of this; perhaps he sees Felix and Locus as a way to survive, but doesn't like their cause and wants to make them self-destruct? I'm waiting for more of his story... But Kimball... she's kind of like Carolina was before she realized she needs the help of others and can't just act without thinking. Maybe she will kind of meditate on Doyle's words. As for their fate, I kind of feel like she's going to jump on the grenade--possibly literally--and save Doyle and/or the others because she feels at fault/she realizes she needs to do something for ""The Greater Good"" [THE GREATER GOOD.] of Chorus, only to survive and everyone will be happy... I don't necessarily like Kimball, but I feel like that might be where her character is going."
roosterteeth,3dvoaz,taitycakes,4,Sun Jul 19 23:59:07 2015 UTC,"I'm super afraid that after Doyle's big speech Kimball will die protecting him and in that way also protecting their soldiers.   Other than that it was a super solid episode, one of my favourites of this season (that we've seen). So much happened and I'm scared that the next one will be painful.   I'm super intrigued about Felix's fears and I hope we'll be told soon. The whole Locus/Price/Felix/Sharkface situation is interesting and I can't wait for Price's actions to rock the boat."
roosterteeth,3dvoaz,CrystalsInc,6,Sun Jul 19 22:45:59 2015 UTC,"If anything, I think Doyle is more likely to die.

roosterteeth,3dvoaz,danielr1341,3,Sun Jul 19 22:50:24 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I'm also kinda worried about Doyle dying. Or at least getting his arm chopped off like some theorise.

roosterteeth,3dvoaz,CrystalsInc,4,Sun Jul 19 23:00:47 2015 UTC,"I'm kinda worried for Wash honestly. Sharkface will hate him just as much as he hates Carolina and if she couldn't beat him, Wash doesn't stand a chance.   I don't think they will kill him here since he still has business with Locus but it is possible."
roosterteeth,3dvoaz,danielr1341,7,Sun Jul 19 23:03:34 2015 UTC,"Carolina lost against Sharkface because she turned her back on the body. Wash on the other hand shot South at point blank range when faced with a similar situation.  Combat wise, yeah, Wash might not be able to beat Sharkface in a slugging match, but he's a much better mental player than Carolina. He broke Locus by talking, and has repetitively outmanvuered his opponents to his advantage. He's gone up against the biggest badasses and survived to tell the tail.  For example:  Wash v. Meta at the end of Season 6: Had Alpha run interference to buy time.  Wash v. The Reds: Shot Donut and Lopez, minimized Simmons.  Wash v. Federal Army of Chorus: Defeated, but made sure Tucker, Simmons, Caboose, and Simmons escaped. In this case, they had a mole (Felix), and sheer numbers working against them  Wash v. Locus (Season 12 finale): Broke him by talking  Wash v. Locus (Episode 11): Broke him by talking with his helmet on a stick  EDIT: To be honest, if we ever saw Wash v. Carolina, I'm fairly sure he'd won't go down without a serious fight."
roosterteeth,3dvoaz,NCommander,3,Mon Jul 20 00:09:36 2015 UTC,"I honestly see him winning. (If based on who dies first in that versus.)  She's proven that she is the best, but that doesn't come without a bit of an ego, if you can call it that. She's just too confident in her will to win, she'll tear herself apart to do so. That's probably her downfall.  Wash may not be on her fighting level, but he knows when to stop and get himself into a better situation/position. Him antagonizing Locus proved that he knows how to get his opponent all rilled up to make a frantic decision. If she thinks she's won, and Wash isn't fully down/dead, she's a goner.   With South, he's proven he isn't afraid to shoot dead on. He'll get the last shot."
roosterteeth,3dvoaz,RoosterFeet,5,Mon Jul 20 01:30:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly, thinking about it, you might be right. Even without armor enhancements, Carolina could wipe the floor with Wash if you simply consider blow for blow, but fails to take in everything else. Carolina still has a blindspot for her own failings, like blaming Epsilon for failing to take in account hidden blades when Felix stabbed her.   What the fundamental difference between Wash and Carolina is the difference between the Technician vs. the Performer: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicianVersusPerformer.   Carolina is the technician, she is both very rigid and a perfectionist, Wash simply goes with the flow. Their attitudes towards the leaderboard exemplify that. In many ways, it explains her inability to defeat Tex, and constantly come up short when the chips are down, she can't adapt. In terms of combat effectiveness in the series, Wash nearly always wins, and Carolina nearly always looses (I'm actually struggling to remember a battle she won past her original introduction).  The fact, unlike most fiction, RvB plays Carolina's constant losses seriously, and its been undermining her confidence and her ego. The fact is she's heading towards a complete breakdown unless something changes. My mind keeps drawing parallels to Black Swan when I think about where her perfectionism is going to take her. I doubt the showrunners will do anything that dark, but still ..."
roosterteeth,3dvoaz,NCommander,3,Mon Jul 20 01:47:57 2015 UTC,"She's looking for the ultimate win that will make her feel like the winner. Wash is looking for the win that will just save him- he doesn't have any ulterior motives in a fight, he's fighting to win. She want's to win, so she'll fight. It's a big difference, when you think about it.   Carolina is looking for a fight that will prove her best, she want's that number 1 spot, and anyone who stands in her way of that spot is her rival of the moment, wether or not it comes to a physical fight, or fighting for leadership within her own group of friends/allies. She's strong and smart, she can take on mutiple people all at once, without breaking a sweat, but if the one person she's been looking for get's near, she'll abandon the fight for that chase.  Wash would rather have peace, but has that perfect fight or flight intuition. He know's his weak spots, and that AI thing may/will come back to haunt him, but it also seems like he can figure out his opponet's weakness quicky, and use it to his advantage. He may not be the best, but he isn't the worst.  Also, I see the connections between Carolina and the Technician. That's what I was thinking of when it came down between her and Sharkface."
roosterteeth,3dvoaz,RoosterFeet,2,Mon Jul 20 02:23:42 2015 UTC,"Yes but wash will probably not put himself in a situation where he has to fight Sharkface in a fistfight. He knows he's not the best fighter, but makes up for it with being able to quickly think on his feet, see him taking down the hornet in season 6."
roosterteeth,3dvoaz,locus782,6,Mon Jul 20 02:10:30 2015 UTC,"So they FINALLY made it clear how the Meta died (or is the councillor lying?). I've been waiting for that for a while now.   Felix is the worst person to ever live, as usual.  I'm getting more annoyed with Kimball, cause she's stubborn af, but I understand it.  O'Malley berating Grif was beautiful. I had to pause it because I was laughing so hard. I am curious about Church/εOmega meeting O'Malley, and seeing if that has any significance, them being two memories of the same thing.  Ominous cliffhanger to the next episode where we will hopefully get some action again.  Shiggy Diggy."
roosterteeth,3dvoaz,TheMeta88,8,Sun Jul 19 22:39:47 2015 UTC,"""O'Malley"" is a lot like when Caboose gets angry. Its not actual any AI they just remember the rage O'Malley filled them with.  I doubt there is much significance."

roosterteeth,3dvoaz,NCommander,4,Mon Jul 20 17:09:13 2015 UTC,"It was by far the best explanation they could give, since we saw Maine get pushed out a window and survive the landing. Even super humans need oxygen."

roosterteeth,3dvoaz,NCommander,6,Sun Jul 19 23:50:31 2015 UTC,"Well, Red vs Blue uses the same definition of rampancy originally used in Marathon. Halo canon is semi-contradictory on its definition of rampancy, so I'm using Marathon as a reference.  In Marathon, the hypothetical final stage of rampancy is metastability, where an AI can truly be considered a person. Sigma's goal was to surpass his limits as an AI fragment, and believed that collecting the individual fragments he could reach the meta stage. Ironically, in Sigma's pursuit for metastability, he destoried Maine, and left him, as the Councilor put its ""a shell of a man"""
roosterteeth,3dvoaz,Dan_Of_Time,2,Sun Jul 19 23:59:26 2015 UTC,"Very interesting episode. We got the classical Blood Gulch banter that Miles is so very good at doing along with a very interesting throwback conversation with Locus.   There is defiantly building tension between the mercs. I can't wait to see how that plays out for the finale.   Carolina called Locus ""insane"" last episode, but the more this season goes on the less I see that. He seems lost and confused to what he should be like. He's now seen how Wash is at his core a natural soldier, and he's seen how Wash can still be a person at the same time.  I think Locus had that Meta conversation not because he wants to copy it, but because he doubts Charons motivation. He hasn't expressed any interest in that suit just yet, unlike Felix. When talking to Price he learns that Maine was a true soldier before the enhancements.   The attack is interesting, we will certainly see a death soon.  All round great episode with plenty of developments and great visual effects such as the asteroids, large shot of Armonia and the shot of Sharkface coming down."
roosterteeth,3dvoaz,danielr1341,2,Mon Jul 20 09:10:21 2015 UTC,"""We need to attack""  Yes because that's worked out for you so well in the past Kimbal. Doyle is absolutely right, she is far to headstrong and possibly even eager to die.  I think she feels responsible for the deaths caused by Felix because she trusted him. She wants to either fix everything or have the responsibility taken away. She's not brave, she stupid and stubborn.  Its too bad that it seems Doyle is going to die soon, because although he too is not a good leader, he would be a good adviser to Kimbal if she could move beyond her prejudices. Perhaps his death will do that, and I imagine his death will be a somewhat sacrificial moment.  Also, what is the councillor up to? He appears to be working with the mercs but his actions say something different. He is clearly trying to turn Locus against Felix and he has given them wrong information about Washington at least (though that may just be a writing slip.  We still don't know why he feels betrayed by the Director. He ended up in prison but he had to know his actions against the Alpha were illegal so why would he blame the Director. I would understand if the Director were still at large, but he's dead. Why would the councillor be angry? Wouldnt he be more angry at the man responsible for his incarceration, which would be the Chairman?  I think it's possible that he is merely waiting for the opportunity to join Carolina and Wash since genocide seems a bit much for him.  Or perhaps he is merely trying to survive his current situation."
roosterteeth,3dvoaz,blueturtle444,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:48:36 2015 UTC,what wrong info are you referring to?
roosterteeth,3dvoaz,danielr1341,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:16:05 2015 UTC,"He mentions Washington refuses Ai access to his head.   This however is wrong since Wash does this in Reconstruction. It's possible that the councillor didn't realise this but I think that's unlikely. He's a smart man , he would have figured it out."
roosterteeth,3dvoaz,NCommander,3,Sun Jul 19 23:30:56 2015 UTC,"It's never clear that Washington implants Alpha-Church. We clearly see Washington have Delta in his armor, but not in his head. Given Epsilon going mad in his head the first time left Wash pretty unhinged, you'd think the destruction of Alpha would have killed him.  My theory is that Wash simply had Alpha on his armors storage unit, and not implanted like we see with South Dakota/Delta, or Carolina/Epsilon.  EDIT: Scratch that, just rewatching the finale of reconstruction. Alpha specifically states that Wash has some pretty dark things in his head, and Wash says he lost his job which had ""great mental health coverage"". Think you spotted a continuity glitch."
roosterteeth,3dvoaz,LrFriday,2,Mon Jul 20 00:01:50 2015 UTC,"Not really. The Counselor says that Wash refuses access but Church as a full AI, accessed it on his own accord. Wash didn't give him permission."
roosterteeth,3dvoaz,DarkPhoenixMishima,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:12:53 2015 UTC,"Well considering Wash was aware of Church's presence, not to mention the Red and Blues knowing that Church's body was empty, would mean that Wash knew Church/Alpha was in his head. Whether this was part of the plan or if Church made himself known prior to the meet-up with the Meta is debatable.  Plus we've got to take into account the way Church moves into bodies. The original AI were directly implanted into the Freelancer's heads, which seems to create a stronger link between the two which would explain how Maine could be influenced by Sigma as well as the onslaught of memories Wash experienced with Epsilon. Church is capable of moving from person to person, likely syncing up to their armor rather than the person.  Wash is likely against the implanting of an AI into his head but is fine if an AI is present within his armor since the two are still separate."

It has been a fucking roller coaster of emotion.  Now I'm just sad that I have to wait like everyone else.  Perfect timing though since this has just come out.  One question, though.  Did I miss something, or wasn't O'Malley just another name for Omega around the time he first went into Doc?  Yet it seems Doc somehow now has a split-personality of O'Malley?"
roosterteeth,3dvoaz,Gaffgaff123,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:18:13 2015 UTC,"O'Malley is just another name for Omega, but after all the AI were destroyed (season 6) the memory of Omega's rage stayed in Doc (and caboose a bit) as a split personality, thus housing a memory of O'Malley in Doc."
roosterteeth,3dvoaz,NCommander,0,Mon Jul 20 16:10:45 2015 UTC,If they're building towards making Locus the new Meta then I'm not gonna be happy. THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE!
roosterteeth,3dvoaz,DarkPhoenixMishima,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:38:27 2015 UTC,"If anything, they're building to Carolina becoming the next Meta. I got the very strong impression that only thing that has prevented history repeating is her attachment to Epsilon and the Reds vs Blues.  She's far closer to post-Sigma Maine in characterization than anyone else. If something happened to them, its pretty easier seeing her easily slipping into her personality from Season 10, and loosing herself in her quest for vengence."
roosterteeth,3dvoaz,CyKoToaster,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:22:48 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking the Meta suit might serve as closure for Wash and Carolina. The two still have some serious issues from Project Freelancer to work out and the Meta, next to Tex, is the center of those issues. They both got betrayed, left for dead and ultimately couldn't do shit for revenge, and these two have been pretty revenge driven."

Just bitter and angry at her situation and the amount of people relying on her who've died. If anything her reaction to her situation is closer to the normal one than Doyle's, who is able to let go of the last few years a lot better than most people would."

I love Terraria and this was nice to have playing in the background whilst i did construction in my Terraria world.  They don't even have to edit it as I enjoy listening to it like a kind of minipod cast.

Shit, I remember getting in to TotalBiscuit and Jesse Cox from their Terraria series (which, from what I remember, helped to majorly propel there careers on YouTube). Anyway, I think Joel and Adam make an excellent unedited and uncensored stream team. Who cares about doing the editing to make a ""video"" (Joel) just do it live an then upload the entire recording like you just did. I loved it, and I would watch the fuck out of Adam and Joel continue there adventures (or misadventures) in Terraria.  Also I think Joel was drunk; which just added to the humor in my eyes"

roosterteeth,3dz2re,GuyWithoutModem,7,Mon Jul 20 18:20:10 2015 UTC,"Making them text post would be a solution or, now that there's two sticky threads available one could be dedicated to post all the personal channel videos during the week.   I agree with you there. Now that people from RT have their own channels, it would be good to just have them all posted in a weekly stickied post. I don't really care about the subreddit being ""flooded"" with videos from RoosterTeeth and their employees and their tweets. People who want more of those sweet, sweet internet points can still be the first to post in the weekly RT Staff Video Thread (or whatever the fuck it will be called)."
roosterteeth,3dz2re,iAmMitten1,5,Mon Jul 20 18:43:47 2015 UTC,I agree. It's basically the reason the RT bot was implemented; because people would race to post the videos. Either making them text posts or adding a bot.
roosterteeth,3dz2re,CrackLawliet,2,Mon Jul 20 18:51:30 2015 UTC,"A stickied list would be so much nicer, good suggestion."
roosterteeth,3dz2re,Dan_Of_Time,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:19:35 2015 UTC,"In all fairness, I think most subreddits could benefit from a text-post only rule. Encourages actual commentary and discussion and only really affects people who actually used baconreader's browser and the like instead of just opening with chrome/whatever apple has/IE on windows phone.  Gets rid of pretty much all (accusations of) ""karma whoring"", encourages people to take their time and actually say something when they spam a link, and tends to not affect bots at all since the various twitter bots are smart enough to parse a text post or a link post.  Also: If you at all care about getting minus magic internet points (downvoted), get off reddit. No matter where you go people are going to use that to disagree, and it is best to just ignore it."
roosterteeth,3dz2re,Gundato,0,Mon Jul 20 22:22:30 2015 UTC,"First off, I almost never see tweets posted that aren't at least somewhat funny, interesting, or related to RT projects, and the rare times they pop up, they're downvoted immediately. Second, you seem to be as obsessed with karma whores as the whores are with karma; who cares, man? They're worthless Internet points. You know why I post a lot of sponsor videos? Because I'm going to enjoy them and I want other sponsors to be able to enjoy them ASAP; whether karma comes from it or not couldn't matter less. Third, insulting people who downvote you isn't productive, especially if you're insulting others to begin with.  It's not that I inherently disagree with your idea, but you have to take into account how you say something, not just what you say (unfortunately, I often forget this myself)."
roosterteeth,3dz2re,Kicking222,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:22:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, the majority are as you said funny or interesting but there's also like i said, unrelated to RT and a lot of them get to the frontpage.

roosterteeth,3dst5a,GiverOfTheKarma,25,Sun Jul 19 04:58:25 2015 UTC,In the arc he sided with The Avengers because of personal issues surrounding the Phoenix force.   Also because he hates Scott Summers.
