And they don't even mention that spotify, for example, has plenty of options for music discovery, they just don't shove them right on your face like AM.   For me, the app has to work and work well.

Not only have I turned off the “Music Available Offline” toggle, but I’ve tried all sorts of different approaches that only leave me with the impression that it’s all just terribly random.  As a music discovery service, Apple Music is top notch. Not only does it churn out solid suggestions, but it’s also engaging and fun to explore. But that perk is lessened dramatically when there’s no workable way to consistently save songs for later listening.

trueapplemusic,3bzysy,7thton,3,Fri Jul 3 14:58:34 2015 UTC,"I agree about the community around listening. That is what is missing from satellite radio (because they are so many stations and so few people subscribe), podcasts (because they are prerecorded), and of course listening to one's own collection of music.   It's also the same thing that has happened with television. There are so many channels that it's rare you'll be watching the same thing as all of your friends. Then throw in the ability to DVR or watch a different feed, and the chances are even slimmer.   All of that is to say that there is something interesting and alluring about Beats 1 in that lots of people are listening. It's the one live station offered on Apple Music. It's new, so lots of people are tuning in. The service itself and its hosts are active on social media. There is a sense of community.  And what's even more interesting is that they are eschewing local content (the backbone of most radio stations) and are actually connecting people globally. That's pretty powerful.   I will say that there have been many songs they have played that I haven't enjoyed. And while I enjoy some hip hop, the New York hip hop show is not enjoyable for me. The host talks over the tunes, raps along, and someone keeps saying ""Beats 1."" It's cool, and I appreciate what he's doing, but it's not my bag."

trueapplemusic,3bzysy,branmuffinzed,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:34:28 2015 UTC,"Zane Lowe and the rest of the DJs on Beats 1 reminded me of how my musical tastes had narrowed and how much I missed the voice of a passionate music connoisseur recommending a new song. That’s what Nine Inch Nails frontman and Beats co-founder Trent Reznor had in mind when he advocated for creating a live global radio offering as part of the rebooted Apple Music app.  “In today’s streaming, all-access world, sometimes it feels nice to know that there are other people out there and feel like you’re tuned into something that communally other people are listening to,” Reznor told Rolling Stone. With Beats 1, he said, he is trying to approximate “when radio was good — which maybe it never was — but in my mind, there was a time when it seemed better than it currently is.”"
trueapplemusic,3bzzhw,LawrenceOfTheLabia,5,Fri Jul 3 15:04:22 2015 UTC,I was able to fix my issues with album art/wrong music matches by following the instructions in this video. http://youtu.be/pSj2B7QAh0U  Basically you change the artist name to something random like frtgrthtrhrth and then upload. Once the upload finishes you fix the metadata locally with iTunes or whatever program you wish and it keeps the right music and art and updates the artist.
trueapplemusic,3bzzhw,BrianEDenton,2,Fri Jul 3 17:53:11 2015 UTC,"No fix but searching for music by classical composers is difficult. Apple Music lists classical music largely by either conductor or performing ensemble. I'd like to search ""Bartók"" and have it bring up all music written by that composer."
trueapplemusic,3bzzhw,dharmabum81,2,Tue Jul 7 18:56:42 2015 UTC,Probably about 30% of my music library transferred over from Beats and NONE of my playlists were sent over. Any way to fix this??

In our own quick-and-dirty testing, my colleague Dan Tynan used the bandwidth gauge built into iOS (Settings > Cellular) to see how much data an hour of Apple Music streaming to his iPhone 6 via LTE would burn up. The answer: exactly 50 megabytes, for a bit rate of about 128 kbps.  I found other solid clues on Reddit. There, one user, xavier86, identified support for 64 kbps, 128 kbps and 256 kbps streams in an Apple Music streaming file’s metadata. Another, HeroPiggy95, located distinct 64, 128 and 256 kbps streams that played in non-Apple apps, including the Chrome browser on an Android tablet I tried."

If you simply click on the “Beats 1” art at the top of the “Radio” tab, you’ll be presented with a schedule of the upcoming shows over the next several hours.

If you can, try adding an album at a time (using the ""Add to iCloud Music Library"" option) and see what it does.  If you have a large library, it's not practical to add everything this way, but you can select a large portion and see what gets added successfully, and what fails. For me, it was songs I purchased with my old Apple ID, but you might have something else going on that's choking Match."

trueapplemusic,3br39m,7thton,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:48:05 2015 UTC,"I’ll be honest, I didn’t expect much from Apple Music. I was not only pleasantly surprised when I started using it, I’m downright impressed.  Many of the problems I had before with iTunes Radio are completely gone. Selecting genres of music or even something like “70s Rock Hits” or “80s Metal” gives you exactly what you want—great music.  With the integration of Beats, you also get curated playlists and the ability to stream artists’ music, if you become a member of Apple Music. The selection went from not having much to choose from with iTunes Radio, to having so much great content from playlists and radio stations that I had to start saving them all so I could listen to them later."
