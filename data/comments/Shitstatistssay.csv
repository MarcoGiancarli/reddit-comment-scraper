How about a church wedding—or a civil union—between a consenting mother and her adult son? And so on—there are innumerable outlandish examples that make it plain that government would have to at least set the outside parameters of marriage, even if it wasn't directly sanctioning them.   Maybe I'm just a shitlord but without more details, I don't see anything implicitly wrong with these two examples.

Cato Institute's Jason Kuznicki notes that marriage, properly understood, is a negative, pre-political right that in the liberal understanding of things the government doesn't grant, it guarantees. It makes as much sense, therefore, to abolish marriage in the name of unshackling it from the government's clutches as it would to, say, abolish property rights to ""free"" them from the government.

I don't believe in privatizing marriage in the sense that those two words together sounds like a marketing scheme.

There can be no tolerance toward democrats and communists in a libertarian social order. They will have to be physically separated and expelled from society. Likewise, in a covenant founded for the purpose of protecting family and kin, there can be no tolerance toward those habitually promoting lifestyles incompatible with this goal.

The creation and perpetuation of institutions of this kind has concentrated benefits and dispersed costs, meaning the market tends to overproduce that type of institution even according to the values of the very people whose decisions led to that outcome. Wage labor and excessive concentrations of wealth can therefore be considered negative externalities not unlike air pollution."

TIL business owners don't care if the planet they live on is destroyed.   Socialism can greatly decrease the number of businesses that harm the natural environment.   Haha, ain't that the truth. Especially the first 8 words.  You know what the sad thing about this line of thinking is? When you look at how people actually vote in elections, economic and business growth is a top priority, if not #1. Just look at how problematic or otherwise unpopular leaders can be reelected so long as economic growth is strong, e.g. Hugo Chavez, maybe David Cameron, Recep Erdogan. The first example is probably the saddest, because it shows even socialists were okay with running their country on oil profits so long as they had more money.

Well I ask you this: what value does any of that if climate change has turned the planet into a post-apocalyptic wasteland?  This ""observation"" treats the owners of large businesses like their only interest is money, without considering their other interests, or why they might like money. Sure, some businesses act against climate-reducing interests, but that's because they believe their plans, whether malicious or not, will not result in catastrophic environmental damage. (Feel free to dispute the wisdom of that judgement.)  Government regulation is not the only way to affect change. Government industries contribute a much smaller portion of CO2 emissions than other sources, and you can convince other people to voluntarily change their ways with the same evidence that has compelled you. These people not only vote, but buy products. Are you more inclined to buy products that you consider eco-friendly? you're not alone.  More broadly speaking, solving the major environment challenges ahead will involve doing more with less, and not just doing less.

Sure, some businesses act against climate-reducing interests, but that's because they believe their plans, whether malicious or not, will not result in catastrophic environmental damage.

You might be able to determine whether or not a product is environmentally friendly by googling it, but you can't expect people to google every product they buy.   from industries that will work better with less regulation.

Nevermind the fact that these same corporations use their wealth and power to lobby the government in their favour.

Congratulations, your open borders will have turned the US into Greece.   Remember, Hoppe argues sometimes in order to preserve liberty and a free market, people will have to be physically removed. That's why libertarians should be SUPPORTING mass deportation of illegals, because all they'll do is buy into welfare culture and the whole ""gibs me dat"" attitude that is poisoning the culture already. Round them up, put them on a bus back to Mexico. If that's too much spending, build a giant fucking catapult and launch their asses back over the border.

When you have open borders, all it does is attract the most shit-tier people possible who are going to flock to your country and ruin everything. You get situations like Rotherham where the government will actively prevent you from doing something about gangs of child-rapists because it would infringe on the freedom of immigrants, even if they're the ones who showed up and started raping everyone. If you have open borders, all that'll happen is that you get a bunch of absolutely awful people who will contribute nothing positive to your society at large.   It's much better to have a strict limit on who can come in, so that you'll maintain a more homogenous (and thus more free) society as well as making sure that you're not getting the worst kinds of people roaming your streets and raping your children."

I've come across this so many times now it barely phases me, but ""typical CEO pay"" in in 2015 is about 180,000/year.   The figure they're using is (usually) fortune 500 company CEO's, and if you know anything about statistics that is a non-representative sample. Would we purpusefully find a group of 500 students at Harvard, do a study, and then apply those results to the ""average"" college student? no, never...doesn't make any sense.  This CEO pay comparison makes about as much sense. ""typical"" CEO pay to ""typical"" worker pay is a ratio of about 7-1, not the one sided BS you hear about 300 or even 500-1.   Oh well.  Also, those other markets are HIGHLY regulated, to the point that you can't even buy (sort of) health insurance across state lines during most of that time period, thus reducing competition among health insurance providers and reducing quality to both consumers and producers.   I think one of the federal reserve banks just did a study showing that government subsidies to education are a large part of the reason for tuition inflation over the past few decades. Also, the economic payoff to getting a degree is still much higher than the cost in most cases and thus the increases in cost to tuition are (partially) an accurate reflection of this benefit. In other words, even under ideal conditions, the price would probably have went up anyways given the payoff/demand aspects.   Counterarguments? ""derp capitalism"""

""Reagan's pro-capitalist agenda""   ...apparently included increased taxes and more government programs.   ""trickle-down"" economics   ...has never existed outside of populist rhetoric, bailouts and subsidies.   Meteoric rises in cost of health care   Last I checked, Medicare and Medicaid were signed into law fifteen years before Reagan entered the White House for his first term, and that's what made healthcare prices start skyrocketing at twice the rate of inflation.  Additionally, the government had already been creating monopolies and oligopolies in the field long before that.   Cost of housing   I guess despite long since being out of office by then, Reagan somehow forced Greenspan to slash the interest rate to 1%, encouraging malinvestment and creating a massive bubble?   Food   I guess the ever-expanding list of byzantine FDA regulations has absolutely nothing to do with this?   College tuition   Like with healthcare, you can thank legislation passed long before Reagan entered office for this.  The Higher Education Act of 1965 is what started the college bubble which has driven up the price of tuition, since federal subsidies give schools no incentive to lower their asking price.

Shitstatistssay,3dqu2z,virgule,6,Sun Jul 19 00:44:18 2015 UTC,"This seam to raise a tangent related to the Social Contract. For the layman, the theory of the social contract is intended as a way of establishing the state's authority. The short version is that the people owe the state a duty of allegiance and a duty to pay taxes in exchange for certain goods and services (such as infrastructure and protection). In other words, you must pay your taxes because you use the roads.  The courts repeatedly decided, and upheld, that the state's have no duty to protect individual citizens; only the ""general population"" or the ""society at large"". The courts worried that the recognition of a duty to protect individuals, 'would effectively bring the business of government to a halt' and 'dispatch a new generation of litigants to the courthouses over grievances real and imagined'. (see 444 A.2d. 1, D.C. Ct. of Ap., 1981. also: Hartzler v. City of San Jose, 46 Cal.App. 3d 6 (1975) and DeShaney vWinnebago County Department of Social services, 489 U.S. 189 (1989). Imagine that! They know if they were to uphold their half of the deal, their whole thing would grind to a halt and crumble.  What that effectively mean, is that the state explicitly affirmed, and re-afirmed, that it does not owe a duty to protect individuals. From that, it is logical to infer that the individual does not owe anything to the state because the obligations are not reciprocal.   Remember, the social contract theory is meant to explain why individuals are obligated to pay and obey the state. If the contract holds only between the state and the ""society at large"", then perhaps the ""public at large"" owe something to the state, but no individual does. If, on the other hand, the contract holds between the state and the individual, then the state must owe something to the individual.   They can't have it both, guys. they cannot claim that the individual owe something to the state while maintaining the state owes nothing back.   I heard Obama studied the constitution and stuff a great deal. I'm sure he knows exactly what I am talking about."

It's by choosing to stay on that landlord's property – despite having the ability to leave, and while understanding the restrictions staying entails – that indicates a person's agreeing to that landlord's terms.  If your State made emigration illegal, you could make a strong case for why you think it an oppressive institution, but given that all people are taught how their governments work from a young age and choose to stay with them anyway pokes a few holes in your trying to declare them illegitimate while simultaneously supporting the existence of private institutions that do the exact same thing."

You don't have to defend corporations because they exist in a market. You don't have to support the American healthcare system because it's not fully socialized.   Medical care isn't that expensive. Far from it. Read up on mutual aid societies. People, even the poor, well, especially the poor could get affordable care:    Today, we are constantly being told, the United States faces a health care crisis. Medical costs are too high, and health insurance is out of reach of the poor. The cause of this crisis is never made very clear, but the cure is obvious to nearly everybody: government must step in to solve the problem.  Eighty years ago, Americans were also told that their nation was facing a health care crisis. Then, however, the complaint was that medical costs were too low, and that health insurance was too accessible. But in that era, too, government stepped forward to solve the problem. And boy, did it solve it!  In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, one of the primary sources of health care and health insurance for the working poor in Britain, Australia, and the United States was the fraternal society. Fraternal societies (called ""friendly societies"" in Britain and Australia) were voluntary mutual-aid associations. Their descendants survive among us today in the form of the Shriners, Elks, Masons, and similar organizations, but these no longer play the central role in American life they formerly did. As recently as 1920, over one-quarter of all adult Americans were members of fraternal societies. (The figure was still higher in Britain and Australia.) Fraternal societies were particularly popular among blacks and immigrants. (Indeed, Teddy Roosevelt's famous attack on ""hyphenated Americans"" was motivated in part by hostility to the immigrants' fraternal societies; he and other Progressives sought to ""Americanize"" immigrants by making them dependent for support on the democratic state, rather than on their own independent ethnic communities.)  The principle behind the fraternal societies was simple. A group of working-class people would form an association (or join a local branch, or ""lodge,"" of an existing association) and pay monthly fees into the association's treasury; individual members would then be able to draw on the pooled resources in time of need. The fraternal societies thus operated as a form of self-help insurance company.  Turn-of-the-century America offered a dizzying array of fraternal societies to choose from. Some catered to a particular ethnic or religious group; others did not. Many offered entertainment and social life to their members, or engaged in community service. Some ""fraternal"" societies were run entirely by and for women. The kinds of services from which members could choose often varied as well, though the most commonly offered were life insurance, disability insurance, and ""lodge practice.""  ""Lodge practice"" refers to an arrangement, reminiscent of today's HMOs, whereby a particular society or lodge would contract with a doctor to provide medical care to its members. The doctor received a regular salary on a retainer basis, rather than charging per item; members would pay a yearly fee and then call on the doctor's services as needed. If medical services were found unsatisfactory, the doctor would be penalized, and the contract might not be renewed. Lodge members reportedly enjoyed the degree of customer control this system afforded them. And the tendency to overuse the physician's services was kept in check by the fraternal society's own ""self-policing""; lodge members who wanted to avoid future increases in premiums were motivated to make sure that their fellow members were not abusing the system.  Most remarkable was the low cost at which these medical services were provided. At the turn of the century, the average cost of ""lodge practice"" to an individual member was between one and two dollars a year. A day's wage would pay for a year's worth of medical care. By contrast, the average cost of medical service on the regular market was between one and two dollars per visit. Yet licensed physicians, particularly those who did not come from ""big name"" medical schools, competed vigorously for lodge contracts, perhaps because of the security they offered; and this competition continued to keep costs low.  The response of the medical establishment, both in America and in Britain, was one of outrage; the institution of lodge practice was denounced in harsh language and apocalyptic tones. Such low fees, many doctors charged, were bankrupting the medical profession. Moreover, many saw it as a blow to the dignity of the profession that trained physicians should be eagerly bidding for the chance to serve as the hirelings of lower-class tradesmen. It was particularly detestable that such uneducated and socially inferior people should be permitted to set fees for the physicians' services, or to sit in judgment on professionals to determine whether their services had been satisfactory. The government, they demanded, must do something.  And so it did. In Britain, the state put an end to the ""evil"" of lodge practice by bringing health care under political control. Physicians' fees would now be determined by panels of trained professionals (i.e., the physicians themselves) rather than by ignorant patients. State-financed medical care edged out lodge practice; those who were being forced to pay taxes for ""free"" health care whether they wanted it or not had little incentive to pay extra for health care through the fraternal societies, rather than using the government care they had already paid for.  In America, it took longer for the nation's health care system to be socialized, so the medical establishment had to achieve its ends more indirectly; but the essential result was the same. Medical societies like the AMA imposed sanctions on doctors who dared to sign lodge practice contracts. This might have been less effective if such medical societies had not had access to government power; but in fact, thanks to governmental grants of privilege, they controlled the medical licensure procedure, thus ensuring that those in their disfavor would be denied the right to practice medicine.  Such licensure laws also offered the medical establishment a less overt way of combating lodge practice. It was during this period that the AMA made the requirements for medical licensure far more strict than they had previously been. Their reason, they claimed, was to raise the quality of medical care. But the result was that the number of physicians fell, competition dwindled, and medical fees rose; the vast pool of physicians bidding for lodge practice contracts had been abolished. As with any market good, artifical restrictions on supply created higher prices — a particular hardship for the working-class members of fraternal societies.  The final death blow to lodge practice was struck by the fraternal societies themselves. The National Fraternal Congress — attempting, like the AMA, to reap the benefits of cartelization — lobbied for laws decreeing a legal minimum on the rates fraternal societies could charge. Unfortunately for the lobbyists, the lobbying effort was successful; the unintended consequence was that the minimum rates laws made the services of fraternal societies no longer competitive. Thus the National Fraternal Congress' lobbying efforts, rather than creating a formidable mutual-aid cartel, simply destroyed the fraternal societies' market niche — and with it the opportunity for low-cost health care for the working poor.  Why do we have a crisis in health care costs today? Because government ""solved"" the last one."

Shitstatistssay,3dojan,Meatsim1,2,Sat Jul 18 00:35:48 2015 UTC,"The bill is Medi-Cal, who expanded Medicaid and has one of the most encompassing social network you can find in the states.  His income is one that his government, both state and federal, deemed high enough to get insurance.  Rather than get health insurance, he chose other more short-term things.  Then he got bit by a venomous snape and that iWatch didn't seem like a great idea anymore."
Shitstatistssay,3dojan,balorina,2,Sat Jul 18 00:48:24 2015 UTC,"Well it says ""applied"" to Medi-Cal or county medical services, not that he is enrolled in either of them.  Now doing some quick googling it seems that California is one of the states that took medicaid expansion money from the Feds as part of Obamacare and has its own health insurance exchange.  This should mean that this individual would have been able to purchase some sort of plan off the exchange and/or be eligible for medicaid.  I'm assuming if he had medicaid and/or an insurance plan some of this bill, though not all of it, would be covered by those so perhaps you're right."

Alcohol consumption by itself is not a positive, people desire some of the mind altering effects of it, but it also imposes negative effects on the rest of society through both its medical impacts and social disorder due to excessive consumption. It's in our interests there for to attempt to move people onto something else that has lower negative effects but still has the positive effects that people want from alcohol. Taxing alcohol would be one factor that could be used as a push effect, although by itself would not be effective since you need another alternative substance to move people to. It won't also help solve all of the issues, most of the impact would be on ""lifestyle"" drinkers who consume small quantities regularly rather then binge drinkers or those who are addicted, but funds raised from the taxation can be used to help fund other campaigns/programs to solve those issues.

What I was trying to say is that people consume alcohol because it gives them a number of positive effects, or because its a social activity. They don't do it because they like having a hangover, or in the case of excess drinking vomiting, to just name two short term effects, once you look at the long term effects of alcohol such as liver damage things do seem a bit bleaker. There are other chemicals out there that provide similar positive effects to alcohol, but different or no negative effects, and those could produce less harm to society in general if they were used instead of alcohol, but they are not because of social inertia. Alcohol consumption by itself is not positive, some of its effects are, and its in our interests as both individuals and as society as a whole to move away from alcohol to other substances that have similar positives but less negatives now we are able to do so."

Do your job, and admit that maybe you made a mistake in your career choice.    Where would all of the STEM people be without teachers anyway?   Muh roads teachuhs!   Something has to give. The comments on this thread indicate many of you feel that people like me deserve this, that I could have avoided it by choosing a different career track.   You're right. You could have avoided it by choosing a different career track. Why is that so hard for you to admit? I think I know why....   I went into the job because I like language, I like students, I like to help people learn, and I saw a way I could help be part of improving the education system.    Yeah... You have no fucking self respect and make all these secret deals in your mind with Big Daddy Government and society. You think that all your sacrifice and bowing to the altar of the greater good is going to reward you and make your life better. Well guess what? The the world doesn't owe you shit just because you have some whack ass version of entitlement. Grow a pair, and admit you made a mistake. Get some self reliance, and better locus of control and see that your actions are 100% in YOUR control and that you are fully capable of making good OR bad things come of that.   Speaking of Khan Academy... I used to think I was shit at math and that was probably because I listened to everyone and let society decide my future. I said fuck that, used khan academy and learned Calculus for the first time! All because I stopped trying to blame everyone else for my lack of ability.    Grow up.   Speaking as someone from Ontario, home of the 2nd mafia known as the Teachers Union, I can assure you that it is YOU that needs to grow up. Either way, your sense of entitlement is outrageous, but ultimately a milder version of something I see all the time."

Shitstatistssay,3ddizl,Muffinator4,7,Thu Jul 16 14:52:28 2015 UTC,"Ok, let's accept your premise that they work longer hours. Now, let's do some basic math. Here is a pdf showing the number of days per school year from the Education Commission of the States. The average is 180 days for the US totaling 900-1,000 hours of learning.Even taking the high number of 1,000 hours per year, that means the average student is spending 5.55 hours per day being taught.   Ok, but you say teachers are working harder and more hours. Let's give them an 8 hour workday for each of those 180 days for a total of 1,440 hours worked in that period. At this point, you might be saying that total looks decidedly lower than what the average person works and you'd be right. The average American works around 1,770 hours per year with many working more. This will be more anecdotal but it isn't hard to find someone in a salaried position that regularly puts in 50 hours per week. but still, 330 more hours per year and that's giving teachers 2.45 hours more per day.   What would teachers need to do to make up that gap? they'd have to work an extra 1.8 hours per day or a total of 4.25 hours every single day to be on par with your average worker in the US. And even then, they are still better compensated, the average salary for a high school teacher is $55,360 in 2013 and yet the median household income is only $50,502 with an average household income of $69,821. Congrats, your average teacher makes enough money to almost equal the average household income of the United States while working 330 hours fewer than other workers.  TLDR: shut the fuck up about teachers being underpaid and overworked."
Shitstatistssay,3ddizl,SarcasticPanda,-5,Thu Jul 16 15:56:49 2015 UTC,"Jesus H. Christ.   Ok, but you say teachers are working harder and more hours. Let's give them an 8 hour workday for each of those 180 days   Why would we do that when we know that they work 50 hours per week during the school year? So right off the bat you're entering this analysis with two false assumptions. The first is that teachers only work an 8 hour work day. The second is that they are working only 180 days (school days). If teachers average 50 hour work weeks during the school year, and there are 5 school days to a week, then it stands to reason we can give them 10 hours credit per school day (obviously some of those hours are on weekends, but those hours still count).  They also work extra days that aren't ""school days"" usually at the end and beginning of the semesters, but also during the year for conferences/parent teacher meetings/etc. You arrive at the number 1440 by both lowering the hours worked per day and the days worked.  But hey, we'll hang on to the 180 days. That means 10 hour days for 1800 hours per year.   The average American works around 1,770 hours per year with many working more.   So we already established that you're 1440 hours worked is baseless, and adjusted it to 1800 hours per year. In short, teachers work more during the school year than the average worker does year round. Furthermore, you're attempting to compare what the average American does versus what the average teacher does only in their teaching position. This is an unfair comparison for two reasons. One, the hours are cramped into a shorter period of time leading to more stress, hardship, and leisure time. Two, it doesn't take into account what teachers do for the summer months (aka end of June to the end of August, or beginning of September). Many of them work. Summer school, bartending, camp... you know... summer jobs. Even if they stayed on the beach all summer, they would be working more hours than the average worker does all year, but many don't do that.   This will be more anecdotal but it isn't hard to find someone in a salaried position that regularly puts in 50 hours per week.   True. Harder task: find me a salaried worker who puts 50 hours per week and makes the same amount as a teacher if they've been in their profession for the same amount of time. Teachers have an average starting salary of 30,377 (same source as earlier).   And even then, they are still better compensated, the average salary for a high school teacher is $55,360 in 2013 and yet the median household income is only $50,502 with an average household income of $69,821. Congrats, your average teacher makes enough money to almost equal the average household income of the United States while working 330 hours fewer than other workers.   Let's look at average household income, that includes households with 1 parent, minimum wage workers, unemployed people compared to full time professional workers who require a college degree. While working 30 hours more, per year, in a shorter amount of time.  TL;DR shut the fuck up about teacher being overpaid and underworked."
Shitstatistssay,3ddizl,NRA4eva,7,Wed Jul 15 19:26:04 2015 UTC,"Why would we do that when we know that they work 50 hours per week during the school year? So right off the bat you're entering this analysis with two false assumptions.    Ahh, sourcing the NEA, next time try an unbiased source for your hours worked. Next we'll argue that the oil & gas industry is overregulated and cite exxonmobil.com and bp.com or we could argue that Americans all deserve a raise and cite Bernie Sanders, glory be to Bernie!   The first is that teachers only work an 8 hour work day. The second is that they are working only 180 days (school days). If teachers average 50 hour work weeks during the school year, and there are 5 school days to a week, then it stands to reason we can give them 10 hours credit per school day (obviously some of those hours are on weekends, but those hours still count).   Actually, I started with the assumption they were working a similar amount of time to the students actually learning, 5.5 hours. Of course, I should take off half an hour since they all get a lunch. Oh, and another 1.5 hours since teachers get a free period.    So we already established that you're 1440 hours worked is baseless, and adjusted it to 1800 hours per year.    Did you think about the consequences of this? Ok, fine, let's give you that they work 1800 hours per year, they still make more than the median household income and slightly below the average household income, meaning they've got a pretty sweet gig, not to mention they get 3 months off, sweet benefits and job security that the private sector only wishes it could have. All for the cost of working 30 more hours per year.   Furthermore, you're attempting to compare what the average American does versus what the average teacher does only in their teaching position. This is an unfair comparison for two reasons. One, the hours are cramped into a shorter period of time leading to more stress, hardship, and leisure time. Find me professional workers who ONLY do one job.    I work as a credit analyst, you think my entire day is just reading financial statements? I wish it was just that. That's a part of my job, so is keeping up to date on industry news, training programs, covering for other employees, other various tasks that come up that have to be done.    Two, it doesn't take into account what teachers do for the summer months (aka end of June to the end of August, or beginning of September). Many of them work. Summer school, bartending, camp... you know... summer jobs.   And they do these jobs as slaves? They aren't paid? Assuming $10 per hour and 28 hours per week for 3 months they'll bring in an extra 3.3k per year.   So they're working summer jobs to make ends meet while making in the mid 50s, seems like they suck at budgeting. Somehow when I was making sub 30k I managed to not have to take a second job. I don't want someone teaching my kid who can't figure out a budget.   Harder task: find me a salaried worker who puts 50 hours per week and makes the same amount as a teacher if they've been in their profession for the same amount of time. Teachers have an average starting salary of 30,377    Sorry to break this to you, but teaching isn't that hard of a profession. If so many people can go to school and get their teaching degree, it's not that hard. Basic economics here but salaries are determined by a few factors: the unpleasantness of the job (be honest, it's a sweet job), the specialized skills required (ooh a 4 year degree in teaching, pretty exclusive shit right there) and the number of people willing and able to do the job (hint: here's the big limiting factor of teachers' salaries).   Not to mention we spend $12k per student as a nation. And what do we get for that ridiculous amount of money? Average, middle of the pack students. We top the list on spending but perform poorly, maybe the problem is the teachers? Teachers make an average of over 50k per year, putting them solidly middle-class, then have shittily performing students and then you have the unmitigated gall to tell me we need to spend more money? Fuck you. If I got a fat raise and performed poorly and then asked my manager for more money, I'd be laughed out of my job but teachers are different, teachers are special. No, you're really not, grow the fuck up. You want to be paid like rock stars, perform like rock stars."

What I don't like about today's version of a social contract is that it keeps getting re-written to say that your rights trump mine.   Some fixes were good.  The Declaration of Independence included the social contract in the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  This used to mean that I can't take away your life, your liberty, or prevent you from pursuing happiness.  We screwed up in the Constitution when we told women they couldn't vote and we told blacks they couldn't have liberty. The Constitution was wrong because it prevented inalienable rights to blacks and women. The fix was to give women the right to vote (equality) and blacks freedom (equality).  And everywhere we didn't give blacks equality has to be purged.  But nowadays, we're saying that your rights trump my rights.  The new social contract says that your inalienable right to life means I have to pay to keep you alive as long as you wish. Your right to pursue happiness means I have to provide you with money to be happy.  Unlike other contracts that can only be amended by agreement of all interested parties, or unlike a Constitution or federal law that can only be amended by elected representatives, the social contract can be amended by the will of the media.  I may hate FPTP election processes, but at least I can see the truck about to hit me.  Whoever is out there writing all over my social contract is invisible and their changes are not subject to appeal.   The thing is, we need to quit calling this a social contract.

The point is, government is quite capable of destroying society. The opposite can also be true: the absence of a government can be a net benefit.

But if you consider what will happen with even more socialism: The government will have even more power that they will offer to banks, corporations, unions, (everyone that wants power and has something to give in exchange).

We would have free banking then without a govt. controlled currency. If a bank starts acting bad then all it's customers will just switch bank and that bank will just go bankrupt (now customers doesn't switch banks when banks are bad because they know the govt guarantees their deposits). The banks would then probably also stay much smaller and local than today (it is the massive govt. bureaucracy that requires that a bank has to be big in order to be effective). And we would probably have no fractional reserve banking at all since the depositors wouldn't want the banks to lend out more money than they have (because that would risk their money).

Edit: After a little more pondering I think I need to make a minor change. The NAP and Voluntaryism exist at different levels, so they aren't the same thing by definition, but the real point is that the NAP is not the underlying principle of voluntaryism (for the reason that I gave).

No restrictions on immigration. Honestly, I had some social opinions that are rather conservative.

After years of studying public policy it impresses me how every time I see force being initiated there are always unintended consequences.  Sometimes they are very apparently like with the war on drugs.  Other times it's benefits that go unrealized due to the threat of violence by the state.    I realized I was a libertarian when as a democrat I debated my friend on gun control.  He destroyed me easily and I was shocked.  This motivated me to investigate my core beliefs more deeply and found the libertarian ideals were for me.  It wasn't until many years later when I became an-cap after I de-programmed myself and realized just how damaging things like public education were.

Also the depths that the horizontal drilling typically takes place at are well below most water tables.   Ok, so when I'm done with that drilling and I pump 50,000 gallons of waste onto my property and drive away...what happens?"

Shitstatistssay,3d061z,palindrome_emordnila,-2,Sun Jul 12 15:43:25 2015 UTC,Right...but they wouldn't if there was no regulation.  So the solution to the problems of no regulation....is regulation?
Shitstatistssay,3d061z,zxcv73,2,Sun Jul 12 15:48:42 2015 UTC,"Right...but they wouldn't if there was no regulation.   So there are regulations, and it isn't unregulated like Bill Nye said? WHAAATT?? Bill Nye can't be wrong!!"

Shitstatistssay,3d061z,PSYCHOTIC_COMMIE,2,Sun Jul 12 17:03:42 2015 UTC,If there is no useful recourse then they don't really have property being harmed.
Shitstatistssay,3d061z,meanwhile_in_SC,3,Sun Jul 12 17:08:45 2015 UTC,"Useful recourse would be a lawsuit but often the effects of untested chemicals is long term health changes that don't show up for decades or that follow former residents of a neighborhood.   It is notoriously hard to track down long term health changes from chemicals in the water or ground unless they are very severe and immediate.   By then the operation may have ceased and that makes proving causing even more difficult. You can say with almost complete certainty scientifically but that's not too hard to weasel out of with lawyers.   It's effectively like setting time bombs that may or may not go off for thirty years. Property and persons are harmed but the only useful recourse ion a situation like this, a lawsuit, isn't viable if the damage takes a decade to appear."

Because members of a community are totally incapable of saying ""hey we have some usable land that we could sell the fracking rights to in exchange for some value...""  And then hire (private) experts to ensure the fracking is done properly.  Nope, don't let people be responsible for their own communities and property.  We need regulations to free us from thought and responsibility!"

Shitstatistssay,3cz72u,newnym,3,Sun Jul 12 08:02:28 2015 UTC,Reading the article it annoyed me. We should be happy for the ecological cheat code that is oil after nature fucks us over for daring to thrive.  Is it sad that there is going to be a sixth mass extinction? Sure but as long as people want live first world lifestyles it's just not going to stop. No matter how many solar panels or wind farms are built. They're just not going to catch with the thousands of new jets and billions of new lifestock for the developing third world.   Humanity deserves to survive. And to do so in a more adverse world we need more resources then ever. Maybe we need more solar panels and synthetic meats. But to get there we need that magic hydrocarbon elixir.

Designs like the LFTR might have some hope with terrestrial's simplified design but I'm sure the state will find a way to regulate it to death to protect the uranium oxide fuel cycle that the nuclear industry runs off.

I'm sure I could do a whole lot of good if I was given the power to be the head of state for an entire nation; Alas, I was born a poor plebeian and had no subjects to give my wealth too; so I had no one to praise me for such a feat. Still, snarky humor aside, I wonder how long Britain intends to keep it's monarchy. Or for that matter, how long all those other countries intend to keep their aristocratic elite."

Shitstatistssay,3cxsj2,salacio,5,Sun Jul 12 02:06:55 2015 UTC,I suppose nobody told this guy about Marx's unhealthy obsession with calling his rival Ferdinand Lassalle a 'nigger jew'.   The fact that socialists are mostly white intellectuals doesn't mean that socialists are all racist misogynists. It's just that basing your ideology around a dude who knocked up his unpaid nanny while holding a seething hatred for jews is a really fucked up position to hold.
