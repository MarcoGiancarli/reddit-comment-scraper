Forex,3e6dcl,nvstrs,3,Wed Jul 22 08:27:01 2015 UTC,"While creating an account with FXStreet today I noticed that neither the registration page nor the login page use SSL during form submission, which means that users’ personal information—including their passwords—is sent in the clear. Intercepting this information is trivial for an attacker in many situations, for example when on a public wireless network such as at airports.  Even more worrying is that FXStreet places a length restriction on passwords, which means that they most likely store passwords in unencrypted form. If an attacker gains access to their database, he will immediately have access to the user names, email addresses, passwords and in some cases personal information of FXStreet’s users.  While the direct damage an attacker can do by accessing FXStreet accounts is probably limited (“What are they going to do, change my calendar settings?”), many people still reuse email addresses, user names and passwords across the web, making this a critical security flaw.  There is absolutely no excuse that would justify not using SSL to transmit sensitive information and not storing passwords in a secure manner. It’s not hard and it’s not expensive and it boggles my mind why a site like FXStreet wouldn’t bother to implement the most basic security measures.  I’ve reached out to them via Twitter, but I doubt I’ll receive a response from them through that channel.  TL;DR   Use a unique password that you don’t use anywhere else for your FXStreet account. Don’t visit the site using public networks. Complain to FXStreet about their total lack of basic security."

The best bet is watching the implied volatility charts for any given currency because that will show the market's best approximation about what will happen in the future. Even then it won't be perfect but it at least will be telling. Besides that you can logically come to a conclusion that the market will consolidate after large moves and before major news announcements for the most part.

Forex,3dzuvr,retlif,4,Mon Jul 20 21:38:49 2015 UTC,"Personally I would be inclined to keep building shorts on NZD.  No one knows exactly what all the participants are doing, but there is more happening than just a rate cut and there is a large carry trade likely to be unwinding even now aided by the fed raising rates.  Historically, NZDUSD has been much lower too, and there is much more room to fall.  Wasn't so long ago that NZDUSD was trading at 0.4.  It is roughly about 50% peak to trough in past 10 years.  Ditto for USD index, several commentators (Maudlin) believe that USD strength has much further to run, I'm not so sure, but they have been right so far.  Not that I don't expect chop, but I do expect it to be a directional chop lower over time with NZD.  Also had some strong words from the governor saying the currency was overpriced not too long ago."
Forex,3dzuvr,Tifosy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:14:16 2015 UTC,"i'd still recommend running short into the RBNZ, just wary of the market having gotten too doved up over this RBNZ.  we are getting murmurs that the currency has fallen too fast (PM was on the wires yesterday).    of  course i agree that unwind flows will persist, but i guess my main point was that keep some powder dry to take advantage of any potential rally.  it's always very tempting to get balls to the walls short when it's like this, which often ends up with you being at your max position size right at the bottom."
Forex,3dzuvr,Tifosy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:29:02 2015 UTC,I do actually have that problem of having larger positions on the turn.  I think the key is to let your positions grow before adding - I should take my own advice lol
Forex,3dzuvr,nate1357,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:01:41 2015 UTC,I'm honestly worried about this one. The speculative shorts have been piling in for months - I can't believe that there's too much capital left to keep shorting it (absolutely everyone is bearish). But the interest rates still favor NzdUsd longs - so if it starts going tits-up it's going to run stops like crazy because nobody wants to be stuck underwater against the carry. If they don't cut or if they make a comment about how fast it had dumped you could see this scenario play out in the coming months.    In the end I'm not going to be running anything longer than an intraday position until Wheeler injects some clarity.
Forex,3dzuvr,Tifosy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:12:57 2015 UTC,"I will be running shorts into this.  Positions are already on, downside is controlled because 2 of those positions are at break even.  Worried about it myself, but the trend is still lower.  Good point about the carry, it is still positive in NZD favor however I think as interest rates changes, and prices moves lower forces the hands of those who don't have the best entry price for their carry.  I guess it depends on how much leverage was propping up that carry in the first place, probably quite a lot.  NZDUSD is not just moving lower because of NZD weakness though.  Dollar strength across the market is weighing it down somewhat.  I'm never quite sure how to read extreme COT positioning.  Sometimes it looks works great and you look like a genius when you call a top lol, other times the speculative shorts just fizzle out in a sideways market and the price continues to plummet.  Truth be told is I have never found an edge by going against the main trend and technically that is what I rely on, fundies for me just have to paint a convincing story.  This thread is giving me the jitters, wish me luck Wednesday night.  I always hate seeing decent unrealized profit going up in smoke! lol"
Forex,3dzuvr,nate1357,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:09:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, having stops at breakeven certainly isn't a bad position to be in either way. Worst case you lost some time.     The only reason I even brought anything up about a possible countertrend move is that I took a look at the weekly chart and saw a decent amount of targets for longer term shorts from here on down another 3-4cents. So it just seems scary to chase it here over longer TFs.    Seems like were going to be in for a very slow summer though since every CB has laid out their plans pretty solidly and left little up to the market's interpretation."
Forex,3dzuvr,masudhossain,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:28:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'd watch the rhetoric around the pace of the fall carefully.  Like you say, it's one of those scenarios that every man and his dog is already short, and needs something unexpected (50bp cut for example) to actually trigger fresh momentum lower against the USD.  I squared up all my long USD possies yesterday and am preferring to be short via AUD.  Think we may have traced out the dip in AUDNZD now so much more comfortable being long AUDNZD rather than short NZDUSD"
