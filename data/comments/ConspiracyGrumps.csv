ConspiracyGrumps,3e3xbs,iwasannon,23,Tue Jul 21 19:48:34 2015 UTC,"I agree, I just feel bad about posts like this getting popular because Suzy seems like the kind of person who would go ""Arin! The internet said the other's were making fun of me, listen to this clip!"" and then the control would just get tighter. I mean, when the Etsy scandal blew up Arin's response said that Suzy came to him and said she wanted to stop because people didn't like her GG episodes, so it feels like she'll bring this kind of stuff up to ""their boss/my husband"".  I really like this series so far, it's funny, and the grumps are actually joking around a bit. I don't want them to feel like they can't joke around like this without getting in trouble though."
ConspiracyGrumps,3e3xbs,thegooblop,8,Tue Jul 21 21:24:12 2015 UTC,"In that respect, this might be a good thing for her as it's really innocent and could provide a stepping stone to being able to handle the ruthlessness of places like this subreddit - she obviously didn't grow into ""fame"" to the extent that the other grumps did, so it probably felt overwhelming to have thousands of people on the internet invading her privacy and harassing her for being dishonest in business (among other things), so she internalized it and was more sensitive to the topic because it brings that feeling back.   If we could avoid brigading her when stuff like this pops up, and just let it actually be a joke instead of going back and hating her for what she did or spouting theories of how she's a reverse-homewrecker, maybe she can adapt? How do you know if she's the type of person who would cry to Arin normally? I very much doubt that she's truly herself online - wouldn't you hide behind some kind of facade if you weren't given the opportunity to slowly adapt to internet harassment?  If I'm to be honest, Suzy did very well given her situation. Business and dishonesty are like bread and butter - she tried to uphold her (very) normal business practice, which unfortunately involved lying, but eventually fessed up. A lot of the fanbase, though, really doesn't seem to understand that she is a human just like everyone else and makes mistakes.  She went to Arin not because she's looking for her white knight to defend her against level-headed people, but because he's a well-respected person who can see the humanity behind all the grumps and can make a good attempt to mediate. Someone like Ross might not understand the severity of what Suzy felt after being harassed so much while she was still relatively new to the scene. Arin shares a bed with her - he's the one who knows what she felt. He should be the one to tell Ross to lighten up; not because Suzy is a damsel in distress, but because Arin has a well-established rapport with Ross.  Sorry for the rant, and of course this isn't based in fact, but I felt that an alternate opinion was in dire need."
ConspiracyGrumps,3e3xbs,L_Lawliet_AMA,7,Wed Jul 22 00:17:33 2015 UTC,"people on the internet invading her privacy and harassing her for being dishonest in business (among other things)   This part is wrong, it is NOT an invasion of privacy to check if a seller is selling real products. If I buy something, I have an absolute right to know if it's a bootleg or real. She lied and cheated people and got caught, that isn't harassment. People weren't asking underwear salesmen what underwear Suzy bought, they were trying to find what fake jewelry she bought since she very obviously could not be trusted to tell the truth.   How do you know if she's the type of person who would cry to Arin normally   Like I said in my post, Arin specifically told us she does this. He said she came to him to tell him how sad the internet was making her. Arin used this as an excuse to shame us and tell us we don't deserve his presence on the subreddit.    If I'm to be honest, Suzy did very well given her situation. Business and dishonesty are like bread and butter - she tried to uphold her (very) normal business practice, which unfortunately involved lying, but eventually fessed up.   Not really. If she told the truth after someone asked her it would be one thing, but she was caught and lied, and over a month later someone got 100% proof and she couldn't lie any more. Her business practice is NOT normal, if someone wanted to they could have easily brought her to court for this (she made thousands in profit by directly lying) , but she got lucky and nobody did. I don't run a business, but I sell a lot of stuff on Ebay and know that you can't lie about things. She didn't make simple mistakes, she flat out lied to us on purpose, and she admitted that in her apology post."
ConspiracyGrumps,3e3xbs,thegooblop,2,Wed Jul 22 00:33:18 2015 UTC,"To address your responses in order:    I did not assert that checking validity is an invasion of privacy. This is perfectly legitimate and positive. However, labeling her a terrible person for unethical business practice and proceeding to blame her for destroying friendships and manipulating GG members for personal gain is indeed an invasion of privacy. Her relationship with Arin is not our concern. Watching a YouTube channel and stalking their social media does not tell us the underlying nature of their relationship. They're a married couple. A few strongly worded posts on the internet does not give anything close to an understanding developed over years of intimate coexistence. Arin specifically said she did that, yes. This does not mean her nature is that of one who cannot handle any problems on her own. It says that she was overwhelmed by destructive criticism and needed support. Let's say it is the case, though - she can't handle any criticism. Is she not allowed to be a sensitive person? She asked if she should leave GG because she saw extreme negativity toward her and thought she was unsuccessful. Arin responded to the community in kind because he saw that very many people were acting out of line. Sure, it sucks that a small fraction of the community was actually flaming her, but he saw someone he cares about being hurt by people who were supposedly his fans acting irrationally. The practice was devious, yes. Is that abnormal in business? Your ad hominem argument does not show an understanding of normalcy in the world of profit-seekers; your assertion that you can't lie on places like eBay is naive. Here's an example: eBay does not protect vehicle transactions - someone can promise you a car, take your money, and give you nothing. Business has never been about being as honest as you can; it's about turning a profit. Many large, established companies, in fact, lie very obviously about their product, are called out on it, and keep doing it. Here's an example: ISPs. My provider promises me a 60 Mbps internet connection, but I get 10. I have 100% proof that they lie to me. Can I sue them? No, not realistically. Did they stop because I gave them 100% proof? Of course not."
ConspiracyGrumps,3e3xbs,L_Lawliet_AMA,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:16:30 2015 UTC,"I can sort of agree with this, but it doesn't have anything to do with the part of the post I quoted. The people who found out about the scams aren't really the same people who call Suzy a homewrecker or whatever. I'm talking about the fact that you worded it as doing those things FOR being dishonest in business (among other things) which isn't true. Trolls that latch onto a bandwagon don't represent the normal people. I wouldn't say anything the normal criticisms said were out of line or irrational. There are trolls, yes, but the post Arin and Suzy replied to was a post exposing fraud, not a troll.    Separately, on her Tumblr Suzy quoted people calling her unfunny and she pulled out the unneccesary ""sexism"" card and followed up by saying ""When was being funny a prerequisite?"". I think it's perfectly rational for someone to dislike a host on a comedy show that insists they don't have to be funny, because it's a rotating cast and if one of the members is admitting they don't come anywhere near the rest of the cast and shouldn't have to, something is wrong. If a newsanchor said ""When was being honest in the news a prerequisite?"" they would instantly be fired and replaced by someone that qualified for the job. Obviously a comedy show isn't as big a deal as a news show, but when a member of a comedic group insists the show doesn't require ""funny"" then that pisses the people that don't like that person off.    You asked me if that's abnormal in business, and there is a simple answer: YES! Just because people do shady shit doesn't mean it's ok for Suzy to blatently ignore the law. Right now she abuses her fans without doing too many illegal things (she changed outright lies to unprovable claims like ""museum quality"") and that's acceptable, even if it's a terrible thing to do to your fans.    You're flat out wrong about Ebay, there is no way you can purchase a vehicle and just not receive anything. Maybe Ebay won't fix it, but you can go to court and sue the person, especially if it's over something as big as a car.  Yes, you can sue your ISP if you have a contract stating you get 60 Mbps but have absolute proof you get 10 (you don't have definite proof of this, unless you have a machine or special router designed to track the exact amount of Mbps you're allowed to get). People HAVE sued over things like this before: http://www.scribd.com/doc/88715671/Verizon-Class-Action-Copy is one law suit against Verizon for your exact issue. This also ignores the fact that Mbps isn't a physical item, you can show one of the Chinese pieces of garbage Suzy sent you to a judge, but you can't show them your absolute Mbps easily.  It doesn't matter if you think the business world is some shady shithole where nobody is honest, that isn't how reality works. Companies lose money and even go bankrupt every single day because of illegal activities, the US legal system (The one Suzy falls under) would not look the other way if someone sued."
ConspiracyGrumps,3e3xbs,thegooblop,-1,Wed Jul 22 02:10:49 2015 UTC,"I don't want to continue the debate at this point, and I can see that where we disagree, we both have rational reasons. I just want to clear up what I'm trying to say about business because I didn't get the point across that I meant to:   1: I don't think the business world is a shady shithole. I want to point out that, just as in every facet of life, lots of people lie in business. Shady things happen inside and outside of business - it is normal. I didn't mean to say that every business scams every user, because they don't; however, lying and misleading customers happens regularly.   On the note of eBay, I used it as an example of people falling for bad business. It does happen and has happened (look up common eBay scams). You can sue the person, sure, but many people won't. If the vendor uses fake information and accounts, a 70 year old woman who saw a good deal on a car isn't going to hire a lawyer and go after them because she messed up.  For ISPs, I don't want to get into any details about my specific demographics or anything, but it's relatively easy to track bandwidth and quite a bit harder to work through the legal system. I could do it, sure, but it sucks that neither I nor most people are dissatisfied enough to go through the trouble.   In the end, my long-winded point was that Suzy messed up, but she didn't deserve the amount of hate and personal attacks that she received; she's a person just like you or me. I don't know about everyone else, but I'd prefer she be comfortable enough to be herself than being annoying and cringy because of vitriol.  Edit: Also want to apologize for miscommunicating. TL;DR was that bad business doesn't necessarily mean bad person"

ConspiracyGrumps,3e3xbs,SaikoGekido,13,Wed Jul 22 00:04:06 2015 UTC,"Suzy has an Etsy shop. She sells jewelry and bugs, usually around $100 each.    Someone found out Suzy bought cheap Chinese junk jewelry for $3 to $8, put a cheap silver chain on it and make over 1000% profit off of it. She caters to Grump fans, we know this because she gives free stickers of her own face (yes, Suzy stickers) with every purchase. People buying Jewelry don't want Suzy stickers, only Game Grumps/Suzy fans want those. She responded to this post saying the things she bought were real, and NOT imported. She said she bought things from local sellers, and handpicked items. Someone had 100% proof Suzy lied in step 2, they contacted multiple sellers who sell the cheap $3 items and the sellers confirmed Suzy bought them from her and had them shipped from other countries. Suzy straight up lied to us and said her stuff was real and locally bought and was caught lying again. Suzy responded and apologized, Arin took a mean tone and said we should feel ashamed for being mean to Suzy. Suzy said she absolutely uses REAL sterling silver chains, and is sorry for lying to us and cheating people out of money. Everyone on the main sub instantly forgave Suzy for lying to us the next day, and both Suzy and Arin got a ton of reddit gold and upvotes. Suzy got caught lying AGAIN, people who bought her stuff tested it and found out not even the silver chains are real, as anyone with eyes can see:   https://www.reddit.com/r/rantgrumps/comments/3c1vaa/suzys_etsy_expos%C3%A9_jewelry_part_4_fake_sterling/  It's worth mentioning she STILL sells $3 junk with a fake chain for $100+, she just doesn't directly lie on her Etsy page. She uses legally safe and worthless terms like ""Museum Quality"" instead of saying she buys all components locally and makes them by hand, which are lies she used to use. I don't know if the other posts exist anymore, they might have been deleted when /r/ventgrumps imploded. Anyone have a version of the older posts saved?"

ConspiracyGrumps,3e25s4,SuperSushiFighter,8,Tue Jul 21 14:51:19 2015 UTC,"I don't doubt that Suzy really cared about Jon, but I believe she saw Nicole as nothing more than filler for him. Her relationship with Arin was supposedly more ""real"" because they had met before his fame and fortune.   That actually makes sense to me. The thing is, I'm not sure on the reasons why Suzy would invest herself in someone else's relationship.  I mean, if Nicole started being asked about being on Grumps more and more, maybe and just maybe Suzy was getting jealous of something? I'm not exactly sure what. Holly seems to have no problems up to now being strongly associated with the Grumps. I'm not sure of the dynamics of the group to really tell if Suzy had any tell in Jon's relationship."

Ross and Jon are good friends, and Ross seems okay with Suzy. Same with Barry. Nobody seems to hold a grudge against Suzy or even mild animosity towards her.

ConspiracyGrumps,3dz0ch,Bsharpmajorgeneral,7,Tue Jul 21 05:00:54 2015 UTC,That happens with EVERY youtube channel
ConspiracyGrumps,3dz0ch,SpacePilots,6,Mon Jul 20 23:52:15 2015 UTC,"General rule is that your views on a relatively recent video should be about 10% of your subs, so, yeah, that's incredibly normal."
ConspiracyGrumps,3dz0ch,Crystal_Clods,3,Mon Jul 20 20:25:44 2015 UTC,"Most big youtuber's subscribers only account for a small fraction of their total views. I cant imagine it would be much different for the grumps.  When a person subscribes theres no guarantee that they will watch all or even any of the videos. plus, inactive subscribers add to the total count and who knows how many thousands there are"
ConspiracyGrumps,3dz0ch,poopycocacola,3,Mon Jul 20 18:21:11 2015 UTC,"Fairly. The older a video is, the more views it will accumulate, because more people will have time to view it. It's actually a relatively low number of people who will view every video on the day it's released. There are various reasons for this, such as people not viewing until the weekend, people not being interested in that particular piece of content at the time, and people who will only occasionally watch any video. Really, the views on any one video don't matter once you start getting up into the hundreds of thousands. With a letsplay channel like the Grumps, who produce at least 3 videos a day, everyday of the week, its hundreds of thousands to a million of views a week. If every video every week hit a quarter million views, that would be nearly six million views. It adds up, especially because the medium they work in is relatively low cost."
ConspiracyGrumps,3dz0ch,choosingusernames,2,Mon Jul 20 18:21:40 2015 UTC,"It's fairly normal for subs to not equal views, look at any major channel and the numbers don't tend to add up. Achievement Hunter's LP channel has ~3 million subs, but their latest Minecraft episode only has 600K views.  Look at any of the playlists, too. Their views are generally higher at the start of the LP than at the end, with a little bump for the finale ones, Mario 64 is a good example. And if something special happens in an episode, ie that Knuckles glitch + Arin Rage in Sonic '06, that episode will also have a huge bump in viewers.  What you'd probably have to consider is looking at an episode after about a week and compare the views to subscribers from a percentage than just a straight number."

That something that makes you hesitate about it, you don't want it to happen again.  I've had a similar situation happen to me, my best friend from childhood, we would hang out, look out for each other, all that shit, but something happened, and we couldn't trust each other anymore, I could sense it whenever we spoke.

ConspiracyGrumps,3dtmf4,Kolby_Jack,7,Sun Jul 19 10:29:26 2015 UTC,"if you know you're sick, STAY HOME. It's utterly selfish to put others at risk just to satisfy your nerdy desires.   This may sound like an easy choice, but you have to realize that people spend a lot of money buying tickets, hotel rooms, travel expenses, etc. just to see their favorite content creators. When you've spent hundreds if not $1000+ just for that alone, it can be tough to decide to just not attend because you came down with a cold the day before or something.  People should definitely be washing their hands a lot more, but I feel like the best way to solve the problem is to start changing this expectation that every person who asks a question is entitled to a hug. Start the panel off clearly saying that ""hey, we always get really sick after cons so we won't be doing any hugs or handshakes. We love you guys, but for everyone's health we're not going to be doing it."" I feel like any reasonable person would understand and be cool with it."
ConspiracyGrumps,3dtmf4,joebillybob,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:11:05 2015 UTC,"But have you heard how they react to the prospect of money? A couple thousand dollars isn't anything in their minds. They literally looked up and decided to buy a high speed camera for shits and giggles in Mario Sunshine, and their reaction to the price tag was almost as if it was lower than their daily entertainment spending budget."
ConspiracyGrumps,3dtmf4,LVL100Pumbloom,4,Mon Jul 20 00:47:31 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about the folks who pay to go see them, not the Grumps themselves. When you've thrown down a lot of money to go see someone, it makes sense that even if you're sick you'll still want to go.  As for the Grumps, they made their money. As a matter of fact, we gave it to them through watching their videos. So whatever they choose to spend their money on is their choice. Considering Arin runs the company, he likely knows the general budget they have to work with and pulled it from there rather than his own pocket (since it would be for Grump use, not just his own). But I'm not sure what any of that has to do with cons and sickness."
ConspiracyGrumps,3dtmf4,joebillybob,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:35:37 2015 UTC,"I was commenting on how the Grumps would consider not going after spending that money an acceptable loss for anyone because they don't seem to understand it's value. Basically I was saying they don't realize that to other people things they consider cheap can be months, even an entire years worth of saving up."
ConspiracyGrumps,3dtmf4,LVL100Pumbloom,3,Mon Jul 20 01:47:01 2015 UTC,"I can safely say I don't make Grump money. I'm a low-ranked enlisted military guy, so while I'm certainly better off than a lot of people in both pay and benefits, I'm not exactly wealthy. I admit I don't really know what it feels like to live paycheck to paycheck, or to save up a lot of money for something really cool just to have wasted. But even still, I know a selfish decision when I see one. Putting yourself and others at risk just to justify your purchases and achieve some life highlight is pretty selfish.  EDIT: Also, while the grumps are making bank now, Both Arin (and Suzy) and Danny have been dirt poor before. They've said so many times, so I think they do know what it's like, probably more than I do."

I can't agree, I can't agree with any of what you said and I don't blame your opinion or anything.  I can't see it as being selfish to not want to frivolously have wasted money you may have worked yourself to death for. Having a cold, or any non life threatening bug shouldn't bar you from going and force you to sacrifice your emotional health and money because some other people might be inconvenienced for up to a week afterwards. Not in this case at least, not the case of something that's once a year and costs so much.  Not being able to go to a movie you want to see, or a concert, or something else that doesn't cost you nearly a thousand dollars or more, sure, it's selfish. But I feel like there's a line where it stops being selfish, and it can be a monetary line, partially because you spent a large amount of time in your life that can not be given back to earn that money at that point, and then on top of that you don't get to even attend the thing you spent the money on and can't even get the money back.  Maybe I'm just too frugal, but I know what it's like to have literally nothing, be less than simply dirt poor, and even now that I have all my money I can't stop thinking as though it's not the case anymore. Money doesn't lose value just because you find yourself suddenly rolling in it.  Edit: I really want to stress that I can try to see where you're coming from and appreciate your opinion on the matter. We just came from and live in different worlds. I guess I was just trying to convey, without trying to be too pushy, that I come from a place where money literally does make the world go round and through no fault of my own, or anyone else in the situation, the thought of money straight up being wasted can be crushing emotionally and have a long standing impact on someone's future.  I don't honestly expect anyone to agree with me, I just felt it needed to be said."
ConspiracyGrumps,3dtmf4,LVL100Pumbloom,2,Mon Jul 20 10:30:57 2015 UTC,"What you said makes sense, especially in regards to time wasted, which is something I really can't stand. I did say I don't blame people for thinking this way. Even still, I would stress that sick people should stay home for the good of everyone. If they really can't let it go, they can at least take every other precaution: medicine, hygiene, containment. A lot of people don't even bother with those, which is just dumb."

Cool story I have, feel free to skip it if you want:  One year I attended a convention where a group gave out medical facemasks to attendees who wanted them as well as set up hand sanitizer stations throughout the convention hall. They even had a booth in the entryway hall where they stocked over the counter medicines and the like.  I wish I could see that at every convention, in fact I wish it was a standard health code required for conventions, because I feel it's not only just the best idea ever for these things, but also really considerate to everyone attending.  I'm glad we were able to agree on some things!"

Meeting a Satanist is nothing to gasp and hide under the bed sheets about.

So if it unsettles you because you have a misunderstanding of Satanists as willfully worshipping evil (to Satanists, Satan is not evil) then you need to educate yourself.

It kinda makes sense when you consider how big GG has become, but it seems unnecessary. Channels like Markiplier are even more popular and I think that's a solo project.   Edit: I'm not hating on the Grumps when I say this, by the way. I just think since they now have six regular members, it seems weird that they'd need another person just to do busy work. None of us know how they truly operate, though."
ConspiracyGrumps,3dsqf0,TrappedInThaCloset,4,Sun Jul 19 03:42:55 2015 UTC,"I gotta ask and this is me being truthfully because I commented about this on Rant Grumps and I got downvoted: Why does everyone hate Kevin on some of these reddits? I personally find him a good editor and love his humor, but yet whenever I see someone mention Kevin either on here or Rant grumps, it's always ""Kevin sucks at his job, Kevin sucks, Kevin's the worst"". Why is that?"
ConspiracyGrumps,3dsqf0,Metalcentraldialog,14,Sun Jul 19 06:44:27 2015 UTC,"Various reasons. There are some examples where the Grumps demand something and he doesn't deliver. James Bond Jr. with Markiplier would be an example of that. I think it was the first episode, where he ignores 2-3 requests. Another was during their Sonic 3 playthrough where Ross demanded a seizure warning during a bonus stage. Instead of making an annotation or edit it in the video, he puts it into the description. How many people read descriptions of a GG video, especially before they watch the video?  The other thing is, that Kevin doesn't do something by himself, like Barry did. Quite a lot of Barry's edits were unrequested, which made it much more fun. Kevin never does that. He just does what is requested and sometimes even ignores that.   The final problem is, that he did fuck up the audio quite a few times. Some cases with to loud or to quiet game sound. Stuff like that.   Overall, Kevin is considered a slacker, who does the bare minimum for what is required and after being used to Barry, this is a notable step backwards in terms of quality."

ConspiracyGrumps,3dsqf0,Metalcentraldialog,3,Sun Jul 19 06:57:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Kevin has a history of missing many requested edits and just very rarely doing unprovoked edits. He has also made minor mistakes involving things like the outro or the audio.  This wouldn't be as bad if he was there since the beginning, but since he replaced the highly loved Barry, it's considered worse.  Also, complaints about Barry are all about him as a commentator rather than an editor. As an editor he was loved."
ConspiracyGrumps,3dsqf0,cheesycoke,3,Sun Jul 19 07:52:10 2015 UTC,"I personally am okay with Kevin, I find him pretty enjoyable and you can tell he is trying to be a great editor, but sadly is struggling with his mistakes. And I think that's what the problem is. When you replace someone as respected like Barry, everyone is going to shit on you because you aren't them.  I know that for a fact some people feel Barry as a commentator is pretty meh, some even saying he sounds drunk. As an editor, there's no need to comment since we know how awesome he is."
ConspiracyGrumps,3dsqf0,Metalcentraldialog,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:54:35 2015 UTC,"But that's the thing, to a lot of people it looks like he isn't, or at least wasn't trying.

Most were at least cautiously optimistic about him replacing Barry."
ConspiracyGrumps,3dsqf0,cheesycoke,2,Sun Jul 19 08:12:41 2015 UTC,"True enough, I noticed that he was happily accepted as the Grump's new editor, probably because unlike Jon's messy departure and the abruptness of Danny's introduction and Steam Train, we were already suspecting Barry had stepped down."

There's also surely lots of stuff they're working on that we don't know about yet. GG is a growing brand and interns are useful. For someone wanting to get into production or work with Maker, even if it's unpaid, internships that lead to networking are how you get experience and work in the entertainment industry.  This is pure speculation, but I would guess that their intern(s) are paid, going by how strongly Arin seems to feel about GG Animated guest artists getting paid fairly. I don't remember which video it was in but it was relatively recently and he mentioned having a minimum length for them, solely to insure he'd be able to pay them what he feels they deserve based on YouTube's monetization policy."

The rule hasn't really been enforced and while the Jon mentions-megathread does serve as an excellent standalone archive, it's not exactly optimized for discussion. As the individual threads have proven, we do enjoy talking about the mentions as they happen. Not all of us watch every single episode of Game Grumps, either, so it's easy to miss out.  There's no point in having unnecessary rules, is there? I think revising or removing Rule 5 is warranted."

ConspiracyGrumps,3dnyu2,ProfDrTitsmack,2,Sat Jul 18 17:15:07 2015 UTC,What is the etsy debacle? I'm new to this sub.
ConspiracyGrumps,3dnyu2,meow_mix8,2,Sun Jul 19 23:45:59 2015 UTC,"suzy lied on her etsy blog regarding descriptions of her products  with particular attention to the fact that she proudly advertised them as being bought locally when it was found they weren’t. then when people put together the research together and asked her about it she lied about it, but that was an older incident  then later there was basically someone getting more information on the issue in the etsy store, focusing on the 200%-600% markup of price from stuff you could buy for like 3 dollars idk from other etsy sellers  i was a bit upset because sure, it’s not anything extremely illegal, but i feel like she was taking advantage of the fanbase  and the one thing that is very clear was the initial lie, and trust is something that is hard to be gained back, yknow?"
ConspiracyGrumps,3dnyu2,sciencelabrador,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:18:54 2015 UTC,Oh I see. Thank you for the response. That is sad :(I don't know too much about her. Why do some people say she is like Yoko Ono?

ConspiracyGrumps,3dnu7p,pureorangeness,0,Tue Jul 21 13:08:43 2015 UTC,What's the context of this being brought up again? Did they bring up Sonic 06 recently?
ConspiracyGrumps,3dnu7p,PunyParker826,3,Sat Jul 18 01:33:12 2015 UTC,"I think it's because people keep theorizing a Grumpcade or Game Grumps where Jon comes back and they finish 06. That the three year anniversary of GG just passed I'm sure had something to do with it. But, nothing official has ever been said about this possibility."
ConspiracyGrumps,3dneie,Kolby_Jack,21,Fri Jul 17 18:07:04 2015 UTC,"I would agree with your theory, if not for Jon's consistent hinting at some kind of incident. Especially at that one panel, where somebody asked him what the worst part of his career was. He said leaving GG was the worst part of the career, and that there was dishonesty in the matter. Everyone else on the panel reacted very similarly, especially ProJared. He's still a fairly frequent GG guest, and he looked fairly tense/annoyed about the situation. On the Grumps side, the fact that Arin outright lied about Jon not wanting to be associated with the Grumps is the most suspicious part. If he isn't above publicly lying like that, then what is he capable of in private? That sounds super dramatic, but I'm not sure how else to put it. I don't think Arin is a bad person and I don't suspect him of any terrible wrongdoing, I'm just trying to summarize the counter-argument to your theory. If it's true that nothing that bad happened, then the fault is on Jon (and others like TotalBiscuit, for example) for making it look that way."
ConspiracyGrumps,3dneie,grump_k_ultra,4,Fri Jul 17 18:45:56 2015 UTC,"Well, when he left GG it was a sudden decision, AND he moved to New York at the same time. I can't imagine it was enjoyable for anyone. I don't know about the ""dishonesty"" part, perhaps Arin just didn't tell him that he was going to not mention Jon on GG and Jon was upset about it. I'm just trying to counteract the sinister explanations some people here seem to have for everything. These are otherwise decent human beings we're talking about, after all."
ConspiracyGrumps,3dneie,thegooblop,4,Fri Jul 17 19:05:23 2015 UTC,"They wouldn't say things like ""I can't talk about that"" or ""I'm not allowed to say"" if it was something small. Jon has said a few times that he feels bad about it and wanted to tell people, but he acts like there's some contract sealing his lips.   If it was really small anyone with common sense would say ""We should just tell them because it'll always be a problem for the rest of the Grump's existence if we don't.""  ""Jon left to do Jontron"" is the kind of excuse we would get no matter why Jon left, it applies to any situation short of Jon dying or becoming Amish.  It doesn't have to be some sinister plot, but if it was as small as you suggest there would be a lot more information about the incident, and there wouldn't be some foul air every time Jon was brought up at a panel or something. The situation where they edited the Miiverse post in Mario 3D World is enough to show that -something- happened."
ConspiracyGrumps,3dneie,Emperor-Nero,2,Fri Jul 17 21:58:39 2015 UTC,"I kind of agree it is like when a band says someone left to focus on other projects,but you just know there is some bad blood there. Trust me I know from experience about bad blood in a band."
ConspiracyGrumps,3dneie,captaingymshorts,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:55:49 2015 UTC,Wasn't that miiverse post theory disproven?
ConspiracyGrumps,3dneie,thegooblop,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:08:16 2015 UTC,"It was proven beyond a doubt that they edited the post.  Someone did say ""hey, this is the post that was there"" and was wrong, but that DID lead to the discovery that the post they said was ""replacing"" the deleted post actually belonged on a different level. Every level has it's own posts, and levels give stickers too. Someone noticed the post had a sticker, and they went to the level that sticker is earned in and found that the post actually was copied and pasted. The Grumps took unused footage from another level, and copy and pasted a post over a different post for sure unless they just so happened to run into a glitch where a single post shows up in the wrong level, but nobody else reported something like that ever. The reactions the grumps had to seeing the post also show that they saw SOMETHING they didn't like, and it turned out a post about Jon was posted right at the same time on the same level as the two posts NEXT to the one that was edited.   TLDR; We know for a fact they edited it, and we have a 99.99% guess of which post was actually there but it would be impossible to prove that fully. It was likely a post about ""Ech/Acknowledge Jontron"" based on the evidence."
ConspiracyGrumps,3dneie,thegooblop,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:41:43 2015 UTC,"The miiverse post just said ""Acknowledge Jontron"" right? Policy at the time was not to. I don't really see how that proves anything beyond they were still not acknowledging Jon at the time."
ConspiracyGrumps,3dneie,TrappedInThaCloset,2,Fri Jul 17 23:15:40 2015 UTC,"They didn't have to go through the trouble to edit out the post though. If they skipped 10 seconds of video nobody would have mentioned it, or if they did it would just be ""Yeah, that was weird, maybe they took a break and had to cut something.""  You're right that it just proves they were still not mentioning Jon in any way, but the amount of effort they put towards not mentioning him is huge. Why go through so much effort if there isn't something to hide? It's like the Streisand effect, if they want something hidden it makes people want it more."
ConspiracyGrumps,3dneie,TrappedInThaCloset,3,Fri Jul 17 23:32:54 2015 UTC,"But if it were just something vanilla like that, them choosing to ignore Jon entirely would be a horrible PR move. By never talking about Jon and acting so secretive about it, they raised a lot of questions about what actually happened and caused a lot of turmoil in their fanbase. If it had actually been boring and they were telling the truth all along, I really don't think they would have acted so strangely about it."
ConspiracyGrumps,3dneie,thegooblop,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:11:16 2015 UTC,"Well, I never said it was a SMART decision. Arin has an odd viewpoint on some things. I'm sure it seemed like a good idea back then."
ConspiracyGrumps,3dneie,WhatHappenedToEvaXep,2,Fri Jul 17 20:23:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Arin makes some questionable decisions in terms of PR, but if he had actually done this, it would have been a major boner on his part."
ConspiracyGrumps,3dneie,MagicMan350,2,Fri Jul 17 20:34:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think people give Arin enough credit for PR stuff. Outside of Suzy (who seems to make constant PR mistakes) the Grumps know how to do PR stuff really well.  They connect with fans enough to make the show thrive, they make business deals and connections that make large profits, they know basic PR talk (Like how Dan gave a perfect PR-friendly but meaningless response at a panel when someone asked about Jon) and logic, too. Arin can make connections to do stuff like get on Playstation's The Tester show as a contestant, and get to be in this year's Nintendo World Championship. Both of those require a lot of skill in PR, even if it doesn't show.  Arin is more than smart enough not to hide why Jon left unless it's really bad."
ConspiracyGrumps,3dneie,thegooblop,5,Fri Jul 17 22:13:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. If it was boring, they'd say so. If it was nasty drama, they would prefer NOT to say so."
ConspiracyGrumps,3dneie,thegooblop,0,Fri Jul 17 19:16:49 2015 UTC,"But they DID say so. They said Jon left to do JonTron. Then people accused them of not telling the whole story, and that's when they completely stopped talking about it. At this point they probably don't think any detail would satisfy everyone and would just reopen the whole can of bees."
ConspiracyGrumps,3dneie,Konjik,6,Fri Jul 17 19:33:28 2015 UTC,"Which is why they refused to talk about it afterwards for the longest time, right?"
ConspiracyGrumps,3dneie,grump_k_ultra,0,Fri Jul 17 19:36:59 2015 UTC,"When you tell someone what happened and why and they don't believe you, what else can you do? You've given them what you believe is a satisfactory answer, and if they don't find it satisfactory, well, you just shrug and ignore them. It's what I'd do."
ConspiracyGrumps,3dneie,Sato_Satellite,2,Fri Jul 17 19:44:14 2015 UTC,"You aren't a company that makes a ton of money off of your public appearance, though. GG has a lawyer and a bunch of people hired behind the scenes for this kind of stuff, and if it was small enough not to matter they wouldn't drag it out and ignore it for two years, because it hurts the bottom line.  ""Jon left to do Jontron"" is an effect, not a cause. Did he leave because he thought Jontron could make more money? Certainly not. Did he leave because Game Grumps wasn't fun anymore and he had fun making Jontron videos? Maybe, but if that's true than THAT is what you say. Obviously he left, and he makes more Jontron videos now, but that can't possibly be WHY he left because that isn't a reason to leave. Jon's smart enough not to just decide to move across the country and leave his easy, low effort, high paying job for no reason. We already know he didn't do it just because his girlfriend was in NY, so nothing short of ""there was something nasty"" makes sense given all we know."
ConspiracyGrumps,3dneie,theboatleft,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:06:48 2015 UTC,"But see, YOU say they're dragging it out, but they aren't. They're ignoring it. To them, it's already over and done with. They aren't baiting us or anything like that. They just don't talk about it. And I doubt any of this hurts the bottom line much at all. CG makes up a tiny portion of the fanbase. Most fans don't seem to care anymore now that Jon gets mentioned.  Jon leaving to do JonTron could very easily be a cause. Arin would probably stop GGing if he could animate full time, but there's no money in it. JonTron DOES make money, and if Jon's passionate about it, I could see him leaving Grumps for it."
ConspiracyGrumps,3dneie,Emperor-Nero,2,Fri Jul 17 23:05:47 2015 UTC,"And I doubt any of this hurts the bottom line much at all. CG makes up a tiny portion of the fanbase.   It hurts it more than simply explaining the situation possibly could, unless there was something worth hiding.   Jon leaving to do JonTron could very easily be a cause.   It couldn't be the main cause. Maybe there were a bunch of reasons, and Jontron was one of them, but ""Jon left to make Jontron"" isn't a main cause. Someone doesn't move halfway across the country to leave everyone they know behind and quit a great job so they can work on a harder job with much less pay. Maybe Jon wasn't proud of GG anymore, so he went to make something he COULD be proud of, but that doesn't make ""Jon left to make Jontron"" the cause, it makes ""Jon was no longer proud of GG"" a cause and ""Jon left to make Jontron"" an effect."

ConspiracyGrumps,3dgxgf,JustSmashh,7,Thu Jul 16 04:36:06 2015 UTC,"I cannot handle the grumps playing another long-ass boring long series game  Anyway, Arin hates FF7"
ConspiracyGrumps,3dgxgf,LC_Music,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:31:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly, even being a fan of FF7 I'm interested in hearing Arin's perspective and why he hates it, and I'm not afraid of him bashing it. But I also agree that the long games are starting to get annoying."
ConspiracyGrumps,3dgxgf,Deviate85,2,Thu Jul 16 08:41:30 2015 UTC,Arin was 'interviewed' (not sure if that is the best word to describe that) for Jirard's multi-part FF7 episodes. Spoiler: he was indifferent about the whole thing while all other interviewees had very fond memories of the game.
ConspiracyGrumps,3dgxgf,Tom_Dynamite,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:38:58 2015 UTC,"I did watch it and it was interesting how Arin's view of the game changed over the video.

ConspiracyGrumps,3dfplq,JustAThrowaway4563,2,Thu Jul 16 09:31:47 2015 UTC,Jon is going to start his own rap band with Stamper to rival Starbomb. East side!
ConspiracyGrumps,3dfplq,Deviate85,11,Fri Jul 17 15:18:00 2015 UTC,"It's so obscure to me to think that people get so offended with the concept of parody music; nobody is claiming that parody music is an art form deserving of your respect or admiration; it's just funny stuff people like to listen to. I don't listen to any really, but if I ever to listen to Starbomb, it's not like I'm doing so to be impressed by the songwriting or to have my intellectual fancies tickled. I just want to laugh about something. Music doesn't have to be something that is complex or meaningful."
ConspiracyGrumps,3dfplq,somenewinfo,2,Wed Jul 15 22:50:17 2015 UTC,"-- The point -->  ( Your head )  Honestly though, that's is a pretty banal critique that's been made countless times. I'm not disagreeing with your claim that repetition in comedy ruins flow and quality, but like I said, I'm not defending the quality or intellectual integrity of an album about video games (shocking, I know). I'm just saying, calm down. It's music. Either way, dick jokes and the like can easily be found in some of the earliest comedies: they're not this new degenerate tool; I really wish people would stop acting like they are."
ConspiracyGrumps,3dfplq,somenewinfo,2,Fri Jul 17 03:44:20 2015 UTC,"There's nothing that really points out anything directly related to Starbomb; there are plenty of people who have done musical videogame parodies long before Danny and Arin did. It seems to me the lyrics are meant to be more self-deprecating and meta, lamenting how the idea of making a parody rap is easily profitable and, in his mind, of little effort. The fact the video is a ""COD rap"" makes this a lot more likely, considering how much of a stereotypically popular game COD is."
ConspiracyGrumps,3dfplq,HighlordSmiley,2,Fri Jul 17 11:38:06 2015 UTC,I don't think he was talking about Starbomb at all.
ConspiracyGrumps,3dfplq,MellowM1nds,3,Thu Jul 16 08:25:54 2015 UTC,"Not entirely GG related but the song seems to direct animosity towards Starbomb. Jon in the past has distinctly expressed disinterest towards not creating ""parody music"" (from his MAGFest panel) and him and Yungtown are more than likely acquainted since of Yungtown's affilation with Hidden Block (a site Shane from DYKG created). They probably all talked shit about Arin and Starbomb in the past which inspired Yungtown to write this."
ConspiracyGrumps,3dfplq,Tom_Dynamite,2,Thu Jul 16 22:04:06 2015 UTC,"I don't know if intentional, but most of the stuff he said can pretty much be said about his music too. So I don't know if he is just trying to be self aware or just trying to shit on others while not being much better himself. The last one would be really hilarious."
ConspiracyGrumps,3dfplq,MellowM1nds,3,Wed Jul 15 22:31:41 2015 UTC,"Not really? Luke doesn't really do that. Each of his songs has an original beat, and original rap, original flows, etc. etc.  He's talking more about the Pokemon Thug Rappers who do exactly what he mentioned in this song."

ConspiracyGrumps,3da8u4,MellowM1nds,18,Wed Jul 15 17:34:25 2015 UTC,probably because suzy sucks at comedy and is also probably terrified of their internet money fountain drying up
ConspiracyGrumps,3da8u4,furyextralarge,7,Wed Jul 15 05:31:02 2015 UTC,"I think Arin knows that Game Grumps doesn't need to last as long, especially because you can tell he and Ross are getting back into drawing and animating, so they are probably going to wait until they know that Animation can be viable again, and at a point where they know that they can pay a team to make their content come out faster. Which is probably why Ross and Arin said ""Dead"" pretty quickly because they have a feeling that their animations can draw(pun intended) in an audience because of the fans they've gotten from Grumps. Plus due to the fact that Brian is now in LA, NSP can produce more content which gives Dan a good source of income."
ConspiracyGrumps,3da8u4,thisisdot,11,Wed Jul 15 03:02:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's no way the series could still exist without some major changes. There are a lot of different people involved, even if all of them survive in good health some of them may move on to other things, because most of them have real passion for things like animation or music, which take a lot of time.  Maybe the changes will be as small as ""Dan went on to focus on music, Kevin is a regular member, Grumpcade became much bigger, and more side series spring up."", but I'm guessing the show will be more different than that if it still produces content at all."
ConspiracyGrumps,3da8u4,thegooblop,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:30:37 2015 UTC,"Oh, if Dan leaves I think I'd be done. I can't take another Not-So-Grump leaving. But, it honestly does make a lot of sense. Now that he has a big audience, he could finally start to dedicate himself to music full time. I'd love to hear his more serious stuff a la Skyhill."
ConspiracyGrumps,3da8u4,Rjr18,5,Wed Jul 15 20:49:38 2015 UTC,"It'll absolutely be dead. I honestly give it two years, max."
ConspiracyGrumps,3da8u4,ghost_movement,4,Tue Jul 14 22:05:47 2015 UTC,"They're right, Game Grumps (and most gaming Yotube stuff like Jontron and Completionist) will probably be dead in the next couple of years"
ConspiracyGrumps,3da8u4,IndifferentSandwich,2,Wed Jul 15 04:27:27 2015 UTC,"Some parts of the gaming community on Youtube will probably die but I think gaming itself will always be a big part of Youtube. Gamers like Pewdiepie, Markiplier and all those facecam dudes who play characters or just overreact while playing, will probably die. This has been done to death and they are somewhat to similar to each other. Something similar can be said about comedy reviewers like JonTron, AngryJoe, PBG, etc. Channels like that come out of nowhere and even though they will never run out of games, they will someday run out of jokes and ideas to build a script around it.  As with LP channels, gameplay channels and regular reviews, those will probably always exist and for good reasons. Gameplay channels are the demos of our time. You are interested in a game, you watch some gameplay footage if it is worth checking out. Interested in reviews? Why reading it like your grandparents, when you can just sit back and watch someone review it? LP channels, while probably some will disappear, will probably not die. If anything, it will become more of a Twitch thing. I often enjoy watching people play games, that I probably will never play myself because I don't have X-Box One for example. It's also good because you can see someones genuine playthrough, which gives you a better idea what the game is like. The biggest part is probably the commentary, which depending on what channels you like, is either more comedy based, more like a podcast or informative."

ConspiracyGrumps,3czqyf,SnipingBeaver,3,Sun Jul 12 18:06:59 2015 UTC,"Because it's not like a Let's Play show.  GameGrumps is just a game system, a TV, a couple microphones, and some technical shit for the capture.  Table Flip has a large camera crew with very high-quality cameras and microphones. They actually fly in guests whereas, say, GrumpCade guests only appear on the show when they happen to be in the area."
ConspiracyGrumps,3czqyf,SnipingBeaver,3,Sun Jul 12 19:08:49 2015 UTC,"I understand that, what I'm asking is why the crew and set and costumes are necessary"
ConspiracyGrumps,3czqyf,IguanadonsEverywhere,2,Sun Jul 12 19:28:45 2015 UTC,"I don't know why they though the set and costumes was a good idea, I assume the idea was that board games are old-fashioned so they get old-fashioned outfits. At this point though, most of the money is going into getting people there and filming, two things that they'd need to pay for if they did the whole historic thing or if they filmed them in t-shirts and sweats in someone's basement."
ConspiracyGrumps,3czqyf,Stormedwolf,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:20:58 2015 UTC,I like the theme. I like to see what each guest did for their outfit. If I want something casual I just watch the regular show.
ConspiracyGrumps,3czqyf,samsim1990,2,Sun Jul 12 23:18:09 2015 UTC,"I've heard from several places, including the main sub (EDIT: Not that the main sub is the guardian of all knowledge, but it seems to be well supported - or accepted as true), that the original idea was taken out of context by the designers at Polaris/Maker. Barry and Suzy said they wanted a show where they would play old fashioned games, as in board games/table top games.   Evidently the set designers and Polaris/Maker people decided it was going to be an old fashioned show, turning it into the pseudo-Victorian themed controversy it's become. I don't know when along the process the warping of ideas began to happen, but it must've gotten to the point where too much money had been put in to go back on it - or it was poorly communicated back to the grumps what was actually happening with the show, and thus no one was alarmed."
ConspiracyGrumps,3czqyf,TaylorCulosis,3,Mon Jul 13 05:20:15 2015 UTC,As if anyone would be dumb to pay $20. Thats the end of table flip I guess.
ConspiracyGrumps,3czqyf,themando,13,Sun Jul 12 21:26:32 2015 UTC,"I shudder to think that anyone out there is actually paying to watch other people play board/card games. Then again, I'm also pretty certain that Grumblr folk don't actually have hard-earned money."
ConspiracyGrumps,3czqyf,spookymunchkin,5,Sun Jul 12 07:25:12 2015 UTC,"I watch this series called Beer & Board Games. Every week or two, they hold a night where they livestream 4 hours worth of board games (along with getting drunk) for $5. Within a few days they uploaded an edited video of it to YT.   Is it bad that I pay to see the livestream? I don't think so, and I don't necessarily think it's bad if people pay for Table Flip (though I definitely won't). There's a market for everybody."
ConspiracyGrumps,3czqyf,TaylorCulosis,2,Sun Jul 12 17:33:36 2015 UTC,"$5 is reasonable but they're asking for $20 and it's not even a livestream, i think it's ridiculous."
ConspiracyGrumps,3czqyf,themando,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:48:34 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I just feel like I'd rather rent a movie or two.  I suppose it's not too different from being a RoosterTeeth sponsor. Getting the episodes a day earlier is a nice bonus, but I like supporting the show's I enjoy, regardless. (I just wish there was an option to choose what team(s) you support with the payment. I couldn't care less about funding LPs.)  In either case, both of our scenarios are more affordable than whatever Polaris is pulling."

ConspiracyGrumps,3czqyf,UMPUMN,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:16:40 2015 UTC,"rather than withholding what they'd normally produce.    They aren't though.  You're paying to see it two months early. That's exactly what several people do with their Patreons.  Still shitty, but it's wrong to say people who do it through Patreon are any better."
ConspiracyGrumps,3czqyf,UMPUMN,3,Sun Jul 12 12:25:51 2015 UTC,"Except it's not really ""early"" in this context.   The episode is done, but they've moved the release date back to get money from suckers who sign up for Sling.  And Patreon/Vessel subscribers tend to get more stuff, too, for much cheaper.  Table Flip fans only get one ~35 minute video once a month."
ConspiracyGrumps,3czqyf,henrykazuka,2,Sun Jul 12 17:51:04 2015 UTC,"But if I'm remembering correctly (I'm probably wrong, it's been a while since I've been on Patreon), you only get paid wheb you actually put something out, instead of a flat monthly fee."

ConspiracyGrumps,3cwxmw,uss1701jb,2,Sat Jul 11 19:30:18 2015 UTC,NeoGrumps I can't answer because I never been on that subreddit but VentGrumps was shut down because the main mod GameGrumpGate supposedly had a change of heart and said we shouldn't be making fun of them or criticizing the grumps so he shut it down.
ConspiracyGrumps,3cwxmw,AllisonRages,4,Sat Jul 11 22:41:35 2015 UTC,"Ventgrumps was was covered pretty well by /u/zakktravis as for /r/Neogrumps it's largely based around how /u/BrineDudeGaming (creator of the subreddit) was constantly trolled because of a GrumpStream thing he did and got tons of undeserved hate from it. These trolls attacked both /r/Neogrumps and him personally where he apparently received death threats. He ended up deleting his reddit account and made the subreddit private. He removed the entire mod team so at this point the subreddit is basically dead. I know all this since I've been a mod for the channel since it started, while the sub had its problems, most of the trouble was from the trolls that followed Brine (admittivly Brine himself did have a habit of having too tight of control over the sub that I disagreed with). But yeah, the sub is pretty much gone for good now."

I think (dont quote me) the backlash came with how he advertised it on other subs. I'm probially wrong but that's what I gathered."
ConspiracyGrumps,3cwxmw,Finndogs,-4,Sat Jul 11 21:37:37 2015 UTC,How did he remove most of the mod team if he was towards the bottom of the mod list? How did he set it to private if he wasn't a mod at all before the sub went private?

You need to stalk him. Learn his schedule. Learn when he's alone. Learn when he's vulnerable. Then, when there are no witnesses present, kidnap him. Pull up in a van, pop out with a gun, and demand that he gets inside. Once he's in, blindfold him and bind his wrists and ankles. Then drive off to a secluded abandoned warehouse.  Once Jon is in the warehouse, tie him to a chair. Remove his blindfold. The first thing he should see is your wide array of torture devices.  Shine a bright light into Jon's face, and repeat after me in your most intimidating voice:  ""I'm only going to ask you nicely one time. Why did Game Grumps break up?""

That's not to say people shouldn't feel upset about that game, but it doesn't really count the way a Sonic 06-type of title would have. I mean, this was a game released as a tie-in to a TV series.

So the idea of it being something they came up with (getting some guy that's 'one of us' for our approval) in order to save themselves from the embarrassment of titles like Boom doesn't make much sense.  Also like I've said, the only title that's really even considered to be 'bad' widely in the past 5-6 years is Boom, and that wasn't even a Sonic Team game..."

It totally misses the point that maybe the character is suppose to be stupid or not think things through. I have noticed that when you make a woman dumb it is apprantly an insult to women though.

ConspiracyGrumps,3crorz,LVL100Pumbloom,5,Fri Jul 10 06:56:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think you knew Arin before Game Grumps, He's been good at his improv since his Newgrounds days."
ConspiracyGrumps,3crorz,Vercci,7,Fri Jul 10 06:22:06 2015 UTC,"Arin never did improv before, Jon even says in one episode ""We gotta get you to some improv classes"" because Arin commented about how much better Jon was at improvised observational humor."
ConspiracyGrumps,3crorz,LVL100Pumbloom,2,Fri Jul 10 06:54:48 2015 UTC,"To my knowledge, Arin didn't do improv before Game Grumps.  Newgrounds animations are not improvisations because they aren't live. You bullshit into a microphone for hours and pick only the best stuff (and then probably rerecord parts of it). Or you write a script.  Either way, it isn't like Game Grumps where they use almost everything they record, no second takes."
ConspiracyGrumps,3crorz,LVL100Pumbloom,6,Fri Jul 10 06:46:25 2015 UTC,"For one, that's an incredibly opinionated statement.  For two, he has also called all those ""improv"" sessions for those cartoons ""just saying what comes to mind"" and ""bullshitting into a mic"". He also told Jon on Game Grumps that he has never taken improv classes or anything requiring as much improv as Game Grumps before starting on it. A lot of people can be funny just randomly spewing bullshit for a little, bonus points to having a little video behind it and adding silly voices. The cartoons are improvised in the sense that he did them in one take and made changes to the planned dialogue as he spoke, he just had a pretty solid mental outline of what he wanted to say and the characters behaviors and such, as demonstrated by him talking about all his Lemon and Bill ideas and how fleshed out they are on the show.  I don't think he's the funniest, myself. He's great with someone he can work off of well when he wants to, but he's not good as the main act when it comes to improv comedy. Jon and Ross are funny to me, then Dan, then Barry, then Arin, and finally Suzy. Put Jon and Arin in a room and they're the funniest together, then Ross and Dan, then Jon and Barry, then Barry and Suzy, then Arin and Dan, and that's all the combos I've seen of the group that I can think of besides Ross and Arin, but they weren't making jokes they were literally just having a conversation while Jirard played Sonic 3. Also Jon and Ross, but they were just talking, as well.  Edit: I think I find Jon much better at improv comedy because he can break the rules in the most spectacular and comical manner without ruining the flow, similar to the guys on Whose Line."
ConspiracyGrumps,3crorz,LVL100Pumbloom,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:17:09 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, no.  There's a difference between bullshitting into a mic and a structured form of comedy that relies on forming a consistent joke from what you're presented with. Improv comedy is also not just saying what comes to mind, that's like what you see in a beginner's class for improv that's not about structure or rules but rather learning to be creative. Improv is also not making up dialogue to fill in the blanks of a script, the entire skit needs to evolve and break away from it.  Basically, only beginners improv used to teach being logically creative under pressure and in limited time uses specifics past one initial set-up prop/location works anything like what those cartoons was, and even then is a stretch."
ConspiracyGrumps,3crorz,Emperor-Nero,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:23:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah no you're wrong they recently took improv courses remember they mentioned it,because none of them were that good at improv. Jon was as a whole good at improv,because he was a theater guy and while learning theater acting you must know improv as well."
ConspiracyGrumps,3crorz,Demolisho,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:39:54 2015 UTC,"Or maybe Arin is just very good at working off of other people.  This fits well with my theory: Arin put his effort into working well off of Jon, because that's what he was good at. Unfortunately, it meant that Arin was not focused on developing a strong technical skill. So long as he was receptive to Jon, he didn't have to. (Skill is internal, not a part of a relationship.)  Edit- Unfortunately, he did become less receptive to Jon - the show and their relationship did suffer."

Plus he could be a little loud when promoting something, like Neo Grumps. He actually had a few dedicated trolls following him around various subs and harassing him, if I recall. It did seem most of what he said was met with more negativity than it deserved. He was basically the kind of person that would normally be ignored and fade into the background after awhile, yet somehow he got all the wrong kinds of attention."
ConspiracyGrumps,3cp7tt,choosingusernames,3,Fri Jul 10 02:42:54 2015 UTC,Thanks. Sounds like a shitty situation for that guy. Hopefully everything turns out okay for him.
ConspiracyGrumps,3cp7tt,Tom_Dynamite,3,Fri Jul 10 04:52:38 2015 UTC,"Tl;dr several months ago he made something called ""Grumpstream."" Basically it was something where people could get together and watch episodes of Game Grumps. Pretty innocent, right?  Then he and another person advertised it on the main three Grumps subs (/r/GameGrumps, this one, and /r/VentGrumps). This was met with outroar by the community, as it was a pretty douchey thing to do.   We didn't hear about him for a while, though my memory is fuzzy, so maybe we did. The next time his name popped up for some users was a few months ago, when his brand new sub, /r/NeoGrumps, showed up in the AlienTube feeds.   This sub was pretty innocent to start out with. Then, it started to be described as a  sub that was better than the main sub because it featured ""no censorship, better mods,"" and some other third thing. Still, it was only known by a handful of people.  During this time, people trolled /r/NeoGrumps and BrineDudeGaming.  Then, one day, we got three posts, one on each of the main subs. They were advertisements for /r/NeoGrumps This made quite a bit of people angry, including /r/VentGrumps founder /u/GameGrumpGate.   After that, there isn't really much to tell. BDG got followed around by his own special downvote-posse, eventually getting death threats 2 weeks ago. It appears he finally snapped yesterday."

I only typed the image text up because it bothered me that when I opened the image it was basically unreadable so I figured it's the neighborly thing to do.

ConspiracyGrumps,3choyc,JavelinTF2,3,Thu Jul 9 17:51:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly, GG probably isnt bringing in enough to support himself and Suzy, Barry, Ross, Dan, and Kevin."
ConspiracyGrumps,3choyc,bolt892,3,Wed Jul 8 07:33:54 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure GG makes a lot of money. Except for some videos, NSP gets around as much views as GG gets in a day. Ross doesn't do much on his channel anymore. Arin only has the occassional Starbomb video, which get many views (but the Grumps get the same in 1-2 weeks). Kevin & Barry don't have their own channel and live mostly just from Game Grumps. I think the ad revenue as well as the merchandise does make a lot of money. I mean, Arin did pay for a five week vacation to Japan with all the Grumps + Holly. That alone speaks volumes on how much they make."

I hope we can squeeze out a few more Dan+Ross point-and-click adventures before the inevitable happens. :P  No offense to Arin Suzy and Kevin, but Arin and Suzy kind of feel like that thing when your friend gets a girlfriend and suddenly you're not as important to them, so they eventually just stop hanging out with you, with Arin we know that won't happen because this is his job but part of me feels like he's just not really that into it anymore. With Kevin? I just don't really know much about him, I stopped watching often about a month before he joined up.  The only person I can think of who's collaborated with Arin before that could draw me back in would probably be Oney, I remember he did a pretty funny Let's Play thing with Arin a long while ago, but he's too busy doing other things to play games every day.

SleepyCast exemplifies that. I don't like that Arin is more filtered now, I'd prefer if he was more honest and used all the harsh vernacular he felt.   Jon and Arin talked about the use of word ""faggot"" on Ye Olde Grumps, and how it's used to refer to an annoying shit as opposed to a homosexual. Now, well... Arin doesn't want to hurt their Tumblr fanbase."

ConspiracyGrumps,3cchjp,thestinkyrat1,12,Tue Jul 7 23:54:17 2015 UTC,"I wholeheartedly disagree, because avoiding a word only gives it more power. Intent is always the key. If someone can take a term or scenario that held a lot of weight in the past and turn it into laughter, then we've made progress as a society. We've moved on.  Jon shouldn't avoid using the word ""retarded"" and Arin shouldn't shift his personality to account for new fans. It just makes their productions seem phony."

ConspiracyGrumps,3cchjp,TaylorCulosis,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:19:15 2015 UTC,"Non-disparagement clauses aren't commonplace in the traditional entertainment industry (they might be when you're affiliated with networks, but this is different than an NDA entirely) The Non-Disclosure Agreement would've been signed between Arin and Jon the moment they co-founded this business together. It's just common practice, especially in the entertainment industry.  And Polaris doesn't control any of their partners. Multichannel networks function more like agents/managers. They find better deals (such as brand deals, direct advertising, which means higher CPM rates) for a VERY small percentage of the profits. The only one with power in the relationship between content creator and MCN is the content creator"

ConspiracyGrumps,3cchjp,TaylorCulosis,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:52:31 2015 UTC,"There is a confirmed NDA (non-disclosure agreement) between Jon and Arin, either of them breaking it opens them to lawsuit and any terms listed in the contract under damages for failing their end of the contract. It's pretty standard. Theirs is a personal one, just between two people, which is pretty uncommon but still follows the same rules as if it were between businesses or a business and a person, et al.  Polaris and all other Maker subsidiaries have a non-disparagement agreement (Also called an NDA, I know it's fun) built into their standard contracts. This basically means you can't attack another person with a ""Maker"" contract. They can voice opinions or talk about facts, but they can't outright bash the person unless it's satirical."

ConspiracyGrumps,3c58g9,mistahxwallace,19,Sat Jul 4 22:29:44 2015 UTC,"If it ever happens, it will either be Jon and Ross or Jon and Danny.  Ross and Jon seem to really get along as well as Jon and Danny.  It wouldn't surprise me to see a Not So Grump and Not So Grump show with Danny and Jon if Jon ever decided to say ""ECH, LET'S DO IT AGAIN""."
ConspiracyGrumps,3c58g9,DangerDamage,7,Sun Jul 5 02:58:43 2015 UTC,"Not So Grump and Not So Grump show with Danny and Jon   Personally, I think this could be one of the best possible outcomes of increased communication and collaboration between Jon and the grump team.  Lots of other people have talked about the dynamics of gamegrumps in terms of comedic pairings - how Jon primarily played the fool, while Arin was more of the straight man in their pairing, and how this dynamic was altered when Jon left, forcing Arin to begin exaggerating his personality and trying to be ""jokier"" in order to complement Danny's laid-back persona. In my opinion, this is a large part of many of the complaints against modern grumps - frankly, Jon was better at exaggerated, unexpected humor and improvising jokes than Arin, who mostly resorts to self-referencial humor, non-sequiters, ""gross-out"" humor, and other (frankly) low-effort jokes.  On the other hand, Danny is a nearly perfect straight man - he is relaxed, good at improvisation to enhance a joke, and has lead a generally fascinating life (Danny typically provides the 'seed' of conversations and stories for the other personality to begin riffing off of - in fact, Danny goes out of his way to do this by introducing new topics and even preparing information before hand to give the grumps material to work with during the show). His main detriments are essentially that he is almost too much of a straight man - with some notable exceptions, Danny generally doesn't craft jokes on his own, and many have pointed out that he caves in easily to Arin's opinions and points.  I say all that to say that Jon and Danny could potentially be a great pairing for a show like this. Jon is a better ""fool"" than Arin, and Danny might be a better ""straight man"" than Arin. Putting the two of them together could be comedy gold. Of course, there is the issue of conflict - Danny intentionally avoids grating against Arin, and part of the humor of classic grumps came from Arin and Jon's personalities clashing and generating disagreements and humorous situations. Hopefully in a situation where he is paired with an (arguably) more abrasive personality like Jon's, Danny would adapt and improvise to the tone of the conversation in order to keep the comedy flowing.  In some kind of alternate history, I wonder - if it had been Arin who had left the show rather than Jon, would the show have changed as significantly as it has, or would it be a case of replacing one ""straight man"" for another? In addition, would the backlash against Arin's replacement in this alternate series of events be as significant as the backlash against Jon's replacement was?"
ConspiracyGrumps,3c58g9,ogwalt,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:17:02 2015 UTC,Send this idea to them.
ConspiracyGrumps,3c58g9,Methamophosis,15,Mon Jul 6 00:03:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, since the pictures of Arin and Jon together at MAGfest made it onto the internet, supposedly proving that they are friendly again, there's been a lot of speculation. During the AMA the Grumps did on their way back home when asked to comment on it, Arin said ""We just caught up and it was nice. We are on very good terms"". After that, they started dropping a lot of J-bombs on the show, after pretty much 18 months of awkward silence. Other than this little Twitter exchange, Jon remains silent on the matter of their relationship. Arin recently commented again during their Twitch stream about how they're pretty chill now and that they have lunch every time Jon's in town. I really don't think he's lying about them being at least sort of on OK terms.  However, seeing how Arin's latest comment more or less confirms that their relationship was indeed strained and the use of ""was"" makes me think there's still some personal issues to be resolved. They do seem to be legitimately working on it, though. With that said, I'm not saying that Jon's never going to do another episode, but I do think it's unlikely that it will happen anytime soon like, say, on July 18th."
ConspiracyGrumps,3c58g9,Gazareth,6,Sun Jul 5 00:50:21 2015 UTC,God... that twitter exchange... there's just so much history and context behind it. It's weird.
ConspiracyGrumps,3c58g9,AFlyingNun,3,Sun Jul 5 02:28:17 2015 UTC,"Jon strikes me as the type adverse to lying. I do think their photos together are PR.  That's not to say that they hate each other; I'm sure they're on good terms in the sense there's no bad blood, but I also think that for Jon, he feels like he's ""whoring"" himself out for the sake of profits (for Arin) rather than for the sake of truth...that make sense?  I myself am very adverse to lying. To give you an idea, we all lie from time to time, and recently I felt forced to lie to a friend, which is something I haven't done in years. Despite this, rather than trying to perpetuate that lie as much as possible, I fully confess and admit to all my other friends that I lied, because I am ashamed of it all the same and want my friends to both know the truth and know that it wasn't something I did lightly.   If you were to expect me to lie to my other friends too in order to keep up the illusion of the lie, I don't know that I could do it. The initial lie served a seemingly neccesary and practical purpose (don't want to get into personal stuff much, but basically helped a dangerously stressed out person stay happy), but there's no purpose in doing the same with others. Doing it with others just feels...dirty. I physically struggle to do it.  My theory? Remember the timing of this: the video edit got exposed. Irrefutable proof the Grumps went out of their way to cover up a Jon mention. Did we ever get an answer as to WHY they did that? Why they put in editing hours to censor him? No. What did we get? LOOK OVER THERE, THEY'RE FRIENDS AGAIN!!  I imagine that the bad blood has died down so now neither of them has an issue with one another, thus Jon was willing to help Arin out. All the same, I also don't think it's in Jon's nature to go above and beyond and ""really sell it"" with the ""we're great pals"" image. He did the bare minimum and then he saw himself out.  Having said that, I'd bet money Jon never guest stars. It'd be uncomfortable for him, if my hunch and my theory is correct."
ConspiracyGrumps,3c58g9,Konjik,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:34:53 2015 UTC,"This is where my head's been at ever since the MAGFest pics. No bad blood at this point, but I trust Jon's stance is still the same on returning in any form. It seems the experience taught the both of them they don't work well together so while they can now start to be friendly again, collaborations are no longer an attractive concept. And honestly with all this in mind I really wouldn't even want Jon to come back. No hate to Arin either but yeah..."

No but seriously, I do think we'd get a hint if it were a possibility or were going to happen any time soon or in the foreseeable future. Jon has been visiting Cali for Maker shit, and collabs since most other big Maker talent lives there. Also I guess his parents if they still live there, I dunno.  Also, why do people keep thinking it would be a GrumpCade? GrumpCade is for pairings that aren't a ""Grump"" and ""Not so Grump"". It would still be Game Grumps if it were any mixture of Arin, Jon, and Danny. It'd only be GrumpCade if he was with someone else. Smile at that, it's a happy thought. Though I'd rather he be on with Barry and maybe Ross."
ConspiracyGrumps,3c58g9,henrykazuka,5,Sun Jul 5 00:30:35 2015 UTC,"I think the reason myself and others assume it would be a GrumpCade is because Danny is Not So Grump, and Arin wouldn't want to mess with the branding.

Further, if he did appear, it could spawn rumors of a return (and as far as we know, Jon never wants to do a let's play show again). However, they know the fans want it, so it's a possibility, which I think the majority of fans would support.

ConspiracyGrumps,3c6bp4,HappyBot9000,3,Sun Jul 5 10:24:56 2015 UTC,"My point exactly. After Jon left, it's like they had all these ideas of merchandise they wanted to sell and did it immediately with Dan. Jon focused more on playing with his best friend than making money and doing business."
ConspiracyGrumps,3c6bp4,blkraptor,6,Sun Jul 5 16:36:45 2015 UTC,"I noticed this too. At one point I think Dan called Arin his best friend, and that kinda broke my heart because I don't know that I can believe that."
ConspiracyGrumps,3c6bp4,Tom_Dynamite,6,Sun Jul 5 12:47:23 2015 UTC,"I believe it more then with Jon.   Seriously,  how often do you call your best friend ""your best friend?""  Jon would say it several times a session, even an episode.  When Dan said it once,  it felt real."
ConspiracyGrumps,3c6bp4,Tom_Dynamite,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:47:50 2015 UTC,You should see the upload on CG where Jon gets a text from Arin saying that they will be best friends forever. Jon didn't want to say it on the stream but I believe it was Ross who said it for him. I just feel like Danny and Arin just share stories and joke around but with Jon it was more genuine where they had moments and there was real emotions.
ConspiracyGrumps,3c6bp4,rxcroxs,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:00:07 2015 UTC,"I honestly never got the vibe that it is business first and friends second. Especially since a majority of the time they know each other, they didn't have a business together. There was just some collaboration between Egoraptor and NSP. The only thing I feel is that they treat Grumps more as a business now, but even that is more recent. I guess after 2 years of daily content, there isn't that much excitement involved. It felt similar in the last couple of weeks with Jon.   I really don't wanna compare who felt more like real friends, since they obviously all are or at least were good friends. It's just a totally different chemistry they have together, like it is in most friendships. Just thinking about my friends, ever friendship I have (or had) is unique in it's own way. I have that one friend I go out with, party and be stupid together. The other friend I don't go out as much with but share more personal stories. You get the idea. Thinking back, I could never say which one of them is a better friend, it's just different. I do enjoy their company all the same."
ConspiracyGrumps,3c6bp4,spicylatino69,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:44:43 2015 UTC,"I get the whole different chemistry thing but you can definitely tell that Arin is more free with doing business with Dan than Jon. It seems to me that Arin really pushes more business ideas outside of GG with Dan rather than Jon. Ex: Starbomb, Merchandise, GrumpCade, Polaris, etc. I only hate this because it puts such a strain on Dan because he has gone on record saying that he's exhausted from working on Starbomb along with GG. Dan doesn't really have a choice and it's not like him to go against Arin on it."
ConspiracyGrumps,3c6bp4,spicylatino69,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:22:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm not sure if much of this is actually forced from Arin on Dan. Especially the Polaris stuff could be them asking the Grumps to do something. As with Grumpcade, Dan wasn't even in a single episode except the live action introduction (in which he was edited in later). He wasn't even on Steam Train since forever. Merchandise is a tough call, since it already existed with Jon and I don't know how much or if it can actually be linked to Arin. With Starbomb, I'm not sure if the band was created that long after Dan joined. Could even be before. In Mario Sunshine, Arin already mentions animating it and they played that within Dan's first two months. The song or at least a raw cut, was probably already recorded otherwise he couldn't have animated a video for it. So Starbomb is at least as old as Dan Grumps. With the last album, they worked on a schedule. Hard to say if Arin is really the one to blame here."

About a year ago, Suzy compares the fans to a pile of dog shit due to questions about Jon (July 2014). 4. Suzy game gate commit (December 2014, during POZ). 5. Mii verse post cover up (December 2014). Suzy Esty Scam, started with a cover up by Suzy in February and then the truth came out in March. This was all during dan era.

WHICH YOU GOT TO PAY TO TALK SO I WAS WATCHING ALL THIS STUFF GO DOWN KNOWING PEOPLE WERE GOING TO GET PERSONAL WITH THE QUESTIONS.
ConspiracyGrumps,3blw51,Swordwithnoname,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:24:19 2015 UTC,"So it was just Arin playing by himself? Just curious. That sounds neat though, I'll have to follow. I'm always checking Twitch to see who's on."
ConspiracyGrumps,3blw51,Nikolaki8,2,Wed Jul 1 18:34:37 2015 UTC,Suzy was with him at one point but I don't know if she was playing also.
ConspiracyGrumps,3blw51,Swordwithnoname,7,Wed Jul 1 19:01:17 2015 UTC,<3 all is right with the world.  The mystery still prevails.
ConspiracyGrumps,3blw51,Nikolaki8,8,Tue Jun 30 18:03:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think Jon would say the same on the matter, but if it's true, which I hope so, then how wonderful for them. I hope Jon doesn't get bombed with that picture to force him to make a statement."
ConspiracyGrumps,3blw51,justaquicki,18,Tue Jun 30 11:56:18 2015 UTC,"Considering they've been getting lunch together every time he ""drops in town"" I see no reason why he wouldn't be comfortable with it."
ConspiracyGrumps,3blw51,grumpnotso,10,Tue Jun 30 12:27:51 2015 UTC,"I just don't know if should trust in Arin's word without knowing the Jon version, he could be lying to get some rest from it, but again, I really hope they have worked out on their relationship"
ConspiracyGrumps,3blw51,justaquicki,23,Tue Jun 30 12:44:43 2015 UTC,"That'd be pretty dishonest if he was flat out lying. I see where you're coming from but it's not like he's saying something vague like ""Yeah we're friends""."
ConspiracyGrumps,3blw51,grumpnotso,5,Tue Jun 30 12:48:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he just said something we already knew and added the lunch bit to it."
ConspiracyGrumps,3blw51,Konjik,3,Tue Jun 30 12:54:53 2015 UTC,I think if it was bullshit Jon would say something. He doesn't like lying to fans.
ConspiracyGrumps,3blw51,samsim1990,2,Tue Jun 30 22:43:27 2015 UTC,"Well, if it was bull, it may take a while for him to notice and respond.  If it is, then expect something from him in a couple days on twitter or something, but I highly doubt it's bullshit"
ConspiracyGrumps,3blw51,samsim1990,9,Tue Jun 30 23:16:50 2015 UTC,"I do too. Lots of people here have trust issues with Arin, but I feel like their view of Arin is conflicting. They say ""he wouldn't do anything to jeopardize the show"", but also think he'd lie. Arin's not stupid, it would take a real dumbass to make such a blatant lie."
ConspiracyGrumps,3blw51,Konjik,2,Tue Jun 30 23:23:00 2015 UTC,We already know they went out to eat together during MAGFest and (from Jon's reaction on thinking back on it) they had a good time together past any initial awkwardness/nervousness he may have had prior. It's hardly a surprise that they'd do it again during the few times Jon stops by in town following that.
ConspiracyGrumps,3blw51,Konjik,5,Thu Jul 2 01:08:23 2015 UTC,"And? That still doesn't explain the 1-1/2 years where he wouldn't mention jon. Come on Arin, what the hell were you hiding."
ConspiracyGrumps,3blw51,samsim1990,6,Tue Jun 30 21:28:26 2015 UTC,"It explains a lot actually. The ""was"" part shows that they aren't friends no matter what people say. The casual lunches are a little odd to me."
ConspiracyGrumps,3blw51,SrWario,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:39:29 2015 UTC,"I'll agree to that. However, they still acted like they were still friends the whole time."
ConspiracyGrumps,3blw51,omiroad,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:55:40 2015 UTC,"It sort of adds to a new conspiracy, maybe the reason Jon won't come back to Game Grumps isn't because of their connection as people but maybe someone/something is preventing them to film together."
ConspiracyGrumps,3blw51,ghost_movement,2,Tue Jun 30 23:01:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's that complicated. I think with the way the whole fiasco went down both Jon and Arin eventually realized that friends should not always be working in business together. I believe they still won't collaborate on GG projects out of principle, not out of any malice."
ConspiracyGrumps,3blw51,skysamfreeman,-1,Thu Jul 2 01:11:02 2015 UTC,"They aren't friends though, even says that."
ConspiracyGrumps,3blw51,Motherdragon64,3,Thu Jul 2 02:12:57 2015 UTC,"That's your interpretation of it, that's not the same as flat out saying they're not friends anymore. Why meet up and have a good time at MAGFest at all if you're not at least friendly? Who's forcing them to do this? There was definitely a falling out and I doubt they're close friends or anything at this point, but it's clear they're at least on friendly terms these days. Let's agree to disagree I guess."

ConspiracyGrumps,3blw51,LVL100Pumbloom,2,Wed Jul 1 00:01:28 2015 UTC,Jon has hung out with Arin before so this seems likely to me. Maybe they're just trying to be kind to us and spare our feelings though idk.
ConspiracyGrumps,3blw51,Motherdragon64,2,Tue Jun 30 16:46:33 2015 UTC,So they went from hanging out playing games with each other to some formal ass lunches. Life sucks.
ConspiracyGrumps,3blw51,NYX94,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:52:09 2015 UTC,It's interesting that each of these confirmations has been by Arin. Has just publicly stated anything on the matter?
ConspiracyGrumps,3blw51,NYX94,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:12:31 2015 UTC,"I'm so glad that everyone's cool now. But this begs the question. If they're on good terms and everything's fine, what's stopping Jon from coming back? Not like fully or anything but just like an occasional video here and there for GG or Grumpcade when he's around. Could it be that Jon REALLY doesn't like doing Game Grumps? I know a lot of people are too tied up in the Jon VS Danny thing and I think this would be a good way to please everyone. Danny stays the regular and Jon comes in every once in a while to hang out."
ConspiracyGrumps,3blw51,Arcane9000,4,Wed Jul 1 05:58:41 2015 UTC,"I honestly think it's just Jon not wanting to step on toes. I think the chapter is closed, but I wish it wasn't."

ConspiracyGrumps,3blw51,NYX94,8,Tue Jun 30 11:53:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, I know. It's been repeated quite a bit."
ConspiracyGrumps,3blw51,Gazareth,2,Tue Jun 30 12:35:23 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure he meant that he ""was"" a good friend as in that since he's in New York they don't get to talk much any more. It's pretty obvious they're still friends or friends again if there really was a falling out."
ConspiracyGrumps,3blw51,mardfet,-11,Tue Jun 30 12:42:00 2015 UTC,"""I'll just leave this here""    I remember the last time a post had that name, it was awesome."

ConspiracyGrumps,3blw51,ThisZoMBie,-5,Wed Jul 1 04:57:52 2015 UTC,nah yours is cool. I am just reminiscing about the awesomeness of that post
ConspiracyGrumps,3bmiqn,Nikolaki8,29,Tue Jun 30 12:36:59 2015 UTC,"The thing is I don't think he will top his Megaman one, and he likes to constantly improve, so there's probably a ton of lost motivation there."
ConspiracyGrumps,3bmiqn,Gazareth,20,Tue Jun 30 12:54:04 2015 UTC,"It's worth pointing out that tomorrow is the 1-year anniversary of the last one (Uploaded July 1st 2014).  Keep in mind with this sorta thing, it can be hard to find motivation for something like this for him given that:  -It's a huge project that takes a huge amount of hours to finish. So whatever free time he has to work on non-Grumps projects would probably have to be dedicated to this for months.  -People are gonna get mad at him when it's done. Obviously some people don't like Skyward Sword, but plenty really love it, too. I think it has flaws but it's far from a bad game. Arin seems to outright HATE it. Even though I'm sure he's aware of this given his last video, it probably makes working on it less fun.  -He won't make much money off it. Even if it gets 5 million views like the last one, that'd probably only amount to a couple thousand dollars with Youtube's current algorithm (Hence why he's calling it a ""passion project"" as opposed to a regular work project). So if he's going to dedicate a huge amount of time to something he can't justify as supporting his livelihood, he probably wants it to be on something he's highly motivated to do. Not something where he's gonna spend hours and hours on trying to articulate ideas, capture footage that represents it, and possibly require tons of re-doing when stuff doesn't work out.  -He has other stuff he's doing at the moment that he can probably get paid more for and have more of a return-on-investment in terms of non-monetary rewards for him.  Aaaaaanyhow, I'm interested to see whatever it is he does instead. I kinda wasn't all that interested in hearing about a Skyward Sword Sequelitis. Also Arin changes his mind all the time so he might go back to it at some point, too."
ConspiracyGrumps,3bmiqn,Kewl0210,5,Tue Jun 30 14:16:23 2015 UTC,"-He won't make much money off it. Even if it gets 5 million views like the last one, that'd probably only amount to a couple thousand dollars with Youtube's current algorithm   How it works is that unless you pump out a ton of videos daily (like Game Grumps), have a constant schedule (Every Xday, Yday, And Zday a video is uploaded), or pump out a video once or twice a month but is SUPER popular and watched over and over (like JonTron), then YouTube isn't pulling in the big bucks.  Arin almost never uploads his own content now and a majority of his videos are either updates or Starbomb promotion. Besides the more publicity he's getting by showing a Starbomb video, I bet his channel doesn't bring in enough to warrant wanting to work on a huge project."
ConspiracyGrumps,3bmiqn,Iron_Hunny,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:20:24 2015 UTC,Well those people are jerks. I mean I love Skyward Sword but I respect his opinion.
ConspiracyGrumps,3bmiqn,Motherdragon64,12,Thu Jul 2 03:24:01 2015 UTC,"I just think that the backlash from the Zelda Sequelitis discouraged him quite a bit. His last Sequelitis seemed less constructive than the Mega Man and Castlevania videos and seemed to have a goal of dumping on Ocarina of Time and saying how overrated it is, rather than objectively analyzing the game design changes."
ConspiracyGrumps,3bmiqn,radioactivechimp,9,Tue Jun 30 20:48:45 2015 UTC,Then why isn't Barry editing grumps
ConspiracyGrumps,3bmiqn,ArabianAftershock,4,Wed Jul 1 06:39:08 2015 UTC,I miss his editing...
ConspiracyGrumps,3bmiqn,CreeperMug,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:58:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah...what does Barry do now? He's occasionally on Grumpcade and Steam Train, but that's not too frequent."
ConspiracyGrumps,3bmiqn,RiversBromo,20,Fri Jul 3 03:10:10 2015 UTC,"Interesting how he called it a passion project, but at the same time states that he doesn't have time to do it. Passion would mean that you're enthusiastic and uncontrollably dedicated to something.   Maybe he's just choosing his words poorly but I have a hard time thinking that he's passionate about sequelitis if he doesn't even want to make it. I don't mean to call the guy out but why not just say ""I'm not into it anymore""?"
ConspiracyGrumps,3bmiqn,arachnophobia-kid,24,Tue Jun 30 13:09:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I can relate to the type of personality Arin seems to have. He loves doing artistic things like sequelitis, Awesome series, etc, but lacks the skills to properly manage his time and motivate himself to do them without a deadline being forced on him. I'm the same way with my creative writing. I've been writing for ten years now, and have only ever finished two short stories, and never submitted anything for publication. My lack of actual production isn't a sign of me not really being passionate about it, it's a sign of being terrible at self-motivation and time management."
ConspiracyGrumps,3bmiqn,xwatchmanx,5,Tue Jun 30 15:07:39 2015 UTC,"This exactly. As a music producer, sometimes motivation is hard to find cause it's like, I love listening to my finished projects, how fucking cool they sound, but when I haven't even started them, all I'm thinking is ""ahh, so much fucking work I have to do to get things how I want"". So I'm sure Arin has really high standards for how he wants things done, is just finding the motivation, that point where you're like, alright let's fucking do this, and you're set unto do this huge task.  It's sad a lot of people don't understand this and just go ranting on Arin like he's a sellout who cares about doing the easiest thing for the money, it's just excuses, bla bla bla. Specially for people that have motivation problems, in real life, berating them just gets them deeper in the hole."
ConspiracyGrumps,3bmiqn,theboatleft,2,Wed Jul 1 15:28:10 2015 UTC,"I'm with you there, man"
ConspiracyGrumps,3bmiqn,SpacePilots,0,Tue Jun 30 17:08:19 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean, it could be just semantics but I figure the definition of passion would include being highly enthusiastic and motivated to do the thing you're passionate about. Otherwise I'd call it a hobby or something like that."
ConspiracyGrumps,3bmiqn,arachnophobia-kid,15,Tue Jun 30 16:28:20 2015 UTC,"After the backlash of the latest episode I could easily see him being discouraged from making another one. On an off topic note, what does Barry actually do anymore now that it's confirmed that Arin isn't developing Sequelitis atm?"
ConspiracyGrumps,3bmiqn,MooseBurgers511,2,Tue Jun 30 13:36:00 2015 UTC,He's doing game design stuff.
ConspiracyGrumps,3bmiqn,arachnophobia-kid,0,Tue Jun 30 19:16:46 2015 UTC,I guess he's just on the show more often.
ConspiracyGrumps,3bmiqn,arachnophobia-kid,5,Tue Jun 30 13:42:30 2015 UTC,It doesn't really seem like it. I fail to see how occasionally being on the show is enough for him to sustain himself financially.
ConspiracyGrumps,3bmiqn,JavelinTF2,2,Tue Jun 30 13:43:44 2015 UTC,"Who knows I guess. Maybe he's still doing a lot of stuff in the background. I mean I'm not gonna pretend I know everything that goes into their production. I do a let's play as well and it's a fair amount of work, much more than it looks like on the outset."
ConspiracyGrumps,3bmiqn,sjhunter6311,3,Tue Jun 30 13:48:33 2015 UTC,"I don't know anything about the background to any of this, but I wouldn't be surprised if Barry let Kevin take the editing reigns so Barry could put his editing work elsewhere.

ConspiracyGrumps,3bmiqn,arachnophobia-kid,2,Tue Jun 30 15:21:26 2015 UTC,He literally CAN'T do it because he's way too busy working his ass off making sure the other Grumps have time and supplies to work on their passion projects

I'm sure what Arin described are valid reasons, but I think there's more to it than that. I just think he's more of a low-key SJW or something and likes to not-so-subtly support feminism by choosing to be female at every turn. I'd assume Suzy has something to do with it. He started randomly spouting feminist facts on KKG recently."

ConspiracyGrumps,3bnro1,8bitrevolt,2,Sat Jul 4 15:35:24 2015 UTC,"I pretty much exclusively play as female characters in e.g. WoW.  The reason behind that is because I like lean characters. It feels like you are playing the underdog and it's a lot more satisfactory than playing a big brute who looks too powerful.   I think that males are depicted as insanely muscular in many games, and if there's no option of changing body type I gravitate to the female character instead."
ConspiracyGrumps,3bnro1,Samzapp,5,Wed Jul 1 03:44:02 2015 UTC,"I play female characters pretty frequently because the character design is typically better. In almost every Pokemon game, I play the girl character (Dawn, anyone?). In MMOs I will usually pick girls.  That's not to say I won't also play a male character. It really depends on what kind of game I'm playing."
ConspiracyGrumps,3bnro1,Motherdragon64,8,Wed Jul 1 08:32:47 2015 UTC,"Splatoon is a perfect example of this as well. From the moment the game was revealed, the Inkling girl's design completely captured my attention, whereas the Inkling boy's design was just...meh."

I try to keep from speculating about the gay/trans/ stuff too much. When Arin was doing the mocking voice and said ""I JUST REALLY WANNA BE A GIRL YOU GUYS"" Danny was just going softly ""It's ok, It's ok."" which felt like he was being preemptively supportive. Also the entire room became interested in the question, Suzy even pointed it out.   I believe that everybody can pick the opposite gendered characters in videogames for a variety of reasons. I'm sure there have been many girls who loved Super Mario Bros but put absolutely no thought into the fact that Mario is a guy. I'm similar ot Arin. I play as girls, but I don't do it all the time and I don't talk about it to the point where it's something people become curious about. Sometimes they have better clothes and character designs. I also grew up with Sailor Moon and so much other girly things too. But I'm not trans.  How people identify to male and female characters in videogames and different genders are extremely interesting though and I doubt it's straight forward. So who knows."

ConspiracyGrumps,3b671f,Samzapp,17,Fri Jun 26 08:14:52 2015 UTC,Most of the people at /r/GameGrumps didn't feel the need of closure most of us here have. That's why we have our own sub.

""It's been briefly mentioned, but if you'd like a good idea of why we feel the way we do, look at any other subreddit or forum dedicated to content creators.

ConspiracyGrumps,3b671f,TaylorCulosis,21,Fri Jun 26 08:27:53 2015 UTC,And you don't think that applies to this sub? Seriously?
ConspiracyGrumps,3b671f,SadMcDsworker,18,Fri Jun 26 09:12:32 2015 UTC,"In some cases, yes. But the very first rule of this sub makes it very contrary (and the fact that people actually follow it). No one is posting yearbook photos."
ConspiracyGrumps,3b671f,TaylorCulosis,5,Fri Jun 26 09:42:00 2015 UTC,"Most people follow it.   It's an amazing double standard that never ceases to amaze me,   ""This guy made a post that offends me and it has six upvotes, I hate /r/ ___Grumps,""  All of the subs have crazies. Crazies upvote other crazies and suddenly the entire sub is cancerous to everyone outside, while the other 5/6 of the subreddit is either mia or flushing them out. It's happened here, there, and everywhere else especially concerning Game Grumps and the thousands of differing fan opinions.   The thing is, /r/gamegrumps is at 70k and growing -- you can't just say that every person there follows this ""praise the grumps fuck the haters"" ideology while anyone (and it's probably a good 0.01% of the subreddit, and that's being generous)  saying that is either in the negatives or deleted. If someone says something about the state of any Game Grumps subreddit that you don't agree with, then chances are that there are people on both sides of the argument.  I like you Taylor, I really do, but sometimes I just can't agree with you."
ConspiracyGrumps,3b671f,Jaffil,-16,Sun Jun 28 03:58:27 2015 UTC,It's a sub dedicated to finding answers to personal questions neither party wants to answer. This sub is far worse in that regard.
ConspiracyGrumps,3b671f,SadMcDsworker,19,Fri Jun 26 12:11:41 2015 UTC,"Judging from everything he's ever said on the matter I get the feeling Jon wouldn't really mind if people legitimately found out. Arin seems to have a huge problem with it, Suzy as well. No one else seems to really mind. In fact everyone else appears to just feel awkward they have to be involved by proxy.  It seems like Jon only really signed an NDA not to talk about it, even though at times he has wanted to, out of respect for the man he used to admire as a friend whom he worked with on projects for years.  Besides what I read from the PsychicPebbles quote is more along the lines of him disapproving with fanaticism.  I'm going to be honest here, while conspirists may toe the line when it comes to finding out about events regarding specific information and related details, no one i this sub is digging too deep. No one is asking legitimately how large the grumps dicks are or intimate questions regarding Arin and Suzy's married life. No one is having real discussions about how badly they actually want to be in the D Club just so they could get a look Arin's penis.  Curiosity is one of the best traits that humans have, it's one of the primary ways humans learn. This sub is about curiosity despite that some people are obsessively curious. The main sub is about pure obsession. For god's sake they don't even allow fans of the show to talk about anything that's not Game Grumps; most fan-subs allow fans to discuss non-related things with other fans."
ConspiracyGrumps,3b671f,LVL100Pumbloom,6,Fri Jun 26 13:58:02 2015 UTC,"Right, that's why this sub was created, for people that felt they needed closure on the whole ordeal, something neither party could give to that people.  If you don't like it, you can just leave because this sub was meant for other people."
ConspiracyGrumps,3b671f,theboatleft,-13,Fri Jun 26 15:46:25 2015 UTC,Doesn't make it less creepy. And I'm here because it's morbid interest.
ConspiracyGrumps,3b671f,SadMcDsworker,2,Fri Jun 26 16:26:23 2015 UTC,"You want to see actual creepy? Go back to the main sub and take off the blinders.  This is what creepy is. The main sub is full of stalkers and it's deemed socially acceptable by them as long as you're not being negative towards current Grumps (Oh but being negative towards Jon is completely fine, they absolutely hate Jon over there if you haven't realized by now), however exposing what many people felt to be shady business practices was considered an invasion of privacy? No. These people dig up old, non-relevant information about the Grumps personal lives and pasts before Grumps and act like it's normal to do that. That kind of shit would get you a restraining order normally, maybe more.  This is what PsychicPebbles meant, this is why so many people are ashamed of the Grumps fandom, this is why people call the sub a cancer, the people in that sub are why the Grumps feel uncomfortable interacting with fans.   This sub is harmless compared to the main sub. Even without the main sub to compare to it'd be harmless."
ConspiracyGrumps,3b671f,LVL100Pumbloom,-5,Sat Jun 27 12:17:40 2015 UTC,"You say ""take off the blinders"" as if I think the main sub is any better.

ConspiracyGrumps,3b677n,PokemonFan2000M,5,Wed Jul 1 07:42:59 2015 UTC,"Really there are a few facts that can be cobbled together from watching the old videos that immediately disprove some of the theories. Here I'll pull one out of my ass right here from a randomly selected video:  Game Grumps does not inhibit Jon's ability to make JonTron. ""Game Grumps is very easy to make.""  Not to mention there are some really popular/well thought out theories that aren't represented/are misrepresented/are lumped in with different theories that don't have the same idea behind them there.  A real list would have to include something like 100+ options since you're already including some of the more abstract ones."
ConspiracyGrumps,3b677n,LVL100Pumbloom,3,Fri Jun 26 20:57:53 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I only compiled most that stood out, but I don't know all of the options unfortunately, It would be cool if we managed to list the rest off and I could compile them into a new poll. We probably won't get the truth out of data alone, but I put it together mostly to see which theory seemed likely to everybody. So far the different ideologies leading to a falling out is the most likely scenario next to leaving to move to NY and focus on Jontron which was a solid 2nd all the way through."
ConspiracyGrumps,3b677n,LVL100Pumbloom,2,Fri Jun 26 23:49:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah I really like the idea of seeing the spread of what theories people believe most, I just felt the need to comment how few were represented, I'd glad you didn't take it as an insult.  It's a great idea, we just need to find a way to compile all the theories and flesh it out more. It needs categories with different specifics in each, for one. I don't think Strawpoll is going to be able to handle a questionnaire with this many angles. Know what I mean?  Part of the fun of the theories is how diverse the details of theories that share the same general idea are to me."
ConspiracyGrumps,3b677n,Tom_Dynamite,11,Sat Jun 27 00:08:34 2015 UTC,"I remember, around half a year after Jon left, that I was pretty annoyed by the comments on Youtube. There were so many fake comments with ""I didn't watch Game Grumps in half a year. Where's Jon?"" I answered to one comment and made up a whole bullshit thing, just for the fun of it. Whenever I saw a comment about why Jon left, I always used my comment as an answer for a couple of days.. It basically came down to Jon hitting Suzy. I know it's a stretch but I always wonder if I had anything to do with the fact that this theory came into existence.   True story, btw."
ConspiracyGrumps,3b677n,LVL100Pumbloom,6,Fri Jun 26 15:06:01 2015 UTC,"Most likely, Jon hitting Suzy just went to other things, Jon had sex with Suzy, Jon did SOMETHING with Suzy. Then people started saying Arin hit Nicole and I'm just confused. So I put both choices so everybody can choose. I'm honestly impressed with how much votes this got. 321 is pretty big. The majority believes it was a clash of ideology between Arin and Jon."
ConspiracyGrumps,3b677n,HarlodsGazebo,8,Fri Jun 26 19:40:10 2015 UTC,"Before the split I used to joke about Arin secretly being gay and him and Jon being such great friends partially because Jon would satisfy Suzy for him to help him keep her as a girlfriend to cover up the truth from everyone else.  It wasn't as funny when Jon left. Then it went back to being funny for a while saying Danny was doing it for him now.  Then sometimes I actually started feeling like it might be true, I don't like to think about it much anymore."
ConspiracyGrumps,3b677n,Zero_Heart,2,Sat Jun 27 00:14:27 2015 UTC,If anything it's Barry satisfying the goose. Have you watched the steam trains with Barry and Suzy? They get along better than Arin and her seem to.

ConspiracyGrumps,3b677n,freddyjasonmyer,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:44:31 2015 UTC,"It was mostly because when Jon left, the Game Grumps brand expanded tremendously, spanning newer and more shows on their channel and having so much more guests from other channels, though I did make a mistake as the ""Jon didn't want to be a brand to game grumps anymore"" Was pretty much the same thing just more detailed. A lot of mistakes on this poll though, I would like to re-do it but with better clarity and more theories."

I thought they were mocking Jon or something. I gave Game Grumps a chance after that, but I never watched Steam Train. I dropped GG and I never even gave Steam Train a chance up until about the time I decided to check out the channel again.

Well, the video was about getting drunk. Perhaps Jon doesn't want people to see him that way? Perhaps Jon doesn't want people to think of him as a drunk?  Jon was featured in a ""Drunkstravaganza"" with Continue, which would imply that he has no problem being filmed while drunk. However, that was back in October. Perhaps Jon has changed his mind since then.  What happened between October and now? Meeting up with Arin at a convention. What would a meeting with Arin cause Jon to think about? The reason why Game Grumps broke up.  So, why did the Game Grumps break up? Because Jon was getting too drunk too frequently? Did Arin ask him to stop getting so drunk because it was unprofessional and causing him to get hangovers which prevented him from filming Game Grumps in a timely fashion? Did Jon get so drunk on June 13th 2013 that he couldn't attend a panel the next day, which was the last straw for Arin? Did Jon simply blow up at Arin because he was so drunk that night? Getting drunk could have been the cause of the breakup for any number of reasons, or a combination of reasons.  And now, a video about getting drunk vanishes from Jon's YouTube channel.  Hmm."

ConspiracyGrumps,3b5zc6,semperverus,9,Fri Jun 26 11:26:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was fake, but I don't really feel it proves they're friends. All it shows is they're both entertainers with some respect for each other. Entertainers who don't get along and aren't friends with each other get roped into taking pictures together all the time.  Them having a talk could just have been them saying: ""Listen, I don't hate you."" ""I don't hate you either."" ""Okay good talk.""  We still only have the faintest idea about what happened officially, that's why the sub still exists.  Edit: For example on entertainers, John de Lancie and William Shatner aren't friends and don't really get along, de Lancie told me himself at a con while making jokes about offering to sign William Shatner's autograph for everybody who was disappointed that Shatner bailed halfway through the day. However my father still as a picture of them shaking hands and smiling with their hands on 14 year old me's shoulders somewhere. They did it to make fans smile, not because they're friends."
