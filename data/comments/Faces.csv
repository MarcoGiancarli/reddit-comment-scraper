Most of the time I can't even really put my finger on what the issue actually is, but it's there, consuming every moment and it's hard to get past that feeling, but I always do. Push yourself when you're feeling your worst and reach out into the world; Good shit tends to happen.  I always find making music and art to be the quickest way to center myself, but yeah, even that sometimes doesn't help and I sit there laying on my bed, with my head hanging over the side staring at the carpet, every second slower then the last.  It fucking sucks, but whatever, if you're dead you'll never find out if it gets better and you owe it to each and every possible instance of your future self to keep going, because what if one day you wake up and everything is fucking golden? Your future self is gonna be pissed if you didn't wait around long enough to find out."

Please... I know you're tired of hearing this, but every phase will pass. Another phase may come your way, life happens, but always remember it will pass. You will never have a chance to see the other side if you take your life before your time. Always give yourself the benefit of the doubt, at least a chance to see what life may have in store right around the corner."

I can tell you from experience that it takes a long time to reshape your way of thinking. Some people need drugs, some need therapy. I've been lucky enough to be able to kind of go at it alone.   Just remember that you're not always the way you think that other people see you and that you're more than just your looks. And really, from here, what you look like isn't anything to be upset about either."

Got it right the second time after I left it in for an extra 6 hours and washed it out with a bit of vinegar water. Turns out the blue only stays for about a week before turning green anyway lol.

I can tell you that a good man likes a natural woman, and yes, blondes are very attractive to most men, that is why other women want to be blonde.  To me anyway, a pretty, natural blonde, with no piercings or tattoos is my kinda dream girl!  But you do what is right for you, after all, you have to make yourself happy above all to be happy in life.  Best of luck to you!"
