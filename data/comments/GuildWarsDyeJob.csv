GuildWarsDyeJob,3dwr4i,xcjacob30,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:21:42 2015 UTC,Depends on the circumstances.
GuildWarsDyeJob,3dwr4i,Tjaja,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:27:35 2015 UTC,"Depends on how you define best. Not everyone likes the same look.  Generally, rare dyes look better because they bring out detail.  Matching two colors is based on the color wheel. A primary color matches the secondary color made from the other two primary colors. The primary colors in this case are red, blue and yellow (not green). Black and white go with everything and each other.  Follow these basic rules, experiment, and be objective, and you'll find something that you like."
GuildWarsDyeJob,3dwr4i,Tonkarz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:22:55 2015 UTC,"For sylvari, I love some combo of mischief, midnight yew, maroon, midnight rose, and amber/enameled emblaze/lava/flame. Usually I end up going midnight rose for the primary color, maroon for the accent, and flame/amber/enameled emblaze/lava for the ribbon and third accent. But it really depends on what class and race you are and what preferences you have for colors."
GuildWarsDyeJob,3dtbj3,AticusCaticus,2,Sun Jul 19 06:38:15 2015 UTC,"You don't have any pictures of your character standing still, only a lot of pics of various attack animations, which makes it hard to see the armor. The guardian effects support a Holy Fire/Wind theme, but I wouldn't be able to tell what theme you've been going for. Maybe that's just my impression, could you add a pic of your character standing still to see the armor better?"
GuildWarsDyeJob,3dtbj3,lurking_strawberry,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:51:20 2015 UTC,"There are screenshots of the idle animations per weapon, those are standing still.

When they came out I just had to theme my engineer after them :D  The toxic goo dripping from the weapons is affected by movement and coupled with the lithe sylvari character and no butt-cape, it's a fun look to play and run around in.  GW2Style page with skins and dyes  Shout out to /u/lyriumnug and their wonderful Scientific Engineer set that inspired me!"

The wiki armor and outfit galleries might be useful if you haven't seen them already. Maybe Heritage or Duelist. There doesn't seem to be any good options for females. The human T2 chest came to mind but you'd have to create a human.

GuildWarsDyeJob,3c6r9b,senhorpanda,5,Mon Jul 6 03:56:26 2015 UTC,"IMO the quiver messes up the look. As a guardian you don't use arrows, and there's some overlapping going on with the quiver, which is a huge fashion no-no. I mean, just look at it- you've got a quiver of arrows cutting through the handle of a greatsword... It's too busy."
GuildWarsDyeJob,3c6r9b,ElliotDelBargo,4,Sun Jul 5 17:30:21 2015 UTC,"I desagree, its gives a ranger look (not a gw2 ranger), something like dungeons and dragons.

GuildWarsDyeJob,3buiij,apologeticCultist,3,Fri Jul 3 01:27:53 2015 UTC,"Medium armor's going to be very difficult, since most options are longcoats. Light armor would be a lot easier than medium, and Mesmer strikes me as a better fit than Ranger."
GuildWarsDyeJob,3buiij,indign,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:57:44 2015 UTC,"Mesmer is definitely the best option, with the floating greatsword autoattack.  Probably best to use the Peacemaker's (asura t3) GS even though it's the wrong color. The shape seems better and it's got that big circle on it."
GuildWarsDyeJob,3buiij,apologeticCultist,3,Thu Jul 2 19:55:25 2015 UTC,"Floating autoattack, slamming it into the ground, summoning clones - yeah, all pretty perfect for Red."

GuildWarsDyeJob,3b9naj,Eitth,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:01:01 2015 UTC,"Sure thing! Though this is a really expensive dye set if you don't already own them. I was using a bunch of gem store dyes on purpose, since I hadn't been able to incorporate one of the sets (Electro) into many dye schemes and most of the new colors they've released lately have been very bright and saturated. If you work with more muted colors, you can achieve a similar effect for less cost. You can use this tool to find similar-looking dyes that are cheaper.  I'll list the dyes in order, first the top row of the square and then the bottom row. So, for a piece of armor with 4 dye channels it would look like this:  1st 2nd  3rd 4th  Head - Glint's Isolation, Electro Lemon  Shoulders - Electro Blue, Electro Blue, Electro Blue  Chest - Electro Purple, Pastel Violet, Pastel Blue, Electro Lemon  Hands - Electro Lime, Glint's Ambition, Glint's Ambition  Legs - Electro Pink, Violet Breeze, Purple Breeze, Electro Peach  Feet - Aureus, Hot Pink, Electro Pink"
GuildWarsDyeJob,3b9nuu,Ratfeast,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:03:12 2015 UTC,"Very original color scheme. I like it a lot.  I think no helm looks best, but the helm from the same set as the shoulders is good too (forgot their name). Also consider the T3 helm, it's a cool skin."
GuildWarsDyeJob,3b9nuu,Blue-C,2,Sat Jun 27 18:32:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks, as you can see from the comments, they prefer my beautiful purple locks to any helm.  The Shadow of the Dragon Helm is the one you see in picture #2."

GuildWarsDyeJob,3b9koo,Dewman66,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:31:27 2015 UTC,Helm - Reading Glasses  Shoulders - Tricksters shoulders   Chest - Vestments of the Lich  Gloves - Wrappings of the Lich  Leggings - Flame Legion Pants  Boots - Exalted Boots  Colors are nothing special Red/Black mixture with Starry Night hair color with Red streaks.

I wouldn't downvote it because I love the dyes and I can see what you're going for but in my mind it's quite not there. I'm not even done messing with my mesmer's armor and he's been 80 for 3 weeks now and all I've been doing is trying to get the right fit for the fight.
GuildWarsDyeJob,3b3b9z,Swuell,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:02:58 2015 UTC,"Care to elaborate?? I think the OP would want to know why--if not I do--since there's gotta be some reason if you're OCD (aside from just not liking it) since you were talking about the look ""[not being] quite [there]"" yet.  I would definitely want to know since you seem to have ideas. :)"

The heavy Arah pants are the most similar to the cloak, but they're still not really a cloak and you'd have to change class."

GuildWarsDyeJob,3adsqq,RevelOrange,4,Fri Jun 19 08:24:49 2015 UTC,"my only advice would be to get more dyes - both of your looks are only using two colours and it has no depth to it. search the TP for some (cheaper) dyes in the same shades, greens, oranges, blues, pinks and add those for highlights to create some nuance. i like the bubblegum idea you're going with for your necro, though!"
GuildWarsDyeJob,3adsqq,zmajka,1 point,Fri Jun 19 10:54:09 2015 UTC,"if you are using two main colors, don't use the same one as the base and the other for the accent on all pieces.  Instead reverse that for some pieces.  So make the bottom mostly pink with a little blue, and the top blue with a little pink.  Or you can have most of the outfit be pink, but have the boots have blue as the primary color.  In general even if you are going for the same basic color, having some of the pieces be a different shade makes them stand out and makes the outfit work better.  Darker shades for the boots, lighter shades for the shoulders, that sort of thing."

On these pants it's dark green on the fabric and light green on the metal details (these parts share dye slot).  You can probably get a similar effect with high contrast dyes like the Gemstone ones (Flame and frost, Enameled...) if you want another color. There are a few non-Gemstore ones too."

GuildWarsDyeJob,39zkxw,irlkayle,4,Tue Jun 16 01:48:51 2015 UTC,"You have kind of a steampunk dwayna vibe. If that's what you're going for, I would suggest the Noble Mask for your face, and the dwayna backpiece for obvious reasons.   As far as colors go, I think the dwayna outfit has a slightly lighter blue, maybe go for the Blueberry dye? I'm going solely off the dye thumbnail since I don't know how it will look on leather armor.   Just some thoughts off the top of my head, but the outfit looks great! I love the Magitech skins."
GuildWarsDyeJob,39zkxw,neon_cleatz,2,Tue Jun 16 03:00:01 2015 UTC,"i love dwayna so i was overjoyed by the release of the dwayna regalia. if anet follows their recent gemstore trend, we'll see a set of dwayna weapons next month (fingers crossed!). i usually wear the dwayna outfit but i wanted my regular armor to match as well. i had bought magitech for my engineer but decided it looked really good in these colors.  feel free to tell me if any dyes look wonky or if you think different shades would be better-suited. i would really like to stick to the blue-gold color scheme. originally i tried to match the colors to the outfit's default colors but it looked way too garish for my tastes, especially on leather.  dyes used:  country teal for the main color daffodil for the trim on the jacket, shoulders, etc ancient silver for the metal on the shoulders, gloves, and legs illumination for the ""glowy"" parts on the gloves and shoulders antique bronze for the boots daffodil for the headpiece"
GuildWarsDyeJob,39zkxw,Swuell,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:52:47 2015 UTC,"The only thing I would say is break up the monotonous color scheme by either going with another color (one piece or trim piece) to bring focus to the overall piece (character + armor) or go with another shade/tone of those colors you used; depending on which piece you're applying it to and how it could range from just a variation of 1 of the shades of dye you used to possibly 2-3. Just depends really on you. But those are my suggestions via constructive criticism.  Since the overall color scheme looks nice to me, its very dark heavy though, that's for sure. So I'd go with a lighter or warmer color (depends on the color you use as that's really color specific on whether it's going to be warmer but darker or warmer but mute or lighter but colder or etc) to bring out the overall color scheme.  An example would be like since you used antique bronze for boots you should of used a semi similar color or the same on the headpiece, shoulders, arms, or body piece so that the eye would be drawn back to the color and it wouldn't look off. But yeah that's just an example of what I was talking about since you already seemed to have the right idea, you just need to fully complete it.  Hope that helps and that what I said even makes some remote sense.  Edit: Forgot to add you did do a really nice job of including your tattoo makequp as well (though that's not always required) but in your case you used that to level the field of view, which is nice. I didn't see a headpiece though unless you were talking about the tattoo (or mask if its a mask, I can't tell on my tablet).  And is this gem store only by the way? This armor looks sweet!"

GuildWarsDyeJob,39xyt0,irlkayle,2,Tue Jun 16 01:41:56 2015 UTC,I put in the maroon for that little extra accent. Especially at night because I glow dark red. Almost the same color as maroon.

GuildWarsDyeJob,39xyt0,Arafax,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:35:10 2015 UTC,The face and hair look really good. The dyes are great but I think the purple could be better. It blends in too much with the skin and if it wasn't for the red there wouldn't be much contrast. I suggest trying a more vibrant and/or darker purple and see if you like that better.

My original ranger looks very tame http://i.imgur.com/zSkNtDp.jpg She was also a Purple and Red kind of girl. While I like her every details, she didn't leave any remarkable impression or whatsover. That's my motivation to change her look, riddled with many ""busy"" details, borrowing many glowy pieces to create an impact. An easy solution could be getting a mix of Carapace and Luminescent and 80% of the work is done because how incredibly well they look on sylvari. However, I love both the Icy Diadem and the Zodiac for their transient and ephemeral quality. I know they are not everyone's cup of tea but they are my inspiration of this look and I wanted to make it work. Hope you understand."

The hairstyle is nice too, I don't see it a lot. Overall I think the dyes are great and the red is a nice touch, but I think it would look more consistent with the Carapace shoulders instead of Luminescent. Otherwise there's a bit too much blue on the upper body in my opinion."
GuildWarsDyeJob,39xqed,Swuell,2,Tue Jun 16 07:58:23 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much. Your comment is very insightful. I think I was a bit greedy choosing the Luminescent Shoulders hoping that the pulsing purple color will reflect her glowy pink hair. However, dyeing Luminescent pieces proves to be a more difficult task then I had initially thought. I changed it to Carapace piece based on your suggestion, subdue its color and the blue streamlines much better from her Crown to Torso to Leggings and Boots. The concept is her glow as a blue energy seeping through her body and manifesting itself as a protective chest piece. I also changed the gloves to a more pinkish purple color to match with her hair and backpiece (both are glowing in the dark). I'm a bit hesitated about this change as it may be too matchy-matchy. I grow to love the dashing red color in her every animation although there is no reason behind it..."

GuildWarsDyeJob,39wf4q,Blue-C,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:39:37 2015 UTC,Instead you could always try green and yellow. And vary between what tone and hue you specifically want for each. Such as dark green with a light yellow or green with a darker yellow. Etc. And I think you should be able to do more than one typea of yellow/green unless I'm wrong which should help.
GuildWarsDyeJob,39wm0u,Ratfeast,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:55:39 2015 UTC,Please help me decide where to go with this.

Once you find something you can preview it in the in-game wardrobe through a bank or crafting station if you want. Usually a good idea if you are planning to use parts from different sets because sometimes things clip badly.  GW2Style can also be good for inspiration. I searched medium armored Asura for you.  Can't suggest anything specific because I don't know your taste. Most sets can work with the rifle I think. As for the dyes; pick your favorite dye/color and then look for others that look good together with it. The dyes' rarity doesn't matter a lot usually, and you definitely don't have to spend a lot of money on them to look good. Some expensive ones are amazing though, like Charred (brown) on metal armor. The difference between ""normal"" and expensive ones is mostly that expensive ones make the textures of the armor stand out a lot more."

GuildWarsDyeJob,39d9zc,Philalive,4,Thu Jun 11 00:08:29 2015 UTC,"Hey Phil -  Best place to start is to decide on a theme you like.  For instance, this look is pretty good for a desert bandit/punk.  So if that is what you want, I'd say you're doing well.  Grab a rifle skin that looks like you could fix it with duct tape and fire it with the chamber half full of sand and you're golden.  If, however, you'd like to change it up, I would start by choosing some armor, colors, or source material that appeals to you, and we can recommend something to help you get there!  Some dyes you might like for the current set: Oxblood is a great red with lots of hilight potential for leather or cloth. Antique Silver is one of my favorite metal accents, and looks great next to the new-ish yellow, Perseverance. Really fantastic leather color. Other great accent colors: Acrid (Green), Midday (Blue, great for asura crystals, matches Aetherblade glow very closely), and Vincent (Purple, but very dark. Best with lighter base colors)"

After a lot of back and forth, I ended up using mostly the same armor as before. I switched out her boots for Aetherblade ones, which look nicely practical and sturdy, and changed the colors to something better suited for adventuring in the jungle.   I am really loving the Scientific weapons and got her the rifle and pistol - to my surprise, they look like they were made to go with her go-to mini, the Watchwork Moa! I skipped the shield for now because I found it too large and angular-looking, but I may change my mind on this one. For now, I am using the Etched Bulwark - it is slightly smaller and looks more organic, which is certainly suitable for the jungle, but is the same color as the Scientific Weapons. I also considered the Glyphic Shield.  Lastly, I decided to use the Antitoxin Injector back item which goes well with the new weapons.

GuildWarsDyeJob,390udc,chazmarius,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:17:50 2015 UTC,I think it's great. I like the natural looking dyes and the weapons are fitting. I don't care that they are low level skins.
GuildWarsDyeJob,390udc,Blue-C,2,Wed Jun 10 12:58:39 2015 UTC,Yeah i'm the same way. The whole point of transmutation stones is to forget the levels associated with the gear and just focus on the looks of it.   There are several low level skins that I feel are superior to their high-level counterparts.
GuildWarsDyeJob,390udc,Blue-C,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:54:56 2015 UTC,Yes! Two of my characters use the focus from the same skin set as your weapons (Steam Gizmo). Leaves a cool trail and costs a few copper on the TP.

My sylvari knows that other races start too see them more and more as threat/enemy, so she tries to appear human-like / technology focused. Sadly thsi also makes her appear more like Scarlet, but it is  still better than wearing cultural clothes at these days.   She knows that deeper parts of Maguuma will not be friendly to anyone, so she is training with weapon kits to burn down that tainted jungle and its inhabitants... and if that fails she can always use other race's fallen copses as minions.

Second: Arms are rather plain in contrast to the 3rd choice, and the chest's vertical lines works against the various diagonals in the other armor pieces.  Third: Works the best at fitting with the other armor pieces in creating a theme but the extra detailing contributes against this when looking up close."

GuildWarsDyeJob,38w03o,Arahmitz,2,Sun Jun 7 08:16:32 2015 UTC,"The main thing that needs to be fixed is the contrast in style from the upper half to the lower. On their own, both are great armor styles but do not not work together at all. Since you want to keep the chest I'd recommend a change of leggings.   Monocle and Asura T3 chest/shoulder work well together to satisfy the upper half's look. You can optionally change the hair styles to one of the new Asura hairstyles with the glowing accessories to match the chestpiece's arm-piece in a similar manner the Asura T3 headpiece does. This is up to personal preference. Council Ministry's Gloves matches very well with chestpiece as well.  Now for the lower half. I'm an advocate for armor-set mixing (to have a much more original look) so I would myself steer away from Asura T3 leggings. For recommendations I'd change the leggings to one of these: Apostle Leggings, Cabalist Leggings, Country Pants, Inquest Breeches, Priory's Historical Pants, or Vigil's Honor Leggings.   Boots will depend on which legging you choose.  Send me a mail with your final look, I'd love to see how it turns out =3."
GuildWarsDyeJob,38w03o,lolevy,2,Mon Jun 8 03:42:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the answer. What do you think about colors? And which hair would be good ? I though about the bandana deadlocks :s  EDIT  http://gyazo.com/c671f54d019ad20e732adf9a933938ed  here's the look, still looking for better colours and hairstyle :P"
GuildWarsDyeJob,38w03o,lolevy,2,Tue Jun 9 13:20:26 2015 UTC,"Looks like it's coming together. Now I recommened just fiddle around with the wardrobe for each piece of armor to give some of your own personal flair to it. When you find something that just clicks check it out and try to work for it if you need gems or dungeon runs etc.  For the hair this is all up to your own preference what to choose or whether to change it. My Asura uses the hairstyle you currently have as it is my favorite. I only recommend a new hair style with an accessory because it would round off your upper head area along with your Monocle. If you do choose a hair style with an accessory, I would advise you choose a neutral color (black, gray, or white) for the accessory unless your very sure of color choice you end up with."
GuildWarsDyeJob,38w03o,lolevy,2,Tue Jun 9 23:13:47 2015 UTC,For colors here are some that I've experimented with and loved (Based off the Asura T3 Chestpiece):  Main: Midnight Ice or Brick  Lining: Redemption/Illumination  Leather: Black    Main: Black  Lining: Pastel Honey  Leather: W/E    Main: Heirloom  Lining: Turquoise or Redemption/Illumination  Leather: Green Tint or Black(if you go with Redemption)    Main: Maroon  Lining: Nickel  Leather: W/E    Main: Winter  Lining: Wintergreen  Leather: Black    Don't forget to switch the dyes here and there until it feels right and good luck =3

Hopefully it's only because it's a text post (link posts are quicker to open with RES and on mobile, so they probably get more views).  All the armors are great and the color schemes too, especially the 1st one. I love how you included lots of different dyes and they work really good together. Makes it look more realistic when everything doesn't have exactly the same color. The dyejob on the 3rd is great as well. The orange and green are interesting and original choices. The red glove details is a nice touch. I only think the boots look a little off but maybe that's just me. 2nd is good but not as detailed so I don't have as much to say about it. You seem to have put a lot of thought into all of them though, so good job!"
GuildWarsDyeJob,38r05d,Blue-C,2,Wed Jun 10 19:19:31 2015 UTC,"I have no idea how to do a link post :(  RE: the boots - I don't like the sharp edges at the top but there's not many options for slimline, form-fitting boots with the metallic plating to go from the thigh down the leg which also dyes similarly. Aside from those, the only other options I'd possibly consider are Prowler (doesn't dye the same) and Glorious (doesn't really fit the theme). Maybe in HoT there'll be more options.  http://imgur.com/GzJnNPa - with the Prowler boots"

GuildWarsDyeJob,38ext0,Dranztheman,4,Wed Jun 3 19:38:11 2015 UTC,He looks like a butcher. I actually think the mask looks good with this theme. Maybe dye it with darker colors if you don't like the pattern. I'm curious about why you don't like it.  Only thing I could think of after looking through the wiki gallery is the the kinky blindfold (Seer armor) but I'm not sure it would fit as well.  Another idea is the Grenth hood. Imagining this skin on a butcher themed character like yours reminded me the pyramid head from Silent Hill; creepy and humanlike but obviously not human. Even your color scheme is similar to him :) Maybe the Dry Bones mask could be used for the same effect but if I remember right the spiky shoulders and the scarf come along with it.  Or hide the headpiece entirely.  I don't know if this is what you were asking for... That wiki gallery is pretty useful for this sort of thing though - look through it.
GuildWarsDyeJob,38ext0,Blue-C,3,Wed Jun 3 22:20:32 2015 UTC,"Pyramid head was one of the characters that inspired this look. More or less I was looking at input, or Ideas concerning the head piece. I have found that with a red color the mask is red, and black. Straight black meshes into my characters hair too much.  Dry bones would be great, but the shoulders come with the mask, and that has always been a deal breaker to me (same for whisperers light). The hood of grenth... I really wish it was still in the gem store, that would be great.  Other thoughts are just glowing eyes (wraith mask, or glints glowing eyes)."
GuildWarsDyeJob,38ext0,Blue-C,3,Thu Jun 4 00:04:37 2015 UTC,"Well the Grenth Hood will likely return sometime, in case it's one you really want (limited time skins have returned before). Maybe when HoT comes out or at Halloween.  About red on the mask: You are probably using a red dye that gives a lot of contrast. Some dyes like Blood and Heirloom do that. If you want the pattern to be red use a separate non-contrasty red on it. Red or Strawberry both give the pattern a vibrant red. If those are too dark try Coral. I don't know what shade you are using so maybe these won't work, but you get the idea. Sort your dyes by hue to make them easier to find.  I remembered the starter mesmer masks. Maybe you'll like those: Fanged Dread Mask, Harlequin's Mask, Phantasm's Mask.   I think the eye skins are good options too. I especially like the Wraith one."

GuildWarsDyeJob,37yp30,l4zyhero,2,Sun May 31 15:00:53 2015 UTC,I really like the gold and blue colours. Shoulders and helmet are T2 human?  Control - Shift - H removes the hud by the way :)

I love all 3 the same in terms of style and can't pick a winner.  Thief looks like scorpion which is awesome. Warrior I tried to go for a Pact Commander look and took me the longest to make (its a mix of vigil helm, AC shoulders/arms, CoE chest, Vigil Pants, Phalanx boots). Mesmer I wanted something that would look like its easy to fight melee in (so not a big ass dress). Guardian is just all vigil with a Heritage helm, not many armor sets I like for Charr Heavy but this is one of them. Necromancer also looks pretty badass but thats only because of the grenth helm.   I also have an ele and a ranger. Ele is just some random berserk armor dyed red, nothing special about it. Ranger had a pretty good looking set but then the wardrobe system was introduced and now she has some cluster fuck of an armor setup. Before I had some Tier 1/2 cultural armor mixed in on her but its gone now, not even in the wardrobe."

With that said, the bottom-left choice is my favorite.  I think you could improve the look considerably with more complex dye choices, but am unable to determine if that was part of these previews (out of shot in the preview window).   Best of luck!"
GuildWarsDyeJob,37ra2t,Tyrill,2,Fri May 29 20:20:45 2015 UTC,"Bottom-left was my initial choice too. After I started getting this outfit together, however, I found out that the Carapace pants are really REALLY shiny... That kind of changes things since the shoulders and gloves are really matte, and it makes it look really awkward. I'm leaning more towards the top two options now since the pieces there are more shiny.  As for the dyes, these are just placeholders to get the ""shape"" of the armor down.  I'll keep trying to put something together, thanks for the input though!"
GuildWarsDyeJob,37ra2t,fritzywiggins,2,Fri May 29 21:54:00 2015 UTC,"Top right's my favorite.  The layered, shiny metal of the shoulder pieces is more consistent with the design and sheen of the gloves and chest/pants.  I like the top left too--it has a more rugged feel to it--but I prefer the sleeker look of the top right outfit.  I don't like gloves on the bottom two.  Too matte."
GuildWarsDyeJob,37ra2t,fritzywiggins,1 point,Fri May 29 22:02:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input!  I added a couple more shiny shoulder options in an edit, any of those seem more appealing?"
GuildWarsDyeJob,37ra2t,Sabawoyomu,2,Fri May 29 22:26:28 2015 UTC,"Top right and top middle both look great. Top right's flashier, though I personally like the more subdued look of top middle.  The sleek look of the bottom left seems mismatched with the detailing of the rest of the armor."
GuildWarsDyeJob,37ra2t,The_77th_orange,2,Sat May 30 03:21:07 2015 UTC,I prefer the top right or the bottom left. I really don't like shoulderguards that are larger than the characters head!
GuildWarsDyeJob,37ra2t,Blue-C,1 point,Sat May 30 12:18:16 2015 UTC,I think you should go with the top left or bottom right. Both look great and really work with the dark Knight kind if look the chest brings out. Nice armor set!
GuildWarsDyeJob,37ra2t,Samitrace,1 point,Sat May 30 05:42:44 2015 UTC,"Shoulders:  T2 > T1 > starter > the rare skin > Vigil > Heritage - For more metal and shinyness on the upper half of the body. Also because I love the shape of the T2 ones. Gloves: T2(?) > Phalanx - For more metal/shinyness but also because the Phalanx ones look really bulky. I think they could work fine with big shoulders like the T2 or starter but not with the rare shoulders like the bottom left of the 1st pic.   Basically I'd go with top right of the 2nd pic.  That chestpiece is really cool by the way, I love the collar thing. The chest/pants combo is great but I hope they won't look mismatched in-game because of different shaders or something. Also dyes might look different/darker on the chest than on everything else, but hopefully it won't be too bad."

GuildWarsDyeJob,37r0kh,stupidbookah,1 point,Sat May 30 10:11:11 2015 UTC,"When you make a comment on a character the creator gets a notification, so it's worth a try. But you might have to wait a while.  Or just open character creation and compare skin colors with their character selection screen picture (4th). Change GW2 to window mode in the settings, make the window smaller and put the picture next to your game. The color looks gray to me, maybe slightly green."

GuildWarsDyeJob,37lsfj,Blue-C,2,Thu May 28 19:26:03 2015 UTC,The pattern on the leg shares the same color with the feather/leaf skirt. I would be quite overwhelming to dye them yellow gold. Thanks for the compliments ^

GuildWarsDyeJob,37n3ih,Kexmannen,2,Thu May 28 21:08:31 2015 UTC,Have you tried a pale yellow for the hands? Or a bright orange?
GuildWarsDyeJob,37n3ih,Tonkarz,2,Fri May 29 06:50:54 2015 UTC,"Maybe include more colour contrast, with some darker tones on the armour sections or some lighter tones on the fabric/cape? Also try to have similar coloured dyes on the different sections to have a consistant dyejob, e.g. Dark blue ( iron dye ? ) on the outer armour plating and a grey on the under-armour and then all a light blue ( blue ice ? ) on all sections of cloth. For the hands in question, maybye try to have a colour which stands out from the blues, maybe something very dark or light, contrasting heavily from the armour underneath. You could try out a different colour from the blues, having something contrasting like gold, or if that dosent work, try a more blue colour maybye. However if it is the lich king, maybye you could dye green shade dye, or something similar, to make it look like a ghoul's hand? Hope I helped ! :)"

GuildWarsDyeJob,37lcoh,heavyscythe06,2,Thu May 28 13:42:37 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd add some light blues, and get rid of most of the browns. Or, at least use the browns on a less dominating area.  Remember that Lara Croft did wear fairly normal clothing (blue shirt with khaki shorts) under her exlorer's gear (which was pretty much just leather holsters for her weapons).  So feel free to play around with it more, but try minimizing the brown and adding some lighter blue. If that still doesn't work, maybe try replacing the brown with a sharper gray, like pitch.  That's all I can think of, really. The green and orange look good."

GuildWarsDyeJob,36zvhk,Caleddin,3,Sat May 23 15:36:38 2015 UTC,"I have a preference towards the ""regular sized"" races when I'm playing a melee-ish class like the thief. It's because the actual range of, say, your dagger is the same across all races, which means that, for asura, you can technically hit someone who appears visually well out of the range of your tiny arms, but worse, for norns and charr, they can't hit someone who is nonetheless being visually clipped by the end of the blade.  Thus, I keep to casters/ranged classes for my characters of unusual size. That's not to say it's impossible to use a martial melee class that are an unusual size, I just find it takes some time to get used to the range weirdness.  Personally? I'd go with a sylvari of either class. In part, it's because I love the sylvari racial armors (plus the armors from Twilight Arbor are awesome). It's also because I find the slightly more reserved natures of the sylvari to make more sense, at least for the thief. I ran a norn thief once, but it struck me as odd to have such a boisterous character lay claim to being stealthy.  I also main a sylvari ranger, so here's a few screens of her: http://imgur.com/a/f1DGj"

At least in my preview it looks ok: http://i.imgur.com/SUxLFwY.png  Tip: to find colors matching skin    I took screenshot of character. Opened in photoshop and used eye dropper -tool to see color hex codes of different areas of skin. Like this: http://i.imgur.com/jcRi3TP.jpg Then I put hex code to this ""gw2 closest dye matching -tool: http://www.pendiongaming.com/gw2/dyesearch.php   Extra tip: when modifying character put your UI size to to Largest in GW2 options (second tab).

GuildWarsDyeJob,36pp8f,Viking_Drummer,1 point,Thu May 21 18:01:51 2015 UTC,"The male version looks awful. Dude has a beard though.   You mean that the male Trickster shoulders look bad? If you mean the character your choice should be easy :)  I like them both equally but one might have better potential than the other if you're planning to dye them differently than this (not all black). In that case I think the male would be slightly better because his chestpiece is more detailed and is probably easier to dye than the female's. The female Trickster's shoulders are really nice though and can set the theme (plus her hair is great), so it's not an easy choice :)"
GuildWarsDyeJob,36pp8f,Blue-C,2,Fri May 22 00:40:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the shoulders are what I'm talking about.   It's very difficult to find chest and leg light armor pieces that don't clash or clip too which is a big issue.  I'm a big fan of the female version of the drybones set. Generally I'm not a fan of a bunch of skin showing but compared to some armor (underboob thieves) it's pretty modest. I barely have any armor to begin with, should cover what I can!"

I'd recommend taking yourself over to the bank and checking out the wardrobe, select a piece of the CoF armor you really like and start building parts around it, play around with dyes a bit more, make some highlighting colours, like using dark blue, gold, and light blue or something to give your armor some definition, and finally, take a picture during the day, and closer to the character so that people can see what is actually going on with it.

GuildWarsDyeJob,365nf5,oAJLEEo,2,Sat May 16 11:11:09 2015 UTC,"My asura necro uses the wizards hat. While its cool, being unable to dye it kinda limits the colors you can really go with so keep that in mind.  I had Heritage Shoulders, Council Ministry Vestments and Winged Pants all with the Violent Tint dye as the main dye color. I also found the Devout Mantle to be suitable for the wizard-ish look, or even a solid dyed Shoulder Scarf for a more cloth appearance for shoulder skins. The T3 Cultural armor for humans can look nice as a robe-like bottom.  This is all from the point of view of a male character though, I don't have any females. Hope it helps give you some inspiration.  http://i.imgur.com/KiFdc92.png Here is an idea of what it may look like all put together."

GuildWarsDyeJob,35p4x1,mrmyco,2,Tue May 12 21:11:14 2015 UTC,What mini is that?
GuildWarsDyeJob,35ql1j,speedmen24,3,Tue May 12 18:20:13 2015 UTC,"Just some quick advice, I would add what race and gender you as there are major differences in some skins and of course access to certain pieces being cultural ;)  I made a cowgirl gunslinger norn female engineer a while back and the Privateer Hat was a must. I hid the shoulders and went with a medium trench coat. Im at work an cant get on to confirm, but I think I used the Seeker Chest Piece or the Rogue Chest armor.  Boots and pants are pretty much all whatever you want them to be. There are some cool skins that look like they are stitched hide and the Krytan set has a skull belt buckle. I went with something simple on the gloves that didnt go above the wrist. As for the pistol, that is entirely up to you what you want to duel wield. My gunslinger was a super tall norn woman with a pink cowboy hat and 2 Lovestruck Pistols  Good luck!"
GuildWarsDyeJob,35ql1j,CanvasMath,2,Tue May 12 19:21:29 2015 UTC,"First of all, I want to make sure you know about the wardrobe function at any bank.  You can preview every skin. Also, cowboy can mean lots of things.  This is like a vest and pants, while This has a big trenchcoat.  I can't find any good cowboy hats. They all look piraty to me.  Aventurer's Scarf, or Marauder Helm are good for a western bandit look.  I think the Rogue coat is the best, while  Buccaneer coat, Leather coat, Mist walker coat, Rascal coat, Rubicon coat, Scout's coat, Stalker coat, and Swindler coat look good too.  Hands and pants are kinda minimal, and lots of the boots look good."
GuildWarsDyeJob,35o9jh,gwaith,3,Tue May 12 04:06:13 2015 UTC,I think that last one looks best.
GuildWarsDyeJob,35o9jh,The_77th_orange,2,Tue May 12 04:07:31 2015 UTC,The only solution is to make alts for each color combo!

GuildWarsDyeJob,34qo0z,PulseFlow,5,Sun May 3 18:38:44 2015 UTC,"I took two stabs at this, one attempt in medium armor and the other in heavy.   Medium: Noble Shoulders, Council Watch Chestguard, Stride of Koda, and Scout's Boots.  Heavy: Avenger's Armor, Grasping Dead Legguards, Vigil's Honor Grieves.  The colors I picked were Crimson Lion and Black, but those can easily be substituted for shades that are more accurate and you'll be able to dye individual parts rather than just a whole channel.   I couldn't find anything that was really ""yeah this absolutely 100% looks like Archer"" so you might want to look around for alternatives if these don't look good to you (for example, the heavy boots could also be Rampart Warboots). And, obviously, your hair will be white and not peach haha.   Hopefully that was a bit helpful, and good luck!"

It's still a WIP, as I'm not sure what I want to do for the shoulders (I wanted the Stalwart Shoudlers, but that's obviously out of the picture, I might go with the Norn T3), I'm not 100% set on the colour scheme, and I don't have weapon(s) picked out yet.

GuildWarsDyeJob,34hb4c,Blue-C,2,Fri May 1 09:57:07 2015 UTC,"There doesn't appear to he a handle. She just grabs it by the middle.  I specifically didn't touch the shoulders because I loved the specialization akin as well. XD  EDIT: Looking at the wiki page, the hourglass focus is held by some of the metal that frames it as seen here"
GuildWarsDyeJob,34hb4c,Blue-C,2,Fri May 1 13:33:17 2015 UTC,Thanks. I think the way it's held looks good enough in that pic. I really wish it was held more like a lantern though. And if it had one handle on each side...
GuildWarsDyeJob,34hb4c,ReLiFeD,2,Fri May 1 18:56:37 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest taking a screenshot in a different location, the Heart of the Mists kinda washes out the colors."
GuildWarsDyeJob,34hb4c,cr0nage,1 point,Fri May 1 13:15:48 2015 UTC,I almost did but just felt lazy. Good call though.
GuildWarsDyeJob,34hb4c,Blue-C,2,Fri May 1 13:33:55 2015 UTC,"The hourglass is a nice touch, but aren't they going to be adding the shield for this specialization?"
GuildWarsDyeJob,34hb4c,Ferllys,2,Fri May 1 13:59:31 2015 UTC,There's still going to be weapon switching so his 2nd weapon set could have the focus.
GuildWarsDyeJob,34ecqw,ShirokamiSenpai,3,Thu Apr 30 13:34:35 2015 UTC,Why is every shot far away from the character? You uploaded 8 pics and not one is close to your character. Dude. :-/

GuildWarsDyeJob,34edfa,PlatinumMad,1 point,Fri May 1 00:50:30 2015 UTC,"Everyone's tastes are different and I don't know yours so I can't suggest anything.  Look through the wiki gallery and see if you find some parts you like. Use parts from different armor sets if you don't like any whole set.  GW2style.com is good for inspiration too (basically like this place but easier to search and more popular nowadays).  About dyes, start with your favorite color. If you want one color to stand out you use an opposite color (or slightly opposite) on other parts of the armor. Or you can ask for help again if you can't come up with something that satisfies you :)"
GuildWarsDyeJob,34g4tp,klimuk777,1 point,Thu Apr 30 21:29:51 2015 UTC,Looks great! First time i've seen the ram backpiece actually fit in good
GuildWarsDyeJob,34g4tp,gw2multi,1 point,Fri May 1 08:15:27 2015 UTC,Thank you and stuff.   I would like to know why people downvoted this thread into oblivion because I am just curious.
GuildWarsDyeJob,34g4tp,justtheharshtruth,2,Fri May 1 11:14:48 2015 UTC,"Likely because your combination of armour is very overused, looks skimpy for the sake of being skimpy, nothing really pops out as unique besides the Ram backpiece, and your facial sliders just look like the defaults which is very bland.  If it's the look you want that's great and keep on using it! It's just that most of the posts that get attention here are the ones that are unique and eye-catching, rather than the same look you can see on 70 different human female thieves in Lion's Arch."

GuildWarsDyeJob,349fmm,MooCube,3,Wed Apr 29 10:33:00 2015 UTC,The black dye is a bit boring but I like what you're trying to do and the choice of weapons. Blue horns was a good idea.
GuildWarsDyeJob,349fmm,Blue-C,3,Wed Apr 29 20:13:41 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback. I agree about the Balthazar outfit. Do you have any suggestions for dying that? It's pretty much one uniform colour all over
GuildWarsDyeJob,349fmm,Blue-C,3,Thu Apr 30 00:05:14 2015 UTC,"Maybe this will give you some ideas. Since you have lava under the whole armor and a big sword on fire I just went for different blues to balance it out with ""ice"". Didn't know the metal was all one single dye and most of the brown-ish dyes I tried (even Charred) didn't fit, but I included one anyway. Was harder than I thought. I suspect they would look a little better in-game.  Dyes (metal and cloak, all horns are Pastel Blue): First one is Sincerity and Pastel Winter. Second is Burnished Steel and Winter Breeze. Third is Glacial Sky (expensive) and Sunset. Last is Pewter and Winter Breeze. If you want to add the ""water element"" make the cloak a deeper blue like Summer Sky (I think it looked okay). If you want a darker metal try Iron or Blue Shade.  By the way sort dyes by colors (click the little gear icon to the right of your dye list). Makes it a lot easier to find proper dyes.  Anyway it's your character so use whatever you like. Shouldn't matter what others think."
GuildWarsDyeJob,349fmm,Blue-C,3,Thu Apr 30 03:39:30 2015 UTC,Thank you for the thoughtful and well-considered reply!  I liked the third one... then saw the price of Glacial Sky... hmmm :)
GuildWarsDyeJob,349fmm,b0red,1 point,Fri May 1 02:38:11 2015 UTC,Yeah... But it is a very nice dye on all armor I've tried. Placing a buy order instead of buying instantly can save you some gold if you still want to get it.

GuildWarsDyeJob,344l2e,KaidaCat,1 point,Tue Apr 28 06:38:24 2015 UTC,"I like the colourscheme on your human thief. Most of the others are very dark and it's hard to see the details. I think it looks good on some characters, but not all of them. Especially the sylvari could look better with some more colour.   Most of the heavy armor characters look pretty similar, which makes a good look somewhat boring. The scarf on your asura looks badly matched, so I'd use a lighter shade, a completely different colour or a shade of black matching the chest."

Hopefully this one is as unique as the first I made. I was absolutely blown away by the reception I received and I'm very grateful. This one gave me a bit of a struggle. There is a graphical glitch right by his left thigh that I can't hide without compromising the angle of the shot. Also the gloves were a nuisance to nail down. 75% of all gloves would clip through the arms and the other 24.5% weren't long enough for my taste. Frankly, It's ugly and I'd love for a number of those clip issues to be fixed but until then, I give you the Snowbrushed Sylvari.  Fun Fact: Calfskin is the same color as the Dye- Remover."

Dyes are all the same except the purple, which is Shy Violet. The shoulders are Shy Violet, Wine Shade, Midnight Fuchsia.  I'm not very happy with the purple and I rushed it a little. Also I forgot about your staff so it won't match very well :( Hopefully it will give you some ideas though.

GuildWarsDyeJob,33tfjo,CptHappyPants,1 point,Sat Apr 25 16:44:45 2015 UTC,Celestial is aout 90g. if your looking for a cheaper alternative you could just get white for closer to 30g.
GuildWarsDyeJob,33tfjo,Blue-C,3,Sat Apr 25 16:47:42 2015 UTC,"Even cheaper options for a ""white"" are Fog (light gray) and Blue Ice (very light blue, almost looks gray, at least on my armor). Both cost way less than 1 gold.  Anyway do you really need white? I imagine the suggested white + Redemption dyejob is supposed to look kind of angelic and your armor doesn't seem to have that theme (by the way I love the tattoos). Personally I think your current dyejob is better than that. I think the metal color you have is great. I would just replace the black with some warmer colors like brown or red. You won't look exactly like the hammer (I assume you don't want that) but I don't think it will look out of place. Its bright yellow color will fit the armor and it will stand out nicely because of the glow.  Also, finding dyes is easier if you sort them by color by clicking the little gear icon in the top right corner of the list of dyes."

GuildWarsDyeJob,33mvyr,Novaeish,4,Thu Apr 23 21:12:23 2015 UTC,"I spend a lot of time creating the perfect armor for my characters, sometimes weeks, and it always starts before the character is even created. During that time I change things a lot, just like you, but in the end I tend to stick with one look because I'm so happy with my work and don't want it to go to waste.  On many chars I have 2 sets though, one for damage and one a bit tankier. However I rarely use the tanky one in actual combat, only in towns :( I try to convince myself that armor is not a waste because I might need it in Heart of Thornes or WvW. If you can't decide between 2 sets I recommend doing this. Exotic armor with most good stats combos isn't hard to get anyway.  Nothing wrong with changing armor regularly though. If you get bored quickly and enjoy to create new sets, why not? Just keep doing PvP and you'll have enough transmutation charges."
GuildWarsDyeJob,33mvyr,Blue-C,3,Thu Apr 23 22:08:49 2015 UTC,"I generally have at least 2 sets of armor for each character, my ele has a celestial set and zerker, my warrior has zerker, sentinel, and knight, etc. so I at least have 2-3 looks per character I can switch between so I don't get bored."

I do alter it as time goes by as new armor parts become available to more closely match the mental image I have that fits the set, so they do evolve over time.  However, once I get to a point where I am happy with the character's look, I generally try to keep it with it."
GuildWarsDyeJob,33mvyr,axisaver,2,Thu Apr 23 22:15:16 2015 UTC,"I generally go through everything all at once until I settle on what I think is the ""best"" look.

My girlfriend on the other hand seems to be unable to hold just one opinion on what looks best, and changes her look on a weekly basis."
GuildWarsDyeJob,33mvyr,MadePancakesOnce,2,Thu Apr 23 22:58:26 2015 UTC,All of my characters have at least three sets of armor. I would hazard a guess that 90% of everyone that posts here is similar in that regards.

It is funny, but after my Thief, the Necro is my next favorite to play, despite it playing almost 180 away from how my thief does.  The dash of blue on the legs of the thief, however, was intentional, though aesthetic taste differs from one to another.  Without some vibrancy, it looked rather dull.  That, and given the light show that Bolt generates, in combat the bright blue tends to be far less of a distraction."

The Primordus (TP) is another (cheaper) option. Also this ascended one might work too.  Purple or blue weapons could look good too I think. The Corrupted (blue icey from the TP) weapons might give a nice contrast to the lava on the armor while they kinda match the skincolor/headpiece, for example. You could look like a heavy armored elementalist!  Check the wiki gallery if you haven't already. You might find something you like.  Personally I don't mind the legendaries, just throwing some ideas at you. Especially the scepter is fine imo."

A suggestion: Maybe add some more different dyes to the black parts, like some greys, a dark purple or a dark metal looking blue. I think the character looks much better in the preview window where you can see some of the armor's details, but in-game it gets a lot darker and too black IMO.  Also I like that you didn't pick one of those really vibrant crazy looking hair colors. This dark purple one is perfect."

You yourself admit that the details are obscured, and the reference picture you posted has a lot of lighter colours. You will probably not be able to replicate it 100%, but it's better to try and look similar than just be a big black blob basically.  I'd suggest looking at the resources in the sidebar and figuring out which colours mix and match well enough to get a good dark purple effect."
GuildWarsDyeJob,33eyf6,starvinmartin,3,Wed Apr 22 00:52:29 2015 UTC,"First time trying to deck out a character, looking for input. Super scrubly.

The darkness obscures the detail, but the detail is really hard to replicate from what I've seen.

GuildWarsDyeJob,33eyf6,CanvasMath,1 point,Tue Apr 21 23:51:58 2015 UTC,"I love your look.  There has been a lot of hate for the darker dyes for hiding or obscuring armor details, but that totally defeats the purpose of dark dyes.  Dark dyes make you dark. That's the point. With the recent release of the shadow dyes people are paying good money to look dark. I enjoy really well thought out dye combinations, but sometimes those blur into the scenery and the details are lost. Its like spending a ton of time in the character creation on a face only to have it hidden beneath a helmet. Sometimes details just don't matter.   A mysterious looking dark figure running through town or WvW catches my eye. The subtle purple you used from the shadow purple really imitates the feel of the Tormented Spear and I think your look captured the intended character really well. The little bit of fire on the shoulders is nothing compared to the awesome profile that they create.  I wouldn't do anything different to your look. Own it cause it looks awesome."
GuildWarsDyeJob,33eyf6,Blue-C,0,Wed Apr 22 17:57:27 2015 UTC,"The armor is great. I think the shoulders' fire is fine, it's so small, but it's your char.  About the dyes: Like others have said yours are way too dark. The reference pic has several different purples (I see 4), try looking for similar ones (of different shades, some more vibrant than others. Doesn't have to be exactly 4). Sadly I doubt it's possible to fit in gold properly, but purple could be enough? I understand that you want to hide the details because they are a bit different from the robot dude, but wouldn't the right colors make it more recognizable? Especially when it's a female character. Just my opinion!  Either way I think your character looks good. The armor is quite accurate to the picture and I can't think of anything that should be replaced (check the wiki gallery if you want to be sure). Even if one can't recognize the reference your armor looks light and everything matches well. I love the helmet!"

Basically, there are three type of material in the game, each giving a different hue of the same color:   Metal/plate Leather Cloth   Light armors mainly use cloths, medium leather and heavy metal, with some exception sometime."
GuildWarsDyeJob,33at6b,Chabb,1 point,Tue Apr 21 00:43:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the hood and the chest are both leather."

GuildWarsDyeJob,33at6b,Blue-C,2,Tue Apr 21 01:45:05 2015 UTC,"The material explanation is only partly right from my experience. It's not uncommon for cloth on different armor sets to dye differently, so if that happens to you it is not a bug. Always been this way. Idk why, maybe the textures of different sets have different properties or something. I have no idea how this stuff works.  When this happens you just have to find one more dye for the item that is dyeing weirdly. The starter thief hood is a very dark item, I don't even think you can get it completely white. So try lighter dyes of the same color from your wardrobe until you find the one that comes closest to the color you want. Try the locked dyes too, and don't forget the other categories like orange and yellow (you never know). This is the only solution, and usually I can find something decent."

GuildWarsDyeJob,338ts4,Blue-C,3,Mon Apr 20 20:18:27 2015 UTC,What dyes is it? Shoulders doesn't fit in but overall looks cool and unique.
GuildWarsDyeJob,338ts4,Blue-C,2,Mon Apr 20 18:32:28 2015 UTC,"Yea reading my mind with the shoulders.   I picked them since they display color nicely and since I think most of the medium shoulder skins are poop. I'm totally taking advice though! That's why i love posting here. Got any ides on what shoulder pieces could cover the same area and show off nice color?  And I forgot the dyes, but will post them when I get home from work!"
GuildWarsDyeJob,338ts4,Blue-C,2,Mon Apr 20 19:35:44 2015 UTC,The TA armor looks great with those dyes. I don't think the shoulders fit in very well though.
GuildWarsDyeJob,338ts4,demongnomed,2,Mon Apr 20 18:27:43 2015 UTC,I've have a crises with the shoulders.   I chose those since IMO they show color really well and have really nice dye channels. Other than that i cannot for life of me settle for any medium shoulder piece skins. I'm about to just not wear shoulders at all on for this outfit.
GuildWarsDyeJob,338ts4,demongnomed,2,Mon Apr 20 19:34:20 2015 UTC,Since it's a Norn I'd get either the TA shoulders or hide them. There are no other planty ones and I can't think of anything else.  Maybe you can use the Aetherblade shoulders with another set? For WvW or another build?

GuildWarsDyeJob,339hs4,KFblade,2,Tue Apr 21 23:25:43 2015 UTC,"Canthan, Elonian, or Orrian theme.   that begs the question of what exactly the difference in clothing aesthetic exists/existed between Orr, Kryta, and (human controlled) Ascalon."

GuildWarsDyeJob,32p9bj,ThisIsRaccoon,3,Wed Apr 15 18:58:46 2015 UTC,You mind sharing this trick? Looks badass!
GuildWarsDyeJob,32p9bj,CanvasMath,6,Wed Apr 15 19:22:27 2015 UTC,"Gaze of the lich, light armor head piece, has 3 dye channels; 1 for the hood, 1 for the skull part, and 1 for the eyes of the skull. If you use shadow abyss dye (the darkest black dye available) and dye the whole skull black, it looks like a hollow hood."

There was an amazing post with a light male sylvari doing the branded theme, and he was using the T3 chest and AC pants. Maybe the T3 chest could work for you too? Unfortunately I can't find the post at all..."
GuildWarsDyeJob,32pnvx,Blue-C,2,Thu Apr 16 20:13:53 2015 UTC,"Hmm... I'll try to find that sylvari post, but I had looked around a lot and there weren't many. I was actually trying to avoid using the cultural armor since it feels like so many people use it and I kind of want to be different. But I might just give in.  I kind of agree that my current version is VERY purple. Any thoughts on other colored dyes that would look good for a branded theme?"
GuildWarsDyeJob,32pnvx,Blue-C,1 point,Fri Apr 17 00:12:43 2015 UTC,"It seems like the post I mentioned is deleted, cause I looked for it a lot... Basically he was using T3 with AC pants and some other boots. He had similar colors to yours and the character was nearly the same. Anyway, using cultural armor together with regular armor is really not that common so I don't think you should worry about being unoriginal if you want to try that.   About dyes... Maybe more different grays. Maybe some dark and grayish green, brown or blue. Hard to think of colors that will work with the theme I admit. Maybe imagine what colors he was wearing before he was corrupted, and get washed out gray hues of those colors? plus your purple of course."

GuildWarsDyeJob,32lkvx,Rhymey,3,Tue Apr 14 19:38:15 2015 UTC,"I...tried oTL  I made these assuming you want them to be human. Ran into several problems, mainly the unavailability of their hairstyles and hair colors. Labeled them accordingly in the album  Lumina was tricky since she's meant to look youthful. The freckled face is actually gets that effect better but the presence of freckles ruins it. Her hairstyle (or a good clone of it) is also missing. Remedi was tricky coz of the lack of long hairstyles. I would've tried it on a norn to see if they had one that resembles hers but I don't have a norn character and currently don't have an extra free character slot to make one. Illua also suffers from the hair problem. I tried out 3 hairstyles that sort of bring that effect but I don't think they're that good. Her exact shade of hair color is also absent. Same goes for Lucina."

GuildWarsDyeJob,32lkvx,okonomide,2,Thu Apr 16 10:49:40 2015 UTC,"There are not any similar hairs for Lumina, Illua and Remedi. You can have similar dye combinations and hair colors but that's the most you'll get.   For lumina maybe Incarnate Light Armor leg piece and Phenoix Light Armor shoes would go well. Conjurer Mantle light shoulder piece would fit the feathers on her. There is no asimetric gloves in game. Afaik there is not a similar chest piece but you can find something goes well with incarnate leggings. The Most importantly you can not create flat characters at all. There is one side tail hair but it's too short and one of the newest hairs is long enough but it's not a tail.  Illua wouldn't even look similar even if you tried. Maybe that incoming Annise outfit would fit somehow and you can have same hair color but there is not a similar hair yet. You can get some very short hairs though.  There is no capes but you can create Lucina I think. There is an hair very similar but you might find it shorter than hers. Some pants under Strider Tunic would complete half of the look. I'd use Whisperer Secret Leggings but it's up to you. For shoes Magitech Boots would go well. There is no big sleveed gloves but I'm sure you can find something similar. One of the incoming swords for Heart of Thorns is almost same as hers. It can be also doable with some light armors, even better but as far as I remember her skills, mesmer wouldn't fit her theme.  For Remedi, armor is somehow doable but hair is not. There is not any hair like that or anything resembles. There is also no similar staff. Even If you compromise about these parts there is only one resembling skirt in game and it's an outfit. Corrupted Orrian and Conjurer light leggings can be made ressembling but it's a far shot. There are plenty gloves and chest pieces in game similar to hers."
GuildWarsDyeJob,32lkvx,Obliu,1 point,Tue Apr 14 20:38:41 2015 UTC,"I dunno about the face, but I'd say go ranger for Lucina. Looks like medium armor would fit best, and ranger gets sword. Ascended chest would work pretty well, off hand."

If so, this is normal for ""special"" armor with animations, and there isn't really much armor that works the same way. The only stuff that comes close is probably Sylvari cultural armor or Zodiac, but I don't think either of them gets close enough, and Zodiac wouldn't match anyway."

There's also the possibility for trauma a little lingering corruption from the dragons, maybe he has a malicious streak that he has to surpress sometimes (he doesn't need to straight up go into ""evil mode"" or whatever just perhaps be a bit overzealous when handing out punishments to things etc.)  He could also have a hero/villain complex to a degree, either he feels like he has to atone for his past actions or feels like he isn't worth anything because he couldn't convince his comrades to leave the dragon(or maybe he did but he was the only one to escape alive burdening him with survivors guilt.) there's so many possibilities to go further with this sort of character idea  As for our friend Roland Lanister that's a tough one as i've never watched or read game of thrones so I can't really help you, if you get a base idea though id be happy to run with it ^"

What I don't like is how much skin the chest shows when the sleeves run all the way down the arm.  My advice: You're looks is awesome, but add some gloves. Your arms and hands look so bare with no gloves. Try something people don't see very often like Glorious or a Norn cultural skin."

My suggestion would be to find some different colors that stand out through the poly-lum gem. I've been playing with the gems for a bit and I think they shine when you find different colors that pop through.   The big benefit is that it will make the glowing green from the poly-lum a less obvious source which is what I was going for with my golden god character.   I haven't played with the green color yet but I imagine a strong red might peak through or a blue might end up turning yellow which could be cool too."

GuildWarsDyeJob,3159iy,DHoney,3,Thu Apr 2 02:28:25 2015 UTC,"I assume you're not looking for a dyejob that works with both greatswords since you mention changing hair color, so I'll take one at a time. The GSes are quite different colorwise so having the same dyes for both will be pretty hard, I think.  Twilight: Try a dark, saturated blue instead of black. I think that could work well if you don't want the cliché black/red. Maybe something like Midnight Sky/Blue or a lighter one like Iron.  I don't have the Ascended skins myself but I'm thinking something like this. I couldn't pick dyeslots as you do in the wardrobe so imagine the boots not being red. Dark blue is Midnight Sky, lighter blue is Deep Glacial Sky (expensive, but best I could find), red is Blood and the brown-ish metal is Pewter (I wanted it to match the hilt).  Sunrise: I think there are more dye options for this one (as long as you don't have to match Twilight at the same time of course). Gold and blue are the most obvious choices. Using one of them could be enough. I've seen a lot of heavy armored characters use a lot of gold (to match the hilt) and dark blue, and that usually looks great. If you want to be more original try other warm colors (brown, orange, red, yellow, pink or maybe even purple) on parts of the armor too.   A dark dyejob with not so much gold would make the GS stand out more, so personally I'd go with that; maybe something like this. Again, the placing isn't the best. I'd make the entire legs darker if I could, probably a slightly lighter brown like Earthen or Taupe. Blue is Glacial Sky (didn't have time to look for cheaper ones), brown is Midnight Gold, pink is Cream and gold is Sand (you can probably find a better gold). The fluffy parts could be a more vibrant color. Anyway, if you want a lighter dyejob with more gold I'm sure that will work too.  I don't really know how to make the same dyejob work for both greatswords, if that is what you were asking. I'd go for a dark dyejob, definitely with blue, and maybe that brown dye which matches the hilt (Pewter or similar). Hopefully this helped anyway. Good luck!"
GuildWarsDyeJob,3159iy,Blue-C,2,Thu Apr 2 16:09:14 2015 UTC,"This is pretty helpful actually. I like the Twilight idea with red hair a lot.

GuildWarsDyeJob,311hd6,nessx007,3,Wed Apr 1 10:34:58 2015 UTC,iirc each piece of armor saves whatever dye coloring you've used on it rather than saving the colors in the armor slot itself. so no thre isn't a way to automate that. however you can save your preferred colors on a per character basis by right clicking on the dye and selecting 'add to favorites' i believe each character can have about 8 favorite dyes.

Two color combos are pretty standard stuff in game (most commonly abyss + celestial = yawn) three colors pop up here and there. Four color combos are very rare and impressive - when they work.  Beyond that most people fail to pull it off. So fantastic job!   Anyway minor comments. The chest texture from the carapace chest is just too advanced for the nearing 3 year old ascalon gloves. The dye is much deeper and darker on it and it stands out a bit. My suggestion would be either go lighter on the chest or darker on the gloves and legs.   While you don't need shoulders for this look here are three that might look interesting without being too massive: orrian, stag, and clockwork."

I debated waiting to post until I figured it out, but I'm with you that the ascalonian looks plain compared to the rest of the set.  Both sky blue and summer breeze were closer in saturation but didn't quite match the highlights. Do you know if there's something in between with a metal finish?"
GuildWarsDyeJob,30pn5v,IgnorantThrall,2,Sun Mar 29 22:53:44 2015 UTC,addendum: Amenity color-matches the gloves to the chest; but I'm not prepared to spend 25g for another variation on sky-blue.   This would technically bring the color scheme up to 8 unique dyes and about ~6 actual colors.
GuildWarsDyeJob,30ogmp,Jovasa,3,Sun Mar 29 06:33:45 2015 UTC,The knee clipping is too much with the HoM legs.
GuildWarsDyeJob,30ogmp,SaintQuid,2,Sun Mar 29 19:49:12 2015 UTC,"Both are good but I prefer the second one with the pants, except without the Celestial dye on the metal. Celestial is too bright imo."
GuildWarsDyeJob,30ogmp,Blue-C,1 point,Sun Mar 29 16:57:01 2015 UTC,I really like the first one

GuildWarsDyeJob,30m003,ShirokamiSenpai,6,Sat Mar 28 16:31:46 2015 UTC,"The second from the right? Sneakthief mask, Sorrows Embrace shoulders, CoE coat, Prowler gloves, Heritage boots and random pants."
GuildWarsDyeJob,30m003,Soulmy,2,Sun Mar 29 09:12:28 2015 UTC,"Looking at the chestpieces, number one and two from the left are both human tier 2 or 1 (can't remember which),. Number three and four are from crucible of eternity. Number 5 is duelist.  Hope I helped you out!"
GuildWarsDyeJob,30m003,zammony,2,Sat Mar 28 17:14:40 2015 UTC,It's tier 2 human.
GuildWarsDyeJob,30m003,The_77th_orange,1 point,Sat Mar 28 17:44:44 2015 UTC,"Helm and shoulders are human t1. Chest is human t2. Gloves and boots look like Sorrow's embrace. Pants are generic, probably a lot of skins that look that way. Hope I helped."

GuildWarsDyeJob,30mie0,GrimxTswift,1 point,Sat Mar 28 19:09:29 2015 UTC,The colors are pretty standard. Especially for Sylvari there are way better and unique color possibilities.
