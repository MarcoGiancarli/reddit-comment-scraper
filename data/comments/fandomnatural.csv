(and of course Gabe's alive, somewhere)      In my head, Lucifer would rebuild a Nick copy and look like him again. Michael has possessed John and Adam, and we're not getting Jake back, but JDM wants (maybe) back, so Michael could copy him."

These are in no particular order :)   Have Love Will Travel - squeemonster Extremely sexy/adorable stripper!dean fic :)   Hunting For Faith - pappcave/riseofthefallenone Reverse!verse amazingness. I was completely pulled into this story.   Small Town Charmer - lastknownwriter  Edit: * SO apparently I'm an idiot for not realizing that Sparrow was the one who made this thread lol! BUT in my defense I would (and have) absolutely rec her fics to anyone! ** Forgotten - NorthernSparrow Sparrow is just amazing. I wish her stuff was cannon! Also you have to read the sequel ""Flight"" (and A Room of Ones Own if you want some smut :P)  [Forgotten can be considered gen-fic. Flight is Destiel but she has a gen version called Broken (it's not finished yet though unlike Flight!) I also haven't read Broken so idk how she's making it gen]  Orpheus - Sysrae I love all of Sysrae's work. Fools Rush In is amazing too!  Cross to Bear - Zafona Super long fic but her verse is amazing. It's doesn't follow cannon at all but it's so good!  A Hole in the World - AnnelieseMichel Don't knock this one till you try it. Not your typical a/b/o fic, it's non-were and written very well.  Twist and Shout - Gabriel/standbyme  If you haven't read this one, prepare for your life to be ruined. Just sayin'...  The Soul Piece - cloudyjenn This one is a work in progress and hasn't been updated in 2-ish years. Don't worry though, it leaves off perfectly, no cliff hangers. It's also my favorite :)  Cooking With Gas - Winjennster I'm currently reading this one and it's amazing (as are all of Jenn's fics)   And a last fun one. This is totally a crack fic but it's amazing and adorable. (No cross-species sexy times!)  What Has Eight Tentacles and Isn't Allowed to Eat Pie? - Annie D"

This is by no means perfect - among other things, there was evidently some kind of power struggle over the last chapter (Zatnikatel posted the original version), but the sheer quality of the writing and the insanity of the undertaking makes this one a must read."

Luckily, he knows a guy.  Thursday's Child  What would have happened if past!Dean hadn’t turned up in 2014, and future!Dean had actually succeeded in killing Lucifer with the Colt?  The Substitute  Dean smells his mate one morning while getting his mail. He keeps smelling him in several different places, but never sees him. After months of smelling the mate scent without seeing his mate, Dean becomes cranky and begins to think he might go crazy.  Then one day, the scent walks into his shop with a car repair, and Castiel is nothing like what Dean thought he would be. They hit it off easily despite Castiel’s traditional upbringing, but there is one barrier to their domestic bliss: Castiel is betrothed to another. (ABO , may not be ""the best of all time""  but it is one of my favorites)  The Breath Of All Things   Dean Winchester was twenty-six years old when a car accident killed his father and left him paralysed from the waist down. A year and a half later, Dean is in a wheelchair and lives in a care home in Kansas, where he spends his days waiting to die. It's only when Castiel Novak starts volunteering at the care home that Dean starts to wonder if a changed life always equals a ruined one.  Almost forgot:  Everytown, USA Dean's determined not to stay in one place for long--he's enjoying his new-found freedom too much. Castiel might be the one to make him stick around.  ETA: The Face Behind A Mirror   Castiel, a lone alpha wolf, would like nothing more than to be left alone in his house to die. He wants nothing to do with the outside world and doesn't have anything to offer to anyone. Then, one early morning, a black car crashes into a tree right beside his house. The driver is rendered unconscious and doesn't remember a thing after he wakes up. He is also an omega, but there's something very wrong with him."

fandomnatural,3dub4u,bookshop,6,Sun Jul 19 22:53:19 2015 UTC,"Alright trying to go with fics that weren't already posted by someone else in this thread(or at least weren't posted at the time I started typing this comment). These are all Destiel, all are Mature/Explicit because THAT IS HOW I ROLL. Some of these are pretty well known but hey rereading's always good :D.  Have some of my fave longfics:  Named by RC_McLachlan: Canon based, post season 4. One of the first stories to really kick me in the ass with how into it I was. Fic spoiler if you want it: Don't worry about the MCD warning.  A Vague Memory of Wisdom by takadainmate: Canon based, early season 5. Dean and Castiel trapped in an old library, under the influence of sex demons!!! It's less cracky than I'm making it sound. Four parts, only posted to LJ as far as I know.  Après by imogenbynight: Canon based, post season 8. I don't read many canon based fics these days but this one was sooo sweet, and romantic and just lots of love in there.  and now the AUs  Shortskirts 'Verse by twentysomething: Fluffy fluffy tooth rotting fluff. Highschool/College/Beyond.   Asunder by rageprufrock: Cas is a doctor, Dean is a social worker, and they're off to the wedding of Sam, Dean's estranged brother. Despite the tension going on between some of the characters, this is a great fluffy mood lifting fic for me. One of the ones I've reread the most.  The Parts of Our Sum by Annie D (scaramouche): Does this even need selling? It's by Annie D. Sci-fi world, and I love human (or mostly human) AUs that still create a sense of otherness/danger about Castiel.  A Beginner's Guide to Communing with the Dead by  suspiciousflashlight: The world building in this fic really does it for me. Dean is a police officer in a world where magic is a thing, and Castiel is the ancient and powerful being that he enslaves to help him solve a case that's quite literally haunting him.  The Last Great Race wincechesters (madefrommemories): If you don't kind of want to run away to Alaska and become a sled racer by the end of the story... well then read it again you heathen.  On Wings Of Steel by Misachan: Amazing world building, ugh. The story itself is a satisfying length but at the same time I would kill for more, and that's a good thing.  The Ends of Earth by darkforetold: 6,000 hits is nothing to sneeze at but I've always felt like this fic deserved more notice. This is another story with a great and interesting setting, the world unfolds for you and reads like reality, and I love stories like that."
fandomnatural,3dub4u,Potionsmstrs,4,Sun Jul 19 19:18:40 2015 UTC,I second and third asunder - it's one of my warm blanket fics. It's so good whe you are upset it is effectively a warm blanket for your soul.

fandomnatural,3dub4u,natalievenom,6,Sun Jul 19 22:21:44 2015 UTC,"I know others have already mentioned some of these but I'm just gonna go ahead and toss out my favorite anyway. I'm sure I'll think of a million more after I post this list. I have a horrible habit of not bookmarking stuff:  Kingdom Come by cheesewithmy - This was taken down by the author but you can find an epub link to it on the above page. I love this fic so much. Everything about it is perfect for an AU. LOVE LOVE.   Astrophysics and Tea 'Verse by casfallsinlove. - I almost picked this author's story Easy Now, With My Heart instead but I find that I go back and read the first one more often than the other.   Shortskirts 'Verse by twentysomething - This is a must read for anyone who ships Destiel. It's gorgeous and funny and I normally become disinterested in a story once the two characters get together but not so with this one. It only gets better the longer it goes on.   Asunder by rageprufrock - OMG OMG... i can't say enough good things about this. Just read it.  A Beginner's Guide to Communing with the Dead by suspiciousflashlight - Cas is a little shit in this one and I love it.  Shut Up (Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is) by kototyph - random hook ups that lead to permanence. YES YES  Chasing Cars by ratherbehere - there are two strip scenes in this fic that will make you scream.  On Air by wincechesters (madefrommemories) - bestfriends to lovers. woo  Bratishka: Little Brother by Valinde (Valyria) - ex-mob cas and cop dean... bestfriends to lovers. HELL YEAH.   Carry On by TamrynEradani - everyone and their mom will have this one their list. It deserves it.   I already reached 10? stares at her list of fics she hasn't mentioned ;___;"

In Loving Memory is about what happens when Sam and Dean are supposedly gone.  ""No one knows what really happened in the final chapter of the Winchester's tale. They may be dead, or alive, or ruling it up as angels in Heaven. All that is known, is that the brothers have vanished, but the world of Supernatural continues on without them.

It's very long (2 separate parts so far plus some side-adventure thingies), and it's INCREDIBLY dark (really), but honest to god, it's amazing. It's also unfinished, and because the chapters are massive and incredibly well-written, it's a LONG time between updates... but it's been reliably updated since 2010 and now stands somewhere around 500,000 words, so I don't think it's likely to end up being one of those tragically abandoned WIPs, at least."

fandomnatural,3dub4u,Clint_Hawkguy_Barton,5,Tue Jul 21 00:54:13 2015 UTC,Do people have any recommendations for gen fics?
fandomnatural,3dub4u,Patitomuerto,6,Sun Jul 19 18:03:10 2015 UTC,I rarely read gen fics but I highly recommend While Angels Watched by Sharlot.  Teenage Dean has a major medical malfunction so John and Sam try to cope and keep hope. It sounds really depressing but I promise it's not actually that sad and it has a great ending. It's a preseries fic that fits perfectly into canon.

But a quick couple that I see missing from the recs below :    Try-Something Tuesday by almaasi  Human AU. Dean Winchester teaches a third-grade class. He's new to this whole ‘bisexual’ thing - but by pure happenstance, he meets Castiel: a particularly dapper male librarian who moonlights as a substitute teacher. Dean's curious and Castiel is willing, so why the hell not   The Best Years of Our Lives, My Ass by ireallyhatecornnuts   AU after Season 8, episode 6, ""Southern Comfort.""

fandomnatural,3dub4u,Angatita,3,Mon Jul 20 03:30:09 2015 UTC,"Hmm… Let’s see… In no particular order, all Destiel (safe for one that has a hint of Wincest/Wincestiel):  Welcome to Oz by Bauble  Dean and Castiel find themselves in a mysterious suburb at the top of a mountain. With no way to escape, they’re forced to take up semi-ordinary lives as a general store manager and a school teacher.  I so love this type of stories… Dean and Cas stuck somewhere, can’t escape, gotta work together, grow closer even though they take their sweet ol' time about it.  A Night at the Museum by Swordofmymouth  For anyone who’s seen 5.04 all the way through, and wondered what happened afterward, in the Year of Apocalypse, 2014 – this is that story.  Oh, my heart… this, THIS, story just blew my mind. I loved it so much and I gotta admit, I’m kind of afraid of reading it again. I will, eventually, but… I’m only human, you know?  There’s Only One Sure Thing That I Know by leah k (blinkiesays)  Dean doesn't even get halfway through explaining before Bobby starts laughing. When he lets himself think about it for more than five seconds, Dean can almost see Bobby's point: he's faced down demons, witches, vampires, werewolves, ghosts, angels, and Satan himself and now he's been defeated by the God damn Midwest.  Yeah… another Dean and Cas stuck somewhere they can’t leave and grow closer overtime and it’s oh so pretty. You might be able to tell by now that I have a predilection for the genre.  Cult-De-Sac by BlueMorpho  Dean and Castiel go undercover in an insulated family community to investigate the bizarre and gruesome death of a married couple. Hijinks ensue.  Right next to ""trapped"" and ""djinns"", fake married are my favorite kind. And this one’s a great one in my opinion, I just adore it.  The Story of You and Me by the_diggler  Dean wakes up in bed next to a very human Castiel, and a journal in his own handwriting that tells him it’s two years in the future. The house looks a lot like Bobby’s, and Sam lives there too… He just can’t remember how they got from angels falling in the sky – to comfortable domesticity. While there is much in the journal Dean doesn’t remember, there is much of their story he’s always known. And as he settles into the routine of his new life and relationship with Castiel, it quickly becomes something he doesn’t know how to live without.  Oh, do I like this one… Domestic Destiel? Yes, please!!!  Greed by HigherMagic  ""So, if your boyfriend and your brother swapped bodies and you had to have sex with one of them to change them back, who would you choose?""  Okay, I gotta say, I’m not a Wincest or Wincestiel girl, like at all… but this story here is so well done, and heart-wrenching and… it didn’t convert me to brotherly lovin' BUT I still enjoyed the tale very much. Worth the read, I swear.  All Things Shining by Askance, standbyme  Something in the world is waking up. It isn’t long before it’s brought to the attention of the Winchesters and Castiel: miracles are spreading across the country, the paranormal seems to be shrinking back on itself—and it all has something to do with the missing prayer book of a traveling preacher who died over a century ago. Dean is convinced it’s all the lead-up to another Apocalypse; Sam and Castiel aren’t so sure. Regardless, it sends them out on a less-than-typical road-trip, following the Mississippi and remnants of a very old story that seems increasingly to call to them. And along the way the trio learn much more about themselves—and the consequences and origins of love—than they’d ever have anticipated.  I think that was one of the first Destiel fics I ever read and I totally fell in love with the slow pace, how it almost read like a fairytale. Did I tell you I was a sucker for slow burn?  Paved With Good Intentions by CSMARTIN  When Castiel finally locates Dean in Hell after forty years, he finds the righteous man changed into something much darker than the angel had expected. Such a creature cannot be resurrected, so Castiel must return him to the man he used to be before he can be sent back to Earth.  I’ve rec'd this before on this sub but, I can’t help it, I just loved it too much. Love the intimate feel of that story…  Hard Road by AleishaPotter  Dean discovers a few truths about himself when he and Cas are forced to go undercover on a hunt to the very last place Dean ever thought he’d find himself: a gay resort called ""Last Hope"" that is geared towards helping troubled homosexual couples repair their relationships.  That must have been one of my favourite ""fake married"" stories… or one of my first… either or, it’s awfully good. And if I’m not mistaken, I wouldn’t be the first one to rec in that very thread. lol  Real Slick Dean by trilliath  There's a new alpha enhancer drug ""Rutter"" on the streets that gets used at ""exclusive parties"" for the worst purposes. Detective Castiel Novak and his partner Balthazar work hard to put a stop to it and other sex crimes in their work as Special Victim's top detectives. Ellen Harvelle's Roadhouse is both a bar and a refuge for unmated Omegas. The Roadhouse gives Omegas the opportunity have their heats in peace and, if they so desire, even sell an 'exclusive supply of high-grade slick for the unmated Alpha on the go!'. Castiel is just such an Alpha, career oriented and having no time for casual sex or potential mates. He's a regular customer who only buys donor D347's slick. He's also a family friend and advocate who helps Omegas in need get connected with Ellen. It's all fine until one night after a difficult bust he brings Ellen a new Omega about to have her first heat. What Alpha Castiel doesn't realize is that he's been over-dosed with Rutter during the fight and is about to go into a rut so bad he may die. And if that weren't enough to kill him, the embarrassment he's about to feel will, because he's about to meet donor D347 face to face and neither of them are prepared for what's going to happen.  I’m not a huge fan of A/B/O but I gotta say, I found this one’s hot as hell."
fandomnatural,3dub4u,MarmeLady,3,Mon Jul 20 05:50:15 2015 UTC,Have you read Into the Fray by HigherMagic? It's a/b/o and amazing because Cas is a badass mobster/gangster

Here's a few of my favorite Sabriel fics:  Rock the Vote - http://archiveofourown.org/works/1097487  Gabriel is running for governor of CA and Sam signs on as an intern after graduating law school. Kind of a rollercoaster of emotions between the two but ends up kinda sappy (which I love). Words: 12,455 . AO3 rating: Explicit.  My score: 9/10  Further Up and Further In - http://archiveofourown.org/works/514627  During a leave of absence from his law firm, Sam is grieving the death of his wife Ruby. To while away the time, he starts spending time with his neighbor Gabriel, a smart-ass whose idea of fun conversation includes an hours-long discussion of philosophy. They begin to spend all their free time together, building toward romance so slowly that Sam honestly doesn't see it coming. And once he returns to work, Gabriel helps him investigate a nefarious conspiracy involving Sam's late wife and the boss at his firm, Mr. Scratch. Words: 24,871 . AO3 rating: Explicit. My score: 9.5/10  And here's some Destiel:  Have Love, Will Travel - http://archiveofourown.org/works/565455  Castiel - a reclusive, obsessive compulsive and phobia-ridden author - gets dragged to a strip club by his obnoxious brother Gabriel. There he is mesmerized by stripper Dean, whose comfortable stage presence and sexual magnetism mask a host of deep emotional and familial troubles. They grow closer and slowly start to open up to each other - a new and terrifying concept for both. Words: 94,050 . AO3 rating: Explicit. My score: 10/10  Ready to Fall - http://archiveofourown.org/works/1988691  When Dean tells his mother he's bringing somebody home for summer break, she mistakenly believes Castiel is her son's new boyfriend. When they arrive at the Winchester house, the easiest solution is to go along with it - at least at first. Dean's love for his best friend becomes more and more difficult to keep separate from the fake relationship they're putting on for the family's sake. AO3 rating: Mature . My score: 9/10  And my all time fave:  Named - https://fanfiction.net/s/6620318/1/Named  This one is super long and really intense so I don't want to go into a lot of detail (especially cause it's been a while since I read it and some of the plot escapes me atm). But I can tell you it's canon-divergent, Destiel, all about fate and origins and the role of God and the Righteous Man and it's  just very extremely EPIC in what happens throughout this story. Lots of angels and demons involved, Metatron is there being a fuckwad as usual, and... it's just really fucking epic. Words: 100K+ (the site doesn't give the exact word count, sorry). FF.net rating: Teen. My score: 13881042748/10"
fandomnatural,3dub4u,StandingOwlvation,3,Mon Jul 20 08:45:31 2015 UTC,"Most of what I would have recced has been recced here already, especially Named, but I have to add the following:   Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition by Nekomitsu. This is a brilliant, long, hilarious, wonderfully written Dean/Cas fic that sees Dean going to heaven and becoming an angel and treating his new job with all the irreverence you'd expect him to. It's amazing. But the catch is: the fic has been deleted (it was originally posted on LJ), and now survives only in podfic form thanks to a great podficcer named diurnal_lee.  The Consequences of Falling by FayJay. A story in fifteen parts, in which the angel Castiel finds himself put in an untenable position, and consequentially loses his grace. In which he goes on a roadtrip with a demon, discovers the delights of tequila and french fries and pie, plays a starring role in a virgin sacrifice, is deflowered by his favourite Winchester, and then gets some very unpleasant news indeed.  Laughing as a Young Man Laughs by Natt. This is an AMAZING Dean/Death fic. If you ever thought that pairing was intriguing this is the only fic you'll ever need to be convinced. It's so good.  All of trinityofone's Destiel fic! She hasn't written much since S5 but what's there is brilliant.  All of orange_crushed/robotmango's Destiel fic, most of which are Destiel responses to individual episodes. Her Season 9 fix-its got me through that season.  Bing Crosby's ""Pennies From Heaven"" by twentysomething, a great Gabriel-centric Samiel fic in which Gabe doesn't die but instead follows Sam around engineering apocalyptic victories and also giving him free coke.  :)  If you only check out one of those I really encourage you not to be put off by the podfic format and ""read"" Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition. It's SO GOOD."

fandomnatural,3dub4u,Ennil,3,Mon Jul 20 20:42:45 2015 UTC,"There are so many that have already been mentioned that are great, so instead of rec-ing them again, I'll just add a few of my favorites.    Gen  Coming Down on a Sunny Day by maychorian Teen & Up  In 2009, Castiel watches the Apocalypse end disastrously and makes a decision. In 1984, John Winchester suddenly finds himself with another little boy on his hands, one with dark, messy hair and sad blue eyes who won't leave John and his sons alone.  Hail Mary by galaxysoup Teen & Up  Take one newly human ex-angel on the run from Heaven. Combine with one mysteriously resurrected and increasingly pissed off Mary Winchester. Add overtones of Apocalypse. Shake well.  Of Unconventional Dealbreaking by rionaleonhart R, for language  Dean, much to his annoyance, gets turned into a unicorn.    Destiel  The Cabin by Bookkbaby  Explicit  For an angel, the building of a Nest is sacred. Dean doesn't understand.  The Last Moonlight Serenade by gankyourdarlings Mature  It's the night before 1945 and Honolulu is celebrating like flipping the calendar is all it'll take to end this thing and send everybody home. Makes for one hell of a party. But it's been a long war, getting longer, and Dean Winchester stopped pinning his hopes on anything a long time ago. Then, as the clock ticks down to the new year, he finds himself in the company of a grounded fighter pilot. All of the sudden, maybe there's something to look forward to.  Never Not Fantastic Mature  When television star Dean Winchester makes a stop at the Rogue Wave Cafe, owner Castiel Novak initially takes notice - and exception to - the celebrity's presence in the all-but-forgotten beachside town where the age of the average resident is sixty-five.  This is a story about love and love, about family, friends, and more than friends, about learning when to hold on and when to let go, and about maybe, finding some turtles along the way.  Ninety One Whiskey by komodobits Explicit  In the spring of 1944, the 104th Medical Battalion of the United States Army is disbanded, and its men reassigned to various infantry companies in preparation for their invasion of occupied France. For First Lieutenant Novak, this is less than helpful, as he has so far met his platoon’s designated medic a grand total of twice, and has both times found Sergeant Winchester to be the optimum combination of reckless, arrogant, and downright insufferable so as to make cohesive platoon function near impossible. When the time comes to move out, however, Castiel has to reconcile himself to the fact that men are going to go down and trust in the knowledge that Dean Winchester may well be the only person who can put them back together again. WW2 ETO infantry AU. WIP  The Oxpecker on the Buffalo's Back by komodobits Mature  (poemfic) Death rides in an old cream car and takes who he wants, but simply letting go is for the tired and hopeless, and Castiel is neither. He takes the nearest vessel available, and he holds on for as long as he can.  Remnants by RC_McLachlan G  All that remains is what we can barely comprehend.  300 Things by cautionzombies Explicit  Dean's life at twenty-four makes him feel like he's forty—he works two jobs to help pay bills for his house and put his genius little brother through private school, and has spent six years (on and off, let's be honest) working on his mechanical engineering degree at KU. With so much of his life devoted to his family, Dean has little time in his schedule for class and no time for social interaction. Then, while getting his classes together for the fall, he finds himself in a do-or-die situation: He must take his last literature class now, his spring already filled with those left for his major...except that none of the English classes will fit his schedule.  This is how Dean grovels and begs Dr. Castiel Milton to make a special arrangement for him, and Dr. Milton does."

Even if you have insurance it's almost never covered, but at least you could get your meds cheap I suppose.  Generally, if you can't afford to drop a few hundred a month, good luck.     (and even if you can afford it, there's always the chance that your psychiatrist will eat you, but I'm gonna assume that's rare.)"

fandomnatural,3dv2x2,milliways86,10,Mon Jul 20 18:24:07 2015 UTC,"Now of course, Padalecki has access to things that other people coping with mental illness don’t have, like endless amounts of money for treatment and the ability to take weeks off to unwind.    Yes, Jared is lucky in many respects.  But as for taking off when he's feeling crappy?  Well, if he needs time off during a SHOW HIATUS, like this summer, yeah, he ""only"" had to cancel a couple of convention appearances.  But during the show production?  When he's in the middle of working 18-hour days in Vancouver, where you sometimes don't see the sun for a month?  When Jared describes his ""bad time"" on the show, that was S3, and he was all of 26 years old.  Yes, he could have ""taken weeks off"" - AND halted production on a television show, AND sent the cast and crew (who are all dependent on a paycheck from said show) home to cool their heels.  You feel like this makes him ""lucky?""  Really?  Because, I really think this speaks to Jared being one amazing individual.   Judging from these same fans’ response to Padalecki at San Diego Comic-Con — over 7,000 of them lit candles at the “Supernatural” panel in his honor   Yeah, this is really a nitpick, but I wish someone would fact check.  Fact: there are approximatelly 7,000 seats TOTAL in Hall H.  Fact: MOST of the room did not get candles, they had run out, and we had no flipping idea what was going on until we read about it later.  Yeah, it was a cool cause, and I totes would have held my phone up.  But I'd say more like 3,000 candles max.  You could have talked to the folks who arranged it to get an accurate count, that is, if you weren't lazy as fuck.  Sorry, but if I know one fact is inaccurate, I start to wonder about everything else you've written.  Get it right or go home."
fandomnatural,3dv2x2,Vio_,4,Sun Jul 19 19:38:28 2015 UTC,I was kinda struggling to see the point the article was trying to make and I think there's a simple reason for that: the article is pointless.

fandomnatural,3duujd,3mpress0fHell,7,Sun Jul 19 18:20:34 2015 UTC,"I would have liked for Dean to have killed Sam and have Death bring Dean off to another place. For them to deiced it together(how it almost played out).   I know a lot of people are its all about the brothers, they will always choose each other.  No! I do believe they would choose to save the world from this DAAARRRKKNEESS.  SAVING PEOPLE is an important part of the family motto.  I would not have looked at the bros and said they gave up or were out of character. If anything I would have said they have GROWN.   It would have been a beautiful,yet heart wrenching way to end the series.   I personally still dont see it as Dean who killed Death, but a last ditch effort of the Mark to use its influence on Dean to kill Death.   Death was a threat to the Mark.  The Mark ""knew"" that things were set in place for the spell to happen that would remove it from Dean and thus release the Darkness."
fandomnatural,3duujd,dancingmuffin,3,Sun Jul 19 19:02:27 2015 UTC,I agree. That resolution was the anti-Swan Song.
fandomnatural,3duujd,comewithallgood,6,Mon Jul 20 06:30:47 2015 UTC,"Well...I guess I'll admit in this thread...I don't really care about Sam. I stopped identifying with his character somewhere in the distant past, maybe around demon blood time, and my interest has just never recovered. I don't have any antipathy towards Sam (it would be kind of hard to watch SPN if I disliked Sam), but I just don't see any interesting shades to his character or any engaging paths for character growth.  I hang out in Dean 'n' Cas land a lot, and within that land a lot of people jump over backwards to assure people that they care about Sam too! And they don't want The Dean And Cas Show! But uh...I just stay quiet on that topic. Because, well..."
fandomnatural,3duujd,weboverload,3,Mon Jul 20 01:26:20 2015 UTC,"This season was the most I liked Sam, because he finally started to let go of that anger and sadness over his past life and family. It's not so much about accepting things in general, but accepting them on his terms.   I finally see him starting to reflect a bit more beyond the angry young man phase (Dean did it a bit in S2-3), and recognize that decisions his family made were done for valid reasons and not just to arbitrarily piss him off.  I wish they would do more with him and the bunker on things that he wants to do. It's not a pop culture haven of research and exposition, but engaging in the archives and library for things that he wants to do and enjoy.  Unfortunately, I've seen a lot of people who are big Sam fans who hate S10 Sam, I guess because he's not finally just not raging against the machine, but has come to accept his life and enjoy the things that he can while accepting that this is his life but can still enjoy the stuff that makes him happy. Also, because it's ""not all about Sam."" I've also heard that one."
fandomnatural,3duujd,Vio_,6,Mon Jul 20 13:31:44 2015 UTC,"Dean is a terrible person.  Sam is worse. I wish Dean had become Crowley's enforcer, that they had ruled hell together. I would have liked to have seen an entire season of Cas and Dean fighting each-other (Dean gradually coming to treat Cas with more respect) while Sam loses his marbles, before stepping up and organizing men of letters info sessions, basically just training various hunters in the bunker, continually getting more eyes on the library to figure out how what the hell to do about Dean. I love to hate Metatron. I wish he had ended up locked in the bunker for a season or half season. Crazy!Cas was my favourite Cas. I love seeing Castiel getting beaten to a pulp, because I LOVE his ""I can't win but I will keep coming no matter what"" look. Rowena is terrible and I am not interested in her at all. Seeing Crowley not react while she tried to manipulate him was entertaining, but got old. I wish Abaddon HAD posessed Dean. I would've paid good cash money for an entire season of Abaddon!Dean vs. Gadreel!Sam. I still think Supernatural is worth watching."
fandomnatural,3duujd,Zeryx,3,Mon Jul 20 01:35:00 2015 UTC,"This is freaky. Can I just say I agree with you on every single line?  I have my little theory of why Dean and Sam can become so ... terrible. I thought both lead actors were cast against type. Sam is supposed to be sensitive and scholarly while Dean is the care free, shoot first ask later one. But for a long show with heavy focus on both characters, over the years their strength and own personalities seeped through and now the characters became incoherent and bizarre sometimes. That being said, the writing of the show is certainly not helping. They had thrown the brothers under the bus way more times than I could count.  And, I think Supernatural is worth watching too. I feel like I just need to categorize all the negatives before I can say I like something.   And one more thing, I probably should start my thread instead of tagging onto your reply (but I'm so lazy I'd rather type all that than clicking a button) because it's certainly not an extension of what you said: I'm getting tired of the factions of the fans. This is probably the biggest fandom I've ever visited, and I'm guessing that's why there're so many factions that are at odds with each other? LOVE, LOVE the crazily good quality of fanart and fanfiction that came out of it (possibly because of the size of the fandom) though."
fandomnatural,3duujd,javalorum,3,Mon Jul 20 18:29:32 2015 UTC,So many.  So so many.  I liked Cole.  I like Metatron.  I liked the MoC storyline.  I liked season 9.  I liked season 10.  I'm excited for season 11.     I hated when Sam had sideburns.   I didn't care that much when Charlie died.  John Winchester wasn't a horrible father.  I think angels have preferred genders.  I still don't see what was wrong with Sam drinking demon blood.
fandomnatural,3duujd,Clint_Hawkguy_Barton,4,Mon Jul 20 04:21:50 2015 UTC,"I'd be unhappy if they killed off Cas because I'm friends with so many people that adore him here & I don't want 'em hurting lol. But I do think it's conceivable a Cas death could be done in a really cool way though (I think honestly he'd come back after getting killed though bc social media is such a powerful thing & Cas fans would get pretty vocal).  My unpopular opinion is that it wasn't right of the show to have thrown John Winchester under the bus in order to pedestal Bobby as the boys' father figure. In RL Bobby was supposed to be a one-off character, then they brought him back bc they liked him & gave him kind of an uncle-y role in the boys' lives. As time went on, they shoved him more into a ""Bobby was the boys' true father,"" thing, pinnacle moment with that was the episode Death's Door where Bobby yells at his father that he'd raised heroes. I really wanted to be emotional about that scene but the minute he said that I was like, ""so John's memory & role in their lives is chop liver now huh writers? aight wha eva"""
fandomnatural,3duujd,stophauntingme,3,Sun Jul 19 18:49:23 2015 UTC,"The thing is, they could have balanced it a lot more than they did. Bobby could have been the one who could have been the more lax of the two while still showing that John had every reason in the world to make the hard decisions that he made.  But the show in general has shied away from its rough and tumble roots."
fandomnatural,3duujd,Vio_,3,Sun Jul 19 23:37:42 2015 UTC,"As a HUGE Cas fan, I also have no issue with the character dieing (I'd be SUPER SAD ). And it could be done in a lot of meaningful, ""awesome"" ways. But I dont have the trust in the writers to do his death any justice.   Hell as MUCH as it would have fucking HURT and would have killed me I would have been fine for Dean to have killed him in The Prisoner. That would have been a ""beautiful"" death for the character.  And would have really SHOWN us how far gone Dean was."
fandomnatural,3duujd,dancingmuffin,2,Sun Jul 19 19:10:45 2015 UTC,This.  But their idea of a dramatical Cas death is him dissolving into black goo and Dean being annoyed about it for half a season.
fandomnatural,3duujd,tikistitch,2,Mon Jul 20 17:32:47 2015 UTC,Hi! I have removed the spoiler flair since there's no need in this sub if it's not about a future/recent episode :) Can't do much about the title but that's fine.
fandomnatural,3duujd,comewithallgood,2,Sun Jul 19 18:33:51 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I'd have to say imo that all told, S06 wasn't that bad. Dean is one of my least favorite characters and I don't think it was wrong for Sam to not look for him in Purgatory. I don't think Gabriel should come back to the show (wouldn't hate it if he did, just feel like his story arc is closed and that the writers would find a way to mess up his character somehow). I love the Novaks and think Claire's story was one of the most refreshing developments on the show. I still give no figs about Crowley or his storyline."
fandomnatural,3duujd,NorthernSparrow,3,Mon Jul 20 06:29:57 2015 UTC,I no longer like or admire canon-Dean and (probably related) I don't find Jensen to be very attractive. (People I don't like become physically unattractive to me. And vice versa. It's like their face changes shape!)
fandomnatural,3duujd,kenyan-girl,3,Mon Jul 20 16:41:09 2015 UTC,"me too :( Season 10 Dean was especially disappointing, I just don't identify with him any more  By the way, not to sound weird, but I love your fics, okay bye :D"

fandomnatural,3duujd,comewithallgood,2,Mon Jul 20 17:59:49 2015 UTC,Dean has become SO UNLIKEABLE for me after S06. Eighty percent of the time he's onscreen I just want to punch him in the face because of how mean-spirited he is to everyone around him (especially Kevin when he was still around).

I think he's as big an asshole as any of the other angels and zero redemptive qualities. I firmly believe he played Lucifer to the hilt and didn't even truly sacrifice himself.   I think he's as bad a villain as Crowley, we just mix fanon and canon in our heads so much that we've decided that instead of being vicious and trickey, he's actually cute and benevolent and not actually a villain. Worse than Crowley, he's had absolutely zero redemption in my head whereas Crowley actually seemed to try to help the Winchesters to a degree."

fandomnatural,3dstly,-zombie-squirrel,7,Tue Jul 21 02:05:53 2015 UTC,"Well, since Hawkguy mentioned me I guess I have to speak up. my ship is Jody/Donna/Gabe. Amarislona and I are currently writing a fic each featuring it. I think they'd all get along nicely together. Gabe and Donna would be the class clowns and Jody would be the one to keep them serious when needed. (also, I don't write smut, just fluffy stuff.)"
fandomnatural,3dstly,_Khoshekh,6,Sun Jul 19 04:29:28 2015 UTC,"Not really a shipper, but I read a Jo/Lucifer that was really good.  Probably couldn't find it again though.      Obscure enough for you?"
fandomnatural,3dstly,comewithallgood,7,Sun Jul 19 03:40:31 2015 UTC,"Other than Sastiel, Jimstiel is my other favorite rarepair (not in the creepy Stockholm way I've seen emphasized in other fics, but in the schmoopy ""these two legitimately love and care about each other"" way)."
fandomnatural,3dstly,dancingmuffin,5,Sun Jul 19 09:43:16 2015 UTC,Oh man Jimstiel! But im actually a big fan of the darker way of shipping it.   Also Dean/Jimmy
fandomnatural,3dstly,dancingmuffin,6,Sun Jul 19 18:05:49 2015 UTC,Sam/Cas is my Brotp But a few of my favorites are  Well there is Duck (Dean x Chuck) its nt so much a ship as it is a canoe!  Benny x Jo ( i dont even remember how i started shipping that one)  Jimmy/Dean/Cas  Gabe/Balthazar   Lucifer/Micheal   Endverse!Dean/Dean/Endverse!Cas
fandomnatural,3dstly,milliways86,6,Sun Jul 19 18:04:20 2015 UTC,Endverse!Dean/Dean/Endverse!Cas   Yes... that one can get... interesting.
fandomnatural,3dstly,milliways86,3,Sun Jul 19 19:35:09 2015 UTC,"Lucifer/Micheal   Well, it probably gets lonely down in the pit."
fandomnatural,3dstly,Clint_Hawkguy_Barton,5,Sun Jul 19 18:34:51 2015 UTC,Sadreel is a ship I will approach every so often.
fandomnatural,3dstly,-zombie-squirrel,4,Sun Jul 19 19:36:05 2015 UTC,"Cue /u/-zombie-squirrel in 3...2...1  (just teasing, I love you gal)"
fandomnatural,3dstly,Vio_,5,Sun Jul 19 03:11:56 2015 UTC,ooh I missed this thread thanks.
fandomnatural,3dstly,_Khoshekh,4,Sun Jul 19 04:24:46 2015 UTC,Gabriel/Crowley. Because it'd be amazingly fucked up.
fandomnatural,3dstly,-zombie-squirrel,2,Sun Jul 19 10:54:57 2015 UTC,"Hmm.  But Gabe and Dean have a lot in common, and ha had a blast with Dean so not too weird to me.  You made me think though, wouldn't Balthazar/Crowley be hilarious?      ...oh god it actually exists, I have a strange urge to read some now..."
fandomnatural,3dstly,Zeryx,2,Sun Jul 19 15:36:30 2015 UTC,I think it was muffin who directed me to a Crowthazar fic once upon a time...
fandomnatural,3dstly,TKodami,3,Mon Jul 20 02:05:12 2015 UTC,"Team Puragatory. It's not super rare, but I'm up for any combo, albeit Cas/Dean/Benny, Cas/Dean and Benny/Dean, or, and I've never actually seen this, Benny/Cas Dean/Benny. Any of them! All of them!!!"
