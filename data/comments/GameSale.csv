Not sure why Blizzard changed that, but they did.  Also you can play both for free online in any game mode except ladder. So if thats what you wanted them for you go download them now from blizz directly."

GameSale,3dvkdl,SnazzyGrant,2,Sun Jul 19 22:31:53 2015 UTC,I got my price from Amazon
GameSale,3dvkdl,SnazzyGrant,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:35:05 2015 UTC,Typically people on the sub dont go based off amazon prices cuz they are inflated. They go based off recent sold on ebay and vgpc pricing
GameSale,3dvkdl,SnazzyGrant,2,Sun Jul 19 22:36:12 2015 UTC,Oh I didn't know that. I usually sell my stuff on amazon so I just based my price off that. I wasn't trying to be a douche with that price.
GameSale,3dvkdl,SnazzyGrant,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:38:44 2015 UTC,"Its all good bro, well up to you man if you wanna go ahead and try and sell on amazon instead"
GameSale,3dvkdl,doctorquien28,3,Sun Jul 19 22:40:04 2015 UTC,I can't sell Pokemon RSE on amazon because of some stupid restrictions. So do you think $25 is fair if I add the wireless adapter?
GameSale,3dvkdl,doctorquien28,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:49:35 2015 UTC,"I wasn't aware of that, and as for wireless adapter. I don't think it has much use anymore because they disabled all internet access to everything pre pokemon x/y. So emerald can only be transfered using local connection.  I'm also not sure how much that adapter sells for so i can't tell you personally if that would be a good price or not. At the moment i'm personally just looking for the game itself"
GameSale,3dvkdl,doctorquien28,3,Sun Jul 19 22:53:31 2015 UTC,Oh no the wireless adapter isn't for wifi. It's just like the classic link cable except wireless. It came with fire FR/LG and E. I'll just post this on eBay and see if I can get a bit more. Good luck collecting all the games though. Classic Pokemon games are a bunch of fun because the exp share isn't rigged.
GameSale,3dvkdl,doctorquien28,0,Sun Jul 19 23:00:57 2015 UTC,ya finally almost done with collecting them. And goodluck selling on ebay im sure you will be able to get what you are askin

GameSale,3dsazb,Kahnbrochill,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:40:10 2015 UTC,I'd like to stay as close to 100 for those due to shipping weight and padding needed to keep them safe
