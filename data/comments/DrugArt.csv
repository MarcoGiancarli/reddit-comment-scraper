My recommendation to you would be to use reference images or do some studies of the human form (skeletal structure, muscle groups) to add a more refined aspect to your drawings. Once you know how it's ""supposed"" to look and can recreate realistic forms, then you can REALLY play with the details and make some mind blowing work.  Overall, awesome stuff!!

I'd like to start taking my own photos but that's a whole separate skill to learn so for now I'm just kind of dicking around and making cool shit."
DrugArt,2z0yet,FliesWithKites,1 point,Mon Mar 16 17:09:52 2015 UTC,Take photos of anything. Photography is hard when you over think it. Use your phone or whatever.
DrugArt,2yrdq2,Singspike,5,Thu Mar 12 04:07:52 2015 UTC,Oh you accidentally made this?
DrugArt,2yrdq2,Samdi,1 point,Thu Mar 12 05:04:31 2015 UTC,"Super rad, love it. It actually inspired me to play around with photoshop (stoned) today . Keep doin' stuff yo"

DrugArt,2yo9m7,1a52,2,Wed Mar 11 21:59:00 2015 UTC,"As with all psychedelics // deliriums, it's all about mindset. And everyone has different experiences, totally agree with your comment, man."
DrugArt,2yo9m7,Ancient_jinn,2,Fri Mar 13 01:58:20 2015 UTC,"It's not always mindset. Setting is huge, if there is a portal to the Jinn relm around you would be suprised at what you'd see. The trick is don't be scared of them. Just laugh or ignore them. OR give them a big hug. Just don't be scared.... That's what they want."

DrugArt,2yj9sk,kekeroni_pizza,15,Tue Mar 10 07:18:06 2015 UTC,glad I'm not the only one confused by this title....
DrugArt,2yj9sk,finch121,4,Tue Mar 10 11:43:01 2015 UTC,"Look closer. OP used his child's initial painting to create a pretty neat, cohesive painting."
DrugArt,2yj9sk,sssimulacrum,2,Tue Mar 10 17:27:44 2015 UTC,My initial thought (before looking at the full size pic) was that OP must have a child undergoing some kind of medicinal cannabis therapy :)
DrugArt,2yj9sk,xgnargnarx,11,Wed Mar 11 01:40:15 2015 UTC,"Ya'll are squares. Clearly I should have posted this to 4chan. JK. Yeah, the finger painting is by my 3yo, and I'm the only one who had any pot."
DrugArt,2yj9sk,_learning_as_I_go_,2,Tue Mar 10 15:24:28 2015 UTC,Cool painting op. I like that bird

DrugArt,2ya4hj,FliesWithKites,1 point,Mon Mar 16 17:09:39 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for that! Means a lot to me
DrugArt,2yca65,FlowerInADarkRoom,1 point,Sun Mar 8 15:06:58 2015 UTC,Nice! I like to imagine them zeroing in on war zones or environmental disasters and then saying this.
DrugArt,2yca65,luketaytay,1 point,Sun Mar 8 20:14:51 2015 UTC,Woah... Yeah I agree. Like they hypothesized the self-destructive nature of human beings that they created as some kind of trial of some drug or combination of elements.
DrugArt,2ybbgv,WeirdStray,2,Sun Mar 8 05:45:17 2015 UTC,Nice saying and art. I'm thinking deeply on this. Thanks.
