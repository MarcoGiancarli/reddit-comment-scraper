PS4Deals,3e3r7w,spidey555,9,Tue Jul 21 18:56:28 2015 UTC,Just a heads up for those who own a ps4 as well as steam - greenmangaming is wrapping up their summer sale encore sale and the Old Blood is $4 with the coupon they advertise on the front page (ENCORE-ENCORE-ENCORE).
PS4Deals,3e3r7w,DocktorWalrus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:26:16 2015 UTC,"Nice, pretty good deal there. I was hoping New Blood would be on sale too on PSN"
PS4Deals,3e3r7w,BillohRly,4,Tue Jul 21 19:27:26 2015 UTC,"Gavlan wheel, Gavlan deal."
PS4Deals,3e3r7w,DocktorWalrus,4,Tue Jul 21 22:15:24 2015 UTC,"Well, I know SONY has been taking their time, but the New Order is a flat $12 with the same coupon code (ENCORE-ENCORE-ENCORE).  Again, PC though.  http://www.greenmangaming.com/s/us/en/pc/games/shooter/wolfenstein-new-order/"
PS4Deals,3e3r7w,dark_delight,-11,Tue Jul 21 19:38:50 2015 UTC,Opted to get this deal instead. What would you be paying $5 extra for? The privilege of playing it on a PS4? Fuck that...  And fuck whoever downvoted you. Thanks for the heads up.
PS4Deals,3e3r7w,signofthenine,2,Tue Jul 21 21:16:32 2015 UTC,"For those playing this before The New Order (ie, it's cheap, so you take the plunge to see if you'd like the full game), know that while this is good, it's not nearly as awesome as TNO. There's a lot of great character development, fun levels, and some humor that I felt was missing here.  Still recommended, but if you find this lacking, don't pass up TNO, eventually."
PS4Deals,3e3r7w,badtree132,2,Tue Jul 21 23:10:29 2015 UTC,I loved TNO and it's one of my favorite shooters of all time. Would this DLC be a bit anorexic if I've already played the main game then?
PS4Deals,3e3r7w,signofthenine,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:15:01 2015 UTC,"I still liked it, but I also felt like it wasn't nearly as good as the main game.  You don't meet more characters, really (just a couple).  I didn't see nearly as many branching paths as TNO, where you had several ways to get to a given point (frankly, I don't recall any). Most of the levels were based around the same area, whereas in Wolf you were globe and even moon trotting, which a lot more variation in the level design.  You could certainly do a lot worse with your $10.  And like you, I loved TNO (my GOTY), so I had to see what this was about. I just wish it was closer in feel to the main game.  Total speculation: With the PC system requirements jumping between TNO and TOB (and not really seeing a lot different on the screen), I'm hoping TOB was a dry run with new/updated requirements, and now they're working on a proper sequel to TNO (esp with that whole cliffhanger ending)."

PS4Deals,3e3r7w,kotogo,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:12:24 2015 UTC,Wish there was a disc version of this. I really liked the first one but it had no replay to me so I was able to trade it back in.
PS4Deals,3e3r7w,IzeBerg,8,Tue Jul 21 20:06:17 2015 UTC,There's a disc version of it on Amazon.
PS4Deals,3e3r7w,hardangelfan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:47:41 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info!
PS4Deals,3e3r7w,adoomaloom,4,Tue Jul 21 20:58:41 2015 UTC,Came out today maybe that's why they lowered the digital one.
PS4Deals,3e3r7w,IzeBerg,5,Tue Jul 21 21:24:40 2015 UTC,The disc version comes out today in the US.
PS4Deals,3e3r7w,hoowahman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:49:04 2015 UTC,Holy smokes. That is amazing. Thanks for the info!
PS4Deals,3e3r7w,SenorV,2,Tue Jul 21 20:58:22 2015 UTC,After selling this used instead of buying digital you might save like $5.  Worth it? I don't know.
PS4Deals,3e3r7w,mesenkomaha,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:26:23 2015 UTC,"Best Buy's physical release is on the 24th and with GCU it's $16.  If their trade in value is close to Amazon's at ~$6, it'll cost $10.  But I imagine on eBay you could probably get $10-15 back."
PS4Deals,3e53vh,Fig-tv,4,Wed Jul 22 00:54:34 2015 UTC,"Absolutely loved Transistor after getting it on PS+, so I'm hoping for a similar experience with Bastion. At $3.45, it was hard to call this a tough decision."

PS4Deals,3e53vh,ModernDayLoki,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:02:32 2015 UTC,You will not be disappointed.
PS4Deals,3e53vh,accionaveed,4,Wed Jul 22 04:01:07 2015 UTC,Loved Transistor and just picked up Bastion based on that experience. I was contemplating getting it when it was $15 so at $4 there was no question.
PS4Deals,3e53vh,FabulousPaul,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:04:46 2015 UTC,Had to stop myself from buying this again (I have bastion on steam). The soundtrack and everything is just so much fun. Really great game.
PS4Deals,3e4hvf,grrumble66,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:01:56 2015 UTC,This has went away 2 or 3 times now. Hoping for another drop in price!
PS4Deals,3e4hvf,bossman-CT,3,Tue Jul 21 23:00:29 2015 UTC,"Crap. Gone again.  Yeah, I'd been wanting to buy one for awhile now and every time I saw it posted, it was gone by the time I checked. I was just happy I finally saw it in stock and wanted to share. :)  I think the fact that these come and go, even on the same day, says a lot about Wal-Mart (not) being able to keep track of their own inventory.  Hopefully it will drop again soon and you will find it in stock. :)"
PS4Deals,3e4hvf,M4db34v312,2,Tue Jul 21 23:30:00 2015 UTC,"Get it price matched at target, the person I worked with didn't care that it was out of stock in their website...plus on top of the cartwheel discount you save another 15%"
PS4Deals,3e4hvf,soleilvie,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:00:57 2015 UTC,The problem there is that the webpage now shows a secondary seller offer at $128.05. Is there a way to get the Wal-Mart offer showing that I'm not aware of?
PS4Deals,3e4hvf,frozengash,2,Wed Jul 22 00:09:17 2015 UTC,Not sure if this link is specific to me or if you'll be able to see it too. I just pulled up a cached version of the page from earlier today showing the headset as $55. You'd just have to hope that Target doesn't look too deeply into it.
PS4Deals,3e3g5w,KyuubiReddit,4,Tue Jul 21 17:41:11 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, the store doesn't deliver outside of Switzerland or Lichtenstein.  I wonder if forwarding is possible with companies like Borderlinx, although usually it's done from US or UK to the rest of Europe, not from Switzerland to US or UK.  I've never seen the PS4 at such a low price.  another webstore is also selling it for slightly more, ~290$."
PS4Deals,3e3g5w,BioDigitalMachine,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:42:45 2015 UTC,What is the other website? And can they ship to the US?

PS4Deals,3e3g5w,amitc1612,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:27:09 2015 UTC,Nah man I live in Israel and the whole shipping ordeal would make the price go twice the one in here

PS4Deals,3e3qdx,Suplewich,2,Tue Jul 21 21:37:49 2015 UTC,44.99$ for Canadians
PS4Deals,3e3qdx,sedkiller,2,Tue Jul 21 20:01:52 2015 UTC,Thanks for the heads up. Just bought it.
PS4Deals,3e3qdx,Nexus9K,2,Tue Jul 21 22:09:53 2015 UTC,"If anyone's interested in a physical copy, it's $41.99 at Target and $39.99 at Walmart right now both with free shipping or store pick up."

PS4Deals,3e3qdx,fendisalso,3,Tue Jul 21 20:17:47 2015 UTC,Yeah it's awesome. I love it. I am rank VR1 right now.  Tons of gameplay value and quests to do.

PS4Deals,3e4970,Canadian_Hooker,2,Tue Jul 21 21:00:24 2015 UTC,Is the headset any good?
PS4Deals,3e4970,ManiacApple,3,Tue Jul 21 22:01:24 2015 UTC,"This was my friend and I's first ""real headset"" and it works great. I can hear him crystal clear and vice versa. Although I have seen a few comments on previuous threads about how it's not clear, I just don't believe it. I'm always in party chat with my friends and they work great.  tldr: Yes."
PS4Deals,3e4970,junyah54,2,Tue Jul 21 22:25:56 2015 UTC,"FYI: I went to Target yesterday and asked if I could price match the $55 headset from walmart.com AND use the 15% off coupon from Target's cartwheel app. I was told they would only allow both if I was price matching from target.com. So it was either price match $55 OR get 15% off $89.99. However, I know that someone else on here was able to do both. Guess it depends who you talk to!"
PS4Deals,3e4970,soleilvie,2,Tue Jul 21 23:09:23 2015 UTC,"I did this yesterday, I had them price match the 55 From Walmart and was able to receive the 15% cartwheel discount and another 5% for my red card .. Came to like $45  prior to tax"
PS4Deals,3e4970,M4db34v312,2,Tue Jul 21 23:50:44 2015 UTC,"Did you ask them first if they would do both or did you just go to the register, say you want to price match, then showed them the coupon on cartwheel when you were about to pay? I wonder if that would make a difference. I asked the guy in electronics if they would do both and he went through like two levels of management before telling me they wouldn't do it."
PS4Deals,3e4970,soleilvie,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:03:56 2015 UTC,"At the target I work at, they will do this for a guest. It just depends, like you said!"
PS4Deals,3e4970,tnhellbilly,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:20:17 2015 UTC,$55 at Walmart. I'm sure Target would price match.   http://www.walmart.com/ip/34557977
PS4Deals,3e1vaf,ezpricealerts,4,Tue Jul 21 08:56:23 2015 UTC,And of course the digital version is still $59.99... fuck you too sony or whoever is the digital price setter.
PS4Deals,3e1vaf,ninjate,2,Tue Jul 21 17:12:08 2015 UTC,"""Let us give you a disc and box for $40 less"" I never understood that shit. Digital should be cheaper, in theory there is unlimited inventory of that"
PS4Deals,3e1vaf,SteeezyE,2,Tue Jul 21 17:31:16 2015 UTC,The reason is obvious: stocking and handling cost of the physical copy (i.e.: this box takes some space which could be used by an other item with a higher profit margin) combined with competition/free-market. On the digital side seller doesn't have things they need to get off their hands and there is a single point of distribution: PS Store.  But come on you shouldn't go on insulting the customer like this.
PS4Deals,3e1vaf,ninjate,0,Tue Jul 21 17:50:04 2015 UTC,"Seriously. People always slam digital and the prices, acting as if the people in charge are idiots, when they themselves can't comprehend basic economics nor management accounting."
PS4Deals,3e1vaf,ImThatGuyYouDontKnow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:10:50 2015 UTC,At $20. It's worth it. Now the game has a patch on console to use the entire screen. No more 16:9 format.
PS4Deals,3e1vaf,hardangelfan,5,Tue Jul 21 13:32:51 2015 UTC,Which lowers the quality of textures apparently and the game has a questionable performance in the first place
PS4Deals,3e1vaf,IFaponit,-4,Tue Jul 21 14:14:31 2015 UTC,"It shouldn't change anything.  The game always rendered behind the black bars before, so any change is purely placebo."
PS4Deals,3e1vaf,TheAntagonisticDildo,0,Tue Jul 21 14:54:41 2015 UTC,This is false.
PS4Deals,3e1vaf,ecstatic_waffle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:15:56 2015 UTC,Oops my bad.  I was thinking of The Order which does that.
PS4Deals,3e1vaf,TheAntagonisticDildo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:20:14 2015 UTC,This game any good? Is it scary?
PS4Deals,3e1vaf,ManiacApple,-4,Tue Jul 21 18:19:46 2015 UTC,"No, and no."

PS4Deals,3dzklp,Basic85,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:28:40 2015 UTC,So I grabbed this deal. Just set up my account right now for it but after I confirmed my purchase I haven't yet gotten a confirmation email. Maybe I'm spoiled by steam instant emails but its been like 15 minutes. Does Groupon not send confirmation emails?  EDIT: For those also looking to grab this deal today (last today to lock in this deal Price) it takes a few hours for the charge to be reviewed by their team then you get the email. After tax it was $364.12. They had a customer support line that answered all my questions on their process.(888-664-4482) Great deal

PS4Deals,3dydcc,Johnny_Guano,3,Mon Jul 20 15:29:25 2015 UTC,Also the shipping is god awful slow. Took 2 weeks I think. For domestic shipping. And I'm used to Amazon prime.
PS4Deals,3dydcc,Timothy_Duggan25,2,Mon Jul 20 21:17:38 2015 UTC,"Was it? I got my order in a couple of days, so I can't complain about that; however, they really tried to give me the brush off ... amazingly so. E.g. I tell them Sony says it's not covered under warranty and are sending back my peripheral, and then they come back to me saying ""yes it is covered, Sony is wrong."" um WTF!! I eventually had to send them emails showing conclusively that Sony said ""No Warranty.""  The other part of the equation, which I didn't really mention, is that Sony's customer service may be the worst I've ever experienced of any company."
PS4Deals,3dydcc,Johnny_Guano,3,Mon Jul 20 23:00:10 2015 UTC,"Sony's customer service is really bad.  They're super condescending.  I had to deal with them for the first time recently when I accidentally bought a PSP game and I don't own a PSP.  The dude lectured me about looking at the platforms before making a purchase, and that he might be able to get me a refund, but it would be a one-time deal.  How about don't show me games that I don't have the system for?  Or a popup warning telling me this game is not for the currently used system.  The game cost $2.50.  It was a simple mistake when I was buying a bunch of games on sale."
PS4Deals,3dydcc,Timothy_Duggan25,2,Mon Jul 20 23:41:41 2015 UTC,"They're like a small govt at this point really ... so they don't need to be logical or polite. The fact that they keep getting hacked is both amazing and not surprising considering my experience with them. They sent my controller 3 times before I actually received it, One time they sent it to my PSN id which I specifically warned them not to do. It actually came to my building and was sent back.  Cap'n Buttmunch or Bud Smoker is not a real name you know, duh. But if they keep getting hacked like they do, they could be pretty much finished or at least severely handicapped."

PS4Deals,3dygjw,gus2155,3,Mon Jul 20 18:15:59 2015 UTC,For that price its good. Got it day 1 and I was hooked as I'm a huge fan of pro wrestling but after a while it got boring and repetitive. Kinda mad i got at 48$ cause 18$ seems much better
PS4Deals,3dygjw,role34,3,Mon Jul 20 19:07:19 2015 UTC,Got me some Dying Light and Call of Duty. For the price I figured I'd check out the campaign of AW. Is the multiplayer community still lively?
PS4Deals,3dygjw,RudyBagels,3,Mon Jul 20 18:28:23 2015 UTC,"As with all call of duty games, you should find plenty of matches until the game gets 3-4 years old. The game plays good, just get ready for squeakers"
PS4Deals,3dygjw,JamesMighty,2,Mon Jul 20 20:58:06 2015 UTC,I'm looking into picking up dying light and shadows of mordor but are they work waiting to get the special editions with all the DLC or just get the base game?
PS4Deals,3dygjw,wings994,2,Mon Jul 20 17:45:49 2015 UTC,"Hows the campaign in Far Cry 4? How's the open world gameplay? Is it too repetitive, like AC? Thats what the reviews seem to say.  I know it can never be as good as GTA, but is it worth playing?"
PS4Deals,3dygjw,chandleross,2,Mon Jul 20 17:54:21 2015 UTC,"I found myself wandering around and spending much more time in the open world than doing missions, and I'm not fond of AC"
PS4Deals,3dygjw,IMarkMyWordsI,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:02:09 2015 UTC,"FC4 was perfect for me because it was a more polished FC3, which was one of my favorite games last gen. The game, to me, became slightly repetitive (towards the last few missions I sort of was peeking ahead to see how many more I had to complete to beat the game), but there is enough side stuff to do to break the monotony including just exploring and hunting/looking for odd or unique stuff going on around the island.   The gameplay was fun enough for me to go back and earn the platinum trophy well after I had completed the main campaign, which isn't always something I can say about games (AC: Unity, for one, although I enjoyed that game as well). I felt the 50-60 hours I got out of this game made the $39.99 I paid in December an afterthought."
PS4Deals,3dygjw,gopacktennie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:19:17 2015 UTC,"It is definitely worth playing. I had a LOT of fun with it. If you liked the gameplay of FC3, you'll like FC4.  However, the campaign isn't great. The ending is pretty eh and the antagonists aren't well developed at all. You rarely see them or get to know them and most of them are pretty forgetful.  That said, the open world is decent. It's somewhat nagging at times, but it's not bad. It's sometimes overwhelming, but it's all optional and you can choose to do whatever you want.  In my opinion, it's a solid 8/10. Worth playing, and a lot of fun."
PS4Deals,3dygjw,Rytlock,2,Mon Jul 20 22:05:04 2015 UTC,"SPOILER:   When I finished the game and had to pick between two fucked up people, I picked Sabal and when I went to see him on the island I massacred EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. The game doesn't say you can do this, but you can.   To me that's the true ending. You become president AND the leader of the Golden Path. Fuck both of them."

PS4Deals,3dulw9,Victorbanner,26,Tue Jul 21 18:33:00 2015 UTC,"This ""deal"" is such ass."
PS4Deals,3dulw9,Vykim223,6,Sun Jul 19 18:56:44 2015 UTC,"It's EB Games, what did you expect? They stopped having worthwhile promos years ago when I stopped shopping there."
PS4Deals,3dulw9,chdude3,2,Sun Jul 19 20:38:27 2015 UTC,"True. I haven't shopped there in years also. Hell, I haven't purchased any video games from a retail store in years.  However, this wouldn't be too bad if it was for an xbox one also considering they did announce that they are working on backward compatibility for 360 titles."
PS4Deals,3dulw9,Vykim223,2,Sun Jul 19 21:16:50 2015 UTC,I'm really intrigued by the backwards compatibility. I was 360 (and PC) last gen. I got an XB1 but was really disappointed and hopped to PS4 after a few months. I'm hoping the Streaming and Back Compat will give me reason to give the One another chance.
PS4Deals,3dulw9,chdude3,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:30:05 2015 UTC,Same but I came from PS3 and PC to PS4 and only played 360 with my roommate since he'd only have sports/fps for it.   If backward compatibility is executed well I might have a reason to get a xone. Get the best of both worlds.
PS4Deals,3dulw9,Vykim223,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:15:50 2015 UTC,Oh please. Find any large retail store running 'worthwhile' promos on old hardware to new hardware.   Oh. Right. Gamestop was taking people's 360s and PS3s and giving them $150 for each towards a PS4 or XB1.
PS4Deals,3dulw9,Milkshakes00,5,Sun Jul 19 20:40:55 2015 UTC,"In Canada? How long ago? Microsoft was offering $100 maybe a month ago for any PS3 or 360 against an XB1, while EB would only take the newest models.   Sorry but in general, EB's promos have drastically declined over the past 5 years or so. While they are one of the few chains to do hardware trade-ins, the values are sad and you're much better off with a private sale."

PS4Deals,3dulw9,ImReddit,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:39:02 2015 UTC,To get to 99$ you have to trade in a Xbox one and 5 games worth 8$ or more. Not much of a deal.

PS4Deals,3dqxlz,poitinpdx,3,Sat Jul 18 23:46:18 2015 UTC,I agree to an extent. I wouldn't necessarily want to walk around a major metro with this on my back. I ordered it as a way to safely transport my PS4 during an upcoming move. I figure it will be convenient if I occasionally want to take my console to a friend's house or something.
PS4Deals,3dqxlz,Sgt_ZigZag,10,Sat Jul 18 19:05:43 2015 UTC,My ps4 fits just fine in a regular backpack. If it's just for occasional use I wouldn't bother paying $50 for this to be honest.
PS4Deals,3dqxlz,VDr4g0n,5,Sat Jul 18 19:35:02 2015 UTC,"Agreed. If it's not snug inside your backpack, fill it with old shirts or something. $50 is still quite expensive imo."
PS4Deals,3dqxlz,DagoDingo,2,Sat Jul 18 19:53:34 2015 UTC,Agreed. I use a low key Targus that works perfect.
PS4Deals,3dqxlz,interneb,3,Sat Jul 18 20:55:38 2015 UTC,"These are great for transportation. I got one to make moving easier. Was able to fit my PS4, games, controllers, charging stands in with no issue.  Great, well worth the price."
PS4Deals,3dqxlz,ctrlaltd1337,3,Sun Jul 19 07:03:06 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm the only person who kept their OEM box? It just sits in my storage closet and when I bring it somewhere, I pack it up."

PS4Deals,3dnw56,Golden_Taint,22,Fri Jul 17 20:18:15 2015 UTC,The handsome collection is a steal for the  price. The amount of content it brings and the amount of fun to be had is way too high.
PS4Deals,3dnw56,Flameout3145,7,Fri Jul 17 20:42:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the review! Would you say it is worth the price for single player mode? I don't have PS+, although couch co-op would be nice with my friends."
PS4Deals,3dnw56,chandleross,10,Fri Jul 17 21:46:25 2015 UTC,The Borderlands games are at their most entertaining point when playing with friends.  The single player mode is hit or miss dependent upon what you enjoy in gaming. It can feel ultra grindy (which to be fair the game is built upon) and less fun without others.
PS4Deals,3dnw56,Steamified,7,Fri Jul 17 22:03:28 2015 UTC,Single player is fantastic in its own right! But co-op play is just as exciting!
PS4Deals,3dnw56,TheLastOfUsAll,4,Fri Jul 17 22:00:32 2015 UTC,Borderlands has been my favorite series of the past decade! I actually play single player about 95% of the time.   Sooooooo good!
PS4Deals,3dnw56,AmeriChaos,3,Fri Jul 17 22:14:39 2015 UTC,"It's definitely worth it for single player. I used to play it on my own and would have a bunch of fun. This is also one of the best couch coop games out there, so if your going for that, this game is perfect for you."
PS4Deals,3dnw56,Flameout3145,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:30:17 2015 UTC,"Without a doubt it's worth it! I played it solo on my 360, although it's hard as balls playing solo it wasn't a deterrent.  It's tons of fun and I'm debating jumping on this as well but my save is on 360 and I have too many other games to rip through to start this one over. Grab it man, you won't be disappointed."
PS4Deals,3dnw56,StopnFrisk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:35:00 2015 UTC,The only problem single player is the difficulty but if you have friends it's much easier :)
PS4Deals,3dnw56,catspacecrusader,7,Sat Jul 18 05:08:32 2015 UTC,"Can anyone give me the skinny on the Alien Isolation DLC? Used hard copies of the game alone are going for <$20, so I'm trying to figure out if its all worth the $36."
PS4Deals,3dnw56,jcal0032,3,Fri Jul 17 21:54:44 2015 UTC,I've heard that the DLC is pretty much just a collection of challenge rooms.
PS4Deals,3dnw56,kotogo,3,Sat Jul 18 11:50:00 2015 UTC,I am also interested in this information. I held off buying a stand alone copy earlier this week for $21 hoping this season pass bundle would be $25 or less. At $36 I'm not really interested unless someone can sell me on how great the DLC is.
PS4Deals,3dnw56,eyre,2,Sat Jul 18 02:50:58 2015 UTC,Take this with a grain of salt as I have not played Alien Isolation at all. But everything I've read makes the DLC sound like it's pretty bad (not good). Even the comments I've seen that are positive mention how very short it is.
PS4Deals,3dnw56,darewind,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:30:11 2015 UTC,I own the game and the season pass on Steam.The DLC is not worth the price unless you are a huge fan of challenge maps or the pursuit of the highscore on a scoreboard.The Crew Expendable and Last surivor are decent but did not justify the season pass price to me.If I were to purchase the game on PS4 it would be a sub $20 base game version or the complete (all DLC) for under $25.
PS4Deals,3dnw56,FrattyMcpherson,4,Sun Jul 19 02:22:48 2015 UTC,I'm  glad that I missed out on the BL:HC on prime day. For 30 bucks here I come
PS4Deals,3dnw56,brokerthrowaway,4,Fri Jul 17 22:20:26 2015 UTC,"This is probably a stupid question, but can this be bought through Sony without owning a PS4 just yet? I'm getting mine soon and really want this game."
PS4Deals,3dnw56,Am5tagar,9,Sat Jul 18 01:43:24 2015 UTC,"Yep! As long as you've created a PSN account, you can buy the game. Once you get your PS4 and log in with your account, you can download any games on your account."
PS4Deals,3dnw56,bnoonan037,2,Sat Jul 18 01:59:06 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure you can get it through the website or the app, but I am not sure"
PS4Deals,3dnw56,CaptainPick1e,2,Sat Jul 18 01:59:20 2015 UTC,"I think its store.playstation.com and as long as you have an account, you can purchase it."
PS4Deals,3dnw56,brokerthrowaway,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:18:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can. Also, if you plan on getting PS+, you can do that, and ""buy"" all of the free games for this month, and download them when you get your PS4."
PS4Deals,3dnw56,CaptainPick1e,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:22:39 2015 UTC,Hmm do I need to wait to get my console to get my free month of PS+ you think? Or do I need to buy a card first?
PS4Deals,3dnw56,brokerthrowaway,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:47:45 2015 UTC,"No- As long as you make the account, you don't even need a console. You would just buy a card and redeem the code or purchase a a subscription online. If you are getting the console within the month, you'll be fine. Right now though, Rocket League is free, and tons of fun."
PS4Deals,3dnw56,CitrusLikeAnOrange,2,Sat Jul 18 20:34:05 2015 UTC,Yeah! I really want that game!
PS4Deals,3dnw56,pr0adam,5,Sat Jul 18 21:48:03 2015 UTC,Is there any benefit to the digital version of BL:HC? I prefer discs over digital and used copies are going for about $35-40 but I don't wanna miss any content.
PS4Deals,3dnw56,99hundred,5,Fri Jul 17 21:13:01 2015 UTC,"Nope. They both take up same amount of hdd apace. No benefit to disc over digital except for being able to lend it, bring it around or sell it."

PS4Deals,3dnw56,CitrusLikeAnOrange,2,Sun Jul 19 00:11:32 2015 UTC,"Benefit to digital: if you're playing something else, and a friend comes online and wants to play, you don't have to swap disks"
PS4Deals,3dnw56,Nawara_Ven,5,Fri Jul 17 23:25:00 2015 UTC,"Ehhh, I don't really mind swapping discs. Just don't wanna miss out on any digital only content."

PS4Deals,3dnw56,junyah54,4,Fri Jul 17 20:31:24 2015 UTC,Picked up Isolation at full price a while back and have been delaying my foray into it for some reason—guess I ought to have waited for the price drop with that sort of attitude.

PixelJunk Shooter is good, but not near as good as Geometry Wars 3. Still, it's not a bad call for $3 if you didn't already get it on PS+.  The Swapper is a fantastic puzzle game that was also on PS+ once upon a time. Your first playthrough will probably take 8-12 hours. This game is also only $3."
PS4Deals,3dnw56,ExOTiC1234,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:10:56 2015 UTC,"PixelJunk Shooter dominated nights of mine for an entire week after it dropped on PS+... would do that all over again.   I'll scope out The Swapper sometime soon, too. Justified getting Limbo again for some reason—just loved it so thoroughly on 360, I guess I needed more. Thanks for the list, friend!"
PS4Deals,3dnw56,jrno86nunez,2,Sat Jul 18 06:29:18 2015 UTC,Pixeljunk shooter and Super motherload look REALLY fun. But im bias because i really like those kind of games and i have friends on most of he time to play with.

PS4Deals,3dnw56,Nawara_Ven,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:00:18 2015 UTC,Is Metal Gear Rising Ultimate Edition worth it?
PS4Deals,3dnw56,LouisIV,2,Sat Jul 18 02:51:50 2015 UTC,"The ""Ultimate"" part is really just some DLC/pre-order skins which are interesting, but not integral. The three ""story"" DLC are all free all the time.  Metal Gear Rising: Revengence is one of the greatest action games ever made, so there's that going for it. It's high speed, high skill-ceiling, possible to beat ""perfectly"" (everything is defendable if you're good enough), and overall well-polished."
PS4Deals,3dnw56,Nawara_Ven,2,Sat Jul 18 02:58:42 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I have an unopened copy of the game, just wondering if I should resell that and grab this edition- didn't know the story missions were free. Also, you've convinced me to finally dust it off and play it! I got it last winter and have been putting it off."
PS4Deals,3dnw56,SkaMateria,2,Sat Jul 18 03:00:27 2015 UTC,"No prob! Yeah, the story DLCs (which are great, too) were originally like $10 each upon release, but then went free about 8 months after they came out... not sure why.

PS4Deals,3dnng3,Rytlock,9,Mon Jul 20 22:11:57 2015 UTC,"Definitely worth it.  This game is no longer broken.  Yes there are occasional dips in the framerate on cut scenes, and yes there are occasional pop-ins.  However, the updated free-running is so much fun.  The added depth of being able to run through buildings is awesome. I'm enjoying the story, but I understand if it isn't your thing.  I would never buy this game for $60, but at $19, I think it was a fantastic buy.  I've played it a fuck-ton in the past two weeks and fallen back in love with the series.  I won't be buying syndicate at launch if it launches the way this game did, but the improvements to the gameplay make this game so worth $20."
PS4Deals,3dnng3,the_toaster_lied,6,Fri Jul 17 22:27:09 2015 UTC,Should have made it $17.89

PS4Deals,3dnngb,AnthMike,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:21:46 2015 UTC,Thanks OP! Just landed the deal. Eager to finally dive into this masterpiece.

TLDR: create US psn account and activate as primary console. Then download it, and switch back to original account. Just tried it, and it works"
PS4Deals,3dnzbb,rick916,2,Fri Jul 17 20:42:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks, dude. I love the NFS series and have been looking forward to a NFS title on PS4."
PS4Deals,3dnzbb,kilroyishere89,2,Sun Jul 19 03:22:16 2015 UTC,This is already up on the PSN store for pre-order at $10 more. Might as well get this as it's physical (which I prefer) and it's basically a free upgrade. Thanks OP!
PS4Deals,3dnzbb,ggking1,0,Sat Jul 18 00:35:37 2015 UTC,You're welcome bro!
PS4Deals,3dnzbb,Hashtag_Heel,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:10:36 2015 UTC,"Still up... just bought it. Thanks. I had planned on buying digital the games I felt I would get the most distance out of, with Need for Speed being one of them... but I also like to save money, even if it is only $5"
PS4Deals,3dmr6q,goodbyebluemondays,6,Fri Jul 17 15:10:26 2015 UTC,"Little Big Planet - $17.99 - I am planning on getting this game eventually for me and my wife to play, but it'd be about 3 (almost 2, we're about done with Stealth Inc) games deep in our co-op backlog. Get it now at this price or wait? Does it go on sale often anywhere?"

Everything else seems to be well over the $30 range.
PS4Deals,3dmr6q,Valpo502,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:02:17 2015 UTC,I expect it to be a ps+ game at some point

PS4Deals,3dmr6q,Valpo502,3,Fri Jul 17 18:10:53 2015 UTC,FF Type 0 comes with the FFXV demo. I haven't played it yet so this is a great deal. Demo codes alone go for $25+ on eBay.

PS4Deals,3dmr6q,lveg,6,Fri Jul 17 18:02:34 2015 UTC,They must have sold out again. Seems to happen frequently with that particular game  because somebody posted it a couple of days ago and the same thing happened. Give it a day or two and I am sure they will have more available.
PS4Deals,3dmr6q,dhalloffame,2,Fri Jul 17 18:06:29 2015 UTC,Aw too bad. Thanks mate.
PS4Deals,3dmr6q,lveg,2,Fri Jul 17 18:10:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I tried getting Shadows of Mordor on sale at Best Buy the other day, but it was only available for instore pickup, and my local store didn't have it."
PS4Deals,3dmr6q,dhalloffame,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:04:57 2015 UTC,Ordered it myself as well. Can't beat that free shipping! Gamefly has really impressed me with these deals. The layout to their website is easy to scroll through as well. Enjoy the game.

PS4Deals,3dmr6q,brokerthrowaway,4,Fri Jul 17 18:33:09 2015 UTC,Cases are brand new and discs are typically flawless.
PS4Deals,3dmr6q,brokerthrowaway,3,Fri Jul 17 18:46:35 2015 UTC,I only buy used games through GameFly. The disc is flawless and the case is mint because they send the disc in a sleeve when you rent it so they don't get damaged 10/10 service too. I feel bad I don't subscribe haha.
PS4Deals,3dmr6q,ManWithAPIan,2,Fri Jul 17 18:59:26 2015 UTC,Very good to hear! Just got Unity

This has been a good week, picked up Dying Light, Bloodborne and Shadow of Modor for less than the price of 1 new game. These gamefly sales are actually getting me interested in my PS4 again."
PS4Deals,3dmr6q,chirperic,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:38:34 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up, I found Shadow of Mordor sort of boring. Let me know how you like it."

Combat against the regular people is really easy, but whenever one of those fucking wildebeest things runs up I can't fucking kill it and I get pissed and quit. I prob just need to play more and get better."
PS4Deals,3dmr6q,jdpn24,2,Fri Jul 17 16:41:09 2015 UTC,send a charged headshot and it'll die instantly  also use stealth to your advantage and sprinting can also help you..you are faster than them and running away and hiding can be a good strategy sometimes lol

PS4Deals,3dmig2,rastacola,2,Fri Jul 17 15:46:41 2015 UTC,What is smile amazon?
PS4Deals,3dmig2,OriginalUneeK,6,Fri Jul 17 16:44:48 2015 UTC,0.5% of the revenue Amazon receives from your purchased items go to a charity of your choice.
PS4Deals,3dmig2,goodbyebluemondays,3,Fri Jul 17 17:02:06 2015 UTC,"That's awesome! Is it listed when you go on Amazons site? Or do you put in the address bar, smile. Amazon. Com?"
PS4Deals,3dmig2,OriginalUneeK,5,Fri Jul 17 17:03:13 2015 UTC,you got it :) http://smile.amazon.com/  I would type it in the address bar just to make sure. Happy hunting!
PS4Deals,3dmig2,goodbyebluemondays,4,Fri Jul 17 17:08:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Your a pretty cool person, have a great weekend!"
PS4Deals,3dmig2,OriginalUneeK,4,Fri Jul 17 17:10:45 2015 UTC,I use a Chrome extension called Smile Always that will redirect you do the appropriate Amazon Smile page even if you click on a normal Amazon link.
PS4Deals,3dmig2,goodbyebluemondays,4,Fri Jul 17 17:21:29 2015 UTC,I appreciate that! You do the same!
PS4Deals,3dmig2,brokerthrowaway,3,Fri Jul 17 18:10:08 2015 UTC,I believe purchases through smile links have some of the proceeds go to a selected charity. It does not increase the price though.
PS4Deals,3dmig2,The_right_time,3,Fri Jul 17 16:46:18 2015 UTC,I believe it is also available at Walmart for $29.99

PS4Deals,3dmig2,pilgrimz,7,Fri Jul 17 14:00:04 2015 UTC,"Definitely worth the price, and a great co-op game. My gf has gotten in to a few games with me, but this is definitely her favorite."
PS4Deals,3dmig2,subway28,3,Fri Jul 17 16:25:10 2015 UTC,I got my girlfriend into playing it and we've been enjoying it. $30 is a good deal since stores still have it for $50.
PS4Deals,3dmig2,FuntimeBen,3,Fri Jul 17 16:10:41 2015 UTC,"I've seen you on here a couple times posting comments about your wife, trying to find games for both of you to play. I have a similar problem with my girlfriend... But your wife seems to have similar taste as my girlfriend and I wanted to mention that we recently picked up ""The Golf Club"". My girlfriend didn't care for it at first but after one round she loved it, it's fast and easy and simple to play. It can also be challenging for you if you ever wanted to play alone. The commentator is pretty great too. She also loves Rocket League! So check those out my friend."
PS4Deals,3dmig2,dontdodrugsbitch,4,Fri Jul 17 17:08:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks to the comments in the thread I made, I ordered Knack and went ahead and ordered Diablo 3. I figure even if she doesn't like it I will. I don't know if either of us would enjoy a golf game, but I'll check out some reviews for it when we're ready to move onto another game later in the year."
PS4Deals,3dmig2,MZITF,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:25:34 2015 UTC,She will probably dig it. My wife had a ball with it as it mechanically very satisfying. One of my favorite PS4 experiences.

I will check my local store if they update stock in the near future, then I will just return it and get the one I was supposed to."

PS4Deals,3dkfyi,HudsonSir,2,Fri Jul 17 14:54:54 2015 UTC,"I've heard this game was below expectations, but is it a fun play through for this price? My ps4 gets here today, and I'm looking for some fun, cheap games for it."

PS4Deals,3dj54i,ac1drain_,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:23:00 2015 UTC,It's not bad to check out from time to time. Especially when a title you want comes out since sometimes you'll get a steal if they have a deal. Other times it's just a typical discounted rate you'll see all over the internet.

PS4Deals,3dj54i,madbubers,2,Fri Jul 17 13:21:26 2015 UTC,"I agree, especially with the 500gb model, memory gets eaten up fast. I figured though that this will be one of maybe two games that I will concede to download because of how good it is. Hopefully it won't bite me in the ass in the future with all the free games/content being given away on the PSN. But if it does, at that point I may be willing to invest in one of those external hard drives."
PS4Deals,3dj54i,Spjs,3,Fri Jul 17 15:00:05 2015 UTC,"In case you haven't read up on it, physical copies take up the exact same amount of space on your HDD as digital copies.    All games need to have a mandatory installation, regardless if it's on disc."

PS4Deals,3did6s,wings994,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:38:13 2015 UTC,I own the season pass. Not worth the $20. Best content are free updates adding new weapons. DLC is boring.
PS4Deals,3did6s,ZerosevEx,2,Fri Jul 17 00:39:17 2015 UTC,This is an awesome game! I actually miss it and plan on going back next weekend after i finish batman.

PS4Deals,3dh73u,WilBeCoding,6,Thu Jul 16 16:01:00 2015 UTC,"This is what pissed me off more than their shitty deals. I wasn't even going after something that was in high demand(or so I thought) and I clicked 'add to cart' right when the deal went live and it said 100% claimed and waitlist is full right after I clicked.   Bullshit.   I love Amazon and I love Prime, but damn."
PS4Deals,3dh73u,kilroyishere89,4,Thu Jul 16 16:17:00 2015 UTC,Agreed. They took the shit people dont like about black Friday and made it digital.

PS4Deals,3dh73u,kingslayershand,9,Thu Jul 16 16:30:21 2015 UTC,"Time to take a nap, if I may say so. Thanks everyone, this was fun :)"
PS4Deals,3dh73u,laccro,3,Thu Jul 16 07:00:39 2015 UTC,Big thanks to the community here--I picked up the bundle thanks to your recommendation and subbed to r/PS4Deals!
PS4Deals,3dh73u,sambalaya,4,Thu Jul 16 17:01:51 2015 UTC,"This sub is great! The megathread was great to discuss deals, prepare for them, and occasionally complain together about how fast they sold out. Thank you to the mod(s) of a pretty darn helpful sub."
PS4Deals,3dh73u,Irsaan,3,Thu Jul 16 11:29:49 2015 UTC,Thank YOU. Because of this sub I snagged a few Prime Day deals as well as many others. Take your bow (audience applauds).
PS4Deals,3dh73u,vicecommander,2,Thu Jul 16 11:56:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you!! If it wasn't for this awesome place, I would have never gotten the ps vita for my bro, he is so happy!"
PS4Deals,3dh73u,granbambino,2,Thu Jul 16 15:40:20 2015 UTC,"If it weren't for Prime Day, I wouldn't have bought a PS4. Black Friday certainly came early for me, as for the rest of you."
PS4Deals,3dh73u,ShinobiZilla,2,Thu Jul 16 15:58:41 2015 UTC,"Great thread yesterday. Loved hunting for deals with others here, and sharing the disappointment and joys when it came to the deals."
PS4Deals,3dh73u,baliwala,3,Thu Jul 16 17:57:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for everyone who posted deals for those of us from work. It allowed me to find the things I care about most through my app. Mind you, I didn't get everything I wanted but at least I didn't have to spend all day on my phone at work to find a single deal..."
PS4Deals,3dh73u,ddmeightball,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:10:54 2015 UTC,What happened to the walmart deals? Wth
PS4Deals,3dh73u,warlock777,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:31:36 2015 UTC,That was fun. Lots of good conversation.
PS4Deals,3dh73u,Brawlz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:20:06 2015 UTC,It was pretty underwhelming. Bring a flask next year!
PS4Deals,3dimh6,OneLuckyContestant,8,Thu Jul 16 15:57:47 2015 UTC,How has this game not hit the $30 mark yet?
PS4Deals,3dimh6,LargePizza_DietCoke,15,Fri Jul 17 02:49:48 2015 UTC,"Is this even really a deal? I mean, this game has been out in the US for just under 2 years! I think its kind of ridiculous that its still getting a sales point at $50."
PS4Deals,3dimh6,Freezerboard,2,Thu Jul 16 22:32:03 2015 UTC,"Not the lowest price ever, but I thought I'd post it since discounts seem to be rare on this game for some reason."
PS4Deals,3dimh6,dogonnics,4,Thu Jul 16 15:59:04 2015 UTC,Does anyone know why it is still so high??
PS4Deals,3dimh6,bear2008,7,Thu Jul 16 22:51:32 2015 UTC,really popular still
PS4Deals,3dimh6,DabbieDavis,3,Thu Jul 16 23:36:12 2015 UTC,Because it is still worth it.
PS4Deals,3dimh6,savior6,3,Sat Jul 18 14:55:44 2015 UTC,Might be better to go off ebates for 5% cash back through Walmart if they're still the same price
PS4Deals,3dimh6,CaptainPick1e,3,Thu Jul 16 18:46:21 2015 UTC,"This game needs to go on sale more often. I've seen it on ""sale"" on steam- It was still $60, but it included the game plus some in game currency."
PS4Deals,3dimh6,Edw1nner,3,Fri Jul 17 03:43:26 2015 UTC,That's why it seems like the price hasn't dropped.  They just keep adding more in game currency with it.
PS4Deals,3dimh6,x504xBEASTx,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:02:54 2015 UTC,I have gotten a lot mOre out of my gta than i have any other game. Bloodborne was my only other justifiable purchase.  Everything else i bought didn't get the time:money ratio i like to see. If you're wondering about getting it now is the time humane labs heist is double $ and rp this week.

PS4Deals,3dhyq0,Obskyo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:39:15 2015 UTC,PS4s are not region locked right? So would there be a downside to just having this shipped to the U.S.?
PS4Deals,3dhyq0,TheLegendaryGent,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:16:49 2015 UTC,"I think it'd be a lot more expensive. According to Google, £300 is about $470 (Even if you take off the 20% VAT, that's about $380 without shipping, and I have no idea how the taxes would work), and then there's shipping on top as well. I'd recommend getting a US deal."
PS4Deals,3dh6lj,Golden_Taint,2,Thu Jul 16 06:17:56 2015 UTC,I believe that it doesn't work for the Arkham Knight bundle
PS4Deals,3dh6lj,ArizonaSecrets,2,Thu Jul 16 15:35:20 2015 UTC,"I jumped, a Last of Us bundle with enough money for two nearly free games, not to mention I get to choose the ""free"" games is sweet"

PS4Deals,3dh6lj,AshbySea,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:01:40 2015 UTC,For some reason the link quits working direct to the PS4. Offer is still good though if you search for it and add to cart.
PS4Deals,3dh6lj,AshbySea,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:51:40 2015 UTC,I didn't see the GC offer in the checkout either though
PS4Deals,3dh6lj,AshbySea,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:48:07 2015 UTC,"Here's a screen shot, I just added it to cart and it's still there, deal still good through 7/20. It only works on the TLOU $399 console, not the Arkham"
PS4Deals,3dh6lj,AshbySea,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:30:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I think it might be because I'm using my phone"
PS4Deals,3dh6lj,SumoGirls,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:52:55 2015 UTC,"Ah, I'll bet that's it. Yeah, killer deal to get the $100. And if you order this, take my advice and do the free Dell Advantage sign up. You'll get free 2 day shipping plus an extra 5% back in a eGift card ($20)."
PS4Deals,3dh6lj,AshbySea,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:00:01 2015 UTC,"Word, I'll look into it like meow"
PS4Deals,3dh6lj,SumoGirls,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:25:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not seeing it on mobile either. Going to give it a go on my desktop in an hour or so."
PS4Deals,3dh6lj,barnebz,2,Sun Jul 19 22:57:13 2015 UTC,"It works, they also have a gold headset, The Last of Us and Gta V for $500. I still went with the original post deal."
PS4Deals,3dh6lj,ToastyKabal,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:03:28 2015 UTC,Does this deal still work?
PS4Deals,3dh6lj,ToastyKabal,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:09:58 2015 UTC,Yep! Through tomorrow. Ans take my advice and sign up for Dell Advantage for the extra 5% gift card and the free 2 day shipping.
PS4Deals,3dh6lj,HouseDraagnaj,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:19:48 2015 UTC,I ordered this but didn't recall seeing confirmation when I checked out. So I emailed them and asked them to confirm that I would get the gift card. They said I did not qualify and didn't tell me what the qualifications were. Does anybody know what the qualification are I couldn't find them on the site?
PS4Deals,3dh6lj,Cazan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:22:10 2015 UTC,"I just checked the site and that deal is not live. When did you place your order? Did you confirm that the gift card was in your cart after you added the PS4? It did not show up on mobile, you had to log from a desktop. If they are not giving you the gift card, then I would cancel the order. You can get the vanilla console for much cheaper from somewhere else."
PS4Deals,3dh6lj,HouseDraagnaj,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:09:09 2015 UTC,"I ordered this on Thursday.  Dell canceled my order for having different shipping and billing addresses.  The cancelation didn't show until monday, after the promo was over.  Customer service just jerked me around on the issue.  So much for a good deal."
PS4Deals,3dh6lj,Zathu,2,Wed Jul 22 01:04:49 2015 UTC,"Just skip it and do the Groupon deal, you'll save more money up front. Sorry it's been a hassle, I know that sucks."
PS4Deals,3dh6lj,Phandemonium,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:42:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I actually just bought one from Groupon before seeing your comment.  Had to use my debit account because Dell already has my credit card tied up enough."
PS4Deals,3dh6lj,EverGreenPLO,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:05:58 2015 UTC,"Notes: The gift card shows up as a code in your email, takes about 15 days from ship date to arrive. Good only on Dell.com, usually has an expiration date about 3 months out. But great for getting extra games.  Also, the have a free program called ""Dell Advantage"" which is free to sign up for. The big benefit is free 2nd day air shipping. Seriously, like Amazon Prime except for free."
PS4Deals,3dg71i,mcwlam,5,Thu Jul 16 00:44:45 2015 UTC,"Not the best discount for store gift cards, but eBay and PayPal is running this promotion to get $15 off when you purchase $100 in gift cards.  PlayStation store gift cards are included in this deal"
PS4Deals,3dg71i,insane08,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:46:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the heads up, its still valid. Figured i'll be buying THPS 5 and Until Dawn soon enough so why not just do this and pre order via psn now."
PS4Deals,3dg71i,Shindo989,2,Thu Jul 16 21:24:45 2015 UTC,Digital Delivery too. which is good for us Australians
PS4Deals,3dg71i,dwnz1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:32:23 2015 UTC,Unfortunately requires a US Paypal account to complete transaction.
PS4Deals,3dg71i,Shindo989,4,Thu Jul 16 07:18:12 2015 UTC,"Create one, I did a while ago.  Just go to gmail, create a new email account. Then using you vpn/hola/proxy set to the USA sign up for a paypal account with your new gmail account. Set an address of a hotel or such in Oregon (to avoid sales tax) and Bobs your uncle."
PS4Deals,3dg71i,dwnz1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:31:40 2015 UTC,"I tried that, but it won't accept my credit card, as my credit card is not from the US (but I did use an Oregon address on both the account and the card)."

My hatred of PayPal aside, they are generally pretty good about getting your money back if it turns our that you got scammed"

PS4Deals,3dg71i,flamingo44,2,Thu Jul 16 03:32:50 2015 UTC,Paypal digital gifts are a side part of PP. Totally legit. I have bought off them a few times before.

PS4Deals,3dg71i,ActionFlank,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:31:39 2015 UTC,Is there a limited amount you can buy? I purchased $100 worth yesterday. Thought I should get another $100 and it keeps telling me it's expired.
PS4Deals,3dg71i,bossman-CT,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:04:36 2015 UTC,Looks like it is limited to 2 $50 cards per eBay account. If you try adding more than two in quantity field at time of purchase it shows the 2 card limit.
PS4Deals,3de4gt,dthunterx,2,Wed Jul 15 15:42:40 2015 UTC,"Is stand alone part of the title, or can I play this without owning Tlou?"
PS4Deals,3de4gt,SuckmyCrockPot,0,Wed Jul 15 16:37:29 2015 UTC,"exactly what stand alone means, you don't need the last of us game to play it."
PS4Deals,3de4gt,jrlionheart00,-4,Wed Jul 15 17:19:44 2015 UTC,I believe you would have to own TLOF as this particular download is a DLC. It is a prequel to the events in the full game.
PS4Deals,3de4gt,DJXiej,8,Wed Jul 15 16:58:47 2015 UTC,stand alone means its its own entity. The Level would be DLC
PS4Deals,3de4gt,Pyrocy779,2,Wed Jul 15 17:20:23 2015 UTC,"question, what exactly is this? i own tlou already, is this an entirely separate game?"
PS4Deals,3de4gt,dewzy916,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:32:34 2015 UTC,If you have the ps4 version it should already be included with the game
PS4Deals,3de4gt,T1ker,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:31:08 2015 UTC,Also accoeding to my remasterd addition the original game should be done first to avoid spoilers.
PS4Deals,3de4gt,Jayc333,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:47:37 2015 UTC,Cdkey has entire game with DLC for less than $15. I bought mine from Rakuten for $13 a week ago.
PS4Deals,3de4gt,Vykim223,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:07:10 2015 UTC,That's actually a pretty good deal. Too bad TLOU is one title I HAD to get a physical copy for.

PS4Deals,3ddv4n,ExOTiC1234,2,Thu Jul 16 14:28:44 2015 UTC,this was back in Feb-March but im pretty sure the devs said so
PS4Deals,3ddv4n,ForbiddenWonder8,2,Thu Jul 16 20:54:57 2015 UTC,At work.  Is it good?  What kind of gameplay?
PS4Deals,3ddv4n,Inframidi,2,Wed Jul 15 15:22:48 2015 UTC,"Has amazing xray style scenes when you kill a guy. You can shoot individual balls off. YouTube when you can, it's something."

PS4Deals,3ddv4n,explos1onshurt,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:56:03 2015 UTC,"For this price..  about worth it. I love the series but the second game was waaaay better than this.

PS4Deals,3ddv4n,_Acid,0,Wed Jul 15 18:16:21 2015 UTC,"I don't know it very well. But if you had played any sniper kind of games on your phone or tablet, it will probably be a beefier graphic version of that with a making sense campaign rather than single missions costing you energies."
PS4Deals,3ddv4n,j0nnyboy,3,Wed Jul 15 15:46:10 2015 UTC,Not the best comparison

PS4Deals,3dcvke,wehopeuchoke,20,Wed Jul 15 15:42:35 2015 UTC,Just get it for $200 refurbished directly to you from Nintendo. Comes with a year warranty and basically everyone says the quality is like as good as new.
PS4Deals,3dcvke,Roxas1012,4,Wed Jul 15 09:40:15 2015 UTC,"I know it's late responding but I just wanted to let you guys know I did purchase that along with a refurbished Mario Kart 8 plus controller for 60.  Everything looks brand new.  However,  My Wii U ate the disc first time playing it, So I sent it in for a free repair.  The fixed mine, but if they can't you get a new one.  Plus I got a new warranty for another year.  I think it was a good deal even though I had to send it in."
PS4Deals,3dcvke,NightRed_,2,Thu Jul 16 00:17:57 2015 UTC,Same here... looking to get my son one for his bday next month.  The lowest I seen them was $275 at Amazon (Reg sale) & Bestbuy

PS4Deals,3dcvke,Xonim,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:43:40 2015 UTC,I'm thinking it will be $399 as well. Do you think those games will be easy to sell? I already own the PC versions of those games. Hoping to get $50 for each.
PS4Deals,3dcvke,jtansley,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:03:57 2015 UTC,Going to guess you'll have difficulty getting $50 seeing as how they're $48 with Best Buy's GCU.
PS4Deals,3dcvke,Griever114,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:09:35 2015 UTC,Good to know. Thanks! If I get this bundle maybe I'll go for $45

PS4Deals,3dcvke,FrumundaFondue,2,Wed Jul 15 18:19:08 2015 UTC,I had the page open and set a timer on my phone for when the deal was supposed to go live. Then I refreshed the page and got it. I guess I got lucky.
PS4Deals,3dcvke,JonnyDarko,2,Wed Jul 15 18:20:19 2015 UTC,I wanted that one more than anything but missed it.

PS4Deals,3dcvke,AlonzoMoseley,5,Wed Jul 15 08:12:20 2015 UTC,Collector's Edition of The Order for 19.99. Is it worth a pickup at that price?
PS4Deals,3dcvke,Brick_HardCheese,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:19:16 2015 UTC,"It's worth it if you trade it in and get some of that back. Sell the junk on Craigslist or something. I'm happy with the $6 I paid through GCU, when it was all worked out. It was alright, but lackluster as far as a 'game' goes and the story is nowhere as engaging as a telltale game. It's worth about a ticket to a decent 3D movie."
PS4Deals,3dcvke,Webecomemonsters,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:46:45 2015 UTC,Nice to know. I'll probably wait. Still have to finish Arkham Knight and want to replay Last of Us for PS4 before I'd get to it anyways.
PS4Deals,3dcvke,iUsedtoHadHerpes,4,Wed Jul 15 14:49:14 2015 UTC,There has got to be a better way to look through the deals than clicking left and right on this narrow slider. Am I missing something? Is there a page that lets you see more deals at once?
PS4Deals,3dcvke,Webecomemonsters,5,Wed Jul 15 15:09:31 2015 UTC,"This is how Black Friday is as well, and it makes Amazon a pain in the ass to shop from. I seem to recall the lightning deal interface used to be easier to use and then they changed it to how it is now."

PS4Deals,3dcvke,rawfanboy101,3,Wed Jul 15 07:37:40 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up, don't be afraid to check Offer Up, Craigslist, etc. in your area. A guy sold me his copy of Witcher 3 for $25. He said he literally played it once and put it down cause he didn't like it. Everything was included (even the stickers, map, and little thank you letter from CD Projekt Red) and the disc and case were basically in brand new shape. I've been playing it constantly since this past weekend it's been amazing.   What blu rays are you looking for? I've been trying to build up a steelbook collection."
PS4Deals,3dcvke,MFTWrecks,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:49:25 2015 UTC,"I live in a very small town so most of the stuff on Craigslist are like junker cars, old stereos, nick-nacks, etc. I did get lucky from a guy selling some old speakers last summer and got four nice Bose for $20, and built myself an awesome surround system for like $60. Haha, I was pretty stoked about that. I've been building my Blu-ray collection, have about 110 so far, only like 3 steelbooks (The Ring, Gladiator, Watchmen), but I'm basically grabbing childhood favorites at this point before I start really fleshing out my collection and do more blind-buys. I'm gonna grab Forrest Gump and The Princess Bride with whatever game I end up getting today."

I wasn't even interested in any of the PS4 games they were selling, but around 8 PM I saw that there were three upcoming lightning deals for 16, 32, and 64 GB flash drives. I had 40 minutes to waste until they went live, so I wasted 35 minutes and started refreshing the pages for the 32 and 64 GB ones.   At 8:40 they went live. I refreshed both pages and added to my cart...""100% claimed"". Joined waitlist...""waitlist is full"".   What the fuck is this shit? What, were they only selling two at a discount or something?"

PS4Deals,3dcvke,KrazeeDD,2,Wed Jul 15 07:37:32 2015 UTC,I think the good deals will start around 8-10..... the target audience is most likely working people with incomes so a sale on a weekday would mean letting them get to the office and have time to pull their credit cards out

PS4Deals,3d9jy0,255255255noise,24,Tue Jul 14 15:47:02 2015 UTC,"Amazon Prime Day FAQ's    Reply to this comment with any questions you need answered that you don't see answers to here. Fire away!     Do you need Amazon Prime to get these deals?  As far as we know, yes. They may offer deals to non-Prime members as well. They also offer a 30 day free trial to Prime if you haven't used the free trial before, or if it's been longer than a year (typically) since you've used a free trial.     Can you join Prime outside the US?  EDIT:  Yes. And Amazon is offering Prime deals to the following countries:  UK, US, Spain, Japan, Italy, Germany, France, and Canada. (Thanks for pointing that out.)     Will other retailers price match these prices?  This will be hit or miss. The stores that typically price match Amazon are Best Buy, Target and Walmart (Gamestop has zero price match policy). Whether these stores will match the prices tomorrow, we just don't know yet. Even if the official policy is ""no"", it will still be possible depending on the employee helping you. My pro tip as someone who price matches a lot? If you see a deal you want to match, show up as early as possible to the store you want to try it at."

PS4Deals,3d9jy0,Fiction2991,4,Wed Jul 15 14:23:06 2015 UTC,"I had a problem too. Kept saying ""Checking deal status"" or something, but after a few tries and waiting a couple of minutes it added me to the wait list.

I just ordered this, but it just added me to some waiting list (#72) but I have no idea what that means. Do I need to come back to actually order it or what? It didn't add to my cart."
PS4Deals,3d9jy0,Thraxed321,3,Wed Jul 15 14:27:35 2015 UTC,Said 0% for me too so I just kept hitting add deal to cart and then it eventually put me on the waitlist. Told me I had poor chances of getting it so I kept hitting join waitlist after that and then it added the item to the cart and I purchased it. Hopefully that doesn't cause problems.

PS4Deals,3d9rx1,Rytlock,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:06:21 2015 UTC,I had that in my cart and it sold out before I could check out -- ugh. I did pick up FC4 from that sale though.  Picking up Saints Row IV + Gat Out Of Hell in this one. For ~14 after tax :)
PS4Deals,3d9rx1,JamesMighty,3,Tue Jul 14 20:31:27 2015 UTC,"Dragon Age or Far Cry? Wait, both so cheap I'll pay the $30 lol. Great find!"
PS4Deals,3d9rx1,DudeGuy123,3,Tue Jul 14 17:44:58 2015 UTC,Far Cry for sure
PS4Deals,3d9rx1,JamesMighty,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:37:04 2015 UTC,"I bought both, heard good things about each of them and might never get a deal like this anytime soon haha"
PS4Deals,3d9rx1,buttfaceninja,2,Tue Jul 14 22:47:06 2015 UTC,What are the odds that Type O is the day one edition? I know Gamefly comes with all codes in the original case. I think I might buy it and maybe return it if its not. Does anyone know how Gamefly's return policy is?
PS4Deals,3d9rx1,hoffmanbrm,2,Tue Jul 14 17:48:06 2015 UTC,"This is on the actual game page. I would assume it comes with the used copy as well.  NOTE: The Final Fantasy XV demo code is available with purchase of this title, but not with rental."
PS4Deals,3d9rx1,Rytlock,2,Tue Jul 14 18:35:26 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure all copies of the game are still the Day One edition.
PS4Deals,3d9rx1,grrumble66,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:31:57 2015 UTC,The copy I bought last sale was the day one edition.
PS4Deals,3d9rx1,ET3RNA4,2,Wed Jul 15 00:35:29 2015 UTC,"Have yet to see Dying Light under $30, and Gamefly has it for $20...Should I pull the trigger or hold out for Amazon and Walmart's battle? I feel like it will be for $15 there for some reason."
PS4Deals,3d9rx1,ET3RNA4,2,Tue Jul 14 18:00:28 2015 UTC,Dying Light is well worth it. You will see it gone from Gamefly soon at that price. No guarantee that Amazon or Walmart will match $20.
PS4Deals,3d9rx1,ET3RNA4,2,Tue Jul 14 18:06:36 2015 UTC,"Awesome just bought it. Total comes out to $21.24, not bad!"
PS4Deals,3d9rx1,ET3RNA4,2,Tue Jul 14 18:07:58 2015 UTC,"Nope! Enjoy it, sweet game! Plus I love how games from Gamefly are in basically brand new condition!"
PS4Deals,3d9rx1,ET3RNA4,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:08:39 2015 UTC,Yeah I've bought from them before and I've never had any problems with the game. Thanks for your help/input. Now if I can just manage to start Bloodborne and The Wither 3...   :)
PS4Deals,3d9rx1,limination,2,Tue Jul 14 18:11:51 2015 UTC,"Ha! In the same boat as you are. I love game sales, but I still got Bloodborne, Shadow of Mordor, GTA 5 and Saints Row yet to play and beat. Right now my latest addiction is ESO, fantastic game!"
PS4Deals,3d9rx1,H3000,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:13:44 2015 UTC,"Oh Gosh, I have to beat Knack, Alien Isolation, Bloodborne, Witcher 3, Borderlands Collection, and now Dying Light. You could say I have a problem lol."
PS4Deals,3d9rx1,babaoreilymike,2,Tue Jul 14 18:20:50 2015 UTC,"Ha! What is your PSN name? Mine is Spidey555, feel free to add me. I forgot I still had Alien and Borderlands as well still. Yeah I usually just get games when they go on sale like this and get to them eventually unless it's a game I really want."
PS4Deals,3d9rx1,FalloutLoneWanderer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:22:56 2015 UTC,I will for sure bud! I'm exactly in the same boat.
PS4Deals,3d9rx1,babaoreilymike,2,Tue Jul 14 18:34:17 2015 UTC,"You guys sound just like me.  I need to beat AC4, InFamous Second Son, Saint's Row 4/Gat Outta Hell, Bound By Flame, and like 10 more...but I just can't stop playing Destiny lol"
PS4Deals,3d9rx1,coltsmetsfan614,2,Wed Jul 15 15:26:58 2015 UTC,Sigh. US only.
PS4Deals,3d9rx1,TokyoAi,2,Tue Jul 14 21:10:41 2015 UTC,I thought the retail version of Resident Evil Revelations 2 was just a code in the disc case? Is it an actual disc?
PS4Deals,3d9rx1,NOAHA202,3,Tue Jul 14 18:51:07 2015 UTC,The games tend to be former rentals so I doubt it is a code
PS4Deals,3d9rx1,iUsedtoHadHerpes,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:21:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I thought (about Gamefly) but just wanted to be sure"
PS4Deals,3d9rx1,MotleyKnight,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:12:14 2015 UTC,That would be really weird... Can anyone confirm?
PS4Deals,3d9rx1,MotleyKnight,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:19:37 2015 UTC,Nope it's the full game. You just have to download the update to get every single content.   Edit: and yes I forgot to mention it comes with a normal physical copy of the game
PS4Deals,3d9rx1,Gcoks,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:20:21 2015 UTC,Huge sale on some solid titles!
PS4Deals,3d9rx1,Gcoks,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:43:28 2015 UTC,Anybody played Madden 25? Can you play as a current team and do franchise mode?
PS4Deals,3d9rx1,javiayer,2,Tue Jul 14 17:01:22 2015 UTC,Yeah you can although you probably can find Madden 15 for $20 somewhere.
PS4Deals,3d9rx1,paulmgm,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:02:30 2015 UTC,I got an unopened copy 6 months ago for $30 on ebay. It should be easy to find one cheaper by now.
PS4Deals,3d9rx1,El_Poltergeisto,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:54:43 2015 UTC,Anyone know how long the sale is lasting? Might wait to do some price comparison.
PS4Deals,3d9rx1,knowWhereToRun,3,Tue Jul 14 17:53:29 2015 UTC,"Usually only last a day or two, stock disappears in no time. I bet most of these games will be gone by tonight. Sometimes they repost games the next day."
PS4Deals,3d9rx1,buttfaceninja,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:54:37 2015 UTC,You're probably right. I jumped on that Dying Light deal.
PS4Deals,3d9rx1,ChicagoZephyrs,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:25:45 2015 UTC,Sweet! Oh....you have to have an account. I'll wait.
PS4Deals,3d9rx1,girlcockboycockEIEIO,7,Tue Jul 14 18:09:30 2015 UTC,Yeah but you do not have to have a subscription. You just got to have an account.
PS4Deals,3d9rx1,coltsmetsfan614,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:11:17 2015 UTC,"Appreciate it. I made one but it started a 30 day trial. Now I have to figure out how to cancel lol  Edit: if any mobile users are trying this, you have to go to the full site in order to cancel."
PS4Deals,3d9uay,pedroIa,5,Tue Jul 14 16:59:15 2015 UTC,$15.99 if you have GCU.
PS4Deals,3d9uay,Golden_Taint,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:22:07 2015 UTC,I'm guessing US only?
PS4Deals,3d9uay,snooshie,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:34:54 2015 UTC,Also on sale for $19.99 on Amazon.com
PS4Deals,3d9uay,babaoreilymike,2,Tue Jul 14 20:16:28 2015 UTC,Yeah but I don't have prime
PS4Deals,3d9uay,ps4more,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:59:12 2015 UTC,looks like its 29.99 now
PS4Deals,3d7wby,DreadMcLaren,9,Tue Jul 14 05:09:51 2015 UTC,"Wow that's cheap, thanks for the heads up!"
PS4Deals,3d7wby,Nomad27,9,Tue Jul 14 05:33:15 2015 UTC,Game gets repetitive but for 11 dollars Id say its a steal
PS4Deals,3d7wby,BossAtlas,3,Tue Jul 14 11:44:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was pretty unfortunate about this game. I was pretty psyched for it, but it ended up being kinda mindless after a few hours.  I'd say definitely worth the $15 though."
PS4Deals,3d7wby,arcarsination,4,Tue Jul 14 15:10:51 2015 UTC,"Good deal there, Dragon Age is also on sale"
PS4Deals,3d7wby,spidey555,2,Tue Jul 14 11:12:12 2015 UTC,Nice. Thanks. In for one!
PS4Deals,3d7wby,Fatty_Boombalattie,2,Tue Jul 14 06:10:40 2015 UTC,Deal is dead
PS4Deals,3d7wby,I_Reggie,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:19:33 2015 UTC,Great deal on a very fun game
PS4Deals,3d7wby,WeaKeNx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:50:24 2015 UTC,Recommendations between the two?
PS4Deals,3d7wby,NOAHA202,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:06:28 2015 UTC,Which two?
PS4Deals,3d7wby,paulmgm,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:47:39 2015 UTC,"Oh right, sorry - Mordor and Inquisition"
PS4Deals,3d7wby,NOAHA202,3,Tue Jul 14 14:01:19 2015 UTC,"If you want a traditional RPG, go Inquisition.  If you want an action game with some RPG elements, go Mordor.   I have not played Inquisition, but I had a lot of fun with Mordor. As others have said, it gets repetitive though; once I finished the main story and unlockables, I didn't go back to it. Well worth the $15 price tag though.  Edit: Spelling"
PS4Deals,3d7wby,imn0tsarcastic,2,Tue Jul 14 15:25:47 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind micromanaging a party of 4, then DA. Mordor is basically assassins creed meets batman. If you enjoyed those two games I can't see why you wouldn't enjoy Mordor but DA has amazing graphics and the gameplay is pretty good too. I enjoyed both about the same but if I had to choose one I'd go with DA."
PS4Deals,3d7wby,paulmgm,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:12:44 2015 UTC,Thanks for the heads up. I wish there was a decent deal on the game of the year edition.
PS4Deals,3d7wby,edhere,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:29:16 2015 UTC,"It'll be that price instore, right?"

PS4Deals,3d7wby,AnimalPowers,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:11:14 2015 UTC,These were on my to buy list.  Buying both now.  Thanks for the tip!

PS4Deals,3d7wby,subway28,0,Tue Jul 14 19:11:06 2015 UTC,great game! Best LOTR in my opinion
PS4Deals,3d7wby,JayceeThunder,-6,Tue Jul 14 16:14:45 2015 UTC,ITS ABOUT TIME (still won't buy).
PS4Deals,3d7wby,wagedomain,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:58:37 2015 UTC,Any reason why?
PS4Deals,3d9e9y,ps_lovv,5,Tue Jul 14 15:05:58 2015 UTC,Might want to check reviews first...
PS4Deals,3d9e9y,signofthenine,3,Wed Jul 15 00:29:02 2015 UTC,Did this game just get released?
PS4Deals,3d9e9y,goddammnick,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:31:15 2015 UTC,Yes. Yesterday I believe?
PS4Deals,3d9e9y,dano8801,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:31:34 2015 UTC,lol ouch.
PS4Deals,3d9e9y,goddammnick,3,Wed Jul 15 18:46:12 2015 UTC,"Games not worth $50, played it on EA access. The career mode is so bad. Can't customize anything anymore. The worst part is it's not a yearly release anymore. So, if you're a golfer and wanted a golf game to play - you're going to have to wait awhile. This game will drop down lower. Be patient."
PS4Deals,3d9e9y,plizark,2,Wed Jul 15 21:08:28 2015 UTC,"With the reviews being as poor as they have been, this will be going lower soon."
PS4Deals,3ddi6s,druthers25,28,Wed Jul 15 12:34:06 2015 UTC,The deal we've all been waiting for!
PS4Deals,3ddi6s,ForeverUnclean,12,Wed Jul 15 12:57:54 2015 UTC,This justifies Prime Day alone
PS4Deals,3ddi6s,WhatIs4chan,43,Wed Jul 15 15:06:02 2015 UTC,Are they giving you the $13.50?  Because even then I would hold out for an even $20 before accepting.
PS4Deals,3ddi6s,Blue_Ryder,11,Wed Jul 15 13:15:00 2015 UTC,Are you sure? Maybe its a next gen version of duck hunt.  Edit: jeez i was kidding. I would never condon anyone to buy this game.
PS4Deals,3ddi6s,dacotahd,19,Wed Jul 15 14:15:25 2015 UTC,"This Prime Day blowout is incredible! I can't decide whether to grab Duck Dynasty or the Monopoly collection! I was planning on waiting for Black Friday for these to go on sale, might have to just grab them both now!"
PS4Deals,3ddi6s,Cryogos,13,Wed Jul 15 13:41:39 2015 UTC,Personally I was blown away by their deal on Sports Champions 2.
PS4Deals,3ddi6s,Tezla55,16,Wed Jul 15 14:30:22 2015 UTC,Still about $14 too high.
PS4Deals,3ddi6s,iUsedtoHadHerpes,5,Wed Jul 15 13:27:41 2015 UTC,"After seeing all of the deals, I'm convinced that Amazon didn't realize that it's July, not April Fool day. I have to admit they got me! Jokes over, Amazon. Pack it up"

PS4Deals,3ddi6s,Vykim223,2,Wed Jul 15 16:09:59 2015 UTC,They would have to pay me 60 dollars to complete this game.
PS4Deals,3ddi6s,Mattg082,0,Thu Jul 16 20:17:23 2015 UTC,"If they are willing to accept my left over Chinese containers and other trash, it may be a good deal."
PS4Deals,3d6nzz,joaonobre,5,Mon Jul 13 23:04:13 2015 UTC,Thanks! Super fast purchase/delivery and they take PayPal which is even better

PS4Deals,3d6nzz,hardangelfan,8,Tue Jul 14 01:20:35 2015 UTC,Start over. It's worth it.
PS4Deals,3d6nzz,skulLXeon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:40:00 2015 UTC,"For the single player, definitely.  I don't remember much from the multiplayer (other than playing a lot of it), but having certain skill options already unlocked would be a nice perk."

PS4Deals,3d6ula,penguinseed,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:13:17 2015 UTC,"I think so. The voice chat works pretty well and feels more immersive than text chat. When you get within ear shot of other characters, you can speak to each other. There is also group and guild voice chat for talking to people further away. All in all, I like not having to see a text box getting spammed and cluttering up my screen real estate."

It just may need a broken in but it was free and I like the sound quality.  My head is huge too.  So glad to finally have a PS4, can't wait to play Bloodborne and The Show all day.  If anyone is considering picking one of these up with some games I'd highly recommend getting Gamers Club Unlocked, I got Bloodboorne, The Show 15 and The Order: 1886 for 67.80 after tax.  I did pay an extra 30$ for the 2 year membership but that practically payed for itself today."

PS4Deals,3d5zzn,michael62895,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:43:38 2015 UTC,With ps4 purchase. Can confirm I did it today but I think it's only good for this month
PS4Deals,3d5zg0,AdrunkGirlScout,3,Mon Jul 13 20:06:15 2015 UTC,"Anyone have this game? Friend has it and we played a few matches together figuring out brutalities, but how is online by yourself, gameplay wise and design wise? How does it compare to other games like Street Fighter, Injustice, Killer Instinct?"
PS4Deals,3d5zg0,JamesMighty,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:16:24 2015 UTC,Looks like Amazon has price matched it.
PS4Deals,3d2e4h,Dedale,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:46:02 2015 UTC,It's until 10am tomorrow. Enjoy!

PS4Deals,3d2e4h,ZerosevEx,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:27:25 2015 UTC,How is this game?
PS4Deals,3d2e4h,edhere,2,Mon Jul 13 04:18:32 2015 UTC,Just got it from GameFly for $15($16.04 total shipped). MP is quite fun and story is so far better then 3. Coop is a plus bonus as well.
PS4Deals,3d2e4h,NightRed_,2,Mon Jul 13 05:54:22 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love it. I love the sense of freedom of open world games. I got it last Tuesday and I haven't gotten too far with the main story line but, to me, it's totally worth it just for the hunting. (Honey badgers will mess you up.)  By the way, if people are waiting for the game to arrive they can start earning in-game money by playing Far Cry 4 Arcade Poker (free). I just earned the last reward of 200,000 rupees yesterday. If they're done with that they can move on to Far Cry 4 Arena Master and build up their stable of animals and mercenaries to send custom arena challenges to their friends.  Edit: clarified the second app's function."
PS4Deals,3d2e4h,xincasinooutx,2,Mon Jul 13 19:07:50 2015 UTC,Never seen those apps.  Thanks for the links
PS4Deals,3d2e4h,LauKungPow,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:18:44 2015 UTC,"I think I'm just not the right audience for this game. I like FPS. Not really big on open world games. And god damn does this game have a ton of content. If you don't have ADD already, this game will certainly give it to you. There's so many side quests and other shit going on, it just gets overwhelming after a bit.  It's a gorgeous game. Gunplay is tight. I didn't care for the gun sounds, however.  This was my first Far Cry since the original, and this series just isn't for me. Watch some gameplay videos and see if its right for you."
PS4Deals,3d0rzp,DreadMcLaren,7,Sun Jul 12 15:40:10 2015 UTC,Looks like I'm gonna buy my ps4 this week

PS4Deals,3d0rzp,kilroyishere89,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:22:29 2015 UTC,"Stupid question, but im guessing that those deals would only apply to members of Amazon Prime?"
PS4Deals,3d0rzp,invisibleman6755,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:29:29 2015 UTC,"Yes! But you can easily start the prime free trial and immediately afterwards go to your account settings and disable the option of Amazon continuing your prime membership after the trial ends, thus not charging you."
PS4Deals,3d0rzp,Burninspace,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:29:45 2015 UTC,That's proving disappointing thus far...looks like this coupon will be the ticket for me!
PS4Deals,3d0rzp,mindsignals,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:22:06 2015 UTC,"I'm really hoping prime day comes through lol, I'm holding off all purchases till July 15th, not so I can order off Amazon... So I can take it to best buy or Walmart and price match :D"
PS4Deals,3d0rzp,kingslayershand,2,Sun Jul 12 19:42:47 2015 UTC,Looks like I'm not the only one waiting to do that. My brother keeps telling me they won't price match amazon and I'm like they're not a third party seller that he keeps saying they are. Sure they have third party sellers but they're not ebay. They are a legit store that best buy should honor.
PS4Deals,3d0rzp,Sixoul,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:28:41 2015 UTC,"Best Buy does price match Amazon, as long as it's sold by Amazon direct. BUT they don't typically match special sale prices like the 15th, so it could be a roll of the dice depending on how much the employee helping you cares."
PS4Deals,3d0rzp,Golden_Taint,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:41:58 2015 UTC,Nothing better than that instant satisfaction of walking out of the store with a console instead of having to wait :)

PS4Deals,3d0rzp,MadBeard,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:19:11 2015 UTC,Does anyone know if this coupon can be applied retroactively to a prior purchase? I bought the Arkham Knight LE PS4 less than a month ago.
PS4Deals,3d0rzp,eleffdee,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:35:31 2015 UTC,It really depends on who you get at guest services. It's definitely worth a try. If you bought with a redcard they give you 60 days
PS4Deals,3d0rzp,Vivacious-Vixen,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:04:50 2015 UTC,"Hey,have you given this a try? I also bought my Arkham Knight Ps4 from Target and. Got mine last Saturday, id like to see if this works"
PS4Deals,3d0rzp,28days6hrs42min12sec,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:30:46 2015 UTC,I tried it on a whim and it worked! I also called them a few days ago and they told me only within 3 days but that it would be up to the store's discretion. I had to go to Target to buy stuff anyway and decided to visit customer service. I think I got lucky because the associate wasn't sure but did it anyway. The cartwheel coupon didn't work so he manually took the 10% off. And I bought mine 3 weeks ago! Good luck!

PS4Deals,3d090s,thekingswitness,3,Sun Jul 12 18:35:57 2015 UTC,Is this years edition any better than 14?
PS4Deals,3d090s,IamsurroundedbyNs,5,Sun Jul 12 17:58:45 2015 UTC,This year's game has all official gear which is pretty amazing. Everything the players wear from cleats to glove is authentic. Fielding and  hitting seems to be a little easier IMO
PS4Deals,3d090s,Cooptwentysix,-2,Mon Jul 13 11:55:07 2015 UTC,From what I read... yes.

PS4Deals,3cxrh5,Golden_Taint,6,Sat Jul 11 18:56:39 2015 UTC,is this game worth it if I will be playing with at most 1 other person? and if I can only play in limited amounts of time?
PS4Deals,3cxrh5,koths1,4,Sat Jul 11 19:41:28 2015 UTC,"Yep! This game is perfectly playable with any kind of group, or even alone!  Well, it takes a long time to get to level 50 and then to VR14. There's a lot, a lot, of things to do, so really that's up to you.    Overall, though, I've really enjoyed it. Some people said its nothing like Skyrim, but I'd have to disagree, a lot of the aspects are very similar to Skyrim and other single-player RPG's so it's really easy to get into. I'd say it's worth the $40."
PS4Deals,3cxrh5,MNGaming,3,Sat Jul 11 21:23:25 2015 UTC,"I would love to hear some thoughts on this game from some one who owns it?  Also, does the price cut to $40 dollars help to ease some of the current issues in the game?"
PS4Deals,3cxrh5,Anon4378,5,Sat Jul 11 21:14:09 2015 UTC,"Hey there! I bought the game a week ago and have been having a blast. There's so much to do, and compared to other MMO's I've played, the quests are more interesting and thought out. I think it's well worth the $40 price tag honestly."
PS4Deals,3cxrh5,MNGaming,2,Sat Jul 11 21:25:12 2015 UTC,I paid full price and I couldn't be happier.
PS4Deals,3cxrh5,KlokworkOj,2,Sun Jul 12 23:27:59 2015 UTC,It's totally viable to enjoy this game both solo or in small groups. I highly recommend it. It's a great game.
PS4Deals,3cxrh5,anduin2000,2,Sun Jul 12 00:45:29 2015 UTC,I just want to add in that if you did the ps4 game share trick. Both you and your friend can play together on one purchase.
PS4Deals,3cxrh5,darknature,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:27:26 2015 UTC,What is this wizardry?
PS4Deals,3cxrh5,THUMB5UP,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:01:24 2015 UTC,"Pls, share this knowledge with us pslord"
PS4Deals,3cxrh5,gestapov,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:41:12 2015 UTC,OK here is how I did it. If you are the one who purchased it through PSN. These are the steps.   Make yourself Primary PS4 on your friends (second PS4) The one you are playing on will have the primary set to your friends account. Log into the PS store on the PS4 that your primarized ( your friend's) on your account Download. Once downloading begins you can have your friend log into his account from the same PS4. Enjoy.   Anyone that is playing on the PS4 that is your primary PS4 will be able to play all your games. Since PS ESO does not require an ESO account to play  (Unlike the other MMOs) You and your friend (or SO) can play together.   This trick works for every game you have downloaded through the PS store.   This trick also works for other games you own through the PSN store.  Edit. I do believe cash shops still works. I haven't tested that out yet.
PS4Deals,3cxrh5,darknature,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:17:58 2015 UTC,I wonder if the Imperial edition will go on sale too  Edit: nevermind it's sold out

PS4Deals,3cwvpm,platocplx,5,Sat Jul 11 14:04:17 2015 UTC,Best way to do this deal is to go to Bestbuy and get them to also pricematch amazon for the DS4 and get the charging station.  The Charging Station is this one: Charging Station  Deal is good through today

PS4Deals,3cwvpm,iPadAir64,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:00:25 2015 UTC,If you really want a charging station then this is probably a good deal.  I personally couldn't care less about having a charging station so I'm gonna hold out for the Prime Sale.

PS4Deals,3cxq1w,JDRoc,-3,Tue Jul 14 12:00:25 2015 UTC,Pure hope/speculation. But I'd put money on it. It's a hot new(ish) release. Expect a good 20 bucks knocked off retail. This is going to be a HUGE sale.

PS4Deals,3cud7p,Blueangel44,15,Fri Jul 10 21:43:11 2015 UTC,There is a new bundle coming out and you should definitely go for that. The original game will end up being just as cheap as this deal plus you get the other two expansions.

PS4Deals,3ctgak,ThePare,2,Fri Jul 10 17:12:59 2015 UTC,How is this game? thinking of picking it up once I finish Arkham Knight next week. Looks like fun
PS4Deals,3ctgak,DannyS333,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:13:47 2015 UTC,"I bought it for $40 way back and thought it was a great game for that price. $10 is a steal, it's a really fun game, easy platinum and looks gorgeous."
PS4Deals,3ctgak,Bradleyy13,2,Sat Jul 18 14:43:42 2015 UTC,"I was able to price match it at Best Buy adding another 10% off, came out to 9.71$ w/ tx."
PS4Deals,3ctgak,StrongBladder,2,Fri Jul 10 17:13:29 2015 UTC,"Same thing, thanks for the tip!"
PS4Deals,3ctgak,PSMOkizzle,-4,Wed Jul 15 04:21:50 2015 UTC,I'm guessing this is a Canadian best buy...
PS4Deals,3ctgak,ProfessorLube,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:57:21 2015 UTC,Of course
PS4Deals,3ctgak,xXsavagewulfXx,2,Fri Jul 10 19:22:12 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed this game. If any of my Canadian PS4 bros are looking for a fun campaign game, this is a great price for a fun game."
PS4Deals,3cpta2,DreadMcLaren,8,Thu Jul 9 20:21:35 2015 UTC,What a price! Anyone still on the fence? I will give you a nudge! Go get this masterpiece! Best game this gen for sure.
PS4Deals,3cpta2,jaredstorm,3,Fri Jul 10 03:40:25 2015 UTC,This game is worth full asking price.  Any sale is automatic win.
PS4Deals,3cpta2,x504xBEASTx,2,Fri Jul 10 18:06:08 2015 UTC,Okay I'm gonna pull the trigger on GCU
PS4Deals,3cpta2,Blueangel44,3,Thu Jul 9 23:22:54 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking about getting GCU for a while now. I just did the math and if I buy 3 new games I'll have saved enough money to make up for it. I wonder if you can still get the 20% off if you price match the new games?  Just looked it up, nope.   Can the 20% discount be combined with a competitor price match?  No, you would receive either the price match or the 20% discount, whichever is the lowest price. You would not be able to get both."
PS4Deals,3cpta2,astanix,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:32:51 2015 UTC,You can however use it with the coupons they email you. I get a $5 off coupon from Best Buy once every month or so. They stack & don't expire for around 3-4 months. Technically you can get 20% off (-$12) plus use a coupon or two & get another $5 to $10 off a brand new title. It's far cheaper than any price match I've found on newly released software.
PS4Deals,3cpta2,Mallion1,2,Fri Jul 10 14:06:06 2015 UTC,Well I've decided I'm going to do this. I'm going up to Best Buy tonight to enroll in the GCU program and buy Lego Jurassic World for my son.
PS4Deals,3cpta2,astanix,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:23:33 2015 UTC,"As a fellow Dad, it's a no-brainer. My son and I both game so I use the discount a lot. Plus the 20% off stacks with all sale prices including all holiday and Black Friday deals. Makes Christmas shopping easy. :)"
PS4Deals,3cpta2,Golden_Taint,4,Mon Jul 13 09:47:52 2015 UTC,It is well worth the price.
PS4Deals,3cpta2,dsizzle2-0,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:11:36 2015 UTC,Add the game to your cart to reflect the price.
PS4Deals,3cpta2,IronGoht,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:05:09 2015 UTC,Is this online only?
PS4Deals,3cpta2,IronGoht,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:42:39 2015 UTC,"No, you can go to the store and get it too.  I'd say it would be easier just to order it online for in-store pickup and get it that way."
PS4Deals,3cpta2,ishkabibbel2000,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:44:15 2015 UTC,I've got a couple games to trade in so I'll just pick it up in store. Thanks dewd
PS4Deals,3cqa2r,huzaifas2000,20,Thu Jul 9 22:26:39 2015 UTC,Eh.
PS4Deals,3cqa2r,SuckmyCrockPot,4,Fri Jul 10 00:53:37 2015 UTC,"Not to stir up controversy but I actually enjoyed this game start to finish and I felt my money was well spent on launch day, Hate me if you will but it is also my favorite ubisoft game in a while, also liked Valiant Hearts and Child of Light, But all in all I loved it just online is unfair it keeps all car stats the same so pay for upgrades and there's no chance"
PS4Deals,3cqa2r,Aop_or3o,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:12:55 2015 UTC,I share the same sentiment although I only got as far as playing the beta and the demo. The sheer thrill of exploring that map satisfies my lust for exploration. $20 dollars seems fair to me.
PS4Deals,3cqa2r,ayneezy,2,Fri Jul 10 14:15:33 2015 UTC,"I didn't play the Demo or Beta I hoped in because me and my friend wanted to play together and it was fun but after level 3 we started playing at our own pace and seeing other people on the map can be fun as well just burning tires or honking at eachother, I feel like it fed my open world car game itch until Need for Speed comes out"
PS4Deals,3cqa2r,Aop_or3o,8,Fri Jul 10 19:39:56 2015 UTC,This game is dropping in price a lot faster than Driveclub!  Go Driveclub!
PS4Deals,3cqa2r,hardangelfan,3,Fri Jul 10 02:07:59 2015 UTC,"Decent deal, but this game looks and plays like crap. Get DriveClub, ProjectCARS or NFS Rivals first."
PS4Deals,3cqa2r,DreadMcLaren,-3,Fri Jul 10 02:10:10 2015 UTC,I don't know. Drive Club had horrendous car control.
PS4Deals,3cqa2r,youdismantleme,7,Fri Jul 10 12:07:05 2015 UTC,"I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels this way. I wouldn't say horrendous, but it just feels off to me, and I can't get into it."
PS4Deals,3cqa2r,RustledHard,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:07:21 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree. I'm a huge fan of Forza and compared to that (and Gran Torismo to some extent) the driving feels off to me as well. It's really hard to describe. The cars' turning radius is so little compared to the traction they get when they turn, it's like every directional input that should be precise isn't, and every input that shouldn't be, is. All the cars feel sort of weightless and like they're remote controlled cars."
PS4Deals,3cqa2r,qwerty-snowman,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:16:02 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I found myself fighting the ""physics"" more than the track when getting platinum."
PS4Deals,3cqa2r,Sandite5,-2,Sun Jul 12 08:20:48 2015 UTC,No it doesn't.  You just have to learn to drive better.
PS4Deals,3cqa2r,6stringSammy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:59:17 2015 UTC,Games like forza and project cars have handling on point. Driveclub just doesn't I mean the game acts like you're constantly on wet roads/snow.
PS4Deals,3cqa2r,Send_Headlight_Fluid,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:48:12 2015 UTC,I don't understand. I click the deal and it just brings me to the PC version. How exactly do I buy the PS4 version?
PS4Deals,3cqa2r,Max_Character_Limit-,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:31:49 2015 UTC,Click the PS4 version and you can get it for the price that the OP posted.
PS4Deals,3cqa2r,DreadMcLaren,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:09:42 2015 UTC,"That's odd, the deal must have ended. PS4 version is displayed for $50.  http://gyazo.com/ce42be099b359254ff2fc4932698d4cd"

PS4Deals,3cqa2r,chrisology,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:41:28 2015 UTC,How is the game guys?
PS4Deals,3cqa2r,CannabinoidAndroid,0,Sat Jul 11 02:43:35 2015 UTC,Is this game more hyper-realism like Project CARS or is it a more casual break-gas-drift faire?
PS4Deals,3cqa2r,DudeGuy123,6,Fri Jul 10 01:14:27 2015 UTC,This game is crap. Story and controls are not good.
PS4Deals,3cqa2r,CannabinoidAndroid,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:38:03 2015 UTC,ok. . .  Can you specify what it is you don't like about the controls?  I'm not looking for an amazing driving game. But the condensed United States world map looks interesting.
PS4Deals,3cqa2r,atomicpunk5150,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:41:35 2015 UTC,"The size of the map and how you can arial zoom to a location is quite cool. But even after messing with the vehicle settings multiple times, the driving mechanics are like your front tires are on ice and just feels really disconnected. I tried and tried and tried some more to like this game but I finally had to give up on it."
PS4Deals,3cqa2r,DudeGuy123,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:48:56 2015 UTC,Play the demo and you will see
PS4Deals,3cqa2r,bburchibanez,-2,Fri Jul 10 01:50:57 2015 UTC,Exactly. Played the demo and this game is pure crap. I might pick it up if it hits $5 on PSN
PS4Deals,3cqa2r,ColinZealSE,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:21:13 2015 UTC,"Controls?  Steerings controls, put steering dead zone down to 0, and crank up steering sensitivity to 75% + Hardcore steering (or whatever it was called) - After that the game gets fantastic steering. No sluggishness or unresponsiveness."
PS4Deals,3cqa2r,progz,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:51:01 2015 UTC,cmon now... we all know thats make it only a little better... its not a complete fix. the controls still suck even doing that.
PS4Deals,3cqa2r,ColinZealSE,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:18:51 2015 UTC,its not a complete fix. the controls still suck even doing that.   It's an arcady driving game. The controls are just fine after the fix.
PS4Deals,3cqa2r,IzeBerg,2,Sat Jul 11 17:24:40 2015 UTC,"to actually answer the question...it is a casual game. but like /u/DudeGuy123 said, it is some dookie"
PS4Deals,3cqa2r,CannabinoidAndroid,2,Fri Jul 10 01:40:54 2015 UTC,That's unfortunate. I was kind of hoping for a larger version of Burnout Paradise.
PS4Deals,3cqa2r,IzeBerg,2,Fri Jul 10 01:48:07 2015 UTC,Aren't we all...Burnout was amazing!
PS4Deals,3cqa2r,AdrunkGirlScout,2,Fri Jul 10 01:50:29 2015 UTC,"Burnout is why I still instinctively rear end every car I see in a driving game, I can't play realistic ones anymore lmao. Same way Blitz is why I can't play Madden"

PS4Deals,3clojf,Burninspace,16,Wed Jul 8 21:46:41 2015 UTC,"So honestly I'm expecting a ton of really good ps4 deals from Amazon next week so if I were you I'd just wait. No promises, but with their claim of a bigger sale than black Friday, I'd expect some big tech deals."
PS4Deals,3clojf,polarbearbuddy,3,Wed Jul 8 22:16:13 2015 UTC,Surely those deals are going to be for Prime members only?
PS4Deals,3clojf,laccro,9,Wed Jul 8 23:41:55 2015 UTC,"Correct. But there's also a 30 day trial you can get for free just for this sale, then cancel it afterwards. Amazon confirms this on their site."
PS4Deals,3clojf,ScalaZen,2,Wed Jul 8 23:54:22 2015 UTC,Yep this. The new version of PS4 is coming out. (No performance changes)
PS4Deals,3clojf,skankingrove,2,Wed Jul 8 23:57:58 2015 UTC,Thanks for this comment! I've been watching this sub a bit here and there waiting for a good deal to push me over the edge to maybe getting a ps4. I had no idea a newer model would be coming out so thanks to you I can stay keeping an eye out for it. Hopefully with this amazon sale we'll see some good deals.
PS4Deals,3clojf,ScalaZen,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:15:12 2015 UTC,You're welcome! Sony officially announced it last month
PS4Deals,3clojf,Newman4185,2,Thu Jul 9 14:49:52 2015 UTC,Hugely speculative 1TB HDD

PS4Deals,3clojf,RaffNav,-1,Thu Jul 9 04:45:51 2015 UTC,It seems to only be for people who haven't had a prime trial before. Or maybe I just used my first free trial too recently (5 months ago)
PS4Deals,3clojf,thatoneguy120486,2,Thu Jul 9 05:05:16 2015 UTC,If you use gmail you can put a period in your email and it will get routed correctly. This allowing you to sign up for another free trial. Ex email is redditor@gmail.com the email reddit.or@gmail.com will still go to the first email. But will be a distinct email as far as Amazon is concerned.
PS4Deals,3clojf,laccro,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:09:58 2015 UTC,"I doubt they'd give you another trial if you've already had one! But honestly prime is fairly worth it, at least in my opinion. But I get half off for being a student; if you have a .edu email address, you can tell them you're a student (whether you actually are or not, I won't tell), and they'll give you half off prime"
PS4Deals,3clojf,KyuubiReddit,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:39:28 2015 UTC,I thought they (sometimes) ask you to send proof?
PS4Deals,3clojf,gryffindorlove,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:29:36 2015 UTC,yeah you have to confirm it via an email link they send you to the .edu address you provided
PS4Deals,3clojf,KyuubiReddit,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:11:40 2015 UTC,and that's it?  they don't ask details about your studies? or need any other proof (documentation or something) ?

PS4Deals,3cju7a,randyfudgedholden,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:52:20 2015 UTC,We had the same coupon in Germany a while back. Used it to get a year's worth of PS Plus for only 40€. Definitely recommended!
PS4Deals,3cijwm,WillHS,6,Wed Jul 8 04:36:35 2015 UTC,Just bought it myself. Total came out to be $19.47 with tax and free shipping.
PS4Deals,3cijwm,penguinseed,3,Wed Jul 8 04:46:23 2015 UTC,Is this a game you can enjoy without being familiar with the first Dragon Age games?
PS4Deals,3cijwm,Goat_Slaya,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:14:31 2015 UTC,I just finished it without playing the other games and really enjoyed it. So I would say yes.

PS4Deals,3cijwm,Sekular,2,Wed Jul 8 12:34:00 2015 UTC,"Grabbed one. I was holding out for possibly a game of the year type edition, but for less than 20 bucks I couldn't wait. I love Gamefly too by the way, just haven't played much console until getting a ps4 a couple of weeks ago. I'd recommend their service."

PS4Deals,3cijwm,Mystic11,2,Thu Jul 9 00:48:29 2015 UTC,Just picked one up. Has anyone ordered from gamefly before? Any chance of a used copy being horribly scratched?
PS4Deals,3cijwm,buket0chicken,2,Thu Jul 9 02:54:51 2015 UTC,No chance at all. I've had gamefly for about 5 years now and never had an issue with purchasing games through them.

PS4Deals,3cic7g,LauKungPow,10,Wed Jul 8 03:23:14 2015 UTC,If all you do is pick this game up and play it with friends when they come over you will totally get your monies worth.  I own it and only play it when buddies come over.  Winner stays on and loser passes the controller to the next person.  No one really understands the ground game so all the fights just turn into amazingly fun stand up wars.  We've had so many awesome and hilarious KO moments and no one ever wins more than 3 in a row.  So fun.
PS4Deals,3cic7g,WZeddemore84,3,Wed Jul 8 15:02:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the ground stuff is really complicated but the stand up brawls are pretty easy to get into.  Definitely a blast with a bunch of people over."
PS4Deals,3cic7g,OneLuckyContestant,4,Wed Jul 8 17:07:44 2015 UTC,This is the cheapest I've seen this game at. So what's the general consensus? Get it yay or nay?
PS4Deals,3cic7g,x504xBEASTx,3,Wed Jul 8 11:37:16 2015 UTC,For $10...It's a definite yes.
PS4Deals,3cic7g,x504xBEASTx,2,Fri Jul 10 18:08:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah I bought it 10 minutes after I made that comment. Had the time of my life with a couple friends soon after, especially since the game glitched out and started t-posing"
PS4Deals,3cic7g,_misterwilly,2,Fri Jul 10 18:45:35 2015 UTC,Hahahaha dude that happened to me last year. I was McGregor vs Aldo. I grabbed for the clinch and it instantly did that.  Lasted all round but fixed itself when the round was over.

PS4Deals,3cic7g,OriginalUneeK,2,Wed Jul 8 20:53:58 2015 UTC,Bought it for 60 and thought it was worth it. 10 is a steal

PS4Deals,3cic7g,giofio89,2,Thu Jul 9 16:30:39 2015 UTC,"EA Sports UFC - Review: https://youtu.be/ynsNrySbOHU   I think for the price its beyond worth it. The patches fixed some of the issues discussed in the video. Jump on it, especially if you have a brother or a few friends over, it's a blast.   Also if your not to sure you'll enjoy it, injustice gods among us is on sale for the exact same price. That's another great fighting game that takes a little less finesse than UFC. Also fun with family or friends."
PS4Deals,3cic7g,stemcg1983,2,Thu Jul 9 17:10:39 2015 UTC,"I've been playing it for the past couple of days and it's a blast to have friends to play with and just absolutely destroy each other with stand wars. Ground game's pretty difficult to get into, but the fights are so fuckin' hype and exciting. Career mode is difficult as balls to get into, legit play Beginner to even advance through it. Definitely worth 10 bucks in my opinion."

PS4Deals,3chr2x,Rikarour,6,Wed Jul 8 00:25:38 2015 UTC,Game is too short and the way the characters look kinda sucks. Good game to have some quick fun
PS4Deals,3chr2x,rodblt2221,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:23:02 2015 UTC,Really? I probably pick up injustice then... I knew the game was bad but maybe I'll wait for a better deal
PS4Deals,3chr2x,rodblt2221,3,Wed Jul 8 04:06:29 2015 UTC,"Also, the gold edition which comes with 6 extra costumes, is $23.40 for ps+ members on the ps store"
PS4Deals,3chr2x,rodblt2221,-1,Wed Jul 8 04:13:47 2015 UTC,Oh really? Hmm I still prefer physical version but I'll think about it
PS4Deals,3chr2x,rodblt2221,2,Wed Jul 8 04:25:25 2015 UTC,"It would honestly come out about the same, the costumes add-on is like $6 so if you like physical copies, it would come out as $28, just $4 more.  Edit: getting the costumes with the gold edition as add-ons is actually $8 so it would come out to $30. Depends on if you're okay to spend $8 more for a physical copy"
PS4Deals,3chr2x,edhere,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:33:04 2015 UTC,thanks for the math but ill probably buy it when its cheaper or have a ten dollar coupon haha
PS4Deals,3cgwa8,DreadMcLaren,5,Tue Jul 7 20:35:26 2015 UTC,Hopefully Amazon Prime Day will have a good deal on ps4's.

PS4Deals,3cgwa8,Discord_Show,3,Sun Jul 19 19:29:05 2015 UTC,Does anyone know if Best Buy will price match this? I have some gift cards I need to use with them.
PS4Deals,3cgwa8,gavinc42,2,Tue Jul 7 22:12:18 2015 UTC,"I was told if it's a reputable site, they will(I'm sure Newegg is)."
PS4Deals,3cgwa8,ElectricBlitz,2,Wed Jul 8 07:06:49 2015 UTC,I don't think BB will pricematch this since it requires a coupon code. Their policy says it excludes coupon offers.
PS4Deals,3cgwa8,dude333,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:49:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I was wondering about. It's technically not a coupon. It's a promo code. But I can see how they would consider it the same thing."
PS4Deals,3cgwa8,gavinc42,2,Wed Jul 8 17:22:58 2015 UTC,"I am going to give it a try today, I'll let you know how it goes, they actually did something similar for me when I was buying my dad a computer. They price matched something and then they let me use an additional best buy coupon, they just needed managers approval, it's kind of different but maybe with a cool manager it would be possible"
PS4Deals,3cgwa8,kingslayershand,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:56:56 2015 UTC,Fantastic. Looking forward to hearing how it went. Thanks!

PS4Deals,3cgwa8,Blueangel44,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:32:18 2015 UTC,no tax?
PS4Deals,3cgwa8,kingslayershand,2,Wed Jul 8 04:43:04 2015 UTC,"From Newgg's FAQ: ""Within the United States, Newegg.com charges sales tax on orders shipping to California, Indiana, New Jersey and Tennessee only."" http://kb.newegg.com/FAQ/Article/1360  I'm in a state that normally charges sales tax but is not on the above list, so buying from Newegg cuts my price down about $40 less than anywhere else. SOLD!  $355 at checkout :D ($6 for shipping)"
PS4Deals,3cgwa8,Ludosys,3,Wed Jul 8 14:46:35 2015 UTC,"Yea without Tax $355, is an awesome price! I might just pull the trigger, and buy it with tax, it's would still be a good deal."

PS4Deals,3cgwa8,iHad12many,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:16:00 2015 UTC,"To answer a couple of questions:   Best buy will price match the item as long as it's shipped and sold by new egg themselves. So you should not have a problem with a price match.  It really depends on you. Personally I would just purchase it now. The new version will come out yes. However, the 1TB will only be released in the UK on July 15th. As to when it will have a US release is still uncertain. I'm guessing closer to September or around the holidays. Than if anything the price of the 500GB will drop. However, if you can wait than go with the new model.    Currently this is a pretty good deal. Keep in mind you can also easily swap out the 500GB for a larger storage unit."
PS4Deals,3cgwa8,dthunterx,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:56:07 2015 UTC,How much more would the new model cost though? That's the main issue.
PS4Deals,3cgwa8,Marashio,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:18:19 2015 UTC,I'm willing to bet it will be $399.99 + tax and the current model will drop to $349.99. You can find a 1TB internal hard drive for $50 or less. Or spend a little more and get a 2TB one and it will cost about the same as the new model would after tax.
PS4Deals,3cgwa8,dthunterx,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:31:13 2015 UTC,"Indeed that is the only problem. I did hear a rumour that it will rival the Xbox one 1TB which I believe will be priced at $400. So it's possible the ps4 1TB will also be at$400. Therefore knocking it down to $350. To be honest at least for the 500GB, $350 will probably be the lowest it will go unless there is some kind of sudden flash sale or the profits drop. Everything is strong right now so. It's a good price"
PS4Deals,3cgwa8,Burninspace,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:35:00 2015 UTC,Does anybody know for how long the promo code will be valid?
PS4Deals,3cgwa8,kingslayershand,2,Wed Jul 8 20:58:49 2015 UTC,I believe till July 13th
PS4Deals,3cgwa8,Basic85,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:44:46 2015 UTC,There is tax and shipping.  I was surprised about the shipping part but oh well.  Will wait on the newer version coming out July 15 in Europe though and see how that goes if there are any price drops.

Edit: I ordered online for a store pick up. Manager was nice enough to cancel my online order and re-scan it for $15.99.

PS4Deals,3cgw2c,remeard,6,Tue Jul 7 22:11:39 2015 UTC,I bought one recently and I gotta say they hurt my ears a lot. The sounds great but my headband is already cracking. Maybe I got a bad one but I wouldn't recommend this headset
PS4Deals,3cgw2c,Girvil,4,Tue Jul 7 23:43:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's not worth $20. Ears get sweaty and they hurt after an hour of play, mic is utter crap, but the sound is alright. I would just save those $20 and use it towards the Gold headset. It's $55 at Walmart.com!"
PS4Deals,3cgw2c,Its11thPlanet,2,Wed Jul 8 01:18:32 2015 UTC,"Any major difference in the build quality, to my understanding the only difference was that it was wireless to wired."
PS4Deals,3cgw2c,remeard,6,Wed Jul 8 01:32:25 2015 UTC,"The Golds are a bit better in build, but mainly on the ears, which are cups as opposed to Silver's on the ears. They do hurt your ears after a bit of playing, bit the mic is fine. Gold is better, but I got my Silvers for $30 and I'm not complaining. However, I'm frugal."
PS4Deals,3cgw2c,CheetoX23,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:40:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I've only recently started playing with the headset for all game and chat audio as to not disturb my wife and roommate.  I'm extremely cheap, but I just got paid and thought I might treat myself."
PS4Deals,3cgw2c,remeard,3,Wed Jul 8 01:43:43 2015 UTC,"If you can splurge, it wouldn't be terrible to get the Gold, but really beyond the the ear hurting thing, I have no issue with my Silvers. I can adjust them so it doesn't hurt, I don't know why anyone's ears would sweat, and never had a problem with the mic. Wired is an issue for some people, but the cord is long enough for me to sit comfortably across the room. The sound is pretty good as well."
PS4Deals,3cgw2c,CheetoX23,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:02:38 2015 UTC,I can adjust them so it doesn't hurt   How do you adjust them? I try to move them around a bit when they start to feel tight but they get uncomfortable again soon after.

PS4Deals,3cf1ej,snaper,2,Tue Jul 7 12:11:15 2015 UTC,I've heard this game was broken on release. How is it now compared to before?
PS4Deals,3cf1ej,schpooples,2,Tue Jul 7 17:13:28 2015 UTC,"I bought the game 2 weeks ago when it was $18 on amazon.  I started the game before the update file installed, and it was literally 5 minutes before it froze my ps4 and I had to unplug.  Since it installed the update file, no problems other than a little frame-rate lag, pop-ins, and just small insignificant bugs that have no real effect on gameplay.  I don't suggest paying full-price for the game, but the gameplay is severely enhanced over previous AC games, and for $20, I think it's a steal."
PS4Deals,3cf1ej,the_toaster_lied,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:39:13 2015 UTC,I'm curious too. I was actually looking for Black Flag when I found this.

PS4Deals,3cf1ej,bort_sampson,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:17:23 2015 UTC,"Played the whole game through.

Worth getting for $20."

PS4Deals,3cf1ej,the_toaster_lied,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:16:42 2015 UTC,"Totally worth it.  I bought it a couple of weeks ago when it went down to $18 on Amazon.  It's beautiful, huge, and so much fun."

PS4Deals,3cf1ej,the_toaster_lied,2,Tue Jul 7 20:15:15 2015 UTC,"It sometimes drops on cut scenes and when you're running around with a lot of NPCs rendered, but it's not something that really bothers me.  There are some pop-in issues as well, but again, for the $18 I spent on it, that doesn't bother me.  I wouldn't have paid full-price for it, but I highly suggest it for such a discount.  And honestly, you'll probably be able to buy it, beat it in a week, and return it to gamestop for a few dollars of profit."

As a bonus, after you pull the 2TB hdd from the enclosure you can put the 500GB from the ps4 into it and use it as an external drive still. Edit - I purchased it new on amazon for $79.99."

PS4Deals,3cbeps,onlyinstores52,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:44:24 2015 UTC,"it was much more tedious on the PS3, at least on the PS4 it's all automated :)"
PS4Deals,3cbeps,KyuubiReddit,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:54:40 2015 UTC,"It's as automatic on the PS3 as on the PS4. Just click on download on all games, then  shut down the system. The PS3 asks if you wan't it to download everything first and then install them before shutting down.  You just answer YES and you're good to go."
PS4Deals,3cbeps,ColinZealSE,2,Wed Jul 8 15:35:19 2015 UTC,"Wow all this time I've been doing it wrong. Mine only downloaded the install files. I still had to open each file and wait forever for each single game to install.   Thanks, I'll try it your way."
PS4Deals,3cbeps,KyuubiReddit,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:38:44 2015 UTC,"Oh man, feel so sorry for you. :) Sometime in the middle of the PS3 lifetime the machine got a firmware update that gave us this feature. So wonderful.   Even if you have 100 downloaded files ready to install, just download a demo and shut down the machine during the download. It'll ask if you want it to install the demo after the download - and proceeds to install the rest."
PS4Deals,3cbeps,ColinZealSE,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:45:03 2015 UTC,"haha, don't worry, I didn't really use my PS3 for years, only started using it again recently, and with PS+ (that I have for like 4 months) and PSN sales, I already have quite a backlog of digital games, so much that I need to upgrade my 160GB into the 500GB that I took out my PS4.  thanks again, I hated doing it manually for each game :)  but I guess it won't download and install updates automatically for you if you never launched the game, will it?"

PS4Deals,3cbeps,Swoah,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:49:52 2015 UTC,wait how do you transfer PT to a new hard drive? I could only put the save data onto my flash drive and you can't redownload PT from the store.
PS4Deals,3cbeps,PubicTransportation,2,Tue Jul 7 10:59:48 2015 UTC,"So basically if you want to keep P.T., you do a system backup, its under the settings on the ps4 menu. After you have it backed up to thumb drive, you install your new hdd, then hold the power button for about 8 seconds and it boots into safe mode. From there you use the system restore option and restore it from the usb thumb drive, P.T. can be transfered that way, I don't know of another way."
PS4Deals,3cbeps,SuicideHotdog,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:13:47 2015 UTC,"Oh I see. Well, I already installed my new hard drive and all my games on it. What would happen if I were to put my old hard drive back in, back up only PT onto a flash drive, and restore that USB on my new hard drive? Would I lose all the games I've downloaded on my new hard drive?"
PS4Deals,3cbeps,PubicTransportation,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:06:45 2015 UTC,It will delete the new drive when you restore. I don't know if you can just put the old one back in without formating it tho.

PS4Deals,3c9ydf,xXsavagewulfXx,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:35:55 2015 UTC,"It is a really good game. I got it 2 weeks ago with my PS4, and really enjoyed it. Took me about 12 hours my first playthrough, and that was trying to 100% everything. Going through a second time now to platinum. I found the story and missions to be varied enough that it never felt tedious.   There is nothing ground breaking about Second Son (other than maybe the visuals), but it is a solid action-adventure game."
PS4Deals,3c9ydf,snaper,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:02:55 2015 UTC,I'm a few hours in and enjoying it. The controls are responsive and your special abilities are fun.  For $10 you're getting more than your moneys worth.  Install and update is 21.51GB.

PS4Deals,3c87vc,dthunterx,2,Sun Jul 5 20:36:59 2015 UTC,Think this is worth the buy or do you think I could find it even cheaper? I've been holding out for a while now.
PS4Deals,3c87vc,Marashio,4,Mon Jul 6 02:40:45 2015 UTC,"It's not a terrible deal. However, including tax, it prices it back over $400. It depends if you are interested in the game as well. If you are going to play and enjoy it than it's worth it.   The 1TB is to be released on July 15th, so it might be a price drop on the 500GB. So, if you are willing to wait a bit longer it could be worth it. If not than right now this isn't a bad deal. There have been better ones."
PS4Deals,3c87vc,zonda600,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:56:22 2015 UTC,I've been looking to find a reliable source for the NA release date of the new 500gb model and 1TB model. Where did you read July 15th?
PS4Deals,3c87vc,Marashio,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:09:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah it is definitely hard to find. It is because it's so popular there is no reason for Sony to drop the price.   Although I forgot the source I should be more clear and say that they 1TB will be released on the 15th in Europe. So, that's why the price may drop.  whether or not that will affect the North American version and when that will be released is a different story but just something to be noted"
PS4Deals,3c87vc,kingslayershand,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:31:03 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm not really too interested in the game. I'm mainly just looking to get a PS4 plus controller as cheap as possible and in good condition.

PS4Deals,3c4ias,Nadaf1nga,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:10:04 2015 UTC,Worth it at all? Game any good?
PS4Deals,3c4ias,Kirschke95,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:13:08 2015 UTC,"The game is decent, feels like a generic battlefield game thats re-skinned to be crooks and cops. The new game modes are pretty fun for a while (with friends maybe) but at the end of the dayit still feels like Battlefield 4 with a makeover. This is only my opinion, to each their own. If you like shooters and all you have is COD: AW then this would be a decent side purchase to the fast pace of an exo suit. Hope I helped a little."
PS4Deals,3c0g5r,ScalaZen,3,Fri Jul 3 17:16:10 2015 UTC,"It takes a little while for things to get going in the game, but once you get the hang of things and level up a bit it's a blast. I haven't put any time into any other game since I bought ESO. And other users are correct, there is no required subscription. There is an optional $15 a month which allots you 1500 crowns a month, and access to DLC, but it's not a necessity by any means"
PS4Deals,3c0g5r,DefCone1,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:52:50 2015 UTC,Nailed it. Exactly this.
PS4Deals,3c0g5r,diskx,4,Sat Jul 4 03:22:26 2015 UTC,"I really want to play this, I just don't know how it is to get into. I've tried watching playthroughs and streams but idk, plus i don't need another subscription. Is it worth it?"
PS4Deals,3c0g5r,UnbiasedOnionRing,9,Fri Jul 3 18:55:10 2015 UTC,It's my understanding it's not subscription anymore
PS4Deals,3c0g5r,diskx,3,Fri Jul 3 19:10:18 2015 UTC,"Really? I may look into it then. I'm all for games, but don't charge me 9.99 a month to play on top of the $60, but I get it."
PS4Deals,3c0g5r,UnbiasedOnionRing,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:12:00 2015 UTC,Yeah I am a big Elder Scrolls fan. I was quite excited when this game was announced but I just find it... A bit lackluster. However the PVP looks awesome and I will probably consider a purchase when the price drops -- especially since the subscription was dropped.
PS4Deals,3c0g5r,Kirschke95,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:31:39 2015 UTC,Yup no sub fee. Its great and really fun.
PS4Deals,3c0g5r,FlyingtheFox,2,Fri Jul 3 21:34:50 2015 UTC,On sale at best buy starting tomorrow 7/12 for 39.99. Gcu = ~$36
PS4Deals,3c0g5r,FlyingtheFox,3,Sun Jul 12 00:15:18 2015 UTC,"1) Don't judge this game based off reviews of the PC launch last year. The game was almost entirely redone on PC and Consoles and 80% of the problems were fixed.  2) THERE IS NO SUBSCRIPTION FEE TO PLAY. You can subscribe to a monthly ""crown store"" thing that gives you discounted funds to buy in game items like costumes, mounts, and crafting styles. Said subscription also includes all future DLC included - so it has value, but is not required.  3) You can play any race with any class in this game, nothing was limited with a pre-order. The pre-order allowed you to play any race in any faction, which only changes cosmetics and nothing more.  4) The PS4 version is surprisingly populated, but the game is very focused on guilds. You will need a guild to easily buy/sell/trade valuable items, and having a guild makes getting groups for dungeons/pvp much much easier.  However, if you want you can solo most of the game by yourself. You cannot solo dungeons though, and PVP is much harder alone (unless you make a character who is an in-n-out assassin type).  5) While the end game does get more stat focused, and groups will start to focus on specific character builds to best conquer a raid, the entire game still offers you unlimited freedom to design a character any way you want.  You can make a light armor wearing, archer assassin. Or a mage who wears heavy armor and lights everything on fire while taking a beating. Play however you want! When one build is not working, you can easily adjust and try something else :).  Sorry for the long post, but this is my favorite game of 2015.  80 hours in so far and only half way to max level.  If anyone buys it and needs friends to play with/ask questions - my PSN is LookOutFox."
PS4Deals,3c0g5r,FlyingtheFox,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:58:05 2015 UTC,Completely agree with this. Also I'll add you!

PS4Deals,3c0g5r,huggythejerk,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:52:53 2015 UTC,"I am curious about this game, but I heard about insane pre-order shit like you couldn't get all the races or classes and you couldn't change your skills or something if you didn't pre-order?  Is that true or still going on?"
PS4Deals,3c0g5r,defiledhero,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:30:54 2015 UTC,"Odd. Haven't heard of that. If anything must of been a launch bug, and quickly resolved.   I can assure I've made all the classes and races to try out"
PS4Deals,3c0g5r,RudyBagels,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:23:34 2015 UTC,"What you're thinking of is the preorder bonus that let you play as any race in any faction. I'm not sure if that's still a thing, but it was a bit controversial when it was announced it was happening on PC.  Either way, it doesn't actually affect you gameplay-wise."
PS4Deals,3c0g5r,huggythejerk,-2,Sat Jul 4 14:21:23 2015 UTC,"I imagine you're probably better off with FFXIV.. The game that has been a success, millions of subs, just had its first expansion release without a hiccup..  Compared to ESO.. Which has been largely considered a failure all around."
PS4Deals,3c0g5r,zellthemedic,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:38:44 2015 UTC,"FFXIV is awesome, but it has a sub fee, which would probably put people off. FFXIV's PvP is also pretty much... not good. ESO also has far superior leveling experience, while FFXIV has amazing fights and an amazing story. ESO has somewhat of a revitalization since it went b2p. I wouldn't say it's a huge failure anymore, it's a decent game to just play.   I bought ESO on PC but I never really got into it though. Currently playing Heavensward and it is great."
PS4Deals,3c0g5r,huggythejerk,-5,Sun Jul 5 05:52:04 2015 UTC,"My understanding from most reviews was that this game was pretty flawed in just about every way imaginable,  so if $60 spend with care.  One example: https://youtu.be/Ov3B26h12C4"
PS4Deals,3c0g5r,zellthemedic,7,Fri Jul 3 19:16:43 2015 UTC,The pc release was a huge failure
PS4Deals,3c0g5r,HitachinoBia,4,Fri Jul 3 19:51:33 2015 UTC,"That review is over a year old. I don't know if it's a good game or not but given the changes MMO's tend to make, I don't think that this review is a fair assessment of the current game."
PS4Deals,3c0g5r,censoredspeech,5,Fri Jul 3 19:20:56 2015 UTC,That fair but I think because of the original reviews it merits some research before a purchase.
PS4Deals,3c0s9y,Sincitysir1,3,Fri Jul 3 18:47:11 2015 UTC,If i had the extra money id buy Evolve for 14.99. seems like a fair price.
PS4Deals,3c0s9y,hamburgersandfries,7,Sat Jul 4 01:37:59 2015 UTC,Still not worth it. I'm dead serious.
PS4Deals,3c0s9y,mylittleandy,4,Sat Jul 4 09:20:39 2015 UTC,"I disagree, $15 is a good price."
PS4Deals,3c0s9y,Vanunanu,3,Sat Jul 4 17:07:24 2015 UTC,Thanks. I tried to pick up the Evil Within last sale but they had run out.
PS4Deals,3c0s9y,LiteralHiggs,2,Sat Jul 4 01:45:10 2015 UTC,great game. worth that price and more.
PS4Deals,3c0s9y,hamburgersandfries,2,Sat Jul 4 01:47:29 2015 UTC,I've been looking forward to playing it. I heard that it's a must for horror film fans and that it pays tribute to several sub-genres.

PS4Deals,3buwek,Insanctified,2,Thu Jul 2 15:23:00 2015 UTC,Rakuten is a huge online retailer. Quite reputable. I got my PS4 bundle from them. Couldn't have been simpler to work with.

Solid at best in my opinion, but it's reddit so anyone who disagrees with the norm is automatically downvoted."

But, you can reserve in store online for the advertised ($84.99) if they won't price match in store. You can always stand there reserve online with your phone and then have them give you the sale price if they are being uncooperative."

PS4Deals,3bpnbn,AP1s2k,3,Wed Jul 1 13:00:52 2015 UTC,Nevermind I got it to work. Had to go all the way to the place your order screen on mobile app to see it. I wish it would've automatically discounted me for pre ordering it a couple weeks ago. Oh well at least I got it now. Thanks!
PS4Deals,3bpnbn,Salaryman_Matt,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:20:01 2015 UTC,I had battlefront pre ordered and so I canceled and re added it to my cart. Still showing regular price. Physical copy too.
PS4Deals,3bpnbn,AP1s2k,2,Wed Jul 1 14:15:50 2015 UTC,It doesn't show in the cart itself.  You have to get all the way up to confirming the order to see the discount.  At least that's how it worked for me.
PS4Deals,3bpnbn,Mattg082,0,Wed Jul 1 18:51:28 2015 UTC,Yeah I finally figured that out! Thanks!
PS4Deals,3bpnbn,CalebTyler,-9,Wed Jul 1 20:21:18 2015 UTC,"Thats pretty much the exact equivilaent to my works discount on games. I usually get every new game at 49.99 unless i trade the last latest new game in and then its like a 15 dollar rental for 2-3 months if i do so. I like to wait till its 39.99 so i can get em for like 30 bucks! Always Black Friday! But those are the lowest discouy to everyone and the store actually loses money to gain sales through other items. I expect mk x,batman,bloodborne to be 25.99 come Black Friday with sept,nov lineup."
PS4Deals,3bpnbn,uscman480,4,Wed Jul 1 05:36:37 2015 UTC,Thanks for clarifying that!
PS4Deals,3bqed3,HRRB,2,Wed Jul 1 08:38:34 2015 UTC,Nice. Gonna go well with that E3 30 savings when I pre-ordered NHL+Division+Fallout.
PS4Deals,3bodjn,adoomaloom,14,Tue Jun 30 20:57:02 2015 UTC,This is the best price I've seen. Going to go to target and get the price match today. Thanks!
PS4Deals,3bodjn,absurdly_sarcastic,3,Tue Jun 30 21:31:22 2015 UTC,"I PM'd this at Target! Came to a bit less than 60 after tax. If you have a red card it should be ~55.  It's sold out online now though so I guess ymmv if you try this later~  Not as good as my G930 so far, but it was half the price (and my G930 receiver is broken D:) AND it actually works on the PS4, whereas the G930 had volume issues and no VSS. Awesome deal."

PS4Deals,3bodjn,Rytlock,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:15:27 2015 UTC,Upvote because you share my pain. Just did the math. Its like ~$57 just bought them at target. I'll do a casual ama tonight lol

PS4Deals,3bodjn,mylittleandy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:27:10 2015 UTC,What's the normal price on these headsets?
PS4Deals,3bodjn,TokyoAi,3,Tue Jun 30 22:34:23 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure they started at 99.99, but there's usually a sale going on somewhere, usually for 79.99 or thereabouts. This is definitely the best price I've seen though...might just have to jump on it."
PS4Deals,3bodjn,PeachyPunches,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:39:00 2015 UTC,"Just got a ps4, is there a reason to choose these headphones over a sennheiser hd598?"

PS4Deals,3bodjn,absurdly_sarcastic,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:25:09 2015 UTC,The HD598 does not have a microphone. Maybe the is ones about is more convenient for gaming?

PS4Deals,3bodjn,absurdly_sarcastic,4,Wed Jul 1 22:00:27 2015 UTC,It's funny how only have $55 and was looking for a deal on these yesterday. Patience comes a long way.
PS4Deals,3bodjn,Its11thPlanet,2,Tue Jun 30 22:05:28 2015 UTC,Nothing like holding out and finding a sweet deal.
PS4Deals,3bodjn,beaverskeet,4,Tue Jun 30 23:18:39 2015 UTC,I literally just got these price matched at target from Amazon for $78 yesterday! Wow

PS4Deals,3bodjn,beaverskeet,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:35:14 2015 UTC,The audio isn't stellar out of the controller.  That's all.
PS4Deals,3bodjn,ActionFlank,1 point,Wed Jul 1 09:22:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, was planning on just plugging into the reciver."
PS4Deals,3bodjn,beaverskeet,2,Wed Jul 1 10:59:55 2015 UTC,"I'd say stick with headphones.  The issue becomes the mic.  I nabbed a PlayStation Camera for cheap, so I use that as my mic.  I tried using a standalone clip mic through the controller and it didn't work, but I may not have had a setting correct."
PS4Deals,3bodjn,ActionFlank,3,Wed Jul 1 11:15:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i considered that, but i rarely play online, i never renewed my ps+ because of it. The only time i use my mic is in private parties with my friends, but we can use phones for that lol. Yeah the gold headset is great for ps4 but i would rather have something that is great with other stuff too. What phones do you use?"
PS4Deals,3bodjn,beaverskeet,3,Wed Jul 1 11:22:18 2015 UTC,"Sennheiser 598s.  Also have some AKG k240s.  Both of which sound better than the Golds, even with the silly game profile gimmick.  I use a mini amp and dac setup though.  Golds aren't bad for a headset, if one doesn't know any better.  They're a mediocre headphone with a Mic with a Sony stamp.  The only perk they have is being wireless, and for 50, I'd almost buy them again."
PS4Deals,3bodjn,ActionFlank,2,Wed Jul 1 13:02:38 2015 UTC,"Oh cool, i was looking into the 598's the other day! I have some Momemtums i ordered, cant wait to use them! If i used a mic i would totally get these for the 55$ but i had the sony silvers a few weeks ago (returned because of comfort issues) and the audio was great... On the ps4. Which amp do you have? Im new to this stuff and might get a little one if i get tired of the cord running all the way to the receiver."
PS4Deals,3bodjn,beaverskeet,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:08:41 2015 UTC,"Copied this from a previous post.  I'm in an apartment so I didn't want to bother with a proper receiver for good sound.  I have no idea if this setup is optimal, even on a budget build.  I was looking at stuff to build my own mixamp basically. And came up with this.  PlayStation 4 connects to the DAC via included optical cable.  FiiO D3 (D03K) Digital to Analog Audio Converter With Micca 6ft Optical Toslink Cable - 192kHz/24bit Optical and Coaxial DAC https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005K2TXMO/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_upIDvb0DZER6A  DAC connects to mini AMP via aux cable with 6.3mm adapter on one end. Adapter was on prime, but isn't now. Find something identical.  iMBAPrice® Premium High Quality Adapter STEREO GOLD Plug 1/4"" (6.3mm) Male to 1/8"" (3.5mm) Female - Gold Plated - Lifetime Warranty https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BE50BPO/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_ZsIDvb0Q0245E  iMBAPrice iMBA-PS-06MM 6-Feet Gold Plated 3.5mm Male to 3.5mm Male Stereo Audio Cable https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009UEAZ84/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_iqIDvb04VVSZQ  BEHRINGER MICROAMP HA400 https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KIPT30/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_MoIDvb1HVYJZY  You can now plug in 4 headphones each with their own amplified volume knob for about $70 plus tax. Audiophile headphones won't need plug adapters, and should be swappable between 6.3 and 3.5mm plugs.  To stay in your upper budget,  Sennheiser HD 558 Headphones https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004FEEY9A/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_-wIDvb0YDSD6W  If you want cheaper, but still better than any headset,  AKG K 240 Semi-Open Studio Headphones https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001ARCFA/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_wyIDvb1C3E4SK  There's your audio. If you want Mic capability on ps4, factor in the PlayStation Camera, which ranges from $40-60 I believe. It has a Mic built in that can be silenced from the controller.  If you move the setup to PC, you can add a separate cheap Mic, or get a nice Antlion Mic.  Let's see how well I formatted on mobile.  Ninja edit: both headphones are open, so sound will get out, but not the full volume you're hearing. Open headphones provide a better sound stage compared to closed, and provides all the 3d positioning you need. If you need closed headphones so you don't hear the room and they don't hear you, that can be arranged."
PS4Deals,3bodjn,ActionFlank,3,Wed Jul 1 13:38:49 2015 UTC,"Alright so by the time i checked this out it was long sold out, so I did a little cooking on paint and made it so it looked like it was still in stock, printed it out http://i.imgur.com/GUXFcqG.png  took it to my local best buy and i still got the deal   worked for me feel free to use it too"

PS4Deals,3bodjn,dontdonk,5,Wed Jul 1 00:02:12 2015 UTC,"Does an item have to be in stock to receive a price match?  Competitor online items must be in stock at the time a price match is requested.  That's from target, so I don't think it's possible to get a price match when it's out of stock on walmart's website. However, this can be read as if it wasn't in stock at Target either. So, I guess someone needs to try it out."
PS4Deals,3bodjn,Smartfart100,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:38:59 2015 UTC,"Did it less than a week ago at best buy, they have the same policy."
PS4Deals,3bodjn,newuxtreme,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:09:02 2015 UTC,"I went to Target this afternoon, once walmart had already sold out, and Target did price match.   It could have been the old lady behind the counter turning a blind eye, but I think all Targets will match because Walmart's site says Out of Stock Online, suggesting that it is in stock in some stores (none within 50 miles of me!)"
PS4Deals,3bodjn,ZerosevEx,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:06:00 2015 UTC,"Huh. Kind of makes me want to cancel my order and pick them up at Target, but I'd rather not risk it.

PS4Deals,3bnz64,DreadMcLaren,2,Tue Jun 30 19:13:14 2015 UTC,"Currently listed as $50, at best buy. Can get it down to $40 with GCU"
PS4Deals,3bnz64,SamuraiSevens,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:33:27 2015 UTC,"Is this game worth $40? I've been looking for a racing game for PS4, but didn't like DriveClub."
PS4Deals,3bnz64,kilroyishere89,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:54:01 2015 UTC,Its a very sim game. There is no real car collecting. If you has a wheel and playseat the experience will be better imo...
PS4Deals,3bnz64,luchapalooza,2,Tue Jun 30 23:00:38 2015 UTC,"I bought the game, but it just wasn't fun to me, so I returned it. Only get this if you are a die-hard simulation racing fan."
PS4Deals,3bnz64,moldy912,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:52:29 2015 UTC,Should add US store to title. It isn't discounted on the EU store

PS4Deals,3bmt0w,andrewchi,3,Tue Jun 30 14:11:47 2015 UTC,anyone know when new ps4 models with  physical button come to market
PS4Deals,3bmt0w,MaakuKiyoshi,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:35:35 2015 UTC,This seems like a pretty great deal. Can anyone vouch for the website/seller?
PS4Deals,3bmt0w,MFdust,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:36:18 2015 UTC,Looks like the deal goes through groupon. Logic buy just has the promo code to drop the price 10%. Definitely legit.
PS4Deals,3bmt0w,Conquerer-Destroyer,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:24:12 2015 UTC,You also get 1 year manufactures warranty and free returns
PS4Deals,3bmt0w,kingslayershand,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:06:53 2015 UTC,"You get a groupon discount code from Logicbuy, and I'm assuming Groupon is good and reputable, but I honestly have no idea."
PS4Deals,3bmt0w,LauKungPow,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:24:16 2015 UTC,Should I cash on this deal or wait for July 4th sales? $341 seems really good for a legit ps4 bundle
PS4Deals,3bmt0w,kingslayershand,4,Tue Jun 30 18:02:10 2015 UTC,Do places normally have good deals on gaming systems July 4th weekend?
PS4Deals,3bmt0w,dhalloffame,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:24:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not too sure actually, I saw that best buy was having a sale last year on July fourth, they bundled a ps4 last of us and a PlayStation superscription for $419"
PS4Deals,3bmt0w,kingslayershand,2,Tue Jun 30 19:04:35 2015 UTC,"I hope so. I'm looking to get the arkham knight bundle, and if I could get it for cheaper or with something else thrown in, that'd be great"
PS4Deals,3bmt0w,dhalloffame,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:06:03 2015 UTC,"You know what I just noticed there is a 14day free returns policy of the group on offer, so I might just Jump on this deal."
PS4Deals,3bmt0w,kingslayershand,2,Tue Jun 30 19:06:06 2015 UTC,You can get the last of us for $12 so i wouldnt bother with a bundle of that game

PS4Deals,3bmt0w,Zsaqwes8,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:40:22 2015 UTC,True if there are no just the consoles for cheaper
PS4Deals,3bmt0w,mark502,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:45:17 2015 UTC,So you guys think this would be a cheaper deal than best buy would offer?
PS4Deals,3bmt0w,Zsaqwes8,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:37:49 2015 UTC,"In my opinion yes, even if u get last of us for $12 the price of the console alone is going to be ~$329, and 329 for a 500gb ps4 is really good!"
PS4Deals,3bmt0w,kingslayershand,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:27:28 2015 UTC,I ordered this but its still processing. Anyone else having this? (Praying its not a sign that there aren't any more left.)
PS4Deals,3bmt0w,NOAHA202,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:11:36 2015 UTC,"Same thing here. The status has said ""Processing"" for the last 2 hours."
PS4Deals,3bmt0w,heyitsbean,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:40:51 2015 UTC,"I ordered, the website said processing for a few hours, and then payment was declined. My bank called me about unusual activity/fraud alert on my card.    Did it end up working for you?"

PS4Deals,3bluny,rufuslp,5,Tue Jun 30 07:11:39 2015 UTC,Can I remote play from another house? I have heard it needs to be on the same WiFi network. But has anyone tried it from a different location? Thanks
PS4Deals,3bluny,ScalaZen,4,Tue Jun 30 13:27:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can remote play from a different house."
PS4Deals,3bluny,SuperRobotPimpJesus,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:59:41 2015 UTC,Do you know what resolution they display at when playing remotely
PS4Deals,3bluny,ScalaZen,2,Wed Jul 1 21:34:35 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen the Vita outputs 720p on average, but I think it reaches 1080i (upscaling) when playing remotely."
PS4Deals,3bluny,SuperRobotPimpJesus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:56:55 2015 UTC,That would be great. Thanks.
PS4Deals,3bluny,ScalaZen,2,Thu Jul 2 14:57:49 2015 UTC,Just wanted to stop in and confirm for you after doing some quick testing. The Vita menu and most (possibly all) Vita games I have play at 720p. Remote Play runs at 1080i.
PS4Deals,3bluny,SuperRobotPimpJesus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:25:18 2015 UTC,I mostly want to play ps4 games remote play. so they will come out on 1080i?
PS4Deals,3bluny,ScalaZen,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:25:25 2015 UTC,There is something to consider with the higher resolutions that came to my mind; depending on the game there can be significant frame rate droppage. Sometimes as bad as 20 fps lower. Could also be the deal breaker for you.
PS4Deals,3bluny,SuperRobotPimpJesus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:39:03 2015 UTC,Ill just have to see for myself. hopefully i can manually change the resolution to get that stable FPS.
PS4Deals,3bluny,ScalaZen,4,Thu Jul 2 18:51:23 2015 UTC,This is what I was wondering as well. I would like to play co op with my brother but he is too cheap to buy a PS4! edit: Okay so i'm being down voted for my cheap brother? Okay Reddit.
PS4Deals,3bluny,Happy_Canadian,4,Tue Jun 30 14:03:43 2015 UTC,"You and your brother can play split screen, with one playing on the PS TV and one playing on the PS4."
PS4Deals,3bluny,SuperRobotPimpJesus,3,Wed Jul 1 00:12:37 2015 UTC,Thank you kind Sir/Jesus
PS4Deals,3bluny,Happy_Canadian,2,Wed Jul 1 00:41:29 2015 UTC,You still need to have a PS4 to stream it. I don't know if it works by both of you running it off one ps4 with both users on it. I'd like to know this as well
PS4Deals,3bluny,ScalaZen,7,Tue Jun 30 14:18:02 2015 UTC,"I am extremely uneducated so excuse me, but what can a PSTV do?"
PS4Deals,3bluny,LauKungPow,3,Tue Jun 30 16:23:16 2015 UTC,"PS TV can remote play your PS4, play compatible Vita games (digital and physical), play some other older games, stream PS Now, and the like."
PS4Deals,3bluny,SuperRobotPimpJesus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:02:45 2015 UTC,Is this worth it?
PS4Deals,3bluny,cavemandark,3,Tue Jun 30 13:22:34 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. 1. Do you have a PS4? 2. Do you intend to purchase PS NOW? 3. Will you be loaning the system to friends to play couch co-op or playing from other rooms in your house that often?  I know that these might seem like an idiotic questions but I bought the PS TV as a standalone unit to tide me over until I got a PS4 (with the intention to then use it with it). I'm currently waiting for a specific PS4 edition to be released. There are some issues with its capabilities and the functionality. However, if you answered yes to 1 and any of the other two then it's most likely worth the investment.  I'd wait for another bundle deal to drop though, you can get the PS TV, a vita memory card, a PS3 controller (loaner or trade-in value) and a digital copy of a PS3 game for not too much more money."
PS4Deals,3bluny,We-Are-All-Mad-Here,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:46:36 2015 UTC,"I sold my PS3 a year ago, so I use this mainly for playing PS1 classics. Works very well for that.   Remote streaming quality is entirely dependent on your internet and the connection type.   If you've never played Persona 4, I recommend picking it up along with a memory card."
PS4Deals,3bluny,xincasinooutx,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:03:42 2015 UTC,"Can you get netflix on this? I have a Roku 2 player right, was thinking about trading it in for PSTV if I can use it for netflix, amazon prime, youtube etc..."
PS4Deals,3bluny,nek4life,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:32:14 2015 UTC,Only if you have a PlayStation console. The PS TV does not have native Netflix app currently.
PS4Deals,3bluny,SuperRobotPimpJesus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:07:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I plan on getting a PS4 soon. Hoping the price drops a little, but probably won't be picking up the PSTV if I already have the console (only have one TV.) Unless there's a good reason to pick it up in addition."

PS4Deals,3bk1ci,rmill3r,0,Tue Jun 30 14:01:31 2015 UTC,"I'm currently 90 hours into the game. It's keeping my interest, but it's not a game that I can recommend to everyone. Much of the history you learn through the ""Codex"", a glorified encyclopedia in the options menu. A better option is to google, as there are a few websites that do a much better job at catching you up to speed. I commend the developers for putting together such a massive game, but it lacks a finishing touch in almost every aspect. Best way to describe it is a Jack of all trades, but a master of none. You just learn to live with the imperfections, and tailor the game's demands to your style and patience level.  The game begins on a map called Hinderlands. My advice to anyone is to do the main missions to advance the story and only as many side quests as your heart desires. They are rather tedious and can always be finished at a later time. The later maps are enjoyable and beautiful, but don't expect to be blown away by the story line. Again, jack of all trades, master of none.  Is it worth $30 dollars? Yes, if you are into rpgs that take a lot of time to get through. No otherwise."
PS4Deals,3bi3dy,poklane,5,Mon Jun 29 12:10:49 2015 UTC,I noticed that the UK has a price drop on PS4s for a limited time right now.  Any idea if this will come to the US?

PS4Deals,3bi3dy,GreenSkyFish,0,Tue Jun 30 02:09:30 2015 UTC,A direct exchange to the dollar would put the price right around US$450 though rarely is international pricing that direct. I suspect that the U.S. prices will be slightly lower.
PS4Deals,3bi3dy,archimedesfire,0,Tue Jun 30 13:41:16 2015 UTC,"I was just using Google, British pound (£) is $446 U.S. , Euro (€) would be $320."
PS4Deals,3beqjj,Acex117x,5,Sun Jun 28 15:31:22 2015 UTC,I was never a Souls fan. But I decided to give Bloodborne a shot and absolutely loved it. Really feel like it turned me around to their style of gameplay. Would it be a good idea to give Dark Souls 2 a try on ps4? Or should i go back to either Demon's Souls or Dark Souls 1?
PS4Deals,3beqjj,rmill3r,2,Mon Jun 29 15:10:37 2015 UTC,"Dark Souls 2 combat is slower paced and not as tight as in Bloodborne, and the world design is more linear; the director for Dark Souls 1, Demon Souls, and Bloodborne was not a large influence in the game design, and it shows. However, the online aspect is solid, and the combat is more varied. I've played Dark Souls 1 and 2 (on 360), and Bloodborne, and I am buying Dark Souls 2 for PS4. WIth the 3 DLCs included in this package, I'd say its worth it. Though you have to ask yourself what exactly made you love Bloodborne, because while the core mechanics are similar, the play styles in Dark Souls and Demon Souls are more methodical."
PS4Deals,3beqjj,ActionFlank,2,Mon Jun 29 17:52:22 2015 UTC,"Dark Souls 2 combat is slower paced and not as tight as in Bloodborne,   Drop your board, Nancy."

PS4Deals,3beqjj,TitletownMatt,4,Tue Jun 30 02:29:00 2015 UTC,Wow...just $35.96 with GCU.
PS4Deals,3beqjj,Datan124,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:16:23 2015 UTC,Odd question but w/o having gcu is there a way to view it at that price to price match at walmart?
PS4Deals,3beqjj,Discoteca,5,Sun Jun 28 19:10:35 2015 UTC,If you can't then get it from Amazon. It's $41.99 there right now.
PS4Deals,3beqjj,TitletownMatt,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:40:48 2015 UTC,No.  The 20% GCU discount is automatically applied to games in your Best Buy cart. Walmart wouldn't match that price anyway. It's also clearly marked as a promo price in your Best Buy cart.
PS4Deals,3beqjj,Datan124,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:34:11 2015 UTC,Ah i work for walmart the ad match policy is very vague on matching store cards like red card ect i could swing it id just have to have the price visible

PS4Deals,3bd4az,BamaFan87,0,Sun Jun 28 05:20:39 2015 UTC,"This game is by all reviews a rental. So, by with that considered, it is too expensive for a rental."
PS4Deals,3bd4az,Fruhmann,3,Sun Jun 28 14:19:57 2015 UTC,"True, but $19.99 minus whatever you resell it for, as a trade in or via eBay etc. Looking it from that perspective this might be an acceptable price point that allows you to play it at your own pace rather than trying to beat it in time to return it."
PS4Deals,3bd4az,AlonzoMoseley,0,Sun Jun 28 18:33:24 2015 UTC,Agreed.  It was a great rental for 3 bucks from Redbox.  This is the type of game that will be 7 bucks or less used at GameStop in a year or two as well.

PS4Deals,3ba00u,derrtybird,9,Sat Jun 27 15:01:47 2015 UTC,It expired in a week.   That's why i said it was about to expire.
PS4Deals,3ba00u,derrtybird,-2,Sat Jun 27 16:27:24 2015 UTC,That makes no sense. You're saving the $10 whether you use it now or in a year.
PS4Deals,3ba00u,cl0007,2,Sat Jun 27 17:44:02 2015 UTC,Rewards certificates have expiration dates.

PS4Deals,3ba00u,deadmau5312,17,Mon Jun 29 02:16:02 2015 UTC,"Subjective. It's a good price. But for me it was very much a rental only title. The environment looks amazing - so much work has gone into areas you run through without stopping and never return to. But it's short and you'll have no reason to play it again. Treat it like a movie... rent, watch, rewind and return."
PS4Deals,3ba00u,AlonzoMoseley,4,Sat Jun 27 05:42:40 2015 UTC,That's all I wanted to know thanks so much for your opinion!
PS4Deals,3ba00u,deadmau5312,3,Sat Jun 27 05:50:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hear it is really short."
PS4Deals,3ba00u,DudeGuy123,8,Sat Jun 27 06:14:48 2015 UTC,"I would definitely say so. I got it for $35 with credit from trading in some older mediocre games, and I've decided to keep it in my physical library.  My only ""problem"" with it is that it is short, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing for me. I don't have as much time to game as I used to, so the 7 to 9 hour campaign (not including trophies hunting) was great for me. The gameplay was admittedly mediocre cover based stuff, but I found the story interesting enough and just taking in all of the scenery and beauty put into this game made me feel like it deserves to be a part of my physical collection."

PS4Deals,3ba00u,BadNewsBrown,0,Sat Jun 27 15:33:04 2015 UTC,What is GCU?
PS4Deals,3ba00u,FoolOnThePlanet91,3,Sat Jun 27 14:30:03 2015 UTC,"It's Best Buy's Gamer's Club Unlocked program. The main benefit of it is that you get 20% off all unused games (and 10% off all used games). You also receive double rewards points as well as some other benefits. It's only $30 for a 2-year membership, so it's actually a great deal even if you buy just a few games per year. Obviously its value increases as you buy more with it, but even after 3 purchases of games that normally cost $60 it's pretty much paid for itself."
PS4Deals,3ba00u,comestible_lemon,-14,Sat Jun 27 14:32:35 2015 UTC,Still not worth it. It came free with my PS4 and it's still not worth it.

PS4Deals,3b8dg1,countrymike,31,Fri Jun 26 20:10:13 2015 UTC,Pretty lame discounts for a flash sale.  Maybe next month will be a good one.
PS4Deals,3b8dg1,mesenkomaha,9,Fri Jun 26 21:48:08 2015 UTC,"I think the discounts are nice... but the selection of games is kinda lame. Kind of a forced ""Fantasy"" theme."
PS4Deals,3b8dg1,HotBeefyMcD,3,Sat Jun 27 00:03:06 2015 UTC,"Has anyone played Hand of Fate? How is it? It seems kind of interesting.  I'll be picking up the Telltale Game of Thrones season pass though, I've loved their other games that I've played (though I haven't actually watched Game of Thrones yet).  I'll probably also get LEGO The Hobbit, and I'm considering Shadow Warrior - looks pretty insane!"
PS4Deals,3b8dg1,jdimaria3,8,Fri Jun 26 21:00:42 2015 UTC,"That Game of Thrones game actually spoils a couple of really major points of Seasons 3 and 4 of the show. And honestly, if you're not a fan of the show, this is really one of Telltale's weaker offerings, IMO. Still good if you're a fan, but not as accessible as, say, TWD or A Wolf Among US if you weren't into the comic already.  Shadow Warrior, on the other hand, is just a wonderfully over-the-top FPS with surprisingly great melee/sword combat... and very satisfying dismemberment. I bought it for $6 during a previous Flash Sale and instantly fell in love. For $7.50, I'd say it's worth the gamble."

I feel terrible for Canadian gamers, seriously. They're really raked over the coals with these game prices. :("
PS4Deals,3az4hu,kotogo,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:57:42 2015 UTC,$60 USD = 75$ CAD  So we still are getting a good deal
PS4Deals,3az4hu,Exonity,0,Wed Jun 24 22:55:42 2015 UTC,Glance again and realize the value of the USD. We think they are getting screwed when really it's the value of the USD that is dwindling down to nothing.

PS4Deals,3az4hu,WZeddemore84,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:48:21 2015 UTC,"FYI - you have pre-order price guarantees for these so you will get the lowest price the game goes on sale for at any time from now till it's released.  This game is $59.96 now, but it it goes to $55.99 or $49.99 before it's released you will get that price.  So, add on a $79.99 game if you want.  Who knows? It could go down to $59.99 too!"

And as a Canadian, I don'y want to pay $79.99 for a new game.   It merely shows the devs that people are interested in their game."

PS4Deals,3aw1iv,thebochman,2,Wed Jun 24 04:19:37 2015 UTC,I heard Lords of the Fallen is a lot like Dark Souls
PS4Deals,3aw1iv,titanhermant,2,Wed Jun 24 04:35:41 2015 UTC,"It's in the same genre, and has some things it does better like inventory and menus. Aesthetically it reminds me somewhat of Warhammer, with ridiculously over designed  big armor. It's not a bad game, just not a very good one"
PS4Deals,3aw1iv,WearyWeasel,2,Wed Jun 24 06:34:45 2015 UTC,"I'm buying lords for $20. I borrowed it from a friend and honestly I enjoyed it, put like 16 hours in before I had to give it back.  It's like a dark souls game that you can play without worrying about dying every step you take. There are still some challenging bosses and hordes of enemies can really mess you up, but it's not like dark souls where you are on the edge of your seat the entire game and die every ten seconds unless you know where all the enemies are.  Not sure about replayability but for $20 I'll get some good fun out of it, finishing the game I started. It's not amazing or anything but I personally liked it, as an easier dark souls game."
PS4Deals,3aw1iv,jdimaria3,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:29:52 2015 UTC,"TWD S1 is amazing, and S2 is pretty good but not quite as good. I'd definitely pick them up if I was you, especially if you like a good story that changes based on your choices"
PS4Deals,3aw1iv,thebochman,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:13:49 2015 UTC,I was playing the first episode of the GoT game and was seriously impressed by how well done it was. Felt like an actual episode of the show.
PS4Deals,3aw1iv,jdimaria3,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:40:38 2015 UTC,"If you liked that, you'd likely also like TWD considering it's the same style of game. I actually like the story in the game more than most of the show"
PS4Deals,3aw1iv,InsaneTurtle,-1,Wed Jun 24 16:15:34 2015 UTC,"Watch Dogs is boring. Wolfenstein,  TWD 1 and 2 are really good. Isn't much to do in UFC unless you only plan on playing online. It's not better than the older THQ Undisputed series."
PS4Deals,3aw1iv,thebochman,2,Wed Jun 24 04:17:39 2015 UTC,"I only was thinking about UFC so I could finally fight as Urijah Faber, seeing as the last game I have is UFC 2009 before the WEC/UFC merger"
PS4Deals,3aw1iv,InsaneTurtle,3,Wed Jun 24 04:37:04 2015 UTC,"You should pick up UFC 2010. The Pride feature is great. I never played the 3rd one. In EA UFC, all of the fighters fight the same. There is no uniqueness. But graphically, it looks nice."

PS4Deals,3aucrw,bstones,-3,Wed Jun 24 16:32:14 2015 UTC,Pre-orders and release day sales must be weak for this game if it's being discounted already.  I bet they thought a summer release might work in their favor by not having to compete with other releases.  My gut says to hold off.  It could be $40 in a week.
PS4Deals,3aucrw,Aram_Fingal,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:53:56 2015 UTC,"Target has done a lot of sales like this before on new games, movies and music. It has nothing to do with the game being weak.   I remember buying a deal like this for Bloodborne and a PSN card earlier this year, too."

PS4Deals,3asdx8,THUMB5UP,6,Tue Jun 23 15:42:55 2015 UTC,"If I loved Little Big Planet 1 and 2, is 3 worth $30?"
PS4Deals,3asdx8,uscman480,5,Tue Jun 23 05:24:18 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, yes. I also loved LBP 1 and 2, and 3 was more of the same formula that I already knew I liked. Yes, adventure mode is short, but that was never really the main attraction of LBP games; the stuff people come up with with all the new tools is crazy, and being able to play the old levels as well is a treat.   A common criticism are some numerous online issues that make it hard to play with friends, though my friends and I, from day 1, have never had that problem. Hopefully you'd experience the same luck as me.  But yeah, the characters are still adorable, adventure mode is still quirky and funny, creation is even more in-depth and extensive, multiplayer with friends is very entertaining (should it work), the soundtrack is great, graphics are decent, and the amount of content is pretty damn good for only $30 bucks. Plus, if you don't like it for some reason, you're getting the physical version, so you can always return it or re-sell it down the road."
PS4Deals,3asdx8,jquickri,3,Tue Jun 23 05:38:53 2015 UTC,"Imo no. I,have it and almost never play it after running through the very short story with the gf which admittedly was fun). I feel like the slow start meant that the wealth of community levels never really took off. Online play breaks for me. Also the old levels don't work often because of new physics. Really hard to find levels unless using the app."
PS4Deals,3asdx8,RhubarbCharb,2,Tue Jun 23 13:24:40 2015 UTC,No way. It's no way near as long as the other games. I couldn't believe I had finished it when I did.

PS4Deals,3asdx8,ishkabibbel2000,3,Tue Jun 23 13:58:02 2015 UTC,I've bought 6 games so far from Gamefly. Each and every game was in pristine condition. With original boxes and all inserts included.

PS4Deals,3avcjs,ShinyBloke,8,Tue Jun 23 20:18:39 2015 UTC,This game is never worth looking at (unless you have friends who suffer play this with you).

PS4Deals,3avcjs,thebochman,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:16:45 2015 UTC,I thought the same damn thing. I got it for $20...then resealed it and returned it at target... It was that bad that I couldn't handle not getting my money back. Unless you have 4 friends to play this then save your money.
PS4Deals,3avcjs,mylittleandy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:23:13 2015 UTC,Can you go more in detail?
PS4Deals,3avcjs,thebochman,2,Wed Jun 24 03:28:40 2015 UTC,Ok so my first gripe was that there didn't seem to be any story mode. If that makes sense. Just the same match mode. Ok next you have to rank which class you'd like to be and the game would do its best to sort you into that class. So even if you hated being a engineer you have the chance to be him. I ended up being an engineer a match and I spent 15 min chasing down this monster... I felt like none of my attacks were effective and times I just ended up putting my controller down. Then if you're the monster some maps are so bad you know you're going to lose. I will say I only owned this for a week. Still man. If you have friends who have mics it would be fun you know?
PS4Deals,3avcjs,mylittleandy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:19:33 2015 UTC,The game + this pass are on the PSStore for $40 rn as well.   Edit: Canadian price. Not sure about US.   Edit 2: season pass without the game is on there for $14.99

However, they were able to help me out. They gave me an extra $50 for my 360 trade. So for the 360, I got $15 for the hdd, $20 for the console which they upped to $70. So I got $85 for my 360.

I'd assume by the end of the month (which is the release of the new model) there will be better deals than this on the first generation. I'd hold out. Just my 2 cents.
PS4Deals,3apur8,grey_sky,3,Mon Jun 22 19:00:33 2015 UTC,We have no idea when the new one will hit the U.S. Could be end of the summer. $350 with no tax is not that bad of a deal if you don't want to play the waiting game.
PS4Deals,3apur8,mnsportsgeek,-11,Tue Jun 23 00:59:13 2015 UTC,Hahaha bullshit
PS4Deals,3apur8,JesusFromTheSouth,2,Mon Jun 22 19:35:43 2015 UTC,Care to explain why you think it's bullshit? We've already seen gen 1 go for much lower than $350 without a new model being released. It doesn't seem so far fetched to see the older model get discounted by some stores wanting to make way for the new generation which is at the same price point.
PS4Deals,3apur8,grey_sky,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:40:37 2015 UTC,"$350 is pretty low though, haven't seen a PS4 bundle for lower myself (maybe haven't looked hard enough). And who knows when the new model will be released in NA."
PS4Deals,3apur8,DrSeafood,3,Tue Jun 30 04:54:02 2015 UTC,how does warranty work with considering the seller is not a authorized dealer.
PS4Deals,3apt3f,swotam,5,Mon Jun 22 14:57:23 2015 UTC,"Use Coupon Code SAVE20E3 at checkout to see price adjustment. You must pre-order at least 2 games for the discount to apply. Discount only applies to ""regular"" versions of a game, and does not apply to Limited, Collector, blah blah editions.  Offer ends at 11:59 PST on June 25  Given that the MSRP of new PS4 games in Canada is now between $69.99 - $79.99 depending on the game, saving 20% definitely helps. Note that Amazon.ca does not charge for pre-orders until the game ships, and that you can cancel any items in your order at any time prior to shipment at no cost.  I've been pre-ordering from Amazon.ca during their E3 sale for a couple of years now and it's worked out really well. I get the games I want at a discounted price, I cancel the games I decide I don't want without penalty as long as I cancel before they ship, and I don't pay until the game actually ships. They also offer price protection on the order, so if the price drops for any reason between the time you order and the time the game ships, you pay the lowest price during that time, and then they deduct the E3 discount on top of that.  TL;DR Order anything you think you might want, and then cancel the items you decide you don't want later. This way you'll get the discount on the games you do decide to keep, no matter if they ship next week or next year."

PS4Deals,3apt3f,Onionsteak,2,Mon Jun 22 16:56:04 2015 UTC,"I pre-ordered Arkham Knight last year (E3 2014 sale) back when the MSRP was $59.99, so it'll end up costing me about $47 with tax. :)"

PS4Deals,3apt3f,kpumukster,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:21:45 2015 UTC,"How does this work with pre-orders bundle?. I got MGS+Ghost Recon(130). One comes in Sept, and Ghost Recon next year. Would they take the combine total $$ of $130 once MGS releases, or half of $130 each time?."
PS4Deals,3apt3f,Screamin11,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:46:34 2015 UTC,"You would get 20% off the price of each item at the time it shipped, at least that's how it's always worked for me. So when MGSV ships in September you'll get 20% off whatever the lowest price it sells for between now and then, and then when Ghost Recon ships next year you'll get 20% off at that time."
PS4Deals,3apt3f,Tucker1988,4,Mon Jun 22 19:43:55 2015 UTC,A few days ago it was 30%...wasn't it? Wonder why they removed that deal.
PS4Deals,3apt3f,Eximizer,2,Mon Jun 22 16:58:20 2015 UTC,"It was a deal during E3, for 3 days. After that they removed ""3+ games with 30% discount"", but kept 20% (still nice)"
PS4Deals,3apt3f,Tucker1988,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:23:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah it ended on the 18th unfortunately. I managed to snag 6 games, it is quickly becoming the go-to yearly sale to avoid Black Friday/Boxing Day madness."
PS4Deals,3apt3f,Eximizer,2,Mon Jun 22 17:30:00 2015 UTC,Yeah I bought 8 last year with the sale and waited for this year and ordered 14 (though already cancelled 2). I'm sure I'll cancel a few more on the way but glad I could get them for cheaper (about $50 per game with taxes included) again this year.
PS4Deals,3apt3f,Tucker1988,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:09:10 2015 UTC,Do you think the 30% sale will happen again this year?
PS4Deals,3apt3f,Eximizer,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:11:27 2015 UTC,Probably not. Last year was just during e3.
PS4Deals,3apt3f,J-CAMPS,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:18:44 2015 UTC,"Damn that's shame. I want to order atleast 3 games, but knowing that there was a 30% deal a few days ago... I wouldn't feel too good about saving 20%."
PS4Deals,3apt3f,J-CAMPS,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:22:01 2015 UTC,True but probably feel worse if you get 0% off games you were going to buy anyways. Could preorder them and if a better deal comes along you can c angel before they ship.
PS4Deals,3apt3f,DextersQuest,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:29:36 2015 UTC,True. I just pre ordered 2 games I really wanted. Thanks for your advice.
PS4Deals,3apt3f,DextersQuest,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:24:41 2015 UTC,"They had a ""buy 2 get 20% off, buy 3 or more get 30% off"" during E3 week, so I guess they decided to bring the 20% off back for people who didn't get 30% off last week."
PS4Deals,3aq5gl,ralphyb0b,7,Mon Jun 22 16:34:03 2015 UTC,Still way too high imo.

PS4Deals,3aq5gl,uscman480,3,Mon Jun 22 19:01:40 2015 UTC,"Actually, at least in my one experience trying this, Walmart does NOT price match online prices in stores. Their online site is owned by a third-party. They will allow in-store pickup, but depending on what time of day you place the order, you might not be able to pick it up until the next day. It's a convoluted pain in the ass."

PS4Deals,3anzbo,sakonpure6,2,Mon Jun 22 04:56:45 2015 UTC,"I bought it a few weeks ago finally, and I'm blasting through it and loving absolutely every second of it from the combat, to exploration, lore, and more (and this is coming from one of those people who dropped Dark Souls in the first few hours because it was ""too hard,"" ""too frustrating,"" etc.).   I don't necessarily think it's easier than the Souls games (although some hardcore Souls fans say it is), but it's different and in my opinion a good introduction into the way From Software's games operate (if you're not already a fan). After this, I really feel like I'll be able to go back to Demon's Souls and Dark Souls 1 and 2 and enjoy and appreciate them a lot more.   It's pretty much why I bought a PS4 and if you own a PS4 and like action/RPG/adventure games in any way, it'd be ridiculous if you don't already own this."

Some guides online recommend using this one but assume you have to destroy the external casing in the process. Well, you don't have to, if you're careful you can put the old PS4 HDD into the external casing and keep using it. Maybe stuff it with some MKV's and plug it back into your PS4 and enjoy the new media player ;)"

I, and a lot of people, think this is the best option for upgrading the PS4's internal drive.  Just pop open the external drive casing and remove the hard drive. Swap it out with your PS4's drive and either restore your backup or do a fresh OS install. Meanwhile, your original drive can go back into the case to give you a bonus USB3 external drive, once you've reformatted the drive."

PS4Deals,3ajawj,BradPatt,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:21:00 2015 UTC,You need another drive to do the backup. The very act of putting a drive into the PS4 triggers a requirement to do a fresh install. After that you can restore from another drive.

PS4Deals,3ajawj,Ellenpaosdirtycooch,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:24:28 2015 UTC,I actually just used this exact drive to upgrade mine yesterday. It was so simple. Only took about 30 minutes to swap out the drives and install the firmware. It's working perfectly. Only downside is reloading all your games.
PS4Deals,3ajawj,Ellenpaosdirtycooch,-16,Mon Jun 22 15:15:29 2015 UTC,It's not the best option. 2TB versus 1TB fills up just as fast and you'll be deleting games in no time. Best to go with a 1TB SSHD and get much faster loading times.  e: the downvote tells everyone but the crybaby who did it that I'm right.
PS4Deals,3ajawj,Ellenpaosdirtycooch,2,Sun Jun 21 12:39:05 2015 UTC,"Most people (particularly who browse this sub) will be factoring price while weighing the best option, so at 4-5 times the price, a 1TB SSD drive will probably not be their best option. Otherwise why not just go for a 2TB SSD? Only ~$3000 at the moment."
PS4Deals,3ajawj,Jrelis,-1,Sun Jun 21 17:31:15 2015 UTC,A SSHD 1TB drive is ~70 on amazon.
PS4Deals,3ajawj,Dustoned,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:43:39 2015 UTC,"Hands up I misread your comment as relating to SSD rather than SSHD, and I suspect a few others may have too.  However, I often point to this comparison between SSHD and HDD: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyZuSc-n6fM  Yes in some cases there's a noticeable difference, but it's not going to change your life and the convenience of double the space (and fewer deletions and lengthy re-downloads) outweighs it for most. If shaving a few seconds off loading times is your goal, then a 7200RPM HDD might do the trick just as well."
PS4Deals,3ajawj,prickshaw,0,Sun Jun 21 18:04:23 2015 UTC,It isn't a few seconds. It is 15s on GTA and 25% faster on Bloodborne for quick examples.

Since there's a standard 3.5mm headphone jack, you can simply buy a set of earbuds with an inline microphone. They'll sound just as good, and you won't have to worry bout wearing a massive headset in the summer months. Plus, you can use it on your phone as well.   I use the official PS Vita headset. ~$10 on amazon, very comfortable, and the sound quality is superb."

PS4Deals,3afjjx,trekitch,2,Sat Jun 20 01:53:27 2015 UTC,Just set audio output to all audio instead of chat only audio.
PS4Deals,3afjjx,AceTheIceman,1 point,Sat Jun 20 09:18:00 2015 UTC,"There's a way to make it play through both earpieces. Mine did it automatically, but you might have to look into device settings or something."
PS4Deals,3afjjx,Pittsteelerfan86,2,Sat Jun 20 02:01:07 2015 UTC,For people like me who hate using ear buds. They hurt like hell after awhile no matter how they are inserted.   The gold headsets are excellent as long as you're charging them when not in use.
PS4Deals,3afjjx,pickafuckinname,3,Sat Jun 20 16:01:57 2015 UTC,"For sure, I feel the same with ear buds after a while too (i.e. 45 min. of use).  You could get custom mold/fit earbuds but they cost significantly more money and I don't think it's worth it (unless you have super disposable income)."
PS4Deals,3afjjx,AceTheIceman,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:36:54 2015 UTC,Really? that's strange. I regularly use earbuds for 3-4 hours straight when I play PS4 at night.

PS4Deals,3afjjx,darmakwolf,0,Sat Jun 20 21:13:50 2015 UTC,Because not everyone likes earbuds? And headsets usually offer better noise cancelling and audio quality?
PS4Deals,3afjjx,AceTheIceman,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:25:39 2015 UTC,"The difference is negligible. If you still believe that headsets sound better than decent quality earbuds, you probably think that ""MLG PRO 7.1 SURROUND SOUND CALL OF DUTY EDITION TRITTON"" headsets make you better at video games.   I'm not sure if you've ever used earbuds, but they cancel noise very well. Not sure what you're talking about with either of your points."
PS4Deals,3afjjx,darmakwolf,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:32:53 2015 UTC,Of course I've used earbuds. Also I use Sennheisers. The bigger the sound driver the more power the sound has. You can only get so much out of earbuds.
PS4Deals,3afjjx,AceTheIceman,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:40:56 2015 UTC,"Right. You can also only drive so much with a PS4 controller, though. Unless you're planning on using an amp connected to your PS4 controller, you aren't gonna use Sennheiser cans."
PS4Deals,3afjjx,coreyisbatman,2,Mon Jun 29 01:52:00 2015 UTC,This headset came with my bundle a few weeks back and it is awful. It is so tight around my ears and after an hour of playing my head is just in pain.

What does amaze me, however, is that this game is still selling for such a high price at it's age-- I feel like I beat this game years ago. I'd pay twenty bucks to play it through again, but there have been better price points than this."

PS4Deals,3ah61s,ImThatGuyYouDontKnow,2,Sat Jun 27 01:41:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, PSN does this ""sale"" regularly, the thing is you're only saving $10 off retail and they're making it look like you're saving more by giving you free virtual money for the online portion of the game. Not a great deal if you ask me.  To be honest I haven't seen any really good deals on GTA V digitally, although there have been some OK deals in the US from WalMart and places like that.  Considering that the remaster of the game came out last November, it's about due for a sale that offers more than $10 off IMO, and considering that I already played the game on PS3 I won't be looking at the PS4 version until it drops down to the $30 - $35 range."
PS4Deals,3ah61s,hokies15,2,Mon Jun 22 15:10:35 2015 UTC,Oh good.  Full priced 'sale' for a two year old game.  Thanks Rockstar!

PS4Deals,3a65bm,mesenkomaha,3,Wed Jun 17 21:01:32 2015 UTC,"It was already released on IGC, although for PS3.  Snatch this up for 12 bucks because it isn't likely to be on PS plus again."
PS4Deals,3a65bm,Mypetmummy,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:38:26 2015 UTC,I'd guess rather high. It's a AAA title at a budget price so it's likely to slip into the PS+ lineup in the next few months...unless they don't want to promote the XBOX timed exclusive sequel by doing so.
PS4Deals,3a65bm,FictionaI,0,Wed Jun 17 21:23:53 2015 UTC,I'm assuming it will be relatively soon based on how far it's being discounted.

PS4Deals,3a6tmv,FizzyLifting,5,Thu Jun 18 03:05:14 2015 UTC,For the most part... I played through it couple weeks ago. Two times the game randomly crashed and booted me back to the playstation menu. My character got stuck in the environment a couple times as well and I had to fast travel somewhere on the map to get out of it. I also noticed some Co-Op mission objectives will glitch forcing you to quit and reattempt them.

PS4Deals,3a7a5e,mesenkomaha,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:09:44 2015 UTC,I normally jump on this deal when they offer it but this time the sales are so bad that it isn't worth doing.  Maybe next time.
PS4Deals,3a7a5e,pr0adam,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:01:13 2015 UTC,possible stupid question but would preordering Ratchet and Clank and UC collection count towards this?
PS4Deals,3a7a5e,flatliner718,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:36:52 2015 UTC,It does count. Any and all money spent during this period.
PS4Deals,3a7a5e,pr0adam,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:02:51 2015 UTC,OK cool 😎
PS4Deals,3a7a5e,JoeChrist34,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:37:11 2015 UTC,Does this count for purchased games only? or could I redeem the offer just by adding that amount of funds to my wallet/or say buying a $100 gift certificate?
PS4Deals,3a7a5e,dehli,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:46:21 2015 UTC,Has anyone gotten the $15 back yet?  Edit: Not sure why I'm getting downvoted for asking a valid question.
PS4Deals,3a7a5e,Rizzwan,2,Sun Jun 21 20:32:17 2015 UTC,You'll receive a voucher code for the $15 on or before July 7th via e-mail or psn message
PS4Deals,3a7a5e,dehli,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:38:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I had seen that, and it's why I asked. Before July 7th means that some people could have already received it."
PS4Deals,3a7a5e,dmg051793,0,Thu Jun 18 23:59:43 2015 UTC,"Sorry if this has been asked before, but does this include preorders?"
PS4Deals,3a7a5e,Rizzwan,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:55:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, its the entirety of the store."
PS4Deals,3a7a5e,Novast,0,Thu Jun 18 22:10:05 2015 UTC,I am pretty sure I know the answer to this but I bought something for 39.99 and 59.99 so I am 2 cents off of $100.  Do I need to buy one more thing to get this deal?
PS4Deals,3a7a5e,gabbagabbas,2,Fri Jun 19 00:00:49 2015 UTC,This hardly even seems worth answering but yes.
PS4Deals,3a46gh,dylang5,7,Wed Jun 17 02:22:14 2015 UTC,"What's stopping me from buying another PS4, getting Bloodborne, then returning the PS4 and keeping the game?"
PS4Deals,3a46gh,Locksmith_J,8,Wed Jun 17 11:37:40 2015 UTC,"Fine print, probably."
PS4Deals,3a46gh,Dingo54,3,Wed Jun 17 12:40:49 2015 UTC,I just went to gamestop and it's separate from the bundle. They list it on the receipt as free from the promotion.
PS4Deals,3a46gh,n1ghtxf4ll,3,Wed Jun 17 21:45:20 2015 UTC,I just literally purchased this bundle and they said that you would get $0 for returning it since there was no initial price for it.  You could trade it in to get its trade in value.
PS4Deals,3a46gh,defiledhero,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:52:43 2015 UTC,"Uhh... I guess nothing, but its a bundle deal, so it may be included when you return the ps4."
PS4Deals,3a46gh,chazzlabs,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:29:12 2015 UTC,The page you linked doesn't make it sound like a bundle.  It sounds like you get the PS4/TLOU bundle and Game Stop gives you a copy of Bloodborne for free.
PS4Deals,3a46gh,n1ghtxf4ll,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:57:23 2015 UTC,"Well, it clearly says bundle. You're right though, that is what they're doing."
PS4Deals,3a46gh,Nyynks212,3,Wed Jun 17 18:03:04 2015 UTC,I just bought a PS4 from gamestop couple days ago. Haven't opened it yet specifically because I knew they were going to release some sort of bundle soon! Looks like I'll be going in tomorrow to pick this up.
PS4Deals,3a46gh,Nyynks212,2,Wed Jun 17 08:07:05 2015 UTC,do we have any idea if new bundles or a reduced price is coming before the holidays? i've been holding out wondering if anything new would come up with E3
PS4Deals,3a46gh,Kammatrix,2,Thu Jun 18 23:36:55 2015 UTC,"It was speculated for a price drop or the 1TB model, but still no word. All you can do is wait, unfortunately."
PS4Deals,3a46gh,stretch_21,2,Thu Jun 18 23:43:52 2015 UTC,ok yeah that's what i thought i had seen

PS4Deals,3a46gh,Munstered,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:54:48 2015 UTC,Does anyone know if Gamestop gives a significant amount of money for trading in a PS3 slim? Want to know if it's worth doing.
PS4Deals,3a46gh,stretch_21,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:24:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if that deal is still going on, but definitely call your local GameStop and ask."
PS4Deals,3a46gh,Munstered,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:00:21 2015 UTC,"If you go to gamestop's website, you can look up the trade in value of the console and any extra controllers you have."
PS4Deals,3a46gh,oneeyeclosed86,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:04:08 2015 UTC,Honestly right now you should take that to best buy. They're doing $175 toward a PS4 with PS3 trade-in
PS4Deals,3a46gh,LauKungPow,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:07:28 2015 UTC,Do you know if Best Buy still offers that deal for the PS4? I only see the $175 trade-in towards an Xbox One.
PS4Deals,3a4a1o,Citrus_Injection,2,Wed Jun 17 02:54:55 2015 UTC,God I wish bestbuy would get it back in stock.
PS4Deals,3a4a1o,livinxloud13,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:01:17 2015 UTC,When is the last time that you checked?  You preordered one from Best Buy this past weekend.    *edit-Just looked online and looks like it's not available anymore.  Any reason you want to order it from Best Buy besides wanting to put it on a Best Buy Card?
PS4Deals,3a4a1o,Edw1nner,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:15:14 2015 UTC,Just to put it on my card is the only reason. Was going to order it after work yesterday but when I got home it was sold out.
PS4Deals,3a4a1o,livinxloud13,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:13:43 2015 UTC,I was hesitant to order it but went ahead and did knowing that I could return it if I changed my mind.  Glad I did.  At least there are still other retailers that have it available if you really want it.
PS4Deals,3a4a1o,Edw1nner,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:20:22 2015 UTC,I'll probably just wait for another bundle that interests me. If only the mgs5 console would come to the US I'd for sure get that one.

PS4Deals,3a3oyf,SpagettInTraining,2,Tue Jun 16 23:56:49 2015 UTC,"I'm waiting to get mine next week, when it comes bundled with Batman (a $60 game).  Walmart, Target, and other retailers are trying to unload their stock of the Last of Us bundles now before the new systems hit stores.  You can get the code for Last of Us for $10 - $12 on ebay"
PS4Deals,3a3oyf,fantoman,-12,Wed Jun 17 05:20:10 2015 UTC,Exactly what Im doing. Played Last of Us when I had a ps3 and wasnt impressed. More interested in Batman.

PS4Deals,3a3oyf,zxrod,2,Wed Jun 17 16:08:15 2015 UTC,I wonder if they're offering that bundle in store?  *looks like they are
PS4Deals,3a3oyf,435354,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:58:42 2015 UTC,"What I did was get the deal, but buy it completely on a Citi credit card. Wal-Mart rings the games and console up separately, so now I'm doing a Citi price rewind on the games. I got Diablo and COD, so the PlayStation was $350 and the games will end up being $20ish each.   Check your credit card for policies on price rewinding. Hell, you might even be able to just select the most expensive games and return them; like I said, Wal-Mart rang up the games separately, so they might just say ""They're separate items on the receipt, so you can get your money back."""

PS4Deals,3a3oyf,ZeKron_the_Mortifier,3,Tue Jun 16 23:58:10 2015 UTC,Driveclub is significantly better than nfs rivals from a racing perspective.
PS4Deals,3a3oyf,Inframidi,2,Wed Jun 17 17:30:43 2015 UTC,"When I clicked on it, nfs rivals wasn't an option.  You get that game, last of us, and u pick the other."
PS4Deals,3a3oyf,jo1993,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:50:30 2015 UTC,"I'd probably recommend Diablo. I don't own it but I've heard nothing but good things about it. That or Shadow of Mordor.   All the sports games are coming out with new versions soon (Madden 16, Fifa 16 and NHL is bare bones this year). And you probably won't want Drive Club if you're getting NFSR."
PS4Deals,3a3oyf,435354,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:48:14 2015 UTC,NFS rivals was a failure. Wait for the NFS reboot coming soon or any of the other racing games out now.

PS4Deals,3a2k3d,Sincitysir1,5,Tue Jun 16 20:35:35 2015 UTC,"The 50 one also has a ghost shell, ship and emblem. Of those nobody uses the ship or emblem really. The 80 one gets you what you mentioned plus some exotic class items, emotes and I think an emblem. The 80 one is definitely the better value probably."
PS4Deals,3a2k3d,Soltanus,9,Tue Jun 16 21:55:42 2015 UTC,Definitely probably lol
PS4Deals,3a2k3d,echov,2,Wed Jun 17 00:01:49 2015 UTC,Thank you! That definitely helps me decide

PS4Deals,3a2k3d,nm1043,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:08:15 2015 UTC,If I wanted to get into destiny would it be worth getting either of these or just getting it on Amazon for $20 and waiting for a sale on the DLC?
PS4Deals,3a2k3d,lotrking1010,3,Wed Jun 17 01:14:07 2015 UTC,"DLC for consoles do not often go on sale. Not like they do on Steam. If you are looking to get into the game, I'd say look for a copy of the Taken King with all 3 games.  The expansion alone is 40 dollars. So for 40 more dollars, you get the base game and both previous DLC packs. So figure you're getting the game for 20, and both packs for 10 (they are 20 separately right now or both for 35 dollars for the foreseeable future).  I mean if you just want to try the game, you can just get the base game, and you can still play the crucible pvp and some of the strike playlists. But all nightfalls and weeklies require the expansions. Also most of the current players seem to want people to be level 32 or higher just to run old raids like the Vault of Glass (the only raid you can run on the base game)."
PS4Deals,3a2k3d,Soltanus,3,Wed Jun 17 02:06:26 2015 UTC,"I recommend getting the Legendary Edition releasing this September, it includes the base game, The Dark Below (DLC1), House of Wolves (DLC2), and The Taken King (the new DLC launching in September) for $60 (the new DLC alone is $40)"
PS4Deals,3a2k3d,xXSushiSanXx,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:52:37 2015 UTC,"hmmm $80 now, or $60 in three months. That's actually a pretty tough decision for me haha"
PS4Deals,3a2k3d,ProfessorPoopyPants7,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:38:31 2015 UTC,"You can buy the $80 one any play now or you can buy the physical version of it for the same price and get a bunch of bonus physical stuff (but once again, you wouldn't be able to play until September)"
PS4Deals,3a2k3d,xXSushiSanXx,5,Wed Jun 17 15:02:21 2015 UTC,"As someone who's not played GTA 5 yet, is it still worth playing?  I realize this 'deal' isn't a big savings, but are people still playing the online component?"
PS4Deals,3a2k3d,jjdigitized,6,Tue Jun 16 22:00:09 2015 UTC,If you haven't played it the price is worth the single player alone.

PS4Deals,3a2k3d,99639,2,Tue Jun 16 21:34:25 2015 UTC,Haven't heard about the ps3 version in particular but the pc version of aliens is highly lauded.  I've heard nothing but great things.
PS4Deals,3a2k3d,jcal0032,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:27:13 2015 UTC,"Man.. $24 still seems a little steep for Alien: Isolation.. Opinions,  anyone?"
PS4Deals,3a2k3d,99639,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:33:39 2015 UTC,"It was on the steam sale for pc recently for $12 but they always get better deals.  That said, everyone could not shut up about it.  They said it's the best game of the year for many people and it is so good it transcends genre.  It is a sort of survival, sneaking, fps, but the terror of hiding under a desk while the alien walks by is like nothing else.  Apparently it captures the feel and style of the movies perfectly.  It's not just set in the future, it's set in what a person from the 1980s thinks the future looks like, if that makes sense."

I would've given it a 6.5 or so during the first 10-15 hours, but once I hit the 50 hour mark I was really getting sick of the game.

PS4Deals,3a2vyc,99639,3,Wed Jun 24 21:09:21 2015 UTC,DRIVECLUB™ is all about you and your friends.  Possibly dumb question.  How fun is the game if you don't have friends? Does this have an Armored Core 5 style thing where the game just throws you into a random clan at the start and you can venture out from there?

PS4Deals,3a12b5,m0ei,4,Tue Jun 16 11:50:57 2015 UTC,"When this came out, people made it out to be the RPG to own for new consoles. Now all I see are people who didn't enjoy it, so I don't know if I should get this or not."
PS4Deals,3a12b5,slickestwood,5,Tue Jun 16 18:15:01 2015 UTC,"There are countless people who enjoy the game. It just depends on where you're getting your sample. You wouldn't expect many people who own this game to have even clicked this topic in general.  If you go to the Dragon Age sub, there are thousands who really enjoyed this game."
PS4Deals,3a12b5,GreenSkyFish,3,Tue Jun 16 18:53:54 2015 UTC,"I loved it. Did you like the other Dragon Age games or Mass Effect? Do you enjoy talking to your squad mates and figuring out their stories, helping them on quests and pursuing romances? Do you like to explore the lore behind a game? Do you like RPG mechanics and team based tactics?  Those are all keys. Some of the sidequests are a little bit boring and the world is massive and open (which can be good or bad), but they can be filled out by banter between your squad mates. The overall story is pretty good, but some of the surprises are a lot of cooler if you played the older games. It really comes down to caring about the characters and the world. If you don't, everything will seem monotonous, but if you do the world is filled with a lot of wonder and excitement. I enjoyed the combat, Its not super fluid, but using spells and other abilities from multiple characters is fun and feels satisfying even if the mechanics aren't as sharp as a game like Witcher 3.  Its one of my favorite games of the last 5 years, so I heavily recommend it, but you need to have the  time to invest in it or it might be hard to get into it. The first 5 hours can be a bit boring, especially if you don't realize you need to go back to your home base to progress the story."
PS4Deals,3a12b5,skymind,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:03:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I like Mass Effect but have not gotten too into them yet. I think I could definitely like this game, but will probably wait on it, not because I think it's an unfair price, but I want to be able to invest a lot of hours into it especially at first. The way you describe the gameplay makes me think I will enjoy it, though."
PS4Deals,3a12b5,slickestwood,2,Thu Jun 18 15:11:42 2015 UTC,I agree with m0ei. There was a lot of hype for this game but it just wasn't for me. The gameplay became boring and repetitive almost instantly for me.
PS4Deals,3a12b5,WorkRedditEqualsFun,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:48:23 2015 UTC,"That worries me. If the story is good, I might be able to forgive it somewhat, but the story isn't anything to write home about from what I have heard."

PS4Deals,3a12b5,GEARHEADGus,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:29:14 2015 UTC,"It depends, some really enjoyed it and some didn't. I didn't. The problem is you need to control 4 characters at the same time, spend some time with tactics and other stuff. The environment and the graphics are pretty good but the gameplay was mehhh. You don't have much spells to use, you just spam like 2 sorts of attacks all the time, well I couldn't continue, I got bored. On the other hand, The Witcher: Wild Hunt was my favorite, it never bores you and you control a single character with a much better story, graphics, voices and acting.... I can keep going, but I think what I said is pretty clear. If I had to play with 1 character in Dragon Age: Inquisition like the witcher, with more attacks and a better gameplay, I for sure would have loved it.  One last thing, simply this game isn't for everyone. A lot has enjoyed it."
PS4Deals,3a12b5,slickestwood,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:19:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the main thing keeping me from getting it right now is that I won't touch it in favor of The Witcher. I could definitely see the combat getting old quick if you can just spam a few attacks. I'll probably give it a try once it's $15 or so. Thanks, this is the comment I was looking for."

Best buy price match policy (last paragraph is GCU)  http://www.bestbuy.com/site/help-topics/price-match-guarantee/pcmcat297300050000.c?id=pcmcat297300050000"
PS4Deals,39v7nq,caribou915,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:52:27 2015 UTC,"I can second the fact that, even if it is not their policy, at my best buy they have let me price match multiple games and still allow the GCU discount. It is worth a shot if you have a best buy near you."
PS4Deals,39v7nq,tsquared_,2,Mon Jun 15 20:54:47 2015 UTC,I'm not saying it won't work. I'm saying it's directly against their price match policy so YMMV and don't get upset with managers if they tell you no.
PS4Deals,39v7nq,caribou915,-4,Mon Jun 15 21:03:34 2015 UTC,"It happened at three separate best buys and I know no employees at any of them.  Again, rather than jerk off the same old line, actually go try it and post your results."
PS4Deals,39v7nq,Ellenpaosdirtycooch,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:56:23 2015 UTC,Pretty sure that's what YMMV means. So don't be a dick.
PS4Deals,39v7nq,Brickis,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:55:03 2015 UTC,I'm wondering if the actual sale price ($41.99) can be price matched at Best Buy and then have GCU applied to snag it for ~$35 after tax.
PS4Deals,39v7nq,ishkabibbel2000,2,Mon Jun 15 15:40:11 2015 UTC,Best Buy will price match but won't apply the 20% off on price matched games. I do believe you still get 2x reward points though.
PS4Deals,39v7nq,gopacktennie,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:52:27 2015 UTC,"Just picked it up, thanks a lot!  saved 30 bucks"
PS4Deals,39v7nq,vrabel,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:09:34 2015 UTC,My Target stuck to their policy (as most probably would) and didn't let me stack the deals :(
PS4Deals,39uims,caribou915,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:06:22 2015 UTC,$29.99 now for a new copy. Just price matched it at Walmart for that price.
PS4Deals,39uims,Locksmith_J,-26,Wed Jul 22 00:59:21 2015 UTC,$30+ for an annual sport game? Fuck that horse shit.
PS4Deals,39uims,Locksmith_J,28,Mon Jun 15 11:38:11 2015 UTC,"I apologize for offending you, while trying to post a deal that other people may enjoy. Next time I'll run it by you to make sure you think it is a good deal before posting a game that is less than 3 months old, over 20% off, and in the midst of the MLB season."
PS4Deals,39tjde,KimJungIlyasova,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:10:15 2015 UTC,Deal's over -- back to 50 bucks now.
PS4Deals,39tjde,BeesPhD,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:31:15 2015 UTC,Lucky I picked it up just before the price went up... The game is pretty neat

PS4Deals,39tjde,Soundwave429,5,Mon Jun 15 04:07:42 2015 UTC,I thought this game was suppose to be good. Are you maybe confusing this game with Watch Dogs?
PS4Deals,39tjde,Africanfratboy,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:11:53 2015 UTC,The PS4 port is apparently riddled with bugs that are never going to get fixed. Maybe thats why he made that comment.
PS4Deals,39tjde,433bryan,2,Mon Jun 15 13:16:10 2015 UTC,I platted the game and hardly experienced any bugs except for a hilarious glitch where you stay in slow-motion longer then you should.
PS4Deals,39t01l,Iron_Jesus,16,Sun Jun 14 14:02:36 2015 UTC,It must be to offset the ripoff prices for those games on the lower row.
PS4Deals,39t01l,Ellenpaosdirtycooch,2,Sun Jun 14 14:54:46 2015 UTC,Isn't $60 pretty standard price? I'm pretty sure Target will price match the games too.
PS4Deals,39t01l,tykulton,11,Sun Jun 14 15:04:24 2015 UTC,"Bloodborne, Battlefield, Mortal Kombat, and COD are all around $40 on Amazon right now, so if they'd price match and then take off 25% it'd be great, I just have a feeling they wouldn't do that."
PS4Deals,39t01l,maj6,8,Sun Jun 14 15:24:30 2015 UTC,"They'll let you. Just ask for the price match. Hold the reserve card in your hand. If you can check out with some other stuff. Hand the card to the cashier last. The 25% comes off automatically. The cashier will usually look at the total price bewilderedly. Maybe say something like ""Wow that's weird. That's a good deal."" They won't say anything because they don't care all that much and it's not coming out of thier pay check. Pay. Smile and say thanks. At least that's how it has worked in the past."
PS4Deals,39t01l,dontdonk,4,Sun Jun 14 16:43:37 2015 UTC,Best buy will not price match and take the Gamers Club reward.  Target might.

PS4Deals,39t01l,Ellenpaosdirtycooch,-14,Sun Jun 14 19:02:42 2015 UTC,"Best Buy will if you go to customer service and ask a manager to override. I have done it at three different best buys, regardless of the guy who trolls this sub copy and pasting their policy.  Oh boy the butthurt is strong in your downvote.  Hey guys nice downvotes. So you like it when people don't save money here or what? Instead of jerking off each other, go to best buy and try."
PS4Deals,39t01l,ACARDINAL86,5,Sun Jun 14 17:17:01 2015 UTC,"FYI this ad is a little misleading guys. I just went into Target to preorder BO3 and get 25% off Witcher 3, but apparently Witcher 3 is not possible to be used for this offer. I was told its only select titles but it did seem like most of the popular AAA titles were a part of it like Bloodborne, GTA, MKX etc."
PS4Deals,39t01l,Leeeoon,2,Sun Jun 14 18:41:50 2015 UTC,Yep I went to get 25% off of ESO and I got there and their signs read 25% off of select titles when you preorder but the add says ANY video game. I'm thinking of going and just trying considering the ad is misleading.
PS4Deals,39t01l,jozone11,2,Sun Jun 14 22:05:09 2015 UTC,Is the 25% off a voucher that I can use at anytime or do I immediately have to use it upon preorder?
PS4Deals,39t01l,gardobus,2,Sun Jun 14 15:28:57 2015 UTC,It's in the Target weekly ad which runs til 6/20. So I imagine you have until Saturday to place the preorder and purchase a game for 25% off.
PS4Deals,39t01l,heyenikin,2,Sun Jun 14 15:35:24 2015 UTC,"It wasn't pictured or listed on the ad, so I'm guessing probably not."
PS4Deals,39t01l,gardobus,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:04:53 2015 UTC,So can I just cancel the preorder the next day? I don't want any of those games lol
PS4Deals,39t01l,fire_fox_,6,Sun Jun 14 18:15:02 2015 UTC,I wouldn't worry about it. You're literally paying a dollar to get 25% off something else. I pre-ordered Dead Island 2 for $1 to save 30% on Evil Within and I really don't intend to buy DI2 at Target when it finally comes out.
PS4Deals,39t01l,theblackalbino94,2,Sun Jun 14 17:14:58 2015 UTC,"Lol true, so I'm out a dollar."

PS4Deals,39sdoi,dudeblue25,2,Mon Jun 15 21:55:52 2015 UTC,Thanks for sharing OP! I was able to use a $5 rewards cert and get this for $34.99
PS4Deals,39sdoi,Kyuuma,-6,Sun Jun 14 13:56:44 2015 UTC,I wanted to brag too but didn't. Under $3 a month for a year of ps+ though? No problem.
PS4Deals,39sdoi,Ellenpaosdirtycooch,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:00:07 2015 UTC,Do these expire? I've got about 2 months left on mine right now
PS4Deals,39sdoi,uscman480,2,Sun Jun 14 23:26:20 2015 UTC,It'll stack on those two months to a total of 14 months.

PS4Deals,39sdoi,uscman480,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:18:29 2015 UTC,You'll be fine.  I bought 2 on Black Friday 2013 for $30.  Ended up giving one to a friend last November and it worked.

PS4Deals,39sdoi,Cocoasprinkles,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:31:47 2015 UTC,Does the 1 year PSN subscription ever go on sale for lower than $40?  The lowest I've seen it at was $40.
PS4Deals,39sdoi,username_anon,4,Sun Jun 14 08:50:43 2015 UTC,Back in 2013 it went for like $30.

PS4Deals,39sdoi,Midnightzero,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:40:38 2015 UTC,the lowest ive seen it was 30 but that was 2-3 years ago and has never went below 39 ever since.
PS4Deals,39sdoi,Fucking_Casuals,1 point,Sun Jun 14 09:12:54 2015 UTC,Do these work for renewing subscriptions? Or only for new accounts?
PS4Deals,39sdoi,Fucking_Casuals,4,Sun Jun 14 14:09:47 2015 UTC,"For both. You can stack multiple subscriptions on top of each other. e.g. if your subscription expires 15th August 2015 and you redeem one of these codes, your membership will be extended till 15th of August 2016."
PS4Deals,39sdoi,goddammnick,2,Sun Jun 14 14:40:47 2015 UTC,So I can redeem it today even though my membership doesn't expire until February 2016?
PS4Deals,39sdoi,ralphyb0b,2,Sun Jun 14 15:57:38 2015 UTC,Yes you can. You can buy two and stack them so you will have a membership until 2018.

PS4Deals,39sz2p,fantoman,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:35:10 2015 UTC,Hi! I'm looking to buy a PS4 for my husband for father's day. Do you mean Batman bundles or as in new PS4 model consoles are coming out? If its the bundle then I don't really care--just want to make sure they aren't coming out with a new model of PS4?
PS4Deals,39sz2p,pharmkitten,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:56:07 2015 UTC,The new consoles that come out next tuesday will have Batman packaged with them rather than Last of Us for the same price of $399.99.  The console is the same but is repackaged with a different game.   http://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Console-Free-Remastered-Voucher-4/dp/B00RY3GIDE/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1434552293&sr=8-3&keywords=ps4

PS4Deals,39sz2p,pharmkitten,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:52:34 2015 UTC,I personally would get him the last of us bundle just because it is probably one of the best if not the best game I have ever played.
PS4Deals,39sz2p,Kadenz1,2,Wed Jun 17 16:46:35 2015 UTC,I got this like two weeks ago and it works on their bundles too. Pretty good savings.
PS4Deals,39sz2p,Da_Oreo_King,2,Mon Jun 15 03:38:47 2015 UTC,"Man, if the new consoles show up this week this will be a sweet deal."

PS4Deals,39r2w0,wobel85,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:15:46 2015 UTC,Code is dead. Still $74.99

PS4Deals,39opbx,Nawara_Ven,3,Sat Jun 13 14:35:16 2015 UTC,I think the PSN is just trying to be more competitive with steam. Especially now that the summer steam sale is on.
PS4Deals,39opbx,LamesMcGee,3,Sat Jun 13 19:34:36 2015 UTC,Worth it?
PS4Deals,39opbx,mylittleandy,3,Sat Jun 13 15:46:32 2015 UTC,"For that price, without a doubt."
PS4Deals,39opbx,lebronjamess,2,Sat Jun 13 15:49:17 2015 UTC,"Cool, I'll get it later. God I'm going broke. All these steam sales psn sales jeez where will I find the time?"

PS4Deals,39opbx,OriginalUneeK,3,Sat Jun 13 18:54:14 2015 UTC,Decent price but it has been as low as $6 before on a PSN flash sale. That's what I snagged it at.
PS4Deals,39opbx,MFTWrecks,2,Sun Jun 14 15:07:47 2015 UTC,As is Sleeping Dogs Definitive Edition. It's for fifteen dollars. Picked them both up.

PS4Deals,39lofv,kotogo,3,Sat Jun 13 19:32:04 2015 UTC,"If you have a group of friends to play with, absolutely. If you're thinking about playing online against random opponents you may run into some pretty tough competition. One or two mistakes against a skilled player can quickly end up costing you the round.  Mortal Kombat's story mode is really entertaining compared to other fighters, but you'll be able to play it to completion in about 5 hours or so."

PS4Deals,39li8y,Leonyoung8,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:21:54 2015 UTC,If you live near a best buy you can check if they have them in stock (which they probably do)
PS4Deals,39li8y,elmntdark,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:55:59 2015 UTC,They got none all over the Vancouver area. Completely sold out locally + online. :(  Edit: but then again it seems like the deal runs for 6 more days. So possibly there is more stock...
PS4Deals,39li8y,Leonyoung8,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:08:18 2015 UTC,"Damn that sucks. Did you try calling the individual stores? The store in my city didn't show whether it was in stock or not online, but when I called there was some in stock"
PS4Deals,39li8y,elmntdark,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:50:38 2015 UTC,I just did a price match at Walmart in the new west location. They accepted it. I just printed out the best buy ad. Main thing they wanted to know was if it was an online-only deal or in store as well. They didn't care that best buy was out of stock. Sweet purchase !!!!  Two left at this location btw. For any local vancouver ppl
PS4Deals,39li8y,beepxd,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:45:10 2015 UTC,I just picked one up this afternoon at the Robson and Granville (Old FS) location. Didn't ask how many they have left though..

I never got the item I ordered and ended up having to dispute it with my CC company. I am very easy going when it comes to shipping speed, but it was a full 3 months for a small household item. YMMV, but their customer support was extremely terrible. They actually told me to dispute it because they refused to issue a refund. If anyone tries this and it works, let me know. I'm curious if it was just a fluke, or if it's an on going issue with this company."
PS4Deals,39fv1h,8_Bit_Armada,9,Thu Jun 11 14:51:30 2015 UTC,Yeah I've heard mostly negative experiences about them. $10 is a cool discount but it doesn't seem to be worth the risk.
PS4Deals,39fv1h,crossower,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:02:35 2015 UTC,That deal comes once in a while on more reputable vendors (like eBay) so I'd just wait for that.

PS4Deals,39fv1h,crossower,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:57:51 2015 UTC,Ordered a controller  few weeks ago with VISA promo and it came earlier than expected in a perfect condition. I was worried as well because they seem to have bad reputation.

PS4Deals,39fv1h,Scum_Of-The_Earth,3,Thu Jun 11 15:58:52 2015 UTC,This website has a pretty bad reputation across most subreddits. Just a friendly warning.
PS4Deals,39fv1h,ayOitztuan,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:47:19 2015 UTC,shouldn't be banned across all those subreddits ?   already there is one guy in this thread saying the code doesn't work.

PS4Deals,39fv1h,halfdogjury,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:41:53 2015 UTC,PS+ memberships usually show up on Black Friday at $29.99. Or they did 2 years ago. I'd load up when another $29.99 comes along.

PS4Deals,39bwpn,Pigley_II,5,Wed Jun 10 18:49:28 2015 UTC,TOTALLY worth it.
PS4Deals,39bwpn,cl0007,2,Thu Jun 11 01:48:54 2015 UTC,Woah! This is a steal! I might have to buy it
PS4Deals,39bwpn,TacoKingBean,5,Wed Jun 10 22:05:08 2015 UTC,I bought it for 54 bucks and still play it and I'm doing every mission. This game is amazing. This is really a steal
PS4Deals,39bwpn,lapride50,3,Wed Jun 10 23:49:56 2015 UTC,"Do it! Not only does this game have a great single player, but it's also couch co-op; something very rare these days."

PS4Deals,39b2pk,Lalocheziation,2,Wed Jun 10 17:31:53 2015 UTC,Pretty well. I remote play a lot. R2 & L2 become r1 & l2 respectively. I wouldn't try to do a dungeon or anything like that. Just personal preference.

PS4Deals,39b2pk,halfdogjury,2,Thu Jun 11 13:13:54 2015 UTC,"Absolutely worth it. I bought it when I first got my PS4 last summer and played all the way to level 25 or so. At the time I couldn't afford the sub fee, and now I don't have the time to sink into an MMO. However, this game is gorgeous and rich with content. Plus the expansion is coming soon."

PS4Deals,39bn79,Westlund,3,Thu Jun 11 03:27:31 2015 UTC,Sorry for being dumb and lazy but I've googled this a few times and don't really get it.  I have a PS4 but no vita or PS3.  Can I buy digital versions of PS3 games and play directly from this?  There's a few JRPGs I missed that I wouldn't mind dropping $40 to be able to play.
PS4Deals,39bn79,eyedialect,2,Thu Jun 11 18:16:48 2015 UTC,"Only 13 games can be played with remote play from the PS3 to Vita/PSTV, the list is here. But you would have to have a ps3. With the PSTV you could play digital and physical Vita games or remote play from the PS4 to the PSTV."

PS4Deals,39bn79,youdonotnome,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:38:32 2015 UTC,"i just got one in hopes of using it to stream the PS4 to my bedroom.  but even after hardwiring it in with ethernet, the lag renders the games completely unplayable.  my internet connection is 160mbps download on speedtest but the PS4 and PSTV max out at like 30mbps even hardwired in.  if you plan to play the PS4 in multiple rooms, you're better off with a multizone receiver and running HDMI to the second room, since you'll be running ethernet anyway with the PSTV"

PS4Deals,3976e7,mrtitkins,4,Wed Jun 10 02:44:05 2015 UTC,Black flag is a solid 50 hours of fun. I would recommend getting it for under 20.
PS4Deals,3976e7,Mattrosexual,3,Wed Jun 10 01:58:48 2015 UTC,I'm surprised that Red Dead Redemption is $18 for a used version. I think I bought mine for less than $10 at Gamestop.

PS4Deals,396zs7,Gloomyghoul,6,Tue Jun 9 19:19:17 2015 UTC,Every PS4 owner should have one of these...at least until they improve the DS4 battery life.

PS4Deals,396zs7,mark502,5,Wed Jun 10 01:48:24 2015 UTC,Not one? Not even a single letter?
PS4Deals,396zs7,Skelltor95,3,Wed Jun 10 22:06:39 2015 UTC,I bought one of these when the last deal came around. It has literally made my gaming life with the ps4 so much better. One feature I really like is that to charge you have to push down on the controller and it clicks into place on the stand. One of the better purchases I've made this year. Highly recommended.
PS4Deals,396zs7,jcrockerman,2,Wed Jun 10 11:30:20 2015 UTC,Can also price match at best buy if you dont want to wait or pay shipping

PS4Deals,3978xm,molcomtitman,2,Wed Jun 10 00:10:45 2015 UTC,Great price and a great game
PS4Deals,3978xm,Jmccu7r,2,Wed Jun 10 04:28:34 2015 UTC,Worked great. Thanks. Looking forward to gettin in on the action.
PS4Deals,396dsd,DreadMcLaren,3,Tue Jun 9 16:08:52 2015 UTC,Also available at Walmart for the same price:  http://www.walmart.com/ip/Sony-Dualshock-4-Controller-Urban-Camo-PS4-PlayStation-4/38456905
PS4Deals,396dsd,proud_statist,2,Tue Jun 9 16:09:43 2015 UTC,Walmart will price match their online price in store; I saved 5 bucks on shipping this way.
PS4Deals,396dsd,cash-only,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:24:38 2015 UTC,"Apparently not all locations of Walmart will price match walmart.com, which makes no sense to me.  Ship to store is free though, and you can pick it up there"

PS4Deals,395ozl,Danger-Cl0se,2,Wed Jun 10 05:22:19 2015 UTC,Is there any better deal than this? The taxes brings it back up to $370+.
PS4Deals,395ozl,amxn,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:20:27 2015 UTC,"This is the best deal I've seen in a while, but not the best. If you're dying to get a ps4, then this is worth it. if you can wait months, then something better should come up within a couple months"
PS4Deals,3950hd,mikern,3,Tue Jun 9 08:27:39 2015 UTC,Do they ship to other European countries?
PS4Deals,3950hd,gekko201,6,Tue Jun 9 09:48:43 2015 UTC,Nope ;(
PS4Deals,3950hd,H3000,13,Tue Jun 9 09:52:18 2015 UTC,Well then I'm adding Norway to my blacklist.

PS4Deals,3950hd,Shimfs,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:08:14 2015 UTC,Noooo. Same company has stores in Denmark. Yet they charge the normal full price
PS4Deals,3950hd,ninetwozero,2,Tue Jun 9 17:19:04 2015 UTC,Their Swedish branch does that too. We've got Call of Duty: AW this week. ☺

PS4Deals,39378m,Univarn,8,Mon Jun 8 22:48:32 2015 UTC,These prices are pretty bad considering they are all pre-owned.
PS4Deals,39378m,pr0adam,-3,Mon Jun 8 23:49:48 2015 UTC,"Not really, especially compared to GameStop."
PS4Deals,39378m,FelBanana17,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:21:50 2015 UTC,Well from what I'm seeing from the first couple of pages these are standard prices on amazon. Or  right now discounted new
PS4Deals,39378m,pr0adam,2,Tue Jun 9 00:24:52 2015 UTC,I have been pretty unimpressed with pre-owned prices everywhere being about on part with new but if they are comparable and I can get  one free I'll risk it.
PS4Deals,39378m,bholzi88,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:42:00 2015 UTC,"True. I would be utilizing this for 3ds, though, so not much risk in pre-owned cartridges XD"

PS4Deals,392g9r,mperez19,2,Mon Jun 8 19:42:32 2015 UTC,Just did this at Best Buy. Didn't verify it at all 😎
PS4Deals,392g9r,illadope,2,Tue Jun 9 02:48:02 2015 UTC,Anyone know if I can price match this at BestBuy?
PS4Deals,392g9r,Shadowlink_1990,2,Mon Jun 8 22:51:18 2015 UTC,You can.  However if you have GCU they usually don't stack price match and that.
PS4Deals,392g9r,_CW,2,Mon Jun 8 23:00:37 2015 UTC,Cool. I just went to get it done. It was worth it to get my points though at least. Thanks for the info!
PS4Deals,392g9r,Shadowlink_1990,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:31:09 2015 UTC,Awesome! Been meaning to pick this up for a while. Interesting to see how I perform back on Dark Souls after having gotten so used to Bloodborne's combat.
PS4Deals,392g9r,fuzzbunny21,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:19:02 2015 UTC,Is it solid for $42?
PS4Deals,392g9r,dzordzyk,2,Tue Jun 9 03:18:42 2015 UTC,Definitely worth it.
PS4Deals,392g9r,teamtebow,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:39:30 2015 UTC,Yeah I have put hours in it and would still buy it at full price
PS4Deals,392g9r,GreatP3nguin,0,Tue Jun 9 07:13:16 2015 UTC,Would pricematch work in a Canadian bestbuy?
PS4Deals,393doh,pelap,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:37:04 2015 UTC,"Worked great for me. I had to confirm my account using my cell phone, and had to wait a few hours before the game was available after entering the code. Don't know why that was."

PS4Deals,390vmh,fantoman,3,Mon Jun 8 16:10:29 2015 UTC,"I had to pull the trigger on this. I'm not spending $85. I'm saving $15. Yeah. Yeah, that's how I'm gonna justify this.   Edit: wait a minute.. I put in the coupon code and it said it was $85 but it still charged my PayPal $100? What's the deal here?   Edit 2: ok nevermind.. it just takes a minute to register I guess. PayPal is now showing -$85 instead of -$100. All is well with the world."
PS4Deals,390vmh,shall_2,3,Tue Jun 9 01:35:49 2015 UTC,"I wish there were more digital deals. It's a digital currency, why not just send codes?"
PS4Deals,390vmh,Shindo989,4,Mon Jun 8 17:01:12 2015 UTC,"Because it's against ebay's policy. Also, people can just put in a dispute with PayPal and get their money back with a chargeback. Harder to say you didn't get the goods when there's a tracking code from the post office saying it's been delivered."
PS4Deals,390vmh,ImThatGuyYouDontKnow,2,Mon Jun 8 18:19:09 2015 UTC,"I wasnt talking about on ebay, more just in general"

PS4Deals,38wp93,AngrySandyVag,3,Sun Jun 7 20:51:55 2015 UTC,The tag at my target listed it as on sale for 49.99 from 06/07-06/13.  I had them price match the web site at customer service and got the 41.99 price.  Not sure if the dates applied to the 49 or 41 price.
PS4Deals,38wp93,Pavingmantis,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:18:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm guessing this deal will be shorter since it's by far the lowest we've seen, but I'll still let them know."
PS4Deals,38wp93,AngrySandyVag,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:19:27 2015 UTC,"Same for me. In the electronics department I showed him the price via their website, and he changed right on the spot, no customer service needed. I'm honestly thinking this might've been an error on targets part as both xb1 and ps4 were going for 49.99"

PS4Deals,38wp93,ET3RNA4,15,Sun Jun 7 16:12:21 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, it's worth a full price ($60), so for $42 even bigger YES."
PS4Deals,38wp93,dzordzyk,2,Sun Jun 7 16:17:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the quick reply, what if I've never played the previous games?"
PS4Deals,38wp93,ET3RNA4,3,Sun Jun 7 16:27:55 2015 UTC,You'll be fine. I haven't either but am really enjoying it.
PS4Deals,38wp93,JahWeir,3,Sun Jun 7 16:36:03 2015 UTC,"Awesome. Thanks guys. Just bought it, total came out to $34.27"
PS4Deals,38wp93,ET3RNA4,5,Sun Jun 7 17:13:36 2015 UTC,This game is probably the best RPG I've ever played. Enjoy it dude!
PS4Deals,38wp93,Avagantamos6,3,Sun Jun 7 17:50:18 2015 UTC,"That's a real sweet deal for a brand new game! I've heard there are branching story paths, so if you replay the game with different choices along the way, you're looking at 150-200 hours of gameplay.   Edit: FYI at 150 hours you only spend 22 cents per hour for your fun. Wooooo"

PS4Deals,38wp93,DMS0205,3,Sun Jun 7 21:02:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, I picked it up today and they matched it.  But only if available in Target store in your location.  When I went to checkout ,the girl at register did not even care if it was available in store near by.  These type of things all depend on the person."

PS4Deals,38wp93,love_fist_,1 point,Mon Jun 8 11:10:25 2015 UTC,Does BestBuy GCU stack with this price?
PS4Deals,38wp93,J0hnnyArs0n,3,Mon Jun 8 11:56:05 2015 UTC,From my experience you only get one: price match or GCU.
PS4Deals,38wp93,Nadaf1nga,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:39:00 2015 UTC,"Yep, and it's all done by the computer. When they enter the price match into the computer, it nullifies the GCU discount."

PS4Deals,38wp93,TacoKingBean,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:34:32 2015 UTC,Haven't played any of the series. Still worth buying?
PS4Deals,38wp93,bitbytebeep,2,Mon Jun 8 04:24:45 2015 UTC,"Resoundingly yes. The Witcher series is a breath of fresh air for western RPGs. CDProjekt is a small-time developer so you don't have that crushing corporate greed thing going on with DLC.  I played 1 and 2, and it wasn't that punishing if you didn't know anything about the lore or characters. I think it does help build a richer world if you play the other two though. Witcher 1 hasn't aged that well IMO unless there are modders working on it."

PS4Deals,38wp93,WINSTON913,2,Tue Jun 9 17:34:10 2015 UTC,Don't the stores buy the games and then resell them? Wouldn't target be at a loss in profit and not cdpr? Serious.

PS4Deals,38xyba,ScubaSteve1219,2,Mon Jun 8 11:28:10 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I bought it for $16, sold it for about the same and still regret it. Maybe you'll enjoy it, maybe, but there wasn't a single fun moment for me. It's just lame mission after lame mission packed with insta-fail stealth, awful driving missions where you're forced to bump into the fleeing car because there's no other consistent way to attack, a sterile and boring game-world, no interesting characters, awful music, and a rinse/repeat gameplay structure of check map, set waypoint, kill bad guy.  And the hacking system is such a lame way to make it playable. Instead of actually exploring the world for yourself, poking and prodding to learn its secrets, there's this ever-present camera network. The developers obviously fell back on it instead of intelligently, creatively designing the environments and enemy encounters. It's one of the biggest reasons the game feels like a cheesy theme-park exhibit where you have no participation other than walking through.  It's just so damn boring. And I'm honestly not one of those people who can only play super gamey games. I love cinematic games; TLOU might be my all-time favorite. Journey is a masterpiece. But Watch Dogs? It's an absolute piece of garbage and a dangerous, McDonald's sort of direction that I pray games will never take."
PS4Deals,38xyba,Fjdijtsk,2,Mon Jun 8 13:50:45 2015 UTC,you may have convinced me to not buy it. gotta save all i can for Guitar Hero anyway.

PS4Deals,38xyba,Addfwyn,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:19:21 2015 UTC,yes because that deal is through the microsoft store itself. But from what I read about this game it seems to make more sense to get it physically to beat it and sell it for whatever you can get for it

Take it to the customer service table to trade in and they will double check to make sure it is working. After that, they give you the gift card and the coupon.

PS4Deals,38r57k,bobbyweiser,2,Sat Jun 6 17:17:36 2015 UTC,You press down and they click in to place. You will know they are locked in because the light bar will glow yellow. When they are done charging the light bar shuts off. You then press down again to unlock it in and then you're ready to play. It's the best ps4 accessory I own!

PS4Deals,38r57k,virtigo31,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:11:25 2015 UTC,I've been using this for about 6 months and have never had a problem. I usually keep my PS4 in rest mode with both controllers on it and haven't experienced any issues.
PS4Deals,38ol0b,grbthk,3,Fri Jun 5 15:51:07 2015 UTC,are they any good? I'm really considering buying this. Or should I just save a little more for the Gold headset?
PS4Deals,38ol0b,Oka_Nieba,8,Fri Jun 5 18:48:37 2015 UTC,save. turtle beaches are the beats of gaming headphones
PS4Deals,38ol0b,battlefield645,3,Fri Jun 5 18:53:06 2015 UTC,I don't know if I agree with that. I've had a great experience with mine
PS4Deals,38ol0b,Westlund,2,Fri Jun 5 19:36:48 2015 UTC,I has 2 headsets by them  and both broke with me taking extreme care of them.
PS4Deals,38ol0b,battlefield645,2,Fri Jun 5 20:09:25 2015 UTC,"Disappointing. I remember back in the day when EVERYONE wanted a turtle beach, and there was only two models. I wish i kept on to my original just for nostalgia sake."
PS4Deals,38ol0b,SylvesterLundgren,2,Fri Jun 5 19:09:21 2015 UTC,"I used to have a pair back in the mw2 days. But now they just are cheap headphones with a ""gaming price""."
PS4Deals,38ol0b,battlefield645,-2,Fri Jun 5 20:08:21 2015 UTC,And next you´re going to say the Sony ones are better - let me break it to you: The sony ones are made by turtle beach just without noise cancelling which is annoying as fuck.
PS4Deals,38ol0b,wohlstand,2,Fri Jun 5 21:04:54 2015 UTC,noise cancelling headphones always give me weird feelings of pressure around my ears.  maybe I'm just sensitive to it.  i have ear problems on flights too
PS4Deals,38ol0b,littlebrwnrobot,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:04:16 2015 UTC,Didn't know that. I just know that turtle beaches are really easy to break lol I had some Sony ones and they worked great for me.
PS4Deals,38ol0b,battlefield645,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:11:35 2015 UTC,"Being unschooled in regards to this, I would ask if maybe you can shoot me a few recommendations. Looking for mid-range as far as price, if you would be so kind."
PS4Deals,38ol0b,RudyBagels,2,Fri Jun 5 19:40:46 2015 UTC,Headphone wise I would go with the Playstation headsets that have the 3d stereo. Basically the gold and elite pulse ones I think? Right now you could just be good with a regular set of ear buds for cheap and have the same experience.
PS4Deals,38ol0b,battlefield645,4,Fri Jun 5 20:11:08 2015 UTC,Thanks internet stranger! I was eyeing those but would have pulled the trigger on Turtle Beach ones until you said that. I really appreciate your input.
PS4Deals,38ol0b,RudyBagels,-2,Fri Jun 5 20:51:52 2015 UTC,"Don´t trust random people on the internet. The original turtle beaches are generally better than the Sony ones - which are just branded, generic ones, that Turtle Beach manufacteurs and brands for Sony. But lacking certain amazing features like noise cancel."
PS4Deals,38ol0b,wohlstand,2,Fri Jun 5 21:06:38 2015 UTC,Maybe you're right but it doesn't hurt to gather opinions. Thanks for your input as well.
PS4Deals,38ol0b,RudyBagels,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:33:16 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but this is a blanket statement that doesn't work. I've had two pairs of P11s and I currently have the X-Ray, which is a CoD-skinned XP400. I agree with you that TB's lower tier headsets blow ass. They aren't durable and I had issues with the cords fraying and breaking (that's why I had 2 pairs of P11s). The first pair were still under warranty, but the second weren't when they broke.  Anyway, I spent days researching what kind of headset I should get next. I looked at Astro A40s and A50s. I looked at Tritton's. I looked at Logitech. I literally tried to avoid Turtle Beach like it was the plague because I was so fed up with the cords breaking. I scoured reviews looking specifically for the problems with all the headsets out there in the market. Trittons are known to break apart and Astros have been called flimsy. Those aren't qualities I trust, even though I take exceptional care of my belongings. Nevertheless, after doing my research, I ended up with the X-Ray headset. The price is what put it over the top for me. It's a MSRP $200 headset I got for $100. It's got pleather ear cups, dolby digital surround sound, is wireless, and can operate as a dual-channel headset. Good luck finding those features for $100. The sound quality is very good. The mic quality could be a bit better, but it's clear. $100 for a dual channel wireless headset is about as good as it gets unless you're about to drop $300+"
PS4Deals,38ol0b,Wood_Ape,1 point,Sat Jun 6 02:47:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah tho to be fair I do have the x-ray (got them for just 60 instead of 200, they are in HUGE sales sometimes) and they did break. I think it´s related to the constant pressure these headsets have from your head, lol sounds kinda weird. But that probably makes them snap kinda easy even if you take care of them.I agree with everything you said tho, they are amazing. And the newer ones seem to have a even better build quality."
PS4Deals,38ol0b,wohlstand,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:53:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I feel you on the durability. Mine definitely have a crack in the plastic just above the ear cups and I suspect that's what you're talking about. Unfortunately, durability is just something that companies in the game today don't want to bother with because it means less product turnover.  I forgot to add, though, I've been very happy with the amount of time a charge is held and the amount of time it takes to fully charge the batteries. I'm getting a solid 7-8 hours out of them, using them daily for 2+ years now, and they still maintain their charge."
PS4Deals,38ol0b,Wood_Ape,1 point,Sat Jun 6 05:41:51 2015 UTC,They break like in 6 months even if you take good care of them
PS4Deals,38ol0b,Lugio_,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:06:44 2015 UTC,Yeah man but same can be said for the sony branded ones. Tho not sure if that´s because they are really by TB too. I think most if not all headsets have huge chance of breaking :(

PS4Deals,38ol0b,littlebrwnrobot,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:05:41 2015 UTC,"I've had a few pair over the years. Both broke near the swivel part on the side. But both were accidental drops. Sounds quality is great. Super long cord. Can't recommend enough, especially for this price."

Do I have to leave my PS4 on at home or can it be in rest mode?"
PS4Deals,38jpq7,demoux,4,Thu Jun 4 21:01:50 2015 UTC,"""Streaming PS4 games"" means it broadcast the video feed to the device and sends the button presses back to the system, it means what you're doing on the device its streaming to is whats happening on the actual PS4  This means that you and your wife can't play 2 different games using the same PS4  You could in theory do remote play while away from home, you'd need pretty amazing internet though  It seems the intended purpose of streaming is more ""my ps4 is in the living room but my wife is watching TV right now, so I'll stream to my Vita/VitaTV in this other room""  I've never streamed to a Vita TV but I have streamed to a Vita, it does it pretty good but games that rely on fast timing of button presses suffer (since there'll probably be a half second to second delay)  As a note though, the Vita TV does play a large number of Vita games too, so if youre looking for a device to play some PS1 games off PSN or some JRPGs, this is a good investment (and I highly recommend Persona 4 Golden as well as Danganronpa)"

But someone else cannot use the PS4 at the same time. Still nice if your wife wants to watch TV or something though.  You can stream games over the internet from a hotel or where ever you are as long as the connection is fast enough. There is some lag though, so slower paced games are usually better. Dragon Age would probably work OK. In Quacamelee it might be hard to time some of those jumps.   You can leave the PS4 in rest mode."

PS4Deals,38jpq7,CaptNemo131,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:09:18 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you want it for. If you want it for PS4 streaming, not worth it. The streaming is a cool feature, but any games that require any sort of timing based actions (fps, sports games, etc...) expect a good .5 -1 second delay. If you want to play vita games on TV or want to download older games and don't have a ps4, then i think it is. However, the games aren't overly cheap. Check the Playstation network for pricing."

PS4Deals,38iceb,Westlund,4,Thu Jun 4 15:43:32 2015 UTC,"You don't need to create an account on Pricezombie either. Enter your email address in the watchlist, same as camel.  Also, What if the price dropped on target, bestbuy, kmart, etc? You wouldn't know. Limiting yourself to Amazon is limiting your odds of knowing of a sale. That's why PriceZombie indexes many stores and combines the products so you can comparison shop between them."
PS4Deals,38iceb,mysql101,3,Thu Jun 4 17:35:08 2015 UTC,Pricezombie doesn't show that target has GTA V on PS4 for $50 right now. Does PriceZombie remain current all the time or does it do refresh searched every once in a while?
PS4Deals,38iceb,mysql101,2,Thu Jun 4 18:26:25 2015 UTC,"Here's Target's page.  PZ shows it at the same price.  I'll have to check why it thinks the data isn't fresh (hence the strike through).  Prices are never going to be ""current"" at all times, as the only way to fetch the prices is to poll it. I go into some detail on how price tracking works in this thread, if you're interested."
PS4Deals,38iceb,skyr0n,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:07:12 2015 UTC,"BTW, I checked and the scheduler wasn't updating Target as often as it should have. It should be better now. Thanks!"
PS4Deals,38iceb,TheStapes,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:40:32 2015 UTC,Is the story any good for this FPS? I'm not into the whole CoD/Battlefield genre but loved the new Wolfenstein game.
PS4Deals,38iceb,coltsmetsfan614,4,Thu Jun 4 22:47:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's based on a Russian novel much like The Witcher games are based on a series of Polish novels.  If you do decide to play this, change the dialogue to Russian and turn subtitles on. Much better experience."
PS4Deals,38iceb,dfrazier81,2,Thu Jun 4 23:43:22 2015 UTC,I can't say I've ever played a game with primary language that isn't English. I'll definitely give it a shot!

PS4Deals,38iy8o,IrishTheHobbit,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:06:13 2015 UTC,Yeah. Good site if you know for sure the absolute max you'd pay for a game; but what if it's $1 more? You'd probably still want to know about it. You can't replace r/ps4deals; you can only supplement it.
PS4Deals,38i4ee,luv1138,3,Thu Jun 4 10:58:24 2015 UTC,Such an awesome game
PS4Deals,38i4ee,bossman-CT,2,Thu Jun 4 17:07:23 2015 UTC,$12 after GCU?  That might be decent to pick up for the kiddos.

PS4Deals,38i4ee,AlonzoMoseley,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:23:29 2015 UTC,Pre-owned it's $12.99
PS4Deals,38i4ee,pr0adam,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:59:57 2015 UTC,"Hmm, tempting. But could this be headed to IGC soon? I've always held off because I was pissed at myself for missing out when everyone else got it for free, but I'd love to play it."
PS4Deals,38i4ee,MFTWrecks,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:33:17 2015 UTC,"maybe, but also maybe not since as you said they already gave it for free. if anything itd probably be closer to the end of the year when #2 is going to be closer to coming out"
PS4Deals,38i4ee,pr0adam,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:25:21 2015 UTC,"Sony didn't give it out, though. EA did. So maybe Sony would still put it in the IGC."
PS4Deals,38i4ee,pr0adam,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:09:53 2015 UTC,Thats true. But I still wouldnt count on it. But who knows
PS4Deals,38iyhs,IrishTheHobbit,8,Thu Jun 4 15:07:59 2015 UTC,Wow this game got cheap relatively fast. Still waiting for dying light sale around 30$
PS4Deals,38iyhs,baldingbrah,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:37:18 2015 UTC,Check Ebay. LOTS of Dying Light copies for $30
PS4Deals,38iyhs,Kylestache,2,Fri Jun 5 14:18:48 2015 UTC,"I'll say it again, still too much."
PS4Deals,38iyhs,dewittism,3,Thu Jun 4 17:39:42 2015 UTC,"Id have to disagree. If you have a group to play with it's worth $60. ~$20 is a steal. Then again, I judge games on how much fun I have with them, not the amount of content."
PS4Deals,38iyhs,1on1withthegreat1,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:40:21 2015 UTC,"I agree. A lot of hate gets thrown around toward this game because of their DLC practices. It's a great game and at this price, a steal."

PS4Deals,38fnhi,hoffmanbrm,5,Wed Jun 3 22:12:45 2015 UTC,"It is also $19.99 at Target, and BB will price match. Happy Gaming!"
PS4Deals,38fnhi,wohlstand,4,Wed Jun 3 22:13:21 2015 UTC,So when you click on digital the $19.99 turns into $59.99 lols...
PS4Deals,38fnhi,boogieman117,2,Thu Jun 4 10:00:23 2015 UTC,I saw that as well. I will never understand it. The only thing I can think of is that digital is always available and physical takes up shelf space and needs to be sold off quickly and cheaply in order to make room for the next game.

PS4Deals,38fnhi,ChicagoZephyrs,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:00:54 2015 UTC,This game still has the best FPS mechanics i've seen. I still play it from time to time.
PS4Deals,38fnhi,Reptardar,-19,Sat Jun 6 23:41:58 2015 UTC,Still not worth it..
PS4Deals,38fnhi,BamaFan87,-21,Thu Jun 4 02:15:21 2015 UTC,Nope. Wouldn't even pay $5 for that crap.
PS4Deals,38fnhi,birdplanesuperman,21,Thu Jun 4 06:03:33 2015 UTC,"Why would you even comment? If it's not your type of game, you don't have to play it but I have put over 1000 hours into it. At 20 dollars it's great, expansions are another 40 on the other hand."
PS4Deals,38fnhi,OneLuckyContestant,15,Wed Jun 3 23:12:59 2015 UTC,Mindlessly slamming Destiny is usually good for easy upvotes on some subs. I'm glad to see this sub doesn't put up with it.
PS4Deals,38fnhi,Westlund,2,Wed Jun 3 23:20:47 2015 UTC,I'm level 25 and have hit a wall. Nothing left to do and leveling takes forever without the DLCs. $40 bucks is pretty steep for DLC but if I want to keep playing this game I'm going to have to decide if I should get it or not. Recommend it? Pros/cons of them?
PS4Deals,38fnhi,Bdoggy88,8,Wed Jun 3 23:52:20 2015 UTC,Run strikes. Go to /r/fireteams and run VoG normal mode. Get marks and buy vanguard gear. There is no 25 wall in this game.
PS4Deals,38fnhi,boogieman117,3,Thu Jun 4 02:12:19 2015 UTC,"Can second this. The post-House of Wolves patch allows for the Vanguard armor to level up to 32, the pre-HoW cap and can easily walk the game with no DLC's."
PS4Deals,38fnhi,keeganzero,5,Thu Jun 4 02:58:33 2015 UTC,Good thing no one is forcing you to buy it right?
PS4Deals,389zgl,GetVladimir,14,Tue Jun 2 21:15:42 2015 UTC,"What happened to PSN+? These aren't terrible games, but they've gone from boasting many great retail games to handing out digital only games. It's like going from a full size candy bar to fun size. Sure, it's still candy, but you were just giving out the good stuff."
PS4Deals,389zgl,ClassicalUrine,12,Wed Jun 3 01:37:47 2015 UTC,"PS+ games are very obscure these days (for me anyways), but remember that they'll only improve in time, akin to the PS3. I'm sure these next 2 summer months will have larger games like DriveClub & Knack/Killzone."
PS4Deals,389zgl,Max_Character_Limit-,5,Wed Jun 3 02:47:54 2015 UTC,PS3 went from 3 full aaa-titles (that used to be $60 each) to now like an ind game or two. So why would this make you think ps4 is going to improve?
PS4Deals,389zgl,wohlstand,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:21:48 2015 UTC,"Right, and I'm sure it will but isn't it funny how this is yet another example of how early adopters of consoles are shafted? Pay more, get less out of it."
PS4Deals,389zgl,ClassicalUrine,2,Wed Jun 3 03:29:56 2015 UTC,"It's a trade-off and definitely a tough decision to make. Sure, we get these obscure PS+ games and primitive consoles (better PS4 models coming soon), but we also get to play the better version of cross-gen games which is a significant advantage."

PS4Deals,389zgl,acorsicanpimp,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:10:42 2015 UTC,"Are you serious? If you've had ps+ since ps4 launch you've gotten over $1500 worth of games. Maybe even $2000 by now. Great games in there like Ground Zeroes, Don't Starve, Olli Olli 2, Apotheon, Rogue Legacy, Mercenary Kings, and even Injustice was pretty fun. These are just the ones I really like, people will chime in with Fez, Trine, Transistor, Resogun, and others."
PS4Deals,389zgl,acorsicanpimp,0,Wed Jun 3 19:08:23 2015 UTC,Using a dollar amount is missing the point of what I'm saying. Also don't understand the hostility either.
PS4Deals,389zgl,ClassicalUrine,-6,Wed Jun 3 19:54:52 2015 UTC,"No, it shows how you ""pay more"" i.e. the same ps+ subscription price and you in one year get $1500 worth of games, with average ratings of 7.5/8 out of 10, great enough, then you get some real winners and real losers.   You don't get my hostility? I don't get your stupidity."
PS4Deals,389zgl,acorsicanpimp,-1,Wed Jun 3 20:20:43 2015 UTC,I think you're the idiot if you think all that matters is a sliding scale of video game ratings and total dollar amounts. And judging by your comment history you're a troll anyway.  /enddiscussion
PS4Deals,389zgl,ClassicalUrine,-6,Wed Jun 3 20:41:32 2015 UTC,Oh wow le typical redditor has nothing to say so he makes a call to user history that hurts his feelings. And to get me brigaded. Piss off.
PS4Deals,389zgl,acorsicanpimp,4,Wed Jun 3 20:50:01 2015 UTC,haha i had a laugh at your responses. i don't the idiocy either. they're complaining about the lack of AAA ($60) games but then tell you it's not about the ratings or dollar amounts. wtf? what is it about then?
PS4Deals,389zgl,alt_sense,-1,Thu Jun 4 23:52:02 2015 UTC,"It was impossible to rationalize with that guy. Of course it's about how good the games are, but he was trying to use (most likely) IGN's rating scale where 7.5 is basically ""meh"" as his argument. And saying $15 x 100 digital games = $1500 which doesn't mean it's necessarily a good value. That's really all I meant."
PS4Deals,389zgl,ClassicalUrine,3,Fri Jun 5 19:16:20 2015 UTC,Same except you need it to play online :(
PS4Deals,389zgl,wohlstand,2,Wed Jun 3 10:54:35 2015 UTC,The good stuff will come. PS3 PS+ was mostly not good at all for the first 18 months. I have faith that PS4's PS+ offerings will be awesome soon enough.
PS4Deals,389zgl,Human_Sack,2,Wed Jun 3 14:22:25 2015 UTC,I hope you guys responding are right. I've grown weary of them resting on their laurels with the high sales figures.
PS4Deals,389zgl,ClassicalUrine,2,Wed Jun 3 03:32:08 2015 UTC,Except it's been more than 18 months since the ps4 launched... Just sayin'
PS4Deals,389zgl,HighZenDurp,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:34:48 2015 UTC,I actually think this collection of games are rubbish.
PS4Deals,389zgl,kilo20,3,Wed Jun 3 04:05:17 2015 UTC,"True. But they absolutely marketed the games as an advantage over Xbox live. So much so, Xbox had to copy it with their own program."
PS4Deals,389zgl,ClassicalUrine,8,Thu Jun 4 12:41:24 2015 UTC,Thanks. I added these games taking a shit. What a time to be alive.

PS4Deals,389zgl,Pensa23,7,Wed Jun 3 03:32:32 2015 UTC,And to think I was going to buy MGS for $8 a few weeks ago. Good thing I waited!
PS4Deals,389zgl,Pensa23,4,Wed Jun 3 04:17:58 2015 UTC,Good call for waiting! How do you like the game?
PS4Deals,389zgl,wohlstand,5,Wed Jun 3 17:21:49 2015 UTC,"Downloading it now! I'll let you know when I'm done, it shouldn't take that long since its such a short game. Haha."
PS4Deals,389zgl,airjer,4,Wed Jun 3 00:13:16 2015 UTC,If everyone waits for the games to get in ps+ I wonder how good that´s working for Sony
PS4Deals,3878z2,bossyox,6,Tue Jun 2 10:25:55 2015 UTC,Not worth it!! It's like putting 2 brillopads against your ears. They made the silver headset specifically to make you but the Gold.
PS4Deals,3878z2,BadNewsBrown,-12,Tue Jun 2 14:29:14 2015 UTC,"And the Gold to make you buy the real Turtle Beaches (Sony ones are just manufactured cheaply by Turtle Beach for Sony, they even lack Noise Cancel which all the original Turtle Beach Headsets have). Anyway these Silver ones for just $27.95 ? That´s a steal especially if you don´t need wireless. Better than paying $70-$100 for the gold and finding out they lack NOISE CANCEL too"
PS4Deals,3878z2,wohlstand,7,Tue Jun 2 16:19:58 2015 UTC,"I've had the gold headset since day one, and I couldn't ask for anything more. It's a great headset"
PS4Deals,3878z2,SylvesterLundgren,0,Tue Jun 2 16:54:04 2015 UTC,ive seen a lot of the band that goes over your head on the gold set break. I want to pick up a set but afraid this will happen. Thoughts?
PS4Deals,3878z2,Westlund,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:12:17 2015 UTC,"I've been using mine since Day 1, I even used them in lieu of my regular headphones for a couple months until i could got a new pair and couldn't have been happier. I have had zero issues with the band. Its a little more creaky than when i bought it, but honestly i really abused them for a while there. Overall I see no issue with the band or any part of the headset for that matter."
PS4Deals,3878z2,SylvesterLundgren,-6,Tue Jun 2 20:28:06 2015 UTC,Try a noise cancelling turtle beach surround sound headset and you will never go back to the gold
PS4Deals,3878z2,wohlstand,6,Tue Jun 2 19:45:08 2015 UTC,"I had one. And i went out and bought a gold headset as soon as it dropped, and i havent gone back."

PS4Deals,3878z2,Tsavorite,-3,Tue Jun 2 20:31:48 2015 UTC,Yeah right. But you do know the Sony ones are made by Turtle Beach in lower quality for Sony? Sony doesn´t produce them themselves..

PS4Deals,3878z2,hoffmanbrm,3,Tue Jun 2 14:31:50 2015 UTC,You cannot price match this since it isn't sold and shipped by Amazon.

Are these usb or controller port? I would love a nice headset but I hate the idea of a wire dragged all the way to my couch from the tv. Its why I use the vita earbuds.
PS4Deals,3878z2,FabulousPaul,3,Tue Jun 2 18:39:29 2015 UTC,It comes with USB and a 3.5 jack for the controller.

PS4Deals,3878z2,FabulousPaul,2,Tue Jun 2 20:29:15 2015 UTC,Note though that the 3.5mm jack won't give you virtual surround sound (if you're into that kind of thing). The surround sound will only work when plugged in via USB.
PS4Deals,3878z2,U-S-Eh,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:34:55 2015 UTC,Pretty dame good deal and it's fulfilled by Amazon so no need to worry about returns.

PS4Deals,3878z2,greatwhitehype_,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:41:37 2015 UTC,yea they're good for gaming and music I had no problems.
PS4Deals,3878z2,Regithiel,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:52:24 2015 UTC,For this price they might just be worth it. Cheaper than the Gold's while still maintaining most of its features. Good for those like me who are always on a tight budget.
PS4Deals,3878z2,huggythejerk,1 point,Tue Jun 2 11:37:33 2015 UTC,I don't really understand the difference even having skimmed over the Amazon pages for both; what is better about the gold over the silver?
PS4Deals,3878z2,pr0adam,1 point,Tue Jun 2 11:54:58 2015 UTC,"Wireless, way more comfortable imo.  The ear cups are just way better than the silver ones for me and it's not as tight."
PS4Deals,3878z2,ForeverUnclean,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:16:49 2015 UTC,"How tight are the silvers?  I've seen a few reviews that said they can squeeze your head too tight, and one that mentioned they're not good if you wear glasses because they squeeze your ears.  Either way, are they worth this price? They're really $70 normally?"
PS4Deals,3878z2,pr0adam,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:56:24 2015 UTC,"They squeezed my head too tight. I dont have glasses but I have large hair and a sort of large head. They hurt after an hour of use so I stretched them over the box they came in, and that helped a bit but I guess I stretched it too much or maybe they just stretched over my head too much and in a couple of weeks they cracked on the top.  I got it in a bundle and was lucky enough to be able to return it to Target and they refunded me $55. These havent been $70 for a long time, you can usually get the golds for that price now. Ive seen them for $30 on amazon consistently.  They are worth this price if your head isnt large. Just open the box carefully so worst case scenario you can return it back to Amazon.  Sorry about the long post but I wouldnt reccomend these unless you got a small head basically."
PS4Deals,3878z2,ForeverUnclean,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:06:36 2015 UTC,Thanks. Any idea if they have these to try on anywhere? I don't have a huge head but it's not small either so I don't know how well they would fit.  Can you recommend another pair for a similar price?
PS4Deals,3878z2,TammersHammers,2,Tue Jun 2 14:13:32 2015 UTC,"I have a pair of Silvers and wear a 7 3/8s fitted hat if that helps.  They were a bit tight initially, but then I read about the stretching over the box thing and that loosened them up a bit.  I can wear them for 4-5hrs and they don't really bother me much.  Had them for about 2 months now and I'm quite happy with my $30 purchase."
PS4Deals,3878z2,ForeverUnclean,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:58:45 2015 UTC,"Hm, not sure what size fitted hat I wear but maybe I'll try a few on the next time I'm at a store that has them. Thanks for the...ahem...heads up."
PS4Deals,3878z2,pr0adam,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:10:24 2015 UTC,"No I have no idea where you could try these on unfortunately. And similar price as in $30? Then no I wouldn't have another recommendation, sorry. In terms of sound, for $30, these were very good sounding. Your best bet is to price match this at best buy, try them for a week or whatever the limit is, and see if they hurt."

PS4Deals,383sz0,spike048,8,Mon Jun 1 17:30:05 2015 UTC,20 hours later and nobody has commented. I'm going to take that as a sign that this game sucks.
PS4Deals,383sz0,WorkRedditEqualsFun,2,Tue Jun 2 13:57:56 2015 UTC,Played the demo. The physics are like Watch_Dogs which is fine for a game like that but not for a racing game. I'll maybe buy it just to have it when it is below $10

Look at the controller charging plugs and the USB ports in the pictures and tell me what standards those adhere to and if you look at the reviews for the Ortz product on youtube you will see it looks exactly like the Boston Accessories one. Seems both companies are just reselling them.  Regardless, its a decent stand but the fans are really loud.  That aspect of it didn't bother me because I was just looking for a vertical stand and the controller charging ports are a bonus,  Apologies if I seem like I am trying to one up your post OP."

PS4Deals,382m56,RaffNav,2,Mon Jun 1 12:14:18 2015 UTC,This seems like a good deal. I have no experience with this device either. Does anyone know how reliable it is? Amazon reviews seem positive

Unfortunately there isn't really a clear answer to this. There is an 'official' vertical stand that suggests that it is okay to use the PS4 vertically. But there are numerous people including myself that have noticed that the PS4 tends to overheat then freeze/shut down more often when it is vertical. The stand supposedly removes the problem but some people have had the problem even with the stand.   Do a quick google search for 'Vertical PS4 overheat' and you should see what I mean.   My reasoning is when you place it on its side, the airflow gets restricted from one side and creates excess heat.   EDIT: added a few more thoughts."

I decided to give it a fair shot and I was immediately surprised to discover it was a 3rd Person shooter and initially, the movement felt pretty damn good for being a Cabela's game.  I then encountered my first 'exotic animal' and I realized a few things:  I love animals, why the fuck am I shooting at endangered species? The shooting mechanics in this game are absolutely atrocious. Holy shit, this may be the worst game released on the PS4 yet.  14 minutes played."

If you put practice in to learn combo's you'll enjoy it as much as I have since release, but honestly, the way the game is turned off 5 of my friends that bought it for practically no reason. If you think having level interactions and stamina is enough to turn you off, then just wait for the komplete edition. I doubt they'll do more DLC than those 4 characters, just like Mk9."

PS4Deals,3801do,acorsicanpimp,3,Sun May 31 22:48:32 2015 UTC,I loved being able to do that in some of the old Xbox WWE games. One of my favorite things. Too bad this price doesn't apply to the PC version because I'm pretty sure you can do that on it.

Or create versions of wrestlers from other feds like RVD with the Pantera entrance.

PS4Deals,3801do,slickestwood,2,Mon Jun 1 01:56:30 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't like it as much as '13 or '14. Most of the new gameplay features are nice, but chain wrestling gets boring fast IMO and I have trouble playing more than a few matches at a time because of it. It just guarantees a very slow start to every match and plays out the same pretty much every match. Career mode is pretty boring and knowing what happens when you finally win the title, I felt very little incentive to play it long. Showcase plays out like Attitude Era mode in '13, but I got stuck in a tag match in the Triple H/HBK storyline because tag matches are impossible to finish in this game. Your partner reacts to pin attempts so slow that every pin you attempt gets broken up 100% of the time unless you attack the partner, which can be frustrating to pull off. Since then, I haven't gone back to it. Most fun I had was downloading guys from NXT and other promotions and throwing them into Universe mode, which has gotten no better since '13 by the way.   But I feel like the engine and mechanics have potential that may just need to be refined for future installments."

There's a lot to do and the world's not super interesting (basically a lot of hills, occassionally a cool statue and a lake), but once you get into it, there's a bunch to see.  Then again, I loved Far Cry 3. This one doesn't have the same magic, but once you get the wingsuit (about 4-10ish hours in depending on how much you fool around) the world opens up.   Totally worth it at $30 IMO."

PS4Deals,37qpt6,dirkey93,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:18:17 2015 UTC,No you get 30% off a game that's out already. It has to be eligible for the promotion though. There'll be a small sign saying that it's eligible. You then put down a dollar towards a to be released game and they reserve it for you at that specific Target.

PS4Deals,37falg,spidey555,2,Wed May 27 18:12:35 2015 UTC,Cool. Thanks
PS4Deals,37falg,couldabeencool,1 point,Wed May 27 18:34:05 2015 UTC,"Tons of content for that price! I think it's an even better deal if you're playing with a friend, but solo is still great too unless you're looking for a super serious gripping story."
PS4Deals,37falg,Send_Headlight_Fluid,1 point,Wed May 27 13:37:11 2015 UTC,I kind of want it but it just seems like they went waaaaaay over the top for this installment. I loved 2 and 3 though. So much fun.
PS4Deals,37falg,TGrady902,1 point,Wed May 27 15:44:04 2015 UTC,Got it can't wait to play!
PS4Deals,37falg,TravisRSCX,1 point,Wed May 27 23:18:09 2015 UTC,Bought Re-Elected by itself full price at launch. Regret it everyday.
PS4Deals,37falg,CraziBoi94,1 point,Wed May 27 23:19:21 2015 UTC,"shit. I just bought the wrong one ):  i bought just the saints row re-elected for $25. it's 3:30 am and I guess I don't really think at this time. is there any way I can call them and explain what happened and get a refund?   edit: or should I just stick with it? because apparently it comes with a bunch of DLC, but not gat out of hell. but the bundle comes with both, but no DLC. HELP"
PS4Deals,37falg,SparkleFroFro93,1 point,Fri May 29 08:27:46 2015 UTC,"Hate to tell you this, but the bundle has all DLC too. You paid $10 more and didn't get Gat Out of Hell.   ""Re-elected"" is like ""Remastered"""
PS4Deals,37falg,Munstered,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:13:40 2015 UTC,yep. figured.
PS4Deals,37falg,SparkleFroFro93,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:12:28 2015 UTC,Avalible in Spanish?
PS4Deals,37falg,ejimeneze,1 point,Wed May 27 10:48:36 2015 UTC,Is this different from Saint Row 3? I played SR3 on the PS3 and hated it
PS4Deals,37falg,ronzon775,2,Wed May 27 11:25:32 2015 UTC,Depends what you hated about SR3
PS4Deals,37falg,MexicanKnight14,1 point,Wed May 27 11:35:29 2015 UTC,"It's even more absurd.  You go full superpowered in SR4.  I enjoyed both SR3 and 4, I thought they were hilarious."
PS4Deals,37falg,TheCivilJerk,-2,Wed May 27 18:01:15 2015 UTC,Maybe I came off a little salty. It's great for a short break when blood borne has me raging with frustration or when I get tired of reading all the great dialogue in the witcher. It however is only fun in short burst unless you can talk a friend into paying for it and playing with you.
PS4Deals,37falg,Tylerrex65,1 point,Wed May 27 06:40:17 2015 UTC,"So if I get a friend to play with this would be worth it, I've never really played 3 or 4, so would this be okay to me to deal with to just dick around with?"
PS4Deals,37falg,MufasaTheGreat,2,Wed May 27 06:47:56 2015 UTC,If you never played 3 or 4 I'm going to warn you ALOT has changed since the first 2 saints row games. It's completely over the top which can be a very entertaining thing. I think if you have a friend to play co op with and dick around with it is definitely worth $15. If your looking for your next game to satisfy your need for an engaging story id pass on it. It really is a lot of game for $15 tho
PS4Deals,37falg,Tylerrex65,-10,Wed May 27 07:07:31 2015 UTC,I'd rather have my $15 back...
PS4Deals,37fcph,DreadMcLaren,10,Wed May 27 05:32:18 2015 UTC,"If anyone hasn't played Rayman - pick it up now! I don't even like platformers but it could be my favorite game for the PS4.   Also, if I were to get one game out of Metro, Risk and Watch Dogs, which do I get?"
PS4Deals,37fcph,blekmyr,8,Wed May 27 07:17:49 2015 UTC,Metro
PS4Deals,37fcph,ET3RNA4,3,Wed May 27 12:57:43 2015 UTC,"Ok, any special reasons why?"
PS4Deals,37fcph,blekmyr,2,Wed May 27 13:17:13 2015 UTC,It's more of that the other games you listed are worse. Also if you've never played the metro series it's very good. Tons of content for a relatively cheap price.
PS4Deals,37fcph,ET3RNA4,3,Wed May 27 14:20:48 2015 UTC,"Okay cool. Just one question, is it scary? The description makes it sound kinda scary so I have to ask because I HATE scary games :D"
PS4Deals,37fcph,blekmyr,2,Wed May 27 15:17:29 2015 UTC,"hmm, not very scary, it's more of like a ""deep"" action type game. Some of the monsters and creatures you fight along with the scenario are pretty creepy though. But no pop,ups or anything like that."
PS4Deals,37fcph,ET3RNA4,1 point,Wed May 27 15:19:59 2015 UTC,"I found the first Bioshock to be kind of scary, but managed to power through it. Dead Space is completely unplayable for me.   This is somewhere in between the two. It's so atmospheric, it's hard not to get sucked into the game. Looks and plays great, but I had to walk away from it when a certain flying something came into play."
PS4Deals,37fcph,xincasinooutx,1 point,Wed May 27 15:37:00 2015 UTC,"Hmm okay, I'll look into some gameplay videos"
PS4Deals,37fcph,blekmyr,1 point,Wed May 27 17:06:54 2015 UTC,"I played with headphones (Sennheiser HD598s) and the music and atmosphere felt really oppressive. I was uneasy even in safe sections. Plus the shooting is designed to be kind of awkward, and when you have scary shit jumping at you it becomes terrifying and frustrating.   Beautiful game. But it's too scary for my tastes."
PS4Deals,37fcph,xincasinooutx,1 point,Thu May 28 12:26:23 2015 UTC,Hmm okay. Well Assassin's Creed IV went on sale here in Europe so I picked that up instead :)
PS4Deals,37fcph,blekmyr,2,Thu May 28 12:28:27 2015 UTC,"These are very different games. Watch Dogs is open world, got great stealth elements and a lot to do. While Metro is more or less corridor shooters always in the dark. Both are very good games tho."
PS4Deals,37fcph,wohlstand,4,Wed May 27 20:26:58 2015 UTC,Monopoly Plus freezes on PS4 and will render games unable to be completed as a result. Buyer beware.
PS4Deals,37fcph,dark_delight,2,Wed May 27 15:42:08 2015 UTC,"Is the Monopoly Fun Pack any good for the card game, or should I save a couple bucks and stick with the standard game? I need something for Family Game Night."
PS4Deals,37fcph,hoffmanbrm,5,Wed May 27 18:17:44 2015 UTC,Don't do it. That game has so many bugs it's unplayable.
PS4Deals,37fcph,Mister_Potamus,1 point,Wed May 27 19:49:37 2015 UTC,Don't listen to this guy. The base game is fine. Occasionally I will lag out of online games but local multiplayer is fine. The game is very well done as well.
PS4Deals,37fcph,trap_ghost_,2,Thu May 28 11:09:38 2015 UTC,How is trivia pursuit? I really want a good trivia game for the ps4
PS4Deals,37fcph,CrossFire43,-1,Thu May 28 00:53:56 2015 UTC,Soooo...  How is saints row?  I read that its a bit unstable
PS4Deals,37fcph,GuyWithASpoon,3,Wed May 27 15:34:01 2015 UTC,"Runs great and plays smooth on PS4, worth it at this price."
PS4Deals,37fcph,ShinyBloke,0,Wed May 27 20:20:17 2015 UTC,You are the first i see ever say this. Many others say it hard crashs ps4 and never got an update. Plus it looks like ps3. Does it have anti aliasing issues like the ps3 version?
PS4Deals,37fcph,wohlstand,5,Wed May 27 20:28:13 2015 UTC,"Looks good to me and plays fine, I have the game on PC, and really enjoyed it so I double dipped at that price.    I played for about 3 hours so far in 3 sittings,  and have zero issues with Saint Row 4."
PS4Deals,37fcph,ShinyBloke,2,Wed May 27 20:41:57 2015 UTC,That's actually part of the game
PS4Deals,37c86b,DowneasterJC,11,Tue May 26 15:44:17 2015 UTC,"Shipped and sold by Amazon, so you should be able to price match it at Walmart, Best Buy, etc."
PS4Deals,37c86b,G4mbit,2,Tue May 26 15:46:43 2015 UTC,Best comment! Thank you!
PS4Deals,37c86b,bmac92,8,Wed May 27 01:11:53 2015 UTC,These headphones are great. Highly recommended. I've had them for a while and haven't had a problem with them.
PS4Deals,37c86b,signofthenine,3,Tue May 26 16:57:21 2015 UTC,"These are so good, I actually bought a second set for the PC.  But pc only appears to support 2.0, FYI (still a great headset, though)."
PS4Deals,37c86b,iUsedtoHadHerpes,1 point,Wed May 27 03:33:11 2015 UTC,"How do they compare to conventional headphones (like Beats by Dre for example, which aren't known for their stellar quality)?"
PS4Deals,37c86b,G4mbit,1 point,Wed May 27 18:30:31 2015 UTC,Can you plug them in? And how does the sound compare to the Bose Ae2i over the ear headphones if you know what those are
PS4Deals,37c86b,bmac92,2,Wed May 27 01:12:25 2015 UTC,Yes. It come with a 3.5mm jack. I can't compare the sound quality as I've never used the bose headphones before.
PS4Deals,37c86b,ActionFlank,-27,Wed May 27 01:27:09 2015 UTC,Headset.  Don't confuse their sound quality with proper headphones.
PS4Deals,37c86b,Magai,3,Tue May 26 18:51:10 2015 UTC,Seems to be dead now.
PS4Deals,37c86b,Magai,3,Wed May 27 00:10:34 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's a Prime only price (does Amazon even do that?), but following the link still works for me."
PS4Deals,37c86b,Tsavorite,2,Wed May 27 05:34:14 2015 UTC,Yea I recently went back to it and it is the $68 price again. Earlier I went to it and it was the regular price.
PS4Deals,37c86b,milw00kiee,1 point,Wed May 27 05:40:59 2015 UTC,Active now but make sure you switch to amazon as the seller to get the price. Back ordered for 2-3weeks.  Ordered today
PS4Deals,37c86b,DawkinsDarwin,2,Fri May 29 22:40:23 2015 UTC,anyone know if these also pair up with the VIta and/or PSTV ?  I think I recall seeing these do work with the former so mainly curious about the latter.
PS4Deals,37c86b,bmac92,2,Tue May 26 17:18:25 2015 UTC,It comes with a headphone jack accessory for the vita or anything else.
PS4Deals,37c86b,LTComedy,2,Tue May 26 18:58:41 2015 UTC,"They'll work fine, just not wirelessly."
PS4Deals,37c86b,MooForMe,2,Tue May 26 19:28:54 2015 UTC,God I hope this deal lasts through the weekend
PS4Deals,37c86b,Gcoks,2,Tue May 26 19:22:02 2015 UTC,I bought this yesterday for 85$. Having amazon refund me the difference.
PS4Deals,37c86b,udbluehens,1 point,Tue May 26 22:25:50 2015 UTC,Got them to price match at Bestbuy today. Thanks for the tip!

PS4Deals,37c86b,AtomicMenace,1 point,Thu May 28 22:54:21 2015 UTC,"Worked at Target. After a few gift cards I had laying around and my RedCard, they came to $55 with tax. Nice!"
PS4Deals,37ceki,Iron_Jesus,3,Tue May 26 16:29:37 2015 UTC,Details?
PS4Deals,37ceki,mrbearbear,3,Tue May 26 19:16:35 2015 UTC,"You can't see it on mobile, but there's a trade-in banner above the bundles. From what I can tell, it looks like you get a $100 Best Buy gift card and a $75 voucher towards a PS4."
PS4Deals,37ceki,LukeNeverShaves,2,Tue May 26 19:54:13 2015 UTC,Damn wish it was $175 in gift cards. I'd get me a xbone to go with my ps4. Haha
PS4Deals,37ceki,pickuptwix,1 point,Sat May 30 22:53:47 2015 UTC,Trade it in for your ps4 then try to trade someone for a brand new xbox?
PS4Deals,37ceki,majindan007,2,Tue Jun 2 22:44:16 2015 UTC,"It's in the Sunday flyer as well, picked my PS4 up Sunday evening...PS3 Slim, 1 hdmi, power cable, controller not needed. They wanted to give me $8 for my DS3, I kept it."
PS4Deals,37ceki,joker5527,1 point,Tue May 26 23:05:28 2015 UTC,"I was going to do 2 ps3 traded in for 1 ps4 and it will work but only partially. For each ps3 you trade in, you get 100$ gift card and a 75$ coupon. Since you can only use one 75$ coupon per ps4 you will miss out on the 2nd 75$ coupon use. Just my two cents."
PS4Deals,37ceki,flyufools,1 point,Tue May 26 19:30:25 2015 UTC,You can just trade in the system without purchasing a PS4? I'd rather put $175 towards the flood of games coming out this year...
PS4Deals,37ceki,joker5527,3,Tue May 26 19:48:51 2015 UTC,Well you would only get $100 in the form of a gift card to use towards games or whatever. The other $75 is a voucher for a PS4. At least that's what I think the promotion is saying.
PS4Deals,37ceki,Garrick75,2,Tue May 26 19:55:37 2015 UTC,You are correct. I was handed a 100$ gift card and a 75$ non stackable coupon that was only valid toward a ps4.
PS4Deals,37ceki,Neff619,1 point,Tue May 26 20:03:38 2015 UTC,Was there any kind of expiration date on either?
PS4Deals,37ceki,TheNAC,1 point,Wed May 27 05:26:49 2015 UTC,"I have an Xbox 360 Elite 120GB, I just bought the 250gb hard drive off eBay, would that work? It said IF you have a 250gb+ Xbox, you get the $100, so I just bought a new HD."
PS4Deals,37ceki,Neff619,2,Tue May 26 21:36:04 2015 UTC,They scan the serial number so it goes by the model not the actual size.
PS4Deals,37ceki,Tostidohead,2,Tue May 26 21:46:56 2015 UTC,So I pretty much just wasted $35 on a HD then damn....
PS4Deals,37ceki,Inframidi,1 point,Wed May 27 02:07:54 2015 UTC,I have a 20gb 360 can I get anything?
PS4Deals,37ceki,neekohlai,1 point,Wed May 27 18:18:55 2015 UTC,Yeah. $75 towards a PS4.
PS4Deals,37ceki,Inframidi,1 point,Thu May 28 03:10:08 2015 UTC,So I'm a bit confused on the deal here.  Can you or can you not stack the gift cards towards the purchase of a PS4?  Also anyone aware if they are doing this deal for a 250 GB Modern Warfare 2 Edition 360?
PS4Deals,37ceki,Joesmurf96,1 point,Thu May 28 01:09:21 2015 UTC,"I don't see why Best Buy wouldn't let you use the gift card toward the PS4. It's for anything in the store. As for the MW2 edition, I'd call ahead just to see."
PS4Deals,37c5q9,GoTeamJosh,3,Tue May 26 15:27:09 2015 UTC,"Just in case anyone's on the fence, it's fantastic."
PS4Deals,37c5q9,squaretableknight,3,Wed May 27 05:59:54 2015 UTC,I've been on the fence for awhile due to lack of time to devote to such a game but this won me over. I couldn't turn it down. I bought it and then I shared it with the rest of you.
PS4Deals,37c5q9,seandan317,3,Wed May 27 12:26:57 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking about buying it, is it really that good?"
PS4Deals,37c5q9,dylang5,2,Wed May 27 14:59:04 2015 UTC,"It's pretty damn good, and I've never played an RPG or Souls game. So yeah, it's great."

PS4Deals,37c5q9,seandan317,2,Wed May 27 15:35:55 2015 UTC,I just ordered it. Everyone says it's good so I guess it has to be.
PS4Deals,37c5q9,BigDun,1 point,Wed May 27 15:45:39 2015 UTC,Go buy it!
PS4Deals,37c5q9,lethal831,1 point,Wed May 27 02:11:21 2015 UTC,I've never played games like this.. I always buy sports games and shooting games.. Man... This game is awesome..  I can't stop playing...  It's worth $60!!!!!!
PS4Deals,37c5q9,Tylerrex65,3,Sun May 31 15:38:09 2015 UTC,I completely disagree with waiting... I picked this up for $40 at BestBuy yesterday and I'd gladly pay the extra $20 if they tried to take it back from me. Whatever the DLC cost i'll end up buying it. It is putting the witcher and everything else I own on the back burner
PS4Deals,377tr7,DreadMcLaren,6,Mon May 25 16:18:56 2015 UTC,Thanks for the heads up. I finally got mine today. The deal worked in the store too. No issues.
PS4Deals,377tr7,Jmccu7r,1 point,Mon May 25 21:17:36 2015 UTC,How's the silver headset? I've heard both good and bad reviews for it.
PS4Deals,377tr7,project442,3,Mon May 25 22:17:26 2015 UTC,"Put a book or two between the ears when you aren't using them. Don't want them to be too stretched, so do a little at first. If they are still too tight you can add another book the next time. Works like a charm for me. Just like working in a new baseball mitt, but nott."
PS4Deals,377tr7,Computerzing,1 point,Tue May 26 02:46:03 2015 UTC,I just took a stack of DVD cases and put the headset on them. Stretched them out and it's not nearly as bad as it was when I first got them.
PS4Deals,377tr7,jangobotito,1 point,Tue May 26 22:56:08 2015 UTC,"I got this bundle before the year of plus was added to it, the head set is awesome, but it's just really tight, it hurts my ears pretty bad. I hear people just stretch them out and it's much better."
PS4Deals,377tr7,GoldenGod2112,1 point,Thu May 28 18:04:14 2015 UTC,Haven't tested it out in game yet but first impressions are that they are extremely comfortable
PS4Deals,377tr7,Jmccu7r,8,Mon May 25 22:33:29 2015 UTC,I really think stores are selling a lot of these bundles because a price drop is coming after E3.
PS4Deals,377tr7,project442,1 point,Mon May 25 22:38:58 2015 UTC,"I'm holding out for the PS4 price drop as well.  E3 June 16 is coming up soon, however Sony announced ps3 slim with price drop during Gamescom 2009."
PS4Deals,377tr7,Basic85,1 point,Mon May 25 17:51:57 2015 UTC,"That, and/or new slim hardware, which is why I'm holding out as well. Once the cat is out of the bag, I'm betting the deals will be even sweeter for these older bundles."

PS4Deals,377tr7,RaffNav,2,Tue May 26 02:46:53 2015 UTC,That is a really small window of time! Glad I have the day off tomorrow. You think they will have this offer at the physical stores or online only?

PS4Deals,377tr7,TacoKingBean,2,Mon May 25 19:25:28 2015 UTC,Leave it in rest mode. Go to bed. That game is totally worth the time. It changed me
PS4Deals,377tr7,ShaneRunninShirtless,0,Tue May 26 12:04:11 2015 UTC,Rest or upgrade your internet speed.
PS4Deals,377tr7,BaconWithThat,2,Tue May 26 02:32:24 2015 UTC,"I literally got mine 3 days ago. Same deal, but without plus. That blows."

At this price though you're getting a PSTV, Controller, and 2 games for damn near the same price as the PSTV. I might not even use the PSTV, other than maybe vita games  EDIT: Oops.

PS4Deals,375x36,laccro,-2,Mon May 25 04:12:26 2015 UTC,They meant additional 10% off of the original $60 price
PS4Deals,375x36,mesenkomaha,-1,Mon May 25 15:01:56 2015 UTC,Mind blown.  10% off the 60 dollars gives you 24 and 20% off of the sale price of 30 gets 24!  Incredible!
PS4Deals,375x36,mesenkomaha,0,Mon May 25 16:10:13 2015 UTC,10% of 30 is 3 dollars though.  So if it was 10% of the PS Plus price of 30 that would be 27 bucks.
PS4Deals,375x36,Screamin11,6,Mon May 25 16:45:12 2015 UTC,What an awesome deal - that is a shitload of content.

But it's more strategy oriented than what you'd expect from Call Of Duty, which is more of a run-around-and-just-shoot-nonstop kind of game. A little slower paced.

The gameplay is solid, but the content is boring, reused over and over and over, and unless you like grinding might not be for you.

While the community seems to be a decent group, they're all mostly in love with Destiny despite it's failings."
PS4Deals,375x36,the_good_dr,4,Mon May 25 12:37:25 2015 UTC,Do yourself a favor and stay far away from destiny.  It takes the worst parts of MMOs and puts them into an fps.

PS4Deals,374b2y,Golden_Taint,4,Sun May 24 19:19:46 2015 UTC,Far Cry 4 is $29.99 at Target right now. They also just added a coupon to their free Cartwheel app (iOS or Android) that gives you 25% off of Far Cry 4. Enjoy!
PS4Deals,374b2y,RudyBagels,1 point,Sun May 24 19:20:29 2015 UTC,I don't see it on the cartwheel app. :/  EDIT: Found it! search Far Cry 4 in the app. It won't list under video games for some reason.
PS4Deals,374b2y,mrbickyrobby,2,Sun May 24 20:43:41 2015 UTC,I ended up getting far cry and the crew for $24 each after taxes. Thanks for the post!
PS4Deals,374b2y,odel555q,1 point,Mon May 25 14:45:17 2015 UTC,"In Cartwheel it says the offer is valid for ""Playstation and XBox"", does anyone know whether this includes PS3?  I'd hate to head to Target and find out that it only works for the PS4 version."
PS4Deals,374b2y,odel555q,3,Sun May 24 22:24:19 2015 UTC,It should work no prob.  Thought about upgrading to PS4? Best Buy is offering $175 for your PS3 right now if you trade up to PS4. If you have a few games to trade as well you could really make it a cheap upgrade.
PS4Deals,374b2y,odel555q,1 point,Sun May 24 22:30:00 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, that sounds intriguing!  Where can I find more info?"
PS4Deals,374b2y,odel555q,2,Sun May 24 22:32:22 2015 UTC,"Go to this page at Best Buy's website, you'll see the ""Trade in Trade up"" banner near the top. The way the deal works is: if you trade in a PS3 or Xbox 360, you get a coupon good for $75 off of a PS4. Then, you also get a gift card for the console you're trading in as well. If it's a PS3 Slim, you get at least a $100 gift card. If it's another model PS3, you won't get as much on a gift card but you'll  still get the $75 coupon.  That gift card value is just for the console and power supply. You get additional credit for all controllers and any games you trade in. You can look up game values here to see what you'll get for your games ahead of time.  Do you have a Slim?"
PS4Deals,374b2y,CharlesViBritannia,1 point,Sun May 24 22:47:21 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see, thanks for the info.  Yeah, I have a slim and it works perfectly.  I found that page myself but the fine print made me think that I would get either a $75 or $100 gift card, so I couldn't figure out why they claimed it was a $175 deal.  Looks like most of my games are only worth $1, I think I could get more than that if I sold them on eBay."
PS4Deals,374b2y,odel555q,1 point,Sun May 24 22:51:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no point in selling a game for $1, might as well donate it to a hospital or something at that point. But $175 for your Slim is great, you should consider pulling the trigger."
PS4Deals,374b2y,arcarsenel,1 point,Sun May 24 23:16:46 2015 UTC,I think I'm going to head up there right now!  Thanks for the info!
PS4Deals,374b2y,odel555q,1 point,Sun May 24 23:17:45 2015 UTC,Best Buy is offering $175   How can we find more about this deal? I just googled it and it says it dead
PS4Deals,374b2y,EastCoastLA,1 point,Sun May 24 22:42:19 2015 UTC,"I found info here: http://www.bestbuy.com/site/playstation-4-ps4/playstation-4-ps4-hardware-console/pcmcat296300050017.c?id=pcmcat296300050017  That's in the US by the way.  However, the fine print says you'll get a $75 gift card if you bring in a PS3, or a $100 gift card if you bring in a PS3 slim.  I don't see how it becomes $175."

PS4Deals,374b2y,odel555q,1 point,Wed May 27 16:20:49 2015 UTC,So I just got back from Target (in the US) and they only had the Limited Edition and it was $39.99.  I asked one of the workers if they had the regular version for $29.99 and he said no.
PS4Deals,374b2y,haunv1,2,Mon May 25 01:28:50 2015 UTC,"The limited edition was just what they shipped for pre-orders, your store just has some left (same thing happened to me, I only bought my copy last month). It's the same sku/product code as the regular Far Cry 4. They must have it tagged $39.99 in the store, tell them they need to price match it to their own website which is $29.99. After they make the adjustment, you pull out your phone and have them scan your Cartwheel barcode, which will drop it down from there."
PS4Deals,374em9,yveltari,2,Sun May 24 19:48:57 2015 UTC,Anyone know if they buy XB1s? This a a lot better than anything at Gamestop.
PS4Deals,374em9,i5ReaL,3,Sun May 24 22:21:56 2015 UTC,No. The only console Target takes on trade is the DS/3DS.

PS4Deals,374em9,Diaz218,1 point,Mon May 25 07:29:26 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure you can price match and then get use the Cartwheel to save the $40 off the total, because they're two different things."
PS4Deals,374em9,Iron_Jesus,3,Mon May 25 01:43:28 2015 UTC,Nah I talk to them on the phone with an ETL. They don't do price match if it comes with an accessory. They do for price though.

PS4Deals,36wfia,BlitzKraig1,1 point,Sat May 23 01:14:19 2015 UTC,"The remote play app used to be available on any Android,  but a recent update seems to have made it for Sony phones only.  Unless there have been changes within the last week."
PS4Deals,36wfia,SuperRobotPimpJesus,2,Sat May 23 01:48:51 2015 UTC,I don't think the remote play was available on Androids besides the Sony phone but there is an apk you can download that works with most android phones and tablet all you got to do is a little Googleing if you want to find it. Edit: http://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/ps4-remote-play-android-thread-t3068225 found a link if you want.

PS4Deals,36wfia,SuperRobotPimpJesus,1 point,Wed May 27 01:22:01 2015 UTC,On Sony Xperia and most other android devices you can use remote play for the PS4 with a Dualshock. Emulated games work really well with a controller as well.
PS4Deals,36wfia,Scorpionfire12,1 point,Sat May 23 01:49:53 2015 UTC,"The main reason I use it is for emulators. I have ePSXe with a double ended microusb cable, and I can play anything without any issues now. As far as keeping it on the controller permanently, there's really no practical use for that.

PS4Deals,36wfia,greengorilla60,2,Tue May 26 03:14:43 2015 UTC,You can either buy a little micro usb to micro usb cable or connect it wirelessly with certain phones via blutooth. I've been using it for emulators.
PS4Deals,36wfia,greengorilla60,1 point,Wed May 27 19:09:04 2015 UTC,How do I connect it via Bluetooth.
PS4Deals,36vdpb,swotam,1 point,Fri May 22 12:43:51 2015 UTC,It's cheaper than Best Buy Canada who have it on sale for $49.99 this week. Good opportunity to price match.
PS4Deals,36s0ni,DreadMcLaren,4,Thu May 21 17:36:19 2015 UTC,I just went to Target and pricematched this controller and used my Redcard to get another 5% off. Just throwing that out there to anyone who's interested and has a Redcard.

PS4Deals,36s0ni,separate_realities,5,Fri May 22 01:21:49 2015 UTC,Hmm in need of a new controller. 40$ was the lowest ds4 have ever gotten right?
PS4Deals,36s0ni,taylorxo,3,Thu May 21 18:45:38 2015 UTC,That's about as low as I've ever seen them anyway.
PS4Deals,36s0ni,separate_realities,5,Thu May 21 18:52:12 2015 UTC,I bought one for $25 this last Christmas when K Mart was having those weirdly crazy markdowns on everything. Price matched at Best Buy no problem.
PS4Deals,36s0ni,taylorxo,3,Thu May 21 19:54:46 2015 UTC,"Damn, that's a great price."
PS4Deals,36s0ni,Whyku,6,Thu May 21 20:00:47 2015 UTC,I know right! It's ridiculous how expensive these controllers are. They can't really be that expensive to produce. It's some wiring and a battery and a light all wrapped up in plastic. $50 for that seems a little high.
PS4Deals,36s0ni,GladiusDei,3,Thu May 21 22:37:37 2015 UTC,"They put a fuck load of money into the making of it, that could count for some of the price?"

PS4Deals,36mcvx,IrishTheHobbit,7,Wed May 20 13:10:21 2015 UTC,I wish there was also digital deal. Boxed games are too expensive in my country.
PS4Deals,36mcvx,nesir,4,Wed May 20 15:48:38 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up for anyone on the fence. Bought it last month even if I had dropped the series for some time now.  After a few hours in, I thought it was really dull and was annoyed by some bugs when going for a specific wall and Arno decided that there was a better way but... I saw an invitation for online mission and man... That's worth $20 to me. The missions are great when playing with 3 other people.  I'm not into online and mostly play only GTA with friends but unity is quite good for that. So, now youyou know...!  Thanks /u/IrishTheHobbit for sharing the deal."
PS4Deals,36mcvx,Dedale,2,Wed May 20 14:19:12 2015 UTC,"Alright, so if I was only playing single-player, it wouldn't be ideal since that's pretty much the only way I'll play.  Also, why was it dull? Story or are the missions just shitty haha."
PS4Deals,36mcvx,badtree132,2,Wed May 20 15:12:10 2015 UTC,I guess it's just the gameplay which didn't really evolved much to me. I know the fanboys will argue that now you can do more but... The nice thing to me is the inside buildings opportunities you have.  I'm French and got hammered in school about the revolution so maybe there's that but the story is cliché and so far Arno doesn't compare to Altair or Ezio in terms of charisma.

PS4Deals,36mcvx,OriginalUneeK,1 point,Tue May 26 17:54:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the heads up! So this looks like an ideal game so long as you've got friends to play with.  Or were these just some random people? Did you get the vibe you needed a mic, too?  Haven't played an AC game since I played the first four hours of ACIII. Just thinking about that game gives me anxiety."
PS4Deals,36mcvx,space_sandwich,3,Wed May 20 14:40:01 2015 UTC,Exactly the same thing for me. Few hours in 3 and dropped. I don't feel like a mic is necessary as it's pretty straightforward in terms of what to do and you can do it. I didn't try with friends but people at random were good enough. Definitely a plus for the game I'd say. Better than watchdogs anyway :)

PS4Deals,36j50l,Bill_Brasky01,3,Wed May 20 15:25:06 2015 UTC,It's a really good game and is different from dead Island if u didn't like that . The price didn't fall much for it but the base game alone imo is still worth full price

I never really understood what was going on during heist, so i just played Blood money and hotwire. The thing that made me trade it in was thr fact that only 3-5 of all the weapons are useful, meaning almost 1 gun is only useful for each class, the rest are trash and you'll straight up lose if you use them. I hate ganes without weapon variety, getting killed by M16 tryhards with 100 gold service stars gets boring real fucking fast."

PS4Deals,36j50l,ExOTiC1234,2,Wed May 20 17:53:26 2015 UTC,Was hoping for driveclub season pass.
PS4Deals,36j50l,Sgt_ZigZag,1 point,Tue May 19 21:24:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah me too. I guess we can be confident that a price drop is coming though. It seems like the new pricing model is Game + DLC + Season Pass, with all three components falling in price over time."
PS4Deals,36j50l,PickerLeech,2,Wed May 20 00:04:30 2015 UTC,Awesome. I've been waiting for a good deal on FIFA 15. Finally a digital sale that saves me money over a physical copy.
PS4Deals,36j50l,hypnopoo,2,Tue May 19 22:56:54 2015 UTC,Any of the season passes really stand out as must-own quality? I have a lot of these games that have Season Passes and have never considered getting it until now.
PS4Deals,36j50l,Cyntax,3,Wed May 20 01:01:39 2015 UTC,"Shadow of Mordor DLC is a decent deal considering that you're getting 2 story-type DLC and not just challenge maps or cosmetic junk. A friend of mine said it was ""ok"", and he paid full price so it's probably worth $14. I'll be getting this one.  Watch Dogs for $10 isn't bad, the story DLC is supposed to be alright. I'll be picking it up myself.  Far Cry 4, maybe not a great deal. The Yeti DLC is the only story-type DLC, the rest is just single missions or  escape the prison stuff. I'd wait for this one to drop down around $7 personally unless you like all the stuff the season pass offers.  Alien Isolation season pass offers 5 additional Survival/Challenge scenarios, some of which are quite long. If you liked the one provided in the base game, you'll probably like the DLC. If you just want more story DLC, avoid it."
PS4Deals,36j50l,swotam,3,Wed May 20 13:51:45 2015 UTC,"fair warning: The Shadow of Mordor DLC is also disconnected from the main story so you never get to play around as much as you can in the original. Just look up ""Kotaku Shadow of Mordor DLC review"""
PS4Deals,36j50l,badtree132,1 point,Wed May 20 15:31:49 2015 UTC,probably BF4 premiums
PS4Deals,36j50l,ExOTiC1234,2,Wed May 20 11:09:11 2015 UTC,Is Shadow of Mordor DLC worth getting? I've heard mixed reviews about it. Or should I stick with Alien: Isolation DLC?
PS4Deals,36j50l,Hoboshanker,3,Wed May 20 01:14:05 2015 UTC,"Alien Isolation DLC is strictly more challenge maps, so if you liked the one that was included with the base game you'll probably like the DLC. I haven't played the SoM DLC, but a buddy of mine said it was ""ok"". At $14 with the Plus discount it's not a bad deal."
PS4Deals,36j50l,swotam,2,Wed May 20 13:47:24 2015 UTC,"I have a 48 Playstation Plus membership code that I haven't redeemed yet. If I use it, can I get the PS Plus prices for these games, and will I still have access to them once that 48 hour trial runs out?"
PS4Deals,36j50l,begonelittleindian,5,Wed May 20 02:03:01 2015 UTC,"You will definitely have access to them after the trial runs out, as you still paid for the game. However I'm not entirely sure you will get the discount price off a trial, but I'm gonna assume you do."
PS4Deals,36j50l,pr0adam,1 point,Wed May 20 02:20:34 2015 UTC,It's also worth noting that if you want to access the multiplayer you have to have PS Plus.

Worth the price? I don't have shadow of Mordor Base game, but really want it. Is this DLC any good?   Dang ittttt... I don't think I can resist Watch Dog's + Season Pass for 24.99. Is the DLC good?"
PS4Deals,36j50l,Bill_Brasky01,2,Wed May 20 01:19:25 2015 UTC,"Shadow of Mordor is fun. Haven't played the dlc for it, but I would imagine it's more of the same fun, just as a new character.   The Watch_Dogs dlc is pretty alright. Lots of explosions."
PS4Deals,36j50l,CitrusLikeAnOrange,1 point,Wed May 20 05:20:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback. I decided to pass on the Shadow of Mordor DLC, but I still plan on getting the base game in the twenty dollar range. I went a head and got Watch Dogs too because I'd like to have a new open world game AND I read that the DLC is COOP!!   Kotaku Watch_Dogs DLC Review. I liked this review because it doesn't assign some lame number. The author plays it and talks about whether he had fun or not. tl;dr - He did."
PS4Deals,36j50l,Bill_Brasky01,2,Wed May 20 15:36:58 2015 UTC,No problem at all. I was seemingly one of the very few who actually quite enjoyed Watch_Dogs. It's just a fun experience for the most part.
PS4Deals,36j50l,CitrusLikeAnOrange,2,Wed May 20 16:23:02 2015 UTC,"Sniper Elite 3 was really good in my opinion, and for $20 with a PS+ discount you can't really go wrong considering that the Ultimate Edition includes all the DLC, which by itself cost way more than $20.  Shadow of Mordor was enjoyable, haven't played the DLC since I was waiting for a sale and this looks like a decent price. Watch Dogs plus the Season Pass for $25 is a decent deal as well."
PS4Deals,36j50l,swotam,1 point,Wed May 20 13:45:13 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback on Sniper Elite. I think I'm going to pick up that game as well. Thus far I'm in on BF4 Premium and Watchdog's gold edition.
PS4Deals,36j50l,Bill_Brasky01,1 point,Wed May 20 15:32:36 2015 UTC,Is Mafia 2 worth 6 dollars or should I just wait for a sale on PC?
PS4Deals,36j50l,Tezla55,0,Wed May 20 04:14:15 2015 UTC,Should I get Hardline Deluxe or Battlefield 3 premium edition? Need an answer asap thanks fellas
PS4Deals,36j50l,TheBrodieGonnaBro,2,Wed May 20 01:37:36 2015 UTC,If you want a true battlefield game go with BF4 but if you like close to mid quarters combat with face pace action with the battlefield mixed with COD and Counter strike feel go with Hardline. My personal favorite is BF4 but Hardline's gamemodes are very fun compared to BF4
PS4Deals,36j50l,Jon0u,1 point,Wed May 20 04:55:33 2015 UTC,Hardlines weapon balance sucks. When the game heavily relies on infantry combat and there are like 1-2 guns per class that are unstoppable and the rest are fucking trash...theres a problem.

PS4Deals,36gg32,DudeGuy123,1 point,Tue May 19 13:23:15 2015 UTC,It’s a great game. Wait ’til you ride an elephant and wreck shit up.

PS4Deals,36gg32,InappropriateHandle,2,Tue May 19 16:36:03 2015 UTC,Bought it from Gamestop for $25 used two days ago.
PS4Deals,36gg32,TheNAC,-2,Tue May 19 19:32:49 2015 UTC,Game was a disappointment as a longtime Far Cry fan (played the original on PC and all instincts games too).
PS4Deals,36gg32,Find_the_Door,5,Tue May 19 12:49:50 2015 UTC,"Yep, it's a big step back from Far Cry 3. The enemy placement is random and irritating compared to the puzzle-like encounters in FC3; the lighting is lazily implemented global illumination with no custom touches, which can make for some really ugly splotches of black and generally poorly lit scenes; and the game-world itself looks like it was procedurally generated.  And there's a big, nasty twitch in the walking animation. Seriously EVERY pass through its loop makes the camera twitch noticeably. That combined with the constant head-bobbling animations when climbing rocks and running are enough to make me physically nauseous. And I usually have a very high tolerance for poor motion aesthetics. I can play a game with a low FOV and frame rate all day, but FC4 is a special kind of shitty."
PS4Deals,36gg32,Fjdijtsk,5,Tue May 19 17:06:05 2015 UTC,"At least you understand.  3 was great, had awesome characters, believable story, good shooting mechanics, great animals, awesome setting."
PS4Deals,36gg32,Find_the_Door,2,Tue May 19 17:46:06 2015 UTC,"The biggest thing is that Far Cry 3 is its own game, made from the ground up to be as fun as possible in its own unique way. The stealth mechanics and takedowns really made it stand out as a masterpiece in game design. Far Cry 4 was simply a copy of it, and a lot of the polish and charm was lost in the move to Kyrat. It doesn't look as good, and it doesn't play as well."
PS4Deals,36fcls,RaffNav,2,Mon May 18 23:15:15 2015 UTC,Went to Gamestop earlier and got this :) Finally I have a PS4!

PS4Deals,36fcls,figgycal,1 point,Tue May 19 03:06:49 2015 UTC,"Meh, I have the silver set, nothing wrong with it.

PS4Deals,36fcls,pr0adam,1 point,Tue May 19 11:50:45 2015 UTC,Have you used it outside the PS4? How does the sound quality compare to other headphones. They're going for less than 30 on Amazon and I'm considering getting them.

PS4Deals,367jsh,gytfet,4,Sun May 17 04:58:35 2015 UTC,Awesome! Just picked this up via Prime Now. I was waiting on a good deal. Only played about an hour so far last night but it's already really tense - and I haven't even encountered the alien yet!
PS4Deals,367jsh,mrmogget,3,Sun May 17 15:45:29 2015 UTC,I price matched this at target.  It wasn't until I got home that I noticed I snagged the nostromo edition of the game!  I don't think the people checking prices will notice it cause the font blends in the background. Can't wait to play this game!

PS4Deals,367jsh,sonicb00m42,1 point,Tue May 19 01:16:59 2015 UTC,Why is it that the physical copy is cheaper than the digital? I've started buying the majority of my games digitally and this is kind of annoying.
PS4Deals,367jsh,medic8er,1 point,Mon May 18 17:12:07 2015 UTC,"With digital copies, stores/sites never have to worry about clearing physical inventory space. That's one of the benefits of physical games for consumers. They're often going to be cheaper, especially when they've been out longer. Plus you can buy them used."

Also on sale at Best Buy Canada this week for $49.99, as well as WalMart Canada for $49, so lots of options if you haven't purchased this yet. It's one of those must-play games in my opinion, but be aware that it's a tough game that will reward you for your persistence."

PS4Deals,35zqc6,debello64,1 point,Fri May 15 12:51:02 2015 UTC,@movieguru92  Haha...did the same thing. Ordered the LoU bundle last Sunday for $399 on Amazon. Just wrote them and they actually gave me a $59.99 credit to my credit card statement. We give them a ton of business so they were willing to give a concession.   I actually prefer the credit so I can use it towards a worthwhile game (imo).

They work great. Recommended to some friends and they love them as well. Retail price is usually $80, but I've seen them for $60 at times. You can order the top without the adapter for $60 from the website. Then just plug it into the audio jack on the dualshock."

Keep in mind that games requiring the touch screen won't work in all cases. There is a compatibility list somewhere.  Also, I'm not sure if it has a game slot or only plays games downloaded via PSN. You'll have to look that up.  I believe you can use DS4 and DS3 controllers but I could be wrong."

This is the best deal I can find as of late for a Canadian controller, perhaps Indigo.ca is cheaper with their 20% off code if theirs is listed cheaper than other retailers."
PS4Deals,35vf8n,Screamin11,1 point,Thu May 14 14:01:14 2015 UTC,Cheaper at Indigo - Listed price starts at $64.95 with a 20% off visa checkout discount. Either Black or Blue available. http://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/electronics/dualshock-4-wireless-controller-wave/711719039631-item.html?ikwid=ps4+controller&ikwsec=Home&ikwidx=1
PS4Deals,35ts5n,IrishTheHobbit,5,Wed May 13 13:18:45 2015 UTC,Definitely worth the price. I wont buy it since Im still butthurt about coming home to find my brand new copy cracked inside my PS4.
PS4Deals,35ts5n,bane9907,2,Wed May 13 15:41:18 2015 UTC,Why didn't you return it?
PS4Deals,35ts5n,bane9907,2,Wed May 13 22:02:31 2015 UTC,Because it was opened. I think one of my kids broke it and tried to play it off.
PS4Deals,35ts5n,bane9907,1 point,Wed May 13 22:38:31 2015 UTC,You most likely could have returned it and said it was cracked when you opened it. Especially if it was a fresh purchase.
PS4Deals,35ts5n,citrus3000psi,2,Wed May 13 22:43:54 2015 UTC,It was like a week. I ended up getting it free from plus but couldnt bring myself to play it on the ps3.
PS4Deals,35ts5n,RockTheShaz,2,Wed May 13 22:49:29 2015 UTC,This is a great price for the physical game.
PS4Deals,35ts5n,ssamios,2,Wed May 13 17:06:08 2015 UTC,Bought this for $20 on black Friday. Definitely a $60 game
PS4Deals,35ts5n,jcal0032,2,Wed May 13 17:23:18 2015 UTC,"Absolutely worth the price, I get the sense of that this is what the order 1886 move like feel if they hadn't messed it up."
PS4Deals,35ts5n,Tylerslavin,1 point,Wed May 13 15:49:44 2015 UTC,"Got this for like $15 digital during an Ubisoft sale. Awesome game, and I would gladly pay this had I not already picked it up."

My question is whether or not this is worth my time or if it's mostly just a graphics upgrade? I know there's some DLC but if it's mostly just outfits and such, I'll probably just pass."
PS4Deals,35tsno,IrishTheHobbit,1 point,Wed May 13 13:23:13 2015 UTC,It's also $20 at gamestop brand new.
PS4Deals,35tsno,Cra2yey3z,0,Sat May 16 09:56:48 2015 UTC,Be wary.  I've played through this game a few times and there are some level breaking glitches.   The game is very fun but having to replay a level can be frustrating.
PS4Deals,35tsno,Folk_,2,Wed May 13 15:35:08 2015 UTC,Where at? I got it recently and am on Ch. 4 of 2033. You mean running out of filters?
PS4Deals,35tsno,acorsicanpimp,4,Wed May 13 22:57:36 2015 UTC,Why did you get three down votes? I don't understand reddit.
PS4Deals,35u0xs,BlaineDemont,3,Wed May 13 14:35:41 2015 UTC,Need more digital sales like this. Too bad it's always the same games on digital sales.

PS4Deals,35u7f2,qwd_lh,1 point,Wed May 13 15:27:40 2015 UTC,This can't be price matched by say Walmart or best buy can it?
PS4Deals,35u7f2,Fancypantz098,1 point,Wed May 13 15:56:58 2015 UTC,"No, Walmart does not honor EBay pricing or they would lose a lot of money. They don't accept 3rd party seller prices anyway, it would have to be sold through Sony or else the price could be rigged. It's how people were putting up ads for $90 PS4s on Amazon and then price matching it at Walmart."
PS4Deals,35u7f2,Iron_Jesus,1 point,Wed May 13 16:24:08 2015 UTC,Ya I heard about that. Is this better than the ps4 deal on frys? I would have sold the camera and maybe even battlefield to gamestop both having a trade in value of 30$ each
PS4Deals,35u7f2,Fancypantz098,1 point,Wed May 13 16:54:42 2015 UTC,"This seems like a pretty good deal. But I would like to wait for my paycheck on Friday. Is it likely that this kind of deal will come again soon before June? (Waiting for Arkham Knight release, already pre-ordered the game on it's own)  EDIT: Nevermind, this deal is 4 days long. I can wait."
PS4Deals,35u7f2,RaffNav,1 point,Wed May 13 19:41:31 2015 UTC,"Is there a possibility of being a warranty issue down the road? In my mind that's the biggest concern with this. I know they say it comes with the 1yr manufacturer's warranty, but... I'm still a bit sketched out.  Considering eBay/PayPal's track record with disputes/issues that aren't obvious ""rocks in box"" or ""inadequately padded, now broke to shit"" I'm not confident they'd help if it fails to power on 8 months down the road."
PS4Deals,35ra9s,GetVladimir,2,Tue May 12 21:23:29 2015 UTC,It's the cheapest it's been on PSN store as far as I recall. You could probably get the physical copy cheaper.  I would probably wait for a GOTY edition or something similar :)
PS4Deals,35ra9s,ZombiesInAMall,2,Wed May 13 12:18:53 2015 UTC,"The deal is now dead, unfortunately. I was going to jump on the Digital Guardian Edition as it was also reduced from $90 to $60 but it seems as though they restored the original prices earlier today."
PS4Deals,35ra9s,simmarjit,1 point,Tue May 19 22:23:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the promo ended yesterday with the new drop. You might want to wait, it's bound to get a discount or GOTY edition :)"
PS4Deals,35ra9s,ronzon775,-1,Wed May 20 14:00:29 2015 UTC,Would you consider that cheap? Is the game any good? LOL
PS4Deals,35ra9s,SexeroniPizza,0,Wed May 13 04:25:00 2015 UTC,I seen the game go down to 20. I would consider it good if you like playing the same mission over and over again   Comment: Downvote me all you want but that is pretty much my experience of the game
PS4Deals,35pb9q,pizman30,3,Tue May 12 12:14:51 2015 UTC,I'd totally pay this price...if it included some of the DLC. Beat it on 360 and the original game just doesn't have the replayability for me.
PS4Deals,35pb9q,SSJ_JARVIS,1 point,Tue May 12 15:27:16 2015 UTC,"I'm in the exact same boat. I bought it on 360 and traded it back in about two weeks later.  Every time I see it go on sale I start to think ""Well thats low enough to buy it again!"" but it really isn't. Even the 1-20 content is pretty bland in my opinion :("
PS4Deals,35pb9q,FabulousPaul,2,Tue May 12 22:34:47 2015 UTC,Damn shipping is 4.98 and tax is $2. So only saving bucks over other retailers right now. And you have to wait to get it. Wal Mart is doing it for the same price.
PS4Deals,35pb9q,bradreputation,2,Tue May 12 15:34:45 2015 UTC,You can also go to best buy and they will price match Amazon if you don't want to deal with shipping.
PS4Deals,35pb9q,master_kilvin,2,Tue May 12 15:40:39 2015 UTC,"Don't forget you basically need to buy the expansions to experience all features of the game, the way they're doing things. So its more like $60."
PS4Deals,35pb9q,MapleHamwich,1 point,Tue May 12 16:23:28 2015 UTC,I just got a download for $25 at boxeddeal.
PS4Deals,35pb9q,ChicagoZephyrs,1 point,Wed May 13 08:54:35 2015 UTC,"Yea I picked it up for this price, then paid $35 for the DLC, so its like paying $64 for a game thats been out for months."
PS4Deals,35q870,JeNeSaisPasDeux,2,Tue May 12 16:47:21 2015 UTC,"Or it's $80 in stores with taxes, good lawd, why must I be forced to buy digital??? Although this game looks so sick and with so much to do and combat that actually looks fun and challenging, I'm really tempted to buy digital, arggghhh. EDIT: Pre-ordered it digital!"
PS4Deals,35q870,HanselsSoHotRightNow,1 point,Tue May 12 16:48:55 2015 UTC,It's still $70 where I live for the physical copy but I'm debating this. Do they let you pre-download it usually? I've never pre ordered digitally before
PS4Deals,35q870,ImThatGuyYouDontKnow,2,Tue May 12 18:27:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, they do allow you to predownload it. Is it $70 before or after tax? Because with digital, there is no tax in Canada."
PS4Deals,35q870,HanselsSoHotRightNow,1 point,Tue May 12 18:46:17 2015 UTC,"Good point yeah that's $70 pre tax but I only have GST, so about $73.50. But considering trade in or selling on kijiji, $10 extra for a physical copy could be worth it"
PS4Deals,35pb7o,pizman30,1 point,Tue May 12 12:14:11 2015 UTC,Still not cheap enough. Tell me when its 20.
PS4Deals,35pb7o,bane9907,1 point,Tue May 12 18:06:11 2015 UTC,It's twenty. Look at the gamefly sale.

PS4Deals,35lnco,Iron_Jesus,1 point,Mon May 11 17:07:24 2015 UTC,Are there any better bundles that you've seen lately? I just finished finals and I'm about to get this.
PS4Deals,35lnco,Iron_Jesus,1 point,Tue May 12 20:23:50 2015 UTC,Not that I know of right now. It's not a bad bundle if you plan on playing Destiny and the resell value of the camera if you don't want it is $25-30 which can get you another game or almost another controller.
PS4Deals,35lnco,i5ReaL,1 point,Tue May 12 20:42:52 2015 UTC,"I won't mind Destiny, aside from Bloodborne that's not too much that catches my attention."

PS4Deals,35mbmv,emor09,1 point,Tue May 12 13:56:43 2015 UTC,That's what I've been doing.  Within days of the draft new rosters were out. It's pretty consistent. Gameplay always has issues but that's true for every madden

PS4Deals,35k0bl,ForTheMotherLAN,2,Mon May 11 02:44:45 2015 UTC,"This is actually an awesome deal! I just bought it tonight. You save almost $100 on the ps4. That's more than an extra game, or two used games.  Edit: Just received it yesterday (May 15). Pretty fast I guess. It said originally it was going to take 2 weeks. The only thing is that the delivery guy just left the package on the front steps and left. Anybody could of just stolen it! I was so pissed. I just knew about it cause I checked the tracking number."

PS4Deals,35k0bl,ObliviousBerg,2,Mon May 11 14:47:01 2015 UTC,"I just had to create an account on indigo (free). Then there's a button for Visa Checkout. You just enter your visa. I used Visa Debit and it worked.   I think they're just trying to get more people using visa, that's why they give 20%. I had it ship to my house, but you can also choose to ship to chapters or indigo store. It was $7 something charge for shipping for me. Which is nothing compared to the discount your getting."

PS4Deals,35jb6x,Fjdijtsk,1 point,Mon May 11 01:39:16 2015 UTC,"Why did you hate it? If I've never played the series before, would I like it?"
PS4Deals,35jb6x,coltsmetsfan614,4,Mon May 11 02:12:23 2015 UTC,"Why I didn't:   Crappy animations, at least compared to in2. Frustrating enemy attacks. There's one that, no kidding, glues you to the ground for a second or two. Really, really cringey writing. There's a part that sounds like a 1960s anti-drug campaign. You're killing drug dealers just because they're drug dealers. Very inconsistent parkour/ world traversal. Eventually there's a power introduced that makes travel too fast and easy. Crushed blacks in certain areas. Some areas are pretty for sure, but some are so damn dark.  The special powers take control away from the player, interrupting gameplay just to show a crappy, canned animation. The powers in general were just very disappointing. I got physically stuck in the game-world several times. Like where I couldn't move. The protagonist is annoying and immature, though well acted because Troy Baker. The antagonist was so damn cheesy and her motivations for being such a jerk were non-existent. Really the whole game seems to have been written by high schoolers collaborating with a group of old dudes. It's bizarre how bad it is.   Would you like it? I have no idea. IMO most of the people who ""liked"" it were desperate for a good game since the PS4's catalog was lacking at first. With all the good games out now like Alien Isolation, Bloodborne, Dying Light, Wolfenstein, and the awesome indie lineup, it's really hard for me to say anything good about it. And I don't know about Canada deals, but I found it for $20 USD months ago."
PS4Deals,35jb6x,Fjdijtsk,2,Mon May 11 04:14:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for putting so much time into your response! I'm definitely rethinking my desire to get it. I've played and loved Bloodborne and Dying Light, and I have Wolfenstein in my back catalog right now. Maybe I'd get inFAMOUS for under $20, but probably not above that. You'd recommend Alien: Isolation? I've heard mixed things."
PS4Deals,35jb6x,coltsmetsfan614,1 point,Mon May 11 04:51:00 2015 UTC,"You're welcome! I've seen far too much praise for SS to let it get another good word.  And I can't recommend Alien enough; it's my favorite of 2014. As long as you're patient and have headphones or a speaker setup that gives you decent directional audio information, it's not bad at all. Contrary to what most people say, the alien can absolutely be learned. My last run I only died three or four times playing on Hard.  Also, don't be discouraged by the tutorial mission with the Irish guy. It's bad but the game only gets better.  Enjoy Wolfenstein! It's solid as a rock."
PS4Deals,35jb6x,Fjdijtsk,2,Mon May 11 05:26:21 2015 UTC,"I've watched gameplay for Alien, and it looks like something I'll probably grab when the price drops a little more. Do you have an opinion about Borderlands: The Handsome Collection? That's another game I've been considering."
PS4Deals,35jb6x,coltsmetsfan614,2,Mon May 11 18:01:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly don't know much about it. It's cell shaded FPS that relies on its humor and loot system. That's about the extent of my knowledge though I've heard the first game, which isn't included, is the series' stronger entry."
PS4Deals,35i9ah,KungFuGenius,5,Sun May 10 17:14:38 2015 UTC,Still too high.
PS4Deals,35i9ah,ActionFlank,7,Mon May 11 00:06:19 2015 UTC,"I'm just being salty about the conditions of the rerelease.  If you've never spent a dime on Dark2, this is the way to go."
PS4Deals,35i9ah,ActionFlank,2,Mon May 11 01:03:13 2015 UTC,"If you have never played it, it's well worth the price. For me, since I bought the PS3 version for 60, I'm  waiting until it to be 30 or less, mainly buying it for the DLC."
PS4Deals,35i9ah,Screamyahualica,2,Mon May 11 01:05:37 2015 UTC,I'd like to get it for $30.

PS4Deals,35i9ah,AdrunkGirlScout,2,Sun May 10 20:49:03 2015 UTC,I hope so because Walmart considers the website a whole different store and wouldn't price March a BF3 sale they had a couple years ago.  Not sure if things have changed though
PS4Deals,35i9ah,kilroyishere89,1 point,Sun May 10 17:21:47 2015 UTC,Things haven't changed. I tried to get WM to price-match that COD: AW deal from that one website that was posted here a while back(forget the name of the site) and one of the employees that was there when I asked if they price-matched said they didn't even price-match their own website.
PS4Deals,35i9ah,octones,1 point,Sun May 10 19:46:50 2015 UTC,They say that but they will price match their website if it is in stock to buy on their website. I've had several Walmart cashiers tell me they won't only to be overruled by their manager. It's in their rules stated here that they price match online in store - http://corporate.walmart.com/policies/our-online-price-match-policy

PS4Deals,35g9ni,GlutenTag,10,Sun May 10 01:43:56 2015 UTC,My wife got me a bundle system with the camera and it's pretty much useless. I'd love to do bowling or golfing and it's hard to believe it doesn't come with anything more than some boring robot activities.
PS4Deals,35g9ni,numeralCow,7,Sun May 10 04:20:23 2015 UTC,Is this worth the low price or just a useless thing? Specifically does it control Netflix or any apps using voice command?
PS4Deals,35g9ni,jakcoy7,7,Sun May 10 03:09:19 2015 UTC,"It's limited at best. We're talking about loading up games, apps and system operations with voice operation. The big sell for it is having PnP while livestreaming, and even that's a small percentage of PS4 gamers."
PS4Deals,35g9ni,BryanRK,0,Sun May 10 03:50:05 2015 UTC,Well it's possible that this will be the best deal you can have gotten by the time Morpheus comes out and they're going for $300 for the eye on ebay
PS4Deals,35g9ni,SrsSteel,1 point,Sun May 10 08:30:13 2015 UTC,"This. I recently bought one after reading it would be required for Morpheus. Mostly useless, as others have said.  One nice feature is the mic, though. If you're playing online with friends, you can use the camera mic and output the chat audio to the TV in lieu of headphones.   Also, it's somewhat superficial, but Alien: Isolation has a couple cool features involving the camera."
PS4Deals,35g9ni,colinrgeorge,8,Sun May 10 12:05:58 2015 UTC,I feel like when Morpheus comes out they'll surely have a bundle with the camera.
PS4Deals,35g9ni,shall_2,4,Sun May 10 13:52:14 2015 UTC,I'll just wait for the inevitable v2.0 that comes with morpheus.
PS4Deals,35g9ni,Mister_Potamus,6,Sun May 10 17:42:24 2015 UTC,"Should be $14.99.  I bought one at day one, used it once for 11 seconds."

PS4Deals,35ccnn,WolfgangvonWolfhaus,3,Fri May 8 23:11:33 2015 UTC,I have a $25 gift card to GameStop which I've been wanting to use for a while. Is this a good game to use it for?  I'm a fan of shooters but I would want a game that isn't too short to complete and offers a decent amount of replayability.  Does this game offer those?
PS4Deals,35ccnn,Dann610,2,Sat May 9 12:52:45 2015 UTC,"worth it IMO. Bought it full price when it first came out and exceeded expectation. May seem like a generic FPS on the surface, but it's so much more than that. Also, there is a branching pathway in the early story that you'll have to play again in order to see the alternate story."
PS4Deals,35ccnn,markzone110,1 point,Tue May 12 16:26:41 2015 UTC,I'd try to find it on clearance at Target. I picked it up for $11.
PS4Deals,35ccnn,True_Talent,1 point,Sat May 9 12:54:45 2015 UTC,those are all gone unless your fairly lucky my target usually has day one editions like 2 years later and rare consoles and even here in the sticks they are all sold out.
PS4Deals,35ccnn,agentmarcusq,2,Sat May 9 14:22:56 2015 UTC,There were 5 copies when I went in the other day. Doesn't hurt to try.
PS4Deals,35ccnn,True_Talent,2,Sat May 9 15:03:58 2015 UTC,"Definitely worth it. Great game, and The Old Blood just came out, the prequel to The New Order, so you'll have plenty of gameplay."

PS4Deals,35atjc,pancakesandhyrup,9,Fri May 8 15:37:32 2015 UTC,"I like how the picture on the card  clearly states that it's reg price is $49.99 (which is the standard 12 month price) but the seller listed the list price as $59.99 to make it seem like you're getting a better deal. You're saving $10 buying it from the seller, not $20 and possibly less after taxes."
PS4Deals,35atjc,Deacalum,8,Fri May 8 19:27:41 2015 UTC,Why are they charging taxes if most shoppes don't for psn cards?? This seems like and error. Won't psn charge you again when entering the code?
PS4Deals,35atjc,RealSkyDiver,3,Fri May 8 17:18:23 2015 UTC,"It seems like it's based on your state. If you go to the ""Shipping and payments"" tab you can see the seller charges sales tax in multiple states, but not all of them."
PS4Deals,35atjc,x504xBEASTx,0,Fri May 8 18:08:46 2015 UTC,"No you're redeeming an item not cash.  The tax comes from the sellers state.  Some have them,  some don't. (State tax)"
PS4Deals,35atjc,RealSkyDiver,1 point,Fri May 8 18:17:03 2015 UTC,Then how come no stores such as BestBuy here charges taxes on it? It's like getting tax charged for gift cards which wouldn't make sense either.

PS4Deals,35atjc,Balizzm,5,Fri May 8 21:28:10 2015 UTC,"No,  there is $17 in shipping.  It's a rip off."

PS4Deals,35atjc,pr0adam,5,Fri May 8 21:56:28 2015 UTC,I see what you mean but your original comment was worded ambiguously and hence the down votes.

PS4Deals,35atcv,adigaforever,5,Fri May 8 22:10:59 2015 UTC,"This looks like the lowest price BoxedDeal has had for this title so far (previously was $25). Their site notes that the code received must be redeemed at https://www.playstation.com/en-us/inside-playstation/events/2014/ps4-4games1pick/ so be sure to read the page first so you know what to do.  Edit: This comes out to about $25 CAD so it's a pretty solid deal for Canadians as well since the game, even on sale, has never been below $40 as far as I can tell. Also, no tax."
PS4Deals,35atcv,pr0adam,3,Fri May 8 15:37:32 2015 UTC,So couldn't you just get the other choices for $20 as well?
PS4Deals,35atcv,hoffmanbrm,2,Fri May 8 17:09:22 2015 UTC,"You will receive a redeemable code delivered by email. Once redeemed the system  will allow you to pick one game out of the 4 available, you will be required to pick Little Big Planet 3. If you pick the wrong game during selection, we will not be resposible for your error.    Seems strange. I wonder why it would error."
PS4Deals,35atcv,pr0adam,1 point,Fri May 8 17:22:37 2015 UTC,I think they use the word error in that case as the person makes the mistake of not buying LBP3 and will then try and get a refund because they misclicked and bought destiny for example.
PS4Deals,35atcv,hoffmanbrm,3,Fri May 8 17:28:30 2015 UTC,"That makes sense if I reread it with that in mind. Thank you. I may go for Destiny at that price then. If I do end up buying it (rather poor, atm) I will update to let everyone know if it works."
PS4Deals,35atcv,pr0adam,2,Fri May 8 17:31:13 2015 UTC,"I was thinking that as well. You could probably buy LBP for $20 and then use the code to get Far Cry 4 or one of the other titles instead. No idea if that would work, but I suspect it would."
PS4Deals,35atcv,paulmgm,1 point,Fri May 8 17:35:56 2015 UTC,"I was thinking of doing that for FC4 but there is the complete edition coming out soon apparently. I have no idea how good the Dlc is for that game, though."
PS4Deals,35atcv,paulmgm,1 point,Fri May 8 17:45:45 2015 UTC,"A couple of friends who have the DLC said it was sort of meh. The main game is a lot of fun though.  If you can get the main game for $20 that's a pretty good deal, and if you wanted the DLC at some point in the future you could wait for a PSN sale or something like that. Odds are that would be cheaper than whatever they might price the complete edition at."

I've always felt that the camera is right at Amanda's eye level, so you might just have to get used to Sevastopol's claustrophobic environments. There are some LOW ceilings.

PS4Deals,358ssi,mahjongg,2,Fri May 8 06:30:13 2015 UTC,"It's basically the guts of a Vita made for you to plug into a TV.  You can stream PS4 games to it, but need a strong (preferably wired) fast connection to do so.  Otherwise, you can play some but not all vita games and psclassics on it.  I got one as part of the best buy bundle a while back, and use it in my bedroom on the secondary TV to play final fantasy, rogue legacy, race the sun, from bed.  I wouldn't buy one on it's own, especially since Sony doesn't seem super interested in supporting them, but it's not a bad little bonus as part of a deal."
PS4Deals,358ssi,Prisoner-2460_1,1 point,Fri May 8 07:14:43 2015 UTC,ah thank you! So I probably shouldn't even risk it as the streaming ps4 games would be the only use case for me :/

For some reason, the site really wants to navigate to the Xbox One version and stubbornly stays on it even if you click PS4, so you may need to specifically search for the PS4 version to get to it."
PS4Deals,3569z8,OneLuckyContestant,-1,Mon May 11 17:45:59 2015 UTC,It says its $19.99?
PS4Deals,3569z8,GEARHEADGus,1 point,Thu May 7 21:39:23 2015 UTC,"Because you have to buy ""Old Blood"" for $19.99 first, then you get the $15 off ""New Order."" But I'm pretty sure you can find New Order for less than $45, so I don't really think this is a good deal. Nevermind, they have New order for $24.99, so I guess it is worth it."
PS4Deals,3569z8,geoff422,-7,Thu May 7 21:59:20 2015 UTC,I already own the New Order
PS4Deals,3569z8,GEARHEADGus,-9,Thu May 7 22:10:09 2015 UTC,Too bad they hate money. Could have remade Enemy Territory!
PS4Deals,354so2,RockTheShaz,6,Thu May 7 02:40:35 2015 UTC,"Great deal. This is how much I paid for the used game off Craigslist, and I'd definitely say it's worth it."
PS4Deals,354so2,coltsmetsfan614,6,Thu May 7 05:42:39 2015 UTC,Yeah $40 is a great  price  for this  game
PS4Deals,354so2,seandan317,5,Thu May 7 11:56:27 2015 UTC,Whoever has not bought this game yet needs to do it right now. This is the best game that I have played this whole year.
PS4Deals,354so2,RollingThunderQ,4,Thu May 7 14:08:22 2015 UTC,"Decent deal, but I think it's worth $30 max."
PS4Deals,354so2,youdismantleme,3,Thu May 7 13:21:38 2015 UTC,There's 2 type of people. You and the guy with top comment. Idk who to listen to
PS4Deals,354so2,lapride7,1 point,Sun May 10 23:03:13 2015 UTC,I'm torn between this and Blood Bourne as my next big game to dive into (put lots of hours into).
PS4Deals,354so2,narzule,2,Thu May 7 17:52:44 2015 UTC,"If you want an actual challange, buy bloodborne."
PS4Deals,354so2,Kenya151,1 point,Sun May 10 03:33:10 2015 UTC,"Bloodborne isnt as good as the hype around it says. Those guys are diehard souls series players. The 30fps really sucks IMO and i serioisly wished it was 60fps. The combat is really good, but you find yourself having to grind alot to level up and in the beginning the game may be frustrating to play. Also your armor doesnt really do much, its more about your level and your skill at dodging/parrying. Nonetheless its still a very good game i just think it could be better with 60fps but i understand how its not easy to implement. BTW co op is so much fun! Very exhillerating when you clear through a new area with randoms/friends but is also fun to clear through an area you already have beaten and help others who are having trouble. The community is very nice, have always gotten messages saying ""Good work or thanks for the help"" after coop.  I have not played Dying light but my friends say its a fun game but very glitchy sometimes. Sorry about that. I would assume BB would have more content though"
PS4Deals,354so2,ExOTiC1234,3,Fri May 8 00:30:33 2015 UTC,"To put in another perspective, I'm not a diehard souls fan and I think Bloodborne is absolutely worthy of all the hype. It's an incredibly fun game, and I recommend it to anyone who isn't afraid of putting a little challenge into their gaming lives."
PS4Deals,354so2,SlightlyOffensive,0,Fri May 8 17:55:39 2015 UTC,I appreciate opinions in favor of it. I think it's a piece of shit. Tomato potato.
PS4Deals,3529da,roastpork,3,Wed May 6 14:32:07 2015 UTC,"I've been debating picking this up. I have a hell of a backlog on pretty much all my platforms.  Would this be a good price, or should I wait and see?"
PS4Deals,3529da,ForgedInFire,5,Wed May 6 18:13:53 2015 UTC,I bought it for $60 day one and have no regrets. It's a great game. Watch Angry Joe's review.
PS4Deals,3529da,anduin2000,3,Wed May 6 19:41:19 2015 UTC,"If you are not going to play it right away, just wait for it to drop more.  I'll probably hit $20 within a few months.  That's my sweet spot for gaming."
PS4Deals,3529da,systemlord,2,Wed May 6 20:34:14 2015 UTC,"If you're a fan of the original Alien and enjoy a bit of a challenge, it is totally worth 24 bucks."
PS4Deals,3529da,eggerWiggin,2,Wed May 6 19:18:00 2015 UTC,"A friend and I managed to beat it in 5-6 sittings. Overall, I'd say it was pretty fun. Good tense/scary moments and some decent gameplay. Only complaints are the missions where you walk in a spacesuit. Very lackluster and boring/slow, but there are only like two-three instances of this. (Although one of them is pretty neat if you're a fan of the movies.)  If you have a backlog and aren't in a rush, i honestly think this game might be cheaper in the future anyway."
PS4Deals,3529da,junyah54,1 point,Wed May 6 19:25:29 2015 UTC,"It's at 19,99€ in the EU Store, don't know about US though."

PS4Deals,3529da,swotam,-12,Thu May 7 16:55:55 2015 UTC,Look like a bad game it got a 6/10 on IGN
PS4Deals,3529da,ronzon775,8,Wed May 6 18:56:48 2015 UTC,"I don't understand that review, the game is great. Don't form a full opinion on just a number man"
PS4Deals,3529da,FoxK56,6,Thu May 7 01:39:56 2015 UTC,Who cares what IGN gave it lmfao. It's a fantastic game.
PS4Deals,3529da,FictionaI,-3,Thu May 7 06:10:32 2015 UTC,Anyone wanna let me borrow their gcu account so I can order it online?
PS4Deals,3501ya,Tiafves,3,Tue May 5 23:52:49 2015 UTC,"The ""U"" stands for ""Unlocked,"" right? Which means you can't get the free version of the membership to get this deal?"
PS4Deals,3501ya,rmill3r,2,Wed May 6 16:23:06 2015 UTC,"No. The Paid for version is $30 though, and honestly considering how long it's been that price there's no reason not to have it already. It pays for itself in 3 games (at about $12(20%) off new game releases, and even more for collector's editions like Batman Arkham Knight and the Witcher 3.   Not trying to shill since I honestly can't find a better membership program anywhere else and folks seem to have some aversion to bestbuy for some reason."
PS4Deals,3501ya,livefromwonderland,2,Wed May 6 16:58:53 2015 UTC,"True. I recently got the gamestop powerup membership though, so I think I'm gonna go with their $39.99 deal at the end of the month instead.   Witcher 3 collector's edition sounds tasty though..."
PS4Deals,3501ya,rmill3r,2,Wed May 6 17:22:30 2015 UTC,GCU is a much better deal than gamestop powerup. Totally worth the $30.
PS4Deals,3501ya,dunger,1 point,Wed May 6 17:46:17 2015 UTC,"Might be, but I already signed up for it :/"
PS4Deals,3501ya,rmill3r,0,Wed May 6 18:21:30 2015 UTC,That's a shame.
PS4Deals,3501ya,livefromwonderland,1 point,Wed May 6 18:44:19 2015 UTC,"I wanted to buy it last time I went to Best Buy, but price comparing with Amazon.com was actually more worth it. sadly."
PS4Deals,3501ya,BRUTALLEEHONEST,1 point,Wed May 6 20:36:49 2015 UTC,I don't see how but okay do what you like.   Edit: Don't get the downvotes. It's $54.99 at Amazon right now. It's $40 from BB with GCU. If that math somehow works out better for you if you price match Amazon then I'm not seeing it. It's $14.99 less.
PS4Deals,3501ya,livefromwonderland,2,Thu May 7 02:50:26 2015 UTC,Sweet! In for 1 and used my reward certificates to get it down to $20.  Thanks OP!
PS4Deals,3501ya,TupacHologram,1 point,Thu May 7 16:18:12 2015 UTC,Thanks. Bought it. Been waiting for it to hit $40.

PS4Deals,3501ya,nb00288,2,Fri May 8 19:12:12 2015 UTC,I bought it yesterday. RTTS is great.
PS4Deals,3501ya,Brutish,1 point,Fri May 8 19:36:32 2015 UTC,I've been caught up in DD in 2015 but RTTS is still one of the best game modes ever.
PS4Deals,3501ya,nb00288,2,Fri May 8 19:41:36 2015 UTC,I dont follow baseball so I do not know how I would do in DD.
PS4Deals,3501ya,Brutish,1 point,Fri May 8 19:48:26 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you mean? Playing DD is pretty much collect cards, create team, face other people in exhibition games. Your rank and division fluctuate with your skill level so you should really only be facing people who have as much of a grasp on The Show as you do."
PS4Deals,3501ya,nb00288,2,Fri May 8 20:09:31 2015 UTC,"I mean knowing who is good, and trying to get those players."

PS4Deals,3501ya,GatorGooch,1 point,Sat May 9 04:28:24 2015 UTC,Yep just bought it few hours ago.  I was unsure if I buy it online then pickup instore but found out go to the store and they will pricematch the website.
PS4Deals,34yz5v,Pizzamanstan,2,Tue May 5 18:53:30 2015 UTC,Has anyone used this site before/is it legit?
PS4Deals,34yz5v,Saaen24,4,Tue May 5 20:28:51 2015 UTC,"I found this deal from slickdeals. But I purchased one, and it worked fine. I was waiting around for awhile for an email, but if you buy make sure you check inside of your account, you download the code there."
PS4Deals,34yz5v,RockstarGTA6,3,Tue May 5 20:34:35 2015 UTC,gamedailydeals has it for $12 and is legit
PS4Deals,34yz5v,jBURRd,2,Wed May 6 00:49:20 2015 UTC,Can confirm. Used this site last week and have been loving The Last of Us.
PS4Deals,34yz5v,ExtraterrestrialTwat,2,Wed May 6 05:38:03 2015 UTC,"I've used a gray site like it, the codes are legit, although the way they obtain the codes may not be legit. I read somewhere that they use stolen credit cards or take advantage of deals and price variations in other countries. Some say they have had their codes taken away from them, but the one game I bought hasn't been taken away and its been months. So you should be good to buy it, plus 12 dollars isn't bad. I just wouldn't spend more than 40 dollars on these sites just in case."
PS4Deals,34yz5v,Saaen24,1 point,Tue May 5 20:36:56 2015 UTC,Alright cool thanks guys!
PS4Deals,34yz5v,ExtraterrestrialTwat,1 point,Tue May 5 20:39:06 2015 UTC,"I think you are talking mostly about russian keys. They get recalled on steam/origin, etc. Pretty sure all of these last of us games come from the bundled PS4 combos... Someone somewhere is moving some massive ps4s."
PS4Deals,34yz5v,WTFAlex,1 point,Tue May 5 21:43:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, what I read most of the keys that were being spoke of were Russian keys because people also accidentally ended up with games where everything was in russian. But yeah, I agree with you on that plausible theory of these games."

PS4Deals,34yz5v,SharkRobotStore,1 point,Thu May 7 18:08:03 2015 UTC,"They aren't selling digital delivery in terms like steam, where you buy the game, and then download it. These are more like prepaid card/codes that you see at gamestop, only a digital download code -  they need to be bought, and have a quantity, etc. I hope that made sense.   Edit: They appear to have it in stock still. So you should be in luck."
PS4Deals,34yz5v,Buntorar,1 point,Thu May 7 22:16:10 2015 UTC,Somehow I saw this just now. Yea it makes sense. Saw it was still in Stock so I copped one 😊  They literally sent me a PDF of the instructions with the code on the bottom lmao. Can't wait to play this after finals
PS4Deals,34z4hm,hamburgersandfries,2,Tue May 5 19:32:46 2015 UTC,Is this a good deal? Played a bit of dark souls and was thinking of just getting Blood Bourne for around the same price as this.
PS4Deals,34z4hm,narzule,6,Wed May 6 02:38:44 2015 UTC,"ive already got the platinum in bloodborne so this is my only choice.  if i hadn't played either, id choose bloodborne in a second"
PS4Deals,34z4hm,x504xBEASTx,1 point,Wed May 6 03:21:00 2015 UTC,I new to this series but I'd 100% recommend BB. Bought my ps4 because of it and I'm not disappointed at all. I'm personally waiting for ds2 to be $30 since BB is so good.
PS4Deals,34z4hm,narzule,1 point,Wed May 6 10:39:58 2015 UTC,Yeah that's what I'm kinda waiting for too. God I still need to beat DS1. Still stuck at Quelaag. So I kinda want to hold off on DS2 until I get back into the first. But BB is a new unique storyline right? Or is it based off of the dark souls series?
PS4Deals,34z4hm,systemlord,2,Wed May 6 13:39:36 2015 UTC,BB is spiritual sequel. Story is completely new and unrelated to any DS game.  Although many of the mechanics and gameplay are very similar.
PS4Deals,34z4hm,WordfromKirb,1 point,Wed May 6 15:37:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly, one makes me want to play the other. I lean more towards dark souls just because I have a lot more fun with everything it has to offer. Builds, covenants, all kinds of awesome weapons, way more than what bloodborne offers. Bloodborne is a bit easier and less versatile than ds2, not that it's a bad thing, just depends on a players preference."

PS4Deals,34ylx7,TheGumYouLike,2,Tue May 5 19:25:03 2015 UTC,"Yep. They even include any Online Pass or redeemable DLC when buying used. (At least, they have every time I've ordered a game that had a an online pass or DLC code).  EDIT: a word."
PS4Deals,34ylx7,AlonzoMoseley,2,Tue May 5 19:48:02 2015 UTC,"I got a pretty shitty copy of LA Noire back in the day. Maybe it depends on how popular the game was and how much use it received before. Probably not that many people rented Evil Within, so they could be mint."
PS4Deals,34ylx7,Pizzamanstan,5,Wed May 6 14:40:06 2015 UTC,I wish one of the online sellers would get this game in as a download code cheap.
PS4Deals,34ylx7,Adampro123,2,Tue May 5 19:21:33 2015 UTC,Thanks I've been looking for a cheap opportunity to buy this. Never had any issue with gamefly.
PS4Deals,34ylx7,Mattg082,2,Tue May 5 18:16:31 2015 UTC,"I got it for 20 bucks during christmas. Played maybe 6hrs...i really like this genre too, but it was a kind of ugly game with frame issues, camera angles bothered me and it was kind of a chore. I just didnt feel inspired to keep going. Traded it in towards mkx and also picked up bloodborne which is the best game regardless of what system its on! Id say 12 bucks ain't bad if you wanna try it. I did regardless of what people said and truly wanted to love it but collected dust. Got 10 at bb for trade in. Id say go for it if you have no back log and want a challenge on a weekend. Theirs just so many other good games. I enjoyed re5 more and thought well i like re4 and tlou what could go wrong egh"

PS4Deals,34z6an,molcomtitman,2,Tue May 5 19:46:30 2015 UTC,"Also saw same deal on Walmart.com. basically getting a extra controller for 9.99, so it's kinda like paying 360-ish for just the PS4 bundle. Just started looking for deals the past few days, would ya'll consider this a pretty good deal or is it very common?"
PS4Deals,34z6an,DivinoAG,2,Tue May 5 19:47:02 2015 UTC,"I actually got that Walmart deal last week when it was only $399. It was not as good as another I saw like a month ago (TLOU Bundle + Controller + 2 games), but still pretty good."
PS4Deals,34z6an,DivinoAG,1 point,Wed May 6 02:08:26 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about going through walmart but the deal seems to be online only and on the website it said it would take a week+ to get shipped to the store near me, i would rather support amazon than walmart if i have to have it shipped."
PS4Deals,34z6an,FrostedNut,1 point,Wed May 6 13:35:30 2015 UTC,"I can relate to that. I should note however that I made the purchase last Thursday April 30, and despite Walmart saying that the predicted arrival was today, the item actually arrived last Saturday, two days after purchase. I live in Fresno, not far from the warehouse in Sacramento."
PS4Deals,34z6an,aperks,1 point,Wed May 6 16:18:52 2015 UTC,"I think this type of deal is pretty common;  consider E3 is coming up soon and the possibility of a price drop.  I also daw there was an awesome deal from dell that bundled a ps4, sony headset, 3 months of ps+ and $100 gift card for $400.  I missed out on this deal.  Im going to wait just a bit longer."
PS4Deals,34z6an,fire_fox_,1 point,Wed May 6 01:27:01 2015 UTC,"Saw that dell deal but it kinda seemed like they messed up with that bundle, heard reports that the gift card wasn't given to some who had ordered it. Probably gunna pull the trigger on this at the end of the week if nothing better comes along by then; my PS3 just YLOD a week ago and i've grown bored of playing my old n64 already lol."
PS4Deals,34z6an,burner46,1 point,Wed May 6 13:31:44 2015 UTC,Does anyone know if Amazon allows large purchases to be split into multiple payments? I think I remember one of the PS4 bundles (PS4+Bloodborne) having some special financing offer where you qualify and you can pay over 6 months. As a college student it wouldn't be ideal for me to pay all $410 up front but I really want a PS4!

PS4Deals,34tmhp,ElSigma,16,Mon May 4 13:39:07 2015 UTC,If you need to make monthly payments on a video game console you probably shouldn't be buying a video game console
PS4Deals,34tmhp,RockTheShaz,12,Mon May 4 17:27:26 2015 UTC,"You don't have to need to do it, but it's certainly better on your wallet than dropping 400€ all at once.   I bought mine in a similar promo they had last year for 16€/month, and it allowed me to buy other things I needed more and still have a new Gen console.   For college students like me it's perfect, this has no additional fees or whatever, in the end you'll still be paying the 400€."
PS4Deals,34tmhp,Regithiel,0,Mon May 4 20:50:46 2015 UTC,Is that true? I can't read Portuguese but I assume this is the same as leasing vs financing a car but on a smaller scale.
PS4Deals,34tmhp,BeesPhD,1 point,Mon May 4 23:16:48 2015 UTC,Yup. This is technically financing by the retailer that sells you the console but I figure Sony must be covering the interest fees because there's none of that.
PS4Deals,34tmhp,Regithiel,1 point,Tue May 5 05:20:12 2015 UTC,"I'm Sweden something electronic sellers offer up to 60 month credit with no fees and interest. Works four them since they sell things ppl otherwise couldn't afford so I doubt Sony takes the interest. I just think Portuguese retailers realised they can sell many ps4 this way, considering the financial crisis I'm Portugal"
PS4Deals,34tmhp,TehChels,1 point,Tue May 5 17:01:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, I guess. It's interesting because it has only been done with a product like the PS4 here, no other product has ever had a credit option with no interest fees on offer, afaik."
PS4Deals,34tmhp,Regithiel,1 point,Tue May 5 17:03:09 2015 UTC,Bestbuy does this with anything you purchase (if you have their credit card). I bought my laptop this way.
PS4Deals,34tmhp,dehli,1 point,Tue May 5 21:49:46 2015 UTC,Yeah but doesn't having their credit card imply additional fees you have to pay to Best Buy?
PS4Deals,34tmhp,Regithiel,1 point,Tue May 5 23:42:10 2015 UTC,Nope! As long as you pay it off within the 12 months (or 18 if it's pricier) then you don't pay anything extra.
PS4Deals,34tmhp,dehli,-5,Wed May 6 00:47:16 2015 UTC,You could always just get a CC.....
PS4Deals,34tmhp,usc886,3,Mon May 4 23:16:56 2015 UTC,Yeah because the credit cards don't have fees if you don't pay the entire balance upfront.
PS4Deals,34tmhp,ImThatGuyYouDontKnow,4,Tue May 5 01:14:46 2015 UTC,I bought a $2000 telescope on one using the 0% introductory rate and paid it off before any interest accrued. There are some decent uses for debt if you have the dicipline.
PS4Deals,34tmhp,SynMonger,1 point,Tue May 5 03:27:42 2015 UTC,But this doesn't involve any hassles or contracts beyond of what you settle with with the retailer for the payments. Besides that would involve additional fees.
PS4Deals,34tmhp,Regithiel,1 point,Tue May 5 05:18:27 2015 UTC,They´ve had the same deal last year on the ps4 from Sony Spain. You just need to check if you can get some bundle cheaper nowadays.
PS4Deals,34tmhp,wohlstand,1 point,Tue May 5 08:02:12 2015 UTC,$$$ Best deal ever!

PS4Deals,34q9fc,Skelltor95,2,Sun May 3 16:32:44 2015 UTC,"Anyone have any insight as to how this game differs from the other Lego games? I bought Lego Marvel to play with my nephew but it's fun enough that my buddies and I will play it when we have nothing else to do, so I'm interested in getting this but if it's essentially the same thing I'll probably wait till it's $20 or less."
PS4Deals,34q9fc,Bruskthetusk,1 point,Tue May 5 15:48:35 2015 UTC,I preferred this game to Lego Marvel. Going to be unhelpful and say I'm not really sure why. They use the same formulae as all their Lego games. The main level you play in story mode then you can go back in free play. Plus a few games for in general free play mode.  I did like how you can be multiple types of batman ie. They powers he has depends on which suit he is wearing (which you can easily switch to).
PS4Deals,34q9fc,flamingo44,2,Fri May 8 19:30:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for letting me know, that pretty much confirmed what I was expecting. Pretty sure I'm gonna wait till it drops in price or until I 100% Lego Marvel"

You can get any of it cheaper online (usually, unless it's the first week of release), and that doesn't support poor business practices (like paying 10% value for used games and then reselling them for $5 less than MSRP)."

Emailed and got this back today:  I apologize for the inconvenience caused as you do not qualify for the promotion, The promotion was from  Thursday, April 23, 2015 .3:00 PM CST,And your order was placed on the 04-24-15.  Funny thing is she didn't specify and end date/time so it's horseshit.  Hopefully when it shows up on Thursday I can call them and get an English speaker who can give me a better explanation and a full return."
PS4Deals,34pnzi,notacyborg,1 point,Wed May 6 01:40:07 2015 UTC,Will the games be digital or physical? And how can I do this in-store?
PS4Deals,34lcss,VolticWreckage,9,Sat May 2 04:21:44 2015 UTC,So worth it. Also like to point out I really like that coupon feature of the new app

PS4Deals,34lcss,Bruskthetusk,6,Sat May 2 13:28:24 2015 UTC,Yes. Bloodborne was my first From game and it really is a masterpiece.
PS4Deals,34lcss,anduin2000,3,Sat May 2 13:35:42 2015 UTC,Ditto. What a phenomenal game.
PS4Deals,34lcss,requieminadream,5,Sat May 2 21:32:49 2015 UTC,"It's fun. And it doesn't explain anything really, just drops you into the universe. You'll get mad, you'll replay a lot of the same sections, but then one magical time through everything will make sense and it's amazing. Try your best not to look up help (unless that's your thing) and try to just explore and enjoy. It really is a great game and probably the best on ps4 right now. Enjoy!"
PS4Deals,34lcss,medicatedmonkey,1 point,Sat May 2 14:18:39 2015 UTC,Technically it is more of a Soul's game then DaSII due to the presence of Miyizaki.

PS4Deals,34lcss,Broue,1 point,Sun May 3 02:47:52 2015 UTC,You can also look it up in the new GameStop App and show it to a store associate.  I don't know if it will work with EB games too.

PS4Deals,34k79e,Kyuuma,2,Sat May 2 20:27:53 2015 UTC,It was 18.99 they upped it.
PS4Deals,34k79e,Animedingo,3,Sun May 3 04:33:35 2015 UTC,"I got this game used from 99gamers for about $14, and I still feel like it was too much.   This game is atrociously bad, it's not buggy per say, it's just REALLY bad. It feels like a really shitty Assassin's Creed game but with fake stealth mechanics. Yes you can knock people out stealthily but levels aren't designed to be done stealthily.   The story is awful, nobody has any character except Aiden's sister. Clara is the most generic, personalityless character I've ever seen, and Aiden, fucking Aiden. We're supposed to feel bad for Aiden? He constantly screws over others for his own personal gain, this guy sucks. This game sucks."
PS4Deals,34k79e,Shrektococcus,1 point,Mon May 4 18:34:09 2015 UTC,"I know this is an old comment, but thanks for keeping it real. I paid $16 for WD, resold it for about the same amount, and it was still a disappointment. It's full of driving missions where you have to bump into the bad guy over and over because there's no other way to stop him, poorly designed levels with boring enemy placement, insta-fail stealth, no incentive to explore, the most repetitive mission structure, and such BORING missions. Like really? I'm supposed to look through this camera and watch these three dudes talk for five minutes? Is that this game's version of a cutscene?  Most people hated Aiden, but who cares when the game itself plays like a fucking museum exhibit. Good riddance."
PS4Deals,34k79e,Animedingo,2,Thu May 7 05:14:34 2015 UTC,"I just managed to finish the game today. This game is seriously garbage.   I initially said this game had fake stealth mechanics, but when I discovered the way over powered silencer pistol, stealth missions actually became tolerable, almost fun. Almost.   But you're expected to escape from enemies after nearly every chapter, but escaping is stupid. You either have to drive away fast enough to escape the police which is asinine, or you have to hide in a different car that you're currently running away in, and usually they find you really easily.   I just wrote a review of the game which is gonna be posted tomorrow. i knew this game was bad when I got it but I had no idea how bad it really was. it's going back immidiately on 99gamers"
PS4Deals,34k79e,Pinkman505,2,Thu May 7 05:22:18 2015 UTC,Still not worth it.
PS4Deals,34k79e,Bill_Brasky01,4,Sat May 2 02:44:17 2015 UTC,It sucks you're both getting down voted for a valid opinion (You and rabbitsayer). Upped to cancel out negs.
PS4Deals,34k79e,Pinkman505,0,Mon May 4 16:51:21 2015 UTC,"Its just reddit, it be nice if the people down voting didn't hide behind it and explain why the game deserved the opposite of what I said. Nothing anyone can do. If you want to give your money to ubisoft go right ahead. I on the other hand rather support publishers that arent screwing over the gamers and the developers. If anything go rent it and if you enjoy it then go buy it for 20."
PS4Deals,34k79e,hamburgersandfries,3,Mon May 4 17:39:11 2015 UTC,i disagree. this game is awesome and definitely worth it for that price.
PS4Deals,34k79e,coltsmetsfan614,2,Sat May 2 05:10:05 2015 UTC,Oh come off it. It's absolutely worth under $20.

PS4Deals,34e9pw,anduin2000,2,Thu Apr 30 20:43:34 2015 UTC,"Great game! Never has a game filled me with so much dread while playing it. Between the randomized AI pathing and the stellar atmosphere - death really did feel like it was around every corner.   I actually found it hard to marathon or play for long periods of time because I would be incredibly tense while I played.... But that's precisely what I loved about it.  Additionally, if you have a PS4 Camera, there are a couple of unique features. You can simply lean your head to look around corners (instead of holding a button and using the stick). But the cool, more immersive feature is that you can turn on the camera's microphone and have it listen in on you.... So if you make a noise, the Alien is likely to hear you. I've been wanting this feature in my survival horror for a while... Ever since I came across the feature on the original PS2 version of Manhunt.  Of course, that feature doesn't work so well if you have loud pets or children."
PS4Deals,34e9pw,TheGumYouLike,1 point,Thu Apr 30 19:20:17 2015 UTC,I'm torn on this... I know I'll either really love it or really hate it and it'll turn into a 10 minute play for me. I've heard so many good things though.
PS4Deals,34ae4w,IrishTheHobbit,6,Wed Apr 29 16:00:13 2015 UTC,Worth it? Haven't played it before.
PS4Deals,34ae4w,ET3RNA4,3,Wed Apr 29 16:13:52 2015 UTC,"Definitely worth a play through. The hacking is fun to play around with. Story is bland, but for $20 you'll get your money's worth."

PS4Deals,34ae4w,RockTheShaz,4,Fri May 1 02:59:57 2015 UTC,"Definitely worth $20, I spent about two or three weeks playing through the story and very much enjoyed it; however once I finished the story I wasn't quite enthralled enough with the gameplay to get all the collectables, so in my mind it rates a solid 7.5/10"

I played WD on the 360, completed ~40% of the story, and had a decent time. So decent, in fact, I bought it for PS4 for $20 from Amazon a few months ago. Yeah, it’s in my backlog but I will revisit it."

PS4Deals,348d6t,Markdor,6,Wed Apr 29 02:39:55 2015 UTC,Is the game worth it?
PS4Deals,348d6t,Secret_of_Mana,4,Wed Apr 29 04:10:49 2015 UTC,I would like to know as well. I have been really turned off by the series after III.
PS4Deals,348d6t,Maximus_Realius,4,Wed Apr 29 05:00:36 2015 UTC,"I dug it. No more free running glitches than any other AC title. A little frame rate drop when you're in huge crowds. The story isn't that great. But Paris is amazing! So crazy to see so many people rioting and doing their thing. Main sequence assassination missions are reworked, and a lot more fun than they used to be. And co-op missions are fun as hell. First AC game I've played where the multiplayer is actually worth a damn.   All in all, at this price point, I'd say it's worth it. I payed $30 for it, and have gotten hours of entertainment out of it. Definitely worth it."
PS4Deals,348d6t,DoctorDank,3,Wed Apr 29 05:19:27 2015 UTC,I bought it on the last sale and I was disappointed. Glitchy and the freestyle running is frustrating. It's a toss up though because it can be fun.
PS4Deals,348d6t,Towelbit,1 point,Wed Apr 29 05:10:04 2015 UTC,"I really liked Black Flag, but after playing Shadow of Mordor and Dying Light, the free running in Unity wasn't as good and a little frustrating."
PS4Deals,348d6t,SenorV,1 point,Wed Apr 29 12:35:25 2015 UTC,Spot on. Why is free running so much harder in this one compared to the previous games? There are too many times where Arno just doesn't go where I want him to go. Plus the free running up and free running down mechanics don't work nearly as well as I am sure they intended.

They're is still a bit of lag when doing some co-op missions. Me personally, I hated the companion app, since they made it irrelevant, I found it quite entertaining. The dropped frame rate is almost solved. Only lasts a few seconds and that's it.   If that sounds like you can tolerate it, then it's worth it."

PS4Deals,348d6t,FullOppositeLock,1 point,Wed Apr 29 07:00:27 2015 UTC,"Definitely. Very solid game, won't blow your socks off but definitely a solid game"
PS4Deals,348d6t,FullOppositeLock,4,Wed Apr 29 15:39:17 2015 UTC,"Worth the price.   The fight mechanics are a redesign from black flag - makes fighting more difficult (which is a good thing)  Also, I like how there is more emphasis on stealth/sneaking.   I played this directly after beating black flag. The pirate ships got pretty stale about halfway into the game.   I enjoy this game a little more"
PS4Deals,348d6t,Chaotix247,2,Wed Apr 29 13:52:49 2015 UTC,How long is it compared to black flag?

PS4Deals,346kw4,narzule,7,Tue Apr 28 18:33:17 2015 UTC,"Cheapest I've seen them. Outside of black Friday deals ppl talk about. Get em while their hot!   Also, they work really well. No complaints. Just remember they AREN'T Bluetooth. It's USB."
PS4Deals,346kw4,philldo69,2,Tue Apr 28 21:04:00 2015 UTC,Does anyone know why this is the case ? I own the older PS Headset and I dont understand why they're not simply a bluetooth device.   There has to be a reason...
PS4Deals,346kw4,narzule,2,Tue Apr 28 21:08:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm not really sure. It takes up 1 of the 2 USB ports on the ps4 and I can't connect them to my phone to listen to music :( (wirelessly atleast, comes with a 5mm jack for a headphone input)"
PS4Deals,346kw4,AlonzoMoseley,3,Tue Apr 28 21:18:08 2015 UTC,"The PS4 is (short-sightedly) limited to 4 bluetooth channels, I believe. And they've reserved all four for the controllers, meaning headsets have to go via 2.4ghz radio, in other words sharing the congested wifi spectrum."
PS4Deals,346kw4,Bill_Brasky01,2,Tue Apr 28 22:54:16 2015 UTC,"Important note about 2.4Ghz spectrum. A strong wifi router can and will cause interference with these headphones. I had to relocate my Asus rt-n66u about 6 feet away before the problem disappeared.   Also, the usb dongle can be used in a PC wireless without installing any software. I frequently move the dongle between my PS4, PS3, and PC for use. Doing bluetooth pairing for all of those devices could be a huge pain."
PS4Deals,346kw4,PM_ME_YOUR_WIFEY,1 point,Mon May 4 16:56:37 2015 UTC,What kind of interferences?
PS4Deals,346kw4,Bill_Brasky01,1 point,Fri May 8 05:34:51 2015 UTC,"For me, the interference manifested as static, crackling and pop noises. I thought I had a faulty set, but then I did some research, moved my router, and all was right in the world. Just so you know, I had my router sitting underneath my couch. So the router was directly beneath me when I got the interference. Six feet to the right was enough to fix the problem (It's still under my couch)."
PS4Deals,346kw4,JPFresh,1 point,Fri May 8 14:52:17 2015 UTC,So they have to be plugged in at all times to work?
PS4Deals,346kw4,Bdoggy88,3,Tue Apr 28 21:50:16 2015 UTC,"No, they run through a bluetooth USB  dongle but they also include a 3mm headphone cable if you want to plug them in to something else."
PS4Deals,346kw4,Seth711,1 point,Tue Apr 28 22:18:47 2015 UTC,Do you know if they have to be charged for them to work with the headphone cable?
PS4Deals,346kw4,Bdoggy88,1 point,Fri May 1 20:39:37 2015 UTC,"No they don't have to be charged, they function just like any other headphones when they are plugged in via cable. Be aware that the buttons for muting, volume  ^ v don't work when you choose that method."
PS4Deals,346kw4,Seth711,1 point,Fri May 1 20:43:47 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks for the information. I might actually get these then."
PS4Deals,346kw4,narzule,4,Fri May 1 20:58:04 2015 UTC,Grabbed these.. Good price.
PS4Deals,346kw4,anh86,2,Tue Apr 28 22:49:44 2015 UTC,Has anyone figured out how the virtual surround sound on these work?
PS4Deals,346kw4,narzule,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:34:31 2015 UTC,There's a VSS (virtual surround sound) button on the headset that toggles it from 7.1 virtual surround to stereo. I don't even have my set yet (I took the free shipping) but you can clearly see that button in the press shots.
PS4Deals,346kw4,anh86,1 point,Fri May 1 13:54:32 2015 UTC,Yeah I have them and see the button. But I don't notice any difference in sound quality when I toggle it on/off. I wasn't sure if it had to be set up on the console or something. I'll check the manual that came with it and figure it out tonight.
PS4Deals,346kw4,narzule,1 point,Fri May 1 14:21:30 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't need to do anything special but keep in mind that it only works in wireless mode on PS3 and PS4 while you're playing a game. If you're playing music on console, using the headphones on a PC or through the wired cable, surround sound is not supported. It makes a big difference in games so you should be able to tell when it's on and off (I have the original Sony wireless headset, which also has 7.1). The sound is very flat in stereo mode and is much deeper and more three dimensional when you use the 7.1 surround. Things that are in front or behind you very clearly sound like they are coming from that direction."
PS4Deals,346kw4,narzule,1 point,Fri May 1 15:39:37 2015 UTC,Alright thanks for the info. I'll definitely check that out tonight.
PS4Deals,346kw4,anh86,1 point,Fri May 1 17:08:29 2015 UTC,"Hey man, turns out VSS does work on PC I think. Go to Sound in the control panel, then find the head phones, right click to properties, and under advanced you can turn on VSS and bass enhancer. I'm pretty sure I notice the difference now."
PS4Deals,346kw4,AlonzoMoseley,1 point,Mon May 11 01:25:08 2015 UTC,"Glad to hear it's working for you. It might depend on the type of sound hardware you have installed, but maybe not. I know they don't guarantee compatibility with every PC."
PS4Deals,346kw4,narzule,6,Mon May 11 01:51:26 2015 UTC,Good price. Disappointing headset.
PS4Deals,346kw4,AlonzoMoseley,2,Tue Apr 28 22:28:13 2015 UTC,"For the price, you can't really be to disappointed thought right? I've had them for a while and they get the job done. I also think the range is pretty solid. I can walk around my house with the headset on and still hear my comp upstairs. How far are you needing to be from your pc/Console lol."
PS4Deals,346kw4,narzule,3,Wed Apr 29 21:59:54 2015 UTC,"The price is good, I admitted that. I have about 12-15ft to the console. The signal is weak, though if you have little obstruction or interference you'll probably be ok. But often there is interference you can't control, and congestion is only getting worse. Ideally they should use Bluetooth, or at least allow you to select a channel."
PS4Deals,346kw4,akatsukix,2,Wed Apr 29 22:14:52 2015 UTC,Yeah it would be nice if the Bluetooth wasn't dedicated to the controllers. Having these headphones connect via Bluetooth with smart phones would be amazing also.
PS4Deals,346kw4,AlonzoMoseley,2,Wed Apr 29 22:33:46 2015 UTC,Why disappointed?
PS4Deals,346kw4,ManWithAPIan,2,Wed Apr 29 02:37:06 2015 UTC,"Sound is good, comfort is average, controls are average, signal strength is poor, and no flexibility to change channels or settings. Just my opinion. Others like it more."
PS4Deals,346kw4,AlonzoMoseley,2,Wed Apr 29 02:44:19 2015 UTC,I like how your not allowed to have an opinion on here anymore.

PS4Deals,346kw4,Turbokill,2,Tue Apr 28 22:24:30 2015 UTC,"I think some people have had success with the Turtle Beach Stealth 500p that has an optical cable that plugs from the dongle to the optical output at the back of the PS4, but I haven't any experience of them."
PS4Deals,346kw4,brando223,2,Tue Apr 28 22:56:44 2015 UTC,"In this price range, I chose the Golds over the PDP Afterglow model because they were slightly more comfortable and had the customizable game profiles.  But it was pretty close call."
PS4Deals,346kw4,anh86,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:09:04 2015 UTC,That's a great price. I just bought silver ones not too long ago too... :/
PS4Deals,346kw4,iUsedtoHadHerpes,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:56:56 2015 UTC,Best buy price matched. Thanks for sharing
PS4Deals,346kw4,Scum_Of-The_Earth,1 point,Fri May 1 11:16:31 2015 UTC,"I've been wanting these for a while but couldn't justify the purchase because I have the original style Sony wireless headset and they're identical for the most part. I still wanted these because I think they look a little better, they allow wired use for my Vita/phone, they fold down and come with a carrying case, the mic is built in rather than a boom that could break. It's just a few conveniences that would be nice. Once I saw that my original set in great condition (mine is) with the box (which I have) was selling for $50-$60 on eBay, I snapped this up. Great deal!  My original set also suffers from occasional disconnects that probably occur due to interference in the 2.4 GHz wifi spectrum. From some of the comments here, it sounds like this set is no different but hopefully it's a little better. It's extremely frustrating to lose connection a couple of times during ever 1-2 hour session. Not only that but sidetone is turned off when connection is restored so you have to wait until you're in a place where you can stop to toggle it back on. If this set isn't better, I'll just pick up a USB port extension cable which I have read helps a lot. I shouldn't have to do that but the price, sound and mic on these sets is great. It's worth it."
PS4Deals,346kw4,greengorilla60,1 point,Fri May 1 14:04:29 2015 UTC,Does anyone know how these compare to lower quality around-ear headphones like Beats? Do they sound as good or even worse than them?

PS4Deals,3456rs,ronzon775,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:56:46 2015 UTC,How much was shipping and tax?
PS4Deals,3456rs,anduin2000,3,Tue Apr 28 21:39:19 2015 UTC,$1.20 for tax. No shipping cost.
PS4Deals,3456rs,FelBanana17,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:17:00 2015 UTC,Any idea how long this will last?
PS4Deals,3456rs,SenorV,2,Tue Apr 28 15:14:37 2015 UTC,"No time limit, just until supplies last.  Popular games sell out quick with a price drop.  Alien was $15 for about a day last week and now it's back to $25."
PS4Deals,3456rs,SylvesterLundgren,2,Wed Apr 29 02:57:16 2015 UTC,Just grabbed a copy for $21.24 shipped.
PS4Deals,3456rs,hardangelfan,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:19:14 2015 UTC,This is rated 4.7 by its users... Geez
PS4Deals,3456rs,azane,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:42:50 2015 UTC,"It's fun for a couple hours, but it plays more like a minigame in some random shooter than a full game, and they also used the DLC system that ""free"" to play Games generally used, making it pretty nauseating to pay real money for it"
PS4Deals,3456rs,akeytoasafe,1 point,Tue May 5 17:31:44 2015 UTC,It's better than that. I got it full price and definitely got my money's worth. Pretty cool game.

PS4Deals,343q8y,matthewgoodnight,15,Tue Apr 28 01:41:06 2015 UTC,This game is 100% worth the price.
PS4Deals,343q8y,RollingThunderQ,5,Tue Apr 28 02:32:30 2015 UTC,Great game
PS4Deals,343q8y,G4mbit,4,Tue Apr 28 02:53:37 2015 UTC,I'm curious to know if anyone else got motion sick from this game. I tried it at a friend's house for 30 minutes and had to stop. Is there a breaking in period or am I better off not putting down money towards something I may not be able to play?
PS4Deals,343q8y,SuperBakaKing,3,Tue Apr 28 11:52:32 2015 UTC,"This is very interesting, and it hadn't even occurred to me that this might happen. I get pretty bad motion sickness, but this game didn't trigger it at all. If you've already experienced it though, it may not get any better for you. I'd recommend renting it before you buy it to check for a breaking in period."
PS4Deals,343q8y,coltsmetsfan614,1 point,Tue Apr 28 13:49:09 2015 UTC,"I found a friend who is going to let me borrow it to find out. I hope i can play, I've heard amazing things."
PS4Deals,343q8y,SuperBakaKing,3,Wed Apr 29 01:57:28 2015 UTC,"I'm glad to hear that! I've really enjoyed the game, and I hope you can, too!"
PS4Deals,343q8y,coltsmetsfan614,3,Wed Apr 29 02:25:36 2015 UTC,"I didn't, but I can totally understand.  The way the camera bobs and swings around can be very jarring even if you aren't prone to motion sickness."
PS4Deals,343q8y,OneLuckyContestant,0,Tue Apr 28 12:54:18 2015 UTC,"This happened to me the first little while playing the game. But, I eventually got over it. Hopefully you can too."
PS4Deals,343q8y,RollingThunderQ,4,Wed Apr 29 00:10:42 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking about picking this up tomorrow. I joined the GCU program yesterday, but have yet to use it!"
PS4Deals,343q8y,brandonopolis,2,Tue Apr 28 02:18:32 2015 UTC,"It's 46.99 at Amazon, so you can price match and save another 3 bucks."
PS4Deals,343q8y,nklim,1 point,Tue Apr 28 13:10:39 2015 UTC,Price Match doesn't stack with GCU discount unfortunately. It's one or the other.
PS4Deals,343q8y,DoubleUnderTheSun,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:01:12 2015 UTC,"Are you sure about that?   I was actually at Best Buy yesterday and asked the associate that question, and he said you can combine them. It seemed like too good of a deal for Best Buy so I rephrased it and asked him again and he gave me the same answer."
PS4Deals,343q8y,nklim,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:43:38 2015 UTC,I've tried it at two different best buys and in both cases they said GCU discount applies to the BB price and cannot stack with price match.  Sometimes you can get away with different things at different stores though. When radioshack had infamous second son for 9.99 online I found one store would price match and another wouldn't.   If you can get it then keep finding that same cashier! Haha
PS4Deals,343q8y,DoubleUnderTheSun,1 point,Tue Apr 28 18:04:29 2015 UTC,"Bummer. I don't actually have the card because I rarely buy brand new full-price games. If they don't price match, it's not really worth it to me because most of the time the amazon price matched game is probably still cheaper (or at least within $2 or $3) of the 20% off markdown.   He was a floor associate trying to sell me the card, so he might not have been knowledgeable on the actual sales policies up at the register. I don't think he was trying to trick me, he was just misinformed."
PS4Deals,343q8y,nklim,1 point,Tue Apr 28 19:42:22 2015 UTC,I've found its worth the 30 already for me.  For example.. Traded in Dragon Age Inquisition valued at 20 plus 30 percent bonus was 26..mortal kombat x with GCU discount from 60 down to 48 so I end up with MKX for $22.  With GCU I seem to be paying no more than 20-25 per new game with buying a new game every 3 to 4 weeks and trading in the old one. Sometimes I literally get back what I paid for it or more.
PS4Deals,343q8y,DoubleUnderTheSun,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:37:50 2015 UTC,[Canada] when I was at bestbuy the other day they said they didn't have GCU running yet. So I didn't get any  points.

PS4Deals,341pfq,batmanAPPROVED,1 point,Mon Apr 27 21:52:31 2015 UTC,Any real reason for this? I'm looking to get a PS4 for cheap-ish since I only have a few games I'm wanting on it at the moment and can't justify the $400 for one..
PS4Deals,341pfq,Flamesblade4,0,Tue Apr 28 21:42:21 2015 UTC,"In my experience, refurbished is just asking for a product that isn't going to last long. I've had 2 electronics that were, a TV and a PSP, both quit working way too soon. If wait dude, that's what I'm doing. The price is going to continue to get better and when I find the right sale later this year, I'll bite"

The warning about picking the correct game leads me to believe that's the case. I'm thinking of buying the Destiny key then selecting Far Cry to save a few more dollars.

PS4Deals,33yicc,BlitzKraig1,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:24:36 2015 UTC,"I bought this due to your recommendation, thanks for the heads up, but I probably should have asked before purchasing; does gat out of hell work with the pre owned game? Or is it a one-time download code and will I probably not get it from gamefly?"
PS4Deals,33yicc,Leeeoon,2,Mon Apr 27 18:28:23 2015 UTC,"From my experience, purchasing used games from GameFly ALWAYS came with a voucher of some sort. An example would be when I purchased a used LA Noire, and the vouchers for extra missions worked.  I'm sure you can contact customer support claiming that the product was not as advertised as it states: ""The single-use voucher is only included with purchase of the game."" As far as I know, a used game is still a purchase, and it can be interpreted as used games being included in that statement."

PS4Deals,33yicc,iSukz,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:32:08 2015 UTC,"I saw that on Gamefly and the Gat Out of Hell is a voucher, not a second physical copy. So I'm curious, even if I buy it used, will it come with a new voucher? Because the previous owner most likely already used said voucher.   The Gamefly page for the game looks like it's only advertising as Saints Row IV: Re-Elected.    NOTE: Rental of this title does not include the voucher for Saints Row: Gat out of Hell. The single-use voucher is only included with purchase of the game.   The disclaimer states that the voucher is included with purchase of the game but still does not provide enough clarification."

PS4Deals,33msno,pr0adam,10,Thu Apr 23 21:15:23 2015 UTC,Still very active.  I play all the time.  Better then all the COD games on ps4.
PS4Deals,33msno,NightRed_,3,Thu Apr 23 22:08:12 2015 UTC,Isn't there a need for premium Dlc to play with most of the community? Or do I have it all wrong?
PS4Deals,33msno,pr0adam,7,Thu Apr 23 22:31:12 2015 UTC,"I have premium, but I mostly play on the original maps. A major part of battlefield is learning the map."
PS4Deals,33msno,NightRed_,2,Fri Apr 24 01:36:48 2015 UTC,I would at least get second assault dlc.  That's the best one.  But premium is pretty cheap now.
PS4Deals,33msno,Bill_Brasky01,3,Fri Apr 24 02:09:57 2015 UTC,"Can you show where premium is still cheap? I missed the PSN sale in early January and have really been wanting to pick it up, but don't want to shell out $50. Thanks for the tip on second assault though."
PS4Deals,33msno,NightRed_,2,Mon Apr 27 16:14:26 2015 UTC,"Yea, I think the sale might of ended.  Sorry bro.  Eventually it will go back on sale.. Especially since Hardline is out now."

PS4Deals,33m6rb,DreadMcLaren,6,Thu Apr 23 17:30:26 2015 UTC,Perfect timing. I had $50 gift card expiring in May from a TV i bought from Dell. Got my controller with free shipping for a total of $2.99 and a  bonus $25 gift card .
PS4Deals,33m6rb,LibertyIsNotFree,5,Thu Apr 23 20:00:11 2015 UTC,"$25 Gift Card can take up to 20 days to receive via email and will expire within 90 days after being issued. Please keep this in mind when purchasing.  Edit: To add, Dell WILL price match Amazon, if you contact them, so that might influence your decision a little more."

PS4Deals,33m6rb,Friar_Faithful,2,Thu Apr 23 17:41:52 2015 UTC,Be warned I did this for the PS4 bundle just posted and the free 2 day shipping offer didn't pop up. I have been chatting with a Dell employee for over 30 minutes trying to get this fixed.
PS4Deals,33m6rb,Golden_Taint,2,Thu Apr 23 19:41:59 2015 UTC,"You have to sign up for Dell Advantage and then log in separately from your Dell login, it's kind of confusing. Once you're logged in to your Dell account and viewing your cart, there is a separate Advantage login in the upper left hand corner. After this second login where it asks for your second password, you'll see the 2 day shipping option. I've ordered from them three times and done this every time. Hope that helps!"

PS4Deals,33m6rb,11tybillion,-3,Thu Apr 23 18:52:37 2015 UTC,"Eh, so that means I buy the controller for $35 off retail and a game at full price?  Doesn't seem that great to me"

PS4Deals,33m6rb,11tybillion,-3,Thu Apr 23 20:08:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i guess my point is that it's not that strong of a deal on its own.  You need to find ANOTHER deal on your next purchase (on the dell site, which makes it harder) to make it really worthwhile if you are as scrupulous as me (i dont like to pay retail for anything)"
PS4Deals,33m6rb,m0ei,1 point,Thu Apr 23 20:21:51 2015 UTC,Or instead of a game you could use it to purchase a PS+ membership or PSN credit. You could also hold onto it and use it when another deal comes up.

PS4Deals,33n2p8,Inframidi,1 point,Fri Apr 24 02:38:49 2015 UTC,"And you should be skeptical. I just recently ran into some problems on Ebay via deals found on this subreddit. For one, Sony says the 'new' PS4 I bought (from Rakuten or Buy.com via ebay) is NOT under warranty. I'm currently trying to find out what Rakuten is going to do/say about it. My controller was slightly wonky and I was trying to get it repaired or replaced - Sony said ""no dice."""

Either way this whole thing has been a long journey, so although it was a bitching deal, this may be the last time I order from Dell.  Edit: Just to expand on it, I received a call from a customer service rep. on Monday to follow up on 1 of my previous emails and after talking for a few minutes he opened a case with the gift card department to process my request. I got a confirmation email from him shortly after that and there was no other communication until today that I got the gift card."

PS4Deals,33j3fo,brooklynapple,2,Sun Apr 26 17:40:31 2015 UTC,Are there restrictions on how the gift card can be used?  Can you use it to buy PS4 games?

PS4Deals,33j3fo,pr0adam,1 point,Thu Apr 23 12:17:02 2015 UTC,"Tight, very tight, and yeah they're wired to the console but the wire they give is long enough for it not to be annoying. The audio quality is very good (surround sound and all that good stuff). Both chat and game audio can go through the headset if you want and you can make one louder than the other anytime with the little remote thing that's attached to it."

PS4Deals,33j3fo,gamemaker14,1 point,Fri Apr 24 19:04:57 2015 UTC,"I'm very anxious to see how this turns out.... I purchased this warily because the deal was appearing and disappearing randomly on the site.  In the matter of two hours I watched the deal go from as listed, to missing the gift cards, back to the listed deal, then having the gift cards but missing the ps plus, then being out of stock, then being back as listed again.  After missing the Bloodborne Amazon PS4 deal, I didn't want to miss out so I purchased this when it went live again with the gift card and only missing the ps plus.  (Which I probably won't use anyway).    Because I'm paranoid, I did speak with customer service and they did tell me that I was eligible to receive the gift card, so I guess we just now wait and see.  Reading about Dell's poor customer service though, I'm wary if I'll actually get the gift cards (I purchased a controller too with $25 gift card promo), and I'm annoyed my order is still ""in production"" with a delivery date in late May.... Wtf Dell.  I just hope everything works out, and at least I have a transcript saying I'm supposed to receive the gift cards...   I would appreciate if anyone could update once they receive their order/gift card.  I'll honestly most likely return mine if I don't get the gift cards for whatever reason.... :/"
PS4Deals,33j3fo,Neff619,1 point,Fri Apr 24 19:46:28 2015 UTC,"Same, I have another unexpected delay and that I have to consent to continue with my order or I could also choose to cancel it. I hate it how they didn't even email me about the consent form and that I had to manually check my order status. If I hadn't checked my order status, my order would've been automatically cancelled without me even knowing. I'm currently on hold for chat support and to see if my order did come with the GC if not, I'm just going to cancel it, I don't need the headset anyways."

So they already started shipping them...no sign of the $100 gift card on the other hand which kinda sucks bc I have no interest whatsoever on the headset :\"
PS4Deals,33j3fo,chronichoosier,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:55:24 2015 UTC,"Damn, you're lucky haha. Mine was originally supposed to arrive tomorrow, then another delay happened. Now it's gonna be on 5/6 next wednesday :/. I'm trying to consent to proceed with the order but it's like glitching and keep coming back to the original page like nothing happened. Oh well, I'll see if I can call them tomorrow to see whats up and if it's worth proceeding with the order or just buying it in-store."
PS4Deals,33j3fo,Mighty_Hextic,1 point,Fri May 1 03:16:10 2015 UTC,"Meh... Mine is still ""In Production"" and I've received no updates.  It's been about 5 business days now since I've ordered.... The charge hasn't even been pushed through either.  I wonder if they are planning on canceling mine.... :<"
PS4Deals,33j3fo,OX-DEXTER-XO,1 point,Fri May 1 03:30:04 2015 UTC,"Same here actually, mine still says In Production. The only updates I've had so far are the two delays they have. With the 2nd delay, it says I have to consent to proceed with my order or cancelling it. Weird but okay lol. Although I've already been charged day off my order which was on the 4/24. Man, I swear if the GC isn't honored    Ima be pissed if I've waited almost 2 weeks for nothing but a headset...."

Long, but at least I got it. (I'm so spoiled by prime...)  Unfortunately though, I still haven't received my gift cards.  Anyone else get their gift cards yet?"
PS4Deals,33j3fo,gamemaker14,1 point,Fri May 1 04:11:56 2015 UTC,Dell chat rep said I'd have it by today at the latest (20 days from invoice). Just got a call from another rep saying now it will be an additional 3-5 more days. Just ridiculous.
PS4Deals,33j3fo,chronichoosier,1 point,Mon May 18 19:07:36 2015 UTC,"Ordered mine on the 24th as well. Have not received it. Emailed several times and never got a response from customer service. Finally, today I received one. Said that the promotion ended on the 23rd so my order didn't qualify. Fuck that. Just tried calling and was told to call back because some gift card machine was being updated. I am quite pissed at Dell right now."

PS4Deals,33hey1,Ajegwu,7,Wed Apr 22 15:25:20 2015 UTC,As far as I know this is only valid if you bought and activated your ESO before June 2014.  If this is incorrect I would love to be proven wrong as I would love to be able to transfer my character to PS4.
PS4Deals,33hey1,Volanir,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:06:06 2015 UTC,"You are correct.  I think everyone who is eligible received emails about the promotion.  You can check for eligibility by logging into the ESO site and checking the price on the PS4/Xbox One version.  If you are one of the lucky ones, it will be $20.  If not, it's full price."
PS4Deals,33hey1,OneLuckyContestant,2,Fri Apr 24 13:06:01 2015 UTC,Sounds awesome! Is it a copy or a transfer?  Do you get to still play on the PC version too? I don't want to start all over on PC if I do the transfer.
PS4Deals,33hey1,AnotherUselessPwn,2,Wed Apr 22 16:06:41 2015 UTC,"FAQ says copy, and any further progress with be separate."
PS4Deals,33hey1,wohlstand,2,Wed Apr 22 16:11:53 2015 UTC,"Does it mean you have to buy the game on PC or is there a way to just sign up somewhere, and get the discount?"
PS4Deals,33hey1,OneLuckyContestant,2,Wed Apr 22 18:55:13 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, this discount is only for those who bought the PC version early on.  I think the cutoff was some time in June 2014."
PS4Deals,33hey1,Rasa-MiL,2,Fri Apr 24 13:20:35 2015 UTC,Thank you I was looking for when this offer expired. Was scared it was over lol

PS4Deals,33hey1,OneLuckyContestant,1 point,Thu Apr 23 16:18:45 2015 UTC,"I doubt it.  You can check by signing into the ESO site and checking the price on the console edition.  If you are eligible, it will be $20 - no promo code or anything else required."
PS4Deals,33hey1,macaleese,2,Fri Apr 24 13:22:14 2015 UTC,"I'm still SUPER pissed off about this deal. I NEVER received an email so I didn't get to take advantage of the deal and contacted eso customer service and after a week of emails back and forth they told me there's nothing they can do for me. Even though I paid for the imperial edition on pc and want to transfer to ps4 for $20 I was told sorry nothing we can do, pay the full price for it again. Was very disappointed as I can't afford to buy it again at full price :("
PS4Deals,33hey1,beardlessdick,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:56:28 2015 UTC,"Does it give you a download code for the PS4 version or do you link your account to your PSN? Because of the former is true, there might be a lot of selling of unwanted download codes."

PS4Deals,33gz08,roastpork,6,Wed Apr 22 13:17:04 2015 UTC,"This is YMMV. I just wasted 20 minutes and got rejected at Target. It rings up $60 in store so you have to get a price match from Target online and use the cartwheel which requires a manager override. In the terms and conditions, you can't have both so you can easily be denied."
PS4Deals,33gz08,FictionaI,3,Wed Apr 22 17:09:44 2015 UTC,"That sucks.  Went very smooth for me. 10 mins in and out and they went through the online price match, then cartwheel app thing."
PS4Deals,33gz08,keeks518,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:08:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah the girl that got the game out of the glass case told me to expect this but to try anyway. I let the guy do the price match and then said ""oh yeah, I lve got this also"" and he scanned it without saying anything. Probably because I had a line of other people behind me."
PS4Deals,33gz08,Garrick75,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:13:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the report, I'll add it to the post. I was planning on heading to the store after work today so I wasn't aware that it was still $59.99 in stores. Seems strange that their price online would be so much lower.   I understand them not applying the discount on a price match from another retailer, but to deny it on their own price is odd."
PS4Deals,33gz08,FictionaI,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:17:21 2015 UTC,Yeah. They said that the store Targets use cartwheel to keep the price the same with their online outfit.
PS4Deals,33gz08,dylang5,2,Wed Apr 22 17:24:18 2015 UTC,Worked like a charm!!! The manager even pulled out his phone to scan the Cartwheel barcode because mine wouldn't load. Thanks for this deal!
PS4Deals,33gz08,anduin2000,2,Wed Apr 22 21:30:35 2015 UTC,Success story checking in. Had to go to guest services and the girl asked her manager if online price matching can stack with the cartwheel app and he said yes. Thanks for the heads up!
PS4Deals,33gz08,kronzillatron,2,Wed Apr 22 21:46:22 2015 UTC,"No problem here, picked it up for 15$. The cashier and other customers were amazed I got it down from 60!"
PS4Deals,33gz08,DarkForce96,2,Wed Apr 22 22:18:50 2015 UTC,I also just grabbed this deal! I called ahead to see if my local Target price matched from Target.com. They did and used the cartwheel app with no problem. They rang me up right in the electronic section. They even asked how I found out about this and directed them to here. I love this subreddit!
PS4Deals,33gz08,NostalgiaSuperUltra,2,Thu Apr 23 15:53:16 2015 UTC,NICE. This Target app is proving to be pretty useful.
PS4Deals,33gz08,RockTheShaz,2,Wed Apr 22 15:15:24 2015 UTC,There is also one for 10% off the console right now
PS4Deals,33gz08,Aroniousj,2,Wed Apr 22 15:23:52 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for the share!!"
PS4Deals,33gz08,Garrick75,2,Wed Apr 22 15:52:14 2015 UTC,It just worked for me. They had to price match from the website first though.

PS4Deals,33gz08,arod944,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:49:23 2015 UTC,Went to target to try it out. Seems they have caught on and do not stack both a price match with the cartwheel discounts.
PS4Deals,33gz08,dano8801,1 point,Fri Apr 24 04:37:12 2015 UTC,What's the price match? OP said they are selling it at $30. Is this not true?
PS4Deals,33gz08,arod944,1 point,Thu Apr 30 02:49:07 2015 UTC,"The price in store was $60 but buy hey would price match to their online price of $29.99. However, they would not mark the price down any further."
PS4Deals,33gz08,dano8801,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:58:40 2015 UTC,Odd.  I didn't realize the price in-store wasn't the same and they still considering it a price match even though it's their own website.
PS4Deals,33gz08,SonnyMalone,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:06:06 2015 UTC,"Oh, man thanks. Been wanting to play this.   It did scan for 60, ...price matched to 30, then used coupon got it for $16.01 with tax."

PS4Deals,33gz08,Inframidi,1 point,Sat Apr 25 00:33:25 2015 UTC,Just ran into a local Target right before they closed. Guy at guest services was super nice and when he saw the game knew I wanted a price match and didnt give me any resistance when I used the cartwheel app. Great experience. $15.24 out the door with my red card.
PS4Deals,33gz08,exclusivegreen,1 point,Sat Apr 25 02:03:56 2015 UTC,"Sadly, it's not supposed to work this way. From Target's ""Shop With Confidence"" page:   Combining both Target, Cartwheel and manufacturer coupons: the Target and Cartwheel coupons will be applied before the price match is made. If the competitor price is still lower than the price after the Target and Cartwheel coupons have been deducted, the ad match can be adjusted to match the competitor's price. Once the price match is made the manufacturer coupon will be applied."
PS4Deals,33gz08,TonyPnzr,1 point,Sun Apr 26 17:06:02 2015 UTC,Denied at entertainment section. Walked over to guest services and they handled it. Guy told me to always ask for a 'GSTL' when u want to combo deals.

PS4Deals,33e4sj,NFLFilmStudy,5,Tue Apr 21 20:03:04 2015 UTC,No shipping and pick in store only. Good deal if there is one near you
PS4Deals,33e4sj,CharlesMarston,3,Tue Apr 21 21:09:38 2015 UTC,"So you need to have a Fry's near you for Best Buy, Target, etc. to price match?"

PS4Deals,33e4sj,LXIV,3,Tue Apr 21 21:37:39 2015 UTC,They price matched for me at Best Buy
PS4Deals,33e4sj,LXIV,1 point,Tue Apr 21 23:41:39 2015 UTC,Do you have a Frys near you though?  I thought they only price matched if there was an actual competitor nearby.
PS4Deals,33e4sj,CharlesMarston,1 point,Tue Apr 21 23:43:46 2015 UTC,I have a Fry's near me. Still might be worth it to check in with your local retailers to see if they'll match since Fry's is a national chain.

PS4Deals,33d5g9,hoffmanbrm,2,Wed Apr 22 14:43:08 2015 UTC,Anyone else seeing the price as $99 on mobile but $79 on a computer...?
PS4Deals,33d5g9,MGiannoni,2,Tue Apr 21 23:16:36 2015 UTC,Yeah it's doing the same here. I just checked from my wiiu browser and it's showing $77.99 on there. That's odd
PS4Deals,33d5g9,hobosaynobo,2,Tue Apr 21 23:22:07 2015 UTC,"This is just speculation, but maybe it's because Wii customers are less likely to buy Playstation products.

PS4Deals,33d5g9,TokenAsianGuy,1 point,Wed Apr 22 01:24:17 2015 UTC,They are the best pair of headphones marketed as 'gaming' headphones. The mic is good and they are insanely comfortable and well-built. I've had my pair for a few months and I wonder how I ever used any other 'gaming' headset.
PS4Deals,33d5g9,dylang5,2,Wed Apr 22 13:00:52 2015 UTC,"Was debating between the Golds and the HyperX, and now I am sold. Thank you. Just ordered a pair!"

The headset rocks BUT the chat mic quality sounds like your in a water bottle and all of you're friends will tell you about it over and over and over making you feel bad about your purchase. Just something to keep in mind. Everything sounds great on my end so it's fine by me, but I may switch to using the PS camera mic or the one that came with the PlayStation."
PS4Deals,33d5g9,dgiangiulio228,11,Tue Apr 21 17:30:47 2015 UTC,"I have used these a lot and been told I sound great when using them, so ymmv."
PS4Deals,33d5g9,TheIrishRazor,2,Tue Apr 21 18:20:33 2015 UTC,"Any tips on how to make it sound better? Did you tweak any settings? I've watched a bunch of videos on YouTube (after making my purchase, like an idiot) and they voice the mic review section of the video with the Gold headset and its pretty consistent with what my friends said they heard. Most say it due to the mic being hidden in the left earphone."
PS4Deals,33d5g9,dgiangiulio228,4,Tue Apr 21 18:25:23 2015 UTC,"I know I had a problem where I was wearing the headset backwards.  The light that indicates it's on should be on your left ear facing forwards.  I felt like an idiot but went from no one being able to understand me to people saying I sounded perfectly clear.  Not sure if that's the issue you're having or not.  Additionally, the PS4 has settings you can adjust for microphone volume."
PS4Deals,33d5g9,BadNewsBrown,2,Tue Apr 21 19:20:44 2015 UTC,It's weird because when I was adjusting the mic level the playback of my voice sounded great.

PS4Deals,33clqs,flyufools,7,Tue Apr 21 13:05:11 2015 UTC,Just have BB price match Amazon? Don't pay more than you have to.

PS4Deals,33clqs,RockTheShaz,5,Tue Apr 21 20:27:20 2015 UTC,It never does. Its either GCU discount or a price match. They dont stack.
PS4Deals,33clqs,NightRed_,7,Wed Apr 22 01:24:07 2015 UTC,It's been that price on amazon for a couple weeks

PS4Deals,33clqs,NightRed_,3,Tue Apr 21 15:43:34 2015 UTC,I've been keeping an eye on it for it to drop more mainly so it gives me time to finish the games I've gotten recently
PS4Deals,33clqs,BeerSlayingBeaver,2,Tue Apr 21 17:19:02 2015 UTC,One of the best games for ps4.  I paid full price when first released.  Worth every penny...

PS4Deals,33clqs,generik777,2,Wed Apr 22 12:29:47 2015 UTC,"so much to do in game, id say its worth full price. DLC is also accessory content & you wont need to worry about buying any of that to enjoy the game. Over 40 hrs. of base game time if youre looking around & exploring while doing the main story/side quests."

PS4Deals,33bhzv,_Kryptik_,2,Tue Apr 21 18:39:39 2015 UTC,"Have to assume this is an error in the POS system, as it is still showing the regular price of $69.96 through walmart.ca.  Still, there's always hope; best bet is to call your local store and keep your fingers crossed."
PS4Deals,33bhzv,RileyCola,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:05:34 2015 UTC,Yeah. From what I can gather a WM in Vancouver had it at 29.99 and another one in Sault St Marie
PS4Deals,33bhzv,_Kryptik_,2,Tue Apr 21 19:43:30 2015 UTC,I went to my local store just now (Winnipeg) and it still came up at 69.95. Had them scan it up and everything
PS4Deals,33bhzv,kyuzosama,2,Tue Apr 21 19:26:28 2015 UTC,Mind if I ask which Walmart store in Winnipeg (looks like there are six of them)?
PS4Deals,33bhzv,nicbhethebear,2,Tue Apr 21 20:03:21 2015 UTC,Kenaston. If you find one in Winnipeg for this price please let me know!

PS4Deals,3398t4,ImThatGuyYouDontKnow,3,Tue Apr 21 01:18:40 2015 UTC,Weird considering Walmart will price match ANY flyer or ad in Canada.
PS4Deals,3398t4,CatOnAHotThinGroove,2,Mon Apr 20 21:37:02 2015 UTC,Also here's the flyers. I will personally go ahead and price match it at Best Buy since I have a $5 coupon there.
PS4Deals,3398t4,x504xBEASTx,2,Mon Apr 20 23:11:40 2015 UTC,Plus you'll save an extra dollar since Best Buy will give you another 10% of the difference.
PS4Deals,3398t4,CatOnAHotThinGroove,1 point,Mon Apr 20 17:44:11 2015 UTC,Rented it for $7.99 and was not disappointed. If I had to pay more than that though it probably would not be worth it.

PS4Deals,335c7l,G_O_,5,Sun Apr 19 19:18:03 2015 UTC,"I think it is absolutely worth it. No cords to lose, and easy / clean storage for your controllers while they charge. When I was using cords only, my controllers were dead a lot. If you have more than 2 controllers, or use your usb ports for Skylander type games, these are essential."
PS4Deals,335c7l,jBURRd,5,Sun Apr 19 19:46:59 2015 UTC,It's the same thing with some plastic wrapped around it.
PS4Deals,335c7l,Golden_Taint,3,Mon Apr 20 01:04:57 2015 UTC,I bought one of these at full price months ago and it has been worth every penny. Charges quickly and efficiently as well as knowing to stop charging when the battery is full. Buy one.
PS4Deals,335c7l,Golden_Taint,8,Sun Apr 19 23:29:40 2015 UTC,"This is the Power A charger that everyone raves about, I own one and absolutely love it. It also plugs into the wall, so you can quit having to run USB cables off of your PS4 and put the dock wherever is convenient.  FYI, these are much more in-store, so buy online to pickup and save money (they won't pricematch their own website in-store)."
PS4Deals,335c7l,knight0fn1,5,Sun Apr 19 18:35:00 2015 UTC,"Best Buy will match it, however!"
PS4Deals,335c7l,grrumble66,2,Sun Apr 19 18:44:33 2015 UTC,"Yes they will! I looked, all the stores in my area have it, good sign that it's widely stocked."
PS4Deals,335c7l,Onemanhopefully,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:49:37 2015 UTC,Confirmed for Best Buy price match. Picked mine up this afternoon.
PS4Deals,335c7l,Golden_Taint,3,Tue Apr 21 02:43:17 2015 UTC,"I got them to match the website price. It just took me a bit to convince them that 'it would just be easier to buy here now than it would be to buy online and wait for them to come out of the back, pick up the same thing off the shelf, and carry it the 50 feet to the pickup desk.'   It was eventually escalated to the store manager who seemed irritated to be bothered with something so stupid and it finally came down to 'Is it available to purchase online? Match it.'  In the end, it would have been faster to buy online but by that point, it was the stupidity of the parade of people they kept involving that made me see it through to the end.  The charger is absolutely worth putting up with the frustration I went through to buy in store. I'll do it again the next time the situation arises. :P"
PS4Deals,335c7l,Onemanhopefully,1 point,Mon Apr 20 22:26:54 2015 UTC,Can you have a USB connected to these so you can still play while it's charging? Or is it always have to be on the dock?
PS4Deals,335c7l,bogart1,1 point,Thu Apr 23 20:47:45 2015 UTC,"The dock has no usb ports, your controller charges when it's mounted. You can always plug the controller into the usb on your PS4 to play while it's charging. I just always have mine mounted in this dock, so when I'm running low I just swap it out for the fresh one."
PS4Deals,335c7l,bstones,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:06:52 2015 UTC,Good to know. Thanks. Guess I'll just be buying a longer USB cord instead.
PS4Deals,335c7l,geoff422,3,Thu Apr 23 21:13:24 2015 UTC,This is the best PS4 charger. So conveintent to keep two controllers charging while using the other two. The light bar goes off when it's full charged then you can swap them out. Building quality is great. It's so worth it at this price.
PS4Deals,334lsu,shogunkiller,1 point,Sun Apr 19 14:22:54 2015 UTC,US only.

PS4Deals,333rm5,coltsmetsfan614,2,Sun Apr 19 20:52:41 2015 UTC,Would I still enjoy this game even if I'm not a big LOTR guy?
PS4Deals,333rm5,Syzygy666,2,Mon Apr 20 13:07:41 2015 UTC,Oh for sure. It's kind of like the Batman games. Open world with super fun fighting mechanics. For 20 bucks you should give it a shot!

PS4Deals,333vo8,ihavepaper,4,Mon Apr 20 00:40:17 2015 UTC,"How does The Evil Within hold up? To survival horror fans and long time resident evil fans, does this game feel genuine? Is it good?"
PS4Deals,333vo8,leolalone,3,Sun Apr 19 15:15:31 2015 UTC,"it's fun. combat is more realistic compared to the newer RE series; you miss a ton of shots if you aren't careful, one hit kills were fairly rare for me (or maybe because i was really bad) and you're no super martial artist, assassin killing machine like leon and Chris are.   overall great game for price. it scared me a ton like the older RE games. some jump scares, but then again i hate horror games."
PS4Deals,333vo8,ihavepaper,2,Mon Apr 20 00:41:45 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's no diamond in the rough as far as originality, but it is the best thing to come to Survival Horror in quite some time. Also a major throwback to the days of old, in my opinion. I loved it, and am currently on play through 2!"
PS4Deals,333vo8,Shadowlink_1990,2,Mon Apr 20 13:59:15 2015 UTC,"has anyone played FF Type-0? It looks great, but how's the combat? I've been watching youtube videos and it reminds me of the Kingdom Hearts card system. if it's similar to normal KH or a Tales game, i'll definitely pick it up."
PS4Deals,333vo8,ihavepaper,3,Mon Apr 20 00:39:21 2015 UTC,It's closer to a normal KH game. Only one character used cards for combat so his playstyle is unique. It's not that bad. I definitely have to warn you about the camera though. It moves so fast and it gets blurry so it took me one or two hours to stop feeling sick.
PS4Deals,333vo8,Destructo-Spin,2,Mon Apr 20 06:03:59 2015 UTC,thanks for the info!
PS4Deals,333vo8,yolofmeister,1 point,Mon Apr 20 06:23:10 2015 UTC,"Combat is a lot of fun. The story picks up around chapter 3 and 4, but like others have said the camera is wonky and the motion blur definitely takes time getting used to. I don't regret buying it for $60."

PS4Deals,333vo8,bstones,5,Sun Apr 19 18:49:59 2015 UTC,"I bought 6 copies at Target when the game was still selling for like $50, they screwed up a coupon and I scored them for $2 each.

PS4Deals,333vo8,rabbitsayer,0,Sun Apr 19 18:54:54 2015 UTC,I don't know if I should believe that. How would they fuck it up that bad lol no way
PS4Deals,333vo8,Pyrocy779,3,Sun Apr 19 19:05:36 2015 UTC,"It was out there, I wasn't the only one. The deal was ""Pre-order a game, get $20 off select titles"". The way Target does pre-orders is you buy a reserve card for $1. They were selling Ghosts for $59.99 so it should've just dropped the price to $39.99. But Amazon was having a blowout sale on Ghosts for $21 and change. If you had Target customer service price match Amazon, you could then scan the pre-order card and the computer was dumb enough to take the $20 off of the $21 Amazon price match. So $2 total per copy. :)  Did the same thing before that with Tomb Raider, Target used to do boneheaded stuff like this all the time."
PS4Deals,333vo8,ExOTiC1234,3,Sun Apr 19 19:31:12 2015 UTC,"They still are. Pricematching and stacking with their sales is always an iffy thing. Hell it gets brought up everytime they do a ""Preorder a game, get X off these games"". Like what is happening this week, when you preorder a select EA game, you get 30% off certain EA games, one being Battlefield Hardline. Hardline is 39.99 at Amazon/ Best Buy.You can potentially stack those. People did it last week when Target Cartwheel had 30% off Battlefield Hardline. Pricematched to Amazons 39.99 then used the Cartwheel app to get it to $28. It was trading into Best Buy for about $35 too if you wanted some extra credit."
PS4Deals,332vct,asiangun,5,Sun Apr 19 00:15:54 2015 UTC,Also same price on Amazon.com.
PS4Deals,332vct,Golden_Taint,2,Sun Apr 19 00:30:08 2015 UTC,Oh man i might want to pick up the white one for $50. Looks so much better than the standard black
PS4Deals,332vct,ExOTiC1234,1 point,Sun Apr 19 07:15:23 2015 UTC,It's also showing up as $50 for the white model too. And $49 for the blue one. At least as of Saturday @ 11:50 AM EST.  Anyway I literally just bought a white one on Friday. Any chance they'll give me $10 back if I go back with a receipt? I guess it doesn't hurt to try.
PS4Deals,332vct,mmiski,3,Sun Apr 19 03:52:03 2015 UTC,"If not, just return it then buy it again."
PS4Deals,332vct,mmiski,1 point,Sun Apr 19 04:08:43 2015 UTC,"Good news. They did price match it and I got $10 back.  So if anyone is wondering this applies to all the other colors too, EXCEPT Magma Red. For some strange reason that one is listed as being $80 on Amazon."

For starters, I would recommend that you get Helldivers (if you like those kind of co-op games) and, of course, The Last of Us Remastered (which is about $12)."

So for 74.19(tax) you get the game, and the season pass.   The season pass actually isn't the season pass though, it's just 30PSN dollars. I used it for the pass, but you do not have to. So basically you're getting 30 PSN dollars for $10 bucks."
PS4Deals,32msef,SAVertigo,3,Thu Apr 16 11:43:44 2015 UTC,Surprised it took so long for someone to mention this. I went yesterday and was pretty confused until I  figured this out.

PS4Deals,32lql4,I_Is_Batman,7,Wed Apr 15 05:51:47 2015 UTC,Let's all hope. But no way cod and other big mainstream games go for 50.
PS4Deals,32lql4,lapride7,-9,Wed Apr 15 08:25:18 2015 UTC,It's a cheaply developed game. Injustice with a skin and different background. Even selling at $50 they making a bundle. And with all the micro-transactions plus DLC. They making more than $60 per game :>  EDIT: Personally i don't think Triple A titles will decline in price. If anything they will increase.

PS4Deals,32lql4,Piricho,2,Sun Apr 19 06:05:34 2015 UTC,"They added and refined a ton of new things in this game, it plays like a completely different fighter than Injustice. How much change do you expect? The genre is pretty specific, so there isn't a WHOLE lot they can do to make it totally unique and new and something we've never seen before. What did you want? A first person mode? 3d movement? An open world?  I feel sorry for you. You seem like a very angry person who is dissatisfied with life."

PS4Deals,32kexl,Frak_You,4,Tue Apr 14 15:25:35 2015 UTC,"While this is a ""deal"", I'd take caution in pulling the trigger as we've seen much greater discount on some bundles recently. Some of those deals have been refurbs, though and this deal is for a brand new PS4 so it's got that going for it, which is nice."
PS4Deals,32kexl,PercussiveScruf,3,Tue Apr 14 16:40:20 2015 UTC,Yeah also have to consider you can get Last of us for just $15
PS4Deals,32kexl,wohlstand,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:06:58 2015 UTC,I bought my system on a similar groupon a month ago.  But mine also came with 1 year PS+.  I also went through e-bates and saved another $25.
PS4Deals,32flbw,kilroyishere89,5,Mon Apr 13 12:01:09 2015 UTC,Everyone should play this game.
PS4Deals,32flbw,DudeJapan,7,Mon Apr 13 21:41:56 2015 UTC,Can't tell if serious...
PS4Deals,32flbw,DudeJapan,3,Mon Apr 13 22:01:26 2015 UTC,I..er....why wouldn't I be serious?
PS4Deals,32flbw,daddysdildo,5,Mon Apr 13 22:22:02 2015 UTC,Should have been $40 to start with.
PS4Deals,32flbw,jakcoy7,1 point,Mon Apr 13 22:43:57 2015 UTC,Ends in 19 hours.
PS4Deals,32flbw,DudeJapan,1 point,Mon Apr 13 12:01:28 2015 UTC,Any good?
PS4Deals,32flbw,d_pyro,1 point,Mon Apr 13 22:20:03 2015 UTC,I really really enjoyed it. It even made me put down bloodborne.
PS4Deals,32flbw,C_Rufio,1 point,Mon Apr 13 22:22:17 2015 UTC,"Damn, wish this deal was on Amazon.ca"
PS4Deals,32flbw,emperornel,1 point,Tue Apr 14 00:36:59 2015 UTC,Just got a PS4 and saw this deal. Watched the review of the game and looks pretty good so I picked it up.
PS4Deals,32flbw,VolticWreckage,1 point,Tue Apr 14 02:35:43 2015 UTC,The deal is back now.
PS4Deals,32fw8r,nerd_ep3,3,Mon Apr 13 13:50:35 2015 UTC,"Best Buy updated their page to include Battleborn, Rainbow 6 Siege, Mad Max, The Division, and Metal Gear Solid V. It's basically, Buy 5 games, get one free. Plus the 2x points you get if you're a GCU member.  Edit: They just added Guitar Hero Live and removed GTA V PC since it launched today."
PS4Deals,32fw8r,churika,2,Mon Apr 13 13:54:44 2015 UTC,MGS V and The Division links don't seem to work for me :(
PS4Deals,32fw8r,flyufools,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:30:05 2015 UTC,"Hmm, they both work for me. But if you just search for the game, you can preorder it that way."
PS4Deals,32fw8r,flyufools,3,Mon Apr 13 21:07:08 2015 UTC,"So many preorders!!!  But really, ya'll. This is a no lose situation. You're getting a game on release day for $47.99. You then get a $10 credit, bringing the game down to $37.99. If the game is no good, you just trade it in for $40-$45, meaning you've actually come out ahead a bit in the process.   I'm no fan of Best Buy, but they're getting all my business as far as games are concerned. The worst part is picking it up at customer service. In the end, I'd say it's worth it."
PS4Deals,32fw8r,Jeovany89,2,Mon Apr 13 22:51:37 2015 UTC,"Well, you don't actually get the $10 certificate till about 15 days after your purchase. But once you get the first one, you can use it on the next one."
PS4Deals,32fw8r,Habieru7,1 point,Mon Apr 13 23:18:58 2015 UTC,"Right you are. I always just roll it over into my next preorder, assuming they're 15 days apart. And I had to call customer service once because they never deposited it into my account, but they fixed it as soon as I called."
PS4Deals,32fw8r,WaywardWit,1 point,Tue Apr 14 00:31:53 2015 UTC,Add on top of that the normal points you get plus Elite Plus and Best Buy Credit Card bonuses(if they apply to you) and you'll be rolling in points.
PS4Deals,32fw8r,one800higgins,1 point,Tue Apr 14 21:44:11 2015 UTC,Do you have to pay off your preorder or is there a minimum amount like Gamestops $5
PS4Deals,32fw8r,one800higgins,3,Mon Apr 13 23:45:09 2015 UTC,Looks like you have to pay it off when you do it online (I didn't finish checking out though)... but I'm pretty sure you can do it in store for $5 or something.
PS4Deals,32fw8r,RaffNav,2,Mon Apr 13 23:54:32 2015 UTC,"Best Buy online doesn't charge you until it ships on all items, including preorders."
PS4Deals,32fw8r,churika,0,Tue Apr 14 00:31:29 2015 UTC,"Technically, if you preorder online, they'll charge the card the moment it goes through. But the charge will go away after a couple of days. Then they'll charge it again when the game ships."
PS4Deals,32fw8r,bstones,2,Tue Apr 14 01:20:53 2015 UTC,"Technically, no they don't. An authorization or even a hold are not the same thing as a charge. As for Best Buy, I've never had them hold any funds and authorizations are not tracked on my bank account as pending or holds since they are simply, ""Can this person afford this?"""
PS4Deals,32fw8r,bstones,1 point,Tue Apr 14 02:04:35 2015 UTC,"I guess that I used the wrong term. They put a hold on the money initially. It'll be ""Pending"" for a few days, then it'll go back in your acct. Either way, you're out $50 when you place the order. That's what happened when I preordered MgsV and MKX. And even when I preordered Guardians Of The Galaxy."
PS4Deals,32cyk3,Golden_Taint,7,Sun Apr 12 19:17:52 2015 UTC,Is Watchdogs worth $16?
PS4Deals,32cyk3,kilroyishere89,12,Sun Apr 12 20:31:22 2015 UTC,I loved it and paid full price at launch.
PS4Deals,32cyk3,LiteralHiggs,7,Sun Apr 12 20:48:16 2015 UTC,For 16. Sure. 60 was a little bit of a letdown but I enjoyed it 16 dollars worth.
PS4Deals,32cyk3,jquickri,6,Sun Apr 12 21:56:45 2015 UTC,"Definitely, in my opinion. Bought it on sale for 25$ around December. Very underrated by a lot of people. Go into it without any preconceptions and it's actually a really fun game."
PS4Deals,32cyk3,Jmeden,2,Sun Apr 12 20:58:15 2015 UTC,I was extremely disappointed E3 really hyped it up and my expectations were sky high.
PS4Deals,32cyk3,basketballrene,2,Mon Apr 13 01:57:58 2015 UTC,"I liked it, you'll get your moneys worth."
PS4Deals,32cyk3,Pyrocy779,2,Sun Apr 12 21:08:31 2015 UTC,"I dropped $80 on it for the PSN Gold Edition, and I actually really loved it. A lot of people knock the storyline; but I found myself immersed in it and, as a result, thoroughly enjoyed it! Go for it!"
PS4Deals,32cyk3,huff610,3,Mon Apr 13 01:18:30 2015 UTC,"Do you get the $10 rewards after putting down a $5 deposit pre-order, or after you pay the full amount?"
PS4Deals,32cyk3,Hoboshanker,3,Sun Apr 12 19:21:55 2015 UTC,It gets added to your My Best Buy account about 7-10 days after you purchase.
PS4Deals,32cyk3,Pyrocy779,2,Sun Apr 12 20:22:42 2015 UTC,It's actually closer to 15-20 days after you fulfill your pre-order.
PS4Deals,32cyk3,okfinethen_,3,Mon Apr 13 13:28:10 2015 UTC,COD:AW is still listed as 49 instead of 39 as posted here .. is that a mistake?
PS4Deals,32cyk3,redpras,2,Sun Apr 12 22:52:28 2015 UTC,"Good catch, it's been corrected. Thanks!"
PS4Deals,32cyk3,basketballrene,2,Sun Apr 12 23:01:57 2015 UTC,This seems like a great deal. If gamefly doesnt ship MKX I will def do this. Thanks. Edit: Gamefly shipped me MKX but this is too good of a deal to pass up.
PS4Deals,32cyk3,somebody7,2,Mon Apr 13 01:58:39 2015 UTC,You forgot Infamous: Second Son (19.99/15.99)
PS4Deals,32cyk3,rem082583,2,Sun Apr 12 21:31:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I added it to the list."
PS4Deals,32cyk3,bjshively,1 point,Sun Apr 12 21:37:32 2015 UTC,Op you may want to add most best buys opening at midnight for release of mortal kombat x
PS4Deals,32cyk3,bjshively,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:08:32 2015 UTC,"I just got Evolve for $39.99 without GCU by pricematching Best Buy to Amazon a few days ago.  Just checked and it is still $39.99 at Amazon, for those of you without GCU that want to grab it at Best Buy for points/convenience."
PS4Deals,32cyk3,KingYesKing,1 point,Mon Apr 13 23:44:44 2015 UTC,Same for CoD: Advanced Warfare. I price matched both as a non-GCU member.
PS4Deals,32cyk3,yolofmeister,1 point,Tue Apr 14 00:31:35 2015 UTC,Time to return Hardline with more money than I bought it for. I got it when it was $31.99 for gCU members now I get to return it for $35. Sweet.
PS4Deals,32cyk3,TotesMessenger,1 point,Wed Apr 15 19:01:07 2015 UTC,Is there any way of getting them digital?
PS4Deals,32d8hq,Ryuhaya8usa,8,Sun Apr 12 20:39:11 2015 UTC,Coupon code is 13507.
PS4Deals,324ldl,AlonzoMoseley,5,Fri Apr 10 15:11:56 2015 UTC,Cartwheel app? How does one utilize this?
PS4Deals,324ldl,alsoye,1 point,Sat Apr 11 02:01:37 2015 UTC,"Download the app to your smart phone, sign in with Facebook/Google+/Target.com account. Search offers for this coupon. Present the barcode to the cashier."

PS4Deals,324ldl,H0tttttt,1 point,Fri Apr 10 15:19:14 2015 UTC,Think this would work for pre-orders?
PS4Deals,324ldl,H0tttttt,1 point,Fri Apr 10 18:23:03 2015 UTC,"I haven't tried it. It does say some exclusions apply, but my gut feeling is that it will work for pre-orders just the same."
PS4Deals,324ldl,lionsongg,2,Fri Apr 10 18:26:28 2015 UTC,Tried to preorder a game in store and it did NOT work. Sales rep said its the equivalent of a pre-paid card. Left with nothing.
PS4Deals,324ldl,smileslime,1 point,Sat Apr 11 20:44:29 2015 UTC,Type 0 is $49 at target plus the 10% off is not bad. Anyone know if this is worth it?
PS4Deals,324ldl,flatliner718,1 point,Sat Apr 11 12:36:42 2015 UTC,"It's pure action gameplay and is not very forgiving. The ""story"" sections can be a little juvenile. Also, the camera is too fast for movement.   I preordered it and put about ten hours into it. Wasn't really my cup of tea."
PS4Deals,324ldl,mrbearbear,1 point,Sat Apr 11 14:36:25 2015 UTC,Probably doesn't work with PSN cards right?
PS4Deals,324ldl,whitesleeve,2,Fri Apr 10 21:27:06 2015 UTC,I would say no since they exclude prepay cards.
PS4Deals,323y6r,swotam,1 point,Fri Apr 10 11:32:58 2015 UTC,Listed as $40 off (MSRP in Canada is $69.99) until April 17. Available online with free shipping or for in-store pickup.
PS4Deals,320t9o,Golden_Taint,2,Thu Apr 9 17:46:29 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong, but I actually think the $10 pre-order certificate is valid to any My Best Buy customer (source). I don't think you need GCU to get that $10. You do need GCU to get the extra 20% off, though."
PS4Deals,320t9o,swemoney,1 point,Fri Apr 10 08:12:32 2015 UTC,"You are correct, GCU just takes the deal from ok to awesome."
PS4Deals,320t9o,sassfactor4,1 point,Fri Apr 10 09:20:07 2015 UTC,Do you know if you get the Goro pre-order bonus from Best Buy?
PS4Deals,320t9o,huggythejerk,1 point,Thu Apr 9 19:28:10 2015 UTC,Correct. Best Buy will either print the code on the receipt or email it to you.
PS4Deals,320t9o,JumpUpHitDown,1 point,Thu Apr 9 19:32:52 2015 UTC,Pardon me but whats gcu?  Does this apply to an online code for the game or is there a way to get goro if I'm not preordering a disc?
PS4Deals,320t9o,eggerWiggin,1 point,Thu Apr 9 19:44:04 2015 UTC,"Gamers Club Unlimited, it's a BB rewards program for video games"
PS4Deals,320t9o,SIRTreehugger,1 point,Thu Apr 9 21:01:36 2015 UTC,Anyone know if this will count for the limited edition?
PS4Deals,320t9o,jquickri,2,Thu Apr 9 21:11:00 2015 UTC,"No it doesn't. Just click on the version of the game and look under special offers. The $10 certificate offer is gone so it doesn't count. Some games have limited editions where it counts like Halo, MK just doesn't....which kind of sucks."
PS4Deals,320t9o,SIRTreehugger,1 point,Fri Apr 10 08:03:54 2015 UTC,I'm a little confused. So does this 10 dollar thing only work for one game? Or could I use it for every game on list?
PS4Deals,320t9o,Wooaahh,1 point,Fri Apr 10 14:30:58 2015 UTC,every game on the list
PS4Deals,320t9o,Wooaahh,1 point,Fri Apr 10 13:49:21 2015 UTC,"Yep, exactly 15 days actually."

PS4Deals,320t9o,swemoney,2,Fri Apr 10 04:06:51 2015 UTC,"You did this in store? Bro, that is not how it goes. You absolutely do NOT have to pay full amount up front, I've pre-ordered many times and never deposited more than $5. And even if you wanted to pay in full, you would never have to pay full amount when you're a GCU member.   You basically got a know-nothing cashier, you should have asked for a manager. Absolutely make sure you get the full refund you're entitled to when you pick up your pre-order."
PS4Deals,320t9o,Wooaahh,2,Fri Apr 10 05:09:52 2015 UTC,"Alright I called them and the person I spoke to said that I'll get the 20% off when the game releases and that money will get put back into my account after it releases, she also said I'll get the $10 reward certificate after the game releases, so we'll see after the release"
PS4Deals,320t9o,swemoney,1 point,Fri Apr 10 06:23:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah in store, I'll call them today when they open and get the difference back"
PS4Deals,320t9o,Wooaahh,1 point,Fri Apr 10 06:50:46 2015 UTC,You should be able to get your money back. I always just put the $5 down until I pick up the game because the discount doesn't go into effect until they scan the actual game.
PS4Deals,320t9o,Hoboshanker,1 point,Fri Apr 10 16:52:07 2015 UTC,"I'll see if I can get the difference back, maybe it was because I paid it off in full right then and there? Idk I'll see later today when they open"
PS4Deals,320t9o,Hoboshanker,1 point,Fri Apr 10 14:34:49 2015 UTC,"Ya. That's definitely the issue. Even when you pay $5, the receipt they give says the full amount of the game before discounts is due and there's a little disclaimer that says the final price could be different with discounts and such."
PS4Deals,320t9o,okfinethen_,1 point,Fri Apr 10 08:08:57 2015 UTC,"I called and they said I'll get the difference credited back onto my account after the game is released, so we'll see in a few days if that's true"
PS4Deals,320t9o,MindYourTounge,1 point,Fri Apr 10 14:35:46 2015 UTC,"Is Mortal Kombat X fully justified as a pre-order? I'm thinking of going with a guaranteed blockbuster hit like Arkham Knight, if I'm going for the $10 certificate."
PS4Deals,320t9o,hoffmanbrm,1 point,Fri Apr 10 20:15:04 2015 UTC,"Hard to say, although all the signs are pointing good. What you can do is do what I did with AC: Unity. Go put down $5 and pre-order, but don't pick it up until the full reviews hit. I obviously cancelled. :)"
PS4Deals,320t9o,MindYourTounge,1 point,Fri Apr 10 21:39:02 2015 UTC,"You pre-order in-store or online? Because I'm lazy to go to the store,you have to fully pre-order and pay full price online."
PS4Deals,320t9o,MindYourTounge,1 point,Thu Apr 9 17:57:38 2015 UTC,"I've never done it online, only in store. I usually do $5 down, I don't know if they officially have a minimum deposit."
PS4Deals,320t9o,redpras,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:02:07 2015 UTC,"If you pre-order In-store, $5 is the minimum deposit you need to put down. You can however pay the entire retail price of the game at that time as well. When you pre-order on BestBuy.com, you pay the entire price of the game when you pre-order. =]"
PS4Deals,320t9o,thonnie,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:09:03 2015 UTC,How do I claim this? I recently got GCU for the sole purpose of mortal kombat. I pre-ordered it in store with $5 deposit. One for me and one for my friend. How do I get this?
PS4Deals,31svts,gamingmn,7,Tue Apr 7 22:18:35 2015 UTC,Is the Deluxe Edition worth?

PS4Deals,31svts,wohlstand,1 point,Thu Apr 9 08:27:36 2015 UTC,Aaaaaand that's exactly what the sale is.

PS4Deals,31svts,pr0adam,2,Wed Apr 8 03:17:25 2015 UTC,I was hoping the DLC would be on sale. I didn't realize it had been delayed due to Xbox exclusivity.

PS4Deals,31svts,FictionaI,0,Fri Apr 17 13:59:24 2015 UTC,Same price as the sale a couple months ago... Pretty lame.
PS4Deals,31svts,MaggleDole,4,Wed Apr 8 05:33:39 2015 UTC,"What's lame about that? It's still selling, it's a good game, and they periodically put it on sale. That's a great strategy. What did you expect? $20?"
PS4Deals,31svts,AlonzoMoseley,6,Wed Apr 8 10:43:21 2015 UTC,"It's still only $4 cheaper than buying the disc from Amazon or Walmart. Not a big enough differential to offset their increased profits by selling digital and direct, or the lack of potential resale of the disc by the consumer. So yeah, $20. Why not."
PS4Deals,31svts,muhaski,0,Wed Apr 8 18:01:06 2015 UTC,OP for the process incorrect.  It's actually on sale for 41.99
PS4Deals,31svts,MaggleDole,-2,Thu Apr 9 22:21:44 2015 UTC,"I bit. Convenience, you know?"
PS4Deals,31svts,FictionaI,-2,Wed Apr 8 18:56:01 2015 UTC,I just wish the sale was slightly larger than the one a few months ago...? Sorry for wanting to save money!  I already own the game in physical form. I just want the digital version so I can get rid of my disc.
PS4Deals,31svts,Snorfle247,1 point,Wed Apr 8 15:50:51 2015 UTC,Especially disappointing considering during the EA sale a couple months back DA2 was $3 or something nuts like that (and the DLC was significantly marked down as well).
PS4Deals,31rwz1,Jalangaloze,5,Tue Apr 7 18:13:34 2015 UTC,Great game
PS4Deals,31rwz1,akeytoasafe,-1,Tue Apr 7 21:23:49 2015 UTC,Back to $24 lol...
PS4Deals,31sfd8,nofulaso,2,Tue Apr 7 20:22:29 2015 UTC,Too bad TLOU is not in that deal. :( Would definitely have picked it up.

PS4Deals,31sfd8,Agret,0,Wed Apr 8 15:36:43 2015 UTC,But that is US :( Sadly the sales in the EU seem to be a lot worse
PS4Deals,31sfd8,SuperRetardedDog,3,Wed Apr 8 15:46:27 2015 UTC,They are digital versions. All you need to do is create a free USA account and tell it to use your console as the primary. Activate the code and start the download from the US account and then sign out and you can play it from your EU account no issues (just don't delete the US account). I use my Australian account to play but I have a bunch of stuff on a US account I made.
PS4Deals,31sfd8,Agret,1 point,Wed Apr 8 15:53:00 2015 UTC,I will look into that. How safe is it? Sony doesn't ban people for doing that?
PS4Deals,31sfd8,SuperRetardedDog,1 point,Wed Apr 8 16:18:45 2015 UTC,"Sony doesn't ban you no, you can have up to 15 accounts on your ps4 and you can only have 1 primary console per account but since its your account and your console it's all good."
PS4Deals,31sfd8,Agret,2,Wed Apr 8 16:22:30 2015 UTC,Thank you. Setting it up right now.  It's ridiculous how bad and less frequent the sales are here in Europe compared to the US.
PS4Deals,31sfd8,SuperRetardedDog,1 point,Wed Apr 8 16:25:13 2015 UTC,So far so good. Redeemed the code and am now downloading the game. :D
PS4Deals,31sfd8,SuperRetardedDog,1 point,Wed Apr 8 17:04:45 2015 UTC,Cool man. If you want to take advantage of any USA PSN sales you can buy the psn cards digitally from Amazon by using a USA billing address (pick one from a state that has no sales tax)  and it will let you buy them no prob then you just redeem that psn code onto your US account and go shopping :)  only downside is because the US account isn't your main one you don't get any PS+ discounts but there are still good sales from time to time.
PS4Deals,31sfd8,Agret,1 point,Wed Apr 8 22:41:09 2015 UTC,"So you only get the ps plus deals on your main account and the free games are different for US and EU?   And 1 more question, isn't HDD space going to be a big issue if you download everything digitally? I assume you can delete games you no longer play and just reinstall them whenever you want?   Thanks for all the help btw. I'm definitely very happy with my ps4 now. Being able to take advantage of US sales is going to save me TONS of money."
PS4Deals,31sfd8,SuperRetardedDog,1 point,Thu Apr 9 04:27:31 2015 UTC,"Free games are sometimes different between EU and US yeah but only way to get the free US games is to pay for a US PSN sub, once again you can buy the cards from Amazon. Psn access is shared between your accounts so you could pay for US psn and play online using your EU still but you will lose access to all your previous free EU games until you pay for EU again.  As for hdd space yeah it can be an issue if you are going to stick to the 500gb drive that comes with the ps4. I bought a 2tb segate backup plus usb3 drive and just took apart the case and put the drive in my ps4 then put the PS4s 500gb into the case. You can always delete and redownload games though that's not a problem, just make sure your save is copied to a usb first cause deleting a game also deletes your local saves for it."
PS4Deals,31sfd8,Agret,2,Thu Apr 9 06:34:10 2015 UTC,Are they in English (typically)
PS4Deals,31sfd8,PickerLeech,2,Wed Apr 8 06:20:59 2015 UTC,"But you can just change the audio ingame, can't you?"

PS4Deals,31o2wf,hoffmanbrm,2,Mon Apr 6 20:34:01 2015 UTC,I may or may not have been the seller mentioned here initially.   These were surplus cards bought from Sony Distribution. The limitations were unknown at the time and the disconnect between wholesale and 1st level support is now obvious.   Regardless. Turns out 2 cards can be redeemed per account and you must be in the USA.   I have approx 500x Sony Rewards Cards that expire 6/30/15. I will be giving them out all night via our company Facebook page and Twitter account. Look us up on both (Progamecards) and like/follow.  Any questions or concerns please ask!
PS4Deals,31o2wf,qlapp28,1 point,Wed May 20 22:12:22 2015 UTC,Thanks for sharing. I'm looking forward to the giveaway.
PS4Deals,31o2wf,hoowahman,2,Wed May 20 23:42:11 2015 UTC,So last night I bought 2 sets of 10 reward codes..20 total for about $75.  They were all shipped to me via email in a zip. I just entered them all in the sony rewards site and got 2 $50 PSN credit codes which are now on my playstation store account. It's legit!  It's like getting 25% off everything digitally.
PS4Deals,31o2wf,Johnny_Guano,1 point,Tue Apr 7 11:21:03 2015 UTC,Did you link your accounts with them? Because I am trying to order the PSN cards and now they want shipping info - not instant codes.
PS4Deals,31o2wf,hoowahman,1 point,Tue Apr 7 13:59:30 2015 UTC,You mean with sony rewards? They might want shipping but will give you an ecode and an email.
PS4Deals,31o2wf,theGalaxyBird,1 point,Tue Apr 7 14:02:30 2015 UTC,Do you mean you had to create multiple rewards accounts?
PS4Deals,31o2wf,hoowahman,1 point,Wed Apr 8 00:19:59 2015 UTC,No I only have one account
PS4Deals,31o2wf,OneLuckyContestant,1 point,Wed Apr 8 01:09:19 2015 UTC,You got codes for the PSN credit via email?  I ordered 2 last night and it looks like they are going to ship me physical cards.
PS4Deals,31o2wf,hoowahman,2,Wed Apr 8 12:44:04 2015 UTC,Yes I did...I got 2 $50 codes and a $10 code.
PS4Deals,31o2wf,OneLuckyContestant,1 point,Thu Apr 9 17:46:54 2015 UTC,Hmm... now I'm getting worried.  I still don't have anything other than an order confirmation email from the night I placed the order.  I may need to hit up customer service if I don't hear anything by the end of the day.
PS4Deals,31o2wf,jetsfan07,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:34:12 2015 UTC,Did you get in trouble for this?

PS4Deals,31o2wf,faceofbear,2,Wed Apr 22 12:13:45 2015 UTC,You also get $50 PSN credit for free if you sign up for the PlayStation credit card.
PS4Deals,31o2wf,Johnny_Guano,2,Mon Apr 6 23:40:13 2015 UTC,"Seems like a pretty good deal. And if you buy 2 -- the 2nd one is 10% off. Seller rating at 99.9%  EDIT - Turns out this is a big pain. Word to the unwise - this is like playfire ... you have to sign up, then enter codes (in $5 increments) AND sign in repeatedly. Not worth the savings for me. STAY AWAY - it will only let you order a limited number of PSN store credits it says (and I can't even get these to go through)."

I bring them to work (USB paired with laptop) , use them for my ps4, use them on my PC for games. I'm pretty satisfied for $75. Haven't had them for a long time yet so I can't comment on their durability yet. Obviously they don't have Bluetooth but if they had USB and Bluetooth they would be even more satisfying."

Audio quality is excellent and they are very comfortable when worn for long periods of time. I can see how some people may have broke theirs, as they do feel light and the top band is quite thin. But I think you take good care of them and don't abuse them then they will hold up just fine.  Tldr: great headset for the price"
PS4Deals,31dxu7,wobel85,2,Sat Apr 4 15:24:51 2015 UTC,"Bought this at Best Buy last night via the price match. I was momentarily tempted by the $300 insane Turtle Beach 800 or whatever it's called, but decided to be responsible and buy what I came for instead. Love the sound quality so far."

I can't walk away from my ps4 more than 8 feet without terrible connection problems. the original headset is better in that aspect because it's wired to the controller and I can walk around with it, so there are less issues. And it also breaks up the chat audio when  I am directly in front of the ps4,  more so then with the traditional wired headset. And this audio problem happens quite often. my friend has the same headset with the same issues.  Also the charge doesn't last long enough, I have to make sure to plug the headset in every night. wish I could get more then 6 hrs out of a charge because I use this headset a lot for just watching Netflix and hulu at night when it needs to be quite.   And I hate that the side plastic pieces are removable, it makes it feel cheap and I accidentally slide them off when trying to adjust my headset in the middle of a game. Do they even sell after market pieces for this headset?"

PS4Deals,31dxu7,redbull123,1 point,Sat Apr 4 18:50:24 2015 UTC,"They are good headsets for the price the buttons are all located in the left ear cup volume control ""surround sound"" mute game and chat audio buttons all early accessible. While it is hard to distinguish all the buttons from each other you learn witch is which very quickly. I use these for every thing from playing destiny to watching hulu and now with Spotify these head sets are great.  The head sets are comfortable their is cushion on the top and on both ear pieces I've used them for 3 hours straight with no problems. The battery last about 2 days for me and I play games almost 3 hours every couple of nights so I think you can get about 6 hours on one good charge. (always charge your electronics tag soon as you  get them it helps.) If your playing longer than six hours at a time please take a break your eyes will thank you.   I've had these headsets for almost a year about 10 months and they've taken multiple drops from my hands from the dresser and my backpack and their still going even my 3 year old son uses them for his movies from time to time.   Out of the box they come with manuals and 1 foot charging cable :/ USB dongle and a pair of male to male 3.5mm jack so you can use them just like regular stereo headsets. With the 3.5mm jack to do loss the ""surround sound "" but their still great headsets with out that feature.   One last thing I want to mention is the surround sound feature IT IS NOT TRUE SURROUND SOUND it's a custom built eq setting between the ps4 and the headset to MIMIC surround sound. If your an audiophile you will be able to tell the difference. I have used high end gaming headsets in the past and to be completely honest I don't care they sound good fit great and their a blast to use with Spotify. Pick them up if your a daily player or even a late night player like me believe me when I say your SO will love not being able to hear your game in the middle of the night."
PS4Deals,31dxu7,gorte1ec,1 point,Sat Apr 4 22:13:32 2015 UTC,Pretty much agree with everything you said - the main thing I like about them is the comfort. I can wear them for hours and not feel like I'm wearing anything at all.

PS4Deals,31dxu7,whitesleeve,1 point,Sat Apr 4 05:09:32 2015 UTC,"No, their customer service was pretty terrible TBH. I am considering selling the dongle on ebay though because apparently a lot of people lose them so they sell well."

PS4Deals,31bm6j,Northernlight02,2,Sat Apr 4 01:19:49 2015 UTC,"I would like to buy digital version (not only this game, but PS4 games generally) - but they (Amazon) almost never discount $60 digital PS4 games...  It makes me think they are not allowed to do it, because of PS Store. (?)  I hope it will change in the near future."
PS4Deals,31bm6j,WR4ITH,1 point,Fri Apr 3 18:48:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I really don't get it. You would figure the prices of digital products would be cheaper since there is zero manufacturing cost of the physical product...  Plus as an incentive to have people buy on a whim"
PS4Deals,31bm6j,FictionaI,2,Fri Apr 3 23:06:38 2015 UTC,My theory is that they are going to keep the price up for impulse buys and the convenience. If there is ever sales or significant price drops for digital content id like to know where and when.
PS4Deals,31bm6j,huggythejerk,0,Sat Apr 4 02:36:07 2015 UTC,"I suppose you're right, even though lower prices would lead to many more impulse buys. I just wish PSN digital would go the way of Steam. But wishful thinking for the time being.  Not to mention, digital sales eliminate the used game market which is even more incentive to reduce the price... The current system is just backwards."
PS4Deals,31bm6j,FictionaI,2,Sat Apr 4 17:14:59 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, if they have several hundred physical copies lying around, that takes up warehouse space.  So often they'll drop the price significantly to reduce inventory."
PS4Deals,31bm6j,RedPhoenix122,2,Sat Apr 4 16:31:25 2015 UTC,I thought this was scarier than alien isolation. Definitely more grotesque and surreal
PS4Deals,31bm6j,udbluehens,1 point,Fri Apr 3 20:28:21 2015 UTC,Did anyone get a screenshot of this when it was 19.99? Wanted to bring it into Best Buy to get a price match. Also - is what I'm describing a valid strategy?
PS4Deals,31bm6j,jpegs21,2,Mon Apr 6 01:15:07 2015 UTC,"No it isn't, has to be a current deal. They may be fooled by your screenshot being live, but probably not."

PS4Deals,3182ol,gottheitis,6,Thu Apr 2 19:14:15 2015 UTC,what can i do with a dell gift card?
PS4Deals,3182ol,G_O_,2,Thu Apr 2 20:26:02 2015 UTC,"Buy anything from Dell.com, put it towards another game when you get it. It means you could buy another new release and pay $34.99 instead of $59.99. Personally, I still think it's a better deal to buy a GCU membership, all new release games like this would be $47.99 for two years."
PS4Deals,3182ol,Golden_Taint,6,Thu Apr 2 21:21:40 2015 UTC,"No, GCU discount is for unlimited titles. You just can't buy more than three copies of the same game per console, to prevent other dealers from using Best Buy for stock. So you can use your discount for yourself and two other people for literally every game they sell."
PS4Deals,3182ol,Golden_Taint,1 point,Fri Apr 3 23:54:24 2015 UTC,what golden_taint said. . there was this deal for evolve and i bought bloodborne using the eGift card and receiving another eGift card. so basically i just keep pre ordering the games with this same deal and getting them for $34.99.

PS4Deals,3182ol,kotogo,1 point,Fri Apr 3 11:25:01 2015 UTC,I don't think so. I've heard others mention they've gotten a newly released game a few days after it's hit stores.
PS4Deals,3182ol,bonerpotpie,4,Fri Apr 3 19:48:31 2015 UTC,I'm going to wait six months for the super deluxe GOTY edition that includes the ton of DLC

PS4Deals,313cbk,iUsedtoHadHerpes,2,Wed Apr 1 22:22:18 2015 UTC,"I hear ya ... I almost have all the games I want at this point, and the few more that I do want I don't have the HD space for (besides I can wait for them to go lower). Sony really should've made the HD at least a 2TB. As is you can install about 8 big games on it ... kind of ridiculous."
PS4Deals,313cbk,iUsedtoHadHerpes,1 point,Wed Apr 1 23:05:39 2015 UTC,"Sorry to bother, but I couldn't get the code to do anything. I was thinking about getting Saints Row IV, and I added the code to the order when I put it in my cart, but it didn't affect the price at all. Am I possibly doing something wrong?"
PS4Deals,313cbk,citrus3000psi,2,Wed Apr 1 22:34:45 2015 UTC,"It must be something you are doing ... I just tried it on FIFA 15 (thanks for tempting me) and it worked. Add to cart; C&P promo and apply, discount added."
PS4Deals,313cbk,OlUncleMunnerlyn,1 point,Wed Apr 1 23:02:55 2015 UTC,Thanks again. I will try on the PC and see if it's just a mobile issue.
PS4Deals,313cbk,Silverfx,1 point,Wed Apr 1 23:17:08 2015 UTC,Tried again on PC but it doesn't seem to have made much difference. I can't figure out what the problem is.  Edit: Tried on another game and it worked. Must just be not working for Saints Row for some reason.
PS4Deals,313cbk,iUsedtoHadHerpes,1 point,Thu Apr 2 00:08:49 2015 UTC,That's odd. I was surprised I got it for Bloodborne really. It's been out not even a week.
PS4Deals,313cbk,dantheman244,1 point,Thu Apr 2 00:28:22 2015 UTC,Hey just so you know ... I ran across the same problem going thru some PS3 games.  Some used games don't seem to discount. Have no idea why.

PS4Deals,313cbk,iUsedtoHadHerpes,2,Wed Apr 1 23:14:32 2015 UTC,I am tempted on that one too ... but it's also on PC. I can wait for it to go much lower.

PS4Deals,312oe7,Golden_Taint,10,Wed Apr 1 18:37:14 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, they do not price protect (one of the reasons I hate them). Obviously ask, you never know.  One thing you can do if they won't hook you up: Buy a second copy at the new lower price, don't open it. Return it, but using your first receipt and get your money back that way."

PS4Deals,312oe7,Professor_Layton,1 point,Wed Apr 1 20:22:16 2015 UTC,How does this play via remote play?  Hopefully it's not too late for an answer!
PS4Deals,312oe7,Twentyamf28,1 point,Wed Apr 1 21:39:13 2015 UTC,How is this game? Never been a car game guy but $20 I could pick it up
PS4Deals,312oe7,Medikated,1 point,Wed Apr 1 23:34:58 2015 UTC,I got it for $30 last week at gamestop. Purchased the season pass 2 days later. Its an awesome game. Was never much of a racer before.
PS4Deals,312oe7,osmlol,1 point,Thu Apr 2 00:36:11 2015 UTC,Same here. I'm totally not mad I paid 30 a week ago and I feel I have gotten the value if the season pass already. Really enjoying this arcade style.

PS4Deals,3125nn,wohlstand,2,Thu Apr 2 08:27:28 2015 UTC,"The other way actually. With digital goods, the buyer has the upperhand at Paypal. Paypal has very few protections for digital goods. With physical goods however, the seller has quite a few protections, and typically gets the upperhand."

PS4Deals,3125nn,Joniak,2,Thu Apr 2 14:38:55 2015 UTC,Wow price for this game keeps dropping lower every time I see a new post for it.  How low will it go?
PS4Deals,3125nn,rainmcmanis,11,Wed Apr 1 15:56:41 2015 UTC,Well seeing as how I finally broke down and bought it you can more than likely expect it to be free via PlayStation Plus next month...
PS4Deals,3125nn,brotherolly,3,Wed Apr 1 16:10:22 2015 UTC,Thanks for taking one for the team.  We appreciate it!
PS4Deals,3125nn,rainmcmanis,1 point,Wed Apr 1 16:15:10 2015 UTC,"It'll probably be free for PS+ eventually, but if you're dying to play it it's worth the money."

PS4Deals,30yk14,dashKay,2,Wed Apr 1 04:35:34 2015 UTC,It's was 35.99 back in February during the critic's choice sale so hopefully it'll at least be that price.
PS4Deals,30yk14,ellaeaea,2,Thu Apr 2 14:36:13 2015 UTC,Game is pretty good. I bought it when they had the digital sale going on. If you don't own it I would say 40 is a pretty fair price for how much is in the game.
PS4Deals,30yk14,Skudruckus21,3,Tue Mar 31 20:04:25 2015 UTC,This game is simply the best entertainment value for your ps4. I cannot recommend it enough.
PS4Deals,30yk14,Adamtess,1 point,Wed Apr 1 04:40:17 2015 UTC,I've put in about 100 combined hours with three different characters and an nowhere near done with this game. This is the best bang for your buck
PS4Deals,30yy0k,ThatLesbian,17,Tue Mar 31 20:52:53 2015 UTC,Buying a pre owned copy of ff14 is literally buying the box and disc. You need a new copy of the game to get the code that comes with it to activate your account.   So do not buy this unless you already have the digital version of this game and just want the box on your shelf.
PS4Deals,30yy0k,pr0adam,4,Tue Mar 31 21:11:57 2015 UTC,"what this guy said. Please avoid to buy this game used, unless you know what are you doing.."
PS4Deals,30yy0k,Mandujano33,-3,Tue Mar 31 21:38:13 2015 UTC,"Is this not the cheapest way to have the privilege of downloading a game, just to spend more on a sub?  Or will they still hit you up for the 30+ for your first month?"
PS4Deals,30yy0k,ActionFlank,2,Tue Mar 31 23:33:50 2015 UTC,"No, once the disc installs it'll ask you to input the code that came with the game. Since this pre owned, that code is non existent, so it'll have you go to PSN store, by the code, then patch the game or whatever, first  month comes with the price, then you pay for the sub. Assuming I understood you correctly, all buying this pre owned copy does is allow you to install the game without downloading it (still need to get patches) and put the case on your shelf."
PS4Deals,30yy0k,pr0adam,-4,Tue Mar 31 23:37:25 2015 UTC,Wow.  Amazing.  Eve really spoiled me with just expecting to pay a sub.
PS4Deals,30yy0k,ActionFlank,3,Tue Mar 31 23:43:52 2015 UTC,"Well I never played eve, but with WoW you have to buy the game, it comes with a free month, then you buy the sub"
PS4Deals,30yy0k,pr0adam,-3,Wed Apr 1 01:06:34 2015 UTC,Don't say buy and free.

PS4Deals,30q62q,Manning119,-5,Sun Mar 29 21:30:03 2015 UTC,Exactly. Leave it to the real basketball fans. I watched the game today and at about halftime i found out about this deal and was pissed off. Now all the frontrunners who probably will play this once will pick it up before me. Im mad that its get a lot of publicity

PS4Deals,30q62q,iamjustinleon,4,Sun Mar 29 23:11:59 2015 UTC,Will it work if I put it in my cart now and leave it?
PS4Deals,30q62q,viceman99,3,Mon Mar 30 01:19:29 2015 UTC,"No idea.  May have to try this.  Edit: Talked to Amazon, this will not work."
PS4Deals,30q62q,holder_account,4,Mon Mar 30 05:54:25 2015 UTC,They just tweeted the link but still no price change.
PS4Deals,30q62q,Bizarre48,4,Mon Mar 30 18:13:14 2015 UTC,I added to cart and the price  changed
PS4Deals,30q62q,J3RM0,2,Mon Mar 30 19:04:35 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this! Wasn't seeing it, but once I added to cart, sure enough discount showed."
PS4Deals,30q62q,streetmapp,4,Mon Mar 30 19:06:17 2015 UTC,Was able to get one yay for 1-click buy. Now I have a party game for my friends.
PS4Deals,30q62q,moonreader,3,Mon Mar 30 19:08:01 2015 UTC,Never played an NBA 2k game but I might just pick this up.
PS4Deals,30q62q,friedpigeons,2,Mon Mar 30 19:07:23 2015 UTC,It's a great sports game ... really well done.  But do you like Basketball? The pace can be so boring .
PS4Deals,30q62q,Johnny_Guano,3,Sun Mar 29 21:13:52 2015 UTC,"I play FIFA and do enjoy Madden and to a lesser extent the NHL games. I like college hoops, UConn student here, I much prefer to watch the NCAA games too."
PS4Deals,30q62q,friedpigeons,2,Mon Mar 30 02:22:33 2015 UTC,honestly 2k10 or whenever the first one I played helped me get into the NBA a lot more. Went from watching a few games a year to following my team pretty damn closely
PS4Deals,30q62q,DevsiK,1 point,Mon Mar 30 03:31:35 2015 UTC,"I used to follow basketball quite a bit back in the day. Then it started developing a lot of of problems, which they partially solved with the 24 sec clock. Then the final nail in the coffin is all the GD timeouts at the end - just when it gets really exciting and what the whole game has been building up to, they continually douse the game with buckets of ice water & commercials. Sure it's the 'right call' by the coaches in the game ... but it kills the climax of any close game .... and basketball is all about the finish too."
PS4Deals,30q62q,Johnny_Guano,2,Mon Mar 30 03:53:38 2015 UTC,"The timeouts and weak defensive work rates are a turnoff to NBA for me, I think it's a lot more exciting too when guys are just on the court and having to figure out the best way to close out games in the moment instead of a TO being called and them running some bullshit plays, there's a level of panic and anxiety that's lost. Also, music being played during the game."
PS4Deals,30q62q,friedpigeons,6,Mon Mar 30 04:09:50 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, order by 1-click is really 1-click."
PS4Deals,30q62q,rdelamora1,3,Mon Mar 30 04:45:41 2015 UTC,Yeah.... Good thing you can cancel it with two clicks.
PS4Deals,30q62q,TGrady902,2,Mon Mar 30 18:53:48 2015 UTC,Anyone know if any stores (Wal Mart or Best Buy) will price match the 10.99 price?
PS4Deals,30q62q,Alex-7-E,3,Mon Mar 30 19:05:40 2015 UTC,Very doubtful.  The price isn't going to stick for long.

PS4Deals,30q62q,cats05,2,Mon Mar 30 19:54:09 2015 UTC,Got it! Added it to my cart then it showed the updated price. Total was $16 with shipping
PS4Deals,30q62q,WanderingBear_,2,Mon Mar 30 19:11:49 2015 UTC,Picked it up for Xbox One. I have a PS4 as well. I couldn't find any real differences online. Hopefully I didn't pick up the inferior version.
PS4Deals,30q62q,FlutGOS,2,Mon Mar 30 19:14:20 2015 UTC,"Looks like they may be out already, main listing is back to $38 sold by a third party and fulfilled by Amazon, not directly sold by Amazon."
PS4Deals,30q62q,SpoonThief,2,Mon Mar 30 19:20:23 2015 UTC,Ahhh yeah looks like the PS4 version is gone. Xbox One version is still up.
PS4Deals,30q62q,FlutGOS,1 point,Mon Mar 30 19:20:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah - I had it in my cart and from the time it changed to $11, I didn't even have enough time to change shipping addresses and credit cards. I think they had 1 copy for each console :p And yes, I'm bitter."

PS4Deals,30qt21,numeralCow,1 point,Mon Mar 30 13:34:08 2015 UTC,Yeah it only applies to the purchase of a new PS4. You might be able to return the device after purchase and get the full credit but as posted above it seems the result varies.
PS4Deals,30qt21,Inframidi,1 point,Mon Mar 30 16:02:41 2015 UTC,You could sell the PS4 quickly and use that money for games.
PS4Deals,30qt21,IMightBeGoodToYou,1 point,Mon Mar 30 18:42:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is a $50 trade in then when they ring up a PS4 it discounts it $125."

PS4Deals,30qt21,DudeGuy123,2,Sun Mar 29 23:58:13 2015 UTC,Return the PS4 and get $175 in store credit.... Then use that credit to get Amazon gift cards.
PS4Deals,30qt21,Josh_ftw,4,Mon Mar 30 00:39:18 2015 UTC,"On slickdeals people are saying that this doesn't work.    Some ppl reported that the $175 trade-in credit no longer valid if returned (only $60 credit will be return, $115 credit is voided)<===BE VERY AWARE"
PS4Deals,30qt21,one800higgins,1 point,Mon Mar 30 00:55:46 2015 UTC,How is it returned if it's spent on another item?
PS4Deals,30qt21,Charmanderp7,2,Mon Mar 30 03:42:28 2015 UTC,Really? I had the 4gb and a 250gb harddrive and they didnt take it and since it didnt have a cover for the ports on the back they saw it as defective and got a wooping fucking $17 for a damn xbox.
PS4Deals,30qt21,lynx17,4,Mon Mar 30 00:16:15 2015 UTC,It may vary by location. My PS3 case had a decent hole in the front and they only offered $30. When they rang up the PS4 the computer kicked it up to the $175. The clerk seemed as surprised as I was that it still gave the credit.
PS4Deals,30qt21,trashonclybourn,1 point,Mon Mar 30 15:58:31 2015 UTC,My buddy has the 1st Gen PS3. Does it matter which PS3 it is or is it only the 250GB they are accepting?
PS4Deals,30qt21,citrus3000psi,1 point,Mon Mar 30 22:49:01 2015 UTC,All I saw on the GameStop site was that it had to be 120gb or greater for PS3 and 250gb or greater for Xbox 360
PS4Deals,30qt21,TheFistOfRussia,1 point,Mon Mar 30 22:59:40 2015 UTC,Kinda blows i did this deal when it was $150. I didn't figure they would give a better deal at a later point.
PS4Deals,30qt21,theDouggle,1 point,Tue Mar 31 23:18:01 2015 UTC,"I did this yesterday. (already have a ps4, so looking for credit)  The gamestop employee said he couldn't return the ps4 (He mentioned another employee had been fired over something similar).  Reguardless I went with the deal.  Took the ps4 to another gamestop and got the 175 credit.  I ended up getting a used but mint white xboxone."
PS4Deals,30qt21,TheFistOfRussia,1 point,Wed Apr 1 19:57:13 2015 UTC,So I called 3 surrounding Gamestops and they all told me that the trade in didn't stack; I couldn't trade in 2 consoles and get $350 - only one trade in per PS4.  The crappy part is that I know people have traded in 2 consoles at once and it works.  Why are these particular Gamestops telling me that it's not possible?
PS4Deals,30qt21,theDouggle,1 point,Fri Apr 3 04:42:52 2015 UTC,"Since this is a time-sensitive promotion, they may have not developed the system to interact with the database in a way that they can easily modify it.  They don't WANT to credit 2xPS3@$175/each and didn't intend to, but didn't set up the database to DENY that type of input, so they have their minimum wage workers seeing it happen and not give a shit, and now that it has happened enough they sent a memo to managers saying ""stop it"" instead of just fixing the database.  Or maybe they did fix it, and everyone else is SOL - that's what the fine print is for, ""we reserve the right to say fuck you"" and whatnot."
PS4Deals,30piic,danNYtrack,4,Sun Mar 29 16:02:04 2015 UTC,im trying to upgrade my ps4's hard drive. Is this a good upgrade?
PS4Deals,30piic,HotKingChocolate,4,Sun Mar 29 19:04:30 2015 UTC,"In terms of space, this is the best upgrade possible for ps4, at the best price I've seen 2TB externals go for."
PS4Deals,30piic,pr0adam,3,Sun Mar 29 19:06:14 2015 UTC,"Do you actually replace the PS4 hard drive with this one, or just connect it externally?"
PS4Deals,30piic,coltsmetsfan614,5,Sun Mar 29 22:08:55 2015 UTC,Yes you unscrew /pry the casing off it and it's just like a regular 2.5 laptop hdd inside that you can put in a ps4. A very good guide posted on /r/ps4 showed some picture of this but I'm on mobile atm and unfortunately can't link it.
PS4Deals,30piic,pr0adam,2,Sun Mar 29 22:35:15 2015 UTC,can you hook the drive up to the ps4 and use that as the primary drive like the xbox one does?
PS4Deals,30piic,greatwhitehype_,2,Sun Mar 29 22:37:26 2015 UTC,"By primary drive do you mean like run games off of it? If so, no unfortunately. Currently externals only really used for backing up your current hdd"
PS4Deals,30piic,pr0adam,1 point,Sun Mar 29 22:40:19 2015 UTC,"Without following the links, if this is a usb drive then you just take hard drive out of the casing and it v will be just like any other laptop drive."

PS4Deals,30piic,SteveBDrums,-2,Tue Mar 31 13:36:42 2015 UTC,It's out of context because of how these hard drives are used compared  to the way they will be used in a ps4.
PS4Deals,30piic,pr0adam,1 point,Tue Mar 31 13:56:42 2015 UTC,"That makes no sense whatsoever.  The fact that the data came from aggregation of server data means nothing.  Hard disks on servers aren't always constantly reading and writing data any more than a standard PC would be.  No moreso than the average PS4 user's console might be on for 1-2 hours a day max, whereas a hardcore player might be on for 8-12 hours.  Your assertion that the data is out of context just based on the application of the hard disk is pretty much nonsense."
PS4Deals,30piic,SteveBDrums,-2,Wed Apr 1 00:40:49 2015 UTC,OK whatever you say.
PS4Deals,30piic,pr0adam,2,Wed Apr 1 01:07:19 2015 UTC,Does getting SSD actually improve loading speed for PS4? Which one is the best SSD for PS4?
PS4Deals,30piic,coolgaara,1 point,Mon Mar 30 15:58:58 2015 UTC,Yes but not enough to justify the cost imo I feel that space is more important to shaving a few seconds off
PS4Deals,30piic,pr0adam,2,Mon Mar 30 22:16:01 2015 UTC,"PS4 only uses SATA 2 anyway, so a SSHD is actually the best option for cost/space/performance boost"
PS4Deals,30piic,anovaremnant,2,Thu Apr 2 15:07:04 2015 UTC,FYI: Best Buy stocks that same drive and they just price matched an in-store purchase for me. After tax I walked out with this for $84! So glad I didn't order this drive off Amazon for $94 on Friday.
PS4Deals,30piic,Mallion1,2,Mon Mar 30 20:57:57 2015 UTC,Is this 5400 or 7200 rpm?
PS4Deals,30piic,sun-up-sun-down,2,Tue Mar 31 13:31:50 2015 UTC,5400rpm but 64mb cache as opposed to the 8mb cache on the 500gb hdd the system comes with.
PS4Deals,30piic,Mallion1,1 point,Fri Apr 3 14:33:39 2015 UTC,Amazon's got it for the same price if you guys wanna get it there

PS4Deals,30oxug,L3Y3Z,11,Sun Mar 29 11:58:11 2015 UTC,"It's too bad they jacked some of the prices back up for this sale, although I guess you'd still be saving some money regardless. Definitely a better deal if you're looking to pick up two brand-new games though.  I'll be getting MLB 15: The Show for sure, but I'm not sure what else I would want. I'm not convinced I'm masochistic enough to tackle Bloodborne, even for $30."
PS4Deals,30oxug,coltsmetsfan614,3,Sun Mar 29 13:25:24 2015 UTC,Yeah I think I will be picking up mlb and bloodborne
PS4Deals,30oxug,coltsmetsfan614,2,Sun Mar 29 13:37:04 2015 UTC,"I started thinking about it, and even if I don't start Bloodborne for a while, $30 for it, brand new, is a steal. I'll probably just go with that."
PS4Deals,30oxug,ET3RNA4,11,Sun Mar 29 13:39:14 2015 UTC,"Amazing deal...going to Target now.  Edit: HOT DAMN! Got the last copy of BloodBorne and the last copy of Borderlands Collection. Talked to the employee and I asked him ""Does this work for pre-orders, just for giggles (expecting him to say no), and he called his manager over, and he told me that as long as you don't unwrap the game that you payed $60 and keep the receipt, you can get any game within 30 days and we will swap the 2 games!!!"" So i'm strongly considering not unwrapping bloodborne and getting MKX in 2 weeks, and I basically got Borderlands for $30!"
PS4Deals,30oxug,Lord_of_Womba,1 point,Sun Mar 29 14:58:13 2015 UTC,"Good to know. The only new games I want atm are Bloodborne and DS2:SotFS, and SotFS doesnt come out till after the sale ends. Then again then are the same sort of game so maybe it's better to just wait till one or both are cheaper."
PS4Deals,30oxug,mylivingeulogy,1 point,Wed Apr 1 10:24:02 2015 UTC,Wow I didn't know you could do that now I'm going to get bloodborne for 30$ and return a 60$ game when MKX releases thanks for posting this!
PS4Deals,30oxug,jcal0032,6,Sun Mar 29 15:08:47 2015 UTC,You guys are seriously missing out by not playing Bloodborne. It is hands down the most fun game that I've played on the ps4 so far.
PS4Deals,30oxug,ET3RNA4,2,Sun Mar 29 21:31:53 2015 UTC,Good to hear. Just bought my copy yesterday.  Hoping to be able to tear in this weekend.
PS4Deals,30oxug,Grizzled_Veteran,2,Wed Apr 1 17:32:29 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Just make sure to check that they will do it, because I feel like it varies from Target to Target."
PS4Deals,30oxug,wobel85,6,Sun Mar 29 17:40:10 2015 UTC,"I was literally getting out of my car to walk into Best Buy so I could purchase The Show when I thought of this thread.    I immediately got back in my car, drove to Target and jumped on this offer.  Nabbed MLB 15: The Show and Bloodborne.  Thanks big time /r/PS4Deals !!"
PS4Deals,30oxug,Skudruckus21,3,Wed Apr 1 14:17:32 2015 UTC,"What are the games that makes the deal worth it? They have to be recently released to be even a good deal. Most of these games are cheaper on Amazon.  Edit: I bought Bloodborne two days ago but never opened it, but I have the PSN card as well so i don't know if it's just a better deal to keep the card or return and do the b1g1 with Bloodborne instead?"
PS4Deals,30oxug,MexicanKnight14,3,Sun Mar 29 17:49:58 2015 UTC,I dont think you can return psn cards once you remove it from the store.
PS4Deals,30oxug,AnonymousInAtl,1 point,Tue Mar 31 01:42:32 2015 UTC,Probably not

PS4Deals,30oxug,AlonzoMoseley,0,Mon Mar 30 07:47:17 2015 UTC,Can price matched be used to get battlefield hardline for 39.99 and use this deal?

PS4Deals,30osbn,azane,1 point,Thu Apr 9 01:14:01 2015 UTC,good find. was gonna post this yesterday too. not bad for a game that just came out not even a few weeks ago.
PS4Deals,30osbn,gottheitis,1 point,Mon Mar 30 11:11:53 2015 UTC,Anyone have this? Like to know if it's better than 4.
PS4Deals,30osbn,WanderingBear_,1 point,Mon Mar 30 16:45:58 2015 UTC,It's different. Hard to compare the two in means of better or worse. Some new game modes that are fun. Not as buggy as 4. I miss my tanks though
PS4Deals,30osbn,Towelbit,2,Mon Mar 30 19:07:42 2015 UTC,See I actually just got a ps4 and don't have either. I've played 4 and I liked it. Can't decide if I wanna go with 4 or get this one since it's the new one though.
PS4Deals,30osbn,WanderingBear_,2,Mon Mar 30 19:19:55 2015 UTC,Well if you're feeling cheap then 4 may be the way to go. There have been sales for battlefield 4 and premium for $20. The premium includes a boat load of maps and battlepacks.  It's a tough choice to decide between the two. Oh and if you are a team death match fan than I would give hardline more time for updates. I just spawn and die because people sit there waiting for me.
PS4Deals,30osbn,Towelbit,3,Mon Mar 30 19:26:25 2015 UTC,"Alright, well I think you just answered my question then. Think I'll go with 4 and give hardline some time to update. Thanks!"
PS4Deals,30osbn,WanderingBear_,1 point,Mon Mar 30 19:33:35 2015 UTC,Have you tried Hardcore on TDM? It's fun as hell
PS4Deals,30osbn,_johnning,1 point,Sun Apr 5 22:17:16 2015 UTC,"I thought they were both fun. It really depends on what you prefer when you play. If you generally play as a footsoldier you might prefer hardline, but if you love mainly flying and using tanks then you will for sure prefer 4. Hardline has a much better singleplayer though."
PS4Deals,30osbn,mylivingeulogy,1 point,Sat Apr 4 03:58:35 2015 UTC,Well I went with 4. I found it on eBay for cheap and so far I like it. I'm not big on using the vehicles yet but I've only had it for a couple days so we'll see. I'm sure after awhile I'll get hardline too.
PS4Deals,30osbn,WanderingBear_,1 point,Sat Apr 4 04:19:00 2015 UTC,anywhere to get a cheap digital code though?  I live in AU and much cheaper to purchase digital codes from say amazon and activate them on my US account

PS4Deals,30mtto,Game_Caviar,3,Sat Mar 28 21:46:40 2015 UTC,Might have to pick up Far Cry
PS4Deals,30mtto,G4mbit,3,Sat Mar 28 20:58:21 2015 UTC,"Get Far Cry 4, it is the only game Ubisoft has released that has not been a disappointment and is actually good"
PS4Deals,30mtto,Tumaras,2,Sat Mar 28 23:01:28 2015 UTC,"Agree on Far Cry, if you like the Ubi-style of game it's pretty great.  It has made me realize how Watch Dogs/AC/Far Cry all kind of follow the same formula though.  But it's still very good and easily worth $24."
PS4Deals,30mtto,kilroyishere89,3,Sun Mar 29 00:25:52 2015 UTC,Can't tell if it's a good thing or a bad thing that Hardline has only been out for a few weeks and it is already being discounted this much.
PS4Deals,30mtto,Tumaras,1 point,Sun Mar 29 00:16:46 2015 UTC,"It could be had for under $40 for PC even before release, and with it kind of being a big enhanced stand-alone DLC in a way for BF4 it wasn't going to stay at $59 for as long as a typical big release.  I wouldn't be surprised to see it $20 within 2 months."
PS4Deals,30mtto,dark_delight,2,Sun Mar 29 00:28:51 2015 UTC,Damn.... Kinda wanna get Unity. How is it these days? Have a lot of the issues been ironed out?

PS4Deals,30nfys,ajcrossing,2,Sun Mar 29 00:52:29 2015 UTC,"It's good but kinda short, I'd say it's worth the $7.50 though. It's perfect if you plan on getting second son because the ending of this game leads right into the beginning of second son. If you beat first light you'll enjoy the story of second son a lot more too"
PS4Deals,30nfys,pr0adam,3,Sun Mar 29 01:10:07 2015 UTC,OK you sold me lol. That plus the 10% off and since i unfortunately missed out on this in ps+ I won't have to fear it going free in the future

PS4Deals,30nfys,SenorV,2,Sun Mar 29 03:45:21 2015 UTC,"I know, it was a typo. IF it was never a PS+ game."
PS4Deals,30nfys,OriginalUneeK,1 point,Sun Mar 29 13:34:18 2015 UTC,"So I have both, grabbed first light during the deal. Should I just start second son over and beat first light first?  I'm literally maybe an hour in including cut scenes."
PS4Deals,30nfys,wdouglass,1 point,Wed Apr 1 15:20:26 2015 UTC,"Nah, finish second son first. It came out first, after all"
PS4Deals,30nfys,Onionsteak,1 point,Sat Apr 4 10:54:05 2015 UTC,"It's good, the story is short, though infamous never really had overly interesting storylines anyway. Unlike the order 1886 where when the story end the game pretty much ends you get to freeroam seattle for as long as you want after the ending, and do sidequests if that's your thing, If that's not enough there's the battle arena (that you can replay) and challenges, it's a fantastic addition to the main game that genuinely adds extra hours of gameplay.  Also Fetch's powers are better and more fun than Delson's (Second son) imo."
PS4Deals,30nfys,the_rman,1 point,Mon Mar 30 01:08:43 2015 UTC,Wow I'm just 1$ short to buy this game. -.-

PS4Deals,30nfys,Johnny_Guano,1 point,Sun Mar 29 14:20:46 2015 UTC,Does this mean this will be a PS+ game next month or near future? I still have barely started 2nd Son - it is a really cool game but the game here is 'deal' hunting after all.
PS4Deals,30nfys,pr0adam,5,Sun Mar 29 02:48:33 2015 UTC,It already was a ps+ game
PS4Deals,30nfys,Johnny_Guano,1 point,Sun Mar 29 03:01:18 2015 UTC,oh ... darn. I just got my PS4 less than a month ago. So should I spring for it or do they put these on PS+ again? How does that usu. work? Keep in mind I am new to PS.
PS4Deals,30nfys,pr0adam,2,Sun Mar 29 03:08:01 2015 UTC,"I'm about 99% sure that if a title has came on ps+ once it will not appear on ps+ again, that would be somewhat unfair to long time subscribers. I'd say go for it. $6 and change with the 10% off code, can't really go wrong imo. I just bought it. It may end up being $5 at best later down the line but I'd say that  this is a good price"

I got them to apply it to a game so I walked out with Far Cry 4 as well.  Thank you SO MUCH for posting this OP. Really made picking a PS4 bundle easy."
PS4Deals,30krdz,apostledeets,2,Sun Mar 29 06:01:43 2015 UTC,"No problem, glad you got hooked up! FYI, Far Cry 4 goes on sale at Best Buy for $29.99 tomorrow (Sunday), I'd go back and have them price match your game even lower and get some credit back."
PS4Deals,30krdz,Thoughtless-Choice,1 point,Sun Mar 29 06:41:21 2015 UTC,They matched it. Got it for $10. Incredible deal. Thanks again!!
PS4Deals,30krdz,aperks,1 point,Sun Mar 29 20:37:12 2015 UTC,That's awesome! Bloodborne and Far Cry 4 for a combined $10? I'd say you did quite well. :)
PS4Deals,30krdz,VeinerSchnitzel,2,Sun Mar 29 21:33:24 2015 UTC,Your mileage may vary- I went to BB and Target and both told me they don't price match promotions.
PS4Deals,30krdz,SavinThatBacon,1 point,Sun Mar 29 18:39:24 2015 UTC,Think they would give me store credit for another item?  I need to get a new PSU for my desktop

PS4Deals,30i5b0,Aram_Fingal,7,Fri Mar 27 20:08:06 2015 UTC,"Great game, not the best price.  I got it for less in December."
PS4Deals,30i5b0,taylorxo,1 point,Fri Mar 27 17:03:42 2015 UTC,$24 with GCU for a video game is a bad price? Fuck me then
PS4Deals,30i5b0,ProfessorChaos5049,1 point,Sat Mar 28 03:01:35 2015 UTC,I paid something similar of that on PC. I really really enjoyed the game but I beat it in 15 hours or so. After that there's not a whole lot of replay value.
PS4Deals,30i5b0,Secret_of_Mana,2,Sat Mar 28 13:48:41 2015 UTC,Is this online only?
PS4Deals,30i5b0,FrostyJesus,1 point,Fri Mar 27 17:02:21 2015 UTC,It is not on sale at my local Best Buy. Must be online only.
PS4Deals,30i5b0,Biggus_TM,1 point,Fri Mar 27 22:00:31 2015 UTC,They price match their website.
PS4Deals,30i5b0,Sheffield178,1 point,Sat Mar 28 06:31:50 2015 UTC,No the only online features it has is being able to kill an a NPC that killed someone on your friends list.
PS4Deals,30i5b0,Secret_of_Mana,3,Fri Mar 27 18:20:37 2015 UTC,I took his question as asking if the deal was online only (as opposed to in store) and was very confused at your reply!
PS4Deals,30i5b0,Biggus_TM,2,Fri Mar 27 18:23:35 2015 UTC,I paid for my copy online and will be picking it up from the store in a few hours.  I will respond to your post when I get to there if it is on sale or not
PS4Deals,30i5b0,DudeGuy123,1 point,Fri Mar 27 18:25:24 2015 UTC,You are correct

PS4Deals,30i5b0,woahitsmagic,2,Fri Mar 27 19:25:11 2015 UTC,Dead at Best Buy. But alive on Amazon.
PS4Deals,30i5b0,thedumbprogrammer,1 point,Sat Mar 28 15:00:40 2015 UTC,"I'm going to get this game, but I'm still playing Bloodborne so I probably wouldn't play it for a little while anyway.  Is it smart to grab it now, or do you guys think it will be cheaper within the next few months (physical, not digital)??"
PS4Deals,30i5b0,shawdo29,2,Fri Mar 27 17:57:41 2015 UTC,"I'd say wait. You can get the game for $20-$25 on eBay already, by the time you're done with Bloodborne the price will mostly likely drop a bit more."
PS4Deals,30i5b0,Inframidi,1 point,Fri Mar 27 18:59:20 2015 UTC,I ranked in about 60 hours in this game before trading it in.
PS4Deals,30hgvn,swotam,1 point,Fri Mar 27 12:34:58 2015 UTC,Available online and for in-store pickup.
PS4Deals,30hgvn,SteeezyE,0,Fri Mar 27 12:35:22 2015 UTC,"I think it's 20 at Walmart in the states  edit: my bad, it was the x one version"
PS4Deals,30hglw,swotam,2,Fri Mar 27 12:31:39 2015 UTC,"Available online and for in-store pickup. Also on sale at Real Canadian Superstore locations in Ontario for $35 if you have one nearby and you may be able to get Best Buy Canada and Futureshop to price match if you have their flyer.  Don't let the online stupidity about the game length and other nonsense sway your opinion if you haven't played this. It's an excellent game, especially at this price. It's unfortunate that we'll probably never see a sequel thanks to the Internet in general and morons on YouTube specifically."
PS4Deals,30hglw,RoundMound0fRebound,1 point,Fri Mar 27 12:32:54 2015 UTC,Down to $35 on Amazon.ca too. I'll be picking it up this weekend

PS4Deals,30evcb,bonzo21xx,3,Fri Mar 27 06:33:03 2015 UTC,Getting the digital version in countries like Canada is actually beneficial. With tax it comes out to be around $80 if you buy it in stores. The game with the discount on the sony store is 62$. Digital can actually be worth it
PS4Deals,30evcb,reesepeterson1,2,Fri Mar 27 01:15:03 2015 UTC,and I spent $120 on the store last night.   Oops
PS4Deals,30evcb,Addfwyn,1 point,Fri Mar 27 13:52:18 2015 UTC,Try contacting support and asking if they'll refund you the difference. I've had some companies do that a few times and the worse they'll say is no.
PS4Deals,30evcb,Lord_of_Womba,1 point,Fri Mar 27 06:22:37 2015 UTC,I just bought Bloodborne not knowing about this... -.-

PS4Deals,30evcb,drabar12,2,Fri Mar 27 03:17:53 2015 UTC,"It certainly will be. If you have GCU, it will actually be $32 + tax.  Also, next week Target will be having B1G1 50% off ALL video games, so keep that in mind."
PS4Deals,30evcb,DreadMcLaren,0,Fri Mar 27 05:23:18 2015 UTC,"Yaa, im Canadian, figured that wasnt going to happen here but it turns out its on sale for $49.99 here! Missed out.."

PS4Deals,309wp3,Josh_ftw,5,Wed Mar 25 17:42:50 2015 UTC,"The bonus game choice kind of sucks (Watch Dogs or Need for Speed), but you can always trade it in. The extra controller makes this a nice deal though."

PS4Deals,309wp3,SavinThatBacon,2,Wed Mar 25 20:46:36 2015 UTC,I finally pulled the trigger and ordered this bundle. A big thank you to everyone on this subreddit (:
PS4Deals,309wp3,insomniacsheep,1 point,Thu Mar 26 10:59:32 2015 UTC,Is this an online only or in store also?
PS4Deals,309wp3,WafoStyle,1 point,Wed Mar 25 19:56:50 2015 UTC,I'd imagine even if it's not in store they'll match it on site.
PS4Deals,309wp3,Mrbadexample86,2,Thu Mar 26 00:17:56 2015 UTC,The store I went to yesterday told me online only. 😢
PS4Deals,309wp3,PrologueEpilogue,1 point,Fri Mar 27 14:11:16 2015 UTC,I bought the same bundle on sunday minus the choice of game.
PS4Deals,309wp3,Fanboy0550,1 point,Wed Mar 25 20:59:34 2015 UTC,I wish someone would make a bundle with MLB 15...
PS4Deals,309wp3,cstater,2,Wed Mar 25 22:37:40 2015 UTC,I'm surprised that Sony doesn't do a MLB bundle every year.  They've got the only game in town and it is always well-made.  Why not take advantage of that?  They could also bundle in a discounted mlb.tv subscription to make it even more tempting.
PS4Deals,309wp3,OneLuckyContestant,1 point,Thu Mar 26 15:06:09 2015 UTC,"Because they can get people to buy the game standalone, or the system for the game."

PS4Deals,309wp3,wordupsucka,2,Fri Mar 27 14:35:52 2015 UTC,This or the Bloodborne bundle on Amazon.
PS4Deals,309wp3,apostledeets,2,Fri Mar 27 18:49:03 2015 UTC,I'd still have to say that this bundle is better since it comes with an extra controller...  Although tax cab also be a consideration depending on jurisdiction.
PS4Deals,309wp3,ManWithAPIan,1 point,Sat Mar 28 02:10:22 2015 UTC,They just updated this deal and added COD: Advanced Warfare

PS4Deals,300ubc,lexman02,2,Mon Mar 23 18:57:58 2015 UTC,This should so be a top deal
PS4Deals,300ubc,Marvin_rock,1 point,Mon Mar 23 21:06:18 2015 UTC,"Snagged 2, my jank was almost up, and I KNOW I'll use it that long."
PS4Deals,300ubc,hypnopoo,1 point,Mon Mar 23 17:36:37 2015 UTC,"Nice. That last sale was endless frustration, so I'm happy to have actually gotten one this time around."
PS4Deals,300ubc,Johnny_Guano,2,Mon Mar 23 18:07:45 2015 UTC,The one with the Visa checkout coupon code? It sure was.
PS4Deals,300ubc,hypnopoo,1 point,Mon Mar 23 19:48:49 2015 UTC,That would be the one.
PS4Deals,300ubc,Torrises,1 point,Mon Mar 23 20:09:54 2015 UTC,How long approximately would it take to come in? Want to have psplus for Bloodborne.
PS4Deals,300ubc,Inframidi,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:55:29 2015 UTC,I bought one and it said it'll arrive in 1-2 weeks.
PS4Deals,300ubc,laccro,1 point,Tue Mar 24 00:32:07 2015 UTC,I got mine in 3 days. Check your mail boxes!

PS4Deals,300ubc,Soltanus,1 point,Mon Mar 23 19:21:27 2015 UTC,"Iirc, there was a sale a couple years ago for 20-25 bucks and some guy had a screenshot of like 10+ years when his ps+ would expire. I think it was in r/playstationplus or r/ps3."
PS4Deals,300ubc,separate_realities,1 point,Tue Mar 24 11:49:54 2015 UTC,Thanks op. My plus sub runs out next month and I was starting to sweat about finding a deal.
PS4Deals,300ubc,naylord,1 point,Mon Mar 23 20:05:24 2015 UTC,I picked one up.  Thanks
PS4Deals,300ubc,Lord_of_Womba,1 point,Mon Mar 23 20:40:49 2015 UTC,"I was about to buy this and then realized it's in the US and not in canada, and then I realized, this is what our ps+ is like all the time now! For anyone wanting cheap ps+, just make a canadian account. It takes 1.3 cad dollars to get one us dollar so 50 CAD is less than 40 USD and yet ps+ is still 50 CAD"
PS4Deals,300ubc,happyfamily1234,1 point,Tue Mar 24 01:50:58 2015 UTC,"I hate having two subscriptions haha (xbl gold and ps+), but what can you do. $40 is the best I've seen aside from $30 on black friday sales."
PS4Deals,300ubc,chickencordonbleu,1 point,Tue Mar 24 02:16:47 2015 UTC,I have a question.  I feel like you folks know this.  So I just bought this and it said it'll be here on the 31st.  My 3 month subscription runs out on the 29th.  What happens to all my saved ps plus games if my membership lapses by two days?
PS4Deals,300ubc,Inframidi,1 point,Tue Mar 24 02:51:11 2015 UTC,"I turned off auto renewal earlier in the year. I attempted to play a game with a friend and it notified me that I needed PS+, which had run out a couple of days earlier. I just went through the prompts to renew and have been playing (including all my previous PS+ games) like nothing happened."
PS4Deals,300ubc,yunj001,-1,Tue Mar 24 15:39:58 2015 UTC,"I believe you lose the licenses to the games. If you know your membership won't be delivered in time, I would recommend investing in a 1 month PS+ membership in order to make sure you keep your games."
PS4Deals,300ubc,Dark-stone,4,Tue Mar 24 03:05:57 2015 UTC,He'll keep his games but wont be able to play them. He'll probably just have to restore the licenses when he renews two days later.
PS4Deals,300ubc,Fanboy0550,1 point,Tue Mar 24 03:08:52 2015 UTC,fuck i wish something this good would come to canada.

PS4Deals,3024z8,lexman02,2,Mon Mar 23 21:30:45 2015 UTC,$350 now.
PS4Deals,3024z8,OutlawFMA,1 point,Wed Mar 25 19:47:17 2015 UTC,"Fuuuuu bought it yesterday. Oh well, $10 isn't much and no tax so this was a great deal."
PS4Deals,3024z8,Heavencloud,2,Wed Mar 25 21:48:31 2015 UTC,Their daily promotional email says they're refunding the difference.
PS4Deals,2zwpda,DreadMcLaren,4,Sun Mar 22 15:07:26 2015 UTC,ADDITIONAL: GTA V is also 39.99 on Amazon
PS4Deals,2zwpda,kjh780,3,Tue Mar 24 01:54:58 2015 UTC,There is an advertisted sale on psn for the gta franchise in a few weeks. Idk if it will go lower than this but I am going to hold out for now.
PS4Deals,2zwpda,Brick50,2,Sun Mar 22 22:58:03 2015 UTC,How do you know? I bought gta5 a few days ago and wish I would have known it would be going on sale.
PS4Deals,2zwpda,dehli,4,Sun Mar 22 23:00:14 2015 UTC,It is advertised on the spring break thingy. Every week till mid april a different franchise is going on sale. I havnt been keeping up with it but I know one of the first weeks of april is gta. It is US only however. Edit: http://blog.us.playstation.com/2015/02/26/spring-fever-2015-8-weeks-8-new-ps4-games-ps-plus-discounts/
PS4Deals,2zwpda,Brick50,3,Sun Mar 22 23:04:44 2015 UTC,"Not likely it'll go that low on PSN, they hate giving solid discounts on popular games until a lot of time has gone by. The last 2 times they've had a ""sale"" on GTAV all they've done is charged full price for the game and thrown in a free Bull Shark Card (worth $10), which isn't much use unless you play the online portion, and doesn't cost Sony or R* anything since it's just virtual currency.  It would be nice if it went on sale for a decent price, as I'm wanting to get it when it does. Not holding my breath though..."
PS4Deals,2zwpda,swotam,2,Mon Mar 23 13:36:10 2015 UTC,Walmart price matched for me when I showed them the online ad.
PS4Deals,2zwpda,yourhometownsucks,1 point,Sun Mar 22 21:17:01 2015 UTC,"Let's submit this to Amazon so that they will price match!  Edit:  I bought it on amazon and immediately contacted them saying that I had found it for cheaper.  The first lady told me they don't do that (and her tone of voice didn't seem as if she was the type to budge from her stance) so I called back again and got a different rep.  He told me the same thing but I told him: ""I know how your business works and I am sure you can do something for me."" He put me on hold and gave me the difference.  Just be nice but firm.  Amazon doesn't like losing business.  tl;dr Amazon Prime! WHOO!"
PS4Deals,2zwpda,rheeddiddi,1 point,Sun Mar 22 17:40:42 2015 UTC,How do you go about that? Do you just chat an Amazon support member?
PS4Deals,2zwpda,PercussiveScruf,1 point,Sun Mar 22 17:42:35 2015 UTC,"On the Amazon full product page, under Product Details, there is a link that says ""tell us about a lower price.""  Do it!"
PS4Deals,2zwpda,rheeddiddi,1 point,Sun Mar 22 18:09:33 2015 UTC,How would you know they accepted it?
PS4Deals,2zwpda,DirtyMuffin-,1 point,Sun Mar 22 22:48:27 2015 UTC,I did a couple hours ago.
PS4Deals,2zwpda,Maxxhat,1 point,Sun Mar 22 17:47:48 2015 UTC,Son of a bitch I bought mine last saturday for 52.99 on Best Buy. Fuck me. Edit: anyone know if they'll refund me?
PS4Deals,2zwpda,Maxxhat,1 point,Tue Mar 24 00:31:13 2015 UTC,"Go to Best Buy with your receipt, show them the ad and price at Target and they will refund the difference."
PS4Deals,2zwpda,CheetoFinger_lick,1 point,Tue Mar 24 00:53:32 2015 UTC,sooooo what if I lost the receipt already? :/ I carded it though so they should have a record.
PS4Deals,2zwpda,linusnc,1 point,Tue Mar 24 00:57:46 2015 UTC,"If you have a MyBestBuy account and used it during that purchase, it will be tied to that account."
PS4Deals,2zxs2b,DreadMcLaren,2,Sun Mar 22 20:35:27 2015 UTC,Is it worth it?
PS4Deals,2zxs2b,lapride7,5,Mon Mar 23 02:11:05 2015 UTC,Very short story line and the online mp seems to work 1 out of every 100 times. Also if you want a max level car expect to grind for a couple hours doing jumps and other random challenges. Also if you do manage to get online with out a max level car it wont be too much fun as it is a pay to win game.
PS4Deals,2zxs2b,knowshame,4,Mon Mar 23 05:27:28 2015 UTC,"Ehhh. It might be at 30 bucks, but I would recommend DriveClub over this."
PS4Deals,2zwklw,joker5527,11,Sun Mar 22 14:16:36 2015 UTC,Might get bestbuy to price match for gcu points
PS4Deals,2zwklw,BlackEleanor68,5,Sun Mar 22 17:08:16 2015 UTC,Best Buy will actually have the game on sale starting March 29 for the same price. That way you'll be able to use the GCU as well.
PS4Deals,2zwklw,Shadowlink_1990,2,Mon Mar 23 05:48:27 2015 UTC,So gcu saves you money on sale games? Didn't know that
PS4Deals,2zwklw,je66b,4,Mon Mar 23 14:44:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, as long as it's a sale they are having on their own and not one caused by a coupon or price match."
PS4Deals,2zwklw,Shadowlink_1990,1 point,Mon Mar 23 19:31:41 2015 UTC,Well fuck lol
PS4Deals,2zwklw,BlackEleanor68,2,Mon Mar 23 14:59:44 2015 UTC,I should have thought of this.
PS4Deals,2zwklw,BlackEleanor68,1 point,Sun Mar 22 17:25:35 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah man, also bestbuy does price match amazon if it is sold by amazon"
PS4Deals,2zwklw,digitalgoodtime,1 point,Sun Mar 22 19:10:07 2015 UTC,Would Best Buy price match AND offer the GCU discount?  Making it 15.99?
PS4Deals,2zwklw,RockTheShaz,2,Sun Mar 22 22:09:28 2015 UTC,From what I heard no but I don't have GCU
PS4Deals,2zwklw,BlackEleanor68,2,Sun Mar 22 22:37:45 2015 UTC,Not on price matches but I think you get the triple points tho
PS4Deals,2zwklw,Inframidi,2,Sun Mar 22 22:50:19 2015 UTC,Just wait til next week. BB will have it on sale for $19.99 and GCU brings it down to $15.99.
PS4Deals,2zwklw,digitalgoodtime,1 point,Mon Mar 23 15:11:00 2015 UTC,"yep, gonna wait.  thanks."
PS4Deals,2zwklw,Inframidi,1 point,Mon Mar 23 15:15:24 2015 UTC,They'll also have BF: Hardline for $39.99 ($32 with GCU).
PS4Deals,2zwklw,digitalgoodtime,3,Mon Mar 23 16:20:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks, but I have BF4 Premium and I'm gonna pass on Hardline."
PS4Deals,2zwklw,Inframidi,1 point,Mon Mar 23 16:29:43 2015 UTC,No prob.
PS4Deals,2zwklw,poisonedpanda,2,Mon Mar 23 16:31:20 2015 UTC,Is it worth picking up at 20 dollars?
PS4Deals,2zwklw,insane08,4,Sun Mar 22 15:35:38 2015 UTC,I'll let you know tonight. Havn't played it yet.
PS4Deals,2zwklw,flyufools,3,Sun Mar 22 15:56:27 2015 UTC,please report back
PS4Deals,2zwklw,sempiturtle,5,Mon Mar 23 01:29:09 2015 UTC,"Are you guys really waiting with bated breath at OP's opinion of the game? I mean, reviews exist, ya'll. Credible sources have talked a lot about the game on the Internet. Ya'll are acting silly for real."
PS4Deals,2zwklw,DoctorDank,4,Wed Mar 25 22:35:25 2015 UTC,Longer day than planned and had to rebuild database ps4 kept freezing ill let you know tomorrow sorry
PS4Deals,2zwklw,Ikarus3426,5,Mon Mar 23 03:41:27 2015 UTC,"yes, absolutely. the DLC they gave for free is worth $20 easy. so think of it as yourself buying the full game with an added bonus of more story and a bigger map to explore. seriously, the map is HUGE."
PS4Deals,2zwklw,SenorV,5,Mon Mar 23 02:33:19 2015 UTC,I bought it for $35 a couple weeks ago. Totally worth it. I really am enjoying it.
PS4Deals,2zwklw,PM_ME_YOUR_CRELBOW,4,Mon Mar 23 04:34:33 2015 UTC,Absolutely. Plenty of gameplay.
PS4Deals,2zwklw,je66b,2,Sun Mar 22 23:56:59 2015 UTC,"Just a reminder, the Dead Kings DLC is free."
PS4Deals,2zwklw,jpchubbs,3,Sun Mar 22 18:14:20 2015 UTC,Underground Armory is free as well.
PS4Deals,2zwklw,BenderB-Rodriguez,2,Mon Mar 23 00:58:58 2015 UTC,"After playing for a few hours, the framerate issues are not my biggest complaint. While free running I notice the main character doing movements I did not even come close to trying to do. Compared to Black Flag, the free running seems much more clumsy. The load times are horrendous as well. I've been starting up videos on youtube between sequences. I am debating trading this in at Bestbuy and taking the 3$ hit on value."
PS4Deals,2zwklw,Ikarus3426,1 point,Wed Mar 25 10:19:56 2015 UTC,How long is this on sale for??
PS4Deals,2zwklw,DoctorDank,2,Sun Mar 22 23:23:48 2015 UTC,I would guess 1 week
PS4Deals,2zwklw,mrbearbear,1 point,Mon Mar 23 00:09:32 2015 UTC,"Just checked, 20 bucks on amazon too."
PS4Deals,2zwklw,Gcoks,-8,Tue Mar 24 00:36:59 2015 UTC,still an insanley broken game
PS4Deals,2zwklw,mrbearbear,3,Sun Mar 22 16:40:06 2015 UTC,Insanely broken? I heard there are still some fps drops but I havn't heard the word broken to describe this game for a while.
PS4Deals,2zwklw,hardangelfan,4,Sun Mar 22 17:26:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how it is for PC, but it runs fine on PS4 now. I rarely noticed pop in from NPCs and it never caused a problem. The only time I saw FPS drops was when I was syncing an area, and that's just a cinematic thing, didn't hurt the gameplay at all. The only problem I had was missing a few jumps that I shouldn't have and random NPCs doing weird things, which wasn't really game breaking and was easily forgettable against the rest of the game."
PS4Deals,2zwklw,Ikarus3426,2,Mon Mar 23 00:00:39 2015 UTC,"Other than the occasional FPS drops, it's great. Not broken at all. I very much enjoy it"
PS4Deals,2zwklw,hardangelfan,-1,Mon Mar 23 04:35:17 2015 UTC,"Well if the fps drops are still the same, that would be a deal breaker."
PS4Deals,2zwklw,Ikarus3426,-1,Sun Mar 22 18:40:53 2015 UTC,"Nah, it's like you're playing old school! I never mind FPS dips because that crap used to happen all the time."
PS4Deals,2zwklw,hardangelfan,-2,Sun Mar 22 19:21:04 2015 UTC,I can't justify sub 10fps for a game.
PS4Deals,2zvyfv,sachcha90,7,Sun Mar 22 07:55:47 2015 UTC,Is it worth it at this price? I've only read bad reviews about this game but I've played all the AC games.
PS4Deals,2zvyfv,tinmoreno,9,Sun Mar 22 18:13:02 2015 UTC,"I've played every assassin's creed game to date and to be honest unless you're a huge fan like me, I wouldn't recommend this for even $20. Of course the glitches and stuff ruin the game but the worst part is the game feels so slow and tied down. You can't run through the city because there's so many people, the combat system changed to a slower pace, the pay to win aspect pisses me off when you already paid $60 for the game (there's a feature in the game like a candy crush feature where you can pay real world money to upgrade your character) the game is flawed around that system and trying to make the world too real. I consider it one of the worst games in the series. AC4BF was in my opinion the best in the series. Hope this helped!"
PS4Deals,2zvyfv,Akashady47,2,Sun Mar 22 20:57:38 2015 UTC,"Personally, It's my second favourite in the series. First being AC2 but that's only because it was my entry into the series. Unity focuses more on letting you play how you want, you feel very underpowered in the beginning but that slowly becomes the opposite as you buy new equipment.   I wouldn't worry about micro transactions because everything gives you a ton of money. Speaking of, there is a ton of content in this game. A large amount of missions, some not so great while others are very enjoyable. In regards to the glitches and FPS drops, I don't experience any really other than AI pop in but it doesn't detract too much. I think if you like the early games in the AC series you'll love this game, but if you preferred Black Flag (Which I personally hated) it might not be for you."
PS4Deals,2zvyfv,IAmYouAYA,5,Sun Mar 22 22:37:57 2015 UTC,That's the price I was waiting for!
PS4Deals,2zvyfv,anduin2000,2,Sun Mar 22 16:06:00 2015 UTC,Snagged one. Thanks!
PS4Deals,2zvyfv,yourcousinsannem,1 point,Sun Mar 22 18:38:10 2015 UTC,Is it a CD or digital?
PS4Deals,2zvyfv,gorte1ec,-4,Sun Mar 22 23:36:07 2015 UTC,"I can literally get this for 4 dollars with my Amazon rewards points, but I'm still not sure if it's worth it when I barely made it through Black Flag. The cool thing is Amazon will accept returns if I don't like it.  I'm torn between this and Far Cry 4 (I'm not a fan of FPS). Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated."
PS4Deals,2zu0x7,Golden_Taint,12,Sat Mar 21 19:39:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this post, make this a weekly thing!"
PS4Deals,2zu0x7,TheNAC,11,Sat Mar 21 20:01:05 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely going to. The other post I made had such a good reaction, I decided to make it a weekly thing. Now that GCU is $30 permanently, it's way more accessible and the percent of /r/PS4Deal users who have it should be pretty high."
PS4Deals,2zu0x7,ihavepaper,2,Sat Mar 21 20:04:13 2015 UTC,"i barely bought the GCU today. Bloodborne was only $51 with tax, which isn't bad at all. saved 12. Near half of what GCU cost me. And i know for a fact that i'm going to purchase a bunch more games this year."

PS4Deals,2zu0x7,kilroyishere89,5,Sat Mar 21 21:29:26 2015 UTC,"Mine, too. The cashier rang it up as a gift instead of for myself, even though she asked who it was for. I didn't realize it wasn't activated properly until I was shopping on their website and it wouldn't work. So I called BB customer service and they said the only way it could get activated is if I went to the store. So I had to drive all the way back to my local BB, which is a pain in the ass."

PS4Deals,2zu0x7,dehli,1 point,Sun Mar 22 03:22:54 2015 UTC,Can you purchase these games digitally at these prices?
PS4Deals,2zu0x7,whitey182,2,Sat Mar 21 23:02:17 2015 UTC,"Nope. There's very few actual authorized dealers for digital games, mainly Sony direct or Amazon."
PS4Deals,2zu0x7,whitey182,1 point,Sun Mar 22 06:35:37 2015 UTC,For the GCU is it a discount on all video games or only new/select titles?
PS4Deals,2zu0x7,whitey182,1 point,Sat Mar 21 23:48:37 2015 UTC,"All video games. New (not used) games are 20% off, used games are 10% off. This discount stacks with any sales all year including Black Friday."
PS4Deals,2zu0x7,cali_gunner,1 point,Sat Mar 21 23:56:09 2015 UTC,Will they price match a game and then add the discount on top of it?
PS4Deals,2zu0x7,cali_gunner,1 point,Sun Mar 22 01:30:13 2015 UTC,No. They do price match but you can't stack it with your discount. That's why it's good to keep track of the sales that Best Buy offers because GCU makes those sales so much better.
PS4Deals,2zu0x7,cali_gunner,1 point,Sun Mar 22 02:22:53 2015 UTC,Got it got it. Thanks for the info !
PS4Deals,2zu0x7,BlitzKraig1,-1,Sun Mar 22 02:57:42 2015 UTC,"This isn't true - I've had two Best Buys say it's policy that the discount stacks to price matching and one said they'll make an exception for me. Glendale/South Coast Plaza are down with the policy, Westminster Mall has to be wrassled into submission."
PS4Deals,2zu0x7,BlitzKraig1,2,Sun Mar 22 19:12:14 2015 UTC,"It is true. It is absolutely official policy that they do not stack. The computer system has been programmed to remove the GCU discount if a price match adjustment is made. You may have found a couple employees that will knowingly or unknowingly break policy for you, it doesn't change the  policy or the experience that the vast majority of GCU members will have."
PS4Deals,2zu0x7,G0VERNMENTCHEESE,-1,Sun Mar 22 20:11:52 2015 UTC,I got them to price match a used game with a new game price since they were out of new copies and I got a stacked discount on that too - for the Metro deal yesterday/Friday.
PS4Deals,2zu0x7,Anersha,-2,Sun Mar 22 20:26:09 2015 UTC,"yesterday a literal manager came over and told me that it is policy that it stacks and that there is a new system update this week that was causing errors. south coast plaza best buy. Also, since November, I've price matched and stacked every big release. today was the first time a cashier wasn't clear and I still got ACU price matched and stacked."
PS4Deals,2zu0x7,Anersha,4,Sun Mar 22 20:24:15 2015 UTC,"Here is their FAQ for the GCU program, it states clearly that price matches do not stack with GCU. I called my local store, they are aware of no policy change. Again, you might have a store that is not following the  policy, you're lucky. But 99% of people will not have that experience. So to tell me when I state their policy that it ""isn't true"" is just wrong."
PS4Deals,2zu0x7,Vaunz,1 point,Sun Mar 22 20:48:18 2015 UTC,"I also have a question about it, do you need to buy the games in-store? Or does the discount apply online as well?"
PS4Deals,2zu0x7,Vaunz,1 point,Sun Mar 22 02:32:26 2015 UTC,"You need to setup the account in-store, but once you have GCU you can absolutely use it online. After I log in, I see the discount right on the site."
PS4Deals,2zu0x7,MReprogle,1 point,Sun Mar 22 06:36:45 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty cool deal! I have a best buy nearby, but it's about a 20 minute drive, so if I only had to make the trip once that's easier. Thanks for the heads up!"
PS4Deals,2zu0x7,e_x_i_t,1 point,Sun Mar 22 14:06:16 2015 UTC,Next week there will be a B1G1 50% off at Target along with the PS4 TLoU bundle that comes with a $50 GC... I dont think Sony has ever done a GC deal with the PS4 before.
PS4Deals,2zu0x7,NightRed_,1 point,Sun Mar 22 05:58:24 2015 UTC,I bought destiny last week and want to get the price difference refund but I've already opened the game. Am I still eligible for the refund and will they only give me the normal price or the GCU price for this week (i've never done a price match refund before)
PS4Deals,2zsfci,-p3p3-,6,Sat Mar 21 08:02:47 2015 UTC,Bestbuy will pricematch
PS4Deals,2zsfci,Trrixx,2,Sat Mar 21 16:36:48 2015 UTC,BB would pricematch including shipping or would it be just $39.99?
PS4Deals,2zsfci,Kobeissi2,1 point,Sat Mar 21 17:26:46 2015 UTC,39.99 and tax if that applies to you
PS4Deals,2zsfci,Trrixx,1 point,Sat Mar 21 18:39:08 2015 UTC,"Just price matched it at Best Buy, $39.99 out the door.   Thanks OP!"

PS4Deals,2zsfci,ck2k15,5,Sun Mar 22 01:19:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much!  Does anyone know how long this sale will last (or when the sale started)? I can't find any info on that  I was planning on going to Best Buy or Target to get a price match tomorrow... because (1) I don't have to pay $5 shipping, and (2) I live in the city and people tend to steal packages here...  If not, I'll have to get it shipped"
PS4Deals,2zsfci,belligerentsince1989,2,Sun Mar 22 02:00:11 2015 UTC,just ordered one... so pumped I saved money

PS4Deals,2zqlp3,wolfzr2,10,Fri Mar 20 20:36:44 2015 UTC,"Good deal.   Although, If you want it new, it's only available for In Store Pickup.  Edit: If you use coupon code CAG16 when you checkout, you can get the USED copy for $23.51."
PS4Deals,2zqlp3,DreadMcLaren,2,Fri Mar 20 20:54:18 2015 UTC,How does my Gamestop not have it new or used!?!?
PS4Deals,2zqlp3,TheNAC,4,Fri Mar 20 21:42:38 2015 UTC,"Price match it at Best Buy, Walmart or Target."
PS4Deals,2zqlp3,DreadMcLaren,4,Fri Mar 20 21:48:24 2015 UTC,Decided to buy for $22 with free shipping used at Gamestop.
PS4Deals,2zqlp3,TheNAC,3,Fri Mar 20 22:58:25 2015 UTC,"Good call. Nothing different between new or used, other than it being opened already. I'd recommend getting the season pass when you get it. You'll get all the extra content they have for the game and their is another expansion pack coming out next week."
PS4Deals,2zqlp3,DreadMcLaren,2,Fri Mar 20 23:01:55 2015 UTC,Will do.  I heard the season pass is awesome and best value around.
PS4Deals,2zqlp3,TheNAC,1 point,Sat Mar 21 01:02:17 2015 UTC,"I bought mine from gamestop and it had a sticker that said ""new"" on it, however it was already opened and the disc was in a separate sleeve in another drawer."
PS4Deals,2zqlp3,Medikated,1 point,Sun Mar 22 07:22:43 2015 UTC,I had the same thing happen. A friend picked it up for me since she was right next to the store and didn't know the difference. I ended up returning it and getting it price matched and still sealed at Best Buy. The same thing happens to a friend at Christmas. His was the box off the shelf as it was the last one. I have no idea how they get away with this. It's not new it's open boxed if anything.  I get it's never been used in that sense but who knows. I know it's minuscule but it just irked me a bit. Anyways sorry for the off topic rant and thanks for heads up on the deal! Been looking for a deal on this game.
PS4Deals,2zqlp3,nicotoroboto,2,Sun Mar 22 19:06:34 2015 UTC,Is Driveclub mainly focused for online play?
PS4Deals,2zqlp3,jasonjaema,2,Sat Mar 21 10:24:07 2015 UTC,No there are a LOT of offline races available. Online is some good fun tho.
PS4Deals,2zqlp3,ChrisWinterTBE,1 point,Sun Mar 22 17:04:39 2015 UTC,If you like ram fests. Though the time trial events are great.
PS4Deals,2zqlp3,ET3RNA4,2,Mon Mar 23 16:46:12 2015 UTC,Is this game worth $28?
PS4Deals,2zqlp3,progz,4,Sat Mar 21 02:11:20 2015 UTC,Absolutely yes.
PS4Deals,2zqlp3,Roseysdaddy,1 point,Sat Mar 21 04:05:29 2015 UTC,"I just bought it and yeah, id say yes. I was totally against it though before, and every thread that came out i said ""where da psn version?"""
PS4Deals,2zqlp3,progz,3,Sat Mar 21 06:49:46 2015 UTC,Based on what?  You just bought it as in an hour ago or three days ago?
PS4Deals,2zqlp3,Roseysdaddy,2,Sat Mar 21 22:55:52 2015 UTC,"I bought it early in the day like 2:02pm and i think i stopped playing at 5:07pm, is that detailed enough?"
PS4Deals,2zqlp3,TILearnedNothing,1 point,Sun Mar 22 01:24:41 2015 UTC,Seems like an incredibly short amount of time to go from totally against it to telling people on the internet to go out and buy it.
PS4Deals,2zqlp3,progz,1 point,Sun Mar 22 08:52:19 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I feel like some redditors are paid advertisements for the game."
PS4Deals,2zqlp3,Roseysdaddy,0,Thu Mar 26 02:35:13 2015 UTC,how do you know its a 'short' time though? what is 'short'?
PS4Deals,2zqlp3,intromatt,2,Sun Mar 22 16:04:27 2015 UTC,"Don't be ignorant, this isn't some sort of of existential question. Enough time would be enough to beat a majority of the game, which I'm guessing 3 hours ist enough for this game.  You wouldn't watch the first 20 minutes of a movie and tell people to go see it unless you're an asshole."
PS4Deals,2zqlp3,girlcockboycockEIEIO,1 point,Sun Mar 22 16:54:54 2015 UTC,I am really hoping someone could sell me a digital download code for under $30.

PS4Deals,2zqji5,Roseysdaddy,3,Sat Mar 21 12:28:31 2015 UTC,I've got a PS3 that plays PS2 and PS1 games. I'd sell my PS4 before I trade it in....not that anyone would give me a decent price for it anyway.

PS4Deals,2zplka,pr0adam,4,Fri Mar 20 20:18:39 2015 UTC,it will probably be free on ps plus within a year
PS4Deals,2zplka,Anersha,2,Fri Mar 20 23:00:03 2015 UTC,I doubt it considering it just came out not THAT long ago and it's been selling well.
PS4Deals,2zplka,Dirtrider2040,1 point,Fri Mar 20 23:03:09 2015 UTC,It's going to go lower. They gave away the old 2033 not too long ago. They've managed to get a lot of people to purchase the same games twice too.
PS4Deals,2zplka,Johnny_Guano,1 point,Sat Mar 21 04:25:48 2015 UTC,Selling so well it's getting marked down as low as $15 within a year of debuting at $50.
PS4Deals,2zplka,1on1withthegreat1,3,Fri Mar 20 23:15:38 2015 UTC,Last of Us Remastered came out about a year ago and is going on sale often for $20; are you going to argue that it is not selling well either?

PS4Deals,2zplka,slickestwood,2,Sat Mar 21 10:38:23 2015 UTC,Do they price match Toys R Us?
PS4Deals,2zplka,Golden_Taint,2,Sat Mar 21 11:03:46 2015 UTC,Yep.
PS4Deals,2zplka,TGrady902,1 point,Sat Mar 21 11:21:39 2015 UTC,Was all ready to scoop this but $6 shipping killed it for me.
PS4Deals,2zplka,Fmofdeath,2,Fri Mar 20 21:20:32 2015 UTC,"If there isn't a Toys'r'us near you, you can still price match it at a store that does price matches."
PS4Deals,2zplka,TGrady902,1 point,Sat Mar 21 02:00:02 2015 UTC,Can you do that online/ does wal mart or GameStop do price matching? I feel like GameStop doesn't.
PS4Deals,2zplka,rytron83,2,Sat Mar 21 02:14:02 2015 UTC,Wal mart will price match it so long as the listing doesn't say online only. I know this b/c I had them match this last night :)
PS4Deals,2zplka,Fmofdeath,2,Sat Mar 21 16:14:01 2015 UTC,"I believe Wal-Mart does price match. If you're looking to price match using another site, you will have to speak to someone through their customer service (Amazon for example) but otherwise, if you can go to say Wal-Mart, they can call Toys'r'us up to confirm the price since it's going for $14.99 in-store as well."

PS4Deals,2zplka,duvallg,1 point,Sat Mar 21 04:26:26 2015 UTC,Website said none in Stock when I checked today for my local store. Went to said store and there were two copies. Score.
PS4Deals,2zplka,indecisiveprick,1 point,Sun Mar 22 01:51:58 2015 UTC,"Awesome, price matched at BB. They didn't have it in stock at the store so they ordered it online for me to pick up Wednesday.   Skipped out on the $6 shipping by picking up in store too! Like $16.50 total for two games, not bad!"
PS4Deals,2zplka,Dann610,1 point,Sun Mar 22 04:38:35 2015 UTC,Price matched with Best Buy and used my $10 rewards certificate. Final total came out to around $5.

PS4Deals,2zpchw,swotam,2,Fri Mar 20 14:44:32 2015 UTC,"This is an Amazon.ca Featured Deal and is set to expire at 3:00 am (presumably March 21). Act fast! Best Buy Canada and Futureshop will price match this deal, bringing the price down to around $97  An excellent price on a 2TB external drive that can be easily removed from the casing and installed in a PS4. I picked one of these up a couple of weeks ago and did exactly that and it fits and works perfectly.  To remove the drive, carefully pry the metal top cover from the bottom plastic case. This can be done by hand or using a small screwdriver. Once the case is open, remove the drive and unplug from the USB interface board. Then just follow the Sony instructions for replacing the drive. Be sure to backup your game save data first so that it can be restored to the new drive afterwards.  The drive fits perfectly in the PS4 and meets the specs that Sony specifies for the console. If you're looking for extra storage in your PS4, this is a great way to expand at a reasonable price.  As an added bonus, you can install your old PS4 500GB drive in the case and use that as an external USB drive afterwards.  Edit: Our American friends can get the same drive from Amazon.com for $89 which is a pretty good deal."
PS4Deals,2zpchw,Dedale,1 point,Fri Mar 20 14:45:44 2015 UTC,weird... It sits in my basket for a week now at that price. I'm not sure why they say it's a flash deal as it was already at that same price.
PS4Deals,2zpchw,Dedale,1 point,Fri Mar 20 16:15:24 2015 UTC,"They have it listed on their Deals page, and the note indicates that the sale ends at 3:00 am. I know their regular price is around $120 since I checked a couple of weeks ago and that's what it was at the time.  You know Amazon, their pricing can be pretty unpredictable... Note that this is on the Canadian site, not the US one (they sell it for $89)."
PS4Deals,2zpchw,Dedale,1 point,Fri Mar 20 16:42:23 2015 UTC,"True. I'm still on the fence for this one... Decisions, decisions..."
PS4Deals,2zpchw,pr0adam,1 point,Fri Mar 20 17:25:45 2015 UTC,"Well, it is pretty darn cheap for that much extra storage. If you need the space now's as good a time as any..."
PS4Deals,2zpchw,Dedale,1 point,Fri Mar 20 17:42:53 2015 UTC,Yeah but after the little voice in my head tells me... You need another one for your ps3 and don't forget this 64gb for your vita as well...   And this is why I got those three things in my basket for a week now.
PS4Deals,2zpchw,pr0adam,1 point,Fri Mar 20 18:25:11 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm wrong but wouldn't the ps4 hdd fit in the ps3 one?  And I have a vita and had to settle for 32gb,  64gb price is just disgusting"

PS4Deals,2zo5p7,one800higgins,2,Fri Mar 20 17:09:57 2015 UTC,3 dollars a day!
PS4Deals,2zo5p7,Grape_Juice620,1 point,Fri Mar 20 17:20:43 2015 UTC,Sounds like a worthwhile $3! I will have to rent this next week.
PS4Deals,2zo5p7,one800higgins,2,Fri Mar 20 17:35:46 2015 UTC,You can reserve online. I just looked and it's easy to find in my area.
PS4Deals,2zo5p7,one800higgins,2,Fri Mar 20 22:24:31 2015 UTC,Its totally worth it great game it is sad that their wasn't more to it but I still enjoyed it immensely.
PS4Deals,2zo5p7,Grape_Juice620,1 point,Fri Mar 20 22:54:11 2015 UTC,I rented the Order for $3.29. Gamefly is having a month trial or two month trial for $10.
PS4Deals,2zo5p7,OmniDeus,2,Sat Mar 21 03:19:09 2015 UTC,Yeah I did the same right when it came out. I really enjoyed it too.. I just might rent it again to go for the platinum trophy.
PS4Deals,2zo5p7,shall_2,3,Fri Mar 20 17:42:28 2015 UTC,Is it worth it for $32? I haven't heard the best reviews about this game....
PS4Deals,2zo5p7,RidiculousNicholas55,3,Fri Mar 20 18:16:07 2015 UTC,"I went for it. You can trade it back in for 23 dollars right now, plus a 10% bonus, since you're a GCU member, if you play through it right away and don't want to hold onto it.  EDIT: it would actually be a 40% bonus if you trade it back in by Saturday night...30% trade in bonus this week + 10% GCU bonus."
PS4Deals,2zo5p7,swotam,1 point,Fri Mar 20 06:34:46 2015 UTC,"It's a very good game. Anyone who says otherwise didn't understand what RaD was trying to create with this IP. The general negativity is unwarranted IMO, and that moronic 5.5 hour nonsense on YouTube did the game a huge disservice without adding anything of value to the mix.  It's a showcase for what the PS4 is capable of, it's a fun game with a decent story and it's well worth this price, especially if you have the ability to trade it back for $25+. It's ""short"" in the grand scheme of things, but it's nowhere near 5.5 hours unless you are rushing the content on Easy. I've played the game, it took me 12 hours on Hard to get the Platinum, and that's perfectly fine by me."
PS4Deals,2zo5p7,laccro,2,Fri Mar 20 06:37:12 2015 UTC,"This may be worth it for $40, but it also may be more worth it when it finally drops down to $30 or lower... It probably won't take too much longer, either"
PS4Deals,2zo5p7,DoctorDank,1 point,Fri Mar 20 12:49:23 2015 UTC,"Yea didn't even take a month for it to go down to $40, so I very much doubt it'll take much longer to go to $30. I'm waiting for $20, personally."
PS4Deals,2zo5p7,johnwilliams713,1 point,Fri Mar 20 06:50:16 2015 UTC,Confirmed. Traded in Drive Club for $26 and put that towards The Order.
PS4Deals,2zo5p7,Uninhibited_,-1,Fri Mar 20 15:57:06 2015 UTC,Still too pricey for a film.

PS4Deals,2znqvu,rtfmoz,1 point,Fri Mar 20 02:45:21 2015 UTC,The $128 price tag is good in Australia at the moment for this portable hard disk. Ideal for PS4 upgrade liek the one I did myself recently. https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/2qvicw/ps4_2tb_upgrade_successful_and_simple_australia/
PS4Deals,2znqvu,tommybass,1 point,Fri Mar 20 02:46:17 2015 UTC,"Probably a stupid question, but is the OS on a separate disk or something?"
PS4Deals,2znqvu,swotam,2,Fri Mar 20 13:39:16 2015 UTC,"When you replace the drive in your PS4, you need to reinstall the OS by downloading the most recent firmware from Sony, copying it to a USB stick / drive, and then installing it on the system after the new drive is installed.  Keep in mind that replacing the drive is effectively the same as a full reset of the console, so all your settings will need to be reconfigured and all your games will need to be re-installed or downloaded if digital purchases, and patched again. It takes a while, but it's the only option at the moment.  Supposedly an upcoming firmware release for the PS4 will allow you to backup your games to an external USB device, but until it actually happens I'd take that with a grain of salt."
PS4Deals,2znqvu,tommybass,1 point,Fri Mar 20 15:12:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, i have been wanting to upgrade, but didn't know how to go about it but this thread has helped me greatly."

PS4Deals,2zhgtt,gio55583,1 point,Thu Mar 19 17:36:32 2015 UTC,"If BB price matched, that would be awesome with an additional 20% GCU."
PS4Deals,2zhgtt,dzordzyk,2,Thu Mar 19 16:05:01 2015 UTC,its either price match or GCU. they dont allow both.
PS4Deals,2zhgtt,gio55583,1 point,Thu Mar 19 20:53:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, but I guess if they would automatically price matched to Amazon (price on the website updated), then we would also be eligible for GCU. Is my understanding wrong?"

Personally bought from them once and had no issues."
PS4Deals,2zih1t,bigbeardbeatdwn,2,Thu Mar 19 02:34:08 2015 UTC,"I purchased a code for The Last of Us Remastered and the code did not work. I e-mailed their customer support, and although they weren't as fast responding to me as I would've liked, they definitely got me a replacement code that worked. I would say the deal is worth the potential minimal hassle."
PS4Deals,2zih1t,thestatic1982,1 point,Thu Mar 19 15:13:45 2015 UTC,How long did it take you to get a working code?  I have e-mailed them and haven't received a response back yet.  It's been less than 24 hours but longer than I'd care to wait.  I'm somewhat impatient and hoping to get this downloaded in time that I can actually play this evening.
PS4Deals,2zih1t,bigbeardbeatdwn,2,Mon Apr 6 17:57:21 2015 UTC,"It took them about five days, but I initially contacted them on a Friday evening. They sent me a replacement code that following Wednesday if I'm not mistaken"
PS4Deals,2zih1t,thestatic1982,1 point,Mon Apr 6 18:55:51 2015 UTC,Wow.  I'm going to be super pissed if it takes that long.  Edit: They corrected this for me in less than 24 hours and it wasn't their fault actually.  I tried activating the code directly under code redemption.  Yo Dawg!  I had to activate my code so I could get another code to activate.

As a Best Buy GCU member I appreciate you posting this info as I prefer to get my games at Best Buy and don't always know when they have sales.  I usually wait for some games get really cheap and then I purchase with my GCU discount for even cheaper.  Good deal.
PS4Deals,2zi819,digitalgoodtime,2,Thu Mar 19 16:22:13 2015 UTC,So with the gcu do we really only get 3 games discounted for PS4 per year?
PS4Deals,2zi819,logicalspeculation,3,Thu Mar 19 19:52:55 2015 UTC,"No, it's unlimited different games. That rule is saying you can't buy more than three copies of each title, and that's per console. So you can buy three copies of Bloodborne per year with your 20% off, not four."

PS4Deals,2ze2gs,macfamm,2,Wed Mar 18 05:21:00 2015 UTC,I think it is. There are frame rate drops every once and a while but nothing I would call extreme. I thought the game was excellent and definitely worth picking up for $35.
PS4Deals,2zdwn5,jtl012,3,Tue Mar 17 19:47:39 2015 UTC,Boo.  I was just about to buy the previous bundle.
PS4Deals,2zdwn5,ActionFlank,2,Tue Mar 17 20:19:16 2015 UTC,Same here. I had just gotten the last of my 400$ together from selling off some old games on Amazon and was going to add it to my cart. Son of a BITCH.
PS4Deals,2zdwn5,wolfzr2,2,Wed Mar 18 00:10:52 2015 UTC,So I'm looking into getting a PS4 to replace my 360. Is this a good deal? Haven't really looked into bundles for them.
PS4Deals,2zdwn5,slenderonsundayONLY,2,Wed Mar 18 17:52:30 2015 UTC,"Battlefield Hardline just came out yesterday, I'd give it a day or two for some in depth reviews of it to go up online, But technically speaking your getting the console, everything inside the box, One of the best games of the decade in The Last of US. and a brand new game in Hardline. Thats like a $500 value for $435. And plus in mine at least, it came with a free $10 psn code."
PS4Deals,2zdwn5,slenderonsundayONLY,1 point,Wed Mar 18 18:10:03 2015 UTC,Do you think it would be better than buying something off of Craigslist?
PS4Deals,2zdwn5,Megawhatt24,1 point,Wed Mar 18 18:13:03 2015 UTC,"100%, with Amazon you get the peace of mind that if something happens with it and it malfunctions you get the year long manufacturers warranty, and you have to opportunity to extend it 3 years PLUS accidental damage for like $60. Way better idea than buying from a random person on craigslist."
PS4Deals,2zdwn5,Arturistic,1 point,Wed Mar 18 22:19:30 2015 UTC,Any chance Gamestop would match this?  I'm looking to trade in my PS3 there soon for the $175 towards a PS4.
PS4Deals,2zdwn5,wobel85,3,Wed Mar 18 17:24:40 2015 UTC,Gamestop doesn't price match.

PS4Deals,2zd26y,BrendanBeckmann,1 point,Thu Mar 19 22:10:17 2015 UTC,"I got my order. Controller works just fine. The packaging was dinged up, which is probably the cause for the markdown IMO but there is absolutely nothing wring with the controller that I'm aware of."

PS4Deals,2z9cp3,Golden_Taint,6,Mon Mar 16 18:36:26 2015 UTC,That is extremely decent.  Is ebgames in Canada doing this? I can't find any similar deal....
PS4Deals,2z9cp3,Nawara_Ven,0,Mon Mar 16 18:51:59 2015 UTC,"I just got my PS4 last week. Shoppers Drug Mart has been my source for my Wii, 3DS, xbox360, and PS4.   At 95,000 points, you get $170 off. I ended up getting my PS4 for $340 or so tax included.   If you only shop on 20x points days/18,500 points for $75 days, it'll take you approximately $500 (since 20x $500 gives you around 100k points). You get around the equivalent of 34% to 40% cash back depending on the promo.  Better than best buy's horrible points system.   Edit: it's 18,500 sorry."
PS4Deals,2z9cp3,rinwashere,1 point,Tue Mar 17 01:18:58 2015 UTC,"I would not have thought of that at all ever. Thanks for the great tip!  I see in the flier for this week it's ""20x points on cosmetics"". So what you're saying is that sometimes there are 20x points on everything/electronics, and that buying the PS4 or whatever is reaching a purchasing target?  Or are you saying that just from ""normal"" shopping on the high points-vale days, you fairly easily accumulated sufficient points for a 34+% discount?"
PS4Deals,2z9cp3,Nawara_Ven,2,Tue Mar 17 02:00:20 2015 UTC,"There are two main events you should be on the look out for. 20x points on everything and 18,500 points for $75+. Usually the combination of the two gets me the points i need.   I would recommend buying whatever stuff and saving the points for your console purchases... usually on 20x points days bargain hunters go out and buy the expensive stuff hoping to flip it. I also have to warn you that SDM stocks electronics sparodically. I've been looking for that PS4 on and off since last Sept or so. Tons of xbones though. I drove two townships away to find my 3DSXL.   The 34% isn't a discount per se, it's more of a cash back. For example, I had $170 cashback for the $169.99 3DSXL, but they calculate the tax on the $169.99 ... so it's more like a gift certificate than a discount."
PS4Deals,2z9cp3,rinwashere,1 point,Tue Mar 17 02:23:27 2015 UTC,I understand. This is quite helpful! Thanks again.
PS4Deals,2z9cp3,Nawara_Ven,13,Tue Mar 17 02:45:18 2015 UTC,Very tempting but I am pretty set on holding onto my ps3.
PS4Deals,2z9cp3,dilligiff,3,Mon Mar 16 19:06:28 2015 UTC,"FYI - I called two of my local GSs, and one of them decided to work with me (the other played dumb and treated me like a moron). The one that decided to work with me allowed me to purchase the PS4, get the membership for the year of PS+, then return that PS4 for ALL store credit. I was out to get a Vita anyway, so I used the credit to buy that, which left me with a $212 gift card. I would have actually been fine with keeping this for random purchases, but my buddy ended up doing the deal to actually upgrade to PS4, so I sold it to him.   What a great deal though! I have at least three friends that made the upgrade over the last few days. Don't miss out!"
PS4Deals,2z9cp3,BuffyArlington,2,Thu Mar 19 15:03:01 2015 UTC,Where'd you get the expiration date? I haven't seen that anywhere else.
PS4Deals,2z9cp3,thom_weights,4,Mon Mar 16 18:59:51 2015 UTC,"Called my local store and asked, they confirmed April 5th."
PS4Deals,2z9cp3,thom_weights,1 point,Mon Mar 16 19:14:03 2015 UTC,Thanks! That might be enough time to try and find something cheap/worth it off CowBoom or eBay since my PS3 doesn't meet the requirements...
PS4Deals,2z9cp3,Joniak,1 point,Mon Mar 16 19:21:39 2015 UTC,The cowboom deal of the day is a 250GB Xbox 360 for $85.  http://www.cowboom.com/deal-of-the-day.cfm  So you're still be saving $90.
PS4Deals,2z9cp3,thom_weights,1 point,Mon Mar 16 20:13:36 2015 UTC,"I saw that but it says:  Not Included: Xbox 360 Controller, A/v Cable, Owners Manual  Would you still get the full $175 from GameStop, or would they charge you for not having a controller & component cables?"
PS4Deals,2z9cp3,kevinbstout,2,Mon Mar 16 20:20:20 2015 UTC,Just did this deal when it was $125 and my controller was broken. They told me I could buy their cheapest used controller (it was $15 I think) and they took that off the credit.
PS4Deals,2z9cp3,thom_weights,1 point,Mon Mar 16 20:34:15 2015 UTC,"Someone correct me if i'm wrong, but this deal might make more sense? Comes with a controller and most of the components, plus free shipping and $5 off if you use code 'CowBoom5'  http://www.cowboom.com/product/1297239?utm_source=rvs&utm_medium=afl&utm_campaign=1312731"
PS4Deals,2z9cp3,kevinbstout,1 point,Mon Mar 16 20:44:54 2015 UTC,I saw that one. But how do you buy it? I click best available and nothing loads.
PS4Deals,2z9cp3,Allister24,2,Mon Mar 16 20:47:29 2015 UTC,Is this on top of the value they give you for the old system?
PS4Deals,2z9cp3,TheEternal21,3,Mon Mar 16 19:57:26 2015 UTC,"No, this is the value. But $175 for a last-gen system is much better than what's usually offered by dealers."
PS4Deals,2z9cp3,BuffyArlington,1 point,Mon Mar 16 20:08:06 2015 UTC,"I just traded in my 2nd PS3 for another PS4.  Got $175, and the guy said, normally they only pay about $50."
PS4Deals,2z9cp3,Strange_Bot08,2,Wed Mar 18 18:30:19 2015 UTC,Is it too much a dick move for me to do this and immediately return the PS4 and buy a Vita?
PS4Deals,2z9cp3,BuffyArlington,1 point,Mon Mar 16 19:21:20 2015 UTC,"A bit, but totally kosher lol. Just say it's for a gift, then say they already had one but now you want to get them a Vita. At least you'll be putting it towards something and not just getting it all back. Don't let them know it's the plan all along lol.  Edit: Make sure to leave it sealed."
PS4Deals,2z9cp3,Strange_Bot08,2,Mon Mar 16 20:48:05 2015 UTC,I was thinking of buying it and then returning it at a different store this weekend. That might cushion the blow.
PS4Deals,2z9cp3,Toasteee,2,Mon Mar 16 20:51:47 2015 UTC,"There's really not much they could do anyways, not really breaking policy. Good luck!"
PS4Deals,2z9cp3,BuffyArlington,-2,Mon Mar 16 20:55:21 2015 UTC,"You're not really gaining anything out of it though, are you? I'm kind of confused on what you're trying to do. I'm seeing it as you giving the console for free and paying the $225+ for the PS4 and returning it just to get the $225+ back?"
PS4Deals,2z9cp3,Toasteee,3,Mon Mar 16 22:03:40 2015 UTC,You would also get the $175 credit from your console back. I am essentially doing this for the $175 credit. The return is so I can use that to purchase a Vita. Almost a clean swap.
PS4Deals,2z9cp3,Toasteee,1 point,Mon Mar 16 22:40:21 2015 UTC,"Oh well,thanks for clearing this up! I think i might try it myself also since I already have a PS4 and have an xbox 360 lying around."
PS4Deals,2z9cp3,BuffyArlington,1 point,Mon Mar 16 23:14:32 2015 UTC,Sorry for asking questions. But the credit would be given back as in store credit correct? And that can be used afterwards for anything else other than towards the PS4?
PS4Deals,2z9cp3,cstater,1 point,Mon Mar 16 23:17:20 2015 UTC,That is correct. I'll be using it for my Vita :)
PS4Deals,2z9cp3,novapunkX,1 point,Mon Mar 16 23:31:36 2015 UTC,ToI bad they don't do this for an old 20gb 360... Lol.  I wonder if they would offer anything for it?
PS4Deals,2z9cp3,kalu0y,1 point,Mon Mar 16 23:32:57 2015 UTC,Buy a 250GB drive and pop it in ;)
PS4Deals,2z9cp3,novapunkX,1 point,Tue Mar 17 13:08:22 2015 UTC,Anyone tried this? I actually bought a 250GB hard drive for my 4GB 360. Wonder if I can trade that in for a $175 credit.
PS4Deals,2z9cp3,kalu0y,2,Thu Mar 19 04:43:10 2015 UTC,I did a deal like this through gamestop over a year ago. My xbox wasn't an original 250 but they counted it when I traded it in. They just check the HD size via settings.

PS4Deals,2z9cp3,calebisstupid,1 point,Thu Mar 19 14:34:25 2015 UTC,I think it's $50 store credit for anything under 120gig I think.
PS4Deals,2z9cp3,Tulkus,1 point,Thu Mar 19 21:39:44 2015 UTC,Just traded mine last week...there's no way for me to get that credit now right?

PS4Deals,2z9cp3,Megawhatt24,1 point,Tue Mar 17 05:38:32 2015 UTC,Not sure if this has been mentioned but the trade-in is not limited to one system. You can trade in both an Xbox 360 and a PS3 and get $350 in credit towards the PS4. I verified this works today.
PS4Deals,2z9cp3,wobel85,1 point,Thu Mar 19 01:22:15 2015 UTC,Can I just trade it in for cash towards ps4 games?
PS4Deals,2z9cp3,WeTheNorthRTZ,1 point,Thu Mar 19 05:41:04 2015 UTC,The $175 offer is only if you're buying a PS4 console. Otherwise it's like $50-100.

PS4Deals,2z9cp3,TheRealCestus,1 point,Thu Mar 19 21:38:30 2015 UTC,Is the last of us a disc copy or a digital code?  I already own the game so would need to sell it.  I wonder if any other bundles will be coming out before this promotion is over.
PS4Deals,2z9cp3,facehumpjerk,1 point,Fri Mar 20 16:35:38 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it's a code.

PS4Deals,2z8jgt,Johnny_Guano,2,Tue Mar 17 00:18:53 2015 UTC,No you're fine - sad to say. Some States charge tax (also depends on whether store has physical stores in the state) - I know mine does.   I couldn't get mine to work even (unavailable at this time)- but it's either cuz of a VPN or since it's debit I suspect.

PS4Deals,2z5os3,RavenTaco,2,Sun Mar 15 20:31:03 2015 UTC,Will Best Buy price match this?
PS4Deals,2z5os3,Spontaneousamnesia,1 point,Mon Mar 16 14:07:52 2015 UTC,Lol just got the bundle with the headset at target. Damn
PS4Deals,2z5os3,pr0adam,1 point,Sun Mar 15 21:34:17 2015 UTC,Any word on when this is scheduled to end?
PS4Deals,2z5os3,Inspect0r7,2,Thu Mar 19 02:28:08 2015 UTC,Today apparently. Damn. Wish I would have pulled the trigger on this.
PS4Deals,2z5os3,bestfriendz,1 point,Sat Mar 21 13:33:12 2015 UTC,"No idea. It went out of stock yesterday, but now its back on... So I guess get it while its hot."
PS4Deals,2z5os3,splendasthetits,-1,Sat Mar 21 18:48:00 2015 UTC,Whats the point of getting the console with an extra controller when the Last of Us is only 1 player?
PS4Deals,2z5os3,pr0adam,2,Mon Mar 16 13:25:19 2015 UTC,I had all the ps+ games saved up and quite a few of them are Co op. So anyone else in that situation would definitely find that extra controller useful
PS4Deals,2z5os3,Spontaneousamnesia,1 point,Mon Mar 16 15:22:15 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard, the battery life sucks on the controllers so you could switch them out while playing (or if you forget to charge one) and there's a few multiplayer games available now."
PS4Deals,2z5os3,splendasthetits,-1,Mon Mar 16 15:09:53 2015 UTC,Just thought it was funny how there is no immediate use in this package for the second controller.  Only reason of having it is the extended battery life.
PS4Deals,2z5os3,Spontaneousamnesia,0,Mon Mar 16 15:17:57 2015 UTC,Yeah it is pretty useless at first but eventually it might come in handy. Considering going to best buy and picking this up if they price match.

PS4Deals,2z5r3r,Golden_Taint,4,Sun Mar 15 20:49:49 2015 UTC,So happy I waited it out and snagged Destiny for less than half price.  Yeah buddy!!
PS4Deals,2z5r3r,dlkilla77,2,Sun Mar 15 22:51:06 2015 UTC,You did get the product and it wasn't a scam. Just can't seem to believe that it is $28.
PS4Deals,2z5r3r,OutlawFMA,6,Sun Mar 15 23:41:16 2015 UTC,"Boxed Deal was featured a lot on this sub during the holidays, they are legit. I've seen occasional issues with the codes taking longer than expected to send out, but that's about it."
PS4Deals,2z5r3r,dlkilla77,2,Mon Mar 16 03:33:30 2015 UTC,Yeah I got destiny.  I had done this pick one of four game before for tlou.  No problems with either.
PS4Deals,2z5r3r,khanjal,5,Mon Mar 16 00:08:09 2015 UTC,Confirming that this is legit. I now have Destiny. Thanks!
PS4Deals,2z5r3r,le_drakkar,2,Mon Mar 16 03:20:34 2015 UTC,Would it work as a European if I buy it on my US account and swap to play it on my EU account (the one that has PS+) ? It worked for another game but it didn't require PS+.
PS4Deals,2z5r3r,swotam,1 point,Sun Mar 15 21:39:34 2015 UTC,"If your EU & US accounts are set as Primary on the PS4 then the EU PS+ membership should apply to all accounts on the system and all accounts should be able to play Destiny. At least, that's been my experience."
PS4Deals,2z5r3r,szlachta,1 point,Mon Mar 16 14:56:28 2015 UTC,"I got TLOU from here for $16. Everything worked well, and although I had to make use of the site's support, they kind man on the other end took care of my problem in less than 20 seconds."
PS4Deals,2z5r3r,verikosto,1 point,Mon Mar 16 12:45:37 2015 UTC,is this worth the money if i just play it alone?
PS4Deals,2z5r3r,swotam,3,Mon Mar 16 14:45:05 2015 UTC,"I play solo since I'm older and my friends don't game. You'll be fine, all the story missions you can run solo, the strikes and weekly heroic missions will matchmake teams for you automatically. Only content that really requires other players that the game doesn't provide are the raids and the weekly Nightfall event. For those, most of us just use /r/fireteams to find people quickly, it's an awesome resource."
PS4Deals,2z5r3r,oddburrito,1 point,Mon Mar 16 16:09:13 2015 UTC,"You can play alone as much as you want, the only activities that require matchmaking (teams) are The Crucible (PVP), Strikes, and Raids. However, you can get pretty much to max level without doing these activities if you wish. The only problem is, it gets boring after a while because you're doing the same stuff over and over by yourself."
PS4Deals,2z5r3r,dehli,1 point,Mon Mar 16 14:54:39 2015 UTC,"At this price it's not so bad, but imo, you're better off spending your money on something else"

PS4Deals,2yww2p,swotam,2,Fri Mar 13 14:36:59 2015 UTC,Just got it from ebgames for same price.

PS4Deals,2yww2p,redder23,1 point,Fri Mar 13 15:46:00 2015 UTC,I've heard bad to decent things about this game...but for $20 I think I'll go for it as i am a fan  of open world games.
PS4Deals,2yww2p,SCam36,2,Fri Mar 13 15:49:00 2015 UTC,"It's not that bad, I picked it up last Spring when it came out and it was alright. Not awesome, but not terrible either. For $20 you'll get a lot of gameplay, that's for sure."
PS4Deals,2yww2p,Onionsteak,1 point,Fri Mar 13 15:56:08 2015 UTC,"I picked it up at launch, but traded it in after getting bored of it. But for $20, I'm going to buy it again and try to finish it."
PS4Deals,2yww2p,JeNeSaisPasDeux,1 point,Fri Mar 13 17:31:46 2015 UTC,$20 is awesome price for this game. Even 40 is IMO
PS4Deals,2yww2p,JeNeSaisPasDeux,1 point,Sat Mar 14 16:46:05 2015 UTC,"Glitches and issues aside, how decent is this game's storyline and gameplay?"
PS4Deals,2yww2p,Emerican09,1 point,Fri Mar 13 16:06:26 2015 UTC,"The story is OK and the gameplay is interesting if not somewhat repetitive as time goes by. I'd say the closest thing to compare it to would be GTA with a revenge/justice theme and hacking elements as a key part of missions. While it's not close to GTA quality-wise, it's still an generally enjoyable game. For $20 you can't really go wrong."
PS4Deals,2ywzm5,swotam,1 point,Fri Mar 13 15:06:06 2015 UTC,"If you haven't already jumped on this particular bandwagon, it's a decent price. Available online and for in-store pickup."

PS4Deals,2yw1y4,swotam,-4,Tue Mar 17 17:54:20 2015 UTC,Not worth 30 unless you rent it first. Im sure Ill get downvoted but this game is not for everyone.
PS4Deals,2yw1y4,bane9907,2,Fri Mar 13 15:47:03 2015 UTC,"Why do you say that? I haven't played it and don't really plan to, but I wanted the game when I first heard about it"
PS4Deals,2yw1y4,IronGoht,3,Fri Mar 13 16:53:03 2015 UTC,"The sub is about deal. So, I posted a deal. Each to their own if it's for them or not. I'm sure they can watch YouTube or check out Metacritic.  Personally I like the game and the atmosphere is creepy. As for being terrifying, it's not. It's more of a Resident Evil than it is an Alien Isolation or Outlast. But, nonetheless, I like it."
PS4Deals,2yw1y4,bane9907,-2,Fri Mar 13 20:23:49 2015 UTC,i never said its not ok to like it. just offering some additional info that i think is relevant. so dont worry about it unless you stand to lose a profit from the sale.

PS4Deals,2yo7cx,zambezy,14,Wed Mar 11 12:44:09 2015 UTC,I predict they will drop the base value by 30-50% as well!

PS4Deals,2yo7cx,UncleDrew44,2,Thu Mar 12 01:31:05 2015 UTC,I know GTA V was $35 before the last 30% bonus and the week of it went to 30%. So it's still a slightly better deal.
PS4Deals,2yo7cx,cats05,2,Wed Mar 11 18:30:04 2015 UTC,Far Cry 4 on Friday was $25.  Today... $20.

PS4Deals,2yo7cx,illadope,1 point,Tue Mar 17 18:18:54 2015 UTC,"You can't share them with him/her unless you share the same online log-in. You buy the GCU membership and it gets applied to your My Best Buy account. Everytime you buy online with that account you will get the discount. When you buy in store you have to have them apply it to your rewards account (which you should be doing anyway) and you will get the discount. In-store would be impossible to share with your friend, but you can buy up to 3 of the same version of a game (for instance, 3 copies of GTA V for PS4) and your friend can just pay you back.  If that's too much hassle, you and your friend should still both just get individual memberships. $30 isn't steep and pays for itself very quickly."
PS4Deals,2yo7cx,Kukimawnstar,1 point,Tue Mar 17 18:24:50 2015 UTC,"Awesome. Thank you for the quick and in-depth reply! I rarely buy from BB, so creating a a shared account wouldn't be an issue; and it never dawned on me to just buy the games and have him pay me back.. hahah. Thanks again."

That's what I'll probably be doing if this deal is still going in a week."

I enjoyed that it was challenging and the creatures are cool (enemies and bosses). I didn't enjoy parts of the game where if you didn't do exactly what they wanted, you died. It just didn't seemed fair. For example, there was a part where you had to run from a boss, and there was another part where you had to fight the boss, and it wasn't clear what you were supposed to do."

PS4Deals,2ycll2,kisorcerer,3,Sun Mar 8 17:02:32 2015 UTC,"Not sure if it would work, but you could try price matching the price of some of these games down and then applying the 30% discount on top of it. I'm guessing it's YMMV though...  Edit: to add, you only have to spend $1 to reserve the game you choose."
PS4Deals,2ycll2,DreadMcLaren,1 point,Sun Mar 8 19:17:49 2015 UTC,Didnt work when i tried a few days ago. Preordered Bloodborne but had to choose between pricematch or 30% off. The pricematch with amazon  is cheaper for DA and AW tho so kind of pointless

PS4Deals,2ycll2,kwirl,1 point,Fri Mar 13 13:17:49 2015 UTC,Not to sure it's gonna happen. A lot of the stores discontinued the game as soon as they received it. It's really upsetting because a lot of people want it for 30% and we won't ever get it again.
PS4Deals,2ycll2,Haunter20X,0,Sat Mar 14 14:27:21 2015 UTC,"You have to pricematch first, then add the game reserve for a dollar then the game. The register should automatically register the %30 off, if not bring up the promo. It also depends on who u are dealing with and the time of day. I do most pricematch and deals late at night like an hour before closing because the staff thuns out and you can identify an easy mark by their demeanour. Went to Best Buy two nights ago and picked up an Xbox 360 controller for Windows and wanted it to have it price matched with Newegg. 1 price match option was $33 the other price match option was $28 but not sold directly by Newegg. I asked the lady at the register if they price match Newegg and when she replied she never heard of it, I showed her the listing for $28 from my mobile phone because I knew she wouldn't know what to look for. The price at the store was $41.99, you just have to know how to read people."
PS4Deals,2ycll2,GoldenCyn,4,Sat Mar 14 03:21:58 2015 UTC,"I got confused with the reserve part of the title. It's really having to ""pre-order"" a game at Target and then choose one of the current games to get the 30% off for the current game you're buying."
PS4Deals,2ycll2,Toasteee,4,Sun Mar 8 18:58:02 2015 UTC,pre order a game for 1 dollars and get 30 percent off selected titles

PS4Deals,2ycll2,heyenikin,1 point,Sat Mar 14 03:40:35 2015 UTC,"For whatever reason, Target had Evil Within at $30 online and $60 in-store. Got them to price match their online store and pre-ordered Dead Island 2 for $1 to get the 30% off. Had two gift cards equaling $20, so I ended up getting Evil Within for $3.50 after the 5% off with the Red Card. It was pretty sweet."

PS4Deals,2y9v4l,dfrazier81,0,Mon Mar 9 04:32:47 2015 UTC,Disagree about the controls. Sure a little annoying at first but very easy to learn once you use them for a little while. I platinum'd the game no problem.

PS4Deals,2y4zz2,theo198,1 point,Fri Mar 6 14:44:47 2015 UTC,For anyone interested this game is $29.99 USD (Downloaded) Website deal works in Canada.
PS4Deals,2y4zz2,WilliamDecker,-1,Sat Mar 7 07:33:59 2015 UTC,The weak Canadian dollar makes that a dead deal.
PS4Deals,2y4zz2,theo198,3,Tue Mar 10 16:11:12 2015 UTC,"When converted it comes out to around $38, so technically it's cheaper by a couple of bucks plus tax saved. All told you'd pay around $7 less if you bought the digital copy from the US, but otherwise $40 is a pretty good deal for a physical copy of a really fun game."
PS4Deals,2y4zz2,WilliamDecker,1 point,Tue Mar 10 18:04:26 2015 UTC,There's no tax on $29.99 USD = $38.09 while in store it's $39.99 + tax = $45.19. Both are a good price but the digital version is still a good deal. Some people also prefer the digital download over the disk as well.
PS4Deals,2y4zz2,theo198,1 point,Wed Mar 11 04:29:02 2015 UTC,"Most Canadian ISP's have data caps, and download is a bit much.  Also the physical copy has resale value."
PS4Deals,2y4zz2,WilliamDecker,1 point,Wed Mar 11 05:15:48 2015 UTC,If you're with a wired provider Canada which has small caps it's your own fault. Rogers top plans now have no caps at all and for slower plans Teksavvy has a 400 gb cap with unlimited night time usage. I don't resell my games so that's not something I consider important. Not having to look for games or transporting just the console without cases is much more important to me.
PS4Deals,2y4zz2,theo198,1 point,Wed Mar 11 05:35:02 2015 UTC,I have 300GB with Teksavvy.  Gaming isn't the only thing my bandwidth is used for.  How do I schedule my PS4 to only download during offpeak?  Also...I trade games with friends.  Difficult to do with digital copies.
PS4Deals,2y4zz2,stripeymonkey,1 point,Wed Mar 11 05:39:06 2015 UTC,I think most of Teksavvy's 300gb plans actually got upgraded to 400 gb not long ago. I completely understand. I'm also on  one of Teksavvy's 400gb plan. I'm not sure if the ps4 can. I'm often enough awake at  2 am which is when off peak starts so I just start the download then.   Digital copies aren't for everyone. If you prefer to be able to trade games then you may as well go for the disk.

PS4Deals,2y14bv,gorte1ec,1 point,Thu Mar 5 21:53:58 2015 UTC,This is a really gread headset for quality sound and chat features. However they are cheaply made. i had mine for about 6 months and then the headband cracked and the mic stopped working.
PS4Deals,2y14bv,AtomicMenace,1 point,Thu Mar 5 20:50:13 2015 UTC,My headband also cracked on mine.  Now I'm sporting PX22's and I have to say the quality of the mic along with the amp that it comes with is much better in terms of overall value and quality.

Stay far away from turtle beach,skull candy is also great just a pain in the ass to hook up."
PS4Deals,2y14bv,Strike48,2,Fri Mar 13 17:33:39 2015 UTC,I owned a pair before getting astros. The headset itself is really solid for the price. Good sounds and all. The only thing that I didnt like was the size of the earcups. The top of my ear would stay out of the full inside cup and it starts aching after a while. So if your ears are someone decently sized then I wouldnt recommend it.
PS4Deals,2y14bv,applesforadam,1 point,Fri Mar 13 02:04:23 2015 UTC,I can't think of anything else near the price that comes close.

PS4Deals,2y14bv,ProbablyHighAsShit,1 point,Thu Mar 12 22:11:03 2015 UTC,Its excellent. Mic is embedded and doesn't have any feedback. Headphones are 7.1 Virtual Surround and you can mix between chat or gameplay sound preference. $75 is a great deal for these.
PS4Deals,2y14bv,Virhostis,0,Wed Mar 18 01:07:20 2015 UTC,Go for it if you need a headset. They probably aren't the best out there but they are pretty amazing for $75. I've read in some reviews that people need to connect the headset to their controller to use the chat feature but I have not had a problem using it wirelessly.
PS4Deals,2y14bv,ScelesticPanda,0,Thu Mar 5 19:42:02 2015 UTC,"They're damned good and don't require the hassle of third party headsets.  Plug in the USB dongle, turn them on and go.  Sound quality is okay, I'd say like 6.5 or 7/10, mic is great.  The ability to mix chat and game audio on the headset itself is awesome as well.  If these are within your price range, grab 'em, you won't regret it."
PS4Deals,2y14bv,cornmonkey,2,Fri Mar 6 03:12:45 2015 UTC,Does anyone know if this is the lowest it'll go for now? Or might there be other retailers selling it for a lower price?
PS4Deals,2y14bv,ScelesticPanda,4,Thu Mar 5 19:08:56 2015 UTC,"A while back, Newegg had a deal going on with Google Wallet that essentially brought the Gold Headphones down to ~$45. I bought a couple when that sale was happening, sold one and kept the other. Having said this, I highly doubt these will go on sale for that price again outside of possible BlackFriday deals. Nowadays, I would consider $70-75 a good deal."

PS4Deals,2y14bv,BehavioralSink,1 point,Thu Mar 5 20:53:32 2015 UTC,"The generally work well, although I do find that mine occasionally cut out on my PS4 and the light on the dongle starts blinking while they sync up again. They use Wi-Fi to connect to the console IIRC, not Bluetooth, so if you are in an area with a lot of Wi-Fi networks broadcasting themselves you might have some interference issues from time to time. At least, that's what I suspect...  They're very comfortable and sound good. Friends say the voice chat quality is good (when it's not cutting out that is...). Can't complain overall, just not sure why they cut out at times."
PS4Deals,2y14bv,empossible,1 point,Fri Mar 6 16:47:45 2015 UTC,"Perhaps a stupid question, but is there any particular reason why you would want these when you can just plug in any set of headphones/headphones with microphone directly into the controller?"
PS4Deals,2y14bv,BehavioralSink,2,Sat Mar 7 22:24:30 2015 UTC,"Wireless for one.; even though its a short cord, it still bothers me (obviously a person opinion).  They are virtual 7.1 surround sound; most headphones/headsets will just be stereo.  There is also an app you can download from the PS Store for the headset.  The app allows you to program different audio profiles to the headset.  They have generic ones for shooters, action, etc, but some games have their own custom profiles designed by the developers."

If you plan to swap these between PC and Playstation often, as I do, then that might be an issue for you. I love them, however."
PS4Deals,2y14f1,BuffyArlington,4,Thu Mar 5 15:52:36 2015 UTC,Be aware their system doesn't appear to be automated so you won't get your code right away. I ordered mine about an hour ago and no confirmation of receipt or code yet. I've sent support an email and am now waiting for a reply.  Or their system is automated and is just terrible  EDIT: Got the code roughly 2 hours later

PS4Deals,2y14f1,rgxa2,1 point,Thu Mar 19 17:07:28 2015 UTC,Go onto the PSN store on your ps4 and scroll down to Redeem code and type the code in then afterwards you can go queue it with your downloads

PS4Deals,2y14f1,ShadowStrikerPL,1 point,Thu Mar 5 20:00:58 2015 UTC,"I think these guys are reselling codes from bundled PS4 units or something like that, there's no way they could sell it for so little otherwise. The same goes for the other games they have, all the titles are in some way related to a Sony promotion, either bundled in the box or as part of the pick one of 4 promo.  Either way, it's cheap and the codes are good."

I purchased this myself and got the code within 2-3 minutes after completing the transaction on PayPal. Even with the exchange rate difference it comes out to around $20 CAD which is pretty good for an excellent game."

I know you get what you pay for, get the Sony Gold headset for ten dollars more (at this current time)   Also, if you leave an actual review which I did you have some Chinese lady phoning your phone asking you to take down the factual indication of your experience. ""The headset didn't work but they were nice enough to deal with and respond back to and provide me with a refund"" and you can see the review here!  It's very annoying and I suggest taking your business elsewhere. Unless you want someone from china calling you at 11:00 PM when you're in bed because you have an early morning the next day saying ""you (amazonusername) you upset, you take down review, we provided you with a refund, we see no problem"""

It's Best Buy's paid membership program, best one of it's kind available. 20% off of all new games is the big perk, you also get 10% off of used games and 10% extra trade in credit. Membership is usually $100 for 2 years (worth it but a lot to spend up front), but they routinely do deals on it. Anywhere from $30, down to $10 depending on the promotion. For example, I scored mine for free for buying a $15 phone.  GCU membership deals get posted here whenever they pop up, subscribe if you haven't already and you'll see it next time around."

PS4Deals,2xjrld,sweet_chin_muzak,1 point,Mon Mar 2 17:37:58 2015 UTC,"Lol, yeah you're playing it in an odd fashion. FYI, most if the game doesn't even unlock until you ""beat"" it and clear through Act V."

PS4Deals,2xjrld,Johnny_Guano,2,Mon Mar 2 18:14:22 2015 UTC,I know this is a week old but just to give you an answer you are playing really conservatively.   Look at the story mode and leveling from 1-70 as a tutorial. That's essentially what it ends up being. Gear under level 70 does not matter. Just go by the green and red arrows to see if it is better or worse. In story mode all you really want is gear that will keep you alive yet put out enough damage to roll through it quickly. At 60 hours in you should have beaten story and been through adventure enough to unlock rifts and greater rifts.   The game really begins at 70 since now your gear choice does matter. You want your build to work with all your gear. Now you will be less worried about the green and red arrows and start looking for gear that works together. Look up good build strategies for your class. They all require level 70 and certain gear and skills.   TLDR: Enjoy story mode for what it is. Just complete as fast as you wish but do not stress too much for any gear under level 70. Just try different pieces and different play styles. This will help you narrow down what end game build you want to go for.

PS4Deals,2x9cba,hero2goat,1 point,Thu Feb 26 21:49:41 2015 UTC,Same here. Worked like a charm.
PS4Deals,2x9cba,Aero_Z,2,Sat Feb 28 21:40:20 2015 UTC,Chat support told me it's some mismatch with your delivery/billing/Paypal adress it must be the same. They make an exception in chat if you keep having problems
PS4Deals,2x9cba,warshooter,2,Fri Feb 27 09:14:58 2015 UTC,"Perhaps it's because I am travelling outside the US at the moment and the IP is foreign?  The Paypal addy and one in boxed deal are identical, but it doesn't matter now. It's OOS. Thank you for your reply."
PS4Deals,2x9cba,szlachta,2,Fri Feb 27 14:20:53 2015 UTC,Hmm ... this will go well with the $349 deal w/o TLOU. Anybody know can you use Newegg codes on that deal below?
PS4Deals,2x9cba,Johnny_Guano,2,Thu Feb 26 21:58:04 2015 UTC,Out of stock. I missed it again.

PS4Deals,2x9cba,verikosto,1 point,Sat Feb 28 18:05:33 2015 UTC,Same thing happened to me...
PS4Deals,2x9cba,WilliamDecker,1 point,Sat Feb 28 18:21:45 2015 UTC,"Happened to me too. I sent a email through their support form and wasn't expecting a reply until Monday but just got one about an hour ago. They sent a new code and it worked just fine.  I probably won't go out of my way to buy from them again, but I've wanted to play this for a while and missed all the holiday deals last year so it was worth the risk to me."
PS4Deals,2x9cba,clage,1 point,Sun Mar 1 20:52:29 2015 UTC,Same.  Looks like Steve in customer service is working today!

PS4Deals,2x76ae,Vecuronium,2,Thu Feb 26 07:24:50 2015 UTC,So I ended up getting this! So excited.  I'm a PC guy and use sites like cheapshark.com and isthereanydeal. What are the sites for finding the PS4 game deals? Anybody?
PS4Deals,2x76ae,Johnny_Guano,2,Thu Feb 26 23:20:50 2015 UTC,Slick deals and cheap ass gamer.

PS4Deals,2x76ae,DreadMcLaren,1 point,Thu Feb 26 23:27:48 2015 UTC,any idea how long this will last? and is this a reputable seller?
PS4Deals,2x76ae,dalive,1 point,Thu Feb 26 05:41:54 2015 UTC,It is a reputable seller.
PS4Deals,2x76ae,DreadMcLaren,1 point,Thu Feb 26 17:31:28 2015 UTC,Does this come with a controller?
PS4Deals,2x76ae,bonzo21xx,3,Thu Feb 26 06:19:21 2015 UTC,Yes.
PS4Deals,2x76ae,DreadMcLaren,1 point,Thu Feb 26 17:31:34 2015 UTC,Can I assume that on any deal like this that comes along that I would not be the owner of the mfg warrantee? Buying from an eBay seller would make me nervous that I would have the bad luck of getting a lemon with no recourse.
PS4Deals,2x76ae,JoeyVee1882,2,Thu Feb 26 11:04:53 2015 UTC,"It still comes with the Manufacturer Warranty. You also have 30 days to return it, if it's unopened."
PS4Deals,2x76ae,DreadMcLaren,1 point,Thu Feb 26 17:32:41 2015 UTC,This is what I'm doing if some one can confirm the deal
PS4Deals,2x76ae,BlLLr0y,1 point,Thu Feb 26 14:55:07 2015 UTC,Mine shipped out this morning.
PS4Deals,2x76ae,DreadMcLaren,1 point,Thu Feb 26 17:33:00 2015 UTC,How do you select the game? I'm assuming its a digital download and there is a code in the box?
PS4Deals,2x76ae,conker18,2,Thu Feb 26 15:08:44 2015 UTC,Voucher inside the box. Go here to redeem your game once you receive the voucher:  http://www.playstation.com/en-us/inside-playstation/events/2014/ps4-4games1pick/
PS4Deals,2x76ae,DreadMcLaren,1 point,Thu Feb 26 17:34:18 2015 UTC,Ordered this morning. It is showing as almost gone for those on the fence.

PS4Deals,2x76ae,ravendies66,1 point,Fri Feb 27 01:28:03 2015 UTC,Buy has been around forever and is fine.  They had an issue with fraud once and it got blown out of proportion.
PS4Deals,2x71ms,DreadMcLaren,1 point,Thu Feb 26 03:52:40 2015 UTC,It says one game when I click :/
PS4Deals,2x71ms,GottaBeGrim,2,Tue Mar 3 21:54:54 2015 UTC,If you're taking about the voucher it gives you that is correct. You get 4 games to pick from and you choose ONE to have.

PS4Deals,2x0rlb,Th3muddler,2,Tue Feb 24 19:22:50 2015 UTC,Sorry for the sideways photo.
PS4Deals,2x0rlb,redpanda999,1 point,Tue Feb 24 23:16:05 2015 UTC,"So sad, I had such high expectations for this game"
PS4Deals,2x0rlb,Screamin11,2,Wed Feb 25 02:30:18 2015 UTC,It is a fantastic game really and you won't regret a playthrough. Just not worth $70 or a preorder. Wait for a price drop and enjoy.
PS4Deals,2x0rlb,astanix,2,Wed Feb 25 13:28:20 2015 UTC,What if I hate QTEs and FMVs? Still worth it?
PS4Deals,2x0rlb,Screamin11,1 point,Wed Feb 25 15:46:50 2015 UTC,"I hate QTEs with a passion and, while there were some rage inducing QTE moments, the quality of the production made up for it."
PS4Deals,2x0rlb,swotam,1 point,Wed Feb 25 16:04:04 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I played and finished the game and really enjoyed it. I think it's received a lot more negativity than it deserved, and most people I know who played it seemed to like it."
PS4Deals,2x0rlb,Screamin11,1 point,Wed Feb 25 17:57:42 2015 UTC,It will surely be featured on every underrated game list from here on.
PS4Deals,2x0rlb,SoulGreat,4,Wed Feb 25 18:38:14 2015 UTC,"To be honest, all I have read for reviews is that it's really fun but a short game, not worth the $70.  So I guess retailers are actually listening to the consumers?"
PS4Deals,2x0rlb,swotam,2,Wed Feb 25 03:50:42 2015 UTC,"More like they can't sell any otherwise. Heard it's a tough sale at EB games. Should be glad a Canadian retailer is having any deal at all, so soon into release. We normally need to wait months for any halfway decent deal."
PS4Deals,2x0rlb,swotam,0,Wed Feb 25 12:41:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess they're having trouble moving copies because of all the YouTube stupidity from last week. It's unfortunate because it's a really good game. Amazon was also offering a $20 credit with purchase, that promo ends tonight at midnight."
PS4Deals,2x0rlb,jpwinkis,1 point,Wed Feb 25 18:04:48 2015 UTC,"It's actually not that short, it took me 11 or 12 hours to complete the game on Hard. Mind you I died more times than I would like so some of that time was spent repeating certain sections until I succeeded, but in general the game is nowhere near the 5.5 hour mark that was all over YouTube.  I know that the video shows it being completed in that amount of time, but having played the game I have no idea how you would get it done that fast, even on Easy. The game requires a certain minimum amount of time to complete, and IMO that's way too quick.  I'd personally recommend it to anyone with a PS4. It looks incredible, sounds great, has an interesting story and decent gameplay. Is it worth $70? That's up to the buyer really, but I honestly can't complain. True, it's not going to give you 50+ hours of gameplay like Assassin's Creed, but then you're not spending 20 of those hours running around opening chests and collecting floating bits of light either..."
PS4Deals,2wtknf,Golden_Taint,3,Mon Feb 23 01:15:20 2015 UTC,If it is a really great deal can we use exclamation points? Sometimes these things are exciting. Thanks for all you guys do.
PS4Deals,2wtknf,DrinkMilk_saysthecat,2,Mon Feb 23 02:23:31 2015 UTC,"No, BUT you can add a ""Top Deal"" flair. Way better than an exclamation point. ;)"
PS4Deals,2wtknf,swotam,1 point,Mon Feb 23 03:32:18 2015 UTC,Just curious where the options for that are? I don't see any flair options for my posts.
PS4Deals,2wtknf,GoiterGlitter,1 point,Fri Feb 27 16:14:35 2015 UTC,Are you using the desktop format or an app?
PS4Deals,2wtknf,swotam,1 point,Sat Feb 28 11:28:51 2015 UTC,"Using the full website on a desktop with Chrome as the browser. Flair for other subreddits works, I just don't see if on this sub."
PS4Deals,2wtknf,swotam,1 point,Sat Feb 28 16:32:42 2015 UTC,I added flair but had the options set incorrectly. It's fixed now!
PS4Deals,2wtknf,antwan911,1 point,Sun Mar 1 09:37:17 2015 UTC,"Yup, works now, thx."
PS4Deals,2wtknf,GetVladimir,1 point,Sun Mar 1 14:52:56 2015 UTC,What about deals that affect multiple countries? A couple recent deals posted were targeted towards the US but also valid in Canada.  As a Canadian I still need to check all the US-deals I'm interested in because about 10% (of the ones I check) include Canada in the fine print. Similar things may be true for the UK-based subscribers.
PS4Deals,2wsf18,lyanna_rayne,3,Sun Feb 22 19:48:05 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about doing this tonight,  will they price match and do the 10% off or is it one or the other?"
PS4Deals,2wsf18,Risingicarus,2,Wed Feb 25 15:12:59 2015 UTC,"You can do both, here are the official rules, I would take a look at that before going in store. As an example, I got far cry 3 for 30% off and price match off of amazon. So with tax I only paid 29.95."
PS4Deals,2wsf18,Risingicarus,1 point,Wed Feb 25 16:48:23 2015 UTC,You sir are a god.
PS4Deals,2wsf18,badnewsjukebox,2,Wed Feb 25 17:37:39 2015 UTC,"Does target price match bundles? Like amazons ps4, TLOU 1886 for 430?"
PS4Deals,2wsf18,Risingicarus,2,Wed Feb 25 18:10:35 2015 UTC,"I'm planning to find that out tonight but so far everyone is saying yes. I'm even gonna go as far as to see if they will drop to the 380 price for the bundle off Amazon ,as it's still new."
PS4Deals,2wsf18,STOCK2MAILMAN42,1 point,Wed Feb 25 18:47:39 2015 UTC,"For price matching, what they do is scan the barcode and look for the item online, So as long as the serial number matches you are fine."
PS4Deals,2wrxuu,DreadMcLaren,3,Sun Feb 22 17:31:25 2015 UTC,"so I've been out of the loop with gaming for a good minute, but I've holding out on getting a ps4, is this a good deal or should I wait for something better???"
PS4Deals,2wrxuu,nimbus72,2,Mon Feb 23 07:55:01 2015 UTC,it is so good! You also get The Last of Us Remastered for FREE
PS4Deals,2wrxuu,Alsharad,1 point,Mon Feb 23 12:27:56 2015 UTC,I'm in the same boat. I went for this deal.
PS4Deals,2wrxuu,Yidfixy,1 point,Mon Feb 23 16:31:19 2015 UTC,If you have a need for for the PSTV - which you probably don't since you said you've been out of the loop. I would never use the PSTV so it's just a nice paperweight -  and Best Buy will charge tax I'm hoping NewEgg has something soon (no tax!)- preferably a bundle with 1886 & TLOU ( not GTAV) i.e. the non PC 'exclusives'
PS4Deals,2wrxuu,Johnny_Guano,1 point,Mon Feb 23 16:50:50 2015 UTC,Amazon has that bundle right now.
PS4Deals,2wrxuu,ArtoriasBIG,1 point,Tue Feb 24 07:47:17 2015 UTC,"I saw the amazon bundle, but amazon charges tax, well here CA, and its arms and leg tax. I wish they would re-release the GTA bundle for 399. I might just sell the PSTV if I go for this bundle."
PS4Deals,2wrxuu,nimbus72,2,Tue Feb 24 08:24:32 2015 UTC,"Oh, Amazon is perfect for me because there's no tax for them here. I also happen to have a student e-mail so I got that student Prime and free 2 day shipping."

PS4Deals,2wrxuu,nimbus72,1 point,Tue Feb 24 08:34:53 2015 UTC,You mean the 1886 TLOU for $429? I'd grab that if I didn't have to pay tax (an extra $40). I 'm hoping Newegg will put it up too.
PS4Deals,2wrxuu,Johnny_Guano,2,Tue Feb 24 10:31:09 2015 UTC,I bought this too as I have a use for pstv.
PS4Deals,2wrxuu,SJSquishy,1 point,Mon Feb 23 22:45:10 2015 UTC,"I just bought mine this past weekend, should they still give me the deal if I go back in within 30 days?"
PS4Deals,2wrxuu,skeezuschrsit,3,Mon Feb 23 02:22:43 2015 UTC,"Yes - I did the same thing as you. If you bring it back with the receipt, they'll return the system, put your money on a gift card and ""resell"" it to you along with the PSTV. Went through the process today, pretty painless. FYI I think you only have 15 days from the original sale (not to mention how long the deal is offered for) - also, I got the last one in the store so you may want to check the stock before you go."
PS4Deals,2wkke0,swotam,3,Fri Feb 20 18:12:31 2015 UTC,"Edit: Deal is over  Edit: Several people, including myself, have been able to get Amazon.ca to apply the $20 account credit on The Order: 1886 pre-orders placed during the June 2014 E3 sale by using the Customer Service Chat, so that brings the cost down to roughly $26 when the E3 discounts are taken into effect. YMMV, keep trying. Offer is valid until 11:59 PST on Feb 25.  Amazon.ca is offering a $20 account credit when you purchase The Order:1886 on PS4. They're selling the game for $66.99 $65.80 CAD so with the credit you're paying roughly $46 before tax. Note that the account credit will be applied to your account when the game ships, so it'll be applicable on your next purchase, not this one. However, if you buy from Amazon.ca regularly it's not a bad deal.  Plus, given how short the game is you can probably sell it used for around what you paid for it after a few days.  Here are the full terms from Amazon.ca:   To receive this promotion place the The Order: 1886 Standard Edition for PS4 in your cart. Your account will be credited when your item ships, and your credit will automatically be applied to your next qualifying purchase. Offer expires at 11:59 p.m. (PT) Feb 25, 2015. Offer only applies to products sold and shipped by Amazon.ca. Offer does not apply to digital content. Offer good while supplies last. Items must be purchased in a single order and shipped at the same speed to a single address. Shipping charges may apply to discounted and free promotional items. Offer limited to one per customer and account. Amazon reserves the right to modify or cancel the offer at any time. Offer is non-transferable and may not be resold. Offer discount will be allocated proportionally among all promotional items in your order. If any of the products or content related to this offer are returned, your refund will equal the amount you paid for the product or content, subject to applicable refund policies. If you violate any of these terms, the offer will be invalid. Unless an Amazon Gift Card is the stated benefit of the promotion, promotional codes (including those placed directly in accounts) may not be redeemed for Amazon Gift Cards.

PS4Deals,2wkke0,NakedSnakeEyes,1 point,Sat Feb 21 00:39:22 2015 UTC,"the link in the OP is currently directing toward a third party seller who has it at $59.99   When I click the link I posted it takes me to the Amazon item for $66.99, not a third party item. Not sure why you'd see differently, but your link and my link point to the same item."
PS4Deals,2wkke0,NakedSnakeEyes,1 point,Sat Feb 21 03:07:03 2015 UTC,"I think it's because your link points to the product's page in general, and when I was looking at the site, the third party seller was the lowest price so that's the price that was featured on the product page. The link I found was by manually choosing Amazon as the (higher priced at the time) seller and adding it to my cart, then following the link from the cart. My guess is your link's back to showing Amazon because the third party seller no longer has the lowest price.  I just checked your link and it does now go to the Amazon price and seller."
PS4Deals,2wkke0,Screamin11,2,Sat Feb 21 04:59:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's probably it. Will keep that in mind for next time."

PS4Deals,2wkke0,NakedSnakeEyes,2,Sat Feb 21 19:08:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the heads-up, just did the same!"

Ask to speak to an account specialist and stay on the line until you're able to checkout. The code was delivered in about 10 or 20 minutes. I'm gonna redeem it not. Thanks, OP! I'm going to pick up the TT Games Collection. Eta: I just picked up another card to take advantage of the $15 back on $100 deal. I had no problem. Try PayPal if you're having an issue. The deal is definitely still good!"

EDIT: Don't know what I did, but after 7 attempts, 2 different PC's, and lots of double-checking for errors on both Paypal, and Ebay, It finally went through. If it all works as plan, an email and code should follow suit. For all others trying to get it to work, I would recommend, just giving it time between attempts."
PS4Deals,2wk118,Qunquistador,1 point,Wed Feb 25 19:32:18 2015 UTC,"Sorry about that, I didn't see your post. The issue was most certainly on PayPal's end. One rep said there was a flag on it, but the wouldn't clarify what kind. They said they removed it and it might take a few hours, but after a day I still couldn't make the purchase.  So I called back and another rep said that my bank was denying the payment for some reason. The problem was, there was no way to change the method of payment when I was checking out. I'm not sure what she did, but she made it so my debit card was charged rather than straight from the bank while I was on the line with her. After that, I was able to change my method of payment on my own.   The deal is still good right now 2/26 and ends in 18 hours. If checkout doesn't work, give PayPal a call and ask to speak with an account rep until they fix your issue."

PS4Deals,2w68gi,Vecuronium,1 point,Tue Feb 17 14:25:25 2015 UTC,"Remember, in general you don't have to buy used to get a deal. You said you usually wait to buy a game, games routinely start to go on sale 30-60 days after release. If a game drops to $49 on sale, this let's you buy it for $39. A sale price of $39 drops to $31, and so on. It also means that if a game comes out that you really want to have day one, those $59.99 prices drop to $47.99."

PS4Deals,2w68gi,pork_slap,2,Tue Feb 17 23:13:25 2015 UTC,Well if you're planning to purchase 4 new games at 60$ a piece then that would be 48$ saved. 48$ minus the thirty you pay for the membership would save you a total of 18$. So I'd say it's worth it.
PS4Deals,2w68gi,naturr,2,Tue Feb 17 23:28:37 2015 UTC,"It's basically the same price as Gamestop's ""Pro"" program, $15 per year. Except Gamestop's club gives you 0% discount on new games, it SUCKS compared to Best Buy's.   As /u/nicklepickle858 said, you'll save $48 if you buy 4 full price games using your GCU membership. You'll also have this membership for more saving for a two years total, which covers holiday/Black Friday sales 2015 and 2016. That's huge, and you'll make your money back almost right away making the rest of your savings a huge bonus."

PS4Deals,2w68gi,BadNewsBrown,2,Thu Feb 19 01:53:01 2015 UTC,"No, it'll post 15 days after you pick it up, it'll be attached to your Rewards account. Also, Best Buy gives a $5 reward for every 250 points ($250 spent) a regular rewards customer gets. GCU members get double points on all Best Buy purchases, so the  $47.99 you're spending on the game not only gets a $10 reward, it'll get you almost halfway to another $5. You'll find that if you buy games even semi-frequently, rewards just tend to show up, it's a nice extra bonus."

PS4Deals,2w4uhu,nohitter21,4,Wed Feb 18 01:50:36 2015 UTC,i called Target and a customer service agent told me its for in stores only.. maybe someone else can confirm the same?

PS4Deals,2vtyhx,DMS0205,1 point,Sat Feb 14 18:24:28 2015 UTC,Their system automatically gives you the 30% off. Just make sure to ask to pricematch the game first and THEN hand them the preorder card as if it is an afterthought.

The overkill themselves have said themselves that they will make an official announcement when there is a release date or any information and they havn't said a peep about it since announcing that it was an idea. Several sites have taken it on their own to put up dates and prices but there is nothing official yet. Keep watch at /r/paydaytheheist.
PS4Deals,2vrofh,DJexs,1 point,Sat Feb 14 02:31:37 2015 UTC,Too bad I learned my lesson on ps3.  While this game is extremely fun the developers practically refused to support the console version.
PS4Deals,2vrofh,Lord_of_Brownies,1 point,Fri Feb 13 23:18:16 2015 UTC,Mostly because it used to cost a bunch of money to update games on PS3 which is money they didn't have

This is the right price for this game.  Took me, I don't know, 25 hours? Did about 80% of the stuff and didn't feel like collecting more plants, lol. Played the crap outta it for a few weeks though.  If you've been waiting, and aren't gonna play The Order in two weeks, this is a damn good game for a great price (FWIW my buddy with a PC with a 1 year old fairly high end card said looked better on my ps4 than his computer)."
PS4Deals,2vexmb,bscotchcummerbunds,2,Wed Feb 11 03:28:12 2015 UTC,"Your comment makes me want to get the game even more. I just really prefer if it is the digital version.  I've just got the digital version of Far Cry 4 (it's now something like $24.99 in those pick 1 of 4 bundle deals), so I'm in no hurry to get The Order.  I would actually grab Mordor and Dying Light first, if the price is right.  And you're right about the PS4. I think they don't optimise these type of games for PC so much as they do on consoles. I'm switching most of my gaming to console lately :)"

PS4Deals,2vby73,Unfortunate_Casper,3,Tue Feb 10 01:47:46 2015 UTC,i second this?
PS4Deals,2vby73,TY1901,3,Tue Feb 10 02:06:52 2015 UTC,"Nope, they send it through mail. I've dealt with Groupon many times. It takes at least 2 weeks and a half minimum for it to arrive as well."
PS4Deals,2vby73,concepts59,2,Tue Feb 10 17:01:27 2015 UTC,Is it as buggy as everyone says?
PS4Deals,2vby73,medicatedmonkey,2,Tue Feb 10 01:47:27 2015 UTC,It was upon release but has gotten better with a few updates. The devs are planning to release another update before months end that will address the multiplayer bugs too.
PS4Deals,2vby73,anduin2000,2,Tue Feb 10 12:51:34 2015 UTC,Is this code redeemable with EU psn account?
PS4Deals,2vby73,vinny1231,2,Tue Feb 10 12:05:32 2015 UTC,Mentions shipping at the bottom. Going tk assume its a card with a code they mail to you.

PS4Deals,2vc6kj,LiquidFootie,3,Tue Feb 10 02:44:14 2015 UTC,"Edit: Sale is now over.  This game didn't get the best reviews, but players seemed to like it more than the critics did. Either way, $15 for a PS4 title isn't bad, usually sells for $30. Available for in-store pickup, sold out online.  Edit: I picked it up, it's only $15 which is less than I pay for a single day of commuter train fare. It's not that bad, runs well on the PS4 and the story is interesting enough. Got a couple of hours into the story and all it all it seems decent."
PS4Deals,2vc6kj,DarkRaven47,2,Mon Feb 9 20:41:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I got it on sale for $19.99 iirc. It was worth it, imo. Full price? Definitely not. But I enjoyed the story enough. I think it's worth $14.99."
PS4Deals,2vc6kj,rattus,1 point,Tue Feb 10 16:42:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, decided to get it because $15 is pretty cheap and as long as the game amuses me for a few hours I can't complain. All in all it seems fairly good. Not great, but not terrible either. I guess it's good enough."
PS4Deals,2vc6kj,rattus,1 point,Wed Feb 11 16:42:40 2015 UTC,Standard console launch title rules apply here.
PS4Deals,2vc6kj,EnfieldCNC,1 point,Tue Feb 10 16:29:13 2015 UTC,The game released in June 2014 so I don't really think it qualifies as a launch title on next gen consoles that released 8 months earlier. YMMV.

The clerk told me they didn't sell games, but checked the system to make sure, and lo and behold it said they had one in stock. He dug around in the back and found it for me.

Now you're down to getting a new ps4 for like $150. Also don't have to buy the console from bestbuy, $150 can go a long ways towards games if you preorder and have gamers club unlocked"

Definitely believable, but at the same time from my experience at Target, the prices have probably never been updated in the first place.. so that's why a game that's $40 at BestBuy/FutureShop/anywhere is still $60-70 at Target.

PS4Deals,2ujly1,kisorcerer,1 point,Thu Feb 5 16:58:08 2015 UTC,"Just a reminder! Make sure that it's sold and shipped by Amazon, if it says it's sold by some random company and fulfilled by amazon, you won't get the promotion.  From what I've seen, this is probably the best offer out there right now, because the 1 year of psn costs $50 typically, and The Last of Us Remastered costs around $40. So, essentially, you're paying $310 for the console which is awesome!  Looking forward to my new ps4, love this sub :)"

PS4Deals,2ud232,kimkam1898,6,Sun Feb 1 01:15:04 2015 UTC,Still annoying that a customer has to import Magma Red to NA.  The white's also $50. Very nice color.
PS4Deals,2ud232,dark_delight,3,Sun Feb 1 17:56:52 2015 UTC,Seems all colors are on sale. Blue is the cheapest. Next to white/black/camo. I'm tempted.   Edit: Ordered the blue one! This will be for my pc so I don't have to keep pairing my controllers
PS4Deals,2ud232,adinunzio10,2,Sun Feb 1 18:59:48 2015 UTC,Ugh.. I'm still waiting for the PS4 controller + Injustice to be around this price.  It was $42 in December.

The sound is great, the mic quality is good, and virtual 7.1 made Man of Steel sound like I was back in the theater.  But they are awfully uncomfortable.

The amount of work that Creative Assembly put into ensuring the game was faithful to the look and feel of Ridley Scott's Alien is incredible.   If you are a fan of Alien, or a fan of Survival Horror, you owe it to yourself to get this game! Now!!  And before someone mentions the pathetic IGN review, I'll just say IGN is full of shit. No idea what game the reviewer was playing but this wasn't it. The game I played was a GOTY contender."

Its like your getting BF4 completely free and a 50% discount on premium.    That is fucking insane.      It had a horrible launch but its stable now and amazing.

PS4Deals,2tvms8,mymartyrcomplex,1 point,Wed Jan 28 21:00:50 2015 UTC,"I contacted Sony and my idiot first wanted me to delete file, issue a full refund, then wait 3-5 days for the refund to process, and then once it went through, repurchase and download the game at the lower price. What a pain in the ass. Eventually, she said that as long as I didn't play the game until the refund went through, and re-bought it at the $24 price, I would be able to simply re-authorize the game, so that's the route I went.  I did immediately ask if they could just put the difference in price back on my wallet, but she didn't seem to think that was possible. It'd only be the easiest thing to do where nobody is really inconvenienced. Some of these people shouldn't be working at a place they don't know what the fuck they are talking about."
PS4Deals,2tvms8,Wood_Ape,1 point,Wed Jan 28 21:34:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had it on PS3, but got really sick of the latency. It plays horrendously on PS3 still. I played it a lot for a couple of months and then put it down because it was pissing me off so much. The jump to PS4 has made a nice difference and being able to move my stats over from PS3 really helped. I didn't have premium on PS3 at all, so there's still a boatload left to do."
PS4Deals,2tvms8,Wood_Ape,1 point,Wed Jan 28 01:55:53 2015 UTC,I don't think there is. A friend just got it on PS4 after having it on PC and he wasn't given the option. I distinctly recall being offered the ability to move my stats over. It was a pop-up that appeared when I first loaded the game up after it had installed and whatnot.
PS4Deals,2tvms8,Wood_Ape,1 point,Wed Jan 28 02:07:09 2015 UTC,"This is amazing! My friend was waiting for a sale on premium, and here it is!"
PS4Deals,2tvms8,OneWayStreetPark,1 point,Wed Jan 28 15:59:36 2015 UTC,So what's the difference between standard and premium? Am I going to miss out on a lot if I just pick up the cheaper version?
PS4Deals,2tvms8,biezel,2,Wed Jan 28 21:30:09 2015 UTC,Premium includes a bunch of extra maps etc. (read the description at the link) and in my opinion you really want to get it if you have any interest in the multiplayer portion of the game which you should. :)  It was annoying when I didn't have the DLC in battlefield 3 and the next map was a DLC map. It just dropped me out of multiplayer.
PS4Deals,2tvms8,edhere,1 point,Wed Jan 28 02:07:55 2015 UTC,I bought the ps4 basic version on release but love the game should I invest in premium edition?
PS4Deals,2tvms8,deadmau5312,1 point,Wed Jan 28 13:53:20 2015 UTC,Yes I did the same at full price. It's awesome and I have no regrets. Spend the 20 and get 16 more maps

PS4Deals,2tvms8,deadmau5312,0,Wed Jan 28 15:02:42 2015 UTC,Not sure if this applies to the disc version but I lost my SP save file even after properly exiting and shutting down my ps4.  I was getting pretty far in hard mode so it felt quite depressing that I would have to start over.  Because of this issue I don't feel like playing sp again for a while in fear of it deleting itself again

PS4Deals,2tvxym,chandleross,3,Wed Jan 28 17:38:13 2015 UTC,"Same here, I can't decide if this game is a keeper. Online reviews are highly mixed. Some say that it;s reminiscent of Most Wanted, which alone should convince me to buy, but others say that it tries to be a mix of MW and Hot Pursuit, and does a bad job on both. If only this was physical, I would immediately buy it.."

PS4Deals,2tvxym,depelteau,1 point,Wed Jan 28 16:45:03 2015 UTC,"The gameplay is good, about on par or maybe a bit better than previous years. It still has the issue where you will be ahead and the computer will miraculously come back to tie it and you won't be able to stop it.  They removed a bunch of game modes like season and EASHL, which a lot of people were upset about. I never really played those modes so it didn't really bother me. HUT is their cash cow now with all the microtransactions in it.   Overall it's a good game if you're just looking to play regular games offline or online. If you're looking for more, you'll most likely be disappointed."
PS4Deals,2tvxym,DreadMcLaren,1 point,Wed Jan 28 17:28:47 2015 UTC,"It was bad at release but I picked it up half price recently and it's amazing. The last I played before was the 09 so there's more features from my point of view. Hard to say it's worth $70 but $35, hell yeah."

PS4Deals,2tps8a,shenronz,3,Mon Jan 26 12:53:54 2015 UTC,Is it worth it at this price?
PS4Deals,2tps8a,Yellow-Stain,4,Mon Jan 26 17:30:16 2015 UTC,"$30 for sure.  Most the bugs have been fixed, Co-op/multiplayer runs smoother.  So many side missions it will make your head hurt.  The new assassin moves are sick. Lots of content if you like that sort of thing."
PS4Deals,2tps8a,sun-up-sun-down,2,Mon Jan 26 19:01:59 2015 UTC,"How is the modern day story? I know that is usually an after thought compared to playing as the Assassin but am just wondering if they put something decent together for Unity.  Also, how is the co-op? Are there set missions for co-op? Are there a lot of them? Do they work well?"
PS4Deals,2tps8a,DarkRaven47,2,Tue Jan 27 13:13:48 2015 UTC,"The Abstergo story?  Far less intrusive than Black Flag IMO.  Semi-Spoiler.  Set missions for co-op, but you can play them by yourself as well.  I think there are 10 or so.  They are a lot of fun with 4 people, basically you can just go and murder everyone.  Also, there are club competitions but I haven't gotten into those too much."
PS4Deals,2tps8a,sun-up-sun-down,3,Tue Jan 27 15:03:09 2015 UTC,"I rented and beat the story in around a week. The French Revolution is a pretty interesting time period and the plot and locale were interesting enough to keep me playing.  If you're a fan of the series, I think it's a pretty good addition and possibly worth the purchase. However, it does suffer from the normal trappings of AC games - repetitive quests, occasional glitches in movement and combat, and ridiculous assassin involvement in pivotal historic events. To me, it's worth playing, but not worth buying at this price."
PS4Deals,2tps8a,BeardofDeceit,1 point,Mon Jan 26 17:48:07 2015 UTC,"Hmmmm, what price do you think the game would be worth at? Also, if you've played the other Creed games how does it stack up to the others?   Black Flag is my favorite right now!"
PS4Deals,2tps8a,badtree132,1 point,Mon Jan 26 20:10:15 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I absolutely think it's worth it at this price. There's minimal to no bugs, good graphics, good gameplay. It's a good game."
PS4Deals,2tps8a,Ikarus3426,1 point,Tue Jan 27 04:15:02 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't pay more than $20, personally. As for rankings, I'd put this below AC II and IV and above the others in terms of entertainment. The plot is just alright, I'd say it's my least favorite of the AC stories."
PS4Deals,2tps8a,BeardofDeceit,1 point,Mon Jan 26 23:54:12 2015 UTC,"It is the same price at GameStop too. If you have PowerUp rewards, it is $25."

I mean, I don't really think it's that big of a deal.   They pricematch game x, but I want y.  I return x, and they give me y.  It's the same result, except I get y instead of x.  I'm not sure what they pay for these games, but it is probably close to the same price.   They're not losing any more money than if I had kept game x."

It has interchangeable rubbers so you can tailor the fit to you ear. Another bonus is that you can play the audio coming from the tv through the earphones, great if you want to be immersed and not bother others. I noticed I can tell where things are going on in the game just form the directional sound, great for pvp!"

PS4Deals,2tay9o,megachickabutt,2,Thu Jan 22 17:01:35 2015 UTC,Throwing in a 7200rpm hard drive could drain more power then the regular 5400 hard drive.  Sony does not recommend upgrading to 7200 rpm and advises you to upgrade to a 5400rpm. Same thing goes with hybrid and solid state drives. That being said you probably wont have any problems and this is a good price.  Just be warned lol.  Also as someone who upgraded my hdd on Tuesday of this week.  I am literally still waiting for all my games to download.  So just be aware re downloading your games is gonna take a bit of time; because as far as I know you cannot transfer the old hard drive because of the ps4 encryption.
PS4Deals,2tay9o,DJexs,2,Fri Jan 23 13:03:47 2015 UTC,I've been running a 7200 RPM hard drive since day one… I installed before even turned on my PlayStation the first time. It's been running fine and I haven't noticed any problems at all he does not an issue I stand my vertically also.

PS4Deals,2tay9o,HowieGaming,1 point,Fri Jan 23 17:00:15 2015 UTC,I just went through this on Monday this week and you need PS+ for it to work. It does not happen automatically. First of all you need to have the game installed. So if you want your saves for GTAV you would need to download /install all of the game. Then you go into options and application data management and download each saves for each game manually. Hope this helps.

Sometimes you'll see an immediate charge as they confirm that the card is valid, but it'll drop off in a couple days, it'll basically show as a pending charge but never go through and post.  If you're not sure you could call and ask them about pre-order policy. I would NOT mention these prices in case they're a mistake. ;)"

PS4Deals,2sxtjb,amin456789,1 point,Mon Jan 19 20:30:47 2015 UTC,why avoid this? the seller will be the one in the losing side anyway since the buyer can do a chargeback and when ebay reviews the dispute and sees this as a digital code you will get both your money and still keep the code.  the only reason why seller ships the item is because ebay suspends and limits the accounts and paypals of sellers doing this if caught.
PS4Deals,2sxtjb,guiltygearz,0,Mon Jan 19 22:24:14 2015 UTC,Did they email you the code? I wasn't emailed one.

PS4Deals,2sv0td,LazyassedNinja,2,Sun Jan 18 20:31:51 2015 UTC,Only using the 35% off would get you the game for about $40 (the same price as Amazon). YMMV but if you're able to get them to price match Amazon and then scan the coupon you would get the game for about $26.
PS4Deals,2sv0td,callito,1 point,Sun Jan 18 20:34:31 2015 UTC,How do you price match if your using the wheel app?

PS4Deals,2sbbpk,djbeks,1 point,Wed Jan 14 16:23:45 2015 UTC,Most folks at /r/ps4 seem to say it is worth the $12.
PS4Deals,2sbbpk,luizribeiro,2,Wed Jan 14 17:31:42 2015 UTC,I thought that playstation had discontinued the psp. I'd get some of these games for my psp go but I don't think I can access the store since I've installed homebrew and all that good shit on there.

PS4Deals,2sbbpk,s0vs0v,3,Wed Jan 14 15:04:22 2015 UTC,US PSN doesn't accept EU PayPals or credit cards. But if you have a .de Amazon acc just login on .com and add a US address to that.

(you wanna set this as Primary PS4 for this US account) Done   Buying games   Top up US account using Amazon (buying vouchers) Redeem PSN voucher codes on your US PSN account. ??? Profit   You could also buy games (digitally) from Amazon. But they don't have all the games that PSN does.

PS4Deals,2sbkxo,coepuffs,1 point,Wed Jan 14 19:27:21 2015 UTC,I'm looking at that one also. Getting some mixed reviews about it. It's either that or Killzone. Not much other choice for PS4

PS4Deals,2s68qx,Balorio,2,Tue Jan 13 14:40:51 2015 UTC,"My guess is they buy up bundles, take the codes out, and sell both separately. Not sure though."
PS4Deals,2s68qx,akellar,5,Tue Jan 13 20:56:28 2015 UTC,$30 for Far Cry 4 is a ridiculous steal. the amount of content for that price is stupid.

PS4Deals,2s68qx,Marklar_RR,2,Tue Jan 13 11:08:50 2015 UTC,I don't know it either. There are many people in their official forum got invalid codes. look at this thread I opened. it's downvoted too :S  http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/2s9n01/psa_gamedealdailycom_is_giving_away_invalid_codes/
PS4Deals,2s68qx,psfrtps,1 point,Tue Jan 13 11:22:50 2015 UTC,Yesterday evening they sent me a new code and it worked. At least they have good customer support.
PS4Deals,2s68qx,Marklar_RR,5,Wed Jan 14 08:08:05 2015 UTC,Just bought Far cry 4 and LBP3. It was a little confusing honestly but I was extremely skeptical too.   For the codes to work you have to enter them through another sony site specifically for the 4 for 1 games. Then sony gives you a code and you can add that the normal way through PSN.  TLDR  Paid 60 for both games. Redeemed and confirmed.
PS4Deals,2s68qx,raiin901,2,Tue Jan 13 08:47:29 2015 UTC,"My first experience with this site and they failed.

PS4Deals,2s68qx,Marklar_RR,2,Tue Jan 13 08:28:58 2015 UTC,I get this error frequently with psn credits and digital download games but it always shows up in my account. Its actually a fault of the playstation website.

PS4Deals,2s68qx,gopacktennie,1 point,Tue Jan 13 07:30:05 2015 UTC,You need a US PSN account to download the games right? So is it possible to download them on a US PSN account then play them from my hard drive on my EU account? Thanks in advance for any insight on this.
PS4Deals,2s68qx,fahim64,3,Tue Jan 13 12:15:51 2015 UTC,You can play it on any account by making the PSN account that you redeemed the game on Primary.

PS4Deals,2s68qx,darkdevil1100,1 point,Tue Jan 13 14:25:07 2015 UTC,"I dunno how that would work. As long as the US account has your console as it's ""home/primary"" console, then yeah. It'll work just fine.   Any DLC you buy MUST be from the US PSN store, though.  The only thing that I could see being an issue is lag, as your account is from the EU, and it'd probably connect to the US servers."
PS4Deals,2s68qx,Balorio,1 point,Tue Jan 13 14:39:15 2015 UTC,"All server connections are based on your current location, not the origin of your account."

The DLC for these games has to come from the US though, which is cheaper than AU anyway so no biggy. You just need to make sure the PS4 is set up as the main PS4 on your US account though.  And i've never had any lag that wasn't due to my slow connection with any US games, for me it has picked up AU servers instead of US for these games.  Let me know if you need more info on the setup, there are a heap of posts that tell you how."

PS4Deals,2s1xi3,Golden_Taint,2,Sun Jan 11 11:33:57 2015 UTC,Question since I'm not familiar with this game and want to get into Saints Row since I never did. Does this whole game take place in hell of is that the DLC? Is this Saints Row 4 with Gat out of Hell and Re-Elected included or is it just those 2. Or maybe I have it all wrong. Someone please clarify.
PS4Deals,2s1xi3,shinecrazy,3,Mon Jan 12 00:19:12 2015 UTC,"So Saints Row 4 takes place in the same city as SR3, if you've never played that think a usual open-world GTA style city. You are in a simulation of the city created by aliens and you are the president of the US, who happens to have super powers. Yeah... And Gat Out of Hell takes place after SR4, where the president is taken hostage by Satan, and Johnny Gat, the president's best friend, goes into hell to try to save him. So that's the summary."
PS4Deals,2s1xi3,BlitzKraig1,1 point,Mon Jan 12 00:22:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Just placed my preorder...basically $30 after GCU and gift card. I'll try SR3 one day if I like this one...I'm strictly PS4 at the moment, brother has my PS3."

It will also use the microphone to listen to the room and if a noise is made too loudly (like you scream or speak out of fear) then enemies will hear you.   Nifty features, I thought."

I know everyone saids it's useless right now because the lack of games for it but I was wondering about just dance. I played a demo of it at a mall and have a blast with my friends. But the demo was for the Xbox one with the kinect. I was wondering if the ps camera is as ""good"" as the kinect. Is just Dance worth buying a camera. ( I know the VR headset  might also need a camera soon too). And is the ps camera good at picking a group of people (4 people). I know the kinect can pick up like 5 and does a ok job of doing so. If anyone have just Dance for the ps4, is it worth it? Or should I skip it and the camera."

PS4Deals,2rq0ni,Moist_Vanguard,1 point,Sat Jan 10 03:11:39 2015 UTC,Well I just got my new ps4 two days before this deal started at the same store (gamestop) wonder if u go in if they would just give me the movie and the headset.
PS4Deals,2rnmpf,roastpork,3,Wed Jan 7 19:10:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting, just picked up Destiny and Far Cry 4. Got the code in seconds."
PS4Deals,2rnmpf,fob9546,3,Thu Jan 8 00:42:37 2015 UTC,Picked up LBP3 worked great! My wife thanks you OP
PS4Deals,2rnmpf,TheFudge,2,Thu Jan 8 02:36:10 2015 UTC,"Sold out :( I bought a few yesterday, but they are sold out now"
PS4Deals,2rnmpf,theedg,1 point,Thu Jan 8 14:34:02 2015 UTC,"Ok damnit drunken impulse time.   Is Destiny worth it if I have no interest in PvP and doubt I can commit the time required for raids?   I know raids have saves but as a father of two, husband and 65hr/wk job its not possible to hit it hard.  On a good night I have 2hrs to play..     Have tons of games I haven't gotten halfway through but seem to spend more time buying than playing lol.    Was in the alpha and beta but I got the impression you had to do crucible to get the best loot which I have no interest in at all"
PS4Deals,2rnmpf,dfrazier81,3,Thu Jan 8 03:41:36 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't get it. If you take away raids and the crucible you're left with a few repetitive missions, a very lackluster story, and a few daily events that will go away a little bit as each new DLC comes out and you choose not to get it. It'll be fun at first, but you'll eventually be annoyed about how you have to play with other people to get the best loot. There's plenty of other games for you."
PS4Deals,2rnmpf,Ikarus3426,2,Thu Jan 8 14:45:37 2015 UTC,"I have 300 hours in this game with 3 characters a level 32 and two 31s and I have played a total of about 20 pvp matches. You can gain xp quicker by also playing PvP matches but you don't have to at all. That being said, if you dont plan on doing the raids this game might not be for you. The story isn't all that good and once it's over, if you're not trying to max you character out for the raids there's no real point in playing."
PS4Deals,2rnmpf,MrPennywise,2,Thu Jan 8 06:55:30 2015 UTC,"Crucible is the worst PVP thing ever, AND not needed for advancement. I step in to knock out quick exotic bounties and otherwise do not touch it. It's like shitty Halo. Small maps, small teams, no good vehicles, no fun goofy modes. It's like they forgot how to make a good PVP title.  I do not raid (too long of a session) at all and have fun with it, I feel like I got my money's worth so far. The shooting etc.. is very well done and the graphics and sound. Literally NOTHING else is more than merely competent- so it is hard to recommend, but it is enjoyable shooting."
PS4Deals,2rnmpf,Webecomemonsters,1 point,Thu Jan 8 15:47:39 2015 UTC,"Maybe?  It's a diablo-esque 'loot grind' game that has a rather small number of dungeons and 2 'raids'.  Personally, I loved it up until I hit the need for daily mission grinds for a chance at uniques and running around the planet for upgrade ingredients (luckily they have fixed this so you no longer have to farm them this way).  It's fun. Its a well put together shooter. But it has a lackluster amount of content, sparse matchmaking options and is a bit too grindy for me (and I love MMO/BL/Diablo style grind sessions).  If you have limited time, I'd probably say wait it out for more features and content."
PS4Deals,2rnmpf,HashRunner,1 point,Thu Jan 8 15:17:18 2015 UTC,"I would've bought FC4 + Destiny if I didn't already have 15+ other games that I haven't even begun to play yet (thanks to Black Friday).  Hopefully by the time I'm ready to buy more games, these 2 will be on sale for even cheaper."

PS4Deals,2rnmpf,Freezerboard,3,Thu Jan 8 01:24:38 2015 UTC,I never received my pick 1 of 4 code. I'm currently in the claim process with my bank seeing as paypal couldn't help me.

PS4Deals,2ropy3,Golden_Taint,3,Thu Jan 8 00:06:11 2015 UTC,"This is in store only, not available to ship. Most stores are probably out, what this is good for is the good ol' price match at Walmart or Best Buy. It might be a little hit or miss as some associates will verify the local Sears has stock, most won't. From my personal experience, your best bet is to just head to the front cashier at Best Buy, ask for the game, then tell them you have a price match at Sears. Usually they'll just let you show them on your phone and you're good to go."
PS4Deals,2ropy3,jdimaria3,1 point,Thu Jan 8 00:08:24 2015 UTC,Last time I tried price matching at Best Buy (a couple weeks ago) they told me they didn't do Sears. Hopefully this time things will be different.
PS4Deals,2ropy3,coolgaara,2,Fri Jan 9 21:33:36 2015 UTC,"So everyone should know at this point your only shot is price match through BestBuy, Walmart, Target etc."
PS4Deals,2ropy3,serfis,3,Thu Jan 8 01:44:09 2015 UTC,"Not Target, they have a strict list of competitors that they'll match, Sears isn't on the list."
PS4Deals,2ropy3,serfis,2,Thu Jan 8 01:51:26 2015 UTC,Did they recently remove them? I've gotten Sears deals price matched there not too long ago.
PS4Deals,2ropy3,RespectThyHypnotoad,2,Thu Jan 8 06:26:21 2015 UTC,"No, they've never been on it. You might've had an employee who just didn't know better, they're usually pretty strict."
PS4Deals,2ropy3,IamBADasianDRIVER,1 point,Thu Jan 8 06:37:13 2015 UTC,I guess so. I'll take it I guess
PS4Deals,2ropy3,brynon,1 point,Thu Jan 8 12:32:05 2015 UTC,"I've always been able to price match at target with ease, best buy has been the biggest fuckers with it. I could get the same product from an approved place and they still say no."

PS4Deals,2rjif7,ColinZealSE,1 point,Wed Jan 7 12:54:42 2015 UTC,On EU store they are live (might need to clear cache on browser to get the updated site. PSN store is clunky like that). Haven't checked the Australian store though.

PS4Deals,2rhs0z,anusdotcom,3,Tue Jan 6 07:23:44 2015 UTC,Don't pre-order this game at all. Wait.
PS4Deals,2rhs0z,LarryLips,1 point,Tue Jan 6 14:39:23 2015 UTC,It's there a reason for this? Just curious.
PS4Deals,2rhs0z,dewittism,2,Tue Jan 6 16:04:51 2015 UTC,"Pre-ordering is just a bad idea in general I think. I always see people on reddit complaining that they bought a game before even finding out if it was good or not. Well, just wait for reviews and there will not be a problem."
PS4Deals,2rhs0z,happyflappypancakes,1 point,Tue Jan 6 19:12:54 2015 UTC,"I have a hard time believing Evolve will find itself it the under/poorly developed category.

PS4Deals,2rhs0z,dewittism,2,Tue Jan 6 19:55:56 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I played the Alpha and when I could get into a game it was a blast. Although the fact that they are keeping a whole monster out of the game and just for pre-orders kinda puts me off the whole thing TBH."
PS4Deals,2rhs0z,happyflappypancakes,1 point,Tue Jan 6 20:55:02 2015 UTC,"That is a drag. But hey, we live in a pay to play era."
PS4Deals,2rhs0z,dewittism,1 point,Tue Jan 6 22:09:57 2015 UTC,"This is totally not meant as a diss to you, I just find myself wondering if there will ever come a time when something or someone finally gets over the ""oh well"" mindset and actually moves to change the industry back to the way it was in the early 2000s. Patches and updates are great, but internet connectivity feels like it has led to sloppy development from people who once had solid gaming experiences they released. I loved preordering games, but after Destiny (played the alpha, loved it, bought the game, disliked it after a week), I'm hesitant."
PS4Deals,2rhs0z,brandenholder,1 point,Fri Jan 9 16:30:31 2015 UTC,I am totally in agreement but i would rather spend my energy on my family rather than raging against the video game industry machine.
PS4Deals,2rhs0z,dewittism,1 point,Fri Jan 9 17:50:55 2015 UTC,Have you tried the alpha at all? You can't really say that if you havent' even tried teh game for yourself. I am going to pre-order but from Nuuvem which you can get for around $35 instead of $60.
PS4Deals,2rhs0z,coolgaara,2,Tue Jan 6 22:24:42 2015 UTC,"FYI, I pre-ordered Shadow of Mordor through them with this promo, you get the gift card code in about 15 days. They also have a free program called ""Dell Advantage"" you can sign up for that will give you free 2 day shipping.   In my case, they accidently sent me two gift card codes so I got $50 off of Dragon Age: Inquisition, plus the 2 day shipping. Oh yeah. :)"

PS4Deals,2rfrd8,thedaradotcom,4,Tue Jan 6 04:31:47 2015 UTC,Buy the PE then sell your disc version. You can still probably get $20-25 for it so you're basically getting premium for $5.

PS4Deals,2reywh,Guypussy,2,Mon Jan 5 17:03:52 2015 UTC,Why physical games are cheaper than digital?
PS4Deals,2reywh,martu,2,Mon Jan 5 21:21:32 2015 UTC,Amazon only has so much warehouse space to dedicate to various products. Digital stores don't have to worry about physical space outside of servers and one or two offices in each region.
PS4Deals,2reywh,ruthloose,1 point,Tue Jan 6 20:26:31 2015 UTC,Anyone think this will be a free ps+ game soon? It's been on sale so often maybe they are trying to get more sales out of it before it's free.
PS4Deals,2reywh,af27,1 point,Tue Jan 6 02:48:14 2015 UTC,"Considering they are giving away the DLC for it this month with PS+, I can't imagine it'll be a freebie for at least a few more months so they can space it out."
PS4Deals,2reywh,one800higgins,1 point,Tue Jan 6 05:27:41 2015 UTC,Can you play the DLC to see if you like the game style without the base game or is it required to play First Light?
PS4Deals,2reywh,Arcades,1 point,Tue Jan 6 21:54:10 2015 UTC,"I do believe it is standalone and if it's a free PS+ game than I imagine that is true. They have never given away DLC as far as I know, aside from Far Cry Blood Dragon which was standalone. I don't have it yet."
PS4Deals,2reywh,one800higgins,1 point,Tue Jan 6 23:52:29 2015 UTC,It's a standalone game; I played it last night.
PS4Deals,2reywh,needhaje,1 point,Wed Jan 7 20:00:49 2015 UTC,I just dont see it happening. Not with first light dlc being free.
PS4Deals,2reywh,Gooeygoetta,1 point,Tue Jan 6 19:03:49 2015 UTC,"All first party games will be free at some point, just depends on if you can wait (they have to do this, or they will run out of PS+ titles, there just is not much software available for PS4). I do not buy sony published titles for this reason until they are dramatically reduced in price."

PS4Deals,2ra76g,Golden_Taint,7,Sun Jan 4 07:13:34 2015 UTC,"I personally had a LOT of fun with this game. You play a superhero that can absorb abilities from the things in the world. It's open world in Seattle, and you have the ability to be a superhero or a super-villain.  And the graphics are outstanding."
PS4Deals,2ra76g,tydude001,3,Sun Jan 4 08:01:54 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I had a lot of fun with the game. I just thought it was too short. Not a whole ton to do in the world and I found it to be kind of small. I personally don't think it warranted the $60 release price, but for $20, I'd strongly consider it for anyone.  With PS+, first light (spin off game of one of the companions you meet in second son) is free this month. Same type of gameplay. Give it a try for sure!"
PS4Deals,2ra76g,Freezerboard,1 point,Sun Jan 4 08:36:02 2015 UTC,"Being evil or good truly does have a significant effect on the story, however. Perhaps not the large, main events, but a lot of little things."

PS4Deals,2ra76g,Charblarger,1 point,Sun Jan 4 20:11:39 2015 UTC,From my understanding First Light is a precursor to Second Son.

PS4Deals,2r59n2,Danimaltanimal,10,Fri Jan 2 22:49:57 2015 UTC,Yes its been on sale all week.........   Anyways really good price for it.     I just bought again to have the digital version and immediately regretted not getting the premium version for $30 which is perhaps even more amazing.    Easily the best multiplayer fps on the ps4 and still looks incredible for a launch game.  Screenshots tend to look like crap but in motion is a whole other experience.     Would recommend to anyone that doesn't have it yet
PS4Deals,2r59n2,dfrazier81,1 point,Sat Jan 3 02:07:09 2015 UTC,So the base is 12 the premium is still 30?
PS4Deals,2r59n2,jakcoy7,4,Sat Jan 3 03:07:45 2015 UTC,Premium edition of the game is $30.  Includes the game and premium membership.   Right now premium membership stand alone is $50.   Goes on sale all of the time but I have never seen the ps4 membership go lower than $25.    I believe I saw a disc version of BF4 premium at walmart for $50 as well.     Overall $30 for it is a great deal...I am actually thinking about buying it again for that price rather than waiting for a sale lol.  Willing to buy the same game 3 times might be a little nutty though
PS4Deals,2r59n2,dfrazier81,2,Sat Jan 3 03:13:03 2015 UTC,What makes premium worth $18? I'm thinking about getting vanilla for $12.
PS4Deals,2r59n2,WilliamPoole,7,Sat Jan 3 03:19:38 2015 UTC,All of the dlc and a few other perks.   Honestly $30 is an insane price and if you think you would like BF4 you'll be kicking yourself later.  Best case scenario the premium membership will go on sale for $25 or $30 in a couple months
PS4Deals,2r59n2,dfrazier81,1 point,Sat Jan 3 03:25:30 2015 UTC,"I have it for 360, played a ton now want tog get it for my ps4 since it's cheap looks like premium"
PS4Deals,2r59n2,jakcoy7,1 point,Sat Jan 3 03:28:50 2015 UTC,"Do the dlc maps get regular rotation online? Or is there a special playlist for DLC?  How are the dlc maps handled online? Unless they are in regular rotation, I can't see a reason to spend an extra 120% or so. Honest question as I am leaning towards vanilla."
PS4Deals,2r59n2,WilliamPoole,1 point,Sat Jan 3 06:25:44 2015 UTC,"I just have vanilla for now which is why I'm thinking about spending $30 to buy the game yet again to get premium lol.  Everything I have heard suggests that by far the most popular mode is the carrier battles (cant think of the actual name lol), which is one of the dlcs.  Stand alone each dlc is $15 and there are 4 of them.     Still tons of people play vanilla and its a great price for it but believe me when I say you will be hitting yourself if you end up liking it."
PS4Deals,2r59n2,dfrazier81,1 point,Sat Jan 3 17:21:48 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply
PS4Deals,2r59n2,WilliamPoole,1 point,Sat Jan 3 18:17:16 2015 UTC,The quick match servers are split into map packs. So you can pick which pack you want to play at that time. There are also custom servers you can search  for that may have a rotation of all maps or just a few number of maps.
PS4Deals,2r59n2,reversemicrowave,1 point,Sat Jan 3 17:57:52 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply
PS4Deals,2r59n2,WilliamPoole,1 point,Sat Jan 3 18:17:32 2015 UTC,"The best I can tell (I just got the premium a couple days ago), there are separate servers that run the different map packs. The random servers can change to whatever tho, but the official ones seem to rotate just thru what ever pack they have active. You shouldn't have trouble finding any games with regular maps or premium maps. Also, I suggest to get premium at this price. I had the regular game for months now and have gotten tired of the maps which is why I upgraded at this great price."

PS4Deals,2r59n2,MrEraserRain,1 point,Sat Jan 3 03:27:49 2015 UTC,Thanks. Are the maps in regular rotation?
PS4Deals,2r59n2,WilliamPoole,2,Sat Jan 3 06:34:41 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. Custom servers can have any rotation set by admins. Official servers have map rotations that only cycle the maps from a particular DLC or the base game. For instance, Final Stand official servers will only play the 4 Final Stand maps.  There are also some gametypes that are only playable on certain DLC packs. Examples are Chainlink (Dragons Teeth only) and Carrier Assault (Naval Assault).  Is it worth the price tag? Hell yes."

PS4Deals,2r59n2,8BitBatman,6,Sat Jan 3 13:22:01 2015 UTC,"Honestly, not worth it. The game truly shines because of the multiplayer alone. Single player is okay but it's not the main attraction."

PS4Deals,2r59n2,8BitBatman,2,Sat Jan 3 13:23:26 2015 UTC,Its a multiplayer focused game but for $12 I would say the single player is worth it.    Pretty short so just be prepared for that.  I have seen some Redboxes having BF4 on PS4 and that might be the cheaper way to burn through it.
PS4Deals,2r59n2,dfrazier81,2,Sun Jan 4 10:32:34 2015 UTC,When is the next battlefield due (not hardline)
PS4Deals,2r59n2,custom_85,1 point,Sat Jan 3 23:18:21 2015 UTC,Good question.  My understanding is that most of DICE's resources are invested in Star Wars Battlefront (release of 4th quarter 2015).
PS4Deals,2r59n2,variable_dissonance,1 point,Sat Jan 3 11:37:32 2015 UTC,"I read somewhere that while DICE is planning a holiday 2015 release of Star Wars Battlefront 3, they are also working on Battlefield 5 at the moment. They are planning on a holiday 2016 release. So there is plenty of time to play BF4."
PS4Deals,2r59n2,reversemicrowave,1 point,Sat Jan 3 13:25:36 2015 UTC,They have said they are doing 3yr cycles.  So holiday 2016 for Battlefield 5 would be a good bet.     I would guess Battlefront is possibly coming this year though.

PS4Deals,2r59n2,baconmoneybreath,1 point,Sat Jan 3 23:14:30 2015 UTC,You can buy the premium version of the game ($30) and it'll carry over.  I bought the disc from Amazon then the $30 premium game online and it allowed me to download all the DLC for free.

If you are talking about just the premium itself, one premium will work for both versions of the game. My buddy had bf4 and premium for ps3, but only had to buy BF4 for the ps4. His premium ownership allowed him to download premium for ps4 for free. If you already own bf4 for ps3, then this is the best option. If you don't own bf4 at all yet, I suggest buying the bf4 premium edition for ps4 while it is on sale on psn."

I took one of the purchased games from Gamestop to Walmart and returned the game (for full retail price - $59.99), and instead of requesting a store credit I simply selected a different game that cost the same price in exchange.   It's like I received the second copy as a gift without a receipt. Even if the game is unavailable in the store I will almost guarantee the game can be found on the stores online site. If the game is in their database then the exchange is easy. The representative will process the return for store credit,and you can purchase whatever you want at the time.   Since I knew I wanted Far Cry 4 the Customer service member from electronics brought the new game to the returns section, and it was a simple one for one exchange instead of me being issued store credit."

PS4Deals,2qw0ws,popplenrookie,2,Wed Dec 31 14:15:12 2014 UTC,"Yes, silly me. ;P I read that and had a good chuckle."
PS4Deals,2qw0ws,Cokeb5,2,Wed Dec 31 16:24:14 2014 UTC,That's lame. I bought a voucher on ebay and the seller emailed me a screenshot lol
PS4Deals,2qw0ws,TupacHologram,1 point,Wed Dec 31 16:31:56 2014 UTC,Which is stupid considering eBay has it's own messaging system that can track emails.

PS4Deals,2qw0ws,oxymoron69,1 point,Wed Dec 31 21:32:55 2014 UTC,Dang that just ruins the deal. Thanks for the heads up!
PS4Deals,2qw0ws,Crazyanubis,1 point,Thu Jan 1 00:49:42 2015 UTC,"How the living hell can Ebay justify charging $17 to ship a PIECE OF PAPER to a neighbouring country? Rip off doesn't even begin to describe it. It's outrageous, theft almost. I ship actual games to the States all the time and it costs me UNDER FOUR DOLLARS. And there are no customs charges for something that cheap. So how eBay gets away with this is beyond me.  /rant"
PS4Deals,2qw0ws,DarkRaven47,2,Fri Jan 2 13:34:40 2015 UTC,Would this work for the UK?
PS4Deals,2qw0ws,iismatt,4,Wed Dec 31 07:06:46 2014 UTC,Bought the code earlier from another site. Living in The Netherlands with an US psn account it works.

PS4Deals,2qw0ws,rversed,1 point,Wed Dec 31 09:29:02 2014 UTC,"Yes, you can. I used 1 in 4 download code twice (for fc4 and destiny). Both times you need to redeem the code in that spl 1 in 4 page and select different game."
PS4Deals,2qw0ws,AIienreborn,1 point,Wed Dec 31 09:44:18 2014 UTC,I bought one of these from this seller last week and it worked gloriously.

PS4Deals,2qqnn6,tylery87,2,Mon Dec 29 20:33:19 2014 UTC,Correct. This is no tax and free shipping for someone who's ordering online and doesn't have GCU or just really wants the Day Zero DLC items.

(This may be why some people are getting 'undefined' codes...)  Hope this helps! :)  EDIT: I see now people are getting these errors on the proper redemption site, hopefully it gets fixed soon (also you should be able to re-enter your code later and retrieve the PSN code for the game you selected once the site is fixed [according to the site FAQ])."

I placed an order for two on Friday, and using my debit account, I got the paypal confirmation immediately. I went to my online banking, and there was nothing there.

PS4Deals,2qkd9p,theGalaxyBird,2,Mon Dec 29 16:57:42 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure, I managed to have mine cancelled. I remember the date on mine said it could take up to January 5th, but I would imagine it would only take two or three business days from when you made the purchase, so wednesday I would guess. The codes should get sent to you as soon as it goes through. The wait doesn't matter too much though because the redemption site for the code is still down."
PS4Deals,2qkd9p,ohhimark108,1 point,Mon Dec 29 17:07:07 2014 UTC,Mine came immediately. Like within 2-3 seconds.

PS4Deals,2qkd9p,Troll_Logic,3,Mon Dec 29 02:39:37 2014 UTC,Hey just an fyi. I was able to get my code and FC4 is downloading now.   I had to go here https://secure.us.playstation.com/dyn-bundle/ since they removed the get started button (still working on it I guess)

PS4Deals,2qkd9p,Obscene_cucumber,1 point,Mon Dec 29 04:39:54 2014 UTC,Do these codes expire? Would I be able to hold on to the code until the site is back up and get Far Cry 4 with no problems?

PS4Deals,2qkd9p,benbar21,1 point,Sun Dec 28 05:54:02 2014 UTC,I believe so. If it doesn't work just create a US PSN and redeem it there instead.  Edit: Scratch that. It works for Canada. I just started downloading mine.

This morning I've emailed both the gamedealdaily contact and the paypal e-mail the funds went to to see if I can get any info."
PS4Deals,2qkd9p,theGalaxyBird,2,Tue Dec 30 16:50:11 2014 UTC,"I was able to get a response by e-mailing help@gamedealdaily.com. They responded with a download code, but I haven't been able to try it because I'm not at home."
PS4Deals,2qkd9p,GhettoPastrami,2,Tue Dec 30 18:46:07 2014 UTC,"I got a response from him too! He asked if i had a different e-mail for my paypal account, and I told him it was, but that it forwards to the one I was e-mailing him from. No response yet.  Further, I was curious if there was an issue re: debit vs credit on paypal. So I added a CC to my paypal account and made another purchase. I didn't receive the code instantly, so my guess is that any issues people are having are more based on paypal account emails rather than debit vs. credit"

PS4Deals,2qkd9p,carrim12,1 point,Sun Dec 28 04:36:10 2014 UTC,So these codes don't work or where should they be redeemed?
PS4Deals,2qkd9p,ohhimark108,2,Sun Dec 28 04:43:30 2014 UTC,They work but when you try to redeem them on the website Playstation gives you an undefined code since PSN is acting weird.
PS4Deals,2qkd9p,carrim12,1 point,Sun Dec 28 04:53:56 2014 UTC,Thank you I guess I'll hold off. I saw on some other posts some of the codes say they've been used and the guy isn't very communicative.

PS4Deals,2qk4xj,illinivb7,3,Mon Dec 29 00:00:56 2014 UTC,Just explain it as your YMMV as it states in Best Buy's price match policy that the item must be available.
PS4Deals,2qk4xj,ooki1992,3,Sun Dec 28 00:03:39 2014 UTC,"Tried at both Best Buy and Walmart and it failed.  My phone is pretty old, so it didn't even load when I went to Walmart using their wifi.  Talk about bad luck."
PS4Deals,2qk4xj,Dat_Brown_Guy,2,Sun Dec 28 00:46:53 2014 UTC,I just got 2 controllers from Best Buy for 50 bucks. They were skeptical at first but eventually gave me the deal. Why didn't it work for you?
PS4Deals,2qk4xj,turk_turklton,4,Sun Dec 28 00:59:00 2014 UTC,"The mistake most people make is going to customer service or something instead of general check out line. Best Buys price match policy states that they will price match it as long as the product is currently in stock and NOT advertised as ""limited quantity"".   I've been turned away a few times for these reasons most of the time they don't care though."
PS4Deals,2qk4xj,verdi200,3,Sun Dec 28 01:15:51 2014 UTC,I just got denied because it was a special blowout sale and not a normal sale. The guy at Best Buy said Sears is doing away with their electronics so they couldn't match the price.
PS4Deals,2qk4xj,ooki1992,3,Sun Dec 28 01:33:47 2014 UTC,"At best buy, the general manager of the store opened up a new line and I had the pleasure of doing business with him instead of some regular cashier and I guess it didn't work out there."
PS4Deals,2qk4xj,jagr686610,3,Sun Dec 28 01:42:21 2014 UTC,Worked for me at Walmart on Xmas eve. The guys at the counter even said they were going to price match it for themselves because it was such a good deal.
PS4Deals,2qk4xj,IamsurroundedbyNs,3,Sun Dec 28 01:12:13 2014 UTC,"I got it PM'd at Best Buy yesterday. It helps to have it on your phone ready to go at checkout. Once I pulled that out, I had no problems."
PS4Deals,2qk4xj,lovewoagenda,3,Sun Dec 28 02:01:56 2014 UTC,It really depends on the employee. I got rejected because it was sold out in stores 50 mile radius before. Sometime no problem at all. I recommend just taking straight to checkout desk where cashiers have no idea about games.
PS4Deals,2qk4xj,mistakent,2,Sun Dec 28 02:50:20 2014 UTC,"Definitely YMMV since it has to be in stock at sears. Wasn't able to get it PM at best buy, but walmart PM'd (barely)"

PS4Deals,2qk4xj,euphrenaline,1 point,Sun Dec 28 05:53:25 2014 UTC,"Here is how I got this deal, just went up to the cashier, said I already talked to customer service and that they would price match, showed her the ad on my phone, no hassle what so ever.

PS4Deals,2qk4xj,Death_By_Art,1 point,Sun Dec 28 02:53:08 2014 UTC,There isn't an expiration date but I went to sears and the guy said sears is trying to liquidate its gaming department. Idk if its just my sears or all sears though but just to be on the safe side I would go to a BB or Walmart and have them PM asap
PS4Deals,2qk4xj,djkonflikt713,1 point,Sun Dec 28 06:20:00 2014 UTC,I also bought one at the best buy near my house the guy was extremely nice. He didn't question the color or anything (I bought a blue one.) he just rung me up as well as ringing up Dragon Age Inquisition. I am now a happy gamer.

PS4Deals,2qglnz,DonVerduras,2,Sat Dec 27 16:32:16 2014 UTC,I'm going to volunteer to be the guinea pig for this experiment. I'm going to buy it when I get home from work (about 2 hours) and will let you know what happens.

PS4Deals,2qgwet,djbeks,1 point,Sat Dec 27 02:25:42 2014 UTC,Does this still apply?
PS4Deals,2qgwet,BlitzKraig1,0,Tue Jan 6 02:24:23 2015 UTC,Not sure where my text went for this deal. Best buy has the above games for $39.99. Target will pricematch and then you get another 40%off for a total of $32 each. You can also do with other games/price matches but for less good of a deal. I did pm to amazon for FC4 for 48.88 with lbp3 for 40 for a total of 35 each pre tax. Enjoy and good luck!  Merry Christmas
PS4Deals,2qgwet,Cokeb5,5,Fri Dec 26 20:01:38 2014 UTC,"YMMV with this. Personally, all the local Targets around me won't price match and give you the 40% off."
PS4Deals,2qgwet,winterds001,3,Fri Dec 26 21:57:01 2014 UTC,"Correct, either price match or the cart wheel discount, some got away with using both."
PS4Deals,2qgwet,anusdotcom,1 point,Sat Dec 27 21:33:11 2014 UTC,Driveclub is not in the list of 40% off titles.
PS4Deals,2qgcte,sora1607,1 point,Fri Dec 26 16:28:37 2014 UTC,The hell... I just bought this for full price on Thanksgiving and now it's $20 off.....   Sigh
PS4Deals,2qgcte,rbace,2,Sat Dec 27 02:13:34 2014 UTC,wait till it goes cheap if you are uncomfortable with paying more.
PS4Deals,2qgcte,sora1607,2,Sat Dec 27 05:35:53 2014 UTC,"It's not about being uncomfortable with paying. If I was, I wouldnt have paid for it at that price. I'm not blaming anyone for it either, just merely talking about my own luck. Anyone would regret buying a game at full price just to see the price drop down by almost 50% a month later"
PS4Deals,2qgcte,Joecascio2000,-2,Sat Dec 27 05:43:03 2014 UTC,Word of advice: Don't talk about how unlucky you are because you paid more on reddit. People will shit on you for it.
PS4Deals,2qgcte,sora1607,4,Sat Dec 27 09:55:44 2014 UTC,"I dont see such a problem with complaining about an almost 50% price drop within a month. If it was after half a year or a year, i can understand. But point taken. Reddit can be sensitive"
PS4Deals,2qgcte,rbace,5,Sat Dec 27 10:42:57 2014 UTC,I always buy my games heavily discounted is the point. Being patient allows you to save a ton.
PS4Deals,2qgcte,sora1607,3,Sat Dec 27 11:24:07 2014 UTC,Certainly. But I was really looking forward to this game so I couldn't wait. There are things in life where you can and cannot wait :3
PS4Deals,2qgcte,JahWeir,1 point,Sun Dec 28 14:11:42 2014 UTC,Price matched at Walmart so I didn't have to wait on shipping.

PS4Deals,2qgcte,Emadicus,1 point,Sat Jan 3 00:21:04 2015 UTC,Is this a temporary deal or did the price just drop?
PS4Deals,2qgwba,DreadMcLaren,7,Fri Dec 26 19:53:22 2014 UTC,If it weren't for the lack of local multiplayer i would get this.

PS4Deals,2qgwba,Simerty,1 point,Sat Dec 27 04:31:04 2014 UTC,"Yea, but not very many. Go to Redbox's website and find a box near you and see what they have. If you rent one before January 1 it'll only cost you $2; after January 1 the price jumps to $3.   There are multiple Redboxes near me and I've rented a couple of games from them. It's nice because you can try out the game before you blow a bunch of money on it."

PS4Deals,2qfwom,12345games10,-13,Sat Dec 27 05:05:01 2014 UTC,"Guys, whatever you do, DO NOT. And, I repeat. DO NOT go to Walmart or Target to do price matching. You're essentially taking a gamble if you do. They have incompetent low class people working there including the managers who are unaware of policies and will just turn you away at the very thought of price matching. You give a beggar or a person with low class some type of authority, they will clench it with a sense of entitlement. It is basic socio economics and in part of inferiority complex. You are not guaranteed good service and you'll be accused of scamming them and pointed fingers at for being a con artist for just trying to score a good deal at the end of the day. I actually had to talk my way out of it from the authorities for just trying to shop. It's not even a deal of misunderstandings. That's just not how you provide service.  The best bet for anyone to do will be to go to Best Buy (even though they're not any better), pull up the link on your phone and they will happily price match it in the video game section. Just make sure you don't get a woman or someone of poor standards to ring it up for you or they'll just make a big issue out of it. It's not about white knighting misogyny, sexism, or feminism like how some elite Redditors will point the finger for. On top of all that, I am not any advocate or PR representative for Best Buy, but I am just basing it all on experience.  At the end of it all, you will leave with the store with a $60 game for $30. The worst case scenario will be $40 for in-store credit. Just something for everyone to consider when shopping."

PS4Deals,2qco8u,lalit008,3,Thu Dec 25 19:15:01 2014 UTC,Yes the soundtrack was horrible.
PS4Deals,2qco8u,koreanelvis420,2,Thu Dec 25 20:25:50 2014 UTC,Which you can replace thanks to usb music now.

PS4Deals,2qco8u,Kobeissi2,5,Sat Dec 27 09:26:46 2014 UTC,Already beaten but $20 seems right for this game. Anything else is too much for it
PS4Deals,2qco8u,coolgaara,3,Thu Dec 25 18:43:44 2014 UTC,You don't seem like one of those people who just rage at the meniton of the name. How is the game?
PS4Deals,2qco8u,unnithaan,7,Thu Dec 25 20:26:14 2014 UTC,"I really enjoy it. I got it I think 6 months back, but still play at least 1-2 hours everyday. The only other game I have spent so much time with is BF4. Just to give you an idea of the kind of games I like, I have Assassins Creed, Killzone and GTA5 in addition to the above two. I never played more than 10% of AC or KZ. GTA5 is ok, but I really can't get used to the driving. I enjoy WD's driving way more than GTA5s. Also, I spent 100% of my time in WD on online tailing. If I had listened to /r/PS4, I would have never bought WD and would have missed on all the fun I had until now."
PS4Deals,2qco8u,thatsupervillain,1 point,Fri Dec 26 02:00:21 2014 UTC,I much prefer the driving in WD. It's less realistic but it makes chases much more fun in my opinion. Nearly every fence and pole is destructible and sideswiping another car doesn't completely kill your momentum.
PS4Deals,2qco8u,unnithaan,-1,Tue Dec 30 08:54:12 2014 UTC,"Precisely this. I get down voted when I say this in comparison with GTA5. Even after 2-3 hours of GTA5, I hate it's driving. WD spoiled me."
PS4Deals,2qco8u,Kobeissi2,1 point,Wed Dec 31 00:15:09 2014 UTC,Story is pretty decent. Hacking was interesting for the first 5 minutes but got boring and tedious after that. Driving is horrible. It's entertaining but not really worth more than $20
PS4Deals,2qco8u,AzarinIsard,1 point,Fri Dec 26 00:25:58 2014 UTC,"My view is similar to yours, but I'd like to add that the game itself had so much promise. In fact, I was waiting to buy a PS4 for a while and the Watchdogs bundle is what tipped me over... I got Assassins Creed: Black Flag too, and both have made me lose faith in Ubisoft where once I used to eagerly pre-order all their games, I haven't even got Unity yet, I'll wait for it in the bargain bin. Their games used to be great fun throughout, but there's way too much focus on repetitive side quests / mini games / collection tasks which keep you busy without being interesting. Also, the drinking mini game is just awful, it made me feel sick playing it. After that, knowing full well I couldn't 100% it, I decided to screw most of the other objectives too and never went back to them.  Also, the ever present online stuff was turned off after the second time I was trying to start a campaign mission and it randomly decided that because I was 100 ft away from the start of the mission, obviously I wanted to be destroyed by someone who has completed the game, got better weapons, and knows WTF they want to be doing. Then after, I'm miles away from the campaign start so have to travel back. I never went back and turned it on later lol.  But, if you just do the main content and the hacking and so on, $20 is great value, just got to go into it prepared to find a lot of the extra content tedious/frustrating and then avoid them at all costs."

PS4Deals,2qb9j1,swotam,3,Sat Dec 27 04:31:56 2014 UTC,"I know right? These guys must be smoking the good stuff if they think that $45 for Watch Dogs is a sale, especially when pretty much every retailer has had it for much less over the past few weeks.   This is obviously intended to target the new PS4 owner who wants to buy from his couch and can't be bothered to check other sources first."

No, it's not a great game by any means, but it isn't particularly bad either.  I played the entire game and I enjoyed myself while playing it.  I thought the graphics were very neat, although not everyone will look them.  I don't understand the massive hate this game gets especially considering the size of the studio.  I think they made a valiant effort and come out with an enjoyable game.  No, it's not Dragon Age or Skyrim, but it does have some redeeming qualities."

Pretty good deal if you ask me."

When I ordered it at like 1am on the 25th the page still had it, but when they had my order ready to pickup when they opened on the 26th it wasn't there and no longer on the page. I knew I would probably lose that fight, and I just got 3 controllers price matched to $75 for all of them, so I decided not to press the issue on a headset I probably wouldn't use anyway lol."

PS4Deals,2q9vh6,discobiscuit4005,2,Sat Dec 27 06:54:02 2014 UTC,"Well, destiny might have the most replay value, but destiny and LBP are both on sale pretty often now. I think Far Cry is the one that I haven't seen on sale as often and I've heard that it's a pretty good game. And nba 2k15 is ok I guess? I really don't see much value in sports games that come out yearly."

Damnit   I have decided on getting one and was browsing earlier this evening looking for the best deal. I'm positive the page said $350 a couple hours ago when I first saw it.. wish I ordered one then

PS4Deals,2q9ak7,killy-mccooter,1 point,Fri Dec 26 05:37:13 2014 UTC,I found it on the Kmart app. I asked the for a price match at Walmart and showed them the prices at Kmart on the app and they did the match.
PS4Deals,2q9ak7,reyllo,1 point,Fri Dec 26 14:01:42 2014 UTC,Anyone know a zip code that has Fifa in stock. My local Walmart requires you to be able to add the game in cart.

PS4Deals,2q9gdt,Cokeb5,3,Wed Dec 24 08:11:19 2014 UTC,"I ordered mine as an in-store pickup on December 1st when Best Buy was doing the bundle for $419. Called the number at the bottom of my receipt, gave the rep my order number and in less than 5 minutes I had a credit for the difference.   This was after having to deal with Dawn at the customer service desk. She first tried telling me that I was out of the 15 day return policy. After I mentioned that they were in the ""holiday return policy"" she actually looked at my receipt. She then tells me she can't do anything for me since their ""systems"" were down. Fuckin' Dawn."

PS4Deals,2q9gdt,JLimSD,2,Thu Jan 1 09:59:08 2015 UTC,Wow. I really wish i waited.... I would return if u did get it from amazon. Don't wanna go thru with return.  Would have saved me 100 bucks.
PS4Deals,2q9gdt,coolgaara,5,Wed Dec 24 22:03:34 2014 UTC,I contacted Amazon about Best Buy's deal. I purchased it for $399.99 right around Black Friday so it's been less than 30 days. They refunded me 50 dollars as a one-time exception.
PS4Deals,2q9gdt,soondot,1 point,Wed Dec 24 23:12:02 2014 UTC,Did you get the destiny bundle at black friday or the GTAV/Last of Us one?
PS4Deals,2q9gdt,bonerpotpie,3,Thu Dec 25 05:10:16 2014 UTC,Destiny/White PS4 bundle.
PS4Deals,2q78tn,nochilinopity,15,Tue Dec 23 19:11:52 2014 UTC,Damn. Really wish GTA V for PS4 game got a deal too like the PS3.
PS4Deals,2q78tn,Garism,6,Tue Dec 23 19:28:54 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it's pretty lame that they didn't put the PS4 version on sale. I mean, who the hell cares about the PS3 version at this point? Pretty sure the vast majority who wanted it on that platform probably have it at this point."
PS4Deals,2q78tn,swotam,11,Tue Dec 23 20:12:12 2014 UTC,"Hence the sale, to attract the last few ps3 shoppers that where considering it. The PS4 version is selling like hotcakes at full price, no need for them to discount it."
PS4Deals,2q78tn,ricoza,1 point,Tue Dec 23 20:20:34 2014 UTC,"May I ask why? I bought it today for ps4 and i dont see that many differences from the ps3 version. Ofc there is the first person mode but i think driving in 3rd person is more fun and gunplay feels less gore'y and a bit strange. Maybe i need to play more, ive only played 3 hours so far."
PS4Deals,2q78tn,Ludachriz,2,Tue Dec 23 21:05:35 2014 UTC,"I played both and to me the PS4 version is way better. It's 1080P, with way better textures, lighting, solid frame rate, and better effects and 1st person mode is a great addition, IMO. You can check out one of the many comparison videos on YouTube for a basic comparison. I'm guessing you just remember it looking and performing better than it did, but I loved the PS3 version myself at the time, so there's nothing wrong with it, per se."
PS4Deals,2q78tn,livevil999,2,Tue Dec 23 21:10:45 2014 UTC,"IIRC, the new gen versions are the only ones to get the new Heist add ons coming out soon."
PS4Deals,2q78tn,djbeks,1 point,Thu Dec 25 17:26:29 2014 UTC,"Really? Lucky me then, i also kinda changed my mind. Ps4 version does feel different in a good way"
PS4Deals,2q78tn,Ludachriz,1 point,Thu Dec 25 18:11:10 2014 UTC,"I understand your point but to me it's just typical Sony. Put shit nobody wants on sale (GTAV has been on sale multiple times for PS3 already) and leave the stuff people might actually want at full price.  I wouldn't know how well the PS4 version is selling, but I suspect that whatever peak it had is probably dropping off by this point. Dropping the price by even $15 - $20 would likely result in an increase from people who already had the PS3 version who were on the fence about forking over another $60-$70 (depending on where in NA you are) for the remaster. I suspect a lot of previous owners are waiting around for a sale and won't consider buying until the price drops below $50."
PS4Deals,2q78tn,swotam,2,Tue Dec 23 20:35:57 2014 UTC,They only run sales In their best interest.
PS4Deals,2q78tn,rbace,3,Fri Dec 26 00:30:42 2014 UTC,when does this go live? the US store still has full price. Sorry if I'm a noob.. haha
PS4Deals,2q78tn,agentanthony,2,Tue Dec 23 20:17:45 2014 UTC,"The store updates in late afternoon / early evening depending on where you are in North America. It's been this way for years, don't expect to see the discounted prices until the store updates, and don't buy anything until then otherwise you'll pay regular price."

PS4Deals,2q78tn,agentanthony,2,Tue Dec 23 20:44:51 2014 UTC,Picked up BF4 Premium for $20 bucks. Used the$10 voucher I got with my PS4.
PS4Deals,2q78tn,venkman781,2,Thu Dec 25 07:33:06 2014 UTC,Pretty tempted by Alien: Isolation and Battlefield 4. Looks like they stepped up the deals a bit for the final week! :)
PS4Deals,2q78tn,Cokeb5,2,Tue Dec 23 19:18:48 2014 UTC,Wow.  Just bought BF4 for 26.97.  I would definitely buy it for $12.
PS4Deals,2q78tn,yanggmd,3,Tue Dec 23 19:53:16 2014 UTC,Same with me. Would definitely get the premium version on sale if I hadn't already purchased it.
PS4Deals,2q78tn,vince_93,2,Tue Dec 23 22:00:50 2014 UTC,Bf4 for $12 is amazing.     I just refuse to believe theres not going to be a flash sale this weekend though.....There is no freaking way with the hundreds of thousands of new players this week

PES was a great deal in EU. I'm pretty satisfied.

PS4Deals,2q78tn,joeboondok,1 point,Thu Dec 25 09:53:59 2014 UTC,"Alien Isolation is a solid deal, as is BF4 if you don't have it already.  GTAV being PS3 only is pathetic, they should have put the PS4 version on sale given that the PS3 version is 15 months old, but it's what you'd expect from Sony."
PS4Deals,2q78tn,thedaradotcom,5,Wed Dec 24 18:19:56 2014 UTC,How does Sony control the cost of other companies products? I'm pretty sure rockstar is behind the sale price and it being for PS3 only

PS4Deals,2q2s5i,PsychedelicKyle,3,Wed Dec 24 17:14:02 2014 UTC,I have price matched these deals at Best Buy (for a blue DS4) and Target (headset) both. It's unlikely you'll find these in a Sears at this point but price match is still working.
PS4Deals,2q2s5i,El_Specificbro,2,Mon Dec 22 15:55:43 2014 UTC,How can you price match? Just show them on your phone?
PS4Deals,2q2s5i,DumplingDragon,2,Mon Dec 22 18:14:41 2014 UTC,That's exactly what I did. Target insisted on double checking on their device. At Best Buy I recommend going to a regular cashier as the electronic sections cashiers seem to get annoyed with cheap ps4 stuff.
PS4Deals,2q2s5i,DumplingDragon,6,Mon Dec 22 18:18:55 2014 UTC,Why? It's not like it's their beloved store or anything o-o
PS4Deals,2q2s5i,lucad_kilerz,3,Mon Dec 22 19:16:54 2014 UTC,"Who knows, but they don't like it when you come in with a great deal. Maybe they feel like they're going to get in trouble for honoring it. When I picked up Gamer's Club Unlocked for $5 I had to deal with 2 different managers because the sales people just would not put it through no matter what the policy said."

PS4Deals,2q2s5i,Darx_Hood,1 point,Mon Dec 22 23:39:31 2014 UTC,They told me it only worked if they had it available in store at a Sears within some range. Wasn't able to get it price matched.
PS4Deals,2q2s5i,pogoblader,3,Sat Dec 27 05:25:40 2014 UTC,Got Walmart to price match at the second store I tried.  First store checked stock and said no since they were out.  Second store didn't check stock and I got a nice bonus Christmas gift for myself.  Cheers!
PS4Deals,2q2s5i,desirelife,3,Tue Dec 23 14:15:57 2014 UTC,Sears probably have very little of these in stock and  these other retailers are forced to match.  Sears reaping that sweet sweet karma.

She starting typing something on the computer I think to confirm and then it worked out without any questions whatsoever. If you have trouble, I think calling the 1-888-BESTBUY and telling them my local BestBuy is not price matching it even thought there were many other BestBuys that have pricematched including this phone number. Hopefully, it works out for you."

PS4Deals,2q2s5i,SamuraiSevens,2,Mon Dec 22 20:46:36 2014 UTC,You have to take the gamble and go to the store. Hope the cashier is too busy to scrutinize and just price matches it to get you out of the line. The phone customer service guys have probably already dealt with 20 people trying to get the deal and know that they are out of stock at all Sears locations and online.

PS4Deals,2q2s5i,Jgitch,1 point,Tue Dec 23 00:18:52 2014 UTC,"You may have to try both. I tried customer service first, didn't work. I tried the guy at Online PIkc Up, he did it for me. So you just have to get lucky man."
PS4Deals,2q2s5i,cynicaluser-,2,Tue Dec 23 00:26:13 2014 UTC,Thanks. I've never seen a Sears sale available in my area
PS4Deals,2q2s5i,RyanTcone,1 point,Tue Dec 23 00:28:35 2014 UTC,Customer Service.
PS4Deals,2q2s5i,Crummtastic,2,Tue Dec 23 00:29:27 2014 UTC,Just price matched at walmart for a white one. They didn't bat an eye! Thanks OP!
PS4Deals,2q2s5i,thai_mish,2,Tue Dec 23 21:55:23 2014 UTC,Just got mine from bestbuy.....I tried to get a blue one but that hoe wouldn't let me so I got the black but it's cool
PS4Deals,2q2s5i,trustmeiminnocent,2,Wed Dec 24 02:33:30 2014 UTC,Got mine at best buy for the Sears sale price. They were sold out of the black one so I got the white controller instead at the regular checkout. It was glorious.
PS4Deals,2q2s5i,mrh0169,2,Wed Dec 24 02:36:26 2014 UTC,Just called and Bestbuy told me they're not price matching anymore. Any suggestions? Really looking to buy a white one.
PS4Deals,2q2s5i,trustmeiminnocent,2,Wed Dec 24 02:45:37 2014 UTC,Think if I take this to a best buy they'll price match for me? I'm in Canada -___-;
PS4Deals,2q2s5i,coolgaara,1 point,Mon Dec 22 22:50:01 2014 UTC,They didn't when I tried. Has to be Canadian when you're matching.  . Sears.ca or whatever
PS4Deals,2q2s5i,DirtyMuffin-,1 point,Tue Dec 23 13:25:38 2014 UTC,price matching is awesome. Thanks OP.
PS4Deals,2q2s5i,lakerswiz,1 point,Mon Dec 22 18:05:04 2014 UTC,"Got one. Went to two walmarts, they wouldn't honor it. Best Buy gave me trouble too but I went to the front, showed them the sears price no issues!"
PS4Deals,2q2s5i,-Arvin,1 point,Mon Dec 22 21:26:11 2014 UTC,"I just picked up one today as well, from Walmart...I showed my phone to the cashier and they matched it no questions asked."
PS4Deals,2q2s5i,BigManBuddha,1 point,Tue Dec 23 21:18:14 2014 UTC,I went straight to the entertainment both times at Walmart section could be why. Guess each walmart is different. And entertainment gives you a huge hassle for uber cheap deals.
PS4Deals,2q2s5i,Gumball_Machine,1 point,Wed Dec 24 04:10:14 2014 UTC,"I went to BestBuy. The lady I asked at Customer Service said Sears is not part of their price match retailers. Now I know this wasn't true and asked the guy at the Online Pick-Up while picking up my Gamers Club Card. He tried to look it up on his tablet but didn't show up, seems like it was only on mobile version. But he took it no problem and got it for $27 w/ tax."
PS4Deals,2q2s5i,somehighdude,1 point,Tue Dec 23 00:25:06 2014 UTC,Tried it at Target and the cashier asked for the actual ad (paper). I ended up paying full price.
PS4Deals,2q2s5i,Warforged4,1 point,Tue Dec 23 02:18:30 2014 UTC,"Got two at Best Buy, but they wouldn't let me get the other colors. Only black. I'll try to swap them for other colors in a week or so I think."
PS4Deals,2q2s5i,DumplingDragon,0,Tue Dec 23 03:58:24 2014 UTC,how would you switch the colors?
PS4Deals,2q3c2p,Tom29193,2,Mon Dec 22 18:47:37 2014 UTC,Currently $59.99 on Target.com if anyone was wondering.
PS4Deals,2q3c2p,tjb1,1 point,Mon Dec 22 21:33:40 2014 UTC,Is it worth picking up at this price?
PS4Deals,2q3c2p,kilroyishere89,4,Mon Dec 22 21:52:04 2014 UTC,"Honestly, no. The game is fun for a while but I don't think it's work $30. If it gets down to $20 then go ahead."
PS4Deals,2q3c2p,zlos18,1 point,Mon Dec 22 22:17:14 2014 UTC,I bought it at $25. Big mistake. Don't buy it.
PS4Deals,2q3c2p,af27,1 point,Mon Dec 22 23:47:33 2014 UTC,"If you are still interested, GameStop has it for $20 this week."
PS4Deals,2q3c2p,SymphonicRain,1 point,Mon Dec 29 03:37:47 2014 UTC,I bought it on Black Friday for $30.  I enjoyed the game.  Worth it.  Would not pay full price though.
PS4Deals,2q3c2p,cats05,1 point,Tue Dec 23 02:46:21 2014 UTC,My local game store sells it for $20. So I will pass
PS4Deals,2q3c2p,PaulPierceWiz4Life,1 point,Tue Dec 23 17:15:10 2014 UTC,which store ?
PS4Deals,2q3c2p,winterds001,1 point,Wed Dec 24 04:17:15 2014 UTC,You can get it for $20 at Best Buy right now
PS4Deals,2q3c2p,no_joe,1 point,Fri Dec 26 15:20:16 2014 UTC,Says $60 online
PS4Deals,2q3c2p,winterds001,1 point,Fri Dec 26 20:29:41 2014 UTC,Amazon is selling it online for $20 and Best Buy will match that price.
PS4Deals,2q3c2p,no_joe,1 point,Fri Dec 26 22:32:46 2014 UTC,"yeah i got it for $20, i went to another target and tried to use the cartwheel with the price match and they wouldn't let me hehe"
PS4Deals,2q3c2p,winterds001,1 point,Fri Dec 26 22:54:00 2014 UTC,I was able to get them to pricematch amazon and use cartwheel coupon to get it for $10. My friend in another city did the same thing. Just depends on who's ringing you up for sure.
PS4Deals,2q3c2p,astanix,1 point,Sun Dec 28 17:22:35 2014 UTC,basically yeah. The older cashiers it seems won't help out =p
PS4Deals,2q0osp,Golden_Taint,6,Mon Dec 22 00:21:58 2014 UTC,"Pro tip: if you buy the GCU card in-store or buy it online and pick up in-store, make sure to have the cashier activate your membership. They need to scan a second barcode on the card and link it to an existing MyBestBuy/RewardsZone account."
PS4Deals,2q0osp,venkman781,2,Mon Dec 22 04:35:54 2014 UTC,"Even if you buy it in store, still make sure they do this. I'm a little pissed I have to make another trip to Bestbuy after being asked if it was for me."
PS4Deals,2q0osp,Joecascio2000,1 point,Mon Dec 22 06:13:05 2014 UTC,"Ditto. Only saw this thread when I got home from BB. Called the local store and the cashier didn't activate it, so I have to go back now.   Oh well. I have a game to pick up that I price matched last week and had them ship to the store, so I had to go anyways."
PS4Deals,2q0osp,kilroyishere89,1 point,Mon Dec 22 19:59:12 2014 UTC,Pay attention to this. I ended up having to go back to get it activated on my account.
PS4Deals,2q0osp,Cokeb5,1 point,Mon Dec 22 07:26:28 2014 UTC,"Yup, me too. I have to go back to get my card linked. Wish I had paid better attention to the instructions."
PS4Deals,2q0osp,venkman781,1 point,Mon Dec 22 13:31:27 2014 UTC,I'm pretty sure you can do it on their website too. That's what the cashier told me at least.
PS4Deals,2q0osp,AngrySandyVag,1 point,Mon Dec 22 16:35:07 2014 UTC,"It turns out there's two different types of GCU cards that are in the store. One of them is meant for a gift, and that one must be activated by a cashier AND added to your account by a cashier. The other one I believe you can add to your account yourself."
PS4Deals,2q0osp,Cokeb5,1 point,Mon Dec 22 17:52:47 2014 UTC,"Oh, well shit that sucks for my friend. Looks like I bought him a GCU card and a trip to the mall. I guess I'll throw some gas money in there? haha"
PS4Deals,2q0osp,AngrySandyVag,1 point,Mon Dec 22 18:08:48 2014 UTC,I looked all over their site for where to activate it. Couldn't find it anywhere.
PS4Deals,2q0osp,kilroyishere89,1 point,Mon Dec 22 20:00:41 2014 UTC,"I had an ordeal with this last night. Turns out there are two different GCU cards they offer. One of them is a ""gift card"" GCU with two bar codes. One of them gets scanned when you buy it and then other one gets scanned by whoever it's given to link to their My Rewards card.   The other card only has one bar code. Everyone should look to buy that one. It is the card that does not have boxes of presents on it. I had to deal with a cashier that scanned both bar codes of the gift GCU card without ever linking to My Rewards membership."
PS4Deals,2q0osp,Houston_Centerra,1 point,Mon Dec 22 16:11:21 2014 UTC,"So I can just make a MyBestBuy account online and that will suffice? If so, is just my email enough to sign up when I got?  Edit: Or phone number I guess, since it asks for that when you sign up."
PS4Deals,2q0osp,Kami_no_Kage,1 point,Tue Dec 23 22:25:23 2014 UTC,"Yes, if you have setup a MyBestBuy account already, the cashier should be able to link the GCU to it using an email or phone number."
PS4Deals,2q0osp,venkman781,1 point,Tue Dec 23 23:02:09 2014 UTC,"Awesome, thanks."
PS4Deals,2q0osp,Kami_no_Kage,2,Tue Dec 23 23:03:04 2014 UTC,"Continued thanks to you for running and updating his sub.  Your deals have saved me about $90 just this month alone! (I got Destiny for half price, and now this Gamer Club deal)."
PS4Deals,2q0osp,Arcades,2,Tue Dec 23 02:01:02 2014 UTC,This deal is still going on till January 3. its in the weekly ad from bestbuy (http://deals.bestbuy.com/?category=video+games2)
PS4Deals,2q0osp,-Arvin,1 point,Thu Dec 25 23:24:37 2014 UTC,Still going on.  Just picked it up.  Thanks.
PS4Deals,2q0osp,SpartyOnMSU,1 point,Fri Dec 26 11:26:34 2014 UTC,Yep! Just got it now as well!
PS4Deals,2q0osp,GGKoul,2,Fri Dec 26 17:59:49 2014 UTC,"If you dont have it,  get one,  its worth it. Basically all new games are $48.99. Plus the $10 pre order bonus is awesome.  I ended up picking up forza horizon 2 for $23 because of gcu. Was on sale for $39.99, got my 20% discount on top of that, then had a $10 voucher from a pre-order. $30 for 2 yrs of 20% off... Wellllllllllll worth it."
PS4Deals,2q0osp,Gooeygoetta,1 point,Mon Dec 22 12:30:54 2014 UTC,Just got back from Best Buy about 30 minutes ago with mine. It's a hell of a deal! Love this sub!
PS4Deals,2q0osp,Cokeb5,1 point,Mon Dec 22 00:26:08 2014 UTC,Looked into the Gamers Club unlocked.. Though I see nowhere that the price is 30 dollars. Also is it 30 dollars for a year or two years?
PS4Deals,2q0osp,imitalian,2,Mon Dec 22 03:56:20 2014 UTC,Here's a link for the item showing priced at $30 online.
PS4Deals,2q0osp,Cokeb5,2,Mon Dec 22 04:12:03 2014 UTC,Check the local ads for best buy. It will be listed. And make sure they dont charge you $99 for it. I had to show them the ad to get it for $30 because it seems no one at Best buy has a clue about it.
PS4Deals,2q0osp,Gooeygoetta,1 point,Mon Dec 22 12:32:50 2014 UTC,"For 2 years. Usually $99, $30 for the next few days. There's another post about it on the front page of this sub."
PS4Deals,2q0osp,jasuess,1 point,Mon Dec 22 04:08:49 2014 UTC,It was in the print ad AFAIK. Just got back from a Minnesota BBY and got it for $30 and it took $8 off COD:AW in the same purchase. Also price matched a DS4 to the Sears $25. I would have price matched Infamous to the Kmart $15 as well but they were out of stock.  The subscription is for 2 years.
PS4Deals,2q0osp,FancyJesse,1 point,Mon Dec 22 04:10:20 2014 UTC,Any benefits involving shipping?
PS4Deals,2q0osp,kilroyishere89,2,Mon Dec 22 15:33:59 2014 UTC,"Not with the GCU, but with the regular My Rewards membership you get free shipping when you spend $35 or more."
PS4Deals,2q0osp,chandleross,1 point,Mon Dec 22 20:02:15 2014 UTC,"Does it work for 2 years from the date of purchase?  Can I use it, for example, for 2016-2018 if I wanted it to start later?"
PS4Deals,2q0osp,imitalian,2,Mon Dec 22 22:30:35 2014 UTC,"Starts from date of purchase, unless you already have a GCU membership in which case it extends you two more years."
PS4Deals,2pzooe,spiningthelock,2,Sun Dec 21 18:39:10 2014 UTC,Will these stack on top each other? If i buy 3 cards would i be good for 3 years?
PS4Deals,2pzooe,Hungryforpegging,4,Sun Dec 21 19:06:23 2014 UTC,I think one card is good for 2 years. If they stack itd be six years.
PS4Deals,2pzooe,Danimaltanimal,1 point,Sun Dec 21 19:13:31 2014 UTC,They will stack if you really want more than two years right now.
PS4Deals,2pzooe,Golden_Taint,1 point,Sun Dec 21 22:42:20 2014 UTC,"They state when you go to buy the cards online that they have to be redeemed by a certain date. I am unsure if you can activate multiple at a time   Purchasing the Membership Activation Card does not enroll the recipient into the program.  To begin receiving benefits, the recipient must personally bring the Membership Activation Card to a Best Buy store to enroll (not valid online) by the expiration date printed on the card.  The Membership Activation Card may be purchased as a gift for someone else, but the recipient must meet the eligibility requirements and enroll in a Best Buy store as described above."
PS4Deals,2pzooe,Lottimer,1 point,Wed Dec 24 03:41:37 2014 UTC,"I don't know if they do, but 3 would give you 6 years. The membership lasts two years."
PS4Deals,2pzooe,AngrySandyVag,1 point,Sun Dec 21 19:13:48 2014 UTC,"Thanks, I'm dumb, just realized they're two year cards"
PS4Deals,2pzooe,Hungryforpegging,2,Sun Dec 21 19:32:16 2014 UTC,So I bought one. But there's like no place to tell if you're actually a member. Unless you go to the store and buy something... I might be dumb.  Edit: It's not like XBL Gold or PS+ where it says you're a gold or + member.  It just applies a discount to certain games when you buy online.  In store you just have to give your email/rewardscard
PS4Deals,2pzooe,xdonoflondonx,2,Sun Dec 21 19:50:20 2014 UTC,"After you log in at the website, you should see 20% come off game prices when you add to cart."
PS4Deals,2pzooe,Golden_Taint,1 point,Sun Dec 21 22:43:20 2014 UTC,It doesn't show it when you go to My Best Buy?
PS4Deals,2pzooe,LazyassedNinja,1 point,Sun Dec 21 20:14:46 2014 UTC,"It took me a moment to find, but if you go to your account page and click ""See All"" under ""My Benefits"" it shows you your GCU expiration date."
PS4Deals,2pzooe,delti90,2,Mon Dec 22 18:20:15 2014 UTC,Can you double check this? There isn't a 'See All' under My Benefits. I see the 'See All' under My Exclusive Offer
PS4Deals,2pzooe,J0hnnyArs0n,1 point,Mon Dec 22 20:37:29 2014 UTC,"Oh, sorry it's ""Learn More"" Then scroll up and it's under Rewards."

PS4Deals,2pzooe,J0hnnyArs0n,2,Mon Dec 22 23:24:31 2014 UTC,"Weird, mine has a date on it :|"
PS4Deals,2pzooe,delti90,2,Mon Dec 22 23:26:54 2014 UTC,"Appreciate your help. I guess as long as I have it, I'm good."
PS4Deals,2pzooe,J0hnnyArs0n,1 point,Mon Dec 22 23:52:07 2014 UTC,"bought mine yesterday in store, got a email confirmation this morning."
PS4Deals,2pzooe,rabblerabble8,2,Mon Dec 22 20:44:05 2014 UTC,"Got mine today at a local BB. Cashier told me it was activated, so I went back over and picked up COD:AW for $39.99. Cashier had to manually take the 20% off. I think the first cashier just rang up the sale and didn't activate/redeem the membership."
PS4Deals,2pzooe,venkman781,1 point,Sun Dec 21 21:31:15 2014 UTC,"Mine was glitchy the first day. You have a record of buying it in your account, worst case is they have to fix it in a couple days if it's still not registering correctly."
PS4Deals,2pzooe,Golden_Taint,1 point,Sun Dec 21 22:47:56 2014 UTC,I'm still having trouble with it to this day (bought it during the last deal in November). If it's a gifting card you might need to have the second bar code scanned at the beginning of your next BB transaction for it to process fully.
PS4Deals,2pzooe,Urtedrage,1 point,Mon Dec 22 03:04:03 2014 UTC,Methinks you're both right. I've got the GCU card and the receipt for it. I'll take it in to the customer service desk and have them activate it.
PS4Deals,2pzooe,venkman781,2,Mon Dec 22 04:14:27 2014 UTC,"So its like what, a week or so until New Years? Could I like buy 3 games now and it'll start again anew after Jan 1st? Lol I'm guessing not."
PS4Deals,2pzooe,xdonoflondonx,5,Sun Dec 21 23:22:45 2014 UTC,"In case you missed the correction, you are not limited to three games with your discount, you get the 20% on all new games you buy for two years. The only limit is three copies per title per platform. So you can't buy more than 3 copies of any given game for a given console."
PS4Deals,2pzooe,Golden_Taint,1 point,Mon Dec 22 00:05:13 2014 UTC,nice to see we can get these online after all.
PS4Deals,2pzooe,indrv,1 point,Sun Dec 21 20:20:16 2014 UTC,I'm confused. It says 'available in store only' yet it gives you the option to ship to your house. Is this a glitch or will it still work?
PS4Deals,2pzooe,indrv,1 point,Sun Dec 21 21:17:10 2014 UTC,"It's usually in store only to get signed up. This is new, I'm assuming they wouldn't list it if you can buy it online. Maybe worth calling customer service about (1-888-BESTBUY)."
PS4Deals,2pzooe,Golden_Taint,1 point,Sun Dec 21 22:46:46 2014 UTC,My question is this: is this really worth it...Amazon often times has new games going for 20% off. sometimes more.
PS4Deals,2pzooe,adogg1150,1 point,Mon Dec 22 02:34:47 2014 UTC,"It has been for me. You get brand new games for 20 percent off, plus if you pre ordered, you get an extra $10 credit.   The 20 percent is placed on top of any deals they are having. Their last ""buy 2 get one"" deal, I got 3 $60 games for about $90."
PS4Deals,2pzooe,BeachratMEsteed,1 point,Mon Dec 22 05:49:02 2014 UTC,"Your experience may differ, but I bought one of these a month ago. Every time I go into Best Buy they are unable to find my membership, every time I have to explain how I bought it and show them the card+receipt, and every time they end up just manually processing the discount.  For the love of all you hold holy, get the non-gifting version of this membership and save yourself a tremendous headache!"
PS4Deals,2pzooe,Urtedrage,0,Mon Dec 22 03:02:06 2014 UTC,"If I go to bestbuy and get a game and price match it, will the 20% apply too?"
PS4Deals,2pzooe,lucad_kilerz,5,Sun Dec 21 21:06:17 2014 UTC,"No, actually. The 20% does not stack on price matches."
PS4Deals,2pzooe,Golden_Taint,0,Sun Dec 21 22:41:36 2014 UTC,I was reading the FAQ about the membership. The thing that bothers me most is only allowing to buy 3 games per year using 20% discount.
PS4Deals,2pzooe,TazzM90,5,Sun Dec 21 22:48:34 2014 UTC,"I see how you're confused, but what they're saying is that you may only buy 3 copies of the SAME game per year. This means you can only buy 3 copies of Advanced Warfare for the PS4 in a year, for example. You can buy 100's of games with the membership, just not the same game more than 3 times. Hope that clears things up!"
PS4Deals,2pzooe,Cokeb5,2,Sun Dec 21 23:43:01 2014 UTC,"Correct. You can buy up to 3 copies of each title per platform. So you could buy three copies of Destiny for PS4, three copies of Destiny for Xbox One, etc."
PS4Deals,2pzooe,Golden_Taint,1 point,Mon Dec 22 00:02:02 2014 UTC,Yes it does! Thanks!
PS4Deals,2pzooe,TazzM90,5,Mon Dec 22 04:22:11 2014 UTC,"3 of the same title.   For friends, obviously."
PS4Deals,2pzooe,ShoeSh1ne,2,Sun Dec 21 23:44:47 2014 UTC,"As /u/Cokeb5 already stated, you read the FAQ wrong. You can buy up to three copies of each title per platform. Other than that, there's no limit to the amount of games you can buy with it over the next two years."
PS4Deals,2pzooe,Golden_Taint,0,Mon Dec 22 00:03:58 2014 UTC,"How can you the gamers club? I went to best buy to get one and they said I had to be a member. I registered and went back, but they need a card number to put the membership. Where do you get the card?"
PS4Deals,2pzooe,japorma,1 point,Sun Dec 21 20:58:26 2014 UTC,"You don't need an actual card, I don't have one at all. You just need a standard Best Buy rewards membership, I just give my phone number in store and it pulls up. If they can do that with you, you're good to go."
PS4Deals,2pzooe,Golden_Taint,0,Sun Dec 21 22:45:29 2014 UTC,/u/Golden_Taint there's some people here with question I know you can answer.
PS4Deals,2pzooe,GoiterGlitter,1 point,Sun Dec 21 22:28:25 2014 UTC,does this rewards work on vouchers bought for digital copies of the game?
PS4Deals,2pzooe,architta,1 point,Mon Dec 22 03:15:53 2014 UTC,"/u/golden_taint will know.   Give him a minute, he's cooking."

PS4Deals,2pzooe,Golden_Taint,1 point,Mon Dec 22 03:21:48 2014 UTC,aww :( not worth it for me then.  But thank you! :)
PS4Deals,2pzooe,architta,1 point,Mon Dec 22 03:26:27 2014 UTC,"It's all good, I understand the ease of all-digital especially if money's not really an issue. I went all digital with my old Xbox 360, it's super convenient. Right now, it's just not worth it to me to pay the extra 20% to do it."
PS4Deals,2pzooe,Golden_Taint,1 point,Mon Dec 22 04:19:25 2014 UTC,"Actually for me its a different reason. I have two PS4s, my brother uses the PS4 that is designated as the primary. So its really great to be able to play the games we buy together without needing two copies, like GTA and such."
PS4Deals,2pzooe,architta,-3,Mon Dec 22 21:19:21 2014 UTC,"i've heard from a few people that these things sound great, but are actually horrible. apparently in-store people have pretty much no idea what they are. you have to get ahold of a manager and argue your way to the 20% discount every single time.  if it worked the way it claims to, this would be worth it. but i don't think it does."

PS4Deals,2pyupb,Cshack30,2,Mon Dec 22 16:47:47 2014 UTC,It shows out of stock online.   $329 still valid for in store pickup.
PS4Deals,2pyupb,40ozBounce,1 point,Mon Dec 22 17:09:11 2014 UTC,I don't see that on the Walmart app. Do I have to do something special?
PS4Deals,2pyupb,kochidon,1 point,Tue Dec 23 07:04:22 2014 UTC,I had to scroll down past several items before seeing it.   There was one listed for $399 which made me think it was no longer on sale but it was just Tiger Direct selling on Walmart's marketplace.
PS4Deals,2pyiiq,huff610,5,Sun Dec 21 07:51:08 2014 UTC,best buy price matched it for me.
PS4Deals,2pyiiq,winterds001,4,Sun Dec 21 22:33:49 2014 UTC,Best Buy would have price matched for me as well but they were out of stock. I was successful price matching at Walmart but the guy there was kind of a jerk.
PS4Deals,2pyiiq,jasuess,1 point,Mon Dec 22 04:16:09 2014 UTC,so walmart did it even tho it was sold out?
PS4Deals,2pyiiq,blobbydigital,3,Tue Dec 23 01:58:55 2014 UTC,Best Buy was sold out. Walmart wasn't. I price matched successfully at Walmart but the clerk there (at Walmart) was a jerk.
PS4Deals,2pyiiq,jasuess,3,Tue Dec 23 05:12:47 2014 UTC,"Not having price matched before, how does this work? Do they have to load up the Kmart website? Or can you just load it up on your phone?"
PS4Deals,2pyiiq,zwickarrb,2,Wed Dec 24 17:17:33 2014 UTC,"just either show them the item on your phone or tell them where to go, they usually look it up themselves on their computers."
PS4Deals,2pyiiq,winterds001,2,Thu Dec 25 21:53:27 2014 UTC,"So I checked bestbuy.com to make sure the game was in stock before I go. Check Kmart.com to make sure it's still in stock (it is) so I goto bestbuy and cannot find the game. I ask a clerk, he says they have 3 of them in stock. He checks the whole store and only finds a pre-owned one (just a disk) and guess what, they don't price match pre owned games! Damn u Best Buy!"
PS4Deals,2pyiiq,zwickarrb,2,Sat Dec 27 20:51:08 2014 UTC,"Damn that sucks, go to another best buy ? :)"
PS4Deals,2pyiiq,winterds001,2,Sat Dec 27 21:27:44 2014 UTC,"So went to another Best Buy that said they didn't have it in stock thinking ""if one store says they do have it in stock on their website, then I should goto a store that I'm told doesn't have stock!"" So I did. And behold, they had it! Showed them the Kmart sale on my phone, she glanced at at and I got it for $15, new!   Even my wife who was with me who is not into games at all was impressed with the savings!   Thanks!"
PS4Deals,2pyiiq,zwickarrb,5,Tue Dec 30 05:02:33 2014 UTC,"People forget to mention this important policy. Both walmart and BestBuy say the item must be in stock at the time of request. I was refused twice by BB because of this. just checked policy for Walmart. Or either the cashiers don't care and get lucky like most people seem to be.  Edit: Went to Target. My cashier did it no problem, just called supervisor since he didn't have authorization to lower the price more than $10 or something. I may go to Target for price match from now on. Screw my local BestBuy."
PS4Deals,2pyiiq,coolgaara,4,Mon Dec 22 00:19:06 2014 UTC,"The people at Walmart (330pm) cared for me at least.  The guy at Best Buy(8pm) was cool though so yeah I guess luck, cashier/time of day has some effect."
PS4Deals,2pyiiq,xdonoflondonx,3,Mon Dec 22 01:32:24 2014 UTC,Glad it worked out for you! Enjoy your game!
PS4Deals,2pyiiq,sokkerfrenzy,3,Mon Dec 22 02:50:34 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I think it depends on the Walmart. I went over there and when I asked for a price-match, the guy working there told me that the Kmart had to have at least one copy ""in-stock"".  The Kmart in town didn't have any in stock, but he told to look up ""any zip code - I just need to see that it's in stock somewhere. Tried a few random zip codes, found a Kmart that had 2 left in stock, and he was able to get me the price-match."

PS4Deals,2pyiiq,kilroyishere89,4,Mon Dec 22 05:40:35 2014 UTC,"It seems like YMMV as far as price matching Best Buy goes.   This is what I did when I price matched Metal Gear Solid 5 at Best Buy using kmart.com(it was $4.99 a few days ago):   Find inFamous on Best Buy's website.   http://www.bestbuy.com/site/infamous-second-son-playstation-4/8677151.p?id=1218884649576&skuId=867715   At that link you'll see the price is $39.99. Above the price it says 'price match guarantee'. Hover over that and a box should come up with a phone number. Call that number and tell whomever amswers that you want to price match with kmart.com(I think you still have to have a physical KMart as a ""local competitor"").  I was asked for the SKU number, which is on the listing. Then they will ask where you found the lower price. Tell them where and they will put you on hold to go look it up.  T lady I talked to tried to argue it was a digital copy because the word 'digital' was in the name of the publisher on the kmart.com listing. I countered and she said OK to the price match.  I paid over the phone and am having it delivered to my local Best Buy.    Good luck."
PS4Deals,2pyiiq,mistakent,2,Mon Dec 22 13:59:35 2014 UTC,Thanks! Will try calling   Edit: The rep said Kmart needs to have it in stock :[
PS4Deals,2pyiiq,coolgaara,2,Mon Dec 22 21:51:03 2014 UTC,You just have to get lucky. All these people say different things. You just have to get lucky and hope that cashier doesn't really care much. This guy at Electronics at Target did it no problem. NO hassle whatsoever.
PS4Deals,2pyiiq,merph_,3,Tue Dec 23 00:27:41 2014 UTC,Successfully price matched this at Target last night.  Their regular price was $44.99.

PS4Deals,2pyiiq,xdonoflondonx,2,Sat Dec 27 02:47:10 2014 UTC,Just tried. You have to able to add it to your cart (from kmart) in order for the deal to go through for Wally.  Edit: Bought it from Best Buy no hassle gg no re.

PS4Deals,2py5rw,Sexy_Young_Man,1 point,Sun Dec 21 22:06:30 2014 UTC,"This website worked for me. I purchased the pick 1 of 4 and also the far cry 4 individual.   Both codes had me enter them at the following website  http://www.playstation.com/en-us/inside-playstation/events/2014/ps4-4games1pick/  Both codes gave me the option to pick 1 of 4 games, all the same as advertised on the link.   I paid 37.49 for each code. But I am seriously now wondering if I had picked the LBP3 full game download from the website, currently $32.49, if I would have received the same codes to be able to pick 1 of 4 games but at a cheaper cost.   Either way this website works, these are free voucher codes that are being sold 100% profit to the seller. Can't beat the price though. Thanks for the link."

PS4Deals,2psw3c,ColinZealSE,2,Fri Dec 19 17:49:40 2014 UTC,"Could there be any legitimacy issues buying games like this ? It just seems like there are guys ripping off the codes from PS4 bundles. I bought and my paypal recipient had some guys name, not a legit company.  Will there be a bunch of PS4 bundles out there with a non-working free game code now, or did they find an exploit to sell legit codes?"

The actual sale was ""Save $30 when you buy BOTH a PS4 camera AND Just Dance 2015 for PS4"" A corrected sign was supposed to have been printed and hung, but this store apparently hadn't done so yet. However, if you walk into a TRU and the original sign is still hanging, they will honor it, as is store policy. Hope this clears thing up a bit about certain locations not having this same sale."

PS4Deals,2pmgh9,Golden_Taint,6,Wed Dec 17 22:51:33 2014 UTC,I haven't seen a actual Sears store with games in it since the early 90s and even then theye were on a 5ft shelf.   So the best bet is hoping for a price match on items since most deals are even out of stock for online orders.   Tried to get the $7 killzone deal but they said it was a glitch and nobody would honor it :(
PS4Deals,2pmgh9,dfrazier81,3,Wed Dec 17 23:15:02 2014 UTC,It'll be tough to find those prices in print

PS4Deals,2plbfx,Sgt_ZigZag,7,Wed Dec 17 17:13:40 2014 UTC,Does anyone know if you can pricematch a game and then get the 20 percent off on top of that?
PS4Deals,2plbfx,Lanternrag,7,Wed Dec 17 19:20:26 2014 UTC,"No, you can't combine them. BUT the 20% stacks with any sale price they're offering. So brand new games that sell for $59.99, you get them for $47.99. Games on sale for $49.99, you get for $39.99. So on and so on. Plus, they offer $10 rewards back on a big chunk of new games when you pre-order. For example, I pre-ordered GTAV, payed $47.99 and got $10 back.  Also remember that if you buy it on this promo, you'll have the membership for Black Friday 2015 and 2016, that's huge.  All of us GCU members cleaned up on BF, the prices were already killer but we still got them cheaper. Between that and the 10% bonus on trades, it's pretty killer."
PS4Deals,2plbfx,Golden_Taint,4,Wed Dec 17 19:56:00 2014 UTC,woah that pre-order thing sounds legit. I think I'm sold.
PS4Deals,2plbfx,indrv,3,Wed Dec 17 23:02:39 2014 UTC,You get store credit for every 250 spent too. I buy my friends games too so I get to 250 pretty quick. You can buy up to 3 of the same game with the 20% discount so take advantage of it. Your friends get cheaper games and you get points!
PS4Deals,2plbfx,Nick51705,1 point,Thu Dec 18 03:55:10 2014 UTC,"Actually, GCU members get double points, so $5 for each $125 spent. :)"
PS4Deals,2plbfx,Golden_Taint,2,Thu Dec 18 20:56:16 2014 UTC,"Here's the current list of games that qualify for the $10 bonus, just FYI. You just have to pre-order the game up to the day before release to qualify for the rewards."
PS4Deals,2plbfx,Golden_Taint,1 point,Thu Dec 18 20:58:35 2014 UTC,"Nice man thanks for the list! I'm pretty dissapointed Bloodborne is not on here :/ hopefully they'll add it as the release approaches.

PS4Deals,2plbfx,digitalgoodtime,3,Wed Dec 17 20:48:18 2014 UTC,I would like to stack them as well.  Got mine at the end of October and would like to have it extended to cover Black Friday 2016 if possible.
PS4Deals,2plbfx,SenorV,2,Wed Dec 17 20:24:20 2014 UTC,"Yes, you can absolutely stack. You might want to hold off since your membership is fresh, you never know what deals might be available over that time. For example, my membership only cost me $15, others got it last month for under $10."
PS4Deals,2plbfx,Golden_Taint,6,Wed Dec 17 22:13:42 2014 UTC,"Just to be clear, this offer starts on 12/21?"
PS4Deals,2plbfx,JLimSD,2,Wed Dec 17 22:55:27 2014 UTC,"Yep, it's in the title."
PS4Deals,2plbfx,Golden_Taint,2,Thu Dec 18 20:58:51 2014 UTC,Thank you.
PS4Deals,2plbfx,JLimSD,6,Thu Dec 18 21:43:51 2014 UTC,"I wish you could buy it online only because my local Best Buy is a pain in the assignment to get to.   I'll probably drive there anyway, though."
PS4Deals,2plbfx,kilroyishere89,1 point,Wed Dec 17 19:13:28 2014 UTC,"You do have to buy it in store, but once you have it you can use it online."
PS4Deals,2plbfx,Golden_Taint,9,Wed Dec 17 19:58:16 2014 UTC,"Best Buy's GCU membership is the best gaming deal out and is typically $100-120 for two years, this is a killer deal. 20% off of all new games for that time period is huge, it's already saved me a ton of money."
PS4Deals,2plbfx,Golden_Taint,0,Wed Dec 17 18:29:52 2014 UTC,"best buy is only games on disc, right?"
PS4Deals,2plbfx,spykid,1 point,Wed Dec 17 18:48:01 2014 UTC,"Correct, they don't sell digital download codes. For me, the discount is worth getting up to switch discs."
PS4Deals,2plbfx,Golden_Taint,0,Wed Dec 17 22:12:28 2014 UTC,"They sell PlayStation Store cards, would you happen to know if GCU works on those? Also, does it stack on top of price matched games?"
PS4Deals,2plbfx,LazyassedNinja,1 point,Thu Dec 18 01:19:22 2014 UTC,No and no. Although price matches rarely beat their GCU pricing.
PS4Deals,2plbfx,Golden_Taint,1 point,Thu Dec 18 01:20:58 2014 UTC,Ok thanks. I don't usually buy games at full price but I might get this anyway since it stacks on top of their own sales and their promotions (like the buy 2 get 1 free that was up recently).
PS4Deals,2plbfx,LazyassedNinja,1 point,Thu Dec 18 01:28:26 2014 UTC,"Yep, exactly, combining with their deals is the best way to use it. I used my GCU with the 2 for 1 to score big for my son's Christmas, I also made like a bandit with their Black Friday deals + GCU."
PS4Deals,2plbfx,Golden_Taint,1 point,Thu Dec 18 01:52:55 2014 UTC,"No, my Bestbuy has cards (think the PlayStation Store cards) that you can buy that have different digital games on them. The pictures on the front reflect the games cover. I've seen Ghosts, Destiny, Far Cry 4, 2K15, and a few more."
PS4Deals,2plbfx,Collier1505,3,Thu Dec 18 06:20:39 2014 UTC,is the PS Plus for 3 months or a year?
PS4Deals,2plbfx,Lnkn52,4,Wed Dec 17 18:42:44 2014 UTC,That isn't a deal; it has always been $17.99 on the PS store.
PS4Deals,2plbfx,kilroyishere89,2,Wed Dec 17 19:14:52 2014 UTC,It's only for 3 months unfortunately.
PS4Deals,2plbfx,Cokeb5,3,Wed Dec 17 18:45:04 2014 UTC,"Is there some catch? Cause last time they did this I had to buy a new game, which did not have the 20% off"
PS4Deals,2plbfx,GEARHEADGus,3,Wed Dec 17 19:34:15 2014 UTC,"No catch. And by the way, the last one you did have to buy a game (I believe at $39.99 or above), but the 20% discount was absolutely supposed to be applied on the spot to that purchase. If it wasn't, go back in and point it out and they'll issue you a credit."
PS4Deals,2plbfx,Golden_Taint,2,Wed Dec 17 20:00:42 2014 UTC,"Can confirm, got a game NFS RIvals $39.99 minus 20% and GCU for $30."
PS4Deals,2plbfx,digitalgoodtime,3,Wed Dec 17 20:47:15 2014 UTC,Does this work on gaming accessories?
PS4Deals,2plbfx,kingramsesiii,1 point,Wed Dec 17 22:38:21 2014 UTC,Unfortunately not.
PS4Deals,2plbfx,Cokeb5,3,Thu Dec 18 20:33:56 2014 UTC,Damn. Wow. Done deal. Finally jumping onto the GCU boat.
PS4Deals,2plbfx,disorder1991,2,Thu Dec 18 18:39:51 2014 UTC,"Welcome. :)  For us deal shoppers, it sure makes it easy to know I can get a nice discount all the time without trying."
PS4Deals,2plbfx,Golden_Taint,2,Thu Dec 18 21:02:14 2014 UTC,Is this for games only or could I buy a console with the 20% off?
PS4Deals,2plbfx,needhaje,2,Wed Dec 17 21:35:58 2014 UTC,"Games only. It does also apply to Skylander and Infinity characters, which does come in handy since my son is 9 and loves Skylanders."
PS4Deals,2plbfx,Golden_Taint,2,Wed Dec 17 22:16:49 2014 UTC,Can I buy this online or do I have to go in store?
PS4Deals,2plbfx,Maximus_Realius,3,Wed Dec 17 21:48:35 2014 UTC,"You have to buy the membership in store. Once it's on your account, you can shop with it online."
PS4Deals,2plbfx,Golden_Taint,3,Wed Dec 17 22:17:08 2014 UTC,Do they ask for your info in store or do you just have to buy the card in store? I have a buddy who works at Best Buy and would much rather avoid my local store a few days before xmas.
PS4Deals,2plbfx,indrv,2,Wed Dec 17 23:09:07 2014 UTC,"Yeah, they need all your info because it's being attached to your rewards account. So it ties to your phone number, name, etc."
PS4Deals,2plbfx,Golden_Taint,2,Thu Dec 18 21:00:37 2014 UTC,Follow up.. does it stack? Could I buy 2 and have it last for 4 years?
PS4Deals,2plbfx,Maximus_Realius,3,Wed Dec 17 23:21:47 2014 UTC,"You can, yes. A lot of deals can happen over two years, you could do one and see what else pops up over that time period."
PS4Deals,2plbfx,Golden_Taint,2,Wed Dec 17 23:33:16 2014 UTC,"So me and 2 coworkers totally want to go in on this and I read the small print that says ""you can get up to 3 copies of each title per platform"". Has anyone had luck with this? This would ensure that we all can get the same game and play online together. I know $30 isn't a lot, but I still have Christmas gifts to get and a PS+ sub to renew in a weeks time, and splitting the cost 3 ways would make this an easy buy in."
PS4Deals,2plbfx,yeahyeahba,6,Wed Dec 17 21:51:38 2014 UTC,"Yes, you're allowed to buy 3 copies of each game per system. If you want to go in with your buddies and split it, just remember that it's going to be under one person's name and that person will be the only one who can buy with the discount."
PS4Deals,2plbfx,Golden_Taint,2,Wed Dec 17 22:22:25 2014 UTC,"Good to know. We planned on that being the case. I was fine with spliting the cost since I have 2 kids now and I don't get to spend as much money (and time) on video games. But I still want to be able to get a discount on games that I truly want, as well as keep up on games they want to play online."
PS4Deals,2plbfx,yeahyeahba,1 point,Wed Dec 17 23:08:55 2014 UTC,Is this $30 for two years then? I'm thinking I may just have to pick this up.
PS4Deals,2plbfx,Cokeb5,5,Wed Dec 17 18:39:43 2014 UTC,"Yep, for 2 years from buy date."
PS4Deals,2plbfx,Golden_Taint,1 point,Wed Dec 17 19:57:09 2014 UTC,Anybody have a link to a non-weird site? Work is blocking whatever the heck that link is.

PS4Deals,2plbfx,digitalgoodtime,4,Wed Dec 17 19:40:30 2014 UTC,"It's been on sale multiple times, you should keep track on /r/PS4Deals."
PS4Deals,2plbfx,Golden_Taint,1 point,Wed Dec 17 20:01:16 2014 UTC,Think I will go pick this up!  What are the other benefits.

PS4Deals,2plbfx,cats05,1 point,Fri Dec 19 20:03:53 2014 UTC,Where do you find the sneak peek of the Best Buy ad?

PS4Deals,2plbfx,cats05,1 point,Sun Dec 21 19:00:47 2014 UTC,"I just picked it up today for the $30. Even the Cashier asked me, ""how did you get it for that price?""  Haha. Some good half off sales in vita games too. $14.99 for freedom wars"

PS4Deals,2pjb5x,G0VERNMENTCHEESE,4,Wed Dec 17 02:33:10 2014 UTC,Most of their PS4 games have been on sale for several weeks.
PS4Deals,2pjb5x,tjb1,2,Wed Dec 17 03:20:13 2014 UTC,"Yea, I picked up Killzone for $10. Unfortunately they didn't have any copies of MGS available."

PS4Deals,2pjb5x,hamburgersandfries,3,Wed Dec 17 18:22:37 2014 UTC,Damn. Just had it delivered yesterday from amazon for $10 haha
PS4Deals,2pjb5x,BTY2468,2,Wed Dec 17 12:18:20 2014 UTC,show amazon the ad and they will give you the 5 bucks back maybe
PS4Deals,2pjb5x,hamburgersandfries,1 point,Wed Dec 17 18:23:05 2014 UTC,"I don't know. I checked Amazon's price match, they only seem to price match televisions and phones. They said they won't price match anything else, which includes video games unfortunately."
PS4Deals,2pjb5x,coolgaara,2,Thu Dec 18 05:09:03 2014 UTC,Just price-matched with bestbuy.com.   Going to pick it up in a few days when the GC Unlocked deal is available so I only have to make one trip.
PS4Deals,2pjb5x,kilroyishere89,1 point,Wed Dec 17 19:07:02 2014 UTC,You can price match online?
PS4Deals,2pjb5x,Shaftstriker,1 point,Thu Dec 18 01:19:19 2014 UTC,"Only with local competitors. I went to bestbuy.com and found the Metal Gear Solid V listing. It's listed for $19.99. On the page it says 'price match guarantee' above the price. I clicked on that and called the phone number and directed the lady that answered to the listing on kmart.com. I had to give the SKU number, which is easily found at the listing.   She tried to argue that the one listed on bestbuy.com was a digital copy(BB doesn't price march digital content) because the publisher is Konami Digital Entertainment and the listing on kmart.com doesn't say that. I knew that was wrong because I've never known BB to sell digital games online, so I said as much and referenced that when you click on the details tab under 'number of discs' it says 1, so that means there is a disc involved.   It took 25 or 30 minutes, I'd say. She left a couple of times to go check on the kmart.com listing and I guess to ask someone about the digital content versus physical copy thing.   I paid over the phone(which I didn't expect to do, but whatever) and am having it sent to my local store so I don't have to pay for shipping."
PS4Deals,2pjb5x,kilroyishere89,1 point,Thu Dec 18 02:27:16 2014 UTC,"Ok, thanks I will be sure to try this, will be trying to get 3 copies"
PS4Deals,2pjb5x,Shaftstriker,1 point,Thu Dec 18 02:42:36 2014 UTC,"Also, would there be any other way of paying?"
PS4Deals,2pjb5x,Shaftstriker,1 point,Thu Dec 18 02:47:29 2014 UTC,"I paid over the phone. I didn't really expect or want to, but meh.   I dunno if this is possible, but I expected to be e-mailed a link to their website with the updated price so I could buy the game myself, because I was intending to browse the site for other deals.   Meh, paying over the phone saved me some cash."
PS4Deals,2pjb5x,kilroyishere89,1 point,Thu Dec 18 03:35:55 2014 UTC,Kk ill be sure to ask if theres another method or something. Thanks!
PS4Deals,2pjb5x,Shaftstriker,1 point,Thu Dec 18 03:38:39 2014 UTC,"If they've sold out, I think you can go to Target and price match it."
PS4Deals,2pjb5x,rytron83,2,Wed Dec 17 07:08:06 2014 UTC,"Just did this at my local target. I had to talk to guest services who initially OKd it, then I had to go back to the electronics section where the lady who had to unlock the case kept saying ""we don't price match kmart.com"" I told her the guy up front said it was ok, and she DID price match it for me, but you would have thought the difference was coming out of their paychecks they way she and her coworker were looking at me.   TLDR; my local target price matched it begrudgingly, YMMV."
PS4Deals,2pjb5x,DamnCroissants,1 point,Wed Dec 17 22:16:47 2014 UTC,I've worked as a seasonal at Target before. Some of the workers who've worked there for years are just anal about small things.
PS4Deals,2pjb5x,shagrathspawn,1 point,Wed Dec 17 22:21:17 2014 UTC,"Yeah, many of the seasonal employees wouldn't care or would just do it anyways without checking the new price check system."
PS4Deals,2pjb5x,coolgaara,1 point,Thu Dec 18 01:46:22 2014 UTC,They told me they're not price matching anyone until January.
PS4Deals,2pjb5x,hamburgersandfries,1 point,Thu Dec 18 05:55:18 2014 UTC,"Man, Bestbuy must hate me. Tried 3 times for price match for different products. Refused every time. This time they said it was because it was not withint 25 miles AND the product is online order only."

PS4Deals,2phuo7,Max_Character_Limit-,3,Tue Dec 16 22:07:17 2014 UTC,Is Hotline Miami for $3 worth it?
PS4Deals,2phuo7,WertyBurger,4,Tue Dec 16 20:28:03 2014 UTC,Hell yes! That game is just downright fun. The soundtrack alone is worth more than $3.
PS4Deals,2phuo7,anduin2000,3,Tue Dec 16 20:59:54 2014 UTC,Hotline should be an instabuy for anybody that doesnt already have it
PS4Deals,2phuo7,straub42,2,Tue Dec 16 23:39:06 2014 UTC,"Sale should be live on the PSN store (US / Canada) after the update later this afternoon / evening. Some reasonably good PS4 deals.

PS4Deals,2phuo7,kilroyishere89,1 point,Tue Dec 16 19:10:34 2014 UTC,"Anybody have any experience with Sleeping Dogs? I just learned that it was a planned addition to the True Crime franchise on the PS2 back in the day, but it got canceled. Square Enix purchased the game from Activision, but didn't purchase the True Crime name, hence the different name for the finished product.   I loved True Crime: Streets of LA and TC: NYC."
PS4Deals,2phuo7,derrtybird,1 point,Tue Dec 16 20:58:34 2014 UTC,"The original got pretty decent reviews, most seemed to like it. The remaster is a better looking version of the original. It's an open world shooter similar to GTA I'd say. Will probably get it since I never played the original."

PS4Deals,2phuo7,G4mbit,2,Tue Dec 16 19:57:42 2014 UTC,Is it any good.  What's the game play like.  I did the same as you

PS4Deals,2pfbre,Sgt_ZigZag,0,Wed Dec 24 07:42:04 2014 UTC,Good game but I can't figure out how to use the weapons that I equip.
PS4Deals,2pfbre,Golden_Taint,4,Tue Dec 16 05:08:35 2014 UTC,"Default is X for your actual equipped weapon, but I'm guessing that's not what you mean. What issue are you having exactly?"
PS4Deals,2pfbre,Sgt_ZigZag,-1,Tue Dec 16 06:00:46 2014 UTC,Well the monks x attack just doesn't appear to use the weapons but as others have pointed out this is class dependent.
PS4Deals,2pfbre,doomrabbit,4,Tue Dec 16 14:35:52 2014 UTC,"Your weapon may not appear in your attacks. It is still giving you the stats and bonuses of the weapon, but the attack animation you see may not include the weapon, especially for wizard and witch doctor classes which rely on spells."
PS4Deals,2pfbre,llamateizer,3,Tue Dec 16 12:26:40 2014 UTC,which class you have? some weapons cannot be used by some class (even if you can equip it).  Is it a wizard with a sword?
PS4Deals,2pfbre,Sgt_ZigZag,0,Tue Dec 16 13:49:50 2014 UTC,I'm playing with the monk.

PS4Deals,2pfbre,llamateizer,2,Tue Dec 16 17:05:01 2014 UTC,different RPG game than Destiny. Really Enjoyed both games. D3 is more fun with friends (couch co-op).

PS4Deals,2pg5fj,spiningthelock,2,Tue Dec 16 07:17:30 2014 UTC,Can anyone confirm?
PS4Deals,2pg5fj,thedaradotcom,2,Tue Dec 16 14:00:31 2014 UTC,Tried using the code on a regular credit card order. Didn't work. Not sure what a MasterPass is.

PS4Deals,2pg5fj,new2it,2,Wed Dec 17 18:36:06 2014 UTC,"I was really hoping for a good PS Plus Deal this year... starting to think those 12 month for $40 deals were the best we are going to get. Everyone was expecting it to go down to $30, but I think the lowest ive seen was 35 under special circumstances (promo codes). Does anyone else think we will see a 12 month for $30 before christmas. I would imagine that alot of peoples 12 month subscriptions are going to be ending in the next month or so.  Edited: a letter"
PS4Deals,2pg5fj,Cokeb5,1 point,Tue Dec 16 20:05:55 2014 UTC,"I highly doubt we'll see it for $30 this year. Everyone who's buying that subscription needs it for their PS4, and ultimately they'll pay $40 for it because of that, so there's no incentive for Sony to push a large sale on it."
PS4Deals,2pg5fj,kilroyishere89,2,Wed Dec 17 13:16:33 2014 UTC,"Rakuten did this deal a few weeks ago if you paid using PayPal and a ton of people jumped on it and were able to get it to work. But they sold out fast, I guess.  I tried to get it to work a ton of times, but I guess it didn't work if they were being sold by Red Dot. I gave up after screwing with it for an hour or so."
PS4Deals,2pg5fj,Cokeb5,2,Tue Dec 16 20:55:39 2014 UTC,"Be wary of buying anything at Rakuten, especially with a credit card. If you Google ""Rakuten reviews"" you will see they are infamous for stealing/leaking credit card info. I would advise only buying from them on deals where you can use PayPal."
PS4Deals,2pg5fj,omegawolf,4,Tue Dec 16 16:10:53 2014 UTC,For this deal to work you have to use MasterPass. Which means your payment details are not been shared with Rakuten.

The only ones I got was:  I fell through the floor once; got stuck on the floor once, grabbed a ""ledge"" in mid air.   And that was it. Out of my full gameplay and lots of co-op. And this was even before their first patch. I think YMMV but for me, I didn't get any graphics errors or anything that forced me not to play (other than crappy Uplay server connections which I think they fixed by now). Also, the co-op IS fun and the gameplay is fun. And the world is beautiful. People give Ubisoft crap about it but I liked the game from near day 1 (got it a week after it came out) and had no real bugs (for me), unlike Dragon Age Inquisitions which gave me a lot more trouble."
PS4Deals,2pbwu8,Golden_Taint,2,Mon Dec 15 04:55:05 2014 UTC,"Great deal.  A slightly better deal is to get the controller from Sears for $29,   and the game from Amazon for $13  If no Sears in your area have them in stock, Target will price-match (Bestbuy/Walmart probably would too)  Don't know how long these deals will last, but it works out cheaper if you want the Glacier white or the Black controller"
PS4Deals,2pbwu8,chandleross,3,Mon Dec 15 22:23:58 2014 UTC,"Target won't price match Sears, they're stricter about who they'll match. A bunch of people have been turned down at Best Buy and Walmart trying to match that price, so this is a good option."
PS4Deals,2pbwu8,Sgt_ZigZag,2,Tue Dec 16 00:02:05 2014 UTC,"FYI I was able to price match the $29 controller deal from Sears at Walmart but of course on any price matching, YMMV."

PS4Deals,2pa8kp,hezeus,2,Wed Dec 17 18:22:08 2014 UTC,Just picked up a PS4. You save a good bit with that 15%. I think I'm going to download Far Cry 4 for the game I choose....
PS4Deals,2pa8kp,amxn,1 point,Wed Dec 17 22:22:15 2014 UTC,Does anyone know how long they're gonna have the bundles available? I assume through the holidays but I could be wrong.
PS4Deals,2pa8kp,OprahNoodlemantra,3,Sun Dec 14 23:11:08 2014 UTC,Not sure about the bundles but the coupon is only until the 20th.
PS4Deals,2pa8kp,AlonzoMoseley,1 point,Mon Dec 15 01:23:38 2014 UTC,This was a BF bundle. So I doubt they have enough stocks to last through Christmas and the New Year. But I could be wrong as well ;)
PS4Deals,2pa8kp,AlonzoMoseley,1 point,Mon Dec 15 00:23:04 2014 UTC,I hope it lasts so I can put Xmas cash to use. I've seen a few good deals on various sites so hopefully one of them holds out for me.
PS4Deals,2pa8kp,emptyday77,1 point,Mon Dec 15 00:33:32 2014 UTC,"The Target website shows plenty of Target stores near me having ""PS4 Bundle with Grand Theft Auto V & The Last of Us: Remastered"" in stock, but when I went to some of them, they were all like, 'oh yeah that bundle ended a while back... but you can buy the bundle with just one game'. Bait & switch."
PS4Deals,2pa8kp,AlonzoMoseley,3,Mon Dec 15 03:19:34 2014 UTC,"That doesn't make sense. Each bundle has a different item number and DPCI code, the system wouldn't show them in stock unless they are. Plus, plenty of people have bought that exact bundle with this deal.  I would call customer service, explain what's going on. They'll give you a case number to reference and basically force the store to sell it to you at the $399 price, plus your Cartwheel discount."
PS4Deals,2pa8kp,Kami_no_Kage,1 point,Mon Dec 15 03:32:32 2014 UTC,"I carried on checking. All the stores say that they're out, and that the 'system must just be slow in updating because of the holidays'. One of them, the system says they have 8 of them, yet they're out.  Has anyone managed to get the GTAV/TLOU bundle lately?  Maybe Target have taken the bundles and broken them down into PS4s, GTAVs and TLOUs to sell separately, but their system doesn't recognize that.  Either that or it is a bait and switch to get people to drive to the store and end up buying a lesser package."
PS4Deals,2pa8kp,REEB,2,Mon Dec 15 16:59:28 2014 UTC,Happened to me too. Drove a little farther to go to the one target that said they had it in stock and they didn't have it. Was told it was discontinued.
PS4Deals,2pa8kp,Tumeric98,1 point,Fri Dec 19 06:41:34 2014 UTC,"Classic bait and switch. It's the same tactic they do in seedy electronics stores in Hong Kong. They advertise a good price on something, then make you sit around waiting while they go and fetch stock. You sit around for ages, meanwhile they show you alternatives with a higher margin. Eventually if you don't take an alternative they come back and say they don't have it.  A company of Target's size could and should have a stock level system that works. They'll wriggle out by pointing at a smallprint disclaimer, but it's still a bait and switch however you look at it."
PS4Deals,2pa8kp,AlonzoMoseley,2,Fri Dec 19 16:03:14 2014 UTC,"A couple of days late, but yeah, happened to me yesterday. Went to one with stock, out for a week. Call another one with stock, nope. Got the one game one suggested at both, feels like a bait and switch to me."
PS4Deals,2pa8kp,THUMB5UP,1 point,Wed Dec 17 14:36:07 2014 UTC,Question for those who bought... do you have to ask for the $20 PSN credit? I completely forgot about it and I don't see anything on the receipt or on the box...
PS4Deals,2pa8kp,THUMB5UP,2,Mon Dec 15 19:54:58 2014 UTC,"You have to buy the $20 card at the same time. When it gets rung up, the $20 card is activated and you pay $0.   I actually forgot to get the card so I went back into the store with my receipt and they refunded and purchased again."

Anyway, if you missed out on that Id highly recommend getting it, game is fantastic and arguably the best looking PS4 game Ive played so far.

PS4Deals,2p8rj3,I_like_dwagons,3,Sun Dec 14 12:46:00 2014 UTC,"You have to walk into a PS TV purchase with understanding it's strengths and weaknesses. Yes, there are some Vita games not currently supported but hopefully that will be changing in time. Netflix will come eventually for those waiting on it too. It really shines in certain situations though. Take last night for example: My gf and her two kids were watching tv in the living room (where the PS4 is set up) and I was itching to try out the new Destiny expansion content (The Dark Below). So I went in our bedroom and closed the door, put on my Sony Gold Wireless Headset (the signal reaches the PS4 in the living room) and rocked out on the TV in our bed room. The convenience alone makes it worth it to me. Not to mention that you'd be hard pressed to find a gaming device with this huge of a library (including PS Now) and versatility at an $70 price point."
PS4Deals,2p8rj3,anduin2000,2,Sun Dec 14 14:41:05 2014 UTC,"This sums it up nicely, I also picked up a playstation tv on release.  My main reasoning was that I love jrpgs and the vita/psp has a ton of them. I do have a vita but most of the time I play at home anyway so for me it makes more sense to be able to play on the tv. At this price if you have a ps4 and any interest in vita/psp games it's a must buy."
PS4Deals,2p8rj3,dorinere,1 point,Sun Dec 14 14:54:01 2014 UTC,Do you have proof of this Netflix arrival?

At launch, PS TV has video streaming apps Crackle, Crunchyroll, and Qello. Stay tuned for additional entertainment content we’ll be adding soon to the PS TV lineup"".  My bad for jumping the gun. I think it's a safe bet though since Vita has the Netflix app and Ps TV is based on the same hardware."
PS4Deals,2p8rj3,anduin2000,-1,Wed Dec 17 13:24:44 2014 UTC,There's no evidence to prove this.  We still don't have profile support on Netflix for Vita...  On a related note: I wonder if I'll have my first child before HBO GO comes to PS4?

PS4Deals,2p3bg8,swotam,1 point,Fri Dec 12 16:55:32 2014 UTC,"Advertised as $30 off MSRP, not a bad deal for two recently released titles assuming that you have PS4 and PS3.  Offer is available at Best Buy Canada and Future Shop (they're the same company after all). Available for online ordering with free shipping or for in-store pickup."
PS4Deals,2oxv3m,Golden_Taint,2,Thu Dec 11 04:15:20 2014 UTC,"This goes live on Sunday, the price is for a physical copy. For GCU members, this means you can score it for $31.99."

PS4Deals,2oxv3m,SoulGreat,2,Thu Dec 11 05:51:42 2014 UTC,They will not. But you can stack GCU with the 2 for 1 if you're a member.
PS4Deals,2oxv3m,cats05,1 point,Thu Dec 11 05:52:58 2014 UTC,Will this be for Canada also?
PS4Deals,2oxikz,Cokeb5,2,Thu Dec 11 02:19:14 2014 UTC,Back up to $55.35 as of now.
PS4Deals,2oxikz,emperorwuofwei,2,Thu Dec 11 14:34:37 2014 UTC,It was usually a few months before seeing a price drop into the $40s with PS3 games.  This came out a month ago and is $45.  Dragon Age 3 weeks ago and is $40.  I like it this trend.
PS4Deals,2oxikz,SenorV,1 point,Thu Dec 11 21:10:50 2014 UTC,"Advanced Warfare has seen a very positive response since it's release, and thus it's held onto its value very well. I haven't seen many sales on it, but this ones decent for those looking!"
PS4Deals,2oxikz,reggiegrip,0,Thu Dec 11 02:20:00 2014 UTC,Opposed to any other one ever?

PS4Deals,2owbg1,vfxMarlon,1 point,Sun Dec 14 23:58:04 2014 UTC,try $50 and $10 maybe?
PS4Deals,2ovfsz,Endymion86,3,Wed Dec 10 15:59:32 2014 UTC,How long will it stay $40?
PS4Deals,2ovfsz,dreamondreamer,1 point,Thu Dec 11 01:25:36 2014 UTC,Wondering if I could price match this on any buy 2 get one frees
PS4Deals,2ovfsz,SrsSteel,3,Wed Dec 10 16:56:32 2014 UTC,You can at best buy. Did it yesterday. Price matched dragon age to targets $47.99 and titanfall and GTA to amazon. People will usually do it if you are polite and do the price matching first and then ask about b2g1 when they are done.
PS4Deals,2ovfsz,Schorschbrau,2,Wed Dec 10 21:14:39 2014 UTC,"I had the opposite experience. I asked politely and was immediately shut down by them, saying that the system wouldn't let them do both. Your mileage may vary I suppose."
PS4Deals,2ovfsz,cynicalhuang,1 point,Thu Dec 11 00:34:59 2014 UTC,"I've found best buy to be a pain in the ass with price matching, target is way more customer friendly."
PS4Deals,2ovfsz,RespectThyHypnotoad,2,Wed Dec 17 01:43:19 2014 UTC,I doubt it. They usually have a clause about stacking promotions. As always though it's YMMV.
PS4Deals,2ovfsz,Sgt_ZigZag,1 point,Wed Dec 10 17:09:46 2014 UTC,"Wow, after just buying my own copy last week for full price. XD"

PS4Deals,2ovfsz,Vaunz,1 point,Wed Dec 10 19:33:45 2014 UTC,"yeah, i bought it at Walmart and how can I do that?"
PS4Deals,2ovfsz,Sgt_ZigZag,1 point,Thu Dec 11 06:24:05 2014 UTC,"Just go to the customer service desk with your receipt and use the words ""refund the difference""."
PS4Deals,2ovfsz,Sl33pyh34d,1 point,Thu Dec 11 15:03:23 2014 UTC,Ah I just saw this! Is it over?
PS4Deals,2orkft,Golden_Taint,3,Tue Dec 9 16:16:22 2014 UTC,"FYI, you can also use this to price match at Best Buy."
PS4Deals,2orkft,xEleanorxRigbyx,2,Tue Dec 9 16:17:34 2014 UTC,Also Walmart.
PS4Deals,2oqfit,Golden_Taint,3,Tue Dec 9 07:06:38 2014 UTC,"Awesome deal! I grabbed this a few weeks ago and am loving it! It was my first Dragon Age game and honestly I'm a bigger fan of Skyrim's combat system (I don't like the tactical combat games as much) but without using the tactical camera DA: I has been really fun! Incredible story and great dialogue, plus the world they created is just stunning.  I was heavily skeptical about all the praise this game was getting over in /r/PS4 but I think it's pretty much lived up to the hype. If you're on the fence about getting this game, I would highly recommend you do especially for this price."
PS4Deals,2oqfit,The_King_Of_Nothing,2,Tue Dec 9 14:02:41 2014 UTC,"Think ill grab this, thanks."

PS4Deals,2op5ab,Golden_Taint,3,Mon Dec 8 23:39:41 2014 UTC,Got it. Amazing for digital. THIS should have been on the black friday sale.

PS4Deals,2oo3a1,Mr_pessimister,1 point,Mon Dec 8 21:48:37 2014 UTC,Is there a good racing sim out right now for the PS4? Something like GT or Forza?
PS4Deals,2oo3a1,BalrogAndRoll,3,Mon Dec 8 21:52:09 2014 UTC,I think your best bet for a sim on PS4 is going to be Project Cars coming mid march.
PS4Deals,2oo3a1,Mr_pessimister,1 point,Mon Dec 8 22:13:45 2014 UTC,Crew is arcade style. Nice username btw.
PS4Deals,2omup8,Golden_Taint,2,Mon Dec 8 10:01:08 2014 UTC,One of the best games for PS4 to date and very underrated.

PS4Deals,2omunn,anduin2000,2,Mon Dec 8 10:00:37 2014 UTC,That's a hell of a deal. I would get it if not for the fact that I may be getting it for Christmas. Ahh! First world problems.
PS4Deals,2omunn,PornoPichu,2,Mon Dec 8 16:05:57 2014 UTC,Why can't they put the digital code on sale ffs

PS4Deals,2omduq,Golden_Taint,1 point,Mon Dec 8 05:44:43 2014 UTC,Will I be getting the gift card AND the game or will the gift card be used to purchase a 50$ game? Tried selecting this in the website but it showed the cost of the game included. How do I make this work :( sorry the ultra noobness

EDIT: For clarification, you enter the code and you'll select one of the four games.  Also, I'd recommend Far Cry over Destiny as I don't have enough time for the grind in Destiny."
PS4Deals,2omduq,Xineus,1 point,Mon Dec 8 15:56:04 2014 UTC,Alright thanks! I really enjoyed far cry 3 an wanted to know if Destiny deserved a fair shake before I pulled the trigger.
PS4Deals,2omduq,Africanfratboy,1 point,Mon Dec 8 17:29:35 2014 UTC,What are the four games we can choose from? It's not clear to me on the website. (Maybe I didn't look far enough.)

I ended up emailing them and within two hours they responded and said sorry they could not fulfill my order and sent me a refund. So at least that was nice but still. I had been waiting for the game and now will have to find a new deal or just pay full price since I have been wanting it.

PS4Deals,2oaxgp,shiverBoots,3,Fri Dec 5 19:39:10 2014 UTC,"Got the game, pretty glad I got it for $5 rather than the original price.  $40 for 1 story mission and a couple side ops. Would've been pretty pissed."
PS4Deals,2oaxgp,xdonoflondonx,1 point,Sun Dec 7 20:38:29 2014 UTC,it was still worth it
PS4Deals,2oaxgp,VacationAwayFromWork,2,Tue Dec 9 23:46:04 2014 UTC,I placed an order for store pickup but they canceled it a bit later. Ah well. Good deal if you can find one in stock.
PS4Deals,2oaxgp,Cokeb5,3,Fri Dec 5 00:17:13 2014 UTC,Maybe you get a price match at Walmart?
PS4Deals,2oaxgp,mragentchaos,2,Fri Dec 5 02:57:10 2014 UTC,"They typically only will if it's in stock, but it's worth a shot. Thanks!"
PS4Deals,2oaxgp,Cokeb5,2,Fri Dec 5 04:55:34 2014 UTC,"I just got it priced matched at Best Buy, they didn't really check if Kmart had in stock."

PS4Deals,2oaxgp,tjb1,1 point,Fri Dec 5 05:16:15 2014 UTC,Good find. I will try to price match at my local Target. They've honored Brandsmart and Kmart prices before.
PS4Deals,2oaxgp,shinecrazy,1 point,Fri Dec 5 15:33:45 2014 UTC,Let us know if it works?
PS4Deals,2oaxgp,the-jedi,3,Fri Dec 5 23:31:49 2014 UTC,"it did work but the supervisor at Customer Service said they can not honor Kmart.com deals...and said they would just do it this one time. even though they honored Shadow of Mordor for me a few weeks ago, without really looking into it. So I think it's kinda case by case basis.   Doesn't help my case that someone made a fake Amazon ad for $80 PS4s a while back and used it there."
PS4Deals,2oaxgp,shinecrazy,2,Sat Dec 6 04:27:39 2014 UTC,Yea i remember reading about that. One bad apple can ruin the tree ya know. But im glad it worked for you. Congrats

PS4Deals,2ob4ev,Falcorion,1 point,Thu Dec 4 23:27:23 2014 UTC,"Supposedly it's gotten a lot better the past couple months ESPECIALLY with the recent update.  A lot of people seem to forget that this is a MMOFPS, not a new Halo with an amazing story. The gameplay is solid, the PvP is fun, the raids are great and the progression is rewarding. It is a good MMOFPS, but not a good game as far as campaigns go compared to Bungie's Halo track record."
PS4Deals,2ob4ev,swotam,1 point,Fri Dec 5 16:25:05 2014 UTC,the progression is rewarding   You must be playing a different Destiny from me :)

PS4Deals,2o29q9,Cokeb5,1 point,Tue Dec 2 18:15:08 2014 UTC,I wonder if we can stack the trade in a game for a 20% off coupon with the 10% off Far Cry 4. That would bring it down to like $36.
PS4Deals,2o29q9,nervana,3,Tue Dec 2 18:51:05 2014 UTC,"Beauty of Cartwheel app, it stacks with anything. Yes."

PS4Deals,2o29q9,lilgadget,1 point,Tue Dec 2 20:25:17 2014 UTC,"Hmm, I'm not sure.  I'm inclined to say no since I don't think you immediately get the card.    If you're going to try though, it's worth noting that for the debit version, you need to provide a voided check."
PS4Deals,2o29q9,Asuranaut,1 point,Tue Dec 2 20:32:53 2014 UTC,"Wait! I might be wrong.  You might be able to do it if you apply for the debit card.  I just found this is another forum:  ""Edit 11/20/11 I applied for the card in store on Saturday. Very impressive experience: they took my DL and SS #s, voided a check, and spit out a receipt with a temporary card number very shortly after. I was able to use the card on a test purchase in the store that same day."""

All of the Targets near me have them in stock. I'm going to go pick one up now! I think I can just cancel my Best Buy order on the site. It hasn't been delivered to the store yet. Hopefully there isn't a problem with that.
PS4Deals,2o29q9,Ampenda,2,Tue Dec 2 23:44:16 2014 UTC,I did the same. I just purchased it form Target and I plan on returning my Best Buy PS4 as soon as it's delivered. Plus Target added a free recharge station!

PS4Deals,2o29q9,suicide_and_again,2,Sat Dec 6 02:51:46 2014 UTC,Wait for what? It doesn't go below this. GTA 5 is barely weeks old. The Last of Us Remaster isn't old either.  This is the best deal you're going to get until the stocks run out. Newegg already marked these up to $450. $360 for just the console and a game itself are good enough.
PS4Deals,2o29q9,Fatty_Boombalattie,1 point,Wed Dec 3 01:17:03 2014 UTC,So mad I paid 399 for it on Amazon.
PS4Deals,2o29q9,turkeyjr,1 point,Wed Dec 3 05:55:50 2014 UTC,"All the Targets close to me were sold out of this bundle.

PS4Deals,2o29q9,Newwackydeli,1 point,Sat Dec 6 02:53:45 2014 UTC,"You could get them to price match it. It's at Sears.com right now for $44.99. Sears is not on Target's official price match list, but they'll do it. Worst case just ask for a manager, they'd rather price match it then have your return it."
PS4Deals,2o29q9,FlutGOS,1 point,Sat Dec 6 02:55:57 2014 UTC,"I might run to Walmart real quick then. I had to drive an hour to target Wednesday to get the deal. Some reason there's no target in my area. I wish Ps store would price match, I have $40 waiting to be spent on my account."
PS4Deals,2o29q9,Crazyanubis,1 point,Sat Dec 6 03:04:14 2014 UTC,"You could do that, buy it somewhere else and return yours to Target. FYI, Best Buy will price match too if that's closer."

PS4Deals,2o0x88,CrewCutKid,3,Fri Dec 5 05:08:11 2014 UTC,"Additionally, if you spend $75 today you will get a 20% off coupon for a future purchase. Even gift cards get the coupon, and you'll be spending that much anyways so you might as well save another 20%."
PS4Deals,2o0x88,Cokeb5,2,Sat Dec 6 19:23:26 2014 UTC,Can you use the coupon on top of a price match?
PS4Deals,2o0x88,peachspecial,3,Sat Dec 6 21:06:25 2014 UTC,"At my local Targets, they're very strict on combining price matches with these promos and they don't allow it. The 20% coupon should work in the system, however your only obstacle would be the employee not allowing it."

PS4Deals,2o0x88,SrsSteel,2,Tue Dec 2 18:11:08 2014 UTC,I like your style.
PS4Deals,2o0x88,Cokeb5,2,Tue Dec 2 18:13:19 2014 UTC,Damn. I would totally do this if Dragon age was on that list. Dragon age and Far Cry 4 and get a 50 dollar gift card would be epic.

PS4Deals,2o0x88,steadymobbin,1 point,Tue Dec 2 17:15:34 2014 UTC,"No way to know right now. The ad states the regular PS4, but it'll probably be a store by store situation if they'll allow the bundle as part of the promo."

PS4Deals,2nyldu,Shockcrazy,2,Mon Dec 1 20:41:13 2014 UTC,"A lot of dealers won't do that, because it leaves them at risk of being scammed by buyers. Many people have burned dealers by requesting the code, getting it, then filing a claim with Paypal saying they never received a shipment. That's why you see deals like this where they send it to you, there's a record of it being delivered."

PS4Deals,2nylpr,suicide_and_again,3,Mon Dec 1 20:16:06 2014 UTC,Multiplayer is amazing.
PS4Deals,2nylpr,Wadsworth34,2,Mon Dec 1 22:15:21 2014 UTC,"Multiplayer is great if you can see past the little issues it has, such as the sound and polygons not loading until 30 seconds to a minute into the match, the rigidity of trying to climb over obstacles, and your player not being able to simply walk over certain objects such as some stairs and street curbs, to name a few.   That being said, I've put about 90 hours into the multiplayer, and enjoyed it very much. But by no stretch of the imagination is this a polished game."

PS4Deals,2nylpr,spiningthelock,2,Mon Dec 1 20:57:58 2014 UTC,"Wow, and to imagine i traded it in at $25 dollars less than a month ago. Crazy, i might just buy it back. Anyone know if bf5 will come out soon though?"
PS4Deals,2nylpr,demonsoliloquy,1 point,Mon Dec 1 23:10:25 2014 UTC,"Battlefield 5 is not until late 2016. Battlefield Hardline (cops/robbers) comes out in March(?) and new Battlefront (Star Wars) next holiday season. If you prefer a military shooter, this is still the one for quite awhile."
PS4Deals,2nylpr,demonsoliloquy,2,Mon Dec 1 23:20:30 2014 UTC,Thanks for the info. I guess a stop by best buy is now required.
PS4Deals,2nylpr,tjb1,2,Mon Dec 1 23:29:56 2014 UTC,Any idea on a GOTY release with premium included?
PS4Deals,2nylpr,turtleman312,1 point,Tue Dec 2 15:48:40 2014 UTC,They have the premium edition on the ps store but it's still 60 bucks :/
PS4Deals,2nylpr,flashheatmvp3,2,Mon Dec 15 20:15:02 2014 UTC,traded it in on amazon for $22 a couple days ago

PS4Deals,2nxu9n,NetJnkie,4,Mon Dec 1 16:11:06 2014 UTC,It's delivered as PS+ cards via snail mail.
PS4Deals,2nxu9n,fitzman49,1 point,Mon Dec 1 16:46:59 2014 UTC,Seems some products still don't work..like the PS+.  They list it as a valid item...but it won't take the discount with that.  If I choose some games from the list it works fine.
PS4Deals,2nxu9n,NetJnkie,3,Mon Dec 1 16:12:15 2014 UTC,PS+ works fine.  I followed the steps above with two PS+ cards and got 30 off.
PS4Deals,2nxu9n,dennisbeck1996,2,Mon Dec 1 16:47:41 2014 UTC,Must have fixed it.  Wouldn't for me.  Would say my order wasn't eligible.  Looks like they fixed it and now out of stock on the PS+ cards.
PS4Deals,2nxu9n,RidiculousNicholas55,1 point,Mon Dec 1 17:49:23 2014 UTC,what is now ?
PS4Deals,2nxu9n,StarrFall,2,Tue Dec 2 15:40:14 2014 UTC,"Wait you entered credit card info first?  I added it to my cart, then went to checkout. I made an account there and put in my credit card. After that when I was on the final page of ordering I entered the PAYPAL30 code, in which it said I need to have a paypal payment. So I edited my payment method to paypal and my total came out to be $70+tax.  At least that's how I remember it happening, but yeah I just followed these steps exactly."

I made a separate comment, but if you have the Cartwheel app there is a new offer today, good through tomorrow, for an additional 10% off electronics that I am pretty certain you can stack with the 20% off.  Edit: Just got FC 4 for $16.01!"
PS4Deals,2nvz56,TLadd23,0,Wed Dec 3 00:18:08 2014 UTC,Nice going! I missed the Cartwheel promo when I picked up my copy off Far Cry 4 today. Got it for $31 after a trade and the 20% discount.

PS4Deals,2nuwot,Al3xPKeaton,3,Sun Nov 30 17:49:18 2014 UTC,I just picked up my ps4 bundle that comes with TLOU and GTA 5 for $400 too... I mean technically I still got a good deal but man that hurt me a little when I saw the email as soon as I got home.
PS4Deals,2nuwot,Falcorion,2,Sun Nov 30 18:51:34 2014 UTC,"Unless you didn't want those games, it's virtually the same deal. Gta is 60 and last of us is $20 at some places."
PS4Deals,2nuwot,Kidney05,2,Sun Nov 30 19:24:14 2014 UTC,No reason to feel bad if GTA 5 and TLOU are games you are excited about. If you were going to buy those 2 games anyways its the same deal
PS4Deals,2nuwot,djbeks,2,Sun Nov 30 21:43:21 2014 UTC,Yeah GTA is great so far! I never got to actually play TLOU but I have watched the play-through twice for the story.
PS4Deals,2nuwot,Falcorion,1 point,Sun Nov 30 21:55:04 2014 UTC,You can get it for just $20 if you still want to play it
PS4Deals,2nuwot,djbeks,2,Mon Dec 1 01:50:21 2014 UTC,It came with my bundle bud.
PS4Deals,2nuwot,Falcorion,2,Mon Dec 1 04:39:13 2014 UTC,On SD a ton of users were warning that Sony wouldn't honor the warranty on this since Monoprice are not authorized resellers.   I'm not sure how true that is but if it comes back in stock it may be something to think about.
PS4Deals,2nuwot,jahpo,2,Sun Nov 30 19:38:14 2014 UTC,Does Sony ask for a receipt before doing repair work?
PS4Deals,2nxpeb,0P3NMinded,8,Mon Dec 1 12:47:54 2014 UTC,Don't pay money for in game currency.  Please don't let this be a thing.
PS4Deals,2nxpeb,GenkiElite,4,Mon Dec 1 17:15:03 2014 UTC,In the end it's all personal preference. (I never bought one and doubt I ever will)   It's not like the game doesn't allow you to earn money in-game. Some people just like skipping steps at a premium cost. To each their own.
PS4Deals,2nxpeb,FancyJesse,0,Mon Dec 1 18:00:02 2014 UTC,just paid $10. Didn't feel like grinding.

PS4Deals,2nxpeb,Rounddacorner,1 point,Tue Dec 2 10:56:30 2014 UTC,Is easy and fun to earn $GTA online but this will help new players to keep up.  You should throw money on R* as they deserve it !   btw.    I won glitchy assassin bounty for ~300M $ then upgraded all cars an buy everything I could .End up that I cannot sell cars that ware pumped that way.
PS4Deals,2nsfdj,Golden_Taint,5,Sat Nov 29 21:40:23 2014 UTC,"So $35 per PS+ 12 Month Card if you buy two of them? This is looking like the best PS+ deal so far this Black Friday / Cyber Monday weekend.  Edit: Tax might kill the deal a bit, but this still looks slightly better than the ebay deal which was at $40.00 for 12 months, as long as you want two years or have a friend to split this."

PS4Deals,2nsfdj,fizboz,2,Sat Nov 29 23:45:01 2014 UTC,Wait when do you put in the code for the 30 dollars off?

PS4Deals,2nsfdj,anynigma,2,Sun Nov 30 21:49:24 2014 UTC,It looks like yes to me? But you're getting Rakuten points back so you would have to make another order. Basically store credit. This deal is literally the first time I'll shop at Rakuten so I probably won't ever take advantage of the points myself
PS4Deals,2nsfdj,AnubisEight,2,Mon Dec 1 15:32:02 2014 UTC,"Um, I'm just trying this this morning (12/1) and I'm getting the message 'This offer has expired'.

EDIT: Oh and another time I tried the message was 'Invalid Code'. What's with their website?"
PS4Deals,2nsfdj,FoxK56,2,Mon Dec 1 12:07:30 2014 UTC,"I'm getting the ""This offer has expired"" as well."

PS4Deals,2nnxvp,piercebro,3,Fri Nov 28 19:07:28 2014 UTC,I got mine at 7AM and they still had a bunch in stock. They weren't on display or really advertised at the Target near me so there's a shot they still have some stock.
PS4Deals,2nnxvp,samus1554,3,Fri Nov 28 21:21:49 2014 UTC,In Canada as well or only in the United States?

PS4Deals,2nnxvp,mynameiswrath,2,Sun Nov 30 02:13:49 2014 UTC,Should I grab this even if it's at $69.99 or is there a better alternative?

PS4Deals,2nnzvv,lynx17,3,Fri Nov 28 13:43:05 2014 UTC,"I don't understand how color controllers aren't available from the start. It seems as though it would be easy to have Blue, Red, Green, Camo, ect right at the beginning.   Thanks for the post OP, I'll be waiting for the green PS4 controller to come out...in a few years."
PS4Deals,2nnzvv,linusnc,2,Fri Nov 28 18:17:24 2014 UTC,Is the red one not available in US? It's like $70 on Amazon
PS4Deals,2nnzvv,matthewgoodnight,1 point,Fri Nov 28 18:07:18 2014 UTC,I want to jump on this deal so bad. I have two controllers already but can't justify having more as couch co-op games are so few and far between nowadays.
PS4Deals,2no0gx,DarkRaven47,1 point,Fri Nov 28 13:51:55 2014 UTC,Glacier White and Wave Blue are $39.00. Black is $39.99. Urban Camouflage is $44.98. Free shipping.
PS4Deals,2no0gx,AS14K,1 point,Fri Nov 28 13:51:59 2014 UTC,"Everything is $54-59 for me, so I don't know what you're seeing. Only the black is $39.99 Edit: Nevermind. It shows up as $54 until you click on the ""Buying Options: New"" button a little futher down. It showed up as $55 when clicking on the different colors."
PS4Deals,2nnvut,ColinZealSE,1 point,Fri Nov 28 12:36:33 2014 UTC,I suppose no way this would work in the US.  The exchange rate would probably kill us anyway :p
PS4Deals,2nnvut,adri0801,1 point,Fri Nov 28 18:40:42 2014 UTC,The exchange rate would probably kill us anyway   Negligible. The shipping would kill you guys. :)

PS4Deals,2nnkxg,NonsequiturSushi,1 point,Fri Nov 28 17:55:31 2014 UTC,no problem. i did the same exact thing
PS4Deals,2nnme3,popcan4u,1 point,Fri Nov 28 09:41:14 2014 UTC,What is the $40 credit from paypal?
PS4Deals,2nnme3,AS14K,1 point,Fri Nov 28 23:52:50 2014 UTC,"Paypal sent out emails for $40 credits from Shop.ca. If you got one of those emails, it would be applied to your purchase."
PS4Deals,2nndhd,ChrnoCrusade,0,Fri Nov 28 07:13:14 2014 UTC,anyone know if this is legit?
PS4Deals,2nndhd,KarmaElite,2,Fri Nov 28 07:13:37 2014 UTC,"I ordered one last Monday, and the voucher arrived via USPS yesterday. I had no problems redeeming it, so yeah, it's legit."
PS4Deals,2nndhd,ColinZealSE,2,Tue Dec 2 20:43:42 2014 UTC,"Nah, wouldn't trust Amazon. I mean, suddenly they popup from nowhere and gives a deal like this, like this weekend? /s"
PS4Deals,2nmc5e,NonsequiturSushi,1 point,Thu Nov 27 23:36:26 2014 UTC,"I have this for ps3, and it's pretty good.   Worth it."
PS4Deals,2nmc5e,elmntdark,1 point,Fri Nov 28 04:04:16 2014 UTC,Wish there was a deal in Canada for these!
PS4Deals,2nkdhy,Golden_Taint,8,Thu Nov 27 09:23:02 2014 UTC,ITS OUT OF STOCK AHHHHHHG
PS4Deals,2nkdhy,Katiri007,2,Thu Nov 27 15:47:17 2014 UTC,"Checkout with Visa and use code: NAFVC25  This will take $25 off of your purchase. Only other cost is shipping, which is $5.99."
PS4Deals,2nkdhy,Sl33pyh34d,2,Thu Nov 27 09:24:34 2014 UTC,"Wow great find! Visa Checkout is a little weird, the last step is a pop up window asking for more personal information and last 4 digits of SSN, is that normal? Googled a bit and this happens often on newegg, people just close out of it as there is not a skip option and that seems to make entering personal information skippable."
PS4Deals,2nkdhy,poematik,1 point,Thu Nov 27 09:41:48 2014 UTC,"Visa Checkout temporarily redirects you from whatever site you're at to Visa's servers, it's legit. It's used on tons of sites, not just Newegg."

PS4Deals,2nkdhy,yuxin_ma2005,2,Thu Nov 27 13:07:41 2014 UTC,Are there any alternatives for this deal. Amazon's screwing me with taxes!
PS4Deals,2nkdhy,Middle_Man,1 point,Thu Nov 27 20:42:05 2014 UTC,Try Dell if they still have stock.
PS4Deals,2nkdhy,venkman781,1 point,Thu Nov 27 23:19:05 2014 UTC,just bought it since amazon hasn't listed it and i had reward points for them. but this discount made it a little cheaper and now maybe can take advantage of the points getting a tablet! Thanks!
PS4Deals,2nkdhy,__devils__advocate__,2,Thu Nov 27 09:57:25 2014 UTC,Nice! Got one too. Love buying from NewEgg.
PS4Deals,2nkdhy,notoryous2,1 point,Thu Nov 27 13:03:58 2014 UTC,Just got the lbp3 and lego batman 3 bundle for the same price. 2 brand new games!

PS4Deals,2nkqzq,realwords,4,Thu Nov 27 13:17:06 2014 UTC,So is there a consensus that this is the cheapest PS+ price we are going to see?
PS4Deals,2nkqzq,ArboristDan,1 point,Thu Nov 27 19:51:46 2014 UTC,Haha I had the same thought. I might wait
PS4Deals,2nkqzq,CHIEFxBONE,1 point,Thu Nov 27 20:25:46 2014 UTC,"Can I buy a renewal year at that price? If thats bottom, then why not, y'know?"
PS4Deals,2nkqzq,StinkyDogFarts,1 point,Fri Nov 28 02:27:05 2014 UTC,"Nope, not yet.   Apparently it will be down to $35 this weekend on eBay.   Rumors flying around that we shall see even better discounts than that still to come.  So holding out for $30."
PS4Deals,2nkqzq,Gorakka,1 point,Fri Nov 28 04:00:44 2014 UTC,Are these rumors just other people posting what they're hoping for on Reddit and what happened last year?
PS4Deals,2nkqzq,Bond31,2,Sat Nov 29 01:17:01 2014 UTC,It might be getting delete because there is a sticky'd mod post for deals for black Friday. Thanks though
PS4Deals,2nkmy3,badnewsjukebox,3,Thu Nov 27 12:09:36 2014 UTC,"Order comes to $54.83, and that's before Canadian currency conversion.   Not worth it. Hopefully it'll get cheaper?"
PS4Deals,2nkmy3,Max_Character_Limit-,2,Thu Nov 27 19:56:03 2014 UTC,Check amazon.ca today. They have them on sale. Canadians rejoice!
PS4Deals,2nkmy3,DarkRaven47,2,Fri Nov 28 13:54:56 2014 UTC,Fucking Taxes man!
PS4Deals,2nkmy3,amxn,2,Thu Nov 27 20:41:21 2014 UTC,Thanks!   Amazon prime makes it a deal.
PS4Deals,2nk9dz,Golden_Taint,5,Thu Nov 27 08:14:14 2014 UTC,Amazon too.
PS4Deals,2nk9dz,DJGeorgeWashington,2,Thu Nov 27 09:31:19 2014 UTC,Sale seems to be gone now on Amazon.
PS4Deals,2nk9dz,Decrypticshadow,2,Thu Nov 27 20:02:40 2014 UTC,I think they ran out of stock
PS4Deals,2nk9dz,nachobel,1 point,Fri Nov 28 01:38:37 2014 UTC,As of 0100 est they are back at Amazon for the same price!
PS4Deals,2nk9dz,nachobel,3,Fri Nov 28 06:03:26 2014 UTC,Target has them for $39! http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=941011 that's how I found about them. Good luck if you can find the black ones.
PS4Deals,2nk9dz,necrogamesage,1 point,Fri Nov 28 05:39:49 2014 UTC,"Thank you! Just placed an order for in-store pickup, crossing my fingers that I'll score on this."
PS4Deals,2nk9dz,ntdb,1 point,Fri Nov 28 07:57:25 2014 UTC,Yes! I just got one aftrr checking 4 stores. BEWARE only the black one has the promo. The first store i went had only the white headsets and wouldnt apply the discount to the white one.
PS4Deals,2nk9dz,demonsoliloquy,1 point,Fri Nov 28 08:12:08 2014 UTC,You might be able to get a manager to do a price override if they only have the white in stock. A few people in the neogaf thread mentioned doing this. YMMV of course. But doesn't hurt to try instead of having to hit up 4 stores. :)
PS4Deals,2nk9dz,henhowc,1 point,Fri Nov 28 12:44:18 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I already was speaking to a manager after 3 employees didn't help at all."
PS4Deals,2nk9dz,demonsoliloquy,2,Fri Nov 28 15:59:16 2014 UTC,"Usually sells for $99 everywhere, nice deal. Bonus that these work with the PS4 special audio app and support virtual 7.1 surround."
PS4Deals,2nk9dz,elmntdark,2,Thu Nov 27 08:36:59 2014 UTC,Anything for Canadians? :S
PS4Deals,2nk9dz,Stupidog,1 point,Fri Nov 28 05:50:53 2014 UTC,Ordered!  Thanks!
PS4Deals,2nk9dz,eddy5791,1 point,Thu Nov 27 18:39:30 2014 UTC,Gamestop has them online too at this price. Saved myself from making a line!
PS4Deals,2nk9dz,REEB,1 point,Thu Nov 27 22:10:25 2014 UTC,"I keep seeing people comment on /r/ps4 that the mic sounds extremely ""muddy."" Is it true or overblown?"
PS4Deals,2nk9dz,jjc26p,2,Fri Nov 28 02:53:20 2014 UTC,I had them for a week so far so good.
PS4Deals,2nk9dz,henhowc,1 point,Fri Nov 28 05:06:54 2014 UTC,I can attest to this. Sent myself messages to my second account on PSN. Its passable but its definitely not as clear as the boom mic on my skullcandy plyr1s.   Tested with a friend just to get a second opinion and he says I sound muffled when I use the golds.
PS4Deals,2nkfrv,StrictlyNaija,9,Thu Nov 27 10:02:26 2014 UTC,So... does this version help you with math?
PS4Deals,2nkfrv,dj0,2,Fri Nov 28 00:37:51 2014 UTC,"$35 on Diablo III (PS4), not too shabby"
PS4Deals,2nkfrv,badmood247,3,Thu Nov 27 10:10:49 2014 UTC,Only better deal is at Best Buy for $30. I went to walmart early this morning and they price matched best buy for me.
PS4Deals,2nkfrv,CynicalRaps,2,Thu Nov 27 19:45:42 2014 UTC,How does price match work? Do you have to bring an ad or something (sorry ive never considered price matchign in stores)
PS4Deals,2nkfrv,badmood247,2,Fri Nov 28 16:37:17 2014 UTC,I just bring the item up on my phone on either amazon or best buy.
PS4Deals,2nkfrv,Lolmir,1 point,Fri Nov 28 18:22:08 2014 UTC,39€ @PSN-Store (Europe). US too?
