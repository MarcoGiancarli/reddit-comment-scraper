What makes reddit what it is is irrelevant (That double-word is intended). Ownership determines who gets to set the rules and who is ultimately responsible for what happens there. It is easy for someone who bears no risk of financial loss or responsibility to prevent it to claim that they should be able to do whatever they want with someone else's property. And honestly, reddit jumps through hoops to be hands off. Just consider the subs that are still here. And if they don't like it, they have the freedom to do it somewhere else.

Falwell, 485 U.S. 46 (1988), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held, in a unanimous 8–0 decision (Justice Anthony Kennedy took no part in the consideration or decision of the case), that the First Amendment's free-speech guarantee prohibits awarding damages to public figures to compensate for emotional distress intentionally inflicted upon them.  Thus, Hustler magazine's parody of Jerry Falwell was deemed to be within the law, because the Court found that reasonable people would not have interpreted the parody to contain factual claims, leading to a reversal of the jury verdict in favor of Falwell, who had previously been awarded $150,000 in damages by a lower court.

We shan't split hairs, this is still an awesome photograph, and I hope they make a film about this someday. Hooray Tenzing!"

RedditThroughHistory,32eo25,autowikibot,24,Mon Apr 13 04:17:55 2015 UTC,"Section 3. Wellesley College years of article  Hillary Rodham Clinton:       In 1965, Rodham enrolled at Wellesley College, where she majored in political science.  During her first year, she served as president of the Wellesley Young Republicans;   with this Rockefeller Republican-oriented group,  she supported the elections of Mayor John Lindsay and Senator Edward Brooke.  She later stepped down from this position, as her views changed regarding the American Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War.  In a letter to her youth minister at this time, she described herself as ""a mind conservative and a heart liberal.""  In contrast to the 1960s current that advocated radical actions against the political system, she sought to work for change within it.  In her junior year, Rodham became a supporter of the antiwar presidential nomination campaign of Democrat Eugene McCarthy.  Following the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., Rodham organized a two-day student strike and worked with Wellesley's black students to recruit more black students and faculty.  In early 1968, she was elected president of the Wellesley College Government Association and served through early 1969;   she was instrumental in keeping Wellesley from being embroiled in the student disruptions common to other colleges.  A number of her fellow students thought she might some day become the first female President of the United States.  To help her better understand her changing political views, Professor Alan Schechter assigned Rodham to intern at the House Republican Conference, and she attended the ""Wellesley in Washington"" summer program.  Rodham was invited by moderate New York Republican Representative Charles Goodell to help Governor Nelson Rockefeller's late-entry campaign for the Republican nomination.  Rodham attended the 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami. However, she was upset by the way Richard Nixon's campaign portrayed Rockefeller and by what she perceived as the convention's ""veiled"" racist messages, and left the Republican Party for good.

In a relationship if you both try to be too independent and not ask things of each other, not belong to each other, you will not generate any real affection.

I am sorry that Mr. Gamesh was dissatisfied, but I think we should be allowed to explain our side of the story. Looking through his account tablets shows that he is familiar with our ""customer is always favored by the gods"" policy, because he has complained about every order he has made in the last mu and he has received almost 500 gun of free copper in our attempts to earn and keep his business. This has cost us dearly, and we have to make a choice. We have already had to execute several slaves to keep our personnel costs low, but we have decided, going forward, to not accept any more orders from Mr. Gamesh in the interest of our company and our other clients. We suspect this is what prompted his poor review. We are sorry it has come to this. Please, do not let this stop you from shopping at Garadin & Karadin's Crazy Copper Mine.

If you didn't want to be a party to the execution of slaves, then you had no business getting into the copper mining field in the first place.  My uncle Zimah ran a copper mine of the utmost purity for our lord Gilgamesh for 20 years, and barely a week went by that he didn't feed a slave or more to the lions and asses for bringing him nuggets contaminated with worthless sandstone.  If only brave Zimah's efforts hadn't completely exhausted the many veins of copper there, I wouldn't have to deal with you or your incompetent brother.    I'm not building monuments here!   I'm crafting weapons of war.  If I temper a spearhead of true copper, I expect it smash the skull of a barbarian, pierce his soul, and slide smoothly out as polished and sharp as it went in.  But when men are sent out to sentry with spearheads of Garadin quality copper, they come back after one patrol with a misshapen lump of ash like this.  What kind of quality is that!?"

Crispus Attucks was a symbol for the abolitionists at the time and was portrayed as black in this version.

This comment on a thread about historian's views on GG&S basically sums up my views on it.  In short, he oversimplifies history to the point of absurdity and cuts humanity out entirely in a purely deterministic view thereof."
RedditThroughHistory,2v0mdb,azripah,0,Sat Feb 7 19:42:33 2015 UTC,"Well, I appreciate that that is a better written out response than I usually see.  Still, it's not a point-by-point refutation as it claims to be, because well, there are really a lot of points in the book.  What about, for example, Diamond's argument that agriculture developed faster in Eurasia because it is a continent spread across a great latitudinal distance, rather than across longitude like the Americas?  And I really disagree with this:   To believe the narrative you need to view Native Americans as fundamentally naive, unable to understand Spanish motivations and desires, unable react to new weapons/military tactics, unwilling to accommodate to a changing political landscape, incapable of mounting resistance once conquered, too stupid to invent the key technological advances used against them, and doomed to die because they failed to build cities, domesticate animals and thereby acquire infectious organisms. When viewed through this lens, I hope you can see why so many historians and anthropologists are livid that a popular writer is perpetuating a false interpretation of history while minimizing the agency of entire continents full of people.   Diamond does mention that the Spanish have access to a literate culture which recorded many historical interactions between peoples, and how that could be an advantage.  However, I think that saying ""If Native Americans could not build cities and/or defeat the Europeans, they are inferior"" is in itself a Eurocentric and bigoted opinion.  The value of human culture should not be whether or not it can develop to parallel what Western ideology praises."
RedditThroughHistory,2v0mdb,azripah,2,Sat Feb 7 20:38:38 2015 UTC,"The thing that irritates me most about GG&S though is its deterministic view, whereas the conquest of the Aztec and the Inca was, IMO, a fluke caused by the dumb luck of the conquistadors arriving during the build up to a civil war in the former and a succession crisis in the latter.   It's not as if what the Spanish did was inconceivable to the natives by any means, it's just that they arrived at basically the worst possible time, sowed chaos and took advantage of it. The Inca fielded an organized army of tens of thousands, if they were in a better position they could have easily repulsed the Spanish."

She was the fifteenth and penultimate child of Holy Roman Empress Maria Theresa and Emperor Francis I.  In April 1770, upon her marriage to Louis-Auguste, Dauphin of France, she became Dauphine of France. She assumed the title Queen of France and of Navarre when her husband ascended the throne as Louis XVI upon the death of his grandfather Louis XV in May 1774. After seven years of marriage, she gave birth to a daughter, Marie-Thérèse Charlotte, the first of her four children.  Initially charmed by her personality and beauty, the French people eventually came to dislike her, accusing ""L'Autrichienne"" (which literally means the Austrian (woman), but also suggests the French word ""chienne"", meaning bitch) of being profligate, promiscuous,  and of harbouring sympathies for France's enemies, particularly Austria, her country of origin.  The Diamond Necklace incident damaged her reputation further, although she was completely innocent in this affair. She later became known as Madame Déficit because France's financial crisis was blamed on her lavish spending.

It was quite common until the '50s for Jews who were born in the US or immigrated from non-Yiddish speaking areas to know it simply because it was the language most Jews spoke.  It was even common for non-Jews who lived or worked with Jews to know Yiddish--Louis Armstrong (worked for a Russian Jewish storeowner) and Colin Powell (grew up in the Bronx when it was majority-Jewish) both know Yiddish."

When ye meet those who disbelieve in battle, turn not your backs to them. (16)Whoso on that day turneth his back to them, unless maneuvering for battle or intent to join a company, he truly hath incurred wrath from Allah, and his habitation will be hell, a hapless journey's end.""  I understand the issues, buddy, and the issue at hand is that, yeah, not every Muslim is a psycho, but at the end of the day, they're reading from the same book, following the same teachings and waving the same banner as the people why just shot up a cartoonist's office in France.

It dispels this notion that ""Prophet Muhammad cannot be shown!"", rather the fact that Islam has different interpretations of that command (Shocker!), and that the real issue is Prophet Muhammad not wanting to be worshipped as a new God, much akin to Moses not wanting his followers to begin worshipping false idols."
RedditThroughHistory,2rv2gd,farquier,8,Fri Jan 9 17:08:45 2015 UTC,"My understanding is also that this became a stricter prohibition mainly in the 16th and 17th century among Sunni muslims and the restrictions on figural imagery have generally been weaker in the Shia world. Also, I've tracked down this manuscript; it is a Timurid manuscript of the Miraj-Nama written oddly enough on Chagatai Turkic. A very interesting and spectacularly painted manuscript really."
RedditThroughHistory,2rv2gd,farquier,11,Fri Jan 9 17:22:38 2015 UTC,"Well its Sunni, not Shi'ite. Shi'ite Islam and Iran are really only tied strongly together with the Safavids after 1501 (ignoring the brief Buyid dynasty).   As for its ""prohibition"", it became strong amongst Salafi's and specifically Wahhabi's, both of whom sought a more literal understanding of the Qu'ran, a fundamentalist understanding. This in part translated into depicting Prophet Muhammad becoming a taboo. But as I said, ""Islam"" is just scripture, you can interpret it differently. There is no ""universal"" understanding of it.   There are tons, upon tons of Muhammad depictions by Muslims, I just chose this one, almost at random on google."
RedditThroughHistory,2rv2gd,zombieinferno,5,Fri Jan 9 18:32:46 2015 UTC,"Oh, sorry, I meant those clauses as two separate things-""the prohibition becoming stricter"" and ""it's always been weaker in the Shiite world"". Although the line between ""Shia"", ""Sunni, and ""folk Sufi"" in Iran is kinda blurry even in the Timurid period. Anyhow I just mention the specific manuscript because it turns out that there are actually a lot of scholars who find it very interesting because it's a large cycle of paintings, it has some subjects you don't see much of elsewhere, and because it's not in Persian(and because the illustrations are extremely good). So you actually stumbled upon something pretty cool."
RedditThroughHistory,2rv2gd,zombieinferno,2,Fri Jan 9 18:39:41 2015 UTC,"It's not just a prohibition in the representation of Muhammed. It was strict prohibitions of any graven images of the creations of God. They believed that the creation of living things was unique unto God and that artists would be punished in the afterlife for creating images of living things and therefor trying to be god-like.   The MOMA's statement on this concept wraps it up nicely ""The strongest statements on the subject of figural depiction are made in the Hadith (Traditions of the Prophet), where painters are challenged to ""breathe life"" into their creations and threatened with punishment on the Day of Judgment.""  This however wasn't always the case as it has been pointed out. My personal favorite period of Islamic art is of the Mughals after the 1500s. They meshed the ideals of Indus art and blended it with their own which allowed the creation of some amazing pieces of architecture and imagery. Beautiful stuff and so full of the rich detailed Islamic patterning seen similarly in other regions."

As for your first point, about painters in hell, that is exactly what I meant by a much later ""puritanical"" move within Islam. Early Islamic art is rife with images, heck some of the early Rashidun Caliphs even printed coinage with their faces on them. This idea that the Muslim world has no art with humans or the Prophet Muhammad is a perpetuated lie, that is just the point I was trying to make."
RedditThroughHistory,2rv2gd,cygtfm,3,Fri Jan 9 22:19:09 2015 UTC,"Shit, i'm sorry, it wasn't the MOMA, it was the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Have no idea why I put MOMA instead of Met. Innocent mistake. Sorry!  Also, I meant to point out as well that Islam isn't the only faith to have debates over sacred imagery. Early Buddhist images never showed the Buddha - he was usually shown just as footprints, empty space with a throne or umbrella, the bodhi tree, and the dharma wheel. I seem to also remember him being represented by a lion but I might be thinking of them as a Buddhist symbolism and not a replacement icon for The Buddha."

RedditThroughHistory,2rv2gd,iamtheproposer,1 point,Sun Jan 11 02:35:03 2015 UTC,"Eh, the answer(like many other things) boils down to ""It's complicated"". There are aspects of Islamic tradition that reject images and imagemaking(those hadiths,but also e.g.the skill of the false prophet Mani in depction) but also aspects that support it(the legends in which Heraclius and the last Sasanian kings are miraculously in posession of or are sent images of prophets including Muhammed*, in which the image stands to verify Muhammed's prophecy and his standing in a chain of prophets reaching back to Adam) and aspects that are ambivalent(e.g. treating images on cloth or curtains as a non-issue). Where different groups and patrons fall in this spectrum of opinion ranged a good deal and to some extent cataloging who was stricter about this prohibition is a much less useful exercise than starting from this basic ambivalence and looking and why and how figurative imagery does or does not get used.  *Students of late antiquity will doubtless be reminded by certain of these legends of the Image of Edessa."

RedditThroughHistory,2qy78s,iheartdna,29,Wed Dec 31 20:30:57 2014 UTC,"For this photo, I've always found the truth behind the image to be fascinating.  American photographer, Ruth Orkin, was strolling through Italy with her friend.  They were well aware of the intense stares and cat calls that the pair was receiving , so on this particular street, Ruth actually asked several men to oogle it up for the camera.  She asked her friend to intentionally walk past the prepped and colluding group, shooting her camera as her friend walked down the sidewalk.  Personally, I think that the image is the better for it, but the image brings up some challenging questions about the practice of street photography because the image is an intentional set up.  Is it still a street photo if you've staged it?  This question comes up again and again.  Notably, Jeff Wall challenged us with the same ideas in his staged image, mimic in 1978.  I think that Ruth Orkin was decades ahead of her time, capturing this, American Girl in Italy, all the way back in 1951.    I know that this sub isn't about the actual history of the image, but I thought that someone might appreciate the story."

In many of them he takes full credit for 9/11 and goes into his motives, he wanted people to know what he did and why he did it, he basically wanted the west to think 9/11 was just a warning shot.  It's interesting you say he didn't take credit for it, for most of the last decade, the joke was that he was living in a cave somewhere complete with a full recording studio. It's primarily through these videos that the search for his hiding place was initially being investigated (didn't lead to much). He would release another one every few months at the least.

You didn't grew up with this.  You don't have a whole economy that survives only on the labors of people born to do that work.    And furthermore, who are you to grant rights to creatures who I grew myself.  My plantation has not needed to buy a slave at auction for 3 generations.  Currently, my workforce is a team of 3 males and 2 girls, all of whom only exist because I forced their lazy mom and dad to rut until they gave me a litter of pups strong enough to put to work.  Similarly, that mom and dad have my father to thank for their existence, and so on through to time of my founding great-grand-pappy, with one or two ""loaner negros"" borrowed from neighbors to keep up the hereditary diversity.  Also I have fed my litter every crust of bread and meat they ever saw.  What right have they to claim rights in spite of their creator?!  Does a chicken have a right to cry foul when I hatched it, and I come at with a cleaver to make it my dinner?  Is ""honest Abe"" going to pay me back for all the food I've wasted on these savages?   Is he going to reimburse me for the stables and huts I have constructed to house them?   If they have basic human rights, why didn't they have enough basic human self-reliance to acquire these things for themselves?

It has also pleased our Heavenly Father to favor as well our citizens in their homes as our soldiers in their camps and our sailors on the rivers and seas with unusual health. He has largely augmented our free population by emancipation and by immigration, while He has opened to us new sources of wealth and has crowned the labor of our workingmen in every department of industry with abundant rewards. Moreover, He has been pleased to animate and inspire our minds and hearts with fortitude, courage, and resolution sufficient for the great trial of civil war into which we have been brought by our adherence as a nation to the cause of freedom and humanity, and to afford to us reasonable hopes of an ultimate and happy deliverance from all our dangers and afflictions.  Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do hereby appoint and set apart the last Thursday in November next as a day which I desire to be observed by all my fellow-citizens, wherever they may then be, as a day of thanksgiving and praise to Almighty God, the beneficent Creator and Ruler of the Universe. And I do further recommend to my fellow-citizens aforesaid that on that occasion they do reverently humble themselves in the dust and from thence offer up penitent and fervent prayers and supplications to the Great Disposer of Events for a return of the inestimable blessings of peace, union, and harmony throughout the land which it has pleased Him to assign as a dwelling place for ourselves and for our posterity throughout all generations."

Two weeks ago, it was okay to say in a crowded room that this guy was a burned out alcoholic hippie who is a good songwriter but never made up for the fact that he emotionally abandoned his first son, beat his first wife, and chose to spend half a life with that phony-faced talent vacuum, Yoko Ono.    Ever since this news came out, the world seems to have forgotten all of John Lennon's violence, addiction, and selfishness, and only remembers some kind of ethereal peace and love guru who was operating on a higher inspirational plane than the rest of the world.  People!  He was rich and famous!  He could fly anywhere and do anything and he sat around his apartment smoking weed.  The only reason you think his songs are profound are because you were stoned out of your mind in a perpetual cannabis haze when you first heard him.  John was a hypocrite. He could talk about peace and love to the world but he could never show it to his wife and son.  JL"

It is worth noting though that Hawaii was an American territory at the time having been annexed in 1898.

You just need to be careful not to hang a candle directly below a branch (cause that one might get hot) and have a bucket of water handy, especially if there are children or animals around. And not abandon the room while they are burning, and maybe not everybody get terribly drunk.  It's beautiful. I wouldn't like Christmas without real candles on the tree."

RedditThroughHistory,2od5rf,rrbbkk,3,Fri Dec 5 19:12:54 2014 UTC,"How long do you have your tree up?  Depending on where you live, people in North America will sometimes put a tree up in November and leave it up until a few days after January 1st. If they don't water it carefully, it can become very dry and dangerous.   Also, we tend to use electric lights. It's probably better to go either electric or with candles, but not both, if you want to just keep a bucket of water handy. Localized fires are bad enough and can spread quickly, but electrical fires can spread through and along walls, too, and can be difficult to extinguish. With those, you just want to get out of the house as fast as possible.  I'll bet real candles on a tree are beautiful, though. I'd love to go and see it."

As an anonymous supporter of the Sons of Liberty for many months, I can tell you that what happened last night was a carefully planned covert operation conceived to make the most effective peaceful demonstration possible to show the British government that the Colonial American public will no longer sit idle when it is being held captive to the twin abuses of monopoly and unrepresented taxation.  Do people prepare Indian disguises and peacfully guard against unauthorized import for weeks to participate in a ""massive riot""?  You realize, I assume, that the private ownership of the East India company is a rhetorical fig-leaf that Greedy King George uses to cover up his naked ambition to siphon the new world dry of any property and fortunes we may toil to build up in this harsh frontier.  The crown takes an exorbitant tax of 25% of every case of East India Company tea traded within its empire AND, to make its own outrageous price gouging more profitable, His Majesty has arbitrarily outlawed the import of all Dutch tea to the colonies (which has no tax of any kind).  This sweetheart deal give EIC a monopoly in anyone's eyes and makes them partners in greed with the crown and all its several toadies. So forgive me if I feel their tea shipment is not a simple matter of private property.  A riot is an arbitrary act of violence and destruction perpetrated by a mob of degenerates out of control.  The Tea Party was a valiant act of defiance against an unchecked dictator.  Did you know that tea taxes are paid to the crown by importers the instant the product is unloaded safely on land?  When the Sons of Liberty began its peaceful protest, many ships immediately turned around and sailed East.  Others stayed, hoping to wait out the protest and drop off their aromatic tax burdons.  Before things grew to a violent conflict, our protestors choose to sneak aboard and dump the offending property into the sea, rather than see it become a basis for unfair taxation, or a grudge over which violence would develop.  This morning, the Massachusetts Gazette reported that a broken padlock, the personal property of one of the ships’ captains, was replaced.   Please be more careful with your accusations in the future, sir.  A free and accurate press is the only weapon civilized man has against the tyranny of ignorance.  -Publius"

While an absentmindedness is acceptable and proper in a gentleman scholar a maid should be conscientious to a fault. There are no weighty or pressing matters that affect their minds, and their duties to their masters and their masters household are the only responsibilities they bear.   It is unacceptable. Hopefully this lack of appropriateness will not put medical science too far behind.    Reprimand her and move on good sir. If the behavior is persistent and unchanging replace her and move on.

From Googling the headline (""Most valuable photograph ever taken"") I was able to find this issue is from June 14, 1936. This is right before the 1936 Summer Olympics being hosted by Hitler in Berlin. Based on this I'm going to say it is most likely Hitler. The only film made by Charlie Chaplin this year was Modern Times, which came out in February, so it's unlikely there would be a major story about it in June.   Or there is an unfortunate dark spot on some random guy's picture that looks like a Hitler-stache."

He was arrested, confessed under torture to a range of anti-Soviet activity, and was executed in 1940. By the beginning of World War II, his status within the Soviet Union became that of a political unperson.

And some don't think Catholics are Christians because they haven't prayed the ""sinner's prayer"", (something that was never part of Christianity until recently I might add).

How do you reconcile the fact that your particular brand of Christianity didn't develop until 1,500 years after Christ lived? And you can't say that, ""Oh, we're all Christians so it doesn't matter."" If you seriously look at different denominations, the disagreements go much deeper than simple matters. Does baptism save you or not? Do you have to pray a prayer to be accepted into heaven? Do infants go to heaven? You obviously have your answer to these questions, but why are you right and everyone else is wrong?  You also can't say that this is how Christianity was originally practiced. It just wasn't. I'm not saying the Catholics are any more correct, but Martin Luther did not ""reform"" the church to its former status. Read your history. It's not on your side. Martin Luther changed the church, he didn't restore anything. Period. So, how on earth do you deal with this?"

That looks like something you just picked out at Clothier John Saunders, like some common farm-hand with a couple of shillings to spare.  Every gentleman knows that to get proper attire put together, you go to Savile Row to have your measures taken, and have it tailored to fit. (I personally prefer Henry Toole's handwork myself, but opinion might vary. I just find that Toole does a superior pair of trousers that allows for some movement, i.e. mounting ones horse without tearing a seam.)  The price difference might be a florin or two, but in my opinion it is well worth it. Do not skimp your shillings when you buy clothes, my boy. It is not seemly for a gentleman to be seen wearing the cheapest outfit he can put together in a certain style, and the inferior quality of the seam is blatant to the discerning eye."

Some of the largest modern Ferris wheels have cars mounted on the outside of the rim, with electric motors to independently rotate each car to keep it upright. These wheels are sometimes referred to as observation wheels, and their cars referred to as capsules, however these alternative names are also sometimes used for wheels with conventional gravity-oriented cars.  The original Ferris Wheel was designed and constructed by George Washington Gale Ferris, Jr. as a landmark for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The term Ferris wheel is used generically for all such structures, which are now the most common type of carnival ride at state fairs in the US.

In 18th century France, the Enlightenment was more popular than women of questionable virtues at dockside pubs. Then the French decided the best way of spreading their enlightened principles was via the guillotine. For a while, it seemed like being French was synonymous with being guillotined. Prodded on by Maximilien François Marie Isidore de Robespierre, a name one can't say with a straight face, the French ""Reign of Terror"" spread and beheadings became a popular spectator sport. They enlightenedly guillotined their King, they enlightenedly guillotined their probably innocent queen and, in a fit of real enlightenment, they finally, and ironically, guillotined Maximilien François Marie Isidore de Robespierre.  No one, I say no one, does drama quite like the French."

After the Roman civil war (Sulla vs. Marius), sulla was the on in power and declared Dictator for Life.  His first order of business was to get rid of any of the remaining followers of Marius.  There were too many, so Sulla outsourced the problem.  He would have a list made of anyone suspected to be a Marian supporter posted at the forum every morning and a reward of 1 gold talent (a lot of money) was given for any who brought the person in, preferably dead.  Their properties were also siezed.  Soon people were informing on their rivals and the state were going after rich men just to fill the treasury, which was low after the civil war.  People would check the list in the morning to see who they could cash in, sometimes they would find themselves, since the state wanted to seize their property or a rival wanted you gone.  One man, reportedly found his name on the list and declared ""woe is me, for I have been informed upon by my alban farm."" Before he was also siezes and killes."

It was the evolution of a prototype called the SCAMP (Special Computer APL Machine Portable) that was developed at the IBM Palo Alto Scientific Center in 1973. In January 1978 IBM announced the IBM 5110, its larger cousin, and in February 1980 IBM announced the IBM 5120. The 5100 was withdrawn in March 1982.  When the IBM PC was introduced in 1981, it was originally designated as the IBM 5150, putting it in the ""5100"" series, though its architecture was not directly descended from the IBM 5100.

It may, perhaps, be suspected, that my Instrument might have suffered since the first Experiment was made, (as it is well known the best are liable to Damage by Time and frequent Use) but that was not the Case; for tho' mine had, I must confess, been often used, yet it was with such prudent Care and Caution, that it was in as great Perfection as ever; and even at this Day I could venture to recommend it as a tolerable good one, tho' I have had it above these 30 Years, and used it pretty freely, and with great Satisfaction to myself and others."

Head over to /r/homebrewing for help.  But here's the quick nitty gritty of it:  Get some malt extract from your local general goods store. This is for ""baking"" purposes, but have you ever seen anyone bake with it? Most of them already have hops added, but legally they would draw attention to themselves if they announced this on the label. If you want that fresh hop taste, it's a bine and you can grow it in your backyard. If any coppers come asking, just tell them it's a noxious weed you've been trying to get rid of.  Boil the extract in 5 gallons of water (adding fresh hops if you so please). Hops at 60 minutes provide bitterness. 15 minutes and less add aroma and flavor. Chill the liquid to around 50F. Now you pitch the yeast. You can get this in the baking section of the same general goods store. Actual brewer's yeast from commercial beer is best, but they're hard to come by these days. Cover and store the beer in a cool dark place (preferably a secret area in your basement or cellar) for several weeks to months.  Presto, bamo! You've got flat beer!  Now get some empty brown bottles, fill them with the beer and a little bit more sugar. Store them for a few more weeks and you're good to go.  If you want specific recipes, many of the syrup extract kits have recipe books they will send you in an unmarked brown envelope if you write to them. Discretion is important in this market."

RedditThroughHistory,2fyafl,autowikibot,2,Thu Sep 11 00:24:54 2014 UTC,"Colosseum:       The Colosseum or Coliseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium; Italian: Anfiteatro Flavio or Colosseo) is an elliptical amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy. Built of concrete and stone,  it was the largest amphitheatre of the Roman Empire, and is considered one of the greatest works of Roman architecture and engineering. It is the largest amphitheatre in the world.   The Colosseum is situated just east of the Roman Forum. Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in 70 AD,  and was completed in 80 AD under his successor and heir Titus.  Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (81–96).  These three emperors are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named in Latin for its association with their family name (Flavius).  The Colosseum could hold, it is estimated, between 50,000 and 80,000 spectators,   and was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles such as mock sea battles, animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Classical mythology. The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era. It was later reused for such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian shrine.

RedditThroughHistory,2fqdj7,TheThingsIThink,2,Sun Sep 7 21:35:33 2014 UTC,"Battle of Plassey:       The Battle of Plassey was a decisive victory of the British East India Company over the Nawab of Bengal and his French  allies on 23 June 1757. The battle established the Company rule in Bengal which expanded over much of India for the next hundred years. The battle took place at Plassey (anglicized version of Palashi) on the banks of the Bhagirathi River, about 150 km north of Calcutta and south of Murshidabad, then capital of Bengal (now in Nadia district in West Bengal). The belligerents were Nawab Siraj-ud-daulah, the last independent Nawab of Bengal, and the British East India Company. When Alivardhi Khan died in 1756, Siraj-ud-daulah became the nawab of Bengal. He ordered the English to stop the extension of their fortification. Robert Clive bribed Mir Jafar, the commander in chief of the nawab's army, and attacked Calcutta. He defeated the Nawab at Plassey in 1757 and captured Calcutta.  The battle was preceded by the attack on British-controlled Calcutta by Nawab Siraj-ud-daulah and the Black Hole incident. The British sent reinforcements under Colonel Robert Clive and Admiral Charles Watson from Madras to Bengal and recaptured Calcutta. Clive then seized the initiative to capture the French fort of Chandernagar. Tensions and suspicions between Siraj-ud-daulah and the British culminated in the Battle of Plassey. The battle was waged during the Seven Years' War (1756–63), and, in a mirror of their European rivalry, the French East India Company (La Compagnie des Indes Orientales)  sent a small contingent to fight against the British. Siraj-ud-Daulah had a numerically superior force and made his stand at Plassey. The British, worried about being outnumbered, formed a conspiracy with Siraj-ud-Daulah's demoted army chief Mir Jafar, along with others such as Yar Lutuf Khan, Jagat Seths (Mahtab Chand and Swarup Chand), Omichund and Rai Durlabh. Mir Jafar, Rai Durlabh and Yar Lutuf Khan thus assembled their troops near the battlefield but made no move to actually join the battle. Siraj-ud-Daulah's army was defeated by roughly 3,000 soldiers of Col. Robert Clive, owing to the flight of Siraj-ud-daulah from the battlefield and the inactivity of the conspirators.  This is judged to be one of the pivotal battles in the control of Indian subcontinent by the colonial powers. The British now wielded enormous influence over the Nawab and consequently acquired large amounts of concession for previous losses and revenue from trade. The British further used this revenue to increase their military might and push the other European colonial powers such as the Dutch and the French out of South Asia, thus expanding the British Empire in Asia.

It was considered a vice and known to be addictive. In the 1500s or so it was considered medicinal but by the 1600s people already began to know about it being harmful. King James I said tobacco smoking was ""a custome lothsome to the eye, hatefull to the Nose, harmefull to the braine, dangerous to the Lungs, and in the blacke stinking fume thereof, neerest resembling the horrible Stigian smoke of the pit that is bottomelesse."" The Ottomons also thoguht it was medicinal at first but realised it wasn't even quicker than Europeans and there are Ottomon medical texts which talk abotu it dulling the senses and causing fatigue (which we now know to be true). Tobacco has even been outlawed at various times, sometimes because of it beign a vice, sometimes because of health risks and often both. Smoking has even been made punishable by death a few times.   As to why it has endured it is because it is addictive, profitable to merchants/business, is pleasureable sometimes and has often been considered cool/rebellious or trendy throughout history."

We're not ISIS you know, all you'll get is a ""ciao, bella"".   Social interactions are so different in Rome and southern Italy. Is cultural relativity only a thing for non-white people, because we have a profoundly different culture in meridional Italy to the USA? I've known countless couples who met because the guy chatted her up on the street or in the metro. Conversely I know nobody, male or female, who would dare interact with a stranger on the Underground in London (nor would I be likely to, to be fair).   Why do you say ""attention""?

Tobacco was recognised as a medicine soon after it was first imported from the New World, and tobacco smoke was used by western medical practitioners as a tool against cold and drowsiness, but applying it by enema was a technique appropriated from the North American Indians. The procedure was used to treat gut pain, and attempts were often made to resuscitate victims of near drowning. Liquid tobacco enemas were often given to ease the symptoms of a hernia.  During the early 19th century the practice fell into decline, when it was discovered that the principal active agent in tobacco smoke, nicotine, is poisonous.

RedditThroughHistory,2bmg98,MrDeckard,2,Fri Jul 25 03:57:47 2014 UTC,"You seem confused.   Typically, this sub has headlines that apply to current events, but are actually referring to historical stuff.  What is the relevant current event here?"
RedditThroughHistory,2bmg98,Bayoris,10,Fri Jul 25 04:19:42 2014 UTC,Coming to OP's defense here.  That is only one class of submission to this sub.  Most of the headlines on the front page right now do not adhere to this formula.

RedditThroughHistory,2bmg98,BigRedS,3,Fri Jul 25 13:05:49 2014 UTC,Perhaps; it used to seem more normal to have apparently arbitrary events where the joke would be in the ensuing comments. Perhaps it just seemed that way because I didn't get so many of the current events being referred to...

Perhaps after I've submitted to this sub several hundred times like you have I'll gain a deeper and more nuanced perspective on what's expected.  Until then (with your permission of course) I'm going to stick with the this day in history format that I have been employing.  I do so look forward to your helpful constructive criticism.  As a seasoned reddit mentor as the official arbiter of quality posts in this sub I am simply delighted to have drawn your attention with my humble efforts.  I only hope that one day with your gentle guidance I can become even half the redditor you are.
RedditThroughHistory,2bmg98,jakielim,7,Fri Jul 25 04:41:42 2014 UTC,"Dude, I'm legitimately trying to be chill here.  Don't know where all this hostility is coming from.  The basic idea behind the sub is typically taking a historical event that could have a similar headline to something happening today, and post that.  For instance, if you were to post ""Russia threatening to expand into Eastern Europe"", an obvious reference to the encroachment on Ukraine, but the link is to a story aboout the expansion of the Soviet Union, that would be a good post.  You have just posted a picture of a thing that happened in the past on this date.  We have a subreddit for that.  It's called /r/thisdayinhistory.  Again, I don't know why you're being hostile.  It just seems like you didn't understand what this sub was for.  It's supposed to be clever title jokes.  There was no joke here."

Yes I saw that some people match it to something current... but I also saw that many people don't. More of a stylistic development than a ""supposed to be for"".  I chose to do all of my posts so far here based on this day in history news because that seemed to conform to the posting guidelines as long as I'm talking about it as if it was current news.  And my reply wasn't hostile, it was sardonic.  You know... on account of you being a wanker and all.  Because, how I see it... I've carefully studied the guidelines. I've been posting here.  You clearly didn't. And you haven't been.  You can be as chill as you like, but heres the deal...  If I'm actually doing it wrong I'm sure one of the seven mods on this sub will tell me.  So what I'm trying to say here is:  ""ahhh go peddle yer papers.""  ""scram""  ""get lost""  ""go fly a kite""  or perhaps... go be a fake moderator on some other sub where you don't actually post... or to somebody who (not to put too fine a point on it) gives a rats ass what you think."

RedditThroughHistory,2ad69n,autowikibot,1 point,Fri Jul 11 11:00:46 2014 UTC,"Hitler:       Adolf Hitler (German: [ˈadɔlf ˈhɪtlɐ] ; 20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945) was an Austrian-born German politician and the leader of the Nazi Party (German: Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP); National Socialist German Workers Party). He was chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945 and dictator of Nazi Germany (as Führer und Reichskanzler) from 1934 to 1945. Hitler was at the centre of Nazi Germany, World War II in Europe, and the Holocaust.  Hitler was a decorated veteran of World War I. He joined the German Workers' Party (precursor of the NSDAP) in 1919, and became leader of the NSDAP in 1921. In 1923, he attempted a coup in Munich to seize power. The failed coup resulted in Hitler's imprisonment, during which time he wrote his memoir, Mein Kampf (My Struggle). After his release in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting Pan-Germanism, antisemitism, and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. Hitler frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as being part of a Jewish conspiracy.  Hitler's Nazi Party became the largest democratically elected party in the German Reichstag, leading to his appointment as chancellor in 1933. Following fresh elections won by his coalition, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act, which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into the Third Reich, a single-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of National Socialism. Hitler aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a New Order to counter what he saw as the injustice of the post-World War I international order dominated by Britain and France. His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, the denunciation of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I, and the annexation of territories that were home to millions of ethnic Germans, actions which gave him significant popular support.  Hitler actively sought Lebensraum (""living space"") for the German people. His aggressive foreign policy is considered to be the primary cause of the outbreak of World War II in Europe. He directed large-scale rearmament and on 1 September 1939 invaded Poland, resulting in British and French declarations of war on Germany. In June 1941, Hitler ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union. By the end of 1941 German forces and their European allies occupied most of Europe and North Africa. Failure to defeat the Soviets and the entry of the United States into the war forced Germany onto the defensive and it suffered a series of escalating defeats, partly because of Hitler's countless military blunders. In the final days of the war, during the Battle of Berlin in 1945, Hitler married his long-time lover, Eva Braun. On 30 April 1945, less than two days later, the two committed suicide to avoid capture by the Red Army, and their corpses were burned. Under Hitler's leadership and racially motivated ideology, the regime was responsible for the genocide of at least 5.5 million Jews, and millions of other victims whom he and his followers deemed racially inferior.

This war followed the First Indochina War and was fought between North Vietnam—supported by the Soviet Union, China and other communist allies—and the government of South Vietnam—supported by the United States and other anti-communist allies.  The Viet Cong (also known as the National Liberation Front, or NLF), a lightly armed South Vietnamese communist common front aided by the North, fought a guerrilla war against anti-communist forces in the region. The People's Army of Vietnam (aka the North Vietnamese Army) engaged in a more conventional war, at times committing large units into battle.

King Frederik also arranged for the monograms of visits from earlier monarchs to be recorded as well.

I'm German. I'm a football fan with all my heart. I'm really looking forward to the game on Thursday. I'm already afraid of all the WWII jokes and puns on /r/soccer.   The game on Thursday has nothing to do with '44. Just look at the diversity in the German team. Players with Polish, Ghanaian, Tunisian or Turkish roots playing for Germany playing against the team of a country we are friends with which has a German manager who used to be our own manager. This would not have remotely been possible in '44.   It is important to remember the past. It is important to remember what went wrong. There's a time for that. The match on Thursday is not the time.   Football is not about politics. Football is about competitive rivalry and good natured banter. Let's keep it like that.

At the same time, I think there is still a place for this kind of humor, especially in a subreddit dedicated to drawing ironic parallels between historical events and the present.  If anything, this post does a nice job of putting into perspective the fact that seventy years after Germans and Americans were slaughtering each other on the beaches of Normandy, we can all come together and enjoy each others company while watching our respective teams in friendly competition on the football field."

Simpson's arrest, any plans for producing the series were canceled. The completed film, the dailies, production reports, scripts and all other paperwork were confiscated by the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office and examined during the course of the murder investigation. It was argued, at one point, that O J. Simpson's training for his character as a Navy S.E.A.L. in Frogmen, might have facilitated his ability to commit the murders. After Simpson's acquittal in 1995, the film remained (then and to this day) confiscated in the property of the Los Angeles Police Department."

The most damage from a nuclear blast doesn't come from the fireball or from the radiation, but from the blast wave. No, the desks aren't going to protect you if you're within the fireball radius, but it would help if you are in the blast radius. In this case, ducking under a desk would work if there is falling debris. Same reason they have drills for kids to duck under desks in the case of earthquakes or tornadoes."

It is one of the most influential films of the German Expressionist movement and is often considered to be one of the greatest horror films of the silent era in film.  The film used stylized sets, with abstract, jagged buildings painted on canvas backdrops and flats. To add to this strange style, the actors used an unrealistic technique that exhibited ""jerky"" and dance-like movements.  This film is cited as having introduced the 'twist' ending in cinema.  The premiere of a digitally restored version of the film took place at the 64th Berlin International Film Festival in February 2014.

At the time of the ""Peace in our time"" treaty the western powers (Britain in particular) were not ready for a war with Germany. Following the demilitarization that occurred after WWI, Germany started to rearm much sooner and had a large lead over Britain, France and Russia. The British eventually realized what was going on and started rebuilding their army and fleet but were several years from completion.  If the West had gone to war with Germany at that time they would have almost certainly lost. By accepting a bad deal, Chamberlain bought the West much needed time to prepare."

It's possible that the story was just a fable created to warn man of the danger of his fully realized nature.  then again, Troy was also considered a fable until they found its remains in modern Turkey.   my guess is that the richat structure is a landlocked volcanic hotspot much like iceland or the hawaiian islands. considering that there are two more craters north by north west of it in almost a line.  Or maybe maybe it's both? The sahara was sea and then marshland at one point. considering that the tale is ancient, as told by plato, as told to him from his teacher, as passed from Solon, as told to Solon by the Egyptians. It's possible that once it was a volcano, then eroded over millennia, and used as a city, until there was another natural disaster. See also: the 1500 BC tsunami caused by the santorini erruption that wiped out minoan cities on the isle of crete.  We have no record of these things other than what was transcribed after thousands of years of oral transference. Problem is with stories is that they take on the life of the person that tells them.  There's nothing recorded. All we can guess is by what we can find through archeological & geographic surveys coupled by knowledge of the people at the time.   It would be interesting to find out.

The story of Noah (or Gilgamesh, for that matter) is still a legend even if ""inspired by true events""    See also: the 1500 BC tsunami caused by the santorini erruption that wiped out minoan cities on the isle of crete.

These wretched conspirators had a great number of order-cards printed, admitting “bearer and friends” to the White Tower, on the 1st day of April, to witness, if they so listed, the famous grand annual ceremony of washing the lions. I am sorry to say that I was over-easily prevailed upon to join in the distribution of these favours among friends and acquaintances.  We went to Tower Hill in the morning of the 1st of April—to watch the result. I must confess I, for one, was not prepared for the extraordinary credulity of the British Public. They flocked up in shoals to see the lions washed. The “warders” were almost at their wits’ end. They had the bits of pasteboard flourished in their faces, with angry gestures and angrier imprecations, by the indignant crowd of sight-seers and seekers. I verily believe there was a notion at one time of the day to send for reinforcements of the garrison, so threatening was the aspect of the B.P. raging at the gates of the old City fortress. In the midst of the turmoil some one spotted me to whom I had given an order of admission, and he would have set the whole mob upon me, but I most luckily succeeded in securing the friendly shelter of a cab, which I made drive off instanter from the field of action, knowing of old that discretion is, as a rule, the better part of valour.

RedditThroughHistory,21y0bw,messingaroudwiththec,3,Tue Apr 1 23:46:09 2014 UTC,"It is not only in Britain that spring, this year, has taken everyone by surprise. Here in the Ticino, on the borders of Switzerland and Italy, the slopes overlooking Lake Lugano have already burst into flower at least a fortnight earlier than usual.  But what, you may ask, has the early and welcome arrival of bees and blossom to do with food? Well, it is simply that the past winter, one of the mildest in living memory, has had its effect in other ways as well. Most important of all, it's resulted in an exceptionally heavy spaghetti crop.  The last two weeks of March are an anxious time for the spaghetti farmer. There is always the chance of a late frost which, while not entirely ruining the crop, generally impairs the flavour and makes it difficult for him to obtain top prices in world markets. But now these dangers are over and the spaghetti harvest goes forward.  Spaghetti cultivation here in Switzerland is not, of course, carried out on anything like the tremendous scale of the Italian industry. Many of you, I am sure, will have seen pictures of the vast spaghetti plantations in the Po valley. For the Swiss, however, it tends to be more of a family affair.  Another reason why this may be a bumper year lies in the virtual disappearance of the spaghetti weevil, the tiny creature whose depradations have caused much concern in the past.  After picking, the spaghetti is laid out to dry in the warm Alpine air. Many people are very puzzled by the fact that spaghetti is produced in such uniform lengths. This is the result of many years of patient endeavour by plant breeders who suceeded in producing the perfect spaghetti.  Now the harvest is marked by a traditional meal. Toasts to the new crop are drunk in these boccalinos, then the waiters enter bearing the ceremonial dish. This is, of course, spaghetti -- picked early in the day, dried in the sun, and so brought fresh from garden to table at the very peak of condition. For those who love this dish, there is nothing like real home-grown spaghetti."

Here we see some men engaging in a ""sit in"". These men were part of an organized movement that had clear goals, proven tactics, and above all real leadership. What did OWS have?  ... crickets  OWS was a joke. Talk to any random ""member"" of the ""movement"" and ask them what they were protesting for and you will hear a different answer. Some wanted the banks held to account for the 2008 crash. Some wanted the end of ""corporate monopolies"". Some wanted a tax-code that didn't favor the wealthy. Some wanted money out of politics. But just as many wanted to legalize marijuana, or make a national Bob Marley holiday, or eliminate the Electoral College, or insist the government reveal our ties to the aliens we captured in Roswell, or demand the creation of the Back to the Future hover-boards. Everybody brought their own pet-issue to the ""cause"" so there was no focus.  This was all a result of the fact that there was no leadership. Yes, they saw that as a strength. It was a true ""direct democracy"" movement a bunch of first year college students thought was unique awesome. It was neither. With no leadership there was no focus but also, with no leadership there was no one for the authorities to negotiate with! What's the point of a movement if you have no way of discussing your objectives and goals with your supposed enemies? How does your movement ever expect to have a successful ending if you can't even negotiate an ending?!  On the other hand the Civil Rights movement, as demonstrated in this picture, knew what it was doing. Their victories were clear and tangible and anyone who fought for them can hold their heads high. We celebrate those folk to this day, honoring many of its members with memorials, statues, a library's worth of biographies, and more. The reason for that is that they won!   They were successful because they were smart, and dedicated, and knew a thing or two about history and the law. The OWS movement was a complete disaster, a joke of epic proportions, and to this day I have no idea what the fuck they ever hoped to accomplish. I'm just glad that they've finally gone the way of the dodo and I hope that the next time Americans become outraged enough to camp in a park in record numbers that they channel their energy into affecting real, positive change rather than just taking a little holiday and whine about being harassed by ""the man""."

The leadership of the movement chose Rosa Parks over the the unwed pregnant teen who was the ""Rosa Parks"" before Rosa Parks because Parks was great symbol and made for a great narrative.  Here's the essay I (probably crappily) cribbed this stuff from, which also includes other instances where it was due to a dedicated organization that really got things off the ground."

In 1955, she was the first person arrested for resisting bus segregation in Montgomery, Alabama, preceding the better known Rosa Parks incident by nine months.  She was among the five women originally included in the federal court case, filed on February 1, 1956 as Browder v. Gayle (1956), and testified before the three-judge panel that heard the case in the United States District Court. On June 13, 1956, the judges determined that the state and local laws requiring bus segregation in Alabama were unconstitutional. The case went to the United States Supreme Court, which upheld their ruling on December 17, 1956. Three days later, the Supreme Court issued an order to Montgomery and the state to end bus segregation in Alabama.  For a long time, Montgomery's black leaders did not publicize Colvin's pioneering effort because she was a teenager and became pregnant while unmarried. Given the social norms of the time and her youth, the NAACP leaders worried about using her to represent their movement.

One rises to the top, eventually. Why only that one? What made it different from all the others? They were all, essentially, linking to the exact same thing so why did one end up with +3k upvotes and the rest, some that had even been posted earlier, end up with just one or two votes?  Timing. Luck. And, yes, no little amount of skill.  I hate it when Parks' legacy is diminished or scoffed at by people who point out she wasn't the first. Of course she wasn't. And yes, popular history does tend to glamorize its heroes over time. But while Parks may not have been the first she was the first spark to create the boycott that really made a difference.  You're right, though: the NAACP played their cards well. They knew what they were doing. Going back to the reddit breaking news post example, they knew how to reach their intended audience: with an attractive, ""above-board"" type woman who was ready and willing to become the face of a movement. The OWS ""movement"", on the other hand, didn't even know what game they were playing. The best they could ever do was throw down an ace of spades and say, ""Full house!"" while the world stared at them and wondered why they were making poker references in a euchre game."

He was a man of learning, becoming the chief librarian at the Library of Alexandria. He invented the discipline of geography, including the terminology used today.   He is best known for being the first person to calculate the circumference of the earth, which he did by applying a measuring system using stades, or the length of stadiums during that time period. His calculation was remarkably accurate. He was also the first to calculate the tilt of the Earth’s axis (again with remarkable accuracy). Additionally, he may have accurately calculated the distance from the earth to the sun and invented the leap day.  He created the first map of the world incorporating parallels and meridians, based on the available geographical knowledge of the era.  Eratosthenes was the founder of scientific chronology; he endeavored to revise the dates of the chief literary and political events from the conquest of Troy. In number theory, he introduced the sieve of Eratosthenes, an efficient method of identifying prime numbers.

However, I understand the general point of your diatribe, even if I do not know about this ""redfem"" movement. Unfortunately, I have to wholeheartedly disagree with you, sir. Even with the wonders of to-day like Edison's incandescent lamp and our railroad networks, it is distressing how many people are still socially backwards and trivialize the racism inherent in American society.  I have not seen any persons insulting a white man, and I do believe that those of European origins are more advantaged in life. I have heard that this is because of superior genetics or society, but I do not know for sure. You, sir, seem to think that these negroes are in a fine social condition, but they are less advantaged than the white populace. Perhaps this is because of the inherent superiority of whites?  Call me a suffragist or a carpetbagger, but I strongly support equal rights for all men regardless of genetic predispositions. The horrors of the South to the negro is almost indescribable in words. Why, what of these ""Jim Crow"" laws? The negroes are equal de jure, but de facto their lives and freedoms did not improve much after the war.   Even if some of these ""SJWs"", whoever they are, criticize whites in an idiotic manner, the oppression endured by negroes, especially in the South, must not be ignored. You seem to be trying to trivialize the suffragists (judging from your participation in a forum named ""MensRights"") and the negroes' plight. While negroes and women, according to prevalent thinking, may be inferior to whites, it is clear that these groups are disadvantaged and should be helped to-day."
RedditThroughHistory,20i6jv,autowikibot,-9,Sun Mar 16 03:09:54 2014 UTC,"Unfortunately, I have to wholeheartedly disagree with you, sir.   Okay, about what exactly?    it is distressing how many people are still socially backwards and trivialize the racism inherent in American society.   Well I don't disagree with this statement. What do you wholeheartedly disagree with me about though?   I have not seen any persons insulting a white man   I've never seen anyone fuck a donkey. I'm sure it happens, but like racism against whites that wasn't the point I was making. Still though, I'm curious what you disagree with me about.   and I do believe that those of European origins are more advantaged in life.   You can say privileged, the word existed. It shouldn't ruin your elaborate karma-farming RP.    You, sir, seem to think that these negroes are in a fine social condition   Oh? And what exactly led you to that? Your Us vs. Them mentality? I've already stated I agree with the pic, but don't let me stop you from making your baseless assumptions.    but they are less advantaged than the white populace.   Yeah yeah yeah, but what is it that you disagree with me about? Are you ever going to get to that?

Call me a suffragist or a carpetbagger   I don't take orders from you.    but I strongly support equal rights for all men regardless of genetic predispositions   So why are you replying to me? My comment was solely about how people exist that see it as true when viewed one way, but not another, even though it would still be the exact same thing. Is judging people based on their skin color and actions of others with that same skin color not always wrong? I think it is, but I also think it's funny that there's people out there who go through great lengths to say it isn't.   Even if some of these ""SJWs"", whoever they are, criticize whites in an idiotic manner, the oppression endured by negroes, especially in the South, must not be ignored.   When did I say it should be ignored? Oh that's right, I didn't. You seem to be under the impression that mocking some of the beliefs of SJWs means I'm somehow in favor of slavery and racism, or that what happened to these people doesn't matter. Such a pathetically common strawman...   You seem to be trying to trivialize the suffragists (judging from your participation in a forum named ""MensRights"") and the negroes' plight.   How cute! Did /u/User_History_Spy also tell you that's one of the largest subreddits where you can actually talk about gender-based issues without being censored--and that ""Omg look! Women can be evil too"" bullshit posts aside--there's a lot of legitimate concerns worth talking about as well? Did it tell you, that while I've participated there over the last year or so quite a bit, that I've also sat at the bottom of the page in negatives many times for going against the grain, talking shit about the submission quality, and calling their circlejerks out? Nah probably not, but hey, who cares anyway since you know where ~5% of my comment karma came from and all the need-to-know propaganda to judge me for it!   While negroes and women, according to prevalent thinking, may be inferior to whites   Some people are just assholes. Like my sister! My nephew is 3 and I've already devised a bunch of ways so in the not-so-distant future I can use to help show him how fucked up and wrong his racist mother's beliefs are.     it is clear that these groups are disadvantaged and should be helped to-day.    I absolutely agree. I call them the poor though since the wealthy tend to be corrupt they all need help, and it doesn't matter what color dick the money is wielding, it wants poor mouths around it also regardless of the color. I also believe in this radical notion that people are equal, so that no matter how the races were organized in the picture, the picture would remain equally true...unlike the people I was taking a shot at because I was bored.  If you mustered up the strength to make it this far, by all means, please reply and tell me what it was I said that you disagreed with. You never did get around to that... Either way, good day and thanks for letting my kill some time for dinner."
