Nissan,3e502u,asbestos_fingers,5,Wed Jul 22 00:31:10 2015 UTC,"It looks like an international derivative of the Sentra, possibly a Bluebird/Slyphy.   Look at the 2003-2005 version in this page.   Different wheels, looks like your pic might be a different trim level.   But looks mostly stock.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Sylphy  Edit:  to the people that are downvoting me, the model I mentioned is the successor to the Pulsar.  I am giving the same basic answer as the top but you aren't bothering to look at my link.    Jeez"

Between the different names and model codes, its' a clusterfudge. Even weirder is the EU market's different name, and the fact Australia got two of the same cars with a really different look unless you look really really hard or just know.  As it happens OP replied and said its in Australia, so we can be pretty sure that asbestos_fingers' (earlier) comment is probably right. Idk but I assume there's the same name confusion as with the hatch N15 being Pulsar and Almera....  Btw /r/Nissan/... It's really weird to see someone give a the name of my car to ""another car"". I got over that feeling though lol.  edit; regarding wikipedia, the code N16 S2 pops up. I wonder what the story of that is."

Nissan,3dzm1f,PlainOlCheerios,5,Mon Jul 20 20:36:49 2015 UTC,"Really depends on your budget as far as what you want to do. It will run off of the DE ecu, sensors, injectors and MAF if you just want it running. But you won't get the full potential. There are numerous ecu options out there from jwt to chipping the stock to full standalone just depends on what you want to spend."

Well, honestly, just getting the car running will be nice right now haha. My DE is toast right now, but while working on swap I might as well do a little bit more work. I might have a few hundred extra $$ after buying the VE and possible $$ set aside for labor for lifting the engine, etc.     What would you recommend if you had , say, $300-500 leftover after purchase of the VE itself?"
Nissan,3dzm1f,bradskibill,4,Mon Jul 20 22:10:36 2015 UTC,"Sometimes on forums like www.sr20-forum.com or www.g20.net someone is selling one, just have to get one tuned for what you're running. Jwt has lots of different tunes and used ones run in your ball park. If you go that route you'd need one for a VE, 370 injectors, and what ever MAF you decide to run. Nismotronics is another option in that range. I'm not super familiar with all the current options, but some searching on those forums should yield good results."
Nissan,3dzm1f,PolaroidOfAPolarBear,3,Mon Jul 20 22:39:36 2015 UTC,I want to do the same with my Primera P11. Any help from people who already did this would be awesome!
Nissan,3dzm1f,a-townie,2,Mon Jul 20 21:04:53 2015 UTC,"Friends and I have done this 3 or 4 times now, though never in a G20. If you're running OBDI its really easy. Get the ECU chipped, or purchase a realtime board (such as Nismotronic or Nistune), and run whatever configuration you'd like. Keep the VE injectors, and try to find an N60 MAF if you can spare the change for one (and a pig tail). The distributor tends to be the trickiest part, as its about the only thing that needs rewired. We've done both; keeping the SR20DE dizzy and keeping the SR20VE dizzy. I think its easier to keep the DE dizzy setup. Lots of potential in those engines. Pretty much all of the information you will need will be on the forums, which have already been linked. If your car is OBDII (I admittedly have no idea about the P10 chassis) you could consider getting a step down harness to OBDI if necessary as I think they are easier to tune... Someone may prove me wrong there though. Good luck!"
Nissan,3dzm1f,switchblade55,2,Tue Jul 21 01:14:26 2015 UTC,"I have a sr20ve in my obd1 p10.   Had a buddy do the work, long story short, needed the car running asap.  Running DE injectors, ECU, DE dizzy. Motor pulls strong, cant wait to hook up the.window switch, modified ecu, and VE injectors."
Nissan,3dzm1f,vorin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:02:32 2015 UTC,"With my basic understanding, and knowing that a running car with upgrade potential is acceptable, I'd suggest keeping DE injectors, MAF, and ECU.   When you have the time/money, upgrade those to unlock more potential. Many VEs for sale will come with the ECU."

Nissan,3dukn6,FluroBlack,3,Sun Jul 19 16:56:46 2015 UTC,"My brother has an '85 (I think) and my dad had an '86 that he bought new. Is it a turbo or a nonturbo? That's the most important question. If it's a turbo, it will have the typical problems that a turbo car has. Oil seals can go. Check the turbo for shaft play. The biggest problem with the CA20 (nonturbo) is how painfully slow it is. If it's an '84, that means it has the solid rear axle, if I recall. That's probably actually better here, because the irs caused some problems.   My dad's car had a lot of problems with the turbo later in life, and my brother's car threw a rod recently. The turbo is just sort of an age thing. It just happens. The rod is harder to pin down, because it happened not too long after he bought the car so who knows what kind of life that car led. Basically, as far as I remember from researching them, they don't have more problems than other cars of that era, but keep in mind that you're buying a car that is more than 30 years old. Also, do your own research. I would hate to say it won't have many problems, just for the car to turn out to be a nightmare."
Nissan,3dukn6,EricJ17,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:19:22 2015 UTC,The only gripe I have with the idea of a solid rear axle is trying to lower the car.   Im not going for stance or anything like that but that stock height is less that pretty looking.

One thing I love about the sentras is how they handle, for a little 4banger commuter they have a good ride, but are also not so floaty, you don't get a lot of body roll or nose dive under hard braking.   One thing that is going to feel different to you is the CVT. Its going to feel kinda like its ""slipping"" and you might hear a slight whine. That's pretty normal for a CVT.   We have had the 08 for 5 years now, and have done nothing major besides regular maintenance.   I say check it out, if everything feels normal, take it to a mechanic, if he has the same consensus, pull the trigger.   Good luck."
Nissan,3dqgj4,Ajs1004,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:36:33 2015 UTC,"I have a 2014 Sentra and I love it. Bought it brand new, fully loaded for $18k. For whatever reason, the dealership had it reduced by $6k."
Nissan,3dqgj4,Me4aRZ,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:52:39 2015 UTC,"You mentioned both Versa and Sentra and I can give you a little feedback on both. I bought a 2013 Sentra SR last year and it has not disappointed me at all in the past year and a half. Yes, 130HP isn't much to shake a stick at, you're not looking for a sports car, but it does get up and go nicely around town and accelerates just as well getting onto the highway.  Now my girlfriend has a 2015 Versa Note SR and even at 109(?) HP it definitely does not feel like it has such little power. I've driven her car plenty of times and because of the lack of weight, compared to my Sentra, it feels the same in acceleration again both in town and getting onto the highway. The differences lie only in craftsmanship of the interior. Neither of these cars are a Mercedes but the interior quality on the Sentra is just nice enough to think your driving a higher end Nissan where as the Versa, even the SR feels budget, and for all intents and purposes it still is.  In the end drive both and see which you'd prefer to stick with for the term of your payment, 0 down and 0 interest would be nice but it's hard for a dealership to get a bank to play ball with that if you don't have a running credit history. $12k is a steal of a deal for a Sentra but I'm not sure if you're the kind of person that wants to settle, make sure it has the things you might want that way there's no chance of feeling like you spend 12k on something that you feel is still lacking what you want."

Nissan,3dq945,deerhurst,3,Sat Jul 18 17:06:22 2015 UTC,Usually key on and car not running will throw check engine and other warning indicators because those systems are not working as they should with the key on. I suggest using the accessory position to keep the lights off if you want to do things like listen to the radio. If it isn't diesel leaving it in ON will kill your glow plugs. Use accessory.

Nissan,3dq945,alfa75,-2,Sat Jul 18 12:07:45 2015 UTC,Power steering is fine.. according to the manual that light comes on when the engine is turned off but ignition is turned on and hence the power steering wont be available until the engine is running.

I know you can 'close' the vent, but the mount I have hooks into the flaps on the vent so you can't close it like the picture shows.

Nissan,3do8v0,Tedditor,2,Sat Jul 18 00:11:01 2015 UTC,"Hot or cold air is not going to affect your phone. If you are worried about it overheating the device, just run your vents on ""feet and defrost"" until the cabin is warmed up. That way you won't have so much tempered air blowing on the phone.

They are nice cars and are pretty affordable and come with great features even on the lower end models.  We ultimately decided on another Subaru, but it is all about what you can afford and what appeals to you.  As far as waiting for '16 model years over '15s, thats also up to you.  '16s are just now populating lots and becoming available and are on par as far as price with '15s.  However, you might see certain large-volume dealers discount some '15s to get them off the lot, so there is something to consider.  Personally, I am partial to Subarus, Nissans, and Toyotas, because they hold their value much better than all domestics, and are seemingly more reliable."

No idea if that's true or not since Nissan's site has very little info.  On my '14 Rogue the apps supported are Pandora, iHeartRadio, Facebook, Twitter, Tripadvisor, and Google Search.  Facebook and Twitter are basically useless.  The built in Pandora app also does not let you skip songs (fuckin stupid, right?) unless you thumbs them down.  I can skip songs using the steering wheel next button if I use Pandora on my phone and not on the car, though.  It is fairly buggy and frequently will not connect on its own.  If I open it on my phone it will get stuck ""connecting"".  I then have to close it on my phone and open it again, and it will connect if I do that and then open the apps screen on my car.  Sometimes even after all that the car will give an error saying something went wrong and to disconnect/reconnect the phone.  This is worse for distracted driving than if I were just using the apps on my phone though."
Nissan,3dml0s,tsumeone,2,Fri Jul 17 20:08:03 2015 UTC,"I'm seeing the opposite in my Sentra. The built in app lets me skip songs. When playing via BlueTooth, I can't skip songs. Still, the app doesn't let me change playlists...so I doubt I'll be using it."

It seems Nissan has not done a very good job on their NissanConnect implementation, since it is not consistent across models and generally sparse in features.

The non-nav Muranos have 4 or 5 apps, including Pandora.  The whole thing seems like a mess to me.  I don't use it it, it is slow, requires my iPhone to be plugged in via USB and running the app.  Even then many people have had problems with it."

Getting out of an Altima lease early is always difficult because they are almost never worth the residual value. As far as payments are concerned if you can afford them the Maxima it is amazing and for $100 more a month you wont put yourself in this situation again after 3 years with the mileage.

Anyway you can buy and replace the motor fairly cheap depending on your location. Or if it hasn't gotten bad do a bottom end rebuild which is relatively easy.

Sounds super expensive to me... Considering you can buy used SR20DE's for around 700-900? That mechanic also said he doesn't ever put used engines in a car, so he'd have to rebuild mine.    Most shops are closed now so I'm going to shop around a little bit later on...     Oh, and I'm in the San Fernando Valley SoCal."
Nissan,3dfmlt,bradskibill,3,Thu Jul 16 00:25:36 2015 UTC,Depending on how mechanically inclined you are you can either do the rebuild or the swap there are detailed how tos on www.sr20-forum.com or probably www.g20.net also. I would think being in socal you could find motors all day used for like 400 or so. Shoot for 1500 you could upgrade to the sr20ve or sr20det.

Nissan,3dfmlt,vorin,2,Thu Jul 16 21:17:45 2015 UTC,$1500 seems pretty high for an sr20de. You could get a jdm sr20det and needed parts for the swap for that.

Nissan,3danbt,lians60,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:15:53 2015 UTC,"Overall in terms of Consumer Reports ratings and what I've seen on the 'net, the CVTs are fairly reliable.  It seems that a certain number have in-warranty hiccups, or incurable whines, but have not seen many instances of 'it blew up one week out of warranty'.  I have a 2007 Maxima, now going on 120K miles. Have changed CVT fluid once (am overdue!), but overall cannot complain. My CVT has actually gotten quieter over time, but now the torque converter sometime engages with more of a clunk.  Mine has the famous '1500 RPM groan' (Nissan cured that after 2009) and that has gotten worse.   I sent a sample of my CVT fluid to Blackstone Labs at 80K miles when I swapped fluid and they said there is nothing to worry about in terms of wear metals or fluid condition. Would an extended warranty be a good idea?  Maybe..those are a gamble."
Nissan,3danbt,InfoSecGeek,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:36:02 2015 UTC,"I've heard mixed reviews about CVTs. I bought a used 2008 Rogue with only 38k miles on it last month and already have issues with it. I was driving from Los Angeles to Palm Springs (2-hr drive) and 30 minutes in, the car started to decelerate. Had my foot all the way down on the gas pedal and it wouldn't budge above 55mph.    My car is currently at the mechanic getting a transmission cooler system added (under warranty). It may just be an issue with older models, but I sort of regret the purchase and I wish I would have gone with a CR-V instead."
Nissan,3danbt,jedimustafa,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:31:51 2015 UTC,"I've driven both X-Trail 2015 and CR-V 2014 long enough to give you a quick advice: If you can afford the price difference, go for a Honda. If not, Nissan will do you well, but I doubt the 10 years part (Rogue 2015 is a new design / model and no one can tell yet.)"
Nissan,3danbt,Alexandria1970,2,Wed Jul 15 05:59:29 2015 UTC,"While I own a Nissan, and of course this is a Nissan forum....the CR-V is the better vehicle. I bought a new CR-V in 2002, and that car was, quite literally, perfect. The ONLY part that ever broke over ten years was the door-jamb switch, $5.  No leaks, no rattles, nothing."
Nissan,3danbt,InfoSecGeek,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:12:25 2015 UTC,"Don't be paranoid, Nissan had problems with their CVT's over the years but they improved so much.

Nissan,3danbt,PRO4X,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:07:02 2015 UTC,"It does have the new generation of CVTs, similar to being used in 2013+ Altima and such. They have been improved much from previous generation CVT.  So far I haven't seen much on too much trouble with the CVT(between X-trail, Qashqai and Renault version).   Long as you take care of it and don't beat it up all the time, it should last you some time."
Nissan,3danbt,Exolis87,0,Thu Jul 16 14:22:48 2015 UTC,I got my 2015 Sentra SV about 3 weeks ago. I love it! Upgraded from a 2001 Sentra SE 2.0. Extra smooth ride. Only had 5 miles on it at purchase and just now up to 634 so it's still breaking in.
Nissan,3danbt,pepsiblast08,0,Wed Jul 15 13:44:00 2015 UTC,"You should be okay. Earlier generation Nissan CVTs have had problems, but the latest generations have been a major improvement.  Of course, there have been teething issues on the 2013 and 2014 Altima 2.5 and Rogue with the CVT, but they should be ironed out by the '15 model year.  Pro-tip: If you want a brand new car of a brand new generation of a particular model (example: 2016 Nissan Maxima), wait until the 2018 model where they iron out the kinks from the first two model years of that generation."
Nissan,3db7zq,jedimustafa,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:41:59 2015 UTC,"$225 is a fair price, and it's more likely a dealer will have the correct parts and correct fluid in stock. Not all shops know that a CVT uses special Nissan fluid, so make sure they do not use wrong fluid.  Since you're under warranty, the dealer would be the best bet---if it fails, the dealer could blame the third-party mechanic and deny your claim."
Nissan,3db7zq,InfoSecGeek,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:07:41 2015 UTC,Engine oil cooler o-ring?  How bad is the leak?  Have you noticed any drips on the ground where you park it?  It is probably just weeping a little bit of oil and will do so for years before it becomes a serious leak.
Nissan,3d9nyt,damphoussed,2,Tue Jul 14 16:15:40 2015 UTC,"Start with the basics. Stick with a regular maintenance schedule that should be listed in the manual. Switch to synthetic oil and just keep up with the oil changes. Make sure you keep your receipts for all of them in a file somewhere.   Get a detail annually, or at least a more in-depth hand wash (interior and exterior). Run it through a soft wash every two weeks and make sure it has an undercarriage rinse.  Don't mod it it, drive it as a utility that simply transports you from point A to point B. It will last forever."
Nissan,3d9nyt,NihlusKryik,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:38:31 2015 UTC,Switching to a full synthetic would be a idea. It'll also allow you to change every 5k instead of 3k. I would learn how to do this maintenance yourself to save money. You'll be doing this oil change about every 3 months. If you are driving that much you'll want to rotate your tires every 6 months (every other oil change.)   Rotation should only cost you like 20 bucks.  Full Synthetic oil change will be like 60-80 at a shop/express lube.  Might want to look into a reusable K&N air filter. Will you give a little bit better MPG and you just buy the cleaning kit and clean the air filter yourself.   Washing your car every 2 weeks is fine and along with washing it I would check your tire pressure when you finish. If you're worried about keeping the paint pristine I would learn how to detail a car yourself. Since the paint is brand new I would think you would only need to clay bar the car and then put 2 coats of wax on her. If its a dark color car you can put on a polish before the wax to make her pop. This will help prevent/remove any minor scratches from a car wash as well along with keeping any salt off the actual paint. This will take some time doing it by hand though but the Versa is a pretty small car. I would only wax the car every 2 months but then clay and wax every 6.   Everything else will be in your maintenance schedule.   Congrats on the buy.
Nissan,3d9nyt,BigBuffalo757,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:12:59 2015 UTC,"While I'm not totally against K+N, its a little more delicate than slap it in and clean it yourself.   If you happen to over oil it it can/will ruin your Mass Air Flow sensor and perhaps anything else the oil coats on its way in.  I may be biased, working at a VW dealership and seeing bad MAF's all day because of over oiled or poorly maintained K+N's"
Nissan,3d9nyt,azaizai,2,Tue Jul 14 18:24:02 2015 UTC,Nah I'm sure people do it wrong all the time but I would think the majority of the people suing them have a positive experience but that is a good point for OP to know. Fucking up an MAF is 200-300 bucks easy.  Don't paint the filter red if you do get one OP.
Nissan,3d9nyt,BigBuffalo757,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:29:23 2015 UTC,"I just got a 2015 Sentra SV. Wash it every 2 weeks, wax it every 3 washes (every 6 weeks) is my routine.

Nissan,3d9tjy,InfoSecGeek,2,Tue Jul 14 17:54:16 2015 UTC,"If this is an aftermarket system, that would be very possible to remove.   Probably not super relevant to OP's problem but my brother had 95 Integra with an aftermarket anti-theft system and lost the little fob you need to start the car late one night. Was throwing a fit about how he couldn't get it to start. I just ripped the dang thing out from under the dash and spliced together the two wire ends that the thing was connected to, it fired right up. Hasn't had issues starting since. Look on my bros face was priceless."
Nissan,3d9tjy,IWillHaveVengance,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:28:09 2015 UTC,"Yup, have done the same thing.

Same thing with most aftermarket car stereo installs."
Nissan,3d7tix,Djeheuty,2,Tue Jul 14 04:41:16 2015 UTC,"I own a 2009 Altima 2.5SL and just hit 91,000 miles. The only issues I've had with the car itself have been with the infotainment system (so really not something I can complain about.)  As far as under the hood goes, you won't be able to do too much outside of basic maintenance (changing your fluids, filters, spark plugs and battery) since the CVT is difficult to work on with little experience. If you change the fluids on time and provide basic maintenance the cars will treat you well, although the CVTs can be hit and miss. It's always a gamble when purchasing one. Look into the previous driver history. (If possible find out how old the previous driver was, I'm 19 and can admit to flogging the engine a lot more than necessary)  My only issues with the car are as follows (I've driven it from 63,000->91,000):  At 70,000 I had to replace the battery. Not exactly an issue per se, but thought I would just note it. Surprisingly it was still using the OEM battery.   At about 85,000 I noticed the brake rotors had worn out much faster than they should have in their lifetime. Not another big deal but it can be a comfort issue for the driver.  At around 86,000 the infotainment system/touch screen began to lock up occasionally. This happens about once a month and the only way I've solved it is by turning the car off and then back on.   Edit: Thought I would also note that the OEM paint Nissan uses can be a bit fragile to work with when detailing the paint. It's also prone to rock chips more than other cars I've experienced."

Nissan,3d7tix,BluAnimal,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:44:37 2015 UTC,"I don't know specifically what to look for, but another issue that seems like it would lead to problems is the seal between the door and window. My friend has one of these, likes the car all around, but when we have a hard rain his door collects tons of water inside. He has to slam it a few times after the rain to get it out. Water literally just pours out of the door. Just an FYI.   Other than that I think these cars look great and have heard good things. Not much of a help on your specific questions tho."
Nissan,3d7tix,modern_markings,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:58:59 2015 UTC,"That's good to know. I actually had that problem on a prior car (2002 Optima) and there was even a recall for it. All they did was drill a drain hole and seal around the hole properly so it didn't rust out.  I know not all cars have these problems and it's just a small percentage that is, but it's still something I worry about since I wont exactly have spare money to fix something that's going to cost like $1K, but I want a newer car so that I hopefully wont run into that problem."
Nissan,3d7tix,bdarknessb,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:10:30 2015 UTC,"As u/modern_markings mentioned, I had the same issue where water got in the door after heavy rain, and you could hear it wooshing around while driving.. The fix was simple, there are drain holes on the bottom behind the rubber which were clogged, cleaning those drained all the water.. And I haven't had any issue since.  I have the 2010 Altima (4.5 gen), and am very happy with it. Average fuel economy has been great so far ~25mpg combined.  I paid around $12,000 including all taxes and fees. It had 31k miles when I got it about 6 months ago.  I recommend going with lower mileage.. Be sure to check the carfax report and look for the obvious signs of an accident. When test driving turn on the ac or windshield defroster to put the car under a little bit of stress to see how it handles it. Go over some bumpy roads to see how smooth or rough the suspension is. Also check the braking power and tire wear. The battery should also have a sticker on it with the month and year it was produced. Knowing these things will help you negotiate a better price."

Nissan,3d2puh,soapsuds43,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:51:25 2015 UTC,"Bought a 03 with 43k/mi in 2010 for $11000 cash. But price may reflect your area.  CC, LB, 4WD, AT, SVE trim. Push bar, bed cover, tint job, new tires, Full Sony system.   I'm somewhere around 116k/mi now and have never ran premium fuel, but a handful of times. They are engine's that require you follow service intervals or they get finicky. The upper bearing in the distributor likes to grenade a bit after 100k/mi. Timing belt service is best done before 100k, mine was loose when i changed it at 96k - and was causing poor idle stability.   Fuel economy is poor/fair, expect 14-16/18-20 city/hey. Ride quality is good. The headlights have needed restoration 3 times now, and this year have began to yellow out so they will be replaced outright. Interior room is good up front, and reduces to a bad joke when you have anyone over the size of a child in the back seat.  4wd is beast in mud or snow, swapped over to the SC wheels and 275/75/17 Nitto terra grapplers in spring 2013 (90k/mi ish)which will need replacement by winter, expect decent AT tires to be 600-700 at least.   It may feel quick initially, but that wears off and you realize how much of a fat pig it is. Swapped on Doug Thorley long tubes + 2.5"" exhaust system, 15°, e-fans, airbox mod + k&n, and '84-86 300zx cams - it's got great pull down low but doesn't do much above highway merging speed. Haven't fiddled with the pulley yet, but would like to... This will likely req you to run premium if you don't want to ping. Speaking of which you will want to relocate the knock sensor out of the galley before it shits the bed (timing belt service is a excellent time for this).  The supercharger doesn't add much to the bay, and honestly has been easier to work on than the goofy lay over intake manifold of the non-sc models.  Given the opportunity to go back buy it again, I would not buy it again but would probably choose ether a pre2000 hardbody 4cyl 4wd 2dr long bed 5sp or similar Toyota pick up..

Nissan,3d15qb,nikki109,2,Sun Jul 12 17:40:57 2015 UTC,"You can't really judge a tire by the brand. Every brand makes good tires and shitty tires. You have to look at the review for the specific tires themselves and the category as an extreme performance summer tire will perform differently from an all-weather tire. Since you are in Texas I recommend getting summer tires instead of all seasons, they will be better in everything except for performance in the cold. Shop for a decent set of summers with a good treadwear rating and I assure you you won't go back to all-seasons."

Nissan,3ckwds,DiegoLego,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:07:35 2015 UTC,What's the biggest difference between the Max and Altima to you?  I've been trying to talk myself into a bigger car but am afraid the Maxima is too big.
Nissan,3ckwds,Exolis87,2,Wed Jul 8 18:50:56 2015 UTC,"Oh God, dude...  I LOVED my Maxima. The size. The handling. The acceleration.   It's a little more spacious on the inside, in my opinion. It picks up way faster (obviously attribute that to the 3.5L V6). The handling is incredible compared to an Altima - you have to drive one to know what I'm talking about. But hitting curves on the road is much smoother in a Maxima.  And you know what? The car just FEELS sturdier to me. I don't know how to describe it, but it just seems more solid. While the Altima IS still nice and pretty, it feels more ""hollow and plastic"" to me...whatever that means.  Other than the above mentioned, theyre both still only full-sized family sedans. Sure, the Maxima is touted about as a 4DSC, but at the end of the day, the fucker still has latches for your 2 year old's car seat and will seat 5. But it lets us dads feel cool and classy taking family from point A to point B, for sure.  EDIT: Forgot to address your ""too big"" issue. The body is not that much bigger than an Altima - especially the 8th gen model (2016 - ?) - it's more smooth and sleek. The 7th gen was a little more ""boxy"" so it seemed a little bigger, but still not by much."
Nissan,3ckwds,Exolis87,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:57:22 2015 UTC,"If you liked that about the Maxima, the new one is much much better. It accelerates pretty damn quick, especially with Sport mode on. I don't own one, but have been hearing it gets really good gas mileage too.   Just go to your local dealer and test drive one, take it on the highway and Floor it in Sport mode. It's basically better then the previous Maxima in everyway."
Nissan,3ckwds,DiegoLego,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:54:24 2015 UTC,"So the last gen had Ds Mode as well, but many people argued that it really wasn't making your Max pick up any faster...and many also argued that while the paddleshifters were cool, they served no real purpose with the CVT doing the shift-job much smoother and more efficiently, as well.  I'd LOVE to test drive one but I can admit - I am rather impulsive and I have good credit - so I'd probably leave with one... we don't wanna make that mistake. Might make the fiancee a little mad, haha.  But really, do you have any insight regarding what I mentioned about last gen's ""sport mode"" and paddleshifters vs this gen?"
Nissan,3ckwds,InfoSecGeek,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:59:00 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. So the sport mode has it's own switch (Standard and Sport modes). Unlike some other Nissan's, the Sport mode makes a drastic change in how the car responds. My 1st gen Rogue had ""Sport"" mode that basically kept the Idle higher by few RPMs and probably changed the rate the CVT would change gear ratio by a small amount, really didn't do much.   With sport mode on new Maxima, Sport mode is actually a Sport mode. It's kinda hard to explain it, but you can tell a huge difference from 0-60 between Standard and Sport. It also will use shift points, which I'm not sure if it's just for sound or if it's to change the ratio differently so it keeps the RPM in it's optimal power range.   Could just bring your license with you, keep the rest of your wallet at home. :) (I promise I'm not a sales person and I get nothing if you do decide to get one)."

Honestly if the Xterra 188k miles I wouldn't worry about SMOG, you should be able to visually see if the radiator failed by this point. Might be a good time to replace it anyways if its the original.

While you could get lucky and if the vehicle has been gently driven and well maintained, you could get a year or two out of it, a vehicle with close to 200K and you being an owner with limited car knowledge--it sounds like a bad idea to me.   Also, not knowing your situation--if you're driving five miles on secondary roads to get to work, then a breakdown would not be the end of the world, while if your daily commute involves the Dalton Highway in Alaska, a breakdown could have grizzly consequences."

There are places on eBay that sell painted-to-match bumper covers for around $300. By the time you add shipping and any other little clips/brackets, plus your time, you're not going to save more than maybe $100. $600 is dirt cheap, make sure it's a genuine Nissan part, not a knockoff.

I switched to Yokohama Avid Ascender, and those tires are fantastic--virtually silent, grippy, great in the rain, good handling, and so far wearing well. Those were in the top four of Consumer Reports most recent tire test, and were quietest of top four.    TLDR; Yokohama Avid Ascender   A good all around tire is the Goodyear Eagle RS-A.

Nissan,3bwm4u,jocker12,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:23:31 2015 UTC,"That's a shame ): I was wondering about a ""Pulsar GTi-R"", you know, 4wd, 2.0L turbo and some cool looks, the normal Pulsar is kinda boring and doesn't have any kind of performance option. There might not be the ""fanbase"" that the likes of the Ford hatches (ST and RS models, esp Fiesta and Ford), Japanese super-saloons (Evo and WRX) and the Honda Type Rs, so perhaps one might not sell. A lot of tales of cars entering an already dealt with segment are ones of differentiation and innovation....  To be honest, I'm not sure what hot Nissans I'd be interested in. I'll try and think, btw, I'm in the UK, European land! Sorry Americans. Altima NISMO maybe? The American market is very different.   Supermini - I don't think a the kind of audience who'd buy a 'hot' version would buy a Micra ""Performance"" B or C segment hatches are pretty saturated so maybe it's wise to stay out of there. Ford, VW Group, Honda and so on have it sorted, and there's more I'm sure that have strong followings and sales. Crossovers are a strong segment (at least in Europe), so it's probably not a bad idea to make a 'hot' version of theirs. A hot SUV, Pickup (that Toyota pickup or anything American) or Minivan (Renault Espace F1!) would be hilarious but might not work too well, but hey, tell the Aussies and their Utes... Sportscars and Coupes don't really sell too well anymore (eg, Silvia, Tiburon, Integra, Celica, ect) unless they're sorta big and 'GT'y and the 350 and 370Z have been around for long enough that the product works. Then again Toyota/Subaru GT-86 and Mazda MX-5 are a thing so... who knows Leaf - !!! THE LEAF! It's the answer and Nismo has already visited the Leaf for some race version of it... Think about it, it could possibly make the GT-R R35 and Tesla Model S look slow! Probably. I think there maybe some packaging and range issues. But it's be hilarious -  ""Hey, what do you drive?""  'A Leaf...'  '...NISMO.'   In conclusion, my opinion is they probably made the right decision.  edit: Silvia S16 please... );"
Nissan,3bwm4u,laheugan,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:26:17 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Audi has S-Line versions of all their vehicles, Mercedes has AMG versions of all their vehicles, and BMW has M versions of all their vehicles, and I don't think their brands are devalued. It's a good way to make more money for Nissan and convince buyers to get more expensive Nismo models down the road."
Nissan,3bwm4u,RouseHouse1013,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:58:32 2015 UTC,"Having a performance trim for the people looking for that niche would be amazing. The only thing that would ""devalue"" the brand would be putting out cars that don't live up the NISMO moniker. If they could properly produce and put out NISMO trims of all cars then go for it. I would love to burn around in a little turbo-ed Sentra or Altima while I save up for Z."

Nissan,3bvwpr,InfoSecGeek,2,Fri Jul 3 21:20:17 2015 UTC,"What you have is a high-performance (HP) Summer tire with a very soft compound and exceptional grip. Your experience is more to do with the tire choice vs brand  Yokohama Avid Ascender is a quiet grippy tire that handles well. Have those on Toyota Highlander.    Goodyear Eagle RS-A is a good all-around tire, and Goodyear Comfort-Treads or Triple-Treds are extra quiet and very smooth. Those are touring tires which will have a bit less grip than a summer HP tire, but will last longer.  Goodyear Eagle RS-A is standard issue on just about every police car and police SUV since they wear well, have great grip, and are cheaper than other similar tires.  Consumer reports top four all-season tires are: 1) Goodyear TripleTred 2) Pirelli P4 3) Michelin Energy Saver 4) Yokohama Avid.  Of the 19 tires they tested, only Avid got ""Excellent"" rating for noise."

Key considerations are safety for my wife and kids (not high performance) e.g grip, braking, traction in damp, light rain of the NW, etc. Of the options you've listed, is there a tire that you would choose over the others?"
Nissan,3bvgxr,zeddellamero,2,Thu Jul 2 14:07:10 2015 UTC,"I did when I bought my 350Z in 2003. The lack of a hardtop on the S2000, complete lack of luggage space, and lack of torque kept me from committing on the S2000. At the time this was a big deal because I was a Honda fanboi and all I had owned up til buying my 350Z were an Acura Legend, a Honda Accord, and an Integra GSR.  The biggest thing was compared to the Z, the S2000 really had to be ragged out to get any power out of it. I preferred the torque of the Z for getting around town and making my way through traffic. Also, I really do not like soft-tops.  I kept my 350Z for 5 years until an unfortunate winter weather accident. I have a 370Z now and love it."

Nissan,3brydl,config__t,3,Thu Jul 2 03:28:36 2015 UTC,I have owned many R32 GTRs but only one GTi-R. The GTi-R lacks torque compared to the GTR in my opinion. Stock for stock the boost isn't as pronounced as it is on a stock GTR. The GTi-R feels a lot nimbler and easier to mess around with in shitty weather. I felt a little more confident driving the GTi-R in winter than I did the GTR.

Nissan,3bqaeo,Mattrix2,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:40:42 2015 UTC,"In all honesty - I'd also be sure and cross-shop the Altima.  You may be quite surprised at how much more interior room the Altima has over the Maxima.  Those rear-facing car seats for infants take up a LOT OF ROOM.  You'll want all the back-seat space that you can handle.  I know that our '06 Altima can handle three car seats across the back if necessary.    The Altima should also be less money for the same mileage/condition car.    Same motor in the Maxima as in the V-6 Altimas - but de-tuned a bit to make less HP.  That vintage is still in the ""Premium Fuel recommended"" stage of the VQ - however, it will run fine on 87 and 89 octane.   Neither the VQ 6-cyl nor the 4-cyl of the Altima will set the world on fire with fuel mileage.  I average around 27-28 mpg combined out of my V-6 with 132k miles.  A co-worker has an '05 4-cyl Altima and doesn't see all that much better MPG.    Not to talk you out of a Nissan product - but what's your current budget?"
Nissan,3bqaeo,Tactically_Fat,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:20:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  My budget is around 5000.  I was looking at Nissan Versa's, Honda Fits, and Honda Civics.  Saw a Maxima come up for sale that was $5000.00 and thought I'd consider it.  As of the moment I'm learning towards a Nissan Versa.  I would like a Honda Fit but they seem harder to find under $5000.00"
Nissan,3bqaeo,IWillHaveVengance,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:54:03 2015 UTC,Have you drove a versa? They are pretty gutless fyi. Sounds like they are reliable other than just Nissan's CVT (don't know much about the nissan CVT but sounds like all are hit or miss)
Nissan,3bqaeo,Tactically_Fat,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:36:07 2015 UTC,"No I haven't driven a versa.  But I'm not expecting it to be like my mr2 or my 350 hp 240sx haha.  My wife had a Juke that we just traded for a new Rogue as well which all have CVT's.  So I'm use to the CVT now.  I read online a lot of people hate them but I don't mind them.  I'm just leaning towards to Versa now, and I'll just save for a fun project car."
Nissan,3bqaeo,Karlin0,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:33:26 2015 UTC,"Is that $5k plus the value of your smaller car?  For $5k, I personally would be looking at a private seller selling an old-lady driven old Buick.  Sporty - no.  But plenty roomy, safe, relatively economical, and PLENTY of room for all the stuff that needs toted around with kids.  If you're at all tall - you'll quickly learn that rear-facing child seats in the rear don't allow the front seats to slide back nearly as far as needed to be half-way comfortable IF you're tall.  But - both my wife and I are over 6' tall.  Even some larger vehicles, like a Subaru Forester, are too small for us + those kid seats. (This was a 2010 model that we ""test fit"" our kid seat into - wouldn't work)."

They are pretty heavy on gas and a little boaty from factory. If you don't mind a bit of modification, you can throw in some stiffer springs and it'll drive like a dream. I've put mine on adjusties and it's a good drive.   The 4wd models run the same ATTESA 4wd system as the GTR and probably have a more sturdy ride from the factory anyway.  I love the car and have learnt a lot from modding it as my first project, but for a daily driver it is pretty expensive to run around in.  My car is running quite rich atm, but at a rough estimate it's 15-20NZD per 100k, which works out to around 23-31mpg according to google if I did it right. Though yours would be a 25det neo, which is a more efficient model engine.  Besides all of this, they are very friendly towards a bit of modification. Mine's just been cranked up to 10psi and once you put your foot down, the weight of it is gone.

Nissan,3bf25f,epyon22,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:39:07 2015 UTC,For the head unit connection you'll have to open up the dash and pull the radio out and the wires will go into the back of that. You'll need to find a pin out for that connector to know which wire to check. The amplifier could be any where maybe behind the dash or in the trunk somewhere. I know on my sentra it is located in the trunk. You'll also need a pin out for that to know what specific wire to check. If you are savvy with a multi meter figuring out which is the power should be pretty easy.
Nissan,3bf25f,IWillHaveVengance,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:16:12 2015 UTC,Well it is a 95.. Might be time to just replace it. You can get a decent head unit and all the install parts for less than ~$100 or you could always buy the same one from ebay / a junk yard. I would also check the amp too as other have suggested.

Nissan,3bagel,iproginger,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:11:42 2015 UTC,True though many hybrids will use electric motors forbade short distance then switch over. Especially on acceleration in town where you burn the most fuel.
Nissan,3bagel,deerhurst,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:14:07 2015 UTC,"Exactly, it'll use both depending on speed and such. The miniscule range is if you're driving on 100% electric power. If you use the electric when starting off and getting up to speed, and use the gas engine to maintain speed, with regen braking you shouldn't run out of juice."
Nissan,3bagel,iproginger,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:31:13 2015 UTC,Kind of the idea of the volt. It only moves its self with an electric motor and uses the gas one to charge the batteries.
Nissan,3bagel,deerhurst,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:46:12 2015 UTC,"It's a bit different. With the method I described, you use the electricity to accelerate, then use the engine to maintain speed like in a normal car.

Nissan,3bagel,TheRealFilthyRich,2,Sat Jun 27 20:05:25 2015 UTC,"I put a 91 cummins 4bt diesel in a 2004 4wd Tahoe.  I get almost 30 mpg in a 7000lb vehicle and my total cost for the build will be about 7g (Tahoe had a blown head gasket).  I will run biodiesel and have 0 emissions.  Battery's are not an efficient way to store energy and are a joke.  More emmissions are created in making and disposing of batteries then what they save in fuel.  Have fun with your ""Hybrid"" but you were duped into thinking you are saving the environment."
Nissan,3bagel,fooljoe,3,Sat Jun 27 14:55:04 2015 UTC,"Your biodiesel project certainly sounds nice, but the rest of what you said is unsubstantiated.   I will run biodiesel and have 0 emissions   Biodiesel's certainly better than ""regular"" diesel or gasoline, but to call it ""0 emissions"" is inaccurate - while all the CO2 released will have of course come from recent sunlight as opposed to fossilized sunlight, farming and processing plants into fuel is a very energy-intensive process that involves all sorts of external (most likely fossil fuel) energy input.   Battery's are not an efficient way to store energy   Batteries are one of the most efficient ways to store energy. The energy you get out will typically be at least 80% of what you put in. If the input is solar power and you have 20% efficient photovoltaic panels, then that means an electric vehicle will effectively convert 16% of the total insolation into motion. For comparison, storing solar power in biodiesel is terribly inefficient, with only a tiny fraction of a percent of insolation used for motion.  And if you're talking about a non-plug-in hybrid, then all of the energy used to charge its battery comes from the vehicle's momentum - energy that could never be stored in a biodiesel or conventional car, so there's no comparison there whatsoever in terms of efficiency. Did you mean to use some term other than ""efficient"", perhaps ""cost effective""? An argument could be made there...   More emmissions are created in making and disposing of batteries then what they save in fuel.   This is apparently a widely-held belief, but rigorous studies on the matter show it to be completely false: What small added energy cost there is for EVs and hybrids due to battery production and disposal is quickly erased by their fuel consumption savings."
Nissan,3bagel,TheRealFilthyRich,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:37:47 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately there are very few studies that you can actually trust and that is the problem with the internet.  You are led to believe one thing or another by ""rigorous studies""  Somehow everyone is to believe that energy efficient bulbs are a good thing but they don't last any longer than incandescents and are filled with mercury.  Since they don't give off heat and lights are mostly on in the winter months, alternative methods of heat offset their efficiency.   I'm not sure what you are talking about storing sunlight in bio-diesel.  I know that what I'm running is WVO or ""waste vegetable oil"".  It already served its purpose but can now be repurposed to run equipment.  The very equipment needed to harvest and make biodiesel, can run on biodiesel.  There will never be Transport trucks tractors or planes that run on battery as it is not efficient enough.  Electric cars were around before the internal combustion engine, but faded away quickly for a reason.  I think the real answer is hydrogen but there is not enough profit in it for our governments through taxes for it to ever take off.  The people who are in power to actually save our environment won't do so thanks to the all mighty dollar."
Nissan,3bagel,fooljoe,2,Wed Jul 1 02:28:47 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately there are very few studies that you can actually trust and that is the problem with the internet   You should never have blind trust in any study, seen on the internet or otherwise. Studies are meant to be read and critically analyzed; their assumptions checked against reality and their methodology tested. Do you take issue with any of the assumptions or methodologies employed in the UCLA study?   I'm not sure what you are talking about storing sunlight in bio-diesel   Biodiesel comes from plants; plants grow from sunlight: Biodiesel energy (like nearly all energy on Earth) is stored sunlight.   I know that what I'm running is WVO   Biodiesel from WVO is certainly a great use for something that might be otherwise discarded, but it's obviously not a scalable alternative fuel source. If you're going to advocate for wider usage of biodiesel over other options, you'll have to account for increased land devoted to vegetable oil production; WVO won't cut it.   There will never be Transport trucks tractors or planes that run on battery as it is not efficient enough.   As I mentioned before, you're misusing the term ""efficient."" Efficiency means the portion of energy or work you get out of a process divided by what you put in. The reason batteries won't be used to power airplanes (actually they are, but not the sort of airplane that's going to take hundreds of people halfway around the world in a few hours) is energy density: It takes a lot more weight and volume to store the same amount of energy in a battery relative to what can be stored in liquid fuels.  This is certainly a fair criticism of batteries, and liquid fuels will likely be needed for commercial aviation for the foreseeable future. But for just about everything else liquid fuels are not needed and are a terribly inefficient option: personal automotive transportation and short-range trucking can be accomplished with battery electric vehicles; long-range trucking can be replaced with electric rail; shipping can be powered with on-board wind/solar/nuclear.    I think the real answer is hydrogen but there is not enough profit in it for our governments through taxes for it to ever take off   The problem with hydrogen is again efficiency. If hydrogen is to be a ""clean"" fuel, it will be produced from electricity. But if you start with the same amount of electricity, the extra steps required to produce hydrogen leave you with only enough energy to drive about 1/4 as far as you could if you just took that starting electricity and charged EVs with it instead. The only reason you keep hearing about hydrogen is that there is a ton of money in it for established players like oil companies."

Your light bulb anecdote is interesting, though, as it hints at the danger of just focusing on one metric rather than the overall picture. Still, the vast improvement in efficiency going from incandescents to CFLs shouldn't be scoffed at, lack of durability notwithstanding. And what's a little mercury between friends? Anyway, today's LEDs seem to fix those problems and have even better efficiency - sometimes there are a few hiccups on the way to progress (incidentally that's how I might describe hybrids on the path to EVs.)"

Nissan,3bchs0,stromm,2,Sun Jun 28 15:30:03 2015 UTC,"You mean you can't get the wheels off?  Make sure safety first   Put wheel chocks behind the tires not being lifted (rear in this case). Make sure you slide them tight to the tires.   Break loose but do not remove the lugnuts.   Jack up the corner of the car you are working on and put a jack stand in the proper place as defined by the manual. Lower the jack lift just enough to settle the weight on the stand. Proper height needs only be so the tire is an inch or so above the floor/ground.   Wiggle the car to make sure it is stable and secure on the stand. Sometimes they can slip.   Now fully remove the lugnuts. Then with a mallet, give the TIRE a good wack. Not the wheel (rim). That should pop the wheel loose of the hub.    Worst case, put the lugs back on, almost tight but not all the way. Pretty much just before they snug in. You do NOT want them loose.   Lower the car, remove the lift and chocks. Then get in, put the car in gear and let it roll just a few inch and hit the brakes hard. That almost always pops through the corrosion binding the wheel to the hub."

Before you put the wheel back on, get soemthing to sand down the surface rust on the hub (the part in the center of the disk where the lugs come out).  Clean it off and then apply a VERY thin layer of high temp grease all over the flat outer surface that will touch the inside of the wheel itself.  You want just enough to make it look different, not enough that wiping your finger on it will bring anything away.  That should prevent future sticking.  Oh, and get your tires rotated every 5-6,000 miles too.  Methinks you haven't done that... (Since the wheel is stuck...)"

I had no problems with Rivsu. Just registered the car today at the DMV and I had more problems with them than with Rivsu.

Nissan,3atozy,KrootLoops,3,Tue Jun 23 14:43:27 2015 UTC,Nothing bad meant. Just wondering. Did you get it cheap or had a buddy that did a swap in a 350z to Ls or something. Or just had planned by from beginning. I have a g35 and know it take lots of fund to build motor to keep it semi reliable around 400hp. Did you find like a donor car with wiring and everything? I just want to know more about the swap
Nissan,3atozy,KrootLoops,3,Tue Jun 23 14:46:46 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I assumed it more harshly than it was meant.   I have a g35 as well. I love the car. I guess I should qualify the motor choice by saying the motor I pulled out I'd built over the last 10 years or so. It was an sr20det, big top mount turbo, internals, all that jazz, about 420 to the wheels on 15 or so psi.   Probably makes it sound a little more ridiculous that I went with this motor I guess. Yeah I got a good deal on it. I've ended up making the mounts and exhaust stuff myself. A friend of mine did the harness so it's super simple. Right now it just has basic stuff. The tune and all of the breathing mods (minus the plenum spacer in this picture).   So, really, as for why I went with this, it comes down to what what use the car for. It's mostly just a weekend fun car. Something I want to take to the mountains and be able to carve with. Also the occasional trip to Road Allanta or Carolina Motorsports Park for track time. I wanted something with as much low torque as I needed and some super snappy acceleration and throttle response. This definitely fits the bill.    Also, you,can just barely see another 240 off to the side in one of those pictures...got that to start messing with next. Either another SR or a 1J. With that I'll attempt to do the same in terms of throttle response and acceleration, just using turbos this time."

Just engage the break when you stop and give it a little gas before you release the brake. It won't damage the parking brake or normal brake. Automatic transmissions use a torque converter instead of a friction plate, it's not going to put major stress on the brakes."

Nissan,3at1qh,cheski22,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:55:45 2015 UTC,Not sure how this has anything to do with nissan but honestly this is something you should have practiced when you got learners permit way back when. Sure automatics will rollback a little bit but nowhere near as much as a stick. Just take your foot off the break and put a little pressure on the gas. You should be able to do enough where you stay still or slightly inch forward and give it more gas when you are ready to enter the road / traffic.

The Frontier should have the attitude of screw work, lets play. While the Titan is the work truck. I also would like to see a price drop for each so I could afford one. :)  I've had 2 WD21 Pathfinders and I currently have a WD22 Xterra. These are/were a lot of fun. Nissan's tagline for my Xterra was, ""Everything you need, nothing you don't."" I feel Nissan should go back to that philosophy."
Nissan,3ao1eu,Jonr1138,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:39:35 2015 UTC,I agree. I have a hardbody and every late 80s hardbody commercial is about bouncing and jumping through the back roads.

I bought it really cheap at 190 000km. Been working on it non stop for weeks. If you ever run into trouble with yours just pm me ;)  This model is known for blown connecting rod bearing, so listen for metallic clicking in the engine. Also watch for white smoke since this is a sign of a blown head gasket (burnt coolant).  English isnt my first language so sorry for spelling/grammar. Cheers!"
Nissan,3anlkc,nickemeh,4,Mon Jun 22 05:17:43 2015 UTC,"I have one as a track car, what do you want to know?   At those K's I'd want to confirm if it's had the headgasket replaced as it'll likely need it soon if not.   How many K's has the T28 done as that's not stock. Neither are the injectors so I'd want to know if it's been tuned and if so to what power level - then next question would be what clutch is in it.   At those K's most suspension bushes will be quite old, see what's been replaced and what hasn't.  The butterfly system on the intake is also prone to failure (vacuum controlled) so check vac lines are healthy.  A boost leak test would be a good idea, you can make a tester from parts for a few dollars - I can show you mine.   Being a sports car they are often crashed, look for signs of quarter panels being removed (paint disturbed around bolt holes along the top of the guard.   They rust along the sills and in the front and back of quarter panels as the plastic liners are often damaged.   The chassis rails are often damaged from being jacked up repeatedly, look for that as too much damage can mean the car is actually a write off.   The rest applies to any car, service history, fluid health, water damage on the boot floor, oil leaks etc etc (the half moons and rockers are notorious for leaking).  What else do you want to know?   Here's mine:  http://imgur.com/a/4GRLf"
Nissan,3anlkc,_ActionDan_,2,Mon Jun 22 01:20:59 2015 UTC,Wow! That's a lot of info! Thanks! Nice car too.  Honestly I don't know anything else about the car than what I listed. Apparently the whole cylinder head is blown so I'd have to replace that.  I think you really told me everything. I wanted to know what to check for if anything special. I will definitely ask about the K's on the turbo and if the injectors are tuned and what not.   I didn't expect an answer this fast. Seriously thank you! I'll read up a bit more about the car in general etc. I hope I can make a deal with the seller!
Nissan,3anlkc,_ActionDan_,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:53:54 2015 UTC,"What's blown? Getting a new/second hand head might not be easy in the US. They are dirt cheap here but I was under the impression they were not common over there.   If only the gasket is blown you need to know where it blew as oil and coolant may have mixed, which will require both the oil and coolant systems to be flushed.   You also need ot know why it blew, poor service history? Bad tune? Detonation?   When the head is off you should also have it skimmed and put new vale seats and guides in while you have the chance - also a good chance to do a basic cam upgrae (put an exhaust cam on the intake side as they are dirt cheap and you will gain a few degrees duration and a little more lift) and some adjustable gears - can share what changes mine required for max result but they vary based on turbo.   I did not mean the injectors tuned, I mean the ECU.   It should have had an EPROM soldered in or have some form of after market engine management.   CAs are most commonly tuned using Flashed EPROMS, a PowerFC or a Nistune.   Or using piggyback computers that alter input signals (what I have, an SAFC II and an SITC).   These are not the types of cars you want daily if you are not mechanically minded.   I would encourage you to find out more about the car and take someone with knowledge with you to inspect it properly - or a pay a workshop to inspect it.   Gearbox synchros will also be getting tired at those K's, 2nd and 3rd in particular. That model also has shit brakes, but they take brakes from later models, I can give you more info on that."
Nissan,3anlkc,imcompetent,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:59:15 2015 UTC,"Rust. I said this on a different thread a while ago. These cars are notorious for being prone to rusting.  Make sure you thoroughly check under the car to be certain that if it does have any rotten bits, that it won't cost you an arm and a leg to fix it.  The boot lid is also another place to check for rust. The factory spoilers on these cars were terrible and water would easily leak under them, rusting the boot lid creating a hole allowing more water to go in and rot the lid from the inside.  I'll upload a few pictures in a little while so you can see what I had to get fixed on mine because I didn't take a jack with me to check the car properly."
Nissan,3anlkc,imcompetent,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:50:15 2015 UTC,"Alright, will specifically check those places then! This car doesn't have a spoiler though, maybe it's been taken away? Had rust before possibly? Did all the cars come with a factory spoiler?   Pictures are very appreciated! Thanks a ton!!!"
Nissan,3anlkc,imcompetent,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:58:07 2015 UTC,"Here you go: http://m.imgur.com/a/fMOZY  If the guy has taken off the spoiler it was probably because it was either already rotted or he did it to stop it from rotting. But as far as I know yes, they all came with spoilers.  The 2 pictures after that monstrocity of a rotten strut, those are pictures of the radiator support which was completely rotted in the middle. That was an expensive job!  All in all I've spent a over £1500 just getting rid of rust and replacing rotten bits here and there, so be careful!"

Nissan,3af6ky,Sixkitties,2,Fri Jun 19 17:08:21 2015 UTC,You can expect the dealership to find and fix the seal under warranty. Any damage caused will likely be replaced as well under warranty. They should also be able to clean the carpet well enough or replace it if it's damaged by mold.  Was there any reason why they did just the door align and not inspect all the seals? I would have expected them to take the trim out and soak it with water to check to make sure the vehicle is properly sealed.   Just make sure they inspect everything thoroughly and be able to tell you exactly where it was leaking from.   Good luck with the repair. Sorry to hear that happened.
Nissan,3af6ky,Exolis87,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:56:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why they didn't inspect the seal, if I remember correctly they said something along the lines of, ""Oh, we've heard of this happening, it's just the door."" So they might have thought it was a simple fix.  But seriously, thank you for replying. Knowing that it should be covered by the warranty is a load off of my mind. d:"
Nissan,3af6ky,BrosephDudeson,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:28:55 2015 UTC,"With that amount of water there should be very obvious signs of water leakage if it's coming through the door or window. It would be pouring in. It may be that water is somehow making it into the fresh air vent in the wiper cowl and dumping into the car via the HVAC box. I've seen a few similar situations.  Either way, Nissan will take care of you. If your dealer doesn't handle it to your expectations call Nissan corporate. In most states 3 consecutive failed repairs falls under the lemon law, and they will probably buy it back from you to avoid litigation."

Nissan,3a7jba,pepsiblast08,5,Wed Jun 17 21:04:28 2015 UTC,"No you can't really get the 'SV' package after the fact. At least not in a cost effective way. Sure wheels, heated mirros, heated seats, nav system, and even a spoiler are not that hard to add after the fact but the moon roof? Thats not something that can be easily added.   I would either get them upfront or just go with out them because it will be a lot more to get them after the fact. A lot of the items you will be missing out on though can be done via aftermarket options later on for cheaper. If you are financing part of the car and putting that much down anyways would it really be that much more to get the options you want? Maybe get a 2014 sv model with low miles. Its the same car revision."
Nissan,3a7iu8,jocker12,3,Wed Jun 17 21:01:30 2015 UTC,"Whatever they do it needs to be dramatic. I test drove the Z recently hoping to get the coolest car I can afford with my company discount. There were just so many things that did't work for it. It felt heavier than a Mustang (that I also just test drove) even though it has two less seats and is a few hundred pounds lighter. The clutch was atrocious. The rev-matching was super awkward when accelerating heavily. The engine was fast, but for the same price as a 2015 Mustang GT (when similarly equipped), it felt sluggish at most speeds.  TL;DR: The Z needs an overhaul so I can get one on company lease ASAP."
Nissan,3a7iu8,bchiz10,2,Thu Jun 18 02:05:06 2015 UTC,I love Nissans and Z's but I agree wholeheartedly. The Z34 is so damned heavy and the clutch which is pretty similar to the Z33's engages so high up.

Nissan,3a35md,Overloaded1,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:26:07 2015 UTC,"Sounds a lot like a mechanical problem inside the HVAC unit. If it's highway speeds only, it could possibly have something to do with the incoming air into the HVAC overpowering a door or flap. The Dealership needs to be made aware that the issue is persisting after service. Take a tech on a ride and show them. You might actually look into Lemon laws in your state. Those laws state that if you take a new vehicle back (x) amount of times for the same problem, you can get compensated with a full refund, or a replacement."

Nissan,3a35md,InfoSecGeek,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:30:28 2015 UTC,"If your AC water drain is blocked it could fill up with water, then the evap core could freeze up, which would block all airflow.   If water drain is blocked it would cause mildew smell and carpet on pass side may be wet.   Is the car parked where leaves, particularly willow leaves fall on it? Those go into the AC system and block the drain.  On most cars it's easy to inspect/replace the cabin air filter, while unlikely to be the problem, that might be something to take a peek at."

Nissan,39xdbk,eps89,3,Mon Jun 15 16:00:06 2015 UTC,Is the air filter you got a wet or dry type? Some oiled filters can have too much oil on them of which oil ends up on your MAF sensor which screws everything up.

I used a K&N aftermarket filter in my Maxima and have had no issues at all, so maybe you should try that out.(It's cleanable and reusable.) Just curious, why did you change the air filter anyway though? The service manual doesn't recommend that until 30k/3 years. No way you already hit 30k already in that new of a car?  edit: http://www.knfilters.com/search/product.aspx?prod=33-2478"
Nissan,39xdbk,yimmy149,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:57:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I totally should've checked that. I just decided to take it upon myself to change it since the place who wanted to do my oil change wanted to charge me $71 JUST for an oil change.  So, do you think the air filter I got is what's causing the issue?  EDIT: Do you suggest any other filters to check out that aren't that pricey? I know K&N is good, but if there is a more affordable option, I'll totally hop on."
Nissan,39xdbk,DroidTHX1138,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:25:45 2015 UTC,"Damn. I change my oil for 40 bucks, that's how much 5 quarts of synthetic Mobile One and filter cost. And that's every 10k miles because synthetic is the shit. But anyway, yeah it could be the filter. It would be worth changing to the K&N one anyway, save time and money plus you could see if it fixes the issue. If not just wait to take it in to the dealer. It could be something else. Hell you may have even accidentally put the filter in backwards, who knows?   And no. Go with the K&N plus the cleaning kit. You won't buy another filter again ever since it's washable, so it may be a high initial investment, but trust me, it's worth it. Really high quality product."

You will not find a decent CBA for less than $65k. If you think you've found one (even with low mileage), expect to spend an extra $10k+ in the first year on transmission, suspension and brake repairs. DBA's will run you about $70k+.

I have beat the living dog piss out of it the last 10k miles with 0 issues.   The only know issues with the vq is the upper timing chain wearing through the guides. You sound mechanically inclined so replacing them is easy.   Beyond that i have friends and cars I've worked on at nissan with well over 200k.  There was an 02 altima se that had 450k on it that was a regular customer. Also a maxima that put on 190k in a year in a half (traveling salesmen).   Run 5 or 10w40 in it and regular maintenance and it will last you no problem.

Yeah the thing looks killer, and like I said, a naturally aspirated v6 sounds nice right now. Even though I haven't really had any issues with my current turbocharger.   I am a little mechanically inclined but don't have the proper tools or space right now, so the timing chain thing would probably have to be done by a garage.   Also...the SE-R looks pretty killer too, the one I was looking at is an 06 and the interior is sick. Also love the wheels."

Also, as far as I know, all models will potentially have an issue with the clutch Concentric Slave Cylinder (CSC) breaking, which will cost quite a bit to fix.  For more info on that, just Google ""Nissan 370 CSC"".    If you plan on tracking the car, you will want to get an aftermarket oil cooler to keep the oil temps down.

If you plan on  modifying the suspension, you'll probably be fine with just a base w/ sport package.  At the bare minimum, get the sport package so that you get the LSD.    I wasn't planning on messing with the suspension, so I went with the NISMO, since it already has the upgraded, more aggressive suspension. And when I say aggressive, I mean that you will feel EVERY bump.  I've already replaced the exhaust (Fast Intentions resonated test pipes and cat-back exhaust) and switched the air filters with K&N drop-in filters.  Future mods include possibly upgrading to the Stillen Gen 3 intakes and painting or switching out the headlights with the 2015+ NISMO lights.  I'd love to throw a twin-turbo kit on there someday, but I doubt it will actually happen."

Nissan,394cn5,efects,2,Tue Jun 9 13:23:49 2015 UTC,"if you're not planning to track the car, there's almost nothing wrong with it in stock form, minus possible issues with the CSC going bad prematurely, and the steering wheel lock problem as /u/swiss_cheese already described.  but if you plan to drive the car hard, then there's lots of things that will fail you almost off the bat:   differential bushing is a silicon filled sac. it will fail, very, very quickly. mine failed after my first track day and 30k miles of easy driving. replacement is cheap...~$100, but involves removing the entire differential and likely takes about 4 labor hours the factory VLSD will fail within 50k miles as well and become an open differential due to overheating during normal driving due to the stock rear suspension design, you will either need to swap to a ""true"" coilover where the strut and spring are one, and buy a replacement toe arm with toe lockout plates to avoid toe changes during hard driving or buy the SPL mid-link bucket which is costly  you'll need a 34 row oil cooler as the car will hit limp mode after a single lap - $600 upgrade the radiator while you're at it, because the coolant runs way too hot - $600 you'll need brake cooling, stillen's kit is ~$300, high temp pads - i like carbotech's - $400 flush the brake and clutch fluid with something like motul rbf600 to prevent brake failure   again, in stock form, the car is great, if you're just going to DD it. once you start driving it hard, things will start to fail you left and right"
Nissan,394cn5,efects,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:16:55 2015 UTC,I've thought about tracking it for some fun but if there really is that many things that could go wrong I may shy away from that until I'm confident I can take on the costs.
Nissan,394cn5,Ima_PenGuinn,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:19:00 2015 UTC,"to be honest, if you're going to do one or two track days over the life of the car, its not a big deal, but there are definitely things that come with constant tracking. you'll run into overheating issues firstly (coolant and oil) and dangerous braking problems - stock pads will be worn down to the backing plate after 1, 20min session  note: i have a '10 nismo, fully modded for the track and its a pain in my wallet haha"

Nissan,391oyp,FlipCup88,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:38:53 2015 UTC,"It should handle just fine. AWD and 4WD is essentially the same thing (unless you consider a typical truck 4WD setup to be 4WD). The main difference really is with 4WD will have a switch to keep it either 2WD, 4 High and 4 Lo. Though AWD does have AWD Lock switch, which will lock 50% power to front and back, otherwise the module will decide how to distribute power based on conditions.  I can't say how it fairs beach driving, but it handles well in Snowy/Icy conditions on broken Michigan roads, so I imagine beach should be OK.   I would heavily recommend(for any car driving on a beach) taking a hose and rinsing off all the salt water and sand afterwards, then take it to a car wash and get the works."

I've never been a fan of the unpainted cf hood as I personally feel like it's an area that should be the same color as the rest of the body, but that's probably the only thing I'd do differently. I don't even hate it on your car, I just wouldn't do it to mine.   But the Lamborghini color...I've been in love with that color since the first time I saw it on the Murcielago. There couldn't have been a better color choice for this car. Love the dry carbon side mirrors (wrap I'm assuming?) And the shape of the steering wheel. Did they flatten the top of the wheel a bit or are they all shaped like that? Also, are the seats stock? Because holy shit they're really stepping up their game if so."

Nissan,38vmsd,TheRealSpaceTrout,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:04:03 2015 UTC,"I used to work for Nissan, so I knew I had to get something from them. I'm totally a performance car guy. The two cars I was looking into other than the Juke are the 2015 STI and older Evos. But I just love the Juke. They're all so much fun to drive, especially the new RS. Watch almost any review of the RS, and they'll try to hate it. But when you see someone driving it, they're loving it. It's pretty lightweight, so it doesn't need very much power. It has a relatively wide track, so it handles extremely well. I know a guy who owns a few supercars, and last week he gave me a couple hours behind the wheel of his Ferrari 458. One thing I was noticing is that, despite the major difference in power and center of gravity, the Juke handles pretty similarly on mountain roads. Just very well balanced. Definitely an intelligently put-together car.  And I love how people react to it. Most people are confused when they see it, and some people lose their shit when they see it (some of whom I would assume think it's a Juke-R).  I just think it's a cool, unique car, that's a total blast to drive. And it's more practical than a 370Z ;)"

There are some little areas where corners were cut that might be important to you (no auto roll down / up passenger window, no lock on glove compartment, 2014 SV trim no heated seats [2015 has them though], US models don't have windshield washer fluid low sensor, doesn't do HD radio, power driver seat does not tilt).  If none of that stuff is important I am sure you will really enjoy the car.  I have one and it has worked well for me so far with 17k miles on it.  This wouldn't really compare to a Grand Cherokee though.  The Rogue is smaller and compares to a Cherokee.  The Grand Cherokee equivalent would be the Pathfinder."

And then they focus the development on the interior and slightly improved V6 instead of possibly making the car RWD or manual. Why...? The last gen VQ35 was perfectly capable and reliable.  And then they have the balls to say that since the Maxima SR has monotube dampers it has torsional rigidity greater than the Porsche Cayman.

Nissan,38om92,TheRealSpaceTrout,0,Fri Jun 5 16:41:29 2015 UTC,Short Ram Intake gave me 1.5L/100km better fuel economy and better high end RPM power.  Also a very awesome turbo whirring/woosh sound!

The Recaro Sportsters are amazing, the interior trim is very nice and extremely high quality (especially for the price), I think it's one of the best value performance cars around.  Some people don't like the way it looks, and they, 90% of the time, haven't driven one ;). Not to mention, anyone who buys something this unique looking, didn't buy it for other's opinions.

Its quirky looking without being boring and ugly like the Scion xB/D or the Kia Rio.   Being turboed is a nice touch too.   The interior reminds me of the 3rd gen Altima, which I really like.  The only gripe I have with it is the cheap material quality, and the tiny 1.6l engine. Would be sweet with a turbo 2.5."

The effects are negligible for the price, and the numbers of ""hp gains"" for those bolt-ons are measured on a dyno with a huge fan blowing on the open engine, which of course is unrealistic. During actual driving, the SRI pipe will get hot and warm the intake, negating any gains from ""cold air"". To keep the pipe cool it needs a heat-reflective wrap/coating. Anyway, if you ever have an option for a custom tune/ECU reflash, go with that. Best bang for your buck with turbo vehicles.  edit: sorry, but what were they thinking with those wheels? yikes."

This shudder or low speed drone noise is normal.  Giving it a little bit of gas usually will stop the problem.  While a lot of altima owners complain about this,  we try to explain that it is a normal condition.  If you go to your dealership they may tell you the same thing.    I can tell you that nissan is working to correct this perceived problem.  Some of the older models have software updates and redesigned parts.  We replace a lot of cvts at our shop and a lot of them are for the low speed shudder.  I have a 15 altima waiting for a new cvt unit, which is back ordered for an undetermined amount of time.

Listen, I understand CAFE requirements and why Nissan (and everyone else, ultimately) is going to these goddam things. I understand they have a business to run and sales targets to make, and catering to the tiny fraction of drivers like me who want to feel connected to driving their cars makes no economic sense.

Nissan,38f62v,deafy_duck,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:25:56 2015 UTC,It'll work. There might be some parts that'll need to be moved over from the old engine but overall if they're both automatic motors then they should work fine. There's somebody who recently swapped in one of those Altima engines over at my6thgen and it worked fine.

Nissan,389gff,yourenotmydad,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:46:55 2015 UTC,"While I agree - you can still have fairly light BBS 19"" wheels, and the advantage of having larger wheels is that the sidewall will be smaller, which means less flex. I do like smaller wheels however, but the aesthetic appeal, and so on and so on"
Nissan,389gff,ConverseToothbrush,2,Wed Jun 3 04:00:47 2015 UTC,Sidewall is supposed to be part of the suspension though. Super stiff sidewalls have no place on the street IMO.
Nissan,389gff,yourenotmydad,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:30:57 2015 UTC,Just take in to consideration that the smaller wheels don't have a very big offset compared to 18's and  19's. But over 20's is a bit extensive.
Nissan,389gff,yourenotmydad,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:01:22 2015 UTC,"You can get any offset you want in any diameter you want if you have the money. The Vossens they are running aren't cheap at over $2k a set, you can easily find some 17 or 18's in any offset for that money."
Nissan,389gff,shishaboob,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:03:05 2015 UTC,what would you recommend instead and do you have any pictures so i can get a feel for what the fitment would look like? i feel like you would have to go super low to run 17s but i might be wrong.
Nissan,389gff,yourenotmydad,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:52:24 2015 UTC,"If you are worried about how low you look going to smaller wheels might not be for you. The way to get the lightest wheel for the money is to see how small of a wheel you can get to clear your brakes and still get decent tires.

Even the better models have cheap looking interiors. No excuse. The only issue I ever hear is that the Zs are starting to feel outdated.

Nissan,37wax9,nonbornking,1 point,Sun May 31 03:41:30 2015 UTC,"If all's well-maintained (that is really the crux of the issue, isn't it?), then the price seems fair to me.  There's the timing chain (not belt, that was pre-05) that will have to be addressed.  At least $1000 there.  It's a manual, so no SMOD issues for this car.  2nd-gen manuals are coveted in the X community, as you've probably discovered.  I can't speak to the TPMS, but makes sense if the new shoes don't have pressure sensors in them.  Also, I don't really know anything about air intakes and noises, so I can't offer an opinion there.

If you have a small screw driver and know what the AC pipes in the engine bay look like there should be 2 caps on the AC lines somewhere, undo either one of them and put the screwdriver in there to see if theres sufficient pressure being released.

Nissan,37rsrq,awdrift,2,Fri May 29 22:03:24 2015 UTC,Have you checked the fuses yet? Just because the light turns on doesn't mean the a/c system is getting power. If the fuses are fine take your multi-meter and check the voltages of the system. See if the compressor is even getting power.

Nissan,37mhji,Trn4mr,2,Fri May 29 21:33:16 2015 UTC,Is there a name for that type of wheel/tire set up? Looks different from ones you see normally. This would definitely be on my list of potential future projects if I ever do start one.

Nissan,37nm4l,swanzie,2,Thu May 28 23:28:53 2015 UTC,"I own a 2005 Frontier, so pretty much the same to an extent.  1.) Very comfortable ride, have taken many long trips over 6 hours in it, no back pain or anything from it.  2.)Can't comment on the sound system as I tore mine out the first week I purchased it, changed the head unit literally when I pulled her in the driveway. Really easy to add some decent speakers and head unit it the factory stuff isn't cutting it.  4.) I get about 16 city, 21 highway. Not great. It was killing me on my daily 50+ mile roundtrip commute. But I just bought a little sentra for that.   4.) Just about to hit 100k on mine, no issues so far. Had a battery go bad on me once and thats it. Haven't had any mechanical parts go bad. But I also take pretty good care of my vehicles.   5.) No major regrets but 4x4 would be nice, definitely get the crew cab if you can afford it. Wish I had the longbed CC model but they didn't introduce that until about 09~10."
Nissan,37nm4l,flopsweater,2,Fri May 29 14:03:44 2015 UTC,"Had an '07, upgraded to a Crew cab in '11 because kids.    It's comfy for a truck.  Not Lincoln-comfy, but who wants that?  Seats are good, although the cloth doesn't wear very well.  Go leather.   I average about 16.5mpg in the summer, and about 15 in the WI winter.    They were both very reliable - no issues.  But then, there shouldn't be on a 5 year old truck with one of Ward's 10 Best Engines in it (at least, it was in 2007).   The stereo with amp and sub is decent, but even if you don't get it, it's stupid-easy to put a head unit in.  The panel basically pops off and there's plenty of room.   Get the Utilitrack system and sliding bed extender.  It's not a proper Frontier without them, and it's just so handy to have a tie down anywhere you want one, plus an extra foot and a half of bed space when needed.   If you want a bed cover, Solid Fold is the only choice."
Nissan,37nm4l,gmann1139,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:02:09 2015 UTC,"I bought a 15 last November, so i can't comment on longterm reliability, but I have had zero issues so far.  I have the V6 with 4wd, and the mileage is sub-20.  Most of your other questions should be answered by a test drive or two.  I will say, I test drove the Tacoma (did not like the angle of the windshield), and Colorado (my last truck, but the new one did not work for me for several reasons) as well.  The Frontier should be much cheaper, but you do lose some features because of it."
Nissan,37nm4l,gmann1139,1 point,Fri May 29 13:32:21 2015 UTC,"I don't know, my dad has an 11 tacoma and my 05 frontier is a much nicer truck. His isn't comfortable at all, I was able to add all the features his has for not much (bluetooth stereo, backup camera, etc). Even he admits my truck is nicer but I guess his is the be base ex cab tacoma and I have the LE CC Frontier."
Nissan,37nm4l,raevnos,1 point,Fri May 29 14:06:06 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  My Frontier is the SE version with 'the package' because with the difference in cost versus what I was prepared to pay for the base version of the Colorado or Tacoma, I could afford to upgrade the Frontier.  The Tacoma and especially the Colorado just felt nice inside, more like an SUV and less 'truck-ish'.  Not an insult, just a difference."
Nissan,37muo7,DirtyMexican87,1 point,Thu May 28 20:04:59 2015 UTC,"Sway bars really tighten things up on a daily driver car. Polyurethane bushings replace all the rubber bushings (control arms, sway bar mounts, etc) and remove a lot of the excess flex from those components. For my 350z, I bought whiteline poylurethane bushing kit for the whole car, including the diff bushing. The difference isn't mind blowing but it is very noticeable. A stiffer sway bar should benefit me as well."

Nissan,37kyu5,spartan19,1 point,Thu May 28 11:42:55 2015 UTC,You're talking about the black bracket that the two positioning screws go through?   I did this back in the day.. It takes some crazy force to pry them apart. You literally just need to grab the bracket and the headlight and pull.
Nissan,37kyu5,ngknick,1 point,Thu May 28 12:41:08 2015 UTC,Yeah that's what I'm talking about. That won't break the plastic?
Nissan,37kyu5,zedshadows,2,Thu May 28 13:30:53 2015 UTC,It shouldn't. That bracket is held on by like a ball and socket type of joint so you just need to pull really hard to get the ball out of the socket.

Nissan,37kyu5,ngknick,1 point,Thu May 28 14:09:08 2015 UTC,I wish I had more pictures of the assembly. All I remember is that I had to just pull them apart pretty hard. That plastic piece on the screw Is what pushes and pulls the headlight to position it. It should pop out.

It was tragically lost in a late-night street race where he lost control.   He had no choice but to give the car up, it was totalled, and he couldn't afford to properly insure it. He uses the money he does get from the insurance company to buy this old Altima.  A couple days later he returns to the scene of the wreck and just happens to notice the badge lying in the gutter.   Still a Godzilla in spirit."

Nissan,37dhrp,FunkMetal804,1 point,Tue May 26 23:05:50 2015 UTC,"Well after much research and messing around I finally figured it out. Nope, the Maxima 2014 most def does not have an aux port - when I say aux port I'm talking about about the 3.5mm jack. They have that USB port in the console (is that also considered an aux port?). Anyway, I have a charging case on my iPhone with a different charging cable (not the standard apple charge cord). When i plugged it in, the car is supposed to just magically recognize it and you can start playing your music through the speakers but it didn't. Which led me to do all this research and make this post. Anyway, to make a long story longer, the light bulb when off in my very slow head and I tried taking my charging case off and using the original Apple iPhone cord. And voila it worked. So the lesson is if you have an iPhone and a charging case (like a mophie) on it take the case off and use the original apple charging cable to the USB port in your console.

Nissan,3710n1,everfallingdark,1 point,Sat May 23 21:26:48 2015 UTC,It could be the transmission unfortunately.  I just replaced an 08 pathfinder Trans last month and it came back in Friday with the Trans burnt up and barely moving.  We chocked it up to a bad Trans build from the factory( it was a reman unit).  I would suggest have nissan look at it.
Nissan,3710n1,DroidTHX1138,1 point,Sun May 24 10:30:57 2015 UTC,"Did you happen to look closely at the fluids?  The trans coolers in the radiators leak on these and destroy the transmissions.  If the radiator isn't replaced when this happens, you'll keep putting transmissions in."

Nissan,3710n1,DroidTHX1138,1 point,Thu May 28 02:40:43 2015 UTC,"Right, but the transmission cooler INSIDE the tank of the radiator is what fails.  99% of the time if a pathfinder/frontier/xterra has transmission issues, this is the culprit.

Nissan,3710n1,Brutl,1 point,Thu May 28 02:43:30 2015 UTC,No it didn't fail. The fluid was burnt not mixed.  (originally it was mixed and that's when we replaced everything.) the new rads don't typically fail.

Nissan,36oi6i,zimm3rmann,2,Thu May 21 04:56:56 2015 UTC,"Right on. I put down 10k, as I had some inheritance from a grandparent that my parents had held since I was very young, but I had been saving it for my first nice car. That combined with a pretty good credit score got me 0% financing. Looking at $314 for the next 60 months, not awful."
Nissan,36oi6i,Bloo25RS,3,Thu May 21 05:00:10 2015 UTC,Looks great! I really think the Sentra has improved looks wise above the rest of the cars in its class over the last few years.

Nissan,36nfzm,MiddyMcPinnerson,1 point,Wed May 20 19:21:12 2015 UTC,"Right?  As far as car parts go, that's like one of the most liquid assets you can have is those wheels lol, call it your emergency fund.  And it was a while ago but it was mainly caused by him being way too tired behind the wheel in the morning (not drunk).  He closed his eyes for a second, came to, realized he was headed straight for a utility pole, so his options in that split second were to either ram into it or hop over the median, he chose the hopping option, and idk it just wrecked it lol i don't know where it happened but i guess there was a nasty curb or something he hit hard.  Over $7k repair bill which cleaned his bank account"

Nissan,36patz,Ajs1004,1 point,Thu May 21 04:32:41 2015 UTC,"Definately get that engine code read. Is the ticking sound constant below 40mph. The ticking might be your Timing chain tensioner guard. I have that sound / issue with my 2005 Murano. I definately notice the sound more at lower speeds, especially when I'm barely applying pressure to the accelerator. Not a cheap fix from what I've read. Since mine murano is eating a bit of oil I notice the sound more when the oil is a little lower than it should be. Check oil levels/ top off and see if sound improves. The timing chain tensioner isn't a cheap fix from what i've read."
Nissan,36patz,Apostalos,1 point,Thu May 21 16:06:02 2015 UTC,The oil is full.  It is now surging on acceleration so I dont even know if I could drive it to get the codes read.

Nissan,36k4ty,thatlonelyasianguy,3,Wed May 20 05:31:01 2015 UTC,Needs lower offset wheels to push the tire more flush with the fenders.
Nissan,36k4ty,minizanz,1 point,Wed May 20 08:36:11 2015 UTC,that would ruin the aero kit and defeat the purpose of the lemans fender/skirt ducts.
Nissan,36k4ty,stfm,3,Wed May 20 09:24:25 2015 UTC,"Not really - the race version wore larger wheels and tyres that filled the guards up a lot more than the road version. Certainly no where near ""stance"" style though."
Nissan,36k4ty,thatlonelyasianguy,2,Wed May 20 13:02:35 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I wasn't suggesting ""hella flush stupid camber"" status."
Nissan,36k4ty,minizanz,0,Wed May 20 15:03:23 2015 UTC,it looks they have the wheels offset in that with wider or lower or lower offset fronts.

Nissan,36j0k8,lgilbertjr,3,Tue May 19 19:13:16 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for the Rogue but, I have 2 Nissans, a Datsun, and a 2013 Rav4, so I have a little experience with both brands. I love my Nissans (aside from my bitter feelings towards the Titan) they have been excellent so far. The Z has 100k miles and the Titan has 165k. But, they all seem to suffer from cheap interiors. In the month I have owned my 350Z, I have had to replace or cover interior pieces just to keep it looking sharp. The plastic scratches too easy, or discolors. My Titan rattles like crazy and the interior is just falling apart. Dash is cracking in the top, radio is going bad, seats are worn out etc. I take good care of all my cars and have had a Mazda 3 and an Acura TSX with twice as many miles as the 350Z and many more miles than the Titan, and neither of them suffered as badly as the Nissans have. My wife's Rav4, on the other hand, now has 40k miles on it and the interior still looks new aside from a minor key scratch from dropping her keys in the cup holder. No plastic discoloration at all. It is AWD and get about 25mpg in ECO mode, 23 in Normal, and 20-21 in Sport mode. It has plenty of ""get up and go"" for what it is but, I'm not impressed by any means. The only major complaint is the infotainment center. Bluetooth works but, it can get a little poppy from time to time and it has forgotten my phone multiple times. The Rav4 also feels heavier than it is. I suspect its due to the higher center of gravity and and softer suspension. So it's not very sporty. Its a great small family car/cuv/suv thingy but, not very fun when driven hard.    I wish I could have convinced my wife to go drive a Rogue, though. I love the way they look and would have loved to get the Nismo version but, she wanted nothing to do with it."

Nissan,36j0k8,zimm3rmann,1 point,Wed May 20 11:54:53 2015 UTC,"Can't really speak to Toyota, I sat inside one and I personally didn't care for it. However a lot of the features and options are pretty similar.   The rogue does do a bit better for Gas mileage. I did drive one (AWD) in Michigan winter and it did really great. Lot of head room too incase you are tall. It has both Eco and Sport mode buttons(not going to change driving drastically but will change throttle response a bit). You can get heated Cloth or Leather Seats too, All Around view monitor, plus other nice safety warning features.   Really I would recommend you drive both and see how you like them."
Nissan,36j0k8,Exolis87,1 point,Wed May 20 12:58:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks everyone so far for commenting. I drove the Rav4 last night and found the drive to be pleasurable and roomy. I am 6-1 so having plenty of room is important to me. I am looking at the Rogue SV with a moonroof. Everything I've read about the Rogue so far has been positive except the engine power issue. I will test it this weekend. I am familir with Nissan having owned the Maxima for 12 years. On the flip side, I've never owned a Toyota, but everyone I know that has one loves them and that they are reliable. With that said, I have found my Nissan to be reliable too outside of normal wear-and-tear items that need to be replace.   I started to look at a used Murano, but feel that the it's way more than I need and the price of a used Murano were in line with a new Rogue/Rav4.   Please continue the discussion."

Nissan,36dyrt,Erebus172,2,Tue May 19 03:51:41 2015 UTC,I hate to ask a stupid question but when was this?  I was up at the Dragon last Wednesday and I saw about 20 Z cars.  Mostly Z32s and Z33s but a few older models and 2 R35s.  I wondered why there were so many out there on a week day.

Court's ruled in owner's favor, as they provided adequate evidence that they tried to follow all laws.  Unfortunately this only applied to ""federalized"" cars, meaning they could pass EPA and DOT standards for a vehicle of their year.  No more R34's are legal until 25 years old with the exception of Show Only Import (Nismo and special models)."

Nissan,36eati,ntech5,3,Mon May 18 18:58:51 2015 UTC,With that year and that many miles and with it being a sporadic issue sounds to me like its a prime candidate for NTB 14-002b I would be installing an aux. transmission cooler along with performing a drain and refill on the cvt unit.   This may not throw a MIL but hooking up with consult III there is always going to be some kind of code. If you have an issue with that dealer and there are none other in the area please call consumer affairs and start a file. This is a known issue hence the TSB now since I do not have the vehicle in front of me this is only theoretical diagnosis. Hope this helps you
Nissan,36eati,zimm3rmann,1 point,Mon May 18 19:08:19 2015 UTC,thank you for the information! I am going to bring the car to another dealer tomorrow. I am going to call Nissan corporate to start the process

Nissan,36eati,t4d,1 point,Wed May 20 11:56:10 2015 UTC,Not even close to the same transmission but as fluid deteriorates any issue could arise causing a fail safe condition

Nissan,36eati,t4d,1 point,Mon May 18 21:55:30 2015 UTC,Fluid services are not covered under the extension customers must maintain fluid condition and level out of pocket. If the unit is bad it may be covered do not imply warranty coverage unless the vehicle is in front of you that is a bad practice and could potentially provide misinformation

Nissan,36bf92,Kanaric,1 point,Mon May 18 16:13:59 2015 UTC,"Well, it's not running the stock RB25DET ECU; it's on an a Z32 N/A with an Enthalpy daughter board, and two stage boost delete. The Wastegate actuator opens at 10psi, but it tends to creep when you're in second or third gear.   Apparently, the 25 turbo is a popular mod for RB20s. I hear you can run them at higher pressures because the RB20DET flows less air. Don't quote me though."

It bolts straight up and performance is pretty good. Been looking at getting a hi-flow rb25 turbo and then a nistune ECU + tune. That's what I would be doing if you want to run anymore than 12psi.

Nissan,36biq4,WesternStudentUWO,2,Tue May 19 15:49:51 2015 UTC,I have a 2007 Altima and I can confirm you do not need to remove your entire bumper. You have to remove 2 clips that are under the bumper and a couple of clips in the wheel well. Then you pull back the carpeting and you'll have access to the headlight. It's a pretty easy process and there are video's of people doing it on Youtube.

Nissan,366odi,astroman9995,3,Sun May 17 04:11:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, let me provide some more detail. It is getting increasingly more difficult every day to find one like you want at a reasonable price. The majority of early model GTRs going through auctions in Japan today either have rust, have been modified/raced, have been in accidents, or are generally in poor condition. Many of the decent ones have all been exported or are not currently for sale. The few stock, unmodified, and accident free 89/90 GTRs that do show up once and awhile are so desirable that the highest auction bid usually blows my mind. It is a little ridiculous to pay 16K+ car cost (before any export/import/reg fees) for a 25 year old car sight unseen that you don't really know anything about. Most of the time they require work, no matter how original or nice they may look.   The last two GTRs I brought stateside were 99% original and nearly mint inside and out and they costed a good amount. Both of them still needed 1-2K of work and maintenance once they arrived.    If you really want a GTR at a lower price point, a good option is to find a semi-modified one in OK condition and refurbish it over time. Many of my buddies are doing this and it is really fun! Otherwise pay the premium for a nice one."

If its the first then don't drive your car like that, its a 15 year old SUV, not a brand new race car. Of course its going to shake if you floor it."
Nissan,35wb69,Rebelord92,1 point,Thu May 14 13:50:48 2015 UTC,"Sounds like two issues here.  First the shake can be a simple balance issue with the tires, to a worn component issue. Such as ball joints, tie rod ends etc. Drive it on the highway and observe and feel for the shake. If its smooth until 75 then most likely a tire balance. Probably would smooth out by going a little faster.  However not many highways have that high of a speed limit.  So follow all laws. Having a tire shop check and balance your tires is cheaper and safer.   Secondly sounds like your transmission may have flared. Basically when it was supposed to shift it didn't and you hit the Rev limiter. Being a 2001 you should have the 3.5. Troubleshooting can be done. But you need to follow the factory service manual.   I recommend to head over to NPORA forums and read up. In the garage section there is a link to the full fsm for your truck. Feel free to join and ask questions."

Nissan,35v85v,kuroyume_cl,1 point,Thu May 14 15:02:51 2015 UTC,"That knock you hear is just the valve clattering on the valve cover, and my buddy mechanic considers it normal, especially when it gets cold. He mentioned that when using synthetic, it would reduce the noise, and when the engine temperature warms up, it disappears, or you won't hear it as much. The QR25DE engine was originally designed as the engine for the Frontier pickup truck, before it expanded its use to the Altima, Sentra SE-R, and Rogue.  As for the CVT itself, the 2007-2009 model years on the 2.5 models will have the issues you have, especially on the early models. If it's whining, and if it's giving you shuddering, then you may have to get the transmission replaced.  There's an extended warranty on CVTs for 2007-2010 models that is 10 years/120,000 miles, so if it goes kaput, turn it in for warranty replacement.  As for the downshift you mentioned, you may be referring to the engine braking at less than 30 mph/50 km/h. That's considered normal, since the CVT does that to assist in braking.  The CVT NS-2 fluid comes green when clean, and goes to a golden brown when used. Whether it's drain and fill, or a flush, the intervals should be every 60,000 miles.  I hope that helps! Good luck!"

I'm not sure of your financial situation, but if you're concerned about the upfront price of a GT-R, the maintenance costs are going to be worse in a location where there are only a handful of dealerships.   If you're concerned about the upfront cost of a GT-R, I wouldn't buy one at all, given your location. I have a 2015 GT-R in the US. I've already gone through one set of tires and two oil changes.

The GXE had the QG18DE and the SE model (00-01) had an SR20DE (not the coveted one). It would not be possible to mix all the parts together to make one engine as they just aren't interchangeable.  If they were referring to aesthetics then that is entirely possible. Almost all the body and interior pieces were interchangeable. The question there would be, why the hell would you do that.   Now you can take later model QR parts and make the QR slightly more reliable (not much but a little). 07 was the year the spec v engine really got the improvements.

That doesn't take away from the fact that they really don't have a ton of redeeming qualities.   If you decide to buy the car, obviously, that's your choice but, I can't tell you how many of those cars have come into my shop with the new owner saying something very similar to what you are now. My recommendation would be to look for a different make/model all together."

Nissan,35qfox,jocker12,1 point,Wed May 13 01:40:38 2015 UTC,"mine looks like the top one with three buttons.  the SPA2406  Edit: you asked which feature.. I apologize.  I thought I was clear in my original post, but re-reading it now, I never really did describe exactly what I want to disable.  Oops!    When you hold down the unlock button on the key fob, it will roll the windows down.  I want to disable this."
Nissan,35qfox,SgtBrowncoat,1 point,Wed May 13 01:45:31 2015 UTC,I wish my Nissan had that.  It is great for letting the hot air out of the car in the summer before you get in.
Nissan,35qfox,SgtBrowncoat,1 point,Wed May 13 05:30:30 2015 UTC,"it sounds nice, but the reality is, we never use it.  I've shifted position in my chair with my keys in my pocket and accidentally rolled them down more times than we've done it on purpose.    This leaves the car not just unlocked, but visibly vulnerable sitting in my driveway with a garage door opener in it.  Not to mention, at least twice that I can remember that it's rained in the unintentionally opened windows.    Even worse is that the opposite function, to roll UP the windows doesn't exist.  This would be far more useful.  When you look out and realize it's raining and your windows are down, it would be nice to be able to roll them up without having to run outside in the rain, open the door and let yourself in, poke the start button to get the car going, roll the windows up, open the door again and run back through the rain to get inside.  Without the UP feature, the DOWN feature is just dumb."
Nissan,35qfox,Exolis87,1 point,Wed May 13 13:44:34 2015 UTC,What about a case for your remote that would help keep buttons from being pushed?
Nissan,35qfox,pihwlook,1 point,Wed May 13 14:24:39 2015 UTC,"that's honestly not a terrible idea.  I rarely use any of the buttons on the fob at all.  I know the simplest and cheapest solution is to just hang my keys up when I get home, but my keys rarely leave my pocket.  I usually put them in the cargo pocket on my shorts and they don't come back out.  Between the Murano just needing it to be near and a keypad on my front door, I just don't use my keys.  Something that protected all the buttons would be a good idea.  If it exists."
Nissan,35qfox,jocker12,1 point,Wed May 13 14:33:52 2015 UTC,"So by regulation, the Up function cannot be allowed in US. I think it exists on other regions. But the main reason is the fact Anti-Pinch is disabled during key function, so if something or someone was in the way, it would cause some damage/injury."
Nissan,35qfox,Exolis87,1 point,Wed May 13 18:21:20 2015 UTC,"That almost makes sense.  I can understand why you would want the anti-pinch for sure.  But what you're saying is that it's disabled when using the key fob?  So it's there.  It exists, but only when you use the switch on the door and not when you use the fob?  That logic alone would make having the down without the up even dumber."
Nissan,35qfox,jocker12,1 point,Wed May 13 18:39:16 2015 UTC,"I have this, live in san diego, and use it all the time. Letting the car start to cool off as you approach it is great.  However, I have also always wanted the additional functionality of being able to roll the windows back up from the fob."

Nissan,35mt56,SoullessPolack,3,Mon May 11 20:09:32 2015 UTC,You could try a product such as chemiweld or equivalent. Its about $10-20. Add it to the cooling system and run it for about a week and then dump all the coolant and replace it with new. It can fix it for a few years or do nothing at all depending how bad the leak is but it's worth a try.
Nissan,35mt56,rollinwinnies,3,Tue May 12 06:13:57 2015 UTC,"Did that a year ago to an 86 Honda Accord I have and it worked good enough, engine still runs and no longer smokes. But then again its a dirt race car thats not worth anything more than scrap value. Don't know if I would put it in a $10k car though.. Might be worth getting a quote from an independent mechanic. But hey it will work if you are desperate and broke."
Nissan,35mt56,5523Motorsports,2,Tue May 12 13:44:33 2015 UTC,"The car is worth approximately what you owe on it. Head gaskets are not something to let go.

It comes bundled with the aftermarket ecu and you can use it to tune, and to monitor other things as well such as timing, fuel injector duty, knock sensors, intake air temps etc.  The one in the middle is a Greddy Profec EBC display - it controls the aftermarket electronic boost controller, and you can also use it as a boost gauge to either monitor your boost as a conventional boost gauge, or to generate a graph of boost to monitor any boost issues. The graph is really handy for identifying boost creep issues or boost spike issues, and lets you tune accordingly to get rid of those issues!"

The CVT on 2.5 L engines, which includes both the Rogue and the Altima 2.5 had issues between 2007 and 2009.

Nissan,35jqmc,roflstomp,1 point,Mon May 11 19:44:30 2015 UTC,"Rogue owner here (2008) - whining on acceleration is one of the signs of a potentially failing CVT - but not the only one.  I had mine replaced under warranty (symptoms included whining over 3k rpm, a howling noise and bubbles in the CVT fluid when whining was audible).  I still notice a faint whining noise over 3k rpm under certain circumstances that started a few months after the replacement.  The same dealer road tested it and didn't think it was an immediate issue (the tech indicated that a 'howling' noise, aka loud bearing, is generally the primarily-used acoustic failure indicator).  Keep in mind that your CVT is under warranty for 10 years from date of first purchase/delivery or 120,000 mi, whichever comes first.  Did you get your CVT fluid tested around 60,000 mi? as per Nissan's maintenance schedule?"

I loved that car, and once I replaced it, I passed it along to someone else who drove it past 300k miles.  Recently, I decided to pick up another Sentra of the same generation (aka B13,) but I wanted the SE-R. I found a nice, clean, one and got it about 2 months ago. here's a photo album. My profile has some other photos too. I've done a few mods on it, and hope to do some autocross with it, or maybe do some high performance driving school or something.  Yours looks like a nice clean car with good paint, and I hope it serves you well! I'm jealous that your steering wheel looks like it's not sun damaged. I'd guess that the previous owner tried to make it look like an SE-R by adding the spoiler, but that engine is definitely the GA16 and not the SR20. It's good that yours doesn't have a sunroof, since they have a history of leaking, and parts are increasingly hard to find. Other problem spots include rust in the rocker panels, sagging doors due to worn/rusty hinges, and ""5th gear pop-out"" which I haven't personally encountered.  I like that these cars can still be found in good shape, and really have lots of modding potential. You can do anything from keeping it as a bone-stock daily to a quick little sleeper (as I plan to) or you can go all out, and ditch the 110hp GA for a 145hp SR20DE (as came stock in the SE-Rs) or even go to an SR20VE with 187hp or even a 200hp+ SR20DET. Of course these numbers aren't terribly impressive by themselves until you factor in how lightweight these cars are."
Nissan,35gzo8,vayneblade,2,Mon May 11 14:11:50 2015 UTC,"Nice, I really wanted an SE-R but more for the look and not the engine itself, the better gas mileage will be nice. I might cheat and add some SE-R badges though (it can be our secrete haha). I was at a u pull yard yesterday and there was SE-R with a sunroof that was siliconed shut, so yes kind of glad not to have. Can definitely tell the doors are a little saggy but luckily 5th works for now but won't be the end of the world if 4th goes out. Probably won't do any performance mods but definitely want to restore her to her formy glory.  Thanks for sharing!"
Nissan,35gzo8,vayneblade,1 point,Mon May 11 14:35:13 2015 UTC,"Cool! You may want to actually extract those SE-R badges from the salvage yard, since they can't be found new any longer (probably because of posers like you! jk.) When the last guy had the silver sprayed on my car's top half, he decided that he wanted newer, chrome badges, so mine only has the fender SE-R badges. Once I eventually repaint the car myself, I plan to fashion SE-R badges from the (still available) oem ""SENTRA"" badges."
Nissan,35gtf8,Jonny_Challenger,2,Sun May 10 05:23:36 2015 UTC,You can grab a LSD carrier from any pathy at a junk yard or a v6 hardbody pickup. You can as fairly easily swap in a pathy rear axle. Rigs with HG axle codes are usually LSD and many LSD axe have a sticker on them that says LSD.

Nissan,35gtf8,deerhurst,1 point,Sun May 17 01:01:56 2015 UTC,"Break away? Holding strength? Thence in my hardbody is far, far stronger than that. It will move the truck with 2 opposing wheels on the ground."
Nissan,35gtf8,Rebelord92,1 point,Sun May 17 01:29:17 2015 UTC,Yup. The older ones were much stronger. But post 95? They got weaker.   If your on NPORA then you already know.  My 99 Pathfinder is around 75lbs but my 04 is literally 50lbs. Hardly a lsd at all.
Nissan,35gtf8,92PathSE,1 point,Sun May 17 01:45:14 2015 UTC,Been a while since I've been on NPORA. I'm usually on Infamous as I have an 86.5 hardbody. It is a Japan built truck so that could have something to do with it.
Nissan,35gtf8,deerhurst,1 point,Sun May 17 02:45:05 2015 UTC,Never been to Infamous. Even the Pathfinder was Japan built until 04/05 for the R50. The only 05 R50 are over seas. None in NA region.  No one knows why they lessened the torque on em. Only thought is because they started to compete with the likes of the Ford Explorer. They wanted to appeal more to easy family SUV? Versus a more dedicated off roader.   But then they did make the Xterra more for that. Which is more like a hard body. Shared frame with it and Frontier even to this day.
Nissan,35fowg,sketchanderase,2,Sat May 9 22:20:27 2015 UTC,"ASE Certified Master Technician and Advanced Level Specialist, Nissan Senior Specialist here. The code should read P2A00, is for the AIR/FUEL Sensor, NOT an O2 sensor, an air/fuel sensor does not switch like an O2 sensor does, with your live data reading on your scan tool watch the air/fuel sensor (may possibly be listed as ""Bank 1 Sensor 1 O2"" due to you using a generic scan tool) and the value for the air/fuel sensor should be fluctuating around 2.2v @ 2000RPM. If your not within near 2.2v, you should check for any possible intake air leaks AFTER the Mass Air Flow Sensor (maf to throttle plate) or any other possible air leaks. If you find none you probably just have a bad air/fuel sensor, but I wouldn't replace it until you have diagnostics done by a Professional. I don't have access to my technical resources right now, so I'm not able to look up and see if there is any technical bulletins issues by Nissan over this code."

Nissan,354pnp,FunkMetal804,3,Thu May 7 02:12:54 2015 UTC,You may need to add some brake fluid. The light comes on when the fluid level shifts as you make a turn.
Nissan,354pnp,joshisneat,3,Thu May 7 02:38:38 2015 UTC,Your brake fluids might be low or something with your brakes are functioning wrong. Take it to the dealer. Warranty should cover it.

Nissan,354pnp,bchiz10,2,Thu May 7 03:31:30 2015 UTC,"It does this when your brake fluid is registering low, however its important to note that your brake light is registering low because your brake pads are nearly spent. When you press the brake (often while cornering or stopping) and the pads are worn down, the fluid drops lower than it would if they were new because the pistons have to travel further to get to the rotors. This is a common way for OEMs to notify you that your pads are worn because you need this sensor anyways.  TL;DR: Change your pads."
Nissan,354pnp,labatomi,1 point,Thu May 7 04:20:18 2015 UTC,Change your break pads. Your fluid is registering  low because  the fluid has to travel further down the line to conpensate for the bads being worn.

Nissan,34gtzl,skelroth,1 point,Fri May 1 04:08:27 2015 UTC,"It's gonna take a bit of work, or a bit of money but it's absolutely worth it.  I have a z32 myself and love the car. Mines an auto, and the trans just failed after 280,xxxkm, was going to do a manual swap but managed to find a cheap auto trans ($120 delivered, wooo).  It all comes down if it's worth it to you, I'd value the swap about $1200-1700. Run your numbers and then double it just incase. Zeds never end up cheap, but they do end up worth the time investment, magnificent cars."
Nissan,34gtzl,Kanaric,2,Fri May 1 04:17:58 2015 UTC,"What exactly goes into the swap? Can the frames accept transmission components from both, or does a little bit of custom work have to be done to get the manual to fit?  1200-1700 is a pain in the ass but if the crankshaft works it's definitely worth considering imo  Edit: it's a Z31 if that makes a difference"

Im my experience credit unions have the better rates, so keep that in mind. As for how often that offer comes around, I'd say every year when the new models come out around fall. If I were you i wouldn't get a brand new car because as soon as you drive it off the lot it'll lose a couple grand in value. Both vehicles I have were current year with about 6,000 miles and I paid about $3,000 less than a brand spakin' new one. If you really want to go ahead with the brand new one 2016 models should already by up for order now or should be within a few months. I think they start arriving at dealerships around October."
Nissan,345o0j,cozmcjewshzombe,1 point,Tue Apr 28 22:27:07 2015 UTC,"That all depends on your credit score, I've seen it as low as 2.49% and as high as 29.6%. If your score is 750ish you'll be able to get an ok rate at a dealer but you're still better going to a credit union or bank for financing."
Nissan,345o0j,cozmcjewshzombe,1 point,Tue Apr 28 22:52:48 2015 UTC,"Along with your credit score, the total amount of money you have borrowed is also a fairly large factor when looking at financing. You can have a 750ish credit score from paying a $2000 loan and a $3000 loan back, and they will limit your options of financing $25,000.  Also, go credit union when it comes to anything. They are controlled by the unions members instead of CEOs, and often have better rates, customer service, lower fees. Even if you don't want to bank with a credit union, take your loans from them. It will save you many headaches."
Nissan,345o0j,Cassidius,0,Tue Apr 28 23:05:55 2015 UTC,"Im biased to credit unions because I work at one but I try to be unbiased when comparing them to banks, which is hard lol. If you only have 2 small loans your credit score wont go that high,especially if they are unsecured loans, but you will be around 700(Im guessing here) after paying them off with no late payments. The reason you would be limited to $25K would be a number of reason like credit score, length of employment, amount you make, and your debt to income ratio."
Nissan,345o0j,cozmcjewshzombe,1 point,Fri May 1 06:06:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you are actually pretty close. Mine was around 700 when I was in this circumstance a couple of years ago.

Nissan,345o0j,Cassidius,1 point,Fri May 1 13:46:32 2015 UTC,"Thank you, that's really helpful. I'm assuming there's something in the fine print to indicate whether or not the rate is good for one year or for the duration of the loan?"
Nissan,345o0j,cozmcjewshzombe,0,Tue May 5 14:42:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, it may be hard to find honestly or it could be in plan sight, just make sure to ask tons of questions. 0% well never be for the life of the loan but it'll probably be about 6 months to a year."

Nissan,345o0j,cozmcjewshzombe,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:39:51 2015 UTC,"I was searching through some old posts and saw this and wanted to comment.  We just purchased a Nissan with the 0% and there is no increase in that interest at all at any point.  Perhaps it does differ based on credit score and history, but a blanket statement like that isn't accurate.  The catch the the 0% financing is you lose most cash incentives the company may be offering.  So you have to weigh the difference between paying no interest over the term of the loan or receiving the incentive discount.  There are plenty of calculators out there on the web to help with this."
Nissan,345o0j,gizombie,1 point,Wed Apr 29 12:02:32 2015 UTC,Hmmm I have honestly never heard of anything like that but it does make sinse.

Nissan,342q86,traxtar944,3,Mon Apr 27 21:07:33 2015 UTC,"MOAR PICS HERE!!!  This car has been my pride and joy for years... I have invested hundreds of hours doing the all the work below, since I'm the type of person who feels that the only way to ensure the work is done right is to do it myself. Countless invested in parts and time. The car has more new parts than used, including the transmission, axles, brake system, intake, exhaust, full suspension, paint, complete interior, audio system, battery, etc... almost all those parts have ~20K miles on it or less. The only major component original to the car is the motor, glass, doors, body, and frame, and even the motor and glass have new gaskets.  The transmission was originally a 4 speed automatic, and I replaced it with a 5 speed manual from an SE model that had the rare limited slip option. All gears were checked to be within tolerance. New axles, CV joints, and wheel bearings have been installed as well. The car is a blast to drive with the new transmission. It's truly the 4 door sports car it was meant to be. An Exedy stage 1 clutch, aluminum flywheel, polished bell-housing (needs a re-do after some oxidation), new master and slave clutch, and stainless hydraulic lines were all installed less than 10K miles ago. The aluminum flywheel lets the transmission wind up so fast that 1st gear is almost non-existent... amazingly fast off the line. Redline MT-90 gear oil and Castrol hydraulic fluid are used and keep things working smoothly. New thicker axles and ARP extended wheel studs on all 4 corners are used, along with aluminum wheel nuts. Tenzo Type R wheels and Continental ExtremeContact DWS tires are brand new, less than 5K miles.  The custom brake system consists of stock parts from different high-performance cars. The front brakes are 4 piston 300ZX TT calipers and 2004 Mustang Cobra 13"" rotors with a CNC'd steel spacer to get the caliper at the correct distance for full pad bite. The rear brakes are stock maxima calipers with larger diameter 1988 300ZX rotors for a perfectly balanced system. Fully stainless steel wrapped brake lines throughout. Castrol fluid only. This is the ultimate setup for the 3rd gen maxima.  Custom cold-air intake is routed into the front fender and the K&N filter is protected from water intrusion by the wheel well liner. The 2.5"" exhaust has a hi-flow catalytic converter, custom y-pipe, and Magnaflow muffler for improved flow.   Suspension has been totally overhauled, and is easily one of the best features of the car. This thing handles like it's on rails, with almost zero body roll. The only thing that could be added in a x-frame. BlehmCo heim joints, control arm frame brace, solid sway bars, and strut tower bars on front and back, Tokico and Koni struts, and Eibach springs make the complete package. Every rubber bushing has been upgraded with polyurethane, greased for zero squeaks. I originally had B&G 2"" lowering springs on the car but it was too stiff for daily driving (though a much better look).  The interior is, again, totally custom. The car was stripped inside and out for paint and body work, and I found a local Nissan dealership with leftover graphite grey leather skins that were a dealer-only option, and installed them over new black carpet for an contrasting look. The headliner and pillars were stripped and covered with black alcantara material. Matching floor mats are included. Every interior light, including the HVAC controls and gauge backlighting has been replaced with LEDs. The main gauges have an electro-luminescent cover added that glows red/blue at night when the headlights are turned on. I've also added switched blue LEDs to all 4 foot-wells and inside the vents for a pretty cool effect at night. The Gauge pods lights are also on that same switch. A Momo steering wheel is mated to an NRG quick-release hub for sporty look and added security. NRG products are also used for the carbon shift knob, and e-brake handle. A custom black leather shifter boot with graphite french seams finish it off nicely.  Audio system is one of the best I've ever heard. The entire car was insulated in Damplifier Pro when the interior was out, and all wires were replaced with 10 gauge RCA's for amps and speakers. The amps are fused and powered/grounded by 0 gauge wire. Diamond Audio amps with JL audio subs and Cadence competition component speakers sound fantastic. A Pioneer premier touchscreen head-unit with GPS, DVD, HD Radio, and iPod connector is included. Absolutely zero rattles at full power. The car has been fitted with a CrimeStopper alarm with extra distance (1 mile) and tilt-sensor (no stolen wheels) add-on.  Exterior has been fully stripped, dents filled, primed, wet-sanded, and painted with a Mercedes Designo Mystic White with 2 base coats of white and 3 coats of clear. Truth be told, I have not even buffed this car yet after the paint. It looks amazing as-is, and I can't imagine what a good buff would do. The trunk reflector was deleted replaced with a sheet-metal fill panel in the paint process and really transforms the rear end into something totally unrecognizable. An ultra-rare Stillen fiberglass spoiler and commonly-used lip kit really make the car something else. I grafted on BMW side mirrors with turn indicators for a modern look.

Nissan,33ypk0,Thursdayftw,2,Tue Apr 28 16:55:57 2015 UTC,"Bingo - The Coupe to me is like a great GT car, with the VQ35 you get awesome power, and it's extremely comfortable to drive for a long time.  The SE-R is tuned differently, the exhaust note gives me a semi every time I hear it, and the brakes are WAY better, and it corners way better.  If I had to pick between them, I would just say I wish they made a coupe version of the SE-R!"

Nissan,33vodi,EricJ17,4,Sun Apr 26 01:57:02 2015 UTC,"Not that interesting of a story, but it was a bit of a journey to get here. Last August I totaled my '03 Civic Hybrid on my way home from working on my '88 GTA. I loved that Civic and was really upset about losing it. I was also afraid to drive anything without airbags, as I'm rather certain they prevented me from getting more severe injuries (I broke my collar bone, but otherwise was ok) so I sold the GTA. I knew I was going to be really bored if I got a boring commuter car as my only car, so I bought a brand new FR-S. Before buying the car I made sure to check the resale value, just in case, and it looked fine. Long story short, I hated the car as a daily driver and on long trips, which I take a lot of, but nothing is more fun to drive around town in. I also felt like I had overpaid for the car so I decided to try to sell it, and of course the resale value went to hell right around the same time. I ended up going to the Buick dealership about 2 weeks ago with the intention of getting one of the $200/month 0 down Veranos, but I ended up looking around a little and I got the Altima. I've always been a Nissan guy. It's just a 2.5S with the power seats, floor mats, and mud guards, but it's just nice. I've only put around 50 miles on the car, but I love it. I already like it more than I liked the FR-S, but it certainly can't ""replace"" the car. They're obviously extremely different. My plan is to get a 350z as soon as I can afford it though. :)"

Nissan,33obnv,King_Jack,3,Fri Apr 24 06:30:24 2015 UTC,I see a lot of videos of GT-R drivers that can't handle the car. Sadly I have never driven one myself but I would really like to know: is it so hard to handle?
Nissan,33obnv,Schnabulation,1 point,Fri Apr 24 07:40:40 2015 UTC,"Stock gtrs...  Pretty easy to control. Once you modify them,  can get a bit tougher."

Nissan,33obnv,Schnabulation,1 point,Fri Apr 24 11:37:16 2015 UTC,Yeah the 4wd system keeps you in line.  Daily driven a 32 gtr for awhile with some mods...  Driving was no harder than any normal sedan but a damn sight quicker when you wanted it to be.
Nissan,33obnv,brownyR31,1 point,Fri Apr 24 12:20:38 2015 UTC,Don't you think there is a difference between a R32 and a R35? Speaking about weight f.e.  I drive a RWD Z32 TT and find it quite easy to drive.
Nissan,33obnv,Schnabulation,1 point,Fri Apr 24 15:32:29 2015 UTC,The 35 is much easier to drive I find.  On full boost the 32 wants to move around a bit and you do have to hold it steady. 35... You can do it with one finger. It's so easy to drive fast in a 35 its scary.
Nissan,33obnv,brownyR31,1 point,Fri Apr 24 22:54:54 2015 UTC,"I always hear about how easy to drive GTR's are. I drove my dad's R32 GTR on he track recently and couldn't agree more with that statement. And then I was a witness to this. A guy brought his brand new GTR out to one of the local autocross events. We had 5 heats. The first 3 laps he skidded off course as though he was driving on dirt. On the 4th lap, one of the officials got in the driver seat with the owner in the passenger seat, so as to explain how to drive the car. Finished the lap with an amazing time for that day. 5th lap, the owner drove the car and managed to finish his lap while staying on track. His time wasn't stellar, I saw civics, s2ks and bimmers that were faster than this guy. The moral here is that you can't just buy a sports car and expect it to change who you are, and enhance how you drive. Unless you respect your vehicle enough to learn how to drive it and to learn its limits, you will never grow and find your own limits. No matter what dream car it is that you bought, you will remain the same person that grew up driving that Honda accord, just with a $100,000 less in the bank, unless you learn to drive that car. Case in point, this guy in the video."
Nissan,33obnv,sdhu,1 point,Fri Apr 24 11:51:16 2015 UTC,"Sadly I have never driven one myself but I would really like to know: is it so hard to handle?   I don't know if the people commenting have extensive experience driving them, but that's nonsense about it being super easy to drive. If you're cruising along and driving at 50% of its capabilities, yes, it's easy to control. But, if you're driving to the extent that the GT-R was designed for, it's very easy to break traction and spin out. On twisty roads it's very easy to break free. I've nearly lost control a few times when I was feeling a bit cocky. On straightaways it's easy to handle, but when you're on twisty roads and in a tight corner, slamming the gas pedal in a low gear will most certainly send you off the road."
Nissan,33obnv,quick_beige_fox,1 point,Fri Apr 24 14:04:18 2015 UTC,This sounds very interesting. I consider myself a fairly good driver and also took a couple of security and drift lessons.

Nissan,33n9aq,knammer,5,Thu Apr 23 22:17:05 2015 UTC,"Personally if I were you I wouldn't mod this car just because its so new, and if you make a mistake its going to be quite costly. If you really want to do affordable mods why not pick up a cheap car, then it doesnt matter if you mess up too bad.  If you are stuck on modding this one though, make sure to keep us updated with how it goes :P"
Nissan,33n9aq,ayoyo227,5,Fri Apr 24 00:11:07 2015 UTC,"I agree with you for sure but he could also do relatively simple things like wheels, coilovers (sometimes pretty affordable and not all too hard to instal) some sway bars or strut bars. Basically stiffen up the car so that it feels more responsive."
Nissan,33n9aq,knammer,2,Fri Apr 24 00:24:24 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, for sure! I was thinking more technical performance type mods. Suspension stuff is pretty simple and does really improve the feel, definitely a good mod to start with."
Nissan,33n9aq,ayoyo227,-1,Fri Apr 24 00:34:37 2015 UTC,I get what you meant though. I waited until I worked at Mini's shop over the summer until I did serious mods on my car.   (I don't personally own a nissan so I'm sorry dear subreddit. But my dad has an R35 GTR if that solves your hatred towards me at least a little.)
Nissan,33n9aq,Gingervitis526,2,Fri Apr 24 01:10:24 2015 UTC,Its an 8 year old car though. I suppose age is relative but I wouldn't let that stop me. Especially because it is completely out of warranty.

Nissan,33n9aq,Corona887,4,Tue Apr 28 20:25:42 2015 UTC,"The best affordable mod to do is the one behind the steering wheel. Seriously. Get some AutoX time and since you want to do rally, RallyX time. It's a boat load of fun and you really learn how to drive your car and the limitations.  Wouldn't really recommend RallyX until you have some seat-time doing something that's not as harsh on the car."
Nissan,33n9aq,Corona887,2,Fri Apr 24 00:56:15 2015 UTC,"Same position but with a 2008. So far, I found the most effective mods hp wise were headers, 02 sensor and ecu management. This car already has an upgraded qr25 engine, pistons, intake and piping. So I wouldn't really mess with those. This also depends if you want to rally, stance, or drag."
Nissan,33n9aq,TwinTurboSkyline,2,Thu Apr 23 23:03:13 2015 UTC,"Ok. First car. That means your ~16-17 years old in the ""Boy Racer"" period of your life (which hopefully you will never grow out of ;)).   For impressing the girls and such, you'll want to lower it with quality springs or coilovers. At least 2"". Next, you need to be loud. Get a catback exhaust - a reputable brand and not just a 4"" cannon so you actually get some power out of it. Obviously you need a cold air intake. Make sure it's not a short ram intake that sucks up hot air from in the engine bay.  Obviously wheels and tires (lightweight is better) reducing unsprung weight and rotational mass is just like adding horsepower. Weight reduction, bro. Get rid of that spare tire and shit. 100lbs lost = roughly 10whp gained, even more when it's unsprung weight.  The above things are kind of ""price of entry"" mods to get into the scene. If you want to have a rally car flavour, put some Rally Armour mudguards on and call it a day."
Nissan,33n9aq,Shinj0,1 point,Fri Apr 24 11:37:10 2015 UTC,"Don't plan to lol. As for lowering the car, I can do that but again I kinda want to go for a rallyx kinda look, not to mention I'll be living up in northern Canada for 2 years for trades school so can't go to low. As for te exhaust what do u suggest? I've looked at stillen and borla but abit pricy. Some of my friends mentioned a small exhaust shop near me that can do a whole cat back system for around 200. Don't know if it's a good idea but a lot of the dealers and garages around the area highly recommend it."
Nissan,33n9aq,the_real_dgfresh,1 point,Mon Apr 27 22:47:19 2015 UTC,"I would go with a bigger name brand, just because of the R&D behind their product. A shop can make you a nice looking exhaust that fits well, but they won't pay as much attention to the dynamics and fine tuning for more power.   Even if you don't want to be low, your stock springs are going to be soft and lack response compared to even a mild drop with good springs. I'm sure tein or eibach would make a 1-1.5"" drop spring that would really firm it up.   Where in Northern Canada are you? I'm in NS, roads are terrible, but I had a slammed civic and now a lowered Supra. As long as you're careful you won't have any issues."

There are quite a few here. for a GTT you are looking at around 25k landed and titled as for a GTR you're looking at 65k+ landed and titled."

There are very few that were imported prior to when that law was passed.  If you happen to find one of those for sale, it won't be cheap.  Think GT-R prices.  (This is assuming you live in the US).  1990 and older R32s are legal.  They may not look the same, but they make the same glorious noise.

Nissan,33oq34,gekkointraining,2,Fri Apr 24 15:22:41 2015 UTC,"Not totally relevant to the question, but I don't think there was an R34 in the first Fast and Furios. He drove an Eclipse until he totaled it in the first race with Dom, and the car he built once he was part of the crew was a 2JZ Supra. The first R34 doesn't make an appearance until 2 Fast 2 Furious, which was the silver with blue stripes. Then one is seen in Tokyo Drift when Han and Sean are driving on the freeway. The Bayside Blue R34 doesn't show up until the fourth film. After that its only R35s making appearances.     In regards to how much a dream R34 can run? The sky is the limit. If you can even manage to get one into the US, you're likely looking to spend around $40-$50k after importing costs. Then, I personally can imagine dumping another $40-$50k into it in customization - but everyone is different.     Edit: You can get a ""show and display"" exemption to legally import an R34 into the US, but you're only allowed to put 2,500 miles on it per year."

Don't worry about buying new bushings and the new suspension parts you buy later come with them or not because once you install the bushings, it's pretty much impossible to remove them without damaging them. You cannot reuse them.  Bushings need to be oiled when they go in because it's a press fit. It'll be very hard to install them without lube. You do not need to lube them as a maintenance thing.  If you're going to replace suspension parts, buy the part and the bushings all in one go. It'll be easier for you to install the bushings all while still having a running car as you may need a press to get the old bushing out and new one in. There are ways to do it without needing a press though that involves fire and fat people."

We nissan techs have the ability to pull data from the vdr, but no way to access said data. Launch control is tame these days, I would be more concerned with the overall vehicle condition (brakes and tires, oil changes, regular service) rather than how many times someone launched it. If someone had the money to service it, they likely took care of it as well. My 2 cents."

Nissan,33j8o2,cutbackdropturn,1 point,Thu Apr 23 02:26:04 2015 UTC,If you launch too much your gonna be changing trans fluid with the your oil changes. And that is some expensive fluid.

I own a 2012 (bought used) and would be happy to answer any questions you have.   Also I tell everyone who's in the market you should be searching for cars '12 and older, they made so many improvements that year it is a better possible car in everyway."
Nissan,33j8o2,Tecz26,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:37:41 2015 UTC,"Haha well I certainly can't afford a brand new GT-R so used is what I will be looking through.   What were the additions to the 12' that made it that much more superior? - All I had been reading was the 2009s were the year to avoid due to the hard factory launch control.   And how much do you enjoy the car? Do you use it as a DD, track car, or both?"
Nissan,33j8o2,Tecz26,2,Thu Apr 23 15:09:19 2015 UTC,"The biggest improvement is they bumped the power up from around 485 to 530, they've bumped it up incrmentialy since and it's now at around 550, but if you go prior to 2012 you are missing out on the biggest increase during the cars lifespan. I believe they did this by juicing up the turbos from around 10 to 13 psi. And it brings the cars claimed 0-60 to 2.9 seconds, down from 3.5.   In addition the dashboard is cleaned up a bit, they changed the color of the guage backlight from an orange/black  to a blue/white color, and added carbon fiber trim around some dash pieces. Both of these I believe makes the interior nicer.   There's also a comfort mode for the suspension (necessary to soften the ride, and a fuel saving mode ( I don't really use this because it takes away too much power) but it's nice to have especially with gas going back up. I don't believe these came on prior cars.   Lastly I hear many things about improvements in the suspension and that the '12s+ have a more robust transmission, as evidenced by the doubling of the service interv al for the transmission (36k instead of 18k).   Overall it's a great car. I DD mine and sometimes drive my friends kid in it with a car seat so practically isnt all that bad for a car with this level of performance, although I don't track it, I have a sport bike for that. Cost isn't that bad besides what I've mentioned before and it really isn't bad on gas,  although it's not fun to explain to your girlfriend why one nail in your tire costs more then she spent servicing her car all of last year.   Good luck man."

Nissan,33fidg,Fissue,1 point,Wed Apr 22 03:29:47 2015 UTC,Personally I would go for the accord purely because of remaining factory warranty which I think has expired on the Nissan.

Nissan,33fidg,gekkointraining,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:00:18 2015 UTC,"09 was the first model year for the 7th gens, and there were a few kinks that Nissan had to work out at first - but maybe this car has already had the work done (any chance you can see the maintenance history?). The fact that its six years old and only has ~30k miles on it corroborates the spotless statements, and may bode well for the longevity of it in your hands.      In terms of maintenance, Japanese cars are pretty comparable - costs will be the same for Nissan/Honda/Toyota (although a newer Accord may still have the factory warranty - the Maxima you're looking at may only have a short duration dealer warranty).      From a personal standpoint I'd have an independent mechanic take a look at it just to be sure it's in good working order. As a Nissan fan and a Maxima owner (have a 5th gen, but have been eyeing the 7th gens for awhile - may trade in my Altima and grab a 2015 Maxima once they're discounted to make way for the 8th gen 2016s), I would take the Maxima over a Honda, especially an Accord, any day. But to each their own."

Nissan,33ftro,r0ninar1es,1 point,Wed Apr 22 04:16:50 2015 UTC,"First lets start from the vehicles background. The pathfinder has an amazing interior, the engine is shared with the murano and maxima, and can seat 7 pretty good. The 3.5 liter engine is powerful but it's mated to a CVT but that shouldn't be a turnoff to you because Nissan makes pretty good CVT's. My mom has a 09 Murano and it's shifts good except you don't hear it shifting from one gear to another. I don't know your budget but if you can pay for the SL trim or Platinum, the infotainment system comes with around view monitoring so it can be pretty helpful to see the surroundings of the car. As for the Xterra, the truck is basically 10 years old, has the same 5 speed auto and 6 speed manual, this is the last year for the Xterra so get one sooner than later, but even though its old it has a lot of power. If you plan on going offtoading or just through trails, consider the PRO-4X trim. I driven my dads 05 frontier which has the same 4.0 engine as the Xterra, and that truck will go when you want it to go. Never loses power even after 10 years but you have to properly maintain it. I think the groundbreaking question for you is what are you going to do with it? If you are planning to go offroading on the trails, put some stuff in the trunk that you don't mind it being dirty, then the Xterra is your pick. If you are going to be on pavement most of the time, want to seat at most 7 people comfortably, be able to tow 5000 pounds with ease, then go for the Pathfinder. I'm not sure the Xterra's tow rating but I remember for my dad's Frontier it was 6500 pounds so it should be somewhat near for the Xterra. Hope this helps."
Nissan,33ftro,PRO4X,2,Wed Apr 22 05:28:13 2015 UTC,I did not know the Xterra was headed the way of the dodo but thats good to know. Why buy sooner than later or what are some of the cons of buying a vehicle no longer available?  This help a lot. Thank you.
Nissan,33ftro,PRO4X,1 point,Wed Apr 22 06:45:14 2015 UTC,"The only reason I said to buy sooner than later is because if you want the Xterra brand new, get it before they stop building it by the end of this year. There is nothing wrong with buying a vehicle that is no longer available, your warranty for the vehicle will be there. I don't know which car you are leaning towards but I would go test drive both of them and see which vehicle appeals to you more."
Nissan,33ftro,gekkointraining,2,Wed Apr 22 14:31:50 2015 UTC,"Has Nissan actually made a formal announcement regarding the discontinuation of the Xterra? All I've seen so far is ""he-said, she-said"" articles - the same kind of articles that have said the Xterra will be cancelled after model year XXXX for the last four years...     Regarding OP's question, we would probably need some more info to really point you in the right direction. That being said, I actively hate the way the new Pathfinder looks (Nissan has two and half crossovers already in the Murano, Rogue/Rogue Select - why did they have to ruin a good SUV?) and couldn't in good faith tell you to get it on styling alone, but to each their own."
Nissan,33ftro,PRO4X,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:37:33 2015 UTC,"A friend told me the Xterra is being discontinued and I googled it and on Edmunds.com and on other sites like Autoblog.com also confirmed the Xterra's discontinuation. Most likely the reason it's being discontinued is because of poor sales and that reason is quite obvious because they haven't updated it since 2005. The only vehicle that competes with the Xterra is the wrangler, and now there is no competition for the Wrangler.  As with /u/gekkointraining , OP please include some info about what you want to do with the vehicle so we can point you towards the right direction."

Nissan,339pua,thethorinium,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:11:39 2015 UTC,Your gonna have to pay a lot for customs and transit. (Jap to bc then truck drive to toronto) also for owning an r33 can be pricey. Parts are a lot not just because its jdm. But also a gtr tax. Also just remember you are buying a 15 year or older car. So its pretty much always going to need some thing.
Nissan,336l01,vrmogul,7,Mon Apr 20 00:49:23 2015 UTC,"So much misinformation going on here and elsewhere it hurts. This is Canada all over again, and I was there in 2004 when it all began. From 2004-2008 I imported over 80 cars, most of them being Skylines and Fairlady Zs. I now live in the US and import as a hobby and this is seriously deja-vu for me. I am bored in my hotel so here is some education:  There are basically two ways you will see JDM cars being sold in the US market 1) Brokerage - where an importer helps a client source a car in Japan via auction or private dealer to buy it sight unseen 2) Landed Stock in the US - Just like a used car dealership.  So when you guys are talking about a car being overpriced, or underpriced, or whatever, you need to consider how it is being purchased. Obviously, since brokerage puts all the risk on the client and not the importer, it is going to be cheaper. If you are buying a landed US JDM car you are going to pay more due to the fact that the importer took the risk (and yes there is substantial risk involved), the car is physically present for you to inspect, the importer should have put in a bunch of money for general maintenance and to fix issues with the car after they land, shipping and registration fees, loss of income due to investment tie up etc. It adds up fast, very fast.  Now for pricing. It really depends on the car you are trying to import and when you buy it. You are going to pay quite a bit more for a vehicle that is nearing the 25 year mark especially if it is in demand like the Skyline is (Both the GTR and GTS-T). If you try and buy a car that is 5-6 months out from being legal you won't have as much competition at auction and should be able to snag it at a considerably lower price. Keep in mind that you now need to pay a monthly fee to have it stored in Japan until it is legal for import into the US. So you have to do your calculations to see if it is worth it for you to do this. You have to set a budget and work with that budget if you want to come out ahead.  The US market is a bit interesting. The law says the car has to be at least 25 years old to be legal for import. As you can imagine, 25 year old cars such as the Skyline are getting very difficult to find in Japan in good condition. Many cars have been in accidents and repaired poorly, beaten up and raced, rusted out etc. We are now fighting for what's left in Japan after Canada, Aus, Europe etc have all scooped up the good stuff. The cars in ""good"" condition are getting more and more rare and the prices only keep going up as the competition also goes up.  One only needs to look at the auction sold history to see what a “good” condition GTR is going for in recent months. You will understand why I put the word “good” in quotations later on. A non accident GTR, with a straight body, decent paint, ok interior and some bolt on modifications will be going for between 1,200,000 - 1,420,000 Yen car cost. At today’s exchange rate that is ~$10,100 - $12,000. Now, take that car cost number and add all the fees to export, import, ship, register etc and you start to get a pretty expensive 25 year old car purchased sight unseen.  Here is an accurate calculation of a Skyline GTR that could cost 1,250,000 at auction at todays exchange rate:  Car Cost $10,536.25 Car Cost at Auction (varies on exchange rate) Shipping $1,306.50 RORO Fee (varies on car size) Export Fee $885.05 Exporter Fee (can vary) Funds Transfer Fee $75.00 Wire Transfer and Exchange Rate Fee Customs Broker Fee $450.00 Customs Broker Fee Customs Duty $263.41 Import Duty 1 Harbor Fee $13.17 Import Duty 2 Merch Proc Fee $36.50 Import Duty 3 Handling Fee $210.00 Steam Line Fee (can vary) US Transport Fee $600.00 Transport from CA to your state (will vary depending on where you live) Reg and Tax Fee $580 (will vary depending on where you live)  If you are having the car brokered for you add another ~$2000 on top for their work. The fee will vary from importer to importer.   Total Investment done yourself $14,955.86 or ~$16,955.96 if paying a local import broker.   We are nearly at 15K imported yourself or ~17K through a broker, all before any amount of maintenance or repairs. Now I will explain “good” condition to you. The truth is that no matter how amazing a car looks at auction, or at a dealer, there is almost always maintenance and repairs that need to be done for it to be safe or run properly once it lands in the US. Cross your fingers that it only needs fluids, spark plugs, rotors and pads, maybe some tires. Skylines are not the most reliable cars and have a lot of common problems that are not that cheap or easy to fix. Finding replacement parts is also not easy nor is it cheap. Many cars need their timing belts replaced, coil packs or ignitors replaced, vacuum leaks fixed, turbos replaced etc. Sometimes you get a car with a bad and grinding transmission, other times you get one that has an engine that burns oil or has low compression and needs to be rebuilt. You need to realize that these are 25 year old cars and no matter what the mileage says, you will have to be prepared to fix 25 year old failing parts.   A decent and honest importer will bring in a car for their local stock and bring it up to spec maintenance wise so that the new owner doesn’t have to worry about these things, at least not for awhile anyways. Of course this adds to the bottom line investment.  If you are the risky type, go get a car brokered for you by an importer. Otherwise find one that has been landed here in the US, go inspect it for yourself and sleep easy knowing exactly what you paid for.   TLDR; Risky type? Pay less. Play it Safe type? Pay more. End of story: there are many variables involved here that you guys need to just stop saying “Oh you paid too much”. What someone paid depends on so many factors. Also, who cares? Buy a car, enjoy it, a couple grand here or there is not going to change your life in any way. Just go have some fun."
Nissan,336l01,config__t,1 point,Mon Apr 20 08:14:52 2015 UTC,Agreed. And the bit at the end of the article about military benefits is somewhat false. You would purchase your car same way anybody else would in Japan and pay whatever the car costs. When you PCS (Permanent Change of Station) you need to have the entitlement to have a POV (Privately Owned Vehicle) shipped with your HHG (Household Goods). Yes the shipping of the vehicle will be on the government's dime but the paperwork going through customs is all on you.
Nissan,336l01,raybrant,1 point,Tue Apr 21 01:37:53 2015 UTC,"So not to be a jerk, but that's exactly what the article says.  It says you buy the vehicle (hopefully at a good price) and you must have the option of shipping a POV.  And as someone who has shipped vehicles from Korea, the paperwork isn't all you.  You basically take it to a VPC (vehicle processing center) get it inspected and sign a couple of documents.  When you get stateside you pick it up at a nearby VPC and sign for it and the custom docs come with it.  This was me just months ago."
Nissan,336l01,raybrant,1 point,Tue Apr 21 02:29:55 2015 UTC,"Having done it personally, can you expand on what you did exactly? I'm under the impression that the car has to conform, if it's over 25+ yrs it'll have to have accompanying EPA and NHTSA documents for exemption and be deregistered in it's home country. Maybe you can shed some light on it."
Nissan,336l01,lew2077,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:01:40 2015 UTC,"In my case, I just shipped a US spec car to Korea (a Toyota) and then shipped it back.  It was fairly simple.  I actually bought my Skyline stateside and it came with the shipping documents - you must have those or it's not legal!  As for specifically shipping a Skyline back from Japan, I recently talk to a guy who shipped an '89 GTR back with no issues whatsoever.  Like you said - you must de-register the car off base and on base and this is every vehicle. I had to register my US-spec car twice - once for the Korean government and then on the base.  And then like any other car you take it to a processing center and after it's inspected to make sure it's in compliance (it must be clean and you cant leave stuff in the car besides a small box in the trunk) and notes are taken about it's current condition, you sign a couple of documents and you're pretty much done at that point.  The company handles all the customs forms and exemptions.  I'll tell you right now that they know what they're doing - if the car can't be shipped, it would be turned away and the owner contacted.  Note that I have heard of members trying to ship Skylines in the past and being turned away.  When you get stateside, you usually get called after a month, hopefully, and told where to pick up your car.  When you go to pick it up you'll give it an inspection to make sure there is no additional damage and sign for it.  You then get the shipping/customs docs.  When you go to register it you must present your de-registration certificate us spec or not, title, etc.    Unless something changes or the company is doing it the wrong way - there won't be anything different regardless of what you are shipping as long as it falls under what can be legally shipped.  The ironic thing about it is that we generally cannot bring our US vehicles to Japan so you are 'forced' to purchase a Japanese vehicle.  And then it gets a hardcore inspection called a JCI - it's a big pain."
Nissan,336l01,Downhill280Z,2,Tue Apr 21 21:17:56 2015 UTC,"Simply put it's a shit situation whereby USA buyers are on the wrong end of a highly inflated supply/demand situation.  You're paying 2 to 3 times for for a vehicle than anyone else by virtue of the 25 year rule only qualifying the 89 and 90 year models.  You just have to pony up the extra money and yes ultimately, you are massively overpaying to buy a HCR32 for 15K but there is no other way."
Nissan,336l01,raybrant,4,Mon Apr 20 04:09:19 2015 UTC,Meh. Not entirely accurate. Limited research was put in to this and the prices noted are about 3-5k higher than anything I've seen in my extensive search.

You will be surprised what auction inspectors miss, omit, misrepresent, or grade incorrectly/inconsistently on a regular basis. It isn't a science, they aren't mechanics. This is a high level visual inspection for the most part. Auction reports are not the best way to know about your car; having your contact in Japan inspect it for you prior to it going through the auction is. If you don't have this luxury then the only other option is the auction sheet. If that is the case you should look through the history and see if the car has been through auction before and compare auction sheets. Should also have someone you trust translate the user and inspectors notes (although the inspectors notes are usually pretty brief and seem to be very similar between cars).  Disclaimer: Not trying to start a fight, just want to spread long term experience based information only."

Nissan,336l01,config__t,1 point,Mon Apr 20 16:53:29 2015 UTC,"Sure. The way that most Skylines are purchased are through Japanese auction houses. Not private sellers. These auction houses often ship far and wide, including to the US. While I'm not willing to divulge my source, it's something you can find easily on google under ""Import Japanese Cars"" and it ends in .org - They have GTS-T Type M's, GTS-T's, and even GTR's of the R32 variant anywhere from 3k to 25k. Depends on what you want. But a high (80k) mile GT-R R32 in reasonable condition can be had anywhere from 9-13k. Not this silly 25-30k that ""SkylineMan"" or whatever stipulates.   Now, that's the base cost of the car. You need to calculate another 1 -1.5k for shipping and bringing it home from port. I'm in the middle of the US, and my closest FOB shipping (no crate required, ""free on board"" boat shipping) is Miami, FL. So, I pay 800$ ish to get it to Miami, and then another ~400 in gas and lodgings to get get it home."
Nissan,336l01,frostymoose,1 point,Mon Apr 20 04:09:19 2015 UTC,"I think you mean to say RORO shipping. While the FOB term is used only with non containerized shipping, it actually refers to payment terms rather than the type of shipping you are trying to explain."
Nissan,336l01,MrOwnageQc,1 point,Mon Apr 20 08:43:00 2015 UTC,"OK, so I didn't find anything easily under ""Import Japanese Cars"" as you said.  At least not anything at the prices you're claiming.  With that being said, I don't think you are BSing, but I'm telling you that most people in the US won't be purchasing a GTR in good condition at 13K.  They'll be lucky to get a GTS-T for that price.  And just looking around, for some reason it looks like prices may have gone up a little more or Skyline are getting more scarce.  Simply telling people that they'll  actually be able to easily find a Skyline at your prices is misinformation in my opinion and yes, you better be ready to cough up at least 20K for a 'reasonable' GTR.   Anyways, it seems like you have imported a GTR before using your 'source'.   What was the total price you paid (if you dont mind divulging) to get it to your driveway?"

Usually takes 2-3 days to come in.  one last thing you can try is finding a dealer that sells them and see if they have a parts car.  What part of Japan are you visiting?

Nissan,32z2gp,FunkMetal804,1 point,Sat Apr 18 01:59:37 2015 UTC,Powertrain covers engine and transmission. Id go with the 14 if it has warranty though. The warranties should be 3yr/36000 bumper to bumper and a 5yr/60000 mile engine and powertrain. Man it sounds like a great deal just dont be afraid to ask questions
Nissan,32z2gp,FunkMetal804,2,Sat Apr 18 02:41:00 2015 UTC,"The '13 was a rental vehicle and the '14 was a personal lease vehicle, for what it's worth."
Nissan,32yswd,Cancer-Cheater,1 point,Fri Apr 17 21:06:08 2015 UTC,Probably because the 3.5 option was dropped starting in 2013 for the coupe.
Nissan,32yswd,BluAnimal,1 point,Fri Apr 17 21:53:04 2015 UTC,"You're better off spreading out on tracking down a 2008 - 2012 model, where the 3.5 SE/SR is available.  Although, based on your model year selection, you may prefer the 2010-2013 refresh.  But yeah, Nissan barely made the 3.5 coupe with a 6-speed manual. The most common ones are the 2.5 S CVT, and the less common, but more relatively common 3.5 SE/SR CVT."

Nissan,32yswd,BigBuffalo757,1 point,Fri Apr 17 22:47:37 2015 UTC,You could alway get a bluetooth hook up for the AUX (which will also allow you to play music wirelessly) and I think they can add the factory backup camera if you really want it. Not sure if the other trims still have:  -Bose  -Leather  -Heated Seats
Nissan,32yswd,BigBuffalo757,1 point,Sat Apr 18 00:47:57 2015 UTC,They are rare AF my friend. Not only did they stop making the 3.5 but so few 6 speeds were made. Nevermind finding one fully loaded. Just have to constantly look and hope and pray the Nissan Gods bless you.   Edit: Saw your post on r/cars. The AC should be well under your budget and meets all of your requirements. A few bolt ons/upgrades (Rear sway bar + links/ exhaust/ y-pipe/ intake/ suspension) will make driving even more fun. The SR trim with leather and tech packages do give the car a premium feel. No one on the forums (Nicoclub) has complained about reliability issues.  Drive the 95 miles to go get her. You'll love her.
Nissan,32vp5i,xanderdeg,4,Fri Apr 17 02:33:23 2015 UTC,how does one just assume they would never enjoy owning a vehicle. that makes no sense to me lol.

Nissan,32vp5i,RouseHouse1013,-2,Fri Apr 17 12:24:43 2015 UTC,I wouldnt enjoy owning a GTR. Too many driving aids and an automatic transmission. Cars Ive driven with that kind of stuff are like playing a video game with all the aids. It may be fast and fun for a while but you are very removed from actually driving it.
Nissan,32vp5i,deerhurst,3,Fri Apr 17 12:53:22 2015 UTC,"There is more to the driving experience than shifting. I liked driving way before I got my first stick (started on an Altima, of all things). The GTR can really knock you into your seat like none other. As far as I know, you can turn just about every assist off on the GTR, if you don't want them.  I think the only reason I can see someone really not enjoying the GTR is the price tag."

Nissan,32vp5i,simplexxityy,0,Fri Apr 17 23:56:26 2015 UTC,I'd love to but I would never own one. I've drive a good number of sports cars though nothing like a GTR. All of them with autos have felt dull. I have more fun driving my 30 year old manual truck than an audi a6 or a8.

Nissan,32vuxt,tensop,2,Fri Apr 17 22:11:02 2015 UTC,"So far JDM Import Ltd. has been very responsive to inquiries. Looks like a GT-T will run you between 10-15k, and a GT-R over 30-35k. Looks like they have more-or-less about a $1800-2000 fee on top of various Japan and Canada taxes.  Velocity Cars seems to have a lot of stock but I haven't tried to contact them or anything  I'm also looking at ""going to the source"" and using Brave Auto International. They're Japan based, and do everything there. You basically would have to deal with customs and inspections once the car makes it to Canada. I'm not sure how much can be saved this way, especially if you don't know exactly what you'd need to do (such as someone like me)  It'd be nice if there were some reviews out there with some comparisons and horror stories"

I only knew it was oil system related due to the oil pressure gauge would fluctuate with the sound. Overall, she has been an expensive, but well worth it car.

Nissan,326a72,Colored_Infinity,2,Sat Apr 11 01:45:13 2015 UTC,Ikey or standard key?
Nissan,326a72,Colored_Infinity,1 point,Sat Apr 11 04:57:10 2015 UTC,Intelligent key.
Nissan,326a72,Colored_Infinity,2,Sat Apr 11 10:52:21 2015 UTC,If i remember correctly the ikey uses rfid and is passive. The car should start even if the battery in the fob is dead.   It's been a few years so i may be wrong. Try changing the battery
Nissan,326a72,Colored_Infinity,1 point,Sat Apr 11 14:38:13 2015 UTC,"Ok. So that the rfid is passive, good. I changed the battery and nothing happens. Do I need to reprogram it? If so, how is that done? Thank you!"
Nissan,326a72,xoomerfy,1 point,Sat Apr 11 15:20:29 2015 UTC,Either a reprogram or replacement if the battery change doesn't work.   To do that you're stuck with going to the dealer unfortunately.
Nissan,326wsn,punaniXpert69,2,Sat Apr 11 02:32:34 2015 UTC,"Okay so if your car comes with the ""Driver Preferred Package"", which is an optional trim on the SE model, you already have HIDs. I am assuming that is your situation since you said it has stock ballasts. So why did you buy an HID kit?"
Nissan,326wsn,morejosh,1 point,Sat Apr 11 02:39:50 2015 UTC,i have a 3.5SL
Nissan,326wsn,Colored_Infinity,1 point,Sat Apr 11 02:41:35 2015 UTC,Xenon is a gas.  HID kits use xenon bulbs.  If you have factory xenon you have HID headlights already.   But to answer your question you would bypass the factory ballast and install an aftermarket kit. I don't suggest that.   For the fogs it's just pop the bulb and aftermarket ballast in.

Programming ranges from $60-110ish, while the I-key is two separate purchases, the mechanical key top half, and the remote/intelligent key bottom half.

Nissan,320x3f,xoomerfy,2,Fri Apr 10 13:03:36 2015 UTC,Service advisor said that they must have recorded the miles when I went in with the initial issue and I should not have been allowed to leave with the car and given a loaner in the mean time until the part came in.

Nissan,31vldl,mikefitzvw,1 point,Wed Apr 8 14:58:23 2015 UTC,"Maybe they changed it themselves in the summer, and at a shop in the winter.    Take the valve cover off and look for signs of abuse (sludge, etc).  It should be nice and clean under there."
Nissan,31vldl,Beast66,5,Wed Apr 8 18:42:16 2015 UTC,"Depends on if they used regular or synthetic but even with synthetic that's a long time between oil changes.

Nissan,31vldl,Beast66,1 point,Wed Apr 8 14:38:38 2015 UTC,But lets say this car is cheaper than other cars I was looking at. I am going to bring it to a mechanic for them to check it out in depth but would you say it can be corrected and restored in a way? Or should I not even bother.   Edit: and it was a leased car.

I think that I'd pass on buying a used V-6. Granted, the fuel mileage of the 4-cyl of the same generation car isn't THAT much better.  But to the point:  Oil changes only every 12-14k certainly seems like a long span.  Does this car have an on-board computer that tells the driver when to change the oil?  I'm betting it's new enough that it does; and that the owner's manual states that you only need to change the oil when the car's computer tells you to."

Nissan,31tjzi,spacecasedilla,1 point,Wed Apr 8 01:22:33 2015 UTC,To go from N up to R or P you have to both have the brake pedal depressed and push in the shifter button.   So I'm guessing whatever mechanism connects your brake pedal to the shifter is dislocated and not doing its thing.
Nissan,31tjzi,baconfase,1 point,Fri Apr 10 23:32:58 2015 UTC,"The key won't release because it's not in park. The shift lock bypass button should always free it up. Are you sure you're pressing it in deep enough? Press until it bottoms out or the shifter moves into park.   Two things might cause this. either your brake pedal sensor is broken and not telling the car that your foot is on the brake (check if brake lights go on). Or the relay that is triggered when your foot is on the brake doesn't work anymore. You should be able to hear two clicks when the key is turned on and you press your foot on the brake, one click for the relay activating and another click for the shift lock disengaging. They should happen at the same time but shift lock is usually louder, if you can hear the relay at all.   The if your shifter has a thumb button, that could also be the issue, but it's pretty rare for those to suddenly stop working."

Nissan,31qnue,FunkMetal804,1 point,Tue Apr 7 12:19:53 2015 UTC,"You can't go wrong with either one, but if you really like sportier styling and handling, then you have to go for the Mazda 6. I own one and while I like Nissan a lot, the Mazda 6 is a pretty amazing car. If you could get the 2016 Mazda 6, that would be the best choice.   It's a comfortable ride, but their is a bit of road noise. It's a well refined car. Requires synthetic oil, has nitrogen filled tires and a lot of other cool technology. The interior quality is great, although the infotainment could be a lot better, but they've supposedly fixed it on the 2016 model. I've enjoyed my experience so far.   Edit: also, I find that the 4cylinder engine packs plenty of power. Unfortunately, it does not have a V6 option."

But if I get what you're talking about go to an Auto Zone/ Advanced Auto/ or whatever you have in the Great White North and ask for:  -Body panel clips -Body trim clips -Nylon clips   They should have a stand with a bunch of them.
Nissan,31rdob,BigBuffalo757,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:21:19 2015 UTC,"Is 'Auto Zone' a shop? I'm okay with ordering online, I just need to know where I can buy these online?   My understanding is that there wouldn't be a stand though, the Juke isn't too popular here and I don't know that this connector for the cargo cover is universal across vehicles.... =/  I can't send pics, because I lost the one piece that fell out, and the other piece that's still in there isn't visible when it's in properly. .....and I'll probably break it if I pull it out.

I dont know what size you'll need for the Juke though. I normally go to the shop and guess and check. It may not match the other once installed. I not sure Nissan sells the OEM ones.

Nissan,31oqc0,mikefitzvw,1 point,Mon Apr 6 23:30:05 2015 UTC,"Nissan should care - they've known about this far longer than 2015.    I have a '97 Sentra which never rusted nearly this bad.    My friend's 02 Altima, however, had this exact problem.  In fucking 2009.  The dealer likewise told them to pound sand, despite the car being only 7 years old, and obviously having damage far earlier than that (friend and I both got our cars in 2009 in High School).  What's ironic is that my car has 1/10th the amount of rustproofing the 2002 had, yet this one spot happens to be a severe issue.  It's clearly a severe design flaw.    I think it's safe to say that they're just going to let this one go - if they weren't gonna fix it a few years after the cars went out of production, they certainly aren't going to do it now.  My friend was very lucky that the inspection shop didn't catch it (which was their primary job - inspecting the dang car) so his dad got them to pay for the entire repair, to the tune of $2000 (on a $6000 car).    It's a shame too - that car, with the rust issues, a rear subframe issue I forget, numerous CEL's due to the crankshaft position sensor other engine-related mishaps, and a horrid dealer experience turned his whole family off from Nissan forever.    And here I am still driving my lil Sentra, being mindful of body integrity but otherwise fine."

I know of two in the United States that people have had great experience with. I would try giving them a call or email to see if they can import a car for you, or if they can find a reputable RI in Canada/Vancouver.   I'm just kind of assuming this but I think most RI's figure out the kind of car you want and look for it within the specifications (price, grade, mileage, etc) you give them. I think it takes up too much time if they send you information on every car they come in contact with to see if you're interested.   However there are some sites where you can look at cars that will be auctioned off soon. If you find one you like, give a reputable RI a call and I'm sure they can figure out a way to inspect it and bid on it for you.   Here's a list of resources:  Rivsu Imports (Florida RI)- http://www.rivsuimports.com/  International Vehicle Importers (California RI)- http://www.importavehicle.com/  Potential Auction Houses-  Goo-Net- http://www.goo-net-exchange.com/usedcars/  Japan-Partner- http://www.japan-partner.com/  Edit: Don't forget to the check out the link on the side bar regarding importation to the U.S. There is some good information even for those located in Canada."

I'd wait at least 2-3 years to see if any problems pop up before buying a new model.

I have a 2 door, and the turn radius is not great, but I haven't had any trouble navigating Chicago with it, so his complaint there doesn't seem too valid.  Definitely agree with his other 2 complaints there.  All in all I'm very happy with my purchase, and feel like I got a truck that is just as good as the Tacoma at a reduced price.  Plus, with the new model coming out next year dealerships are very eager to get rid of the 2015s.  Leaves a ton of room to bargain.  Loved both the Canyon and the Colorado, but they're massive and living in Chicago I did not want to deal with having to park one of those beasts on the street everyday.

Nissan,31ddi4,Darkmatchfan,2,Sat Apr 4 00:24:50 2015 UTC,Juke Nismo RS AWD owner here.  I mostly keep it in normal mode driving around town.  Sport mode is a bit more zippy and responsive for when I want to really feel the acceleration coming out of turns and such.  Eco mode is really only for stop and go traffic and it really deadens the throttle response. The sport shifting is pretty useless I find.  The preset points are so close together that it feels no different than keeping it in D.  I've only used it to downshift on steep grades.

Is that something you can speak to, Exolis, or do you not really dabble with the Infiniti side of things?"
Nissan,31813x,ThatGuyGetsIt,4,Thu Apr 2 21:40:51 2015 UTC,"I don't do marketability type engineering. So this is just how I see it. The Maxima is basically a sports sedan and Q50 is more luxury. The pricing seems pretty similar to 7th gen with the exception of Platinum grade being added to the line.   I haven't driven the Q50, so I can't really compare how it handles and such. I don't feel like they tried to make it a Luxury car, but more so Premium type grade over the Altima. Now comparing V6 Altima and 7th Gen Maxima to 8th Gen, even with the HP being close, the performance is vastly different.   Other then that, I would say give it a test drive when it comes to Dealers and see how you like it. I basically see it as a 4 Door sports car that will appeal to fans of something like the Altima Coupe and Premium/Sporty feel of Maxima.   What do you mean by Flagship Sedan?"
Nissan,31813x,Exolis87,2,Thu Apr 2 22:26:15 2015 UTC,"Did you just defend the CVT? The Nissan CVT is widely regarded as one of the worst additions to a car. I think for the sake of all of us, you need to stop sipping the obvious Kool Aide. We all want the new Maxima to work."
Nissan,31813x,RedWhiteAndJew,5,Thu Apr 2 22:55:38 2015 UTC,"If the CVT is widely regarded as a bad thing, why do people keep buying Nissans? I'm sure if it bothered people enough, they would buy something else, right?   Not that I'm defending the CVT, but whatever Jatco did for the Maxima's CVT, they did an amazing job because it doesn't feel like it has a CVT."

Nissan,31813x,so_smog_hog,1 point,Fri Apr 3 02:01:42 2015 UTC,"For the Maxima to be Nissan's flagship sedan it really seems like they're half-assing it. Still sticking with the VQ35 when there are V8s out there in the same price range that are getting better gas mileage while also delivering more power to the wheels.  The interior seems pretty nice.  The exterior seems to be inspired by a mixture of Maxda, Toyota, Ford, and Kia....but in this day and age I suppose the same can be said of any brand getting influence from other brands.  I'm just incredibly underwhelmed with this model, especially considering they skipped a model year."
Nissan,31813x,ThatGuyGetsIt,3,Thu Apr 2 19:44:31 2015 UTC,"You forget it's Nissan's flagship, they still have Infiniti. They have to build it just enough were they don't cross that fine border between economy sport sedan to luxury sedan."
Nissan,31813x,RedYourDead,1 point,Thu Apr 2 20:43:41 2015 UTC,"No, I understand that. They're not really making a compelling argument to go with a Maxima instead of, say, a Q50. Not at the price points they've established, anyway. And it doesn't help when the 3.5 Altima ever-so-slightly out performs the Maxima even at 20hp less.  Sure the Maxima has a more refined interior and a smoother ride, but again - at the price points the Maxima is sitting at, there isn't a lot of reason to not make the jump to Infiniti."
Nissan,31813x,ThatGuyGetsIt,1 point,Thu Apr 2 20:50:54 2015 UTC,"On the flip side, they could have easily re-badged the Q50, and ""cheapen"" it a little, and call it a Maxima with less features, but then the argument would have been the same with questioning the point of that, when they could have taken the Altima, make it slightly bigger and more upscale.  It comes down to how they market the cars, and what target demographic they are going for.  But I see the point where you're getting at."

Nissan,313j8k,SchunderDownUnder,7,Thu Apr 2 00:52:01 2015 UTC,It's a lovely 8th Gen Chevrolet Impala
Nissan,313j8k,autowikibot,2,Thu Apr 2 02:00:06 2015 UTC,"Chevrolet Impala:       The Chevrolet Impala is a full-size automobile (upper mid-size from 2000 to 2007 ) which was built by the Chevrolet division of General Motors for model years 1958 to 1985, 1994 to 1996 and 2000 to date. Deriving its name from the South African antelope, Chevrolet's most expensive passenger model through 1965 had become the best-selling automobile in the United States, competing against the Ford Galaxie 500 and the Plymouth Fury when full-size models dominated the market.  The Impala was distinguished for many years by its symmetrical triple taillights. The Caprice was introduced as a top-line Impala Sport Sedan for the 1965 model year becoming a separate series positioned above the Impala in 1966, which, in turn, remained above the Bel Air and Biscayne. The Impala continued as Chevrolet's most popular full-size model through the mid-1980s. Between 1994 and 1996, Impala was revived as a muscular 5.7-liter V8–powered version of the Caprice Classic sedan.  In 2000, the Impala was re-introduced again as a mainstream front-wheel drive Hi-Mid sedan.  As of February 2014, the 2014 Impala ranked number one among Affordable Large Cars in U.S. News & World Report's rankings.  As of 2014, the Impala Limited is sold in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The Impala is sold in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the Middle East.  Ed Cole, Chevrolet's chief engineer in the late 1950s, defined the Impala as a ""prestige car within the reach of the average American citizen.""

The key has a small chip in it, if the programs don't match the car will crank till the battery runs out but never turn over. All that smoke though sounds like fuel is making it into the cylinders."

On the motor mounts, do your motor mounts have wires or not?   You may want to go to a local auto parts store and talk to them. They can probably help a lot more than you think on finding the right parts, then you can go order them from Rock Auto."
Nissan,30z2rl,Zombie_Response_Team,1 point,Thu Apr 2 03:12:35 2015 UTC,"Its very likely your motor mounts are bad, the wires send power to a fluid in the mounts to make them firm. Usually they are soft when idling and shifting into drive to reduce any vibration. I would suggest getting the ones without the wires (meant for the car with a manual transmission) because they are much cheaper and improve performance (yet take away some luxury). It isn't unheard of for those electric mounts to short out and fry the ECU.   As for suspension, buying the whole quick strut assembly is usually a better idea when having work done because it saves a lot of labor compared to changing just the strut."

Hell, even if you already owned the car you could get a heads up of any future issues with it. The extra money for a full detailed inspection is worth it.  I don't know much about z32 prices over there but here, that's too good to be true. Have high hopes but low expectations."
Nissan,30msd6,baalsitch,1 point,Sat Mar 28 22:01:43 2015 UTC,Its a realistic price for a classic that will need some work but no MAJOR work.  It will more than likely need a clutch and the rear diff will more than like need service.  To have that car really ready for the street and done right you could end up putting some more money into it.  I'd budget 6k total for that car including the purchase price.  Still worth it.

Nissan,30adut,Well_thats_cool,2,Thu Mar 26 21:44:35 2015 UTC,I traded in my 2012 frontier for this new 2015 Frontier Desert Runner!   http://i.imgur.com/hl9ZRZB.jpg http://i.imgur.com/AbbtxjU.jpg http://i.imgur.com/Qp2Pukn.jpg http://i.imgur.com/nIidLDA.jpg  The only issue I ran into was switching my aftermarket hitch from the 2012 to the 2015 truck. It was a bit narrow and I could only get 4 of the 6 bolts into the frame. The last 2 bolts were only about an 1/8 inch away from fitting. I thought about trying to drill the holes in the hitch a little bigger to make it fit but I then decided to try and stretch it out instead. I used the jack from the truck and a 2x4.   http://i.imgur.com/KFpAm8n.jpg  It ended up working like a charm and the hitch was installed. Now I can carry my kayak around with the new truck!   http://i.imgur.com/DolrC0e.jpg
Nissan,30adut,TheOneThatMoons,1 point,Wed Mar 25 20:28:15 2015 UTC,Nice. What's the difference between the Desert Runner and regular Frontier? I have an 05 LE as my weekend toy hauler. Good truck! A friend of mine has always driven full sized trucks and borrowed mine. He was impressed with the power from a v6
Nissan,30adut,TheOneThatMoons,1 point,Wed Mar 25 22:46:09 2015 UTC,"The Dessert Runner has nicer wheels, bigger tires, Bilstein off road shocks,  and white gauges. It's kind of like the 2 wheel drive version of the pro 4x. It's a great truck! I really liked my 2012 but the lease was up so I decided to upgrade to the new one."
Nissan,30adut,jonny4774,2,Wed Mar 25 23:17:53 2015 UTC,"TIL I started making my own version of a desert runner. My struts needed replacement a couple years ago so I upgraded to Bilsteins and leveled the truck. I added larger all terrain tires to my stock LE wheels and just recently got rid of that restrictive Y-pipe using a dual-in, single-out Magnaflow. What was the added cost for that option? V6 engine still putting out about 270hp?"

Its not too loud, no drone, doesn't make any sound unless you're pushing on the gas. When you do push on the gas is gives off this deep tone which just outs a grin on your face. If you want a nice sound don't cheap out on parts. Look on YouTube there are a Lotta guys that post vids of your make n model with certain exhausts and pick a sound you like. Some research on consumer reviews should do the trick. Good luck."
Nissan,307s1c,bak20,3,Wed Mar 25 04:20:01 2015 UTC,The stock SER altima 3.5 sounds pretty damn good.  You would probably have to get a catback but there's a few advantages to spending the extra cash.    With a catback You won't have to get anything welded. It bolts right up.  They're also usually made from 204 stainless steel so you won't have to worry about it rusting out.    Search Craigslist or find a nissan forum and you'll probably find one for cheap :)

Nissan,307g3m,BraveNewDay,2,Wed Mar 25 03:27:27 2015 UTC,Thanks for the responses. Called the dealer and they suspected the gas cap. Told me to drive it 50-75 miles. If it doesn't clear then bring it in Friday
Nissan,307g3m,LandlockedPirate,2,Wed Mar 25 11:43:40 2015 UTC,"Wow, while they're probably right, You'd think if they had any sense of customer service they'd have you bring it in and scan & clear it just to be sure and give you peace of mind.  No matter what the code is, having it pop up on the way home from the dealer is a little embarrassing for them IMO."
Nissan,307g3m,vorin,2,Wed Mar 25 12:29:39 2015 UTC,Yeah I kinda thought that too but it really sounded like he was sure it will turn out to be nothing major and he also mentioned they're booked all day today. I guess it is what it is.
Nissan,307g3m,Garbanian,1 point,Wed Mar 25 12:42:41 2015 UTC,"It goes both ways. A dealer saying ""don't drive an inch, we need to take care of this"" means that he doesn't trust the cars."

Nissan,307g3m,Moar_Deadmau5,1 point,Fri Mar 27 13:02:48 2015 UTC,Final update. Turned out to be something with a clamp on the EGR tube that wasn't tightened enough. Dealer fixed it within a few hours and I have my car back. I did contact that number and they started a case. They are going to have a specialist contact me by Monday. Any further advice on what I can say to the specialist?

Nissan,307g3m,rcrracer,2,Fri Mar 27 20:25:20 2015 UTC,I don't have anything printed out regarding the repair. They only gave me a verbal explanation of what they did. It honestly sounded like it was something as simple as tightening up a screw. They didn't give me a receipt or anything
Nissan,307g3m,morejosh,1 point,Fri Mar 27 23:10:57 2015 UTC,"From the couple comments about your experience with the dealer's service department, sounds like its time to consider a new dealer.  They didn't write anything up on your vehicle because they knew you would get a survey from Nissan, and that you'd be unhappy bringing your car in for service just days after buying it.  Customer Satisfaction index is a HUGE factor in ""money from Nissan"" for the dealer."
Nissan,307g3m,vorin,1 point,Sat Mar 28 01:56:47 2015 UTC,I did get a survey in my email just a day ago. I'm reluctant to answer it at the moment. I'd like to talk to the specialist who is supposed to reach out first
Nissan,307g3m,morejosh,1 point,Sat Mar 28 23:44:22 2015 UTC,Finally got a call back from the Specialist. Totally useless and a waste of time. The same thing would have been accomplished by doing nothing. Basically all that was said was thanks for bringing it to their attention and thanks for being a customer. I guess the last thing I can do is take this survey the dealership sent me.
Nissan,307g3m,morejosh,1 point,Mon Mar 30 21:57:36 2015 UTC,"Yea, without any repair orders or paperwork showing you've had it diagnosed there wouldn't be too much they can do. They'll take the dealerships side unless something shows up with proof of repair attempts :-\  They do have the ability to offer up to 250$ for service credits for anything Nissan related, but there has to be a big stink about it."
Nissan,307g3m,TheRealSpaceTrout,1 point,Tue Mar 31 00:36:22 2015 UTC,Damn man that sucks. But its probably nothing big. I'd say just call the dealer like you said and if it turns about something bad has happened I'm sure they would help accounting you got it brand new from them.

Nissan,3059tr,raybrant,1 point,Tue Mar 24 17:07:42 2015 UTC,TPMS' are pretty flimsy and are easily broken by careless tire shop employees. If they are installed properly and caution is taken when working around them they last a pretty long time. All it takes is one good whack and the sensor is done. Or you can be like me and just ignore the TPMS and never fix it :)
Nissan,305364,jonny4774,2,Tue Mar 24 15:37:25 2015 UTC,Wait a year for the new model. The 2015 will be much cheaper or you can get a completly redesigned truck that's not 10 years old.
Nissan,305364,alpine240,1 point,Tue Mar 24 17:29:25 2015 UTC,Damn you think im in need of a new truck Thats why I was considering it.
Nissan,305364,SgtBrowncoat,2,Tue Mar 24 17:46:38 2015 UTC,"The Frontier is a solid truck.  The frame is overbuilt when compared to the Tacoma; Frontier shares the chassis with the larger Titan and has a fully boxed frame all the way down the length of the truck.  The Tacoma is only boxed about half way back before it switches to the lighter c-channel rails.  The engine is solid, but is getting long in the tooth, so fuel economy won't be a selling point.    The SMOD or ""Strawberry Milkshake of Death"" problem was resolved several years ago, so you don't need to worry about the transmission being killed by the radiator.  Similarly, a redesigned timing chain tensioner would be in a 2015, so you should not have a costly replacement of that part at 100,000 miles.  The CV joints can take more angle before getting vibration or damage when compared to Toyota, so lifts up to 3"" are cheaper and easier since you don't have to do a diff drop.  The Frontier is a solid truck and if you don't mind the spartan utility-focused interior it is every bit the truck a Tacoma is - and more.  Really the only thing that it falls behind on is interior design, but for me that's a good thing because it is much easier to wipe down and clean.  Rumor is that the Frontier and Colorado will be introducing small diesel motors in the next generation.  I know you need a truck now, but that might be something to look forward to if you are going to be towing or hauling a lot and don't care so much about acceleration."

Don't know if CarMax works differently, though.   You have an approval on one car that is a lot cheaper than the other.   If you fall in love with the expensive one, there is no guarantee you well get an approval on it. Transferring multiple cars, esp with a big price variance, means you are still shopping.

That and weight reduction to 2800lbs which I really do want to see.  If they can make a Z that's in the 20-30k range, weigh 2800 lbs and have a decent turbo I4, I'll be happy.

Nissan,2ztngj,How_you_percolating,1 point,Sat Mar 21 17:42:14 2015 UTC,"Have not shopped for that engine, but typically it's a lot more money to swap the engine.  The valve guides can be done with the engine in the car.  The oil pan is a lot of work.  I took a look at the FSM for upper oil pan--it's a royal bitch.  You need to support the engine and remove the cradle, remove axles, etc.   Remove the front RH wheel and tire using power tool. Refer to WT-6, ""WHEEL AND TIRE ASSEMBLY"" . Disconnect the battery negative terminal. Remove the oil dipstick. Drain the engine coolant. Refer to CO-10, ""DRAINING ENGINE COOLANT"" . Remove the engine undercover. Remove the RH inner fender splash shield. Remove the A/C drive belt. Refer to EM-13, ""DRIVE BELTS"" . Remove the front exhaust tube. Refer to EX-3, ""Removal and Installation9. Remove coolant pipe bolts. Remove the A/C compressor with piping attached, and position it out of the way securely with wire. CAUTION: Do not pull on or crimp the A/C lines and hoses. Disconnect the coolant lines from the engine oil cooler and plug them to prevent coolant loss. Remove the oil filter and engine oil cooler from the upper oil pan. Remove the oil pressure switch/sensor, and the crankshaft position sensor (POS) from the upper oil pan. Remove the front drive shafts. Refer to FAX-11, ""Removal and Installation"" . Remove the front suspension member. Refer to FSU-16, ""Removal and Installation"" . Disconnect the heated oxygen sensors and air flow ratio (A/F) sensors and remove the two catalytic convertors from the exhaust manifolds using power tool. Refer to EM-27, ""Removal and Installation"" . Remove the rear plate cover from the upper oil pan.18. Loosen the lower oil pan bolts using power tool in order as shown. Remove the lower oil pan. a. Insert Tool between the lower oil pan and the upper oil pan. b. Slide the Tool by tapping its side (2) with a hammer to remove the lower oil pan from the upper oil pan. Loosen upper oil pan front bolts in the order shown. Remove the four upper oil pan to transaxle bolts. Remove the upper oil pan. a. Loosen the bolts in the order as shown, using power tool. b. Insert an appropriate size tool into the notch (1) of the upper oil pan as shown. c. Pry off the upper oil pan by moving the tool up and down (2) as shown."
Nissan,2ztngj,InfoSecGeek,1 point,Sun Mar 22 02:55:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah hah I have the FSM and looked at that, which is what prompted me to post this lol. How easy/ hard is it to do a valve guide job? I've worked on cars plenty, but never something this complicated."
Nissan,2ztngj,InfoSecGeek,1 point,Tue Mar 24 14:02:14 2015 UTC,"Sorry , I misread that, I was thinking timing-chain guides not valve guides. I could be wrong but assume you need to pull heads to do that. I would assume valve guides are pressed into heads,  Overall, to do the oil pan you have almost completely removed the engine, and it would probably be much easier to do the top-end work on an engine stand vs in the vehicle.  Heck, if it were out of the vehicle and you're looking at a ton of work on that motor, then a swap starts to look more attractive."
Nissan,2ztngj,InfoSecGeek,1 point,Tue Mar 24 15:31:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's looking to be better off swapping them out, but that brings my next question. Where's a good place to find a motor? I searched google for the motor, and ebay had the most listings but I'm kinda wary about that. A motor from the dealership would be 3k+ I imagine."
Nissan,2ztngj,InfoSecGeek,1 point,Tue Mar 24 15:43:00 2015 UTC,"Personally I would do some research to see if it's possible to drop in a newer model year, as you would find a lower-mileage one. Since an engine is so expensive, I would shop locally and see if you can pickup a salvage motor. Of course the standard joke is that every junkyard motor has 40K miles.  One thought though, is to look at what the car is worth, and it's running currently....at what point does it make sense to just punt and trade it in on another one. For example if you have an automatic, 2005 was not among the best year for Nissan....you could drop a grand into a engine swap only to have to drop another grand into a transmission. While I like my Maxima, there can be times you gotta 'cut and run'."

Nissan,2zpvyi,Patterzak,0,Tue Mar 24 12:36:34 2015 UTC,"Too bad the plan is for the IDx to have a CVT.  The Nismo might be available in a manual.  I would love one of these as a fun commuter car so I don't have to drive my XTerra all the time, but I'm a fan of driving cheap slow cars quickly (my '04 Civic was great for this).   This could be an MX-5 competitor if Nissan made it in RWD with a manual gear box, but that probably won't happen.  It will probably be a FWD (based on the Versa?) and have a CVT and it will end up being crap."
Nissan,2zpvyi,minizanz,7,Fri Mar 20 18:33:41 2015 UTC,They actually are supposed to have a manual transmission and they're RWD.

Nissan,2zpvyi,SgtBrowncoat,2,Fri Mar 20 20:37:08 2015 UTC,"Its actually too large to compete with the MX-5. It would be more in a class with the FRS if anything. There are actually reports that they are dropping the project anyway with the lack of display at the Detroit Auto Show and its strongest supporter leaving Nissan.   I hated how it looked anyway so Im glad they dropped it. Stupidest design if they wanted to bring back the ""spirited driving"" and ""nostalgia"" of the 510. I really like the concept, but I thought the execution was horrible. Im actually more excited about the Sway than the iDX."

Nissan,2zpvyi,Golden_frittata,1 point,Sat Mar 21 13:30:58 2015 UTC,"CVT would be okay if they still offered a manual of some sorts on certain models. If they just put a peppy four banger with a six speed and RWD, they would bring in hordes of new customers. What's missing from the car market right now is a cheap RWD sport sedan. This could be a game changer but I can't get my hopes up as Nissan has let me down quite a bit these last few years."
Nissan,2zpvyi,raybrant,-5,Sun Mar 22 05:30:46 2015 UTC,"Sorry to sound all tree hugger-ish but It would be cool if the  base was a hybrid with the cvt, while the nismo would come with a manual.

I have been a salesperson with Nissan for 8 years and we get more people worried about them because of a horror story they read on a review website than actually ones that go wrong.   From Nissan CVT Customer Satisfaction program. To provide customers with additional assurance regarding their overall cost of ownership we have doubled the warranty period for the transmission in all Model Year 2003 to 2010 Nissan models with a CVT. The existing powertrain warranty coverage of 5 years/60,000 miles will be extended at no cost, for CVT repairs, replacements or related towing, to 10 years/120,000 miles, whichever comes first.   http://www.nissanassist.com/faqs.php?menu=3"
Nissan,2zp478,i214,2,Fri Mar 20 13:29:48 2015 UTC,"R33 is pretty solid from a mechanical standpoint, the gearbox and engine are both strong. what you should be avoiding is cars that have electronic boost controllers, aftermarket engine management etc. When employed correctly they aren't dangerous but if you're buying a car without alot of knowledge of its history or owner I'd avoid mods like that just for peace of mind.  Google used vehicle buyers guide and follow the instructions for all the usual checks you should do on any used car.  Noticed you are in the UK so i guess rust would be a concern, wheel arches and the rear window to bootlid are hotspots for rust, also the strut towers in the engine bay.  The R33 has a turbo with a ceramic exhaust wheel which is prone to failure when boosted above the stock level."

Most of the time they start having problems after the factory powertrain warranty runs out, which is 60k miles. There will be a warranty extension on that vehicle unless it's been voided for some reason but that will show up when nissan runs the vin. Also no, I've put 3 or 4 transmissions in the same vehicle in a short time on several different Vehicles. It's more of a problem with design than parts. They just don't hold up,  even the new units to replace the broken ones, it's the same thing just new. It's not a revised part or anything, actually 90 percent of them are remanufactured So they're not even new.  Overall it's a good car, and I'm not telling you not to buy it. I'm telling you there is a high failure rate of transmissions on that model, and that's something you should be aware of. have the dealer check and make sure it has the CVT warranty extension,  if so you're good for at least 120,000 miles."

It's a fun car to drive, it handles well but its a VERY firm ride, and it stops well. It is unbelievably loud inside, to the point it's annoying to some.  As already stated, Google is your friend for specs and acceleration times and prices. Unsure of Sti pricing or speed, but an R/T challenger 5.7 will dust a 370 in a straight line, and can be had for about 28k New. SS camaro as well, though they cost in the 30s. Hell, you can buy an SRT challenger for about the same price as the nismo 370."

They've made slight interior changes. Not very mod friendly, I would imagine. The VVEL system would make any kind of cams pretty much impossible to do correctly. Not sure how easy they are to tune. I'm not sure what kind of power you can expect to get out of one. But I've seen several 350z with the stillen supercharger setup still not be able to outrun most American muscle cars. If you're going to mod one, skip the nismo and get a touring trim 370. There's only a 18 hp difference between the 2, and it's not noticeable. The touring has the big brakes, 6MT with Rev match, but has nicer seats, it's quieter, more comfortable,  better stereo, and costs less"
Nissan,2zk5a6,raybrant,1 point,Thu Mar 19 22:54:41 2015 UTC,If you plan on modding the Z you might as well just get a normal 370Z with the sport package and brakes. If power is your thing go for twin turbos off the bat and don't even bother with other small things like intakes and exhaust.

Old cars aren't inherently unreliable though - if you replace parts as they fail, and don't fall behind, a well-designed car (not a notoriously bad car) will continue to stay financially viable.

If you live in colder climates, it does not enjoy being driven cold and will need about 5-10 minutes of driving for everything to warm up comfortably.  Being lighter than almost anything on the road and with the 2.5L, it makes the drive home from work or to the grocery store that much more fun.   Its a great little car that doesn't draw too much attention to itself."

Nissan,2zfcr5,davvik,1 point,Wed Mar 18 02:37:37 2015 UTC,I had a similar issue with my 2003 and found that I had a failing coil pack.
Nissan,2zfcr5,Vampire1187,1 point,Wed Mar 18 04:17:36 2015 UTC,"Right, so in your case it was giving a weak spark but not bad enough to cause a noticeable misfire?  Do you know of a way to test the coil packs? I know there was at least 1 replaced on this car before I owned it since they are not all the same. It's not bad enough to cause a misfire that will throw a code. It does run somewhat rich which would line up with a bad spark.  Edit: Did some googling. Doing a power balance test tomorrow by unplugging coil packs."
Nissan,2zfcr5,baconfase,1 point,Wed Mar 18 04:27:25 2015 UTC,"Idle car. Unplug coilpack one at a time, plug it back in before moving to the next. If the engine runs worse with it unplugged then it's a good coilpack.  Once you did that for all 4 but they all pass, try again with the engine at some load, about 2k rpm. You'll need a buddy or properly placed brick.  I'd also suggest checking all grounds. Clean up corrosion. Make sure they're tight. etc.  You could also check your serpentine belt and belt tensioner. Not enough tension might slip the belt so the alternator can't do it's job properly. Or one of the pulleys may be bad and dragging the belt. The AC clutch could be bad and dragging the belt.  The car is notorious for not starting up on first crank when warm. So don't worry about that."
Nissan,2zfcr5,baconfase,1 point,Wed Mar 18 22:45:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd done the power balance test (by unplugging the coil packs) I'll get someone to help me with doing it under load. They all passed at idle. I checked the grounds but I'm going to go over them more thoroughly later. All I did was hook up jumper cables between battery/body/alternator while idling and paid attention to the idle. Saw no difference. There is little to no corrosion on battery/alt terminals and grounds. I couldn't see the engine ground from above. Got any tips on there this will be? Or does it just share the Alternator ground? If that's the case my alternator bracket may need some cleaning. I'm going to bring my multimeter by the shop to check for voltage drops across the grounds.  Serpentine belt looks fine but could possibly be stretched. No belt noise whatsoever. I'll check the A/C clutch, the tensioner and other pulleys spun fairly freely the last time I had the belt off.  I don't just mean not starting on first crank when warm, I mean not starting on first try. I'll crank the engine 4 to 6 times with no start, when I let go of the key the engine will fire 1 to 2 times and stop. Then as soon as I try the key again it will fire up in 1 to 2 cranks."
Nissan,2zfcr5,Vampire1187,1 point,Wed Mar 18 23:35:49 2015 UTC,"Off the top of my head, i think there are some grounds on the top of the timing chain cover, down and behind the battery, to the right of the battery to the body, and on the top of the alt bracket. You could even just make new grounds from electrical components. From your OP, it sounds like there is some power drain somewhere...but you already changed battery and alt...hm.  When you did the compression test did you do wet and dry?  When you changed your crank sensor did you make sure it was oem and the metal type? I've seen posts about aftermarket sensors being slightly too long and getting scored. Did you also change your cam sensor? It's essentially the same sensor but located in the head. My old crank sensor was the plastic type and when it went bad my tach did not work and starting the car took several seconds longer.  Do you hear the fuel pump prime when you turn the key to ACC? There should be an audible whine. It could still be weak but at least that way you know it's working.  If there's no problem with air, fuel or spark then last thing I could think of is your ECU is bad/going bad. Anything out of the ordinary happen/change when all this started happening?  Edit: You haven't mentioned an SES light but have you checked for any pending codes? You also note how you changed header but have you also loctited the butterfly valves in the intake manifold?"
Nissan,2zfcr5,Vampire1187,1 point,Thu Mar 19 00:18:12 2015 UTC,"I checked all of the grounds and running voltages and everything checked out good. I had the battery, alternator, and starter tested at a shop. Also checked out good. Current drawn from the battery when everything is off is ~10mA so there is no significant drain.  When I did the compression I only did dry. I didn't have time for the wet. I can do it again tomorrow night though, I have to borrow the test kit again though.  Crank sensor was changed by previous owner so I am not sure. They shop they had it serviced at is a mom-&-pop shop, so I don't know. I can take a look for it next time I'm under the hood, is the crank sensor easily visible from above? I know the cam sensor is. Also, tach works fine.  Fuel pump does prime. Ran a fuel pressure test that showed a solid 60 PSI. I read on the forums that it's supposed to be 50 PSI, could the FPR have failed and needs to be replaced?  Nothing out of the ordinary has happened in regards to ECU failure that I can think of... except, it did throw 1 code in December which could be around when this started. P0460 - Fuel Level Sensor. I just assumed this was for the sending unit for the fuel guage, so I just cleared the code and watched my Km's between fill ups. Fuel guage seemed to be working fine and the code never returned.  Only other code I got was when I cleaned the MAF and throttle body, I did the idle relearn and saw no codes so before I called it a night I just gave it a shot of throttle body cleaner into the intake. Car died instantly and I restarted it with no problems. It threw the code P0507 - Idle Control - Idle Higher than expected. This didn't make sense to me because the idle was 800RPM after cleaning the TB and MAF and I did the relearn just to be safe and the idle dropped to about 600. It threw the code after stalling itself out, not before the idle relearn.  When I had the TB off I stuck my camera inside the intake and all the butterfly screws are in place. When it gets warmer I'll loctite them but I am not worried as of right now.   I'm going to take another look at what this P0460 code could be."

Nissan,2yvffg,Zavyn87,1 point,Fri Mar 13 03:20:48 2015 UTC,"Short-ram air intakes are very loud, to the point of annoying. the genuine-Nismo CAI is the one I plan to buy, mine is 07.   You know if you just pull off all the resonator and so forth on the inlet side of the air intake, that gives you a little power boost and it sounds a little bit meaner...I pulled all that off mine including the lower part in front of the fender liner.   Overall don't buy a super-cheap filter system and don't over-oil the filter or you can destroy your mass-airflow sensor (oil contamination) and do bad things to engine.     I added a Racingline strut tower brace and Y-pipe. The y-pipe gives (allegedly) +13 hp on top end but hurts low-end torque a little. I like it, it does make the car feel stronger in the 4-6K rev range.     Brakes: For awhile I ran EBC green-stuff pads with their drilled & slotted rotors---great stopping, much too noisy--sounded like a 747 landing. Went to Akebono ceramic with regular Centric rotors and thats all I use now. EBC would be great for track, but not for street.   I added Goodridge stainless steel brake lines and run Motul DOT 5.1 fluid (5.1 is compatible with DOT 3 & 4). The SS brake lines improved pedal feel a tiny bit, but nothing much (these cars have terrible brake feel, IMHO). 5.1 is full-synthetic so has higher boiling point and does not absorb moisture.  Not sure I can tell difference with tower brace....allegedly it helps reduce torque-steer a bit.  Not to digress, but I use on Mobil-1 and Purolator Pur-1 filters and have swapped CVT and coolant. Replacing CVT fluid reduces whine.    In addition to replacing multiple broken motor mounts (twice), fixing A/C hose leak, and now a leaky steering rack, car is reliable."
Nissan,2yvffg,InfoSecGeek,1 point,Fri Mar 13 16:27:47 2015 UTC,+1 On a CAI. NA engines benefit more from a true CAI than with a short ram. Keeps temps down and in my opinion tend to look better. The tower brace is supposed to mainly help with body roll. You might be able to tell if you whip it around a corner.

Take, for example, the Nissan Note, a loose cousin to our Versa Note hatchback; on the Continent, the Note is very nearly a premium car. Here, the “Versa” badge marks it as deeply flawed.

Nissan,2yt2lq,TheSecretObjective,1 point,Mon Mar 23 11:45:42 2015 UTC,"Hi there. Thanks for the question. So, Juke. Totally depends on what you're using the car for. So, if you do less than 10,000 miles and the majority of that journey is on town roads and in and out driving, I'd suggest the N-Tec 1.2 petrol. Reasons why; it's got very good specs. Sat nav, blue tooth, auto lights and wipers, reversing camera. It's cheaper than the tekna and the only difference is in the tekna you get heated leather seats and folding mirrors.   If you're doing 10,000 miles but the majority is motorway/highway I'd go for the diesel in the same range, the N-Tec.   More than 15,000? Diesel all the way.  Protect your self against devaluation by going for an outlandish metallic paint such as the yellow or purple. They'll hold their value more because they'll be more sort after.   Personally, the most modern way to buy a car is a personal contract purchase plan, where you take the car over 3 years with a guaranteed future value. On your 36th month of driving, nip back in and trade it in to start a new PCP on a new car.   That's my advice. Need any more questions or any more info, just ask.  Brett."

I'd be doing less then 10,000 miles, so the petrol 1.2 makes sense. I have been leaning towards the Tekna, but I didn't realise there was so little difference between it and the N-Tec, but heated leather seats seem to be calling to me. A PCP type of situation is probably the way I'm going to go. The paint idea is also something to consider. It will be a few months until I have to make a decision, but you've helped greatly.

Adjustment requires measuring how far away from spec it is currently and buying new shims to get the correct clearance. Here's a thread explaining it further. Requires you to take the head and cams off. If you're doing it yourself it'll just be the cost of the shims which would be around $100. Add labor to that if you're taking it somewhere to do, about 3-5 hrs maybe.  Valves would be a lot louder too if you're closer to your oil change interval. Fresh oil dampens the sound better."

Nissan,2yss0k,raybrant,1 point,Thu Mar 12 17:34:24 2015 UTC,"Go on YouTube and listen to some hydraulic lash that's out of spec. It'll sound like loud clacking from the top of your engine so it'll sound pretty shallow whereas knocking from the bottom of your engine would sound more deep. Adjusting hydraulic lash isn't too bad, if you can turn a wrench you can do it.  Don't know what you mean by valve rings (valve seals?). Yes valve seals would be easy to do once you're in there, would just require manipulating your piston so your valve doesn't drop into your chamber or if you just pull the entire head out it's easy to do on your workbench."

Well for one thing some people like a manual, for another because the CD009 transmission is one of the better OEM manual transmissions around in terms of holding power.  There's a reason you can find adapter plates to bolt one up to anything from an LS to a 2JZ, because it's stout as hell making it a very cost effective option when building a ""slow luxo coupe"" that will smoke 99% of the cars on the road."

Nissan,2ymxjo,mikefitzvw,0,Wed Mar 11 02:47:16 2015 UTC,"I've only messed with timing on older cable connected throttle cars so I've never dealt with TPS. I can only assume you have to disconnect the TPS prior to adjusting timing so that when you reconnect it and start it up, it'll relearn the position of the throttle instead of using the old settings. Better to shut the car off then reconnect the TPS.  As for modern cars, the ECU accounts for advancing and retarding timing so if you were to dump premium in a Versa for example, it'll automatically advance timing to take advantage of the premium gas (which won't benefit a car like a Versa much). For sports cars with higher compression and especially turbo cars, you'll see the difference more."
Nissan,2ymxjo,raybrant,1 point,Wed Mar 11 11:32:16 2015 UTC,"This is cable-connected, but it still has a TPS (no idea why, but it likes to know where the throttle is anyway).

Nissan,2yh9bl,hombre_lobo,4,Mon Mar 9 20:21:41 2015 UTC,"First of all your mechanic sounds like a snake-oil salesman. Run away, far away, seriously.  What sort of an 'engine flush' is he talking about?  If you change your oil and the car has 35K, it needs no flushing of any sort. That's complete BS.   Your rear brakes may be just fine.   First of all, brake pads have a 'wear indicator' which is a piece of tin that scrapes on the rotor when they are worn out. It sounds terrible, but it's harmless. If you don't hear a screeeccchh sound like tin dragging on steel when you step on, or release the brakes, you're good for now.  Assuming your car has rear disc brakes (pretty sure it does), you can often see the brake pads just by leaning down and looking at the brakes if the car has alloy wheels.  (see link below that has photos)  If yours has steel wheels with wheel covers, you may need to poke around under the car with a flashlight, or worst-case, have a trusted mechanic (not this guy) take off a wheel and have a look.   The brake pads have a metal backing plate that is about 1/4"" thick and the brake pad friction material, when new, are about 1/2"" thick.     If it appears that the backing plates are flush to the rotor, yes, you need new brake pads now.  BUT,if the pads are about the same thickness as the backing plate (about 1/4"")  you've got probably 15K miles left.  (However, note that the inner brake pad wears faster, typically, so be sure both inner and outer pads were inspected). A simple brake inspection can save you money http://oceanautocare.com/simple-brake-inspection-can-save-money/   IMHO you need a new mechanic, not new brakes."
Nissan,2yh9bl,InfoSecGeek,1 point,Tue Mar 10 15:38:15 2015 UTC,"^ This. I had a dealership pull same BS with my Rogue, they said it was like 2 or 3 mm so when I take it home, I put it on jack and take the caliper off and measure it myself, 6mm. Needless to say I was quite livid.   Also when someone says you need an Engine Flush, just walk away. There's list of suggested maintenance you do in the owner's manual at mile intervals but doesn't always mean it's needed."
Nissan,2yh9bl,Exolis87,1 point,Wed Mar 11 01:30:52 2015 UTC,"Yup, my stealership said I needed new rear pads at like 8mm, and I even started getting coupon mailers from them for brake service...that was like a year ago and now they are about at 5mm.   Unless there is something wrong, or the car is used for taxi service, the rear pads typically go for as long as 50k, while maybe 40k on the front, but YMMV."
Nissan,2yh9bl,InfoSecGeek,0,Wed Mar 11 14:30:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Fuck this guy.  You never flush anything except your coolant. Every fluid system in a car is designed for drain and fill.  At 35k miles you don't need anything besides gas. Like this man said, you'll hear the brakes if you need them changed and air filters only need to be changed about every 60k miles."

Nissan,2ye1b2,gehzumteufel,2,Mon Mar 9 02:08:51 2015 UTC,You're welcome.   What power are you aiming for?   What's the intended use for the car?
Nissan,2ye1b2,_ActionDan_,2,Mon Mar 9 02:11:24 2015 UTC,I'm hoping to get around 550whp on 93 octane. Might play with E47 in the future.  It'll be mostly street/strip. Might see a road course or Tail of the Dragon on occasion for giggles.
Nissan,2ye1b2,erichthegr8,2,Mon Mar 9 02:22:58 2015 UTC,"Over 400rwkw on 93 octane? That's very impressive.  Do you guys not have any better fuel?   ""Performance"" cars are tuned on 98 at worst here, E85 for more dedicated cars.   We did have some nice 100RON here locally 98 with a little Ethanol on top, but they canned it so it's back to 98 for me."
Nissan,2ye1b2,bmcnult19,2,Mon Mar 9 02:45:32 2015 UTC,In my area 93 is the best pump fuel. I have access to 100 octane but it is almost 3x the price. E85 is scarce around here which is why I was leaning towards possibly doing E47 which is 50/50 of 93 and E85. I'll have to buy a storage/transport container to go get the E85 though. I've also kicked around the idea of water/methanol injection with the 93 octane. We'll see how close I get to the 55whp mark before making any decisions!
Nissan,2ye1b2,bmcnult19,2,Mon Mar 9 02:56:28 2015 UTC,"Good luck and be sure to post a dyno graph when you get it, should make some nice torque with that setup."

Nissan,2ye1b2,raybrant,1 point,Mon Mar 9 03:05:40 2015 UTC,"I don't know where you reside, but I am going to assume likely Europe or Oz. As such, if I remember correctly, you guys measure octane different than we do. In fact, we actually measure with the AKI or AntiKnock Index. Which is (MON+RON)/2. And following that, 100RON = ~94AKI. So it's nearly equal."

Nissan,2yc9b9,whoooooooooooooosh,1 point,Tue Mar 17 04:27:41 2015 UTC,"Sticker price around 26500, I got it for 23k with 3.3% interest from Nissan. I had a trade in, a '97 Ford Explorer Eddie Bauer edition that accounted for $1000 off, the rest were rebates from Nissan/dealership.   The dealership I went through also has a lifetime drive train warranty for after the 60 month Nissan warranty.  Oh, and I get free car washes for life from the dealership too.   My friend actually got a Rogue a few days before me. She went through a different dealership and got a used 2014 Rogue SV with 24k miles on it for 22k, so considering I got the 2015 SV AWD brand new (it had 9 miles on it) for only $1000 more, I like to think I got a good deal.  My only issue with the whole thing is it didn't come with floor mats. None. Like, really? It has push button ignition and back up camera... But no floor mats? The dealership said I could buy a set, but they cost like $175. I went to WalMart and bought a set for $25, which I think were actually nicer because they're pretty thick rubber and can just be hosed off.  EDIT: If you're thinking about getting a Rogue, I do NOT recommend the Rogue ""Selects"". Those are older body style, essentially they're on a Sentra's chassis, where as the Rogue SVs and up are on a frame specially engineered to be a Rogue/SUV. The Selects do not drive as well and they feel really cramped. Plus the interior just looks dated, even for a new car. You'll feel the difference if you test drive a select, then test drive an SV+. The SLs are super nice, but I just didn't feel like I needed all the extra crap they came with.   I will say, my GF has a 2010 Ford Edge Platinum, and those are super nice crossovers. I think her car has more power and looks just as slick in the inside. If you're in the market for a crossover, I would recommend an Edge too. I still think her car is nicer, I just didn't want to be one of ""those"" couples with matching cars."
Nissan,2yc9b9,whoooooooooooooosh,1 point,Tue Mar 17 04:56:07 2015 UTC,"This is great info, thanks. I want your exact car but with a moon roof. Your friend sounds like she didn't get the best deal. I'm glad you mentioned the floormats, because I remember seeing a charge for them when I saw the msrp window sticker and thought wow, that is lame. either way I would get the rubber ones too since I'm in a winter climate. So I'm glad you mentioned it.   Really appreciate the info! Thanks again."
Nissan,2yc9b9,whoooooooooooooosh,0,Tue Mar 17 15:54:57 2015 UTC,"If you want a moonroof, you're probably going to end up with an SL, if you're wanting AWD too, you're looking at 31k. Why do you want a moon roof? Almost every car I've had up to this one had moon roof/sun roof and they were more trouble than they were worth. Even the sunroof on the decked out Edge my GF has leaked when she first got it and the dealer had to fix it... And it's still not 100%. My sister has a 2011 Acura RDX with a sunroof and it gets stuck closing. If you live in a winter climate, sounds like you won't even be able to open it most of the year.  I mean if you really want one, I guess you want one. Just not worth it IMHO"

Nissan,2y9m5t,chillydoe,0,Sat Mar 7 19:37:14 2015 UTC,Looks like the iacv. You need to try from under the clip. Pushing down from the top wont release it. It should be the same style as the purple clip. Lift up on the plug as the male part is attached to the main and not the plug. Good luck.
Nissan,2y9m5t,nismo44,3,Sat Mar 7 21:18:00 2015 UTC,"this is not true.  This is a spring lock clip, used on numerous engine control system sensors.  The way to release these is to push the green clip TOWARDS the sensor, while pulling the entire connector away from the sensor.  Sometimes debris can build up in the spring part of the connector and make this tough to do.  Keep at it, it will release.  Also, this is not the IACV.  IACV is mounted on the bottom of the throttle body and is no where in this picture."

I reread what i wrote and am convinced it wasn't clear as i think you think i meant just pry on it, which isn't what i meant, these usually are always stuck but I've found that by pressing the spring down and using a small screw driver to help usually works.  anyway the point being OP should be able to get the clip off if they keep trying and that it is the iacv."

On the other hand, if the car is on (i.e. already pressed the on/off button) anyone can drive off with the vehicle. I always think about this when I debate to turn off the car for quick stops."
Nissan,2y5tbq,Megawhatt24,2,Fri Mar 6 18:44:05 2015 UTC,If you're not doing it yourself just head down to the local dealership and have them install a remote start. You will use the same key.

Nissan,2y5tbq,Brutl,1 point,Sat Mar 7 15:43:39 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, as of now, the Rogue isnt supported by the factory add on option.  As far as any aftermarket kit, they will take the circuit board from one of your existing remotes and wire it into the aftermarket kit.  With an I-key, there is simply no way around this."
Nissan,2y5tbq,Exolis87,1 point,Sat Mar 7 22:14:43 2015 UTC,"You would have to ask the dealer to see if they would install a 3rd party Remote Start since Rogue does not have RES available. My guess is they probably won't because they tend to stick to OEM work only.   As for keeping the fobs, you would have to see how whatever 3rd party RES device worked in order to keep using the Original Fob or not."

Nissan,2y65fa,labradordude,3,Fri Mar 6 20:29:14 2015 UTC,"Hi, in all honesty? None. I started in the Motor industry about two years ago. Before that I held a few different jobs. You need a fire in your belly. I left school with no qualifications to speak of and didn't do well at college.   If it's something you're serious on, get your CV to some dealerships.

Nissan,2y350j,xxsheepdoggxx,2,Fri Mar 6 00:56:57 2015 UTC,"What's your background? Are you looking at getting into Automotive Journalism as a profession? Are you a photographer?   I'm guessing you're a photographer who is trying his hand at the journalism aspect?   I was once a blogger doing some auto freelance and ended up getting paid to do it so I have some minimal exposure to the industry and to the harsh realities of submitting your work to the editing team. I wrote for www.themotorreport.com.au the editor over there was an excellent teacher.   My TL;DR version is I love the pics, but the text needs some work.   Punctuation in particular is letting you down a little. Missing commas, too many short sentences in quick succession where you could re-word and improve the flow.   EG:  ""Hello fellow car lovers, what I have for you today is a story about seeing your dreams through.  In particular, one mans dream to own a very special car.    Could easily be:  ""Hello fellow car lovers, what I have for you today is a story about seeing your dreams through - In particular, one mans dream to own a very special car. ""  The only change is the full stop, but it adjusts the level of pause and the break in flow that a reader encounters. Those two elements are intrinsically linked anyway, no need to break them up.   Alternatively, look for neater ways to say the same thing (a thesaurus is your best friend here) You could go with something like:  ""Hello fellow car lovers, what I have for you today is the inspiring story of one man's perseverance to own a rare and special car.""  Do some reading on punctuation and get a really good feel for appropriate use of commas and full stops in particular.   Again, love the pics, good effort all round.   (R34s are on of my Fav cars and it'll be either one of those or an R35 when I fulfill my promise of buying another GT-R).   EDIT: Before anyone jumps on me. I was by no means a pro nor do not put in considerable effort on reddit posts. The language and tone I use here vs in an article are markedly different."
Nissan,2y350j,_ActionDan_,2,Mon Mar 9 02:06:57 2015 UTC,^ This is what i was looking for.  Thanks man I shoot photos for a couple car websites and am branching myself out to include the stories with them to make some more $$.  It is only my third write up and probably the first time ever writing something I was not required to write by school etc..  Appreciate your time and the advice!
Nissan,2y350j,_ActionDan_,1 point,Mon Mar 9 02:45:18 2015 UTC,The best thing you can do is keep doing the freelance thing whilst also reaching out to other websites and offering your services - for free to start with.  In particular a website that is growing slowly as they may have need for assistance and in many cases (so long as you don't suck completely) it's quicker for them to edit up a document than it is to create it from scratch.   I was working full time while also doing 3-6 articles a day for TMR before I decided it wasn't for me.   Keep at it.
Nissan,2y350j,_ActionDan_,1 point,Mon Mar 9 02:52:29 2015 UTC,"Wont do it for free.  Publicity is not worth what people think it is, those who want the content and the publicity would be good enough to do it for free know you are worth paying.  My writing at the moment I would never charge for but I know my photos are good, just started writing to be more competitive.    Good advice on the freelancing though has worked well for me the past year, just need to focus more on bringing people back to me now."

The heater is a simple system, once the t-stat opens up it routes to a heater core hooked up to a fan. The hot coolant has to make it to the heater core for you to get heat. Several things can attribute to no heat: air in the cooling system, stuck closed t-stat (you would overheat in this scenario), heater delete, leaky heater core, etc... Diagnose it first."

Nissan,2xvg51,Meowfest,2,Wed Mar 4 04:32:59 2015 UTC,"To confuse things, you have multiple problems at the same time. If I had to guess I would say 'bad ground connection at battery' and 'faulty mass airflow sensor (MAF)'.  You said ""when the battery cables were jiggled all the dash lights came on"". Whatever you jiggled is faulty.   A common mistake when testing is to assume that a connection that measures conductivity can actually carry enough current to do the job. In some cases a wire is broken or corroded inside the insulation, or a ground wire is simply loose. If wires are corroded, cleaning them up is often not enough, you gotta replace them.  Have DTC (trouble codes) been retrieved from the computer? If the engine is stalling, then is able to run again, it's probably some sort of a sensor such as Mass Airflow Sensor (MAF), Throttle Position Sensor or Crank Position Sensor, however those are only a guess, and the scan tool should point you in the right direction. The MAF is the most likely culprit.    Has the check engine light been on?  Keep in mind that if the battery is disconnected, the computer has to re-learn the idle mixture and speed, so the engine idling slowly after it has lost battery power, that's normal until it resets itself."
Nissan,2xvg51,InfoSecGeek,1 point,Wed Mar 4 15:31:43 2015 UTC,"This is good advice. To add to it, buy a cheap volt/multimeter. Measure the voltage at battery terminals when the car is in Ignition On and then again with Engine running. If it doesn't jump to 13V+, then Alternator or connections to alternator are no good. Also measure the voltage of the engine block to the battery terminal, if it's above 1V, the Ground to the engine block is bad."

Nissan,2xtn00,BigBuffalo757,1 point,Wed Mar 4 05:52:56 2015 UTC,"If it's some kind of rod knock or something like that, it's just as detrimental as any other engine.  One advantage to the Z31 is that the VG30E engine came in quite literally everything Nissan made with a V6 in the 80s.  You can go to a junkyard and get another for a few hundred dollars out of a Maxima, Quest, Pathfinder, pickup, M30, 200SX V6.  So getting a replacement engine isn't hard, and pulling the engine on them isn't all that bad either."
Nissan,2xtn00,jaqattack02,1 point,Wed Mar 4 13:34:47 2015 UTC,How does one determine if its something major mechanically wrong with the engine instead of carbon build up/bad plugs/low octane?  Can a shop determine this before I buy said car (if the seller is willing that is).
Nissan,2xtn00,BigBuffalo757,1 point,Wed Mar 4 17:00:44 2015 UTC,"I had one. There are no cheap parts for it. At the time, autozone and advance were all I had, and my employee discount helped. Stuff that is generic to Nissan will be the same price across the board. But Zs are special and do you really want to go putting stock-ish parts under there? I got rid of the Z and ended up with a Stanza. Way cheaper, all the stuff off the 240SX fit it performance wise.   If you are set on keeping it, they may not be the cheapest part, but they are almost always the right part:  http://www.zparts.com/"

Nissan,2xt7lq,ArcticGamer,1 point,Tue Mar 3 18:17:22 2015 UTC,"I had 2 Nissan Sentras (2011 SL / 2012 Special Edition). I bought the 2011 brand new off the lot and later hit a deer with it. Prior to totaling the car I loved it. Plenty of space in a little compact 4 door and a decent amount of zip on the road. With the CVTs gas milage is great (I delivered pizza while going through college with both of these cars) When I got my 2012 the only real differences were a few changes on the body and it lacked a back-up camera. I loved it too. I then traded that in to get my Altima Coupe. (which is actually in your price range as well) I love my AC. It's fully loaded with Bose, leather, HID's and it's a 6-speed which makes it more fun (but less gas efficient) than the Sentras.   My biggest tips (if your buying from a dealership) are to go through the online sales (don't walk on the lot without talking to them first) and look for Nissan certified used cars. I got my 2012 Special Edition Sentra and the extended warranty put me at ease. There are some people that will say dont worry about it cause more than likely nothing will happen to the car (and they're probably right) but I've always been a better-safe-than-sorry kind of guy."
Nissan,2xt7lq,BigBuffalo757,1 point,Tue Mar 3 18:51:56 2015 UTC,"Interesting...So it comes down to a Sentra or a Altima Coupe? I was looking online and saw that Versas run from 11 to about 13k. I dont remember the model name, but the 13k model gets 31/40 to the gallon, and teh cheaper was like 5-10 lower respectively. Tempted to go for the ""plus"" model"
Nissan,2xt7lq,BigBuffalo757,1 point,Tue Mar 3 19:05:54 2015 UTC,I mean that was just for me. If your interested in the Versas I would totally go for it. I looked at them when I was buying my Sentras and they were just too small and didn't have enough for me personally. That being said the Versa is probably going to be the best on gas.   If you're looking for something in between the Sentra or the Coupe maybe look at the Sentra SE-R Spec V? I believe the last year they made them was 2012. It's a Sentra with a 2.5L engine and 6-speed transmission. If you're looking for more fun but still decent gas mileage that might be a good choice.   Also keep in mind the Altima Coupe comes in both 2.5/3.5 flavors. The 3.5 Manual is fairly rare. The 2.5 CVTs get pretty good gas mileage while still keeping the body style. The bad seats in the Altima Coupes are crapped as all get out so if you need space dont get the AC. I'm not sure what year they stopped making the 3.5 but it was earlier and I don't think they make new coupes anymore. I believe they stopped in 2013.  Have you looked into the Juke at all? you may be able to find a used on within range (probably barely).
Nissan,2xt7lq,BigBuffalo757,1 point,Tue Mar 3 19:43:45 2015 UTC,"well i dont want TOO small of a car, trunk space and all is important, honestly i  might just look into sentras"
Nissan,2xt7lq,pilmini,1 point,Tue Mar 3 20:00:21 2015 UTC,Yea that's why I stayed away from the Versa's myself.  Bottom line (in my opinion) if you can find a Sentra SE-R Spec V with low miles and at a decent price that's what I would get. They look fairly sporty for a compact sedan and 200hp in that little ass car sounds like it would be fun as hell. If you don't know how to drive a manual then just get a regular Sentra or learn. I learned how to drive manual just so I could get my AC and I love it. But if you do a lot of city driving with a lot of traffic jams manual might be something to stay away from.
Nissan,2xt7lq,pilmini,1 point,Tue Mar 3 20:23:56 2015 UTC,"My dealership has lots of prior rental cars, mainly altimas that are at 20k or below. As soon as they hit 25k miles they come to our lot to sell. Look for those."
Nissan,2xswe6,rxbandit256,1 point,Tue Mar 3 16:57:59 2015 UTC,"My $.04 is that since most babies tend to be of a fairly similar size, their seats are all roughly the same dimensions especially since all car seats are now compatible with the Lower Anchors and Tethers for Childrens Systems (LATCH) standard.   2008 Frontier has LATCH tiedown points as well as seatbelt ALRs (Automatic Locking Retractors) to lock the belt retractor when you pull belt out all the way--so you do not need to buy seatbelt locking clips, but be sure to use the ALR.    Of course its also important to use the third-tether mounting point and top tether strap as that prevents car seat from rotating in a crash.    Note that if you've got the crew-cab jumpseats it's critical not to attach the third tether to the belt guide, but rather to the anchor point (see page 26 of your owners manual). And am pretty sure the jumpseats do not have latch anchors."

Nissan,2xnozw,iamfrankfrank,2,Tue Mar 3 00:03:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, I run a pretty beefy supercharged build with everything necessary to make the car relatively happy (minus the clutch upgrade that goes in end of this month).  http://www.the370z.com/showthread.php?t=71817  Boosting these cars is a crapshoot and they are very difficult to tune properly.  There's a reason Cobb won't touch the VQ37...  The group of people who can work on these cars and know what they're doing once they are highly customized is fairly small and they know it.  You will pay near-GTR prices to have someone work on it mostly because they are a massive headache and things break constantly.   My mechanic and his wife hate me but I'm putting their kids through college.    There are guys who boost these cars and throw a rod instantly and there are guys who run around on 650whp on a non built block and swear they're fine.  Regardless of where you end up, understand that replacing a VQ37 long block is going to run you a minimum of 13k in parts, labor and accessories (likely more than that).  Of the 12 months of 2014, I had my car in my possession for 4 of those...  Edit:  Welp I'm on my phone and thought this was a PM reply.  Apologies for shitting up your thread.   I gave up linking to the actual upgrades pretty quickly so uh...you'll have to read the thread if you're interested.

Nissan,2xnozw,iamfrankfrank,1 point,Tue Mar 3 00:13:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the details Frank. This was just the insight I needed as I would be shooting blind the moment I want to start modifying it. I really have only looked into the Stillen kits for forced induction as I definitely have no intention of going with a single or twin turbocharger setup. I am very hesitant of any large modifications that I could not reverse easily for warranty purposes. Are the centrifugal kits made by Stillen the only options or are there other avenues to approach as far as complete setups and tuning go? I have built entire cars before, so a kit that I could put on myself and have a shop tune would be a plus."
Nissan,2xnozw,Schnabulation,1 point,Tue Mar 3 03:12:17 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, your only blower option is Stillen now that GTM went tits up.  It's a shame too since the GTM kit put down more power and caused less issues than the Stillen variant (the Stillen variant is carb legal in California).  The other advantage to the Stillen blower is that it's self-lubricating where the GTM kit required tapping oil lines.  Certainly easier to install if you're doing it yourself so there's that.  Also rotary blowers are your only option.  There's no twin screw or posi option out there (and I don't know where you'd put it anyway).  The Stillen kit comes with a pre-set tune that you just flash onto your ECU.  From what I have read unless your tuner really knows their shit, you absolutely should not tinker with Stillen's tune.  Bad, bad things have happened to people who have tried."

The fact is many people do like the XTerra and due to the low R&D cost and tooling cost of doesn't make sense not to build it.

It is more likely that we won't see a replacement at all, or until the F-Alpha chassis is phased out globally.  Edit: I have 177k on mine and the only rattles I have are of my own crap moving around.  The interior is solid, especially when compared to my last Jeep.

Nissan,2wyqd4,mechabeast,1 point,Tue Feb 24 20:58:15 2015 UTC,"I am just a snob when it comes to Jeeps and having owned many Toyotas including FJ40s and currently an FJC, the Xterra is worthy of comparison and the jeeps are severely disappointing."
Nissan,2wyqd4,mechabeast,1 point,Tue Feb 24 22:02:37 2015 UTC,2014 was the last model year for the FJ Cruiser.  I'd say the closest remaining vehicle is the 4Runner.
Nissan,2wyqd4,spilk,1 point,Tue Feb 24 20:52:28 2015 UTC,"Oh im not hating on the Xterra - i love it its great in its own way  None of their cross overs are true off roaders like the Xterra - i hope they dont get rid of it because even the pathfinder has lost its truck frame - its basically a van now  I have seen tonnes of Xterras all past 200,000 km and some of the interior does rattle over time - but it is def. Better than a Jeep (i work at a Nissan/Infiniti shop) it also depends on the owner though"
Nissan,2wyqd4,spilk,1 point,Tue Feb 24 19:22:20 2015 UTC,"As someone in sales, I can attest that this was a long time coming.

Nissan,2wyqd4,Bt1222,2,Tue Feb 24 15:04:57 2015 UTC,"With Toyota killing the FJ Cruiser I would think the XTerra becomes more desirable.  Now Jeep really will be the only offering in the class.  I was hoping for a Gen 3 XTerra with a small diesel, and I know a lot of other people were too."

I just bought a used 2012 XTerra a few months ago so I'm certainly not in the market for anything, but I'm just hoping that in 5-10 years there's something I can replace it with that will be an improvement in some way (fuel economy, power, off-road prowess, etc) but maintain a similar form factor."

Nissan,2wyqd4,IDontWantANewUser,1 point,Tue Feb 24 21:32:49 2015 UTC,"Agreed... this was inevitable.  The market for this kind of beast gets smaller year by year.  Comparing it to a Wrangler is not completely apples-to-apples.  The JK is an iconic convertible, and Chrysler has done a great job hammering home that point and capitalizing on it.  Put another way, I don't think an XTerra would have been the 2nd choice for most Jeep buyers."

Nissan,2wtbiu,justhisguyouknow,2,Mon Feb 23 04:15:40 2015 UTC,"Completely depends on how much salt they throw down on the road or how much salt water overspray you get if you live by the coast.  Most cars built in the last 10 years are pretty good about not rusting straight away.

The radiators contain a tube that carries AT fluid, if it corrodes and the coolant gets into the AT it will cause it to froth and destroy the transmission.  There is a free fix.  Google ""Nissan radiator bypass mod"" for directions, essentially you just unplug two hoses, switch them, and plug them back in.  Thousands of dollars saved.  Other than that I don't know of any issues.  That generation Pathy is pretty solid and built on the F-Alpha chassis.  If you plan to go off road, try to find the Off Road edition (it says OFF ROAD on the front doors).  This trim has a locking rear diff, which is like a magic ""make more traction"" button.

Nissan,2wo1ay,Zavyn87,2,Sat Feb 21 16:44:24 2015 UTC,On my Altima Coupe you have to remove the front bumper and the entire headlight assembly to get to the bulb. It's honestly not hard at all. Just a few body clips and a couple of screws holding on the front bumper. To be honest with you 80-120 sounds about right since most mechanics charge about 60-80 bucks an hour and this is going to be an 1 - 1.5 hour job.   Theres no special tools to get the bumper off. Just need a flathead and phillips head screw driver.

Nissan,2wo1ay,BigBuffalo757,1 point,Sat Feb 21 22:32:41 2015 UTC,Well then...sounds like it might be worth the charge in labor.   Also I don't know what bulbs you got but if they were cheaper HID's they will obviously get the job done but they may burn out quicker so then you will have to go through this process again. HID bulbs are one thing I would also get the OEM part for. But that's just me.  Whatever you decide to do - good luck with it and say warm my Canadian friend.
Nissan,2wo1ay,BluAnimal,1 point,Sun Feb 22 05:52:41 2015 UTC,"I had a light go out on my 2009 Altima, the price to change the bulb as well as the bulb itself was $20. Not sure what they're trying to do here."
Nissan,2wo1ay,BigBuffalo757,1 point,Sat Feb 21 18:26:19 2015 UTC,He has HID headlights. Not as easy to change the bulb.
Nissan,2wo1ay,InfoSecGeek,1 point,Sat Feb 21 20:30:23 2015 UTC,"And on 6th gen Maxima, it's a lot trickier, especially for HIDs.  I have replaced both bulbs on my Maxima at least three times. (non HID)  There are three ways to do it:   The factory service manual says to pull the front bumper and unbolt the headlight housings. As far as I can tell I think there is less clearance with HID since the ballast and so forth is in there too (in other words with HID you probably gotta pull the bumper). You can do it by turning the steering wheel to one side and unclipping inner fender liners and shoving your hand up in there. On driver side you need to remove airbox and on passenger side the coolant tank and bracket and fill-tube for washer fluid.  Many other automakers put access panels in their fender liners to make this easier. I am either lucky or good, but managed to change the passenger front lamp in about 20 minutes by just pulling coolant tank/bracket and washer-fluid tube. Did that last night."
Nissan,2wo1ay,03Titanium,1 point,Tue Feb 24 19:36:05 2015 UTC,OEM for cars is 4300-5000k (I think BMW puts 5k). But the color they output when they are old is something like 5500-6000k. Those 6k bulbs you bought will be really blue when they age

Nissan,2wj6jq,V_WhatTheThunderSaid,2,Mon Feb 23 16:33:23 2015 UTC,"Depending in what setting I guess. Drifting - you'll probably find the S15 (assuming its got the basic drift setup with coilovers, less the Helical gear) is much more snappy and balanced on a grassroots level. R33 with the 25det will give you that power advantage over the SR20DET so there is that major difference. Daily driven - probably won't feel much difference as its daily - you'll probably enjoy the S15 look more over the extra ponies the R33 gives. Grip - cannot comment.  this is a basic run down"

Nissan,2wj4zm,LiteSh0w,3,Fri Feb 20 09:02:25 2015 UTC,"mrich1092 gave some solid advice.  Secondary things I'd keep in mind as well:  3) Cam/Crank sensor. The older plastic-type may cause issues. If you need to replace them, make sure they are the metal-type. OEM (ie buy from the dealership) is better than aftermarket sensors, but they are pricey (~$90 each).  4) Coilpacks are another old-car-maintenance item. Relatively easy and free to diagnose, but again pricey to buy. And again, OEM beats aftermarket.  5) The overhead panel with the sunglass bin [and possibly sunroof controls] will begin to rattle someday and eventually sag like it's going to fall off because it's held up by a plastic tab. It was simply engineered badly.  6) The rear suspension is a beam and you cannot change the rear wheel alignment with shims or bolts or etc. However, if you have strange friends with special jigs and machines you can bend the beam. What I'm trying to say is don't pay for a 4-wheel alignment because you can only align the 2 front wheels.  Fun bits: The QR25 has great low end torque. It's undersquare and has a terrible rod:stroke ratio so if you want power the best route is turbo/sc. The 6-speed transmission is bulletproof and comes with helical-LSD. It's pretty close-ratio especially 1st and 2nd.  The aftermarket is small compared to more popular platforms but does exist. There is also a small community for the b15 platform.

Nissan,2wj4zm,mrich1092,2,Sun Mar 1 01:38:11 2015 UTC,"1) make sure to replace the pre-cat with aftermarket headers or gut it.  The particles inside the pre-cat are known to get sucked into the engine and destroy it.   2)  inspect the butterfly screws inside the intake manifold and loctite them. It's a common issue for the screws to get sucked into the engine and score the cylinder walls and eventually killing the engine.   If you can fix these two issues you should be golden as long as you keep up with maintenance   I never had any issues with it until I literally hit the 100,000 mark. It started having these random misfires and I couldn't for the life of me figure it out. After months of trying to get the issue solved I eventually gave up and just sold it and got 2012 Honda Accord coupe.

Nissan,2wcyif,nitroneil,4,Wed Feb 18 21:59:22 2015 UTC,Is that the V8 Altima supercar? I really want one because I have an I4 Altima and it pulls like crazy for a 3k lbs 4 cylinder! I actually looked into it and there are at least two guys who have done a RWD conversion. Now I just need to find a way to put a proper rear axle into one with a Titan engine and tranny and it might just be a project worth doing!  Alternatively Nissan can just release a RWD Altima (or at least a proper V8 GTR!).
Nissan,2wcyif,Knight_of_autumn,1 point,Thu Feb 19 00:59:55 2015 UTC,The japanese auto makers have a way with small displacement motors. Even my old 3L V6 hardbody pulls dang well for a nearly 30 year old mini truck! I wouldnt mind a RWD small car. Sounds like fun! I do rather like the V6 in the GTR. I like small displacement motors using that displacement better than a larger engine that produces the same power.

Nissan,2wdg2i,raybrant,1 point,Thu Feb 19 04:49:30 2015 UTC,I'd say 150k miles is the breaking point. Not because the engine will give out but because anything rubber will start to degrade. The powertrain will last you well beyond 200k miles with barely any maintenance.  My 350Z was very good to me.

Nissan,2wc2kj,lantech19446,3,Wed Feb 18 18:11:27 2015 UTC,"I have not personally run a ""multi spark"" kit, however I would stay away from anything like that. Most if not all those type of things are a hoax. E3 plugs, pulstar etc don't actually improve anything and in many cases can cause issues with the ignition system. Just put the factory recommended NGK iridium spark plugs in it."
Nissan,2wc2kj,boostedka89,2,Wed Feb 18 19:15:22 2015 UTC,"I know they can cause issues with idle and overrev which is why I would have gone with the msd which has an external rev limiter. I kind of wondered whether the computer would eventually correct for the advantage though, it seems like these cars monitor every piece of the engine cycle so closely that it would go hmm i'm not getting the exhaust I expected and correct for it."
Nissan,2wc2kj,JakeSaint,3,Wed Feb 18 19:42:51 2015 UTC,"Aight. I'm gonna weigh in here, since modifying cars is what I do for a fuckin' living.   Do you race the altima? If the answer is yes, then what kind of racing? Do you have a turbo or supercharger?   If the answer is no, then put stock stuff in it, and stay the hell away from the msd ignition system. It has zero place in a vehicle unless it is heavily modded, or utilizes an old school distributor, which the 2.5 4banger does not."
Nissan,2wc2kj,JakeSaint,1 point,Wed Feb 18 22:18:43 2015 UTC,"definitely not racing it and most certainly is a coil system, I was hoping more for mileage improvement than power improvement the car is plenty powerful for what I need it for, any suggestions?"
Nissan,2wc2kj,JakeSaint,3,Wed Feb 18 22:26:56 2015 UTC,"Stock. Parts. Nothing else. Ngk or denso plugs, (most Nissan's like the E3 plugs too, I find, but the other two are better) and oem components otherwise."
Nissan,2wc2kj,Exolis87,2,Wed Feb 18 22:39:43 2015 UTC,"I suppose I should explain a few things too... You're not gonna get much more mileage out of it as fat as economy goes. If it's old enough to have the traditional slushbox, then it just sucks, and that's your hangup. If it's new enough for the cvt, (as I can't remember when they switched the altima) then it's a hunk of junk, and still your hangup for economy. If it's a stick, learn how to drive for economy, and you'll find the mileage. Otherwise, modding it won't do shit."
Nissan,2wc2kj,Exolis87,2,Wed Feb 18 22:42:32 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more with JakeSaint, don't mess with that kind of junk because it's never an easy plug and play without side effects. The Advertisement will say it is and it's blah blah blah.    Get new Altima, CVT is better and more efficient.  Keep tires inflated, use Fuel cleaner(I would recommend Seafoam), do Oil changes when needed, reduce weight in vehicle, replace Air Filter(or buy K&N Air Filter). Basically keep it a clean, well oiled machine and don't drive like a maniac.    Also, stuff like the E3 Spark Plugs is just hype really, their wording is ""techy"" to draw attention, example. ""As a result, the E3 DiamondFIRE ground electrode works to create a plasma channel through which the spark current flows more easily. That helps our multiple-edge configuration to outperform all other spark plug designs available, including many premium offerings from the major manufacturers."" They literary just explained how a spark works in every spark plug with a bit of finesse."

Cost of 4 tires plus changing them, cost of an oil change, etc. Then factor in the MPG and average gas prices and you're pretty well set."

Nissan,2w5xoa,jocker12,3,Tue Feb 17 17:21:28 2015 UTC,"Tires factored in greatly to the cost of ownership when I had mine.  Brakes + Transmission/fluid flushes were expensive as well.  It depends on what you are going for, too.  Work only done by the dealer, or work done independently.  These are only my numbers, other people with newer cars / different setup may have different costs.  I was getting about 8k miles out of a set of tires, and they were about 2k a set for me mounted and balanced.  12mpg city 18mpg hwy, and would run premium only due to tune.  My service cost was about $1100 for the big fluid change, I think the parts were about $800 not from Nissan (cheaper), and $250 bucks to have the shop do it. (dealer) + tax  Regular oil change wasn't bad.  Break job is a big factor as well, and those costs vary pretty wildly.  Directly from Nissan is quite expensive."

Nissan,2vvbc4,1994GTR,7,Sat Feb 14 15:43:54 2015 UTC,"were drowning in skylines here, though most of them are not GTR's.  if find it sad for US car enthusiast that you cant even import these  (and other) cars because of some ridiculous law.  You see some ridiculous shit that is allowed on the road, but a Japanese family sedan approved in the rest of the world? Noooo, no no no thats too dangerous."
Nissan,2vvbc4,Dessomnia,2,Sat Feb 14 16:22:39 2015 UTC,"The law might have been proper back when it was enacted, but these days it is more of a law that is burried and forgotten.  I would not expect many people to actually challenge the law and try to get it overturned, which is a damned shame.  The U.S. has always been a bit tight fisted on what cars are allowed into the country.  It is why we miss out on a huge chunk of the Hot Hatches that come out, for example.  But they make odd exceptions, like the Hennessey Venom GT, which is clearly more dangerous than the R33 ever was."
Nissan,2vvbc4,minizanz,2,Sat Feb 14 16:46:00 2015 UTC,"the venom gt has no exceptions that a normal car could get.  it is very limited and based on another car that is DOT legal.  the skyline problems have to go with people committing fraud to get the r32/33/34 legal, but even then the models with 250 units or less produced are legal like the blitz spec nur custom or the factory m spec nur or the ztune or most of the nismo ones as nissan made those a distinct model and not a trim."

Nissan,2vvbc4,gehzumteufel,2,Sun Feb 15 11:35:51 2015 UTC,You could just remove all the front drive running gear. This has been done many times before.

Nissan,2vvbc4,Quon-iz,5,Sat Feb 14 23:12:25 2015 UTC,twin turbo and a stronger engine.
Nissan,2vvbc4,destroyeraseimprove,1 point,Sat Feb 14 23:26:29 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty certain the RB25 NEO is a way better engine for anythingo ther than a dedicated track car. Make 600whp all day without any issues. RB26s tend to be more finnicky, people always have to upgrade oil pumps, seems to need rebuilds much more often etc"
Nissan,2vvbc4,gehzumteufel,2,Sat Feb 14 23:52:19 2015 UTC,There is a significant amount of power difference and also a displacement difference. Tuning is also different. Basically you're suggesting buying an actually inferior (by specs) car and attempting to match. When what I am suggesting is to take a badass car and to make it drive two instead of four wheels and to save weight and drive train losses which translates into an even more bonkers car.
Nissan,2vvbc4,destroyeraseimprove,3,Sun Feb 15 06:21:02 2015 UTC,"RB25DET NEO is in some ways a better engine than the RB26. Displacement is only 100ccs difference and if you want to make big power anyway you use an RB30 bottom end, so pointless differentiating them. 25 NEO has got variable cam timing, so makes more torque and power down low than the 26, N1 oil pump so oil control is better outta the box and stock bottom end is just as strong so can take as much power. 26 has a more optimised valvetrain, plus ITBs, and sounds better.. who doesn't love that shit. But in the end it's at the point where I'd rather just buy the cheaper option - cash is limited after all."
Nissan,2vvbc4,gehzumteufel,2,Sun Feb 15 06:37:05 2015 UTC,"If you're comparing stock for stock, which was my intent, you're not really making any points that matter. Apples to oranges when you compare modified engines vs an otherwise stock experience with just removing the front drive stuff."
Nissan,2vvbc4,destroyeraseimprove,3,Sun Feb 15 06:45:23 2015 UTC,"As I said there are scant differences between the two engines, with the exception of 25 NEO having VCT which is actually better if anything.   Also 25 NEO apparently was updated to have solid lifters as well.  Over here in Australia, where Skylines are pretty ubiquitous, there's generally some debate about whether one head is better than another when building an RB30, I'm not informed enough to know which one is better in reality since I drive a 180."

Nissan,2vvbc4,minizanz,3,Sat Feb 14 16:03:08 2015 UTC,"Ohhh I see. I've seen an R33 GT-R for sale on Facebook yesterday, in Virginia. The guy was asking 32K which is ridiculous. He wouldn't tell people if it was registered or not, so that was kind of sketchy"
Nissan,2vvbc4,raybrant,2,Sat Feb 14 16:08:22 2015 UTC,"Definitely possible that it's not legit, then. It's buyer beware when dealing with these babies. You really have to make sure they have the proper paperwork and that it all checks out."

Nissan,2vvbc4,halycon8,2,Sat Feb 14 16:13:06 2015 UTC,R33 models are STILL legally able to be registered IF and only IF someone goes through a registered importer and pays them to import and modify the car for US standards. R32 (some are actually elligible now due to 25yr old) and R34 models are the only ones that are unavailable due to no testing done.

Nissan,2vrfvh,RocketJohn5,2,Fri Feb 13 20:41:26 2015 UTC,"You actually bring up a valid market price argument.  I agree whole heartedly that no 370Z is worth more than $50K+.  Personally, I believe this car's chassis and drive train is way smoother and more refined than the Mustang GT.  The fact that a loaded GT is $45K USD is a crime.  What an expensive car with a junky non-modern chassis.  The 370Z to get is the Coupe and never the vert.

All in all, one of (if not) my favourite Skyline ever produced.   AUCTION SHEET  For anyone who doesn't know how to read a Japanese auction sheet, Here's a guide.   But it has 42,280 original KM's, and an auction grade of 4.5/B. The 4.5 comes from a scale that goes 1-6, R, RA, and S, with S and 6 being highest, while 1/RA/R are lowest. However, 6 and 5 are basically brand new so 4.5 is possibly the highest you could expect for a car this old. R and RA are if they were repaired or in an accident, while S is less than a year old.   The B is for the interior. Usually graded from A-E, with A being brand new. B is most common for exporting, and is always very clean. C may have a few cigarette burns, or tears in upholstery. D and E involve multiple instances of damage to the interior.   So all in all, this car is beautiful, and went for less than I expected. I was thinking around 100k CDN atleast, yet it sold for around 90k CDN."

However: This thing costs about the same as a new GTR, no?  Other than collectors' value, is there anything about it that modern cars don't have anymore?"
Nissan,2vp90y,Rus_s13,7,Thu Feb 12 23:35:19 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't compare any skilines or older GTR's to the Americanized model. They are not the same.   That being said, yes it is more of a collector's car, but 100% worth it. It's one of 44 R33 400r's that were the last off the line for R33's.   I'd compare it to a 22b Subaru STi. It doesn't have much changed from the GC8 of that time, (bodykit, more power, and no ABS.) but it had a limited production making it's prices skyrocket.   Another thing is the NISMO parts on the 400R. This comes from a time when NISMO parts added substantial amounts of power, and were race inspired. Nowadays, when I see a NISMO edition it looks like they threw a wing on a car, and that's about it. (That's my opinion though)"
Nissan,2vp90y,yelowpunk,1 point,Thu Feb 12 23:46:39 2015 UTC,"Okay, so it's more to do with the exclusivity.   I just can't imagine how much more power they had forced out of a Skyline, because they're already the bee's knees."
Nissan,2vp90y,gehzumteufel,4,Fri Feb 13 01:49:26 2015 UTC,"The 400R was very special at the time because of the gentleman's agreement in Japan for all vehicles sticking to a 276ps (HP) I think that number not be exact, but close too  That's why American supra's had more power than the JDM models"

Very few mechanical issues, probably check the timing belt (chain?) intervals and make sure either it's not overdue or due soon. ( = talk the price down)  Front CV's I've noticed on mine at 50,000ks are a bit clunky at full lock... but no worries according to my mechanic.  I've found the headlights have a tendency to degrade, and the paint is very easy to mark. The interior plastics can also be frail, and don't get put off by the gear lever, it's very very noisy.  I return approx 6.5L/100km average out of mine, running ""95 octane"" petrol, tends not to like ethanol blends, nor '91 octane' I have not noticed the difference in economy or performance using higher grade fuels, but 95 vs 91/ethanol returns me approx 100-150km per tank better especially on freeway conditions.  I will also add, that mine is a sedan, although I much prefer the shape of the hatch, it's not any good for a young family as the baby seat harness points basically block you from putting anything bigger than a shopping bag into the rear of the car, impossible with a pram. It blows me away every time we pack the sedan, the boot is huge and the cabin room is great for a small-mid sedan."

There is kind of a long procedure to get proper fluid level. But if you remove the plug from the tube you can add fluid to the transmission. I'd say put about 2.5 litres in and drive to your nearest dealer and have them adjust the fluid level. FYI the tube is kinda short and is on the front side of the transmission.

Nissan,2vdnj9,dgarci24,3,Tue Feb 10 19:30:09 2015 UTC,"I took the panel off today. That sumbitch is destroyed, the cone is completely separated from the rest of the speaker. Damn cheap paper woofers."

Nissan,2v93pw,funkypeach,6,Mon Feb 9 01:35:04 2015 UTC,GTR king of the mountain! Wish I was there...
Nissan,2v93pw,MezjE,4,Mon Feb 9 06:06:54 2015 UTC,Is this real life?
Nissan,2v93pw,opelok,5,Mon Feb 9 05:10:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, it was at the Bathurst 12hr, and was the actual car that won in the 1990s."
Nissan,2v93pw,Torched88,1 point,Mon Feb 9 05:51:56 2015 UTC,Wow I'm jealous you got to see that.
Nissan,2v93pw,WaddleWaddleMofo,2,Mon Feb 9 21:23:09 2015 UTC,"So if they marketed this as a toy and not a car... does that mean I could own this in the US? :3   Granted in 2 more years it would be 25 years old, but who can wait for an R32?"
Nissan,2v93pw,Torched88,3,Mon Feb 9 08:32:34 2015 UTC,You can get R32 GTR's in the US now. It's been 25 years for the 89 and 90 model.

Nissan,2v93pw,1994GTR,2,Tue Feb 10 17:53:22 2015 UTC,I enjoy mine
Nissan,2v93pw,timruddell125,-2,Mon Feb 9 22:16:56 2015 UTC,Just wait for the drift version.
Nissan,2vcuhi,jocker12,1 point,Mon Feb 9 23:33:31 2015 UTC,Should have just imported it as a race car and trailer-ed it with a titan to and from the track. Would have save him so much headache.

Nissan,2v8l1r,Gogomushroom,1 point,Mon Feb 9 04:00:47 2015 UTC,How is that going to fit underneath a bonnet
Nissan,2v8l1r,raybrant,1 point,Mon Feb 9 02:41:54 2015 UTC,i have the r33 crossmember in my s14 to make the rb25 sit lower in the car to clear the hood.
Nissan,2v8l1r,_n3,1 point,Mon Feb 9 04:01:39 2015 UTC,Kind of a small turbo for an RB25. What are your plans?
Nissan,2v6eya,slothonreddit,9,Sun Feb 8 08:37:29 2015 UTC,"Damn, that man can drive."
Nissan,2v6eya,turbo240,6,Sun Feb 8 15:15:55 2015 UTC,Very impressive. Not common to see a 10 car lengths victory.
Nissan,2v6eya,raybrant,1 point,Sun Feb 8 17:27:37 2015 UTC,"Considering it was a 12 hour, it was damned close."
Nissan,2v6eya,seventh_skyline,5,Tue Feb 10 07:10:40 2015 UTC,Wow it looks like at the end the GT-R was tired of keeping pace and decided to get home early
Nissan,2v6eya,mechabeast,1 point,Sun Feb 8 17:50:21 2015 UTC,"""It's been awfully fun chaps, but I think I'll actually go 100% throttle now. See you lot at the line."""
Nissan,2v6eya,timruddell125,3,Mon Feb 9 02:58:29 2015 UTC,"I watched the entire race and not once did the GT-R ever have the legs on the Bentley in a straight line like that.   You can see the Bentley has ""some"" sort of mechanical issue towards the end and I wonder how much that contributed to it.   Make no mistake, I wanted this outcome and was very happy to see the GT-R come home first, but I was a bit disappointed that it wasn't a dog fight over the mountain.   Anyone know what happened to the Bentley? Surely he didn't get that good a draft heading up the mountain? Those GT3s don't have an overboost function do they?"
Nissan,2v6eya,_ActionDan_,7,Sun Feb 8 21:15:16 2015 UTC,Actually the gtr had the fastest straight line speed of any car in the field over both speed traps. Its strength was is corner exit grip onto long straights as it was much faster there and that's exactly what you saw.  No issue with the Bentley reported.
Nissan,2v6eya,brownyR31,2,Sun Feb 8 21:51:26 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I thought the Bentley looked like it was leaking something."
Nissan,2v6eya,_ActionDan_,6,Sun Feb 8 22:02:05 2015 UTC,It had been leaking dry ice from the cool suit storage for a few hours.  Nothing to do with the car performance
Nissan,2v6eya,brownyR31,2,Sun Feb 8 22:08:02 2015 UTC,"Ahh, next time I'll try not to have a nap during the race so I don't miss these critical aspects!   Thanks for the info :)"
Nissan,2v6eya,_ActionDan_,1 point,Sun Feb 8 22:49:56 2015 UTC,"Also, the Nissan had tye freshest tyres at the end and was really getting out of the corners rapidly. I was wondering if maybe they can turn up the mixture or something in those cars, because it did grow a big black stain on the arse during the last hour."
Nissan,2v6eya,brownyR31,1 point,Mon Feb 9 07:17:19 2015 UTC,They do have a high and low boost setting. May have turned it to high boost once they realised they could make it home with fuel
Nissan,2v6eya,cjENTusBLAZE,2,Mon Feb 9 09:37:18 2015 UTC,that was remarkable stuff
Nissan,2v6eya,JohnStamosBRAH,1 point,Sun Feb 8 16:21:59 2015 UTC,I saw that Super Bowl commercial showing off the GTR racing and now this... Is the GTR just getting into the racing circuit for the first time? Or has it been racing for a while now?  Love the post though.  I'd really enjoy seeing more racing posts here!
Nissan,2v6eya,timruddell125,2,Mon Feb 9 00:59:02 2015 UTC,"First time it's won at Bathurst in 20+ years. Mind you, this is only the 2nd time it's raced there since the R32 GTR was banned in 93 IIRC."
Nissan,2v6eya,Invisible-War,1 point,Mon Feb 9 03:05:42 2015 UTC,"They race a few versions of tye GTR around the world. In Japan there is a monster V8 RWD prototype version, the new LMP1 LeMans car (not really a GTR though) and this one which is based on GT3 regs."
Nissan,2v6eya,Domonique00,1 point,Mon Feb 9 07:15:05 2015 UTC,This video might be the thing that gets me to start watching pro racing.
