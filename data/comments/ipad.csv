Web browsing, reddit, fantasy baseball, games, movies, chat, facebook, slack...  What things can't I do as efficiently on an iPad?  Writing long emails, working with Microsoft Office files (excel, word, etc)....and that's about it?  I had an old laptop that I realized one day I hadn't powered up in six weeks.  It's now boxed up and tucked away in the closet since I realized I had no use of it.  I do 100% of my home computing on my iPad or Android phone.  If I absolutely need to type up something long or work on an excel doc, I do it on my work computer.

The odd workflows and lack of file system can be somewhat overcome with cloud and web apps - but then I lumbered with browsers than doesn't support my productivity extensions and loves ads.  A mac book or MacBook Air - or think pad carbon or dell xps - now offer the instant on, the all day battery, and the size and and weight that the iPad once claimed as its own.

ipad,3e3bv2,talones,4,Tue Jul 21 20:45:24 2015 UTC,"I personally tend to use my laptop (MBP) more than my iPad these days.  I mostly use my iPad when I'm out and about and for odd apps.   I should probably add that I do a lot of development and ""heavy lifting"" that you can't really do on an iPad so tend to be on my Macbook anyway.  There's not always a point in switching.  If I am just doing a bit of casual browsing, checking my (multiple) email accounts, then I still like the iPad (but I also use my iPhone for that).  But I usually switch back to the Macbook for any long emails (more than a paragraph or 2).  There are also things where the app works a bit better than the web site too.   One thing I commented on elsewhere is I do prefer to use it in meetings. Using a tablet is much less invasive than using a laptop as it tends to sit flat on the desk or in your hand. A laptop screen can act a bit like a wall between you and the others. You don't really get that with paper or a tablet.  I use a bluetooth keyboard with my iPad and it turns it into a mini laptop/notebook, just not quite enough.  Whilst it might be heresy to say here, I can see the point of a Surface more now too.  I could probably see me switching devices less with one of those as I'd be able to more I suspect.    As to your actual question, to be honest, ""No, there is not much I do on my iPad that I can't and don't do on my iPhone"". I check email, surf and use apps there too. If my iPad broke I might not replace it and just live with MacBook and iPhone. It's sometimes nicer to have a bigger version but I suspect I'd just do without."
ipad,3e3bv2,devtastic,3,Tue Jul 21 20:01:18 2015 UTC,"I started with a desktop, laptop, and smartphone.  A few years ago I picked up an iPad3 LTE basically for a bigger screen device for media consumption and email & calender.  Fast forward and it took over for my laptop.  My laptop died a year ago and I haven't replaced it because I haven't needed it yet.  I have my old desktop for when I need to do computer stuff, but otherwise it is iPhone or iPad.  I got a bluetooth keyboard ""case"" for the iPad for travel which made it smaller and lighter than my laptop and it does what I need with a few good apps.  Plus one charger for both iPad and iPhone which is one more space/weight savings.  I still need a ""real computer"" but for me that is a desktop but for anything on the go I use the iPad."

I would guess you don't, either. For most specific use cases, a carriage pulled by horses is enough and much cheaper than a car, for example. Most of the time, a product does the same that other products does, but in a more comfortable or practical way. And that's why people buy it.  I have a laptop and an iPad. And on most tasks I ask myself why would I use a laptop. I use my iPad for everything, except web development or heavy photo editing.

And there's the apps.  Buuuut I would say if you have a laptop I would think about whether you need an iPad.

Its just such a pleasure to use and seems like the fastest way to get to information. I've actually considered going back to a dumb phone and saving some money on my cell service since my newest iPad has LTE.  Application-wise it is hard to find some specific thing that can't be done on a laptop or phone. One advantage an iPad has over a Laptop is that you can use an iPad without any issues while standing up but with a Laptop you need to be sitting or you are going to hurt your wrist.  There are some industry specific uses that are hard to accomplish on a Laptop. For example, Structure IO makes a 3d scanner for the iPad that lets you document a room while walking around with an iPad. There may be a similar ""laptop"" solution, but I suspect that it would require more expensive hardware that is wireless because moving a laptop around a room with a cable attached can be problematic."

Most of my personal use is email / web browsing / video / reading, and a tablet can handle that in spades.  However for work computing needs, an iPad is not even close. I usually have multiple PPT / Excel windows open at any given time throughout the day, plus OneNote, Wunderlist, and a Web Browser. That doesn't even include any of the custom software I need to run for work.  I will say though that while the iPad is great for personal use, nothing has yet to feel as fast to me as a PC. I can alt-tab and fly from window to window much faster on a PC than I can on a tablet. There is no ""input lag"" with the keyboard, I can use a mouse when needed, etc. All of that juts makes a true PC experience feel faster to me."

Sitting with a laptop in front of you gives an impression of being closed off and defensive in a way which is very similar to the body language of crossed arms.  The iPad, in contrast, sits flat on the table and doesn't close you off in the same way.

Back earlier this year I have the same bug that you describe and all I had to do was wait to no longer use that part of the calendar.  The current bug I  in dealing with is I cannot delete an event without the calendar crashing but fortunately that event is this monDay  so I will be over that hurdle shortly.      people complain about the stock calendar and I think it is quite justified. But my wife and I and my two children awkward date on it despite the difficulties. There are a lot of calendar apps for iOS.   for family stuff my wife uses the stock one but then has her own calendar app also. I just grin and bear it and use the stock one for everything.

I am looking to sell my current mini and my old smartphone and come as close to breaking even as possible, and that's not going to happen with the Air, The air is going to cost me around 350$ after I sell the rest of the stuff.

The issue is that major features of iOS 9—like true multitasking with two apps that are active simultaneously—will not be supported by the mini 2.  If all you're going to do on your iPad is watch movies and play a few games, it doesn't really matter what iPad you get. Then, by all means, get the mini.  What I don't understand is: if the mini is so much cheaper than it normally is, why not buy it and resell it at a price that is closer to normal but still a pretty good deal? Then save this money toward a better iPad.  For that matter, if you're really that tight on money, maybe you shouldn't be doing any spending right now?

Stupid name, weak attempt at the netbook market.  Apple does what Apple wants to do. They won't kill the iPad mini because it sells well."

For both the iPod and the iPhone, they would not be around if Apple hadn't backtracked on initial design decisions.  The complains people had with the original iPod were valid and fixed by next version.  Jobs preached web apps for the iPhone until the next version.   Apple does surveys.

I wouldn't say it got panned for being AT&T-only; I think people expected it was a business deal, and HOPED they would drop the exclusivity eventually. Yes, there was SOME disappointment- AT&T kind of sucked back then. But it was a good move for them, the money that came pouring in went right back into their infrastructure.

Steve Jobs  ""So you can’t go out and ask people, you know, what the next big thing. There’s a great quote by Henry Ford, right?

The mini is competing with the iphone 6+. Not sure what the sales figures are, but it may not make a lot of sense to keep both around. It also allows then to concentrate tablet experience on devices that are larger.   We'll see I guess. However if there was any year to skip an update in the last 3-4 years this is it."

It still feels like the Air 2 is a brand new product (nothing really challenged it except maybe the Surface 3 and the Nexus 9 got close but had too many issues at launch). Not a huge issue if the Air 3 launches say spring/summer 2016.  As more people get big phones (5.5 inches and above), surely the sales of the Mini are dropping significantly enough for Apple to consider dropping it but I guess they will give it one last chance with the Mini 4."

The article isn't saying Apple would ""drop"" the iPad Air 3; it's just saying they'd delay releasing an updated one for a year.  That's like saying they ""dropped"" the Thunderbolt display just because it hasn't been updated in a couple of years.  It's been de-prioritized, not dropped, and is due for a refresh anytime due to the advent of USB 3.  The article does suggest that they'd drop the mini, but that makes very little sense.  There's clearly a market for devices of that size, and the iPhone 6/6 Plus clearly show that Apple is paying attention to market demands for device sizes.  Why would Apple just stop producing something that meets that market need if they know their customers would begin looking at other operating systems if they couldn't find a suitable Apple product in the size they wanted?  This would potentially lead to those same customers reconsidering their phone/computer/watch choices as well.  This isn't a scenario Apple would want to encourage.

They make sense for the fixed displays embedded in plastic, but for something portable, it's hard to beat the mini.  If they do drop the mini, I'm not sure if I'd buy another full sized model."

It's really time for people to stop arguing over ""better"" and settle on ""different.""  An iPhone 6 is not ""better"" than a Galaxy S6, LG G4, Nexus 6, or other android flagships; they're just different devices for people who want a different experience while taking a different route to the same destination.

They're just not built into the OS like in the Fire devices. Only ""disadvantage"" is that you can't borrow a book from the Kindle store as you would if you had a kindle. I forget how that's capped, but it wasn't like you could freely borrow them unless you pay extra for that service, and then it doesn't matter since that works on the iOS app.  You can get the Kindle app. I'm guessing it works about the same as the Fire one. Then you have plenty of e-readers that, only with the exception of iBooks, are available on android as well. I'd go for the mini. Less bulky to carry in your bag. The full size is nice, I love mine, but it's too uncomfortable to hold for extended periods of time. Cases help, but it still takes a great portion of your lap. If I traveled/commuted enough I'd switch, but I work from home, so it's not a big deal.    The major advantage that iOS has over the Fire I'd say is simply a better app library. That and iPads age very well. My brother has the first iPad that came with retina (2012, I think) and has no complaints."

I'm pretty sure it's similar.   The Kindle app for iOS doesn't have a built in way to buy or download books from Amazon. However, Amazon has a really nice mobile store that I just bookmark to my home screen. So, there are two icons: One for reading content I have sent to my iPad (Blue - Kindle App) and one for buying/checking-out books and sending them to the Kindle for iPad app (Orange - Mobile Amazon website).

I like having a book available on all devices.  Of those 3 devices I find the Nexus 7 the best size so you're probably best with a mini as it's a similar size.  It's not that an iPad is really too big, but 7"" just works better somehow.  I thinks it the one hand thing.  One PS, I still use iBooks on my iPad/iPhone to read PDFs as I've never really figured out an easy way to get PDFs into the Kindle app.  It is possible but I've found it easier to use iBooks or whatever the Android PDF reader is.  You can do it in iTunes with a bit of fiddling or via email using the Kindle Personal Documents Service, I've just never tried."

Lipo's hate extremes for extended periods of time - low voltage is not such an issue as the iPad will turn off long before it reaches low enough voltage to cause permanent damage. High voltages though will definitely age the battery at an accelerated rate and reduce capacity over time. An example would mean keeping it plugged in every night and not using a significant amount of capacity resulting in high average battery voltage over time.  So, use the device and its battery capacity and don't keep it topped off constantly."

Go back to using my old iPhone 4 from 2010, jump to android, use a Lumia 920 that I have laying around, go to iPhone 6, or wait 3 months til the next set of iPhones. I watched a video on youtube that came out about a year ago stating how the device was still functional and what would be missing. Wasn't a great video, but it showed that it was possible to live with it. If I hadn't found the video, I might not have thought to really give the phone a chance. My first thoughts were no way. So you making the video might be helpful to a number of people. Specifically, I think new System Admins might like knowing what can be done with the company/school's large batch of aging iPad 2 units."

I don't use my phone as much as I used to because I can't stand waiting 10 seconds for basic things to load. But I would hate to be without iMessaging, Dark Sky, and Fantasical for three months.

Most are former pc games adapted to ipad but that's what makes them great; they aren't just stupid ""mobile"" games.  That's the thing, a lot of very successful indy games end up getting ported to the ipad after their success on PC. Some of which end up being more suited for portable/tablet gaming. That doesn't happen with android so you're stuck with ipad hand-me-downs.  EDIT: Also, I wouldn't get an ipad 2, that tech is old.

ipad,3d91mr,TA-93,3,Tue Jul 14 23:54:08 2015 UTC,Indie PC games are coming to iPad in a big way.  From the games I care about:  Available: FTL Papers Please Don't Starve Hearthstone (obviously not indie) Fallout Shelter (also not indie) Implosion is quite good  Soon:  Prison Architect  This is mostly what I play on iPad. The controls are ideal with all of these games or intuitive enough and they each can keep my attention for many hours. Without them my iPad would be used much less.
ipad,3d91mr,focfer77,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:59:17 2015 UTC,I'll definitely try some of those out. Is the performance super fluid or what?
ipad,3d91mr,TA-93,2,Tue Jul 14 15:12:49 2015 UTC,"Yes. Most of them feel designed for iPad first, even though they aren't. I feel FTL is actually superior on iPad, for instance. Papers Please as well. Don't Starve is smooth 99% of the time, but skips when it's auto saving (it does this on PC too). Prison Architect isn't available yet, so I can't comment on that. It also happens to be a considerably more complex game than the others so I don't know honestly.   Hearthstone was built for iPad first. That's the thing with iPad games and apps, lots of them are custom built for iPad and then ported elsewhere. It shows too. When I'm playing Hearthstone it feels like it's a purpose built Hearthstone machine. When I'm playing FTL I feel the same way. It's amazing how smooth it really is. With games on iPad, if they get the controls right the machine fades away."

ipad,3cwbcj,fatalexe,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:25:47 2015 UTC,I got a launch day Surface Pro 1 and have had my whole life in OneNote since a tablet PC replaced my Newton message pad.  OneNote on the iPad syncs over OneDrive so I can reference my notes easily when I'm out and about or the old surface runs out of power.  They even added stylus support to the iPad app so when I need to I can jot something down quick.  Now I'm tempted to pick up the Pencil stylus for the iPad. . .
ipad,3cwbcj,GentlemanJorge,2,Wed Jul 15 14:57:00 2015 UTC,Just an editing note... Your TL;DR states 'Goodreads' versus 'GoodNotes'.  Thanks for the write up.
ipad,3cwbcj,dysteleological,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:42:40 2015 UTC,"I use Noteshelf and Notability extensively. Also have used Penultimate, GoodNotes, Bamboo and several others.   For me, the killer feature in Notability is that it has an iPhone app too, and notes sync seamlessly. That makes Notability my notebook app of choice.   That said, I like Noteshelf for its slightly better smoothness in handwriting, it's notebook organization (like a book shelf), and the way it handles PNG imports as transparent images that allow you to use the graphics like bullets or other diagramming.   Honestly, if Noteshelf had an iPhone app, I could consider using it as my primary note taking tool... But the iPhone app is just too nice to give up. I don't carry my iPad everywhere but I always have my phone with me. Also, I agree that landscape mode is a bit annoying in Noteshelf.   Bottom line: Notability is the one for me."
ipad,3cwbcj,davemee,3,Sat Jul 11 16:28:54 2015 UTC,"Notability also has a dirt-cheap Mac app, so you can add stuff to your notes that makes more sense with a full windowing OS, and sync it back to your iDevices seamlessly.   The iPad/iPhone version is universal as well, so you only pay once. /satisfied Notability user."

ipad,3cwbcj,disambiguated,2,Sun Jul 12 17:49:58 2015 UTC,The plastic disk styli are always going to be much more precise so its great for writing tiny and the tip  on these is notgiing to be nearly as fine than on the plastic disk.  However these styluses are extremely accurate and because its more fine than a regular stylus you can comfortably  write pretty small.

I suppose that you're talking about bluetooth pencils when you write ""you have to manually slide down the bar as you write "". If you use no-bluetooth pencils, it's works fine, and automatically."
ipad,3cwbcj,disambiguated,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:52:20 2015 UTC,"So no that's not quite right. How it used to work was that Bluetooth pencils were the only way you could get automatic palm rejection and if you used a regular stylus you had to manually slide down the bar as you write. However now here are new updates to notability and good notes which also have automatic palm rejection for even regular styluses, so because of that I don't think there is a need for Bluetooth pencils for writing anymore. Hopefully that clarifies a bit and you are welcome!"
ipad,3cwkub,trukmec,10,Sat Jul 11 11:45:52 2015 UTC,"The reason tabs reload is memory. When the iPad is short on memory, Safari start throwing away background tabs to return memory to the system.  Pages use more and more memory over the years. Ads in particular have been putting a tremendous amount of pressure on memory, sometime using hundred of megabytes. That problem is getting worse really fast, every year, the average memory footprint of web pages increases.  The reason it is possible to keep more tabs into memory is the relentless work of a few engineers to reduce the memory usage of web pages. WebKit is a lot more aggressive about returning memory to the system. Some memory leaks have also been discovered, hunted, and destroyed. When switching tabs, WebKit does better job at clearing everything that can be restored for the tab going in the background.  A lot of it has been thanks the work of Andreas Kling. He has worked days and nights to improve memory efficiency. If you are interested, he explained some of the problems on his twitter account."

BTW I also have an air1.  P.S - if you are using an ad locker for safari,something like purefy, then it could explain the less ram usage, cuz it blocks all the useless ad JavaScript from running making websites very less resource intensive.

ipad,3cxr0v,Opie045,3,Sat Jul 11 20:47:49 2015 UTC,"I think, to be safe, get the 64 gb. The rationale is, you will probably want to keep the iPad for as long as possible, and the best way to future proof it is by giving yourself as much space as you can reasonably afford.   Your situation may change in a year or two, and may need the extra storage. Unless you buy a new model iPad, every year, invest an extra $100 for the higher space, you won't regret it"

If you are going to avoid storing movies on the device and if you are not going to get into games, then 16GB would likely work. Podcasts shouldn't take much room but you might not be able to keep many on it at same time, 5-10 should be fine but don't plan on keeping 50 on it at same time, unless podcasts are the only thing on it.   A lot of apps are fairly small with space but a few are noticeable.

ipad,3ctg03,DonHopkins,3,Fri Jul 10 17:10:45 2015 UTC,"David Levitt and I are very happy to have our multi player AR/VR Pantomime Playground ready to beta test on iOS, and we would love for redditors to play with it for free!  http://PantomimeCorp.com  The revolutionary Pantomime™ software platform turns any tablet, smart phone or computer into a portal into shared virtual worlds — headgear optional.  Pantomime lets any mobile user visit shared worlds, reach in, and interact, lifting the key barriers to mass adoption of VR by consumers: easy access, reaching in, sharing, and mobility.  You can sign up to beta test it on iOS 8 or higher here: http://pantomimecorp.com/contact-us/  I'd be glad to answer any questions you have about it!  Here is the Help and Quick Start Guide.  Here are some demo videos: https://vimeo.com/pantomimecorp/videos  Pantomime Playground Overview  Pantomime Playground includes several fun scenes -- from realistic dominos you can line up and knock over, to fun with gravity, bowling pins and balls, and a dozen other kinds of virtual objects you can play with on your tablet or phone. It runs on any iPad, iPhone or Mac, and most Windows PCs.  Pantomime Technology  Pantomime™ software immerses tablets, phones and computers in virtual worlds - as if they were balanced on a virtual table and their screens were made of glass. You, and everyone else in the virtual world, can see your devices and your nimble, animated hands moving them.  With your tablet or phone you can Walk and Tumble across the table, Skate and Spin though worlds with screen gestures, Throw objects by tapping, and Paddle by gripping the screen with your thumb.  Easy, Networked, Socially Empowered Experiences: 2 Players on 5 Screens  The most disruptive thing about Pantomime is the way it makes virtual reality socially empowering, while so many headset based VR systems can be isolating and socially impairing.  This video shows two people easily playing in the same virtual world and sharing in many ways at once.  For one thing, they can look at the same screens together, see over each  others' shoulders, and make eye contact - abilities we take for granted in ordinary reality that are usually impossible in headset-based virtual reality.  Every device around them is also part of a shared virtual world.  Any user can Teleport into a shared world hosted by another device or another user.  They see their  devices and their nimble virtual hands as they interact. Each player is holding a tablet, amid common desktop and laptop computers.  Each additional computer in the scene adds another point of view and effectively widens our view into it.  With a glance users choose whether to look at a shared screen, or see a first person view through the screen in their hand.  They move and interact in many natural ways, whether physically turning around, navigating with gestures on the screen, Throwing objects from the device they're holding by tapping its screen, or swinging an iPad like a paddle to  fling objects through the scene."

Depends if you prefer android or iOS..If you want light browsing,reddit YouTube and Netflix, mini 2 is great. But as a productivity tool for college, taking notes etc... The air 2 kills the nexus, especially with the upcoming multitasking for iPad.  Best option is to wait for the prices to go down,as the launch is just ahead for new iPads and older ones get cheaper...and get the air2. Pair it up with a keyboard case and you get a mean productivity machine on the go.. But if you r in too much of a hurry or don't like the large form factor of the air2, go for the mini 2 right away.

ipad,3cs63d,Brawldud,2,Fri Jul 10 14:44:04 2015 UTC,"Depends on the kind of phone you have, as well as the kind of PC, and on your definition of ""work together."" Apple devices work together very well, but you will have to refine your criteria if you are using an android smartphone or a windows computer. Windows has iTunes (even though it is kind of crap on windows), iCloud photo stream, and most apps will sync with the corresponding website you use on a desktop.  Android, the most you can hope for as far as syncing with your iPad is concerned is the kind of continuity you can get across Google products, and maybe (maybe) you can use Beats music streaming on both of them.

ipad,3cp6x0,nickerbocker007,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:31:38 2015 UTC,"Issues on my iPad Air 2:   ""Require Passcode"" setting is set to 4 hours but behavior is immediate. My Touch ID is off, so I don't know what gives. Really annoying as I don't like entering my passcode every time. I might just turn on Touch ID if I can't find a solution -- or go back to iOS 8 for the time being. Sometimes when I swipe to unlock where there should be a passcode is instead a blank screen with just my wall paper and the status bar. Had an issue with Day One (an app) where the UI would be unresponsive when I saved an entry. Performance is kinda laggy at spots for me, especially in regards to the keyboard. Keyboard icons (undo/redo/paste) need some work I think. They just don't gel with the rest of the UI for some reason.   Thoughts:   The new keyboard, with lowercase and uppercase letters, on the iPad is incredibly useful. The shift key for me has been a problem since iOS 7 and I am so glad it was addressed in 9. PIP is really awesome. I've just messed with it through the Videos app and I really like how it automatically goes into PIP mode if a video is playing and you switch apps. Really nice. I'm not sure if FaceTime is supported yet, but I hope that it will be because I see myself using that with FaceTime. The multi-app (split) view interface is really nice. I like it. It works like you think it would/should. Can't wait until more apps are supported with PIP and this. I like the direction of Task Switcher. It never made sense to me that the previous items extended to the right where as everything else ""going back"" is a swipe to the left. So now the task switcher goes in a more natural direction and the multitouch gestures to switch apps is corrected to be consistent with the task switcher. That being said, the new Task Switcher feels clunky next to the iOS 8 one. I just felt like I could flip through things faster on the iOS 8 one and in the new one it seems like more animation eye candy that takes the place of practical."

So I'm interested in this thread as well, but in the meantime, I've been using these apps the most:   Spotify (iPad) I recommend because it's different than the mobile version since you can play individual songs instead of just shuffle (so basically like the desktop version)  Crunchy roll is good if you're into anime. If not, Netflix is worth the $8 a month and the mini makes a nice little TV. Hoopla is awesome for borrowing e-books (in addition to pretty much every other kind of media) from your local library. Frugal! Glow Hockey (free) One of the fun things about having a tablet is being able to play glow hockey on a big screen. It wouldn't have made this list without the wonderful multiplayer aspect. Download now, play with a friend when you're waiting somewhere. DayOne or GridDiary are my favorite journaling apps. Make sure you have a decent keyboard though. The ESV Bible app has probably the best design (not a bad translation either) out of the Bible apps. Highly recommend reading the Bible though, regardless of app or personal credo. Just a tip, you can download using the default iBooks app a lot of public domain classic books.   Veteran iPad users: I'm looking for a good text editor that is cloud based. Google Docs won't let me select blocks of text and the Notes app isn't easy to access from PC. So looking for recommendations there. Also considering purchasing Procreate. Worth it?"

But it is very easy to access from a PC. As for text editors being cloud based, does that mean it can only exist in the cloud? Or just that you want to create something and then upload it?  I use some combination of Pages and Word, but the docs are all saved to my Onedrive.  I've also messed around with just doing everything in a web browser on my Onedrive (Word online).  I will say that I much prefer quick notes in the Notes application and then more text centric stuff in either Pages or Word, then upload."

ipad,3ckukx,drgreenstumor,2,Wed Jul 8 23:08:24 2015 UTC,"Some apps will never interrupt background audio. Some will let you re-enable background audio by swiping up the controls from the bottom. Some will always interrupt background audio. Unfortunately you have no control over this behavior, but if you haven't already you can at least try the second method."

ipad,3ck1c2,ChrisF79,6,Wed Jul 8 14:51:25 2015 UTC,"Basically any stylus with a microfiber tip is' a good choice! (like this one)  An active stylus is imo not that great for writing, because of the way they handle quick movement. I would also avoid any stylus with a rubber tip because they tend to stick to the display and it's not very comfortable writing with it ;) So this leaves us with those microfiber tip ones. I have used them for over two years now and I can't complain! And even though I switch between two, there's no sign of them needing to be replaced! Hope that helps!"
ipad,3ck1c2,Steph4869,3,Wed Jul 8 15:14:22 2015 UTC,"When I was handwriting notes - I used apps that had a zoom function like Notetaker HD, UPAD, or Notes Plus.  Notes Plus has a setting for the Adonit Jot Touch which works well.  I bought the iFaraday 3 pack to try out different tips.  I like the reactiveness but it still has the big tip. http://www.ifaraday.com/artist.html  I tried the various Adonits and I like the one with the discs best.  Feels the most like a ballpoint pen.  I don't have the script - I bought the Jot Touch.  I think it is OK - but I find myself choosing the disc type Adonit for most apps other than Notes Plus as mentioned above.  My favorite as far as reactiveness goes is the Maglus  http://maglusstylus.com/?utm_campaign=main_endor&utm_medium=endor&utm_source=php_rand But I have a hard time recommending it.  I have a tip that is highly reactive.  Better than any I've found.  Still large but the reactiveness makes up for it.  That being said I bought the microfiber tips and a few more rubber tips - and the consistency isn't there.  Most of the replacement tips weren't as reactive as the original tip I got - so I'm not sure if they changed something.    Most of the time now - I have a bluetooth keyboard and type my notes into OneNote on my iPad.  If I need to draw something I'll grab a stylus - but I've shifted my note taking to keyboard as it is the most accurate."

ipad,3ckzyk,mrm4rc1,3,Wed Jul 8 18:55:43 2015 UTC,"I'm always weary of things labeled as ""self improvement"" because a lot of it is garbage and a fair amount of it is gateways to pyramid schemes and scams. But there are a lot of education and productivity apps on iPad that will make you more well rounded and educated.   One of the first decisions I had to make when getting my iPad was finding an app to organize my writings and ideas. Initially I used the ""notes"" app and I had a pretty decent system for a while. But the lack of organization made me seek something else out. Ultimately I picked Evernote and it's been mostly great. Another contender I tried using was google docs and I probably would have been better off using Google docs honestly but now it would be a pain to switch. It's just that one month I had to pay for premium because I was uploading a lot of video and pictures. Usually I easily fall well below the gigabyte a month that you get. So not a huge deal.   I found another app called Paprika for organizing recipes that I really liked too.   For reading I absolutely love my tablets and I'd rather read something on a tablet than read it on paper. But if you're talking about an actual book I prefer E-ink over a colored screen. Luckily there is a nook app for iPad so I can look at my books easily on either device. Also after some initial problems with Apple playing nice I think you can install almost any bookstore on your iPad so cross connectivity isn't a real issue.   I've found that iTunesU is a good educational app and sometimes I use the lectures to put me to sleep ha ha. Also khan academy is good too. I don't know if it's an app or just the website but duo lingo is good and free for language learning.   And this is more in the ""use everyday"" category and less about productivity but I use spotify so much i put it on the menu button.   Also I prefer the gmail app over the built in mail app.   If you're in the medical field and need CUs the mediscape app is fair but I've actually had an easier time just using their website on my iPad instead of the app because the search and sort is easier.   WunderMap is my favorite weather app but I've also been looking to buy the DarkSkies app when I get into an app buying mood.   And I never liked the way the calendar app on the iPhone looked so I got an app called awesome Calendar. It's pretty good and meets my needs. If I only had to access my calendar on the iPad I wouldn't even need this app but the calendar on the iPhone sucks and since I use awesome calendar on my iPhone I use it on my iPad too."

I have the Premium account so I can sync a bit more, but the best part is the 'Clip to *Evernote' Chrome widget, which lets me save a web page straight to my Evernote in whatever notebook I want, and allows me to search the content of the page through Evernote later if I'm looking for other ideas (basically 1upping standard bookmarks) *Pinterest - as a designer, Pinterest is a must for inspiration of any kind - product design, typography, illustrations, anything"

Keyboard doesn't detach. would be handy to eliminate some weight when. You know you aren't Going to be typing. The ""book mode"" where you flip the iPad around so that the keyboard is facing out behind it is awkward to hold and it's easier to just slide the keyboard off and set it aside. A minor annoyance in having to attach and reattach the keyboard part to switch between tablet and keyboard modes. I just found this out recently, but my studio headphones will not fit into the headphone port with the case on, as the headphone's got a thick protective screw around the input. This might just be those particular headphones, or be an issue with all cases. It's fine if you're using earbuds and such, but just thought I'd mention it.   Pros:   Keyboard is great. Very easy to type on, great spacing, has a backlight with three settings of brightness, and can connect to two devices at once. Keyboard automatically detects when the iPad is on the magnets, so that the keyboard only connects and turns on when it knows it is going to be used. Don't have to worry about turning it on and off , and the onscreen keyboard hides and comes back when the physical isn't in use. I've typed this whole post on it with no issues! It's very light and thin. You can definitely feel the added weight but it doesn't feel heavy, which is really great considering the sturdiness of the case and the quality of the keyboard. I didn't go for the otter box or something similar because they are far too thick for my liking.  Back case can be used with the Smart Cover, so if you have one you can just slap it on and leave the keyboard off to eliminate the aforementioned con. That would mean shelling out more dough though.     Looks great. The keyboard is aluminum, and the back part of the case is faux leather. It's nice to have a case that doesn't detract from the form factor/style of the device itself. Supposedly the battery for the keyboard lasts a year on a single charge. Can't attest to that fact yet, personally though.   Overall, I'm quite happy with it. The only true downsides for me are the non-detachable keyboard, but it's still so light that it's not an issue, and the crappy book-mode-- meaning constant removal and reattachment of the iPad if you switch back and forth a lot. Also not a big deal, since it's so easy to attach and remove the device from the keyboard apparatus."

This will stop any messages (SMS and iMessages) going to the iPad, this will also in turn remove the recently contacted.   From your phone turn off Text message forwarding on your phone to make sure that no text messages make it to your computer.  also turn off iPhone Cellular calls under the facetime so that other devices can't make/answer phone calls when the 2 devices are on the same wifi.  For contacts you can turn off contact sync on your iPad, but this means that you would have to create any new contacts you want to use from your iPad for email etc. on all your devices.  With the above items turned off I would think that having the contacts sync'd between devices wouldn't be too bad."

He doesn't Reddit so I thought I would attempt to find a solution here for him.   If it's only 50 Euros for a screen replacement, then there's no issue. That's definitely affordable, even with the otterbox thrown in. For some reason he seems to think it's going to be running him 600 Euros, but perhaps that's the companies policy on entirely busted iPads, which need a total replacement and not just a new screen.  I should be safe and suggest he goes to an Apple repair place, correct? Or do the run of the mill repair places do just as good a job?"

If you take it to Apple, they'll look it up and will likely see that it belongs to the company. They may still work with it, they may not.  If they replace it with a refurb, that could cause issues.   The serial number won't match The company won't be able to easily prove ownership. I.e., if Activation Lock ever kicks in, they likely won't be able to contact Apple and have it removed because they won't be able to prove ownership.  I can begin the activation lock removal process in about 5 minutes by contacting Apple, giving them the serial number, and confirming some company info.   Fyi, if Activation lock is on and I can't remove it, the iPad is completely useless. (Though, there are unofficial ways around activation lock).   If the company is using an MDM or Apple Configurator, they won't be able to do anything with the device. Your husband May lose access to important work apps, documents, or email.  The company could lose licenses for paid apps if they were installed with Configurator. If they're using Apple DEP, the device will need to be removed from the company's DEP account (which means they need to know it was replaced).  They'll also need to add the new device. The company may have third-party insurance on the device.  This would be covered under the insurance policy we have on a good number of our devices.  I.e., it has already been paid for and would cost $0 for me to have it repaired.   He should just own it and handle it through work where it can be handled properly.  If somebody comes to me with a damaged iPad, I can handle it.  It can be a little annoying, but I expect it to an extent.  It would really piss me off if somebody tried to get around it by having it replaced (which would cause me many more issues and time in the long run).  When I say it would piss me off, I mean I would take it up with the person's supervisor.  If he can have the screen replaced, that's better than replacing it with a refurb from Apple in the context I'm speaking to, but there is the risk that the repair shop doesn't get it repaired properly or screws it up further.  In most places, there is some sort of employee equipment agreement.  Did your husband ever sign anything saying he'd have to pay for it if he broke it or anything like that?  For us, it's assigned work equipment. We expect some to break occasionally. The employee is not docked or anything other than maybe a ""be careful.""  If it happens multiple times, we probably just not give them another. Or they would get a really old one.  He should take it to somebody at work. He can offer to pay to have it repaired if it's an issue."
ipad,3c7yq9,mooters01,2,Mon Jul 6 01:47:12 2015 UTC,Theres an unofficial way around the activation lock?
ipad,3c7yq9,sin-eater82,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:08:22 2015 UTC,"Indeed.  I don't want to explain it really and give people ideas, but it's not too difficult if you search Google and can follow specific technical instructions.  The short of it is that in order for the iPad to know to go into activation lock after it's been reset, it has to communicate with Apple servers at a specific point in the set up and be ""told"" as much.  If that doesn't happen, no activation lock."
ipad,3c7yq9,DenMikers,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:35:46 2015 UTC,"I would ask the one responsible for the iPads and technology at the company what the best course of action would. Maybe they would like to have the screen officially replaced by Apple (keeping their warranty) instead of going to a third-party.  Also, do not be cheap about this. In my experience cheap reparations are more expensive in the long run.  Going to a third-party has never, I repeat never, worked out for me regarding screen replacements.  TL;DR: Ask the company for advise. It's their iPad."

ipad,3bzvl4,Docster87,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:05:57 2015 UTC,If it is doing what you want or need it to do then I wouldn't be in a rush to upgrade. When I sold my mini1 to buy a mini2 the biggest draw for me was going from 32GB to 64GB of storage. My next iPad will likely be 128GB but I do not have any plans on when that might be.   I used my iPhone 1 for three years and then used my iPhone 4 for three more years. What I learned is the longer you wait the better the upgrade feels. Each year Apple sweetens these devices so the longer you wait between models the more new features you get. If you went out today and bought an Air 2 then that's sweet but in a few months the Air 3 will be released and it'll have at least one goodie that the Air 2 lacks.

ipad,3bvfmc,mdnns,2,Thu Jul 2 22:19:09 2015 UTC,"With an iPhone you can receive SMS on your iPad. Without an iPhone, iMessages are less useful and can sometimes confuse recipients with iPhones that end up sending you iMessages that you never will get on your Android Phone.  However, once you have iMessages on both your phone and tablet you may find it more useful. I certainly appreciate the higher quality images and the much reduced lag. SMS fits right in when talking to someone who isn't on an iOS device, so it is very seamless.  Not sure, but I think PuchBullet more-or-less fills this gap between iPad and Anroid.  Almost every iPad <-> Android phone syncing function I can think of can be accomplished with 3rd party iOS and/or Android apps. The difference really comes down to the zero-hassle setup Apple provides. You log in to your iCloud Account and its everything as oppose to a haugepauge of apps.  Edit: I haven't really found Handoff features all that useful, but I do like iCloud tabs in safari. I'm just not in situations where I'm using an App and want to transition to using the app on another device (and I have it working between Mac, iPad, and iPhone). Sending information, links, and files via PushBullet feels more seamless to me."

ipad,3bws1s,Docster87,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:47:00 2015 UTC,"It's not that the split view is worth the money.  It's the fact that if this is the only one Apple is going to give these features, it's the one that's probably going to withstand the test of time best out of all of the current iPads on the market.  I want one that's going to last me several years.  I'm not into this ""buy the new release the day it comes out"" crap."
ipad,3bws1s,N776AU,2,Fri Jul 3 13:46:16 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm certainly hoping to get at least a few years out of my Air 2... I could have gotten more out of my iPad 3 but it all starts with an itch.  Make your decision based on the screen size that suits you. Might want to wait for the new models that will likely come out later this year, but there will always be something new around the corner."
ipad,3bws1s,Gamer_Chase,0,Fri Jul 3 14:40:24 2015 UTC,"And yet you need the very newest one to feel comfortable for several years? Yes, the Air 2 has twice the RAM as all other iPads currently for sell - but I'm figuring that with the next release of iPhones and iPads they will all have 2GB of RAM. But what will that mean? My iPad mini 2 won't suddenly choke. This bump for now just means running split screen - something I'm not that excited about. I do one thing at a time as it is, if I need to multitask I'll grab my MacBook Air. It will take years before apps (other than games) to require that extra RAM. So any iPad should last the average user years, not just the Air2.   iOS 9 is being designed to run smoother on older devices. Why would Apple do that if devices with only 1GB are doomed anyway? Those devices are not doomed at all and will be fine for years and the typical person will want to upgrade for other features anyway. Every year Apple sweetens the devices so even with an iPad Air 2, the iPad Air 5 will make it feel old and that's just a little more than two years away.  So there really isn't a sweet spot. If you need to always do the newest things you will always need the newest device. Any device will feel old in a few years.   I kept my iPhone 1 for three years and upgraded mainly due to the battery failing. I kept my iPhone 4 for three years and upgraded since I could trade it in for an iPhone 5. I've had my 5 for almost two years and it is doing fine. I'm a tad concerned about it being 32-bit, but due to Touch ID and NFC and the always improving camera, I'm thinking being 32-bit won't hurt me a bit since I'll upgrade anyway either this summer or next due to all the other features I've lived without that Apple has slowly been adding."
ipad,3bupmz,ItsDarts,3,Thu Jul 2 08:34:34 2015 UTC,"I can't speak to performance in Dallas, but I just switched my phone plan from T-Mobile to AT&amp;T after a year of T-Mobile use mostly in San Antonio, with a few trips to Houston and Austin.   Speed was never my problem with T-Mobile. When I got a good signal, speed was great. The problem was getting a good signal. T-Mobile's coverage isn't as good as AT&T's, and its signal doesn't penetrate buildings as well. I'd lose signal in certain parts of town or inside of buildings where AT&T service worked just fine, and it got frustrating enough that I decided to pay the extra to get AT&T.   If you can live with the occasional gap in coverage and weaker signals indoors - which might be less of an issue to you since this is a tablet and not a phone - then give T-Mobile a shot. You can always change later, right?  EDIT: Mistakenly said ""Dallas"" instead of ""Austin."" Also, if you travel, T-Mobile's interstate coverage is improving but is still not as good as AT&T or Verizon. I'd drop off to EDGE or nothing at all in several spots on I-10 between Houston and SA."
ipad,3bupmz,BlottoOtter,2,Thu Jul 2 14:58:18 2015 UTC,"I feel like that the overall experience with TMobile is blazing fast LTE, Edge, or no service. I like that TMobile has invested a lot in making their LTE really fast but I would really appreciate it if TMobile would improve their network coverage."
ipad,3bupmz,mgweatherman08,2,Thu Jul 2 21:06:55 2015 UTC,"T-Mobile's pricing is so much more aggressive than AT&T. Getting a T-Mobile SIM just for the 200MB/month free is advised even if you do end up primarily using AT&T.   I'm sorry, I only have experience at the Dallas/Fort Worth air port. T-Mobile is always stellar right at air ports. I recommend trying T-Mobile out and seeing if it works for you. Honestly, with T-Mobile you'll probably spend a lot less. They have awesome promotional offers like 5GB for 5 months for $10. So each month I get my 200MB free from T-Mobile, and once I finish that it starts dipping into whatever I have left of my 5GB.  Edit: Something else to consider -- The Apple SIM that comes with the Air 2 will be locked to AT&T if you go with AT&T. If you go with T-Mobile or Sprint, you can switch between those two providers but once you select either of them you cannot use AT&T. Getting a new Apple SIM or a SIM from any of those providers is trivial. I have found that some providers will VOID a SIM if there is no active plan assigned to that SIM for over a month (StraightTalk is like this). Kind of a pain to have to keep ordering new SIMs if you use the data on your iPad in an A la carte fashion.   I can buy A la carte data from Sprint or T-Mobile using Apple SIM. I just open my available plans, select the one I want to use and it switches to it. Its pretty amazing and something I wish AT&T would get on board for so that when I'm in ""their"" areas, I can use them seamlessly without swapping SIM cards.  Edit 2: Might want to consider StraightTalk's tablet service. The one that is on AT&T towers (just select the AT&T SIM option when ordering one if you go that route). Its cheaper but I think they disable tethering/hot spot hosting."

ipad,3bupmz,1arebeast2,0,Thu Jul 2 18:16:12 2015 UTC,Tether your phone to iPad so you don't have an extra bill each month.
ipad,3bupmz,rancid_squirts,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:03:04 2015 UTC,"This may be a great solution for folks with unlimited plans and service providers that don't charge extra for tethering or your iPhone is jailbroken.  Advantages of having separate services   1. Battery life of phone is important to you and you are on tablet a lot. 2. Tends to be faster directly to tablet instead of routed through phone (in my experience.) 3. Tablet data plans are dirt cheap. 200MB/month free on T-Mobile. In the 6 months I've had my LTE iPad, I've spent $20 on data. First $10 was for promotional 5 GB for 5 Months. Second was the same promotional that was just offered to me again. Not sure, but I think they offer it every 5 months. If I wanted to enable tethering on an AT&T iPhone (for example), it would cost me $30/mo AND eat into my data allowance."

Recommend that he wright down account information. Also worth setting up the Apple ID/iCloud account without using an existing email address to preventing future confusion.   Buy him AppleCare+ as well. With the limited info here I'm guessing you won't have a lot of time to follow up with his progress or answer all his question. AppleCare+ will allow him to make unlimited calls to Apple Support and they can walk anyone through just about everything. Encourage him to call them when he needs help.   All that being said, are you sure he wouldn't be better off with a fully featured computer? What programs will he need to use?"

I would like to see some features added but overall it is the most reliable and solid app. I use it with a standard touch pen, never thought about buying an expensive Bluetooth pen, but eventually I will.

The tip gets less “fluid” after about 3 weeks, but it’s so cheap that I just buy another every time.  Of course there is a “learning curve” in writing on glass with a thick tip, but as you see I got used to it, pretty fast.

ipad,3bkosq,GhrisWin,10,Tue Jun 30 00:30:45 2015 UTC,"Don't freak out, you did the right thing turning it all the way off.  Do you think it just got in the charge port, or was it also the buttons and switches?  The green stuff is not battery acid. It is the chipotle sauce, possibly ionized by current at the charge port and salt in the sauce caused some copper ion migration (the bright green). This is not terrific, but if the sauce only got in the charge port it might not be fatal. It can be cleaned.  It won't get worse if it stays off, but the sauce will get harder to clean the longer it stays there and dries.  You should get some 99% isopropyl alcohol and some wood toothpicks and tissues. Fold up the tissues like a skinny Q-Tip that will fit in the charge port, but first dip it in the alcohol. Scrub in there until any dirt and green is all gone. The alcohol will evaporate in a few minutes, or blow dry air to speed this up.  These things are pretty useful for cleaning small stuff out like this, and can be found at Walgreens etc.  If you think the sauce got deep inside then it may need disassembly and cleaning. Skilled repair shop can do this but it's super important to keep it fully powered off until then-turning it on and getting to the point of random shutdowns or corrupt screen etc is almost always unrecoverable without new logic board."
ipad,3bkosq,scubascratch,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:03:14 2015 UTC,"From what I saw, the sauce was primarily on the port for charging and possibly a little on the home button but it didn't appear to seep through as it wasn't sticky. I did power it on about an hour ago though as I needed my notes. It powered on fine and when plugged into the charger it appeared to charge with an occasional ""no charging"" display but unplugging and replugging ""fixes"" that. After getting my notes, I have since powered it off and was planning on charging it some day I was free as I don't want it catching fire on me during my sleep or something like that. I thought it was acid and I read online that baking soda would neutralize it? I'm not sure so I stuffed the port with baking soda. It did appear to pull some of the green liquid either from the interior or the port because areas of the baking soda turned green. I did this about 3 or 4 times till the baking soda became clear. I then scrubbed it out with a toothbrush. Now I just see a small section of green and baking soda residue. I could still do the alcohol though if that will help and I need something to clean the baking soda anyways. I don't think it made it to the interior but I'm not sure. I had the ipad inside chipotle sauce vertically for no more then 5 - 10 minutes and then horizontally for 90 to 120 minutes hours before I noticed and cleaned it."
ipad,3bkosq,scubascratch,2,Tue Jun 30 06:32:22 2015 UTC,"I am pretty certain there is no acid here. Lithium ion batteries don't have acid like a car battery. And they are definitely not going to leak any from a hot sauce touch.  The green stuff you are seeing, is the result of electrolysis of conductive metals through salt ions in the sauce."
ipad,3bkosq,scubascratch,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:22:50 2015 UTC,"So what do you think the verdict is? Should I clean it up with the alcohol and it's good to go?

Not very tech savvy but my only worse case scenario concerns are that it crashes on me or spontaneous combustion. thanks in advance!"

I have one percent left right now. And I've got 7 hours of usage with 89 percent of it from asphalt 8. If I don't play games and just watch Netflix I will get like 10-13 hours of usage. Standby is great! Generally 3-10 days of standby depending on usage.  I have the Notification Center and the control panel with the blurred thingy activated. Both are fine, no delays."

I've tried the various anti-glare films and none work well enough.   I feel like such a jackass having to carry both around so I generally just carry the iPad when we go away which means no reading on the beach for me.  Boo.  Good luck with your decision.

Kindle is great for Gutenberg books, but if I'm reading a longer novel I'll take the physical book.

I simply don't use cases for my devices because usually they have too much bulk, or they're simply in the way more than being useful. I haven't dropped any of my devices so I'm not worried about impact protection, moreso for scratches.  I have the first iPad Air and it first perfectly. Thin enough that I don't notice it too much (feels like an iPad 2 without any case), but sturdy enough that it won't bend or flex out of place. The microfibre cover is fantastic, after leaving the cover on it'll get rid of any fingerprints and the magnets are very strong. It has a small metal plate in the back so when you flip the cover over, it'll stay. Best part about the cover is the origami folding! I can position my iPad in 3 ways - slightly tiled for typing, vertically up for reading books, or landscape up for videos. I've had this case since I got my iPad and there isn't a single scratch on my iPad's aluminum body or screen. I don't baby my devices either, it's thrown in my bag for school and slides around my desk and bed all the time.   If you're looking for a lightweight case, this is it. If you're looking for impact protection, this isn't what you're looking for. TBH, you're not going to find any impact protection from any case except for something like an otter box... but then it makes your iPad into essentially a chunk of rubber."

Some materials protect better than others for the same amount of bulk/weight. If you are a klutz and tend to have your iPad over hard surfaces then you should get a thick case.  I personally use a cheap thin silicone case with no screen protector. However my iPad rarely leaves my place and if dropped will only fall 3 feet onto a padded high pile carpet over a plywood floor. The rare times I do travel with it I have a padded carry bag for it.  My sister uses her iPad 4 over a hardwood floor and concrete, she invested in an Otterbox case and has been happy with it.

ipad,3bbrxq,masgrada,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:34:35 2015 UTC,"They can iMessage your phone number and it'll do the same as you just said. But That won't help much if they have android, which is where SMS comes in.   Your odd correction makes me wonder if you realize that.. 1. Up to date iPads/iPods can message/call from your iPhone phone number (yes number) connected to the same Apple ID 2. Green texts carry over from your phone to your alternative iOS devices if within the same wifi network, or vicinity of your phone via local Bluetooth/wifi relay, direct from the device.  3. Same for all of the above with OSX and watchOS as well  2 and 3 are a feature of OSX 10.9 and iOS 8"
ipad,3bbrxq,InsaneNinja,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:57:19 2015 UTC,My odd correction? I was merely addressing the differences in using IMessages with Apple IDs instead of a phone number.  OPdid not specify in this question if he'd be using either.
ipad,3bbrxq,masgrada,8,Sun Jun 28 20:05:22 2015 UTC,"On your iPhone, go into settings > messages. There's an option called ""text message  forwarding"". You can use that to select what devices to forward to - an iPad, Mac, etc."

ipad,3bbrxq,TheDarkRedKnight,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:46:28 2015 UTC,Both. You can also answer calls from your iPhone on your iPad.
ipad,3bbrxq,Crazy_Drago,-12,Sat Jun 27 20:46:31 2015 UTC,"Only iMessages and only when you're connected to wifi (obviously).  It gets a little annoying if you get a text and don't get to it right away.  Your iPhone will ding.  Then your iPad will ding.  I have a Mac so that dings too if I don't get to it soon enough.  But yes, you can use the same Apple ID on all your devices and send/received messages on all of them."
ipad,3bbrxq,LondonPilot,6,Sun Jun 28 03:12:21 2015 UTC,"Only iMessages...   You can get text messages too, if you set your Continuity settings correctly."

ipad,3bbrxq,GarryLumpkins,0,Sat Jun 27 20:47:36 2015 UTC,I do not have an iPhone however from my friends that do I understand that you can use the same iMessage account on both devices. I don't believe standard text messages will show up on your iPad however.  edit: spreading misinformation
ipad,3bbvcc,Ymca667,5,Sat Jun 27 19:05:11 2015 UTC,"If you have documentation showing you purchased them, like a receipt with serial numbers, they can do this at an Apple Store Genius Bar."
ipad,3bbvcc,scubascratch,3,Sat Jun 27 20:37:34 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I don't have that kind of documentation. The only receipt I was issued was a statement from the school confirming payment under my ID number. No serial numbers, unfortunately."
ipad,3bbvcc,DoctorWhookah,3,Sat Jun 27 23:47:01 2015 UTC,"If when you say ""setup"" you mean the initial Apple Activation process, then these are assigned to an MDM via Apple Device Enrollment Program (DEP). So not only would the school IT department need to remove the device from the MDM, they need to figure out who is in charge of DEP and have the serial numbers removed from that database.   It is not a big deal to do (MDM/DEP admin here). If they are in fact enrolled in DEP then no amount of going into recovery mode is going to fix your issue."
ipad,3bbvcc,DoctorWhookah,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:38:28 2015 UTC,"So what should I tell the IT department when I call them again on Monday?  The whole thing is that we were given incorrect instructions by our technology consultant. He put out a message saying that if we were faced with the management screen during activation, we should just go through one more time without putting in an apple ID. I did that on all of them, and then when it didn't work, I called the district tech office, and I was told that the instructions were wrong. The manager there told me to go into recovery mode/dfu mode and restore as a new iPad.   The interesting thing is, on one of them, it tries to update to 8.1.3 and fails with code 2009. This iPad is now in a kind of bricked state, only able to loop between apple logo and connect to iTunes screen. The other updates, but the invalid profile screen did not go away after the restore. I am now totally confused... I thought Apple's software was touted for its simplicity and reliability."
ipad,3bbvcc,DoctorWhookah,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:55:13 2015 UTC,"If I recall, error 2009 is a time issue. The device needs to sync with Apple's time servers. If the time is off, it won't work. But this is off the top of my head.    So tell me, is this happening during the initial activation process? Like when you're answering questions about your country, do you want to create a passcode, do you want to sent diagnostics to Apple? If so then my guess is DEP. I can't tell you what to ask the tech guys to do unless I know exactly what is happening."
ipad,3bbvcc,doctor_jpar,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:08:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, the issue with the one that is actually booting is during activation. It will get to a screen saying that it is managed by so and so district, and it prompts me to continue. When I do, it tries to connect to the server, but since its already been removed from the server, it says ""Invalid Profile"". The only options then are to go back to the steps preceding.  Also, how can I sync the time on the bricked one when I can't even get it to boot? Is this something the apple store could help me with?"
ipad,3bbvcc,doctor_jpar,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:22:42 2015 UTC,"Ok, it has been taken care of from an MDM perspective. Now you need to contact the district and ask them who sends them the iPads. You need to speak to someone not at the school level but at the county or city whichever is appropriate level.   You need to know who is in charge of the Apple DEP. The Device Enrollment Program has a web portal that this person will log into using two factor authentication (in my case I get a code sent to my iPhone and have to provide it at login) and in that portal there is an option to ""Disown Device"". This is what you need them to do. IT can be done by serial number.  So they will need to disown ALL 3 devices. Only then will activation actually work for you."
ipad,3bbvcc,doctor_jpar,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:26:10 2015 UTC,What MDM is it?
ipad,3bbvcc,marythegr8,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:31:06 2015 UTC,"From what I remember, it is Symantec MDM. I guess this is why it's a pain in the ass to work with."
ipad,3bbvcc,marythegr8,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:26:07 2015 UTC,"DoctorWhookah is correct. The only way you're getting past this is by contacting the powers that be™ who run the systems, explaining the situation, and having them remove the device on that end.   If it were a simple config profile, a restore would clear you.  Source: Mobile Solutions Architect."
ipad,3bbvcc,mooters01,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:11:37 2015 UTC,"Wait, so where is the iPad getting the info to tell me that it is run by so and so district? The school district has supposedly removed the device from their supervision. Can you explain how the iPad accesses this kind of information with no connection anymore? Is this all due to the locked down profile that's on my iPad? I'm a noob when it comes to Apple devices since I'm more of an android guy, but I'd like to learn how this is possible.   Thanks for the continued replies, by the way :)  P.S.: Also, I think I've narrowed down the cause of the error with the other iPad. For some reason, my Apple Mobile Device Driver is malfunctionibg. I tried reinstalling iTunes three times, but the iPad won't be recognized by the PC. Anyone have any ideas on how to fix this kind of issue?"

I don't know if apple also replaces the glass screen covering when you buy a refurbished iPad.  It says on their website that they replace ""the outer shell.""  I don't know if that includes the glass."
