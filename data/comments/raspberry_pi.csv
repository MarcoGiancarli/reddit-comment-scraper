raspberry_pi,3e2odq,Kenny__Loggins,56,Tue Jul 21 14:21:52 2015 UTC,"I do this, but the Pi is not ideal as a file server. Since the USB ports and the ethernet are on the same bus, your throughout is severely limited, so file transfers are unfortunately very slow."
raspberry_pi,3e2odq,bradmont,10,Tue Jul 21 15:37:36 2015 UTC,"This should be higher up.  It's not very good as a server, and that's to just serve files.  If you want to serve multimedia that may require streaming (like Plex) then it's completely useless."
raspberry_pi,3e2odq,aonysllo,13,Tue Jul 21 16:19:17 2015 UTC,If you want to serve multimedia that may require streaming (like Plex) then it's completely useless.   I disagree. I have my pi set up as my multimedia server with a 1TB external HD. Streaming video or audio to my PC/laptop/phone works just fine.
raspberry_pi,3e2odq,Forma313,6,Tue Jul 21 17:56:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, as long as you are streaming inside your network, if you stream to the exterior and plex decides to transcode, it won't work.  At least that has been my experience.  If that's not the case, please let me know your setup."
raspberry_pi,3e2odq,aonysllo,4,Tue Jul 21 18:12:03 2015 UTC,"My attempts at streaming to outside my network have not been successful, no. I'm not sure whether to blame the pi or my ISP though.  Not working with Plex BtW, it's just a SAMBA server."
raspberry_pi,3e2odq,Forma313,4,Tue Jul 21 18:18:52 2015 UTC,"Oh, OK, yes, Plex is really cool, especially to access your media from outside your firewall.  But plex sometimes decide to transcode to a lower quality if (I think) it detects a slow connection.  Which is actually pretty cool, but only if you have a good enough processor that can handle transcoding on the fly.  If not, the results are worse than they would be with a slow connection.  As far as sharing your files over samba outside your network.  Look into smbfs or even better sshfs.  Although those two may be for linux only.  FWIW, linux is a much better server than windows."
raspberry_pi,3e2odq,aonysllo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:25:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i tried using sshfs to stream to Kodi (well, xbmc at the time) it kind of sort of worked, but only with the smaller files. My upload speed just isn't good enough for anything else."
raspberry_pi,3e2odq,Forma313,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:29:00 2015 UTC,"This will depend on your Plex server configuration. If it's set to auto then yes, it'll downgrade the quality in favor of speed. Otherwise you're transcoding at a quality setting that can't change without adjusting settings."
raspberry_pi,3e2odq,koodeta,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:31:32 2015 UTC,"You can force the pi to transcode, did you try that?  If transcoding outside your local network fails it is a combination of bandwidth issues and transcoding. Using the web client locally forces transcoding for divx and xvid files so you can see transcoding works, as soon as you need to stream outside your home network transcoding and compression levels need to increase which is where the Pi 2 will struggle."
raspberry_pi,3e2odq,blindpet,3,Tue Jul 21 20:26:42 2015 UTC,Yep.  That's what I was interested in.  What is the best way to do that then?  Just run an external off a laptop?
raspberry_pi,3e2odq,jabies,4,Tue Jul 21 16:57:21 2015 UTC,"I'm mildly afraid to say this:  Remember that there are other low cost computers that may meet your purposes better than the pi, or be cheaper than the pi.   That said, I use my pi as a file server and it works just fine. I play media to a TV over hdmi just fine, and I have flexget and transmission to automatically download whatever I'm watching. You just need a USB hub with a power adapter since the pi won't supply as much current as many External HD's require."
raspberry_pi,3e2odq,blindpet,2,Tue Jul 21 19:13:36 2015 UTC,"Depends on the hard drive, 2.5"" drives are powered by the Raspberry Pi sufficiently"
raspberry_pi,3e2odq,AaronInCincy,5,Tue Jul 21 20:44:43 2015 UTC,"The best way is to build a server, or a NAS.  Depending on the specs of the laptop, it may work in a pinch.  Both will be better than a pi which for all useful intents won't work."
raspberry_pi,3e2odq,aonysllo,2,Tue Jul 21 17:21:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, if you are going to run a plex server, then you need some muscle behind it.  I'm not much of an expert on plex, but it seems to me that if plex detects a slow connection, it will transcode down, so it doesn't have to send so much.  The problem is that if you have a slow machine, then it konks.  The work around is to tell plex not to transcode but then if you have a slow connection you get shit at the other end.  I run plex and rarely watch anything from outside.  A couple of weeks ago I was on vacation at a beach house and they had a relatively slow connection, on a rainy day, I decided to watch one of my movies from home.  It was nearly impossible.  It kept freezing."
raspberry_pi,3e2odq,wmarsh,4,Tue Jul 21 17:33:09 2015 UTC,"It's not just for slow connections, but for devices that just don't support the source video format or profile. A low-powered device can't necessarily play an HD h.264 vid, and is just going to balk at a high-bitrate WMV if it knows what a WMV is at all. So Plex has to transcode for those devices, and the RPI isn't up to the job.  Plex will simply stream the video as-is (no transcoding) if the network and playback device can handle it, which the RPI will probably handle just fine."
raspberry_pi,3e2odq,Bladelink,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:39:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I didn't think rasplex (if that's still alive) did any real transcoding at all."

Yes, the network bandwidth on the Pi B was slow. It topped out at 30 Mb/s. It turns out that the real cause of this was the slow CPU. The Pi 2 maxes out it's built-in 100 Mb/s Ethernet while talking to a USB disk drive at the same time. That is hardly ""severely limited"".

raspberry_pi,3e2odq,ha5hmil,26,Tue Jul 21 20:48:09 2015 UTC,"Right - so i'm pretty new to Raspberry Pi. i got the new Raspberry Pi 2 on Friday. and i have literally spent my whole weekend setting up my Pi as a file server + plex media server + torrent box. I have a 4TB external hard drive hooked up - and oh dear god, the frustration that i went through. But now i have it all running smoothly i have an immense feeling of accomplishment. yay to me!  So, if you are interested here is a brief summery of what i did. All of this was done by googling - and miserably failing and sometimes having to start from scratch. if you want any further details let me know i'll try and answer to the best of my ability.   Set up the pi with Raspbian. I chose Raspbian because there seems to be a lot of community help out there for this distro.  Hard Disks - POWER: first important thing is most of my USB 3 portable hard drives didnt simply work. i learnt the hard way that you need additional USB powered hub to power these suckers separately. Luckily my 4TB one comes with a power cable. Hard Disks - FORMAT: FAT32 and NTFS works fine. For NTFS you need to install the ntfs-3g package. i ended up re-formatting it to EXT4 within the PI's terminal because it appears that Linux natively works with the EXT4 better. Hard Disks - PERMISSIONS: this is a big one which made me spend countless hours trying to find out why i can't copy things over or make new files in the hard disk after mounting it. It turned out to be a simple matter of setting the right permissions. i have given full read write access to the username i use. Hard Disks - SAMBA: Samba is sort of the thing that lets you access your hard drives via the PI using a PC or Mac. You will need to configure this so that your hard drives will appear on your network. Plex Media Server - it's also important to install the right transcoding tools so that it will play all kind of file formats. i followed these instructions here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OVEmTPZomI  Torrents - i set up Transmission. i can remotely access it via the web and add torrents easily. You need to give Transmission the right permissions for this to work properly. i followed this (which has instructions for setting up HDDs, SAMBA etc as well) https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=51219&f=36   other little things i did:   edited /etc/fstab so that the hard drives mounted at boot set up SSH, so i can remotely access the terminal - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUbrypvjnts set up auto login, so i dont have to login to the thing every single time: http://www.opentechguides.com/how-to/article/raspberry-pi/5/raspberry-pi-auto-start.html  set up VNC. so i can access the GUI if i needed to http://elinux.org/RPi_VNC_Server some general initial PI setup instructions from here was followed at the begining http://www.instructables.com/id/Ultimate-Raspberry-Pi-Configuration-Guide/?ALLSTEPS set up avahi-daemon, so that i dont have to know the ip address of the raspberry pi everytime. i can just use 'http://raspberrypi.local'    some other notes.    file transfers are not that quick. it's pretty slow. 1GB takes about 4 minutes on a wired, and 10 minutes on the cheap wifi dongle. (also using the EXT4 formatting for the HDD - i hear the NTFS and other formats can be slower, but cannot verify this myself.) but this is not an issue to me because i have torrents downloading directly to my HDD.  i plugged in a wifi dongle initially, but found that network speeds were pretty slow compared to a wired connections. especially when copying over files to the hard drives, and playing videos on Plex via my Roku or iPhone. may be if i got a 5ghz dongle it would be better, but that's something to experiment later with. use a class 10 SD card. i initally used a class 4 SD card. then read about how much better the class 10 cards performed, so ended up cloning the SD card to the new class 10 one. and i can actually see better perfomance overall.  somewhere along the line i followed some instructions that made me install ""jessie"", which i think is a flavour of the raspbian distro. it fucked everything up for me and wouldnt get Plex to work. I had to downgrade - and that was not a fun process at all.    Hope this helps. I started this on Friday and finished it all just yesterday (probably spent about 10 to 15 hours in total, as i ended up mucking about a lot)  TL;DR: Set up PI as a NAS+Plex Media Server+ Torrent box. Learnt things the hard way, above lists what i did, and some learning from the mistakes.  My starting point was this - http://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-pi-NASUPNP-MP3-Streaming-Torrent-Box-hea/ though it doesnt use Transmission as the torrent client.  edit - ALSO - if interested, i can make the .iso image of my SD card ready at somepoint. so if anyone reading this who wants to do this wouldnt have to waste time setting it up. though i think setting it up is part of the fun!"
raspberry_pi,3e2odq,ha5hmil,2,Tue Jul 21 15:48:36 2015 UTC,"Wow.  Thanks for the extremely thorough walkthrough.  A couple quick questions:   someone else above said that the speed would be so slow using  a RPi for this application that it is not even worth doing.  Thoughts? I've never used Plex, but you can basically stream anything from your RPi to your other devices using it correct?"
raspberry_pi,3e2odq,ha5hmil,2,Tue Jul 21 17:01:31 2015 UTC,"no worries. it's all new to me and had a lot of fails before doing it all successfully.   to answer your questions:   it IS slow. the Pi (i think) has USB 2.0 ports. so you are restricted mostly by that. BUT - it all depends on what you intend to use it for. if you want to store a bunch of movies and have it stream it to all your devices in full 1080p, then yes, it works flawlessly. Seeking or scrubbing through is not as snappy as it could be, but personally it seems pretty reasonable. otherwise, for using as a normal filesever like video editing off it and stuff might be a bit slow. it could be used for nightly backups and stuff i guess, but it is slow. there are so many services that let you stream your content to other devices. XBMC is one other popular servie. but i like Plex because it's so damn easy to use - and the way it automatically organise your content. It find cover arts and details for every single film and TV episodes, and has a sort of netflix like experience. also the availability of apps for it on multiple devices for plex is another plus. you can get plex client for the Roku, amazon tv, android TV,iOS devices, xbox, playstation (for some which you have to pay for). you can try running to plex server on your computer and try accessing with a plex client on another device to see how it works."
raspberry_pi,3e2odq,know_worra_mean,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:15:58 2015 UTC,I wouldn't do much than movies and music probably.  One other thing.  You mentioned doing nightly backups with it. What would you be backing up exactly?

raspberry_pi,3e2odq,Bladelink,2,Tue Jul 21 17:45:28 2015 UTC,Rsync will sort you out
raspberry_pi,3e2odq,blindpet,2,Tue Jul 21 18:30:52 2015 UTC,Yep. Set up a script on a cron job. Rsync can backup right over ssh too.
raspberry_pi,3e2odq,ha5hmil,2,Tue Jul 21 19:00:09 2015 UTC,"Pretty good write-up. A few points:   set up auto login   This makes me a little sheepish. If any device on your network gets compromised, the pi could be assumed to be compromised as well. Some more advanced configurations allow this without the security hole, like joining the Pi to a domain.   set up VNC   If you apt-get install xrdp and open port 3389 (if you have a local firewall), you can just connect straightaway with almost no configuration. Just fyi for other people.   set up avahi-daemon   If you have multiple machines on the network that you want to reach, consider switching to static leases from the DHCP server/gateway.   made me install ""jessie""   Jessie is the current release of Debian (debian 8), which Raspbian is a fork of for the Pi. Doing a ""rpi-update"" will give a warning at this point that it will push you to the new major version, and I think it double checks with you before proceeding. Most packages should be fine, but independently managed repos like Plex might not yet be on the bandwagon.  As a side note for people using wifi, just install wicd-curses and save yourself a shitload of trouble fucking with network interfaces and wpa-supplicant. That stuff is a pain in the ass and it doesn't always recover from disconnection unless a daemon is babysitting it for you."

If it's a TFT may be able to drive it straight off the GPIOs depending on the interface.  Do you have a model number for the screen / any way which we can use to identify the screen or look up a data sheet? Just saying ""I have a screen"" doesn't help much. What's most important here is to have some way of identifying what type of interfaces your screen panel has. Knowing the exact model of the laptop you extracted the screen from may help.

raspberry_pi,3e2ht9,silverforest,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:23:24 2015 UTC,"What's most important is you find out what screen panel you have. How you find out doesn't matter.  What you need to do is:   Figure out what panel you have.  Look up the datasheet online by googling ""<model number> datasheet"", or use some other method of finding out what kind of interface it has. If it has a LVDS interface, great! Get a LVDS-to-HDMI board. Otherwise, you might be able to find a different driver board.   To answer your question: Those boards you linked to will work only if your screen uses a LVDS interface.  Let's use a recent MBP as an example:   MBP uses a LP154WT1 display panel. Google LP154WT1, find this: http://i.imgur.com/0RdwxE2.png Shit it uses eDP. With my knowledge of interface technologies, I know I can get an eDP to DisplayPort adapter, then a DisplayPort to HDMI adapter to hook it up to a Pi.

Pull the LCD out of it's current case/laptop and look for the model number.  Using the model number you can find a LVDS to HDMI converter.  If the original LCD has touch, you'll need a touch driver as will with USB for ease of use.  If the original LCD doesn't have touch, you should be able to find a film that you can lay over the screen which provide the touch interface (it should come with it's own driver and power source).

As for your suggestions, my first line of thing was to search the immediate network for that Pi-specific MAC address. I'm not finding it though. The network is really big — tens of thousands of devices — so using the suggested router techniques is not a possibility. That's where I started hitting problems. As I said, the situation does not permit me a monitor or peripherals to work with (short of forking out 5 times the value of the Pi in cash) so it's a bit of a challenge on that front. Working this out has been interesting and educational. Thanks again for replying and for the links provided. I'll go over all those sources again and look for a workaround, and I'm particularly interested in the Pi Finder for Mac. If you have any other ideas, I'd love it if you shared them. Thanks."
raspberry_pi,3e3e3m,2_advil_please,3,Tue Jul 21 19:05:40 2015 UTC,"Assuming that you are authorized to attach this device to the organization's network: (If not, stop right here). Attach a monitor and keyboard.  Log in.  Change the default password. Run ""ifconfig"" to see the IP in use.  No packets on the network and no scanning needed.  Scanning a large network with nmap will generally cause security systems in place on the network to throw up alerts.  Alerts that might get you into a bit of trouble."
raspberry_pi,3e3e3m,cyleleghorn,2,Tue Jul 21 18:37:37 2015 UTC,"This is correct.  You need to run something like ifconfig to get the ip address.  You will need peripherals to do that, and also to enable SSH in the first place upon first boot of the pi.  There is a second option however, that wouldn't require any peripherals.  Find a raspbian sd card image with SSH already enabled, boot it up, and scan the network with something like ""Angry IP Scanner"" or something else you can find for the mac that can resolve host names.  The pi is by default called ""raspberrypi"" IIRC, so if you resolve the host names and you are the only person on the network with a pi, you should know the ip address after that!  I used to do scans like that in my high school to figure out the teacher's computers so I could log into their VNC servers, hehe, and I've also done it in college and in hotels just to see who else is on the network.  I think scanning ip addresses like that, as long as you aren't ""knocking"" on any ports or doing anything that could be considered malicious, you should not throw any alerts as /u/2_advil_please mentioned."
raspberry_pi,3e3e3m,cyleleghorn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:57:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input and detailed response. I have kinda spent the last couple hours pillaging the network with nmap, but I haven't been blocked or notified and I couldn't find anything in the acceptable use policy that prohibits the use of scanners. As long as the action isn't ""malicious"" — which is true if you consider the goal of my endeavours — then it seems to be allowed. I was under the impression that a headless setup could be performed because SSH was already enabled? Some pages I found seemed to imply that. I'll look further into it. Once again, I really appreciate your response."
raspberry_pi,3e3e3m,2_advil_please,2,Tue Jul 21 19:11:18 2015 UTC,"It used to be enabled by default in older versions of raspbian, but not anymore! You can maybe find a version of raspbian with ssh already enabled but most sites I saw after a Google search just tell you how to enable it by renaming a system file before you write the os to the sd card. This can be done with a basic file explorer.  If you can't modify the os before writing it to the sd card, you'll need to have a monitor and keyboard connected on first boot to enable it under the advanced options, or type rpi-config in the terminal to bring that first boot menu back up.  As for nmap, I know it's powerful, but I have no idea how to use it. All you need to do is resolve hostnames to the ip addresses. The pi should show up if ethernet is connected while it powers up, even if ssh isn't enabled, although there's not much you can do just knowing the ip address. Can you not hijack a keyboard and monitor from another workstation for 5 minutes to enable ssh? You don't even need the ethernet to enable it, then you can bring it back wherever you want it to be setup and get ssh access into it to get it updated and play around. That device is so fun haha"
raspberry_pi,3e3e3m,cyleleghorn,2,Tue Jul 21 19:29:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response, cyleleghorn. I appreciate you taking the time and providing a thorough explanation. I could likely get hold of a USB keyboard, but it's the monitor that's the problem — I need HDMI from the Pi, but all the workstations are cheap VGA only monitors. I'm going to try and find a TV to use if all else fails. But, as I said, I really am grateful for your response."
raspberry_pi,3e3e3m,Robotimus,2,Tue Jul 21 19:40:51 2015 UTC,"If you are using Angry IP or Nmap and scanning all systems in a subnet for TCP 22, you will absolutely be setting off alarms in network security systems.  They'll show up as a ""horizontal scan"" once you pass the thresholds set in those systems.  Same source IP, same destination port, above X number of different destination IPs, and all under a certain amount of time.  The question is whether your organization has this level of visibility/capability, decides to consider this malicious/worth investigating, or even cares.  Good organizations will have tooling that will be a right-click away to say ""oh, look, the computer that has one user logged in named SingleUnifyingTheory is running a horizontal scan for port 22"".  Some even have a ""right-click > disable network access at the switch"" tooling, too, to temp ban your MAC address."
raspberry_pi,3e3e3m,WasterDave,2,Tue Jul 21 19:22:57 2015 UTC,"That would set off alarms I'm sure, but you shouldn't need to scan for any port in particular..

Since windows and Mac computers basically do this anyways to identify computers they can share files with, there's nothing bad about it at all"
raspberry_pi,3e3e3m,jezmck,2,Tue Jul 21 19:32:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I was doing initially, but there were too many results and the typical Pi MAC address wasn't showing up, so I took to scanning for SSH enabled on port 22.

raspberry_pi,3e2ynu,TripEllington,2,Tue Jul 21 15:40:12 2015 UTC,"On the pi 2, I feel like it would work decently.. I don't think it would be too slow.  As long as the tablets work under linux they'll work on the pi, and gimp can be installed easily enough!  Once you get one pi set up with the tablet drivers and gimp installed with an icon on the desktop (or even autorunning on boot) you can make a backup .img of the entire sd card and write that to all the other pi's so you only have to do the setup once.  From what I saw with some googling, it's not a matter of the Pi not having enough power to get the tablet working, it's a matter of configuring the software side of things first.  As long as you can get the drivers running one time though, in a working configuration, just image a bunch of sd cards and put them in all of the pis.  Maybe give your wife a few extras so if the kids break anything (on the software side) she could just pop the old sd card out and put a new one in, and have you re-image the corrupted one that night.  This sounds like a great idea and I would love to hear how it turns out!  If you have any questions about linux or making any of this stuff work, I'll try to help as much as I can!"
raspberry_pi,3e2ynu,cyleleghorn,2,Tue Jul 21 18:50:46 2015 UTC,"I think this will work.   Ubuntu has drivers for this, but they are x86.  I found this:   As you say, the Wacom Bamboo is detected as a USB device, but is not installed as an HID device. The key driver, wacom.ko, is missing from the drivers folder. The way to get this is to download the latest version of linux wacom (linuxwacom-0.9.5.tar.bz2) and to compile it. However, the raspi ARM kernel headers are also required. sudo apt-get install linux-headers-3.2.0-3-rpi 'Extract Here' and open the resulting folder with the file manager. Tools/Open Current Folder in Terminal. The configure script needs to be told where the kernel src files are, sudo ./configure --enable-wacom --prefix=/usr --with-kernel=/usr/src/linux-headers-3.2.0-3-common That's as far as I get. the configure script reports no ncurses, but that is installed. It refuses to create wacom.o which is the necessary precursor to wacom.ko. I hope that the current xorg wacom drivers will be just fine if we can just get the wacom.ko driver created. Once the Wacom is working we can then worry about xsetwacom to configure it correctly. Regards, Roy Leith   from https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=63&t=8709"

raspberry_pi,3dwjx5,Dain42,2,Mon Jul 20 14:30:11 2015 UTC,"That is insane. According to ttraff on our router, my boyfriend and I have used about 55 GB in the past three days alone.  Now, granted, I was moving some games around and uninstalling and reinstalling some of them (to get clean installs; there were a few that had clearly built up some kruft in their install folder in Steam) in preparation for my Win10 upgrade/fresh install. But still...there are some games out there that are 50+GB a pop. And streaming video isn't exactly low bandwidth either.  Those kind of restrictions just should not be permitted. You want to offer service to an area, you need to build out your network to support it properly."
raspberry_pi,3dwjx5,GalaxyBread,3,Mon Jul 20 14:47:56 2015 UTC,"It is ridiculous, although I have learned how to conserve bandwidth better and If I download a large file, that gets backed up on an external HD. If I get a new game I go to my grandparents house where they have dsl and I can get the 50gb+ files and a free lunch lol. Honestly it does suck and I don't really stream video or watch YouTube. Twitch is a definite no unless it's the last day and I've managed to save a gig somehow. It honestly comes down to knowing my limits and adapting to them. I still havent decided how im going to go about my win 10 download. Its only 3gb but thats a lot for me. Tldr don't move to the country if you like Internet."

I'm annoyed at mine right now, not for bandwidth issues or anything (currently, at least), but for some really crummy uptimes. Our internet will go out at least several times a week for 5+ minute stretches (and often significantly longer). We'll have a multi-hour outage several times per year, and I've had two outages since I moved in in Dec 2012 that lasted more than 4 days (one lasted a whole week).  it's like they're running their operation with equipment that's constantly on the verge of failure.

That's why checking for command success in that way is a little bit more versatile than using && (though that's the best if you just want to conditionally run the next command)."

Would I be able to add the [ $? -eq 0 ]; command you used? I'm still fairly new to bash scripts so I'm not sure if an echo command or something similar will show on the command line if the rest of the script is running in the background.

To keep it on topic, it'll run a pi b+ with a PiTFT hat for ~7 hours. It doesn't support pass-through though (power briefly drops on the USB outs when plugged into a power source, enough to reboot the pi), so using it as a UPS is a no go. It doesn't have to be turned on though, it'll start providing power as soon as something's plugged in, which means you can attach a switch to the USB, and you don't have to worry about the battery randomly shutting down like you have with other cheap ones.  https://oneplus.net/oneplus-power-bank"

Stick to serving on a desktop/server processor. Remember the raspberry pi is based off a mobile type processor, and does alot of things well. Minecraft is not very efficient which is why it does not work well on anything less than a super powerful laptop or desktop.   Also, Hamachi is crap for this kind of situation. You should only use Hamachi when you are not able to port forward (like no access to the router), and even then it's questionable. You should learn how to port forward on your router.

raspberry_pi,3dv7wx,lightfader,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:33:16 2015 UTC,I'm running plex on my raspberry pi v1.0 just fine.  All the media is on my pc being streamed to the raspi though not from it.
raspberry_pi,3dv7wx,Berserk87,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:56:00 2015 UTC,I put the new CPU in the pi? I'm confused here.
raspberry_pi,3dv7wx,blindpet,2,Sun Jul 19 20:47:26 2015 UTC,"You need to give more information. The Pi 2 does run Plex and it can transcode despite what many people think. It cannot transcode to many devices at once, however. But if you have good Plex clients that can receive the videos directly and do not require transcoding then it is viable.  If you plan on streaming many videos outside your home network then a Pi 2 is not the answer.  So it depends on your use case, size of videos, plex client types etc.  Given you want a server with and that many hard drives I would suggest a Banana Pi or Orange Pi and a SATA port multiplier.  You should not run Plex on models earlier than the Pi 2"
raspberry_pi,3dv7wx,IronManMark20,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:41:01 2015 UTC,"No, /u/lackrays is saying you shouldn't use the Raspberry Pi. The raspi has a processor that is not removable."
raspberry_pi,3dv7wx,brokedown,4,Mon Jul 20 03:40:43 2015 UTC,"No, don't do this. This is exactly the type of thing the Pi is bad at."
raspberry_pi,3dv7wx,blindpet,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:29:42 2015 UTC,This depends entirely what kind of Plex clients he is planning on using and the size and bitrate of the videos.  Did you run tests and what kind of plex clients did you use?
raspberry_pi,3dv7wx,theblindness,2,Sun Jul 19 22:38:37 2015 UTC,"Regarding Pi B+ vs Pi 2 B, the 2 B has a quad core processor, each core roughly 1.5x the speed of the processor on the B+, and also it has 1GB of RAM instead of 512MB. There's not really any reason to buy the B+ anymore. There's another called the A+ which is like the low-power version. $120 worth of pre-owned computer can do much much much more as a video transcoding server. Plus, on a PC you can add gigabit ethernet and USB 3.0 for your hard drives. Your I/O will be 10x faster than on the pi and you'll experience less buffering."
raspberry_pi,3dv7wx,trplingup,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:35:04 2015 UTC,Are you going to use another PC for the server
raspberry_pi,3dv7wx,theblindness,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:14:35 2015 UTC,The pi2 can handle receiving the plex streams and rendering video on your TV as long as your Plex server with all the hard drives is a regular computer.

raspberry_pi,3dt7ww,nebalee,2,Sun Jul 19 06:19:39 2015 UTC,What frame rates per resolution are you seeing? Have you used a Pi 2 with any motion processing and seen any improvements?
raspberry_pi,3dt7ww,XPostLinker,2,Sun Jul 19 17:51:04 2015 UTC,If I remember right 640x480 at 75% quality and I get 14fps roughly. But I also have it save a snapshot every 10 seconds. So if I disable it I am sure it will be higher. I'll test later. I am at work at the moment.
raspberry_pi,3du1t1,Uber_Pwnage,9,Sun Jul 19 13:46:48 2015 UTC,You need to power the Pi with 5v only.  Are you sure the microUSB charger is 9v?  I've never seen a microUSB adapter that wasn't 5v.
raspberry_pi,3du1t1,swap_file,3,Sun Jul 19 14:22:41 2015 UTC,It's my 6s Edge fast charger that could be why.

raspberry_pi,3du1t1,ghillisuit95,2,Sun Jul 19 14:46:37 2015 UTC,how would you check a micro usb cable with a multimeter?
raspberry_pi,3du1t1,jezmck,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:51:03 2015 UTC,"If the cable's integrated then with difficulty, otherwise by checking the pins in the socket."
raspberry_pi,3du1t1,theblindness,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:56:17 2015 UTC,This is the right answer. The question has been asked here before. Quickchargers work fine for the pi in a pinch. It's just a waste of a really cool charger on a device that would be more than happy with the charger from your old Galaxy S2.
raspberry_pi,3du1t1,windows7323,4,Sun Jul 19 18:14:58 2015 UTC,If you look on the side of the charger it's 5V 2A and 9V 1.67A

raspberry_pi,3du1t1,MeOfAllTrades,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:08:53 2015 UTC,"I just copied this answer from the third Google result when I typed in ""can I use a 9v adapter with a raspberry pi"". I left out the bit about your friend cause it was too much to type but Google seemed to get the gist.    According to Raspberry Pi forums, you can supply 5V with a ±5% uncertainty, meaning you could supply from 4.75 to 5.25 volts. The 7805 voltage regulator should be okay for your project, for it could supply a max of 1A and it stays within that uncertainty. This leaves you with an additional 250mA for connecting a keyboard or something else that doesn't require much current. For more information on how to use the 7805, refer to this Youtube video.  To answer the original question, you should stick with 5V at all times, with the uncertainty as a means to protect itself from small spikes and dips in voltage."
raspberry_pi,3du1t1,CourseHeroRyan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:15:58 2015 UTC,I wonder what the cost would be to have a voltage regulator that could handle up to 12V.

raspberry_pi,3du1t1,CourseHeroRyan,0,Sun Jul 19 19:01:44 2015 UTC,I'd say using components from adafruit is the worst example for cost comparison. Might as well buy a Monster USB cable.

raspberry_pi,3du1t1,CourseHeroRyan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:58:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was more curious on their end, how much more a regulator would cost to bump it up to a wider input voltage, considering vregs are often less than 50 cents, and on the industrial scale often much less than a dime. I remember Sieko contacting me about their 300ma vregs and those were costing less than 10 cents on an industrial order."
