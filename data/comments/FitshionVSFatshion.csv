Regardless of their shape, they have just terrible fashion. When you allowed yourself a little more creativity, your taste and your great silhouette shined through.   Pic 2 and 4 are both 10's, I'm absolutely in love with them, I can't even pick a favorite. I loved 8, too, but I don't feel like it's the same exact dress. Sure, it's the same pattern and the same colors, but yours show cleavage, has low-waist, and a lower-cut, straight hemline. I can easily read the designer's inspiration in your dress: 50s women drinking mimosas by the pool. Her dress looks like a shirt made for a pregnant woman on her way to do groceries (of course, this woman would pair it with some comfy pants). Are you sure she didn't customize it herself?  You have a nice collection, OP. It makes me want to do a drag fit vs fat one day, it looks like a lot of fun!"

I was pretty sure it's the same one, as my thinking was her chest is much wider so there's no way she could get the waist where it's supposed to be.   But seriously, thank you for the critique!! I'm actually still kind of developing my own style, so it makes me happy that I'm headed in the right direction. But you really should!

I was just saying that your personal style is way, way better than theirs. I'm into drag, and big girls have been a thing for decades. It's just not a matter of (lack of) shape, their terrible taste was evident, too. Look at pic 21, for instance: cute dress, good silhouette, and then you look down and... WTF is that?  About that dress, I thought the same thing at first, but there's not way a female planet would pass away the chance to show dem big wymynly titsteehee! Although the perspective is different, I can see the proportions (above vs below the stitch) are different. It might be the same dress, but she definitely customized, maybe to pretend she has a waist and show her cottage cheese legs.  You should learn how to sew. It's not really hard (it does take a lot of time to get a single piece ready, though), and you seem to have the talent, you have good taste for colors, shapes and fabrics. Every one of your clothes will be unique. Plus, you get to buy fat people's clothes, tear them away and piss those buttergolems off. I decided to learn when I found this blog.  I will most certainly do a drag FvF! Once I get rid of my exams, I'll have time to try my worst to look like them, it'll be hilarious!"

FitshionVSFatshion,371mgm,prophetiamortis,17,Wed May 27 12:05:02 2015 UTC,"Ugh. rant incoming i'm a nerd about corsets   A properly fitting corset doesn't constrict the lungs more than 10% (and normal breathing doesn't use much more than 15% of lung capacity), and doesn't move  internal organs more than pregnancy. The deformed ribcages from the victorian era were likely caused by acids in milk, NOT corsets as that ribcage is always said to be. Most of the ailments said to be caused by corsets were caused by other things, but the doctors just blamed everything on the corset. (and those doctors were so good, with poisons such as arsenic being used as medicine...)  The one thing which was probably true was muscle atrophy but that was due to tightlacing from childhood, nowadays that doesn't happen. The corsetry community is mostly against people younger than 18 tightlacing, a lot even think a person should be closer to 23 before starting as that's when the body is fully grown. I'll shut up now :)  tl;dr: nope. corsets are no worse than bras or heels"
FitshionVSFatshion,371mgm,prophetiamortis,3,Wed May 27 15:20:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you for posting this. Corsets get such a bad rap. As long as you season and wear your corset properly, it is safe. People who injure themselves wearing corsets and usually trying to season it too fast, lace it up tight before they are ready, wearing it for long periods of time before their body is used to it, or did not get the corset custom fitted.   I have asthma and I can breathe fine in mine. I'm also a nurse so I know a thing or two about the human body, and when I am injuring myself."

FitshionVSFatshion,371mgm,emily508,2,Thu May 28 11:47:05 2015 UTC,"It depends on how extreme you go and how rapidly you try to get there. Done properly (read: over a very long period of time) and not going to the extreme of pressing in your floating ribs (the norm in Victorian era unless you were wealthy and being corseted from youth in which case it did effect actual bone structure), it's fine to do. Most modern waist trainees do not go to dangerous extremes, and, provided extremes aren't reached, waist training is much like exercise where going long periods without it will result in your body going back to how it was before you ever began training.    Provided you don't fuck with your bones or wear for so many hours daily that your back muscles begin to deteriorate from lack of use (takes consistent full day wears over a long period of time), it really isn't that bad. Just be smart and research it to death before ever even buying one :) And, when you do buy one, make sure it's a high quality custom to guarantee even pressure across the piece. The crap you buy at Frederick's of Hollywood and such is more likely to damage you with consistent use due to the cheap material pressing on you with an uneven pressure. That crap isn't meant for more than decoration."

So i had to go 36 slim which had the sleeves too long. 75 bucks later the waist was pulled in and the sleeves pulled up. I was warned against alfani but it fits me great and was a hell of a deal.

Nude for me would be quite dark. I do have a few other dresses to choose from though.  The dress that looks blue is actually a very dark green colour. It's not warm enough though...

FitshionVSFatshion,34a3qq,AuroraMFCharming,12,Wed Apr 29 15:15:52 2015 UTC,Hi! Don't wear the nude dress. It looks a bit too close to white/off white which is a major no no for weddings. Dark colors are fine for weddings as long as the accessories are sparkly and the style is fun.
FitshionVSFatshion,34a3qq,Nooodles42,7,Sun May 10 07:35:10 2015 UTC,"Ah, gotcha. I think floral would look great with you! Or silver/light gray pumps like the other commenter suggested. Example.   As for the green dress, black pumps would make it too dark I think. As for the nude dress, if you have any bright shoes, like orange, it would be cute with gold jewelry."

Black heels would work with this, but I would personally go with a grey/silver heel or a nude heel. It depends on if you're going to accessorize with jewelry or a cardigan."
FitshionVSFatshion,34a3qq,linziboo,8,Wed Apr 29 15:11:25 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for the tips!  I don't think I could be OK with posting this at femalefashion advice because there will be fatties lurking and I post a great deal of inflammatory stuff to FPH. :/  I dont have silver heels, would gold work? I have gold shoes and a gold bag.   I'm not sure about the jewellery either any input is welcome!"
FitshionVSFatshion,34a3qq,linziboo,5,Wed Apr 29 15:27:23 2015 UTC,Gold would work if it's a shade of gold that would go well with it but most do (purple is a color of royalty and royalty wore a lot of gold). And if you have gold shoes and a gold bag that look good with it then all for it! I'm super white so I tend to go more towards silver and cool toned things so gold typically isn't on my radar.   And ooh but I mean I also post things in FPH and I've never had problems. Most people don't look through other people's comment history unless they're being a massive cunt so I've been careful about being too overly inflammatory on other subreddits (and asking a simple question about a purple dress wouldn't make you one).

FitshionVSFatshion,33hz6k,lycra_belacqua,8,Wed Apr 22 19:08:15 2015 UTC,"Anorexia nervosa is a mental health condition, not a body type (though it does have weight cutoffs). Unless you've seen the episode and she's said she has it, don't label people with the disease. I haven't so I can't say, but at least the episodes I watched, they usually don't have anorexics, it's usually just people who are too busy to care/too lazy to eat, so they don't eat enough.  But I don't think I'd call her fit, either, but not because of her body type. The show is based on people with bad eating habits, so she was chosen for the show specifically because she isn't healthy (though theoretically you could be her weight and be fit - maybe). That is of course unless the show has changed recently, I haven't watched it in a while, but it used to always be a hambeast that ate too much and a skinny person who ate too little and/or non-nutritive food."
FitshionVSFatshion,33hz6k,GRRLofOmicronPersei8,10,Wed Apr 22 19:40:49 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I think the point the person is trying to make is that usually we try to get an overweight person contrasted with a person of a normal weight. I watch that show a lot, and they don't consider you ""superskinny"" unless you have a bmi of under 18, meaning this woman is underweight. Its not against any rules, but I consider it to be a little iffy."
FitshionVSFatshion,33hz6k,fattycant,6,Wed Apr 22 21:36:47 2015 UTC,"Oh, I was agreeing on that point. I don't think it violates any rules either, but assuming the show hasn't changed since I watched it, she is most certainly not fit, as they only showcase 2 unhealthy people. That was my second paragraph.  My problem is using ""anorexic"" as a stand-in for ""underweight."" Anorexia nervosa is a mental disorder, not a body type. I think one of the main reasons this irks me: I have a friend who can't keep food down without having immense pain, and people think she's anorexic because she's underweight. Another point of frustration: lots of people who have anorexia don't look like it (even if they are underweight), and conflating the two is not helpful for people trying to recover. It's not the end of the world or a big deal but it is frustrating, especially because it's usually the fatties throwing ""anorexic"" around without having any idea what that is."

FitshionVSFatshion,33fnlv,fireandbl0od,9,Wed Apr 22 03:25:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're going to have to order online.  There's a bunch of good places to start - Orchard Corset, Restyle.pl, RebelMadness.pl, Mystic City Corsets on Ebay - those are all lower priced but good (I own one from all of them except Restyle - hoping to pick one up over the summer).   Orchard and Mystic City make mesh ones which are nice, and What Katie Did makes a finer mesh one which is also good (it's my favorite right now) but it's a bit more pricey."
FitshionVSFatshion,33fnlv,fireandbl0od,8,Wed Apr 22 03:30:27 2015 UTC,"Those are all ready to wear.  I believe Sylwia of Mystic City does made-to-order and customs, but I hear there's quite a long wait.    Sizing is basically measured by your underbust, waist, high and low hip measurements, and torso length.  Most people start with a 4"" reduction - so if your natural waist is 26"", you'd buy a 22"".  I think Lucy's Corsetry has a really good guide on how to do pick a ready-to-wear based on your measurements.  It can get a little tricky, because if you have larger or smaller than average hips, a corset that fits in the underbust/waist won't fit properly in the hip.  I have a broad frame with large hips, so I have to be kind of picky about my ready-to-wears, but lately I've been buying customs."

I hear ya, I'm doing the same right now - had to put corsets on hold to save for more important stuff.     They really do.  They change the way you hold yourself, the way you move, and you just feel like amazing.  :)"

I don't get why they make an XL size. If you need an XL, Blackmilk is not going to be flattering or attractive whatsoever."
FitshionVSFatshion,30u75o,littlestinky,7,Mon Mar 30 23:10:45 2015 UTC,Thankfully their sizing only goes up to XL (although the fact that it goes down to XXS make me a little curious about how true the sizing is). Kind of silly to size that large though since they'll just end up stretching out the image which defeats the whole purpose of buying their (fairly pricy) clothing.
FitshionVSFatshion,30u75o,littlestinky,3,Mon Mar 30 23:32:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I never got that either. If you're gonna spend just under $100 on a dress, at least make sure the design doesn't distort on your stomach :/  The sizing is spot on, I'm an XXS and pretty much everything in that size fits me."
FitshionVSFatshion,30u75o,ihangoutbythetrolley,4,Mon Mar 30 23:46:10 2015 UTC,Well that's good to hear and a little nerve wracking at the same time haha. I just made my first order from BlackMilk (the dress in the picture is a Chinese knock off from Amazon) and the only size they had left in the print I wanted was XXS. I'm not spot on with the measurements they provided and I'm kind of curious about how much give there is in the material?
FitshionVSFatshion,30u75o,dragonjujo,5,Tue Mar 31 00:06:18 2015 UTC,"It's obviously stretchy haha :)   XXS is small in the chest, so if you have boobs a C cup or higher, you'll have a bad time (if it's low-cut you'll be bursting out or if it's high/turtlenecked you'll be squished into oblivion), but chest down you should be fine :)"

No, I do not hate people simply based on body size. However, it's truly frightening that obesity is not only becoming accepted, it's also becoming the NORM (in the US alone, nearly 70% of the population is overweight/obese). You ask why these people are so against this? It's because obesity is just as bad, if not worse, than smoking, than alcoholism, but fewer people than you think are saying anything about it. It's true that I might not spend much time on this subreddit, but this is getting so ridiculous and I wish that you would see how awful this is.  I might not hate the obese, but I hate obesity. If someone is promoting obesity, whether they be stick thin or elephantine, I will also dislike them.  Edit: Since I don't frequent this sub, I can't really say what everyone here thinks, so I can't answer the first and last part of your question since it's not really my business. I can only tell you what I think, so this is it. I can see why you think this sub is harsh. But whether you like it or not, there is a major issue going on here with some obese people claiming that they ""love"" their bodies, when in reality, they are damaging it. And these same people REFUSE to think logically with the information given to them about obesity. They SHOULD know that what they are doing is wrong and it SHOULD be pointed out to them. People need to learn to improve themselves instead of accepting mediocrity. If you want more info, you might have to ask a subscriber to this subreddit."

Frankly, the reaction to this photo is sickening to me. You're all reinforcing his poor choices.  He's a grown man. He is not a child. Idc how pathetic he looks, stop treating him like someone whose fee fees have to be coddled.  If anyone goes out and looks disgusting and stupid, people are going to stare and laugh. It doesn't matter if you're way way way overweight, or if you're wearing some stupid ass lady Gaga raw meat suit.  Have you ever seen some of the people in Wal Mart? It's disgusting.  Shame is a good thing. We don't shame enough in society, because of this people think it's okay for 70 fucking percent of the US to be overweight.  People care more about not hurting feelings than telling the fucking truth.  The truth is he looked stupid, and people laughed at him. If he doesn't like that, and feels bad about being laughed at  then he should just lose some fucking weight and problem solved.  Instead of throwing him a giant pity party, and acting like any of you really would've given half a fuck about him if not for his sad looking picture, why not focus on getting him to a normal healthy weight if you actually give a shit and care about his feelings?  I guess it's easier to all pat yourselves on the back about how nice and accepting you are because you took pity on a grown man with no self control, and that made extremely bad life choices. By next week everyone would've forgotten about him. It'll go right back to him being an unhealthy fat loser until he eventually gets put in the hospital (and strains the NHS, he's from the UK) and dies an early death."

You can add a big belt and pumps as accessories.

FitshionVSFatshion,2wxxnl,Shitari,44,Tue Feb 24 05:41:48 2015 UTC,"Fat deposit locations are determined by genetics. Shitty genetics means you end up with a flat ass regardless your weight because it's just not where your body stores it and there isn't much you can do about it besides getting ass injections.  Such unfortunate souls need to compensate by putting muscle there instead, something most fat people aren't willing to do. Ergo, fat people with flat asses.   Same goes for girls (fit or fat) with proportionally small boobs, except there is no exercise to get bigger boobs... for them, it's implants or embrace the A cup."

All that happened really is she got an evil bitch look from it and a greater cardio. We changed it up since she likes a soft look. She is all sharp bones and harsh angles. Focused on light walking around 3-4 miles a week and diet. She looks better now, we've added light beer and baileys with ice cream to the diet. The beer helps promote fat retention and the fatty ice cream combined with baileys is a great way to sleep on some reasonably healthy calories. Look for low carb ice cream actually, they tend to be full fat with less junk sugars."

I'm not going to pretend I don't feel somewhat defensive (why bother lying if it's going to come through anyway), so I invite you to have a look through my previous submissions to this subreddit: I've stayed at ~the same weight the whole time I've been using this account, and this is the first time somebody's suggested I look like I'm an unhealthy weight, so I (would like to) think these are just some bad shots?  But once again, thank you for the concern. I realise that you aren't trying to offend or troll, and I'm not upset or angry; just slightly unpleasantly surprised, I suppose. I haven't been eating much recently (poor appetite due to health issues) and it was just a shock to realize I look unhealthy rather than just svelte, I guess. Sorry, I'm rambling now, but yeah.

You don't have to justify your body. In fact it's sort of silly to justify yourself based on someone's opinion. A pair of shoes doesn't start to justify why it's blue, or why its heel is only 3.5"", or why the heel doesn't curve inward, or why it has a platform. It just is, just as you are you. And there's nothing wrong with that.   I personally don't find your body type desirable or flattering in the clothes you've worn and photos you've taken, just like many others who upvoted my post feel the same way. But there are plenty of Redditors who feel otherwise and that is the demographic you appeal to. Nothing wrong with that.

Tagging OP in this post as well: /u/5bucksforatoaster   For basic stretching of the upper back, realigning the spine and opening up the chest, I strongly suggest this simple exercise: Fit & Bendy  For strengthening and opening the rhomboids and chest, try this: look up, then look down. Imagine your throat opens up as a pez dispenser when you look up, and when you look down, the muscles in the back of your neck and upper back stretch long.  Bring your shoulders forward as if trying to touch them together, then bring them back and really concentrate on feeling your upper back muscles bringing your shoulder blades together. Do this several times.   Then lean back your head to pez dispense mode, bring your shoulders and shoulder blades back (keep in mind to have your shoulders down, don't scrunch them up to your ears), and push your chest towards the ceiling, imagine there is a string attached to your sternum and it's getting pulled up and up... Then relax back to normal. Do this several times, while it feels good.   Couple of things to keep an eye out for. Make sure your hips don't get pushed forward, and your lower back is straight. We're not wanting to have your lower back bending forward, just opening up the upper back and working the upper back muscles. Also make sure that you warm up before all this, do 10-20 jumping jacks or after your run.  Another poster mentioned the Child's Pose in a comment. I suggest doing this pose for a minute or two after this back exercise.  I hope I managed to explain it good! If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask :) I'm happy to help."

It's the simple fact that it's absolutely disgusting to let yourself become fat like that. We hate the fact that they continually eat ridiculous amounts more than they need, are lazy, and then act like their body is made to be fat or they have no idea why they're fat. Along with hating the bullshit that they try to push off on everyone by trying to convince people they believe they're beautiful and we should all change what we find beautiful and start thinking they're attractive. It's pathetic. Everything about it is disgusting. Then, if it's not specifically you It's your group acts like complete hypocrites and attacks anyone who is at a healthy weight and acts like skinny people can't ever have good personalities or directly attack how we look whole fighting for people to stop attacking them.   There's plenty more to go in. But you people just don't get it. It has nothing to do with being butthurt or secretly jealous or whatever ya'll have to tell yourselves, it's purely that it's disgusting and we should hold ourselves to a higher standard."

FitshionVSFatshion,2pyk3k,fuckHAES,18,Sun Dec 21 08:17:44 2014 UTC,"Wow, she looks terrible. That dress is really unflattering in the bust area for the larger girl. I can't tell if they put a lot less effort into the photoshoot with her or if she's just a worse model in general; the first girl looks so light and effortlessly put together, whereas the second just looks...frumpy. It's not exactly my style in the first place but that contrast encourages me to stay away, with how easy it is to 'miss' with that dress."
FitshionVSFatshion,2pyk3k,eggplantt,3,Sun Dec 21 12:42:15 2014 UTC,"Because you have to have an actual hourglass figure to pull off most ""pin-up"" styles. Big tits + big ass =/= hourglass, because they usually don't take their gut into account. That dress could look less awful on someone who was overweight but with a true hourglass figure. Fat girls look at pictures of healthy models in online stores and assume that's exactly what the clothes will look like on them."

FitshionVSFatshion,2pyk3k,AbstractDiarrhea,1 point,Sun Dec 21 15:47:27 2014 UTC,"I don't believe I did show sympathy for her.  I merely said that she looks better than other people of her size.  She doesn't look good.  But she doesn't have to look gorgeous for this to be a smart marketing move.  She just has to be more attractive than most people of her size.  Which she pretty objectively is.  That doesn't make her actually attractive.  Just that she looks better by comparison.  A nice piece of salmon is more attractive to me than a pile of dog food, but I still think both are gross and I would prefer to never eat either one.  Everything in this world is measured in degrees.  You can say all fat people are gross.  They are.  But if you are being 100% percent honest with yourself, you will admit that some are more gross than others  My main point was that the OP's line of ""Is this how they expect to entice people to buy their items?"" is silly.  This is good marketing on the company's part.  Are they going to alienate people like OP who apparently can't ever buy something if they've seen a fat person where something similar?  Apparently so.  But they can bring in a lot more buyers by having a plus size model, especially if she is less gross than the average fat person.  So hating on their business model like OP is doing just makes a person seem stupid.  Fat people exist.  Companies are going to try to sell to them.  Get over it."

FitshionVSFatshion,2pyk3k,crispgreen,7,Sun Dec 21 18:57:53 2014 UTC,"As a thin person, I immediately decided against buying the dress because of how gross it looked on the whale.    Every single article of clothing is going to look bad on them.  So do you just not buy anything that ever comes in larger sizes in addition to your own?  Or only when a company has the audacity to try to market to obese people in addition to thin people?  I hate to break it to you, but there are a lot of fat people out there.  Go ahead and hate the fat people.  But hating on companies for trying to get those people to spend money at their store is just ridiculous."
FitshionVSFatshion,2pyk3k,theaveragemuffin,-1,Sun Dec 21 13:19:49 2014 UTC,"Because, also objectively, she is most likely more attractive than a lot of others of her size.   Objectively, they're all disgusting. If I were a mod, I'd give you a warning for this post."

Luckily I can do that without being a mod too.  Of course she is disgusting.  I didn't say otherwise.  But if you would be objective, you would be able to say that she looks better than a lot of others of her size.  My whole point is that this was a company trying to make money.  So yes, this is how they entice bigger people to buy their clothes."

Tess is sporting an accordion fabric; also known as squeeze box fabric. Initial sizing of the fabric left plenty of surplus material between ridges for when The Monster was just tiny at only 260 lb. Now that she is pushing and passing 400 lb, the fabric is starting to flatten out.  Also note, Tess is only casually cinching the waist, so there is no waist to speak of. For that to happen, a full blown titanium/kevlar reinforced corset needs to be worn; I guess hers was out on loan or something."

FitshionVSFatshion,2mw2is,PudgePlugger,1 point,Tue Dec 2 04:37:30 2014 UTC,"Definitely! Clothing has been appropriated from different sources since the dawn of clothing. Example: Pea coats, which are worn all the time (Honestly, the black pea coat is kind of becoming the fedora of coats) was originally a coat designed for the Navy.  I personally spent a little bit extra on my boat shoes, but it was more for comfort because they're lined with deerskin leather (super soft) and the insole is made of memory foam, so it's like walking on a cloud.  Plus, with boat shoes designed, well, for walking on the deck of a boat, they've got tons of grip so they're great even when it's wet."

I'm not really one to own more than one pair of shoes at a time, so I'd like something that I can do everything in. Things like jogging and hiking or business casual. I guess my concern is that they wouldn't have a tight enough fit for an active person and would be better for just wearing around town."
FitshionVSFatshion,2mw2is,KIAA0319,1 point,Tue Dec 2 05:31:08 2014 UTC,"Man, you're really looking for a single shoe that can do too much. If it's gonna be good for hiking/jogging, it's not gonna work in a business casual settings (which is generally slacks & a button up, so a leather, or faux leather dress shoe would be best). Jogging & hiking tend to require two different terrains, so another pair would be better for each situation. Unfortunately, sometimes you gotta knuckle down and buy extra shoes.  The thing about having more than one pair at a time, though, means that they'll last longer because you get to let the shoe breath more often, letting it get rid of the sweat, and you also get the added bonus of them not stinking.  Even before I was into fashion, I had my skate shoes, my running shoes, my cleats for football, and my dress shoes."
FitshionVSFatshion,2mw2is,Adip0se,1 point,Tue Dec 2 05:35:50 2014 UTC,"I used to have a nice pair of ""hiking"" shoes that were leather and looked great with business casual clothing. They were also light enough that I could jog in them without hurting my feet/legs.   They really were a great gift from the shoe gods except one minor flaw: They didn't even last a year. Haha. They were pretty cheaply made and the outsole just came right off."
FitshionVSFatshion,2mw2is,KIAA0319,1 point,Tue Dec 2 05:39:46 2014 UTC,"Haha damn, that sucks.  I'm really not even suggesting something super fashionable. Even with function, a shoe that's designed to be a sort of hybrid ""all in one"" tends to be pretty terrible for all of the functions that it's a hybrid of. You could go down to Target or (dare I say) Walmart to find some cheap shoes that will work for what you need. Grab some cheap tennis shoes for running/jogging, some cheap boots for hiking, and some cheap dress shoes for business casual needs. It'll save you in the long run.  And honestly, the quotation marks probably should've been around the word ""leather"" than the word hiking, because they were probably made with ""genuine leather"" which is kind of like the particle board of leather (just bits that were chopped up super fine and glued together and tends to fall apart quickly)."
FitshionVSFatshion,2mw2is,Kestral,1 point,Tue Dec 2 05:43:53 2014 UTC,"That's probably true. Given the rest of the shoe, I highly doubt it could be considered a true leather shoe.  Another dumb question: Do people still buy shoes that last long enough and look good enough that they have the shoes resoled when they start wearing out? It's something I've been kind of curious about and might be interested in trying, but I haven't cared enough to actually look into it, yet."
FitshionVSFatshion,2mw2is,ShortWarrior,1 point,Tue Dec 2 05:46:47 2014 UTC,"Yup! I have a few pairs that do that and the Insurance agency where I work is right next door to a cobbler (someone who repairs shoes). I'm about to take a pair of cowboy boots that I thrifted for $20 there to be resoled. He's charging me $60 for it (normally he charges $70) and he's throwing in some polish for me for free haha. But with a good pair of shoes, that $70 re-soling would only be necessary once every few years as long as you take care of them.

Due to moving, I had to give away most of my goth-style stuff and it burns me to see the delicate/lacy/cute or military-inspired goth fatshion. It is the same with the Lolita/dolly stuff. It was never intended for this body type, you are doing a disservice to the fashion by wearing it. So thank you for posting.  First pic: your outfit choice is better due to the top. With the big top she has, it looks frumpy instead of goth or punk.   Second pic: I love your shirt here, the sleeves are great and add sophistication to this. Her thick sweater was clunky.   Third pic: I do like her dress more but of course we have to make due with what we have (no one here is going to buy clothes for this side hobby). I like your dress and I like those sleeves, just not together. I really like them, actually. That dress is adorable."

Part of the idea of this style (at least for me) is a reminder that there is a dark side to life and instead of fearing it we should recognize it. We will all die, and that's part of what makes life precious and beautiful. Being obese wearing this sends me a mixed message, one of gluttony and death, of pure indulgence that ruins the appreciation of life and the ignorance of death. Having visible bone and sinew adds to the delicacy. The blue or black lipstick can remind one of death, and with a slender body this can look more ""raw human"" as opposed to ""bloated corpse"".

For hair to absorb protein it needs to have a molecular weight of 350-500 Daltons. You can achieve this color with out over processing with a simple formula of 66/46 + 77/44 kyle soon perfect @ 12% for those with dark hair or 9% for those with medium hair or 6% for those with light to medium hair or 3% for those with blonde hair.

FitshionVSFatshion,2k7gqk,PopsRacer,2,Fri Oct 24 20:14:13 2014 UTC,"I had to play around with it a bit. First off, I don't have that color lipstick, so I used the same dark color on my eye (the eyeshadow) as a base for the lip, then topped it with creamy purple lip tint. I thought the color came out well so I didn't want to tone it down too much. For the eye, I kept adjusting it to make it look more like the source picture but I just couldn't do it because I thought it would look too much like ""spooky clown"" and less ""spooky"". It's the same reason I didn't add a bunch to the bottom outside the lip area, I thought that half-circle bottom lip looks clownish."
FitshionVSFatshion,2k7gqk,RedhairedLemur,2,Sat Oct 25 03:45:25 2014 UTC,"See, I think it'd look good either or. Play up your eyes or your lips.  The lips would look neat with plain eyes (just tons of mascara and maybe a little black liner) and the yes would look neat with a nude/neutral lip, but together it feels too much.  Unless it was an outright costume, which it doesn't seem to be.  Edited to add: Oh! Also it what was bugging me, the eyes seem to be done in 'warm' (browns/oranges) tones, while the lips are cool (blues and purples) just seems unbalanced to me.  If you paired the lipstick at the left with the eye at the right, it might look vampy and dramatic, but not so much as all on the left.  Likewise, pair the eyes on the right with the lip on the left, same deal!"

FitshionVSFatshion,2jlqvz,117or163,2,Sat Oct 18 15:13:09 2014 UTC,"You might be right. Beyonce always looked fat to me, but it's probably because I can't stand her as a singer."

FitshionVSFatshion,2jlqvz,anotherboleyn,11,Sat Oct 18 14:00:51 2014 UTC,"If the women on YBG are being honest, this is what a BMI of 19 looks like: one, two, and three. Beyonce looks, uh... not like that.  How you look at certain weights depends on your bone structure, frame (small-framed girls look better at lower weights), fat distribution, and muscle mass. I don't want to impose on you, but if you're happy with your body - great, if you're not - change it. I don't think that basing how you feel about your body on how celebrities look (especially the obnoxious and tacky ones like Beyonce) is very constructive."
FitshionVSFatshion,2jlqvz,mlkt,9,Sat Oct 18 14:20:35 2014 UTC,What? How is saying that how fat you look depends on your bf% suspicious?
FitshionVSFatshion,2jlqvz,mlkt,8,Sat Oct 18 15:11:07 2014 UTC,"Saying ""How you look at certain weights depends on your bone structure, frame, fat distribution, and muscle mass."" is different from saying ""I'm not really fat, it's bone structure"" or ""I'm just big-framed tee-hee"" . Like, two girls can have the same weight but if the first one works her ass off at the gym and the second one doesn't, guess who's gonna look fatter? That's what I'm saying  What I meant is   If you're less muscular and more flabby, you'll look fatter Fat distribution is a thing. Some women, for example, pack more weight on their stomach rather than on their thighs/ass, which makes them look fatter"
FitshionVSFatshion,2jlqvz,mlkt,7,Sat Oct 18 15:23:57 2014 UTC,"I didn't take offense... I just think that this sub (and FPH too) is for reals, not feels. Like I don't think that we have some sort of a crazy ideology or anything, we're just saying what most other people are thinking. So if what I'm saying is reals, then it doesn't matter if FAs try to use some skewed version of what I'm saying as excuses."
FitshionVSFatshion,2jlqvz,mlkt,23,Sat Oct 18 16:40:34 2014 UTC,My favorite part as a make wasn't just that she's a fatty delusional about Beyonce but that the clothes weren't even close to similar. A male noticed patterns on a skirt. And they weren't close. She MUST be delusional
FitshionVSFatshion,2jlqvz,steveryans,9,Sat Oct 18 17:33:21 2014 UTC,"does being fat make you delusional, or does being delusional make you eat all the food?  the world may never know"

I had never skipped school before and somehow my friends convinced me to.  We drove to Atlanta in my friend's VW Van which had no heat.  It was the winter and pretty cold.  My two friends were in the front and I just slept the whole way on the back of the van, buried under all our clothes and stuff to stay warm.  Later, we stopped from some gas and the van conked out.  We had to push it out of the street.  It ran up the back of my ankle and really hurt me pretty bad.  I had to hop on one foot the rest of the night.  It wasn't so bad at the show, but the MARTA station was really crowded and we were all in a hurry.  L7 and The Breeders opened.  I hadn't heard L7 before but they were pretty good.  I saw both at Lollapaloza later on.  Nirvana played a great show, I really enjoyed it.  It was my first big concert, so I didn't have many expectations.  Towards the end, you could tell they were kind of worn out."

FitshionVSFatshion,2itz3j,alc0,10,Fri Oct 10 07:18:09 2014 UTC,"I'm aware of the lack of logic. I made a post recently titled *Hey Obese People: They Just Want Your Money. It explained that the FA/HAES crowd shuns ""Big Diet"" (the diet industry) for preying on their insecurities to make money (""You're fat and that's unacceptable; give me money for a product to help you lose fat and become socially acceptable.""). This is why ""Big Diet"" is evil... ...except the Fat Acceptance movement does the same thing. The Militant Baker quit her job and asked people to donate money to her to support her blog and therefore her lifestyle. They sell books, cater to fat fashion (fatshion), special ""real people"" portions at restaurants, and so on...which means they're preying on insecurities to make money (""You're fat and fabulous! Give me money so I can make you feel better about being fat and highlight your fabulousness!"")  Then I offer free personal training, and tell them to fuck the assholes trying to exploit them for money.  One Tumblrina decided that was evil and tried to tell me that I am judgmental (lol, hypocrisy) and a bad person because I don't coddle fat people. She referenced FPH, which I already referenced in a linked post, so it's not like I was hiding anything. I asked her what her point was since she was expressing hate for someone and what she ""called out"" was something I already ""called out"" on myself. She deleted the posts, made a new post, and another one called me an asshole.   Par for the course, I guess. I'm just so intrigued at how the brain works to protect itself."

FitshionVSFatshion,2iroym,heyisthatadam,1 point,Thu Oct 9 18:56:03 2014 UTC,Ironic means unexpected coincidence. If this chick is an FA then I think it's to be expected that she would make fatshion choices based around having 'curves'.  It's definitely amusing but not unexpected and almost definitely 100% intentional.
FitshionVSFatshion,2iroym,prettyskinnybones,1 point,Wed Oct 15 06:07:19 2014 UTC,I love those (your) shorts! Any idea where I can get a pair or similar?
FitshionVSFatshion,2ird7l,TheToastTot,39,Thu Oct 9 14:09:26 2014 UTC,They think that sizes 12-24 is curvy. No wonder they think we have ED's.

This would also show that we honor progress and a positive change and this would estabilsh our blog as a positive inspiraton blog, we could also fake some asks if possible about weightloss where the mods will answer the usual shit (eat well and work out) so they really really have nothing they could say would lead to eating disorders....

Anything over 150 and I look like a fatty fat fat, but I am still in the 'normal BMI' range for my height.  Because the 'normal BMI' is a range of weights, people who fall into the upper range of 'normal' are still considered as normal as people who fall into the lower range of weights.

He probably can't button it because his neck is too fat and is trying to play it off like it's a look he's going for. But shit, there are such things as collar button extenders and he would look so much better with one. One side of his collar is concave and the other side is convex because he is not wearing collar stays. That shirt is wrinkly as fuck. How much work is it really to either iron your shirt or at least hang it up on a hanger after you dry it?  Tie is tied wrong. The tip potrudes past the bottom edge of his belt buckle.  A tie bar is just not appropriate when the rest of the look is so sloppy and informal."

In fact if someone would photoshop my head onto one it wouldn't bother me in the slightest. I commend those ladies on their hard work and discipline.

This picture was taken a month ago, but I am a bit more muscular now. I'm fairly confident with the way I look - if someone tells me I'm ugly, I'd think they're stupid. I'm still healthy otherwise. If these fatshionistas are so confident and think they look good, this comparison subreddit shouldn't bother them. Like I said, for most of us, this is just entertainment."

FitshionVSFatshion,2ils7e,Frawg,3,Wed Oct 8 12:59:33 2014 UTC,"Dude, for real.  Such a tragedy in sexiness that a chick who has the tools to be easily a 7.5+ with a few tweaks settles for mediocrity.  She looks pretty short, too, meaning she doesn't wear the excess weight as well, but she probably doesn't need to lose as much absolute poundage.  Tightening up the diet and dropping a mere 20-25 lbs over the course of a few months would lean her out into a smoking hot hourglass figure, in which she'd likely keep some great cans and what I imagine is a round-ish ass, all while making her face more striking."
FitshionVSFatshion,2ils7e,OrangeJuliusPage,3,Wed Oct 8 21:22:00 2014 UTC,It'd be a huge transformation if she were to be normal sized - her face would have a completely different shape. Why can't she put all the effort that she puts into her clothes into making the rest of her pretty :(

Yes, she should lose some weight, and you probably shouldn't wear short skirts and crop tops when you're that big (it just looks vulgar) but to say that she is disgusting just because she is overweight is rude.   You are reducing someone's value to one characteristic, their weight. That's just as shallow as saying fat is beautiful.   You know what's beautiful? Health is beautiful. Kindness is beautiful. Cleanliness and good posture are beautiful. And missing out on one of those does not make you disgusting! We are all just tryin to do the best with what we have.   Don't be a mean girl, darling.

FitshionVSFatshion,2if5yc,c4lmlikeab0mb,1 point,Thu Oct 9 04:08:51 2014 UTC,I would personally say this is incorrect.  Fit has always been in reference to being athletic.  which would mean some sort of visible muscle mass from training in some way.  Quick google of fit body and I see thousands of pics of people with very definable muscle mass.  No thin only pics.     Many of the pics are very obviously not fit and just thin.  Sad thing is that's the sort of pics likely setting the tumblr up for another ED shutdown. :(

FitshionVSFatshion,2ie5go,Mirrorflute88,7,Tue Oct 7 21:16:47 2014 UTC,Yeah. They know that people notice the fat and they know that it's unattractive. They over accessorize and do everything else to compensate. They don't want to be the obese girl. They want to be the girl with purple hair or the nose piercing or the bright pink super thick framed glasses. Anything to take away and hide the fat.

If anything, society wants you to shove some more McDonalds in your face. And how is anyone ""oppressing"" you when you publicly share fashion images and they end up on a fashion blog?

It's a goddamned double standard that I'm fucking sick of hearing.  For every ""eat a fucking sandwich"" I've heard, I should be able to say ""put down the fucking burger"".  Wanting to be thin or fit is not an eating disorder, and telling people they should not strive for that is, you guessed it, body shaming!  Starving yourself to the point where your organs shut down and your bones become brittle?  Now THATS disordered eating.  But so is eating so much that your organs shut down and your bones risk breaking due to the extreme stress you're putting on it.  We need to stop coddling these people and start treating obesity as the eating disorder that it is."

So what's happening here? I'm significantly thinner than the 5'6 140lbs comment, and I fit comfortably into a Small most of the time. XS tends to be tight in the bust and arms.

As far as the pants, I have pants ranging in size from 2-8 from there that all fit reasonably well. I kind of like a baggy loose fit for some pants though, so I buy ones that are technically too big.

I always cringe hearing fat people complaining they don't find their size: guess what, I don't either, but when I complain, it's thin privilege. Or some other bs to that extent."
FitshionVSFatshion,2i8d4v,supizky,1 point,Thu Oct 9 09:02:27 2014 UTC,"In Finland supermarkets seem to use vanity sizing in their own brands. That may be because their cheap clothes are popular with land whales (""Hey, I can buy 2 kilos of ice cream AND new pants to fit my front butt!!!!"").  On a regular clothing store like H&M I'm usually somewhere between sizes S or M (I'm a short guy).  In supermarkets like Citymarket or Prisma it's hard for me to find any clothes that are small enough. Their ""small"" is usually way bigger than H&M's medium or even large, and their jeans sizes start at 32"" or 34"" waist, no smaller pants available!"

It's so flattering and feminine on a human shaped body :)  It looks so great if you have a flat stomach and you can afford a dress with a sort of stiff fabric that stands out so it accentuates the difference between your waist and hips :)
FitshionVSFatshion,2hs4aq,PrinceOWales,3,Mon Sep 29 12:03:25 2014 UTC,Where did you get that dress?!
FitshionVSFatshion,2hs4aq,Fatshionista,3,Mon Sep 29 13:48:49 2014 UTC,I bought this at Vista Village in the UK about 2 years ago. It is a dress from Armani (outlet) and the quality of it is fantastic :)  The size of this one when I tried it on was weird though. I usually wear a 00/XS (even though I am actually an S!)

FitshionVSFatshion,2hqy1n,-ILikePie-,5,Thu Nov 20 22:24:28 2014 UTC,.... Why not blur out the tattoos?
FitshionVSFatshion,2hqy1n,Zombawesome,4,Mon Sep 29 01:55:43 2014 UTC,Because I put a lot of money in them so I'm going to show them off
FitshionVSFatshion,2hqy1n,ShortWarrior,2,Mon Sep 29 02:02:54 2014 UTC,"And they are lovely, might I add?"
FitshionVSFatshion,2hqy1n,ShortWarrior,4,Mon Sep 29 02:03:28 2014 UTC,You may. I have one on the other side of my left arm (AZ state w/ flag arm) that is the biggest too
FitshionVSFatshion,2hqy1n,-ILikePie-,2,Mon Sep 29 02:04:27 2014 UTC,"Unrelated, but can I borrow the az tattoo? I've been wanting an az related tattoo and I think it's perfect."

FitshionVSFatshion,2hribz,shadybrainfarm,3,Wed Oct 1 02:11:52 2014 UTC,"Fuck, I don't have coloured leggings…"
FitshionVSFatshion,2hribz,shadybrainfarm,2,Wed Oct 1 02:29:51 2014 UTC,"The time is now. I have so many leggings. God damn I love leggings. Cause I'm always so cold, haha."
FitshionVSFatshion,2hr53q,ShortWarrior,3,Mon Sep 29 02:41:52 2014 UTC,You look so adorable shitlady! Keep it up!
FitshionVSFatshion,2hr53q,imaterriblelurker,2,Mon Sep 29 18:32:51 2014 UTC,"The pose really says so much. You can pretend to be confident of your ""beautiful fat body"" all you want, but they always pose with their toes turned in and all squinched up (that's a word, totally).  You look confident and great. Continue on."

FitshionVSFatshion,2hqp25,heyisthatadam,10,Sun Sep 28 23:54:57 2014 UTC,Goodwill.
FitshionVSFatshion,2hqp25,ShortWarrior,6,Mon Sep 29 01:17:42 2014 UTC,Found this for inspiration: http://chubstr.com/tag/submissions/
FitshionVSFatshion,2hqp25,117or163,5,Mon Sep 29 01:45:25 2014 UTC,Perfect
FitshionVSFatshion,2hqp25,completelytrustworth,2,Mon Sep 29 01:47:58 2014 UTC,Sweet!  I'll have to look through this
FitshionVSFatshion,2hqp25,shmuklidooha,3,Thu Oct 2 04:17:42 2014 UTC,Walk around with your shirt off.
FitshionVSFatshion,2hqp25,ShortWarrior,7,Mon Sep 29 00:02:59 2014 UTC,"Already do, but what fat person is going to do that. Plus it says no nudes"
FitshionVSFatshion,2hqp25,-ILikePie-,5,Mon Sep 29 00:06:25 2014 UTC,"As long as you're wearing pants and you're a dude, I'm fine with it."
FitshionVSFatshion,2hqp25,imaterriblelurker,6,Mon Sep 29 01:18:14 2014 UTC,No nudes means no dangly bits. Post shirtless in the same pose
FitshionVSFatshion,2hqp25,-ILikePie-,10,Mon Sep 29 00:48:43 2014 UTC,I bet you'd like that. Perv  Edit: jk
FitshionVSFatshion,2hqp25,ShortWarrior,5,Mon Sep 29 00:50:51 2014 UTC,Yes. We would like that. :)
FitshionVSFatshion,2hqp25,-ILikePie-,3,Mon Sep 29 10:21:59 2014 UTC,"Oh, you know it. Pervy and proud"
FitshionVSFatshion,2hqp25,shmuklidooha,6,Mon Sep 29 00:53:09 2014 UTC,"Yep, I'm fine with shirtless men. :3"
FitshionVSFatshion,2hqp25,ihatefattymcfatties,2,Mon Sep 29 01:18:37 2014 UTC,Seconded!
FitshionVSFatshion,2hqp25,wh40k_Junkie,6,Mon Sep 29 01:32:54 2014 UTC,"Plus it says no nudes   Wear a wife beater? Dunno, just be swole and get the hot chicks. You'll piss off all the 'nice guy' neckbeard types."
FitshionVSFatshion,2hqp25,Allforthe2nd,5,Mon Sep 29 00:09:00 2014 UTC,"I'm not a douche though. The only time I wear sleeveless is at the gym and that's so I have full mobility of my arms. So far I'm doing pretty well at being swole and getting the hot chicks, though I am one of those 'nice guys', not a fucking neckbeard though. But that doesn't help with the question at hand"
FitshionVSFatshion,2hqp25,Allforthe2nd,3,Mon Sep 29 00:14:54 2014 UTC,Send me thousands of photos of fat dudes wearing tank top/vests/wife beaters. Comparisons will follow.
FitshionVSFatshion,2hqp25,-ILikePie-,1 point,Mon Sep 29 19:16:10 2014 UTC,"I can do trailer trash. Most of my ""at home lounge"" clothes seems ripped out of sunnyvale"
FitshionVSFatshion,2hqp25,imaterriblelurker,2,Thu Oct 2 14:13:17 2014 UTC,"I tried googling 'fat guys in pajama pants' since that's what I currently have on. All I saw was ripped dudes. You're a shitlord, Google!"
FitshionVSFatshion,2hqp25,imaterriblelurker,3,Mon Sep 29 00:04:07 2014 UTC,Same! There was a few pictures of me too. Darn :P
