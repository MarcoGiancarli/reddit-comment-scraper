brownbeauty,3e6ig8,Gandhis_revenge,2,Wed Jul 22 09:41:51 2015 UTC,I find darker lipsticks look way better on me when I'm tanned!
brownbeauty,3e6ig8,currently_typing,2,Wed Jul 22 11:13:18 2015 UTC,"LOL I thought you were asking what my tanning routine was. I was gonna say, ""slap on some high spf sunscreen and hope I only get two shades darker instead of 40.""   but no when I'm tan, I just stick with no foundation (i find my skin tone evens out more in the summer-- maybe because I'm generally drinking more water? I dunno) highlighter, a very warm contour and filled in brows!"
brownbeauty,3e6ig8,chiffonandheels,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:25:06 2015 UTC,"Lighter layers of my usual highlighting/undereye concealer under pressed powder foundation; since I'm tanning in the summer there's no way I'm walking out with a lot of cream or liquid products on my greasy face so I opt for just highlighting (LA Girl Pro Concealer in Fawn) and then applying my NYX Stay Matte Not Flat pressed powder in Nutmeg with a puff all over to stop the oil. I do my usual silicone primer and setting spray as well.  In terms of other makeup, I enjoy wearing bright colors more because the darker your skin the more those colors stand out and look beautiful IMO."
brownbeauty,3e406b,c3bysparrow,3,Tue Jul 21 19:56:58 2015 UTC,"So I've decided to leave any swatches of lipsticks I've destashed in for reference (for myself and others), but I got them in near color order. I will admit that KVD Bow N Arrow looks very light in the swatch, but I think that's from lighting and it being a close up. Other photos of my with it on have it sitting as a nice nude.  Feel free to ask questions."

brownbeauty,3e406b,lilylolalu,2,Tue Jul 21 23:11:43 2015 UTC,"It's actually my least favorite since it's water soluble to make it more comfortable (according to the owner), but that means even light eating and drinking can ruin it and require reapplication. Also it's a bit flakey and the time it takes from ordering to actually receiving the product is way too long. It has a nice price point and the color is super unique though."

brownbeauty,3e30nb,moonjongup,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:21:07 2015 UTC,"For foundation brushes, I use the Sigma F80 flat top kabuki or this Sephora pro fan brush that has many bristles. I also really like using a beauty blender depending on the formula I'm using!"
brownbeauty,3e30nb,moonjongup,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:59:10 2015 UTC,And these brushes are good for full coaverage? And what do you mean by formula? Which formula feel best for beauty blender usage?
brownbeauty,3e30nb,MintyLotus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:09:14 2015 UTC,"So if I'm using my Kat Von D foundation, I'd probably use my beauty blender because the finish looks a lot more natural and still remains full coverage. But if I were using a thinner formula, like Mac Studio Fix Fluid, I'd use my Sigma Flat Top Kabuki because it will give the best coverage. I find that brushes (like the f80) give fuller coverage and a beauty blender can  sheer some lighter coverage foundations out."

This is finally a collection [since I've been into makeup, anyway] from MAC that I can look forward to seeing and might actually make a purchase."
brownbeauty,3dos1o,spicychamp,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:44:53 2015 UTC,Pop the pot into your bra for a few minutes before you use it and always cover the orange with something skin tone that is pigmented enough. A be cream probably can't cover pure orange but most concealer a will. Since you will be adding 2 layers make sure you're using as little product as possible
brownbeauty,3dos1o,beautylit,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:12:42 2015 UTC,Thanks! So you're saying that I shouldn't blend the orange out before putting the concealer on top? When I blend it out it basically seems to disappear.
brownbeauty,3dos1o,beautylit,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:23:13 2015 UTC,If you can warm it up it should apply easier. The whole idea of it is to spot correct so concentrate it where you need it using as little as possible. Then blend the concealer over it.
brownbeauty,3dos1o,frumperbell,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:37:08 2015 UTC,"If it's really that dry and hard to blend, try using a damp Beauty Blender or sponge to apply it."
brownbeauty,3dos1o,sodium18,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:25:40 2015 UTC,"I've tried that but since the corrector isn't that saturated/pigmented (at least against darker skin), using a beauty blender seems to make it disappear with no effect on the undereye circles. :( I might be doing something completely wrong though. but thanks!"
brownbeauty,3dos1o,chiffonandheels,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:24:13 2015 UTC,I use the mac correcting duo in burnt orange and yellow.  I use the tiniest amount of orange in the parts that are blue under my eyes. Only the blue parts and then I use a regular concealer and then yellow on top.  I keep all the layers super thin and finish with setting powder. I've got really severe dark circles and the orange helps a lot but you have to use a super tiny amount
brownbeauty,3dos1o,RubberDuckuZilla,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:14:28 2015 UTC,oh man the burnt coral/yellow correcting duo looks much creamier and easier to use than the corrector I bought. How do you use the yellow on top of concealer/what does it do? Is it kind of like setting with banana powder? I've never heard of that!
brownbeauty,3dos1o,RubberDuckuZilla,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:17:04 2015 UTC,"Do you have a mixing palette at all? If the product is dry, try mixing it with a concealer that's close to your skin tone.   I use NYX pure orange to correct my really dark brown undereye circles all the time, so this should work! My sister uses almost exclusively mac products and when I do her makeup for her (we both suffer from really dark brown eye circles) the orange is the perfect shade. She's a NC45 for reference."
brownbeauty,3dos1o,ibby_be,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:59:15 2015 UTC,"I do not, but I'll find something and try that! I'm thinking mixing with the NARS RCC which is thick but still liquidy and blendable.  I have been on the lookout for the NYX pure orange corrector foreverrr. ulta doesn't sell it, I haven't seen it in stores, and it's usually sold out on the NYX website, but it looks like it isn't now. I'll definitely put it on my mental list of good concealer products."
brownbeauty,3dp69e,abird-eyeview,5,Sat Jul 18 02:57:14 2015 UTC,Just a personal preference but I'm the same shade as you and I definitely prefer the pressed version of opal to tjr rose gold pressed version. Idk the pink tone in it really turned me off whereas opal is fool proof
brownbeauty,3dp69e,Brompton_Cocktail,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:08:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your input, it's super helpful :) I have a feeling Opal looked nicer too, because the Rose Gold looked nice in store, but not so much when I came back home and tried it for myself. I'm definitely leaning towards getting Opal now. BTW: I'm just going off your username, but are you from Brampton, ON?"

brownbeauty,3dnk56,journalistwannabe,4,Fri Jul 17 18:48:51 2015 UTC,"I go from oily in the winter to ""Oil Spill in the Gulf"" oily in the summer. The truth is, you probably will get some oil break through.  The difference is whether you can go at least 6 or so hours before you need to blot a little shine away, or if you look in the mirror after a few hours and think ""yknow what, I'm just gonna wash my face and take a nap now, because I look like Clayface and that shit's not cute.""  What works for me (and of course YMMV):   Maybelline FIT Me is not oily friendly.  I think I got about 3 hours out of before my face went full oil slick when I tested it out in the spring, when my skin is usually not that bad.  I won't even imagine how bad it would fail in the summer.  What works best for me in the summer is CG Queen 3 in 1 and L'Oreal's new Infallible foundation.  L'Oreal's True Match Superblendable isn't bad either; I personally don't like it because it has more of a dewy finish than I'd like, but it has one of the best shade ranges at the drugstore. On days when it's really humid out, I do the Goss Method: basically you put translucent powder on UNDER your foundation, apply foundation as usual, and (depending on how oily/paranoid you are) then set with powder.  I like Black Opal's Loose Oil Blocking Powder for under my foundation and L'Oreal's Infallible Powder or Blackbird's Magic Trick Powder in Orange to set my face.  If you're really worried, you can finish with setting spray.  I like NYX's Matte Spray. Higher end foundations that I've seen rec'd for oily skin are Kat Von D's Lock It and MUFE Mat Velvet.  I personally haven't tried them because unfortunately their concealers broke me out.  Still, you can always go in and ask for samples so you can patch test because again YMMV."
brownbeauty,3dnk56,frumperbell,2,Sat Jul 18 14:24:11 2015 UTC,"Neutrogena has a powder and primer that has rice protein in it that really helps with controlling the order. It's anywhere from $10-15. You can find it at WalMart, Target, Ulta, etc."
brownbeauty,3dnk56,E-n-Mack,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:42:40 2015 UTC,"To keep oil at bay I use the Shiseido Pureness mattifying moisturizer, nyx pore filler primer (I've also used Tarte's primer and really liked it), Ben Nye powder for under my eyes, CG powder foundation for bronzing, and UD all nighter spray to set it all.  Even though I do most of those things daily I do have several different foundations and that can really make a difference. For example I can use all those same steps with my Becca ultimate coverage liquid foundation and need to blot before lunch but My Revlon colorstay whipped foundation has done the best with keeping oiliness at bay."
brownbeauty,3dnk56,Selenashines,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:03:21 2015 UTC,"I suffer from oily skin year-round. Here's what I use to help curb it:  -Garnier Nutritioniste Moisture Rescue Refresher Gel -Cream in the mornings, after i've scrubbed my face  -Smashbox's Photo Finish Foundation Primer underneath all my makeup  -NYX's Matte Bronzer in ""MBB05 - Deep Tan""  -NYX's Matte Finish Long-Lasting Setting Spray  With a combination of all of those, and some light blotting throughout the day with some blotting paper, you should be fine!"

brownbeauty,3dm0ru,Elaasi,9,Fri Jul 17 10:36:47 2015 UTC,With hyper pigmentation the answer always generally leans to color correction. I think maybe a peach toned corrector (look into the Bobbi brown ones) should be a staple in every brown girls kit since hyper  pigmentation is so prevalent with darker skin
brownbeauty,3dm0ru,Brompton_Cocktail,5,Fri Jul 17 12:06:03 2015 UTC,"Like /u/Brompton_Cocktail said, a good peach/orange toned colour correcting concealer is a good place to start. Wearing it under your foundation, makes it less obvious. Another option is a good full coverage foundation (studio fix fluid etc) that matches the rest of your face, and covers the dark areas, again the peach toned concealer underneath would make it look more even toned.  The other way is actually trying to brighten your skin through skincare products targeted specifically for that purpose. /r/SkincareAddiction is a good resource to start off with!"
brownbeauty,3dm0ru,RubberDuckuZilla,3,Fri Jul 17 13:41:37 2015 UTC,"Ambi Fade Cream.  It's amazing.  It destroys Aunt Bunny's Mustache.  And it's five freaking dollars.  FYI though, if you don't use sunscreen, it WILL come back."

brownbeauty,3dj73j,Anne_of_Avonlea,5,Thu Jul 16 18:27:15 2015 UTC,"I love the way you did two looks and your blending is awesome, but the shadows are seriously way too cool for warm skin.   I just hate that these products almost explicitly don't even try to target darker people. I mean, Kat is really really light herself, so I guess these palettes are meant to be used as flattering shades on people of her skin tone. :/"

So far I like the palette, I have the 1 &2 as well. I use the 2 the most so we'll see if I use this in conjunction with it.  This was one of the looks on the insert, they have like 4 looks it's pretty cool.  But overall it's a fun palette. And not that packaging is super important but the case is stunning. Best case out of all of them."
brownbeauty,3dkrwl,-cutestofborg-,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:34:48 2015 UTC,"Your blending and general technique looks so good for someone who is a bit new! I'm no expert myself, but looking around at MUA and other subreddits and practicing on myself has helped.  I feel like with the really light colors, they make for good highlights just under the arch of your eyebrow and the inner corner of your eye.  Then a transition color (someone was just telling me about this) like a matte neutral a little closer to your skin tone before you get down to the crease.  Just an idea to play around with!  You pull off the smokey look so well though, it really suits your eyes."
brownbeauty,3djt5x,Thatonepandathing,2,Thu Jul 16 21:07:51 2015 UTC,Milani has really good blushes and baked bronzers. Colourpop does too. I pretty much swear by those two because it looks good on my skin but also cheap
brownbeauty,3djt5x,BrownSugaaaa,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:31:39 2015 UTC,We are the same complexion. I 100% recommend nars libert√© blush. It's described as a burnished apricot I believe. It comes off as a deep warm peachy rose. The finish is satin and it looks so natural. It matches everything because it just brightens your face rather than adding a load of color (which you could build it up for if you wanted). I would throw away all my other (4) blushes for this one honestly.
brownbeauty,3djt5x,beautylit,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:34:11 2015 UTC,I'm fairly new to blushes but I have really liked using MAC Lovejoy. I bought another blush and tried others but I keep reaching for Lovejoy instead.

brownbeauty,3def2a,shewh0mustnotbenamed,5,Wed Jul 22 03:04:45 2015 UTC,"I feel your pain! I seem to jump from a NC35 to NC45 during the summer.  But what it really comes down to is that sunscreen is only blocking the harmful UV rays from the sun so it's really only acting as a filter. From my understanding (and someone feel free to jump in and correct me!) this means you will still get tanned even with the best sunscreen. That being said, make sure you're using a full spectrum sunscreen and reapplying it often!"
brownbeauty,3def2a,ZooGirl,7,Wed Jul 15 17:08:27 2015 UTC,AFAIK if you're tanning you're not properly reapplying.
brownbeauty,3def2a,stufstuf,2,Wed Jul 15 17:18:22 2015 UTC,"Yup this - once I started wearing chemical sunscreen directly on my face and letting it ""set"" before putting on moisturizer or makeup, I stopped tanning as much during the summer. Currently using neutrogena dry touch and a la Roche Posay sunscreen. They're both spf50+ and pa++++, which is what I think makes the difference.  I still tan a little but NOWHERE near as much as I used to. Skincareaddictuon has some good Sunscreen recs and can explain the science better than I can."

I've been experimenting with how much to add to foundation and finally have a foundation (well its BB cream) that matches me perfectly. No ashyness, no too orangeness.  I have a bb cream and tinted moisturiser from Bobbie Brown which is supposed to be one of the more yellow based face stuff makeup brands around, but still not enough for me. Recently I've been looking at adjusters (before I discovered the solution in my own make up box) and MUFE Chromatic adjusters looked the best. They have oil or water based ones in a bunch of colours, and when I have some money next I'll be heading to a store to try them out.   So to make sure I get the closest match I always make sure I get the sort of coverage I'd use normally (I go with minimal coverage just to even thing out a bit). Then I take a mirror and walk out the store and look in natural daylight. Also I'll take some selfies outaide just as it's gone on and an hour or so later to see if it's oxidised.   I can't really comment on affordable options, as I went for Bobbie Brown as at the time it was the yellowest I could get out of the box. When they run out I'll be trying thr TKB pigment or MUFE type adjusters with drug store options (possibly Sleek)."

Makeup looks fine in the morning, you walk past a reflective surface and are like, ""damn, well that oxidized quick"".   I'm a beginner too. I look at it this way: you have to have the bad days to improve. How are you going to know what does and doesn't work otherwise? For me, conventional tips from beauty gurus just never work. I have to come up with my own ways to overcome issues. And the only way I can do this is by knowing what doesn't work.   Also returning stuff makes me feel better. Don't hold onto stuff that doesn't work.   Also, yes, the whole Ellen Pao thing annoys me as well. It has gotten way out of hand in my opinion. But that's a whole other bag of worms."

And it goes the other way too, like if I'm feeling ok but I do my makeup and it looks shitty, I end up wiping it all off, being late for work anyways, and just feeling ugly and grumpy.  I think for me the best time to try makeup is when I have lots of time, I'm feeling creative, and I don't have to go anywhere. And I keep trying to tell myself that if it's not perfect the first few times, that's okay. Everyone has to start somewhere.  (p.s.

You could ask for a sample so you can try it in natural light to get as close a match as possible. I heard good things about krylon as well which is incredibly budget friendly(haven't had a chance to see for myself).

brownbeauty,3cr3it,Lyannis,9,Fri Jul 10 02:31:42 2015 UTC,"First off, NEVER GIVE UP HOPE. There's something for everyone. I promise.   Secondly, have you tried findation.com? It's pretty good for helping people find matches based off of what foundations you already know you match in. Then you can just hunt those based on what kind of coverage you like. Honestly, it works better the more matches you have, and it doesn't have a complete database of types of foundation (it doesn't include the KVD Powder Foundation), but do try it. I plugged in that 155 Soft Honey and got some results for you: https://findation.com/searches/1627881   Thirdly, are you trying to match by yourself, or are you having a Sales Associate help you? I know Sephora pushes that Color IQ system, but try finding an associate who doesn't mind doing it the old fashioned way, matching against your neck or jaw. Just make sure you go outside to natural light (Sephora lighting is deceiving) and make sure it looks good. Make sure you're shopping at stores with good return policies, don't want to get stuck with mis matched makeup!"
brownbeauty,3cr3it,c3bysparrow,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:50:25 2015 UTC,"I have tried findation, but I put somewhat wrong shades (like the Maybelline bb cream in Medium Deep). Also, I don't know why, but my parents won't take me to sephora (I'm 17...)."
brownbeauty,3cr3it,c3bysparrow,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:18:39 2015 UTC,"Do you go out with friends and without your parents? Go then (with allies) and just find something you like, then ask your parents to buy it online from the brand's website. Also you can try Impluse Beauty within Macy's to try some of the brands that they have (Urban Decay, Too Faced, Tarte, etc) if your parents will allow that.  Yeah you don't want to plug in wrong foundations or you'll be the wrong results. Try some of the options they offer."
brownbeauty,3cr3it,maya_dave,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:43:35 2015 UTC,"Second this! Also be sure to grab samples of everything that seems to match you in store, and ensure that it still matches in natural light, after some time. That way you can see what it really looks like, and how it will oxidize on your skin. Sephora is really great with samples!   Also if price is an issue, then you may be able to use Sephora to help find your perfect match, and then search online for dupes (there is SO much out there right now). Also Sephora brand makeup items are a pretty good price point, and generally better quality than drugstores (YMMV though, and be sure to check out reviews). You may want to wait till summer is over to invest in a good foundation, in case your colour changes!"
brownbeauty,3cr3it,-cutestofborg-,3,Sun Jul 12 21:21:39 2015 UTC,"I can totally relate.  I'm in my 30s and have been lost since Prescriptives went away.  I was wearing MAC NC45 for a long time even though it didn't exactly match, because the coverage was pretty good, it wasn't crazy expensive, and it was accessible.  I recently rallied myself and went on another foundation search.  People gave me a lot of suggestions and I went into Sephora and tried a lot of things there.  Ultimately I ended up going with Estee Lauder Double Wear.  I love it! I mix it with Double Wear Maximum Coverage to get the coverage I really need.  Because let's face it, full coverage isn't really full for ladies like us.  I also use the DW concealer in a stick and like it a lot.  Here's the thread for my foundation search.  But I highly recommend trying DW! I do better with a neutral foundation, which they have.  Good luck! It's such a soul-sucking endeavour."
brownbeauty,3cr3it,BrownSugaaaa,2,Fri Jul 10 03:46:00 2015 UTC,I'm nc45 and that's pretty light already but are you matching yourself or having the people in the store match you? Also I've realized that brown girls have to do a lot more mixing which can be pretty costly. But try mixing with drugstore foundations which will be a lot cheaper.
brownbeauty,3cr3it,honeybuttery,2,Fri Jul 10 03:06:22 2015 UTC,"Foundation searches can be really daunting, but don't give up! It took me a long time before found a really, really good match, but it happened. Just explore different foundation and brands that you may not have looked at before. I'd recommend starting with Estee Lauder Double Wear, Lancome, and Bobbi Brown (BB foundations are for yellow undertones though). MUFE is also coming out with a reformulated HD foundation that's supposed to have a larger shade range, so that could be worth a second try.      If you want coverage for your acne scars, I would recommend spending some quality time learning how to color correct and conceal as well."
brownbeauty,3cr3it,Laylatae,2,Fri Jul 10 05:04:59 2015 UTC,"How are you matching foundations?  If you're swatching on your hand, then this might not be the best way as your hand is most likely a different colour from your face.  I've got hyperpigmentation on various parts of my face, so I make sure my foundation matches my jaw/neck, otherwise it looks super obvious I'm wearing the wrong foundation shade.   Keep looking! You will find a foundation shade, even if it means mixing some together."

brownbeauty,3cr3it,mcpagal,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:15:11 2015 UTC,"First, I thought I was nc42. Too light. Then nc44. Too dark. And then I looked at nc45, wayy too dark   I had this exact problem, then I discovered there's an NC43.5! I can't remember what foundation it was (maybe studio fix fluid, if that exists?) - I just got a little sample pot of it, but because I hardly wear liquid foundation, it's lasted months.  The problem I usually have with Mac is undertones - I'm warm yellow but not very warm, so things usually come out too orange/red on me. I've found that with powder foundation I get a much better match, like the Mac mineralise loose powder foundation in 'dark' I think."

Also- The UD 24hr Eyeliner- I can't tell, does it have a felt tip or a bristle tip?   Thanks for all the swatching! Jealous of your haul!"
brownbeauty,3cqbyj,now_in_the_know,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:09:46 2015 UTC,"Kiko is Italian, with make up shops in a lot of European countries and  few places in the US. I personally won't be bothering with their regular eyeshadows again as they looked chalky and didn't have much pigment, but their Infinity eyeshadows show up much better on me. Here in the UK they always seem to have sales on, so worth checking out. The store have tester of everything, so if you're near one I'd recommend going in to try stuff out.   The UD eyeliner is a bristle brush, it's not the worst bristle brush I've ever had in an eyeliner by far, but I've never had any where the bristles bent back on themselves after only a few uses, which could be to do with how I closed it but still annoying. I much prefer the Kiko style ones now (soft flexible but firm, felt, tapered).   My major qualm with this is the brush applicator, some of the bristle are all bent up already, and although it glides well it's harder to control the amount of product on the tip compared to my fav below [Kiko Super Colour Eyeliner].   YW :D, I hope some people can get an idea of some decent pigment stuff that shows up on (my admittedly paler end of the spectrum) brown skin."

brownbeauty,3coemp,Nela_7,23,Thu Jul 9 14:07:16 2015 UTC,"I think they want the sub to be more inclusive and not make people feel like they can't ask questions there if they have dark skin. Which I appreciate, though maybe not in the form of downvotes. I think it's fine to suggest this sub in addition to asking there, but to just tell someone to post somewhere else can make it seem like their question is not welcome there."
brownbeauty,3coemp,-cutestofborg-,37,Thu Jul 9 14:20:27 2015 UTC,"In my humble opinion, MUA likes to pretend it's an inclusive place (fairly militantly), but any time race (or anything that doesn't actually fit into their straight white female demographic) comes up it's a whole other story.   You'll find that posts with POC, particularly men of colour, tend to be highly upvoted with very few comments about how those looks could be improved. It's a fake inclusion, because, to me anyway, it feels like we're not really part of the community, more like we're being humoured or used to make other posters feel better. However, it is important to note that white people are less likely to know how to work with darker skintones (but I'd interject that it's not that hard to tell when someones contour needs blending, or their brows need work, or their eyeshadow looks muddy).  And the thing is, MUA's demographic doesn't just skew white. It skews 'pale'. This is fairly evident when looking at the recent post on natural looking blushes. Deep and medium tones put together got 31 suggestions in total. Pale tones got 70. There's practically a post every day on contouring shades for pale skin (which pisses me off mostly because of the fact that these people don't seem to know how to use the search bar). 'Pale' folk seem to feel like they're discriminated against, due to previous individual experience with bullying or being called Taylor Swift.   And that provides a bit of a barrier to me. Whilst I can intellectually understand that bullying is, of course, a horrible thing for people to go through, I can't understand how that is in any way comparable to not only the racism POC face from white people, but also comparable to the blatant shadism, colourism and racism that happens within our communities. I should note that I'm Bangladeshi, and I was born and bought up in Britain, which of course colours my opinion and my experience, but I know loads of south asians who like to brag about how 'pale' they are and how they're on 'team lightskin'.   I've heard conversations about how so-and-so will find it difficult to find a husband/wife because they're so dark. Every time someone goes abroad they bring back 'fair and lovely' because they believe that it will lighten their skin. For God's sake, my mom even used to watch a drama about how a beautiful girl had to hide her beauty, and how did she do that? Buy darkening her skin.   Like, the need to be light skinned has been pushed onto me since birth, and as I've grown up and read I've realised how wrong that is, I've become a bit jaded towards the pale white experience.   This has gone on a bit long and I've gone off on a tangent but my point is, I think that the conflict on MUA comes due to two different groups of people. It should be noted that I don't think everyone on MUA fits into either one of these groups of people, there are loads of groups. You have the pale people, who like to think well of themselves in that they believe they're inclusive, but also feel like they're a minority special snowflake because they're pale (they're not because, as I've already noted, MUA skews pale). And then you have the other group made up of mostly POC who, rightly or wrongly, tend to get frustrated at repeated mentions of how pale people have it bad, due to various reasons.   The thing is, there can never be an agreement. Pale people will generally look at it from an individualistic point of view, and those of us who are darker skinned will generally look at it from a more systematic point of view. So we're stuck at an impasse that is, for me anyway, incredibly frustrating.   I'm sorry, this isn't even answering your question. I apparently decided to write an essay on race relations in a subreddit rather than the one on Klein Bottles that I should be working on."

brownbeauty,3coemp,Oifr,13,Thu Jul 9 23:27:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I think that your reply and the response to your reply was mostly due to the whole 'MUA is inclusive, we promise' thing that I was talking about.   Actually a few months back, maybe a year ago, there was a post on MUA that kind of put the whole subreddit into an uproar (though what post about race doesn't). Basically, a person basically made a post about how infrequently POC are up voted and also about the lack of constrictive criticism given to POC. At the time, whenever a darker skinned person posted they'd usually get directed to this subreddit. Which was not very helpful as this subreddit wasn't (and still isn't) very active. There was lots of arguing, but basically in the end people (most likely white women) decided that recommending people to this sub made MUA look exclusionary (because they were the main ones doing it at the time).  I personally don't know how to feel about it. On one hand, why shouldn't we be able to post on a make-up sub that's meant for everyone? MUA is a bigger and more active sub so why should we be restricted to post in a place where significantly fewer people will see our posts and be able to help us?   But on the other hand, the more people that post here, the more active this sub gets, the less I have to deal with MUAs bullshit."

On top of that, they sell foundation packs with multiple shades fir free shipping if you buy the pack by itself. I took the quiz thing and got my shade, then bought the sample pack and the shade I feel is best for me is one shade away from what they recommended. Pretty accurate."

TWO BEAUTY BOXES from Onyx Box?! One is Onyx Beat vs. the Onyx Box (I have no clue on the difference, nor will I question my swag)! What's in the box(es)? Onyx Beat - AJ Crimson in ""Chasing Saturday"" (A matte hot pink) - Revlon Bold Lacquer Mascara - Ofra Eyeliner in ""Lagoon"" (Blue!! Yassss!!!) - Ofra Lip Liner in ""Plum"" (Midtone Brown) - Profixx Lip Pigment in ""Wonderland"" (Light Purple) Onyx Box (This may have come later in June, but they made up for it in weight. The box was kind of heavy when I picked it up - yeah buddy...) - Creme of Nature Exotic Shine Color in ""Ginger Blonde"" - Creme of Nature with Argan Oil, Butterlicious Curls - Cantu Softening Body Butter - Amauri Naturals Butter Soft Hair Butter - Stinkbug Naturals Deodorant Creme in Tangerine Spice - Dark & Lovely Coil Moisturizing Souffle, Super Softening Hair Butter, and Curl Defining Creme Glaze - Curly Hair Solutions ""Curl Keeper"" - Creme of Nature, Straight from Eden Repairing Oil - Creme of Nature - Leave-In Hair Milk with Argan Buttermilk, Cleansing Conditioner Co-Wash, Pudding Perfection, Twirling Custard Styling Gel, and Repairing Treatment Moisturizing Milk Masque Phew! And that's it! HA! I haven't had a chance to open any of these really (still trying to work through the other ""samples"" they sent me. P.S. Their samples are usually full sized bottles. Dope.) Let me tell you, out of all of this AMAZING SWAG I received, the one that I'm most excited about is the deodorant cream. I've heard of alternatives to store bought deodorant but never put in the effort to look for anything else. And let me tell you, the Tangerine Spice smells...exotic! I don't know any other way to describe it. It smells rejuvenating. I'm excited about this Profixx lip pigment as well. I've always done a lipstick or, my favorite, liquid lipstick - but never a pigment. These other items - lol! - will take a while for me to get through. Especially the Creme of Nature packs. That count is LARGE! I'm not going to dye my hair, but 'm still excited about the other products. XD"
brownbeauty,3bw9rw,pinay53,9,Thu Jul 2 17:52:27 2015 UTC,NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer. Been using it for about two months and I LOVE it. It is a bit pricey but a little goes a long way. I blend it out with my finger or a beauty blender and then put on whatever other product I'm using it with.
brownbeauty,3bw9rw,sunnyk879,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:48:27 2015 UTC,"I can vouch for this. It's lasted me a good few months as well, with almost daily application."

They look the same once blended on my skin, but there's a $20 difference. LA Girl has a built in brush and Bobbi Brown doesn't, I just use my finger to apply it. Both are super buildable and work well with my sensitive skin."
brownbeauty,3bw9rw,LaFemmeFatale24,3,Thu Jul 2 19:27:58 2015 UTC,"mac studio finish! I use it for undereyes mostly, where it does require a setting powder for it not to crease, but anywhere else it's fine by itself. i've gone through 3 pots in ~2.5 years and it's affordable. the NW-shades with their orange base are really great for my suuuuper purple/blue undereyes."
brownbeauty,3bw9rw,ethiobirds,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:31:02 2015 UTC,"I like MAC SF too, but probably not HG. I find that it works really well with blemishes that aren't completely flat, concealing them more. I use it for spot concealing and it lasts quite a while!"
brownbeauty,3bw9rw,nauticalsun,3,Mon Jul 6 13:25:56 2015 UTC,"My favorite concealer from the ones I've tried is the Nars Creamy Concealer, it's easy to apply, has a great texture and provides amazing coverage, you only need a little bit. I'm an NC43-NC45 depending on the season and I use the Caramel shade. I also use NYX Concealer in a Jar in Orange to cover some hyperpigmentation."

brownbeauty,3bw9rw,maya_dave,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:31:09 2015 UTC,"My fave is the NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer, but for a drugstore brand I really like the L'oreal True Match concealer! The warm shades have just enough yellow to match, and a little goes a long way. My only complaint is that it can be a bit drying, so I'm careful not to use too much, or to mix in a little face cream.  I haven't found a concealer that covers up as well as using a 2-step concealer process (colour-correcting first). It makes a huge difference, and helps me not cake on the concealer. I've heard orange is good for dark acne marks, but I use green myself."

I don't think Too Faced's non-neutrals are very dark skintone friendly.   If your purpose is to step away from neutrals, Sleek make some very good pop-of-color palettes. Work especially well for women of color because of how pigmented they are.  I know the colors are true to pan, haven't tested them for longevity myself.

brownbeauty,3blbpm,bomkum,3,Tue Jun 30 03:46:09 2015 UTC,"I have about a million highlighters that have caught my eye online lately and finally got a chance to compare them all. I had originally planned to take pictures for self reference only, not reddit, otherwise I would have been better about super clear swatches and indirect lighting pictures too. I don‚Äôt know how helpful these cell phone pictures are so I‚Äôm a little intimidated to post at /r/mua but thought I‚Äôd post here! Some quick notes:   My inner arm is lighter than my face. The best foundation match I‚Äôve found to date is Loreal Pro Matte in 108, so lighter than that? NC40?? lol sorry so unhelpful I don‚Äôt think a more pigmented highlighter is necessarily better, in fact some people may find them harder to work with than a sheer formula.  I obviously haven‚Äôt worn these all on my face, so my first impression is just on color and blendability with my fingers on my arm.  The swatches nearest my elbow should probably be given the benefit of the doubt. They likely rubbed against my shirt more as I made my way outside the mall.   Some standout first impressions   I fell IN LOVE with the Laura Geller. It‚Äôs so gold, so shiny. It impressed me more than the Becca highlighters that have gotten so much hype. Not that Becca was bad, but when I finally swatched them myself it was an ‚Äú‚Ä¶.oh, that‚Äôs it?‚Äù kind of moment. It‚Äôs not shown in the pictures, but I also played with the cream versions and they felt quite thick and greasy! Maybe the testers had just been too abused. Too Faced, Josie Maran, and Nars all felt stiff and took a few swipes to get color pay off. I wasn‚Äôt impressed with TF, but I‚Äôve swatched Albatross before and I think the tester today had developed hard pan. To be fair to Josie, the Enlightenment Powder is supposed to be more of an all-over-veil, but it looked like literally nothing swathed onto my finger. Eh. Laura Mercier had the least glitter, but has a pretty white base. I wonder if it‚Äôd pull ashy on deeper skintones? I know KathaleenLights on Youtube likes this for a more ‚Äúglowy‚Äù effect rather than shimmer. I swatched the Kevin Aucoin contour palette book thingy, and I‚Äôm not sure how the formula compares to the full size Candlelight. KA along with MUFE were very pretty, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm lusting after them as of right now. The Mac MSFs felt so soft, wow. They had both sheen and sparkle, plus a lot of color payoff in one swipe, which I don‚Äôt think my phone could quite capture. I‚Äôm pretty sold on Soft & Gentle, but I dunno how I‚Äôd use Gold Deposit even on my tan skintone. Perhaps as a ‚Äúbronzer topper‚Äù or something?   My favorites today were definitely Laura Geller Gilded Honey and the Mac MSFs. I hope this post was helpful!"

brownbeauty,3b2gx5,Legobegobego,2,Thu Jun 25 19:15:15 2015 UTC,Check out Ellarie on Instagram/YouTube. I love her tutorials and she has darker skin like me!
brownbeauty,3avxpx,cynicalfly,6,Tue Jun 23 22:54:38 2015 UTC,Neutral for the lid? Shimmer/Matte/Satin?  Darker Indian skin like NC45 or NC50?
brownbeauty,3avxpx,chiffonandheels,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:53:27 2015 UTC,NC50 is likely the closest. Although much less yellow and even darker in some areas of the face like the sides of cheeks.  Matte or satin is best. Doctor appropriate.
brownbeauty,3avxpx,chiffonandheels,4,Wed Jun 24 00:35:50 2015 UTC,This palette has a lot of really good matte/satin shades that are darker nudes-- there are also shimmery shades that would be doctor appropriate when paired with a matte through the crease.
brownbeauty,3avxpx,Anne_of_Avonlea,2,Wed Jun 24 00:47:20 2015 UTC,I have Naked 1 and Buck is the only true neutral I use from it (NC45). And even that's now been replaced by my Chocolate palette.

brownbeauty,3avxpx,pshah514,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:22:22 2015 UTC,"Urban decay lid primer or ulta/ sephora lid primer. I have ulta and urban decay, I prefer the later. You use a lot less with urban decay, it lasts longer,  it does not feel as oily as ulta to me."
brownbeauty,3avxpx,ibby_be,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:47:31 2015 UTC,Is the primer colored? I use the NARS one which is clear so would the UD one make a difference?
brownbeauty,3avxpx,pshah514,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:52:20 2015 UTC,UD is a light tan color but it blends well.

brownbeauty,3avxpx,recycledpaper,2,Wed Jun 24 14:29:18 2015 UTC,Love love this palette. Picked up the Pro palette because of how well the Umzipped shadows performed.
brownbeauty,3avxpx,MyLittleLabMonkey,2,Wed Jun 24 05:48:16 2015 UTC,"If you're looking at singles, I like Makeup Geek shadows, and Inglot shadows. Inglot in particular has some wonderful shades for deeper skins. I also like Colourpop shadows, but look up swatches first - some of them are great but others can be a tad too glittery.  For palettes, I really like the KVD Monarch. Lorac Unzipped is also another good option. I also rather like my Coastal Scents Revealed 1 and 2 palettes."
brownbeauty,3avxpx,jingabobo,2,Wed Jun 24 08:03:41 2015 UTC,"theBalm Meet Matte & Tarte Tartelette Palettes are matte & give a nice subtle look overall. They will be intense if you use an eyeshadow base and pat on the shadow instead of swiping it on.  I love the Lorac Pro. It works for all occasions & has a mix of satin & shimmer! I also love Stila Eyes Are the Window - Soul Palette, although it is all shimmer, I can make it work for work. :) They also have a matte palette called Mind."
brownbeauty,3avxpx,kab216,2,Wed Jun 24 14:07:11 2015 UTC,Lorac pro would be good. You can layer a mac paint pot base (after primer) to make the colors pop even more. I like to use either painterly or soft ochre.

It would be easier to give you some reccomendations if I knew more about you. What's your coloring like? What do you want out of your makeup looks ( a natural everyday look, something more polished/professional, or more daring dramatic it colorful). What do you feel is missing from your look? Perhaps you could post a picture of yourself and one of someone wearing the kind of look you want to go for?"
brownbeauty,3apvo3,beautylit,2,Mon Jun 22 15:41:02 2015 UTC,"I suppose I feel that when I wear makeup I do it very haphazardly. Like I know the basics like using primers before foundation. But I know very little about blush, bronzer, countouring, false eyelashes, application tools, application techniques, etc. I have been trying to figure out how to go about incorporating these kinds of things but I feel a little overwhelmed by all the info out there and trying to decipher what's good what isn't. Also I'm pretty comfortable with neutral eyeshadow colors but I want to expand more into brighter colors since it is summer.  And I want to figure out how to have a more put together look for work. I work at a law firm and most of the women have really flawless natural looking makeup.  Something like this would be cool for work http://imgur.com/4yPhEa9   Something like this ( the heavy dark eye makeup) for going out  http://imgur.com/cyVuKud  And here I am no makeup http://imgur.com/EprJk9z   And an attempt at makeup (I think I used a little too much MUFE translucent powder) http://imgur.com/1lB2cM6"
brownbeauty,3apvo3,beautylit,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:37:20 2015 UTC,"Those looks you picked would be awesome for you. for your skin tone I would recommend getting started with a warm toned blush like Mac fleur power (more pink coral) or peaches (more peachy). I actually really love the real techniques blush brush, and if you get a blush that's Seems barely there you won't over do it or feel like a clown.  Bronzer is easy, you can just blend it underneath your blush, but contour is more tricky. Everyone has a different face shape and preference with that. I use a Mac mineralized skin finish in a darker color than my natural skin color and I like it because it blends easy. However I am darker than you so I can't use most bronzers out there. You may be light enough to try some of the popular too faced ones.  As far as adding pops of color to your look, bold lips really do go a long way. A matte red lipstick will make you look Beyonc√©-beat even if you just have in foundation and powder because it just works to brighten your entire face. Don't be afraid to try red, fuschia, orange, and purple lips!  A little turquoise eyeshadow on the bottom lash line looks awesome with brown eyes as well.   So I said a lot but don't be afraid to try out a new blush and lipstick and see if that makes you feel more polished. You can always post a picture here and get feedback."

brownbeauty,3apvo3,chiffonandheels,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:50:55 2015 UTC,"I agree wholeheartedly about the bold lipstick suggestion. It is one of the easiest ways to look polished in seconds.   ¬†  My personal favorite look for work/school is lightly filled in eyebrows (I use a matte brown eyeshadow but feel free to experiment with pencils/gels/pomades), mascara (I like Laura Geller GlamLash Dramatic Volumizing Mascara but it is super natural and not dramatic at all), and fuschia lips (I like Bite Beauty's Matte Lip Cream in Framboise).   ¬†  Another way to low key incorporate color into your routine is colored liner. If you want to ease into it, I suggest purples and forest greens. I like Urban Decay's 24/7 pencil liners.  ¬†  (Also one last thing, this is really off topic sorry but how do you like the Amore Pacific Control Cushion? It looks super cool online but I haven't seen it in person)"
brownbeauty,3apvo3,LaFemmeFatale24,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:20:14 2015 UTC,"Agreed, we need to know what kind of look you're going for in terms of everyday makeup wear.   If you're wearing makeup just to go out to the store or something, perhaps just a tinted moisturizer and brows will do.  If you're more into full coverage, then a primer, liquid foundation, setting powder and all would be recommended!"

I use a lighter hand and a fluffier brush if I want to use it as an all over bronzer too.  Hoola didn't show up for me :(  I used to use Nars Laguna for years, but had to really build it up.  Chocolate Soleil replaced it after I bought it in one of those $20 beauty blogger favorites at Ulta (also on TF's website).  It's actually great if you want to try it out - it comes with deluxe sizes of the eyeshadow primer, BTS mascara, bronzer, and either a nude lipstick or the Primed and Poreless primer depending on which you get. I found nars Casino a little reddish for me.  I also like the contour in Smashbox's trio, but I blend it out with the bronzer in the trio to soften it up a bit.  Ben Nye Banana actually works as the perfect face setting powder for my full face. I haven't tried Bahama Mama, so I can't really offer any feedback on that.  Hope this helps!"

brownbeauty,3a20kg,chiffonandheels,10,Tue Jun 16 16:43:45 2015 UTC,Isn't it magical how the second color (beige cream one) completely transforms on brown skin?? The 3rd pic looks like a negative of the 2nd pic for the beige color no?!  All the other colors def look so much more vivid and awesome on the brown skin tone! I attribute this to Samantha's love for over doing her bronzer and using foundation 5 shades too dark for her. :)
brownbeauty,3a20kg,jingabobo,7,Tue Jun 16 18:12:50 2015 UTC,"Looks like they swatched it wet/over water on her arm and dry on the other two, which is a bit deceptive of them to not mention that they had to work harder to get the colour to show up :/"
brownbeauty,3a20kg,fantastic_lee,2,Tue Jun 16 19:48:26 2015 UTC,I think they swatched it more times on the third girl ahahaha. I bet the brown had to be applied more densely for color payoff.

My only gripe is that the company is pretty disorganized (it's only 3 people!) so shipping can sometimes be delayed or they forget to send you a notification/tracking number - but I've always received my order."
brownbeauty,3a20kg,blackgirldownunder,2,Wed Jun 17 03:04:26 2015 UTC,"I have the Creme de la Creme palette and a few of their single shadows (no longer available), and the quality of definitely there, it's just that there is no transition shade in the palette which means I use it way less often than my other palettes. I just don't think I $80 love it, which is how much it costs in Australian dollars.  I think if you don't have many other palettes, it would be a good addtion, because it's not like the Naked palette at all imo, because this has the colours shadows that make it more than just another nude palette."
brownbeauty,3a20kg,MyLittleLabMonkey,2,Wed Jun 17 04:20:27 2015 UTC,"Personally, for $80 I would rather get a Viseart palette. I like the Saucebox shadows but I've noted that their neutral shadow formula is better than the colored shadow formula. I bought my palettes when they were on sale, and that's the only way I'll buy from them again - otherwise it's not worth it to me.  If you are interested in the shades in the palette, maybe you could built an Inglot palette for yourself?"
brownbeauty,3a20kg,nahhomiepls,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:38:47 2015 UTC,"I actually think that the shadow quality looks pretty amazing for $60. I have the Naked 3 and the pigmentation is pretty good but nowhere near what those photos are suggesting. I also like that the 'neutrals' are matte while the colors are shimmers. I really like going big with color eyeshadow or going super lowkey and I don't really have an in between so it is really up my alley. Plus I really think that those colors would look amazing on brown gals. Another plus is that each shadow is 4 grams of product (for comparison MAC's full sized eyeshadows are 1.3 grams).  I think that it actually may be the next palette I purchase.   For me, the $80 Viseart palettes are not really comparable . Viseart palettes are super quality but they tend to have very subtle colors and gradation. They are beautiful, works of art but not something I would feel comfortable using daily because the $20 difference still seems significant to me.  tl;dr Shoutout to the Viseart palettes but I really like this BatalashxSaucebox Palette b/c price v. product, color selection, and pigmentation."

I really like nyx addis ababa for a good spring pink that's got color but not like BAM in your face. The formula of this particular shade is weirdly not that intense, so it's a nice opacity!

I remember being younger and feeling so awkward being Hawaiian because there were no other Hawaiians my age in school and things that were normal for me were weird to everyone else. I used to try to blend in with my Mexican friends because we were the same skin color or my Asian friends because we shared an ethnic background. Eventually I gained another Hawaiian friend (well, Hawaiian/Fijian/Chamorro/white/Chinese friend) and felt more comfortable embracing that part of myself. It's amazing what being around people who can relate to you can do."

It took me a few times wearing it to get used to but it's so pretty and MAC lippies are great because you can put it on very light and then layer on more when you become more comfortable with pink lips.
brownbeauty,39ps35,TheSunnySide__,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:54:11 2015 UTC,I did a tutorial for my last post in case anyone wanted to see the it in action :)
brownbeauty,39pvb6,Laylatae,4,Sat Jun 13 16:22:44 2015 UTC,"Hi girl! Graduation is so much fun ahh, congratulations! I graduated in the middle of May in a southern state, so when I walked, it was hot as hell.   I ended up doing my full glam face but settled the fact that I knew I had to go ""dewy."" AKA my sweat gave me a radiant glow in addition to my makeup. I primed very extensively and used a ton of setting spray in order to keep my makeup from moving. You might try a BB cream with spot concealing instead if you're worried about too much foundation! And I kept quite a nude eye (just a simple cat eye with a matte brown through the crease) and a glam brow with a really overstated magenta lip! Pictures came out lovely and I looked fairly sheen free even though I was sweating buckets.  Try false lashes, contoured cheeks,  but not a lot of blush,  and a bright lip. Those will really help without keeping your makeup too heavy."
brownbeauty,39pvb6,chiffonandheels,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:31:39 2015 UTC,"I wasn't much into makeup during my graduation (nor did I have much time). If I could do it again, I would go with concealer, light powder, liquid lipstick, falsies (or just curl your lashes) and my trusty physicians formula pen eyeliner just on the top lid.   Nothing too fancy or fussy. A lot of girls looked like they were melting during graduation. Use products you know you won't have to check up on for hours, because there's likely going to be a lot of standing around and waiting."
brownbeauty,39nz6w,msqualah,9,Sat Jun 13 03:07:21 2015 UTC,"Gotta tell you, not the biggest fan of this brow tutorial. The pencil is way too dark and creamy to be using with such a heavy hand. I wish she'd gone just one shade up or really dispersed the color through the brow. I think if she'd just used a different color, this brow wouldn't look so aggressive (know what I mean?)   But her technique is really good-- using a brow wax before product seems a little counter intuitive, but it helps keep the brow hairs natural looking!"
brownbeauty,39nz6w,chiffonandheels,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:27:28 2015 UTC,I understand what you saying I really do like her technique. Maybe I'll ask her to do it with a light color and see the difference Thanks for commenting.
brownbeauty,39nz6w,mahoganyjones,7,Sat Jun 13 21:22:39 2015 UTC,"Meh. Natural looking brows are more my thing. This looks too artificial. I'd feel too ""painted on"" if I were to walk around looking with my brows like this."
brownbeauty,39nz6w,jingabobo,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:32:55 2015 UTC,Yea that's understandable. Natural looking is great when you don't wear much makeup but when you are a beat face these brows are killin em!
brownbeauty,39nz6w,badstella,3,Sat Jun 13 21:28:03 2015 UTC,"The brows are technically Too perfect.. Hehe what I mean is, not all of us can pull of this type of a bold brow as it draws all the attention towards it.  It looks too black and flawless which makes it look somewhat artificial.  I do think some girls can definitely pull off this look with ease though.  The downside is, you cannot go for a natural or casual no makeup type of face with these brows. They demand a full  made up face! :) She does look very pretty with the full eye makeup and lashes n all.  I think these brows will be great to wear in the evening/night rather than in the daytime.  What I was in awe of most was how perfectly her foundation matched her skin tone! I am jealousssssss. :P"
brownbeauty,39nz6w,badstella,0,Sat Jun 13 14:42:02 2015 UTC,"Yes her foundation is great! Look I have been working on my brow technique, I am no where near this! But I love her brows. I watched one of her videos and I was literally drooling at those brows. Lol they may be perfect but she happens to be a beat face beauty, and she wears them well. I will ask her to do a more natural looking brow and see what she comes up with."
brownbeauty,3985as,Anne_of_Avonlea,9,Tue Jun 9 23:09:35 2015 UTC,"Between the two of these I definitely prefer Persistence on darker skin tones (that have yellow undertones) rather than Whirl, although they're both woc friendly nudes.

Fig Pop is a perfect color for me in the summer...it's the right amount of color and it sticks around all day, which is a problem I have had with other blushes. I got Heather Pop because that's my first name and I couldn't resist. ;). It's not a perfect color for me but layered with Fig Pop, it's realllllly lovely. It's just a touch too light on it's own.  Cola Pop is so flipping gorgeous. It is the prettiest color of blush I have ever worn. I don't have a lot of fancy blush, mind you, but this color is fabulous on me. It's just a touch too dark for me to wear in the summer, but I think it's just lovely.   For reference, I am moderately dark skinned, roughly the same skin tone as Aisha Tyler. I hope this helps!"
brownbeauty,398adg,solonesome,2,Wed Jun 10 00:40:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Heather was definitely one of the ones that was a no go on me, but I'll try swatching those other ones."

brownbeauty,398adg,book-of-kells,2,Wed Jun 10 05:42:15 2015 UTC,"I have Coral Pop and it's amazing. Coral doesn't really suit me but this coral blush reads as pinkish on  me(instead of the dreaded orange) so it's all good.   That said, I'm NC30 or so, and most blush colours show up on my face...The quality of the Cheek Pop blush is really great though, very buttery and pigmented, with a nice satin finish."

Pansy Pop has been a disappointment because I can't seem to make it work with my skintone.  For blush options they would not be my first choice.
brownbeauty,398adg,waldening,2,Sat Jun 13 01:17:03 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit less tan than you, I am about NC42 in Mac according to findation (Estee Lauder 3W2 and Bobbi Brown 5.5).  I have Peach, Berry, and Nude. I bought all of mine at Sephora but I'm starting to see them at the CCO for about $15 around here.  I've had Peach since the collection was released. I love it. I have worn it 2-5 times per week since purchase and the daisy is still quite visible. It is a great warm peachy coral color with some glimmer. It is easy to build up. It makes me look put together and made up, without much effort on my part. Score!  Berry is a great pop of color that blends really nicely. It builds up brightly but it's not too vivid. I don't notice much shimmer with this one.  Nude... I can't decide. Sometimes I think it is the perfect ""warmth and glow"" shade for me. Other times I feel like there is nothing on my face. Yet other times it seems like a pile of glitter on my cheeks. It is the only one of the new collection that I own, and it is definitely more powdery than the other two."
brownbeauty,398adg,Snarkcissist,2,Sat Jun 13 03:40:33 2015 UTC,"I own Ginger Pop! It's actually pretty good for my NC42 ish olive-toned skin. The pigmentation is okay, but nothing too special. Some of Clinique's blushing blushes (I think?) are more pigmented, but also very glittery, so if that's up your street then if suggest those. Cola Pop also worked very well for me, with nary an ashy moment."
brownbeauty,398adg,moonjongup,1 point,Sat Jun 13 10:40:54 2015 UTC,"I have Berry and Cola pop. With a stippling blush brush, it deposits the perfect amount of color to make you look like you have a very natural flush. You can build up the color a lot as well, if you're interested in that.

brownbeauty,391rog,Bella37,17,Mon Jun 8 16:57:19 2015 UTC,"I want to point out color correction for WOC/POC! Darker skin tends to deal more with hyperpigmentation and dark spots, which is often why you see grey areas when it comes to darker skin. I really want to encourage you to carry a few shades of color correctors in your kit, namely a pure orange, sold by NYX and LA Girl in order to bring brightness back to dark/grey areas. MAC (albeit a little bit pricier) also has a great color correcting palette for medium and deep skin tones. NYX came out with one recently, but I find their color range isn't quite deep enough for POC.   Whew, okay, little psa over!  Budget friendly blushes:   NYX  Milani Sleek (as the poster mentioned above me)  Coastal Scents or any other big company like BH will have these palettes that are very richly pigmented and insanely cheap   Lip Liners   Every single Jordana lip liner, especially coco loco. Coco loco is a deep brown that helps so much when applying a bright lipstick to darker skin. Used around the edges, it really helps seamlessly blend a bright color into a darker skin tone.

Flattering colors for my skin tone NC#44 in WnW Mega Last lipsticks - Spiked with Rum, Mocha-licious, Sugar Plum Fairy, Don't Blink Pink  A year ago I would have recommended nyx but I have gotten over them now. Although the colors are really nice, they are very slippy and do not last long on the lips.  I don't use any Drugstore foundation or pressed powders but I've read that the Maybelline Fit Me Poreless is a great line as well as the Revlon Photo Ready line.  Highlighters - I only have 1 drugstore one in Physicians Formula - Bronze Booster Glow-Boosting Airbrushing Bronzing Veil. It is really nice & considered a somewhat dupe of MAC Whisper of Gilt.  Also recommend the Hard Candy So Baked - Tiki bronzer.  I really like theBalm's highlighters in Mary & Betty-Lou-Manizer.  You will find theBalm on Hautelook every 3 months or so and get them for 50% off then.

brownbeauty,38yoe9,fb0mbb,2,Tue Jun 9 00:12:25 2015 UTC,HD Foundation in 178 is the only foundation that matches my skin exactly. It's not too dark or too light and has the perfect undertone.
brownbeauty,38yoe9,itsadooozy,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:25:57 2015 UTC,"The Face and Body foundation is my HG. It has more than the average foundation size bottle and it has a light to medium coverage which is buildable and perfect with buffing brushes and flat top kabuki brushes (and your fingers). I should add this foundation is pretty liquidy and has a dewy finish, so if either of those don't apply to you I would try something else. I've heard their HD foundation is pretty good too!  Also I've heard their new range of step 1 primers are supposed to be good, but that's mostly coming from YouTubers so idk how reliable that information is."
brownbeauty,38yoe9,thefinalproblem,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:51:34 2015 UTC,Ooh that sounds good! I want to see their primers in person because I've seen hype about them online too
brownbeauty,38yoe9,book-of-kells,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:49:00 2015 UTC,"if you're in the market for a matte, creamy concealer, MUFE's full cover concealer is definitely worth a shot. i'm not sure what my exact skin tone is, but i'm currently using the concealer in 10 (golden beige), and while it's not my perfect match, it's close enough to work with for now. it's a bit pricey for .5 fl. oz., but i've found that a little goes a long way with this one-- i've used mine daily for a good few months now, and i can't see it finishing anytime soon!"
brownbeauty,38yoe9,book-of-kells,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:26:03 2015 UTC,OK can I vent? It's such crap that half the products from MUFE (notably their palettes) aren't even sold in Europe. I've given up hope of their most recent palettes appearing on Sephora.fr. It's especially egregious because MUFE is a French company!  I do love their HD blush. I also have their old liquid blush but it's mostly dried out. :( Does anyone know the HD blush dupe for no. 7 of their liquid blush (that one that came in the pump canister)? Maybe I'll post this on MUA also...

Milani is really really good too for darker ladies. If you can't find a certain brand in one store, you're likely to find it in another drugstore, i.e. if it's not in CVS you might find in Rite Aid or Walgreens.   I hope this helps!"
brownbeauty,38uza5,chiffonandheels,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:39:18 2015 UTC,Thank you! Do you have any suggestions for fun eyeliner/shadow colours that might compliment her?
brownbeauty,38uza5,chiffonandheels,3,Sun Jun 7 02:40:53 2015 UTC,"Ooh, also start her off with the basics: foundation (if she's got really good skin you can get away with just a powder foundation) blush if she's feelin' it, and probably a good mascara. I really love L'Oreal Telescopic and Maybelline Falsies. Also rather than lipstick maybe tinted lip balms like baby lips from Maybelline or Burts Bees tinted lip balm!"
brownbeauty,38uza5,chiffonandheels,2,Sun Jun 7 14:13:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah! Start her off with eyeliner pencils because liquid liner takes a lot of practice (and even more courage haha.) Things like blue or purple eyeliner are fun in younger years because makeup is more experimental, I think, and those colors can be found in the wet n wild range or the NYC range. Also, Wet n Wild is a great brand for eyeshadows, both neutral and fun!"
brownbeauty,38uza5,shewh0mustnotbenamed,2,Sun Jun 7 02:43:43 2015 UTC,"/u/chiffonandheels's recommendations are great.  For specifics, I recommend Black Radiance Artisan Color Baked Blush in Toasted Almond and CoverGirl Queen Collection Natural Hue Bronzer."
brownbeauty,38uza5,Selenashines,1 point,Sun Jun 7 13:57:43 2015 UTC,"Covergirl Queen collection all day flawless liquid foundation comes in a wide rage of shades for WOC plus it has spf 20. Please teach her the benefits of sunscreen too. Most AA women suffer from hyper pigmentation and spf can definitely hep with that. The NYX Love in Paris ""merci beaucoup"" eyeshadow palette is great for neutral eye looks too."
brownbeauty,38ojmh,Anne_of_Avonlea,6,Fri Jun 5 15:42:25 2015 UTC,"Well hello. Well I'm not a big fan of Lake and I don't believe I possess a single product of theirs.   I'd say load up on cheaper but quality eyeliners in different colours, nailpolish and maybe some blush.  As a NW45, I always use just MAC for foundation and I buy brushes and the rest from colorbar mostly.   Best thing to do is look up all the online shops now like flipkart, jabong.com,  myntra etc. And order what you want in advance and your BF could just pick it up.   As for specific products please do try this blush by coloressence  (a local brand) and the especially the color Satin Beige. It looks nearly invisible bit still defines my face magically. This brand's blushers are really good.  On Jabong.com check out all cosmetics by Star's cosmetics. It's also a local indian brand and I'm pretty impressed by their attempt to make foundation and concealer palettes for a large range of skin tones. I recently bought their yellow powder as a substitute for Ben Nyes Banana Powder and it seems just fine to me. I bought one of their black eyeshadow and it has good pigmentation.   Oh. From colorbar, I'm in love with their matt lipsticks which cost just 300 rs. I own Passion, hearts and tarts, and Oh my magenta. Super rich colour and the shades I mentioned are pretty awesome for my dark skin.  Passion is a deep maroon. Hearts and Tarts is a rich, rich red and Oh My Magenta is a gorgeous pink - magenta shade.   I don't think there is anything special going on in trends right. But do check out the shops I mentioned. Cheers.  EDIT : lakme  not lake."
brownbeauty,38ojmh,mishmash27,2,Fri Jun 5 16:58:34 2015 UTC,"I have to second ColourBar lipsticks! I'm an Indo-Canadian and my aunt brought back some Colour Bar matte lipsticks and they're phenomenal! They have decent staying power (you do have to reapply a little if you're eating a meal), and feel super comfortable on the lips. I also love the Maybelline Colossal Kajal! That stuff is budge proof!"
brownbeauty,38ojmh,abird-eyeview,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:18:50 2015 UTC,Colossal is.doing really well. I've found that lakme's eyeconic is also very good. Even better than maybelline in my opinion since it seems darker and even more smudge proof. But it is more expensive.
brownbeauty,38ojmh,mishmash27,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:29:52 2015 UTC,Thank you so much. This was so thorough and helpful! Thanks for including the online shops as well. I will definitely check out all of these.
brownbeauty,38ojmh,Unreuly,3,Fri Jun 5 17:44:21 2015 UTC,"Fellow Canadian brown girl here. I spent a number of months in India a couple months ago, and the one absolutely must-have product that I still use everyday and don't know what I'll do after I run out, is Maybelline's Colossal Kajal. They have the 6 hour and the 12 hour variety, of which I prefer the latter. The formula is so so different from any liner I've tried at home...it stays on all day, doesn't run, and is safe for the waterline, just like regular kajal. Would highly recommend!"
brownbeauty,38ojmh,HoofFan23,2,Fri Jun 5 19:24:10 2015 UTC,"Revlon lipstick in Rosy Nude...google it, it has plenty of glowing reviews and watches and isnt sold in the US."
brownbeauty,38ojmh,ari-mulagu,2,Fri Jun 5 18:23:39 2015 UTC,"I love to stock up on brown-friendly makeup in India! Stay away from the foundations though-the quality isn't that great and the shades they sell you don't really match up. I've had really good luck with lip shades in India. All the colors look great on our skin tones! Lotus herbals is also a nice brand with pretty lip shades. I've heard good things about their carnation shade. I also have some corals in their brand-all great. Elle 18 is also a good brand for lip shades, as is lakme's 9-5 range. Lakme's setting powder is my favorite- it lasts forever, has sunscreen, good scent, and is dirt cheap. Will edit with other things I have in my makeup collection when I get home!"
brownbeauty,38ojmh,Soan,2,Fri Jun 5 22:00:13 2015 UTC,"Another brown girl here. I hate Lakme. Their face products usually break me out. At that price, I would rather buy NYX lip products. My must buy in India is Colorbar's kajal stick. It has amazing staying power."
brownbeauty,38ojmh,spicychamp,2,Sat Jun 6 00:56:04 2015 UTC,"I'm going to India in a couple of months and I'm interested in picking up some things too! Last time I went I remember that the SA at the Lakme counter tried to match me with a foundation shade that was wayyyy too light for me, saying it would make me look ""fair"" ugh. And based on their website it looks like they barely carry shades going as deep as NC30 (or yellow/olive-toned enough), and they label everything ""Fair X."" It's a damn shame that the major Indian beauty brand is so awful when it comes to foundation shades.  BUT, I did buy this eyeshadow quad from them, and I re-discovered it recently, and it is BEAUTIFUL. Super-pigmented and rich and deep. I want to get the other variations for sure (I think there are two or three more). http://www.amazon.com/Lakme-Eye-Color-Quartet-Desert/dp/B006LX9GSW"
brownbeauty,38ojmh,spicychamp,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:31:30 2015 UTC,"That's so funny, based on my google search the Lakme quads were on the list of 'what to avoid.' But honestly a lot of the reviews are not very thorough. And ugh, all that skin lightening. >.>"
brownbeauty,38ojmh,FreeRangeGirl,2,Fri Jun 5 17:45:55 2015 UTC,They are very bright and shimmery and definitely not neutral. I haven't pulled off a look using multiple shades in the quad - I use a shade on the lid and a matte dark color from another quad to create some definition.
brownbeauty,38ojmh,MyLittleLabMonkey,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:02:21 2015 UTC,Another brand I really like and hard to find here in the US is Chambor. It is made in Germany / Sweden and can be bought in India. Check out their lip liners and eyeliners. Also moisturizing lip colors.
brownbeauty,38ojmh,jingabobo,1 point,Sat Jun 6 06:16:54 2015 UTC,"Colorbar Matte lipsticks are great! And they have some chubby lip pencils similar to the Bobbi Brown Art Sticks that are also nice. They also make some really nice eyeliner, especially if you like colors! Also get the L'Oreal Moist Matte lipsticks, they're not available in the US. I find them a tad better than the Maybelline matte lipsticks. The Maybelline color show (?) nailpolishes are cheaper there than they are here, so it might be worth stocking up on a couple shades."
brownbeauty,38ojmh,sskaz,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:46:29 2015 UTC,"Ok I lived in India for the first 25 years of my life.. and although makeup was not thaaaat popular the one thing you need to buy there is Kajal because ppl don't wear it much here it is hard to find (in US). Kajal is not exactly the same as eyeliner pencil, the formula is a bit different so that it stays on the waterline longer.  Bourgeois and Revlon make great Kajal pencils.  Skip any face products, they always broke me out so I never wore foundation in India.  Definitely buy skin care products, Lotus Herbals & Biotique were SO good!!"
brownbeauty,38ojmh,blamingthenargles,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:23:56 2015 UTC,Colorbar lip liners are great. I especially like the coral and rosy red shades.

It's a little greasy and I have to wait to apply makeup over top but it's the best drugstore sunscreen I've found. In photos/general there's a tiny bit of whitecast but it's not 'ashy ghost' and I just make sure I use a foundation that's not a 'tad too light.' (Also, this might be giving me little pimples).    For more expensive I love La Roche Posay Anthelios 60. And there's no competition and no comparison between the two. This one is dry to the touch and 0 white cast."

brownbeauty,38ioqx,Brompton_Cocktail,2,Sat Jun 6 15:24:12 2015 UTC,I don't know whether you get Lotus where you are from but Lotus has a matt gel formula that is invisible after it sets on your skin.   I use that and Vichy Capital Soleil. Both products are 50 SPF and I'm an NW45 too

Right now I'm using EltaMD UV Clear, which does seem to alter my color a little bit, but without a noticeable whitecast. So basically, I can tell that my skin looks a bit lighter, but it doesn't make you look like a ghost and no one else can tell you're wearing sunscreen. It's also completely not greasy, and contains niacinamide, which helps heal scars and discolorations."

I also sometimes use the Biore Aqua Rich watery Essence SPF 50+ PA++++. This one is a little more drying to my skin though. Also, for a moisturizer I use the cetaphil with SPF50. Sometimes if I pump too much it's a little hard to rub in but my skin always loses the white cast."

Our brand is for all complexions so I usually end-up chatting with them, it seems like a trusted brand for young woman over there. It also often comes up in the conversation that they don't want to buy the same brands than their mothers, who will usually go for Iman, Fashion Fair, because they find it too expensive and ''old''.   Black Up prices are around the same than Make Up For Ever, NARS & MAC... Not that bad."

brownbeauty,384a04,chiffonandheels,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:33:24 2015 UTC,You might consider going to a beauty shop or a salon owned by black women and men. I think the artists there would know how to cover hyperpigmentation and do a great job on your tan skin.  For indian weddings I found: Bella Angel
brownbeauty,384a04,jingabobo,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:42:39 2015 UTC,"I would recommend seeking out a bunch of Desi Salons and asking to see their portfolios.  Only potential danger there is the inclination to 'lighten' our faces with foundations that are 2 shades too light. :(  On the othr hand MUA's that are not desi & not experienced with our skin tones almost always seem to choose a shade too dark. I don't know why, I've experienced this a dozen times while foundation shopping. Ugh..It is hard but some R&D will be needed to find the right MUA.  Hoping someone on here lives in Philly & can help you out!! Congratulations on the wedding!!"
brownbeauty,3809a3,1000timesover,5,Sun May 31 22:03:40 2015 UTC,MAC carbon is my go to liner setting single black eye shadow. I also really like the black that comes in the lorac pro palette (A good investment for medium/ deep skin imo).
brownbeauty,3809a3,nevermindimdown,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:05:23 2015 UTC,"I was at MAC yesterday and swatched Carbon on my hand. I had read so many good reviews on it, but it seemed really chalky/not very pigmented. Maybe I just tried out a bad batch or something... Thank you for the suggestion though! And yes to the Lorac Pro palette! I'm thinking of ordering it, so I may just try out that black first."

brownbeauty,3809a3,mstk,2,Mon Jun 1 00:37:21 2015 UTC,I use it very sparingly in the outer corner to deepen looks. It's easier to build up than to have to wipe it off and try again.

brownbeauty,3809a3,jingabobo,2,Mon Jun 1 08:34:52 2015 UTC,"My favorite way to use it is to use it like eyeliner, wear it dry with a teeny tiny smudge eyeshadow brush(I use the elf one) and carefully pat it as close to my lash line as I can. It is definitely thicker than a thin liquid eyeliner BUT it looks so amazing.. it gives sort of a hazy, subtle smoked out look. I prefer this to the harsh black eyeliner on some days, especially when I'm wearing lighter/eyeshadows."

There was a post about a year ago with checkmate whatever who posted a vaguely ""tribal warrior"" type of thing and she was attacked left and right by a bunch of non native, non tribal people for appropriation. So the community is clearly inconsistent in who is ""allowed"" to feel offense or even what is offensive."

But I feel that minorities often have to adapt and assimilate and give up their uniqueness for the sake of not bothering the dominant culture.  And then that culture gets to just take whatever they want (while leaving the unwanted, negative aspects).  This is usually not a cultural exchange between equals, even though it is framed as such."

This is usually not a cultural exchange between equals, even though it is framed as such.     Being black, this is what really gets me in these situations. No one wants to talk about what the culture being appropriated goes through, but they just want the cute, pretty, fun parts. Then when it's time to talk about the ugly realities underlying all of this, the discussion falls back on the ""well I didn't colonize you guys"" defense.    And I get it to some extent. This stuff is probably pretty confusing and shocking if you've never been exposed to the other side of it, but the vitriol and denial -- or ""bizarrely aggressive ton-deafness,"" as /u/multirachael beautifully put it -- are when I start to get discouraged. I'm staying out of that thread, but I really wouldn't have a problem with engaging someone in constructive debate over cultural appropriation, because it really is a difficult issue. But people have to get their heads out of the sand before we can talk about it rationally."

brownbeauty,37qcuz,HollaDude,18,Sat May 30 04:46:04 2015 UTC,"The whole thing is you're appropriating a culture that the dominant culture actively suppresses and ridicules. If you're Irish, I'm assuming you're white. White people are not discriminated against in America. They just aren't.   I can't speak about race relations in the rest of the world, but cultural appropriation is something that's important in America because it's a country of immigrants. Immigrants that were consistently discriminated against throughout history.   I think that's a huge thing that people are missing, it differs from country to country. Obviously cultural appropriation in say India is not going to be the same as what it is in America."

Twisted mini buns are actually bantu knots, a hairstyle Africans have been wearing literally forever that white people seem to have just decided we're cool enough to copy. I remember (white) people thinking I was weird af when I was younger and would wear them after I saw Jada Pinkett Smith rock the hell out of them in the Matrix. Anyway, the post was removed, so maybe they realized how wrong they were. Or maybe they just wanted to erase the backlash it had stirred up."

brownbeauty,37qcuz,-cutestofborg-,4,Fri May 29 17:17:33 2015 UTC,"Sorry but I was there for that and I saw your post, I didn't think she resembled Michelle Obama but she did say her bob was styled after Michelle's so maybe people made the connection there. Sometimes I think two people resemble one another and other people will think I'm crazy, some people just see things differently, I didn't think that instance was a race thing. Recently I was telling my sister how a famous figure skating coach looks like an older Sam Smith and she kept insisting I was blind and crazy and the only common denominator was that they're both white =( I toggled between them too and I still didn't change my mind  As another POC, in general I find /r/femalefashionadvice to be one of the better subs when discussing cultural appropriation, there was this discussion about wearing a sari where I found the top comments very informative and well thought out and there have been other discussions on traditional clothing from other cultures. I myself am East Asian and I found that there were other POCs in the sub who explained things about cultural appropriation better than I ever could. I remember a discussion on H&M and their practices with angora fur, in MFA and defaults subs they were calling Chinese people slurs and there were vicious xenophobic/yellow peril comments being thrown around. I was actually hurt the point where I had to stop, close reddit and get off the computer. The same thing was posted in FFA and I didn't find a single xenophobic comment, it was more about the ethics of buying clothes from fast fashion retailers and I had a huge sense of relief because I've had many close calls with quitting reddit.   This turned out a bit longwinded and maybe I don't make much sense but I think you deserve more calm answer because they were really quite harsh on you (I'm pretty sure there was a comment that was simply ""you dumb,"" it was downvoted in the end but when I saw it at first it had 5 upvotes). There has been times where stuff in FFA has made me roll my eyes really hard but I guess what I'm trying to say is that compared to MUA, it's not as bad, it's in a way better place than MUA and I find there is a much better representation of diversity in that sub compared to many other subs when I go through the WAYWT compared to all the selfies on the front page of MUA."
brownbeauty,37qcuz,binbincrackers,1 point,Fri May 29 23:50:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not familiar with Michelle Obama's style so I'll take your word on it, I grew up in a predominantly black area and everyone had long hair so the bob after people said it, did make me think Michelle Obama a little bit. Maybe I'm just not exposed to this stuff enough.  I agree with the subtle racism, I think I mentioned this in a different thread about the whole MUA fiasco. It's like when white people talk about being ""colorblind"" which is just as harmful. Racism is more implicit than explicit now which makes it hard for white folks to recognize and they refuse to listen when explained to. If you try to explain anything they just tell you they don't care, I've gotten that reaction on reddit before. It's like white men who think they're doing Asian girls some kind of favour and they say they have a fetish. It's gross and I don't want to touch you with a 10 foot pole."
brownbeauty,37qcuz,binbincrackers,29,Sat May 30 05:26:10 2015 UTC,"It's kind of classic reddit how the top comment is now representing the opinion of the downvoted comments, but with the ""moderate voice of reason"" approach. It's not surprising, but it's always sad how that works.    It's always deeply bothered me that the reaction to a simple ""as a member of X racial or ethnic group, I find this disrespectful or upsetting or bothersome"" is met with so much vitriol. The comment with the most downvotes was civil, while some pretty appallingly rude comments in response to her are netting positive. This is one of the more disappointing incidents lately."
brownbeauty,37qcuz,honeybuttery,24,Fri May 29 19:56:51 2015 UTC,ALSO can we just lump in henna and mandala into the same cultural appropriation scheme? APPARENTLY WE CAN.   this is some shit y'all.
brownbeauty,37qcuz,chiffonandheels,34,Sat May 30 04:17:13 2015 UTC,"I'm put off by this sort of thing in general, but seeing the downvotes and comments to people who feel the same way really just make me want to get out of there altogether.  Edit: I was thinking about this more and I feel like the actual post/image bothered me less than reading all the justification for it."
brownbeauty,37qcuz,-cutestofborg-,20,Sun May 31 20:34:39 2015 UTC,"The justification is way worse than the actual picture. Also the fact that OP isn't responding to any of the controversial comments, but all the one's that say she looks beautiful."
brownbeauty,37qcuz,ria1328,21,Sun May 31 23:41:49 2015 UTC,"Ah, exactly the kind of bizarrely aggressive tone-deafness that made me leave MUA in the first place."
brownbeauty,37qcuz,multirachael,29,Fri May 29 19:04:43 2015 UTC,"I think OP did a fantastic job.  It's clean and crisp. The stark white on her pale skin makes it stand out. You can tell she really appreciates the beautiful intricacy of Henna.    I think it's great that someone who (assumingly) does not come from a culture of which Henna is associated with, found it so interesting and was inspired to do this. It's great to know that people take an interest in our culture, and there's nothing wrong with that.  It's not like she drew a few squiggles and said ""lol henna inspired look"".  So with that said, I don't necessarily agree with the allegations of OP's look being offensive.  But maybe some Desis aren't as comfortable as others when they see a non-Desi wearing something Desi related.    What I hate about /r/makeupaddiction, and that thread is a perfect example, is that you can't have and voice your own opinion if it goes against everyone else's hivemind.  If your opinion does go against it, then you're just downvoted into oblivion.  I don't agree with what that commenter said, but I'm not going to downvote them for it.  Nor am I going to waste my time by downvoting their entire posting history.  That subreddit is just so...toxic.  The things that some people post, just because someone didn't agree with the popular opinion, is just vile."
brownbeauty,37qcuz,Laylatae,7,Fri May 29 19:36:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the strong reactions are what really got to me.  Someone saying that it might be a little appropriation got downvoted hundreds of times. Why not just politely disagree? I liked the discussion in /r/muajcdiscussion for the most part, but the original thread in MUA was really depressing."
brownbeauty,37qcuz,-cutestofborg-,3,Fri May 29 16:15:35 2015 UTC,"Also, the fact that someone took the time to go through the commenter's posting history and dig up what they've said previously, only to then use that as an argument against them is just...why? Who has the time for that? Why the need to be so petty?"
brownbeauty,37qcuz,Laylatae,8,Fri May 29 22:00:03 2015 UTC,"In a nutshell: If you're not offended, fine. But don't invalidate someone else's feelings or experiences by silencing them with downvotes. Err on the side of empathy and at least try to understand their point of view, even if you can't share it."
brownbeauty,37qcuz,dratthecookies,7,Fri May 29 18:17:16 2015 UTC,"I wasn't offended by what the OP did. I understand why people were bothered though. It isn't really henna, and she could have left out the ""henna inspired"" title. Also, if she wore that design out in public, then she wouldn't be ridiculed the same way a brown person would.   As long as someone isn't turning it into a costume, I'm okay with cultural appropriation. To me, it wasn't a costume.   What was more troublesome, is just how much people weren't listening. A lot of people had very valid points, and they were just down-voted. While really hateful, logically flawed comments were up-voted over and over again.   It was just exhausting. You had to respond to the same kind of comments over and over again.   BUT, I will say this. Remember when discussing feminism was super frowned upon, now most celebrities identify as feminists. Hopefully people will start to understand cultural appropriation better in the future as well."
brownbeauty,37qcuz,HollaDude,18,Fri May 29 20:17:52 2015 UTC,"Cultural appropriation bothers me when I know if I did the same thing  in public, I would get stared/laughed at. Basically, holding people to different standards.  I have only gotten admiration and positive comments for wearing Henna so this doesn't bother me as much. Wearing traditional Indian clothing however is a different story."
brownbeauty,37qcuz,yougoglencocox,3,Sat May 30 05:23:59 2015 UTC,"Probably because people are amused at how well you can carry yourself in Indian clothes, not being of Indian subcontinent origin?"
brownbeauty,37qcuz,honeydew5,33,Sat May 30 13:22:32 2015 UTC,"I'm desi and I downvoted those comments not because I wanted to ""bury"" them but because I didn't think that their concerns were legitimate. I think it's patronizing to assume that a 5000 year old culture with one billion people is somehow demeaned when one white person decides to use henna/indian motifs. I also think it's stupid when people act as if all desis who use bindis/henna do it after a profound study of the origins and meaning of those things."
brownbeauty,37qcuz,culturalappropriator,5,Sat May 30 13:00:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you for saying this. I'm Indian, living in India. And I seriously think this is a first world issue created by people with too much time in their hands. Do you think anyone in India actually cares if a white girl puts henna?  I wear jeans and eat pasta too... so does that make me evil."
brownbeauty,37qcuz,_o_O_o_O_o_,30,Sat May 30 04:45:21 2015 UTC,"So, I don't mean to belittle your opinion, but cultural appropriation with regards to what was being discussed in that thread has to do with what it feels like to be a minority in a majority culture. If you're an Indian in India, how do you know what it feels like to be an Indian in America? Especially post 9/11 when a lot of this stuff began to get heated."
brownbeauty,37qcuz,HollaDude,2,Fri May 29 17:25:54 2015 UTC,"I currently live in the US and I don't see how random white people wearing bindis/henna take anything away from me. The US isn't colonial India, it's a diverse country with a lot of different cultures. There is no systematic discrimination of desis in the US. In fact they are one of the the more affluent groups in terms of education and wealth.   Also, a lot of the wording in the comments referred to Indian culture being somehow demeaned or made lesser by white people using it without ""knowing its proper significance"". That's not the same argument as being a minority in a majority culture. And it's something that doesn't just involve desis in the US."
brownbeauty,37qcuz,culturalappropriator,26,Fri May 29 17:53:47 2015 UTC,"There is no systematic discrimination of desis in the US.   You absolutely cannot make that claim, America is a huge country. I'm really happy that you've faced such little discrimination, that's really awesome. But that has not been true in my life, and it hasn't been true in most of my friends lives. Growing up, we were ridiculed when we attempted to participate in our culture. So all we're asking now is that people do it in a respectful way. Take time to understand what it is they're incorporating and don't turn it into the costume.   I can't really comment on your second point because that's not the interpretation I got from those comments."
brownbeauty,37qcuz,HollaDude,3,Fri May 29 18:01:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying individual desis don't face racism, I'm sure they do, But Indians in the US still use henna in weddings, still wear traditional clothing at weddings and in California at least, I see Indians wearing traditional clothing in the streets all the time. My university's Indian club held a Diwali gathering every year with people of Indian and non-Indian origin wearing their traditional clothing and no one cared. I take exception to the notion that you have the right to demand that people learn about the origins of the bindi/henna/sari before they wear it because 1) even desis don't know that, 2) it's not within your right to demand that. You don't own the culture, no one does.   And I can definitely make the claim that systemic racism isn't a thing for desis. They are the most educated in the US, have a median income of $88000 when the average is $49 800 and are responsible for creating 52% of the start ups in silicon valley. I'm not saying that you can't face racism or meet racist people, even I've met a few BUT you will not face systemic racism. A white person in the US may go to a black majority school and encounter racism but that doesn't mean that white people face systemic discrimination. Same goes for us. The numbers speak for themselves, Indians in the US aren't being systematically discriminated against as a group."
brownbeauty,37qcuz,culturalappropriator,13,Sat May 30 03:04:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think any of those instances prove that racism doesn't exist though. Like yea, when Indians are around other Indians they feel safe enough to express their own culture. I don't really want to argue about that though. We could go back and forth with statistics for ages. I don't think it's quite the same as a white person at an black school.    I take exception to the notion that you have the right to demand that people learn about the origins of the bindi/henna/sari before they wear it because 1) even desis don't know that, 2) it's not within your right to demand that. You don't own the culture, no one does.   If that's your opinion then that's fine, but I don't think of it as me demanding anything of white people. Like I'm not going to go out and hunt them down if they don't, it just bothers me that's all. I just want them to know something as simple as the bindi comes from India and it's a religious symbol for Hindus. I don't think that's complicated. I think if you're going to participate in cultural appreciation instead of appropriation, you need to know a bit of the context in order to appreciate it."
brownbeauty,37qcuz,HollaDude,0,Sat May 30 04:38:31 2015 UTC,"I never said racism doesn't exist, I said that most desis I've met, myself included, would feel safe wearing Indian clothing around Americans. I haven't met anyone who didn't know the bindi comes from India and as for the religious symbol part, the tilak maybe, but you can't possibly argue that fashion bindis aren't a thing, Either way, making the claim that white people can't use bindis/henna because it's an unequal exchange bothers me a lot because I don't feel that Indian culture is portrayed as lesser than American culture nor do I feel that Indians are oppressed in the US. Saying that a single white girl who decides to wear a henna tattoo without knowing where it's from cause any damage to Indians or Indian culture bothers and offends me because it holds the patronizing assumption that Desis hold no power at all, and are helpless children who need to be protected."
brownbeauty,37qcuz,culturalappropriator,2,Sat May 30 04:54:31 2015 UTC,"I never said racism doesn't exist   Actually, that's almost exactly what you said. You said there is no systemic discrimination against Desis in the US:    There is no systematic discrimination of desis in the US.   Also, a lot of the wording in the comments referred to Indian culture being somehow demeaned or made lesser by white people using it without ""knowing its proper significance"". That's not the same argument as being a minority in a majority culture. And it's something that doesn't just involve desis in the US.   I don't feel that Indian culture is portrayed as lesser than American culture nor do I feel that Indians are oppressed in the US.    You may not feel that way, but I do, and apparently a lot of other people do. The fact that some people are not bothered by it does not ""cancel out"" the people who are bothered by it."
brownbeauty,37qcuz,KrakatoaSpelunker,-1,Sat May 30 05:05:01 2015 UTC,"Systemic racism is one type of racism, I said Desis do not face systemic discrimination which isn't the same as individual Desis experiencing racism. Just because you feel something doesn't make it true. a lot of desis clearly feel the same way I do from the comments on the original page and here. This isn't about cancelling out your feelings, it's about you claiming that you have the right to tell other people what they can and can't do. Some desis don't think it's an issue, some do. But only one of us is trying to control the behavior of others."
brownbeauty,37qcuz,culturalappropriator,6,Sat May 30 05:24:43 2015 UTC,"responsible for creating 52% of the start ups in silicon valley.. The numbers speak for themselves, Indians in the US aren't being systematically discriminated against as a group.    If they are responsible for creating 52% of the startups in the Valley, they should be responsible for over half of the startups that receive funding, half that have successful exits, and even half of the coverage of startups on TechCrunch and the like.   But they're not. They are incredibly disproportionately underrepresented in all three of those categories, so your own data suggests that there is systemic bias at play here, whether explicit or implicit."
brownbeauty,37qcuz,KrakatoaSpelunker,0,Sat May 30 05:33:47 2015 UTC,"You do realize that tech crunch covers the world's startup companies, not just the US and certainly not Silicon Valley. At any rate, I misread the 52% part, here's the actual quote from the article:  ""The results were astonishing.  Twenty five percent of the nation‚Äôs startups and 52% of those in Silicon Valley were founded by immigrants. Indian immigrants were the leading company founding group. They founded 13.4% of Silicon Valley‚Äôs startups and 6.5% of those nationwide.  This was particularly surprising, because Indian immigrants comprised much less than 1% of U.S. population at the time.""  So Indians are responsible for 6.5% of the nation's start-ups. And TechCrunch covers a worldwide audience. Unless you have data that shows that the percentage of start-ups that end up being successful is disproportionately less that 5%, you're going to have to try harder than that at finding an example of systemic discrimination."
brownbeauty,37qcuz,culturalappropriator,3,Sat May 30 06:14:26 2015 UTC,"You do realize that tech crunch covers the world's startup companies, not just the US and certainly not Silicon Valley.   Well, yes, but TechCrunch has a very heavy bias towards Silicon Valley (and also the rest of the US). In any case, let's pretend you're correct for a moment and TechCrunch should be representative coverage of the world's startups.   Unless you have data that shows that the percentage of start-ups that end up being successful is disproportionately less that 5%   I don't know where you're getting the 5% figure, or why you're now drawing the bar at  ""successful"", since that's nowhere in the data you're citing.   So Indians are responsible for 6.5% of the nation's start-ups. And TechCrunch covers a worldwide audience.   Indians are a far larger percentage of the worldwide population than they are in the US population. By your logic, TechCrunch should be covering far more than 6.5% if there is no systemic bias against them."
brownbeauty,37qcuz,KrakatoaSpelunker,-2,Sat May 30 14:12:57 2015 UTC,"Indians may be a larger percentage of the world population but they don't account for a large percentage of worldwide start ups.

brownbeauty,37qcuz,culturalappropriator,3,Sat May 30 16:03:46 2015 UTC,"There is no systematic discrimination of desis in the US. In fact they are one of the the more affluent groups in terms of education and wealth.    This is very, very false. First of all, just because you haven't experienced it doesn't mean that others haven't. There are certainly black people who would make this claim, and that doesn't mean that there isn't systemic discrimination against black people in the US.   Secondly, the fact that Desis are wealthier and more educated than some other minority groups has to do with the fact that black people were literally brought over in chains into slavery, whereas Indian people in the US generally (a) came over voluntarily, and (b) survived a visa application process that is explicitly biased towards wealth and education by design.   That's bias and discrimination from the start, and all that's even before you set foot in the country."
brownbeauty,37qcuz,KrakatoaSpelunker,-3,Sat May 30 14:28:11 2015 UTC,"Systemic discrimination is patterns of behaviour, policies or practices that are part of the structures of an organization, and which create or perpetuate disadvantage for racialized persons..  Whether Desis are more educated or not, if systemic discrimination existed, they wouldn't be able to outperform their white counterparts. For example, this wouldn't happen. In NASA, 36% or almost 4 out of 10 scientists are Indians. 34% employees at Microsoft, 28% at IBM, 17% at Intel and 13% at Xerox are Indians.  There is no evidence that the system in place discriminates against Indians, i.e makes it harder for them to get into college, makes it harder for them to get a job or makes them targeted by police. If you have evidence to the contrary, I'd like to see it."
brownbeauty,37qcuz,culturalappropriator,4,Sat May 30 16:27:36 2015 UTC,"Whether Desis are more educated or not, if systemic discrimination existed, they wouldn't be able to outperform their white counterparts.   This is patently false, regardless of what racial, religious, or social group you are talking about. ""If X outperforms Y [by some metric], then Y does not discriminate against X"" is a logical fallacy, plain and simple.   . In NASA, 36% or almost 4 out of 10 scientists are Indians. 34% employees at Microsoft, 28% at IBM, 17% at Intel and 13% at Xerox are Indians.[2]    Again, Indians in the US are already subject to selection bias, given the fact that the visa application process is explicitly biased towards wealth and education. You can't deny that, because it's an open and admitted fact. You can't ignore that if you're trying to compare the number of Indians in a given job, especially when Indians outnumber Americans worldwide by four-to-one and there is an incredibly low immigration rate compared to the number of applicants.   There is no evidence that the system in place discriminates against Indians, i.e makes it harder for them to get into college,   Okay, there's plenty of evidence of this, and there was even a lawsuit about this some years ago.

I have seen countless occasions where Indians are absolutely thrilled to share their culture with others, be it clothes, food, traditions, festivals, jewelry etc etc..  I have several non-desi members in my family and we would buy Salwar sets, Kurtas, Dhotis, tons of bangles & Bindis for them throughout the years.  They loved wearing everything and also learned Bhangra and Dandiya to join in all the wedding celebrations. Is that wrong or appropriative? I don't think so.  We have really got to stop being so touchy & ready to fight over religion & culture.. it really beats the whole core of every religion I can think of.  If I put on Geisha makeup and walked around trying to mimic in a Japanese accent that would be awful, stupid and racist for sure.. But If I put on the Geisha makeup for a decent picture..is that wrong?? I don't think so.  I think it is just an expression of appreciation & dedication towards learning of an art form. Not so different from taking a Salsa or Karate class.  Overall we just need to chill out about these things..there are worse problems in this world that we should be offended by. :(  Well that is what I had to say to folks that actually felt offended by that post. I do think they had the right to express their opinion and should not have been so severely downvoted but that is the way of reddit."
brownbeauty,37qcuz,jingabobo,5,Fri May 29 17:57:37 2015 UTC,"I really wish White People would stop being offended for me. I'm not Indian, so my opinions about whether or not it's appropriation are largely irrelevant. I only care if someone who is Indian is or is not offended by it, and I'd love to hear their thoughts about why that is so I can learn.   It is absolutely not my place to shoot my mouth off about a culture I know nothing about just so I can get upvotes for being so socially minded.

I think all this cultural appropriation is a western construct, created by people with too much time in their hands. If you were to take a poll in India about non Indian people wearing bindis and such, you'd not get such a reaction from even one person."

You haven't been oppressed, you don't know what it's like to be a minority. Cultural appropriation deals with the exploitation of a minority culture by a majority culture, and it's something that's really prominent in America because America is a country of immigrants.   Most of the problems that people have with cultural appropriation have to do with the fact that they themselves cannot participate in their own culture without facing discrimination, but someone who is white can. That's not something you've ever experienced.   Everyone has different opinions on cultural appropriation, and that's fine. The whole controversy in that thread wasn't even about cultural appropriation, but the fact that you should be allowed to discuss it without being down-voted.   Dismissing the conversation by saying ""well Indians in India don't care"" is not appropriate."

I don't see any of the concerns about cultural appropriation as legitimate. I find it all pretty absurd to be honest. Last year the media had images and videos of henna being put on pregnant bellies and showcased some indian women had henna decorations made o  their stomach. Now that's unusual and raised a few eyebrows, but most people just shrugged and moved on.  How annoying to have a whole argument and unnecessary discussion about 'cultural appropriation' where it isn't really even an issue. Go be self righteous somewhere else."

brownbeauty,37joyl,glaceauglaceau,1 point,Thu May 28 14:41:12 2015 UTC,"Hey! I'm probably in the area of NC40-42 myself, so hopefully this will help :) I have ashy, greenish undertones and surface yellowness myself, so I laboured under the impression that I was warm for years, but only realised that I was neutral-cool recently: all the warm foundations made my skin look orangey and ashy. If this sounds like you, then try a neutral foundation. If not, and you're certain that you're warm, then I would certainly recommend bareMinerals! My similarly-toned sister uses Golden Tan in the Ready pressed foundation and it pulls warm enough for most Indian skin tones :) Another good place to try for our skin tone is Clinique- they have a wide range of warmer foundations as the whole line skews a little warm.  Good luck!"
brownbeauty,37joyl,Snarkcissist,2,Thu May 28 07:01:12 2015 UTC,"You make a really good point; sometimes I think these makeup artists just automatically match up WOC to ""warm"" undertones without really taking a look. I recently wasted 27 bucks on mac face and body foundation cause the MUA swore up and down C5 was the right shade for me. I should have returned it but a part of me just wanted to keep trying to make the product work.   Anyhow, I will be stopping by my bare escentuals store and trying some shades out. If that doesn't work, I'll have to try more neutral foundations. Thank you!"

brownbeauty,37b8wv,betafrogg,4,Tue May 26 10:21:53 2015 UTC,"L'Oreal Correcting Primer in Green  I've used the orange one for years now and it's a great, lightweight but buildable coverage. I think with color correcting, people need a darker correcter than their skin tone to help fully cover pigmentation-- this might work for your skin tone, which is really quite a mid tone medium.   You might also try this: NYX concealer in green   Again, I've used the orange version of this faithfully for years now. It's a little tricky because this concealer does settle into lines, but if you set really well with powder/let it dry before you apply foundation over, it works very well! They also have a new darker green primer here you go! that I haven't tried yet, but I imagine if you use it as a spot corrector, instead of an all over primer, it will work very well."

brownbeauty,36ps77,chiffonandheels,8,Thu May 21 16:25:13 2015 UTC,Mind sharing a picture of you?   It depends a lot on your coloring and what kind of clothing style you wear. In my opinion you can't go wrong with your natural hair color plus some caramel balayage style highlights.

Natural colors:   All over caramel highlights Chunky red-brown highlights on the top layer of my hair Drugstore demi-permanent color all over. I used an auburn color and it gave me a reddish sheen in the sunshine   Unnatural colors:   Bleached my whole head and dyed it bright purple.  Bleached a piece of hair near my middle part and dyed it fuchsia (my favorite look from over the years) Put blood red dye over the previously mentioned caramel highlights."
brownbeauty,36ps77,motor_mouth,2,Thu May 21 12:58:02 2015 UTC,"There are some great ideas in this thread. I tend to get my ideas from youtube music videos like kpop videos, since those artists tend to have natural hair color similar to mine, even if my skin color might be darker.  Anjulie's hair in ""You and I"" is my forever goal.  Hers looks like it was dyed all over then grown out. My hairstylist friend does my hair and this year we are (quite literally) working our way ""up"" to more blondeness.  (1) I started with a few streaks of a light caramel blond all over, underneath the top layer... meaning if my hair was down, the streaks would peek through the layers, but the hair all over my head that you could see is my natural dark color.  (2) ombre streaks, this time a light orangey brown blond, all over my head. My hair goes down to about my bra strap/the middle of my back, and the streaks go up to about my shoulders with some areas that go much higher. My hair is naturally wavy so ombre works just fine.  (3) Next month I'm hoping to take the color even higher up the hair shaft, almost to my roots, and get it even closer to a golden platinum, like in the video. I love the look of grown out hair color but I don't want to actually dye my whole head and wait for it to grow out, haha."

Why would the Sharks invest in an oversaturated market that has giant industry leaders like L'Oreal & Revlon that can do the very same thing at any given time?  Also, I've seen this Brand on Hautelook plenty of times.They have been at it long enough to have made it by now.  If it was truly a great/Novel product it would have taken off by now. I'm not saying the product is bad, its just not unique enough or reasonably priced enough to sell well in the current market.

brownbeauty,35wqtl,fivetenths,2,Fri May 15 16:51:22 2015 UTC,I've been using it for about a month. I'm NC42 and it hasn't made me look ghostly at all. Really great for setting concealer under the eyes! I've never been a big user of translucent powders until I bought this powder. Never going back now!
brownbeauty,35wqtl,chiffonandheels,2,Thu May 14 12:46:55 2015 UTC,Thank you for convincing me lol
brownbeauty,35wqtl,monkeybutt10,3,Thu May 14 15:15:05 2015 UTC,"I use the CoverFX Matte Setting Powder which I think works well with my foundation powder (also from them). I haven't found the exact match just yet so when I brush on the setting powder (deep shade), it really seems to even out."
brownbeauty,35wqtl,monkeybutt10,1 point,Thu May 14 04:59:45 2015 UTC,Thank you I'll look into it
brownbeauty,35wqtl,monkeybutt10,3,Thu May 14 15:13:48 2015 UTC,"I love the L'Oreal Translucent setting powder-- I've heard the LM translucent is really good though, I know it leaves flashback on darker skin tones in the NC47 beyond range."
brownbeauty,35qxir,msqualah,2,Tue May 12 19:50:27 2015 UTC,Your voice is so lovely and clear! I'm definitely going to try this out. :)

brownbeauty,35j34z,betafrogg,3,Sun May 10 21:34:46 2015 UTC,"I love indies, but yall know that.  Blackbird makes, hands down, the best matte eyeshadows and I will fight anyone who says different (not really).  Her Skulpting contour powder in Remove is my HG contour.  I've never tried Uponaworld's shop, but she's on my list.    Shiro was my gateway into indies and still makes up the largest part of my collection.  They also make my HG gloss formula and the fact that I can get in a custom mixed color for a little over $10 is amazing.  Fyrinnae is hard to shop but so worth it.  Their Liquid Matte lipsticks are always out of stock it seems but if you catch one of Dorian's ninja restocks they're worth grabbing.  Also, don't be afraid of their TAT.  It's something ridiculous like 5 weeks so that there's no way they'll go over it, but in reality every order I've made has shipped within 10 days.    My new favorite bath and body company is actually WOC owned.  Kheimistrii makes whipped soaps thick enough to shave with but won't dry you out and lotions thick enough to keep my dry skin moisturized even in the winter.  I could go on and on."
brownbeauty,35j34z,frumperbell,2,Mon May 11 19:05:39 2015 UTC,"Have you tried Haus of Gloi pumpkin butters and/or body emulsions? If so, how do Kheimistrii's lotions compare to those?"
brownbeauty,35j34z,motor_mouth,1 point,Mon May 11 19:33:37 2015 UTC,"I haven't tried the body emulsions yet, but I have tried the Pumpkin Butter.  Personally, I prefer Kheimistrii.  I can't tell the difference between her Souffle and Buttercream; both are thick and rich and moisturize without feeling greasy.  HoG is slightly less thick, but it feels just as nice as Kheimistrii's does.  I don't think you'd go wrong with either one, honestly.  So helpful, I know.  :D"
brownbeauty,35j34z,frumperbell,2,Mon May 11 19:43:02 2015 UTC,"Cool, I will give them a try. I love the Pumpkin Butters and the Body Emulsion is a nice lighter version of that but I want to try more scents."
brownbeauty,35j34z,motor_mouth,1 point,Mon May 11 20:05:42 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking about trying the Body Emulation this summer since it sounds like it'd be lighter and it comes unscented.  Sometimes I don't want to worry about layering or matching scents, especially if i'm going for some of my more out there indie perfumes."
brownbeauty,35j34z,frumperbell,2,Mon May 11 20:13:50 2015 UTC,"The PB comes in unscented as well and yeah, I hear you on the layering."
brownbeauty,35j34z,motor_mouth,2,Mon May 11 20:18:21 2015 UTC,"I order from abroad a lot, so waiting up to two months for something isn't unusual... Long and fraught with manic reloading of tracking sites, but no unusual XD  There's SO much I want to order including some matte lips from Fyrinnae, but I've decided on Life's Entropy next, mainly for the yellow foundation tint- have you tried any of them?  I might look into body lotion type stuff when my currant The Body Shop body butters run out, but honestly I'm more inclined to make my own, shipping to the UK of larger indie cosmetics is kinda prohibitive and I'm keen to infuse my own scents into things.   Do you have any recommendations for liquid/ cream/ tint blushes? I'm all about them right now, they just sit much better on me."
brownbeauty,35j34z,frumperbell,2,Mon May 11 20:53:25 2015 UTC,"Yes actually.  I can't believe I forgot to list them since I'm wearing them today.  I have their Animal Sanctuary eye shadow collection, which is a lovely neutral collection with a few pops of wearable color.  The Brow Theory Pomade is a bang on dupe for dipbrow.  Dark Brown is a match for Ebony dippie and is my new HG brow product.  I have three of the Lip Theories, but I've only tried out Big Bang so far.  I like them a lot but they're fiddly:  you need lip liner under and to apply with a lip brush.  I'm lazy so usually I can't be bothered.    I got a sample of the Particle Contour Stick in Quark and its dark enough for me and works really well.     I haven't tried the foundation mixers but I hear good things.  EDIT: forgot to add I haven't really tried any indie cream/liquid blushes.  I don't really know too many indie shops that do non powder blushes.  Off the top of my head there's Darling Girl."
brownbeauty,35j34z,motor_mouth,2,Mon May 11 21:13:53 2015 UTC,"Particle Contour Stick in Quark   I got gift/swoped a bit of Neutrino, which kinda id the trick, but I'm thinking Neutron would be better on me... I might get a sample too. I do like how easy it is to blend out.   I shall have a look at DG, Thanks!"
brownbeauty,35j34z,motor_mouth,3,Tue May 12 17:02:04 2015 UTC,Yes! I have a bunch of mattes from Blackbird and all the Art Nouvea blushes from Baroque. I also have a couple of eyeshadows from Hello Waffle.

brownbeauty,35j34z,motor_mouth,3,Mon May 11 20:39:51 2015 UTC,"Magic summoning powers! No, the Japanese fashion palettes are taking awhile because I'm working on a matte formula for one of them and it's being rather difficult!

brownbeauty,35j34z,motor_mouth,1 point,Mon May 11 21:02:52 2015 UTC,What's your skin tone?- How do you find the blushes? I'm seriously eyeing the Klimt Eastwood (and some of the corals) from Baroque!
brownbeauty,35j34z,nicheeee,2,Mon May 11 20:38:41 2015 UTC,"They are very blendable and soft. I do have to be careful to not overapply, but I think that is an issue with any loose powder brush. I use the RT blush brush to apply. Some of the colors are more flattering than others but I also like weird/unusual makeup (even though I can't wear it to school...alas). Are you interested in swatches?"
brownbeauty,35j34z,nicheeee,1 point,Mon May 11 20:42:38 2015 UTC,"Euuugh, the worst is when I apply in the bathroom bathroom, then go out into the world and have to dab off some blush because my bathroom is kinda dim XD   Yes! Always interested in swatches!"

brownbeauty,35j34z,dratthecookies,2,Tue May 12 16:38:46 2015 UTC,"It's about an NC45 (I've never been officially matched at MAC). It's pretty close to my face, though a touch less red. My perfect match is Bobbi Brown foundation stick in Honey."
brownbeauty,35iw3d,Brompton_Cocktail,15,Sun May 10 20:32:10 2015 UTC,"NARS blushes, because of the amazing pigmentation and smoothness."
brownbeauty,35iw3d,motor_mouth,6,Sun May 10 21:54:18 2015 UTC,"High-end eyeliner. Seriously. I got a Marc Jacobs eyeliner pen and it was glorious. Unfortunately I can't afford it so when it ran out I didn't repurchase, but God, high-end eyeliner is amazing."
brownbeauty,35iw3d,stufstuf,1 point,Sun May 10 21:08:37 2015 UTC,Yaaaas! Lancome Artliner <3 I've yet to find a lower end dupe.
brownbeauty,35iw3d,honeybuttery,5,Mon May 11 19:03:34 2015 UTC,"I think high end eyeshadows are really worth it. My only truly high end shadows are Chanel, but Tom Ford has a better reputation for eyeshadows. I love my Chanel quad anyway, but the powder ones are a little sheer. The cream shadows are everything.     I love Chanel's Sylo Yeaux Waterproof Eye Pencil. Great for tightlining.    YSL lip products, in general, are definitely worth it.    I've raved about Guerlain bronzers to you before, but they still deserve the consideration."
brownbeauty,35iw3d,ibby_be,1 point,Sun May 10 21:25:21 2015 UTC,Which shade do you use in the Guerlain bronzer? It's always been my HG for three years now and now with ny focus on skincare and diligent sunscreen use I don't tan as much and I am finding it too red :/  Just wanted to add I have both the Terracotta and 4 Seasons in the darkest shade - Ebony.
brownbeauty,35iw3d,honeybuttery,1 point,Mon May 11 16:55:26 2015 UTC,"Is use 05 Moyen Brunettes. I find those bottom two shades to look pretty red on me, so I can only use them alone if I'm tanned, which is almost never. So most of the time I use the top two on my face, and I'll use the bottom two for crease colors. The top two shades are my go-to every day bronzing shades, because they lean more golden than red. That's what I go for when I want to look 'lit from within.' If I just feel like looking sunkissed, that's when I use all 4."
brownbeauty,35iw3d,ibby_be,1 point,Mon May 11 17:04:35 2015 UTC,Thanks! Maybe I'll pick that one up.
brownbeauty,35iw3d,fluffywaffles_,3,Mon May 11 17:09:58 2015 UTC,"What do you have in mind?   Tom Ford makes great blushes, concealer, eyeliner and brow pencils. For these products, seriously don't waste your time with other lines.  YSL makes good lipsticks but be careful when swatching because the colors often look different when you're in natural light. Their eyeliner is rubbish, don't bother.  Guerlain rouge G lipsticks live up to the hype. Their ballz are a nice to have more than a necessity. Common complaint is they're too sparkly, which is valid. From my experience their maxi lash mascara sucks. You will be hard pressed to find a primer that is better than what they offer.  KA is known for his sensual skin enhancer and I'm on the fence about it. Decent coverage but it's oil based so for me it can feel gross if it's humid. Some products are being sold at a discount at myhabit.com so I'd suggest taking a look there to get your feet wet with this line.  For HE eyeshadow, I like hourglass and givenchy. Givenchy came out with a new loose powder that's an amazing alternative to guerlain balls you should look into.  This is all off the top of my head. Let me know if you have any more specific  questions! Hope this helps."
brownbeauty,35iw3d,briewedge,2,Mon May 11 13:40:03 2015 UTC,"YSL's Volume Effet Faux Cils mascara is my absolute favorite - weightless, clump-free, and lightly perfumed. I also love that when I rub my eyes my lashes feel soft, not spiky."
brownbeauty,35iw3d,ReformedTomboy,2,Sun May 10 23:32:59 2015 UTC,"Nars Blushes, to me, are the best overall. D&G also has great blushes, Mocha is my go to everyday blush  For Mascaras I personally think drugstore is just fine, high end is better but not enough to justify the price in most cases, IMO.  That being said Benefit's There Real, Diorshow, and Dior Show Blackout are my favorites.  Dior mascara period are great.  Also Lance Hypnoses Drama is amazing!  YSL has some excellent lip products, Rouge Volupe Shine are my favorites because they are incredibly moisturizing.  Their Gloss Volupte lipgloss comes in a wide range and are very moiturising and smell amazing.  Personally, with the exception of Costal Scents, I only use high end eyeshadows.  Urban Decay is the best brand for that, to me.  The new Hourglass eyeshadow palettes are very buttery with good pigmentation so I would check those out as well."
brownbeauty,35iw3d,Anne_of_Avonlea,2,Mon May 11 18:25:02 2015 UTC,"I've talked about the meteorites before. I just don't even understand what effect they're supposed to have, I saw no visible difference on my face.     I used to buy quite a bit of high end makeup and tbh I don't like a lot of it. Mostly because the sales associates have no idea how to pick products/colour recs for us.     Some of the few products I do love are Burberry lipsticks and Guerlain/NARS blush. Chanel blushes are also nice, but it's harder to get good colours for dark skin."
brownbeauty,35iw3d,waldening,1 point,Thu May 14 19:40:39 2015 UTC,"I really love Bobbi Brown smokey eye mascara (same price as the ""high end mascara"" I would recommend, YSL original faux cils, though I love the BB far more).  We have similar color matches so these may be worth a look... I was super blown away by Lancome translucence powder recently (I am shade 400). Tom Ford also makes very yellow undertoned foundations, there is also an illuminating primer in the line that I liked. Look into By Terry as well, I was at a counter and some of the colors were like magic on my face. There was a tinted cc cream that was really nice but sold out. Very fragranced though."

brownbeauty,35bjuk,jikajika,8,Fri May 8 19:06:24 2015 UTC,"This lipstick...lacquer...whatever you want to call it brings me to LIFE! I just found out that you can get this liquid lipstick along with Mirabella eyeshadow, Revlon mascara, Cargo blush, and BB Cream/Tinted moisturizer HERE for $15 (and I pay that much for two tubes of lipstick)   This liquid lipstick ALONE, imo, is worth the collection. You apply it in it's liquid form and within seconds it dries to this BRILLIANT matte finish! It is OPAQUE, a little goes a LONG way, it's not streaky, and it doesn't dry out your lips like some other matte lipsticks do. Also, it's light. I barely notice it's on - especially when I smile.   So $15, 5 great products, put together for the ladies with melanin, by OnyxBeat and sponsored by OnyxBox! Cheers!"

She liked it and said that it:   looks almost exactly like Soleil Tan de Chanel on my NC 42 skin.   And if you're looking for other options, in her review of the new Mac Wash and Dry Collection bronzers she mentioned that she uses the Guerlain Terracotta 4 Seasons."
brownbeauty,354rh2,whythehecknot,2,Thu May 7 06:10:34 2015 UTC,"For a straight up bronzer, I can't recommend the Guerlain enough. The Chanel is beautiful, but I'm getting the idea that Karen uses it as a blush?"

brownbeauty,354rh2,honeybuttery,2,Thu May 7 13:23:53 2015 UTC,"When I bought mine (the 4 Seasons Teracotta), I (quite stupidly) didn't realize that it was $76, as compared to the $53 that I was ready to spend. I spent a few weeks just not touching it, telling myself  that I was gonna return it. Then I just decided to use it and I never looked back. If it helps you at all, I've used it almost every day for maybe 2 months and it still looks untouched. But I kept the 4 Seasons because it's customizable. At my normal skin tone, I just swirl the top 2 shades together. I'll often throw the darkest shade in my crease if I'm in a hurry. And if I'm a little darker, or if I want a stronger bronzed look, I can swirl all 4 shades together or the bottom 2. So I really don't need another bronzer."

brownbeauty,3525pd,mishmash27,12,Wed May 6 14:01:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly, rather than use it as a contour, I use bronzer as a blush (NW35 here). It gives a warmth and glow to the face the same way a blush does, but also a bit of that duskiness that you want from those goldeny browns. It'll make your cheekbones pop. Give it a shot, I swear, it looks so great on darker skins. I use a basic body shop bronzer."
brownbeauty,3525pd,BabyMcHaggis,4,Wed May 6 15:00:47 2015 UTC,I do that a lot in the summer months.  Especially if I'm wearing a red/bright lip.  My faves are Milani's Bellisimo Bronze and Black Radiance's Gingersnap
brownbeauty,3525pd,frumperbell,6,Wed May 6 19:37:09 2015 UTC,The chance of an NW45 finding a bronzer dark enough to actually be a contour color is pretty slim. Covergirl ebony bronze is nice but it has a lot of red undertones. I would honestly suggest a dark matte brown eyeshadow
brownbeauty,3525pd,Theokeydoke,6,Wed May 6 19:05:08 2015 UTC,"Too Faced's Dark Chocolate Soleil Matte Bronzer seems to work fairly well for darker skin. I'm NW45 as well, and for the few times i've contoured my face (okay, the ONE time i've contoured...) it stayed pretty well. Didn't melt, helped me look less oily, and it smells AMAZING."
brownbeauty,3525pd,mycarebeardontcare,3,Wed May 6 14:52:32 2015 UTC,"It might well be too orange, but that will depend on the bronzer you're using. For contour, you want something slightly cooler toned, so it looks more realistic as a shadow. Also, make sure there isn't any shimmer in it. If you're looking for a reasonably priced contour product, I'd suggest the Sleek contour kit that also contains a highlighter. I'm NC42ish and use medium, which I think would work for you."
brownbeauty,3525pd,l0l0lol0l0l,3,Wed May 6 16:24:07 2015 UTC,"I may be a bit darker than you are but I've been using MAC Blunt blush to contour, it's really nice and you can build up the color to however intense you like your contour. I find bronzers are better blush or like a summer glow if its glittery."

brownbeauty,3525pd,frumperbell,3,Thu May 7 03:41:45 2015 UTC,"I've found that most traditional bronzers are too warm to contour with.  What works on my NC50 skin is Sleek's Contour Kit.  It's a UK brand, but their website has reasonable international shipping or you can find it on Amazon.  I also like Blackbird Cosmetics' Skulpting Powder.  Remove is my favorite, but Reduce and Subtract also work for dark skin.  If you'd rather a cream contour, Life's Entropy's Particle Stick in Quark is a WOC friendly shade."

It hasn't been mentioned but the Shea moisture bronzer in Mandalay dusk is a favorite. If you're in the U.S. You can get that at target. As far as sleek if you're in the U.S. You can get it on amazon but it takes a month for shipping. It will be dark enough though. If you don't have super oily skin check out the cover fx cream contour kit or even some Mac nc/nw  55 concealers.

I also go with super long wearing products in case I get nervous and start to sweat or anything.   I had a couple interviews last week and went with matte foundation (NARS all day luminous weightless). I did a neutral eye - matte taupe/beige color tattoo all over and a slightly darker matte crease. Tightline, and a tiny bit of liner on the lids. I used ""my lips but better"" long wearing lipcolor. I stuck to matte blush and a very slightly glowy highlighter. And I used a very light  hand in filling in the brows. I set everything with the powder buffing method and followed up with setting spray."

I'm also have hyper-pigmentation (I'm black) and I'm recently started using some Asian beauty products. My skin has evened out some and it hasn't lightened my skin so I'm happy!

In fact most company accounts get special flair which identifies them as a company rep.

Then apply concealer and set with a powder. For body though a heavy duty setting spray works really well to stop transfer to clothes.

Girl both have good affordable concealers, although L.A. Girl's shade range is better than NYX's.  If you have a hard time finding either, check out beauty supply stores.    If you want to get rid of them though, try Ambi Fade Cream.  That stuff is magic.  Just make sure you wear sunscreen over it or it won't be as effective."

It's kinda overwhelming - lots to know! - but the results amazed me.  Personally, chemical exfoliation with AHA, a vitamin C serum, a Korean snail filtrate gel cream and rosehip seed oil helped me out a lot with post inflammatory hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and generally uneven skin tone. Each one of these products would probably have been good enough on their own, but I was being impatient.   I've received a few compliments from my dad and a few friends without me mentioning a change in my skincare routine."
brownbeauty,33nycd,SailorMercure,2,Fri Apr 24 05:56:34 2015 UTC,What was your routine? Just curious :) I've been getting some good results with the Ole Henriksen Lemon Strip Flash peel but it's soo pricey.
brownbeauty,33nycd,ArchitortureGirl,5,Fri Apr 24 19:12:50 2015 UTC,"I used to use Ole Henriksen products (a salesgirl at Sephora recommended a gift set of travel sized Ole Henriksen products). It made my skin even drier and I started to flake wherever whenever.  My routine is based on the Asian mutiple-steps routine, so it will seem overwhelming :  AM   Oil cleansing : Mineral oil (unscented baby oil). Foam cleansing : CeraVe Foaming Cleanser, for normal to dry skin. pH adjusting toner : Eucerin DermatoCLEAN Clarifying Toner. Vitamin C serum : Cosmedica's Hydra-C Serum 20% (also contains ferulic acid, vitamin e and hyaluronic acid : vitamin C fades PIH, ferulic acid stabilizes vitamin C and makes it up to 90% more efficient at fading PIH) Hydrating toner : Rohto Hadalabo Gokujyn Hyaluronic Acid Lotion (Moist) Medium-weight moisturizer : CeraVe Evening Facial Lotion (contains niacinamide, which is good for PIH fading) Medium-weight moisturizer (and treatment) : Mizon Multi Funtion Snail Recovery Cream Gel (snail secretion filtrate is starting to get known for speeding skin's healing process, minimizing pimples and fading PIH) Heavy-weight moisturizer : Natysal Rosehip Oil Cream (rosehip oil brightens skin, moisturizes and minimizes fine lines) Sunscreen: mine is leaving a white cast on my face. I'm not recommending it.   PM  The four first steps are the same. Between Vitamin C serum and the hydrating toner, I use Alpha Hydroxy Enhanced Lotion AHA 10% (exfoliation), instead of using rosehip oil cream, I use pure rosehip oil and instead of sunscreen, I use good old regular Vaseline."

brownbeauty,33nycd,SailorMercure,2,Sun Apr 26 14:22:12 2015 UTC,"I can vouch for the Biore sunscreen. It's like none of the sunscreens I've ever tried. There's no whitecast what's so ever. Melts into your face, no greasy feeling. It's easy to apply the proper 1/4 tsp amount, unlike other sunscreens where I would have to work that amount in."

If snail secretion filtrate is not your thing, another one I did like is CeraVe PM Moisturizing Facial Lotion. I did not mention it cause I wasn't thinking of it. Anyway.

Bring it up and definitely focus your contour towards the back of your cheekbone, near your ear. Don't make it so heavy down towards the apple.  Did you highlight right under the contour? It looks out of place, but I can't tell if that's the lighting or not. In any case if you did highlight there, make sure to blend it out or choose something closer to your skin tone.  Overall, great first attempt! Just make sure you blend blend blend."

brownbeauty,33ijjh,msqualah,2,Wed Apr 22 20:21:16 2015 UTC,"My cc of the video are:    the music in the very first section is louder than your voice so I can't hear what your saying.  12 odd minutes is for me a long time to go without much commentary.  I like when tutorials explain a bit about what/ why they're doing (method wise), what colours they're using- specific brand wise or a description of the colour they're using and possible alternatives, and tool/ brush choices and why.  On a much more personal level I love nails and would love to see make up recreation tutorials that also dupe varnish colours XD   I found the eye section the most interesting, I've wanted to do a grey look for a while but never thought about cooling it down a notch.  But I think I will try with a more coral/ orange lip and cheek as I'm really getting into those colours right now. I like the finished look, your skin looks fresh and your eyes stand out really well."
brownbeauty,33ijjh,betafrogg,2,Thu Apr 23 07:38:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks!!! Great feedback not harsh but constructive, Thanks! At this point I'm updating all of my equipment and going to change my schedule everything will be much better on production side. I have been loving the orange's this season, coral ehh not as much because I did a lot last summer with it, I just picked up wet n wild'sorange lipstick a month ago ...LOVING IT! Have you tried any of the multi use blush sticks??"
brownbeauty,33ijjh,betafrogg,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:59:28 2015 UTC,"YW- I look forward to seeing more from you :D  I recently figured that cream/ liquid blushes are my waty to go as they don't settle into my acne scars (I'm looking at you, worst offending, shimmery powder blush).   There was this Innisfree Neon Rouge Pot in Fresh Orange that I was coveting, finally decided to buy it on eBay and the seller refunded me, contacting me to say that it was out of stock, and now I can't find it anywhere :( It was lip + cheek too QQ So, still not tried any multi use blush!  Wet n Wild isn't easily available here in the UK, but I did just get the ColorIcon palette form an exchange in Comfort Zone and am very impressed.  The only orange lipstick I have is this one on the far left called Vice by Make Up Revolution, I was thinking to try it on my cheeks too.   What's the name of the WnW orange you have?"
brownbeauty,33ijjh,betafrogg,1 point,Thu Apr 23 22:30:14 2015 UTC,"WnW~ What up Doc #515D, I got another on the same day from wet and wild but this one is better, moisturizing.   The InnisFree looks nice tried it yet? How did you like it? Well I'm pretty sure there is nars over there they have a few GREAT STICKS! Don't know you spending range, but I will stay on the lookout for drug store brands from your side of the pond as well"
brownbeauty,33ijjh,betafrogg,1 point,Thu Apr 23 22:47:13 2015 UTC,"Oooh, that one looks nice.   I didn't try it, can't find it anywhere now QQ  Yeah, I can get to a NARS stand, I'm heading into town tomorrow so I might try and see if I can get a trial. I don't mind paying out for products if they're worth it quality/ longevity wise but right now I'm all TRY ALL THE COLOURS :D If you come across any cheaper version, please do let me know :D  I wish Sleek did cream blushers, I have some of the powder ones and they're gorgeous. If you're ever interested in a UK brand I'd recommend Sleek, they started out as a cosmetics company for black people in the UK, and have since expanded. A lot of their products including their blushes are well pigmented and show up without being ashy."

I will look and see if there s anything, But I will tell you the Nars Copacabana... Ithink that's how you spell it... Muy Bonita very beautiful and on you I think it would be perfect(Assuming you are the lady on the blog post) You are going to LOVE IT, its actually an illuminator but it is GORGEOUS!!! Orgasm (name of the makeup ;~) is great on just about any skin tone I would guess. Get those samples and I think you will LOVE IT!!!

I have a couple of dupes or Orgasm which I really like, but the issue I have with shimmery products anywhere on my face is the way they settle into my pitted acne scaring and highlight them :( So I'm pretty exclusively about exploring cream matte type blushers right now. :D"
brownbeauty,33ia7r,missfreshface,3,Wed Apr 22 19:13:04 2015 UTC,"I'm South Asian as well (around NC44)  and I ordered a few lippie stix about a month ago. I got 2 in ""crazier"" colors (for me at least) in Grind and I Heart This; and I got Lumiere as a neutral as well. I usually use mid-to-high end lip products and wasn't really expecting a lot, but I actually love these. I wear Lumiere at least a couple times a week now, it's a great every day shade. And I Heart This is such a beautiful pinky red color on my skintone. I do dab a little lip balm on top of them cause I feel like they dry out my lips if I don't, but the colors last for several hours! I definitely recommend trying a few, especially colors you just want to play around with and wouldn't necessarily purchase a more expensive version of yet!"

But, there are some really cool looking colors in there that are like, tens of dollars more at other places, so I'm not sure.   I've stayed away so far."

I got them off /r/makeupexchange though and paid $3 for each. Deciding on whether or not to take the plunge and buy some more. I like the colour payoff and I'm darker than you (NC 45-50) and I like them a lot. I'd say maybe just get one and decide from there.

brownbeauty,33icrh,Cananabanolism,3,Wed Apr 22 19:31:26 2015 UTC,"Are you using primer? L'Oreal Magic Decrease primer work wells for me.   The Maybelline Nudes is my favorite drugstore palette. The Nudes has a nice selection of both shimmer and matte, and since they're neutral shades, every eyeshadow in that palette is wearable.   Wet n Wild 'Comfort Zone' palette shows up nicely on my deep skin too. All of the eyeshadows in this palette are shimmery. If you're more into mattes, I'd go w/ the Nudes. IMO, Wet n Wild has the most pigmented eyeshadows in the drugstore."
brownbeauty,33icrh,toofacedjas,1 point,Wed Apr 22 21:02:40 2015 UTC,"I tried it with and without a primer over.

brownbeauty,33icrh,msqualah,5,Wed Apr 22 21:15:02 2015 UTC,"Lol I'm sorry for laughing but that it PRETTY BAD!!! SMH well DANG that's HORRIBLE!!! And that's not really an item you can return and get your money back either. Go for the 88, Maybelline or even loreal has one now... don't they?"

brownbeauty,33icrh,msqualah,2,Thu Apr 23 04:17:16 2015 UTC,Yea the nudes is nice! But have you tried a much lighter concealer and building the color? I've never tried the product but with this post Im almost a little disappointed because I like some NYX's products.
brownbeauty,33icrh,msqualah,1 point,Wed Apr 22 23:31:43 2015 UTC,"I'm disappointed too!! All the single color shadows they have are amazing, it's just this palette.   The third one down is supposed to look a little orange-y, and the first swipe in that swatch is supposed to be white. Those two colors don't show on me at all.   The third and second to last colors are supposed to be two different brown shadows.   (Sigh) I honestly wouldn't recommend it to anyone my skin tone. Plus the fact that it wipes off easily, even with primer, doesn't make it worth the buy either.   Also, I tried building the color and all it did was appear more chalky, the color never built up."
brownbeauty,33icrh,msqualah,3,Wed Apr 22 23:50:00 2015 UTC,GIrl... that's ridiculous! They selling smashed up chalk! SMH. Well I know for sure the Maybelline palette is good or you could get the 88 color neutral palette.
brownbeauty,33icrh,msqualah,2,Thu Apr 23 00:10:03 2015 UTC,"^ second that, the 88 neutral palette has every eyeshadow you'll ever need. some of the colors are a hit and miss, but there's so many colors I don't mind."

This would probably be more significant, and noticeable, if my hair was longer (give me a year or two), but my short hair will have to do for now.   So as you know, I twist my hair at night. So I decided to used the Lottabody Gelee, which smells delicious (HE said ;c>) I was not expecting the Gelee to be so light and waterbased. When I saw the name ""Gelee, I think it's going to have a gel-like consistency, harden my hair, etc. It is LIGHT, fluid, hydrating, it feels water based, a little goes a LONG way, it defines my curls without hardening them, and my favorite, it has next to no product residue feeling on your hands. Hazzah!  This Lottabody is winning in my book."

I use MAC fluid fix foundation (NC42), but I didn't want to take that with me to Europe so I bought this BB cream on a whim. I totally recommend it! Very light feeling, sheer coverage so easy it's to build up, and the color matches very well. My only problem with it is that it doesn't have any SPF in it (IDK if that's common in BB creams though).  The concealer is great too, but I would REALLY recommend that you set it with a powder.

I personally use Paula's Choice Resist Weekly Resurfacing Treatment with 10% AHA (serum) every 2/3 weeks though I strongly recommend starting at 1% or 2% or even samples available through the website. An important note, you absolutely must use a sunscreen 25+ SPF if you go the chemical peel route because it increases your skin's sensitivity to the sun."

Make SPF your #1 step, it can be tricky to find sunblock that works with your current makeup so pick up samples everywhere and try them out :)"

brownbeauty,32zw9b,jikajika,2,Sat Apr 18 03:34:08 2015 UTC,"Hey there everyone! This is my quick Sugar Skull look. For any black outlines, I used: Wet 'N Wild's gel eyeliner or Maybelline's Kohl Eye Pencil, but any regular eyeliner pencil or gel eyeliner will do. On some spots like around my eyes, and lips, you want to use a gel eyeliner because the pencil will pull at the skin, not giving you a nice clean line.  For the inside of the eyes (starting from the outer corner) I used: Black from MAC's Bleuluxe palette, then Ruby Kisses Tropical Paradise, and my favorite eyeshadow, Maybelline's Color Tattoo Pure Pigment in Never Fade Jade. Color Tattoo is one PIGMENTED eyeshadow for about $5 at any of your local drugstores and a little goes a LONG way! :)  Afterwards, blend baby blend! I used the same color palette on my forehead and chin. The outline under my cheeks, I just blended together the Ruby Kisses and the Mac black to achieve that color. Also, brushes kind of matter for this, well, two brushes really matter. I purchased two Elf brushes from the Dollar Tree (!!!), one was a Smudge brush and the other a Blending brush. You know what to do with the Blending brush, but the Smudge brush was great for applying the black on the outer corner of the eye and for accuracy in general. So if you don't have those two brushes, now you know where to get them CHEAP!  And that's it! Cheers!"

brownbeauty,32cogy,bug-bear,2,Tue Apr 14 01:02:27 2015 UTC,"I love MAC paint pots for this purpose. Because you're going to be covering the base with shadow, it doesn't usually matter what the colour of it is. This being said, however, if you're going to place it from lid to brow bone, I think the Groundwork shade would work well with your skin tone. I have oily lids, and when I wear them without a primer underneath I get minimal creasing after 12 hours of wear. I choose to use a primer though, because then my makeup doesn't budge at all, but you don't have to do that if you don't feel you need that extra step."

brownbeauty,32avbm,iamerica2109,2,Sun Apr 12 03:58:11 2015 UTC,The Naked 2 is my go to. I have both the Naked (original) and the Naked 2. I find myself reaching for the Naked 2 way more for both casual and going out looks. The Naked (original) I like better for darker looks as the colors are darker. I am also looking to complete the set by getting the 3 so I can stop using my friend's. The 3 to me has more pretty pinks than the other two that I really like. Hope this helps!  EDIT: Final assessment if you're looking for something for everyday I'd go with the naked 2. but if you want something a little more glamorous i'd go with the 3. Either way I'm a huge 'Naked' line fan.  Im also NC 42. My undertones are  yellow/olive/beige  (from what i've been told at sephora)

I have Naked 2, and my biggest complaint is that the colors either don't show up on my skin, and they don't look very...distinctive? I'm not saying don't get it, but swatch it on your skin if you can and make sure you're satisfied. It may take a lot of building up to get the color payoff that you want. Naked 1 could just be better than 2 so YMMV.    Edit: I'm NC45, warm golden undertones."
brownbeauty,32avbm,SivajiTheBoss,4,Sun Apr 12 04:50:19 2015 UTC,"Yesssss Naked palettes although look so pretty in the box, are not very pigmented.. The base colors that they are made if blend in almost completely on my NC44 skintone.. You need a light primer base color for it to show up.  I would recommend the Stila eyes are the Window palette in Soul & Mind. Also the Bobbi Brown Nude on Nude palette. And the lorac Unzipped."

brownbeauty,327qhp,pokeiman,2,Sat Apr 11 08:47:04 2015 UTC,"Wow that women's skin is so glow and fresh that's gorgeous.  To get something similar here is what I would do.  Face: I would start with a nice moisturizer what for it to mostly absorb, and then a primer that you like. For me my trick to super glowy healthy looking skin is the Wayne Goss method. So, using a powder that has a radiant finish, I really love Smashbox Halo powder in dark or NYX radiance finishing powder in Sunkissed, apply the powder before your foundation and after your primer. Using a damp sponge, I use the knock off beauty blender from target, apply your foundation by dabbing and lightly pressing the foundation into your skin. If needed add a light concealer under eyes or blemishes after foundation, and be sure to blend blend blend. Then using a coral blush lightly apply ot to the apple's of your cheeks and blend it back. For this look I would use a setting spray over powder to set the foundation to keep you looking fresh, and not powdery and matte.  Brows: I would start with a spoolie and comb out my brows. Then using a brow powder fill in the areas of your brows that need help. I would then use a flat brush to clean up the edges. If you want the messy look she has go back with the spoolie and brush your hairs until you get the desired effect. Use a light hand with that because you don't want to remove rhe product you judt added.  Eyes: I would go in with a highlight on the middle of your lid amd blend it until it looks more natural. Then add your favorite Mascara.   Lips: Depending on how pigmented your lips are I would go in with a pinky lip stain, and after it dries add chapstick.   Don't know if that's what you were looking for, it is just what I would do. Hope it helps."

For the people of color on this site this can make interpreting situations pretty laborsome. Personally I always try to  assume people mean the best even when they don't handle a situation on here in the best way.

What I mean is that there's no real criticism to be gained from posting on there because all the members of the sub will gawk over how foreign you are or how beautiful your dark skin looks. Furthermore, there is limited discussion about products for people darker than NC30 and very little input given when questions are asked. I try to contribute as much as I can for women with darker skin by tagging my posts with my mac number so when others search for products for their skintone, they'll find them. Frankly, MUA is quite useless for people with darker skin which is a shame because I've learned SO MUCH about light skin but very little about my own skintone and darker.

Personally, I agree about the trans posters.  Most of the comment section would be OMG you're SO BRAVE with barely any discussion on if she'd done a good job.  God forbid anyone post any actual CC - for any op.  Even if the op didn't mind, and no matter how carefully worded to avoid giving offense, there'd be a slew of others to jump all over anyone who tried to say anything but basically OMG YOURE SO PRETTY.   I thought it was really sad that the mods had to make it a sub rule to expect cc if you post.  I unsubbed.  I don't have the time or energy for the drama, and I've gotten more into indies and hangout on r/IMAM or here anyway.

Looking at SRD posts that come from MUA and seeing some pm the mods get is horrendous. I think some users are just bringing the whole sub down."
brownbeauty,3268la,LaFemmeFatale24,16,Sat Apr 11 19:05:55 2015 UTC,"It's okay. It's where I started out, but I'm about an NC40 and peoples' advice for some things (""perfect nudes"" and such) just isn't very useful. I don't hold it against them, I don't think anyone is trying to be offensive but a lot of people don't know how to deal with things that may be racial. Also, I find that this sub is pretty good about giving people a general idea of what their skin color is, but a lot of posters in MUA who may or may not be a similar color to me don't even think to say what their foundation shade is near. It can be hard to tell if someone is a similar shade to you when the lighting is iffy and stuff. I think of myself a being medium to medium deep (depending on sun exposure), but the gap feels wider on MUA sometimes.   Also I really hate when people say "" this is universally flattering"" on anything nude or light colored. Like no. Just no."
brownbeauty,3268la,iamerica2109,7,Sat Apr 11 05:25:14 2015 UTC,"I definitely feel like there is a huge gap on MUA. In the past on Text Tuesday I would start a darker complexion thread, and almost every time it would get derailed. It is like they know it's there, but choose to keep it that way. I have gotten some solid reccomendations and tips here which makes me so grateful this sub exists."

brownbeauty,3268la,sunnyk879,24,Sun Apr 12 00:28:39 2015 UTC,"I wonder how many cosmetics companies have considered that somebody like Lupita Nyong'o--y'know, THE fashion woman of the moment--would never be able to use their cosmetics even if she wanted to.  I wish more gorgeous lady celebrities--both dark and pale--would say something like ""gosh I sure would love to wear [X] but there is nothing dark enough for me/my friends to wear!""  If Oprah was still doing her show it would be so awesome for her to go through a CVS or Walgreens and go ""NOPE"" ""NOPE"" ""NOPE"" as she tossed Revlon, Maybelline, L'Oreal, etc on the floor while trying to find something to match her skintone.  When a lot of white people think about shade matching they think ""gosh this iteration of 'pale' is slightly too yellow for my skin"" not ""welp I guess I just need whole-body vitiligo to make this work"".  Anyway I think a lot of the flailing and confusion you see in these types of threads is the minds of white people being blown followed by groping attempts to reconcile ""but racism is over"" with the bare facts laid out on the shelves of drugstores and makeup counters everywhere. White privilege is never having to think about what shit is like outside of being white, ever."
brownbeauty,325ipf,iamerica2109,3,Fri Apr 10 19:23:08 2015 UTC,"All the things I do to make my skin lighter/more evenly pigmented:   Wear sunscreen. I use Clarins but I've heard good things about Neutrogena sheer touch. Apply hydroquinone. You can get 2% over the counter - and make sure to wear sunscreen while using it! This will mostly work for dark spots though, and less so for wider areas of darkness. Chemically exfoliate. Basically, find an alpha/beta hydroxy acid containing product and use it as often as your skin will permit (if you see peeling and redness, it's too often). I do it every night but I also have whatever the opposite of sensitive skin is."

I recently used the Philosophy microdelivery peel, it's a Vitamin C peel, on my face and the results were drastic. I want to say it lightened the scar about 60% with one use. It's pricey, but Sephora is always giving it as a sample which is how I got mine. Also sunscreen whenever going outdoors, even cloudy days."

What I can say, is that you're definitely going to want to invest in an SPF. Right now I use Purpose brand moisturizer with SPF 15 and it doesn't leave a white cast but I'm planning on bumping up to at least SPF 30 to get better protection."

The shiseido is really great at mattifying if you want that effect and the biore is just an all around good sunscreen.  Vitamin C serum is a good place to start. I can recommend OST C20 serum, it's a korean brand but you can purchase it on amazon. I also recommend garden of wisdom's majik C serum. You can also look into chemical peels like the VI peel at your derm, they can greatly help to even out your skin as well. If you're ok with trying chemical peels at home then I can recommend MUAC, specifically their mandelic, salicylic and glycolic peels."

I think you could try adding a darker brow color to the tail end and bottom of your brow. The tone you have now is light but it's also stopping them from overwhelming your face."
brownbeauty,31uz8a,beautylit,1 point,Wed Apr 8 11:40:20 2015 UTC,"Your lipstick is lovely. The shape and color are very flattering!  As for CC, I think a cooler, darker brown for your brows would suit you better. I would also extend the ""tails"" of your brows a little bit at the ends.   I have similar skin and hair color, so for a ""tester"" shade, I would recommend checking out the brown definer shade in the Wet N Wild comfort zone palette and suggest applying it with an angled brush for nice crisp lines."

My cc on the eye makeup would be to try adding a black line on the waterline or add a little mascara underneath just to add definition to the bottom. Also, it could be the lighting but your blush looks a little patchy try going over the edges with your setting powder. I love the matte nude lip too, Stay beautiful!"

I have found that Philosophy's Miracle Worker Eye Cream has been the most effective that I have used to date. I feel like I can ALMOST go out without concealer on which is HUGE to me. It has definitely minimized the dark circles and helped with under eye wrinkles/lines. I also bounce back and fourth between Lancome's Long Lasting Undereye Concealer and L'Oreal's True Match Concealer crayon. Since using the eye cream (about a month) I find I don'd need as much concealer these days. The eye cream is expensive, but definitely worth it."

I get that both sides deal with issues, like a lot of the comments said people will pick on anything, but the trying to relate part bothered me because the racist undercurrent of the teasing isn't the same for them.  Whatever though. As long as OP hears positive messages, I'm happy."
brownbeauty,31f819,blastedastronaut,9,Sun Apr 5 02:17:49 2015 UTC,"This is true. I am as fair as they come and people occasionally call me a ghost, make fun of my SPF 50 on a sunny winter day or mention my white tights (cough those are my bare legs), but this in no way equates to the bullying and racism I see happening to those with really dark skin. Hell, finding foundation to match clients with dark skin is ten times harder than matching my particular shade of Casper. When racism is corporate, there is a real issue.  Women everywhere: You are beautiful and I will back you up every day of the week."

brownbeauty,31fu5j,c3bysparrow,1 point,Sat Apr 4 18:06:08 2015 UTC,"Depending on your lip color and skintone, Rimmel Provocalips in Kiss Fatal (plum) or Heartbreaker (brownish red) should work for you. I'm an NC45 and both of these last forever on me and look great as a ""nude"" lip color. My lips are pigmented brownish plum/dark taupe naturally, so both of these colors read as neutral on my lips. If you're lighter than me, try the shade Make Your Move (pinkish brown).   A tip for the Provocalips: apply a very thin layer of the colored end, don't let your lips touch for a min or so while it dries, once it feels dry and sort of sticky you can apply the balm end. The balm stuff smells very perfumey in a bad way but it dissipates a little. If you want to reapply or touch up, be careful not to apply too much. It can get too thick and crack/peel right off."

brownbeauty,31960u,nerdygirl153,27,Fri Apr 3 00:09:13 2015 UTC,"You can absolutely pull this off!  Here are some key things about this kind of look:    Strong brow Poppin' lashes top and bottom --think doll lashes Rounded cheek color Rounded/Cupid's bow mouth with darker lip color.    Check out Josephine Baker as an excellent example. Of pretty much everything, honestly, but definitely of a Black woman contemporary example of the look.   If you look at photos of fashions from the time you'll see those same elements. Here's another example. And here's another one of Clara Bow. Doll lashes, smoky eye, sharp brow, round cheek, pouty mouth.  One thing many of us brown gals have going on is really nice, round lips. Those can really drive this whole look to a new level, so emphasize them. The lip and the lash are focal points for this. The cheek should be fresh and dewy and natural looking, so don't go too bright on the color, but add something with a touch of warm gold shimmer.   A trick you can use on the eye area is to line your inner waterline with a highlighter shade, rather than something dark. Go two or three shades lighter than your skin tone, or something halfway between your skin tone and the whites of your eyes. That will make your peepers pop, and create contrast with the lashes and eye shadow."

brownbeauty,30z8ei,thrownawayagainnow,17,Tue Mar 31 22:06:22 2015 UTC,"I hope I'm not out of place here, as I'm about an NC30 and I don't want to speak in a space that is not meant for me. However, it kills me to know that such a young lady is having such trouble over her skin tone and I'd love to help, if possible, even if its minimal.  I think your idea of showing her celebrities is a fantastic way to help her realize that beauty comes in every shade. I used to have troubles with my body shape in the late 90s/early 2000s before J Lo, Shakira, etc. came out to really embrace the hourglass figure, which was so different from 90s 'heroin chic' look. It sounds so silly, but Sir Mixalot's Baby Got Back song even helped. It really helped me embrace my figure and learn rock it. And given that your cousin has cited the beautiful Lupita Nyong'o,  I think your influence might be making more of an impact than you realize.   My sister is the same age. She was watching Keeping Up with the Kardashians and suddenly was worried about cellulite! At 12! My mom barred her from watching the show after that, but once that thought is in there, it's hard to forget since they are at such an impressionable age. I understand your concern, and I just want you to know that it's really fantastic that you're putting so much effort into trying to help your cousin. You are a great inspiration to her and it's already been proven that she listens to you and remembers your words. Kudos for being such an awesome, caring cousin.  I would definitely suggest speaking to your family about it - they simply might not understand the effect it's having on her. You could also spin their words around when speaking to your cousin about other family members - perhaps imply that they are only giving her a hard time because they are envious of her glorious skin tone because it makes her stick out in an otherwise pale-obsessed culture. Her skin tone sets her apart from others in that it makes her unique, it makes her memorable to others in positive ways, and soon inshallah she will realize that she is beautiful.   I'm sorry if I wasn't much help or if I'm out of place for speaking on such matters, but I am really moved by your efforts to help your cousin. As one who, as I said, has a 12 year old sister, I understand how difficult it can be to help them navigate the path toward self love."
brownbeauty,30z8ei,crayolasand,6,Wed Apr 1 00:29:12 2015 UTC,"Aw thanks, (I'm really not a great cousin though), I don't have any siblings and always wanted them, and she's kind of like a little sister to me.  Yeah, I've tried speaking to my family, but only my mum (who has lived in the UK for the past 15 years and is now culturally pretty much British - though she'll deny it!) really gets it - no one takes me seriously if I mention it. Are there any people/celebrities in particular or websites you think I could show her? Maybe I should show her some posts from this sub? (Also, it's just occurred to me that I should totally introduce her to The Legend of Korra...)  Thanks for the reply!  Edit: I hope your little sister learns to love herself as well (if she hasn't already)."
brownbeauty,30z8ei,crayolasand,1 point,Wed Apr 1 03:50:46 2015 UTC,"You are being modest! You're being not only a great cousin but a great mentor. The Legend of Korra is a great idea, and even in the first Avatar series Katara could also be a bamf example to show off darker toned beauties. Off the top of my head, Frieda Pinto might be another example - especially since she, too, is from a country that will generally celebrate a lighter skin tone, yet she is adored globally and is an absolutely beautiful woman imho. You could also show her the 'Dark Is Beautiful' campaign and Nandita Das, who is a big part of it.  Another idea is to explain that the grass always seems greener on the other side. There are people with light skin who worship the sun to get darker, then in contrast there are skin whitening creams for those with darker tones to get lighter. You could even compare it to hair - those who have it curly want it straight, those who have it straight want it curly; I know that seems simplistic given the fact that the obsession with lighter skin has a lot of serious implications, but for a young girl it might help drive the point home?   And thank you for your kind wishes toward my own sister! I genuinely hope that your cousin will come to embrace her beauty, not only her skin tone but everything else. Pre-teen and teen years aren't easy and there will always be another hurdle, but I'm sure she will know that you are always there to help her."
brownbeauty,30z8ei,l0l0lol0l0l,6,Thu Apr 2 03:05:54 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I remember kind of feeling the same way when I was really young (like 7/8) and wanting to have blonde hair and to look like the white women in L'Oreal hair ads (random, I know). I'm 24 now and only in the last two years have I really appreciated being a person of colour (NC42ish) instead of disliking my heritage/colouring, and I haven't even received overt comments from other people like your cousin has, so I can only imagine how much it upsets her.  I think it would be great if you could talk to the members of your family that tease her, and try to explain that it makes her feel self-conscious and that they should make an effort to stop. They may only see their comments as jokes, but they just perpetuate underlying currents of racism that assert that whiteness is best. If you do want to speak to them about it, I honestly would avoid saying the word 'racist' or anything like it, as it may make them feel like you are attacking them. I think it would be most effective just to describe how upset it makes her personally and to explain that when kids hear these ideas repeatedly, it really sticks with them and informs their views of themselves and others.  I think showing her pictures of well know women of colour is a really good idea, and it might be good to show her pictures of women who are well known in her region who have darker skin like hers (if there are any). Also, I would try not to focus on conventional ideas of beauty/beautiful women, as it might give her other hangs up maybe, but focus on women who are confident with who they are. And, please dissuade her from using skin lightening products if she ever wants to as they can be so harmful!  It sucks so much that she feels this way when she's so young, but, like /u/crayolasand said, it's really awesome that you're trying to make her feel better about herself! :)"

But I'm glad that this community is open to discussing things other than strictly products. Skin tone is something related to beauty that so many of us deal with.      I hope your cousin realizes that how beautiful she is is independent of her skin colour. And that you continue to interject when family members make ignorant comments.
brownbeauty,30z8ei,LilKingTrashMouf,7,Thu Apr 2 18:45:38 2015 UTC,"The advice here so far is good. I would also say to encourage and praise her for things that are not focused on looks. Tell her how funny, kind, intelligent she is. Let her know that she has so many more good qualities."

I don't know if it would help, but you could tell her that although people don't appreciate how she looks in her area, around the world, she is considered to have a beautiful skin color. Additionally, perhaps mention that if people tease her for her skin, it is nothing to do with her, but rather their own incorrect attitudes."
brownbeauty,30z8ei,jingabobo,3,Fri May 1 02:24:11 2015 UTC,"Hi, I'm a darker Asian girl and it took a very long time to accept my skin tone. Growing up, I absolutely hated my skin, my family is much paler than me and everyone made fun of me for it. When I got to high school, other asians would call me half black or half Mexican because my dark skin tone apparently invalidates me being Asian. They would say ""You're so dark!!!"" As if it was a bad thing, and the amount of bully I got from so called friends ingrained the idea that white skin = beauty in my head. It got to the point where I was horribly depressed. For about all of high school, including summers, I always wore long pants and long sleeves to hide myself from the sun and obsessively wore sun screen. I wouldn't go outside and I almost committed to skin bleaching in Asia.    What helped me was college, but I'm sure it can apply to your cousin. The people in my dorm told me they would kill for a tan like mine and that my skin was beautiful. I think the first step would be to dissociate the idea that dark/brown skin is ugly/not valued in beauty standards. I think it's great that you're showing her pictures of celebs that have her skin tone. There are so many beautiful women of all sizes, shapes, and shades! I think another important step would be to reassure that her skin tone is gorgeous! Another further step might be to tell your family how she feels so they can be more conscious about what they're saying around her.   It's amazing that you're helping her now, especially during that age of transition. Many ideas of beauty were put into my head around that time. Sorry for the long post, it's just something I've struggled with for so long and to hear another young girl, once like myself, is going through the same thing... Breaks my hurt."
brownbeauty,30z8ei,asuka_is_my_co-pilot,3,Wed Apr 15 22:16:03 2015 UTC,"I had the same problem with my 12 year old sister actually! She's only a shade darker than me but both of us are quite a bit darker than our mother. She became insecure about it after we visited Bangladesh a few years ago.   What I do is compliment her very often in a casual way. I try to make her think that her being pretty is just an unimportant fact of life and that since she has that area covered, she can worry about other things. I call her a cutie pie all the time and I give her maybe 3-4 compliments a week on her appearance.   Of course, compliment her on other things as well, but at this age girls can get so insecure that I don't think it hurts to always let them know that you think they're pretty. If she hears it from you all the time, it will build her confidence when she's with other people even if she doesn't believe you 100%. And if she brings up her own skin tone, let her know that you think she's being ridiculous and tell her that it's normal for girls her age to be insecure about dumb things.   You can also continue complimenting other dark girls when you're around her because she might be comparing herself to them and obviously it would help if she thinks that you don't care about their skin tones either. That story about Lupita is really cute :)  Also, you can try to make your own confidence an example to her. My mom is very secure in how she looks and while I was growing up she always gave off the air that it didn't matter what other people thought about her appearance. I think that helped me a lot when I was in middle school and it helps my sister a lot now.   I've actually been really impressed with my sister recently because she doesn't worry at all about her typical brown girl hairiness even though her friends point it out to her. And I don't think she worries about her skin at all anymore. The good thing about being insecure at such a young age is that it's pretty easy to change their minds about it and give them a good foundation for being confident later in life."
brownbeauty,30z8ei,animousity692,2,Wed Apr 1 04:37:46 2015 UTC,"This is such a sad state of affairs in Asia, I grew up there and know very well what you mentioned.   There are so many horrible ads that show darker girls being rejected from getting jobs, promotions and even being rejected for marriage!! It infuriates me to see that such crap is allowed to air!!   The first question people ask of prospective brides to their parents is the color of their skin, goes to show what is cultivated as the worth of a person.   Just look at the line-up of Bollowood & South Indian Cinema Actor/actresses.. Barely any of them are dark. They make it to the top partly because they are fair.   In the industry that the country is so obsessed with, there is no representation for the common appearance of the masses!!(Bar a select few)  So kids grow up idolizing people that do not look like themselves and mistakenly find fault in their own appearance for not matching the images on screen. It is sadly part of human nature & only positive reinforcements contrary to this belief can counter this.  It will take several decades to eradicate such terrible viewpoints & attitudes. In the meanwhile, we must foster all our little sisters & brothers with a sense of positive self worth that is focused on their personality and to embrace their beautiful color, to realize that yes brown is beautiful, black is beautiful.  Positive role models that share your heritage will help boost their confidence.  Aung Suu Kyi, Lupita, Serena & Venus(NOT Asian But great role models!!), Abdul Kalam, AR Rehman, Kalpana Chowdhary, Amar Bose(creator the THE Bose speakers!!), MIA are just some of the inspiring people I can think of from the South Asian region off the bat.

Though, a postal worker didn't tell me till I'd shipped my envelope (assjerkface) posting a box is cheaper in the long run to the US than an envelope.  Still it's like ¬£13 for up to a kilo. Factor in what you're spending in the first place it can be pricey. Also, we can only receive ¬£36 worth of gift item (unless you fudge the customs form) without getting taxed. And if they send it special delivery we have to pay Parcelforce for the pleasure.  I hate Royal Mail."
brownbeauty,30xdub,betafrogg,2,Mon Apr 13 12:10:50 2015 UTC,"I like exchanges.  I've been sending people stuff/ exchanging stuff for years and I'm well aware of the costs involved and explaining to whoever is sending me stuff about UK import tax thresholds.   Tiered swop would help keep cost down for those who don't want to do a massive exchange (I myself usually go for the lowest option on reddit swaps which has so far been around ¬£16). So it could be a swop of one lipstick, or two eyeshadow singles for example- at drug store or indie prices the initial cost would be ~¬£5. For those who want more items/ more expensive items there can be higher tiers. Maybe add at the bottom (like a lot of online shops that ship internationally) that receivers should check thier local import customs thresholds to help them decide on a tier and inform thier swop partners.  I think another factor that pushes up the cost and weight is the unspoken keeping up with the jonses obligation for sending extras (like sweets) in the makeup subs on reddit. Doing a 'pure' swop would illuminate that.  What I really enjoy about exchanges is interacting with people over a common interest- finding out about someone and trying to figure out what they would enjoy from what they've told me, or what thing they might never have bought for themselves but I think would work well. And the same for me I get things I've never considered but actually turn out really well, or things I've coveted from afar.   Ultimately I could just buy these things myself, and whilst shopping for myself is fun and all its not the same.   /r/MUAEurope recently started up and now has a spreadsheet with various brands based in various European countries which just makes me thirst for an exchange because there are so many gems that never get a platform in the US centric main beauty subs. I would happily make a shared spreadsheet for here too, but with a focus on brands that actually cater for wider ranges in undertone and skin colour for medium and dark skins. I digress, this probably feeds more into how to help the sub be active or something.   An exchange with other brown beauties (which I am admittedly on the paler spectrum right now with winter skin) would mean interacting with people who get what it's like to spend years (it's taken me 18 years of trying off and on again to find a foundation (well BB cream) that's close enough to my actual colour for me to be happy with and even now it's not yellow enough) and money (¬£29 for 40ml). And even not find these things yet. It would also be with people who wouldn't pressure I'm pale with pink undertones when choosing lip colours or nudes. I want to do it because I'd love to try brands or things I've never heard of chosen by people who I get to have a conversation with and learn about and do the same for them. It would also be a community event for people to join in with that doesn't require face pics.  TL;DR Exchanges are as expensive/  weighty as you make them. Start tiers low. It's also about interacting with others in the sub.   Edit: wow that was longer than I thought it would be. I'm gonna go get my morning coffee now XD"

brownbeauty,30x7a1,chiffonandheels,2,Tue Mar 31 20:29:59 2015 UTC,Sleek started out as a brand targeted specifically at black women. They've since decided to cater for a wider (lighter) range of skin tones. It doesn't surprise me you say the contour kits run a bit dark.

brownbeauty,30j2up,itsadooozy,1 point,Sun Mar 29 20:54:59 2015 UTC,"I do like her channel a lot as well. She has been on YT for a while and has grown into a lovely MUA! She does a lot of lip swatches which is so useful when shopping for lipsticks.  The one thing I suspect is that her foundation/concealing is too light for her skin tone and looks ok in the vids because she uses ring lights or some other strong lighting for her videos. If she wore that out in natural sunlight it would not look very natural on her, anyways that's just my speculation as a viewer and should not take away any credit from her channel content or skills. :)"

brownbeauty,30iqn2,journalistwannabe,3,Fri Mar 27 18:45:18 2015 UTC,"I can barely see the color on you, honestly. Maybe try using something white in your pictures to get a more accurate color, or a different spot to take pictures. Also, if you want to go bolder with color, it's about not clashing rather than matching. Cool colors make warmer tones pop so you can try cool color eyeshadows like blue and green."
brownbeauty,30iqn2,faith_trustpixiedust,1 point,Mon Mar 30 12:25:58 2015 UTC,"I quite like what you've done here~ a few constructive comments:  I don't know how your brows grow naturally, but if they're quite thick up front and significantly skinner at the tail (as is in the picture) a good way to balance the brow is adding a bit of color as the brow gets skinner. I've done a quick mockup here If this is something you're going for, it definitely helps enhance the fullness of the middle part, which is a good way to really create a seamless brow.  Your face is so totally flawless though, let's point that out for real. The outfit is adorable and your hair is so great. :D"

Paired with a dark brown through the crease, it looks quite nice."
brownbeauty,30jan3,chiffonandheels,1 point,Fri Mar 27 22:02:53 2015 UTC,That's actually honestly a great idea! I have a lighter powder that I set my highlight with and that might make my lid appear a lighter brown. Thank you!

I did a few swatches of the matte brown shadows in my collection and I think the very top one here might be what you're looking for? It is high end though. It's MUFE Shadow #98 (not an artist shadow, it's from their normal shadow range). The rest of the shadows are Lorac Pro - Sable, Lorac Pro - Espresso, Kat Von D Monarch Palette - Shadowbox. Also worth it to note that the MUFE one was the only one I only had to swipe once to get that pigmentation!"

brownbeauty,30iz2u,saucyminxy,10,Fri Mar 27 19:49:34 2015 UTC,"Ashy around where? The mouth and eyes? All over ashiness?   If it's all over, then you probably have the wrong undertone for your foundation. If it's around your eyes/mouth where you have darkness or hyperpigmentation, your best bet is color correction."
brownbeauty,30iz2u,chiffonandheels,3,Fri Mar 27 20:55:20 2015 UTC,"I agree that usually if a foundation looks ashy, it's the wrong color. What foundation is it? And what others have you tried?"
brownbeauty,30iz2u,Theokeydoke,1 point,Fri Mar 27 22:01:12 2015 UTC,It's Clinique. I used to do Prescriptives custom blend and have been kinda at a loss after they shut that line down
brownbeauty,30iz2u,chiffonandheels,3,Tue Mar 31 18:53:59 2015 UTC,Ashy all over. I've been mixing Clinique foundations. I have a strong yellow undertone... or so I thought.  Maybe that's my problem.
brownbeauty,30iz2u,faith_trustpixiedust,1 point,Sat Mar 28 09:34:01 2015 UTC,"If you have a strong yellow undertone, are you using a yellow toned foundation? If your foundation is pink, it will create ashiness. If it's even a neutral undertone it may create ashiness. Mixing foundations won't help with undertone if they're the wrong undertone, unfortunately."
brownbeauty,30iz2u,faith_trustpixiedust,1 point,Sat Mar 28 20:11:47 2015 UTC,"I am using a yellow-toned foundation, but maybe it's not yellow enough. Just saw on here somewhere that people were adding turmeric to their foundation to give even more of a yellow tone. Guess I'll have to do some experimenting. Thanks everyone!"
brownbeauty,30iz2u,faith_trustpixiedust,2,Sat Mar 28 22:06:43 2015 UTC,"Just get a new foundation. It's easier to use one for your right shade than to mix a bunch. If you're having trouble finding your shade, you should try www.blackupcosmetics.com . I had trouble finding my shade too. I tried their website questionnaire which was actually one shade away from the foundation I feel is the best fit. They send you samples with free shipping. It's worth a shot if all other options were exhausted."

brownbeauty,30f0bs,RhombusBlue,4,Thu Mar 26 20:56:57 2015 UTC,"Have you tried just using a MLBB (ugh I hate this term) liner on your lips after a layer of foundation across your lips? You might even try setting the foundation with a layer of powder and then line them-- I think a liner that's a shade or two darker than your lip color will make them appear smaller if that's what you're going for!    As for the moisture, I have pretty cracked lips as well, and the best thing I can do to prevent cracking is actually like, sucking on my lips really hard before I apply lipstick so they're a bit inflamed-- the creasing is less prominent and I can get every nook and cranny and the lip color doesn't crack as my lips get smaller. Dunno if this is will help since you list size as an issue and making your lips more swollen might be the opposite of what you want, but try it~"
brownbeauty,30f0bs,chiffonandheels,1 point,Thu Mar 26 22:27:01 2015 UTC,I haven't tried MLBB...anything special about it?
brownbeauty,30f0bs,foreverfriend_zoned,2,Sun Mar 29 19:01:07 2015 UTC,An mlbb stands for my lips but better. Basically a nude neutral color that matches closely to your natural lip color.
brownbeauty,30f0bs,LaFemmeFatale24,1 point,Wed Apr 1 00:39:35 2015 UTC,Ha...I thought a brand had named themselves that.

Maybe it's confirmation bias, but I always find that drugstore shades tend to follow along more NC than NW.  Sleek has a BB/CC cream that I swatched and liked, but ultimately didn't buy. I know high end is expensive l, but I've just sucked it up, bought high end because I've been burned too many times with drugstore brands. In the UK you can't return if you open and don't like it.  I'm also really interested in this topic, hopefully someone has found something."
brownbeauty,300r5y,stufstuf,3,Mon Mar 23 17:42:46 2015 UTC,"That's been the worst thing about shades for me, we have a few brands here in the States that cater to brown skin (Milani, Black Radiance, the Queen colleciton from Covergirl, etc.), but whenever I swatch them on, they feel too heavy for my skin. I work in an office, so I don't have to worry about sweating, but I don't want to touch my face, and then get makeup smudges on paperwork, haha.   If I find something that's in the UK as well as the States, and it works, i'll let you know!"
brownbeauty,300r5y,stufstuf,2,Mon Mar 23 18:05:24 2015 UTC,"YES! This is my one pet peeve with makeup for our shade, I find it really hard to find light makeup. It's always just heavy, full coverage makeup and it makes me sad."

I mean, I understand if you've got hyper-pigmentation, or acne scars, or other tiny facial marks that you'd want to cover up, but honestly, if you're younger, and active, you might not want something so heavy! I don't even wear heavy makeup when I go out at night because I feel like i'm wearing a mask. Shame that I can't even find a nice tinted moisturizer without paying $30 or more...."

brownbeauty,3007wx,motor_mouth,4,Mon Mar 23 12:39:15 2015 UTC,"I'm NW45, so this might help you out.   The best pinks for me have always been Smashbox's ""Cognac"", and NARS' ""Rikugien"". I also like to use Smashbox's ""Endless"" as a nice, simple gloss when I want something nude/pink on my lips when I'm running errands. If you're looking for a bright pink, MAC's ""Viva Glam Miley Cyrus"" has looked GREAT on me, it's just bright enough where it stands out, but I don't look like a clown. Hope that helps!"

You look shiny in those photos. And maybe try looking into more pigmented products? I would have loved to see the colors show more."
brownbeauty,2zop6v,faith_trustpixiedust,1 point,Mon Mar 23 03:56:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, definitely didn't notice the foundation color thing until the photos. Oops.   I do prefer being dewy over being matte, though. Some of these are deliberately over the top frosty (the fox thing and the ice thing). Sorry if I come off rude, I'm not trying to be, but none of these are actually daily wear looks. The first one was for a competition for pastel makeup, and that's about as close to pastel as I could get without it being shades of off-white."
brownbeauty,2zop6v,faith_trustpixiedust,5,Mon Mar 23 05:41:49 2015 UTC,"No no I get being dewy, but to me it looks sweaty, not dewy. You can make up for dewiness by with illuminators.. I think, but those pictures don't look dewy. Maybe it's because the shade isn't perfect. I would recommend www.blackupcosmetics.com . I know you're not black, but the have an extremely wide range of foundations, from light yellow to deep ebony. I'm suggesting them because they have a questionare to help you find your shade, and you can order samples for your shade, abd they will ship for free. They also have an international website at www.blackup.com . That's where I got my foundation after failing to find the right shade for years.   Btw, you weren't being rude :)"

brownbeauty,2zlzcg,Dreadfulgam,8,Thu Mar 19 18:17:53 2015 UTC,"Really like the color choices! I'd work on blending out your blush (can see a harsh line right now on your cheek). Also, try filling in your brows with short strokes so the effect is a bit more feathery and natural. Right now, they look a little too uniform and dark for your face, they're overpowering your other features. I'd start by making short strokes in the middle of the brow, adding a tiny bit near the front and a tiny bit near the tails."
brownbeauty,2zlzcg,glaceauglaceau,3,Thu Mar 19 18:45:18 2015 UTC,Thank you Do you think I should start using a bronzer to warm up that area instead of just blush?
brownbeauty,2zlzcg,glaceauglaceau,6,Thu Mar 19 19:07:08 2015 UTC,"Actually, what I'd do is use three products: a blush, a contour powder (which could be a bronzer, just a matte, neutral toned or even slightly cool toned one), and a highlight. Apply the bronzer in the hollow of your cheek, don't go too far down the cheek towards your mouth. Apply a blush right above it and blend with the bronzer a bit. Then apply highlighter very sparingly, on the tops of the cheekbones, pretty close to your eye.  Here is a mockup of what I mean!"
brownbeauty,2zlzcg,Hummus_Hole,6,Thu Mar 19 19:28:17 2015 UTC,I think your face looks beautiful but as others have said use a lighter hand when doing your eyebrows and work on blending.
brownbeauty,2zlzcg,your-beast-of-burden,2,Thu Mar 19 20:50:14 2015 UTC,Thank you I'll try
brownbeauty,2zlzcg,beautylit,5,Thu Mar 19 22:01:34 2015 UTC,"The colors you chose are awesome. However, i agree with the other commenter that you just need to up your blending game a little bit. The contour/blush is a little too low on your cheeks and it just needs a little more blending. The highlight as well is a little heavy. I think it would look better if you moved it higher on your cheekbones to really accentuate that area.   The eyebrows are too dark and a little too heavily drawn on. Maybe try a lighter shade of brown, or use a powder instead of gel. You have a great face, no need to distract from it with overpowering brows."
brownbeauty,2zlzcg,AturOkem,5,Thu Mar 19 18:49:50 2015 UTC,Thank you I actually thought my blush was too high but I'll try putting it higher.. I really love dark eyebrows.. I think I might go back to powder brows it would be easier to make my brows a bit lighter
brownbeauty,2zlzcg,ethiobirds,3,Thu Mar 19 19:05:28 2015 UTC,"Yass to your glow and eyeshadow blending. Cc in your brows, brows are hard because of personal preference. Becauses of your skin tone I would try a more brown brow shade to keep the precise shape but soften the look"

brownbeauty,2z5mal,jikajika,3,Sun Mar 15 20:10:50 2015 UTC,"What's on my lips? My heart ;)  Here's how I did it.  -To conceal the natural color of my lips I used L.A. Girl Concealer, Cover Girl Foundation, & a Bronzer, but use whatever does the trick for you.  -I then used a flat brush to paint on the heart using MAC Retro Matte Riri Boy (and boy is this matte).  -I then outlined outer part of the heart with my Kiss High Precision Liquid Liner, of course, in ink black.  -Next, I used my smudge eye brush to apply the black shadow inbetween my lips and along the dark corners which I previously outlined. I used MAC The Monster's Bride Palette in Carbon (but any black eyeshadow will do). I then used my blending eye brush to blend it in so it does not have a harsh line.  -The highlight, you MUST use a liquid or gel liner to apply this final touch. Tried to use a pencil and it tried to turn my heart pink (argh)! I have no idea of the name of the product I used (it has zero labels), but I used a very skinny, and small, paint brush to apply the highlight.  *And to give credit, I got this idea from @depechegurl on Instagram. She's amazing :) *  Oh and the eyes, the Kiss Liquid Liner. ;)"

brownbeauty,2z1e06,penguinsocks,2,Sun Mar 15 07:32:36 2015 UTC,how do you like the hourglass foundation/how is the coverage?  I've been having such a hard time finding a foundation that matches my undertones :(  I like how the powder looks in the centre of your face but I feel like it is a bit too much on your chin?  It gives you a flawless look though :)  And I love the eyeliner!
brownbeauty,2z1e06,penguinsocks,1 point,Sat Mar 14 19:05:12 2015 UTC,"Hmm ok, I think I see what you mean (I can't tell very well). Maybe because I didn't use my concealer to highlight my chin like I did the tops of my cheek bones and under my eyebrows? I don't do the nose because it's weird looking. And thank you, it's the first time I've gotten winged liner right on the first try. Then I fucked up by trying to practice with my eyes open instead of closed and pulled tight (have always have loose eyeskin)  Since I apply the foundation in a sheer layer (because I like the ""no-makeup"" makeup look for my foundation) it's still good for covering the different tones of my face. However, I don't have things like hyper pigmentation or dark marks to cover, besides some on my cheek that were lessened by the foundation (so I mixed it with concealer to completely cover) so I believe the coverage is the low to medium. For full, you want the Immaculate Mattifying Foundation which is much much fuller, but be careful not to over apply.   I also will caution you that the shade I'm wearing is the DARKEST SHADE in the range. No joke. Also all the dark shades come in warm tones, not cool, so it's very limited for darker ladies. They have been adding new shades so some products, such as the concealer (I think to match the darkest shade in the foundations), so they may be expanding."
brownbeauty,2z1e06,penguinsocks,1 point,Sun Mar 15 07:31:28 2015 UTC,"thank you for such a detailed response! My skin leans towards a neutral undertone so darker foundations never seem to match my skin :( I'll definitely still give it a look though.  Perhaps a slightly lighter application of the powder would make the whole look a touch lighter? Sorry, wish I could be more helpful!"

brownbeauty,2z0258,bomkum,11,Sat Mar 14 07:51:16 2015 UTC,"I usually stick to a bronze or gold or maybe silvery eye look. Mostly neutral. Sometimes I'll incorporate a little bit of whatever color my dress is, but I'm always afraid of going overboard with colors. My mom, though. She'll be like ""Hmmm... My dress is blue. Where's the bluest eyeshadow in all the lands?"" And then sweep it across her eyelids with very minimal blending and calls it a look.

You cam wear s color that compliments the colors of your outfit. Pull up a color wheel and use the color the direct opposite of the main Color in your outfit, or pick the color to the right or left of the main color in your outfit. It's not about matching, it's about not clashing.   Also, you could just pair colors warm to cool. I have warm undertones, so I usually do a cool color eye shadow (green and blue are my fave) to make my skin and brown eyes pop more. I have a pic if you'd like to see"

brownbeauty,2z0258,glaceauglaceau,5,Sat Mar 14 16:31:29 2015 UTC,"I usually try and match to the beading/thread work, instead of the main colour of the outfit. That way, you can still be kinda matching to your outfit, without having to be neutral.   Last night, however, I wore a hot pink sari, the beading was silver, and I didn't feel like putting on silver eye shadow. So I  matched to the hot pink colour (using the electric palette & some fyrinnae shadows), and it turned out great! I added MAC Reflects pearl all over my eyes to tie in some element of silver/pearls, though."
brownbeauty,2z0258,plopple,3,Sat Mar 14 16:30:51 2015 UTC,"The standard choice of either one of Gold, brown, bronze, mauve, plum & peach smoked out with a bit of black are perfect for any desi outfit + our brown/olive/deep skintones. :)  I sometimes will add a tinge of the sari color on my lid but never full on matchy matchy. I match my bindi & bangles though.  One thing I've learnt is, if you are wearing a red/maroon/navy blue colored outfit, do not go with nude lips. Red or burgundy lipsticks look best!  If you are wearing green or lighter blue outfits, neutral lipsticks are more flattering.  For neutral colored outfits, a nice pink/Fuschia looks great."

Also the new Wet n Wild Fergie All Over Shimmer in Hollywood Boulevard is amazing as a highlighter. On the skin the golden color is similar to NARS Albatross, but it is more shimmery. You could also get the Rose Golden Goddess shade if you want something more peachy that can double as a blush, or the Rose Champagne Glow if you want a cooler toned pink toned highlight.   For lips, I like Wet n Wild Sugar Plum Fairy, Maybelline Color Elixir in Vision in Violet and the orange color, and the L'oreal Pro Matte Gloss in Rouge Envy and Tantalizing Tangerine. Also the new Cover girl Lip Lavas are amazing! Super crazy pigmented with interesting, bright colors. Look it's Lava is a must."

brownbeauty,2yq6nb,MintyLotus,1 point,Wed Mar 11 22:37:49 2015 UTC,I think it'll be better for everyday color correcting as well. The concealer in a jar is a bit too creamy for me!
brownbeauty,2yq6nb,motor_mouth,1 point,Wed Mar 11 22:45:41 2015 UTC,What is the peach supposed to correct? I use a peach corrector for my (purple) under eye circles but I'm not sure what I would need all over purple corrector for‚Ä¶?
brownbeauty,2yq6nb,motor_mouth,5,Thu Mar 12 13:01:30 2015 UTC,"Peach is for neutralizing blue/purple tones. Green for red tones. Purple is for yellow/sallow tones or allegedly really dark circles on darker skin. I haven't tried purple yet, I normally stick to peach/orange."
brownbeauty,2yq6nb,stufstuf,1 point,Thu Mar 12 13:12:53 2015 UTC,"Yes - I guess I'm kinda puzzled as to what would cause all-over blue/purple tones to appear on someone's face? Genuinely asking, sorry if the question is rude."

I think there are 5 shades and I wear the 3rd. I am a light Rihanna/beyonce color and can usually wear ""deep"" in most brands.  Anyways, the product is ok, not great."
brownbeauty,2yiaj1,stufstuf,3,Tue Mar 10 15:27:21 2015 UTC,Yes I am sometimes surprised by their color selection too. I feel they should have more range. I definitely want to add a CC cream to my cosmetic lineBLAC Minerals Cosmetics. I wonder if most use CC creams as a quick foundation product? something simple and easy but still offers some coverage
brownbeauty,2yiaj1,honeybuttery,4,Tue Mar 10 16:14:14 2015 UTC,"They do it because they can. It bothers me too, we can never seem to get in on any of the hype trends. I think that's why I went so deep into trying to find the perfect cushion foundation because it made me mad as hell that my skin colour wasn't even considered.  It's changing, slowly. The problem isn't just that brands are slow to make these products in these shades, but also that when they do retailers don't stock them. Even when they do we are hesitant to buy because we all have a story where we've been burned before.  There's so many layers to this."
brownbeauty,2yiaj1,beta_exe,2,Thu Mar 12 19:10:23 2015 UTC,"I have gotten so frustrated trying to find BB creams and CC creams in the past. I went through this very annoying cycle where I'd hear about one that someone really liked, I'd get amped up about the forumla, and then come to find that some don't even try to make a 'deep' shade at all! I'm all for bringing out a product geared towards WOC, especially since there are probably a lot of us who would be interested in a good CC cream."
brownbeauty,2yiaj1,iamerica2109,1 point,Wed Mar 11 03:09:03 2015 UTC,Smashbox has a really great CC cream that is amazing for WOC. Looks good worn by itself or underneath a foundation as a primer/corrector.

brownbeauty,2yepqb,berryshur,6,Mon Mar 9 16:59:25 2015 UTC,"I just got the Nars, and I feel like it's easy to get white cast if I use too heavy of a hand.

brownbeauty,2yepqb,honeybuttery,2,Mon Mar 9 04:14:45 2015 UTC,"Seconding the tarte powder, I use it to set every day and it never leaves a white cast. Bare minerals mineral veil is also good, they offer it in a translucent one or in a tinted to your skin tone shade"

brownbeauty,2yepqb,mycarebeardontcare,2,Mon Mar 9 12:26:05 2015 UTC,Have you tried using a makeup setting spray? Elf has a great one for $3. I found that has helped.

brownbeauty,2y50jw,Mayleyne,6,Fri Mar 6 14:50:07 2015 UTC,"It's never too late to get into the game, haha. If you don't feel the need to wear makeup, you don't have to! Don't feel pressured to wear makeup. Do it because you want to.  For me, these are the absolute basic necessities for a very light everyday look: eyelash curler, a waterproof mascara, under eye concealer, a tinted lip product, brow gel, face primer, tinted skin product (tinted moisturizer, BB cream, whatever), neutral shimmery eyeshadow, and powder. With just these, I can put together a five minute face that makes me look like me but fresh and awake.  Other products you might want to buy include foundation, blush, bronzer, highlighter, lipliner, eyeshadow, eyeshadow primer, color correctors, contouring products, eyeliner and brushes.  I find the single biggest things that change my appearance are keeping my brows shaped and using under eye concealer, because I have bushy brows and darkness under the eyes. For you it might be different. If you post a picture of your face, we could give you more recommendations with regards to specific products to try, easy looks you could learn, etc. There are a huge variety of products out there that work really beautifully on women of color even at the drugstore level, but it will be easiest to give you recommendations if we can see what you look like."

If you can help me out based on this pic you would be AMAZING XD   http://i.imgur.com/ovJI77f.jpg  I'm trying my best to sort myself out, by drinking more water etc. I used to rely on this range of tea tree facial cleansers but when I used it recently I got a rash =/ I also have skin picking disorder, I basically peel the dry skin off my lips pretty much all day. It's a rly bad habit I've had since I was a kid so I know I'll need some sorta moisturising lip balm or something..."
brownbeauty,2y50jw,Anne_of_Avonlea,7,Fri Mar 6 19:19:40 2015 UTC,"Ok, so I think you would look great with an easy everyday look. For a starter set, I'd buy:   eyelash curler brow product - NYX makes a good brow kit that comes with a wax and two shades of powder mascara. I like Maybelline and L'Oreal for drustore mascara brands. I prefer waterproof formulas because they hold a curl better. foundation. You might need to go to Sephora to get a color match. Ask for samples, they're free! If you have dry or oily skin, mention it to the person helping you and they'll find a formula that works for your skin type. color corrector for under the eyes. NYX makes a nice one, get the darkest color they offer. face primer. Rimmel and ELF make nice ones at the drugstore level. under eye concealer. Again, might need to get some samples at Sephora. Most people go one shade lighter than their skin tone for under eye concealer, I actually prefer to match my skintone. Pick up samples of one that matches your skintone and one that is a shade lighter and see which you prefer. black pencil eyeliner for tightlining lip color. The Wet n Wild Balm Stain in Lady and the Vamp or Truffle in Paradise would be lovely on you. Jordana also makes nice balm stains, as does Revlon. translucent setting powder. I like Rimmel Stay Matte. highlighter. You'd look fabulous with Hard Candy So Baked Bronzer in the Tiki color, or Wet n Wild Fergie To Reflect Shimmer Palette in Hollywood Boulevard (golden shimmer highlight) or Rose Golden Goddess (shimmery rosy bronze, highlight/blush in one). Other options are the Wet n Wild Coloricon Bronzers. Reserve Your Cabana is a great highlighter, and Ticket to Brazil and Bikini Contest are nice as muted blushes. eyeshadow palette. I love Wet n Wild's Comfort Zone palette. eyeshadow primer. I love Wet n Wild's Fergie eyeshadow primer. waterproof makeup remover. I love Maybelline Clean Express waterproof makeup remover. Even if you don't use waterproof makeup, this is an amazingly effective and gentle remover.   A good brush line is Real Techniques. They sell it at Ulta, or you can buy it from their website. They have good starter kits or you can buy the brushes individually.  To learn how to use the products, try following some Youtube tutorials! I like msroshposh, irishcel507, farahdhukai, Irene Mahmud Khan, and Makeup Game on Point."

brownbeauty,2y50jw,Anne_of_Avonlea,3,Fri Mar 6 19:58:51 2015 UTC,"If you're overwhelmed by her very thorough list one of the first products I would personally get is a peach colour corrector. I don't have much experience with this but Bobbi Brown is supposed to make some of the best ones for WOC. If you go to Sephora and like how it looks you can always go home and look for a dupe too. I personally think brightening/evening your eye area will make the biggest difference to your face :)     And, I don't think I've ever met a black woman who's needed an eyelash curler. (Unless your lashes curl down).      Also, don't buy from Avon unless it's nail polish, (because everything else isn't very good)."
brownbeauty,2y50jw,honeybuttery,2,Sat Mar 7 01:46:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you :) so I guess I won't need an eyelash curler,  and give Avon some credit, their perfume is pretty good too imo lol"

brownbeauty,2y50jw,AturOkem,2,Sat Mar 7 02:54:59 2015 UTC,For Bobbi Brown everything I've read has suggested the 'dark bisque' or 'deep bisque.' Whichever you think will be more orange on your skin tone would be better I'd think.
brownbeauty,2y50jw,AturOkem,1 point,Sat Mar 7 06:49:30 2015 UTC,"Also, for your lips it helps me to apply cocoa butter or vaseline on them before I go to bed. My lips used to peel on a regular basis (and chap when it's cold), but it's made a HUGE difference in how soft my lips are. Add a lip balm for daily use and you'll soften those lips right up."
brownbeauty,2y50jw,AturOkem,3,Sat Mar 7 02:51:37 2015 UTC,"Hi Maylene! I'm by no means a MUA but I also really like makeup and what it can do for my face when I need a pick-me-up. Youtube is a great resource for me, essentially where I do all of my research (I love researching makeup...it's almost as good as buying it. AMOST!). If possible, get into your local MAC or Sephora stores and don't be afraid to ask a million questions (and request samples!)  Things to think about as you research:  - Always keep in mind that your face will always be your face and it is beautiful in it's own right. Sometimes I get caught up in wanting to look a certain way and get bummed when I can't achieve a look.  It's really important because once you accept your face is permanent/your default/ perfect (however you want to think about), the easier it becomes to discern what you ACTUALLY want to buy and what really looks good on you. - You have a tone (cool/warm/neutral) to your skin and you want to keep it in mind when buying makeup. Certain eye shadows won't look right or your lipstick will appear to be gaudy when it's, in fact, the hue and tone of the products (it sounds really technical but as you experiment the concept becomes less convoluted) - Your makeup look will look infinitely better on happy skin.  Invest in better and healthier habits like drinking more water and washing your face and moisturizing.   Mmm, I'm not sure what you look like or what look you're going for but if you have any more questions, let me know. Enjoy playing and remember it's for you and about you!"

So, you must make a concious effor to change the way you speak about yourself (I still have to do that, too).  I really love a minimalist look, too. It allows you to look polished everyday and then a bold lip is suddenly fancy and it only took you an extra few minutes to apply! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWrOz5_Y_QE Destiny Godley looks similar to your shade and she's a very encouraging and skilled artist.

brownbeauty,2xod45,frumperbell,1 point,Tue Mar 3 04:04:05 2015 UTC,"That, my friend, is truly difficult to achieve. I think the setting spray keeps my makeup from fading/sliding off my face more than it keeps from rubbing off on things. That usually is usually left to the foundation itself to not do unfortunately :( To tell the truth, sometimes I spritz some hairspray on the makeup and that actually might keep the transfer down a bit, but some people's skin can't handle all that plus the makeup haha"

Ive learned that MUAs dont just put on a shitload of eye shadow for shits and giggles, it really does serve a purpose. Fading one colour into the next, creating shadows and light spaces. With this palette and your lovely unblemished skin (damn you), Id focus on building dimension. Maybe undiscovered on your lid, unbelievable in your crease as a transition colour and uncensored in your crease. Blending is also so important with the use of so many eyeshadows. Im not sure how that would show up, but Id love to see you rock another look with this palette. If you havent already, you should look into tight-lining your eyes and perhaps getting a warmer blush. That lip colour on you though..............ITS HOT."
brownbeauty,2xoa97,AturOkem,2,Mon Mar 2 15:38:24 2015 UTC,"I was trying to work with the matte colors with this one (couldn't resist untamed though), I'll definitely try the others next time. I just got the palette last week so I haven't experimented much! I struggle building up the darks for some reason, I don't know if it's the palette or if I'm just not applying it right, and I definitely struggle with the crease. Gotta practice!   With tightlining, do you mean top or bottom lid? I've been trying with the bottom lid occasionally, but I feel like I'm just making myself look tired...what should I be using? I feel the gel liner is too strong, and the shadows I have are too smudgy.  I very much struggle with blush :/ I got this one yesterday - asked the MUA at MAC with help for matching it with a specific outfit for an event. I do have a couple of other blushes to play with.   I am a sucker for matte lipsticks, I freakin love this one.  Thank you for the feedback!"
brownbeauty,2xp50q,settingfires,2,Mon Mar 2 19:13:53 2015 UTC,"That ""clean look"" is really only achievable with threading or waxing since they pull out all the super fine hairs that are very hard to get out with tweezers.  How do you feel about learning how to thread your own brows? That can give you that clean look but without your brows getting cut down."
brownbeauty,2xp50q,motor_mouth,1 point,Mon Mar 2 22:21:25 2015 UTC,Is threading easy to learn? I've heard of girls learning to thread but not being able to do it on themselves.  Plus I wouldn't trust myself with thread because I know how many ways there are to mess my brows up. I barely trust myself with the tweezers.  Definitely interested in learning though.
brownbeauty,2xp50q,motor_mouth,2,Thu Mar 5 01:53:10 2015 UTC,"It's not too bad, but I definitely recommend practicing on your leg first. After you get the hang of the back and forth motion, you can practice on your upper lip (or chin) and then finally your eyebrows.  There are a bunch of good Youtube tutorials."
brownbeauty,2xp50q,aliciosa14,1 point,Thu Mar 5 02:18:25 2015 UTC,What was the damage done by getting them threaded? Was it a skin issue or was it that they were getting too thin? I've been wanting to get mine threaded and a coworker told me about where she gets hers done. She just asks them to not to make them too thin and her eyebrows are really full but still have a nice arch and shape to them.
brownbeauty,2xp50q,feetintheair12,2,Tue Mar 3 00:21:08 2015 UTC,They were getting too thin. Every single time I went I told the person doing mine to please please please keep them thick and not even try shaping them. Still always turned out thin. Now my brows have sparse spots that I have to fill in all the time.
brownbeauty,2xp50q,aliciosa14,3,Tue Mar 3 00:33:13 2015 UTC,"Not sure where you live, but I'm a desi lady who lives in Texas and can give you decent threading recommendations. You may just have to wait for your brows to grow out and space out your threading trips to every month or so. I know what it's like having super duper thick brows and maintaining them. I try not to do anything (i.e., no plucking) in between visits and that helps me to maintain the shape/thickness."
brownbeauty,2xp50q,aliciosa14,1 point,Tue Mar 3 19:02:55 2015 UTC,"My brows are really sparse too from overplucking. To keep them clean while you're growing them out again, you could buy an eyebrow stencil from a place like sally's, put it down low where you want to clean up your brows, and using a white eyeliner just trace the bottom edge. And then pluck or thread everything below the line. Don't worry about shaping the top or anything while you're growing out your brows.  You can do that like once every week or however often you see that they're becoming too wack."
brownbeauty,2xp50q,Anne_of_Avonlea,1 point,Tue Mar 3 14:17:24 2015 UTC,Thanks for this! I never knew you could use a stencil for plucking! I will definitely check that out next time I go to Sally's. Is there a specific shape that is good for the arch?   I actually have to clean up my brows every day (even if its just one or two hairs) because the hairs are all crazy and grow at different phases so that I have a few hairs pop out even just a day after getting them threaded.
brownbeauty,2xp50q,noheaking,2,Tue Mar 3 18:32:43 2015 UTC,"They usually come with different kinds to best suit your face. The stencils themselves might be too thin but you can just use the bottom arch part of it. Also, before you pluck, make sure the white outline matches up closely for both eyebrows."
brownbeauty,2xp50q,saucyminxy,1 point,Tue Mar 3 20:15:19 2015 UTC,"I'm in your position exactly. My brows basically look like rainbows now thanks to threading. I've been trying to book an appt at a 'brow bar,' and it's a little steep at $30. But I really only want them to get shaped once every 3-6 months so I think it'll be worth it. Hopefully I like what the lady comes up with."
brownbeauty,2xgs52,faith_trustpixiedust,17,Sat Feb 28 15:20:35 2015 UTC,"Very! If you sleep with makeup on you will clog your pores with it and dirty your pillowcase which within a week will now have enough grease & grime to cause breakouts. Unless you are changing pillowcases every couple days that is a big no no.  If washing it off seems daunting because you are tired(I fell like this often), just use a wet makeup wipe, you can keep it on your nightstand and just wipe your face before you hit the hay."
brownbeauty,2xgs52,jingabobo,11,Sat Feb 28 17:57:26 2015 UTC,I tend to get zits if I dont wash my makeup off at the end of the night. It's just not worth it to sleep with makeup on; takes a week for the zit to go away.
brownbeauty,2xgs52,caramelsundae02,11,Sat Feb 28 16:33:25 2015 UTC,"tl;dr Very  When it comes to skincare, the thing I always tell my friends is, ""If you only do two things for your skin, 1) take off your makeup, and 2) use moisturizer.""  Sleeping with makeup on can break you out in the short term, and also clog your pores, leading to breakouts days or weeks later. Plus, leaving eye makeup on at night can also cause infection, styes and other gross stuff - I managed to give myself an eye infection this way. And just because it was fine the first hundred times, that doesn't mean it will be the 101st. On a non-skincare note, it can also permanently stain your pillows...I had no idea Revlon Colorstay could do that, but apparently it's possible.  My recommendation is to make an ""emergency skincare kit"" for those nights when you know you'll be too tired (or tipsy, that's usually my problem) to do your usual skincare routine. Keep a box of makeup remover wipes by your bed, or heck, even baby wipes work. Some people swear by Pond's Cold Cream and a washcloth to wipe it off. Personally, when I only have time for one step, I'll use an oil cleanser to remove my makeup and then rinse it all away. It's definitely better than nothing!"
brownbeauty,2xgs52,maeEast,2,Sat Feb 28 18:30:03 2015 UTC,That emergency skincare kit is a good idea!! Thanks
brownbeauty,2xgs52,itsadooozy,3,Sun Mar 1 00:31:43 2015 UTC,Yeah I would agree with u/jingabobo and say keep makeup remover wipes near yor bed so you can at least get off some of the heavy stuff like foundation and mascara. One or two nights with makeup on won't be too bad for your skin alone  but you should wash your pillow cover since it's been two nights in a row with makeup on it.

brownbeauty,2xduhu,moonjongup,3,Fri Feb 27 19:35:54 2015 UTC,"I've found that tarte blushes are notorious for forming films. I think it's because the brushes used tend to have natural oils from our skin which mix with the blush and cause it to harden. Unfortunately there's no way out other than using a clean brush each time (which is roo much work for me) but I usually use the cellotape trick once a week or so and it seems to help, without me have to scrape too much off."
brownbeauty,2xduhu,MyLittleLabMonkey,1 point,Fri Feb 27 20:57:11 2015 UTC,Could you describe the cellotape trick to me a bit more? I haven't heard of that before.
brownbeauty,2xduhu,MyLittleLabMonkey,2,Sat Feb 28 10:01:43 2015 UTC,"It's very simple - you take a piece of cellotape, and press the sticky side onto the surface of the product. What it does is then pull off some of the product (i.e. the film). It wastes less product than scraping, and it also less messy (since the powder is trapped by the sticky side, it doesn't get around everywhere). Keep repeating (using fresh tape) till you cover the surface of the product."
brownbeauty,2xduhu,chiffonandheels,2,Sat Feb 28 10:14:41 2015 UTC,"Aww, my best fried sent me the tarte rainforest after dark palette for my birthday and I was so excited to use it, and the unleashed blush that comes in it. Unfortunately, almost none of the shadows show up on my skin, and the blush is just chalky and awful. I know that unleashed is a tiny bit lighter than exposed, but I imagine because they're basically the same shade, my failure with unleashed would be mirrored if I tried exposed.   A lot of people rave about Tarte and I haven't found a product that works for me so far from their line. Maybe it's just me."
brownbeauty,2xbunt,Anne_of_Avonlea,17,Fri Feb 27 06:52:01 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty much what you said, whenever I see bad foundation on WOC it's because it's too light or it looks grayish. A lot of women around me tend to cake it on too much as well, so that doesn't look good."
brownbeauty,2xbunt,palster,8,Fri Feb 27 09:56:14 2015 UTC,"yep, lighter foundation and powder giving you ghost face. Mac's studio tech actually used to oxidize on me pretty badly, but in a way that didn't look so bad. It turned really orange but for some reason kind of just made me look like I had a tan at the same time. I couldn't figure out if I hated it or loved it XD."
brownbeauty,2xbunt,business_time_,3,Fri Feb 27 13:21:35 2015 UTC,"I've had foundations with bad color matches turn greenish (like too olive) on me which I hated but I don't think others noticed as much as I did. I've also had them turn orange, which looks fine on my skin tone. I can use or he as a corrector anyway so it really had a brightening effect on the skin.   Again, I feel like many of us know how to make foundation shades work for us because theres no other choice most of the time and you can get away with a lot using a light hand, it's when you get heavy handed and don't blend down your chin you look crazy!"

What you can try is buying a setting powder that is your skin color and use that all over the face on top of spot concealing. Then if you feel your forehead is looking too light, use a matte bronzer/darker finishing powder. I hate wearing foundation daily so concealer + setting powder is it. The problem is I have no recommendations for drugstore options as I mostly buy mid end stuff. :(  I use MUFE HD Invisible concealer(355) & also Bobbi brown color corrector(deep peach) for my under eyes.   I really like the MAC mineralized skin finish pressed powders & the CoverFX loose Setting powder(Medium). Also Becca has lovely pressed powders(Fawn)"
brownbeauty,2wdgj0,kalyani15,3,Fri Feb 20 01:04:41 2015 UTC,"I had this problem for a really long time as well. Just a note, this is my first post/response on reddit. I'm by no means a professional MUA, but I'd like to think I have a bit of experience with the beauty struggle.   Back to the OP: I've been reading a lot of Asian beauty blogs and one thing I really took notice of is that often one product is expected to work for the entire face/area. I'm guessing that you have somewhat sensitive skin, so you're trying to be careful with preventing more breakouts and get even coverage (medium-full?). Sometimes a different formula/brand will work better. I don't want to suggest colors because I'm not sure what colors will adjust and work best for you, but a few things that I definitely think can help you out are:    getting color matched at Sephora, Ulta or another beauty counter I use MUFE HD Invisible Cover Foundation and have had great success with the coloring I know some people who have adult acne and have found great success with Clinique and Est√©e Lauder Double Wear Stay in Place I know the cycle of buying and returning products all too well. Maybe try some of the more common drugstore brands out at Ulta before buying? L'Oreal Magic Nude Liquid Powder and True Match worked for me. And on that note of the return cycle, maybe get a sample from the counters/Sephora and try the product out for a few days before taking the plunge.      *Also try mixing some foundations, whether on your hand or on a palette before hand, to get a better color match. When the seasons change, I'm definitely darker during the summer and using this technique helps me acquire a more natural look.   I don't like to wear a full face of makeup either, but I've never really had much luck concealing and blending to make it look like I had an even face. I usually end up putting on a full face, but really lightly so it doesn't take a lot of time/makeup/effort and it still looks natural.  Sorry for the long post! I wish you luck with your search, I hope this helps a little! xx"
brownbeauty,2wdgj0,BunBunRN,1 point,Thu Feb 19 08:31:19 2015 UTC,"Hi, thanks for the responses! I don't have any pictures of myself sans-makeup right now, I'll take one and post it soon. I've gotten color matched using the color ID thing at Sephora as well as by hand - the former gave me back 3 different $40-50 foundations (out of my price range), and the latter was the Sephora brand foundation in Walnut, which again matched the lower part of my face ok but not my forehead.   I do have somewhat sensitive skin (on a retinoid cream), so my biggest issues are uneven skin texture from acne scarring and the large, red, raised spots I tend to get (finding a non-silicone primer has also been an issue. I'm currently using NYX HD Studio Photogenic primer, but it has blue undertones and makes me look paler so it's not the best solution). I'm reticent to buy multiple foundations and mix them because I don't think I'd be very good at it, especially when trying to get ready in a limited time frame, but it's definitely an option if I can't find one that fits better.   I've also heard that MUFE and MAC tend to break people out? I'll try and get some samples of MUFE and NARS next time I'm at Sephora and see if any of those work."
brownbeauty,2wdgj0,faith_trustpixiedust,1 point,Thu Feb 19 20:21:21 2015 UTC,I think you should be able to find your match with nars or Laura Mercier. Good luck!

They have samples you can buy abd ship the samples for free. I'd try that if I were you :). Helped me loads."
brownbeauty,2wdgj0,narwhool,1 point,Fri Feb 20 06:19:56 2015 UTC,"i suggest you use different foundations for your forehead and face and just blend really well. also, the tops of your forehead should be slightly warmer than your face...it gives the contoured, bronzed look."
brownbeauty,2wdgj0,1percentagarose,1 point,Thu Feb 19 16:31:38 2015 UTC,How about matching your foundation/concealer to the middle of your face and then using a darker contour powder around the edges of your face and forehead? This can help 'blend in' the ashiness and give you a more natural transition from light to dark. Like this girl: https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/74/a8/12/74a812d0cd4848581b8d4d8ab080e747.jpg  Her forehead and jaw are darker than her midface but by using both a dark and light color and blending she looks all one shade.
brownbeauty,2wdgj0,__Shadynasty_,1 point,Thu Feb 19 20:07:51 2015 UTC,"I use two foundations and mix to match the shade. One of them is 24h makeup which is thicker and a bit greasier, but I cut it with another lightweight but medium coverage foundation. I wash my face, apply moisturizer and medications, and then use a wetted (I just clean it right before using it and pat it dry) stipple brush to layer the foundation on. On areas that need more coverage, I go over them a few times, letting the thin layers of foundation dry to build coverage.   If you have discoloring between your forehead and the rest of your face, you might bronze/highlight to make things match a bit more. Aka use bronzer to contour your lower face and highlighter on your forehead area rather than using both at the same time in your whole face.   Good luck!"
brownbeauty,2w9i4l,maeEast,4,Wed Feb 18 01:49:56 2015 UTC,I know exactly how you feel! This same thing happened to me this past year with bareminerals bareskin. I never even returned it for the off chance that I will figure out one day how to make it work.
brownbeauty,2w9i4l,ayy_lmaoooo,3,Wed Feb 18 02:27:27 2015 UTC,Have you tried it in the sheer glow formula? It's a fan favorite for a reason. It is my holy grail that I keep going back to. Maybe even sheer matte since you're on the oily side. Good luck!
brownbeauty,2w9i4l,BunBunRN,3,Wed Feb 18 02:28:08 2015 UTC,"I'll do that - thank you so much for the suggestion. The SA at Sephora had told me that line was going to be continued, but some quick Googling suggests that not the case :)"
brownbeauty,2w9i4l,BunBunRN,3,Wed Feb 18 02:33:27 2015 UTC,I keep hearing sheer matte is being phased out but I believe sheer glow is sticking around. It would be dumb of them to get rid of it.
brownbeauty,2w9i4l,BunBunRN,3,Wed Feb 18 03:59:36 2015 UTC,"Well, worse decisions have been made. St Ives is discontinuing their exfoliating pads, which is basically their single best-selling item. I hope NARS doesn't go a similar direction with this one :/  Edit: Okay, no, it's definitely being phased out. I just went to try to buy it from Nordstrom online, and there are only three shades left in stock. Balls. The sheer glow definitely won't be enough coverage for me."
brownbeauty,2w9i4l,MixxedOpinion,3,Wed Feb 18 04:03:49 2015 UTC,Still worth a try. I don't need a lot of coverage and it works for me. My mom has mature but problematic skin and it somehow works for her too.
brownbeauty,2w9i4l,settingfires,3,Wed Feb 18 04:20:03 2015 UTC,"""Problematic"" in what way? I'm super oily, and I worry that would kinda screw things up"
brownbeauty,2w9i4l,jingabobo,3,Wed Feb 18 04:31:27 2015 UTC,"I've found that sheer glow actually has some really good coverage, despite the name. I have a few really dark hyperpigmentation marks, and it covers them completely. I'd get a sample and test it out!"
brownbeauty,2w9i4l,jingabobo,3,Wed Feb 18 04:23:28 2015 UTC,If you're specifically interested in making your skin tone less red I highly recommend tarte's CC primer stick. It is a decent primer but it comes in light medium and dark shades so it works really well for me. Is your skin oily or dry? I have fairly oily skin and it really helped with the oil too but I imagine it would dry out nor mal or dry skin.   It's something to check out at sephora and see if you like it before buying. It's pretty expensive (IMO) but it has lasted me a while and it helped my skin a lot. Also make sure to moisturize before using this because it seems to sit on top of skin without it.   Edit: the primer is good at making a good base so you don't need a ton of layers of foundation. I personally also use the garnier bb cream with it and it was perfect. I never had luck with all the different shades high end companies make but pretty much any medium foundation/bb cream works better because they're meant to be more flexible.  Edit 2: I've heard some people don't like this product too much but I think its worth trying out. Something that doesn't work for other people is probably more likely to work for you (and me - people who's skin doesn't work well with the more popular products).
brownbeauty,2w9i4l,jingabobo,1 point,Wed Feb 18 18:22:52 2015 UTC,"Ooh, I hadn't considered Tarte - I personally hate their Amazonian Clay foundation (it makes me even oilier than I already am), but the primer stick might be a whole nother ball game. I'll see if I can find a mini of it anywhere."
brownbeauty,2w9i4l,sporkfaced,2,Wed Feb 18 20:08:39 2015 UTC,Try the sheer glow or even their tinted moisturizer paired with tge creamy concealer for coverage. The weightless foundation works great on my face except around my mouth. I suspect its because of the fuzzy baby hair. :(

Only problem is the maintenance throughout the day, and you cannot have chapped lips or it shows. :(  Here I'm wearing     Lips : KVD studded kiss lipstick in Countess Eyes : Nectar, Mocha from Lorac Pro 2 & used black eyeshadow instead of eyeliner for a softer more hazy look. On my Brows I have on sephora Retractible eyebrow pencil in Soft Charcoal. Face : Becca pressed SSP in Topaz. Blush from the Tarte RFAD palette.   Testing out the Nars luminous weightless foundation in Tahoe. It is ver thin and you will forget you're wearing foundation. It is quite pigmented so almost full coverage.   It dries very quickly so apply and blend in parts instead of dotting the whole face in one go.   I think this will not apply well on dry/flaky skin. Also I noticed it was a bit patchy around my mouth. Moisturize well before applying this.  Also, it does not layer that well after 2 coats, and since it's so lightweight you will be tempted to put more on like you do with other BB's or foundations. You really don't need to pack it on. Just 2 drops will cover your whole face and still look natural.  Otherwise a great product that everyone needs to sample for sure."

For blush...hmm....i'd say it depends on what sort of eyeshadow you're rocking for the day. If you're doing something more neutral, and you want to play off of the color of the lipstick, i'd recommend ""So Sweet So Easy"" by MAC because you can blend it out (so it's more of a cheek stain versus a blush).   If you're doing a smokey eye, maybe something like Too Faced Sweethearts Perfect Flush Brush in ""Something About Berry"". It's a really nice bronzer/blush combination, so you can highlight and shade your face well, and it's something you can rock all year long! Hope this helps!"

The outpouring of support from the community (Muslim, College, everyone, really) here is overwhelming, But it hits close to home, and it's really frustrating. I was actually a part of the Duke MSA for a little bit my freshman year and a lot of my friends stayed through their undergrad career. When we heard about the adhan cancel at Duke, we were dismayed, but we chalked it up to islamaphobia and xenophobia. When the shooting happened, my dismay turned to anger and frustration. Honestly, these kids were the outstanding stars of our generation and they were killed over their religion. It's a hate crime, no matter how the media spins it and for what its worth, my friends are in arms about it.   Ugh, I didn't really articulate my thoughts well at all, but I'm just sick of it, and it's fucked up that this happened."

What are your hair types? and what's your current routine?  Mine is 3b / 3c (growing out relaxer). My routine is: Co wash or water wash massaging my scalp thouroughly, finger comb in the shower, scrunch towel dry, add argan oil if needed +/ a hard styling oil to the shaved sides if needed. I do this max twice a week, but try to go as long as I can without washing it. Bundling my hair up at night in a scarf helps keep frizz at bay and seems to make it feel less dry.

It dries to a matte finish and the gel texture keeps my hairs in place. I try to match my eyebrows as close to my hair color as posible. I like a somewhat thicker brow w/ an arch- only because I'm currently growing my brows out.  I apply the dip brow w/ a two sided brush (spoolie and angled eyeliner brush), and I clean up the bottom of my brows w/ Maybelline Fit Me concealer in the shade Cafe - it is 1-2 shades lighter than my skintone, which is why I use it as an under-eye highlight."
brownbeauty,2v0yfb,toofacedjas,3,Sat Feb 7 07:10:17 2015 UTC,"My fave product is Tarte Amazonian Waterproof Clay Brow Mousse. It's $28 and it comes with a double ended spoolie/angled brow brush for application.   With color, I like to match the color with my brows as best as possible.  I just brush out my brows to follow their natural line, then use the angled party to fill them in from the bottom of the lash and lightly brushing them up (underscoring). This helps because the product is so pigmented a little goes a very long way. After I do that, I blend with the spoolie."
brownbeauty,2v0yfb,LaFemmeFatale24,3,Fri Feb 6 21:38:47 2015 UTC,"My favorite product is Rimmel's eyebrow pencil in Black Brown because I'm too cheapass to get high end products (that probably work better). I just love the pencil because it has a dry formula so it can look natural, has a spooly on the cap, and has the perfect shade of ashy brown which matches my hair color very well. Oh and it usually retails under $5.  My technique is pretty much using the pencil alone for a daily look, and filling the outer corners for a special event where I need long lasting power browers.   I just go with my own brow shape, but straighten the fronts a bit since they curve down naturally. As far as in the trend? Yes I think my brows are a bit thicker since it's in style, but I'm definitely not repping Instagram brows here.  Yeah, so everyone here is posting really good products that, again, I'm sure are super good. But if you're looking for a brow product that is dirt cheap and portable, think about Rimmel. Then again the cons for it is that the cap gets loose for some odd reason and always slips off, and also I feel like this is no longer being sold in stores anymore. Perhaps it's being discontinued? If that's so you never even read this post."
brownbeauty,2v0yfb,sinabimo,1 point,Sat Feb 7 08:30:51 2015 UTC,I really liked it too!  I had to switch to WnW's Mink Brown though because I could never find it anymore.
brownbeauty,2v0yfb,frumperbell,2,Sat Feb 7 14:03:18 2015 UTC,"I like that the current trend is for full brows.  I suffered from tragic over plucking and waxing in my twenties.  Worst of all, anytime I had my brows professionally done, I'd break out.  No matter what.  Now that they've grown back in, all I do as far as up keep is brush them into shape, and then pluck anything that's growing outside the shape I want them to be in.    As far as products, so far my favorite way to do my brows is to brush them into shape, lightly fill them in, and then gel them into place.    My favorite brow filler is WnW Mink Brown pencil.  It's perfect.  I know it's practically heresy to say so, but I like it even better than Dipbrow.  My favorite brow gel is Milani's Clear Brow Gel."
brownbeauty,2v0yfb,frumperbell,2,Fri Feb 6 23:23:52 2015 UTC,"I just got into brows, but I'm pretty obsessed.    I have Dipbrow in Dark Brown, which fades into my brow hair and makes it look fuller without being overdone, and I use either the zoeva brow line (?) brush or the wing liner brush from the real techniques nic's picks kit.   I also have the nyx brow gels in espresso and black, which I use with a fine liner brush (otherwise it's way too strong and obvious).  I usually mix them together,  but currently I'm just using espresso because I have lighter coloured extensions in.   And lastly for super quick days,  I have the maybelline brow drama pencil and mascara in dark brown.  I use one or the other (or both) when I'm running late or not wearing much makeup.   I have fairly full brows, so this is mostly to even and fill out my tails. I've been doing my own plucking/shaping since I had a massive breakout after my last waxing,  but I'm thinking of getting them threaded sometime once I grow them out a bit.   TL;DR: I use a lot of stuff."
brownbeauty,2v0yfb,blackgirldownunder,2,Sat Feb 7 01:56:49 2015 UTC,"I like using Anastasia Beverly Hills Dipbrow in Ebony, or if I can't find that, black eyeshadow. Ebony is sliiightly lighter than my hair color. The brown-ness isn't noticeable in most lighting though."
brownbeauty,2v0yfb,MintyLotus,4,Sat Feb 7 06:25:23 2015 UTC,"I have very dark full bushy brows which I have to get threaded every few weeks.   In terms of brow products, I own Anastasia dip brow in dark brown and if you're even remotely interested in purchasing this product you MUST buy her #12 brush. This product is quite finicky and takes time to master but you get a lot of product. Sometimes I do wish I wore tinted brow gel though"

brownbeauty,2ukhld,ThinkRadical,3,Tue Feb 3 02:46:17 2015 UTC,"Wow, thank you so much!   For my eyeliner I use an angled brush and gel, which makes it easier to keep in control. Liquid tends to sting my eyes and make them water and then it always fucks up.  I start with a thin line from the end to the middle, then go from the inner corner to the middle to finish the line, then draw a thicker line down from the outer corner to shape the wing. After that it's just trying to get the two eye-lines looking even, I usually like to do a wing (my eyes are close set and that makes them a little wider) but the thickness and angle of it tends to vary daily."
brownbeauty,2ujqoo,Anne_of_Avonlea,2,Mon Feb 2 19:29:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I've used their eyeliner pen and that's it. I liked it and it was my first ever liner when I started wearing makeup."
brownbeauty,2ujqoo,LaFemmeFatale24,2,Mon Feb 2 20:21:17 2015 UTC,"I use their lip gloss, the pH matchmaker I think it's called? It's fabulous. I use the light pink shade and it somehow always gives me a great color.. the gloss is supposed to balance the pH in your lips or something and give you your own unique shade. I'm not sure how it works but it does the trick for me!"
brownbeauty,2ujqoo,espresso-patronum,2,Mon Feb 2 20:22:01 2015 UTC,"I have the Shimmer Strip in Sunset Strip and I have mixed feelings on it. The colour-way is great for dark skin, but I bought it to be a ""bronzer"" and it unfortunately isn't deep/pigmented enough for that. I think the colours look great on the lid. It's nice as a highlight if layered over a cream product, if you don't layer then the pigmentation disappears. Layered, it has more depth but for the amount of steps it isn't significantly better than High Beam."
brownbeauty,2ujqoo,KelsayLilay,1 point,Mon Feb 2 23:51:28 2015 UTC,"I also have the shimmer strip and love it as a highlight (but only over liquid foundation).

brownbeauty,2u9ap9,Brompton_Cocktail,6,Sat Jan 31 00:46:59 2015 UTC,"Your neck, face, and body might be NC40-42, but the back of your hand looks really, really fair. I think lip swatches would be a good idea because I'm not sure how much help swatches will be on your complexion when the skin you swatched them on looks a lot lighter than NC42.  I think you could also stand to maybe use a finer pen or maybe digitally add the text."
brownbeauty,2u9ap9,Samovi,1 point,Sun Feb 1 03:00:46 2015 UTC,I did these really quickly and i have horrible lighting. I assure you that my hands are darker than my face and are definitely NC42 possibly darker.   The text was only for my needs to distinguish between the colors not for anyone else.
brownbeauty,2u9ap9,Samovi,1 point,Sun Feb 1 07:21:35 2015 UTC,"Maybe you could try with natural lighting or adjust for a white balance? If your lighting skews the color of your skin to this degree, it's skewing the color of the swatches as well.  I guess that's good news about the text. I just write down the order on a sheet of paper and edit it in. I've seen people write it in successfully as well, but in this case I think it kind of distracts from the swatches since they're not legible and bigger than the swatches themselves."

As for the company, I can say that they are honestly fantastic. The shop owner is really good about responding to messages, and if you tell her you need something by a certain date, she does try to get your products to you by that date.   And, I don't know if she still does this, but you also get some small samples with your purchases. When I bought Black Lagoon and Lux et Volupitas (no pictures of that one, for some reason), I got samples of an eye shimmer and  a different lipstick."

As an NC 42 - 45 gal myself, people have said ""you look like you came in from the cold, your cheeks are flushed"" to me when I wore a wash of pink blushes on the apple o my cheeks.

brownbeauty,2tx2c1,hipster11kitty,4,Wed Jan 28 02:38:14 2015 UTC,"Is your hair completely black or dark brown? You can always use a demi-permanent dye like Manic Panic. it's super safe because it's basically vegetable dyes in conditioner and it gives dark hair a nice sheen of colour in the light. Washes out in 2-3 weeks though.   I've used these types of colours a lot for my north indian hair, on dark brown and on bleached hair. In particular, bright pink shows up as a plum-ish colour on dark hair..   Like the other poster said, your other option is henna, but I personally think it tends to make my hair coarser in texture and I'm not a fan of the reddish colour you get out of it."
brownbeauty,2tx2c1,xxoyez,3,Wed Jan 28 04:20:29 2015 UTC,"Uhhh, do you mean that your hair colour seems black indoors and the dyed colour outdoors?   If so, I have some experience with Henna dying my hair, and the first few times I used it, it had that effect. Outside my hair seemed to have a reddish/brown tinge. The more I used it, the more prominent the tinge? Afterwards, I switched to the Garnier box dyes, in the auburn shade, and still the dye wasn't as effective the few times, and my hair was much darker than what showed up on the box. But for the look you're going for, I'd consider Henna dyeing (assuming you wanted a reddish/brown for your ""unnatural"" colour)"

I'm not sure of my exact skin tone but I know that I am not NW45 (my realizing that that foundation was turning me orange is what inspired this purchase).  This was my first time making swatches so please excuse the messiness! I also got a lot of samples of their foundation (4 and 5 in Bengal, Siamese, Abyssiniam, Korat, Chartreux) and am willing to swatch those too if people are interested!"

brownbeauty,2tq6th,Lewyso,5,Mon Jan 26 15:29:00 2015 UTC,"This swatch was requested by someone on Saturday in a different post and it took me forever to deliver (sorry!) I am about NC45 and I love this color. I've gotten tons of compliments on it. In the picture, I am just wearing the lipstick not the lipglass. I have both if you would like them swatched together or a swatch of just the lipglass. I love the amplified creme formula. The lipstick goes on smoothly and pretty opaque in one swipe. The color last for a few hours and leaves a nice pink stain behind. I don't think the color is as intense as it looks in the tube, though the color can be toned down with lipliner. So far, I've worn it with Nightmoth and Brick. The SA at the MAC counter I bought it from www wearing Currant, which also look nice and muted the color to a nice dark-toned berry. I think this shade will look lovely on a lot of brown beauties."

brownbeauty,2tmo20,Prinsessa,2,Mon Jan 26 03:33:55 2015 UTC,Niiiice. I love Plato's Closet! FFA = female fashion advice. Your look is so awesome. I think you'd add to the sub. It could use more variety and risk taking imo.

brownbeauty,2tofoa,tropfou,6,Mon Jan 26 02:14:07 2015 UTC,I think you could experiment with highlighting and contouring using your normal foundation color as a contour and your foundation that matches your neck as your highlight if that makes sense. You could blend the colors down to your neck as well
brownbeauty,2tofoa,Brompton_Cocktail,2,Mon Jan 26 03:44:41 2015 UTC,"I was told to pick which shade you want,preferably the lighter because it's easier to darken up with bronzer or contouring than lightening up. My neck and face are drastically different then my body,since I prefer my very tan face I just bronze my chest if I wear a lower shirt."
brownbeauty,2tofoa,acinomismonica,2,Mon Jan 26 12:09:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with online & just match your neck. especially if you're 2-3x darker, I'd want to avoid that ""floating head syndrome""."
brownbeauty,2tofoa,leblady,8,Mon Jan 26 12:58:33 2015 UTC,"But if her neck is 2-3x lighter than her face and she matches her foundation to her face, she runs the risk of looking like her face is really ashy. She'll also have the cake on the foundation to cover up the darker skin.   OP: I think it would be easier for you to match to your face colour and then blend down towards your neck.... or pick a shade in between your neck and face and blend."
brownbeauty,2tofoa,creamcheesefiasco,2,Mon Jan 26 13:51:37 2015 UTC,I match my neck/chest or it looks wayy too weird
brownbeauty,2tofoa,real-rainicorn,1 point,Mon Jan 26 13:49:42 2015 UTC,"This is going to sound silly, but do you lotion/moisturize your neck before you put on your makeup? I started doing this a few years ago and noticed that my neck was a lot easier to blend with my face afterwards. The dryer skin there made my neck look darker than it was. Anyways, even if this is not the case I always found that it was easier to blend face down to neck. I don't like foundation on my neck so much, but I at least try to lightly apply the blotting powder or setting powder there. I do this after I drag the foundation down to at least a little past my chin area (including under the chin). It always looks like a more aesthetically pleasing transition to me."
brownbeauty,2tmx7a,l0l0lol0l0l,8,Sun Jan 25 18:52:12 2015 UTC,NC is for warm yellow tones and NW is for cooler pink tones. You were right and the girl was wrong.
brownbeauty,2tmx7a,glaceauglaceau,3,Sun Jan 25 20:13:52 2015 UTC,"I would say that the general advice of more yellow/orange skin-tones to go with NC is correct, in my experience. While NC tends to be too orange for me, NW is too pink and leaves me looking gray"

brownbeauty,2tlbhz,stufstuf,2,Sun Jan 25 10:20:40 2015 UTC,They are seriously that orange! Actually unwearable for me. If you like bright colors you should try them only $5.99 each so not a big commitment.

My favorite SA trusted the Sephora color match system too well, even when I told her that I was already matched to the darkest shade in one of the brands, but it matched me to medium. Now I have to match my foundation all by myself because another SA gave me ghost face when matching me by eye. And she was black too!"
brownbeauty,2tlrcu,c3bysparrow,2,Sun Jan 25 12:30:14 2015 UTC,"That happened to me! The lady working the No7 counter put all her faith in their colour match system and I kept telling her that it was dark in the wrong undertone and she just wasn't having any of it. Booo lady, boo you."

brownbeauty,2tlrcu,coconewt,2,Mon Jan 26 00:26:57 2015 UTC,I had a Mac associate try to sell me a concelear way too light for me. I also had reverse panda eyes. Im nc43. It's really discouraging because I see people leave makeup counters perfectly done but when I go to one its like I'm an experiment to find matching colors.
brownbeauty,2th75y,faith_trustpixiedust,3,Sat Jan 24 03:09:17 2015 UTC,"Where do you work? Some places wouldn't be appropriate for this kind of makeup while other places have a more relaxed dress code.   Based just off the pictures I think you're right, a nice nude lip color or tinted lip balm would look better than that colorful lip. The cat eyes are also a little too bold, I'd go smaller wings or no wings at all, just a thin line along the upper lashline or tightlining.   Another thing that would help is bringing the crease color down a bit and blending it out more. Right now there are lines, you could blend it to make it more seamless."
brownbeauty,2th75y,glaceauglaceau,3,Sat Jan 24 05:42:45 2015 UTC,"I work at a high end clothing store.. Think.. Prada or something. The ladies here are done up as if everyday is a NY fashion week runway show. They actually would like for us to look our best, and if wearing makeup does that then so be it. I do NEED to wear navy, so I wanted to make sure the color doesn't clash. Thank you so much for replying!  I think I'll just not do the cat eyes. Tightlining?  Actually I didn't use a crease color. I just used the black for my outer v, but I guess I can blend it a little more, but I'm honestly not sure where to. Do i just blend all over or in specific places?  Also, do you have any tips for falsies? I applied the and to me it looks a bit obvious. I don't have a tweezer to apply them, and using my hands I feel like I leave a big gap and i could have gotten closer to my lash line. I do my left eye better than my right. I'm right handed, so idk why that is."
brownbeauty,2th75y,glaceauglaceau,2,Sat Jan 24 06:05:39 2015 UTC,Tightlining is applying liner or shadow to the roots of your lashes and in between them. Think lining your upper waterline but closer to the lashes.   There are some good tutorials on blending on YouTube. I'll try to find some for you.   False lashes are always a giant pain for me too. I've found a good glue is essential. So is bending them to fit the curve of your eye and making sure they're not too long for your lashline. And looking down into a mirror helps.
brownbeauty,2th75y,__Shadynasty_,2,Sat Jan 24 06:10:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they are definitely too long. My eyes started to water while I was wearing them from irritation, and then they just lifted off anyway :/. I used the duo lash glue. I'll definitely be cutting them in the morning. Maybe some mascara will also help. I need to remember looking down into a mirror! I was looking perpendicular, straight at the mirror."
brownbeauty,2th75y,maeEast,3,Sat Jan 24 06:40:38 2015 UTC,"That looks great!!!  I actually really like the lipstick on you with the eye shadow, but is is definitely extreme. (I am personally very scared to try bold lip colors!!)   Keep trying different color combos!!!  When in doubt white goes with just about everything, and you pretty much can't go wrong with doing a light color surrounded by a dark color!"

brownbeauty,2t6zhl,Anne_of_Avonlea,7,Wed Jan 21 18:11:01 2015 UTC,"I would probably color match to the darker spots, if only because it's easier to cover light spots with a darker color as opposed to dark spots with a lighter color. My nose is darker/redder than the rest of my face, and I have a heck of a time getting coverage with foundation that matches my cheeks/neck/etc."
brownbeauty,2t6zhl,maeEast,6,Wed Jan 21 22:41:34 2015 UTC,"This is tough because if you have foundation that's too light, you can always try to match it to your face/neck with contouring, but if you have foundation that's too dark for your face  but matches your neck, you can highlight and try to mitigate the darkness. She could always mix foundations to find a good medium shade."

brownbeauty,2t5cm9,faith_trustpixiedust,4,Wed Jan 21 07:03:24 2015 UTC,"I think you did a great job!  My advice, and it's very much take it or leave it, is to not be afraid to play with color when it comes to you eye shadow. We have similar skin tones, and I've learned that because we are so dark we can kinda get intense with the eye shadow and still look appropriate.   I tend to blend at the minimum two, and sometimes up to four, colors every day, add eye liner and mascara to complete the look. I've gotten compliments from everyone from bosses to strangers for it.   If you don't know what colors go together, just pull up a color wheel, if two colors touch or are the exact opposite on the wheel then they are fair game together. Or look at your favorite outfit and pick whatever colors are on it!! Good luck!!"

You can also focus on reds and yellows with Navy. (honestly Navy is so versatile it will probably go with anything, if you would wear the color as a shirt with blue jeans you can probably do it as eye shadow with a navy uniform in my personal opinion)"
brownbeauty,2t5cm9,cautionyellow,4,Wed Jan 21 22:14:03 2015 UTC,"I really like that lip colour on you. Maybe consider getting a universal lip liner or something like no bleeding lips so it doesn't feather out on your lips. You have such beautiful lips that it would nice with a crisper liner.  If you're considering a nice eye palette set, I personally like the Maybelline nudes. I really like the golds in that palette and it's so cheap!  Side note, I like your brows thick. Maybe just a gel and penciling the tails. Ugh you have such beautiful skin."

I'm not sure how I feel about the color, most likely because I'm not used to seeing myself with lipstick, but I will definitely invest in the liner!! I have a natural bow in my loops abd it would be nice to emphasize that, abd keep lipstick from getting all over my face, haha. Where can I find the maybelline nudes palette?   Thanks for the brows comment. My mom feels the opposite. She calls me wolfy :/ haha!"
brownbeauty,2t5cm9,__Shadynasty_,1 point,Wed Jan 21 17:34:40 2015 UTC,"I felt the same way too but I think it's because naturally our lips are darker at the edges so seeing it with one FULL colour looks a little weird. Consider using different colours - a darker one near the edges to give it some dimension or an ""ombre"" effect. Also, try blotting and setting your lipstick with foundation then reapplying. There are a lot of great tutorials on here, so take advantage of that. I like to put a little white eyeliner on my cupids bow so it emphasizes my lips.   I got my palette from Wal-Mart. It's pretty cheap - no more than 14 bucks I'd say?   My mom is the worst. She comments on my makeup daily, ""You look like a cartoon character. That shade of red makes you look like a clown."" But look who goes rummaging in my tool box when I'm at work.....GO AWAY MA!"

brownbeauty,2t3r7k,frumperbell,2,Tue Jan 20 22:51:42 2015 UTC,Quick question have you tried the two lighter colors on your face? The grey hue is a little off putting for me so I was wondering whether it appears as grey on you
brownbeauty,2t3r7k,Brompton_Cocktail,1 point,Wed Jan 21 00:59:32 2015 UTC,"I just got them last night so not yet.  But I know what you mean about the grey seeming weird.    Shiro Cosmestics came out with a line of bronzing powders a few months ago.  I was really disappointed because they were all light and warm, except for An East Wind Coming, which was grey.  Everyone said it was a dupe for a Chanel product and worked really well, but I was like yeah, ok.  I finally got a sample in a swap the other day, and it's magic.  Here's a FOTD I did the other day with it and the new CQ CC Cream, which is also magic.  I didn't do a review of it yet because Shiro finally released 2 more cool shades this week, and I want to do all three at once.  tl;dr Grey Contour Powder sounds weird but it gives a really natural shadow effect."

brownbeauty,2sqje2,asuka_is_my_co-pilot,3,Sat Jan 17 20:35:31 2015 UTC,piggybacking on this: good bronzer for yellow tones
brownbeauty,2sqje2,Brompton_Cocktail,4,Sun Jan 18 23:22:14 2015 UTC,"1) Foundation with yellow/golden/green undertones! The closest I've been able to find are Asian BB creams, which tend to have very light coverage and be way too moisturizing for my oily skin. Also, ashy bronzer. Every bronzer on the market is too light and turns bright pinkish orange on me.  2) I prefer liquid foundations for the longevity factor, though I always use a powder over the top. Matte finish is preferable to ""glowy"", usually, since I'm greasy enough to get a glow no matter what. Stick concealer has worked best for me, though I've yet to find a formula I really like.  3) I want to say ""pastels"", but I've resigned myself to the fact that my undertones make those a no-go. I would love to see some neutrals in a shade other than pale/peach, though. Like maybe taupe-ish neutrals?   4) Depends on the product. I assume you're talking about lipstick mainly, in which case matte is my first choice, but satin is also good"

brownbeauty,2sqkv1,LykingIt,4,Sat Jan 17 15:23:13 2015 UTC,"I'm an NC42, and I purchased the Shade SX11. This shade is a fairly good match for my olive undertones, but I found that once I applied it all over my face that it runs a little too pale, so I just pop in some yellow & brown mixing mediums from Life's Entropy (an indie brand) and it fixes it. I have very oily, acne-prone skin, so I use either my KVD Rehab primer or Hourglass Mineral Veil underneath, and a powder over top of the foundation (Tarte Smooth Operator finishing powder or MUFE Duo Mat). With this method, I find I can go 5-6 hours before any touch ups are needed, which is awesome.   When you apply it, you really only do need the tiniest bit, and I recommend buffing it out with a dense buffing brush and smoothing it over with a type of beauty blender sponge, this will give you very full coverage. It will cover any pigmentation issues, redness etc. I have not had any acne since using this product, so all in all it's a winner for me. You get 18 grams of this product, and it will last you a very long time.   If you want to purchase a sample, camera ready cosmetics has them available at very affordable prices!"
brownbeauty,2sqkv1,purplepingu,1 point,Sun Jan 18 02:23:17 2015 UTC,"Do you find that adding the mixing mediums changes the texture/wearability. Part of the reason I've been admiring these is because of how well they work on their own. And you were so thorough, unbelievably helpful!"

brownbeauty,2sn2vp,meanjeanmakeup,8,Fri Jan 16 16:29:14 2015 UTC,Some lovely color combinations there! I would suggest to not bring the purple up as high on the brow bone. Wiping some of it off with a Q tip and then blending it softly with a clean blending brush will give youa softer more hazy transition into the brow bone area.

Another photo, my natural lip color really looks like something in between the two pictures. I wear Mac NC45/Revlon Colorstay in Caramel/in the winter BareMinerals Bareskin in Bare Honey #15.  My favorite neutral lip color is Maybelline Color Elixir in Intoxicating Spice. It's a warm reddish plum. Here it is in bathroom lighting. Here it is paired with a slightly darker eye and the darker eye in bathroom lighting.   Next up is Wet n Wild Mocha-licious #914C matte lipstick. It's a dark taupey plum which matches my upper lip color. Please excuse my cross eyed weirdness.   Wet n Wild Urban Nights is a dark reddish plum. Applied sheer it looks neutral, applied more heavily it looks like a warm berry.   This is Wet n Wild Coming in Latte which is a warm tan. Here is a bathroom lighting picture. I think I need a brown lip liner to wear this one, I find it a little too light and warm for me.   This is NYX Color lip balm in Obrigado a very sheer warm red.   This is Essence Stay With Me Longlasting lip gloss in #11 Choose Me!  which is a warm sheer plum. This was my favorite neutral lip color until they discontinued it this year.   This is Michael Kors lipgloss in Icon. A sheer plum, comes across more like a clear lip gloss.   This is Urban Decay Lip Junkie lipgloss in Flushed. It is a very cool toned pale pink. I wouldn't wear it by itself but it's ok paired with a dark lipstick.  I actually rarely ever wear neutral or nude lip colors, I prefer brighter colors like red. Still I hope this was useful. It kind of made me want to try wearing neutral colors more often. Cheers!"

brownbeauty,2sjivg,FreeRangeGirl,3,Thu Jan 15 18:58:16 2015 UTC,"I thought I'd post a swatch+review of blushes I've come to reach out most often. I had a 'blush stage' for couple of years when I sampled and bought (and returned) many, this is the distilled list. I am so happy to finally have a collection I am content with.  For reference,   I am NC42 with brown eyes, dry skin.   I used my finger for swatching and blended out swatches using Real Technique's Contour Brush.   Pictures taken in day light, but not direct sunlight.   Please feel free to ask me any questions about these and CCW.  PS: People say that I ""need"" to buy NARS Taj Mahal; this may be blasphemous here, but I feel like I have 'enough' make-up already. Not crazy about adding stuff anymore unless I run out of one of these."
brownbeauty,2siv3w,c3bysparrow,5,Thu Jan 15 15:52:49 2015 UTC,"It's been almost a week since the sneak peek, are you excited? I am! So let's have a chat about the Viseart Eyeshadow Palette in 01 Neutral Mattes.  Let me preface this by saying, I have extremely sensitive eyes. I can't open my eyes underwater in pools, the chlorine could probably blind me. Just being near pools makes my eyes water. I've gone out of my way to find the gentlest makeup remover for my eyes, so I'm particular about my eye makeup.  That said, the Viseart palette is filled with a lovely range of neutral shades that flatter all skin tones. For us ladies of color, the lighter top row could be used to blend colors into lighter shades or easier to blend bases for your lids.  The Viseart palettes; eyeshadow, concealer, and lip, all have very simple space saving packaging. Since it's a brand mainly marketed to makeup artists, having pretty palettes isn't what's important.  Colors that caught my eye: That orange is to die for. This palette really reminded me of the Kat Von D Ladybird palette and one of it's best features was a wonderful orange (Cleopatra?). Also that grey looked like it would make a sexy smokey eye.  After swatching, I noticed that with too much pressure these tend to be quite powdery, which is a huge negative if the fallout gets in my eyes (remember, sensitive eyes). Also, the grey color was impossible to get a good swatch out of, that one's the only one that was passed more than once after desperately rubbing the pan.  Finally, I actually put the product on my eyes. Again, it's amazingly pigmented, you get nearly opaque color the first layer you pan on. UNFORTUNATELY, I WAS BLINDED BY RIDICULOUS FALLOUT AND COULDN'T SEE. I'm about 59% sure the fallout is mostly a problem in the darker shades.  I had to tap off so much product over the sink in order to apply with minimal eye stinging. I'm going to attribute this issue to my own lack of skill rather than the palette (I pick up a lot of product on the first go), but it is something to consider before you drop $80 on this palette. At that price, this would've formed into my only palette and I would've had to destash the Hourglass so everything gets equal usage.  MY EYES!  Final Thoughts:  Quality: Smooth, pigmented, very very powdery and prone to fallout.  Wear time: About 5-6 hours on my oily lids, probably longer with primer!  Repurchase? DESTASH."
brownbeauty,2siv3w,whythehecknot,1 point,Thu Jan 15 15:53:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for review!  I've been lusting after this palette for months and the swatches look beautiful.  For $80 though, I was hoping they would perform outstandingly, but since this isn't the case, I will remove it from my Sephora Loves list."
brownbeauty,2si03t,ElizadeathTaylor,2,Thu Jan 15 09:04:54 2015 UTC,"I got two of these eyeshadow stacks on Monday, so I've been playing around with them and I think I might have found a few dupes for them!   All of the ""eye"" swatches were applied with no primer and no other products aside for some mascara.   Also the eyeshadow application got a little patchy by the time I got to ""Fixated"" and ""Love Sick"" because my eyelids were dry and raw from rubbing off the last two eyeshadows lol. They don't apply patchy at all though!   Let me know if you guys have any questions, I have a detailed review on my blog here, and I'm having a giveaway for the other Love Sick eyeshadow stack that I got. Let me know if it's not cool that I list this here and I can take it down :)"

Usually the exfoliating ingredient is ground walnut shells, which are super-sharp, and can cause microscopic tears in your skin that make it more prone to infection over time.   Check out /r/SkincareAddiction for safe products and product warnings. They're incredibly helpful, and well-informed."

brownbeauty,2s537k,jingabobo,7,Mon Jan 12 06:27:55 2015 UTC,"Question--nude relative to natural lip color, or nude relative to surrounding face skin?"
brownbeauty,2s537k,multirachael,5,Mon Jan 12 13:33:13 2015 UTC,"Hmm interesting point actually, I'd say nude relative to your skin tone, basically a neutral range of shades that do not add additional colors like pink/red/purple to your lips. I think MLBB colors might be more colorful to be called nude in some cases as most of us have pigmented lips.  Something in the vicinity of this and this"
brownbeauty,2s537k,multirachael,2,Mon Jan 12 14:08:00 2015 UTC,"Gotcha; thanks for the clarification! Also, does it have to be a single-product application? Or does a liner + lipstick + gloss count? Bonus points for single product?"
brownbeauty,2s537k,melloniel,3,Mon Jan 12 21:50:37 2015 UTC,Oh no bar on 'making it work' if a particular lip liner works well as a nude color with shimmery gloss on go for it!!

brownbeauty,2s50bj,faith_trustpixiedust,2,Mon Jan 12 06:01:32 2015 UTC,Yep! I used a black liner for all of these. Just line your lips than add like a triangle shape in the corners like this < >. Put the shade on the center and your done.

Anywho I'm mad bored at home and figured I would upload some pics showing the difference that wearing brown lip liner can make.

brownbeauty,2s54pg,purplepingu,5,Mon Jan 12 06:54:31 2015 UTC,"Your best bet is to use a darker lip liner underneath to make the shade more wearable for you. So, for the pink, try something like MAC Beet lip liner with it. As for the peach, I'd suggest a tawny colour, maybe even MAC Mahogany!"

brownbeauty,2s2zke,applesandcherry,2,Mon Jan 12 07:35:51 2015 UTC,I agree about nude/champagne. I barely used to use them but the rest of the palette is gorgeous and i love the quality. I'm making myself use up the lorac pro palette this year and have found myself enhoying it more and more everyday. Try doing the a halo eye using one of thw darker shades and nude or champagne. Works pretty nicely.
brownbeauty,2s0wcc,applesandcherry,3,Sun Jan 11 02:47:06 2015 UTC,Ouch that's a really light swatch! But thanks for the review.
brownbeauty,2s0wcc,beautylit,3,Sun Jan 11 12:14:24 2015 UTC,"This was really great, helpful and thorough. Very deceiving (based on similar packaging) that it was so light but I really do like it for that Kim K look on you. Maybe it would be better with a banana powder to set?    As an aside, have you tried orange concealer? It's pretty popular among black women but I've been wanting to see how it looks on South Asians. I think it would work really well with your complexion, if your concern in undereye darkness."
brownbeauty,2s0wcc,Anne_of_Avonlea,2,Sun Jan 11 15:59:40 2015 UTC,"Yes I have used orange concealer,actually I have NYX's right now but it creases immediately on me. :/ I'm trying to find an inexpensive one that wouldn't do that.  Banana is a little too light for my complexion so I use Topaz which looks more natural and not as stark. I have another yellow-tinted translucent powder and I don't like the way it looks sometimes tbh. I only use it to lighten a concealer that may be a touch dark for me."
brownbeauty,2s0wcc,ElizadeathTaylor,3,Mon Jan 12 20:01:20 2015 UTC,"Every drugstore concealer I've tried ends up being way lighter than the package makes it look. Thanks for swatching these, I've been eyeing them."
brownbeauty,2s0wcc,frumperbell,2,Mon Jan 12 06:12:42 2015 UTC,"Aww.  I've been eyeing that concealer up the past few times I hit my CVS.  Now I'm glad I skipped it.  Even as a highlight, that swatch would be way too light on me.  On the bright side though, it looks like Fit Me would work really well... assuming I can ever find it.  Any rate, thanks for posting this!"
brownbeauty,2s0wcc,meowmeowcatcat,3,Sun Jan 11 14:35:21 2015 UTC,Fit Me is great and surprisingly has a good formula for a drugstore concealer. It's liquid-y enough to be used on dry eyebags as well. :)

brownbeauty,2rpdrq,5upern0v4,1 point,Thu Jan 8 03:28:13 2015 UTC,You found the BITE lipstick to be more sheer than the Buxom gloss? Or sheerest among the lipsticks? And I like that I can tell only from a lip swatch that Technopagan is gorgeous on you. Have you actually worn it out during the day/night event? I'd be terrified of it smudging and looking like Calypso from Pirates of the Caribbean.
brownbeauty,2rpdrq,Anne_of_Avonlea,1 point,Thu Jan 8 04:42:13 2015 UTC,"Yes sorry I meant that the Bite lipstick was the sheerest among the lipsticks. Thanks for pointing that out, I'll correct it on my blog :) I'm going to be honest I wore it out ONCE when I went to a haunted house so it was dark and it fit with the theme haha..."
brownbeauty,2rpdrq,purplepingu,1 point,Thu Jan 8 04:49:03 2015 UTC,"Awesome blog post! Seeing technopagan on you made me want to get it, so I did. I'm a sucker for purples, and its an incredibly unique colour. When you apply it do you do a couple thin layers?"
brownbeauty,2rowpl,ElizadeathTaylor,2,Thu Jan 8 01:02:00 2015 UTC,There's also these new contour palettes from NYX.
brownbeauty,2rowpl,Anne_of_Avonlea,2,Thu Jan 8 01:03:17 2015 UTC,Merp a derp. Wish there were swatches on the skin but the KVD one looks promising. I'm working on a blog post for the ABH contour kit atm and I actually really like it for dark skin!

brownbeauty,2rmsy9,AkumaNoHana,3,Wed Jan 7 19:48:52 2015 UTC,You're welcome! I bought mine on drugstore.com. They have a decent selection of Black Radiance products.
brownbeauty,2rmsy9,EbonyLynn,2,Wed Jan 7 20:00:42 2015 UTC,I absolutely love these! Walgreens had them on sale at one point and I bought a couple to try them out.
brownbeauty,2rmsy9,cautionyellow,2,Wed Jan 7 20:42:12 2015 UTC,i have the color nude and i don't like it....it's very oily. i actually think it's quite sticky.  i also hate the taste of it. it feels too chemically?   none else?
brownbeauty,2rmsy9,seirianstar,2,Wed Jan 7 22:13:20 2015 UTC,These are awesome! And they're sold at the drugstore! Thanks for sharing. I've been wanting a lipstick/lip gloss combo that matched. I had no idea these existed.
brownbeauty,2rmsy9,hernmari,2,Thu Jan 8 09:03:17 2015 UTC,"Swatched on fair skin, but I thought you all might like to see these shades. And I'd like to emphasize that the formulas are AWESOME. The balms are CRAZY smooth and the glosses are nice. Full review here."
brownbeauty,2rkl0y,cali5795,4,Wed Jan 7 00:04:51 2015 UTC,I like the top right.

brownbeauty,2rlnzt,cautionyellow,3,Wed Jan 7 05:45:57 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for full coverage you should try the the MAC Studio Finish concealer. I used it all throughout high school and college and it served me well. These days I've switched to medium-full coverage foundations so I don't use concealer all that much, but MAC is a good place to start. It costs around $20 and lasts forever."
brownbeauty,2rlnzt,soopaaflii,2,Thu Jan 8 05:48:59 2015 UTC,"I've tried more than a few.   MUFE Full Cover Concealer: Very good shade range and coverage, but broke me out. KvD Tattoo Concealer: Same as MUFE BareMinerals Correcting Concealer SPF20: Works really well and great shade range NYX Above & Beyond Concealer: Good stuff, great price, but only runs up to about NW45/NC50.  Orange (which is only available online for some stupid reason) is a great color corrector over hyper pigmentation. LA Girl Pro Concealer: My current HG.  Works as good as the mid-end concealers I tried for a fraction of the cost.  Amazing shade range, but it can be hard to find.  If your local independent beauty stores don't have it, you can buy it at drugstore.com or Amazon (but don't buy from any sellers that list it for more than $3/bottle.)   HTH"
brownbeauty,2rlnzt,frumperbell,2,Wed Jan 7 13:01:43 2015 UTC,"I think NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer is really great thus far. The color selection is a little bit difficult to deal with though, so I've been mixing Custard and Caramel together to get my custom color that'll match my foundation. I'm definitely towards the middle with my skin tone so those with a deeper tone than mine will have a harder time finding their match.   I also find that the L'Oreal True Match Concealer is pretty good - not necessarily my go to but it does have very good coverage."
brownbeauty,2ril29,CajunTaco,3,Tue Jan 6 14:29:27 2015 UTC,A good way to use the bright colors you have but make them look more muted is by using a brown lipliner. I really like wet n wild chestnut. It looks good by itself too.
brownbeauty,2ril29,cautionyellow,3,Tue Jan 6 17:11:26 2015 UTC,"I use brown versions of nudes and pinks. For example, Laura Mercier's Damask is a nice pink on my two-toned NC-42 lips."
brownbeauty,2ril29,motor_mouth,2,Tue Jan 6 17:41:25 2015 UTC,Nudes and (bright) light pinks I can't pull off without looking like a stripper. The closest I've come to those colors is Stila All Day Stay Liquid Lipstick in Bellisima (I think... ). It's a great BLBB
brownbeauty,2ril29,smm2194,2,Tue Jan 6 17:53:21 2015 UTC,"Its not Bellisima actually, it's Patina, but I can't figure out how to edit on mobile (Reddit sync app)"
brownbeauty,2ril29,smm2194,2,Tue Jan 6 17:54:59 2015 UTC,Maybelline's Untainted Spice is a great color for WOC. You may still need to use brown lipliner to contour your lips with it (I do) but it's a lovely color.  Tbh I have given up on nudes and pinks and just wear reds and purples everywhere.
brownbeauty,2ril29,applesandcherry,1 point,Tue Jan 6 19:55:23 2015 UTC,I've never liked the look of purple on me and I'm a nude type wearer. Glosses I use just give a hint of nude. This is me branching out from Chapstick and lipgloss.
brownbeauty,2ril29,real-rainicorn,2,Tue Jan 6 20:30:01 2015 UTC,Etude house cherry tint! First sheer but buildable pink that looks good on me
brownbeauty,2ril29,Laylatae,2,Tue Jan 6 22:32:56 2015 UTC,"My favourite nude is MAC's Taupe and my favourite pink(ish) is Chanel's no 34 La Raffinee, both are matte lipsticks.  I pair them both with MAC's lipliner in Spice.    I feel that they look best when I put a little bit of foundation over my lips, but that's mostly because my upper lip is darker so the foundation evens things out."
brownbeauty,2ril29,beautylit,1 point,Tue Jan 6 22:45:10 2015 UTC,I've just read about putting foundation on your lips. I'll give that a try.
brownbeauty,2ril29,moonjongup,2,Wed Jan 7 10:37:52 2015 UTC,I am NC50ish (nars macao) My nudes I really like are Milani Teddy Bare and Mac Touch. teddy bare is the lighter of the two. I got a mini of Kat Von D Lolita and I really like it as a nudey pink!
brownbeauty,2ril29,Anne_of_Avonlea,1 point,Wed Jan 7 02:56:54 2015 UTC,NC40 - My favorite nudes are the ones that are a bit rosier. MAC Syrup and Bite Beauty Date are two of my favorites thus far. I also like Maybelline Color Sensational Totally Toffee (light brown nude) and I make it a bit pinker using a NYX gloss (Angel Food Cake namely).
brownbeauty,2ril29,MintyLotus,1 point,Wed Jan 7 18:27:32 2015 UTC,BITE Rhubarb and Maybelline 155 Party Pink are my go-to (not hot) pinks. I have a couple brown nudes from MAC but t always end up wearing pink for a daily look because the formula is way more comfortable.
brownbeauty,2ril29,Brompton_Cocktail,1 point,Thu Jan 8 04:23:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've given up wearing anything lighter than my face lol. Honestly to just have to look for darker, maybe more mauve pinks/nudes"
brownbeauty,2ri8ae,deadcutie,30,Tue Jan 6 11:39:37 2015 UTC,"I think there are times when it's totally well meaning, because this is an awesome sub and you're almost guaranteed to get helpful answers here.   Good example, ""Your eyeshadow blending is__, maybe try__instead. X and Y company have a ton of foundation shades available, also /r/brownbeauty is another helpful sub!""  On the other hand I think it's really dismissive when they offer absolutely no help aside from redirecting you here.   Bad example: ""Have you tried /r/brownbeauty?"" when you've simply posted a picture of your makeup asking for CC or whatever.   I think it would be beneficial for both communities, if makeupaddiction made some kind of collaborative effort with brownbeauty, because I would hate if suggesting this sub to users became a taboo over there. Makeupaddiction could definitely use some kind of change over there regarding how different skin colors and racial issues (Revlon CEO discussion anyone?) are approached.  Just my two cents on the subject, but I'm always open to discussion :)"
brownbeauty,2ri8ae,ElizadeathTaylor,3,Tue Jan 6 20:43:47 2015 UTC,Revlon CEO discussion?! goes hunting
brownbeauty,2ri8ae,Anne_of_Avonlea,16,Thu Jan 8 04:20:27 2015 UTC,They want upvotes/karma but don't know how to answer our questions.
brownbeauty,2ri8ae,applesandcherry,7,Tue Jan 6 19:53:25 2015 UTC,I see that soooo much. But at least here it's easier to get a realistic idea of what colors I might actually like on my skin.
brownbeauty,2ri8ae,Aaaandiiii,9,Tue Jan 6 22:15:56 2015 UTC,"Well, you have to assume that the majority of the active posters on MUA have light complexions. There is advice they can give on techniques, brushes, or examples of certain look ideas, but...why would they necessarily know anything about darker complexions??  Barring those professional makeup artist, the majority of people only do makeup on themselves and sometimes friends or family for fun. And hell, if you live in the bum fuck Midwest (like me), it's completely possible that some pro's haven't worked with that skin color. I took my cousin into a MAC counter and the sales lady was SO excited. She said, 'I always dreamed for the day when an NW55 girl would come in. You have some of the most gorgeous complexions!'   I have a niece who is white, extremely pale with red hair and freckles, and I have a cousin (mentioned) who wears some of the deepest MAC shades available, and wears her hair natural. Why they think I can give them suggestions is beyond me. I don't necessarily swatch things and think, how would this look on Ally or Sam. It's all me girl, so I can really only give you a recap of my experiences. I might think a certain lipstick and eye combo would be perfect for you, but, in my ignorance, not realize that, due to lack of pigmentation in the product and your skin tone, they might look ashy or not even show up.   But, I'm also saying I'm a complete supporter for brown skinned girls posting on MUA,  and always give props when I see one. We do have to work harder in this industry than others do--both the models and those buying. I don't think it's so much 'go where you belong' or even them just trying to get up votes. They're saying, 'Hey, try here too!'--at least they're responding and trying to be helpful.   At the end of the day, whether the poster has hooded lids, or freckles, or a complexion darker and lighter than mine, if I like it, I'll take a look and maybe even see how I can get the same looks with colors that work for my skin tone. That's what us makeup dolls do dahhling. We grow, adapt, make stupid mistakes and fabulous errors.  Tl; dr: don't blame them if they don't have any advice for you, but still make a helpful suggestion. It's what I'd do if I saw a pale girl post on this sub looking for a bronzer. 'Honey, I love the look! No idea of which bronzer you should go for, but I know XYZ had a similar skintone, check her YT!'"
brownbeauty,2ri8ae,MixxedOpinion,4,Tue Jan 6 23:06:21 2015 UTC,"Just look at the front page of this sub..! It's full of useful, meaningful & lovely posts from all shades of brown beauties! If you ever need any real help you will get it here for sure whereas on MUA the majority of the demographic is fair skinned and are probably clueless about the shades/colors appropriate for us.  However technique & overall CC is universal and you can get that in any sub regardless of skin color."

brownbeauty,2rbdra,L7weenie1,2,Sun Jan 4 17:59:43 2015 UTC,I love COVERfx Total Cover Cream foundation as a concealer over pigmentation or spots. Then I like to top it with NARS Tinted moisturizer all over. I usually dust Chanel's Loose Powder over top and it looks like I'm not wearing a lick of makeup while still achieving full coverage.
brownbeauty,2rbdra,thefriendlypickle,2,Sun Jan 4 21:54:04 2015 UTC,"Nars tinted moisturizer (Groenland) with Nars radiant creamy concealer (a shade lighter for under-eyes and dark spots) is perfect ""no-makeup"" makeup for me. I'll put it over a primer and it's the simplest routine I have. Then I'll throw on any nude lip or MLBB shade I have.   I do recommend the concealer."
brownbeauty,2rbdra,animousity692,1 point,Tue Jan 6 03:10:52 2015 UTC,Here's mine in the order I put them in:   (optional) Foundation: L'Oreal Magic Nude - just a light layer all over. I'm the darkest color. Concealer: Maybelline Fit Me concealer (forgot the shade) OR LA Girl Pro concealer in Fawn (more yellow) or Toffee (more pink) -- I only put concealer underneath my eyes and dot my forehead/nose/chin to make everything look even and bright. Eyeliner: Physician's Formula liquid eyeliner (the skinnier one) in Ultra Black -- great for making super thin lines or cat eyes when I feel like being obvious with wearing makeup lol. Mascara: At the moment -- L'Oreal Carbon Black Voluminous. It's okay but I can't wait to try something new that isn't flaky. Powder: Ben Nye Loose Powder in Topaz -- just stamped underneath my eyes Lips: Any tinted lip balm. I usually use Burt's Bees in Red Dahlia or blot a burgandy or plum lipstick to look more like a stain.

brownbeauty,2r42i1,MintyLotus,3,Fri Jan 2 18:08:20 2015 UTC,"ohhhh thanks.  My eyebrows are naturally black, but my head hair is like.. almost black -- you can see hints of brown at the ends when the sun hits it just right. Also, my 2013 Summer at-home ombre disaster is finally almost all grown out/cut off.  Right now I'm using the e.l.f. eyebrow kit in Dark but i only got that so i could practice with ""goo"" for my brows (as opposed to pencil) before spending the money on Dipbrow. The color smudge i saw of the ebony Dipbrow looked pretty similar to the e.l.f. color that works for me, so i really hope the Dipbrow doesn't end up being too dark. I've heard a lot of people say that just applying it with a light hand will help.  I went ahead and got the Anastasia #12 brush since everyone rants and raves about it.  I guess once it arrives next week I'll have to to a B&A with the e.l.f. and the dipbrow so we can see what all the fuss is about."
brownbeauty,2r42i1,sweetheart294,2,Fri Jan 2 18:46:09 2015 UTC,Depends on your hair/skin. I'm about an NC 37-40 but I have very dark hair and I use Ebony.

brownbeauty,2r42i1,Thunderstormer,2,Fri Jan 2 20:57:35 2015 UTC,"I bought Ebony after swatching it, Chocolate, and Dark Brown.   Dark Brown was way too light and Chocolate was too warm."

I would definitely say don't get ebony since you are lighter than nw47 ish I think the black would be too harsh."

brownbeauty,2r42i1,kubot,2,Fri Jan 2 17:43:16 2015 UTC,"on desktop, there's a sidebar over on the right. Under where it says Submit a new link or post, there's a little checkbox that says ""show my flair on this subreddit"" -- click on edit next to your username and just put in whatever you want.  I chose NC42/mixed because i think it helps give people an idea of what kind of skin i have and how colors will look on them if they have similar coloring."
brownbeauty,2r42i1,libelula88,2,Fri Jan 2 17:55:54 2015 UTC,"the ebony isn't black, it's a dark brown -- the closest thing they had to black was Granite, which i would agree would be too dark for me.  I went ahead and ordered the ebony. If it ends up being too dark, i'll either send it back and order the dark brown, or I'll gift it to someone with darker brows than me."
brownbeauty,2r270q,CicelyTyson,19,Fri Jan 2 02:22:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if this is allowed here, but since Revlon is such a huge drug store brand, I figured this lawsuit would be interesting to discuss among beauty lovers.  This is enough to give me pause and take my business elsewhere. I stopped buying Revlon foundation a while ago because they only offered two darker shades and neither matched my skin tone. I have purchased Revlon lipsticks recently, but they discontinued my favourite colour, Sultry Sable, which was essentially a nude for NW50 women.   It doesn't come as a surprise that the CEO of a huge beauty brand is racist. I feel like most are when we consider how little they care about creating products for darker skinned ladies. Still, seeing comments like this is a reminder that I need to be more conscious of which brands to support."
brownbeauty,2r270q,__Shadynasty_,12,Fri Jan 2 02:28:15 2015 UTC,"At most I only buy eye liner from them. But having grown up around middle and upper class business men it's my firm belief that if I tried to make my dollar navigate around every business with stupid/racist /homophobic leadership then I wouldn't have very many products in my life.  A lot of management types have lived charmed lives and have ignorant views,this is a bigger problem that needs a bigger solution."
brownbeauty,2r270q,veganmua,8,Fri Jan 2 15:57:24 2015 UTC,"Wow. I don't buy from them since they started testing on animals, but this is shocking. Very interested to see whether the allegations are proven."
brownbeauty,2r270q,supcaci,12,Fri Jan 2 10:46:46 2015 UTC,"Because this is a lawsuit that comes on the heels of a termination, it's hard to know how much credence to give these allegations. I'm going to keep tabs on the story, though. Definitely plausible that the dude is a giant asshole. Thanks for sharing!"
brownbeauty,2r270q,KelsayLilay,3,Fri Jan 2 02:54:53 2015 UTC,"I was saddened when I read through the details of the allegations today. I won't be buying their products until the whole case is over. Even if it turns out that these are accusations that were made out of spite, I think that it is worth waiting to see how this plays out. In the meantime, I'll be giving other companies my business."

brownbeauty,2r270q,jingabobo,2,Mon Jan 5 03:21:06 2015 UTC,I would expect this type of disgusting 'I can say & do what I want' attitude from most top execs in the world. Money & power do corrupt most minds.   Only a select few are shining exemptions but we won't usually hear about them.

I also used to use ELF gel eye liner but found it smudging after a few hours. Do you have that problem? I've switched to Loreal infallible gel liner but I'm still searching for the perfect long lasting liner..

I also like Bobbi Brown Creamy Matte lipsticks (Red Carpet is a true red). The Bite Beauty matte lip colors are great  (Fraise is a good red).  For a drugstore option, I really like the new Maybelline Creamy Mattes! The Siren In Scarlet is a great red. The NYx mattes are also good (I'd recommend Alabama, Perfect Red or Pure Red, depending on how bright you want your red) and Merlot is a great deeper red that looks good on everyone. (Keep in mind that the NYX and Maybelline aren't true mattes, more demi mattes, but they're comfortable to wear).  Of course, MAC has several reds that are great: Ruby Woo, Russian Red, MAC Red, Diva, Chili and Dubonnet.   Hope this helps! :)"

brownbeauty,2qqycf,your-beast-of-burden,2,Tue Dec 30 00:14:25 2014 UTC,My personal favorite is Still Liquid Lipstick in Fiery. It's $22 and a little goes a long way and it's very long lasting.
brownbeauty,2qqycf,your-beast-of-burden,2,Tue Dec 30 00:05:27 2014 UTC,"I've had the same struggle with finding a good red matte. I received Limecrime's velvetine in Red Velvet this Christmas and it is an absolute dream. I am obsessed with the color. It dries absolutely matte and the color is so rich and just a real red red. I like that I can wear it bright or that with a darker lip pencil underneath it still looks just as good.I couldn't recommend it enough. If you want a picture, just pm me. I've been wearing it all day and it still looks as good now as when I first applied it 7 hours ago. I think i retouched it slightly after lunch."
brownbeauty,2qqycf,bloopbloop123,1 point,Tue Dec 30 02:48:07 2014 UTC,I was considering this too but the only tough part about lime crime products is that they're not sold in a lot of stores.
brownbeauty,2qqycf,animejunkytri,2,Tue Dec 30 16:16:12 2014 UTC,"I think that's what always stopped me from buying them. I like to try lipsticks on first before purchasing. But since I received both Salem and red velvet, I wish I had just bit the bullet and ordered them both sooner. They are really great mattes and the colors are so flattering."
brownbeauty,2qqycf,creamcheesefiasco,2,Tue Dec 30 17:19:02 2014 UTC,My personal favorite is NARS Fire Down the Below. It's a perfect matte brick red with no blue tones in it.

It's subdued enough to not attract too much attention, but it's definitely flattering!"
brownbeauty,2qov7e,MyLittleLabMonkey,1 point,Tue Dec 30 01:20:57 2014 UTC,"Good to know and glad you are loving it :) I am interested in this year's LE Pantone collection exactly because of the neutral-with-a-twist potential.   I was thinking of this lip layering collection, but wan't sure of the variance of the color range. Do you think some of these colors are redundant? For example, Canyon Clay shows up so similar to Marsala."
brownbeauty,2qov7e,c3bysparrow,2,Tue Dec 30 01:26:21 2014 UTC,"They are different, either in terms of shades of the same color (i.e lighter/darker) or undertones. for example, Canyon Clay is warmer than Marsala (which is a tand pinker). Even on the lips, there's a difference, albeit a minute one - if you wore, say, Marsala on the upper lip and Canyon Clay on the lower, you would be able to make out a difference (at least, that's how it is on me, and I have medium pigmented lips)."

Smoking hot pink, mochalicious, wine room, spiked with rum, and mauve outta here are good beginner type colors. Once you feel more comfy being brighter, cherry picking is amazing. Nice fuschia red. And stoplight red is very nice too."

brownbeauty,2qhbsx,cat_scratches,3,Fri Dec 26 22:32:27 2014 UTC,How do you think the MUFE shadows compare to LORAC shadows? Temptalia makes it sound like when you use the new MUFE shadows then angels will come down from heaven and kiss your eyelids. However from your swatches they look like similar quality. Do you think the MUFE palette is worth having for someone who already owns similar colors from LORAC and Urban Decay?
brownbeauty,2qhbsx,SexyScientistGirl,2,Sat Dec 27 07:03:55 2014 UTC,"Temptalia makes it sound like when you use the new MUFE shadows then angels will come down from heaven and kiss your eyelids.   LOL! I don't know about that but I was pretty wow-ed.  I would say they're not as pigmented/blendable as the Lorac Pro, but pretty on par with the shimmery shades in Unzipped.  I haven't played around with it too much in comparison with Urban Decay, but I think they might be a little smoother than my Naked 1.  If you want, I can do comparison swatches."

I'm still shopping around for an HG, but every high end concealer I've tried so far either works just as well, or breaks me out.  Either way, I keep coming back. CoverGirl Foundations - Yeah.  The Queen 3 in 1 in Golden Honey is my new HG.  It matches me exactly, undertones and all.  And then CG went and reformulated their TruBlend line and came out with a butt load of shades.  I think the only other line that has that much variety is L'Oreal's True Match.   Black Violet Detangler Mist - I'd post a link, but she's closed until Jan 1.  This stuff is magic.  Before I was using the Jane Carter Solution on my hair, but it always left a greasy film if I used it straight out of the bottle.  I eneded spraying a tiny amount in a spray bottle of water as a work around.  Then I found Black Violet.  It's works straight out of the bottle and leaves my hair smelling amazing without a gross greasy film.   Sleek Contour Kit in Dark - Finally, a matte bronzer dark enough to actually work on my skin.   Black Opal Invisible Oil Blocking Powder - Finally, I found a translucent powder that doesn't leave me ashy.  It does come in pressed form, but I have it loose.  Works great under foundation a la the Goss Method or over to set everything and help me stay matte.   Misses   MUFE Full Cover & Kat Von D Tattoo Concealers - After reading all the raves for it, I wanted this to work so badly.  Of course they broke me out.  Horribly. They're Real Push Up Liner - It works great when you can get it to work, but shit's too finicky for me to want to bother with it. Anastasia Dip Brow - Yes, I said it.  I picked it up after returning the KvD concealer.  It is lovely, but again it's so finicky to get it right and it takes so long, I can never be bothered to use it."
brownbeauty,2qfwqn,soopaaflii,3,Fri Dec 26 12:54:07 2014 UTC,Where can you purchase LA Girl? I've been eyeing the Nars creamy concealer for a while but I have no problem with buying a cheaper product that works just as well or better!
brownbeauty,2qfwqn,soopaaflii,2,Fri Dec 26 22:11:57 2014 UTC,"The link I posted will take you to drugstore.com who carries them.   Amazon also does, but you have to watch out for douchey price gougers: if the price is more than $3/tube, don't buy from that seller.     If you're looking for a NARS dupe,  Maybelline Fit Me is a good one.   I have yet to try it (I can never find my shade) but there was a post on MUA earlier this year where the OP did a head to head and declared them pretty damn close."
brownbeauty,2qfwqn,soopaaflii,1 point,Fri Dec 26 22:58:47 2014 UTC,"Okay, thanks! I've never seen this in stores.   I've actually tried Fit Me twice and was none too impressed. It was mostly because there weren't any shades that fit me (ha. ha.). Funny enough I went to Sephora yesterday and tested out the NARS concealer and really liked it! I'm putting it on my wish list."
brownbeauty,2qfwqn,youaintbad,1 point,Sat Dec 27 18:44:50 2014 UTC,I made the same joke when the foundation turned out to be a dud for me. :p  I don't get why there's so few shades of the concealer when there's such a good range on the foundation.    Which shade of the NARS matched you?
brownbeauty,2qfwqn,Memetheslayer,1 point,Sat Dec 27 18:55:55 2014 UTC,I was matched with the Caramel concealer. I also tried out the Bobbi Brown stick concealer and my shade was #6.
brownbeauty,2qfwqn,fb0mbb,1 point,Sat Dec 27 21:09:41 2014 UTC,I bought the Nars concealer in caramel a few months ago and I love it. It's a little dark on me right now since I tend to get lighter in the winter. I'm thinking about getting another one in a lighter shade to use for now. It's pricey but it's probably the best concealer I've used formula wise.
brownbeauty,2qfwqn,fb0mbb,1 point,Mon Dec 29 05:14:31 2014 UTC,I personally think the la girl concealer makes more sense. The nars has a superior formula. But I don't think it's a game changer. I also would say it depends on how u wanna use it. LA girls is great for Highlight. Super blendable.
brownbeauty,2qfwqn,Memetheslayer,2,Wed Dec 31 00:19:14 2014 UTC,"Really? My sleek contour kit was a miss for me. Maybe it's my brushes or technique, but It never comes out the way I expect"

Finally a natural looking brow product that was dark enough without looking too brown/too warm! Dear makeup comapnies: some of us actually do have jet black eyebrow hairs! Stila In the Garden palette. I love all the colours. They compliment my olive skin + brown eyes very nicely. It's such a versatile palette too. Beauty Blender knock-off sponges. These totally changed the way I applied my foundation. I love the lightweight and natural look they give. L'Oreal Miss Manga mascara. I love how voluminous and long this mascara make my lashes and I like the traditional bristle brush. I have noticed that many mascaras now are switching to the rubbery brush, which is a no-no for me since I have a latex allergy. I was getting irritation from a lot of mascaras and finally figured out that I need a traditional bristle brush or else I'll get a reaction!   Misses:   Maybelline FitMe foundation. I wanted this foundation to work. I bought three bottles and none of them worked for me in the right shade. They have so many shades but not one that suited me. I'm using up my last two bottles by mixing them together but I will probably not re-purchase. It's a pity because I like the coverage and finish of the foundation.  Any mascaras with a rubbery or plastic brush, like Lash Blast or the Butterfly Effect.   To try:  I want to try Hourglass foundation since all of you lovely ladies seem to be having luck with finding a right shade!"
brownbeauty,2qfwqn,MintyLotus,2,Fri Dec 26 15:18:11 2014 UTC,"I should have put a BB Dupe on my list.  It really does make a huge difference, especially with stiffer foundations like ColorStay."

Estee Lauder DoubleWear in 5W1, matches enough of my face (I have a very dappled face) and just looks beautiful, wears well.  Illamasqua HydraVeil - I was using Porefessional, I'll never go back!!! This sinks in and just plumps up your skin and makes you look more alive instantly and is fantastic under foundation, usually foundation makes me break out but nup, this stuff has stopped that happening.  Revlon Matte Balm in Standout - wears well, looks incredible, pops in photos, smells delicious."
brownbeauty,2qfwqn,MintyLotus,7,Sat Dec 27 06:59:17 2014 UTC,"Hits:  Dipbrow: I used to use black eyeshadow, which actually worked fine, but just didn't stay on well on certain parts of my brow, and could get powdery sometimes. I really like Dipbrow because it's easy for me to get anywhere from a BAM brow to a barely there, natural one, and I can get nice sharp lines consistently. It's also great for drawing on beards and tightlining. My only complaint is that in certain lights, it's a little too brown/warm.   Kat von D eyeshadows: her palettes are soooo great. Like my two go-to palettes are both from her.   Revlon Matte Balm in Shame and Sultry: love the formula, the ease of application, and the opacity and color.  Oil: dude. I should have started on oil much earlier. I'm reactive to a lot of cleansers and lotions and creams (on the face), but oil never makes my face burn or peel.   Misses: Confirm Covergirl 3 in 1: I'm pretty sad. I've heard such good things about it...but I tried it and my face started burning immediately. It had such a great consistency too :c  Foundation in general: everything is either too orange or too pink and ashy. I have some hope for MUFE HD153, and Estee Lauder Doublewear in 3w2 Cashew works sometimes, but right now my skin also just hates everything."

brownbeauty,2qfwqn,c3bysparrow,1 point,Fri Dec 26 23:00:43 2014 UTC,I love dipbrow but I have the same issue with the warm tones. I'm currently using it in chocolate because dark brown is too light and ebony is too dark for me. I want to get it in another shade but I don't know which one to get.
brownbeauty,2qfwqn,c3bysparrow,1 point,Sat Dec 27 06:55:31 2014 UTC,Have you tried using the lighter one near the beginning of your brows and the darker one towards the end?

It makes my lashes look long and fabulous! Funny enough, I ran out and started using my Maybelline Rocket mascara instead, and I like it a lot too.   NYX Soft Matte lip cream - I have San Paulo and Amsterdam and I wear them interchangeably all the time. They are very pigmented and last a very long time. Amsterdam is my favorite red lip color hands down.   Rommel Stay Matte Powder - my oily skin's hero. I love this powder so much!   Revlon Colorstay liquid liner - my preciousssss  Naked 1 Palette - okay I know a lot of people are ambivalent about this palette, but I love it! I wear half baked and smog almost every day.   Misses:  All other powders. I've used the IT Cosmetics powder and Too Faced Prime and Poreless loose powder but they did nothing for me. I want to return the TF powder but I threw away the receipt :(  Benefit Porefessional Primer - I have a love/hate relationship with Benefit. Some of the products are good and some are not. This is one of the bad. This primer did nothing for me and did not cover my giant pores as promised :(   Tarte foundation - it was so thick and cakey. Not a terrible foundation at all but just not for me. My sister loves it.   Revlon Colorburst balm/stain thing - it was laughable how horrible this looked on me and how splotchy it applied.   The Eh:  Smashbox primer - eh. It is okay but not that great since its hailed as one of the first/best primers ever. Would not repurchase but I don't hate it."

brownbeauty,2q88yo,MyLittleLabMonkey,3,Wed Dec 24 00:25:20 2014 UTC,The packaging alone is so gorgeous and everything in your haul looks amazing. Can't wait to see it on your face!
brownbeauty,2q88yo,moonjongup,3,Wed Dec 24 06:41:49 2014 UTC,"A while ago, Kiko had a sale online, and I thought it was a great time to try out some of their products. Unfortunately, they don't ship to the US (BOO KIKO!!) so I asked /u/sea-weed for help. She was so, so very kind and placed the order for me, and shipped it over [as a side note, she wrapped everything with bubble wrap, and sent it with the cutest note ever!]  I only got the package today, so I haven't been able to play with them much but here are my first impressions:  Eyeshadow Sticks  My goodness, these glide on like butter! Extremely pigmented. Takes a bit to set, but once they do, they DO NOT BUDGE. I had to use two different makeup removers to get the swatches off my hand! Very impressive and I already want more.  Color Fever Eyeshadow Palette  These palettes are wonderful! The shadows are soft, smooth, and very pigmented (I'm seeing a recurring theme here). I really like the shades, although Unexpected Rosy Taupe was not rosy at all, and more taupey! Also there were no matte shades, only shimmers and glittery shades, so if those aren't your thing, you might not like these.  Water Eyeshadows  My new loves. SO FRIKKIN PIGMENTED. They're lovely, lovely, lovely shimmery shades, and they are so beautiful, and just.. ugh, I want them all.  Lipsticks  Velvet Mats - not true mattes, more demi mattes. They seemed to drag on my skin a little bit, but I haven't tried them on my lips yet. They do leave a stain behind (I took off the swatches with my bioderma, and it left a stain behind).  Luscious Cream - smooth and creamy. I really like this formula and will most probably get more, just because of the formula. These also leave behind a stain.  Ace Of Diamond lipstick - these are supposed to be demi mattes, and I think that's accurate. They're a little more dry than the Velvet mattes, but still go on a little more smooth than the velvet mats. These also leave behind a stain.   Overall - Kiko is definitely one of the brands I'll be purchasing again from. I was impressed with every single thing I bought, and there was nothing that made me go ""oh, I wish I hadn't bought this/spent money on this"". Highly recommend giving them a try!"
brownbeauty,2q88yo,anne_sophie,3,Wed Dec 24 00:25:28 2014 UTC,These look amazing. Especially the shadow sticks which I know come highly recommended by Lisa Eldridge. I can't get over the pigmentation of the the water eyeshadows. Looks like they would show up on a variety of skin tones without looking chalky.
brownbeauty,2q88yo,anne_sophie,3,Wed Dec 24 03:51:49 2014 UTC,"I was really stunned at the pigmentation. I had expectations, sure, but they weren't very high, and these blew it out of the park. Even the texture of the shadows was really good - very finely milled (I can see them being a little on the powdery side) but given how nicely these apply, I can forgive that."
brownbeauty,2q7xcv,Anne_of_Avonlea,1 point,Tue Dec 23 22:39:56 2014 UTC,"Also, if anyone wants to critique this post/has some of these colours please go ahead!

brownbeauty,2q6hxm,sparklingly,7,Tue Dec 23 15:19:52 2014 UTC,I very very frequently use eye shadows to contour. I'm currently quite happy with the Rainforest After Dark palette's Don't Turn A-Brown (Tarte)
brownbeauty,2q6hxm,smm2194,5,Tue Dec 23 17:10:40 2014 UTC,"I second this! It's so much easier to find eyeshadows with the right undertones. I personally need something with a more yellow, and most contour products pull too grey or red on me."
brownbeauty,2q6hxm,Brompton_Cocktail,6,Tue Dec 23 18:16:53 2014 UTC,I'm always suggesting this but definitely try out the sleek face form palette! It was made for women in color in mind and is definitely my HG Contour and highlight
brownbeauty,2q6hxm,BunBunRN,2,Tue Dec 23 18:59:53 2014 UTC,I have this! I just find it a little difficult to blend because of how bloody pigmented it is. I find it have to spend a little longer working with the product to make it look natural. I still use it sometimes if I'm putting more time into my makeup in the morning :) The highlight shade is absolutely gorgeous!

From what I've swatched it could be a good contender for the Hourglass ALP, but if someone owns both maybe you could let us know how they compare?   NYX Matte Lipstick in Eurotrash is an awesome nude, and the same in Sierra is a nice warm MLBB colour."

You could always seek out a sales associate with similar coloring/features as you.    Let them know you're looking to try out lip colors and make sure to give them information about what you're looking for (a bright red, a MLBB) and they can give you suggestions and sanitize the testers for you so you can try them on."
brownbeauty,2q76is,whythehecknot,1 point,Tue Dec 23 19:30:19 2014 UTC,"That's good to hear about you not having that experience. When I went to the Ulta in the same mall, the other ladies were a little chilly until I could locate a friendly WoC working there, so I was worried about that."
brownbeauty,2q76is,Brompton_Cocktail,4,Wed Dec 24 01:12:27 2014 UTC,"I can agree with your friend, ideally you should have an idea of what your color match would be in a brand. Sephora has this machine that tries to give you a 4 digit alphanumeric code (ex: 4Y08) by taking pictures of your forehead, cheeks and neck and trying to find your skintone based on this. Every time I've used it, it's given me the wrong color. If possible, try and pick out colors that may work for you and ask the sales associate to apply it on your face for you. Also other WOC sales associates are very helpful as well."
brownbeauty,2q76is,ritesofbeauty,1 point,Tue Dec 23 18:58:22 2014 UTC,"Thanks for this. My local Sephora is in an area that has quite a few minorities around, so I'm hoping that there will be WoC sales associates."
brownbeauty,2q76is,MintyLotus,3,Wed Dec 24 01:11:41 2014 UTC,"If there is a MAC counter nearby, that might be a good alternative to finding your colour match. Most of the MAC counters where I live are relatively diverse in terms of their staff, so I usually make a beeline towards any associate with a skin tone like mine and ask for help. Plus the MAC employees tend to be better trained than the sephora staff, in my experience."
brownbeauty,2q76is,MintyLotus,1 point,Tue Dec 23 23:04:37 2014 UTC,Hmm. Let me see if I can find out if there's a MAC counter in my area. Thank you! :D

I picked up this lip set and I'm really liking it! It's a great collection IMO for deeper skins - the shades all look fabulous against my NC42 skin. I haven't tested out wear time yet, but from the arm swatches, the deeper shades leave behind a stain.  The shades themselves are sheer, but can be built up. The swatches in the picture are of 3-4 passes each. It feels like a comfortable formula, but again, I'll have to test them fully to really comment on that."

Also since we're the same MAC shade (whoo NC50) I will suggest the one (I only have a sample at the moment or I'd send you some) I have which is the Laura Mercier High Coverage Concealer For Under Eye in #6. Its a little brighter than my skin tone since I also use it for under eye brightening. You use so little product per application, it's worth the $28 price tag. I have two samples and I haven't even made a dent in the first one. That's how LITTLE you use. Makeup Alley has reviews about it creasing like crazy and I attribute that to using too much since all the glowing reviews mention how little you're supposed to use."
brownbeauty,2q28g4,jingabobo,2,Mon Dec 22 13:24:39 2014 UTC,"I'd be down, but I seem to be much darker than a lot of the girls that post here... So I'm wondering if you would sample things I could use."

Why are there two or three categories for whiteness and only one for darkness? To make this legitimate you really do need more categories of darkness, as i am NC40-NC43 and definitely nowhere near the darkest out there. Its totally unfair to put everyone darker in one category as if there's not enormous diversity!"

They're very creamy and easy to work with! The packaging is a little strange... It's a click up tube and it goes into a little silicone nub instead of a brush... I like to wring the nub out on my hand and apply with a finger!
brownbeauty,2pzi8n,melonaz,2,Mon Dec 22 01:37:18 2014 UTC,Ooh I used to have one way back when  Good to know they have an orange one

brownbeauty,2pzi8n,applesandcherry,3,Sun Dec 21 17:49:18 2014 UTC,"Me neither :( I think it it way too thick to use on the under eye area. I know NYX makes an orange concealer specifically for dark undereye circles, so maybe try that? I currently use the Tarte marajuca ""creaseless"" concealer, but it creases like crazy for me."
brownbeauty,2pzi8n,melonaz,2,Mon Dec 22 01:26:22 2014 UTC,Yeah I'm experimenting with ways to cover it and so far the most effective is to give up and just wear glasses hahah
brownbeauty,2pzi8n,mcpagal,3,Mon Dec 22 12:07:50 2014 UTC,I KNOW I bought it hoping it would give me the look I wanted at a cheaper price point than a high-end corrector (no one else makes orange concealers at drugstore level). But... it creased within hours yet still looked cakey and dry. I still use it when I need to look nice and put it on my muzzle area (hyperpigmentation).
brownbeauty,2pzi8n,applesandcherry,2,Mon Dec 22 03:35:57 2014 UTC,Yeah I think you're right! I'm probably gonna repurpose it

brownbeauty,2pzi8n,lilylolalu,3,Sun Dec 21 21:56:30 2014 UTC,Did you try using a creamy eye cream just before applying your corrector / concealer? I've found that it helps a lot with evenly spreading corrector/concealers of thick consistency. Note that the eye cream has to be creamy and not liquid or gel like.
brownbeauty,2pzi8n,Jnnlopez,2,Sun Dec 21 20:50:14 2014 UTC,"So using the eye cream on my face, not just my eyes? I haven't tried that, but I do use primer before I put on my concealer."
brownbeauty,2pzi8n,Brompton_Cocktail,2,Mon Dec 22 01:29:18 2014 UTC,"oh no! Sorry I sounded so ambiguous!! I meant a creamy eye cream under eye. Basically, as a base for wherever you wanted to apply the corrector or concealer.   (Your concealing looks very effective and suggesting this only because you felt like your orange concealer was hard to spread.)"
brownbeauty,2pzi8n,LimeyTart,2,Mon Dec 22 07:20:27 2014 UTC,When I use Secret Camouflage the same way (the orangier side) I use a 217 brush (I have a bunch of copy cats too) I warm it up in my hand and then I only lightly buff it in where I need it

brownbeauty,2q1x65,frumperbell,2,Mon Dec 22 13:23:18 2014 UTC,Great! And Toast is what she used for regular concealing shade? Do you know what a good highlighting shade would be?
brownbeauty,2q1x65,frumperbell,1 point,Tue Dec 23 00:58:05 2014 UTC,"After looking at swatches, I'd guess Toffee would work as a highlight for you.

I remember this one thread months ago where a girl posted a FOTD with something like ""this lipstick on dark skin"" as the title and people were going up in arms about her putting the words ""dark skin"" in the title. They were like, ""why are you putting that there? what is the point? are you trying to make some sort of statement?"" People on there are insensitive and are the same types of people I've run into on other large subreddits that are quick to invalidate what you're saying/your experience by calling you a""SJW"" or ""pearl-clutcher."" In general, MUA is not nice and I am over it. And it's not even really an MUA problem, it's a reddit problem."

Like. Wut. I wanted to get angry and be a jerk because what does me not being able to get a freaking SAMPLE remotely close to my skin tone in something available to all purchasers have to do with you not being able to find foundation for your ""white painted"" skin, since that's what geisha's freaking did.  Both times I've posted my face I get the ""flawless"" skin comments. They dominate the threads. How about if my lip color is flattering or my blush is too light or too dark. I'm wearing foundation, it's supposed to look smooth. I like compliments as much as the next girl but the same thing over and over reminds me of a hive mind mentality.

I've been over there less and less and anymore, the only thing I look at is stickied threads like Simple Questions.  It's sad because MUA was the reason I started posting on reddit in the first place.  I've noticed in the year and a half I've been posting there, the focus has morphed from makeup technique (and bandwagon jumping) to Survival of the Prettiest - technique be damned (and bandwagon jumping).    It wouldn't be so bad, except that when WOC start talking about their issues, responses range from the oblivious (""Gosh I KNOW!  I'm super pale and have SUCH a hard time finding stuff to match.  Let me derail your thread and talk about meeeeeee!"") to down right hostile (""I don't get why you guys are complaining.  What do you want retailers/companies to do?  If they only worried about the fringe they'd be out of business because you're the minority and therefore don't buy as much"").  There are some posters who are interested in opening a dialog or trying to encourage inclusion, but the majority just get defensive.  And frankly, I don't want to have to be An Example or A Credit To My Race on here. I just want to fucking talk about makeup with cool people.  I can do that here, or at /r/Indiemakeupandmore.   And frankly it's sad that I even feel more welcome on /r/muacirclejerk.

brownbeauty,2pz6sw,frumperbell,29,Mon Dec 22 13:52:43 2014 UTC,"It's easy to feel ignored being a woc navigating the world of makeup. Having to go to the ends of the earth to find makeup, paying a ton to try each shade of every product/having to return them, not receiving any cc, having to ignore half the makeup aisle because it won't work on you, tinkering with products like a mad scientist until you can repurpose them in a way that works for you....it sucks. On prom I ended up looking like a gray ghost because my makeup artist didn't know how to deal with  my skin (and I paid about $100). But a lot of girls on MUA were saying they don't comment on woc posts because they genuinely don't know anything about makeup on woc. It's not that they don't want to help, it's that they can't. So I understand why woc are frustrated, but I also understand why MUA can't really help. I guess the easiest way to solve the problem would be to have a more active community here. And more woc makeup artists in general to represent us. In my Indian community makeup is a fairly recent trend. My mom never taught me about makeup (except for eyeliner, of course). Hopefully things will change for future generations. I'm fairly optimistic; I see more youtube channels and blogs popping up representing woc (like yours, which I love by the way!). Maybe we're looking at the wrong place when we look to MUA for help and progress regarding makeup and woc."
brownbeauty,2pz6sw,__Shadynasty_,30,Mon Dec 22 14:06:30 2014 UTC,"What I don't understand about people saying they don't know how to help WOC is like, you can still give CC on stuff like application, brow shape, blending, eyeliner technique, whether or not colors play together well on the eyes, whether or not you can see a highlight, if the lipstick clashes with the eyes, blush placement, etc. The only thing where you could claim 100% ignorance is foundation shades, and I don't see them providing CC on every white girl's foundation. I don't think anyone is asking every single NW15 MUA reader to be able to provide recommendations for blushes that might show well on NC40 skin or anything, but they all act like they're literally incapable of saying anything besides ""your skin is so beautiful!"" if the OP isn't white."

brownbeauty,2pz6sw,lilylolalu,18,Fri Dec 26 07:27:52 2014 UTC,"Exactly, and it's the most aggravating part of the whole thing for me.  It's like this pretend or good enough inclusiveness.

It sucks, but that's sorta just the reality of it."
brownbeauty,2pz6sw,missfreshface,21,Sun Dec 21 16:24:56 2014 UTC,"Everyone complains that WOC keep complaining that pale skin discussion dominates because THEY don't see it. It's there all the time most just don't even realize it.  There's been more WOC up voted recently and it's nice, but I also kind of get that people are just doing it for show. Most of the up voted looks are really simple and offer the OP no cc."
brownbeauty,2pz6sw,yougoglencocox,14,Sun Dec 21 21:30:14 2014 UTC,"I agree. It's like a ""LOOK HOW INCLUSIVE WE ARE."" Same thing happens to men and people in transition."
brownbeauty,2pz6sw,yogapantsareforever,32,Mon Dec 22 00:52:17 2014 UTC,"I'm a newbie over on MUA, and I just posted about how seeing remarks on ""You should go over to /r/BrownBeauty"" really makes me feel sad and unwelcome. And in my few days there, I've definitely still seen people going, ""Oh, I sympathize with what you are going through to find a MLBB for your skin tone. As a pale girl..."" but then has a list of lippies that works for her and obviously has a lot of other options presented to her."
brownbeauty,2pz6sw,KTTeal,29,Mon Dec 22 06:57:29 2014 UTC,"I've begun to see Brown Beauty the same way I see the Natural hair movement.  We have been in many ways excluded by companies and by beauty communities in general, and now it's time for us to make our own exclusive communities to suit our needs, without allowing them to enter our space and derail the conversation."
brownbeauty,2pz6sw,glaceauglaceau,9,Sun Dec 21 22:10:08 2014 UTC,The fact that most recommendations are to look at 'black' companies or lines shows how excluded woc are from the beauty industry.
brownbeauty,2pz6sw,missfreshface,4,Sun Dec 21 17:51:10 2014 UTC,Looking at it that way does make me feel a bit better.

As long as there aren't that many active woc in MUA it won't change.   Or we could try to make this sub more active! I would prefer that. That way everyone who gets referred here can actually find this sub to be of use to them. I think we're a great little sub but we are definitely smaller and quieter than I would like.

brownbeauty,2pz6sw,slucious,2,Sun Dec 21 19:14:30 2014 UTC,I agree with this. I think some more structured posts and challenges would really help with contribution and more activity to this sub.

brownbeauty,2pz6sw,KTTeal,8,Sun Dec 21 16:28:43 2014 UTC,The easiest way for the majority to make am uncomfortable  situation is to ignore our voice and speak of theirs. It's hipster ignorance and social awkwardness.
brownbeauty,2pz6sw,cali5795,4,Sun Dec 21 16:43:27 2014 UTC,"I don't see derailment that often, but there is just such a lack of effort to help people who aren't Caucasian/pale Asian skin colors. Like I understand, you may not be able to offer advice on MLBB colors or exact blush shades, but it's not hard to say ""hey, this is a great color"" or ""try applying blush higher"" or ""your highlighter is a little too pink and light for you"".   In putting so much emphasis on being like ""omg, look how inclusive we are,"" instead of giving people of different needs the same treatment as people without those needs, people with needs outside the standard pale (white) norm are othered."
brownbeauty,2pz6sw,Brompton_Cocktail,5,Mon Dec 22 05:38:57 2014 UTC,"I think one issue for WoC who are into make-up is content availability. Many places like MUA and even Sephora's Beauty Board are mostly filled with white girls' pictures. Although it's useful, of course, I think there is great value in seeing  people of your own skin tone wearing something. This is true especially for products that are 'highly recommended' for WoC. For e.g., I've been looking for a light contouring option and I was asked to look at Too Faced Chocolate Soleil bronzer. When I looked up Sephora's beauty board for that product, there were hardly any people of my skin tone there.   I think the 'fix' for this is to generate content that are WoC-friendly in our forums and elsewhere. I am very scared of putting my picture up on the internet (irrational, I know), so I am trying to be braver and contribute to building content on this sub-reddit. Even though we are a smaller market for cosmetics (in the US), I feel like we are even more underrepresented when it comes to people who share how what looks on them.   As of now, I'm trying to de-lurk and CC, suggest based on my experiences. I think we require a collective effort to build the collection of pictures & tutorials for WoC.  (edit: grammar)"
brownbeauty,2pz6sw,melloniel,5,Sun Dec 21 17:27:48 2014 UTC,"This pale humble bragging/derailment seems to be inherent to the subreddit, I just took a peek at the sidebar recommendations and instead of focusing on just brands and specific products, they also have recommendations for specific colour.. not organized by skintone in any way but rather what they consider ""universal"", Nars Orgasm or Deep Throat are not universal shades by any means... neither are the Benefit and Too Faced bronzers... neither are the UD Naked palettes (I'm not particularly dark but the colours all appear mostly the same muddy taupe-y glitter bomb)... Is this being nit-picky? I can't imagine it would be too hard to categorize into 3 skintones and add suggestions based on that...

I don't personally know, but I do know this website called findation is really great for giving a starting point for finding a good shade in a ton of different brands. I did a search using the info you gave here, and it looks like there are a few shades by CoverGirl you should check out. :)"
brownbeauty,2py24i,HaleyMcFly,2,Sun Dec 21 14:50:56 2014 UTC,Covergirl Outlast 3-in-1 foundation and Classic Tan (860) is a good match for me. I might be a tad darker than you - so I suggest checking out a shade lighter.   This is a very good foundation and has worked well for my dry skin and mild hyper-pigmentation. You may even be able to pull off one shade lighter or darker than your actual match because it is very blend-able.

brownbeauty,2prcek,itsadooozy,8,Fri Dec 19 04:56:20 2014 UTC,"It looks good! I'm not sure if this is right, but this looks like an orange-red to me? Something you may want to try is different ""temperatures"" of red, like a blue-red vs true red vs an warm-red (orange-red) and see what you like the most.  You look pretty similar in coloring to me and I lurrrrrve how blood reds look on me.  But keep rocking the bright lipstick!"
brownbeauty,2prcek,motor_mouth,6,Fri Dec 19 12:17:33 2014 UTC,"Yeah, OP should try a blueish red to compare. I think we all tend to default to warm red lipsticks because that's what the beauty magazines always tell us we should go for, but sometimes a blue-based red can be quite gorgeous. They always show up as a reddish fuchsia against my skin tone and I get so many compliments on my lip colour when I wear cooler blue reds."
brownbeauty,2prcek,creamcheesefiasco,3,Fri Dec 19 13:31:17 2014 UTC,"Totally agree about the blue-reds instead of orange-reds. Some of my favorite blue-reds are MAC Russian red, NARS Cruella, and Sephora lip cream in Always Red (that stuff lasts ALL day)"

brownbeauty,2pq78f,c3bysparrow,3,Thu Dec 18 22:20:42 2014 UTC,"I'll copy paste my review from my blog:   The shadows are so soft to the touch, and slightly powdery, like most Hourglass products (I'm referring to the Ambient Lighting Blushes). They are well pigmented, so you ladies of the darker color will definitely find this one up your alley. The blend ability is out of this world, so even shadow n00bs like myself have an easy time blending my colors.  The lightest shade, which will be referred to as Shade #1 from now on, is matte, smooth, slightly powdery, and applies mostly opaque. It's a great base color and is warm enough to be worn alone.  The next shade, henceforth referred to as Shade #2 is a warm, matte, milk chocolate brown color with the same texture as Shade #1.  The middle shade, which has attracted the most attention of makeup lovers, and will be called Shade #3, is a shimmer gold-brown color. The texture is a little less smooth, still powdery, and I accidentally got it in my eye while applying. Not fun.  Shade #4 is a cooler matte brown than Shade #2 and has a very similar texture to the first two shades. I'd recommend it for neutral, night looks while Shade #2 is for neutral, day looks.  Shade #5 is a cool, matte, dark brown and is my usual crease color for any look using this palette. Easy to blend and well pigmented, this shade gives a lot of dimension to my looks and could be used as an all over lid color for a smokey eye.  I haven't tried mixing the shades, which has been suggested due to the pan less layout of this palette, but I'm excited to try soon and give you an update.

brownbeauty,2ppfx7,Wallflower191,4,Thu Dec 18 18:39:54 2014 UTC,I feel like we have similar skin tones! I did the Colour IQ matching at Sephora and my top match was Makeup Forever in 170 Caramel.  I tested it in store and I really like the coverage and feel. But it's a bit out of my price range so I'm using Maybelline Fit Me right now and I'm mixing 315 and 330. It took me a while to find a foundation that actually matched.
brownbeauty,2ppfx7,NessaBakes,2,Thu Dec 18 19:42:18 2014 UTC,I don't think we have Sephora at all here in England but I will take a look anyway and see what I find.   I am hopefully going to go shopping once my flu is better so I can try some new make up then.
brownbeauty,2ppfx7,NessaBakes,1 point,Thu Dec 18 19:44:53 2014 UTC,"I went shopping today and found the Maybelline Fit Me foundation and ended up getting it in 210. Tried it when I went out earlier tonight and it is lovely!   It looks really good on my skin and I love that it's quite moisturising and not dry at all, even with a powder on top. I ended up getting the pressed powder and concealer to match too. Glad I picked the shade I did too, spent so long in store trying to figure out if it was right for me. Thank you for the tip :)"

brownbeauty,2ppfx7,Kee369,1 point,Sun Dec 21 00:41:21 2014 UTC,"Yeah, 210, it matched best with my skin. I had a look at a shade darker and it only made my skin look slightly orange.   My skin tone always seems to look more yellow in pictures so it's really hard to get a right image of the actual tone of it.  http://i.imgur.com/1IbakQf.jpg This might be little closest I think.   I'm really liking it so far. The coverage is pretty good, I have patchy reddish skin just on one cheek, it's evened it out very well and I love that my face isn't super dry, even with a powder over it. My skin looks really smooth too, which is great!"
brownbeauty,2ppfx7,Brompton_Cocktail,3,Sun Dec 21 00:52:55 2014 UTC,I'm Indian NC40-42 with pretty dry skin and my holy grail foundation is Bobbi brown skin foundation. Bobbi brown gets all the undertones right so the warm tones are warm enough and the cool tones are cool enough.   Another great buildable option is Mac face and body   I've also heard good things about maybelline fit me foundations. But color matching at the drugstore for me is a nightmare
brownbeauty,2ppfx7,motor_mouth,1 point,Thu Dec 18 19:29:19 2014 UTC,"I have pretty dry skin too which is why I loved the one I used to use, it used to keep my face feeling light and hydrated.   I don't think any store in my town sells Bobbi Brown (yes, the shopping here sucks) and I'd much rather test them in person rather than buy online, I hate wasting.   I had a sample of Mac face and body once and loved it, but I couldn't find the right shade for me. One made my skin quite orange and the lighter shade was too light.   I will take a look at the Maybelline fit me ones too.   Thanks for the advice :)"

brownbeauty,2pnikh,asuka_is_my_co-pilot,5,Mon Dec 22 01:01:53 2014 UTC,Anastasia recently had a new palette and they used an Indian model (I think?)   Also chocolate bar palette.
brownbeauty,2pnikh,Wafflefart,3,Thu Dec 18 06:39:13 2014 UTC,I saw on the sephora website a new chocolate bar palette. It's called dark chocolate and is supposed to be warmer and deeper and it has a teal color.
brownbeauty,2pnikh,asuka_is_my_co-pilot,3,Thu Dec 18 15:43:00 2014 UTC,Different than the semi sweet bar that came out this week?
brownbeauty,2pnikh,jingabobo,5,Thu Dec 18 15:50:08 2014 UTC,"Hi There, first off let me just say what a thoughtful gesture to research about the right type of palette to buy for your friend!  Many people forget that deeper skin tones have their own spectrum of optimal eyeshadow/lipstick & blush colors.  I'm a couple shades lighter than Nandita Das as seen in your picture but from personal experience I can highly recommend these palettes:  Lorac Pro  UD Vice 3  Stila Eyes are the Window - Soul  theBalm NudeTude  Tarte Rainforest After Dark  Tarte Bon Voyage Set  WetnWild Comfort Zone"
brownbeauty,2pnikh,FreeRangeGirl,1 point,Fri Dec 19 01:49:41 2014 UTC,"Thank you, I was looking at palettes and I noticed that a lot of them had many really light/almost white colors. It's not that I don't think she could rock them, but it reminded me of many shoes where they have a ""nude"" shade that is really only nude for people with white skin.  I just wiki'ed Nandita Das and she is such a cool lady! Her philanthropic work is outstanding. It's a neat coincidence that I think her skin matches my friend the best, and she's so outspoken against skin lightening in India!  No matter what I've got to get her Comfort Zone, it's so pretty and inexpensive, how could I not?! I'm completely obsessed with the Bon Voyage set as well, I think she would really love it.   Thank you so very much for taking the time to respond so thoughtfully, you've helped me greatly!"
brownbeauty,2pnikh,motor_mouth,3,Fri Dec 19 22:18:15 2014 UTC,"Neutral palette - Lorac Pro. I am about the same skin tone and their shadows are very pigmented. With many other popular nude palettes, all ""neutrals"" look the same on me! $42 ish.   Non-neutral palette - Anastasia BH Tamanna palette. $29 ish. Both these palettes are excellent value for money, imo."

brownbeauty,2p1tq7,Brompton_Cocktail,2,Fri Dec 12 09:27:44 2014 UTC,"Why thank you! It is so refreshing to see dark enough colors from a mainstream makeup brand. I have heard of Sleek and always wanted to try it, so I think Amazoning it is a great option. This may be my winner!  But I was poking around and so found the Sleek face contour kit that just comes with a contour and highlight. This could be a silly question but do I need a bronzer? I think I always look naturally bronzed but I would be wrong."

brownbeauty,2ob3cl,Kee369,8,Fri Dec 5 00:15:00 2014 UTC,"Yikes! What poor offerings! My sister is considered caramel complexion -- no where near brown or dark skinned yet Armani considers the 11.5 ""deep"" or ""dark""? That's shameful.   Lupita come save us!"
brownbeauty,2ob3cl,mahoganyjones,3,Fri Dec 5 15:10:47 2014 UTC,"We had a national artist from Armani come into my store for an event (I work at a high-end retailer), and since I'm in the market for a winter foundation, I decided to give it a go.   Not only was I in-between shades, but the shade that was closest to my skin tone still looked too ""bright"" (i.e. yellow-undertoned when I know I'm more of an orange/red base) and it gave me the worst case of pancake-face. I appreciated what the MUA was trying to do, but I guess I'll have to stick to my Smashbox for the moment until I can find another brand with better ranges for brown beauties."
brownbeauty,2oc5c7,Anne_of_Avonlea,3,Fri Dec 5 05:10:11 2014 UTC,"I don't think it will be too fair.  Black Radiance's Toasted Almond blush looks like it's pretty close to Marsala, and that's an amazing blush on brown skin.    But yeah.  For once I'm excited about the color of the year.  It's actually a color that works on me."
brownbeauty,2oc5c7,frumperbell,2,Fri Dec 5 23:12:55 2014 UTC,"I'm obsessed with this color, but I agree with you that its kind of already done by everyone. China glaze dress me up is in this exact color btw if you want it as a nail polish!"

brownbeauty,2o7dpx,ikandi,1 point,Thu Dec 4 13:40:59 2014 UTC,Awesome! Thanks for this... I'm. Definitely going to check some of these out when I need to restock on foundation!
brownbeauty,2o7dpx,Kee369,2,Thu Dec 4 23:19:21 2014 UTC,i wear the same shades and my HG are Hourglass veil fluid makeup in no 4 and MAC prolongwear in NC42
brownbeauty,2o7dpx,eagleonajourney,1 point,Thu Dec 4 03:55:55 2014 UTC,How long does the hourglass foundation last? I need something that's long lasting and doesn't start to wear off mid day.
brownbeauty,2o7dpx,Kee369,1 point,Thu Dec 4 04:41:34 2014 UTC,Oh its quite long lasting....longest I stayed with it on was 40 hours. I use the Wayne Goss method when I need long lasting

brownbeauty,2o7dpx,ikandi,1 point,Thu Dec 4 13:42:07 2014 UTC,Its good but honestly I like Mac prolongwear better
brownbeauty,2o7dpx,eagleonajourney,7,Thu Dec 4 17:22:42 2014 UTC,I was going to come here to post Mac face and body! I have literally never worn foundation besides on prom. I just hate the feeling of most foundation and - like many woc - frankly don't need it much except for my uneven skin tone.  I tried this at Mac a week ago and it felt so light and natural -  I'm going to buy it for my birthday in a bit. I feel like it's good for us woc who have uneven skin tone but no other (acne/breakouts) skin issues.
brownbeauty,2o7dpx,yougoglencocox,1 point,Thu Dec 4 00:01:53 2014 UTC,"Mac Face and Body is my every day foundation. I love it cause you can build up the coverage. If my skin is a bit wonky, I might add a pump of the Pro Long Wear concealer to boost the coverage a bit."
brownbeauty,2o7dpx,motor_mouth,3,Thu Dec 4 03:15:55 2014 UTC,Bobbi Brown foundation stick in Honey ....   That's it. I love the formula (sheer which is build able to almost opaque) and the finish (a dewy matte) and the color match (SPOT ON for my skin). There can only be one...
brownbeauty,2o7dpx,peedmar,1 point,Thu Dec 4 01:02:20 2014 UTC,"I second this. Absolutely love the foundation stick. I use the stick in combination with the BB Skin foundation, both in 4.0 natural. The stick has great coverage for my problem areas and the liquid is perfect for light(er) coverage everywhere else."

brownbeauty,2o7dpx,thefriendlypickle,3,Thu Dec 4 02:20:08 2014 UTC,My best matches have been:   NARS Sheer Glow - Syracuse Giorgio Armani Luminous Silk - 8 Estee Lauder Double Wear BB Glow Moisture Makeup - Intensity 4.5 MAC Mineralize Moisture Makeup - NC42 Lancome Teint Idole Ultra - 410 Bisque W   My complete list:  Perfect/Flexible Matches:   Chanel Aqua Lumiere - 44BA YSL Touche Eclat/Fusion Ink - BD60   Paler/Winter Foundations:   Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer - Sand Boscia BB Cream - Self-adjusting shade MAC Studio Sculpt - NC42 L'oreal True Match (original) - W5.5 MUFE HD - 153 Chanel Perfection Lumiere - 50 Beige MAC Face & Body - C5   Wamer/Summer Tan Foundations:   MAC Face & Body - C6 MAC Studio Sculpt - NC44 (if I'm VERY tanned) NARS Tinted Moisturizer - Cuba Revlon Nearly Naked - Toast L'oreal True Match (Original) - W7
brownbeauty,2o7dpx,theheebiejeebies,2,Fri Dec 5 03:35:13 2014 UTC,MUFE HD - 178 MAC Studio Fix - N9 UD Naked - 10.0   I've been wearing Studio Fix as more of a lighter dusting to do more color correction. I feel like it gives me a sheerer finish. But I think my skin tone has changed over the last few years so I don't properly match with this anymore. MUFE HD is the best ever. I love it and the finish it gives me. I've been looking for a sheer coverage foundation though. I've tried Smashbox BB in Dark but it's a bit off for me.
brownbeauty,2o7dpx,theheebiejeebies,1 point,Thu Dec 4 02:16:18 2014 UTC,Try Face and Body is the best sheer coverage foundation I've tried. And I don't have a foundation that photographs as beautifully as Face and Body.
brownbeauty,2o7dpx,theheebiejeebies,1 point,Thu Dec 4 03:17:04 2014 UTC,I will definitely go check that out when I'm foundation hunting next week!
brownbeauty,2o7dpx,theheebiejeebies,1 point,Sat Dec 6 06:17:43 2014 UTC,"They have a lot of options in booth Cool, Neutral and Warm so I'm sure you'll be able to find a match. I like that it can be sheer but you can work it up to almost a medium coverage if you wish."
brownbeauty,2o7dpx,theheebiejeebies,1 point,Mon Dec 8 15:38:51 2014 UTC,I'm really excited about my trip to MAC today! I was going to try Face and Body as well as NARS Sheer Glow from Sephora since both of those came highly recommended. Do you have any thoughts on the NARS line of foundation?
brownbeauty,2o7dpx,slucious,1 point,Mon Dec 8 15:59:22 2014 UTC,"I haven't tried any NARS foundation yet. I have heard a lot of good things about Sheer Glow but I heard  that Sheer Glow isn't sheer. LOL Anyways, try it out and let me know how you like it cause I did actually want to try that."

brownbeauty,2o7dpx,fantastic_lee,1 point,Mon Dec 8 16:35:51 2014 UTC,Well thats nly what I heard. It doesn't hurt to still get a sample right? Enjoy it! Let me know what you think of the Face and Body if you get it!
brownbeauty,2o7dpx,Denchicoco,1 point,Mon Dec 8 16:40:34 2014 UTC,I got a sample of Face and Body in N7 and N9. And a sample of NARS BB in Seychelles. I'm definitely leaning towards Face and Body. It gave me exactly what I was looking for! Now I just need to figure out which one suits me better. I'll probably post here soon and see what everyone thinks.

brownbeauty,2o7dpx,VenusExchange,2,Thu Dec 4 17:14:12 2014 UTC,In no particular order;   Smashbox 15 Hour Studio Skin in 3.2 Make Up For Ever HD Foundation in 173 Illamasqua Skin Base in 13 ELF Tinted Moisturizer in Almond (it's the closest a foundation has ever matched me!) Shiseido BB Cream in Dark   Mac has never worked for me so I gave up on it but it was handy getting my number so I can use it as a reference when talking about it online :P
brownbeauty,2o7dpx,VenusExchange,1 point,Fri Dec 5 04:47:40 2014 UTC,1) Nars Sheer Matte in New Guinea  2) Lancome Teint Idole Ultra in 10  3) Estee Lauder Double Wear in Amber Honey  4) MAC Matchmaster in 7.5  5) UD Naked Skin in 8  Nars sheer matte is my HG atm! I really want to try their radiant creamy concealer now! Next foundation I want to try is the MUFE HD one; Ive heard so many good things about it.
brownbeauty,2nw06e,angryspring,11,Sun Nov 30 23:59:37 2014 UTC,Can you post any pictures please? I struggle so much with finding a perfect foundation color. My biggest struggle is matching my forehead. I tend to get an ashy grey color sometimes even though the rest of my face is fine.
brownbeauty,2nw06e,gigizulei,5,Mon Dec 1 00:34:56 2014 UTC,can I PM you pictures instead? I feel uncomfortable putting my face on a thread.
brownbeauty,2nw06e,Anne_of_Avonlea,7,Mon Dec 1 00:40:52 2014 UTC,Can you maybe Google pics of celebs or something and post a pic of a close skintone to yours?
brownbeauty,2nw06e,Anne_of_Avonlea,7,Mon Dec 1 01:26:46 2014 UTC,"sure! I'm a few shades lighter than this Also I added an edit to my post that may help with your forehead issue! i forgot to mention it, but your post reminded me!"
brownbeauty,2nw06e,lilylolalu,6,Mon Dec 1 01:36:12 2014 UTC,"Hah! I knew you were going to post a pic of Freida! But I still think she's a little yellow, no?"
brownbeauty,2nw06e,gigizulei,3,Mon Dec 1 03:38:18 2014 UTC,"Maybe she is, but in that picture she doesn't look yellow to me at all. Tbh, I don't think Freida is yellow. I think she is a neutral color. Yeah, in some photos with flash she looks a little yellow but it's hardly any yellow, and it may just be due to the flash. In most pictures with normal lighting she looks neutral. She's the closest I could think of that had my skintone somewhat.  these ladies look neutral. I'm still a little lighter though, maybe by a shade or two. the girl on the far left looks neutral as well."
brownbeauty,2nw06e,GredAndForgee,1 point,Mon Dec 1 03:50:50 2014 UTC,"She's olive, Green."
brownbeauty,2nw06e,MintyLotus,1 point,Sun Dec 21 20:32:55 2014 UTC,"true, but actually olive can encompass a variety of undertones from yellow to green. I also read that sometimes true olives are also considered neutral because green is a mix of cool and warm colors."
brownbeauty,2nw06e,theheebiejeebies,3,Sun Dec 21 22:35:08 2014 UTC,"Yes, absoultely! I completely understand"
brownbeauty,2nw06e,Razzmatazzle,5,Mon Dec 1 01:46:49 2014 UTC,"Oh my gosh. I didn't realize the darker forehead and mouth area was a WOC thing! This makes me feel so much better about my face, thank you <3"
brownbeauty,2nw06e,keakealani,3,Mon Dec 1 14:27:14 2014 UTC,My skin is seemingly impossible to find foundation for because I'm very yellow green lol. I'm not orange/peach/pink at all so things just always look a bit weird.   It's a great idea to match to the forehead! I do notice that mine is a lot darker than my cheeks and that does throw things off.
brownbeauty,2nvg4t,glaceauglaceau,1 point,Sun Nov 30 20:53:45 2014 UTC,They look lovely! How do they feel? Thanks for swatching!
brownbeauty,2nvg4t,chiffonandheels,2,Sun Nov 30 22:45:08 2014 UTC,"Very similar to Lorac Pro. Not powdery, smooth and pigmented, very little fallout."
brownbeauty,2ntdvq,KTTeal,3,Sun Nov 30 03:52:08 2014 UTC,That burgundy color in Vintage Vixen is beautiful! sigh It sucks to be broke during the holiday season.
brownbeauty,2ntdvq,SparkaCat,2,Sun Nov 30 15:58:54 2014 UTC,"So, I was searching the internet to see if anyone else had the Champagne Dreams palette and I found a blogger who did and they had brown skin!

brownbeauty,2nrgjl,Kee369,5,Sat Nov 29 15:39:57 2014 UTC,I have the Lorac Unzipped palette and I like it a lot. Matte and shimmery shades.
brownbeauty,2nrgjl,recycledpaper,1 point,Sat Nov 29 17:52:23 2014 UTC,"I just looked into this now, and wow it's pretty much exactly what I was looking for! All those soft warm browns are gorgeous... How is the pigmentation and texture?"
brownbeauty,2nrgjl,recycledpaper,2,Sat Nov 29 23:26:20 2014 UTC,"The pigmentation is pretty spot on. Shows up nicely on my skin tone (I think im NC 43?) and a little goes a long way. Ive never really been the type to pack on eyeshadow so I never need too much for it to show up.   As far as texture goes, it's very soft. I like it a lot and just wish I was better at using it."
brownbeauty,2nrgjl,FreeRangeGirl,5,Sun Nov 30 03:17:03 2014 UTC,"I strongly recommend checking out Lorac Pro (original). It has warm-toned nude shadows that are buttery smooth with a good mixture of mattes and shimmers. I am NC42- 44 and have tried Naked 1 & 2, Smashbox exposure, Chanel Tisse Vendome & Rivoli .... and countless more. I finally found my nude palette holy grail in Lorac Pro.   I think you can build a variety of looks with this palette alone without needing fancy brush work. These shadows are very pigmented and you don't have to spend 10 mins making them show up on brown skin (looking at you, Chanel!). They have warm undertones so they blend in seamlessly with your skin if you also have warm-ish undertones. I am sort of an eyeshadow newbie and it doesn't take great skills to get a good look using this baby :)   If you also want a couple of colors with your nudes, check out Lorac Pro 2 palette. But the original is a good place to start."
brownbeauty,2nrgjl,FreeRangeGirl,2,Sat Nov 29 17:59:33 2014 UTC,"I've been contemplating the lorac pro palettes for awhile but have been hesitant. Those warm shadows look amazinggg, but I feel like I would never use the paler ones... I'm going to check these out in person and see how the colours translate on my skin. Thanks for this!"
brownbeauty,2nrgjl,so_fluffay,4,Sat Nov 29 23:32:51 2014 UTC,"I agree that they have many ""whites""! But I think you could use the pale shadows as 'bases' for the dark ones or use them all as highlighters (different hues for different looks). Even if you end up using only one of them, I still think the overall palette is worth it.   If you are really are reluctant about the pale shadows, check out LORAC skinny palettes. I own the LORAC Skinny palette in Nude. It has 7 shadows - 4 matte-ish & 3 shimmers. All brown with warm undertones with one pale highlighter. For $15 on Amazon, it's a great deal. Although - I honestly feel the formula is not as buttery as the LORAC Pro palette; still very good quality."
brownbeauty,2nrgjl,glaceauglaceau,3,Sun Nov 30 03:14:00 2014 UTC,Naked basics 2 will probably work better depending how dark your skin is.  Also UD pulp fiction has some similar shades to the basics palettes and is on sale for $15 at ulta.
brownbeauty,2nrgjl,musicmuse1122,2,Sat Nov 29 19:51:55 2014 UTC,I wear the shade spiced sand in estee lauder so my skin tone is medium tan in the winter times. The naked basic 2 was what I was originally looking at but they seem so grayish brown and I feel like I have enough of those...
brownbeauty,2ns1wh,Anne_of_Avonlea,3,Sat Nov 29 19:25:31 2014 UTC,The lightest color makes a nice inner corner or brow bone highlight.   The other two light colors are great for lining the waterline.   The green I like to blend along the lower lashline with an otherwise neutral eye look.
brownbeauty,2ns1wh,glaceauglaceau,2,Sat Nov 29 23:04:25 2014 UTC,"When I want to use the green, I use the dark brown on the left as the crease color. I like to keep it simple..."
brownbeauty,2ns1wh,Bricktastic,2,Sat Nov 29 22:33:57 2014 UTC,"This was my first eyeshadow palette, and I still love it. I've actually repurchased it. I love how versatile it is, without just being boring shades of brown or beige"

brownbeauty,2nj53z,thefriendlypickle,3,Thu Dec 4 00:57:59 2014 UTC,I recently picked up Temptu's S/B adjuster in 031 Yellow. It is like $27 however you only need the tiniest bit and it works wonders with shifting foundation colours.
brownbeauty,2nj53z,pluspoint,3,Thu Nov 27 03:17:45 2014 UTC,"Hi there! I struggled with right foundation shades for years (terrible oxidation issues!), and finally found my match in Clinique. Have you tried getting matched at a Sephora (if you're in US) or a Clinique counter? Their foundation runs from cool to neutral to warm undertones, so I think you might get lucky there.   I'm also around NC42, and I wear Creme Caramel in their Stay Matte range."

When I foolishly buy foundation online without trying it on, it'll often be too light or too dark for me, but just barely. If it's powder foundation (mac's nc35 studio fix foundation in powder) I'll use it to set my highlight or use as a nude base for a very netural eye look. If it's too dark, I'll often use it to contour/transition my shadows!  It's amazing!"

brownbeauty,2nhrqm,smm2194,3,Thu Nov 27 04:01:11 2014 UTC,"I'm not too dark, I'm mixed white and black, so I hover from an NC35-NC45, but I am a makeup artist and on my darker-skinned clients (think NC/NW50+), I use Coconut Grove eyeshadow by Nars as a contour colour! It's got the right amount of brown and grey that it works. But I use it VERY sparingly!   On myself, the items I like to repurpose are using those translucent setting powders as dry shampoo on the go because lord knows it's ash city if I use it on my face haha."
brownbeauty,2nhrqm,purpleoreo,1 point,Thu Nov 27 05:45:01 2014 UTC,I like to use elf cream eyeliner in coffee to fill in my brows. It works great and doesn't smudge.
brownbeauty,2ndccv,rachz,2,Tue Nov 25 13:43:55 2014 UTC,Try Essence I Love Stage primer. You can use it on its own as a concealer or as a corrector/primer under concealer. It's $4 at Ulta.
brownbeauty,2ndccv,glaceauglaceau,2,Tue Nov 25 17:01:22 2014 UTC,Thank you! i'll have to look and see if i can get it here. i forgot to mention i live in the UK haha

I think they have a few darker shades. I got it for like $2, but I think that was during one of their crazy sales. Slap on a little banana powder and my skin looks flawless, and looks like I'm not even wearing  at all."

brownbeauty,2n8i83,c3bysparrow,7,Mon Nov 24 05:08:14 2014 UTC,"I would maybe add a touch more eye makeup--something as simple as a dark brown liner on your upper waterline could really add something without making you look too ""made-up.""   If you want, you could also use a damp angle brush and some matte dark brown eye shadow to fill in your brows just a little.   You could also go a little further with lip color without straying from the natural/subtle zone. Something in a dark praline, maybe, or a toasted caramel with a touch of pink.   Your skin looks great--beautiful color, fantastic complexion. And congrats on the interview!"
brownbeauty,2n8i83,multirachael,2,Mon Nov 24 12:48:22 2014 UTC,"Thanks and I'll try that. I have sensitive eyes and the last time I tried tight lining, everything went horribly wrong.  I might try my MLBB in MUFE N9.  Thanks a lot."
brownbeauty,2n8i83,gigizulei,3,Mon Nov 24 15:46:23 2014 UTC,You have awesome skin! I'd play around with the eye makeup a little bit more. A simple eyeliner would do wonders
brownbeauty,2n8i83,motor_mouth,1 point,Mon Nov 24 13:41:20 2014 UTC,"I just want to slap on some wingless liner, but it's too ""dramatic"" with the rest of this makeup TT  I'm going to attempt tight lining again.. Wish me luck.  EDIT: Because I shouldn't reddit when I wake up."
brownbeauty,2n8i83,RubberDuckuZilla,2,Mon Nov 24 15:47:34 2014 UTC,Thirding the suggestion for liner - maybe a tight line if you want it to be very subtle? I would also recommend a (tinted) brow gel.  You really have beautiful skin with a lovely glow : ).
brownbeauty,2n8i83,RubberDuckuZilla,1 point,Mon Nov 24 14:38:47 2014 UTC,Dip brow to the rescue. I was being lazy and didn't even reach for it.

brownbeauty,2n7o0m,c3bysparrow,12,Mon Nov 24 00:09:18 2014 UTC,hmmm but they look so chalky! :(
brownbeauty,2n7o0m,chiffonandheels,7,Mon Nov 24 00:55:21 2014 UTC,"True, but I haven't had that problem when applied to the skin. Should I do face swatches as well?"
brownbeauty,2n7o0m,glaceauglaceau,5,Mon Nov 24 02:17:58 2014 UTC,"Yes, face swatches would be amazing!   I really wish Hourglass would come out with a line of bronzers or deeper blushes. Maybe those would show up on darker skin tones."
brownbeauty,2n7o0m,glaceauglaceau,2,Mon Nov 24 05:26:18 2014 UTC,"When the sun is out tomorrow, I'll do some face swatches, unless you want them in artificial light. There is a photo of me with Mood Exposure on (artificial light) for CCW, if that'll help.  If Hourglass made more blushes, I would buy them all. I went from more than $150 away from VIB to $17. I just recently found out HG makes my perfect mascara."
brownbeauty,2n7o0m,so_fluffay,1 point,Mon Nov 24 05:45:43 2014 UTC,It looks really pretty on you! I'm an NC45 and was intrigued by Hourglass blushes but ultimately they look like highlighters and I have way too many to justify even more.
brownbeauty,2n7o0m,jingabobo,1 point,Mon Nov 24 06:05:29 2014 UTC,"Thank you!  If you have a lot of blush, then I don't recommend it because these are expensive (but you get a lot of product so they'll last a long time). I went out of my way to buy (and had to exchange my palette which made me feel a little bad) ones with more pigment so they come out less like highlighters and more like blushes.   Mood Exposure was the one I was still worried about since it still looked a little light in the pan. However it came out nice and plummy, which makes me very happy."
brownbeauty,2n7o0m,jingabobo,1 point,Mon Nov 24 06:10:18 2014 UTC,"Ok, I need one more swatch and I'll be done with the face swatches. These need a base of some sort of base (either whatever face product or at least a layer of primer) over the area you're wearing it on."
brownbeauty,2n7o0m,fantastic_lee,1 point,Fri Nov 28 02:57:20 2014 UTC,Mood exposure and radiant magenta look good on darker skin tones. I don't have any of the others so cant comment. But especially radiant magenta looks good because the radiant light powder that it's mixed with has a beautiful golden shimmer.
brownbeauty,2n7o0m,fantastic_lee,3,Sat Dec 27 04:46:36 2014 UTC,"I hunted down almost all of the shades with as much pigment as I could get in store (Sephora) and these blushes look great! I couldn't just be confined to just Radiant Magenta, but I have it as well! If you try the hashtag on Instagram, you'll see my posts, so avoid that.  EDIT: This is swirl finger in powder twice, one swipe along the skin."

brownbeauty,2n1ddl,NessaBakes,1 point,Sat Nov 22 00:19:12 2014 UTC,Found these brushes at my local Walmart in Ontario today! I just ordered a set of Zoeva brushes online but I've heard awesome things about the Real Techniques brushes and they're pretty affordable.

brownbeauty,2n1bzl,NessaBakes,6,Sat Nov 22 00:05:03 2014 UTC,They hands down have the one of the highest amounts of coverage you can find in a Western BB Cream and I did appreciate the yellow undertones.  I'm an NC 40 and I used the shade BB3.  The only reason I stopped using it was the lack of SPF and the skin friendlier ingredients in my Asian BBs....that and my roommate kinda used it when I was gone and somehow made a huge mess all over the bottle ><.
brownbeauty,2n1bzl,pinay53,5,Sat Nov 22 02:03:34 2014 UTC,"I've never seen a Walmart with a beauty display that pristine.  I'm jealous.    I'm also curious to hear if Flower is any good.  I've heard about it, but, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever heard anyone talk about using it on any of the beauty subs I frequent."
brownbeauty,2n1bzl,frumperbell,3,Sat Nov 22 00:50:03 2014 UTC,Haha I know what you mean! This Walmart is actually a newer one that opened near me about 3-4 months ago so the store is still in a relatively clean condition :P
brownbeauty,2n1bzl,chiffonandheels,2,Sat Nov 22 01:01:25 2014 UTC,"I heard that the flower foundations were a bit on the yellow side (for lighter girls, not sure about the darker foundations) but if they run a little more yellow, going for a shade that you think is a bit too pink might work!"
brownbeauty,2n1bzl,cherrypineapple,2,Sat Nov 22 01:14:33 2014 UTC,"I tried their cream blush in peach blossom. Its such a pretty colour, but too oily for my skin, all of it transferred onto my hand, yuck!"
brownbeauty,2n1bzl,PolyethylenePam,1 point,Sat Nov 22 01:42:21 2014 UTC,Urban Decay has a matte setting spray you might be interested in. I use the hydrating one and it does an amazing job of keeping your makeup right where it's supposed to be!
brownbeauty,2n1bzl,purplepingu,2,Sat Nov 22 04:24:16 2014 UTC,"I have 3 lipsticks from this line, and they're amazing. Pigmented in one swipe, both the mattes and shine finishes. I have Rose Bud, Tender Tuberose and Ginger Lily. For $6.96 each, you can't go wrong! I'd say they rival the NARS Audacious lipsticks, and I own 3 of those as well."

It's like no matter what I do, whatever product I wear, my knuckles are white as snow and I look like I don't know wtf lotion is.   So when I stopped by Walgreens last week to pick up some cotton balls, I rejoiced when I saw this: Carmex Healing Hand Cream for $0.99. I freaking live on Carmex for my lips throughout the year and had no idea this hand cream existed. I bought two (one with aloe vera) and it has been a lifesaving products for my poor white knuckles. Definitely check this out if you're like me and have major trouble retaining moisture on your hands and feet.   The best part about the formula is that it isn't waxy or greasy which is what I hate about lotion.   tl;dr i would marry carmex if i could"

Sometimes I make a bad decision and buy one of the holiday ones and then spend the rest of the next year sadly trying to finish it.  I usually use the Aveeno Positively Radiant w SPF 30 in the winter, but my skin feels suuuuuper dry and flaky this year so we'll see how this works out, and if I have to switch out later. For my lips, at night I'm using the Nivea Pure & Natural Mint & Minerals lipbalm, and if they feel extra dry, I layer a little bit of Tokyomilk Dark's Lip Elixir in La Vie en Rose on top.

Once a week I plan on doing an Aztec healing clay mask with milk or apple cider vinegar, haven't yet bc lazy. My lips don't get too chapped but if they do I use Aquaphor in the tube.

Marlena's suggestions  K so what I decided is that it was easier to look up dupes for the MUG colours and then google swatches of those.

brownbeauty,2m2h9h,chiffonandheels,4,Wed Nov 12 12:57:42 2014 UTC,"Uhh I know she's a makeup artist, but her application method seems a bit flawed-- using a stark white powder like LM for a yellow based concealer isn't really all that complimentary and her smokey eye looks really messy and creased."
brownbeauty,2m2h9h,throwthisawaybitches,7,Wed Nov 12 15:04:53 2014 UTC,"I think it's just the nature of the product that makes it creased, and she said in the video that that's the look they're going for"

brownbeauty,2m2h9h,frumperbell,3,Wed Nov 12 15:15:34 2014 UTC,"Sort of.  I use foundation all over, and then I highlight with a lighter concealer.  Like you, the center of my face is a little lighter, and it looks much more natural when I do at least highlight and (if I have time/feel like it) contour than if I just do one color of foundation.  It never really made sense to me until someone posted this tutorial in here (thank you, whoever you were, you totally changed my life).  Fair warning, it's in French and the actual tutorial starts around 4:20.    Here's another one where she uses BlackUp's Contouring Stick (which I've never heard of, and now really want.)"

brownbeauty,2m2h9h,mcpagal,2,Wed Nov 12 15:17:17 2014 UTC,"I only understand 1 word in 10 (thanks HS French!) but the gist of it is that she's doing a review of Ben Nye Banana Powder.  It's good for setting your highlight ala Kim K or for an all over powder if your darker skinned (which is how I use it).    Then she demonstrates by using a lighter color to highlight the center of the face.  She puts the concealer/or whatever it is on with her fingers in a triangle under the eye, down the center of the nose, the middle of the chin, and right above the eyebrows before blending it out with a Beauty Blender.  After that, she sets it by using a powder puff to apply the Banana Powder by pressing it on.  Finally, she blends it all out with a brush."

It comes in the boxes in the skincare aisle and she's fair south asian so I'm not sure how dark it runs. I also think it's a tad expensive $15-$20.  I like the Maybelline BB cream. It has an SPF, gives me a good amount of coverage and doesn't emphasize any dry spots. Only thing is that medium is a little ashy on NC45, and dark is too deep."

brownbeauty,2ltjaa,gooftroopd,2,Mon Nov 10 02:23:38 2014 UTC,"Is the lighter foundation that you're using the same undertone as your regular foundation? That could be the problem.   Using foundation to highlight isn't incorrect.  It's personally not my preferred method though.  This might be incorrect, but when I use foundation to highlight (which I usually don't because I like it to be more luminizing), I put the contour and highlight color (which is about two shades lighter/same undertone) in their placements on top of the primer.  And I place the base color in between those areas (hope I'm articulating it well enough that it makes sense).  Then lots of blending.  Set it.  Adding blush usually pulls everything together for me.    For myself, I find it more flattering to highlight on top of my foundation with a liquid concealer about two shades lighter when I want to look a bit more natural. I always have to set it though.    But on a regular basis, I use something more iridescent/illuminating/or golden.  I do this after I put my primer, base, then contour, highlight/blush.  I usually highlight with an eyeshadow, a golden peachy shimmery blush (when I'm short on time), or the popular staples (ie. nars albatross, benefit watts up--which is too shiny for my nose, nars illuminators, lorac perfectly lit, smashbox photo op brightener--find it more illuminating than concealing).   Hope this helps!"
brownbeauty,2ltjaa,Rukiabunny,1 point,Mon Nov 10 03:39:56 2014 UTC,It does thank you! My only issue with your strategy is that I use one of those funny looking blenders that I can't think the name of right now and the highlighting color ALWAYS takes over.   I've also been told to prime and base and then fill in with the highlight and contour so it's just confusing because I don't see a huge difference but again I think it's because my highlighting is the complete wrong tone. Ugh.
brownbeauty,2ltjaa,ElizadeathTaylor,1 point,Tue Nov 11 22:39:42 2014 UTC,"Hmm, I wonder what's doing this. Can you put up a list of what products you're using? Maybe we can figure out what might be causing this :)"
brownbeauty,2ltjaa,ElizadeathTaylor,1 point,Tue Nov 11 22:29:22 2014 UTC,"I use such a wide range of stuff just depending on what's comfortable but I've had a hard time finding non shiny primer.   Right now I use an ELF one I found at target and it's super shimmery which is kind of annoying but I deal.   For my base I either use maybelline dream matte mousse 3 which I've used for years, I love how easy it goes on and it's not much of a mess. On and off I use NARS from sephora it's medium/dark 3   And the bronzer I just found is q120 from the queen collective. For highlighting I was using tru blend but it feels waaaay too light and it takes over whatever else is under it super quick."
brownbeauty,2ltjaa,Tia-Z,1 point,Tue Nov 11 22:38:26 2014 UTC,"I'm thinking that for the area that you're highlighting, you could try exclusively using one product instead of putting the lighter foundation over your base.

I don't want there to be any sort of animosity within the community because people think one person is getting too much exposure etc. (Like how Samantha rose to fame and now gets hated on in r/mua). Perhaps a sidebar googledoc with a list of people in this community with blogs/instagrams would be good. +a section for the YT famous people.    Other thoughts about the side bar.

brownbeauty,2ldtol,frumperbell,1 point,Thu Nov 6 04:50:02 2014 UTC,Hey guys!  First time posting here on Brown Beauty. I love the idea of an exchange but I am based in the UK. Any other beauties based here or would it be an international exchange?
brownbeauty,2ldtol,soopaaflii,1 point,Thu Nov 6 12:37:15 2014 UTC,"Wooo!  Gift Exchange!  I had to skip last years because of finances, sadly. Also Woo!  Social Media Day!  That sounds like a fabulous idea.  Maybe we could get a regular calendar of recurring threads going.  I think the idea for featured blogs is a good one.  It's a nice way to see who we all are so to speak, and I love getting exposed to new blogs."

I was just curious if anyone could offer an anecdote regarding whether they've had the procedure done and if lasers work properly on brown skin in particular. I've actually checked SCA before, and even posted a simple chat / stupid question about it but didn't get any answers. Was hoping for some info from my fellow brown skinned folk, but alas not meant to be haha. Perhaps I'll be the first guinea pig to try and share what happens!"

brownbeauty,2lafof,fyourdownvote,3,Thu Nov 6 15:49:16 2014 UTC,I love how Nyx Cinnamon looks on my skin! I wish it was a bit more pigmented - you really have to twist the brush around - but it's just a perfect countour-y color (even though it looks like bright tangerine in the box).
brownbeauty,2lafof,youaintbad,3,Wed Nov 5 03:12:22 2014 UTC,"Am I the only one who has crappy luck with drugstore blushes? :/ they're always too chalky, don't show up on my skin, don't have staying power, or have too much shimmer. I think I'll look into some of the ones recommended here."

brownbeauty,2lafof,tropfou,1 point,Tue Nov 4 19:34:32 2014 UTC,Yeah we do (Rexall's/Superstore for anyone wondering) but I already have Luminoso and I just don't like it. Scared to try others because of that!
brownbeauty,2lafof,MintyLotus,1 point,Tue Nov 4 19:58:39 2014 UTC,"I love coastal scents blushes! They're really pigmented and long lasting, but they aren't available in drugstores-- they're also fairly inexpensive! I can only find them online, sadly."
brownbeauty,2lafof,frumperbell,1 point,Tue Nov 4 20:11:10 2014 UTC,"Luminosity is not the most flattering shade for dark skin, it doesn't have enough pigment to be seen. However the other blushes are great like corallina"
brownbeauty,2lafof,dongwoo,2,Thu Nov 6 07:24:30 2014 UTC,I like Wet n Wild blushes. Very pigmented. I have one in Heather Silk. I also like NYX Powder blush in Dusky Rose.
brownbeauty,2lafof,BunBunRN,2,Tue Nov 4 21:33:57 2014 UTC,"IMO If you're darker skinned, Luminoso makes an ok highlight but a terrible blush.  Everyone raves about it because the old Luminous was an Orgasm dupe.  The new dupe is actually Dolce Pink.  I personally love Milani, and I own all of them but two (Delizoso Pink looks ashy on me and I just never picked up Berry Amore).  My favorites are Red Vino, Bellisimo Bronze (it's almost too light, but works great if I build it up), Rose d'Oro and Bella Rosa.    I also really love Black Radiance blushes and their Gingersnap bronzer.   Toasted Almond is my go to Fall blush.  Wet n Wild makes amazingly pigmented blush for super cheap.  My favorite is Mellow Wine.    NYX makes great blushes too.  I love the cream blushes in the summer.  Glow and Orange are amazing.  I was a bit disappointed in Pinched: the powder version is great, but the cream one just shows up as a lite shimmer on me.  Cinnamon is my other favorite powder blush.  Hope that helps."

brownbeauty,2l8wdf,RealmsBeyondJ,3,Tue Nov 4 09:09:26 2014 UTC,"Would you mind specifying what you are looking for?  More details would be helpful. It says in the title of this post ""transpassing"" so I'm assuming that you want to wear make up like other women? I looked at your picture.  Other than your hair styling (which seems more masculine), you don't seem to have to focus on much beyond what the rest of us have to think about like - foundation, eye liner, eyeshadow, blush (key for desis), and lipstick.  There is more to it than that but check out the sidebar for ideas.    Maybe in addition to the above you might want to manicure your eyebrows?  I'm not even certain you need that in the beginning because  I had beetle brows when I was young, so..."
brownbeauty,2l8wdf,bebeembop,1 point,Tue Nov 4 10:16:15 2014 UTC,"Hi! My hair styling is masculine because I thought it would be better to actually get a shape for my face for now rather than clutter it up with other things. I haven't really tried much, so I know it may be confusing as to what I'm looking for, I'm slowly going throw all the information everyone has provided to me.  Thanks for the advice with the eyebrows, what's the best way to actually manicure eyebrows? I've seen that you can do it yourself or get it professionally done. Not so sure yet."
brownbeauty,2l8wdf,bebeembop,1 point,Tue Nov 4 11:28:54 2014 UTC,Sorry for the late reply.  The first time I tried plucking my eyebrows it took me 45 minutes (:-/)  so I would suggest just getting it done by someone else.
brownbeauty,2l8wdf,tropfou,1 point,Sun Nov 23 12:30:46 2014 UTC,Get it professionally done the first few times (I prefer threading). Once you've gotten the shape you can keep maintenance yourself with tweezing
brownbeauty,2l8wdf,tropfou,1 point,Tue Nov 4 13:55:24 2014 UTC,"And i looked at eyebrow shapes,  should I suggest one or will they let me know?"
brownbeauty,2l8wdf,LaFemmeFatale24,1 point,Tue Nov 4 15:20:48 2014 UTC,They will know what will be most flattering depending on your underlying shape. If you would like them to go thinner or keep a lot of hair you can let them know.

brownbeauty,2l8wdf,Anne_of_Avonlea,2,Tue Nov 4 15:25:19 2014 UTC,"My advice to you would have to be with the foundation. You did say that you're taking care of your skin, which is great, so maybe look for a BB Cream (I use the Maybelline Pure kind in the dark shade) or a light coverage foundation for more polished look when you wear eyeshadow and  lipstick (I use Marc Jacobs Gel Genius in Cocoa Medium). I went to Sephora to get matched to my foundation which helped immensely so I know what shade and undertone to look for in a foundation and they gave me some suggestions in store as well, but I like using drugstore foundation as well.     Determine if you want liquid or powder. I think that liquid is easier to work with, but I started using a powder when I started wearing foundation so it's all up to you. I say try both to see how it looks and how both react with your skin type.   If you are like ""does this match"" and you are at the drugstore; I always buy the shade I think matches, one shade lighter and then one shade darker with liquid foundation. I experiment with drugstore foundation because the shade I choose may be too light and mixing it with the dark one may work and I can take back the lighter shade.  Check out brands that have a variety of darker shades or ones that are geared toward darker skintones because you're more likely to find your match. Try the brands Black Radiance, Iman,  and Shea Moisture first to see if you find a match since they sell darker shades, then branch out. Those brands also have other things like eyeshadow,  blush, and lippies that compliment darker skin tones.   I hope this helps!"

brownbeauty,2l8wdf,Anne_of_Avonlea,1 point,Tue Nov 4 15:22:13 2014 UTC,No problem! Glad you could decipher my early morning speed typing lol.
brownbeauty,2l8wdf,Cerikal,2,Wed Nov 5 02:50:15 2014 UTC,Imo you have a face that's very easy to pass with. Get your brows threaded. Buy a pinky lipstick (Maybelline Pink Party) a drugstore mascara and l'Oreal's liquid liner. Practice lining your top lid - YouTube videos for this will help you. And for mascara just focus on making sure they don't clump!
brownbeauty,2l8wdf,Anne_of_Avonlea,1 point,Tue Nov 4 15:19:15 2014 UTC,"Hey thanks, can you suggest colors for other cosmetics as well? I'll make sure the mascara doesn't clump."
brownbeauty,2l8wdf,Cerikal,1 point,Tue Nov 4 15:24:23 2014 UTC,For now I would stay away from bold shadows. Unless you love/can apply them well. Maybe get the Maybelline Nudes palette for shadows. Gold and bronze work well for us. With bronze colours you can just apply one colour all over the lid which makes it easy.  Medium pink blushes/peach blushes are a safe bet too.  MAC Coppertone/Fleur Power blush. I don't really buy drugstore blushes so I have no idea on that front.  Oh and your mascara should be black (waterproof is preferred by many). Same with the liner (for now). Make sure to check the packaging because sometimes it can be hard to find.

brownbeauty,2l3i83,ChouettePants,6,Sun Nov 2 21:22:05 2014 UTC,"Basically I FINALLY ran out of my liquid foundation (MAC Studio Sculpt in NC45, which, needless to say was the WRONG colour for me). MAC Studio Fix Powder Plus NC43 is what I was using during special events in the summer, but I needed more hydration. So I made the mistake of trying to search for a new foundation on the day of an event. I wanted something with sheer coverage, a little more dewy without being as shiny as Studio Sculpt looked on me, and I had heard great things about Nars Sheer Glow, UD Naked, and Bourjois Healthy Mix.   First, I had to find a Shoppers' Drug Mart (Canadian CVS/Walgreens) that carried Bourjois. When I got there... they didn't carry my shade. I guess I would be about a #58... they had up to #56. Lady at the counter was very helpful in attempting to order my shade, then realised their supplier only carried up to #56. So, that was a dead end.  Then I headed to Sephora, and I was discussing with the girl there that the skin colour on my face varies quite a bit, and I've always had better luck just matching to my neck and chest. She was very understanding & pulled a couple shades from each brand. For some reason, I thought everything looked okay too (maybe just lighting at Sephora?). I was matched to Nars Tinted Moisturiser (I liked the texture better than Sheer Glow) in Cuba and UD Naked in 7, and she gave me samples of both.   Once I was done my eyes and applied foundation yesterday, it was a complete disaster. I looked incredibly gray... Cuba was definitely not my skin colour, much less my undertone. UD Naked was more like my concealer than anything else. I really needed to have coverage with foundation yesterday, so.. get this. I mixed in some cocoa powder with Cuba until it more or less matched, then used my Maybelline Fit Me Stick in 355-Coconut to contour around my face so it wouldn't look too off. It took me about 15 minutes, but well worth it.   But yeah, I felt kind of odd walking out of that Shoppers yesterday, I'd never really felt the 'discrimination' as such. I'd always get by, but I'd wanted that Bourjois Healthy Mix for so long, looked for it in my home country (in the Indian Ocean), at duty free in France, Montreal, Toronto, I finally found a store that carried it and... they didn't even carry my shade. Yay! I may just have to order online without testing out the shades..."
brownbeauty,2l3i83,chiffonandheels,3,Sun Nov 2 21:22:48 2014 UTC,"I love the simplicity of having one shade of foundation that matches me perfectly. I've come to the sad reality however, because I'm not in the normal range of shades for most drugstore foundations (even mac lul) I gotta mix my shiz. And that's where the fun comes in! Mixing foundations is AWESOME. Have you tried that yet?"
brownbeauty,2l3i83,seirianstar,1 point,Sun Nov 2 22:50:22 2014 UTC,"See, the thing is, I always thought the whole point of foundation is to 'even out your skin tone', so I kept forcing myself to stick to just one and use contour if needed! I need to get on this and try a different approach haha. I bet you have the same problem as I do, warm foundations look too yellow/orange on you, cool foundations are not an option and neutrals match my chin but not forehead. Oh, the eternal HG foundation hunt!"
brownbeauty,2l3i83,fantastic_lee,2,Mon Nov 3 05:20:47 2014 UTC,I had a really great matching experience at MAC. I went to Sephora and it was a disaster. Are there MAC stores in Canada?

So now I'm stuck with a concealer that didn't work for me whether I like it or not."
brownbeauty,2l3i83,MyLittleLabMonkey,3,Mon Nov 3 18:07:25 2014 UTC,Yes these stores do have the entire line of products. I'm referring to the actual MAC stores and not the kiosks

I live in one, so I have very easy access to MAC.

Just a suggestion. :) But that's a great every day look - wish I wasn't so lazy to do my makeup more often."
brownbeauty,2kldj7,jingabobo,2,Wed Oct 29 13:59:18 2014 UTC,Thanks! Actually I forgot to list it but did use the Smashbox primer and the NYX jumbo pencil in the color Yogurt on top of my lids before applying eyeshadow. I think that helps to make the colors pop significantly.
brownbeauty,2kldj7,kip9,1 point,Thu Oct 30 00:53:29 2014 UTC,Well never mind then. :) This reminds me that I need to get more primer. I am running out!!
brownbeauty,2kldj7,Honeychile6841,1 point,Thu Oct 30 01:22:11 2014 UTC,"That lipstick looks absolutely smashing on you! Your eye makeup is nice as well, subtle(could just be the picture). If you want a slightly more dramatic look, use an eyeshadow base with some light color first and dust some translucent powder over your lids as well. I like to use an eyeshadow that's just a shade lighter than my lid color, all over my lid & then apply the bolder colors over it."
brownbeauty,2km7ig,sheeplessinseattle,1 point,Tue Oct 28 22:37:52 2014 UTC,I think silver can look great on the lower waterline.
brownbeauty,2km7ig,glaceauglaceau,1 point,Wed Oct 29 01:01:40 2014 UTC,"I'll give that a go, thanks!"
brownbeauty,2km7ig,moonjongup,1 point,Thu Oct 30 09:04:35 2014 UTC,"You could always try warming it up some how to cater to your skin undertone! Personally, I'm in the same boat and I find it really hard using some of the colors I have since they're so cool toned and look weird on me.   Maybe try the gradient with a color already under it, like brown. It would look really cool for the double eyeliner look as well, outlining the top part of your wing, assuming your wing is black! Good luck."
brownbeauty,2km7ig,fantastic_lee,1 point,Wed Oct 29 01:18:27 2014 UTC,"depending on how soft it is you could trying dotting it on the lower lid just underneath lashes which I think would look quite nice with a bolder wing, or of course adding an accent on a wing?  by dotting i mean kinda like this but smaller  by accented wing I mean this without the inner corner"
brownbeauty,2km7ig,hinatachan,1 point,Mon Nov 3 03:57:41 2014 UTC,"I have done the double cat flick and I think it looks the best! A thick line of shiny silver half-covered by a black wing is muted enough to be casual, but is still lovely and noticeable :)"

brownbeauty,2kko54,Anne_of_Avonlea,2,Wed Oct 29 15:50:35 2014 UTC,Oooh you'd look amazing! Try finding a sleeveless long orange maxi dress and cut out a deep V. Accessorize and you'd probably do pretty well!   Get that scream down and no one will suspect you're anyone else!  PS Indira Varma is amazing and I think you'd do Ellaria Sand as much justice as she did!!

brownbeauty,2khyr2,Alythespazz,4,Mon Oct 27 20:38:57 2014 UTC,"You're going at a good time! at least the heat won't be unbearable, but I think it will be humid. I always take some UD allnighter setting spray because no makeup stays on my face without it, esp heavy event makeup. Personally, I barely wear makeup when I go back because of the heat and constant wiping off of sweat/city pollution, and stick to some eyeliner and mascara only for everyday stuff!   edit: also in terms of application, I spray my face with the setting spray after I prime and then again after I've completed my makeup. The double dose really works well. I basically avoid overly greasy, sticky products and stick to mattifying/satin finishes."
brownbeauty,2khyr2,xxoyez,1 point,Tue Oct 28 02:37:34 2014 UTC,Ok thanks! I don't usually wear too much foundation anyway so I'll just pick some up for the nights of the events! Thanks!
brownbeauty,2khyr2,raddaya,1 point,Tue Oct 28 12:39:10 2014 UTC,"Would like to add on to this that humidity depends a lot on where you're going, for instance Kolkata is going to be very dry."
brownbeauty,2khyr2,kloudnein,3,Wed Oct 29 05:14:03 2014 UTC,"This is coming from a Floridian, so while I am truly used to miserably hot and humid weather, it may be different for India! I am not sure if you're an eyeliner addict (like me!), but you might consider making sure you have some waterproof/water-resistant eyeliner. Same for mascara. Just don't forget remover to take these sorts of things off. Unless you need an excuse to go buy some there, lol.  I recommend for travel, taping(electric tape works well) any bottle or tube caps closed, to prevent them from exploding during transport. This is also useful for loose powder products. Also, put these things in plastic or leak-proof bags/containers separate from any clothing, jewelry, accessories, or other valuables. I hope you have fun, enjoy your special occasions, and have a safe trip! Can I request pictures of your beauty souvenirs!?"
brownbeauty,2khyr2,theheebiejeebies,2,Tue Oct 28 04:21:12 2014 UTC,Wow this is a great idea! I will definitely be taping everything before I go! And yes! A haul will definitely be posted when I return! Thanks!
brownbeauty,2khyr2,chiffonandheels,2,Tue Oct 28 12:41:51 2014 UTC,"I picked up 10 Lakme eyeliners when I was there. That stuff does not move at all. In the first few minutes if applying you can touch it up or smudge it out but after that, you need some serious elbow grease to get it out. Its perfect, especially for the heat."
brownbeauty,2khyr2,ChouettePants,2,Tue Oct 28 13:21:00 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I'd def get some good kohl liners while you're there. Maybe some decent henna if you're into that.  Try a bb/cc cream or tinted moisturizer for foundation. I don't even remember being Bangladesh (where my fam is from) being that warm during these months, but it's been a while since I've visited."

brownbeauty,2khg5g,fivetenths,19,Mon Oct 27 18:02:01 2014 UTC,I like the latter option because at least we'll have content to review before deciding to be driven to a blog.   Perhaps we can put a sticky of all the blogs various members have or implement having our blogs listed in flair instead?
brownbeauty,2khg5g,l0l0lol0l0l,2,Mon Oct 27 18:13:33 2014 UTC,"Yep, I also like the imgur posts with a link to the blog so I can click and read more if I choose to.   By default, I always skip over directly linked blogs, but it's such a shame to do that in this sub when a lot of what gets posted is links to blogs."
brownbeauty,2khg5g,firerod0302,17,Mon Oct 27 21:16:15 2014 UTC,"This may sound silly, but I don't like how...tricked(?)....I feel when I click on a link. The title sounds like a discussion post by asking us questions about our favorite products, and of course I want to read your opinions, then BAM...I'm on a different page!  I think there should be a flair that maybe says ""BLOG"" or ""OFF SITE"". I don't necessarily think we should ban it if we have the flairs to let us know, that way we could just move along.    Or mayyyybeeeee, we can limit it to 2 blog posts a week per user. I don't know much about bots, but /r/makeupexchange has one where it detects how recently you've posted since the limit is once a week."
brownbeauty,2khg5g,TheWorstIndianAlive,2,Mon Oct 27 20:02:58 2014 UTC,I agree. I came here for the discussion aspect. However I hardly click on posts anymore because I assume they're just links to someone's personal blog. I sort of like Skin Care Addictions policy of not linking to personal websites. It keeps the community focused on discussion.
brownbeauty,2khg5g,Anne_of_Avonlea,1 point,Tue Oct 28 11:07:25 2014 UTC,I feel like MUA has a better blog policy than SKA. SKA annoys me cause people will message with a million questions about Accutane or something and then I'm sitting there condensing my thoughts instead of just referring them to the comprehensive blog post I spent a lot of time on.
brownbeauty,2khg5g,Anne_of_Avonlea,1 point,Wed Oct 29 15:46:44 2014 UTC,I love the [Blog] flair idea. But I don't think most people link to their blog posts more than 2x a week? Well not yet anyways haha
brownbeauty,2khg5g,stufstuf,10,Wed Oct 29 15:48:17 2014 UTC,"I like what /r/AsianBeauty do. If you post a blog post, then you have to write a short comment summary about what the post is about. That way the blog poster has to be a part of the community, not just link dumping and bouncing. I hate that so much.   /u/firerod0302's idea of a flair sounds like a good idea too!"
brownbeauty,2khg5g,Alythespazz,6,Mon Oct 27 21:27:49 2014 UTC,"I think having an initial imgur post with the general idea of the content (swatches, opinions etc.) And then perhaps a link to the blog in the description."
brownbeauty,2khg5g,kloudnein,1 point,Mon Oct 27 23:39:30 2014 UTC,"I think this is good, too. Though limiting the number of blog posts per week per user might also be helpful to encourage authentic and new content."
brownbeauty,2khg5g,frumperbell,2,Tue Oct 28 04:05:22 2014 UTC,"I recently started a blog because I've got more indie perfume and makeup now than sense, but I've been hesitant about posting it here.  It seems like lately there's a lot of blog posting going on and I didn't want to add to it, or have it seem like trying to boost page views is the only reason I come here.  I also hate it when people throw up an enticing title and it's just a link to a blog.  I surf reddit quite a bit on my phone, and it can be a hassle viewing blogs in it's browser.  I don't mind it so much if it's presented as a text post with a tl;dr ""Hey guys I found/wrote this blog about Some Interesting Thing and thought you guys might like it.  Here's a link.""    So yeah, I'd be all about requiring blog posts to be text only or something like that."
brownbeauty,2khg5g,sheeplessinseattle,2,Tue Oct 28 11:46:38 2014 UTC,"I posted a recent blogpost of mine here, so erm, guilty. I like the idea of a self post with the link within, as well as having a specific [BLOG] tag. Either way, writing a summary comment/post about the content sounds like a good idea either. So whatever is decided sounds good to me.  I don't like a blogs ban though, but disclosure is best. Sometimes blogs get exclusive peeks/have swatches that I want to share and start a conversation, and I think it's good to have that option."
brownbeauty,2khg5g,jingabobo,2,Tue Oct 28 22:24:42 2014 UTC,"I agree with most all opinions posted so far. I too feel sort of tricked when a link takes me to a blog directly when I expected to see just a pic or a discussion.  I also suggest tagging the post [BLOG] and not directly linking but providing the link in comments/text which we can use if we choose to.  I don't think we need the weekly limit just yet but depending on how many blog posts we see in the future, we could think about the twice weekly type of check.  Overall I love supporting new blogs/youtubers but I don't want to feel like I'm being used to generate traffic without a choice in the matter."
brownbeauty,2khg5g,business_time_,1 point,Thu Oct 30 20:05:01 2014 UTC,Separate post and then a shoutout to the blog is cool with me.
brownbeauty,2khg5g,moonjongup,1 point,Tue Oct 28 05:52:48 2014 UTC,I think having a flair for [BLOG] would be helpful!

brownbeauty,2k76o7,gigizulei,6,Sat Oct 25 06:41:41 2014 UTC,Go to bobbi brown. I thought i was unmatchable but they made me feel normal
brownbeauty,2k76o7,doyouwantaballoon,2,Fri Oct 24 15:51:22 2014 UTC,"I third Bobbi Brown. I love it! The foundation stick is amazing. Expensive, but worth it."
brownbeauty,2k76o7,Anne_of_Avonlea,2,Fri Oct 24 17:16:30 2014 UTC,"I can't get my mind around a foundation stick. I'm just imagining it being really thick and cakey, like a concealer stick. How much coverage is it?"
brownbeauty,2k76o7,doyouwantaballoon,2,Fri Oct 24 19:45:12 2014 UTC,It is buildable in my opinion. I use a few stripes on a well moisturized face and buff it out with dense brush. I like it because it looks like my skin. I tried powder and liquid and I couldn't do it. I think it depends on your skin. I'm combo with really dry cheeks so moisturizer is key. But the product itself feels creamy.
brownbeauty,2k76o7,motor_mouth,3,Fri Oct 24 20:10:25 2014 UTC,I loooooove the foundation stick. I have somewhat oily skin and I stripe the foundation stick over my face and buff it all in with a damp beauty blender. The texture looks really natural.
brownbeauty,2k76o7,petitanomie,2,Fri Oct 24 21:24:10 2014 UTC,"bobbi brown foundation stick is seriously a godsend. i love it for touchups/travel/everyday ... i find it mixes well with moisturizer for day wear and then you can build up the coverage with a small brush on hyperpigmentation.   the trick is definitely to start off with a well moisturized, almost sticky face. the sticker the primer the better it adheres (think of the feeling you get after wearing a sheet mask/hydrating serum) and work in light layers."
brownbeauty,2k76o7,doyouwantaballoon,1 point,Sat Oct 25 03:38:33 2014 UTC,Totally agree on the almost sticky thing. It think it's what works towards making the foundation look like skin. I love this stuff.
brownbeauty,2k76o7,fivetenths,2,Sat Oct 25 20:23:21 2014 UTC,"Any chance you are near a Sephora that carries the Pantone Colour IQ? If you are, I would highly recommend heading over. They take a few small pictures of your skin and match it against the database and you have all the products they recommend sent over via email.   Aside from that, what type of skin do you have and what kind of coverage are you looking for?  I have combination skin and I prefer light a light-medium coverage so I use CoverFX."
brownbeauty,2k76o7,poop_cat,1 point,Fri Oct 24 17:42:04 2014 UTC,"I would second the Sephora recommendation. I did the pantone match and while it wasn't perfect, I did appreciate that the matches it gave me were across several brands. I was able to try things on in store and they gave me samples to take home."
brownbeauty,2k76o7,fivetenths,1 point,Fri Oct 24 18:00:15 2014 UTC,"My skin is a little dry but mostly normal. The main issue I have is that my coloring is somewhat ""patchy"" and this problem gets worse in winter. For the summer I have been wearing tinted moisturizer, concealer and pressed powder. For winter I am looking for a medium to heavy coverage."
brownbeauty,2k76o7,misschar,1 point,Fri Oct 24 18:05:27 2014 UTC,"I think with your dry skin, that may put you in the liquid foundation arena. I think that most of the suggestions you've received all offer a liquid foundation option. I would highly recommend trying each of your options out at the counter or store so that you can get a better feel of what you like or what you can rule out."
brownbeauty,2k76o7,kloudnein,2,Sat Oct 25 00:54:17 2014 UTC,"Estee Lauder DoubleWear was/is the only brand that have matched me perfectly and not tried to sell me 2 different shades of foundation for my forehead and the rest of my face (LOOKING AT YOU MAC). Also Nars Sheer Matte is amazing, as is their creamy concealer."
brownbeauty,2k76o7,misschar,1 point,Sat Oct 25 06:37:14 2014 UTC,"Wait, what? Why would they do that?"
brownbeauty,2k76o7,kloudnein,1 point,Tue Oct 28 04:22:24 2014 UTC,"One shade for my forehead, one for the rest of my face, haha. I had a weird complex about it and am super conscious of my forehead when I wear makeup now"
brownbeauty,2k76o7,misschar,1 point,Wed Oct 29 01:53:23 2014 UTC,"I have never heard of using 2 foundations for uneven skin tone. Wouldn't you want to blend the two shades naturally occurring on your face by wearing the same base color? Idk, I am so amateur with makeup. Lol."
brownbeauty,2k76o7,kloudnein,1 point,Wed Oct 29 07:53:23 2014 UTC,"nooo hahah she was the amateur, not you! it's definitely just a matter of blending  but I have no idea how her brain was working that day."

brownbeauty,2k76o7,jingabobo,1 point,Fri Oct 24 17:41:02 2014 UTC,I've used MAC and Clinique as well! I branched out from there and tried L'Oreal True Match (W6 worked best for me) and also tried Tarte Amazonian Clay (I was Tan Deep Sand but I'm lighter now). I have an oily t-zone and I found that I needed a powder with my True Match but I didn't need to set my Tarte foundation at all. Tarte is Full coverage and True Match is buildable for sure.   I'm looking at trying either NARS Matte Glow or BareMinerals next. Hope you figure out what you're looking for!
brownbeauty,2k3iek,sheeplessinseattle,2,Thu Oct 23 14:23:36 2014 UTC,yesss thank you for writing/posting this! I'm very keen to try this once my ill thought out shades-too-light Nars runs out

brownbeauty,2jpub6,pinay53,3,Sun Oct 19 19:55:47 2014 UTC,I'm a NC35 and I love Revlon Matte Balm in Sultry. I wouldn't say it's quite a MLBB since it comes across as a nice pinky brown but it is definitely still neutral/natural enough to wear everyday. Lasting power is pretty awesome too.
brownbeauty,2jpub6,ZooGirl,1 point,Sun Oct 19 20:16:53 2014 UTC,"I seem to be the only person Sultry doesn't work for. On me, it starts off as a nice MLBB, but after a few minutes, turns into a berry shade :(. I have super pigmented lips to start with though."
brownbeauty,2jpub6,definitelynotsatan,3,Sun Oct 19 21:31:31 2014 UTC,I have pigmented lips too and I've found that for a mlbb look we have to go with more sheer colors. When I use an opaque color it can look unnatural. My absolute favorite is Mac's Hug Me. I've also been using revlon's color burst lip butter in pink truffle which is nice for a cheaper option. I'm an NC 40 too for reference.
brownbeauty,2jpub6,youaintbad,2,Sun Oct 19 21:54:39 2014 UTC,"Ooh, is pink truffle the one with shimmer? I know I tried several of the lip butters and  one that was the perfect shade but with just enough of shimmer it was unflattering on me."
brownbeauty,2jpub6,definitelynotsatan,2,Sun Oct 19 21:59:56 2014 UTC,No shimmer in Pink Truffle :)
brownbeauty,2jpub6,kenshin21,2,Mon Oct 20 07:55:28 2014 UTC,"Yeah, Sultry is a deep hot purpley pink on me. Nowhere close to MLBB."

brownbeauty,2jpub6,jingabobo,2,Sun Oct 19 21:52:03 2014 UTC,Yup that's them! Very moisturizing. Not a true 'matte' as the name claims. Goes on smoothly too.

As for concealer, the only concealer that doesn't get cakey on me is NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer.   I would also recommend Smashbox HD Concealer, but the colour range sucks ass. They have 5 shades: palest, pale, kinda pale, orange, and dark brown."
brownbeauty,2jiwhi,P_Grammicus,2,Fri Oct 17 20:42:22 2014 UTC,"Aside from the other good suggestions you've received, two other good colour correctors are Yaby Cosmetics in Apricot (I like this the best of what I've tried), and Pixi By Petra also has one, named Brightening Peach. The big benefit to the Pixie Woo one is that it's cheap and available at Targets, though it may not be sufficiently pigmented for you.   When I use mine, I use my fingers, and very carefully dab it on after primer.   It's another layer, so I avoid using under concealer when I use it, though I'll do that if I'm not trying to get an entire day and evening out of a face."
brownbeauty,2jiwhi,shaysss,2,Fri Oct 17 20:29:47 2014 UTC,"If you're not on a tight budget, I use MAC prep+prime highlighter in peach lustre and MAC's pro longwear concealer. I mix them together on an artist's palette and then apply it under my eyes with a brush. It's the most heavy duty concealer duo I've found without it looking cakey. The highlighter is super light and even though I have dry skin the concealer doesn't cake. I've also used the Bobbi Brown corrector like others have suggested but it creases HORRIBLY under my eyes."

The one thing I found doing that prevented cakeyness of my concealing was starting to use eye cream religiously, day and night, I only use a cheap Aldi one just for moisture but once my under-eyes were hydrated properly, my concealing looked a million times better"

brownbeauty,2jd5tr,Anne_of_Avonlea,3,Thu Oct 16 13:42:24 2014 UTC,"So it's supposed to be 90s shade right? in lots of the MUA pics fair people wear it and it looks quite browny. On Jaclyn Hill it's got a hint of brick to it. I think on us you'd probably see a lot more of the brick tone, and it'll either be more reddy or more pinky. It also won't be deep enough for a cool 90s throwback but it'll still be a pretty colour.   Basically if you look at the album  http://imgur.com/a/WyLVb I think it'll look way more like the swatch on her close up lips, rather than the full face look, where her skin+hair deepens the look a lot."
brownbeauty,2jd5tr,sreneekim,2,Thu Oct 16 13:52:34 2014 UTC,Kat Von D's Lolita is a pretty close match for a spice colored lip on darker skin. I have it and i'm a NW40! If you want i can post a pic of what it looks like.
brownbeauty,2jd5tr,sreneekim,2,Thu Oct 16 04:29:53 2014 UTC,That would be awesome thanks!

brownbeauty,2jbgma,Anne_of_Avonlea,9,Wed Oct 15 14:04:47 2014 UTC,Definitely not sold on this blush palette. I would rather just get highlights that I know I'll use a lot more. Thanks for the review! I spent some time on your blog and I really like it.
brownbeauty,2jbgma,moonjongup,7,Wed Oct 15 16:53:27 2014 UTC,"Yeah I'm not entirely sold on hourglass products, but the blushes look stunning on you! It's hard for me to drop so much money a product that just makes you ""glowy""  If I were big money ballin tho, I'd definitely go for it."

brownbeauty,2jbgma,multirachael,3,Wed Oct 15 19:30:19 2014 UTC,"Wow. The blushes look so different with darker skintones! I'm glad you find it a good product for you, but its definitely not my style (or within my budget). Thanks for the heads up!"
brownbeauty,2jbgma,sheeplessinseattle,2,Wed Oct 15 19:00:46 2014 UTC,"thanks for this, the first one looks great on you."
brownbeauty,2jbgma,ethiobirds,1 point,Thu Oct 16 00:49:32 2014 UTC,I would love to get this but I think it's costs too much. If I'm going to put down that much money on makeup it's not going to be for blush. Hehe
brownbeauty,2jbgma,pendalmight,1 point,Thu Oct 16 14:29:44 2014 UTC,"Thanks for this post!! I wish there had been more swatches on brown skin like this last year before I got the Ambient lighting palette. Seeing this is making me not regret returning it last winter. Though that was for finishing powders, it's more understandable if it wasn't as noticeable.    Luminous Flush looks good on you. I think I'll continue passing on Hourglass powders.  I'd like it to be a bit more noticeable if I pay so much.  With the ALP, at first i feel like I had to convince myself that it had a great subtle blurring effect to justify the price tag....which it didn't.  :/"
brownbeauty,2jbgma,Rukiabunny,2,Fri Oct 17 00:13:42 2014 UTC,Oh god I know the feeling. I returned Guerlain Meteorites for the same reason.

brownbeauty,2jd48i,ikandi,1 point,Wed Oct 15 23:52:40 2014 UTC,I actually have never used brown gloss.  I think a light caramel was as brown as I got in glosses.

So, a really good friend of mine was kind enough to buy it for me and have it shipped to the UK. So far so good! I really enjoy it, and although I found the cushion a bit of a challenge at first I can't imagine using any other method now!  Hopefully this review is helpful to someone who is looking for a natural and glowy makeup base!"
brownbeauty,2jb9vo,Anne_of_Avonlea,2,Wed Oct 15 12:52:14 2014 UTC,"Thanks for posting this! I was clearly still under the misconception that Asian BB creams didn't come in dark colours. I love how it looks on the skin when you're holding the Hello Kitty doll.   I still do like Maybelline's BB cream though, as I saw you mentioned not being able to find them in drugstore brands."

brownbeauty,2jb9vo,sheeplessinseattle,1 point,Wed Oct 15 16:16:50 2014 UTC,"There's a few, but it seems like they're hard to find.  I know Skinfood's Peach Sake BB Cream runs dark enough for us.  I think Missha might have one that runs to at least NC40.  I remember someone a few months ago posted three or four she found that were POC friendly."
brownbeauty,2jb9vo,sheeplessinseattle,2,Wed Oct 15 23:05:51 2014 UTC,Can the cream be formulated so that the puff won't contaminate it? Is there such thing to maybe add preservatives or whatever so that bacteria cant grow from using the pad?
brownbeauty,2jb9vo,frumperbell,1 point,Wed Oct 15 18:57:27 2014 UTC,You're everywhere you are! Hi!  They say the puff is ruby cell antibacterial or something or other. I can't seem to find much about it to be honest. I wouldn't be so bothered if I didn't currently have acne.
brownbeauty,2j9ycp,chiffonandheels,26,Wed Oct 15 01:36:39 2014 UTC,"That thread made me irrationally angry... selfie sub? There is super high quality content here with people constantly swatching and giving helpful tips about products and skincare.   Furthermore, the institutional exclusivity of that subreddit is exactly what drove the creator to make brownbeauty. It's supposed to be a safe, judge-free zone for the POC who browse on reddit and are tired of the same posts that are upvoted to the top daily.   I realize we're small and significantly less active than r/mua but I feel as if we're being demonized by the very people who should be active on this sub and that double standard is beyond infuriating.   It's too damn early for me to feel this way -_-"
brownbeauty,2j9ycp,Anne_of_Avonlea,11,Wed Oct 15 09:59:42 2014 UTC,"Don't worry. People will always complain but won't contribute to a solution, so what can you do? I appreciate the effort you've (and others) have put in and I can see that the subs is growing. The text posts are more helpful here than MUA tbh and I get more replies here than I would there. People just expect to see posts with 3k up votes and that's not going to happen."

I've been an active member since the very beginning, and having to deal with demonizing sentiment from individuals who have no idea what the sub is about is effing disheartening. I'm sorry that MUA can't help you with your skin tone, but demonizing the place where you'd be welcomed with open arms and have your question thoroughly answered is not a solution.   :( sry im so super grumpy about it"

And yeah, I've never seen a more catty thread in my life.   As for the one in August, you can be the critic or you can be the change. These girls should realise that brown ladies are still the minority, and they get suggestions to visit here, why? Because people would rather they get informed help rather than suggestions from lighter people that may not work with their skin tone. Get over it. If you think you're too good to participate in this sub and make it more active than it is, then bitch about not getting attention over at /r/mua, then maybe you ARE being part of the problem, not the solution... silly girls!"

I tried my best to explain why that redirection is a good thing and how it helped me personally, I actually got helpful advice in brownbeauty that totally changed my make up routine for the better!  I hope whiny little princesses stay out and away from this 'little' sub we have going..who cares about upvote counts? It's not a popularity contest! I am happy knowing my posts here will be relevant and perhaps helpful to the audience here that truly understands our makeup needs & struggles. Omg I rambled on didn't i..? Oops."
brownbeauty,2j9ycp,blackgirldownunder,11,Wed Oct 15 03:07:55 2014 UTC,"I think the issue commentators had was less with the potential popularity of their posts and more with breadth of responses. Bigger subs = a greater variety of perspectives in the comments, and a faster response time overall. Smaller, specialized subs do offer more insightful commentary, but  if you're looking for multiple opinions (which most people are), it can take days to accrue them, and even then the average number of responders is small.  Whether you go general sub or specialized sub really depends on what you're looking for at the moment of posting and how long you're willing to wait to get it."

Nice blending. Also like how the intensity of the lash line makes your eyes look bigger.  It's really just the top of your brows that would need to be filled in here, near the beginning and the arch.    I do have to confess I get really neglectful with mine too. My brows are also naturally really thick and I develop a unibrow within like two days.  I get them waxed and maintaining the lower brow line by tweezing in between is simple.  But I'll end up getting busy and letting the top brow line get really patchy, and just pencil it in when I need to look presentable."

I finally found a few people who have a similar skinctone to mine and wrote down what products they used. Then, I went to some beauty stores to try on the products.   I've been to Sephora and didn't have any luck there. The person didn't understand what I was saying.  Today I went to MAC(just walked in, no appointment) and had a consultant match my skintone to the foundations I saw online. She also showed me how and where to apply which products. I told her I wanted to keep it simple.  She also matched me with blush, highlighter and contour stuff if I wanted it for later!  She wrote everything down on a little card that has a face diagram. It was awesome!! I felt like a movie star.   Besides having a personal consult(it was so relaxing and I felt pampered) I would recommend youtube tutorials. I've watched a million of them."
brownbeauty,2j1w84,seirianstar,3,Mon Oct 13 02:02:04 2014 UTC,"Could you book a session for her with an MUA, one where she can learn about how to apply, and what to use? I know there's a make up brand here in the UK who run workshops based on a specific look."

However, my top lip is brown, so that alters colors (pulls out more pink in lip colors)- not sure if it's that applies to you.  Also - my local beauty supply stores always end up having the best prices for NYX and a well stocked full display collection of all of their products with testers.  It's an alternative for Ulta or Nordstrom Rack if your boyfriend is able to find one. My local CVS and Target do not carry the full line (and they definitely don't have the new matte lip creams).  As an aside, I'm not a fan of the round label lipsticks, but matte Tea Rose with a brown lip pencil is my MLBB so far."

brownbeauty,2illf0,moonjongup,2,Wed Oct 8 01:00:27 2014 UTC,"As for NYX Butter Lipsticks, Taffy is the perfect bubblegum pink without being too light, and Razzle is a purplish magenta. They're both bright and compliment my dark brown Hispanic skin."

brownbeauty,2ilz53,theheebiejeebies,2,Wed Oct 8 01:42:09 2014 UTC,"To echo other commentors I'm liking Diva and Paramount for this season. Rebel, Media, Smoked Purple and Photo (depending on your undertones) are all good options too.  What colour are your lips? Brown or pink? It looks beautiful in swatches, I'm sure you'll be able to pull it off."
brownbeauty,2ilz53,Anne_of_Avonlea,1 point,Thu Oct 9 21:47:14 2014 UTC,My lips are heavily pigmented and are deep pink. I got Living Legend and Fashion Revival (from the new matte collection) to start off since its a deep plum. I want to later get smoked purple
brownbeauty,2iious,faith_trustpixiedust,4,Tue Oct 7 02:49:44 2014 UTC,You are beautiful. :) I'd suggest shaping your brows and filling them in lightly with brow pencil or powder.
brownbeauty,2iious,happydreamss,1 point,Tue Oct 7 08:09:10 2014 UTC,"Omg thank you for replying!! Abd I know!! I just changed jobs so I'm broke :(. As soon as I get paid I'm getting my eyebrows waxed, getting some foundation, and trying again. I think it would look better with a different hairstyle as well. Thank you :)"
brownbeauty,2iious,Trinibelle,2,Tue Oct 7 16:11:32 2014 UTC,"I'm someone who recently got into makeup as well (I'm 21. buddies? yay!) and I'd be happy to share some of the things I've learned so far.   Firstly, shaping and filling in your brows is so important. A well shaped brow really helps define the whole face. At first I never really bothered with it, plus i was a bit afraid (razors are sharp and I'm clumsy >.<) but when my friend did it for me and I did my makeup I realized what a difference it made. Tip: don't use black eyebrow pencil though. Unless you have a SUPER dark brow, it's just going to make you look scary. A dark brown works best for me, but try to match your eyebrow colour.  Also try to invest in a good foundation/powder combo. I don't wear it all the time, but if you really want that super glam look it evens out the tones of your face. I didn't know how to choose one that'll go with my face but the nice ladies at the beauty store helped when I asked. I'm pretty sure they'll help you too. :)  One more thing, I like to use primer before applying my eyeshadow. It makes the eyes pop and when you apply that eyeshadow, the colours come out more vibrant and evenly.  It's easy to pick up, they should be right next to the eyeshadow racks.  That lipstick I think looks great on you! There're some great articles online that help with choosing a lipstick colour. I can't remember the one I used to find the shades that work for my skintone, but if you want I can go look for it and post it.  This was kind of long, but I hope it helps! Good luck :D"
brownbeauty,2iious,starkey2,1 point,Tue Oct 7 15:54:28 2014 UTC,"Thank you so much for replying (buddies for sure!). Yeah, I'm really broke so I've had to let my brows get really wolfish lately as my mom would put it, but I get paid soon, so I'll do that, abd grab some foundation too. I was browsing abd I found some that I think matched my skin perfectly! Tips on applying foundation abd primer? I didn't put on eyeshadow actually. Just eyeliner to mask the gap with the falsies."

brownbeauty,2iious,Trinibelle,2,Tue Oct 7 18:44:01 2014 UTC,"I totally understand, it's why i went looking for advice on which colour would go the best with my skin tone, you don't want to buy the wrong one and then you're stuck with a tube of lipstick that you'll never use :/ I'll go look for the article and post the link asap."

Hope it helps you with choosing the right colour!"
brownbeauty,2iious,Trinibelle,1 point,Wed Oct 8 15:47:33 2014 UTC,"You can tots wear make up! I think it can be a bit of getting used to. Maybe you could do a trial run of wearing make up to the shop when you go get a pint of milk?   I think the red looks good on you. I'd suggest next time taking a pic in natural daylight next time you're after CC as it tends to show colours better.    WRT your brows, have you considered plucking them yourself? I do my own  and I much prefer it.  Watching a few vids and using a white pencil to mark the points has helped me a lot.   The only thing I could think of that could be a cherry on top of the look you've got going on is winged eyeliner. Red lips, thick lashes is pretty much a classic :D"
brownbeauty,2iious,betafrogg,2,Tue Oct 7 18:25:34 2014 UTC,"I agree with the red lips and thick lashes being a classic, can't get better than that!  Also I agree with your eyebrow comment: I do my own eybrows now as well! they sell those eyebrow razors that I use, and it's pretty quick. You can also pluck them too, it's so much cheaper that way, it just takes a little practice :D"
brownbeauty,2i1939,sheeplessinseattle,8,Wed Oct 1 22:17:19 2014 UTC,"Most translucent powders I've seen still have a whitish cast to them, but I also don't have a ton of experience. I am very light brown and my Rimmel Stay Matte in translucent makes me look a little chalky sometimes. Surely there are some better ones out there!"
brownbeauty,2i1939,hollyharlow,3,Wed Oct 1 22:24:53 2014 UTC,"Yeah, but reviews always say ""it's white on the pan, but disappears when applied!"" Looks like people seem to have better luck with mid/high-end powders."

However, my favorite translucent powder is Bare Minerals Touch Up Veil, which isn't white per se and I think leaves the best finish, unlike the other powders which can look a bit chalky."

brownbeauty,2i1939,kam90,5,Thu Oct 2 22:41:14 2014 UTC,I think every woman of color should invest in a Ben nye luxury powder. I find these leave the proper coloring and no garish white cast. I'm NC40 And I use banana which is their most popular shade but there's such a wide variety to choose from and the shade range goes very deep as well.
brownbeauty,2i1939,ethiobirds,3,Fri Oct 3 21:20:21 2014 UTC,"I second banana powder! I didn't think it would work on me (NC45), because why would this yellow dust not make me look ridiculous? WRONG. Shine @ gone, skin @ fierce."

brownbeauty,2i1939,Cerikal,2,Wed Oct 1 23:00:38 2014 UTC,"My two favorites are Black Opal Invisible Oil Blocking Powder (which comes loose or pressed.  I have loose), Ben Nye Banana Powder, and Bare Minerals Tinted Mineral Veil.    I like the Ben Nye for setting my highlighter or as a finishing powder (if my foundation is a bit too pink).    I like Bare Minerals under my foundation a la the Goss Method or to set a foundation that's a bit too pale.  I'm an NC50, but once it oxides on me it warms my face up a bit.    Black Opal is just great all around imo.  It works great to soak up the oil under my foundation, it works nice to set my regular concealer, and I like it to set my foundation on days when I know it's gonna be super hot and I'm likely to turn into an oil slick.  I've tried ELF's HD Powder, and it does work.  My problem with it is that you need to use a very light hand if you're medium dark or darker, and it causes flash back in photos."
brownbeauty,2i1939,Cerikal,2,Thu Oct 2 13:08:52 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the tips, I really appreciate it! I think I'll have to start hunting for Black Opal, I've only ever seem BlackUp in the UK."
brownbeauty,2i1939,mrslois,2,Thu Oct 2 19:06:00 2014 UTC,"I use Black Opal's Deluxe Finishing Powder in neutral. I found that those ""translucent"" white setting powders made me look like a ghost.

brownbeauty,2hykvb,xhelianthus,2,Wed Oct 1 06:21:32 2014 UTC,I don't know if this is helpful but usually when I look for IG inspo I use hashtags instead. For example I'll search #macrubywoo or #toofacedmelted and then scroll through the pics (it has to be somewhat specific or you get too many resale accounts). I find a lot of really good black MUAs this way and then go lurk their profiles. I also like doing this because they're more likely to reply to a question than the bigger accounts.

brownbeauty,2gmkho,whythehecknot,5,Wed Sep 17 03:19:06 2014 UTC,"I needed to pick up a prescription at Walgreens today, so of course I took a look at the makeup section.  I couldn't help picking up the Smoke and Melrose palette and Balm Stain in 2AM Call Time because: 1) pretty  and 2) limited edition.  The shadows were a bit powdery, but I was very pleased with their pigmentation.  I haven't tried them on my eyes yet.  There are supposed to be some dupes for Naked 3 here, but I don't own that palette.  This is the first Wet N Wild Megaslicks Balm Stain I've tried, so when I first swatched it, I applied too much pressure and a little tiny bit broke off.  It's very soft and pretty glossy.  Application was very nice.  It only took one swipe to get really good color payoff.  I can't speak about the wear yet, since I've only had it on for half an hour, but the swatch did leave a light magenta/berry stain on my hand.  EDIT: Corrected a spelling error."
brownbeauty,2gmkho,Jnnlopez,3,Wed Sep 17 03:19:14 2014 UTC,Totally buying these! Thanks for the swatches. They're great! It's been a while since I've purchased wet n wild shadows. I hope the pigmentation is decent on my eyes!

I'll begin by saying that the quality of your filming and editing are superb, coupled with the fact that a lovely young lady with a beautiful deep skin color.   That being said, the colors you used on the entire lid was not complimentary to your skin tone, nor was really found in the inspiration's look. I cannot speak for everyone, but when I view an inspired by tutorial, I am seeking for the instructor to take that inspiration but tailor it to suit her skin tone.   Additionally, I found your iteration of the look to be absent of any of Nicki's stylistic preferences, an understated cut-crease; It appears perhaps, that a greater level of observation and skill refinement will help your future looks translate much more clearly and fluidly in future videos."

I put it here anyway because it was $4 and since we're similar skin tone, I thought you might like the recommendation in case you're ever at Ulta.  Do you mind if I ask you which foundation you use?

brownbeauty,2g4dor,oceanatlas,10,Thu Sep 11 17:36:35 2014 UTC,"Oh man, I battled this for YEARS and have it under control now! I have deep set eyes which give me.. not quite wrinkles but laugh lines like yours under the eyes that help cause creasing.  First, get a good under eye primer and use less concealer under the eye. Also don't put powder under the eye area before concealer.   The primer I use, and it works really well is the CoverFx one (http://www.sephora.com/anti-age-smoothing-eye-primer-P378102) this stuff is great for creasing under the eye, but sucks for keeping eyeshadow in place, so only use it under the eye!  You might want to find a better concealer too. I used to use that Mac stuff and got insane creasing with it as well.  The best ones I've used are CoverFx cream concealer, Estee Lauder Double wear stay in place concealer and Amazing Cosmetics, amazing concealer.   If you're have a Sephora near you, you can get samples of all these to test out."

It's a sheer white powder, but doesn't leave a white cast on my skin, you only need to use very little.  if anything try the Estee Lauder concealer first. It's the best! Hope it works for you!"

I suppose it might not work as well for you as it did for me.    I've never ever had the Estee Lauder double wear crease, Lancome also makes a good one that doesn't budge either but they have a serious lack of shades, it's the EFFACERNES - Waterproof Protective Undereye Concealer"

I actually do have a full face picture I can post of this look! I only have the one eye done in it so I wasn't sure if it would look strange or not lol. I'll post it when I get home so you can all see what it looks like at the end :)

A quick youtube search for reviews revealed that no reviews have been posted about the box recently. The most recent one I could find was posted 9 mo. ago.

brownbeauty,2fknvw,leblady,5,Fri Sep 5 19:19:01 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I've been using it on my eyelashes and have seen improvement.   Here's the Ardell Lash Growth I use. I actually also use it as a brow gel, and it helps a lot!  Here's the Rapidlash version. I didn't buy this, but I think this is closest to the Latisse prescription.   The ardell has been doing it for me, so I didn't pick up the rapidlash."

And what are your goals with using makeup? e.g want a clear-looking complexion, want to create a smoky eye, want to look like I didn't just get out of bed, etc.  I've found that when I start with a goal, I can start learning things about makeup bit by bit instead of feeling overwhelmed by trying to do everything at once."
brownbeauty,2fgcqd,GCNerd,4,Thu Sep 4 14:36:11 2014 UTC,"Face pic would be helpful. I'd suggest learning and getting products for a good lip first, then a basic eye and a smoky eye, then basic contouring."
brownbeauty,2fgcqd,roctaviaalice,3,Thu Sep 4 15:11:45 2014 UTC,It's kind of difficult to tell you what to get if we don't know what you are interested in/what you look like. What kind of makeup would you like to wear? Do you just want to wear a little eyeliner and/or mascara? Some lipstick or tinted lip balm? DO you have any sort of dress code regarding what you can and can't wear on your face?  More info please!

I really would like to find a good mascara, and lip color. Also something to cover the dark circles under my eyes. And maybe something to clear my complexion on the days it gets blotchy.  I would like to keep it light, and casual."
brownbeauty,2fgcqd,moonjongup,1 point,Sat Sep 6 02:42:50 2014 UTC,"A good starter mascara is one of the Maybelline brands! Maybe try Clump Crusher or pumped up colossal. Maybelline has a bunch of ColorSensational lipsticks as well but for daily wear you might want to go for something light pink or brown - closer to a nude color. At ulta they're often BOGO half off so you can try that. As far as concealer, I haven't found a drugstore one that I love but I've been using NARS radiant creamy concealer and it's done wonders for me :)"
brownbeauty,2fgcqd,optogirl,1 point,Sat Sep 6 17:06:58 2014 UTC,"I think a great way to start out would be to figure out what skin type you have (oily, dry, combo?), then figure out the best primer, foundation, concealer, powder, blush, bronzer, highlighter, eyeshadow primer, eyeshadows, mascara, liner and lip products that work well with that skin type.  do you have a MLBB shade? I always find thats the easiest way to start"
brownbeauty,2f944a,5upern0v4,3,Tue Sep 2 12:20:22 2014 UTC,These shadows are gorgeous and the post you linked was great. The only thing is that I would have much rather preferred to see swatches on your arm or hand to see how the colours look against your actual skin tone. I am the same colouring and finding swatches on nc42 skin is hard sometimes.

brownbeauty,2f19l1,lipsticqueen,10,Sat Aug 30 21:22:42 2014 UTC,"What don't you like about your routine? Are you having problems with application of certain products or is there a look you'd like to achieve?   I think it's hard for people to give CC if you aren't being specific and it's hard to tell what can be improved from the poor quality picture (it helps to use the back camera- not front, find nice lighting, and maybe up-close pictures of problem areas as well as an overall look). It also helps to mention what's specially being used in a picture.   If your foundation varies daily, does that mean you're struggling to find one that you like? Maybe you could add a specific one you definitely don't like or describe what qualities you do like in something?   Since you aren't using any primers, that might help your foundation problem. They can cut down on shininess and really help with smoothing out skin and making a nice base for makeup. I'm using Benefit- Porefessional right now. I really like it and it helps blur my huge pores.   I do like your lipstick color on you. Maybe a liner would help to give you more staying power and definition?   Sorry this is so much to read. I just didn't want you to feel ignored. It's just easier for people to pass you over if you aren't giving them enough info to go on. Good luck for next time :)"
brownbeauty,2f19l1,Daisybug,2,Sun Aug 31 14:10:56 2014 UTC,"Agreed. Not that the picture was super bad, but I don't know what needs to be improved. I can say that makeup is not about using products that are popular or following colors that are trending. You have to know yourself, your skin type, and your likes and dislikes about your facial features in order to know what products should be used, what colors should be used, and whether to apply with fingers or brushes.   What helped me figure out my routine was knowing what look I wanted to go for. I also understood that makeup looks work for certain occasions. If I was going out I can play with eyelid color, glitter, bold lipsticks, etc. But for every-day I tone it down. I keep it minimal by only doing foundation, line my upper eyelid halfway, and go with a subtle lip color (nude).   Do you YouTube? I get inspiration from some of the girls or guys doing makeup."

brownbeauty,2eq5yc,randomOP,2,Fri Aug 29 16:19:42 2014 UTC,The orangey brown one all the way to the left. Does that one show up on you? It's such a nice color. Maybe try a mix of that and the darker matte brown.
brownbeauty,2eq5yc,jingabobo,4,Fri Aug 29 16:26:28 2014 UTC,"Ok so it's not like a Nude Palette but it has a ton of Neutral warm colors that look Fantastic on brown skin - Stila eyes are the window Palette in Soul or Mind.  Next would be TheBalm's NudeTude, lovely nudey neutrals.  I also really like the IT Cosmetics Pretty Palette, it's mostly mattes.  If you don't own it already, get the  Lorac Pro it rocks! It has both mattes and shimmer, warm toned and just freakin awesome all round."
brownbeauty,2eq5yc,so_fluffay,3,Thu Aug 28 01:44:38 2014 UTC,Seconding the Lorac Pro. I got it earlier this year based on /u/jingabobo's recommendation. No regrets even though I don't wear much eyeshadow any more.

brownbeauty,2eq5yc,firefliesofmontreal,1 point,Wed Aug 27 22:45:12 2014 UTC,This looks really nice. It's officially on my wishlist for my next indulgent purchase. Would you say it had a good combo and matte and shimmer shadows?

The unzipped palette is so great because every single shade complements the others. There's a matte highlight shade, a lighter and darker matte crease shade and a gorgeous plum. The palette looks beautiful but is even prettier swatched so if you can swatch it I would highly recommended doing so."
brownbeauty,2eq5yc,glaceauglaceau,1 point,Wed Aug 27 23:27:17 2014 UTC,I'm mixed too I (use NARS Sheer Glow Barcelona for reference) I think Loracs Pro palette would look good.

brownbeauty,2e89pb,cat_scratches,2,Fri Aug 22 16:28:11 2014 UTC,"Photos definitely help. The redness may be surface redness, which can be less obvious if you have olive tones (because green cancels the red a little bit).

brownbeauty,2e89pb,happydreamss,2,Fri Aug 22 09:20:39 2014 UTC,"BTW, the sorting at MAC is opposite of everybody else.  So if you have warm undertones, you're actually an NC.

Our skin tones are quite challenging to color/tone match as well. I'm talking NC35-50 range. Under eye & hyperpigmentation concealing is the biggest challenge IMO.

brownbeauty,2dbo1z,betafrogg,6,Tue Aug 12 10:29:17 2014 UTC,"The basics of contouring rely on principles of light and shadow; it's like painting or drawing, but on a 3D surface instead of a 2D surface.   If you want something to ""stand out,"" apply highlighter. If you want it to recede away, apply bronzer.   Think about doing a cheekbone--applying highlighter to the top of the cheekbone and bronzer to the bottom makes the cheekbone seem more prominent because it has a highlight along the top that makes it appear to stick out more, combined with a false shadow below that makes the hollow under the cheekbone seem deeper.   Combining a sharp highlight line with a sharp shadow line right next to it will make a sharp edge, like a corner edge on a desk or table. Blending more in between them will give a soft edge, like the arm of a recliner.  The reason a typical nose contour makes the nose look thinner is because it creates a false ""hard corner"" right in the middle of the nose.   Applying the highlighter in a much wider stripe, and the bronzer in much narrower stripes, will still make the bridge of the nose stand out, but won't thin it as much. You can create other effects by applying the highlighter to the tip or bulb of the nose, or on the tops of the nostrils.   My best advice--play around with it! :) Create some corners and some round surfaces in different places on your face and observe the effect. Look at your face without makeup and notice where the brightest natural highlights and the deepest natural shadows occur. You can enhance those, or cancel them out, by applying either like to like (highlight on highlight areas and shadow on shadows), or by applying opposites. The more you experiment, the more comfortable you'll become."
brownbeauty,2dbo1z,multirachael,2,Tue Aug 12 17:21:36 2014 UTC,"Thank you for this, it's really helpful. Some of it I feel like I kinda knew but flailed aimlessly at putting into practice but your concise "" You can enhance those, or cancel them out, by applying either like to like (highlight on highlight areas and shadow on shadows), or by applying opposites. "" and example with the tale and chair has helped me to focus on how to go about the sort of things I am looking to play with.   I don't use full cover, just tinted moisturiser so now I'm thinking I should get more pigmented powders and like you say, have a play. Defo taking pre and post pics will help me to see the effects.  I think part of what's influenced me to want to learn how to go 'against the rules of contouring' is this http://cvdazzle.com/ which would be on the further end of the learning curve."
brownbeauty,2dbo1z,multirachael,2,Tue Aug 12 22:07:38 2014 UTC,I majored in Theatre with a concentration in makeup design. It's crazy what you can do with just some highlight and shadow!
brownbeauty,2dbo1z,imdrowning2ohno,6,Tue Aug 12 22:37:43 2014 UTC,"Sorry this isn't very helpful, but you could always just skip the nose contouring, it shouldn't matter."
brownbeauty,2dbo1z,imdrowning2ohno,3,Tue Aug 12 10:45:43 2014 UTC,"I had considered that, but for me it's not just about not contouring the nose, but learning other ways to contour/ exaggerate different nose shapes."
brownbeauty,2dbo1z,MixxedOpinion,3,Tue Aug 12 10:55:52 2014 UTC,"Ah that makes sense. Anyone here on /r/brownbeauty can certainly understand how frustrating it can be when the ideals of beauty seem to conform to a single standard. I can't really seem to find any tutorials, I'm afraid you'll have to experiment with the principles of highlighting/contouring as outlined by /u/multirachael."
brownbeauty,2dbo1z,Cerikal,2,Tue Aug 12 20:21:11 2014 UTC,"I think Goss has something about contouring different nose shapes--still, all of them are going to be about thinning the shape of the nose to make it more narrow or hide imperfection like a crooked nose or something.   I'd also suggest looking at costume makeup...a lot of those artists end up contouring their nose to mimic certain shapes. The majority of these artists are white though, so, like with a lot of things, you'll have to learn the tips they use while also changing those tips to work for you and your client."

If you go online, like at Ulta.com, you can see some more colors for us brown girls. And they offer buy two get one half off! One bottle itself is like $13.50 online I think. I use the combination/oily formula and I've heard some women who weren't combo say they prefer that one to the normal formula too.  I also really like the Kiss New York Acne Cover and Cream Foundation. It's sort of like a MAC Studio Tech dupe. I loveee it. But I only have found it in beauty supply stores or online.  Oh Loreal True Match is good too but it is a light coverage foundation. They also only have like ONE good dark color in stores but online (again like Ulta.com or other stores) you can find a ton of darker colors.   Personally, I did not like the consistency of the IMAN creme to powder foundation. It was hard to get out of the pan and didn't go on smooth. Not worth the money in my opinion.  Edit: Ulta used to have a ton of colors for True Match. I just checked and they don't anymore.

I just purchased the Iman semi-loose powder to be my everyday powder foundation/setting powder and the color match is spot on.   If you haven't tried the Shea Moisture line and are into water-based products then thats another option however, they don't have testers and you run the cost of one high end foundation with a Shea Moisture foundation and powder, then there might be returns. Target wouldn't let me return mine. So :/   I experienced very little transfer with Fit Me and even got a decent 16hr wear on it one day, of course with primers and setting spray (Skindin√§via).

So I opt out of it. I do wonder what I'd look like with eyeshadow on though. Also, I never found a good quality bronzer that is dark enough for me, it usually ends up blending with my skin haha.  Foundations though, I always find a close match if not perfect. Some brands just really don't work for me though.  A drug store foundation that is awesome is definitely Lo'real True Match, it has a really great and broad selection on different shades.   I use it and I think it looks pretty natural, considering most people are surprised when I say I'm really into make up and usually respond with,   ""But you don't even wear any!"" When in reality I'm like, ""ohohooh, I wear a lot."""
brownbeauty,2cgr8a,khandiments,1 point,Mon Aug 4 23:17:15 2014 UTC,"The whole bronzer thing is true too. Its hard to find a good bronzer when you're dark skinned. Its also hard to find colors dark enough to contour with sometimes too.  I, also, don't tend to go for eyeshadow that much. When I do put it on its usually neutral colors buts some of the browns or blacks I have put on before either blended in too much or weren't dark enough or just faded too quickly. But I would still like to add some bright colors here and there for when I go out.   My Maybelline Fit Me usually tricks people that my skin is flawless but then I'm like lol jk"
brownbeauty,2cgr8a,khandiments,2,Mon Aug 4 23:49:13 2014 UTC,"I don't like those cream bronzers, because they usually make my face feel a bit greasy since I have already oily prone skin. I actually really want a dark enough bronzer to contour with, but I'm always out of luck."

brownbeauty,2bw19a,shady89,3,Sun Jul 27 22:07:54 2014 UTC,Haha I can't say it was easy though. I bought cream eyeliner by Elf a few months back this is the first time I've really used it. It took about and hour just for me to do the wing. I removed it all and restarted about 3 times and I used about a dozen cotton buds to clean up and change the shape until I was happy. I definitely need to practice!
brownbeauty,2bw19a,jingabobo,4,Sun Jul 27 22:20:00 2014 UTC,"Lovely! You seem to have a good hand at drawing the eyeliner and at doing this subtle style makeup really well.   Since you used the cream/gel liner, here's a tip, store the little jar upside down. It will help keep the gel from drying out. If it still dries out, just mix like half a drop of argan oil on the top surface and mix a bit.  Cheers."
brownbeauty,2bw19a,howizlife,2,Mon Jul 28 01:39:25 2014 UTC,It makes your gorgeous brown eyes pop more! I've always wished my brown eyes were that shade of brown but sadly it can rarely be distinguished from black.

brownbeauty,2bszii,I_am_medusa,2,Sat Jul 26 21:40:59 2014 UTC,I guess moisturizer would be the best thing for you. Especially one with a high SPF. Or even better a bb cream with SPF. Or both. Lol

You can see the bluish-green of her veins in her forehead and on her arms. I don't know about redness, we try to avoid heat. I know I turn VERY red when I get hot, but I don't know about her.

I'm about an NC42 and in my early 20's as well and I'm pretty much translucent on my arms and legs if I don't get a little bit of a tan. I don't seem to have any very visible veins on my face but my dark circles are here to stay no matter what i try to do. I don't get too flushed either, but most of the times when its warm, I dont even bother trying to look that cute because I will sweat most of it off anyway."
brownbeauty,2bszii,thefriendlypickle,2,Sun Jul 27 06:44:39 2014 UTC,I don't have naturally dark circles but on the days when I haven't had much sleep (life of a college student haha) it's so obvious because you can basically see through my skin.  It's much better in the summer when I have a tan. I don't even bother with wearing foundation most days.
brownbeauty,2bszii,thefriendlypickle,2,Tue Jul 29 23:48:39 2014 UTC,"I'm something like an NC35, and I have translucent skin. Something that works well for me for getting coverage is to use a Korean BB cream as a base, and then do a mix of primer, moisturizer, and liquid foundation over, and finish with a mineral powder.   I really like Skin79 Super BB cream; the hot pink formula and also the orange formula are good ones.   Be aware--it does not take much at all to do your whole face, maybe half a pump at most. It will go on really chalky-white, but you have to let it sit for 10-15 minutes and then keep blending it, and it will become more clear."
brownbeauty,2bszii,P_Grammicus,3,Sun Jul 27 19:08:43 2014 UTC,"I always thought that BB creams would be hard to match with my nc42 skin. I'm not really after a full coverage, (I like my skin showing through) but I may try these out! Thanks for the recommendation :)"

I fell in love with it because it offered me full coverage, but did not feel like that on my skin. I also loved the fact that the colour was an exact match (a rarity with WOC). I think my summer skin is more of a Cafe now, but you can't beat the fact that there are so many undertones available too.  I found it was quick drying (similar to Kat Von D lock-it), but I was still able to work with it. It covered my dark spots quite well, without the additional need for concealer. I know that there is a brush available but with quick drying/thicker formula foundations, I prefer to use my fingers to get more even coverage.  I never did buy the full product only because Becca was not available to me locally at the time and I prefer to purchase foundations in person as opposed to online.  Hope that helps!"

Also their Shimmering Skin perfector in Opal is divine as a highlighter, comes in pressed powder & liquid form.

brownbeauty,2br6i4,anne_sophie,1 point,Sun Jul 27 18:44:33 2014 UTC,I love Becca! I have quite a few things from her line including foundation and primer. I go between an NC33-NC35 at my darkest and her line offers great color options. I currently use ever matte shine proof foundation in Olive and it's my perfect match. I haven't tanned much this summer so it's sill working well into the season from winter/ spring. Paired with the ever matte primer it's an amazing combo for my oily skin. Also the foundation is very much medium coverage and can be built up. I also have the beach tints in Fig and watermelon. Perfect subtle color add ons to the cheeks. Also watermelon gives your lips such a pretty bitten look when added. I have the pressed shimmering skin perfector in Moonstone. Such a gorgeous highlight for us Olive/tanned girls. Also I have some of her glosses and they are so hydrating and non sticky. I do caution lining your lips before hand so they don't look splotchy.

brownbeauty,2bb9l5,purplepingu,1 point,Tue Jul 22 07:15:09 2014 UTC,"My HG Products at the moment (because they're always changing):  Face:  The ONLY foundation I can seem to match myself to is MAC Face and Body in C4, but its too pale for me right now, so C5 is much better. I went through my foundations and gave away anything that made me look like an orange or banana. Bourjois Healthymix in 55 is pretty good as well, but I'll have to double check that one. I'm interested in looking at BECCA foundations since I discovered her large range of olive undertone foundations, and her line caters POC very nicely!   I love my Hourglass Mineral Veil Primer since I have oily skin, but I like to layer my Fyrinnae Oil Control Finishing Powder over top for better control. This duo has been super awesome against the heat lately! But that's coming from a Canadian where I become a pool of sweat in 35 degree Celsius weather.   I'm still on the hunt for an awesome tinted setting powder, but my MAC careblend powder in Medium Dark is HG until I find something better.   HG Blush: MAC Ambering Rose, MAC Salsarose, MAC Pinch Me, Fyrinnae Bewitched, Illamasqua Supernatural (Bronze-y Rose colour, SO beautiful!), NARS Torrid, NARS Luster (really subtle, I have to pack this on to get it to show up), Fyrinnae Nordic Angel   HG Eye shadows: Currently, any Femme Fatale eye shadows, I'm a sucker for duochromes. I use MAC Chromagraphic gel liner in pure white all over my lid as a base over my Too Faced primer, nothing budges, even after 12 hours. Plus, by using a white base, lighter shades actually show up on my skin instead of disappearing into shimmer or turning ashy. MAC's matte squared shadows are really awesome too - plumage is beautiful.   Bronzers: I've tried em all, and my favourite one for an actual BRONZE glow, not gold, not peach, not orange is the Buxom Hot Escapes Bronzer in Maldives.   Additionally, Illamasqua Brow Cake in dark brown is a fantastic brow product."

It was definitely drying though and it went into my fine lines after awhile. If anything I would recommend actually buying a black lipstick if you're going to do the black lips and where them to go out, if you're talking about any sort of lip color then I'd invest in a versatile lip liner or any sort of lip liner to help the color stay on. Also I kinda find setting & prepping your lips make a huge difference when it comes to applying bold lip colors. Hopefully I was clear ahaa! :)"

You've pulled off a very strong eyelook, but maybe the balance will be better with a softer/lighter brow, and/or a lighter gold colour to highlight the inner eyes rather than the darkers eyeshadows. In my opinion the whole face is a little too intense in the eye area, and some contrast would benefit."

I've had many rough experiences so when I find someone who really tries to work with me, it seriously makes me cry.   I don't enjoy being dismissed due to my skin color. I've heard things about how I'm too dark and that they don't have any foundation for me. I was in a Sephora...and I'm not even that dark! I really just like when someone puts in the effort to find something that suits me. I've had people who give up after a few tries and then I've had amazing ones who either take me on as a challenge and use me as a learning experience or ones who are so good at color matching that they know what's going to look good! I'm not really brand loyal since I love trying new stuff but I'm seriously falling in love with MAC lipsticks.  I'd totally suggest just figuring out what colors go well with certain skin tones. I feel like so many companies focus on lighter skinned people that the rest of us have to go fend/figure it out for ourselves. Usually I just need a makeup guide!"
brownbeauty,2auq9b,presidentbaberaham,1 point,Wed Jul 16 13:27:07 2014 UTC,"that's crazy that they didn't try! I always try, I just feel bad if I can't find a match. Clinique and Lanc√¥me are better than a lot of other brands because of their shade ranges - some of my co-workers who are black just wear foundations from a different brand because the brand that they're selling literally doesn't have anything close to their shade. Our MAC counter is probably a multi-million dollar counter because not only does MAC actually have a good color selection, their sales staff are better trained.  I had one girl come in who wanted this look for a makeover and first of all, I had no clue how to do it on myself, so it was a disaster until I asked my manager to do it. Our cheek pops will show up on dark skin tones - seriously, they're awesome - and I've also used this quad (I'm personally not wild about our eyeshadow in general except for our quads, they're actually pretty good!) on a girl with dark skin. I just have no clue what to do when someone comes in wanting something specific, but I think it'll come with practice, hopefully?  You should also check out our eyeliners, some of our lipsticks (Runway Coral in particular is nice, so are Shy and Delovely), and the Chubby Stick Intense line."
brownbeauty,2auq9b,keakealani,9,Wed Jul 16 14:27:37 2014 UTC,"I don't really have specific answers to your question, but I will detail out a bad experience that may or may not have been race-based, as an anecdote for what not to do.   I'm not at all a makeup person. I browse this sub because I have no idea wtf to do, and because of that institutionalized racism in cosmetics, I have a hard time finding things that seem to work with my features. (I'm actually not very dark skinned, as I'm mixed Asian/Hawaiian with a fairly pale complexion - but my skin tone is unusual and my features are not at all white).   At the suggestion of the folks over at MUA, I got up the nerve to walk into a MAC store in my area (at the time, it was a medium-large city in Texas) - I wanted to get matched to a foundation for my wedding. I walked in with my husband (he's kind of my security blanket, as doing new things like shopping for makeup kind of freaked me out). It was moderately busy, but not ridiculous. I stood looking lost near the entrance, and tried multiple times to make eye contact with the staff and flag someone down to help me. I started looking at a few products while I waited for someone to look free to help me, but since I didn't know what I was doing, that didn't really last long. After about ten minutes of standing their like an idiot and not even getting a nod or a ""I'll help you in a minute, sorry!"" I left. (And for the record, I saw other people, who came in after me, get help from the staff, so I don't really know what's up).  I'm not sure if it was race-based, obviously noob-based, or just regular ol' bad service, but I left feeling so discouraged and invisible. I got the feeling that because I'm Asian, I wasn't as pushy as the white folks (it's really outside of my culture to be pushy and aggressive, so good luck undoing 20+ years of socialization with that), and that led to being ignored. I also wondered if nobody wanted to help me because they thought they wouldn't be able to sell me very much because of the limited selection for my skintone. Really, I don't know.   Aaaanyway, this was over a year ago and I haven't stepped food in a makeup/cosmetics store since then. I have moved back home where my racial background is normal, so I'm working up the nerve to try again with the local Sephora (which in general has been very helpful for me). But I can't say that experience at the MAC in Texas didn't lead to some serious self-esteem issues and general distaste for makeup stores, and considering it seems like the white women at MUA uniformly felt like it was no big deal to go there and get your skin tone matched, I can't help but feel that my lack of whiteness contributed to my poor experience."
brownbeauty,2auq9b,keakealani,6,Wed Jul 16 17:04:14 2014 UTC,"first of all, I'm so sorry that happened to you! that would never have happened at my store, we make sure that we greet everyone, especially people that look a little lost.  I'm not sure if it was bad service or the fact that you've been socialized to be less pushy in a retail setting. Before I worked retail I was a very vocal customer - not pushy or rude, but I was never afraid to ask questions and I usually knew what I wanted - so it's hard for me to imagine not doing that. I do feel like the ""scared/lost"" customer is only going to be overlooked at a very busy time at a very busy counter during Christmas at my store. I feel like a good salesperson can tell when someone is uncomfortable with makeup and I greet everybody - I only serve people over other people when I don't know who came in first.   That being said, MAC in my part of the country is probably different from MAC in Texas. Most of my MAC counter's customers are black women and MAC is a good company to shop with if you're a woman of color, but if you can't get good service then their shade range is pointless. It might've been unconscious racism (like they assumed you wouldn't buy anything) versus them not thinking they could match you because MAC's employees should be the best in the industry! (Key word:should)"
brownbeauty,2auq9b,leahlemon,1 point,Thu Jul 17 02:31:18 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I mean... I definitely don't want to make it seem like all cosmetics sales people are like that - and honestly, I do want to provide the benefit of the doubt that it was and off day, and maybe I was mistaken about how busy everyone was, or that particular branch just happened to have badly trained employees. So this was totally not railing on an individual store.   Quite frankly, the only reason I even bring up the specific store is because like you said - I've heard really good things about them having shades to match a lot of different skin tones, so I went there hoping I'd have more luck than the admittedly not-very-good options at the local drugstore. I'm willing to try again now that I'm in a different state with very different cultural leanings (and skin tones!) but I did hope to highlight that one issue with race and retail is that cultural miscommunication, like Asian people being less pushy (or potentially looking like they don't speak English or other stereotypes) can lead to a bad experience. Of course, I really don't think you'd do this - the fact that you're asking here means you obviously care not to make a big faux pas when it comes to cosmetics, which is awesome!"
brownbeauty,2auq9b,keakealani,2,Thu Jul 17 02:43:00 2014 UTC,"It could've been an off day or it could be that it was a bad store! Maybe it's a mix of everything, who knows? It's great that you're not turned off from the brand.  Also, I actually don't mind working with customers who have a language barrier. I often have women who have their child interpret for them which is difficult for what I do because someone in kindergarten isn't going to understand the difference between a sunscreen that you wear under makeup and one you just wear for yard work or the beach! Usually if you try your best they end up buying quite a lot, so if anything I go for these customers over my co-workers because they're often overlooked."

brownbeauty,2auq9b,rachz,7,Wed Jul 23 20:51:04 2014 UTC,"I am more than happy to work for a brand that knows about skin complexion, Make Up For Ever is the brand I fell in love with almost 14 years ago.   After many unsuccessfull attempts to buy at MAC, I noticed this brand (MUFE) and started going, and going... My makeup station was more than full when through the years I learned how to do makeup on me AND on others. Those girls believed in me and I felt more than confident to pursue in that career.   One thing I learned quickly was how to match skin complexions with anything I had in hand (ex : Flash Color Palette, create foundation with it). I suggest you to start looking back again (if you don't already rock it) at your basic color wheel. It's going to help you HELP your clients to trust you because you'll be the bomb.   A good tip I like : on a beautifull dark skin complexion I like to use something creamy as a blush, so anything like lipsticks/lip laquers, it works. You just need to explain how to set.   It is frustrating as a woman & an artist to see how many, and let's be honest girls : there's a LOT of companies out there who only serves lighter complexions. I'm very glad to work for MUFE because we carry for everyone. We just received 5 new colors of Mat Velvet in more golden tones (for medium to dark). Since it's the line that has the darkest tones (85-90) I suggest it a lot.   If you don't have dark concealers, you might try to take one of your foundations and mix it with the one that your client use. Or, orange lipstick dabbed very light with your finger, and the foundation/concealer on top. Orange cancels the ''grey'' effect. And you set!   Blogs : If you have time, read what's posted there. I know Model Mayhem is kinda weird, but on the forum there's a LOT of info and this is mainly how I started to learn/read. http://www.modelmayhem.com/po.php?thread_id=243587  I think as a makeup artist we need to be able to know what we are talking about. I will never mess with information I give when I know someone's skin might react... You can't really lie because that person is going to come back to see you, it is also nice when you know you don't have too much pressure to sell, you are there to educate anyone who wants to learn how to rock the sh*t out of their look!"
brownbeauty,2auq9b,rachz,5,Wed Jul 16 18:02:26 2014 UTC,"I've moved over to Estee Lauder for foundation, face wash, and toner. I use Bobbi Brown concealer, Urban Decay setting spray and palettes. I love to try new things.  But when i go into a beauty shop, people are standing around, and no one comes to help me. If i go to the counter, it seems like the last one to move away is the one that gets stuck helping me. Usually i only get good service only if another WoC is working that day. I ask for help finding concealer or eyeshadow and they say they have no idea what could work with my skin. Bitch, colors look better on dark skin! And as for concealer, if you don't know what colors work to hide dark spots and what kind of undertones your makeup works best with, how are you working?   I want to know the same thing everyone does. I want to know which ones are better for my type of skin (oily tzone, normal everywhere else). I want to know which brush is better for blending this particular liquid foundation. I really want to know if the new palettes are worth buying! Is this lipstick waxy or smooth? How does this eyeliner match up to the old formula? Is that brush cleaner a good buy or will i have to use a whole bunch to clean one brush? Normal stuff."

brownbeauty,2anod9,snitchandhomes,3,Mon Jul 14 10:55:43 2014 UTC,"well technically you could use everything for everything    The easiest way to go about this I think is to play around with what you have. Start with small amounts on a brush/your fingers and see how you go blending under the cheekbones/sides of the nose etc. I do definitely think you can pull off a contour with the Bobbi Brown foundation though.     As far as the eye brightener goes.. isn't that just a fancy way to say it's an under eye concealer? So just swipe/dab it on the under eye area/where your eyebags are and then blend... that said, I don't know if it has enough warm tones to neutralise potential dark circles? I guess that depends on how pigmented your dark circles are.     I'm not sure about the YSL product since it isn't blended, but you might be able to subtly highlight with that? Cheekbones/bridge of the nose etc. As for the Estee Lauder product... well if you ever end up getting a further tan, there's always that lol"

But basically all I do is take an angled brush with a matte brown eyeshadow (covergirl brown smolder is my HG powder) and fill them in. If I have any sort of sparse areas I usually take my wet' n wild brow pencil in Dark brown & fill in those areas. Then finally I finally brush it all out with a spooly!

brownbeauty,2a5c0y,was_ben_there,2,Wed Jul 9 00:39:53 2014 UTC,"Eyes   Eyebrows: Used the bottom right dark brown on this Body Shop Eye Palette in 01 Smoky Brown  I bought this in-store in Canada for $10 around the post Christmas liquidation sale time, and it's amazing! Very pigmented, comparable to Naked 1 I'd say. The link is for the Indonesian Body Shop site, since I can't find it on the main one. Sorry! The matte dark brown colour is perfect for filling in my brows and stays all night. Highlighter under Eyebrow: Urban Decay Eyeshadow in Virgin (from the Naked 1 Palette) Base: NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil in Milk Eye Shadow: BH Cosmetics, Take Me To Brazil palette Tight-lining & outer waterline: MAC Powerpoint Eye Pencil in Engraved Eyeliner: Lakme Insta-Liner | Water-Resistant Eyeliner  This stuff is seriously SO amazing, ease of application of a liquid eyeliner, love, love, love the applicator, and the black intensity of a gel eyeliner when it dries. Get your hands on this!! Eyelash Curler: Shisheido Eyelash Curler Mascara: Wet N Wild Megaclear Brown & Lash Mascara as a base then Revlon Grown Luscious Plumping Mascara Contacts: FreshLook One-Day Color Contact Lenses in Gray Under-eye primer/brightener: Revlon Photoready Eye Primer + Brightener Under-eye corrector & concealer: Vasanti Cosmetics Wonders of the World Concealer in O2  Oh. My. God. You guys. I'm not kidding when I say I've tried Bobbi Brown's Corrector in Peach & this beats it BY FAR. This is NOT a dupe. It is in a whole other league of its own. This, topped with the concealer that comes next to it, does not crease, does not fade, blends easily & seamlessly, covers anything & everything, and for so cheap. You have got to try this at least once, especially if you struggle with under-eye dark circles. I have horrible ones that never go away, and this stuff is my HOLY GRAIL!   Face   Primer/Base/BB Cream: MISSHA M Perfect Cover BB Cream in #31 (Golden Beige) Light dusting of powder foundation for setting: MAC Studio Fix Powder Plus Foundation in NC43  (didn't link to Amazon here since they all look like fake sellers!) Contouring: Maybelline Shine-Free Fit Me Foundation Stick in 355 (Coconut) (The darkest one they had at the drugstore haha!) & elf Bronzer in Warm, I use the bottom right colour for contouring. Highlighter: Benefit Cosmetics Watt's Up Blush: Wet N Wild Color Icon Blusher in 834E (Berry Shimmer)   Lips   Lip Liner:NYX Lipliner Pencil in 828 (Ever), an apparent dupe for MAC Lip Pencil in Spice (Bollywood actresses recommend this all the time, but didn't want to spend the money before trying out the dupe, and man, after my NYX is done, I'm trying out the MAC version) Lip Gloss: Elizabeth Arden Beautiful Color Luminous Lip Gloss in Royal Plum I actually got this in a package of 4 from my boyfriend's brother for Christmas, I wasn't really that much into glosses at the time, I always had a bad experience of my hair sticking to my lips, smudging, etc, etc. This is perfect though; it stays in place, great nude colour for my pigmented lips, just the right amount of shine without looking trashy, and no hair stickiness. I would spend $24 to get another one to be honest. Love, love, love this!"

brownbeauty,2a41if,mochalolita,18,Tue Jul 8 03:22:13 2014 UTC,"Hi!  :D  Access to a selection of makeup for brown skin totally depends on the area you live in, to be honest.    Some areas with denser black populations have black opal and other makeup brands that cater to our skin, so it's easier to find shades that match the unique undertones better.    But you can also order things online (drugstore.com is a great option) or go to the drugstore and speak to the manager about carrying darker shades.     Pre and post-makeup skincare is the most important thing of all to focus on, since the healthier your skin is underneath, the less makeup needed and the smoother it will adhere to the skin.    Google 'Paula's choice' and take a look at some things you can do to create/maintain good skincare habits that will prep the skin for makeup.  It all may seem overwhelming at first, but the site is helpful for sorting through products that don't do anything for your skin at all, and products that actually do work.   So in terms of makeup, primer will really help if her skin is oily.  The monostat chaffing gel is considered a dupe for the smashbox primer and goes on after cleansing and moisturizing skin, but before makeup.  (drugstore, feminine aisle)  Tools are also super important in how easily the makeup will apply, and how nice the end result looks.  It's good to invest in different types of tools to apply the different products correctly.    For cheap brushes that work well, the elf studio and regular brush lines are great for beginners.  If you want to splurge go for the real tecnique brushes sold at walgreens, or ecotools brushes.    The beautyblender (you can find it on amazon) is the best thing for applying foundation flawlessly.  But I really love it because its a multitasker.  You can apply blush and other things with it as well, which is awesome!   Keep your brushes/beautyblender clean with the Dr. Bronner's bar soap (you can find it in the natural section at the drugstore).  You can't go wrong with the loreal true match foundations.  They have a great selection of shades and most drugstore accept returns even on opened bottles!  The maybelline fit me foundations are also a great drugstore find, as is the revlon colorstay for oily skin, the covergirl queen 3-in-1 line, and the black opal foundation sticks if you can find them.    For concealer I like the l.a girls pro concealer, although it can be kinda hard to find.  The drugstore doesn't offer many good concealers for brown skin but I'm pretty sure loreal has a few that may work. (beauty supply stores)  For eyebrows pretty much any brow pencil will work, I tend to use the jordana one with the little brush end, but I hear maybelline define a brow works as well as the milani one with the spoolie.  You can also use plain eyebrow gel if your brows are thick enough. (drugstores)   Eye primer wise, elf makes a good one as well as miliani and the fergie by wet and wild line.    Lips wise I like to use the aquaphor lip treatment (it's in a tube) overnight, and in the morning my favorite lipsticks to apply are the newest milani ones in the gold tubes.    For less expensive lipstick, the wet and wild megalast ones are great as well.  There are so many lipsticks that are great at the drugstore.  (drugstores)  If you aren't a lipstick person, the revlon colorbursts and lip butters are great.   The wet and wild fergie lipgloss/stain hybrids are wonderful as well as the revlon chubby pencil balm things. (walgreens, cvs, etc.)  Blush wise milani has it on lock AGAIN.  Lol.  Choose whatever color you like and its gonna be pigmented.  For something cheaper try the wet and wild blushes, elf's hd blush, or nyx blushes. (any drugstore)   Eyeliner and mascara wise Jordana's fabuliners and extreme mascara are all great.  (walgreens)  Or if you're into liquid liner, Lineur Intense Brush Tip Liquid Eyeliner by loreal is really black and shows up well.  For gel liner the elf black cream liner and the studio angled brush work great together.    Last but not least to set your makeup, you can either opt for more coverage and use the loreal true match pressed powder that matches the foundation, or you can use a translucent powder like the elf studio.  Be sure to grab oil blotting toweletes from either elf or clean and clear throughout the day so you don't keep putting more powder on your skin in case she gets shiny!  Hope this helps a bit. :D"
brownbeauty,2a41if,frumperbell,8,Tue Jul 8 08:11:23 2014 UTC,"You sound like the Best Sister!  Here's a bunch of different options in case some things are hard to find.  All of them you can order online if you strike out in store.  I personally like drugstore.com and amazon.    Companies that cater to women with darker skin tones that you may not have heard of:   Black Radiance Black Opal Iman Cosmetics Milani Cosmetics   Mainstream Companies with lines that cater to darker skintones:   CoverGirl's TruBlend  CoverGirl Queen Revlon L'Oreal True Match Maybelline Fit Me   What I would personally put in a starter kit:  Foundation   Revlon ColorStay Combo/Oily CoverGirl Queen 3 in 1  CoverGirl TruBlend L'Oreal True Match Super Blendable   Primer   Black Radiance Shine Control Primer ELF Mineral Infused Face Primer   Concealer   LA Girl Pro Concealer Black Opal Spot & Scar Eraser   Finishing Powder   Black Opal Invisible Oil Blocking Loose Powder Maybelline Fit Me Pressed Powder   Blush   Milani Baked Blush in Bella Rosa, Rose D'Oro, Red Vino, & Corallina Black Radiance Blush in Toasted Almond & Warm Berry NYX Powder Blush in Cinnamon & Pinched   Mascara   CoverGirl LashBlast Fusion and Clump Crusher Maybelline The Falsies, Anything but Great Lash   Brows   Wet n Wild ColorIcon Pencil in Mink Brown  Rimmel Pro Brow Pencil in Black Brown   Eyeliner   Wet n Wild ColorIcon Pencil NYX Slim Eye Pencil Milani Ultrafine L'Oreal Lineur Intense   Eyeshadow   Wet n Wild Comfort Zone 8 Pan Palette Black Radiance Downtown Browns & Urban Jungle 8 Pan Palette   Lipliner   Milani NYX Slim Lip Pencil   Brushes   ELF Studio (the black handle ones) Real Techniques EcoTools   I'm skipping a rec for a lipstick because almost every company makes shades that will look good.  It's more a matter of IMO playing around and seeing what colors look good/your sis prefers to wear.  I will say that lip liner is super important for WOC as we tend to have pigmented lips.  A good way to use liner is to find one that either A) matches the lipstick shade or B) is a mlbb shade for her and then use it to fill in the entire lip before applying lipstick.  A good brand to play around with color though is Wet n Wild.  The ones that come in the black bullet are $2 and while matte, have a great shade range.  If it's a little drying for your sis, tell her to put a lip balm down first.    As far as her acne scarring and oily complexion, send her to /r/SkincareAddiction.  I probably have similar skin issues and after implementing stuff I learned over there, I have the clearest skin I've had since before I hit puberty.    P.S.  When your sister is ready for some Next Level Shit like contouring, get her this.  It'll take awhile to show up since it's coming from the UK, but it's totally worth the wait."

Dark matte powder eye shadow (for brows), cream stick eye shadow in a ""nude"" shade just lighter than my skin (for brow bones and eyelids), one warm nude-ish shimmer shade powder shadow, gel liner pencil, liquid liner, mascara.

I have one question: how do you like the Benefit Watt's Up highlighter? I've been searching for highlighters for so long that I'm pulling out my hair at this point, haha. I'm trying to choose between Watt's up and Ben Nye's Banana powder. I don't know which one to bite the bullet on."
brownbeauty,29ome4,magicalfriendshiphat,1 point,Thu Jul 3 06:34:02 2014 UTC,"I love Watt's Up it makes it so easy to get a glow and blends nicely on bare skin and over powder and liquid foundations. I have Ben Nye Banana Powder too, but I use each product differently. The Banana Powder is a powder(duh) so it gives a matte finish and I personally use it to set my undereye concealer or if i'm highlighting with a lighter foundation/concealer I would use the Banana Powder to set that. Basically the Banana Powder highlights by making the area lighter/yellower depending on how heavily you apply it, but it won't give you a glow/dewy look. Watt's Up is creamier since its in a stick and gives skin a luminous look without any actual glitter in it. Watt's Up is also less pink than most cream/stick highlighters I've tried without being actually gold (perfect for brown skin!). I only use Watt's Up to highlight my cheeks/cupids bow and wouldn't use it in the way that I use the Banana Powder to brighten the center of my face. This ended up being super long but I hope that helped, they are both great products, just depends on what type of look you're going for. If you have any other questions I'd be glad to help!"

If I feel I need to exfoliate, I use a Konjac sponge to remove, or else I just wash with water. The Face Shop Rice Water Brightening Foam Cleanser. This leaves my face with a squeaky clean feel which I actually don't like on it's own because it's drying, but then I follow it up with a mineral oil massage every couple of days i use Queen Helene Julep Mint Masque, followed by another mineral oil massage to basically vacuum out all the dirt from my pores use a cloth soaked with warm water to remove any excess oil usually don't need any moisturizer. it's summer so my skin hasn't been too dry, but this may change in the winter BONUS: if i have any pimples (usually stress-breakouts), i dab them with a bit of tea tree oil (diluted!).   Day   because my nighttime routine is so extensive, i usually only need to just splash my face with cold water to wake myself up and wash away any nasty eye crust spf and moisturizer and i'm ready for my make up :)"

Just find some Youtube tutorials on your brows and you'll figure out in no time the shape and fill level you like.  If you are getting enough sleep, then I would suggest finding an eye cream for puffy eyes. I know clinique has a few products. I currently use their dark circles serum and I have noticed a difference (not as much difference as when I consistently sleep 8 hours but still good).   Lastly, do your best to never post to anything like that. You have to realize that your audience is mostly a group of people who want to judge someone on their looks based upon a few static photos."

brownbeauty,28k2pe,jingabobo,1 point,Thu Jun 19 16:52:14 2014 UTC,"If you are not familiar with the dipbrow like formula, I'd suggest to start with the elf eyebrow duo, it is $3 and a great starter kit for eyebrow pomade styling.  The dipbrow is a wonderful but intense product that takes a while to master and get the correct color, its very easy to go groucho with it. :(  So first master the technique, the brush strokes, the blending with a spoolie etc with a more subtle product like the elf one and then move on to the Dipbrow.  Of course, if you feel you have a good control of hand or are artfully inclined you may just master the dipbrow in no time. :)"

I think playing around with your eyebrows will definitely help your face look more complete. It'll also give your face a focal point on the upper half. Have you tried lining your bottom waterline?

You don't have to use much at all, the girl at MAC used ALOT and I was nervous buying it, but I'm so happy I did. That one is a little pricier at around $25.

And don't forget to get new ones after awhile ( six months for me)  -sometimes it's true: you get what you pay for. If the cheap stuff isn't working, bite the bullet and buy the expensive stuff. On the other hand, cheap isn't always crap."
brownbeauty,27mtf6,Cerikal,2,Tue Jun 10 02:04:27 2014 UTC,"if you're unsure about whether or not to buy a product, or if it will work for your skin tone/type, try a quick google or reddit search! seriously this has been such a help when wondering whether to bite the bullet on an expensive product/tool, or to find a cheaper dupe. more often than not, someone has had the same question filling in your brows, even subtly, makes a HUGE difference. i never thought i needed it at all because my eyebrows are quite thick and dark, but even lightly filling them in with powder makes a huge difference (especially with glasses or a bold eye look) flawless makeup starts with good skin! keep healthy, and drink lots of water. also something that's made a HUGE difference for me is realizing how to take care of my skin. /r/skincareaddiction is great for help with this. i used to think my skin was oily, and used all these anti-oily/mattifying products, but it just caused my skin to be even oilier! since adjusting my skincare routine, my skin has that natural dewy look, and never looks cakey, and i don't need as much to make it look 'flawless' this may be a personal preference, but try to opt for products that are buildable in pigment or coverage. they tend to be the most natural looking and also has major staying power. i find that the beauty blender does a great job of buffing out my foundation and i can build up the coverage as needed, and it doesn't look cakey or streaky like it does with my fingers speaking of cake-face makeup... FIX+ spray by MAC. omg this has been such a game-changer. a little goes such a long way, and leaves you with a sheer dewy look every time. if i'm lazy in the morning sometimes i'll just spritz a bit on my face and brush on some powder foundation on top. you can use it to apply eyeshadows wet for more staying power. man this stuff is amazing. i've definitely seen a cheaper DIY recipe floating around, but i haven't tried it myself. moisturize and exfoliate your lips! it makes lipstick application a lot easier, and it looks prettier too. especially if you're using matte shades, which can be drying, you want to have a smooth canvas to work on."

brownbeauty,27kw7z,ripeturtle,6,Sat Jun 7 22:54:33 2014 UTC,"Here are some swatches in my foundation collection. I tan very easily so I can get pretty dark, but lately I've been indoors most of the time and religiously wear sunscreen. This photo was taken after about 15 minutes of oxidation.  Product list:   Urban Decay Naked Skin - 7.0 Skin79 BB Cream - Bronze NARS Tinted Moisturizer - Annapurna NARS Sheer Glow - Tahoe MUFE HD - 173 Urban Decay Naked Skin - 8.0 Bobbi Brown Long Wear - 5.5 Warm Honey Bobbi Brown Long Wear - 6 Golden Smashbox BB Cream - Medium/Dark MAC Studio Sculpt - NC44"

brownbeauty,27kw7z,gigizulei,2,Sun Jun 8 01:25:56 2014 UTC,"I would say the Bobbi Brown in 5.5 matches the best for me right now. I also have the foundation stick in 5.5 (forgot to swatch); it's a bit more yellow than the liquid and matches me perfectly. As for NARS TM Annapurna, it gets pretty orange and dark which is weird because it's only listed at Med 2.   I don't have a swatch of it, but the new MAC MSFN in Medium Tan is perfect for NC43 as a setting powder! I found Medium Dark to be too pink for me and this one has just enough warmth in it."
brownbeauty,27kw7z,Jansi_Ki_Rani,3,Sun Jun 8 01:46:58 2014 UTC,I use bobbi brown in 5.5 as well. I've found that it has a great texture and finish but for some reason I think the NC43 powder/foundation matches my skin color more.

However, KYY leaves a nice stain on the lips so it doesn't look very crazy when it does fade."

There was ONE on YouTube; had a girl speaking Spanish, which I don't understand haha!  For reference, I'm an NC43 in MAC studio Fix Powder Foundation. I'm using Missha Perfect in #31 too, I was told #27 would be better because I have yellow/olive undertones, but haven't tried it yet (if anyone has, please do share!). The #31 starts out kind of grey, but after some oxidisation, it looks decent, not a perfect match, but decent. And you're absolutely right, using a slight dusting of my powder foundation on top makes it match perfectly.  If you still have the Skin79 Bronze, would you be willing to do a quick swatch of it? Pictures would be amazing. Thanks!"

I've tried Missha #27 before and it was too light for me so I'm pretty sure it'll be too light for you.  My best guess is that it's made for someone around an NC35.  Unfortunately I used up my samples of the skin79 bronze, but you can get 3 samples for like $5 on prettyandcute.  Although if you're an NC43 I really think the color would match you well :)"

brownbeauty,25vn5u,CopperFeel,7,Sun May 18 18:35:28 2014 UTC,"Hi there! From my impression, Lolita makeup (and the lolita look in general) is based on large eyes, pale skin and muted cheeks, right? Is there a reference you feel comfortable sharing so that we can make suggestions?  If you're looking to do a lolita look on someone of mixed race, first ask them what foundation they typically use. Lighter foundations on darker/olive skin really looks funky, so I'd work on getting that pale look from highlighting rather than actually doing a whole face lighter.   The large eyes are really the same across the board. Make her crease higher than it normally is, accentuate the waterline with white/neutral eyeliner and put on bottom lashes past where you would normally put them on in order to show that the eyes are bigger. Kind of like this here That's promise phan and she's got great tutorials on ""anime eyes""   Also you might try circle lenses to make her irises larger. Is she comfortable wearing that?"
brownbeauty,25vn5u,chiffonandheels,2,Sun May 18 20:28:23 2014 UTC,Yeah I think so. I'll talk your suggestions over with her. Thanks so much!
brownbeauty,25vn5u,chiffonandheels,2,Sun May 18 21:56:10 2014 UTC,"No problem! If you do choose to go with a lighter foundation, really try to contour her neck and jawline along with her forehead more than her cheeks. The lighter foundation shouldn't continue to her neck or scalp line."
brownbeauty,25vn5u,moisanom,1 point,Sun May 18 22:23:01 2014 UTC,"Ok, thanks!"
brownbeauty,25vn5u,moisanom,3,Sun May 18 22:35:04 2014 UTC,"What kind of Lolita style are you guys going for? There is so many different styles that are all quite different. Lolita is all about looking like a doll, so skin color is really not an issue as long as it looks flawless. I would just google some lolita looks and see what you guys like. Use her own foundation and everything else is pretty much the same. Depending on her skin color some eye shadows, blushes or lipsticks might not show up so well but there is always primers that make them pop. As a fellow biracial woman make up artist and Lolita fan I am happy to answer any more questions. By the way is this for a special occasion or something? How elaborate are you guys going for?"
brownbeauty,25vn5u,moisanom,1 point,Tue May 20 16:52:13 2014 UTC,"I think she wants sweet lolita, so I'm a little concerned about using pink and white eyeshadow and whether it'll show up on her skin, since every tutorial has used those colours - but all those tutorials are with white or Asian skin tones, so should I use a similar colour to her skin tone instead? And we're going for a trip up to Camden, which is pretty alternative so i think I have free reign haha  Thanks!"
brownbeauty,25vn5u,moisanom,3,Tue May 20 19:29:42 2014 UTC,"what is her skin shade approximately? I never had any problem using pinks, you can make a great mix of softer pink mixed in with brighter fuchsias which can look amazing! I highly recommend sleek eye shadows. they are super pigmented and show up on darker skin. I wouldn't use any white shadows though it might not looks so nice, use a light beige or a light pink instead. the good thing is that most biracial people have the kind of skin tone and hair that fits with almost every color. so there is not much you can do wrong. just dont try to go lighter then her neck is otherwise it will look weird. Also contouring with matte bronzer in combination with blush will make her look more natural and dolly"
brownbeauty,25vn5u,thelittlestsakura,1 point,Tue May 20 19:35:56 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure about her skin tone - I do know that she usually uses the darkest shade of 'white skin' foundation as she puts it.  That sounds great, I'll check out some Sleek eyeshadows, thanks for the suggestions!"
brownbeauty,25vn5u,thelittlestsakura,1 point,Tue May 20 19:38:02 2014 UTC,"yeah sounds close to my experiences. I think it should be best to use her own face products she already own. Like foundation concealer etc... If she doesnt have her own powder and you use yours, try it out on her skin before applying the rest to make sure it blends in well and doesnt make her look chalky.  But yeah good luck, Im sure it will be super fun!"

brownbeauty,25elj9,Muficita,2,Tue May 13 02:01:28 2014 UTC,"Not really commenting about colour, more about affordability - have you checked out any independent makeup companies? Shiro and Darling Girl are a couple that sell really beautiful loose shadows at a fraction of the cost, and the nice thing is that you can try samples or minis for a buck or two. I think with your colouring you could get away with a lot of gorgeous bright or dark colours and the indie makers have very unique shades. Check out /r/indiemakeupandmore for reviews and swatches."
brownbeauty,257joy,forgetfulcat,5,Sat May 10 14:43:43 2014 UTC,Love the lorac unzipped palette. Mattes and shimmers and an awesomr amount.
brownbeauty,257joy,recycledpaper,6,Sat May 10 17:14:16 2014 UTC,Seconding this. It's gorgeous on medium skin and is a mix of matte and shimmer. The pans are quite big as well.
brownbeauty,257joy,Geekyisland,1 point,Sat May 10 18:14:30 2014 UTC,This palette is flippin amazing! I'm a medium-dark skintone with yellow undertones and the colours are so flattering on my skin. They blend so well and there is a good enough range of different shades that you can create heaps of looks. I would pick the lorac unzipped over naked 1.
brownbeauty,257joy,so_fluffay,5,Mon May 12 06:00:09 2014 UTC,Try the Lorac PRO palette. It's got an even mix between matte and shimmer shades and it's quite flattering on brown girls.
brownbeauty,257joy,chiffonandheels,7,Sat May 10 17:26:26 2014 UTC,"I got the Too Faced Natural Eye palette (new version) about a month ago, and I love it! I've used it every single day so far, and it's great for many different neutral looks. The shadows are very pigmented and soft, last all day with a primer, and it's only $36.

brownbeauty,257joy,princessology,1 point,Sun May 11 12:22:06 2014 UTC,Ohh. This intrigues me. I'm head over heels for my Naked 3 palette. I may have to swatch the chocolate bar palette soon.
brownbeauty,257joy,ravvie,3,Tue Jun 10 00:31:23 2014 UTC,I adore the Chocolate Bar and consider it pretty much perfect for the my neutral eye!
brownbeauty,257joy,ishotthepilot,2,Sat May 10 20:29:18 2014 UTC,"I really, really loved my Naked2 palette. I was afraid it was too neutral and wouldn't show up on my skin (I am about the same shade as Eva as well) but every single color looks great."
brownbeauty,257joy,TheDangerousLesbian,2,Sat May 10 16:40:52 2014 UTC,"I love the Naked 3 palette, but smashbox has one that I've been eyeing for quite sometime. It has half matte and half shimmer colors I believe."
brownbeauty,257joy,LaFemmeFatale24,2,Sat May 10 17:06:58 2014 UTC,"I have a similar skin tone, and I think naked 1 has the best colours for it. However, I use a combo of naked 1 and 2 for my eye makeup. If I had to pick only one of them, I'd go with naked 1"
brownbeauty,257joy,palster,2,Sat May 10 19:04:44 2014 UTC,"I bought and returned naked 1 and 2. The naked 1 was slightly better but the shadows looked like a silvery mess on me. If you stand back from the naked 2 its really hard to see the differences in the mid tone shades so it's not surprising that they are hard to distinguish on the eye. Also the highlight colors were too light. I think the only reason they look so awesome on tutorials is because the pic is usually super close up. You can see the differences up close. Although if you are lighter then maybe these would still work for you. I'm more of a tan.  I got the Kat Von D Chrysalis palette in the orange. I like it because there is a mix of matte and sparkle, the shadows themselves are super soft and blendable but not chalky like the Lorac pro palette. The colors are wearable but contrast-y enough that I don't feel like I paid $50 for 12 of the basically the same color.The reviews on Sephora were all really high and some of them were talking about how it's like basics but a little more fun and I agree."
brownbeauty,257joy,Wafflefart,2,Sat May 10 20:42:57 2014 UTC,Naked 1 or Kat Von D Monarch
brownbeauty,257joy,glaceauglaceau,2,Sat May 10 23:33:23 2014 UTC,I love my Naked 3 palette. If she prefers pink colored shadows then this would definitely be a good choice :)
brownbeauty,257joy,costcosampleslover,2,Sun May 11 09:29:21 2014 UTC,"Chocolate Bar is absolutely perfect, don't need any white base, colors show up, it stays on, blend like a dream and smell delicious!  I also highly recommend the Lorac Pro & theBalm NudeTude. I like Tarte shadows too but nearly every damn palette is Limited Edition!  Naked 3 was a waste of money for me, it just does not show up without a white base and the shadow textures are very clumpy. Liar and Mugshot are the only colors I like.  It looks good on lighter or even darker skin tones because they don't need a base for the colors to pop. But for say an NC#44 like me, it is frustrating to try & use N3 casually."

brownbeauty,255qxc,pr0pane_accessories,1 point,Fri May 9 22:15:21 2014 UTC,Really? I woulnt expect it. Generally these type (not pencil/ cone shaped) kajals are disappointing for me. Like Lotus and Lakme.   Are you sure?
brownbeauty,255qxc,ilahii,2,Sat May 10 04:40:03 2014 UTC,Shahnaz Husain smudges badly for me and gets harder to use as it gets blunter...not sure I would recommend it. I've heard good things about Colorbar.
brownbeauty,255qxc,jingabobo,1 point,Wed May 28 10:38:37 2014 UTC,"Because Kajal is worn on the waterline it's bound to come off soon. You can wipe your waterline with a Qtip first, apply a little eyeshadow primer & concealer in that area. Then apply the Kajal. It will stay on a liiitle bit longer than usual. I like the bourgeois Kajal and the Stila waterproof eye pencil."
brownbeauty,255qxc,jingabobo,1 point,Fri May 9 23:32:07 2014 UTC,But I have friends whose kajal stays on through the day! Mine literally wont last 20 minutes.   I really dislike the idea of primer and concealer (I like being really low maintainance.) but I'll try Bougeios and Stila. Thanks!
brownbeauty,255qxc,Soan,3,Sat May 10 04:38:51 2014 UTC,"Could also be that your eyes water a bit more? Mine do water a bit more than others and my Kajal comes off in about 3 hours.  Also remember that anything that is formulated to be long wearing contains a lot more harsher chemicals, so reapplying might be a better option."
brownbeauty,255qxc,narwhool,0,Sat May 10 14:23:18 2014 UTC,Wow I never thought of that. Is is true though? That everything that's 'long-lasting' etc has stronger chemicals?

brownbeauty,253d3b,oldhaunts_,3,Fri May 9 02:15:50 2014 UTC,"I forgot to tag this as a cross post to /r/MakeupAddiction[1] . Someone else asked me this question there, so I'll copy, paste my answer.   By itself, it doesn't last very long. I have oily, acne prone skin and was already getting shiny about two hours after applying. At the end of the day, my blemishes were more apparent but still toned down compared to if I wasn't wearing anything at all. I think by itself, it would be best suited for dry or normal skin. People with oily skin could probably add a few more hours of wear with a good primer and powder.  Coverage is light to medium and is buildable."

brownbeauty,24xwi8,Lets_play_numberwang,6,Wed May 7 10:27:29 2014 UTC,"If foundations are always too orange or too pink you probably have neutral undertones. I bought a lot of the wrong foundation with the same result because the girls at the counters always saw me and said tan = yellow undertone and then I would buy something that looked too orange.   The L'oreal True Match line has a neutral range. The girl in the ads in America is Frieda Pinto (the girl who played Latika in Slumdog Millionaire) and she is an N4. I haven't tried it yet because the bottle looks a tad light for me and the next shade down looks off for another reason, I can't remember now. Maybe too pink? In any case it's in the $10 range so it's at least a good place to start.   Do you guys have something like Sephora? They do a color match with a little machine that worked ok on me. It recommended Tarte Amazonian clay foundation in Tan Honey. The list price here is $38 and it says it lasts for 12 hours. I can't tell if I am lighter or darker than Rita Ora so I might be about the same shade too. I'm NC42 in Mac if that helps.  If it is available, RCMA has a wide range of colors from light to deep and yellow, pink, or olive undertones. I got the color Shinto II which has only a slight yellow undertone. RCMA is apparently widely used by makeup artists and highly pigmented. The jar was $26.  Finally, if you have a lot of foundations that are the wrong color, you could try mixing them all up. I thought of this after hearing a story where a guy wanted to know how smart a group was so he took all the guesses for a ""guess the weight of an elephant"" contest and even though individually they could be way off, when averaged all together the guesses were only off of the actual weight by a pound or something. So what I am saying is that even though all your foundations may be wrong, it might be that they are all only a little bit wrong and also wrong in different ways so that if you mixed them all up they might be right."
brownbeauty,24xwi8,Wafflefart,1 point,Wed May 7 22:36:16 2014 UTC,"Thank you so much for taking time to write this reply, its ever so helpful. Im definitely going to look into it all, true match seems to be the general consensus. I currently get by currently by mixing shades, but the colour is a little off and I look a bit weird in pictures and bright sunlight, also the foundation seems to go patchy and almost dirty in some places after about 2 hours.   also I love your username."
brownbeauty,24xwi8,Wafflefart,2,Thu May 8 07:33:11 2014 UTC,thanks you're sweet! I'm 36 and still haven't found the foundation I would buy a second time. I think it is a life-long quest. :/
brownbeauty,24xwi8,chiffonandheels,3,Sat May 10 20:46:53 2014 UTC,"What kind of foundation are you willing to shell out money for? High end, drugstore? I know that Boots has a huge selection of drugstore products.  Here are some brands that have good olive/yellow undertones:   Makeup Forever Bobbi Brown Revlon Colorstay line L'Oreal True Match Covergirl Clean   I hope this helps a little bit!

I am also biracial but light skinned, I swithc around between a mac shade nc 25 to nc 45 but i never found foundations i was satisfied with since they never seemed to match my skin properly. as you said too pink too orange, too light etc... i used to use loreals mineral foundation for a while. it is a powder with makes skin look gorgeous, their shade was a very good fit and you can wear it sheer of build it up, it is also long lasting. you could also have a look at sleek. i have never tried their foundations but their contouring is a perfect match for my skin. also have you ever tried a bb cream from korea? misshas bb cream in #23 or #27 might be perfect for you. it feels very nice on the skin, looks natural and long lasting."

brownbeauty,23x359,cron_nin,3,Fri Apr 25 18:37:27 2014 UTC,I think I'm about your skin tone and I use the brown one as well. I like that they don't look soooo dark so my eyes remain the focal point.   I think it's personal preference though since I think either can work on darker skin tones (the brown is really dark).

brownbeauty,23s3jd,syaami,1 point,Thu Apr 24 21:59:40 2014 UTC,Do you feel like that's a good match for your skin tone? I'm the exact same shade as you and have been considering using a BB cream for a while now!
brownbeauty,23s3jd,moisanom,1 point,Fri Apr 25 20:55:39 2014 UTC,"Yup! It's really not much coverage though, I should warn you. I feel like my Nars TM in Cuba is more coverage. It is wayyyy more expensive though."
brownbeauty,23s3jd,wolme,1 point,Sat Apr 26 03:34:58 2014 UTC,I didn't even know this was a place.
brownbeauty,23s3jd,unwantedsyllables,3,Thu May 8 00:25:40 2014 UTC,"If you're looking for light coverage, the Ponds Luminous Finish one is pretty good. It works well on my dry skin (although if you have oily skin it might not be the best for you). I really like it when I have little time and want to slap on something quickly. It does make my skin look more awake (my skin is what shows how much sleep I've had.) I'm the shade ""Toast"" in Revlon Colorstay (around NC 40-42 I think) and this blends pretty well on my skin.   The Missha M Perfect Cover in #31 (or #27 depending on your skin tone) is the darkest Asian BB cream I've found. The #31 doesn't seem to have enough yellow tones for me though. So if you plan on getting this, you will probably have to mix it with something yellower or powder with something that will blend it more with your skintone."

brownbeauty,23s3jd,cali5795,2,Thu Apr 24 16:01:27 2014 UTC,I use Maybelline BB Cream in Dark.
brownbeauty,23s3jd,cali5795,2,Wed Apr 23 23:28:50 2014 UTC,"I literally just went shopping for CC/BB creams with my sister who is NC45/47. Overall, we found that higher end brands (it cosmetics, pur minerals, tarte, too faced, etc..) had fewer shades of their creams, which ended up in the creams having super pink undertones == ashy ashy ashy. NYX has an awesome tinted moisturizer series that comes in a variety of undertones. They're a bit more sheer than a BB cream, but layered, they're quite nice."
brownbeauty,23s3jd,cali5795,2,Thu Apr 24 03:10:09 2014 UTC,I really liked Dior nude bb cream in dark (or deep). Go to sephora and try it out!

Maybelline Dream Fresh BB in Medium-Deep blends into my skin so well that you can barely even tell it's there. It's very light on my skin and definitely well worth the price for me."

I recently discovered thefancyfaced and she's awesome.  She just did a video on her foundation shade matches and I believe she's about an NC45.  Karen from Makeup and Beauty Blog is NC42, so I usually look at her swatches before I purchase anything.  Another channel I've recently subscribed to is YazMakeUpArtist.  I'm not sure what foundation shade she wears, but I'm sure she's mentioned it in a video.  And she's a little lighter, but I also like Ariel Hope.  She's about an NC35.

There's also a color called Mourning by Detrivore cosmetics that's a pretty good matte lid shade, though I find it a bit hard to work with."
brownbeauty,23mdqx,optogirl,20,Mon Apr 21 20:56:05 2014 UTC,I would get two colors and make the perfect color!
brownbeauty,23mdqx,MissFunkyH,10,Mon Apr 21 21:06:18 2014 UTC,"I would either mix, or go for the lighter one and use bronzer for my forehead and sides of my face."
brownbeauty,23mdqx,lilylolalu,6,Mon Apr 21 22:58:45 2014 UTC,"In your shoes I would go for the C6 because, by the way you're describing it, it seems to be a closer match to your skin tone. However, I think /u/MissFunkyH has a really good point of blending foundations to get the perfect colour if you can afford it!"
brownbeauty,23mdqx,MissFunkyH,2,Mon Apr 21 21:09:06 2014 UTC,"Sorry if replying months later, but thanks for mentionning me, my comments usually disapear through the ''Internets'' ;)   Either blending both, or using the lighter shade where your skin is naturally highlighted, and the other for the contouring."
brownbeauty,23mdqx,hollyharlow,4,Wed Jul 23 18:34:39 2014 UTC,"My current foundation is too dark for me, so I mix it with a dab of moisturizer to lighten it up. Obviously this changes the coverage, but at least it matches my skin."
brownbeauty,23mdqx,Soan,2,Mon Apr 21 22:07:42 2014 UTC,"Mixing is the way to go. But personally, I just wouldn't buy it."
brownbeauty,23mdqx,Nikaa,2,Tue Apr 22 00:02:07 2014 UTC,"I'd get the lighter shade and use concealer for the darker areas [my eye area and mouth/chin/ladybeard area are noticeably darker], then blend and set the whole thing with a powder that works with your skin tone."
brownbeauty,23mdqx,krmtk,2,Tue Apr 22 09:17:28 2014 UTC,"Depends on how far away the matches are from my skin tone. If, like in your case, the lighter is only a little bit lighter and the dark is way darker, the lighter option is usually the better choice. I do own the MUFE flash palette though, and one of the fantastic uses I've found for the pigments is adding a little brown if a foundation is too light, white if it's too dark, and yellow if it's too pink. Also depends on the time of year/season, and if I know I'll get much darker because of sun exposure. Also, I find that different parts of my face are actually different colors, so the two foundation shade trick tends to work really well. It's also like a built in contouring step, so you don't have to worry about that part as much."
brownbeauty,23mdqx,zurinywele,1 point,Sun Apr 27 16:18:59 2014 UTC,I tried mixing two shades of the Cover Girl Tru foundation because none of the shades matched my skin tone individually. I thought I could mix the two shades I fell in between and did not work; the result was nowhere close. I personally wouldn't buy it because I would think how would it look in different lighting in comparison with the rest of my body.
brownbeauty,23mdqx,multirachael,1 point,Tue Apr 22 16:36:46 2014 UTC,"This is a bit late, but I always go lighter because I have oily skin, and the oil slightly darkens the pigment. So that if it looks a tiny bit pale at first, it will be about right in 30 min. :)"

The minecraft collection is absolutely superb, very bright vivid colors. The teal(""Steve"") I used for the mermaid look is from that collection as well as the dark smoky purple(""I'll hold that for you"").  I just bought the $1 samples and pressed them into pans. it's super cheap as well, so you can buy a ton of different colors!!  Only thing is if you are pressing them into pans be sure to add some binding agent to the alcohol as they are quite loose in consistency when they dry & will not stay pressed in the pan too long otherwise."

I have to stick with MUFE or even Clinique if i don't want to look strange or blend two shades (which is way too much work when you have to leave quickly)."
brownbeauty,235ws8,Cerikal,5,Wed Apr 16 13:11:16 2014 UTC,"I agree, both CC and Maybelline really need to get their shit together when it comes to darker tones. I really think CC is the bigger offender, though."

Dior Addict in 971 (Fourreau) -Perfect red.  NARS Matte in Valparaiso - Matte raspberry.  CK One Color in Liplock - Less purple than Smashbox. YSL Glossy Stain in 10 (Rouge Filtre) - Darker red. Lasts forever.  Sephora in N23 Dior LipGlow - MLBB and then some.    I also love the Bite line because most of their colors are SO highly pigmented.

brownbeauty,230jbj,lyly5545,3,Mon Apr 14 18:23:38 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I choose colors that I like. When I go shopping, I generally look for color first and then texture because finding that perfect color is super hard for me. There are definitely a few texture differences like the NARS and NARS Matte are completely different with one being super sheer and the other matte. The CK and Smashbox are similar in color but the CK is more matte while the Smashbox is more sheer.   I'm generally not so picky though when it comes to texture. As long as it looks good and my lips aren't super dry, I'm good!   Also, I love your username. Too good."

brownbeauty,22rksa,arielleassault,2,Fri Apr 11 09:09:15 2014 UTC,"I'm much darker than you and tried Dim Light for a couple of weeks. It didn't do much of anything and had a tendency to look ashy but you might have better results since you're tan-skinned...unless you have more of a warm/golden undertone.   I've also tried Radiant light and while it gives the skin a nice glow, it is quite glittery so might be better as a highlighter than an all over face powder. But these powders are really hit or miss so I strongly suggest swatching in store before you decide to buy.   I'm sorry if that wasn't much help! Have you searched for reviews on YouTube? There are a ton of reviews on there and I'm sure you can find some by people with a similar complexion."

I think its alright, good for the price though, I dont know any other drugstore nude liners  Nars larger than life in rue bonaparte. I think i'm going to return this because it's not any better than the rimmel (IMO) and also when i go to do my second eye it just wont go on sometimes (like the waterline is too wet even though it's not) and just gets weird. I don't think the price is worth it and i think i'm going to exchange to try the tarte again  jordana 24 hour lasting whatever in the nude color haha. I just tried this one day and it's decent. good for $4 and if i cant find my rimmel. but because it's big i can miss and get my lower lashes instead.  My method for applying is wiping off my waterline with a q tip then applying the pencil and then patting a powder foundation on top  my dream is a nude gel eyeliner haha"

My skin hasn't felt better (MAC products make me feel like I'm suffocating my face) and I use half the product it took for a good coverage on my face."

That being said, powder foundations aren't for everyone but we are coming out with a liquid formula toward the end of this month and beginning in May.  I definitely recommend going to a Bare minerals boutique to be color matched because 80% of my clients that come in are in the wrong shade matched at Sephora or Ulta.

Honestly, I haven't noticed any difference between the NARS primer and my UD primer potion. I kept reading about how great the NARS one is for oily lids, but they wore exactly the same. One day I wore NARS on one eye and UDPP on the other and by the end of the day there was no difference."

brownbeauty,221b8m,kitcat_kittycat,6,Thu Apr 3 00:48:15 2014 UTC,I'd love to see swatches on anyone who isn't extremely fair which is all I've seen so far.
brownbeauty,221b8m,TheYellowRose,4,Thu Apr 3 13:47:13 2014 UTC,"Yeah, as beautiful and lovely as the ladies are on /r/makeupaddiction, they're all super fair and there's very little swatching from brown ladies."
brownbeauty,21tq53,tofman,7,Mon Mar 31 13:17:50 2014 UTC,Your eyebrows are on point.  I don't think you posted your mascara. Looks like a brush through with a clean spoolie or metal comb would help
brownbeauty,21tq53,BunBunRN,2,Mon Mar 31 15:59:19 2014 UTC,"Oh thanks, I forgot, added it now! It was Maybelline's one by one volum' express.   And I find that brushing makes my lashes a bit grainy, but I usually use a plastic comb. Does a metal comb work better?"
brownbeauty,21tq53,jingabobo,3,Mon Mar 31 16:28:24 2014 UTC,"Oh yes I love my new metal lash comb, it gets rid of clumps and evens out the mascara."

brownbeauty,21tq53,ethiobirds,3,Tue Apr 1 01:37:26 2014 UTC,You look Gorgeous. I am a similar tone and sometimes its a pain to find a good foundation match let alone red lipstick. Thanks for the product list..I will look for those lip products now :)
brownbeauty,21sg8c,smoovgee,4,Mon Mar 31 00:54:31 2014 UTC,I use Trader Joes tea Tree Moisterizer during the day and Cerave PM Moisterizer at night. This has significantly cut down on the oil. Especially the tea tree moisterizer. My face use to be sooo oily. I'd wipe my face (T zones) every 30-60 minutes.

I've been using that for a month now, and the oil in my skin has subsided a little, even with a full face of makeup everyday. I also use the tea tree water as a toner at night, and use some Lancome creams I got in a freebie to help my skin while I sleep. I swear by Lush's products, the water spray is totally worth it!"

I was super disappointed with the Naked3 palette so this was a great buy for me. Like I know I will be using this every other day to wear to work.

brownbeauty,21h6n5,mycarebeardontcare,2,Thu Mar 27 12:12:18 2014 UTC,I usually don't use a new product right away but this palette just smelled so frickin delicious I haaaad to try it on at once.  I'd love to see your chocolate bar looks too!
brownbeauty,21h6n5,cocoaqueen,2,Thu Mar 27 23:35:07 2014 UTC,Your brows are AMAZING. I wish I could get mine to look that good. I'm definitely going to pick up this palette soon!
brownbeauty,21hdg7,zurinywele,1 point,Thu Mar 27 04:57:42 2014 UTC,Has it rolled under a bed or couch or something?
brownbeauty,21hdg7,teflonvixen,1 point,Thu Mar 27 15:22:02 2014 UTC,"I have checked both places as well as under the dresser, chairs, ironing board, linen closet, drawers and even in between my sheets. They are both long gone. It's baffling."

brownbeauty,21arhx,nattygene,6,Tue Mar 25 05:00:49 2014 UTC,You are not alone! I have the opposite problem - my face is darker than the rest of my body from the winter months (stupid scarves!) so I'm struggling to find a foundation/concealer light enough to match my neck but not end up looking like Casper on my face in normal lighting. AHH!
brownbeauty,21arhx,vixenpeon,2,Tue Mar 25 16:05:49 2014 UTC,"i'm so tempted to add the foundation to my neck and forget the consequences, but then i like my clothes make up free. it just feels so upsetting !!! >_< beauty shouldn't be so picky man"
brownbeauty,21arhx,SivajiTheBoss,3,Tue Mar 25 16:22:54 2014 UTC,"It may be that your actual tone range u should look for should be different like go cooler or neutral or warm (depending on which one that u used currently). Also for ladies of brown tones, they just don't give us as many in-between shades or shade options in general so we just have to ""tough it out"".   Have you tried mixing any as well? Or use the light tones as a highlight and the darker tones in the contoured areas, that can help you look more natural. :)"
brownbeauty,21arhx,SivajiTheBoss,3,Sun Mar 30 17:19:02 2014 UTC,that is a good idea. mixing the two. the ones i bought would need to be mixed real well to get that white undertone out thats for sure. but im still on the hunt for one that works. have you ever heard of black opal cosmetics? they seem to have stuff that works

brownbeauty,215ko2,creamcup,1 point,Mon Mar 24 14:54:01 2014 UTC,"I've never used a NARS blush! But I also have Red Vino. It's a pretty wine colored shade. I like it as well but because it's a deeper color it doesn't get used as much. Usually when I'm going out at night or something, just because it's more dramatic I guess."
brownbeauty,215ko2,creamcup,1 point,Mon Mar 24 15:31:19 2014 UTC,Ooo I wanna check that out it sounds pretty! The NARS blush I have is Luster maybe its not dark enough or something. Luminoso is wayyy better.

brownbeauty,20rd06,vixenpeon,3,Wed Mar 19 02:04:26 2014 UTC,Thank you! I thought about getting shameless at first too but since it's $9 here I just spent the extra $6 (at the time it was $15) for Heroine. It's a very lovely shade though and I think shameless would look just as good! I just wanted more MAC Mattes since I love the formula.

brownbeauty,20hvld,cron_nin,5,Sat Mar 15 18:38:38 2014 UTC,"I‚Äôm new at this too so take what I say with a grain of salt.  Eyebrows. There is some shape there and you picked out a really good color too! But the shape can be better. Here‚Äôs some tutorials to get them in check. (I‚Äôm just partial to really good eyebrows).  http://i.imgur.com/SLFreeL.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/ySAt64Z.jpg  http://imgur.com/a/SgibW  Are you using a base shadow? Get an eyeshadow that matches the color of your skin (or as close as possible) and put it from base of your eyebrow to the eyelid. The whole thing. It helps make the color blend together/ make the blending process easier.  What sort of eyeshadow brushes are you using? When you have the right tools, your eyeshadow game goes up. Use a stiffer, flat brush to pat it on your eyelid, going up to your crease. And use a crease brush to get the darker shade up in there. I only cover the outer half of the crease. I feel it makes my eyes smaller. Blending doing tiny circles or windshield wiper motion.  Here‚Äôs what helped me figure out some eyeshadow shapes.  http://www.makeupgeek.com/makeup-basics/makeup-101-how-to-apply-eye-makeup/  http://www.makeupgeek.com/makeup-basics/10-shapes-for-your-eyeshadow/  This is my opinion, but the darker shade you have, you pulled the color out too far.   And I appreciated your lipstick swatch post! Good luck!"
brownbeauty,20hvld,cron_nin,1 point,Sat Mar 15 19:36:23 2014 UTC,OMG! Thank you for such a detailed crit.  I am not very good at telling the shapes of things. Can you tell what kind of face shape I have?  I did use a base. As far as brushes I have the eco tools eye set.  I will definitely give these tutorials a look over and try to improve.  It looks like I will do another lipstick swatch post sometime soon because I have acquired a few more and it seems like a lot of people really liked it. I am glad you were one of those.

I use it to blend.  http://www.makeupalley.com/product/showreview.asp/ItemId=142590/Domed-Shadow-Brush/Real-Techniques-by-Samantha-Chapman/Makeup-Brushes  As for face shape... I don't feel super comfortable telling you that, I don't want to tell you the wrong thing or something you don't agree with. Eyebrows can help if you feel insecure about your face shape. By process of elimination, I say oval. Your face isn't short like mine, but it's not really long. You have a decent jawline, but it's not super prominent.   If anyone else has an opinion..."

brownbeauty,1zu7be,secretcarnivalworker,5,Fri Mar 7 20:58:39 2014 UTC,"I got these NYX loose pearl eyeshadows back in January, and although I love them, I find loose shadows to be a bit cumbersome. I've been storing mine in little 5g sifter jars, which held about 1/2 the product in each container, but it was still messy. I wanted to create a more solid and easier to use product, something like the L'Oreal Infallible eyeshadow pots. Here's what I did:   Each container has 5ml of product. I emptied everything into a separate container, used a glass medicine dropper and added 91% rubbing alcohol. I can't really say exactly how much alcohol I used for each container, because some colors needed more than others. I added enough to achieve a paste-like or wet sand consistency. It should be wet, but not too runny. You can also use 70% alcohol for this, but in my experience, it takes longer to dry. For binding, I added two drops of vegetable glycerin per 5ml container. You absolutely need a binder, because unlike the MAC loose pigments, these NYX loose eyeshadows don't contain any binding ingredients in the formula, and would crumble if pressed with alcohol alone. I also recommend using no more than 2 drops of glycerin per 5ml container, because using more would result in a rubbery product that won't stick to your brush.  I transferred the wet product to each 5g jar and lightly tapped the jar to release air bubbles. I let this sit for a few hours until completely dry.   I'm quite pleased with the end result, and there was no change in the quality or pigmentation. Some additional notes for anyone wanting to try this:   Work in an environment that's easy to clean because this can and will be messy. Sanitize all tools with alcohol before starting. I recommend wearing gloves because some shades can stain. I also recommend wearing a nose/face mask, because you don't want to be breathing in the pigments.

brownbeauty,1zkpi1,fatpinkchicken,4,Wed Mar 5 04:40:55 2014 UTC,Concealing in general would be super amazing

Like, for example    I plan on having models ranging from NC35-NC50 in these videos, which I may sort based on skin type.    I'm inferring that means something about skin type, but I don't know what it actually means. So some basic introduction (with visuals, if possible) about the terminology you see in blogs, on this subreddit, etc. would be REALLY helpful for those of us who are still intimidated by the foreign language that is makeup."
brownbeauty,1zkpi1,zurinywele,4,Wed Mar 5 18:02:29 2014 UTC,"This is an incredibly helpful suggestion, thank you. That may be my first video, actually!  Also NC35-NC50 is just a range for foundation colors using mac's standard foundation range. I'm NC42 in Mac Studio Fix foundation!"

I do think that a lot of what she said about colorism (and how it relates to men) is wrong and very one-sided and accusatory.  It's almost sad that Lupita's win, as a pretty and talented actress, is such a big deal to people in this day and age."
brownbeauty,1zdtah,hotbeverage,9,Sun Mar 2 23:04:02 2014 UTC,"Her hair looks great! As more general feedback, I found the video to be pretty dark. For hair it was okay, but if she's looking to do more makeup tutorials, I would say to look into better lighting. There are lots of tutorials on the best way to set up, or even sitting by a window for natural lighting would make a big difference. :)"
brownbeauty,1zdtah,baloothenewf,2,Mon Mar 3 14:56:17 2014 UTC,Got it! Better lighting. Thanks!! :)
brownbeauty,1zdtah,Sup_Nigga,16,Mon Mar 3 16:26:50 2014 UTC,"Being 100% honest here, although it seems from your comments that she's trying to help, in the video it comes off as her being far too INTO herself. She pouts far too much, like almost the entire video, it is extremely off-putting, maybe be a little bit more relatable? She's a beautiful girl, I love her makeup skills & crazy hairstyling skills, but when I subscribe to someone, it's because I see a friend giving me advice. If she just smiled her natural smile the whole way through, that'd be 150% better :)   Also, when someone's just starting out and putting ads on their videos already, it just says ""I'm only here for the $$, not to help people."""

brownbeauty,1zdtah,leblady,1 point,Mon Mar 3 16:24:28 2014 UTC,I agree with the pouting bit. Michelle Phan does that & along with her  incessant winking it irritates me SO much. I dunno maybe tweens like that kind of stuff. I think I may be too old to appreciate these type of gestures lol.

brownbeauty,1zdtah,vanessajellouli,4,Sun Mar 9 00:59:58 2014 UTC,You should tell your GF to consider doing a tutorial on her makeup in this video. I bet a lot of ladies would be interested in that as well!

brownbeauty,1z47lp,supcaci,2,Thu Feb 27 23:33:23 2014 UTC,Which oil do you use? I've heard of oil cleansing but hadn't considered it until now.

(I'd link directly but I'm on my phone, sorry!) I personally am using 100% jojoba oil right now; I get it from Trader Joes. Been doing it for about a month and I love it. I'm also clearing some acne and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation right now so I do other stuff in addition, but there are folks (like Lupita Nyong'o, apparently?) who just do oil cleansing and swear by it."
brownbeauty,1z47lp,supcaci,1 point,Fri Feb 28 04:50:56 2014 UTC,Ok! Thank you! I have some almond oil so I'll see what it says about using that. What are you doing to clear up your hyperpigmentation? I need that because I have some on my face too!
brownbeauty,1z47lp,supcaci,2,Fri Feb 28 08:13:40 2014 UTC,"Haha, my skincare routine is pretty elaborate and definitely not all-natural at this point :) (Keep in mind, though, that ""natural"" does not automatically mean something is safe or good for you!) Since you asked, this is what I'm doing:  In the morning I just rinse with lukewarm water and put on sunscreen (EltaMD Clear, has niacinamide and vitamin C and stuff) that helps to clear acne and PIH and prevent re-darkening spots. At night I oil cleanse with the jojoba, wipe off excess oil, cleanse again with Desert Essence tea tree oil cleanser to get off any used oil I might have missed (I double cleanse at this point because I'm still clearing acne and can't afford any extra germs!), then tone with a mandelic acid toner to bring down the pH of my face for exfoliation. For exfo, I alternate every other night between a salicylic acid serum (Yes To Tomatoes acne repair lotion) for acne clearing and mandelic acid (right now I'm using Makeup Artist's Choice 10% mandelic acid serum, will probably switch to Garden of Wisdom's alcohol-free one when this one runs out) for clearing PIH. I wait and let whatever exfoliant I'm using that night do its work for ~20 minutes, then moisturize with more jojoba oil and an occlusive layer of Aquaphor to keep in moisture and help keep out germs.   I've been doing this for a few weeks and my skin has made A LOT of progress already. It's smoother than it's been since middle school and my spots are fading without using anything dangerous like hydroquinone. I highly recommend checking out /r/skincareaddiction, they take a research-based approach to skincare. Their sidebar is chock full of good info and they have a great calendar of helpful daily and weekly threads. Good luck!"

Liners do help sometimes. I also use foundation on my lips occasionally so I can have a lighter base.   I know MAC makes a product called Lip Erase but I haven't tried it out. Its seriously frustrating to have SO many colors that I can't wear."
brownbeauty,1z26c0,theheebiejeebies,3,Thu Feb 27 06:07:13 2014 UTC,"My lips are slightly discolored. I don't (can't) use tinted lip balm, unless it is very pigmented.

I do find it helpful to use my Mary Kay Satin Lips on a regular basis and I always use a lip primer before I put on any lipsticks...that includes my nude shades as well."
brownbeauty,1z26c0,zurinywele,1 point,Thu Feb 27 07:45:58 2014 UTC,"I either go for darker colours when it comes to tinted lip balms and the Revlon Balm Stains are amazing as well.  If that doesn't work out, you could also use a little foundations or concealer to cancel out your lips as well."
brownbeauty,1z26c0,youtittle,1 point,Sun Mar 2 21:59:51 2014 UTC,My lips are naturally reddish purple so I deal with it by just utilizing the natural pigmentation. I find semi-sheer but build-able lipsticks to be the most flattering because the pigment of the lipstick works with my natural shade to produce a usually flattering color. Salma Hayek's Nuance line I think is perfect for pigmented lips because her lipsticks and Milanis are the only ones that flatter me at the drugstore!
brownbeauty,1z26c0,Chewy2000,1 point,Mon Mar 3 02:51:38 2014 UTC,I bring some foundation over my lips when I'm applying it to my face! It dulls out some of their natural color so the lip product can really be true to the tube.
brownbeauty,1z26c0,talizorahNR,1 point,Fri Mar 7 17:43:44 2014 UTC,"I use a concealer that matches my skin tone over my lips, use a brown liner pencil and blend into the lip color with a lip brush. This method had vastly improved the range of colors I can use."

brownbeauty,1yrj5m,lunaicognita,3,Mon Feb 24 10:34:10 2014 UTC,"I am a giant Foundation Hooor.  I've only been back into makeup for about 10 months, and these are what I've run through.  All of these I test over primer because my skin is ridiculously oily.     CoverGirl Queen 3 in 1 is my HG.  It held up to the heat and humidity of a DC summer while matching my skin perfectly.  I love that 8 hours in it looks like I just put it on. CG TruBlend is my current go to foundation.  I can already tell that it won't stand up to Summer wear, but it's great coverage and a good match. Revlon ColorStay Combo/Oily would be my HG if they had a better shade range.  The undertones lean too pink in the shades that matched me.  At least the shade range is good, which is more than I can say for their Nearly Naked and CS Whipped.  They ran up to about NC 50-55 in MAC, but it seems like either they discontinued the darker end of the shade range or they aren't offering it in store anymore.   Black Radiance's BB Cream is outstanding.  That is all. Garnier's BB Cream in Deep is a decent match for me and it wears pretty well.  I don't care what the package says, I still need a primer with it because I am THAT oily.   Maybelline's BB Cream in Deep was a good match but it gave me a zit the size of Jupiter.  Not cool. Maybelline's Fit Me Liquid.  Decent shade range, but wears like crap imo.  It leaves a dewey finish, which just makes me feel like I need to blot.  And then 2 hours in I realize that no, I really am having oil break through and do need to blot.  4 hours later, and it had pretty much faded off my face. Bare Minerals Original.  Before I gave up on makeup years ago, this was my go to foundation.  I wore and loved it for years.  It does amazingly in the summer heat and humidity, it matches me perfectly, but after getting my skin care routine down, I realized it was breaking me out.  I found out this is a common problem because of the bismuth and that their other foundations don't have it."
brownbeauty,1yrj5m,frumperbell,2,Tue Feb 25 16:50:10 2014 UTC,'Size of Jupiter'   I had to laugh. I too get oily a lot ESPECIALLY on my forehead. Picture your favorite actress agreeing to take a picture with you one night at an event.  When you finally look at the picture you can't show it to anybody because your forehead was so shiny it caught the flash of the camera.   Now I'm trying milk of magnesium as a primer. Day 3 and it seems to be doing ok. I think I'm about a NC45.

That is exactly why I stopped wearing makeup for so long.  It got to a point in the summer where my forehead and ching would get so oily by noon that everything just melted off.  I've had a lot of luck with silicone based primers: ELF Mineral Infused Face Primer and Monistat's Chafing Gel are pretty similar and they feel so nice going on.  Black Radiance's primer is nice too, but I only started using it in December.  I guess I'll see if it's really great when gets hot out."

brownbeauty,1yrj5m,stefwitaf,1 point,Mon Feb 24 12:45:59 2014 UTC,I've had success with Bobbi Brown. I feel Mac is so heavy whereas Bobbi is light and matches my skin

I use Earth 4 and it goes up to Earth 6, I believe.  The only problem I have with it, is that it rubs off a lot."

brownbeauty,1yrj5m,trustmeimawriter,1 point,Tue Feb 25 10:21:44 2014 UTC,"I loveeeee MUFE's HD foundation. I'm at the very end of my first bottle but I swear by it. One thing I really like about this foundation line is that I don't have to automatically default to the darkest shade that the line offers. It isn't full coverage but I'm a person with a LOT of PIH and I feel perfectly comfortable going out with just that on :)  (For reference, I'm #178 in that foundation)  Edit: As a sidenote, I also find that this is a lot more natural looking than a lot of other foundations. I tried Kat Von D's foundation in an equivalent shade and it was also very nice but broke me out)"

brownbeauty,1y9i97,organophobic,1 point,Tue Feb 18 23:58:13 2014 UTC,No problem. I would say the most peachy one was NYX
brownbeauty,1y9i97,organophobic,2,Wed Feb 19 00:23:01 2014 UTC,So. I'm a total noob and I came here to say I ADORE how Stila Stay All Day Liquid Lipstick looks. Is there a cheaper lip....thing that would be somewhat similar. It's like a lip stain right? Where would I even start looking for things similar to it? Sorry for the noobish-ness. :)
brownbeauty,1y9i97,Moushu,3,Wed Feb 19 02:03:44 2014 UTC,"Is ok. We all gotta start somewhere and truthfully, I'm still a noob myself. You should see mah blending skills, like a t-rex in a tornado.  Any who, I'm not sure as far as staying power but honestly I think NYX has a similar color in one of their lip lines.  Edit: NYX is at Ulta, Target and CVS. My best advice would be to go to Ulta and tell the SA that you are looking for something similar to what Stila has cuz Ulta has high end and drug store stuffs."

I have had great luck with both Stila and Urban Decay. I have the Naked Basics palette because I don't like shimmery stuff, and it shows up great. The Stila pigments are very intense. I've also had pretty good luck with some Avon palettes, but I'm not a huge fan of the quality as compared to the Stila and UD."

brownbeauty,1xuhlh,oldhaunts_,2,Mon Feb 24 04:35:45 2014 UTC,"Either the kit, which comes with a translucent setting powder or you can just buy the individual concealer. I go from NC43- NC45 depending on the season and I use the Golden coloured concealer which matches me really well."
brownbeauty,1xuhlh,jingabobo,2,Thu Feb 27 11:19:23 2014 UTC,It is not dark at all! You have to use it very sparingly as it does have a brightening effect and can end up looking white on you. I like to mix it with a more orange concealer (like Nyx orange concealer or Bobbi Brown in deep Peach) to get the perfect color.
brownbeauty,1xqlfv,stefwitaf,6,Wed Feb 12 20:40:40 2014 UTC,"NYX has some great matte reds, and I usually find them for about 5-6 bucks."

And if the photograph at the bottom is the writer, she is gorgeous. To me though, it came off a little ""special snowflake""-y, as if all of us Indian girls act the same and try to look white.

Meh. We are way past that level these days thanks to YouTube and awesome forums like these.  The One point I consider most useful to desi women including myself is the not trying to lighten our face by using mismatched lighter foundation.  I am guilty of doing this in my youth because it's what I had always seen done back in India. It was the main reason I never wore foundation much, cos i looked like a damn flour faced fool that had photoshopped a lighter head onto my tan body.lol. I now wear matching or even darker foundation, sometimes barely escaping the Oompa Loompa look but it's better than flour face any day!! :)"

brownbeauty,1wtizz,pandapolarbear,1 point,Wed Feb 5 05:24:12 2014 UTC,Oh yeah! Cheek waxing (and sideburn waxing) are totally helpful. I rarely wax them (maybe 3-4 times a year max) but the results last for at least 2 months each time! :)

brownbeauty,1wpi1x,randomOP,1 point,Sat Feb 1 05:21:10 2014 UTC,Lovely! Can I just say your lipsticks are quite fabulous? Train Bleu looked great on you.   I have oily lids and even UDPP/TF Shadow Insurance don't stay on me too well. I've been considering trying the Mac paint pots - thoughts?
brownbeauty,1wpi1x,randomOP,2,Sat Feb 1 07:48:33 2014 UTC,"aha I have them oily lids as well but in winter its a little more manageable, it all stays frozen in place I guess lol.  Personally my favorite base is Laura Mercier's Base in Wheat. its a little expensive but will last forever cos it's super pigmented and stay matte for a good 8 hours. Also the color makes for a great base, it does not look ashy. Try out a sample in a color complimenting your skin tone, from Sephora.  Mac Soft Ochre is also a good base but looks a bit ashy on me, it does a good job of keeping the lid matte for 8 ish hours. I would use this more for darker shadows & shimmer ones to conceal the ashiness.  NYX Eye Base in 03 is also a short wear alternative for 2-3 hours but creases after that. Probably needs a good primer underneath it. theBalm's Put a lid on it is a great primer but it does not have any color coverage, it is sheer.  I used to like UDPP but it creased a bit on hot summer days. Same with TooFaced, it changed consistency in a couple months, an oily residue would come out of the tube and after that it's coverage got patchy eh no thanks.  Hmm Now I'm thinking I should do an eyeshdow base swatch post.  :)"

I only found this palette at a JC Penny Sephora of all places, for reference I live in NY and couldn't find it in the places I expected to.   So I swatched and was very disappointed. I'm still new to makeup but I want a versatile palette, not one where I spend a ton of money and can only use 5 to 7 shades out of 12. A few days after this Sephora find, I went to Ulta to make a return and bought the Anastasia CatWalk palette as an impulse buy. I'm a bit iffy on it but the shades are lovely, and I'm okay with having spent $29 and there being only 1 shade that I know to be unwearable.   One last note about the CatWalk palette, like Chocolate Bar, the names aren't printed so I either have to keep the box or sharpie the names on. Ugh. :/"

brownbeauty,1vkzhb,trefoils,3,Sun Jan 19 08:01:54 2014 UTC,"I know this isn't quite the answer to your question, but I have a few alternatives!   If you have time to, go over your liquid liner with a matte black eyeshadow. This helps the black both look deeper and last longer. It also matte-ifys the liquid liner.  Gel liners tend to dry matte-er than liquid liners, so you might try one of those. It's a good way to practice your brush skills. Also, I believe gel liner is a bit more forgiving than liquid, so if you mess up, well, no problem!  I've had luck with Jordana liquid liner, but it still has a very slight semi-gloss finish."
brownbeauty,1vkzhb,Geekyisland,1 point,Sun Jan 19 14:56:23 2014 UTC,"That gel eyeliner is amazing. It doesn't budge.   I also agree with the earlier comment about setting the glossy liner with a tiny but of shadow. I put some on a small angled brush and slowly ""stamp"" on the eyeliner. It can also be used to soften the edges."

brownbeauty,1v6b66,lymsia,3,Tue Jan 14 07:35:53 2014 UTC,I do not own (at least never buying full price! :] ) any of the naked palettes basically because I figured it is just going to be a shimmery mess. The subtle differences in shades are lost on my NC44 skintone. Personally I like the NYX eyeshadow Base in 03 and the Laura Mercier Base in Wheat.
brownbeauty,1v6b66,jingabobo,3,Wed Jan 15 00:01:19 2014 UTC,"I had the same issue with the Naked 2 palette, and ended up getting rid of it because it was far too cool-leaning for me.  Like some of the others suggested, try layering it with a brown-ish base (Maybelline Bad to the Bronze might be good for this!).  If worst comes to worst, you could just exchange it for the warmer Naked 1."
brownbeauty,1v6b66,strawberriilove,3,Thu Jan 16 11:40:39 2014 UTC,"I would like to thank all you lovely ladies for your input,  you gals really helped!   I bought ELF's primer in sheer and it definitely helped!!!!!"
brownbeauty,1v6b66,ethiobirds,2,Fri Jan 17 00:17:21 2014 UTC,Same exact thing happens for me whether it's Naked1 or 2. I'm an absolute idiot when it comes to eyeshadow so I'll be looking out for tips :/
brownbeauty,1ut9mb,crunkchip,7,Thu Jan 9 18:15:02 2014 UTC,"Try something with an orange base! For some people (not me, personally) the $3 NYX orange concealer works wonders. You could try that first if you can find it, since it's a super cheap option!  As for me, the MAC studio finish concealer works great. The darker NW shades come with an orange base, without being straight up orange, and can be matched to your skin tone.  Now since these concealers aren't meant for the under-eye area, they can crease. I don't find this to be a problem for everyday wear, but if I have extra time or am doing a night-time look, I pair it with MAC prolongwear concealer on top, in a few shades lighter. That seriously works wonders for me. Here's an old B&A of mine that shows the difference even when I have really dark circles from sleep deprivation.   I hope that helped! Let me know if you have other questions!"
brownbeauty,1ut9mb,ethiobirds,3,Thu Jan 9 19:17:31 2014 UTC,"An ORANGE base, I don't think I've seen that before, but then again I am a total makeup n00b.  I will take a look. Thank you so much!"
brownbeauty,1ut9mb,ethiobirds,4,Thu Jan 9 20:50:23 2014 UTC,"No problem! A lot of us Indian girls have blue/black undertones to our dark circles and orange is the best way to brighten that up, just as yellow works for our fairer sisters!"
brownbeauty,1ut9mb,Jnnlopez,3,Thu Jan 9 23:10:34 2014 UTC,"I'm always on the quest for the perfect concealer! I have genetic dark circles, I've grown accustomed to them and realize they will never fully be covered and I can only make them look better. I'm an NC42 and here are the products I use most often:  Eve Pearl Salmon concealer. I love this concealer! Peachy/orange tint. Not a super thick formula but provides great coverage. I use the safe Tan. Probably my favorite concealer! Eve Pearl doesn't get enough love.  Nars creamy concealer in Caramel good coverage for under eyes as well as my face. Not super heavy coverage.  The Balm Time Balm in mid-medium and medium dark. I use the mid medium for highlighting since it's a bit too light for under my eyes. The medium dark under my eyes and it has good coverage, doesn't crease.  MAC Prolongwear in Nc42 this is super full coverage and tends to be placed from my eyelids, dark circles to my mid cheek for that ultra highlighted look.  I use plenty more but these are my faves. Hope this helps a little. Good luck on your quest!"
brownbeauty,1ut9mb,definitelynotsatan,3,Sun Jan 12 00:19:06 2014 UTC,"I'm about a NC 37-42 (I don't use Mac but those are my matches); my favorite concealers are from benefit. Fake up is my everyday go to, and erase paste is for days when I'm wearing a full face. Both look like really intimidating shades of salmon in the container but apply beautifully."
brownbeauty,1ut9mb,ethiobirds,3,Thu Jan 9 21:19:16 2014 UTC,So I'm NC 42-43 but have never tried Benefit; what shades of fake up and erase paste do you use?
brownbeauty,1ut9mb,definitelynotsatan,4,Thu Jan 9 23:09:35 2014 UTC,"I'm currently medium in both, but when I'm tan (closer to nc 42) in the summer the fake up is too light. For the erase paste, I used to use dark because its much thicker and the color is closer to orange than pink, but since my dark circles aren't so bad anymore, I've switched to medium. The products are both pretty great but the color range sucks. :("
brownbeauty,1ut9mb,22catch,3,Thu Jan 9 23:36:45 2014 UTC,This is exactly what I want to know! Thanks OP :)
brownbeauty,1ut9mb,jingabobo,3,Fri Jan 10 05:08:26 2014 UTC,"ORANGE is your friend girlfriend! Check my earlier post for hyperpigmentation, same products work for under eye.  I bought em all and am in process of figuring out what works best. So far Bobbi Brown concealer in Deep Peach is winning. Erase Paste in deep in good but its more pale. MUFE Camoflouge palette is also good.  Bad news is that ALL of these products are hella expensive. I could not find the NYX orange concealer but that's a great place to start at $4."
brownbeauty,1ut9mb,frumperbell,2,Fri Jan 10 05:38:46 2014 UTC,"You have to order it from NYX's website, since Ulta carries every shade but orange."
brownbeauty,1ut9mb,Tanjinuts,3,Fri Jan 10 12:36:27 2014 UTC,Hi! I'm Bengali so I know your pain lol. I started using the loreal true match concealer stick. It has a real nice yellow undertone that looks really good on my dark skin.
brownbeauty,1ut9mb,eagleonajourney,1 point,Fri Jan 10 08:19:00 2014 UTC,which shade do you use?
brownbeauty,1ut9mb,Tanjinuts,1 point,Tue Jan 14 15:44:22 2014 UTC,I use medium/deep n6-7-8. It's a couple shades lighter than my under eye bags but it matches once I put powder under it.
brownbeauty,1ut9mb,frumperbell,2,Tue Jan 14 20:33:32 2014 UTC,"Yes, you need orange concealer.  Put the orange down under your foundation, and then regular concealer over top if you still need a bit more coverage.    I was using and loving NYX in a Jar until I dropped it in the toilet like a doof.  Since then, after asking for recs over on /r/MakeupAddicts, I've been using Maybelline's Color Tatttoo in Fierce & Tangy since I already had it.  It works really well and doesn't crease.  If you want to see the rest of their suggestions, here's my thread.  HTH!"
brownbeauty,1ut9mb,Eklove5,2,Fri Jan 10 03:40:11 2014 UTC,I use Dior foundation and it's beautiful!
brownbeauty,1uqhfz,applesandcherry,5,Wed Jan 8 20:10:55 2014 UTC,Wet n Wild  Some Elf - usually a hit or miss  L'Oreal Infalliable  Maybelline eyeshadows in general are usually pretty good  Revlon colorstay eyeshadow quads  The Revlin eyeshadow that is just one rectangle with 5 shades - it has a braided texture over it but it's pretty pigmented
brownbeauty,1uqhfz,Daneelbel_Lee,3,Wed Jan 8 22:03:42 2014 UTC,I second all of this.
brownbeauty,1uqhfz,recycledpaper,3,Wed Jan 8 22:21:08 2014 UTC,"If you're doing ELF stick to the studio line ($3). I find the basic $1 line is worthless. I have the neutral palette (which was like $5) and I love it. It isn't as good as say, Urban Decay, but it is such a bargain for the price. Use some good brushes and primer and you're good to go.   Also the cream eyeshadow in ""dawn"" is nearly an exact match for the benefit ""watts up"" highlighter."
brownbeauty,1uqhfz,whythehecknot,3,Wed Jan 8 23:02:24 2014 UTC,L'Oreal Infallibles are fantastic.
brownbeauty,1uqhfz,lyly5545,5,Wed Jan 8 21:14:41 2014 UTC,I've heard the maybelline color tattoo eyeshadows are good
brownbeauty,1uqhfz,avocadomuffin,1 point,Wed Jan 8 21:08:15 2014 UTC,"I can confirm this. I've tried the bronze and copper and they're quite pigmented, even without a primer."
brownbeauty,1uqhfz,frumperbell,1 point,Thu Jan 9 17:06:30 2014 UTC,"Pomegranate Punk is awesome too, and Tough as Taupe makes a great base/primer substitute."
brownbeauty,1uqhfz,Ruks,2,Fri Jan 10 03:44:57 2014 UTC,"I find Bourjois is one of the better drugstore brands for eyeshadows. I'm a little biased though as I love their light shimmery shades for everyday. Just remember not to use the little applicator that comes with them and use proper brushes! Sleek is pretty good, too."
brownbeauty,1uqhfz,deliriousmintii,1 point,Wed Jan 8 20:55:27 2014 UTC,I'm going to make the assumption your from the UK?  I love Sleek cosmetics but they don't sell them in the US (I haven't seen Bourjois either).  I made a international Sleek blush order a few weeks ago but it's not something I can do very often :/
brownbeauty,1uqhfz,fatpinkchicken,2,Wed Jan 8 21:00:51 2014 UTC,"L'oreal has some great eyeshadows. I also recommend that you try maybe using the NYX large white pencil under the eyeshadow to make the colors more vibrant.   Here's a youtube video of a black lady using it. You can skip ahead to the 4:00 mark to see her using NYX on one side, and eyeshadow alone on the other side. It makes the colors really stand out. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAvVS5R0L6E  You can get these online or at Ulta. Sometimes Ulta has great deals with NYX where you buy 2 and get 1 free. I recommend these pencils!"
brownbeauty,1uqhfz,iamjob,2,Wed Jan 8 22:13:07 2014 UTC,"Wet N Wild makes a great eyeshadow primer in the Ferge line and has some fantastic shadows. I use them all the time and they work on me, and I'm pretty dark."
brownbeauty,1uqhfz,cron_nin,2,Thu Jan 9 00:45:02 2014 UTC,"Rimmel's not all that bad, but be careful. I agree with other posters about Wet N' Wild. It's really surprising how pigmented their shadows are-- especially the Color Icon range!"
brownbeauty,1uqhfz,classycrempie,1 point,Thu Jan 9 03:17:47 2014 UTC,The physicians formula eye shadow palettes are pretty good too if you use a primer and dampen the eyeshadow slightly.
brownbeauty,1uqhfz,Prinsessa,1 point,Thu Jan 9 02:37:40 2014 UTC,"When using drugstore stuff, I always use a primer underneath, like UD or Lorac. I heard from makeupaddiction that you can use NYX milk jumbo pencil (drugstore brand) to bring our a better color in your less pigmented brands."
brownbeauty,1uqhfz,fantastic_lee,1 point,Thu Jan 9 03:01:55 2014 UTC,Don't forget to use a primer on your eyelids! I use Urban Decay Primer Potion and every color shows up no matter what brand or pigmentation. I've found that it makes any eye shadow show up- even ones that normally fade away in to my skin.

brownbeauty,1uqhfz,slendermansdaughter,1 point,Thu Jan 9 08:58:23 2014 UTC,"l'oreal has wonderful eye-shadows that are pigmented and soft and is actually the same company as urban decay.  physician's formula's warm nude shadow palette is very pigmented but also quite shimmery   ELF 32 shadow palette's dark matte shades are amazingly pigmented and last for ages, and in my experience much more so than higher end brands. that being said they feel a bit dry and scratchy when applying."

brownbeauty,1ueclu,wordflapdragon,6,Sat Jan 4 20:41:12 2014 UTC,"YES THANK YOU. I've been trying to perfect this cut crease for-freaking-ever.   It's honestly, just learning not to blend errything. I'm such a hardcore blender (VITAMIX ANYONE?! hoho)  that I would just muddy up my line when I first started.   For this eye, I took a blend of a dark brown (LORAC espresso) and a dark navy blue color to sketch out a line. I'd take the remainder of what was on my brush and drag the top of the line upward. I'd add more color as needed-- both to the line and to the shadow on top. I blended it out with a peach colored shadow close to my skin tone, and repeated the process. It took... well, let's just say I left the house 30 minutes later than I anticipated. :3  I've discovered that it's just practice, honestly. Like, I definitely couldn't get this to be so nice 6 months ago."
brownbeauty,1ucexp,makeupnoob1,5,Fri Jan 3 22:20:12 2014 UTC,"If you're going for a no makeup makeup look, this looks great.

For liquid I use Guerlain.  It's on the pricier side but the coverage and color matching is great, you don't need a lot when you put it on, and it glides like butter when it's on my face.  You can try the Parure de Lumiere in #23 - Dore Natural for a soft, dewy finish OR Tenue de Perfection in #04 - Beige Moyen for a finish that's more matte with higher coverage, more similar in consistency with KVD.   For powder foundation, I use Dolce & Gabbana which sounds expensive, but is actually cheaper per ounce than Laura Mercier (my old brand).  I use #150 in Almond for that."

brownbeauty,1u9cib,seirianstar,2,Fri Jan 3 01:29:17 2014 UTC,"I love your piercings and glasses! We are a similar skin tone, except in some lighting I look yellow(I have no idea why I look beige sometimes and yellow other times) and I have yet to find a foundation or concealer that match. I've been trying to get serious about makeup for about a year.   Everyone's skin reacts to products differently, so some foundations and/or concealers can clog your pores, cause break outs or redness. If you have sensitive skin, try to go as natural as you can with anything that goes on your face. Sometimes this can be more expensive up front but over time, you'll pay far less than you would be if you had to pay for medicines/cures/what have you for rashes, bumps, etc. I think mineral makeup would be the way to go if you'd like to go with a less harsh option.   There are mineral/natural/vegan makeup companies on Etsy. I have purchased from some of them and they are lovely as far as customer service goes. I haven't tried foundation from any of them. I'm going to talk to them soon about it though.   Remember to always, always, always take makeup off before bed. You can wash it off in the shower(I love that brand of body washes) or use an oil(olive, coconut, grapeseed, jojoba) on a cotton ball/cotton pad to take it off. The oils cost about $7 last forever and ever.  This is a great shampoo brand to use. It's hydrating but doesn't leave my hair oily. I recommend it alllll the time and so far, everyone that I've recommended it to has loved it. I don't use the conditioners because I use coconut oil to condition my hair overnight a few times a week.  There are some great tutorials here. I have yet to find one there for a hair style that I can follow/understand but there are pleeenty of great ones for makeup/nails in there. I really like this one for winged eyeliner. If you end up wanting to go what I consider ""really fancy"" and contour your face, this tutorial seems like it would be great for that! This page has lots of good information for a beginner. Lastly here are some eyeshadow ideas for when you can't think of anything.   I hope that helps!"

brownbeauty,1u6etm,chiffonandheels,2,Thu Jan 2 07:18:37 2014 UTC,"Ooh, green is really only for redness, so avoid using green on your hyperpigmented areas!   I had a huge post on this a few months back-- I think I recommended NYX's concealer in a jar in orange as well as the l'oreal color correcting primer in orange. You'd want to mix the NYX concealer with some of your normal concealer and try layering it on to your desired coverage. Use a light hand, otherwise you'll end up looking orange!  :) Hope this helps."

brownbeauty,1tv5ik,business_time_,4,Sat Dec 28 14:34:02 2013 UTC,"Do you want to hear the story of how I got this palette?? Gather round children..this is one long a**ed story.  So couple weeks ago I saw a bunch of YouTube videos & blogs raving about this holiday palette and more than anything I was craving the Tarte blushes, at $25 each these are some pretty expensive blushes!  I waaaanted it no neeeeded it so bad! Plus I had the 20% off coupon to use so this was going to be a fantastic deal.  I ran to Ulta in the 2nd week of Dec hoping to see some leftover palettes. Alas! There were none left. I played with the tester piece for an hour and progressively fell in love with this little Purple Pandora's Box..  I asked the Assoc if they are restocking it & she told me to call in couple days when their supply truck comes in. I called but no palette. I then googled all the Ultas in a 200 mile radius and called each & every one of them only to be told the same thing, not in stock call in couple days. :'(  Then I called the Ultas in Arizona (have family there) & Ohio+Florida (friends there) thinking who would wear makeup in the searing heat of Az & Humid tropics of Fl..right? Wrong! It was sold out everywhere. I was so depressed & on the verge of tears. My husband was looking at me funny and wondering if I'd lost my marbles cos I'd never been this desperate before.  The next day Hubby dragged my depressed self to Ulta to buy the Caboodles case instead and I walked over to the GG Tester box for one last forlorn look and my hubbs exclaims, ""Hey they got one!"" I sprinted over ready to fight away contenders if needed.   Lo & behold (cue Hallelujah music) there was one single gorgeous Purple Box on the rack! The Assoc told me someone had returned it late night after I had left!!  I was shocked & overjoyed, it was a true miracle, the universe had granted me my precious. Annnnd that's how I've come in possession of this magical thang. :) The end."

I was talking about face primers initially, but then I remembered that I have an eyelid primer from elf that is extremely light. From my understanding, you're supposed to put on eye primer then a base shadow close to my skin tone. Is that right?"
brownbeauty,1t954a,whythehecknot,2,Thu Dec 19 18:30:48 2013 UTC,"For me, it depends on the effect I want. For neutral/normal make up, you can put the primer down and then whatever color you desire. If you want the color to really pop, I put down an eyeshadow primer, then I take NYX's Milk and put it on my lid, blend it,, then put on color."

brownbeauty,1t50sn,chiffonandheels,2,Wed Dec 18 02:38:03 2013 UTC,"You did a pretty good job actually! I know this sounds crazy, but the trick is blending...less.  With a cut crease, the line at the crease needs to be pretty sharp and defined. I like how you blended out the top of the crease with a different color, that's totally on the right track. The bottom of the crease isn't bad, but it should be more of a crisp line. You might try an angled brush to make a sharp line with your shadow, then just pull the color up from the top of the line to blend it out. Many people also use a pencil to cut the crease-- it's creamier and easier to work with.   Did that help any? I hope so! This is actually a really gorgeous look, just keep practicing and it'll be awesome. :)"

I'm a Beautiful Bronze/Hazelnut in Black Opal, so about NW45 (still testing it out) in the studio fix concealer.   **I've been looking up swatches and I might just need to find something in that color family, that won't look too ashy/blah on me. This blog is fantastic: Crystalis, I might be leaning more towards the Catwalk palette now."
brownbeauty,1t04l5,KelsayLilay,2,Mon Dec 16 15:40:49 2013 UTC,"Wow that blog is amazing! And the Anastasia Catwalk looks like a must have.   Lorac Pro is working great for me so far. Color payoff is decent, not super duper opaque though. Also the shimmer content is thankfully not overwhelming (like Naked) and there is minimal or no fallout. TheBalm's NudeTude has so much fallout it's a shame so much product gets wasted. :(  My favorite shadows in there are gold, Pewter & Garnet and the black is good for the corners. Although theBalm NudeTude Serious Black is a lot more jet black.  The lighter matte colors I use with a light hand for highlighting. Dark brown espresso is fab for my brows. Overall I'm very happy with Lorac Pro."

brownbeauty,1sy0zr,q_for_you,3,Sun Dec 15 18:18:45 2013 UTC,The texture of a lot of their face products and overall quality reminds me of a cross between Iman Cosmestics (back when they were mid-range and carried at Sears) and Cover FX.   I think you made a very good choice. They feel so smooth on the skin like Iman but I feel they are less irritating like CoverFX.  Enjoy!

brownbeauty,1sx141,HollaDude,3,Sun Dec 15 05:32:10 2013 UTC,Turmeric although great for your skin will stain it yellow for couple days unless you put a generous amount of oil based cream/moisturizer underneath.
brownbeauty,1sx141,jingabobo,2,Sun Dec 15 13:38:55 2013 UTC,"I do get a small tint when I apply turmeric directly to my face, but I think it's in such small amounts in the foundation that it doesn't do the same to my skin. If anyone wants to try it though I'd definitely suggest adding a small amount at a time so they don't accidentally ruin a bottle."
brownbeauty,1sx141,ManiSuccess,2,Sun Dec 15 19:10:24 2013 UTC,What about the smell? Would it sting if it went in your eyes?
brownbeauty,1sx141,nifflerqueen,1 point,Sun Dec 15 12:33:57 2013 UTC,"I added a really really small amount, like less than an 1/8 of a teaspoon for an entire bottle and mixed it in really well.

Thank you for the swatches!"
brownbeauty,1s3q17,chiffonandheels,2,Sat Dec 7 00:37:53 2013 UTC,Maybe you can use your $15/$20 off Sephora reward on this?    There are some really pigmented Milani blushes that are supposed to be part of the CVS Winter Clearance.  I might do a post with swatches of those soon for everyone on a budget.
brownbeauty,1s3q17,strawberriilove,1 point,Mon Dec 9 20:02:33 2013 UTC,You should definitely do that!  I'll have to check out my local CVS to see what's up...
brownbeauty,1s3q17,strawberriilove,2,Thu Dec 12 22:01:20 2013 UTC,"/u/strawberriilove asked me to post a mini review of this blush back in the Sephora sale haul thread and I'm finally getting around to doing it.    Please excuse the quality of the photos as the only camera I have access to is on my phone.  This is my first experience with any Nars blush and I am blown away by the quality of it.  I was not planning on buying it, but when I swatched it in store it was so pretty and showed up so well on my tan skin that I started to fall in love.  The swatches lasted through the next day through multiple handwashings, so I was expecting great lasting power, too.    I have to apply this blush with a super light hand or else it can start to look clownish.  It blends well with a big fluffy brush and lasts all day on me.  I have oily skin and touch my face a lot (unintentionally) throughout the day and it's still vibrant at the end of the day.    This color is not for the faint-hearted or anyone who wants just a flush of color.  You put this on, and it's like, ""BAM! I'm wearing makeup!""  I'm sure those with better skills could pull this off with bold eyes/lips, but I only wear this with neutral eyes and lips.   Coeur Battant is a limited edition single blush from the Guy Bourdin collection, so if you're intrigued by the color, I suggest picking it up, especially if you are looking for a bold blush that pops on darker skin.  EDIT: a word"
brownbeauty,1s3q17,strawberriilove,1 point,Wed Dec 4 20:33:20 2013 UTC,Thank you so much for doing this review!!!  That is such a lovely color on your skintone.  You mention using a big fluffy brush to apply - I may want to try this with the RT blush brush and see if that works.

brownbeauty,1ryh61,16yearold,4,Tue Dec 3 01:30:19 2013 UTC,"I used to do manual exfoliation with oatmeal and while it gave me amazing skin in the beginning, I learned that it is so easy to overdo manual exfoliation and ended up with dry, rough and irritated skin.   I am dealing with moderate PIH but I am the opposite of you though; I do not change color that quickly and the lighter I get, the redder and more obvious my PIH gets. I used the St Ives pads in the evening and the Silk Naturals Super Serum in the morning and together they did wonders on my skin. My PIH faded faster, my skin was soooo smooth and bight and had an overall glow. My forehead is around 2-3 shades darker than the rest of my face and the uneveness became less obvious with this routine.   Unfortunately, I had to stop when I ran out of both products since I can't order these in Europe :( However, I still moisturize like crazy and now wear sunscreen religiously, and this helps with the PIH as well."

brownbeauty,1ryh61,multirachael,0,Tue Dec 17 21:32:17 2013 UTC,"The best-feeling exfoliation I've done lately is...baking soda. Taking a warm shower, I used my regular gentle cleanser, rinsed, and then grabbed a small handful of baking soda, kinda worked it into a paste in my hands, and then patted it onto my face and let it sit for a little while. Then I gently massaged it off with a facial brush and rinsed well with warm water, and applied a heavy moisturizing cream when I got out of the shower. My skin still felt amazing a full day later.   It didn't make my skin feel raw or irritated, but it felt like I'd been soft-buffed to a creamy smoothness. So, so good."
brownbeauty,1ryh61,16yearold,6,Tue Dec 3 16:41:16 2013 UTC,"Please stop using baking soda! I used to this for some time too and my skin changed for the worse. It might seem okay now, but the long term damage you are causing to your skin is not worth it."

brownbeauty,1rxm46,eagleonajourney,5,Mon Dec 2 20:02:22 2013 UTC,"I'm also NC42, and I got the Ambient Lighting Palette.  I've used it with Chanel Perfection Lumiere, Shiseido Perfect Refining Foundation and YSL Touche Eclat.  I've been comparing it to the NARS Light Reflecting powder (loose), though really I've only had it a couple of weeks, so these are more ""first impressions"" than a proper review.  I'm using the palette as instructed - Dim all over, Incandescent as highlight and Radiant under my cheekbones.  I found the greatest difference with the YSL.  I go for a more matte but luminous finish, and Incandescent is really lovely.  I can't tell too much of a difference in finish with Dim vs NARS, but NARS definitely sets my concealer (YSL Touche Eclat and Inglot Cream Concealer) a lot better.  So right now, Dim is kind of a wash.  The Chanel and Shiseido foundations are less dewy in finish than YSL, so the effect is more subtle, but definitely not ""powdery"".  You honestly can't tell why you're glowing, in that it's not an obvious highlighter, but there is absolutely an effect.  I really love Incandescent over all 3 foundations.  Radiant, I have played with the least.  I tend to be heavy handed with blush (damn you bathroom lighting), and I usually skip contouring in a rush.  It shows up as a different shade on my brush, but I can't say I can see a difference on the skin.  I might try it as an all over on the weekend sometime."

brownbeauty,1rr6sw,MurielDaylight,1 point,Sat Nov 30 06:47:47 2013 UTC,"I think it's put me as something much lighter, or alternatively, I think for the last year or two I've assumed I was much darker than I am in real life."
brownbeauty,1rr6sw,vivalafaerie,2,Wed Dec 4 01:04:00 2013 UTC,"I liked my results at first but I've since hit pan on my foundation and am rethinking how it looks on me. I think the reason I was initially very happy with it was because I'd gone to Sephora one or two days prior and asked one of the makeup people there to help me find something that matched my skin. My cousin (who was with me) were repeatedly told by the person helping us that we were very dark and wow so dark much dark very skin. And then when I was putting on my new foundation at home, on my way to a temple with my family, I realized that the one I was matched with was too dark and too pink for my face. It looked ridiculous.  So when I went back and got matched with their fancy gizmo I was very pleased that I no longer looked incorrect."
brownbeauty,1rr6sw,crunkchip,2,Tue Dec 3 23:56:56 2013 UTC,"I've tried it and ended up buying entirely too much makeup! Foundation has always been the hardest for me. Too light...too dark...too pink, too brown, etc... I was matched with Makeup for Ever 173 (My Color IQ is 2Y08).  I didn't believe it since it looked like it was for much lighter skin than mine - but  she assured me that it oxidizes (whatever that means for makeup) and will match.  IT DID.   Without this, I usually end up buying things that are way too dark for me at CVS or something and end up looking like a brown piece of saran wrap was put over my face."

Already have Vintage Gold, and I love it.***  -Sephora Collection Cream Lip Stain in Always Red and Infinite Rose (Saw amazing reviews of it online, I'm majorly into Lip Stains right now! I love the idea of not having to retouch)  -Too Faced Teddy Bear Hair Kabuki Brush   -500 pt gift: the Caudalie skin set. Of course, now that I've exhausted my points, they will feature a dream gift of Nars or something, and I will weep. This happened the last time I got the Makeup Forever 500 pt perk, and within a week, Sephora came out with a 500 pt Bumble & Bumble thickening set.   ***More on Stila Magnificent Metals Foil Eyeshadow: this item (in shade Vintage Gold, a blackish gold) is va-va-voom eyes when you don't have time to do a full eye look, or you're running perpetually late to the umpteenth Indian wedding but want full drama. Though I love pure silver, their true silver shade (Comex Platinum) is wayy too chalky toned for brown skin. Ditto for their orangey gold and bronze colors...in a way, the insanely rich and thick color payoff works against darker skintones and isn't as flattering.

After I wash my hair, I massage coconut oil into my scalp and grapeseed oil into my hair; sometimes I will add a little curl lotion to it, but oil is always my first step.   Also, I didn't know about wrapping my hair until I was, like, 20. Turns out your pillow case can soak up that oil outta your hair, and wearing a wrap or bonnet keeps it locked in."
brownbeauty,1psoi4,deliriousmintii,2,Sun Nov 3 15:27:03 2013 UTC,"I feel like this article kind of glosses over information but doesn't delve deeper. Its kind of a annoying trait that happens with a lot of blogs. -___- Overall for similar info of those 4 categories, I will list my favorite blogs on hair that talks about these topics. www.thenaturalhavenbloom.com This blog is really cool because the woman who writes it is a scientist and goes into a more in depth analysis than usual of the hair products and why each ingredient is so beneficial or harmful for hair! She also has a lot of cool posts of split end hair up close and hair porosity. www.naturallycurly.com  This is a very well fleshed out website of all kinds of information from hairstyles, to curly-friendly salons, to products, and more! This is great. And last my favorite www.curlynikki.com Nikki is very popular, and she has lots of posts about hair, hair care, hair politics, and other blog musings. I really like how she posts about other ladies and their hair journey because it gives a great perspective."

brownbeauty,1pfibb,strawberriilove,4,Tue Oct 29 00:56:50 2013 UTC,"I'm NW43 (ish) in MAC, and these are some of my faves -   Tarte Blushing Bride.  It's a light plum that looks amazingly natural on medium-deep skin. NARS Taj Mahal.  Although it's orange in the pan, use a light hand and it'll give you a wonderful glow. NARS Seduction.  It's a deep plummy wine red color, and it's great for fall/winter.   Honestly I found the best results by just going into stores and swatching colors, and trying things I didn't think would suit me.  I never thought I would be able to pull off orange blush, but it's lovely for a lot of people! * NYX Cream Blush in Red Cheeks - this might be what you're looking for.  Although it's red in the pan, it blends out to a nice even ""natural"" look.  My skin is super dry during fall/winter, so it's a really nice product to wear this time of year!  I find that a lot of people have theories about what colors ""work"" and ""don't work"" for brown ladies - it's all pretty much bullshit in my opinion.   There are a lot of colors and shades we can all pull off - you gotta experiment to find out!"
brownbeauty,1pfibb,Lotorious,2,Tue Oct 29 01:55:45 2013 UTC,I love Tarte's blushes because they're highly pigmented so they actually show up on dark skin. I have Dollface and Natural Beauty. I'm considering getting Blushing Bride as well.
brownbeauty,1pfibb,fatpinkchicken,1 point,Tue Oct 29 03:42:28 2013 UTC,"I'm NC42 and I use a Bare Minerals blush in ""Dusk,""  Bobbi Brown's Pot Rouge for Lips & Cheeks in Calypso Coral (good summer blush) and sometimes Lush's ""Charisma"" tint. The tint is more of a bronze color and looks good when paired with a more pink blush."

brownbeauty,1pfibb,KT17,1 point,Wed Oct 30 11:27:40 2013 UTC,"No idea what my MAC colour is but I use this shade in Smashbox.   With blush I toggle between;   Clinique in Smouldering Plum, which looks shimmery in the pan but doesn't actually shimmer on skin and is a more mature and natural colour (fall/winter) E.L.F. in Rich Rose, a bronzy pink colour that works great for me in the summer. Etude House Lovely Cookie Blusher in #7 which, like the Clinique, is shimmery in the pan but not on skin and is a gorgeous pink for spring.   That being said, the biggest thing I  have learned is you need to have a good brush to give any product the best chance to work. I have been able to use products that have been reviewed neutral/badly for pigmentation (like this one) just by disregarding the included brush or puff and using my own. My only advice is no matter what you go for, invest in a great brush (I use Hakuhodo's Large Yachiyo but more seem to recommend their Pointed Yachiyo).  Best of luck :)"

brownbeauty,1p2t9n,fatpinkchicken,4,Wed Oct 23 21:13:12 2013 UTC,Hmm looks very similar to Smashbox's nylon nude. If you want a cheaper option then try revlon's sandalwood beige (maybe a tad darker and is a bit peachy). If you don't want to spend any money then try using your concealer or foundation with a bit of lip balm  (or gloss) mixed in. Kerry's lip color looks so similar to her face color that I would try the foundation trick first to see if I liked it.
brownbeauty,1p2t9n,bigpuffyclouds,4,Thu Oct 24 15:48:02 2013 UTC,That's a really good idea w/ the foundation. I'll have to try it. I just like how it doesn't wash her out. Whenever I've tried a nude lip I tend to look dead.
brownbeauty,1p2t9n,bigpuffyclouds,4,Thu Oct 24 19:47:27 2013 UTC,I just like how it doesn't wash her out. Whenever I've tried a nude lip I tend to look dead.   Yeah it happens to me as well. I've found that lining my lips with a lip liner that is one shade darker than the lip stick takes care of that problem (but make sure that you blend and smudge the lip liner with lip brush/Qtip into the lip stick really well so that I don't have a 90s obvious lip liner thing going on)
brownbeauty,1p2t9n,frumperbell,1 point,Thu Oct 24 20:56:35 2013 UTC,Rosedew's probably a closer match but fyi its got sparkles in case you don't want shimmer.  Sparkling Cider is a good one too.

brownbeauty,1ozpuw,fatpinkchicken,4,Tue Oct 22 18:17:50 2013 UTC,Clinique's Baked Bronzer and Benefit's Watt's Up. Love them both! Especially the bronzer.
brownbeauty,1ozpuw,Sakhmett,4,Wed Oct 23 01:11:48 2013 UTC,"Sleek Contour Kit (so cheap but so good), you can get it in Medium or Dark. Nars Casino (great contour colour)  Any of the benefit highlighters.  I have a million highlighters that I love. Sun Beam (benefit) and Mary Loumanizer (TheBalm) are great ones."
brownbeauty,1ozpuw,90seconds,1 point,Wed Oct 23 12:30:29 2013 UTC,That Sleek contour kit looks amazing. Would you recommend it in dark or medium? It looks really dark.   I have one of their blushes and love it.
brownbeauty,1ozpuw,90seconds,1 point,Wed Oct 23 21:08:49 2013 UTC,"I would recommend dark. I am a lighter medium complexion so depending on where you fall you can make a good call. Personally, I love both dark and medium depending on the look I want."
brownbeauty,1ozpuw,bananatree12,2,Thu Oct 24 13:36:45 2013 UTC,"I think you did a pretty good job. It's not super obvious that you contoured/highlighted so that's awesome!   The only suggestion I would give is about the shadows under your eyes. It might be the lighting, but since the area directly below your eyes is darker than you cheekbones it throws off the effect a bit. I would suggest trying a heavier concealer in that area. Other than that I think it looks really good!"
brownbeauty,1ozpuw,frumperbell,1 point,Tue Oct 22 18:42:12 2013 UTC,Thanks! Any recs on concealer? I currently use the Garnier Skin Renew Anti Dark Eye Roller: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003RF82RI/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

brownbeauty,1ozpuw,asesina_,2,Tue Oct 22 23:34:03 2013 UTC,"Nice subtle effect.  It doesn't look very Kardashian (for lack of a better term), but looking at your before there's a definite difference.  When I contour I use Black Radiance bronzer in Gingersnap and for highlight I use either Milani's Luminoso or one of the Illuminating Face Powders.  I think I have Amber Nectar and Hermosa Rose."
brownbeauty,1ozpuw,chiffonandheels,3,Tue Oct 22 22:30:46 2013 UTC,"I agree with frumper - your contouring is nice, but subtle. If you're looking for a more defined line (a la Kardashian), you can go for a brown blush.  I use M.A.C's powder blush in Blunt when I want to make really defined cheekbones."
brownbeauty,1ozpuw,oldhaunts_,2,Wed Oct 23 00:48:35 2013 UTC,"I'm not very tan, but a friend recommended using Mac Melon pigment on cheekbones over a traditional highlighter, shes a beautiful bronze complexion and the shimmer really makes her face pop!"
brownbeauty,1ozpuw,multirachael,2,Wed Oct 23 02:18:36 2013 UTC,"Wahaha that before picture is precious!   Have you tried to use a salmon/orange based concealer that's a bit darker than your skin tone to cover up your undereyes/darker areas? Once those areas are balanced, it's much easier to notice highlighting and contouring. Hyperpigmentation when covered with just concealer or foundation tends to show up ashy, and tends to draw the eye. By using a color corrector, the darker areas are then easily highlighted or contoured!   Does that help any?"
brownbeauty,1oy2wn,chiffonandheels,4,Tue Oct 22 01:33:10 2013 UTC,Replace lipsticks? I've never had any lipstick that I've liked to keep enough to know when/if they go bad. I just purchased 3 that I'm in love with and want to know if there is a time frame within which I will need to replace them.
brownbeauty,1oy2wn,seirianstar,4,Tue Oct 22 04:26:58 2013 UTC,"When they smell bad.  I've never used one up yet.  I either lose them, or I had them so long they smell like crayons."
brownbeauty,1oy2wn,frumperbell,3,Tue Oct 22 12:36:15 2013 UTC,So lipsticks if kept long enough will smell like crayons? And when they smell like crayons it's time to replace?
brownbeauty,1oy2wn,seirianstar,2,Tue Oct 22 18:19:38 2013 UTC,"Yup.  I don't remember where I first heard it, but I found it to be true.  I stopped doing anything more than moisturizing and putting on lip gloss (only for super special occasions) for something like 4-5 years.  When I went through my lipsticks to look for fall colors, all the old ones from Before smelt like crayons.  I actually sniffed a crayon and then one of my newer lipsticks to make sure I wasn't imagining things."

brownbeauty,1jarf5,mcpagal,2,Sun Sep 1 14:30:05 2013 UTC,"The best advice I can give is to actually use it dark-colored liner when you're using nude lipstick. Coffee colored liner or a dark brown will work wonderfully with nude lipsticks available in any range because they help transition that light lipstick color into your darker skin.  That said, this means that your investment should be both in a new color and a dark colored liner. If you find this liner method works then the entire range of nude lipsticks that you thought you were previously unable to wear should become available to you.   This also means that you can try out drugstore lipsticks and find a new shade that you like. Once found, you can take the shade to your high-end stores like Mac or sephora and find a high-quality lipstick there if you're looking for one."

You may like to try Jane Carter Nutrient Replenishing Solution, or Afrigenix Berrilicious Smoothie. If you have the time, allow your hair to air dry, and apply your favorite oil. If you‚Äôre short on time, proceed to blow dry.   Part your hair in 4 sections, and clip to hold. Use your comb to create a part that is approximately one inch wide and one inch deep. If you don‚Äôt want your parts to be pronounced, don‚Äôt spend too much time on defining your parts. Divide the parted section into two. Separate a handful of the HAVANA TWIST HAIR (tm), use 6 strips to achieve the size pictured. Fold the HAVANA TWIST HAIR (tm) in half, and place it as pictured in picture number 6. Beginning on the side closest to your hairline, twist the HAVANA TWIST HAIR (tm) in with your own natural hair, clockwise. Do the same with the other half. Now, begin to cross the twisted sections over each other in a counter-clockwise direction. Repeat this crossing over, down the whole length of the twist. Twist by crossing over, until you reach the end of the twist.   Repeat this step throughout the remainder of your head.  12.-13. Roll small squares of aluminum foil into mini rod shapes.   Use the mini rods as you would a flexirod, on the end of each twist. Very carefully (and at your own discretion, and risk) dip the ends of the hair in very, very hot water. You may want to have someone help you with this step. Allow the hair to cool off completely before gently removing the foil rods. Clip any stray ends.   ENJOY"

brownbeauty,1i5d2m,darktigress,5,Fri Jul 12 13:50:56 2013 UTC,The no no! is the dumbest product ever. My sister has it and it's just a thin wire that burns the hair. It does NOTHING to reduce hair growth anything. Save your money and get laser hair removal which actually works.

Light application of the lip stain and either the 275 or 418 give a light pink or coral look that I neutral and bright at the same time :)

brownbeauty,1i1qxs,ijobuby,1 point,Thu Jul 11 02:18:06 2013 UTC,I recently bought Mac's So Chaud and I LOVE it. When applied lightly it looks like a coral stain and stays on for quite a while without reapplying. It also fades nicely. When I go full on it's bright coral. It's my new favorite summer thing to wear.
brownbeauty,1i1qxs,tooptoop,1 point,Thu Jul 11 03:27:10 2013 UTC,"definitely recommend trying revlon colorburst lip butter in tutti frutti. it might look a little intimidatingly orange in the tube, but it goes on sheer so you can build it up at your discretion. so you can go from anything between a soft coral to bright orange, and it'll all look pretty! it's also very soft and moisturizing, which is something i love, but be careful with carrying it around in the summer-- if it gets too hot, it'll melt."

They have an even more orangey shade called Rendezvous too. The colors are nicely buildable and stay put for a pretty long time to boot.

I've always wanted to try a blush, but every time I tried one I looked too dolled up. This blush doesn't and I will happily buy it again.  ELF eyelid primer is awesome and it's cheap!

It is very greasy, and my eyeshadow slid off in the same amount of time as without a base. It's just pointless for me.  Maybe I should give it a few more tries before I write it off, and actually give the primer a try too."
brownbeauty,1hp9t1,seirianstar,1 point,Sat Jul 6 02:17:22 2013 UTC,Would you say you prefer the Urban Decay Primer over Elf? I'm trying to decide which to get and was leaning towards UD.
brownbeauty,1hp9t1,Cerikal,1 point,Sat Jul 6 01:58:30 2013 UTC,"UDPP definitely lasts much longer. I have UDPP in Sin, and though I like it I don't think I'd repurchase it because it is very pigmented and I already have powder shadows that are similar to it in color. I use it more like a cream eyeshadow and it makes any shadow I layer on it very shimmery (which I do love). I can't say anything for the original UDPP as I've never used it. The Elf one leave a bit of a white cast on my skin so unless I completely cover it with shadow it looks awkward. It does hold up very well though and I haven't experience any makeup meltdown with it despite it costing only $1. If it'll help at all, here's an article comparing different primers from other brands as well:  http://www.beautylish.com/a/vxywv/best-eye-shadow-primers"
brownbeauty,1hffw0,flajourn,5,Mon Jul 1 14:58:33 2013 UTC,"Personally, I love their lipsticks.  They have a slight vanilla scent and they come in a ton of finishes (they have mattes, satins, cremesheens, etc.)  Some of my favorites are Russian Red and Rebel.  A lot of people like their mineralized skin finishes as well.  Some of them can be used as blush, highlighter, or even a regular face powder."

When I first bought it, I was looking for a nice tinted moisturizer so I wouldn't have to wear so much powder foundation, so this really saved me from a world of struggle with face foundations. It's light, it blends in well with my MAC concealer, and it makes my skin look glowing, but matte at the same time!  I also LOVE their lipsticks. I have a thing for super dark lipsticks (even some black/grey shades), and I haven't had any troubles with their lipsticks. Well, not nearly any troubles. Sometimes their Russian Red stains my lips, but I think that's because some matte lipsticks don't sit right on my lips. Oh well, I still love them anyway! Haha"

brownbeauty,1gyrjb,Froolio,2,Tue Jun 25 21:55:56 2013 UTC,"YES YES YES, wordflapdragon knows! Also, if you like using it in your hair and find that you get pimples along your forehead or hairline, it's probably the oil in your hair causing it.

brownbeauty,1gyrjb,moorebeauty,3,Thu Jun 27 15:44:04 2013 UTC,"Well everyone has given great advice thus far. I use my coconut oil a little differently. I treat my hair and skin the same way..and i have yielded great results so far. Six days per week i use a very rich moisturizing soap like dove, olay or caress. On the seventh dy i like to clarify my skin with a strong soap like black soap...or anything that really gets rid of everything. On that day..i prepoo my skin with coconut oil. I rub it all over...and then shower.   As far as using it for lotion goes, i prefer to mix it with my regular lotion and then apply it to my skin. I rub it in for a few minutes and that minimizes most of the shine. If you put it on thirty or so mins before  leaving the house all the shine should be gone."

brownbeauty,1gxypu,strawberriilove,13,Mon Jun 24 02:11:48 2013 UTC,"Oh my god, I think color correcting is my calling. I posted in MUA a few months ago about my color correcting B/A (link here) and I'm a huge advocate of drugstore makeup.   These are my lifesaving products- keep in mind that although I am a medium/deep (tan) skin tone, the following correctors can work wonders for darker  and lighter skin tones.    L'Oreal Color Correcting Primer in Medium/Deep NYX's Concealer in a Jar in Orange Concealer Palette   These products may be cheap, but the amount of correction to the face is astounding.   The first product is something I use everyday. I take about half a pump onto the back of my hand and go around my undereye/eye area, my muzzle discoloration and my hyperpigmented birthmarks on my face. A light, targeted layer of this instantly brightens the skin, and often times it will be enough after foundation to cancel out discoloration.   For days where I have slept less, or woken up after being dehydrated, the orange pot concealer is my best friend. I will blend this orange with a lighter skin tone concealer from the palette to create a custom correcting shade for concealing. The palette also has some peach-y tones but I find they are too light for me. When mixed, the concealer becomes this beautiful smooth and creamy formula that can be layered (lightly!) to avoid creasing, but to create a flawless finish. That concealer palette is also incredibly helpful for contouring/highlighting.

brownbeauty,1gtf9s,wordflapdragon,4,Fri Jun 21 20:34:39 2013 UTC,"Switching to threading from waxing was the best decision I made for my eyebrows, I find that it's a much cleaner line and you can have a lot more influence over the shape you end up with. Mind you, I've been having it done for six years now and I still find my eyes water a little, so be aware of that! Let us know how it goes :)"
brownbeauty,1gtf9s,tashadocus,5,Fri Jun 21 20:44:58 2013 UTC,"I absolutely love the way my eyebrows look when they're threaded. Much cleaner, more defined lines and looks nicer longer than when I get them waxed."
brownbeauty,1gtf9s,recycledpaper,2,Fri Jun 21 21:00:55 2013 UTC,My eyebrows look so much better after being threaded. Waxing caused me to get little bumps on my eyebrows. It looked awful.
brownbeauty,1gtf9s,caramelsundae02,2,Fri Jun 21 22:19:57 2013 UTC,I LOVE threading. Eyebrows always look so clean and amazing. Plus waxing tugs at the skin anyway. It can make it sag
brownbeauty,1gtf9s,HollaDude,1 point,Mon Jun 24 23:15:02 2013 UTC,"Threading looks really clean and it doesn't really hurt either. Just feels like a sharp pluck, and it's over in a few mins!  If you have ultra sensitive skin like me, I suggest you bring along a little bit of aloe vera or cold cream to rub on them after. My skin gets red and tender for a while afterwards not as badly as with waxing)so the aloe helps a lot."

Rimmel London Lash Accelerator (literally makes your lashes grow longer and thicker if you use it often! But you could get the same effect with the serum and your choice of mascara!)
brownbeauty,1gnqzi,aztecaprincess927,2,Wed Jun 19 20:49:47 2013 UTC,"personally devoted to covergirl lashblast, specifically the one for volume-- it's in an orange tube. perfection. my lashes are naturally pretty long, but this makes them look full as well-- and it only needs one or two applications! it's never given me any issues with clumping, either, which is an added perk. currently wearing the waterproof version, and it's living up to the name thus far.  i've tried lashblast fusion before, but it just didn't look as good in comparison. definitely surprised about clump crusher, i was debating on getting it a few weeks ago from all the rave reviews-- thanks for the heads up!"
brownbeauty,1gnqzi,thefinalproblem,2,Wed Jun 19 17:07:24 2013 UTC,"Now, telescopic explosion is the mascara with the small round ball type applicator right? I had it in waterproof and I loved the application- it delivered the perfect amount of product to both the hard to reach lashes (bottom lashes and lashes closer to the tear duct)  I quit using it though because waterproof mascara is TOO MUCH and I can't. I might pick it up in the normal formula though!"
brownbeauty,1gnqzi,chiffonandheels,1 point,Wed Jun 19 17:27:54 2013 UTC,Yep! That's the one. And I don't do waterproof anymore for the same reasons. The regular formula is perfect-- stays on until you don't want it to anymore.

brownbeauty,1fozpi,lavenderapple,7,Wed Jun 5 01:57:33 2013 UTC,"Henna will be a bust.  I'm an Indian girl with jet black hair with lots of Indian friends with jet black hair. We've all tried henna directly on the hair at some point. And for ALL of us, regardless of hair texture, our hair remained black in almost all lighting. HOWEVER, when we went out into bright sunlight, you could see a reddish-brown sheen to our hair. But it was still notably black.  THAT SAID, I have one South Asian friend who successfully dyed her hair a kind of dark burgundy following this Youtube video. Her hair is gorgeous.  edit for clarification"
brownbeauty,1fozpi,obidasin,2,Wed Jun 5 18:00:54 2013 UTC,"Aw darn, this is disappointing to hear. :( Just bought a pack of henna a few hours ago, haha. Oh well, I suppose I can still use it for its supposed amazing conditioning benefits! A reddish-brown sheen to my hair in bright sunlight, being that it's summer, would be pretty swell too.  The girl in that Youtube video has gorgeous hair! My next best possible option is box dying, I suppose. I'm looking into trying out a Japanese brand of hair dyes specially formulated to work on dark Asian hair, and it seems to work successfully on many people of East Asian descent, but I'm wondering if there's some subtle difference in the black hair of South Asians versus the black hair of East Asians, generally speaking. For example, I know hair structure is different, but I'm wondering about colors of undertones... I get the feeling that East Asian hair is a little browner and somewhat easier to lighten, but I'm not too sure. I really want to try it out as a one-time thing, hope it doesn't damage my hair too much because that's really my only worry as far as dying my hair. I guess it wouldn't damage my hair as much as going to a salon and getting a dye job, as box dyes contain fewer chemicals.  Thanks for your input!"
brownbeauty,1fozpi,MALNOURISHED_DOG,1 point,Wed Jun 5 20:40:56 2013 UTC,"Uh, just saying, but I'm pretty sure that box dye works for jet black hair. I am East Asian and all the females in my family dye their black as night hair (we have very very black hair). Granted its only a brown or reddish brown color, but I'm pretty sure that's what you want."
brownbeauty,1fozpi,HollaDude,1 point,Tue Jun 25 08:41:05 2013 UTC,"Yea henna does very little for black hair in terms of dying. BUT, mix it with amla, shikakai and some tulsi powder with water and some form of protein and oil. Your hair will feel amazing after. Just make a thick paste out of it"
brownbeauty,1fkoum,lennonade,3,Mon Jun 3 11:03:25 2013 UTC,"I'm not sure how much you're willing to spend, but the Urban Decay Naked 2 palette is awesome and I use it to make both everyday looks and special looks that I regularly get complimented on!

brownbeauty,1fkoum,Daneelbel_Lee,3,Tue Jun 4 14:34:41 2013 UTC,"You did not mention how much you were willing to spend, but you don't have to get everything at once. I also don't know how you look right now, but I'll try my best!   Eyeshadow primer: My life would not exist without an eyeshadow primer!! I love Urban Decay's primer potion as well as Too Faced Shadow insurance. Both are around $20 and they last me forever.  Mascara: I love mascara, because I think it really finishes the look. I am not one of those girls that thinks they need to have expensive mascara though. I LOVE Hard Candy's Curl up & dye as well as the L'oreal Voluminous Mascara (the purple tube).  Brow pencil: I'm not sure what your brows look like, if they're filled or what. But my fave is MAC Spiked for my skin color. It keeps me looking natural and helps me define my brow and then highlight to really let my almond shape eyes show through.  A good pallette!! Urban Decay really gets a good bang for your buck on their pallettes because you can experiment and experience so many different colors that you would not usually use anyway. I'm still using their pallettes from 2-3 yrs ago that is still amazing in pigment. When they have a sale it's even better because you could make a killing with 40% off. Naked 2 is awesome, but they have other that are less neutral and more colorful. Good backups are HiP Duos from L'oreal and they really help you understand how to match up some shades (inner v & outer v) and you could just experiment with highlighting"
brownbeauty,1fkoum,Daneelbel_Lee,1 point,Mon Jun 3 22:22:27 2013 UTC,"I added a picture to give you an idea of what I would need makeup-wise. I'd skip the brow stuff as my eyebrows are pretty well-defined as is, but I'm loving all the palette recommendations! Thank you."
brownbeauty,1fkoum,Daneelbel_Lee,3,Tue Jun 4 08:37:11 2013 UTC,"A good highlighting powder is always nice; you can use it for your inner corners to brighten up your eyes a bit, put a little on your cheeks and cupid's bow to  define those areas, and just use it as a general highlighter. I don't know if they sell it anymore, but Kimora Lee Simmons chocolate shimmer powder is perfect for my skin tone, and it's got an amazing smell."
brownbeauty,1fkoum,TheYellowRose,2,Tue Jun 4 00:11:14 2013 UTC,"Interesting...I've never even heard of highlighting powder before. Do you have any other recommendations regarding face stuff, e.g. blush, foundation, etc? How does blush look on brown girls?"
brownbeauty,1fkoum,Daneelbel_Lee,2,Tue Jun 4 08:38:55 2013 UTC,"It depends on your skin's tones. You want to complement your skin colour, while bringing out your undertones. I remember seeing this blush guide; hopefully it can help you!  Also, depending on what type of look you're going for, contouring your face and defining your brows can go a loooooong way. I'll try to find some helpful diagrams in a few hours."
brownbeauty,1fkoum,p4ssingfors4ne,1 point,Tue Jun 4 12:25:38 2013 UTC,"Thanks for the guide. I added a picture to the original post, would you say tawny or beige?"
brownbeauty,1fkoum,p4ssingfors4ne,2,Tue Jun 4 12:38:14 2013 UTC,"No problem!   I'd say a nice tawny, but that could be the photo. Either way, you've got a whole hell of a lot of range with colours.   If you have one, maybe a picture in natural light, so we can see your skin's undertones?"
brownbeauty,1fiw87,HollaDude,9,Sun Jun 2 16:25:23 2013 UTC,"Foundations tend to make people of color look ashy because it's generally the wrong undertone. I find that darker skin generally has a yellow undertone, although we look better in warm colors. That said, when using a foundation from a drugstore, look for ones that seem a bit more sallow rather than pink.   Another way to combat this ashy-ness is to use a color corrector. This product when applied properly (that is, to the areas of the skin that are prone to hyperpigmentation such as under the eyes, around the mouth, etc) is a life-saver in helping revitalize the skin before foundation application.   Color correction needs to be one of the staple things that darker skin tones do because it's a step that does wonders for us! Being prone to hyperpigmentation and uneven skin tone is just a fact of life, but not a fact of life we can't cover up!   Hope I helped!"
brownbeauty,1fiw87,chiffonandheels,2,Sun Jun 2 21:02:57 2013 UTC,"With drugstore foundations its tough because you can't test it before you buy it (unless you're like my Mexican mother who does so anyways, lol) so it can easily be hit or miss, but with high end foundation you can test it and see if it matches. There are websites that match all types of foundations together based on the colors."
brownbeauty,1fiw87,aztecaprincess927,2,Sun Jun 2 20:07:17 2013 UTC,"So Im pretty new to foundation as well, but Ive come to terms with the higher end brands fitting me better than drugstore brands, with the exception of IMAN's line. Too bad I'd have to drive almost an hour to find a Walgreens with her brand in it, which I will never do! haha.... Anyway, here are some tips I've found helpful to me. Your results may vary - so keep that in mind!  ASK FOR SAMPLES!!- If you find yourself in a Sephora or MAC store, ask for samples! I still haven't purchased a full size foundation, but Ive really taken a liking to mixing MAC's Mineral Moisture (NW50) and Lancome's Teint Idole Ultra (510). But I just got a sample of NARS Pure Radiant Tinted Moisturizer for the warmer/humid weather Im about to encounter.  MIXING SHADES- Ive learned that mixing can also help. Ive been mixing those 2 foundations I mentioned above for a perfect match. This may also help when purchasing drugstore foundations. You could match as close as you can and then later on purchase one a shade or 2 lighter and mix!   UNDERTONES -Also, dont forget about finding your undertones!! I found this video to be quite helpful. (I feel like Im an advocate for this particular youtube-er, but she has been SOOO helpful to me! - even though we dont have the exact same complextion/skin tone) I would say that this may sound like your issue and seems very important to correct color and promote an even skin tone!  Hope this helps!"

brownbeauty,1f09xe,aladdinsprincess,2,Sat May 25 02:38:02 2013 UTC,"Okay. I was in this position about 14months ago. Do you use a wide tooth comb? Is your hair wavy like mine is? I used morrocan oil shampoo and conditioner until I felt it was healthier at which point I switched to one n only morrocan oil shampoo and conditioner. When you condition, run a wide tooth comb before you rinse out. My hair isn't quite as healthy as I want it but it's leagues better than before. A wide tooth comb is a savior."
brownbeauty,1f09xe,bigpuffyclouds,1 point,Sat May 25 02:50:29 2013 UTC,"I use a wide tooth comb after I've rinsed the conditioner out to detangle. Ill start using it while I have conditioner in. I have 14 months till my wedding and I would love to have hair that long!!   It's red right now so ill have to dye it once more to get it to my natural colour, but I'm going to try to let it grow out as much as possible or at least until it starts to look ridiculous with 2 different colors lol. Ill report back in 14 months with an update haha."

You might try some argan oil based products (especially deep conditioners, which help revive hair after its been dyed.)  I also try not to heat treat my hair as much now that my hair is okay! I hope this helped a little bit!"
brownbeauty,1f09xe,Sakhmett,2,Sat May 25 15:39:49 2013 UTC,I am! Thanks darling!!   I've always dyed my hair for as long as I can remember. I've been on a redhead kick for about a year. One more dye job to my natural colour and I'm done. I've been using coconut oil in my hair and its been good so far. I just haven't seen much growth :( ill keel trying.

brownbeauty,1en6k3,chiffonandheels,1 point,Sun May 19 21:44:14 2013 UTC,You're so right! I usually use a taupey color or a medium brown but we didn't this time since it was so bright. I thought it would mute the color a bit. I'll try it next time. Thanks!

There usually isn't enough SPF in a combination of the two to make it worth using. There are a bunch of recs in a recent post on this subreddit, or if you want more information the people at /r/skincareaddiction are very smart.   Eta: or /r/naturalbeauty."

It's not greasy, works well under makeup, and leaves no white cast. If you're in the US it's only $21 on amazon.

brownbeauty,1e78dm,real-rainicorn,1 point,Sun May 12 21:14:20 2013 UTC,Thanks!! Do you have any in particular that you really like?
brownbeauty,1e78dm,real-rainicorn,3,Sun May 12 21:20:13 2013 UTC,"I've used a few    biore aqua rich watery essence spf 50+ this feels and looks like nothing at all, it takes only a few seconds to absorb. It's got mini water beads in it that burst (?) upon contact with the skin so it feels very cooling and refreshing.   Biore perfect face milk spf 50+ There's several versions of these and the perfect face for super oily skin and it definitely works, it makes an amazing primer for make-up. But it can be quite drying because of the high alcohol content. I think it clogged me a little too but pretty much everything does.   Mentholatum skin aqua moisture milk spf 50+ This is slightly moisturising, it's alcohol, oil and fragrance free so it's suitable for sensitive skin. It's also got skincare benefits in it like hyaluronic acid, vit B5, E and a C derivative. It dries to semi-matte finish, so it's not greasy despite being moisturising. Takes a few mins to sink though and makes an ok primer. I think it gives my skin a slight 'glow' but idk, maybe I'm seeing things  Garnier sheer protect - This dries to a matte finish, doesn't take long to sink in and has I think 4/5 star UVA rating. Which is really really good. Didn't get a chance to use this for long.  My favourite was the perfect face milk because I have oily skin, I used to wear it at night when I went out because of how good a primer it was but I had to stop using it  honestly.. they're all pretty much the same in how good they are, no white cast and non-greasy, it just depends on what you're looking for."
brownbeauty,1e78dm,Jnnlopez,1 point,Sun May 12 21:44:53 2013 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed response. I should have been more detailed in my post!   I don't want to break the bank on a sunblock, but I'd be willing to get over that if the product worked well enough. I have normal-dry skin, but I don't wear foundation, so so-so primers are acceptable.   I might start with the Garnier or Biore since they're likely to be easier to find. Thanks again!"

brownbeauty,1e78dm,dancesontrains,1 point,Mon May 13 16:06:10 2013 UTC,"I know! The EWG rankings make me nervous too. They red flag all chemical sunscreens, I've noticed. The one that works best for me is the one by laroche posay (anthelios). It's non greasy, doesn't make me breakout and helps keep my makeup on. I think it's rated 4 on EWG. They also have a mineral sunscreen but I haven't tried that out."
brownbeauty,1e78dm,wordflapdragon,1 point,Sun May 12 22:45:11 2013 UTC,"I was reading into the ratings further and I noticed some interesting criticisms of EWG. Unfortunately, I can't find any that are on sites that don't seem to be as alarmist as EWG themselves (example). I found another link but it was written by cosmetic chemists - not sure if they're the most unbiased resource, either.   I don't mind spending more on healthier options. But the thing about the all-natural sunscreens is that they seem to be the worst at leaving weird sheens on my skin that make them unwearable. It's sad that price is negotiable but my vanity isn't...but that's how the cookie crumbles, I guess.   Thanks for the recommendation. I'm going to look into it!"

brownbeauty,1dwyrf,SupersonicMotivated,2,Wed May 8 09:12:17 2013 UTC,"Just be assertive.  Your foundation should catch the highlights in your skintone (in my opinion). It shouldn't be super light where it gives you a line on your chin, but since foundation tends to darken after application, I like to adjust for that by going a bit lighter. Sometimes, if the person matching you is not a person of color, they go too dark.  So look around for your yourself, pick out some options, rather than just waiting for them to pick for you.  I personally love Makeup Forever foundation, fwiw."
brownbeauty,1dwyrf,htesfai,1 point,Wed May 8 21:22:50 2013 UTC,They actually have some new program at my sephora in Philly where they use some machine thingy and hold it up to your skin and then it perfectly matches you to so many foundations. It's amazing!! Has anyone else tried it? I'm not sure if this is available everywhere? But seriously it's the best and then they email you your shade in pretty much every foundation they have!   PS i vote Nars sheer glow or Perfekt or Hourglass(for foundation). And for concealer I love Benefit's fake up or the Mac mineralize or pro long wear concealer and definitely get Bobbi's Brown's corrector to layer underneath.

brownbeauty,1dwyrf,fivetenths,1 point,Wed May 8 18:06:10 2013 UTC,"Some of the associates do a fantastic job matching and taking into consideration your needs and wants. When I went in to find a foundation, it took a few days but an associate helped me narrow it down to my current foundation. When I went to go buy it though a few weeks later (vacation got in the way of getting it the first time), another associate talked me out of the original colour and matched me to something else.   When the Pantone IQ machine was rolled out, it matched me back to the original colour that the first associate matched me to. Basically that machine is awesome.   I would highly recommend though trying to get a sample or have them do your whole face so that you can see it from all angles and figure out it's coverage rather than just dealing with swatches."

brownbeauty,1d1g5p,SupersonicMotivated,5,Wed Apr 24 22:06:22 2013 UTC,"I'm right between a Sephora and an Ulta on a daily basis so I promised I'd do some down-low, in-store swatching on darker skin!  There were some very pretty colors, and the palette is affordable at $20. But I wouldn't put it in my ""must have"" category, per se.  Being a brown girl, every palette has colors that are too light or ashy for me. Here, the ""base"" colors (bottom two) are clearly for very light skin.  Even as a brow highlight, I prefer something more golden, not blinding white.  The baby blue color (second to last on the right) looks very yellow-green on my skin. I even reapplied it twice to make sure it didn't mix with any other color.  But no, it just turns neon green for some reason.  The purple looked great. Sorry, I did it quickly and so the prettiest color is too close to my knuckles! lol. Next time, I'll swatch on my inner arm.    That said, I wouldn't have minded purchasing it, but my Ulta was actually out of them! The tester was all that was left.  So, instead,  I just bought some random Nyx Pearl Eyeshadows' (swatches in the link).  I absolutely love their pearl pots.  All Nyx eye makeup was on sale, buy 1 get the other 50% off. I paid under $10 for four eyeshadows (I forgot to swatch the Purple Roll On Shimmer that I bought.  So thanks for giving me an excuse to go play with makeup! I'll take requests for any future Stealthy Swatches! Since I'm not obligated to buy them, we can be creative!  Edit: Swatched the Nyx colors and the Blue is pretty close to the Lorac pretty ocean blue."
brownbeauty,1d1g5p,Daneelbel_Lee,3,Wed Apr 24 22:31:27 2013 UTC,Oh I just realized I have one of those NYX pearl loose powders! I'm gonna dig it up and find the name.

Then, if you consider the price point, I'm floored by this brand!  Only thing is don't expect too much catchy marketing from that cosmetic brand. The colors are named like ""Pink"", ""Blue"", ""Orange"". LOL. Not even tryna be creative!"

I think it is a very interesting palette, but looking at your swatch (and you have a similar skin tone to mine), I don't know if it is a must buy for me either.   The purple is lovely, though.   I don't know wtf is going on with that green/blue...that's so weird."
brownbeauty,1d1g5p,Daneelbel_Lee,1 point,Thu Apr 25 00:26:31 2013 UTC,"Yeah, I was confused about the green/blue.  I just wish there were more palettes made for brown skin.  For example, I'd use #3 or #7 as a highlight.  The #1 brown could be a base color.  I'd keep the blues (#4 and #5) and the #7 purple.  Then, I'd add a gold tone, a rust color (like the Nyx) and a matte rose/burgundy color for the crease.  Does anyone know of a palette like that?"

Also you are awesome for following through on this thank you so much. That purple has me rollllling. I think I might pick it up. Thank youuuuuu!  Looking at this again it looks like the only colors that were true to the palette were the first two blue shades and that gorgeous purple. I wonder if something in the pigment is interacting with your skin? Hmmm.
brownbeauty,1d1g5p,Daneelbel_Lee,2,Thu Apr 25 05:39:45 2013 UTC,"YESSSSS! did you turn your shutter sound off for true spy stealth?!   Hahaha! I did!! I was coming from work, so I was wearing my most professional clothes. I think it threw them off.  No one seemed to really care what I was doing. Lol.  In terms of the color change, I'm not sure. I'm definitely not allergic to anything.  I did put on lotion because I CANNOT be posting pics with ashy hands.  But the change in color happens a lot with makeup, especially palettes. Some brands just look chalky or bland on dark skin (I'm looking at you, Stila and Clinique).     Nars, Mac, MakeupForever, Nyx and Bare Escentuals are my go-tos because I know the color stays true. I can even order them online without worry.  I'm always down to find another great line of makeup, but some brands just don't keep us in mind."
brownbeauty,1d1g5p,Daneelbel_Lee,2,Thu Apr 25 06:14:21 2013 UTC,"Yeah, the color change was mind-boggling to me!   I haven't used any Nars products yet, because they're just SO expensive, but I'm going to soon, especially since I've heard such good things about them. NYX never lets me down, which I love! But, I've also heard GREAT things about Sleek for dark skin! It's just too bad they're not available here in the states."

brownbeauty,1d0paj,Cocotapioka,5,Wed Apr 24 22:03:49 2013 UTC,"I don't know about Naked 2, but I own Naked 1 and I don't think it is too light at all (I have a similar-ish skin tone as you). Someone can feel free to correct me, but I don't think the two are so different that N1 would work drastically better for your skin than N2. I'd swatch it on your own skin to make sure, but I think it would be fine."
brownbeauty,1d0paj,Jnnlopez,2,Wed Apr 24 17:33:00 2013 UTC,Thanks for the clarification! I'll probably go and swatch it for myself and stop taking every cast member's word as gold :)

The only reason I use primer is because it helps keep oil at bay in my T-Zone way better and longer than just a face setting powder. It's only the second primer I've ever tired but I'm really enjoying it. It's Neutrogena's Shine Control Primer. I'd recommend it to other oilys too!

If I don't wear primer, I surely get creases and it's gross. Foiling (method of using water with eyeshadow) makes the pigment stand out a BIT more, depending on the colour, but it does not help me with my oily lids.   But if something has been working for you, don't change it."

brownbeauty,1cwuuh,BabyMcHaggis,3,Thu Apr 25 18:03:41 2013 UTC,"Yeah, most primers seem to just load extra product onto my face unnecessarily, but everyone gushes about them, especially over at /r/makeupaddiction.

(Specifically the blues and the purple tone -ohmygod.)  I honestly think that the vibrant colors would be perfect for darker complexions.  I also agree with the other poster about the lighter shades - they would work as highlights, inner corners, etc.  I really wish I had taken pictures, but alas :(  If you're debating this, I'd seriously recommend it.  $20 is a wonderful price for such buttery, rich shades."

brownbeauty,1cta0d,htesfai,3,Wed Apr 24 05:15:40 2013 UTC,"I think the blogger you linked to has it swatched on medium brown skin, no? She may be on the lighter side of medium, but I think it's a fairly good representation of how it may look on darker skin.   As for the lighter shade, I have this feeling that the lighter nude shades (like the ones lining the bottom) would be immensely flattering as highlights, inner corner shades, and even just light base colors. The color that worries me the most is the author's favorite, #7. It's just too bright and sheen-y to be successful on dark skin, I feel. But, that's just judging it from the swatch. All the other shades are just gorgeous, though, especially  that cool-toned purple, #5.   I might just pick this palette up, actually. It's too bad that it lacks a matte shades, but I guess that's what the pro palette is for."
brownbeauty,1crtap,Daneelbel_Lee,3,Sun Apr 21 00:22:13 2013 UTC,Awesome! Did you use a matte top coat?

brownbeauty,1cnobm,KissThatGrrrl,6,Fri Apr 19 03:41:27 2013 UTC,My best suggestion to you would be to find either a Sephora or a Mac store (or even Macy's anywhere with a good makeup station) and ask them for help. You could even walk through one of those stores and get completely dolled up for free (or you could buy a product if you feel guilty) before your prom (Just shower before you head there and give yourself PLENTY of time just in case)   Also make sure you specify if you have sensitive skin or if you're allergic to something. And talk to the sales person before hand to make sure they're friendly and that they know what they're doing with your complexion. It'll make the whole experience easier overall.
brownbeauty,1cnobm,meqek,2,Fri Apr 19 05:14:42 2013 UTC,"Hey! meqek's suggestion is awesome, but leave enough time that if they mess up horribly, you have time to go home and fix it. I tried the Sears counter for my prom...was not good. But Mac always does a good job.   If you do decide to do it on your own choose one to highlight - your eyes or your lips. If you don't have a lot of experience with your eyes, then a light eyeshadow, and a good swiping of mascara should do, and then do a strong lip. If you want to go all out for your eyes, you can do a stronger eyeshadow, inner and outer eyeliner and even false eyelashes, but then do a really light lip. Remember to use primer so your eye makeup stays on all night, and lip liner so that your lipstick stays on your lips while you eat and drink.    You've got absolutely beautiful clear skin, so don't put too much foundation on...you could even get away with just a tinted moisturizer to even out your skin tone. Then maybe get a highlighter for your cheekbones (as well as your decollatage if you're showing it). A nice deep blush as well.   I don't know what else to tell you since I don't know what makeup you have, but maybe xpost this to /r/MakeupAddiction with a picture of your dress and a picture of all the makeup you have? Also, nothing beats just experimenting - get your dress on, do your hair in a rough approximation of what it'll look like, and try out various things. Remember to start from a clean, moisturized face, and use proper makeup remover to get rid of the makeup.   Hope this helps. Do post up pics from the night, and happy Prom!"
brownbeauty,1cnobm,ftothem,1 point,Fri Apr 19 14:44:09 2013 UTC,"Hi lovely! I agree with all the advice that previous posters have given you.   If you'd like to give it your own go (with drugstore) try out brands like Milani, Covergirl Queen and Black Opal, they generally do a better job of having brown girl foundations without thinking we're all terracotta bricks. (I mean SERIOUSLY)   A makeup counter is great for prom makeup, especially if you want to wear full evening makeup. However, if you'd like to take advantage of your youth (and thus amazing radiance and skin) I'd suggest asking the girls to do a minimal look, with light contouring and highlighting to define your face, instead of going with heavy eye makeup. But girl, if you want that smokey eye, more power to you! Whatever you decide to do, I'm sure will look gorgeous, there's a beautiful canvas to work with!   Good luck and update us!"

If the latter, the only thing I can suggest in contouring, which would make your jaw line appear sharper and more defined, detracting attention from the fold.  If the former, I would imagine that a wrinkle filler might be useful in smoothing the area out-- (collagen and whatnot) which then can be concealed (and I'd use a lighter than skin tone concealer here) and covered with powder."

I've been natural since January of 2010; I just buzzed my hair one day because I was fucking sick of chemicals. My hair is so much healthier, shinier, and fuller.   I haven't used shampoo in about 3 months; I co-wash, then use a hair mayonnaise and/or coconut oil, then fluff, and I'm done.

I'm impressed!! :)  Now, just for continuity, I'd suggest bringing your foundation down to your neck and chest area, and color correct, just as you did on your face!  I have a question- are you super close to the flash in the second picture? Because your foundation looks super light, but it's the same color as your hand, so it might just be a camera thing.   Great job defining your eye shape, I love the liner!  You have lovely eyebrows, and it's shame we can't see the shape so well- have you considered filling them in a bit? I use elf's eyebrow kit in medium and it's more than sufficient for giving me definition! You might try it if you're on a budget, which I totes am.   Lastly, I love the peep of blush that I see (you're a bit washed out in the second picture) and you chose a lovely color for your skin tone. I'd suggest a round of contouring, I think that would really help bring your blush out as well as sculpt your beautiful face a bit more! :)   I'm really glad you updated us on your makeup situation! And I'm digging the color on your lips, do you have a shade?   Thanks for reading girl, I hope I wasn't too obnoxiously overbearing!"
brownbeauty,1cd2ln,chiffonandheels,3,Mon Apr 15 23:25:15 2013 UTC,"Wow! I'm happy that you followed up on me!  I usually do put foundation on my neck area, but I was wearing a turtleneck that day so it wasn't necessary. As for the colour on my face, the flash from the camera exaggerated the lightness of my face, also of my hand. As for my brows, I haven't quite got the hand of filing them as yet. They usually turn out very uneven, super dark, or super light. So I'll just keep trying that out until I get the hang of it.  Contouring is something that I'd love to try out once I find the proper tones and I'll update you guys again once I find it!   As for my lips, it is a mixture of two colours. Revlon, just bitten kissable balm stain. In 030, smitten and black opal , black currant, BQ1.  And last off thanks for following up! I'm glad at least one person here did! Also I hope that colour I gave you works well! ( if you ever use it) :)"

brownbeauty,1bonkl,chiffonandheels,4,Thu Apr 4 20:23:18 2013 UTC,"I love the look! Gorgeous!  I also appreciate that you showed us what the contouring looks like...since I'm a novice and I didn't notice ""bronzer"" in your list, what exactly did you use to contour? Also, when you blended it in...did you use other products to blend it in?"
brownbeauty,1bonkl,iBewafa,2,Fri Apr 5 15:41:32 2013 UTC,"Hi doll! Yes, I didn't use a bronzer because I wanted to keep my face as matte as possible, since the eyeshadows were so shimmery.  I used a lighter than skintone foundation in the center of my face, while using a bit darker than skintone foundation around the outer parts of my face, and a bit on the cheekbone. The actual contouring powder was my milani face powder, which is a nice warm dark brown for me (I found the label! It's Dark Tan 07) and the highlighting powder was a mac studio fix powder that I have in NC30.   I layer the color on with a kabuki brush, and to blend my face, I just used my cheap (but lovely) elf studio powder brush (it's a flat top brush that's crazy soft.) I try to keep the dark ""stripe"" there- that is, I highlight above the stripe and below it, and blend only the barrier between the two tones, and if the contour is too harsh, I'll go over it with a bit of the highlight color.   As for the nose area, the blending process is the same, but the brush is different. I have this lovely blending brush from nyx that I bought back when they made brushes. A mac 217 brush would work, any small fluffy brush is good for blending. The contour on my nose is almost always too harsh, so I often go over it with the nc30 that I have.   I hope this answered your questions! I actually plan on uploading a hyperpigmentation coverup tutorial to brownbeauties soon, and I might throw in a contouring tutorial as well!"

My tips for you:    Go to the dr. get a prescription rash cream, this will be the most crucial if you want to get rid of or just subdue it.  If you don't wanna pay for that, Cortisone works (I heard). It does nothing for me, but I have pretty severe eczema.   Don't itch it.  Find out what makes you break out and avoid it, or use less of it.  For moisturizer, I like Lubriderm for sensitive skin.  But, if you feel like springing a little bit more, I like to use the Clinique face moisturizer. It's in a pump bottle and its yellow.   After showers/baths air dry, and use lotion.    I hope this helps."
brownbeauty,1bfe9k,yellow_mittens,1 point,Mon Apr 1 17:36:04 2013 UTC,Thank you so much for your response! I'm going to get some cortisone to help with the itching and I'm going to look for a good moisturizer. Hopefully it will randomly go away like it randomly appeared!

brownbeauty,1bfe9k,TheIdesOfLight,3,Mon Apr 1 21:25:16 2013 UTC,"I've had this condition since forever and I hate, hate, hate it. As of the moment, I'm breakout free (aside from the tiniest little clusters here and there) by doing a few things. Some of them suck, but they work.   Cool down your showers. Your water needs to be warm at best. Never hot. Heat dries and irritates (that freaking awesome feeling of hot water slamming your back is irritation, unfortunately) leading to breakouts that are worsened and sustained every time you take another hot shower. Drugstore soaps. Throw 'em out! If they're full of hydroxymonkeybutt cinnamon sulfate and FRAYGRANZE, toss 'em. No more Dial body wash, A Body Shop jelly-perfume bath crap, no more CALGON. Toss 'em all, get some really nice bodywash that's very gentle. I recommend Black soap, either in bar or bodywash form. Colloidal oatmeal baths -or- powdered milk/castor oil baths. Do one of these once a week. You won't regret it. Get a non-shitty lotion. I recommend Alaffia's Everyday Shea body lotion. Put this one every night when you hop out of the shower. Put it on while damp, too. Dry or soaking? It'll either sit on top of your skin or evaporate. Eucerin makes a really good body wash, too.  Towels: Ditch them. Or, barely use them. Don't ""carwash"" yourself because friction irritates. Or, get some bamboo towels. I've noticed that when I hop out of the shower and apply my mask or moisturize my face, I've given my body enough air drying time to get the right level of dampness for my lotion. So, I only really use towels for my hair. Apple cider vinegar. This shit is a lifesaver, internally and externally. I noticed my skin improved dramatically after taking two tablespoons of it a day with a little bit of baking soda and in 8-12oz of selzter water. It doesn't taste as bad as you think. Also, swabbing diluted vinegar over your breakouts helps clear them up really quickly. Speaking of Eucerin, go out and buy yourself a tube of the 'Calming Creme'. It really does soothe the burn and also helps knock out the breakouts in half the time. Unlike most, I wouldn't recommend cortizone creams because of the steroids in them. They never really helped me, anyway. This is the case with most people. DON'T SCRATCH. NEVER SCRATCH!! (Sorry, I've been watching Minority Report again) Bonus: Purchase some pure shea butter. Rub it on your dry spots."
brownbeauty,1bfe9k,StopThatDoor,2,Wed Apr 3 18:06:30 2013 UTC,"I have eczema too. And sometimes I get really bad outbreaks on my face/eyes. Mine is usually triggered by stress or extreme shifts in weather (Super cold, super hot). You should see what triggers yours and try to avoid it if you can. Unfortunately, that also means shying away from make up. At least for me. Whenever I have those, I try to have as little on my face as possible, and use maybe a bit of pencil eyeliner.   Usually I'll put on lotion, usually something non-scented. Aveeno is awesome, things with oatmeal in them work best for me I've noticed.   Also as yellow_mittens mentioned, cortisone creams are good. There's a lot of things out there for just eczema now which is really cool, because when I was younger and it was really bad I couldn't find any. Some are kind of expensive though, so I usually stick with Aveeno, Dove, or Cetaphil (or however you spell it).   Drinking a lot of water and tea helps me too, and changing soaps. I have it really bad on my hands right now, so I try avoid washing dishes without gloves on. Even if I'm just washing a fork, I'll put the gloves on.  Good luck! Eczema is a real pain, but you learn to live with it. It wont go away forever, but you can suppress it for a very long time if you're careful."
brownbeauty,1bfe9k,StopThatDoor,1 point,Mon Apr 1 19:02:38 2013 UTC,Thanks for taking the time to respond. I'm going to go buy some cortisone as well as search for a good moisturizer. I think it was triggered by the head and shoulders shampoo that I recently started using so I'm not going to use that anymore. I typically focus on my eyes when it comes to makeup so I should be able to continue to do that. I don't use foundation or cover up so I don't have to worry about not being able to use that anymore.
brownbeauty,1bfe9k,petmamano1,1 point,Mon Apr 1 19:59:01 2013 UTC,That's good! I'm the same way thankfully. It's a lot easier to manage less makeup when I have outbreaks. Just be careful with other make up too. I discovered I'm allergic to a couple of types of lipsticks the hard way.

brownbeauty,1b9rkv,BitterApples,4,Fri Mar 29 22:53:04 2013 UTC,"I'm afraid I can't recommend many specific products, but I think in general you counteract the darker areas by using a color corrector in an orange color (sounds weird I know, but it counteracts the gray color, and makes it look lighter).  Here is a  tutorial which isn't specifically about that (it's a lovely smokey eye tutorial), but around the 8 minute mark she does concealing of darker areas around the model's mouth by mixing an orange color corrector with the other concealer she was using: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=gfXLo__a6Es#!.  I do know that Makeup Forever does concealer/corrector palettes (http://www.sephora.com/5-camouflage-cream-palette-P12630?skuId=873455)  and the one for darker skin has an orange, but I've never used Makeup Forever's concealers so I don't know how they hold up.  Hope that helps, and hope someone else will be able to recommend some more products."
brownbeauty,1b9rkv,Boondockeorla,9,Fri Mar 29 23:37:17 2013 UTC,"I don't know if this will help, although I guess it can't hurt. In Pakistan/India, we use a mixture of turmeric and sandalwood and saffron, called ""Sandal"" to lighten brides' skin before the wedding ceremony (remnants of colonialism? Who knows). Anywho, you can get this mixture at South Asian stores, and then you mix it with milk to get this yellow/orange paste. You put it on your skin for a while, wash off. It definitely brightened my skin tone, and it would probably do the same for you. I've since started using it pretty regularly. I think for anyone substantially lighter than me though, it would just dye their skin yellow.  There's other soothing benefits as well, from the milk and the turmeric (which is known for it's anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties). If you do do this though, wear a shirt that you don't mind getting ruined, since the collar will probably end up yellow.   Hope this helps, and good luck! =)"
brownbeauty,1b9rkv,ftothem,2,Sat Mar 30 02:58:48 2013 UTC,"Wow! I appreciate your theory and I will definitely try this out. I only have one question, how long should I keep this on before I rinse it off?"
brownbeauty,1b9rkv,ftothem,2,Sat Mar 30 15:32:52 2013 UTC,The instructions on my packet say 15-20 mins.
brownbeauty,1b9rkv,HollaDude,1 point,Sun Mar 31 16:49:50 2013 UTC,"I came here to mention turmeric too. Only the way I do it is with yogurt (which has lactic acid and can even skin tone), turmeric, chick pea (or besan) flour, a bit of olive/almond/coconut oil. I mix it into a paste, apply it, leave it on until it dries and rinse it off.   It takes at least a month to see results, but this facemask is magic. Everyone in my family uses it. I recommended it to my friend who had really bad acne once and her skin transformed."
brownbeauty,1b9rkv,DameDrinkware,1 point,Mon Jun 24 23:22:05 2013 UTC,"Is there a place to buy it online, or recipes to make it online? We don't really have any south asian stores where I live that I'm aware of. Also, do you just put it on the dark areas or everywhere?"
brownbeauty,1b9rkv,ftothem,3,Sun Mar 31 00:37:09 2013 UTC,"Hi! I don't know if there is a place to buy it online, search for ""Khas Sandal Ubtan"" which is what mine is called (mine is from Al Noor, a Pakistani company). Also, I found this recipe, but this paste only has sandlewood.  My stuff has lots more ingredients, and you can have more/less ingredients depending on whether you want to make an exfoliating paste or for acne etc.   You can search for other recipes by googling ""sandal"" or ""ubtan"". A lot of the recipes will use Urdu/Hindi words like ""besan"" (chickpea flour), ""atta"" (regular flour), and ""haldi"" (turmeric powder). Let me know if you want me to translate a recipe."
brownbeauty,1b9rkv,ItIsWhatItls,2,Sun Mar 31 16:57:26 2013 UTC,Let me know if you want me to translate a recipe.      That's really sweet of you!
brownbeauty,1b9rkv,HollaDude,1 point,Wed Apr 10 08:49:52 2013 UTC,"I commented in another reply but you can make  a paste of yogurt, turmeric, chickpea/besan flour and some kind of oil (olive, coconut, almond, etc). You can apply it as a facemask and wash it of when it dries (takes about 15 mins).   If you do it every day you should see your skin transform within a month :)"

brownbeauty,1b5b4y,Cocotapioka,1 point,Thu Mar 28 16:37:49 2013 UTC,"Do you like matte shades?  If so, then I'd definitely recommend the Lorac Pro.  I've used Naked 1 in the past, and I really like it - but I feel like the matte selection in the Lorac Pro wins me over.  And I'd say that overall, I think the Lorac Pro leans a little more neutral/cool, whereas the Naked 1 seems pretty warm."
brownbeauty,1b5b4y,Cocotapioka,1 point,Fri Mar 29 01:16:42 2013 UTC,I don't have very many matte shades so I could use some. I am a complete newbie when it comes to warm and cool tones though. I wonder if the Lorac colors would work on me.   Thanks for the input!

If it's blue, you should counteract with something orange but if it's purple, you would need a yellow corrector.  For my skin (I'm a tan Indian), I've found pink works best with my circles. I used ELF's Studio Corrective Concealer and then I top it with Hard Candy's Glamoflauge in Tan. Hope this helps!"
brownbeauty,1asoj8,Espana_Regal,1 point,Sat Mar 23 03:15:28 2013 UTC,Thank you! How do I determine the undertone?

brownbeauty,1ar9hc,floreses,4,Thu Mar 21 21:08:41 2013 UTC,This is something I've learned recently and has been so helpful in getting my lipstick to look right. Thank you!
brownbeauty,1ar9hc,lazybarista,4,Fri Mar 22 03:02:50 2013 UTC,"I used to do this with my concealer and lipgloss to get a nude look, but I've heard that it isn't good to put concealer or foundation on lips because of the toxicity. I've stopped until I get more information, but hopefully I'm worried over nothing because this is a great trick."
brownbeauty,1ar9hc,DameDrinkware,2,Fri Mar 22 06:48:04 2013 UTC,"To be honest though, I always found that applying it straight from the stick gave you better more vibrant color..."
brownbeauty,1ar9hc,helplostaccount,2,Tue Mar 26 01:38:21 2013 UTC,Agreed. The foundation always ends up muddying up the lipstick color.
brownbeauty,1ar9hc,bigpuffyclouds,1 point,Thu Mar 28 20:37:53 2013 UTC,yes.
brownbeauty,1ar9hc,helplostaccount,2,Thu Mar 28 21:57:45 2013 UTC,"Lips come in many shades with some darker than others, regardless of your skin tone. My clients with darker skin tones tend to have darker lips or a dark line on the perimeter of the lip area...But if your lips are naturally pigmented, you‚Äôve probably struggled with lipsticks looking different on you than they do in the tube. If that‚Äôs the case, then this tutorial is for you!  TOOLS:  Your favorite foundation ‚Äî I used MAC Face & Body Foundation on our model Ashley because it‚Äôs a cult classic offering shades for every undertone out there.  Sponge ‚Äî I used the Beauty Blender pink egg-shaped sponge because it‚Äôs the best but you can use any non-latex sponge. Honestly if you haven‚Äôt invested in a Beauty Blender yet, you‚Äôre missing out on the prettiest foundation application ever!  Powder ‚Äî I used Shiseido Pressed Powder but you can use pressed or loose powder that is translucent.  Puff ‚Äî I used a Covergirl Powder Puff but you can also use one that comes with your powder.  Lip liner ‚Äî I used MAC Lip Pencil in Redd (gorgeous on every skin tone).  Lipstick ‚Äî I used Estee Lauder Pure Color Sheer Matte Lipstick but this  technique will make any lipstick wear like its actual true color.  STEPS:   Squeeze a pea-sized amount of foundation into the palm of your hand. Tap the sponge into the foundation to load it up then close your mouth and stipple (tap) the sponge over your entire lip area. Tap the puff into the powder to load it up then tap it all over the lip area as well. Outline and fill in the entire lip area with the lip liner. Go back over it with the lipstick.    Source  Applying foundation before lipstick also helps make the lipstick last longer."

Regular lotion doesn't work for me. I've tried everything! The only things that work for me are Vaseline, olive oil, and coconut oil.  My favourite by far is coconut oil. Vaseline is too heavy; olive oil is great, but reminds me of Italian food; but coconut oil is perfect. I use it for everything: moisturizing my hair and skin, washing my face, cooking, makeup removal. That shit is so versatile, and perfect for us ashier ladies.  For my face, I use extra virgin coconut oil; it's a little pricey (like $12 for 9-12 oz), but worth it for your face. For the rest of my skin and cooking, I use the $4 kind you can find in Walmart. You'll go through it so fast that you won't want to keep shelling out for the expensive stuff (but by all means, if you can afford it, go for it; it's got more of the good stuff your skin loves).  If you don't like the smell of the virgin stuff, go for the cheap kind; it has no smell. When I put this on my skin I scent it with perfume oils. No constant reapplying of perfume for me!"
brownbeauty,1amm61,Daneelbel_Lee,2,Wed Mar 20 01:17:23 2013 UTC,"In the next couple weeks, I'm gonna buy this Coconut Oil from Vitacost, it's a good deal, and if you spend $25 in Vitacost brand stuff you get free shipping.

brownbeauty,1abfro,femmepastiche,9,Thu Mar 14 23:41:03 2013 UTC,"I've never liked the makeup that makeup artists have put on me. Not ever.   The foundation shade is always off- in an ashy way. They always try to put me in shades of purple, as if that's the only color WOC can wear. And they always put me in the glossiest of glossy lipgloss (with a purple tint of course), which just isn't the most flattering look on me. It makes my lips look bigger but not in a great way. Matte and satin finishes lipsticks look a million times better and my lips still look full.   Ashy foundation, purple, and gloss have been what they've tried every. single. time. It's so predictable at this point.   They also usually act like they're excited about getting to do things on my face (I guess I have pretty good skin but seriously there's nothing really different about it so I don't get why they act like it's so well, different) but I quickly learn that they don't know how to select the right foundation, think outside the box for types of looks, and what to do with full lips."
brownbeauty,1abfro,tooptoop,6,Fri Mar 15 03:22:19 2013 UTC,"That's good to know, thanks! Would ashy-ness just stem from not choosing a dark enough foundation, or choosing something that's not the right undertone (or both)?   I feel like purple is so overdone/weirdly dramatic and not appropriate for most occasions on WOC. Regardless, I usually like to talk with clients before I do anything to get a feel of what they do and don't like, and maybe specific things they know do not work for them. Again, thanks so much! Everything you said was very helpful."
brownbeauty,1abfro,tooptoop,4,Fri Mar 15 03:31:49 2013 UTC,I think the ashiness stems from foundation that is too light and or not the right undertone.
brownbeauty,1abfro,Daneelbel_Lee,2,Fri Mar 15 03:59:47 2013 UTC,"That's what I figured, thank you. I've spent a lot of time learning about undertones and color matching on specific skin types, so hopefully I can avoid that!"
brownbeauty,1abfro,brrrrrrrrr,3,Fri Mar 15 05:28:21 2013 UTC,"Both. I've had artists give me colours that looked okay in the shitty retail lighting, but when I walked out the door you could see clear lines of where the cool foundation ended, and my golden-red skin tone began. Yuck."
brownbeauty,1abfro,Daneelbel_Lee,3,Fri Mar 15 04:03:05 2013 UTC,shades of purple   I've noticed this! Why are things targeted at us so purple? Not that I have a problem with purple its a great color but I've noticed this pattern and am curious.
brownbeauty,1abfro,GobiasFrozenBananas,9,Mon Mar 18 07:59:16 2013 UTC,"As a Latina, I think one of the problems is assuming that since we are tan/bronze we are all ""warm"" tones. This sometimes ends up with my makeup being too orange-y or pink. I think it's important to not assume a shade and actually try to match the foundation, regardless of ""cool"" or ""warm"". OP just remember to not generalize skin tones:)"
brownbeauty,1abfro,amurow,2,Fri Mar 15 08:08:07 2013 UTC,That's really good to know. Sometimes I have a tendency to assume that as well - I need to stop myself. Thank you!
brownbeauty,1abfro,amurow,8,Fri Mar 15 23:24:15 2013 UTC,"I second everything tooptoop said, and I'd like to add:  I can tell someone has never worked on darker skin tones before. Know how? When they only recommend safe options like mascara, liner, and highlighter. For me at least, I wouldn't mind an artist who tried out different stuff on me until we both felt it looked good. Try a different blush, not everyone looks good in apple red! Try a different pink, magenta or nude lipstick; just because your last dark client liked bubble gum pink doesn't mean I will!   And for the love of makeup, suggest other products! I will come back for you to do my makeup again and again if you can suggest a good, atypical product, like bronzer for dark skin, a good setting powder that won't make me look ashy, a colour-correcting concealer, or a nice contouring product."
brownbeauty,1abfro,KelsayLilay,3,Fri Mar 15 04:00:46 2013 UTC,"That's good advice, thank you. I can see where SAs would want to be conservative because they might not be as confident working on women with different skin tones. That's unfortunate that they fall into ruts too. I'm trying to avoid that, definitely! Learning about all brand and what they offer to different skin tones and types really help - but it is a lot to memorize. I'll keep all of that in mind :D"
brownbeauty,1abfro,ceepolk,6,Fri Mar 15 05:21:48 2013 UTC,"Whenever I go to makeup artists, they proclaim that my skin is tan. Then they slather an orange foundation on my skin.   I'm not sure where the problem arises from. Yes, I am tan, but that is just a name for my natural skin tone. You can call it ""latte"" or ""chai"" or ""peanut butter"" or anything other than ""tan"" if it helps you stay away from orange.   I do have warm undertones, so maybe it's a problem with the foundation shades that they have on-hand. I love the feel of Bare Minerals, but their ""golden tan"" is way too dark and orange for me, and the ""tan"" is a bit light if it's not blended properly. Revlon ColorStay in Natural Tan 330 matches my skin tone pretty well. Bobbi Brown has some great colors too, but the smell is too much for me.  Another issue I have is with finishing powders that leave an ashy or way too white finish on my face.  I've noticed that black eyeliner emphasizes my hereditary under-eye circles. I think a rich dark brown or a shade like eggplant looks nicer with my skin tone.  Have you seen the WOC makeup tumblr? Maybe you can get some ideas from it.  I hope this helps! Good luck with your makeup artist journey!"
brownbeauty,1abfro,jingabobo,2,Fri Mar 15 04:15:44 2013 UTC,"This really helps, thank you. There are reasons why I would and would not like to work at a counter - limited product selection being one of the reason's why I wouldn't. I'm sorry you've had such a hard time with SAs matching the wrong colors. I am trying to build my kit with as much color variation as possible, but it can get tricky. With regards to matching skin tones and ashy-ness, I'm about to drop some $$ on setting powders from Ben Nye in different undertones for deeper skin tones.   That tumblr link is wonderful, thank you!!"

brownbeauty,1abbdn,Jnnlopez,2,Sat Mar 16 07:01:45 2013 UTC,I'm still weirdly on the fence about ordering foundations samples again. I based my choices of not only what looked closest to my current foundation but what they recommended. Turns out I bought 11 samples that were all wrong my my skin tone and undertones. I contacted them about it and they pointed me to one that doesn't look like it would fit me but the next time I order I'll keep that in mind (especially since I want to try many of those blushes).  My go to for foundation is CoverFX since I can try it in Sephora and not have reservations about purchasing it. I've become a bit hesitant about purchasing foundations unless I can try it beforehand or else I suffer having to spend a bunch of money so that I can essentially toss it away.  Edit: Syntax. I should have elaborated at the end.

Also, you can buy smaller sample sizes of different shades from the Missha website to see which one would match your complexion best before you invest in a larger/ more expensive bottle! There are also a lot of videos available of people with darker complexions reviewing Missha #31, so you could see if you think it would work for you!  Etude House also has a range of shades, I just ordered one from them, but haven't tried it out yet, but I heard it's supposed to be good and more moisturizing."

brownbeauty,1a9gf0,Daneelbel_Lee,2,Thu Mar 14 03:36:24 2013 UTC,Thanks for posting this! I can't wait to watch these later!
brownbeauty,1a9gf0,JurassicPFan,3,Thu Mar 14 13:21:29 2013 UTC,"lizlizlive beautyqq destinygodley   These three are amazinggg. Beautyqq is more of a lifestyle guru, but I love her videos because they're so soothing. The other two are straight-up makeup and they are gorgeous too. Definitely check them out ^"
brownbeauty,1a9gf0,KelsayLilay,2,Fri Mar 15 09:32:19 2013 UTC,"I watch a ton of gurus, but my favorite WOC are definitely Makeup By Leina Baby and Miss L Bailey. I find that a lot of asian gurus also have great tutorials that match my face shape/dimensions and eyes."

brownbeauty,1a9f0a,Daneelbel_Lee,2,Thu Mar 14 02:54:38 2013 UTC,"*L'Oreal Paris Magic BB Cream in Deep: This was the first BB cream I bought back in August. I first I liked it, the texture is a little grainy. However it IS sparkly. Like if you are caught in the light, your skin starts to shimmer and I don't really like it. I pulled it out a few weeks ago to try again and it looked like I had a white mask on! I don't know if it oxidized or what, but I was very disappointed.  *Smashbox Camera Ready BB Cream in Dark- I LOVE this stuff. I got a sample of it from Sephora and I just absolutely adore it. It goes on really smoothly and is quite moisturizing. Coverage is pretty decent, it didn't completely cover some hyperpigmentation on my cheek but it did a good job of making my skin look even and glowy. However, it is VERY VERY expensive. If you're cheap (like me) I suggest going to Sephora and asking for a couple sample from one of the generous looking store clerks. That should last you until you can save up the dough."
brownbeauty,1a9f0a,tropfou,1 point,Fri Mar 15 02:50:59 2013 UTC,"Niiiice. I really, really want to try the Smashbox out before I make a purchase like that (holy dough!), but I'm also really afraid of looking like a cheap skate asking for a sample. I've never done it.   I think I'm missing out."
brownbeauty,1a9f0a,DameDrinkware,2,Fri Mar 15 02:55:58 2013 UTC,"Love it Foundation Reviews  Givenchy Photo'Perfexion Fluid in Perfect Honey: My perfect foundation. It matches my skin, it has great coverage, a great finish and I can wear it all day. My only gripes are the size vs price and the spelling of Photo'Perfexion, which is stupid.  Tarte BB cream in Medium: I love how velvety smooth this is! It has fantastic light coverage that magically covers my blemishes but leaves my freckles intact. Plus it has SPF, so I can finally bribe myself into putting on sunscreen.  Meh Foundation Review  Nars sheer glow in Barcelona: I loved that this foundation matched my skin, and the finish was lovely. However after a few hours of wear it balled up on my skin, making it look hella flaky. I wore it for months and this was consistently the result, regardless of application.  Negative Foundation Reviews  Hourglass Veil Fluid Makeup Foundation in Sand: Probably my most expensive disappointment from Sephora. The color, what little there was, matched me. However, this foundation actually accentuated my blemishes. There are probably 100 foundations better than this one on the market, and for prices 10-50% less.  Fresh Umbrian Clay Foundation: This foundation is of the devil. I very rarely get so much as a bump on my face, but this foundation is essentially a breakout in a bottle. I found it to be incredibly oily and it looked like wet paint on my skin until I took it off."

brownbeauty,1a9ffp,Daneelbel_Lee,2,Thu Mar 14 03:11:18 2013 UTC,I found a link with instructions though I don't know if they're accurate (I don't mod any subs).
brownbeauty,1a9ffp,niccig,3,Thu Mar 14 20:35:45 2013 UTC,I don't think anyone would ever say 'no' to flair :p
brownbeauty,1a9ffp,avocadomuffin,2,Thu Mar 14 05:13:27 2013 UTC,Grr I wish I knew what my skin tone in Mac was. I have only used Chanel foundation and I am always going between beige 40 and 50.
brownbeauty,1a9ffp,anne_sophie,12,Thu Mar 14 03:15:46 2013 UTC,Have you tried using findation.com?  I feel like I'm always using this website to look at my other foundation options.  It's been pretty accurate for me so far!
brownbeauty,1a9ffp,chellachellabobella,3,Thu Mar 14 03:23:19 2013 UTC,What an awesome site! Thanks for sharing!
brownbeauty,1a9ffp,anne_sophie,2,Thu Mar 14 03:32:31 2013 UTC,Haha right after I commented I went straight there! It seems in Mac I am a between an NC30 to an NC40. My best guess after seeing the recs and some googling I am more than likely an NC35.
brownbeauty,1a9ffp,sefie,1 point,Thu Mar 14 03:35:46 2013 UTC,"I use 40 in Chanel Perfection Lumiere, and NC42 in MAC Studio Fix.  I do think the MAC is a little dark for me nowadays, though."
brownbeauty,1a9gie,Daneelbel_Lee,1 point,Thu Mar 14 03:15:05 2013 UTC,"Here's one with flash if that helps.  Unfortunately I don't have colour names as these came in a huuuuuge limited edition Sephora palette, but I'll describe them as best I can.  The first is a shimmery turquoise. I think this colour looks wonderful on my skin.  The second is a very deep navy blue. Gorgeous, but when on the lids, the colour can be mistaken for black or gray unless you use a primer.  The third is a shimmery magenta.  I like this a lot, but again, primer if you want it to show as the actual colour instead of a muted pink.  The fourth is a matte violet. Very pretty and deep.  The fifth is a matte purple. Tends to show lighter than it looks.  Sixth is a light glittery lilac. Careful! It can look ashy without primer.  Seventh is a slightly glittery orange-red. Not a fan.  Eighth is a straight up, matte orange. It looks gross with my undertones.  I can't wait to swatch this whole palette! I just don't have enough skin to do it in one sitting, lol."
brownbeauty,1a9gie,avocadomuffin,3,Thu Mar 14 03:26:19 2013 UTC,That fourth colour... :O I neeeed it!  (And that turquoise really does look amazing on your skin!)

brownbeauty,1cjzwv,greengirl2,2,Wed Apr 17 20:03:55 2013 UTC,"Lord, if you can find something I'd be ever so grateful. I sweat like a beast.  That said, a product won't make you sweat; you want a product that will help you control it.   Besides powder and lots of it, I don't know of anything else.  :-("
brownbeauty,1cjzwv,Daneelbel_Lee,1 point,Wed Apr 17 21:53:29 2013 UTC,I've got the same issue. I've found that if I apply a thin layer of any kind of Ponds cold cream I don't sweat at all.
brownbeauty,1cjzwv,lazybarista,1 point,Wed Apr 17 20:08:46 2013 UTC,Really? Ponds never thought of that. Does it feel heavy or light on your face? Because i am seeing that they are mostly for dry skin..
brownbeauty,1cjzwv,chiffonandheels,1 point,Wed Apr 17 20:18:58 2013 UTC,I forgot to mention that I have really dry patches of skin on my face that I moisturize daily.

brownbeauty,1dfa08,Cherryroses,9,Tue Apr 30 17:50:22 2013 UTC,"What is different between the above two pics?  Please post a link to your prior post, or label the photos clearly.  You could be very pretty... But I can't get past the makeup.   Lose the star, look up some eyeliner tutorials.  Try doing the waterline instead of above your lashes, if you are having a hard time redrawing it thinner/neater.  The lipstick would be sort of cool for Halloween or a goth look, but combined with the rest it is just bad.  My first response to your current look, seriously, was wtf.  Sorry, but you need to know.  Not a good look for you.  At all."
