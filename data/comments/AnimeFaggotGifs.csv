The guy basically finds out he has the ability to possess people for 5 seconds and uses it to look up girls skirts, score top score at every exam and enter the best highschool without studying and also to get the most desired girl in school.  It's like if Lelouch was actually a huge faggot with no ambition."
AnimeFaggotGifs,3c7w8m,Commander_Ninja,2,Mon Jul 6 03:01:01 2015 UTC,Actually the concept of the show is that there's a group of people who are trying to stop that kind of creepy anime bullshit from happening. There's only one episode out at the moment but it seemed interesting enough.
AnimeFaggotGifs,3c7w8m,Luigiman217,0,Mon Jul 6 00:00:46 2015 UTC,I'll give it a watch. The last anime I legit enjoyed was Gurren Lagann. I wasn't much for Attack on Titan. Just seemed like a competent version of naruto but with slightly less ninja stuff.
AnimeFaggotGifs,3c7w8m,jamsterbuggy,2,Mon Jul 6 02:13:24 2015 UTC,If you haven't seen kill la kill I definetely recommend it as a supplement to a fun show like gurren lagann. Most of the guys who made that show went on to become part of trigger which made kill la kill. So the same fun times are had.

AnimeFaggotGifs,37swpn,Cantnoscope,4,Sat May 30 07:14:27 2015 UTC,Why thank you!
AnimeFaggotGifs,37swpn,Cantnoscope,3,Sun May 31 06:27:27 2015 UTC,Sweet mother of fan-service.  EDIT: Just noticed that you made all of the recent Nichijou gifs. That show is a gold mine for this sub.
AnimeFaggotGifs,37swpn,Cantnoscope,2,Sun May 31 06:34:55 2015 UTC,"It really is. So many out of place scenes that they work perfectly. Also the above picture is from the visual novel, so it makes a bit more sense."
AnimeFaggotGifs,37swpn,EmEmAttack,3,Sun May 31 06:42:56 2015 UTC,"Probably read that wrong, but what is that from again?"
AnimeFaggotGifs,37swpn,n0oo7,3,Sun May 31 06:45:05 2015 UTC,"Grisaia no Kajitsu. My personal favorite visual novel. There was an anime adapted from it but the VN was much better. The gif I originally made is from the anime, but the photo in my comment is from the VN."

AnimeFaggotGifs,36hyjz,Birgerz,7,Tue May 19 19:13:46 2015 UTC,I feel like it sets the mood for what you can expect to see on this sub.
AnimeFaggotGifs,36hyjz,Quidfacis_,4,Tue May 19 19:19:14 2015 UTC,I guess low effort fits right in :P
