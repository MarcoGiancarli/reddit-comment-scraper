But in order to use the special ECC ram you need to have a CPU that also supports ECC and a motherboard with a chipset that supports ECC as well.  ECC memory is memory that has an extra chip on it that stores parity data for all the rest of the data on the RAM chip.  Parity data can be used to detect and repair corrupt data.  So for ECC ram whenever data is read from it, it will check to see if the data is corrupt.  If it is corrupt and it is only a single bit corruption it will automatically correct the error.  If the corruption is worse the RAM will tell the system and the system will halt.  ECC RAM is simply more reliable than standard RAM.  It will result in a more stable machine and a machine that is less prone to random data corruption which is important for servers that need to not crash and file servers that store lots of important data."

If you have bad RAM, it might see that the data read into memory doesn't agree with the parity data, and ""correct"" that data on disk, which would corrupt it.

""...thus _reducing the window of vulnerability from a memory error."". He does not say eliminate or any guarantee that ZFS is error proof from this.  Also, he says ""if you love your data, use ECC RAM""  I have seen a few posts similar to the one you cite before, and unfortunately I was unable to find them again when I wanted to review them, so I wasn't able to (in)validate them as reliable sources. However this post is a good one.  It's also worth noting there is quite a bit of counter information, not just from Cyberjock ( ;) ), recommending the use of ECC.  It's also worth noting that DDR3 ECC is very affordable compared to non-ECC now adays."
homelab,3e29ad,Savagedlight,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:17:56 2015 UTC,"The original statement  was whether you need ECC when you use ZFS. The answer to this is no, as it's not inherently bad to use ZFS on non-ECC systems. For the reasons stated in the aforementioned post.  You're moving the goal post here though, and saying you can't guarantee data integrity without ECC. This is true. This is also true for other file systems.  You're still better off with ZFS on non-ECC RAM than you are on non-ZFS with non-ECC RAM. You're even better off if you have ECC RAM, though.  Do note that ECC RAM does not guarantee bit flips won't affect your data. It usually just reduces the chance significantly, by guaranteeing an odd-numbered amount of bit flips won't affect your data.

ECC is actually necessary for ZFS, don't fool yourself."
homelab,3e29ad,BloodyIron,-1,Tue Jul 21 20:40:57 2015 UTC,"When ZFS does checksumming on the data (which it does constantly) it needs to be confident the information in memory hasn't bit flipped.

The E3 has a TDP of 35w versus the 65w of the i7, same cache, same cores, same memory bandwidth and max memory, lower clock speed (To match the reduced TDP) but as it is a Xeon it will have passed a higher QA standard and come with a slightly inflated price tag. The Xeon also has support for TET (Trusted Execution Technology) which the i7 does not. If that acronym is meaningless to you, then you probably don't have to worry about that.  2.) The E5, which is a generation back and only 22nm rather than 14nm, has a much higher TDP, same clock speed, same core, higher last-level cache (by a fair amount actually) has a max memory size of 768GB, QUAD (4x) channel memory, over doubled memory bandwidth, and has 40 maximum PCIe lanes as opposed to 16 on the i7, for an incredibly similar tray price point.  Now, that being said, I did not pick the ""Ultra high-end i7"" because I picked this price point for a reason. Specifically, these are among the lowest tray cost of their generation and are of the newest generation of their type. Yes, the new 5960x for $1000 tray can indeed get quite impressive with it's stat sheet, but for $1000 and the willingness to double one's TDP, you could get two of the E5's I linked above and have a fairly impressive server.  Of course, we should be seeing the E5v4s soon in the 14nm architecture as well, and that should see some price modulations for both the v3 as well as the newer v4 series Xeons.  TL;DR: Don't discount features like cache, TDP, and memory channels when making processor comparisons. Pricing for Xeon and Core i5/i7 series processors follows different patterns and different price-points will have access to different features."

Won't be a problem as long as you don't have two machines pegging the I/O.  *If the network is too much of a bottleneck and you have a switch that supports LACP then it's a good idea to bond a couple of NICs together on your target.

This is my current network, but I don't have a diagram of my subnets and stuff on there at the moment. https://imgur.com/a/ni3Sc  One thing you want to consider with your ""home theater"" network, is if you will be able to control it from a different subnet. My HDHomerun has to be on the same subnet as what ever I want to watch on, but my Amazon Fire Tv can be controlled from a different subnet. Also, it doesn't matter if the devices support VLANs or not, you can tell the switch which ports to tag.  The main goal of subnetting is to split up broadcast networks and for security to control traffic between networks. You can always start smaller with 2 subnets and then expand out from there. What router are you using?"
homelab,3e3qsx,matthaios637,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:13:30 2015 UTC,"Haha yea it is!  I like your network, thanks for the link.  Hmm, that's something I haven't thought of. However, the devices usually just get controlled by their remotes. The only devices that would be connected to that are the Apple TV and an onD Pro Android set top box, both manually controlled by their remotes. However, we are planning to switch to all android cellular devices, so this might be something to keep in mind. Thanks. As per the VLANs, the switch is able to untag the port, so that the port is on a vlan, but the packets don't have vlan headers, which should work.  Yes, I could start smaller, and probably should, but I'm not sure of a sane way to split them, unless I just go 'All' and 'Guest' for now.  I am currently running Sophos UTM, virtualized on Proxmox, however, that can be switched to pfSense, and I guess I could go back to ESXI... however I was hoping to stay with Proxmox (even though the networking is more complicated)."

I set up an IPSEC tunnel between my VPS servers (using Openswan -- I find it easier to work with than OpenVPN but YMMV) and the pfSense VM in my homelab. On the VPS side I run nginx & Varnish, using nginx configured with a cheap wildcard SSL certificate as an SSL terminator, and proxy the request over the tunnel to the destination server based on the hostname (eg a.domain.com -> a.internal.server, b.domain.com -> b.internal.server) using Varnish. It works pretty well."

homelab,3e2emb,tjtoml,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:28:07 2015 UTC,If it's for 'work' and you're not freelance or what not. Get them to run the servers at their expense.  If it's just you/handfull of people you know using/testing these apps. Just setup a VPN at home and give them the keys to access those apps. (Firewall things so they can't access your personal machines). If VPN is too complex you can use SSH port forwarding as a poormans VPN to access the VMs inside of your network.  Which ISP are you with? Guessing Virgin Media? (UK and those speeds) I reckon you'll be fine running a few low traffic sites.  Although you don't have a static IP at home you can use dynamic dns to keep a domain pointed at the VMs.
homelab,3e2emb,64mb,3,Tue Jul 21 13:55:49 2015 UTC,Yep Virgin Media.  I work freelance and clients already moan no end about the production server costs never mind additional costs. Some even host their production sites in house (shudder) to keep costs down.  I'd rather not get clients connecting to the VPN as they struggle with logging into an admin control panel most of the time haha.
homelab,3e2emb,tjuk,3,Tue Jul 21 14:11:23 2015 UTC,"A massive word of warning when it comes to Virgin Media and doing this :)   Virgin have a fairly aggressive ""on peak"" traffic management system in place that they don't exactly advertise for their ""unlimited"" products  I assume it is designed to hit P2P traffic but it is a killer for hosting your own web-apps.  They are awesome for most consumers as they do not limit download speeds but will cap your upload speed by 50/65% (down to 4mbs up) if you exceed 2GB uploaded in an hour, 3GB in two hours between 4pm-11pm weekdays, 11am-11pm at the weekends.  I do web design/dev work and host all my stuff on my home-office server. Run ESXi and have a few VMs running.   They tend to be rock solid for low level traffic but I couldn't figure why everything would grind to a halt if a client downloaded a big archive file/backup etc.  I was also merrily backing all my data offsite over the weekend and hitting the cap consistently.    If you are going to be doing big syncs of VMs/snapshots etc between home/office you are going to suddenly see the home>office speed slow right down."

However I grew tired of that setup since I don't need that much power (its only running a few informational pages, ttrss, owncloud, znc and paperwork) so I went back to a cheap VPS.  But yeah, generally that's a rather simple setup. You might want to check your provider's details in your contract about hosting webpages/etc at home.  Edit: For VM's - its possible, but I haven't done that yet. I bet there is a load of documentation for that. However if you want multiple https sites on one IP you're out of luck - that iss only possible with HTTP 1.1."
homelab,3e2emb,tiernanotoole,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:01:21 2015 UTC,"up until reciently, i was doing exactly the same. I will probably be moving back to this sooner, rather than later also. I have 3 WAN links in the house, a few VMs running on Hyper-V and these vms run web servers.   I have an upstream box (OVH in France, paying something like a fiver a month for a dual atom box) which runs Varnish and HAProxy. HAProxy points at the IPs of the WAN connections at home, port 80. then Varnish points at it.   Varnish caches anything it can, and HAProxy does upstream to the boxes in house. Since there are multiple boxes in house, NGinX sits in front and picks a backend.  It also allows a WAN link to fall over and the sites stay up. Depending on how cachable your content is, some sites dont hit the backend for hours.   One note: Check your TOS. If there is no mention of running servers in house, you might be good to just run in house. DynDNS for DNS (or AWS Route53 will work also).   Final note: Maybe hide behind Cloudflare or somewhere like that. They will do the caching, are cheaper than a VPS (Free) and have their CDN running in more places... I used them for a while, and may move back soon too..."

homelab,3e3scq,houmoller,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:03:52 2015 UTC,"In theory, if you have a server with multiple GPUs, (preferably AMD) then this is possible. You would need something like a hypervisor (esxi comes to mind) and then pass the GPUs to two windows VMs. You would also need two USB controllers, one for each VM, that would also get passed through to the VMs. This would allow you to plug HDMI cables in for video and USB cables for controls. Additionally, you can probably find HDMI over Ethernet adapters and USB extensions for having it in another room.   See this https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/17j4we/more_deathstar_than_battlestation/?ref=share&ref_source=link for an idea of what you can do (although I think multiple computers are used for the desktops)."

Then used a Raspberry Pi as a thin client to remote in to it. It worked, but video is what suffered the most. For web surfing and basic productivity, this worked well, but I wanted to be able to stream 720-1080p video as well, which this setup could not do. I've read up on some people being able to get 30 fps at 1080p with similar setups.  If you kept the server in the same room, you can run multiple video cards and have them bypass to specific VM hosts, which should work fine for gaming. To get them out in to another room is where things get tougher. You will have to look up more info on HDMI and USB over ethernet."
homelab,3e3i4m,superkevx,2,Tue Jul 21 17:54:54 2015 UTC,I will answer the best I can but my experience is more with esxi.   Yes you can use the core install for your hyper-v host. If you want to you can do a full install and then remove the GUI later on. I believe this is possible but I think you will need to add a video card and configure passthrough. I am not really sure what you mean by manage our shared files. Manage access to the files? Should be doable Once again doable but you might want to add another drive and setup RAID for redundancy.   Hopefully this is helpful. I would recommend going for a larger SSD (like 250GB) and putting all of the VMs on it. Use the spinning disks for storage.  I would definitely add more RAM. In esxi I normally start with 4GB per Windows server instance.  Edit: Formatting

As the other guy said, you'll need a motherboard and cpu that supports ddr3, but that's only half of it. You'll need a mobo/cpu that supports registered ECC, at those frequencies, and also supports 8gb modules. The only boards that are guaranteed to work are specific IBM servers, which I'll bet are still in production, and cost thousands of dollars.   They might be throwing this out because it's dead. In which case, investing many hundreds, or even thousands of dollars into a server board and cpu capable of accepting that ram, just to test if it works or not, is probably not worth it.

For example the NUC5i5RYH is 360$ http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16856102097, but I can get this laptop http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834314822 for 340$ and it's CPU is actually a tiny bit better (higher base clock speed and lower TDP-down) and I get 4GB of RAM and 500GB HDD for free. Plus it of course comes with an attached keyboard/monitor (although shitty resolution). Though it has a much bigger footprint, but still being a laptop you can just stick it on top of something pretty easily and with the monitor off it shouldn't have much if any power difference.

homelab,3dzhwv,dokumentamarble,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:13:54 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply.  I am currently able to communicate between VLANS and those firewall rules are confgured in PFSENSE.  It is only the management interface of the TP-Link switch which is the exception to the rule.  I am unable to reach the gui or ping the switch unless I am physically connected to the switch on VLAN20.

homelab,3dzhwv,just_insane,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:20:27 2015 UTC,"That would be my presumption as well, but the question still remains of how to access it?  Is it formal practice to put a PC or laptop in the management VLAN or maybe create an SSID in that vlan for management purposes?"
homelab,3dzhwv,just_insane,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:23:31 2015 UTC,"Isn't it port based VLAN's? If so couldn't you put 10 and 20 on the same port for 1 PC to access both VLANs?  Sorry if I'm totally wrong about this, I'm just getting my first smart switch later this week."
homelab,3dzhwv,somuchmoresnow,2,Mon Jul 20 20:35:01 2015 UTC,"Yea, you can only put an access port in one VLAN."
homelab,3dzhwv,ThePegasi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:17:13 2015 UTC,Hmm. No idea then. Sorry
homelab,3dzhwv,ThePegasi,2,Mon Jul 20 21:20:38 2015 UTC,"PFSense uses firewall rules to control inter-VLAN routing.  Just create floating rules for any traffic you want to allow, then make floating rules blocking everything else below the ""allow"" rules.  That way you'll get the network isolation you're trying to get with the VLANs, and can control (and monitor) any inter-VLAN traffic so that you can reach only port 443 (https) on the switch from your VLAN10 and no other resources.  Make sure to check the ""Apply rule immediately"" box on those floating rules.  There are some cases when this will not work as expected, where a device blocks any IP outside of its local net.  So if the switch is at 192.168.0.2/24, you will not be able to access it from 192.168.2.10.  In those cases you can try ssh port forwarding through your PFSense box or a raspi/other jump-box on your management VLAN.  I have one particular cheap switch that has non-configurable access controls, and I need to use SSH port forwarding through a tftp-server/jump-host on my management VLAN in order to configure things."
homelab,3dzhwv,ThePegasi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:21:46 2015 UTC,"This is a quirk of these TP-Link switches, they will only let you access the management interface if you're on the same subnet/VLAN.  The easiest way to get around this would be to use pfsense to NAT any traffic from non management VLANs to the management IP of the switch, though you probably only need to do it for traffic from VLAN 10 since I assume the devices you want to manage the switch from all sit on this VLAN. This will masquerade such traffic with the gateway IP of the pfsense router on the management VLAN, meaning the switch will accept the traffic. I did precisely this to manage my SG3210 in a similar setup, though I was using an Edgerouter Lite instead of pfsense."
homelab,3dzhwv,ThePegasi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:06:40 2015 UTC,Awesome that confirms what my assumption was. I guess I have to figure out how to set up the NAT between the VLANs. Yet another project. Thanks for clearing this up for me.

homelab,3dzhwv,Samatic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:04:09 2015 UTC,"Nice. I've never used pfsense, is it relatively simple to do NAT rules like that?"
homelab,3dzhwv,Casper042,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:07:44 2015 UTC,It was.  I just copied the default LAN to WAN rule and replaced WAN with VLAN20 and the LAN subnet with the VLAN10 subnet. Not sure if that was the correct way to do it but it took about 30 seconds and worked perfectly.
homelab,3dzhwv,Casper042,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:14:49 2015 UTC,"That should work fine. One thing worth noting is that this will NAT all traffic from the VLAN10 to VLAN20, which may not be desirable if you have other devices on VLAN20 that you'd rather simply route to, not NAT to. If possible, it might be worth trying to change that rule so that the destination is set as the IP address of the switch rather than the whole of VLAN20, meaning only traffic sent from VLAN10 to the switch will be NAT'd.  On my ERL, it was something like: masuerade on eth 1.1 (as eth1 was the port I used to trunk to my switch for the whole LAN, and VLAN 1 was my management VLAN, so the full interface name is eth1.1) with destination 192.168.100.2 (switch's IP) and source as eth1.10 (my main device VLAN, where the traffic is coming from). Not sure how this will look on pfsense, but it should be roughly similar."
homelab,3dzhwv,Casper042,2,Tue Jul 21 15:08:33 2015 UTC,"I will look in to that, I'm not sure if its possible in pfsense.  There doesn't seem to be a choice for the destination to be a specific address, only ""any"" or ""network"".  Can you think of a scenario where it would be adverse for the communication to be NATed?

homelab,3e0gqn,h3rrmiller,2,Tue Jul 21 02:12:11 2015 UTC,I'm talking about disabling dhcp on the router completely.   Assign the LAN interface an IP. Disable all dhcp functionality on the wireless router. Plug the rest of your network into the LAN port.   This setup will have your wireless router doing only wireless authentication (in other words acting as a dumb AP) to your network. Once a wireless device is authenticated to the network it will request a dhcp lease. At this point the dhcp broadcasts will be broadcasted across the whole LAN segment and received/replied to by the real dhcp server thus providing your wireless device an IP and DNS information.   Google 'openwrt dumb ap'
homelab,3e0gqn,h3rrmiller,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:23:32 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about disabling dhcp on the router completely.    That is what ""DHCP forwarding"" does, in this case. It forwards DHCP requests to the identified IP address. For me, that address is 192.168.1.254, or my pfSense IP.   Assign the LAN interface an IP.    I already did that. The ""WAN"" port on the AP is one of the switch ports. the actual WAN port is empty.   Disable all dhcp functionality on the wireless router   I can't do that. There is a drop down menu with 2 choices: DHCP forwarder or DHCP server. it is currently DHCP forwarder and the ""DHCP Server"" section lists the pfSense address.   Plug the rest of your network into the LAN port   My hardwired devices use a dumb gigabit switch. The oly things plugged into this ""AP"" is my raspberry Pi that rarely gets used and my ObiHai that also doesn't get used (so things that don't have a use for gigabit). This really is already just an AP. it worked fine before I fucked around with pfSense..... the only reason i did is because I had to get VMWare tools installed and to do that, I had to spin up a new VM. My whole set up previously existed on VMware workstation and I only recently transtioned to ESXi. However, it has worked on ESXi until now.   This setup will have your wireless router doing only wireless authentication (in other words acting as a dumb AP) to your network.   It's ""technically"" already set up that way.

homelab,3e0gqn,r0lav,2,Tue Jul 21 02:44:59 2015 UTC,I think I misunderstood your issue.   I think your issue might be reverse DNS. For log purposes a lot of Linux services like to reverse map IP addresses to FQDN.   This causes issues if your Linux server is trying to ask 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS) what the FQDN of 192.168.1.100 or other private address.  Double check the DNS settings on your Linux server and ensure you are using your internal DNS server.   Also be sure you have a search line in your/etc/resolv.conf: search domain.com  This will tell your server to automatically add domain.com to any host name it tries to look up that isn't already a FQDN
homelab,3e0gqn,ru4serious,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:40:18 2015 UTC,"just to be clear: my issue to resolving TO my Linux machines, not from. For example: one of them is for Sonarr, so it's FQDN is sonarr.domain.com. Well, in order for my phone or laptop to resolve it, I have to use the FQDN rather than what is in my DNS server, which is the obvious: sonarr tied to the IP as well the FQDN (so all 3 should work the same for ICMP requests). The thing is, it's only a few of my Linux servers..... The sonarr server iteslf can resolve everything just fine, event he offending laptop that can't resolve it."

(I don't know if they are iSCSI capable though)  GlusterFS Ceph I also see Nutanix compared with the Gluster/Ceph - but I am not familiar with it and I don't know if there is a community-based release."
homelab,3dxy74,mcai8rw2,8,Mon Jul 20 13:18:59 2015 UTC,"No, on all your assumptions.  A SAN is network over which storage is shared at a block level. The SAN could be Fibre Channel or Ethernet (or a mixture). If Ethernet, then it could use iSCSI, FCoE or ATAoE.  What you are referring to is a SAN attached chassis. It contains disk(s) that are shared with host(s) over the above mentioned SAN at a block level. This is accessed by the host(s) using the same protocols it uses to access local disks. Generally SCSI, but perhaps ATA. These protocols are encapsulated into whatever SAN protocol you are using."
homelab,3dxy74,chriscowley,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:01:56 2015 UTC,Thank you for the info. I think i get it :-)
homelab,3dxy74,SantaSCSI,4,Mon Jul 20 14:10:19 2015 UTC,"The big difference in storage is this: file or block. A SAN array serves block devices to a host, generally over a separate storage network, FC. A NAS serves up shares to a host, generally over a normal IP network.    In enterprise SAN's, the data protection is partially done on the array. (Nowadays, more protection is built into the application too) You create raid groups of disks, create a lun on top of it and serve this to a host over FC. The host will see the lun as a disk as if it was an internal disk, ie a block device.    Why SAN over NAS in homelabs? Depends on your current infrastructure, budget and what you want to achieve. For a lot of us, a simple box with some disks in RAID serving an NFS share is more than enough. Another option is iSCSI which also leverages your IP network, thus eliminating the need for a whole new network.   For ESXi, both are used (both in prod and test environments) and again depends on your infrastructure. Both iSCSI and NFS are easy enough to set up at home, with little design headaches.  On your other questions: * vSAN is a product of VMware to mimic a SAN environment and eliminate the whole idea of a separate SAN array. * The RAID setup is done on the SAN/NAS array and then served as a single disk towards ESX."
homelab,3dxy74,side_control,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:16:28 2015 UTC,Thank you very much. I don;t think a SAN is something I will try to introduce to my home lab. It seems expensive and unneccesary.  Cheers!
homelab,3dxy74,syshum,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:22:19 2015 UTC,"The point is storage for the home and to learn. I can tell you, learning storage, tuning it, down to the file system, how its replicated, how its presented its an absolute beast, personally I hate it, I'm not a hardware guy, but I want my test machines to be fast.   A SAN can provide storage for anything, ISCSI, Fiberchannel, NFS, CIFS are common on a SAN, not just for ESX. A good example is iSCSI, suppose you have a 1000 systems, you can carve out 1000 iSCSI LUNs for the OS partition on those systems. In the event of a failure, rip and replace and reattach to the LUN so you never scramble to recover the data.   Synology NAS ....it has NAS in the name. Not trying to be a prick, but what something is called, means something.   Usually with a SAN, you'll have a better fabric to connect to it, atleast 10G between the hosts to transfer/synchronize data.  vSAN usually refers to software defined storage, like adding numerous computers, replicated partitions to present one storage. Gluster for example, you connect x machines together, state that the storage you want to present resides on hosts 1-10, so you have 10  ways to get to the data, 10 paths to increase performance but its managed by software.   It depends on the SAN technology and how you want to do it, too many use cases to really answer the last question."
homelab,3dxy74,sanders54,2,Mon Jul 20 14:04:02 2015 UTC,"NFS, CIFS are common on a SAN,   These common on a NAS as they are NAS Technologies. a ""SAN"" sometimes have NAS functions, and ""NAS"" sometimes has SAN function.  SAN == Block Level  NAS == File Level  These used to be more separated on devices, and in some cases still are, however more and more hardware vendors are incorporating SAN and NAS technologies into a single device.    Gluster for example,   Is not a vSAN technology it is a DFS (Distributed File System) technology"

I'd just ask ""what would it take for me to take that stuff off your hands?"", or ""what's the plan for that crap in the back room? do we ever use that stuff?"". That's a gentle segue into taking it home with you. If they tell you that item A is to replace item B when it goes out, you know they have plans for it. If they tell you they're tired of tripping over it, that's your opportunity. By at least giving the appearance of being willing to pay something for it, you're probably going to get a better reaction that just asking to take it home outright. Chances are, if they don't really see a value in it, they'll just give it to you.  I'd definitely mention that you'd put it to good use, learning more about the trade.

We just got done throwing out 26 R720's that still have a year left on the warranty... 4 of them came home with me.  That said, simply asking to take a server home will get you the stink-eye look and you'll get shot down pretty quickly. They're just going to take you at your word that the server is formatted? If they want to confirm the security of the data, they have to dedicate a resource to do so? Forget that, it's much easier to just turn it over to the e-wasting vendor and get a CoD (Cert of Destruction). Surely there's a way to satisfy all parties, right?  Yes, and it's easy. Yank the drives. The company can keep the drives, or they can be turned over to the vendor for the CoD, and the rest can go with you. Most [of my] e-waste vendors charge by the pound, so cutting a few hundred pounds off the bill means we're saving a bit of money, but the Cert still comes in for the drives saying the data is secure.

I was shutting down the server so I can remove the hard drive and inspect the serial number etc. During the shutdown another one failed....  Now they seem to work just fine. Any idea what could have caused this? Oh and I lost all my data :P  EDIT: Actually after re-enabling it seems it is working again.

homelab,3dvy0o,puppynosee,5,Sun Jul 19 23:56:59 2015 UTC,"This would more likely be a raid or hdd issue. i doubt a driver would cause this. Toss in a smart start cd and see if you can get any more info from the card that way. If you are using HP drives, you should get some smart data passed through to the controller. My guess is you are not using hp drives.   I had something similar happen with some hitachi drives and a 3ware controller a few years ago. The drive would randomly go offline for a second or two. eventually the controller would fail it out. On reboot it would be found again and everything would be happy for a month or two. I pulled the drive and hit it with any and every tool I could find to check sectors, smart data, read/write solid for a week. Nothing. Put it back in the server, bam. same issue. My guess would be a drive that is not happy with the controller or a drive about to fail. HP raid controllers are picky about what non hp drives they work with.

We're talking a quad core 2ghz system with SSD pulling 20-25 watts idle and 25-30 watts fully loaded... and they're incredibly cheap.  I'm not doing adblock, but my system running squid shows 99% CPU idle while downloading 50 Mbps of http through it.  I bought an Asrock Q1900M (motherboard + CPU) for $55 and this gave me a pretty impressive NAS/squid server upgrade and wattage reduction for dirt cheap.  I added 2 cheap 4-port SATA cards and now have 10 hotswap bays running and still have another slot plus USB3 for expansion...  Yesterday I ordered a Biostar J1900MH2 (which is almost identical to the Q1900M) as an open-box for $50 and I'm going to use this to upgrade my Linux router (currently an Alix 2d13).  I expect this to easily handle routing up to a gigabit.  The CPU+motherboard are fanless.  I'm planning on mounting it in an old mini-tower case with an old power supply, and at that point the only fan will be in the power supply.  I'm thinking about disabling the fan in the power supply too so it is completely silent.  I figure if I'm pulling max 30 watts through a 450 watt power supply, it will probably be fine with the fan unplugged.  Obviously, completely fanless might not be so reasonable in a tighly packed 1U case, but the point is you don't need much cooling at these low wattages.  There are other J1900 boards, for example in mini-ITX format, but I chose these because they have normal desktop RAM slots (not laptop RAM) and 3 PCIe slots.  Even if I don't need 3 slots (like for a router), I felt that the extra flexibility was nice for the future.  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813157513  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813138416  Mini-ITX versions are smaller, but use laptop RAM and have 1 PCIe slot:  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813157497  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813157494  Anyway, it might not be right for you.  Modern higher end Atoms are faster than the J1900, but also use more watts and are significantly more expensive.  However, I figured it was worth pointing out as something to consider since I suspect even the J1900 is probably way more horsepower than you need."

Another option is pfblocker but this works based on an IP block level yet still accomplishes the goal. When I started my lab I quickly setup squid3 with caching, havp for virus protection and snort for general security. I received an earful fairly quickly from my main 'username' (my girlfriend) that many pages did not load.. she only bothered to tell me after a month of only using 4G on her phone. Long story short I disabled caching and everything was fixed. It really seemed to produce more issues than anything with only 2 users.

Probably what I would do if I was to go this route is keep AMD hosts in a different cluster altogether.   Good call separating out the AMD hosts.  You can cold migrate a VM from an Intel-based host to an AMD-based host (and vice-versa), but you cannot hot-migrate (ie, vMotion) between them.  There's no getting around that.  VMware does have a feature called EVC (Enhanced vMotion Compatability), but it cannot overcome the differences between Intel and AMD hosts.  EVC can be in three states - disabled, enabled for Intel hosts, and enabled for AMD hosts.  It basically strips out processor extensions beyond the level that you set, so that the virtual CPU is not using a feature that isn't available on a different host with an older CPU."

For home labs I prefer AMD over Intel. Yes they  use more power. But you get higher core density on AMD in the home lab for the $$$ vs Intel and for VMware higher cores is better.

Notice I was commenting on the piss poor and spec violating ripple/cross load issues with the supply, not wattage.  Dirty power is worse than no power.  I haven't see any measurements for the FSP but I know the old models always did pretty well. The low end OEM corsair uses have some terrible and often failing power qualities.  The transient load is more important on the 6 core CPUs with much higher loads, and effeciency wise the CX430 would be better served in the low end build considering that is where it's effeciency peaks.  http://tpucdn.com/reviews/Corsair/CX430_V2/images/efficiency.jpg"
homelab,3dvnoe,Dippyskoodlez,0,Mon Jul 20 02:12:37 2015 UTC,Agreed about dirty power. What are your thoughts on Thermaltake Smart Standard 550W 80 PLUS Bronze ATX12V 2.3 Power Supply SP-550P?
homelab,3dvnoe,testwerke2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:24:50 2015 UTC,Seems to hold a little tighter overall especially under transient load than the corsair but it falls off a little under full load. It should be okay as long as a GPU isn't involved: the lack of amd/ati and nvidia certification is mildly troubling(especially with the high visibility brand such as thermaltake). Only other worry would be the noise pointed out by the limited reviews.

Can't pass through GeForce cards unless you hard-mod them or run KVM which has some tricks to prevent the GPU from knowing it's in a VM. AMD is pretty much your only option unless you want to fork over hundreds for meh Quadro cards.
homelab,3dvavj,yokken,2,Sun Jul 19 22:14:16 2015 UTC,"I have two graphics cards in my main ESXi host. One is an AMD R9 290X, the second is an older Nvidia gtx680 that I modified the identification resistors on to register as an Nvidia Grid K2. The machine is dual CPU and I actually had a lot of trouble with a few other cards I had previously returned. I later figured out the issue was actually the fact that half the PCIe slots where connected to either one CPU directly or another causing a full system crash when esxi shuffled the numa nodes and moves the running OS to a different CPU. Once I moved the graphics to a PCIe lane connected to the motherboard chipset it solves my problem. Moral of the story is video passthrough can be very flaky to setup but since I've had it up I have had no issues for 6 months relating to passthrough. I will say however that none pro versions of the Nvidia  cards may not work at all (pro versions are the tesla, grid and quadro which are very expensive and is why I spent the time modding mine into a Grid K2). Many people my self included get an issue once the card is passed though to windows, the system refuses to actually initialize and enable the card. I use to be mostly an Nvidia guy and purchased and test two cards before returning both and settling on the AMD r9. Most people who have tried using Intel embedded graphics for passthrough have failed and I am yet to see a reliable setup. You could however get one of the NUC alternatives using the AMD A10 'APU' which has a AMD video card on the CPU die. I have seem that work fairly well.. Just remember none of this is actually supported by VMware so expect only community level best effort support. I also recommend not trying to save the few bucks to buy this stuff on eBay until you are 100% positive about your setup. Amazon has an amazing return policy which came in very very handy when doing the initial setup."

homelab,3dvavj,yokken,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:14:54 2015 UTC,"I did, I am an electrical engineer by education ( but software engineer by trade) and have done a few hobby level electrical projects. Although you really don't need any prior experience to get it right, I imagine it would be almost impossible to do well without some of the right tools. You really need a good soldering iron with a proper tip, good solder wick, quality precision tweezers and some sort of eyewear for magnification (or preferably a digital microscope, I used one I built a while ago with decent resolution and magnification for around $200 bucks). The issue is that these boards use SMD resistor of size 0402 which are basically the smallest commercially available right now. There are a few 'tips' I could give in terms of technique if you are interested but I'd recommend watching the EEVBlog. It did take a few tries to get it to work but the good thing is, the resistors you modify are really only used as a hardcoded way to set the identification code. They do not really drive any sensitive components. Meaning unless to burn a hole in the board it's a big hard to 'destroy' the card. Additionally as counter intuitive as it may be, make sure to only use leaded solder. Unleaded solder has a higher melting point and is in general much much harder to use correctly when doing hand soldering. Good solder is typically $30 bucks for a huge spool but you can get a solid 50ft piece off eBay fairly cheap.   What was the issue you had specifically?"
homelab,3dvavj,imanze,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:38:27 2015 UTC,Couldn't get the solder on the sides of the resistors hot enough. Didn't want to apply solder because I didn't want to bridge the pins and have no way to fix it. I do have a solder sucker but no proper sponges or anything. Honestly I'm not too upset about it after realizing my board's PCI-E x16 slot only operates at x8.
homelab,3dvavj,yokken,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:43:25 2015 UTC,"That was definitely the problem. Most of the cards use unleaded solder which is very hard to work with and master and even harder without the right tools. A solder wick is a trip of copper like meta mesh that can be cut into tiny pieces and once applied and heated with the soldering iron will actually absorb the solder but it needs a few seconds of heat so it's hard to really absorb the incorrect solder. You would be very surprised just how much a difference lead vs leadless solder makes. I will almost never use the unleaded kind because it's really pretty shitty. I respect the reason for why it's used in consumer electronics but for hobby work it's terrible. The melting point of leaded solder is typically around 361F (depending on specific alloy) vs unleaded at 422F making reflow work very hard. I would definitely not recommend an solder sucker because those things are huge and hard to use but with se wick and an iron set to a high temperature you should be able to easily repair whatever damage you have done. Lastly, a common mistake people make is thinking you need the thinnest possible tip for your iron to do this work, this is not the case at all. You actually want a wedge like iron with a well shapes but not tiny tip. You do not actually touch the iron to the component or the solder directly. You would take some liquid flux and spread it on the components, this will literally remove all the solder that is not on a metal pad. As you apply pressure to the resistor with tweezers with one hand, the other hand drags the iron across all the pads you need. Once the resistor pops off, use the flux and pad to remove all excess solder and throw it away. Once that is done you have a few clean metal pads without any crappy solder.. Now all you need is to tin the pads.. What this means is basically you are melting a small ball of solder perfectly on the pad and allowing it to solidly (not applying the resistor yet). This is like putting glue down where it needs to go so you can take your time with the component. Put flux across all the components around the pad, this will help solder only stick to the metal pads where it needs to go and repeat the same movement as before, eventually this leads little solder balls on the joints, and everything is prepped. Once that is done you will take some tweezers to hold the resistor in one hand and the iron in the other, line it up and heat up your solder joints on the board and apply light pressure.. BOOM!   I think you ready need to be into the electronic end of things to want to spend the hours doing it!"

homelab,3dshqn,bahwhateverr,3,Sun Jul 19 20:02:10 2015 UTC,Generally speaking the cables can be passive copper for short runs or active fiber for long runs. QSFP connectors are almost always used nowadays. These will handle up to FDR (56Gbps). Actually I think they'll handle EDR (100Gbps) but don't quote me on that.
homelab,3dshqn,shalafi71,3,Sun Jul 19 22:25:53 2015 UTC,"Yup. There's a distance limit on the passive copper cables that I think may depend on the speed you're wanting to run at. Been a while since I've done it, but I think you can do 40Gbps up to 5m or maybe a little further. Active optical cables can get much longer (100m), but are much more expensive and you'll need to make sure your switch port supports it (only 1/2 the ports on some of my 24p models would support active cables).   I think Mellanox started adding some smarts into the cables for the FDR stuff and the switches would supposedly make sure it was a ""supported"" cable. But I never tried cheaping out and buying non-supported cables so I don't know if it limits the rate it negotiates or anything like that."

homelab,3dux9n,imanze,2,Sun Jul 19 20:16:58 2015 UTC,"I also extensively use IPMI when possible but am starting to get more systems without it and am looking toward an IP based KVM. Toward the top of your budget you can get a brand new OmniView F1DP108G SMB. It's an 8 port KVM over IP that can be expanded and daisy chained. It basically has 8 Ethernet ports and then you would purchase a server interface module that has Ethernet on one end and USB and VGA on the other. The main unit is around $190 and each module can be had for 10-15 bucks... It has a web interface and seems to be a decent option. I also have more faith in Belkin than some unknown random Chinese manufacturer on alibaba.  I should add, the Belkin KVM over IP is by no means a ""best or even ""good"" solution. In the price range you mentioned, ~$200 its tough finding a good KVM over IP that does not suck. An alternative may be getting a decent 8 port KVM, I personally have had good luck with TRENDnet in the budget range so the TrendNET TK-803R for around $120 may not be a bad deal (8 port device). Then you get try an Avocent Switchview SVIP1020 KVM over IP ~$160. Basically you connect all your servers to the regular KVM and the Switchview connects to the KVM allowing you to broadcast it over IP using a Java based viewer. My understanding is the the Belkin one may actually only support ActiveX.. which is true makes it a useless piece of crap."

I use FreeNAS so I did not realize they already moved to 10 as I'm patiently waiting FreeNAS to do so with their stable version release. I do like that FreeNAS has ixSystems behind it along with the open source community, if some big bug becomes a problem for a paying customer it typically gets fixed fast. Then again I should mention that I no longer use FreeNAS for anything but the 'NAS components like iscsi, NFS, CIFS, rsync and AFP. Before building my virtualization servers I did use the plugin features and they worked great. I know NAS4free uses the smoothwall UI vs the  nginx + django in FreeNAS, do you have any feedback on how well it works?"

I find myself using the command line and cli more often anyhow. The use of FreeBSD 10 is fairly enticing and hard to overlook. Do you have any experience migrating pools created in FreeNAS 9 to nas4free 10? I can't anticipate any major issues but it's definitely something I will need to research!"
homelab,3dt6gg,imanze,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:59:24 2015 UTC,"I haven't tested migrating recently, but did a few years ago without problems. Only thing is I think FreeBSD 10 is using newer feature flags so if you upgrade the pool version you can't go back to FreeBSD 9. You don't have to upgrade the pool so it shouldn't be a problem."
homelab,3dt6gg,Balmung,0,Mon Jul 20 01:12:18 2015 UTC,"You can definitely do it on that budget, but when I first started I saw how small of a price difference you get when comparing 2TB vs 3TB vs 4TB drives I ended up waiting, saving some more money and just going balls to the wall. Your drive price will almost always be the biggest hurdle. I would look at making a spreadsheet with all desired/needed parts; CPU/motherboard/memory/case/psu/drives and try to balance it to get it into your price range. You could save money short term by buying a monster server that someone pulled from their data center used on eBay but the power consumption will kill any savings you make fairly quickly. In that price range I would look at Raid 1, 2 disks and maybe an embedded board with CPU (Intel atoms are great). If you don't want hardware raid (using ZFS) it's really recommended to do ECC memory which can be very limiting, and can't really be upgraded later without a full system rebuild (upgradability is typically very important for me). Then again if none of the data is important Id just slap together a basic i3 with 4/8gb of memory and a few drives. You may also be able to pick up a used older raid card and opt for something other than ZFS. I apologize I can't provide any specifics but I have not but many systems in that range lately so I don't want to recommend something that will fail a week later."

The reason I was saying WinServer2k12 was that my storage server is a Win2k12 box that runs a share for my domain. I'd rather not mess with getting *nix to play nice with windows shares after I spent 2 hours trying to get samba to join my windows domain.
homelab,3dslv9,mauirixxx,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:18:49 2015 UTC,"Ehhh there's easier ways. I run a Windows domain (2k8 r2) but I use a CentOS 7 VM to manage Plex/Transmission/Sickrage/Headphones.  On my Windows based file server, I simply share out a folder dedicated to the videos. Then I use Samba to mount that share in CentOS. All the above services manage everything right off the share. Here's a copy and paste from my personal wiki that I used to document the fstab entry:  The above works up to CentOS 6.x - for CentOS 7.x the new standard is as follows:  //192.168.1.8/Media /opt/remote-files cifs username=domainUsernane,password=changeme,uid=1000,gid=1000 0 0 uid & gid are the user & group ID's (respectively) of the user that has rw access to the file share       Hope that's helpful. The only downside to this setup in my experience, is Plex takes a few seconds longer to start on any video it has to transcode (because it has to copy the file over the network to a temp directory for the transcoding work). Most of my videos are in .mp4 format though, so mostly it's a non issue."

With that in mind I would recommend buying another 3TB drive and create two pools. Using drives as big as yours and assuming they are not SAS enterprise quality I would not use Raidz1z (I would not use it even if you had the best drives around). With raidz1 you are a single drive failure away from running vulnerable. With 3TB disks you have almost an 8% chance of another drive failure (and full data loss) during the time it takes to rebuild your array. With modern drive sizes the current standard is really raid6/raidZ2. Regardless you can create one pool with 43TB and a second with 2TB6. That leaves you with about 14TB of usable space, based on minimum recommendations for ZFS that would need about 16GB of ECC memory, depending on form factor, size, and power consumption id either go with a supermicro avoton or entry level Xeon."

At a minimum, I expect to have 24gb in this second box, and set my ARC limit around 8-12GB.    Again, this is not my primary storage spot, and have no issue with running raidz1. If I lost a drive, I probably wouldn't rebuilt...and instead start from scratch, and seed a new copy of my tier 1 + 2 data. At least, that's my current thinking if I just send a copy of data over.     Obviously, if I'm sending ZFS snapshots over, I would be a little more caring and would like take those 6 2tb drives and do a raidz2, which would yield ~8tb.  For now, 8tb should be plenty.    I'm not wanting to buy any new drives, since I already have several laying around.    I guess my real though is whether to just ssh a copy of my important data to a second system, do zfs snapshots, or something else.

homelab,3dseb4,just_insane,2,Sun Jul 19 01:35:54 2015 UTC,"That's a great question, which I'm happy to answer. It requires a little bit of historical context, though:  If you go back a few years, before Oracle bought out Sun, Sun had some open source work going on in the Solaris community between Solaris 10 and Solaris 11. (google ""Project Indiana"" to go down the rabbit hole). A lot of this awesome stuff ended up in an operating system called OpenSolaris. Well, Oracle came around and bought Sun, and closed up most of the open source projects.  In the meantime a lot of people left Sun (now Oracle) and went off to other companies who, through a coalition of people and corporations, continued the work of OpenSolaris as illumos, which is rather like the Linux kernel plus some of the really close-to-the-kernel userland stuff. A number of illumos distributions exist, that take illumos and make it more consumable for end users. One of my favorite distributions is OmniOS.  OmniOS could best be characterized as a minimalist general purpose UNIX operating system. There's no GUI. But OmniOS makes for a fantastic server OS, a really great hypervisor. kvm is already baked in. You've got ZFS throughout, software-defined networking, deep inspection capabilities through dtrace, etc. The service management facility in OmniOS, SMF, is more satisfying for me to use than any of the stuff cluttering up Linux these days (seriously, what's up with that?!?) I'm learning to appreciate the package manager, too (IPS)  The OS is free. You can buy support for it if you want. The community has been friendly and approachable, but a lot smaller than what you might be used to if you're coming from Linux."

The catch is that with these large drives, if a single drive fails then the likelihood of a second drive failing during the recovery process is something like 25-30% chance... And only grows with the size of drives. Since RAID5 only supports 1 drive failing, if another drive fails during the recovery period then you are screwed.  RAID6 was introduced to counter this issue."

Basically the idea is that given how long RAID5 rebuild times are due to disks having gotten so big, the chance of encountering a URE while repairing the array after a failed disk can get pretty high, if you get that URE, your data is toast. RAID6 is the next step, but we'll eventually outgrow that as well.  I think there are some calculators if you search for RAID5 URE calculator.  The big take really should be that RAID != backups."

If it does work as expected make sure you change your DHCP settings on the router responsible to handing out the lease to point to the dr-wrt box. If you are statically setting it make sure to change your machines DNS settings to point to it manually. As a side note, most people that are using dd-wrt for DNS are simply running it in forwarder mode only, do you have it setup as an actual server with DNS root servers configured or are you pointing it to a public DNS in forwarder mode for caching?

homelab,3dsoca,thesupergeek42,2,Sun Jul 19 02:04:56 2015 UTC,"Few questions, 1. Does it really need to be rack mount hardware?  When I started building my lab about a year ago I realized I can save a good amount of money by simply buying standard cases but using server grade components. I was able to fully assemble a few dual CPU, 8 core Xeon boxes from parts I sources on eBay/Amazon for much cheaper than I'd get anywhere else. More importantly it does not sound like a jet engine. 2. How quiet are you talking about? Racks are made to be put in server rooms that have correct ventilation and typically sound like a factory. They are not built with very much energy efficiency or sound concerns in mind. Sure you can start modifying stuff but why not do it the right way from the start and build it quiet and efficient. My electrical is up around $80 a month and I run all very 'efficient' components except for two graphics cards in one of the esxi nodes doing pssthrough for steam.    Do you have/need networking equipment? Anything you can use already would be great.   $1200 is a good chunk of change but it can go fairly fast. I think you should have an idea of what it is you are trying to run? For example I am not a fan of virtualizing storage so I fixated started by building my NAS. Then network with an all hardware pfsense box and managed switches, and lastly an ESXi node... Everything after that was just extra. What are your priorities? Do you have any experience with specific software or are you looking to learn a specific OS?"

There was 0 dust and everything has worked wonderfully.  If you want shitloads of storage you can get the r710 and upgrade to an H700 raid card for another $150 which will allow you to use disks bigger than 2TB. You're looking at about $700-800 there.

homelab,3drchd,houmoller,5,Sat Jul 18 18:38:43 2015 UTC,"Welp...you have alot of good options, i really like FreeNAS; in the coming months FreeNAS 10 will be starting to appear in alpha and such, so thats cool. As of right now 9.3 is stable, functional, and does ALOT of what most people need. I have a 4U Chassis loaded with 21 hdds, 7 for each pool in RAIDz3 (in theory i can loose 3 drives per pool, and still have my data). I will admit...it costs a decent amount for hdds, server grade hardware (preferably...); ECC RAM, Xeon CPU, compatible mobo, etc. As for easy to use, read the documentation a bit, fiddle around with it, follow instructions like do a burn in of your hardware, so you dont have a failure the first month or 2 and loose your shit. Secure, i would say yes..i mean i've never had any security concerns and if you do you can encrypt all the data on it, but with that comes some funny things (you can look into that if its something you want/need); the only alert i have ever gotten from FreeNAS since i fired it up Jan 1 2015..is my dumb ass had CAPS lock on and tried to login...Expandable...oh boy is it expandable...Lets say you start with a similar setup to mine, 7 hdds per pool, 3 pools = 21 hdds total, you load it with all 4Tb hdds, gives you ~48Tb theres some overhead and meta data, we'll call it 40Tb because its even...lets say you fill up 70% of it (with FreeNAS dont fill beyond 80%, you will have problems), now you pick up another 4U 24 bay chassis, you do NOT need a motherboard in this chassis, just a pass through SFF-8087 to SFF-8088 card (Internal SAS to External SAS), youd install either another M1015 + pass through SFF-8087 to SFF-8088 card and use 2 SFF-8088 cables to connect the chassis together, or just get a FreeNAS approved external SAS card, and use the same SFF-8088 cables. Now you have added ANOTHER 24 bays to your current setup. You want an IRL example, check out this beautiful setup here. I know its alot to read...but you have alot to consider, budget, power, noise, etc. I hope this helps, and if not hopefully others can point you in the right direction but thanks for reading."
homelab,3drchd,dxm765,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:59:19 2015 UTC,"Is it possible to start a setup like this slow? What I mean is, is it possible to use some of the hardware I have now, and then down the road upgrade the amount of disks and upgrade to server grade hardware?"
homelab,3drchd,imanze,3,Sun Jul 19 05:23:20 2015 UTC,"For FreeNAS it is unfortunately not possible to do this well. I had the same idea until I just went for it. For example they recommended at least 1GB of ram for every TB of usable space on your raid. Additionally if you care about your data you need to use ECC memory. If you happen to have stuff like this already, then great.. But I would not skimp on it especially if you care about your data. If you are curious why this is the same I recommended you visit the FreeNAS forums to better understand how ZFS works.   Lastly, an actual hard limitation of ZFS prevents you from simply adding hard drives to an existing pool. You must either upgrade all the hard drives in the pool to a bigger size allowing time for parity data to recover or you must make a new pool. Thus, say you go with the minimum recommended RaidZ2 (similar to raid 6) you will need 4 disks. If you buy 4 disks, 3TB each you will get only 6TB of space. Well that's all fine and good but if you want to add more space you can either add a second pool, meaning buy 4 more drives, or buy 4 drives that are larger and replace one at a time while data rebuilds. Then you can use/sell the others.   Don't let this dissuade you, I absolutely love FreeNAS, all the features it brings and everything I've learned as a result of using it."
homelab,3drchd,dxm765,2,Sun Jul 19 10:26:54 2015 UTC,"as /u/imanze said, its very difficult...some people do it, and they get away with it; other people try it and 1 of 2 things happens. 1) Theyre up and running and theyre impressed with themselves, until 2 happens. 2) one day they come home and realize they cant reach FreeNAS they check it out, its either not mounting the pool, or it says unavailable, or both; they get the pool mounted but then it comes up unavailable and theye try their damnedest to make it work, and 90% of the time suffer a loss of data... Now if you dont care about your data, then yea by all means start off slow... the difficult part with that is you have RAIDz1,RAiDz2, and RAIDz3, RAIDz1 gives you one drive that can die and still keep your data,RAIDz2 gives you 2, and RAIDz3 give you 3. RAIDz1 is almost never used anymore due to the size (4+ Tb) hdds that are out now, when you loose a drive and replace it, it gets reslivered (rebuilt) this put alot of stress on the current drives..and if you have another drive thats on the tipping point the resliver could send it over the edge and to fail...and that means you've now lost all your data on that pool. RAIDz2 is recommended because of such large hdds we see now, and the longer rebuilds in theory allow for a second drive to fail while reslivering and still have your data intact. I choose RAIDz3 because well, im ok with sacrificing storage space for extra protection. Now lets say you go alright, ill start with w/e hardware i have, i have x4 2Tb hdds that fit the profile (support TLER,prefered), and im gonna start cruising. So you have your server, you do RAIDz2, you're happy its all working, and you start working towards your new, better server. 6 months later, you have your new server parts in hand, you do a 1 month burn in of the hardware, and you decide to move your drives over, you import your x4 2Tb hdds, and it all works, YAY! But....now you have a hdd failure, and you never turned on any kind of SMART monitoring for the hdds, so a second one starts to fail while you resliver the first, oh no.... lets say at the end of the day, your data is find..but that was too close of a call? If you loose the data on there, the wife/gf/SO will kill your ass....so what do you do? You decide to make a RAIDz3 for better protection...but you cant just add drives to a existing pool...so youd have to buy 7-9 hdds, burn in, make your RAIDz3, and THEN you'd need to snapshot the data from the x4 2Tb drive pool, to your now RAIDz3. Then you'd be able to repurpose the x4 2Tb drives for whatever, or keep them as a RAIDz2."
homelab,3drchd,dxm765,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:07:09 2015 UTC,"Okay, I think I see the problem with a slow start. So the drive pool kind of needs to be though through from the beginning.  I thought about building a quick setup with 3x2tb, and when times come, just use this for a semi-safe storage place for non-essential data.   What about the other hardware in the nas? As I understand it, it is not a problem switching mobo, cpu , sata controller and stuff like that?"
homelab,3drchd,clintonsTwat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:00:33 2015 UTC,"You can change motherboard and CPU very easily, FreeNAS OS itself doesnt really care, there are some hickups that may cause you to reinstall the OS...but long as you have a backup of your config, all you need to do is load the backup config and it will gather everything. For the SATA controller a highly favored one is the M1015 it would then be crossflashed to no longer be a RAID card, and would become a HBA, simply it adds SAS/SATA ports.. You would pair the M1015 above with SAS to SATA breakout cables which then turn the SAS port into 4 hdd SATA connections, and are displayed to the OS as single hdds."

For example, if you had a >100mbit internet connection and running an 857 you'd be in trouble, or if you needed to set up a few VLAN's and the firmware didn't support it."

homelab,3drv7u,ianc1215,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:42:56 2015 UTC,If you were to go for larger drives I'd consider the switch to RAID-6. with the 146GB drives you are looking at around a 1-2 hour rebuild time. That's not that much of a risk to having more drives failing as you see with larger drives which is where the RAID6 recommendation comes into play.

Especially since you say you don't have a programming background, it's probably not a good project to get started on.

homelab,3dqgx4,JimenJi,0,Sat Jul 18 14:38:46 2015 UTC,"In that case, my recommendation as a high school Java level programmer (I have no experience) would be to have a bunch of loops, probably one for each thing you want to monitor, and figure out how to ping something, and then have a if than statement to figure out if the proper reply was achieved then May that to a graph.  I wouldn't do it in Java though. Maybe Python, but I'm not sure if a web development language would be better for the actual ping and loops. You'd need it for the graph most likely.  Just my 0.02.

With etherchannel it is even better -> https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/EtherChannel  You get two ports with the same mac address, so a single session can use the combined aggregate bandwidth.

A source-destination MAC address or IP address pair is hashed, and the result is used to decide which EtherChannel member will be used for that flow. All of the data for a given flow will use a single member port in the channel. While this can give you the full aggregated EtherChannel bandwidth between two devices, it cannot give you more than one port worth of bandwidth between two end points, unless you use multiple IP addresses on the end points and send data in multiple streams that can be hashed to use different channel member links."

homelab,3dn4qd,BloodyIron,16,Sun Jul 19 00:40:24 2015 UTC,"There are a couple of reasons.  1) IB can, and sometimes is, very fickle about firmware versions. It's very ""fiddly"" to get everything to work together correctly.  2) IB doesn't support larger MTUs for IPoIB on older hardware (like those listed on ebay). Not a deal breaker, but can lead to issues in certain work loads.  3) Not everything supports RDMA. RDMA is where IB really shines. If your application doesn't support RDMA then you are generally left with IPoIB which has some limitations and support can be a bit spotty.  4) Ethernet just works. There is a long established history of integration of ethernet components and you generally know that if you get an network card from Intel, and a switch from Cisco, Arista, or whomever it is just going to work.  I guess my point here is that IB isn't the panacea it's higher throughput numbers make it out to be. There are still trade offs hidden in the lower layers that aren't immediately obvious.   As an aside: my ""home lab"" is really a test bed for a production deployment. So my mindset comes at it from that angle. What would I feel comfortable deploying in a production environment? For me, that's 10Gb ethernet. Am I trading some performance and money for that? Yes. Absolutely. God knows I could use 40Gbps, but not at the expense of my peace of mind in that environment.  Background: I have a production 10Gb ethernet network right now powering our Ceph cluster (backing an OpenStack environment). A buddy of mine has a similar setup using IB and IPoIB (even though Ceph does support RDMA - he opted for IPoIB because it was ""easier""). His numbers on the read side of his cluster (~1.5GB/s) compared to mine (about ~1.1GB/s). I opted for read performance because that is where the line rate is a limitation rather than other subsystems in the chain (ceph journals, osds, cpus, etc)."
homelab,3dn4qd,expressadmin,4,Sun Jul 19 02:50:56 2015 UTC,"1) Good to know, but what about the 20gbps or 40gbps stuff I linked?  2) Hmm, that's curious. Thanks!  3) Well, there's also NFSoIB man. That can be applied in a bunch of spaces. Namely storage to hypervisors. The demonstrations I've seen show impressive performance of NFSoIB, and Oracle/SUN implement this too.  4) From what I've been reading IB cards that match the spec should work in similar fashion. Yes, there's a bit more configuration to do, but from what I've been seeing, not much more than Ethernet. But, it isn't the be-all end-all.  5)  I wasn't presenting it as the catch-all. More presenting the comparative pricing information. It's applicability should be addressed on a per-case basis. It is, however, proven tech in the HPC industry, a very sensitive to suckyness sector. Appropriately implemented it should work in other sectors.  6) Why is your buddy doing IPoIB instead of say NFSoIB? Those figures seem to favor your buddy?"
homelab,3dn4qd,BloodyIron,7,Sun Jul 19 03:13:55 2015 UTC,"We have opted for Ceph for a couple of reasons.    Ceph is tightly integrated with the OpenStack ecosystem. Specifically subsystems like Glance (image storage), Cinder (block storage), as well API compatibility with Swift (Object Storage like S3) all integrate with Ceph with no problem (Cinder and Glance both use rbd - rados block device) and Swift integrates with Ceph's native object store called rados. Ceph scales extremely well. With a near linear scaling model. As you add more capacity, the performance of your cluster also increases (more nodes with more connectivity means more clients can get the data at line rate since it is spread out more). Ceph has some very neat technology under the hood that traditional network file systems don't have. Thin provisioning on block devices. Copy on Write block devices (basically you can take an image and use it as the base of another image instantly). So provisioning a server instance is incredibly quick. Generally less than 10-15 seconds. Avoiding SPoF. Ceph data is distributed and replicated through out the cluster (and that is configurable). So you can have as much or as little redundancy as you feel comfortable with. So you can have a three node cluster and with a replica level of 1, you can lose one node from the cluster (and that includes the entire thing... all drives contained within that node) and the system will continue to work with no loss of data (performance is obviously impacted due to the lack of data replicas). Coupled with MLAGs (Multichassis Link Aggregation) and things are pretty redundant. In addition you can specifically craft your failure domains. So you can have multiple storage drives in a node and Ceph is smart enough not to store any redundant placement groups within that same node. In addition you can even go so far as to control things to the cabinet, row, and even datacenter failure level if you have the facilities to do so. Ceph has caching tiers. So if you start to develop performance issues you can create a super fast caching layer within the cluster and systems will automatically start using it for hot data, and the Ceph nodes will purge ""cold data"" to slower storage nodes. It's cheap. Granted not as cheap as a single server with a crap load of drives in it, but still a good three node cluster can end up costing about $9K. You can build cheaper ones too, but you start to sacrifice performance and for us, we are looking for good iops performance, and I think we might have it. Our current three node cluster does ~600MB/s writes, and ~1.1GB/s reads. Our new version, should hopefully max out the writes to ~1GB/s as well. As a comparison: A SolidFire SAN (which is admittedly the balls out leader in iops) is about $100K - $150K for a SAN of about 20-40TB. Granted you also get +200K iops with that. :)   Now on to your questions:  1) From my experience this applies to most stuff even the 40Gbps stuff. I am trying to find a quote from my buddy on IM where he was struggling getting his Mellanox stuff to play nicely. There was something neat about pushing firmware updates down from the switch though... that's pretty cool.  3) I was not really aware of NFSoIB, but then like I said I focus on the OpenStack ecosystem (and seriously... if you are building chops for getting a job... learn OpenStack. It takes a while, but RH will hire you in a heartbeat if you know what you are doing. I have had two job offers from them already.)  6) Mainly for the reasons I listed above regarding Ceph. He wanted it up and running first and then working on performance later. We have since learned that Ceph's data writing profile is very specific in how it works. So you need to really optimize certain ""paths"" in the data. Specifically the journals as they are atomic and need to be as fast as possible in order to maximize throughput. Oddly enough consumer grade SSDs don't fit well into that, and you need to look at other options to get true performance.  I am currently in the process of building up a Ceph cluster that utilize NVMe (Intel 750s - mmmm 230K write iops) to work around some of these specific areas.  TL;DR; Ceph is bad ass. You should check it out."

Mixed and matched many kinds until SDR was finally EOLed.  Granted, IB does not do routing, but we are switching from 10GigE to IB at my work, and I just smiled seeing full bandwidth over the pipe vs the 10GigE rates always being subpar."

homelab,3dn4qd,Reversi8,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:40:06 2015 UTC,well....  you need SFP+ adapters for that so it is a bit more expensive.  and then you need switch with SFP+ and another SFP+  or DAC cable  so it is a bit more expensive than that

homelab,3dn4qd,mthode,4,Sun Jul 19 04:25:03 2015 UTC,"So yeah. Why go 10gbps Ethernet again?   Where is your connectivity to your non-Infiniband devices? There isn't a single bridge on eBay and from my research, they run almost $10k retail. That means your only option is to build your own bridge. (Good luck getting an x86 computer to bridge 10Gbps at anywhere near wire-speed.)  Regardless, Infiniband is great if you're cool with buying an EoL technology (like Token-Ring) and just simply need the throughput. (And have your storage isolated, like in a virtualized environment)  It's a terrible choice when it needs to integrate into your entire network."

homelab,3dn4qd,BloodyIron,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:02:48 2015 UTC,"There's only two companies creating equipment - Mellanox and Intel. Intel has already dumped Infiniband for their own Omni-Path product (which is built on other technology they acquired from Cray).  That leaves just Mellanox. Mellanox is moving into Ethernet by using their Infiniband experience to create really interesting things, and while their IB sales are good now it is a shrinking part of their business. The next few years will be interesting to watch and see if they continue to pump a huge amount of time and money into a technology that isn't exactly showing huge growth.  Another problem with Mellanox is that they depend on a small number of large customers for a significant amount of their sales. A superior technology like Omni-Path from a huge company like Intel could very easily force them to stop creating Infiniband very easily."

homelab,3dn4qd,willglynn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:10:41 2015 UTC,"Why exclude Cat6a 10GbE?  10GbE RJ-45 NIC's are in the range of $200-250 each, and you can get a NEW Netgear 10GbE switch for under $1k.    May not be 24 port, but I seriously doubt many people in /r/homelab land need 10GbE to 24 devices at home.  The Netgear XS708E (8-port) can be had as low as $800.  It may not be as cheap as IB, but it's still relatively cheap for 10GbE, if you only need it for a handful of servers (i.e., 8 node Ceph cluster with 10GbE backend), or 3 ESXi nodes with a FreeNAS filer.    It's worth noting that Netgear does have a 12-port model in the $1,400 range, and a 24-port model in the $4,000 range.  Hoping to see these pop up used in another year or two.    FYI, I tried running a 3-node Ceph cluster with 4 OSD's per node (sharing a SSD journal) and performance just wasn't that great for me.  If I could get a 3-node Ceph cluster with performance that would max 1GbE, I'd be uber happy with a setup like that.  I would use it for OpenStack block storage, but also CephFS which just isn't mainstream enough yet (I don't like running virtualized storage systems).    20/30/40 Gb/s is awesome, but very few people in /r/homelab will be able to see those speeds, assuming they had that kind of setup.  40Gb/s with 7200RPM drives would require over 40 drives to even get theoretically close to that.  Even with 10 x 5TB drives in a RAID 10 (ZFS), I'm having trouble saturating quad GbE in LACP.  I can do it if I try, but day to day of running my 18 VM's and serving media, it's less than a single GbE NIC.  Anyway, just my two cents and experience with Ceph/10GbE."

I'm using Proxmox VE for my VMs, and I'm unsure what I could do with OpenStack myself that would be useful for me.  20gbps isn't that hard to attain with ZFS, 30/40 is a bit more challenging but with how ARC works, you can very quickly hit awesome speeds.  How are your 10x5TB drives setup? What's the width on your vdevs? How much RAM do you have for ARC? What's your ARC hit%? Also, LACP doesn't enable you to have single sessions leverage the increased bandwidth, it's for multiple sessions, unless you do stuff like EtherChannel.

Anyway, I have multiple systems accessing my data, so I get benefit from LACP, and I know it doesn't increase bandwidth of a single session.

Running Proxmox 3.4, and have ARC limited at 48GB. All my datasets are shared out via NFS, but my VM's live on local storage outside of ZFS.  HIT% is 97-100%, generally.     So yeah, I have no need for 10Gbps networking, since all my file stuff is done on one box. Some VM's access my ZFS storage via NFS, but that's through virtio.    I have only 2 desktops hardwired, along with 2 TVs hardwired. Everything else is wireless.    Before this box I was going to go hyperconverged on 3 Dell C2100's using Openstack and Ceph. It would fulfill the same things as my current box; VM's and file level storage. CephFS is too new for performance, and Ceph block performance didn't impress me at 3 nodes, 12 OSD's total.  If I went bigger, I probably would have used it.    I'm looking to build a second 2U box to back up critical data (I use Crashplan so I already have 2 copies of all my data), and with this second box I'd probably do 10 GbE, ad-hoc, with CX4 connections. Cheap, and easy. Initial seed would be like 5TB, but hourly sync would be very very minimal that 10 GbE would almost seem like a waste.    Lastly, I run about 18 VM's, all CentOS except a Win10 box. OpenLDAP, BIND, Subsonic, Plex, SAB/SickRage/CouchPotato/Headphones, Deluge, Stash, Salt, bliss, phpIPAM, Guacamole, and a few other things. I run all external services through a Nginx Reverse Proxy, where I have a paid wildcard ssl cert.  Also have a VPS with Vultr running mail-in-a-box, for email, CardDav, and CalDav. Use the same ssl wildcard there.    Warning, on mobile so formatting might suck. Sorry for the dump, but that's my current environment and use case."

Depends. If you have a storage box and a virtualization host, a pair of 10 gigabit Ethernet NICs and a twinax SFP+ DAC would be cheaper than the Infiniband options you outlined.  Sure, a switch with 24 SFP+ ports will end up being expensive, but I suspect very home labs need that many fast ports. If you want a managed 24-port GigE switch with 4 SFP+ switch ports, that can be had for $460. If you want a VLAN-capable 24-port GigE switch with 2 SFP+ switch ports, that's only $239."

homelab,3dn4qd,BloodyIron,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:33:27 2015 UTC,"gige isn't even in the realm of this discussion, too slow.   GigE is in the realm of this discussion if we're looking at switching needs in a home lab. I think that a typical home lab needs only a low port count for 10+ gigabit for a handful of fast servers and/or switch uplinks, while needing a higher port count for slower devices with which you'd still like to communicate… like, say, a cable modem, and some wireless access points, and everything else that's not part of your home lab but is nonetheless in your home.  GigE is relevant because of the way it relates to 10 GigE. You can use one switch/one network to make everything talk to everything else if you stick with Ethernet.   That SFP+ NIC, never seen that manufacturer before, but yeah couldn't find that particular listing when I did look. Sounds kinda too good to be true if you ask me. Fell of a truck or is flaky.   I bought one most recently for $29.99 a couple weeks ago. I pushed 20 TB of ZFS snapshots overnight before shipping that machine off site. Worked great.  Chelsio NICs are well-supported in Linux, FreeBSD (including FreeNAS), and VMware ESXi.   Why sell for $32 when you can sell for more?   People are retiring earlier SFP+ NICs (e.g. Chelsio T3 chips) in favor of newer ones (e.g. Chelsio T5 chips) because they want new hardware features and because vendors no longer offer support contracts on legacy hardware. Supply and demand does the rest."

I like having 2 NIC's so i can do 1 for management and vMotion, and the other for VM's only, you could deff configure both NICs for 2 different networks, youd want either a switch that supports VLAN's to accomplish being able to have the management NIC on both networks but only VMs on the 10.x.x.x network.

With a bit more budget (under $1,000) you could have 12 cores and 72GB RAM very easily (do an auction search for ""DL160 G6"" or ""Dell C1100"")."

I have 2 of the ASRock boards with 32G of ram in them. You max at 64G. The board has 12 Sata ports. If I had to do it over I would have gone with the Supermicro. The memory would have been a little more expensive but the out of band network is far superior to anything ASRock offers.  These are both significantly more expensive than the HP Microservers but offer much more flexibility and lower operating costs.

My eventual goal would be to add small FreeNAS with zfs and another one offsite for backups.  For staying cheap and using your existing stuff. I'd say keep it lightweight and simple.

Obviously this is a more expensive option, but I think would be the ideal solution in your case.  If budget is even less concern, the QNAP NAS devices can run VMs. I'm running a TS-451 with my Mythtv backend and some other linux servers at the moment.

Behind the router I have about 15 VM's continiously running and I have openVPN enabled to be able to connect to my VM's via the internet.

homelab,3dm1y3,Zergom,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:01:12 2015 UTC,"I have 2 NIC's in my servers (with 1 ethernet port each, so 2 ports in total).

After that I installed pfsense inside a vm (2.2.2 I believe), installed some packages etc etc. It works like beauty!  The reason I needed 2 nics is because I wanted the pfsense box to be the central router, all the other devices are connect to the switch (which is connected with nic2/port2)  I hope this makes sense to you, if you have any questions feel free to ask!"

So you would create an interface in your Hyper-V VM using an untagged VLAN for your internet traffic, and a different untagged VLAN on a different interface for internal traffic.

This will allow you to pass the physical NIC into a VM and get the hardware benefits without the vNIC layer bogging down that connection. Then to connect it to a switch and back into VMware via another NIC or something like that.  Of course the above assumes I understand exactly what you are doing which I may not.

Just be aware of the fact that Sophos UTM requires full configuration if want to use it to surf the internet and not be blocked. By default it is very locked down and it's not plug-and-play like Untangle or pfSense.

homelab,3dikhd,mostlikelyathrowaway,9,Thu Jul 16 18:26:09 2015 UTC,"For directory and authentication you generally use LDAP and Kerberos (from what I understand this also forms part AD, it is just under the hood). If you want something more turn key then there is a RedHat backed project called FreeIPA (their RedHat Identity Manager is just this with vendor support really). FreeIPA will handle Kerberos, 389 (sorta a stripped down OpenLDAP), sudoers, authentication, SELinux policy (haven't messed with this part yet so not sure how complete it is), DNS, and TLS/SSL certs. FreeIPA is really easy to install and use.  If you have Windows boxen you want to author against it there is supposed to be a way to tie Samba 4 in, but I have not done it, so can't advise you there."

Coming from any other platform to Linux is much easier. Not trying to warn you away, but to just say... be patient. This is likely to be very new for you. Don't get too caught up in trying to find pointy clicky ways to do things.

homelab,3dikhd,BaCoN_BaD,6,Fri Jul 17 03:44:45 2015 UTC,I have no actual evidence behind this but I've always thought it best to leave AD and Exchange on a Windows machine.

homelab,3dikhd,technicalthrowaway,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:20:40 2015 UTC,Isn't it possible to work around the expiration problem with a configuration management solution like Puppet/Ansible/Chef? When your licenses expire have Puppet rebuild your environment with maybe a Samba4 server as a backup DC
homelab,3dikhd,Magnus919,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:04:25 2015 UTC,That really is the best approach.  Basically any place you'll go that runs Linux will also have AD and other Windows services running.  Your best bet is to learn to make these environments coexist.  Find an itch that needs scratching and stand up a Linux machine to get it done.
homelab,3dikhd,mj2t,3,Thu Jul 16 22:15:56 2015 UTC,"If you need Active Directory (e.g. Windows AD compatible AD) then you'll probably want to consider Samba4 (specifically: this guide might help).   Personally, I found it pretty challenging to get Samba4 working, if not just because of the variety of documentation. But it does include things like built in DNS (or the ability to use BIND for more complex setups). Not sure about DHCP, I've always done statically allocated stuff. You'll need to install kerberos too - again, a bit of a pain due to fragmented documentation and variance across distros. You can also use Windows RSAT to administer things once you've got Samba4 initially setup.  Regarding exchange services, that's not included in Samba4. Another option for exchange like features (e.g mail, contacts, general groupware stuff) is Kolab. I've not used that, but it should work alongside Samba4 via LDAP  If you just want AD like features, and don't need Windows machines joining, then apparently FreeIPA is supposed to be a better option (although I've not looked into it properly) but it supposedly doesn't work well with Windows. I don't think it aims to be an AD compatible system. Again, I think this will just do authentication, DNS and such, not exchange services.  Hope this helps, please report back on what route you end up taking and how it goes!  edit: just to be clear, I'd advise you think about why you want to do it. If it's just for the fun of it/learning experience, then fine (although I think you've got to be pretty narcissistic to enjoy this particular setup). But it's probably far far easier, faster, and more reliable just to keep a Windows Server machine around for this stuff (I assume - I've never used Windows Server for AD).  edit 2: setting up Linux AD clients also seems to vary wildly across distros. Google PBIS, and sssd"
homelab,3dikhd,TheTechStewart,2,Thu Jul 16 16:04:37 2015 UTC,Thanks I'll look into Samba4 and Kolab.  The only reason for doing this was to try it out kind of for fun and in the pursuit of knowledge... I've set up windows domains and all the associated services countless times know and while it is still enjoyable it is starting to become repetitive. I thought my basic linux knowledge could do with a boost by setting some of this stuff up.
homelab,3dikhd,devianteng,3,Thu Jul 16 18:16:50 2015 UTC,"Exchange is going to be hard to recreate, because I think you'll find that much of the Linux community has a fairly pervasive sense of disdain for the product. Linux has UNIX heritage, after all, and the UNIX philosophy is to build tiny tools that do specific jobs really well and then write glue scripts around them to do more complex jobs. The whole notion of Exchange is kind of an affront to that, so there's not much in the way of community ambition to emulate it."

I tried with OpenLDAP and OpenDirectory (OS X server implementation) and both really suck.   I run an AD Domain Controller VM using windows server core to keep it as minimal as possible. I only use it for a few servers that need it for auth but it also handles DHCP and DNS for its network segment.

Serial connections made no sense to me reading all the books, but having two routers and physically connecting them with a t1 cable made it all click together.  Craigslist was my source for equipment. If you are patient, you can get some amazing deals. I paid about $220 for 9 x 1841 routers, 3 x 3550 switches, and 1 x 2801 router. You want to make sure you can run the newer versions of Cisco IOS on your routers.

You could team/bond the 2 4Gb ports together that would give you more throughput but remember now youre at the mercy of the mechanical rust....thats where my bottle neck is, if i had 1 array of all SSD's i'd be able to better saturate my 10Gb, right now i can get up too 320MB read/write and then it hangs around 270-300 depending on what kind of data. I use my SAN to store all my ESXi VM's , i have 2 hosts that access it and i havent run into any IO issues, but now i use Veeam for backups and Veeam determined my storage is the bottleneck (which i figured).

The graphics card, simply because it was a shame to cheap out given the quality of the rest of the build. I don't game.  I've run multiple dedicated labs in the past and figured a dedicated single host with a nested environment might be the way to go this time.   I previous had a 5820K setup which happily run 20 VMs so this is certainly up to the task. I agree that eventually memory might become an issue but it's good enough to run a significant number of VMs' at present.  The 5960x CPU is benchmarked at 16026, which beats the Dual Hex-Core Servers I have (11682) so I certainly don't think it's underpowered."
homelab,3djcrt,spiralout112,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:31:10 2015 UTC,"I just find it interesting, if you don't game, and are so concerned with power, drop the graphics card, it won't give you much of a benefit unless part of your lab is rendering.  I guess it seems like throwing money at a noise problem?  Personally, I'd pick up a used commercial server, that is 3-4U. Test the noise, if it's too loud, try spinning down the fan speed but keep an eye on the temp. If it's still too loud, aftermarket fans are cheap, Can even store them in another room to keep noise down, and remote in, as it's a server, it's almost built to be headless.  With the savings difference, could slap in a few 500GB SSDs for VMs/Host OS, maybe a few 2-4TB HDDs for surplus storage. And upgrade the ram to about 128GB ram.   With the left over money, you could pay for the power of the server for 6 Months - 1 Year + depending on your power costs.  (Edit, forgot to mention headless access)"
homelab,3djcrt,_Coeus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:54:50 2015 UTC,"As I said it seemed a shame to cheap out on the graphics card given the rest of the specifications. The cost isn't really an issue and as the machine will run most of the day with the monitor off the GPU won't be using much power.   I have two DL380 G7s', which I bought to test some lab scenarios on but the noise is quite bad and would require me to place them in a small room (5ft x 3ft) which currently has no electricity and would need soundproofing. Ventilation may also be an issue in the summer as it only has a small vent to the outside. It just seems like a lot to go through if the a single nested machine could do the trick.  Food for thought.

I've seen issues before where ISP provided modems (specifically Verizon/Frontier) used a private subnet that often conflicted with other consumer routers. I've also seen, from Charter specifically, ISP provided modems not allowing customer routing inside their own network. The way around that was the plug your PC into the ISP provided modem and verify that you can access the internet, then log onto your router and clone your PCs MAC address on it, thus fooling the ISP provided router that it was just another PC attached NIC."

So, the 8GB server is where Exchange, MySQL and MSSQL all live.  I carve them out a 30GB C: drive, and put all the data on SATA.  This allows the OS to perform fast, but the workloads will run a bit slow.  Everything else goes onto the 16GB server.  So, SCVMM, SCCM, SCOM, DPM, all of these applications all hooked into a single MSSQL box.  I was going to install vCenter to it but opted out.

In the configuration, you tell dnsmasq what upstream dns server to connect to, in this case, dnscrypt. You have dnscrypt listen on something like 127.0.0.2:5353, and dnsmasq should be configured to use that address as its dns lookup server.

homelab,3dgobh,doneski,4,Thu Jul 16 03:11:13 2015 UTC,You won't get condensation because the air conditioner will remove humidity. That's what aircons do. I have run servers in rack(s) in just normal enclosed rooms with a single split system running 24/7 at 22c (71.6f). Without issue. You will save a lot of electricity running the aircon at 26 - 28c (78.8 - 82.4f) which studies have shown are more than suitable for server environments.  Sure not data centre perfect but it is perfect conditions for the kind of operation you are running.  To ensure condensation doesn't happen when you start up the best bet would be to get the room down to temperature (hence dehumidified) before turning servers off.  My 2c.

Ideally you want an email/buzzer alarm at like 90 and shutdown/power cut at some higher temp.  source: Did this, aircon broke, was glad I had an alarm.

With your current equipment, you can get by with just a smart switch that allows vlans, but you can also add a couple more routers, a managed layer 3 switch and a managed layer 2 switch or two to really learn more about switching and routing.  If your goal is to get in to networking and get your CCNA and beyond,  you will ideally want at least 2-3 routers and 3 switches. Two or more routers will allow you to learn more about routing protocols like OSPF, EIGRIP, and RIP. Three or more, with serial interfaces, will allow you to learn about frame relays. Three or more switches will allow you to see how spanning tree works. But you can also do all of this stuff with GNS3 and/or packet tracer."

From what I can tell though, it seems like your main focus is on the server side of things. Can you give me an example of a situation or scenario you would be in or want to simulate on a network side?  My assumption is that you just need to be able to replicate an enterprise level network to simulate your processes. If this is the case, you really don't need anything too crazy. The 3560 will do you well since it is a layer 3 switch and has all of the functions you would need to learn about switching, but it is by no means a quite fan. I have 3 x 3550s.

homelab,3dfe3n,Aundhe1m,4,Wed Jul 15 21:00:59 2015 UTC,Direct connected storage as you are talking about is getting a lot less common. By all means learn it but I suggest learning about IP based storage solutions. Do some research on iSCSI and look at deploying that. It will also be good for learning networking skills which you will need. Rather than buying an LSI RAID controller get a 4 port NIC expansion card. Have a look at some of the 4 - 8 bay NAS's on the market that have multiple NIC's and support iSCSI. The more NIC's the better and ensure they can be teamed for throughput. You will probably need to look at a layer 2 switch for this. You can serve them up like local storage in the Hypervisor (virtualisation) to your guest servers.  That is how the industry is doing things with current technology.
homelab,3dfe3n,Poncho_au,2,Thu Jul 16 08:01:48 2015 UTC,"Slendid input, The biggest problem with getting some serious NAS gear is the money.

homelab,3dfe3n,Poncho_au,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:40:34 2015 UTC,In fact that is probably an even better idea. Just serve up your ZFS storage with iSCSI target software on debian and map it on the initiator in your host (VMWare etc.).  That switch should be well suited to supporting this setup as long as it supports VLAN's (I'm pretty confident). Should be a great learning exercise.  I am planning on getting a similar setup with ZFS once I get the hardware to build a nice storage box.

homelab,3dedzb,andyr354,3,Wed Jul 15 16:51:49 2015 UTC,"Does that switch have a CLI or just webpage? HP sticks with tagg/untagged terminology, opposed to Cisco's access/trunk terms.  A trunk port in Cisco is a tagged port in HP (capable of passing multiple VLANs with 802.1q tags). An access port in Cisco is an untagged port in HP, for traffic (typically from end-devices) with no 802.1q tags.  So if you had this config in Cisco:  int g0/1 switchport mode access switchport access vlan 5 ! int g0/2 switchport mode trunk switchport trunk allowed vlan 5,10,15 !   The HP equivalent would be:  vlan 5 untagged 1 tagged 2 ! vlan 10 tagged 2 ! vlan 15 tagged 2 !   If that switch doesn't have CLI, its the same concept, you just need to futz with going to the port, selecting the VLAN, then specifying if it should be tagged/untagged."
homelab,3dedzb,chuckbales,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:08:53 2015 UTC,"I think an 1800 and a 1700 are similar configs, just the 1700 is 100mb only.  Here's a snapshot I took of one at work.  You'll notice that port 1 is untagged for VLAN 200 (has a cheap VoIP ATA on it that doesn't get VLANs)  Under VLAN Setup, I added VLAN 200, selected it on the radio button, then clicked modify on the bottom.  I then checked all the ports to make them tagged for 200 (couple of VoIP phones on other ports that do understand VLANs)"
homelab,3dedzb,jududdar,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:20:50 2015 UTC,"Ok, so lets say I add three new VLANS 20,30,40 I would add those and add them to all ports?  Then if have a device on port 1 that is on VLAN 20, and I want it to only see VLAN 20 traffic would setting the PVID be sufficient?  What setting do I need on the port that uplinks to my router that is on port 24?"
homelab,3dedzb,jududdar,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:34:19 2015 UTC,"My post might have been misleading now that I re-read it.  I put VLAN 200 on all ports so they can use a VoIP phone on any of them - in this particular office, people move around a lot.  For a port to your router, which I assume is routing VLANs since the 1800 is an L2 switch, you would want to add all VLANs it can see to the ""uplink"" port on the switch.  Then, if you want to plug a PC into port 1 that needs to be natively on VLAN 20, it needs to be the PVID of port1.  If we go back to Cisco terms (forgive me, I'm an HP guy through and through, but I think I understand them), the port to your router is a trunk port, so under the VLAN Setup option is where you make trunks - or ""tag"" ports in HP terms.  For port 1, it looks like you're wanting an access port, so you would set the PVID to whatever you want it to be - or ""untag"" in HP terms.  In the event of a device that understands VLANs, such as a VoIP phone, setting the port in trunk mode is fine, as you'll then tell the phone that it resides on a VLAN, instead of having to make the port's access VLAN whatever the phone needs.  At each campus (schools) we have anywhere from 500 - 1500+ switchports spread about the school.  We throw our VoIP VLAN tagged on every port so we don't have to reconfig every time somebody moves.  I have a principal that likes to drag his phone with him elsewhere in the building if he's expecting an important call - that lets him do that on the fly without having to call me.  Tag and untag are mainly used on the Procurve switches with a command line."

I don't know the exact ratio requirements of RAM and Hard drive space, but more ram is always better with ZFS.    You may also look in to ZFS Replication for the backup up program considering you will have ZFS on both servers."
homelab,3dc4us,Catsrules,2,Wed Jul 15 04:27:04 2015 UTC,"While the topic of RAM has been covered below, I'd like to add that the amount of RAM in a ZFS system is used for the ARC, (Adaptive READ Cache) and this system will only have reads in a recover scenario.  There will be enough ARC to keep the system running, but performance will not be the greatest, and that's fine in this scenario."

homelab,3dc4us,just_insane,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:46:48 2015 UTC,"Off topic, but I'm planning on switching to proxmox in the next little bit and you seem to use the same technologies I was looking at, and was hoping you could answer some questions?  1)  how do you set up ZFS on Proxmox? I see that it is supported, but I haven't seen how to set it up  2) can Proxmox be configured as a nas with NFS/FTP/Samba shares (I have 2 3TB drives in a raid 1 for my virtualized nas on ESXI, and a data drive for guest VMs). Should I pass these drives to a CT or VM running openmediavault, or recreate with ZFS?  3) can programs such as crashplan be installed on Proxmox directly, or do they need to be run on a guest?  Thanks."
homelab,3dc4us,just_insane,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:24:48 2015 UTC,"First you should realize that Proxmox is nothing more than Debian with KVM, OpenVZ, and a custom web front end.  Once you SSH in, it's just Debian.    Proxmox VE 3.4 included the ZFSonLinux package, so you can create your zpools and datasets from the command line.  If you're new to ZFS, I'd recommend looking at this to see how easy it is to create a zpool on ZoL.    So... 1) SSH in to the server, 'zpool create data-pool raidz sdb sdc sdd sde -m /data' and you will have a raidz pool with 4 drives, and it's mounted at /data.  Seriously, it's that simple.  From there you can set sharenfs to on and it's now a nfs share.  Proxmox can actually use the zpool for VM storage as a block level device, so you don't have to share it with Proxmox over NFS.    2) No need to pass the drives to a CT/VM like that.  Just create a zfs mirror on the Proxmox server (again, it would look something like 'zpool create data-pool mirror sdb sdc -m /data').    3) Since Proxmox is just debian, yes you can install Crashplan directly on the the server (as I did).  I installed Openbox on my Proxmox server, so I can VNC in and manage Crashplan.  Alternatively, you can manage Crashplan over a ssh tunnel, but I didn't want to deal with that.  I have other reasons for wanting to use Openbox occasionally, so I went on and installed it.    Hope that helps."

homelab,3d93hr,aphaelion,4,Tue Jul 14 14:26:53 2015 UTC,"Well, Nutanix makes ""hyperconverged"" hardware that essentially has all the compute and storage resources in a single box. Their software (which is what the Community Edition is) is like a front-end for a hypervisor, similar to vSphere on ESXi. I spoke with a Nutanix representative at a VMUG UserCon recently, and apparently Nutanix works directly with KVM. If you're using a KVM hypervisor, Nutanix can actually act as vCenter Server would in an ESXi environment, maintaining HA and clustering. I haven't tried this, but it seems like it might be an awesome resource for an open-source homelab if the Community Edition has the same capability."

homelab,3d93hr,tyrant42,3,Wed Jul 15 02:47:05 2015 UTC,"Having read about Nutanix and other hyperconvered options, what is the draw? Why combine storage and compute, when they generally need to grow separately? The way I understand Nutanix is you have to add another compute node and just fill it with drives if you need more storage. Is it being treated as just another controller/appliance so you can slot in a weak compute node with a lots of disks?"

homelab,3d93hr,Anon_8675309,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:53:00 2015 UTC,"I think the main draw of Nutanix in the enterprise environment is that local attached storage is cheaper and more convenient. It is also faster when optimized by nutanix to not have the resources separated. The environment mixes flash and commodity storage for a much cheaper environment while maintaining speed.  Basically, you can scale your environment much cheaper and simpler using Nutanix. The traditional method of having a SAN and a compute cluster, the need for engineers and architects to make decisions on how to grow your cluster or your SAN is expensive and time consuming (especially when using Fiber Channel) where Nutanix takes that kind of thoughts out of the game. Need more compute? Add more nodes. Need more storage? Also add more nodes.   With products like the Dell R630 or R730XD, you can fit nearly as much storage in 2 42U racks as you could splitting up your compute and your storage, and you will come out far ahead on the compute as well. Nutanix boasts performance in line or greater than the most expensive SAN environments mixing that commodity storage and flash storage. It is worth checking out and simplifying environments.  Finally, their software handles high availability and disaster recovery in a single license for both your compute and storage. Normally you would need SAN replication + Datacenter balancing/planning but it's all figured out simply in one product. Use linux kvm, vcenter, or hyper-v products depending on which you prefer."

What you planning to run in terms of VMs?: Hyper V  Nope, not hypervisor platform-- what are you planning on running in terms of VMs? What are you doing with your lab?

Motherboard, socket type, are those dual channel RAM sticks 2x4GB or one 8GB, etc  I don't know what you're doing in your lab, so I can only make suggestions here.  A 6 core running at 3.2GHz is probably enough for most. Spin the other machine down entirely, and put as much RAM as possible into the one machine you're running.   32GB will run you ~$200.   If you're itching to burn through the additional cash, you can spend the additional $800 on a new server using a CPU with a low TDP. Basing it off intel will likely yield a less power hungry build.    PSU: Free (Keep the PSU from the AMD build if it's beefy/efficient enough) 32GB of RAM: ~$200 Motherboard: ~$100 (Look into MicroATX if you want to preserve space in that 4U) Storage: Free (Keep the storage from the AMD build) Case: Free (4U case you're reusing) Intel Processor of your choice: ~$300 (a 4.0GHz (4.4 turbo) Intel Core i7-4790K 88W TDP ran me >$300 at MicroCenter if that's an option for you)   This gives you a $600 machine that runs more efficiently than your AMD box with more speed and you get to keep the AMD box, which now has significantly more RAM and as a result, is a much more flexible server."

Setup an NFS mount with the USB disk. Mount the nfs share to ESXi and copy the data.  That's what I would do. That way it's not formating the drive as VMFS and you get a half decent back solution.

homelab,3d95cl,thatguyzcool,2,Tue Jul 14 13:54:37 2015 UTC,"Nope. Your VMs use virtual disks stored on the datastore. In the eyes of the OS, virtual disks behave just like a normal disk.

There are a lot of unanswered questions here, though. Are you storing your VMs locally on the HDDs in the PE1950, or are you using network storage and iSCSI/NFS? If you're using network storage, that makes things much easier, since you could just install ESXi from scratch on the Intel, mount the shares to it, and spin up your VMs on the new ESXi host with just a tiny bit of setup. If your VMs are stored locally, you'll want to move them to a network drive that can be accessed by the new Intel host. Long story short, just swapping HDDs from one host to another of completely different hardware/firmware types probably won't work and, if it does, it's definitely not recommended."

Is it solely for backup, instead of rebuilding bunch of vm's?"

It's best you use an external drive to back and have a second back up location to be most safe, it could be a Cloud, online, internal drive, as you decide.   I also understand you're worried that the drives you have could die, but actually that would only be natural after a few years of work. That is why you need to have back ups. So that after a few years you need to replace a drive, you'd still have the data. And the best way to back up data is at least at two other locations outside the original drive.   Cheers! :)  CK_WD"

homelab,3d6prg,clashrules,7,Mon Jul 13 23:17:48 2015 UTC,"Firstly, how are non-homelab people even supposed to saturate a 2gbps link?   AT&T didn't think the iPhone would be such a hit that it'd cripple their network for months. Quite the surprise for them, no? Google has already done the field tests, and people are able to saturate a 1Gb line, so why not a 2Gb? More bandwidth means more services, more infrastructure for innovation. The first thing that came to mind is how MS is pushing the new VR-wearables with Minecraft. Take that as a proof of concept.... what kind of VR applications could you stream if bandwidth wasn't a concern?   I'd be surprised if 0.1% of the households had routers that could route more than 500mbps of traffic.   The Geek Squad at Best Buy will be happy to sell you a router upgrade for just $200 that will be compatible with whatever your ISP, SysAdmin, Car Dealer, or local butcher requires for you to get top-level service. Speaking of service, they'll add an extended warranty for only an additional $29.99! Seriously though, modems that are DOCSIS 3.1 certified should be able to route something like 10Gb down and 1Gb up. DOCSIS is developed by the big names in networking. If Cisco and Broadcom say the modem in the box can do 10Gb down and 1Gb up, I believe them. If not, expect some trade group to sue in the future.   I'm wondering how comcast will handle us homelab people if we wanted to use our own hardware to fully use the 2g link. Or will they be intentionally be bottlenecking the service with only gigabit ports on their ""professional grade equipment"" they're installing.   Way too early to tell, but open to speculation given their past. Does it say anywhere the 2Gb is anything other than burst speed? Have to check the fine print. Like any ISP, they're going to QoS their network, so again, maybe you won't get the full 2Gb for what you're doing. Furthermore, most residential connections have stipulations in the fine print that you're not supposed to be hosting services to the outside world. They're not really enforced, but it's a card they pull if you start using a ""excessive"" amount of bandwidth. Problem is, the definition of excessive varies from ISP to ISP, and nobody really knows/says the solid numbers. When they catch you though, they're happy to try and sell you on a business class connection... one that won't violate their terms of service (or of course, they'll ask you to tone down your usage).  I like that they're doing it, I like that Google has forced Comcast, CL, and AT&T to upgrade their infrastructure to compete. I think that the ISPs are going to price it excessively high to get an immediate return on their upgrades though, and deter many people from getting the service. A more sensible approach would be to price it lower, get a higher volume of customers, and reap the long-term revenue. Instead they're going for low-volume/high-price. Current price I've seen is about $7500 including install (they factor in the 2yr contract you have to sign to get it). They'll use that as a talking point to reduce this kind of roll out to anything but select markets, stating that people ""don't want"" high speed internet. Flimsy argument, but they'll do it. If you can get the Comcast 505 connection though, apparently they're going to get a free upgrade to the 2gb connection when it arrives in their area, so different contract, probably without the 2yr buy-in, but still pricey.

I am writing a paper on consumer-level (by consumer-level I mean not running a homelab) applications that will drive the adoption of gigabit speeds, and so far the best I've found is the Mozilla Ignite challenge, which is pretty pathetic at showing the need: https://mozillaignite.org/  I dont doubt that those speeds will be needed in the future, but today, I can't see any consumer-level applications even coming close to saturating 1 Gbit, even if you take the top 10 bandwidth hungry applications and run them 24/7 under reasonable assumptions."
homelab,3d6prg,8463216,2,Tue Jul 14 12:31:58 2015 UTC,"Just a little note, often times the full speed is only supported in ""bridge"" mode, where the devices has nothing more than reframing to do. In many cases, in consumer routers, the device can indeed talk on the cable at the required speed for the spec, but won't be able to route (i.e. do the NAT for the household) at that line rate.  Here in France the only decent big name ISP actually says on their webpage that their ISP provided box can only handle 600mbps in routed mode, so if you get a 1gbps fiber link, you should use bridge mode directly to your computer or your own better router."

From everything that I've read and spoke to Comcast people about, this service will not be DOCSIS, and will be FTTH. I don't think Comcast plans to fully roll out DOCSIS 3.1 until early next year. Also, DOCSIS 3.1 can only support up to just over 1Gb upstream, and Gigabit Pro is support to be 2Gb\2Gb.  The other issue is a router that will support over 1Gb. I don't know of a consumer grade router that will support those speeds, including the one that Comcast told me they are planning on leasing with the service."
homelab,3d6prg,matthaios637,3,Tue Jul 14 17:47:00 2015 UTC,"Every single ISP out there is betting people are not using there connection to the fullest. On their side, higher marketed bandwidth means a higher revenue from people who ""need the best"" and only go to facebook. Overprovisionning to the extreme means a lot more money in their pockets.  Realistically, they probably provision their nodes with a 10G connection, and this is split to probably 500 people. That way, everyone can max out, just not at the same time.  The ISP I work for provision HFC nodes with 2.5G on average. This feeds 250 houses. Plans are 15, 30, 60, 120, 200. The bet is that no more than 5% are on 200, another 5% on 120, 10% on 60, the rest on the lower plans. This is the best way to maximize return on investment.

Speedtest tells me (right now) that I'm getting about 37d/5u from them. What it won't tell you is that their cable modem falls over about 5x a week, sometimes more often than that, in which case all of my own hardware investment means squat for reliability. Yeah, I reckon the next hardware investment should be a cable modem of my own to replace their's (and hope that the modem itself is indeed the problem)."

I'm sure that the overwhelming majority of the population doesn't have any more than a gigabit link for their desktop/laptop and same goes for wireless routers.   With multiple computers?  4 computers each pulling 500mbps will do it.   Even for 1g links, I doubt people have routers at home with the capacity to handle that much traffic   I'm pretty certain the service comes with the rental of a capable edge router to do the job."
homelab,3d6prg,SirMaster,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:27:03 2015 UTC,"I recently called Comcast to get more information. Most of there reps and even installers don't know much if anything about the service yet. When calling their sales reps, in order to even find out if it is available in your area, they have to submit a ticket to their department that deals with their Gigabit Pro service. From there, they call you back in a day or two and let you know if it is available. In my case, it wasn't available, so I don't know what the rest of the process looks like, but I did ask the guy a ton of questions about the service and pricing.   Cost will be $299/month plus $500 activation fee and $500 installation fee. Those prices may vary by location, but that is what I was quoted. Service will be fiber to the home. Although I spoke with the regular installer that installs their normal service, and he didn't think it was going to be fiber to the home, but then again, he didn't really have much or any information on it. He also told me that there are currently only two fiber installers for Comcast in my area, so I don't think they are expecting many installs at this time. Hardware at this time will be rental only, and you cannot use your own equipment. The fiber will terminate to 1 of two devices, a Juniper device or some other brand that I can't recall, but it started with an ""S"". They guy I spoke with also said he believes the router they will also be leasing is the Netgear Nighthawk. Both will cost $20/month for rental fees.   I think it will definitely be hard to saturate that much speed, but my main consideration for it would be that it is symmetrical 2Gb. Right now with their current services, you max upload at about 25Mb if you're lucky, then your entire network comes to a crawl. There really isn't any consumer grade equipment that can even utilize those speeds. I think it's more of a marketing ploy for Comcast to say they have the fastest speeds."

I'm still waiting on my callback. The first person I spoke to said I had to be in the City of Atlanta. The second person said not in my area. The third finally put the danged ticket in. Comcast spent months earlier this year messing up traffic and breaking water lines to pull fiber down the road outside my neighborhood so I'm hoping this is what that was all about."

In either case, it seems like it will take at least a month or two to get everything installed and setup if you are in an eligible area. It sounds like most areas only have a few licensed and qualified technicians that can run and install fiber.  I thought it was funny how barely any of their own employees  have heard of the service. The first guy I spoke with on the online chat insisted that it doesn't exist and kept saying Megabytes and Gigabytes even after i said Gigabit.

homelab,3d6prg,matthaios637,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:22:41 2015 UTC,"I guess Comcast should have stopped offering higher speeds once everyone's WRT-54Gs stopped being fast enough. 24Mb/s ought to be enough for anyone, right?  Of course this is all about Comcast wanting to have market-leading speeds without having to compete on price. Getting 2Gb/s to your endpoints is rightfully your problem, not Comcast's. Be grateful that leasing some too-expensive, Comcast-controlled router with many 10GbE ports isn't part of the deal.  pfsense probably isn't the way to go for multi-gigabit routing, Linux has been at this much longer. Here's a 2009 presentation showing 32Gb/s routing performance on an i7-920. Here's a 2010 presentation showing 93Gb/s routing on 2x E5530.

My next step is to get into Ansible and use that to add new subdomains programatically when I setup a new container for some app on my proxmox box. =)  So far I have: owncloud, couchpotato, guacamole, librenms, phpmyadmin, proxmox, sabnzbd, sonarr, subsonic, transmission, and zabbix.

Mostly to make it easier to manage permissions, shared folders, etc. I often spin up Windows machines to test something out, and I find it much easier to have them join the domain and pull a set of policies defined by Group Policy (password setup, firewall settings, shared folders).   My Raspberry Pi running Raspibian is also domain joined. Much easier to copy code across (I use Visual Studio and deploy to the Pi).  I use DHCP and DNS from active directory and that makes it much easier to connect to stuff.. don't need to worry about IPs.  I also run Jira and Confluence at home, and my wife and I use that for  project planning (where project = vacation, home stuff, etc). It's much easier to centralize credentials and have her just use one password that changes when she changes it.  I'm licensed via MSDN.  Things to be careful about:   If you run a domain, you have to make sure your domain controller stays up. If it dies, bad things will happen.  See point 1   I have a Backup DC running on the same VM host as the primary (both run on my QNAP NAS). In addition to that, I run a site-to-site VPN to Azure, and have a third DC running there in case my NAS goes down.

The most common firmware is DD-WRT, as this firmware tends to be compatible with most routers. Tomato and PfSense are also different router firmwares that you can use so long as they are compatible. Here is a list of routers compatible with each of the firmware types that you can use to determine which router will suit your needs based on the firmware you want to use when you purchase a new router.   DD-WRT -- http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Supported_Devices -- Tomato -- http://tomatousb.org/doc:build-types Pfsense -- http://www.pfsense.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=44&Itemid=50  Since your looking for a new router, there is one company that currently offers a Preconfigured router for our service. I've provided the link for you below.  http://www.flashrouters.com/routers/vpn-types/privateinternetacess?acc=45c48cce2e2d7fbdea1afc51c7c6ad26  Please note these routers are not ours, nor is the firmware (they merely set them up with our settings before shipping them out). Private Internet Access does not directly endorse this product, and use of it is at your own discretion and liability. Also, please note that no service is included with the router's purchase; the cost is only for the router itself, which is not directly purchased through us; it's created, setup, and made available via a company called FlashRouters (they setup common VPN settings on their routers for different companies, then ship them out to customers).  This router comes semi-configured and you will still need to update the date/time settings to the local area.  It is configured so that you only have to enter their gateway server, and username/pass to use the service.

homelab,3d35vs,Vino84,2,Mon Jul 13 03:48:10 2015 UTC,"Thoughts: Since you are dealing with only one HyperV host, you could just map the drives directly to the ""Storage VM"", then carve them up according to your testing needs. I don't think you ""need"" two switches.  Setting up two switches, and assigning them to two different network interfaces, will optimize utilization, but not in a significant way at this level of build IMHO."
homelab,3d35vs,honer123,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:42:46 2015 UTC,"Cheers for that!  I was thinking the 2 NICs as that would fall in line with ""best practices"" on iSCSI from what I understand. It is all IP traffic though, so I guess it doesn't matter. However, with the IOPS in this instance, I wouldn't see any significant gains from it at the end of the day.  I would also have to set up an internal DNS zone to use iSCSI as well, wouldn't I? From what I've seen, the initiator uses the FQDN of the iSCSI target to resolve it. I could use host entries until I have a DNS zone configured though.  In your opinion, would I be better off attaching the iSCSI storage to the Host and placing VHDX files on top of it, or presenting it directly to the VM? If the former, I believe that I would be better off presenting the varying RAID levels back as different targets. If the latter, I will need to carve up the storage using LVM then present it to the VM Scratch that, did some reading. Attach to the host and put VHDX files on top of that.  So, I present the raw disks to the Storage VM, use mdadm & LVM to do what I need to, and then present the resulting volumes as iSCSI targets to the Host, which I then put the VHDX files on to. Correct?  Sorry for the rambling post"

homelab,3d1v1w,EpiJunkie,3,Sun Jul 12 21:45:53 2015 UTC,"I would add a 5th host as /u/mautobu suggested and run Nginx as the reverse proxy. You would point ports 80 and 443 to the fifth host.  This guide should get your started, the guide does add a layer of complication because it will load balance between multiple instances of your wordpress/owncloud/forum applications. But because you are not doing that you can simply leave the VM's one ip in the upstream section. The only addendum to this guide is you would add another section for each subdomain/application you are running. Then change each sections' ""server_name"" line to the appropriate subdomain.  Here is a crude example of how a reverse proxy works:   A request from Interwebs-Guest comes in for wordpress.dgaa1991.com on your Public IP pfSense forwards that port to Nginx on VM5 Nginx sees that it is a http/https request for wordpress.dgaa1991.com   Based on the Nginx configuration, it see that it needs to forward that request to wordpress-server.local which is running Apache While doing that, Nginx will change the headers so that it appears that Interweb-Guest made the request directly  Apache gets the request from Nginx, even though the headers appear that it came from Interweb-Guest Apache responds to Nginx Nginx forwards it's response that it got from Apache to Interweb-Guest   With the guide above the next request would round-robin to wordpress-server2.local."
homelab,3d1v1w,EpiJunkie,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:46:52 2015 UTC,can i ask what advantages there is with Nginx compared to Squid3?  it is because my Xenserver is going to have   16 GB DDR3 ECC 1666 Ghz Xeon E3-1240L V3   So it is a low powered server i have running and i think it would be better to use some of the Pfsense's CPU power and Ram instead
homelab,3d1v1w,EpiJunkie,2,Sun Jul 12 22:17:26 2015 UTC,"For me, Nginx is easier to understand and configure. Also my preference would be to run services separately from my firewall. I prefer my firewall not to be handling external http/https request.   While pfSense does support third party packages to be installed, they are not as simple as pkg install nginx or yum install nginx or apt-get install nginx; those third party packages are massaged into place to work on the pfSense platform which is a little different then say your CentOS/Ubuntu instances, in that much of the pfSense  filesystem is readonly. My point is, you'll be able to keep a more up to date system for your reverse-proxy and you let pfSense do what it does best route and block packets."

It's not that joining it to the domain ~causes~ problems. It's that joining it to the domain makes any problem you DO have dramatically harder to fix. Again, unless you are willing to blow your entire domain structure away if something happens, just don't do it.

I'm used to working only with the procurve CLI, but all I've ever had to do is turn on ip routing, define my VLANs, and point a single static route to my pfSense box (0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 <pfSense IP>).  Then on pfSense go to System > Routing and create a Gateway (<name>, LAN, <SwitchIP>, <SwitchIP>, Description> and a Route for each VLAN.  This gets VLAN routing setup and working at a basic level.  One thing that people forget often when they implement this for the first time is to put the IP address you gave the VLAN on the switch as your client's gateway.  You don't need any additional config on the client other than IP, netmask, and gateway.  Once the machine works well at a basic level, then you can start doing crazy advanced things if needed."

homelab,3d0q56,dxm765,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:46:00 2015 UTC,"One thing you can do is look at doing ReFS (if dedupe isn't a concern) to help alleviate immediate loss concerns, then use Storage Spaces to ensure the parity is taken care of. By doing this, if you have a hardware failure, any other Storage Spaces machine can read it (that's preferential to a raid card in which you may need to find an exact model match to read your data).   If you acquire more hardware, you can cluster that, then you have 2 live sets of data. Personally, I'd only do that for the OS/VMs, then have nightly backups to a third place for storage (doesn't take much hardware to grab a nightly backup, especially once the initial one is captured).   In this method, you have HA, backups, and a robust system. Yes, it's expensive. For that reason, I'm building mine out to have the cluster be last. All VMs are on RAID 10 SSDs, and ESX is on an SD card. That gets backed up to my storage spaces server, then from there I do periodic dumps of the backups to extra disks and take them elsewhere."

In your case, I'd absolutely look at a portable AC unit -- with all of that on, you're going to get toasty. I'd think that or a small nice looking window unit, but either way you're going to want some cooling.  To put it in perspective, I've got a DL380G6, an old Lenovo desktop (K210 -- core2 Quad based) running my NAS/NFS storage, my laptop (W520), an SRW2048 switch,  and a pfsense box (dual core HT Atom). With all of that plus the modem and WAP going, it's fine for my needs. Realistically, a single extra server would make me seriously consider getting proper AC."
homelab,3cxyvz,cquick97,2,Sat Jul 11 20:00:54 2015 UTC,"I really like Puppet/Foreman, I probably use it in it's most basic form in my homelab. I use Gitlab to manage all my manifests and config files, IE SNMP, rsyslog, collectd and nginx virtual host configs.   All my manifests could easily be converted to bash scripts, as I don't ustilise any puppet modules apart from NTP. Instead I just issue raw commands VIA puppet.   I don't host any files config files on the Puppet server, instead I just call them with wget and use the raw link from Gitlab.   I have a simple shell script which does the puppet agent install and configuration, so all I have to do is run the script and then sign the client cert on my Puppet master.   With this setup I can get a new server provisioned and added to my monitoring stack in less than 5 minutes VS 15 - 20 minutes doing it maually.   Puppet is fairly easy to learn and very easy to manage with Foreman, Digitalocean have some great tutorials on Puppet and how to create manifests from scratch. Those are the only ones I read to learn puppet, after an hour I had my first manifest written."
homelab,3cxyvz,buildsrc,2,Sat Jul 11 23:34:06 2015 UTC,"I recommend Ansible too. Easy to set up, easy to learn. I manage updates, security settings, user access, and more with it on a bunch of systems at work."
homelab,3cxyvz,Vlinux,2,Sun Jul 12 05:10:28 2015 UTC,"I also would recommend Ansible if you want to get down & dirty quickly. I also think Docker somewhat solves this problem as well. Puppet is the most verbose of the stated solutions, Chef less so. I've never used Salt.  It all comes down to personal preference. Reading the comments Ansible or Salt. Or Docker, if that floats your boat."
homelab,3cxyvz,alrayyes,5,Sun Jul 12 12:18:28 2015 UTC,"I'm a really big fan of Salt, I use Salt at home and at work. It's easy to pickup, extremely powerful when needed and is in my opinion nicer to work with then Chef/Puppet.  With salt you have 2 main ways of managing systems, orchestration and states, with orchestration you could update openssl on all your machines with one command from the master: salt '*' pkg.install openssl, with a state you would have something like:  openssl:     pkg.latest   In a state file which yo target to a mcahine (or bunch of machines) and then you'd run a highstate to get everything up to date.  From your post I'm guessing you don't have much experience running a CM system, I made a blogpost about setting up a development environment for salt with Vagrant and LXC which gives you a fully working nginx/haproxy example which might be of help if you're just starting out with Salt/CM; if not the getting started docs for Salt are pretty good."
homelab,3cxyvz,deadbunny,2,Sat Jul 11 20:20:18 2015 UTC,I also use Salt and love it. Only takes a few min to rebuild a VM with it. I keep all my salt formulas and pillars in git repos on my Stash VM as well.

homelab,3cxyvz,canhazraid,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:34:57 2015 UTC,I first tried out Ansible but I don't get the whole playbooks thing. Can you explain them to me? I sorta like the idea of just using SSH.
homelab,3cxyvz,canhazraid,2,Sun Jul 12 00:57:47 2015 UTC,"ansible-playbook executes a PLAYBOOK against a list of HOSTS.  A playbook in its most simple form is a list of tasks.  Tasks are either shell commands, or modules that come with Ansible (create users, manage files, etc).  You can also use 'roles' to have more complex config.  In a general use case, you define both.  ansible-playbook my-first-playbook.yml   A hosts file (/etc/ansible/hosts) might look like:   [lab:children]  web  database   [lab:play]  plex   [web]  192.168.10.10  192.168.10.11   [database]  192.168.10.12   [plex]  192.168.10.13   From your playbook, you can now target individual hosts, host groups, or groupings of groups.  You also get 'all' which incluedes all listed hosts.   - hosts: all    tasks:    - name: Add Management User      user: name=cquick97 password=<cryptedpassword>   - hosts: plex    roles:    - { role: plex-ansible }  # download   https://github.com/kylejohnson/plex-ansible   - hosts: web    roles:    - {role: ansible-role-apache }  # https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-apache   of course, you dont need to use roles.  A playbook can be a series of simlpe commands as well.     tasks:  – name: install apache2  action: apt pkg=apache2 state=latest"
homelab,3cxyvz,htomeht,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:16:41 2015 UTC,Should every server that I am controlling have the same password and the ability to use sudo without inputting a password in order to maximize the efficiency and ease of Ansible?
homelab,3cxyvz,deadbunny,4,Sun Jul 12 02:02:59 2015 UTC,"There are a number of ways to handle that.  You can load a certificate to each machine for a user with sudo access.  You can login as a common root password.  You can login as a common user password.  You can use different user/passwords for each machine  You can have different keys for each server.  Generally speaking, its easiest to have a common password for a management account or a cert."
homelab,3cxyvz,canhazraid,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:10:27 2015 UTC,At my company we have a playbook that loads a sudo user onto the host if it hasn't already been kickstarted with the correct certificates already. Works brilliantly.
homelab,3cxyvz,deadbunny,0,Sun Jul 12 12:03:01 2015 UTC,"I would say that is disingenuous, getting a Salt master setup is as easy as apt-get installing it then the minions you install, change the ip/dns name of the master in the config then restart it, then pop onto the master to accept the key, maybe 5 commands? So about the same as spinning up a new machine and setting up SSH keys/user for Ansible.  The same could be said about Salt states, Salt config management is just YAML (and jinja when you need it), to setup nginx for example is:  nginx:   pkg:    - latest   service:     - running     - enable: True  /etc/nginx/sites-available/mysite.conf:   file.managed:     - source: salt://nginx/mysite.conf     - user: root     - group: root     - mode: 655     - require_in:       - service: nginx     - watch_in:       - service: nginx   That gives you a nginx server which reloads any time the config changes, granted Ansible would be fairly comparable but I would argue Salt is just as quick to develop with (and a little nicer to read than Ansible)."
homelab,3cxyvz,robohoe,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:54:05 2015 UTC,"I would say that is disingenuous    To which of my two assertions?   Ansible is one command.  No need for SSH keys.  No need for an Ansible user.  You can add them if you want, but for a small home lab, or a quick and dirty setup -- its one command.  You don't need to even install a systemwide package.    That is certainly easier than setting up a client/server system.  Shit, you can even call ansible-playbook directly and not even maintain a hosts file or a playbook.  The config file is extremely similar tough.  Almost identical except for the verbs.  Why do you need 'watch' and 'require'?  They seem like one would provide the other.  What does development look like  With Ansible, it is easy to almost type something you think will work, toss it into a playbook, see what happened.  Hand edit the config file, run your playbook with that change as well.  Makes it quick for unsupported (ie, cant just download it) packages.   What does this cycle look like for Salt?  What does testing look like  Say you change a 'state', how do you model what that change will look like across all your servers?"
homelab,3cxyvz,hxrsmurf,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:27:53 2015 UTC,"Do you not need a user/ssh key setup for Ansible to be able to connect to the target? Salt SSH works in a very similar way to Ansible from what I can tell and if you want ease of use you'll need keys setup at a minimum.  My argument is that setting up a salt minion is barely any extra work than sorting out keys. Yes it means you have an agent on the system but the value you get from that agent is huge IMHO (having a message bus across your entire infrastructure is extremely useful).  I use Vagrant for Salt development with a simple master/slave(s) setup, my local salt states are shared with the vagrant saltmaster  so as soon as I save in my editor they are on the vagrant master available for running. Yes it's a slightly more complicated setup initially (getting the vagrant setup working, maybe 20 mins if you've got an idea of what you need to do) but you only need to do that once, but from there I would say development of salt states is just as simple at that point.  Testing can be done a few ways with salt, you can run your states with test=true which will do a dry run but this has the least value to me I've found so this is why I use the vagrant setup I mentioned previously, I can do full run as if they were on production machines but using disposable dev machines, for our states at work we've implemented full regression testing with jenkins/salt/vagrant so everything gets tested before it gets anywhere near production, you could easily do the same with Ansible/Puppet/Chef though though, that is one place where salt does fall behind is that there are no good testing frameworks.  Obviously everyone has different requirements for their infrastructure, for me the benefits of having the minion on everything far outweigh any negatives of setting them up (salt-cloud goes a long way to addressing this as it'll fully bootstrap minions and authenticate them with the master). Salt may be overkill for a homelab compared to Ansible if you just want config management but as I use Salt at work it's beneficial to me to use it at home as I can play with new features or try new things easily."

homelab,3cwvry,canhazraid,0,Sun Jul 12 00:49:53 2015 UTC,What are you using to measure power draw?  50 watts seems insanely low -- I would expect 40GB of ram to draw 25 watts on its own.
homelab,3cwvry,justasysadmin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:23:16 2015 UTC,"Just took some fresh readings just to double check.   I have my c6100 with three nodes plugged into a killawatt. I leave the 2nd power supply unplugged so I can get a total draw measurement. When I measure the power draw with one node running it shows 95-120w depending on load. When I power on each additional node the draw increases by 50w or so. The 40GB of ram is made up of 2x16GB and 2x4GB Sticks so I imagine that helps a lot there.  Sorry if I was misleading with the 50w draw claim, I should've elaborated a bit more on that."
homelab,3cwvry,canhazraid,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:46:10 2015 UTC,"That's still pretty incredible.  I assume both nodes have an IPMI controller that is taking 10-15 watts, so your 95 watt is probably 50 watts for one node, 30 watts for the IPMI controllers on both nodes, and 15 watts for the powersupply fan, DC to DC converter, etc."
homelab,3cwvry,justasysadmin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:54:26 2015 UTC,interesting. I never considered the IPMI controllers taking that much power. I just tested by physically pulling the other two nodes and my draw ranged from 84-105w instead of 95-120. Might be worth it to leave them unplugged when I don't need them.

They are low power, cheap to purchase and run, and much quieter than an identical machine with X5680s. Depending on what you intend to run, you will probably have enough CPU capacity.  Disk IO is the biggest limiting factor in my experience when virtualizing. Or rather a saturated disk causes the most noticeable latency when ""just using it"". As opposed to a situation where the machine is transcoding 4x videos and is ""slow""; your expectation is more willing to accept latency in that situation, when a machine is being taxed in a way that is easier to comprehend.

This is with one 502 watt PSU attached, a 80Plus Gold rated one. If another PSU is added about ~15watts additional watts will be drawn.

homelab,3cwmp0,adamjs83,2,Sat Jul 11 13:05:41 2015 UTC,For the camera system look at Hikvision cameras and synology surveillance station or blue iris for the NVR. You can get a Poe switch or use any switch with a passive poe injector you can find on Amazon or EBay.   As far as the alarm system you can use any Ademco or DSC alarm panel with your choice of sensors and an evisalink 3 to access it over the Internet.    If you want to get really fancy you can link the envisalink and blue iris to a home controller like the Vera edge.

The closest I can ind retail is this one.  The network rack is not attached and is actually just a spare full rack that someone had cut down to a 1/3rd rack and they were going to throw it away, so I snagged it in prep for this setup.  The switch is a Netgear ProSAFE JGS524E unmangaed smart switch. It's as close to being a managed switch as you can get without paying for a managed switch. I absolutely love it. The software that you get from the website to manage it is very simple to use and setup.  The top server is indeed a Dell Poweredge 2950, 2xXeon 5150's and 32GB DDR2 ECC with 6 physical drives setup as 3 logical disks:   2x250GB in raid1(datastore1) 2x300GB in raid1(datastore2) 2x300GB in raid1(datastore3)   I have ESXI 5.5 installed on datastore1, and the 1 VM I was able to get setup last night before passing out was on datastore2. I'm going to segregate the VM's by job, so my working VM's will be on datastore2, while my play or test VM's will be on datastore3.  The bottom machine is my NAS. I currently have freenas running on it with Q6600 and 8GB DDR2(Yes, I know I need more RAM, but I have to wait until I can replace the current stuff to get more). I have 4 HDD in it, 3x3tb and 1x2TB plus a 60GB SSD for boot. I have one jail with Plex setup to serve media throughout the house (another reason for the wired networking).  Between everything we have 1x Uverse DVR, 4x laptops, 2x Xbox 360's, 4x smartphones, 1x gaming computer, and at any given time any other number of wireless devices. So far everything plays nice with everything else, even when pushing multiple 1080p rips across the network and watching HD channels on Uverse."

I would stay away from static IPs, it's really nice to have DHCP configure everything for you and updates are dynamic (ntp, dns, dns search suffixes), though you could do the same with puppet modules. In the end, i guess DHCP only gives us a better idea of how many IPs are left and which are allocated.  Right now I'm working with a buddy on setting up a DHCP relay on his core router, same as mine, so he can use windows DHCP and DNS for certain VLANs, the one's which have machines bound to AD."

homelab,3cr17d,gstuartj,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:36:38 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but why make it more complex?  Especially in a home lab.  If you're learning, that's one thing, and don't let me stop you.  :-)  With a token, you have to take the time to manually type one in every time it connects.  Reconnects too.  With a certificate it's as easy as double-clicking a shortcut, or just having it connect at launch.  Chances of brute force even with a simple password are essentially zero.  Mathematically, certificates offer brute force protection of several orders of magnitude above what tokens can offer, and from a SecOPS perspective, a determined attacker will have a much easier time intercepting an SMS token than factoring the two enormous primes in your certificate.  People don't generally like certificates because, well, they're a little difficult to get your head around at first glance both mathematically and from an implementation standpoint.  Tokens are a lot more easy for the average person to understand, so they go the token route out of convenience.  Plus, certificates have BIG SCARY numbers inside them like 1.2.840.113549.1.1.5 and it makes it look scary just like IPv6, so stay away!  /s"
homelab,3cr17d,bfume,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:45:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, tokens don't serve the same purpose as certs and aren't meant to be replacements. Tokens verify the user, certs verify the device. My VPN server uses certs+OTP for authentication.   With a token, you have to take the time to manually type one in every time it connects. Reconnects too. With a certificate it's as easy as double-clicking a shortcut, or just having it connect at launch.   That's not ideal 2-factor authentication since both secrets live on the client machine. You're supposed to have to manually confirm user identity (ideally with a third-party device) for effective 2FA. Under your config anyone with access to your phone/laptop will have network access, or can steal your cert/password and have ongoing access. Using tokens they'd also need whatever OTP device you're using to gain access. The inconvenience is where its strength lies.  If you're using certs+password and don't have the password recorded somewhere then it's a bit closer to true 2-factor auth, but still isn't an ideal implementation since it involves two secrets you know (password and cert) but nothing you as a user physically have. (third-party OTP device/app)"
homelab,3cr17d,gstuartj,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:49:34 2015 UTC,"Pick two:  Something you know, something you have, something you are.  Yes, yes, have & know can kinda be condensed into the same thing, but that's the CISSP trifecta at least.  So with my certificate setup:   What I know is the password to the encrypted device (you do have full-disk encryption enabled everywhere, right? :-) ).  It won't boot unless I can prove I know the password.  I also know my username & password to the remote access service, and I know the password that protects the private key in my certificate.  Only the first ""know"" here is important as you'll see. What I have is a certificate.  Because of the way the certificate is issued and managed, I claim sole ownership of the certificate.  No one else anywhere has my certificate, and if they do get their hands on it, that means it must not be on my machine, and that means that it's password protected with the same crazy-strong password I use to decrypt and boot my machine, and that means they don't actually have my certificate.  Unlike the ""real"" world where ""have"" = ""physical possession,"" in our world, if you can't use a certificate, you don't have it. If I am allowed to by policy, and I choose to move my certificate to a second, third, or 39th machine, I'm still the only one that knows the password to the private key, and therefore, I'm still the only one that has the certificate.   Logically, connecting my laptop to my VPN with a certificate that's tied to my hardware is no different than your scenario where you connect to a remote system with the same smartphone that receives or provides/calculates the tokencode.  It's very important to note that this works because of the way I have my MacBook and iPad and iPhone set up in this system.  If I didn't have my devices fully encrypted, well, certificate auto-login wouldn't be secure because the private key's passphrase would necessarily be somewhere on the same machine.    If I had ""untrusted"" users on the same VPN -- and by ""untrusted"" I mean anyone other than me, even if they're family or they work for me -- I'd also do other stuff to ensure the integrity of the remote connections...  but I'm hungry now and it's lunchtime.  What do you think?  Do my arguments make sense?"

Only the first ""know"" here is important as you'll see.   All of those secrets live unencrypted on the client device while in use (at least temporarily) and can be stolen via remote hacking, malware, or physical access to the device. The advantage of 2FA with something like OTP tokens is it provides physical compartmentalization of one last secret so that even if all of your secrets are stolen from your client machine the attacker still can't get in, giving you time to change secrets. OTP devices can be physically stolen, but that requires intimate physical access, isn't as stealthy as copying a file, and it gives you warning to disable the affected account until its OTP params are reseeded.   Logically, connecting my laptop to my VPN with a certificate that's tied to my hardware is no different than your scenario where you connect to a remote system with the same smartphone that receives or provides/calculates the tokencode.   While true, that wouldn't be the proper way to use 2FA so it's a moot point. True 2FA in this scenario requires three devices: server, client, OTP device. I have a hardware token (YubiKey), which is ideal, but a scenario involving the use of a smartphone app as OTP device for a computer/iPad client would still maintain the physical separation that strong 2FA requires, as long as that smartphone is never used as a client.   It's very important to note that this works because of the way I have my MacBook and iPad and iPhone set up in this system. If I didn't have my devices fully encrypted, well, certificate auto-login wouldn't be secure because the private key's passphrase would necessarily be somewhere on the same machine.    It's also important to note that it only works assuming that: a.) You're never targeted or hacked, you never get malware and b.) You always fully power off your devices when unattended. Not on standby, not locked, but completely powered off. An OTP token scheme wouldn't have these weaknesses.  Don't get me wrong, I think your setup is perfectly fine and is better than average. It's a great way to handle the compromise between security and the convenience of auto-connection. I'm just trying to point out that a password+cert combo doesn't technically address all of the weaknesses 2FA is intended to address."

You would then forward the ports you need to have the OpenVPN service accessable by hosts from the Internet, and then you should be able to remotely participate in your home network.

Right, so I used to use SSH, and just port forward that to my internal network for things I want to access... but now I do it like this:  My remote server (Dedicated hardware/Colocated) I use OpenVPN to access, then one of my routers at home use a session to it as well, so it sort of ties the 'me on the outside' with the 'me on the inside'.   My phone, and Laptop (only portable devices I have that can do VPN/would ever need to) have the OpenVPN client and my configurations with their own keys.   It's so good being able to use public WiFi etc, and just tap one button to tunnel myself out to somewhere I trust, with the other machines I trust or need to jump to in that little loop with me.    To pull this off, I use OpenVPN's server on port 443 with SSH and HTTPS/(SSL) using a software package called SSLH. A multiplexer software that can differentiate between SSH, SSL and OpenVPN connections.   Close to nowhere blocks 443 so it's worked every time for me thus far.

Does the transfer take as long if you were to use an ethernet cable to your laptop rather than wi-fi?  What do you mean partitioning a drive? You created a virtual disk to install windows on didn't you? With ESXi/vCenter creating a VM and installing windows should take ~20mins?
homelab,3cqmun,birdy9221,2,Fri Jul 10 00:16:24 2015 UTC,"Gigabit port, can try connecting my laptop directly and jperf it to see the full throughput.   I created the VM, gave it 500GB (keeping media  ""local"" to the VM for the Plex app) and then installed Windows.  Shrank the drive to 100GB as my OS drive, then formatted the second partition.  First time around tried to do the partitioning in the Windows Installer and it screwed up pretty bad.  Windows installed on the larger of the two (maybe I marked the wrong one active) but when I went to shrink the primary to create free space for the secondary it wouldn't allow me to add that free space.  It was late and I was tired of messing with it so I just blew it out and re-did it.  That's when it hung on 27% formatting through the night and required a restart/reformat on that second partition to finally sort out.    I used to support Windows Servers back in '08 so my Windows-Fu probably isn't top notch.  :(  The problems I am running into very much feel like an I/O problem with the drives but I have no knowledge of how to test that.

I did this because my switch (TL-SG1016DE) doesn't appear to support dynamic link aggregation. On the switch, I created a trunk group for those 4 ports. The synology gets a single IP and reports a 4000Mbps connection.  I assumed I could just do something like that on the ESXi host and call it a day. =)   After a bit more reading, I think what I've been doing is not really LACP afterall.

Disclaimer: I'm the Xen Orchestra project leader, that's why I will only talk about the Free and Open Source version (aGPLv3), which have ALL the features available on GitHub. And this is precisely the version fitted for people building a homelab here :)  First, XenServer:   Open Source since 2013 Embed everything in a simple installation, no need to configure/install Xen, it works out of the box Powerful features (see below) A very powerful API, with an extensive documentation   Here is some feature I love with XenServer:   Xen Storage Motion: migrate a live VM to another host without any shared storage to another host VDI live migration: if you change your NAS/SAN or local storage, you can migrate the storage disk of the VM in live. That's very convenient when you decide to rebuild your homelab SAN or change your NFS target. Live resource adaptation: you can raise/shrink the vCPUs number or RAM on a live VM.   And all of this for free!  Then, as a user of my own software, why I love Xen Orchestra (I admit it's biased, but as a sysadmin I assure you it's very useful):   Administrate everything from any OS without installation (web based tool). Also works from a tablet/phone with the help of responsive design. Drag n' drop for Live Migration Expose a lot of awesome feature of XenServer Add features on the top of it, like scheduling rolling snapshots or exports for backup purpose Delegate resources (VMs) for my dev team, connected to our Open LDAP server   And that's also totally free (and Open Source). No licence etc.  If you are a company and you need support + a virtual appliance with the product already installed (and working in 1 minute), that's another story, which I think is not relevant here.  If you want more input on XenServer (or Xen Orchestra), I'll be happy to contribute!  P.S: my current small lab setup: http://imgur.com/O36e8pl   3x XenServer with basic miniITX 1150 boards, 4GB RAM and various CPUs (1x Core i5, 1x Pentium and 1x Celeron) and 60GB Intel SSDs -> those are the 3 boxes on the right 1x Debian with basic miniITX 1150 board + IBM 1015 card and 6x 500GB HDDs, exposed all the Mdadm RAID10 stuff in iSCSI to the 3 XenServers -> this bigger box on the left   I can make a lot of tests on this lab and it's rock stable despite the ""small"" cost and noise."

I see the XOA is like that but a manual install doesn't really say. I use VM imports in my homelab as well as migration.   Edit: I meant XOA, not OVA"
homelab,3cm1hb,Cow-Tipper,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:06:20 2015 UTC,"You have everything in term of Xen Orchestra features (even ""Premium"" features when it's out!)  XOA (appliance) is easier to install and have an integrated updater + corporate support, so it makes sense for companies using it in production.  edit: for a company, XOA cost is negligible, compared to the admin time to install and update it from GitHub manually. For a home lab that's not the same story ;)"
homelab,3cm1hb,Plam503711,2,Thu Jul 9 13:16:42 2015 UTC,Sweet!  I might give this a try. Proxmox works well but I am ready to change things up.   Do you know if there are any issues running it nested so I can give it a try?
homelab,3cm1hb,Cow-Tipper,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:19:22 2015 UTC,"I'm no Proxmox expert, but give it a try.

homelab,3cm1hb,Cow-Tipper,2,Thu Jul 9 13:34:39 2015 UTC,You have everything in term of Xen Orchestra features   So the Xen Orchestra Appliance is the only thing that falls under the pricing tiers on the website?
homelab,3cm1hb,nswizdum,2,Fri Jul 10 16:02:37 2015 UTC,"Pricing tiers are for:   XOA (i.e XO working instantly) Corporate support Web updater, allowing to upgrade a Free to any other version + update XOA to the latest version automatically (which is tied up with our database to count when a version expires etc. That's why it's only in XOA)   I hope it's more clear now :) (we'll make efforts to be easier to understand)  Xen Orchestra itself is totally Open Source (aGPLv3).  We believe there is two type of users:   corporate users/customers, who want to have something working out of the box, without doing anything else than clicking on button in the web interface. And with the objective of ""everything works instantly"" and if not, having someone available to help them, almost immediately. community users: have some time to install it and upgrade it. But because we don't have any control of the environment, we can't provide any corporate support, nor a proper upgrader."

homelab,3cm1hb,nswizdum,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:10:13 2015 UTC,"Sadly, if we want to live on this project, we can't do otherwise :( Furthermore, our pricing stays the same even if your infrastructure grows. But I understand it's hard to convince management for something useful and not that expensive (I saw public schools paying very expensive IT stuff without a question because ""if the price is that high, the product should be good"").  My advice: you can always use the product from the sources if you (your school) can't afford it :) I'll be happy to help you as far as I can through our forums!"

Like how you can ""cluster"" vmware hosts as one big pool and vcenter can automagically vmotion to adjust loads or protect for a failing host.  I don't know Xenserver beyond it's a competitor to vmware and other bare metal 'visors.  Appreciate the info.  Edit: Having the project lead for an enterprise product helping out the masses on reddit speaks volumes to the culture behind the product.  Kudos."

For sure, it will be available on GitHub.  About helping the ""masses"": we deeply believe in Open Source, so we believe in the community as well :)"

homelab,3cm1hb,oldspiceland,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:58:38 2015 UTC,I hate running games under wine. Specially sc2 and hots where the lower framerate is just not acceptable. I really want a native battlenet client.
homelab,3cm1hb,oldspiceland,2,Thu Jul 9 23:09:22 2015 UTC,"I hated XenServer when I was managing 5k XenDesktop instances on an 8-node XenServer cluster.  The Cluster was so finicky, and I was scared to apply updates.  The 6 rounds of updates I did on that cluster, not once did all 8 go flawlessly.  Either some patches would fail to apply, or it would kill a host.  Reboots are scary too, because you never know if they will come back up.    The real test (for me) that proved I hated it, was imaging 12 different physical lab servers (all were the same model and specs), using the exact same CD, and getting different results.  It was weird, and I just moved on from it.    I'll be honest though, I've never cared a lot for VMware.  Heck, I prefer Hyper-V on Server 2012 to VMware 5 or newer.  But, I run Proxmox at home, and really like that.    At work we have a VMware cluster, but mostly we run vanilla KVM with OpenStack."

homelab,3cm1hb,iRawrz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:41:48 2015 UTC,Clustering in Proxmox was always pretty great. Granted we ran very small clusters.. but it worked well.
homelab,3cm1hb,iRawrz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:09:06 2015 UTC,"I have never had a patch update fail or go wonky. Course I'm not running that many instances. I have physical serves, 8 VM's on them and applying to master works flawlessly which of course then applies to the children. It also depends on the version you had and the maturity of the product. From 6.0 to 6.5 now is a huge leap ahead."
homelab,3cm1hb,justasysadmin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:00:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was dealing with XS 6.0 back then, before it went open source.  I hear 6.5 is a big improvement, but I already have a sour taste from that experience.  If it's working great for you, then that's awesome!    The other problem I have with XenServer is the lack of a good webUI.  Xen Orchestrator looks cool, but it's closed source (I think).  There was another tool out there, but I think that project is pretty well dead.  Proxmox's focus on management is via webUI, which works great for me."
homelab,3cm1hb,boblmartens,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:47:10 2015 UTC,"If you read through this thread the dev for Xen Orchestra is here and has pointed towards his tool, it is opensource. I never use the webGUI the Xencenter is free to use and is amazing so thats what I use."

Citrix XenCenter isn't available on anything but Windows, and I don't run Windows.  There is also OpenXenManager, but I hop around to devices so much, I can't rely on having a console installed on every box I might log into.  Thus, I prefer web UI's."
homelab,3cm1hb,boblmartens,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:56:27 2015 UTC,"I like XenServer...except for the fact that you have to update each update manually from the command line unless you pay them.  That turned me off pretty badly.  [EDIT:] Apparently they've ""fixed"" that, but to be honest it still left me with a bad taste in my mouth. That plus the fact that I just generally find it far more cumbersome than VMWare for doing the stuff I enjoy doing means even with the change I won't be going back."
homelab,3cm1hb,Pr4Bem9WrFXx3cMQ,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:23:45 2015 UTC,I don't understand why people complain about the command line..  it usually becomes a copy and paste session for upgrades unless something bad happens. But I like me some CLI
homelab,3cm1hb,ntba,2,Thu Jul 9 22:13:34 2015 UTC,"Because it was tremendously tedious and an absolute paywall? To not spend tedious amounts of time updating new servers from the original install media was simply too much for me. It offered me literally nothing in return for that either. I love CLI, I started out as a Cisco guy, learned bash when I started playing with Linux, and I'm learning PowerShell now that I deal with 99% windows. I definitely don't have an aversion to CLI, just to shitty paywalls that soak up my time with no technical reason or benefit.  Like I said though, I like it, it's a good product, especially when integrated with OpenStack, but I feel like if you're going for ""Free"" there are more competitive offerings. Windows Hyper-V is free, for example, and can be managed from any Windows 7/8 desktop via RSAT (Soon, Windows 10 once they release RSAT again). Upgrading isn't a chore, and you get the benefit of learning Hyper-V's many quirks.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend Hyper-V over ESXi, but I'd recommend it on the same level as ProxMox and Xen."

Went from being a network admin (And thus working with either Cisco or Linux/BSD-based devices along with previous_job's internal linux servers) to being a consultant on a small team. Small businesses typically don't have the user infrastructure to support Linux, so they all run Windows. We have a grand total of one linux box, that I stood up with a very specific purpose, and that is internal.  But, it was a pretty good pay increase, and I find that newer versions of Windows Server are actually pretty comfortable for me. Win2k3 still drives me through the wall though."

Fortunately I have one very Open Source friendly large client that I manage which let's me tinker a bit. Otherwise it's Windows forever. But my last job, another MSP, all of their infrastructure and webservers were *nix systems and only the desktops/workstations were Windows for compatibility purposes. I miss my old job. But hey, if you are making more money in the Windows gig, more power to you. I'm thinking about going into Linux\Security consulting myself as a full time gig."
homelab,3cm1hb,bahwhateverr,2,Fri Jul 10 00:58:05 2015 UTC,"If I went back to being a full time admin, I'd probably end up going to Windows Sysad.

That being said, the dream job is still a netad somewhere with a big cisco network where I can not talk to people outside my team and just perform magic.  Sidenote, that I think most of you who have supported WiFi before will know: Networking is a special form of black magic, and WiFi is apparently akin to summoning the devil himself and having him do your bidding. Nothing beats having a call and having the person go ""Well, can't you just remote in and fix it?"" followed by your response of ""If I could, we probably wouldn't be having this conversation right now..."""

I haven't tried a Chromestick or w/e and I did try using Kodi on my FireTV, that was not my favorite.  I did try OpenELEC with a Raspberry Pi B+ and found it kinda laggy, and if it lost power it was a pain in the ass to reset the clock.

I think the only way to simulate is to add a switch card to a router, but the functions don't really translate the same as a real switch.

You said you didn't care much about power consumption, but comparing performance per watt with the 8350 would embarrass the 2419.  If you want to experiment with FreeNAS and/or with proxmox clustering (or other clustering technologies) you pretty much have to go with the C6105. Since I don't know what kind of loads (cpu/memory/io) the game servers you want to run require I'd have a hard time recommending one over the other.

It could be one or more of these three things   You are CPU Bound, so you need more processing power. In this case, it would be a good idea to buy dual xeon socket boards with something like x5670 (I bought two of those recently for ~$180). You are memory bound because you have to load a lot of images simultaneously. In this case, more RAM the merrier. Dual CPU board usually have a lot of slots for RAM, but even single CPU enthusiast consumer boards support 32-64 GB RAM these days.  You are I/O bound, meaning that you need faster disk speed. In that case, perhaps you want to just use SSD or high speed HDD.    Once you have decided what you really want, perhaps the people here can help you. I think $500-600 is a good budget if you are OK with buying old part. Here is what I have estimated for my current build.

Insurance companies here are pricks too but providing you put in the work, they can't say shit.  For example we listed everything in the house to how many sqft had ceramic tile or granite, what KIND of hardwood and how much, faucets, crown molding, solid vs hollow core doors, etc. Everything possible and the insurance company came back and said ""Ok based on that our estimator says 250k should cover the rebuild""  We immediately responded ""Well thats pretty funny because I gave the same quote to 3 other builders and the lowest price was 280, highest was 340. So how the hell did your guy calculate his number""  Ofcourse at that point they had to go with our quotes, they settled on a build cost of 300k for the house. objects within the house was a whole other story, we're still fighting it out but we have an itemized list. They just keep taking our total required to replace everything and dropping it 30+ percent."

Also its common knowledge that you're not going to buy all the stuff again so they reduce. Its perfectly legal for them to evaluate using a different model than you do because they can back it up with actuarial formulas. If you want to try and prove your DVD player has gained in value in your possession then by all means make the attempt.  But misrepresenting the value of the items in your claim IS fraud.

They won't cover it. Your options are to take /U/SadKangaroo's advice and hope for the best or just eat it. Also make ABSOLUETLY sure of your coverage. Most policies have a (rediculously) low cap on Luxury goods and electronics. My policy by default only covered 5k in electronics, I had to get a rider to boost it to 25k. They don't really volunteer this info, and it'll be buried in your policy if it's listed at all."

homelab,3cii2j,sponslerm,2,Sat Jul 11 14:42:31 2015 UTC,"It depends I guess, in some cases stuff like burst pipes and sewer backup are covered or can be covered with a slight increase in premium through regular home owners/renters insurance.  I'm sure it varies by state and insurance carrier.    For example, NY has many valleys and variations of elevation.  According to Google Earth, I live 1.54 miles inland from the Hudson river as the crow flies and the elevation change is 302ft.  So if my house naturally flooded... it would be an extinction level event so I don't carry flood insurance.  That being said, I think it added $50 dollars to my yearly home owners premium, but it covers sewer backups and pipes bursting and any resulting damage."

homelab,3cii2j,Doctorphate,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:30:11 2015 UTC,"I do know this from experience both from working in the Insurance industry myself for several years and from dealing with my step mother's Mother's house going up in flames. Her laptop was in a cabinet and when the fire department put out the house they drenched the entire house in water(obviously). The laptop is FINE except that it smells of smoke and when we got it out had moisture inside the cabinet. The laptop works and everything but they're replacing it to the tune of $2000.  If you cover your bases with documentation for all your losses, insurance companies can't do anything to deny you unless you're at your policy cap.  For example the CONTENTS of her house were covered up to $300,000. We counted everything room by room from spoons to flat screen TVs and came up at $380,000. They came back and offered 200k, we responded with $380k, they came back at 280k and we're going to accept it. The reality is the lady is 80 years old, she doesn't need a new china set, or 4 TVs or new silverwear, or two freezers or 2 dehumidifiers, 3 beds, etc. Once the house is rebuilt she's likely going to move anyway.  But point being is, if you have good documentation you wont have issues. I suggest a seperate spread sheet for every room which has a column for item/cost new/cost to replace/ 2 links to prove price. When you get to electronics, simply provide evidence of water damage(pictures showing moisture on or near the board) and links to evidence showing your equipment has been damaged by that moisture.  You have to remember, your job is to get the maximum allowed out of the insurance company, the insurance company's job is to pay out as little as possible.

If your going to be running so manuy VM's & similar OS's the deduplication will help you out a lot and save a ton of space.   I would put the two SSD's in RAIDZ 1, or get four 256GB SSD's and make two RADIZ1 sets. You could then get some 10K disks and make a RAIDZ (RAID5) out of those.   Give ZFS 8GB or 16GB of RAM if you can and you should not be limited by IO, as all your writes will be done in RAM and read's from the SSD's in RAID.   I would use LXC for linux guests which do not strict isolation and use KVM for Windows Gusts and any Linux guests that do need strict isolation. If you've not used proxmox before, you will find you can fit a lot more VM's per server when you use a mix of containers and KVM. I have 17 running right now using just 8.5GB of RAM.   Proxmox 4.0 is coming out soon, it will introduce LXC containers which are replacing Open VZ. It will also have ZFS replication, so you can sync your ZFS data between hosts if you wish."

Does this imply that you cannot replicate the problem with just one VM running?  If that is the case, the problem may be the result of resource scheduling contention caused by this:   All VM's that i've tried have had 1 processor with 8 cores   You have a CPU with only 8 cores (including hyper threads). If all running multiple VMs with 8 cores, VMware can only schedule one VM to run at a time. Hence the jittery network performance as scheduler tries to be fair to all your VMs.  Here's a article about how the VMware scheduler works (from 5.1, but should still be applicable to 5.5).  Try assigning VMs the minimum number of CPU cores they need to run."

That functionality is provided by the card at the driver level, so if the card supports your OS and supports IPoIB then it'll work.  If you have a target that supports SRP that is the gravy train. I don't think anything except direct attached 12Gbps SAS will out perform it. If you're in the Windows world, 2012 R2 to be exact, you can do SMB Direct which is a performance monster. Alternatively you can do IPoIB and then use whatever TCP/IP transport you want: iSCSI, NFS, SMB.  Infiniband requires a subnet manager. You can get this two ways, either from a managed switch or by running OpenSM that comes with the OFED software package.   A card I have been eyeing lately is the Mellanox ConnectX-2 VPI (MHQH29B-XTR). It's a dual port card that can run QDR (40Gbps) infiniband or 10Gbps ethernet on either port, and you can even mix them up. Mellanox has drivers for this card for Linux, FreeBSD, Windows, ESXi, and probably some others I'm forgetting. The OFED versions of their drivers also include the OpenSM I mentioned above. You can find them used on ebay for $70-$80 and the QDR cables should not be more then $20.  Edit: sorry OP, no one in this sub has a clue about infiniband. Seek info elsewhere.

You save a bit of money on the adapters... you save a LOT of money on the switches (compared to 10gig ethernet) It can be picky to get working the first time: drivers often require very specific firmware versions: be prepared to spend some time flashing things if you buy used gear (and remember: nothing works until a subnet manager is running, even if your cabling/drivers/adapters are installed perfectly) My Linux/Solaris/ESXi systems see good IPoIB performance: Windows has been consistently 30%-50% slower (though I'm using ConnectX-2 and older cards) Related to the last one: Linux has fantastic IB support: when troubleshooting any Windows IB problem I'd often swap parts into Linux to narrow down if the problem was drivers/cables/firmware/adapter IB switches with a subnet manager baked in are nice, and are worth paying a couple extra $ for   Having said all that... although I have a stable setup now... I wouldn't do it all again unless I was only using Linux, or could take advantage of RDMA. Once you start rolling in ESXi and Windows... and since I'm using IPoIB for all services... I would have preferred to eat the $100-per-switch-port cost and done everything with 10gig ethernet w/SFP+ everywhere. Just easier to set up and maintain and get recent drivers for."
homelab,3cgon4,eskodhi,2,Tue Jul 7 22:34:22 2015 UTC,"The only uses of Infiniband I'm aware of nowadays are two:   Inside high-performance / supercomputing clusters.  Even here, I think it's sort of a dead technology, but I think there are some big systems still using it.  There was a time when I guess it was the fastest switched fabric you could get, as a node interconnect. In some big-money corporate SANs.  I've worked on some SANs that used Infiniband, of some sort, to connect the disk shelves and racks together.  But it looked pretty... proprietary.  All single-vendor stuff.   I don't doubt that you can pick it up for cheap, and part of me is sort of in the same frame of mind as you, that it'd be fun to play around with, but on the other hand I've had that same feeling lead me to a lot of frustration in the past.  Most of the Infiniband gear you can find is likely to be 2.5Gb stuff (I think there were proposals for faster speeds but I don't think they were very popular? might be wrong there) so you could bond a couple of GigE links and get almost the same speed, or you could get 10GbE for not too much money and I think you'd have something that wouldn't be nearly as much of a pain in the ass in the future.  EDIT:  So apparently the common flavor of Infiniband is 16Gb, because of some weirdness it does with 2.5 Gb per normal speed channel and then it's commonly double data-rate and there's 4 channels.  Which is neat, but still as a practical matter you'd have to have a really nice disk system to make 10 vs 16 Gb worth the extra effort.  There are 10GbE cards floating around eBay right now for $50, and they'll work with Cat5e over short distances (I've heard people say 50 feet).  I'd think really hard about that instead."

You can also try to get a 24 or 48 port unmanaged switch tho, for future proofing and to avoid the bottleneck between the switches this would be the best option. If you also want fine control over your network, QoS, VLANs, etc. you will need a managed switch.   TL, DR: just want ports and no bandwith intensive stuff going on? Sure, add another one."
homelab,3cjhc5,silvadiego1512,3,Wed Jul 8 11:54:16 2015 UTC,"Switches (especially the unmanaged kind) don't route, they switch (They are Layer 2 functional devices, routing is a Layer 3 function).  Besides that, the only real negative here is if you have a storage server on Switch 1, and a client on Switch 2 trying to access or upload files to the storage server, it can very quickly saturate the single 1gbps link between switches. That being said, it's only an issue for you if you really have other bandwidth intensive things going on at the same time, which you probably don't.  Unmanaged switches are ""dumb fabric"" and don't support any real features, or what they do support is basic and automatic. Link Aggregation is a great idea, but would require you to have a managed switch, or two if you wanted to do port aggregation between the two switches. A managed switch would indeed allow you to do QoS, VLANs, and other enhanced Layer 2 functions.  And, for what it's worth, if you want a switch that really WILL route traffic to all sorts of devices, you could get a Layer 3 switch, though be aware that many of the lower-end Layer 3 switches have extremely limited speed when ""Routing"" rather than ""Switching."""

For HBAs you should avoid Emulex on the target side and use QLogic cards.  If you're just connecting two machines, I'll echo what others have said: Go with 10GbE. At this point 4Gb FC really only makes sense if (a) you just really want to play with FC or (b) your storage server doesn't have enough slots to host all of the 10GbE connections you would need to connect all of your system. 4-port FC cards are readily available and 4Gb FC switches are much cheaper than 10GbE switches.   My storage server has 2x 4-port FC cards with 2 connections to each of my VMware servers. It's nearly as fast as 10GbE thanks to MPIO and I avoided needing a switch."

Likewise, you need a FC initiator on the client to map the block storage locally.  This is pretty similar to iSCSI, only the SCSI commands are not encapsulated over IP. FCoE also somewhat similar, but you additionally the network switch needs to support it (converged network fabric)."

But, in my experience at least, VMWare is more prevalent and will give you better experience for future job opportunities.   Now you don't need to decide between Windows Server 2012 or some of the *nix recommendations in this thread. Spin up virtual machines of both types.  Now spin up a Windows Server 2012 VM (core... R2 if you have access) and make a small domain... install Server Manager on your personal computer and see how easy it is to manage a Server Core machine... its really not so scary. Now you have a small domain and also a launching point to learn PowerShell.  Spin up some *nix boxes. I like Ubuntu Server because there is so much documentation out there.

You won't be able to use V-Motion or any of the other fancy things enterprises want. That's what VMware charges for.

For a more ""realistic"" option, it depends on what you're most familiar with, and if you'd want to bother learning about what you aren't familiar with. I happen to be familiar with Windows 7, but have had little experience with Windows Server versions. Nothing I run is really mission-critical, so I'd just stick with 7.  For another option, Linux is also a nice choice. Ubuntu is a fairly popular choice, and has both a desktop and server flavor, along with support. Fedora is my personal favorite (and also has a desktop and server flavor).

I believe the ILOM on that host is pretty capable of showing temperature sensors all over the place.  Establish a baseline of what the box looks like in the stock config so you have some idea whether your modifications are providing the same amount of cooling.  I am also curious how the system monitoring is going to handle what essentially will look like failed fan units, or likely unmatched RPM values (if you use the same connectors).  I believe that system has variable speed fans.    Have you already fired the system up and let everything settle to determine how loud it is?  That thing will sound like a jet plane when you first start it, but it should settle down.  It's been a very long time since I have messed around with Sun gear, but I thought there was an OS component that also managed fan speed (as opposed to simply having the system board manage it on it's own).    So - I would: * make sure that there are no firmware updates that address noise * make sure that the Power Supplies are ALL plugged in and working * install whatever OS packages Sun recommends for managing the host    Congrats on that box though - that thing seems like a monster!

You can put a new v4 turbo into the v8 chassis but you still have a lot of equipment to move which will cost you in power consumption.  The machine still has a lot of value. Do not replace it just because it is older. Just to get the same amount of RAM you would easily spend $1000, a new CPU, and at least $250 for a motherboard that would be able to handle that much RAM.

Labbing is especially different. You can build a VM, throw it a handful of small VMDKs, put them in a dynamic volume in the VM's OS, then put another FS on that, then iscsi target vhds with yet another file system on that.

It gets regular updates from the creator and I know he encourages people to look at the config to make sure there is no security holes.  In the end you get a secure mail server, with SPF, DKIM & DNSSEC. It also includes owncloud, for calendar and contacts sync.   You can host this at Vultr for $5 on their 786MB Plan, just drop their tech support a message to ask for the email restrction to be lifted as they block port 25 by default.

I've run it at home behind a Nginx Reverse Proxy server that has a wildcard cert ($99/yr from Namecheap), but just set up Mail-in-a-Box.    I am hosting mine on a 768MB Vultr VPS for $5/mo, and performance is great.  I was able to use my existing wildcard cert from my other server, and utilize the same domain name (obviously).  But I didn't follow the directions exactly, since my setup was non-standard (according to the Mail-in-a-Box documentation).  Moved my contacts and calendar to that OwnCloud setup, and will now only use my local OwnCloud setup for file sharing.    All in all, took about 60 minutes to set EVERYTHING up, from start to finish.  Performance is good, the admin interface is pretty nice, and it just works.  As long as that VPS doesn't silently die, I'll be more than happy with this setup."
homelab,3cgp0n,devianteng,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:49:35 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'll have to bite the bullet on that wildcard cert. My biggest problem around these things is that they're so heavily revolving around Linux, which I hardly know. Do you have any advice on where to start/what to know before starting to setup servers?"
homelab,3cgp0n,devianteng,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:23:41 2015 UTC,"The cert was definitely one of my best investments.  I had used self-signed wildcard certs for the two years prior to buying one, and I wish I would have bought one sooner.  Things with my phone, especially, work better now.    The Mail-in-a-Box setup is super simple (yet not very customizable), and that's how it's designed.  Get a Ubuntu 14.04 x64 VPS, and run a single command to grab and run a bash script to do the install.  It prompts you with a few things, and it's just easy.    What I don't like about it, is that it expects you to change your domain name's nameservers and set them to this MiaB server (aka, box), and use the box as DNS for that domain name.  I can see where that makes sense, but I use that domain name for several things, and setting it up that way would have broke several other things for me.  Instead, I created a sub-domain in my DNS records at GoDaddy (box.domain.com), and on my wildcard DNS record (*.domain.com), I set a MX record to point to box.domain.com.  Pretty easy, and it worked.    As far as advice on getting started with SSL certs, well, there is plenty of documentation out there.  Most CA (Certificate Authorities) have documentation for different web servers (I use Nginx as a Reverse Proxy at home, since I like it more than Apache -- but MiaB uses Apache), and that documentation can probably walk you through it better than I can.  Once you follow the documentation and request/receive your new cert, it's as simple as copying those files to your server, and telling your webserver where to find those files."

homelab,3cened,phishpin,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:20:34 2015 UTC,"I've been using ZoneMinder for a while now. It has a fairly steep learning curve, and not all configuration can be done from the web UI (for example, setting up schedules for when you want cameras to switch from recording on motion to recording constantly requires adding a line to your crontab). You can watch cameras live and review recorded events in the web UI of course though.  My VM for ZoneMinder has 1 vCPU and 512MB RAM running Debian 7. My motion detection settings are simple, and for two cameras my system load hovers around 0.15. Storage is an NFS-mounted ZFS array.  I tried Ubiquiti's Unifi Video stuff last year. The cameras and NVR software are quite good, but they only work with each other. You can't use different software for the cameras, and the software only supports Ubiquiti's cameras. There is no ONVIF support nor RTSP (for anyone that used this gear in the past, they removed RTSP support in the cameras themselves!). The NVR software can be installed on a vanilla Linux distro though via apt / yum repos. They also sell a NVR device, which uses the same software. The lock-in is what ultimately made me go with ZoneMinder. If you don't mind that, then it's pretty nice and the cameras are affordable."

It cannot route VLAN IP traffic (layer 3) so you need a device that can, such as your Sonicwall.  You will want to setup two trunk ports that contain your VLAN's.  These ports should ingress to the R710, and the Sonicwall.    Then in your VM's define the VLAN they will sit on.  From reading your post a few times, it sounds like you are missing the layer 3 component of your design."

homelab,3cdu3s,canhazraid,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:53:19 2015 UTC,If you plan to route between vlans of similar security context it's usually advantageous to do it on the switch itself.  This becomes more true in a larger network where you don't want traffic traversing the network to be routed.  For home lab I would generally recommend a HP or Cisco switch that can do line rate L3 such as a Cisco 3750g.

You'll need to create two VLAN interfaces in the SonicWall each tagged with the appropriate VL with the appropriate subnets. If you add both of them to the ""LAN"" zone inside your SonicWall, the default ruleset should allow both of them to communicate with each other as well as with the outside world. If they are in separate zones, or if you've created custom zones, you'd need to modify your config accordingly."

homelab,3cdu3s,oldspiceland,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:11:13 2015 UTC,"OK dumb question. When planning my network I had the idea of using 10.10.x.x/255.255.0.0. I was going to make 10.10.0.x equipment.  Sonicwall, switch, drac, server, nas. 10.10.1.x home network with all the PC's and devices. 10.10.2.x test network ....etc...etc. So these can obviously communicate with each other no problem as the mask allows it. But I guess for VLANs it doesn't work that way. I'm not able to add the VLAN to the Sonicwall because 10.10.4.x ""Subnet on this interface overlaps with another interface""    So it looks like I'm going to have to shorten the mask (255.255.255.0) and just create the VLANs on the sonicwall interface for routing each VLAN/other subnet like 10.10.2.x to the gateway of 10.10.0.1. Does this make sense...is this smart...or am I going about this segmentation/IP scheme the wrong way?"
homelab,3cdu3s,oldspiceland,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:06:00 2015 UTC,"1.) You should never have physically or logically separate LAN on the same subnet. Not because it will cause the world to end, but because it simply makes life more difficult for you (counter-intuitively perhaps).  2.) Treat each VLAN as if it were a unique, separate, local area network, with the SonicWall in-between these two unique networks. The SonicWall is the only point of communication between these two networks, and these two networks should have unique subnets to reflect that (10.10.10.0/24 and 10.10.40.0/24 as examples) Each VLAN interface on the Sonicwall will have an IP in it's respective subnet (X0:10 (X0 physical interface, VLAN10) will have an IP of 10.10.10.1, X0:40 will have an IP of 10.10.40.1. Since these networks are directly connected, you don't need to fiddle with routing rules, they will route to each other automagically. As long as they are in the same zone (LAN zone is a default on modern Sonicwalls) then they will be able to communicate with each other by routing through the SonicWall.  3.) Always keep in mind that a LAN (Physically separated or logically separated via VLAN) is a Layer-2 entity. Where it ends, you must jump to Layer 3 to cross that border. That's the job of a router, which your SonicWall is in addition to being a firewall.  As long as you keep those three concepts in your mind, VLANs are really simple, and extremely straightforward. Where people often get confused is thinking that they are something that they aren't. VLANs are designed to separate Layer 2 traffic from each other, meaning that VL40 has no Layer 2 connection to VL10, unless you've created a switching loop. Since they don't connect via Layer 2, you must connect them via Layer 3."

LACP is not a bonded interface where 10x1GB is the same as a 10GB interface.  You are still limited to 1GB per connection.  You would need something such as LACP configured in round robin mode to allow two streams to take different paths and have an aggrigate throughput over that of a single connection.  LACP and single TCP connections are still limited to the throughput of an individual path.

homelab,3cdtwt,barkler,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:25:33 2015 UTC,"I am by no means an expert on the subject, but I will explain what I can.  ASICs aren't important for NAS/Server traffic by itself. It is a technology used in switches to quickly and efficiently transfer data from 1 port to another, or multiple ports in some cases. It is kind of like a fast CPU, but solely for switching decisions. Routers by nature are slower than switches, because they use a CPU to make decisions on routing traffic. This is where layer 3 switches come in to play. Layer 3 switches use ACICs to route at layer 2 and layer 3. So where a router is normally needed to make decisions on how to get between different subnets, a layer 3 switch can now do this.  Some layer 3 switches only support static routes, but more expensive ones support basic routing protocols like OSPF and RIP.  Mikrotik layer 3 switches however, aren't really layer 3 switches. They still use the CPU to route between subnets. I haven't been able to find any information on this though. So I do not know if their ""layer 3 switches"" are better optimized for layer 3 operation and can handle more pps and a higher throughput than their routers doing the same thing. All I've been able to find and confirm is that their routing uses the CPU and not the switch ASIC.  As far as whether or not a Mikrotik switch will work for your situation or not depends. Layer 3 switching will matter if your network is subnetted and you will have high volumes of traffic flowing between those subnets, ie NAS is on 192.168.1.0/24 and your VM server is on 192.168.2.0/24. In this scenario, your VM server would have to route between subnets, requiring a router or layer 3 switch. The other thing to take in to consideration is the throughput. You may not be using up enough bandwidth in your environment, so relying on the CPU to route between subnets may not be of concern, but if you are trying to using something like etherchan or some other link aggregation protocol for high speed data transfers, you might want a real layer 3 switch.  Hopefully that answers your question...."

homelab,3cd82y,MrGeekFreak,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:41:41 2015 UTC,"I would most definitely agree with Sophos.    I used pfSense at my parents' house for about 2-3 years, and made a random decision to try Sophos out when I left for college.  After running it for about a year in my apartment (for home use), it came up in conversation with my parents, and my mom said that her company - of about 500 employees - used it.  I have to say - pfSense is great, and has the 'muscle' to do a LOT. However, Sophos has a much nicer WebUI and (iirc) runs a heavily modified version of SUSE, rather than pfSense's version of FreeBSD. Personally, I think everything about Sophos just seems more 'professional' and easier-to-use.  It has end-point protection for the computers on your network, has very simple-to-configure firewall/download/site access settings, a user portal, and an integrated VPN solution.  Coming from someone that transitioned from pfSense to Sophos - it was a good move."

homelab,3cd2jv,adamksmith,3,Mon Jul 6 23:38:28 2015 UTC,"I have 4x R610s in my lab, obviously I like them. Because iLo has been mention: for $22 you can buy an iDRAC enterprise card and have a remote console interface through Java on a dedicated Ethernet port. The 11 generation Dells do not have licensing requirement for the iDRAC, it's entirely hardware dependent functionality. The R610 is a 11G.  As for quirks, Dells can be temperamental when it comes to changing RAM configuration, but as long as you follow the instructions on the inside panel everything will install nicely. This is true with all the servers brands I've touched. Some of Dell's RAID cards (SAS 6i/r) do use proprietary connectors but their backplanes use standard SFF8087 SAS connectors.  I will say I am entirely bias when it comes to HP. I don't buy their products, similar to how some refuse to shop at WalMart.  As for noise, not that you asked. On L series 56xx Xeons the R610 is really quiet. In fact is quieter than my desktop in the same room which by no stretch is loud. The E series 56xx Xeons are marginally louder. However when I turn on my R610 with the X series 56xx Xeon, holy shit it's loud; unbearable. I typically only turn that one on when I have something processor intensive to do and I plan to work from a different room.   As for power draw (pulled from a previous post of mine):   This was performed on this hardware configuration:   Dell Poweredge R610   1x 502 watt PSU, 80Plus Gold 32GB RAM 2x Intel L5630 CPU - 4 cores at 2.13Ghz 4 ports of 1GB Ethernet 1 iDRAC Enterprise 1 port 4GB Fiberchannel PCIe card No harddrive backplane installed, no CD-ROM drive.    The large point of this exercise was to demonstrate max power draw, however I added data point up to that point as a frame of reference.   Solid 14.2 watts with power just being supplied. iDRAC enterprise card running. Varying ~71.6-73.6 watts with stresslinux LiveCD at idle Solid 136 watts with stress -c 4 running (One socket's physical cores in use) Solid 159 watts with stress -c 8 running (All physical cores in use) Solid 157 watts with stress -c 16 running (All logical cores in use) Varying ~185-188 watts with stress -c 8 -m 18 running (All physical cores in use, max memory utilization for CPUs.) Peak at 192 watts with stress -c 8 -m 18 running and the fans kicking up to 10k RPM for 6 seconds. Even with the fans going that fast the rack was still really quiet. I was able to hear the sound of scratching dry skin from across the room. Not scientific I know, but tell me you didn't just scratch your arm.   This is with one 502 watt PSU attached, a 80Plus Gold rated one. If another PSU is added about ~15watts additional watts will be drawn. If two PSUs are attached they will load balance but there will be about 15 additional watts of waste. I booted stresslinux over the iDRAC Virtual Media with the Java based console interface. The fan noise was nearly the same the entire testing session, at one point some of the fans bumped up to a 10k RPM per the iDRAC hardware monitoring, they died down after 6 seconds. The performance can be configured for a few different presets through the BIOS under Power Management. I have all my Dells configured for OS Control.   Keep in mind your biggest bottleneck is going to be your disk drives in a virtualized environment. You'll have more IO than spinning disk can provide in a responsive way. I imagine the difference between the hardware platforms are going to be negligible given they are the same generation. The biggest difference between the brands will be how they wrote their BIOS and iDRAC interface which more than anything comes down to personal preference. I always stutter when navigating a HP bios but find it more developed than the Dells. However more RAM is more RAM.  My bias vote is a R610."

homelab,3ce2jc,masterchi01,2,Tue Jul 7 04:46:32 2015 UTC,Your Fios issue is very resolvable.  Here is what you need to do to get the Verizon router out of the way and not lose the digital features of your STB: - Call Fios tech support and ask them to provision the Ethernet port on your ONT. They will do this no issue.  - Make sure you release the Wan ip on the Fios router before the next step.  - Connect the wan port of your dd-wrt router to the Ethernet port on the ONT. Your router should now have a wan ip and be up and running.  - Finally plug the Wan port of the Fios router in to the Lan port on your dd-wrt. The Fios router will now be NATed of your DD-WRT and will act as a Moca bridge to the STBs and give them all of the Internet access they need.

It sounds like you want the lab to simulate a Windows domain environment, but have your main home PC run the clients through VMWare?  It sounds like what you need is to replace your router with something a little more robust and will allow you to route between subnets. You might also want a switch that can handle VLANs depending on what your goals are and what type of expansion you want.  As far as running VMWare for your client's on your Home PC, I'd strongly suggest another NIC dedicated to the VM. This will allow you to put the clients on the same subnet as your lab setup, or on its own subnet to separate it from your home environment.  It really all depends on what you are trying to accomplish though."
homelab,3ce2jc,matthaios637,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:51:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you for commenting matthaios637  I apologize if I didn't explain fully my goal.  You are correct that I'm looking to simulate a Windows domain environment.  One idea (which I can live if its not feasible) was to use VMWare Workstation with Bridged networking to have VM's as clients and the physical ""Lab Box"" loaded with ESXi and run the DHCP/DNS server, SQL Server, SCCM 2012 CAS, SCCM 2012 Primary, Exchange 2013, Sharepoint 2013, etc.    I'd love to replace my router but the Verizon FIOS uses MOCA for Set Top Boxes so if I take my router out (or turn off DHCP) then my TVs no longer display channel information nor do I get ""ondemand"".  I need the lab to have internet connectivity (download patches for WSUS) but I'm just unsure how to connect it to my Verizon Router for Internet while still utilizing a Windows DHCP server for ESXi and keeping the FIOS Router as a DHCP Server as well for the TV STB.  I haven't used PFSense but I hear it mentioned a lot on here and wonder if instead of buying another switch/router if I could use that to accomplish what I need.  Otherwise I was looking into the HP 1920-16g.  I just don't know how I should configure it high level-wise (connect what cable to where, create how many VLANs, should the ""Home PC"" or the ""Lab Box"" be on the VLAN, etc).  I know enough googling can get me the commands I need to configure the VLANs and static routes...I just have no clue on where to start with what I might need.  Hopefully I didn't confuse things more."
homelab,3ce2jc,matthaios637,2,Wed Jul 8 04:05:09 2015 UTC,"I had to look up how Verizon networks are setup. I was not familiar with their MOCA network setup. I found this link with a ton of information.  http://www.dslreports.com/faq/verizonfios/3.0_Networking  From your ONT, is your router connected through ethernet, coax, or both? Also, are you only concerned with guide information on the STBs or do you want caller id and remote access to your DVR? Once you answer those questions, I can recommend a setup that will fit all your needs.  As far as your lab stuff goes, you will have to have at least 1 other NIC on your Home PC to be able to get DHCP to work with your Lab box. With only 1 connection, you will get DHCP from your router, and anything on VM on that machine will end up NATed through VM, so it cannot get its own IP from your Lab box and the hosts would also be double NATed. The easiest for you would be to just run the VMs on the lab box as well. You could virtualize all the networking as well."
homelab,3ce2jc,christheradioguy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:13:04 2015 UTC,"Nice find Matthaios637, very interesting read.  Option #6 in that link sounds like something thats feasible on my end.  From my ONT the Verizon router is connected by coax so it sounds like I'd have to test out the ethernet port on the ONT and if it doesn't work contact Verizon to enable it.  I might have to get a new router though as the ddwrt router I have is a 10+ year old Linksys WRT54G so I definitely want something newer/faster if it becomes my primary to FIOS speeds.  I don't use Caller ID or a DVR, just a standard STB.  I see your point about getting a second NIC on the ""Home PC"".  In that case I could connect NIC 1 to the Verizon Router and the secondary NIC to the ddwrt router for the VMs.  That would theoretically get me internet on both subnets while keeping things segregated.  As far as I understand it the computers on the secondary router (Verizon in this example) would be able to see Lab VMs on the primary ddwrt router but the Lab VMs connected to the primary router would not be able to communicate with the computers on the secondary router (verizon) without me setting a static route.  Does that sound correct?  My big worry is telling SCCM to push out a client to entire network and my ""Home PCs"" now have SCCM installed.  Also, when you mention virtualizing the networking..do you mean inside of ESXi?  Obviously with me being a complete amateur at physical networking I'm even less confident with virtual networking but I'm willing to try anything.  I really appreciate all your help and suggestions thus far matthaios637."

With your VM's, either put them on VLAN10, or create a seperate VLAN for servers.  For their connection, expose one of the connections to VLAN20, and plug their access point into that port.

If so, it'd probably work just to use a wireless router or AP with a guest network/VLAN function, then you could set your blacklist rules or VLANs and it'd be walled off from the rest of the network. One device I know of that would do that would be the Ubiquiti UniFi AP, which is usually around $60 on Amazon. If they want to use the connection you already have set up, they should play by your rules.

homelab,3c86fh,racer951y,2,Sun Jul 5 23:44:45 2015 UTC,It depends what you want to do at first. I think most people start out with storage solutions (1) or get their network configured (2) how they want it first.  (1) Storage: you could start out with a dedicated spare PC that has a few spare harddrives (perhaps externals for backups would suffice for starting) and get some basic backups going for your network/PC and probably a file server for media/documents perhaps.   (2) Network configuration: switches and routers and those fancy network logical maps.
homelab,3c86fh,Genesis2001,45,Mon Jul 6 05:51:09 2015 UTC,"Its a decent idea, but unfortunately I don't think it would be near as easy as a gaming PC list.

homelab,3c86fh,THECOACH0742,5,Sun Jul 5 22:51:34 2015 UTC,Not many people are going to come out and ask. This sub could probably help out a lot of people by coming up with a few generic builds for home setups of varying budgets.

homelab,3c86fh,THECOACH0742,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:22:21 2015 UTC,"I feel like if we could put up maybe two builds per ""category"" (Storage server, virtual host, bare-metal microserver) then the list wouldn't be that cumbersome. Essentially a ""Budget"" and a ""Mild""...we really don't need a ""Wild"" build because honestly with Enterprise hardware you can spec out a multi-grand monster but there's always going to be more out there.  We take those six builds, keep them relatively up-to-date and then have some pointers about things like used enterprise equipment and a list of inexpensive but feature-full network gear and you don't really end up with that much work overall. Honestly, you could even drop it down to two categories (Storage servers, virtual hosts) and talk about prebuilt NAS devices (Synologies) and ultra-small-form-factor devices (NUCs and the like) and only have four real builds on there. This isn't THAT much work.  Budget virtual host cluster: 2x Virtual Host Budget Builds, 1x Budget Storage Build, networking gear as needed. The trick that people who are new to homelabbing won't know is things like buying the ~right~ card to flash to IT/JBOD mode if they want to run ZFS, or buying an inexpensive but reliable enterprise level RAID card if they want hardware raid. Those are things a lot of us veterans know, but that new guys may not even know ~to ask~."

homelab,3c86fh,oldspiceland,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:39:53 2015 UTC,"I think the issue with actual builds is that it's not that useful from a learning point for most beginners, and gives a sense of 'you should go buy this thing' instead of 'lets talk about things that will do what you need them to do'. Lets face it, Grandma and Little Jimmy don't show up on /r/homelab/ and decide to start tinkering. Even the most basic folks here have a working knowledge of the basic bits and bobs in a computer. If they don't, they should probably do that first. Building a home lab without understanding what the parts do is like buying a $6000 Les Paul to go take your first guitar lesson.  To that end, I think most absolute beginners probably start by throwing together parts from the junk box and cannibalizing old systems, then throwing an OS or type 1 or 2 on it and see if it sticks. Then fix/refine/add until it just doesn't do the job any more, and start looking to upgrade. At that point, they're going to have a much better idea about what they want or need (as long as they keep realistic expectations), which I guess is where something like a build kit comes in.  Two things that spring to mind, along the same lines as a build kit. First is what you mentioned about tips and tricks for people without deep knowledge. Things like what parts work, what's a good deal and a dud, what kinds of things constitute a good upgrade, pitfalls to avoid, etc. That stuff is all floating out there, in /homelab/ threads, on blog posts, and forums, but aggregating it would be an absolute gold mine for people getting their feet wet.  Second, kind of the reverse of a build kit. Paint what variously levels of hardware can do in broad strokes - ie you have a crappy Dell desktop from '07? Perfect pfsense box or LAMP server. Just replaced your gaming desktop? Plex server or NAS. Just got a 2950 off eBay? Great for ESXi/Xen/type 1. Give tiered generalizations of CPUs, RAM, networking equipment and the package and show what it can do, and what it can do with some reasonable upgrades. You could even weave some build kit suggestions into it with 'example hardware'. Show people what they can do with the hardware they have, and where they need to step up to get to the next level, with realistic expectations, and you'll show them the path without leading them on it.  The first coupled with the second in a wiki/faq form is more 'teach a man to fish' than feeding him off the deli tray. I think it both imparts the deep, dark knowledge that's collected in a place like this, and gets people to look critically at what they have, what they want, and what they can do with it."
homelab,3c86fh,synk2,2,Tue Jul 7 06:32:07 2015 UTC,"I agree that most people come here with a basic knowledge of consumer level/desktop computer components. I disagree that they would necessarily know what an 8088 cable is for or what the difference between SAS and SATA is. To that end, part of ""teaching a man to fish"" in this case is telling him when to use a net, and when to use a rod. That's something we all gained either from trial/error experience...or from someone else telling us.  The goal here is to PREVENT new homelabbers from coming to /r/homelab and seeing the $6000 Les Paul setups and assuming that they need to buy THAT to get started. That leads to two things...either they DO go and buy four multi-node rack mount servers and an enterprise storage array...or they just walk away and assume that homelabbing isn't something they can do. We should be working to avoid either scenario.  If we can come up with a build/part-list for $1000 that includes two compute nodes and a storage array then that's a purchasable quantity for people wanting to get started. They will have everything they need to deploy the hypervisor of choice in a redundant/HA fashion if they choose to, or to have enough compute/store to be able to run a decent lab to do things like study for MCSA or RHCSA. A whitebox buildlist like that would also prevent people from going out and buying antiques like PE2850s that are tremendously loud, tremendously power-hungry and also at this point tremendously slow compared to a consumer desktop. Having a build-list/part-list to whitebox my own stuff for a reasonable price would have likely caused me to skip purchasing my own first pair of 2950IIs."
homelab,3c86fh,oldspiceland,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:12:43 2015 UTC,"Fair points. I guess the basis of my argument is that education needs to be part of it. I think a lot of people look at a buildlist as suggestions, and extrapolate the needed materials from that, as they should. My concern would be that some others would think they need those parts, or get lost when they can't source them specifically.  I'm not against a build list, I just think that letting people know the why of what they're getting, along with a list, does a lot to progress the hobby. As someone just dipping their toe into home labs and virtualization, I understand as well as anyone how much there is to learn. I have 30 years of hardware experience as a basis, so it's easier for me to not get caught up in some of the traps, but most of my research time is spent looking for fixes to common problems, where the sweet spot for equipment lies, and some of the more esoteric knowledge that you guys have pieced together from trial and error.   So yeah, build lists go. Nothing to see here. But if you can add in some of the good educational tidbits and infodrops that are scattered around places like this, all the better."

If we had it in the Wiki, it would have to heavily monitored for false information, trolls, etc.    An open Google spreadsheet would be even worse.    The hardest this would just be the maintenance to any sort of list like that.    One thing I was mulling over is a list only editable by the mods of the sub. People could make a regular self post with a partslist, pictures, and an explanation of what it is used/is good for. Then they send a message to the mods with a link to the post and what category it is, and it could be added to the wiki in the proper section.    While this would still require a mod to look over each submission, there is really not that many people that would be contributing to it. It would be much, much easier than maintaining a list that anyone can add to."

The problem I see is not that people have a lot of different uses for CPUs, but that somebody may not necessarily have the know-how to adapt a suggested list to their needs. That's all the PCMR lists should be used as, anyway. A baseboard to build something tailored.  This could mostly be offset by offering an addendum stating what one might want in terms of hardware changes for differing needs. So for a general storage server one could have a parts list and in a description offer slightly differing hardware if one needs extra processing power or whatever that build could be adapted for.  As far as data hoarding goes what is good for one service is often acceptable for others."

You take a noticable hit to disk performance to the parity calculations, but raid5/6 allow you to lose any 1 or 2 drives, respectfully, before you data becomes vulnerable. If you still needed more reliability, go with a raid6 with hot spares allocated through the ZFS management. As soon as a drive failes it begins rebuilding to the hot spare. As for online backup, I am using crashplan installed on my windows server (it takes a little cmd trickery to force mount my network drive so that crashplan can backup from it), it is cheap and ""good enough"" should I ever need restore from backup. For comparison I am running raid 10 in my nas4free as I prefer a compromise between reliability and performance with usable capacity being least important. Utilizing (4) 3TB drives I have ~5.8TB of usable space and can suffer 1 drive failure on both stripes (2 drives are mirrored and then the mirrors are stripped - raid 10) before my data is in danger. My upload speed is the limiting factor in using crashplan and took me almost 3 months to fully backup my 3TB of data."

homelab,3c953j,UndeniablyRexer,6,Mon Jul 6 01:35:29 2015 UTC,"Not sure if what I'm about to say is completely accurate, but it seems to be the common folklore:  Given identical CPUs with the only different being HT, you will want to get the HT one, especially if your load is not ""heavy numerical computation"". For ESXi you will improve performance when using HT, but the caveat is that you should not assign more vCPU than cores (not counting HT). This means that ESXi can actually schedule VM vCPUs.  Because ESXi will schedule all of a VMs vCPUs to run in the same time slot, it needs to have enough free cores to do so. Imagine you have 4 cores, and require 2 VMs with 2 and 3 cores respectively. Those 2 VMs can never be scheduled at the same time, even if you have the necessary CPU horse power. With HT ESXi could still schedule those.  Well, at least this was the case with ESXi 5.5 ... don't know about 6."
homelab,3c953j,NicoDeRocca,3,Mon Jul 6 08:33:23 2015 UTC,"How does this work for someone running Hyper-V as the host and a Xeon chip with 4C no HTT? I've heard many people say they can run 10+ VMs (given enough RAM) simultaneously with no issue. In that context, how does over assigning vCPU affect performance?"
homelab,3c953j,GoToMSP,2,Mon Jul 6 15:44:59 2015 UTC,"The issue is a little more subtle than that. You can always ""overprovision"" CPUs as long as total usage is < 100% of your CPU, but certain configuration will lead to underutilisation. As I indicated in my previous message. Imaging you have 4C and only 2 VMs, one with 3 vCPUs and one with 2vCPUs... those 2 VMs can never be scheduled concurrently (under ESXi) because the total needed CPUs > 4. So even if both VM are at max usage, your host utilization will be then between 50% and 75% and will never get to 100%.  This behaviour might not be applicable Hyper-V though."
homelab,3c953j,NicoDeRocca,3,Tue Jul 7 08:52:08 2015 UTC,"It's a bit of a red-herring question.   If you have a CPU that has Hyperthreading, and you're choosing to leave it enabled or disabling it - then sure, leaving it enabled is almost always going to be better.  If you are comparing different CPUs, one which has HT and one which does not - then there are going to be other likely more significant differences.   Whether hyperthreading makes a difference to your applications is another thing entirely - it depends entirely on the workload."
homelab,3c953j,willhughes,2,Mon Jul 6 02:01:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the response, exactly what I was looking for.  Though it prompts a follow-up question:  aside from # of cores and clock frequency, what are important values for a CPU?  In the context of virtualization, again."
homelab,3c953j,willhughes,3,Mon Jul 6 02:04:20 2015 UTC,"Having the various hardware virtualization extensions (VT-x and AMD-V, etc) are useful, they allow the Hypervisor to offload a bunch of work.    The biggest impact is going to depend entirely on your workload.  Some workloads get more benefit from having more cache or access to more cores.   For general recommendations, I think pretty much everyone is going to say ""Get the newest Intel Xeon CPU you can afford"" and leave it at that.   If you're optimising for lower power usage, then perhaps the AMD range can be better.   CPU Smarts is a whole massive field, and not really something I want to get into on a reddit thread."

homelab,3c953j,contrarian_barbarian,2,Mon Jul 6 02:26:01 2015 UTC,Hyperthreading is getting a single CPU core to run two threads rather than one. The threads share the parts of the core. You can expect a 10%-15% performance increase (and sometimes a decrease) depending on the type of workload.  Go for the processor with more cores.
homelab,3c8xro,takennickname,5,Mon Jul 6 00:26:59 2015 UTC,If you are going to 3 different menus to port forward in Sophos you're doing it wrong.

PFSense isn't any easier when it come to port forwarding but has largely the same feature base as Sophos once you start installing some of the add-ons.

homelab,3c8xro,cooldude919,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:33:39 2015 UTC,"We are doing a sophos POC right now, i am having a hard time seeing how anyone would use it in a real enterprise environment over someone like fortinet/cisco.  Sophos UTM cant do the following:  Cant do true ipsec tunnels to non sophos devices, meaning crypto map style only, meaning no OSPF/routing protocol.  OSPF can only be done from RED Sophos to Sophos tunnels.  AV engine is either on or off, you cant control to/from what traffic gets passed through the AV engine.  IPS is snort with signatures from them, sophos doesnt even make their own signatures.  Not totally a bad thing, but in a 0-day thing they will be waiting on another vendor for an IPS release.  IPS subnets are put in a list, so ANY traffic destined for those subnets will be run through the IPS engine, meaning you cant have one source to the remote subnet run through the IPS and another source not run through the IPS.  Cant do dhcp reservations.  Firewall cant do zones or interface sets.  The firewall consists of basically one big numbered list, with traffic inspected one line item at a time for ALL traffic. Could inadvertently have a hit for traffic that you had no intention of affecting.  Sophos doesnt have their own OS, the UTM is just a linux server with all of their software on top.  If you are a linux power user that may be good for you, otherwise all base commands you run from root are linux.  BTW they force you to make private/public keys to even access root SSH ,because obvously once you get that access you have the keys to the kingdom.  If someone could somehow hack into it, they could do things to your traffic, run processes, etc, outside of the software operation and without your knowledge.   I keep finding out new crappy things every day pretty much.  On the upside the performance is good, and if you are small time with 1 office (or for home in this case) it may be a fit, but for big time stuff the limitations seem like a lot.  IMHO it seems a lot like pfsense with some improvements and a fancier front end."

homelab,3c5m09,linuxcsgobro,2,Sun Jul 5 01:07:48 2015 UTC,How long did it take to study and pass the RHCSA? Did you pass the version using RHEL 6 or 7? Any study materials you can recommend?
homelab,3c5m09,linuxcsgobro,6,Sun Jul 5 01:42:23 2015 UTC,"I spent close to 5 months on the RCHSA. I took much longer because I started studying for RHEL 6(which I highly advise you learn) and then switched to the RHEL 7 test. I was also derailed by a month learning Tomcat, JBoss, Apache, and Puppet.  I used the following resources:   RHCSA/ RHCE Red Hat Linux Certification by Michael Jang A Practical Guide to Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux by Mark G. Sobell  Linux Acadmey training Red Hat portal The Urban Penquin on YouTube Read the CertDepot blog Attend local Red Hat and Linux meetups Practiced all of the objectives listed multiple times."
homelab,3c5m09,varky,3,Sun Jul 5 02:05:21 2015 UTC,Nice job! I have the Michael Jang book for RHEL 6 and it's great. I will check out the other resources. I've seen Urban Penguin stuff before and really disliked all of it.
homelab,3c5m09,canhazraid,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:16:43 2015 UTC,"Bit different on my end, but I passed my RHEL6 RHCSA using pretty much just the Jang book and a bit of quizzing from my coworkers while I was preparing. I'm facing RHEL7 RHCE in a couple of months and I'll probably be going with a mix of cert depot, the RHCE portion of the Jang book (should still be fairly relevant) and endless quesitons :D"

homelab,3c5m09,commentsurfer,3,Sun Jul 5 01:21:10 2015 UTC,"I am always mixed when asked about recommending the Synology.   For someone without much IT knowledge, needs a datastore, and wants to do some multimedia it is an absolute recommendation.  For someone with a little bit of experience but wants to learn on their own I am 50/50 on the recommendation. If you have a family that wants to watch TV and use the media capability I would recommend it. Not having to worry about system administration has a high worth. Easy configuration also has a good price. If you are single or the device has no bearing on others in the household I would recommend against it favoring the individual learning the core technologies of how and why it works.  To the average homelab person, DIY, superuser, or system admin I would not recommend it. I won't get into the religion of ZFS but coming from a Solaris background I am huge fan of the filesystem. The system I own is limited to 6gb of RAM; not that I would use it, but given the cost($1400) I built my Avaton systems for hundreds less, have 36GB of ECC RAM, 8x hot swap ports, 6x gig-E, 8 cores on the cpu, and a total of 10 SATA ports internally. My potential is infinitely higher with a beige box build.   All of that said you really have to weigh your time vs potential. The Synology allows me to get up and running with NAS, CIFS, ISCSI and a slew of other technology that is point and click easy to install. I have maintenance for 3 years with excellent support. The system looks nice, runs quite, and is actually fun to admin.  And your last question, if I need to expand my storage which I will need within the next year, I do not plan on buying another Synology or the 12 bay expansion. I will go with a Norco case or something that will give me 24 bays, a low power Xeon, 64GB RAM, and multiple PCI-e slots."
homelab,3c5m09,Magnus919,0,Sun Jul 5 01:51:19 2015 UTC,Except that the synology doesn't protect you against bit flips.

It is nice now but was not so great the last many months.   It helps greatly if your employer contributes. Mine provided the Mac and Time Capsule. If you live in a good size city check around for decomm or off lease equipment. You really only need one machine, a few disks, 8GB RAM and you have enough compute power to setup a lab, study, and gain a certification. Once you go up in salary keep living the same life and invest the 'raise' in more equipment and time to study and go up another notch.   Try to stay in the same industry. I was foolish and chased hours which did not equal more money in my pocket even though I was making more money."

homelab,3c6bbr,its_safer_indoors,3,Sun Jul 5 11:32:02 2015 UTC,Yes.  You'll want to use WiFi analyzer or a similar app and check your frequency congestion in the area and place the ap appropriately.  Otherwise you'll get poor performance either way.

One of those think servers that go on sale all the time is likely much more powerful than these G5's and can be had for $200 - $300 USD. I'd at least look into the power draw if you have a killawatt or similar tool.   We don't all have money for new(er) stuff unfortunately. I am running an ML350 G5 totally fine.   I do everything on my workstation in VMware Workstation, I'm definitely not one of those guys on here that buys thousands of dollars of equipment to boast about e-peen and run like 5 VM's.

homelab,3c6cvf,darthn3ss,2,Sun Jul 5 20:12:45 2015 UTC,"I understand your point. But there is a difference between paying more for power every month than paying upfront $300 (and DDR3 ram is very expensive). I even considered upgrading to a Dell R710. But after I did some calculations it turned out it just is not worth it to spend $300 to save a bit on my electricity bill. On the other hand, I am only running one server, so that won't make much difference.

homelab,3c6cvf,seoyne,2,Sun Jul 5 21:32:07 2015 UTC,"Apparently HP is ok with there desktops running hot but quiet but there servers running chilled and loud AF.    1U servers have very small heat sinks, hot server grade components, lots of memory, and hot drives.  They tend to design for dual 95W cpu's and other components that generate 200-400 watts of heat.  The fans need to pull from the front through to the rear, and ensure there are no hot-zones inside the case. Your desktop on the otherhand probably pulls 100 watts, has twice the heatsink, and huge 120mm fans.  The DL360 G5 is also running horrible harpertown (E5400 series) Xeon's that were extremely inefficient and generate LOTS of heat.  This isn't HP deciding to make servers loud to offend you, its the necessity of the 1U server you bought.  Desktop-style servers are almost always quieter than their 1U, or even 2U counterparts.  If you want a quiet silent server, get a modern mini-tower machine based on Ivy Bridge/Haswell - The Lenovo TS140, HP Micro Server, etc."

It seems with this setup the airflow is more like an oven than a system to push a majority of the hot air out. Maybe limit the air in-flows to the front of the servers by closing the big gaps with panels on the front of the rack. Adding a fan at the bottom rear might be good too, alternatively maybe seal the bottom? Maybe I'm underestimating the 5x 120mm fans though."

When the internet goes down, the whole house complains so it's like managing a small datacenter only the bosses are your direct family and MUCH more aggressive!   For my actual test lab, I have no problems blowing a config out of the water, bringing up and down a connection 17 times an hour or installing and blowing away VMs like nothing, but the tradeoff is that it's all on used, old, hardware that's all mismatched and everywhere.

Mine has been running with an E3-1265L v2 (45W TDP) for over a year without issue. The last few months it has even been running in a fire resistant gun safe so the airflow is limited but it has kept cool just fine.

homelab,3bzxmx,expressadmin,2,Fri Jul 3 20:52:41 2015 UTC,"/u/bahwhateverr/ has it pretty close.  IT mode is HBA mode... so no RAID functionality at all, just presents the attached drives as standard drives (/dev/sda, /dev/sdb, etc).   IR mode is RAID mode so the drives are combined in various forms to create a RAID array that is then presented to the OS (so two drives in RAID1 and /dev/sda, or four drives in RAID10 as /dev/sda and so on).  My complaint stems from the process to convert from IR mode (which is the default for the cards in the OP and others from LSI/Avago) to the IT mode. You have to boot the computer into UEFI shell with a special command line utility for LSI under UEFI , then clear the firmware (pray that the power doesn't go off during this step or you brick the controller) and then flash the IT firmware on to the device."

homelab,3bzopl,kittens108,2,Sat Jul 4 00:08:26 2015 UTC,"HyperV and ESXi are both best of breed type 1 hypervisors.  HyperV is no more resource intensive than ESXi.  Windows takes up ~300mb of ram on clean boot, and VMware takes roughly the same.  VMware is a slightly smaller (~2GB?) install vs Windows (~4GB?).  If you do a core install, the two come out nearly identical in overhead.    HyperV is HyperV (you don't get any special HyperV features with the Data Center version you dont get from the free version).  For a homelab installation, running HyperV can be a bit more flexable in that any hardware with a Windows driver will generally work with HyperV (that shitty realtek network card, software raid, etc).  You can also share files natively from the host os into the guests (ie, share a USB disk with 4TB of movies over SMB into a Plex VM).   I know I can install Hyper-V in standalone vs server mode (or something like that), which is the best if I want to use it just as a hypervisor?    No idea what this means.  There is Windows HyperV Server (free, are you calling this standalone?) and Windows Server with a HyperV role (paid).  HyperV Server lacks additional  (ie, it cant be an active directory server, or a fax server).  Windows Server has additional roles.  To be clear, a Windows HyperV 2012 R2 and a Windows Server 2012 R2 server core with a HyperV role enabled are functionally identical.  Windows Server 2012 R2 can have additional features enabled on top of it.  You probably dont want to run Windows HyperV 2012 R2 if you have a full Windows license.  Its convenient to have a full GUI in a homelab and not need a second management PC.  As a side note -- Windows HyperV 2012 R2 makes a great free operating system if you can work around the limitations of server core. Guide   I mainly want to run linux VMs though, and I've read that there can be problems with memory and stuff, how problematic are these for the main linux distros?    All mainstream distributions on modern kernels support HyperV just fine.   And what are the features like vs ESXi?     Core features - you wont see a difference.  HyperV is a bit nicer in some regards.  You can use Powershell to script it (ESXi requires vCenter).  You can easily take backups (in VMware you need to hack around with GhettoVCB).  You have more flexable hardware support.  That being said, I prefer ESXi when I can run it."

One you decide to start paying for a hypervisor, because you want support, vCenter has more bells and whistles than Hyper-V right now, and there's more vCenter experience 'in the field'. You're going to pay more, especially if you use a lot of Windows VMs (where you can't beat Server 2012 R2 Datacenter  pricing) but you'll get something reliable that a lot of other people have run at scale.

ESXi in a whitebox (the term given to homemade esxi servers) can be hard to set up as missing drivers / unsupported hardware etc may cause problems VS windows plug-n-play. If you have a license for windows/hyper-v you can fully us all roles on that server VS you will sacrifice some ESXi functionality when you apply your free ESXi license. (n.b. I have not yet ever found myself missing anything in ESXi as the result of using the free license. The features it knocks out are really IMHO geared toward businesses with mulitple esxi servers) ... but it's still chopping off some functionality. With windows, you can actually use the windows installation as a server in its own right VS ESXi where you then need a separate VM for any server you want to run subsequently.   Its hard to say what you should go for. Personally, i went with ESXi because its lightweight and less resource intensive. Plus i'm a big nerd who get a perverse thrill out of doing stuff in the command line. Plus I think that the experience I get messing around with ESXi will be more valuable than JUST using Windows.

If your workstation is connected to your vlan 10 you could do something like this to access it directly:  set vlans vlan10-domain vlan-id 10  set vlans vlan10-domain l3-interface vlan.10  set interfaces vlan unit 10 family inet address 192.168.101.254/24  It sounds like you're connecting the physical management interface back to an access port on this same switch. If this is the only switch you have I wouldn't do that. I'd just setup a vlan.1 like my vlan.10 above.
homelab,3bzh4v,hankrearden,3,Fri Jul 3 15:06:06 2015 UTC,"I don't follow exactly what you're trying to do but inband management works fine.   You're correct, it seems I've managed to confuse myself. Looking now, it's just that the 4500, 6210 and 8200 switches which don't allow in-band management on the setup wizard. I watched a video where someone said that the EX2200 supports in-band but the C doesn't, didn't really seem to make much sense and I should have questioned it more, I think I just conflated that comment and the mentions on Juniper's site which apply only to higher end switches.  I'll have another crack at this tonight using in-band management and your suggestion, thank you."
homelab,3bzh4v,hankrearden,3,Fri Jul 3 15:25:45 2015 UTC,"I think the OP made more sense on a second read so I just wanted to make another suggestion.  It sounds like you want the 2200 to handle routing between your 3 vlans and the ERL will just be an edge device.  It also sounds like the ERL just has an interface on your VLAN 10.  I'd change that to a point to point.  The 2200 would be something like:  set interface ge-0/0/11.0 family inet address 192.168.254.1/30  and the ERL would be something like (haven't touched one in a while so this is loose syntax):  set interface ethernet eth0 address 192.168.254.2/30  And then the only route on your 2200 would be:  set routing-options static route 0.0.0.0/0 next-hop 192.168.254.2  And you need a return route on the ERL for the other networks.  To be honest OSPF is the easiest option here if you want to dive into that.  It's probably obvious but one thing to consider is that with the ERL acting only as an edge device you won't be able to use it to filter traffic between your vlans.  The 2200 does have some filtering options, though.  Anyway, just some thoughts in case you care."
homelab,3bzh4v,hankrearden,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:44:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks to your help, I've been able to getting it running as desired. Except for internet access on VLANs other than Domain (10), the one on which the ERL currently sits. Kind of a bummer for my previous setup of having my WAP's IP on VLAN 1 and the SSID going over VLAN 10, since it can't talk to Meraki's servers. I realise now that this was my problem before, whereas I assumed it was down to improper trunk configuration on the interface to which the WAP is connected.  And it looks like you beat me to the punch here, as I realised it was because the ERL doesn't know how to handle traffic on anything except the 192.168.101.0/25 subnet it's configured for, so the static route from 2200 -> ERL only works on VLAN 10. Obviously this kind of defeats the purpose of a static route in the first place, since I'm no further along than just having the devices on VLAN 10 pointed at the ERL directly. I managed to work out that's what the issue is, but had no idea how to go about making the ERL aware of the other VLANs so it can route back to them for WAN traffic. So thanks for the tip, if OSPF is easiest and will do the trick then I'll go with that. Would you have any tips as to where I could read up to better understand OSPF and how I'd go about implementing a route between ERL and 2200 using it?  Also, may I ask what the functional difference is between a point-to-point setup (which I'm not familiar with, as you may have guessed I'm sort of running before I can walk here) and simply having the ERL sit on one of the existing VLANs? And why you'd suggest the former over the latter? I'd really like to use the the ERL as an L2TP server, would running a point-to-point setup make this anymore difficult than my current setup?  I don't really need to filter traffic between VLANs at this stage and had considered that when moving from my old setup where the ERL handled VLANs, but thanks for the tip.  I really appreciate the help you've given, I've been going through a fair number of guides but asking questions directly is great as a sanity check and to help me understand where I'm going wrong."
homelab,3bzh4v,digilink,2,Mon Jul 6 20:42:37 2015 UTC,"I started to ninja-edit the OSPF stuff the other day. I think you're much better off making things work with static routes first.  If I'm hearing you right all you need to do is setup static routes on the ERL for the return traffic. And it sounds like you've reasoned it out. The ERL doesn't know how to get the return traffic back to things in vlan 1.  There's really only one place you can send that traffic, so on the ERL you'll do something like:  set protocols static route 192.168.100.0/24 next-hop 192.168.101.1  That should be the address of vlan.10 on your 2200. I'm just assuming you used .1 and you'll need to do the same thing for vlan 100 if you want return traffic to get back to it.  OSPF just makes all of this dynamic. You enable it on the ERL and the 2200 and they peer up and exchange information about the networks they know about so each device can dynamically learn how to reach different networks. If you add a new vlan on the 2200 it'll tell the ERL about it and you don't have to do anything.  I really do think you should make it work with statics first though.  The point to point might not actually buy you that much with what you're doing but a point to point connection moves the router into a different broadcast domain and isolates it from anything going on at layer 2 in your vlan 10. It prevents traffic from going around things just like you're currently doing with default gateways set to the ERL so you'll always know how your traffic will flow through your network. It makes things more portable in that you can re-ip your vlan 10 or move that network to a different device or anything like that without having to touch your ERL (ok, you'd have to update static routes until you get some kind of protocol running). If you do get things like OSPF or VRRP running it keeps all of that traffic between the two devices instead of (potentially) flooding it out all switch ports in that vlan. Etc, etc.  In short, it's a more efficient, secure, and stable design in the real world, at least."

There are so many robust options out there, and they can often do things that an off-the-shelf solution like Synology can't do, like ZFS (or, at least, it couldn't the last time I looked at them)."
homelab,3c0i8p,Nerdnub,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:27:00 2015 UTC,"The Synology is a nice piece of gear, particularly for the price, but the ability to only use 2.5"" disks might be pretty unattractive depending on what you intend to do with it.  It drives your $/GB up significantly compared to a solution built around 3.5"" bays.  But if you are more interested in speed than capacity and plan to use SSDs, then it might not matter.  Once you jump up to Synology's equivalent products but with 3.5"" bays (say 4+ or more bays, e.g. the DS414 non-slim version, which sells for $470), the price starts to go up to the point where building your own starts to look really attractive.  At least, that's my feeling.  Although my ongoing experience is that rolling your own is cheap if you are cool with purchasing used gear, much of which comes out of datacenters / server farms and is really loud.  I keep my gear in my basement so it doesn't matter, but if I was sleeping next to it, I'd probably not mess around with the required hacking to make it quiet and just buy more well-behaved stuff from the beginning.

homelab,3buubt,MonsterMufffin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:35:47 2015 UTC,If you do manage to mod it do let me know because it would be useful to use. I couldn't find anyway to quieten it down since it has one modular fan unit that if pulled out makes the PSU's go INSANE and when you plug it back in the PSUs calm down but the noise is the same as the fans are now on.  Having my rack in another location isn't an option for me unfortunatly. How loud is the MSA60?
homelab,3buubt,C4ples,2,Thu Jul 2 13:34:55 2015 UTC,"MSA60 is not ridiculous when it actually spins down. It's not something I'd want in my entertainment room, but home server area? (garage, back room, cellar etc) - yeah shouldn't be a problem. First few times I fired it up to make sure it works I was like F*** this is so loud. Then I jumped online and someone had the same issue, said after a few restarts it did what it should do and spun down. I tested mine - yep exactly the same. Took a little while, then when it spins down it's no louder than the DL380 which will be running it.  I've seen people mod the DL360 pretty easy. It had two rows of fans up front, and if you take one out it spins the PSU fan up as you've described with the MSA50, but if you jump the PWM cables from the fans left behind to the cables from the fans you've cut out, it thinks they're all there and PSU fans stay as normal. Something like that, you'd have to youtube it to see exactly what they did.  I'm hoping I can do something similar with the MSA50. Or possibly replace the cooling, but keep the fan module installed and tricked into thinking it's still powering a fan somehow, and just deal with the cooling in a more manageable fashion. I wonder if a simple resister would be enough to slow the fan but not make the PSU fan ramp up?"

I have also achieved my CCNA and am currently working on CCNA Security and CCNP.  What I would recommend for you is to install whichever operating system you feel most comfortable on the hardware itself. From there, run a type 2 hypervisor such as Virtalbox or VMWare Player / Workstation. I prefer Workstation, VMWare is a valuable technology to familiarize yourself with.   You can install operating systems on top of a hypervisor, called guest operating systems. The great thing about it is that you can experiment all you want with your guest OS's and it won't effect your host OS. Great for learning & breaking shit. If you go down the virtualization route, you will need a PC with at least 8GB of RAM, preferably 16GB.   For networking, I assume you will be enrolled in Cisco Networking Academy, where you will get access to Cisco Packet Tracer. To be honest, that's all you need for CCNA level labs. If you want to pursue further, download GNS3 and / or purchase real hardware. Bear in mind, in GNS3 you need to provide the Cisco IOS files otherwise it's useless. GNS3 also takes a lot longer to learn than Packer Tracer but it's far more powerful.   Any more questions - Just ask :-)"

The 64GB SSD is a waste of money and a sata port if you're wanting to use it as the OS drive. When FreeNAS boots, its loads into memory and runs from there. You would be much better off using a good quality 8GB+ flash drive and installing FreeNAS to that.     To go along with that, that case would only be able to hold 3 3.5"" drives, and your mobo would have an open SATA port. If you're OK with that, then go ahead. I, personally would be bothered that I had an extra SATA connection and couldn't use it for more storage space.     You could move it up to a Node 304 with the money you saved from the ssd."

It works the same as iDRAC on Dell servers.  Of course, if it's already configured, you're going to have fun getting into it, it could be on any ip range with any password!

I've never got a firm answer, but I'd imagine it's so that you can route the signal through switches and longer cabling so that you don't have to be right up next to the device to manage it through the serial port.  Edit Of course, I could be completely mistaken, and the whole purpose of the serial-to-RJ45 cable is so that you can make a serial connection (from the serial port on your PC) to the ethernet management port on the device. If your PC doesn't have a serial port (as most modern PCs don't), that USB-to-serial might work instead."

Let's say you've got a VPS with publicly-routable IP address a.b.c.d and a machine on your home network listening for HTTP connections on x.y.z.a:1234, and you want to be able to serve web pages to random people on the Internet.  On some machine in your home network (I'd put it on the firewall, but that's just me), run this command:  ssh -R 80:x.y.z.a:1234 a.b.c.d   As long as this program is running, people will be able to point their browsers to http://a.b.c.d and they'll see pages served from x.y.z.a:1234.  You could use cron (or daemontools or something else) to make sure it's always running.  One complication: you need to be root to bind to ports below 1024 on the VPS machine, which you'll probably want to do to forward the commonly-used ones (eg, 80).  To get around this, you could pop in some firewall mojo to translate port 80 to some unprivileged port that you can bind to with ssh -R.  Under no circumstances should you solve this problem by ssh'ing as root."

You may be better off running 2x 250GB in RAID1 to hit higher Read/Write speeds.  edit Just noticed the last comment which says you already bought a 250GB and 500GB.

Do you think it will still outperform in read/writes the 7200rpm SATA WD Red on the P410i controller of mine?  OR   I either get another SSD 500Gb and RAID1 them together? Or maybe get an upgrade RAID Card instead of running with the P410i ? ( any suggestions which one I should go with?)   Forgot to mention my p410i has the 512MB write cache WO (without) battery backup  HP P420 Raid controller would know 6GB/s with the SSDs?  http://pages.ebay.com/link/?nav=item.view&alt=web&id=321766800871&globalID=EBAY-ES
homelab,3bx0u6,egotrip21,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:25:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think it would still be 2x as fast as the WD Red as that appears to be rated at 150MB/s.  I'm not sure if upgrading to a p420 would help, I mean it is a faster card but I'm unsure of how the G6's drive backplane comes into play in regards to supporting SATA 3.0 (if it matters or not).  2x 500GB SSD would give you theoretical 600MB/s but with overhead it is probably a little less.  If you have interest in running a separate NAS in the future you could grab some cheap Brocade 1020 cards and do 10Gbit iSCSI over fiber to the NAS w/ your SSDs."

VMware is extremely efficient as a hypervisor and is generally ~99% as efficient as running servers bare metal in terms of disk throughput and such.  (Feel free to look at the VMware benchmarks).  Software RAID1 takes nearly no CPU on a modern machine (ie, <2%).  Running software RAID onto VMDK's is basically a pass-through operation to the disks.  You may see ~1% performance degradation per VMDK.  As the VMDK's are on different disks, you will see an aggregate 1% performance impact, and <2% increase in CPU.

You can get it at Grainger or most Home Depots.    What I'd probably do is feed string through the conduit, then lay it in the trench, and then use the string to pull the cables through.  (Some conduit may come with a pull line or tape already inside it.)  If you have never worked with fiber before, be very careful of the bend radii as you pull it.  You can destroy it pretty easily if you are not careful!  I'd have the conduit come up out of the ground and into some sort of junction box on either end, and then into the house.  If you need 120V power I would use direct-burial cable with some stubs of rigid conduit on either end of the trench where it comes up out of the ground.  There are lots of tutorials online on how to run underground electric cable (for  yard lighting and such).   In most places it's fine to have it share the same trench as low-voltage wiring, just not the same conduit.  As long as you are confident that there's nothing in the area where you're digging, you might want to consider renting a trench-digging machine.  It will save you a ton of backbreaking digging and should be pretty cheap from Sunbelt or a similar tool-rental place.

I've also read forum posts stating that others have had success using 5 and 2.4 GHz units through small patches of dense foliage. Snow and rain should not be an issue.  In general, when trying to penetrate trees, the lower the frequency the better, so you may want to consider 2.4 GHz or even 900 MHz radios if the trees are very heavy instead of 5 GHz.

The flexible conduit is the stuff you see poking out of the ground near power poles pretty frequently... it's usually bright orange.  The right way to do things is to put the power cable in a separate conduit from the data wires, or just use direct-burial power cable and put it outside the conduit.  If that wasn't feasible, I'd probably look into doing POE over some copper Ethernet cable.  Worst case, you could run 120V alongside the fiber (probably not exactly to code but not rampantly unsafe and there's no EM interference issue with fiber), but not alongside copper cable."
homelab,3bvi2p,tanuki94,3,Thu Jul 2 14:43:00 2015 UTC,"That was 6"" bend radius, not 6"" conduit diameter....  I did something slightly similar this spring to run a hanging basket sprinker system feed line about 120' around the fenceline.  Basically slit trenched it and used 3/4"" PVC conduit.  The bend radius at the corners definitely was a pain to deal with, otherwise pretty straightforward.   Definitely rent a trench machine if you're talking 500' and I suspect it's law in your area to get the utilitiy company to come out (free service) to mark where existing cables etc. are before you start digging."
homelab,3bvqzh,PsycoCarrot,3,Thu Jul 2 15:28:03 2015 UTC,While I can't recommend specific hardware I will challenge their throughput/hardware.  I ran their utm up on one of their email filter alliances (dual core 1.8ghz and 2gb ram). Once multiple blades where enabled the interface was unusable let alone meet the quoted throughput speeds.  Based on my experience I think the throughput speeds are for the firewall blade only and the more you enable the more hardware you should throw at it (same as pfsense with ips packages etc).  I would work off 4gb ram as a minimum and a newer dual core processor with aes-ni support.
homelab,3bvqzh,127b,3,Thu Jul 2 21:44:37 2015 UTC,"I'm in agreement here. Firewall throughput speeds, unless they specifically list what features are enabled for those speeds, are always as feature-free as possible. They are ""maximums"" and thus adding more features will always reduce your throughput from those numbers."

For clarity: Can you post a screenshot/photo of the status in the BIOS?  Normally a broken mirror should be importable, and it should rebuild in the background. If that is not possible, I would just put in a temporary boot-disk/USB with Linux and install MegaCli so you can get a better overview of the status than using the horrible BIOS UI.

True starting over is not too hard, that is one of the points of a home lab no pesky SLA or management to answer to about uptime or what servers are running or not allowing us to change and test things at a rapid pace. But what about if you could send a magical little note to when you were just starting your home lab? Just a little question asking what other people's ""greener pastures"" / ""Hindsight is 20/20"" for their home lab might look like.  I admit that although I would change a few things with what I know now, I probably wouldn't send that note (or I would change it to stock/lottery numbers...) because experience and failure is important."

There are some 24GB supermicro 2u's on eBay for $1k, and some Dell R610's for $1k.  The next bump up is probably a Intel Xeon E5-1660 v3, which is $1k on eBay for the CPU alone (32GB ram max), a TS140 could run it for $250, so ~$1250 for 14,000 CPU score, single CPU.  An ES E5 would then be next cheapest.   e5-2600 v2   A single e5-2600 is ~9700, are you sure even dual CPU this meets your requirement?

There are fan mods available on the internet, and i was thinking about swapping fans completely to see about saving some electricty.

But my opinion is tower servers just aren't as powerful as rack servers. Let's say you bought a brand new tower server and a old 2950 for the same price, the 2950 will win every time except for power consumption.   /u/tommybr4 sells this server for $215  http://tommybr4.com/dell-poweredge-2950-iii-with-2x-2-50ghz-quad-core-16gb-ram-4x-146gb-10k-sas-2-5-perc-5-i-2x-emulex-lpe11002-dual-port/  And newegg sells this server for $229  http://m.newegg.com/Product/index?itemnumber=N82E16859106529  Comparing these the only drawback to the 2950 is the noise and power consumption.

With that said, we sell tower servers that are usually purchased for a small business to run simple VM's. I can understand both sides of racks vs towers, but it always comes down to personal preference. To me, hardware is hardware.. but the person that controls the hardware is what makes it special."

homelab,3bt1zd,crankysysadmin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:18:44 2015 UTC,"/r/homelab is for people who have a home...lab. Like the kind of lab a company will have to test deployments and changes, as well as for training and tinkering...except in a home. This is why it splintered off from /r/sysadmin. Yes, I am actually a big proponent of taking the old toss-off desktops that you can pick up for free when people upgrade but the reality is that there's plenty of reasons for people to have rackmount gear in a homelab.  Lately, /r/homelab has had a lot of stuff that really isn't homelab related...it's become less about setting up things to either be a more proficient sysadmin or to simply experiment with new software when your job isn't on the line if it goes totally sideways. For those people, who are here for help getting their FreeNAS Jailed PLEX/XBMC/CouchPotato servers up and running, you're absolutely right that the rackmount gear is pointless. Then again, those people often aren't also reading /r/sysadmin for which windows patches each month will break their entire corporate infrastructure when they get deployed to workstations.  Of course, none of that changes the fact that you are absolutely correct that the OP doesn't want this set in particular...but that's far more due to the antiquity of the equipment than it is whether or not they are rack mountable or former enterprise gear. You wouldn't want a desktop PC from this far back either."
homelab,3bt1zd,swisssguy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:56:15 2015 UTC,"The thing is, you don't learn more by using a rack mounted server. I think people believe this since they feel they have to get hands on experience with rack mounted gear for their careers.  When you work in an enterprise environment you may never even see your servers. They could be in other states. They will be racked by cheaper employees who live in the data center and rack and stack equipment.  The money is in the software, design, architecture and project management.  You get too many people on here who get all the rack mount gear, spend a small fortune on it, and what they actually set up and configure in this environment is incredibly simplistic.  A single desktop machine with 32 gigs of RAM can actually be a far more complex environment in a home lab than having a whole rack full of 7 year old servers.   Most rackmount gear is so loud that even if you stick it in your basement you're probably going to hear it in the whole house."
homelab,3bt1zd,crankysysadmin,2,Thu Jul 2 00:59:45 2015 UTC,Understood. Perhaps I'll just read and research a little more.
homelab,3bt1zd,swisssguy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:10:04 2015 UTC,"I do not outright disagree with you, however I spent less on my two PE2950s (That are admittedly currently not in use due to being an apartment dweller) than I would on just the memory alone for that 32GB of ram desktop. On the other hand, my current homelab is a pair of Core2-Duos with 8GB of ram each, so I fully get what you're saying.  Nobody needs antique rackmount servers unless they like collecting big iron, but my homelab is pretty damn restrictive with 4cpu cores and 16gb of ram between both hosts. Given that just one of my 2950's more than doubles that, I miss those damn things. Had I not gotten my current lab for free, I'm not sure what I would be doing however. Tons of people on this site recommend things like TS140s and TS440s and all sorts of other things, and yeah I prefer the quiet towers to the noisy rack mounts...but the value of the rackmounts for capacity to dollar is pretty strong. Yeah, power draw is a thing, especially as you get into older servers...but again,  I could drop both desktops (and realistically another two if I had more of them) to run one PE2950 and save on power by a fair bit. Yeah, my 2950IIs are DDR2 memory, and older Xeons, however my homelab is not processor intensive, and neither of those are bottlenecks compared to my current use of commodity consumer SATA drives versus the SAS15ks that I got for ridiculously cheap with the 2950s. The 2950s actually handle everything I throw at them far and away better than the current desktops I have running everything...but you're right, the reason why I'm using desktops is because those PE2950s are loud. I knew what I was buying, and at the time had somewhere for them. That's where we come in, not just to shunt ideas off, but to educate and inform the people who are coming here who want to ask legitimate questions besides ""hey, someone tell me step by step how to set up my plex and torrentbox for my...'homelab.'"" PE2950IIs, if set to the lower fan mode and after their jet-turbine level startup, actually aren't terrible. You can easily hold a conversation over the noise while standing right next to them, if you put them in another room they are no more of a drone than a small house fan. Does that work for everyone? No. Does it work for some, and give them an opportunity to have a homelab that isn't a pair of shoeboxes like mine? Yes. Hell, if I'd had to buy those shoeboxes I would have spent at least as much, if not more, than I did on my 2950s, to get less."

The AMD uses similar power at idle and much lower power at load than the pentium,  its cheaper, both boards have the same RAM limitations (16GB), they are both more than enough to handle your needs that you laid out.     There is no compelling reason to choose the pentium over the 5350.     Also, if you would be interested in a smaller case, the Cooler Master elite 110 can hold 3 3.5"" (desktop sized) drives and a 2.5"" (ssd/laptop) drive in a much smaller, cheaper package.

homelab,3bth2g,THECOACH0742,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:02:39 2015 UTC,"There is no doubt that the Pentium is a more powerful processor. It really comes down to what is more important to you, cost or power. The Pentium will be more expensive to operate along with a higher initial cost, while the 5350 will be very energy efficient at load, cheaper startup costs, but will be a bit slower at difficult tasks.     To be honest, if you are wanting to do these difficult tasks very often, you would be better off saving up some more money or settling for a larger form factor like the TS140/TS440."

OP: Why are you running these SAT solvers on a box that you are shoestringing to be a torrent slave? When you restrict your budget so dramatically, you should focus on one task, or you will end up with a product that does ~nothing~ you ask of it terribly well.

homelab,3bojo0,cuddlychops06,9,Tue Jun 30 23:51:57 2015 UTC,"openWRT or ddWRT unlock the router's full potential.  Settings get so granular as controlling the amount of power pushed to the antenna (essentially overclocking/extending the range of your antenna).  it is a linux distribution for your router with a very nice front-end.  A very useful feature is using DNSmasq instead of a generic DHCP server.  DNSmasq is a DNS/DHCP server.  best way to explain it: lets say your phone (android-Xadf98sd) connects to your wifi and leases a DHCP.  not only does DNSmasq lease it an IP to get it on your network but it also updates the DNS record mapping android-Xadf98sd to that IP for the duration of the lease.  The way I had mine set up was as a dumb AP.  basically you assign an IP address to the router and bridge the LAN (switch) interface with the WiFi radio to provide a ""media-converter"" from wifi to your hard-line network.  Feel free to PM me for more info.  I'm always happy to help"
homelab,3bojo0,EspoNation,7,Wed Jul 1 00:38:06 2015 UTC,"openWRT; Tomato; DD-WRT are all third party OS you can flash on supported home routers, they will give you more network options to play with then your stock firmware. For example you can setup VPN access, configure wifi power output, wireless repeaters, custom routing. I have also heard they are more stable then the stock firmware, and a lot of the stock firmware does not get updates at all so the routers turn into huge security holes. third Party firmware is better taken care of is believe.

homelab,3bojo0,MrElectroman3,2,Wed Jul 1 07:39:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, of course! I had a gig last year to build a Wifi controlled LED dress. There's a write-up in this post.  Using wifi in this kind of situation is a bit risky because it can drop out, especially with realtime data. I figured the best way to ensure it working was to put some directional antennae on an AP, cover the stage with it and crank up the transmit power so it would stomp over any competing signal. It worked perfectly.  To be honest the LCD/LED displays were not totally necessary, but I wanted it to look cool next to all the groovy looking gear that you normally find backstage at these things. My normal projects are usually tangles of wire and I thought it was high time for a bit of ""professionalism""  Here is the front and back. The feet from the router are screwed down to two pieces of wood and a couple of bungees hold it in place.   The antennae are both 10dBi panels SPAPG10 from superpass.  Here it is with the router removed. The AP was at the end of a long ethernet cable. I fed 19V in at the other end over the blue and brown pair in a traditional ghetto PoE style. The red board is a buck converter which generates the 12V supply for the Linksys.  The voltmeters measure the voltage on the end of the cable, and the output of the converter.  Guts There is another buck converter (top left) to provide the 5V for the microcontroller and LCD. The microcontroller reads the output of the second serial port of the Linksys, which is running this script on startup:  while true; do  echo -n ""1"" > /dev/cua/1  nvram get wl0_ssid > /dev/cua/1  echo -n ""2"" > /dev/cua/1  nvram get lan_ipaddr > /dev/cua/1  sleep 10 done   Every line the microcontroller receives that begins with a ""1"" gets put on the top half of the LCD, lines beginning with a ""2"" go on the bottom. The LCD is connected with this plug. Simple, but it works. (these things always look terrible in photographs)."

Licensing is also done by CPU, so you can't buy 1 Datacenter license, and spin up 100 VMs across 3 physical machines. Each license covers 2 physical CPUs, so a single Datacenter license lets you use unlimited VMs across the same host server.

When we set it up, we didn't name the controller ""Unifi"" we gave it a name based on our internal naming scheme.

I'm glad to know that I'm not the only one. I enjoy the problem solving and creative aspect of this. Just this past week I installed FreeBSD 10.1 on a Raspberry Pi. It was problem after problem, but it was tons of fun. The pkg script included does not work, I don't think there are binaries for ARM pre-compiled actually, so I began making ports. Kept running out of space, then realized that the default install barely used half of the SD cards capacity. I learned how to resize the partitions, learned that FreeBSD uses gpart, learned that you could resize a live system -- effin cool!. Learned that compiling on a Pi is godawfully slow and tried to setup distcc but was a little burned out at that point. It's something I'll pick up and try again soon. All in all this took me 3-4 days spread out, several hours of combined time but it was fun.   What makes me scratch my head is seeing someone who would post what they did with their RPi running FreeBSD and it's got 10 servers and all this complex stuff. I just wonder how wtf? Did he not run into the same issues I did?   Maybe I'm psyching myself out because by seeing people's end results, blog posts, and finished setups it makes it seemed like they put it all together with no difficulty whatsoever."

Computer's and the things they run/operate are simple - once you involve the human element is where things get dicey. My best recommendation for whenever you're stumped on something is to get up from the computer ( :'( ), walk away from it. 15 minutes, 30 minutes, hour, whatever it takes.

homelab,3bomp8,PsycoCarrot,2,Thu Jul 2 05:53:20 2015 UTC,"I am in a similar place - late 20's, switching career to IT, trying to find a bottom job and work my way up, to the eventual goal of Linux admin. I have a decent bit of self-taught experience in CentOS 6. I am taking Linux courses at my local community college to legitimize my experience on my resume, but otherwise I have no relevant certs. My lab has less than 10 VMs, no VLANs (yet).  I am constantly learning and hitting issues. I am recently switching my homelab from ESXi to qemu-KVM, and that learning process has been rewarding. As I've been rebuilding my VMs and services, I've been taking a look into bettering them from their previous iteration ie better security, more optimized, more efficient workflow, alternative software.   In doing so, I have hit several roadblocks. However, I am the type that loves puzzles and solving problems, so when I figure out the fix to whatever issue I am having, it's like an adrenaline rush and it gives me so much motivation to learn more.   I, like you, have the ""20 mins 2 days"" thing. I tend to try to build things ""right"" in their original build, so lots of those little ""$SERVICE in 5 minutes!"" blog posts are pretty useless to me, because the goal of many of them is simply ""Does it work?"". The first time I built my DNS server, it took me like 6 days to finally hash out all the issues I encountered (ended up being a config issue). Then, upon the rebuild, I aced the config file, but I got stuck on something else for a few hours. Eventually it worked, though.  Answer to your questions:  1 - I started using Ubuntu in 2011 on my laptop, but that only lasted for a few weeks. I ran an Arch desktop for about 3 months in 2013, and I started my homelab (solely CentOS VMs) in early 2014.  2 - I don't have an IT job yet, but I am actively searching  3 - I hit some issue almost every time I tackle a new project. Depending on how verbose the errors are and what kind of Google results I can get, anywhere from 10 mins to a week. Sometimes, it's some really stupid shit (I thought my DNS server was broken cuz I couldn't ping amazon.com - turns out amazon blackholes pings and my DNS server was fine!).   However, more importantly than running into issues and becoming stuck/frustrated, is overcoming those issues. That kind of learning, that feeling of ""I want this!"", hitting a wall and eventually figuring it out, teaches so deeply that you are unlikely to ever forget how you solved it.   You just gotta keep solving those problems, and the knowledge will come. You just gotta keep that passion for learning and expanding, and you will go far."

I've held an actual IT job for about 3 years, but I've done a pretty wide range of stuff and I've been doing things on a hobby level for quite a while before that, since before I started college.  With Linux I mostly stick to tutorials and don't tend to get stuck much, but back when I was really getting into Windows stuff I managed to break things pretty spectacularly.

Computers were always my interest, from when I was about 13, and got my first computer, they fascinated me. I recall fixing Windows 95 at home after my parents were forced to shell out $100 to get a computer reformatted. I decided that I didn't want them to have to pay someone to fix their PC anymore.   Linux, my first exposure to linux was around the age of 15-16 years old. It was Slackware, and was very dirty and messy, which is exactly what I needed. I have faint memories of kernel rebuilds and figuring our iptables to use this thing as my router. I ran an IRC server, LAMP server, and gave people shell access. It's funny how this hobby empowered my career later in life because I gained valuable linux experience. I do work in IT. I started right after high school in 04 by working in retail computer sales at a computer store. I then transferred to their shipping department, and then the service department. Eventually I got fired and got hired by another company as a Network and Surveillance specialist - which was a joke because I didn't even know what a VLAN was at that point. I eventually quit and went on to start my own computer store, which I subsequently sold and now I work as an IT admin. I get stuck daily, at work and home.

Hardest part of it all is just getting someone to give you a chance.  I've been using Linux for the past 3+ years actively while playing with it on/off for the past 11ish.  By using, I mean maintaining a personal very stable Linux file server and some times helping a friend build one for themselves.  If you want a Linux job, learn HA-cluster virtualization once you're done with your initial expedition of setting up a regular Linux server.  My biggest issue with my homelab has been documentation.  I look up a guide, and start to follow it.  3/4 of the way through, I realize that whatever package worked with this before is either outdated resulting in everything breaking, or it's removed from the repository.  These issues usually are the consequence of not having the same version of Linux as the guide, or the guide having some backwards way of doing things resulting in having to reinstall the OS since the package manager is now broken or giving up on the project all together.  It foolishly wasn't until I was on the Unix team when I started to read the man pages.  Picking apart the commands and figuring out what they're doing instead of blindly copy-pasting will save you so much time and heartache.  I now look at a guide, see what packages the guy is using to get the result I want and go read the man pages.  Usually at that point I'm ready to build it my way and usually end up with a more secure box since I write firewall rules instead of just turning it off like some guide said.  My current challenge is reading through DRBD, Xen, Corosync and Heartbeat documentation.  I am trying to build a cluster like the ones we service at work.  Their way of doing things is so screwy and I think I can do it better.  My lead told me that he was unable to replicate most of our common cluster issues when he was trying to.  Sometimes you can't replicate issues in the lab that happen in the field, but just remember, while you're trying to, you're learning a ton.  I get stuck all the time.  Sometimes you have an idea that should work and can't find any documentation on how to do it.  Go read the Man page.  There have been many times where I've found I can't do what I want because the software I expect to use doesn't have the capability.  I'm learning that with my cluster...

Then again, something to keep in mind as far as power goes, as /u/fthiss points out it'd idle around 140w...which is actually only a bit more than two fairly standard incandescent bulbs also running 24/7.

Just a quick power consumption estimate says that system will draw about 140W at idle with a single 7.2K SATA drive which comes out to a monthly cost of almost $15 to run that as a router if your power rate is around the national average of $.14/kWh.  So I would either go with a different solution or bump up your budget a bit and build a low powered system since your yearly cost to run the R300 is going to be about $180.  I recently posted about my Mini-ITX Sophos UTM build which only draws about 12W under full load, see https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/39lnmi/thin_miniitx_router_build_for_sophos_utm/"

With no moving parts on this thing you could easily just mount it to a piece of wood, or nothing.  I just like the Silverstone for its functionality and aesthetics.  This brings your total build cost to $259 and with a power savings of roughly $14/month the ROI give a break even point around 8 months, after that you are saving money over using the R300."

Your routers will be rather underwhelming, feature-wise, compared to even a basic pfsense box, edgerouter, etc.  Honestly, I'd get the cheapest cisco switches and routers you can find, you don't need modern gear for your CCNA. Then buy 1 or 2 nice (non-cisco) gigabit managed switches and an edgerouter or just a pfsense box.

Hyper-V is also one you're quite likely to run in to at places that don't want or need to pay for the extra features of VMWare. If you're a Windows admin, some experience with Hyper-V is a good thing to have under your belt.

I think both are absolutely worth learning, but from a career standpoint I'd probably recommend getting a grip of VMWare first, partly since you don't need an existing Windows environment to effectively manage it, like you do with Hyper-V. And especially if you're looking to do things of a wider scope than Windows alone. Though the nice thing is you don't really have to choose as long as you have even a basic machine lying around to use as a Hyper-V host. I'm running mine on a first gen i3 with 8GB of RAM, picked that machine up for free and it's doing perfectly well as a learning tool."

There is no web services API for standalone ESXi nodes.  VMware ESXi has a series of command line tools that allow you to fully manage the server.    If you want to learn based on getting a job, I would look at Windows/ESX, or Linux/KVM (not Proxmox).  HyperV and Xen have smaller market share -- not to say they aren't in use -- just less so than VMware."

They have hundreds of local VAR's that can support our build, and all of our major hardware vendors are certified on their platform (HP/Dell/Supermicro).  Our storage is supported by ESXi/HyperV -- even a QNAP/Synology.  Now you want to go on vacation, and not take a pager.  No one can stand in to support you.  Dell wont talk about it.

homelab,3bnejo,vinceskahan,2,Thu Jul 2 01:48:16 2015 UTC,"Just before you spend all your time battling it, why is ESXi ideally your hypervisor ?  It has a maze of twisty little vProducts to figure out.  It wants a Windows box to manage it.  It's obfuscated as anything compared to the other options.  But yes it works and it's lightweight on the server if you have enough hardware.  If you're a software dev, you could easily spin up on ansible as a lightweight provisioning tool.  For virtualization I'd suggest centos7 with qemu-kvm - very easy to spin up/clone/destroy VMs from the commandline.   Very low hurdles toward being productive enough to concentrate on what you want to 'do' with the boxes rather than battling making them appear in the first place.  Then again, if you're a software dev person, I'd suggest you bootup centos7 on your server and use vagrant and docker on that.  Very very simple to provision stuff that way.  Again, if you use ansible everywhere for your DevOps tool you can run those playbooks against real computers, VMs, whatever.  Pretty slick stuff."
homelab,3bnejo,Gotxi,2,Tue Jun 30 21:05:01 2015 UTC,"VMware is the company that has more features in virtualization but they are not free.  You can install ESXI as your hypervisor and you can do one of these 3 options with zero budget:  1) Use free license: Just request yours in ""my vmware"" website. In 6.0 free license only allows you ""Up to 8-way virtual SMP"", and nothing more. Basically you can create Vm's and do basic stuff with them (power, reset, install vmware tools, resource pools...)  2) Use evaluation license: For 60 days you can evaluate all features ESXI offers you all of this. Since it's a home lab and not for production, you can reset your evaluation license deleting some files and restarting a service (google how to do that, it's easy). You can even do a cron task every 59 days to do this automatically for you so you have all complete features always.  3) Register it with a generated serial number. There are various vsphere 6.0 keygens on the internet, you can search for them. I think it's the worst option, but it is an option.  If you are not comfortable with none of the options above, try other free hypervisors with more features like proxmox (KVM), hyper-v server or Xenserver / XCP).  And yes, you will need a windows box to manage your ESXI host with the legacy client (asumming you are not installing vcenter)"

The shelf life of a cold backup on tape is still FAR superior to any HDD/Optical disk out there.   The biggest problem with ""powered off"" backups is of course the  degradation of data. I have seen drives that have been powered off for more than a year degrade enough to make a backup unusable.  Although tapes do degrade, they are less susceptible to the rot seen on Hard drive platters/flash drives. If you think that a solid state drive is safe, maybe investigate reliability when there is no ""maintenance charge"" on the drive - let's just say it is concerning.  So as for a backup plan, it's really a case of getting a tape drive, and firing up your favorite backup software (there are PLENTY around). Make sure you have enough tapes (depending on your plan, daily/weekly/monthly rotations), and schedule the backup to run when best you see fit."

homelab,3bonlf,DStoo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:45:15 2015 UTC,"Once upon a time, tape backups had a cost-per-GB (well, more like cost-per-MB) advantage over spinning disks.  That is not really the case anymore. The cheapest LTO3 tapes I can find are around $30 for 400GB; you can get a 4TB HDD for $150, or about half the price per GB.  So, in pure cost terms, the argument is not really there.  In the big-corp world, the (financial) argument for tape revolves around the cost of having the tapes sit on shelves (free) vs. having a drive in a nearline array (electricity, wear and tear, etc.).  So if you are Verizon or something, storing ridiculous amounts of billing data and probably never retrieving most of it, and you just want to be able to store it cheaply... it can kinda make sense.  Kinda.  They're not big sellers these days from what I've seen.  In a homelab, if you just wanted to play with one, sure why the hell not.  They're not terribly expensive to pick up and although I haven't played with the latest LTO generation, older ones used to work fine under Linux with stock tools (e.g. ""mtx"").  If you want to get experience that's applicable to larger installations, try to get a tape library rather than just a single drive.  Scripting the library / tape-changer system is where things really get interesting."

I was just saying LTO6 is considerably cheaper than disk.    Now we are discussing the drive as a factor?  Thats just an offset.  Going with something a little nicer, a 4 TB WD Red Pro is $219.  http://i.imgur.com/gXWpign.png  Tape is cheaper than disk for volumes over 50TB of storage.  Additionally you would probably use a tape robot with barcoding such that your backup software knows what media you need inserted.    So in the big-corp world tapes are used because mounting/unmounting is considerably more risky than mounting/unmounting tapes.  Robots exists for tapes that allow very large backup jobs, and extremely large inventory of tapes.  A large robot can have thousands of tapes online to pull from.  50TB isn't that much backup media.  A simple grandfather, father, son rotation with 4 weeklies, 4 months, and 4 years would consume ($data/2.5) x 16 worth of tape, so 7.8TB of data = 50TB of tape."

That cost me $125/yr to store all that.  I didn't have to pay electric in there.  Now between the family photos, family videos, music, ebooks, and scanned documents I have a few TB.

homelab,3bml64,HaliFan,2,Tue Jun 30 13:01:48 2015 UTC,"So basically it's a smart cache card or similar to that of a hybrid SSD/HDD (SSHD). Problem is that in a VMware ESXi environment the size of the VMDK files would be probably too large to store in the hot-cache (SSD). You would probably see no performance benefit when using this on VMware ESXi host as primary VM storage, and it's not HCL approved so I would imagine the card may not even get detected/usable by VMware without some wizardry.   Again this would be due to how the caching algorithm is a file-level / OS level on the HyperDuo card. Cool concept, but in reality is a bust."

homelab,3bml64,phantom_eight,2,Wed Jul 1 01:35:25 2015 UTC,"I bought a HyperDuo card a few years back and it required a Windows service to run in the background in order to monitor and then cache your most used stuff.   I'm not sure how well it would work in your application.  I thought it kind of sucked and I'm pretty sure it locked up/bricked my SSD, even though it was a crappy OCZ Vertex Plus.  I went looking for the card in my desk and my ""work shop"" in the basement, but between my two year old being the classic two year old at the moment and other non-sense going on... I've given up looking for now.  I wanted to share the model number, it had a Marvel chipset and used Marvel drivers and software.  If you want to seriously cache stuff and you are using Windows as a platform, Primocache is my current favorite.  Not sure what OS your Minecraft server runs on.... but if it's Windows, you can probably run Primocache inside a Windows VM on ESXi.    http://www.romexsoftware.com/en-us/primo-cache/index.html  You can straight up devote RAM as a Level 1 cache source if you want.  Then have SSD as Level 2 cache on top of that.   I actually use it on Server 2012 with Hyper-V, with 8GB of RAM set asside as cache and it gives all of my VM's SSD like speed even though they are on a RAID5 Hard Disk array."

homelab,3bnnze,_tufan_,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:55:57 2015 UTC,"You don't need a managed switch to use virtual machines. It can be as simple as sharing the same network as your host, or as complex as you want. You'll have to determine that based on your need. If your VMs sit on a different network segment than your host, then yes, you'll need something to perform routing between the two if you want them to talk."
homelab,3bnnze,geoffala,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:30:29 2015 UTC,"With a VMware vSwitch you don't need to manage the VM network to much extent.  Just create a virtual machine network with no vlan configured (0) and your VM's will have open communication with your router. Your router should be configured as the default gateway. You can turn off DHCP on your router and enable it on your AD server, or keep it running on the router (up to you).   If your router does not support VLANs/tagging then you won't be able to use VLANs. You can create a VM network with a VLAN but it will essentially be a black-hole / isolated network since your router won't do VLAN tagging. So the VMs on the VLAN would only be able to talk to each other."
homelab,3bnnze,Apoclypse,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:32:51 2015 UTC,I think I got it now.  Here is how my vSwitch looks (basically default) http://i.imgur.com/N4cxyJd.jpg  Could I run vm with pfsense and have it be my router?  That way I don't have to worry about my router config if I get a new model or change ISPs?  Also use it as a learning tool.  If I did that how would my switch have to look?  Do I have a switch with 1 VM (pfsense) and another switch with the rest of my VMs that connect to that first switch?
homelab,3bnnze,someguy866,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:19:52 2015 UTC,"On the pfsense VM you will need two vNICs. One of the vNICs will be assigned to your existing vswitch (vswitch0) and the other will need to be connected to a new vswitch, lets say vswitch1. The vNIC on pfsense assigned to vswitch0 will be your LAN facing interface. The other vNIC on pfsense will be assigned to the new vswitch1 and is your WAN facing interface. vSwitch1 will then plug into you modem. If you have a combo modem/router from you ISP you will need to look up how to set it into bridge mode so you are not double nat'd and pfsense gets a public ip on its WAN interface. Also if you are using a wireless router you will need to look up how to turn into a wireless access point (WAP) since pfsense is handling all routing functions.

A good example of this is using it to analyze Apache web traffic logs to see if you are getting hit by one particular IP, or a specific country at certain times of day.  I linked to that page, as it gives a good description of what each competent component does, and also there is links to Shield (Security) and Watcher (Alerting).

I think there is room to improve the state of logging, such that the data could be made easily parsed for gathering and analysis. As it stands syslog lacks a lot of structure that I think could improve the usability of the data commonly associated with it.

Sometimes you might have dual-band capable clients sitting on the 2.4 band but if your neighborhood isn't overloading 2.4 then this often doesn't matter.  I deployed 5 dual-band APs for a network spread across 2 houses on the same street (a single layer 2 network).  This means clients see 10 radios if they stand at the right spot.  I have them all on the same SSID and it just works and is very easy for everyone to use and understand.  Clients connect to whatever they can see.

homelab,3bjl5o,buildsrc,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:11:34 2015 UTC,"Your CPU should be fine for a single plex stream, maybe two depending on the bit rates.   I would look at the TS140 also, you can pick ECC ram up for cheap on Amazon UK. 16GB Kingston Value ECC is £111 last time I checked.   For the OS it depends what you want to run, If you want to run a Hypervisor for Virtual Machines you could take a look at Proxmox or VMware ESXi.   If your familiar with Linux I'd run Proxmox, it really is great. If you want to run Windows VM's, I'm not sure as I have not use Windows on Proxmox although I know it will run on there in KVM for sure.   If you just want a simple NAS to do all that you described I'd recommend FreeNAS, You can run plex, Transmission for torrents and owncloud for your files.  For remote access I'd just setup a VPN Server at your house and then connect to that when you need."
homelab,3bkl8k,ianc1215,5,Tue Jun 30 00:01:04 2015 UTC,"DL380 and R710 are both best of class 2U servers.  You are comparing a Mercedes to a BMW.  The biggest differences are from the manufacturer while they are under warranty.  Dell runs rebranded LSI cards as PERC controllers.  The PERC6/7 have a 2TB disk limit.  Im not aware of an R710 that allows more than 8 disks, but it may exist.  The P410i cards in many older DL380's will leave the server in a warn status with non certified disks, and dont support all SSD's.  Kinda annoying.   We support hundreds of both -- and with a licensed DRAC and a licensed ILO they are fairly similar.    I have roughly 500 R710's and 200 DL380 G7/G8's.  We have a few ancient 2950/DL380G6's as well.  They are all extremely reliable.    Folks who prefer Dell are used to them.  Folks who prefer HP are used to them.  They are both solid systems."
homelab,3bkl8k,canhazraid,2,Tue Jun 30 02:27:47 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure that it's a phrasing issue, but the R710's definitely ""allow"" more than 8 disks, they just would require additional cables/backplanes to connect them, since the cases aren't typically configured in a drive-dense style."

homelab,3bkl8k,viktormadarasz,2,Tue Jun 30 06:24:24 2015 UTC,I prefer dell machines due to firmware updates and whatnot being much easier to obtain and deploy on older hardware.  no hoops to jump thru for second hand hardware.
homelab,3bkl8k,cyberwire,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:40:42 2015 UTC,I deal with both for work. I personally prefer open manage to hp's tools although others might as easily think the other way. DRAC works as expected although be warned on newer stuff you have multiple versions with some not giving you all of the features.   I personally like the dell servers better than a bunch of the hp ones for some small stuff like the doors on the front of the tower models. Both are good though and I wouldn't expect one to really outlast the other.   I don't have much experience with that model but most of them have 3.5 inch drives and only allow like 6 if I remember right. If you get one with 2.5 inch drives I think it maxes out at 8 hot swap.

homelab,3bih8v,masteroffm,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:48:26 2015 UTC,"1950's are super loud, and the 2950's are slightly quieter, but suck more power and give off more heat (naturally). In my experience, there's no practical reason for someone to keep them around anymore, not with the advances we've made in technology since their release. Yes, I understand they're dirt cheap/free online... but for the couple hundred bucks one costs to run per year, you can get something better.  I keep a lot of equipment going, and don't have a lot of living space as it is, so silence is something I strive for when putting together gear. That said, I cannot recommended a Fractals R4 case enough to quiet everything down. Easy to work on case, excellent sound dampening materials, and Fractals make silent fans for intake/exhaust that makes me question if the box is even running.  I currently run an i5 Haswell, PERC6 w 2xRAID1s (4x 2TB Reds), and 32GB ECC in one case. Completely silent, very little heat. Idles around 80F, and builds up to 90F when all the VMs are running. For disclosure, it wasn't a cheapo-depot setup. Finding quiet parts that work well, for free, is very hard. People only dispose of stuff that no longer fits their needs, and I've never heard of someone saying ""My equipment is too quiet, let's add some more decibels to this bitch!""  The biggest benefit you have is that you're replacing a 1950, so it's not exactly a modern workhorse. How are you utilizing it? A VM Host I imagine? if so, how many VMs are you hosting? Determine what kind of infrastructure you need first (with some room for future expansion), and the rest will come easier."

StoreFront and Receiver are indeed for connecting to desktops and applications, but this is not desktops as in 'the desktop of the VMs', it's specifically for desktop resources published via XenDesktop for your user community.    You can't really use this for managing the VMs in the same way that you use the VM console or VNC or whatever.. you need to install the XD software as an extra, then publish them to specific AD Domain users (Yes, AD membership is required).  It also only works on Windows, not Linux.   edit - and XenDesktop is actually not related to XenServer... they are different products within a suite.  XS is supported to run on VMWare, Hyper-V, and should probably work (at least basically, without machine provisioning) on any hypervisor."

homelab,3bierr,THATD_BE_GREAT,2,Mon Jun 29 14:05:19 2015 UTC,"Check your contract first. This equipment is usually the property of the provider, even if it's in your house. You might not be able to ""legally"" move it somewhere else.  If you decide to move it, a coupler and another SC-APC patchcord would work. You will need an SC-APC judging by the green color of the connector. Don't try to connect an SC-APC to a regular SC (SC, SC-PC, SC-UPC) because the end of the ceramic ferrule has an 8° angle and it would break if not matched to another APC connector. The angle reduces greatly the signal reflection at the plug."
homelab,3bierr,CBRjack,9,Mon Jun 29 14:13:50 2015 UTC,"Just to add to this... a teleco's equipment is usually the demarc (demarcation) into your home. You only have 'rights' to the outgoing connection from that box, aka: the Cat cable. Messing with the fiber could be considered messing with their network, and they'd be well within their rights to terminate all service to your address. Expect other financial penalties to apply too.  Hate to say it, but you might want to just bite the bullet and pay AT&T to relocate the box. They'll come in, cut the line, relocate the box, and fusion splice the fiber together. You could do it yourself with a hand-kit... but fuck those things."

You get sent to a collections agency and your credit ends up in the shitter.  Don't touch the demarc unless you have an LOA saying you can."

homelab,3bierr,KillAllTheThings,3,Mon Jun 29 16:43:21 2015 UTC,/u/Ghostalker474 is correct about the demarc being in your house where you get a signal you can use (the optical-to-Ethernet mod/demod is theirs). You better be absolutely sure who owns what gear before you go cutting fiber lines and moving stuff around. It will not be pretty if you move their equipment without permission.

homelab,3bierr,tehrabbitt,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:49:42 2015 UTC,"the only equipment that is on ""your side"" is the RJ45 jack and that white wire that runs to your equipment.  the RJ45 jack and everything beyond that is property of AT&T unless you have documentation saying otherwise.  Usually in larger installs / datacenters, you'll have a patch-panel where they will fusion splice the fiber to, then they'll supply you with an ""LOA"" (Letter of Authority) for a specified time period (usually 30-60 days) to actually plug YOUR fiber into THEIR patch panel.  that means after that LOA expires, you can't unplug YOUR fiber without asking them first.  If you do, they can terminate instantly.  I just did an install with a large ISP recently where ISP handles the fiber to the MPOE (Minimum point of Entry) and then fusion spliced it to fiber we pre-ran for them.  that box is property of theirs, they have a padlock on it, we can't even BREATHE on it.  on the other end of that fiber is a patch panel that we supplied, so in essence, we extended our demarc from the MPOE another 2000' to our network racks.  even though we own that fiber, and even though we own the rack, and the patch panel...  we can't plug and unplug our fiber from the patch panel that belongs to us, without their permission and a valid LOA because they see it as an ""Extension"" of the demarc 2000' downstream.  Failure to comply (unplugging without permission for instance) is cause for immediate termination and payment in-full for the entire term (5 years at over 2000/mo)  You can see how expensive a silly mistake can become.  Read your contract carefully.   Sure, your gigafiber @ home isn't going to rape you like that at 2k/mo for 5 years.... but they can still charge you plenty in fees and early termination penalties."
homelab,3bierr,The707kid,2,Tue Jun 30 01:59:54 2015 UTC,"this this this this.  That is an SC-APC connector.  not your standard APC connector.  IN addition, it IS in fact, single-mode fiber.  so you'd have to be aware of that as well.  As some people have also said, you don't touch the demarc.. you don't move it.  you can EXTEND it (read: with their permission) but usually it has to be done with a contractor authorized by them as it IS their equipment and their fiber.  by touching it, they can consider it to be ""Tampering"" and unless you have an valid LOA in place authorizing you to plug / unplug / power off their equipment, you can't even breathe on that little box.  by doing so, you would be considered ""in breach of contract"" and they could in turn terminate your service and charge you an early termination fee up to the full cost of what you would have paid if you hadn't have canceled (Lets say 50/mo for 3 years... and you're 12 months in... that's a $1200 fee...).  Failure to pay the fee of course would send off to collections where they'd ensure your credit was ruined.  Rule of thumb... if you don't have a receipt saying you PAID for that media converter...  and that you PURCHASED it... it's property of theirs... and by moving / modifying it in ANY way.. you're in turn touching their equipment without permission, thus breaking your contract.  Advice:  Call Them.  They will gladly help you (for a fee of course) but you might be able to argue it wasn't installed right in the first place or that it interferes with XYZ where it currently is."

They will fall over themselves in California to fix it even if they dont technically have to. I have got more things done by filing PUC complaints than I could possibly list here. If not in my state, most states have a similar system of oversight. You should not have to pay to move their demark since they don't want you messing with it.   PS: Also it's not cheeting, that's what the PUC's are there for, making sure the utilities hold up their end of the bargain and take care of the customer.  Also phone support is clueless, get the local supervisors number and try him/her, google it or stop a ATT employee on the street and get the local number.

They were either outdated so I needed to use old versions of dependencies, or they were single purpose (ex: Kippo only listens for SSH).   I got lucky and stumbled across Modern Honeypot Network (MHN). This thing was perfect. It has a central management web interface for setting up new honeypots as well as viewing events on all your pots.   You setup one VM as the MHN server, easy process... Then you setup a second VM for a honeypot. It'll let you choose from a lot of the popular variations. The best part is setting up the honeypot is a one-line script. It downloads the tools, installs everything, connects to the management server, everything. Once you have the first one done, you can literally setup a dozen of these in an hour.

I'm assuming the 1TB is mostly upload, in which case, look for any foreign connections (netstat or similar) to your open ports; this should let you know if you have an FTP leacher or similar.

They are built very well and have built in IR sensors.   Here are some sample stills.  http://imgur.com/gallery/GOCMA  The wireless camera works pretty good, mine just arrived last week, just got it installed. This camera does have some quirks. It requires a wall plug to get power. The camera itself attaches to a magnetic base, making the camera easy to remove it within reach. It is not an outdoor camera.    Ubiquity also provides a free NVR software. The latest release works very well.  The software also can be connected to send you emails when there are motion triggers.

homelab,3bew99,fall4free,17,Sun Jun 28 16:25:51 2015 UTC,"There are generally three types of switches:  VLAN agnostic.  They dont know what a VLAN is, and if they receive VLAN traffic will just broadcast it -- or maybe drop it (as the packet is larger than 1514 bytes).  Really, you dont want VLAN tagged traffic hitting non-vlan-aware switches.  These are usually ""unmanaged switches""  OSI Layer 2 VLAN switches, or L2 switches understand VLAN traffic, and can distribute VLAN traffic to ports.  Port 1 and 2 are VLAN 10, port 3 and 4 are VLAN 20, port 5 is a trunk port and gets all traffic.  When broadcast traffic hits port 1, it is distributed to port 2, and 5 (tagged as VLAN 10).  When broadcast traffic hits port 3, it is broadcast to port 4 and 5 (tagged as VLAN 20).  These switches cannot route IP traffic however, so if VLAN 10 is 192.168.10.0/24, and VLAN 20 is 192.168.20.0/24, 192.168.10.5 cannot poing 192.168.20.5 without a router (pfSense, etc) that is on a trunk port (port 5) and can see both networks.  Your new switch is likely a L2 VLAN Switch, and you will need to rely on PFsense to provide sub-wirespeed routing.  OSI Layer 3 VLAN switches are able to route IP traffic, examples are Cisco 3550/3750's (and hosts of others).  These are generally the most expensive, but usually allow wire speed IP routing between VLANS.  Many also allow ""firewalling"" or ACL's between VLANS.  There are tons of nuances (VLAN trunks can have some vlans, how does spanning tree work over vlans, default vlan on trunk ports, wireless VLANs, etc) that you can learn, but arent really needed at a 101 level."

homelab,3bew99,dpsi,3,Sun Jun 28 23:46:12 2015 UTC,"To be honest, the question is a little bit unclear, but I'll try to answer it from a different point of view.  I haven't taken my CCNA test yet, but I learned a metric crapton from the CCNA course videos from CBT Nuggets. It explained, in a crazy amount of detail, how subnets work, how VLANs work, how and why you would use them, etc. Half of it is theory, which is applicable to any router from any company, and then the other half is practical, i.e. ""these are the commands you need to enter into a Cisco switch in order to enable this particular interface"". Because /u/fall4free hasn't mentioned any Cisco equipment, it's not 100% useful, but it will still help you understand everything about VLAN theory very quickly (and the course costs money...but the internet is a magical place, not that I would encourage such a thing).  To be more specific about OP's particular hardware, they'll have to ask the Great Googs for a walkthrough of setting up a VLAN on the particular D-Link hardware, which shouldn't be too hard to find I would imagine. Then, with both the theory and the practical how-to of VLANs, OP should have all the tools they need to know ""how to do VLANs""."

homelab,3bew99,silvadiego1512,5,Sun Jun 28 23:44:39 2015 UTC,"A VLAN is like a private road. Sort of. But, a VLAN is not a security boundary.  Example (VLANs are numbered, we'll use colors here: VLAN Blue, only ""blue"" cars can go down this road. VLAN Red, only ""red"" cars can go down this road. VLAN Green (This is VLAN 1 or the default VLAN, like a big highway)  So, blue cars and red cars are segregated. They can only go where their color road leads. If a blue car needs to get to a house on ""red"" road, they can't. You need to ""trunk"" those VLANs or make the road Blue/Red. That ""green"" road is the default road that cars are allowed down by default if you don't assign them a ""road"".  VLANs are cool, they allow for logical segregation of hosts but they can be a pain if you need to get ""blue"" to ""red"" and they are on different switches. You have to make the trunk or VLAN changes to all the switches they will traverse to allow the cars to get to their destination.  I hope this makes sense."

Also, if you can live with only 3 internal drives, you can switch to the Cooler Master Elite 110 which is much smaller, much cheaper, and still a fantastic case."

homelab,3ben0w,LHD21,2,Mon Jun 29 15:53:06 2015 UTC,"The switch chip hardware supports:   basic frame forwarding (based on learned and static MAC tables), VLANs (encapsulating/de-encapsulating/filtering), ""trunking"" (link aggregation without LACP), and in the case of the CRS226, certain traffic shaping options and certain ACLs   Everything else is handled in software via the internal router-on-a-stick, processed by a 400 MHz MIPS chip and limited to an internal 1 gbps interface. This includes all layer 3 functions (IPv4/IPv6 routing), all MPLS, as well as various other functions such as STP, ""bonding"" (link aggregation supporting LACP), DHCP relays, more sophisticated traffic shaping, more sophisticated ACLs… literally everything else.  If you want a port to do anything not in that list up top, be prepared to send all its traffic through the CPU. There's no middle ground; the switch can't e.g. process spanning tree BPDUs in software and forward data frames in hardware. You either get wire-speed forwarding in the switch chip or you get software features, never both."

You could add a 4 port nic to your NAS and setup trunking.  You would be able to push ~1Gbps over 4 lanes--how many connections will your NAS truely be serving at highest utilization?
homelab,3ben0w,vsxi-13,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:50:22 2015 UTC,A few - They would be going to/from a cluster of VM hosts and media consumption devices. I just don't want networking to be that wall. I am considering link agg to keep costs down though.  I know I could go directly to the server but was hoping to go network for the flexibility associated with being able to switch it up anytime (no pun intended).
homelab,3ben0w,ToiletDick,2,Sun Jun 28 17:12:18 2015 UTC,"There's nothing wrong with wanting to connect your NAS at 10G or running 10G at home, but do you really have a need for this that will be solved with a cheap switch?  It is very unlikely that some VMs or ""media consumption"" devices are going to be maxing out their gigabit connections simultaneously, even more unlikely that your NAS is going to be able to do that--especially with VMs in the mix...  If you truly do need to supply several gigabit streams from a 10G port none of these cheap switches are going to be good at this since you'll be going 10G->1G and they all have tiny buffers that are poorly suited to this task.  I'd sooner buy an all 10G switch or just buy some 10G NICs and attach the devices you want together."

homelab,3bf0cd,kaydub88,2,Sun Jun 28 17:03:41 2015 UTC,"Sound like you need PfSense or similar. If you have an esxi host at the moment you could simply spin it up in that (it's free), BUT, you'd need a bit of network knowledge to pull it off and tweaking your network settings in the exi host and maybe a 4 port NIC to use for the LAN1/LAN2/WAN and management links.  You'd basically be using you existing router as a network connection to your provider, pfsense can handle this too so you might be able to even get rid of your existing router, but it depends on your provider.  The gist it's though that you could give your existing router a static ip, say 192.168.0.1, turn off dhcp and then in pfsense set up 2 vlans, each with its own ip range and dhcp, although one of them would probably be 192.168.0.x/24 with .1 reserved but set as the gateway for your traffic.  Pfsense handles the rest."
homelab,3bf0cd,AncientsofMumu,2,Sun Jun 28 19:00:31 2015 UTC,"Layer 2 aka Managed Switch will give you the VLANs you want.       If your ASUS supports VLANs, you can have it act as the Gateway to 50 also so you can route between the two. PFsense is a PC based router that can do VLANs and IP routing as well as NAT routing which is what gets you on the net safely.  Or you can get a Layer2+ / Layer 3 switch which can do the VLANs and act as the Gateway between the VLANs.  Then you set the ASUS as the ""Default Route"" in the L3 switch so that unknown traffic goes off to the internet."
homelab,3bf0cd,Casper042,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:13:41 2015 UTC,"Seems like it should be very doable on your Asus router.

homelab,3bc2k2,just_insane,7,Sat Jun 27 23:11:16 2015 UTC,How hard was it to figure out how to do the VLANs and isolated networks?
homelab,3bc2k2,gospelwut,8,Sat Jun 27 22:07:41 2015 UTC,"Not so difficult, with a small bit of research!  For physical segmentation, the trick was to make sure that the interface on the ESXi host has access to all VLANS, this way the VLANs can be configured on the physical switch.   For the rest, creating a new Network on the ESXi host for each VLAN allowed me to easily assign interfaces to VMs."
homelab,3bc2k2,just_insane,5,Sat Jun 27 22:25:44 2015 UTC,I take it you're running the VLANs all up to the pfsense box to do inter-vlan routing?
homelab,3bc2k2,troweigh,3,Sat Jun 27 22:58:14 2015 UTC,"Exactly correct, each VLAN runs to pfsense and does inter-vlan routing automatically. Then it's up to firewall rules to actually enforce the segmentation piece"
homelab,3bc2k2,ThePegasi,2,Sat Jun 27 23:20:41 2015 UTC,That makes sense. I don't have a switch capable of VLANs unfortunately.

homelab,3bc2k2,ThePegasi,4,Sat Jun 27 22:44:20 2015 UTC,"Hell, if your needs aren't as in depth as a fully managed Cisco offers, cheaper ""smart"" switches from TP-Link etc. offer enough to do a basic VLAN setup for not much more than unmanaged switches. And without fan noise or larger kit, but keeping gigabit speeds.  My first homelab switch was a £25 TL-SG108E, then I moved to a £70 TL-SG3210 for a few more features, and I'm only now buying a Juniper to do stuff like inter-VLAN routing on my switch rather than my router.

homelab,3bc2k2,ChrisTheRazer,6,Sun Jun 28 05:45:59 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for the OP, but I do this because I have very little confidence in the quality/trustworthiness of the code that runs on devices like that.  I don't like the the overall lack of skill, scrutiny, and integrity that goes into the software on a gaming console or bluray player or other consumer level device.  I don't want that stuff having access to my internal resources, especially a NAS box.  Mainly it just needs a route to the internet to receive updates and, potentially, communicate with upstream servers."
homelab,3bc2k2,pdmcmahon,4,Sun Jun 28 13:21:43 2015 UTC,Yeah this is essentially the reason. Some of these devices have a tendency to do device discovery of some sort. What I may do going forward is setup a Plex media server on that network that can only access port 445 on the NAS to get it's media library. This way the smart devices can get to the Plex media server without needing direct access to the NAS.   They really don't need anything else stored there
homelab,3bc2k2,BIO_Wolf,2,Sun Jun 28 15:05:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, with the exception of wanting to watch stored media on your NAS. This is where things get into blurred lines territory. Security and efficiency versus high availability. Granted, I'm new to heavy duty storage(my drobo was a nice gift,) so the first thing I did was allocate two terabytes to media for streaming around my house. Of course, I have my two iSCSI interfaces attached directly to my ESXi host, with my remaining two interfaces on that machine going to the rest of the network, so I control where data is and isn't allowed to go, and how."

homelab,3bc2k2,0Ninth9Night0,3,Sun Jun 28 06:43:47 2015 UTC,Looks sweet! One small thing I would prefer to change is the numbering of vlans and subnets. I don't put them right next to each other to begin with. So for example you could have    VLAN 20 - Services VLAN 30 - DMZ VLAN 40 - MONITOR   Which makes it easier if you need to separate services in the future. Then you can just do VLAN 21 - Services2 or whatever for testing something. I've also found that it helps me remember which one is which since it's a larger difference between 20 and 30 then 22 and 23.

The cs24 can be found with a nice config for around $250 and has 4 hot swap bays max 48 gb ddr2 and 2 processors.

For the price its a great workhorse server but you need to weigh that up against the price of extra parts that it needs to be useful for you.  My personal preference would be make my gaming pc standalone machines and build my first server out of the old machines and then become more adventures with the next server (it may only be 6months but I think you will find disk speed/volume, network speed and ram being the bigger issues for a home lab server over high end cpu's) and you will know what parts you need to suit your home lab without effecting you gaming."

homelab,3bb898,-Bismarck,3,Sat Jun 27 15:40:37 2015 UTC,See the last post here.    Basically setup a crappy 32mb USB stick on the internal port with grub.  Use grub to then boot off the 5th SATA port (your SSD).
homelab,3bb898,canhazraid,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:25:42 2015 UTC,"Already seen that post, but using grub is what helped me out in the end.  Everytime I tried to boot from a USB I got a Red error screen with: 'Illegal opcode detected'. At first I thought this had something to do with my usb-stick or a disk/partition w/e. After a while I swipped maintenance switch 6 to On, boot, shutdown, switch 6 to off (that wipes your nvram). After that I didnt get the illegal opcode message anymore.  In the end it seemed like my ml110 saw the usb stick as disk 0, so disk 4 (from your link) wasn't the SSD windows was installed on. I kept getting errors until I changed grub to use disk 5 (6th real drive) as bootdrive. And after that I was happy and I could go to sleep :)"
homelab,3bap74,Fen-Jai,6,Sat Jun 27 11:48:55 2015 UTC,"I assume this is a 1U switch.  That means all of the fans are tiny, and spin super fast.  And they can't be made bigger because the back panel isn't large enough.  If you don't care about rack mounting it, what you can do is cut circular holes in the top of the switch, just next to the original fans, and mount bigger fans on those.  Also, be sure to tape over the old fan holes to make sure the air still flows through the whole switch."
homelab,3bap74,TexasDex,5,Sat Jun 27 15:12:56 2015 UTC,You want to make sure the air flows over all of the heatsinks and components it is supposed to though.  So leaving the other ports as inlets or outlets can help facilitate that.
homelab,3bap74,fostytou,3,Sat Jun 27 15:21:03 2015 UTC,"I was suggesting that you put the new fans in the back, right next to where the old ones were.  You'd want to block off the old ones in that case, because if you don't then instead of flowing front to back, air would go in the old fan ports and immediately out the new ones, without cooling the rest of the switch.  If you put the new fan holes in the center of the chassis then yes, leaving the rear fan holes empty would be a good idea."
homelab,3bap74,TexasDex,3,Sat Jun 27 15:35:28 2015 UTC,"You could get some quiet fans like Noctuas, but since they are going to be 60 or 80mm, they will still produce some noise. You can use resistors to limit the speed and make them quieter. You can also take some fans out, but don't remove them all. You don't need nearly as much cooling as stock, but even a little airflow makes a huge difference in internal component temperature. I've done this to old switches with failed fans, and you do need at least one working fan or you risk shortening the lifespan significantly."
homelab,3bap74,TheUbuntuGuy,2,Sat Jun 27 15:04:44 2015 UTC,"You could do like the guy below said and cut some holes in the top or if you don't mind ugly on one side cut some pvc to adapt a 120mm fan to some 60mm holes or whatever are available.  Bigger Heatsinks might be OK though, but you definitely want something to move the skin letter of air around.  Also just consider adding resistors or pwc inline on the existing fans and take some outlet temps with a cheap stick or infrared thermometer to see how bad you've made things.  Sound dampening material can help too, but don't let it block heat convection and make sure the switch isn't sandwiched somewhere."
homelab,3bap74,fostytou,2,Sat Jun 27 15:26:10 2015 UTC,"Get some Noctua fans.  Expensive af, but the top dog when it comes to PC fans.  But if all the fans you have are smaller than 120mm, forget having cool, quiet and performant."

The one I picked up had 32 GB of RAM, which is pretty badass for under $100 -- dual CPUs, two hot-swappable hard drive bays, all that RAM! People around here really like the Dell PowerEdge 2950, which is pretty solid too. Just make sure you get a decent amount of RAM (16 or 32GB), and x86-compatible CPU(s). No HDDs is no big deal -- just make sure there are SATA cables included and you can connect a drive you've got laying around. As far as Sun boxes -- check out the Sun Fire x2200 M2 or the x4200. They can be pretty loud though, that's the only bad thing. Check the spec sheets online for the servers you're looking at on eBay or wherever and see if they mention the amount of audible noise it puts out, usually measured in dB. Mine idles at 70dB, which is really damn loud! Shoot for something 50dB or less, if you can, unless you've got a basement you can put the server in so you don't have to hear it. Good luck!"

I say that because in the $100-$150 price range, you can get a server powerful enough to do foundation and more, because you may end up wanting to do more. The Dell PowerEdge 2950, for example, is an old but powerful workhorse, if you can find a good deal on it. Heck, even the 2750 & 2850 is good enough, as well as the 1750-1950. IBM is great, but there's a lot in the low budget price range. Trust me, that's where I shop.  P.S.

But, with RAID50, you can lose two disks, so long as they are from each side, and run degraded and still rebuild.  Unfortunately that rumor is spreading like wild fire.  Its true that large disks with lower MTBF are, statistically, more likely  to fail during rebuild.  But, working in the industry with more RAID5 arrays in place than I can count... we have yet to experience a failed rebuild.  And, of course, backups and replication are for security, not RAID policies."
homelab,3b882k,canhazraid,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:28:52 2015 UTC,"Raid5 is dead with consumer drives like the WD Red non-Pro.    I'm not sure you fully understand what you are saying.  The assertion that ""RAID5 is dead"" was because an URE would cause a raid controller to fail the entire array.  Modern LSI based controllers handle URE's much more gracefully, will note the issue in the log, and keep replicating data.  Software based RAID (ZFS, etc) all will continue on with life.  No - your array wont 'fail' on a 9240-8i because one 512k block on the disk had an URE.  Keep in mind that the URE has to be in a location that is in use by the disk to even effect you.  So that scary 1 in 1014 URE figure, with disks only 50% in use, becomes 1/2 in 1014, effectively cutting the odds in half that you'll be effected.  Then that URE needs to be in a file that is negatively effected by bad data.    Your TV collection?  Wont matter.  A single bad pixel.  Your photography collection?  Your MP3 collection?  All line noise.  You've basically narrowed the effect of an URE down to an EXTREMELY small chance of hitting a binary in a location that contains code.  If you hit a DLL in a string field -- it wont even matter (and windows should automatically fix it).  RAID5 is in no way ""dead"".  A disk failure is rare.  An URE is even more rare.  An URE in a part of the disk that has content is even more rare.  An URE within binary code that is system critical is probably less of a chance than winning the lottery."
homelab,3b882k,poogi71,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:07:38 2015 UTC,The URE interpretation is completely wrong too. It is some average over a large number or drives over time. Some HDDs will not have any issues and stone will have a lot over time.  RAID5 had issues and if you really want redundancy do go with RAID6 but the incessant berating of RAID5 is completely our of place.

homelab,3b882k,Nerdnub,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:32:08 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that RAID10 was RAID(1+0) since, as far as I know, non-nested RAID configurations don't yet go above 6."

homelab,3b882k,acre_,2,Sat Jun 27 19:07:36 2015 UTC,If you have 10 drives you shouldn't have a problem implementing a RAID array with both performance striping and redundancy.
homelab,3b882k,-Bismarck,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:42:07 2015 UTC,Would that be RAID 5?
homelab,3b882k,acre_,5,Fri Jun 26 19:50:28 2015 UTC,"Raid 5 has very bad writing performance, with 10 drives I would get raid 1+0 for performance reasons"
homelab,3b882k,johnbradbury,3,Fri Jun 26 20:01:49 2015 UTC,That's an option. It has both the striping and parity. Someone said RAID10 and that would work too. I'm but a lowly hardware support tech right now so I don't have the practical knowledge to contribute.  I live life on the edge my NAS at home has a single 3TB Seagate in it. Oh yeah. That thing holds all my prod VMs on it.
homelab,3b882k,Nerdnub,2,Fri Jun 26 19:56:21 2015 UTC,"If you want the maximum performance and the highest level of usable storage then just got with RAID0, this means you won't have any redundancy should a drive fail but it would perform much better than RAID5.  If you need a level of redundancy whilst maintaining performance then as Nerdnub suggests RAID10 is the way to go. You'll need double the disk space to meet your requirements but you'll have a complete backup."
homelab,3b882k,linuxlearningnewbie,2,Fri Jun 26 19:58:37 2015 UTC,"Depending on the size of the drives, you may not want RAID5. Industry standard is currently not to use RAID5 in any array that uses drives of 1TB or larger because of the amount of time it takes to rebuild from a failed drive. If you had another drive fail during rebuild, you'd lose everything. Same with RAID0. While it'd be fast, one bad drive and everything's gone."

If you want to have NAT as well, follow the networking model and set the iptables masquerade rules, and the bridge will do the NAT'ing.   If you have more than 1 nic, and want to use bonding, you'll Setup the bond with whatever method you use, and then attach the bond to the bridge.   You usually never need to attach a physical nic to the devices."
homelab,3b7goz,buildsrc,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:24:47 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'll let you know after I try that. I might still have problems with CentOS. It should automatically receive an IP from my DHCP server in bridged mode, correct?"
homelab,3b7goz,andyr354,2,Fri Jun 26 17:31:01 2015 UTC,"Wait, no it wont. Not with nat. nat is meant to have it's own broadcast domain, and your ""bridge"" is the gateway out. Unless you setup some layer3, the DHCP broadcast wouldn't pass through the bridge.   So, 2 choices:  Don't Nat, and let your VM's pull an IP from your existing DHCP. They'll appear just like any other client on your network.   Or  Nat, and setup a DHCP server inside the nat, i.e. on the CentOS box. It'll serve DHCP to the guest vms and containers.   Unless you've got a strong reason to need to NAT, I'd just hook up to the bridge and keep it simple."

homelab,3b4m17,buildsrc,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:11:17 2015 UTC,"Ideally you want a mail server with atleast postfix dovcot and then only postfix on any servers you want to send mail from. You will also need to run a proper DNS server which can handle MX records like BIND or PowerDNS, I like PowerDNS as you can use the Poweradmin web ui to manage all your records. Also any machines you want to use to interact with the mail server will need to be using the same DNS server.   I'd recommmend setting up PowerDNS and then using that as your main local DNS server in your LAN.   You will need to setup one or more accounts and then setup postfix on each of your servers to relay email using the appropriate account. If you google postfix gmail, the setup is the same just replace the details with your own.  This is one of the best guides I've found and is very up to date, you won't need any of the spam stuff for local mail https://www.exratione.com/2014/05/a-mailserver-on-ubuntu-1404-postfix-dovecot-mysql/.   The easy way is just to use postfix on each server as normal and relay messages through gmail. Or optionally you could buy a domain and use something like Mailgun, Mandrill, Sendgrid or Amazon SES. You can then get notification direct to your normal email account, useful if you want to catch alerts from the lab on your phone while your out and about.   Or you could just setup a Mailinabox server on Vultr for $5 a month."

homelab,3b4hqg,just_insane,3,Fri Jun 26 00:53:42 2015 UTC,"A few reasons. Sophos hasn't really been that well known. It's an expensive option if you don't know about the free home license.   Pfsense has also been a well known excellent firewall and router for many many years. It's got more homelab/enthusiast 'cred/market'.   If I didn't have a 12 year old boy, I would just be using vyos or pfsense for my network. Needing a web filter pushed me to testing out different UTMs"

I'm a little confused on what you mean by OS for the VM. Hypervisor? Any of them will work. Guest OS? There is no choice as it comes on it's on SuSe distro on a iso.  pfSense is good for general firewalling and to use with no license restrictions. Sophos offers a more complete package with a webfilter, AV, etc but you can only use it up to 50 Ip addresses behind it."

homelab,3b4hqg,tanuki94,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:34:18 2015 UTC,"I believe the best way would be to have it in line acting as a router between your clients network and the pfSense router, otherwise your clients could just set their default gateway to pfSense and bypass the filter all together. If that's not a problem then just setup Sophos' default GW to pfSense, and your clients to Sophos. Otherwise you would have to do something like this:  client (network A) > (Network A)sophos(Network B) > (Network B) pfSense > Internet  Someone smarter than me will probably say this is a bad idea, but it's what I would try to setup first and test it."

By not very popular, I mean they aren't very popular on the second-hand market...not that they are unpopular at the enterprise level.

homelab,3b46bi,VexingRaven,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:52:42 2015 UTC,"While one could infer that I'm blaming windows 2012 for my issues from the title, I'm not. It's totally the HP raid card that caused the data to be destroyed. But the 400 watts the server + arrays pull was 50% of the reason to move to a lower power solution.  The other half was the raid card.  Thanks for your insightful comment though, it gives me a reason to explain more of my reasoning."
homelab,3b46bi,dxm765,3,Fri Jun 26 01:58:15 2015 UTC,"Ehh, see while the Synology has alot of appealing features to me (though i never looked at them until now) i, personally feel my FreeNAS server was a better choice for me, as while the Synology boasts 108Tb capacity and has the option of external devices, how far can it really go? And the better question is is does it use a proprietary raid level or file system? What happens if its out of warranty and it takes a crap, are you able to plug those drives into another Synology or into a normal server and load up a linux OS and import the drives/raid and its data? My real qualm would simply be no 10Gb or even a expansion slot for future use, granted you could team up those 4 1Gb NIC's but that could be saturated completely depending on its task. I will congratulate you though no matter what on moving from windows, i had 8Tb in HW Raid10 and had the controller crap out, thankfully a friend had the same controller and i was able to import my config and move my data off windows, and i also didnt want to suffer bit rot with my future data....so FreeNAS was my choice for my 32Tb of storage. I wish you the best of luck on your homelab journey!"
homelab,3b46bi,Too_Much_Overtime,3,Thu Jun 25 22:11:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  I started seeing a ton of Synology stuff as soon as I subbed here. I, like everyone else here, love setting up and configuring my devices... so I obviously have a freenas server running everything. Can anyone really explain the advantages of the two which would make me pay for this storage solution vs. freenas??"
homelab,3b46bi,dxm765,3,Thu Jun 25 22:58:54 2015 UTC,"I really like FreeNAS because of the file system ZFS and its ability to have 1-3 parity drives, self healing of the file system, and its fairly resilient to error with the proper hardware and cooling, and of course proper burn in time. For FreeNAS its prefered to use server grade hardware, not your run of the mill gaming computer, or the computer you have sitting around thats old, i'm talking about a CPU  that supports ECC + a motherboard that supports ECC , have ECC RAM (8Gb min for FreeNAS) and then have either a HBA card that does JBOD or onboard ports that are intel. FreeNAS can also be picky when it comes to onboard NIC's and devices, such as you want a intel NIC with intel SATA ports. Using improper hardware can generate a ton of issues, dont use motherboards with audio, or fancy features that are next to worthless to FreeNAS, and stay clear of hardware raid. I will admit that you can get a Synology box for less than buying and building a FreeNAS server...but there are of course difference reasons we go with one or the other, or something different entirely. I went with FreeNAS because of the file system, it already uses server grade hardware that i have in my possession, has great expand-ability,  and i can add 10Gb to it for my homelab that i've already done; and it supports plugins/jails to run another OS inside of it such as plex, couchpotato,sickrage/sickbeard, and a ton of others.....it comes down to what do you want to spend, how much data do you have, what do YOU think you'll be doing in a year or more with your data, and do you have the time to investigate your options? I am however somewhat on sided, as i have no Synology equipment, so my views are skewed but someone else might do a better job in explaining it or adding on to my statements/correcting me."
homelab,3b46bi,dxm765,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:16:44 2015 UTC,"The Synology consumes 66-100 watts under load fully populated and about 25ish under idle.  That's a HUGE plus for us in warmer climates, as wattage = heat = spinning fans = higher power consumtion.  It runs a quad core Atom processor, and can be upgraded to 6GB of memory.  It can run many popular apps and share files with the cloud.  The biggest problem for me was that it was about $950 for me.  FreeNAS is attractive if you already have the hardware lying around, so the cost of entry is usually the RAID card (which is about $100) and the disks/enclosures.  For the same amount of money invested in an existing system, you can populate the system with tons of storage.  It's also attractive since you control the entire stack.  You have flexibility to upgrade CPU/Memory/Case/etc.  You have that to a certain extent with the Synology, but still is a decision you need to consider.  I've had a home lab in some way, shape, or form for many years, and it was just easier for me to manage systems that are plug and play.  I don't have to sweat getting things configured or finding drives that have died, etc.  The lower power bill helps too :)"
homelab,3b46bi,hankrearden,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:47:43 2015 UTC,"That is exactly it, i had most of the hardware i just didnt have the chassis, so i picked up a 24 bay supermicro and away i went. I wish the Synology had the kind of horse power i needed because it would be a very attractive option...but me n the misses LOVE plex...lol, i am not sure how well that quad core atom would do transcoding multiple 1080 steams, as per the heat exactly, for a warmer climate its great for low heat, i keep my lab in the basement, and here on the East Coast it does get warm, but its never (rarely) 100Fl, but even then the basement stays 60-70F and the servers dont generate too much heat depending on load.

Bluray standard allows for a max of something like 45mbps but I don't think anything gets close.   I'm just saying don't dismiss 100meg links out-of-hand.

homelab,3b46bi,systo_,3,Fri Jun 26 12:18:01 2015 UTC,"You're thinking of webdl rips, which use lower bitrate.

Still no where close to needing 1Gb connection, but it's a lot more than what you were saying."
homelab,3b46bi,HellDiverUK,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:41:14 2015 UTC,"And you know, everyone is different and requires different things.  The lower power consumption, expandability, and ability to run what I need in docker containers on the NAS was attractive enough to me that I decided to pull the trigger on the 1815, and will probably add the expansion array in the next 60 days.  In terms of the network speed, those 4 1Gb links can be bonded using LACP, which my HP 1810 switch supports.  I seldom saturate the link so I'm not worried about that in the home lab.  Concerning the proprietary raid solution, it's straight linux volumes, and can be recovered. https://www.synology.com/en-us/knowledgebase/faq/579  Thanks for the best wishes, I'm excited to see what this platform can do!"

homelab,3b0g7p,LHD21,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:50:39 2015 UTC,VMware 5.5.  I've got 5 hosts in a compute cluster where most of the VMs live.  Then there's a network cluster with 2 hosts running FT for the network VMs.
homelab,3b0g7p,BloodyIron,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:10:11 2015 UTC,So VMware is allowing a single VM to span multiple systems?
homelab,3b0g7p,LHD21,2,Thu Jun 25 16:38:51 2015 UTC,"VMware FT works by using Lockstep©®™ which is a feature that runs two copies of the same VM on different hosts.  With 5.5 there are VM limitations which I think are only 1 vCPU and a memory cap. I  think they've relaxed these requirements in 6.   You have two hosts running the same VM. If a host fails the other host already has the VM running, in the same state as the VM on the failed device.  So a host can fail nearly invisibly.    VMware also supports high availability for vCenter managed hosts with shared storage.  If a host fails while in a HA cluster, any VM on shared storage will automatically be restarted on a currently viable host.  There are of course a ton of ways to modify that behavior including host affinity and VM dis-affinity (is that a word) but that's the large strokes.   I have very specific layer 1 requirements for my network devices.  NICs in the VM need to correspond to specific NICs in the host so that the router/firewall will route and firewall correctly.  I can't keep layer 1 separation and have HA in a DRS enabled cluster without running at least one additional cable to each host.  It made the most sense to setup two small hosts as their own cluster and then keep all the application VMs in the compute cluster where everything is managed through vLans.  Alternatively I could have handled everything through vLans by plugging my internet connection into my switch on an access port set for a vLan labeled untrusted.  Then setup port groups on the vSwitches that only allowed the network VM to connect to the untrusted vLan.  Technically layer 2 would be safe but I just felt better about layer 1 segregation since I'm fairly certain it'll lead to significantly few oh shit moments.   Here's more info about VMware FT."
homelab,3b0g7p,BloodyIron,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:46:28 2015 UTC,"""Lockstep"" sounds identical to XEN's (NOT XENSERVER) Remus technology.  Also, the fail-over of VMs you outline here, not exactly what I thought you meant.  Neither of these configurations are true compute clustering, or what I thought you meant. You're running a fairly commonplace HA configuration, which is not a compute cluster or application cluster (where nodes coming on and offline don't result in environment restarts).  But still good to know :D"

The i7 is overkill for gaming   No, AFAIK the k model chips do not support vt-D and therefore do not support passthrough.  Plex server: can be run on Linux/Windows. I run mine on my DC with a network storage drive that holds all the media (from the NAS OS I have virtualized).  Torrent: I have an Ubuntu VM with 1 vCPU and 2 GB of RAM for SABnzbd, Couchpotato, Sonarr and Deluge. Works perfectly  Wiki: I use media wiki for my wiki, I also have osTicket for making tickets as an inbetween for working on something and documenting in the wiki.  pfSense: very good choice. I personally use Sophos. Easy to setup. For a guide on networking see: https://blog.justin-tech.com/sophos-utm-9-on-esxi-5-5/ which goes through setting up Sophos on ESXI 5.5, ESXI 6 should be the same. Networking part will be the same for pfSense.  OpenVPN: For access to your local network: pfSense has this included. Also has a very nice plugin for creating the setup files for things like ios, windows, android.  Ubiquity: I'm sure a small VM will be able to run the software needed  Localbackups: I have a VM that runs the crashplan service and has NFS shares for my NAS that it backs up to Crashplan, works pretty well.  I personally use ESXI, however since you don't need it for learning, you could look at hyper-v or proxmox (which has a nice webGUI for configuration).

Works very well, however I have a problem with it dropping a Seagate Desktop (3TB) drive from the array every time it reboots, and have to remake the array. Usually takes about 6 hours to rebuild. However, I do not think this is an issue with OpenMediaVault, as much as using a desktop drive in a server.  I actually recently moved my mediawiki to a Digital Ocean Droplet to free some resources on my server, however, I might move it back, as I realized that I was only sitting around 6GB of RAM active, and 16 consumed. It wasn't swapping to disk AFAIK, but performance seemed low. Something to look at in the future I guess.  As for accessing it, yes, you can just use the VM's IP address. I however use my (startup) company's domain which works pretty well. I might get another domain for private usage.  Also, if you are looking for SSL certificates and you have a publically registered domain, look at StartSSL. Awesome service. It only costs to revoke certs ($28) which I unfortunately have to do at some point duo to how my mail server creates SSL certs. :("

Install 4 server 2012 r2 VM's with no roles called whatever you want, Srv01 Srv02 etc. Snapshot all 4 in this state.  Install 1 windows 7 x64 VM and 1 windows 8 x64 VM and snapshot em both.  The main point here is don't bother thinking about how many DCs you need and wether or not to install dhcp and DNS on the same server.  Once you have the above set, your golden.  Install 2 DCs and get them replicating, then blow them away and start over. Do the same thing with powershell.  Blow em away.  Setup dhcp and make sure your windows 7 can get an IP address. Start over again.  Repeat, 100 times, setting it up 100 different ways :-).  Edit: added windows 8 so you can play with item level targeting when playing with Group Policy."

Leaving you a bit of extra room to try things on /r/selfhosted  That said, depending on how you setup your guests, you should be able to get away with it. For example, it is possible to run pfSense on 512 MB of RAM, and ubuntu server (no GUI) on the same amount, although it might be slow.  Note that step 11 has you setup a wiki, which means you do not need to dedicate a wiki.   As for pfSense, I might suggest that you look into an extra NIC, for your management of the box, in case your pfSense goes down.  Not sure about proxmox, but I have an OMV guest that I use as a NAS with the hard drives passed through it in ESXI, a similar setup should be easy to do. This will allow you to run RAID 6, motherboard RAID is not recommended.  As for hosting website (including wordpress) look at Ajenti and Ajenti V, these allow you to easily setup multiple websites on one guest, saving resources (as a plus, it use nginx).

homelab,3b0l96,WJKay,3,Thu Jun 25 02:05:07 2015 UTC,"Shameless Self-Plug time :D  For the weather station, I made something called 'dasHome' (it's in need of code cleaning but it works!) Currently it polls weatherunderground for current weather. I've got it set to pull and update every 10 minutes, refreshing the page as well. It's also got live traffic thanks to Google (utilizes geo-location if enabled in your browse.) Was working on a WOL tool, however life got the best of me and I haven't paid much attention to it unfortunately. I think this will change this weekend, so stay tuned :)  Link: https://github.com/alexconrey/dashome  As for monitoring, I use opsview (over-glorified nagios solution) - it's dead simple to configure once you get used to the layout and management of it all. I really want to use observium as my monitoring solution, however for me to do that I need to come up with some sort of automation (chef comes to mind) to change all of my snmp configurations to non-default communities, settings, etc as snmp can be a big vulnerability in any network.  I'd highly recommend opsview as a set it and forget it solution - it works, and it works well. Though, observium is quite a bit more intuitive IMHO."

It's the sort of thing that gets more useful the longer you have it, mine has now become a hub for the whole house, media, docker containers, Web server and more.  With that in mind I would persevere with the idea a little and regarding your networking issue, have you considered powerline networking.  I've been using it since my first NAS and although it's not gigabit it does the job pretty well for media streaming to the wife and I.  They plug in to your electrical outlets and then you hook up an ethernet cable.  You can get them with passthrough so you don't lose the socket and can still plug your appliances in and you can even get them with multiple ethernet sockets and wifi access points built in.  You'd need one at your router and at least one more in the other location, and can add extra ones as required, just make sure they're compatible. ie from the same manufacturer and product line.  Hope that's of some help even if it doesn't answer all your questions."
homelab,3b3t8t,DrGrn,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:47:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the great answer!  Can you explain more about powerline networking? Is it a new outlet I have to install or does it just plug into an outlet? I have my router and computer on battery backups (separate ones as they're in separate spots) so how would that affect things?  Also, can you explain more about Unraid? Is that something I would use on my old computer I'd turn into a NAS? I think my biggest problem with using that old computer is there's not really any space to put it. I live in a small townhouse, and even if I bought a smaller case (it's currently sitting in a full tower NZXT Zero), the mobo is ATX so  I'm limited how small I can go"
homelab,3b3t8t,DrGrn,2,Fri Jun 26 12:19:29 2015 UTC,"Powerline is just plug with an ethernet port on it, check out the article here.  http://www.techradar.com/news/networking/powerline-networking-what-you-need-to-know-930691  Unraid is essentially a NAS OS that you put onto a USB and boot from, it then utilises all the HDD space for storage. The OS has a tiny footprint on the USB (Less than 200MB) and is hardware agnostic, so if you upgrade the CPU or motherboard, as long as all the data drives are present, it doesn't skip a beat.    An old i7 would run it admirably, and you can run apps in docker containers (think small virtual machines)   It has parity protection so for instance if you have three drives, nominate one as parity - then your system can tolerate the loss of any one of those drives and you won't lose data.  eg  Disk 1 dies => Recreate from disk 2 & parity Disk 2 dies => Recreate from disk 1 & parity Parity dies => Recreate parity from disk 1 & 2  There is a trial version available, but it's limited to the amount of data you can store on it (I think 250GB per disk?) but it's awesome and well worth every penny.  Check it out at Lime Technology and the user community over there is phenomenal and the friendliest most helpful bunch of guys on any internet forum I use, and I use a lot.  As regards your space issue - that I can't help you with mate..  EDIT: As far as Windows backups go, I use the Crashplan docker for Unraid to automatically backup all my Windows machines to my Unraid, no bother and happens automatically without me noticing.."

Sophos is a great product however, use whatever suits you.  Under 100 you're really looking at finding an old desktop or something super cheap and getting a wireless adapter for what you're asking.

homelab,3b1xgv,damiankw,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:51:42 2015 UTC,Forgive me if this is a silly question. I often hear that software RAID is a better option than hardware RAID unless you have a very high quality RAID card. Is this true? Would starting with a software RAID and adding a RAID card down the line be a solid option?
homelab,3b1xgv,evemanufacturetool,2,Thu Jun 25 09:09:54 2015 UTC,Only if the RAID card supports IT mode (just passes the disks through). ZFS is all the rage at the moment for software RAID. I'd highly recommend going down that route.
homelab,3b1xgv,ndboost,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:19:06 2015 UTC,Doing some more reading it sounds like software RAID should suit my needs. My question is will the two Intel Xeon E5120 Dual Core Processors be sufficient?
homelab,3b1xgv,YodaDaCoda,2,Thu Jun 25 09:57:34 2015 UTC,"more than sufficient.. when it comes to ZFS, processing power is not your bottleneck.. its memory"
homelab,3b1xgv,laboye,2,Thu Jun 25 14:14:29 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, the primary concern with hardware RAID cards is that when your card dies, you have to replace it with the exact same one, else you'll have to setup your array from scratch. If you use a high-quality RAID card, it's likely to be more popular, and therefore easier to find a replacement when you need one.  With software RAID, you only need to use the same disks and the software will sort everything out when you import your storage pool (or at least that's how Freenas works). I highly reccommend Freenas (which uses ZFS) as a software RAID solution.  Having said that, the system you've linked has only 8GB of ram, which would not be enough for a Freenas build (with ZFS, you want ~1GB of RAM per TB of storage for performance reasons) assuming you'd be putting minimum 1TB disks in every slot, you'd want at least 16GB of RAM. However, 8GB would be enough for some other (non-ZFS) software RAID solution (such as UnRaid)."
homelab,3b1xgv,HaliFan,2,Thu Jun 25 10:02:22 2015 UTC,"I know with Adaptec and 3ware (LSI), you just have to use a card in the same family with similar firmware. The RAID card does all of the math and whatnot and does track the drives, but the metadata for the arrays and volumes are on the disks themselves.  I've upgraded a 3ware 9550-8lp to a 12-port version and it worked great. Adaptec does it as well--just has to be a similar (ideally the exact same) firmware version."

Keep in mind it has 65W TDP CPUs, so you might want to swap them out for low-voltage versions like the 5138 (plenty of them on eBay). These CPUs are still nearly 10 years old, so they won't be as efficient as something newer, but they'll do the job for a storage server.  Be mindful of the drives you pick too. The heat & power from many drives can add up! I've found that WD Reds run pretty cool and have really never given me a problem.  The fully-buffered RAM takes up a bit more juice as well--the fewer modules, the better.  Depending on where you're putting it, you might want to get new fans as well--they're pretty feisty in this server (especially the PSU fans). The BIOS has selectable fan profiles, so you can change it to workstation and make it decent, but it's still up there.  Good luck and keep us posted!"

If the company you work for is a Microsoft Partner (Bronze, Silver, Gold), I think if you earn certifications for your company, the company gets x amount of licenses for internal use, they also get x amount of MSDN accounts, which if they are doing things right should go to the person who earned them.  If your company is a Microsoft Partner, have a chat with your manager and see if there's anything you can get :)"

Most people prefer iSCSI and it's generally a safer bet unless you're looking for a specific NFS feature.  EDIT: One of the major advantages of iSCSI is that it allows the client to run its own filesystem, such as VMWare's VMFS, that may be better suited to its purposes than NFS. On the other hand NFS is much more transparent between client and target and allows for the target to work with the client to optimize performance."

Many vendors push a 'best practice' based on their performance.  NetApp performance, for example, is nearly identical with NFS and iSCSI.  Any NetApp shop is likely running NFS."

homelab,3azssc,mhurron,0,Thu Jun 25 03:23:07 2015 UTC,How are you considering round robin MPIO (multiple connections from different nics to different IP's on the iSCSI target) different than NFS w/ LACP (multiple connections from different nics to different IP's on the NFS target)?
homelab,3azssc,just_insane,2,Thu Jun 25 03:27:33 2015 UTC,"Because iSCIs MPIO doesn't rely on anything on the network side at all, NFS does."

I bought the server because it was the best priced 2x 6core i could find and afford at that point. and the 6pcie slots and already 4 gigabit nic onboard seems to give me enough room to develop.  Single cpu newer generation servers were way mor expesive than the 660€ i was able to afford for my dual x5650 server at that point. Based on the readings . my power usage with Esxi is in between 125 - 150W steady depending on load.
homelab,3azn02,TexasDex,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:04:23 2015 UTC,32GB of ECC memory can cost around 300 new.  With that respectable CPU it sounds like a pretty good deal if it works properly.

Disabling it (SATA mode only) blasts the fans full speed (in a DL320e i have). Enabling it - you can only install centos 7.1 (exactly) on it because that's which driver works. No arrays defined - fans full blast. If you want md raid, you have to create two (or four) 1 disk raid 0s.   HP smart provisioning actually downgrades your firmware. Takes an hour to boot, and all your nerves to install an OS. If you plan to use wmvare or such, check if you have drivers for the B110i.  Otherwise good CPU, good price. But I would say stay the fuck away from any and all HP. With the fans running normally (the DL I mentioned) it has a pretty decent volume level, but still louder than a dell (T110II, R210II - these come in vanilla SATA).  Do not get X or E xeons. They are old, slow and loud (the systems) power hogs. A single E3 has far better performance than a dual setup of those."

As far as his noise concerns go, this is a tower that uses 80 and 92mm fans compared to the 40mm fans in his DL320e (small fans need to spin faster to move the same amount of air, and are therefore louder than larger fans). You should not have noise issues."

homelab,3azft0,WDKevin,2,Wed Jun 24 19:07:11 2015 UTC,+1 for MHDDFS. I've never seen anyone else using it before! I've been running it for about 2 years I absolutely love it.
homelab,3azft0,WDKevin,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:05:33 2015 UTC,"Woo!    I really love mhddfs. I don't need RAID, and it's so easy to add more drives. Works great!"
homelab,3azft0,WDKevin,2,Wed Jun 24 20:09:20 2015 UTC,"Exactly! I have a 1:1 copy of my NAS onsite and one offsite. I don't need RAID, what I need more is that when a drive goes bad I only lose the data on that drive and the rest of my NAS keeps working.  In fact, I've had one drive go bad. And when I pulled it out and put it on my SATA adapter and plugged it into another computer the drive worked fine. Thanks to it working as a standalone drive I was able hook it up elsewhere and get all the files off and back onto the NAS. In a RAID configuration I don't think I could have done that. At least not as easily."

When I built my NAS I already had the CPU, RAM and several mismatched hard drives so I just bought a 12-bay 4U case and a motherboard with as many SATA ports as I could find that worked with the CPU and RAM I already had. MHDDFS was perfect to maximize my storage pool.  You may have posted it but I'm on mobile and can't check. What OS do you use for your NAS? I'm using the TKL File Server with MHDDFS on top. I'm really happy with it but it would be nice to have some kind of interface to manage it but I'm very comfortable with the command line."

I'm not running anything that I needed a whole VM just for NAS. I just have all my drives mounted to the base ubuntu install and share them to my VMs with NFS. Then I just installed samba for my windows computers.    If you're looking for a good OS for NAS, try OpenMediaVault. It sounds like it would be perfect for you.

homelab,3azpsh,GoToMSP,2,Wed Jun 24 20:20:56 2015 UTC,"You can find the server cheaper by about $100. I just picked up this same TS140 for $299 on ebay, and tigerdirect has the larger TS440 available now for the same price (http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=9091972)  As for the HDDs, in my opinion 1TB drives just aren't economical now. For the same price as 4x 1TB you could get 2x 3TB which would give you more space and room for expansion. I'd put them in raid1, then if you were going to run Raid10 you'd lose out on some speed for 50% space gain, or vs raid5 you'd have the same space with two less drives and a clean copy of you data instead of stripes."
homelab,3azpsh,meowN,2,Wed Jun 24 22:47:03 2015 UTC,Do you see any advantage of the TS440 w/ 4 hot swap bays over the TS140?  The TS140 is quieter (not to say the TS440 is loud).  The motherboard is nearly identical.   The TS140 is a considerably easier form factor to mange (smaller).
homelab,3azpsh,canhazraid,2,Wed Jun 24 22:53:57 2015 UTC,"Main advantages I saw to the TS440 were more hard drive bays, dual PSUs, and different (better?) hardware raid support. For my small living space and budget, the TS140 fit what I was looking for."

Alot of times the ""used"" machines are just returns.    You will need harddrive caddies for the 1TB disks.  I dont know the part number.  If you are really going to run RAID10, consider white label RE4's off eBay from GoHardDrive.  Lots of folks on servethehome run them.  I have a bunch, ive had one DOA (which GoHardDrive replaced at their cost) and no problems afterwards.  You can pickup 4x2 TB RE4 for $200.  EVO is a nice fast disk.

I don't have a good suggestion with the existing setup off the top of my head but I would probably look for a smaller SSD to put in it, installed ESXi on that, turn the 1TB drive into a datastore for yours VM's and pass the 3TB through to a VM you create running FreeNAS or whatever flavor of NAS software you'd like. I would then create a VM for either Plex or Emby (or one for each so you can compare them) which will serve all of your media to the Xbox's, a Roku, Chromecast or pretty much anything else you want to stream it to. They both have a lot of support.  As for the remote desktop, you can simply open and port forward the RDP port on your router to the machine you want to connect to and that will take care of that. Another solution is to create a jump VM, basically a VM running Windows that you port forward the RDP to. You would connect to this VM and then RDP or SSH from there into any other servers on your network to manage them. However, I am not sure if you can RDP into a machine and not interupt the current user. I know it won't work if you use the same user account, I'm not sure if it will work with 2 different user accounts or not.  You won't need the Dreamhost account for any of this."

This will work for your RDP (It's an HTML5 clientless remote desktop program that can also do VNC and SSH/Telnet).  For plex, you can just install the plex media server on windows (the base OS for the HTPC?) and you are golden (well, you might have to forward a port, but that is easy enough), The only thing that might be a problem is if the port is blocked at the school, which would make it hard to stream. You can get around this by setting up a SSL VPN like OpenVPN (possibly on the same VM as Guacamole) which uses port 443."

Yes, you may have to configure your firewall to allow the iSCSI connection to link into the DMZ, but it should be significantly safer than running Samba across the two connections.  You will have to look into how best to set up the iSCSI connection if your Cloud Service needs access to the same files (For what it's worth, I wouldn't be hosting any files on a server in the DMZ, as it's all too easy for someone to get that stuff out, or replace it with something that isn't what you think it is) as my normal suggestion of lsblk would leave the ubuntu server seeing a large block file that iSCSI is mapping out.

homelab,3ay42x,pylori,3,Wed Jun 24 12:56:49 2015 UTC,"Uh, that's a big post with a lot of individual problems, so I'll answer them as I can.   from what I hear MS doesn't play that well with Linux, is that right?   No, it's not right. Not sure who told you that but Hyper-V and linux work fine together, I can personally attest to that.   Would it be better to pay a premium but ensure I won't need to think about upgrades in case I want more horsepower out of the system.   Since I don't know what you plan to be doing with your VMs, I'm going to go with my default answer of: My virtual hosts are never CPU locked unless I have a runaway process on a server. They are, however, always in search of more memory. Take it as you want it.   I didn't really understand why people were saying it's not worth the risk   Because you will lose data, and you will cause yourself a measure of stress that no human should endure. If you put your hypervisor on a box, then stack FreeNAS for ZFS on top of that box and directly pass through your hard drives to FreeNAS as you will ~need~ to do for ZFS to really be a worthwhile effort, then put more VMs on the same box, you also create a chicken-and-egg scenario if you ever have to restart the box. The Hypervisor will come up, FreeNAS will have to come up, and provide it's storage BACK to the hypervisor (FreeNAS will need to be somewhere else) before any VMs that use FreeNAS's storage would be able to boot up without issues. Yes there are ways you can make it work, but why spend the time to make that work when there are other, better, easier, and less error-prone ways of handling that.   Also does the flash backup cache mean it's 'safer' in the event of loss of power or kernel panic vs ZFS?   Kernel Panic, yes, power loss, sortof. Your file server should have a UPS and should be able to gracefully power down if power is lost. Pulling power on a spinning disk is bad for their health, and even more so if you plan to have RAID5. Your worst fear should be that box ever powering off un-gracefully. My home RAID5 has done it a few times and survived, but I've RFB'd plenty of boxes that haven't been so lucky.   Anyway, any advice would be much appreciated, thanks!   My advice is to get the raid card, RAID your disks, provide them to the hypervisor, and simplify your setup. Do not overcomplicate things that do not need to be overcomplicated, like using FreeNAS on a hypervisor. FreeNAS can be a great tool in the right scenario (I'm still considering replacing my Centos7 file server with a FreeNAS box providing iSCSI to a windows file server VM) but think of adding complications in the same way as you think of it in other scenarios. When you buy just a toaster...it toasts pretty well, and when it breaks you have a good idea of why it's broken. If you buy a toaster/dishwasher/refridgerator/microwave combo unit, and suddenly it develops this odd tendency of refrigerating food you want to toast...well, good luck figuring out how to program the Microwave's clock, man."
homelab,3ay42x,oldspiceland,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:04:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to reply, I appreciate your comments.   Since I don't know what you plan to be doing with your VMs, I'm going to go with my default answer of: My virtual hosts are never CPU locked unless I have a runaway process on a server. They are, however, always in search of more memory. Take it as you want it.   I'm maxing out the RAM at 16GB so I can't move up from there, which is why I was wondering on the CPU front. The sorts of stuff I am looking to do include running shared media storage accessible for the local network, Sophos UTM (though this is more messing around for now since I have no real need for it), some linux distros for various low intensive purposes like hosting VPN server to connect remotely into the system, sickbeard/couchpotato to download and maintain TV show catalogue, webserver. Nothing too crazy, being new to this virtualisation stuff I just wasn't sure what CPU is necessary, I just knew that the celeron wasn't really ideal for running esxi with VMs because of a lack of VT-d. I wanted to hear from someone who knows what these processors are capable of to know if I am making a decent choice or shooting too high for my needs.   before any VMs that use FreeNAS's storage would be able to boot up without issues.   But this is only if I use the FreeNAS storage for storing the VMs, right? I wanted my main (or all, if possible) VMs to be stored on the separate SSD, and only use FreeNAS for the main spinning drives. Then basically just use those drives as a storage pool for shared data like movies, etc, ie) nothing that the VMs would need to boot. Is this a better arrangement that avoids those issues?  I mean to be honest I was planning on doing that with the RAID controller anyway, I just wanted a sense of understanding the problems of FreeNAS so I am aware. I think I'm going to stick with the hardware raid, I just wanted to make sure I wasn't unnecessarily buying it if I could reasonably avoid it.  Thanks again."
homelab,3ay42x,oldspiceland,3,Wed Jun 24 23:27:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is a better setup, but FreeNAS has some quirks.   1.) You need to pass the disks directly through to FreeNAS to make the effort of setting FreeNAS up worth anything. This means that you need to do direct-pass-through of those disks to the FreeNAS VM, and if you use an add-on card for RAID it will need to be firmware flashed to work only as an HBA (Host-Bus Adapter, essentially a dumb set of extra SATA ports). Depending on your hypervisor, this can range from rock-solid to a tiny bit flakey...but the problem is that the passthrough must work 100% of the time, or else you get to problem   2.) FreeNAS adds a performance and utility increase in two situations: Huge amounts of data that would otherwise be unwieldy in more conventional situations, or data that needs to be accessed repeatedly in a high-intensity low-downtime environment. This is what it was designed to do, and it does that superbly well. However, RaidZ2/ZFS is not some magic cure-all, and especially in situations where FreeNAS is virtualized with pass-through, adds undue risks to the equation that FreeNAS is supposed to actually avoid. FreeNAS when run bare-metal on a box, or in a virtualization environment where the disks are attached to the VM in such a manner where there is no difference between virtualized and non-virtualized, is capable of self-healing errors on it's drive arrays as well as a variety of other things that make it a superb choice. However the way it handles this, and does this, is also why it requires that direct connection to the drive.  3.) The other reason why FreeNAS and ZFS add such a huge performance increase is because it soaks through quite a tremendous amount of system resources. The ~minimum~ system requirements for FreeNAS are a Multicore processor and 8GB of ram. Given that this is /r/homelab and especially in your situation with the setup you're proposing, that is going to soak the majority of your available resources into having a bare-bones FreeNAS box. I don't see a benefit to that. Virtualization really shines by dividing out a large host with massive system resources into multiple VMs that require significantly less system resources. Building four single-core boxes with 1GB of ram to run CentOS7 for my internal lab utility servers would be cost and power and space prohibitive. Instead all four of those live on the same dual-core, 8GB of ram box that also houses my secondary domain controller and a windows file server.  The short version of the story is this: ZFS is excellent in situations that a normal software/hardware RAID setup would flounder, but is dramatically overkill in situations where a normal software/hardware RAID would be perfectly fine.  Also, for what it's worth, I use core2-duo and core i3's for my current trio of virtual hosts, each with 8GB of ram running Hyper-V. Yeah, I could do better if I had Xeons and TS140s and 16GB of RAM, but these are leftover small form factor Dells that would otherwise be seeing the long end of the recycling line, and it works great for me. Unless you're doing something that's really CPU intensive, the lower-cost Xeon will likely be fine for you."
homelab,3ay42x,Skallox,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:38:43 2015 UTC,Question: Do do all the ZFS truth bombs you just dropped apply to BTRFS as well? Cyberjock successfully convinced me to never virtualize freenas so it will always be solo. I do want to experiment with BTRFS and am planning to do so with an HBA passthrough.
homelab,3ay42x,oldspiceland,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:11:02 2015 UTC,"~to my knowledge~ btrfs does not require direct access to disks because it works differently than ZFS does. To that end, btrfs is a great file system for reasons like snapshots and subvolumes and it's integrated RAID1/RAID10 implementation as well as it's ability to handle large storage volumes. To be clear, the use cases for ZFS and btrfs aren't identical and the decision to use one or the other should really hinge on what you need out of the file system and your available resources. ZFS can certainly do a lot of the same things as btrfs, sometimes better, but as noted it has it's own drawbacks.  To that end, it's never a bad idea to limit your drive array stack to as few levels as possible, since an HBA is simply a direct connection, it doesn't add a layer to the system. btrfs isn't going to be penalized by using HBAs, though I have used btrfs on virtual hard disks with no issues with VMs as well. If you want to experiment with btrfs to learn it's ins and outs, you could do so by creating multiple VHDs and tying all of them to a single VM, then having that VM do that. You'll get a performance penalty but if you're doing this in a lab-only environment for learning that isn't going to be a big deal. (Plus, added benefit of not having to frequently resilver drives/arrays when you screw up.)"
homelab,3ay42x,Skallox,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:20:36 2015 UTC,Thanks!    As a home user and hobbyist the appeal of BTRFS is the reduction in first cost and sticker shock that can come from building a NAS around ZFS.    I will primarily be testing the scale-ability of BTRFS in a raid5/6 configuration.  I figured I would get the most real world experience by running it on virtualized ubuntu via HBA.

I mount my ZFS export back onto my Hypervisor using VMXNET3 adapter and it's all handled directly on the vSwitch. Just for shits and grins I booted both a live drive of Solaris and FreeNAS and was able to do a ZFS import.   Lastly, I have all file my NFS exports mounted onto my Windows 10 HTPC and I use Crashplan unlimited to back up that ""1"" computer, that has all things mounted to it.

homelab,3avp1p,dxm765,2,Wed Jun 24 20:44:46 2015 UTC,Why do you need physically shared SAS for that? There are plenty of virtual SAN setups using 10 gigE to replicate data between hosts. Two separate servers are always better then single CiB.  P.S. If you absolutely want CiB go SuperMicro. They have some pretty good and very inexpensive ones.

homelab,3auitv,SirMaster,3,Tue Jun 23 17:47:20 2015 UTC,"Proxmox is pretty sraight forward kind of similar to ESX, just boot from the proxmox ISO and you will get a setup menu. It will basically as you which drive you want to install Proxmox too and then ask you to set the IP and root Password.   The best thing is that you can create a ZFS array in the setup window when you choose your drives, which is really cool as no one else does this right now.   If you want to run containers I would suggest try 4.0 even though its BETA, as they have dropped OpenVZ containers completely in 4.0. So if you setup some containers on 3.4, you will have to migrate them from VZ to LXC when they release the final version of 4.0.   If your not bothered about containers and just want to run KVM then just go with 3.4 for now its very stable, so you won't get any nasty surprises.   PM me if you need help with something specific, I should be able to help with most general things concerining proxmox.   Also take note of the following I just pulled from proxmox forum.   All beta1 installations can be updated to 4.0 stable without any problem Currently there is no upgrade path from 3.4 to 4.0 beta1, the upgrade script will be provided later LXC is not yet feature complete, work in progress Ceph packages for Jessie are not yet available"

homelab,3auitv,Anon_8675309,2,Wed Jun 24 02:02:33 2015 UTC,"I think it's just because OpenVZ has had no active development now and the main focus is towards LXC as it's under active development.

homelab,3aulcx,uronlisunshyne,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:06:17 2015 UTC,"I wanted the TS440 YUX because of the processor when it was around $370. It has 2 drive bays for a total of 8 drives. I honestly didn't need that much but it was tempting since it was cheaper and more powerful. Now prices have gone up substantially so I'm reeling in my expectations and going with only what I need.

homelab,3au2yk,treos33,7,Tue Jun 23 14:51:03 2015 UTC,"If reliability and data integrity is crucial and you are using a RAID setup, I don't think non-ECC would be an option as it just takes one instance to risk losing the whole raid - a wise man once said That being said; I'm not a fan of a RAID setup for a home media server.  I personally use DriveBender for my media center backbone running on a Windows Server 2012 install, but storage spaces should work.  DriveBender is very flexible and if there is stuff I would like to ensure doesnt get lost there is a file-level redundancy duplication option. Your existing i5 setup should have no issues doing what you want to do.  I'm suspecting there is some kind of bottleneck with your E8400 setup as I would imagine that would handle transcoding 1080p fine.    A homelab is exactly what it says, a lab for your home.  For some people it's a simple old desktop running linux and for others it's much more than what the average small business has. It's something that fullfills a need.  I would love to have a full rack or two like some of the folks here but it'd really be wasteful.  I now get the most enjoyment out of doing more with less. Both those Intel CPU's support VT-x & VT-d so you're not limited by that. There is a group that will say ECC only, and there are supporters of the % chance of an error causing total loss of RAID is so slim that a backup is suffice.  I'd run with what you have right now, try out some stuff and make it work the best that you can for what you want to do, you WILL eventually exhaust that and at that time, look at spending some $$ on some enterprise stuff when you have a much better understanding of what you want to do, and what you need to achieve that. A BackBlaze subscription is probably cheaper than moving to ECC to backup that ZFS RAID if you're really set on using FreeNAS."

Yea it's slower, but you can add a cache drive for helping speed up transfers to it.  As long as you do FULL memory test (memtest) and hard drive test (pre-clear) you shouldn't have to worry about ecc memory."

You can run KVM and/or Dockers and pretty much do anything you want.  v6 was a huge release for them. It is really nice to use as many random size drives as you want as long as the largest drive is the parity drive.  And it does work on very minimal hardware. I'd go that way...
homelab,3au2yk,smdion,2,Tue Jun 23 15:47:15 2015 UTC,I've been running ZFS on Linux for quite a long while now with non-ECC RAM without an issue. The key (and this always applies when dealing with important data) is to have a reliable backup. RAID is not a substitute for backups.  You can further reduce the chance of memory issues being a problem by running Memtest86+ on your memory for 24 hours before installing FreeNAS (or whatever your choice of OS).  To answer your TLDR: I'd said RAIDZ2 would be more reliable than Unraid with 1 parity as it will survive up two disk failures where Unraid would only survive one.

I'm not sure how this works with ESXi, but it's worth some research.  Have you measured the peak power draw of the whole setup while booting?  That's the figure you need to make sure you cover.  It can easily be twice your idle draw.  1500VA is probably not a bad idea; that will cover pretty much anything you can connect to a normal household outlet.  The dimming lights are pretty typical when running a high draw appliance such as a laser printer.  Some UPSes (particularly ""On-line"" ones) will protect your other appliances from that if it's severe enough.  However, it sounds like if you add much more to that circuit the printer may start to trip the circuit breaker.  Laser printers actually use lots of power (hence the lights dimming) and require a really big beefy UPS, so it's generally not considered worthwhile to plug a printer into one."
homelab,3av1c2,TexasDex,2,Tue Jun 23 19:33:47 2015 UTC,I picked up a 1500VA Cyberpower UPS and it seems to be pretty good unit for what I spent.

homelab,3av1c2,spiralout112,2,Wed Jun 24 02:40:18 2015 UTC,"I would put the printer on another circuit. Don't try to use a battery backup on a laser printer. They are too power hungry. If it's a network printer and network is stopping you from placing it, say, in the garage, you could use an old linksys 54g router flashed with DDWRT to act as a ""client bridge"" essentially giving your printer (and 4 other devices) wireless functionality to their ethernet ports.

Outside of that you will probably want to plan on average usage X up time needed, to size your UPS.  Anything other than getting your stuff shut down in a few minutes is going to be spendy.  You can always put low power stuff like your telecom, on a small UPS.  Put the power hungry servers on a larger UPS.  This is what I have going.  Edit: splitting the UPS allows my telcom to be up during extended outages so I can make phone calls in an emergency.  While the servers dont need to stay up more then a few minutes to shut down cleanly."

You can cross-check some of that; the R710 will show you it's power draw (in W, not VA, but they should be close) on the front panel and via the iDRAC. (Are you measuring with one PSU connected, or both?)  There can be significant different between 'on and idle' versus 'running CPU at full on all cores'. Similarly with disk activity.  As others have mentioned, look at apcupsd and nut to coordinate shutdowns. Some UPSes use serial or USB, others are network-enabled and just use SNMP.  Also, if you're using auto-power-on on the R710, look at the options (hidden under Security in the BIOS) for delayed restart -- have it wait a minute or two to come back on after a power failure, to reduce inrush current (and give network devices some more time to boot first)."

homelab,3av756,NetworkMagician,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:02:01 2015 UTC,"As you appear to know, you will need two bridges for the two physical interfaces.  For clarity, I name my bridges lan0, wan0, san0, etc..  I found when setting up my KVM host, I had to build one small piece at a time and then test it before moving on the pieces built on top of it.  If I tried everything in one shot, I would screw it up good.  If eth1 is the interface you normally use to access this machine, create a lan0 bridge, copy the eth1 configuration stanzas to it, remove all eth1 configuration and set it as a bridge_port of lan0.  Reboot.  See if you still access the LAN via the new lan0 bridge with eth1 as a member.  If not, check ifconfig looking for the ""UP"" flag for both eth1 and lan0.  If eth1 does not come up simply as a member of lan0, you may need to add ""iface eth1 inet manual"" or similar.  I use LACP on my host, and the member interfaces require no configuration at all, they come up as part of the LAG.    For the wan0 side, I would set it up the same with eth0 as a bridge_port, but absolutely set wan0 as ""iface wan0 inet manual"" or static and give it no configuration, you don't necessarily want it getting an address from the router/cable modem.  Then go into virt-manager and set lan0 as the bridge interface for the pfSense LAN interface and wan0 as the bridge interface for your pfSense WAN interface and test it out.  EDIT for narrative: I actually gave up running my edge router in a VM years ago, it simply had too many chicken and egg issues.  I bought myself a MikroTik RB2011 and have never looked back.  My virt hosts and network infrastructure are separated save for the single UPS that runs everything.  The network infrastructure can power cycle and restore on it's own, which keeps the wife happy in case of power outages."

You NEVER want to go this high, and if you hit 100% your ZFS pool is likely to tank.  You want to aim for 80% usage (that is, capacity used).

We don't have a set on call schedule,  but we back each other as needed.  We make sure to build redundancy as best as we can with our budget to avoid this happening too often.   I spend my lunch break running or exercising.  I have an hour lunch, if my workout goes long,  i just eat at my desk.   I will spend some time at work reading up on things that can help us,  or i feel i need to learn more of.  Maybe 5 hours total of my week.  My last company would encourage more time doing these things, and we were a 2 man team.    I try to get to work at 7 or 730 so i can avoid traffic and be home earlier.

If your employer allows that,  I'd suggest doing it!   2 hours each day might be too high of a goal for lab unless you can steal work time.  Maybe do 2 hours 3 time per week,  maybe 3 of those hours on a Saturday morning when your family is sleeping in.    I do this and still manage to clean my house regularly,  work on house projects,  go out 2-3 times with friends,  and continue to grow and learn.    I like your idea of listening to podcast during the commute, I'm going to try that!   Also,  i sleep about 6 - 6.5 hours per night,  going to bed at midnight might give you and your wife time without kids,  and as long as you figure out your rem cycle,  you can still awake refreshed.    12 hours per week in traffic seems crazy,  have you considered moving closer? Or getting a job closer to home? Maybe finding a new employer who understands giving you study time would help if your current employer frowns on it would be of help?"

homelab,3aq8d8,canhazraid,4,Tue Jun 23 02:36:00 2015 UTC,With 32GB ram you could run 8 4GB VM's.  16 2GB VM's or 32 1 GB VM's or 64 512MB VM's without resource contention.

homelab,3aq8d8,GoToMSP,2,Tue Jun 23 06:03:56 2015 UTC,"Is the raid card fine on this or would you suggestion another to replace it?   The RAID card is fine for spinny disks in RAID1.  It doesnt support RAID5/6 without a key.  Even then, it has no onboard memory and is a bit slow.  It doesnt support TLER, so you will need SSD's with onboard TLER (sandforce based SSD's).   Its a great HBA when flashed to IT mode.   Whats the best way to create the array/raid to combine SSD and HDD?    You don't.  You create seperate drive pools.   What would be the perfect ram to purchase for this?    Whatever ram meeds its spec.  I personally ran non-ecc in mine because I was ok with that, but I would recommend ecc ram.   Lets say I run 5-6 VM, how often would I run into the CPU bottle necking?    Impossible to tell you -- its based on workload.  You could run 100 idle VM's, or 1 VM that uses 100% of your CPU."

homelab,3aq8d8,GoToMSP,2,Tue Jun 23 19:07:12 2015 UTC,"A RAID card exposes virtual devices to the hardware and generally wont export raw disks.  It wont let commands hit the disks directly (such as TRIM), but rather proxies them.  A HBA will expose raw devices (like your motherboard) and not allow raid.  Some RAID controllers will pass through disks when they are individually setup as JBOD devices."

homelab,3aq8d8,iRawrz,2,Mon Jun 22 18:38:29 2015 UTC,"I don't see why it wouldn't be, but the TS440 has the 2 SAS Backplanes that make it great. Just run the mini SAS connector to the backplanes and all 8 bays are good to go.  While it's probably compatible with the TS140, I don't see it as being practical. The TS140 only has room for 4 drives, and unless you are using SAS drives you can just connect those to the motherboard."

Is this a learning experience or a lab that runs simply without having to learn some more stuff . this will tell you synolagy vs building one. Vm storage will come down to load and usage raid 1 won't really task your processor so network speed could be your bottle neck so you may want to look into trunking or having your plex server data on the nas and the os partition on the virtualization server.  Keep in mind raid is not backups but alot of people have automated backups to off site servers
homelab,3apaw3,fall4free,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:06:49 2015 UTC,"Ideally it would be used for both learning and having some stuff run. I'm currently running Plex and VMs off my desktop.  I'm only using a regular Buffalo router with DDWRT so trunking isn't an option unless I get more hardware.  I know RAID by itself isn't a backup, but currently my data is divided between my computer and some older USB HDDs. I would like to make at least another copy and RAID would allow for that."
homelab,3apaw3,premierplayer,3,Mon Jun 22 13:39:39 2015 UTC,FREENAS you can build your own. You can also use XPenology (synology but free)  Re-silver times vary depending on the type of raid/disks. Being a homelab why are you concerned?

ZFS (FreeNAS filesystem of choice) doesn't require downtime to rebuild, provided of course that the hardware you are using supports hotswapping of disks. Even before you know disk 1 of 2 has failed/is corrupt, ZFS knows which side of the mirror has the correct data and continues serving only this correct data to the client. Even if you need to restart, you can still be serving files while the pool rebuilds, invisible to the clients. Which is nice.  As for rebuild time, ZFS (and it's kin) will always have optimal duration, as it knows which blocks of the disks are actually used vs. free. In this way, if you're only using 25% capacity, you only transfer 25% of blocks to get the new drive up to sync.   I've also read that there is a higher chance of a second disk failing when rebuilding.   This is a problem shared by any RAID, which is why you are encouraged to use a parity arrangement that can tolerate up to two failures without loss. That said, in the event of any partial data loss of the sort one may encounter during a rebuild gone wrong, a ZFS-like filesystem puts you in a good position. ZFS knows which individual files are or are not okay, and will list them for you, in contrast to some RAID products which are limited to a binary all-or-nothing resilver success.  With ZFS and it's naughty-or-nice list, you have the option to keep only those known good files, then differential-restore the ones that got borked from your backup, saving time getting back to normal.  There are non-ZFS things that do some or all of that as well, but FreeNAS offers an approachable and affordable way to get access to all of that data integrity goodness with a decent management interface."
homelab,3apaw3,nogodsorkings1,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:27:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. ZFS looks like the way to go for this. From what I've read I think (some?) the pre-built are all or nothing approach, which may be why I have been getting information for anywhere from 20hours to 25days for rebuild.   If I were to go with custom built, would an integrated cpu motherboard be able to do a plex stream and 2-3 vms at the same time? Or would I need to get something similar to my current desktop build (i5)? I've also considered if just building a smaller desktop and turning the current one into the NAS would be overkill for my needs. Either soon staying with another DDR3 build or once DDR4 becomes available in smaller boards? Not sure if it's such a good time to still be building DDR3."
homelab,3apaw3,premierplayer,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:46:58 2015 UTC,"The CPU requirements of ZFS are trivial for most workloads, but if you intend to host Plex and its transcoding on the fileserver itself, you might want something modest for that. It all depends on the applications you want this box to be able to run; The overhead for ZFS itself is trivial for most needs. The only thing that ZFS wants lots of is RAM - the rule of thumb is about 1 GB per TB of storage, which isn't much these days. I see no compelling reason to wait for DDR4.  Keep in mind that FreeNAS, as an appliance-focused distribution, does limit you in some ways. Alternatively, some people just install ZFS and filesharing on the Linux distro of their choice so they have access to the full universe of applications, rather than just those that have been packaged for FreeNAS.  I am running 5 VMs, a standard fileshare with lots of stuff, and one or two HD streams off of my 8-disk, 16 TB zpool and have been loving it for a long while. The filesystem is robust as hell and the box never breaks a sweat."
homelab,3apaw3,WDKevin,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:22:20 2015 UTC,"My apologies but I may have left some details. I was thinking about DDR4 because larger dimms are available on it. Going the DDR4 route would be using the current computer for the NAS then building a new desktop with DDR4 for the added max ram. My current z87-pro is limited to 32gb, which should be more than enough for the NAS. But for the main machine running VMs + other stuff, it can become more limited."

homelab,3apaw3,dismorphic,4,Mon Jun 22 13:52:52 2015 UTC,"I know RAID isn't a back up. But I'm planning to use it to keep an extra copy of my data. It's not ideal but it's one way to keep another copy of data. One set on my desktop, one with RAID on a NAS. It's not 3 copies with 2 different formats and 1 off-site, but it's a starting point to have when budget is limited."
homelab,3apaw3,dismorphic,2,Mon Jun 22 14:11:12 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of the same boat as you, but here is what I currently have. Then I'll go into my own questions.  I have a stand alone NAS (custom built running TKL File Server w/ MHDDFS to create a JBOD pool) and this houses all of my files. I have a VM host with a smallish disk that runs VMWare. I currently store my VM files on the same drive as VMWare. On my NAS I have a public share called backups. I have a Veeam VM that backs up my VM's to the backup share as well as run Areca on my desktop to backup important files that are stored directly on there.  My current situation is an external backup and if I should move my VM's to the NAS. Right now I am writing an rsync script to sync my backups share from the NAS to a VPS from Backupsy, though I am considering looking into Amazon Glacier but that would likely require me to write my own interface since you can't rsync to that service. I would like to move my VM's into a datastore that is housed on my NAS as well but I am worried about transfer speeds. So I am trying to find out the best (aka fastest) method to share that datastore to the VM host. Currently I just have a single Gbit NIC on the NAS and the VM host would read from that. I don't know if this is fast enough or if there is a better solution. Ultimately I would like to move the datastore to the NAS and then have the entire NAS (including the backups share but not including my media like movies, TV shows and music) backed up off site. This would require a larger VPS from Backupsy which is why I am considering Glacier instead. Crashplan is another option but as far as I am aware this would require another VM with a Linux GUI that then has the entire NAS mounted to it so that it could be backed up to Crashplan. I'm not aware of a way to backup to Crashplan from the command line directly from the NAS but if there was this could seriously change my plans.  I know this doesn't help much but it gives you another users current plan and issues they are facing that sounds somewhat similar to what you planned. If there is anything I can explain further or answer to help you, let me know!"

They both support SSD-read/write cache, have quad-NICS, and have optional expansion racks (from 4 to 8 bays, and from 12 to 24 bays),   I haven't used QNAP before, but they and Synology are considered the ""top-dogs"" in the entry-level NAS market.

homelab,3aqjsl,aerofly0610,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:01:52 2015 UTC,"You can, but I wouldn't recommend it. Depending on the system, it will pull a bit of power from both PSUs simultaneously, which would throw off your UPS's running-time calculations.   For example: let's say the NAS draws 150w, 75 from each PSU. The UPS calculates run time based off of 75w draw. Power shuts off and now the NAS is pulling all 150w from the UPS - double what the UPS expected, cutting the run time in half.  Also, what if the PSU that is plugged into the UPS is slowly failing and not able to supply the full 150w, but not so far failed to have made it apparent to you. Then the power cuts out, taking the NAS down with it.  In an ideal world, I would have the two PSUs plugged into two UPSs and each UPS plugged into a separate circuit breaker, but that's not always practical :)"

You are also pretty much limited to quad core CPUs since dual core VT-d capable CPUs are very rare and expensive.  If power usage was not an issue than going with an AMD setup would cost significantly less initially.

Turns out MS put some pretty heavy restrictions on the type of thumb drives that can be used, they have to report themselves as non-removable.  The TechNet article references those models, and they aren't cheap.  I found a way around that, I used a micro-sd card to USB converter, cheap from amazon.  It's physical format looks just like a thumb drive after the card is inserted.  It was a while ago, and I don't have my notes handy, but some googling should show you how to flip some bits on the micro-sd card so that it reports itself as non-removable.  Then just follow that how-to guide and it just works.  Further complication on my end, my TS140s don't have an internal USB A female port.

Otherwise, the hardware gets in the way of ZFS doing optimal self-healing, load balancing, and most of its other features which are the likely reason you're using ZFS in the first place.  IIRC, a RAID card with IT firmware behaves like an HBA. You just paid extra for the hw which isn't used with that firmware.  I've had good experience with my LSISAS 1068E SAS controller, but that's pci-e x4 IIRC.

For example i have a supermicro 4U superchassis with the 24 drive backplane, you can then connect backplane to backplane if you want, or what i plan to do is get another M1015 (JBOD) and connect chassis 1 to chassis 2 via SFF8088 cables externally, and then change that SFF8088 to a SFF8087 with a PCI backplate and call it a day, but i would use 2 ports on my expander  P.S.

You'd need another psu in that other node 804 case, and if power were to fail and come back youd need to make sure both cases power up so either youre personally going to hit the power button on both, or you could use something like this add2psu plus one of these external molex now you'd need 2 of those external molex PCI brackets 1 for each node. Then when your primary node fires up it will send power through the PCI bracket to the other node (again through the bracket) and give signal for the add2psu adapter to turn the other PSU on and spin up the hdds in that node. This may not be the most elegant way....but it works.  EDIT: and depending if you got a external card, this would go on the second node 804 system Internal to external SAS"

I don't really see a reason to have a ""mobile server"" this powerful and this expensive, in the form of a laptop.  Most of the time when I think of a laptop server I think of an old laptop repurposed as a home server. This is usually done because of a lack of money to buy a tower home server.  You could buy a small tower server for $1700, that would be much better then this laptop. May not be as mobile as this laptop but who cairs? Do you honestly want to be walking around with you server? All I want out of a mobile server is, small enought I can carry it on location put it where there is power and network connections, Then it will stay there until we leave the location.

homelab,3ahwc2,SL89,6,Sat Jun 20 16:00:57 2015 UTC,"I run both. I pass through the HDD to a linux VM so that I can spin it down - it wouldn't do it with ESXi, it kept accessing it roughly once a minute. I pulled my hair out trying to work out whether it was logging, caching, or something else. I think on reflection ESXi does it intentionally just to stop drives spinning down because it is an enterprise tool.  I use the HDD to store ISOs for the VM install media, a seafile install, and various storage for any of the VMs that need more than the small amounts they get provisioned (eg: the paper server scans and outputs to an NFS share which it shares back to me over SMB).  I didn't find a particularly great place to mount the SSD in the case, I don't have a 3.5 to 2.5 inch converter, so I used some cable ties."

Instead the motherboard has a couple 4-pin 12V outputs, which can't really meet the power needs for much more than what comes with the system.

homelab,3ahlxh,arctichenry,2,Sat Jun 20 06:43:59 2015 UTC,"I bought this motherboard for $55 after rebate a few months ago.  I'm running it now in my NAS and it works great.  I was previously using an Atom 330 system (also dirt cheap) and kept the same OS install and hardware other than the MB/CPU, SATA cards, and RAM.  I'm not doing any virtualization on it and I'm running Gentoo Linux.  It is working out great as a NAS and general purpose home server.  CPU speed is easily overkill for NAS work, it has a good 16GB RAM limit, USB3, and low electricity usage.  Compare that to my old Atom motherboard which had a good-enough CPU but 2 GB ram limit, USB2, and only a single PCI (not express!) slot that was filled by a SATA card.  I mostly upgraded to get USB3 and multiple PCIe slots ... and because the upgrade was cheap.  Asrock q1900m = $55 2x SATA cards = $65  I used 2 of these 4 port PCIe 2.0 1x SATA 3 cards:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AZ9T3OU  Now my NAS has 9 hot-swap SATA bays + 1 internal SATA connection and USB3 support for even more external drives.  There are currently 12 hard drives connected (some on USB3).  The limited expansion ability of my old Atom NAS has been nicely solved.    The system with 9 internal hard drives connected is currently pulling 80 watts (there are also 3 USB3 hard drives not being counted in the power usage).  Since you mention 10Gb NIC and a RAID card, it sounds like you're looking for something higher performance than I cared about.  The one thing I would caution you about is the PCIe speed.  There are 3 PCIe 2.0 slots.  All 3 of these are 1x speed.  Two of them are 1x physically and one is 16x physically.  This means that each slot is capable of 500 Megabytes (4 gigabits) per second.  The ""16x"" slot is not 16x speed.  It is only 16x physically, but 1x in speed.  If you think about it, this means I am connecting 4 hard drives with 6 gigabit SATA connections for a total of 24 gigabits of potential SATA bandwidth into a PCIe slot capable of 4 gigabits.  Yep.  However, the reality is that my hard drives (mostly WD greens) are capable of about 100 Megabytes.  that makes 400 Megabytes per 4-port SATA card, which is within the 500 Megabytes the PCIe slot is capable of.  This works out fine for me (easily handles home NAS tasks at great speeds), but if you were hoping for SSD speeds or 10 Gb NICs you might be disappointed."

homelab,3ahlxh,PriceZombie,1 point,Sat Jun 20 12:34:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!   Regarding transfer speeds, I was considering 10gbit with ssds attached to the onboard sata2 slots.   I see it supports virtualization, but seems like esxi flips out. Any ideas on why that is?  If you could, would you buy one again? What are some improvements one could make?"
homelab,3ahlxh,mattbuford,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:14:13 2015 UTC,"When using SSDs, adding a 10gig NIC will potentially be faster than the built in 1gig NIC, but keep in mind  you will never be able to get more than 4gig out of that 10gig NIC since you are plugging it into a 4gig PCIe 2.0 1x slot.  You don't have any expansion options here that will support the full speed of a 10gig NIC.  I don't really know what the issue is with ESXi.  I googled around and couldn't find anyone saying it doesn't work (other than the poster in this thread that said he has a similar, but not the same, motherboard).  Anyway, sure, I'd buy it again, but that really depends on needs.  The fact that there are no slots faster than PCIe 2.0 1x (4 gbps) is probably the only thing that I would say is potentially a problem on it.  It all depends on your performance needs.  For me, the limitation was still higher than my drives can push anyway so it doesn't matter for my use case.  4 RAM slots would have been nice.  I actually had 4 x 4 GB sticks lying around when I built the system.  Since there are 2 slots, I could only put 2 of those sticks in there.  Maybe someday I'll buy 2 x 8 GB sticks and max it out.  Overall though, the system was incredibly cheap and great value.  I like that I can throw such a crazy high number of hard drives into my NAS.  I basically dug through all my old hardware and threw every old HD I could find into there.  :)"
homelab,3ahlxh,AnimalFarmPig,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:38:22 2015 UTC,I have the exact same board. The ESXi installer hangs during boot. ESXi pre-installed also hangs during boot.
homelab,3ahlxh,machbio,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:12:02 2015 UTC,"the first review for the controller says, it can only reach speeds of 240MBps, Could you explain - how you are able to get 400MBps.. I know that on a PCIe 2.0 Slots you get 500MBps per lane, but is it practical.."
homelab,3ahlxh,mattbuford,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:25:03 2015 UTC,"I can't completely explain his low results, but part of it may be that he was testing with a single drive.  I don't have any SSDs in my system, and my HDs are even relatively slow WD green drives.  My tests are also going to be a bit slowed down because this is a live system with other reads/writes happening on the disks while I run the tests...  I just started sequential reads on all 4 drives at the same time attached to one of these cards and I got a total of 326.9 MB/s combining all 4 drives.  Testing each disk individually, I get 80-85 MB/s.  Testing an identical disk attached to the motherboard's SATA2 port gives me around 80 MB/s, reliably just a little slower than the drives attached to the PCIe card.  So, the math roughly works out and all 4 drives running together can do 4x the speed of 1 drive, and 1 drive on this card is roughly the same as 1 drive on the motherboard's SATA.  This tells me the card and PCIe slot are not significant bottlenecks even when all 4 drives are working hard at the same time, at least for these slow drives."
homelab,3ahlxh,AnimalFarmPig,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:45:18 2015 UTC,"I have that board. I was really excited when I ordered it. Turns out that it doesn't run ESXi, like other mentioned. The lack of SATA ports and the single PCIe lane per slot are also annoying. Performance is also underwhelming.  I'd really suggest looking at ASRock's AM1B and AM1H motherboard for AMD's AM1 socket. I bought one J1900 board and one AM1B board + processor this past winter. I now have three systems running AM1 boards (and will likely deploy one more soon), and the J1900 board is sitting in its box unused.  If you still want the Q1900M, I'll take offers for mine.

Granted the hardware is end of life and has been for some time, i will happily keep purchasing it b/c its all so plentiful from ebay and third party e-cyclers. With that said, if youre looking for power savings then yes the Lxxxx is the way to go, however depending on if the VMs are windows with full GUIs vs linux you may want more RAM, but you can always over allocate RAM since the VM's will only use what they need, so even if you allocate 4Gb of ram to each VM, they may only use 1.5-2 once booted (and dependent on load). Now i wont tell you to invest in a newer socket...but for me, im not going ANYWHEREEE lol; by that i mean i will buy up all the 1366 socket stuff i need to keep my homelab running and then in 3-4 years when all the currently new stuff is being ripped out of datacenters, i will upgrade then; but if its cost effectiveness youre looking for a new less power hungry socket might be the way to go,"

Just depends how you see the future, but if the 4Gb DIMMs are that cost effective it might be worth getting them and moving to 48 eventually, and you can always mix a set of 4's with a set of 8's with the 8's being in the A-b-C slots, and the 4's in the E-F-G's"

Java is a pain when it comes to RAM and so I want to ensure I have a smooth experience.  I haven't really monitored usage so I cannot comment if less would be sufficient.  You don't need this operating 24x7 unless you are using the roam feature or guest web access.  So you could possibly get away with less.

homelab,3afvy8,Mooash,2,Sat Jun 20 08:18:21 2015 UTC,Yeah powerchute sucks.  I ditched it quickly.  I installed apsupsd and setup some bash scripts and cron jobs to take care of the shutdowns.  It does the job for me although I haven't had to invoke it.  My lab setup is minimal right now and I have a 46 minute battery power for my setup until I need to invoke a shutdown so for most outages in my area I haven't had to do a full shutdown.  I suspect that will decrease as I get more enterprise gear in my setup.  I am slowly building up right now so i have sufficient battery life.

homelab,3afvy8,bahwhateverr,3,Sat Jun 20 21:39:31 2015 UTC,"The disadvantages are small, since Ubuntu uses very little disk space to begin with, and also uses only a small amount of RAM.

homelab,3afvy8,Skallox,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:15:25 2015 UTC,My understanding is that VMs need another NAS type device to work effectively and you can't just pass through as sata connection.. Can you comment on that?
homelab,3afvy8,bahwhateverr,2,Sat Jun 20 23:02:29 2015 UTC,"I am not really understanding... A VM is just a Virtual Machine running on either a computer or server, using something like VirtualBox or VMware Workstation.

homelab,3afvy8,Skallox,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:55:08 2015 UTC,"I was mistaken in my last comment. Standard practice in every build I've ever done is to have a fast OS drive and economical storage drives. It's clear that you can have your VMs all on the fast drive but can you have your storage just be a typical ext4 formatted drive? I know you can do this on a large scale with commercial hardware by using VT-D and passing though an HBA.    Example: A virtual machine is to run flexget, transmission, and SMB. Can it use a storage drive connected via the same sata controller as the drive holding all the VMs? Can another VM on the same system running plex access the files locally or does it have to be through a network share?    Damnit, I need more hardware so I can just test this shit."

Better hardware utilization I'd have to disagree with.. between the overhead from your hypervisior and RAM allocation it makes sense to me that an Ubuntu installation that's doing 8 different things would use system resources much more effectively than 8 ubuntu VMs and a hypervisor.

That's right about performance! But these guys are notorious about changing their free version features all the time.

homelab,3ag80q,bahwhateverr,2,Sun Jun 21 19:39:05 2015 UTC,"iSCSI doesn't have to hurt performance. Here are some performance numbers from inside a VM running on ESXi backed by iSCSI. I'm very happy with it. Aside from synthetic benchmarks the real world ""feel"" of host operations (cloning, deploying from templates, etc) are very snappy. Some examples: Thick provisioning a 40GB disk is instant. Deploying a 40GB (17GB used) 2012 template takes about 10 seconds.   Now, full disclosure, a lot of the performance is due to the setup. 10Gbe, raid0 SSD LUNs, FreeBSD/ZFS iSCSI target (which supports all the VAAI primitives). Which brings me to my next point: If you are sensitive to performance you will probably never be happy with a Windows storage target. Believe me, I have tried it.   Since you're running four hosts which I assume are clustered it makes a lot more sense to have a SAN rather than local storage. I personally would just not use Windows for that SAN."

I keep ISOs on local storage for now and after configuring MPIO and using a new switch instead of my ASUS RT-N66U router I'm seeing pretty fast install times again, no more than 4-5 minutes to install Server 2012 ONTO network attached storage. I'm definitely happy with that considering I'm not using solid state storage anywhere.  I am still utilizing StarWind virtual SAN but my lab is still in an incomplete status right now, I just got a new rack and might be moving soon so I want to have the rack in place for where I plan to keep it before I start attempting things on FreeNAS instead of Server 2012 for SAN/NAS purposes."

I can't stress enough how valuable it is to get a report of a problem, look at a packet trace, and be able to ascertain when something looks weird. Even if you're not quite sure, you can go to a network guy or firewall guy and say ""hey, i'm looking at a packet trace and something looks off but I can't quite put my finger on it."" It shows competency, and by getting the trace and taking a stab at it you show you're not just trying to punt issues over the fence like most people typically do to the net/fw teams.   tl;dr : As a server guy who started in networking it kills me to see other sysadmins treat the network as a nebulous black box they have no interest in understanding.

One example is setting up a storage location on the host and using bind mount for container access.   As an example, I have my server running with two zpools and 9 containers (I prefer single usage containers) doing various things. All local container storage is bind mounted to /mnt/vz_storage, which is a bind of /storage on the PVE host. Bind mount was by far the best way for me to have them work together.

I just used Canonical's cloud installer to get a fully containerized lab running.

If you have an EXSi machine, you can't use the ESXi machine natively as an SQL Server, you would need a virtual machine in ESXI to act as the SQL server. Or am i missing something about your opening post?  I think that as long as you have a raid card that ESXi recognises then you set the raid up in bios, and ESXi will only see one ""hard disc"", onto which you will store your virtual machines (sql server, file server etc).  Depending on how many ports your RAID card has you could have two separate raid arrays ... one for the ESXi installation and one for all your virtual machines; but IMHO thats almost overkill as ESXi is only a small installation and would fit onto a USB stick or SDHC card. You;d be better off using all availabl raid ports for a raid onto which you save your virtual machines.  update the thread if i missed the point."

You then setup Replication between the two servers to a given folder on the 500GB drive.  At that point, the two servers will monitor the changes and replicate to the other server.  For a fail over scenario you will want to dig into DFS (Distributed File Systems).  You'll create an entry point.  Eg FileShare.Domain.com.  In which it will point to your two file shares.  Your clients then connect to FileShare.Domain.com, and they will go to one server or the other.  If you needed to perform maintaince on one, you pull it from active rotation and wait for the clients to fail over.  Disable replication (if needed), perform maintenance, enable replication (if disabled), re-enable the other file server.  At which points the clients won't know you did anything.  We have something like that setup where I work.  Its been a year or so since I last messed with it."

Replication is still occurring, but everyone is using Server A just like they do in present-day. In the event of an outage, I can get to Server B (and the other domain controller) that are at my other site and activate Server B for DFS.  Then clients should use Server B. Once the outage is over, I can flip back to A after hours when everyone is offline.

I've had my Synology for about the same length of time as the rest of my equipment but the amount I can do with it and the ease of use just means I don't think I could be without.  For running a minecraft server, you'd be better off running that on a separate machine. However, giving that you're just starting, you may find it preferable to run the minecraft server in a VM hosted on your desktop. That's an excellent way to start learning Linux (I assume you're going to use Linux) without spending any extra cash before you know what you need."

You are just starting though, better start simple and without spending money on something you may later regret.  Running a VM on your desktop is no more likely to leave it ""open for business to the world"" than what you're doing at the moment. A VM is locked down at the kernel level on the host OS. As far as any device (including your own PC) is concerned, it's an entirely separate computer. Whatever firewall/router you currently have would still service its purpose just as well."

The 2850 is garbage that someone else is trying to peddle on to you. Just look at the ad.... 9 days and no takers, even at $20. ""Any lower and I'll just donate them for a tax write-off, so please don't ask. Do your research on the model because at this price, I'm not answering questions."" - AKA: I just want these gone because Waste Management wants to charge me an e-waste fee to dispose of them. He probably can't even write them off on his taxes because they've depreciated them over the past 5-7yrs. They're worth less than $20 no matter which way you spin it. At least if it had storage it'd be worth looking into.  It's great that you're taking an interest in making a Homelab, but do yourself a favor now and take it slow. There's tons of people always trying to offload crap (like that 2850) onto anyone who can take it. Let it pass, do some reading/homework/thinking, and wait until something better comes along.   You can find PE2950's online with ease, but that's as low as I'd go to recommend to a new user. Too old, too hot, too loud, and a huge power drain. The price is usually right though, which is it's only saving grace (that and it's hardware level support for virtualization).  At this point I'd recommend /u/evemanufaturetool 's advice and running the VM on your desktop. Start with something simple like VirtualBox and use that to host the VM.

The only thing I see is a baked in DHCP server, which really isn't a killer feature.  While I'm glad to see more competition; Proxmox does everything your product does, and more for free with no limitations."
homelab,3aahk6,onenerdyguy,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:32:28 2015 UTC,"Actually we really like Proxmox! But have some great differences too. For example our free version gives almost all advantages of paid version, like free updates, free support via community forum, full access to enterprise repository.  VMmanager's auto installation makes everything run literally with only few clicks. You don’t need to setup IP’s, SSH keys separately (i.e. all settings are done automatically at install). Our product supports a bit more data storage methods like RBD.  Also with VMmanager you can always scale up a bit more cost effectively that with Proxmox."
homelab,3aahk6,onenerdyguy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:47:47 2015 UTC,"Wow.. there are some factually untrue things about your statement.  So I'll start with those:   Proxmox gives all features in their free version.  There isn't a single feature that is reserved for the paid version, except for support. Proxmox is built on straight Debian, which means Proxmox servers get their OS updates from Debian (for free); on top of that Proxmox provides a free enterprise repo for the non subscription users.  You do have them beat on the the community forum access Proxmox sets up IP address and SSH keys on install as well. THIS IS A HUGE ONE.  Proxmox supports way more storage models then your product does.  A. Proxmox supports Ceph, out of the box and through their web interface. Here is a screen shot of my ceph tab  B. Proxmox also supports GlusterFS, ZFS and ZFS over iSCSI. Screenshot here Your company's licensing is a bit simpler and potentially cheaper in the long run with the ability to pay €160/node one time for the standard KVM version.  The monthly plan of €8/node is on par with Proxmox's monthly support subscrpition of €4/cpu (assuming the average VM host has dual CPU's).  WHAT ISN'T BEING SAID; is on your company's software, if I wanted to have VMs fail over to another host due to an outage (aka High Availability) I would have to pay for the ""Cloud"" version (aka a premium license). In fact, the Cloud version is double the cost of five KVM subscriptions (and I had to go into your legal docs to see it the Cloud subscription is for 5 nodes).  This again, is a feature Proxmox provides for free.  More to the point, there is no feature lockout on the free version of Proxmox, the subscriptions are just for support.   So here is the crux if it all.  Proxmox beats your product on features + price.  When viewed through the lenses of a ""home labber"", the free version of your product is extremely restrictive.  If I wanted to just run two VMs on a host, I can stand Virtualbox up in a couple of minutes.  If I want more then two VMs, then your product is a no go, and I'll just run Proxmox which gives me no limitations. Looking at this from a small to medium size business, your company's product doesn't match up price+feature wise to the other KVM based competitors (esp, Proxmox).  If your company wants to be a player in the KVM (read alternative to VMWare) virtualization world, you have to match your competitors on features, and beat them either on price or ease of use (or invent a feature that makes my life as an admin easier and none of your competitors have).  P.S. Either you guys are ignorant to your competitors, or hoped we were ignorant, or you guys willfully attempted to spread disinformation/lies/F.U.D. about another competitor.  Don't come into our subreddit and do that again."
homelab,3aahk6,onenerdyguy,2,Fri Jun 19 07:00:53 2015 UTC,"First off, thank you for such a detailed response – this is precisely the kind of feedback we welcome from the community and came to Reddit for.  Now let’s go over some of the statements you have made:  1-2). Actually, support is not the only feature, as you claim:  “pve-no-subscription repo can be used for testing and non-production use. Its not recommended to run on production servers as these packages are not always heavily tested and validated.”  This is from Proxmox’s official WIKI. Proxmox VE Enterprise repositories are available only to all Subscription users.  Granted, of course, that the official WIKI is correct. Debian updates are free for Proxmox (which is built on Perl), sure, same as with VMmanager (C++). The updates are in the repository though, so, subscription based. With VMmanager there is one repository which is available to free and premium license holders.  3). Sorry, I was referring to network bridges and what I wanted to say was that VMmanager has installation wizards, which make the process more straightforward. It is subjective of course, but that was our intention. Guess it makes no difference to some :-)  4).  a) VMmanager supports ceph also, out of the box, and through web interface: WIKI1 + WIKI2. Proxmox does too – overlooked it at first. b) You are right about GlusterFS and ZFS. Proxmox takes the storages round, and I will be much more diligent with my statements in the future!  5). As you suggested, let’s assume that an average VM host has dual CPU’s. Proxmox will then cost 5 € * 2 * 12 = 120 € per year (I am rounding up 4.99 €, and calculating for the year as this is what you get a subscription for). VMmanager is 8 € per month (you don’t have to subscribe for a year, but 80 € per year. The difference is thus 40 € per year. A lot for some, irrelevant for others – just a different pricing model.  Since we have other licensing options, such as Lifetime license (one-off), then it is even cheaper in the longer run.  The Cloud version is indeed premium, includes 5 nodes, and is for high availability, has node diagnostic tools, and VM recovery. The price is 80 € per month (indeed double the cost of standard VMmanager per node). The information is clearly outlined in our order calculator as well as in the version comparison table. We are coming from the assumption that if you are building a failover cluster of at least 5 nodes, then it’s a host production environment and the solution should be premium (not free). Yes, Proxmox supports it in its basic form – it’s a matter of licensing policies.  So in terms of pricing, I would not agree that Proxmox beats VMmanager. If we look at pricing alone, then VMmanager is more competitive.  As for features of licensing, the most accurate statement would be to say that its different due to targeting and positioning: For example, Proxmox has failover cluster functionality built in for free, while VMmanager has it in a premium Cloud version. But at the same time, paid support for Proxmox is 200 € per incident, while 30 € for VMmanager. We are neither ignorant to our competitors nor to you. As I said before, I came to this subreddit to get feedback, especially for responses like yours. The aim was not to prove that VMmanager is better or worse than Proxmox (thus, lack of due diligence in some cases). We have our own development roadmap, we want our solution to evolve, and want to ask you, the users, what is lacking and what is great."

It was based on Redhat, but for people who didn't want to pay the support fees of Redhat. CentOS had so much community support that Redhat was actually getting some benefit from the CentOS community, so they eventually said 'Hey, you guys are actually pretty helpful. We want this community to exist so we're going to buy you up and make sure you guys can continue to exist.' Which they did. It's still the same community based OS, but it's just owned by Redhat now.  Redhat gets a lot from CentOS. They get the community, CentOS is essentially the QA of Redhat, which means a lot of stuff starts out in CentOS to makes sure it's stable before being put in Redhat."

However, you can't get a support contract for Debian like you can get for RHEL.  RedHat goes out of their way to make their product very corporate-friendly; you can go and buy a ""boxed"" versions of RHEL (not sure if it literally comes on physical media in a box anymore, but it used to) with a price commensurate with other Enterprisey software, and a support contract to match, and it's formally listed as a supported platform by other enterprise packages like Oracle, DB2, etc.  That last bit is probably the most important.  So if the idea is that you want to do stuff in a corporate environment, you are probably better off learning on CentOS because it is basically RHEL, and that's what the corporate world uses."

If the SSD was behind a RAID controller, it may simply be presented as a LUN and the OS not be SSD-aware and therefore not execute any TRIM commands.    Based on the presumed age of that system (IBM has docs indicating it was from 2007) and the controller itself I, personally, would not put an SSD in to that equation.  It seems like RAID controllers (in particular in server-class machines) have a specific set of compatible devices and I doubt that the new Samsung SSD would be on that HCL."

As an outsider looking in at their issue, I wonder if there is not some other factor playing a role that would appear to manifest itself as some sort of TRIM error.  (i.e. disk writes sitting in buffers and not getting flushed correctly so a write appeared to have occured on a block, but didn't (leaving the block zero'd) which someone might interpret as a botched TRIM command later.

homelab,3a5rbf,linuxcsgobro,41,Wed Jun 17 13:14:55 2015 UTC,"Succeeding in this field means reading. A lot. Like more than you ever have before. But I guarantee that you will not regret all those hours of studying when you remember something in the nick of time and save the day. My advice would be to not focus on specific technologies, but how they work. If you really want hands-on experience, here is a guide that I followed in preparation to be a Linux admin and it really does help a lot.   1) Set up a KVM hypervisor.  2) Inside of that KVM hypervisor, install a Spacewalk server. Use CentOS 6 as the distro for all work below. (For bonus points, set up errata importation on the CentOS channels, so you can properly see security update advisory information.)  3) Create a VM to provide named and dhcpd service to your entire environment. Set up the dhcp daemon to use the Spacewalk server as the pxeboot machine (thus allowing you to use Cobbler to do unattended OS installs). Make sure that every forward zone you create has a reverse zone associated with it. Use something like ""internal.virtnet"" (but not "".local"") as your internal DNS zone.  4) Use that Spacewalk server to automatically (without touching it) install a new pair of OS instances, with which you will then create a Master/Master pair of LDAP servers. Make sure they register with the Spacewalk server. Do not allow anonymous bind, do not use unencrypted LDAP.  5) Reconfigure all 3 servers to use LDAP authentication.  6) Create two new VMs, again unattendedly, which will then be Postgresql VMs. Use pgpool-II to set up master/master replication between them. Export the database from your Spacewalk server and import it into the new pgsql cluster. Reconfigure your Spacewalk instance to run off of that server.  7) Set up a Puppet Master. Plug it into the Spacewalk server for identifying the inventory it will need to work with. (Cheat and use ansible for deployment purposes, again plugging into the Spacewalk server.)  8) Deploy another VM. Install iscsitgt and nfs-kernel-server on it. Export a LUN and an NFS share.  9) Deploy another VM. Install bakula on it, using the postgresql cluster to store its database. Register each machine on it, storing to flatfile. Store the bakula VM's image on the iscsi LUN, and every other machine on the NFS share.  10) Deploy two more VMs. These will have httpd (Apache2) on them. Leave essentially default for now.  11) Deploy two more VMs. These will have tomcat on them. Use JBoss Cache to replicate the session caches between them. Use the httpd servers as the frontends for this. The application you will run is JBoss Wiki.  12) You guessed right, deploy another VM. This will do iptables-based NAT/round-robin loadbalancing between the two httpd servers.  13) Deploy another VM. On this VM, install postfix. Set it up to use a gmail account to allow you to have it send emails, and receive messages only from your internal network.  14) Deploy another VM. On this VM, set up a Nagios server. Have it use snmp to monitor the communication state of every relevant service involved above. This means doing a ""is the right port open"" check, and a ""I got the right kind of response"" check and ""We still have filesystem space free"" check.  15) Deploy another VM. On this VM, set up a syslog daemon to listen to every other server's input. Reconfigure each other server to send their logging output to various files on the syslog server. (For extra credit, set up logstash or kibana or greylog to parse those logs.)  16) Document every last step you did in getting to this point in your brand new Wiki.  17) Now go back and create Puppet Manifests to ensure that every last one of these machines is authenticating to the LDAP servers, registered to the Spacewalk server, and backed up by the bakula server.  18) Now go back, reference your documents, and set up a Puppet Razor profile that hooks into each of these things to allow you to recreate, from scratch, each individual server.  19) Destroy every secondary machine you've created and use the above profile to recreate them, joining them to the clusters as needed.  20) Bonus exercise: create three more VMs. A CentOS 5, 6, and 7 machine. On each of these machines, set them up to allow you to create custom RPMs and import them into the Spacewalk server instance. Ensure your Puppet configurations work for all three and produce like-for-like behaviors. Do these things and you will be fully exposed to every aspect of Linux Enterprise systems administration. Do them well and you will have the technical expertise required to seek ""Senior"" roles. If you go whole-hog crash-course full-time it with no other means of income, I would expect it would take between 3 and 6 months to go from ""I think I'm good with computers"" to achieving all of these"

homelab,3a5rbf,vinceskahan,5,Tue Jun 30 06:08:20 2015 UTC,"Interesting list. I did a whole lot of that kind of stuff in the last year.   Let me give you a slightly different list and order...this time suggest you use centos7 for more modern qemu-kvm support etc. and learn the DevOps deployment side of things.  1) set up a qemu-kvm hypervisor on centos7  2) build a VM manually, clone it, delete it from the commandline  3) learn kickstart well enough to do a hands-off build of a base vm in one command  4) define a configuration for the app of your choosing (apache2, whatever).   Deploy it to your minimal base vm with ansible using passwordless ssh keys  5) learn how to do (4) again, this time using vagrant/VirtualBox and an ansible provisioner  6) learn how to do (4) again this time in docker.  Note: docker doesn't play well with firewalld in centos7.  Learn how to disable firewalld and use iptables in your host os.  7) capture everything in git.  Learn git.  Really.  8) agree with previous posts - set up a central VM syslog server.  Configure all your VMs to log there.  Bonus points if you use a DevOps tool to make that configuration change (hint - ansible).  Store your modified playbooks in git.  9) nuke any/all of your client VMs, rebuild it.   Base box then a configured one.  Use the DevOps tool(s) you learned.  10) agree with previous posts - set up central monitoring of up/down/health using any tool.  Nagios.  Zabbix.  Icinga.  Whatever you want.  11) learn iptables.  Really.  Block access to stuff.  Permit access to stuff.  Learn how to probe/test with nmap  Bottom line - learning 'stuff' when the field is so broad is not likely to succeed too well, you need to find a problem that means something to you and apply the technologies you're learning to a problem that matters to you.    Once you've learned how to spin up a configuration, capture it in a version control system, and monitor it, you can make the infrastructure a non-event and concentrate on building something fun.  Example - I have a wifi webcam monitoring my door.  I run a qemu-kvm VM to do the monitoring.   I can one-command build that whole box to a base image, boot it, and configure it.    There's a whole lot of stuff in being able to do that that directly applies to working in the field.  DNS.  Ansible.  Kickstart.  qemu-kvm.  Iptables. Syslogging.  Monitoring.  But if you can find a real problem you're interested in, it'll make it easier to figure out which technologies get you there best/fastest to help you focus on some areas on the infrastructure side..."

I felt dread anytime I saw iptables mentioned in tutorials or I needed to do anything with it. I took 2 weeks and tried to learn as much about iptables as I could. I built routers from fresh Linux installs, made a transparent proxy, practiced securing local boxes and remote servers. After some time, it clicked, felt like I could see the code in the matrix and iptables made some sense.   It was at this point I realized that tutorials and how-to guides online are mostly lacking real understanding and explanation of topics.

homelab,3a88wz,chuckbales,3,Thu Jun 18 02:42:11 2015 UTC,"Only MX records are designed to work this way. A records are not designed to work in this failover scenario, the reason being that if you have multiple A records, all of them are sent to clients at once. Then its up to the client to decide which one to use. If it happens to use the one for the link thats currently up, great. If it uses the record for the primary when the primary is down, it can timeout or introduce delay as it waits before trying other records.  That being said, there are DNS hosts that offer this service by monitoring your links. They use low TTL values on the records, so when they see your primary connection is down, they actually change the value of the records to reflect the backup IPs. The low TTL values mean other DNS servers won't cache the records for too long, preventing them from handing out 'stale' records."

This then lets them advertise out the same block of IPs to multiple ISPs, and since they're using the same IPs on both circuits they can keep their DNS records consistent.  Using the DNS monitoring method works but can be hokey, I've seen implementations where the DNS providers monitoring had failed, causing the records to stay in place even though they should have failed over."

I guess you've got pretty similar functionality in OneNote. Basically track everything you do there - take screenshots of GUI config files, copy/paste command line stuff, add notes as to what you are trying to do.  By logging everything, you don't have to remember what it was you did. It's all captured.  Once I've actually finished messing around and have something working, go back through the notes and create the Wiki page to document the finished product ( logs of hostnames etc. ) and the shiny process you might have invented. This is likely to be neater, more organised and reusable than the Evernote/Onenote log, but you don't want to worry too much about formatting and structure of documents at the same time as trying to understand why the doowop isn't installing."

As to the why do you want a dedicated box, it is easier to troubleshoot firewall problems (this is how all your internet traffic will travel.) when it is its own piece and not connected to your exsi host or other hardware.  EXSI - This is a virtualization platform. You create this so you can create most of your lab here. You have one server, which is the EXSI host, that holds all the Virtual Clients you want/need. Not only does this give you a huge amount of flexibility, (You don't have to have a computer for every client you want) this provides saving the the way of power, heat, and space. Also it allows for more control of the machines attached to the host. Say that you need to load a windows 7 32 bit computer to test a group of programs well through the scripting and templates available through the exsi host you can automagically spin up as many as you need without having to personally load the computer yourself, now you need windows 7 64 bit....

homelab,3a7l8s,CamoAnimal,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:50:21 2015 UTC,"Sorry about that. Google is the registrar for all my domains. I pointed the name servers for example.com to ns1 and ns2.box.example.com like the mailinabox guide requires.

However, the dns panel inside the mailinabox is annoying and I was wondering if I can keep the mx records on the mailinabox and somehow use googles dns panel for other records I need to add for example.com. Essentially is it possible for dns records to be read inside both panels by setting nameservers to ns1.box.example.com and ns1.google.com?

homelab,3a7l8s,just_insane,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:18:22 2015 UTC,You could probably host it at home if you can ensure the server stays up and port 25 isn't blocked. I got the 10$/month vps from digital ocean and put it there. I don't have a ups at home yet so it'd be more reliable there.
homelab,3a693q,_Hnnng_,4,Wed Jun 17 15:38:37 2015 UTC,"More specifically, what amount of hardware I should start out with?   That's not a good question to start with. A single Dell R710 will run circles around half dozen PE2950s. Quantity is less important than function, and in this case, you're looking for function over fashion. It's nice to have a bunch of servers in a rack, but if you don't NEED it all, you're just running up the energy bills.   Like, x amount of vm's running x software.   Again, totally up to you. Are you building a domain? I'd suggest a VM running Server 2012 (Vanilla or R2, your call) with 4-6GB memory and a 50GB storage drive. Are you going to DHCP through the DC as well? If not, that's another VM, but pfSense can do DHCP pretty easy and is lightweight. If you're doing it on Windows, I'd suggest another VM. Keep DHCP and DC's separate as a best-practice.  Speaking of VMs, what hypervisor do you want to use? VMware ESXi, Microsoft HyperV, VirtualBox, Proxmox, Xen, etc. Lots of choices out there, all with their various pros and cons.   just wanted to learn and could use some recommendations   In that case, don't spend a lot of money. Don't go buy a brand new server or network gear. From the sounds of it, most people here get their gear from dumpster diving, ebay/Amazon deals, or company e-waste/liquidations. Find a decent server chassis with CPUs and buy/upgrade the memory/drives to your needs.  If you let us know what kind of gear you have, we can run some numbers and tell you about how much it'll cost on your energy bill. That's something a lot of people here constantly overlook. Yes, having a stack of PE2950s and PE1950s is cool, until you realize you're spending +$100 a month on power, and another chunk of change on the cooling for it too."

No idea what connectors they use, SAS or SATA, but that should give you a general idea what to look for.    http://www.ebay.com/itm/Xiotech-Magnitude-3D-3000-SAN-Server-FC-800517-000-controller-Fiber-channel-/201353699531?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item2ee19da0cb  There are other options also, like picking up another cheap server with plenty of bays, install linux and put Fibre-channel's equivalent of iSCSI initiator on it and offer it out as a storage location for other servers.  I haven't read it, but here's an article that claims instructions on how to build a Fibre-channel SAN for less than $1k. http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/nas/nas-howto/31485-build-your-own-fibre-channel-san-for-less-than-1000-part-1"

I was thinking about buying a Sans Digital storage tower, connecting it to a RAID controller on a machine and serving that up over the network, is this a bad idea?  Here's a tower I was looking at. Not sure if the bundled controller is any good though  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16816111181"
homelab,3a65et,omegatotal,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:52:09 2015 UTC,I would not touch that thing unless they made a version that breaks out each drive trays sata/sas port(s) so that I could use my own cables instead of its built in controller.
homelab,3a65et,douchecanoo,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:03:14 2015 UTC,At that point aren't you just building your own storage PC basically. I mean plenty of people love Drobo and other similar NAS boxes but there's no hardware control there either
homelab,3a65et,omegatotal,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:29:11 2015 UTC,I would break out the cables and use one of the sas expanders in place of that fakeraid hardware. still only one cable to the HBA but better performance and true JBOD support w/o sacrificing SMART support which is common on these types of fakeraid hardware
homelab,3a65et,libertysyclone,0,Fri Jun 19 16:46:09 2015 UTC,"I would suggest building one at that point. All of the older shelves that use FC (read NetApp) are still going to use FC drives and suck down power.   If you already have FC hardware/switch, then I would just say run ZFS (openindiana or similar) [FreeNas doesnt support FC targets] and go that route.   If you dont have FC hardware, the I would just stick to iSCSI"

Home 240v is a different setup entirely, even if it's within the range of ""voltage"". 240V in the home is done with 2 legs within the same ""time"" phase. Some people call it double phase or two phase power, but that's incorrect.  Three phase has 3 different ""times"" of 277V power. This is then ""stepped down"" to 208V  because you use the potential between two phases."
homelab,3a3dsf,Brak710,3,Tue Jun 16 23:45:35 2015 UTC,240V 2-phase. The way I jerry-rigged it in my old appartment measured out to be 220V. Well within 10%.
homelab,3a3dsf,Eman0123,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:29:53 2015 UTC,"Are you sure that worked? There isn't really a two phase power, you fed it two legs of 120V to get 240V potential.  I'm 95% sure this expects 208V three phase leg-to-leg."

homelab,3a3dsf,Brak710,2,Wed Jun 17 03:10:17 2015 UTC,So you had to hunt down two outlets that had the hot side on opposite taps of the transformer? Your outlet contraption just seems to have short power cables for how far apart the legs usually are in a house.  Then you fed the +120V and -120V into the left and right prongs on the outlet?  I'm insanely curious that this works. I work on datacenters for a living. Do endless 480V/3P and 208V PDUs... Making 240V house power work like 208V 3P didn't seem logical to me until you made me question everything I've known.  Are you sure these PSUs are actually seeing 240V?
homelab,3a3dsf,VexingRaven,3,Wed Jun 17 07:23:13 2015 UTC,"We used this in a small dorm room, happened to be that each side of the room we were using had a different phase on each side.  Then yes, right prong, left prong... 120 - (-120) = 240.  More Detail Here  At my work's power electronics lab we have a big transformer box that takes 208V Y 3-phase into 240V 2-Phase."

homelab,3a3dsf,derfherdez,2,Wed Jun 17 05:12:01 2015 UTC,"Both supplies were in a 120 socket, would start, get to EFI, begin booting, then turn off.  It only succeeded when they were plugged into that combiner outlet."
homelab,3a3dsf,baleia_azul,2,Wed Jun 17 05:15:28 2015 UTC,That's what two-phase is.
homelab,3a3dsf,red_tux,0,Wed Jun 17 19:31:49 2015 UTC,"It's not. There is no two-phase anymore. -120V and +120V are two legs within the same phase. Three phase as three separate ""time-signals"" of power.  I guess the knowledge to gain here is that 240V from -120V/+120V potential will be fine for 208V power supplies."
homelab,3a3dsf,trevyz,2,Wed Jun 17 19:45:02 2015 UTC,"It's called split phase and it functions on the same principles as three-phase. That said, the power supply doesn't care how it gets the voltage potential as long as it gets it."
homelab,3a3dsf,linuxlearningnewbie,3,Wed Jun 17 19:55:07 2015 UTC,I had this marine step up where you plugged in two (separate!) 110's and it gave you the 220v.  I ran some 'massive' 8 CPU PentiumPro HP monster for over a year like that.

Captive portals are one of those things that have gotten popular beyond all reason.  They're a crappy solution 90% of the time, and you probably don't need that TOS agreement anyway.  (Unless you have an actual lawyer telling you that you need it, and has written the TOS, you're just cargo culting.  Chances are the thing you'll copy-and-paste together won't even be enforceable.)  If what you want to accomplish is a time limit, you can do the same thing with a traditional WiFi hotspot and a WPA-PSK key that changes periodically (e.g. every night).  You can also do things like let people connect by default without the stupid captive portal (which is a PITA on tablets and mobile), but then force them into the portal only when their time expires.  And a time limit is a pretty inelegant way of managing network utilization; there are lots of better traffic shaping methods depending on what you are actually trying to achieve.  Think hard about whether it's really the right solution.  Just because ""everybody else does it!"" doesn't mean it's a great idea."

homelab,3a44ot,Spazbototto,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:07:29 2015 UTC,"No one ""needs"" a dedicated lab-- you could just as easily chip in a bit more to max out your computer to 32GB of RAM and successfully study for the MCSA without the additional hardware. Will it be blazing fast? No. Will you be able to spin up a ton of VMs all at once? Probably not (especially on 16GB of RAM). But it will get the job done.  A homelab is nice, but think hard about your use case and your budget before you start looking into investing cash into hardware.  That said, I greatly enjoy the benefits of having a small, dedicated lab from which to work. I allows me complete separation of my lab environment from the rest of my computer (leaving my personal computer free to open up whatever applications I need) and it means not having to shut my lab down immediately after I'm done with it. I can just leave the dedicated hardware on and return when I'm ready."

A single rotating disk can't do enough to make using multiple Windows VMs anything but painful. You'll hit a wall with that long before you hit a wall with CPU or memory. I'd say get an SSD at least for your main OS, install Windows 8 to make use of Hyper-V, and just make sure to use dynamic memory on your VMs. You should be able to run 4 VMs easily, probably closer to 5-6 as long as you keep background applications to a minimum and are just running Windows services."

Get some hardware together and start firing up servers/random OS's you can get your hands on. Homelabs are for learning how to slap random shit together with what you can find and make it work unless you are rich enough to just buy exactly what you need when you need it. There are a fuckton of guides and lists of what hardware to get, so you kinda just have to do your own research. Just start reading threads here in /r/homelab to get a feel for what people use then base your needs off that."

homelab,3a4pr5,Gotxi,1 point,Wed Jun 17 10:26:07 2015 UTC,"You can build your esxi+vcenter lab environment all inside a virtual infraestructure for learning.  What you can do: Use a powerful computer, mostly it should have a lot of ram. You can do minimal tests with 8 gb, but 16 or more would be more suitable for the lab. It can be your own home computer (i do my personal tests in it).  Use 2 pendrives, one to burn the esxi iso as bootable (i use rufus, it does the job great https://rufus.akeo.ie/) and other to actually install esxi in, you will use it as a boot hard drive when you want to do tests in your computer without using a dedicated hard drive. If you want to be sure that you don't erase any real hard drive, unplug all of them of your computer so you can only install esxi in the pendrive.  Once esxi is installed, you can boot it whenever you want with usb booting, or just your regular desktop OS. Inside esxi, you can then install the esxi's you need and vcenter appliance inside one of them and start playing. You will need a hard drive or storage to actually storage the vmdk's (vmware hard drive files) so i would recommend having a dedicated hard drive (works fine with a 500gb USB drive in my case) and use thin provisioning hard drives so you won't eat unused space.  About licensing, you can use the 60 day evaluation license, and with esxi, you can reset the 60 day timer deleting the license files and restarting the service, search in google how to do that. With vcenter is more complex, you have to export your database, reinstall vcenter and import your database again every 60 days."

For example, right now im doing ZFS testing trying to combine different kind of raids, and testing how self-healing, deduplication and compression work in a transparent way to an OS.  Another thing i will do when done with ZFS, is to install hyper-v, esxi, xenserver, XCP (in separate vm's) and on top of them, openstack. So i will try to make VM's on demand, VDI's, how each hypervisor perform, etcetera.  When done, i will try proxmox, virtuozzo and ovirt too, i like virtualization and there is a lot to test :)  If you like pure vmware, basically you will want to try every feature the license has. Vmotion, DRS, HA, Vapp's, resoure pools, templates, migrations... It's simple. Install esxi evaluation, check the licensed features and start testing them one by one as a check-list. You can also search for books and do the labs they propose to see if you know everything you need or there is something missing in your tests.  If you are still hungry of vmware, you can start testing horizon + view, and provide virtualized apps and desktops on demand to local and remote users.  Any other topic that you are interested in?"

It's configured so that data is spread between all 3 hosts as a single shared piece of storage. It does provide redundancy that if a single host fails it will still function. It has the advantage of not needing dedicated SAN hardware, however the licensing is pretty steep (almost $3k I believe) so for me personally it doesn't make sense but I'm sure there's certain deployments where it does."

Then you can share the drive space with network services like NFS, CIFS, iSCSI, etc. Do you want to mount the array in other VMs so they can read and write to it? You could just set up a persistent mount point that mounts over the network. I know absolutely nothing about how to configure that, other than probably using /etc/mtab or fstab. I always forget which one it is. We have some servers at work that have persistent LUN mounts from our SAN using /dev/mapper.  You said you want to attach the storage to two hosts, do you mean guests? Like VMs? You would have to create differently-sized datastores for each guest, I think.

If so what you'll need is a link load balancer/link balancer (in other words, a load balancer that does outbound traffic balancing). This can also sometimes be referred to as ""bonding"" by certain manufacturers.  PFSense can do ""Gateway Groups"" which will require firewall rules to configure traffic to go to specific gateways based on those rules, but it is not a true WAN Aggregation, however the ""Price is Right"" as it were, as an Elfiq LB800E (400Mbps total throughput) runs around $2900 depending on the distributor.  For what it's worth, there's certainly other firewall options that can do the PFSense ""Gateway Groups"" and do more than just link redundancy, however many of them will again require the purchase of additional features. Perhaps one of the other software firewall solutions offers true link balancing (or at least something closer to it), but I'm not familiar enough with any of them except for PFSense to know about it."

Edit: I looked at your Asus router manual, I see dual band (using both wireless bands) but nothing on Dual wan.  Does your ISP router have dual WAN?  If so they should be able to set that up for you."

homelab,3a3w86,aerofly0610,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:56:06 2015 UTC,"I understand what dual wan is for, I don't understand why you don't want them on the same VLAN or on a dual WAN if you are trying to aggregate without some crazy routing schema?  I read the manual for the product you linked, it has no mention of dual wan.  It has one wan port and 4 lan port, with no mention in the manual to convert a LAN to WAN.  The switch you mention, I cant find any specs that it does level 3 routing, so I am not sure how you're even utilizing both WANs.  I am just trying to understand what you have and what you are trying to do, because something is missing.  If you want to DYI, use sophos or pfsense with two WAN nics and 1-2 LAN nics.  Otherwise you can use an off the shelf like a Cisco or ZyXel (will cost more).  You'd then put both router/modems into bridge mode so you arent double NATing (performance issues here)."
homelab,3a3w86,devianteng,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:05:00 2015 UTC,"I was actually just pasting that text from the manual of the RTAC68U, no trying to teach you:) I might have been a little unclear as of my intentions but i want to do the DIY way with pfsense with dual WAN nics and bridged mode. (the problem is the supplier is providing a shit router that you dont have any access to exept their own buildt in via their homepage. Meaning EVEN if i set both they routers/mediaconverters in bridge mode they will still set some random QoS rules that gives me throttling and performance issues. The way to counter this was to remove their router, connect the mediaconverter directly into a VLANrouter (set the vlan tag on the port) and i could use the wan interface on the asus as specified. BUT if I try to do that on the 2nd connection, i cannot set VLAN101 on the LAN interface to convert to WAN (i'm using a distinct firmware version supplied by merlin (https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin)  Was that any clearer? thanks for taking the time to comment."
homelab,3a3w86,aerofly0610,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:27:39 2015 UTC,"Ah custom firmware, that changes things.  Are you in the USA?  FYI ISP QoS is now ""illegal"" in the USA and you can file a complaint with the FCC for net neutrality violation.  I believe EU has something similar, but not sure.  I used to work for an ISP, mentioning FCC complaints got attention (squeaky wheel gets the oil).    If it where me, Id get both modems into bridge mode then send them to a sophos box (you can use pfsense) on dual nic card A.  Then send it to my switch on dual nic card B with VLAN 1 and VLAN 2.  VLAN 1 would be my ""prod"" network meaning family internet.  VLAN 2 would be my ""lab"" network meaning my NAS and ESX host.  I will be doing this actually, once I have some funds to buy my sophos box.  My Wan 2 will be a USB Cellular connection for failover only.  You could use load balancing between the 2 wans to have double the capacity but not double the speed.  That is you can't send a packet at 200Mbps but 2 packets at 100Mbps.  If you want to get real crazy, get a 2nd switch and have side A and side B (like we do in datacenters).  Have failover/load balanced NICs in everything."

homelab,3a0erf,pylori,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:35:22 2015 UTC,"I've done something similar to this with a raspberry pi, I don't remember exactly how I did it, but took a lot of messing around with iptables. It boiled down to forwarding everything incoming from the LAN on the Pi (locally) to vpn tunnel. And then incoming connections would have to be made through the VPN's outside IP address. I had a script that checked the IP address of the VPN every so often to make sure that the outbound traffic was forwarded to the appropriate place.  I'm not sure how different it would be doing it through your router, and I don't have access to my Pi at the moment to take a look at the iptables I have set up. I think it depends on your VPN provider and the way they set up the connection. I know some give you direct outside IPs whereas some give you a local 10.x or 192.168.x.x address which makes it much harder to deal with the forwarding traffic appropriately and get inbound connections."
homelab,39wlkl,hooah212002,11,Mon Jun 15 11:49:43 2015 UTC,I would say hard lesson learned is to do the MS best practices and have at least one hardware-based DC...
homelab,39wlkl,itguy1991,2,Mon Jun 15 12:02:13 2015 UTC,"Maybe, sure. But I can't reboot my whole environment when I need to reboot my DC if restarting the services doesn't work. ideally, I'd do everything in best practice, but unless you're offering to buy me more gear, I have to make do with what I have."
homelab,39wlkl,itguy1991,6,Mon Jun 15 12:05:43 2015 UTC,"Hell, instead of a hardware DC, set up a basic DC as a VirtualBox machine on your desktop/laptop that you only spin up when you need to reboot your main VM host (making sure that the two DCs sync before doing said reboot).  Edit: Point being, make sure you have a DC outside of your main VM host if your VMs and host use directory credentials. The answer to this mess up is not more backups."
homelab,39wlkl,itguy1991,5,Mon Jun 15 12:38:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is the lesson I learned. I realize this now.   But this is PRECISELY why I am doing any kind of lab shit at all: so I can learn by fucking at home instead of at work.  I never meant that more backups would be an answer, just to make sure you have backups that work. I worded it wrong."
homelab,39wlkl,multivacac,2,Mon Jun 15 12:52:48 2015 UTC,"Fair enough on the wrong wording. Sorry if I came off as being rude, it was not my intention.

homelab,39wlkl,ach_sysadmin,3,Mon Jun 15 12:59:39 2015 UTC,"I did that, but I could not thoroughly test whether or not it worked. You see, I just installed pfsense this last week and turned that same router into an AP, so I had to reset it back into a router in like 15 minutes. I could not thoroughly check to make sure it had proper routing functionality back, especially since I had been forwarding ALL DNS requests to my DNS server. Apparently it did, though, because they were able to watch Netflix and never complained that the net was down."

homelab,39wlkl,Y0tsuya,2,Mon Jun 15 15:30:16 2015 UTC,Pretty good idea. I have 2 DCs in my home lab. I can move them around if I want to shut my host off for some reason. I have a second host I can move 1 or both too.
homelab,39wlkl,onenerdyguy,3,Mon Jun 15 12:44:23 2015 UTC,"I have to admit, I learned this lesson the easy way. Went to Interop in Las Vegas a few years ago and got chatting with a developer from a large hardware company that did the same thing on his dev network, but didn't have backups. He said he spent something like 6 hours manually recreating the domain.  So, OP, even the pros can make this mistake."
homelab,39wlkl,itguy1991,2,Mon Jun 15 12:48:26 2015 UTC,I realized early on that having my sole DC on VM created a chicken-and-egg problem.  I just followed MS recommendation and used a cheap low-powered nettop as secondary DC.

homelab,39wlkl,Defiant001,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:49:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly, not sure anymore, but the point was to have a DC outside of a DC-controlled virtual environment, whether that be virtual or physical is up to you."
homelab,39wlkl,scotchlover,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:01:57 2015 UTC,"I think the idea is that you can physically isolate the machine if it is physical and therefor ensure that only people with physical access that you've already vetted can get to the console. If virtualized, all that needs to happen is for any one of your client machines on the same host to become compromised and, even though a miniscule chance, all other clients on that host are at risk."
homelab,39wlkl,scotchlover,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:04:22 2015 UTC,It's no longer a literal beat practice. You should just have two DCs available in a configuration that if one goes down the other doesn't.

What software will you use? RAID1 with spinning disks may not be able to support the IOPS that you need for many Vms. An SSD for your VM datastore should relieve any issues, unless you are really hammering the IOPS."
homelab,39yyd1,PsycoCarrot,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:40:00 2015 UTC,"I think I'm going to try doing the raid10,f2 with all 3 of the disks. I am also going to buy a 6tbb spinner for backups after I get paid. For now, backup wise, I'll rsync to my desktop over samba.   All the VMs will be going on the array. My ssd is way too small for anything more than just the host. I'm hoping that the array will be fast enough. I was reading into raid10,f2 and it seems that with 2 disks it gets the write speed of raid 1 and the read speed of raid 0. I'm optimistic that doing this with 3 disks will be more than fast enough for about 3-5 VMs.   I think (hope) this will end up being fast enough and have enough redundancy in case anything less than preferable happens."
homelab,39yyd1,PsycoCarrot,2,Tue Jun 16 14:08:13 2015 UTC,"Ok, RAID10f2 will work for that setup. It's an interesting setup, which partially bridges the gap of RAID1 and RAID10; you have striped data which gives you combined disk throughput like R10, but you only have single fault tolerance like R1.   If you can, I might suggest getting two 6TB drives, so you can rotate them out and keep one off-site. That way, if your house burns down or your home is robbed and the NAS is stolen, your offsite backup will be sitting pretty. I have a similar NAS/VM host setup, and I keep all the stuff that is critical (important docs, family pictures, etc) in a special folder that I have scripted to run a nightly rsync onto an external backup HDD. Once a week, I bring it to work and swap it for the one I keep in my desk drawer. I don't bother to keep offsite backups of my movies or Linux iso's or game installs because all of that shit can be obtained again fairly easily. If you do this method, it is probably worthwhile to encrypt your externals to ensure they aren't tampered with.  Something to ponder."

homelab,39y0od,onenerdyguy,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:47:28 2015 UTC,"You are adding heat to an outdoor space that is likely poorly sealed.  Because you're adding heat, you won't need to worry much about humidity - raising the outside air temperature even a few degrees will keep moisture from condensing. It could be a problem if you leave things powered off for any length of time though.  You may need to worry about overheating in the summer. The general temperature spec for server hardware is a maximum of 95F/35C at the air inlet. Fans will likely spin up faster before that temperature is reached, which means more power draw and more noise. There's only a few ways for heat to get out of a server room with no AC - air exchange and radiation, basically. The more of that you have, the lower the temperature difference between ambient and inside at equilibrium.  Any time you make a place warmer/drier than the outside, you're making an inviting home for bugs and rodents. This would be my main concern - make sure that everything is sealed or screened off."

I'm not running the haproxy on the VPS so the VPS doesn't have my keys. They have the OpenVPN keys of course, but the only thing running inside the tunnel is TLS traffic anyway...  Latency to the VPS is ~30ms, and latency from it to my lab is ~30ms, so total is ~60ms. Fine for my purposes, but maybe not good for game servers.  Been working this way for close to 2 years I think.

homelab,39xhex,phishpin,3,Tue Jun 16 00:43:55 2015 UTC,You could probably easily do this with pfSense and some simple firewall rules and use OpenVPN client in pfSense to connect to the VPS or do it the other way around and host the VPN server on pfSense and put the client on the VPS.  If you do it the first way as I described I know for a fact you can tell pfsense to force your traffic for specific hosts through the VPN. It's as simple as creating a FW rule and defining the gateway as the VPN interface.   This way you can just have certain servers going through the VPN connecting to you VPS with internal networking and then having a reverse proxy on the VPS for your sites.

homelab,39x1nx,Mr_That_Guy,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:14:31 2015 UTC,Correct.  The Sabretooth FX990 and the M5A78L-M/USB are both confirmed to be working with ECC.  They do state ECC support in the specs if you look carefully.
homelab,39x1nx,PsycoCarrot,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:41:14 2015 UTC,"AM3+ CPUs are decently powerful depending on what you are doing, but they do use quite a bit more electricity than an intel CPU of the same overall power.   AFAIK getting new intel hardware thats VT-d capable is going to be more expensive unless you can pick up an old 1366 board with support, but at that point the power usage will be similar to a newer AMD build. If power usage isnt a problem than either an old 1366 board with a cheap 6 core xeon from ebay would be a fine choice depending on your needs."
homelab,39x1nx,localtoast,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:33:30 2015 UTC,I checked out the watt usage stats and the difference was less than 30$ /yr with 5hrs of 100% load a day.  Seeing's this is going to long term temporarily (3-5 months) replace two DL380 G5's that had 2x E5440 each and were pulling avg 200W /each during idle...  I moved most of the VM's to a Sun Fire X2270 M2 with 2x E5620's but still have a gap as that is just a 1U.  The savings on power will pay for this box over the 4 months...
homelab,39x1nx,UniversalSuperBox,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:18:23 2015 UTC,"I got myself a good FX-6300 and mobo combo from Microcenter. I still haven't managed to get close to maxing out the 6300. That may be because I normally only run Linux VMs handling some light-duty stuff (dns, dhcp, samba), but I would say you will run out of RAM before you run out of compute with a 6300. Almost all AMDs will also come with Vt-x/d and support ECC as well. However, I don't think the 6300 supports AES natively, so if you are doing lots of encryption, there will be an additional CPU overhead.  I found Intel's offerings to be a bit too expensive for me during my build. Less of Intel's chips offer Vt-x/d, but alot of them do offer AES instructions. Generally, Intel will have better single-threaded performance and IPC, so one CPU core might handle more VMs than a single AMD core. This somewhat balances out the ""less cores"" thing of Intel.  If you have any questions I'd be happy to help."

You also might want to try dropping those forwarders and see if root hints work correctly on their own.  There is a bug with 2012 dns depending on setup that can cause it to not forward routing correctly with certain configurations.

homelab,39wq5g,Narolad,2,Mon Jun 15 13:56:41 2015 UTC,"Using an internal and an external DNS is a terrible idea if you have anything going on in the internal DNS.

It's far better to correctly configure local DNS for forwarders, which he appears to have done, and DNS does not appear to be the biggest or first issue he's having here.  OP: Please provide us the ipconfig /all of both PCs. ipconfig /all should have a DHCP server entry, and if we can confirm that both working and non-working clients are getting information from the same DHCP server we can look over DHCP config to determine why you have clients getting no Option 003 from your DHCP server... but first we need to make sure that the non-working clients are not somehow ""clinging"" to a lease from the old DHCP server that's been disabled."

homelab,39uw3n,itguy1991,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:20:29 2015 UTC,"I have a workstation that doesn't support any sort of remote management, and I deal with it in the following way:   It has a serial port; I have this connected to a Raspberry Pi's UART.  The Pi runs (and logs the output of) a screen session, and runs an ssh daemon so that I can connect remotely.  If you set up the bootloader, kernel, and OS correctly, this gives you out-of-band command-line access to everything except the BIOS.  (You could add a USB-based serial device to your NUC.) I happen to have a PDU nearby, so I can remotely power cycle the machine when/if I need to.  If you don't already have one (and aren't excited about having an excuse to buy one) I bet you can do the same with some cheap home automation parts.   For waking the device, I agree with everyone else saying that you should look at Wake-on-LAN.  If you want a fancy-pants solution and don't mind this turning into sort of a project, I've done some things involving microcontrollers that might fit the bill.  Find a microcontroller capable of both USB and Ethernet; have it pretend to be whatever sort of USB device you like (a hub in front of a keyboard and a mouse, for example) and write some software to let you control those virtual devices over the network connection.  This is how out-of-band management in modern server hardware works, by the way.  You use IPMI to interact with the BMC (""baseband management controller""), which is an ARM SoC sitting on the motherboard.  A few of the host's USB ports are hardwired to this SoC (via traces on the motherboard), and it uses those to present a virtual USB mouse and virtual USB keyboard to the host.  The part that will be tricky to do yourself is the remote video, if you need that.  A BMC like the one I described above will have a hardware video encoder; it presents a fake ""video card"" to the host, encodes the output, and streams it to you over the network.  If you really need remote video, though, maybe it's enough to be able to wake the machine remotely so that you can connect via VNC/RDP/etc.?  (Obviously that doesn't help you in situations where the host's networking is messed up, but...)"

You can have a same physical interface with 2 ip's, one for inside lan and other for outside to router, all in the same switch. Computers aim at the inside lan ip, and pi routes through the other ip to the router, and meanwhile filters whatever you need to do.  It can be bypassed with direct ip's to the router, but if you just want to filter for security at home it is perfectly valid."

I've delt with a number of equipment moves at various jobs and moving things on a truck with wheels still attached is generally a bad idea. We usually removed wheels to prevent issues or made sure 2x4's were supporting the frame of the structure and the wheels were off the ground. I've seen this exact issue several times, the moving truck hits a large bump and the rack bounces and one or more wheels collapse, the drop of the collapsing wheel then further destroys things. One thing to remember is casters are generally rated for a static load, that caster rated for 500 lbs can quickly fail under a vertically moving dynamic load. Sadly most moving companies don't know this.  Hopefully they're making this right and paying you for the damage."

My stuff was also insured by the estimated weight, but it's the total weight of everything shipped that determines your maximum allowable claim. So the weight of this one rack is only relevant if it was the only item moved (the poster seemed to imply they moved their whole residence). Additionally, you are not out of luck the moment the truck pulls away as you are not expected to unpack and inspect a ton of goods in the time it takes to unload them. That takes weeks."

The only input I have is that it could be possible to use a single NIC motherboard that may be easier to find and cheaper if you have under 80 or so megabit internet speed and are willing to use a USB NIC for your red interface.  I always used mobos with 2 NICs built in for my router until I was looking to save power and noise by going with a Raspberry Pi and then a Banana Pi for better performance over the Raspberry.  With these, I had to use a USB NIC and came to realize that they work great as long as they are used for Red and not your bottleneck due to being slower USB speeds.  USB NICs work great for my chosen home firewall: IPFire. I can't speak for pfsense, but assume that you would have the same excellent result."

I ask because most KVMs are 2-, 4-, 8-port (and so on).

I'd think that if you can assign two nics to a vm in XenServer (one on your 192. and another on 10.) then you should be able to pick up from step #2 on the link I gave earlier to set it up. I suppose the other consideration is licensing though. PfSense is free whereas an RRAS setup would need a Win Server license (could go with 180 day eval). I just embraced the dark side and went with a full-on M$ stack (Hyper-V, etc.) with eval licensing for my homelab and did the RRAS thing not too long ago."

There are of course many, many more monitoring solutions out there.  But these aren't really CMDB's, they're monitoring servers.  A CMDB is sorta like an inventory system thats tied to a change management process (or should be).  Many helpdesk systems have a CMDB option: ServiceNow, OTRS ITSM, Manage Engine, etc.  There are also standalone CMDB's but I haven't really used them.  Having some integration between the monitoring server and CMDB is really nice, but it can also get very complex and tedious to keep up to date.  The hardest thing in my experience is getting interdepartmental buyin to use one solution and share the responsibility of upkeep on the CMDB side of things."

With ~2000 VM's and thier hosts, plus some physical stuff floating around, the SAN's, networking, whatever, to support them.  It gets pretty serious.

homelab,39qwnt,darkkhhorse-,2,Sat Jun 13 22:20:35 2015 UTC,"Quite the contrary!  I have rarely ever seen the Celerons fully saturated.  Eventhough I rarely turn on the 2nd host.  I get away with this because not all of my VMs are active doing stuff at the same time.  ie: I am not streaming a movie while I am working on my lab doing other stuff, so the other VMs are sitting there idle - and vice versa.  -And I am very in tune with my setup.  I watch it very carefully. It is not blazing fast, but it is surprisingly capable of running anything I toss at it.  None of my VMs are allocated 2 vCPU except for my Plex VM on the rare chance it is streaming and transcoding 2 movies at once.  I did notice a real difference in the upgrade from my previous ESXi hosts running on 2x AMD 350 based CPUs though.  (These are really low wattage Intel Atom competitors that I got for really cheap)  Those were working hard most times and were quite underpowered for my given workload.  HOWEVER, they still did get the work done.  People like to assume that slower processors can't do work, like what do they NEED to run sharepoint or a web server or something.  You NEED a CPU, any will do.  The amount of performance you get is the question.  -Of course unless you are playing games, then you need to have power to make a game playable.  So my AMDs at the time did everything I wanted, I just had to wait.  I never had any error nor failure related to their lack of performance.  I did get sick of waiting though, which I think is were your question is headed.  With the Celerons, I am extremely happy with the performance.  If I didn't know they were Celerons, I wouldn't know they were Celerons based on their ability to do work efficiently.  I think right now, my biggest bottleneck is the disk.  If I am really working my lab, the disk is what I am waiting on, not the CPUs.  But again, this is rare and most of the time, even my disk is sitting idle."

You will need to setup a protocol and open it to the WAN in order to access your file server outside of your LAN. Yes, it's possible. But again, I always recommend the firewall be a bare metal server. It will work fine virtualized, too. I'm running Sophos virtualized until I am comfortable enough putting it on bare metal and into production.   You should create put your VM's on your RAID array.

homelab,39nn5l,sup3rlativ3,2,Sat Jun 13 02:38:44 2015 UTC,Not really a reason to do this unless you really need the extra cpu which is unlikely if he isn't sure about domains etc.  RAM is another story though. Put in as much as the board allows.
homelab,39nn5l,sup3rlativ3,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:38:37 2015 UTC,"Ok, currently it has 16GB of RAM. I am thinking about bumping it up to 32GB though. I don't think I could afford 64GB :D  Maybe I could Download RAM :D"

Imo Windows is better than freenas. 3: instead of using hyper v try using esxi and run pfsense in that, you'll get a lot less errors. It's free for home use.    Install esxi on your bare metal then install Windows server for your A.D. Best practice would be to install another server for your file services but it's really not required in your environment. Install pfsense vm configure vswitches etc for wan lan and your other networks.  If you need any pointers let me know, happy to help."

You could then install freenas as a vm, pass the sata controller to the vm, and then join freenas to your ad domain. Once that is all said and done, you can continue to spin up other vms on the same hardware at will. You could also do this with hyperv, but vmware has better support for non ms operating systems(ie freenas)  EDIT: Since you have already setup your ad servers, now is a great time to test your backup and restore plans!"
homelab,39mmoy,Rum_Rummy,6,Fri Jun 12 20:30:54 2015 UTC,"If you get a rack of sorts, your ePenis will be bigger and possibly more well trimmed and organized. I would keep it flat, not on carpet if you can help it and not in a hot area. They can run at 80-85 degrees fine, be it not ideal depending what you read. I think its Google that keeps their data centers at 80.  Google Link 1 Google Link 2"
homelab,39mmoy,NoThatsBobbysAsshole,2,Fri Jun 12 20:46:36 2015 UTC,Google that keeps their data centers at 80   This comes with a very large caveat and you need to be careful running data centers at 80.    There is a trade off between air cooling and air handling.  Running data centers hotter is safe as long as you increase your air flow/air handling in response.  The absolute temperature isn't as important as your delta temperature between cold and hot isles.  Its safe to run hot isles at 80 -- it assumes you have very strong airflow management.  With stronger airflow you can decrease the delta temperature (delta-t) between cold and hot.  Running cold isles at 80 can get very interesting very fast without proper air flow and a higher delta-t.  You also need to have more temperature sensors to achieve this and detect failures in the handlers or cooling sooner and throttle performance.

homelab,39mmoy,LFKhael,3,Fri Jun 12 21:59:14 2015 UTC,"Servers don't need to be in a rack, it just helps keep all the hot ends away from the cold ends. Much more critical in a room full of servers."
homelab,39mmoy,5ilver,3,Fri Jun 12 20:42:47 2015 UTC,I always wanted to do a vertical mount for a rack server with the butt of the server sticking up so that the intake got cool air and exhausted it up.
homelab,39mmoy,Legionof1,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:27:13 2015 UTC,"Servers are mounted horizontally in generally 42U+ rack. They have a cold side and hot side cooling system though. I do servers for a living :). My idea is for vertical mounting where instead of a hot or cold side you have cool air on the bottom and it sucks it up through the chassis and blows it up, it is also assisted by thermodynamics of hot air rising."
homelab,39mmoy,Legionof1,2,Sat Jun 13 09:39:46 2015 UTC,"All depends on what you're planning on doing I'd say. If you're only going to use a couple things either get a very small rack for ~$30 (2 post, can still work fine) or use a table. If you're going to be getting a bunch of switches and serves then a larger rack can help keep things organized.  Personally, I have a mid-size 2 post rack that is ~28U, with 2 HP servers just resting on the bottom then a bunch of mounted switches. It's incredibly stable but just looks a bit goofy perhaps.  As far as cooling goes, I wouldn't worry all that much about the equipment if your home is air conditioned. This isn't production gear, it's likely low-cost old stuff, so why spend a fortune to keep it ice cold? I've got 3 servers (1xTS440 & 2xDL380G5) running in a closet in my office, with the doors open, and the fans aren't even close to full speed. The room is probably a solid 5-8 degrees hotter than the rest of the house, but the servers are holding up perfectly fine. Some people will likely disagree with me on the climate requirements, but I say run it like it's a lab to screw around with and make sure you don't put it in a 90 degree room, it'll hold up fine."
homelab,39mmoy,uberamd,4,Sat Jun 13 13:55:07 2015 UTC,"You don't NEED a rack to use a rack mount enclosure...  But that's kind of the whole point of the rack mount form factor, IMO; Keeping everything organized and accessible.  If you don't want/need a rack, and are planning on just setting the thing somewhere, just get standard sized hardware. You'll end up saving some money, too."

They will pay for themselves in a few years depending on whether you do the work or hire it done.    The best thing you can do is be smart about your lab's needs and start with cheap and small CPUs and RAMs at first.  Then upgrade as needed where needed from there.  I started off with 3x AMD 350 based CPU boards for my home lab.  2 running ESXi and one running Freenas.  Got the boards and RAM cheap, plus they were very quiet.  Ran 2x 2TB 7200 RPM drives in a mirror for the Freenas.  This lasted for about 2 years or so.  Switched to a small Synology and ditched freenas.  Then a year or so later, swapped in 2x Celeron based motherboards to replace the AMD 350s.  Still running the celerons and 2 bay Synology to this day.  Next upgrade will be to a 5 or 8 drive Synology, but the cost is a problem, as I have been really cheap until this point, so the 800 that the Synology unit is going to run has me putting it off.  My current setup (one host turned off most times) consumes about 70 watts of power and is very quiet."

Reason being is the 771 Era ones consume more power than the 1366 era Processors. 771 Being Core based like the COre 2 Duo and COre 2 Quad and the 1366 being Nehalem so similar to the First Gen Core i7 Processors like the i7 920.  I would go with this my self it is cheaper eats up less power and has more expansion possibilities.  http://www.ebay.com/itm/Dell-Precision-T3500-Intel-Quad-Core-Xeon-W3550-3-06-GHz-17C4/171653856421?_trksid=p2047675.c100005.m1851&_trkparms=aid%3D222007%26algo%3DSIC.MBE%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D31729%26meid%3D85bf24f336d348449251c4d7be28e004%26pid%3D100005%26rk%3D2%26rkt%3D6%26sd%3D331555725750&rt=nc  I would buy that then upgrade the CPU to a Hexa core and upgrade the RAM it supports up to 6X4 RAM config so a great amount of RAM for the lab.

It will be kept on 24/7 but I don't know what you mean by the 'home network will sufer', unless you're referring to not being able to resolve dns with it off."
homelab,39kpip,ipat8,2,Fri Jun 12 21:40:48 2015 UTC,"What I mean is that if your server goes down, your network is pretty much in trouble, won't give out addresses and won't resolve anything.  I'd configure Google DNS on the DNS options and it's a great tool to learn how DNS works on windows, you have shitloads of options, play with reverse/forward, etc. DHCP also gives you a few more options and it's easier too manage (in my opinion).   I guess I just like to have it all in one place that I can manage completely rather than using my crappy router."
homelab,39kpip,stashtv,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:01:13 2015 UTC,I would advise not doing that. Pfsense doesn't play nice with emulated network adapters; it can be a real hassle to get working. If you need a router you'd be better off buying a Bay Trail Intel board and adding some NICs.

Why not take your Windows server and replace one of your linux VMs with a windows equivalent (DNS, http, etc)?

homelab,39kpip,chewieconcarne,4,Fri Jun 12 16:36:52 2015 UTC,"One Windows server VM isn't very much for actually gaining any meaningful experience.    Perhaps you should setup IIS and start doing some web hosting, perhaps write a .NET application.  Install 2012 R2 in Core mode with no GUI or only the basic server management GUI. Learn powershell.     Learn Kerberos.  Learn how to do integrated authentication with Kerberos,  including all the pains involved in getting DNS and service principals correct.  You could do better if you had two servers.    Then you could build an AD domain,  then build an Exchange server for e-mail, by downloading a trial copy of Exchange to go with your 2nd server.  With three servers, then you could build an AD domain, build an Exchange server, then build an ADFS server,  and work on getting your web applications and OWA  using ADFS for authentication instead of  form-based/integrated auth.  Or you could download a trial of Lync or Sharepoint and build a server to play with.   But you need a separate domain controller as a pre-requisite.   Many important Windows things are like that:  you can't use just one server.  Not only is it not a realistic environment to not have at least 2 or 3 windows servers,  But it's actually not supported to install  most applications on a domain controller, but you do need at least 1 domain controller  with servers joined to the domain, for many applications.  The average enterprise environment needs 6 or 7 servers,  to get basic services up.....

Honestly, I might just run unlicensed. It's really not that different morally or functionally than the above method, and it's a whole lot easier.

Reinstalling or reconfiguring Wordpress to do that is simple, I'd hit google and read up. Configure dynamic DNS updates so that your DNS A record points to the public external IP (which I assume is dynamic, due to being residential internet service)  Configure ""DMZ"" or NAT on your firewall/router.  You need it to NAT the external IP to the internal IP.  This should be pretty simple, and guides are available all over the net for every firewall/router. Test from the outside.  You should be fine. Consider connecting your residential internet service to two firewalls/routers.  One for this, and one for your internal network.

Rolling Back to Previous BIOS and Firmware Versions  USC enables you to roll back to a previously-installed version of BIOS or firmware. Dell recommends that you use this feature if you have a problem with the currently-installed version and want to revert to the previously-installed version.  NOTE: Only BIOS and firmware can be rolled back. USC, the Dell Diagnostics application, and drivers needed for operating system (OS) installation cannot be rolled back to earlier versions. This feature is available only if you have used the USC update feature to update BIOS and firmware, or if you have updated the system BIOS or firmware using a post-OS Dell Update Package. If you have used other update methods, this feature is not available.  NOTE: Power supply firmware does not support creation of a rollback image if it is updated using a post-OS Dell Update Package.  NOTE: If you have updated your system's BIOS or firmware only once, the rollback feature offers the option of reverting to the factory-installed BIOS or firmware images. If you have updated your BIOS or firmware more than once, the factory-installed images are overwritten and you cannot revert to them. Step 1: Launch the Rollback Wizard     1. Boot your system to launch USC. When the Dell logo displays, press the <F10> key within 10 seconds.      2. Click Platform Update in the left pane.      3. Click Launch Rollback Update in the right pane.  Step 2: Select and Apply Rollbacks The Select Rollbacks screen displays a list of available rollback images.     1. Select the check box of each rollback image that you want to apply to the system.  To compare the version of the rollback image with the version currently installed on the system, compare the versions in the Current and Previous fields.  NOTE: An ellipsis (...) appearing at the end of the displayed field indicates that the full value is not displayed. To view more detailed information, select the field; the information appears below the comparison report.     ○ Component — Displays the available updates; select the check box of each update you want to apply.     ○ Current — Displays the component version currently installed on the system.     ○ Previous — Displays the version of the rollback image.     • Click Apply.   NOTE: The system reboots after the update process is complete. When applying more than one update, the system may need to reboot between updates.

It is a type 1 hypervisor though.  Just doesn't seem like one because its privileged kernel is NT ;)"

homelab,39j3e0,Reset_Assured,2,Fri Jun 12 13:20:17 2015 UTC,"Well, Microsoft does have RemoteFX, and Hyper-V leverages what you might call a ""Direct3D Paravirtual"" driver. Essentially, it uses an emulated 2D video device and then passes through the D3D calls to a D3D hardware device/driver running on the host. I think.  It's a royal pain in the ass to even play with it, and in the tests I did a couple years ago with Radeon 5850s, it couldn't even begin to reach the performance I got from simple PCI passthrough on ESXi. However, the advantage to Microsoft's approach here is that it scales the same way SR-IOV does, but doesn't require explicit hardware support. Naturally, due to building a boatload of VM frame buffers, it was best suited to high-memory workstation cards anyway...  This was the machine I tried it with. Seen running ESXi + Win7 VMs, as that gave great performance.  http://imgur.com/BH0AoR9  http://imgur.com/SHBsoqI"

I can learn Hyper-V at home so I can say I am comfortable and knowledgeable of both. The whole vSphere/vCenter not being free in ESXi 5 really turned me off of ESXi.  They could at least provide a limited version of vCenter that limits the number of hosts or VMs you can manage.  Not sure what's changed about this subject in v6, I guess they realized they needed to keep vSphere around?  I specialize in Windows... so Hyper-V Windows runs really well in Hyper-V especially if you use versions of Windows that can be run in the Gen2 hardware version Ubuntu 14.04 LTS supports the Hyper-V Gen2 hardware version with secure boot turned off - Dynamic memory works!  When I do need Linux, I try to get whatever working on Ubuntu. I get Windows Desktop/Server for free."

Hyper-V is solid in an all-Windows environment; VMWare seems to have a bit more use overall and I like some of its features. You probably have more potential for formal certifications with Windows if that is your aim, and I think learning to control everything with PowerShell is a must as Microsoft's Windows Server division continues its warpath to eliminate GUI administration as a default option.

The lack of a quality central management interface for Hyper-V is one reason I don't enjoy it.  The vendor lock in for ESXi is a reason I don't enjoy that path.  At home I decided on something FOSS.  I was going to go down the Xenserver or KVM route until I came across Proxmox.  You have got to at least check it out.  It runs full virtualization VMs via KVM but also utilizes containers, which are sort of a slimmed down VM sharing the host kernel.  I honestly think it's the future.

On a similar note, the newer versions of VMWare (5.5 and 6.0) ESXi seem to be sucking.  I've heard a few 6.0 horror stories, and I've had my own issues with 5.5 acting funny.

It would provide you with all you could need plus you will learn a lot of things other bundled nases do automagically for you. If you build a pc for nas pourposes, 8 gb ram is enough for 6 tb storage so you can use deduplication and compression. The recommendation is 1gb ram per storage tb minimum.  Being power consumption an issue, do you consider buying 2,5 SAS drives to put them directly into your proliant? (DAS). You could pass them with passthru to a VM and install freenas in that VM so it can handle them exclusively and provide you the NAS in the same hardware. It will not be hardware fault tolerant of course, but it will be much cheaper than having 2 real machines (power consumption, space requeriments, heat, noise... you know). I wouldn't do that in a real enterprise, but for a home i think is more than enough if you don't want your house full of machines."

homelab,39hy7c,lordairivis,12,Fri Jun 12 13:27:44 2015 UTC,"In my setup, firewalld is disabled (systemctl disable firewalld.service && systemctl stop firewalld.service), and I have SELinux disabled (sed -i /etc/selinux/config -r -e 's/SELINUX=.*/SELINUX=disabled/g').   This is just lazy.  Why not learn how to configure these properly to work with these applications rather than taking the lazy route and disabling them?  Doing this reduces security on the machine you'll be using to download from shady places - not the best idea."
homelab,39hy7c,iRawrz,2,Thu Jun 11 23:47:40 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your concern. I do know how to conigure firewalld and selinux, but I don't use selinux. I do use firewalld in my home network, but only when a system has inbound originated traffic. With this server, I proxy the Web front ends through a Nginx server (which does use firewalld). From my hardware firewall, I block all inbound traffic other than 443 and 22, and those ports are set to two specific servers. Thus, no one is getting directly to my Usenet server, so I keep things simple and turn off firewalld. I willingly accept any risk by not running firewalld on my internal servers.    EDIT: In fact, here is my simple setup for my reverse proxy.  If you have any recommendations on how to make that more secure, I'm all ears."

homelab,39hbm3,cephran,5,Thu Jun 11 18:40:48 2015 UTC,"Why do you think those two CPUs are comparable? The Xeon has more L3 cache, and the more cores would be way better for both compiling as well as transcoding.   If you're looking for just a server check out the Intel NUCs. They are also fairly low power but have desktop processors in them as well.  The brix would be better for a dual purpose machine, but at that price point there are quite a few better options.  (Remember, both the Brix AND the NUCs do not come with RAM or storage, so you'll have to get those as well.)"
homelab,39hbm3,fooxzorz,2,Thu Jun 11 18:50:09 2015 UTC,"I don't  think the CPUs are comparable, but cpubenchmark puts them at about the same performance level.  The NUCs are awesome, but I'd like more peak performance for compiling and VMs.  I mostly care about the low idle power usage/high peak performance combination.   Can you recommend something else that meets these requirements? Preferrably not a rack server though. :-("
homelab,39hbm3,fooxzorz,2,Thu Jun 11 18:56:13 2015 UTC,"Depending on what synthetic benchmarks were used its possible they would appear to be similar performance levels. Especially if the benchmark wasn't highly threaded.   I'll agree after checking out the NUCs again, it seems like they are the lower power versions of desktop CPUs, so not the best idea if you're looking for horsepower.  Are you willing to build the computer yourself? If you are that opens up a lot of possibilities."
homelab,39hbm3,fooxzorz,2,Thu Jun 11 19:10:58 2015 UTC,"Whitebox build? Yes! Requirements are VTd, <20W idle power, i7 quad core performance, 16GB RAM are sufficient. Ideas?  EDIT: As small as possible."
homelab,39hbm3,fooxzorz,4,Thu Jun 11 19:14:14 2015 UTC,"Most of those requirements are easy, but getting less than 20W idle power usage is not really easy unless you want to majorly sacrifice performance. I've got a pentium G3258 on a serverboard with 16GB ECC RAM and a couple hard drives, no video card and it doesn't go below ~30W. You might be able to manage to get close with a single HDD or SSDs for storage unless you already have a separate solution for that.   But anyways, here's my suggestion; i7 4790K because if you want more performance you can overclock quite a bit so long as you get a good heatsink. I'm not sure of what hardware requirements/compatability KVM has, so either any regular/cheaper z97 board with 4 RAM slots for future upgrades of RAM, and some 1600MHz 2x8GB RAM kit. Throw it in whatever case that fits, add a 80+ PSU with ~400w from Corsair, FSP, Antec or Seasonic and you've got yourself a decent horsepower server."

homelab,39hbm3,crasyphreak,2,Thu Jun 11 19:38:36 2015 UTC,"So long as the hypervisor OS lets the CPU downclock or go into power saving mode, reguardless of what your overclock is, the idle power usage can be fairly low. Less than 40w should be expected as long as you don't put too many hard drives in it. Not entirely positive how much it would use and it might take some playing around to get it lower but that's true of most computers. It would end up being more expensive than the Brix, but you would be getting a computer that doesn't overheat, a CPU that is even more powerful as well as overclock able, and expand-ability and upgradability which you wouldn't have with the Brix or NUCs."
homelab,39hbm3,freythman,2,Thu Jun 11 19:46:07 2015 UTC,"Well, here is my reasoning: 1) i5 NUC, 2 cores, 4 threads, 10 W idle 2) brix pro 4 cores, 8 threads, 15W-20W idle, more than 2,5x peak performance 3) i7-something, 4 cores, 8 threads 40W idle, about 3x peak performance compared to NUC  Brix pro seems to be the sweet spot for idle power/performance/cost. I don't need expandability.   I'd be very glad if you could point out flaws in my reasoning."

The i7 in the Brix won't run at max speed for very long, so your ""peak performance"" comparison is pretty generous when you want to have sustained usage. Linus's review of the Brix showed that lower performance small form factor computers actually tended to match the performance of the Brix because of the thermal throttling. Thats the only issue I have with your reasoning.  It looks like there will be a i7 NUC released soon so if you aren't in a rush i'd look into that too."

You have a small network of 20 or less devices, so there is little to no sustained CPU load for these type of VMs.  A spike here and there is typical, but not cause for adding more vCPU.  You will see better performance and LEARN more about what really needs what when you under allocate and then monitor.  Get some perfmon going on your Windows VMs and google for information about what to monitor and what graph means you need more CPU.  Getting smart here will really benefit you as your needs and experience grow.  You will be able to run more VMs on your given hardware if it is not overallocated and experiencing CPU ready times due to excessive scheduling, plus you will be able to intelligently communicate to your coworkers why you are not giving them the vCPU they ask for initaly, will monitor and hot add as needed in the future.  I have this conversation with my coworkers daily.  The old adage 'more is better' doesn't necessarily apply in the VM world.  You want your VMs to sustain 80% CPU utilization.  This is a properly sized VM.  If it needs what they ask for, let the VM show it in the real world.  Heck, it might need more than they ask for.  If it needs it, it gets it, no questions asked."

If you can afford it (or borrow it) get a certifier as well as a toner too. You can use dish soap instead of wire lube. Get a buddy to help. Get plenty of keystones, wall plates, and low voltage brackets from monoprice. If it's residential, you don't need plenum cable despite what a lot of people will say. You won't be running through any moving air spaces so save the money and get riser. Plan EVERYTHING out before you start so you have all the pieces parts you'll need when the day/days come to do the install. Get a drywall saw and a good measuring tape. Measure the outlet locations from the edge of the wall and make sure you can positively identify that wall when you're in the attic. I wouldn't spring for conduit unless money isn't a factor. Realistically, you won't be upgrading for many years, and when you do it'll be easy to use the existing cables as a fish for the new ones. Want to add a wire? Tie two to the existing cable and pull them through. Conduit is stupidly expensive. Get plenty of velcro ties to corral all the bundles (I used over 100). You'll need a drill and some speedbore bits to drill into the headers of the walls.  Be prepared to get sweaty, tired, and full of fiberglass. It's a lot of work, but is ultimately rewarding. Feel free to PM me with any questions."
homelab,39aihp,ender4171,3,Wed Jun 10 18:48:52 2015 UTC,"Eh, conduit isn't exactly bank-breaking.  You can get 200 feet of blue conduit of $40 at lowes (that's not including any sales or whatever).  Plus, you're also covered in case the cable breaks (critters, misplaced nail, fraying, etc).  You can easily re-run it.    As far as securing the lines, when I've run straight cable, it's not that simple to re-run it.  You generally want to secure the cable to walls itself to keep it neat, and that tends to preclude just tying more cable and re-pulling it.  However, if you run conduit, you can secure THAT to the walls to keep it neat (as long as you avoid the tighter angles as much as possible), and run/re-run with ease.  You're right that it's not absolutely needed, but in my experience it doesn't add a lot of cost or time, and makes things MUCH easier in the future, which is why I'll always run conduit when I have to run wire."

Pull up wire to attic level, and tie off to twine (label top of wire) Repeat until all lower outlets are now fed w/ cable Feed twine across attic and down to networking closet Have buddy start pulling twine slowly, while you free any kinks or snags (in attic), if you have 2nd buddy- his job is to straighten anything snagging going ""into"" the wall on the main level. Punch down all wall jacks - use TIA/EIA 568-B standard Tone out wires to ensure labeling Label patch panel and wall jacks Terminate cables to patch panel - Use TIA/EIA 568-B standard Test cable pin-outs Enjoy   This is going to be a ""TASK"" to say the least.  If you total up the cost of the tools and materials, you may find it worth your weekend and sanity to hire a professional to do it (usually $80-100 per run w/ materials).  If you do decide to do it yourself, I tend to run 2 jacks per outlet.  To do this; just double your measurements, and tie the twine to the middle of the cable, cut the cable in half once it's dangling in the network closet.  TaaDah - you now ran 2 cables and only had to pull 1 string.  Other piece of advice that I can give is ensure that your sticks can reach the outlet from the ceiling.  If they can't, move over a stud.  It a common mistake for outlets to be cut first, and then find that there's no clear run to the attic; leaving you to either patch your hole or open a HUGE hole to notch out obstruction to allow cable to pass.  Drilling the hole at the crown of the stud and feeling down saves you from having to patch drywall and paint (extra work = extra cost & lost time).  I don't recommend just laying the wire on top of the joists, but will do for home use.

homelab,39aihp,Mike12344321,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:10:57 2015 UTC,"As long as you are doing it to interior walls in a 1 story house, getting the cable to the hole is usually quite easy.  If you go up in the attic and move the insulation to the side, you'll likely find that there is simply a gap and you can see down into the wall and getting a cable down into that space will be easy.  Exterior walls are much harder, both because you often can't get directly over the wall in the attic and because insulation is in the way so you can't just drop a cable into the void.  To start, you take a mounting plate, trace it, and then cut that hole into the wall.  Then, from the attic looking down into the wall, you'll be able to see the rectangle of light to give you something to aim at.  Try to drop the cable down to line up with the light, and make sure it is long enough to go past the light.  Then go into the room, reach into the hole, and grab the cable.  Worst case is you missed a bit and need to go back to the attic and try to line up better with the hole so you can reach it.  Once you can grab it, pull it out through the bracket and flip the arms of the bracket out to attach it to the wall.  Now, the only hard part, which isn't terribly hard if you practice a few times first, is putting the wire into the keystone jack.  At that point, you're done.  The brackets I used didn't have screws and are simply secured by the metal arms folding back, but otherwise what I did is like this video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbqoKz3yI9E&t=33"

In that case the homeowner is looking at finding the location of the outlet on the wall, determining the closest stud (that doesn't have water, power or gas running along it) then figuring out where on that top 2x4 the hole into the wall needs to be drilled. Then drill, feed wire down and get it out of the hole they have previously cut for the outlet.    If you've done any post-build wiring (network or electric) it's easy. If not, then there will be some hit and miss.

Patience, a friend who has done it before and time help as well.    Edit: My friend just bought a new house and we ran a total of 52 lines over something like 20-25 drops throughout the house.

In general though you are just trying to get the cable from a patch panel to the jack. Try to make sure the cable does not get kinked and is well supported e.g. don't hang it across nails and use cable hooks if needed.   Other than that it really just depends how nice you want it to look. You might invest in some race way if you need to run across a wall and I would recommend using boxes weather in wall or just sticky ones to protect the terminations on your jack.  As for your actual questions:   2.) What hardware is needed? I assume a spindle of cat6, crimpers, wall plates (keystones?), anything else?   You will need a pair of cable strippers made for network cable. Zipties and Velcro to help organize. Sharpies to number both ends of each cable. I would use a patch panel also.   3.) How do I physically run wire from an attic to a tiny hole in the wall in a room? Sounds very difficult.   I would run straight up from the rack into the attic, pull the cable from your ""server room"" to the drop location leaving 2-3 feet on either end to allow for mistakes. You can use something called fish tape to run cables though walls if necessary. However if you can avoid running up walls, taping pliers to the end of the cable will make going down a wall a breeze."
homelab,39aihp,eleitl,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:33:11 2015 UTC,"Ethernet connectors are commonly referred to as RJ45.  The correct term for them is 8P8C but the term RJ45 is so often used that you'll shop for them using the term RJ45.  You can terminate the cables in the closet with RJ45 connectors and plug them directly into the switch, but terminating RJ45 connectors is difficult and requires a crimping tool that's expensive if you want a high quality tool.  There are of course cheaper versions of the tool, but they increase the chance of making a poor connection.  It's much easier in terms of achieving good connections to terminate the cables into a patch panel.  Patch panels require the same tool as the keystone jacks and have the benefit of flexibility in the configuration after the installation is complete.  From the patch panel, short store bought ethernet cables connect to the switch.  Those are known as patch cables.    You can use the same patch panel to distribute phone service without making any changes.  There are two standards for terminating ethernet into patch panels and jacks:  TIA 568A  TIA 568B  The difference between the two is the color order.  The patch panel and keystone jacks will be marked for both.  Whichever one you choose is arbitrary but you need to use the same for all connections.  You could actually make your own order if you want as long as you use it at all terminations, but following one of the two standards is of course much easier.  The most commonly used one is 568B.  https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+to+punch+ethernet+cable  This search result gives you some good videos for terminating the wiring."

Use a wall/network rack to mount the patch panels and the switch, plus your router/firewall, and perhaps other goodies (UPS, NAS, server, whatever). Make sure to get quality cable. Cat 6e, perhaps. Dual cable makes pulling easier. I used a Digitus S/FTP Category 7 shielded LSOH cable (DK-1741-VH-D-5 2x(4x2x23#)). Make sure to use high quality Ethernet wall sockets, which match your cable (e.g. CAT 7 has oversize copper which might not fit your CAT 5 or CAT 6 Ethernet sockets). You don't need a crimp tool, since you can buy preconfigured cables at any length, and you'll use these between the patch panel and the switch.  I can't tell you how to run cables because I have no idea how your house looks like. The optimal way is with wall ducts. If you have drywall then you'll probably need nylon pullers.

homelab,39cm5z,cwyble,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:56:54 2015 UTC,Budget is around £3000 ($5000 US).  I'm not bringing any pre-bought equipment into this so I'll have to purchase everything I need.

homelab,39bl8r,Legionof1,2,Wed Jun 10 17:56:14 2015 UTC,O_o Raid 10 gives a 100% speed boost over a single spindle with 4 drives.   So 4 SSDs would be a 2X read/write increase roughly.

homelab,39bl8r,onenerdyguy,-2,Fri Jun 12 02:07:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the problem would be having something that can use that speed. Sure it'll be fast, but if you have nothing that can use the speed, it's like having a ferrari you never have a need to take above 40 mph"
homelab,39bl8r,Legionof1,3,Wed Jun 10 18:28:53 2015 UTC,9 VMs running off of it could use it depending on demand. I use 2 SSDs in a RAID 0 for the OS/games (backed up) partion on my desktop and enjoy the 1GB/s Read. a RAID 1 would also be a suitable option for redundancy.

""Balanced"" is good for your power bill, but Hyper-V (and any other virtual bare metal OS) aren't terribly responsive in ramping up CPU speed in response to VM load.  Give this a try.  RDP to your core OS and open up powershell:  powercfg -getactivescheme  This will probably come back with ""balanced"". If so, do a:  powercfg -list  That will give you a guid list of your power schemes.  You should have available one listed with a description of ""High performance"", cut and paste the high perf guid into this statement:  powercfg -setactive <guid>  See if that helps.  Also, if you want to do a quick and dirty elimination of your raid 5 being the issue (which it may or may not be, raid 5 isn't automatically the devil), storage move one of your VMs vmdk temporarily to the SSD if it will fit and see what happens."
homelab,39bl8r,bahwhateverr,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:48:12 2015 UTC,I run similar specs above and have no problems with disk IO even running full nested Hyper-V labs.  Add more ssd's.  Spinning disk is only used for backups and cold storage.

homelab,39bl8r,Magnus919,0,Fri Jun 12 18:49:01 2015 UTC,"If you can get your heavy use VMs moved to a group of SSDs, this would be your best bet.  Then your non interactive VMs, big VMs, backup data and etc. can be stored and used from the slower spinning disks.   The option of adding more spinning disks would help too, but if you don't need the space, a spinning disk won't give you anywhere near the speed boost you might be looking for.  Adding another host would help, but if you don't need the added CPU and RAM, then the SSD idea would still be your best bet."

homelab,39aw45,-Bismarck,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:12:53 2015 UTC,"a NUC, VLAN capable switch, and whatever other networking gear you want can accomplish most of your learning goals. It will be quiet and efficient. with virtualization, cpu rarely is the bottleneck. It usually comes down to memory usage.  I wish I would have gone the route of NUCs or a smaller form factor atom board with 32gb of memory, for the same money..  with the NUCs they only have one NIC, but you can trunk the switch port to the NUC and in esxi (assuming you're virtualizing) can vlan off port groups.   if you dont want to spend that kind of money...  get a larger form factor dell poweredge, the 4u's are way more quiet.  I'm running two xeon white boxes (storage, and esxi) and without constant cooling my office gets up in the 80s easily. Basically a lot of horsepower that's maybe being utilized 5% most of the time.

This outgoing policy will limit what an attacker can do once they've compromised a system on your network. Heres what it does: 1. prevent your computer from becoming part of a botnet 2. blocks a script that made an outgoing connection to download the rest of the malware. 3. A server doesn't need to be able to reach the web (or its own updates) apart from the time of the day where it is updating... So if attacked at another period, having outgoing http/https/ssh/whatever blocked will help reducing the attacker's ability to download a payload or use your network in some way 4. Malware can install a keylkogger on a system and the outgoing policy will block it from ""calling home"" Now if you don't have a firewall that does this you need to install a personal firewall on each server I would recommend using Eset/Nod32 Smart Security.

Someone's brilliantly over-engineered idea obviously.   You have to use a screwdriver to force the moving part to lever the release far enough and then somehow, at the same time, work the SFP loose.

I am not sure about shipping to Alaska, but the Lenovo TS140 might be a fit for you, and it is fairly cheap to get in the States. The Core i3 version is about $280, but the more powerful Xeon is on sale over at Newegg right now.  I went for the extra power in the Xeon. I didn't get the attractive US pricing, being in Canada, but I absolutely love it. Its quiet and efficient (280W PSU), and mine is running several Windows VM's (I think I am up to 6 now) without breaking a sweat. Not doing any VOIP, but it is doing AD, DNS, DHCP, file sharing, Plex, IIS, and SQL Express, although those last two are just sitting idle.  The best thing I like about it is the Intel AMT, which only comes in the Xeon. After setting that up, I moved it to the basement where it sits out of the way, no mouse, keyboard or monitor. And I can take physical control of it whenever I want, just as if I was sitting in front of it. :)  If you need more than 4 drive bays (although I read somewhere that it can do 5), then you might want to check out it's larger cousin, the TS440."

Rundeck/slack (configuration management)/ELG(raylog)/OSSEC/Analogi on my linux vm. AD/Exchange/SharePoint/SystemCenter/DNS/CA on my windows 2k12r2 VM. Of course pfsense terminates the road warrior and site to site IPsec/openvpn connections and provides OSPF (primary) routing. Oh a Centos VM running Zenoss/OpenVAS.  I also have a public facing virtual machine hosting my various domains, providing owncloud and misc stuff for my personal use and my business (my business is just launching, it's purpose is to provide paid on demand access to an entire networking/test lab (I figured I should monetize my home lab).   The ""prodish"" lab support infrastructure runs on a physical Dell OptiPlex 7(x)5 in my homelab. 1tb internal drive, 1tb external backup drive (yay 2k12r2 backups) 5tb external drive (Tahoe immutable ""wormish"" log store, ios/iso/pxe blah blah store). I've got a physical Linux box as well. It will probably be retired and have it's functionality moved to the OVH VM (it's hard drive is dying, and I don't really need a local linux box when 2k12r2 can do everything I need and I can use the prod VM to just reference the Windows box for things like PXE etc).  I also have two ""pancake"" computers (MSI units, super low profile, 2 Ethernet ports, wifi). One is an inline, active IPS, the other is a router/firewall/IDS/net tap.    I have 6 10 port pdus (managed of course), daisychained off an acs48 console server.   The actual lab devices..... wow. Too many to list. Um I have a 6509 (linecards/sup/ips/nam) at the base of r1. Then enough switches/routers/phones/access points (with some l3 switch upgrades and ISR router model bumps coming soon from a friend) that the entire CCNAPIE (R&S/Voice/Wifi/Security) should be pretty much covered and just about any real world testing you might need. Oh I also have Ubiquiti and mikrotik gear and some random soho stuff (firebox).   R2 is my client rack.

I don't recommend it 1. because of the unsupported hardware and 2. because its so slow. Ive had trouble with a 7200rpm drive in my first home lab. If it got too much load my whole lab would crash. I couldn't reboot 2 VMs at the same time.  The best you can do (from my experience) is buy a SSD i guess. This will resolve storage problems. And with thin provisioning your VMs you can put quite allot on the drive.

homelab,399fhy,nixx,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:02:54 2015 UTC,"There are 2 reasons for this:   FreeNAS does not have a support agreement with us, we have no way to talk to their engineering department for example and discuss issue, so it's basically unsupported because our engineering has no one to talk to. We cannot escalate or engage the vendor. This is for both NFS and iSCSI. There are some commercial implementations that signed an agreement with VMware, and in this case, they will appear on the HCL. Not sure about FreeNAS itself, but we have come across multiple iSCSI implementation that modify the standard IET in order to gain performance or cater to a specific market, regardless, the end result is that they break the iSCSI enough to cause corruption. Remember that ESXi is almost unique because of the shared filesystem model and the locking we use."
homelab,399fhy,nixx,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:08:34 2015 UTC,"FreeNAS is basically the open source version of TrueNAS by iXSystems, which is included in the HCL.  The reason FreeNAS isn't licensed is because it is completely separate from the hardware, and also updated a bit more frequently.  I believe the iSCSI implementation is similar between both distros, but cannot say with 100% confidence.    I recall reading that TrueNAS technicians pretty much only recommend iSCSI connections when using their devices as a SAN, but they also build the hardware for the purpose, rather than the general home use grab bag of parts that often happens, so performance can vary for people."

You will find that using the simonics method is more reliable and easier.   You need to understand that someone else converting your gvoice to a sip trunk is really no different than you ordering a line through a provider. You still host your own pbx, using your own number, but you need a trunk line to make/receive calls. Making your gvoice line do that for you on your own hardware is tricky. There are some tutorials out there for it. Search around and try. I would suggest setting up another gmail account for you to play with too. Practice running 2 gvoice lines on your PBX"

Does your work PBX have you setup for more than one registration? or will you kill your work phone when you want to bring up your home PBX?  After that it sounds like you already had the 9971's configured in CME. If not that's not TOO difficult.  Once CME has your phones attached, and you have the registration sorted out with your work SIP, a few dial peers later and BOOM! inbound/outbound calling via your work extension."
homelab,398bwl,uid_zero,1 point,Fri Jun 12 05:58:29 2015 UTC,"I have multiple extensions.  I run the phone system at work, so I gave myself a separate extension for home that rings with my normal extension.  We use Asterisk at work, so I'm dealing with two very different systems.  I'll have to try it again, I haven't had the time to sit and play with that router and my phone lately.  I've got too much else going on."
homelab,398bwl,SherSlick,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:32:58 2015 UTC,Forgive me as I don't know much of anything on Asterisk. However if you have Asterisk setup for a sip device to register you can use the routers SIP User Agent to register against the Asterisk server trunk style.  Once that connection is made and CME is up and letting inter-phone calls work for it you can then configure the call routing from the SIP UA into the CME phones.  From what I understand of your setup it seems like all you need are Dial Peers that will take the calls and send them in the correct directions for you.

In short you will need a peer that takes the ""inbound"" calls (destination 1234) from your work extension, and a peer that matches ""outbound"" calls (destination 3032224444)  You can use some translation patterns to take the work extension and modify it into your home dial plan (example 1234 to 3400) because your work extension is getting the call as far as the CME is concerned."

I moved out of my current place and since I had to unplug the server I decided to try an open source solution instead of free ESXi and Proxmox is the thing that everyone was recommending so I installed it.   At first the performance of my KVMs and containers were horrible (IOWait trough the roof).I was using some pretty standard desktop HDDs (WD Blues). I realized that I've chosen IDE for the disk type and that the cache writing was disable.  So I recreated all my VMs using virtIO disk and set the cache to Write Back. The performance drastically improved and I'm barely getting any IOWait now. I tried a container for Plex since they have  better performance than KVM but had some trouble mounting my network folder from my NAS (OpenMediaVault on another VM). I decided to go the VM route for anything that requires a mount of a network drive and those include my usenet box and plex. So far everything has been working wonderfully

I then go on my VMs and modify the fstab to mount the network drive at boot.   The catch is I need to make sure my OMV VM boots first otherwise the other VMs won't be able to mount the drive. This can be done in Proxmox by setting a boot delay and a boot order  This way I have 1 drive to store the VMs and 1 drive for centralized storage  I don't own a NAS device either and virtio with cache to ""Write Back"" for local HDD was the way to go for me.

Mine was a solid deal or at least appeared to be at $199, although I did get the i3 model. Unfortunately, I easily spent another $100+ on drive trays for it.  My model came with a full-size cdrom instead of the slimline + hdd cage as well, even though the picture showed differently. There are a lot of TS140 models out there, each with a different configuration, so just be careful that you are getting what you want."
homelab,3969oa,tlazarus,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:56:16 2015 UTC,TS140's dont need drive trays do they?
homelab,3969oa,canhazraid,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:59:02 2015 UTC,"Maybe ""trays"" is the wrong term. To install the drive itself, you need a plastic sleeve that screws around the drive. Then the entire thing slides into a few different places - one is under the slim optical drive but in the same bay, and another is into a fan-cooled cooled tray in the second 5.25 bay. My version of the TS140 didn't come with the slim optical drive, which removes one possible location, nor did it include the fan-cooled tray in the second bay. This leaves only two remaining spots for drives, one at the bottom of the case, and one under the second 5.25 bay. Since I needed more than 2 drives, I ended up purchasing 2 of the fan-cooled trays as well as a few of the plastic sleeves off of ebay. The fan-cooled trays can be used in both 5.25"" bays if you don't want an optical drive.  This is the tray converter needed for installing 3.5"" drives in the 5.25"" bay:  ThinkServer 3.5"" HDD to 5.25"" Tray Convertor Kit  And this is the slim-line optical unit with room for a second drive:  3.5"" HDD to 5.25"" Tray Convertor with Slim ODD Kit  Finally, this document shows the way too many different models available:  TS140 Models"
homelab,3969oa,tlazarus,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:13:09 2015 UTC,"Mine came with the slim optical drive, but I haven't tried sliding a drive in there yet. Do you need one of the plastic sleeve thingys to put one in there, or does the drive just slide in? Mine only came with two of them, like yours, so hopefully I can just directly screw it in.  Mine did not come with the 5.25"" fan-cooled tray kit either, so that will be an extra expense if I want to put an HDD in the second 5.25"" bay."
homelab,3969oa,Stealth022,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:59:23 2015 UTC,"If it is like any of the other drive locations, you need a sleeve. I don't have the slim optical, so I can't confirm this 100%.

homelab,3969oa,LHD21,2,Wed Jun 10 17:53:39 2015 UTC,"So this is somewhat indirectly related.  I have an RS140 and a friend has two TS440s.  The RS140 comes with dedicated video memory and two NICs built in. The TS440 comes with shared video memory and a single off brand NIC.   If you have something that requires a specific amount of memory, you have to make sure you account for the video mem set aside.  When his TS440s arrived with 4 gigs of mem he went to install VMware and it spit out an error saying he only had 3.8 gigs of mem due to the video set aside.  I did not have the same issue with my RS140.  It ran for a few months with the original 4 gigs since it's only hosting my router VM.  When his other memory showed up VMware then said he didn't have a network card and wouldn't install. I found the drivers online and slipstreamed them into an ISO for him.  My RS140 has a BMC/KVM port but I've never successfully connected to it. I've seen the pretty login screen but can't seem to make it work.  I have the DRAC on all my other boxes setup and working without issue so it's not like I've never done it before.  I don't think the TS140/TS440s come with a BMC so you don't have to worry about it but it's functionality I'd want.    I boot my RS140 from a USB drive.  It has plenty of both USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 ports but for whatever reason if I don't have a USB keyboard plugged in, it won't boot.  If you try to remotely reboot it, it will POST then say there's no boot device found.  You have to plug a keyboard in and then power cycle and it boots fine.  Other than that it's been a good machine but I don't think I'd buy one at this point.  I really like Lenovo desktop gear but I don't think their server line is mature yet.  It may work fine for you lab though."

I have the client installed in a VM on my Mac and also in a VM on my ESXi host. I just RDP to my Windows VM when I want to manage ESXi. VMware Fusion can do it too but it doesn't have nearly all of the features, unfortunately. I was hoping I could manage the datastores and spin up new VMs with all of the same options as the Windows client.  People here like Proxmox a lot as well, and I hear it's not too difficult to set up. ESXi is pretty damn simple though, you install it on a flash drive, boot from the drive, set a few parameters and you're ready to remote in with vSphere. I had the core configuration set up in one night and got most of my VMs spun up over the course of the week. It's been fun :)"
homelab,3969oa,Stealth022,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:57:11 2015 UTC,I'm a little disappointed I'd have to use Windows for vSphere. It's still on the list to look at and proxmox is now too.
homelab,3969oa,PriceZombie,2,Wed Jun 10 03:00:19 2015 UTC,"Just an FYI from my experience.  90% of the places I've worked or contracted with have used some flavor of ESXi 4.0 - 5.5, somewhere in their environment. Frequently it will be their local infrastructure (mail, AD, DNS, SharePoint, Time & Expense) that they just want to work without hassle while they might use something sexier on a customer project.  I can almost without a doubt say that I'll find ESXi somewhere unless they have a vested interest in a competing product, like Cisco gear.  A coworker and I walked into a customer in-house data center once and everything was Juniper.  We were remarking how it was odd there wasn't an odd Cisco switch/router somewhere or a Netgear/D-link/TP-Link switch tucked away in a corner.  Come to find out they were owned by Juniper.  I'd say that of the ~40 companies I've been involved with in the last 5 years, the majority of the other hypervisors are RHEV/oVirt.  I've seen a huge shift away from KVM for everyone who's not using OpenStack.  Also Xen seems to be popular for people who do VDI but I couldn't tell you the last time I saw it used for infrastructure servers.  I've only ever seen HyperV used by the government.  They really seem to love it though.  Just some thoughts based on my sample size of 1.  I'm not sure if you want to learn about the hypervisor or just need one to use."

Think of it like a download manager when you're downloading a large file from a web server.  If you use a download manager to connect the server multiple times, the throughput is generally better than if you just used the browser to download natively.  This is because each of the flows are load balanced and queued separately on any routers/switches between the source and the destination.  If you only have one connection, the nic teaming driver will always make the same decision to which physical link to use in the team.  This problem is sometimes called ""link polarization""."

However, only the machine that is sending data will make use of all four links. For example, if I'm copying data from machine A to machine B then machine A will have activity on all four links while machine B has activity on only one of its links.   This makes it sound like all of your ports are not assigned to different VLANs, or you're sending to an IP assigned to one of the NIC ports instead of the bond0 IP on the receiving server.  I've never tried something like this or seen it done before, so that's the limit of my knowledge / advice."

The beauty of the Synology is that it has add on apps for most of the stuff you have identified that you want to run as docks.  They run fast and stable on my Synology.  Been doing it exactly as described for years on mine.  Stuff you pointed out you wanted could run from Synology device via quick and easy app installs from the web interface GUI (Or as a VM running on your ESXi host too): Sickbeard, VPN, DNS, owncloud, rsync backups (And amazon glacier backups for cheap offsite backups, no need for Crashplan.  Amazon is 86 cents per month for me to send 200 gigs to them) FTP/SFTP, Print Server, and it will run as a Plex server if you get Synology NAS with an x86 processor.  Mine has an ARM CPU, so it will not run Plex because it doesn't have enough horsepower to transcode video on the fly.  I run an ubuntu server VM with Plex installed onto it for this. As you can see, most everything you want can be run from a Synology.  I have a cheap, older 2 drive model and it puts in work at my house, but handles everything I toss at it.

I would personally separate the RAID into a proper NAS, but that's up to you. FreeNAS works, and I am EXTREMELY happy with my Seagate NasPro, managed to push the full 2Gbit through the NICs uploading data to my WD reds.  http://i.imgur.com/RPCt6oB.jpg  For hardware failure, honestly, HDD failure is the only prominent concern. ALternatively, you can spend more of the budget and put a secondary box in lockstep with the primary if you are worried about non HDD, hardware failure."

homelab,393et2,epaphras,3,Mon Jun 8 23:45:56 2015 UTC,"The critical thing is going to be the P2V conversion of your existing OS.  To do that, you're going to need run VMware converter and I believe that on Windows, there is no way to run it on a 'cold' hard drive.  That is, you have to run it while the OS is booted.  That means you're going to need some sort of 2nd machine to run the converter.  That machine will install an agent on the existing OS, and convert any volumes to VMDX files.  Once you have those virtualized boot drives, you should have some good options in regards to how to install VMware on your physical server.  I'd recommend installing on a usb drive or SD card so that if (when) things don't go well on the first attempt, you can always go back to booting off your raid 0.  Once you're booted off your USB drive, you should be able to format your 240GB ssds, and copy over your virtualized C drive of your windows 212 server to it and get it booting up with just its C drive.  From there, you can convert your current RAID 5 volume, and either p2v it, or just flat copy the partition onto the new 32TB volume, and the attach that virtual drive to the existing VM.  Once its all virtualized, you have lots of options when it comes to how to combine the underlying hardware.  Only thing I'll suggest is that you do not want to create a raid 5 of consumer grade sata drives that large if the data is not backed up somewhere else.  You're asking for an URE to ruin your day."

EDIT: you mentioned PCI, not PCIe - my bad. I think the same reasoning still stands though. You mentioned that you saw a card. It would be interesting to see how the power is fed.

This way you can have better uptime for your VMs for stuff like host maintenance and more CPU as well as RAM.  You could also look in the performance tab to see if your VMs actually need the RAM they are currently allocated.  It is typical for even seasoned sysads to overallocate RAM.  Look specifically at a VM's consumed, active and granted memory.  You should see active is very low.  ESXi automatically dedupes RAM, so VMs share duplicate host RAM for similar VM OS's.  This is the cheapest solution by far."

homelab,38z7f9,VexingRaven,3,Mon Jun 8 03:14:36 2015 UTC,"He could run the VMs from an Intel 750 via M.2, and then add HDD storage only when needed."
homelab,38z7f9,VexingRaven,3,Mon Jun 8 03:36:43 2015 UTC,That was the plan. Use an M.2 disk for servers with high IO and the spread the other VMs across the other two SSDs.
homelab,38z7f9,Sparkum,5,Mon Jun 8 03:42:23 2015 UTC,"Oh. You failed to mention the 1TB disks were also SSDs. I think that would've been more important than mentioning the interface type ;)  Still, what's the reason for this particular board?"
homelab,38z7f9,langfod,3,Mon Jun 8 04:45:17 2015 UTC,I chose this board as I wanted a mini-ITX system which supported a Xeon processor. It was the best I could find.
homelab,38z7f9,langfod,3,Mon Jun 8 05:19:14 2015 UTC,"I would definitely say for a ""homelab"" you are over allocating ram. In a heavily used environment sure but for what you need you could definitely remove stuff RAM from your builds. My exchange runs with 2GB (ya ya ya) pfSense (assuming nothing crazy) could easily be 512mb, if not 1GB Sharepoint, ran mine for a while (got bored with it) with 2GB SQL, depending what you do with it could probably be halved.  Completely your call, obv you'll get a higher return with more RAM, before building my whitebox and not running 40+vm's my cap was ALWAYS my ram, my CPU's were barely breaking a sweat while my RAM was capped.  I would honestly saw weigh it, do you need them all online all the time, and if so is the cost of the RAM worth it?  Obv some if you use with in homelab production need to be always on but you wouldnt necessairly need win 7, 8.1, and 10 at the same time so could turn two off to reduce ram etc."
homelab,38z7f9,canhazraid,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:15:20 2015 UTC,Good point. I could probably power down some of the VMs when they weren't explicitly needed.

homelab,38z7f9,idioteques,2,Mon Jun 8 02:43:10 2015 UTC,"The memory isn't cheap. A single 32GB Samsung DDR4 DIMM (ECC) is selling on New Egg for US$340. So the cost of stepping up from 64GB to 128GB is substantial, but I'm prepared to do it if it's necessary."
homelab,38z7f9,ixidorecu,0,Mon Jun 8 02:57:15 2015 UTC,"If that is the correct memory then it is not as bad as I was thinging.  However, I think that board will only handle 64GB unless using ECC RDIMM (registered)  My personal guess here is that you will be i/o bound to disk long before memory is an issue.  That Sys-5028d-tn4t looks like a drool worthy tiny server though."
homelab,38z7f9,PriceZombie,0,Mon Jun 8 03:10:02 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I didn't think disk would be the bottle neck. When using the SM951 with a PCIe 3.0 interface, Samsung quotes sequential read performance at 2,150MB/s and sequential writes at 1,500 MB/s. They also claim random 4KB reads can reach 90,000 IOPS with writes maxing out at 70,000. Add to this the two SATA3 drives with decent specs, do you still think disk will be the shortfall?"

You are right about power usage of the 54xx xeons, but they are also fairly slow nowadays. Each 54xx is around 3500 passmark and they use ddr2. There's a reason the xs23-ty3 c6100s are quite a bit more expensive than the xs23-cs here.  If you need a cluster with a bunch of ram and don't mind the power usage its not bad for the price, bit I personally try to stick with ddr3 based systems."

This is what ""power factor correction"" or PFC means when you're looking at power supplies.  Back in the bad old days before ubiquitous power factor correction (probably more than 15 years ago?), a power factor of 0.7 would have been more common. APC probably still uses this number when speccing their UPSes because it lets them quote higher run times for a given KVA rating. Sleazy but expected.  So for your computer, Watts = VA, no weird magic multiplier needed. Now, as to whether 45% on the bar graph equals 45% of 1500VA (UPS VA rating), or 45% of 1000W (UPS watt rating), or random% of whatever (bullshit blinky light rating), it is hard to say. But if I had to guess, I'd say percentage of the watt rating.  If you really want to know with certainty, get a Kill-a-Watt or a decent clamp meter.  (Note also that all these measurements are watts (W) not watt-hours (WH). To get watt-hours, multiply watts times the number of hours you use the equipment. For example, to compute monthly energy usage, take 450W * 24hr * 30 days = 324,000 watt-hours, or 324 kWH. In other words, if you use 450W 24/7, your monthly electricity bill will increase by 324 kWH.)"

A built-up electric field resists the change of voltage on the element, while a magnetic field resists the change of current. The notion of reactance is similar to electrical resistance, but they differ in several respects.  An ideal resistor has zero reactance, whereas ideal inductors and capacitors have zero resistance – that is, respond to current only by reactance. The magnitude of the reactance of an inductor rises in proportion to a rise in frequency, while the magnitude of the reactance of a capacitor decreases in proportion to a rise in frequency (or increases in proportion to wavelength). As frequency goes up, inductive reactance goes up and capacitative reactance goes down.

Most of those boards max out at 8GB SODIMM ram and have 2 onboard nics, 6 SATA. Etc.

Quad gig-e and 1-2 PCIe. IPMI. Definitely beefy enough to do more than just virtualize a few firewalls for a home lab. The super micro ones will fit in most of their branded 1U cases as well.

I get about 5-6 VMs on each volume pictured.  I present my shared storage to the SQL cluster nodes via iSCSI. That iSCSI LUN, like everything else, is via Storage Spaces, and utilizes the built in iSCSI feature. Didn't want to spin up a freeNAS VM just for the cluster.  I get an MSDN license via work, which comes with $100/mo Azure credit so I want to eventually play with some hybrid deployment items.   Unlike a lot of others here I use my lab for work specific educational purposes. Where I work, we're not always on the latest and greatest so I mirror my production environments with newer technologies so I can learn about them and be prepared to upgrade at work eventually.   I have a few more things I want to setup before pushing into Azure. WSUS on the mgmt server, SCCM and/or SCOM, IIS server, etc.  The management server periodically updates my No-IP pro account which is the NS for my personal web address I have registered via Google Domains. I use this functionality if I'm in an interview, I always mention my lab which always get some interest so I invite them to grab a laptop and I offer to show them. Instead of remembering my public IP which may or may not change I just remember my domain name and RDPing into that dumps you right into the management server and from there I have an mRemoteNG setup to get to the other lab servers, but not the host."

All of my OS vhds are on these hybrid type drives and any big I/O products like SQL and SharePoint have a second VHD which is housed directly on the 500GB SSD.   With the write back caching function of the storage spaces I end up getting pretty solid performance on each VM as long as I don't do a large operation like a 10GB file copy.

I love the HE series because they put out less heat and eat up less power and at $11 each you can't beat that. that is literally 22 bucks per machine to literally DOUBLE your core count! So to upgrade all of the DL365s you have would only cost you $66 bucks! I also like the HE because it runs cooler so it could cut down on how loud your machines are.   http://www.ebay.com/itm/OS2346PAL4BGH-AMD-Third-Gen-Opteron-2346-HE-1-8GHz-2MB-1600MHz-Socket-Fr2-Proces-/151681534094?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item2350ec888e  OR if you don't want to get HE and pay a bit more on your power bill but have higher more Hz get this guy!  http://www.ebay.com/itm/OS2356WAL4BGH-AMD-Third-Gen-Opteron-2356-2-3GHz-2MB-/351411547259?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item51d1c2ac7b  That would only cost you 47.94 to upgrade to quad cores on all your machines! In the end it is your call but personally I would do it especially at that price!   Sadly with the Quads you are not going to reach 2.6Ghz but that extra 300Mhz is worth losing for double the core count. At least in my opinion.

The heatsinks on these machines do not have fans, due to the height limitations of a 1u case.   If noise is a concern, rack servers are not for you.

As for if you move to a new case you will need new Heatsinks with those you REALLY need a fan blowing past it you will need new ones for sure. You will need to figure out what version of 771 cooler it takes. 771 had 2 versions one was super specific to ONLY 771 and the other was the same as 775's cooler. If it is the 775 style you are in the clear and can have nice desktop style quiet coolers. If it is the 771 you could get this  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16816101288&nm_mc=KNC-GoogleAdwords-PC&cm_mmc=KNC-GoogleAdwords-PC-_-pla-_-Server+Accessories-_-N82E16816101288&gclid=CNmGwI3f-8UCFVCVfgod8LcAww&gclsrc=aw.ds  It looks like a desktop style has many heat pipes and With it you MIGHT just MIGHT be able to get away with installing a lower RPM/Db fan on it and doing that as long as you have decent cooling in the case it's self. But in it's current state it is only 24Db so it would be a MASSIVE improvement from that 1U. But be warned it is a 4U cooler so you will HAVE to go with a 4U case not a 3U case.  OH side note you MIGHT need mounting plates depends on how that server did it's cooling so keep that in mind. Also with the new config the RAM will not have direct cooling so you might want to pick up a RAM cooler like one of the Gaming style ones just so your RAM doesn't cook it's self.  With mobo style I would go with EATX reason is most EATX cases have ATX points also it is better to over estimate than to underestimate. And even if it is ATX you will have more room for cooling, expansion and Cable management."

I've seen the Crucial MX100 and MX200 floating around $140 for 256GB and ~$180 for 512GB. You could build a sick lab for maybe $500 if you are able to score a cheaper motherboard.

You might want to setup resource groups for groups of 10 VM's as an aggregate safety net. I'd script the VM creation/imaging so you can quickly wipe/replace VM's if needed.  You'll safe a bunch of time if you can have admins who can rebuild broken student VM's. Watch out for students taking their neighbor's IP address (kids will be kids).  In a perfect world I'd setup a DHCP server with reservations for each MAC address, and monitor the mac address at each IP.  Shutdown any VM that isnt running on its correct IP.   I would suggest you have two servers if at all possible and split the load.  Inevitably SOMETHING happens and will take down a server.  Another approach would be to just use DigitalOcean.

homelab,38pwx7,bahwhateverr,3,Sat Jun 6 04:17:44 2015 UTC,"No, dynamic memory changes the amount of memory allocated to the VM in real time, based in part on feedback from the VM itself. ESXi and Hyper-V differ greatly in their approach to this, both have their benefits and drawbacks of course."
homelab,38pwx7,canhazraid,3,Fri Jun 5 21:59:25 2015 UTC,What are the advantages of Dynamic Memory/hot-add ram.
homelab,38pwx7,bahwhateverr,3,Fri Jun 5 23:08:16 2015 UTC,"It lets you really make the most of your hosts ram. The guests are (via hyper-v integration services) constantly communicating to hyper-v their memory demand. There is a continuous cycle of ""I have memory to spare, would you like some?"" and ""I'm short on memory, can you spare some?"". You can of course tweak each VMs settings, making some more higher priority or changing the buffer. Overall you get VMs that are never really starved for memory, they take what they need, spike up if needed, drop back down when not needed. The only exception so far are VMs running SQL engines. Postgresql, ElasticSearch, etc. will go a little crazy on usage."
homelab,38pwx7,canhazraid,4,Sat Jun 6 00:47:35 2015 UTC,"It lets you really make the most of your hosts ram.    Same as VMware.   The guests are (via hyper-v integration services) constantly communicating to hyper-v their memory demand.   VMware does the same -- though in a ""glass half full"" way.   There is a continuous cycle of ""I have memory to spare, would you like some?"" and ""I'm short on memory, can you spare some?"".   VMware does the same, but rather than hotadd-remove, it just balloons when needed, and doesnt rely on the VM having ram added/removed.   Overall you get VMs that are never really starved for memory, they take what they need, spike up if needed, drop back down when not needed   This doesn't seem functionally different than VMware.  VMware - Ram is not in use, hypervisor doesnt allocate it to physical memory.  HyperV - Ram is not in use, hypervisor removes it from VM, doesnt allocate it to physical memory.  VMware - Ram is in use, allocates it to physical ram.  HyperV - Ram is in use, it is hot-added, allocated to physical ram.  VMware - System is low on ram, VM's are ballooned to reduce unneeded memory from caches.  Overcommit can be swapped to disk  HyperV - Can't overcommit ram.  Seems like VMware's memory management matches or supersedes the dynamic memory functionality.   I don't see the benefit specifically of hot-add except to limit VM caching.  In VMware, VM's can run faster and cache more if there is free ram.  In HyperV they cannot.  Under load, VMware balloons the VM's and can't cache.  HyperV limits the ram and can't cache.  Am I missing an advantage of the hot-add approach?"

That's a ton of vCPUs for 16 physical cores.  Not to mention the IOPs required.  You're going to run into a bottle neck and it'll most likely be disk IO, followed by CPU timeshare and then network since you haven't even defined that.   What are these machines going to be doing?  Are they all going to be accessed at the same time?"
homelab,38pwx7,Catsrules,3,Sat Jun 6 02:01:21 2015 UTC,Would it help the IO if he runs off a few SSD drives? Say 4 SSD running 24 VMs Each?.   I am hoping your are using the terminal version of Ubuntu. The GUI version will add a ton more overhead.
homelab,38pwx7,LHD21,1 point,Sat Jun 6 06:26:24 2015 UTC,"That all depends.  If he had one of those Dell C2100s that's two beefy Xeon CPUs, a good chunk of memory and either twelve 3.5"" or twenty four 2.5"" drives, he might be ok. The key is to spread this out of the maximum number of drives.    Assuming he need 100 VMs, and ran 50 at a time.  He could break his storage up into 5 LUNs/disk pools with 10 VMs running in each LUN/disk pool.  If his LUNs/disk pools are fully inclusive of drives he'd end up with four LUNs/disk pools with 5 drives each and one with four drives (C2100 with 2.5"" drives).  If we're talking enterprise grade drives here, it shouldn't be too bad.  He's still probably going to see his IO latency rise above what I consider the ideal 20-25ms high water mark but these aren't production boxes, they're lab stations.   If he's packed the machine with SSDs they reduce latency (no seek) and are generally quick on read/write if you're taking care of TRIM.  They're still not going to get around bus bottlenecks like maximum transfer speed. A few SSDs (you suggested 4) sounds like a recipe for 2-4 second disk IO latency which is nearing unusable."

Any way he can reduce IOPs is going to work in his favor.    Of course, by PXE booting you're not really reducing IOPs, you're just moving them up in the chain.  He's still got to read from disk to provide the PXE environments with the data needed to boot.  He can do that over as long as he needs to boot all the environments up and then the administration will be much less taxed by IOPs.  He's still going to run into vCPU/pCPU and network bottlenecks though."

It should result in a performance decrease as data has to be copied from disk to memory, to the memory space of a second VM, and then used by the second VM.  It may also result in more IOPS hitting the disk if the filer is inefficient at servicing IO requests as apposed to a VM hitting disk directly.  Edit: Ah -- the proposal is to run a small VM entirely in 1GB of memory.  As the requests wouldn't hit disk (in memory) it would reduce IOPS at the expense of data persistance."

homelab,38pc61,pizzatoppings88,9,Fri Jun 5 18:41:02 2015 UTC,"So far everybody here is missing the mark so let me try...   While setting up a virtual network, Hyper-V changes the entire network behavior of the host physical server. Instead of directly using the physical network card for network connections, all network connections become set to go through a new virtual network adapter FIRST, then a virtual switch, and THEN the original physical network adapter. That's why when the virtual network is created, the physical network adapter loses its IP to the virtual adapter.   So far you're on track, but you're missing a key point here: The host OS itself is a VM, so it's the virtual network adapter to the ""host"" VM that gets the IP that was previously on the physical adapter.   If so, does the physical network adapter ever need an ip?   No, it doesn't. In fact, you can't give it one. I mean, you could try, but you'd break stuff. Check out the adapter settings for the physical adapter and you'll see why (IPv4 is disabled).   How can I ensure that the physical server and all vms have external internet access?   All you need for this is to set the vSwitch to ""External"" mode, which will connect the vSwitch to the physical adapter (which will occur as stated in the first quote).   Also, how can I ensure that the physical server and all vms have access to each other (for example, can I have all the vms be able to use the physical host as a dns server?).   When you connect them to the same vSwitch, they're already connected to each other. As the name implies, a Virtual Switch is just like plugging physical computers into a physical switch. Everything can talk to everything else.  I think you're overthinking it. Just imagine it all as a big rack, except virtual. Switches connect computers, your physical adapter is like an uplink to another switch (vSwitch to physical switch). It all becomes quite simple once you realize that the same exact concepts apply, except the lack of actual hardware. That said, you've got the right idea: Just set up and try it out, you'll get the hang of it.  EDIT: Here's a diagram I threw together that may or may not help explain it: http://i.imgur.com/nR2kGSh.png"
homelab,38pc61,VexingRaven,-4,Sat Jun 6 00:28:16 2015 UTC,The host OS itself is a VM   I'm going to have to disagree with that.
homelab,38pc61,sundsta,9,Sat Jun 6 09:21:09 2015 UTC,"You can disagree if you want but that doesn't make it untrue. Hyper-V is a type-1 hypervisor and MUST run directly on hardware. It can't do that if Windows is running on hardware. Instead, it inserts itself as the new kernel and the existing Windows installation runs as a VM with extremely low-level hardware access.  You can see this is true by adding the Hyper-V role to a Windows 8 computer that doesn't have vt-d, and then try running a game. You won't get very far because without vt-d you don't have direct access to the graphics card.  Or you could, just... you know... Go read the Microsoft docs on it."
homelab,38pc61,VexingRaven,4,Sat Jun 6 17:18:38 2015 UTC,When Hyper-V is installed the host OS sits a top of the hypervisor (hyper-v). A lot of people think enabling Hyper-V just adds some virtualization features but actually changes a significant amount of how the system works. There was a cool graph about this few days ago somewhere around this sub.
homelab,38pc61,shifto,2,Sat Jun 6 15:49:52 2015 UTC,"I'm experimenting with Hyper-V as well and have two VMs running on my Hyper-V 2012 R2 host, so I'm definitely not experienced but think I have an OK understanding of the virtual switching. The only difference is that my host is running the baremetal hypervisor version (more akin to ESXi, just a simple network managed OS solely for virtualisation) whereas I gather yours is a full Server 2008 R2 machine running Hyper-V as a role. Is that correct?   My tentative plan for tonight:  -Set the virtual network to have a static ip, using my home router as the default gateway and dns  -Set the physical network adapter to not have an ip, not have a default gateway, and not have dns  -Verify that the vms can use the host physical server as a dns server  -Verify that all servers, physical and virtual, have external internet access  -Verify that all servers, physical and virtual, are able to communicate with each other (pings, telnet for specific services like 1433)   So when you say ""set the virtual network to have a static IP"" and ""set the physical adapter to not have an IP"", what do you mean? How would you go about setting a static IP for the virtual switch independent of the physical NIC? When you say ""to not have an IP"" do you mean set it to DHCP or disable it? I think that if you disable the physical NIC, the virtual switch won't work for external access. If my understanding is correct, when you create an ""External"" virtual switch (one which can access the network outside the host, as darkkmello says), it effectively uses the physical NIC as an uplink port. That means the configuration you set for the physical NIC will define the IP etc. of the virtual switch on your physical network (what your Hyper-V host is connected to)."
homelab,38pc61,ThePegasi,-1,Fri Jun 5 20:56:23 2015 UTC,"yours is a full Server 2008 R2 machine running Hyper-V as a role  Yup  How would you go about setting a static IP for the virtual switch independent of the physical NIC?  This is actually done automatically. When you create a virtual network Hyper-V automatically removes the IP from your physical adapter and places it onto the new virtual network adapter  When you say ""to not have an IP"" do you mean set it to DHCP or disable it  I mean that I'm going to do nothing and see if everything works like I want it to. The physical network adapter loses its IP when you create a virtual network. Not really sure right now if that's bad or not actually  I think that if you disable the physical NIC, the virtual switch won't work for external access.  I'm not going to be disabling it. When you create a virtual network, the physical NIC loses its IP but gains the ""Microsoft Virtual Network Switch Protocol""; I think at this point the physical NIC starts acting like a switch for...routing traffic between virtual NICs and itself? Not sure at this point actually but I'm definitely not disabling it  That means the configuration you set for the physical NIC will define the IP etc. of the virtual switch on your physical network  This is exactly the info I was looking for. So...when the virtual switch gains the IP of the original physical NIC, should I set a new IP for the physical NIC? What if I don't? What do I gain or lose? I'm having trouble visualizing the route of traffic even with the Microsoft diagrams  More info"
homelab,38pc61,ThePegasi,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:14:13 2015 UTC,"OK, so it seems like it works differently when using Hyper-V as a role then. On my bare metal install, configuring the physical NIC is the same as always and serves as the basic network connection for the host OS. I've just checked  in the network settings on my host and there's still only one adapter listed, but it is called a virtual switch adapter so it seems as if it's been renamed at least. Therefore, in terms of the configuration options I have available, there's no distinction between the physical NIC and the uplink port of the virtual switch.  I suspect your original plan is actually correct. If the initial setup removes the IP from the physical NIC and moves configuration to the virtual switch, that seems like the way it should ideally function and you should no longer need to mess with the physical NIC to achieve the basic setup you're talking about.  EDIT: After reading the post by /u/VexingRaven, I think I understand this more. If so, the reason I can only see one network adapter for my host, and it's called virtual, is because that's exactly what it is. The physical NIC has been removed from the equation and serves only as the uplink for the virtual switch, my host OS no longer has direct access to it as a network device. Instead, the host is served a virtual port on the virtual switch, just like the VMs it's running."
homelab,38pc61,darkkmello,1 point,Sat Jun 6 10:10:15 2015 UTC,When creating a virtual nic i hv you have 3 choices  External - the vm acts like another physical pc on the network  Internal - only vms on the same internal network can communicate but cannot communicate with the external network.  Private - isolated network
homelab,38pc61,tapwater86,0,Fri Jun 5 19:17:51 2015 UTC,"The physical network adapter will need an IP still. It acts as a bridge between your virtual networks set as ""external"" and your home network. It can be static or DHCP. When you create a new virtual network and set it as ""External"" your physical NIC will then show as ""bridged"" and the NIC Hyper-V creates (the one with the name of the new virtual switch you created) is where you modify your physical server's IP and such.  If you do what you're proposing above none of your VMs will have access outside of the physical host.  What you should do is: Before creating any virtual networks set your physical server with a static IP Create a new virtual network, call it whatever, set it up as external From here your VMs will pick up a DHCP address from your home router, or you can statically assign them IPs as you would any physical PC in your home network."
homelab,38pc61,VexingRaven,2,Fri Jun 5 21:36:56 2015 UTC,"This is totally wrong. The physical adapter does not need an IP, in fact it cannot have an IP because IPv4 is disabled. The physical adapter has everything except Hyper-V Extensible Virtual Switch disabled, and the IP address and all other functionality transfers to the virtual network adapter assigned to the host.  You can do whatever you want to the ""host"" virtual adapter, and it won't affect the VMs at all because the traffic all goes through the vSwitch to the physical adapter. You could even totally disable IP on the host's virtual network adapter and you'd still get network access on the VMs."
homelab,38pc61,pcronin,0,Sat Jun 6 00:37:01 2015 UTC,"It is recommended (by me, and how I happen to have it set up) to have 1 NIC for the host, and 1 for the VNS. This way, if things go sideways with the HV, you can always RDP to main host.   In Control Panel/Network/Connections (adapter settings) I see ethernet, ethernet 2, and vEthernet(New Virtual Switch). ""Ethernet"" shows blank when you look at IPv4 details, and as /u/VexingRaven says, the only thing ""checked"" under properties tab is Hyper-V Extensible Virtual Switch. Ethernet 2 is my ""management"" NIC, and has a static IP of .9 on my subnet, with manual gateway/dns config set. vEthernet has a DHCP assigned IP, unique from any guests/VM it is hosing.   When I created ""New Virtual Switch"", I used external network type, and chose connection 1 of my dual port NIC.  I currently have ""Allow management OS to share"" enabled, so the DHCP IP could be used to RDP or RMGT to the ""host"" OS. (just tried it, worked)  The ""physical adaptor"" (Ethernet 1) sort of ""goes away"", as it no longer has any kind of networking applied directly to it, it now all goes through Hyper-V. Therefore you have already succeeded in ""set physical NIC to not have IP"" :)  I haven't tried setting a static on the vEthernet, but I don't see why one couldn't. If I open the properties of that adapter, I do get the option of setting static IPv4.   I'm not sure how using the host as a DNS will work out while using the Hyper-V switch. It should ""technically"" be possible, but I would think best practice would be to have a separate NIC for that."

homelab,38owcs,JasonDJ,24,Fri Jun 5 17:04:45 2015 UTC,"Bulk storage is expensive. And loud, and power hungry (for platter disks, at least).   Storing the data yourself is none of these.  If this is your reason for wanting ""cloud storage"" you need to rethink your strategy here.  Loud and power hungry?  A modern drive is nearly completely silent.  Power usage is minimal.  A 3Tb 7200rpm drive idles around 6 watts and maxes out at 10 watts under load.  That is a very tiny amount of power and heat to deal with.  Cost is also cheaper.  You said you've got 1.5Tb of data right now.  This is a very small amount.  You also have a requirement of accessing this data like it were a normal disk.  So let's say you purchase 2x 3Tb drives to run in a RAID1.  You spend $240 total and you've doubled your storage space.  You're now done.  You can access these drives as much and as often as you want.  There are some programs that let you access Amazon S3 storage buckets and use them like mounted disks, so here's an example doing that.  Having 1.5Tb of data sitting in S3 will cost you $45/mo.  This is without any data transfer.  They charge you per Gb for data going out.  Say you decided to read back that entire 1.5Tb over the course of a month?  $134 of data transfer fees.  Your other option would be getting a really cheap VM at some provider, running a VPN endpoint on it and iSCSI/NFS/SMB/whatever you want and attaching it to storage at the cloud provider.  Now you're paying for and maintaining another server, still paying for storage and data transfer every month, and stuck with high latency storage which you're accessing over your residential internet connection.  tl;dr?  You have such a small amount of storage you don't need a great big expensive array.  Just get a couple drives and be done with it.  If you're budget constrained I can't imagine why you'd even considering paying monthly to store data."

Then my focus shifted to self hosted applications for things I use, or could use, often. Originally I created a LAMP server, through WordPress on it and applied a Knowledge Base theme and that was my Wiki. It was attractive and responsive, but god awful slow and I didn't like the way you had to manage it. I finally replaced it (just last night) with NotePlex and I couldn't be happier. I also setup Observium, a Request Router server (not really sure what else to call it but it serves as a proxy for all incoming HTTP requests on port 80 and proxies the requested site back to the user based on the domain used, allowing me to host multiple sites on a different servers all on port 80), a development sandbox, a database server (I then moved the databases for all of my servers/applications onto this instead of having them all on the localhost of each box) and a dashboard (a LAMP server with a simple webpage that I've been slowing building into a little portal/information display for my network).  I ended up replacing the Plex/Emby servers with a bare metal media server that I acquired. It handles all of my media distribution and aquisition now.

They're too gorram big and heavy to make it economically feasible to ship them, so you pretty much have to stay local if you want one cheap. Craigslist is the best source, at least around here, but also check with electronics recycling companies. Most colleges and some government entities also have a surplus page in which they sell extra equipment - that's a good thing to keep an eye on for all kinds of furniture and commercial-grade equipment.  Also keep an eye out for any sort of business that's closing down, moving to a new location, or anything else that might hint at them selling or replacing assets.

homelab,38ofa2,davestyle,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:36:43 2015 UTC,"I ran XenServer 6.5 briefly when trying to get SR-IOV working. It was insanely fast from the VMs perspective. Prior to running it I had never seen a Linux VM reboot in under 2 seconds. But, in my experience it was very sensitive to losing its datastore. I was using iSCSI for backing all the VMs and if that device went missing there would be corruption everywhere. At the time I was having issues with stability and so I had to abandon it. If you have a stable storage device I see no reason not to use it."
homelab,38ofa2,bahwhateverr,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:15:54 2015 UTC,If you have any Linux experience or want to learn Linux I would recommend XenServer.  Even though you can do 95% from the GUI it helps to know what's going on from the command line and is very helpful troubleshooting.  If you need something up quickly and prefer GUI I would go ESXI.  But like /u/VexingRaven mentioned just try both since that's the benefit of having a lab.    Just a note too.  If those are the only services you want to run you could probably get away with installing right on the physical box instead of running VMs and isolating each service out.  If you really wanted some isolation I believe they have been developing docker containers for a lot of those as well.

homelab,38nfpn,mhurron,2,Fri Jun 5 12:18:51 2015 UTC,"Killing hardware comes from using it. Your 'designing for near 24/7 usage"" is the hardware is made to be able to handle operating temperatures and higher  (and for spinning disk to actually rotate those platters) for very long periods of time. Shutting it down lets the temperature fall and the motors stop. Wear of the devices stop.   Turning it off is not going to kill it. Long running hardware that dies after a reboot didn't die because of the reboot, it died because it was old.   ""power saving"" ... seems like more trouble than its worth    How is it trouble, it spins the disks down when it's not being used and spins it up when needed, it happens automatically."
homelab,38nfpn,VexingRaven,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:26:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for elaborating.   The below sources I've read over the past few months seem to think that disks die on startup:   http://forums.anandtech.com/showthread.php?t=2184889 http://serverfault.com/questions/29358/whats-the-effect-of-standby-spindown-mode-on-modern-hard-drives www.networkworld.com/news/2007/022607-google-disk-drives.html   It seems looking into it, that the trend seems to be disks dying on spin-up due to the stress on the motor of getting the platters moving from a stationary stop. Heat doesn't seem to have much impact on drive life, with a lot of sources recommend keeping the drives spinning if frequent reads/writes are happening.  Sure enough every disk I have had has failed on spin-up. Possibly (probably) a result of old age, but the disk is working pre-reboot, I can only assume the reboot itself and the power cycle of the drive is what finally killed it.."
homelab,38nfpn,ScottieNiven,3,Fri Jun 5 12:34:36 2015 UTC,"There is less stress to keep a drive spinning than to spin it up.  Old hard drives fail on spin-up because that's more stress than they can take anymore.  If you magically knew that the hdd couldn't take another spin-up, you could keep it alive longer (basically on life support) by not spinning it down... but it would eventually fail anyways.  Which accumulates more wear, though: spinning 24/7, or spin up, spin for a few hours, and spin down, followed by hours of it being off?  That would depend on your usage patterns.  I haven't heard of a study on what would maximize hdd life.  Businesses run equipment 24/7, but they're also in use 24/7 (people still hit websites while the employees are asleep, for example).  Is my laptop hdd going to die prematurely because I power it down every day after work?  Not likely."

Word of warning on proxmox tho, if you wish to test something like puppet to orchestrate VM deployments, proxmox does not use libvirt and insists of using netcat-traditional instead of netcat-openbsd or netcat6, meaning it will break deps and derp everything. I saw that they implemented a fix in the pve-test brancj where its using netcat6 now, to prevent stuff like this from being an issue. But for mainline proxmox it wont work unless you stick to using their API via puppet, there's modules available for it as well.  As for openvz and zfs, i have yet to see any issues. I am using the pve-test branch and 3.10-kernel tho, so likely seeing improvements not available in mainline. Not sure.

Also you will notice the signal on the 5V line for the GPIO sucks a whole lot less dirty donkey dong.  Even if you don't do that, atlaest throw a 1000uF cap on it. Massive improvement. Also if you don't go with suggestion above, consider over volting it to 5.5v. Don't do with the suggestion above thought as you will basically be running the caps at limit.

homelab,38imth,Cookieslapper,39,Thu Jun 4 13:44:28 2015 UTC,"Welcome to /r/homelab! I'll try to give you a basic understanding.  VMs are great because they provide a way for you to fully utilize server hardware by running multiple computer instances on a single server chassis. They allow you to maintain many different environments while offering you the power savings of running a single chassis. Servers are designed to run at high workloads for long periods of time (months or even years). It just makes good sense to maximize the resources available to you by divvying them across multiple VMs.  First you'll need a hypervisor, which is the OS that you'll install directly on the server itself. For free, your best option is ESXi, from VMWare. Another free option is VirtualBox, but you'll have to run that on an existing OS (like Windows 7), which will limit that amount of CPU and RAM you can devote to your VMs due to the overhead of Windows 7. If you install ESXi, you'll need to install the VSphere client on a computer within your home network and connect to your server with that. The VSphere client will allow you to create virtual machines on your ESXi server and divvy up resources between them. There are a ton of tutorials on this, so I won't bombard you with too much information.  How do you connect to your VMs? You can connect to them via the console on the VSphere client or, if you configure them properly, you can remote to your virtual machines via SSH or RDP, depending on the OS.  What kind of VMs would you want to run? I personally have run Minecraft servers, Starbound servers, SolarWinds network monitoring servers, and a Windows domain controller. At work I'm running VMs for data processing and software testing. The reason VMs are so good for software testing is because you can create a snapshot of a VM before you make a major change, make that major change, and then roll the VM back to its previous state once you've gathered the data you need. That makes it considerably easier to test a multitude of changes in a consistent environment.  If you've got the hardware, you've got nothing to lose! ESXi and Virtualbox are both free, so give either of them a shot. Remember, Google is your friend. :)"

Classification of article  Hypervisor:       In their 1974 article ""Formal Requirements for Virtualizable Third Generation Architectures"" Gerald J. Popek and Robert P. Goldberg classified two types of hypervisor:   Type-1: native or bare-metal hypervisors   These hypervisors run directly on the host's hardware to control the hardware and to manage guest operating systems. For this reason, they are sometimes called bare metal hypervisors. A guest operating system runs as a process on the host. The first hypervisors, which IBM developed in the 1960s, were native hypervisors. [citation needed] These included the test software SIMMON and the CP/CMS operating system (the predecessor of IBM's z/VM). Modern equivalents include Oracle VM Server for SPARC, Oracle VM Server for x86, the Citrix XenServer, VMware ESX/ESXi and Microsoft Hyper-V 2008/2012.

homelab,38imth,timawesomeness,12,Thu Jun 4 20:08:36 2015 UTC,"I think you need to clarify some basic concepts:  A virtual machine is exactly the same as a normal computer (a CPU, RAM memory, hard drivers, network cards, etc...) but instead of built with real componentes in the real world, those virtual machines are built of software that runs inside a ""Hypervisor"" that is what really runs on real hardware.  The Hypervisor is the real operating system that runs on a real computer (a server most likely) The hypervisor is capable of present different pieces of resources of the real computer/server to it's different virtual machines at the same time, so you can run several ""computers"" inside a big real computer. For example: Your real computer/server have 8 gb of RAM memory. The hypervisor itself consumes 1/2 gb, so you have 7,5 gb left for the virtual machines. Your computer/server then could run 4 machines simultaneously, 3 of each with 2 gb of ram and one with 1,5 gb of ram, consuming all your 8 real gb of ram. The same goes with the cpu, hard drive, etc...  This is a very simple basic and non-exactly real explanation, it goes deeper than that, but it is just an introduction to vm's.  What you can do with those vm's is all about what you need or want to do. You can have a real enterprise scenario with windows server with your own domain, mail server, file server, web server, clients..., you can test operating systems like ""this new distro of linux rocks, you should totally try it"", or ""what about this new windows 10? i readed some articles, but i want my own opinion without having a physical dedicated machine"". The options are almost endless, what you want is almost up to you."
homelab,38imth,Gotxi,6,Thu Jun 4 19:37:16 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen it mentioned yet, so I'll jump in:  You get a squeaky clean environment supplied to the VM. You get snapshots to easily roll back any changes - this is awesome both in production and in a lab. You can migrate VMs between hardware.  If your VM outgrows your server, just migrate it to a larger server and give it more resources.  Your downtime can be between minutes and none, depending on the technology you use. Same deal with storage - if you want/need your VMs on faster storage, no problem.  Shut down the VM, move the VHD file to your shiny new SSD array, turn it back on.  Tada."
homelab,38imth,eggrian,3,Thu Jun 4 19:49:02 2015 UTC,That's a great point—you can migrate VMs between hosts without having to worry about driver conflicts. That makes scalability a lot easier.

My PBX controller is still XP, too hard and expensive to migrate.  VM.  My door control software was designed for Win9x...machine it was on was a workstation and was dying.  Disk2VHD FTW, now a VM.  Some legacy software we rely on for day to day operations didn't run on Win7 64bit, and was only supported on XP.

homelab,38imth,eggrian,3,Thu Jun 4 14:37:46 2015 UTC,"Depends on what platform you're using. ESXi is pretty limited with what you can do directly on the host with a keyboard - basically just enough to setup remote access (adding a name, IP address, etc). ESXi makes heavy use of the vSphere client or their web client to actually manage the server and virtual machines.  Hyper-V (Microsoft) can operate like a normal server, with a full Windows desktop at the console.  In terms of managing the operating system of the VM, you can either manage via the hypervisor client (vSphere or Hyper-V), or connect directly to the server (remote desktop, SSH, etc.)"

homelab,38imth,bigredone15,4,Thu Jun 4 18:37:28 2015 UTC,"It is all about separation of duties.  Let's say you want to do 5 things with your server:  Email  Website  Host Minecraft  School Work  Play Games  You could do these all on one server, but you will run into cases where you want a setting one way for one, and one way for another.  Or lets say you need to take down your minecraft server to run some updates.  If you are running it all on one, you have to take down your website, email and can't do any school work until you are done.  VM's allow you to compartmentalize resources, risks and uses."
homelab,38imth,psycho202,2,Thu Jun 4 14:04:27 2015 UTC,"Yep, but you forget one massive aspect for businesses: ease of management and maintenance coupled with high availability / security in case of hardware failure.  If you have a rack filled with physical servers with 1 thing each, and you need to swap out a bad RAM stick on one server, that service is down.  With virtualisation, and having multiple virtualisation hosts (servers), you have the possibility of moving all the virtual machines on the defective server to different hosts without any downtime on those services.  Next to this, when you dedicate 1 server to 1 service, and you need to add a new service or need to upgrade the server for one service, you're suddenly stuck waiting a couple days to a couple weeks (depending on manufacturer and level of customisation) before you can deploy that new service or perform the upgrade.   Add virtualisation to the picture. Now you just spin up a new virtual machine on the pool and off you go. Suddenly need more performance on a server? Hot-adding RAM or adding ram during a maintenance window, easy as changing a number in a configuration screen. Need more performance in a pool for growth? Order a new server, put it in the pool with the rest of the servers you already have and the management software will automatically move servers to it to balance load across all servers!"
homelab,38imth,Gotxi,3,Thu Jun 4 14:15:04 2015 UTC,"Nope, its not illogical. A game server is a service oriented software with the same huge needs as an enterprise service like a mail server.

homelab,38imth,regmaster,6,Thu Jun 4 14:36:30 2015 UTC,"It's extremely logical to run game servers on server hardware or VMs running on servers. Minecraft servers, for instance, can be very CPU-intensive when a user is flying across unrendered chunks. Server CPUs are generally better-equipped to handle that type of workload.

Yea they may have more cores and cache than a desktop equivalent but they won't be any different internally.  I think it's also worth pointing out that it's only because server grade hardware allows for such large amounts of hardware in 1 system that they allow for all that load.

Essentially, I couldn't tell you whether a server CPU or an equivalent desktop CPU would be better equipped for rendering unrendered chunks on a Minecraft server. The point I'm trying to make is that you can have far more processing capability at your disposal with a server, as you can have multiple sockets supporting chips with anywhere from 1-8 cores apiece (~x2 if hyperthreaded).  After doing some research before hitting submit on this post, I did discover that chunk rendering is limited to a single core. I guess it just boils down to how good that server or desktop CPU core is at running a Minecraft server."

The dry answer is listed below, self directed learning and for times when your employer is not going to pay to test some of your more wacky ideas and you don't want to experiment with production (for obvious reasons!).  On top of answering your question, I will include the funniest homelab story I have.  Girlfriend's family member opens a new BBQ joint in town, and while converting this restaurant space over to a BBQ joint with smokers etc he gets some quotes for POS systems to handle his credit card sales. He doesn't like the size of the quotes, and since I ""know computers"" I am requested to weigh in and help select and direct his purchase.  Fast forward to a week later and the house has become some sort of demented Panera bread. Signs are placed everywhere that for testing inventory functions everything must be ""charged"" to multiple POS systems any time food is removed from the pantry or fridge. Friends can no longer just grab beer from the fridge, they now must swipe their credit card 3 times and enter the birthday on their licenses. My girlfriend was charged multiple times when I cooked breakfast. Every ounce of food is triple audited and charged to the appropriate systems. I lost 6 pounds.  Restaurant owner people/employees are over at the house BBQing for 5 days straight as we show them the benefits and detriments of the different systems that he has requested that we consider. He tests out different possible workflow scenarios for managing his restaurant using these different POS systems.  After five days he makes a final decision, we purchase all the hardware and software, and roll it out and get it configured and ready for him to begin his data entry to make it a production system. We help out a little bit here and there, but he takes the reins and goes the extra mile to understand everything about the system.  He still uses it to this day. I'm no longer with that girlfriend, but we parted ways relatively amicably. I still get free BBQ when I visit, and I get sporadic calls to fix things when the software vendor that normally supports the system is being ridiculous.  That's the point of my favorite homelab I ever owned, free BBQ."

homelab,38lxkh,Wofolz,2,Fri Jun 5 02:01:32 2015 UTC,"Not a bad deal. You might want to spend ~$100 more and get 2 x5650. They will blow E5504 out of the water.   Can be done, but spare parts for the R710 are plentiful and cheap. Don't do it. There are two versions, the iDRAC Express and iDRAC enterprise. You need the express for the enterprise to work, but it will work without a SD card. With those drives, 2 x X5650 and 40GB of memory, my guess is around 140-160 Watt at idle. The iDRAC will report power consumption.   Good luck, the R710s are solid servers."

I did a lot of fiddling around with it and now its my main firewall... It boots off a 60GB ide laptop drive, I changed out the chip for Pentium M as the x550e is a generation newer than the x500 which uses a PIII, and bumped the RAM to 2GB  You don't have to remove the fans, there is a utility you can install that you can use to set the fan speed.   I lowered it in the BIOS a little, I but you can only lower it so much on the x550e not sure about to x500 or you have to pull the fans plugs to get it to boot again. I then use the utility after boot up to really drop it down so it's quiet.  Have you seen this doc?  It's a bit out of date, but still relevant https://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/PfSense_on_Watchguard_Firebox  The utility to managed the Arm/Disarm LED and the fans is here https://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/PfSense_on_Watchguard_Firebox#Controlling_hardware_with_WGXepc  I install WGXepc and then in the pfsense UI I install the shellcmd package which lets you run commands easily on boot.   I then execute:  /conf/WGXepc -f 0D   and the thing goes silent with the stock fans.  I also execute:  /conf/WGXepc -l green   so that the arming light turns green.

homelab,38hrb8,WDKevin,2,Thu Jun 4 12:03:40 2015 UTC,"For that cheap, I'd say yes, but grab some extra RAM. You have as many threads on that CPU as you have GB of RAM. I usually aim for a 2 to 8GB per thread, wherever possible.   It wouldn't eat THAT much power, it has a gold rated 350Watt PSU, but will most likely never eat that much power with just that one CPU. I'd guess 50 to 100 Watt actual power usage.  Keep in mind that it only has 2x 40mm fans. IIRC the stuff Supermicro shoves into their servers is quite loud by default, but does the job fine. Yay for 1U servers.  I don't know how they throttle on that specific server, nor how loud they are when throttled down.   It's a short 19"" case, so you should be able to fit it in some of the deeper audio-grade racks or maybe even a wall mount.  TL;DR yes, grab it. Add some more ram when needed, if you can get extra ram with it for cheap do it, aim for 2 to 8GB per thread so 32GB to 128GB. Power usage shouldn't be too high, but noise might be high."

To buy the right NIC's I advise you to use their compatibility tool. The SATA drivers on the MOBO could also be an issue. You can use the esxi cutomizer tool to rebuild a custom ISO with drivers rolled into it if you need to. I have done this successfully several times and would happy to go into more depth if need be.

I already had the SSDs and the PSU. I didn't intend on buying the M1015 but I didn't even think about only being able to pass through an entire SATA controller, and I need the onboard SATA for my datastores.  Virtualization Stack:   What, if any, VM management are you running on your hardware?   I'm simply running ESXi 6.0 on the trial license, but will migrate to free once the trial is over.   How many VMs can you run given the hardware in your system?   I could probably run around 20 VMs if I was stingy with RAM. CPU is fine; I don't have a lot of CPU-intensive use cases. I currently have the following VMs:   W2012R2 DC - 4 vCPUs, 4GB RAM - AD, DHCP and DNS W8.1 - 4 vCPUs, 4GB RAM - ""Terminal server"", general tool use and other apps that don't run on OS X. Also use this for vSphere to manage my ESXi host W10 Technical Preview - 4 vCPUs, 4GB RAM - For fun! Debian 7 tools server - 4 vCPUs, 4GB RAM - Various apps, don't care if it gets cluttered with stuff I don't need. Have a base OVF template that I can use to spin up a new one. Debian 7 OpenVPN server - 1 vCPU, 1GB RAM - Only use occasionally, otherwise I stop the service and disable the NAT rule on my switch FreeNAS 9.3 - 8 vCPUs, 8GB reserved RAM - ~11TB usable RAIDZ1, also running Plex server in a jail Debian 7 Splunk - 8 vCPUs, 8GB RAM - Idle most of the time, aggregates logs from my network for easy searching & troubleshooting Debian 7/8 Suricata IDS/IPS - 4 vCPUs, 4GB RAM - Haven't begun work on this yet due to needing to purchase a NIC. Don't wanna drop the money on it right now.   I think that's all of them. I'm definitely not CPU bound, but I'm thinking I'll probably have to be stingy with RAM at some point. Right now I'm fine on RAM as my servers are not using all of their allotment, with my Windows hosts using around 2-3GB each, my Debian tools server using ~1GB, Splunk server using ~5GB (it will pretty much eat up whatever you give it), FreeNAS is reserved so all 8GB are ""used"", and my Debian OpenVPN server uses about 200MB at idle. Altogether my hosts are using about ~24GB of RAM so I have some breathing room. I don't foresee myself spinning up a ton of other VMs. The only thing that might need a decent amount of RAM is a pfSense/Suricata VM.  Virtualized Networking: None aside from default vSwitch in ESXi - more to come once I purchase a NIC for pfSense/Suricata VMs  Notes:   What hardware/software combination did or did not work with your environment?   Everything worked out of the box. I did not have to inject any drivers into the ESXi 6 ISO.  I originally planned to put my GTX770 in the server and pass it through to a W8.1 VM to use as an HTPC/gaming rig in my living room. GeForce cards have hardware limitations preventing them from being passed through - this can be mitigated by hardware modding them to identify as Quadro cards; I also read KVM has some tricks to prevent the card from realizing it's in a VM. I ran W8.1 on the bare metal to see graphical performance and I found that it was very choppy while playing even a fairly undemanding game like Diablo 3. I looked closer at the specs on my motherboard and found that the PCI-E x16 slot only runs at x8. Was quite depressing, but I figure I'll just build a new gaming rig like I wanted to do anyway.  I built my ESXi host as a ""production"" server to get centralized logging with Splunk, as well as a lab environment to play with distributed environments and simplified server deployments. I also wanted to get a new NAS since the Synology can't transcode videos  to save its life, which is necessary for anything with subtitles. I also wanted more storage. I went with FreeNAS with a passed-through M1015 and now I get awesome file transfer performance as well as great transcoding performance from the jailed Plex server. I tested the crap out of the 6TB drives using badblocks (4 tests, 96 hours per test) before creating my array and putting stuff on. I encrypted my zpool and I still can get ~200MB/s writes to the array if a VM on the host is writing to it, otherwise I maxed out 1Gbps (125MB/s) writing over Ethernet from my rMBP. I'm still very leery of wiping my Synology drives, as this is my first home-grown NAS and I want to make sure it's rock solid before cutting over. I'll be selling the Synology and drives to a friend who wants a simple, easy NAS."

homelab,38e9fa,canhazraid,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:16:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the Quick reply, but just to be sure (I am on my way to build an xenserver so i am completly noob here) You are saying that ""I wouldn't give a VM more vCPU than the host has actual cores""  so if I only had one VM then i could use 8 vCPU  But what if i have two ? would i then be limited to 4 vCPU on each VM? Or could they both have 8 vCPU's?"
homelab,38e9fa,dgaa1991,3,Thu Jun 4 18:49:56 2015 UTC,"You can overcommit CPU pretty heavily, according to the best practices document linked to by /u/canhazraid below. As long as you don't have multiple VMs with 8 vCPUs all fighting for cycles, you should be fine. But apparently giving ""too many"" vCPUs to a VM can cause real physical CPU usage, due to some OSes running wait cycles during idle or something like that. The document below has it."

The only thing I saw about performance ""loss"" in your linked document was that having more vCPUs than necessary can chew up actual processing cycles on the CPU itself due to the way some OSes or apps handle idle cores, like querying for jobs or executing a wait command. And apparently ESXi actually kills these wait tasks or whatever. But ~maybe I read it wrong~"
homelab,38e9fa,meta-perspective,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:33:53 2015 UTC,"Can you really say that FreeNAS performance is being hurt by having too many vCPUs?   I cannot say I have benchmarked the OP's system.  I can say this however.  I had a VM on a host with a 10GbE link to a EMC XtremeIO (all flash) san we setup for testing.  With a single vCPU we were able to peg the 10GbE link (97% utilization) and hit 470,000 IOP's.  The performance dropped when we added two vCPU, and even more when we added four vCPU (on a dual Xeon 12 core).    I can say its VMware best practice to not provide more vCPU than needed.  Best practice from every course I've ever attended is ""dont add more vCPU than you need"".  Old versions of VMware would require that all CPU's were free to co-schedule even single threads."
homelab,38e9fa,canhazraid,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:24:30 2015 UTC,Hurt?  No it's a VM not a bunny. Will it perform worse? Yes. I manager and deploy vSphere environments for my job.  CPU overcommit causes the guest OSes to sit twiddling their thumbs until all the vCpus they need are free.  If your FreeNAS only had 2 cores then it would get scheduled much more often and wouldn't be waiting.  Analogies are rarely perfect but imagine waiting for a table for 8 to become free in a restaurant versus a couple rocking up or a single.  They would get served much more quickly.  (remember your restaurant only has 8 seats).
homelab,38e9fa,pobx,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:51:12 2015 UTC,"So here's a scenario. Splunk uses one thread per search performed. When loading dashboards, you can easily peg all cores because you're performing multiple searches at once. But let's say I'm doing a single search. Are you saying because I have the ability to run more searches in parallel, aka more threads, Splunk is going to wait until they're all free before it tries to use a single thread? I'm just not sure how to understand this issue. If the OS only needs one thread but it's got 8, why should the status of the other threads impact the performance of a single idle thread? Let's even assume HyperThreading is off and you only have 4 threads but they're all physical cores. Is the impact the same? It's sounding like you're saying that having more threads available reduces performance. But I know I don't understand this well, so forgive me. Is there another way you might be able to describe what happens and the real impact it has?  EDIT: Or are you saying that if Splunk requests 4 vCPUs and I have 8 vCPUs allocated, it's not going to do anything until it has 4 free vCPUs? If it requested 2 threads and had 4 vCPUs, it would just chug along until its job was complete? Is that more what you're saying?"
homelab,38e9fa,meta-perspective,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:10:59 2015 UTC,"I did not know this! I read the best practices doc you linked below and while it says it can eat up physical CPU usage, it doesn't say it reduces performance. Now if you were trying to use all 8 vCPUs in one VM and another VM had 8 vCPUs allocated but was at ""0% load"" you might not get the performance you're looking for on the box that's actually using them. At least that's how I interpreted the document."

homelab,38e9fa,psycho202,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:30:50 2015 UTC,"What? The E3-1230 through 1276 are all on par with the i5-4690 through the i7-4790 as far as single threaded performance is concerned. The E3 series is actually pretty popular with gamers, as it's cheaper than the i7 series by $30-50 and the only thing you don't get is an unlocked multiplier. I just read on AnandTech that the new Broadwell E3s are higher priced and geared more toward video transcoding, likely to curb gaming use. Kinda disappointing, but I guess I wasn't going to upgrade my CPU a month after getting it anyway. Plus the E3-1285L (I think) is like $440, which is like $200 more than the 1246."
homelab,38e9fa,yokken,1 point,Thu Jun 4 08:25:49 2015 UTC,"The Xeons generally have lower stock clockspeeds too. That lowers the single core performance. If you've got a decent gaming motherboard, it'll try to stay almost permanently in the turbo clockspeeds + easy overclocking for i5-i7's"
homelab,38e9fa,psycho202,2,Fri Jun 5 21:51:57 2015 UTC,"Well at least with the 1246, the clock speed is 3.5GHz. The i7-4790 is at 3.6GHz, and runs $290 on Amazon right now, with the i7-4790k running $340. The E3-1246v3 is actually more expensive on Amazon right now, at $297, but I got mine at Micro Center for $240. That's $100 cheaper than the 4790k and the performance is still pretty much on par unless you overclock the crap out of the i7, which would definitely give you a nice boost. Still, single threaded performance between these is negligible, and for the price reduction, the Xeon is a better bang for your buck.  Do you have a source for gaming motherboards keeping the processor in turbo? I'm under the impression that the CPU will turbo if it is under load, and that the Xeons and i-series will do this the same way. I mean, even with an i-series, I wouldn't want it at max clock speed unless I'm actually doing something. They will ramp up and down as demands dictate... but you are right about the overclocking, as long as you get one with an unlocked multiplier."
homelab,38e9fa,yokken,2,Sat Jun 6 09:39:14 2015 UTC,"The CPU will turbo when it's at a high single core load, turbo a bit less when it's at multi core load. Most motherboards I've worked with try to pull the multi-core turbo speeds to the same as the single-core turbo speeds.   If you don't OC your 4790K cpu, you're missing out on a nice bit of performance though. OC to 4.0ghz is just so easy to do. That's really the major point of loss between the 4790K and the 1246v3.  However, if you can grab that xeon for the price of the i5 4690K, then you've got a good deal that's totally worth it."
homelab,38e9fa,psycho202,2,Sat Jun 6 16:06:58 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see what you mean. Like the i7 might push harder for higher clocks all around. When I build a new gaming rig, I'm definitely going to be overclocking the processor. Getting 4GHz is trivial, but if you mount your cooler properly, you can get 4.5GHz out of an i5/i7 with minimal temperature increases. As far as servers go, though, I think the price/performance ratio is great with the E3 series."
homelab,38e9fa,yokken,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:34:51 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's exactly what I mean!  I just mentioned the 4Ghz because there are still a lot of people who are not that comfortable with overclocking, and 4Ghz is a really easy and almost guaranteed stable overclock for all CPUs. With the last gen core i series CPUs, 4.5Ghz isn't always possible on every CPU though. I've had a couple i7 4770K getting stuck at 4.3Ghz and 4790K's getting stuck at 4.5Ghz as last possible stable overclocks"

homelab,38e9fa,semtex87,2,Thu Jun 4 08:20:51 2015 UTC,Nice!  May I ask how you modified the fans on the PE2950? I ask because we just decommed a bunch of equipment in my office and I had free reign to take home what I wanted for personal use. So I grabbed a few PE2950III and some other stuff.  Rack mount servers are loud as crap (understandably) and I've been trying to figure out how to dampen the jet engine sound from the fans of the PE2950
homelab,38e9fa,Drathus,2,Wed Jun 3 23:32:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  You have a couple options. You can replace the fans with newer ones, you can solder a resistor onto the (+) power line, or both.  I did both. Because I'm silly.  Here are the four main fans replaced in my 2950. In order to ensure that their air did its job I had to model and 3D print some spacers to fill the missing fan depth. Lastly, because Dell doesn't want you replacing the fans, the fan connector isn't standard, so you have to cut off the plug from the stock fan and solder it onto the new fan.  In addition to those four fans, you'll want to do the same to the PSU fans, as they're the same fan and jet-engine noise situation.  For those I just soldered a resister in line on the positive, and that worked a treat. Sadly I don't have any pictures of that.  If I were doing it all over again, I'd just use the resister method on all six stock fans and be done with it. Replacing the fans was extra effort and cost that I didn't have to bother with.  Looking around one user has used a 47ohm resistor, and I went with 33ohm 1/4 watt ones.  All told my 2950 is now no more loud than my desktop PC with a graphics card, and a quick check of the drac shows it's running at 25C."

It saves me time to spin up a new VM to try a new project instead of attempting to cleanup a failed or abandoned project from another host should I decide to no use it.  Also, with KSM enabled on a Linux KVM host, ram is de-duplicated at the cost of some CPU cycles.

While not directly linked, KVM can use KSM to merge pages of Virtual machines.  This is done by scanning through the memory finding duplicate pages. The duplicate pair is then merged into a single page, and mapped into both original locations. The page is also marked as ""copy-on-write"", so the kernel will automatically separate them again should one process modify its data.   KSM was originally intended to run more virtual machines on one host by sharing memory between processes as well as virtual machines. Upon implementation, it was found to be useful for non-virtualized environments as well where memory is at a premium.   An experimental implementation of KSM by Red Hat found that 52 virtual instances of Windows XP with 1GB of memory, could run on a host computer that had only 16 GB of RAM.

So it will look like: Block (source ip: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx) to (destination ip: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx) on (port number: 22 as example...).

For OpenVPN, use it in client-certificate mode (following the pfSense directions for OpenVPN is a good idea, their way is a safe way). Require a password too, and use good passwords. Check and make sure the router/gateway you are using doesn't have built in back doors, unpatched vulnerabilities, etc. If it came from your ISP it probably does. You don't really need fancy schmancy stuff to have a good firewall, but run something like dd-wrt or pfSense if possible and just close all the ports that aren't SSH. Check that you're running WPA2 for your wireless network. Set a really good passphrase for that. If possible, stick all wireless clients on their own VLAN/subnet and only allow through traffic that needs to come through. (e.g. if you have Plex or something and you want your roomates to be able to get to it, set it up so their machines are all on another subnet and use NAT/port forwarding to open up 80/443 on the Plex server to them, instead of just sitting your servers and the wifi clients all on the same subnet.).   If you do that stuff, your network is looking pretty good. The idea is generally to separate the public things from the private things and only allow the traffic we want. For a web service, that usually means any IP address can hit the server, but only on web service ports. For SSH or VPN, sometimes this means only allowing connections from certain IPs that we know will connect. In all cases, using cryptographic artifacts (keys, certificates) is much better than passwords and does a lot to mitigate normal kinds of attacks on home networks."
homelab,38dtm6,f0nd004u,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:43:01 2015 UTC,"To add to this, running SSH on a non-default port is usually a good idea as well.  I personally like port 2222."
homelab,38dtm6,pheonix991,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:09:06 2015 UTC,"Not necessary. I have literally never seen it done that way in well-managed production environments because then you have to document what the port number is and any new user will have to be informed, applications that use ssh might not work, etc etc. It doesn't really get you anything positive in return, except cleaner logs. If you use keyauth only and disable root login, the brute forces from china can't do anything so there's no need to use a non standard port. If you need more than one inbound ssh connection, use a VPN.  You can use a non standard port if you want, it does mean cleaner logs, but if you are concerned, I would just use a VPN. Using a non standard port doesn't make you any more secure though; if you use insecure SSH config it doesn't matter what port its on. An attacker can still find it.  And port knocking and all that stuff is for paranoid folks. Fun to mess around with, but I don't think it's particularly necessary. If you really want high security, use two-factor auth with totpcgi and RADUIS or the PAM module."

That way, if your fileserver takes a crap on you, it doesn't take down the rest of your systems.   In this case, have your local ZFS setup be available for KVM machines. Make a KVM machine of whatever flavor you want, and assign it the space you want, having that space hosted on the ZFS setup. Format it as LVM for easy expansion later. Share from there.

The container would just be for sharing.

Wherever your pfSense VM ends up on your virtual infrastructure it will be able to pick up a DHCP lease from the modem, since they are the only two devices in that VLAN across your virtual and physical networks.

homelab,38anx9,Fekkii,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:39:13 2015 UTC,"Well, it was sort of sarcastic.  But the general point is: anything that allows administrative access to a server via a web interface is almost inherently a Bad Idea.  Particularly when it allows you to do things that ought to require root privileges (which almost all of the major ones do).  That purposely defeats a huge amount of security that is normally baked-in to the operating system, and is specifically designed to isolate big, high-risk/high-footprint packages like a web server from being able to escalate privileges and take over the host OS.  The fact that they are common do not mean that they are remotely a good idea.  You are better off not learning to rely on them for server administration.  Just use SSH.  Write shellscripts if you want to automate common tasks.  But using an internet-accessible web interface, almost always through Apache, to administer your server, puts a shitload of code into your security footprint.  The only way I'd ever think that web control panels are a good idea is when they're used on a dedicated network, the way some Lights Out Management systems do.  It's hard to really find much fault with that.  But typical Webmin stuff is best avoided."

homelab,38ajdx,scubastevegk,1 point,Wed Jun 3 11:07:04 2015 UTC,"I've used Pushover before and generally enjoyed it but I seem to recall it not being free forever. Is that still the case?  In fact, I wrote a webapp that never got released called MultiPush. It was a push wrapper with it's own API. Users could login, setup their Pushbullet, Pushover, Rapid Push and a couple other push API details and then they could send a single API call to the MultiPush API which would in turn push their notification out to all of the different push services they have setup. The intention was for other developers to bake the service into their apps and allow their users to receive push notifications through a variety of providers rather than be limited to the one that the applications developer chose.  The concept came from myself using an app that required I install a specific push app to get their notifications. I had already had 2 others installed and I didn't like the need to have to install all these different push apps to work with various services. So I built this tool for developers to expand their support for push notices and let their users decide on which one they want to use, eliminating the requirement to install multiple apps.  MultiPush was pretty much finished and is still up on a server somewhere, but I never polished it off and released it. It had the same fate that many of my apps/projects do."

homelab,38agl5,wuten0,6,Tue Jun 2 23:03:30 2015 UTC,"Here is a big one: electricity and noise. If you want a hypervisor that will run 5+ qemu/kvm virtual machines , I would recommend something with a half-decent amount of ram(think 8, preferably 16+ gb although for most vms something like 512mb ram is more than enough). If you are thinking about storing any type of data on your server make sure the server you get has enough storage slots or a good way to add additional storage(unless you are willing to get a dedicated nas). Besides the hypervisor idea, none of those would really require any more power than something you can get on an old cpu or even something like rasp pi(esp for your purposes). If you are seriously planning on using it as a router try to make sure it has at least two nics. Another cool thing is checking if there is out-of-band management on the server allowing you to do cool stuff like monitor power, use serial(or even kvm) over lan as well as adding a bunch of juicy logging goodness."
homelab,38agl5,b1uestarfish,2,Tue Jun 2 23:25:42 2015 UTC,"Okay so I will make sure to double check specs on RAM, max storage capacity (I can always slowly add disks if it doesn't come with much), and at least dual NICs.   Question about the out-of-band management.. Is that as important if I will always have physical access to the box? Or do you mention it just because it provides another source of information to track?  Thank you!"
homelab,38agl5,b1uestarfish,3,Tue Jun 2 23:42:54 2015 UTC,"If you have physical access, Out of band management probably wouldn't give you much that you'd find too useful. Its just a great feature because of how low level the log/access is. Most dells have this in the form of iDRAC. I dont have a dell at home but some of my favorite things about it is the capability to mount isos remotely(and boot from them) and the fact that it gives you details about hardware components(helps a lot before you do a binary search for one out of 16 bad dimms). If you are looking to learn more about working with servers in production environment then Id say try looking for one with management - nowadays its one of the defining differences between server and desktop computers. If you just want something to run your stuff at home and don't really care about learning more about the industry, then its your choice. In any case, if you get a namebrand server like a poweredge, proliant or thinkserver, chances are they already have this stuff - its really become an essential part of the industry."
homelab,38agl5,bigstrat2003,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:39:52 2015 UTC,"Even if you have physical access, out of band management is great. For example, if you need to reinstall the OS on your server for some reason, an out of band management that lets you access the console means you don't have to drag a monitor/keyboard/mouse over to the server to rebuild it, you can just manage it from your normal workstation.  YMMV on how important stuff like this is to you, but I would personally be very unlikely to consider a server without out of band management now that I've experienced the convenience of having it."

homelab,387rzn,I-baLL,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:02:52 2015 UTC,The legs have particle board stuff in the inside so it's not completely hollow but once you go past the top 2 inches it's not sufficient to mount from top to bottom. The approach I took is to stack from bottom to top that way the devices support each others weight. I put the screws in just for alignment. I used 1 inch wood screws and the brackets have at least 1 screw in solid wood  but it is very sturdy because I have the brackets on all four legs.

homelab,386a6i,tangobravoyankee,2,Tue Jun 2 11:24:39 2015 UTC,I like their azure bump. What did you present your start up as? Anything I should keep in mind in trying to get a bizspark account setup?

homelab,386a6i,tangobravoyankee,2,Tue Jun 2 13:13:24 2015 UTC,Do they send any emails to the business email address you supply during the registration/vetting? I have a domain but haven't set up emails on it yet.
homelab,386a6i,Henaree,3,Tue Jun 2 14:07:58 2015 UTC,They're going to communicate with you using the email address that you provide on the signup form. You should use an email address at your domain.  (And this is completely separate from your Microsoft account login that will be associated with your benefits)
homelab,386a6i,tangobravoyankee,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:37:13 2015 UTC,Make sure you use your company domain email as the signup and contact email. I originally signed up with my gmail and gave them the corporate email as an alternate and they denied my application and told me to reapply using the corporate/domain email.  It was approved after I made that change.

homelab,386a6i,sesstreets,9,Tue Jun 2 20:21:58 2015 UTC,"Short answer is no. There is no direct comparison. What they did was expand the range of the evaluation software they offer and slightly modify the different levels of dreamspark and msdn and a few of the rest to fill in the gaps as far as Dev and enterprise users.  Basically they see no need for home users to have full licenses for enterprise software and are pushing everyone towards the evaluation editions for learning and testing.  Its a shame for homelab users and unfortunately it looks like its not going to be reversed any time soon.  Edit: I realized it might sound like I agree with it, I fucking dont I think its fucking ridiculous and a damned shame!"
homelab,386a6i,houstonau,1 point,Tue Jun 2 11:25:11 2015 UTC,Except that isn't correct at all. You can get full licenses for Exchange/Office/Windows(client and server)/SharePoint. For about 450.00 a year (now including MSDN). And use them in production for revenue generating activities (not the MSDN licenses of course).   Microsoft Action Pack. Check it out.

I will snag a .edu email account from them and go the dreamspark route. As if I understand correctly you need to be a student for dreamspark?  As a side note is there a way to get a .edu mail from anywhere without being a student? I am going to get one soon. But I was just wondering. It's been a long time since I was at school taking courses. This should be interesting!!"
homelab,386a6i,The707kid,1 point,Tue Jun 2 05:06:31 2015 UTC,"Yea, you have to be a student. Not sure about the .edu email, those are U.S. only AFAIK (in in Canada)."
homelab,386a6i,just_insane,1 point,Tue Jun 2 11:35:20 2015 UTC,"you dont need a .edu email, its just the easiest method to get into Dreamspark.   Basically this is how it works..   register for dreamspark with a microsoft account validate your account with either   a .edu email - they send you confirmation link to the .edu email and you just need to click it proof of being a student access code obtained from someone at your school (like instructors or library)  start downloading   Once you get a key its good for 3 times and then becomes invalid and unusable. Microsoft support will not give you new keys until your 1 year validation period is up again.   the barebones dreamspark gets you most of their server level stuff, server 2012 r2 (DC, Essentials, Standard), server 2012, Server 2008, SQL Server, Visual Studio, and a few others.  Beyond that your school access code can get you more stuff like free ""Consumer"" operating systems (windows 7, 8, 8,1, 10 preview), also office, project,  visio.. and even vmware licensing (my comm college has all this).    bizspark enrollment is a joke really and gets you msdn access (i think premium, i'd have to look) + $150/mo (per person) in azure credits for 3 years, also office 365 for 1 person. I dont even have a website, i gave them my business email and a link to a github repo for my open-source nodejs sprinkler system that I haven't committed to in about two months. Two weeks later and I had access."

For the hassle factor I'd say just buy a used Dell or HP dual-socket workstation."

homelab,384vbk,tangobravoyankee,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:21:31 2015 UTC,"Cool. Looks like there's a Chinese eBay seller with a ready-made ATX conversion cable. That's probably a good bit cheaper and easier than going the C6100 PSU + power distribution board route. Might also ask the seller if they have PCIe adapter risers for the mezzanine slot -- they've been seen in the past on the Chinese sites that sell single-node C6100 chassis.  And FWIW, my motherboards say GXX41 on them and have the 18-pin connector. I don't see any of those currently on eBay but old listings for GXX41 mention D61XP as the full assembly (tray + midplane + board) and those are available. And I think you'll need the midplane for the 8-pin connector."

homelab,380lcu,paladin40,8,Mon Jun 1 02:29:44 2015 UTC,"Basically setup the network in four parts:  WAN: Pretty self-explanatory. I have a hosted VPS I just use as a forward and/or reverse proxy depending on what I'm doing. Generally, things hosted in the DMZ pass through this VPS so I don't have to give out my actual IP address.  LAN: Hosts everything in my house. A VLAN supports a guest network with access only to the printers and an open sharing folder on the file server. JOTUNHEIMR can be configured to either pass traffic normally or route all traffic to a VPN (either my VPS or Private Internet Access VPN).  DMZ: Hosts external applications, like any DMZ. I can currently only remote access computers within this network; not sure I want to allow remote access to my LAN and defeat the purpose of my DMZ.. VANAHEIMR is configured to pass traffic back and forth to ALFHEIMR, the remote VPS. Can be toggled off to use my actual IP if I so choose.  Then there's this middle leg, sort of a DMZ to my DMZ I guess. This is where I host a read-only domain controller that mirrors the DC in my LAN. It's basically just there to allow all computers and servers in the house to connect to the same domain without also allowing the DMZ to talk directly to the LAN. Limited ports are allowed from the DMZ to this read-only DC (ports needed for DNS/DHCP and some basic active directory)."

Hola is going even further, by selling access to the network through a site called Luminati from $1.45 to $20 per GB.

homelab,37yo1h,temotodochi,1 point,Sun May 31 22:35:06 2015 UTC,"IP addresses are perfectly admissible in court, and certainly count as evidence. I'm not sure where you got the idea that they weren't. There are plenty of child predators who are located specifically through this means, and while it takes more than a single IP address to convict someone of a crime, that does not make it any less of a problem for people who will suddenly be attracting the attention of TLAs that they may not want, especially given that Hola users in the first place were looking to mask their identity anyways. A subpoena for further information is perfectly likely if an IP address associated with your ISP account is found to be participating in a known criminal activity, and given the broad nature of subpoenas and warrants for these types of crimes any illegal activity you have participated in will likely be brought to light, and possibly further entangle you with the criminal justice system.  To that end, the real issue is not the possibility of criminal proceedings and is instead the fact that Hola users are subjecting themselves to exactly what many of them were trying to avoid in the first place, which is the accumulation of specifically identifiable private information by a third party. Hola may not land you in prison, but it certainly can cause you to end up with your identity stolen or your computer compromised."

Also, Minecraft is going to have a lot of dependencies that will clutter up my host OS.   Java.  Minecraft requires Java to be installed and nothing else.  Infact you could extract java into the minecraft users' home directory, and have everything contained to /home/minecraft.   Is running ESXi or something similar a better option for me and having a VM set aside for Minecraft?   I wouldnt run ESXi on an E8400.  If you really need some small VM's, use VMware player.

homelab,37wueg,SlaveCell,3,Sun May 31 09:14:38 2015 UTC,If you're using a *nix system as your NAS you could try editing the /etc/hosts.allow file to only allow certain machines on your network to communicate with it. As far as blocking it access to the internet but still allowing it to communicate on the network you could try setting up a bogus routing path in your router maybe.

But like you need a wep/wpa key to connect to your main router would you need something similar if a second router was added and then the NAS put behind this? (this was my idea for stopping unauthorised users on the same network)  Also if there was a second router would this not act as the firewall blocking internet access to the NAS?  Sorry if these questions seem rudimentary, I have a vague knowledge of networks but no actual experience so I'm not sure if things I think would actually work in the real world."
homelab,37wueg,lordairivis,7,Sun May 31 02:07:58 2015 UTC,"If you're using a Synology NAS, all you have to do to keep others from accessing the NAS is disable ""allow guest connections."" This way, other users will be able to see the NAS on the network but if they try to get a directory listing it will prompt for a username/password.  By default the Synology won't forward any ports through to the internet and it will be pretty safe behind your router's built-in firewall, if you're worried about people outside reaching it. You're going to want to let it communicate out so you can still get software updates, though."

Ideally I'd like it so other users on the network wouldn't be able to see it at all, which is why I was wondering if it could be hidden behind a second router?  Is there anyway I could fortify it's defence against access via the internet?

homelab,37wueg,lordairivis,5,Sun May 31 02:21:01 2015 UTC,"When you set up your network shares in the DSM, there is the option to hide the share from network discovery. That should be enough.  As long as you don't forward any ports from the NAS through the router's firewall you're fine. Adding a second router into the mix won't do anything extra to protect you and will only complicate your network more than is necessary."

A virtual private network (VPN) sort of acts as an extension of your local home network that you can access remotely. If you set up a VPN and connect to it from outside of your home network, it's like you've joined your local home network.

homelab,37x097,raki27,4,Sun May 31 02:38:53 2015 UTC,"As someone with a truly insane ""homelab"" [I prefer to call it ""homeproduction"" :-)], mine has grown organically for almost 9 years now.  It started with a media storage server with a torrent client on it. Then I added an AMP stack (I wasn't Linux yet at that point) and started messing around.  7 years and multiple labs later, my most recent effort started when I finished school and began working full-time as a Linux sysadmin 2.5 years ago, and was finally able to upgrade my Internet connection, get static IPs (currently I have a /27), and both upgrade my storage server and buy a C6100. Now I run a full suite of services (DNS, email, web pages/wikis, media streaming, Asterisk, XMPP, etc.) For friends and family and am now working on an even more insane setup by amalgamating with my equally-nuts best friend.  My point is: don't think too much about everything when you start out; it's easy to get overwhelmed. Start small; just pick a few things you want to learn about, implement them, keep them running for a bit, and then think about what you want to do next. Its great for your wallet, your skillset, and your sanity, and as you learn more you can make the system more complex and feature-rich."

My first wants were, all gigabit networking and a central location to store my files and access the remotely. I also wanted learn how to build a network and to have the most freedom possible to play with new software and test stuff.  So I didn't want to buy a prebuild solution.   I did make a few mistakes along the way for example, I bought a nice poweredge server from a local surplus. It worked so well and surplue was so cheap I got another one and a SAN. Eventually my parents were wondering why our power bill was so high, and we discovered it was because of my 3 servers I was running 24/7.   I finely gave up on the old power edge servers and I got my dad to split the costs of building our own server.  So in the end we have one powerfully computer running VMware ESXI. This acts as our router, NAS, Plex, torrent, owncloud, VPN, and gaming server.   I still have my old power edges servers but I use them as backup servers for my nas, once a week they turn on and back everything up."
homelab,37x097,Catsrules,1 point,Sun May 31 20:58:44 2015 UTC,I'm looking to do a similar all in one setup.  How is your NAS setup?
homelab,37x097,_sisu,1 point,Sun May 31 22:29:43 2015 UTC,"I have used a variety of different setups for a NAS. When I first started using ESXI I used Windows server 2008. That worked really well for a lot of years. I wanted to try out Linux setup. So I install Ubuntu, with ZFS as the file system. I didn't really know what I was doing and it was kinda a hacked way of doing things to begin with so it was a pain to maintain, every update would break something. I still wanted to used ZFS, so I installed FreeNAS and have been running for that about 9 months now.   I have given Freenas 12GB and I have 4 2TB drives."
homelab,37x097,Catsrules,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:53:36 2015 UTC,To pass drives to FreeNAS you need to have a raid controller card right?
homelab,37x097,_sisu,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:56:18 2015 UTC,"Negative,  FreeNas is software raid. It is actually recommend not to use Hardware raid at all. Because It is recommended to let Freenas have complete access to the physical drives so it can keep an eye on the bits better. RAID cards will not let this happen.  Unfortunately vernalization has a similar affect. Because ESXI has direct access to the physical drives and then we create virtual drives for the VMs.  To give FreeNAS direct access to the hard drives. VMware has a thing called RAW access that gives a VM direct access to a physical drive. However my hardware does not support this. It needs to supports something called VT-d for this to work. Mine doesn't :(. This is a requirement for both the CPU and motherboard.   Basically I created a giant 2TB virtual disk on each of my 2 TB drives. Added them to the FreeNAS VM and FreeNAS it does the software raid with the virtual disks.  This isn't the best way of doing things but it does the job."
homelab,37x097,Catsrules,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:34:56 2015 UTC,This isn't the best way of doing things but it does the job.   Do you even get accurate SMART reports in this setup?
homelab,37x097,sundsta,1 point,Mon Jun 1 12:08:01 2015 UTC,"Now that you mention it I don't know, that is something I had on my list of things to do but never checked. Not really sure how I would test that, I guess I would need a drive that failed a smart test?  I know esxi has a SMART report built in, so ESXI will get accurate results. But I don't know if ESXI passes the SMART errors over to the VM.  My guess would be no."
homelab,37x097,Catsrules,5,Mon Jun 1 18:45:15 2015 UTC,"ESXI is a great hypervisor that will allow you to grab a single piece of ""good"" hardware (like a Dell rack server) and put all kinds of different things on it simultaneously. This not only cuts down on physical devices, but also allows for some extreme flexibility and quick testing of operating systems. You can then put pfsense or another linux firewall onto a dedicated device or also as a VM on the hypervisor that would allow you to segregate your homelab from your home's network, but would also allow for your homelab to have internet connectivity. If possible, ensure you have QoS rules setup on both your homelab router and at your home's point of entry router. Correctly established QoS will ensure your boyfriend's gaming is not affected while you simultaneously can mess around on the network (file transfers, internet downloads and uploads, etc.)  Honestly, good QoS will negate the need for a second router between your homelab and home network as it will ensure he gets the bandwidth and priority he needs, however a second router would allow for better segmentation of the overall network and can be used for various other functions.  I am currently setting up my own homelab to start studying for my CCENT renewal that I let lapse and start working towards my CCNA after that. I sort of planned out my lab but in hindsight I wish I had looked into more complicated and ""advanced"" setups in order to provide greater modularity and upgradeability in the future. Built a NAS based on Nas4Free located inside a Fractal Cube. I designed and built the NAS and then 3 months later decided I needed to build a full homelab after coming across this reddit. The fractal cube eats 7U of space for the rack I am designing and I wish I had acquired a rack mountable case that would have severed me better in the long run as a NAS.  Planning will only get you so far with a homelab as it will continue to evolve and change if you are active with it, but planning basic areas such as how you want storage set up (NAS, SAN, etc.) or how many servers you will need (multiple physical servers or a hypervisor with lots of resources). My NAS is running in ESXI along with windows server 2012 R2 which is used for crashplan (offsite backup) and eventually for active directory and some other services.  The actual lab side of my network will mainly be comprised of a few CISCO switches and eventually routers to aid me in my network certifications. However, I will be playing around with all kinds of different services and OSs in the future.  Honestly,y  I am still messing around with my NAS (it can be considered in my lab and on my home network really) and kinda wish I had gone a SAN route for the pure upgradeability aspect. I can add 2 more HDDs into my current case for it, but I may eventually outgrow that space and will then have to look into changing my storage system around. Might have saved money if I had just gone to a SAN with a rack case that supported a huge number of drives to begin with.  Just some food for thought!"

Currently I am not messing with it a bunch and simply use putty and google remote desktop to control my Nas4Free and Windows server, respectively. Once you get the ESXI box setup you don't need to mess with it much outside of setting up new VMs and network connections. I haven't really delved too deep into the settings available through vsphere, but I probably will look into more once I get my homelab built.  Also, didnt go the KVM route because Linux ends up annoying me to no end and I was looking for something with decent hardware support that I could just setup and go..... However, it took me about 3-4 days to get ESXI setup as I am using a super micro board instead of a true server and had to start with a lower version of ESXI that still contained needed drivers and then update to the latest version. I also ended up having to patch in additional drivers and reinstalling a few days later when I tried adding a SATA card to connect the Host HDD to. This allowed me to free upo my 6 onboard SATA ports for HDD passthrough into Nas4Free. I probably ended up spending as much time on ESXI as I would have with KVM, but the windows style interface and the guides already laid out for driver patching were very easy and helpful."

I'll be bonding two gigabit NICs from my FreeNAS box to my Mikrotik, and once that's all set up I plan on building a Mini-ITX VM host (I don't have anywhere to put loud PC equipment) for testing, using a small SSD as a boot drive and storing the disks on my NAS via iSCSI. Hopefully I can keep that host under the $600 mark with a Xeon and 32GB RAM."
homelab,37x097,sundsta,2,Mon Jun 1 12:17:31 2015 UTC,"It started with an Iomega NAS and grew bigger over the years. There is a big “because I can” factor involved here, but the last iteration (iterations occur about once a year) I went through some thorough planning.  As for storage, My NAS used to be a Norco, but the SAS backplanes kept failing. I decided I needed something better, which turned out to be a Supermicro SC846. Currently, the limitation of my NAS is the three IBM BR10i’s I have in there - they limit drive size to 2Gb. I thought this was a decent tradeoff, as the 24x2Tb drives it accepts will last some time. I know I will either have to flash the BR10i’s, upgrade to M1015's or Dell Perc’s somewhere in the future. Running Solaris / ZFS because that is what I am used to.  At some point in time I planned to upgrade the NAS to a SAN and go all fiber. I got a Silkworm off Ebay and bought a few Qlogic fiberchannel cards and did manage to get them working. I never implemented it fully though, as my hypervisor (SmartOS) does not support FC. It’s a philosophical discussion, really. The upgrade path for the NAS is pretty clear to me: I need to replace the Xeon 3440 that is in the NAS with something more energy efficient (ZFS is more about mem than cpu anyway). Next to that I am considering expanding the storage with the help of the NetApp DS14MK2, a JBOD chassis that is not too expensive second hand and would allow me to daisy chain to a quite awesome number of drives.   As for VMs, initially I ran a few Sun Fire V20Z machines. They are starting to get outdated though and do consume a lot of power (always something to factor in). I replaced them with a whitebox Xeon v1230v2 machine running Proxmox, but I kept having issues with the memory on the motherboard (Supermicro X9SCL-F). Turned out the memory was faulty, but that took quite some time to find out. After a lot of research I decided upon the Dell R710 to replace it, which I ordered with dual hexacores and 72Gb of mem. I seriously love that machine, and it’s not even that power hungry (about 150watt on average). I switched from Proxmox to SmartOS because - again - Solaris and its derivatives is what I am used to. SmartOS is something to consider though, especially if your world does not involve Windows. Currently running 36 VMs on that. The upgrade path for the VM machine would be to switch from SmartOS to SmartDataCenter, Joyent’s fully managed virtualisation solution. Even though it is possible to run this on one machine, preferably I would have a headnode and a (or more) compute node(s). Figuring out what to use for a headnode has been keeping me busy for the past few weeks, and again power consumption is important here. Ideally I would go with another Dell R710, but not a dual hexacore.  Software I run on the VM machines is split up in essential software, and testing. For me, essential is my web stack (Nginx and PHP-FM, but also Node/Ghost), my database (Percona), documents (Alfresco), DNS (Unbound and NSD), media streaming (Plex), monitoring (Sensu, RabbitMQ, Redis, Uchiwa and Flapjack), mail (Xeams), downloads (NZBGet and Deluge), security monitoring (Zoneminder) and telephony (FreePBX). Testing is the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Hadoop and Spark, Hbase, GNS3 and Graphite/Grafana. I only install if I have a use case: I use ELK for example to parse the EXIF and ID3 metadata of all photos and mp3s I have, which is a lot of fun to do.  As far as switches and routers are concerned I used to run a TP-Link web managed gigabit switch, but replaced that recently with a Mikrotik Cloud Router Switch. Nothing wrong with the TP-Link, but just not sexy enough. The Mikrotik is sexy. I have an Ebay acquired 100Mbit Cisco switch I am using for the management network, and a HP KVM switch that I choose primarily because it uses standard CAT5 cables to transport KVM traffic from the machines to the switch. My main router is a Supermicro Atom based (D525) PFSense install that just runs fine.   Powerwise, it took a lot of hesitation before I decided on an APC 1500 VA RM, which I got a very good deal on (second hand). What made me buy it was basically that I had a brownout that fried two harddrives, and replacing those was expensive enough.  All is housed in a Sun 900 rack, which I ordered after extensive research again - and in the end I bought it primarily because it looks good and I was able to get it cheap!"

You are definitely using hardware ESXI is not meant to be used on and as I said, most likely does not have the drivers for that motherboard. When I talk about intel NICs working flawlessly I am talking (at a minimum) low server grade components, such as Super Micro boards. True consumer grade stuff will be hit and miss for compatibility, at least without searching for the drivers for your particular board and embedding them into the ESXI image.  EDIT: Here is the link for the driver for your intel NIC https://vibsdepot.v-front.de/wiki/index.php/Net-e1000e  Adding drivers to the ESXI ISO http://blog.kihltech.com/2014/01/how-to-add-intel-nic-drivers-to-an-esxi-5-5-iso/ ESXI is constantly having drivers removed so it is less user friendly and does not work with consumer grade components because the ESXI team wants its users to purchase true servers.

To OP; Intel NICs are preferred because Realtek NICs have been shown to provide lower throughput and many times are unable to reach true gigabit speeds. People have debated this issue on here and on ESXI forums all over the net and I was trying to make a quick statement on the fact that Intel NICs have become the accepted default. You are perfectly free to choose Realtek NICs for your project as long as you understand their limitations and can accept them. Realtek NICs may be good for a pfsense box or other internet router box if your internet link is well below gigabit speeds.

As for mounting the controller you will have to get creative as these controllers are normally meant for standard PC cases. I mounted mine initially with Velcro n then later went back and screwed it into the case.

homelab,37rpyr,pekesenertjes,12,Fri May 29 21:17:37 2015 UTC,"Neat idea -- that is a huge case for three NUC's.  You could get away with a case a quarter that size and use a HP 1910-8G instead of that huge switch for 5 ports.  Here is a good example of a lab-in-a-box.  Quarter the size, twice the hardware with a display, 4g router onboard, and fits in carry-on.  It is still inefficient.  Should be able to find a single power supply for all 6 NUC's.  They use 19V DC.  I bet you could use a Dell 200 watt laptop power supply to a DC bus and power all the NUC's off that, or two of these.  Then there is still a huge amount of space for more hardware."

homelab,37pul8,regmaster,3,Fri May 29 15:49:15 2015 UTC,"Definitely runs warmer than any other I've seen. Idles at around 43C. And the four 80mm fans make it loud as hell. I can barely hear someone 15 feet away if I'm in the same room.   It's not a terrible server, but not a great one either. It was my first, however, so I went with cheap. Now you can get an R610 for just a bit more, and it'll be much cooler, quieter, and energy efficient.  Edit: OH yeah. The Nighthawk is alright. Definitely wasn't worth the $220 I paid when it first came out. Its built-in guest network feature is complete shit and rarely works correctly. Now I used pfSense as my router (the PC beneath the Nighthawk) and the Nighthawk is just my 802.11AC access point. If you want a router like that, get a Linksys AC 1900. Little more expensive, but way more functional and stable. Much higher quality overall."
homelab,37pul8,regmaster,2,Fri May 29 16:02:08 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat. I paid $220 for it and have a few problems:   Guest network is shit (as you mentioned). The only saving grace is that it lets you VLAN it separately so it's not on the same subnet as your personal devices. 5 GHz network doesn't work with all devices. Not sure if that's the router's fault or my Samsung Galaxy S4's fault, but I'm unable to connect to the 5 GHz network with my GS4 unless I'm in the same room as the router. No DNS server capability unless you install OpenWRT QoS is dogshit. Not very granular end enabling downstream QoS will cause virtually all UDP packets to get dropped when maxing out the network connection. I couldn't figure out why my Vonage didn't work while downloading games on Steam until I realized the the ""QoS"" was doing the exact opposite of what it should be doing. Traffic Meter loses all historical data whenever power is loss or router is rebooted.  DHCP can be flaky. I host some servers so static IPs are a must. I've had to configure them both on the router and the device, but sometimes the router forgets the reservation and assigns a different IP, causing my device to drop off the local network and the server to go offline. ""VPN support"" only allows you to VPN into the router from a remote location. It doesn't allow you to force all traffic (or all traffic on the guest SSID) to be routed through a VPN. What's the point of the 1 GHz processor on the router if you can't even encrypt traffic and pass it through a VPN?   I could go on. I'm not thrilled with it; sooner or later I'll probably do what you did and just use it as a wireless bridge. Those Mikrotiks look pretty cool and can do all this router does (and more!) at a fraction of what I paid for it.  Edit: I forgot my main point. I should have known better than to buy a router that was marketed as ""gamer certified""."
homelab,37pul8,wolfmann,1 point,Fri May 29 18:12:41 2015 UTC,"The S4 should have 5GHz capability, so that's strange, but doesn't surprise me with this router. QoS was horrendous. Took me a week to realize why my speedtests were reading 0.02Mbps.  I'd definitely just use it for its AP capabilities. Never fails me then. Get an old PC and try pfSense. Little learning curve, but once you get it down, you have unlimited control of every aspect of your network. Truly amazing software."

homelab,37siez,TheBlackVista,2,Sat May 30 01:05:12 2015 UTC,"c19/20 is the same as c13/14 except that it has a higher load rating (basically, the cords are thicker). The purpose of a different plug is to ensure that a 16A load can't be plugged in with a cord rated for 10A.  You can plug this into any voltage, assuming the power supply is auto switching."
homelab,37siez,VexingRaven,2,Sat May 30 02:54:00 2015 UTC,You also need a higher rated wall outlet (and everything else between the server and mains power). Normal US wall outlets (NEMA 5-15) are only rated for 15 amps. It would be dangerous to plug a server with a C19/C20 PSU into a regular US home outlet.
homelab,37siez,KillAllTheThings,2,Sat May 30 04:02:03 2015 UTC,"Not exactly. Circuit breakers exist to prevent overload. You cannot have a 5-15 plug without also having a 15A breaker, assuming you're all up to code. The circuit breaker must always be the lowest rating of all wiring and connections in a circuit. The absolute worst thing that could happen is you trip the breaker and somehow kill the PSU in the process. And it's highly unlikely a server with a c19 is going to trip a 15A breaker. When was the last time you maxed out a PSU? That would be a monster of a server."

NEMA 5–15R is the standard electricity outlet found in almost every household and building in the United States. Similar and interchangeable connectors are used in Canada and Mexico. NEMA wiring devices are made in current ratings from 15 to 60 amperes, and voltage ratings from 125 to 600 volts. Different combinations of contact blade widths, shapes, orientation, and dimensions give non-interchangeable connectors that are unique to a particular voltage, current capacity, and grounding system. NEMA 1 (two-prong) and NEMA 5 (three-prong) connectors are used for commonplace domestic equipment; the others are for heavy duty or special purposes. The dimensional standard for electrical connectors is ANSI/NEMA WD–6 and is available from the NEMA website.

If you run Windows 2012 as your desktop RDP8.x has pretty awesome performance and can push two displays to the thin client as two displays.

I've got another command-line script ""toipad <file>"" that emails that file to my Kindle (on my ipad).

homelab,37o6ho,HifiBoombox,2,Fri May 29 02:16:25 2015 UTC,"As someone who has been running a home NAS using random sized disks for a decade now, my advice is to think about the quesiton of what do you do when a disk fails?  Imagine your oldest, smallest disk fails.  You're not going to replace it with a matching old disk from some inventory.  You could replace it with a modern big disk if your system allows growing onto a larger disk but then you'd have to buy a replacement drive every time a crappy old drive fails.  And not all array mechanisms allow you to grow by swapping in a single larger disk.  Personally, what I wanted was a system where I could replace the failed disk if I wanted, or not replace it at all if I didn't need the space.  It has been a few years since I looked closely at zfs, but my understanding back then was that if you built a pool with n disks then you could not shrink below that many disks.  I ended up with btrfs.  It allows me to throw all my disks into a pool, run raid1 on them for redundancy, and add or remove disks at will.  If a small old disk fails and I don't want to replace it, I don't.  I simply tell btrfs to remove it from the pool and any data that was stored on it is restriped onto different disks.  I can add and remove and restripe and change raid formats all on a live filesystem without needing to unmount.  The only question I have to ask is when removing a disk (because I want to, or because it failed) is: do I have enough space for the data?  If so, I can make the change.  btrfs is not considered to be as mature of a fs.  However, I store all of my data on two different filesystems (and having the ability to use/add/remove random drives anytime makes having 2 filesystems easy).  I'm literally using old drives from the ""garbage pile"" of old unwanted computers.  I have raid1 redundancy on each filesystem, and then two copies of the file on different filesystems (plus a 3rd copy offsite for the truly important data), I feel I've pretty well mitigated any concerns about possible issues on a single filesystem.  I've probably made 20 drive add/remove changes to my filesystem in a month (just screwing around with it to learn) using ""garbage"" disks and haven't had a single issue."
homelab,37o6ho,mattbuford,1 point,Fri May 29 04:01:32 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your input, I am in the exact same situation with these hard drives. I need cheap storage for my NAS, so I end up taking hard drives from old HP workstations. I hadn't even considered btrfs, and now I will definitely look into it.   How much raw storage do you have? And how much useable?"
homelab,37o6ho,mattbuford,1 point,Fri May 29 04:13:13 2015 UTC,"Well, it turns out my array is offline, but not due to anything related to it.  There is a quirk with the OS install that I haven't had a chance to fix yet that requires manual intervention to boot, plus my UPS decided to die, plus I went out of town, plus major storms hit Texas causing a power blip ... so I assume my array is sitting at a half-booted error now.  Sigh.  Anyway, the general wisdom with btrfs is that raid1 is safe, but raid5/6 are perhaps iffy.  They're claiming (within the last month or so) to have raid5/6 now stable, but who knows...  So, for now I am using raid1.  I have enough junk drives that I have enough space even with raid1.  I'm hoping that raid6 will mature enough before I really end up needing it.  To be honest, because it is a random pile of drives (and offline) I can't recall exactly what I have.  Something like this:  1 100G SATA laptop drive  2 250G PATA drives (I think these were ripped from old Tivos) connected via some crappy USB2 external adapters.  2 500G SATA drives  1 120G SATA drive  1 1T SATA drive that was the cold spare drive for my previous generation ext4+lvm+raid6 array  Usable space is simply total space divided by 2.  I can add or remove drives and it stays as simple as that.  It only gets more complex if one disk is bigger than all other disks combined.  For example, 1T + 100G + 100G would be a problem because there isn't enough space on all other drives to raid1 mirror a full TB from the first drive.  In the future I hope to do raid6, and then the calculation is more complex, but it does exactly what you'd hope it would do.  http://carfax.org.uk/btrfs-usage/  Play with that a bit and you'll see what I mean.  For example, raid6 with 1T + 1T + 1T + 100G gives 1.1T usable (100G 4 drive array + 900G 3 drive array).  10 years ago, I built something that operated very much like Synology Hybrid Raid, but  did all the changes manually.  It was a nightmare any time a disk died just because it took so much work (and so much chance for human error).  For years I saw drobo and thought that sounds like what I want, except I don't want a tiny 5 drive box that costs a fortune.  Btrfs has finally given me this.  I just rebuilt my NAS using a $55 motherboard+cpu, two 4 port SATA cards (plus 2 on MB for a total of 10), plus USB3 for even more drives.  Super cheap and with USB3 I can keep going for quite a ways.  At this point the system will do whatever I want as far as drive configurations and it does the best possible thing that can be done with those drives (except raid6).  At this point I'm kind of winding down my playing aroud and I'm starting to pull the smaller disks out of the array for no other reason than power savings.  I can trivially add them back one at a time as the array slowly fills up, so there's no point in keeping them all spinning from the start.  I finally have my drobo-like dream flexibility and I'm only lacking raid6 at this point."
homelab,37o6ho,mattbuford,1 point,Fri May 29 04:42:01 2015 UTC,"Got home and restarted my array...  Here are the btrfs drives currently:  1x 100 GB SATA laptop drive internal 1x 120 GB PATA via USB2 enclosure 2x 500 GB PATA via USB2 enclosures 1x 500 GB SATA via hotswap bay 1x 1 TB SATA via hotswap bay (currently not connected just to save power as space isn't needed yet)   My OS is still running on the old ext4 array, which is 5 identical 1 TB SATA disks in hotswap bays.  This uses md to run in raid6.  LVM is also being used, but I'm not really taking advantage of it.  The entire raid6 is just allocated directly to the root filesystem.  In the long term, I want to move entirely to btrfs and phase out the ext4 array (adding those drives into btrfs) but I wanted to dip my toes into btrfs for a while before I go all in.  What I do is put /boot on a USB stick and boot off that.  That holds an initramfs which allows USB, md, lvm, btrfs scan, and all these other things to start that might be required before the / filesystem can mount.  Some people recommend to have a dedicated OS drive, but I prefer to just have my OS be a part of the array.  I want my OS to be redundant too, and dedicated 2 drives to it seems like a waste.  The claim is that having the storage array be different allows you to work on the storage array without losing your / mount, but I find that this to be a very rare problem.  Besides, I almost never unmount btrfs since it lets me make all my changes online.  :)  Some btrfs stats:  Label: 'usbdrive1'  uuid: 5a8087fc-eb86-4656-9d4c-d1d1083157b0     Total devices 5 FS bytes used 685.51GiB     devid    2 size 465.76GiB used 421.00GiB path /dev/sdg1     devid    3 size 465.76GiB used 421.03GiB path /dev/sdf1     devid    7 size 111.76GiB used 67.00GiB path /dev/sdj     devid    8 size 465.76GiB used 421.03GiB path /dev/sdm     devid    9 size 93.16GiB used 48.00GiB path /dev/sdh     Data, RAID1: total=686.00GiB, used=683.83GiB System, RAID1: total=32.00MiB, used=144.00KiB Metadata, RAID1: total=3.00GiB, used=1.69GiB GlobalReserve, single: total=512.00MiB, used=0.00B         Overall: Device size:                   1.56TiB Device allocated:              1.35TiB Device unallocated:          224.14GiB Device missing:                  0.00B Used:                          1.34TiB Free (estimated):            114.24GiB      (min: 114.24GiB) Data ratio:                       2.00 Metadata ratio:                   2.00 Global reserve:              512.00MiB      (used: 0.00B)      Data,RAID1: Size:686.00GiB, Used:683.83GiB /dev/sdf1     419.00GiB /dev/sdg1     420.00GiB /dev/sdh       48.00GiB /dev/sdj       66.00GiB /dev/sdm      419.00GiB  Metadata,RAID1: Size:3.00GiB, Used:1.69GiB /dev/sdf1       2.00GiB /dev/sdg1       1.00GiB /dev/sdj        1.00GiB /dev/sdm        2.00GiB  System,RAID1: Size:32.00MiB, Used:144.00KiB /dev/sdf1      32.00MiB /dev/sdm       32.00MiB  Unallocated: /dev/sdf1      44.73GiB /dev/sdg1      44.76GiB /dev/sdh       45.16GiB /dev/sdj       44.76GiB /dev/sdm       44.73GiB     # cat /proc/partitions                                                                                                               major minor  #blocks  name  8       16  976762584 sdb 8       17  976759808 sdb1 8       32  976762584 sdc 8       33  976760001 sdc1 8       48  976762584 sdd 8       49  976761560 sdd1 8       80  488386584 sdf 8       81  488385560 sdf1 8       64  976762584 sde 8       65  976760001 sde1 8       96  488386584 sdg 8       97  488385560 sdg1 8      112   97685784 sdh 8        0  976762584 sda 8        1  976760001 sda1 8      128    1953791 sdi 8      129    1952767 sdi1 8      144  117187500 sdj 8      160  976762584 sdk 8      161  976760001 sdk1 8      176  976762584 sdl 8      177  976760001 sdl1 8      192  488386584 sdm 8      208  976762584 sdn 8      209  976760001 sdn1 8      224  117220824 sdo 9      127 1953519872 md127 253        0 1953517568 dm-0 9        0 2930279232 md0 253        1 2637250560 dm-1"

You need 8GB of RAM and a reasonably recent CPU to get a decent experience - if you only have 4GB of RAM, it will be very slow, but you could probably still get things done. If you have less than 4GB , don't bother. With 5 Windows VMs, you should assign 1 GB of RAM to each one. You could assign less, and people have got it working with 512MB, but it's slow.  Here's a beginners guide to VirtualBox. There are hundreds of guides, so just use Google and work through them. You should be able to figure it out fairly quickly  http://lifehacker.com/5204434/the-beginners-guide-to-creating-virtual-machines-with-virtualbox  The basic principle is simple   Create 5 Windows VMs in Virtual Box.

homelab,37npow,yokken,2,Thu May 28 23:57:04 2015 UTC,"A couple of thoughts and questions.    What protocol are you using? CIFS/SMB or NFS? Have you tried the other? I have seen this behavior from Windows on CIFS and switching to NFS on Linux saturated a 1Gbps LAN. What does ESXi show as the used RAM on the FreeNAS VM? Can you see CPU usage on the Synology?  What model is the Synology? Smallnetbuilder has a good collection of SMB NAS performance data, might be worth checking if they have tested your unit. Plug into the network with the MBP and try to connect to the Synology with NFS if possible and pull down something like 30GB of large files and let us know the read speed.  The folks at the FreeNAS forums would tell you that you need more RAM, I think. Do you have deduplication or compression turned on?"
homelab,37npow,SayCyberOneMoreTime,1 point,Fri May 29 00:21:27 2015 UTC,"So I have a few answers for you, but not all of them.   Using CIFS/SMB to transfer. Have not used NFS but I'm sure I could set it up. I'm selling the Synology to a friend so I'm not too concerned if it's a problem on the Synology side. 1Gbps LAN is not saturated, it's pretty idle most of the time. Also just confirmed that my Mikrotik's CPU load is at about 5% right now, so there's no bottleneck there. Doing a large transfer right now and ESXi shows 6.2GB used out of the 8GB reserved. Network is at about 29MB/s. It's got 8 vCPUs and is currently averaging about 3200MHz used across all 8 cores/threads, floating around 50-60% load. Synology CPU load said 25% with 18% RAM usage (out of 1GB). Synology model is DS413 with 2x2TB WD Red and 2x3TB WD Red. I know it's weird, but I started with 2x2TB and saw a deal on 3TBs a month later and snagged two. I know they're only being used as 2TBs. I toyed with the idea of giving FreeNAS 16GB of reserved RAM, but I think that's a little much for something that is idle 90% of the time. I could give it 12GB reserved if that might improve performance. No dedup or compression - it's just a basic volume with stock settings, besides encryption.   I can test with my MBP later but I'm working on other stuff at the moment. Thanks!"
homelab,37npow,canhazraid,2,Fri May 29 01:03:20 2015 UTC,You really need to start with a clean environment with ethernet.  Benchmark each component and find the bottleneck.  Protocol matters.  You may also just be experiencing FreeNAS flushing data to disk.  A SLOG on SSD can improve performance.  Array encryption will cause a 30% performance drop if your CPU cant do offloading for the encryption.

homelab,37npow,bahwhateverr,1 point,Fri May 29 01:14:13 2015 UTC,"I knew encryption would cause performance to tank, but I didn't think it'd be this low. Do you know what I should expect for speeds? Apparently they are 5400rpm drives, but WD doesn't actually state that in their official docs - they call it IntelliPower. Thank you AnandTech. In the official WD docs though, it says they can hold 175MB/s sustained writes. I assume this would drop a bit in a parity setup as well. But 30MB/s seems really low to me.  Could I carve out a chunk of an SSD that I'm using as a datastore (got some space to spare) and add that as a drive to my FreeNAS VM, and then use that as an SLOG? I haven't ever heard of that before. I'd probably give it 20-30GB if it's worth trying.  I really don't want to rip apart my network and server just to test disk performance, but I can appreciate the approach. I mean technically the best way to do it would be to run FreeNAS on bare metal and do a raw dd test on each drive, and then on the encrypted array. Then I could test various protocols over Ethernet, but I don't see myself using NFS practically since I've never used it with OS X or Windows, and I doubt Windows plays nicely with it. CIFS/SMB is just compatible with everything...  I could POTENTIALLY hook my server up to an unmanaged switch connected to the Synology and see if that improves anything... I'm running DHCP and DNS on my domain controller so I don't really lose much by hooking stuff up to the unmanaged switch, but it would be annoying to have my MBP out in the living room with all of my stuff just so I can orchestrate the testing. But... that's the /r/homelab way.  Thanks!"
homelab,37npow,bahwhateverr,2,Fri May 29 01:12:04 2015 UTC,"it says they can hold 175MB/s sustained writes.   That may be true for sequential writes (large files, bit after bit).  Use IOMeter to get a true sense of performance.  Also keep in mind that ZFS writes to the SLOG on your VDEV, then commits the data to disk (two writes).  Both writes (SLOG and actual) are then delayed due to disk SYNC.  Disable sync (at your own peril) and you'll see a massive speed increase.  Move the SLOG to SSD and you will see a massive speed increase.  FreeNAS's motto should be ""safe, but slow (at times)""."
homelab,37npow,bahwhateverr,2,Fri May 29 01:19:29 2015 UTC,"No need to guess, measure! There are many possibilities for this, but lets just focus on three: CPU, Storage, Network. Start up a nice long copy job and then from a shell in FreeNAS:  run top, whats the idle time look like? Is the CPU pegged?   run iostat -x 1, are any of the disks at or near 100 in the %b column?  If your answers so far have all be no then it's most likely network related. Specifically you may be running into single threaded synchronous IO (not to be confused with sync/flush writes) where your bandwidth is effectively limited by the latency. Moving to async will most likely help. I don't know if FreeNAS loads the aio module by default but kldstat -v | grep aio will tell you. If it's not loaded and you wish to load it sudo kldload aio will do the job.  Check /usr/local/etc/smb.conf, the options I use in this regard are  socket options = TCP_NODELAY aio read size = 16384 aio write size = 16384   I get about 108MB/s over gigabit and I max out my pool speed (550MB/s on a raidz2 and 850MB/s on a raid0) over 10 gigabit.
