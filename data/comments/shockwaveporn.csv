Yes, it's probably dangerous as fuck. Explosions are unpredictable things, and unless you're a trained gunsmith, don't play around making explosive devices that you carry in you hand. The recoil is also a danger, but I think the people in this video were aware of this, holding the cannon in a way that allows them to absorb it. The ""good"" thing about cannons it that it's single shot, so there's no risk of accidentally shooting someone else when the recoil flips the muzzle."

shockwaveporn,3dcnj1,abstractattack,2,Wed Jul 15 11:43:24 2015 UTC,"How does dynamite not prematurely set off other (close proximity) dynamite when configured and detonated, like the gif? I guess it must be stable enough to not react to the seismic shock(?). Can some one explain?  Edit:added word"
shockwaveporn,3dcnj1,GoodAtExplaining,6,Wed Jul 15 15:29:12 2015 UTC,"The reason is because they're not using dynamite.  Many of the explosives used in demolition today are exceptionally stable (RDX, tricyclonite, C9, etc).  These explosives are so stable, you can put them in a fire or hit them with a hammer, and they won't go off. They are what are referred to as first-order explosives. First order explosives need heat AND pressure to detonate, second-order explosives, such as mercury fulminate, need only heat (Source) edit: Third-order explosives need only pressure to detonate.  Usually these first-order explosives will have a blasting cap attached, and that blasting cap is made up of second-order explosives, sort of like a sandwich - Mercury fulminate on top, C4 on the bottom. The blasting cap goes off, providing enough heat and pressure to detonate the C4.   The size of the explosive also matters, which is why you don't see one giant charge, but a lot of smaller ones (Edit: A few large charges have the potential of setting off shockwaves that will unintentionally set off nearby explosives, creating an uncontrolled chain reaction. Several smaller and well-spaced explosives will not have the energy to do so, all of it will go into moving material).  This has several benefits, such as reduced dust and movement of the material to be removed, but also a much more stable explosion, and fewer unintended explosions etc - It's always good to use several smaller quantities of explosive than one larger one, as you can more accurately control the explosion and ensure its stability and behaviour.   As a result, what you have are small charges, separated by a lot of medium, and a very stable explosive. This results in a detonation that is precisely controlled, but also far less dangerous than through use of more traditional explosive materials."

shockwaveporn,39neyw,matthew7s26,2,Sat Jun 13 00:06:34 2015 UTC,"Really neat bit of trivia?  Those ""squawk-squawk"" noises, about 2 seconds before the boom?  Those are pheasants.  They can hear the explosion long before the sound reaches them, and will call in reaction to it.  Depending on your circumstances and location in the world, this could be a valuable little tidbit of knowledge."
shockwaveporn,39neyw,IonOtter,4,Sat Jun 13 05:58:34 2015 UTC,"I also think he meant feel it. Shock waves travel faster through the ground than through the air, I think."
shockwaveporn,39neyw,IonOtter,1 point,Sat Jun 13 10:03:31 2015 UTC,"That's a very good question, really?  As Matthew7s26 points out, shock waves travel faster through the ground, than the air.  Sometimes.  It depends on the kind of ground.  But my own observations, and knowing the habitat of pheasants (farm fields) don't really support the shock wave theory.  Soft, farm soil is not a good conductor of vibration.  Does anyone out there know the math behind this?  Is the pheasant hearing the blast before I do?  (They're closer)  And I hear them react?  (They're closer to me than the shockwave.)  Then I hear the blast.  Would that be correct?"
shockwaveporn,39neyw,Reagonlol,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:48:10 2015 UTC,I would assume that the volcano makes some rumbling before the actual blast as the magma rushes its way through the ground towards the surface.

shockwaveporn,38j2e0,restricteddata,15,Fri Jun 5 15:02:56 2015 UTC,"One of the things I like about this kind of footage is that it underscores how much more powerful actual nukes are. 500 tons of TNT is quite a lot of TNT. But compared to even a relatively small nuke, that is a pretty small mushroom cloud, and it is obviously much less hot (it lacks the long blinding white pulse that is associated even with small nuclear detonations, and quickly turns dark, a sign of cooling).  Whenever an ammo dump blows up, there are always conspiracy theorists saying, oh, maybe it's a tactical nuclear weapon! But it never is hot enough to be a nuke. Conventional weapons just don't get into the right energy regime, and it's obvious if you know what to look for in terms of the color of the fireball."
shockwaveporn,38j2e0,roryr6,13,Thu Jun 4 16:49:16 2015 UTC,Also nukes have a double pulse.   http://gfycat.com/ScratchyConfusedChimpanzee
shockwaveporn,38j2e0,restricteddata,4,Thu Jun 4 17:27:33 2015 UTC,Right. Though sometimes that isn't always as easy to see in the footage.
shockwaveporn,38j2e0,Dilong-paradoxus,5,Thu Jun 4 18:32:45 2015 UTC,"For smaller nukes the two pulses are much closer together so it's harder to see, although it'll still show up in high speed footage."
shockwaveporn,38j2e0,restricteddata,4,Thu Jun 4 23:07:06 2015 UTC,Right. The relationship between pulse duration and yield means that it is generally not very useful for trying to convince people that large conventional explosions are not nuclear ones. Whereas the blinding flash is present no matter what.

You can see on the right there's a small bump in front of the camera, if it was the shockwave I would expect the to be a lessening of the effect but it's constant. I may be totally incorrect but that's my theory and I'm sticking to it until something better comes along."

Second by staggering them it gives time for the rock in the first det to move to give room for the second dets material to move. If they didn't do it this was it would all compress on each other and you would move/fracture less and less material.

If you're importing from China, most likely theres going to be a variety of different fireworks in a whole bunch of plastic wrap and cardboard boxes as buffer. When you confine an entire homogenous mixture of flash powder in one place, at the same time, you're going to get a massive explosion.

I used to have a video of something like 430,000 lbs of explosives going off. It was the largest one I'd ever seen over there.

shockwaveporn,355x6a,ExtraPlanetal,4,Thu May 7 12:05:11 2015 UTC,I would also really like to know what that flash is.  Sadly this gets asked every time a  similar video is posted and it is never answered.
shockwaveporn,355x6a,ShadowOps84,10,Thu May 7 12:08:05 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure it's the flicker from the laser designating the target for the missile, you can see it here during an APKWS test, the missile is slightly off target.  It tends to be a series of pulses as opposed to a constant stream of light so at this reduced filming speed it would appear as a flash.  Even in real time you can see it flicker so it's not such a high frequency anyway."
shockwaveporn,355x6a,sound_puppy,6,Thu May 7 12:17:18 2015 UTC,"It depends on which Hellfire variant is being used.  For anti-armor, they typically use a penetrator, while anti-personel and anti -materiel tend to be straight up HE.  Source: former OH-58D armament guy."
shockwaveporn,355x6a,eidetic,2,Thu May 7 15:43:15 2015 UTC,So could you say this is how the missile 'touches' the tank?
shockwaveporn,355x6a,Louisthefuckenlawyer,0,Thu May 7 15:58:33 2015 UTC,"Laser was my guess as well, and if it somehow isn't, perhaps just some caustic from the ambient lighting being reflected/refracted and momentarily focused on that spot from the optics of the seeker head?"
shockwaveporn,355x6a,Sans-Culotte,4,Thu May 7 20:59:15 2015 UTC,"I don't have a definite answer for that but it's probably something to do with the laser spot that the missile is homing on, you can see it flickering on a target here, at this level of slow motion the time between flashes would be much longer."
shockwaveporn,355x6a,phraustyie,3,Fri May 8 01:18:06 2015 UTC,Gotcha. When you view it with the mindset of slowmo and lasers it seems clear that's exactly what it is. I suppose that's only about a thousandth of a second of video in real time. Thanks for answering me.

shockwaveporn,34npd0,rcastaneda,100,Sat May 2 21:00:18 2015 UTC,"The immediate ecological damage from the blast was staggering. Nearly 1,000 sea otters, a species once hunted to near extinction, were killed, their skulls crushed by the shockwaves of the explosion. Other marine mammals died when their eyes were blown out of their sockets or when their lungs ruptured. Thousands of birds also perished, their spines snapped and their legs pushed through their bodies. (Neither the Pentagon nor the Fish and Wildlife Service has ever studied the long-term ecological consequences of the Amchitka explosions.) Most worrisome was that a large volume of water from White Alice Creek vanished after the blast. The disappearance of the creek was more than a sign of Cannikin’s horrific power. It was also an indication that the project had gone terribly wrong; the blast ruptured the crust of the earth, sucking the creek into a brand new aquifer, a radioactive one.  In the months following the explosion, blood and urine samples were taken from Aleuts living in the village of Adak on a nearby island. The samples were shown to have abnormally high levels of tritium and cesium-137, both known carcinogens. Despite these alarming findings, the feds never went back to Adak to conduct follow-up medical studies. The Aleuts, who continue their seafaring lifestyle, are particularly vulnerable to radiation-contaminated fish and marine mammals, and radiation that might spread through the Bering Sea, plants and iceflows.

I do understand the argument that this particular explosion might not have had the most need for a stabilization, but I think if anything, the slight shake reduction helps a little bit.

The air in the various cavities moves with this pressure wave.  If your mouth is closed the air in your ears and mouth cannot move freely and could rupture your eardrums.  In extreme cases, the air in your lungs could rupture your lungs.  Opening your mouth attempts to give this air a way to leave the body and minimize damage.   TL;DR: Minimizes chances of rupturing your eardrums."

shockwaveporn,32qb4q,snakesign,3,Wed Apr 15 23:43:50 2015 UTC,"Think of it as trying to manage 9 variables at the same time.  You have to make sure your position is on the landing pad at altitude 0, so 3 variables.  You have to make sure your speed is close to zero in the vertical as well as the horizontal, 3 more.  And you have to make sure your orientation is correct, 3 more.  You can see that it prioritizes in that order position, then velocity, then attitude.  It looks like it has to make a large position adjustment coming in.  This generates a large translation speed.  This in turn left a lot of lean as it touched down."

No it can't and it even says that in the article.  It is created in the transonic flight regime which is about Mach = 0.8 to about 1.2 Your source says that as well.  The condensation is caused by the pressure change resulting from a shockwave.  The thing is, you don't have to be flying supersonic to generate a shockwave.  When you are in the transonic flight regime, below Mach 1.0 the geometry of the aircraft can accelerate portions of the flow to supersonic speed, resulting in the shockwave and if the humidity is high enough a vapor cone.  You don't have to be supersonic, but a portion of the flow around your vehicle does.  Also, these can be formed if you are super sonic as well, since you will still be generating a shockwave."

shockwaveporn,30phv0,sineofthetimes,6,Sun Mar 29 19:43:27 2015 UTC,So how far away from the explosion is the camera?
shockwaveporn,30phv0,bargu,15,Sun Mar 29 20:56:58 2015 UTC,"It takes about 9 seconds to the shock wave hit, so assuming that the shock wave is moving at the speed of sound, about 3km"
shockwaveporn,30phv0,Fatalis89,4,Sun Mar 29 23:02:42 2015 UTC,"By definition, a shock wave moves faster than the speed of sound, so your estimate is unfortunately inaccurate.  A shock wave's Mach can vary pretty dramatically in fact."
shockwaveporn,30phv0,rspeed,3,Tue Mar 31 21:56:16 2015 UTC,"That would make it the minimum distance, anyway."
shockwaveporn,30phv0,Fatalis89,3,Thu Apr 16 00:46:10 2015 UTC,Sort of.  It is going to lose speed as it moves so for it to still be a shock wave by the time it gets to the caerman it would have to have been going well over Mach 1 upon detonation.
shockwaveporn,30phv0,rspeed,3,Thu Apr 16 00:52:58 2015 UTC,"Ah, true. I'm sure there's a formula to figure that out. Though 3 km was already a pretty rough estimate anyway."
shockwaveporn,30phv0,Fatalis89,-1,Thu Apr 16 01:16:34 2015 UTC,"There is most definitely a formula to figure it out, but you'd have to start by knowing the megaton yield of the explosive.    Calculated the shock wave a particular megaton nuke would produce once back during my undergrad but I don't even remember where to start with something like that.  It was something like Mach 13 I think, though this was no nuke and would surely be much less."

shockwaveporn,30j1h9,Sempais_nutrients,8,Sat Mar 28 01:01:59 2015 UTC,Sorry I'm dumb - how does it demonstrate this?
shockwaveporn,30j1h9,OstravaBro,24,Sat Mar 28 09:52:08 2015 UTC,"From http://www.waynesthisandthat.com/abombs.html  ""Nuclear detonations all experience a characteristic ""double flash."" Early in the detonation the explosion consists of two concentric spheres. The outer one is created by a sudden flood of radiation being absorbed by the surrounding air and heating it to incandescence. The inner one is the fireball of the vaporized solid elements of the bomb itself. The ionized structure of the outer shell makes it opaque to light from the inner shell so all that can be seen is the light the outer shell gives off. A millisecond or so after the detonation, the inner shell expands far enough that it blows through the outer shell and the glowing surface of the now exposed inner fireball can be seen, hence the second flash."""

shockwaveporn,30j1h9,RavenMJ74,5,Sat Mar 28 14:51:24 2015 UTC,"Vela Incident:       The Vela Incident, also known as the South Atlantic Flash, was an unidentified ""double flash"" of light detected by an American Vela Hotel satellite on September 22, 1979, near the Prince Edward Islands off Antarctica, which many believe was of nuclear origin. The most widespread theory among those who believe the flash was of nuclear origin is that it resulted from a joint South African and Israeli nuclear test.    The topic remains highly disputed today.  While a ""double flash"" signal is characteristic of a nuclear weapons test, the signal could also have been a spurious electronic signal generated by an aging detector in an old satellite, or a meteoroid hitting the Vela satellite. No corroboration of an explosion, such as the presence of nuclear byproducts in the air, was ever publicly acknowledged, even though there were numerous passes in the area by U.S. Air Force planes specifically designed to detect airborne radioactive dust. Other examiners of the data, including the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), and defense contractors, have come to the conclusion that the flash was not a result of a nuclear detonation.

shockwaveporn,2zw86d,slowly_going_south,9,Sun Mar 22 14:39:35 2015 UTC,"I used to design blast-resistant structures.  Shockwaves are just that, waves.  They will flow over and around things very  similar to the way water does.  They will curve around and spill over barriers and reform into more or less continuous waves over a fairly short distance (picture a similar barrier in the surf zone of a beach).  Thus, barriers like this do not necessarily protect you from the overpressures and underpressures caused by an explosion.  They will, however, protect you from the majority of the direct shrapnel.  How the shockwave forms and reforms is dependent on the speed of the explosive (high vs low, in layman's terms), air temperature, humidity, distance from detonation, the material the explosive is contained in, etc."

Conducted in northern Queensland, Australia by a joint Australian-American-British team, it was designed to simulate the effects of a nuclear weapon on tropical rainforest, using 50 tons of conventional explosive (TNT).  A device containing 50 tons of TNT was detonated to partially simulate a ten kiloton air burst in the Iron Range jungle of the Cape York Peninsula. The explosives were sourced from obsolete artillery shells and placed in a tower 42 metres (138 ft) above ground level and 21 metres (69 ft) above the rainforest canopy. After the explosion, troops were moved through the area (which was now covered in up to a metre of leaf litter), to test their ability to transit across the debris. In addition, obsolete vehicles and equipment left near the centre of the explosion were destroyed.  The explosion was intended by the Robert Menzies government to test and examine the feasibility of air burst nuclear weapons for clearing forests and the use of mangled forests to slow troop movement in South East Asia, primarily Indonesia and Malaysia in the escalation of the time against Sukarno and the Konfrontasi Malayan Emergency. There was also a view to use such techniques in the later Myanmar conflict and Vietnam War, which were simmering at the time.

shockwaveporn,2vgnos,Dilong-paradoxus,3,Wed Feb 11 01:38:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, after watching and studying atomic blasts, the only phenomena which I couldn't find a detailed explanation for was the double flash. Eventually I found the answer after digging through really technical sources with no images, so I made this album with actual pictures to greatly aid the explanation. As it so happens, this blast also produced a never before seen waveform called a precursor wave, which caused extensively more damage than predicted for its yield. I think it's interesting enough for another album, so maybe I'll make that next, now that I found out about this subreddit :)"

shockwaveporn,2vgnos,Dilong-paradoxus,1 point,Wed Mar 18 16:29:30 2015 UTC,"That's not an example of the double flash. You can see from the position of the wing that there is a cut to another camera in the video, probably to account for the abrupt change in exposure.  All of the material I have read doesn't imply that the double-flash is characteristic of a fusion explosion. This document makes no reference to any distinction between fusion and fission characteristics, and the example graph is from a 19-kiloton blast, which would be atypical of a fusion weapon."

shockwaveporn,2ven8d,c-fox,27,Tue Feb 10 10:55:24 2015 UTC,Something is weird here.  The shot before the blast and the shot immediately after is a different view: different houses.  I'm not at all saying this is faked in any sense.  It just seems like this was melded from two different cameras or from two different blasts.  I will go with the two different cameras.  I suspect one camera had a clear glass lens.  The second camera had welder's glass in front of it so the blast could be captured.  The second camera wasn't positioned exactly the same was as the first.
shockwaveporn,2ven8d,germanywx,18,Tue Feb 10 14:16:54 2015 UTC,"Definitely the same houses, just a different angle. Looks like it might be 2 cameras side by side.   Also, there is a short frame in there of a house up close. It's most likely just a GIF made from a video ""montage"" found online."
shockwaveporn,2ven8d,RaccoNooB,6,Tue Feb 10 15:09:43 2015 UTC,"I wonder what they made the casings out of for these cameras.  I would imagine some kind of kiln-dried earthen enclosure, like clay or something.  What could survive the heat and blast well enough to not damage 1940s/50s camera equipment?"
shockwaveporn,2ven8d,germanywx,8,Tue Feb 10 15:16:07 2015 UTC,A foot of steel.
shockwaveporn,2ven8d,Sempais_nutrients,3,Wed Feb 11 00:10:54 2015 UTC,Its because its from a second camera below the first set at a much lower exposure setting(controls how much light the camera takes in) thats why everything except stuff lighted by the bomb becomes so dark.
shockwaveporn,2ven8d,HampeMannen,-2,Sat Mar 14 20:35:26 2015 UTC,"That fits, because after the blast the daytime sky is blacked out."
shockwaveporn,2ven8d,Sempais_nutrients,6,Wed Feb 11 00:12:53 2015 UTC,How are the cameras unaffected by this ?
shockwaveporn,2ven8d,coffeeonsunday,8,Tue Feb 10 17:26:31 2015 UTC,I've always had this same question whenever I see videos like this.
shockwaveporn,2ven8d,SomeCollegeGuy,11,Tue Feb 10 17:28:25 2015 UTC,"I believe they are just very far away using impressive zoom lenses.  Alternatively, I guess you could put the actual camera buried underground then use mirror arrangement to capture the light ? That way the bit above ground gets destroyed but camera is fine ?"
shockwaveporn,2ven8d,OstravaBro,5,Tue Feb 10 19:20:54 2015 UTC,"Damn. I never thought about using mirrors, That's a great idea. I guess then all you'd need is the top periscope to be placed in insanely reinforced concrete or something similar."

shockwaveporn,2ven8d,Nemado,9,Fri Feb 27 14:42:21 2015 UTC,So I'm curious about why the dust is lifted up into the air before the shockwave even gets there. How can that happen?
shockwaveporn,2ven8d,RaccoNooB,30,Tue Feb 10 15:11:09 2015 UTC,Thermal radiation travels at the speed of light ahead of the shockwave. The dust (probably smoke) is the result of the heat cooking all of the surfaces.
shockwaveporn,2ven8d,jonjiv,20,Tue Feb 10 15:40:13 2015 UTC,Cool. Didn't know it was that intense.
shockwaveporn,2ven8d,RaccoNooB,14,Tue Feb 10 16:15:49 2015 UTC,You can see the smoke coming off the wires and telegraph poles before the shockwave hits.
shockwaveporn,2ven8d,SomeCollegeGuy,12,Tue Feb 10 17:07:50 2015 UTC,I think that's what the original comment was asking about.
shockwaveporn,2ven8d,Rye631,8,Tue Feb 10 17:28:03 2015 UTC,"My guess is that everything is essentially on fire that close to the explosion.  It isn't dust, just smoke."

shockwaveporn,2v9uv5,ThaBadmanPlace,2,Mon Feb 9 08:53:25 2015 UTC,Is anyone able to explain what the sounds are before the actual shockwave hits? you have that initial sound as the light from the explosion appears and then the classic huge muffled explosion noise followed by the bang! Is it the sound traveling through the ground?  Edit: Same explosion but the sound is a little better here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuQ5EPnSE_4
shockwaveporn,2v9uv5,elchet,4,Mon Feb 9 08:26:25 2015 UTC,"My guess is that it's the sound of smaller, earlier explosions reaching the camera position. Sound will travel a lot faster through solid objects, but I'm not sure this would account for these sounds."
shockwaveporn,2v9uv5,Huwbacca,3,Mon Feb 9 11:23:20 2015 UTC,I think it's just general other explosions or fighting... Maybe smaller explosions before /causing the main one. Either way they're not from the main explosion itself... They also aren't from conduction through the ground because they echo (Also as sound transfers between mediums it looses a LOT of energy)  Source: psychoacoustics is my job.
shockwaveporn,2v9uv5,BAXterBEDford,3,Mon Feb 9 19:48:39 2015 UTC,"Given that it was reported that it was a chemical plant that exploded, it could be some smaller explosions at the plant that led up to the big explosion but weren't visible from the distance of the camera.

It is effective against conventionally fuzed land mines and, when detonated, it provides a lane 8 meters by 100 meters. The MICLIC system consists of an M353 3½ ton or M200A1 2½ ton trailer (or M200 tracked trailer) chassis, a launcher assembly, an M147 firing kit, an M58A3 line charge and a 5-inch MK22 Mod 4 rocket. The line charge is 350 feet long and contains 5 pounds per linear foot of C-4 explosive. In the event a MICLIC fails to detonate normally, it can be manually activated by time-delay fuses every few feet along the length of it. Due to the inherent dangers of entering a live minefield to manually arm the backup fuses on a charge that could still detonate at any moment, possibly while under enemy fire as well, the act is jokingly referred to as the ""Medal of Honor run"".

shockwaveporn,2uvw26,BirdNerd90,3,Fri Feb 6 04:16:08 2015 UTC,"Not a dumb question at all.   The picture(Likely) turned out that well due to the camera being set to a fast shutter speed(The shutter speed is what controls how long the camera is taking in light when you press the button to when it actually takes the image. The higher the shutter speed the less light that is allowed to inter the lens. So a fast shutter speed is not good for low light situations, but it does help to capture good pictures of fast moving objects.). And also the person taking it was likely following the aircraft with the camera which will help compensate for the speed the aircraft is moving as well.   I'm certainly not an expert on the subject so I could be missing something but I do hope that helps you get at least a little better idea of it.

The imagery of bombs raining down into the forest, shockwaves marching through trees, dirt, and - hopefully - fortifications, and the enemy (those poor blighters!) is one of beautiful apocalyptic horror, a demonstration of pure destructive force. It is a show of unrestrained rampant energies approaching that of the forbidden atom, the ultimate of mankind's rage, which, if we do well and do not destroy ourselves, will surely yet be itself outdone.  The silence I find only underscores the otherworldliness of a scene made distant to comfortable modern life by time, peace, and failing that, the reduction of carnage, exploitation, and the mortal struggles of those not lucky enough to be born in the first world, into abstracted green night-vision fireworks and news bites of guerrilla attacks and troop surges. Imagine sitting in a tent, engaged as innocently as a prospective killer can be in the noble cause of defending your country and people, when, at the hands of people of similar mind but 20,000 feet or 9,000 miles away, people who happen to be much better equipped than you, the world is torn apart."

shockwaveporn,2t92wn,msanteler,57,Thu Jan 22 03:45:54 2015 UTC,"This technically doesn't count as a shockwave, as a vapor trail is something else entirely and extremely rare as far as I know, as the weather conditions have to be very much just right, not to mention the background has to be dark enough to see the trail. The vapor trail is caused by a drop in pressure behind the bullet which causes water in the air to condense momentarily, similar to those little white streaks at the tip of a jet's wing. I am fairly sure it is the rotation of the bullet through the air that causes this all to happen, as I said earlier, much like the vortices off an aircraft's wingtip. Also the pressure difference causes the air to be disturbed, causing a sort of shimmering effect around the path of the bullet.  I will keep this here though seeing as it is cool as fuck."

You get really good at looking for them if you shot long range a lot.   Frequently at above 500 yards trace is the easiest way to determine impact point and call a correction.   If you want to have a higher likelihood of seeing trace the best bet is to try and pick it up just as the bullet gets to the top of its flight path.   If you're acting as a spotter for a shooter, then you want to get your scope as close to the bore of the rifle as possible and defocus from the target to about 70% of the distance to the target.  It'll sharpen up the trace at the apex of bullet flight and make it easier to see.   That said, the first time I saw trace I said out loud holy shit, that's crazy!"

You might be able to see it better in the video  Also, spinning has no effect on jet formation from a shape charge. After the panels blow off, it's actually easier to see the continued spin of the entire round.

shockwaveporn,2s0bpu,nadromac,3,Sun Jan 11 08:16:28 2015 UTC,"13 years of identifying ordnance to keep myself and others alive?   First, and foremost, there is no sabot on that round. That alone eliminates it.  Secondly, the entire round is cylindrically shaped. APFSDS are darts with a sabot around the front third of the dart. Take a look at at this cut away. Notice how the sabot is cupped at the front? That's designed to catch the wind stream so the air will rip the sabot off. Look again at the gif, notice how it is streamlined? This would not work as a sabot round. Sure you're going to say ""what about those panels that blow off at the end?"" There is not benefit to having explosively removed panels on an APFSDS round, especially not that small. Typically, the only explosive in a APFSDS is the powder that kicks it out and sometimes a tracer element. APFSDS fins are fixed. The fins you see in the gif are fold out fins.    And lastly, it's just not. The round in this gif meets no identifier to be a APFSDS."

If, for whatever reason, they decided to try out a 118mm round they would still need a sabot to fire it from a 120mm cannon. A 1mm thick sabot would not offer enough drag to be reliably self-discarding, hence the panels blowing off.  Anyhow, you are definitely more knowledgeable about this than I am about this, so I will defer to your expertise and say this is most likely not a sabot.Thanks for answering my question."

Depending on the vehicle, this amount of explosive could be a catastrophic kill (everyone dies). *Remember, this estimate is based off of a small .gif so it's more of a guess based on the threat where these trucks are employed coupled with the explosion itself, I could be way off depending on a plethora of determining factors I don't have access to here.  Your standard landmine is about 10 - 20 lbs of explosive. Against armored vehicles these are more of a vehicle immobilizer than anything unless you get into specific mines with armor defeating characteristics.   So, to answer your question, this is the standard charge on most IEDs, but not most landmines"

shockwaveporn,2q5xvn,elchet,1 point,Tue Jan 6 23:34:31 2015 UTC,"Condensation cloud:       A transient condensation cloud, also called Wilson cloud, is observable at large explosions in humid air.  When a nuclear weapon or a large amount of a conventional explosive is detonated in sufficiently humid air, the ""negative phase"" of the shock wave causes a rarefaction (reduction in density) of the air surrounding the explosion, but not contained within it. This rarefaction results in a temporary cooling of that air, which causes a condensation of some of the water vapor contained in it. When the pressure and the temperature return to normal, the Wilson cloud dissipates.   Since heat does not leave the affected air mass, this change of pressure is adiabatic, with an associated change of temperature. In humid air, the drop in temperature in the most rarefied portion of the shock wave can bring the air temperature below its dew point, at which moisture condenses to form a visible cloud of microscopic water droplets. Since the pressure effect of the wave is reduced by its expansion (the same pressure effect is spread over a larger radius), the vapor effect also has a limited radius. Such vapor can also be seen in low pressure regions during high–g subsonic maneuvers of aircraft in humid conditions.

There was almost a ton (1600 lbs) of science investigation equipment onboard.  Imagine spending the past 5+ years of your life working hard (maybe overtime, weekends, holidays, summers, etc.) on a project just to watch it blow up on the launch pad.  Maybe your academic career / promotion / tenure depends on the results.  Maybe his engineering career is on the line.

It is very likely that dozens to hundreds of people spent a lot of time over the course of several years writing proposals, seeking grants, doing research, and meticulously putting that stuff together.  It's not easy to get an experiment on the space station.  If I were one of those people, I would be upset that I wasted all of those years working hard on a project through the launch date, only to see it all go up in a fireball.

B) EVEN if it were insured (it was not), the people in the video would not be the named beneficiaries of the policy.  C) Even if were insured (it was not) AND the guy in the video was the named beneficiary (he was not), there's still reason to be upset.  Money helps.

It was also referred to as Kuz'kina Mat' (Russian: Кузькина мать, Kuzka's mother),  referring to Nikita Khrushchev's promise to show the United States a ""Kuz'kina Mat'"" at the 1960 United Nations General Assembly. Developed by the Soviet Union, the bomb had the yield of 50 to 58 megatons of TNT (210 to 240 PJ).

It was originally intended for ""fire and forget"" use against mass formations of enemy armour, using a millimetre wave (mmW) seeker to ensure accuracy even against moving targets. Experience in Afghanistan led to the addition of laser guidance in the dual-mode Brimstone missile, allowing a ""spotter"" to pick out specific targets when friendly forces or civilians were in the area. The tandem shaped charge warhead is much more effective against modern tanks than older similar weapons such as the AGM-65G Maverick, while the small blast area minimises collateral damage. Three Brimstones are carried on a launcher that occupies a single weapon station, allowing a single aircraft to carry many missiles.

Our lab project was to calibrate we.  In order to get good pictures like this the light has to all be one wavelength and all moving in the same direction, so we shined a green laser through a couple lenses to spread it out over the whole viewing window.  The we put wedge in wind tunnel and fired it over a large range of initial PSIs.  We then measured the angle of the shock and in photographs and calculated the speed at each PSI.

shockwaveporn,25k1i8,i0dine,14,Wed May 14 18:10:26 2014 UTC,what are those dot-like artifacts in the explosion that appear within the first few frames?
shockwaveporn,25k1i8,RyonToyler,11,Wed May 21 21:23:14 2014 UTC,"I was wondering the same thing. I downloaded the gif so that I could look at it frame-by-frame. The first frame of the explosion looks almost like the sun in the sky. But the second one, where the fire ball is several times larger, the fire ball is significantly darker, as if there is almost some sort of skin around it. By the third frame it is looks almost as if the bright dots lift off of the surface of the dissolving skin. By the fourth frame the dots are almost completely gone. And by the fifth shot it looks pretty much like a larger version of the first frame.  Here's an album I made of those frames, for reference.  I'm guessing it is some sort of ionized gas around the ball of plasma, and maybe the dots are thin areas in the skin of ionized gas where the fire ball shines through more brightly. But I'm just spitballing here."
shockwaveporn,25k1i8,BAXterBEDford,4,Sat Aug 30 10:39:36 2014 UTC,It's actually artifacts in the film. Artifacts caused by the fact that those three frames had started to melt in the hundredths of a second it was exposed to the focused light from/during the hottest point of the blast.

shockwaveporn,21n2qz,BAXterBEDford,2,Sat Mar 29 13:54:36 2014 UTC,"""Refractive photography of the blast wave generated at the surface by detonation of a hemispherical 500-ton TNT charge, taken in July 1964 at the Canadian Defence Research Establishment (CDRE), Suffield, Alberta. The velocity of the blast wave was measured using cinematography, and the particle velocity using the smoke trail displacement technique. The white smoke trails were formed using cylindrical containers filled with titanium tetrachloride, which were projected from simple mortars. To improve the contrast of the photographic records, a black-smoke background was formed by burning crude oil. These data then allowed the determination of all other blast parameters as functions of time and radial distance.""  – Krehl, History of Shock Waves, Explosions and Impact (2009), p. 992."

shockwaveporn,1qqi59,GrizzlyLeather,3,Sat Nov 16 14:15:46 2013 UTC,How do they even make something like this that does not detonate when fired like that?
shockwaveporn,1qqi59,restricteddata,5,Sun Jan 26 04:15:43 2014 UTC,"It's not the additional damage, per se, but the fact that the reflected front and the shock front can, at different heights, be constructive. So you get a much bigger overpressure. Which means, in effect, that your overpressure range gets extended. Depending on what overpressures you are trying to maximize, there are different ideal heights of burst for making sure those wave intersect constructively at the right points. (Which is what results in the optimal-height curve as part of the standard ""knee curve"" of blast pressure.)"

shockwaveporn,1qlyas,ZuFFuLuZ,2,Fri Nov 15 01:58:11 2013 UTC,"They are under the ""rain"", so much further than 500-600 feet they can't be. The shockwave is almost instantaneous, about 150ms, another indicator they were too close. Detonation speed of ANFO is 4560m/s, even if you take half that speed for the shockwave (2280m/s which would be incredibly high) they'd still be only 345M or ~1130 feet away. Still way too close, especially for 50 pounds of that stuff, and it would have been buried in a very shallow hole, as you'd get way more sand in the air with a deeper hole. So no, I don't believe it's 50 pounds.    source: Been an engineer in the army for 2.5 years."
