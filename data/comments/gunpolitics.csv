Ah, so it's a repeat of the S&W/HUD agreement.  S&W learned hard from that agreement.  Dealers and distributors cancelled orders.  Sales plummeted.  To this day, I know people who won't buy a S&W product because of it.  What's more, the rest of the industry looked on while it happened.

The scariest thing about the NRA to them should be that ... their members are bona fide USA citizens and go to vote.   If the ultra-liberal gun-blamers want to try to shove legislation down our throats, they will have to face some angry voters.    and end their relationships with the small percentage of bad-apple dealers    This garbage again. Is this from some Bloomberg Mayors Against Second Amendment talking points memo?   The implied point is this is actually a problem. No mention of the existing federally-mandated background check system that  the Chattanooga murderer (let's not use his name) went through to get his gun of course.  The biggest problem is you can't just legislate and wish away crime, you have to get at the root of it instead of try to remove one of the tools it uses.    First, use federal purchasing power to begin a substantive conversation with gun manufacturers. The Pentagon is in the process of selecting the provider of handguns for the United States Army.   It should require all bidders to provide detailed information about their gun safety technologies and distribution practices in the civilian market. No response, no contract.    Yeah the armed services, FBI and other LEO agencies are going to jump all over those new technologies that make their guns ""safer"".   (To them, ""safer"" means, CAN'T FIRE)  Sure, they may toe the politicians line when it comes to making laws, but they're not idiots when it comes to firearm technology, since they, like the educated still-as-of-yet free men and women of this country, know that this ""gun safety"" technology actually imperils the user of the self-defense implement and the public whom he/she protects.  I totally agree though, let's go ahead and start with state and federal law enforcement agencies to set a good example. I'm sure they'll be totally open to implementing your ""gun safety""!  These guys really have a law to fix every problem.   I have an idea for smart gun technology, let's make a bullet that doesn't fire unless it's being shot lawfully!  Let's make it a law guys! For the children!    Second, work with companies to develop new models of distribution, such as through dealers certified by the industry as reputable.    Yeah. We should make them all sell to federally licensed dealers, who don't skirt the existing laws! Oh, wait...  ""Certified by the industry as reputable""... so basically federal law and bvackground checks don't work, let's entrust it to the gun manufacturers (the same ones who supposedly fund the NRA to make us all love guns and promote 'gun culture' and want to buy them! oops!!!!!)    Third, rescue the federal government’s smart-gun research efforts from oblivion. Tens of millions of research dollars are needed to help get promising safety technologies to market.    They really have no idea what they're talking about do they? Someone has drank the Kool-Aid....  Maybe we should address the root causes of crime instead of pretending the US population can be railroaded into gun bans like Australia or the UK?  I'd be unsurprised if these guys held stock in ""Smart Gun Technology"" companies.    Fourth, develop a set of metrics for measuring manufacturers’ performance. We might measure, for instance, the number of a manufacturer’s guns found at crime scenes, as a percentage of their overall sales.    I say we do the same with manufacturers of alcoholic beverages and vehicles whose products are found at fatal accident crime scenes.  If it saves just one life."

I also have a M1911, made in 1917 based on the serial number and colt's records but it was refurbed for WW2 (still all M1911 (no A1 or A2 parts) parts except for the front sight which I had to replace after the original flew off during fireing).

Moreover, there are a significant number of firearms in the system which are effectively untraceable via paperwork. They have to prove that that rifle, which you owned before the passage of I-594, didn't get sold until after the passage of I-594. They have to take the gun that hasn't had a paper trail since the 90s, and that guy is dead, and figure out who the last legitimate owner was. This isn't a law that enforces itself. In general, the only easily provable cases will already be covered under straw purchases - which was, is, and probably always will be, a felony. If I lived in Washington now, I might be unwilling to transfer a firearm to someone I didn't know well, but Joe Shmuck, whom I've known since I was ten?

gunpolitics,3dz98g,RebelRatel,-2,Tue Jul 21 10:41:49 2015 UTC,"2 years old is hardly out of date for polls like these.  views on things like UBC wouldn't be expected to vary wildly in 2 years, and historically they never do anywhere else, either.    although you're right in that the gun control lobby is agenda-driven.  in this case, they would like to see stricter regs enacted that control how guns are bought and sold in NV.  fair enough.    and in order to further their policy goals (ie, ""agenda""), they pay for independent polling companies to conduct polls which show pretty much exactly what they already knew they'd show:  that the American public, even in conservative states, even in rural areas of conservative states...support background check requirements for all gun purchases.    if you were right, and these polls are bogus, then the gun lobby would certainly have a direct interest in exposing this.  and they could easily do that by commissioning the same poll themselves, conducted by a different independent polling company.    so, why do you suppose the gun lobby hasn't done this?  what do you think is the most likely reason?  i think the most likely reason is that the polls aren't bogus, and the gun lobby knows it.  so their best bet is to just rely on people like you to run around the 'nets shouting about how you don't believe the Liberal Media.    which is fine by me, and will be even more fine when NV voters  vote in line with what the polls are telling us they want.  which is stricter laws about how guns are bought and sold.  the voters of a state deserve to have the gun laws they wish, and voter initiatives are the most direct expression of what the voters want.  even though, of course in NV, their elected representatives have already passed a bill.  so it's not even like their reps aren't repping for their constituents' desires.  which is even further support for the belief that voters will pass the initiative in 2016 when it comes up.    EDIT:  one caveat:  it's also a distinct possibility that, in order to save face before the 2016 elections in NV, that NV republicans will relent and the Gov will sign a bill before it comes up for a direct public vote.  if i was the R party in NV, that's what i'd do.  at this point it's pretty obvious that not only is it the will of the people, but they can't stave it off any longer since the signature collecting effort was a slam dunk and was the strongest showing for a voter initiative campaign in NV state history.  if R's just fight to the bitter end, it'll be pretty obvious to NV voters that the R's don't care about doing the People's business, and are just doing the manufacturing lobby's business.  that doesn't tend to go over well with voters anywhere, regardless of age race creed or party affiliation.  so i'd say get ready for a sudden about face on UBC by NV R's.  they'd be stupid not to."
gunpolitics,3dz98g,macksionizer,3,Tue Jul 21 16:24:56 2015 UTC,"Polling in a specific way after an emotionally charged event,  yep, great way to get solid information.   Your argument is full of unspoken assumptions and assertions.  You also are fond of ignoring the consequences of the officials that ignore their constituents actual wishes rather than astroturfing billionaires and leading polling.   Your misguided desire for universal background checks can only be executed three ways.    A registry to ensure that the transfer was done.  That is a non-starter, unless you want to compromise with removing all other restrictions and implementation of universal reciprocity.  Sting operations, much like we use for prostitution and drugs, which happen to be illegal.  So, some mental gymnastics are required to justify that, but you and your ilk are used to twisting like that.  The rest of us on the other hand will see it as a failure, much like the current war on drugs and such.  Not very successful.  Accept simple ""yes or no"" background check without firearm information, and trust your fellow citizens (whom you claim are all for this dog and pony show) to do what you claim they already support.   This would involve respecting your neighbors and trusting them, like they are law abiding citizens and not the thugs you wish would follow the laws already on the books.    Good on you, troll, you got a post out of me.  No crawl back to your hole over in that crap sub you came from."
gunpolitics,3dz98g,RebelRatel,-2,Tue Jul 21 16:48:57 2015 UTC,"re the registry, there are actually some leading gun regulation advocates that argue that a permit-to-buy program would be preferable to UBC.  the permit system would have less reliance on a registry.  so there's certainly room to work on the registry issue.  although with reference to UBC, i think you're right, that it pretty much requires a permanent registry to be useful.    but, luckily for the proponents of this NV effort, there are no federal restrictions on how long, or in what form, state agencies can retain their own background check system information.  so what we're seeing here is an accelerating trend among the states to pass their own UBC laws, by ballot initiative if need be.  and these state programs will include gun type, caliber, make/model, serial number etc.  eventually this serial number will also correspond to a mandated manufacturer database of unremovable microscopic ID markings that LEO has access to.  so there will no longer be any such thing as a gun made by a major manufacturer, and legally purchased in the US, which is ""untraceable"".  expect this to be just around the corner in Congressional bills on guns.  the gun lobby will fight it of course, but if Congress doesn't have the resolve to pass it, the states will just pass their own manufacturer mandates as CA is doing with microstamping requirements.  and just as emission standards for cars, as CA goes, so goes the nation.    as for the effectiveness of the law, the NV law will be effective in preventing private sellers from selling to anonymous local buyers without a check since it will make these sellers guilty of a serious offense if their buyer ends up doing something bad with the gun they sold them.  this is the goal of the program, and it will be successful without any additional active enforcement efforts on the part of LEO.  when a gun criminal is taken into custody, LEO analyzes his cell phone and computer records, subpoenas the service providers etc, and determines who the seller was.  they then arrest and convict the seller.    sure, high level gun traffickers and high level criminals will probably find ways to cover their gun dealing tracks, but that's only a small % of these people.  most such sellers will be easily identifiable.  which is why most private parking lot sellers will simply get out of the business, especially when they read in the paper about other gun flippers getting traced back and arrested.    it turns out, when you make an activity illegal, and provide a serious punishment for not stopping that activity...most people stop that activity.  it's not rocket science."

They are left with a horrible choice, vote against their own best interest to preserve the right to bear arms or vote in their best interest and sacrifice that right. I'm sure many just don't vote at all because of this. It's one of the problems with a two party system. There are only two extremes on major issues. There's no party willing to stand up for gun owners and the middle class."

At a certain point I'd much rather keep my 2nd amendment rights intact and figure out how to make my way in whatever socially unjust world exists out there while doing what I can on a personal level to combat injustice.    I can help out poor people and disenfranchised urban youth, I can help out gay people who want equality... I can help womens rights...  I can do all that stuff on my own and contribute to huge activist groups who push solely for those things...     I can't get my gun rights back if they're taken away from me by the current crop of politicians who want them gone for good. No matter how much money I pour into the NRA or any other activist group.  The anti's have learned their lesson.... If they get it through... the next AWB won't have a sunset provision... then it's on to the next, and on to the next, until we've got nothing left and the fight to get our rights back can't be supported by a growing community of shooters and gun owners because that growth has been thoroughly stamped out by regulation."

Just like Democrats are good at faking being antiwar.     It also applies if race is removed from the equation.    Of course.  It's a socioeconomic thing.

gunpolitics,3dhugv,ChopperIndacar,2,Thu Jul 16 17:46:17 2015 UTC,The party that supports gun control does so specifically to oppress minorities. It's the very reason open carry is now frowned upon by so many and illegal in many states. Democrats always have been the party of oppression and continues to be the party of oppression.  Minorities who don't support the second amendment don't support civil liberties. It's sadly hypocritical. I wish minorities would take their rights back. I honestly have trouble with the notion so many fought so hard to have a generation or two later bend over to surrender some of those very same rights.
gunpolitics,3dhugv,verdantmiles,2,Fri Jul 17 04:36:50 2015 UTC,"The reason I carry is to defend myself against people who have decided that they don't want to work inside the system to get what they want. And if I have to do that, I have a fairly decent chance that the system will back me up.  If I was more worried about the system itself, I'm not sure I would carry.

On top of that, it gives you a social connection to smart cops who also carry every day and could be a gun guy just like us.

gunpolitics,3df158,shots-o,4,Thu Jul 16 16:27:48 2015 UTC,Yes. They literally believe the only reason to carry a gun is because you want to go out and kill someone at the slightest provocation.

They actually believe other people fantasize about killing because that's what the anti rights people do.  Sadly their hate of rights comes from their own mental illness.  This is why they are so hostile about the mental health problem.  They are in denial of their own handicap because of the great stigma mental problems has in this country.  If we were somehow to fix mental health.  The anti rights people would feel comfortable enough to seek treatment, and would cease their hatred of the rights of the people."
gunpolitics,3df158,SniperGX1,2,Thu Jul 16 00:14:59 2015 UTC,"The point is not to show a causation of concealed carry permits lowering murder. The point is to disprove the claim that more carry permits lead to higher murder rates (""blood in the streets"" arguments).  Causation requires correlation. Without even correlation, a causation argument falls flatly on its face."
gunpolitics,3df158,OnNom,5,Fri Jul 17 18:20:22 2015 UTC,"In which case you'd want to take the overall national trend in decreasing violent crime (including murder) to predict what you would expect the drop in murder rate to be and then see if the prevalence of concealed carry permits resulted in a drop that differed from expectations.  There are other counfounding factors that might mess up that comparison, of course.   People who live in areas with higher-than-average crime rates might be more inclined to want to be able to protect themselves, for instance.  Or people with higher incomes being more likely to buy/carry guns and, relatedly, living in wealthier and safer neighborhoods.  Ultimately, though, this type of argument is pointless.   You could show that a fundamental human right was absolutely abused by a small number of individuals, but that would not justify restricting it."
gunpolitics,3df158,Cthulhumanism,2,Fri Jul 17 23:34:52 2015 UTC,"And in big cities where concealed carry is illegal and gun laws already exist, murder rates are going up.

gunpolitics,3df158,Sumner67,6,Wed Jul 15 23:37:38 2015 UTC,"That's probably overstating it. New Orleans, Alaska and Milwaukee all have comparatively lax gun laws and high gun crime rates. I'd like to think more guns lead to less crime, but the only conclusions I can fairly draw are that (i) lax local gun laws are not a necessary or sufficient condition for a high crime rate, and (ii) strict local gun laws are not a necessary or sufficient condition for a low crime rate."

gunpolitics,3df158,IAmWhatYouHate,2,Thu Jul 16 17:29:45 2015 UTC,"Perhaps if that was the only different factor, but we all know that's far from the case."
gunpolitics,3df158,CBruce,2,Thu Jul 16 14:35:28 2015 UTC,but an armed populous is one of if not THE biggest factor that anti gun people don't want to accept. Even criminals admit that they will steer clear of a victim if they think or know that they are armed and will likely fight back.
gunpolitics,3df158,Sumner67,3,Thu Jul 16 16:09:00 2015 UTC,"I don't put much stock into any wide-scale effect of firearm ownership on violent crime. Sure, in the one-on-one encounter, it can make all the difference in the world. But the majority of criminals aren't privy to knowledge about whether or not the person they're attacking or home they're burglarizing is armed. Obviously, it's just human nature to opt for low-risk targets. But criminals aren't stupid. If they pick their time/place and gain better rewards for the same risk, or just gamble on leveraging the element of surprise, they'll do that. A firearm doesn't mean a whole lot if step one is being clubbed in the back of the head when you're not paying attention.   You could conjecture that if they know, they'll always avoid it. But on the other hand you could just as easily conjecture that if they know a homeowner is armed, they'll simply wait until that person isn't home. Or worse, specifically target that house with the intent of taking those firearms for themselves.  Now maybe if everyone was armed, things might be different. But that's just not reasonable. It's as unrealistic as a world where no one is armed. The more realistic scenario seems to be a world where no one's sure who is armed, and everyone treats everyone else as if they are by default. Then again, this seems to be the default stance of law enforcement, and that has lead to numerous incidents of justified shootings of unarmed people, because an officer believed that their target was armed and acting in a manner that was a threat to their lives. Is that because of human nature or specific training that cops go through. I can't say. But something to consider.  None of that is meant to disparage the right to own arms or to carry them for self defense. I don't believe there's any correlation with lawful, responsible carrying of firearms and any increase in unjustified assaults/homicides. If anything, evidence suggests the latter: people who go through some sort of process to obtain a permit to carry a firearm in public appear to be very reticent to actually use one.  This is one of the reasons why 'constitutional carry' makes me a bit nervous. There does appear to be a benefit to having a 'permit' process and I'd love to see some system that allows anyone to exercise the right to 'bear arms'--ideally completely unburdened--while still giving them the benefits of the requisite training and certification of a formalized permit process.  That's a fine line to walk though, and is just as likely to be used by anti-gun proponents as a means of getting a foot into the door and leveraging that position for more draconian measures."

gunpolitics,3ddjla,dan121,13,Wed Jul 15 12:47:56 2015 UTC,"Christians claim to follow Jesus, the man who commanded us to “love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,” (Mat. 5:44) and “do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.” (Mat. 5:39)   I wish this particular argument would die, but it never will.  In Matt 5:38-42 says:   38 “You have heard that it was said, ‘Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.’ 39 But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also. 40 And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well. 41 If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles. 42 Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.   Now, you should note that all three cases (slap, coat, and walking) have something in common, they are all insults and non-life threatening attacks.   The ""slap on the right cheek"" in a culture of mostly right handed people means that it is a backhanded blow, one that is insulting, but not deadly or intended as a precursor to a deadly attack.  The suing for a shirt is a reference to Jewish jurisprudence which guaranteed certain inalienable rights, one of which was basic clothing. Under Jewish law, a lawsuit could take your coat as a pledge (to be returned during the night), but could not take your shirt. This says a lot about how Christians should respond to malicious, frivolous lawsuits, but nothing about self defense against a deadly threat.  Lastly, the ""go two miles"" is a reference to a Roman carry over of a Persian law. Basically, a Roman soldier could press a person into service to carry his load for one mile. In the face of brutal Roman occupation, this law caused much resentment, but here Christ preaches not only compliance, but extra duty. Again, this may urge Christians not to complain about the DMV, but it does not say anything about resisting deadly attack.  In short, there is nothing here that speaks to how a Christian should or should not resist a potentially deadly attack."

Part of the ""conservative"" includes, in their minds, religious. That's really all there is to this one. It's not so much based on fact as it is based on the image they are trying to portray.  Plus, a lot Americans do identify as Christian. So by claiming that Christians can't own guns, they are painting a large part of the population as hypocrites. That benefits the antis in two ways:   They might actually convince a few people. Probably not many, but still. They are already demonizing gun owners.

""Unless you're stupid or lying, you'll agree with me that...""    no rights are absolute.  all rights have limits.  the right to bear arms was limited even in the time of the Founders, btw.  no less than Mr Olde Tyme Originalist himself, Antonin Scalia, mentioned in a 2013 interview with Chris Wallace that in colonial times, it was a punishable crime to walk around in public for no good reason with unusual weapons that scared people.  it was apparently called ""frighting"".    so gun rights have always had limits, especially in public spaces.  but this is something you'd never know if you were fed on a steady diet of writings like OP.  many of the author's bold-sounding arguments fall apart or look silly if you actually put them into a full historical context.  which of course is why he avoids a full historical context."

All that matters is the language in the Bill of Rights.  The spirit it completely clear.    I, personally, wouldn't carry an AR-15 to the mall, and I don't want others to do it unless they have some particular reason, but the last way that we should address the immaturity of those who do it is legislating against it.  Rather, the mall managers, the friends/families/teachers/coaches/pastors of that AR-15 toter, etc. should help evolve that person's maturity and judgment.  America has an immaturity problem, in these regards.  Guns make it acute, but you can't legislate maturity/morality by going after the guns. The immaturity that you bring to the equation is to go after the guns by wanting to yank liberties.  You yourself are very immature - your language and attitude, here, have revealed that time after time.  So you are the 'equal and opposite' side of this whole fucked up equation.  Certain forms of open-carry result from immaturity on one side, and the other side reacts with their immaturity by trying to ban that behavior. This is why we make little progress as a society.  You are a part of the problem, and the meta-problem here is that you think you're not.    What's crucial for our society is to retain the liberties that we have which are not inherently wrong/bad/dysfunctional.  If we are abusive of those liberties, because we are immature (for example), then we go after the abuse, by going after what sponsors the abuse.  Short-cutting to the 'symptoms' of the 'disease' is more attractive to a juvenile problem-solving paradigm, because it's easier and more obvious and appeals to strong emotions by providing a more direct outlet for any given outrage, but it won't actually be successful AND it's ethically wrong (because curtailing liberties is not Progress). Mankind needs to finally address the core problems that we have, which sponsor our various dysfunctions.  But that's going to need to be a holistic approach, and that's a ton of work, and at this point we're almost a 'tear-down' vs being something that we can just keep 'patching'. The gun-control / gun-rights issue is a classic/perfect arena for this conundrum, because it represents one of the most emotionally triggery issues that society suffers, yet is one of our most crucial liberties to retain. Prohibition didn't work for how problematic booze was/is, and it's not going to work for our gun-violence problems."

gunpolitics,3dam0g,reddit_is_filth,4,Tue Jul 14 20:06:48 2015 UTC,"My understanding (and Im not 100% on this, I havent been following the story that closely) was that he had a previous bust for drug use/possession that SHOULD have come up during the NICS background check.    Basically the FBI has 3 days from the initiation of the background check to find out if the person is prohibited from owning a fire arm. If they cant find any reason within 3 days, the owner gets the gun on the 4th day. The FBI didnt start his background check until the 2nd day, so despite Roof having been charged with felony possession, he was able to buy the gun.  The charge was in a small town adjacent to Columbia and the FBI didnt receive any information back from them by the 3rd day of the background check.   Basically because of poor record management and bureaucratic mismanagement, a person who should have been flagged in NICS, wasnt and was able to get the gun despite being flagged for substance abuse.

gunpolitics,3dam0g,gumbii87,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:54:36 2015 UTC,"I think the more pressing question is does his prohibiting crime have a strong correlation with future mass murder? Possession of Suboxone doesn't in any way correlate with violent racism or the desire to harm others that I can see. One instance of both does not make it any sort of rule.  There's this pervasive belief that if we could just somehow magically keep every prohibited person from getting a gun, that we'd have far fewer murders and mass shootings. Asides from the implausibility of such a thing ever happening, it seems to me that the vast majority of prohibited people would probably never commit a violent crime anyway. Add to that the number of violent people who haven't been caught, prosecuted, convicted, and prohibited yet, the relative handful of people who slip through the cracks like Dylann Roof did, all those people who legally purchased a gun, became prohibited, but are still in possession...and the whole system seems to be not much more than a feel-good measure. Something that suggests the government is in control because 'something' had to be done."

So everyone should just be willing to accept the risk of being raped, beaten, stabbed, shot, or 'just' roughed up in their own home on the off chance that merely having a gun makes them somehow more likely to want to kill themselves?  What the hell kind of fucked up reasoning is that? I am keenly aware of my own sense of self destruction. If you personally are at all unsure of your suicidal tendencies, you might want to seek professional counseling about that. By all means, put off buying that firearm until you get that sorted out.   The police make situations worse with their guns all the time. If these trained professionals can't handle carrying guns without killing unarmed individuals, what makes you think Joe Schmo the high school dropout will do better?   Because unlike cops interacting with people in public, once a person crosses the threshold of your home that's an entirely different matter. Unarmed or not it is a reasonable assumption that person(s) who break into your home are intent on doing bodily harm. Especially if said person(s) knows that you are home, but does not opt to immediately leave.  Now if you want to wax poetic about the virtues of the castle doctrine, duty to retreat, ""warning shots"", exactly under which circumstances lethal force if justified, that's a separate argument. I believe in having the option and not exercising it is better than not having the option at all.  As for citizens carrying in public, well statistics demonstrate that those with permits to do so are less likely to shoot anyone than the general public or police. So to me, that's a pretty positive endorsement."

I'd like to point to the suicide rate in Japan 18.5 per 100,000 in comparison to the US 12.1.  Also the Suicide rate among MEN in the UK is 19.0 per 100,000... and has been rising steadily since the 2000s...  and yet gun ownership remains as heavily restricted there as its ever been and firearm suicides are an incredibly small fraction of the total."

Meanwhile, the city has suffered legal losses in its efforts to keep guns out of the hands of residents and seen its attempts to stiffen gun laws thwarted by state lawmakers.

gunpolitics,3d4qpq,Frostiken,-10,Mon Jul 13 17:19:45 2015 UTC,"those rules were made specially for the /r/gunnut serial overposters, as the rules page explains.  and they know exactly who they are.    but that's the beauty of reddit:  it's not a court of law, and it's not a suicide pact, so you don't have to put up with people seeking to subvert the operation of your thread if you don't want.  you just boot them out.  GrP has plenty of frequent pro-gun posters who can stay and post as much as they want.  these guys are allowed to stay because they aren't serially posting the same xeroxed bullshit talking points.  if what you have to say is original, and isn't over the top abusive, then it doesn't matter how lame or pro-gun you stuff is.  the rules you cite weren't made to keep all gunners out.  just the ones doing the behavior in question which clogs/bogs down the activity of the sub as a whole.  which is just good administration, really."

We don't like it, but basically the behavior of rural gun owners is responsible for the policy.""  Those rules have been up there for years. ""Temporary"" doesn't usually mean ""several years"".  Add to this the fact that your own ruleset can't even manage to scrape enough professionalism to not resort to name-calling, and it makes for a very hilarious and yet very depressing subreddit."

I'm starting to wonder if there's some connection between being anti-gun and being a lawyer or something. You people seem to really love your technicalities.      one man's ""technicality"" is another man's simple clarity of language.  but if you're wondering, no, i'm not a law-talkin'-guy by trade.  although as groups of people go, lawyers are much better trained than the avg person to be able to think critically and to use language carefully.    also, since most of the gun debate actually does center around laws, or proposals for new ones, it makes sense that a lawyerly approach to it will prevail.  since it's about laws, not about ""feels"" as you guys like to say.     Pro-gun posts aren't banned, you just can't post more than once every 24 hours.     sure you can, you just can't spam or be abusive.  that gets you banned.  and if you've spammed or been abusive in the past, they might let you back in with a 24-rule stipulation.  but again, GrC is explicitly a place for gun regulation advocates to romp around.  that's it stated purpose.  there are way more explicitly pro gun sites than on the pro reg side, so you don't really have room to bitch.  it's my suspicion that gunners only walk around whining about GrC's sub rules because GrC is just a much more interesting, dynamic, and entertaining sub than all the other pro gunner subs combined.  so everybody wants in.  everybody always wants into where the smart stuff is going on, even if they can't keep up.  so i get it.  but again...explicitly pro reg.  by design.  from the beginning.  take it or leave it.  welcome to Reddit.     It really fits in with the whole anti-gunner mindset of making gun ownership so extremely expensive and arduous that, while you can TECHNICALLY own guns, nobody wants to go to the trouble of doing it.     not at all sure how this comment ""fits in"".  but, when you do want to express this sentiment, please try to be more specific.  are you talking about UBC?  permit proposals?  most serious pro reg commentators tend to favor particular proposals, so you'll do well to address those specifically if you don't want to be dismissed as too vague to be taken seriously.    LPT:  just throwing out the standard slippery slope fear isn't a rational argument.  in fact, it's literally the name of an informal fallacy of argument.  so best to avoid that, even if it's on your mind.  unless you actually want to say something like, hey i have this fear, can anybody speak to it objectively?  which of course never happens, for the same reason that conspiro nutters don't ask for this.  because they've built their whole mental construct around a system where any suggestion to the opposite of their deep dark fears is immediately seen simply as further evidence of the vast conspiracy they see themselves fighting against.  so enlarging their thought bubble to consider other possibilities would let enough sunlight in that they'd become fully aware of how nutty they were.  which isn't really their thing.     Just because you're not calling it a ban doesn't mean it isn't a ban.     you can't spam or be really abusive.  other than that, you're welcome to post in GrC.  if you routinely overpost with comments that are anti-X, on a sub explicitly created as a forum for people who are like X, then that's trolling.  and GrC might well ban you for that too.  which, again, if i made a habit of trolling around on r/progun just saying ""whatever gunner nutjob"", ""says you, ammosexual"", etc, then i'd expect to get banned, cuz explicitly pro-whatever sub.  this is why i'm continually amused by certain gunners on GP who think they're making an accurate statement by calling me a troll for making explicitly pro reg comments on gunner posts here in GP.  i'm not trolling, because this isn't an explicitly pro gun sub.  if it was, then yeah, i'd be trolling.  or if i routinely came out of nowhere to say pointedly mean things.  that's actually something that happens to me routinely on GP.  not something i routinely do.  which is why i haven't been banned.  cuz i haven't done anything to deserve it.  if you have a problem with any of this, or you disagree and think that GP somehow actually is explicitly for pro gun commentary, then take that up with the GP mods.  they'll set you straight on that."

I may downvote, but I've never been part of an organized effort to do so. Also, the rules don't say anything about downvoting being a banable offense, so I didn't ask for the ban.

gunpolitics,3d4qpq,TotesMessenger,21,Mon Jul 13 14:56:39 2015 UTC,"Summoned.  So a little about me: I did data science for the armed forces, but I do it now for healthcare customers.  So yeah, the JH study has two serious design decision infractions that I consider decidedly odd.    1) Limiting the time domain to center around 1995 and bounded, when there's more than enough UCR, P30/P60, Census, GSS, etc datasets to go around.  I was able to get mine to go back to ~1969 and as far forward as ~2010 when I attempted to replicate their results.  In fact, I noted that the ""reduction"" in homicides actually completely disappears in a few years, and their synthetic control would match the actual results.  The implication here is that permit-to-purchase only works for a few years before it loses its effect, a lot like if you take steroidal treatments too regularly.  2) The reliance on Rhode Island and New Hampshire in their synthetic controls is not particularly robust.  I was able to replicate their ""reduction"" out of sample when I manually limited by vector to their synthetic control states, but when I constructed my own control using high dimensional feature selection (gamma lasso is love, gamma lasso is life), I found that, strangely, Georgia was a better control state.  And for CT, using a broader state mix in a similar fashion, my estimate was more in line with the reality out of sample.  If I applied the same methodology they used to other states, I found utterly ridiculous results.  For instance, using their design, it predicted that gun control was responsible for a 50% increase in homicides in Utah.  That's not a reliable result and neither is the CT study.      Between those two points, if I were generous, I would say that permit to purchase is a one-time deal, and with unpredictable performance as the results aren't particularly portable.  I'd be more than happy to send along my CSVs and R code so you can mess around with it on your own."

The language of the law that categorizes as Prohibited Persons anyone ""who is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance"" is almost impossibly vague. The law offers absolutely no guidance beyond that one quoted sentence fragment above, so it's basically been a game for the last 50 years where the executive branch (ATF, FBI) play it as ""we know it when we see it, so fuck you"" and the courts either go along with it, or on some occasions point out where chunks of that ""definition"" are unconstitutionally vague. The ""addicted to"" clause has been basically been tossed entirely because it has absolutely no clear legal meaning. ""Unlawful user of"" has likewise been severely limited in court only to cases where the state can prove that the defendant has a pattern of use. There's even been a case where a convicted carjacker who admitted to having smoked a joint just before the carjacking had his conviction under 18USC922(g)(3) overturned because a single admission of smoking pot was not enough to show a pattern of use. What it has come down to is that prosecutorially, the only standard that has passed judicial muster has been:  a conviction for use or possession of a controlled substance within the past year, or multiple arrests for such offenses within the past five years if the most recent arrest occurred within the past year.  The problem is that the above is basically internal policy intended to guarantee conviction, and isn't actually codified in any way. As a result, unless the matter is actually going to end up in front of a judge they're free to play the ""we know it when we see it"" game. As far as NICS goes, that's we know it when we see it. With the rise of widespread state level legalization of marijuana, this kind of seriously subjective enforcement needs either clarifying law, or a good SCOTUS smackdown. Unfortunately, I don't predict either. The combination of support for drug decriminalization and gun rights just is not represented by any but a handful in government."

That's a fundamental shift from proving someone is guilty and shouldn't be able to exercise a right to proving that everyone is innocent before they exercise a right.  Nevermind that there was exactly 2 months between when he purchased the gun and when he used it. If the FBI had information that the sale should have never occurred, they could have followed up, gotten a warrant for the record of sale if need be, gone to his house, and demanded that he surrender it. Or arrest him for being a prohibited person in possession of a firearm. But they didn't. They mucked this one up and now want to blame the 3 day limit instead of the failings within the system itself.  No telling how many prohibited buyers slip through the crack like this, the vast majority of them never going on to commit a crime.

The F.B.I. did not give the dealer the authority to proceed with the purchase because the bureau said it needed to do more investigating of Mr. Roof’s criminal history, which showed he had recently been arrested.""    I was under the impression that when you go buy a gun from a dealer they call up an automated system that gives them a YES or a NO based on a simple metric of having felony convictions or mental-holds. But this article makes it sound like there are investigators doing case-by-case treatments of these checks.  Wtf?  Is that real? Some FBI clerk is going to pull up local arrest records to see if there are 'currently-in-process' drug possession charges?  Wtf?

It says ""number of women who owned a firearm jumped"" but then gives that in a percentage.  It did not say the percentage of women increased...  So, just giving some numbers to the example.  Lets say there are 1000 women in the world.  So 11% would be 110 women gun owners in 2004.  And, 23% in 2011 would be 230 women.  So, the number of women that entered the gun culture would have been 230-110, or 120 women.  120 women is 109% of 110 women.  But, if the article said the Percentage of women gun owners increased from 11% to 23%, your 12% would be correct.  (However, stating it this way would usually be the author using poor wording because he/she didn't really understand the underlying concepts begin discussed, or deliberately trying to downplay the fact that there are now over twice as many women gun owners as in 2004.)

Anyone that says that is actually saying that somehow the maker of an object has magically imbued his wish and desire into a piece of metal that can somehow force another person who touches it to magically use that object in the way the maker wants it used.   Oh, and as a firearms instructor I can tell you bluntly that in my home the bat and knives are FAR more dangerous than my guns, because my guns are locked up or on my person. Anyone can open a drawer and grab a knife in the kitchen or the bat in the closet.

Technically, even though you're obnoxious, you're right when saying that guns are involved in more fatalities than pools.     However  Pools are involved in the death of more kids than guns..."
gunpolitics,3cgfa7,Archr5,-2,Wed Jul 8 12:47:05 2015 UTC,"the word ""kids"" can mean different things.  it could mean ""minor"", ie less than 18, or it could mean under 15, or it could mean little kids, like under 5.  but in general, if somebody says ""kids"", i think under 15 is probly a pretty reasonable way to interpret that word.  so, here is swimming pool drownings vs firearm-related deaths for under 15yo:  CDC says firearm-related death rate for Americans under <15 years old is 1.66/100k.  Swimming pool drowning rate/100k in <15 year-olds is much less than 1.66.  i didn't do that math, but you can see from the bars on the chart that the M+F 1-4 yo is right around 1.5, and that's by far the highest subset of 0-14.  none of the other age groups are above 0.3, so therefore the whole group of 0-14 is going to be much lower than 1.5.    Bottom Line:  according to CDC's numbers, more American kids age 0-14 die in firearm-related deaths each year than drown in swimming pools."
gunpolitics,3cgfa7,macksionizer,3,Wed Jul 8 15:48:51 2015 UTC,It's apples and oranges.   Doctors aren't asking if you have guns in your house because they're likely to be involved in a homicide that kills your kids.    So lets take out homicides from your CDC number.    Ages 0-4  Suicide rate: 0.   unintentional rate .15 intention undetermined .01         Total for Ages 0-4   rate = .16   Ages 5-14 Suicide: .49   Unintentional .46 Unknown .06   total for ages 5-14  1.01   Plus 0-4     1.17...

He can impart useful information on common household hazards without having to ask a list of questions.  This is especially valuable because if he covers them all, if they obtain those risk factors later (like installing a pool or buying a gun) then they already know the precautions.

Particularly when viewed relative to the global decline in violent crime and homicide that nearly every country, including the US, has seen over that period of time.  The unspoken fact about guns in the UK is that if they're not a problem now (because their homicide rate is relatively lower than the US), then they were never a problem to begin with. Because they're homicide rate has always been lower relative to the US, and banning handguns did not result in some new murder-free Utopian state.  In fact, the opposite happened. The UK saw an increase in homicide rate for a number of years immediately after banning handguns and it remained at elevated rates for over a decade. During the same period of time in the US, the homicide and violent crime rate plummeted from it's unusually high state during the early to mid 90s. All of which corresponded with a general loosening of gun restrictions.  Am I suggesting that looser gun laws in the US caused a decline in homicides? Of course not. I'm suggesting that the true cause of violent crime and homicides has for more to do with other factors that changed during that time period. Is it a coincidence that the homicide rate peaked during the 'crack epidemic' and height of the 'war on drugs' in the US? Most people seem to believe otherwise..."

gunpolitics,3cfly6,indgosky,4,Wed Jul 8 03:33:03 2015 UTC,"tl;dr: It would appear the UK does, in fact, adjust homicide figures downward to exclude justificable homicides and non-convictions, upwards of 13-15% of the actual homicide rates.  After further research, I believe there is sufficient evidence to show that that UK does, in fact, adjust homicide figures downwards, effectively nullifying any efforts to compare UK homicide rates to US homicide rates.  /u/plumb0b posted this rebuttal to my original posting:   Edit: It appears this claim is not true. According to this UK gov source, conviction status of the 551 homicides in 2012 is as follows:  Of the 551 cases currently recorded as homicide in 2012/13, data on the case outcomes of the principal suspects at 8 November 2013 showed (Appendix table 2.02 (1.38 Mb Excel sheet) ): court proceedings had resulted in homicide convictions in 219 cases (40%); court proceedings were pending for 209 cases (38%); proceedings had been discontinued or not initiated or all suspects had been acquitted in 18 cases (3%); suspects had committed suicide in 17 cases (3%); and no suspects had been charged in connection with 88 cases (16%).  So it appears that even if no suspects are in custody, a homicide is still counted as a homicide.  http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/crime-stats/crime-statistics/focus-on-violent-crime-and-sexual-offences--2012-13/rpt---chapter-2---homicide.html?format=print     I took the liberty of contacting the editor of American Thinker with these concerns, who in turn contacted the author.  I received the following response (I didn't get permission to reproduce his response verbatim, but will paraphrase the salient points):   ""Since 1967, homicide figures for England and Wales have been adjusted to exclude any cases which do not result in conviction"" (source: http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmselect/cmhaff/95/95ap25.htm)   Additionally, the author supplied this link that claims to show that the repoted UK homicide rates is higher than officially reported, upwards of 50%.  He did edit his post to remove the ""50% higher"" reference since the official UK record (noted above) cites a figure of 13-15%."

gunpolitics,3cfly6,ZeroSumHappiness,3,Tue Jul 7 15:39:34 2015 UTC,"The US rate of firerarm homicides is 3.5/100K (as of 2013).  The reported rate of UK firearm homicides is .97/100K (as of 2013).  Adjusting that figure upwards by 15%/50% gives us 1.16-1.46/100K.  Note that reported homicides by firearms in the US is not weighted by population distribution.  Homicide by firearms in urban areas is nearly twice that of rural areas. There is an approximately 80/20 split in the urban/rural population of the US.  The most urban population centers were found to have nearly 3 times the rate of homicide by firearms deaths than less urban and rural areas of the US.  Clearly, lowering deaths by firearms should focus on those cities which seem to have the most problem with enforcing the laws already on the books.  Good luck finding a single anti-gunner who will acknowledge this discrepancy.  To do so would undermine their ultimate goal of  a total firearms ban."

gunpolitics,3cfly6,billyhorton,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:04:17 2015 UTC,"But it's still an official UK publication.  Also:   The WFSA at its annual general meeting in Nuremberg, Germany, on March 12, 2009, presented its prestigious Shooting Ambassador Award to Colin Greenwood of the United Kingdom. A former Coldstream Guardsman who spent five years in the army, Colin Greenwood went on to serve as a policeman in West Yorkshire, England, and retired as a Superintendent after 25 years’ service. While a Chief Inspector, he won a research fellowship at Cambridge University Institute of Criminology where he studied the development of firearms legislation in Britain, on which was based his well-known book ‘Firearms Control’ (1972). Its penetrating critique of the origins and inadequacies of British firearms legislation was groundbreaking and remains a key reference in the discussion of firearms ownership and the shooting sports in Britain. He wrote ‘Police Firearms Training’ in 1966 and ‘Police Tactics in the Use of Firearms’ in 1969. Following his strong interest in antiquarian arms and collecting, his most recent publication is ‘The Classic British Rook & Rabbit Rifle’ (2006). He has been a consultant to the Shooting Sports Trust and the Gun Trade Association, and through these two bodies a contributor to the work of the British Shooting Sports Council. He has had wide interest in and experience of shooting since childhood, including target rifle, clay target and pistol, and he represented the British Police in the European Police Pistol Championships. He has shot large and small game and is a keen deer stalker and handloader. He has worked as a forensic firearms expert and court expert witness. After retirement from the police, he edited the British shooting and firearms magazine ‘Guns Review’ for many years. With his strong background in research, he continues to write today. The shooting community of the UK and the Commonwealth owes Colin Greenwood a huge debt of gratitude. His knowledge, research and his often-published forthright insistence on the truth have been deployed time and again in defence of lawful civilian firearms owners. In receiving this WFSA Ambassador Award, he joins African novelist Wilbur Smith, Sir Jackie Stewart (UK), Torben Espensen (Denmark), Garry Breitkreuz, MP (Canada), and Ugo Gussalli Beretta (Italy).   Source: http://www.wfsa.net/amb_06.html  Sounds rather like an expert to me. So, let's see: An acknowledged firearms expert, offering testimony before a UK legislative committee, with said testimony published as an official record.  I'm not sure what you're driving at here."
gunpolitics,3cfly6,billyhorton,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:19:34 2015 UTC,"While the data is somewhat dated, the Bureau of Justice Statistics has information on this topic.  This page compares the conviction rates for various England and the U.S. between 1981 and 1996.  I'll quote some of the more pertinent info:    Data compiled by courts nationwide (State, Federal and juvenile courts in the United States; juvenile and adult courts in England) formed the basis for the conviction rate, defined for all offenses except rape as the number of persons convicted during the year per 1,000 population age 10 or older. (Age 10 is the minimum conviction age in England. No U.S. minimum exists, but rarely do juvenile court referrals involve children under age 10 (25,000 out of 1.5 million cases in 1994 according to Loeber and Farrington, 1998, page 24.))   So, even if the U.K. does adjust their numbers, we can still compare the U.S. to the U.K. by doing the same adjustment, i.e., comparing conviction rates.   The U.S. conviction rate per 1,000 population is higher than England's for murder, rape, and robbery. Is that because the United States has higher rates of victimization from murder, rape, and robbery? Or because the criminal justice system in the United States is more likely than the English system to catch and convict murderers, rapists, and robbers?   And the answer is:   The higher U.S. conviction rate for murder is explained entirely by the higher U.S. murder rate. According to the most recent statistics on crime (1996) and the justice system (1994 in the United States, 1995 in England), the U.S. murder rate is nearly six times the English murder rate (figure 5). Correspondingly, the U.S. murder conviction rate per 1,000 population is nearly six times England's (.059 versus .010) (figure 19).   So, the U.S. has a higher rate for murder, so the U.S. conviction rate for murder is also higher than the U.K.'s by the same margin.  The BJS website has a lot of good information, including more up-to-date figures.  But since the article compares the U.S. to the U.K., this seemed to be the most relevant."

That's just as stupid as voting based solely on abortion rights, etc. The president can't do a whole lot in terms of writing new gun control laws, so the important elections regarding issues like that are your local senators and congressmen. I wouldn't want a jackass president in charge only because he's a gun guy. I know it's blasphemy to say here, but there really are more important things for us to worry about."

gunpolitics,3cd0lr,hoodpaladin,8,Tue Jul 7 13:12:39 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but Bernie is far from an a massively anti-gun candidate.  It is an issue far from his platform and set of agendas.  He also hasn't taken money from the anti-gun astroturf groups and billionaires, unlike most other candidates.   The funny part is that Obama WAS supposed to be tough on guns and DID try and make it a central issue.  He also TRIED very hard to get more restrictions and in 8 years, the only thing they managed to accomplish (and this was mostly due to foreign policy) on the gun front was the ban some Russian ammo and a few direct Russian import rifles, which has been gotten around now.  So if an immensely anti-gun candidate who took money from the anti-gun lobby and made is a central issue cannot get a single thing done in 8 years about it, what makes you think a candidate for whom guns are a tertiary issue at best will do any better or push any harder?"

gunpolitics,3cbm2r,Freeman001,-16,Tue Jul 7 00:03:18 2015 UTC,"you're right.  The Court is more beholden to precedent, as when Scalia wrote:     We therefore read Miller to say only that the Second Amendment does not protect those weapons not typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes     this would certainly include machine guns."
gunpolitics,3cbm2r,macksionizer,10,Tue Jul 7 02:30:04 2015 UTC,"Miller's precedent was 'common use' by the militia, which machine guns would be, but that isn't even the argument being pushed. Scalia said himself that you can ban whole classes of firearms, which machine guns are and what FOPA does. Dangerous and unusual also doesn't pertain to the type of weapon, but the manner in which it is carried, or an affray, which has been common law precedent for hundreds of years.   Edit: in a very recent ruling, the Supreme Court said that The supreme a felon possessing a short barreled shotgun is not inherently violent. They argued that it's specific use in a crime, not its mere existence is what made it a violent weapon. You could apply the same logic to machine guns as well. Merely possessing one doesn't make it unusually dangerous."
gunpolitics,3cbm2r,Freeman001,-14,Tue Jul 7 03:23:51 2015 UTC,Dangerous and unusual also doesn't pertain to the type of weapon     i'll take this as prima facie evidence that you're smoking hashish.

gunpolitics,3cbm2r,macksionizer,7,Tue Jul 7 04:37:10 2015 UTC,"The big determining factor is what 'dangerous and unusual' means. The citation i gave you shows how the courts defined the phrase. The most recent ruling shows that short barreled weapons, which are regulated by the NFA do not, in and of themselves, represent an inherent danger unless used in the commission of a violent crime. Since we know that NFA items do not qualify as dangerous or unusual under that the common law definition and the court has ruled that NFA items are not dangerous, there is standing that machine guns do not warrant being banned because they are not dangerous and unusual."

gunpolitics,3cbm2r,millstone102,-19,Tue Jul 7 00:37:14 2015 UTC,"the ""well-regulated militia"" is a subset of ""the militia"".  if that's true that ""the militia"" meant any member of the general public who was armed, the ""well-regulated militia"" meant something else.  it meant some smaller body of the general public that was officially organized and trained together.  if the authors of the 2A had meant for the amendment to confer a right to the general public, then they would have begun merely by saying ""A militia"".  but they didn't, they said ""A well-regulated militia"".    in Federalist Paper 29, Alexander Hamilton forcefully argues that there was no possible way to properly train a disciplined force made up of the entire public.  he is quite clear that a force made up of everybody could never be considered ""well-regulated"".    so there you have it, right from the mouth of a Founding Father:  well-regulated does not mean, and could not mean, everybody.  ergo, the 2A  was not conferring an individual right."
gunpolitics,3cbm2r,macksionizer,9,Tue Jul 7 02:57:42 2015 UTC,"Well the clause is providing a rationale not a prerequisite sooo.....   The collectivist argument doesn't and hasn't stood up to scrutiny.  I can also pick words out of s sentence and imply it means something it doesn't. It doesn't change the facts that:   Nothing about the prefaratory clause implies a prerequisite, but only a rationale.  ""Well-regulated"" in parlance of the time translates to ""well equipped and prepared"" In no other part of the constitution does ""the people"" refer to anything but rights of individual citizens,    and   Even if all the points above somehow fail, the ""militia"" is defined as all able-bodied male citizens, so no, that does not mean the National Guard.    Did you know Virginia has an organized state militia, state sanctioned and commanded by the Governor, that is not related or part of the Natiobal Guard? (They have that too.)  Anyone can join. Can they have guns in your world?"

gunpolitics,3cbm2r,tcp1,13,Tue Jul 7 00:43:06 2015 UTC,"yep. and we are. except that ""we"" now means the state national guard.   Not according to the supreme court or the federalist papers.

gunpolitics,3cbm2r,ercax,7,Tue Jul 7 00:41:19 2015 UTC,well-regulated.    Who has the right to keep and bear arms?  A militia or the People?
gunpolitics,3cbm2r,fuckoffplsthankyou,-9,Tue Jul 7 07:32:17 2015 UTC,"it's first important to keep the terms straight.  there seem to be three important ones here:     ""militia"":  as can be easily cited and supported, ""militia"" meant pretty much everybody.  any able-bodied man with a gun could be part of the militia.      ""well-regulated militia"":  it appears that the ""well-regulated"" qualifier has been the bone of contention all along, from the George Mason-Alexander Hamilton spats right up to the present day.  Mason feared standing armies in peacetime, and Hamilton feared that their victories against the British would end up being only temporary without one.  Hamilton eventually won this argument, and was of course completely vindicated.  And in the year 2015, very few Americans wish to dissolve the US military.    while Mason appears to want to believe that a militia force, made up of anybody who wants to show up that day, can be considered well-regulated, Hamilton issues a forceful repudiation of this dubious proposition in Federalist Paper #29.  regardless of its impact on Mason's opinions, it is difficult to read FP29 and come away with any sense that Mason's hopeful belief that the terms can be equivalent is any more than that.  the main takeaway from this is that it's a hopelessly romantic notion that Americans could stream down from the hills with their hunting muskets, or steam up from their suburban basements with their Glock 9-mils, and form any sort of fighting force that could in any way be considered ""well-regulated"".  this was obvious to Hamilton in 1788, and it's just as obvious now.  though much has changed since then, this hasn't.    ""The People"":  does it mean everybody?  all non-slaves?  all voters?  all land owners?  my best guess here is that it means the duly elected representatives of the voters and their agents and staffs.  i say this because of the legal term ""The People vs. Such-and-Such"".  when a court case is ""The People versus..."", this means basically the prosecutor, who represents the public.  the public may be welcome to come and observe the proceedings in the courtroom, but they don't prepare the case or argue it.  and if they object to any of that, then they must use the avenue of the ballot box to make their dissatisfaction known.    therefore i argue that when the Founders said things like, ""...the right of the people shall not be infringed"", what they meant was that state and local govt units' rights to represent the will of their constituents should not be infringed by federal action.    therefore, in the 2A, ""The People"" basically means the state governments.  and it's saying that the federal govt may not deprive the states of having their own well-regulated militias.  this after all was the central motivation behind all of this, the fear of standing armies and the tendency of Monarchs at that time to use them to deprive any smaller local fighting forces of their weapons in order to eliminate threats from usurpers to the throne."
gunpolitics,3cbm2r,macksionizer,2,Tue Jul 7 13:38:25 2015 UTC,"""The People"": does it mean everybody?   Obviously in your mind, the People refers to duly elected representatives of the voters.  So tell me, what are the voters referred to as?  The Plebs?   therefore i argue that when the Founders said things like, ""...the right of the people shall not be infringed"", what they meant was that state and local govt units' rights to represent the will of their constituents should not be infringed by federal action.    So, the ""right of the people"" in your mind equals ""the right of the govt"".     therefore, in the 2A, ""The People"" basically means the state governments.   Does ""The People"" mean the state govt when referring to the 1st or the 4th?  Yea, you are an idiot."
gunpolitics,3cbm2r,fuckoffplsthankyou,-5,Tue Jul 7 18:11:36 2015 UTC,"well what does ""the people versus so-and-so"" mean in court?  do you have any thoughts on that?"
gunpolitics,3cbm2r,macksionizer,4,Tue Jul 7 21:06:17 2015 UTC,"well what does ""the people versus so-and-so"" mean in court?    people  n. the designation for the prosecuting government in a criminal trial, as in People v. Capone. Such a case may also be captioned State v. Davis or in federal prosecutions, United States v. Miller.   do you have any thoughts on that?   Of course but I want to explore your assertion that only duly elected officials are afforded constitutional rights.  You said:   therefore, in the 2A, ""The People"" basically means the state governments.    Is it your position that this is the case for the other Constitutional protections?  If not, why not?  What makes the 2nd different from the first in this regard?  Are you saying that the only way I can exercise freedom of speech is to be elected to office?

Go educate yourself, it will do you good.   that wouldn't have been remotely possible.   Just as it would be impossible today.  Doesn't stop stupid from trying.   rather, they were afraid that somebody would seize power and try to keep them from having organized state militias.

gunpolitics,3chbli,macksionizer,9,Tue Jul 7 22:24:52 2015 UTC,"Interesting, but ultimately not terribly helpful.  On face value it would suggest that if US removes guns we'll have a UK-like murder rate, but that's overly simplistic and doesn't prove much about guns.  It shows that UK has a less violent society than US, but you can't just blame that on guns.    Our murder rate is largely effected by our high drug use, militant police/anti-drug policies, and the prevalence of violent gangs supplying those drugs.  UK has NHS, which makes getting health care easy-  US has no such thing, which means poor drug users go to jail rather than rehab (where they only learn to become more violent).    I also don't think firearm homicides is as useful a number- I care more about TOTAL homicides and TOTAL violent crime.  If I get killed by a violent criminal, I'm just as dead if he stabs me or hits me with a baseball bat instead of shoots me.    So if you want to show a real effect, I'd want to see a plot over time of overall murder rate (before/after the gun ban), and overall violent crime rate (before/after the gun ban).    For example- this graph shows the gun ban having little effect on overall violent crime.    On homicides- the UK gun ban had little if any useful effect.  It's worth noting that the later drop in homicides is because they hired a LOT more cops rather than because of lack of guns..."

It doesn't work for marijuana.  As last weekend's shootings in Chicago grimly illustrate, it doesn't work for guns.  If we want to reduce violence, we have to look at the root causes.  This takes us into discussions of educational disparities, lack of economic opportunities, and our 19th-century approach to dealing with mental illness.

gunpolitics,3c8bvx,Serenity-,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:32:37 2015 UTC,"So, after 40 studies covering nearly 100 years they couldn't find a single shred of evidence in support of those measures reducing violence.  Why do you support them?"
gunpolitics,3c8bvx,learath,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:34:24 2015 UTC,The Task Force found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combinations of laws reviewed on violent outcomes. (Note that insufficient evidence to determine effectiveness should not be interpreted as evidence of ineffectiveness.)
gunpolitics,3c8bvx,Serenity-,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:44:06 2015 UTC,"Sure.  There could be evidence so subtle that you can't find it in 100 years.  So you think this evidence, despite being totally invisible, is sufficient to support eliminating a right?  What if this was about books?"
gunpolitics,3c8bvx,learath,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:46:08 2015 UTC,"A better question would be why do you find a conclusion explicitly stated by the authors as incorrect? I see that we need to conduct more studies to better determine and direct policy. That makes sense. Surely you are also aware that the CDC is explicitly defunded from research that concludes gun control measures save lives.   We could start throwing Kleck etc. around, but I didn't engage in this discussion to rehash what gets argued ad nauseum.   Edit to add I said nothing about ""taking away a right""."
gunpolitics,3c8bvx,Serenity-,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:28:44 2015 UTC,I'd like you to answer this honestly: 100 years and 40 studies was not enough evidence for you.  What is?

gunpolitics,3c8bvx,fuzzyyoji,3,Fri Jul 10 18:43:01 2015 UTC,That is a highly one-sided subreddit.  Interesting how few posts have any comments.  It would be quite tiresome to rebut their various misinterpretation of the stats involved.  It's always amazing how people are so willing to believe anything that supports what they want to believe.  Confirmation bias is a powerful thing.

gunpolitics,3c8bvx,learath,2,Mon Jul 6 13:45:46 2015 UTC,"I'll start off by saying your title is all wrong.  It assumes that anti-gun = gun control.  They are not the same thing (but can be).  Keeping felons from legally owning a gun is a type of gun control.  Your title assumes an all or nothing approach on guns.   So my first question to you, is what do you mean by your question?    I don't think felons and the mentally ill should be legally allowed to have guns.  Does that make me anti-gun, just gun control, or a normal gun owner (I think this is the NRA position).  For the most part pro gunners, anti-gunners, and gun control folks talk past each other with no one really willing to or wanting to discuss sound policy.  Can any law keep criminals from obtaining a firearm.  No.  But background checks do make it much more difficult and more expensive for criminals to obtain guns.  Why do so few people actually believe both these facts?"
gunpolitics,3c8bvx,bigstink1,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:07:04 2015 UTC,"Well, lets start this out by asking: Do you think guns are currently subject to extensive regulation, far in excess of any other right?  Also, are you aware that gun control in the US has been pretty much debunked as a method of reducing violence: http://www.cdc.gov/mmwR/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5214a2.htm"
gunpolitics,3c8bvx,txelen,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:02:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, there is regulation and it's extensive in many states, but not all.  Would say pretty extensive on the federal level.  Not sure if its far in excess to other rights.  Many of our rights are heavily regulated.  I can not speak to the study.  I'll note that many of its conclusions are inconclusive or rely on other studies to support its conclusions.  Historical any study on guns, whether pro or anti is flawed and should be suspect.    I see both sides of the issue.  I wish the pro gun people would allow gun laws to be passed that would be beneficial and the anti gun people to allow laws to be revoked that don't help the situation or passed that would not harm it.  But the current political climate will never allow this to happen."

Who also is a paid employee of PPD. The public credentials seem to make them qualified to publish a paper based on analysis of data. Who they are associated with, if that matters, is for individual interpretation.  Their employer does have many areas of business, one is supporting government and public health projects. http://www.ppdi.com/Services/Industry-Expertise/Government-and-Public-Health/Government-Industry-Contracts   PPD also has been recognized as a preferred provider to a consortium of 14 global health Product Development Partners (PDPs), funded in part by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.   Qualifying the 4000 online survey participants in 2013, into a representative result set, was based on the 2010 Census.   Participants are not paid to join the YouGov panel, but do receive incentives through a loyalty program to take individual surveys.   Fatality numbers used in the study are based on the CDC's restricted webbased (WISQARS) data from 2011. http://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/facts.html Which is populated by the National Center for Health Statistics using data from the death registry http://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/pdf/wisqars-factsheet20120425-a.pdf  .......

They had all the data points to make that claim but instead resorted to external data or straight up myths, to support a recommendations to pursue the same flawed approach, to get to an already failed solution."

Previously, Oregon didn't require a background check for transfers/sales outside of a gun show or gun shop. Now, nearly all, even some temporary, transfers require a background check through a dealer. All this statement really means is that the Yamhill County Sheriff and Prosecutor won't actively seek out and prosecute people who make what were, before SB941 was passed, legal transfers. Important to note is also doesn't mean anything about the cities within Yamhill County, where the local police may still enforce the law.

Simply making it a crime to ignore the law will eliminate most of this activity.  besides, it's ATF's job to actively look for gun trafficking, and they have way more resources and organizational expertise at doing this than rural sheriffs do.  and since flipping guns to the secondary market for pocket money appears to be something that lots of local police officers do, investigating this at a level higher than local PD is probably the best way to do that anyway.    941 says that if you violate the law, it's a misdemeanor offense.  unless you violate the law and sell to somebody who it turns out was not allowed to buy guns, in which case it's a Class B felony.  that sounds about right to me.  and apparently to most Oregonians as well."

If it's really just about keeping guns out of excluded individual's hands, why not just make transferring or selling to an excluded individual illegal (oh, right, it already was) and allow law-abiding people to buy and sell without the hassle of going through a dealer if they'd rather not? People who were going to knowingly transfer to an excluded person are still going to no matter if it's against a law or not. SB941 only makes thing difficult for law-abiding citizens."
gunpolitics,3c1jkc,mclumber1,-4,Sun Jul 5 05:49:45 2015 UTC,"you have just expressed the two classic twin pillars of willful ignorance about background check requirements for gun purchases:  1) ""There are already laws to keep people from selling to prohibited buyers.""    Incorrect.  The laws of most states offer no legal disincentive not to sell to prohibited buyers.  In order for a seller to get into any trouble for such a sale, it would have to be provable later that he knew or had reason to know that buyer was prohibited.  If you think about this for five seconds you'll know that this is going to be an extremely rare occurrence.  the result is that, no:  the laws of most states do not provide any effective deterrence to selling to prohibited buyers.    2)  ""Even if you pass the law, people will just ignore it.""    no they won't.  most people won't commit crimes knowingly, especially just to save a few bucks.  there is nothing about a universal background check requirement that presents any serious obstacle to owning a gun.  a cost increase of perhaps 2%-5% and a drive to the gun shop during business hours.  since you'd have to drive to meet your Armslist buyer in some parking lot anyway, driving to the gun store is hardly a barrier to the transaction.  especially considering that there are currently more FFL gun dealers in the US than there are McDonalds restaurants."

gunpolitics,3c1jkc,macksionizer,5,Sun Jul 5 14:15:00 2015 UTC,"That's very different from seeking out violators of this law.

gunpolitics,3c1jkc,macksionizer,5,Sun Jul 5 21:12:10 2015 UTC,So why criminalize thousands of innocent transactions when you are only interested in a relative few? Here (North Carolina) we are required to verify that a purchaser has a CCW or a purchase permit. I'm not a big fan of that system either but at least it doesn't direct all sales through dealers. Why not allow buyers to obtain a NICS certification on themselves? This would allow a private seller to perform his/her due diligence without transfer fees or records of every transaction.
gunpolitics,3c1jkc,kenabi,-2,Sun Jul 5 21:35:29 2015 UTC,"while WI's system, like massachusettes' system, is better than nothing, it is an inferior solution because both parties to transfers involving a prohibited buyer have an incentive to either directly subvert the system (the buyer), or to play dumb while the other party subverts it, and then later claim they didn't realize. (the seller, who just wants the cash, and would rather not jeopardize his sale).    involving the third party of the FFL shop is much better because the FFL shop has a very strong incentive not to turn a blind eye to sketchy transactions that don't look kosher.  this is why state UBC laws, such as OR's and CO's, follow this model.  as for complaints about the added cost, a few minutes on an online FFL dealer finder search tool will tell show you that their advertised fees for NICS checks are typically in the $10-$20 dollar range.  this is going to be somewhere around 2-5% of the sale price of the average gun on the secondary market.  it's not nothing, but it is hardly a barrier to gun ownership.  that is, unless you are an unlicensed high volume gun flipper...  as for the desire to deprive LEO of records of gun sales and ownership:  sorry, but those days are numbered.  the rest of society doesn't think that there is any good argument to be made for maintaining the ability to secretly stockpile private arsenals of unlimited size, when that's the very same behavior that really bad gun traffickers also display.  after federal UBC passes, you'll still be able to buy all the guns you want to own.  you just won't be able to quietly flip them onto the secondary market without a legal care in the world anymore.  and the only way to accomplish this is by forcing every legal gun owner in America to register every purchase with a central database.  that's just the way it'll be, and people will grumble at first, but then when the govt miraculously doesn't begin rounding us all up for the prison camps, even most of the nutters will move on to something else to conspiro about.  the Hollow Earth Theory, maybe.  or Molemen!

gunpolitics,3c1jkc,macksionizer,6,Sun Jul 5 07:02:41 2015 UTC,"You know, watching the video of the proceedings, and talking to quite a few people about this topic before the actual hearings in Salem, well. most people didn't understand it, and everyone else was either against it or indifferent. The only support I could find was from people who would otherwise benefit from it, those who were paid to support it, or those who can't seem to understand why it's a bad thing.  Having worn a badge of some sort or another for several years now, I can tell you flat out from multiple facets of approach, background checks don't do anything but say 'this person has no record that we know of.'  A background check isn't any kind of guarantee of anything, since it's easy to lie your ass off and grab someone else' info if you're gonna bother to go the full distance. I've seen people who have passed some of the most extensive background checks you can imagine turn around and rob people blind, stab people in the back literally, commit assault, and yes even shoot people.   I've known people who I found out later on were in the black market as fencers. All these laws do is make them laugh. 0% effectiveness against them.  Against the kind of incident you see in the news? Most of those asshats have passed background checks with flying colors. The Rest? stole or murdered and then stole the guns they used.  So what, we needlessly inconvenience people who have no inclination to go killing other people to feed into a twisted psychotic mindset that's telling them to go on a murderous rampage? Add excess to an already overburdened State agency to the amount of checks need to actually have a 100% compliance rate?  Even Bloomberg and his staff who paid for the majority of the pushing behind this law admit that they don't do anything to combat actual crime, or pretty much all of the current Federal officials have admitted it on live national tv. And yet they still push the numbers they cook from cherry picked stats to try and make all these laws seem like Good Things(TM).   People who want to stick their head in the proverbial sand from either side can keep their delusions, me? I'll stick to the cold hard truth that the only way to deal with crime and the incidents we keep seeing in the news is to address the socio-economical issues that plague this country, starting with how throwing money at things makes all the bad go away for the rich, but those who don't have much can't even seem to get anywhere in life these days.  Band-aids don't fix society. Pointing fingers doesn't fix society.  This nation doesn't have a gun problem, it has a broken system with people in power gaming the system towards making them look good or benefit them in some way, taking advantage of things that happen that sometimes suck horribly, diguised as a gun problem.  Our educational systems are broken, and getting worse. Our media outlets focus one direction per channel, with heavy bias towards a leaning one way or the other.  Nothing is being done but slapping on a shiny new face of illusory safety and happiness that is about as real as a unicorn being ridden by Optimus Prime.  You want to really stop 'Gun Violence'? address the socio-economical concerns that lead to these acts.   Our country doesn't have the largest population, and yet we do have the largest population of anti-depressant prescriptions being handed out on average, roughly 13-18% of the population in this country is on some flavor of such, there were enough prescriptions for various ADs in 2010 to give one to every man woman and child in the country, going by the CDCs yearly reports, and that number went up roughly 400% by 2013.  and hey, most of these people were on some flavor of AD, either a little prior to, or during the time of said event.   Having been involved with people who have been on various flavors of these meds, the things they do the minds of some people is horrific. a single dose can have them beating their heads on walls hard enough it splits their skin open, blood pouring down their faces, you can hear their skulls creak from the force of impact and all they'll repeat is 'Why can't I stop thinking these thoughts, why am I this way?' with later asking of them getting little beyond a very dark impression of suicidal or homicidal thought patterns.  And this is before you get into the Gangs which aren't even being remotely discussed and account for 80-90% of all 'gun violence' in the country. the DOJ, CDC, and FBI numbers all agree, young urban minority males, 17-28 make up almost all of that 80-90%. and all but the smallest fraction of that number are traced back to gang activity.  No one is trying to go out and crack down heavily on the gangs.  Even here in Portland, lip service at best.  LA? NYC? Chicago? the gang members laugh at weapons laws and then do whatever they want, they don't need to really fear the cops because the cops won't do much beyond the token arresting if its not going to get them killed, or if they aren't being paid off.  Police corruption / distancing / Superiority complexes / lack of training is another aspect I won't get too far into.  There's so many issues at play here, and everyone wants to blame an inanimate object that has to have someone holding it.   Much like the images floating around says, When there's a bombing, we blame the bomber. When there's a drunk driving accident, we blame the driver.  This nation needs personal accountability, not finger pointing. And yet, this is a smoke and mirrors attempt to look like they're doing something while they turn around and do whatever they want.  There's such a huge scope of angles here, and the focus is 'guns are bad, mm'kay?' no, uneducated, poverty stricken cities (lookin' at you Detroit) are bad. Police forces that are totally hands off about gangs (which is near nation wide policy) are a bad thing. No support for mental health without the stigma factor is a bad thing.  None of these things are truly being addressed in a meaningful manner, and until they are, this sort of thing is going to continue. and passing laws like 941 are just going to make it easier for people like Bloomberg and co so say 'they broke the law, they're criminals'. But hey, only because you bought out the politicians to vote for it, Mikey.   And to note: the people who voted yes for it? Their support donations are public record, and yes, almost all of them have a Bloomberg funded group in the listing.  And then, well. then we have bullshit like this 'it's a good thing!'  HOW?  You can't legislate Crazy. Period.  Career Criminals don't give two shits for laws.  Gang members don't give any shits for laws.  Criminals aren't required to incriminate themselves, by laws no less!  what are you left with? people who wouldn't do these heinous acts to start with, and thus aren't part of the equation unless it's as a victim.  If a law isn't going to actual do what it is proposed to do (stop crime/mass shootings, in this instance.) Then said law shouldn't become a law. Ever.  Look at NY and Cali, they have UBCs, sure in the fuck hasn't stopped general crime with firearms, and shootings there. Or how about Chicago? No? Same story with that city. Tight gun laws, horrible crime rates.  How about Illinois? they got some pretty strict laws, and yet... oh wait, East St Louis is Murder Capital of the country. #2? Camden NJ. Another tight gun law state.  But lets dig a bit here. the DOJ/FBI/CDC numbers point back to The same overal figures, 80-90% of firearm deaths in these places are 17-28, and urban male youths with ties to gang activity. Shocking!  Anyone who truly wants to get rid of 'Gun Violence' will have to fix society as a whole. Slapping a baby sized band-aid on a severed limb just makes you look like an idiot."
gunpolitics,3c1jkc,macksionizer,-2,Sun Jul 5 08:11:26 2015 UTC,"*** BEGINNING OF PART 1 OF 2-PART COMMENT (CONTINUED IN NEXT COMMENT) ***    A background check isn't any kind of guarantee of anything     of course not---but why would it need to be?  since when was a ""guarantee of prevention"" a requirement of, or even an expectation of, a law prohibiting a particular activity?  your use of this language tells me that you are very likely not an LEO as you imply.  even a cadet at  police academy would grasp the two basic facts that number one, NO law can ""guarantee prevention"" of an activity, and two, the fact of number one doesn't mean that we should scrap our laws against murder, rape, theft, or whatever.  selling guns to strangers in parking lots who may or may not be dangerous people who aren't allowed to own them is an activity that a landslide majority of Americans think should be prohibited by a law that provides an effective punishment for doing it.     if UBC keeps guns away from a good chunk of dangerous people seeking a gun, then it's worth it.  and regardless of whether you personally think that UBC will fail at this goal, the opinion of 80%+ of Americans, and nearly half of gun owners themselves btw, is that it will be effective enough at this goal to justify the small inconvenience and nominal cost to legal gun owners.       since it's easy to lie your ass off and grab someone else' info if you're gonna bother to go the full distance     this is certainly possible, and some motivated prohibited individuals will no doubt try it.  some will succeed, and some will fail.  but every attempt that fails will serve as a strong warning to others who might consider attempting it that this decision might land them in jail as well.  this is a strong deterrent to many.  the law doesn't need to 100% guarantee that the activity is completely eliminated---no law can, or ever has, done that.  not even laws against murder.  which is why preventing/catching a good chunk of it is an acceptable outcome to most Americans.  that's why a national UBC law has overwhelming public support.     I've seen people who have passed some of the most extensive background checks you can imagine turn around and...stab people in the back literally     ""the most extensive background check i could imagine""?  you mean like, the Director of the CIA?  that's the most extensive background check i could imagine.  you actually know someone who has an appointment-level national security clearance who literally stabbed someone in the back once?  pardon me if i find this hard to believe.      I've known people who I found out later on were in the black market as fencers     yeah, probably most of us do.  in most states, a seller can post a gun for sale on Armslist, take a phone call, drive 10 minutes to some parking lot somewhere, exchange his gun for cash with a total stranger, do absolutely nothing to determine whether or not the buyer is legally allowed to own a gun, has six assault charges and nine drunk and disorderlies, is a hunted fugitive, an escapee from prison, etc...then drive off with his money and zero worries that he's just committed a crime.    however, if his buyer was indeed prohibited, then that sale was part of the black market.  for other redditors following along with this exchange, i suggest they slowly and carefully read and digest the following bolded statement, because it is critical to seeing through the disingenuous use of language by people trying to keep us from passing national UBC:  If an otherwise law-abiding private off the books gun seller's buyer turns out to be prohibited, then buyer committed a crime and the sale itself was illegal, and thus it was part of ""the black market"" for guns---even though the seller committed no punishable offense.  in other words, a ""black market sale"" does not require both participants to be demonstrably aware that the sale itself is illegal.  you know in the cartoons where they always show the stranger in the trench coat on the street corner who goes, PSSST!  hey buddy!....wanna buy a watch?  and he opens one side of his trench coat to reveal dozens of watches hanging from the coat in a virtual display case for the passerby to select from.  the reason this old gag gets a chuckle is that it's obvious to the audience that the watches have to be stolen even though there's nothing expressly illegal about selling someone else a piece of jewelry that you own.    in the case of private anonymous gun sales, it's the reverse setup:  it's the buyer who may or may not be committing the crime, and the seller who may or may not suspect that the sale itself is illegal.  but even if he does suspect his buyer is prohibited for some reason, for authorities to prove that he suspected this later would be next to impossible.  it would essentially require the transaction to be a sting operation where the buyer is an undercover LEO who mentions casually that he's prohibited and seller sells anyway.  but your basic high-volume Armslist gun flipper will be wary of this possibility and will end the transaction if buyer admits he's prohibited.  some doofus who's selling that one handgun he bought years ago and never used, and now he's short on rent and needs the money, doofus might go ahead with the transaction, but ATF isn't really concerned with catching the one-off gun seller doofus.  they're concerned with the high volume gun flippers who take advantage of the NICS 24-hour deletion rule to buy one gun per day retail and flip it onto the secondary market for a nice little lucrative side business as an unlicensed gun dealer.  and while even pro gunner advocates agree that these guys are violating the spirit of the federal statute and should be prosecuted, pro gunners fein ignorance to the sad fact that the federal statute contains poorly worded exceptions which make it nearly impossible for a court to prosecute them.  so ATF is essentially powerless to do anything but secretly monitor their activities and hope that at least they can catch the worst of their prohibited customers.    btw, if you sit down and talk to a seasoned ATF agent about all this, when you get around to the punchline and ask him what he thinks about the effectiveness of the laws as they are currently written, he will politely decline and say that answering such a question would be seen as a political expression and he cannot answer it.    now consider how deeply messed up this is:  ATF itself is being pressured from the highest levels of the political sphere not to even publicly express an opinion on the effectiveness of the current laws concerning gun sales in the US.  but ATF is basically the only agency conducting organized surveillance of an activity that clearly violates the spirit of a federal statute.  activity that even Pro Gun says it doesn't condone.    so, the only agency that goes out and actively looks for illegal trafficking of a product used to commit 2/3 of all homicides in the US, an economic activity that no one openly condones, and that even the NRA says they want stopped, that agency has been effectively muzzled by the gun lobby, through pressure on a handful of key committee members in Congress, to make sure that that agency is afraid to express an opinion on whether or not our current laws are properly written to achieve their obvious law enforcement goals.    this is why even many gun owners themselves hate the NRA, and their shills, and everything they stand for.  it's so blatantly obvious what's going on here:  a manufacturing lobby is working to make sure that no laws ever get written that will have the result of negatively impacting sales of their product.  and the industry has spent the last four decades funding and helping out this mighty surrogate partner in their sales goals.  NRA hides behind the 2A and this bullshit about the specter of tyranny and plays to the Red Dawn fantasy in the mind of every guy whose brain ever released a bracing rush of adrenaline into his bloodstream while watching an action movie where the hero locks and loads and blows away The Bad Guys™ to protect the hot chick who naturally ends up falling for him because he's so big and strong and she feels so safe and protected by him that she wants to sleep next to him.

Add excess to an already overburdened State agency to the amount of checks need to actually have a 100% compliance rate?      um, yeah, i don't even know how to respond to all this gibberish.  other than to point out to others following along what to look for in long pro gunner comments that amount to a sure sign of ideologically driven anti-gun regulation bias.  this comment block of yours is a clunky chimera of like half a dozen distinct gun lobby canards all just Frankensteined together in a torrent of irrational pro-gunnity.    one thing's for sure, now i know you're not LEO.  big long blatherings like this never come from rank and file police officers, whose very job is to protect the basic foundations of civil society.  they only emanate from weirdos like you who don't actually care about civil society.  if it was up to you, we'd all be living in razor wire compounds spending our afternoons atop guard towers indiscriminately machine-gunning the post-apocalyptic hordes of marauding whatevers who periodically try to storm the gates in search of our food and attractive female co-stars.        Add excess to an already overburdened State agency to the amount of checks need to actually have a 100% compliance rate?     again with the ""If it can't guarantee 100% prevention of the bad activity, then the law is useless"" bullshit.  so i guess you support repealing laws against murder and rape and theft, right?  no?  well that's a bit of a chin-scratcher then isn't it, since human societies have always had laws against these things even though we also clearly understand that none of these laws can possibly 100% prevent them from ever happening.  yet with all this clearly in mind, you still manage to insist that the rest of us assume some categorical distinction that requires laws against gun sales to dangerous people to be this one oddball exception to the entire universe of law-making.  well, i don't, and the vast majority of Americans don't either.  the only people who do are gun nut fundies like you.  i don't realistically expect you do drop your bullshit arguments just because they're such clear bullshit, any more than i'd expect someone accused of a serious crime to admit he did it.  we know the motivations, and we can pretty accurately predict the behavior that will result.    so keep in mind that i don't bother to type all of this out with any shred of a belief that you'll respond rationally or honestly to it.  i know you won't.  but then, i don't write these responses for you, i write them for the many others who are silently reading along.  i often think of myself and the gun nuts i indulge with my spilled ink as opposing counsels in court, with a silent judge and jury listening intently to the various arguments being made and dissected.  it's a general truism that the more people you perceive are listening to you speak, and the more diverse the crowd, the more apt you are to avoid sloppy arguments and stating obvious lies for which you can be called out.  it's also been my experience here on these gun subs that pro gun safety commentors are happy to speak to into the ""microphones"", whereas pro gunners are not.  pro gunners really want it to be just the two of us in a sound-proof room with nobody else around.  except maybe their thuggish surrogates giving me menacing glares in the background.    the old saying is that ""The truth will out"".  this is why pro gun will always lose in the court of public opinion, and also why pro gun will always avoid the court of public opinion.  they can't win there, so they keep demanding a change of venue.  but the gears of public policy will eventually turn around, and the public is becoming more and more aware of just how crappy and ridiculous pro gun's lame-ass arguments are.  and how dishonest.  national UBC will pass soon, because it's what the public wants.  and you know what we'll hear from legal gun owners the next day?  nothing.  we'll hear no big complaints because most legal gun owners admit that the minor inconvenience and small cost associated with enacting national UBC is tiny compared the obvious public policy goal it furthers.    once again, keep in mind that i couldn't give less of a flying fig what your response to all this is---i'm not saying it for your benefit anyway.      Even Bloomberg and his staff who paid for the majority of the pushing behind this law admit that they don't do anything to combat actual crime     more silliness.     Blah Blah Blah ""it won't work anyway"", blah blah blah gangs, blah blah Chicago, yada yada ""it's the minorities"", blah ""it's the pill heads"", blah police corruption, blah focus on the root causes of societal ills and [hand-wave] look away from the gun thing in my left hand, blah blah blah...     even more silliness.  maybe i'll print it out and mount it on my dartboard.  or even better, have my buddy who teaches Logic and Language courses assign your comments to his students and have them rip them apart for a graded assignment.  discussing the same old boring logical fallacies in magazine ad copy gets monotonous for him after a while, so he'd probably appreciate the change of (dishonest) scenery.      Having worn a badge of some sort or another for several years      yeah, i ""wore a badge for several years"" myself---in Cub Scouts.    pro gunner LPT:  if you're gonna deceptively misrepresent yourself and your qualifications to create the false aura of authority while you comment on the role of guns in society, at least just blatantly lie and say you're a cop or something.  i'll won't believe it for a minute, but the way you said it sounds like you're the night security guard at a Dunkin' Donuts.  [ha ha, ""America runs on Crazy""??]     but my guess is that you probably do have some douchey low-level security job that allows you to indulge your violent fantasies of getting to heroically blow someone away someday and get away with it.  you're most likely a real-life version of Constable Bob on the TV show ""Justified"", with just enough legitimate access to firearms to be a danger to yourself and others.  guys like you are often attracted to security jobs because you get to play Starsky & Hutch in your mind all night while you sip coffee and jack off to Chuck Norris movies in your little guard shack.  luckily, for every one of you, there are three other legal gun owners in the US who aren't fat-ass maladjusted gun fetishizers.  this majority of American gun owners are just as repulsed as non-gun owners are by guys like you.  and just like long-time conservative writers coming out and saying that things like confederate flags and Sarah Palin are indeed stupid embarrassments and need to go, normal everyday right-thinking gun owners with happy marriages and healthy social lives are recently waking up and finding their voice in this gun ""debate"" against dishonest social misfits and their silent partners in the gun-selling business.    (btw, i'll bet your crappy guard shack gig doesn't pay that much.  i'll bet you'd love to find a nice little lucrative side business that would help you knock out some bills.  something that would be by definition off the books and tax-free.  hmmm, if only there was something to conveniently sell for a profit, Craigslist-style...gee i can't think of anything, can you?  ;|"

I've seen full on crazy rage in my face, close enough I could make out every little flex of their pupils.  I don't glorify my job, and I personally think asshats that act like mall cops, regardless of whatever their job title is, need to be permanently barred from any sort of position with authority. I haven't the slightest clue what the basis of this 'Justified' TV show is about, as to be honest, most TV is trash and I have little use for it. Go read a book or 40, educate yourself some.  And sorry to disappoint, I don't work in a guard shack, I think chuck is actually pretty overrated (though he's done some nifty humanitarian gigs.)

And 'Court of Public Opinion'? Pretty sure it's been tried, and look how successful Shannon Watts, and Mikey are at getting much of any response that doesn't involve tossing money at people. There have been multiple attempts by 'the pro-gun side', even though some of these people are just researchers who have had their data sets misused by the 'anti's' who want a discourse in a nationally recognized public forum (usually a high viewership TV show) and the Bloomberg minions always refuse. And yes, that's an accurate titling, since they are in fact paid by Bloomberg. Literally. The last 6 attempts I've seen have been MAIG or MDA employees going on air to spew cherry picked stats, they get called out by whoever, regardless, and then back out just before the show and refuse to be onscreen with them. This despite claims that they'll happily have a friendly discourse on the subject with anyone who's done actual research. The last one was Ted Alcorn, the Director of research for MAIG. The man refused to be on air with John Lott. and yet, they'll happily reuse and skew his now long outdated and mostly irrelevant papers from pre-background checks, and then try to make this seem like this is a current figure in relation to sales from FFLs.  But hey, I guess we aren't here for actual reality and facts, because you degenerate into accusing me of being part of the black market and lumping me in with what sound suspiciously like Alex Jones.  And you still dismiss the fact that society as whole is broken, that we need to fix the root cause of why.

Look! the other side is just as nasty and dishonest as we are!  haha, so much for their moral highroad!"

gunpolitics,3c1jrs,Twitch016,4,Sat Jul 4 01:54:08 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem Ohio has with gun rights (which we've seen drastically improve over the past decade) is that our politicians won't pull the FOP / other police union's dicks out of their mouths.  Every single bill gets the same response from the police unions of ""ALL POLICE WILL DIE IF THIS IS PASSED!!!"" and it leads to a lot of good bills getting killed or horrifically neutered.  Unless the officer is being asked to provide comment on specific parts of a bill using specific facts, they have no fucking business having any input on a bill.  Maag's attempt at ending ""duty to inform"" is a great example of this.  After Officer Harless went full retard and nearly murdered a CCW holder for legally carrying a gun during a bullshit traffic stop, Maag tried to eliminate the duty to inform in an attempt to prevent future incidents between law abiding citizens and psycho, roid raging cops.  As usual though, the police insisted that all cops would die if non-violent people with no intention of shooting a cop didn't tell cops that they have a gun on them, and all facts and logic were tossed out the window during the typical police fellatio ritual of the Ohio congress."

gunpolitics,3c1jrs,macksionizer,5,Mon Jul 6 00:02:12 2015 UTC,"As an Ohioan, here are my thoughts on Kasich based on his time as governor and from statements he has made.  I honestly don't see him supporting  gun control if he were to become president. However, I really don't see him getting behind loosening gun laws as they currently stand either, apart from maybe giving support to national CCW reciprocity. While he isn't the ideal candidate from a single-issue second amendment, he would be a breath of fresh air in that we wouldn't have to constantly be on the defensive. I think he would also help us out in making pro second amendment judicial appointments.  TL;DR He probably won't be our best friend but he also won't be our enemy."

This was five years after the AWB.  It's quite possible the guy changed his mind on gun control during that time.  People do such things.  That said, Kasich who?  Aren't there already 1,463 candidates for the Republican spot in 2016?  I don't see this guy getting the nomination."

Are you looking for info on this topic for your state?

gunpolitics,3byiy1,bitofgrit,7,Fri Jul 3 06:19:31 2015 UTC,"It seems to me that we've got ""guns on the brain"" when it comes to 2A. The right to keep and bear arms means the effective use of many modalities. However, in only fighting about guns, we don't really notice or care when people get in trouble for having tire-thumpers under car seats, we don't notice the illogic of certain types of knives being illegal in states where you can conceal and open-carry guns.    Beatnicks and greasers carried switchblades in the 50s, people freaked, these knives got treated like ""assault rifles"" and they were largely made illegal. We don't really notice or care and the law stays on the books. A few years back there was this story  I think if you're really for 2A, then your politics have to expand beyond mere gun-politics."
gunpolitics,3byiy1,bitofgrit,7,Fri Jul 3 06:44:57 2015 UTC,"Oh, lol, I see: You're asking rhetorical questions. My bad.  Yeah, I agree with you on the silliness of the majority of ""weapon"" laws. If you can own a battle rifle, then who gives a shit about your knife with a blade longer than x-inches? Even today, people still flip out over switchblades. ""The only reason you'd want one is to stab people faster!""   Morons.  As far as it pertains to the 2A, what I find particularly amusing is that bayonet lugs are a ""feature"" according to the CA AWB. Yet, plenty of those anti-gun types like to make mention that the 2A only took muskets into consideration. You know, those old rifles that usually had bayonets.  I think it is equally foolish that brass knuckles are illegal, because you could... seriously hurt someone in a fist fight? Never mind that you might be the victim of an unwarranted attack, and not the aggressor. Any idea how popular it became to carry a roll of coins?  Regardless of whichever ""weapon"" a person uses to commit a crime, they can/will still receive an ""assault with a deadly weapon"" charge, so it makes little sense to outlaw every damn thing."
gunpolitics,3byiy1,Markuss69,2,Fri Jul 3 07:04:56 2015 UTC,"The clusterfuck that is Connecticut recently changed a law and partially recognized  other weapons as being protected under 2A.  The law is that you can own a switch blade for example but cannot carry it outside your home or private property.  The way it was worded there was technically no legal way to transport such a knife.  Even though it was completely legal to buy one you couldn't even drive it home from the store.  So they changed it because it was a defacto ban on all such ""deadly weapons"", even though everyone had been ignoring it.  So now you can transport them in a locked container or something but still can't carry them, even with a carry permit."

In the US we try to punish criminal action rather than silly things like possible intent.  Try being the key ohrase, obviously, but I am not aware of criminal possession of sporting goods being a thing in even the nanny-est of states  The UK has dived deep into object blaming after the gun ban caused crime to raise rather than fall, so things like ""criminal possession of a tree branch"" or ""holding sporting goods in a scary manner"" are indeed criminalized."
gunpolitics,3byiy1,hobodemon,3,Fri Jul 3 14:21:59 2015 UTC,"Are you sure about that? I don't know myself, but a lot of discussion on the internet suggests that it is.    I stopped a car I saw cruising a lot; obvious they were looking for someone. 4 guys in the car, all 4 had a ball bat. I asked them what they were doing, the usual shakedown stuff. I then asked them what the deal was with the baseball bats. They said they had been playing softball(at midnight?). I then told them they had 15 seconds to produce a ball and a glove. Needless to say, 4 ball bats were confiscated that night.  Under California Law (PC 12020) carrying a ""billy"" is a felony. The courts have defined a baseball bat as a billy but only when it has been modified or shortened in some way. But if you are carrying a regular baseball bat specifically as a weapon, then in theory, that is illegal. Highly unlikely to be arrested or charged unless you are doing something else illegal.  In TX, there was a law against carrying clubs. Gang bangers started to carry baseball bats, small ones in fact. See, it's for sport. However, the police would determine if you were on the way from a game or going to one. If not - busted."

gunpolitics,3btb28,RebelRatel,-6,Sun Jul 12 20:19:11 2015 UTC,"the TAG piece says about the Johns Hopkins study:   ""Also, why did the authors not test their findings by using a different, well-established way of estimating what FHRs would have been absent the law by simply using Connecticut’s own pre-1995 trends to forecast post-1995 rates? Perhaps because this would have indicated that CT was going to experience substantial rate drops after 1995 regardless of whether they revised their gun laws?""      here is a chart showing overall US gun homicide rates form 1981-2010.  notice that the big dramatic feature of the chart is from about 1993-1999, where the rate drops almost in half.  TAG suggests that it would have been better for JH to have used ""pre-1995 trends to forecast post-1995 rates"".  but this would make no sense to do.  here is a screenshot cut-out of the same chart showing only 1981-1994.  would this interval in any way forecast the ""post-1995 rates""?  it's clear that it would not, so if JH had done as TAG suggests, their projection would have been wildly off from what actually happened and would be completely meaningless in any case, no matter what method was used or what conclusions were drawn.  what makes the TAG author's criticism even dumber is that he suggest that if JH had used pre-1995 trends to forecast post-1995 rates"", that somehow this method, along with the meaningless, otherworldly trendline it would produce, would somehow be a more ""well-established way of estimating what FHRs would have been absent the law"".  really?  what ""well-established way"" is that, exactly?  the way in which you take a chart that shows one clearly biggest trend feature, then simply lop off the chart just after that feature starts, then plot a trendline out into nonexistent space based on that?  sorry, but that's not exactly a ""well-established method"" of showing anything.  unless you want to tell an obvious lie with part of a chart.  another reason this is so dumb is that, had JH actually done as the TAG author suggests, then JH could have (wrongly) attributed nearly all of the big drop in gun violence from 1993-present to their 1995 law change.     ruminating on this today, this aspect of the TAG piece really boils down to yet another example of a stupid pro-gun writer, ignorant of statistics and data handling, trying to make a pro-reg study look dishonest, and not only failing miserably because he doesn't grasp the basics of this himself, but also inadvertently revealing his own dishonest nature in the process.  we see this same pattern repeated over and over in pro-gun literature all the time.  it's a big part of the reason why pro-reg commentators on Reddit appear to be spending less and less time affably debunking pro-gunner bullshit for the sake of the pro-gunners.  sometimes, things are simply too dumb to debunk, since the very fact that you're being assaulted with this ignorance in the first place means that the people throwing this shit around aren't educated enough to even see why it's such obvious bullshit.  and you know they're not going to go, ""Oh my!  You're right, Mr TotalOppositeBackgroundAndBeliefSystem!  So sorry, I owe you an apology.  I promise to run out and complete a 200-level statistics course to make amends.""  when somebody comes triumphantly charging into the room with their latest case-breaker, they're almost never happy when you casually show them how they got suckered.  even if it's happening in real-time, in person, this rarely happens.  and when it's anonymous on a forum like Reddit, then fuggedaboutit.    i did read the rest of the article, and the other complaints the author makes are similarly tedious and mostly as dumb as the one i chose to address here.  i chose this particular one to unpack and expose not only because it's so dumb, but also because it so perfectly illustrates how boldly these gunner authors display either their own ignorance, or their sloppy disdain for their readership's powers of comprehension.  perhaps it's both, but really, either one is enough to dismiss this jerk and everything that emanates from his poisoned pen.  unless he decides to start writing about the many-splendored joys of electroshock therapy.  i might be inclined to simply take his word on that one."

I could see supporting them as a gun owner... but unfortunately, we're at the point now where we KNOW this won't be the end... the slippery slope is completely real when you look at what people like him have done in NY for example... so we can't give even an inch, even if they're inches we might be willing to give.  So, we've got to play this game. And we've got to be entrenched and intractable because we're not dealing with people who are, contrary to their words, interested in ""common-sense"" anything. They want guns GONE, period, and that's what they're working towards.   No dice. Not an inch. Period. Good, bad or indifferent on a given proposal, the answer is simply no... most especially when that one simple question can't be answered because it betrays their true intent if they did.

But I'm single with no kids, and my cats paws are too small to pull a trigger. I think it's good that if you have children around  your weapons should be locked or on your person. Exception for your own kids who have maturity and respect for guns - they may need to defend themselves if you are not there or incapacitated.   But they will follow the slippery slope and reach for a ""shall be locked up"" law if given the chance.   On the fire sale, uh, the FFL owns the business and therefore owns the assets of the business. I see what they think is the problem, that the FFL will offload the guns using the ""gun show loophole"" but I think that's paranoia.

Proctor & Gamble isn't liable if they sell a product used to poison someone.  And ammo companies and retailers aren't liable if their bullets are used to shoot someone to death.  The whole reason the suit was thrown out was because of this very ordinary finding of the law.  A whole new law had to be crafted because people wouldn't stop abusing the court system to try to make ammo and firearm manufacturers weirdly liable for crimes committed by others.  No other company gets this treatment but they were targeted, so a law was needed to stop it.  Lucky Gunner didn't enable shit.

That is, a misuse of statistics occurs when a statistical argument asserts a falsehood. In some cases, the misuse may be accidental. In others, it is purposeful and for the gain of the perpetrator. When the statistical reason involved is false or misapplied, this constitutes a statistical fallacy.  The false statistics trap can be quite damaging to the quest for knowledge. For example, in medical science, correcting a falsehood may take decades and cost lives.  Misuses can be easy to fall into. Professional scientists, even mathematicians and professional statisticians, can be fooled by even some simple methods, even if they are careful to check everything. Scientists have been known to fool themselves with statistics due to lack of knowledge of probability theory and lack of standardization of their tests.

You aren't citing a statistic in your quote. You are citing a voting law. Nothing to calculate, derive, or otherwise ""generate"" from Mathematics.  Here is a definition, that you can lookup yourself  The OP about 1 shooting a week is a statistically ""generated"" number, and is a misuse of statistics fallacy.  I find it entertaining that you don't know what a statistic is, and would choose to post what you did as an attempt at a comparison.

gunpolitics,3bjojw,ben70,5,Thu Jul 2 23:37:23 2015 UTC,up here in canada where we have these storage laws they usually find out if you do or dont have them after police enter your house weather with or without your permission and somehow find your guns without a trigger lock  but most times the storage laws are used to charge you with something when you shoot a home intruder since the assumption is the guns mustn't have been locked up if you could get to them in time to defend yourself

gunpolitics,3bjojw,mwmwmwmwmmdw,2,Tue Jun 30 23:33:32 2015 UTC,"This is interesting to me because the two more ""major"" U.S. Supreme Court cases dealing with our right to bear arms (McDonald v. Chicago and D.C. v. Heller) have both emphasized that the right exists largely so that people can protect themselves in their homes.  I realize that Canada's constitution doesn't have a provision like the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, but it's weird that what storage laws in Canada (not sure if they exist in all Provinces) aim to prevent is precisely what the Second Amendment is designed to protect - the right to protect one's self in one's home."

gunpolitics,3bjojw,jeroth,2,Tue Jun 30 12:52:40 2015 UTC,"The last bit where you speak about the gun being used is where you will get in trouble. Basically the law prevents ANY use of the firearm whether it be for self-defense reasons or in the case of what the law speaks of where a child gets ahold of it.  That's the problem with these laws: it makes a common man into a criminal just purely from using the fire arm. It's also the reason why adding more laws can cause a common person to become a criminal merely from just owning a firearm.  It illustrates the danger of why you shouldn't allow gun laws to be passed purely based on emotion. Whenever a law has ""for the children"" slapped on it allows more laws to pass. It's hard to say something against such a law because you'll be painted as the bad guy who wishes to have innocent people die. The idea behind it is to ban guns without having to actually specify that. They merely get you on a technicality by saying, ""Oh wait, you can use a gun for self defense except you can't actually have it loaded at any point. Now you are a felon and you are charged with 2nd degree murder."""
gunpolitics,3bjojw,optionallycrazy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:01:30 2015 UTC,"Whenever a law has ""for the children"" slapped on it allows more laws to pass.   It drives me nuts that so many people want the government to take action to keep kids safe, when the real issue is irresponsible parents.  I do have some sympathy for issues involving kids (though I don't have kids myself) because a child doesn't choose to be born to irresponsible parents.  But at the end of the day, should the government look after society's children, or should that child's parents?  When the government does so, it has to pass laws that affect all people in roughly the same manner, when in reality, those laws are really only going after a very small portion of the population.    I own guns, my friends own guns, and we all know how to be safe with them, and are always safe with them.  We understand and respect what guns are capable of doing if not handled safely, and treat them accordingly.  Maybe I give people too much credit, but I like to think that the vast majority of gun owners are like myself and my friends, such that laws related to storing guns or locking their triggers have no added safety benefits.  And, like you said, when the government tells the people they must do something like lock the triggers on their guns in order to ""keep them safe,"" those people that already know how to be safe are going to disregard the law, so otherwise responsible behavior that differs from the government's idea of what is ""responsible"" or ""safe"" is now just ""illegal.""    I understand that governments protect the social compact, and in that social compact everyone gives up some degree of liberty to reap the benefits (security, order, safety, etc.) of that compact.  But the benefit obtained must be of equal or greater value than the liberty surrendered."

gunpolitics,3bjc2r,popepeterjames,8,Mon Jun 29 18:19:43 2015 UTC,"This is a rather interesting take, actually.  Before, in some states where gay marriage was legal and not in others, one could effectively be married in one and not married in another.  So the federal government stepped in and said that every state must recognize this civil liberty.    I normally don't like to argue for federal government intervention, particularly with gun laws.  However, if all that it would mean is that every state must have reciprocity of handgun carry licenses, where the states can still have their own legal mandates for applying for said license, I think I might be for what this article is attempting to get at."

I'm not sure you realize how big this is being talked about in the south. Gun owners down here believe this ruling applies equally to the gun carry permits and it won't be long before people are carrying in NY and other states with similar bans.

gunpolitics,3bjc2r,trollgenes,4,Mon Jun 29 22:18:58 2015 UTC,"The article's argument appears sound on its face, but probably wouldn't have much weight in court, and is even contradicted in some respects by the Supreme Court's same-sex marriage holding.  I would love for all states to have CCW permit reciprocity, but I don't think this case is how it's going to happen.  In the Obergfell case (on pg. 23 of the linked .pdf), the Court notes that its precedent establishes the idea that fundamental rights must be narrowly framed.  So at issue in Obergfell was not ""the right to same-sex marriage,"" but the right to marriage generally.  In the CCW permit reciprocity context, the fundamental right is ""the right to keep and bear arms,"" not ""the right to keep and bear a concealed firearm, for which one has a state-issued permit in their home state, in states for which one does not have a state-issued permit.""  In other words, the lack of CCW permit reciprocity does not infringe on the basic right to keep and bear arms.  It's also worth noting that in cases involving the Second Amendment, the Supreme Court has generally characterized the right to bear arms as primarily intended to allow people to protect themselves in their homes. See McDonald v. Chicago and D.C. v. Heller.  There is probably an argument that carrying a concealed firearm while traveling allows one to protect their property away from home, but I'm not sure how strong it is.    The article also mentions how states honor driver's licenses issued by other states, but that's not completely true.  Most states do not continue to consider an out-of-state license to be valid after the license holder has lived in the new state for some period of time.  I moved  across the country about two years ago, and had to replace my old license within 90 days, even though it was still valid in the issuing state for another three years.  I suppose you could make the argument that since states honor out-of-state licenses for short periods of time to allow travel through all 50 states, all states should have to honor out-of-state CCW permits for the same reason.  But the counter argument is that you're allowed to own and transport firearms in all 50 states, but some states require you to do things like keep them unloaded or locked when doing so, meaning that even in more restrictive states, your fundamental right to own firearms is not violated."

Heller outright forbade firearm lock/material deprivation of access to firearms by law, because it interfered with the right in the home, where the function of the right was most 'acute'.  That Jackson wasn't heard, and then followed by States going and writing lock laws is an outcome SCOTUS had to have known would happen.  My suspicion is that because Heller and McDonald preceded the climate of the Sandy Hook shootings and the like, the Justices (particularly Kennedy) are now feeling very uneasy about what they've written.  Anything from the 'common use' standard (if semi-automatic handguns are protected because they're a ""class"" of weapons in common use for 'traditionally lawful purposes', then ar-15 pattern rifles and semiauto rifles clearly are also), to the majority opinion stopping very short of saying public carry is a right just as carry within the home (Scalia actually invoked an opinion Ginsburg had written whereby she said bearing a weapon meant to carry that arm on one's person for the purpose of use in an armed confrontation, and that's what the constitution meant by 'bear' as well.), to McDonald's incorporation of Heller against States (and cities, like NYC...) individually or taken together makes a lot of firearms laws look questionably constitutional in ways that I strongly suspect the Supremes weren't uncomfortable with, or had on their radar, prior to the Sandy Hook shooting.  Ginsberg has shown her hand of being not just concerned about legacy, but wanting to see certain policy decisions as a result of SCOTUS pronouncement already, I'd imagine Kennedy (he's getting old) is that way, too."

gunpolitics,3bh5jx,ChopperIndacar,3,Mon Jun 29 16:17:43 2015 UTC,"I'm also actually really worried about Heller.  Scalia (and those who signed on to the majority) bought hook, line, and sinker, the notion that Miller's language about military type weapons useful to a militia and commonly used for traditional purposes excluding short barrelled shotguns but being a ""startling"" reading if it called into question the NFA's prohibition on machinegun ownership (which the court ignores was actually just a regulatory tax not yet a ban via the closure of a tax registry in 1986) presents all sorts of problems.  First of all, it separates the historical notion (which the Court does at least allude to in the Holding), that the purpose of the second amendment was the hope of the anti-Federalists; the frustration of a monopoly on security forces by government, from the modern practice (essentially by opening up the possibility that machineguns can be banned and this comports with the 2A framework, despite their operation being central to any modern military's doctrine of small unit fire and movement)  Furthermore:   The fuck is common use?  Even looking past the preference of Miller's language for 'common use' over military arms for militia usage  (so SBRs aren't protected because, not because of disuse to a militia, but because they're not common use), Heller leaves totally undefined what ""common use"" is.  http://www.edmunds.com/car-reviews/top-10/top-10-best-selling-vehicles-for-2012.html  According to industry data, the F-150 and the Toyota Camry clearly stand out as ""commonly"" owned vehicles, if we're to accept the notion of sales as 'common use' and presence in the public.  But then what about , PDF WARNING , BATFE's own data on manufacturer's sales through FFLs?  https://www.atf.gov/file/55191/download  Pretty obviously, AR-15s are ""common"" as well.  Okay, so maybe 'common' just means the type of gun.  But if we look at vehicular data, and talk about, I dunno, gasoline combustion engine automatic transmission vehicles as a ""class"" of vehicles in common use, box magazine fed, semi-automatic, centerfire weapons are far and away the most common weapons sold.  But is SCOTUS prepared to say AR-15 rifles (sold by Colt with 20 and 30 round magazines since 1963, and joined by a huge number of manufacturers since) are protected by the Second Amendment as a ""class"" of weapons Americans must be able to own?  And furthermore, what's the scope of commonality?  Here in NYC, no firearms can be described as 'commonly' owned, much less those specifically banned by name.  Is NYC or NYS allowed to continue bans on those firearms because they're not common here?  Is California allowed to boostrap into illegality any future pistols via their roster-approval method? Making firearms scarce for purchase inherently upholding their ban of them since they aren't well represented?  I know Heller and McDonald really pushed forward US firearms rights back into acceptance, but holy moly, there's so much wrong with them.  I'm almost happy SCOTUS hasn't been taking on any more 2A cases post- Abramski.  /rant"
gunpolitics,3bh5jx,lolmonger,5,Mon Jun 29 15:58:13 2015 UTC,Yeah I hate the common use argument. Something can be banned because its not in common use because its been banned. Its a argument that allows long standing bans to remain in place.
gunpolitics,3bh5jx,Dantedamean,3,Mon Jun 29 17:04:45 2015 UTC,"And furthermore what the fuck is a ""traditionally lawful purpose"".  Pretty obviously the Patriots shooting British troops wasn't 'lawful', but that capacity is exactly why the 2A was written in; so Colonial militias which rebelled against the British could live on in the citizens' militia, separate from government controlled security forces.   If that's a traditionally lawful purpose, this ignoring of the type of military weapons useful to a militia committed by NFA and further by Miller is totally out of whack."

Say it multiple times, a thousand if that is what it takes to finally get that he is not pro-gun in any way beyond a vague Fudd-ish sense.  He's against so-called ""Assault Weapons"" and against private sales.     I cast what I think was a pretty brave vote banning assault weapons, doing away with the gun show loophole and fighting for instant background checks so that we make sure that guns do not fall in the hands of those people who should not have it     Understand what he is saying:  he was not pressured into thinking he had to vote that way, in fact he felt he was ""brave"" (whatever that means) for doing so which implies he felt he was standing up for something.  You don't fight for something you are against or even on the fence about; you fight for what you believe in.     Sanders said he comes from a state where gun rights are important to people, and he underscored the importance of a ""national dialogue"" to bridge the gap between those who disagree sharply in the debate over gun laws.     Translation:  Death by a thousand papercuts; we have all seen this tactic before.  We come to the table with gun grabbers and compromise with them meaning we give up some rights to make them happy.  Then they get upset about something else they want gone and we are expected to go to the table and ""compromise"" some more (read: give up more rights).  Rinse and repeat until we have no more gun rights except those you might find in England or Australia.  Yeah bridge the gap meaning we have to keep building the bridge until were on their side of the argument.   ""One thing we can't have, we can't have people demagoguing against folks just because they go out and hunt and they own guns,"" he said. ""On the other hand, rural America has got to understand that guns in Vermont are not the same thing as guns in Chicago, where they're used to kill kids or shoot at police officers.""     Notice ""hunt"" and ""own guns.""  Nothing was said about carrying guns or the right to defend yourself.  He then goes on to explain that maybe stronger gun control is ok in certain areas because there are different problems there such as gang violence.  I hope to hell this finally shuts up the He Aint So Bad arguments I have been seeing in the gun community.  I think he's a much better choice than Hillary and I agree with many of his social platforms but let's stop kidding ourselves that if he gets the job and we have another Sandy Hook that he won't be backing or even driving the anti-gun push that follows.

gunpolitics,3beyn0,lolmonger,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:56:04 2015 UTC,"No, actually it was intended to be in perpetuity.  Without the workers being permanently armed, the Communist state would be attacked by threatened bourgeoisie states, and the Revolution itself would become the very instrument of oppression just overthrown.  Lenin wrote more on this than Marx.  No major attempt at a communist state has allowed firearms ownership outside of the ruling class.  This is why we have seen a universal abject failure of communism, characterized by the rise of a brutal and ruthless bourgeoisie class.  For the common person to be free, they must be armed.  Permanently.  It doesn't matter if you are a capitalist, communist, or anarchist, you must be armed."

But some people think it's going to solve all of our problems. It is not.   In a way, this is worse than O'Malley.  At least O'Malley is upfront about his hatred for gun owners.  Sanders?  He's pretending to play the middle (""sensible gun control"") even as he acknowledges its questionable utility.  For O'Malley, it's a crusade.  For Sanders, it's just a matter of course.  It's easier for the NRA/GOA/NAGR to pull scary soundbites from O'Malley and rile up the troops.  Sanders is being more subtle."

We had to fight tooth and nail to get a fundamental, enumerated right incorporated through the 14A.  Even then, the liberal Justices swore the right didn't even exist.  On the other hand, this week's ruling on gay marriage incorporated a right that really doesn't even exist in the Constitution.  What does this tell us?  That SCOTUS has a tremendous political bias, and they're willing to use it in ways we haven't seen before.  We need to be very careful bringing any more gun cases before them in the near future.  As for concealed carry, we may agree that it's a right.  The courts don't.
