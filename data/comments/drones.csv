The FAA could nail him on that one.  Furthermore:  ""(b) STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of the Administrator to pursue enforcement action against persons operating model aircraft who endanger the safety of the national airspace system. ""  Equipping a remote controlled aircraft with a remotely operated weapon could endanger the safety of the national airspace system.

The problem is that birds are not made of rigid plastic with 4+ metal motors. Most of the time when a bird hits a jet hit it sounds like someone hit the aircraft with a sledgehammer.  Birds will typically bounce off the plane depending on where they hit.  There are numerous pictures of birds going through cockpit windows which are about an inch and half thick.  Now, will a Phantom take out a DC-10 Slurry Bomber.  Probably not.  Can two pounds of rigid plastic and metal hitting something at 200 knots do damage yeah most likely.  Of course we are assuming that it is only phantoms.  I have seen videos of people doing this with 1000mm class carbon fiber multi rotors like Cinestar 8s.  If some enterprising idiot with one of those goes beak to beak with a plane damage will be worse.    Bottom line is that they setup a TFR for a reason to control who is in that airspace and when people that airspace they are adding an additional risk to the aircrews."

Do you know what the fines or penalties are for violating a TFR with a drone?  One of the news reports about a drone in a fire zone about a week ago also said that drone was much higher than what FAA regulations allow. Do you know what the penalty for that violation is?

Both of which the Phantom 3 can do.   Zooming is non-existent on most small UAVs. It's a different animal than the SR71 or GlobalHawk. Apples and oranges.  You can fly mutlirotors high enough to not be heard very well if at all in some environments.  Someone in another sub said that 400ft altitude would render the Phantom as silent to the ground.  That said, I believe they can be a privacy threat but it really boils down to the intention of the pilot and the reception of the people being filmed (or potentially being filmed).  IOW, if a pilot decides to fly his drone over a wall into a private nudist colony, then it's a privacy concern.   or  If some crazy person at the park sees you flying it just for fun and believes you are up to no good, they might confront you as it's a privacy issue TO THEM.   You /u/seattledreamer may understand that a copter at 400ft with no zoom at 1080p mostly useless for espionage purposes, but not everyone understands this.

Remove the cameras from the equation: simply flying over private property with a drone is going to be a contentious issue.  At what height does simply ""ferrying"" over private property become ok. Drone collisions in public property.  Here is a scenario: two separate mountain bikers each have a drone following them, the drones collide ruining a few thousand dollars worth of 4k video equipment.   Using drones for hunting reconnaissance.  Motion activated game cameras are usually allowed.  What about drones? Using drones to flush out game while hunting.  Using drones while fishing: a drone could cast a lure, or a different lure, further and into places that might be hard to cast to normally (say, very far away, under cover).  Even if the lure is connected to a traditional fishing rod, and the drone just drops the lure off, what are the ethical and legal implications ""Drone"" implies somewhat autonomous vehicles.  Right now military drones have a human pilot controlled remotely for the most part.

drones,3daa3c,irockhoes,2,Tue Jul 14 18:46:45 2015 UTC,"I'd go with the 3d Robotics IRIS+. The Phantom 3 - while amazing for indoor flights and much better than the others - won't have the same payload capacity or battery life under conditions associated with payload. I wouldn't even consider the Phantom 2 or 1 if you're flying indoors at all.   I think you should also focus your work into fixed wing aircraft. They will be cheaper and likely to be used by more people in the short-term as the control software continues to develop. Also, their Ke transfer is higher at times and makes for a more complex, and in a way, interesting ""cause harm"" scenario."
drones,3daa3c,Slagard,2,Tue Jul 14 20:08:27 2015 UTC,"2 Kgsor 4.5 pounds is more than realistic.  Most multirotors you can have an onscreen display which gives you parameters such as speed, altitude and heading.  Probably want to get something in the 550mm to 600 frame size for added safety. You can build a DJI 550 flame wheel hexacopter (6 rotor)  that can handle 2kg for under $1000 with the DJI Naza flight controller, or the 3DR Pixhawk.  Both allow for an onscreen display to mate with a small FPV nose camera.  The 3DR has a data down link radio where it can paired to a laptop or a smart device through blue tooth."
drones,3daa3c,fluffykittycat,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:36:23 2015 UTC,"The Phantom 3 sounds like a good choice. It provides everything you're looking for... stability, live flight information (app), and it can take a little bit of a beating. The Phantoms are commercially available and are actually quite common. Hope this helps a little. Not anything you couldn't find yourself, but I thought an opinion might help."
drones,3daa3c,turbojoe26,3,Tue Jul 14 19:04:06 2015 UTC,"To add on to this, 2 kg is probably not feasable on a phantom (I don't even believe it weighs that) and really anything within the 1000ish price range not custom built/designed...    Also, the phantom 3 has to come with a camera, so unless you want each one to include a camera, youre wasting probably 500-750 per phantom 3 purchase as you'll just take them off and not use them  I think the 3D Robotics IRIS+ Might be better. Its cheaper, more open source, more durable, parts are readily available and seems a bit more open to custamization.   If you had to purchase a few different types, I would say: The 3D robotics Iris+, 3D Robotics Solo, DJI Phantom 2, DJI Phantom 3, Blade Chroma, and Yuneec Q500.  Those are the most common few"

If he likes to build things/electronics and you don't mind him getting into the hobby, I'd get him a $50 Syma x5 or Hubsan x4 to practice flying and then a 250 racing kit from MiniQuadBros.com or a similar DIY.

You need a gimbal to mount the gopro and they vary in price, quality and features. My gimbal is a pretty good one and cost around $400 but there are less expensive ones. The one I have is listed as recommended on the page and costs 389.99 from bestbuy.  The P2 will be more expensive to make it FPV than other options, but it allows you to get there at your own financial pace. To get FPV with the P2 you will also need: Gimbal, Camera, wireless RX and TX for the video, Screen to view it on.   the Phantom is not fast or good for racing, it is very good for photography though. It is pretty good for a beginner but something smaller and cheaper would not be a bad idea too. What do you think he will use it for? If I know what he is interested in doing, I can help match you up to a UAS better suited for that."

Are you more interested in getting flying or building something yourself?  It can be cheaper to get started with something like a Hubsan X-4 and then do a build. The Micro-X is about the only 'kit' in your price range I can think of- has minimal soldering. With a larger budget you could go for something like a Spedix S250. With both of these you'll need to add a transmitter, plus batteries/charger for the S250 which pushes the initial cost to $150-300.

Now the pilot only needs to posses Sport Pilot certificate with a valid drivers licence in lieu of a class 3 medical.  I have a request for one in the cue.

That would imply anything from a Lighter than air, Glider, fixed wing and or rotor wing.   My guess is that the FAA is not concerned with what type of aircraft you have been trained on.  They probably are more interested in the fact that you have had formal flight training and passed an examination on that training in the areas covered in the exemption."
drones,3cucic,2Skies,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:36:55 2015 UTC,"Actually you don't need a pilot's license.  As part of your S333 request, you can add an exemption to rule 14 C.F.R. 61.113(a) & (b): Private pilot privileges and limitations: Pilot in command   As was found in Exemption No. 12045, “The FAA has previously declared that additional manned airship experience of a commercially certified pilot would not correlate to the airmanship skills necessary for similarly proposed operations in previously issued exemptions to this regulation through Exemption Nos. 11062 and 11138.”"
drones,3cucic,fluffykittycat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:06:45 2015 UTC,"You are correct in the the sense petitioner does not require a Commercial Pilot Certificate  They do need to have at a minimum of a sport pilot cert.  In the case of Mr Trudau 11138. who was Granted exemption he has to get a pilot to fly for him.  I looked at  11062 as well none of them mention anything about airships. Edit:  I believe this is a typo from 12045 I think they meant airmanship.   Here is an excerpt from the FAA document stating how to apply for one.   Section 333 does not provide flexibility for the statutory requirement to hold an airman certificate under § 44711. Therefore the PIC, who has final authority and responsibility for the operation and safety of the UAS flight, must possess the appropriate airman certificate asprescribed by 14 CFR part 61 for the proposed operation and the appropriate medical certificate as prescribed by 14 CFR part 67  I believe all of these request they were arguing that the additional training of a commercial pilot was not going to add any benefit.  If you read 11062 it goes into great lengths arguing this.  It looks like 11062 is the most involved petition request I have seen.  Probably because they were one of the first and ALPA and few other organizations were throwing a lot of push back on the public comments portion.    His specific exemption does say the operator needs one that I directly cut and pasted below.   13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport, commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver’s license issued by a state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in 14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.  Here is another interesting tidbit on 12045.    He sought relief to operate on production sets.  However, he was denied that request. It looks like the only legal operation for him is to use the aircraft for aerial data gathering."

It seems they are approving a lot of folks who don't even mention licenses at all in their paperwork."
drones,3cucic,fluffykittycat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:23:32 2015 UTC,"I think you correct on that for some companies.  However, some people maybe declaring who their pilot is in the company operating manuals.   The FAA is holding these confidential by the request of a of the petitioners.  Although, having said that, I was approached by a gentleman who wanted to fly under the guise of my 333.  He wanted to pilot the system.  He wanted me to break the rules figuring that the people on set would not care who the actual pilot is as long as the company has a 333.  That is a huge fallacy.  The major studios are not screwing around.  They have a checklist to make sure company has 333 as well the pilot on set posses a pilot certificate as well as a log that they have had 200 cumulative flights and that the multi-rotor has a N number."

drones,3cucic,aiurlives,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:48:33 2015 UTC,"I read it over, and by my read, the operator of the UAS must hold an appropriate pilot's license (FAA calls it airman certificate) and a current medical.  If you're doing commercial work, you'd need to hold a commercial pilot's license."
drones,3cucic,fluffykittycat,2,Sat Jul 11 02:00:08 2015 UTC,"But the other link, from February says you'll only need a UAS certificate. So that's what I'm trying to figure out, hoping maybe the FAA document is out of date?"
drones,3cucic,aiurlives,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:06:42 2015 UTC,"The FAA is slow to adapt, so its probably going to be a little while before they have any kind of UAS airman certificate.  The certificate that I believe you are referring to is an airworthiness certificate, which applies to the aircraft, not the pilot.  If you want to conduct drone operations over a crowded area, you need a drone with an airworthiness certificate and it has to be flown by a licensed pilot.  333 exempts you from getting a certification for the aircraft, but it still has to be operated by a licensed commercial pilot.  333 is also limited to ""low-risk, controlled environments.""  https://www.faa.gov/uas/faq/#qn4"
drones,3cucic,fluffykittycat,3,Sat Jul 11 02:20:58 2015 UTC,"A lot of that information on that link is general information.  It does not cover the entire 333.   Currently if the sUAS is under 55 pounds it does not need an air worthiness certificate.  Under this provision the FAA has granted exemptions for the pilot to operate without a commercial pilot rating if they can prove that the operation can be conducted at the same level or greater level of safety as a traditional manned aircraft operation for hire with a commercial pilot.  The argument is that the aircraft is below 55 pounds remains in line of sight  of the operator at all times and does not carry a living thing on it can be conducted safely by a an operator with a sport pilot rating. Also the argument states that because the operation will be conducted in a controlled environment such as a film set which has traffic control measures and prevents non-participating individuals on set, so that the desired level of safety is being achieved.  Because the aircraft is in line of sight and uses safety observers and that the aircraft will not travel far distances it was argued that this achieves that safety as well.  What did the FAA do?  They started granting exemptions for private pilots to do commercial operations with sUAS under 55 pounds.   They exempt the airworthiness inspection requirement if you  in detail describe the flight characteristics of the aircraft.  They exempted the requirement that the aircraft needed a tail number with characters of 2 inches wide 6 high in lieu of a placard or characters that can be visible on the sUAS.  The require a decal indicating the aircraft is still an experimental ac.  They exempt the aircraft to fly as an ""experimental"" for hire.  Experimental aircraft are typically home built kits like the Rutan Long EZ.    If approved a 333 you are now allowed to conduct the specific commercial operations that you outlined in your request letter under a blanket COA.  Under the blanket COA the sUAS must be less then 55 pounds.  Operates at an altitude no higher than 200 feet.   Remains in line of sight of the operator.  Remains outside of 5 miles of an airport that has an instrument approach procedure IAP and a control tower to 2 miles of an airport without an IAP and is uncontrolled.  Any deviation to the blanket COA you have to in writing request a specific COA outlining your deviation and mitigation for safety.  That pretty much sums up the current 333 process at the moment.  Original exemptions were given to private pilots with current class 3 medicals.  Obviously someone's attorney must have argued a sport pilot with a valid drivers licence in lieu of a class 3 medical provided the same level of safety.    My speculation for requiring some sort of airman certificate, is that the holder of that certificate has proven to a competent authority that they can make good pilot decisions, exhibit safety mitigation strategies, understands wording of specific FARS and understands how to navigate in various types of airspace in the NAS.  Currently they will not waive an airman certificate to meet minimum pilot requirements."

drones,3cgnia,jazzynobody,6,Tue Jul 7 19:34:54 2015 UTC,"Yes.  I have a start-up (started at the end of 2011) with the sole intent of being commercial. We spent a good 8 months just doing research--which was a more substantial effort than we originally thought (both co-founders were former USAF officers, one a former drone pilot in the USAF).   Originally, we set out to do just motion-picture and television exclusively.  Then, as technology improved, we decided that survey, inspection, mapping, and precision agriculture were great areas to expand to.   Here's a warning though: make sure whatever business model you invest in is scalable. Most drone companies are not (it's a few-person shop..and those few people can do well, but very little ROI for an investor).  We took zero outside money. It wasn't until this year, with a 333 that we decided to tweak the business model to allow for scaling and take outside money--essentially because 'drones' are very trendy tech right now and people are literally begging to invest. I didn't have anything for them to 'invest' in at the time until we figured out a scalable model.  Keep in-mind, this is on the service-side.   On the manufacturer-side, you would do VERY WELL to put what ever cheddar you can into 3DR if they will let you.  DJI was recently valued at $10B USD!  3DR has smarter folks (I've met many of them), great facilities in San Diego USA (I've visited, it's awesome), and a huge U.S. user-base contributing to code the way we here on reddit contribute to dank cat memes.  Essentially, 3DR is in a ""shut up and take my money"" stage--and I'm still trying to figure out how to do that.  Within one year, they went from the best hobby-grade and hacker-level stuff, to ""every Best Buy in America has a 3DR display and are currently sold out in all 50 states"".  TL/DR; If investing on the service-side, you had better be a partner doing work or find a business that can scale big. If investing on the manufacturer-side, there is real money to be made--but pick your team wisely. :)"

drones,3cgnia,mulletator,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:05:34 2015 UTC,"First you want to have a clear defined mission.  You want to have a realistic goal with the system.  There are many different systems out there that are poised for specific tasks.  Multirotors are great for somethings but not for others.  The multirotor is primarily poised for aerial photography.  Generally the flights are real short in nature ranging from 6 to 30 Minutes, averageing 12 to 15 minutes, depending size of the copter the battery capacity and the weight of the payload, ie camera.    getting into the industry you need a sport pilot certificate which is watered down private pilot cert.  That just recently occurred, when the 333 came out you had to have a Private Pilot in your company.  Next year the FAA promises to have the flood gates open allowing anyone to do it with what appears to be not much more than academic training and a test and a pay a nominal fee.    Equipment can start being costly if you want to operate something more than a flying GoPro. The technology is still IMO is just breaking out of the infancy stages.  It still has a way to go.  We are seeing more robust systems on the consumer/Prosumer market with the DJI Phantom 3/ Inspire 1 and the 3DR Solo. The large rigs still are about where they were 4 years ago with the exception of the Freefly Alta, which is the first professional system to have the automation that the above 3 have.  However upgrading the equipment will not be possible so what payloads it is capable of handling you are stuck with that.  In most cases it will suit the needs of the majority out there who are not flying kitted out Red Epics and Dragons, but can handle a fairly decent DSLR like a Cannon 5D MKIII or a Panasonic GH4.    Once you bridsge the gap between a phantom and start flying the larger legacy rigs like Cinestar 8's and  Skyjib 8's your learning curve is steeper.  You find out that there is alot involved in deciding what motors to buy what is the appropriate propellers and ESC's to get.  Should you fly a 6S battery or should fly a 8S or 12S.    I am speaking gibberish to you which is perfect because that gibberish you need to know well or someone doing this needs to know well if you are going to operate beyond the out of the box solutions.   First thing is what mentioned earlier.  you need to define what the goal is.  Then decide what equipment do you need to fly to achieve that goal.  Then you can narrow down systems to handle it.  Then you need to have someone knowledgeable to operate it for you or you need to invest in lots of batteries and spare parts."

drones,3c04ij,JohnFMoore,2,Fri Jul 3 15:45:46 2015 UTC,"Training will have to be the next chapter to tackle.  Who should be out there doing it?  When I got into this there were no formal avenues to learn how to fly them.  Other then some Universities like UND that have a manned flight training program I am not sure if there really is such an animal out there.  Unfortunately there are a lot of opportunists out there who think they can teach for hire.  The question is are they teaching everything you need to know.  Like the author of this article there really is more to this than just plugging in the battery.    The monkey skills to learn how to fly them are not really too challenging.  What is challenging knowing how to handle them when you start putting heavy payloads like DSLR cameras on them.   You find that you can't just rack it around the sky like you can a phantom.  You have to really think ahead of what you are doing.  Then there is planning for the unseen like how will the system with that 3000-15000 camera handle a lost comm.  What will system do if it loses a motor?  Will recognize in time. Do you have strategies to mitigate damage.    I have been doing it for 4 years.  I have had my share of close calls.  I have seen my copter drop out of the sky because I came down too fast.  Luckily I had enough altitude to fly out of it go to max power and save it 15 above the ground. I had two batteries fail on me in flight.  One happened immediately after takeoff, I was only 10 feet above the ground and got a the battery low warning on my RC controller and the underside lights blinking like mad.  Another situation it was hundred feet in the air and I started getting a battery warnings again.  Started to bring it down when it fell like rock.  Went to full power.  Luckily I was flying over some real soft grass land.  the landing gear had big foam RC tires on them and was able absorb some of the impact with the soft grass.  Had it happened on a hard surface, I would have been buying some replacement parts as well as the camera would have been toast.  There really is nothing you can do ensure you will not have a battery fail in flight.  Some batteries will have a perfect charge and be fully balanced, but once under load where they are delivering 100 amps of current to all motors, once in a while one will burp on you.  So the question is how mitigate the damage?    Those are some of things that you only really get an appreciation for from experience.  Those are the subject matter that need to be present in a real robust training course.  Its easy to learn how to fly when everything works.  Its how you handle adverse situations that separate the pros from the amateurs.  Even after 4 years of doing this there still are things I learn every now and then when I go and fly one of these.  A simple two day to week long course may not be enough to dive head on into the commercial arena especially with the large stuff."

I've already had one 'stuck in tree' event. My reasoning is I can practice with it, learn and have fun and then if I'm still keen can purchase a more expensive model.   It IS a lot of fun."

I'm still pretty green and a bit scared at times but I'm getting better.
drones,3bwytr,SkylineDriver,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:14:07 2015 UTC,"Be smart.  Read the manual and understand all of the functions and flight modes.  Read and understand how the failsafes work.  There are different options to chose for different situations.    Best thing to do is plan out your flight.  Know where the obstacles are.  Think about obstacles that might be in the way if the drone loses comms with your radio and goes into a failsafe mode and goes directly home.  This is where understanding how to set the failsafe up will save you.  If you have an Onscreen display or battery monitoring device try to land before the battery gets to 9.6V of load voltage.  Follow the battery calibration procedures, usually involves measuring the voltage with a Volt meter and setting that number in the DJI assistant.  Practice how fast you can bring it down without it shuttering.  Bringing it down too fast in still air can cause the rotors to stall out in the vortex ring state and it falls like a rock.    GPS is not always reliable.  Never fly over something or someone where if the system loses power and drops will fall on.  Always be thinking if the battery fails right now where is this thing going to drop?  LiPO batteries are very dangerous, don't leave them in the drone when you are done.  They can and have been known to spontaneously explode with no warning even when not plugged in. Store them in fireproof containers or battery bags.   Don't leave LiPos fully charged or depleted for long periods of time like over a week.  The recommended practice is to charge them to half capacity to 60%  This saves your battery life.  Learn your countries rules on where and how high you can fly them.  In the US the max is 400 feet.  For most shots you really don't need to be that high.  I carry Red epics and Black Magics most my shot are raely above 100 feet.  If you are flying around people that are willing participants in being around your flight, brief safety strategies on how and where to take cover if the system goes out of control.  Set up a safety boundary where people stay away from the system when it is armed and ready to fly.   I always tell people never to try to out run it if loses control.  It can go up to 50 to 60 MPH real quick.  Best course is to  run laterally in the opposite direction of flight path.  The idea is to get behind it as quick as possible.  If there is a barrier such as a car to duck down to do so.    For the most part with knowing the system and setting up some risk mitigation strategies they are fairly safe to fly.  You want to keep in mind how to handle things if they go wrong before they actually do."
drones,3bwytr,fluffykittycat,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:54:46 2015 UTC,"Learn about the Intelligent Orientation control IOC or the so called Easy modes like ""Course Lock"" and Home Lock  They require a reliable GPS signal and a calibrated compass.  They have been responsible for pilot induced flyaways.  When activated your RC sticks are no longer directly oriented to the physical front of the system.  Course Lock is designed to allow the system to fly a specific course when you push forward on the stick.  Home Lock acts like an imaginary tether to the home position. No matter where the aircraft is in reference to home or no matter where the nose points pulling back brings it to the home location if it is working as advertised.  I prefer not to use such modes.  How can it be disorienting?  You fly out 200 feet away.  Rotate the nose 90 degrees to the left.  You push forward on the stick expecting to see it move right, or move forward in the monitor but then you notice it flying further away from you.  You become disoriented because the sticks are no longer making any sense you try to use your FPV and and point toawrds yourself and push the stick forward again hoping it will come but it keeps going further away.  OoPs you have it in Home Lock.  If you realize this pull back on the stick and verify in your monitor.  if it is not doing what you want get out of IOC and now drive it home.  Last resort is to use your failsafe mode.  These only work if your system recorded a good home position."

drones,3bw2vt,aerlenbach,3,Thu Jul 2 16:59:51 2015 UTC,"Just a FYI fwiw: I asked the DJI guys in person at NAB if there would be upgrades to the Inspire camera and they looked at me like I was a crazy person. They don't give a FUCK about your camera needs and what you hope to see. They will choose a camera out of convenience, because they don't give a shit what their customers have to say. I asked three people at DJI, 2 chinese high position staffers who barely understood English, let alone how to speak it, and some jaded American dude who didn't know a damned thing about the technology within their drones. I asked, is 60 fps ever going to be available for 4K or even 2K modes?  Again blank stares.  I spoke to 3DR people, and ended up choosing the Solo because everyone at 3DR was smart, and helpful and didn't treat me like I was an inconvenience.  Obviously Inspire is double the cost, with less of the shot type capabilities and automation, so they have to almost repackage the entire system for me to be excited about it. At this point there are so many other companies who will do better than DJI for heavier duty Multicopters for film production especially."
drones,3bw2vt,MunchieMofo,2,Sun Jul 5 07:58:58 2015 UTC,"Its hard to say.  I suppose they may add more sensors and add more automated features.  It would make sense to have maybe a nose camera system for the pilot to keep a constant view in front of the nose.  They could even go as far a stereoscopic camera to fuse data for shot recreation that will require more processing and may up the cost.  A big change maybe to go in another direction.  Instead of being a quadcopter, maybe the next gen is a direct competitor with the freefly Alta where it is a robust 6 motor bird.  Or they can just make a subtle change and just add a better camera system.  When the Phantom 2 came out, it was not that much of a departure from the first gen system."

I can see a future system like the third iteration incorporating some sort of sensor that would mitigate smacking into things like building.  It is plausible sense they are doing the Matrice that some of those features migrate over to other DJI products.  I doubt we will see a radical change in the next inspire.  But I could be wrong.  This is a fast paced market now.  I imagine they are going to try to chase the Solo for the dronesumer/prosumer market and the Alta for pro market in the future."

Its very rigid and can lift 6 pounds with no problem.  To save money if all you are doing is just flying a simple payload you do not need a gimbal. It goes for about 1500 with motors, ESC's and the power distribution board. The motors these come with are a very good motor for large lifting. I use these same motors on an Octo that carries 15 pounds of camera and gimbal with a total weight of 28 pounds.  but you will need batteries and a flight control system.  Probably looking to get a DJI NAZA V2.  A minimum battery you will need will be a 10,000MAh, expect about 12 min of flight time maybe a little more.  Batteries are not cheap.  The run about 250 ish.  You might be able to find some a little cheaper.  Not much You will need a charger which runs around 250 also.  Then you will need an RC controller factor in about 250 to 400 for one of those.    Probably you are looking realistically at a 3000-3500 mark.  You might be able to do this with a large Quadcopter   Here is the link.  http://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/H004-Free-shipping-6-Axis-Hexacopter-frame-kit-with-electrical-items/109347_1506136428.html  Their customer service is second to none for dealing with a Chinese firm.

drones,3bsgpy,fluffykittycat,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:25:25 2015 UTC,You could build a decent system to carry a gopro for around 250 to 400.  This assumes you already have certain items like a decent R/C controller and a good battery charger.  For doing decent videos you will need about 1000 for a good small system.  You can goto Hobbyking and find frames that are respectable for 15 to 30 bucks.  The cost go up depending on how copmplex you want to make it like four motor versus 6.  You could do a Quad w/o gimbal fairly cheap.  Average price   $20 For a 450 Flamewheel knock off frame $80 for four 1000 KV Motors $80 for four ESC's  $ 50 to 150 for a simple flight controller.  Keep in mind the bare bone flight control systems are more buggy and require more technical skills to tune them optimally.  DJI NAza Light with a GPS is around $150 to 200 depending on vendor.  This is probably an ideal choice for a starter drone it has GPS. A decent gopro brushless gimbal 100 to 200. You will need a controller for the lower end ones which run about 100 for a simple 8 bit alexmos   Without getting an RC controller and RC receiver set.  you are looking at a ballpark of about 330 to 450 for just the aircraft.  The RC controllers run from 250 to 1000's Mid range spektrum is $500 and the RC reciver is about 75.  RC transmitter is something you do not really want to skimp on.  There are some real cheap ones out there but they are not as reliable.    Once you start adding things like a video TX/RX set video monitors batteries it starts adding up quick.  If you are real serious about getting into this you are looking at about a 1500 to 2000 investment in equipment. The good thing is once you buy a decent controller battery charger and the video equipment building future systems is not too bad.  Once you decide to go into systems that can carry more than gopros you are looking at spending 2000 to infinity just for the aircraft and gimbals.

Unfortunately, you cannot use UASs for commercial purposes without an FAA Section 333 Exemption, which requires a number of things. I'd look that over and decide if you want to proceed first.  If you do proceed, please make sure you familiarize yourself with the safety features of your drone, and the general rules for safe flying prior to using it; it's not difficult to learn and flying these can easily become dangerous."

drones,3bninn,xavier_505,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:31:25 2015 UTC,"Knee jerk reactions and unnecessary rules are not the answer.  Regulations do need to be in place to hold people accountable for reckless behavior.  I agree with his sentiment that adding more speed limit signs will not stop all people from speeding, more rules will not stop people from flying.  However, using his analogy there are not a lot of signs where I live saying you must ""buckle up.""  But if you caught driving without a seat belt you will get pulled over and either get warning or a ticket.  If you claim that you did not know that was the law you still might get a ticket.  Ignorance is not a valid excuse for violating the law.  Same thing can be applied here.  If one is caught flying over a crowed of non participating individuals without any permits or coordination that person deserves to be fined for putting the public in danger and claiming you did not know the rules is no excuse. If one crashes on top of the crowed, they better hope they have insurance, in addition to the criminal charges that are already in place in most jurisdictions that person now has incurred a civil liability.  I think a healthy balance of rules and education are the only tools we have to keep the public safe.   I think current proposed rules from the FAA is a rational approach.  However those rules will only affect those who seek to do it for hire.  The FAA may need to revise a strategy on how to control the non-commercial aspect of it. Few years ago before there were drones, there were RC hobbyists.  Those people were relatively small in numbers.  Those interested in getting into it, sought the experienced people from the AMA chapters.  They learned how to fly them safely, learned the rules from the FAA circulars and they stuck to flying mostly at designated fields.  Back then they put their own time and money in building planes from scratch and learning the ins outs of the systems. Even when the word drone came about, you had for the most part put it together yourself, solder wires make sure and you had the circuit boards plugged in correctly.  You had to learn how to tune the system and all the ins and outs with very little documentation. Use of the forums and the community helped.  It was a humbling experience coming from a traditional aviation background I thought it would be a cakewalk.  It took a bit of time to learn it.  Now you can just buy an off the shelf system without even thinking twice about what even what makes these things work.  Charge a battery, plug it in and let it rip!  The manufactures are now sort of getting on board but a few years ago they weren't.  In fact at the production conference NAB held in Las Vegas in 2013, I overheard a company rep for a notable drone maker tell some people how easy it is to fly these and that if you get into trouble just shut controller off and it will just fly back to you and land itself.  Well there are countless videos on the internet that show that statement not to be always true.  So they have planted the seed for people to not have a real respect for the system.  Your average joe will just absorb what they hear and not think twice about it.  I am sure that the guy in Seattle now is shaking in his boots wondering when at any minute when the cops will come knocking on his door with handcuffs and an arrest warrant. I am sure he is thinking about it now but damage is already done.  In some cases his actions may help improve safety as when these happen people who fly them become more aware of the dangers involved and hopefully will think twice about flying over dense crowds.    There are three types of sUAS drone pilots.  The RC hobbyist who respects safety, manages risks and learns the system.  Then there are those who want to do it professionally, realize its not a toy and learn from those doing it. They take their time to practice before diving in head first.  Last there is the ""Dronesumer,"" who just thinks its neat, buys one off the shelf from X,  does not bother to read the manual learn the ropes or even understand its limitations.  That guy is the one who possibly ends up on Youtube or the news doing some stupid bafoonery.  The goal for all of the above 2 should should be to make number 3 at least behave in a manner that is consistent with the safe operation of these.  There needs to be some control for number 3."

I Seem to be fine. no big deal.  that is likely how that WOULD have ended if we did not have this paranoid demonization of this things to contend with.  it was pretty dumb to fly that close to buildings. aerodynamics makes them magnets for little aircraft :-)  in a situation like that I would only fly my bebop or my 262. IE something that literally could not hurt you.  I assume this was a phantom? they are heavy enough to knock you for a loop if they hit you just right."
drones,3bmnau,JohnFMoore,2,Tue Jun 30 13:21:51 2015 UTC,Those are good tidbits especially his safety guidelines on where not to fly like crowds and airports.  I ll add a couple.   Learn what all of the flight modes do and their limitations of whatever system you buy. Learn how the failsafes modes work.  And chose the one that makes the most sense for the area you are shooting. As part of your shot planning ask yourself if the copter loses RC comms what might be in the way when it wants to come back.   Keep note of your battery state. Space weather.  Consider space weather issues if there are high K indexes that might degrade GPS and communication. If you never touched one of these before ask questions on forums on anything you don't understand.

drones,3bkb3f,APOSTATEDENIER,4,Mon Jun 29 22:34:37 2015 UTC,"First and foremost read the manual in grave detail.  Understand what every function is and how it works. If something does not makes sense then go on forums or here and ask questions.  Know the limitations of the system components.  Follow the warnings closely.  Understand what makes these lose link with the handheld controller.  Understand that the systems like GPS are not fool proof don't always work in certain environments like congested urban centers.  Take a look at space weather.  If the K index is higher than 3 there is potential for issues with Nav and GPS.  Understand battery safety LiPos are dangerous.  Don't fly over crowds or non-participating people.  Don't be that guy!  Memorize what the blinky lights mean.  Read the manual for the overall components of the system like the ESC's and IMU and compass.   For the first few time using it.  Take it somewhere remote or an AMA designated field and keep the leash on it.  Don't fly too high or too far.  Keep it where you can easily keep track of it.  Get used to how quick you get it back down out of altitude.    Always have situational awareness of what the aircraft is doing at all times.  Understand how to set your battery limits to give you enough warning to land.  If something inadvertantly occurs where something like the battery fails in flight, believe me they can!  Make sure the copter falls onto something that you wont regret like someones property or worse on a person.    If you do fly around people make sure they are all participating in your flight and that you brief safety stragtegies of how react if it goes out of control.  Learn how to fly in all orientations and be careful to not get confused in the controls.  Do not over rely on the GPS and fail safes.  Understand how to set up failsafes for specific situations.  Some situations you want it to fly home.  Other situations you do not.  The system is only smart as what has been programmed into it.  Know how it will fly back to home point on its.  If you did not plan a good altitude to climb back to it may crash into an obstacle like a building or a mountain.  This is where letting it hover in place and land may be the best option. Test out how all of the systems work in a controlled environment so you do not crash the copter.  Above all don't be that guy that plugs in a battery and just lets it rip down the road a half mile and hope it comes back.  Don't be that guy!"

drones,3bkb3f,fluffykittycat,3,Tue Jun 30 00:39:41 2015 UTC,"If would have realized your background I would have tailored my response a bit differently.  Anytime I read someone buying the DJI ""Phantom Menace""  i automatically assume that person never touched anything aviation before.  For an experienced R/C guy there are some differences.  Namely in the sense that the system is more automated has no aerodynamic flight capability once it looses main battery power like auto rotation.  Pay particular attention to the flight modes called ""Intelligent Orientation Control""  These provide a more simple way to fly without having to know where your nose is pointing.  One is ""Course Lock,"" which remembers the position of your nose direction when you activate it.  The sticks will always respond as if you nose is planted in that direction.  Meaning if you takeoff and nose out and turn it on and rotate the nose 90 degrees, your copter will tilt left and right as if the nose was still pointing forward.  Read up on the exact particulars I may have some of the sequence wrong.  I cant remember if it goes by the compass direction on takeoff or if it goes by the compass direction when activated.  I don't use these features on my DJI Wookong-M.    The other IOC is ""Home Lock""  This puts an imaginary theater like a kite on a string from the home position for the copter. No matter where it is in space pulling back will always pull it toward the home position.  This one only works if you have a good GPS lock and it records home point which will be indicated by a momentary change in the light bulb color.  Important to know about IOC is that these modes are responsible for pilot induced flyaways because if you inadvertently have one activated and don't realize it you may lose orientation real fast and cause it to go way further away.  Home lock may or may not save you so it is best to make sure what modes you are in before you take off.  One practice that prior R/C guys do that does not work well with the multi-rotor is timing your battery for the sole purpose of determining how much power you have left.  This is because the system is governing the throttle for you and when you push up on the throttle you are not commanding the motor RPM's you are commanding a climb rate.  When the stick is in the middle it is commanding a hover.  When you pull back you are commanding a specific descent rate and pushing forward for the climb rate.    For the battery you want to take a volt meter when it is fully charged and set that voltage in software for the Phantom.  Otherwise it may not know the true battery state.  Generally when you do it once it is pretty close, but I would check it from time to time that what the system is telling you is in fact what the battery has on board.    Real time battery voltage can be monitored by an iOSD mini which overlays flight information to your FPV monitor.  The goal is to land somewhere in the ball park of 9.6V Load voltage.  Anything less than 9.6 may damage the battery as it will progressively start pulling more current until it is fully depleted. 9.6 Load is the point where the system is pulling the max current for a hover before exponentially degrading.  You probably want to set a buffer based off of your flight profile.  If you plan on flying real high plan on having the system try land with a higher voltage.  The goal is to beat the system to the landing.    If you are descending in still air or are letting it descend by drifting naturally with the wind you need to descend with a lower rate or else you get into vortex ring state stalls.  This is where the copter flies into its own vortex generated air that will wrap around the propellers starting from the root and extending to the tips.  As it get exacerbated it exponentially gets worse where the rotors will be almost in a complete stall and it will fall like a rock.  Early detection of this is when that you will see the copter start to shutter and the props start sounding choppy, when coming down.  If detected early it can be shunted by a rapid power increase.  If it still falls with power you will need to fly out of it preferably into the wind to get it out of the dirty air.  The best way to avoided is to descend with airspeed into the wind.  If you are only going up no more than a hundred feet it is not too difficult to bring down safely.  That would be something to practice and find that point on your throttle stick where it will start shuttering then note that position.  If you follow that for the most part you should be covered."

In fact the wow factor of just flying it for the sake of flying it may get old real quick.  At least it does for me.  I only like flying when I am on set doing a challenging shot.  After the new car smell wears off it becomes pretty routine like anything else.  The big ones still give a pucker factor because there is more money hanging in the air.    I imagine a guy who has been flying R/C will get to that point as well.  You will probably find out that you will be more interested in getting some good footage versus just flying it around.  The key thing that you will have to fight will be the complacency factor from your previous experience once the multi become natural.

You're probably gonna top out at 10-12, and if you want to stay in the field longer you'll need to buy more batteries, and maybe a portable USB charger. As far as FPV (First-Person View, what they call it when the camera streams to a device), you can get that under $300. Still, I'm going to give you the same advice I give everyone in this sub who asks how to start: don't over-invest. You're gonna crash it. A lot. Get a cheap one you're not afraid to kill (, and fly it around. Crash it, and learn to repair it. Then step up to your $200-$300 beginner's FPV model. I'm seeing a cheerson cx10 for $15 on banggood right not. It's probably a piece of crap, but at that price point it might be worth getting just so you can get a feel for how these fly. If you wanna spend a bit more I had a wonderful experience with my hubsan x4 before I threw it into the woods, and they're only like $50. When you feel you're ready to graduate to something a little bigger and more powerful, I'd recommend the dromida ominus. Around $200, with a 2mp camera and FPV. It zooms, man. I like mine a lot."

You will need to invest in a RC radio system that can run abou 250 to 500 dollars or more depending on how sophisticated the transmitter is.  FrSky makes an open source for a couple hundred bucks.  At a minimum you will need at least 6 channel radio to actuate the different flight modes.  I say this a minimum for most of the starter flight controllers.  The radio can get expensive.  You can get a lot of parts cheap to build a starter frame from Hobby king.  The fram and motors without a flight controller run a few hundred dollars.  There are various types of flight control systems out there from the very basic to some more advanced ones.  Cheap flight controlers run about 50 to 70 dollars for simple KK or Multiwi setups.  They are limited in they can do and require a little of knowledge in how to tune them.  More advanced controllers with GPS capability run anywhere from 250 to 1500.  At your level starting out you would be best to buy a commercial closed source system like a DJI NAZA lite.   To do this for fun other than just flying around the house.  The cost will start adding up.  You have to keep in mind that you need batteries and chargers and expect to have lots of spare equipment when things go wrong.  For the money you are limited mostly to small simple ready to fly kits as the other posters have mentioned."

drones,3bfehh,drunkadvice,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:16:59 2015 UTC,Bad news: It is possible your battery will be permanently damaged somewhat from draining it so low.

drones,3bfehh,terminalcomputer,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:52:07 2015 UTC,Yup 12.6 is the max charge.  you probably ruined the battery I would not use it no more.  You run the risk of it catching on fire or having a cell spontaneously fail in flight causing a crash. Be careful with LiPo's because if you do not know what you are doing you can really cause some damage.  You should never allow the load voltage to go below 9.6 V.  What is load voltage you might ask?  That is the voltage that you see when flying your copter at different power levels.  You will see the load voltage at 9.6 but when you land and shut the motors off you should see the resting voltage go back up to 11.1 or a little higher.  That does not mean the battery magically recharged itself.  That means that is the resting voltage when not pulling the current from the ESC's.  You probably were confused by the battery label which said your battery is 11.1v.  Different companies put the battery voltage specs differently.  Some companies show the Min resting voltage of 11.1 for a 3S that is 3.7V per cell in series.  Other companies report a max voltage of 12.6 which is 4.2 V per cell.  When you are not using the battery for extended periods of time it needs to be charged at half capacity upto 60%  Most chargers have a store mode so use that.  Keeping a lipo battery fully charged or fully discharged for long periods of time will cause the battery to shorten its life cycle over a period of time.   Google LiPo battery fires. and LiPo safety.

drones,3beona,fluffykittycat,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:55:51 2015 UTC,"I would take the body apart and look at the electronics.  If the controller wont connect anymore could mean that the RC receiver disconnected  to the IMU.  It sounds like you may need to buy a new body shell if the motor is misaligned. It is not a good idea to try to fly it if the motor alignment is off.  It will significantly affect the performance, perhaps even causing it to yaw out of control.  At a minimum a misaligned motor will cause the other 3 motors and ESC's to work harder potentially causing a premature failure in them.    Also you will want to make sure the motor barrings are not damaged.  You can do a motor test in the software, props off and see if it sounds like it is running smooth.  If there looks like one motor has excessive wobble it means that motor may need to replaced or you might need to find a barring replacement for it.  Excessive wobble may cause problems with the IMU components."

The key part your friend missed is that while the quadcopter does have a ""ground"" (""negative"" or ""return"" would be more appropriate here) it is completely independent of the power transmission system. There will not be any voltage difference between the power line and the quad.  You can test this by taking two quadcopters, and connecting the +V power from the battery on one to the ground on the other. No problems, because the circuits are independent."

drones,3b7uvz,fluffykittycat,2,Sat Jun 27 13:10:06 2015 UTC,Could be your I gain is too high. The I value is what accelerates the system to the desired set point so if you deflect the stick and release it depending on the value determines how fast it will try to reach the desired position.  If it is too high it can cause an overshoot.  I would bring your I gain down in small increments.  The P gain tells the aircraft how much deflection in roll or pitch you desire.  The I gain tells it how fast to get there.  Usually the I gain value is significantly less than the P value.  If the aircraft is real floaty than the P is too low if it jitters and shutters the P gain is to high.  If it reacts to fast and overshoots the I is too high.  If the I is too low it will move slow to get to the desired pitch or roll angle.  Self leveling is probably might need to be adjusted as well.  Do one change first and see how it reacts before you mess with the other settings.  I would dial it down a little and see if that helps.  Yawing on its own usually is caused by disturbances in the magnetometer.  If the motors are not straight that can induce yaw as well also winds can cause the aircraft to wind vane sometimes. Lowering the yaw gains down make it less reactive to changes or disturbances coming from the magnetometer or compass.    if you are using a GPS system.  They don't always lock in place perfectly they can drift around a bit depending on how robust the GPS radio is and if there is any influence on the GPS from the environment.  The thing moving by itself could be the self leveling gains are too high and overshooting as well.    overshooting from the I value can cause oscillations.  In some cases if I too high the aircraft can become unstable and go out of control.

I started on a Cheerson CX-10 and graduated to a DJI Phantom 1 and not only found everything incredibly intuitive, but after navigating the Cheerson through the hallways of my house and landing it regularly on the kitchen table, the more sophisticated Phantom was an absolute piece of cake to pilot.  They're not absolutely comparable, but I think flying the mini drone definitely helped me when I finally upgraded."
drones,3b60an,fluffykittycat,2,Fri Jun 26 19:43:31 2015 UTC,"Phantoms I suppose are very stable and much more user friendly than the systems in the past three years.  It is not a bad idea to learn some of the raw fundamentals on how these things fly.  I started out with a very cheap Blade MQX simple quad.  By flying it around I was able to see the effects of what happens if you bring it down too fast to the point where even at max throttle it still hits the ground.  This was a bahavior that translated to the next copter I started learn on and that was a Cinestar 8 Medium lift air frame.  One of things that the blade taught me was that if the copter is heavy it will not just descend in no wind straight down real fast. The rotors experience a phenomenon called vortex ring state.  This is where a ring of air that is being produced by the rotors start wrapping around the propellers when descending into your own wash too fast.  You can see this even in a phantom when trying to come down too quickly when the copter starts to shutter.  If you don't catch it in time the copter will fall out of the sky like a rock.  That is one example of one of the benefits of learning how to fly these them.    The detractor on learning how to just fly these systems is that they are simple and don't have modes like IOC where your oriented always to a specific compass heading like course lock or your home location like home lock.  A lot of people don't read the manuals to understand how these modes work.  Also a lot of people don't bother to comprehend how the different fail safe systems work, so they are surprised when the copter does not come back to them because they had it configured wrong in the DJI assistant.    Long story short, do you absolutely need to do this?  Well that depends.  A phantom is not a bad starter.  However, it behooves those who never flew one before to read the manual. Ask questions on anything that they don't understand on the various multirotor forums.  Fly with baby steps first in areas where you can mitigate the damage if something happens.  It is good to learn a comfort level of how everything works before letting the leash off and just letting it rip.  Or you end up here or one of the many forums asking why did my phantom just crash?"

Not the top of the line, but no cheapies either. Get a few spare blades.  It depends on what you want to do with it. Fly around and drop water balloons on people.  Race them.

None of the well-reviewed, inexpensive quads are hard to control, unstable, crash-prone or so particularly underpowered.    You might consider looking up the calibration procedure for whatever cheap quad you have.  You should be able to hit the throttle and have it go straight up with no trim once it's calibrated.  Using trim screws everything up and makes the quad a lot harder to fly  I've also built a few micros with upgraded motors etc.  Now THOSE are fun, but NOT for beginners.  They're faster so they crash faster.  Good advice to recommend extra props.  Those cheap and always a winner."

But my knowledge about  'degrading' GPS precision on a system that requires it for failsafe is a failure.  A monetary 'glitch' which can be tens of feet in severe solar storms on consumer-grade GPS is enough to take a DJI A2, Wookong M, or any other controller into whack mode. Single Event Latchup is another major issue... and of course comms.   If the controller's comms aren't communicating, the aircraft 'should' go into failsafe--but if both compass and GPS are off (or, worst case, an SEU), the aircraft doesn't know where to go. I've seen flyaways happen in these circumstances.     And, please don't think I'm trying to be antagonistic... I'm not trying to; I'm here to share best practices.

drones,3b5qan,fluffykittycat,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:50:51 2015 UTC,"I will chime in here.  I have a wireless comm background as well.  I am also a former pilot that has over 1500 flying transoceanic and 2000 hours flying RPA's.  First, not sure where you get the idea that space based and/or terrestrial systems can't be degraded.  They sure can.  Couple things occur.  One is if the solar wind is powerful enough it will distort the geo magnetic field and cause it to bombard equipment with what is referred to as killer electrons.  They can and have been so intense that they cause microelectronics components to chemical react and change their state to the point where they cause damage to those components.  Not making this up it is in a pier reviewed presentation from the United States Air Force Academy.  Secondly, in space the solar wind is packed full of particles that they can cause a momentary jump in an electron  state in something like a transistor.  This causes a phenomenon known as latch-up.  This is where the the transistor is momentarily shunted from efficient current flow.  That circuit element is in effect offline.  If powerful enough, it damages it completely.  GPS does become unreliable.  You can actually see a demo of that from Holger the founder of Mikrokopter in Germany, where he turned the system on during a CME that only produced K index of 5 effecting GPS.  The copter was on the ground and they were monitoring its position on a laptop map.  In 2 minutes the copter that had not physically moved an inch showed that it had traveled 30 meters away from the original position.  Also because the magnetosphere was being distorted the compass was being affected as well.  So couple that with the aircraft getting garbage from the GPS and erroneous compass data the system's 16 bit processor may not be able to discern it.  When the magnetic field is strong enough and is being distorted it causes spikes in reverse current so bad that it has taken out transformer stations on the ground and other like systems.  The moveing magnetic field is powerful enough in certain regions where it has been known to distort frequencies from the entire spectrum.  Figuring that RC transmitters do not put out a lot of power and are not nearly as robust as telecommunications equipment.  They operate on a very narrow band of the ISM they are extremely prone external disturbances, to the point where high gain wifi antennas can jam them, being too close to other high power microwave sources that have harmonics that can cross into the carrier freq.  Even just flying near strong magnetic fields such as high tension power lines and power transformer stations can cause comm drop out as well as mess with the compass.  Being that CME events have jammed radar systems which operate in the microwave range and other systems across the spectrum it is very plausible that the quarter sized 2.4 GHz RC receiver dongle is very susceptible to space based interference.  As for GPS because of space weather, modern airplanes still fly with Inertial Navigation Units that backup the system and alert the pilot when anomalies occur and even give the pilot a probability of error in those systems called minimum navigation performance.  This is real if the MNP goes to a certain point you have to alert ATC where they may give you an alternate course or altitude change if you might be in a situation where you may cross a lot of traffic.   Not getting into a pissing contest.  I encourage anyone reading not to take yours or my word for it, but maybe the advice from the experts at NOAA space weather and other pier reviewed sources and see that I probably closer on target than you are.    The safe, smart and prudent thing to do when ever there is any anomaly that could effect any of the COM/NAV systems on these, is you ought to not fly and keep the $1000+ investment on the ground.  Takeoffs are optional, landings are mandatory!"

I just get pissy with this subject sometimes because after doing this for 3 years.  It gets old reading about the quintessential jackass that never flew these before and goes out and buys one and crashes.  Then they are on the forums going ""golly gee guys, why did my copter fall out of the sky.""  Anecdotally, I would say that 80% of all multi-rotor crashes I have read about were do to blatant pilot error on the operators part.  I have been to several conferences where I hear the sales guy for company X go ""These are easy to fly, just hit this switch and it comes right back to you.""  Well, not always.    I have seen a real bad practice where people fly out beyond line of sight and hit the failsafe switch to bring it back versus actually flying it back themselves.  Or they hit an unknown switch because they did not read the manual and put it into intelligent/smart mode and lost orientation because they did not realize their sticks now no longer control the real front axis of the copter.  Then there is the vortex ring state where people bring the bird down too fast and stall out the rotors and it falls like rock.  and again they chime in on X forum wondering why it happened.  Don't get me started on batteries and the severe lack of knowledge here.    My take on these systems and how fickle they can be is that anyone wanting to get into it should do a bit research and really understand what they are doing and practice in a controlled environment where they can get a feel for how they perform.    Now that they are sold in Bestbuy's and other places I can only imagine the volume of bafoonery that is going to happen when guy gets his fathers day/birthday/christmass present drone and charges the battery for the first time and lets it rip down the road and smacks into something.

One isto return home at a base altitude of 30m another is to return home at base alttude 30m + user defined height above.  The last option is to simply hover in place and land. Option 3 is useful for certain flight like flying around a twisting mountain road where it will not physically climb over the terrain to get home and the best course of action is to hover in place and land."

It's also larger and easier to see than something like a husban. The plus side is I work in a warehouse and had a large indoor space to fly it. Outside the combination of the lightweight and the large surface area makes it unusable in high wind.  Recently i cut off the prop guards to greatly improve the performance."

(have you read the law?)  this is not a regulatory issue. it is an education issue.  did we ban lasers? no. a few got spanked the public got educated. don't point lasers at planes.  how many stories do you hear of that now?  the drone flyer over the burning house did nothing wrong. he never got in the way he never did anything illegal and I would ignore outright any law that said otherwise.  flying over WILDFIRES is different. they need to use aircraft. this is simply an education thing. nothing more. we need simply educate the public on when not to fly and the VALID REASON.  telling me not to film a burning house ""because you don't want me to"" is not a valid reason.  telling me not to film a wildfire because we have to hault our air operations while you are in the air? MAKES PERFECT sense. that is a valid reason. if it is true. (I am going to take their word for it for now)  wanting ""control"" is not a valid reason. have a legitimate safety issue IS a valid reason.  we do not need regulation. congress originally forbade the FAA from regulating for good reason.  what we would get is the consumer drone regulation. Easier to straight up ban them than deal with them and that regulation essentially bans almost all model aviation!  we depend on people like you to push the truth and to push reason. not to spearhead the fear mongering meaningless junk.  please work on that. YOU have a bigger voice than we do. we NEED you to see reason."
drones,3ayvfd,nerys71,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:07:19 2015 UTC,"I disagree. While a wildfire is a perfect example, TFRs are already in place to make flying in that airspace illegal. It is a matter of education and enforcement, not more regulation.  The burning house is more of a gray area IMO. The UAS was not interfering with the firefighters (they were just annoyed), but you could argue he was infringing on the homeowner's privacy. Somehow the fire makes it seem less intrusive (perhaps b/c a burning house is a spectacle), but had he flown the UAS that close to the house under normal circumstances it would have been inappropriate at the very least.  I doubt the homeowner would feel good that intimate footage of his most prized possession burning to the ground was racking up views on YouTube but that doesn't necessarily mean it should be illegal. Kind of reminds me of the movie Nightcrawler."

Every drop or bump it had would break an arm or the entire body. I exploded into a firework of pieces at least three times. In total, I probably have 48 hours of print time, 45 mins of flight.  There is a reason carbon fiber is the standard.  Now for Micro quads, different story. I would personally recommend buying a $35 hubsan X4 and print one of Bened1kt's (7mm) Dreamcatchers (get the $45 X4 with a camera, 8mm). Desolder the motors to remove from their shell and resolder.

The P2VP has a beautiful camera, and with the correct editing software can easily eliminate the fish eye effect if need be.

drones,3abqgk,psychometrixo,0,Fri Jun 19 12:02:48 2015 UTC,Government fears anything that takes away power from them. this is a simple fact of power gathering not paranoia.  the FAA does not care too much about our drones as long as people stay away from airports and airplanes.  The government is scared shitless of them. I know why the military is scared of them and they also do not care about consumer drones.  on one hand consumer drones can be used against them but those would come direct from china and never pass through the US and therefore us regulations would be irrelevant to them.  The one loophole I see is that this law does not apply to any drones flown under national community standards. it is fascinating that that loophope was put into place.  I see a few national community organizations popping up. I am working on starting one myself.  I don't accept not flying over 400ft and not flying over people (at all) and do not accept having to have anything I fly specifically approved by the government as this regulation would indicate.  look at the backlash police are having to body camera's. it is a backlash to anything that challenges their fabricated narratives on anything they do.

Those can get fast and always want to fly away or slam into ground.  Get him a phantom + cam. They dont fly away, they stay at exactly where they are if you release the controls. They come back from wherever they are on the flip of a switch, when battery is low, or when transmitter is shut off.  $200 wont do, but $400 will. Then he gets someting which has a realistic chance of surviving more than 10 seconds if he follows instructions. Dont buy blade copters, ""safe"" is a lie, they are pushed by dealers only because of high margins."

Since two of your choices are similar to the Syma, I'd say get the Syma. It's one of the two most popular starter drones (the Hubsan X4 is the other). The Syma also has a ton of spare parts available, and trust me, if you plan to have fun with this thing, you better buy a set of extra batteries.

drones,3a03z8,myeggnoodles,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:33:28 2015 UTC,There are so many creative ways drones can be used. I hope the actions of few don't ruin it for the rest of us.
drones,39yas4,Casmiguel,2,Mon Jun 15 19:56:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, you are lacking skill, I'm not trying to be mean.  When I started I did the exact same thing, when I manipulated the throttle I was unaware of my finger moving yaw as well.  Likewise, when I yawed, I'd often destroy my good hover and bounce up and down when I unintentionally moved the throttle as well.  Try this, I don't know how you grip your controller, but I've seen a lot of noobs tightly gripping the controller to where freedom of movement for their thumbs would become restricted and unintentionally keep yawing during throttle movements because their thumbs were getting slightly pulled to one side as they moved it up and down, so maybe try making a big C shape with your thumb and the rest of your fingers, and make sure your thumb has plenty of space to move.  And yes, practice too, it doesn't take long before your brain can lock your fingers in on only one axis and move exactly how you want them too.  You want your thumb to curve into the stick, not lay flat across it.  Like a pianist cupping their hand rather than playing with all fingers flat.  Also, some people don't even use their fingertips but rather pinch the top of the sticks with their thumb and index finger.  The big ""C"" arc is also much easier with a neck strap for the TX, it will take the strain off your hands of having to hold all the weight.  I don't think the Hubsan TX has a attachment point for one though."

drones,39yas4,psychometrixo,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:37:03 2015 UTC,"This happened to me when I had to put a lot of trim on the hubsan to get it to fly level.  Then the trim threw off the yaw.  Solution is to place the half of the Hubsan on a small stack of paper (e.g. just the back two or just the right two legs) and then do the ""throttle to bottom left, right stick wiggle back and forth until the Hubsan blinks"" calibration technique.  The ideal situation is to get it calibrated so it flies properly with no trim.  Once you do that (and it can take a few tries, but nothing crazy), you should be able to spin it like a top.  At least, that worked for me.  YMMV, but good luck!"
drones,39xjg5,PrOxYsTaR,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:45:10 2015 UTC,"Depends on the quadcopter you purchase  Some have ""FPV"" (first person view) so you can see live what's happening.  The racers generally use FatShark goggles to see that, but there are cheaper alternatives.  If you want a quadcopter that will fly by GPS and be able to tell you afterwards just what happened, look into the DJI Phantom or the 3DR Solo.    But remember: GPS-powered quads are not fully bug-free yet.  You need to learn how to fly first.  To learn how to fly a quadcopter, pick up one from Amazon e.g. the Hubsan X4, the Cheerson CX-10, or (if you are serious about learning how to really fly) the Blade NanoQX  Good luck and have fun!"

Just search for FPV quadcopter on google and even on Amazon and see what you're getting into.  FWIW the Hubsan's FPV practice-sized quadcopter is fun and gives you a good idea of how to fly these things.  After you get that down, get ready to plunk down $1200+ for a DJI Phantom or 3DR Solo with FPV capabilities.  Or you can get seriously into the hobby, but again, that takes time and money.  Your best bet is to spend some time looking at Amazon and reviews from there.  Also, come check out /r/Multicopter and look at their FAQ and the communities they link to.  Hope this helps!"

It is a hard drone to keep steady.  It is very light and gets caught up in small winds easily.  It doesn't quite have the power to lock itself into position the way more expensive quads do.  It is a very fun gateway into harder stuff.

Notice that it comes with either a .3 mb camera or a 2mb ""HD"" cam for slightly more- I think it's worth it. Also buy a few batteries for it and the prop guard (like $2). Indoor flying is way better with a guard so that you can bounce off walls a bit and not constantly break props.  I also have a syma x5, very good drone for the money, slightly larger, mostly only for outdoor flight IMO. Camera is similar.

I can't tell you for sure, since it's such a new field.  If you want to get sponsored, it looks like (and I can't say this is how it really is, since I'm not sponsored) you build a small quad, practice for a few hundred hours (like mastering a video game) and post a bunch of videos of you doing things.  If you want to get a job doing this seriously, you're probably gonna need to be connected to someone hiring.  There are only a hundred or two hundred firms in the US with the right authorization to fly commercially.  I don't see them posting a lot of job ads, because you already have to have a pilot to even qualify for the authorization.  So the most reliable way to do it would be to freelance.  Figure out how to get an FAA cert for your own little firm.  It's not easy but it's DEFINITELY not impossible.  While you're going through that process, visit the chamber of commerce, meet some realtors who are interested in roviding a birds' eye view of properties (or pick another industry and get your sales pipeline going)  One you get your FAA cert, you'll be set to make money doing it.  And you'll likely do quite well.  It's still early days.  In another few years, I anticipate it'll be a whole lot harder.  Good luck and have fun!

I've actually been 'okay' with states enacting laws, as the Fed was taking their sweet time for a couple of years.  But now, it's fairly black-&-white.  If you want to fly commercially, you need a 333 and a COA... but sometime in the next 18 months (I presume) you can take a written exam and a background check--this should allow you fly without having a private ticket. Here is the National Proposed Rule-making of what Part 107 looks like. It will be tweeked a little bit before it becomes law (they got thousands of comments to review and accept/reject), but it will be very similar to the text and verbage in the link.

Aside from the camera, what you're paying for w/ DJI is the computer system utilizing GPS along with internal barometer and compass paired with pretty damned good programming.  You might have heard of its VPS system to help stabilize indoors w/o GPS.   I tried that and crashed pretty instantly.  Luckily no real damage.  Come to think of it that was what prompted me to do the office chair training I mentioned before though....  Edit: For reference the final decent wasn't me flying.  While I was keeping an eye on things I just told it to return home and it came down smoothly on its own."
drones,39onv0,drunkadvice,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:28:06 2015 UTC,"I forget the model, but I bought a $50 quad in preparation for getting a Phantom. It was somewhat useful, but most of what I learned from the $50 quad was how to keep it stable, which you don't need to learn for the Phantom since it keeps itself stable. I think it would be perfectly reasonable to learn to fly using the phantom 5-10 feet off the ground."

drones,39oxjj,bigboffer,2,Sat Jun 13 10:02:38 2015 UTC,"Ok, so you have a parts list that will let you see video (pretty much) live.   A few helpful points:   There are lots of transmitters (e.g. boscam) that will send your gopro video out. You just need a receiver (e.g. Boscam) and something that will display whatever it gets from A/V cables to view the thing.  Check out HobbyKing's goggles as a $40 alternative to FatSharks IMPORTANT: GoPro's have a 1/4-1/2second delay.  If you fly really slowly, you may not notice it, but do keep it in mind. MOST IMPORTANT: You can't really pilot FPV with a gimbal.  You need a way to tell how much you are leaning, which is precisely what the gimbal hides from you.  It's still useful for framing shots, etc., just not for piloting.   Hope these help.  Have fun!    edit: formatting"

Until she's sure you've heard her concerns, she won't be able to accept that you can address them.  Acknowledge her concerns.  Use her language.  Acknowledge that drones may indeed be bad and provide examples of how bad pilots are doing damage to the reputation of the hobby we all love.    Only after all of that, address her concerns.  Show her how those pilots did bad things with their quadcopters and communicate how your use of your quadcopter will be different.  Be specific.   Show her the rules you will pilot by.  Show her the FAA guidelines and then the AMA guidelines and commit to following an even more strict version of the AMA guidelines.  Again, be specific.  And for the love of pete, DON'T BREAK THE RULES LATER.  Seriously.  Please.  Don't be that guy. Demonstrate your ability to control your craft.  Show that you are capable, as a pilot, of following the rules.  If you can't control your craft, you certainly won't be able to control whether it flies on to someone else's property.  Set up a little course in your back yard and fly it for her while discussing the rules that those piloting skills will allow you to maintain.  (e.g. not getting too high or close to other craft) Prove to her that you won't spy using it by incorporate a rule like ""I will not fly over other people, their property, or streets"".  If you own a GoPro, show her the video of it from property lines and how you can't see into people's homes.  If you want, drive a bike holding the GoPro pointing at the house and tell her how it's a LOT easier to control a moving bicycle than a moving quadcopter.  Tell her what you'll do with the video you're capturing (see the land from above, get the feeling of flying like a bird, etc.).  Be really specific with this.   Above all, listen, be clear and be patient.  Remember that ""drone are bad"" is something that she learned from the news and can only unlearn given time, patience and lots of clear communication from you.

It has limited camera control up/down.   The inspire1 has dual remote control with larger camera mobility.  So you can have one person focus on flying and another person focus on the camera control.

So having a drone that can fly to a destination, pick something up, and come home is my goal. The location would ideally be a about a mile or so away, and the load would be about 5 lbs.

drones,391lgr,sperry777,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:58:24 2015 UTC,"Hi, I do commercial drone work and let me preface by stating, ""delivery drone"" = expensive. You will not be allowed to do anything commercial without an FAA 333 exemption in the U.S.--if that's where you're located. Also, the FAA has no plans to issue an exemption for deliveries yet, but did (finally) grant Amazon one for test and evaluation... But no actual deliveries.  Also of note: the 333 requires a Private Pilot's certificate at a minimum and many countless hours of paperwork. In a year or so, Part 107 of the FARs will be published in the register and reduce the requirement to passing a background search ($200) and a written exam ($150).     Now on to drones & prices: our drones lift about 35lbs including aircraft--so I'm pretty stretched pulling up almost 20lbs of payload...and then only for 8-10 minutes with that kind of load. Our birds run a 6S battery configuration, and batteries alone are about 5lbs for us. Cost: aircraft built by us: ~$4k in parts, 4k in labor... If everything goes perfect. Batteries for one flight (pair of 6S 12,000mAh) cost around $500. We have to bring 10 pairs for each gig, so add another $5k. Don't get me started on insurance costs. Props for our birds range from $30-55 ea.   I hope that helps! If you're just getting in to drones and really want to see if it's for you, I highly recommend picking up a Solo from 3DR. They are awesome and are really where we can expect flight controllers to be in a year or two. Much more advanced than DJI or MicroKopter."

Because not every cell can be identical, cells will often end up at different voltages after use. If you charge an unbalanced battery pack, some cells may not get fully charged whereas other cells may get over charged. It's not necessary to balance your battery every time you charge it as the cell voltages should be small (unless the cells are especially different), but it's best to balance every 2 or 3 cycles to avoid cumulative error."

drones,38mc05,nerys71,2,Fri Jun 5 03:34:23 2015 UTC,What are you planning to do with the footage?
drones,38mc05,ahlston,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:21:07 2015 UTC,put it on youtube of course. with no ads. I also plan to send a copy to the meteor crater folks in case they want to use it (as promised) with no rights restrictions at all with explanation of how I got it without violating their ban on drones.  I just want to capture some aerial video and I want to do it legally. I don't mind ruffling feathers but I want to be moral and legal.
drones,38mc05,ahlston,2,Fri Jun 5 04:25:19 2015 UTC,"Well, I know that a non profit, 501c3, can't use the footage, legally. I would think that a government entity would be the same. This is because it would ultimately become a flight used for profit.   Airspace wise, without pulling out a sectional, 500' is the minimum that GA aircraft can fly. I'm new to UAS, but 400' is the highest that most, if not all, COAs are allowed for commercial operations. Not sure if that applies to a hobbyist"
drones,38mc05,TedW,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:44:44 2015 UTC,"no. the flight is non commercial. the footage ""after"" the fact with no PRIOR commercial consideration is usable any way they or I desire. the FAA has no jurisdiction over photography unless the flight itself is commercial. ie if the intent of the flight was to capture commercial footage then it is commercial flight. (even if no money is made)  ie assuming it is legal I will make the flight whether they get the footage or not. so the flight itself has no commercial aspect to it in any way shape or form and I have no intention of making any commercial consideration of anything I capture. (I don't like making my hobbies into work that makes it less fun)  they are separate entities.  I am a hobbyist. there is no 400ft ceiling for hobbyists only for commercial operations.  if they can't use it. that is their problem I guess sad but not my problem. I am trying to be generous. public domain is public domain after all is it not?  here is the sectional for the area.  http://vfrmap.com/?type=vfrc&lat=35.022&lon=-110.723&zoom=10  ie if I launched from the side of the road Chavez Pass Road. is that public property? or is that a private road? how do I find out? that is 1000ft from the crater and well within safe range of my bebop. I don't even really need to overfly the crater (would suck if it went down inside the crater afterall) just get close enough to get a minute of cool video."
drones,38mc05,TedW,2,Fri Jun 5 04:50:05 2015 UTC,"I am a hobbyist. there is no 400ft ceiling for hobbyists only for commercial operations.   According to the FAA guidelines, there IS a 400' ceiling for hobbyists.  You also have to be within line of sight of the craft at all times.  Can you see the beebop from 1000' away? I doubt it.  You said that you want to be moral and legal, yet you're trying to fly over someone else's property after they expressly asked you not to, while ignoring the FAA guidelines.  That doesn't sound very moral, OR very legal to me.  I don't know the legality of flying over someone else's property, but doing it when they specifically asked you not to is definitely an asshole move."
drones,38mc05,ahlston,0,Fri Jun 5 05:33:44 2015 UTC,"I have no problem seeing mine from 1500ft away been their done that. it also says I have to be WITHIN line of site not ""have"" line of site. this means you can't fly past your horizon. I bet my little wee strobe would be visible all the way to the end of LOS (about 10 miles) I have used it as far as 3 miles on aircraft and could see it just fine the entire time. I doubt I will need it for this little 1000ft flight.  they asked me not to fly FROM their property I will respect that. it is their property.  over 500ft is not their property it is a public right of way.  yes. I tend to ignore silly guidelines. laws I will obey guidelines are just that. guidelines.  I was afraid of getting this kind of appeasement backlash. I don't really blame you I guess even if it is wrong. People tend to do this when over regulation is threatened (and that is why they do it) the point is to stand your ground and say no to bad ideas fly safe but also fly free. the two are NOT incompatible. From where I would launch it would not be possible for the craft to touch another human being besides me. it lacks sufficient battery power to MAKE IT to the nearest human being.  the way I see it this will be no different than hiring a plane to overfly the crater or launching my ultralight from a nearby road. do you have a problem with that?  then why my model aircraft?  there is no 400ft ceiling."
drones,38mc05,drunkadvice,0,Fri Jun 5 14:29:18 2015 UTC,"I was afraid of getting this kind of appeasement backlash.   It sounds like you just wanted people to agree with you, but I don't.  You're intentionally breaking two of the FAA guidelines (outside unassisted line of sight, and flying above 400') and taking pictures of someone else's private property after they asked you not to.  Not sure what else you expected.  You want a medal for being an asshole?  People who rev their Harleys in residential areas at 2am aren't breaking any laws either, but that doesn't mean it's right."
drones,38mc05,drunkadvice,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:03:03 2015 UTC,"agree? don't really care either way. Stay Legal. that I care about.  whether people agree with me does not really effect me one little bit (I have thick skin)  break a law however and people with real sticks come to use them.  they are guidelines. I dismiss those guidelines. they have no weight in law as per congress as is proper.  hell half my hobby becomes ""impossible"" with a 400ft cap. my rocket gliders BOOST to 800ft on ""small"" engines.  yes. they are. it is called disturbing the peace.  I fly my drone weekly. I never stay below 400ft. I don't consider it ""flight safety"" until I have exceeded 300-400ft. too much ground clutter to be safe unless your whipping around a park flyer or something.  I have zero doubt I can see my craft to 2000ft. probably 3000ft. unassisted. no camera no binocs.  I have never gone that far not because I don't trust my vision but only because I don't trust the equipment.  my rocket gliders. I was flying ""speck vision"" (meaning you only saw a speck) at 2200ft no assistance. I could see it but not perceive orientation until it ""moved"" enough across the sky for me to see which way it was going. hovering in a breeze (very good glider) was a bitch at that altitude when you wanted to move :-)  how much RC experience do you have? it sounds like your only experience is quads. the hobby is quite a bit bigger than that."
drones,38mc05,gojukebox,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:02:00 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't have an exact answer for you. After doing some reading, it looks like it be on privately owned land, the crater, anyways. That said, I don't think there is an black letter law to prevent you from enjoying your hobby. I don't know the area well enough around there to say where you could launch from. Sorry, I've been no help at all."
drones,38mc05,aiurlives,1 point,Fri Jun 5 05:22:02 2015 UTC,I don't mind ruffling feathers but I want to be moral and legal.   You asked for permission and they said No.  What kind of morals do you have that you would allow you to disrespect them that way?
drones,38mc05,luke_ubiquitous,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:22:57 2015 UTC,I asked for permission to fly FROM THEIR FACILITY. I do not need permission from them to take a picture of my planet.  morally I will not fly from their facility since they told me no.  your moral compass is skewed by your paranoia over over regulation of this hobby. please balance it. no offense intended.
drones,38mc05,luke_ubiquitous,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:57:39 2015 UTC,You said over the crater. You did not say from their facility. So what's it matter if we're arguing over semantics.  Do what you want.
drones,38mc05,luke_ubiquitous,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:16:54 2015 UTC,"hmm I could see that being confusing.   the logical assumption is FROM their facility. that would be part of the point. to capture video of the ground (from the side not overhead of course) the viewing area's the buildings museum etc.. would be more interesting video.  Legally I am allowed to fly over the crater as long as I do not launch from their property. as I said earlier I don't want to be IN the crater (above or below the rim) zero chance of recovery if it goes down in the crater. Plus I can get better pictures of that kind from the ground with my normal camera.  photographically there is no point. I can not attain enough altitude to see the entire crater from above insufficient onboard power and distrust in the equipment at that range. I will probably need to be pretty well off to the side to get the whole thing in the shot.  I doubt I will even have to intrude over their property to do it though that is not relevant to the legal issue. they don't own the air over the crater. Just like I don't own the air over my house.  the REASON for flying at 500ft is that I do not know where the demarcation is between public land and THEIR land. so to be 100% legal I need to be in public airspace. apparently there is no altitude limit in this area for aircraft. so as long as I launch from public space I can be 50ft off the ground if I wish. I do not wish to be that low since to me that violates the ""spirit"" of asking permission and being denied. flying at 50ft is ""defactor"" flying from their property in my book even though legally it is sound (this is what I mean by legally and morally) flying from clearly public airspace REMOVES the moral quagmire.  national parks are different. technically they also do not own the air above either but I sure as hell and not going to challenge that :-) I don't have a big enough stick and they definitely do. PLUS you can't reach anything interesting from outside the boundaries or a national park with a 1 mile range and I will sure as hell never ""test"" that 1 mile range limit. I barely trust it at a third of a mile.  I will not bring my drone onto their property to fly it from their property because they have told me no. I will honor that. Even if I were to fly the drone from their property I would be breaking no laws in that regard. I would simply be ""trespassing"" as I would be violating their rules and automatically be ""not welcome"" ie trespassing.  Just as I would expect someone to honor my request to not launch from my yard.  that has nothing to do with launching from their yard or from public property and overflying my home. I don't mind that and it is legal.  being legal and moral does not mean ""do as you say"" (anyone)  being legal and moral means get what I want without being dishonorable or breaking the letter or spirit of the law.  this is why I used the ultralight example. if that is morally and legally clear then so is the quad copter/drone.  if it would NOT be legal to fly my ultralight over the their property then it would also likewise probably not be legal to fly my quad over their property."
drones,38mc05,luke_ubiquitous,2,Sat Jun 6 01:31:17 2015 UTC,"It is not legal to take an aircraft above 400 ft under FAA guidelines*.  Also, just because you launch from off of their property, once you cross the perimeter you are still ""on"" their property, unless you're 400' up in which case you're now in restricted air space.  This just doesn't sound like a good plan, and a bebop surely isn't the best tool for a distance flight."
drones,38mc05,tallguy14,2,Fri Jun 5 07:22:30 2015 UTC,"I don't believe the airspace is technically their property.  That being said, the chances of crashing the drone on their property are a bit high to justify this.  If he got in and out without crashing, there'd be no problem.  If he loses his drone and it crashes on their property, he could be in some legal trouble.  At the very least he'd have to abandon the drone.  You also really need to buy a sectional chart for this area and look at it to determine what kind of airspace this is.  Arizona has tons of military airspace areas in which any kind of flight could be illegal.  If you don't know how to read a sectional, you're not ready to start doing this kind of work."
drones,38mc05,tallguy14,0,Fri Jun 5 14:08:32 2015 UTC,it is not illegal to take an aircraft above 400ft.  the FAA has no legal authority to promulgate rules over hobby aviation except for immediate safety such as flying over an airport etc..  every RC plane out their of any size flies over 400ft as a matter of course. every rocket rc plane boosts to minimum 800ft typically 1200 ft.  do you guys really have an issue not understanding the difference between LAW and GUIDELINES ?
drones,38mc05,tallguy14,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:22:23 2015 UTC,"Late to the party... But no, you can not take an RC hobby aircraft over 400'. The FAA decided that in the 1980s. http://www.faa.gov/documentlibrary/media/advisory_circular/91-57.pdf"

drones,383bfa,Slagard,2,Mon Jun 1 19:21:29 2015 UTC,"So, I would say then that your best bet would be to buy an old DJI Phantom. They have come way down in price - $400 or so. http://www.amazon.com/DJI-Phantom-Aerial-Drone-Quadcopter/dp/B00AGOSQI8  Another option is to, of course, build your own for about $300, but that is intimidating at first.   Finally, the parrot AR drone is another cheap option <$300, but the extra $100 is very much worth it. I would also recommend seeking out a drone club or flying club in your area or university. I know that most universities with engineering departments have a number of enthusiasts who pool money together to get a better UAS that they couldn't otherwise afford, or they have funding through clubs for it.   I'd also recommend looking into where and how to fly."

Grabbing a multirotor out of the air is foolish. Not to mention flying above a crowd.  Looks like a DJI Inspire. I wonder if the pilot was expecting that."
drones,3827ti,cyberhiker,2,Mon Jun 1 10:54:56 2015 UTC,I really doubt the pilot was expecting it. I think what happened is the landing gear lowered once the dude stepped underneath it. Because the landing gear automatically lowers when the downward facing camera sees something. With the gear lowered it brought the props closer to his hand than he was expecting.
drones,3827ti,DroneFrontier,3,Mon Jun 1 16:49:25 2015 UTC,"No, it also stated in other articles that the singer frequently grabbed the drones out of the air to turn them around and offer a PoV to the crowd.

drones,37u8yn,JohnFMoore,1 point,Sat May 30 13:04:24 2015 UTC,"I can't sign this petition because I do not agree with many things IN IT. I do not agree with ANY government rules regarding drones. Congress was correct and proper in decreeing that the FAA MAY NOT govern hobby recreational model aircraft except for safety. you want to fly under rules? do as the law stipulates. join a legitimate organization such as the AMA and fly by their rules.  I do not agree with not flying within 5 miles of airports. this is both not unsafe and not illegal in most situations.  me flying my drone at rooftop level is both legal and a non issue to any airport even one ""next door"" over roof top you are not in aviation airspace and you need to notify the local airport simply so they are aware and can guide you as to where not to fly (traffic patterns landing take off approach departure avenues etc.. usually not an issue unless you are flying high (over 100feet)  I do not and will never agree or comply with a 400ft ceiling. I don't consider myself even truly AIRBORNE until I exceed 400ft. The only reason I fly at 500ft cap is because the damned thing won't go higher than that.  The moment I figure out how to bypass that or build my own vehicle it will no longer have that limitation.  I can fly my RC plane to 1500ft no problem I can fly my controlled rockets to 5000ft or 10,000ft no problem I see ZERO ISSUES in any way shape or form with me flying my drone WELL over 400ft and it is NOT dangerous.  that is like saying a ""gun"" is dangerous which anyone who has any intelligence knows is poppycock.  ""Do not fly near other people, stadiums, power stations, or any other public infrastructure.""  Disagree unless it is sensitive locations. I might have to fly over the meteor crater this summer from outside the limits of their property and I MUST be over 400ft to be in ""national airspace"" and not be in violation of their local ""ban"" on drone flying.  ie to be legal I have to fly to 500ft AGL and then enter the airspace over their land (they can not control airspace that high it is public airspace) which is why I would need to fly that high.  ""When flying in residential areas, or anytime you are flying near houses, seek permission of those around and ensure they understand how you are using the drone. No one wants their privacy invaded.""  no the airspace is public access for me to use. I do not wish to have nor want to invite your permission or discussion.  if you come to me I will gladly educate and teach you about the hobby and invite you to join me.  THERE IS NO PRIVACY CONCERNS. have you never ""SEEN"" a video from onboard one of these things?  if you see a drone flying ""outside your bedroom window"" PLEASE by all means take a bat or shotgun to it.  if it is flying OVER your house. Ignore it. not only is it legitimately none of your business it is NO danger to you or your privacy.  from even 100ft up you typically can not even tell the difference between male and female from the ultra wide angle video these drones use.  the drones that invade your privacy YOU WILL NEVER SEE. it will be a police, government, or military drone a mile away with a giant telephoto lens. you will never see it. ever. and that is the point.  NO consumer drone is a threat to privacy in any way shape or form unless flown BELOW THE ROOF LINE.  as for flying near people.  this depends. #1 are the people aware and willing. this is key. if they are not aware or willing you should not be flying over them. PERIOD. this applies to ANY model. rocket airplane helicopter or drone.  if the people are aware and willing there is no problem flying over them if done with reasonable safety.  you have no problem standing around at a little league ball came where a loose bat or whacked ball can KILL YOU INSTANTLY (and it has happened)  why worry about a drone that is highly unlikely to even hurt you not to speak of kill you.  I have a 400gram drone that won't even HURT YOU if you shove your fingers in the props. I have no problem morally or any other way flying this near people from a reasonable altitude.  lower and over top of them if they are aware and willing.  40 pound octacopter with an SLR onboard? totally different ball game.  yet you don't go crying and running when a new chopper flies overheard?  use your brains. use reason. stop getting panicked and crazy over things that are a non issue.  don't worry about dumb people doing silly things THAT WILL SETTLE OVER TIME as people realizes. yeah maybe that was not the greatest idea.  but we also need NEGOTIATION from the other side.  I am going to one private and 3 national parks this morning. I have requested permission to fly my 400g harmless drone and have been rebuffed flat out.  and you wonder why people get pissed?  I WANT TO FILM THESE PLACES FROM THE AIR. These are my parks. I am a citizen of this nation a tax payer of this nation. WHY can I not do this if I can do so without harming or bothering ANYONE ELSE at that park ?  WHY is there no process in place to APPROVE a reasonable safe request with a harmless model.

drones,37lj8w,photodad,1 point,Thu May 28 15:01:14 2015 UTC,"The timing of this is odd.  GoPro just partnered with 3D Robotics to create the Solo, which is a GoPro drone, in a very real sense of both the words and the phrase.  It's a drone (and I do mean drone, as opposed to UAV, due to it's automation features) that's been specifically designed to work hand-in-hand with GoPro cameras; not only to get them into the air, but also to control them completely, and it's the only drone that's capable of doing so.  Given that the Solo is about to start shipping, the timing of GoPro's announcement seems very weird.  Either 3DR is going to be their partnering drone manufacturer, or GoPro just slapped 3DR in the face pretty hard by partnering with them so closely and then dumping them.

A map of the field has already been made and programmed into the drone's software... drone knows to go fly a preprogrammed path along that map, counting the head (ie, pinging the tags and filling in a database).  lets say 15 of them are all in one area but 5 are separated from the herd.    ...the drone would not only 'know' which 15 are there / which 5 aren't... and would then fly the preprogrammed path for that field to 'find' the other 5...   once all 20 are found, fly back w/out wasting more time/energy on it.   if 19 are found but there's a 20th gone astray... fly the path until it finds it.  after x-minutes not finding it... send a notification ...  or if it's lost, out of the area, etc, send notification that it's not in the area and... well, smartphone alert making the 'shepherd' aware that one of their flock has gone missing.    a lot of this ties into other sensor grids that could be set up on a farm... and, lots of other technologies beyond just drones but... the drone could play a critical part in enhancing this   to act as a temporary wifi repeater ....  so, if i have a grid set out on a farm but it's too far away from the barn or what not to download data... .. to be able to fly out and connect to it, but not just download data (or upload it) ... but also to tie that part of the grid to the drone... then the drone, in turn, to bridge to the barn or what not...   ...though, this is largely silly, but it'd still be nice software to have in the drone ... given that the drone may be network-connected-capable so why not include something similar.  but, the idea is the drone could go to an area, hover for x-minutes until the data is downloaded, know that the data is downloaded, then move on.     obviously this is also redundant with just going out and downloading the data itself and bringing it back.  but, definitely longer flight time and more-capable energy source.  that 4hr fuel cell drone posted the other day would definitely be necessary   irrigation monitoring  lets say there's drip irrigation installed... the ability to fly down a line and 'see' whether or not the drips are dripping... sprays are spraying, etc.   be able to detect the moisture of the lines in such as to know it isn't just moisture on leaves but actual spray coming out... ie, to let know if there's a clogged or broken line.   those are the ones that pop up in my head.  edit: felt compelled"

From that data you can know (assuming you have the right instruments on board) for crop health, growth, interference (pests), and harvesting readiness.  Drones are already available with different fuel sources - they are called RC Aircraft - use Drone autopilots instead of RC controls and book, you have a gas powered drone.  I flew one that traveled 400MPH! (was a fixed delta-wing RC Bomber - could drop pretend bombs too!)  Auto take of an landing is coming - we have this for cell phones, drones just need a bigger charging pad. Patents have already been filed on this.  Grid accuracy - look at the Aero-M, they already are.  Sensor tie in, not offered by DJI, but already available. Look at these videos from Cirque du Soleil showing millimeter precision indoors.  Flying between rows is not what aerial drones do well - you need an UGS to move more slowly and being able to see things from ground level - tons of great platforms coming soon.  Anthything you can sense can be done by a drone and the data recorded or streamed.  Air temp, humidity, Solar IR, spectral, etc.  Ground drones could go down the rows and sample ground moisture, and collect samples to bring back (after all a drone on Mars does that we just need to make them cheaper).

I saw your other post after I refreshed the page.   check out the edits I did to the above post if in case I did them after you saw the 'first draft'  your post had some things in it I hadn't thought about, namely the microfertilization.  personally I see this as being way off, but maybe/hopefully I'm wrong.    I mean, I suppose much of it comes down to power source ... thus, how much weight a drone can carry, how complex they can become, etc ... ...i mean, I suppose you could have a 'big drone' flying overhead feeding supplies to a smaller drone connected via a tether & tubing system that can spray xyz directly onto a needed plant...  to take your pest thing farther... with ultrasonic, radar, and other 'imaging' approaches, I'd imagine even insect identification could go on ...and, subsequent & directed spraying.   so, caterpillars on your leaves? beetles going crazy?  spray 'em!    ???   but, I see much of that as being really far out .. if ever  I totally agree with you on the first steps basically being an imaging thing ... ...a carry over from the enthusiastic photographer-drone op.    I mean, with the right regs in place, there's really no reason drones couldn't be 'suv-sized' .... on down to these smaller pocket-sized drones....    i've always been curious about a 'drone tether' ...  like, high gauge speaker wire running between a larger drone to a smaller one powering it...   or just powering drones with cables to begin with.... I mean, a microUSB 3.0 cable is pretty small, and some are much lighter than others, and those things can pump out 100w .... ....if the cable is being supported by a hydrocarbon-fueled 'mother drone' and smaller ones are simply drawing the power from them (ie, hovering below them vs above them) ... then 'swarms' of drones could work together (tethered or not) to cover a few different angles of it.  um...  but yeah, i'm of the opinion that it's definitely going to take an denser fuel source, and nothing's as dense as hydrocarbons... except nuclear. ... so a drone with an onboard generator powering smaller one could make sense?   I mean, right now I think a lot of the view is on 'standard' drone sizes... but, with the right regs in place, why not have a 'car-sized' drone hovering supplies overhead.   I think the idea of dumping water from above is obviously just ridiculous... but, 'swarming' software tying a few different drones together? with a 2-3 hour energy source? how is that completely unrealistic?   Auto take of an landing is coming   I think this will be a big part... and, I'll take it farther.    I mean, my roomba can automatically take itself back to its charging station, why can't a drone use similar software and automatically land in an area that automatically connects it to a charge or refill station?    more than that, the ability to automatically pick up different fuel tanks or spray tanks....   I know on the one hand this sounds absolutely absurd but... if it can go back to a certain point automatically then land... ...and do so on a V-shaped thing that naturally 'drops' it into place in such that a 'nozzle' or something injects fuel into it (think air compressor hose or something... with the fuel being n.gas or something 'like' that) ... ....why not have another similar with a tank of fertilizer or pesticide?    on the one hand, this sounds absurdly expensive and totally niche.  on another though... vineyards are huge and can make a lot of money.  the ability to automate a spraying of a 5'000 acre vineyard???    you say 400mph, but even 25mph or 40mph to get from a field back to a barn back out to the field again ... and while the farmer stays out in the field tending to other things until it gets back?       which brings in simple 'delivery drones Amazon-style'     have a barn with some guys in it, out in the field fixing something. run out of a $2 box of staples fixing a line and have to load your shit up in the truck, drive 10 minutes back to the barn, get it, only to drive back ... vs send the drone to the barn, guy in barn gets called/radioed in to throw in the box... and the drone flies back.   the time/energy saved in something like that is huge    .... something like that could eat up 20-30 minutes easy... vs take '5 minutes' for a drone... while the guy in the field is still doing his deal.  and the only thing that'd require is a drone that can carry an x-lb payload and fly a predetermined path... and back again.   throw that on a guy making $35/hr and do that just 1x a week.... let alone a few times a day?  and for a few guys out in a field making that or similar?    savings add up pretty quickly.    ...and, again, nothing more complex than an 'Amazon delivery drone' to do something like that.   Flying between rows is not what aerial drones do well    not yet ... but, with the sensors you mention above?  I think they could.    why? is another question... but, between grape rows, just check out the vine rangers vid... between corn rows... obviously there isn't a huge cost advantage to this... but, take something like the DJ's prop guards... make them a tad more complex whereby the entire blade is surrounded.. then covered top & bottom with a light weight screen... ...i'm not sure how this would mess with aerodynamics but... ..in such that the unit is protected... then fly it along?   ...reinforced by sensors, of course for flight path and such....  then there's the 'drone' element that isn't flight-based drones.  I think there's just as much potential for ground drones to do just as much...and the two working in unison feeding information back & forth... drone on the ground... potentially with much greater power supply... tethered to a drone flying directly above it?  .... going down a row or a line?  monitoring soil and aerial data at the same time?   obviously these could be done wirelessly... as well done at separate times and the data stitched back together, but for accuracy's sake, the ability to do both at the same time seems like it could drastically cut down on the cost of sensors spread throughout.   and, again, the energy-capability if it's, say, a vineyard where the rows are far enough apart that a power-tether wouldn't get hung up on leaves and such.  I know the focus is on aerial drones but.... that limits things a lot.  I'll check out the links."

John Deer makes a ground drone as a lawn mower, runs just like a roomba.   ...but, if this is an example of 'state of the art' ... I'm up on it :P  I really think that ground-based drones are under-developed & underfunded   I mean, look at what's happening with aerial drones.   look at what's happening with self-driving cars.  let me reword that for emphasis:  look at what's happening with one of the number 1 methods of death on the planet.   we're not just talking about, but are actually putting people into computer-controlled cars and speeding them along on pothole riddled streets with 'countless' barely-predictable variables  ....   .....we have walking robotic 'dogs' ... ....we have self-steering tractors...  ....but we don't have a 5mph robo-drone deal that has 5 gallons of diesel fueling a generator that, in turn, powers electricity to a track-drone that goes down rows of crops taking soil samples, testing moisture content, spraying rows, mapping topography, laying irrigation lines, placing sensors, or countless other menial tasks?  I'm not 'attacking' aerial drones so much as implying that doing something in the air seems even harder to do than doing something on the ground ... ...and, tying the two together??   scarecrow   this will be hilarious to see!  I've watched more than one territorial bird attack a quadcopter before.     draw insects away   I tied a flashlight to my drone and flew it over my backyard as a sort of 'overhead light source' while I was wrapping up stuff one night ... bugs started flying around it like crazy!   Drones can carry quite a bit of weight. Here is a video of a quadcopter lifting a 5 gallon bottle of water (22kg).   no link.  but, unless you're feeling motivated, don't worry about it .... ...and, yeah, I have no doubt they can carry it.. ...it's more a matter of 'for how long?'   ....  I still think there's something to this 'tethering' deal... ground-based power source (track drone rolling around with a 5kw diesel generator with 5+ gallon fuel tank....  connected to a tether connected to a drone overhead providing it 'near-endless' energy)   Ground drones have an advantage over aerial - they can be solar charges and sit out in the field waiting for a task based upon what the farmer directs from info that came from an aerial.   or they can be petro-fueled, or n.gas ... and be programmed to auto-drive into the barn if they get below x-gallons/cfu's of fuel.    it's less the possibility for these and more just creating them with enough tasks to justify a probably-hefty price tag.  ...esp initially.   separate drones for different tasks   as well, separate attachments for the same drone... ...for different tasks.   I'm totally optimistic about this... ...and, I think the tech is more than there already .. ...it's just a matter of getting it put together, getting it put in place, and making it available.. ...in a realistic price range... for the customer.  I think the first target markets can/should/will be the 'hobby farmer' .. the millionaire doctor who owns 500 acres surrounding their 'pre-retirement farmhouse'  ... I know more than a few doctors with x-hundred acres and a gorgeous house on the outskirts ... with condos in the city.  .... and equipment that cost way more and that does way more than they could ever need it to do.. ...who would love to brag to their friends about their robodrone.. ....  if sitting in their 8th floor office downtown and being able to 'log into' their ground (or aerial) drone and drive (or fly) it around via their computer ... while making their next patient wait in the office to find out they're cancer-free ... or going to die in a few months if they don't have this $50k chemo treatment... .... well, I think they'd eat that shit up!  make it ipad controllable over the internet?  or iphone controllable?  and they can show their doctor buddies or medtech slaves the 5 acres of vineyard they (had) put up over the weekend to help them win 2018th's red ribbon in the annual wine tasting competition?  yeah... trust me, they'll eat. that. shit. up!   I went to the wine deal here last year (my buddy's a ribbon winner every year) ... a few of the vineyard booths advertising their grapes had tablets set out on the table playing videos they'd had made to show off their farm/vineyard ... included drone footage of the whole farm.   talk about a subculture that likes to brag!  ...and is tech-competitive as fuck!  you get the idea.. i'm well beyond the point of babbling at this point  edit:  ground-based mixed with aerial"

It took 20 years to evolve the internet (1984)  It took 6 years to invent and 10 to evolve the smartphone (2000 & 2004)  It took 6 years to evolve the drones we know now and just 3 years to build the market  So the rest will follow fast too
drones,37cqnq,jared_number_two,2,Thu May 28 15:08:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the 'law of accelerated returns' is definitely beginning to apply itself to drones....  ....but, so much of what would be awesome if developed.. ...so much of what I've rambled about (for instance), is dependent on so many variables outside of just the drones.  the drones are just one of the pieces tying other elements together.  but, that also means that parallelism can happen in the development... with advances happening on multiple fronts at once.  but, I still think it will take years-to-decades (if ever) before it's all really put together .. if ever.  but, even as most of it currently sits, I can see no real technological limitation to any of it ... even now.  sure there will be advances that will make it all the more 'effective', cheaper, widely deployable, ...widely utilizable... ...but, as it currently sits, it's more just a matter of 'putting it all together'.. ...then advancing it generation after generation.   I definitely don't see any single company rising to the tops... and, in fact, see a major benefit happening from multiple, independent ideas, lines of development, both working together and competing against one another... in such that a building off of one another takes place.    kinda-sorta like the development of Linux.  ...let's just hope that like Linux, most of the advancements don't get too tied down in patent b.s.     ...that could really stifle it.  but, I also think that '$75m' is just the first of many times that to come down the line.   ... in such that, I wouldn't be surprised (though, not really sure I'd want to place a bet on it) that AgDrones won't be a $1billion+ (a year) industry by 2025-2030.   ... or, at least drones in general.  but, can't put it all just on aerial drones.  it's a lot easier to roll something across the ground than get it aloft and move it through the air ...   but, also, energy...  h.c.-electric hybrids are going to be where it's at in my personal opinion ... and, for the most part, that means larger drones.   ... despite advancements in shrinking combustion engines down to size.   ... fuel cells could come into play too... ...but, if those haven't come out for cars yet, ... and that's already a clearly established industry .. ..then the likelihood that they'll move forward on drones first is.... ....less-than-likely.  though, maybe drones could be where that type of development does get deployed earlier... then start rolling up & out to cars??  I know I'd much rather fill up a tank with some compressed n.gas or, simply, diesel or gasoline than sit around waiting for countless batteries to charge up.    but, the industry will definitely benefit from it even if it tech froze today and just-what's-out-there-now became more widely utilized. so...exciting times! :)"

Microsoft ICE can do the image mosaicking, but I don't think you can get the point cloud out of it (I could be wrong on that though)  Bundler along with CMVS is another toolset that you can use and I believe they are open source.

But, digging through some of your more recent comments, you appear to be far more interesting than that. You say you were an engineer on the old Atari computers? And you have something to do with TigerDirect? It sounds like you're entering the DIY drone market in some fashion? That all sounds great. Except this is where context comes into play. Your post title is in the form of a vaguely rudely formulated question. You might want to think, in the future, of phrasing the question differently. Something like this.  ""I'm a former Atari engineer who has started a DIY drone mail order site. I want to know what you want in a drone.""  (or something like that...)  But it seems your heart is in the right place.  I have a friend who has been through, at last count, 3 DJI Phantoms. Some of them have just flown off into the sunny Pacific, never to be seen again, after receiving software updates. Needless to say, he's discovered how large and impersonal a company they have become because of this.  Personally, what I like about DIY drones, is being able to swap out parts and customize it as I see fit. In so much that it is a fairly standard and modular system, I can source parts from multiple sources and find the prices and parts that work for me.  Aside from that, I am not really sure what you mean by ""real people"". You mean regular consumers? I'm not sure an angry droid like myself would know. Most non-engineer people I know are simply terrified by drones, to be honest. Even if they don't think people are using them to peep in their bedroom window they are just wary of any object with the characteristics of a flying power tool being anywhere near them. Not sure I really blame them.  Anyways, there's some answer-type stuff for you. But welcome to reddit! You know there's probably a few hundred people that will freak out if you were to do an AMA on one of the Atari-themed subreddits."
drones,372y54,angrydroid,1 point,Mon May 25 13:38:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback, very much appreciate it.  Yes we are interested in DIY, but soon the market will move mostly past that point.  Same as in the pC industry. There will always be the people who tweak and customize, and even build their own, but the vast majority are interested in something read to use.  You are right there is a lot of hype and fear. In the early days of the auto industry, and the PC industry it was the same. People lose their fear when they have an application - that becomes their motivator.  ""AMA""??  Yes happy to share the ""good"" ole days at Atari - things like the real reason ET was burried in New Mexico."
drones,372y54,angrydroid,1 point,Mon May 25 19:24:49 2015 UTC,"Are you sure that drones are really something that is going to become an everyday appliance? Do you think that's even a good idea? I see them as more of a novelty.  As for the Atari stuff, I watched that documentary on Netflix recently. I suggest you check out some of the atari subreddits like /r/Atari & r/Atari2600 ...that is, if you are so inclined. Or maybe /r/retrogaming. Might be a good way to build up some karma for you. An AMA is an Ask Me Anything thread. There's a whole /r/AMA subreddit. But, assuming you are in fact who you purport to be, you basically are like a rock star around here if you want to be."
drones,372y54,angrydroid,2,Tue May 26 01:36:32 2015 UTC,"Ok, to your points ...  Drones a novelty - same was said about personal computers, mostly by Main Frame lab coat guys (though I have nothing against Lab Coats - still have mine!) I was actually trained by Control Data back in the day when 8 BYTES (8 letters) were stored on a 5 inch by 5 inch board of woven wires and magnetic cores - still have one in my collection too!  Drones are as foundational a tech as smartphones and the internet - they extend the internet out into the physical world in ways that smartphones and tablets cannot. Plus they do useful work - they are robots. The only limitation is what you can think of for them to do. They are neither good nor back, they just are.  As far as Atari, I am not really interested in being a rock star, though am happy to tell the tales. We changed the world, no small thing. Was a joint effort. Even things that I did (first shopping cart 1982 - first online advertising 1983 - etc.), I still had help from my staff and they deserve credit too.  I have worked for too many meglomaniacs (kind term for business sociopaths) to claim I did everything alone, but I and we did a lot. Anyone that wants their AMA dose can get it here. Drones are more fun anyway, especially the upcoming Formula One Drone Racing™ coming next year!!!"

drones,36wi7t,StarAvenger,3,Fri May 22 18:22:10 2015 UTC,"While the kid is no stranger to controversy, recently, Japan was looking at ways to curb on drone usage. His arrest was due to ""disturbing religious ceremony business"".   In another video by this kid, he has a drone without propellers, and passer bys call police which does not let him leave and end up bringing him to police precinct for questioning."
drones,36wi7t,Coastreddit,1 point,Fri May 22 18:26:37 2015 UTC,Can you understand what they were saying or did you read about this somewhere?    That was definitely the wrong time and place to be flying but arrest seems a bit steep.   I guess because he was a repeat offender they felt the need to teach him a lesson.   Also how is having a quadcopter with no props a crime?
drones,36wi7t,Coastreddit,2,Sat May 23 00:17:09 2015 UTC,"Actually, yes, I can understand what they are saying, and at the same time I am in awe with Japanese police and feel very angry about this.  First, it seems as some salaryman is bugging the guy asking him what it is, and despite young boy's replies that this is a drone but without the propellers, so it cannot fly, salaryman continues to harrass him. When told that there is nothing illegal about having a drone and he is not flying it, the man insists that drones are not good, and even though there is no law against him being there, he (the boy) is committing some sort of crime because he brought the drone.  Boy is asking to be left alone, but the guy is stalking him until police arrive.  Police strts to pester him with questions, to which the young drone pilot with much better composure than many of us, truthfully answers that this is a drone, that it has no propellers, and no, he was not flying it. He asks to be left alone, so he can leave. Police insist that he goes to police station, so they can ask him more questions.  Japanese law gives police more powers and ability to detain people once you are inside a police station. On a street, they cannot really detain you easily. Boy seems to know this, so he says that he does not want to go to police station because he has done nothing wrong, and he wants to leave. Police keeps ignoring him, and slowly starts to bait him.   At the end, they forcefully carry him to the car under the pretense that he is blocking pedestrian traffic...Even though, from very beginning, the boy is sayng he wants to go home, and that having 20 policemen around him, is causing a commotion.   In essence, police purposefully started to congregate around him, and not allow him to leave to create a situation which would allow them to claim that he is blocking the traffic and thus drag him to the police station.  While it is obvious what he was planning on doing there, the way it was handled is digusting. While it maybe much much better than in many other countries, for Japan, seeing Japanese police bait someone who has not done anything illegal into being arrested and spend 4 hours at a police precinct is disturbing.   I hold Japanese polie in very high regard, and seeing this sort of behavior is simply disgusting."

I have 3 of their drones and have been extremely happy with them. I am about to buy this one as well. Your looking at about 4k usd for the inspire.   The problem I have always had is flight time. The Inspire is suppose to use a smart battery which will land itself if low on power.   I hope this helps.

Here is a link on some options out there: http://dronelife.com/2014/10/01/best-agricultural-drones-available-today/  I am actually curious to get your opinion on what you think is more likely, farmers will buy their own Agdrones if prices drop or would they  be willing to pay someone to provide the service for them instead several times a year?"
drones,35t8yr,hey_kool_aid,1 point,Thu May 14 00:44:30 2015 UTC,"Well , it finally boils down to numbers. Research says using drones and NDVI processing for precision agriculture leads to 60% saving of water and up to 40% saving in fertilsers and insecticides , it also helps in early stress detection and thus improving yield. If farmers are likely to get gains equal to their investment withing 2-3 years which is what is being thrown around, then they should be willing to buy the entire system given they have a large enough farm high produce."

But if a significant enough segment of the English speaking population began to do so and if that definition became mainstream, then that is all it takes for the definition to change. I mean, do you seriously think words and their corresponding definitions in the English language remain static?   Within more knowledgeable communities the word ""drone"" may remain distinct from ""quadrocopters"" or whatever. But for most people, the distinction is unnecessary. When they say ""drone,"" they often mean ""quadrocopter"" and virtually everyone understands them. So it becomes synonymous. The definition has expanded.  I mean, does it upset or confuse you that this subreddit is called ""drones"" yet a huge number of the posts feature RC quadrocopters? Any confusion is negligible. The broader definition works. But if you post a picture of a strawberry cake and call it a drone, people will be confused. That definition doesn't work. Maybe it will someday, but that seems unlikely.  Language is fluid.

In hindsight, a smaller quad might have actually saved me some money because of how many props you can break while learning how to fly.  Out of my initial $300, I spent ~50 on props and went back for more by the end of the month.  I probably could have spent that $50 on a micro quad and learned the same lessons.  I can also tell you that a lot of the locals I've met have been putting their 450 quads on the shelf and building smaller 250 size quads for racing.  The bigger quads have more bells and whistles but that means bigger price tags, and they are reluctant to fly them on the exciting routes the smaller, cheaper, 250 quads can make.  I suggest trying to meet some locals first.  You can get some tips on building, maybe even buy a used quad for cheaper, and have fun talking shop.

Gearbest has them for $45, and for 50 cents more you can get one with a camera (0.3mp, kinda crappy, but still fun for spying on the neighbors). I can also tell you that my Hubsan is a great little basher, and has survived high speed crashes, running into furniture and, on one memorable occasion, getting its props stuck in the dog's fur.  On the other hand, Realflight lets you simulate a whole bunch of different aircraft and, probably, conditions (my experience is limited to playing with it for a few minutes at the hobby shop).

drones,345h8x,superfuckinggay,3,Tue Apr 28 13:35:46 2015 UTC,"Due to altitude restrictions in most places. 400-500ft is the highest you can go without special clearance.   As to long distances, you can build quadcopters with near 30 minute flight times, or fixed wings with 60+ minute flight times within reasonable budgets.  Actual ranges then become a limitation of control signal range, telemetry signal range, video signal range and payload weight (cameras,  camera stabilization gimbal, camera lenses).   For sharable or production quality photos or video, you'll be leaning towards a multirotor as they can carry more gear and hover in place to get the shot. - For mapping, survey,  or other large scale sensor sweeping activities fixed wings can cover more ground, then use software back on the ground to stitch the ohotos together or crunch the data.   Checkout /r/multirotor /r/fpv and the rcgroups forums for more general info.  /r/multirotorbuilds is a new sub that can help get your actual part list squared away for DIY multirotor projects.  Before hitting the above sources with more questions.  Narrow dow your needs a bit more.    Range from ground station. Both typical range and max. - Important to know what radio tech to use Total distance traveled per mission.  To figute out battery time. Can you swap batteries mid mission? Or need to stay in the air the entire time? What kind of payload? GoPro camera? DSLR camera? Mapping camera? IR camera? how much of the flight will be gps automated vs manual control?  how big can it be physically? Does it need to fit in a compact car, SUV, or in a hiking backpack to get to the launch location?  how much rc experience do you have? Any existing rc gear? your location and the country you want to operate in? if usa do you already have a HAM radio license?"

I'm looking for maximal flight distance and payload, everything else is secondary. I don't think /r/multirotor would help because this sounds more like a fixed wing build. I have some fpv experience, but really I feel my engineering experience would be more valuable.  To give some better insight, I'm hoping to make a proof of concept for a inter-city delivery drone. As in, drone flies from A to B and air drops goods at B, then returns to A.   To answer some of your questions:  Range of about 50 miles max. Typical, 20. Distance would be the same.   No swapping batteries.  10-20 lb payload, camera is not necessary.   Looking at mostly GPS automated, besides perhaps takeoff and landing.  Big as legally allowed.   US, no HAM license. Seems to me a big hurdle would be getting the legal clearance to launch a big unmanned vehicle in the air.   Appreciate any help."

Air drop I can see many regulatory hurdles unless this is a relief drop dropping specialized medical supplies in 3rd world countries. Is the drop off point the same every time? I.e. will you own the rooftop or ground on both A and B locations? If so a fixed wing might be able to come in close precision drop the delivery into a net/chute/airbag and keep flying.    Range of about 50 miles max. Typical, 20. Distance would be the same.    Wow that ... wow ... I've been impressed with my own 1.5 mile flights. That's just. It would need to be automated, however the FAA has issues with that now, especially for commercial use. They are finally lightening the leash on amazon for tightly controlled testing of their delivery drone. Technical hurdles, not insurmountable, but still hurdles. I see are staying connected to a ground/monitoring station needing some tinkering beyond off the shelf parts. Integrating MAVlink telemetry control protocol over something like the cellular network, or relaying it over the internet to a couple points along the flight path.    10-20 lb payload    I simply don't know of a fixed wing capable of carrying this. I'm sure something exists, but it's outside the realm of the hobbyist. There's more than a few co-axial x8 octo copter heavy lifting multirotors that could pick it up easily. But I doubt they could travel 50 or even 20 miles (or even 5 miles) with that much load.    Looking at mostly GPS automated, besides perhaps takeoff and landing.    Regulatory hurdle on that is any commercial use needs the pilot/operator to maintain visual contact.    Big as legally allowed.    Proposed FAA limit 55lb total weight. Combined craft and payload. Some states and municipalities have issues their own tighter regulations.    Appreciate any help.    There's so much here outside my wheelhouse.... I've got a tertiary interest in building a mapping/agri-survey fixed wing that could travel 5+ miles. But I haven't built it yet, and your needs are far-far outside anything I've looked at.   Only suggestions I do have:   Look at co-axial x8 multicopters for lifting that weight. Allows for heavy lifting, large props for efficiency to get you a little more distance, and some redundancy against rotor failures. 20-50 mile distance will still be quite a feet. If stuck on fixed wing due to the range... consider launching from a slingshot. You'll save a good deal of battery power getting it up. And can do so in a much smaller space. Look at Ardupilot an open source flight control system for both multirotors and fixed wings. It has both manual and automated mission setups. Long range testing could be done now with relatively inexpensive smaller fixed wing and multirotors. Just to verify the range feasibility with existing flight control software and telemetry radios or connecting to the mobile network. Once you have that nailed down... then you can use that control system to scale up to a larger build with much more expensive motors/props/ESCs/batteries that can handle the payload. For these smaller long range setups to test the ranges of your control system and deployment scenarios RCgroups, /r/fpv/ and /r/Multicopter can help. There are a few hybrid multirotor/fixed wing conepts out there like the Vertex. It's worth taking a look at the flight time/distance/payload capacity... This isn't an easy problem to solve."

I don't fly by waypoint so I'm not your target audience, but a couple dollars per picture probably means you'd mostly sell to pros who are making money with your data, and there just aren't many pros out there yet.  I bet you'd sell a lot more photos to real estate agents, especially if you had a catalog of photos over major cities, taken at good angles during good times of the year.  But I guess then you're just competing with UAV pictures anyway."
drones,340yls,TedW,2,Mon Apr 27 15:10:07 2015 UTC,"That is similar to what I was thinking. So currently there are groups that are working on providing effectively live satellite images, but these are limited in their ground resolution. And actually what got the conversation going was the earthquake in Nepal the other day, in that rescue efforts are slowed by being unable to target exactly where help needs to go most immediately. Satellites can't see things like individual people (only like damaged buildings), and drones can't cover a big enough area quickly. So if you had a system of live images that could tell you where to send the drone, and then use the drone to ""zoom in"" to see exactly the problem, you could really improve rescue efforts. So I can see a clear use there, but I wanted to look and see if there were uses for civilian pilots as it's often faster/easier to sell to individuals than to Red Cross or something.   The pros flying these drones, are they done exclusively for photography purposes or are there other applications that I'm unaware of? Thanks for answering, UAVs aren't particularly my wheelhouse."

drones,33clvf,JohnFMoore,1 point,Tue Apr 21 13:04:48 2015 UTC,"well that gets tricky. language changes and evolves as the people using it decide what to do with this or that word term etc..  ""technically"" these definitions apply  RC Aircraft typically means a flying remote controlled machine that is a hobby recreational model.  under normal usage the terms UAS and DRONE do not apply to ""model"" airplanes. This has now changed with the advancement of FPV and Computers.  Historically a UAS is an aircraft that is flown by a human pilot who is not ""IN"" the aircraft.  a DRONE is an aircraft that is NOT flown by a human pilot but flown internal by some mechanical/electrical/computing means.  TODAY this typically means a computer IN the aircraft running software. Human's don't FLY the aircraft the computer does and the humans simply tell it what they want it to do.  The term DRONE however is being expanded in the lexicon to now also be applied to pretty much any model aircraft having or suspected to have a camera onboard most typically a ""quad copter"" with camera.  technically because of technology some of our RC Models really are now UAS/Drones.  my Bebop is a legitimate UAS and a Legitimate Drone. In fact it is never a ""normal"" model airplane in the historical sense of the phrase since I never have actual ""manual control"" of the device. it is always flown internally and I give it instructions.  when you fly it via the video camera you now meet the classical definition of UAS.  when you press the RTH (return to home button) that IS now a Drone. it is completely flying itself with no further input from you and heading to a defined destination (hopefully its take off point)  some like my bebop with an upgrade forthcoming and currently say the 3DR Iris + you can even map out and plan a ""Mission"" and then tell the drone. Execute those instructions and it will do it.  they are not very ""smart"" drones (no real capacity for obstacle avoidance etc.. ie if you instruct them to take a path that happens to be through a tree or building they will gladly try and do it)  being a drone does not mean it has to be smart.  Hope that answers your questions. ask away if you need more info."

I got rid of wanting to buy the inspire, i dont think i will need something that heavy for what I am doing. I think the decision is better for the new Phantom 3 vs SOLO instead.   since both seem to be contending in the same price/abilities world.   that being said, i really prefer shooting with a gopro over this new camera they have in mind. simply put, gopro 4 black already has raw, and can shoot 240/120 fps.   what I have been looking into is, if the phantom 3 can have a different gimbal to holster this camera. if so, i think the easy answer is the phantom 3, they have a longer time in the business and have probably worked out many more kinks from their kits then 3DR. though I wish i could get the SOLO simply because of expansions/ high tech seeming interface. and it seems easier to fly.  I come from a remote control background (planes, small copters) so these things are pretty much right up my alley. though practice is the only thing that is going to permit me to make sure i get the shots i want.

DRONE gets a little tricky. language evolves as society decides how they wish to use and apply words.  ie the way a word is used can change by the will of the people using the words.  think xerox or kleenex.  a xerox is not a paper photo copy. it is a company name. but now IT IS a paper photo copy.  kleenex is not a soft napkin you use to wipe your nose. it is a company name. but now IT IS a soft napkin you use to wipe your nose.  historically a DRONE and UAV (two different things) are defined as such by those who created them (military)  a UAV is a piloted aircraft that has no pilot onboard. IE the pilot is on the ground (think typical predator with pilot sitting at a screen computer and joystick flying the predator (some predators later took on DRONE roles as well)  a DRONE is an aircraft that is SELF PILOTED with no people giving direct flight instructions. (move elevator move rudder move throttle)  instead an onboard mechanism or today computer FLIES the aircraft and the humans simple program ""instructions""  go here and do this. and the drone then figures out how exactly to go their and do that.  today however society is starting to ""adopt"" the word drone to mean any small aircraft with a camera or assumed to have a camera.  whether this will stick of expand is unknown.  so technically a QUADCOPTER is just an RC aircraft.  now put a video camera on it so you can fly it without seeing it and it becomes a UAV  hit return to home and put the controller down and it is now technically a drone since it is flying itself based only on the ""instructions"" (go home) that you gave it.  a very very basic drone but technically a drone (one that will try and fly right through a building if one is in the way of its path to home)  a drone does not have to be smart to be a drone. it just has to pilot ITSELF to be a drone."
drones,332rr9,nerys71,1 point,Sun Apr 19 01:12:29 2015 UTC,"Hi, Navy guy here. I'm a submariner so I don't know too much about drones, but I've done a little freelancing and got my private and instrument rated pilots license too, and among most AF or air type navy guys I talk to and among most all hangar talk, a RC is, in fact, the same thing as a drone on its basic principle level. A aircraft that doesn't have a pilot that is controlled from the ground using a radio wave controller.   That being said, drones themselves, as in the types that carry weapons, are controlled from the ground, but most of the flying is left up to the aircraft. In other words it flies itself. The ground controllers essentially just tell it where to go and what to shoot.   Basically, there's no AI in a RC plane. In a drone there is.   Did a little google-ing before I posted this reply; found this.  http://rcflightline.com/drones-vs-radio-controlled-aircraft-a-look-at-the-differences-between-the-two/"
drones,332rr9,krimsonnight,0,Sat Apr 18 23:53:38 2015 UTC,"The word ""drone"" has been used to describe radio controlled aircraft pretty much since they were invented. A drone is an RC aircraft, quadcopters are drones. Some touchy people who are paranoid about the public perception of quadcopters will say, ""Nuh uh, drones are those autonomous aircraft that drop bombs on people!"" ignoring that fact that those drones aren't autonomous either- they're directly controlled by a team of humans. There are also quadcopters and other flying things that can perform autonomous flight and those can also be called drones.   As for public perception, the word you use to describe your flying thing is less important than what you use your flying thing for and how you behave. RC aircraft enthusiasts have been flying responsibly in accordance with laws and regulations for decades and nobody had a problem. The issue going on now is that quadcopters and similar things have become a fad, and relatively affordable, and you have tons of people who buy them and never bother to do any research and also just don't care, and they do reckless things with them. That is where public perception problems come from, not from calling them ""drones""."

drones,332rr9,Schneiderman,0,Sun Apr 19 12:11:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Generally, in the US, you must stay below 400 feet, maintain line of sight, and stay a few miles away from any airports. You should also stay away from any sensitive areas like power plants. And, at the moment, unless you are one of very few people who have gotten an exemption from the FAA, you are not allowed to operate a drone for commercial purposes. If you can adhere to these simple guidelines and also just exercise common sense judgement, you'll be fine."

drones,32ui58,censoredandagain,1 point,Thu Apr 16 22:51:57 2015 UTC,"This is extremely dicey. Suggestion for now is either don't do it or do it for free.  Technically I would not consider selling of video and pictures to equal ""commercial piloting""  the selling of the pictures is completely separate from the flying of the drone. Period.  this would be like being paid to paint a mural (where you painting it flying and the mural is what you captured) and someone simply BUYING an existing painting of mural.  Not the same thing. the FAA disagree's eventually this will get cleared up and likely in our favor. for now you need to tread carefully.  AS LONG AS the buyer can elect to ""buy nothing"" and the pilot gets $0. IE was not paid to fly or hired to fly.  the money can only be for the pictures.  NOW. currently the FAA is in a frenzy to be careful with drones and other aircraft of this sort.  they are not permitted to regulate hobby recreational usage.  they however are permitted to regulate commercial usage and they are using a scatter gun tactic. shoot down ANYTHING commercial so that no one can find a loophole around the restrictions until we get a grasp of the issue if there is an issue.  the issue is NOT YOU flying a drone at a companies event. the issue is an honest to goodness commercial venture doing their thing outside regulation and saying HEY BUT HE DID IT !!!  so they have to bring the ban hammer.  NOW if absolutely no money changes hands you SHOULD be safe. this includes ""second hand"" money on the side/sly. it must be absolutely free.  it would help if he paintballs. this would clearly make it recreational/hobby usage.  what the paintball company does with the footage is outside the lawful pervue of the FAA and they have no legal say.  it would be helpful to develop a signed and agreed upon policy and contract between the flyer and the company officials.  stating that the flyer wishes to fly his drone to video the event. that this was an unsolicited request. This contract is to protect the company and to protect the flyer.  The flyer will not be compensated in any way shape or form to fly and will not be compensated in any way shape or form for the video and is in no way required to give us to the video.  No compensation will change hands in any form at all. no cash no services no perks nothing. 100% recreational flight for the flyers enjoyment.  have everyone sign it. this way if the FAA comes a calling you can forward a copy of the letter. it was a 100% recreational flight with no compensation in any way shape or form before during or after the flight.  they did not offer and I did not ask to be paid to fly record or anything in any form. I elected to give them a copy of the video (and anyone else who asks) and did not apply any restrictions to the video. it is public domain for them to do with as they please. (this is important he has to give up commercial copyright to the video or they can declare its financial usage as profit)  remember. to be commercial you do not have to MAKE ANY MONEY. simply ""attempting"" to make money even if you make not a penny or even take a loss would still qualify as ""commercial""  Commercial does not equal profitable.  Commercial means INTENT to seek profit whether you succeed or not.  it would also help to VET the flyer make sure he is at least compentant and set some ground rules for what he can and can not do where he can and can not fly etc..  it is competant enough to stay within his bounds and not fly into a crowd of people?  oddly enough the players ON the field are safe unless it is a very large quad as they are wearing full face shields that will easy brush off an impact quad of say a bebop or phantom or even an inspire class quad.  it is the bystanders you need to worry about. the ones without face protection."

But these generalizations can help to guide you a bit.    Fixed wings are more efficient (much longer range) and can be buttoned up a bit tighter for rain. MultiRotors are great for very heavy payloads and precision location flying as they can hover in fixed positions even in wind.   For reliability ...    Fixed wings can be setup to glide if the primary rotor fails, or be setup with multiple rotors for some thrust redundancy. Multi Rotors with 6 or more rotors can stay airborne and not fall like a brick with a single rotor failure. With enough thrust to weight ratio 6+ rotor setups can often complete the mission even with a single rotor (motor/prop/esc) failure.   For rapid payload changes...   Fixed wings are a little more susceptible to problems in payload changes as changes in center of gravity make dramatic differences in handling. The flight control systems in Multirotors can compensate for much more dramatic shifts in weight and payload     IMHO it comes down to range, payload weight, and type of control. Will this be manually controlled by an operator with assistance from the flight computer to keep it airborne? or primarily automated, with an operator only monitoring and ready to take control in event of an error?   If long range and more automated I'd go with fixed wing. They are typically overall much lighter setups. If something goes horribly wrong there's less danger to those on the ground. If heavy loads, short range, or very precise locations needed with a more active operator multirotors give you much greater flexibility."

It is so far unknown what kind of accuracy we will need, so I'm just getting to know the options as early as possible.  The flight will be automated as much as possible (probably using the Pixhawk). At the moment I'm leaning more towards the fix-wing option, but there is till time for me to change my mind. Any thoughts on specific fix-wing model to use? I'm thinking a flying-wing, because of the large cargo bay. What do you think?"

I have an ardrone lying around and it wasn't much fun to fly with a touchscreen. But i discovered a windows program that lets you control the ar drone with a laptop called autoflight. It allows you to bind a controller so i used my 360 controller to fly it. The fpv is a lot better (but it's still wifi so useless) but it was pretty great to fly and easy.

In the near future there will be radars that will easily lock on raptors. That's why this is totally pointless.

These 3 are tried and true excellent trainers to prepare for much much more expensive craft. These 3 are available on Amazon:   Hubsan X4 H107L or H107C - $50-$80 - Currently the king of cheap training drones due to easily available and cheap spare parts and batteries.  Great for indoors and ok for outdoors. - And it's ability to fly so well and safely indoors for training even when weather is bad. Syma X5C-1 - $70-$80 - OK for outdoors. BLADE Nano QX BNF $60 + DX5e $60 - Phenomenal indoors, ok for outdoors. And gets you a nice beginner hobby grade transmitter you can use with future BNF or custom builds.   If you want something with more powerful brushless motors, but still relatively beginner ""ready to fly"" for a bit more coin, look into these on Banggood:   Cherson CX20 (GPS) $200-$250 Blade 200 QX BNF $200 + DX5e $60 Flying3D X6 / Flying3D X8 (GPS) $200-$250   Some newly released and yet to be released brushless models worth looking into on banggood and amazon:   V393 $250 - Should have long flight times with nice durability. Hubsan H109 (Not yet released) $200 - The hotly awaited new model from Hubsan.   If none of these strike your fancy, are too much $$, or you want something ""different""  checkout these two models on banggood that are intriguing. Love to have someone try it and give feedback here.   Syma X5SC $66 - Really curious on this update of the venerable Syma X5C.  V323 Hex $120 - With the hex it has more power for outdoor flight that typical brushed toy setups. H12C $80 - Decent flight times in initial reviews with orientation and retrieval features of much more expensive GPS drones."

drones,30r3t0,szahn,7,Mon Mar 30 00:07:29 2015 UTC,"it is a PRICE thing.  you are lifting MASS against the force of gravity on the thrust of ONLY the 3 4 or more propellers you have.  NO wings. NO lift. NO gliding. the Most inefficient form of flight besides a rocket motor typically.  if your drone masses say 2 pounds you MUST generate more than 2 pounds of thrust just to take off and then at least 2 pounds just to sit their and hover.  ie your thrust to weight ration must ALWAYS be greater than 1:1  the VAST majority of RC aircraft do not make anywhere NEAR this much thrust and they do not need to.  you can put that same battery into a powered glider and get double or triple the flight time. more if you thermal or slope it.  want more flight time? you need a bigger battery. now your  motors have to spin even faster to life the bigger battery. Now you need bigger motors which need a bigger batter which needs bigger motors  see the scaling problem?  More flight time means you have to either give up mass or you have to increase power and battery capacity.  both of which tend to be quite expensive as you scale up.  this is part of why an inspire costs $3000 and my bebop is only $500  one is lifting .88 pounds the other is lifting over 4.5 pounds.  it needs over 5 times the thrust and 5 times the battery capacity JUST to EQUAL my bebop.  hence its 5700mah battery versus my 1200mah battery (there is more to it that that you DO gain some efficiency benefits in both the props and the battery tech in larger sizes) and they REDUCE the mass of some parts of the inspire with stronger/lighter materials (carbon fiber mostly)  which is why it is not exactly 5:1 ie I get around 15 minutes flying time inspire gets around 18 minutes.  It has nothing to do with legality. make it larger with a massive battery (which would also result in a more efficient battery) and you can fly as long as you want. or as long as you can afford.  I can not find the video just now but there is a (chinese??) guy on youtube who custom build an octocopter?? and sustained over 1 hours of flying time.  probably cost him a pretty penny too.  this guy went a different route. stripped barebones ultra light weight copter with a massive batterypack  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GajlbrAkAK4  85 minutes flying time.  so what are you willing to give up to get more flight time is the question.  mount a nice camera to that quad and it might be 20 minutes flying time. if it could even lift it.  his quad has nearly 14,000 mah of power (well over twice the inspire) but weights over 1.5 pounds LESS than the inspire.  I am going to have to see about building one like his. wonder if I can gut a bebop to just its camera and mount it on a quad like that. would be wonderful to get 30 or 40 minutes flying time on something like that with a bebop type camera.  but then your adding mass. more and more mass."

So yes you are right, PLA is not very strong  Video transmission : I advise to learn flying LOS (in line of sight) before getting into FPV (first person view). Once you are good at it then you can consider flying fpv. Gopros do have an AV out so you will be able to fly fpv with a gopro as camera. Transmission unit : look for ""boscam 200mw"" and ""boscam receiver"" those are 5,8Ghz systems, also buy or make a circular polarised antenna (google) + a display (goggles or screen)  A radio system is made of 3 parts :  -the controller, with four sticks and sometimes switches. -the transmission module (tx), which gets data from the controller and turns it into a 2,4GHz signal -the receiver (rx)  Controller and tx sometimes come together  I advise you to go to hobbyking.com to get your parts I also like banggood (free shipping and good customer service)  Licenses : depends on your country, google it, propably none if you fly close to you and in line of sight"

drones,2ztxk3,amenadiel,8,Sat Mar 21 19:10:19 2015 UTC,Have you considered the DJI Phantom 2 Vision+ V3.0? Comes in at $1099. I don't think you can go wrong with it to be honest.

drones,2ztxk3,Route66_LANparty,1 point,Sun Mar 22 01:54:13 2015 UTC,"Phantom 2 Vision Plus V3.0. It's hard to beat for ease of use and out of the box performance. It's probably your best option in that general price range.  It's not perfect though... There are some reasons to pause. Or at the very least temper your expectations:   While the drone itself is quite capable of ""long range"" flight and even automated mission runs, the WiFi based video transmission and preview system doesn't maintain extreme range. Especially over areas with dense wifi or 2.4Ghz signals. It will still record, but you won't know exactly what the camera was aimed at till you review the footage. It's more about piloting. Relying only on the drone's camera feed for navigation and piloting is a sure fire way to crash or lose the drone. The product is ridiculously easy to fly... relative to manual flight. It still takes some hand/eye co-ordination and general RC/quadcopter skills. If he's never flown anything like it, he will crash it. What I'm leading into here is that you should also get him a little indoor training drone. Hubsan x4 H107L is available on Amazon as well. $100 can get you the Hubsan, bunch of extra props, batteries and a little case. Let him get his early crashes in on the cheap one instead of the Phantom. Once he can get the Hubsan to simply hover in a place he'll have confidence to take up the Phantom. He won't be an expert... but he'll hopefully stay a little cooler and react calmly to keep the phantom away from obstacles . Overreacting and getting too nervous brings these things crashing down."

drones,2zs6oz,Turdferguson313,3,Sat Mar 21 05:48:58 2015 UTC,"Orientation is key when your starting out. Make sure you understand where the front and back of your copter is, and work to keep the back oriented towards you when your first starting.   Practice flying in a straight line away from you and then pulling back on the stick to bring it back without changing orientation, adjusting left and right stick as needed to keep it aligned with you.  Once you've mastered that practice turning it back towards you and flying the copter back towards you with the orientation facing you (controls will be backward).   Once you've mastered this, flying it will become much more natural and the controls will seem to make much more sense in any situation.  Best of luck."

drones,2zo5gw,neotropic9,2,Fri Mar 20 05:16:48 2015 UTC,"I would say that the AR DRONE is a really good one to start with. It does not require GPS, has two cameras installed that can be used for flight control, positioning, and data acquisition. It also can be upgraded to a handsoff flight operation for roughly $100.   The next step in price would likely be a homebuilt and it would be a good exercise in electronics for the yourself and the students. This can be done for roughly $300 - $500.   From there the Phantom 2 allows use of a GoPro, automated flying, manual flying using GPS, etc. It will cost you around $700.   At this point you can begin thinking about  a DSLR capable flying UAV. It will run into the $3,000 - $5,000 mark. The S-1000 Octocopter is a good entry level, DSLR, professional quality aircraft.   I don't know where you are located but check out the new CNN cooperative with Purdue and contact them directly.

The problem with stuff like the Iris T and the Phantom in a class setting is that they're so expensive that they're essentially a teacher only tool, which kinda defeats the purpose. A somewhat more expensive option is to buy the X4 H107D which is the FPV version. It has the advantage that it sends the video to the controller so you can see what you're filming.

drones,2zmmkm,pantsalwaystooshort,2,Fri Mar 20 03:17:43 2015 UTC,"yes it does and that is the point.  this means they can fly no more than 11 miles roughly (the horizon)  the point is to limit the number and range of these critters until we can get a grasp on them and their effect/impact on the NAS and other traffic.  how reliable? how much trouble? etc.. etc.. etc..  basically for commercial purposes they (correctly) see the potential for thousands or tens of thousands of these things going up in a very short time in a very tiny area. think if amazon delivers 500 products in one day and 10 companies decide to do this with the cost of entry being so low you could be seeing 2500 even 10,000 drones going up in one area in one day.  if even 1% of those ""go wild"" or cause issues your talking 100+ drones going wild or doing something crazy.  I want the FAA as hands off as possible but ""i get it"" regarding their concern and it is legitimate.  which is why they should leave hobby drones alone. they are no threat. your never going to have the ""mass"" you will with commercial drones (density in one area at one time)  With commercial drones the fear is very legitimate.  even for something as simple as roof inspection.  500 people in one city could start doing that tomorrow with what they ALREADY OWN. and $1000 or less gets you into the game.  see the problem? they need to get a grip on what this means and its risks before they do that.

drones,2zmmkm,pantsalwaystooshort,1 point,Fri Mar 20 15:15:45 2015 UTC,"Your critiques have some merit, however the reasoning is flawed. The FAA is applying rules and regulations that have developed in over 100 years of flight to a new type of aircraft.   Amazon was given a special airworthiness certificate, that enables their aircraft to be granted a Certificate of Authorization. This, in essence, is allowing Amazon to certify their aircraft is airworthy under those conditions.   Frankly, there is no Small Unmanned Aircraft System that can meet the level of safety needed to operate throughout the airspace. They cannot meet that standard, and therefore the FAA has had to develop a way to ALLOW commercial test flight.   While the UAV lobby is trying to show the FAA is overbearing and heavyhanded, in reality, the FAA is trying to enable safe, and legal, flight into an already highly evolved system. It is a hard job, and people need to realize that they have responsibilities when operating in the airspace."

drones,2yzthx,Heartless141,1 point,Sat Mar 14 05:41:34 2015 UTC,"The Inspire is a very nice drone, but with that quality comes a fairly high cost. If you are simply using it for video could I recommend doing some research and finding parts to build your own? In the long run this will save you quite a bit of money. Along with the added satisfaction of having built it yourself. If you build one yourself, you can build it to your liking and easily outperform the Inspire in terms of agility and flight times. However, if you have your heart set on an Inspire then I'll answer your questions.   1) No, the second controller is not necessary, there are many packages online with only one controller included. It is unnecessary to have, save the money unless you are flying with a second person.  2)There are gimbal controls on the radio. Generally they are knobs that you turn to adjust the camera.   3) The max flight time you can get is 18 minutes with the Inspire. You will probably be getting a few minutes less than that, so I would count on 10-15 depending on your aggressiveness, location, height, and weather.  4)It would be helpful to know what your graduation project is before making recommendations.  EDIT: The Iris+ in my opinion would be a better choice than the Inspire. There is much more customizability as well as a huge userbase."

drones,2yzi6j,Vailhem,1 point,Sat Mar 14 03:36:28 2015 UTC,"that depends. define small drone?  absolutely nothing fi it hits 99% of the airliner.  if it is sucked into an air intake (engine) depending on the drone there is a chance it could cause damage and take out that engine (like it eating a bird)  the probability of this happening is so small it can for the most part be ignored. that is until you have a LOT of them.  not a lot of people flying drones but a high DENSITY of drones flying in the same space (such as commercial expansion of drone usage think amazon delivery)  then the risk goes up exponentially as you increase the odds of a drone and an airplane trying to occupy the same space at the same time.  for the most part for a small light drone (such as a sub 2 pound hobby drone) the chance of any damage not to speak of an encounter is essentially zero.  this is why ""airline drone citings"" are restricted to AIRPORTS (the one place any model aircraft SHOULD NOT BE)  high density of aircraft."

I mean, airports with 'no drone/no fly' zones alone would drastically reduce the risk.  I mean, how often is a plane really flying low enough to hit a drone? ... take off & landing... that's about it.  initial ascent or descent but... again, 'no fly zones for drones' (said Soup Nazi-style) would seemingly reduce this drastically.  That leaves small planes & helicopters ... and, again, the likelihood of this is so minimal, in my imagination, any helicopter that hits a drone... and... anyone that lets their drone be hit by a helicopter... was essentially asking for this seemingly nearly-entirely avoidable incident from happening."
drones,2yzi6j,nerys71,2,Sun Mar 15 07:45:10 2015 UTC,"that is my point. NO model aircraft should be flown within the confines of an airport without explicit permission PERIOD.  SIMPLY BECAUSE the density of aircraft is so high.  OUTSIDE airports controlled airspace (few miles) the density of aircraft is so low that HOBBY aircraft ""ARE"" for all relevant purposes 0 risk to aircraft.  Commercial aircraft of ""model size""  that changes everything. maybe. what happens when 1000 people all over the nation launch their drones? nothing.  what happens when 3000 drones are launches INSIDE a single city in a single day.  now things could potentially change drastically. you are dramatically increasing the DENSITY of aircraft.  a BIRD is not a danger to an airplane in MOST instances.  A FLOCK OF BIRDS is a very large danger.  see what I mean?  hobby drones will never ""flock"" commercial drones VERY well could (think amazon delivery by drone)  if one drone ""goes wild"" nothing really happens. what is 1 in 100 drones ""goes wild"" (flies outside its programming) and your flying 10,000 drones a week.... that is 100 drones a week flying wild.  changes things quite a bit. this is why I am OK with the FAA clamping down (reasonably) on commercial drones. at least until we can figure out what kind of risk we are talking about.  what I don't like is them taking what is ""OTHERWISE"" a hobby drone and declaring it ""commercial"" simply because commercial is ""attached"" somewhere.  for example I simply do not consider a real estate agent taking a picture with a toy to be what congress meant when they said ""commercial flying"""
drones,2yzi6j,nerys71,1 point,Mon Mar 16 02:09:04 2015 UTC,"I really have nothing to add because I agree with all of it.  my only wonder is: what if they put radar into drones in such that the drone could detect an oncoming 'something' and be auto-programmed to 'take action' (which would basically mean turn off the engines and drop as quickly as possible ... turning engines back on once the 'minimal safe distance' is achieved and/or the ground is right there)  again,with everything else you've written... totally agree. nothing to add."

There's no enforcement of the rule, other than asking hobbyists to volunteer.  In another article, a person was using a drone to show real estate. He got an FAA complaint as well."
drones,2yza8f,happycrabeatsthefish,0,Sat Mar 14 07:53:12 2015 UTC,"Banned: FAA Says It Is Illegal To Post Drone Videos on YouTube- But Drone Striking American Citizens Is Authorized  Mac Slavo - Mar 13, 2015  If you’re like millions of other drone hobbyists in America who like to post their captured videos on YouTube then you could soon be receiving a legal notice from the Federal Aviation Administration.  Under existing FAA guidelines flying a drone for personal use is completely legal, as is recording video of your drone flight.  But if you use the drone for commercial purposes, say for example to record an aerial view of a real estate property listing, then you’d be breaking the law.  But the FAA just found another loophole in their efforts to curb the popularity of drones.  It turns out that if you record a drone flight video and post it on YouTube you may be breaking the law if an automatic advertisement is launched within the video.  According to the FAA, because you make a few pennies off of that advertisement you are now using your video in a commercial capacity.  The consequences, according to the FAA, include fines and sanctions:  Earlier this week, the agency sent a legal notice to Jayson Hanes, a Tampa-based drone hobbyist who has been posting drone-shot videos online for roughly the last year.  The FAA said that, because there are ads on YouTube, Hanes’s flights constituted a commercial use of the technology subject to stricter regulations and enforcement action from the agency.  It said that if he did not stop flying “commercially,” he could be subject to fines or sanctions.  “This office has received a complaint regarding your use of an unmanned aerial vehicle (aka drone) for commercial purposes referencing your video on the website youtube.com as evidence,” the letter reads.  “After a review of your website, it does appear that the complaint is valid.”  (Full FAA Letter: http://www.scribd.com/doc/258492727/FAA-YouTube)  As is generally the case, the government has created regulations that are not only confusing to the public, but open for broad interpretation by enforcement officials as they see fit:  Where, exactly, does commercial use begin and hobby use end, for instance? If you fly for fun, but happen to sell your footage later, were you flying for a “commercial purpose?”  What if you give it to a news organization that runs it on a television station that has ads on it?  What if you upload it to YouTube and Google happens to put an ad on it?  What if you decide to put an ad on it?  The argument may soon be moot, however, as the recent crash-landing of a drone on the White House lawn that was being operated by a government intelligence employee may have far-reaching implications for hobbyists.  Some politicians have already mentioned banning drones for personal use because of the security threats they pose.  The deployment of armed military surveillance drones on U.S. soil that have authorization to kill American citizens without charge or trial, however, will remain completely legal.  http://www.activistpost.com/2015/03/banned-faa-says-it-is-illegal-to-post.html"

It is hands down my favorite.

I really wish they had an affordable brushless version of it. they do have one the V393 but it is $265. ouch.  I have upper and lower shaft bearings coming in to improve performance and extend life.  got a spare set of motors coming too just because they were only $3.80 a pop and I was buying the upgraded tramsmitter (with more control buttons for the add on accessories)  if I ever want to let someone else ""try quad flying"" without hesitation this is what I bring it.  it looks impressive because of its size and this also makes it VERY easy to see and orient and its sheer size also makes it very docile.  the 6axis works very well no yaw slip to speak of."

drones,2y7knu,jucahe,1 point,Sat Mar 7 06:35:59 2015 UTC,ohhh a week is tough things might not ship that fast. definitely not as good prices at least.  priorities would be spare motors and props. cheap if you order from china not quite so cheap if you order from the US.  it is my understanding that the motors (brushed) begin to fade/fail at around 30 to 50 flights. from china (banggood) the motors are only $3.80 a pop few bucks for a set of props.  Bearing Upgrade. (upper and lower separate sets) $8 a set. not sure if you can order and receive inside a week though.  from what I gather $265 is a great price for what it is (the only cheaper one I found was the blade 200 qx for $209.) It is just not that instant buy now don't even have to think about it $60 price of the v262 :-)  I have been looking into upgrading the 262 to brushless but it seems complicated. you need some AEO converters and then 4 ESC's and likely a larger battery to power it all and 4 motors of course and I Have no idea if it will work or not.
drones,2y7knu,thatrugbylad,1 point,Sat Mar 7 06:46:01 2015 UTC,"Just in case, the bearings are 3x6x2 mm. 3x6x2.5 also fit and are a little cheaper.  I also recommend the v262, it's way worth the value. I'm waiting for a fpv kit to arrive so I can test the range. I've flown it maybe 70 meters up in the sky but had to bring it down, It was too far away for me to feel comfortable without fvp.   Something that a lot of people recommend is to break in the motors by letting them run for one or two batteries at the minimum power. I did that and they are working perfectly after some 15 flights.  One last thing, buy extra batteries. No need for larger ones, the 850mah are fine, adding more weight and having longer flights could add more stress to the motors. In my opinion it's better to have shorter flights and some cool down time between flights."

And as for your gopro check the settings you have ie 1080/24fps ect.
