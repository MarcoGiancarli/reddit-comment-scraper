CubeWorld,3e0760,sas41,4,Tue Jul 21 00:42:06 2015 UTC,"I'm a believer but I'm not on this hype train.  Wollay isn't the type to target the two year anniversary of the last update.  He'll release the next update on some random Tuesday in some unremarkable month and it will be much more exciting because we won't have expected it.  It's fun to believe and be hyped, it's true, but I strongly feel that all the 23rd is going to do is excite the dumbasses who do nothing but bitch at Wollay's fans because if Wollay doesn't think the update is ready by the 23rd then clearly he stopped working on it and never plans to release it."

CubeWorld,3e0760,TheEmeraldCat,26,Tue Jul 21 00:30:25 2015 UTC,Because it's fun. Three days or so of hype for about 10 minutes of disappointment? Hell yeah I'd take that. Every day of the week. Hype is just fun sometimes.

You're letting your love for cube world cloud your judgement and it isn't contributing anything to the thread, he's looking for a similar game and I gave him one."
CubeWorld,3dtcph,AyraVarwin,3,Sun Jul 19 18:53:17 2015 UTC,"Skysaga is good, though no matter how you look at it, it is inferior to cubeworld. If you are willing to wait. you could try LIVE LOVE FARM by Giawa when it is released."

CubeWorld,3dtcph,AyraVarwin,2,Sun Jul 19 07:39:35 2015 UTC,Trove looks like cubeworld and that's where the similarities end. They're nothing alike gameplay wise
CubeWorld,3dtcph,AkariAkaza,5,Sun Jul 19 21:57:50 2015 UTC,"To be fair, that's mostly because cubeworld hasn't added anything gameplay wise. It's still just a world to run around in doing the basics. In that regard they are very similar. Trove has just gone on to create their game around it. At this point cubeworld could go in any direction."
CubeWorld,3dtcph,Tramd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:18:43 2015 UTC,"Explore a voxel based world as a character you level up while defeating monsters. Yup, nothing similar in those at all. /s  Seriously though, you can't deny the similarities."

CubeWorld,3dtcph,Pinkishu,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:26:18 2015 UTC,So if a game is made of blocks it's similar to cube world?
CubeWorld,3dtcph,ProfPixel,4,Sun Jul 19 21:55:07 2015 UTC,"No, if a game is a free roam RPG set in a sandbox made of procedurally placed voxels organized into not environmentally placed (Minecraft uses humidity tables, etc. Trove and Cube World use simpler themes), but thematically placed biomes full of dungeons with minibosses and small event based quests, with simple combat dynamics and interesting classes, and many modes of transportation, and a cartoonish graphical style. Then it is similar to Cube World."
CubeWorld,3dtcph,Arsonide,4,Mon Jul 20 14:28:56 2015 UTC,"As someone who has tried both, I can honestly say that they feel completely different! Cube World is amazing of the way the world feels pure, untouched, and different! Trove can be messed with, worlds are kinda cool but they just are are meant for destruction! The point is that they aren't the same, and there are many other examples to prove this! But if you can't see that I suggest you visit /r/trove for all your trove needs."
CubeWorld,3dtcph,ProfPixel,-2,Mon Jul 20 15:11:34 2015 UTC,Why is this being downvoted?
CubeWorld,3dtcph,FrostyJesus,8,Sun Jul 19 08:51:20 2015 UTC,cause trove sucks balls
CubeWorld,3dtcph,shamazam,7,Sun Jul 19 09:41:02 2015 UTC,"Why does it suck? could someone explain. I have heard of it, but never actually seen it played."
CubeWorld,3dtcph,Paperiolento,12,Sun Jul 19 13:04:55 2015 UTC,"It's very similar to Cube World, but it has more content, and active developers. The community here is somewhat jaded about it though, and will likely downvote this. They like to say that it's targeted at children, or that all there is to do in the game is collect things. Neither one of these things is true. I suggest you check out the game for yourself, rather than trust the judgement of those here, who have been stuck in a dead subreddit for two years waiting on a patch that might not ever come."
CubeWorld,3dtcph,Arsonide,9,Sun Jul 19 13:38:47 2015 UTC,"I tried the game myself because I was interested but I agree with the ""It Sucks"" people, it really doesn't feel like cubeworld and a very easy biased way to describe it for me personally is a 3d version of 8bit mmo."
CubeWorld,3dtcph,Fuey500,3,Sun Jul 19 16:40:56 2015 UTC,"I really don't understand this sentiment. The classes are similar, with limited skill selection. The gear is similar, with incremental numerical upgrades. There are similar modes of transport, through similar biomes. The biomes are similar, similarly filled with lairs and dungeons, with little mini quests at each one, culminating in a boss. The art style is similar with cel shading. If you can't draw the similarities between Trove and Cube World, you are not trying very hard, or you are trolling.  Note that I am talking about drawing similarities between the games. I can understand if people prefer one over the other, but saying ""they are nothing like each other"" is clear cut flat out incorrect."
CubeWorld,3dtcph,Arsonide,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:12:31 2015 UTC,"To me its just the whole overall feel.  In Cube World you have a world, you go explore that world. You find dungeons, quests, npcs, the world looks pretty. You can glide about, level up your skills, get better etc. The world just feels more coherent and on-the-ground, like it is actually there.  In Trove you have the hub where people jump about all, then you have the throwaway adventure worlds which are dead after 30 mins in theres a new one made. You reach your maximum potential (sans equip) in an hour or something after getting a class. You change classes on the fly, worlds on the fly. Cashshop. Fall damage is weird, movement feels fuzzy and floaty...  I guess thats the best way to describe Trove: Floaty. Some classes (or all?) don't even have their bodyparts attached to their actual bodies. And you can just swiss cheese up the world too.  The combat feels very imprecise and... floaty...  Yeah... I'm okay with Trove but I don't see it feeling anywhere like Cube World"
CubeWorld,3dtcph,Pinkishu,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:32:11 2015 UTC,The game is not cel-shaded. Nor is cube world.

CubeWorld,3dtcph,Bonedeath,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:03:55 2015 UTC,It has nothing to do with being a cube world fan.. Trove is not fun for me. The gameplay is clunky and I'm not into the art style.. just because it's voxel doesn't mean they're the same game. That's like saying COD and CSGO are the same game because they're both FPS.
CubeWorld,3dtcph,Bonedeath,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:03:10 2015 UTC,"As I stated above, having a preference is fine, but stating they are entirely dissimilar is not accurate. There are many similarities other than voxels listed above, if you care to read them."

Anyways the ones I know about have already been said but to save you the trouble of looking at all of them I will put the ones I know of here. I haven't played most of them but I found them when I was searching for a game with any similarity to cube world. unfortunately My search came up dry other then a list of similar games that ether didn't have what I was looking for had a different game mechanic/problem that drove me away.   -->Vox (development abandoned)  -->Trove (note: not made with solo play in mind)  -->Sky Saga (I know nothing about it since I only just read it from TheGameingReavers post)  --> Astral Terra (Sandbox RPG with a Voxel World)  -->and finally Minecraft. True Minecraft is not similar other then the fact that it uses voxels but with all the mods it has, I have no doubt that with a certain combination of mods, you will find what your looking for... the problem is how much work do you want to put into finding and putting them together in a working fashion.  Hope you find your answer in this small list. I know I saw more but I cant remember them at the moment."

CubeWorld,3dtcph,Tiger2kill,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:17:48 2015 UTC,"The two that I have played that have similar play styles are Sky Saga, and the fan favorite, Trove. Lets start with Sky Saga. It's pretty boring. Onto Trove! Trove is amazing! It has most of the same things Cube World has but with many, many more features! It's a mmo so it's easier to play with friends! You can actually build in it! There are currently 11 unique classes! You can craft amazing mounts! And the best part of all... The devs aren't dead! They update every week on Tuesday! They have a new class almost every month! The devs listen to what you have to say instead of ignoring you and never talking! Trove is also free so no loss in trying it out even if you end up not liking it unlike Cube World where you are throwing you're money at a dead project! Trove isn't a pay to win mmo either! You have so many options on what to do to keep yourself entertained! 99% of the equipment and dungeons are player made! That gives the devs more time to work on new classes and features! Trove came out more recently than cube world and already has more content! I have played since August of last year and still play it to this day! If any one wants to get a hold of me in game my ign is TheGamingReaver! Let the down votes commence!"
CubeWorld,3dtcph,TheGamingReaver,0,Tue Jul 21 00:51:38 2015 UTC,"I feel like you are way to excited over Trove. I played it and hit max level then got bored of it immediately. The only end-game content is you trying to max out your gear using a RNG rolling system. Oh, and now you can fish. Whoo?"

CubeWorld,3dtcph,TheGamingReaver,0,Tue Jul 21 00:54:24 2015 UTC,"I don't see what there is to compare to cubeworld with trove since cubeworld has next to nothing for content. At their core it's a voxel based adventure game where you can run around, find little points of interest, climb mountains and explore. That's about it because then trove goes on to build a game and cubeworld hasn't left that stage yet."

CubeWorld,3djdjt,SocksofGranduer,12,Thu Jul 16 19:26:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think the people here are underestimating the amount of effort it takes to post on twitter, though."
CubeWorld,3djdjt,electrohedd,2,Fri Jul 17 00:41:26 2015 UTC,Perhaps it's a similar situation to icefrog and the western Dota 2 community. He doesn't talk to them any more because he got a whole load of abuse for posting a picture of his cat.   Maybe a very large number of people being very angry at wollay is what brought him to not tweeting any more.
CubeWorld,3djdjt,kersplodey,5,Fri Jul 17 07:18:54 2015 UTC,Maybe a very large number of people being very angry at wollay is what brought him to not tweeting any more.   I think it's the other way around.
CubeWorld,3djdjt,RimeboundNinja,2,Sat Jul 18 00:07:07 2015 UTC,"Or, he's had to scrap his plans every three months, and didn't want to have to say 'sorry I lied I'm actually doing it this way' every time he did that for the last 4 years. Then we'd just be complaining about broken promises instead of no contact."
CubeWorld,3djdjt,SocksofGranduer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:45:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the Starbound community was similarly furious about a disconnect between promises and progress, and they were far better funded and a far larger dev team.  But unlike Cube World, they managed to turn things around. The community feel got worlds better once they started writing up a weekly dev blog of what everyone on their team had worked on, and pushing out an unstable branch regularly to go along with it.  That's not to say more blog posts and updates fix everything. Tiyuri and co got hit with tons of vitriolic backlash even after they started posting more updates. There were several incidents of updates followed by ""why are you working on X when Y is clearly broken and ruining the game.""  You also can't make everybody happy. For any change you make, even if it's an improvement that makes most people happy, you could still piss off a minority of old players who felt like the old style was part of the game's charm.  I think those two issues above are why Wollay tries to hide from the cube world community. That and because he's basically working alone, progress would never be enough to satisfy users."
CubeWorld,3djdjt,toaste,6,Sat Jul 18 23:12:09 2015 UTC,"Agreed, not to mention that from what the most recent source says, wollay said he had to remake it from scratch because it wasn't up to par on what he had envisioned.  Honestly we have 2 people working their hearts out for a game that, they wanted to re-code/reprogram the game for mac and add a whole new  quest system. (I just worked on a two day project with canvas making a game. and adding in a specific thing after you have laid the ground work out means you will have to move code around to make it work right, 1 /2 - 2 hours just to redo spawning on a 2-D scroller thing about a 3-D randomly generated world) and they get so much hate for doing what they loved."
CubeWorld,3djdjt,k4b6,2,Fri Jul 17 01:16:05 2015 UTC,"I'd rather have 2 years of constant updates, fixed and tweaks to the quest system, while players can voice opinions on it, so the devs get feedback from actual players. But, yeah.."
CubeWorld,3djdjt,Pinkishu,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:50:42 2015 UTC,It does not take 2 years to develop a quest system. Developing aspects such as the level generation or AI would be a larger task than quests; and they did not take years to create.
CubeWorld,3djdjt,IAmFeltip,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:55:29 2015 UTC,"It's always funny when people like you make statements like this. You think every developer has a team of 10-20 people with them to make games quickly? No... It's all about work ethic and the type of game.  For example, FTL: Faster Than Light was two guys that started the project in 2011 and finished it in 2012, with a bit of help at the very end from 2 other people for writing and soundtrack stuff. It was a 2D game with not a ton of animations, so ~1.5 years is logical. Cube World also has 2 people, it's been 4 years since development started. And 2 years since they received funding similar to a Kickstarter campaign (for purposes of argument in comparison to FTL's Kickstarter funding). The game doesn't need to be finished. However it would be very nice if we were kept in the loop on the progress.  The primary problem is not development speed. It's the complete and total lack of caring about the consumer base and the fan base. A single 50 character post on Twitter every couple of weeks is worth infinitely more than an update that may come out sometime in the next 5 years.  No one is asking for promises. They just want communication."
CubeWorld,3djdjt,Patchumz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:52:20 2015 UTC,"Well it's a good thing you were just talking about people like me, and not about me. Otherwise those statements could have been perceived as passive aggressive stereotypes or something. :P"

And like many hobbies, people who have talent in playing video games don't suddenly have skills in making them.  Also, the community would have to do it for free (why would anyone do that), or try telling a community that already coughed up 20 bucks to cough up more money.  This isn't a good idea."
CubeWorld,3djdjt,Darkersun,5,Thu Jul 16 22:28:43 2015 UTC,Has no one seen that news article on CW recently that states that the devs even claimed that the game's still alive and that it was taking WAY longer than expected?

CubeWorld,3djdjt,RivetSpawn,2,Thu Jul 16 22:38:17 2015 UTC,Well so far it's 2 years and counting. About as likely to get an update with a basic quest system as we are a completed game.
CubeWorld,3djdjt,Tramd,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:00:14 2015 UTC,"It's funny, it's always someone suggesting to make an open-source project, but none of them have the balls to actually do it themselves (including me).

CubeWorld,3cxpb1,Cirlex,6,Sat Jul 11 22:21:10 2015 UTC,"The tech preview of Win 10 is free for anyone to try, and can even install through windows update. People have been using it for over a year now, official release is in 2 weeks on July 29th."

CubeWorld,3cxpb1,JankClonk,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:45:04 2015 UTC,"nope. https://insider.windows.com/. They want as many people to use it as possible, they are squashing every bug they can before it is released. It's working out extremely well for them."
CubeWorld,3cxpb1,MegaHz,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:04:51 2015 UTC,That's cool.  One last question....Do they update the bugs on the preview to avoid any repeated bug reports?
CubeWorld,3cxpb1,JankClonk,3,Sun Jul 12 05:53:20 2015 UTC,"yup, thats the point. They have had over a million people running windows 10 for the past 9 months, with bi-weekly updates. It will be the first version of windows that is super solid on release."

CubeWorld,3cxpb1,ThrowinAwayTheDay,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:53:09 2015 UTC,"There is a new version released to the fast ring about once a week.  As of the latest build they just put in the logic to start seperating updates to move towards release. Now would be a decent time to jump in if you want to see Windows 10.   Keep in mind you probably still don't want to do this on your primary computer just in case, with that being said I personally have only had minor bugs and use it for gaming."

It felt polished, despite being such an early release, if all these years of silence means that polish continues to shine, I'm alright with waiting another couple of years."
CubeWorld,3cwr68,Squishydew,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:42:17 2015 UTC,This! This is the attitude we need on this sub! Wollay just wants it to be perfect! Would you rather a half baked cake? Or one with icing and frosting and baked to perfection??

CubeWorld,3cwr68,MrSneak,7,Tue Jul 21 23:58:13 2015 UTC,"At the current rate of updates (Wich is none) I would not be surprised if I see a ""Beta"" label on the update that comes eventually and then another 2-3 years of silence and no updates for a release labaled game. That'd be the realistic train of tought now. Hope that this will not be the case, but a more persistent schedule after the upcoming update, but that is very optimistic rather than realistic. Can also go pessimistic and say Next update will be a alpha labeled one and in 1-2 years time."
CubeWorld,3cwr68,EmilAFN,3,Sat Jul 11 14:40:04 2015 UTC,"To be honest I would much prefer a huge update every couple of years. Weekly or monthly updates have ruined a lot of games for me, especially buggy ones. Devs these days just don't spend a lot of time on things so they can keep up, but quality suffers. Although Wollay should communicate more, I'm a developer who knows many developers who won't do anything other than work until they're happy with how things are. He's definitely that type, but games don't typically have them in the public eye because they have someone to handle PR stuff.  EDIT: Then again I followed this game like a year before release so I knew what I was getting into in terms of how Wollay acts."
CubeWorld,3cwr68,EmilAFN,2,Sat Jul 11 14:47:44 2015 UTC,"Found the game 4 years ago and followed the development of it. And it was possible then, since he did several pictures, text and sometimes videos every 2-3 months back then before release of Alpha. Not it seems to be around every 1-2 years."
CubeWorld,3cwr68,Derringer,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:57:32 2015 UTC,"If I had to guess I would say that's because he has the money to take as much time as he needs now. He doesn't feel the need to say anything because all there is to say is ""I'm working on quests."" Can you imagine how stupid people would get if he communicated each time he scrapped the quest system? People can't handle that kind of info, look at Star Citizen... That being said, Wollay should at least send out a screenshot once in a while."
CubeWorld,3cwr68,altiris28048,3,Sat Jul 11 15:26:35 2015 UTC,"People expect to be told about everything from devs though. They need a constant flow of information.  Even if the game never gets made, I played over 40 hours with friends and enjoyed it. I already got my money's worth out of it. I realized not everyone did though."
CubeWorld,3cwr68,Derringer,0,Sun Jul 12 11:46:23 2015 UTC,"All I really want is just a sense of security. Once Wollay does ever release this update I will have my faith in him and truly believe that he just has very slow development times. I won't mind waiting another 2 or 3 years for him to ""deliver"" or be unsure whether he will or not because it's been done already in the past and I have a little more trust in him."
CubeWorld,3cwr68,EmilAFN,0,Wed Jul 15 13:20:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not condoning his lack of updates, don't get me wrong. I would love it if the game updated somewhat soon."
CubeWorld,3cwr68,green715,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:00:15 2015 UTC,"But that went off topic, sorry about that.  Content I hope to see in the update will be the quest system he is working on, hopefully bigger skill trees for more variation. Perhaps a new class (2 years is a long time) and ALOT more different smaller things that just simply fill in the game world with wonderful things."
CubeWorld,3cwr68,OldManBilly,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:29:01 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree on the skill tree bit. I don't mind limited classes if we can build different ways. Although that might require changing item generation to support new stats, depending on how the skills scale."

CubeWorld,3cwr68,Blubbll,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:27:34 2015 UTC,"Have you guys ever wondered, Wollay might have taken 5 years to get the game into it's alpha stage and sell it to everyone, who knows?  After all, it's just he and his wife working on it (correct me if im wrong). Compared to that, 2 years for beta isn't really much at all :) Just have patience :)"
CubeWorld,3cwr68,Cirlex,-1,Sun Jul 12 07:33:23 2015 UTC,"If the update comes it will probably just have a questing system and a couple of new animals, not really 2 years worth of content."

CubeWorld,3cvh2h,2nddimension,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:52:43 2015 UTC,"I think the Yogscast used to work tightly with him. How much that's still true and if they have any authority at all is written in the stars, although losing credibility probably wouldn't be good for their image, so they'd make sure it's not completely unsourced.  We'll see."

But hey, just my opinion, I'll still holding out hope."
CubeWorld,3ct8vi,Laffbert,44,Fri Jul 10 17:16:47 2015 UTC,"Personally, I prefer the two year game development period. The update scheme ruins game depth, since you get fed the features in little portions and are burnt out quickly. Especially in a game that's about exploring that would get boring fast.  Nonetheless, a few posts of ""Hey, I'm still alive"" and little hints for hype would be nice. ""Funckstille"" doesn't feel good :|"
CubeWorld,3ct8vi,TLATER,6,Fri Jul 10 17:42:06 2015 UTC,That's how I got burnt out with Minecraft. I'd always install the new snapshots and it would suck out all my enthusiasm for the actual update whenever they'd finally drop it.
CubeWorld,3ct8vi,Forallmydeadhomies,5,Fri Jul 10 20:02:28 2015 UTC,"From a development standpoint a two year dev cycle is far, far worse. Smaller incremental updates allow for more efficient testing, feedback, issue discovery and resolution, continuous improvement, etc.   When two years of changes get releases and people start finding issues, you're potentially going to have to look back at something you wrote 2 years ago. What's more, you may need to refactor 2 years worth of code to fix something.   It's ultimately up to Wollay of course, but just speaking as a developer this is like the worst possible thing you could do and ultimately lengthens not only the cycle time of feature releases, but also the cycle time of bug fixes."
CubeWorld,3ct8vi,ihatethissite,5,Fri Jul 10 21:35:16 2015 UTC,"Developer-to-be here, and I disagree. A two year cycle allows you to have time to fix the bugs before it's released to public; testing procedures should be accounted for in any development cycle.  Releasing after two years doesn't mean your code won't be tested at all, the testing just isn't public. And if you feel it would improve the consumer's experience it is the more ethical option, even if some slight patching might be required after release (major issues should have been caught beforehand, making patches minor and not game-breaking).  Selling a broken game is just not right IMO. Wollay seems to agree, and even if it seems like a worse option I'd rather not use my consumers as lab rats. My name is not Ubisoft, after all."
CubeWorld,3ct8vi,TLATER,7,Fri Jul 10 23:00:50 2015 UTC,"This would make sense in a larger company with a dedicated testing team and hardware, but it's impossible to account for a reasonable amount of hardware/software issues related to a 2 year track of work with just 2 people. Especially when those people are also the ones doing the actual development. I'm not suggesting that buggy software be released. I am suggesting that there will be bugs regardless, and fixing a bug embedded behind 2 years of code is a lot harder than fixing a bug you introduced a week ago.   Excluding the initial release (which should be the minimum viable product) it's almost always better to deliver in small increments and adapt software changes based on customer feedback  (although admittedly Wollay does not seem interested in customer feedback).   This is pretty well accepted among the dev community, and is one of the reasons agile development is favored over other SDLC methodologies by almost all major tech companies.   This is coming from someone who engineers enterprise level solutions, so I may be completely wrong in this case, but in my personal experience, small dev cycles have always been far more efficient."
CubeWorld,3ct8vi,ihatethissite,3,Fri Jul 10 23:30:58 2015 UTC,"And your developer to be thoughts are incorrect.  No matter how much internal QA you do, you will never release a perfected product.  Short of academia and using discrete math to hard verify it, it's never going to happen.  It's far better for something to be incrementally released than a huge development cycle.  As /u/ihatethissite mentioned, looking back at code you initially wrote (and found no bugs with internally) 2 years ago is going to be a week's worth of work trying to decipher it, regardless of how many comments and documents you had.  And there will be cases like this, because why would you ever read over code that you know works when there are other bugs to fix or features to implement?"
CubeWorld,3ct8vi,ColinStyles,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:25:46 2015 UTC,"I'm absolutely aware of that. The reason I would still go for a huge development cycle is ethics, not technical concerns.  I am talking only about game development here. For other applications agile development is certainly better, there's no reason to surprise a customer. That would actually be rather bad.  The project can be continued after release... It's not like the project needs to be done and perfect after two years. And with bug testing throughout development the amount of two year old bugs will be minimal and not necessarily much higher than when there has been public testing. And hey, why not ensure very important and complex parts are correct so that only small bugs can occur?  If some non game-breaking bugs need two or three weeks after release to be fixed I doubt that's a major problem... For a computer game, at least.  I would feel much better releasing when I feel my game is finished and at most has a few slight problems than when I haven't even thought up all features... And that's the issue."
CubeWorld,3ct8vi,TLATER,5,Wed Jul 15 09:30:16 2015 UTC,Agreed.

CubeWorld,3ct8vi,Fuey500,2,Fri Jul 10 21:39:22 2015 UTC,"Of the Early Access games I follow I've seen different patterns. Space Engineers, Medieval Engineers and Rust who release a update every single week scheduled for a specific day. It's fun but the updates are very often small in size. I've also got Damned and Timber & Stone who is more ""random"" with their updates and it can go from 1 week to half a year between updates. The jewel of them all, in my personal opinion, is Prison Architect who does a update at the end of every month bringing big and small changes. If only more Early access games would follow their pattern... I'd be a happy supporter.  But the way Cube World have done it... I've kept my hopes up. But been very sad every anniversary that goes by for last tweet, update and release."
CubeWorld,3ct8vi,EmilAFN,2,Fri Jul 10 21:01:52 2015 UTC,The whining about the game is going to be off the charts. It could very well be an entirely different experience than what people have come to love from having nothing but a sandbox world to run around in.

The fact that he's apparently responded to the media is leaving me thinking it's more the first than the second, given it's run opposite to all of his previous behavior.  I keep taking flak for this because the word has lost all meaning, but it's very likely he's extremely autistic.  He simply doesn't know how to handle any kind of social interaction, doesn't understand social requirements/assumptions, and fled from any and all attention.  Couple that with his insane level of perfectionism, you've got a pretty good case for it."

CubeWorld,3ct8vi,Wemwot,2,Sat Jul 11 01:47:57 2015 UTC,Redesigning the quest system 3 times since that video?! No wonder it's taking him so long.  It makes me more excited to know that the game will be almost a completely new world to explore again!
CubeWorld,3ct8vi,Alps709,-2,Fri Jul 10 21:29:14 2015 UTC,"Yep. I really don't get why people act like Cubeworld is the only game in the world. I have too many fucking games to play. I'm glad a game I really enjoyed once is going to feel almost completely new so I can have another great experience with it. Steady updates would have been fine too, but there is objectively nothing wrong with holding all updates for a massive patch. It's not like I have to actively ""wait"" for it. How do you wait for something like this? You are waiting for it no matter what you do. It's not like waiting for a bus where I'm stuck at the bus stop and can choose to either sit there or take a cab or something. It's just something that's going to happen at some point in the future, and in the meantime my life can proceed as normal."

I don't think it's too much to ask for him to tweet ""yea we're still here"" every once and a while especially when a large part of the community feels like they've been cheated because of the lack of communication from the devs.  I honestly could care less about how he's changed the questing, just hearing that he's still alive and working on it is enough for me and a lot of other people.  If he releases it this year or the next year or whatever I'm fine with that, but the fact that I have to go to kotaku to find this stuff out is pretty infuriating considering I paid money for this game and have continued to show my support on YT and other sites.  But that's just my (and a lot of other people's) 2 cents."

I'm calling bullshit. There's just no way a quest system requires this much work, there's just no way. He must be the worst dev in the world. It's kind of sad how everyone is getting their hopes up again. Nothing new happened, this is the same as the occasional person posting here about receiving a mail from Wollay, except it's on Kotaku. They're just gamers too, nothing special really. He just has a bunch of basic emails lying around which he copy pastes. Empty promises, all it is.     edit: What I meant by Kotaku being ""nothing special really"" I meant in the context of CubeWorld development. They have no more insight than the average person receiving an email."
CubeWorld,3ct8vi,Dicethrower,4,Fri Jul 10 18:03:20 2015 UTC,"That sure is jumping to a lot of assumptions. Game programming takes a lot of work. It takes a lot more work when it's one person doing it all. It's even more work when a system is remade multiple times.  I'm going to assume the engine was made from scratch as well, which is a LOT of work to create. None of this sounds outrageous. Cube World is a very well made game and that takes time to create.  Patrick Klepek is also known to have pretty good relationships with a lot of developers. I don't like Kotaku either but I do enjoy Patrick's work. He takes his job pretty seriously."
CubeWorld,3ct8vi,UndeadWaffles,2,Fri Jul 10 20:44:09 2015 UTC,"That sure is jumping to a lot of assumptions     It might help to say I'm a dev myself. I pump out about 4 games a year. Some are pretty big too, but mostly government contracts so I can't talk a lot about it. The development cycle is still essentially the same, the only difference is that I don't have to do marketing. Perhaps Wollay should be in my line of business, where keeping secrets is part of the job and not just about being a terrible dev. Some of the games I've made are also far more complex than something like CubeWorld. Think along the lines of simulators. I have some credibility to speak on the matter.       It's kind of ironic too, their trailer video was deceivingly and consciously engineered. They know how to market a game, because they've already done it. Now suddenly he's the quite person who doesn't like to talk about his project? Give me a break.    Game programming takes a lot of work.     I know that all too well. Taken that into account, he's still the slowest dev imaginable. It's a single feature.... 2 years.... c'mon, don't be naive here.    It takes a lot more work when it's one person doing it all.     Not really, the overhead comes when more people join a project.     It's even more work when a system is remade multiple times.     Of all the things he said this is probably my biggest gripe. You design a system before you code it, maybe you refactor it once, but you never start coding without having some clue on what it's going to become. If you then subsequently have to ""remake"" the entire system, that's already the point you're incompetent, let alone when it happens ""multiple times"". I have no idea what to think of this, he's either making it up to sounds like it accounts for all the lost time or he's really going for the worst developer in history award.   Cube World is a very well made game and that takes time to create.     Then be naive and wait another 5 years. I'm just giving you my educated opinion. It looks well made, that's why I'm angry. Clearly he's got skills, they both have. That's why my money is on either procrastination or just not giving a crap and running with the money.    Patrick Klepek is also known to have pretty good relationships with a lot of developers. I don't like Kotaku either but I do enjoy Patrick's work. He takes his job pretty seriously.     I honestly have nothing against Kotaku or Patrick Klepek and I apologize if it came off like that. My problem is 100% with wollay and his wife.     For someone who really requires that much ""perfection"" for basic features in an already existing game, he sure was able to quickly move into his new million dollar home that he was able to buy from all the sales he got from this game, no problem making decisions there. If he was honest with himself, he'd have given up already. Perhaps he's experiencing paralysis by analysis or fear of success or just being a purist, all in the spirit of really wanting to finish the game, it really doesn't matter anymore. He took money, already spend a nice chunk of it on a nice new home and he's not delivering, not even close. Nobody with any experience in this industry would put another penny on ever seeing this game released. At least not to the point where it even justifies a single year of waiting, let alone 2, let alone the many more to come, you'll see."
CubeWorld,3ct8vi,Dicethrower,2,Fri Jul 10 18:02:30 2015 UTC,"One thing bothers me. Some parts you make sense. Other parts though (like having multiple people being where ""overhead comes"") it sounds like you're BSing it. The whole ""government contracts so I can't talk a lot about it"" is so overused to create fake credibility without requiring giving an example because you simply can't (""I worked on a secret EA project that had a strict NDA"" or ""worked on a engineering contract for the military in the late 80's""). So I would like to ask for some specific examples of what you've done that weren't government related. I don't mean to use Ad Hominem, I'm just casting doubt on a detail that can greatly affect the legitimacy of your argument (that is to say, even if those contracts and games aren't real you could still have experience in software development in general. I don't know you, that's why I'm bringing it up). Now back to the actual argument. You also have to remember, he's working on atleast one other thing: Plasma, a vector graphic software which he uses for the game's HUD and other graphics. But let's still ignore that. Let's look at the larger scheme of things. In the 14-05-09 post on the website, he breaks down what all he wanted involved in making the quest system. First off he explains about how he wants the quest to have you travel great distances to complete objectives. The problem: The world is procedurally generated in chunks as the player travels through them, much like Minecraft's worlds. So creating the system he wanted to would require some great effort, as you'd essentially have to predict random generation in order to generate something random that works with the other random thing. Next thing he talks about is getting quests from NPCs, which he states that he's already come up with the system for it (good, we're in the process of writing the code). However, reading further on, we can see he's already starting to change his mind, taking out quest markers, making quests not rely on talking to an NPC to start it, etc. Next he talks about adding a quest log, nothing really fancy to say about that other than the way it updates is dependent on triggering quest-related actions. After that we get to something that could cause a road block: He wan't things deep, he wants different variations of quests/items/locations. Now if he thinks anything like me, he's going to want to come up with something other than the usual ""get <x> item,"" ""kill <x> amount of <y>,"" ""bring <x> amount of <y> to <z>"" and the like. That alone can take time. He's not just writing code, hes planning things, running them through his head to see if they work. While you could write thousands of lines of code in a few hours or less, planning a key component with a fool-proof structure takes time. Working with random things takes time. Anything that you want to make huge takes time. In the screencaps and video we see he has the general code for quests finished; That is, they can be given to the player and completed. What we don't know is if the ones he shows off are hard-coded or if they're truly generated (my money is on one or two of the ones shown are generated and the rest he just spawned in the appropriate NPC for it). And as an after thought to typing all this out, I neglected to mention the whole thing could be spaghetti code for all we know (it does run pretty poorly as far as optimization and memory management If I remember correctly). I'm not trying to defend Wollay. His PR is terrible, and honestly the current shape of the quest system from the last post should have been released, but we can't neglect to remember that in the end, he's one guy, and he's doing a lot more than pushing out lines of code. He's coming up with ideas, sorting those ideas, throwing away many of those ideas, and repeating the process until he get's exactly what he wants to make. Also I want to make it clear I don't normally browse Reddit, so any and all arguments you make that correct me and prove me wrong are probably not going to be seen for a while. I'm not running away or trying to ignore you, its just I legitimately didn't see it because I probably visit Reddit once a few months. Hell, sometimes I forget I have an account."
CubeWorld,3ct8vi,Spice002,3,Fri Jul 10 20:09:13 2015 UTC,"So I would like to ask for some specific examples of what you've done that weren't government related.     Sure, here. In short, it's a 'real-time' (think along the lines of months, not actually second-to-second) simulation of the north sea, used as a training tool for maritime spatial planners. There are almost 100 interactive layers that you can plan things on, from placing pipelines to oil platforms, to shipping routes, marine protected areas, windparks, electricity cables, telecom cables etc. We call it sim city at sea. On top of the planning there are a whole bunch of ecology layers for every major sea creature. These eat each other, move around, are affected by construction, noise from ships, etc.     The tool is currently used to train maritime spatial planners to realize the immense amount of data they have to take into mind for every decision they make, but there are plans to integrate real-life gathered data from the ocean to map an accurate representation of the sea in order to predict what effect certain construction might have on the ocean's ecology and to set a standard for how the ocean is 'planned' for every country, because as of right now not only is there no standard, some countries don't even consider maritime spatial planning as its own specialization. They just put the same people who design roads on land to design windparks out in the sea, when it's almost infinitely more complex.  That said, this is pretty much the only thing I think is worth mentioning that I've done that's not NDA protected. Most of the time I work on simple apps, but at least 3 times a year I work on projects of this scale. Not always for government, I'd say half of the big projects are for big marketing companies. For example, one project involved walking through a 3D space with an oculus with eye tracking to gather data for marketing.     As for the rest, I could write a whole rant but the fact still remains, even if you imagine something incredibly grand, layers of overarching gameplay on top of each other, it's hard to justify taking this long.   And yes, overhead only comes when more people join a project. Still, even if it takes 120% of the development time with 2 people, compared to 1, you can still do it in 60% of the time it would take for just 1 person. The point being though, it's not an argument to justify delay, quite the opposite. I'd much sooner believe the argument of over management to justify delay than ""he's the only dev"", as the first is what you see all the time in almost every company. In my company everyone works on their own project for exactly this reason. It's much more efficient for 4 people to work on 4 projects than to do 4 projects in sequence with a team."
CubeWorld,3ct8vi,Dicethrower,-1,Fri Jul 10 20:40:10 2015 UTC,"I think you'll be surprised how much is in this update. Plus Wollay tests so thoroughly there are essentially no bugs, which is unheard of. Upon initial release there were like 2 bug fixes that needed to be done, that's it."

CubeWorld,3ct8vi,UndeadWaffles,2,Sat Jul 11 01:35:26 2015 UTC,"Even then, as a game developer you should be informing people on what's going on or else people will lose interest in your game. The problem is that we don't know what's going on at all because he won't say anything on twitter/facebook/etc., making us think the game is just dead and he ran off. I'm a game developer myself, I can understand huge engine changes or additions taking quite a while, but a quest system? Breaking that down that's creating lists that keep current quest/available quest/finished quest, saving/loading that list, and anyone that gives a quest will check against these list to see if their quest is done/available. This isn't something that takes 23 months, even with several revisions."
CubeWorld,3ct8vi,chrisall76,-1,Sat Jul 11 00:11:07 2015 UTC,"Breaking that down that's creating lists that keep current quest/available quest/finished quest, saving/loading that list, and anyone that gives a quest will check against these list to see if their quest is done/available.   Um, lol. Great, you mapped out a very simple system that keeps track of quests. How is that the entire quest system? You don't sound like a game developer. It'd be like saying creating a multiplayer game is simple because all you have to do is keep a list of the connected players and don't let more players join if the server is full. What about actually creating the quests? What about all the new assets that may have to be created to supplement these quests? How do you even know how depthful the quest system is going to be? We're talking about random quests generated in a random world. If it's taking him a while to do, it's probably more complex than you're imagining. Apparently you're incapable of even comprehending the task beyond a simple tracking/log system."
CubeWorld,3ct8vi,vegeta897,2,Sat Jul 11 06:46:55 2015 UTC,"That's a bad analogy, as multiplayer is a system that would take quite a while, especially when you make it from scratch. When it comes to a quest system however, it is literally list and tracking if the quest is done. The quest itself has conditions that are checked and once those are true the quest is set to complete and gives you your reward. The only complex thing I can see here is the random quest/text generation (which Wollay seems to already know how to do, as seen in the quest video and from the NPCs in-game), and spawning the required places the quest needs (which again, Wollay knows how to do). You're over complicating it.   A quest system does break down to those simple things, anything added on top of it does not take 23 months. If you look back to the first video we got of the system, it was already functional in the sense of 'random quest generated in a random world.' So once he started revisioning, wouldn't you think it wouldn't take as long as last time he did it since he already understands the concept? From the article, it seems he's more having problems ""making randomly generated quests that are fun and non-repetitive."" So he understands how to make a quest system (and has gone through several revisions to try getting this goal), that's not the problem.   I'm fine with him taking his time with developing a game to make it perfect, but he should at least give a update on what he's working on once and a while. A tweet every month or so isn't that hard."
CubeWorld,3ct8vi,chrisall76,0,Sat Jul 11 16:05:43 2015 UTC,"That's a bad analogy, as multiplayer is a system that would take quite a while, especially when you make it from scratch.    Yes, good deduction, that was my point.   When it comes to a quest system however, it is literally list and tracking if the quest is done. The quest itself has conditions that are checked and once those are true the quest is set to complete and gives you your reward.   No, that is one very simple part of the system. You're also assuming that the quests are all completely binary.   The only complex thing I can see here is the random quest/text generation (which Wollay seems to already know how to do, as seen in the quest video and from the NPCs in-game), and spawning the required places the quest needs (which again, Wollay knows how to do). You're over complicating it.   You're completely brushing over the potential complexity. The video gives a glimpse, but it is not at all exhaustive, especially since he's iterated upon it since then. Game development does not hinge on what developers ""know how to do"". Knowing how you want to approach something isn't the same as being able to create a system that works well and is fun to play. He likely created several systems that ended up being not fun enough. I would be bored to tears by your quest system based on how stupidly simple it is. Are you expecting ""Kill X number of goblins"", or ""Collect Y number of berries""? Do you seriously think he's spending months creating something as simple as that?  I don't know why you think ""making randomly generated quests that are fun and non-repetitive"" is not part of the quest system. ""System"" doesn't mean the part that just tracks what quests are complete and what quests are given. It means the whole system. What you're describing would be the ""quest tracking system"" or something more specific.  You don't even have logic on your side, even if we ignore game dev knowledge. Are you forgetting that we're talking about a guy that created a multiplayer engine and game from scratch practically by himself? This isn't some Unity asset store noob. Now, why would you think a system that someone like Wollay has spent months creating would be as simple as you're imagining? He clearly knows how to make a game. How could you possibly think the quest system could be so simple if a developer who has proven himself to be highly capable is taking this long? Do you have a single plausible reason to give me?  I agree with you that he should be communicating more. But I don't really care because it doesn't make the game come out sooner."

CubeWorld,3c3paf,Mr_Zaroc,11,Thu Jul 9 21:19:51 2015 UTC,"No... No...  Sorry this is the problem with whats called ""betas in progress"" in general, and it's what separates the professionals from the amateurs.  A professional will do everything they can to make sure their product is up to standard and complete if they ever enter open beta, Early Access. Because they want to make games, have a name in the industry, it's their drive. They love feedback, succinctly communicate what they're doing (because they're busy) and the direction to when the product comes out, people appreciate the games and remember the creators. So it's something they can be proud of.  An amateur will enter open beta or Early Access and spend a suspiciously long time  on social medias talking about their game, hyping it up, say these ambitious ideas. Release a couple updates then suddenly vanish. They get bored and realise they've already made a lot of money. They weren't passionate about making games, they were passionate about selling games, and there is a big difference. They're amateurs.  Right now Wollay and Pixxie are incommunicado because that's exactly where they want to be. They had fun making cube world but it seems clear the passion died out and they already probably made more money then they were ever expecting. So, they left.  Do I resent them. Yes, to a degree. The minute you start selling a product, especially a work in progress you promise to complete, certain consumer responsibilities should be upheld.  The fact they opened up their own store to eliminate as many middle men as possible says that profit was on the mind. Also the thing was sold for $20, if 30,000 sold, he made over half a million. I'm pretty sure sales were over 50,000, it was a very popular news story game when the indie scene was starting up. And let's not forget this was straight after Minecraft and looks like it.  But the man has a soul, he closed the shop page on his website. I'm not sure my experience was worth $20, but I bear no ill will."
CubeWorld,3c3paf,DeadSenTerran,2,Sat Jul 4 19:44:21 2015 UTC,"I personally think you completely wrong. I don't think they were like ""Oooh, half a million, lets quit this game and run forever!""... Not at all, not one person on this earth would make a game out of love and passion for coding then once it gets huge quit and fly into the shadows. Personally i think they did get bored and just decided that since people were rushing them they quit. But honestly if theyre even alive (Which who knows if theyre dead or not..)  they have to be doing something to the game, even if its thinking of selling the game to a major company such as microsoft for millions..   pls..."
CubeWorld,3c3paf,WooshJ,3,Mon Jul 6 05:25:05 2015 UTC,"This happens ALL the time. You hear the success stories, and the only ones who care about under the radar indie games are indie game journalists and they won't slag them off because, surprise surprise, it's bad for business and networking.  Castle Story. Kickstarted $700k. Sold 180,000 units. Hasn't been updated for years. Reddit page looks familiar.  Yogventures! Kickstarted $500k. Canned. Pledges given steam key to another game...  Spacebase DF-9. Sold 180k units. Canned. But Tim Schaffer is an honorable man.  CLANG. Kickstarted 500k. No one knows anything about this at all. Nothing. The best trick the devil ever pulled...  Towns. Greenlight. 2 million in sales. Abandoned! Xavi Canal is literally a thief.  I don't know about you but half a million is a lot of money, that's more than 4 years worth for me, and quite frankly I'm implying that it was much much more. Cube World was a very publicized indie game. I think it was over a million or two.  Why must they be doing ""something"" to the game. What evidence is there to support this? If anything they're actively giving evidence to the contrary. The shop page has been closed for months. They not communicating (which is something you have to do, even if it's like ""We're going on holiday guys.""). Microsoft doesn't give a fuck about Cube World. They only cared about Minecraft because of an E3 presentation and all future developments of this incredibly popular title.  In other words, I'm saying: We were burned. Be careful. Work in Progresses are a dangerous area."

Maybe he got into some conflict with sarah or w/e, maybe a divorce, maybe even worse...

Even if he had to pay taxes on the millions of euros, he still has enough because it also came not at once, but in like a timespan of 3 months.  The Flow app is free, while cubeworld is 20€.  Flow dev might have got some 5c donations and something from his friends who do reddit, but that's something completely different moneystamp."
CubeWorld,3bis1f,toaste,2,Mon Jun 29 21:20:24 2015 UTC,"I'd check my other comment on this thread. I'm not necessarily making a direct comparison between the two devs, nor am I saying wollay will release an update much like the flow dev did. I'm more of making a point that there still is a chance of a potential update in the future because devs do not always have time to dedicate to creation and might hold off on a project for an extended time only to bounce back."
CubeWorld,3bis1f,marceronni,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:29:17 2015 UTC,"We may never get confirmation that Wollay has moved on, but I think part of the problem is accumulated vitriol from the community.  It's clear from last year's quests update that the last version of CubeWorld that was released is not the most current build available. But releasing updates means going back to the project and facing hundreds of angry customers."

I don't think Wollay has any kind of pattern in mind, like releasing an update on the anniversary of the last update or anything like that.  Next time we hear about the game it will probably be completely out of the blue.  I was expecting some news very soon after the emails to the Youtubers, and then I was vaguely expecting something for the anniversary of the game's last update, but now I think it will just be random."

I know the domain expires on September or something, http://whois.domaintools.com/picroma.com so really...unless Wollay has automatic renewal (the domain has clientRenewProhibited which means according to this http://www.freewebspace.net/forums/index.php?threads/what-does-this-mean.2193905/ Wollay needs to manually disable this and then he will be able to renew it) or something he would have to do it manually which means he must be working on it. I really doubt its completely abandoned, if you look at how the website was designed it seems as if they were future-proofing the site for any other possible upcoming games, they also have this 3D tool...however if they scrapped picroma entirely well then...yeah.  Apparently Wollay has these other domains http://reversewhois.domaintools.com/picroma-e.k. anyone guess what the ones with an s are?"

Instead of ""picking up the slack"" and being a dick to prove that, how about being the better person who tries to do good in the world instead of just cynically dashing on others?   He gave up on it after realizing it'd be too much effort and work, and again, why work on something that's only going to bring more attention and hate and everything else? Easier to just ignore it.   What's even more funny is that you have the exact same info the rest of us have in regards to Cube World's development, yet feel confident to claim that it is, with utter certainty, not being worked on (even though there is evidence directly opposing that conclusion). Not only that, but you take it a step farther and start making claims about Wollay's mindset and motives.  Expressing hope for future updates is entirely fair and reasonable; assuming some form of continued development has occurred is also entirely fair and reasonable (based on the blog posts and video updates). Whether that development will ever amount to anything released is obviously still up in the air.  You're not being realistic -- you're being extremely jaded. It is one thing to be skeptical about the future of Cube World and whether Wollay has progressed decently on it, but it is an entirely different thing to make resolute claims that he has abandoned the project (and then start making claims about his mental status/health)."

About still hanging around here, I'm still subscribed so that I will see any unlikely interesting news since I wasted spent my money on this game.    You can have your own opinion and beliefs of course, but if you still expect a lot to happen with cube world you do look more and more disconnected from reality to others."
CubeWorld,3ax0w5,lappro,-2,Thu Jun 25 02:12:02 2015 UTC,"Yo, it's only 360 days since last update... Look at the Facebook, while not a game update, we did get a progress update 30th of June 2014"

The last sign of life from Wollay may be more recent, but what is that worth if it doesn't result in an actual update?"
CubeWorld,3ax0w5,lappro,-1,Thu Jun 25 11:30:13 2015 UTC,"Are you seriously asking what a sign of life is worth?... A sign of life is the only thing that shows us there is even a slight possibility of an update. Also read my comment again, then your reply."
CubeWorld,3ax0w5,marceronni,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:13:02 2015 UTC,"It would be worth something if the signs of life were followed by an update,  but they aren't."
CubeWorld,3ax0w5,lappro,-1,Sat Jun 27 20:24:56 2015 UTC,"Calling it worthless is pathetic, calling it less valuable is reasonable, besides I just said we had an update less than a year ago, now 364 days, even if that didn't result in a game update, while you said the full 2 year of no game update showed we were never getting one, whereas only the last 364 (debatable) days of no life sign shows that we're getting nothing."

Alot of my adventures lately have been in snow biomes and lava biomes. I am noticing a lot on this list are from those places. Hang out there and you should find them!  Boss Monster: Troll - check Boss Monster: Dark Troll - uhm, maybe? Or maybe it was just dark out?  Boss Monster: Yeti - Yup Boss Monster: Cyclops - Several! Boss Monster: Saurian - Yes and Ive seen different types too, different dino markings Boss Monster: Mammoth Yes!  Boss Monster: Lich - Yeah it's freaky Boss Monster: Golem - Not sure on this one... Boss Monster: Ember Golem Yes Ive fought them! They don't drop a spirit cube as far as I know , and also the one I killed the other day with my 100+ WarriOrc only gave me 19 xp.  Meh!  But a loooong good fight.  Boss Monster: Snow Golem I think maybe? Boss Monster: Hell Demon ...Also I think so, I might have blocked this one out it was freaky.  Also I always stay on a grid pattern while playing, it is by far the most efficient way to find the things the get the loots. Cube on, believers    heh heh"
CubeWorld,3awvgl,CaptainFurler,-1,Sun Jun 28 21:24:55 2015 UTC,"they are not bosses, if they were bosses, they would pig bigger, pink shaded and they would drop spirits. Ember golems only drop coins and possibly gear, saurians are boss and also a lich but dark trolls and other golems are not yet in the game. Hope this helped!"

Wollay is such an antisocial  flake of a dev though, that it's impossible to know where the game is or will be. He is that detached from the world and only cares about working at his own pace, in his own comfort, in his own home."
CubeWorld,3arw5u,AfroToast43,9,Tue Jun 23 04:46:10 2015 UTC,"Well, it is totally unfinished, barely begun really.

CubeWorld,3arw5u,Tramd,2,Tue Jun 23 00:54:37 2015 UTC,"It is enjoyable in the short term. Don't get too attached, because we don't foresee anything happening. Occasionally I log in and just work on leveling my rouge, just making numbers go up really. Apart from that, the most fun I've had is just exploring- pick a direction, and just walk, keep walking, and occasionally take a snapshot of some beautiful scenery. Throw on some background music, and it just feels very relaxing.  Oh, do be careful with starting. The first 15ish levels are probably going to be pain incarnate as everything can and will gleefully stomp all over you."
CubeWorld,3arw5u,Aremnant,2,Sat Jun 27 17:36:35 2015 UTC,it's a game with a really good foundation. it's like reading naruto manga before it finished and instead of waiting a week per update you have to wait 2 or more fucking years for content.

CubeWorld,3ab4lc,CynicalCouch,3,Thu Jun 18 19:10:38 2015 UTC,"I've seen spirit cubes that were a lot bigger, and they didnt work for weapon application"
CubeWorld,3ab4lc,Skyrowind,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:12:46 2015 UTC,"all i could do with it was drop it, i couldnt put it on nor customize it.  are these special items in the game or something?"
CubeWorld,3ab4lc,imares,4,Thu Jun 18 19:14:58 2015 UTC,"I've never heard about anything like that before now, I bet it's just a bugged item or a glitch. I'd hang on to that shit for the novelty of it though"
CubeWorld,3ab4lc,tozkof,3,Thu Jun 18 19:18:16 2015 UTC,probably cheated in.
CubeWorld,3ab4lc,Parsleymagnet,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:26:09 2015 UTC,This was made last year by a PvP player named Omeruo.  It's just a wind spirit that she used Cheat Engine to put obsidian cubes on.  It doesn't affect its appearance when you put it on items; it's just a fun thing to drop on the servers and decorate things with basically. Source: have been part of the PvP community for a year and a half.

CubeWorld,3abjwc,Blubbll,2,Thu Jun 18 19:37:43 2015 UTC,"This game takes a lot on all three ends, processing, graphics, and memory. 4gb of memory seems to be the minimum to avoid world gen lag. I've always run it on 2gb vram no problem, but unless these are gaming laptops, they probably don't have dedicated graphics cards. That being said, the i5, for example, provides enough cpu and visual support to run the game exceedingly well. But honestly, most laptops won't be able to run it well. It is a very large game."

CubeWorld,3a8u3n,JacobThePianist,2,Fri Jun 19 18:27:02 2015 UTC,"Glad you like the community man, but I really would suggest branching out to find friends at school.. I just graduated from high school, and as someone close to your age, let me give you the advice that you need to find someone that you can have similar interests as.  Whether it be a guy or girl, someone your age or not in school, you need to find them.  Having a great friend will not only make school easier but it will help life flow easier :)  Maybe you guys can even play CubeWorld together?"

CubeWorld,3a6s94,NightmareX91,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:21:35 2015 UTC,"Shots fired. However, I can't blame you for your skepticism. I'm just disappointed to see that although we mentioned that we are still early in the development and we were trying to keep as much feedback as possible to suit the software to the demands of community, there was a lot of hate :(  Also, I haven't played Cube World for a long time, mind explaining what is and what happened to cubeworld4real?"
CubeWorld,3a6s94,NightmareX91,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:53:58 2015 UTC,"cubeworld4real also has a client with anticheat that also wgets stuff everytime you click their launcher, similar to your idea.  this is shit as he can put and run whatever he wants.  he also put a local cubeworld server and webserver on the victims pc. for forums he says.  just get cuwo and do everything server-side, cuwo already is strong enough! or get cuwo + mitm which would also support a vanilla server but lag like shit as atleast double of the packets get spammed between server and clients  have fun"
CubeWorld,3a6s94,NightmareX91,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:27:52 2015 UTC,"Difference between this and the anti-cheat thing is that this is actually rather easy to pull off. Create an executable that opens the Cube World launcher so you can log in, and once the Cube World process is found by this application, pick a random track in a folder to play. Of course, it won't be able to adjust music to battles, but it's one way of making the game feel not-so lifeless. If done properly, it could work easily on any other Windows version."

CubeWorld,3a6s94,SmileyVV,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:25:49 2015 UTC,A simple solution to the paranoia problem is to host your project on github so people can compile it themselves if they really want to be sure you're not stealing information.

CubeWorld,3a6s94,TLATER,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:23:30 2015 UTC,"legit as in  not batch?  not calling the cube.exe directly?  calling cubelauncher.exe?  being a standalone application that has two options  Run Cube.exe without music OR Run cube.,exe with music  OR run cubelauncher.exe without music AND run cubelauncher with music?"
CubeWorld,3a6s94,TLATER,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:31:39 2015 UTC,"Doesn't Cubelauncher.exe just close out after cube.exe launches?

CubeWorld,3a6s94,TLATER,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:38:35 2015 UTC,im calling the cube.exe directly to prevent users entering information.  on the other hand they could be concerned about a pseudo access to the stored information due to the lack of a login

He clearly spent a lot of time to get the game where it currently is (and has been for a while / ever), and people bought it because it was fun. It was only 20 dollars, and you can easily get your money's worth out of it. Legal action is extremely unessesary, unethical, and won't do anything to benefit the game.

CubeWorld,39wawa,Blubbll,6,Mon Jun 15 09:16:17 2015 UTC,I got it to work quite a while ago but it was so slow it was unusable. At that time I had to install full directx in wine to get it to work. I also had to manually install xaudio2 dlls. There may be a better way to do it. Look at what the crossover people did for it and you may be able to adapt their horrific xml .tie file to do it in regular wine.

CubeWorld,39s9ng,Pinkishu,12,Sun Jun 14 16:32:44 2015 UTC,Client changing is unneeded and only unnecessarily intrusive on the users. Just secure the server properly.

CubeWorld,39s9ng,Blubbll,5,Sun Jun 14 20:23:01 2015 UTC,"Never trust the client. Check stuff. If someone moves more quickly than they should, the server knows. If someone doesn't die when they should, the server knows, etc. How much damage is applied when A hits B the server knows too. So by having a good server-side cheat protection you don't need to stick intrusive software on people's PCs, which is likely cracked then anyway. If for some reason checking for speedhacks at runtime is too costly on performance, you can log some info now and then and let analysis of that info determine speedhackers. Stuff like that. There is no ""hack"" that a server cannot prevent really I think."

CubeWorld,39t6r3,ianandomylous,11,Sun Jun 14 15:11:45 2015 UTC,I do not own Trove however I can comment on some of its features.  Trove is a Multiplayer only Voxel based MMO. It looks similar to Cube World however many of its mechanics are different. Trove has a well funded development team who frequently deliver patches and updates.  Cube World is a Single and or Multiplayer RPG. It is voxel based and looks similar to Trove however many of the mechanics differ. It's development team isn't the greatest and the game hasn't received an update in 2 years.  The largest difference is Cube World is an RPG where as Trove is an MMO. Past the graphics they have a couple similarities however they are almost completely different.
CubeWorld,39t6r3,NoteTypical,10,Sun Jun 14 15:45:55 2015 UTC,"I did a comparison video a year ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzuDs3uKv2k  Trove has changed a LOT since then, as far as content, but the general game-play and ""feel"" hasn't.  In summary, Trove is built as an MMO, ie smallish, easily accessible adventure zones with loads of ""dungeons"" to exploit with plenty of other players running to and fro to group up with.  While CW (in its current form) is one long, endless solo or co-op journey with the occasional town or ""dungeon"" to explore.  Personally, I think they're very different play experiences and enjoy them both for their own merits."
CubeWorld,39t6r3,paulsoaresjr,2,Tue Jun 16 12:53:10 2015 UTC,"Are... Are you the real thing? Wow. Didn't expect you to still be on the lookout for this game.

CubeWorld,39t6r3,MaxiTornado,2,Tue Jun 16 22:46:33 2015 UTC,"Trove is very MMO focused, and definitely feels like one. CW feels like a single player RPG. Beyond that, I'm not much of a fan of MMO's, so I greatly prefer CW."
CubeWorld,39t6r3,Kep0a,3,Mon Jun 15 02:13:34 2015 UTC,I counter your argument with NEON NINJAS!

CubeWorld,39t6r3,Kep0a,2,Tue Jun 16 22:51:28 2015 UTC,"You haven't lived until you experienced mowing down robots, in data dojos, as a neon ninja."
CubeWorld,39t6r3,MaxiTornado,2,Tue Jun 16 22:53:25 2015 UTC,"Trove is pretty fun, at least for the first time around. There are ways it is better than Cube World (hint: one of those ways is that it actually fucking updates), but it also is not a perfect game by any means. Here is my general take on the pros and cons of Trove...  Pros of Trove:   In-depth building that includes a personalized 10x10 (or something like that) square that you can build whatever you want in (including a huge tower or underground base) and teleport with you in any new zone. You can also build in giant custom flat areas with your clan/guild. Building system also has blocks for music making, rail cars, and multiple styles of blocks that give an experience similar to Minecraft. Multiplayer, easy to find friends. Clan/Guild system that, again, allows you to have a personalized huge zone of your own to build freely on. Flying (Or rather, Gliding), boating, mounts, and rail car systems. Multiple different classes that are pretty simple functionally but offer great variety. Multiple areas that have different styles, including a candy biome, a futuristic tron-like biome, and more. While it has a cash shop, most if not all of anything gameplay related (including the alternate classes) can be earned by doing daily assignments and leveling up. Has an interesting gear system that encourages you to work harder if you want the absolute best (i.e, gear can have stars (*) near stats that increase your level past to level cap if maxed out). Most weapon skins, armor skins (hats/face), and dungeons are made by the community using voxel building programs. These skins are added periodically to the game every update.   Cons of Trove:   Not Cube World, and thus lacks the charm that Cube World has (or had). No real ""quest system"" to speak of. Leveling can feel extremely repetitive after awhile (you go to biomes and finish dungeons, which rewards XP per completed objective). By the end of your first maxed character, you'll probably be bored of the game unless you engage in creating things. Multiplayer interaction is scarce. You can group up with people and complete things and build things together, of course... and you start off in a central social hub that allows people to buy things and show off their building creations... but there is no PVP that I know of or fun activities/games to play, which becomes extremely obvious once you've maxed a character."

The fact that this subreddit is still active (both with believers and non-believers) is a testament to that."
CubeWorld,39t6r3,Chris1mmortal,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:02:35 2015 UTC,"To each their own. I played for about an hour and decided it wasn't worth playing yet. I've been waiting for the update ever since. I'm still subscribed because I believe that the game will be a truly good game once Wollay polishes it up a bit. Until then, I won't waste my first experiences on what it is now."
CubeWorld,39t6r3,ShadowWolf202,2,Mon Jun 15 00:30:04 2015 UTC,Fair enough.  I think when the game gets updated it will indeed make the current version look like crap.  I like the current version but I can see how people wouldn't; it kind of lacks direction and it starts off really slow and grindy.  I do think the game is beautiful in many ways which is one reason why it's hard to replace.

CubeWorld,3964gv,Shadewarp,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:48:37 2015 UTC,Which is also why it is so sad that the development has stalled :)
CubeWorld,3964gv,NoteTypical,6,Fri Jun 12 10:38:52 2015 UTC,Mage - High Damage Low Defence Range - Med Damage Med Defence Rouge - Med Damage Med Defence Warrior - Low Damage High Defence   You then  have the extra classes you can choose by pressing X.
CubeWorld,3964gv,Glassle,3,Tue Jun 9 17:00:59 2015 UTC,I'd say Rouge has more damage given the right specs.
CubeWorld,3964gv,TheAntiHick,16,Tue Jun 9 17:24:27 2015 UTC,Rouge  Rogue
CubeWorld,3964gv,Yin-Hei,2,Wed Jun 10 05:20:32 2015 UTC,ranger with the auto attack bug... combined with boomerang it's a lot of dps
CubeWorld,3964gv,Glassle,2,Tue Jun 9 17:05:01 2015 UTC,What autoattack bug?
CubeWorld,3964gv,Yin-Hei,2,Tue Jun 9 17:24:48 2015 UTC,press g after an auto and it refreshes the auto attack. usually use it with a glider but it can work with a boat. look it up
CubeWorld,3964gv,NotSoAccurateNo1,2,Tue Jun 9 19:14:55 2015 UTC,Warrior using a shield plays really well because your m2 attack holds your shield up (it has its own gauge) and you take hits to charge up then release m2 to destroy everything around you. Then immediately follow up with skill 1.
CubeWorld,3964gv,FabiotheTurtle,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:02:00 2015 UTC,"The block mechanic is ridiculous at times. If you couple it with dodging (while they can't be stunned), shielded warriors can almost take absolutely no damage from a fight. For more than 1 opponent, this is can get trickier, but the area of effect stuns work wonders.  I solo'd a Saurian at level 3."
CubeWorld,3964gv,kbob7878,5,Fri Jun 12 02:01:58 2015 UTC,Rouge is god
CubeWorld,3964gv,TheAntiHick,10,Tue Jun 9 16:20:37 2015 UTC,Rouge  Rogue

CubeWorld,3964gv,runelink678,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:58:15 2015 UTC,No doubt the rogue. If you go ninja spec there's a glitch that will give you a 100% crit rate.
CubeWorld,3964gv,Starkewe,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:07:05 2015 UTC,That's not a glitch
CubeWorld,3964gv,runelink678,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:36:50 2015 UTC,If I recall correctly it's supposed to give you 100% crit on your next M2 attack. But it winds up making every hit until you use your M2 crit.

CubeWorld,3964gv,frisch85,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:46:51 2015 UTC,"I'd also like to add if you can play a good rogue and you know the enemy attack patterns, there is no way you can lose because the rogue dodge makes you invulnerable. Rogue is most OP 1on1 combatant."
CubeWorld,3964gv,Lionsbane,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:54:10 2015 UTC,"I'm going to say the mages both water and fire, because of their different abilities from range.   The Fire Mage - very lethal from a distance and has a slight power lead over the water mage. Its explosion ability can knock enemies out in the area around them and using potions makes them just as versatile as the water mage.  The Water Mage - very powerful from a distance and has the ability to use a heal on yourself and other players.   Regardless I do still find myself playing as a warrior guardian from time to time, all the classes are fun up until you're past level 125 (IMO)"

CubeWorld,3957up,Cirlex,2,Tue Jun 9 14:01:42 2015 UTC,Fists will usually have a higher tempo so it is good if you're looking at DPS. Long swords are more for the critical hit factor.
CubeWorld,3957up,CynicalCouch,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:34:54 2015 UTC,"I personally never use the daggers on my rogue, I don't like the RMB attack. I choose longsword or fists based on which does better damage. They are both easy to time the RMB attack and take no damage."

CubeWorld,38whdr,Cookie-Smasher,8,Sun Jun 7 15:43:41 2015 UTC,"Housing is actually pretty old feature that didn't make it into the public build he released because the construction plans didn't drop from mobs nor did he add them to the shop. Back then the housing was where you had an overview of an area and could build on it from that view by dropping sections onto it, like you would drop a specific type of floor plan down then drop a doorway/stairs to get to it then some walls/windows and finally a roof on top. It wasn't ""block by block"" rather like, section by section, which there were different style of ""sections""(so you could have like, different looking windows and such) and they were suppose to have varying degrees in difficulty to find."

CubeWorld,38whdr,Quentin_Jones,7,Mon Jun 8 17:21:24 2015 UTC,"Well i am not one of the optimistic, but i am also not one of the pessimistic.  I see it the following way:  I have bought Cube World for a neat prize, admittedly for the hope of a more developed version.  However, i already played this game for around 40 to 50 hours simply exploring the world. So i have had already quite some fun for the money i payed. In fact the only thing that stops me from having further fun is that the game is a bit impossible when playing singleplayer (are there mods or can you perhabs tweak an .ini file that changes that? :-P ).  If one day there will actually an update i will have MORE fun with it.  That is not to say that the experience with Cube World didn't make me carefull with early access type deals. And i am still critical of the way Wollay communicates or rather doesn't communicate the development.  However (2 - the howevering) i am not agressive towards Wollay or this game or people that still enjoy it or hold out hope for a final version.   I mean, thanks to Steam i have around 180 games that i am actually interested in, not to counte my old backlog on consoles that reaches back all the way to the SNES (because as a grown up NOW i have the money to play what i couldn't as a child). There is simply no reason for me to get hung up on a few games because there are so many others that i will simply never will be able to play because my life is not endless and i have a (somewhat extendable) sociallife on top. X-P  Just wish someone could make a balancing mod for singleplayer till perhabs the final thing comes out.. or not. :-P"
CubeWorld,38whdr,Felixader,3,Mon Jun 8 17:47:36 2015 UTC,"I think you're pretty late to the party :P  Housing might be cool, depending on how it's done, but I feel like it might take away from the exploration aspect of the game. If you build a house, you don't want to just ditch it and then go explore - you'd want to stay there.  A cool idea would be to let you make tents, like the the tents from Harry Potter - the ones with the undetectable extension charm placed so they are bigger on the inside."
CubeWorld,38whdr,TheFinalPancake,2,Sun Jun 7 12:37:29 2015 UTC,That was my first thought however then I remembered Wollay saying (bare in mind it was Wollay who said this) something about easier fast travel between biomes. This would mean you could take a ride back home (possibly in an airship) every time you wished to return home. Equally though I do like your idea of tents. Tents in general make a lot of sense. Best bit is all the models already exist in the game.

CubeWorld,390ut0,silentnj,3,Mon Jun 8 13:19:31 2015 UTC,"Uh.  You clearly have no idea how procedurally generated stuff works.  None of this is taking any time to generate or randomize.

CubeWorld,390ut0,ColinStyles,-5,Mon Jun 8 16:36:53 2015 UTC,so basicly u are saying he made 10000000 seeds one by one ?. and that they werent we're not randomly generated even for once ?.

He has various things that based on conditions will say ""based on this random range, be this size, or this type, or this amount"".  Seeds just change the initial random number basically, there is nothing beyond making conditions for the random numbers to affect.  They generate dynamically, he doesn't have to create any seeds or anything like that.  Try it yourself, put in 12137210732173982173091263091620316319260 or anything else.

He designed the rules of the random generation, but that's a comparatively far easier task than manually constructing millions of worlds like it sounded like you were saying.  Procedural generation isn't actually that incredibly complex of a task nowadays is the main point to take away here."

CubeWorld,388610,Sowel,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:29:22 2015 UTC,I bought it today and it looks great (haven't downloaded it yet) but from what i've seen it looks a lot different than Cube World.

CubeWorld,388610,Lionsbane,2,Wed Jun 3 15:29:42 2015 UTC,"The engine looks super promising. The graphics and animations and physics and sound and movement all seem really really polished.

CubeWorld,388610,frisch85,2,Wed Jun 3 12:37:35 2015 UTC,"Personally, I won't accept other games that are ""like"" cube world. It's either cube world or Lego world (very big difference no matter how ya look at it.) This does look cool though. I just hope its not like the Lego batman or star wars or whatever... As neat as those games were, I won't give Lego more money for the same game with a different name.   Also you must consider, Minecraft characters will likely be in this game, as Lego Minecraft is a thing. So this will be Mine-Cube-Lego-Craft-World. (Hopefully.)"
CubeWorld,388610,frisch85,2,Tue Jun 2 20:21:26 2015 UTC,"Looks promising but at the current state it's pretty useless to release it. Features required to make this game a hit:   Crafting: Furniture, Weapons/Armor, Tools Farming Housing (currently only available via the Brick-by-Brick editor afaik) Loot from slain mobs Character Classes/Skills Enhanced mechanics (equal to MC Redstone and Switches) NPC Interaction (Shops)   Unless such features will be implemented, it will be a simple kids game, not complex enough to keep adults playing it. Without real RPG elements, why would you play this and not just MC?"

The conclusion tends to be that the only way to get the game is to download a pirated version. I personally do not support pirating games however in this case I would make an exception as long as you purchase the game as soon as it is available again. Plenty of guides on YouTube.  As for Why? Wollay, I do not know if you have noticed but he tends to do his own thing.

(I've always had a hard time getting into the game, but couldn't figure out why.)  Forgot to switch off my study music and I ended up playing the game for 4 hours straight.  The music made all the difference in me being able to immerse myself in the environment.  Spotify's ESM playlist fits perfectly with the exotic voxel landscape of the game!"
CubeWorld,3866vx,RyuEchelon,11,Tue Jun 2 03:22:39 2015 UTC,"The only thing the two have in common is a voxel engine. It's effectively a light-weight (and pretty) Dwarf Fortress, which is a great combination to bring the genre to the masses.  I've been a supporter of the Kickstarter since day one. Even now, two years later, it is a long way off from a finished game.  Progress has been consistent but slow. At the current of development, I'd say they are at least a year away from a finished product.  Given that the creators have hired at least 2 other people to help with the project, I can only assume they've run out of funding by now, or are close. But with the Steam early access around the corner; I doubt their funding issues, if they are having any, will last very long."
CubeWorld,3866vx,Zalamander,1 point,Tue Jun 2 05:14:47 2015 UTC,Sounds a little like banished.  Is it playable yet?
CubeWorld,3866vx,Mr_Zaroc,1 point,Tue Jun 2 05:36:49 2015 UTC,"By comparison to early versions of Alpha? Yeah. But it still has a few nasty bugs the rear their heads at times that pretty much end that particular game for you (like villagers going into idle mode and no longer doing tasks). Also, there are still a ton of features that are still missing from the game.  With the current alpha that was released a week or two ago, I started 4 separate settlements (games), so I would say that's playable; but it's still very much a sandbox game with no really narrative driving you forward. The game has actually started to feel like a game within the past couple of alpha releases. So that's progress.  Here's a video of the current build: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcOrwMqRFbU"
CubeWorld,3866vx,Zalamander,1 point,Tue Jun 2 06:27:44 2015 UTC,Looks amazing. I really tried to play dwarf fortress but it was too much. Everyone died of thirst despite my access to water and numerous barrels. I will definitely get this when it comes out.

CubeWorld,380ru4,BirdiePeeps,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:08:39 2015 UTC,I don't remember where I saw it but something about the armor not changing or not having enough armor choices when you equip items?
CubeWorld,380ru4,DexRogue,2,Sat Jun 6 23:19:09 2015 UTC,I don't remember where I saw it but something about the armor not changing or not having enough armor choices when you equip items   Hmm... the only thing I can think of is that when you wear a piece of armor it doesn't change visually on your character.  Appearance is controlled through outfits.
CubeWorld,380ru4,BirdiePeeps,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:48:07 2015 UTC,Yeah I think that was it! So that's intentional? I'm a big fan of putting on new gear and it changing your appearance.
CubeWorld,380ru4,DexRogue,2,Sun Jun 7 00:04:50 2015 UTC,"Somewhat subjective reasons and somewhat practicality.  From our own experience with MMOs, most combined gear usually ends up looking horrible and a lot of systems have moved to outfits to overwrite that, so we decided to just shoot strait for outfits.  The practicality reason is development time.  As a team of 1 1/2 people we sometimes have to draw the line to work on more important features.  The asset requirements for such a small addition is huge."
CubeWorld,380ru4,BirdiePeeps,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:18:27 2015 UTC,"Interesting, well it's nice to hear this from your perspective. I didn't know the development team was so small! I'm going to take a chance and pick it up so I hope you guys don't bail like Wollay did on Cube World.   Just a note, my eight year old daughter saw me looking at screen shots and said, ""Whoa, that looks really cool! I want to play."" next time it's on sale I'll have to pick up a second copy so we can play together."
CubeWorld,380ru4,DexRogue,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:05:55 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify, were are not Early Access or Beta, we released on the 22nd after being in EA for a little over a year.  Though we will still be supporting the game with balancing, bug fixing, and plan on adding an endless dungeon mode.  For the 3.5 years of work I've put into it I'm happy with our product and many people have had a lot of fun with it.  If it's not your cup of tea you have refund available.  Actually a few people have mentioned that they played it with their kids and had a lot of fun, and the Summer sale is right around the corner."
CubeWorld,380ru4,BirdiePeeps,3,Sun Jun 7 02:29:16 2015 UTC,"The only thing it has in common with Cube World is that it uses a voxel engine.  It's a mindless grinder hack-n-slash. The action can be fun, but there's no real strategy to fighting other than dodging and blocking.   The UI/Menus are terrible.   It' doesn't utilize it's own voxel engine very well outside of character/prop/item models; the world you run around in could easily be done in the Quake 1 engine.   The textures on the terrain are nice.   The static camera angle makes travel ""forward"" easy, but ""backwords"" if a wold of suproise and no-see-ums.  Even with it's fun elements, I grew tired of it within a few hours. I'm sure multiplayer can be fun, but the couple of games that I did join had huge level variance and the UI provided no real way to find the other players.  It feels like it's about 60% through development, but it's in ""released"" state. The dev is probably still updating, but it feels overpriced for what you get today."

CubeWorld,3829gl,j4ckxandxj1ll,2,Mon Jun 1 09:42:18 2015 UTC,"I have had problems fitting study with video games a lot during my life so generally I have developed a few different techniques for getting over it.  There are 2 different types of addiction, absolute and enjoyable. The difference being absolute is when you dream of the game, possibly even let your mind wonder on the topic whilst you should be doing far more important things. Enjoyable addiction is healthy and you shouldn't aim to get rid of it. Having that extra bonus to do well so when you get back to your PC you are feeling in a good mood to play a few games, is not a bad thing.  So you need to identify. From what you are saying you seem to be ""absolutely"" addicted. No matter whether it is affecting your life or not you need to take a break. Generally speaking lots of guides will tell you to ""cut down slowly"" or ""only play at fixed times of day"" (video game addiction is sounding more and more like alchoholism). The reality is you need to go cold turkey. Those characters you have need to go. You aren't having fun, what you think is fun is actually obsession and you will feel much better when it is gone. Once CubeWorld is deleted from your PC, feel free to download it at some point in the future. It is always good to playing an old game however when you return put measures into play to make sure you do only play it ""enjoyably"".  I hope I help and I am sure there will be an element of denial, you will say ""it's not that bad"" or ""perhaps my addiction is just enjoyable"" ultimately, delete CubeWorld, it seems harsh now but a couple months down the line you will thank yourself for it."

CubeWorld,37vgi6,laseht,5,Sat May 30 19:02:21 2015 UTC,"Might as well make it from scratch. A modding method was mentioned a few weeks ago, however, it would essentially be reverse engineering and in a the end starting from scratch with a codebase you are familiar with would be much easier.  TLDR: Not worth it, might as well start from scratch."
CubeWorld,37vgi6,thatrguynamedtrevor,-4,Sat May 30 19:06:05 2015 UTC,"I mean the game is pretty close to being at least in beta, comparing the modding to some MC mods, which I don't thing has API yet, probably would have been reverse engineered? I think it might be doable. At the very least I want this sub to turn from a hate sub to a proactive sub."
CubeWorld,37vgi6,Syberz,2,Sat May 30 19:30:57 2015 UTC,It's an immense pain in the arse due to the language used. Reverse engineering produces gibberish that is hard to decipher because it's naturally obfuscated.  Minecraft uses Java which is easy to reverse engineer and it's understandable once you do.
CubeWorld,37vgi6,Syberz,-3,Sat May 30 19:48:13 2015 UTC,"Damn. Could CW be more easily recreated in java (or at least comparatively to reverse engineering) or in some other language? Disregarding copyright issues and what not for now, and maybe major components like multiplayer. Edit: Fuck myself for asking questions right?"
CubeWorld,37vgi6,Svardskampe,2,Sat May 30 20:01:38 2015 UTC,"Making a game like this is not easy and it's time consuming, regardless of the language used. Start learning programming and see for yourself."
CubeWorld,37qn0l,boredkid07,9,Fri May 29 16:54:02 2015 UTC,I think he got fed to of people bitching about the update not being out after nearly 2 years
CubeWorld,37qn0l,AkariAkaza,3,Fri May 29 17:05:09 2015 UTC,"To be honest, he put it on himself if that's the case. People didn't bitch about about updates in the beginning, they started when he stopped doing them.  If he can't handle social media then he should just stay off it. It's very common for all kinds of developers to receive ""flavored"" feedback from passionate gamers, and that trend doesn't seem to stop any time soon."
CubeWorld,37qn0l,abdulzz,3,Fri May 29 23:51:32 2015 UTC,"I understand being frustrated - I know I couldn't handle people blowing up my social media and website with nothing but complaints for something I made - but why is he preventing more people from buying the game then?  At this point (a two years after an update?) people would be buying what has been made, not ""what might be"" made."
CubeWorld,37qn0l,Rivus,13,Fri May 29 17:30:50 2015 UTC,"Wollay just does everything ""his way"". He has his own vision for the game and doesn't want anybody to interfere, I respect that. It's just that other ""alphas"" have done things in other ways by at least updating players on what's going on. Last update about the current roadmap was a year ago.   When your website states that you plan on updating ""regularly"", people will understand that as some reasonable time. So the bitching is totally understandable."
CubeWorld,37qn0l,Cirlex,-1,Fri May 29 17:40:39 2015 UTC,I dont think its that.
CubeWorld,37qn0l,Jamesathan,6,Fri May 29 17:40:25 2015 UTC,"If he had launched a kick starter saying that if you pay £20 you would get the alpha and once the game was finished you would get an update to the game, nobody would have said anything.  Yet people be bitchin'"
CubeWorld,37qn0l,Jamesathan,4,Fri May 29 17:22:00 2015 UTC,But this is almost two years after an update. I'm not looking to buy the game cheap and hope for an update that makes my experience better; I just want to pay that price for what is done with the game now.  I can't imagine how frustrated the people who bought in early must be; but why take the shop down at this point?  That doesn't stop the people who bought the game from complaining.  That stops people who want to play the game that is made from purchasing it.
CubeWorld,37qn0l,ColinStyles,0,Fri May 29 17:36:04 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean man, but a lotta people have a warped perspective on what wollay done, is doing, and what he will do in the future.

CubeWorld,37qn0l,Wewius,2,Fri May 29 18:08:12 2015 UTC,"Because he's incredibly autistic.  Literally.  The guy cannot handle attention in any capacity whatsoever, and ran like his home was on fire when his game exploded with attention and hype.  Probably the dumbest thing you can do when developing software, hell, we had someone threaten gabe newell and still come out ahead of wollay."
CubeWorld,37qn0l,Perplexed_Comment,2,Mon Jun 1 20:33:57 2015 UTC,"Don't worry. Wollay didn't take the money and ran. He is still working on a big update but don't expect it to come soon. Because of some problems and the lack of updates for 2 years he choose to take down the option to buy the game but it will be possible again, once the update is done.  Lately there have been news and rumors about him getting close to release the big update but nothing 100% official. There are numerous emails made publicly and such, showing that he actually does live."
CubeWorld,37qn0l,EmotionalCrit,18,Fri May 29 17:05:57 2015 UTC,There have been news and rumours out about a big update for the past few years...
CubeWorld,37qn0l,Wewius,3,Fri May 29 17:11:19 2015 UTC,He took down the shop and the game is no longer available anywhere besides torrent sites.  I don't think he's updating the game.

CubeWorld,37fuvz,Mr_Zaroc,19,Wed May 27 09:27:54 2015 UTC,"Uhh, okay. This is a little bit complicated.  Your level increases your power, which is kind of like a strength value. For example, A character with a strength (power) value of 20 can't lift a sword with a weight (power) value of 30. And a sword with a power of 20 probably doesn't deal as much damage as a sword with a power of 30.  So;  Level determines your character's power  Your character's power determines what weapons your character can and cannot lift depending on the weapon's power.  The weapon's power determines it's damage.  Okay, now let me explain crits and tempo.  In every weapon and piece of armor, there is a hidden value, from 0 to 20. The higher this value is, the less in favor of crits and more in favor of tempo the item is. At 0, the item will give you a high crit rate, at 10 it is most balanced and at 20 it is most in favor of tempo - speed. Just as a side note, gold items are better suited for crits and silver items are better suited for tempo - a silver item with a hidden value of 0 will still have some tempo increases and far less crits than a gold item with a value of 0.  So;  A hidden value, from 0 to 20 determines crits and tempo.  0 is best for crits.  20 is best for tempo.  Gold seems to naturally have a high crit rate.  Silver seems to naturally have a high tempo."
CubeWorld,37fuvz,TheFinalPancake,2,Wed May 27 10:12:11 2015 UTC,"Ah ok, but that means that if use the same sword or whatever, the damage is the same, even if my character levels up"
CubeWorld,37fuvz,Cirlex,3,Wed May 27 10:33:17 2015 UTC,You only level up to be able to use better gear =)
CubeWorld,37fuvz,TheFinalPancake,2,Wed May 27 12:01:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah. All your level determines is your power and to some extent, your crit and tempo. Characters with high levels naturally have high crit rates and tempo's. (I think.)"

CubeWorld,37fuvz,j4ckxandxj1ll,4,Sat Jun 13 21:28:30 2015 UTC,"With the complexity, let me add some simplicity, it slightly increases your base damage. Slightly. Not noticeable enough that you can tell levels to levels, and by the time it WOULD be noticeable, you probably have a better weapon."

CubeWorld,374mc1,TheFinalPancake,5,Sun May 24 20:53:45 2015 UTC,Shhh stay strong. Pancak can't know just yet
CubeWorld,374mc1,mcape6,4,Sun May 24 21:57:59 2015 UTC,who whouldve known >;:D
CubeWorld,374mc1,iHaku,6,Mon May 25 06:48:08 2015 UTC,"No words from him that we know off. I'm gonna look hard for news and will post when I find something, so check the reddit often."
CubeWorld,374mc1,Cirlex,3,Sun May 24 21:13:25 2015 UTC,That small crumb didn't last long .....
CubeWorld,374mc1,Stormside59,0,Sun May 24 22:33:31 2015 UTC,Maybe its attracting some ducks and they are on there way here right now
CubeWorld,374mc1,Mr_Zaroc,2,Wed May 27 10:35:47 2015 UTC,Maybe someone could try donating or msg'ing to littlewood during his streams and ask?
CubeWorld,374mc1,Fuey500,-2,Mon May 25 20:05:24 2015 UTC,So what?
CubeWorld,374mc1,CakeMagic,0,Mon May 25 15:19:14 2015 UTC,I don't understand your question.
CubeWorld,374mc1,CakeMagic,4,Mon May 25 15:21:09 2015 UTC,"Your title said 'sooo', so I said so what?  Besides, for quite a few years already, Wollay has never even communicated publically even once. So it's expected that there won't be any words from Wollay. :P  People in this subreddit just got hyped for no reason, just because a guy from the Yogcast emailed Wollay. He just got the same kind of email response as everyone else that emailed Wollay."
CubeWorld,374mc1,CakeMagic,5,Mon May 25 16:13:14 2015 UTC,"The thing that makes this email different is that it was from the Yogscast. They were given exclusive access when Cube World was first released, so people assume they are going to be given access to the update before it is released."
CubeWorld,374mc1,Cirlex,6,Mon May 25 19:14:04 2015 UTC,The person only emailed Wolley once and got a reply. He also stated he knew as much as we did. People assume too much.
CubeWorld,374mc1,CakeMagic,1 point,Mon May 25 19:52:31 2015 UTC,what?
CubeWorld,374mc1,Cirlex,3,Mon May 25 20:21:24 2015 UTC,"Someone from Yogcast Tweeted that Wollay was alive, after he got an email response from him. Several users from /r/CubeWorld has done the same in the past.  The email that the Yogcast member got was very similar to what the Reddit users got. Additionally, it doesn't seem like the Yogcast member know much more than we do, since he did say something along the lines of 'I know as much as you guys do'.  No new info about Wollay or Cubeworld has come out ever since.  tl;dr people got hyped over a generic email response from Wollay"
CubeWorld,374mc1,Cirlex,2,Mon May 25 20:38:14 2015 UTC,"I understand what you mean. Martyn was the one who said that he knows as much as we do, but then he said after that he knows what the blurred line in the email says."
CubeWorld,374mc1,CakeMagic,1 point,Tue May 26 11:53:28 2015 UTC,"Also, martyn said that all he could say for now was that wollay is alive. Suggesting that martyn has more to say, but he can't/arent allowed yet."
CubeWorld,374mc1,CakeMagic,4,Tue May 26 12:13:22 2015 UTC,"I honestly believe people assume a bit too much. It could be just some private information that Wollay put in there, that was a bit too sensitive, so they blurred out.  It could be something he said not to share, because he might not stick with it. (for example planned update release date).  It could be completely unrelated lol.  Out of all the possible things that might be on the email and out of all the possible things that Martyn might know, people assume a bit too much. Having an open mind is good, but don't go in a position where you'll just end up being (more) disappointed. And potentially anyone else that follows with the hype."
CubeWorld,374mc1,Cirlex,-2,Tue May 26 12:41:09 2015 UTC,"The thing that makes this email different is that it was from the Yogscast. They were given exclusive access when Cube World was first released, so people assume they are going to be given access to the update before it is released."
CubeWorld,374mc1,_pin_,2,Mon May 25 21:03:14 2015 UTC,The email that the Yogcast member got was very similar to what the Reddit users got.  'I know as much as you guys do'  people assume
CubeWorld,374mc1,Cirlex,0,Mon May 25 21:40:47 2015 UTC,You're not listening to me at all. People think that the Yogscast will be given exclusive access to the update before it comes out. I didn't say the email was any different or that they knew anything more.
CubeWorld,374mc1,Martanz,1 point,Tue May 26 11:46:44 2015 UTC,Wollay has spoken publicaly many times?
CubeWorld,374mc1,CakeMagic,2,Mon May 25 17:27:23 2015 UTC,Recently?
CubeWorld,374mc1,Martanz,2,Mon May 25 18:10:26 2015 UTC,"last time he spoke publically was when he released the quest video, but he answers email regularly."
CubeWorld,374mc1,Cirlex,0,Mon May 25 19:52:30 2015 UTC,https://i.imgur.com/EwbftTB.png   Upcoming update
CubeWorld,374mc1,Martanz,2,Tue May 26 20:57:07 2015 UTC,"No time frame. It's no different than saying that he's 'still working on it'.  We don't know the pacing, we don't know his time frame. Knowing Wollay, it can take half a year."
CubeWorld,374mc1,Cirlex,0,Wed May 27 08:46:20 2015 UTC,I am aware of the pacing but I honestly believe that the there's two alternatives here.    Wollay releases an update within a reasonable time frame and major parts of the game finished.  He waits until the game is completed    I'm optimistic and hope for first one but nonetheless the game is being worked on. Which is what this subreddits discussions has been about for almost two years.
CubeWorld,374mc1,Minifig81,1 point,Wed May 27 11:53:38 2015 UTC,Wollay said in the email that this UPDATE will be a big step towards the full game.
CubeWorld,374mc1,xTaQoZx,0,Wed May 27 12:02:28 2015 UTC,That's true. I'm a little tried...  But my point is that we should still have faith in Wollays work
CubeWorld,374mc1,StitchScout,0,Wed May 27 12:09:45 2015 UTC,I agree with you that we should have faith in wollay.
CubeWorld,374mc1,thatrguynamedtrevor,0,Wed May 27 17:33:57 2015 UTC,3 years and it won't even be the full game AND no time frame? What the fuck.
CubeWorld,374mc1,Kimmykix,1 point,Thu May 28 03:12:57 2015 UTC,What the funck*
CubeWorld,374mc1,thatrguynamedtrevor,0,Thu May 28 11:03:42 2015 UTC,"dang, I wish there was an update to this game."
CubeWorld,374mc1,proxibomb,-67,Tue May 26 14:56:01 2015 UTC,Check for updates it released!
CubeWorld,3738kj,nukem2000,1 point,Sun May 24 13:32:05 2015 UTC,"Try changing the seed number. Inside your Cube World installation folder you should have ""server.cfg"". Open it with Notepad and change the number to something completely random. For example: 90210"
CubeWorld,3738kj,rhycon,1 point,Sun May 24 18:39:32 2015 UTC,"Tried already :( sadly the same thing, it generated the new world however still no spawns."
CubeWorld,3738kj,nhdemtre,2,Sun May 24 21:56:13 2015 UTC,"You could actually try emailing Wollay for help on it.  He doesn't bother to update his social media... or anything for that matter, but he does occasionally respond to emails.  I had an issue getting the game to launch a couple months ago and he responded within the day.  His email is: wollay@picroma.com"
CubeWorld,3738kj,ChrisRK,1 point,Mon May 25 05:20:04 2015 UTC,I had the same issue back when Cube World still was hot stuff. Still to this day I don't have a solution to it :/  It seems to be working on some computers but not on others.
CubeWorld,372edk,SeABeaF,17,Sun May 24 05:44:31 2015 UTC,Wow now we even got people complaining if there will be a  update.  And me complaining about the people complaining about an update.
CubeWorld,372edk,laderlappe02,3,Sun May 24 10:26:40 2015 UTC,"He didn't complain, he just said how hyped he was and that he was afraid university will be ruined. He was just honest."
CubeWorld,372edk,Cirlex,5,Sun May 24 10:52:52 2015 UTC,Woosh
CubeWorld,372edk,Dingus_Milo,4,Sun May 24 12:12:48 2015 UTC,"Why did this get so many down votes, it's the truth?  I ain't complaining, I want an update!!! Just it will be life ruining >_<"
CubeWorld,372edk,risemix,-9,Sun May 24 12:59:46 2015 UTC,"Because this subreddit isn't a personal blog space or your twitter account, I guess?"
CubeWorld,372edk,risemix,6,Sun May 24 13:43:33 2015 UTC,I just want to point out that there's not really a solid indication that there will even be an update.  We have a few sly nods from some e-celebrities and a few screenshots of e-mails with blurry text.  I think you guys need to relax.
CubeWorld,372edk,CakeMagic,3,Sun May 24 11:37:32 2015 UTC,"I love how the whole sub-reddit goes hyped when a third party person mentions Wolley being alive, despite not hearing a peep from Wolley himself and despite the fact that the Yogcast probably know about the same as we do, lol.  Either people will end up happy or hearts will be broken again and tears will be shed."
CubeWorld,372edk,kendall12321232,3,Sun May 24 16:35:15 2015 UTC,"14,112 to be exact"
CubeWorld,372edk,momocorpo,2,Sun May 24 05:48:24 2015 UTC,"If you really want your life to be ruined, you should try Trove, it's an Action-MMORPG, looks a lot like CubeWorld, with more content, more dungeon, more classes, more items and it's a F2P MMO.   As a bonus it is developped by a professional team on full time so always updated etc... (it is in BETA)"
CubeWorld,372edk,xCrabanx,1 point,Tue May 26 07:42:09 2015 UTC,Your Uni life seems saved. The game is no longer available for purchase and you can't register on the website anymore.

CubeWorld,36rkbl,CloudStorm3,-22,Thu May 21 18:23:30 2015 UTC,haters I guess.
CubeWorld,36rkbl,IJustWantComment,8,Thu May 21 18:28:59 2015 UTC,"Not everyone who downvotes is a hater, why does everyone keep saying that?"
CubeWorld,36rkbl,IJustWantComment,-34,Thu May 21 19:35:37 2015 UTC,Then you dont know the definition of hater.
CubeWorld,36rkbl,Gogkti,16,Thu May 21 20:46:39 2015 UTC,"They don't hate your video, they just dislike it."
CubeWorld,36rkbl,Mr_Olivar,-16,Thu May 21 21:12:47 2015 UTC,But whats the point of clicking the dislike button? What do they get from doing so? They do it simply to hurt the uploader. Im not hurt though.
CubeWorld,36rkbl,Gogkti,11,Fri May 22 06:41:54 2015 UTC,Maybe they don't like it
CubeWorld,36rkbl,ReverESP,-10,Fri May 22 11:56:26 2015 UTC,"If I think you are an asshole, Should I just say to you that you are one? No, Because that could offend you."
CubeWorld,36rkbl,superlizerd,4,Fri May 22 13:30:12 2015 UTC,"on youtube you're treated like my buddy who made something and showed it to me, you're a content creator who makes content, if people are not pleased by said content they review the content negatively, which in this case is done through a downvote button.  A better parallelle would be to say ""if i think a film/book/ is bad should i just say that it is bad?"" yes you should and i don't think you disagree with that."
CubeWorld,36rkbl,Zerocare,-1,Fri May 22 19:48:38 2015 UTC,"On youtube you can upload amature content. This was a video I made for fun, it's not intended to be high quality or good entertainment. I simply wanted to show off my vampire character flying around super fast because I thought It would be fun. I had no idea people would have so much against that. Sure, you might not like the video but should you dislike every video you dont like? No, I dont think so. I think you should just leave the video without doing nothing."
CubeWorld,36rkbl,Dashrider,7,Fri May 22 21:41:40 2015 UTC,"I don't really care if you are offended. If I don't like something you do, I'll tell you.  Maybe that's just the German attitude but I find it a lot better than sugar-coating everything and pretending to like shit"

CubeWorld,36rkbl,funtimerror,1 point,Fri May 22 14:12:49 2015 UTC,"If you record this video in a public server, you probably rose the server level, fucking all the players making them getting stupid ammounts of experience."

CubeWorld,36rkbl,TheFinalPancake,5,Fri May 22 18:24:26 2015 UTC,"I dont know either, it's so weird. Like what have I done. I dont care about the hate though, but I'm curious to why."

CubeWorld,36ssvp,Cirlex,1 point,Fri May 22 13:41:20 2015 UTC,I could also run a teamspeak server on the cwmaster server  Or i could rent one.  Setting up these always is a mess
CubeWorld,36p247,TehProdigy,2,Thu May 21 00:17:48 2015 UTC,I assume you have the server running on a seperate machine than you are playing on?  Because of the ping and stuff. If this should not be the cause I would recommend exactly this. Set the server up on a seperate machine
CubeWorld,36p247,Mr_Zaroc,1 point,Thu May 21 15:28:46 2015 UTC,does solo lag?
CubeWorld,36p247,superlizerd,1 point,Thu May 21 01:05:40 2015 UTC,Nope. It is definitely not frame lag.
CubeWorld,36p247,superlizerd,1 point,Thu May 21 02:35:33 2015 UTC,How do you host it?
CubeWorld,36p247,superlizerd,1 point,Thu May 21 02:39:44 2015 UTC,Port forward and server.exe
CubeWorld,36p247,superlizerd,1 point,Thu May 21 02:44:43 2015 UTC,Any custom. dll? Or an external launcher?

CubeWorld,36nihl,ReverESP,2,Wed May 20 17:58:25 2015 UTC,Run the cube.exe in the cube world folder. That will skip the login. If that's your problem.

CubeWorld,36ioii,DotaLoveless,2,Tue May 19 18:12:49 2015 UTC,Haha same. It's probably impossible.

CubeWorld,36ioii,Enlicx,11,Tue May 19 20:53:52 2015 UTC,"It's the same as code breaking or translating an unknown language. Here we know it's english, so you look at how many letters are in each word based on the font, then guess at words constantly until you reach a point where it is the process of elimination. We already know where each word ends and begins, so it is a lot easier than you might think. Higher black is taller letters, lower is hanging letters, etc. Match similar blurs to identify letters which speeds up the process considerably.  No, I am not going to do it, just explaining how it would be done."
CubeWorld,36ioii,mezzoEmrys,3,Tue May 19 21:32:54 2015 UTC,It's actually even less guesswork if you have the right tools. I read an article somewhere about an automated process that would blur test letters/words in the given font/size until it matched the pattern.  Edit: I think it was this: https://dheera.net/projects/blur
CubeWorld,36ioii,vegeta897,4,Wed May 20 03:20:14 2015 UTC,I wonder if someone here is not-lazy enough to do that.
CubeWorld,36ioii,lucw,1 point,Tue May 19 21:45:36 2015 UTC,Hey....  Nah in all honesty it could be something personal which is probably why it was blurred.

CubeWorld,36ioii,AtWorkButOnTheReddit,1 point,Tue May 19 23:57:10 2015 UTC,"Blurring is a destructive algorithm, so it can't really be ""undone"" with pure math. What you can do however is use a program to try blurring words from a dictionary until the result matches the image.  Edit: Apparently it can be undone with a clean enough sample."
CubeWorld,36ioii,AtWorkButOnTheReddit,4,Wed May 20 03:23:30 2015 UTC,"If someone has a lot of time on their hands, they can try using a program called SmartDeblur and analyzing each letter to try and determine the words there."

CubeWorld,36ghii,frisch85,1 point,Tue May 19 06:12:46 2015 UTC,"We already got fast traveling, though its a bit hard to find them first. Maybe a map you can buy which shows you some portals. Riding flying pets would be pretty overpowered I think. Maybe you need a high enough level to get or you need to finish a quest which is a pain in the ass. I really like the other points"
CubeWorld,36ghii,Mr_Zaroc,4,Tue May 19 06:28:56 2015 UTC,"The distance between portals are just to far. Would take you 1+ hours to move from one portal to another right now.  Flying pets would have an exhaust system, similar to when you are using the glider."

Because you would need to discover them regardless. And if there are more portals there wouldnt bee enough quests. A portal in the city center would be handy"
CubeWorld,36ghii,Mr_Zaroc,3,Tue May 19 12:46:20 2015 UTC,"Well yeah it's a good thing, problem is you will never know where the portals are because they are random. Friends and i have like 50+ hours in the game and we never found a portal... Maybe just mark it on the map once it is in range, that could be enough."
CubeWorld,36ghii,frisch85,1 point,Tue May 19 12:54:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah it can be really hard to find some, but if you follow the grid lines I think I found at least 2 per country, most of them are in a cluster, meaning if you found one another one cant be far away. But its not really handy if they are only 2 Quests away. I think there should be at least an item which shows you where one portal could be, for the right money"
CubeWorld,36ghii,Mr_Zaroc,1 point,Tue May 19 13:04:33 2015 UTC,"I don't like the idea of flying mounts.  People often complained that when flying mounts got added to WoW, the game really lost something.  And I fully agree.  I would much rather be forced to walk / ride along with my friends and take our time and enjoy the sights.  Nobody wants to spend too much time simply getting from place to place, but if you speed it up too much the game quickly gets stale.  We have hang gliding and ground mounts (and if you play ranger, bouncing across the land ;) ) and I think those get you from place to place quickly enough.  Everything else, I fully agree.  Good list!"
CubeWorld,36ghii,Chris1mmortal,8,Wed May 20 00:53:43 2015 UTC,"I think building a house would kind of take away from the adventure aspect of the game. After you spend so much time building a house, you wouldn't want to leave it, would you? There are only two ways I see this working:    You can teleport back to your house at any time or from any portal You can pick it up and carry it with you, like the magic tents from Harry Potter."
CubeWorld,36ghii,TheFinalPancake,5,Tue May 19 17:26:57 2015 UTC,The teleport seems the most practical. It's already been seen that he was working on house-building; it's only a matter of when and how it's implemented.
CubeWorld,36ghii,Mr_Zaroc,5,Tue May 19 23:37:27 2015 UTC,Not sure if I really want to see somethimg like op mentionend. I would be totally ok if he would fix the money system. It is way to easy to get money and you cant really do anything with it. There should be some shop which sells rare items or formulas which are incredible hard to pay for.
CubeWorld,36ghii,Cirlex,2,Tue May 19 06:24:25 2015 UTC,Yeah an economic overhaul would be a great addition; prices maybe adjusted by the biome and city types.
CubeWorld,36ghii,SmileyVV,6,Tue May 19 06:52:42 2015 UTC,The thing I want the most is advanced skill system.
CubeWorld,36ghii,altiris28048,3,Tue May 19 06:34:44 2015 UTC,Ambient music would be nice. House building system along with a way to display your trophy weapons. Meaningful fast travel. Smaller biomes (and more) or more towns. Questing obviously. More advanced skill trees.
CubeWorld,36ghii,Syberz,5,Tue May 19 07:35:25 2015 UTC,"Better weapon customizing  Homes  Furnished dungeons (doesn't really make it immersive atm)  Seasons (required to wear certain gear in extreme conditions or maybe certain weather/seasons change your attacks and a type of gear restores it, idk)  Ability to destroy more things!  If its true they were working on a mac port I would like a linux port also!"
CubeWorld,36ghii,Neamow,3,Wed May 20 00:45:51 2015 UTC,"I don't really want home building, I'd prefer a focus on questing and exploration.  I'd be happy if we could just buy pre-built homes and furniture to put in them."

CubeWorld,36ghii,Chris1mmortal,2,Tue May 19 09:21:41 2015 UTC,"PIRATE SHIPS AND PIRATE BATTLES of course, I could see this being rather difficult, making it to where characters can maintain footing on a moving ship would be difficult, especially if there is a disparity in internet connection on servers  More populated towns, maybe two towns per Biome. Like one big city and one smallish town withouth a class trainer or less shops.  A camp system, you can pitch a tent and your own fire place, set that as your spawn point."
CubeWorld,36ghii,Chris1mmortal,2,Tue May 19 14:15:20 2015 UTC,I'd like to see an expansion of the voxel-based weapon customization system.  I love the way you can upgrade your weapons in a way that is visible to other players.  I hope it gets some more depth.
CubeWorld,36ghii,fartyshoes,1 point,Wed May 20 00:55:36 2015 UTC,Oh yeah dude same; one of the best aspects of the current game if you ask me. I just loved adding like 20 extra blocks to make my longsword look like a foot longer LOL.
CubeWorld,36ghii,Razoul05,2,Wed May 20 02:54:04 2015 UTC,"My favorite thing was that you could give your weapon a kind of enchantment with those spirit cubes.  The way it is right now though 1. sharing those boss drops with friends is annoying and 2. the way they're power restricted can make it hard to get a solidly upgraded weapon while also finding new, better weapons on the ground."
CubeWorld,36ghii,scanevaro,1 point,Wed May 20 03:14:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah; balance is still a pretty big issue in the current version. I certainly hope to see a mixture where it's equally viable to both use new weapons as well as upgrade favorite ones. Possibly making it so that body items (Wood, metal, stone blocks) are relatively minor and cosmetic; while gems could be more rare and useful."
CubeWorld,36ghii,TechnoSharkMC,1 point,Wed May 20 03:30:27 2015 UTC,Player housing would be pretty cool.
CubeWorld,36ghii,NightmareX91,3,Tue May 19 06:29:27 2015 UTC,Probably not minecraft-esque minutia; but maybe a more simplified sims-like building system would work nicely.

However, after being majorly hyped from your tweet, seeing that this email is what prompted it is somewhat of a let down.  There have been plenty of fans that have emailed wolley over the past year, and have gotten similar responses from him.  And honestly, after a year or so of Cube World news coming via screenshots of fans emails, and nothing coming from picroma or his twitter or ANY official source... it's becoming harder to keep the faith.  And I want to believe! I hope that the blurred lines in your email was news that the update is about to drop. Or better yet, a screen shot that shows any kind of progress being made on this game.

CubeWorld,36dggq,AfroToast43,2,Tue May 19 17:54:35 2015 UTC,A realistic question that you can answer: Is wollay depressed about the progress of the game? He seems like he's in a writer's block right now and unable to move forward.

CubeWorld,36dggq,Rayneworks,2,Mon May 18 15:03:04 2015 UTC,"while it doesn't seem like something wollay would do, its possible. Wollay might know a lot of people are upset with the way he works, so he might want to build up hype again."

The questing system is going to be quite complex."
CubeWorld,36dggq,Sendoria,1 point,Mon May 18 17:46:39 2015 UTC,I'm hype as hell but just sad it's been forever since an update.
CubeWorld,36dggq,TLATER,0,Wed May 20 00:30:12 2015 UTC,Funny how the two replies to what you replied ot are:   Like they did when the game was in closed alpha.   and   while it doesn't seem like something wollay would do...
CubeWorld,36dggq,Sendoria,18,Mon May 18 19:04:38 2015 UTC,cautiously optimistic.
CubeWorld,36dggq,drdominic,26,Mon May 18 18:33:12 2015 UTC,"I watched inthelittlewood's stream, and I asked him ""Do you know what Dave meant with ""wollay lives"" ?. I also asked if he will get early access to the new update. His answer was something like this: I do know what Dave meant actually, he sent my a dm afterwards. Let's just say that wollay is alive. That's all im gonna say for now. The answer to my last question: That might come true."
CubeWorld,36dggq,u_ok,5,Mon May 18 17:39:00 2015 UTC,"Will have to find the vod of that, do you know rougly at what time you asked?"

From what I see (with my completely uninformed view) it's just some random guy who isn't Wollay saying ""Wollay Lives"" on his twitter.  What is the significance here?"
CubeWorld,36dggq,captainpalms,12,Mon May 18 15:40:09 2015 UTC,"He's from the Yogscast, a team of YouTubers who also play games before they get publically released, even Alpha versions. It was the case of Cube World, they played it weeks before anybody else could"
CubeWorld,36dggq,lappro,3,Mon May 18 15:56:37 2015 UTC,The update might not be finished. Maybe wollay wants them to test it and build hype while he is polishing the update. idk.

Opinions on whether the speculations are true or not aside, what do you guys think?  Is it just a coincidence, or is there maybe a correlation between the youtubers and streamers all of a sudden bringing up Wollay and CW again?"
CubeWorld,36dggq,altiris28048,2,Mon May 18 21:12:47 2015 UTC,"I think paul made the video because he saw so much stuff going on on reddit, and maybe got a bit exited."

CubeWorld,36dggq,Thyrial,2,Tue May 19 23:11:32 2015 UTC,"Why are people so hyped about this? Past experiences only showed that Wollay doesn't deliver and doesn't care about the consumers. He even couldn't announce being alive on his own. Actually having to announce you are alive as a dev is a bad thing.  It is good that there is hope, but he isn't suddenly a good dev for just announcing things. So far his announcements weren't worth anything to say the least. At minimum we should require Wollay to show results before rewarding him with praise. He let us down and in order to gain (atleast my) trust again he has to more than make up for it.    It is still possible he just ran out of money he earned with his first promise and is trying to earn more with new promises. Looking at the past it isn't too unlikely and only time will tell if there will be any results this time."
CubeWorld,36dggq,Jamesathan,4,Mon May 18 21:08:12 2015 UTC,"""Why are people so hyped about this?"" Because it's a amazing game, and this update looks very promising. At least from the video he showed us. I do not agree with what you're saying, but im not gonna waste my time arguing."

CubeWorld,36dggq,1UPBOB,-1,Tue May 19 15:17:59 2015 UTC,"There isn't even promised anything this time besides him being ""alive"" whatever that is supposed to get us. The video is also nearly a year old by now. The odds are not in our favor."
CubeWorld,36dggq,Jamesathan,1 point,Tue May 19 15:20:26 2015 UTC,"I guess you meant proven instead of promised? Because wollay has kinda promised a update. Even if the video is a year old, the content of the video is still the same. He has worked on the game, and i'm pretty sure he still do. (but, I cant prove it 100%)."
CubeWorld,36dggq,centagon,1 point,Tue May 19 15:58:02 2015 UTC,"Promised as in this news doesn't promise anything. The promise from the video still stands of course, but what is that worth after all this time?"

CubeWorld,36dggq,norapeformethankyou,-1,Tue May 19 16:11:45 2015 UTC,"Well. Doesn't really matter any more if he releases the update or not, I lost all my faith in wollay as a game developer."
CubeWorld,36dggq,Jamesathan,3,Tue May 19 16:33:10 2015 UTC,Doesn't matter TO YOU if he releases the update or not   I'm still excited. I am fairly sure this game will still gather a large amount of interest if/when he does release an update.
CubeWorld,36dggq,norapeformethankyou,3,Tue May 19 06:35:58 2015 UTC,Exactly. This is my personal opinion. I still think this game has a lot of potential it's just that wollay has a long way to go in my book until I'm gonna trust him again. Hopefully one day this game will be something.
CubeWorld,36dggq,Jamesathan,-3,Tue May 19 07:11:49 2015 UTC,What makes you not trust him?
CubeWorld,36dggq,norapeformethankyou,2,Tue May 19 07:21:14 2015 UTC,Personally I felt like he took a the money and ran away when so many people backed him up and counted on him. For me that's not a trustworthy game dev.
CubeWorld,36dggq,Jamesathan,1 point,Tue May 19 13:09:20 2015 UTC,I think it was more of a case of he was pressured into releasing his game before he wanted to. Cube World was always meant to be something he was doing on the side and he would have gone quiet and worked on more updates in his own time regardless of it it was a success or not. I do understand why people lost hope in him because when they buy a game they expect it to be a finished product or become finished at some point in the future but Wollay is definitely a perfectionist (Seen by how long Cube World has been in development and the fact that the only other person he trusts to work on the game is his wife). I think if all the news that is coming out at the moment is true and it all happens then Wollay will have redeemed himself in my eyes.
CubeWorld,36dggq,norapeformethankyou,1 point,Tue May 19 18:28:27 2015 UTC,"Great news, I listened to the stream someone linked and ....I was annoyed at the answer but fuck it, its better than nothing."

CubeWorld,36dggq,norapeformethankyou,17,Tue May 19 03:38:37 2015 UTC,haha. They kinda had a reason to though.
CubeWorld,36dggq,nuinbot,7,Mon May 18 20:59:48 2015 UTC,"Kinda. But in the same way they had a choice to leave or flame, I have the choice to behave like an adult, and behave in a way where I say fuck you to the haters.   We both made those choices, and both are wrong choices. But for today, just for now. I'm going to enjoy this wrong choice I have made. And tomorrow I will shut up."
CubeWorld,36dggq,Dingus_Milo,8,Mon May 18 21:02:38 2015 UTC,"Is it necessary to be a dick about this?  Besides, you mentioned his 2 year absence like we were supposed to take it in faith that he undoubtedly would come around and start updating the game again. I think 99% of the community realized that Wollay had gotten bored with the game and ditched it.   And yes, in a sense, the game is dead. Maybe an upcoming update will revitalize it, but I'm not holding my breath."
CubeWorld,36dggq,nuinbot,1 point,Mon May 18 21:32:10 2015 UTC,His point wasn't that we should have just had faith that it would be updated but that there was no reason to be assholes about it like a massive part of the community was. Was I upset when updates didn't appear? Sure but I didn't jump on here and scream about it because even in it's current state the game provided me plenty of play time for what I paid for it.
CubeWorld,36dggq,nuinbot,-1,Mon May 18 21:20:36 2015 UTC,"It is 100% needed to be a dick about. You know the feeling when, you were right from the start, and then you get proof that you were right? Yeah, its that feeling. It feels pretty great. Imma be a dick for today, and then tomorrow wait until we get further proof and then behave like an adult. I'm enjoying this way too much :D"

People play skyrim without mods mate. But then again, skyrim was a FINISHED GAME, before people started modding it.  A better comparison would have been minecraft, but that was stupid successful and you cant compare it to anything."

They turn to mods to enhance their game and make them play more in ways they couldn't before.   Lets get the full version of this (or at least a beta) before we start asking modding it okay?

So if it isn't dead it makes sense that two people programming something that complex takes some time. They either want it to actually be functional, or it's dead."
CubeWorld,3695sk,QuantumAssassin45,3,Sun May 17 13:10:32 2015 UTC,"Its called resource management, they wanted to make something good, thats great fine by me if they have big dreams and hopes.  They decided when their game was booming with hype to not hire anymore assistance to try and grow into a small indie team. Instead they decided to keep it a small self worked on hobby game.  Horrible decision after getting thousands of people to buy into the dream and expecting our support to help the game grow faster and better with our money, instead it got pocketed for personal use and the games development died for 2+years?  Personally this just demonstrates at how kickstarter/financial support for game developement can be abused. People want to donate and help fund these dreams expecting it to be used to help further the growth of the game, they expect more to be able to be done, and quality improvement. Neither was shown here, infact its quite possible the opposite has happened."
CubeWorld,3695sk,Soul_Collector,0,Mon May 18 22:31:16 2015 UTC,"It doesn't take this long. Reality is people were milked for funds that did not support the development. Sorry guys, you did not buy the game to support anything. You just bought the game. It will be released when it's released, that's it. He wasn't looked for help to get the game going. He just released and charged for it to sell you something he might get around to finishing. This is isn't his dream project, dude has a day job."

It's pretty clear that he wants to do this by himself.   Secondly, if you read the post that's still on the front page then you'll know why we haven't seen any updates from Wollay. It's nothing new that he posts some progress and then goes away for a really long time. He did this before the alpha release and probably won't stop.

CubeWorld,364s0o,TheFinalPancake,1 point,Sat May 16 17:59:13 2015 UTC,"What are you stuck with? I'm not really sure what else there is to it :L   Open CWME, then click File in the top left corner, then scroll down to Insert. A window comes up and asks you to choose a file (It has to be named as whatever you want it to be installed over - elf_foot, squid_body etc.). Find the custom file you want to install and select open. Then it will ask you if you want to overwrite the old file, select yes. And then open Cube World using the .exe - the launcher will detect something wrong with the file and redownload it."

It simply proxies and serves content from your site via their own servers to offer a better experience globally (if it's possible, i.e. if files aren't too big, or the wrong type).  I would bet that new builds will be stored somewhere completely different. Not on their website's web-server, but perhaps rather in some private repository of their development builds. When they're ""done"" and ready to make a release, they'll probably then upload the release version to their web server.

The known GUIDs are:  cffec13f-069d-4632-a39f-a9500846fcd2 for the initial 20130702 'CubeSetup.exe' release (which was up for less than 2 hours, the files are still on 'cwupdate' on aws) This release had extremely buggy/finicky DRM which would sometimes always fail on people's machines; it checked the file modified date as well as the computer's primary NIC MAC address plus the hdd volume data. It also, unlike all the later releases, encrypted 'resource1.dat' (a font file) for DRM rather than using db.dat.  f9d7d159-4e4d-484c-aa1c-48f3ad7416f7 for the 20130703 'CubeSetup2.exe' initial release; this used 'cwpatch' for downloading update files, and the game files have been removed from 'cwpatch' on aws, as far as I can tell. This release fixes the DRM issues of the initial release by using db.dat and only signing primary hard disk volume data.  472ae852-0935-49db-a274-848b9412dea0 for the 20130705 'CubeSetup2 launcher update only' release (files are removed from 'cwpatch' but are still on 'cwtest' on aws); this release fixed the 'hold O to restore mana' exploit.)  3d73ad5c-5efd-4684-ac1f-9f7f763f430c for the 20130705 'CubeSetup3.exe' release (which only differs from the 472ae852-0935-49db-a274-848b9412dea0 above in that the launcher looks in 'cwdownload' instead of 'cwpatch', no other files changed)  03f9ccc1-dd75-40ee-b0cc-25693661da70 for the 20130723  'CubeSetup3 launcher update only' release which fixes the crossbow spam and glider retreat ""bugs"" and changes inn reset logic so it only works at certain times."

If so, god only knows what their GUIDs are/were. Without the GUIDs it is impossible to retrieve the files.  A few notable fixes from these old updates are a bug which allowed riding any pet even non-ridable ones (such as the monkey); the world generator being changed so you cannot start in a jungle biome (the starting biome is fixed at the 'summer' biome); these old updates returned a world gen revision value of '2' (possibly until after the starting biome change), while all the final release ones used a value of '3'"

CubeWorld,35doav,Cirlex,63,Sat May 9 08:56:54 2015 UTC,"I've seen the religious give up sooner than Cube World believers. Anyway, I'll try to give a constructive argument. As a professional myself (as in, I make money making games, because clearly I'm not very professional about it), I've never seen a developer so indifferent to his own work, so unspoken about it, so unrevealing, so uncommitted. Which would all be fine, if the speed at which he worked wasn't so slow.     Almost 2 years without an update is not the way to go. Even if he's planning on releasing a full game when it's done, you want people to test it for you. QA is expensive and it takes a lot of time. Blizzard easily spend a year QA-ing, tweaking and repeating Starcraft 2 before it was even close to release. It was so important that after a year they decided to redo a good chunk of it. It's important. A big part of crowd funding is that you have a crowd that can, and want to, help you with your game, so put them on QA and update your new development into the existing game and watch the bug report flood in. It's just stupid not to use them.    Perhaps he's still working on it, slowly, in his way and/or his vision. I can relate to that, but it's just not practical. You do that with hobby projects that deep down you know won't really go anywhere. However CW is a proven concept, it makes money, tons of it. You'll want to invest all your time and money into producing this idea, but clearly he hasn't. To me Wollay has given up on CW like many developers do on their hobby projects. ""I'll finish that someday, but I just can't find the time/energy/motivation/<other excuse> right now to do it, maybe next weekend."""

CubeWorld,35doav,ColinStyles,21,Sat May 9 13:35:14 2015 UTC,Yup.  Evidence everywhere else is showing the opposite of the original post.  This game is one of the main reasons I do not support early access titles anymore.  One out of every 10 developers handles it right.  One out of every ten developers takes the money and is never heard from again.  The other 8 are riding the grey area in between.
CubeWorld,35doav,RickDripps,0,Sat May 9 18:46:27 2015 UTC,Fuck it man I dont regret buying the alpha of a dead game. i got a good 40+ hours out of this game with my friends and thats more than i get with most $60 AAA games.
CubeWorld,35doav,jschip,0,Fri May 15 05:55:52 2015 UTC,Those numbers are pretty similar for traditionally developed titles.  The main difference is that we never hear from the ones that don't make it.
CubeWorld,35doav,DanjalVeskandar,3,Mon May 11 02:00:11 2015 UTC,The main difference is that consumers dont get lied to/stolen from.
CubeWorld,35doav,Kslik,0,Mon May 11 05:38:21 2015 UTC,"Nobody got lied to or stolen from in the case of Cube World.  What we were promised was an alpha build opf Cube World and we got just that. An alpha build that I may add was considered by many to be far MORE than what anyone should expect from an alpha build in the first place.  More importantly a game that was by all accounts quite enjoyable and filled with content. Sure, most people expected updates even frequent updates. But we were never promised those. The game got some updates, after which Wollay obtained the information (and funds) he needed to continue development. Which is what he did.  And while it is true that everyone that paid for the alpha would also get the 'finished title' without extra costs. Nowhere was a date or details provided on that. We bought an alpha plain and simple - which is what we got."
CubeWorld,35doav,DanjalVeskandar,3,Tue Jun 16 14:59:39 2015 UTC,"We were promised regular updates, instead we got a year of silence and two years with no updates  . Wollay just took the money and left the community in the dark, do you seriously mean thats not scamming?"
CubeWorld,35doav,Kslik,0,Wed Jun 17 06:26:36 2015 UTC,"I seriously mean that the situation is more complex than that. I am also aware that the terms and conditions under which Cube World was provided are nebulous at best.  We were promised and delivered an alpha version of the game Cube World - which we got. And we were promised that all subsequent updates would be provided free of charge - which they were.  While I agree that this long stretch of silence would seem to indicate that he has stopped working on it. I'm also well aware of the legal status in that he never defined a specific number of updates or a timeframe. And while I would think it is a shame if Cube World is indeed abandoned as many assume. At the same time I'm all too aware that Cube World in its current status delivers FAR MORE content than some other titles have which are ""active"" in mere technicality of the term providing the occasional tidbit update but not really progressing in any direction.      To put things into context. I believe that Peter Molyneux scammed people in setting out to create a PC-focused godgame that would not be dumbed down in favour of its mobile component. Followed by delivering, not JUST a mobile exclusive focused free-to-play title. But a broken and incomplete one at that.  When putting that against Cube World and Wollay - yea... Thats not scamming. Scamming implies malicious intent, something that I would not attribute to Wollay and Cube World."
CubeWorld,35doav,DanjalVeskandar,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:32:36 2015 UTC,"This is basically how I look at it. I think he had planned on finishing it, but other things (aka life) came up and he cut back on working on this hobby project more and more, until he finally just set it aside. I'll be pleasantly surprised if it ever does get released, but I gave up on it long ago."
CubeWorld,35doav,ZakMckrack3n,1 point,Sat May 9 13:44:47 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this.  He has to be blind if he isn't noticing that this silence is harming his business. Which means that either: 1 - He does not care. 2 - He cares, but he has other reasons to stay silent. (Insecurities, fear of backlash or even that he simply knows he doesn't need to become the next Minecraft to stay afloat.) 3 - He really doesn't realize the repercussions.  It seems unlikely that he is actively working on this still given the lack of response. But its not impossible. Its possible that he simply doesn't know how to interact with the crowd and therefor simply chooses not to untill he has solid results to do the talking for him.

CubeWorld,35doav,DrVolzak,26,Sat May 9 17:15:34 2015 UTC,doesn't it say on the homepage that we should expect regular updates? <.<
CubeWorld,35doav,farbtopf,22,Sat May 9 11:58:42 2015 UTC,"The updates are regular.  ""recurring at uniform intervals.""  Uniformly long."
CubeWorld,35doav,TheFinalPancake,0,Sat May 9 12:29:56 2015 UTC,"You should look up uniform and/or regular.   Never mind I did it for you: uniform means that it stays the same... which it doesn't, obviously."
CubeWorld,35doav,palindromereverser,2,Sat May 9 21:50:53 2015 UTC,Refer to point 2.
CubeWorld,35doav,TheFinalPancake,-6,Sat May 9 21:54:57 2015 UTC,... Exactly. That's the meaning I meant.
CubeWorld,35doav,palindromereverser,2,Sun May 10 09:28:08 2015 UTC,I was showing you that I had already looked up the definition of 'regular'.
CubeWorld,35doav,TheFinalPancake,4,Sun May 10 12:57:18 2015 UTC,Its a pretty safe bet that almost a year of radio silence and almost twice as long without actual content updates make it hard to claim that the game is still in development.  It is only natural that an ongoing development should push out some form of updates. Even if its merely a blogpost or such stating the current progress and other state of affairs. Radio silence is a very bad thing when you're trying to sell something. And its going to be hard to overcome that bad rep once he DOES release.
CubeWorld,35doav,DanjalVeskandar,0,Mon May 11 01:46:33 2015 UTC,"Well, Fez sold well, right?"
CubeWorld,35doav,FlameOnYou,2,Fri May 15 16:02:36 2015 UTC,And Fez obviously was launched as an alpha title aswell... Not at all released as a completed title.
CubeWorld,35doav,DanjalVeskandar,0,Tue Jun 16 15:01:20 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter, point is that the radio silence with Fez is about the same as the radio silence with Cube World, in that we haven't heard something for almost 2 years now."
CubeWorld,35doav,FlameOnYou,2,Fri Jun 19 19:11:27 2015 UTC,"Seriously? You are comparing a FINISHED title with an alpha project and somehow expect that the creator of Fez is obligated to provide a sequel or other content?  Thats... Wow... Sorry... I'm speechless at your comprehension of how business works. Apparently the modern consumerist mentality has made it so ""It sold well."" means ""Make countless sequels!""?"
CubeWorld,35doav,DanjalVeskandar,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:34:56 2015 UTC,"But we didn't know Fez was going to be finished during the radio silence. I'm not saying I know for sure this is gonna be finished or that it'll sell well. I'm just saying that a long radio silence is no guarantee for bad sales. In fact, the chance that Cube World is going to be finished is bigger than the chance of Fez being finished then, because we already have an early build. We didn't have such a thing with Fez.  Also, what the FUCK is up with the random insults? I'm only trying to have a normal fucking conversation, and suddenly you're belittling ME because you can't even get your own story straight. We live in weird times where someone has to insult someone else to feel better about ourselves"
CubeWorld,35doav,FlameOnYou,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:28:43 2015 UTC,Take your comparison to Fez and set it alongside the average Cube World post. People are hounding Wollay constantly because they're not getting what they expected.  Give the guy a break. Even if he'd never update you still got more game for your money than the average AAA-title and I don't see anyone complaining about those.  Get those panties untwisted and let the guy work. Maybe he'll never update... Maybe he's stuck with anxiety attacks because thousands of people are pelting anything ranging from questions to death threats at him.  He clearly never expected the game to go viral the way it did. And unlike Notch he didn't decide to found a company and upscale his development. He probably had his own reasons for doing so...
CubeWorld,35doav,DanjalVeskandar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:19:00 2015 UTC,"Don't assume I have been asking the dev to finish this game. I never did. In fact, you're misconstruing all my answers so badly, you actually think I'm hostile. Well guess what? Because of your posts, now I am. I ask you one thing. To fucking read my posts. I will not respond to any further answer, but I do want you to realize that you've been so accustomed to online shouting competitions that you don't even know how to do anything else.  Peace out."
CubeWorld,35doav,FlameOnYou,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:21:48 2015 UTC,"Right, comparing Cube World and Wollay to Fez and its infamous developer Phil Fish wasn't suggestive or hostile in the least...  You may want to read your own posts to consider the implications of what you are saying. Not just the context in which you intended them to be read. Not everyone is gonna come to your conclusion given the surrounding context..."
CubeWorld,35doav,DanjalVeskandar,-7,Sat Jul 18 12:05:25 2015 UTC,"Think of it like the game isn't released yet. There is an alpha, but its not the real thing. After the release, you should expect constant updates."
CubeWorld,35doav,DanjalVeskandar,4,Sat May 9 13:14:22 2015 UTC,"The nature of developing a game goes hand in hand with having to provide updates.  For most of the public, this has always been a moot point as they aren't involved in funding a game. But you can bet on it that internally, regular status updates are provided to the ""superiors"" above a game development team to ensure that the money is well spent.  With the coming of crowdfunding and similar monetization and funding methods, that responsibility has in part shifted to reporting to the public aswell. So rather than 1~2+ years of radio silence while developing, getting updates out is important.  Cube World/Wollay is in a tricky spot since he technically did not crowdfund, but sold an alpha copy. Making it harder to pinpoint what his 'responsibilities' are. Though still, one could argue that morally he is required to atleast semi-regularly throw out progress updates or atleast some sign of life (as its stands it looks like he literally dropped off the face of the earth 10 months ago).  From a business perspective however. He also is required to push out updates. And when I say updates, I don't necessarily mean game updates. Progress updates like the one he did about the quest system are included. But Wollay isn't the most skilled at communication, he's a developer not a PR guy or community manager. That does not change the fact that almost a year of silence and almost 2 years of no game updates isn't gonna bite him in the ass once he does release.  And this silence IS hurting his product."
CubeWorld,35doav,Lionsbane,1 point,Mon May 11 01:53:30 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, what challenges do you face being an indie that you might not have before?  Wollay: With the increased popularity of indie games, there’s probably more public attention on a single developer and thus more pressure. Apart from that, I’m still a newbie in that area.    You're 100% right, he says it right here. So respect that and hush up about it."

CubeWorld,35doav,DanjalVeskandar,1 point,Wed Jun 10 09:07:30 2015 UTC,"By all standards Wollay is effectively one of those victims given what he's getting flung at him. But lets not make any assumptions on how he's dealing with it...  ""No news is good news."" isn't always the case and he may well have cracked under the pressure. We simply don't know."
CubeWorld,35doav,marceronni,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:02:27 2015 UTC,"True but people often attempt to retaliate when trying to cope with cyberbullying, Wollay isn't retaliating. If he's mature enough not to attempt retaliation, he's probably also mature enough to ignore the raging keyboardwarrior mob. But hey, that's just my two cents."
CubeWorld,35doav,DanjalVeskandar,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:28:27 2015 UTC,"Either that or he has collapsed under the pressure.  Right now, we don't know his current state or whereabouts. I agree with you in concept, I disagree with the practice as things rarely are as cleancut."
CubeWorld,35doav,Jaspaaar,-1,Wed Jun 24 23:36:33 2015 UTC,"I like your theory, it's interesting, and it's probably the best post we've had here in a while, but the website talks about the alpha, then says regular updates in the next sentence, which leads me to believe that he isn't talking about post-release. If Wollay was never planning to update the alpha, I'd have expected him to tell us that, instead of selling us a product which would have ""Regular updates,"" If it is true, he's been really misleading and deceitful."
CubeWorld,35doav,CynicalCouch,12,Sat May 9 13:28:12 2015 UTC,"This is probably the most organized I've seen a ""pro-wollay"" post. A lot of things to consider with your statement too, like how the alpha he has already made for sale, is just a kick starter with a playable version of the game. Really in that case he should have said this was a a pre-order deal, with a free demo though."
CubeWorld,35doav,MonsterLuna,6,Sat May 9 13:53:43 2015 UTC,"Don't know how people can latch onto one old interview, and ignore all the other conflicting evidence. If this was his plan why wouldn't he just say so?"
CubeWorld,35doav,Chronotakular,4,Sat May 9 23:33:59 2015 UTC,"This doesn't surprise me, but I find like, the lack of Wollay's public announcements concerning."
CubeWorld,35doav,Felixader,2,Sat May 9 09:32:54 2015 UTC,"I think the ONE mistake he did was taking money.   People (and by that i mean emotionally healthy/adult people, because lets face it SOMEONE always gets offended) would have been sad after playing a demo and then not hearing from it for years. But it wouldn't had invited all this negativity that is bound to happen the moment you ask for money and then have this kind of problem in comunicating."
CubeWorld,35doav,Neamow,5,Thu May 14 12:39:47 2015 UTC,"All right. I was actually thinking this was the case. I'm more mad about his constant lack of communication. No updates on the web page, nothing on Twitter, nothing to let fans of his game know what the hell is happening. That is the worst thing."
CubeWorld,35doav,norapeformethankyou,-1,Sat May 9 09:02:20 2015 UTC,"He does reply to emails though, got one myself. He also seems to only show us stuff when he has something to show. He is probably working on something.. Idk."
CubeWorld,35doav,Sendoria,2,Sat May 9 09:04:21 2015 UTC,Emails are easy to fake.  I think this was a hobby that got put on the back burner.  Like my costume desk I've been planning for a couple years...  Drawing and redrawing but never finishing it.

Here, you can see the list of adventure features, as we know the next thing on the list will be quests. http://i.gyazo.com/3a8134b28ae5ff8b968b6f4ec4c6a839.png  here are the world features. http://gyazo.com/0c256037f404161b5d8ada49b50f86bf And what new biomes will be in the next update? yes, Savannah and undead lands.  On supported plattforms sections, the next thing on the list is mac support. Suggesting it might come in the beta.  The next thing on Class Features is advanced skill threes, wich wollay has said he will be working on next."
CubeWorld,35doav,HollisFenner,2,Sat May 9 14:01:29 2015 UTC,"I think he has already posted a screenshot at some point showing off undead lands, so that supports this theory.  Thanks for a well thought out post!  It gives me hope.  Honestly, I can kind of understand why he is doing it this way.  I'm a student working on my own little game project, and my old game design teacher asked me to send him a prototype.  That was months ago, and I told him I just had to get a few things ready and I'd send him one.  But I kept putting it off because I wanted to finish this and then fix that and while I'm at it I can pretty quickly add another thing or it won't feel complete.  Suddenly I've told my old teacher to just hold on until it's nearly done >.<  edit: here's the post where he shows that he is working on those biomes: https://picroma.com/blog/post/12  To me this is a pretty compelling case for your argument.  It's pretty clear that he did create those biomes!  They're not photoshopped!  If he wasn't planning to eventually release the finished game, why would he waste his time developing these things?"
CubeWorld,35doav,Stormside59,2,Sun May 10 16:11:34 2015 UTC,"The Hunter X Hunter Manga releases chapters more often than updates on this game.... and that's saying something.  Sad tho that he doesn't have the decency to even say ""piss off"" on twitter."

CubeWorld,35doav,RoyalReality,1 point,Sun May 10 01:30:17 2015 UTC,"""Also, why would he work on a huge quest update without releasing it? He has clearly done a lot of work on it, from the video he released. There's no reason for him not to update it.""  Road to hell and good intentions and all that. He may well have intended to do just that, but if reality got in the way and he financially became unable to continue to support it - then he would've been forced to drop the matter. Now we already know that he's not the most communicative of people, so its not THAT farfetched to think that he'd rather just fade away and be forgotten than to open himself up to the disaster that an official announcement of ""Sorry guys, can't pull it off!"" would mean.  That said, I'm not saying this is the case. They're working on it with few people involved so the costs are pretty low and he did sell a LOT of copies.  The main question that then remains is, why isn't he sending out any word? As you say, ""Why would he not release the quest update after putting so much work into it?"" The question of why does he maintain radio silence is equally valid. This is doing harm to his name and would inevitably hurt his sales once he DOES release. The game would have to be ""done"", because very few people would buy Cube World at this point on the promise of later updates given his communication skills. And given the fact that neither he nor his wife seem very skilled in the communications department, why did he not reach out and either hire someone or got a semi-competent member of the community to function as his channel instead? The occasional update on progression or such, it wouldn't take much of his time either.  And that right there is one of the big pitfalls of startup developers getting into games. (And any other industry for that matter, but lets keep it to games.) Just knowing how to do 'one thing' is not going to get you there. Knowing how to do the financial side and what legal aspects to keep into account. Managing the PR/community side, overall business aspects and countless more elements come knocking that a ""programmer"" or ""graphical artist"" may not be knowledgeable of.  In Wollay's case, communication is most definitely his biggest downfall. Having the game no longer be able for purchase and such a long period of radio silence is definitely not doing much for his situation."

I used to watch Wollay's youtube videos about the games development over time. The first video he posted was on June 9, 2011, almost 4 years ago. The game looks very different in that video compared to the alpha version. So if anything Wollay just might be finishing up... that's me guessing that it only takes 2 ENTIRE years to make the game, since it only took that long to get the Alpha out."
CubeWorld,35doav,Stormside59,1 point,Sat May 9 13:44:11 2015 UTC,"For instance, the alpha has 6 biomes, only 4 biomes remain. And 3/4 combat features is implemented. 6/8 pet features is implemented. 11/15 monster features are implemented. 6/10 item features and 4/7 multiplayer features.

I guess this means that he's now working on releasing the beta version. The beta version will have a very complex quest system, with a lot of variation. Confirmed Beta features: Complex quest system. Two new biomes. 5 new creatures. New dungeons. New Villages. Smaller biomes. Maximum power is 20 instead of 100. Each land has a power level. An Arena. + some more minor things.

He's said several times that he doesn't want anyone else on the project, although I believe his sister(?) wife does art. He developed the game for something like three years before the alpha release, and only did the alpha because people begged him. Wollay works on an obscenely long-term planning cycle."

CubeWorld,34tmrq,CallumCarmicheal,8,Mon May 4 13:41:31 2015 UTC,Very interesting premise. Just read the article because I had never heard of this before. Would you be using the EXE or DLL method?
CubeWorld,34tmrq,thatrguynamedtrevor,6,Mon May 4 14:43:55 2015 UTC,"The DLL method, it would mean the mods can be placed outside the app and properly inside a folder, im hoping to do something like forge, but it would require 3000% more effort, forge was written using java and the code for minecraft was available this would need to call a custom dll which is the api and the dll would run the operation then convert it into assembly to call the methods inside assembly, its 100% possible but a hard process to make.  You would get the ASM/Assembly Mem-offset from the exe and inject our dll and then call the method from the dll.  It seems quite promising, but the hard part would be calling back into assembly, c++ offers a way to directly call assembly but it would be quite tricky.  Assembly inside c++ : Code Project Tut on using ASM inside C/C++ (this is what the api would use)  Side Note: I'm going to start decompiling Cube World into Callable functions tomorrow and ill stick up a github page for those curious."
CubeWorld,34tmrq,thatrguynamedtrevor,6,Mon May 4 18:28:41 2015 UTC,"Maybe advertising this on /r/gamedev or a modding community would make for of an impact. This is more a consumer used sub reddit. This does have potential, however, and I could see it progress with a good team of devs."

Your effort aside, you do know that reverse engineering is kind of illegal right?  Anyways, if you can do this, me and a lot of other people would be grateful, tho i am not gonna put my hopes up to high. C++ is tricky to decompile and enabling an API that allows to create mods using assembler code would be horrible. Or are you planning to develope a translater that, for example, converts lua into functional assembler code?  Oh boy i remember back in tech school when we learned assembler... so bad... those massive lines of code just to make a stupid LED blink lol."

CubeWorld,34xdjl,Jamesathan,0,Tue May 5 20:49:19 2015 UTC,"No, you were saying how the game was dead. It is not dead, it is being worked on, this is all the proof you need to disprove your comment. Its being worked on, that is final.  The game will be updated when it is ready, you see on the frontpage, the big ""No"" post? That is what tells the user if the game is regularly updated or near update or whatever. Its straight factual evidence and you can direct them to there rather than blatantly post your opinion all over the facts to try and lead astray the dude.  That being said, sorry if I was rude. This is a very touchy subreddit, we've been through a lot, and I mean a lot, of trolls and impatient kids. I've been waiting like 4 years for the game to be done and I'll wait another 4."
CubeWorld,34xdjl,CougsMcGoogs,2,Tue May 5 21:46:54 2015 UTC,"it might as well be dead to the community with how little info and updates are given about the progress of the game.. and i think youre taking the word ""dead"" a little to serious though. i used it in a simile to get across the point of this games absence of content and updates.Which again is not a statement of opinion.. the game has not been updated in nearly 2 years.. Not that that should be news to anyone. You're better off sticking your head in the dirt and hope to hear of a Cube World update rather than waste your time worrying over the development of the game. And Wollay just saying that hes working on the game is no ""proof"".. screenshots of updates and overhauls are proof of progress. Last any picture was posted was a year ago and that was about Quests. And hes still working on Quests as per what he says. Not saying its not being worked on.. but actual evidence and updates are ""proof"" that the game is being worked on.. As of now there is no ""proof"" that Cube World has made any progress within the past year."

That's a stupid and extremist point that does not have much relevance, but it does show that people are capable to believe without solid proof. If you have been following wollay for as long as I have you will know that he takes a long time to update. I'm happy to wait as long as it takes, I get on with my life, and check back every few days or so to see progress. I'd like those visits to be short, however people like you always need to go around with your ""opinions"", that just have to be shared and I for one love an argument. So to this I say, the game is not dead. Stop replying, if you don't have something supportive to say, then sit and wait with the rest of us or leave. You don't have to be here remember.

CubeWorld,34wdvc,Lovewell,14,Tue May 5 02:43:08 2015 UTC,"He put up a store and charged about $20 iirc. That price alone is making a statement that is was a serious project. The site also mentioned regular updates. During the time you could purchase the game he was active on social media. The game has a large amount of subtle detail that is inconsistent with a quick cash grab from the minecraft bandwagon. He has posted about updates while the store has been down.   All this leaves me with the conclusion that at the time he sold the alpha he intended to have a much more regular release schedule leading to a complete game, and that he could not meet or manage that. I believe he took the store down because he couldn't meet that expectation, and I doubt we will see it back up until he believes he can."
CubeWorld,34wdvc,MonsterLuna,2,Tue May 5 03:04:59 2015 UTC,"The one thing that led me to believe it went from ""hobby"" to ""cash grab"" was how adamant he was about NOT RELEASING OR ALLOWING ANYONE TO BUY THE GAME UNTIL IT WAS DONE.  Than he got a huge response and suddenly he changed his mindset completely and now no one has heard from him. Not hard to hop on twitter and say ""Don't worry guys still working on the game just really busy""."

The cry babies who cant get over the fact they spent 20 dollars for a game that was better developed than the shit on steams workshop only popped up awhile after there were no updates, but its only in alpha and its only his hobby, it will stay that way probably all the way up until release."
CubeWorld,34wdvc,Alkein,1 point,Wed May 6 02:08:54 2015 UTC,"We should be able to acknowledge flaws even in those we admire. Cubeworld even in it's current state is quite a work of art most people could not accomplish. That being said, he really did mess up big time after release, and through his lack of communication people assume the worst.  There are many valid points on why what he did was harmful to the indie dev community, and why people feel cheated. To blanket everyone criticising him a crybaby is no more than fanatical fanboyism.  ""It's was a big event he was excited about"" explains, but doesn't excuse the FACT that he mislead people."
CubeWorld,34wdvc,MonsterLuna,-1,Wed May 6 03:40:26 2015 UTC,"How did he mislead people? he released an alpha, fixed a really cheating bug, and went back to work. Also, although it may be a flaw, anyone who followed wollay before (alpha) release would know hes a very quiet person, its just because lots of popular youtubers covered the game that lots more people who weren't aware of wollays work habits came into the game expected it to be like all the rest. I mean, at least we didn't have a phil fish incident with wollay. At least we know from the few updates we have got from wollay responding to emails that he is still working on the game and its making good progress.  I called people crybabies because even a year, or what is it two years?, after alpha release, people still come to complain about how their game has no updates. Honestly, cut it out, its 20 bucks, easily earned in 2-3 hours of work, not hard. Are people really that attached to 20 bucks? as long as you got 2-3 hours out of the game, you really got full value.  Anyways, to address the indie dev community point, i would say because of how detached he is, he isnt really part of the community anyways, its just his hobby. People feel too entitled, and have too many expectations of him. The product he released, even though its alpha, is much higher quality than many things people get in early access for more money anyways."
CubeWorld,34wdvc,Alkein,5,Wed May 6 03:58:34 2015 UTC,"You walk into a shop, you see some nice shinny apples amongst all the other fruit. You buy a few, then the very next day they are all mouldy. You go to return the apples and the shop keeper laughs at you: ""Don't you know the farmer? His fruit always goes mouldy the next day, don't be a cry baby, you got a days worth of apples""  He mislead people by telling them, on the site you but it from, there would be ""regular updates"". If you don't believe me go check, it's still there. Nowhere is a link to a blog that explains his process, nowhere does it say it's a hobby and might not even be worked on part time. Nowhere does it say updates will be sporadic at best. We got a few bug fixes but no extra content.  I'm one of the people who would have happily paid $20 even if I knew the current alpha was all I was ever getting.  The damage to the indie community wasn't his standing in it, it was the number of people scared of devs taking the money then never being heard from, and thus not supporting devs doing the right thing."
CubeWorld,34wdvc,MonsterLuna,1 point,Wed May 6 04:12:48 2015 UTC,"Good point, i forgot that the ""regular updates"" thing was on the website, although just to play devils advocate i would say its because his perception of regular, based on the way he had been working on the game for awhile, is skewed. Therefore Wollays regular != other devs regular. But your right, its was misleading and some other wording would have worked better.  About the metaphor, it would be more accurate if it went like this (at least for most people): You know this celebrity, and you follow everything they do, one day, you notice hes eating this really tasty looking apple, and then he tells all his fans ""Hey i got this apple from this apple farmer over here"" So everyone rushes to buy it, and so do you. But, you find out that the apple, although tasty, its supply ran out, and when you went to ask the apple farmer why he is out of apples, he says ""Oh, growing apples takes time, and im only one man, but dont worry, next harvest there will be more and they will be better.""   And yeah, i see what you mean about how to the average person, its can be a scare that many devs will take the money and run, but i think wollay is kind of in a middleground. You have so many early access and kickstarter projects that promise a ton, or are getting ACTUAL regular updates, but still may be in a bad state, but once its funded enough, boom the person vanishes. (War Z/Infestation Stories, what a POS, why did i preorder D: ) You also have the projects and early access titles that are amazing (kerbal space program for example) But wollay never promised much, as continued as usual, although however long its been is still longer than usual. At least he stays in contact.  My main hope is that this subreddit, would turn away from being r/wollayhate and become /r/cubeworld again.

Face it, it's boring and empty and there really is nothing to do but the same damn dungeons over and over again with 0 variation.  He never promised much?  He promised communication and regular updates, not hiding like some reclusive autist.  Let alone letting his store page expire."
CubeWorld,34wdvc,ColinStyles,8,Mon May 11 01:40:25 2015 UTC,"It's a hobby, and Wollay made a custom engine to run it. I can't even imagine how long it would take one/two people to plan, design, model, code, test everything without help. He just made a mistake releasing when he did, and I can understand not wanting to hire anyone else. He needs to use social media though. I know in his mind it's probably ""I told people I was working on quests and I'm still doing that so why would I tweet about it?"" People need communication."

Look at the alpha: you can play for hours and not find a single bug.  As the game stands right now, nearly everything works as intended.  It's quite smooth and if somebody had told me this was the full, final product instead of an alpha, I probably would have believed them.  Wollay doesn't want to release something that will be buggy or weird in any way.  He's working on new features like quests and a modified power system I think and he will release them once he is happy with them.  He does his own testing and everything.  And it's quite possible that he has felt the need to completely recode some things over the years.  As it's a hobby for him, it would not surprise me if some days he just said ""I really don't want to redo this"" and didn't work on the game for a few days.  There are no updates to post after you've posted videos of the working aspects of what you're making and then you're spending the rest of your time fiddling with things under the hood.  I think we would all still like to see just a tweet saying ""yes I'm still doing it"" but I do believe in him."
CubeWorld,34wdvc,Chris1mmortal,7,Sun May 10 16:41:39 2015 UTC,"RE: ""It's his hobby"".  It stopped being a ""hobby"" when he started selling it to the public.  At that point it became a business."
CubeWorld,34wdvc,LudwigVan666,3,Tue May 5 17:21:02 2015 UTC,Not sure why you are getting downvoted... he wouldn't have sold it if he wasn't looking to make money..... he can be serious about his business though
CubeWorld,34wdvc,SlowerMonkey,6,Wed May 6 00:58:32 2015 UTC,"I have a similar take on it. Some people earn from their hobby, but he put a serious store, website, Facebook, Twitter up, did interviews, promised updates etc.  People down vote these things because they think it's the typical anti wollay circle jerk, it's not, it's an objective look at how he presented the development of cubeworld when it was sold. Acknowledging these things doesn't mean the game is shit or that we are not hanging out for an update like everyone else."
CubeWorld,34wdvc,MonsterLuna,5,Wed May 6 01:25:30 2015 UTC,"""I won't release the game until it's completely done""....releases the game in alpha to be bought."
CubeWorld,34wdvc,JustSomeTurtle,2,Thu May 7 06:36:17 2015 UTC,"He is working on random quest update.  I just want to ask you, if you know how much work and how hard is that to do on randomly generated map?  He is alone and he's trying to do a randomly genereted quest on radomly genereted map. And when the update Will come, that Will be fantastic.  But CW was his school project and a hobby. He have a job, a famaliy and a life! He just don't want to spend 5h on a CW but maybe he just spend 1h on a day and then he's doing something else.  But if you buy alpha version of the game you can be just happy. other games (rust, the forest, etc.) are just crashing, there is like 40% of content in gama that CW has. etc.  Just thing what wolly give you for a alpha game and what others gived you!"
CubeWorld,34wdvc,Take4spam,3,Tue May 5 23:50:11 2015 UTC,"I'd argue ""random""(procedural) generation is much easier than making all that content by hand. But that is beside the point.  It only takes a few seconds for him to post a weekly update. Which could be as simple as ""busy week at work, no progress this week""."
CubeWorld,34wdvc,MonsterLuna,1 point,Wed May 6 01:31:42 2015 UTC,Wollay DOES have ridiculously high standards though. I've never seen random generation look as good and seamless as Wollay has managed to do all by himself. As for the update thing I assume he just doesn't see a point. Or he really didn't like how nuts people got on Twitter and he distanced himself from it. Not saying that was the right decision  though.
CubeWorld,34wdvc,2nddimension,2,Wed May 6 14:13:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there is a lot of subtle detail. For instance: if a mob is chaseing you across a river/pond, they will not chase directly if swimming away to the bank and running a longer distance over land is a quicker way of reaching you. That's complex path finding.  I feel like he probably thinks removing the game from sale has bought him the right not to need to communicate."
CubeWorld,34wdvc,MonsterLuna,1 point,Thu May 7 00:54:26 2015 UTC,"That's actually rather simple pathfinding.  Done with vector fields, you just need to define a large enough area around the player to get very good pathing."
CubeWorld,34wdvc,ColinStyles,1 point,Mon May 11 01:45:51 2015 UTC,"I'm tempted to think you're mistaking simplicity for efficiency, but given you suggest vector fields and a ""large area"" around the player, I'm not sure what your thinking.  Surely A* or dijkstra' weighted for block type would be most efficient, IMO more simple than generating vector fields, but either way more complex than he could have used."
CubeWorld,34wdvc,MonsterLuna,3,Mon May 11 02:07:35 2015 UTC,"If recent emails that have surfaced are to be believed, they ARE serious. It could be the alpha was just a poorly communicated kick-starter type thing. That is, ""Buy the product as it is now, so I can get funding to finish it."""
CubeWorld,34wdvc,RanaktheGreen,0,Tue May 5 02:53:37 2015 UTC,"That is, ""Buy the product as it is now, so I can get funding to finish it.""   He never once stated this, and IIRC he stated exactly the opposite on several interviews back at release.  But hey, lets keep changing the narrative to fit the views, despite it being very easy to check."
CubeWorld,34wdvc,ColinStyles,0,Mon May 11 01:44:47 2015 UTC,"Except he did state in an interview that he thought using an alpha was a good idea to fund a finished project.

It's April Fools all over again.  Anyways, to answer your question, I would say the size of some of the biomes.

CubeWorld,34jpm4,Yukaro,41,Fri May 1 19:03:53 2015 UTC,I'm beginning to think the reason for the lack of updates/communication is because the Quests Update is so much fun Wollay and Pixxie can't stop playing it.

If you go and look st his old blog (when I started following the game) he posted something at least once a month IIRC.  I dunno how long jts been since he made a tweet or statement just giving us an update on progress.  But, I love that he's responding to individuals sending respectful emails.  Hell he may be staying away from public forums and shit because of how much shit the community gives him  Please don't stop Wollay Im sorry we were mean."

CubeWorld,34bzph,funtimerror,0,Thu Apr 30 12:25:05 2015 UTC,"What I meant is instead of basically saying ""Your shop is down and you barely update, fuck you I won't pay for your game"" I'll pirate it till I can buy it, if everyone pirated it and no one bought it then surely there'd never be an update."
CubeWorld,34bzph,MonsterLuna,8,Thu Apr 30 14:14:41 2015 UTC,"Tons of people bought it, no update for years :p"
CubeWorld,34bzph,MonsterLuna,2,Thu Apr 30 14:21:34 2015 UTC,"The general sentiment here is that we all love the game, it's great and has so much potential. However the Dev took our money and won't even speak to us. Most people feel no loyalty to the dev team because they don't appear to have put in much effort over a long time since we last supported them.  If he was under financial stress, family illness, had been hacked, ect ect the community might be a little more forgiving, but instead we are know nothing.  There is a bit of back and forth here over wether this is spoilt or entitled behaviour/attitude. There are arguments that he has damaged the credibility of other indies seeking funding in alpha. Some people feel ripped off as the website claimed there would be regular updates. Some people just love to bitch.  Myself I believe the alpha is worth the $20 I paid. I personally like to believe he has taken the store down until he can better deliver on what he has promised. Support him when you can, but don't deny yourself a chance to play the game out of loyalty to a dev who won't supply it to you."

Perhaps he didn't account for people just checking out the site, there is a post right now at the top of the subreddit showing the spike in cubeworld searches on google during that time.  Even so, makes no sense that it's still down for that reason."

I also know that if they did contain anything as morbid as my example, it would probably have been found by someone with a bit too much time on their hands.  However, I was not suggesting that this actually happened. I do know that these conditions can state that either party has certain rights under certain conditions; I do imagine that a computer game sold in alpha condition contains something like a clause that prevents any legal action on discontinuation of the project. This makes sense, since otherwise financial issues could become much worse, and probably is completely legal. I did try to find the actual terms, but it is too much of a hassle to prove a point.  So even if my example does not apply, mindlessly signing documents should be called out, especially when either group isn't aware of their legal situation and asks why they are unable to act. I was just illustrating this point. Even a retard should be able to see that."

CubeWorld,33rgth,Theyellowk123,-4,Fri Apr 24 22:50:26 2015 UTC,no lol you get the full game too with that money. I'm not bitching about my $20 bro im bitching about the THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS of people that sent him $20 for alpha access + the full game when it was released.  its like giving someone money as an investor then they just didnt do the project and only made a small portion of it.. you would get sued/ fired from the project
CubeWorld,33rgth,Darkersun,2,Fri Apr 24 22:57:07 2015 UTC,"Thats the risk of investing in an early access game, deal with it."
CubeWorld,33rgth,Cirlex,-3,Fri Apr 24 23:04:44 2015 UTC,no? its not? youre supposed to use the money you get to develop the game. THAT is the point.. the RISK is that the game wont be what the devs/ you wanted it to be.  Your backwards logic makes me want to make a demo for a game and make people pay for it promising that theres more and then to just dissappear into the sunset with my moneys and no plans for an update. Then people like YOU would be throwing money at me AND defending me when im long gone with my loot xD time to devote my career to being the worst software engineer i can be and scamming people like you.. because they should just DEAL WITH IT. lmao your logic dude

Yet, an ordinary person/fan going to one man's door to simply ask a question is considered illegal? I am not saying we have to yell at him, come with pitchforks or demand a refund. I am literally asking for one person to just walk up, and say a few words, if he says doesnt want to talk about the subject then fine the person will just walk away.

Plus, traveling long distance for something as trivial as this might seem a tad obsessive. Thing is, I actually believe him when he says the game is still in active development, but they're probably not working on it full time, and I don't think he's feeling too obligated to deliver a finished product anytime soon.

CubeWorld,33f5cx,MonsterLuna,-1,Wed Apr 22 01:31:40 2015 UTC,"I don't know. I mean, it makes sense that you would think that, and he's likely not giving any news or releasing the update for a comobonation of reasons.  He's surely got to be worried about releasing anything in fear of a horrible backlash, among other things.  However, I also believe it's possible that if he sees that enough people aren't that upset about the whole thing, and they would welcome an update without any uproar, then he might feel more confident to release something to the public.   That's just my two cents on the whole thing - there is no guarantee, by any means, that the petition will work, but it's worth a shot.  Any attempt to get him to get out of his cave at this point is better than just sitting around doing nothing."

CubeWorld,33f5cx,Tiiiimster,3,Wed Apr 29 23:38:54 2015 UTC,"Has anyone thought to get Martyn's (InTheLittleWood) attention on this petition and situation? He was pretty much the biggest YouTuber in support of this game and if anyone could get Wollay's attention, it's him."
CubeWorld,33f5cx,FanFu,0,Sat Apr 25 04:37:04 2015 UTC,"I tried tweeting every YouTuber, but haven't gotten anything. Maybe someone from the UK can send him a letter or something?"

Anyone who has made him aware that the community is dying has gotten their email blocked or instantly diverted to the trash. If he sees no purpose in communicating, he simply won't. It's a very hardcoded german mentality. He doesn't know any of us, want anything from any us, or is truly related to any of us. The only reason people get responses from him is for very technical or specific questions that only he or pixie can reply on if they feel replying serves a purpose. Otherwise, it's pointless smalltalk."

All his Tweets over the last couple of years have amounted to jack-sh!t.  His talk is now meaningless unless he backs it up with a game update of some sort."
CubeWorld,33f5cx,Deaniv,-4,Thu Apr 23 22:34:42 2015 UTC,ty for not being a wollay fan boy and realizing the truth.. he LOLOLOL'd all the way to the bank after someone spent some money on his shit and never looked back. hes NOT COMING BACK. hes NOT UPDATING. game is dead and all of you should be mad because you paid for 1 update.

CubeWorld,33eui4,RansomPirate,1 point,Tue Apr 21 23:29:23 2015 UTC,It's because Cube World hasn't been updated ever since 2013.   (Hey guys. Just because someone doesn't get an obvious joke doesn't mean you should be downvoting them. If anything you should be upvoting them for being bold enough to ask!)

CubeWorld,33bb56,Syberz,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:31:11 2015 UTC,"They've sent emails out as of a couple months ago - they are still definitely developing it. There just isn't much communication going on given how negatively focused the community is. I don't blame them.  It's also been a pet and side project to the jobs that the use to support themselves. They obviously made money off of it, but that's not a long-term replacement for a job.  If you're interested, pirate it and play it for now. And then when updates come along or it reaches beta/full release, then buy it. :)  And ignore the negative parts of the community. Play the game if you enjoy it, and remember that it's in ALPHA. It's very early because so many people demanded they wanted to play it."

CubeWorld,33bb56,TheFinalPancake,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:27:16 2015 UTC,Taking the game off the site is the only reputable thing Wollay has done in two years.  Continuing to sell a game under the guise that it's still being developed is decidedly unethical.

CubeWorld,3347l6,TheFinalPancake,0,Sun Apr 19 13:11:06 2015 UTC,"But wouldnt that mean its dying over time? The game doesnt loose any features, it just stopped growing."
CubeWorld,3347l6,Mr_Zaroc,2,Sun Apr 19 13:51:00 2015 UTC,"But cardiac arrest just means that the person is dead, but a qualified doctor hasn't verified it yet, so technically it's still alive. But dead."

CubeWorld,3347l6,TheFinalPancake,20,Sun Apr 19 18:30:52 2015 UTC,"It's not necessarily dead - the update preview from 9 months ago seems like it would have been harder to fake than to actually make in the game. I'm not sitting here hoping every day for Wollay to come out with the big update, but I see it as a fair possibility. So don't obsess over the game, but don't feel too bad just yet - there's still time before the doctor calls it on this one."
CubeWorld,3347l6,UltimaN3rd,11,Sun Apr 19 11:13:24 2015 UTC,"It's amazing that this game, that hasn't been updated in two years, is still more streamlined than Trove, which gets constant updates. I love the game and hope it'll be revived one day!"

I do from time to time, and I'm still discovering cool new things that seem like they would be straight out of a game like skyrim. Just the other day, I found a cool castle style dungeon at the edge of a peninsula jutting out into an ocean biome. It looked awesome!  Anyways. I digress. Chances are that it will be updated eventually. In the meantime, there are plenty of other games to play. Try Oblivion or Torchlight 2 or even GTA 5 PC. They're all great games."
CubeWorld,3347l6,Sendoria,2,Thu Apr 23 16:19:29 2015 UTC,"I have those games and I like them alot. I recently played Cube World again but then something weird happened, something I never expected from Cube World. After nearly  two years now my perspective on games has changed alot. So when I went back to Cube World without all the hype I had when it launched, I realized how broken and unfinished it was. It's all so empty and all you do is run from town to town and eventually you come across a dungeon and go through that. What I am trying to say is that when you look at Cube World from a more critical side, it's just an unfinished, generic RPG, yes, I said generic. Because the cube look doesnt influence the gameplay. You could have made the world out of cake and it would still play the same. Ok, enough rambling now."
CubeWorld,3347l6,Sendoria,3,Thu Apr 23 17:51:04 2015 UTC,Okay. To each their own. I still love it. Agree to disagree? : )

CubeWorld,330ql1,TheFinalPancake,7,Sat Apr 18 12:13:53 2015 UTC,"If it's 'broken', throw it away. Give it to someone else."
CubeWorld,330ql1,neogetz,3,Sat Apr 18 12:22:12 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but if you bought it 7 months ago that was after a year of no updates so it shouldn't have caught you by surprise. One should always learn about the games they are looking at purchasing, especially with alpha builds. Even big brand games can disappoint in ways that a little research would have shown before making the purhase."
CubeWorld,330ql1,NoTrueKing,2,Sat Apr 18 12:22:20 2015 UTC,"Having played the game a considerable amount of time since the August after the game released, I didn't notice anything broken, just a lot of room for planned features. I consider the money I spent buying the game as well spent, but I can see why you'd be disappointed.  Welcome aboard mate, from the rest of us longing for an update!"
CubeWorld,330ql1,Zalamander,2,Sat Apr 18 11:52:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think I ever ran into a game-breaking bug while playing. It's an alpha product, so there will be imbalances and lacking features. I wouldn't have bought into the game unless the playable state at the time I bought it was what I felt to be worth the money.  Limited features considered, I still managed to get 80-100 hours of play out of my investment. And the first 10-20 where pure wonderment. Not everyone will have the same experience, but I'd argue that those who didn't probably aren't the best demographic to be buying into alpha, beta, early access, etc.  Make educated purchases. Don't buy into alpha's with expectations of completed products, unless you are up for the gamble.   I'm sorry the game didn't meet your expectations. It sucks you didn't find this subreddit before you bought because the state of development was fairly well discussed by then and there should be no surprises. As it is, posts like this are just adding to a circlejerk."
CubeWorld,330ql1,TheFinalPancake,1 point,Sat Apr 18 12:08:55 2015 UTC,"i knew it was in alpha and thats why i was willing to pay £12 then, the fact its made hardly any development since then is why i am disappointed, im still gona wait afew months i hear a update is supposed to be coming out, money isnt what anoys me its the lack of updates and as the game is no longer purchasable it seams like even the developers dont expect the game to leave alpha"
CubeWorld,330ql1,TheFinalPancake,2,Sat Apr 18 12:17:56 2015 UTC,"when i said broken i dont mean game breaking bug i mean features which are broken/unbalanced   Use 'broken' in a definition of 'broken'.  Clears it right up.  Anyway, £12. £12. You bought this game for £12 7 months ago in 2014. Minimum wage in 2014 was £6.50 per hour. That means that this game costed you less than two hours of minimum wage work.  How shocking it must be to have (at most) two hours of your (parents, probably) life/lives to be wasted so you could play a game for 'a few days', presumably 12 hours.  Two hours.... for 12 (ish) hours. Doesn't seem like a bad trade. Quit your bitching."

CubeWorld,330ql1,TheFinalPancake,1 point,Sat Apr 18 12:24:47 2015 UTC,"So you aren't bothered by the money, which means that this game took nothing from you, especially considering it was hardly your money."

CubeWorld,32fvtk,c10ne,1 point,Mon Apr 13 22:10:26 2015 UTC,You want to talk manners? How about being silent for over a year while your paying customers are left wondering what is going on?
CubeWorld,32fvtk,GoochRash,0,Mon Apr 13 14:22:42 2015 UTC,"You are exactly the type I mean. Bro, you PAID once like the rest of us. You bought the game as is. It's not a subscription so Wollay isn't under any obligation implied or otherwise to actually do anything else with the game. It functions and is quite fun as is. IT's not perfect and certainly not finished, but that's for him to decide.  Down vote me all you like, but notice how you ASSUME you're owed something? You wanna pay a sub for a game, then yes, DEMAND the content you're owed. But frankly, harassing a dude because he didn't release more onto his game is not only stupid, but some of you take it to fanatical and illegal levels.  The entire point of the post; Chill out.  And because I suppose my implied view was clear enough, I do NOT think Wollay handled this even remotely well. By giving no updates, having no contact and no longer selling the game he has killed any further income and interest aside from those of us who have already payed. I'm not about to e-stalk the dude and pretend that this guy owes me something.  He's wrong, but you're also wrong. I bought Diablo 3 knowing that Blizzard has a well deserved track record of content and updates. However, if they suddenly stopped making content, I'd be bummed, but not pissed off. I'm not paying for any of what they are releasing. Do you and these other people get this upset at these other games as well?  Just sayin'."
CubeWorld,32fvtk,WileeDarklight,6,Mon Apr 13 14:34:19 2015 UTC,"You bought the game as is. It's not a subscription so Wollay isn't under any obligation implied or otherwise to actually do anything else with the game.    I would disagree with this. A lot.    Wollay posted a whole bunch of ideas of where he wanted to go with the game, and opened it up for sale as an Alpha.  People bought it for what it was going to be in the long term while enjoying the base mechanics of what made it Cubeworld.  There's hundreds of games doing the same thing; selling in the Alpha stage, using the money made to help develop it.  People are just miffed that this is one of the few games that literally didn't go anywhere, but with the added anger of them putting money forth only to find out that they were mislead.    Granted, this game is the perfect example of the risks of crowd sourcing, the point is that people expected it to be more because Wollay originally said it would be more.  So far he has completely failed to follow through on that."
CubeWorld,32fvtk,GoochRash,2,Mon Apr 13 18:51:43 2015 UTC,"I can see your point. I appreciate you putting it forward without have to be a jerk about it. I think we can all agree that Wollay didn't handle much right after sales went live. And while we all may agree or disagree over what should have went down, the threats, people searching for his home and business information and the conspiracy theories need to ease up. I'd likely stop developing and go into hiding too if some neckbeard with the social awareness of a g rape kept calling my personal home phone demanding an update.  Scary shit.   On the flip side, while this may be a crowd sourcing fail, there are always shining examples of good sourcing, such as from Shovel Knight. That game is a goddamn pleasure to play.  Either way, point taken. He owes us in a manner of speaking, but not to the point some folks are taking it, I think."
CubeWorld,32fvtk,Syberz,-2,Mon Apr 13 20:44:03 2015 UTC,Haha I like how you made many assertions about how I am just based on my comment. I don't ever expect an update. I think how he handled this entire thing has been complete shit. I know I've been had and my money is gone. And the things that we're advertised along side of the purchase aren't coming but I've made peace with that. But it is clear you just want to argue with someone and are looking for an outlet for it. Go troll for that from someone else.
CubeWorld,32fvtk,TheFinalPancake,2,Mon Apr 13 14:59:32 2015 UTC,"So hostile man. Not looking for an argument at all. Just hoping that people like you who are out for blood will calm the hell down. I made no assumptions or assertions. I took the tone and meaning directly from your message. You feel like you've been had, I feel ya man. We all do. And I'm sure we'd ALL love an update for even a ""Hi, I'm alive and stuff"" tweet to let us know. But these people bashing those preaching patience is destructive and flat out dumb.   There are people looking up this guy's home and office addresses and phone numbers trying to contact him over this. I cna't say I blame him for bailing out, I would too if a bunch of rabid kids with no sense of space and social grace were invading my privacy because they feel entitled to something.   My only question to you then is; if you've made the peace you claim to have, why respond to this post with immediate hostility?  Hard to point the finger at him for poor manners when you're looking to bash anyone and anything that moves on the topic. Hell, I'm agreeing with you and you're claiming I'm out for a fight or trolling. Take two breaths, and go have some tea."

The last tweet was june 30 2014, almost a year ago. the last actual UPDATE was a year and a half ago.   Either wollay has decided to stop working on cube world or hes spending so little time on it, he cant even get a quest system done after over a year of working on it.   At this point the game is dead, theres no reason to keep working on it because everyone has moved on and forgot about it. There might be a chance that they are still working on it but i doubt it, its been silent for too long."
CubeWorld,32ejep,mattymck,0,Mon Apr 13 16:24:31 2015 UTC,"There have been emails from them that say they are still working on it. You could call bullshit if you want, but if they really did give up, I don't see why they wouldn't just tell everyone that.   There might be a chance that they are still working on it but i doubt it, its been silent for too long.   Didn't I just address that? Them being silent is the best choice they could make if they're still working on it. They have zero deadlines and zero expectations to live up to. My post was pointing out that silence is not an indication of an abandoned project. You can have your doubts, but their silence is not supporting evidence. If anything it's evidence to the contrary, as I've explained.  Can you think of a good reason for them not telling anyone that they've abandoned the project, while lying to people via email? They're not making any money by being silent."

No significant features were added.  In my opinion the version before the second patch is better because it has a glitch with the hang glider as a ranger, which makes travelling easier. There was meant to be fast means of transportation implemented, like a fast-travel type thing, but of course it never was.  Here is the entire update log for Cube World:   July 23, 2013   Added an option to limit the frame rate  (see options menu: FPS limit; default 111 fps) Ranger ability 'Scout's switftness' doesn't crash on multiplayer servers anymore Ranger ability 'Retreat' doesn't increase hang gliding speed anymore The crossbow's right mouse button ability now only does damage when charged You can now reset the day in inns only between 6:00 P.M. and 6:00 A.M. Fixed a bug where multiplayer groups received too much XP for missions   July 5, 2013   Added an option to invert the y-axis Fixed a bug where MP could be regenerated with the 'O' key Fixed a bug where players could sell non-existing items from their inventory Improved some launcher issues"

Especially since it only applies to multiplayer.   Hang glider range glitch   Again, being able to fly further than you're supposed to be able to, which is only possible as one of the 4 classes, really isn't a game-breaking glitch, if anything it's a good thing since fast-travel was never added, as I previously stated.   ""No inn""   If by this you meant You can now reset the day in inns only between 6:00 P.M. and 6:00 A.M. before this was ""fixed"" you could reset the time whenever you wanted, inns were still present in the game.

Look at the actor who plays captain america. he goes and visits children's hospitals for -free- because it boosts his image and comfirms his passion. Look at the makers of Goat Simulator. They made over a million in sales and decided to make a full dlc (goat mmo sim) for free, because it's fun for them. The same goes for redigit, tiy, robobob, the left4dead team, icefrog, the team working on don't starve together, etc. etc.,Wollay's phd is in building autonomous landscapes from noise fields in realtime. I am willing to bet he -really- wants to make this game, but doesn't have the funding, and just hasn't put in as many years as his mentors and predecessors, so he simply doesn't know -how- to make a procedural cel-based universe, but since he doesn't trust anyone outside of his bubble, its impossible for him to make any speedy forward development. I am willing bet at least 100 dollars that if he sat down with Tarn Adams(who has already created a procedural cel-based rpg world with living, thinking npcs and quests), he would figure this whole thing out in a heartbeat, but nope, that's never going to happen because wollay wants to do this -by himself- slowly, stubbornly, behind all standards of progression with  only his wife and most loyal of fans to support him, so ya know.... that's it.

I hope one day you can find a career that you have passion for."
CubeWorld,31lhd6,Dicethrower,0,Mon Apr 6 21:30:56 2015 UTC,"I'm a developer myself, so you don't have to lecture me on love and passion for developing games. The point is that wollay clearly lacks this passion or he would have continued working on it. The fact that he had a 'hall of fame' moment in his reach and hasn't even shown any desire to pursue this is a shame to everyone like me, who has struggled years of their lives to make it in this incredibly harsh industry. If someone with wollay's attitude of 0 production and 0 communication stepped into any studio, he'd be fired within a week or 2.    It's sad that you think it's impossible for people to be able to make a lot of money doing something they love.     It's sad that you still think he's doing something.     This is exactly the kind of ignorance I'm talking about. Without any sense of how development works, you assess that it's normal for someone to work for 2 years on something with nothing to show for it. Entire engines are written by single people in a year, entire MMOs are made within a year. You're telling me that a simple feature like random quests for a game that already has all the tools present in the game takes 2 years? Why even bother entering a discussion you know nothing about?"
CubeWorld,31lhd6,vegeta897,0,Tue Apr 7 07:02:46 2015 UTC,You assume he isn't still working on it just because we haven't seen anything yet. As if nobody has ever worked on anything in silence for this long.  How does the fact that engines or games can be written in a year prove anything? There are just as many cases of games and development tasks that have taken this long or longer to do. How do you know he has nothing to show for it at this point? Why are you assuming that random quests are the only feature he's been working on? Why do you assume he didn't decide to scrap his first (or second) implementation and redo it? Why do you assume he didn't have one of a thousand possible real life issues that demanded a significant amount of his time?   Why do you assume he didn't take any sort of hiatus in response to his massive overnight popularity? Neither of us have ever been in that position so neither of us can speak confidently about what we would or would not do. You make a mountain of assumptions while I allow for reasonable possibilities.
CubeWorld,31lhd6,Dicethrower,1 point,Tue Apr 7 14:17:36 2015 UTC,"For all of those assumptions I can give you the same answer, because there's no reason to assume he has worked (on anything else). You're the one making the positive claims and they are in no way reasonable, all you do is speculate under the assumption he's still working on it, despite that there's no evidence for it. I on the other hand make the assumption he stopped working on it, because I know what a developer does when he cares about something and what a developer does when he doesn't care. No communication is not a sign of a developer who is passionate about his work and can't wait to show the world what he made."

CubeWorld,31kptn,kynect2hymn,2,Mon Apr 6 00:46:56 2015 UTC,"Expressing displeasure at getting fleeced in a business deal is not being ""crybabies"". We were promised more, and are way past the reasonable time of waiting for it compared to industry standards.   Wollay took the money and ran, so yeah, some of us are not too happy about it.  I'm curious - if you browse EBAY and see negative feedback on a seller, do you send the people who left the feedback ""arrived late, was not the product I was promised"" an email telling them to quit whining? Probably not, because feedback like can be used to warn people of scams and untrustworthy vendors. Same deal here."
CubeWorld,31kptn,Daiwon,0,Mon Apr 6 02:36:44 2015 UTC,THE GAME WAS LIKE $15 GET OVER IT.
CubeWorld,31kptn,blueyb,1 point,Mon Apr 6 02:45:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, $15 that was given in good faith for getting a fully featured game at a later date. Wollay did this to himself, he could even mention that he's still working on things every now and then but he chooses to stay silent. When other devs do this they get crucified for not delivering and Wollay deserves no better treatment the second he put his game up for sale."
CubeWorld,31kptn,Daiwon,-1,Mon Apr 6 12:37:55 2015 UTC,"How did you get fleeced? You were promised a finished game, which isn't done yet, so stop complaining and be patient. He never promised regular updates, just the one after the first.  I don't browse EBAY. And no, it's not at all the same, the game you were promised isn't finished and you bought into an alpha, it was exactly what he promised."
CubeWorld,31kptn,Tramd,2,Mon Apr 6 02:42:04 2015 UTC,"No, you're 100% right.  The game's just not finished yet. It's sill in alpha.  And the update is coming! It's coming people! The prince of Nigeria told me it's coming! And I will be buying extra copies from the money I get back from Bernie Madoff, which I know will be any day now!   Now if you excuse me, I have a popup window telling me my computer is riddled with spyware and viruses, and only SPYSHERRIFF can clean it, so I've got to get that ordered to clean up my computer."

EDIT: ""White Knight” (also known as “Internet White Knight”) is a pejorative term used to describe men who defend women on the Internet with the assumption that they are looking for a romantic reward in return.""  Are you calling Wollay or yourself a woman?"
CubeWorld,31kptn,FanFu,0,Mon Apr 6 01:39:51 2015 UTC,There need not be an actual woman involved to act like a white knight. I'm sure wollay will be just fine without you championing for him.

CubeWorld,31dc14,Tramd,9,Sat Apr 4 02:15:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly, just don't get the game at all. It's hardly worth buying, let alone torrenting. There's a reason this sub is dead and Wollay abandoned the game."
CubeWorld,31dc14,thedieversion,-1,Sat Apr 4 18:16:34 2015 UTC,"This sub is far from dead from what I see, got around 10 comments in a day"
CubeWorld,31dc14,thedieversion,17,Sat Apr 4 18:32:36 2015 UTC,Because everyone comes together to tell you to NOT support the game whenever they can. Just look at the responses in this thread.
CubeWorld,31dc14,Tramd,6,Sat Apr 4 18:44:42 2015 UTC,"It doesn't really. The gameplay as it is now consists of mindlessly grinding with not much in the form of progression. It's basically an open world sandbox to run around in, that's it."
CubeWorld,31dc14,HollisFenner,-4,Sat Apr 4 20:32:52 2015 UTC,Maybe because it's version 0.1 and it was an unfinished update pushed out so people who were complaining had something to play instead of crying on Reddit.
CubeWorld,31dc14,Tramd,3,Sun Apr 5 01:27:01 2015 UTC,"Bold strategy cotton, let's see how that play out...."
CubeWorld,31dc14,HollisFenner,-8,Sun Apr 5 17:53:47 2015 UTC,"Don't listen to the majority of this sub. Wollay didn't even want to release a build, but he was heckled so much. I'm sure the game will be available for purchase again soon."
CubeWorld,31dc14,Tonio64286,18,Sun Apr 5 18:05:57 2015 UTC,It's very simple- there is no way you can get the game anymore without torrenting it.  If you're dying to get it; just torrent it.  You don't really have to feel guilty about doing so as Wollay basically ripped everyone off in the first place.
CubeWorld,31dc14,etherpanda,5,Sun Apr 5 17:52:57 2015 UTC,But can I play with my friend if I torrent?
CubeWorld,31dc14,HollisFenner,7,Sat Apr 4 00:34:24 2015 UTC,yes if you are hosting a server
CubeWorld,31dc14,Tonio64286,-21,Sat Apr 4 03:10:22 2015 UTC,"Wollay ripped no one off. Him and his wife are the only two working on the game and recently showed progress on a new update. You can wait to purchase the game, get a DRM free copy from us until the game is patched, or torrent it."
CubeWorld,31dc14,HollisFenner,14,Sat Apr 4 05:44:09 2015 UTC,recently showed progress on a new update  Almost 10 months ago is not recent.
CubeWorld,31dc14,roobedoo,-25,Sat Apr 4 17:25:38 2015 UTC,It is if you aren't impatient. I'm sorry they aren't working fast enough for you. You can either wait for the update or cry about it some more.  Edit: looks like he opted to cry some more.
CubeWorld,31dc14,HollisFenner,15,Sat Apr 4 17:56:33 2015 UTC,"But 10 months is a long time, without even a shred of news. I look over the website and get hyped and love this game, but without any news, I'm finding it hard to believe we haven't just been left for dead..."
CubeWorld,31dc14,Tramd,-17,Sat Apr 4 18:20:55 2015 UTC,"I guess there are just too many games for me too play, that I don't care that Wollay and his wife are taking the time to give us a great, feature filled and hopefully bug free update to a game that he has poured his life into. If you are really upset that they are taking time to polish and possibly add more big features, then I don't think I'll ever understand where you're coming from, as I'm a pretty patient person."
CubeWorld,31dc14,HollisFenner,6,Sat Apr 4 18:30:46 2015 UTC,"If you are really upset that they are taking time to polish and possibly add more big features,   We literally have no idea if this is the case. I mean, it will come when it does but this amount of time is nothing but absurd any way you look at it."
CubeWorld,31dc14,Tramd,-10,Sat Apr 4 18:39:35 2015 UTC,We know that they are adding a totally redone quest system with plenty of variation and we know that they had no idea when it would be done.
CubeWorld,31dc14,CynicalCouch,9,Sun Apr 5 01:25:31 2015 UTC,Been almost a year since we heard about that.
CubeWorld,31dc14,HollisFenner,3,Sun Apr 5 01:48:57 2015 UTC,"I guess you have too much money, or you enjoy poor quality free2play"
CubeWorld,31dc14,CynicalCouch,-3,Sun Apr 5 02:14:56 2015 UTC,"So because I have other games to play, I either have lots of money or love f2p games? Haha what an assumption!"
CubeWorld,31dc14,roobedoo,4,Sun Apr 5 23:39:52 2015 UTC,"Pretty fair assumption, games are expensive, and if youre not buying, its f2p"
CubeWorld,31dc14,HollisFenner,2,Mon Apr 6 00:31:51 2015 UTC,"True, guess I'll just play some other stuff and if that fateful day does come I will jump with joy and sit down for a long haul of the new update...I believe Lord..."
CubeWorld,31dc14,Dicethrower,-10,Mon Apr 6 01:14:57 2015 UTC,"Now you're getting it! If the update is meant to come, it will eventually come. It's not really are place to rush them, especially if we want a good end result."
CubeWorld,31dc14,Zalak123,18,Sat Apr 4 18:52:28 2015 UTC,"People really need to stop downvoting wollay bashing if they care anything about the industry. If we want to keep crowd funding, if we want to keep early accesses, if we want to keep the indie market, etc, there should be a strong message to every gamer and every developer that this, the way wollay did it, is not the way to go. It should not be washed away with faith and say that he'll eventually finish or ""it can still happen"" or wash away that ""it's already worth its money"". Promises were made and promises were not delivered. All we know now is that they bought a new house and have been busy with that... years ago. Clearly they're not trying very hard to finish the game, yet meanwhile have reaped the rewards. That's a scam if I've ever seen one."
CubeWorld,31dc14,SaturdayMorningSwarm,9,Sat Apr 4 18:53:38 2015 UTC,hell yeah
CubeWorld,31dc14,HollisFenner,4,Sat Apr 4 07:31:27 2015 UTC,"Buying the early access copy did entitle us to the full version didn't it?  Not getting the full version done by a certain time isn't really a breach of contract, but abandoning the project would definitely seem to be.  With the sheer amount of people who payed 20 euros it's probably a huge amount of money that Wollay now owes.  Preventing more people from buying it is probably a protective measure to make sure that the situation doesn't get too out of hand: it'd probably make one hell of a class action already if someone decided to pursue it."
CubeWorld,31dc14,SaturdayMorningSwarm,-3,Sat Apr 4 08:26:16 2015 UTC,You can't really sue him for not working fast enough. Its not like he abandoned it.
CubeWorld,31dc14,HollisFenner,4,Sat Apr 4 12:45:12 2015 UTC,"The last update was July 23 2013, the game is no longer available for purchase, and you can't register on the Picorama website anymore.  Of the two developers one hasn't said anything publicly for almost a year, the other one and a half years.  At this point deciding if the project has been abandoned or if he is simply working so slowly that development has stopped is splitting hairs."
CubeWorld,31dc14,ColinStyles,-3,Sat Apr 4 17:28:18 2015 UTC,"Why would Wollay tease a new update in June, then not follow up and say anything? Don't you think he would say if he abandoned it so he would stop getting so much hate from people that don't necessarily understand how game development works? Remember when game development happened behind closed doors and you rarely heard anything about development? Just because you are so used to early access games and kickstarter, does not at all mean that Wollay is responsible for updating you on what he is doing or keeping you interested. The only reason he released a build is because so many people were asking him to, now look what it's done.  ""I know many of you want me to release the game in its current state. This might work for a sandbox game but it doesn't work well for an action RPG like Cube World. We still need to add things like a start screen, menues, save slots and character creation, more content and need to finish the homepage. I don't know how long this will take but we're doing our best to finish everything as soon as possible.""  That is straight off of his personal blog. Once again, i'm sorry if you are so against waiting for an update without hearing constant reminders that it will be here someday."
CubeWorld,31dc14,HollisFenner,2,Sat Apr 4 22:10:31 2015 UTC,"Because he changed his mind?  Because he felt it would calm down the hate against him?  Because he finds it fun to string people along?  Any number of reasons that doesn't mean he will release an update.  Welcome to life, people"
CubeWorld,31dc14,ColinStyles,0,Sat Apr 4 22:40:59 2015 UTC,"None of those reasons would make any sense, you'd think he'd tell you if he stopped working on it so people would stop hating on him. Letting people believe you are working on something when you're not only hurts your image."
CubeWorld,31dc14,HollisFenner,0,Thu Apr 9 21:11:48 2015 UTC,"No, because instead of all of the hatred at once, he's taking it in small doses.  You think people would stop hating on him if he abandoned it?  Really?  That's definitely not the case.  He'd go from ""the guy who nearly definitely scammed us and wasted great potential in a game"" to ""The guy who did scam us and wasted great potential in a game"""
CubeWorld,31dc14,seiyria,0,Thu Apr 9 22:29:49 2015 UTC,"That's funny, because you willingly bought an alpha that was never guaranteed to be finished, so you scammed yourself. This is one of the reasons why I find it funny when people get angry at the devs. He is in no binding contract to make this game and is doing it out of passion. Why do you think he said he didn't want to release early access versions or never had a kickstarter?"
CubeWorld,31dc14,HollisFenner,-1,Thu Apr 9 22:36:02 2015 UTC,No promises were made. It was an alpha.

CubeWorld,31al6n,TheAntiHick,1 point,Fri Apr 3 14:53:18 2015 UTC,"Ah shame :/ I know the struggle of losing hours worth of gameplay :P  Mythical tier stuff are only found as recipes in chests. They are thought to be experimental, and only require basic resources to craft (i.e. a mythical bow requires wood only). They are really strong :P  My lvl 105 mage has a mythical staff, and I found it on a seed i found on a website. It was quite a journey though, had to cross over 7 biomes :D And I was like lvl 70 when I started that quest. Great fun haha... But I get you, I love just exploring. I like OP weapons though :3 I currently have a lvl 16 Archer, and I love just running around :)"

He basically said ""yeah, we're working on it but it's taking a while"" and that was it.  It's good to know that he's at least alive, but it's kind of a canned response, so nobody knows thus far if he is ACTUALLY working on the update.  I don't have any pictures as the email is probably somewhere in oblivion now, but I don't have any reason to lie either."

Looks 100% legit. Or you could just send an email as wollay@picroma.com with a little more work.    Emails are just no proof at all until the otherside has confirmed in some otherway they received the mail (in this case Wollay has to show proof).    People just hear what they want to hear.    I am sure he knows the community (what's left of it) is desperately waiting for any news I can't believe he would reply on emails and not send a tweet or blog update for real proof. Both are as easy, but a tweet/blog post are harder to fake than emails, plus more people see it as an added bonus."

All he need to do is just to write ""Hello world"" with screenshots, audio, planned development, just anything that document that he have been developing on the game that we invested in.  You can't just expect people to patiently wait with no communication.  That said, if he has been working on the game for all this time, then I'm pretty stoked to see what he made."

Put on your big boy pants and ignore the hate, because it will always be there."
CubeWorld,300mf0,Plob218,1 point,Tue Mar 24 00:58:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, any toxicity in ""this community"" is 100% on Wollay. I've been following Stonehearth since its Kickstarter and that community is totally engaged and positive. It's because they give us weekly updates on their progress, release small features piecemeal as they are implemented, and listen to fan input/feedback. Basically, totally the opposite of what's happening with Cubeworld.  As far as I'm concerned, the game is dead. I'd love to be proven wrong, but ""proven"" is the key word there. An email is not proof. Even a trailer video would be something!"
CubeWorld,300mf0,Tramd,2,Tue Mar 24 02:23:10 2015 UTC,"Do you have like a flow chart that ends in ""I wouldn't talk to this community either, I don't blame him."" ? It's not like people are outrageously complaining about this, it's a reasonable response."
CubeWorld,300mf0,AkariAkaza,-4,Tue Mar 24 02:48:27 2015 UTC,"I can understand the complaining but there's saying ""I'd like an update for cubeworld"" and ""Wollay's a fucking cunt he needs to update this fucking game or die""."
CubeWorld,300mf0,Tramd,2,Tue Mar 24 13:04:43 2015 UTC,"That is quite literally not what anyone here has said. The general sentiment is ""Screw this guy"" and it's rightfully earned. It's like you're just running through a script that ends with blaming people as if they're the reason he's not bothered to even update his website. That just doesn't make any sense at this point. Almost every argument I see people bring up in defense of him is self defeating as time goes on and nothing happens.   We could probably play bingo with all the excuses people come up with. He's always been like this? Nope, there's a comment pointing out the complete drop off in communication since release. One man developer takes time? Not even close, look at all the other examples of games with one developer. He's avoiding the community because they're mean? He has a website he can blog on with no interaction!  It just looks bad any way you spin it. The saddest thing about it if an update ever does come is that it will likely be overshadowed by other games picking up where cubeworld left off."
CubeWorld,300mf0,pizzamage,-17,Wed Mar 25 00:18:10 2015 UTC,"The thing is he has released some updates on progress and people like you STILL just come back and say ""I'll believe eat when my client gets an update."" Get out of the subreddit if you're just going to spread this toxic attitude."
CubeWorld,300mf0,CrashmanX,16,Wed Mar 25 02:06:24 2015 UTC,"Christ. Y'all are being so defensive. No wonder trolls flock to this subreddit.   The dude isn't being toxic, he's bringing up a point. Toxicity would be if he was slandering Wollay or making up BS. He's bringing up a point which hadn't been addressed."
CubeWorld,300mf0,pizzamage,-18,Wed Mar 25 02:53:14 2015 UTC,"LOL. The point has been addressed, Wollay has provided what thus guy asked for, but because it wasn't on his timetable he's not happy. Boohoo"
CubeWorld,300mf0,CrashmanX,12,Mon Mar 23 19:50:14 2015 UTC,"What? Did you not understand what he suggested? He suggested this is an incredibly easy thing to fake and that actual proof would be better than an image. The dude brings up a valid point that in today's day and age, you need a time-stamp/photo to really prove things anymore."
CubeWorld,300mf0,bryntheskits,3,Mon Mar 23 20:13:11 2015 UTC,Hay man I have the update he's working on on my computer? Don't believe me? Me just saying so should be enough right? No evidence required.
CubeWorld,300mf0,steak21,1 point,Mon Mar 23 20:39:59 2015 UTC,"Well tbh the best way to stop working on a game and kill the community begging for it would not be this way. By putting out an email like this, he's getting people's hopes up. If he wanted to abandon the project he would just give everyone the cold shoulder"
CubeWorld,300mf0,nuinbot,2,Mon Mar 23 20:52:12 2015 UTC,"Or, actually reply saying something to the effect of ""Sorry folks, real life has gotten in the way of development for CubeWorld and I just don't have the time to work on it any longer. I am releasing the last update in a few days (if one exists, that is). Thank you all for your support.""  Tentatively, he could also release it open source via GitHub and let someone else work on it. This, ideally, would be the most logical scenario. Besides, he has already closed down the website in terms of being able to purchase the game."
CubeWorld,300mf0,Daylen,-2,Mon Mar 23 23:25:53 2015 UTC,"Also, even realistically for a one-man team developing part-time a procedural questing system that isn't repetitive doesn't take this long. Hell, in the time since last update someone else could've easily started and overtaken him by now."
CubeWorld,300mf0,abdulzz,4,Tue Mar 24 01:14:40 2015 UTC,"And it's not that the project didn't receive enough popularity. From the hype that was gathered around pre-launch, I think that he could've made it his full-time job.   I just wish that he hadn't prereleased the game, and just waited until it was closer to being finished, or when he had more time to work on it. All the amazing hype around the game has evaporated into thin air and mad customers."
CubeWorld,300mf0,Daylen,1 point,Tue Mar 24 01:20:44 2015 UTC,"He could've made it his full-time job, with a bit of marketing he could've been like the Terraria guys and with full-time development and actual updates he might have very well been lucky enough to be the new Notch. He chose to keep it a side project and that is what will bite him in the ass if he ever does decide to make it any bigger than that."

CubeWorld,300mf0,Daylen,0,Mon Mar 23 20:37:03 2015 UTC,"Bethesda didn't do procedural quests, they just made one quest and put it in a bunch of different caves. The scale is also quite different"
CubeWorld,300mf0,Daylen,-1,Mon Mar 23 20:46:14 2015 UTC,"Well regardless of team and game size, hardcoding quests into a massive map is way more work than procedurally generated quests in a procedurally generated map. I'm not saying it's not a lot of work, you still have to write every piece of possible dialogue (which can be mostly generated but you still have to enter lists of possible words) and make a decent generator. But that's not more than a couple weeks of work even part-time."
CubeWorld,300mf0,WatcherCCG,1 point,Tue Mar 24 07:14:29 2015 UTC,"Nevermind that it's all voice acted. Doing all that in pure text form is simple enough, but getting VAs? That's time AND money spent."

This isn't wow, it's not a game you can expect to play exclusively. So just relax and play a different game in the mean time.  I mean seriously from this subreddit you'd think people committed to only playing this game for the rest of their lives."

CubeWorld,300mf0,RickDripps,7,Mon Apr 6 13:34:15 2015 UTC,I believe it's fake just simply because his website was filled with errors.  I don't believe he can type that quickly and cleanly when replying to an e-mail.
CubeWorld,300mf0,megazen,4,Tue Mar 24 01:42:56 2015 UTC,How about hiring more people to increase development speed.
CubeWorld,300mf0,y2bcrazy,-1,Tue Mar 24 20:27:00 2015 UTC,"no matter how many times you think this is a good idea, it isn't. He's been working on this engine for years from scratch, all by himself. He'd have to teach a person 3 years of work before that person being able to properly contribute to the project, and even then the person might not be of much help.  Hiring people is not always the solution to things, especially regarding programming. You gotta learn the way a programmer codes and it can get really difficult if you didn't start working on it together.  read this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month"

CubeWorld,300mf0,y2bcrazy,-1,Tue Mar 24 13:57:05 2015 UTC,"even then, it's less the experience and more the understanding what Wollay wrote in his code. While a programming language can be learnt by many, the way you use it and write with it is wildly different per programmer."

CubeWorld,300mf0,NexasXellerk,10,Thu Apr 23 15:47:17 2015 UTC,Before the alpha he'd do this frequently.

CubeWorld,300mf0,Felixader,1 point,Mon Mar 23 17:42:16 2015 UTC,The early adopters were the ones who followed the game before launch and bought it day of the alpha's release. I honestly hope that the store comes back and the game actually gets finished but that seems like it is years away from happening.
CubeWorld,300mf0,anonymau5,1 point,Tue Mar 24 02:32:56 2015 UTC,Yeah that kinda bit me in my ass. X-P  But like Halo 3 made me wary of hype this made me wary of Alphas to purchase.   I still hope for a full release/further updates but it is still a lesson well learned.
CubeWorld,300mf0,Dicethrower,1 point,Tue Mar 24 01:39:33 2015 UTC,Awesome!!! Thanks for being nice in your email to him. A lot of people here have been spamming really shitty things to Wollay and Pixie and it's really a drag when many of us know they're still invested in the game.
CubeWorld,300mf0,Enlicx,1 point,Tue Mar 24 11:26:48 2015 UTC,"""Still working on the quest system."" Is he just trying to be the joke of the industry? The added value of this quest system is very minimal and shouldn't have taken more than a month to make, if not just a week or 2. He's been at it for years now, producing nothing. He's lazy and unmotivated, let it go. Even if we get an update in the (near) future, it's never going to make up for the time he's already taken to make it. The only reason he's still making these statements is because people are still suckered into buying it.     edit: We're almost 2 years after the last update and even that one was incredibly minor. Just look at his site      © Copyright 2014      He's even too darn lazy to update the copyright date."

Would I like to have seen more communication and progress by now?  Hell Yes.  Am I surprised? No.  So before you call the guy an arse for not changing as soon as you bought his game maybe evaluate how much research you do into a game when you support it.    Also for the comments about him ""stealing"" your money that must have been some trick for him to pry open your wallets and steal your CC info and buy his game?  You would have a better argument saying he misled you or any argument with factual support."

I am disappointed it's taking so long for development, but it is an alpha game that I believe he didn't want to release in the first place.  It's just him and his wife working on a pet project... and people kept bugging him to release it.

He numbered them, there are 15 (15 being the quest preview: https://picroma.com/blog/post/15). Some of the older blog posts on the picroma site have broken image links (https://picroma.com/blog/post/5).   So lets see 66/~24 vs. 15/~20. That's 2.75 posts a month about Cube World before the picroma site came up. Since then 0.75. That is a difference in 366%. That is fucking staggering. You want to talk history. The history claims he has completely given up. And NEVER has there been a gap of over a year until the last post. The largest gap between then was a few months. Now if we take the gap into consideration... 15/~12 ~= 1.25. That would only be about 220%.  The history argument is fucking weak. It's far from an excuse for how he has been treating paying customers. And when you look at the above, the history argument is shaky at best. He had no problem communicating about twice a month on average. So what happened?"
CubeWorld,300mf0,Lionsbane,4,Tue Mar 24 19:34:20 2015 UTC,Thank God someone out there bothered to do this. I always felt like going to such lengths to prove repeated absurd arguments wrong was not worth the effort. Maybe we could use an infographic too.
CubeWorld,300mf0,Dicethrower,3,Tue Mar 24 19:49:18 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for this post.
CubeWorld,300mf0,Lionsbane,-2,Thu Mar 26 20:37:05 2015 UTC,"No one ever looks at the timeline. They just assume that as soon as the Alpha releases some massive change is going to happen and obviously it never does.  Wollay definitely has had intention of finishing his product because he knows that his fans were super ambitious towards the start. The people who didn't look into the game more and just impulsively bought it because ""it looked fun"" or ""i was looking for an adventure"" were and still are very ignorant. If you look at his Youtube channel it shows he is a very slow developer. he did release more often, but he also had less content. He was still ""building"" the game.   If you go through the game files (I do all the time to modify models and make the adaption to weapons possible) you can find that there are actually quite a few NPCs that are still untouched. For instance the dragon? Its basically a crocodile without a connected tail and no wings. Anyway, aside from that, I'm sure developing a randomizer for quests as well as a variation of type is extremely difficult. No matter how much imagination you have, between 2 people, you will hit a dull point.  So the amount of time that he has taken for this game is extremely large compared to other games, however this is happening between 2 people, rather than several teams of highly qualified people. (Not bashing Wollay, just saying... more brains = more production)  Anyway, that's the end of my rant."

So the amount of time that he has taken for this game is extremely large compared to other games, however this is happening between 2 people, rather than several teams of highly qualified people.     You understand that people have written entire games by themselves in very small team for most of the game industry's existence? The whole indie thing used to be just the standard, a couple of people in a basement making games for fun. It wasn't until early 2000 where teams larger than a dozen were becoming the norm and the AAA market started taking it shape. People assumed that after that the indie market was done, but then notch showed up in 2007 and revived it. You can twist the facts all you want to fit your narrative, the facts remain that there's no indication they've been doing any work what so ever or have the intention to finish other than empty promises, which can easily be explained away as marketing. If they just keep saying they're still working on it, people will continue to buy it and idiots like you will still believe they'll finish it."
CubeWorld,300mf0,Lionsbane,-2,Tue Mar 24 18:39:31 2015 UTC,"Q:What do you base this on?  A:I've gotten email responses myself. He will finish when he finishes.   Q: People are ignorant for assuming developers deliver on their word?   A: If you view the time span before he released the game you'll notice large gaps between his ""announcements"" on the game. You should've taken note of that and not just assumed he would change his production rate as soon as it was released. Alphas aren't complete games yet. DayZ is a great example because at first they really weren't doing much but now that the community has spoken up and not turned against eachother, they've really picked up the pace and started releasing updates like weekly, and new versions like every 2-3months.  Q:It really shouldn't be. It should have taken him a month at worst. Don't make assumptions on topics you clearly have know clue about.  A: I've been taking computer classes in Javascript/C++/HTML for several years. I believe Cube World is written in C++ and I can say confidently I couldn't do what Wollay has done. It takes forever and if you leave and come back to something it is amazingly difficult to read. Don't assume things because it makes an ass out of you and me.  Ass+u+me = Ass out of you and me  also this is post 2000 so most games do have a team. CubeWorld is being created by 2 people. So you're supporting my theory."
CubeWorld,300mf0,GoochRash,2,Tue Mar 24 21:34:21 2015 UTC,"I can write you an email on how I'm about to cure cancer, doesn't me I am. Words are wind.  Check out my post outlining that history people love to bring up: http://www.reddit.com/r/CubeWorld/comments/300mf0/update_is_still_being_developed_stop_saying_they/cpooc18  Yes, CubeWorld is being programmed in C++. No, it isn't easy to program in. That is beside the point of what most people are irritated with. Does that excuse going a year now without saying a word publicly? Why do people have to email him to find out if he is even alive? They never even publicly said anything about the purchasing of the game being disabled? Is that not shady to you?  The difficulty of creating a game with a small team vs a large team can be debated. What can't be defended reasonably is that he hasn't said one world to us for a very long time. That is inexcusable."
CubeWorld,300mf0,ginx2666,-1,Mon Mar 23 19:48:53 2015 UTC,"I think you forget that this game is a side project in his life. He has a wife, a job, possibly had a kid or 2 since the start. It's the same excuse you use when your aunt or friend you don't like wants to visit. People claim they've shown up at his house before, but that is highly unlikely. If Wollay decided he couldn't continue or whatever that is entirely his choice to make. He doesn't owe you anything. You put your money towards a product before there was any promise. It is the same as putting money towards a business that exclusively sells telephone poles. If they do poorly than you're going to be in the hole and there is nothing you can do about it. You supported an Alpha and just because there wasn't any development you're upset. You should have been aware of the risk involved. Wollay owes no one any thing."

""Even though he told us he was going to keep updating the game, he doesn't owe us those updates. He just used that to motivate us to buy the game. That doesn't mean he should actually fulfill those promises.""  So if I buy something and it breaks in a month, that's just my fault? Not the company? It isn't bad ethics so say ""yeah, this will work for a long time"" and have it break almost right away? If steam, right now, shut their entire system down and everyone lost access to all their games we should just shrug it off? No. He does owe people the product he promised us. He has NOT delivered on what he said he was going to. On the website it says:  ""The alpha is available for a lower price than the beta version and the final version. We're planning to release updates regularly. Updates are free."" We have not received regular updates. No updates really. That is basically false advertising.  Also, it WAS his pet project. Once he sold it, it became a business. If you think it's okay to say ""I'm going to do this and this and this."" Then when people give you money and you walk away and stop talking to them. Well, then you're just a shitty person.  And then back to the basics of common decency. He can't even tell us that yes he is still working on it? You know that takes 10 seconds. He could do it while taking a shit. The respect he has shown the people that gave him money downright despicable.  Oh, and according to this:  http://www.scribd.com/doc/154812926/Cube-World-EULA#scribd  It doesn't say what we purchased is an ""as is"" product.

I'm still very hopeful because things are still seemingly positive. Wollay DID respond to several emails to a few different people (Myself included) and says he is still working towards an end product. I know most people are very doubtful and faithless but that's their problem. As a Die-Hard fan of CubeWorld I can say confidently that I believe an update will be released. The people that are upset really should have looked into the game more and now they're upset over their chore $$$ that they ""lost"" due to Wollay's ""Cash grab"" when in reality they just-so-happened to impulsively buy a fantastic game.   IMO Cube World doesn't need more content, it needs a more supportive community."

CubeWorld,304w08,Jadonson,5,Tue Mar 24 15:43:01 2015 UTC,"I just feel like Cubeworld was more exploration focused. I don't like the house mechanic in Trove or any of the building and mining. I needed an exploration game with RPG elements and Cubeworld fulfilled that need. Maybe I haven't played enough of Trove to have a legitimate opinion on it, but I think it is too objective based. And I don't like having to pay for classes but that's what you get with f2p games."
CubeWorld,304w08,Jadonson,-1,Tue Mar 24 15:52:56 2015 UTC,"Alright cool, thanks for giving me your opinion on the matter. I can agree now that it is more objective-based and leveling based than exploration. And you can buy a new class with only a couple days of playtime without the use of real money. Imo it fits better with troves style of leveling up your class and your account (mastery level). And grinding to unlock a new class and level that. Ya thanks for bringing that main playstyle / mindset difference to light."

I like the limited crafting - part of what killed Minecraft for me was all the nonsense pertaining to making things. I like the voxel aesthetic for just that - the visuals, I don't think it needs to relate into using building blocks or making things. I want to explore and hit monsters with a sword. And I can do that in Cube World. Hell, I can do that with Cube World as it is. I'm pretty content."

When people bring up history, they're talking about the amount of time between clusters of updates. When people say ""he's always been like this, look at the history"" they mean look at the time gaps between his updates before release, his biggest one was 6 months. His current absence is almost 9 months. It's an outlier, but only by 150%.I wouldn't go as far to say he has completely given up on the game from that information. I think a lot of the anger people have formed towards him have made them exaggerate the difference.  The OP of that comment, should have taken the clusters and then averaged the time between them, otherwise all Wollay needs to do, to even out that percentage, is post a lot of posts in one day to make the data look like he has the same amount of posts per month - since it only takes the average over the whole time).

The first sign that this is indeed going to be stupid and you should've just stopped while you were ahead.   The game as it is now is as polished as can be   Really? So a basic engine is polished? Right then, I've got a lot of polished games to release.   And he did actually update the game at it's release because of a bug. So we have gotten a bugfix at least. This proves that he is willing to fix bugs, or we can think that he is.   You can think day and night but no show of work says everything. A bug fix for a minor bug is one thing. It's quick, it's easy, it keeps people buying the game. An update is something else entirely.   And we know that when the expansion comes it will be so polished that it may actually slip out of our harddrives.   This just in: Any content update is now an expansion. Terraria has had a LOT of expansions and Starbound is still getting expansions! It's crazy! Why didn't we look at it like this before! Oh wait... cause they're updates. They're not expanding upon the game, they're adding to what already exists. Now if this update does include features like house building and actual content and expands upon the base systems, then it's an expansion.   Wollay is a hundred times better than EA, who releases broken video games all the time.   Yea but EA actually puts out full games so... It's really the lesser of two evils at this point and EA has Star Wars and Dead Space right now.    Many of you will think this is the stupidest thing ever, but we need something to lighten up the mood in this place.   Guys we need to lighten up the mood. So to fix that we're going to make TWENTY COUNTER THE TROLL THREADS AND TELL EVERYONE TO LEAVE BRITNEY I mean WOLLAY ALONE!

Personally, before I did it I wiped my mac's harddrive, so I could allocate even amounts of space between mac and windows (128 gb for mac and 128 gb for windows, i have a small harddrive). If you look up tutorials on how to use bootcamp it is pretty easy, because it is a service that is provided by mac. Apple does not mind allowing you to install windows, and bootcamp is provided to help you do that. The only thing is that if you accidentally fuck up the installation, it can lose the data from your harddrive, so make sure you BACK UP EVERYTHING BEFORE USING BOOTCAMP But, I have been using windows for a few months now, and it feels like the same smooth windows 7 I had on my other PC. And when installed correctly, no, it will not crash or blue screen your mac. You will just have 2 operating systems, and it will allow you to choose which operating system to use at start up by holding the alt key. When you get it working correctly though, it works great.   EDIT: This is nice understanding of it, straight from apple's website: https://www.apple.com/support/bootcamp/, but if this does not make sense for installation, youtube videos are always the most helpful source. Just make sure you have another device to watch it on while you are turning your mac off and on."

CubeWorld,2zs8nm,abucketofpuppies,3,Tue Mar 31 05:30:18 2015 UTC,"Okay, this kind of this is posted a lot. Nothing wrong with it, but ""similar"" is a very loose term when youre talking to this community. Some people think Trove is similar but that only goes as far as being visually  close in the 8-bit 3D style. At that rate you could say MineCraft is similar, but really its not.  What makes Cube World special, is the fact that it is the Legend of Zelda with the RPG structure of Diablo and other games that have a class based system.  So when people compare it to any randomly generated voxel style game it doesn't do that game or Cube World justice."
CubeWorld,2zs8nm,CynicalCouch,3,Sat Mar 21 15:25:23 2015 UTC,"I guess when I say similar I'm leaning more towards voxel games with an RPG/Adventure feel to them. I've seen people talk about Planets3, Vox, and Trove and quite a few others and was just wondering which of these were actually worth the investment."
CubeWorld,2zs8nm,Cauchemare,1 point,Sat Mar 21 17:19:13 2015 UTC,"Trove is fun, tbh. A bit imbalanced in the matter of classes, yet fun enough to waste your time in there. Give it a try someday."
CubeWorld,2zs8nm,Awsums0ss,-1,Mon Mar 23 08:41:14 2015 UTC,"Trove is pretty much a carbon copy, but with very little difference and way more content, you cant possibly compare it to minecraft on the level of similarities to Cube World, thats absurd"
CubeWorld,2zs8nm,CynicalCouch,2,Tue Mar 24 15:33:23 2015 UTC,"Trove is just another voxel building game with the added aspect of hoarding.  CubeWorld is intended as an RPG, and building isn't an aspect of game play Wollay had in mind. If housing is ever added to the game, we won't be building them one voxel at a time. Thats also why in mining is just attacking and bombing rocks.  MineCraft is pretty much the original building survival game. Closer to Trove than Cube World, even though its the only survival game of the three.  Cube World is not a building game. Its an RPG."
CubeWorld,2zs8nm,khamsouk,2,Wed Mar 25 14:45:07 2015 UTC,Have you heard of Trove? The game is also a voxel style rbg. http://www.trionworlds.com/trove/

It would be one thing if we heard updates, but with no word on the next update one of two things would happen to this sub, it either dies or we just speculate. By going with the latter you eventually turn from supporting the developer into questioning why, to finally hating that someone got you to care so much for something that is very likely not to see the light of day, or if it does it will be too late to bring back your friends to play it.

I'm going to make sure people don't trust or give money to wollay in case he ever tries shit again, be it a new game, or if he somehow gets past his autistic crippling fear of attention and work and opens the store again for cubeworld.

Check out this slightly bigger number weapon I just found, or this monster, boss, or dungeon you've seen for the thousandth time despite playing for a day.

There is no way around that. whether it is a positive or negative review.  Hope is what keeps people still on this subreddit. Wollay doesn't need to be trusted, if people want to play this game, by all means play it. For me it was not a waste of 20$ and i spent countless hours for the first month playing. I followed the development since Sept 2011 and anticipated release ever since. Even if he doesn't release it, I still had soooo much fun on it. My friends exploited glitches, the pokemon mod, modifying weapons was my favorite feature and honestly the game isn't dead. It is still fun without content.   Despite already discussing everything about the game, I still enjoy swapping items with players on another server. Running around causing mayhem. Running through caves, creating massive piles of rare loot. I have 8 characters, 1 of each race and 2 of each class with the different specialization. 4 are considered heros and 4 are considered villans. you just need some imagination.

You may think ""Oh, this is because I'm shit at this is why I keep messing up and my code looks bad"", but sorry to say that when you have enough people, a large enough project, a CEO or exec that suddenly wants a goddamn feature that you didn't plan for, the code needs to change to accommodate it, and it's NEVER clean.  Even if you think you designed a foolproof system, and somehow have developers that all follow the same coding style exactly, and by some miracle have managed to avoid all feature creep, you're still going to be encountering more bugs as you progress in your design.

CubeWorld,2zfc29,Jezzdit,5,Wed Mar 18 09:40:56 2015 UTC,"Nobody knows. Personally, I think he gave up on working on it and ran, but if an update comes, I'll happily admit I was wrong.  After I finish playing it."
CubeWorld,2zfc29,TheFinalPancake,3,Fri Mar 20 16:04:17 2015 UTC,sad bois sad life
CubeWorld,2zfc29,CynicalCouch,0,Wed Mar 18 03:54:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is because Wollay has no intention of updating it anymore."
CubeWorld,2zfc29,Yorn2,-1,Wed Mar 18 17:27:38 2015 UTC,k
CubeWorld,2z50u7,MrSlowbro,14,Sun Mar 15 17:18:15 2015 UTC,There is no legitimate way to purchase it right now. The only way to get it at this point in time is to pirate it.
CubeWorld,2z50u7,bobrocks,2,Sun Mar 15 17:24:30 2015 UTC,Thank goodness....not saying it is a waste of money but I would much rather have 20$ or whatever worth of doritoes at this point
CubeWorld,2z50u7,TmPeanut,-1,Sun Mar 15 22:00:48 2015 UTC,Don't. Just have somebody send you the game. It's not like you would be stealing it.  The guy stole money and dilivered nothing so no need to give him more.
CubeWorld,2z50u7,Dormage,1 point,Sun Mar 15 17:22:29 2015 UTC,"""Stole""  Let's all stop acting so entitled, you probably played your 20$ dollars worth."
CubeWorld,2z50u7,Dingus_Milo,8,Sun Mar 15 17:42:04 2015 UTC,"Agree, lets stop acting. He promised regular updates. The price payed included future updates that never came. This is indisputably a rip off."
CubeWorld,2z50u7,Dormage,2,Sun Mar 15 17:44:01 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it is a rip off. I know of games out there that cost more and offer little and they are finished.   EQ when it first came out offered little in the way of quests, level cap 50 some crafting (expensive as there was a chance to fail on creating something) and you ran everywhere on foot, if you were unlucky and couldn't find a port.  When that game was released it was 60$ and a monthly fee of 15$.  I don't recall him ever using the word promise and up to a point there was regular updates however, there is no idea on what is happening.  For all we know he could be dead, or something nearly as terrible."
CubeWorld,2z50u7,Fizbanic,7,Sun Mar 15 18:08:58 2015 UTC,Just because you compare it to other games doesn't lessen the fact it's still an undelivered game.
CubeWorld,2z50u7,asharwood,0,Mon Mar 16 02:49:04 2015 UTC,Obviously this sub has reached the point where it cannot support a reasonable debate anymore. This topic was revisited many times and for some reason there is an angry mob on this sub that refuses to see reason and logic and will do anything to bury anything negative about this game even tho besides the game it self everything is negative.  Nobody ever said they didn't get enough for their money. It was always about the fail to deliver promised things to the enormous community. People asked him to open source it if he has no ambition to develop it further.  He refused all suggestions that would at least in part bring some satisfaction to the community.  So this is clearly another of those early access rip offs even if it was not intended. I fail to see the reason to hang out here anymore so I'm leaving the sub Thank you all for a few wonderful posts over the past two years and enjoy lingering on..  P.S. They say hope dies last but don't get fooled the one who hopes dies last.
CubeWorld,2z50u7,Dormage,-3,Mon Mar 16 19:19:12 2015 UTC,I don't think he promised anything.
CubeWorld,2z50u7,NotEthosLab,6,Sun Mar 15 18:28:49 2015 UTC,It says regular updates on the god damn website.
CubeWorld,2z50u7,GoochRash,4,Sun Mar 15 19:43:06 2015 UTC,"You can't be fucking serious, right? By that same logic I am a 'regular' attendee to everywhere I've ever been, even if only once, because the period of my regularity is undefined. Sounds pretty fucking stupid when it's put like that isn't it."
CubeWorld,2yrptr,Blubbll,4,Thu Mar 12 06:27:08 2015 UTC,Whats the server Adresse? I would like to vist your server

CubeWorld,2yrptr,ilandprnce,1 point,Thu Mar 12 20:55:13 2015 UTC,Okay :) As long as it is not pvp. I got really tired of lvl 2000 players killing me all the time. Does the server adjust all the castles etc to the highest or lowest player?
CubeWorld,2yrptr,mearsy101,2,Thu Mar 12 21:01:48 2015 UTC,"Idk, they will be balanced to medium / normal i think"
CubeWorld,2yrptr,TheAntiHick,1 point,Fri Mar 13 06:17:48 2015 UTC,This awnsers my question... Did the server go down a while back?

CubeWorld,2yrptr,mearsy101,1 point,Thu Mar 12 21:46:53 2015 UTC,"Yes it is, modded though with ddl injections.  And sorry about the desync happening, i can't control it or get an alert to restart the server cluster and all it's services in time when this happens as it is a Cubeworld issue, not windows."
CubeWorld,2yrptr,TheAntiHick,1 point,Thu Mar 12 21:38:39 2015 UTC,"Sweet! I think I'll hop back on then as I loved the game... I believe I'm level 600 something because of how ""if someone beats the boss everyone gets xp"""

CubeWorld,2yrptr,JerkFairy,1 point,Thu Mar 12 22:20:43 2015 UTC,I think there will be a Cubeworld update this summer. I'll instantly upgrade the Servers when the upgrade arrives :)
CubeWorld,2yrptr,JerkFairy,2,Thu Mar 12 21:52:56 2015 UTC,"I think there will be a Cubeworld update this summer   Based on what, exactly? Because unless you have some information that no one else has seen, this is an extremely misleading thing to say."
CubeWorld,2yrptr,JerkFairy,-1,Thu Mar 12 21:54:10 2015 UTC,"Based on bi-yearly update cycle :D  jk, i think he updates us with new information / small game updates once a year, even 2014 was full of posts and videos by him"
CubeWorld,2yrptr,JerkFairy,0,Fri Mar 13 05:39:29 2015 UTC,"It's been a year and eight months since the alpha came out, and a year and eight months since there was an update.  You can ""think"" that all you want, but it's wrong."

CubeWorld,2yt5um,natnip,7,Thu Mar 12 16:39:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is anywhere you can buy it at the moment, the easiest thing to do would be to torrent it, which is what I had to do, I only found out about it around December"
CubeWorld,2yt5um,Perezian,2,Thu Mar 12 17:06:58 2015 UTC,"By torrenting it, you are not able to play multiplayer. Thought this was necessary to mention."

CubeWorld,2yt5um,Mehixan,3,Thu Mar 12 19:14:50 2015 UTC,You could prolly ask for someone to just give you their account so you can download it. Not a lot of people are very fond of the way things have turned out is why.
CubeWorld,2yt5um,ButteredToasts,3,Thu Mar 12 16:43:53 2015 UTC,Don't buy it and bother supporting Wollay until he at least updates it once more. Just get a torrent of it.
CubeWorld,2yt5um,DEDMON,4,Mon Mar 16 22:31:52 2015 UTC,You don't buy it. Wollay doesn't deserve any more support or money. I would never suggest you pay for it. Torrent the fucking thing and be done with it.
CubeWorld,2yt5um,Kingmudsy,2,Mon Mar 23 05:26:54 2015 UTC,"They haven't updated the game in over a year, best to wait for hell to freeze over before buying it!"
CubeWorld,2yt5um,MooseKnocker,6,Thu Mar 12 16:44:08 2015 UTC,"They haven't updated since July 2013, so closer to 2 years now."
CubeWorld,2yt5um,TheFinalPancake,2,Sun Mar 15 18:23:24 2015 UTC,Why would you want to?
CubeWorld,2yt5um,TheFinalPancake,0,Fri Mar 13 10:28:56 2015 UTC,"Regardless of it's lack of updates, it's still a good game. If it wasn't, nobody would have bought it in the first place."
CubeWorld,2yt5um,TheFinalPancake,-5,Mon Mar 16 16:20:25 2015 UTC,"No, it's not a good game. There's a complete lack of direction, all the ""quests"" revolve around killing fucking monsters and that's it.   The game is a massive grind, the equipment system is a joke, the stats are totally unbalanced. And it completely lacks any creative energy unlike Minecraft or Trove."
CubeWorld,2yt5um,TheFinalPancake,7,Mon Mar 23 05:28:23 2015 UTC,"A complete lack of direction is the point, it's exploring, I don't want a text box dictating to me that I have to go to a certain dungeon, collect a certain item and kill a certain mob a set ammount of times before I can level up. That would remove the entire ""free-roaming"" aspect of the game.   The game is a massive grind   Like every other RPG, you mean.  I don't see how the equipment system is a joke, it seems solid to me - three kinds of weapons for each class, each weapon varying in speed and damage. Different armor for different classes also makes sense - you don't want to be wearing armor made of silk if the main source of damage you will be taking is from swords.  The unbalaced stats mean nothing. ""My friend can kill this boss 12% more effectively than me, he needs a nerf or I need a buff!"" In a PvE game like Cube World, balance matters far less than in a PvP game like CoD. Don't argue that Cube World is a PvP game too - that's a plugin on a couple of servers, developed by the community. It hadn't been added by the dev, and is therefore invalid.  An adventure RPG doesn't need 'creative energy' because you don't create anything like you do in Minecraft or Trove, with the exception of weapon customization.  Also, avoid replying to week-old posts. I don't think it's against the rules, but it's kind of annoying."
CubeWorld,2yt5um,Blubbll,-6,Mon Mar 23 17:15:06 2015 UTC,"You can try to argue your point any way you want, but the fact is, Cube World is shit.  Back when the hype was extreme and the web site was crashing because so many people were trying to buy the game, I bought into the hype and bought the game and I was sadly disappointed.  Once you start seeing parts of the game, there's no reason to continue to explore. There's no driving force to make the players want to explore. The quests are all the same and the system is designed in a manner that, the quests aren't more then so far away so you don't have to walk for  hours.  Maybe if the terrain was fully destructible, maybe if there was more resource collecting then killing monsters, maybe if there was actual dungeons, maybe if I could choose to build a house anywhere I wanted to, maybe I'd actually want to go out and explore.  The combat mechanics are completely unbalanced. The game is supposed to give you hints on what monsters you can and cannot handle and yet as I was playing, I was finding myself running into monsters 10 levels below my own, still completely destroying me with spell casting.  The equipment is a fucking joke, the utter lack of finding suitable gear really doesn't start to sink in until you realize that you've out leveled your gear by 5 or even 10 levels. Then when you actually start looking for new stuff, you suddenly realize, this is it, there isn't anything more.  Don't get me started on the asinine upgrading system that Wollay put into place. Collecting platinum coins to actually bring gear up to a level you can use is so unbalanced that you are going to constantly discover you are leveling at too fast of a rate (causing the cost of upgrading going up even further) to actually keep up with the coins.  The equipment enchantment system is also fucking terrible. If it wasn't bad enough you have to make sure you have all the same elements, you have to make sure they are the same level. I mean Jesus Christ, has Wolly thought any of this out at all?  Exploring is one thing, wandering around, with nothing to do, with the same bullshit for hours is another. This game should have been a playground and it's not. Wollay took the MOST SIMPLEST ideas from some games he enjoyed and made an attempt to incorporate it into a voxel environment and he failed horribly.    There's plenty of sand box style games, that allow you to do what you want, as you want, how you want, but still manages to actually deliver story line, new gameplay mechanics and a sense of exploration, not just because you want to, but you need to, to progress.   Not every RPG is built the same, sure, when you boil down all the elements, every RPG is based on numbers and grinding. But it's how you do it, how you deliver the story and how players feel about it that changes that feeling. There's a reason why I've played games like Chrono Trigger, EarthBound, Fallout, Fallout 2, Fallout 3 and Skyrim over and over, because it's not fucking boring.   Go fuck yourself, there's something wrong with you, if you can sit there and honestly try to defend this weak pile of steaming horse shit, either you are autistic or some kind of fucking shill. The reality is that better games have gotten WORSE criticism (StarBound) and still offer infinitely more then this god damn game.     I hope the reason why there hasn't been an update is because something horrible happened to Wollay in his life, like getting dick cancer and having his cock fall off, because that son of a bitch deserves it for selling this game in the state it was and then running off. If I met him at a convention or on the street I'd do my best to beat the shit out of him, take his wallet and any money he had in it, because he did that to anyone who bought this fucking cunt game."
CubeWorld,2ywfj1,Blubbll,8,Fri Mar 13 11:37:03 2015 UTC,"Well, its in alpha, i don't know what someone would expect releasing their content unprotected like that. Really I don't see where your proof is that people have been breaking down this game and publishing it, you really need to support claims like that, especially when everyone is complaining about how balls hard it is to add content to this game for the very reason its so difficult to break down.  I definitely get he could be discouraged by the swarm of randgenerated games coming out but with the success of minecraft this was going to happen anyways.  If he didn't want people cheating, he should have added a anti-cheat system, simple as that. For those of us who purchased the game, we bought the right as well to exploit the gameplay how we'd like."
CubeWorld,2ywfj1,CynicalCouch,-5,Fri Mar 13 12:07:27 2015 UTC,"With the decompiling and custom building material of those data i actually mean the cuwo-project, glydar and any other projects that get every aspect of the coding and write an answer for it, release it and play with it like generating custom chunks tuples & blocks or block clusters and entities, which all is forbidden by the EULA.  I would kinda get angry if people de-assemble a project of me and publish modified versions that do something completely different that i intended.  Just like the PvP, which wollay planned to bring aswell, then cuwo came and stole this feature and published it, taking away the project itself from wollay."
CubeWorld,2ywfj1,mattymck,1 point,Fri Mar 13 12:14:30 2015 UTC,No one needed to decompile his code. Voxels have existed for a long time and there really isnt anything new about cubeworld.

CubeWorld,2ywfj1,Darkersun,3,Fri Mar 13 14:08:20 2015 UTC,"Without source the game code is complete gibberish and is near impossible to decompile, the clones like most other things came after his complete absence and generally just show him up.  As for pressure, he brought it upon himself. He used a standard marketing strategy to get his game known (hype) and generate the most sales possible. Everything you mentioned is all his fault, most people have gotten over the lack of updates and simply want him to explain his absence. A simple paragraph would do but Wollay being Wollay he has to ignore absolutely everyone for no reason whatsoever. There is zero reason for him to not explain even the simple things.  As a side note I'm pretty convinced Wollay is either autistic or has some form of mental disability that stops him from explaining. I'm not trying to be rude but there isn't anything else that can really stop him from saying; ""Yes I took your money and there will be no more development for cubeworld."" Even that would do."
CubeWorld,2ywfj1,Darkersun,1 point,Fri Mar 13 13:20:29 2015 UTC,he's narcissistic about the subject  his game IS fun...
CubeWorld,2ywfj1,AfroToast43,2,Fri Mar 13 13:51:33 2015 UTC,"You idea would be good...  If Wollay made ANY indication that these things drove him to stop developing the game.   He has literally made no mention of these things either positively or negatively in any context. If he had, you would have linked them as proof.   Its just as likely Wollay got bored and stopped working since he already made some decent money off of the game."

CubeWorld,2yoz0u,kidbackstab,9,Wed Mar 11 21:52:39 2015 UTC,"Don't listen to the people of this subreddit.   I think it's safe to say that a good majority of the people here are not game devs. And I am certainly not a dev myself. But nobody who complains has any idea how long it takes to develop a game, let alone one as ambitious as this game with such a tiny team.   All anyone does anymore is spew hate and insults at wollay, and trash on this game. But every single one of them is going to be doing nothing but praising this game when wollay puts it out complete.   As for me, I still have nothing but hope and time. And if I'm wrong, so what. I'm out $10 bucks. But I can feel content in knowing that I at the very least gave my money to someone who wanted to make something great."
CubeWorld,2yoz0u,KiljoyAU,7,Thu Mar 12 05:33:27 2015 UTC,"As a game dev, I think this was a terrible way to go about this - from what I understand Wollay either took a ton of money and ran or refuses to hire anyone with the obscene money he's received to expedite the process.  It's a matter of credibility, too - if he would at least say ""I'm still working"" once every 3 or so months, that'd be a whole different thing than a lack of updates for going on 2 years now."
CubeWorld,2yoz0u,Pengwertle,1 point,Thu Mar 12 07:05:10 2015 UTC,"For the record, I don't disagree with you about how he should have handled it. But I can't speak on how it is currently being handled. Only that I still think that it is being worked on.   And as for credibility, why would he want to keep talking to a community that does nothing but complain and hurl insults? Even when he was still communicating, people jumped down his throat that stuff wasn't being done fast enough or good enough. It was terrible. I don't blame him for cutting contact at all.   Every time. I come to this sub, I can't talk about how I'm still excited for this game and that I still think it's being worked on without people telling me I'm an idiot for thinking so, or that wollay is a liar and thief. I get berated for defending him like he's some sort of monster. I'm just a fan of this game and I already want to cut contact with this community, imagine how wollay feels."
CubeWorld,2yoz0u,kidbackstab,0,Wed Mar 11 17:50:21 2015 UTC,"One small difference, we didn't all give you a bunch of money to deliver a product. If you bought a couch off Craiglist and then the person selling the couch was taking a really long time to build it for you and wouldn't give you any updates, you'd understandably get frustrated. You may even get angry at the couch seller. That doesn't mean the couch seller is within rights to just ignore you and not give you the couch that you've paid them for.  It's not a perfect analogy but I'm sure you get the point.  Also, Woolay has a blog where he can post updates with comments turned off so he can keep his customers informed without having to deal with them being mean. He hasn't done this. After 9 months, it's not unreasonable for his customers to assume he has either ran off with their money with no intention to finish."
CubeWorld,2yoz0u,Sephar,3,Thu Mar 12 04:31:40 2015 UTC,"It doesn't have anything to do with how long the game is taking. There are plenty of games which take a long time to develop, especially open world, ambitious stuff like this. The thing is, Wollay has not only tremendously failed to communicate in almost any way, shape or form for months, he has also shut down the official forums. This tells a lot of people that it isn't just lack of communication, it's intentional suppression of complaints. Whether or not this is true, people expect some sort of word from Wollay, and if you think that they aren't entitled to a blog post every month, that is your opinion. It doesn't change what everyone else thinks."
CubeWorld,2yoz0u,ColinStyles,1 point,Thu Mar 12 12:51:25 2015 UTC,"I actually agree with you about the time it's taking being long. I mean, I don't mind myself. But I completely agree that it is a long time regardless.  But here's how I look at it: You're a fledgling game dev who has somehow stumbled onto what seems to be a perfect formula for a game, and your Kickstarter is a massive success. So many people, way more than you thought you'd get at such an early time. Follow that up with early access purchase for those that want to support the project. People seem super excited, and all the game journalism outlets are going bananas over your game, adding to the hype. Sure, there are people who grumble about bugs, or that stuff isn't getting put out fast enough. But that's okay, it's healthy to have a bit of criticism.   But slowly, the complaints get louder, and louder. Suddenly, every person who donated of purchased feel like they own you. They feel like what they have to say is the most important thing. Now people are getting outright mad at you. Why aren't you updating the game faster? I gave you my money, why aren't you listening to me?   Now, imagine that the complaints turn to anger. And the anger turns into insults. Insults into fanatic rage. Why are people getting so angry at you? There's so many of them, and there's only one of you. You can't put out content fast enough to stop people from being upset. Every time you try and update people on Twitter or your blog, people just yell at you that you're not doing enough, or that it's not fast enough. What are you doing with all that money, anyways? This is ridiculous, with all that money, you should be done with the game by now.   Suddenly, every single interaction you have with the community is just toxic. There's no feedback, there's nothing constructive. It's just hundreds of thousands people who are mad at you, bombarding you all the time. All you want to do is to make the game, why are people so upset with you?  Now. How long would you be able to last until you decided that enough was enough. That it's better to quietly work on the game than it is to let anyone know how it was going? I don't know about you, but I don't blame wollay one bit."

If you're just gonna yell, nobody is gonna take you seriously.  Now. If you think that he took the money and ran, you're allowed to have the opinion. And that's fine. But I'm also allowed to have my opinion that he didn't do that, and that he's still working on the game.   See, isn't the world a wonderful place? Full of different people who have different ideas and thoughts, all sharing this crazy blue marble in space together."
CubeWorld,2yoz0u,Yakkahboo,10,Fri Mar 13 20:26:45 2015 UTC,"Just to throw this out there, I am a game dev, and my team is slumping into Wollays boots.   The harder you work on something and the more passionate you are about something, the less you can find time to inform people of your progress.   Its just one of those things.   By no means is it excusable though, and I for one try my hardest to stay in touch with our kickstarter backers and others involved in our community site, but we need to give Wollay some slack, he very well could be(and I believe is) developing his heart out.  At the end of the day, he was working on CW for 2 years before we saw it, so it might be another 2 before we see something again.  We just cant know."
CubeWorld,2yoz0u,ColinStyles,9,Fri Mar 13 20:42:44 2015 UTC,"Uh, yeah, no.  First off, the more you work on a game the easier it is to talk about it, given you have all this progress and new things to talk about.  Second, you don't take down your only method of sales for any reason ever.  The fact that people still believe in this shit is pathetic.  It's one guy who had a hobby he got bored of, so he sold it and ran.  Done."
CubeWorld,2yoz0u,Yakkahboo,1 point,Fri Mar 13 20:51:12 2015 UTC,"Well, considering I didnt mention that the difficulty in talking was the amount of content...     The fact that people still believe in this is irrelevant.   What do people actually lose out on by wanting to think he's still developing btw?  Is it just a case of ""I told you so""?"
CubeWorld,2yoz0u,Lionsbane,3,Wed Mar 11 20:19:01 2015 UTC,"It's a problem because it encourages other people to excuse his bullshit and possibly give him money if the store opens up again.  It's also a bad mentality to have because it means you learned nothing from the experience, whereas if you admit you got screwed you will probably be a little more suspicious of early access in the future."
CubeWorld,2yoz0u,HIs4HotSauce,0,Fri Mar 13 20:19:22 2015 UTC,"That's fair point, but its one thing to say that people should learn from this experience, it's another to go around calling people pathetic.  But just because someone hasn't completely given up on the game doesn't mean they their opinions on early access haven't changed.   I've come out of this experience a lot more wary of games, but it doesn't mean I don't want to the product to go unfinished."
CubeWorld,2yoz0u,Lionsbane,-2,Fri Mar 13 20:53:39 2015 UTC,"I'm right there with you, but it truly is a little pathetic.   Wollay lost his hype and because of that the game is basically dead. Even if he does update the game, his fan base isn't as big as it once was. you could tell in the Early on development in his videos that he was indecisive about how he wanted the game. The HUD and GUI changed multiple times, and even in his latest video he has changed how quests work.  Ultimately what I'm saying is that I think the dude can't make up his mind on how he wants to the game to be produced. It had massive potential, he squandered that. he put out bugfixes on like the 2nd day, and several months later a video on quests. Besides that he basically fell off the earth."
CubeWorld,2yoz0u,Tramd,2,Fri Mar 13 23:24:53 2015 UTC,Well at this rate we'll have another gaming technology leap before CW is done. Then most everybody will move onto the next big thing and forget about the game that used technology from years ago.
CubeWorld,2yoz0u,kidbackstab,1 point,Sat Mar 14 01:33:08 2015 UTC,"I agree with you 100%, but I've been following this game for almost 4years now and check this reddit like every month or so. My hope is gone.  However, do keep in mind when looking at the timeline. Wollay releases one thing every 6 months or so. Also watch the website/YouTube channels for the videos he posts. I was psyched when he released the video for new quests, but its been a while since that was posted.  Either way, I do think the game is dead. And even if it isn't dead I still wouldn't play it because of the hype being gone. I have already had 5-9 characters that I've gotten to level 60+ and its the same game... Idk... I wouldn't wait around for this game though."
CubeWorld,2yoz0u,Tramd,-7,Sat Mar 14 14:01:50 2015 UTC,Ya I doubt that. At this point you would have to be a complete idiot to have any faith in it. Even if it does get finished the pooch has been screwed. It will forever be remembered as what it could have been. Perfect example being that other game that looks exactly like cube world and has its Dev regularly posting to twitter.   Defend that.
CubeWorld,2yoz0u,kidbackstab,2,Wed Mar 11 23:58:01 2015 UTC,"There are still plenty of people who have faith in this game. Don't assume that just because you lost faith that it makes people who still have it a ""complete idiot"". It's exactly that kind of bullying and negativity that caused wollay to cut contact with the community.   Second, games get copied all the time. Every game that has any sort of significance to gamers will have at least a few. Look at all the Minecraft clones. And if you're talking about Trove, that game was announced around the same time at Cube World, and has a whole studio behind it. As far as I know, Picroma is just wollay and his wife.   Third, putting ""Defend that."" at the end doesn't make you sound as cool as you think. Be a better person than that."
CubeWorld,2yoz0u,Tramd,-1,Sat Mar 14 13:54:54 2015 UTC,"It's exactly that kind of bullying and negativity that caused wollay to cut contact with the community.   Really? How exactly do you know that? Because from what I remember it didn't take anything for him to cut contact from the community. Implying there ever really was any to begin with.   The game I was referring to was giawa. As far as I know, it's just him. The point has nothing to do with games being copied."
CubeWorld,2yoz0u,kidbackstab,0,Wed Mar 11 19:29:42 2015 UTC,"Well, you're wrong. Wollay was plenty active with the community as a whole (not just this sub), and then people started demanding that things be done faster, or better, etc. And it got to the point that he simply cut contact rather than put up with the abuse that he was getting. These are facts. And they don't stop being facts just because you choose to ignore them.  And I've never heard of Giawa before. It looks like a very fun game for being an almost exact clone of Cube World. But that doesn't negate the point I'm attempting to impress upon you."
CubeWorld,2yoz0u,Tramd,-2,Wed Mar 11 20:21:40 2015 UTC,Is that what happened? Is that a fact? You seem to know an awful lot otherwise it would be pretty silly to speculate and apologise for something that is deplorable in any way you look at it.   I mean all I see is a dude who stopped bothering to update anything. That's all. I mean you're defending and apologising for this guy as if this game hasn't fallen off the face of the earth.

CubeWorld,2ynujy,Dormage,3,Wed Mar 11 10:54:29 2015 UTC,"Roles! By roles I mean the role a class plays in a team.   Tank, support, dmg dealer and so on..  As for the thread question: I loved the crafting system as an idea but hated the fact it didn't work. The fact you could change the shape of your weapon introduced a mini-game in the game. Problem was the shapes and materials didn't reflect on stats and power in general. Plus it's always a good idea to have visual improvements on items users have crafted or enhanced mainly for getting noticed and awarded for the work you've done.  Cube World had awesome pets it needs more features but its an awesome Pokemon like idea that worked well.  I'd like Bosses that actually drop very useful stuff. Since your game is more MMO style I'd like to have a mall system but virtual currency only no pay 2 win stuff. In order for virtual currency to have value NPC's need to sell useful stuff.  I missed gems in CW. I like combining gems in a exponential way. You make a lvl 3 gem by combining two lvl gems which were made by combining two lvl 1 gems for each... Making lvl 6 gems is really hard and expensive so currency gains value. Also, gem level needs to influence visuals...  PVP arena :)  There is so much that can be done ..."

CubeWorld,2ynujy,frisch85,5,Wed Mar 11 10:53:04 2015 UTC,The simplicity and the combat style. It's a good game that you can just hop into with your friends and fight off some mobs while gaining levels.  A more indepth skill system would be nice tho it's kind of boring that every class has only 2 choices of playstyle and one choice being inferior to the other.
CubeWorld,2ynujy,Hex_Destroyer,2,Wed Mar 11 10:52:34 2015 UTC,"Light progression for grinding on mobs is great to have, good observation."
CubeWorld,2ynujy,PuddlesTheGreat,3,Wed Mar 11 10:55:17 2015 UTC,"Cube World didn't seem to have a big focus on building, did anyone miss that?"
CubeWorld,2ynujy,ChunkArcade,2,Wed Mar 11 10:56:53 2015 UTC,"You couldn't build at all. Only thing was improving weapons with the little crystals. Didn't matter tho because it's purpose was being an ARPG in voxel style. If you check trove for example, that game is way to complicated. With all the crafting and building and gardening. Then there's fishing (implemented yet? Didn't play for couple of months) and such. It's fine allowing the player to build or craft but on the other hand the player should not be forced to do that in order to get the best/strongest character.  If you plan on putting a lot of focus on building/crafting/enchanting/whatever, i highly recommend implementing a trading system. There should be a very good balance between crafters and adventurers which is normally very hard to achive. One way of this would be to implement a ""on skill use""-progression type. Like the more you swing your sword on a mob, the better your fighting capabilities will be. The more you smith, the higher your smithing level gets. Top end gear needs the highest smithing level while on the other hand top end mobs (which also drop the required mats for the best crafted items) require really good fighting skills.  For this you could check out the progression system in the original Ultima Online. Gotta say that game is very old but it's still one of the most interesting MMORPGs imo."

It's about adventuring off into new lands, and leaving others behind. Crafting portable equipment is a nice and fun feature but it isn't supposed to be Minecraft."

I absolutely love the combat in Cube World, it's often very intense and the boss fights can take up to 20 minutes at higher levels, even with friends. It's very skill based and rewards reacting quickly, backing out to heal, etc. As opposed to the button mashing that is the combat in games like Minecraft."

I love seeing your enthusiasm for developing it and it really gives me high hopes for the game! :) (Do more streams on twitch!)  Now onto Cube world... What attracted me to it the most was probably the art style. It was simple, yet beautiful. Just different shades of whole colours on voxels, no real textures or anything. I also enjoyed the open world environment and how you could level your character. That brings me to another point. Starting off was tough, but in a way, it was comically funny. You'd be screaming as you run for your life from a Skull Bull.   I guess in the end, it was a game that I wanted to believe would get better with time, but the chances of that ever happening now is pretty much nill."

CubeWorld,2xg9b3,Cosmic2,5,Sat Feb 28 11:27:24 2015 UTC,You can play it through private servers with Hamachi. One of my friends torrented it and was able to join me on my paid copy through Hamachi.
CubeWorld,2xg9b3,DrVolzak,0,Sat Feb 28 15:14:32 2015 UTC,Or just port forward if you have access to the router CP. Saves everyone having to download software.
CubeWorld,2xg9b3,Cosmic2,2,Sat Feb 28 20:19:03 2015 UTC,Yea but I was talking about how to play it with friends who torrented it.
CubeWorld,2xg9b3,DrVolzak,0,Sun Mar 1 00:12:56 2015 UTC,"Port forwarding lets you play with the same people Hamachi does, and more, since no one has to have Hamachi installed."
CubeWorld,2xg9b3,Cosmic2,1 point,Sun Mar 1 02:10:25 2015 UTC,Yes but in most games you can't play with people who torrent the game. But using Hamachi to play lan matches online skips the authentication. I'm just saying that most torrented games won't let you play with friends port forwarding or not. And I'm not sure if that's the case with cube world or not.
CubeWorld,2xg9b3,DrVolzak,0,Sun Mar 1 04:25:51 2015 UTC,"Hamachi doesn't ""crack"" the game. If a game doesn't check for authentication/key/ownership in LAN, then either Hamachi or port forwarding will work. Port forwarding is not exactly LAN though, it's more like it allows other people to connect to your IP (because your ISP/router doesn't allow that by default for security reasons.) Then people can just type in your IP and join your server. It's easier and I recommend you look into it. But if you don't mind Hamachi, then that's okay.  I haven't played Cube World in a very long time but I believe Port Forwarding worked just fine on there. An example of a game it works on is Diablo II."
CubeWorld,2xg9b3,Cosmic2,1 point,Sun Mar 1 05:16:37 2015 UTC,"I at no point implied that Hamachi would ""crack"" any game... And I said you may not need to use it for Cube World.   If a game doesn't check for authentication/key/ownership in LAN, then either Hamachi or port forwarding will work.   False. Port forwarding has absolutely nothing to do with LAN. Port forwarding opens ports allowing connections through, thus allowing people to host servers for games that require certain ports be opened. LAN however disregards security set on ports as the two computers are connected on the same network. Hamachi fakes this connection online.  The point of all this is that with most torrented games, you are unable to play online due to not having a registered copy/account. Port forwarding will open your ports, yes. But you cannot play a torrented copy of a game such as Borderlands through online servers, open ports or not. This is where hamachi comes into play. You are no longer trying to broadcast a server online that checks with the DRM of the game that each player is using a registered copy. Instead it goes through a virtual LAN connection skipping the authentication."

CubeWorld,2xg9b3,ColinStyles,-2,Sat Feb 28 11:29:08 2015 UTC,The game is not officially dead. Its just that the developer has been scilent for a very long time. But the fact that they are making changes to the website suggests to me that something is going on. Wollay has previously shown some videos on the new questing system he has been working on.
CubeWorld,2xg9b3,Glassle,10,Sat Feb 28 11:32:52 2015 UTC,"The site isn't getting changes, it's degrading.

CubeWorld,2xg9b3,Martanz,-2,Sun Mar 1 14:10:58 2015 UTC,"I heard (not sure how true this is) that Wollay was given a job as a Minecraft dev. If this is the case, chances are he's abandoned the game. If not, he either got bored, or is very slow at bringing out updates. A lot of people around this sub have said that because the Alpha works so well despite it just being an Alpha, they think that Wollay is a perfectionist and doesn't want to give us anything until he is completely happy that there are no bugs. That still doesn't explain the fact that the store is down though"

I mean, it sounds pretty awful the way he talks about it."" Well I searched it up and got caught up in the idea that was a game of pure adventure. No stupid plot, no restrictions on roaming, possible multiplayer, and to top it all off it reminded me of all the classic video games I was raised on. Especially Zelda.

I saw minecraft grow out of beta, so I thought that the same development would happen to Cube World.   I paid €15. I don't regret paying it, I just think it's a shame that it isn't being continued even at a slow rate. I had good fun playing it with friends and stuff, but I just don't feel like I want to play it again. Same feeling I have to other games which I stop playing."

He was here all the time, making posts and communicating, and then we alienated him.  That's exactly how it went down.  The dude's store has been down for over two months, and even if there were a legitimate way to buy it I would never recommend someone spend 20 dollars on a demo."

CubeWorld,2wykso,Glassle,0,Tue Feb 24 14:30:14 2015 UTC,He completely missed the fact that I was sarcastically replying to someone who suggested that Wollay used to communicate with us but now doesn't because we alienated him.  It's really not that hard to see if you read through the comments.
CubeWorld,2wykso,TheAntiHick,2,Tue Feb 24 15:15:37 2015 UTC,"No he didn't. There's nothing that implies that he missed that fact. His comment has nothing to do with that, he was just arguing that we shouldn't expect communication in the first place. I don't agree with him, but he definitely didn't miss your sarcasm."
CubeWorld,2wykso,Glassle,0,Tue Feb 24 15:35:26 2015 UTC,So he accused me of having the idea that Wollay should be here communicating with us...based on my sarcastic response to someone who seems to think that's exactly what Wollay did in the past...and he got the sarcasm?

It would be cool if we got an update, but there are literally hundreds of thousands of other games to play.

CubeWorld,2wmaae,baylin101,13,Sat Feb 21 04:31:59 2015 UTC,"Serious questions are not for humorous threads, but I'll explain.  Basically, it depends on one question: Are you prepared to get it illegally?  If no:  You can't.  If yes:  Find a torrenting website.  Don't even feel bad about stealing the game - Wollay clearly doesn't care enough about the game to even post on his twitter, let alone update it or do something about people torrenting."

To admit inadequacy -- even in jest -- is incomprehensible.""  ""Objective criticism isn't given or received easily. Compliments are seldom given for work product.""  This is why wollay literally will not respond to criticism, but will willingly reply to questions like 'how are you?' it just bounces off of his skin."
CubeWorld,2wmrts,Natedog731,19,Sat Feb 21 05:58:56 2015 UTC,There's a difference between 'giving up' and no longer caring.  There's far better games out there now that have taken up where CW left off.  Whatever he does eventually release will now be behind everyone else.
CubeWorld,2wmrts,NonBritGit,8,Sat Feb 21 16:31:38 2015 UTC,"Indie game subreddits tend to over-state the desires and numbers of people willing to put up with developers who either abandon projects or continually promise what they can't deliver in terms of features or timelines.  Players who get fed up are more likely to just leave the subreddit, leaving it far over-represented by white knights and apologists who will wait forever on nothing more than promises of hugs and kisses.  For a while, the catchphrase tends to be ""I trust the developers"".  When trust no longer feels compelling, the stale comback tends to be ""it's early access"" as if early access absolves someone of the responsibilities to customers once they start taking peoples' money.  When that gets old, it's ""hope"".  Welcome to hope.  Hope really isn't good enough because many of us didn't buy the game hoping it would be done at some time in a random future.  Many of us bought it with the understanding that we'd have something complete and compelling before all of our friends gave up on it.  At this point, even if it were completed, it's still a failure for me because I didn't buy it to play with the 100 strangers who still care about it in 2018.  Quit making excuses for Wollay, he's the one who chose to enter the Early Access program to start taking in money.  Nobody forced him to."
CubeWorld,2wmrts,Delusionn,3,Mon Feb 23 21:33:19 2015 UTC,"Haha, well said.  Sounds like the 5 stages of a white knight's recovery.  Finally, there's ""hope"".  LOL."

It takes far longer, and requires far more documentation than you'd ever need.  Depending on how far you were planning to take the project, your experience, and your laziness, code can vary immensely from person to person.  Even style has a hand, if you have a particular style that simply doesn't work with a buyer('s team), again assuming you have one, it can be enough to make not buying or selling worth it."

CubeWorld,2wmrts,life617,13,Sun Feb 22 13:07:24 2015 UTC,Everything he got he brought on himself. He only got positive reviews for his initial release and people were thrilled with him. Then he basically took the money and ran. And you wonder why everyone turned on him?
CubeWorld,2wmrts,seymour47,-2,Sun Feb 22 15:48:28 2015 UTC,"I recall some server owner going after him financially, I am not quite sure how long after the beta release that happened though.   From my perspective as an introvert if Wollay truly is one. If something is causing me drama I tend to just ignore it. For example, lets say I have a girlfriend and I decide I want more space. I just won't pick up the phone when she calls... eventually she will stop calling... It's much easier that way."
CubeWorld,2wmrts,life617,6,Sun Feb 22 22:16:20 2015 UTC,"If an introvert took your money and promised to make, say, a fine wooden horse, and he packed up and fucked off after leaving you with five or six pieces of 2x4 selotaped together, would you be pissed off?

I know that people giving me extra attention is not the solution  and that someone in actual need deserves it. So I am content with excelling at something and not letting anyone know.

CubeWorld,2wgs89,Martanz,2,Thu Feb 19 20:11:35 2015 UTC,"Should, yes. But I highly doubt that he will. Teaming up won't work. If he wanted to say something, he would have done it a long time ago.  I do, however, think that the update will come eventually."
CubeWorld,2wgs89,AfroToast43,2,Thu Feb 19 21:14:52 2015 UTC,"He already gave his comment in game site interviews. Simply put, he is busy studying other rpgs and implementing as many types of quests as possible into the mission generator. More so, he is also trying to work this into a procedural questline system per area. This is pioneer territory for gaming and is simply something you cannot rush. Remember the dev mrelusive that invented navmeshes for 3d games? It took him over 4 years to get that tech perfected. He started when he was just a quake 1 modder. Why did it take so long? Because it was pioneer territory at the time in programming. Chances are if wollay succeeds at this Implementation, it will also be sold to other developers to be used in newer games. This isn't just making a game for wollay. The guy has a phd, and you expect him to simply be aiming so low? The guy is going to bank so hard on that quest system, cw wont even matter."

CubeWorld,2vsksq,dannmat,24,Fri Feb 13 19:01:29 2015 UTC,"From what i could gather from reading here on reddit, Wollay was always an introvert. People thought he abandoned the game before the alpha was released cause he was so quiet. Then he released the alpha. He then went back into his hole working on quests and what not.   Cube world isnt even his main side project. He has a full time job, and working on other things, Cube is like in his spare spare time. Im betting he took down the sales portion to stop getting the emails from more and more ppl as to why the alpha wasnt updated.   If you have noticed, for an alpha the game is actually really good, maybe lacking on content but what IS in there is pretty damn stable, and thats probably another reason it takes so long. I think Wollay wants everything to be perfect (or near to it) before he releases. My guess is he will release the quest pack and maybe a few more things in the summer or next summer, when ever thing is running smooth. But since its an alpha and just him and his wife working on it in their spare time then i dont expect to see daily updates to the game.  Now i do think he dropped the ball though. If i put out my game and so many people wanted to buy it that it crashed my store for 2 weeks (or was it even longer, i got it the 3rd day) then i would have dropped everything and used the money to start a studio, or at very least hired a few more programmers to focus on CW. but thats me."

CubeWorld,2v8lbz,NexasXellerk,5,Sun Feb 8 23:27:21 2015 UTC,What is it saying when you try to play?
CubeWorld,2v8lbz,AkariAkaza,3,Mon Feb 9 00:13:46 2015 UTC,You log into your picroma account and it's there under my games
CubeWorld,2v8lbz,Solyndros,2,Mon Feb 9 01:23:30 2015 UTC,The game is cool but there's very little to do honestly.

The game consists of 1. combat 2. running and gliding  Gliding is fun for like 5 minutes until you get the hang of it, and combat is simplistic as fuck, couple abilities and auto attack."
CubeWorld,2v8lbz,osunlyyde,5,Mon Feb 9 16:31:28 2015 UTC,"Crafting  Collecting items, pets, etc  Exploring  Shopping    Don't blame the game for being simple if ask you do is run around and fight"

CubeWorld,2v8lbz,EmotionalCrit,3,Mon Feb 9 18:00:56 2015 UTC,"By your logic games like Diablo 2 and 3, Path of Exile, Battlefield anything, DayZ, and H1Z1, are shit because ""95% of the game is running around fighting.""  There isn't a lot to do but that doesn't make the game not fun. I seriously played for around 7 hours yesterday just dungeon running, climbing those crazy tall tress for no damn reason, and trying to fight the bosses that were higher levels. I just explored for giggles and had a blast.  Not sure why you even visit this subreddit. Did you seriously come here to have an argument about how YOU don't enjoy the game? You have made 3 posts in this subreddit, all of which are negative. I hate Final Fantasy and find all iterations of it completely retarded and stupid, however, I am not subscribed to them nor do I randomly go to those subreddits just to piss and moan about how bad they are.  I enjoy this game, I hope this game becomes way more than it is. I also feel that the $15 dollars I spent on this game was worth it. I even bought a copy for my wife and she played with me for around a month, AND SHE HATES VIDEO GAMES! I visit this subreddit in hopes that people will post meaningful posts and to promote fun discussion on this game.  Now, I feel it is ok to speak for everyone on this sub, who enjoys the game. So kindly, Piss Off."

It looks amazing, it plays amazing, and it's a pretty decent score for 15 dollars.  However, due to no updates or news of updates on twitter for months when it takes about 10 seconds to make a tweet saying that he's still working on the game and/or what he is working on, I can't say I'll follow this game for very long.  I've found so many better games on Steam Early Access, a place notorious for harboring half-done shit that never gets updated.  I know we all love to circlejerk, but let's not ignore the problems here."

CubeWorld,2uxoxc,_Duax_,2,Fri Feb 6 13:58:39 2015 UTC,Platforming challenges in dungeons please. Maybe floating/hanging platforms over spikes/lava. Enemies could also be included to make the platforming slightly more difficult. Puzzle rooms would also be a nice challenge something simple like moving a block onto a button. These things would help break up the repetition of dungeons.

A particle system for when you have several spirit cubes on your weapon. For example 5 fire cubes will cause your weapon to emit little fire particles when you swing it around.  Make the ranger jumping ability work more like a super-jump rather than a retreat move. So the ranger can reposition himself easily. If people feel the move would become too powerful just lengthen the cooldown so the ranger can't endlessly jump away.  New playable species: fawn (or just something with horns), birdman, slug/snailman (for variety; not sure about this one)  Different camera options would be nice.  Clouds drift along in the sky instead of being static.  Hopefully an update comes. I really don't want cubeworld to be over."

Unfortunately, in crossover, it is many orders of magnitude slower than it is in windows and required downloading a bunch of dlls from an existing windows install or downloading them from a questionable source. I found it still effectively unplayable unless you set the visibility range (forgot what it's called) to the  minimum which means you can't see more than like 5 blocks ahead of you. I suspect the person who put up the gold rating didn't actually play the game or had very high end hardware.  EDIT: https://www.codeweavers.com/compatibility/browse/name/?app_id=11886"

Then you can run it with:  WINEARCH=win32 ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/Cube\ World/CubeLauncher.exe   but again, I had the same issue with performance. The performance may be better than the crossover version because I believe that the crossover one installs the entirety of directX whereas this one uses wine's version of directX. Note also that I used wine-silverlight and the svn version of winetricks on archlinux and am not sure what it is packaged as on other linuxes.  EDIT: After running, you will have hanging wine processes because it doesn't exit cleanly. To kill them, I run:  pkill -9 .exe kill -9 `ps aux|grep exe|grep -v grep|cut -d' ' -f2`"

CubeWorld,2uf45l,Crecell,0,Sun Feb 1 18:35:05 2015 UTC,"Cross class weapons. Warriors and Rogues should use similar weapons, it'd be cool for Rogues to have bows, or maybe just crossbows used at close range, and I'd love to see a Shaman class which could use almost any weapon. Even different weapons per specification would be cool. Fire Mages with swords they cast with, but the class losing bracelets. It'd give a more unique feel to each class / subclass"

CubeWorld,2ui0xm,Crecell,0,Mon Feb 2 09:34:56 2015 UTC,"no, not really. i was just posting about how utterly blown away i am at the fact that i haven't checked on this game that I LOVED when it was first released in alpha. and now a year and a half later i check back on it on a whim and not a single thing has been added, is all."
CubeWorld,2ui0xm,Crecell,3,Mon Feb 2 09:39:34 2015 UTC,You could have just agreed with one of the other few hundred threads restating that exact same thing. Their is absolutely nothing new in your thread so the only reason I can think of for making a new thread about it is that you wanted a good old ego groping from one of the others on this reddit.
CubeWorld,2ui0xm,Crecell,0,Mon Feb 2 12:05:54 2015 UTC,"wrong again. i just solemnly wanted to express my disgust along with the few hundred other posters who said 'the exact same thing'. dudes like you are the ones who want a good old ego groping, constantly perusing reddit to find something to disagree with. it has to be a sad existence. seeing as how you have only been on reddit for what appears to be a month i hope you can find a way to stop before it becomes a serious life problem. if you want to hold out hope on what could have been the precursor of the 'early access' take the money and run scams, fine bud. in the meantime, i'll leave the groping up to my girlfriend."
CubeWorld,2ui0xm,excessionoz,2,Tue Feb 3 01:39:48 2015 UTC,"hahaha! Dude, i've only signed up for a reddit account within the last month yeah but that in no way means I haven't ever used or read reddit posts before that. seeing as nobody but you responded or even mentioned my post how exactly am i looking for a ego boost? I'm simply pointing out that your boring as post has been stated millions of times and like the other people on this reddit we're bored with it. go moan somewhere else."

CubeWorld,2tldig,Red_Reign,14,Thu Feb 19 12:24:57 2015 UTC,"I'm happy that your excited but let me warn you of a giant red flag that seems to repeat itself in many forms with this game...  Why did you have to email them about the shop being closed? The information concerning the shop being closed should have been posted on the shop site. It should have been tweeted out and been on the news page for the game. But yet none of this EXTREMELY simple things were done. Why? Why do they continue to have such a lack of respect for the people who believed enough in them to hand over money? I really don't see what is so hard about a tweet once a week with a little update. ""Working on the website, purchasing will be down for a while."" Oh my god I think I need a nap, that was so hard.  For me, these two have long lost the benefit of the doubt. Where is the proof anything, at all, has been done in past few months. They are making Blizzard look like the jack rabbits of game development.  For the people that enjoy this game, I'm envious. I wish I could share your jubilation and excitement over this game."
CubeWorld,2tldig,GoochRash,6,Sun Jan 25 16:14:32 2015 UTC,"The fact that he said ""Yeah I'm still working on it,"" even if it's not fake, proves nothing in my book.  Something tells me he'll be sending that same reply in 3 years."

CubeWorld,2tldig,Syberz,3,Sun Jan 25 20:36:01 2015 UTC,"Just something i discovered: all these (fake) mail responds get posted by the same person (or atleast all of the german guys who get these mails; only germans seem to get responds btw;, use the same mail program, screen formatting, same way to blur contact data and post it the same way.). There's like 5 of them now, all almost the same screenshot size, mail client, formatting, content and way of publications.Thus making me think, all of these Pixxie responds from the german guy(s) are made up &  fake."
CubeWorld,2tldig,Blubbll,2,Sun Jan 25 22:05:25 2015 UTC,"Lol, there was no editing involved here. I just captured a section of my e-mail. Also, I'm not German.

CubeWorld,2tldig,Frankst4r,2,Mon Jan 26 00:07:49 2015 UTC,post the email header.
CubeWorld,2tldig,FanFu,6,Tue Jan 27 10:11:21 2015 UTC,"To the people who think that is is fake and that the same person has posted this before:   Same program is used: Gmail has been used all the times, I saw someone comment on the program used, and I'm pretty sure this is just a Gmail. At least my Gmail looks like this. Person is german: The german text on the bottom of the email is most likely just an automatic signature feature that Pixxie uses. Like some people have ""Sent from my iPhone"" on the bottom of the email. The formatting and way of bluring contact information is the same: This again may very well just be coincidence. I myself would very likely use red as a way to blur out contact information. I have done that before, because then it is no doubt that something is blurred. The size of the picture is the same: Well, this is the one thing that can point at it being fake. For using one of the previous pictures to forge this is the easiest way of doing it. But then again, it may just be a coincidence, maybe this size is good for not reavealing to much when print screening Gmail, I don't know.   A lot of people use Gmail, and the OP is not necessarily german, so I don't think that it should be called fake based on this. But, judge for yourself. The fact is that the shop and registration has been pulled down, and I think that means something is happening.   Let's just hope that it is real. And if anyone here is from germany, why not try to call the company? A number was posted here earlier, and the address is on the website :P"
CubeWorld,2tldig,FanFu,7,Sun Jan 25 22:28:01 2015 UTC,"It is real. I cut it so it didn't reveal much of my gmail, though I could do a screen cap and blur out everything related to me..."

CubeWorld,2tldig,FanFu,-12,Mon Jan 26 06:06:27 2015 UTC,Another proof that it's fake is that the OP change the complete System language to English. Btw: There's programs/websites that can fake the email sender.  I could also come up with a fully depicted Pixxie mail if i wanted to.  Just keep this in mind.
CubeWorld,2tldig,Blubbll,7,Mon Jan 26 13:46:47 2015 UTC,Changed the system language? What the hell? There is no proof that he did that.
CubeWorld,2tldig,FanFu,-6,Mon Jan 26 13:52:39 2015 UTC,"The language before that was German, at leadt the browser was and this has been before in all the 6 screenshots he posted. Only the full screenshot is full english (browser and system)"
CubeWorld,2tldig,Blubbll,2,Mon Jan 26 14:35:47 2015 UTC,"I do not see a German browser. All the German I see is the ""u date/time schreib"", which means written on and I just an automatic signature from Pixxie. ."
CubeWorld,2tldig,FanFu,-2,Mon Jan 26 17:49:51 2015 UTC,"Oh, that would explain a lot and thus could mean that the update might really come this year... well, i'm ready about the multiplayer part, it's just a single server.exe file to swap"

CubeWorld,2tldig,brickwallnomad,1 point,Sun Jan 25 22:05:35 2015 UTC,"As a developer, switching to OpenGL instead of DirectX should not take nearly that long, unless his code is an absolute mess.

I can't wait....  I have a strange feeling... I don't know why but I think the online shop is going to open again soon and after I can imagine that we are going to see an update in the web or something from twitter but is coming...

It's been waaay too fucking long for me to even be remotely invested in caring about whether or not it actually updates. I might check in once every six months, but it's always the same deal. Wollay isn't updating shit, doesn't speak to anyone and is ""still working on it"". Bullshit.  People like to give him slack because ""that's just how he works"" etc. His workpace and reclusiveness when he's doing it on his own dime is his business, but the instant he put it up for people to pay for, then it becomes an entirely different story.

CubeWorld,2tldig,Blubbll,-1,Sun Jan 25 19:47:56 2015 UTC,"I do not mean to offend, nor am I saying you faked your email. I am only stating a possibility. Given the amount of people reporting responses through email, I am more inclined to believe them, but the possibility is still their. This wouldnt really be a problem if we got an offical announcement through twitter or something. Once again, I'm not trying to accuse you of anything."
CubeWorld,2tldig,FanFu,2,Mon Jan 26 00:14:07 2015 UTC,No offense taken. I understand that anything can be edited. Just know that I have no intention of doing such a thing. It would be a waste of my time to place fake hope in a product I haven't even played/purchased.
CubeWorld,2tldig,Blubbll,-2,Mon Jan 26 00:33:48 2015 UTC,"This sub is basically sorted into people who still believe in Wollay and people who don't.  I personally don't, because it's been 3 years without an update, and 6-7 months without any word whatsoever. However, if the game IS updated (which I find unlikely) then I'll definitely go back to playing it.  EDIT: As FanFu so politely pointed out, it was 1.5 years, not 3."
CubeWorld,2tldig,FanFu,8,Mon Jan 26 00:40:45 2015 UTC,"1,5 years.. Not 3, get your shit straight."
CubeWorld,2tldig,FanFu,2,Sun Jan 25 11:42:58 2015 UTC,That's what I meant - my bad.
CubeWorld,2tldig,anonymau5,1 point,Sun Jan 25 12:37:48 2015 UTC,Anything in excess of 12 months is still worthy of condemnation.
CubeWorld,2tldig,MationMac,1 point,Sun Jan 25 16:30:23 2015 UTC,"The game hasn't even been released for that long, stop exaggerating."
CubeWorld,2tldig,boltorian,1 point,Fri Feb 6 03:09:10 2015 UTC,Read the edit.
CubeWorld,2tldig,anonymau5,0,Sun Jan 25 16:43:58 2015 UTC,"It's been like 1 and a half years, what the hell are you on about"
CubeWorld,2tldig,Dicethrower,0,Sun Jan 25 20:05:01 2015 UTC,"The fun thing is that it's always (the same) a german guy who has these fishy so-called ""proofs"""
CubeWorld,2tldig,boltorian,4,Sun Jan 25 13:22:33 2015 UTC,Why assume he is german?
CubeWorld,2tldig,fluffygreysocks,0,Sun Jan 25 14:18:03 2015 UTC,"Am, um, schrieb. Also german time & date format.  He seems to be the only one to actually get responses ever and literarily spams these here. I've seen like more than 5 of him and it always is the same. I guess this is fake."
CubeWorld,2tldig,ColinStyles,6,Sun Jan 25 14:19:58 2015 UTC,"I think that is just an automatic thing Pixxie has when she send an email, it's on her part of it, like a signature. And if it is him we have seen before then he has more than one account.  It's been on all the other emails we have seen from Pixxie."
CubeWorld,2tldig,fernando_69,2,Sun Jan 25 14:22:46 2015 UTC,"It's not automatic. She pointed out specifics from my e-mail, like Mac support."
CubeWorld,2tldig,ColinStyles,2,Sun Jan 25 14:28:44 2015 UTC,"The German time thing is automatic, that's what I was trying to say ;)"
CubeWorld,2tldig,fernando_69,1 point,Mon Jan 26 00:10:40 2015 UTC,The german time format is from them.
CubeWorld,2tldig,Dicethrower,2,Mon Jan 26 06:04:59 2015 UTC,Not German.
CubeWorld,2tldig,AndrewPH,-2,Mon Jan 26 00:09:54 2015 UTC,Super excited! Can't wait to see what they have in store for us! People are complaining about updates but look at the GTA V PC port... The game was released for console in September 2013
CubeWorld,2tldig,Dicethrower,2,Mon Jan 26 00:09:03 2015 UTC,You're comparing something that people purchased and have been complaining about to something that hasn't released yet on PC? I was very happy with GTAV on console.  Try comparing GTAV PC to Cubeworld Mac/Console instead.
CubeWorld,2tldig,AndrewPH,2,Sun Jan 25 14:52:46 2015 UTC,"Well with GTA V you know for a fact that the game is actually being worked on, that it will be released, updated, and supported.  Sorry to burst your bubble but the same can't be said about CW."
CubeWorld,2tldig,Dicethrower,-5,Mon Jan 26 15:58:50 2015 UTC,Did you not see all the quest updates happening last summer? Check Wollays twitter
CubeWorld,2tldig,Tramd,0,Sun Jan 25 15:50:47 2015 UTC,"Which are still not in the game. Something you can literally code in an afternoon (all the tools are there), is still not in the game after almost a year."
CubeWorld,2tldig,Dicethrower,0,Sun Jan 25 15:56:43 2015 UTC,I appreciate that there are two types of people.  I'm not optimistic about cube world being updated again. Even if it were updated again I'm sure that we'd be waiting another 1.5 years for the update after that and I'm not interested in following this game forever.  Then there are people who are almost doe eyed in their optimism.  It's probably happier to be optimistic even if it's unrealistic so good on you.
CubeWorld,2tldig,Transcriber3,-1,Sun Jan 25 21:57:23 2015 UTC,"C: this makes me happy :O Enough to make an account! It makes sense of the delay, an actual product making programmer only writes about 50-100 lines of working code a day by themselves. Add a life and probably a full time job, side projects just don't get put in the spot light D:   I think the fact that anything happened on the website is a sign that someone still cares on their end about the game <3 yes some kind of tweet once a week or even a month would be great but people get busy"
CubeWorld,2tldig,seiyria,1 point,Mon Jan 26 07:29:28 2015 UTC,"I would fire someone coding that slowly, even a student intern should easily be able to write far more on average.  Even if the majority of your work is out of your field of expertise, you should be coding attempts or debugging code that would probably hit over that amount alone."
CubeWorld,2tldig,Transcriber3,0,Tue Jan 27 19:03:26 2015 UTC,"There is water about 12 miles in (30 mile hike), so you don't like to have you!"
CubeWorld,2tldig,cmp1,2,Tue Jan 27 23:51:11 2015 UTC,"There is water about 12 miles in (30 mile hike), so you don't like to have you!   This is the most out of context inane incomprehensible comment I have ever received in 22 years of existence.  This is not something to be proud of."
CubeWorld,2tjq4d,Fuey500,3,Sat Jan 24 21:02:33 2015 UTC,"Oh god please someone check it! i don't have an account so i can't see it for myself, but if someone can confirm this it is big news!"
CubeWorld,2tjq4d,ClassyArgentinean,5,Sun Jan 25 06:28:50 2015 UTC,can confirm A LOT MORE
CubeWorld,2tjq4d,PerCat,1 point,Sun Jan 25 07:26:27 2015 UTC,Where?  My account still has the same ones.
CubeWorld,2tjq4d,JacobThePianist,3,Sun Feb 1 13:23:02 2015 UTC,Oh wow! Very cool! Great catch and exciting prospects!
CubeWorld,2tjq4d,anonymau5,3,Sun Jan 25 06:36:06 2015 UTC,Also did the adventure section of the homepage always have missions and portals filled in? Just had a quick read through and I really don't remember them being written in
CubeWorld,2tjq4d,Crecell,2,Sun Jan 25 10:11:12 2015 UTC,I think it may have because both are in-game if I'm correct portals are just super rare.
CubeWorld,2tjq4d,tblade10,1 point,Sun Jan 25 17:55:56 2015 UTC,Always been there.
CubeWorld,2tjq4d,Tonio64286,3,Mon Feb 2 20:53:04 2015 UTC,"I just checked that, it seems you're right!  :D"
CubeWorld,2tkusl,onedollawin,6,Sun Jan 25 03:04:31 2015 UTC,You can't even if you wanted to.
CubeWorld,2tkusl,Syberz,3,Sun Jan 25 03:36:04 2015 UTC,"''Cube World still hasn't been updated since July 2013, as of January 24th, 2015''  i mean... it says everything you need to know..."
CubeWorld,2tkusl,opendamnation,2,Sun Jan 25 03:11:43 2015 UTC,I'd say no
CubeWorld,2tkusl,mgriff2k4,2,Sun Jan 25 03:11:19 2015 UTC,"This is how I see it : I think you should buy it. Why? well, the game as it is right now is really fun. It makes you kill cute ""harmless"" animals at the beginning and level up. Then you see human/humanoid enemies and attempt to attack them and earn XP or get a weapon. However, the game is not being updated as often as other titles but the way I see it, why would they release a video of an upcoming patch that will introduce a plethora of new things and then not continue updating the game. I've played the game with a few friends and it was a blast. One down side, it chugs on dat CPU like crazy. But man/woman, if you wanna try it and  you got the extra cash to buy it, buy it. Play it and see what the game can be once the day comes where you no longer see ""Cubeworld is up to date""."
CubeWorld,2tkusl,SporadicHuman,6,Sun Jan 25 03:14:45 2015 UTC,"The videos are what confuses me the most.  Lets assume that Wollay is only in this for the money and is perfectly OK with taking everyone's money and running off with it. The last video demonstrated a good enough amount of content. If wollay wanted to abandon the project and run off with everyone's money why not at the very least release what's already done of the next update.  The first update in 2 years would be enough hype to bring in a good amount of chump change, right?"
CubeWorld,2tkusl,quick_useless,1 point,Sun Jan 25 03:24:45 2015 UTC,"True. I guess I have that hope that he'll update it soon and start comunicating with his fan base. Also, i really hope that when he updates the game(If he does) that the patch is like 50GB. Imagine getting a 1kb patch. Bruh."
CubeWorld,2tkusl,SporadicHuman,1 point,Sun Jan 25 18:28:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think Wollay's communication will change unless he feels it in him to get a community manager (paid or volunteer) and communicates with them. he doesn't seem to enjoy talking with the world at large.   as for the size of the patch, if it adds a lot of content it could be a couple megabytes and i wouldn't care. The game is mostly procedurally generated, so a few megabytes can go a long way.  now, can you imagine if he released a patch and the feature list was just   various bug fixes   and that was it?"
CubeWorld,2tkusl,quick_useless,2,Sun Jan 25 21:31:10 2015 UTC,"I would just face palm, gather myself, and at least be thankful he did something. Right? man, I don't know anymore."
CubeWorld,2tkusl,SporadicHuman,2,Sun Jan 25 22:40:48 2015 UTC,"There have been evidence from people who messaged him. He responded saying the game is still being worked on, he wants to release everything at once instead of updates."
CubeWorld,2tkusl,kynect2hymn,2,Sun Jan 25 03:44:06 2015 UTC,Steal it. He doesn't deserve your money. Lol
CubeWorld,2tkusl,Kydaminn,-3,Sun Jan 25 03:26:36 2015 UTC,Don't think you belong in this subreddit
CubeWorld,2tjke0,Spycee,2,Sat Jan 24 20:14:55 2015 UTC,The monolith is the KOTH script. It's public now. You can change the tower to be everything you like though. You can find the script somewhere in the github of cuwo
CubeWorld,2tjke0,Blubbll,1 point,Sat Jan 24 23:54:01 2015 UTC,"Ohh, thanks !  I didn't know the name of the script.  I installed it, but it does nothing ...  No error at startup, the script seems correct, but there's no monolith, or the 2-swords icon.  I tried with / without the pvp script and the ctf script, in case they were needed.  When I check the script, it seems to me that the config is not loaded, there's no coordinates to load.  Do you have an idea ?  Thanks !"
CubeWorld,2tjke0,Blubbll,2,Sun Jan 25 01:50:50 2015 UTC,"Try older versions of cuwo and this script, then do /koth_start"

CubeWorld,2tjeup,TheAntiHick,-2,Sat Jan 24 22:21:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, according to several members of this ""community"" who have zero evidence on their side, there's an absolutely massive update right around the corner that includes mac support and console release.  And the fact that the store is down just proves that they're right.  Somehow."
CubeWorld,2tjeup,mattymck,1 point,Sun Jan 25 00:21:14 2015 UTC,I dint think anyone is saying this.  I see a lot more people just saying the game is dead.  Which it is.
CubeWorld,2tjeup,TheAntiHick,1 point,Sun Jan 25 04:30:01 2015 UTC,Everything I said has been stated at least once by one of wollay's various white knights.
CubeWorld,2tfxnx,justsomedoood,6,Fri Jan 23 20:51:53 2015 UTC,"My Server is cw.zircon.at, a fairly well-played PvE server.

It has daily seed rotation, player stats, a stable server setup, many fixes, 6-hourly restarts to keep things smooth, player balancing, autorestart on crash, an ip counter,127 Slots on the Mirror-servers, a short, perfect-fitting IP and a server status website (http://cw.zircon.at).

CubeWorld,2tfxnx,GryphenLoL,1 point,Sun Jan 25 00:49:17 2015 UTC,"Cause that's not possible anymore. The level whitelist mod makes the Server too unstable and not work correctly.

CubeWorld,2tfxnx,ENTPformybunghole,1 point,Tue Jan 27 03:41:35 2015 UTC,Germany. This shouldn't be laggy though as there's maximal 10 players online on each mirror server. You can donate money so i can rent more mirror-servers though.
