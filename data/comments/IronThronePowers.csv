It flipped over the edge of the table, cookies raining everywhere, spinning in slow motion...  Claaaang  The two girls had just been given their lemoncakes across the room when the tray hit the floor. The two chefs who had given them  looked up, as did the closer chef whom the girls had failed to distract. The boys froze.

IronThronePowers,3e5dxl,scortenraad,2,Wed Jul 22 02:53:54 2015 UTC,"Steffon and Adura met up at Fort No-Starks-Allowd and reviewed the loot that the young Hunter had made off with. He'd grabbed 10 cookies, 2 lemoncakes and 2 of the tarts that the chefs had been working on. He sagely decided that Adura should have the lemoncakes and the tarts, eating a few of the cookies while they waited for the other raiders to show up. Sandy sat between the two children licking up the crumbs off the floor and their faces. Steffon began to worry when Renly, Martyn and Adhira didn't show up.  ""What if the others got caught?"" he asked Adura worriedly. The smaller girl's brow furrowed in between a bite lemoncake before shrugging her shoulders and giggling as Sandy licked her face. ""What if they're in timeout? Timeouts are the worst."" Steffon hated timeouts, almost as much as he hated naps. Not that he was in trouble very often, but still. He frowned at the bag of fresh cookies as he weighed his options. If they were in timeout that would mean being stuck in their room for hours and that wasn't right. ""We could escape them!"" he exclaimed excitedly to Adura. ""We'll break them out of the dungeons so they can have cookies too!"" He leaped to his feet, causing Sandy to jump up and look up at her owner. ""C'mon Adura, we gotta go rescue them!"" He started to run off before remembering the cookies. He tucked them safely away in the walls of No-Starks-Allowd and then embarked on his grand quest.  The two remaining bandits slunk through the Drum Keep, heading towards the hallway that held all of their rooms. No one paid the two children and Sandy any mind. When they reached their destination Steffon saw Renly's Mum, Lady Meredyth, sitting near the entrance of Renly's room, working on something with yarn and needles in her lap. Adhira's room was the furthest from the Lady, they would rescue her first, then Martyn and lastly Renly. He wouldn't be able to use Adura as a distraction this time, but Sandy might be able to help out... He formed a quick plan and whispered it to Adura. ""You go get your sister from her room, I'll get Martyn and Renly. We'll meet up back at Fort No-Stark-Allowd. And be quiet!""

IronThronePowers,3e22hg,rollme,2,Tue Jul 21 18:59:33 2015 UTC,But why would you need to know this?
IronThronePowers,3e11z8,MournSigil,3,Tue Jul 21 03:24:44 2015 UTC,"Nate's old eyes noticed the woman enter with a confidence and surety to her movements that there was no question she was a highborn lady. One accustomed to being listened to as well. It was only when she came closer that he could notice her tan complexion and could finally fathom whom she must be. His hand reflexively slid across his grey mustache as he considered how to best handle this.  Working at the bar had been a relaxing task since beginning his work in the Red Keep, but he would need aid soon. Too much was required of him in his new duties. Offering a grin to whom he expected to be the Dornish lady, Nate finished up drying off a glass, placing it away, and tossing the towel into a bin. He said, ""I would, and I imagine you are Lady Delonne Allyrion? I thank you for coming to see me, I can imagine the winter period causes your business here to suffer some with less people wandering the streets. If you'd follow me, there's a back room just this way. The hearth is already on, I'll have Rose or Elsa fetch us some warmed wine as well."""
IronThronePowers,3e11z8,hewhoknowsnot,3,Tue Jul 21 03:51:54 2015 UTC,"""The plague was worse, but winter has been no boon,"" Delonne had to admit as she peeled off her kid leather gloves. Her boots clacked softly against the floor as she followed the Master of Whispers to the back room. Her eyes wandered slowly about, the atmosphere of this place much different from that of her own establishment.   ""But, I am fortunate in that I am not dependent upon a single source of income. Winter is not so cruel in Godsgrace as it is in King's Landing. I trust that your transition into the small council has been a smooth one?""  There were plenty of murmurs when she had been appointed to the Small Council. The idea of one of the Dornish on the council had angered some. The idea of a woman on the council had infuriated others. She could only imagine what their reaction to a man of humble birth might be."
IronThronePowers,3e11z8,hewhoknowsnot,4,Tue Jul 21 04:17:52 2015 UTC,"""The plague ravished much of the city here, fortunately the Street of Silks was not one of those damaged by the ensuing fires,"" they reached the room with a hearth to the right, fire burning. In the center was a sturdy wooden table, Nate's Place was well built but not one of many decorations or embellishments into it. There were four chairs around the table, with lamps along the walls to keep the light even throughout the room.  Stepping over and taking a seat, Elsa followed them in with two glasses of warmed wine and a decanter of more red wine placed on the table before she left closing the door behind her. Nate sat down waiting for Delonne to follow suit, he began, ""The Small Council...I believe I am playing the game well enough for now, but it is early and I am showing too open a hand. There were matters I wished to discuss with you and, if it seemed appropriate, a proposal too. But we can get to that later.""  ""No doubt in your time as Mistress of Whispers, Lady Allyrion, you came across much knowledge,"" Nate tried to see if he could read anything from her but she was able to hold her expressions well. His wrinkled forehead creased as he went on, ""Lord Tyrell was seemingly poisoned recently and as you know Lord Hightower also passed. I would like to know if you had any information from your time as Mistress of Whispers that would aid me. Any advice you might be willing to share would be welcome as well.""  He was not so much worried about advice as the actual whispers but this in itself was a game and he would have to play his role for the time being."
IronThronePowers,3e11z8,hewhoknowsnot,2,Tue Jul 21 04:59:45 2015 UTC,"The fire was a welcome sight after her journey through the winter wonderland that was King's Landing. Her steps carried her quickly toward its warmth and she settled down into the offered chair, sparing a quick glance to Elsa as she poured the wine. She took a slow sip of the wine while listening to her replacement, the warmth of the fluid radiated through her and she almost felt as though she had thawed out at last.   ""I am afraid I will not have much that I can share that may aid you in this matter. There are limits to what my girls can do and toward the end of my tenure as Mistress of Whispers several of them went missing while away gathering information in the North and Iron Islands.""  The firelight shone within the dark pools of her eyes as her head inclined thoughtfully.  ""The breakdown in communication made it difficult for me to provide the information that the Crown needed. Lord Drumm said as much when he advised that my services would no longer be needed."""
IronThronePowers,3e11z8,hewhoknowsnot,2,Tue Jul 21 23:35:16 2015 UTC,"Nate took a sip of the wine as well. It appeared the former Mistress of Whispers planned to make this more difficult then it needed to be. Very well. He set the wine down. He gazed back at the Lady of Godsgrace then continued, ""Two months ago, Houses Fowler and Caron were contentious in the Prince's Pass. It seems a former friendship had soured between the two.""  He paused ringing a finger along the top of the wine glass. Nate went on, ""Information has a habit of flowing into King's Landing and typically it is the holder of the Master of Whispers seat who gains the most of this. But where that information flows to next is in the hands of that same person. There are lingering plots from your time in that seat. I would like to know what they are, but do not think this will only aid myself."""
IronThronePowers,3e11z8,AgentWyoming,2,Wed Jul 22 00:04:43 2015 UTC,"""There has never truly been a friendship there,"" Delonne replied flatly, her gaze leveled with Nate's, her usual dulcet tone returned when she continued. She leaned forward a bit in her seat.  ""The Maesters were always scheming, the Great Council was proof enough of that.  As I hear it though, the plague was particularly devastating to the Maesters so that may have done well to disrupt whatever they had planned. May not be a bad idea to keep an eye on them though.""  She settled back into the chair again, studying the new Master of Whispers.   ""Nearly every girl I sent to the Iron Islands would send me very detailed messages indicating potential trouble only to vanish without a trace afterward. The Iron Born will always be the Iron Born.""  Her gaze fell to the glass in her hand and the trace remains of wine within.  ""I would advise you speak with Lord Velaryon about a fund for your operations. I operated at my own expense independent of the Crown...I do not recommend it."""
IronThronePowers,3e11z8,AgentWyoming,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:40:21 2015 UTC,"The Maesters were not who he expected, being mostly just trained commonfolk themselves. Maester Marwyn was in the Red Keep, but he was not sure what ties he had to any greater plot. The Ironborn were already a concern to him, but he would need to test Lord Drumm to see how true that was. Swiping his hand through his mustache as he considered this, Nate would have much to think on after this.  ""Thank you for your insight, Lady Allyrion. Would you like any more wine?"" Nate asked lifting the decanter in case she did and at the least being able to top his own glass off. As for funds, well, that was likely up to the mogods and how much gold his tavern made during the winter season.   ""Perhaps this would be a good time to go into the proposal I had mentioned earlier,"" Nate knew this would be going into the heart of his plans. But the Lady of Godsgrace was thought to be dangerous by everyone he had spoken with of her on the Small Council and securing her should be a valuable resource. ""We both know the benefits and the limitations of what is...reported to those in your former office. I would propose to provide you with any information I come across that would be of interest to your family. In exchange any information you may come across would be shared as well, in addition to a supply of poison every year."""

He looked over, and could see that she was in pain, and that her water must have broken.  ""I'll be right back. I promise."" He said, barely masking the panic in his voice as he flew out of the room and around the corner to the maester's chambers.  He nearly flung the door of its hinges as he called out breathlessly to Maester Narsel. ""It's Sarra... The baby... GO. NOW.""  In an instant the whole house was suddenly awake, various nurses bustling past him into the bedchamber, rushed and anxious chatter mingling with Sarra's screams. He had to get in there.  He shoved his way through the door, almost throwing a large nurse with an indignant expression who had tried to block him to the floor, his mind only on one thing. Sarra.  He saw her lying on the edge of her bed, Narsel and a couple of midwives crowding around her legs as she pushed and screamed and gasped for air. Alliser knelt down at her side and grabbed hold of her hand.  ""I'm here, Sarra, look at me, I'm here, I'm not going anywhere."" Her nails dug into his hand as she turned her head to look at him, eyes wide and glassy with pain and fear, opening her mouth only to let out another shriek of agony. Alliser stayed there, for what felt like an eternity, unable to look away from her eyes, trying to soothe her and keep her breathing regularly.  Sarra's back arched as her lips parted in a silent scream, head jerking away and eyes clenching shut, though the quiet was pierced by a high pitched wail, a sound that almost made Alliser's heart stop in his chest, and then explode as the blood came rushing back.  At the foot of the bed, Maester Narsel stood, holding their child, wrapped in fresh white linen, bringing him close for Alliser to see. A boy. A baby boy, our baby boy.  Sarra had fallen back into the sweat-soaked sheets in sheer exhaustion, the laboured rise and fall of her chest showing how her body was reeling from the exertion and strain. Alliser helped her sit up, and placed their son in her arms, planting a kiss on her forehead, then on her cheek, then on her lips. He felt her mouth curve into a smile as she began to weep with laughter as he held her, and she held their son, her eyes fixed upon the small life wrapped up in white cloth in her arms, that she had brought into the world.  All Alliser could see and feel was Sarra, and their child, and for the first time since he had met her, Alliser knew exactly what he wanted to say.  ""Sarra, I love you. I will always love you, and I will never let you go. Without you I would be less than nothing. You said to me that this child was our future, and any future with you is a perfect one, for the three of us. His name is Royland. Our son, and one day the heir to Hayford. I may not feel ready, and you may not either, I won't let either of you down, and we can figure it all out together. I love you, Sarra Thorne.""

Since Mace's death he had toiled with whether to trust the Small Council or not, but after years of examining them he thought he at least owed them the courtesy of being somewhat forthcoming in the matter. He had missed many meeting since Mace died, his access to them all but revoked. The feeling of watching history being made was addicting, and though Marq was busy looking after Margaery, her family stewing in Highgarden, he had to admit that he missed being part of those tedious meetings.

Witnesses report a duel between Lucas Blackwood and Jonos Bracken, as well as fighting breaking out around them. Both men were killed as a result of the battle, and in the confusion, the sept at Pennytree caught fire from a stray arrow, and burned down. Lord Tytos Blackwood left Pennytree for Raventree Hall shortly before the fighting started."" Addison frowned. ""Beyond this, many hold their doubts. My liege, Lord Tully had arrived before our party, and had questioned one Dornishman from the Brave Companions, before releasing him. I cannot shake the feeling that Vargo Hoat and his men were involved, but Lord Tully released the Brave Companion without punishment.""  Addison began to pace along the council's table. ""My liege appears content to wait this incident out, but I know not what he waits for. People lie dead on both sides, with some in the middle; the Faith has seen yet another sept burned under the King's peace, and a response has been slow to come. I suggest we demand reparations for Pennytree from both sides, as if they had each set the sept ablaze. Each share will be used to rebuild and protect Pennytree from future bloodshed. Perhaps we might pay a small contingency of guards loyal to the Crown to watch over the lands, or award them permanently to a worthy house?"""
IronThronePowers,3e0hv0,hewhoknowsnot,3,Tue Jul 21 17:38:36 2015 UTC,"""Lord Tully has no interest in a large project to rebuild the damages"" Petyr answered. ""The Septon Varys gave figures for a Great Sept while I calculated some of my own for defending the town with a wall and fort. However Lord Tully wishes for there to be a Small Sept and no public works projects this winter"""
IronThronePowers,3e0hv0,hewhoknowsnot,2,Tue Jul 21 17:47:27 2015 UTC,"""So we take lives from the smallfolk, and give them nothing for their sorrow?"" Addison had not heard of Lord Tully's decision. ""That is unacceptable. We will spark unrest on the scale of Septon Marcus if we allow effigies of the Faith to be burned. The Old King made a vow to always protect the Faith. Are we abiding by that vow if we follow Lord Tully's wishes?"" Perhaps he would be more afraid to speak directly against his liege, but his new position - and his missing sister - spurred him to wrath much faster than usual."

Even now, with his bruised wife in the room, every time his eyes closed his thoughts strayed to another, to Cersei Lannister. He was deep in thought about her, a book lying open but unread on his desk, when he heard the knocks. Alys? What does she want?

If it's the former than I feel it shouldn't be included in an official mod post.   The key to plots is communication, between the players and the mods and after the last plot we can all see that it was the main factor in the storm that followed. Questions where asked to late, and not at all. RP was done that could have effected the plot when the target knew he was being plotted against.   Questions were asked too late? It seems like the mod team really dropped the ball on this one. We rely on the mods to run plots that players won't be able to agree to, the fact that this one slipped through is worrisome given that questions about why and how weren't asked until after the fact. I've seen more than a few questionable plots run/slip through only to be retconned after people have realized proper questions weren't asked.    As a community we have a lot of disagreements, but we also move past them and improve by working together and discussing them thoroughly. This is why ITP has lasted so long when others have faltered. We should take that approach here too.   I'm going to disagree with you here. ITP has lasted longer because it's been more collaborative than powers. Powergaming will inevitably lead to everyone but the winner being salty. It'll lead to unnecessary and thoughtless deaths by players that have no respect for their peers. What bothers me the most is people that have little to no respect for other people's characters/the work they've put into this game. To kill another person's character with little to no reason other than trying to cause chaos is bullshit and shouldn't have any place in our game. You allow plots like this one to slip through more often and this game will come to a close more quickly than you can imagine.  Look, I get it, some players want/need chaos. But I feel like creating chaos for no reason (why hello meta-plague, I'm looking at you) might drive stories in the short-term, it'll destroy the sub in the long run. If this sub becomes anything short of a collaborative story-telling (where stories will sometimes conflict and lead to winners and losers) it won't last long at all."

In my honest opinion, a large part of this community is stuck up their arse when it comes to their characters and character development. We try to stop the random killing, it doesn't always happen. If it was an RP we wouldn't have rules for stabbing and such. This isn't Ironthrone RP or whatever it is, this isn't a pristine world where there is no risk.

The two of them had a plot in mind where MCP would take the throne from ty as he went missing. Which was collaborative, the problem came from the fact that two of my characters and one of Phoenix's and various Kingsguard claims were highjacked without 'collaborating' with any of those claims.  We all kinda put up with it at the time but that was only collaborative between two people  Meanwhile we look at another big event the night Tywin died and see more collaboration between each side of the conspiracy but none between those who wrote the orders those following them and those being affected by it. If I had gotten a PM saying ""Hey youre being arrested"" I wouldve asked to hit pause then and hashed out how they had some of the intel they had. Most was legit (with some fuzziness on dates for the dornish ship for instance) however a decent amount was gleaned through chat logs instead of IC orders.  IF we truly collaborated we could have worked it out before time bubbling us too much or going into a crazy Meta Trial, but we didnt. Each side wanted to win and tried to leave no room for second chances. It was very evident when I asked for my accusers to face me for one last chance to RP as Tywin in public (before I assumed Id be murdered by Lucerys) with those I spent many hours writing with before. Some final words so to speak.  But those words could have damaged the ""victory"" accomplished and so instead of collaborating, they chose to use mechanics and battle to take me in under their terms. Terms I'd rather not write into and chose to die instead.   'Collaborative' does NOT happen in this sub as far as ambition goes. We have seen the Stormlands do collaboration to the extent of killing a minor character, we have seen the new batch of LPs work together to work out a decent story. But total collaboration is a bunch of malarkey, the moment two players have diverging opinions or goals suddenly it becomes a competition.  And as much as it may seem like Im complaining I DONT think its a bad thing. I do not think this many people is good for a true Collaborative RP, and the idea of this being a game is unique. Idk maybe Im tired. The point is this place is only collaborative when you're allies"
IronThronePowers,3dzut0,tehcrispy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:48:38 2015 UTC,"My own   Kindly, remove your personal opinion from an official mod post. I understand that you have one and appreciate you wanting to express it but really, using your advantage as a mod to do so isn't right.   Collaborative story is the wrong phrase, but it is not collaborative it never has been.   It isn't? Please, explain to me how it isn't. I'd like to hear to other mods thoughts on this as well.   Just look at the bullshit MCP came up with as King. Nothing says collaborative RP like doing sod all but smutting.   Your point gets lost by your tactless shitting on another player. Oh, and the fact that this is a blatant red herring. You point to one ""bad"" spot in the game and claim it as a basis for your point? I have a counter that works even better. Look at the Stormlands, they've created a lot of collaborative chaos that works well for everyone involved. There's been lots of stories created and minimal salt/mod involvement.    The plot was started by myself, and then handed over to another mod as I was in work. I had a busy weekend, as did many other mods. Others, as seen have unclaimed for various reasons. The mods work to keep things running as best we can, it's hard to heard cats. Mistakes happen, most of the time they do not.   Mistakes happen. You call not fact checking properly and a player's main character dying as a result a mistake? I'd call it being careless.   In this plot, Euron wanted to kidnap his 'bride' in his eyes. However as stated the plot was stopped. His plan was to have a man stab people to cause panic and snatch her in the confusion, the rolls led it to being Lord Dayne who would be stabbed, a 3% chance.   A bride he didn't have any reason to know the location of, at a wedding he didn't know was happening and stabbing a man he didn't know existed until the moment he landed and :chaos: being created because reasons. These are things I thought up 30 seconds after reading your plot post, but assumed they'd been asked by the mods. Hah, was I wrong.   In my honest opinion, a large part of this community is stuck up their arse when it comes to their characters and character development.  If it was an RP we wouldn't have rules for stabbing and such.  If you want a perfect happy ending, write a book. Don't play a game.   Wow, nice to know that the mods care about the effort we're putting into this game.   Everyone has spent time creating characters in this game and I very much doubt there are many sociopaths running about IRL just looking for people to kill. The fact that you can kill someone's main character with little to no reason is positively atrocious. Allow it to happen over and over again and you'll find yourself with a dead sub in no time. Not to mention you clearly know nothing about RPs if you think there aren't rules for stabbing people.  I think it's pretty obvious from your posts that you're 100% for powergaming. For whatever reason, you have this need to win even though ""winning"" is almost impossible given our game and the setting that was chosen. IMO, you need to set aside your personal biases when you're moderating and look at what's good for the sub. If you think it'll lead to anything other than salt and unclaiming then you're delusional."

He hadn't talked much with the other children, preferring to sit in the library or wander the courtyard. He would much rather be in either of those places- or even watching his two burbling brothers- than attend some dinner party, but Sarra Reed had other plans- and so attend he must.

He knew he was supposed to rise out to meet them, but he was a craven, and stayed behind the gate.   ""Who goes?"" he shouted at the party... Who goes? he thought to himself. Gods I am going to get it! For thousands of years it was tradition that the Knight of the Gate would greet everyone who approached with 'Who would pass the Bloody Gate?' and then allow the party to announce themselves. He could already hear the sniggering of the men standing beside him. Oh damn! Others take me for my foolishness!  The answer came back: ""Lord Jason Mallister, I have come to speak to your liege lord.""  317 composed himself. A riverlord. A vassal to the Tullys, the Lord Protector will want to see him.  ""Greetings milord, welcome to the Vale! Any man of the Riverlands is welcome here, and great lords all the more! You may pass, the Lord Protector is at the Gates of the Moon if you wish to speak with him!""  He motioned at the men who stood beside the gate winch, and with a groan they began to turn. Slowly, creaking metal ringing through the cold winter air, the Bloody Gate was drawn open.    [m] So as you know Jon Arryn is dead, his son Osric Arryn is Lord of the Vale, but he's 11, so there's currently a regent, the Lord Protector Elbert Arryn. Also, the Eyrie is abandoned because of winter, so any actual meeting will be at the Gates of the Moon. And Aerion Waters is part of the Arryn claim, so that makes things a lot simpler."
IronThronePowers,3dye2u,scortenraad,2,Mon Jul 20 16:28:55 2015 UTC,"Lord Jason thanked 317 as they passed, and led his small host up the winding path to the Gates of the Moon, where he would find the Lord Protector wintering with his family. The air grew thin and cold as they ascended, and the wind howled against the great stone teeth of the Vale. Jason was glad that he had left Marla and their son in Seagard. He had thought of bringing them to ease the introduction with Lord Protector Elbert, but he had not wanted to risk their health in harsh winter travel.  The group rode wordlessly up the rocky path until it gave way to the great clearing where the Gates of the Moon had been built thousands of years past. Its tremendous stone walls stood proudly in the pale winter sun, and Jason spied a handful of sentries within the parapets, wrapped in great wooly skins.  ""Hail,"" he called out to them. ""I am Lord Jason Mallister here to speak to Lord Protector Elbert, and to see my son, if he is within."""
IronThronePowers,3dye2u,scortenraad,2,Mon Jul 20 16:56:38 2015 UTC,"""Aye milord! We'll take you right to him!"" The guard called back, and the gate was opened.  Right to him was easier said than done. At the entrance to the keep they were greeted by a steward and a serving man holding a dish of bread and salt. The retainers were escorted to the Great Hall, where they were given refreshment. The Lord of Seagard was escorted up to the upper levels, where the family apartments and library were.  Jason Mallister was taken to the private solar of the Lord of the Vale, a large room, handsomely furnished, with a spectacular view of the snow-capped Mountains of the Moon, and the Eyrie standing atop the Giant's Lance. A large fire roared in the hearth, and the Lord Protector sat there alone on a plush chair, a book in his hand. He rose as the steward opened the door and announced the visitor.  ""My Lord Mallister,"" Elbert said, striding over to shake hands with the Lord of Seagard. ""I had a raven from my men at the Bloody Gate saying you were to join us, you are most welcome. Few men brave the High road in wintertime, and we are always pleased to receive visitor, especially those of your stature.""  He motioned at a set of low, blue velvet couches and the spread that lay on a table nearby- small lemon cakes delicately brushed with honey and sprinkled with nuts, raspberry tartlets with fresh cream, and a few smaller dishes bearing roast almonds, olives cured in brine, and some other delicacies. There was spiced cider, mulled wine, and Arbor gold available to drink, from large carafes that rested at the center of the low, small table.   Elbert waited for Lord Jason to settle himself before continuing.   ""Would you care for some refreshment, my Lord? I know all too well how taxing the journey can be. What brings you to the Gates of the Moon in winter?"""
IronThronePowers,3dye2u,scortenraad,2,Mon Jul 20 17:35:19 2015 UTC,"""Spiced wine would be most welcome,"" Jason said, glancing at a nearby cupbearer. ""The road was even colder than I imagined. But House Arryn seems no worse for the winter, my lord.""  Jason approached the couches, but hesitated. What he was here to say was better said standing. But do I refuse my host's hospitality? he thought. Do I refuse my aching legs? He sat after all, and thanked the cupbearer who brought him a generous pour of mulled wine.  ""Lord Elbert, I thank you for your hospitality, truly. Would that every winter day greeted me with such finery. As for my purpose, I am here to inquire after my son, and to see him, if he is with you here."""
IronThronePowers,3dye2u,scortenraad,2,Mon Jul 20 18:15:10 2015 UTC,"Elbert's brow furrowed ever so slightly at this. ""Of course my Lord, I can have Aerion summoned here at once. I believe he is currently having lessons in the library with the other children."" He motioned at a steward, who quickly left the room.   Elbert took a sip of his own cup of mulled wine. ""I do wish your Lordship had sent us some advance warning of your arrival my Lord. It is not small matter for a boy of six to meet his father for the first time. I would have given me the opportunity to speak with Aerion first, and explain matters to him, as well as things can be explained to a boy his age."""
IronThronePowers,3dye2u,scortenraad,2,Mon Jul 20 18:35:32 2015 UTC,"Jason's eyes narrowed. ""I have acknowledged Aerion as my son before gods and men. I sent ravens to every corner of the realm. I would ask why this news has been kept from him, and what he has been told in its place.  ""I also corresponded with the late Lord Arryn on this matter, and wished to take custody of young Aerion then. Lord Jon refused me, citing concerns for Queen Rhaella's visitation and the child's upbringing. I have those letters here."" He reached within his blue quilted doublet and produced a clutch of letters, written in Maester Brandon's even hand.  ""I deferred to Lord Jon out of a deep respect for his wisdom, and I wished to spare my son—then a babe—the rigors of a long journey.

It these things I would've broached with your child, and explained to him. These are not matters I would normally discus with a boy of six, would you?

IronThronePowers,3dyj2q,pauix,2,Mon Jul 20 16:03:00 2015 UTC,"Such a long journey it had been; at least, it had felt as much. Elenei had spent most of it watching the sun sweep across the sky, leaving oranges and reds in her wake. It somehow reminded her of Gormon.   Starfall had been chaotic; one moment she was filled with excitement, the next she was filled with terror. She'd held Arlan's hand, clinging tightly for fear she'd never hold it again. They hadn't spoken afterwards - they didn't have time. All she had wanted was to talk to him. And tell him of the melee. He'll be proud of me, Arly always is. Instead she had a whimpering, little girl curled up in her lap. Puzzled, Elenei instinctively began stroking her long, coppery hair. She'd seen Arlan's mother do it once, after he'd fallen and began to cry. She couldn't recall anyone ever comforting her like that.    Elenei was asleep when they arrived, arms loosely wrapped around the little girl whose tears had since ceased. The past month had been exhausting and she hadn't been sleeping properly, eager to remain awake and train rather than sleep and fall into the hands of nightmares. She slept soundly, however. Perhaps because she wasn't sleeping alone."
IronThronePowers,3dyj2q,lobelias,2,Mon Jul 20 16:49:08 2015 UTC,"As soon as the walls of Godsgrace were in sight, Arlan sighed of relief. Adhira and Adura would be able to have someone their age to play with in order to keep themselves distracted from not having their father around, which meant Lythene would probably be free enough time for him to ask about the events that had transpired in Starfall, specifically about his father. He had seen uncle Baldric and the one-eyed knight along with the men that had the same sigil than Ser Rolland, so he knew they would all be fine, but he had not seen Edric. Father will be fine. He's the hero of the Mad Crow's defiance. Heroes can't die.  His train of thought was distracted when the girl in Elenei's arms started to mutter something in her sleep. Not wanting his sister to wake up, he moved next to her in order to pick little Adhira (or was it Adura? he could not tell them from each other no matter how much he tried) from her arms, until he managed to understand what was she saying in her dreams.  ""...father... I'm scared....""  Of course. She's dreaming about her father. With a sad smile, he lifted his arms in order to take the girl from Elenei's lap, accidentally waking her up."
IronThronePowers,3dyj2q,lobelias,3,Mon Jul 20 17:39:22 2015 UTC,"The little girl had been acting as a teddy to Elenei, so it came as a shock when she was taken away. Immediately, Elenei's eyes flickered open; fingers curling around Arlan's wrist tightly. Whoops. It's Arly. Embarrassed, her hand slunk away. ""Sorry Arly. I didn't know it was you."" As he lifted the girl from her lap, Elenei sat up and rubbed at her sleepy eyes.   ""We're here?"" Her silvery gaze fluttered around the new surroundings, taking in the scenery. Here we'll be safe. Now we just need father. ...and Ser Rolland. But they'll be okay, because they're brave and strong and I believe in them. Running her fingertips through her dishevelled, golden hair, Elenei yawned. ""Arly, how... How long will we be here for? And when with f-..."" Pausing, her eyes flickered over the girls. Wishing not to upset them, she crawled closer to Arlan and whispered, ""When will father be here with us?"""
IronThronePowers,3dyj2q,lobelias,2,Mon Jul 20 17:59:54 2015 UTC,"The girl in his arms kept moving for a few seconds, threatening to wake up, so Arlan did what he had seen aunt Lyth do when the kids were having nightmares. Gently bouncing his little cousin in his arms, he tried to calm her down using the softest voice he could manage to make. 'Sssshhhh. It's alright. Father is busy.' The girl seemed to complain about father being busy in her dreams, but she eventually calmed down enough for Arlan to lay her down in the ground, her head resting on his knee, and turned his attention towards Elenei.  ""Last time I saw him, father was with the foreigner"" As if he was revealing the secret of Valyrian steel to the only person worthy of them, Arlan had leaned towards her, speaking only with a whisper. ""The one who dresses in red and uses fire swords.""   Arlan did not know what to think of the foreign priest. He had never understood his weird religion, but the man seemed to be very strong and good with swords. I hope father's fine with him."
IronThronePowers,3dyj2q,lobelias,2,Mon Jul 20 18:14:45 2015 UTC,"To see Arlan calm the girl gave Elenei a fuzzy feeling in her stomach. Am I sick? It tickles. Diverting her attention back to his voice, she leant in closer to hear him. ""The foreigner?"" As he went on to explain, Elenei sat back on her feet as she pondered. ""I've seen them once, but they never spoke to me."" She paused. ""They scare me. I don't like how they play with fire. Will father be okay?"" Wide, silvery eyes gazed into Arlan's as she awaited his answer. Of course he'll be okay. It's father, and father can do anything. Just like me and Arly. I just... need to hear it from him. Just to make sure. Arly wouldn't lie."
IronThronePowers,3dyj2q,lobelias,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:37:01 2015 UTC,"Arlan did not know what would happen to his father, but as soon as her eyes fell on him pleading for reassurance he found himself unable to tell her the truth. I should not lie to her, but I have to. The truth would hurt her so much.   ""Everything will be alright."" Even if he tried to sound as confident as possible, the look his sister gave him back made him realize he had failed. Feeling useless for not being able to help her, he carefully pulled her closer to him, trying not to wake the girl sleeping in his lap, and raised his arms around her, and tried to comfort her as he had done with the little girl, stroking her hair as he tried to whisper soothing words in her ears. ""Father is strong, and the foreigner is strong too. They will be fine, Eli, I know it."""

Meanwhile, Lucerys Velaryon and Leyton Hightower began forming a secret faction intent on deposing Rhaegar but preserving the Targaryen dynasty, with their end goal being a great council to install a new child king. They were joined by Hoster Tully and eventually Mace Tyrell and Jon Arryn. When Queen Aelinor died suddenly, Lucerys snapped and took King's Landing, imprisoning Rhaegar, and called a Great Council to determine whether Rhaegar would remain king. Before the lords arrived to the council, however, Rhaegar killed himself under house arrest.  Delonne Allyrion told the small council that she had discovered that the Dornish delegation to the great council, along with Prince Corlys, Rhaegar's younger son, had been kidnapped by pirates in the Stepstones, hired by the Lannisters. Leyton Hightower learned from an ally in the West that Tywin was planning to attack the Great Council. This information led Lucerys, Mace, Leyton, Gilwood Hunter, Jon Arryn, and Hoster Tully to order a midnight raid by the Goldcloaks on Tywin's manse, with the intent of capturing him. Instead, the raid was botched and Tywin got enough warning to fight back; he was killed in the ensuing chaos.  The Great Council continued with Tywin dead but the western delegation imprisoned, and Baelor, Rhaegar's eldest son, was elected king. Three regents were also elected- Yohn Royce, Lucerys Velaryon, and Leyton Hightower.  At the same time, the Stormlands were dealing with the fallout of Jocelyn Baratheon being exposed as a probable bastard of Rhaegar (one of the other reasons he was deposed). The girl was 'murdered' (or so the realm thinks); soon afterwards Brandon Stark arrived and murdered Stannis Baratheon in a duel.  Other major deaths during the reign of Baelor II have included Jon Arryn ('old age', probably poison), Leyton Hightower ('bowel cancer', probably poison), and Mace Tyrell (poison).  In the Riverlands specifically, two conflicts have recently been brewing: renewed fighting over Pennytree by Bracken and Blackwood, and skirmishes and raids between Frey and Reed. Relations with the north are terrible, while relations with the crown are decent (though Bracken is mad that people spend more time talking than putting a solution into action)."

""I had hoped I'd heard the last of that name outside of the Iron Isles. If you have something to say, just fucking say it,"" his tone altered greatly. It seemed more aggressive, his hand had moved to the hilt of his blade. The name struck a nerve. The Farwynds had been destroying the reputation of the Iron Isles for years. It seemed to be a hobby."
IronThronePowers,3dwnca,Morgris,2,Mon Jul 20 04:57:14 2015 UTC,"""Uh yes well it seems that the Farwynd's manage a brothel here in Kings Landing"" Petyr said trying not to break the gaze of the Ironborn. ""Now such a thing seems to get some on the small council but the Sweet Sound Port tends to cater to a more taboo fare."" Dalton's look was getting angrier so Petyr thought better of drawing out the speech.  ""The brothel has been known to cater to some unusual requests including body doubles of the Royal family and other great houses"" Petyr said as seriously as he could manage."
IronThronePowers,3dwnca,hewhoknowsnot,2,Mon Jul 20 05:10:53 2015 UTC,"Dalton relaxed at the mention of the Sweet Sound Port. ""I've known about that place for some time. I believe Quellon even had a body double of his own. I heard he had many more than just that as well. Luckily I was spared from such a disgrace,"" he responded in a much calmer tone."
IronThronePowers,3dwnca,rollme,2,Mon Jul 20 05:17:28 2015 UTC,"Damn  ""I am glad I am not the one to break the news to you my Lord. I feared you may doubt me from the sheer madness of it all."" Petyr feigned ""Although I do not wish to be around if his grace were to hear of this for the first time. A brothel with doubles of his dead mother and father might enrage the young King"" Petyr said"

IronThronePowers,3dwfsx,Tolwynne,2,Mon Jul 20 03:59:22 2015 UTC,"[m] Oh, so we're calling it the Bloody Wedding? Alright then. A bit bland for my taste, but I'll take it."
IronThronePowers,3dwfsx,Tolwynne,2,Mon Jul 20 02:56:16 2015 UTC,Hmm... I know.. Here. I'll try harder this time...   The Massacre of Starfall  The Purple Wedding (Dayne's colors are purple)  One Fine Day in Starfall  Leave it to Euron  God these are awful... You have any suggestions?

IronThronePowers,3dvq9f,jonnyw3,5,Sun Jul 19 22:48:35 2015 UTC,"There was a good chance that Ryon was going to have some emotional issues with jousting.   [Meta]: I laughed, I cried, I lamented. Good death."
IronThronePowers,3dvq9f,thestaticwizard,3,Sun Jul 19 23:01:13 2015 UTC,Ryon and Daemon both :(
IronThronePowers,3dvq9f,MournSigil,3,Mon Jul 20 00:49:46 2015 UTC,"m: Rest in peace, lovely lore, sad moment"
IronThronePowers,3dvq9f,Krulthewarriorking,3,Sun Jul 19 23:21:01 2015 UTC,Dammit...
IronThronePowers,3dvq9f,MournSigil,3,Mon Jul 20 00:16:42 2015 UTC,I'm reading this for maybe the fiftieth time and...I refuse to accept this :(
IronThronePowers,3dvq9f,MournSigil,3,Mon Jul 20 12:20:34 2015 UTC,"Think of it this way, you lose a baby daddy but gain a lemur. But seriously though fuck rollme!"
IronThronePowers,3dvq9f,MournSigil,2,Mon Jul 20 12:29:33 2015 UTC,That really doesn't make me feel any better.   And so it was that the Allyrion women began their quest to outlaw jousting...
IronThronePowers,3dvq9f,2OP4me,2,Mon Jul 20 13:17:03 2015 UTC,:( I never wanted it like this.
IronThronePowers,3dvq9f,pauix,2,Mon Jul 20 01:28:35 2015 UTC,"[m] As if I needed more reasons to dislike Jousting ic... that was really well written, congratulations. :'("
