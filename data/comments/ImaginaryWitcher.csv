He never carries a weapon, he uses his hands or his dragon abilities, the only weapons he has are 2 Zerikannian women. He also has amazing hair. I want him to return in The Witcher 3 expansions."

ImaginaryWitcher,3cg3qb,VALAR_M0RGHUL1S,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:51:17 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Artist must have taken some liberties with placing these locations. Aedd Gynvael, for example, is located further to the east on the 'official' map (which was made 'together' with Sapkowski).  The true/exact location of many of these places were also never mentioned in the books. Montecalvo and Stygga being prime examples.  I suppose there's no harm in filling it in by one's own imagination. After all, there's a lack of 'official' resources.  Would've been nice if a different color was used for the fonts, as it's hard to read some of these names. Still, as a whole, nicely done. The heraldry looks great."

ImaginaryWitcher,3bj8rx,VALAR_M0RGHUL1S,3,Mon Jun 29 17:56:08 2015 UTC,"Image description:   Piece I created for the ongoing Dark Horse Witcher 3 Fan Art Contest. Been wanting to do a scene from the Witcher books for a while and this is the scene from the opening of Blood of Elves where Ciri is having a dream/nightmare about the fall of Cintra. It always conjured a powerful image in my head and I hope i did it justice.  The street is on fire, a roaring red wall of flame. Silhouetted before it, a rider towers over the  flaming roofs, enormous. His black-caparisoned horse prances, tosses its head, neighs.  The rider stares down at her. Ciri sees his eyes gleaming through the slit in his huge helmet,  framed by a bird of prey's wings. She sees the fire reflected in the broad blade of the sword  held in his lowered hand.   The rider looks at her. Ciri is unable to move. The dead man's motionless arms wrapped  around her waist hold her down. She is locked in place by something heavy and wet with  blood, something which is lying across her thigh, pinning her to the ground.   And she is frozen in fear: a terrible fear which turns her entrails inside out, which deafens Ciri  to the screams of the wounded horse, the roar of the blaze, the cries of dying people and the  pounding drums. The only thing which exists, which counts, which still has any meaning, is  fear. Fear embodied in the figure of a black knight wearing a helmet decorated with feathers  frozen against the wall of raging, red flames."

ImaginaryWitcher,38826n,Anthaller,3,Wed Jun 3 01:27:25 2015 UTC,Fun fact: in the books Triss normally doesn't wear revealing necklines because she was badly burned there during the Battle on Sodden. Although I suppose she could just use magic to hide it
