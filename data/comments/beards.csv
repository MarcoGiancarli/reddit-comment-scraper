Fragrance oils are another class of oil besides your carriers and essentials, generally those are used in perfumes and many other cosmetic products found on your drugstore shelves.   While some essential oils and carriers as well, do indeed have a fragrance of their own they're generally softer and not as rich as a much stronger fragrance oil. So that's why most blends of beard oils smell nice for a few hours then seem to fade later in the day. This is all good and well for most of us menfolk.   Of course also you develop a little odor blindness from wearing it after a while too and it may not be as noticeable as when you freshly apply your beard oil."

beards,3e1iga,Fragaholik,4,Tue Jul 21 06:09:28 2015 UTC,"Boars bristle brush - found at most large drugstores.  Kent Comb's found at mens specialty shops or online.  Beard Oils, so many avenues; but try your home ground first - see if your local barber shops, hair salons carry them.  Then if not you can get them online at various websites and etsy shops.   As a last and sometimes first resort; you can learn to make your own. There are DIY guides online to read up and learn all you can about essential oils and carrier oils. The ratios to use, the containers to put them in, the properties of each; and so on.   Supplies can be gotten piecemeal or all in one spendy go, through your local Health Food Shop if you're in an area that has one.

beards,3dzyzo,McFlyin11,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:16:12 2015 UTC,"Actually, I would suggest the opposite. I'd leave most of the length on the chin and have the barber, or yourself if you feel confident, trim the sides gently. This will soften the look of the beard by blending its length to something closer to the side of your head hair. I find that you can still have a decent size beard all-the-while looking professional; unkempt ""sides"" is usually what makes the overall beard look ""bad"". This + beard oil + a boars hair brush and you should be alright so long as your company aren't huge hard asses with facial hair. Hope this helps."
beards,3dzyzo,benman5745,2,Mon Jul 20 22:46:30 2015 UTC,Definitely bring in the sides. Find a good barber and have them do it for you to start then watch the process. Turns you from a bushy mountain man to sleek and slim. It will also make your face look slimmer. I agree with the brush and oils and it keeps some of the curl out and it looking straight and neat.
beards,3dzyzo,theomeny,2,Mon Jul 20 23:24:41 2015 UTC,"As McFlyin said, do the opposite. Have your barber take down the sides and streamline it, but keep the chin length. Like this: cut along the lines."

But that's normal for any couple. Maybe I need to use more conditioner, or change the type of oil because she doesn't like the smell or has reactions to it (allergies) ... things like that are also negotiable.

If you want a long beard I wouldn't bother shaving anything, looks much thicker if you don't trim your neck. Otherwise use your index finger and feel where your jaw is, start with your finger next to the bottom of your ear and do like the ""cut throat"" type thing where you drag your finger under your chin to your other ear, then just shave where your line is. You could also grab your own neck like you're strangling yourself, where your fingers meet your jaw is pretty much where your line should be. But this only works if you've got a really defined jawline."

As for the front, it's up to you how you want to keep the tip of the bottom of your beard. I prefer a rounded look so I cut it that way. Some guys cut straight across for a squared off look or to an even point. Don't do it wet!! For the love of god."

This is based on some Quranic command that on shall not trim the lengths of one's beard. Since nothing is said about width and mustache it's presumed that they are to be trimmed.

Anyway, for people like us, I think as the moustache gets thicker, that gap becomes less noticeable. At this point, some people dont even notice that about me until I point it out.  If you opt for my advice, you need to get a boar bristle brush which will help to push the moustache in the right direction. Also use a heap of moustache wax.

beards,3du7yv,rabbage,4,Sun Jul 19 14:56:11 2015 UTC,"Fine tie job.  Yes, I tie mine most of the time but shorter than yours.  Untied it's about 10-11 inches but gets rather thin for the last couple of inches.  I haven't trimmed in about two years except for extremely small amounts to straighten out the bottom.  For tying, after a shower while the beard is wet I comb and brush into a pony tail under my chin and secure with a plastic hair band made for the purpose.  Then I braid the ponytail and tuck it up and under like you appear to have done and secure it with a couple of hairpins, then lightly spray with men's hairspray and dry on low with a blow dryer.  Good to go--even riding the motorcycle at highway speeds.  I really like the extra dense appearance tying yields.  And I love it when people comment on my ""trim"" job! LOL."

beards,3du7yv,southwade,4,Sun Jul 19 22:41:00 2015 UTC,"When your beard gets longer, sometimes you need/want to have a shorter beard appearance. Tying allows for that without having to cut the beard. The left pic is tied and the right is untied."

As a gay dude playing (eh, played in college, taking break in grad school tbh), I never liked other guys sexualizing it and he is not helping it. Meh, whatevs. He could be a nice guy.   edit: It may have sounded like I don't like gay guys playing rugby or something, which is not at all what I meant (as I am gay myself and play). I just don't like when my gay friends talk about how sex rugby is (when really, it hurts  like crazy and you don't see your opponent as an object of sexual fantasy, but rather a guy you gotta get through to score or stop from scoring...) and ask all these very sexual questions about my dear sport. He perpetuates that by making porn about rugby he stars in. All I was saying."

Im mixed with caucasian and african american so Ive battled throughout the year on finding a regiment that works for me AND my fianc√©s benefit lol) after shower I have a few beard oils from beard brand and grave before shave. Helps keep it soft and gives it a nice healthy shine and the oils smell AMAZING.  EDIT: I do use a conditioner almost every time too. Sometimes before the coconut oil and honey treatment or after. Just depends how Im feeling that day and how the beard has been ran... the current conditioner Im using is ""The Original Mane 'n Tail Deep Moisturizing Conditioner"" my girl picked it up from her salon... the girls told her that I'll fall in love with it.. Only used it 3 or 4 times so far... ehhhh... Ill keep pushing it for a bit. It does smell good and it definitely helps straighten my super curly hair."""

Lifting weights may sound like some sort of stigma within the burly society of beards and chest hair; but it's legit.  Protein and Biotin promote healthier, faster hair growth."

It has these clumps of beeswax in it that end up there no matter how I heat it or cool it.   Anyways, It has:  Cocoa butter  Shea butter (more cocoa than shea, I hate the smell of shea)  Tea tree oil  Argan oil  Beeswax  Jojoba oil  Here is a website with a lot of recipes and ideas: http://www.growabeardnow.com/beard-balm/#recipes  I made mine by mixing together the butters and oils until I liked the smell and feel, then I mixed them 50/50 with beeswax and melted together. I poured it into a 4oz mason jar and let cool. It still ended up feeling clumpy, but to get around that I use a small wooden brush and rub the brush into the balm, then brush my beard. The wax gives it some hold and makes it easier to shape, and the oils and butters make it feel baby soft.  If there is anyone that makes their own beard balm with beeswax, can you give me any tips on how to avoid the clumpy texture? I have tried heating the oils and waxes separately. I also tried to heat them for 20+ minutes and cool quickly. Nothing has worked so far."

The only time I even smell it is when I open up the jar, once that is closed again I can't tell.  2) Oil might help with dandruff but you probably need to get some shampoo/conditioner that fights dandruff. Head and shoulders 2 in 1 is great for that.   Good luck."
beards,3dnghb,average_white_male,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:53:10 2015 UTC,"I have coconut oil in my beard now. I can definitely smell it. It's not overpowering, just not one of my favorite smells, and I was looking to make it a little more enjoyable to smell all day.  I've had problems with dandruff on my scalp so I use Head&Shoulders. I've tied it in my beard with no luck. I've also tried Selsun Blue with no luck. I used to use T-Gel, which is coal tar shampoo, that kind of worked for my head, but it really dried out my hair so I was skeptical about using it in my beard"
beards,3dnghb,dan-theman,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:01:04 2015 UTC,All of those shampoos you listed were pretty good at causing dandruff for me.   If your coconut oil has been filtered then it will not smell at all. Try a different company. I put it in a pump dispenser so I can apply it on the skin under my beard and it has been working great for me.
beards,3dnghb,nogrim2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:14:57 2015 UTC,"I just bought a tub of organic, extra virgin, (I assume) unfiltered coconut oil. I'd like to try to use up some of this before switching brands. I'd just like to alter the smell if possible."
beards,3dnghb,DrEmilioLazardo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:18:52 2015 UTC,"generally beard dandruff is caused by too much shampoo/conditioner not being completely rinsed off. try rinsing it a bit more and see if that changes anything after a few days.  i avoid washing my beard more than once every few days, i also add teatree oil to the coconut oil, which keeps everything disinfected and helps, although its got a stronger smell than the coconut oil.  i have heard grape seed oil is also a good option"

Health food stores have the oils you need, pick something up each pay day until you have a nice starter kit ... learn all you can about each one's properties, and ratios to use, and not just for your beard blends alone but for other applications as well; aroma therapy, and hundreds of other beneficial uses for body, health, and home.    Meanwhile, continue to purchase comercial versions from your local barbershops / salons, or online venues like Etsy for special occasions and the like until you're confident in your ability to consistently make your own after much experimentation and research.    Keep in mind safety uppermost for yourself, and those around you including household pets.  Perform a 24 hour patch test.  Remember most of these essential oils are external use only; don't attempt to use internally without advice of an accredited health practitioner.  Note: even with commercially produced beard balms - oils - butters, nearly none of them are approved by a health or food and drug administrative body, organization or agency in most places in the world. This is a very lacking IMHO. One of the things I'm hopeful for in the future. The potential for lawsuits is staggering.    Beard On Beard Strong.   TZüçÅ"

After 8 weeks you'll have a great idea of which hairs grow in late (seriously, some of my cheeks didn't really fill in until 4 weeks or so). You'll also have a great idea of whether you have a lot of fine, blonde hair, that needs some density to be seen - it's possible.   If it looks like shit after 8 weeks, trim what you don't like and keep what you do, or stay clean.   Finally, as much as we all love to post beards here, don't aim for anyone's beard. I'm jealous of some people's beards here, and a lot of people are jealous of mine in real life. We, here, are the best of the best when it comes to beards so its a high and daunting standard which has been set.

However, if you google Jeff's Beard Board Patchy Beard Success there is a whole thread of guys that were afraid of their patchiness and ended up with beautiful beards.  If it's any consolation, I think you'll be fine. I'm at 5 weeks with similar density in the cheeks. You have more consistent density along and under your chin with a decent mustache area. You will be fine to just let it go wild. Don't trim anything. I hear 13 weeks is a good amount of time to really start judging what you want to do with it."

beards,3dgcti,_pope_francis,-1,Thu Jul 16 10:30:05 2015 UTC,The frontal portion of the beard is untrimmed cept for minor split ends.  If I let the sides grow out they'd grow soo damn far down past the center.  My chops grow like mad and it would not work in my corporate environment.  So forgive me if my definition of a yeard slightly alters from this sub's definition.  I am still happy I have come this far :)

Always had mom to do it back in the day. My wife does it now. Both were hair stylist but never did anything with a beard. My wife trimmed it once by taking a 2 guard all over :-(.   Just a few questions to make it easier on the barber and me when I go.    What should I expect? What should I ask for?  I want to keep growing it but I also want it cleaned up a bit for the wife.  Any suggestions for the hair cut?  My wife hates cutting the cowlick on my forehead. I just go with a short fohawk now.

If however, you had the beard before the relationship, and that is how she accepted you, then she is on thin ice. How about her hair - would you prefer it to be a pageboy cut?

beards,3dfafb,JPADGE,10,Wed Jul 15 20:35:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, by /r/beards standards; as outlined in the side bar ...    What's a Yeard?  A Yeard is 1 year of full beard natural untrimmed beard growth. Cleaning up the neck line below the adam's apple and cheek line is allowed. Untrimmed moustaches are encouraged but not required.   So, by this definition. You just have a beard that you have maintained for a year. It's not a yeard.   Beard On Beard Strong.   TZüçÅ"

beards,3dbxkz,Pandemic_Panda,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:44:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info.  Did you trim or neaten at all during those initial months?  So far, I have trimmed once (approx 6mm extender on a trimmer) but I have just primarily neatened around the neckline.  Should I continue that or stay away from it completely until it fills in?"
beards,3dbxkz,CrippledHorses,2,Wed Jul 15 02:48:17 2015 UTC,"I personally didn't trim at all until around 4 or 5 months. I would definitely keep your neck clean however. Also, a good beard balm never hurt, since it keeps your beard looking and feeling nice. Once it starts getting long enough, combing it helps to tame it until you do get it trimmed."

If you're going to be with a company that wants a lot of client/engineer relations IE a salesman you're going to have to look the part which is a salesman.  I really hate the idea that someone doesn't look professional with a beard.  I've seen a lot of schlubs who look like total nasty goons without beards.  It's all in how you carry yourself.

I'm at the point now where my beard is sort of a social filter. Anyone who has a problem with it probably wouldn't be a good fit for me professionally, anyways.

Within my systems team, there are a lot of different roles. Some of us deal with the hardware, some of us deal with storage, or file servers, or exchange, or vmware/citrix, some of us deal with windows OS more, some of us deal with AD/domain tasks, some of us deal with particular app servers, etc. Some of the tasks can be boring, but overall i wouldn't say the job is boring.   I like it. I know how to work with people, and I understand the logic behind how the systems work, and how to accomplish the task that the business needs via technology. I'm doing more automation work, so now I'm wishing I had a programming background, but luckily i know enough math to limp along and learn as i go. lots of people i have worked with were programmers first. If you understand the lowest level of operation of a computer, it makes understanding the rest of the job easier, most move on to security roles, the programming is very useful in that role."

This is just to shape it into it's resting place.  My beard is quite bushy. See here and here, so it's appearance seems to be slightly different from day to day. Which also depends on how dry and humid it is. I do oil a lot.   You should try letting yours grow out a bit more maybe another two months and try shaping it and see how it is then for you too?"

The fact that you took some time out of your day to share such an awesomely-phrased and genuinely heartfelt pick-me-up with a stranger in need says droves about you. I feel like we'd enjoy a beer together. Although it felt contrived, and weirdly narcissistic to put out a request for some kindness into the ether like this, you sir have delivered. Know that I'll come back to your words for inspiration and support over the coming weeks and months, and that these fucking awesome words were exactly what I needed to hear right now.   Thank you friend. Thank you very, very much."

I know how you feel. I've lost the most important person in my life, and it ruined me for a solid year. She left me when I was unemployed and out of money, only to start a relationship with a new guy less than 24 hours later. I worked two full time jobs at the same time for 20 hours a day to make sure my bills were paid, and basically suffered loving and being in love with a person that would not and could not be in my life anymore -while she dangled her new man and life in front of me, marrying him just six months after our 3 years.  I used all my feelings of betrayal, sadness, anger, and heartbroken-ness and all the horrible things she said to me to drive myself to where i am now. it'll get better, but it'll never be the same. don't lose the part of yourself that knows how to love another human being, and dwelling on what could've been different distracts you from what experiences you could be having and memories you could be making with people that won't leave when things get tough.  i don't know you, but i have faith in you."

A year and a half after I last saw her. Wanting us to find a way to transcend the distance once more. Me ready to do it all again, her unsure if she can. The TL;DR version is that she's too scared to make any new plan because of what that might, and might not mean in the long term. She'd rather not make a plan and not be scared, than try something and take a risk. It's the antithesis of how I am, but I don't blame her for a second. This shit's hard, and she's been as brave as I at times.  So, it's time to let go. Because I love both of us."

I was in a terrible on-off relationship for years, abusive, just...a mess. And I never was a mess of a person before him. I met a wonderful man a year and a half ago, with a mighty beard of his own (my first bearded suitor), who scooped me up and repaired the damage one by one, and I did the same for him. I've never known love in this way and now I see how much time I wasted so many times before on those who were utterly undeserving. We got married last month.  Things turn around, they get better. Take some time off, get to know yourself, decide what you bring to the party as well as what you need from it, and settle for absolutely nothing less. All the hugs."

The interesting thing with this one is that it felt like all the others had just been rehearsals to prepare me for this. So if this one wasn't the great love, the next one's going to be a doozy! Time will tell I guess.   I'm really glad to hear you found someone to help you make sense of the scars. Those people are so special. Extra points that he has a beard too!"
beards,3d4omw,goinpostal71,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:24:06 2015 UTC,"Every relationship, in a perfect world, should propel us towards something better. It should be a staircase leading up, not down and not to the side. So even if some things sucked and weren't great, those things help refine what you want and don't want in the future. And things that were great are things that you can put in the ""must have"" category.   That bad relationship I spoke of earlier? I'd never laughed with someone so much. It was a must-have. So were the intellectual debates and affinity for dress up nights with great food and drink. Those were things I took away from that experience and knew I'd really like to have again...just not with him. And so they became priorities in their own ways, and I have them now. Fortunately though, all the other crap was ditched and became ""must not have ever again in any circumstance"".   These are all great learning moments and as long as you're moving forward and not stagnating or heaven forbid moving backwards, you're doing alright."

You giving yourself permission to let someone go is one of the hardest hurdles in life so give yourself credit for even starting that process. Then remember this, it's all temporary. Never let that little demon lord voice convince you that it'll always feel this shitty, because it never will. Surround yourself with people who constantly make you feel safe and who remind you that you are loved. And also surround yourself with laughter. If you stop laughing, the world gets much scarier (I lost my mom 18 months ago, so I know this first hand).  You can do this beard brother! Just wish her well and move along your journey. It's cliche but you WILL find someone who makes everyone else feel like they were just trial runs. Have faith, and have fun!  LF"

beards,3d9qw4,ihatereddittrulyido,3,Tue Jul 14 16:36:00 2015 UTC,"Have you tried just not using anything for a week or two?  Your skin may be in a sort of ""distress"" with all of the stuff you're throwing at it.  Soaps that you get from the big stores usually contain ingredients that are very drying to your skin.  This causes your skin to over-produce its natural oil (sebum).  So adding beard oil to the mix isn't helping things at this point.  Try this soap: http://www.smokymountainbeards.com/collections/beard_soap/products/soap_black-willow  It has several active ingredients that help with acne.  It's a mild, all naturally-derived ingredient soap.  Has a great smell too."
beards,3d9qw4,ClarkW_Griswold,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:48:00 2015 UTC,"Well, for several weeks all I used was beard oil. Since that didn't work, I went back to washing my face with face wash every other morning. That seemed to give the lightest results I guess.   Here is the face wash I use. I read that it was really good at being very neutral on everything."
beards,3d9qw4,ClarkW_Griswold,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:30:41 2015 UTC,There is still alcohols and parabens.  These can be irritants to some people.
beards,3d9qw4,tyler9090,2,Tue Jul 14 18:06:23 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you need to use more specific beard oil. Something that contains hazelnut or cedarwood will help with acne, while sweet almond or eucalyptus stops inflamation and ingrown hairs. I use about a dime in my hand and rub into the roots of my beard every morning. It's possible that's the type you use already, but worth a shot"
