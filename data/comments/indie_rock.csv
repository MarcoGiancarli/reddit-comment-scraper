indie_rock,3e5pqn,Oldebones,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:57:43 2015 UTC,Pretty cool some of the melodies remind me of Oberhofer. I like how the first three songs change the melody near the ends.
indie_rock,3e5pqn,TheShoveler,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:50:13 2015 UTC,"Not bad for a first release.  Here's some feedback (keep in mind this is me really nit-picking. You guys are jamming and I love it).  Put some distance between the bass line and the guitar on fanfare and those transitions in Coyote. Remember, a chord in its most basic definition is supposed to bridge the gap between the bass note and the melody. It's starts to feel really muddled if you don't have a solid bass part beneath it.  Silence is just as important as sound. Don't be afraid to get quiet before you get loud. You do a pretty good job of this on tornado and Empress, but dynamics can really set you apart from the crowd these days.  Oh and if you go into a studio to record higher quality versions of the songs, don't be afraid to change the songs. You aren't sacrificing your artistic integrity and you won't confuse fans. If you hire an audio engineer listen to his advice on songs. If he thinks you have 1 too many choruses on a song, take that chorus out unless you have a good reason for keeping it in. You don't need to follow his instructions word for word, but if he has some input, ponder that shit!  Nice listen though. Definitely downloading."

indie_rock,3e00kh,nanowerx,2,Tue Jul 21 17:03:30 2015 UTC,Loving these new Foals songs. What Went Down is probably my favorite song of 2015! this one is pretty good too.

indie_rock,3dosy7,atticus138,3,Sat Jul 18 00:53:10 2015 UTC,This album is fun but way too short. All it did was make me more eager for another Cloud Nothings album.

Constant frisson reading the lyrics. And it evolved perfectly for me, And Our Hearts Did Beat and River were the obvious standouts when I first heard it but I've come to adore every song on the record and there were periods where each one became my favorite.   it's every single nostalgic second of my teenage years condensed into ~48 minutes"

indie_rock,3d8z3u,Area44,4,Tue Jul 14 12:58:21 2015 UTC,"Saw these guys open for Ryan Adams last month. They were really good, but their set was only five or six songs. Bad weather was on the way, and I think the venue cut their set short to ensure Ryan Adams had time to play. Adams was still cut short, but both bands were great and I have no regrets. You never know what's going to happen at Redrocks.  Edit: apostrophes are tricky"

indie_rock,3d8z3u,JGladney,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:10:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the rain actually seemed pretty fitting. Ryan played for over an hour before lightning shut things down.

They're not just the main event, at this time, they're the only event.   Their show was recently scheduled so maybe Houndmouth is still looking for another band. Part of me wants to write to them with suggestions, ""please ask the Mowgli's to come to NJ with you."""
