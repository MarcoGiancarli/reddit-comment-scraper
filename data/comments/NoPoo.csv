NoPoo,3e5mrp,bobvo1996,2,Wed Jul 22 03:30:36 2015 UTC,"Conditioner can be used to rinse hair like shampoo can, it just takes a little physical scrubbing of the scalp with the product instead of relying on a higher pH, oil binding ingredients, and surfactants (foaming agents) to lift oil and dirt from the hair. Shampoo uses those ingredients because they make cleaning convenient and quick, but they also overdo this by stripping all of the natural oils (a certain level of oil is protective) from the scalp and hair. Conditioner has a lower pH and closes the cuticle layer of the hair to prevent it from staying open, as well as moisturizes the scalp.  A special note about curly/wavy hair, it is dryer by nature of its weaker physical structure, and a lot of the time curls or waves are dehydrated by shampoos and not restored enough by conditioners. I have wavy-almost-curly hair and cowash (conditioner wash) once a week and use DevaCurl's No Poo followed by One Condition once a week. To cowash, you need to make sure you distribute the product all across your scalp by making sure you touch every part. I can always tell when I've missed touching a spot because I get itchy, usually I just get my hands a little wet and rub the itchy spots with the pads of my fingers to distribute the oil. I don't brush because I wear my hair curly.  J.R. Liggett's, Maple Hill Naturals, and Knotty Boy are all no poo friendly shampoo bars available in the US. LUSH also makes a few options, but you want to make sure you're reading ingredients and getting ones that don't have sulfates, sulfosuccinates, sulfoacetates, etc."

NoPoo,3e2i0b,ema1237,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:14:03 2015 UTC,"You seem to be experiencing the transition period of no poo, wen your hair can be very greasy. The length of this period differs from person to person. For me it took surprisingly little time - less than a week - when I tried to go water only. Before that, I was using baking soda for a year (but found out that baking soda destroys your hair because of its alkaline/high pH). I would like to tell you about my transition period.   My hair became oily and sticky from the oil. I would run my fingers through my hair (long hair) and my fingers would come out oily. My scalp felt dirty and greasy. It bothered me so much that I also made a post here wondering what to do about it, because the sticky greasiness was making it hard to put my hair in a ponytail, and I was having to wash my hands after handling my hair because it was THAT oily.   I did have a boat bristle brush (BBB) which is supposed to be used to distribute the oil away from your scalp. I was using mine and it wasn't helping. Then I found from a blog that BBBs are supposed to be washed or it won't be as effective. I washed it with diluted dish soap, being careful not to wet the wooden handle. When the brush was clean, I used it for maybe 1-2 minutes. I think I only used it once. I changed my pillow case. My hair continued to be greasy for a few more days. Then one day I woke up and it was not greasy. I found it extremely odd. It was so NOT greasy that even if I rubbed my fingers on my scalp, my fingers wouldn't be that oily and they wouldn't smell scalpy. It was as if somebody had secretly washed my hair overnight with soap when I was sleeping. I was blown away by how it could go from feeling filthy and greasy to suddenly feeling like I had just shampooed. My hair was even less greasy than back when I shampooed.   Your results may vary. But if you really want to do water only, consider wether or not you want to wait a little longer for your transition period. It's different for everyone."

NoPoo,3dz482,charliecfoxtrot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:12:45 2015 UTC,"Hey! I haven't heard a lot of good things about Lush products as far as nopoo goes. As far as I can tell, they market their products as all-natural and hair-friendly, but actually can cause buildup/strip your hair like generic shampoo/conditioner. If you're just starting out, I'd suggest cowashing with an approved conditioner (see sidebar). If you're in the states, Shea Moisture is a popular brand, and has been praised by many nopooers (plus it's cheaper than lush, will last you a long time, and smells lovely).  As far as my own hair care, I stave away from all hair products (besides my trusty no-cone conditioner), and cowash once or twice a week. I don't use ACV or BS, because I have a sneaking suspicion that it will throw off the natural balance of my hair (some people swear by it, but all hair types are different). If my ends are dry, I'll add a touch of coconut oil to the ends, and/or brush with a BBB.   Basically, the lush bars might not kill your hair or anything, but I wouldn't trust them in the long run. I'd suggest to try cowashing for awhile, and see how that suits you. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask."

I usually just use a BS paste if I feel that I have a lot of build up in my hair (which is usually dry shampoo) and exfoliate my scalp. I always follow with ACV.   If you're interested in low-poo, Trader Joe's has some nice shampoos (my favorite is the tea tree tingle) for pretty cheap. I prefer them over castille soap.

While you could dilute it dramatically with water to cut down on the stripping impacts from the glycerin, and to raise the pH slightly to match your hair, it's just not going to work well over time.    Glycerin will act as a solvent towards the sebum in your hair which is the main problem here."

NoPoo,3dlkih,penguinsk2,5,Fri Jul 17 06:44:27 2015 UTC,"I'm using the routine from the Ultimate water-only guide that was in the sidebar. It works very well for me. Sadly the blog isn't up anymore. So I will explain it here:   Let your hair get a greasy before you wash it. It doesn't have to be super greasy but you shouldn't wash it if it's still clean. Thoroughly massage your scalp with your fingertips (do not scratch with your fingernails). Really apply some pressure to your scalp and rub it. You want to loosen all that oil and dead skin. When you're finished your arms should be pretty tired. The tutorial also said to section your hair for this step. I don't really know how that means. I believe you have to do that if you have long hair so your hair doesn't get in your way or something. Pull the oil through your hair by running 2 fingers in your hair, press them together flat, and then pull them down your hair. Thoroughly brush your hair to distribute the oils further through your hair. Most people use a boar bristle brush for that but I would recommend that you use a sisal brush and/or a wooden brush (I know sisal is wood as well, but you know what I mean right) because they are vegan and work just fine for me (Why use something non-vegan if good alternatives exist?). If you use a sisal brush or a bbb you also have to apply some pressure so to not only run the brush over your hair but through your hair and also to brush your scalp. Shower using very warm water. While showering repeat step 2 while focusing the water at where you're currently massaging. I use the one-stream, high pressure mode of our shower head at this step. That way I can save some water and still have a lot of water where I need it. Turn the water to very cold for like 7 seconds then turn it off. If that's too cold for you, take a step back such that the water only rinses your hair but doesn't run over your whole body. Dry your hair carefully using one of your old cotton t-shirts. That's supposed to be more gentle on your hair than a usual towel which leads to frizz. Untangle your hair using a wide toothed comb beginning at the ends of your hair and working your way up. The last bit is only important if you have long hair I believe.   Further tips:   You can do steps 1 to 4 the evening before you want to shower. That way your hair can absorb some of the oil and you might figure in the morning that you don't even have to shower yet. Gradually extend the time between your showers. After some month you shouldn't need to shower more than once a week. Be gentle with your hair if it is wet, since it's most prone to breakage at this point. Keep your brush clean. You can clean your brush by soaking the bristles in water with shampoo.   I hope that helps. If any of the steps is a unclear, feel free to ask."

NoPoo,3dlkih,PirateOwl,2,Fri Jul 17 18:01:16 2015 UTC,If it's your first wash it's going to take some time for your hair and scalp to revert to it's natural production of oils. You could look into slightly basic (or at least neutral) products that can help you raise your pH. Litmus paper is your friend for testing things and knowing where the water in your home stands isn't a bad choice either.
NoPoo,3djfee,PsycheTL,2,Thu Jul 16 19:27:14 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting hypothesis.. I can't weigh in much on that, but as someone who is also WO and over her transition, I do want to add that I've noticed that hot weather will make my scalp get a little more greasy temporarily. I don't use a BBB at all after my transition. I don't even use a comb.   Has your weather changed? Also, have you changed the temperature of your showers? I think warmer water is more effective at washing grease out of WO hair, so if you have been taking colder showers, it's possible that maybe your hair is a little greasier because more of the oil remained behind."
NoPoo,3dko8y,simplydivine,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:20:00 2015 UTC,"Your shampoo probably contains sulfate.  This ingredient strips the natural oils off as well as the extra oil or grease on your hair.  It takes away the moisture barrier of your hair temporarily too which can contribute to unmanageability.  Try finding a shampoo without any ingredient with sulfate in the name.  You might want to switch your conditioner too if you decide to change your shampoo.  In the new conditioner you get you should avoid ingredients ending in ""cone"" or ""one"" such as dimethicone and also avoid ones with paraben.  These both build up on the hair and need sulfate shampoo to remove."
NoPoo,3dko8y,TheShotgunBetty,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:16:35 2015 UTC,Do you have any suggestions for shampoo and conditioner ?
NoPoo,3dko8y,TheShotgunBetty,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:11:40 2015 UTC,"Shea Moisture is the brand I use and love, they have shampoo and conditioners tailored to each hair type and need so you can look and see which one matches yours the best!  Another good brand is Carol's Daughter."
NoPoo,3dkcjq,hcbradley1,2,Thu Jul 16 23:38:18 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you can go with the conditioner-method. First find a shampoo that does not contain any silicones, but have sodium sulfates as you need to clean out the silicone you have in your hair from other shampoos and hair products. Then you wash your hair with it twice to get rid off old silicones.  Now you use a conditioner that doesn't contain any silicone either, and wash your hair with it. Use a little at a time, massage it in to your scalp and in your hair, rinse well. And I mean really well... :) Now you stick with your conditioner when you want to wash your hair. Do not use any other shampoo after this, or this shampoo. Then you have to start over again...  Here is a good list of what to avoid in the list of ingredients in both shampoos and conditioners http://www.wikihow.com/Determine-if-a-Hair-Product-is-Curly-Girl-Approved  On the forum lockig.se (swedish) you can register and find a great list over conditioners that works to wash with. :) Hope you figure something out! Send me a PM if I can help."
NoPoo,3di1tt,fangus,4,Thu Jul 16 13:10:18 2015 UTC,I shampoo before I get a haircut. I do it out of courtesy for the hairdresser and because my hair will be back to the way it was in a week.

If I didn't tell her, she would have no idea I was no poo.  But if your hair is greasy, do whatever you need to do to ungrease it otherwise they may refuse service (rightfully imho)."
NoPoo,3di1tt,stopyellingimnotdone,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:28:23 2015 UTC,"I've been no or low poo for a few years now, and although I rarely get my hair cut in salon, when I do its never been a problem. If I feel like my hair is clean enough for my partner to run his fingers through, it's clean enough for a hairdresser. I've  had nothing but comments on how soft and healthy my hair was.   That said, there's a difference between clean but natural and greasy. Don't go to the salon greasy. But if you go to the salon with your hair anything other than how you usually wear it, you won't get the best haircut for your natural hair."
NoPoo,3df8v0,allycakes13,11,Wed Jul 15 20:24:33 2015 UTC,"The Lush bars have sodium lauryl sulfate in them! I remember getting myself one thinking that because they're natural that they'd be sulfate free, but nope :("

The greatest thing Lush has going for them is an incredible marketing program.  Their products are nowhere near as natural or high quality as you can find many other places for far less money.  Day 1 after using a shampoo bar, you should NOT have oily hair.  That's not transition at all.  Transition oil would come after a few days generally.    All that said, I'm hesitant to send you info on our products since I don't want this to be about me bashing another company to get you to buy mine, but if you're interested I'm happy to share it with you for your review.  Aside from that, find a better NoPoo or shampoo bar.  Just my $.02."

NoPoo,3df8v0,oasis948151,3,Thu Jul 16 12:16:55 2015 UTC,"We make/sell natural skin & hair care products including a nopoo that is a direct shampoo replacement.  There are a lot of people here who use it regularly.  We came up with our NoPoo after about 2 years of research on it. It is designed as a direct shampoo replacement and is dead simple to use. No measuring/mixing/etc, and no BS/ACV. Just use as you would shampoo. 100% natural, no sulfates, foaming ingredients, parabens, etc. And it is completely customizable for fragrance and of course pH balanced for your hair.  We have multiple blends for every hair type (normal, ethnic, itchy/flaky scalp & color treated hair). All of which will clean your hair without stripping it or leaving your hair greasy, sticky or feeling like straw.  When you use it, since there are no foaming agents, it will not foam (like most any other NoPoo). Just put a small amount in your palm, work it into your scalp thoroughly, then pull down into your hair. Let that sit for around 2 min (basically do your hair & leave it sit while you wash your body) and then rinse. No conditioner, detangler etc needed (though they can be used if you desire). And no need to repeat.  Here's the link with more information on the product:  http://skinchanted.com/collections/hair-care/products/peek-a-poo-natural-nopoo-shampoo-alternative  Of course we have a 100% satisfaction guarantee and we also just dropped the price by $2.  We also recently launched on Amazon too: http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dbeauty&field-keywords=skinchanted  If you have any questions about our stuff, I'm happy to answer them."

NoPoo,3deo2p,halbers18,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:02:21 2015 UTC,I would love to hear about this as well. The waxy buildup was why I stopped nopoo'ing after a month because it only got worse.
NoPoo,3dec7r,LikeCurry,3,Wed Jul 15 16:38:54 2015 UTC,"Well, if the ends are split, I would suggest getting a trim. For the dryness, lots of people put a little coconut oil (or other kind of oil) on dry ends. Just rub a little bit on your hands then spread it wherever your hair is dry. If that doesn't work, try using some sort of deep conditioner on the ends (or the lower half of your hair) when you shower. It is best to leave it on for a bit of time, so you could even put it on your ends, wait a bit, then shower to rinse it off. Try to do this once a week. Since you already CO-wash your hair, you are probably using conditioner that is silicone free (right?) so look for a deep conditioner that is also silicone free. Shea Moisture is a popular brand that has a lot of great deep conditioners (and CO-washs!)"
NoPoo,3dec7r,purple_cats,2,Wed Jul 15 17:20:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestions.  I put some coconut oil in last week and left it on for a while as I went about the house doing chores, then washed it out.  No noticeable difference, but if I keep it up I'll probably see a change in it.  I do use a deep conditioner probably once weekly, but I only wash my hair about twice a week, so I'll just remember I need to do it each time I wash."
NoPoo,3ddl1t,varialflop,4,Wed Jul 15 13:02:44 2015 UTC,Good luck with this!  May I suggest trying to give it more than one week!  After shampooing your hair so much your hair will probably go through a greasy transition period which can be miserable. But with dry shampoo/baby powder/etc you can stick through it.  I very recently also jumped on the bandwagon as well. The first week I needed to wear my hair up and now I'm on my third day after shampooing with Dr Bronners Shampoo bar and I'm able to wear my hair down no problem.  When before I could barely go 8 hours without my hair getting greasy and feeling the need to wash it.   Trust the process!
NoPoo,3ddl1t,halleyscomet1214,2,Wed Jul 15 13:13:51 2015 UTC,check our r/curlyhair too!
NoPoo,3ddl1t,featheredd,2,Wed Jul 15 17:34:34 2015 UTC,Some tips to reduce frizz with curly hair: untangle your hair in the shower when wet with conditioner using your fingers rather than brushing your hair. Apply leave in conditioner and products while your hair is still soaking wet. After the products are applied you can squeeze out extra moisture. Plop your hair for 10 minutes or more to soak up excess water. Then style your hair while you have some kind of oil or cream on your hands.     Definitely check out /r/curlyhair
NoPoo,3dcwj4,healive,5,Wed Jul 15 07:46:28 2015 UTC,"cutting out shampoo will make your hair healthier. I don't know about thicker, but when it is healthier, your are less likely to tear it out because of tangles. When you don't use shampoo, you won't need conditioner, so your haircare routine will not be as time consuming.   I guess you could use a straightener if you want your hair straight. I don't really style my hair so I don't know about that."

You might just still be in the adjustment period where your hair is still overcompensating for the natural oils being stripped from shampoo washes. Sometimes it take a while for it to completely even out, but it is so worth it!"
NoPoo,3d7m0q,halbers18,5,Tue Jul 14 03:35:33 2015 UTC,"I use an ACV wash every time I shower (which is only like once every 3 days), and I've found that as long as it's dilute, it's not a big deal. Keeps my hair soft and shiny, and my scalp super happy."
NoPoo,3d7m0q,merpsalot,2,Tue Jul 14 05:23:45 2015 UTC,"I'm a no-'poo newbie, so I'm not certain that vinegar doesn't have anything in it that'll mess up hair long-term (though I don't think so?), but I can speak confidently to pH balance stuff!  Hair and skin's ideal balance is around a 5.5 on the pH scale. ACV is usually in the high 2s/low 3s, which'll dry everything out, but if you dilute it with water (neutral pH of 7), it can bring the level right up! So as long as you do that, your hair/scalp should be quite happy with its pH levels.  (If you wanna be super certain you're diluting your ACV the right amount, I'd recommend purchasing some pH test strips. You can find decent ones for low prices on Amazon, and they come with charts and instructions and stuff, so they're easy as pie to use. Just dab on a drop of your mix, compare it to the chart, and it'll tell you if you're in a good pH range!)"
NoPoo,3d7ra4,dirtbooksun,3,Tue Jul 14 04:20:10 2015 UTC,"Awesome post! We make a NoPoo using soap nuts and it has gone over very well.   2 things to watch out for.   1- citric acid is not technically a preservative though it can act as a mold/bacteria inhibitor by altering the pH of the product.  Watch out with that, or try a different preservative.   2- depending on the fragrance you use, you may experience fermentation of the soap nuts liquid. If you do, the bottles can pressurize to the point of explosion. If you experience anything like that, consider adding some potassium sorbate.   Great to see another user of soap nuts. They are fantastic!"
NoPoo,3d7ra4,JeF4y,2,Tue Jul 14 17:44:55 2015 UTC,Thanks for that!!!  I forgot to say i also keep it in the fridge. I so far have used it all long before it went bad. The first batch i made with tea tree essential oil which i believe can also help prevent bacteria growing. Im not a big fan of the scent though so last time used a mandarin eo.
NoPoo,3d7uh9,penguinsk2,2,Tue Jul 14 04:50:55 2015 UTC,"You will probably find yourself needing to use baking soda at least once, since a lot of shampoos and conditioners have silicones in them that stay in your hair forever until they get purged with something super harsh, but you're on the right track wanting to avoid it as a regular part of your hair care routine!  I'd really recommend looking at the sidebar, it has a bunch of links including the specific names of hair product ingredients to avoid (such as those silicones) and how to get through the (inevitable, sorry) transition phase where your hair will be pumping out a bunch of excess sebum because it expects it to get stripped away any second.  In non-sidebar news, I went water-only entirely on the info provided by this blogger from her knowledge of natural hair care and her personal journey into water-only (I'd strongly recommend checking out the updates linked at the top of the post so you know what to expect! It isn't pretty, we must suffer for our ultimate convenience :P)"
NoPoo,3d7uh9,PsycheTL,2,Thu Jul 16 19:37:48 2015 UTC,"From the sidebar information:    Frizzy Hair You're probably using too much baking soda or clay, or leaving it in your hair too long. Try adding honey, or rubbing a little bit of moisturizing oil onto your hair (coconut, jojoba, sweet almond, extra virgin olive oil...).  Greasy Hair Some people experience an adjustment, or ""de-tox"" period of greasiness as they transition to no-poo. Do not over-wash, it will pass soon! If you've been using your routine faithfully and experience greasy hair, try using less ACV in your rinse, cut out honey if you've been using it, try switching to a citrus rinse, or use a comb instead of a brush to style your hair.  If you have greasy hair and need a quick fix on a day when you're not washing your hair, try applying a tiny bit of cornstarch to your scalp and combing through to the ends. Remember, greasy hair does not mean dirty hair, it probably doesn't need to be washed!  *CORN STARCH is the secret to keeping your hair from looking greasy at the roots. Apply in small amounts to your roots, and rub it in; keep adding the corn starch in small amounts until your hair looks good. Takes the grease right out!! Most baby powder is made with 100% corn starch, and sometime has lavender or other herbs added to it that can be quite soothing.  Dry hair If your hair is very dry, you may have used too much baking soda or clay and should lesson the amount. You may also need to use more ACV in your rinse.  Try smoothing a tiny bit of oil into your hair either after you shower, or in the morning. A tiny bit is all you need. Coconut oil works well, and smells great! If you find your hair is chronically dry, and you like the idea of a hot oil treatment every so often, you can follow one of these recipes, the latter is best for dry hair and the former is a hot oil treatment for occasional use :  -- 1 teaspoon soybean oil  -- 2 teaspoons castor oil  Combine ingredients then warm on low heat. Massage mixture into the scalp and hair. Wrap hair in a hot towel for 15 minutes. Shampoo & rinse out.  -- 1/2 cup of dried rosemary leaves  -- 1/2 cup olive oil  Combine ingredients then heat up until warm. Strain. Coat the entire scalp and ends of hair with the oil mixture. Wrap hair in saran wrap and a towel over that, leave on for 15 minutes. Wash hair twice to remove the oil. Use this treatment twice a month or when your needs a deep conditioning. Leaves your hair shiny and rehydrated.  If you want, or need the occasional deep condition, especially if you have very long hair with breakage at the ends, you can try a mix with one small jar of real mayonnaise and 1/2 of an avocado. Mash them together in a bowl with your hands until it's a minty green colour, then smooth onto your hair. Put on a shower cap, or wrap your hair in saran wrap and leave on for 20 minutes before thoroughly rinsing clean. If you're using this only for the tips of your hair, or for very short hair, half the ingredients.  If you regularly blow-dry, stop! Scrunch with a towel and then let your hair air-dry. Curling, straightening or kinking your hair using hot irons can also attribute to drying and breakage. You can also try using a boar-bristle brush to brush your hair with, this will distribute your hair's natural oils evenly. Though be warned that you don't need to use it all the time, and using it too much might actually make your hair feel more oily then usual!"

NoPoo,3cyztp,KingWarriorForever96,6,Sun Jul 12 01:45:03 2015 UTC,"No poo is definitely possible if you work-out regularly.  Sweat can easily be rinsed out with water and gently scrubbing your scalp with your fingertips.  This works best if you wash immediately following your workout so that no bacteria can build-up and cause a smell.  If you do find that your hair is smelling sweaty or musty, you can try washing every 4-7 days with a shampoo bar, rye flour, a honey wash, or any other washing method recommended on this sub.  Swimming in a chlorinated pool requires a little more maintenance.  Make sure you wet your hair before getting in the pool.  Wear a swim cap to help protect your hair.  Rinse your hair in the shower as soon as you get out of the pool.  If you find that your hair still smells of chlorine, or that the chlorine is causing your hair to be dry or damaged, you can use vitamin C to neutralize the chlorine.  Simply crush a vitamin C tablet or use 1/2 tsp vitamin C crystals (both available at any stores that sell vitamins) and dissolve in 1 cup of warm water.  Use a pop-top water bottle to apply the solution to your entire hair, working it down to the roots.  Scrub the mixture in as your would shampoo and then let it sit for a few minutes.  Rise well in the shower.  If your hair still seems a bit dry, you can co-wash (conditioner-only wash) with a silicone-free conditioner once a week.  Or you can make a natural hair mask with avocado or banana (instructions available online)."
NoPoo,3cyztp,ammolite,2,Sun Jul 12 03:27:05 2015 UTC,"This comment is chick full of great advice!   Vitamin C works wonders to neutralize chlorine on skin, too. I used to try to rinse the chlorine out of my skin immediately after swimming, but I would still smell like chlorine for the rest of the day. Then I started bringing a solution of vitamin C in water to my gym, and spraying it all over in the shower after I was done swimming. No more chlorine smell.   You will see a lot of recommendations for using baking soda (abbreviated into BS) or apple cider vinegar (abbreviated into ACV). I  would NOT recommend using Baking soda because it can damage your hair. Apple Cider Vinegar should be fine, though. I actually did Baking Soda for about a year before I started looking into why it was bad, and I stopped. I now do ""water only"" (abbreviated WO) and it works out fine for me, but WO is sometimes considered the hardest way to do NoPoo.  I would start off by doing your research into some of the methods mentioned in the above comment - shampoo bar, rye flour, etc. Do your research, because there are some things you should know. (Like that rye flour works great, but certain kinds of rye flour can be harder to rinse out completely and leave you with some white flakes in your hair - but there are ways around that.) You should also know that sometimes there is a transition period where your hair may become temporarily greasier due to you not using regular shampoo anymore. This differs for different people, and can last from days to months. Wether your tap water is hard or soft also will affect your routine."
NoPoo,3cz578,bobvo1996,4,Sun Jul 12 02:38:10 2015 UTC,"If you're not using shampoo, you need to make sure everything you do put into your hair is water-soluble. That means avoiding any kind of hair product that contains silicones -- any ingredient that ends in -cone, -conol, or -xane. You can make exceptions for ones that begin with PEG- or PPG-, as I understand it -- those have been modified somehow to make them water-soluble (not sure of the specifics, I'm not a chemist).  There are shampoos out there that have no sulfates, too, which will clean your hair without doing the damage sulfates do. They can't remove silicones but I always feel more sure my hair is product-free after using them. I favor Kinky Curly Come Clean.  I'm also a fan of dunking my hair in water with enough sea salt in it to make it taste a bit salty, at least in the summer. My hair loves that shit, and it feels a lot cleaner afterwards, too."

I have noticed my hair only seems to respond well to it in high-dewpoint weather, but in that weather it does respond beautifully -- perhaps the combination of forgiving weather and the various and sundry trace minerals found in sea salt make up for the sulfate content."

NoPoo,3co699,charliecfoxtrot,4,Thu Jul 9 12:50:36 2015 UTC,"I support your decision to avoid baking soda. I used it initially when I went nopoo, before I found out that a lot of people actually think that the pH levels cause damage to your hair. You can find out more here. I'm not too worried about baking soda clogging your drain, or ACV stinking up the bathroom, but I am concerned about baking soda ruining your hair. Please consider looking into this matter before you try using baking soda.   I eventually went water only. I now use nothing except water to clean my hair, and very occasionally, a boar bristle brush (which you'll often see abbreviated as BBB). BBBs are often recommended for no pooers, even those who use BS, because they help move scalp oils to the ends of your hair which can help to protect and moisturize the ends. It also helps decrease oil buildup on your scalp, which is something that often happens temporarily while people transition from regular shampoo to, say, water only or something.  If you want to start using a different type of shampoo, I think, but I am not sure - so please check - that Suave carries shampoos that are sulfate free. I'd also recommend searching for ""sulfate free shampoo"" in this subreddit. Have you considered washing your hair less often and seeing what happens? You could probably get away with using shampoo once every few days to decrease the frequency of your removing oils from your hair.   I'd definitely avoid heat. I've also read - but I would recommend you look into this on your own - about some people using cotton t-shirts instead of towels to dry their hair. It's said that this method cuts down on frizz, which should increase shine, by helping the 'scales' on follicles lie down as the hair dries. May be something you want to look into."

Try water-washing tomorrow to see if you can get rid of any build-up.  I've found that ACV takes longer to rinse out after using soap (ex: a shampoo bar) than it does after using baking soda.  There's also the chance that something in your shampoo bar plus the ACV either dried-out or otherwise irritated your scalp.  I'm not sure what that mixture could be as everyone's skin has different sensitivities, but perhaps you should look into using a different acidic rinse (ex: diluted lemon juice or citric acid powder) or a different type of conditioner altogether (ex: banana and avocado mask, silicone-free conditioner, coconut milk, herbal tea)."

NoPoo,3c8tza,Fisk19,4,Sun Jul 5 23:53:10 2015 UTC,Dr. Bronner's is very alkaline while hair is naturally acidic.  It's going to react similarly like baking soda on the hair.  Some people have luck but over time it will still cause damage to the hair due to such differences in pH.  There's nothing moisturizing or nourshing about it for hair.  It's fairly harsh to be using in hair because of the delicate balance needed to keep hair healthy.  Some people already have healthy hair so it doesn't make as much of a difference at first.  Same goes for baking soda.
NoPoo,3c8tza,eraser-dust,2,Mon Jul 6 07:21:25 2015 UTC,"I have short hair, ranging from anywhere from five inches to under a quarter inch depending on my haircut so I don't know if this will help you or not. I bought two of these about a year ago and use about two teaspoons once a week. I still have the last of the second bottle, about four weeks to go until I run out. I started by using ACV and Baking soda but quickly realized that simply using Dr. Bronners seemed to do the same thing for me. It stripped the excess oils from my hair but left some and did not dry my hair or scalp. I no longer have occasional dandruff and my hair settled into a wave/curl. I have used regular shampoo once by accident during the past year and it left my hair brittle, dry, and sad looking. I do not dilute at all and I use a comb to help rinse the Dr. Bronners out of my hair so that leaves my hair untangled. I also do not dry my hair at all, I just squeeze the water out of it and muss it up and it curls as it air-dries. I will now forever use Dr. Bronners instead of commercial shampoos until the time that I nut up and go completely soap and shampoo free. I hope that this gives you some kind of help or encouragement, please PM if you have more questions. (Also, now that I think about it my adult acne pretty much went away too!)"
NoPoo,3c8tza,theoutrider5485,2,Mon Jul 6 01:55:49 2015 UTC,"I use Dr. Bronners bar soap, not liquid soap, so I don't have to worry about diluting it or anything. I do it about once a week, and it does a nice job of getting my hair clean without totally striping the oils.   It took some practice to be able to get a good lather that would get through to my scalp, but once I got it right I've been happy with the results. It might be better for greasy hair than dry hair though, mine tends to be pretty oily.  For the tangling, I follow up with an ACV rinse and that seems to help it smooth out and end up silky."
NoPoo,3c8tza,penopopolis,2,Mon Jul 6 13:02:38 2015 UTC,"I've been using Dr. Bronner's for about 10 months now (after 3 months of BS/ACV), and it definitely takes a little bit of trial-and-error.  I currently use 2.5 cups of water, .5 cups of soap, and 1 tsp jojoba oil.  One thing I find is that you need to use enough soap to get your whole head nice and sudsy.  I know a lot of people recommend using it ""sparingly,"" but I actually had more problems with build-up and coarse hair when I tried to use as little as possible. More suds is best! Also, you need to rise the soap mixture out before the suds disappears.  (Rinsing after the suds begins to dissipate tends to mean that the soap is bonding with the minerals in your tap water, causing build-up in your hair.)  I also find that using an ACV rinse (1 tbsp ACV to 1 cup water) after washing and rinsing is essential as a conditioner.  The ACV mixture needs to completely drench your hair (once again I know that people recommend using ACV ""sparingly,"" but more is best). It also needs to sit in your hair for a few minutes before being rinsed out in order to both condition and to help remove any build-up from the soap/hard water.  I have thick, straight, greasy hair and have found that liquid castile soap + ACV conditioner has been great for my hair and scalp.  (I know I'll get downvoted for saying this, but I have had a lot of success.)  My hair has been softer and more manageable than using shampoo, and my scalp has been less dry than using BS/ACV.  I only wash my hair every 4-5 days, and water-only wash every other day in between (every day if I'm particularly sweaty).  However, this is only what works for me.  No-poo is a personal experience since everyone's hair and body vary.  What works well for one person may be terrible for another.  You tried castile soap, and it didn't work for you.  There are plenty of other options out there!"

I used Herbal Essences Hello Hydration Conditioner, my homemade Shea Butter Mix as a leave in and water and Lush's R'n'B to refresh. I kept this up for about eight months, during which I chopped off all the damaged ends.  Then my hair started reacting badly to R'n'B. It became both extremely dry and extremely greasy so I had to drop it. Then I started experimenting with Deep Conditioners - Avocado and Yoghurt, Mayonnaise, Eggs. I used them once every couple months for about a year. Even now, every couple of months, I'll plop some mix of these ingredients into my hair.   Through the years I've used baking soda rinses (too drying), ACV rinses (love them), Aloe Vera Juice, Aztec Clay (a bitch to rinse out), Lush's Blousey (awesome but expensive), Dr Bronners (prefer it as a clarifier), Lush's Jungle (amazing but doesn't last long), Boots' Naked Rescue conditioners (love them), egg yolks (twice a year), honey (if I'm feeling fancy).  This sums up my routine over the past three years. Every now and then I do WO and I have experimented and used other products here and there but these four steps have been constant:   ACV rinse (with or without Aloe Vera) once - twice a week Co wash Hello Hydration or Naked Rescue as often as I feel Deep conditioning once a month to once every two months My Shea Butter Mix as a leave in"
NoPoo,3c8vfk,recoveringdeleted,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:55:50 2015 UTC,"Sorry your mom is like that but I've found dealing with parents who are less than stellar can equip you with coping tools for dealing with difficult people that many people lack.  I'm a guy so I don't really ever talk to anyone about how I do my hair, I mean if you were changing to a different scent shampoo or got dandruff and were trying some head and shoulders you wouldn't mention it to anyone would you?  I think novel ideas that are beneficial and go outside what society considers the norm are very easy to get excited about and that can make you want to talk with other people about it.  If it was brought up in conversation then I wouldn't be ashamed or hesitant to mention it in anyway it's just that things like that are normally done in a certain way and most people that I encounter at least never really talk about how they wash their hair.  If you think about it from the other person's perspective then you're bringing up a topic which is not normally a conversational piece, which puts people thinking it's slightly out of the norm already, and then you explain how you do that thing that other people don't talk about differently from other people.  To yourself you're telling them about this exciting new thing in your life that is working for you but to them you're simply expressing how you differ from most people.  People want to be around others who are like them so bringing up odd topics of conversation and then expressing how you're outside the norm wont normally benefit you in any way unless you manage to find someone that is also outside the norm in their own way and you connect with them, or you are able to convince the person you're talking with to try this new variance and then you connect with them over that."

We tend to forget the perspectives others may have when we feel ours is ""the norm"" or simply fantastic. I have always considered myself a bit of an oddball (as in I enjoy trying different methods for mundane everyday tasks, which others may not quite understand... just spicing things up a little) to begin with so maybe that is why it seems such a ""normal"" subject to talk about for me. (Thank goodness for this sub haha).  In saying that I have to admit that I am excited because I really do feel it is beneficial. For me it has worked wonders and because of that I want to share it with others who may never have heard of the idea of going shampoo free. Someone's got to be an advocate for it, right? I don't mind much what the people around me think. Friends, strangers, colleagues etc. but boy does my mother knows how to grind my gears. The day I originally wrote this post, she had managed to push me over the edge. Needless to say, I learned my lesson, and plan on simply not mentioning it to her again. If she starts to talk about hair I plan to change the subject. I don't like to waste energy getting upset over the little things that mean nothing in the big picture.

It's kind of the reason I switched to WO/nopoo in the first place, I figured what I'm doing is going to catch up with my hair in the long run, even though it's fine right now.  At the very least I might check out r/coldshowers, and want to go back to nopoo, maybe doing nopoo or incorporating essential oils that are good for itchy scalp."

A better solution is to spritz it with water and apply conditioner BEFORE swimming. Then after swimming apply conditioner and leave it on for a while before rinsing it out. Maybe even leave it in for a day or so, depending on the type of conditioner. Then apply oil.

It's been about a month for me, I use bs&acv about once or twice a week, and sulfide free shampoo and conditioner about once every two weeks or before a big event. I don't even rinse with water most days.   I used to be like you, instant grease before the end of the day. The initial greasy period is the toughest part and you've just got to power through it. I make up for it by during that transitional period wearing my hair up and with a headband over my scalp line to hide the greasiest part.   Also, dry shampoo helps, but with our straight hair won't eliminate the greasy look;  it'll help, and will reduce hair clumping I tend to get when my hair is greasy, but really isn't as clean looking as freshly washed hair."
NoPoo,3bqxnx,YeastInVagMakesBread,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:20:18 2015 UTC,How long would you say your transition period was? Seems like you totally get what I'm going through! Did you start right away waiting a week between washes? Or did you work up to it?
NoPoo,3bqxnx,YeastInVagMakesBread,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:51:23 2015 UTC,"My transitional greasy period was a couple of weeks, two or three. Couldn't even tell when I had my hair in a bun with a headband.   I think the one thing that helped me the most was I'd been using sulfate-free shampoo for several months before I tried going no-poo. It made a huge difference immediately when your hair isn't getting as fried with sulfates.   What I started off with was every other day washing with the SF shampoo, the off days with dry shampoo spray but I'm not a fan of the build-up it gives. Then I started rinsing between washes, that helped, and I was able to extend the time between my washes.   I just washed and conditioned my hair tonight since I have an event this weekend. Otherwise, I'll use bs & acv on Sundays and not wash or just rinse with water the rest of the week. If I were ever wearing my hair down I'd spritz with dry shampoo and ignore the self conscious feeling of knowing it's unwashed but the incredible volume it gets totally makes up for it."

NoPoo,3bqxnx,TheShotgunBetty,2,Wed Jul 1 14:12:24 2015 UTC,"100% do not use baking soda on your hair or scalp ever.  It is very drying and stripping on he scalp which will actually cause your scalp to product more oil.  Sodium bicarbonate also denatures the proteins of your hair. Your hair is composed almost entirely of amino acid chains (proteins) and baking soda comes in and breaks those chains. The broken chains feel slippery to the touch so many get the impression their hair is getting ""soft"" so people continue using it until severe hair or skin damage occurs. Just simply do not ever use baking soda. An alternative is rye flour, it has a neutral pH and won't destroy your skin or hair.    The best thing for me was to just resign to greasy smelly hair for the first week, to get the message across to my hair and scalp ""No I am not going to wash you every day anymore!"" I used a combo of unsweetened cocoa powder (as dry shampoo, I have brown hair but yucca root powder can be used instead for light hair colors) and did a lot of  braids and buns to ""hide"" the grease.  At the end of the week I washed my hair with a no poo safe shampoo (Shea Moisture Curl and Shine shampoo) and started my no poo journey.  Now I alternate between acv vinegar rinse, dry shampoo, and my curl and shine shampoo.    I found my hair was like a spoiled child.  It threw a tantrum at first when I stopped washing every day, and decided to get back at me by getting very oily and having a strong sebum smell-the tricks my hair had used in the past to trick me into sudsing.  However I ignored it and just let it rebel, and by the end of the week it realized it wasn't getting its way and that it should just produce a normal amount of oil because it wasn't going anywhere.  I couldn't have survived that period without dry shampoo so def look into it!"

I did get severe dandruff and a LOT of breakage from this so I think I might be leaving WO and going to low poo instead.

I've never gotten compliments on my hair before and now people are telling me a few times a day that my hair has gotten so long and full.

NoPoo,3bnbv3,Kpoppin,2,Thu Jul 2 14:00:54 2015 UTC,"Our stories are nearly identical. I threw in the towel a few weeks ago and went back to the shampoo I used prior to switching. Then I remembered why I wanted to try no-poo in the first place.  I've never been so down-in-the-dumps about my hair in my entire life :( There were about 3 days in the last 7 months (doing no-poo) where I had my hair down and wasn't completely self-conscious about it. Just like you I tried honey, egg, ACV, dry shampoo, cornstarch, cocoa powder, argan oil, coconut oil, and even five hundred flavors of shampoo bars. None agreed with my hair. BBB didn't make a difference, and on the really bad days when I would use it it would get so junked up with sebum so fast that it actually made my roots look WORSE. I have THREE BBB's now because I had to rotate them so much because I always was cleaning them. Next on my list to try was a shower filter just in case it was the hard water making my hair so disgusting, but then I thought how much more heartbreak can I take? How many more products can I buy and then stop using because they're not making a difference?  So I switched back to regular shampoo - about two weeks now. I've since re-learned that the clean feeling only lasts for two days or so, and that it makes my hair prone to tangles. Reasons why I was looking for an alternative method in the first place. I can't win.  So now I guess I'm going to do like you and look for a low-poo method. I'm just dreading how many more products I have to go through before I find one that gives my hair even the semblance of being clean."

If I wash my hair but don't do a good enough job of it, it winds up feeling and looking more horrid than it did before I started.  It took a few tries to get the hang of but, with a bit of elbow grease, a paste of rye flour and water gets my hair really clean (barring a few residual flakes of rye that brush out easily afterwards) and looking better than my usual shampoo. It's not for everyone but worth considering."
NoPoo,3bnbv3,Kpoppin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:02:46 2015 UTC,Rye flour? I can't say I've ever actually heard of that method. Huh. So it kind of actually scrubs the hair clean?

Maybe being low-poo will bring me back in to the no-poo groove, but I'm happy to be dealing with my messy, tangly, unmanageable hair once more as that's how my hair's always been. It's only been two days since washing and I already see a noticeable decline in the post-shampoo state - though not to the point where I feel I need to wash it just yet.   I think I'll coast on my new found shampoo clean for a few weeks before deciding whether I want to attempt to try out a proper introduction into no-poo...

NoPoo,3bo8m2,ema1237,2,Tue Jun 30 21:36:35 2015 UTC,"Some of that depends on your hair type, length, and the end result you are trying to achieve.  Generally apple cider vinegar with the mother is gently cleansing and conditioning and works great as an introductory no poo method.  Your hair will probably still be transitioning, and you will build up a bulk of oil or waxy sebum.  This can be removed with finely milled rye flour mixed together with water to form a paste.  Do the rye flour once in a while during your transition to get rid of buildup.  It takes a while to rinse completely out but it worth it to get rid of the build up.  Get back to me about your goals, hair type, etc and I can help you out with a more specific routine or methods!"

NoPoo,3bo8m2,TheShotgunBetty,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:50:54 2015 UTC,"It depends.  Are you a DIY type person?  Like making your own stuff, mixing/measuring?  Or do you just like to grab & go.  If it's the latter of the two, this will be your easiest way to transition into NoPoo.  It is literally a direct shampoo replacement.  Use it exactly as you would your old shampoo.  Daily is fine, as is once or twice a month, etc.  There's just no real thinking that's needed when using our NoPoo.  Just use & enjoy."
NoPoo,3bo8m2,JeF4y,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:02:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Really, my major question is: will Peekapoo yield the same results as the traditional nopoo method?"
NoPoo,3bo8m2,TheShotgunBetty,2,Tue Jun 30 21:46:01 2015 UTC,"There are so many varied methods that they each tend to focus on one thing or another.  Some focus on cleaning, some conditioning, some for lightening hair, some for dandruff or psoriasis.  Its basically just like thee products you see in the shampoo aisle at the department store.  No poo is really about finding what works for your hair individually.  If something has safe ingredients, and is making your hair better or closer to your desired goal keep doing it!  Most of us here at no poo spend our first six months mixing and matching methods and ingredients in trial and error.    As long as you are using no poo safe ingredients, your hair will thank you tremendously,  and should give you the results of no poo."
NoPoo,3bo8m2,JeF4y,2,Wed Jul 1 20:52:29 2015 UTC,thank you!
NoPoo,3bo8m2,JeF4y,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:29:41 2015 UTC,"Of course I'm going to say positive things because we make this, but I'm sure others will chime in.  First, what is ""traditional NoPoo method""?  There isn't one.  People use anything from water only, to BS/ACV, to eggs & beer, to honey, etc etc etc.  The whole point and theory behind ""NoPoo"" is to cleanse your hair without harsh chemicals and without stripping your hair & scalp of its natural sebum.  However you achieve that result is ""NoPoo"".  Whether it yields the same result as BS/ACV is really up to the individual.  We get a lot of clients who had problems with or got tired of BS/ACV.  Does that mean this is better than BS/ACV?  Not necessarily.  It is just different from BS/ACV.    Everything in our NoPoo is 100% natural (with the exception of fragrance oils added at our customer's discretion), and we avoid items that are going to strip your hair & scalp.  It's a pretty simple product, and after it being our best seller for nearly 2 years with only 3 bottles returned, I think it's pretty effective, and put my money behind it when I guarantee you'll think so too. =)"
NoPoo,3bo8m2,JeF4y,2,Wed Jul 1 12:59:38 2015 UTC,"So, if I were to use it, would I go through the same 'oily phase' that people using the BS/ACV methods endure?"
NoPoo,3bo8m2,JeF4y,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:55:37 2015 UTC,"Good question!  The answer though is not perfectly straight forward.  It's more of a ""sometimes"".    We've been shocked with the amount of people who have zero 'oily' transition.  It happens more often than not.  However, some people still go through that oily phase until they find the balance on wash cycles and distributing sebum using a good boar-bristle brush.  In short, everyone and every head is different.  If you jump in and go from daily washing with shampoo to weekly washing with Peek-A-Poo (or BS/ACV), rest assured, you're going to have an oily experience.  However, if you simply replace your existing shampoo with our NoPoo and slowly ween down you will do much better.  We tell people that if you're using shampoo daily, use our NoPoo daily for at least a week, and then start dropping days until you find your happy balance.    Hope that makes sense."

NoPoo,3blgup,madnessfalls,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:34:10 2015 UTC,"If you are willing to do shampoo bars Chagrin Valley has a butter bar which is supposed to be shampoo/conditioner in one.  You will need to do ACV rinses to get off hard water residue after rinsing,  and you need to rinse a good few minutes after all later is out of your hair.  They also have recommendations for dry/damaged hair.  All of their stuff is made from natural substances except Lye for the soapanification process which does not remain in the end product.   And no, I don't know them or work for them.   Just a new customer for life after I tried some of their samples (coconut oil shampoo bar,  extra honey beer shampoo bar so far.. also tried soap nuts which didn't like on my dry hair). I tried nopoo but couldn't keep it up because we also have very hard water,  and not willing to damage my hair with baking soda could not get residue off my scalp, so ended up with great hair until..m scalp zits, then started losing hair due to clogged pores.  So then tried Liggets which I liked.. but wanted some more options which is how I found them...  They have recommendations by hair type, but before ordering full bars you can order samples.   Shipping is quite reasonable and the samples last a while (soap nuts sample  lasted me over 12 washings before I gave up on it and tried the others).  Here are there recommendations for dry hair... although they recommend starting off with something simple like the coconut milk bar.  My scalp zits are now gone, and residue with ACV WITH A LOT of washing.  http://www.chagrinvalleysoapandsalve.com/helpchoose/choose-shampoo/dry-hair/"
NoPoo,3bkj5o,forkingfork123,2,Mon Jun 29 23:42:45 2015 UTC,"The trick is to ween your scap from using products.  After sometime it'll stop working on over drive and your oil production will subside and balance out.  I have thick hair as well, and when I begun, my hair was long enough to put into a ponytail.  First, start decreasing the amount of times you wash your hair in a week.  You're basically starving it of your natural oils it needs to be healthy; so your scalp is in overdrive to counteract the lack of oil.  After a while of doing that, stop using shampoo.  There is enough soap in conditioner to get your hair clean.  I'll note that at this stage, however, that I started to have a little bit of dandruff and my scalp itched a little.  Don't worry about it, and continue.  And finally after just using conditioner for about a month or so.  Stop using the conditioner.  And while you are bathing, just give you head a good rub and scratch for a good minute.  And there you have it, NoPoo.  It is a special note that with each step in the process, your head and scalp are going to take a few weeks to a month to fully recalibrate to the current regimen you are using at the time.  Oh yeah, btw, the shampoo and conditioner I had used was just regular Dove.  I now only ""wash"" my hair with water twice a week."
NoPoo,3bkj5o,Sylxian,2,Tue Jun 30 16:03:00 2015 UTC,"Isnt conditioner the same as shampoo kind of?  So, at the moment. I'm washing with water every 2nd day.  Is that good enough? No shampoo or conditioner."
NoPoo,3bkj5o,Sylxian,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:14:21 2015 UTC,"They are not really the same.  Sure some of them contain some of the same compounds.  The main difference, though, is the soap to other additives ratio.  Shampoo has a high soap ratio, whereas, conditioner has a lower soap ratio.  That's just fine.  Practically what I'm doing.  If you just started doing that, then it'll be about a month before your scalp reconfigures its oil output."
NoPoo,3bkj5o,Sylxian,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:10:01 2015 UTC,"Also, on water temperature.  If you've ever seen hair under a microscope, you'd know that it kinda looks like its made up of scales.    Well, hot water essentially spreads the scales out making the individual hairs have more friction; so they are more prone to feel not move and makes your hair a little more frizzy.  Cold water, on the other hand, causes the scales to seal together pretty tightly making for a very smooth surface, and allows the hair to move a lot more.  I'll typically hit my hair was some luke warm or cool temperature water to seal my hair back up after my usual very hot showers/baths.  To me in makes a difference."

I also have oily hair but I have not seen any changes making the switch. I usually wash on the 3rd day (in the morning), which is no different to my original routine with shampoo. I believe some people wash everyday.     Also, I think that when you do your final rinse, you should use cold water but warm during the rest should be fine. Although some will say to make it as cold as you can stand it throughout the whole process. I'm not sure of the science regarding this."

Now they're so strong and grow so long. It helps hair and skin too but I haven't really noticed a difference there. I started taking 1000 mcg and moving up every two or so weeks until I reached 5000. I've read that you need to drink between 3 to 5 liters of water a day if you do take the supplement because it can cause breakouts and makes your body produce more oil. I drink at least 3 but usually can't make it to more than 4 but I haven't had issues with breakouts. Anyway, that's my experience.

Apple cider vinegar is a gift from the anti dandruff gods.  To make a dandruff treatment, mix two parts acv with one part water.  Pour over just your scalp, not on the whole length of your hair.  Leave 5 mins and rinse fully.  Be warned, the next day you will need to exfoliate your scalp to get the old flakes off.  The vinegar will help the old flakes and dandruff affected cells to slough off.  You just need to gently scratch your head until you have manually removed the flakes and powder.  If you need to hop in the shower again after doing this, go ahead.  Do another vinegar rinse and you should notice fewer flakes.  Once you get to a point where the dandruff flare you are having fades and balances out, you can switch to a one part vinegar one part water rinse that you can also use on the length of your hair as well as scalp."

But I don't know if this is because my hair is less ""smooth"" now and it is tearing off. When I used Head and Shoulders it was shampoo and conditioner. This new stuff doesn't leave my hair feeling silky like Head and Shoulders did, which made the brush slide right through it. I can't tell if the brush is just tearing the hair, but I definitely end up with a lot of it."

Dandruff is caused by fungi and can cause hair loss.  Check out ones with ingredients TO Combat Dandruff.   Like tea tree oil.  Liggetts makes a tea trea oil and hemp I love and Chagrin Valley makes many, many which are supposed to be good for dandruff. as well as a butter bar conditioner and some leave in conditioners. I haven't tried any geared towards dandruff  but their coconut milk one is amazing (won't help with dandruff though)  Still shampoo but less harmful to your body and hair.   Do NOT lose your hair over this.  If you have bad dandruff try natural more gentle options but keep washing until dandruff decreases.   Also watch out for products marketed as nopoo they are just remarketing. Wen is actually currently being sued! !!  With SHampoo, you will need to rinse your hair a LONG t me t get all sticky residue out and acv rinses can help with transition but you won't need them forever. Just my suggestions.   Good luck!"

NoPoo,3b7btc,MalavethMorningrise,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:28:44 2015 UTC,I had great results from ACV wash for various skin problems including dandruff. Mix 8 parts of water with 2 parts of ACV. Rinse and massage the whole scalp hard.   Vinegar is still very mild for our skin and hair. Just ignore the baking soda part.   H&S is heavy on zinc. Might not hurt to take some zinc tablets.

I add 2 cups distilled water, about 4 tablespoons of unfiltered apple cider vinegar and about 10 drops of tea tree essential oil and put that in a spray bottle and spray it in my hair and on my scalp and leave it a few minutes before I rinse it out. To make it fancy I usually boil the distilled water with dried rosemary, lavender and nettle. The vinegar does a few things it helps get rid of dandruff and it will also make your hair smoother. The tea tree is for dandruff control. After I henna my hair I always use a trader joes brand conditioner without silicone (one of their two brands has it) I think their conditioner I use is rosemary and tea tree also."

I use it every 2 or 3 days."
NoPoo,3b7btc,MagickSkoolieBus,2,Sat Jun 27 16:33:41 2015 UTC,"Yep, Dharma would be the dandruff blend, and Greystone is the fragrance.  So there's a couple of things you can try.  One is that if your hair/scalp is better right after you wash it, try washing daily for a bit to see how your scalp reacts.  Then back down to skipping every 3rd day, and so on as your hair adjusts.  The alternate (and probably the best course) would be to see a dermatologist and have them diagnose what is going on with your scalp.  What you're experiencing is not normal, and may very well be some form of dermatitis on your scalp.    In any event, I'd definitely try to find a solution vice waiting and hoping it will get better.  It doesn't sound like this is anything that would be experienced during the normal transition phase."
NoPoo,3b7btc,dirtbooksun,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:49:27 2015 UTC,"I do think you should see a dermatologist too.  Really.  That said, while waiting...  Dandruff is generally believed to be a skin build up but is strongly believed  caused by a fungus as well in some cases.  Thanks to the skinceuticals rep who responded.  Ingredients appear as natural as possible (with one exception which is to be expected and not harmful) and might be great for scalp and itch. .However, even thoufh there is Neem in one of rhe products... I do not see a log of ingredients known to be antifungal or antifungal.  Even with some, eaxh case is different, and like antibiotics might be resistant to some compounds that work well for some, but not other strains.   If you like the products fine, but you may need to do something else to get it under control first (while waiting t see a dermatologist) then go back to them.  Here is my advice:  First, re possible clogged pores potentially causing hair loss: Products without the harsh chemicals do not strip as much crap from scalp. Regardless of possible Fungal infection:  dandruff may not be getting exfoliated enough and skin and  sebum may be clogging your pores.   There are dermatologists who think completely no poo can worsen conditions like dandruff and lead to hair loss.  I can do some digging to find actual studies-referenced on several beauty sites and news stories.  Here is a blog discussing it  http://geniusbeauty.com/cosmetics/no-poo-may-lead-hair-loss/  I DON'T think this is common as sometimes nopoo helps dandruff (probably those where it is caused by irritation and/or dry scalp) but believe happens to those who may have mild fungal infections which cause the dandruff and /or overproduction of skin and sebum clogging  pores  Skinchanted products appear to clean and might be great for the hair , and don't appear to have harmful chemicals, but dont see MANY ingredients with ingredients well known to fight fungal infections, except Neem. Like Bacteria Some infections will respond to differently to different things.  It contains potassium Sorbate which is an artificial chemical. but most products that clean will have to use something Sorbate is almost always produced chemically, but it has same structure as the naturally occurring substances. And any shampoo bar will have used Lye on the process of the ""soapanification"" process (none remains). Generally used as a preservative and may prevent some bacterial and mold growth.  http://m.md-health.com/Potassium-Sorbate.html. Basically it is probably your scalp and not the product.. but the product does not appear to be geared to deal with most scalp infections  To CONSIDER is if you have hard water. ..  Basically, it makes it near impossible to rinse everything and residue out of your hair and off scalp with hard water. Residue might not be getting rinsed out  no matter how long you rinse with regular washing.  And that means all the gunk you are trying to wash out stays in there too.  This was my problem when I was trying water only.  I got scalp zits and my scalp itched, even with acv rinses.  Why I went to shampoo bars.   What you can do about the hard water if it is contributing: -scritch a lot to loosen up all crap on your scalp.  Daily, and and a LOTbefore washing.  Basically massage and scratching without nails.  -scritch vigorously  when using product on the shower and while rinsing to get all the crap off.  Rinse, rinse, rinse, rinse.  Several minutes and vigorously after all product is out of your hair.   -use a DILUTED vinegar rinse.  Apply DIRECTLY to your scalp with a bottle like a mustard squeeze bottle and scritch.  Leave in for several minutes before rinsing.  Some people have sensitivity to Acv SO you could try rice vinegar if you are.  Also What Id recommend: While waiting for the dermatologist.. temporarily switch to a product that has other elements that are known to fight dandruff and hair loss like tea tree oil. You can go back to the products you like after your issues have cleared up. Tea tree oil has been proven to treat fungal infections http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/113.html J Liggetts has tea tree  https://jrliggett.com/tea-tree-hemp-oil-shampoo-bar.html   Chagrin Valley: I've ordered from these guys, but not tried them for hair loss, but what I've tried  does help itching and dry scalp.  They do have some with tea tree... also formulations that work towards dandruff and some for hair loss.  I'd check out the hair loss recommendations first.   You can order SAMPLES from them which last for quite a few washings (for me up to 15 so far!):  http://www.chagrinvalleysoapandsalve.com/helpchoose/choose-shampoo There are some that are geared towards both.  Neem & Tea Tee, Herb Garden, Ayurvedic, Nettle.  Read the reviews. Id probably try Neem and Tea Teee first due to Tea tree's reputation, even though Neem didn't seem to help you.   HOWEVER, Although some of the others dont contain Tea Tree, some have Nettle (which has been proven to have antifungal properties).  For example their  Herb Garden does not appear to have tea tree but has nettle and also Yucca which have BOTH been proven to have  antifungal properties in labs.   I haven't researched the last 2 on the short list.  Anyway read foe yourself.. for some reason the Herb Garden has lots of reviews on hair regrowth"

I would say if you want the best results for your hair, to cut out hairspray...however I am sure there are some options out there that contain natural ingredients that won't coat your hair in stuff you will need sulfates to remove or that cause dryness of the scalp and hair.  Maybe start researching into no poo safe hairsprays!  Wish I could help more, but I only use one styling product for curly hair so I am a little clueless about hairsprays that are no poo safe, or if there are any."

After that you might try washing with conditioner only (make sure it's one that is compatible with NoPoo).  This isn't rocket science, it's an attempt to educate the populace that we don't need to wash our hair with harsh shampoos on a daily basis (if ever!)."
NoPoo,3b6vpm,_pope_francis,3,Fri Jun 26 13:43:18 2015 UTC,"I second water only. My hair hasn't been greasy for a while, and I have been going without shampoo or baking soda for 4-5 weeks. Prior to this, I was using baking soda, but things would still get greasy every week or so. When I found out that washing with baking soda is bad for my hair, I decided to go WO (water only). My transition period was very short; I had maybe 3-4 days where my scalp was very oily. Then one day, seemingly without any effort on my part, it just stopped being greasy!   OP, if you want to do water only, I would highly suggest reading up on it so that you do not become discouraged when you find yourself in the greasy transition stage."

NoPoo,3b4kfe,silkydog2,3,Fri Jun 26 03:50:37 2015 UTC,"My hair is quite long (I am female), about halfway down my back.  I get finely ground rye flour (not the 'stoneground' one which has lots of bits in it), mix with about half a cup of water with sufficient flour to achieve a paste which is similar consistency to shampoo. Stir with spoon until smooth. This will work by itself, although sometimes I like to add about a teaspoon of honey.  I don't measure the flour, but estimate it is around 1/4 cup.  Just as long as the mixture is not too runny otherwise it wont stay in your hair.  Then massage it into your scalp thoroughly, before rinsing. The one time it didn't work was when I didn't use enough mixture and I guess it didn't make contact with my entire scalp.  I can go for 4-5 days after washing with the rye.  Rye flour is cheap so it's easy to give it a go (unlike the rhassoul clay which I also tried but with bad results). Good luck!"

NoPoo,3b3txh,greycrash,4,Thu Jun 25 19:12:28 2015 UTC,"American Crew Forming Cream, as with AC's Fiber and Pomade, contain several ingredients that will leave residue over time which therefore should be avoided. One example is lanolin wax, an ingredient that is practically the opposite of water soluble. I'm currently in the same position as you: I want a no-poo friendly hair product to use, but they're pretty limited, unfortunately.  To make sure a hair product is going to work fine with no-poo, check to make sure that none of its ingredients are listed here as those that should be avoided.   I haven't personally used either of these products I'm going to recommend, but I have heard many good things about Suavecito, and I made sure that all of its ingredients have been ok-ed by the link above. You can also try Admiral's Medium Hold Fiber Pomade, but don't try Admiral's other two products because they each contain a type of wax that will leave residue over time.  Personally, I've been using Axe Spiked Up Look Extreme Hold Gel because it was the only hair product I had at home other than AC Forming Cream, once I realized it was indeed not no-poo friendly! I was surprised to find that it worked really well. It gives me medium hold with low to medium shine, depending on how much I choose to use, and it's really cheap! I got it for $6.29 at my local Target. I can show photos of how it looks if requested. It washes out easily with just water, and it holds for nearly the whole day! It does start to weaken its hold by the end of the day and also when I sweat, but it does its job really well for such a cheap product!  Hope that helped!"

This is the one I used, consisting of ""mountain spring water, Coconut oil, olive oil, soy wax, Leatherwood Beeswax and honey, castor oil, seaweed extract"" and beer.  As for daily showering, keep showering after working out as needed. Don't wet your hair every day though. Water is a solvent which both won't wash away all the oil  and will dehydrate your hair. Instead, try brushing with a boar bristle brush when dry. BBBs are amazing things. If that won't cut it alone, you could rub your hair on a clean towel when damp I suppose."

You could start by slowly decreasing the frequency with which you wet/rinse your hair. You also sound like a good candidate for water only, might be worth a shot if you don't produce a lot of oil; it could give you an opportunity for your hair to hold on to some and become conditioned and happy.  You could replace your once a week shampoo with a 1:2 acv to water rinse instead of shampoo. Your hair will be stinky while wet, but once it dries there is no vinegar scent at all, I promise! The vinegar will condition your hair and help cleanse, nourish, and exfoliate the scalp.  If you really love your shampoo, there are a few brands you can check out that are no poo approved. You could even consider getting one of their conditioners and cowashing. Some brands are Shea Moisture, Curls, and Carol's Daughter."

NoPoo,3aq32r,mikestries,3,Mon Jun 22 16:15:47 2015 UTC,"This isn't dandruff, it's the built up natural oils from your scalp called sebum. With shampoo, you washed all of this away, and now your scalp is still over producing it and it is collecting on your scalp. The best way to combat this (although it's still transitioning into less production) is to scritch/scratch the scalp with your fingernails or a fine tooth comb, then rinse very well in the shower. I never used the baking soda or anything either. But just know that you'll always have to do this without shampoo... Your scalp never stops producing the sebum (it's protective oil for your scalp/hair). Usually I blow dry my roots when I get out of the shower to remove any other little flakiness.   Good luck! The transition from oily, flaky, gross takes awhile since your scalp has to get used to producing less sebum. It took me about 2 months to really like my hair again.   Source: Water only washes for almost 6 years."
NoPoo,3aq32r,stochasticverse,2,Mon Jun 22 17:49:49 2015 UTC,"The flakes most no-poo users experience are a combination of dead skin from their scalp, and the natural oils/sebum produced by their body. As /u/stochasticverse mentioned, this mixture is usually washed (or more correctly stripped) by normal detergent shampoos.  Because no-poo doesn't strip the scalp, this leftover skin and oil tend to cling to hair even after washing.  One of the key grooming requirements of going water-only is to regularly scritch-and-preen.  This is a combination of gently ""scritching"" (scratching and massaging) your scalp with your fingertips and/or a comb with rounded ends.  Then you run small sections of hair between your index and middle finger, distributing the oils from root-to-tip.  Finally, you finish the grooming routine by brushing small sections of hair root-to-tip with a boar bristle brush.  (Some people skip using their fingers to preen and go straight to the BBB.)  This should help with the flaking.  Some people find that not wetting their hair daily helps to keep flaking down.  Wetting the scalp daily, especially if you take hot showers, can cause dry skin which will increase the flakes."

NoPoo,3anj2z,typhona,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:47:16 2015 UTC,"Causing skin-cell death sounds like a scary and obviously bad thing, but the reality is more nuanced.  Things like alpha-hydroxy acid, salacylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, microdermabrasion, etc... are commonly used to treat acne and skin scarring. They're also all things that essentially kill off the top layer of skin. This is, in some cases, a good thing. Your skin turns over new healthier cells faster in response to repeated cell death on the top layer, this has an acne-fighting effect, and also lends itself to hastening the disappearance and smoothening of scar tissue.  Similarly, basically every anti-dandruff and anti-balding shampoo contains an ingredient that gently kills and helps slough off the topmost layer of skin on your scalp, eliminating dandruff in the process and improving the health of the skin below.  As far as lavender oil goes, I don't know the specifics, I doubt it ""causes havoc"" though."
NoPoo,3anj2z,SobrietySchmobriety,2,Mon Jun 22 14:54:53 2015 UTC,"This ""cell death"" is partially why lavender works on dandruff.

Lavender is also high in phytoestrogens and can break you out along the hairline or face so try just to keep it on your scalp, and after 20 minutes, cleanse the oil away well.  However, when it comes to dandruff treatment, I would suggest alternating vinegar rinses and pure aloe vera massaged into the scalp and left for 15 minutes."

Sniff the tissue. Relax.   Do you sweat a lot? I wouldn't advise switching to a natural deodorant because anything else is not antiperspirant. Some will recommend baking soda, but it burns the skin. Regarding safety claims, studies have shown a correlation with breast cancer, but not a causation. In fact, one study found that those who used antiperspirant deodorant and shaved their armpits more often had a better 5 year prognosis just because they examined their armpits.

This is why some people get body odor, halitosis, smelly feet and others don't!  Now, if you aren't sure if it smells, rub your fingers on your scalp for 10 seconds and smell them.  Do your fingers smell pretty clean, or is there a terrible new scent coming from them?  This will give you an idea of what others are smelling on you!    Honey and ginger rinses can nix the smelly bacteria and help you last longer without smell.  You can do honey rinse by itself, and ginger by itself as well.  Ginger tea is also really effective.  One warning, honey does contain some hydrogen peroxide, so with regular use it might slightly lighten your hair over time.  If that is a real breaker, definitely opt for ginger tea in bulk!  Simply steep the tea ten mins or until cool, and pour on your scalp.  Wait ten minutes and then rinse!  As far as deodorant, try checking this brand out.  I have been pleased with it."

I read on other sites that the Crystal deodorants are still unhealthy because they still have aluminum (in the ammonium alum). I read a rebuttal from a Crystal representative that claimed that this is not problematic, though. The representative claimed that the alum molecules are too large to enter pores/ the skin and are therefore safe.  I am also concerned because I would think the armpit is maybe supposed to have a natural balance of flora, and by killing that off everyday I would be messing it up. I also think the constant killing of bacteria might irritate the skin. Do you have any information on these issues? If the deodorant really is safe and killing the bacteria is not an issue with irritating the skin or messing up some kind of ecosystem or the immune system, I would definitely try out the Crystal deodorant.

NoPoo,3aok1b,DreadedSeriousDog,2,Tue Jun 23 02:44:38 2015 UTC,"Okay!  If you want to go totally natural with it i have the perfect option for you.  You can make a bacteria fighting solution out of sea salt and ginger tea.  Put into a spray bottle and mist your armpits before getting dressed.  Once your pits dry you will have natural goodness odor fighting.  I find it lasts about 8 hours before sweating it totally off, so just keep that in mind!  Applying before bedtime allows for quicker get ready time in the morning if you don't have time to let it dry.  Some people recommend coconut oil or baking soda for natural deodorant.  Not a fan of either of these options.  Coconut oil fights bacteria, yes.   However, when it does, the coconut oil begins smelling just like vomit.  Probably the only thing worse than pit odor!  Baking soda ""seems"" to work, but it is actually counterintuitive due to its stripping and drying properties because it can overstimulate the oil glands in the armpit.  Oil is one of bacteria's favorite foods, and if you produce more of it and have a weak skin barrier (because the barrier is stripped away by baking soda) the bacteria will get pretty cozy and have a party.  Can you say smelly?  Hope the info helps you out!"

Coconut oil is pretty luscious, but when it interacts with bacteria it starts to smell like acrid vomit.  I switched over to avocado oil and really been loving it.  It's not super heavy so I have even been able to use it to tame flyaway hairs right before leaving the house.  Doesn't give my hair that dirty, oily look like coconut and olive have left my hair."
NoPoo,3akpt9,TheShotgunBetty,2,Thu Jun 25 18:17:29 2015 UTC,Ah. A good tip.   Coconut oil is delicious and is 2/3 MCT which feeds the brain by a non-glucose pathway. So why waste it.  Laughing from nerdsville.

NoPoo,3ajazh,soleblanket,3,Sat Jun 20 19:15:29 2015 UTC,Maybe try low poo and transition into water only? Whatever you decide to do just know that it's going to take some experimenting before you find something that works for you.
NoPoo,3ajazh,SpaceAgePimpin,3,Sun Jun 21 00:03:03 2015 UTC,"If your hair is greasy, flaky and you don't have a BBB, I'd bet that those flakes aren't dandruff. It's probably sebum.   Go buy a BBB and find a conditioner which contains nothing ending in -cone or -xane. Post ingredients on here if you need to and we'll tell you if it's suitable.   Water only isn't suitable for long hair which hasn't been trained using cowashing or BS/ACV. It won't end well."

NoPoo,3ajazh,apoocalypse,2,Sun Jun 21 22:20:35 2015 UTC,"Hi there! I can sympathise, I was in a bit of a flap about my hair last week (itchy, dry and flaky scalp from having to wash my hair daily just to keep it presentable) and decided to try ditching the shampoo but it took a lot of research for me to come up with a practical alternative. I opted to try rye flour mixed with water for cleaning my hair as (a) I already had the flour in my cupboard and (b) it's so cheap it didn't matter if it failed. It's taken me about a week to get the hang of using it (it takes more massaging to get hair clean than normal shampoo, and a much more thorough rinsing to get the flakes out of hair and ears) and I've had some dodgy hair days but my scalp's been happier than it's been in years and when I've nailed the method my hair's been gorgeous, glossy and soft.  I've got a brush with natural bristles and it's great whether you no poo or not, it helps separate the strands and makes your hair look smoother. (Just don't use it on wet hair, use a wide toothed comb for detangling.) On my fail days, it really helped turned my oil slick hair into something with a semblance of style. I wouldn't overthink the purchase, just go with a brand that suits your economics and ethics.  I'm finding it really is a case of experimenting, and giving yourself and your hair time to get used to a new routine. Hope you find something that works for you. :)"
NoPoo,3ajazh,apoocalypse,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:27:35 2015 UTC,Interesting! That is something I will definitely consider. Thank you for the advice. I'm definitely getting a BBB. It cannot get any worse.
NoPoo,3ajazh,SobrietySchmobriety,2,Sun Jun 21 12:53:42 2015 UTC,"No worries. :) In your other comment you mentioned you'd got a Lush shampoo bar. For info, I've used these for ages, as shampoos they're the best I've tried and they won't give you any product buildup but they won't help your scalp. The dry skin I've had on my scalp is not dandruff and I can remember having had it with all shampoos I've used since my teens, and even with shampooing less frequently. Within less than a week of not using anything with SLS on my scalp it's completely cleared up and my skin is normal. The shampoo might still be ok to use now and then but listen to your skin."

NoPoo,3aenx7,jillbe,5,Fri Jun 19 14:40:24 2015 UTC,"I use baking soda and ACV washes whenever I take a shower, and if I skip the baking soda, my scalp becomes noticeably more flaky and my hair will become noticeably more greasy. If I skip out on the vinegar, my hair will feel stiff and dry.  I'm confused by the fact that you used bleach on your hair (which is extremely alkaline) and yet are now concerned about the ph of a baking soda rinse. Baking soda is alkaline, but not nearly as much as bleach or most soaps.  You've put your hair and scalp through a lot recently, so there is going to be an adjustment period while your body finds a new balance.  I'd recommend trying the baking soda rinse- just a teaspoon or less, dissolved into a cup of water, and poured over your head in the shower. Work your fingers through your hair and scalp as if you were lathering up, and try to loosen and abrade some of the flakes. then rinse and repeat with the ACV dissolved in a cup of water.   Try this for a few weeks and see if things start feeling better.   Another component to the flakiness could be your diet. I know when I eat a lot of sugary and processed foods my dandruff starts to act up. I'd try changing your diet too to see if that helps.  Edit: I forgot to add, try doing this with every shower you take, not just once a week. For me I've found the consistency really helps my hair."
NoPoo,3aenx7,adriennemonster,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:19:53 2015 UTC,"100% do not use baking soda on your hair or scalp ever, and especially never ever on an already irritated scalp. Baking soda is too harsh for scalp, it strips and dries it severely.  If your scalp is already flaking and unbalanced, using baking soda with your scalp in this condition you may begin to develop sores on your scalp that will form scabs. Eek!  Also, sodium bicarbonate denatures the proteins of your hair. Your hair is composed almost entirely of amino acid chains (proteins) and baking soda comes in and breaks those chains. The broken chains feel slippery to the touch so many get the impression their hair is getting ""soft"" and continue using it until severe hair or scalp damage occurs. Just simply do not ever use baking soda. An alternative is rye flour, it has a neutral pH and won't destroy your scalp and hair."
NoPoo,3aenx7,TheShotgunBetty,0,Mon Jun 22 18:59:33 2015 UTC,"I only used bleach once, at the hair salon. That is the difference. Not regularly to wash my hair.  I eat zero carb now so it's definitely not my diet. Almost no processed foods (except bacon), a lot of fats, no sugar. No matter how my diet has been it's just been like this my whole life :/ and worse now I guess because of the bleach.  I think I will try the baking soda though. Even if it doesn't help my scalp/dries it out, it's only for a few weeks. I also just read about someone using goat milk soap to wash with and people seem to agree it helps with flakes. I found one from a small farm that is a castile/goat milk soap, so if the baking soda and ACV don't work I can try that.   I thought cleaning my hair every time I shower (every day) would be bad for my scalp? Or is that only due to shampoo?   Thanks for the help!"
NoPoo,3aenx7,brundlefly93,2,Fri Jun 19 17:49:12 2015 UTC,"Hey =]  I am not sure about using baking soda/vinegar, so although I can't help you there, I can give you advice about a water only routine you might try. I've been water only for over a year...this is what I do- I have different brushes, one for detangling and brushing, one is for pushing oil, like a boar bristle brush or even a fine toothed brush can work. Brush your hair a LOT. before bed, before getting it wet, if you like, after it dries. Also, make sure you wash your brushes pretty much every time/every few times you use them. Playing with your hair/""scritching"" and ""preening"" helps a lot too, especially when your hair gets build up or anything like that. In the wash, theres not much to it, just make scrubby scalp motions as if you were washing with shampoo. There is an old saying that my grandmother used to tell me when i was growing up - women who brush their hair 100 times a night have beautiful hair. I think with nopoo, it is true...Good luck !"

This works really really well for me. However,  it took me about six months to get really good and reproducible results. During the transition I sometimes used apple vinegar (probably on every fifth wash or so)  and a cold water rinse at the end of the shower. This really helped with the greasy helmet feeling. brushing my dry hear with a boar bristle brush before and especially after the wash also really helped me.  I hope this helps you! Stay strong!"

I can't  really speak for hair care, but when using bentonite clay for face masks, it's recommend  to dilute the clay using a 1:1 ratio.

I much prefer using no poo friendly products on most of my clients, even if I do use silicone every now and then for heat protection (mostly water soluble silicates). Maybe you could bring your own cleanser/condish/stylers and say you're concerned about ingredients or the environment or allergies if she just doesn't get it.  I will tell you that trying to get color product off of a client's hair with water only or even acv or bs in a salon sink is not even close to easy, and immediately post color service you do want some kind of lower pH conditioning product added to stop oxidation (depending on the product) and seal in the color molecules by closing your cuticle layer. Many color lines include silicates and sulfates as part of the color formula so it's easier to wash out after, so it may be that the cleanser needs to have some silicone to remove the silicate.

It gets greasy at the start, but since you have a pixie cut I think you'll have it better than most. I'm not sure how co-washing might affect the color, though when my sister dyed her hair blue, I remember her mixing the dye with conditioner to maintain color.  Been nopoo for 5 months and I co-wash now around 3 times a month, and use WO otherwise. Sometimes I use ACV wash because I feel it removes some of the product build up.

NoPoo,3a6rz6,thefapper1,2,Wed Jun 17 17:52:37 2015 UTC,"1) I worked incrementally to go nopoo. It definitely helps to avoid a bad adjustment period. I went from washing with sulfate shampoo every other day to washing with sulfate-free shampoo and stretching washes and now I'm WO with 2 weeks in between washes. So, yes, it works. Keep stretching until you reach a comfortable point.  2) It's your choice whether to rinse or not. My suggestion would probably be to try not to, but that also depends on how you wear your hair, how oily it gets, how much you care, etc. Scritching and Preening are super helpful for stretching washes without rinsing.  3) Dry, for sure, and detangled. It distributes oil down your hair shaft, and to do that, it needs a nice, uninterrupted path"
NoPoo,3a6rz6,NitaB,2,Wed Jun 17 18:46:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!  Couple questions for you: How long did it take you to get to 2 weeks without washing?  Do you WO everyday?  My hair gets pretty oily still, does this mean I should try to avoid rinsing it on no wash days?  Lastly, is it a good idea to brush before showering?"
NoPoo,3a6rz6,NitaB,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:36:02 2015 UTC,"It's been about a year and a half for me, but I took it nice and slow, not shocking my scalp or going through any kind of greasiness for more than a day or two. I don't WO every day, only once every two weeks or so, (I wear a cute, dorky shower cap in the shower and SMP every day.)  Not rinsing will probably make it more oily, but SMP will help you stretch washes without rinsing, so it's up to you. Since you're washing every other day, it might be good to try going without rinsing. Or you could try substituting rinsing every other wash (like wash-nothing-rinse-nothing-wash). There are an infinite number of possibilities for how you can organize your wash schedule.  Yes, brush before washing, however you wash. Brushing wet hair is damaging (which you may or may not care about depending on your type/length/caring about haircare)  Eta: It has been a year and a half since I started. It only took a few months to get to washing once a week, and I stayed at that point for a few months. It depends on what your personal goals are for your washing routine. Are you going for completely WO, WO with a 'once in a while' shampoo, CO, just stretching washes, or other alternative washing method?"
NoPoo,3a6rz6,NitaB,2,Thu Jun 18 14:53:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks for answering my questions.  My end goal is to do water only with shampooing once in awhile.  Over the years of shampooing with really harsh stuff like head and shoulders, I noticed that my hair has lost the luster it once had, slowly but surely it kept getting worse and worse so I'm trying to get back what I had when I was in my early teens.    When my hair is shorter I need to use product to style it, I have a water soluble pomade but water doesn't totally wash out the stuff so I will need to still shampoo.  Right now just trying to get the oiliness handled.  It feels less gross without a day of washing which is a nice plus so far haha."

NoPoo,3a2ofk,TheShotgunBetty,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:21:57 2015 UTC,"You may actually have dry scalp.  The hormone shift you experienced might have actually caused dryness and in turn over stimulation of oil and overproduction of sebum.  Though it might seem counterintuitive, try going conditioner only and focusing on your scalp for a few weeks.  Monitor your oil production over this period.  If it gets better, you may simply have dry scalp, and the imbalance is causing the clumpy sebum slick.    PS.  Friendly wisdom, use at least twice as much conditioner as you normally would when cowashing for the greatest effects!"

Dandruff can be caused by several things, to include fungal infections on your scalp to irritated oily skin to dry skin.  Tea tree oil works on all of these!    Make sure to dilute the tea tree oil in water before applying it to your scalp- it's pretty strong stuff.  You can use it in the shower, or better yet, leave it in your scalp overnight.  You know how Head n' Shoulders has that nice, cool tingly feeling to it?  So does tea tree oil!    I don't have terribly dandruff, but when I get a bit itchy and flaky I apply it while in the shower and feel 20 times better afterwards, plus I'm flake free.  Give it a try!"

Also, I use a boar bristle brush and my fingers to distribute the grease away from the scalp and into the lenght of the hair. I do this before and after every wash. Especially in the beginning you should wash your brush quite often to prevent getting the old grease onto your fresh hair. hope this helps!

I just use a 2 on the sides, I blend the left side in just a little bit (so it's not completely disconnected like a typical undercut) and then on the right side, where the hair falls over, I just cut it all the way up. The back is the hard part for me, it took a few tries and some kind of ugly in between phases to get it to blend right.   As far as the top, it's mostly just scissor cutting when it needs touched up. It doesn't grow much longer than where it is now though.  If you were asking your barber for this cut, I would just ask for a sort of tame undercut. Just ask him not to disconnect the sides (I wouldn't go lower than a 2 on the sides if you don't want it buzzed) and he should know what to do on top.  Did that help?

Coconut oil just stayed there! It's been the only reason I've caved and used shampoo in an entire year. I started using a very tiny amount of olive oil about once a week, and it's done wonders.  I've never heard of coconut vinegar, but I'd probably try it just to see how it goes. I use regular white vinegar maybe once every two months."

My very ends are basically always tangled now and it sucks. I managed to get the coconut oil out with repeated COwashing and then some rye flour so all the washing just seemed to dry it out more! So with olive oil, do you just put it on dry hair and wash it out or what? I always thought a heavy oil like that would be hard to get out but I could give it a go!  I'm definitely gonna give it a try. Most sites don't talk about watering it down so I'll need to experiment with that."

For the first three months my hair was super greasy every two to three days of WO too. I co-washed twice a week when I had to leave the house for school, the rest of the week i used WO. I used a conditioner with no silicone as instructed for cowashing.  If my hair was extra greasy, prior to bathing, I would powder with corn starch concentrating on the roots. I would leave this on to soak up some of the oil,  then rinse the oily powder away by co-washing.   To remove build up, every once in a while, I would clarify with ACV. In the tropical weather this left a vinegar smell even with thorough rinsing l so I switched to diluted lemon juice. I only did this rarely though because my hair might bleach in the sun.  I did that for about three months until I could use WO for longer periods. Now I have been WO for about two weeks already and don't feel too greasy that I'm embarassed to go out. That's it. Hope that can help you somehow.  Edit: format and grammar"

NoPoo,39p9mp,stochasticverse,2,Sat Jun 13 15:03:59 2015 UTC,"My best advice is time. I've noticed a trend among first timers getting rid of shampoo but using various other things to try and avoid the inevitable greasy/oil slick look from transitioning.   Try using a hard BBB before rinsing with water. And also ""scritch"" the scalp with yourfingernails or a fine tooth comb. I usually sit and watch tv while I'm doing this, then hop in the shower and alternate between hot and cold water (about 5 minutes). A blow dryer can help remove any residual flakes from your scalp.   I've been WO for almost 6 years now and I remember that horrendous early phase. Took about 8-9 weeks before I loved my hair again. I wore a lot of buns and scarves."
NoPoo,39p9mp,stochasticverse,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:21:12 2015 UTC,"Ah perhaps I've been expecting the transition phase to be over already, maybe I just need to give it more time as you say. 6 years! How often do you WO wash your hair? Is it frequent or once a week or so? Thank you."
NoPoo,39p9mp,atrophying,2,Sat Jun 13 21:13:21 2015 UTC,It's about once a week I'll scritch and rinse. It looks really good throughout that week but I like to prevent build up. It's nice to get to the point where you just don't have to worry about your hair. Which is why I decided to go no-poo in the first place!
NoPoo,39p9mp,atrophying,2,Sun Jun 14 03:38:52 2015 UTC,"I've been no-poo for 9 years, WO for 7. You've hit the detox phase, and your hair's going to go a little nuts before it gets used to not being stripped dry.  When I hit that phase, I used a mixture of bentonite clay, lavender tisane, and dilute ACV. It was a lot like making mudpies for my hair, but it kept down the excess sebum without drying everything out. Using cornstarch never really did anything for me, and brushing made it worse (I have curly hair, though, so brushes and my hair don't really go together to begin with). That phase lasted about six months for me, although it was really only the second month where it got bad. By the third month it only got greasy when I exerted myself, by the end of the sixth not even heavy sweats could make it greasy.  At least for me, I've found that a weekly rinse with unpasteurized ACV is a necessary part of keeping things flake-free. 2 tbsp to about a pint of water, comb in, rinse out. Considering that no commercial dandruff treatment ever worked for me, I'm okay with the trade-off.   These days, I rinse my hair with lukewarm water most days to reset my curls, and do the ACV thing once a week. If it weren't for the curls I could probably go 3-4 days without a rinse before I noticed it. It's a huge PITA to wait out that transition period, but it was totally worth it for me. My hair texture and curl improved so much once I was completely WO, and it saves a bunch of time and money."
NoPoo,39p9mp,ForeverMadrone,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:54:29 2015 UTC,"I have ACV and bentonite clay so I think I'll try a mudpie. Can you tell me what ratios you use?

I hope I can get to a stage like yours because aside from the trouble I've had, I really want to continue nopoo. Thanks for your detailed advice."
NoPoo,39p9mp,lannawho,2,Sat Jun 13 23:07:05 2015 UTC,"To be honest it was a pretty long time ago and I don't really remember. I think it was about equal parts clay and vinegar, then water that I'd boiled (that's important! clay 'poo with tap water goes bad after a couple of days) a handful of lavender buds, let cool, and strained. It was enough water that it was kind of slippery, like really thick conditioner. I think I probably put something else in it as well - a teaspoon or so of either honey or olive oil, maybe some flaxseed gel or aloe too? Here's a close approximation, but there's lots of ways to customize it for your hair type. Just a warning with clay washing - don't leave it on long at all or it'll dry out your hair. It's not an immediate effect, just one of those things that it's possible to go too long with. I would coat my hair with it like co-washing, scrub up the rest of my body, and rinse it out a couple minutes later.  Hope this helps!"

I think vinegar rinse would be a perfect no poo option for you!  It cleanses and conditions, and brings vitality back to the hair.  The biggest change I noticed with my hair was how shiny it became!  Use a 1:1 ratio of raw apple cider vinegar with the mother and water.  Just pour over the scalp and hair, comb thru, and rinse!  If you want deeper conditioning you can leave it on for 3 to 5 minutes and a few drops of avocodo oil on your hair after it dries.

NoPoo,39ewni,MrAnna123,4,Thu Jun 11 07:04:52 2015 UTC,"Ditch the bicarb! That is really just meant for the transition period and is too harsh for long term use. After trying lots of things, I've come up with  a hodge-podge of things I do when my hair isn't at its best.   I'll elaborate: I guess I've learned to listen to my hair and see what it needs. If my hair is dirty (like from camping or dust or exercise) then I use a little bit of shampoo bar to get it clean. If my scalp is itchy and flaky I use rye flour mixed with a few drops of tea tree oil. If it's just kind of lifeless then I do an ACV rinse to bring the shine and bounce back. If everything is good I just do water only with hot  water. I also got some rosewater to spritz after water only so I smell good.   I wanted a ""regimen"" but my hair doesn't seem to need things on a schedule, so this is the best solution I've come up with."
NoPoo,39ewni,sparklystarfish,2,Thu Jun 11 16:41:58 2015 UTC,I cowash with suave naturals (V05 is lighter if your hair is less dry than mine) and condition with tressemme naturals. It's like $7 for 2-3 months worth of product. Would recommend.

Bentonite clay was what did it for me! I use the mixture once a week, and the whole week it stays smooth and nice.   What I use: 1 tbs bentonite clay. 1 tbs acv. 1 tbs honey. 5tbs filtered water. It's meant to be runny"
NoPoo,39ewni,hellosss,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:13:06 2015 UTC,"I used bicarb soda and ACV for a year until it was making my hair dry, then I tried rhassoul clay but that was not a success: hair felt like greasy straw even right after washing.   I read about folks using rye flour and gave that a go -  love it, it leaves my hair very soft (much softer than when I was using bicarb) and I can go for longer without washing. I now wash about twice/wk. I follow it up with ACV (1 tablespoon ACV:1 cup water) mainly from habit, but it doesn't feel necessary. Get the finely ground rye flour, not the stuff with bits in it, and mix with water until you get a consistency similar to shampoo. For longish hair, use around 1/2C total mixture. You do need to rinse well to get rid of all the flour particles.  Rye flour has a neutral pH so it doesn't mess with your hair."
NoPoo,39ewni,silkydog2,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:56:12 2015 UTC,Do you use any hair products? Do you use anything with silicones? Sometimes going the cowashing route with a clarifying shampoo once or twice a month is the better route for people who can't avoid a lot of buildup in their hair. It's what I do personally and my hair has never looked better.

NoPoo,39c2k4,EHLOthere,2,Wed Jun 10 23:59:25 2015 UTC,"Cornstarch/ dry shampoo between washes.  During your wash, make sure to rub your scalp with the pads of your fingers.  Is the entire length of the hair oily? Or just the scalp? If your ends are drier you can try using a softer-bristed brush to distribute the oils downward.  If you're just starting out, don't worry too much about taking showers more often (like every other day). Over time you'll be able to stretch them out."

NoPoo,39c2k4,redemily25,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:13:04 2015 UTC,Do you rinse your hair with water everyday or just not clean it at all?  When I first stopped using shampoo I needed to soak my hair in warm water for 3+ full minutes everyday in the shower and even then was forced to use shampoo every 1-2 weeks to keep the grease away.  Slowly as my hair adjusted I didn't need to rinse with water for as long each day and was able to space out my Shampoo usage.  Now many years later I only need to rinse my hair with water for 30-60 seconds per day and shampoo about once per month and it works for me.
NoPoo,39c2k4,DICKPIXTHROWAWAY,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:31:07 2015 UTC,When I started no poo I started with WO washing from the start. My hair got really gross the first couple weeks.

NoPoo,39cs6x,the_golden_prairies,2,Wed Jun 10 22:06:28 2015 UTC,Use betonite clay to restore your hairs ph level. Then clean your hair with a natural soap bar that you can get usually at local grocery stores. Use ACV to shine and thin your hair if you like that.

NoPoo,39afpt,anonlymouse,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:52:49 2015 UTC,"Are you exfoliating your scalp every 3 to 4 days?  This is important if you are prone to flakes and using vinegar.  Vinegar helps with dandruff in many ways, but one of those ways is actually promoting cell turn over of the scalp.  You will need to gently scratch the flakes out of your hair every three to four days.  As you continue using vinegar, you will notice fewer flakes each time.  Keep with it!    In addition, a few things you can add to your vinegar rinse that will help combat flakes and soothe the scalp are pure aloe, tea tree oil, lemon balm, or orange oil!"

NoPoo,3999gc,queenblackacid,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:18:27 2015 UTC,It could have been. I don't really know. Is dandruff supposed to fall of your scalp after you ruffle your hair with your head upside down? Because when I did that nothing came off
NoPoo,3999gc,MidnightSlinks,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:31:40 2015 UTC,"Sounds like sebum. Dandruff is just dead skin. It can get caught in your hair if you're just sitting there, but it should easily fall out if you ruffle your hair.  You might want to ease into no-poo by co-washing. Pick up some silicone-free conditioner. You will want to use 2-3x more than you would if you were conditioning after a wash, but you want to gently scrub your scalp like you might do with shampoo."

Straight henna will be more reddish, but I think there are some other options too.  This site was highly recommended when I was looking into henna, and the employees are very helpful and will ask you to send a picture of your hair and tell you how to achieve what you are looking for: http://www.hennaforhair.com/  (also, if you look up henna and people are demonizing it, it's probably because they used shit box henna dyes that include metals that turn hair greenish. Food grade henna will not do this, and many people use it as a conditioning treatment.)"

NoPoo,397hul,Abster_dam,2,Tue Jun 9 21:35:32 2015 UTC,No problem. How much acv are you using in your rinse? Cause I've never had a vinegar smell on my curly hair. I use a 2/1 ratio teaspoon/8oz.

NoPoo,397hul,SallySubterfuge,2,Wed Jun 17 22:33:54 2015 UTC,"You can use lemon juice diluted in water, or citric acid tablets/powder dissolved in water.  The dilutions for both are different (I believe the lemon juice is something like 3 tbsp per cup of water, and the citric acid is 1 tsp of powder per cup of water).  Both of these will do essentially the same things as your ACV.    Natural shampoo bars and natural soaps are also excellent choices for cleansing, and are less drying than baking soda.  However, most recommend using some type of acidic rinse as a conditioner after washing to prevent soap scum buildup.  There are also numerous nopoo methods that don't need any acidic rinse.  The honey wash on the sidebar is popular, as are rinses and scrubs using things like rassoul clay.  Depending on your hair type, you may be a candidate for co-washing (conditioner-only washing) with a silicone-free conditioner."

NoPoo,397hul,Malassah,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:55:35 2015 UTC,"People with wavy and curly hair are usually the best candidates, especially if their hair is fairly thick.  Those with thick, straight hair that tends to be normal-to-dry also have good results.  People with thin, straight hair or straight hair that's more oily (such as myself) find that co-washing can be too heavy for their hair type.

NoPoo,396utv,seriousmoonlighter,2,Tue Jun 9 19:55:14 2015 UTC,"I would strongly advise against it, especially if your hair is already damaged.  To rip from an article directly:   ""...if you are trying to retain moisture in your hair then you may want to refrain from using silicone products.  Why?  Well, in addition from having to use drying sulfate based cleansers, the silicone coating on the hair prevents moisture, protein, or other products from penetrating the hair shaft.   Additionally, when an overload of silicone products are applied to hair, the buildup from the silicone coating eventually causes breakage.  (If your hair is already dry or prone to breakage)"""

NoPoo,391706,BrightKnight141,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:58:47 2015 UTC,"To be completely honest with you, there is so little fragrance in a 16 ounce bottle of NoPoo, that it should really be considered for fragrance purposes only.  We put between 10 and 40 DROPS of fragrance in an entire bottle.  That being the case, the EO/FO is so diluted that it likely isn't going to provide any benefit other than fragrance.  We do list the common benefits of EO's throughout our site as ANY benefit is important to some people.  That said, break it down to fragrance.  Orange essential is just that.  It is pure 10x distilled orange essential oil.  Crazy strong and beautifully orange.    Greystone is a fragrance oil, and holds no reported value other than fragrance (or perhaps a value for aromatherapy).  The greystone is our #1 selling mens fragrance and is loved by women as well.  It covers the NoPoo natural scent quite well.  You want Minty, you GOT IT!  Order unfragranced and indicate in the notes what you want or drop me an email.  We have about 300 different EO/FO's, but wanted to keep the list short as it was becoming confusing for our customers.  However, we can always do custom scents for people.  We're just that cool =)   Hope that helps!"

If I were you I wouldn't bother buying just a sulfate shampoo since you'll only use it once.   I have a brush that has some BBB bristles but mostly nylon. It helps when I'm styling in a rush but other wise I haven't needed it much. I would still purchase a BBB tho

So many people swore by it, but I came to find out later the people who swore I should do it had only done it about two weeks.  Ahhh!  Trial and error, many many sessions of chopping off failed no poo experiment inches of hair, and almost tears, I have come to like my new system of using a rinse of no poo safe shampoo and water once a week in the summer (all that sweat and oil is such a drag!!) And once every two weeks in the cooler seasons.  I personally haven't tried Deva Curl products yet!  I feel bad, sorry.  However I have been using Shea Moisture Curl and Shine shampoo.  I have thick, curly hair so this is the best option I've found with my hair type, but if you have straight or thin hair, they also have other shampoos that are no poo safe and that will nourish and pamper your scalp and hair type.    Edit: I should clarify this is only my routine for getting my hair totally squeeky clean.  My normal routine is acv rinse, 1 part vinegar, 3 parts water.  This cleans and nourishes pretty well, but by two weeks (or one week in summer with extra sweat etc) I get the waxy buildup which is when I use the 1 part Shea moisture no poo safe shampoo, 8 parts water.  I usually mix this as I need it, as with the vinegar rinse so it doesn't mold or get weird."

NoPoo,38px16,RatherNotRegister,1 point,Sat Jun 6 05:28:35 2015 UTC,"Just like the other commentor, RatherNotRegister, I also have heard that BS/ACV isn't great for your hair.

This page goes into more information and also suggests alternatives to BS, which you could try:   http://blog.kanelstrand.com/2014/01/baking-soda-destroyed-my-hair.html  As for shampoo bars - I have never tried it, and I would recommend doing research before trying it. I say this because I've heard people recommend Dr. Bronner's bar for no poo, but when I looked into it, I found that this bar is also very high in pH (I think 9, which is around as high as baking soda is.) This makes me hesitant to use that bar, but there may be other bars out there that have a pH closer to that of hair.   I live in the US, but I found that you can order shampoo bars on the UK version of Amazon. http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2/277-4064661-1387710?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=shampoo+bar    Again, I would recommend doing your own research on whatever method you end up choosing, and see if you can find any downsides to it, like pH, or otherwise potentially detrimental factors to the method."
NoPoo,38px16,nopooq,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:16:18 2015 UTC,"I went straight WO right off the bat (don't use BS/ACV or anything else), and it takes a while for your scalp to adjust its sebum production. It took about 2 weeks for my hair to be a manageable oiliness, and about a month for it to level out completely. It's great now; when I shampoo'd, my family would complain that my head smelled ""heady"" unless I shampoo'd every day. Now I can go for two or more without washing my hair and nobody seems to mind.  Fortunately I'm a guy and my hair is pretty short, so the oily in-between phase wasn't that terrible, but you really have to stick with it and just ride out the oil.   Go WO for a month, minimum, and see where your baseline is at. After that, you can start adding things in if you still aren't satisfied."

This website describes a method that involves using a comb to get the hair/dust out, but instead of dipping it in water only, the author says to leave the bristles it in a solution of soap and water for about 10 minutes.   A few days ago I was wondering how to clean my brush properly, because the handle is wooden, and I was concerned that if I wet the handle, the moisture can cause the wood to expand and warp. I ended up searching Amazon reviews of my specific brush model for the word 'wash' and found how some other people washed it. I've heard people use soap, and even bar soap, instead of shampoo. I have heard of one person using a vinegar solution of 50% vinegar, 50% water. I opted to use super dilute dish soap instead of shampoo because if we are doing nopoo to avoid sulfates, then I surmised that washing the bristles in sulfated shampoo could lead to sulfates coating the bristles, which would presumably be transferred back onto my hair, voiding the whole goal of nopoo - but I could be wrong! I have only cleaned my brush once - and that was yesterday - so I can't really tell you much about how well my brush turned out being washed with dilute dish soap. It looks fine now, but I don't know if there are any long term effects of that. But from what I read about how other people use the brush, nobody else mentioned any issue with using dish soap to clean their brush.  Anyway, I think it depends on your brush. Does it have a wooden handle? If so, you probably don't want to avoid getting the whole brush wet because the moisture can warp the wood."

NoPoo,38kd1r,fuzzo,2,Fri Jun 5 04:04:21 2015 UTC,"Vinegar is acidic, but that's why you dilute it. Undiluted vinegar is strong enough for cleaning floors and toilets, so you definitely don't want to be putting something that strong on your scalp. All you need is a tablespoon or so of ACV in a bottle, then fill the rest of the bottle with water.   Baking soda on the other hand is a no poo no-no. It's way too basic regarding its pH level - it weakens the hair shaft and can cause breakage. I find that brushing my scalp with a boar bristle brush prior to showering helps free up any scalp buildup. I then use an ACV rinse with a few drops of tea tree oil as a shampoo, and condition my ends with a silicone-free conditioner."

NoPoo,38im95,penopopolis,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:04:16 2015 UTC,"Hopefully other people have some advice for you, but just to offer a different perspective, I've been doing no-poo for about a year, and I tried to do WO this winter and I couldn't make it work. I tried for about 2 months, and my hair was just too oily to live with, so eventually I gave up. The one thing that did help somewhat was blow-drying my hair, so if you don't do that already, give it a try. I think because it fluffs your hair up and keeps it in motion as it dries, the hair doesn't get as stuck together. But even then, I wasn't happy with it and it didn't get better for me.  But if you want to do no-poo but not water only, BS/ACV aren't your only options! You can buy sulfate-free shampoos that work great, and shampoo bars which are basically bars of a really nice, simple, natural soap. I got a bar of Dr. Bronner's (it was like $3 at Trader Joe's) to try out, and it's been working great for me so I haven't tried anything else yet. I just work up a lot of lather so I can get it into the roots really well, wash my hair normally, and do an ACV rinse after. I've been washing with soap once a week and washing with water and an ACV rinse every two or three or days, and I'm very happy with my hair now. I just couldn't hack WO, so don't feel bad if it turns out it's not right for you!"

NoPoo,38im95,blackbirdsongs,2,Thu Jun 4 17:56:45 2015 UTC,"Oh, and just FYI the Dr. Bronner's isn't labeled as a shampoo bar, it's just pure organic soap, which is the same thing as what other companies sell specifically as shampoo bars. I've been happy with it, but there are lots of options out there. This is the one I have: https://www.drbronner.com/DBMS/BARSOAP/OBPE05.html  It's peppermint, which is a stronger smell (though I don't think the smell stays in your hair), but they have a few other scents. I'll probably try the tea tree one when I run out, I love that smell. It was just an impulse purchase at TJ's that worked out really well :)"
NoPoo,38im95,blackbirdsongs,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:27:37 2015 UTC,"I started using it probably last September or October, then tried to do WO for a couple months in the winter before giving up and going back to washing. I definitely think my hair is healthier. It absorbs less water, so it dries a lot faster which is nice, and I think it's growing faster too, though it's hard to be sure. And once I got used to the different feeling of having some oil in your hair (that took awhile, but now that I'm used to it, it feels clean to me with some natural oil), I found it MUCH more manageable.   I used to have really difficult, thick hair that would get super poofy if I tried to blow-dry it or even brush it. I literally could only brush my hair right before I washed or it would just get huge and frizzy looking. And I had to keep it really long so that it was heavy enough to stay somewhat flat. Now I can brush it and blow-dry, and I've been cutting it shorter and shorter... I just cut it to a couple inches below my shoulders and it's not poofy at all! It's so nice for summer. I'm so much happier with it than when I was using shampoo. But it definitely took awhile to figure out what worked for me, and I'm still playing with it."

Two months isn't that long of a time for our bodies.  Did you alter your diet? Splurge on something?  Have you tried baking soda, vinegar, lemon juice, etc other home cleaners? Maybe your hair needed more than a hot water rinse, maybe it was actually dirty - or maybe your scalp was. Maybe you didn't brush for a day. Maybe the temperature changed with the season.  I keep a sulfate and silicone-free shampoo around in case my hair gets really bad, like if I decide to use Brylcreem and then need to remove it or I go swimming or to a construction site.Sometimes a day in the inner city or on the farm makes my hair dirty enough. If I need to clean, then a light application is all I use."
NoPoo,38dnxa,patron_vectras,3,Wed Jun 3 16:59:29 2015 UTC,You are over thinking it. I have used shampoo a couple times in the last year. It won't hurt a thing. Your scalp won't notice either. Not the once.
NoPoo,38dnxa,Sardonislamir,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:10:05 2015 UTC,i'm just over a month in i believe.. and i got to a point where my hair was super greasy too (i was doing a CO wash).. i used my NoPoo (that's the brandname) shampoo just once and hot DAMN.. its lookin' great again. i might just do that once in a while to keep my sanity... and it doesn't hurt anything anyways..
NoPoo,38b5qx,cheesyguy278,7,Wed Jun 3 02:03:53 2015 UTC,This is normal for me... do you think you might just be obsessing over it and thus noticing it when before you may not have been paying attention to your hair very much?
NoPoo,38b5qx,cyanoside,2,Wed Jun 3 03:48:04 2015 UTC,I did the same thing back when I was doing shampoo. You're not losing anymore hair than you were before. :P
NoPoo,38b5qx,awd3495,3,Wed Jun 3 04:10:50 2015 UTC,"The hair kinda clumps together with no poo and doesn't fall out as easily as with shampoo. so you do notice it more.   Unless you are losing 100-150 hairs a day, I wouldn't worry."
NoPoo,384903,aikokendo,3,Mon Jun 1 19:12:50 2015 UTC,"Sometimes just cutting a bit of your hair off can help a lot. My hair ends always get kinda broken after a while and they get more and more tangled the more broken they are, after a haircut they are a breeze again."

NoPoo,384903,ritsikas,2,Tue Jun 2 13:54:43 2015 UTC,"Mm then maybe do a coconut oil hair mask. Pretty much just lather your hair up with coconut oil then let it be in your hair for as long as possible, I just tied a plastic bag around my hair and chilled at home like that haha. It will really soften your hair."
NoPoo,384903,nirenem,2,Tue Jun 2 14:33:06 2015 UTC,"I know it sounds incredibly obvious, but I did always find just keeping it under a steady stream of water (colder is better) and just smoothing it out (curling my hands around individual locks and running them down the locks until they felt smooth) tended to git'er done fairly fast. I have curly hair too, and it reacts by turning into a bathmat if I put shampoo in it, but sometimes it's okay without conditioner if I'm just patient and gentle and use pleeeeeeenty of water."
NoPoo,384903,BABYCAKESxUNKILLABLE,4,Tue Jun 2 01:19:57 2015 UTC,"Ok! so I followed your advice today! I used the pineapple method before going to bed to avoid getting tangles in the back of my head where the issue is worse, so the tangles weren't as bad today. Then I added some conditioner to start working through some tangles and let the water run through the curls. It really helped :D"

NoPoo,384903,ShannonF27,2,Wed Jun 3 10:46:08 2015 UTC,Is a curly hair method to achieve second day curls.

I tend to use their conditioner on occasion. If I use any kind of styling product, I'll usually use the shampoo to wash it out later.  I'm definitely a fan of their product line, but I go without much more frequently these days. I would also recommend them as a good segue to the world of nopoo."
NoPoo,382sws,Kuxite,3,Mon Jun 1 13:14:30 2015 UTC,"Healthy hair has more oils for junk to stick to. It is a normal result. Don't fret dust and hairs that is what a bore bristle brush is supposed to do, clean out loose hair and debris and move oils down to the tips.  Pick the brush clean swipe some more and call it good to go.     I ignore smell myself since we are so conditioned to tie cleanliness with the smell of flowers. You would have to not wash at all to get anything that would be negatively noticeable. Natural, clean, healthy.    Waxy hair, I don't know. Sounds like build of of dead skin cells or said dust drying out oils. Pay attention to the timing. After a shower, been outside, did you sweat sleeping, on your pillow or is it dirty, wore a hat, had intimate relations, etc. Note what happens on good days and what proceeded the good day as well as on bad. You will eventually find the cause and thus a solution."

NoPoo,382sws,Sardonislamir,2,Mon Jun 1 15:05:11 2015 UTC,"I just use my fingers, pull most of it out. Don't get overly detail oriented or else you will need tweezers. hehe. Just keep it clean enough after you get the crap off your head so that you can now just focus on brushing oils."

NoPoo,382sws,Sardonislamir,2,Thu Jun 4 17:53:28 2015 UTC,"Also, expect oily and strange hair for some time, because an imbalance can persist even while doing right by your scalp. It takes a long while for scalp health to kick in and for you to learn your individual needs and what that looks like. Let alone the one thing in your environment or hygiene you have going against you that was not self evidently harming your intentions."

NoPoo,3805jh,shaymin66,4,Sun May 31 21:36:25 2015 UTC,"I recommend those starting with baking soda and apple cider vinegar to get a full understanding of how those two things effect the ph balance of your hair and how that effects it's overall health, a lot of people start with this routine but don't get the mixture right and damage their hair. As I understand it they need to be paired together and you wouldn't want to just put baking soda in your hair without acv? but a  little acv rinse by itself now and then isn't so bad as I understand it. I don't use this method so I am by no means an expert and the link on the sidebar for ph isn't working at the moment. Aside from that the side bar is incredibly helpful in finding things you can use if one method isn't to your liking. I found what works best for me isn't the most commonly used or talked about methods and it took a lot of experimentation, I recommend trying lots of things especially the ones you have at hand, raw honey, clay, salt water, rye flour. Your hair will go through the transition phase of oily/greasyness and you probably wont have to worry much about hair wax for that. Good Luck!"
NoPoo,3805jh,MalavethMorningrise,2,Sun May 31 22:16:32 2015 UTC,"I haven't needed an product since I started water only.

NoPoo,3805jh,NandalRewman,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:10:32 2015 UTC,Don't use baking soda without an acidic rinse!  You need to neutralize the alkalinity with some sort of acid or you will ruin your hair.

NoPoo,37ppig,kiradotee,13,Fri May 29 12:42:45 2015 UTC,"I'm a Deva stylist, and I use the Deva products at my backbar on almost everyone. I have a couple of people with allergies to ingredients. Palmer's contains Laureth 4, which is a surfactant (foaming agent). Just because a product is formulated for curls doesn't mean it can only be used on curl. I also recommend looking into SheaMoisture products, they're pretty No Poo friendly because all their surfactants are vegetable based and thereby more gentle.  Also, beware the term ""normal""; over half the world's population has some wave or curl pattern to their hair."
NoPoo,37ppig,hurrdresser,1 point,Fri May 29 15:15:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks. :)  I have a few more questions if you don't mind!  How often do you suggest using the DevaCurl No-Poo?  And is it worth having the DevaCurl One Conditioner? I've read it moisturises the hair a bit more but I have no idea if that's something I need or not. :/  P.S. I'm completely new to the no-poo experience, before I used a shampoo everyday, also drying the hair with a hair dryer after that. I did have a haircut recently, so I can survive without a hair dryer for the next few weeks. :)"
NoPoo,37ppig,hurrdresser,2,Sun May 31 17:34:56 2015 UTC,"I wash once or twice a week. It really depends on your hair and your needs, if you're working out a lot or swimming in chlorine or salt water, you may need it more frequently. If you start using No Poo and you don't need the extra conditioning, don't feel obligated to use it. I love One Condition, but I have wavy hair and it's completely unmanageable if I don't condish. I often cowash (conditioner in place of cleanser) if I'm traveling or in the winter when it gets dry. You may find One Condition a little heavier than your average conditioner not formulated for curls, so your hair may be a little weighted down. If you get really tangly, you may want to put conditioner on only your ends. I would say start with the No Poo and give it a good 2-3 washes to see whether you need a little more conditioning.  The most important thing about a non-foaming/surfactant free cleanser is that you have to touch every part of your scalp while you're using it, because there isn't any foaming to help the product move all over your head on its own. I give myself a little mini-massage all over to stimulate blood flow as well as making sure I'm getting every inch of my scalp clean or else I get irritation (hard water + sensitive skin)."

It's only a couple parts per million, your hair will be fine.  The real problem in pools comes from the addition of copper as an algicide.  Copper will turn blond hair green."

NoPoo,37ot88,lunapitanga,3,Fri May 29 05:45:10 2015 UTC,People use BS because it has a high pH so lowering it undermines why you would use it. Besides that BS works as a buffer. So unless you mix it really precise the pH will most likely be 9.5 (BS still acts as a buffer) or 2 when all BS has reacted with lemon juice.
NoPoo,37ot88,Spoetnik1,2,Fri May 29 08:30:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly, as far asb""no poo"" goes a lot of people go with the whole bs/acv thing without thinking about the other ways to not use sulfates. From personal experience, (over 2 years ""no poo"") I would not put bs on my head in anyway anymore. I have been using Co wash for about 3/4 of the  time (water rinses and bs/acv was not very good for me)and it has worked brilliantly for me. Using a conditioner like suave naturals has worked really well for me. My hair is wavy to curly and coarse and thick, just so you know. I have never been happier with my hair. Just my  2 cents."

But I do want to share some links I have been shown during my time here in /r/nopoo.   http://blog.kanelstrand.com/2014/01/baking-soda-destroyed-my-hair.html  This goes into why BS is harmful and also lists alternatives like rye flour shampoo, which the author claims works better than BS.

NoPoo,37ot88,nopooq,1 point,Fri May 29 13:38:15 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't dream of putting a salt like sodium bicarbonate in my hair. Never have.  I use Castile soap, known as shampoo soap around here. It's made with plant fats instead of animal fats and is a bit less alkaline than bar soap (btw, most of the 'bar soap' you buy at the store is actually detergent masquerading as soap).   You need very little soap, just dance it through the hair and really pay attention to washing your scalp. Then you rinse the crap out of it with water and follow with acv 1 Tbsp to a cup of water rinse. I use filtered water in the cup. Let that set there and think about things for a minute and then rinse the crap out it with water.  Then gently press your hair dry with a towel; no rough stuff. Wet hair is fragile. Saloned/styled hair is super fragile.  A few drops of coconut oil on the fingertips and massage your scalp; get every area. Feels great. Now comb into your general style with a wide tooth comb and let it dry to just damp.  If you need more conditioning a drop or two of coconut oil to your finger lengths and palms and gently apply it, from scalp to tip.  Blow dry?  I don't think so."

NoPoo,37i7f6,RatherNotRegister,2,Wed May 27 22:01:48 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of bath gels have silicones, too, as dimethicone is a common skin protectant. Do you have a gym membership? Many gyms have low cost shampoo in the shower for members. If not, is there one nearby where you can get a day pass? Or do you have a friend or roommate whose shampoo you could nab for one shower? Or home to folks' house for dinner and a bath?"

You should be fine to co-wash it out with a quality silicone-free product that has nonionic surfactants which is pretty common in a lot of products.   If you want you can post over in /r/haircarescience and have someone more knowledgeable that me look over the ingredient list but I really don't see anything that would bump Dimethicone up to group 3."

They make bars for all hair types, and offer sample sizes so that you can find the right shampoo for you without spending too much money.  Note that if you have hard water in your area, even mildly hard, you will probably need to use some type of acidic rinse as a conditioner if you use a natural shampoo bar.  1 tbsp apple cider vinegar in 1 cup of water is the most popular option, but you can also use things like diluted lemon juice, or citric acid tablets/powder dissolved in water.

The sidebar of /r/curlyhair has a lot of information about silicone and sulfate-free products. The core reason to go no-poo is to get your hair back to its natural healthy state. Most shampoo and conditioners add silicones (in the conditioner) that makes the hair smoother feeling, but they require sulfates (in the shampoo) to wash out later which is damaging/drying to the hair. Conditioner without silicones won't weigh down your hair or require hard sulfates for cleansing. The /r/curlyhair methods work for any hair type, not just curly."

I tried several things (including rhassoul clay and COwashing) until I found my current regime and it works well:   mix a couple spoonfuls of finely ground rye flour with water, until it is a smooth paste around the same consistency of shampoo. Massage thoroughly into scalp. Rinse well.   I initially followed it up with ACV but I don't think this is necessary as the rye paste has a neutral pH so I plan to omit this step. Another thing which I am trying is mixing the rye flour with oat milk instead of water (boil 1/2C water with 1 Tablespoon oats for 2 minutes, sift to remove oats, allow to cool).  If you can't find finely ground rye flour, use whatever you can get but you may need to sieve the mixture after blending with water.

After a shower, I have a little bottle with some lavender essential oil + water... Shake it up and give the scalp a few sprays, mostly so it didn't smell like scalp.   If I'm feeling particularly dirty, I'll scrub with a few drops of Dr.Bronners (lather in your hands first, then distribute. Doesn't take much)  The bs/acv was so much goddamn work, and made my hair dry  and sad.

NoPoo,37e7ov,toystoriegirl,1 point,Thu May 28 02:06:00 2015 UTC,"/u/misspiggie has it - Scritch and preen were more important when my hair was longer, but I recently cut off a foot and now it's around chin length, so I don't have to try very hard to distribute the oils.    Typically I'll shower after a workout, and just scrub my scalp with my fingers a lot. I think the sweat helps loosen things quite a bit, because it's noticeably cleaner after a post-workout WO wash than a non-sweaty WO wash.   I use warm-to-hot water and scrub my scalp, then do my normal showering, then at the end I rinse with just cold. I do use a hairdryer or straightener most days, because my bed head gets craaaaazy with it so short like this.   Day 2-3 I usually sit and read or watch tv and section out my hair and brush through it with a BBB.   It has NOT felt dry or damaged. After the first month it stopped looking dull and feeling waxy (I think I was using too much castile soap).  I can and do often stick my head under the tap, towel it off, then either pin it back or give it a quick blowdry, and it isn't noticeably greasy or weird.  I should mention though, that before I went no poo I was already a very infrequent shampoo-er, and have really thick hair and no trouble with it being particularly greasy. I did still have to go through some transition: maybe 3-4 weeks before my hair looked normal and another month before it felt smooth and touchable.  Hope that helps!"

NoPoo,37g9jd,parkernaturalcare,2,Wed May 27 12:16:48 2015 UTC,"How often are you washing?  It sounds like you're washing rather often (at least every couple of days), which can make the transition phase last much longer.  Try to go at least 4 days without washing your hair with any type of cleaner (commercial or homemade).  This will help your scalp to calm down and regulate itself.  If possible, don't even wet your hair every day.  You can water-only wash (scrub your scalp under running water) every other day, but otherwise just leave it be aside from a good brushing twice a day with a bristle brush (boar bristle or sisal).  When using your bristle brush, only brush small sections at a time.  Start at the roots of your hair and work your way to the ends.  How long have you been using a natural cleansing method?  As you mentioned, hair can take 2 months to transition.  If you're only a week or two in, you need to be patient!  Yes, the transition phase is greasy and frustrating, but once your scalp calms down it will be much easier to find the right no-poo method for you.  Learn to like braids and ponytails.  If you've already been washing sparingly and brushing regularly, and you're at least a month into your no-poo journey, you might want to consider trying a new method.  A lot of users have good results with shampoo bars.  Chagrin Valley is a popular source, though any sulfate-free shampoo bar will work.  (http://www.chagrinvalleysoapandsalve.com)  Be aware that if you have hard water, you will need to use some form of acidic rinse (diluted ACV, diluted lemon juice, diluted citric acid powder) as a conditioner.  Let the rinse sit in your hair for several minutes before rinsing it out."

NoPoo,37g9jd,RatherNotRegister,1 point,Wed May 27 16:03:46 2015 UTC,"You have to remember that not every recipe will work for every hair/skin combo.  I'd never seen this recipe before, but my first thought was that it has a lot of ingredients, including a fair amount of oils. Soap nuts are a very mild cleanser, and I wonder if they're having to battle their own recipe so much that there's nothing left to clean your hair with.  My recommendation is to wash your hair with a gentle sulfate shampoo to make sure all the old silicone and products are out of it, then switch to a less complex no-poo system, like rye flour. I know Skinchanted has a soap nuts shampoo that folks like, too, though I've never tried it.

If you try co-washing, I know Trader Joe's has a natural tea tree conditioner that works well, and that might help with dandruff."
NoPoo,378jts,purple_cats,1 point,Tue May 26 06:08:51 2015 UTC,"-1. Drink more water.    Explanation: Dehydration worsens dandruff.   -2. If you must use shampoo, use one that does not contain sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, or similar named ingredients.  There are non-detergent shampoo brands, for example Trader Joe's brand shampoos didn't have it last time I checked.   Shampoo explanation: Most shampoos contain strong detergents that strip all the oil from your scalp and dry it out. These are the same detergents used in dish soap and laundry soap and can cause skin irritation with extended use. SLS make a foam that looks like you would expect in a commercial, but they're not necessarily the best thing for rubbing on your skin. I also don't use toothpaste that has SLS in it. The foam isn't necessary.   -3. Buy coconut oil. Use your fingers to work it into your scalp. Leave it in for an hour at minimum, or ideally overnight. Might want to put a towel on your pillowcase. In the morning, wash it out with conditioner. Lather the conditioner like you would shampoo, rinse it out WELL, and REPEAT. You must do it 2x to get all the oil out, and rinse it very well or your hair will be left greasy. The best conditioners to do this are the light cheap ones - V05 or Suave - I wouldn't recommend any other brands, V05 is really the best.   Coconut oil explanation: Your scalp is stripped of oils by shampoo and is freaking out with dandruff. Rubbing in the oil with your finger tips will dissolve all the dead skin, and the conditioner will rinse it out (like dissolves like). Your scalp will be left with a normal amount of oil from the coconut oil, and will stop freaking out about its oil balance.   -4. Buy white vinegar. Dilute it 1/10 with water in a plastic cup. When you take a shower, at the end of the shower when you're done washing, dump the cup over your hair and let it soak for a few minutes. You may feel a sting as the vinegar touches your scalp, this means your scalp is cracked but the vinegar isn't hurting it, it's actually going to be better after this treatment. If it stings you're definitely in a condition that you need vinegar.   Vinegar explanation: Your scalp should be a slightly acidic pH and a lot of hair care products disrupt this pH balance which causes dandruff and growth of the wrong microbiomes on your scalp. Dilute vinegar is a time-tested solution that will correct your scalp pH.  Side note: Since your hair shaft is also supposed to be a slightly acidic pH, rinsing with vinegar will balance the pH of the hair shaft and smooth down its cuticles, making the hair noticeably softer once dried. Basically it produces the effect you would expect of conditioner."

Thanks everyone :-)  PS: for any of you out there with the fun colored hair like me (Pravana, Manic Panic, Ion, etc) I seriously suggest you change to the 'no poo' method. It keeps your hair color intact and looking amazing for weeks and weeks. My blue hair does not fade at all and has looked fabulous for over seven weeks...no joke!"

NoPoo,3746kn,CasualHandStuff,1 point,Tue May 26 23:27:51 2015 UTC,"Spoiler Alert - A lot of ladies have sleek and shiny hair because of the products they use (shampoo, conditioner, various hair serums and styling products) and the styling itself (blow drying, straightening, curling, brushing).  While their hair may look super shiny, it's not necessarily HEALTHY hair.  I'm a lady with long, dark, straight hair and I've found that, since switching to no-poo a year ago, my hair is less shiny.  However it's also softer, fluffier, and growing-in thicker.  I've discovered that a lot of the shine in my hair was actually silicone from my conditioner, and not natural healthiness.  That being said, you may be experiencing additional greasiness because of your age.  (Puberty is awesome!)  My hair and skin were incredibly oily till my early 20's, and I definitely had to take additional steps to combat that oil.  You may need to use some type of rinse or wash once or twice a week along with your water-only washing.  Something as simple as a honey wash, an egg wash, or a diluted vinegar rinse may help to give you the cleaner hair you're looking for.  Using a shampoo bar and rinsing with diluted vinegar once a week may also help.  (There are plenty of neutral-smelling shampoo bars available if you're worried about smelling ""girly"".)"
NoPoo,374dux,ronniejean1,2,Sun May 24 19:42:32 2015 UTC,"Have you tried a water and baking soda paste? I find it cleans my hair so I get that shampoo ""squeaky"" feeling, as long as I wash it out completely. And then I apply apple cider vinegar to the ends of my hair as a kind of conditioner. It works better than just water for me."
NoPoo,374dux,marshall_law94,1 point,Sun May 24 20:00:35 2015 UTC,I have not. The baking soda doesn't dry out your hair?

Try an egg wash once a week or so: two egg yolks (pull off the little umbilical cord if you can), tablespoon of honey, a few drops of olive oil well mixed together. Rub it into your hair vigorously during a shower, let it sit for 2-3 minutes while you do the rest of your wash routine, and rinse with cold water.  Results will amaze you."

NoPoo,374dux,introvrt2themax,2,Wed Jun 10 07:31:54 2015 UTC,I actually use a vinegar rinse (1 tablespoon apple cider or white vinegar to 8 oz water) once a week - I was able to go two weeks this time - and then water only the rest of the time.  I skip the baking soda since I've read several threads and online blogs stating it can be too harsh for many people's heads over the long haul.  Although it has also been said that the baking soda/vinegar rinse combo can be really great in the beginning to clarify your hair before going completely no-poo.  Everyone's hair and water situation is different so it may take a bit to figure out the best routine for your hair.

NoPoo,374dux,kelev,2,Sun May 24 20:52:56 2015 UTC,"I don't use anything on the ends since I have pretty short hair (longish pixie), but if the ends are always dry you might want to look at using a touch of conditioner on the ends.  I understand the curly-haired crowd generally has good luck with conditioner-only (CO) washes vs water only.  Just watch out for the ingredients (cones, etc.).  Make sure to read all the stuff in the sidebar - there should be some stuff on clarifying to get started.  Hope this helps. :)"

It snowstorms if I brush my hair but if I lift the hair up and look through it it doesn't seem toooo bad.  I used baking soda to get the coconut oil out so I'm wondering if that caused it to just dry out so much. I will put more coconut oil on tonight then tomorrow I will wash it out with baking soda and condition with apple vinegar and see what happens.

I don't want to wash it out this time as I am worried it is the baking soda that dried me out and cause the dandruff to return.  It is hard to see how it's going now. It looks better but maybe the oil is just sticking all the dandruff down to my scalp? I will wait for the oil to disappear naturally/get soaked up, then see what the situation is.

NoPoo,36ubk9,amr8972,3,Fri May 22 05:54:01 2015 UTC,"FWIW, I stopped using shampoo about 6 months ago, but when my girlfriend mentioned my hair was starting to smell bad (especially after working out), I started looking into shampoo bars and silicone-free conditioners.  I've had great luck with J.R. Liggett's shampoo bars (I'm partial to the one with argan oil, although my girlfriend likes the one with peppermint and jojoba), and I recently started using Burt's Bees conditioner (I'm using the one that has grapefruit and I believe Shea butter). I only use it maybe 2-3 times a week depending on how much I've been sweating, and go either water-only or completely dry every other day, just using a BBB and skritching on those days. My hair has never looked and felt better.  Also, I got a friend who's been no poo for about 2 years into those shampoo bars as well; he likes the tea tree oil one the best. They're really cheap (Google them and you can find them as low as $2.50 if I remember right) so maybe give those a try."

Exfoliates your scalp and gets rid of dandruff, and spreads oil from your scalp all along the shaft of your hair.  Any will do, as long as it uses 100% natural fibers, no plastic.

NoPoo,36q7fa,llomas01,1 point,Sun May 24 07:01:16 2015 UTC,"Dunno what to say, this hasn't been a problem for me.  What works for me is to brush my hair in every direction, use lots of pressure, etc...  You could try a different style of boar brush, some of them have a coarser pattern with less bristles, meaning it'll reach to your scalp more easily. Some of them have a few plastic/nylon barbs included so it separates your hair more thoroughly.  Maybe try an egg wash."
NoPoo,36q7fa,SobrietySchmobriety,1 point,Sun May 24 07:32:44 2015 UTC,"Have you been scritching your scalp? The flakes are probably just build up. You need to spend some time (like when you're reading stuff online) rubbing your scalp with the pads of your fingers (like when you wash it). This will break up your build up so it can be washed away without harsher ingredients. Spend like 20 minutes doing that before washing, since you probably have a lot of build up.  As for the dryness, I have never consistently used water only, so I haven't experienced that. Maybe try using a silicone-free conditioner at least some of the time. Tresemmé Naturals is one that people here mention using a lot, plus it's cheap and available in grocery stores. I used to co-wash with it, but it over-moisturizes my hair type (straight and fine)."

NoPoo,36etw5,PerryLJackson,3,Mon May 18 20:56:16 2015 UTC,"Are you applying the essential oil directly to your hair, or are you using a carrier oil?  Essential oils should never be applied directly to the hair or scalp, as they can cause irritation.  Essential oils are best applied either diluted in a carrier oil like almond or jojoba oil, or diluted in another solution like an ACV rinse.  If you're using a carrier oil, you simply mix a small amount of the essential oil with the carrier oil (you can find the ratios online), and then apply the mixture to your scalp via an eyedropper or similar device.  Work the oil mixture over your entire scalp, let it sit for 30 minutes, and then work the oil through the rest of your hair.  Put your hair up (a bun works well for this) for a few more hours or the rest of the day, and then wash the oil out with your usual cleansing method.  If you do it this way, you should only have to apply the oil every time you cleanse your hair (1-2 times per week).  Note that not all no-poo cleansing methods remove oil from hair.  Most people add the tea tree oil to their cleansing solutions (baking soda, acv, castile soap, honey wash, etc.)  I recommend no more than 10 drops per cup of water, though 5-8 is probably best.  The cleansing solution (or solutions, if you're using a cleanser and a conditioner) are applied and rinsed as normal.  Use your cleansers on your regular no-poo schedule (1-2 times per week seems to be common) and see how your scalp does.  (Make sure you're working your cleaning solution into your scalp when you wash!)  If you start experiencing flakes again, try the below suggestion.  If you're water-only, or if you're still experiencing flakes with infusing your cleansing products, you can infuse a water rinse with tea tree oil.  Add 5-10 drops of oil to a cup of water, and put the infused water in a squeeze or spray bottle.  After you shower and WO wash, apply the mixture to your scalp and work it thoroughly in with your fingertips.  Squeeze the excess liquid out of your hair, and then dry and style as normal.  This process can theoretically be repeated every day, or every time you shower, though daily used of any essential oil CAN cause some irritation of your scalp if you're particularly sensitive."

NoPoo,36db1t,CovertMonkey,5,Mon May 18 19:50:44 2015 UTC,"Why did you start so dramatically?  When I started, it was a very gradual transition. Over the course of several months I shampooed both less frequently and with less shampoo. Towards the end I was only using a pinch of shampoo once a week.  Your hair is still expecting full shampoo treatment daily. Your transition may take longer because of it, but will eventually settle. Best of luck"
NoPoo,36db1t,SunshineCat,5,Mon May 18 15:59:45 2015 UTC,"Because it's in my nature to just go big or go home, and I don't have patience when it comes to waiting."

NoPoo,36db1t,buick_makane,5,Thu May 21 01:56:01 2015 UTC,"Sounds like true dandruff, not just dry skin --- so, a fungal infection in your scalps yeast. Go see a dermatologist for official diagnosis and probably a medicated shampoo.  You can try again on gentler methods after you get your medical issue (because that's what this is!) sorted out!!!!"

NoPoo,36dth5,LawfulKitten,3,Mon May 18 16:26:44 2015 UTC,"Potassium metabisulphite is different from the sulfates in detergents and shampoos.  It's used as a preservative in food products, and while it can theoretically cause irritation if you are particularly sensitive, the small amount added to lemon juice (and the even smaller amount that would be in a lemon rinse) shouldn't be enough to affect your hair.  You're going to be hard-pressed to find lemon juice without preservatives in it.  Your only options would be to squeeze your own (expensive and time-consuming), or to find juice that's organic and chemical free.  This juice will be much more expensive, and will not last as long in your fridge so you may end-up wasting a lot.  I personally wouldn't worry about it.  Provided that you're not allergic to potassium metabisulphite (put a few drops on your skin and check for irritation), you shouldn't have any issues using lemon juice containing it."

NoPoo,36c8ae,ammolite,1 point,Tue May 19 05:39:59 2015 UTC,"Do you scritch-and-preen regularly?  Do your use a BBB, and do you only brush small sections of hair at a time when your use it?  These steps help to distribute all of that oily stuff from your roots to the drier ends of your hair.  You can get a decent BBB at stores like Target or Walmart for under $10, or you get buy a good one online for about $20.  Scritching and preening is 100% free (aside from the time spent doing it), so it might be a good place to start.  Have your considered co-washing (washing with a silicone-free conditioner)?  There are some really inexpensive silicone free conditioners like the Suave Naturals line (they're usually under $3 a bottle at the drugstore).  Simply use the conditioner like your would a shampoo, and scrub your hair root-to-tip.  Doing so once a week and WO washing in-between may help to keep your scalp cleaner and keep your hair more moisturized.  There are a lot of good ""pantry item"" recipes throughout this sub and on the sidebar.  Rye flour in particular is a cost-effective option as normal rye flour is fairly inexpensive (you don't need to buy the all-organic expensive variety), and you get a lot of it for the price.  You only need to use a small amount of flour per wash, and you only wash once a week, so one bag of flour will last you months.  Other options like an egg-wash once a week are also easy on the wallet."
NoPoo,36c8ae,Starlightbumfluff,1 point,Tue May 19 16:10:38 2015 UTC,Try doing an ACV wash without any BS. The slight acidity is close to the levels on the skin. I find this helps for me between BS/ACV washes when my hair is getting itchy.

NoPoo,361uzl,Starlightbumfluff,2,Fri May 15 11:54:38 2015 UTC,"If it burned, you'll probably have some angry skin. Keep an eye on the condition of your scalp, and try not to stress. Maybe consider using a sulfate free, natural shampoo bar instead of BS/ACV."

Must just be my scalp. Thanks heaps!"
NoPoo,361uzl,dreams_or_reality,1 point,Fri May 15 20:39:18 2015 UTC,"I definitely recommend stopping the BS, this is not good for your hair or scalp anyway and once a week is too often. If you want to keep using something instead of going water only then try a sulphate free shampoo or maybe conditioner only"
NoPoo,361uzl,TheShotgunBetty,1 point,Fri May 15 19:26:30 2015 UTC,"Baking soda is too harsh for scalp, it strips and dries it severely.  Because you have been using it so long you finally completely stripped it to the point of actual damage.  If you continue baking soda with your scalp in this condition you will develop sores on your scalp that will form scabs.  Eek!  Also, sodium bicarbonate denatures the proteins of your hair.  Your hair is composed almost entirely of amino acid chains (proteins) and baking soda comes in and breaks those chains.  The broken chains feel slippery to the touch so many get the impression their hair is getting ""soft"" and continue using it until the severe hair or scalp damage occurs like in your case.  Just simply cut out baking soda.  An alternative is rye flour, it has a neutral pH and won't destroy your scalp and hair."
NoPoo,3605tu,dingweasel,2,Thu May 14 23:50:21 2015 UTC,"The hard fact is that everyone is different. I'm myself an incidental nopoo. I just decided to try not using it anymore. What I've gathered is the best course for a starter is to gauge their own scalp health as they go. Cool water and not hot is best to prevent washing away oils. Their are also nopoo friendly shampoos, which I find interesting, because it shows that the harsh chemicals of popular shampoos don't have to exist. I'm sure there are better advisors here than myself.    Just wanted to start off with what little I know. I used to have a itchy, itchy scalp. Now it is fairly dry. The only issue I have is a thick greasy on my forehead, around my ears and down my neck and back. I can't figure out myself why it is like that, but it isn't noticeable unless i shower long enough for water to soften it and it can be scraped off thickly with my nails. That is my issue of course.     Congrats, I assume you kicked cancer in the taint. ~_^"

NoPoo,360pt0,derebi,2,Fri May 15 02:50:27 2015 UTC,Are you water only? What is your hair like?   If it were my scalp I would try honey washes as they are both clarifying and moisturising.
NoPoo,360pt0,queenblackacid,2,Fri May 15 13:59:31 2015 UTC,"I've tried water only, but it makes more dandruff appear, and I guess its clogging up my hairs and making it worse :/ I'll plan on going to a dermatologist and see if there's something else"
NoPoo,360pt0,queenblackacid,2,Fri May 15 23:50:23 2015 UTC,"I wonder if it is not really dandruff, but sebum. They look very similar."
NoPoo,360pt0,ammolite,2,Sat May 16 01:44:14 2015 UTC,"Did the dandruff start before or after you began your no-poo routine?    If it started before, have you ever been to a doctor or a dermatologist?  There's a chance that you may have some form of dermatitis that needs to be treated/controlled before you start a no-poo routine.  While there are natural ways to control some forms of dermatitis, it can vary from form to form.  Thus, it's best to get a doctor's opinion before starting any treatment (natural or medicinal).  Additionally, your doctor may be able to identify if you have any sensitivities or allergies that may be causing the flaking and irritation of your scalp.  There's always the chance that you're using a product (either commercial or no-poo) that you have a sensitivity to."
NoPoo,360pt0,Bchbnd,1 point,Fri May 15 17:02:14 2015 UTC,"Maybe I should go to a dermatologist. And yea the dandruff is still there, shampoo or nopoo, but It gets worse with shampoo I guess. However, don't think that I've got ""flakes"" Its kinda like dough... In a way. I can gather it under my nails, so you can see my frustration. I don't know if theres a term for that, either way, I'll see a dermatologist. Thanks for the advice."
NoPoo,35xgz2,Diecianni,3,Thu May 14 09:40:22 2015 UTC,"This conditioner contains paraffinum liquidum (mineral oil) which can cause build up and is actually on the ""avoid"" list you linked (under waxes and non-natural oils).  In terms of lathering I find it's helpful to mix the conditioner with water before applying it. I wrote a post about it here if you want more details."
NoPoo,35xgz2,justcallmedoge,1 point,Thu May 14 12:16:30 2015 UTC,"Hmm. In theory it seems okay - no silicones.   But, its third ingredient is a preservative.  It also contains mineral oil, which can only be removed with shampoo. I wouldn't use it.  I'd suggest, from my experience, (3+ years, long thick hair) that you try the BS/ACV regimen until your sebum production ramps down.  I'm currently cowashing with Melrose Botanicals conditioner base mixed with honey. I wash once a week and don't wet my hair at any other time.  I have found the same problem as you regarding knowing whether the conditioner is distributed thoroughly, but I use more to compensate. My conditioner costs $8 AUD for a litre, from a health food store."

NoPoo,35toie,sparrow5,8,Wed May 13 17:47:57 2015 UTC,"I always heard it was the other way, around.... That being in love can override this (which is why sometimes things sizzle out after the honeymoon period), but if you want a mate for life, that their stinkiest should still be somewhat appealing to you, or else you will fight all the time and subconsciously be resentful of them. And that when their scent is good it can drive you over the edge into passionate bonded loyalty.   Also heard that hormonal birth control can seriously affect your ability to discern the smells of potential partners. But there's a specific study for this one, other pheromone research is mostly either within botany or sociology... Haven't seen the organic chemists taking up the cause on this in humans, so someone please point me towards such research if it exists."

I ended up trying nearly every method in the sub over the course of about six or eight months... and while I felt I could go out in public, it was never good. I had the most success with baking soda and vinegar, but as soon as I felt like I'd finally figured this whole thing out, I read that was potentially damaging. Well.  Water Only just never felt clean. I preened, I scritched, I brushed with a Denman Boar Bristle. I frequently reevaluated my approach. I read every guide and watched every video. The amount of information and misinformation and conflicting information was staggering and I felt very discouraged.  I finally gave up, but I still wanted to do right by my hair and the environment, so I picked up a shampoo bar. Holy cow, the difference was amazing. My hair felt incredibly clean and light and I experienced all the positives at long last. A week between washing, hair that was easy to style and manageable, no more itchy scalp, no more flakes. The bar did give me a very ""squeaky clean"" feeling that was uncomfortable right after rinsing, so I have to be sure to carefully condition afterward (I use either apple cider vinegar or Tresemme Naturals silicone free conditioner, which is very cheap and readily available in retail stores). I'm STILL whittling away at the very first shampoo bar I purchased... thing lasts forever.  I also found I had missed the feeling of a bit of suds, and the vegetable based and detergent free shampoo bars DO lather up without disturbing your natural oils. Win-win.  Hope this helps."

NoPoo,35s5qx,Malassah,1 point,Thu May 14 19:45:06 2015 UTC,"Do you have hard water in your area?  If you have hard water (even mildly hard), going WO may be much more difficult.  While you can get a shower head filter, or use bottled distilled water to rinse your hair, this can be a hassle.  Mind you, some people just can't go WO.  There seems to be a misconception on this sub that it's something achievable by everyone, and it's not. Whether you're being foiled by your own body chemistry, or by the quality of the water in your area, WO is a goal that not everyone can reach.  Don't feel bad about this!  BBBs tend to work better for people with straight hair.  I've seen some people recommend that those with wavy and curly hair brush or comb LESS with no-poo.  I can't vouch whether or not this works (I have straight hair), but it may be worth a shot for you.  Have you tried conditioner-only washing?  It sounds like, with your hair type, you might be a good candidate for the ""curly-girl"" method which is essentially conditioner-washing with a silicone-free conditioner.  I like Yes to Carrots, but there are a few good brands of silicone-free conditioners on the market (Suave Naturals is particularly inexpensive, if you want a good starting point).  You wash your hair root-to-tip with the conditioner (as your would shampoo), let it sit for a few minutes, and then rinse it out.  Some people find that only partially rinsing the conditioner helps to keep their hair moisturized, while others find that they need to completely rinse their hair to prevent greasiness.  You'd have to experiment with the method.  If CO-washing isn't for you, there are quite a few other washes, rinses, and ""low-poo"" shampoos and soaps available.  Natural rinses like rye flour, honey, or clay are popular.  There's a link to a honey wash on the sidebar, and a link to a clay wash.  I've also seen people here swear by egg washes, avocado masks, and other washes and rinses using pantry ingredients.  For low-poo options, shampoo bars are popular.  Chagrin valley shampoo bars are quite popular, and I know people who swear by them (http://www.chagrinvalleysoapandsalve.com).  You can also use various other shampoo bars.  Liquid castile soap (like Dr. Bronner's) can be mixed with water and other optional ingredients to make a simple shampoo.  With any of these options, you may need an acidic rinse as a conditioner after washing.  (Ex: diluted ACV, lemon juice, citric acid powder, etc.)  This will help prevent build-up cause by the minerals in tap water.  There are sulfate-free shampoos available.  I've seen a lot of people saying good things about Nature's Gate products.  While these shampoos are more expensive than traditional commercial products, you use them less frequently (1-3 times per week) so the cost evens out.  They can be used alone, with a homemade conditioner, or with a silicone-free conditioner."

If you have oily hair, you're going to need different ingredients than someone with dry hair.  My suggestion would be to read the bar descriptions and order a few different samples of bars that sound good for your needs.  The site has a ""help me choose"" tab along the top.  Clicking it may help in choosing the best product for your hair."

I also use the mask when my hair starts to feel dry. I don't use heat often, so it cones out to one every 6 weeks I think. Y2C conditioner is sufficient to pull the oil out if you have trouble with that.  You can get a decent BBB on Amazon; mine is a denman I got for $25.  Honestly with as fried as your hair is/mine was I personally wouldn't forgo conditioner for now. Bleaching is really tough on it."

NoPoo,35pvug,Captain_Canada_Eh,1 point,Wed May 13 07:47:16 2015 UTC,It may not be dandruff. It may me solidified sebum collecting on your scalp. This was very normal for me in the first five or so months. I've noticed I still get the flakiness if I wait too long between scritching or using a hard boar bristle brush. I've been no poo for over 5 years.   EDIT: I'd recommend scritching your scalp for a good twenty minutes (I watch tv while doing this) then hopping in the shower for a lengthy rinse. Use a blow dryer on the scalp to make sure you've gotten everything out.

NoPoo,35ji2o,aunt_marge,7,Sun May 10 23:48:34 2015 UTC,"Hello !  I have been water only for a long while (years now I think). I too LOVE cold showers and find that they are for sure compatible with water only, so long as you take your time ""scritching and preening"", just the same as a warm water shower. One other tip i have is to clean all your combs and brushes often, and brush your hair thoroughly pre-shower !"

NoPoo,35hojz,byebyebitchez,4,Sun May 10 13:56:36 2015 UTC,"If your scalp is really that itchy it might be a good idea to see a dermatologist just in case. Otherwise I would recommend completely cutting out products for a while as something you're using may be irritating to you. Use a boar bristle brush and just wash with water (warm but not hot). Don't use bleach, baking soda or anything acidic and try to stop heat treatments like blow drying out straightening and try not to scratch, that will make it worse."
NoPoo,35hojz,dreams_or_reality,1 point,Sun May 10 15:02:38 2015 UTC,Its so hard not to scratch!!! Thanks for the information !
NoPoo,35hojz,eraser-dust,3,Mon May 11 01:46:13 2015 UTC,"I agree with the other poster.  It sounds like you might have something called seborrheic dermatitis which requires proper treatment and diagnosis from a dermatologist.  You may need to use something like Nizoral for a while to get it under control, unfortunately.  There's a sulfate-free version by a different name if you are afraid of sulfates or just don't like to use them.    Henna is a bit of a paradox because it can make the hair seems super soft and shiney, but later down the road it can mess with your hair texture and make it incredibly dry.  If you really want to get your hair under control, you need to stop chemically treating it for a while and stop with the henna and indigo as well.    After your hair and scalp have had time to recover and symptoms reside, you might want to look into cowashing or something similar.  You can find pretty great natural conditioners that work wonderfully while keeping your hair healthy.    I've been in the same exact place you are now which is why I'm saying all of this.  Nothing worked until I used something to treat my scalp properly and now my hair is recovering."
NoPoo,35hojz,hurrdresser,2,Sun May 10 18:54:54 2015 UTC,Thank you for all the information!!
NoPoo,35hojz,aggravatingyou,1 point,Mon May 11 01:44:55 2015 UTC,"I agree with both other comments, see a dermatologist, and the comment about henna eventually messing with porosity is also true. I would add that I get flakes and itchiness from time to time, and I've used SheaMoisture's African Black Soap line and it was a good solution, all while smelling delicious, like bananas foster. I have a couple of clients with psoriasis that use it, too. If the dermatologist doesn't pan out, you may give it a shot."
NoPoo,35al48,iseealice,2,Fri May 8 14:28:43 2015 UTC,"Hey! First things first, your hair will always, always, always have split ends. A haircut doesn't clear every split end. Your shampoo/conditioner is probably your main problem though.  I have fine, oily hair at the roots, but very very dry ends that easily become brittle. To help with this I found a natural/vegan shampoo. There is a brand I really like called Acure. (http://www.acureorganics.com/product-p/1000.htm) It has a little bit of a licorice smell while washing, but doesn't linger too long. This shampoo has been great. My roots are less oily, and my ends are much healthier. It seems to have removed the buildup from my old shampoo that gathered around my scalp, and the super good for your hair ingedients helped manage my ends.   Also, to help your ends, once a week dip them in coconut oil, tie in a low ponytail and wear a shirt you don't care about. Let it sit for 15-20 minutes, then rinse out with hot water, no shampoo or conditioner.  To summarize,  Wash with natural shampoo as needed. Probably 3 times per week once your hair adjusts.  Use coconut oil treatment once per week for ends."
NoPoo,35al48,littlemissslaughter,2,Sun May 10 23:11:47 2015 UTC,If hair is cut with scissors that aren't sharp enough it damages the hair as it is cut and causes it to split. Make sure the right scissors are used and that they are sharp.
NoPoo,35al48,MalavethMorningrise,1 point,Fri May 8 16:05:28 2015 UTC,You shouldn't wash your hair everyday also use cold water

NoPoo,35al48,ramalamamama,1 point,Sat May 9 07:51:27 2015 UTC,It dries your hair out and strips the natural oils from your hair which are good for it.
NoPoo,358hfh,Malassah,3,Fri May 8 00:00:00 2015 UTC,"I would recommend trying co-wash. I was doing water only but I was having the same trouble after a bit, I started co-washing and now my hair is lovely. Also, how often are you washing your hair? Has it been daily? I would try to cut back on how often you wash your hair since having a little more sebum build up may help you get a brush through better. Are you using a boar bristle brush and scritching & preening? That will aid you in washing less by distributing the oils in your hair. I can't comment on BS & ACV because I won't use them due to sensitive skin, so I don't know if you should stop that or not."
NoPoo,358hfh,theladydisarray,2,Fri May 8 00:48:25 2015 UTC,I just found a boat bristle brush in my house today. So I'm going to start using it. How often should I be brushing? And as soon as I find out was scritching and preening is I will start! I was considering checking out aveda conditioner to see if I can use that. I read a lot of people use natures gate but I don't seem to have that in Canada. Did you ever get away from the conditioner and go WO?
NoPoo,358hfh,theladydisarray,2,Fri May 8 05:36:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know what the standard is, but I brush it with the BBB every night before bed. I section my hair and slowly pull the brush though to distribute the oil on my head.  Scritching is basically giving yourself a head massage to loosen the sebum that's built up on your head. You take your fingertips and sort of...I dunno, run them around sort of like you're scratching your head. I'm sure there are videos on youtube for clarification, lol. Preening is separating out a section of hair and taking it between your index and middle fingers, and running the fingers from your roots towards the ends. Longer hair, this isn't as effective, but it's also supposed to help with oil distribution.  I honestly don't have recommendations on conditioners, I use Veganese from LUSH because it's lightweight and smells wonderful, plus it's not full of chemicals. It's a bit pricey, but I won't use anything else.  You could potentially go WO, a lot of people do WO, but some people, their hair just isn't suited for WO.  To co-wash, make sure you use the conditioner as if it's shampoo. Scrub it around on your head like you would if it were shampoo. This is also how you should be WO washing. Whether it's conditioner or WO, you have to make sure to massage your head and rub around whatever it is on your scalp. It's more the physical agitation that cleans it than just running water through it."

NoPoo,358hfh,fairyrebel,3,Fri May 8 14:20:15 2015 UTC,"Don't brush when it's wet! It's much more fragile when wet.   Also, try a teensy tiny bit of olive oil in the length (no where near your scalp). It protects the strands from getting too much water soaked in through the top layer of cuticle. I read about that on Sciency Hair Blog and it's worked really well for me."

NoPoo,358hfh,fairyrebel,1 point,Fri May 8 05:24:03 2015 UTC,I ranted a bit in another comment about why I don't use coconut oil. Will you elaborate a bit on how you use it? I could never get it out of my hair.
NoPoo,358hfh,lannawho,1 point,Fri May 8 13:48:56 2015 UTC,"My hair is curly so I can use a bit more than some people and it's not a problem, but I will apply it like lotion to my hands and elbows and then rub the last 2/3 of the length of my hair with the residue still left on my hands. I usually do this when it's still sopping wet so it gets distributed evenly. I find that rubbing it into my skin first tends to heat it up and eliminate chunks you get if you try to just use it straight from the jar, and that's how I make sure I don't apply too much.  I find that using olive oil worked okay for me but my hair started to smell like rancid oil very quickly and I've never had that problem with the coconut oil.  Everyone is different though, I've tried almond, olive, argan, macadamia, jojoba, and a few other oils and coconut tends to give me the best results."
NoPoo,358hfh,lannawho,1 point,Fri May 8 23:46:49 2015 UTC,Do you put the oil on when you have it wet? Do you rinse it out? Sorry if my questions are dumb!
NoPoo,358hfh,aceetone,1 point,Fri May 8 05:37:58 2015 UTC,"I cowash every three or four days. Also came from WO.  Don't try to brush your hair when it's wet, you're gonna have a bad time. Instead, buy/look for a wide-toothed comb and go through your before you shower. I apply coconut oil about halfway down my hair to the roots. I wait until my hair is dry before I comb it."
NoPoo,358hfh,frecklesandgegs,1 point,Fri May 8 08:57:07 2015 UTC,"These aren't dumb questions!   I put the oil on my hair before I get in the shower and I do rinse it out. I wash my hands with soap before touching my hair in the shower, though, to keep from getting too much oil near my scalp.   There have been a couple recommendations for coconut oil. Since you have such thin hair, I'm still gonna place my bet on olive oil working better for you. I have very long 2a hair, and coconut oil would never never leave me be. I would put the tiniest bit in and for weeks it wouldn't rinse all the way out. Once I even resorted to using a bit of shampoo. It was horrible. Try it if you need a really deep conditioning and have plans of how to remove it, but I don't mess with that anymore.   Also people will make a point about coconut oil smelling good. It only smells good for the first day. After that, it smells rancid. Olive oil, on the other hand, never smells great. But it rinses out well before it starts to smell bad."
NoPoo,358hfh,Darjaille,1 point,Fri May 8 13:48:01 2015 UTC,do you use a certain amount of olive oil (extra virgin or just regular?)? Thank you so much for taking the time to answer my questions! :)
NoPoo,358hfh,ashleyisachild,1 point,Fri May 8 14:18:21 2015 UTC,"I just use a couple drops. I rub it across my hands first to prevent putting too much in one spot. Idk if virgin/extra virgin matters.   To give some perspective, I've used about half an ounce of olive oil in three months. So I should use about two ounces in a year. It's a very small amount."

Basically you keep the fiber in your hair for a couple of days right ? Don't you feel itchy ? Or as the fiber built up in your hair for 2-3 days, does your hair look more dirty/oily ?  I'm interested to have your inputs. Thanks"
NoPoo,352w86,MrBlister4U,2,Thu May 7 09:32:37 2015 UTC,"I used fiber before I did NoPoo and noticed that I had to use significantly more product to get the style I wanted.    Basically you keep the fiber in your hair for a couple of days right ?    Right. I apply fiber on the day that my hair gets cleaned in a WO shower. The few days after that where my hair doesn't get wet in the shower I do not apply product (the first 2 pictures are the results).    Don't you feel itchy ?   I don't. I can't say this would apply to everyone, though.    Or as the fiber built up in your hair for 2-3 days, does your hair look more dirty/oily ?   Again, you can see the results in the first two pictures. I don't think it looks or feels dirty/oily, in fact, a lot of people actually compliment my hair. My method of NoPoo won't work for everyone. It's worth trying, and if it doesn't work, find out what small things need to be changed along the way to make it work."

As for drying I only towel dry. I'll brush it, towel dry it, brush it, towel dry it until it's too the point where it's still slightly wet. Then I apply a little product. Maybe try it without using the blow dryer since that makes my hair frizzle, too."

NoPoo,3516e4,morpen,12,Wed May 6 12:38:27 2015 UTC,ACV = Apple Cider Vinegar wash.   Basically you use baking soda as a shampoo and apple Cider vinegar as a conditioner.   WO = Water only. Rinsing your hair out with nothing but water.   BBB = boar bristle brush. A very fine hairbrush that helps to combat grease.

NoPoo,350yhp,Timmyj01,2,Wed May 6 05:38:01 2015 UTC,I usually do it twice a week but at first you may want to do it more.  Don't get it in your eyes.  You've never felt pain like that before and make sure you rinse it out well to get rid of the smell.  Despite these things it's worth it.  It'll make your hair feel so nice.
NoPoo,350yhp,lovecraftians_unite,1 point,Fri May 8 21:07:59 2015 UTC,"The Neutrogena shampoo is GR8 if you actually have dandruff, as opposed to a dry scalp. The dandruff shampoos you've been using would have caused a lot of damage if you don't have dandruff though, which may or may not be your problem. The ACV wash and tea tree oil are quite wondrous as well (not in the olfactory sense). If you do the ACV, make sure it's organic--I tried to start with generic walmart and it dried my hair out and made my roots heavy/greasy/oily--just overall disgusting. As for the tea tree oil, 2-3 drops is usually enough for one shampoo bottle. Using more than that can also mess your stuff up. Oh! Never apply it directly. Ever. Dilute it with water or a carrier oil or something, you know, whatever floats your boat. I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors!"
NoPoo,34zmlo,Georgerobbo,5,Tue May 5 21:48:05 2015 UTC,"I have lots and lots of hair (hip length and very thick) and I actually slowly increased the length of time between shampoos for almost a year before going real ""nopoo"". What I would recommend is finding a dry shampoo that works for you (I like cornstarch and cocoa powder) and use that on your roots to absorb some of the oils so you can go longer between washing. Start by washing on Monday, dry shampooing on Tuesday, and so on, for about a month. Then you could shampoo Monday, water wash Tuesday, dry shampoo Wednesday, ect. Of course, every scalp is different, but Baking Soda and Apple Cider Vinegar made a good shampoo substitute for me. After about 8 months with no shampoo, I only use my dry shampoo and water to clean my hair and make it look ""shampoo fresh"". Good luck, and feel free to PM me if you have questions!"

The point of me saying this is that everyone's hair and skin are different, and it takes trial and error to find what works for you.

I have waivy/curled hair and I was in no-poo for 5 months, only rinsing it with water. After a month of really greasy hair it really got better and I felt the curls were more defined than when I used shampoo. But after a while I noticed these white particles on my scalp that made me really uncomfortable. I never had dandruff so I thought ""maybe it's dirt!"". I started combing my hair in the shower every other day but it didn't help. So I bought natural shampoo (that produced no foam) and conditioner but it didn't help. So I finally decided to try regular shampoo and conditioner again, after 5 months of using only water! And pufff, the particle amount was drastically reduced (I don't think they are there anymore, after a week of regular shampoo usage) and my hair it's brighter and smoother. So yeah, I really have no advices, I just wanted you to know that you are not alone in the search for the best method :)"

I subscribe to this to learn basics, but I wouldn't know where or how to buy apple cider vinegar. In the past 7 months of only washing my hair with water I have been bothered with dandruff, oil and shape. But the past couple weeks have been golden, feels better than ever. I can take a shower in 45 seconds, that is what i most enjoy about it on a daily basis.   I heard Adam Corolla talking about how he didn't use shampoo, just water, then I thought about how easy that would be. I tried it and it sucked. I never had itchy scalp before I went nopoo, but it went away, with it the dandruff. Anytime I wanted to cave and shampoo and condition my hair I thought about how my two cats, who have never had a proper bath in either a their lives, smell great and have silky smooth hair."

The vinegar is a holdover from when I was doing baking soda and vinegar, and it seems to work pretty well as a conditioner and with itching.

NoPoo,34jzcj,Wong95,3,Fri May 1 20:24:19 2015 UTC,"One: Do you have any friends, particularly female friends, who would be willing to give your hair a sniff and tell you honestly if your hair smells?  (Most women I know have a better sniffer than most of the men I know.)  That's a surefire way to know if your mom is telling you the truth, or just trying to get you to quit no-poo/cut your hair.  Two: What does your mom mean by ""stinks""?  Most no-poo hair will have a natural scent, smelling a little like sebum.  It's not a heavy scent (someone usually has to be VERY close to you to smell it), and I don't think it's a bad smell.  Some people consider the sebum smell to be ""stinky"" simply because they don't think that any scents other than chemical scents are ""clean.""  On the flip side, if you have an extremely musky, sour, or otherwise rancid odor you may not be washing correctly.  This would obviously need to be remedied by altering how you wash and groom.  Three: There's not a lot of natural, no-poo friendly products whose scent lasts for days.  Natural scents tend to fade, especially when not applied in oil.  You can make a scented hair rinse by combining essential oils (orange, lemon, and rosemary tend to be fresh and neutral) with water and rinsing your hair with it after showering.  However, the scent from this process only lasts about 24 hours.  Theoretically you can repeat the process each day provided that the essential oils don't start irritating your scalp."

NoPoo,34jzcj,ammolite,1 point,Sat May 2 10:23:00 2015 UTC,"You can add 5-10 drops of essential oil to a cup of water.  You can just pour the mixture over your head (using a squeeze bottle works well) and work it through in the shower after washing.  Squeeze out the excess, and dry as normal.  You can also put the mixture in a spray bottle and spray it into your hair after showering and drying your hair.  Brush or comb the mixture through, and let it dry as normal."

NoPoo,34jzcj,Ringothefuckingdingo,1 point,Sat May 9 14:08:19 2015 UTC,"Putting a few drops of essential oils into water doesn't really make a cleansing mix.  I would say that these should supplement your conditioner-washing, not replace it.  I'm only recommending using scented rinses because you/your mom think that your hair is ""smelly.""  Using a scented rinse whenever you shower and don't  conditioner-wash your hair will apply a scent to your hair.  Theoretically you can use a rinse every day that you don't conditioner-wash, though some people are sensitive to essential oils and find that their scalp becomes irritated from excessive use.  If your scalp starts feeling dry or irritated, I'd cut-down on the scented rinses (perhaps using them 2-3 times a week).  It's really up to your own discretion, and depends on how badly you feel that your hair needs an outside scene vs. how sensitive your skin and scalp are."

NoPoo,34dtv1,Neil_DeSpace_Cosmos,15,Thu Apr 30 10:07:29 2015 UTC,"For most of my adult life I have had SEVERE dandruff. I had a flare up in university many years ago, went to my dermatologist, and she prescribed me an anti-fungal shampoo and STEROID cream. I literally had to put this stuff in my hair wearing gloves and couldn't get it anywhere else on my body. It helped my dandruff a little bit but it made me break out on my forehead like crazy. So I stopped using it.  Fast forward to my professional life, where the stress of my job and traveling  has only made my dandruff worse. I use super strength T-Gel, it works for like 3 hours then my hair dries out and my dandruff comes back even worse.   About 8 weeks ago I decided I had had enough, so I did a number of things differently. It worked. This week, for the first time in YEARS, I wake up and have no flakes in my hair. I can vigorously scratch my scalp without the dandruff snow, I can wear dark colored shirts, I no longer have to skip to the bathroom to brush large visible flakes out of my eyebrows, hair, and beard. It's gone.  My routine:   I started exercising regularly. I run 3 times per week and tried to start eating healthier (big spinach salads for dinner, no soft drinks only water, fruit smoothie for breakfast). Found pro-biotic with ""Lactobacillus paracasei"" which in some small studies, when taken orally, has been proven to reduce dandruff. I guess by competing with the dandruff fungus/bacteria. I take one pill every other day.   Shower routine:   I shower everyday. Haven't used shampoo in months. For the past two weeks this has been my shower routine. Get hair wet in shower with warm water. Soak with FULL STRENGTH white wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar. Massage into scalp. Don't get this in your eyes. Leave in your hair for 5+ minutes. Turn off hot water if you want to save money. Sit in cold shower, shivering. Daydream about dandruff fungus being destroyed by low pH environment. Smile gleefully. Giggle. Rinse the vinegar out of your hair with 60% ABV vodka OR rubbing alcohol. DO NOT GET THIS IN YOUR EYES. I use the plastic bottles with a small opening so I can squeeze and just add a small amount at a time. Leave alcohol in your hair for 5+ minutes. Massage into scalp. Wish a painful ethanol death to the white walkers ruining your glorious hair. Rinse vinegar/alcohol out with warm water. Protect your eyes. Condition your hair with a small amount of tea tree oil/extract. Massage into scalp. Leave in place for 5+ minutes. This should feel like one thousand ice gnomes doing a square dance on your scalp. Minty fresh. When you are ready to get out of the shower, do a LIGHT rinse of your hair to get off some of the tea tree oil/extract, but don't go crazy because this stuff will block the vinegar scent and continue killing bacteria/fungus throughout your day. Don't vigorously dry your hair with a towel, let it air dry as much as you can so that your hair gets moisturized and won't flake from lack of moisture.   This worked for me. It's extreme, but nothing else was cutting it for me. Keep in mind if you scratch your scalp or have sensitive skin, some of these steps could sting or really hurt you. For me the burn was worth it to rid myself of my dandruff for good. Also keep in mind I usually rotated days and would not use the vinegar/alcohol every day, but every other day. But everyday for at least 2 weeks I have been conditioning with my tea tree oil/extract. Good luck and feel free to PM me or ask any clarifying questions.  TL;DR Exercise consistently. Take oral probiotic with Lactobacillus paracasei. In shower rinse hair with full strength vinegar, then strong alcohol, then water, then condition with tea tree oil/extract.  EDIT: GOLD?!?! WHAT?!?! Wow, thank you so much. Honestly this week couldn't get any better as I have been grinning at myself in the mirror like an idiot due to vanquishing dandruff and now my first Reddit gold.

Dandruff has a strange way of occupying your mind, lowering your self esteem, and forcing you to change your routines (shirts, social outings, timing showers, skipping out on camping trips, etc.). I'd be happy to answer any other questions you have. I will keep you posted on my progress and if I am able to keep my dandruff at bay permanently. In the past I have intermittently tried diluted vinegar rinses, ginger/lemon juice rinses, Head & Shoulders, T-Gel, tea tree shampoo, coconut oil, prescriptions, etc. None of these worked for more than a day or two at a time. The only other time I can recall being dandruff free post-18 was when I worked on a farm for a summer, spent everyday in the hot sun, eating fresh veggies, and burning 3000+ calories per day.

NoPoo,34dtv1,troutleaks,5,Thu Apr 30 15:17:55 2015 UTC,"I used to use a selenium sulphide shampoo for dandruff but switched to an SLS-free shampoo to which I add a few drops of tea tree oil every time I use it and leave it in for about ten minutes. It definitely seems to help with dandruff and I would recommend trying to get some tea tree oil into your scalp once or twice a week. It is very strong stuff and can irritate some people's skin so you could dilute into water and just rub that in.  I think u/skipper_of_otters gave you some good detailed ideas, but as he said quite extreme. Also there are a lot of ideas in there all at once; they might not all be necessary.  I don't like the idea of using alcohol like that as it can be very drying, and personally I couldn't deal with the smell of vinegar washing.  Remember dandruff can be a few fairly different things; it might be due to dryness, or fungal infection, or something like eczema. The treatment that will work best for you will be the one that deals with the cause."

When I got back home, my hair was back to the insane friz of the first 25 years of my life. It was that insane friz you get after your hair has been chemically washed and sterilized and left dry and hollow. It was pretty devastating because right before I went to the barber's, I was at a place of satisfaction with my hair I hadn't previously experienced in my whole life.

I used baking soda/apple cider vinegar for about 2 years and the damage was about 6"" on the end of my hair.  I haven't heard about yeast infections due to water only but I'm guessing that's mostly a fear tactic. If your scalp is healthy you'll have a natural bacteria population that will prevent yeast on its own. IF there's a yeast issue there are natural products (like coconut oil) that can help but prevention by having a healthy scalp would if course be better."
NoPoo,34a9s2,pomeloforest,2,Wed Apr 29 16:20:49 2015 UTC,"mostly a fear tactic.   Sounds like it. Not something I'd imagine more than a handful of people have ever had an issue with, and they probably lived under a bridge and were incapable of any form of hygiene."
NoPoo,34a9s2,Mr-Yellow,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:18:19 2015 UTC,"Ive been nopoo for 2 months. I either started naturally losing hair these past two months OR the BS/ACV method caused it. The timing of it, however, leads me to believe it was the BS/ACV.  I switched to WO and my hair feels, clumpy? stale?. I'm going to hold out a little longer, but I might make the switch back to shampoo."
NoPoo,345fmh,YMic321,13,Tue Apr 28 13:20:38 2015 UTC,"It's hard to make a general statement about blow drying being ""bad"" or ""OK"" because there are so many factors. All of the following will increase the damage to you hair over time:   The frequency with which you blow dry your hair How high the heat setting is How close you hold the dryer (backing away makes a big dent in temperature) How dry you make your hair How much mechanical stress you put on your hair when blow drying vs other drying techniques (like are you always brushing it really hard to straighten it when you blow dry vs some light scrunching when you air dry?) Is your hair naturally prone to breaking/damage Have you applied other chemical treatments that make your hair more susceptible to breaking damage"

The protein from egg washes will overdose your hair if it is used too frequently and you'll end up with dry, brittle hair.  There are a few ways to do egg washes.  For me, I just crack a whole egg in a cup, add a little cold water for easier application and stir well, then apply to dry hair leaning over the tub.  It's a bit messy but it works decently enough.  Always rinse with the coldest water you can stand because picking cooked bits of egg out of your hair for weeks afterward is not fun."

Make sure you use a clean brush every time or else you're basically using old buildup to remove new buildup...which isn't the best thing to do. You can clean your bush by removing all the hair that is caught in the bristles, then soak just the bristles in shampoo-y or soapy water for 10 minutes, then soak it in cold water for 10 minutes, let it dry on a towel until it is completely dry (10-24 hours).

If you decide to try it, I hope you like it as much as I have been liking it so far!"
NoPoo,33uofr,SunshineCat,2,Sun Apr 26 17:31:24 2015 UTC,"Not everyone can go water-only, so don't feel bad!  I also have long, straight, thick hair and I find that the sheer length and thickness seem to cling to the oil, skin, and sebum causing it to look and feel really oily.  That being said, it doesn't mean you have to go right back to shampoo - There are a lot of options for hair care that don't utilize shampoo.  There's a few recipes on the side bar, as well as the rest of the sub, for homemade hair washes and rinses.  Clay, rye flour, honey, and lemon juice are all things you can use to wash your hair and scalp without soap.  Using some type of rinse or wash once or twice a week and W/O washing the rest of the time may help make your hair and scalp feel much better.  If you don't mind using soap, castile soap mixtures or shampoo bars are also options.  I have a friend who swears by Chagrin Valley shampoo bars for her butt-length hair.  I've been using diluted liquid Dr. Bronner's castile soap as a shampoo and diluted ACV as a conditioner for 7 months now (I did 4 months of BS/ACV before that), and am pleased with the results.  Because everybody's body chemistry is completely unique, and everyone has different factors in their daily life, everyone's no-poo routine tends to be unique.  If one method isn't working for you, try another!  Good luck!"
NoPoo,33uofr,Wong95,2,Fri May 1 03:18:36 2015 UTC,"Have you tried thoroughly stritching and washing it more than once per week? The brush isn't enough to loosen the buildup on your scalp. Try stritching before washing it every day -- you'll see drastic improvement immediately if you haven't been doing that. If that works out, you may be able to go every other day. In addition to that, you could sometimes wash your scalp with a conditioner like Tresemmé Naturals if your hair still doesn't look good after a wash. If you have a lot of build up, I've found that sometimes it doesn't look good until I've stritched and washed it two days in a row."
NoPoo,33uofr,irispixie,1 point,Sun Apr 26 13:11:35 2015 UTC,This sounds like a manageable plan. I would rather try washing more often and managing the dry ends first instead of just going back to sulfate free shampoo. Thanks for the ideas.

I condition it with normal conditioner about once or twice a week. I brush it now everyday with a BBB. My hair now feels like normal and smooth. Still a little bit grease look but its gone way less.   So yeah do you wash your hair with water everyday?  Also have you checked what water you have? Soft or hard? If hard then I think you can get one of those filters that fit onto your shower to make it soft."

NoPoo,33k3bp,LawyerWalrus,2,Thu Apr 23 03:52:52 2015 UTC,"I've tried the Chagrin Valley shampoo bars, body wash, whipped shea body/face butter, face soap, and lip balm.  Shampoo bars I have mixed feelings about. They did finally get rid of the damp, heavy feeling hair that I had after months of nopoo. But they also seem to have made the ends of my hair quite a bit more tangly (which i'm guessing is because they're dry). So I'd give them a 9/10 for getting rid of the gross feeling hair, but a 5/10 for making it more prone to tangles. It's also worth mentioning that I just use the shampoo on my scalp - not on the ends. I've also used a very diluted ACV rinse a few times afterwards if I felt like my hair was getting a little soap-scummy.  I could use the BBB on my ends more and seeing if that rehydrates them, but I've found that with the shampoo bar I don't need the BBB for my scalp anymore so I've been neglecting it for the most part. I also haven't tried putting any oils in my ends so I'm not sure I can really fault the product. ALSO I'm fairly certain the semi-hard water I have isn't helping. (I tried a bunch of these, ordered from most favorite to least favorite: soapnuts, honey beer and egg, Ayurvedic Herb, Cafe Moreno.)   The body wash is fine. I actually liked the sample bar they sent me better than the ones I ordered. I didn't use any body wash prior, but I don't like the CV soap enough to make me re-order it. It smells nice and gets the job done, I suppose, but its just my personal opinion that it's unnecessary. (Calenda & Chamomille is the one I like, Coconut Cream is the one I bought that doesnt seem to effect my skin at all)  Whipped shea body butter: smaller sample size than I was expecting :( I mean, I guess it hydrates fine but I wouldn't say its worth it for the price.   Face soap - I bought the Seabuckthorn and Tea Tree face bar. I've been using it on half of my face for maybe a month now. Some customers have said that it helps with roscea, which is why I'm doing half and half to see if I notice a difference. I'm not sure if the differences I'm noticing are my own imagination so I'm going to keep chugging along.  Lip balm... I may get another one of these at some point. There's one with completely different ingredients which I would try because I'm not completely thrilled with the one I have right now. (Aloe butter lip balm)"

Are you massaging your scalp in the shower with your fingertips  (not nails)?  You could always test out using a dry shampoo at home for the excess grease. Cocoa powder, corn starch, baby powder, etc."

NoPoo,33e9dr,kelev,2,Wed Apr 22 12:16:40 2015 UTC,"When I shower, I firmly rub my fingertips against my scalp in a circular motion - much like a hairdresser when she's washing somebody's hair.

NoPoo,33e9dr,ammolite,2,Wed Apr 22 13:51:05 2015 UTC,"I'm doing the same as you, daily water-only.  I did a wash once a week with Dr. Bronner's castille soap at first, but didn't like how it made my hair feel after a while.  Yesterday, I did an egg wash (beat an egg in a cup, slop it on your hair, mix/rub it really well on your head, leave for 3 minutes, wash off with cold-warm water.  not hot, that will cause the egg to cook) and my hair felt amazing after.  Cleaner than it has felt in a long time.  It felt a bit flat but definitely super clean.  I'll probably do one once a week or every 2 weeks if 1/week is too much."
NoPoo,33e9dr,ammolite,1 point,Tue Apr 21 23:45:07 2015 UTC,"When you said that you condition, do you mean that you conditioner-wash?  And you do this 2-3 times per week?  I'm also Asian, and I find that CO (conditioner-only) washing leaves my hair very limp and greasy-looking.  If you're like me, you probably have thick, straight hair and skin that is either combination (dry in some areas, oily in others) or just plain oily.  This combination tends to be bad for CO washing, as the conditioner can leave hair looking (and feeling) heavy, limp, and slick.  Basically what you're describing.  My suggestion would be to cut the CO washing down to once a week, or to cut it out completely.  If you have short hair, you can probably get away with water-only every day of the week.  Fair warning - I find that using a BBB, even as described by other no-pooers, does not work as well for me as it seems to for others.  I'm wondering if this has something to do with the fact that Asian sebum and sebum production is, in fact, a little different than caucasian sebum (perhaps most noticeable via the whole ""ear wax vs ear powder"" study).  So, there is a possibility that you might struggle with being pure water-only.  You can replace your CO washing with shampoo bars and vinegar rinses, honey washes, and a variety of other things than may leave your hair looking and feeling less oily."

But my scalp started getting painfully irritated, so in December I switched to WO/occasional rye flour and aloe vera juice.... And wouldn't you know it, my shedding drastically reduced.   I no longer clog the drain when I clean my hair. I used to spend a lot of time fiddling with my style to cover my bald spots, but I don't now because it seems to have filled in quite a bit (not completely, but enough that I no longer get nervous standing next to tall people).   I used to go through tons of dry shampoo to help hide bald spots, but now I just use it when I get greasy around day 5+ (I go 4-9 days between cleanings; shorter end of the scale if cooking smells get trapped in my hair).

There's going to be trial and error. It's inevitable.  Just try water only first. If that works for you then stay with that.  If you want to see if your hair is oily or dry. Go a week or so without doing anything to it. If it's oily or dry then you have your answer.  Going from there, if it's dry you may want to co-wash periodically. If it's oily then you may just want to rinse your hair more frequently."

NoPoo,338b5p,brenrawr,3,Mon Apr 20 13:22:30 2015 UTC,"Get yourself a boar bristle brush! If you don't already have one, also get a wide-toothed wooden bristled comb or brush. Here's the routine that works for me:  Before bed (or before showering) use the wooden bristled brush to basically scratch your scalp all over. This helps loosen any flakes from your scalp and releases some of the oils from underneath. Next, use the boar bristle brush to pull the oils through from your roots to the tips of your hair. I do this in sections, brushing each one for at least 30 seconds. This will also help to loosen any flakes from your scalp. I like to do this a couple times, usually changing the direction I'm brushing when I go over my head the second time. When you're done, hit the shower and rinse your head in warm water. Make sure to scrub your scalp with your finger tips.   This is a little time intensive, but it is worth it! I actually love the routine now and find it very meditative. Best of luck to you!"

NoPoo,338b5p,Raraan,2,Mon Apr 20 17:27:55 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure those tiny white flakes aren't dandruff. It's probably just build up, which you can prevent by stritching and using a boar bristle brush (go to somewhere like Sally's to find one for cheap). I stritch (mimicking the same motion you do when you wash your scalp) around every other day, usually while browsing reddit or something. Use the brush afterwards.   I was getting those white flakes before I started doing that routine, too. Unfortunately, the side bar here has crap about using baking soda instead of highlighting this necessary step.  Edit: Since you have shorter hair, you may be able to just preen with your fingers in lieu of a boar bristle brush."
NoPoo,338b5p,BCXXR,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:41:15 2015 UTC,"I am also suspicious that it might not be dandruff after all, but rather a dry scalp symptom.  I'm going to buy a BBB in a few days and I'll try the stritching you recommended too. Thanks!"
NoPoo,338b5p,Svevijaro,2,Mon Apr 20 19:36:12 2015 UTC,"Maybe it just takes time to get rid of dandruff. I have the same problem as you and had to use my old anti dandruff shampoo. But now I will use it no more than once a week, where before I washed nearly everyday with shampoo. I still hope to transition later to absolutely no poo."
NoPoo,337fsm,SunshineCat,5,Mon Apr 20 06:02:23 2015 UTC,"No, it's not.   I started doing WO and didn't change anything and went trough a transition period."
NoPoo,337fsm,Oracu,3,Mon Apr 20 12:04:56 2015 UTC,"I think the transition period is real. I am still making mistakes with my own no poo journey. Even when I was using the wrong products with a BBB and trying to stretch those days between washes, I was still seeing small improvements in overall oilyness and health. Granted, once I figured out one thing or another I was doing 'wrong' I would see a little more improvement.   The transition period just makes sense to me because I went through a very similar transition was my face. My thought to combat face oilyness was to not use moisturizer. Obviously my face didn't need any more moisture, it had that WAY covered! But no moisturizer led my skin to over produce etc etc so it's been easy for me to be patient with my hair and scalp. I know it will find its way there but I have to let it make its own adjustments.   I still have problems with the separation you mentioned. I would LOVE some tips on that. I could get another day out of my hair :("
NoPoo,337fsm,Wiskerbiskit,2,Mon Apr 20 13:33:45 2015 UTC,"I think it probably differs from person to person and their hair and skin type (and probably also the water type!).  Personally I started about 1.5 month ago, and switched from shampooing every other day to washing it with water only once every 5 days or so. I did not do a build up period where I slowly increased the time between washing or anything. And after reading quite some stories here about people having their transition periods with horrible greasy hair, I am amazed by how well my hair has been doing from the start! I attribute a LOT of that to scritching and preening and the boar bristle brush. So I my case there definitely seems to be some truth to your idea. When I used to shampoo my hair I never really brushed, and my hair could not go longer than 2-3 days without looking greasy. Now my hair looks okay a lot longer. I do have sebum buildup (always have had that) and the hair definitely feels different than freshly shampood hair feels. But I noticed that while my hair might feel greasy-ish, it doesn't have to look like it! What really seems to make the big difference for me is to move my hands wildly through my hair, messing it up, after a scritch/preen/brush session. This separates the hair and gets rid of that more greasy look. Messing my greasy hair up to make it look better would only work for a short while when I still shampood my hair (like half an hour or so), but now with the water only hair it just keeps the messy, more voluminous look :)"
NoPoo,337fsm,fazalazim,2,Mon Apr 20 15:34:34 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, it is real, although for example I realized that WO works much better for my hair type than co-washing and I felt a dramatic improvement in my hair after that change. Overall though, I originally did no-poo a year or so ago and it definitely got easier after awhile. I started back again a few weeks ago after dyeing my hair red and I have definitely had to start back 'at square one', though it's been much easier now that I'm a pro at BBB technique and scritching before/during washing."
NoPoo,337fsm,sa-sa-samantha,1 point,Wed Apr 22 23:52:13 2015 UTC,"You can use our Skinchanted NoPoo daily without any damage/issues.    A lot of what you're going through is simply finding your balance.  There are people who can go weeks or months without washing, and those (like me) who need to clean daily.    How I would have you go through this (if you were to ask me) is to use the NoPoo daily for 1-2 weeks, then try every other day with W/O or nothing on the odd days.  Do that for 1-2 weeks and drop another day, and so on until you find your 'sweet spot'.    The big thing is being methodical and making note of what works/doesn't.    Feel free to ping me if you have any questions on the product."
NoPoo,337fsm,JeF4y,1 point,Mon Apr 20 14:50:07 2015 UTC,"FWIW everything I've read says it's a myth. I have a theory as to why everyone thinks they start producing less oil though. My theory is basically that conventional hair care--sulfates and all--truly dries your hair out and leaves the ends very damaged because the ends of your hair have been subjected over and over to being washed and have dried out. Near your roots has not been subjected for as long so it's in better shape. When you first stop washing your hair, the roots get oily quickly but the oil hasn't gotten to the driest parts of your hair thus accentuating the oily roots. After a while, if you don't wash your hair for long enough, the oil will creep down to the ends and will look more uniform throughout. Plus oil from your scalp probably redistributes itself much better when your whole strand of hair is in good shape/ has oil on it. The longer/ more damaged your hair is, the longer it will take to get the oil down the whole strand. Once that occurs, your hair is healthier, the whole strand is shinier thus oil in the roots is less noticeable and even just water will help remove any excess.  But the reason why no poo doesn't work for everyone is that some people genuinely produce too much oil for water to do the trick of removing excess oil. I'd be willing to bet no poo would work for more than half of people out there. It doesn't work if you're one of those shampoo in the morning and are oily by the afternoon kind of person.  Plus clean is sort of subjective so what you thought was oily before no-poo might not be so bad after you've gotten used to no-poo. In my journey from shampoo to low-poo my hair still produces way too much excess oil but it isn't as noticeable as it was before. I also suspect since my hair is long and damaged, it will take longer for the ends to get coated with natural oil. So to me the transition phase can only be explained by replacing the waxy product-y shine with your own natural shine and finding a way to get off/ redistribute the excess oil without stripping it. That's why I prefer things like aloe Vera or skinchanted's low poo over baking soda and shampoo bars, they're less stripping but still take off the excess from my roots.   If only skinchanted would reopen their website."

I ended up getting 6 inches of hair chopped off because I didn't feel like the shitty ends were worth saving   In a post about shampoo on some other sub, there was someone who worked in R&D at a shampoo manufacturer. I believe it was this person who said that something in shampoo triggers increased oil production, just like hot water does. I've read that other places as well, so it doesn't seem to have much to do with the scalp being dry."

I've done vibrant red for years, from using Mane and Tail to co-washing to water only. You can lessen the fading through reducing your washes (mine is once to twice per week) and preferably using no product at all (I'm water-only and the only product I use is LUSH No Drought, and very very very occasionally the Not Your Mother's Sea Salt Spray).  Learning to properly work with dry shampoo after day 2ish and BBB-ing every single night with proper technique will be your best friends in maintaining vibrant red hair. That said, you'll still look like you're bleeding in the shower the first 3-4 washes after dyeing no matter what - that's just the nature of red dye. Don't let yourself get too discouraged by it. Another tip is to wait as long as possible after dyeing for your first wash in order to let the dye set."

NoPoo,3305bt,BCXXR,1 point,Sat Apr 18 18:20:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, the last line in the OP says I have been.  But I did buy it about a month ago and have been using it nearly daily.  This was a sharp rise in the amount of dandruff when I started the argan treatment.  For several weeks prior to argan oil, no significant dandruff, started using argan oil the next day, and then severe dandruff the next day."
NoPoo,3305bt,BCXXR,2,Sat Apr 18 20:32:32 2015 UTC,"If I were you I'd avoid getting an excessive amount of oil on your scalp. Your scalp should already be producing a sufficient amount of oil, and if not, perhaps consider using coconut oil only on the tips of your hair. Don't take hot showers, or if you do, don't get the hot water on your scalp and at the end of the shower use cool or cold water to wash your hair. For the record, nuts and nut oils are known to cause inflammation to the body, so I'd definitely avoid all forms of oils that aren't coconut oil (which is ironically a nut, but doesn't cause inflammation at all)."
NoPoo,3305bt,BCXXR,1 point,Sat Apr 18 20:44:21 2015 UTC,"I have pretty long hair, so when I apply the argan oil, it really only reaches the outer layer of my hair.  I use a plastic comb to distribute evenly throughout, but I don't apply it directly to my scalp.  If I don't use argan oil, my dandruff is small, but still more than I'm comfortable with.  What effect does coconut oil to my tips have?"
NoPoo,3305bt,fernando_69,1 point,Sat Apr 18 21:10:33 2015 UTC,"Well I imagine that you used argan oil on your hair to make it less dry and look better? It will definitely not help with your dandruff and will only make it worse, as you have seen. Most cases of dandruff are due to poor oil distribution throughout ones head, which leads to the scalp creating more oil. Excessive amount of oil leads to bacterial growth on the scalp, and thus leads to dandruff.  I personally wouldn't use any oil on my scalp, but I said that if your hair is very dry and you feel like you need to, you'd probably be better of using coconut oil than argan oil"

You could get aquainted with hats. Or start washing you hair every second day, when your comfortable with that then go every third, then every fourth etc. Thats how I did it, and now im down to washing once per week. It is worth pointing out though that i didn't do it for thinning or hair health reasons. I did it because i dye my hair red and every time i wash my hair the colour runs down the plug hole. Thats my way of extending the length of my colour."

However if you think you're balding, I don't think nopoo, or anything else, will slow that down."
NoPoo,32yccx,iamspoonman,2,Fri Apr 17 21:29:58 2015 UTC,I wouldn't fully shave. Buzz cut to a #2 would be fine though. Being fully shaved and having flaky skin would be even more embarrassing IMO.
NoPoo,32yccx,anonlymouse,2,Sat Apr 18 02:33:52 2015 UTC,"28 year old female here. I shaved my head to a #1 about two months ago for Cansa, and went Water Only at the same time.   From my personal experience, the greasy adjustment period is still going on, but it's getting less and less now. My scalp is a bit dry and flaky, but it's not very noticeable. I did get sunburnt a few weeks ago, which also didn't help!   I exercise regularly (three or four times a week), my scalp and hair do get very sweaty, but I can get away with ""washing"" with water once a week, just massaging my scalp with my fingers in the shower with hot water for 5 minutes.   Personally, my hair looks a lot thicker. I don't know if you'll experience the same thing, but without harsh shampoos stripping my hair down to nothing, it's looking a lot thicker and healthier. Massaging your scalp also helps to increase blood flow and make your hair grow better, apparently. I don't know if it will help grow your hair back if it's thinning in a male-pattern-baldness kind of way, but it doesn't hurt to try!   I felt shaving my head was a good starting point, mainly because my hair was very dry and had damage from all the heat styling I did when it was long. I had nothing to lose, i was going to do it for charity anyway, but it gave me the opportunity to start over, as such, and let it grow in without doing things to damage it. If you decide to go with it, I hope it works out for you, so far it's been working for me.  Edit: sorry this is so long, i didn't notice it turned into an essay! Another point is that after shaving your head, your hair is too short to notice greasiness during the adjustment period, if you have any."

I've used about two tablespoons of corn starch (dry shampoo) since the beginning of february, and maybe a half tablespoon of olive oil (moisturizer). I have very long hair, and used to go through $16 of tresemme in a similar amount of time.  Unfortunately I can't tell you anything about receeding hairlines. My boyfriend's hairline has been receeding since he was about that age though. It might be normal. Maybe you'll end up with a sweet widow's peak?

My previously softly-waving hair is becoming downright curly and it's glorious.  Overall, it's much healthier and the $$ saved on product is incredible.  I can avoid those aisles at the store completely, as my routines consist of baking soda, apple cider vinegar and brushing.  I can't speak to hair loss.  It could be genetic.

I'm a dude, so I don't know if it'll be different (donno if you're a dude or a gal ;D)   What kind of stuff do you use for your hair instead? Why baking soda and apple cider vinegar (wut?). Can you explain this to me? :-)"
NoPoo,32sphn,BagelTrollop,2,Thu Apr 16 18:37:16 2015 UTC,"So far as I know, women carry the baldness gene so you MAY be okay.  My kids are screwed one day, as I am indeed a lady.  My dad went bald at a young age.  So far as scalp chemistry goes, I don't believe sex matters.  Baking Soda solution (bs mixed with water) is an effective yet gentle cleanser for your hair, but you want to have a well-balanced scalp, so you need to follow up with an acid (baking soda is basic on the pH scale) such as Apple Cider Vinegar (also diluted in water).  The sidebar has a lot of great information about different cleansers.  I'll probably change up my routine soon to see what else works well for me.  Truth be told, I don't use either that often, preferring to brush my hair a great deal instead.  I do use shampoo on my boar bristle brush to clean it, though.  Some people use raw honey as a cleanser for their hair and skin, as well.  I may try that soon.  The majority of the time, though, I massage my scalp under hot water when I shower.  I'm thorough.  I treat my scalp as though I were getting shampooed by my hairdresser and really dig in a bit with my fingertips.  It helps all the natural oils move down the hair shaft and away from the scalp.  Another option is Dry Shampoo.  It's sold in aerosol cans, but you can use basic household items to create the same effect.  Baby powder, cornstarch, cocoa powder (good on darker shades of hair).  Sprinkle it on your roots, wait a little while, brush it out.  It soaks up excess grease and leaves your hair soft and fluffy afterward.  All of this said, going no-poo takes some work.  There is definitely a greasy period while your scalp adjusts to its newfound freedom.  However, it WILL figure itself out.  It might take a month or two, even.  Lots of brushing and hot water massages will help.  I prefer to let it be greasy and settle itself before using any sort of cleanser.  I want it to know how to behave without help, if that makes sense.  Your scalp is like an addict in a way and it needs to go cold turkey or else it will never give up needing help from artificial sources (shampoos and conditioners).  From what I've read, shampoo was originally introduced to help battle hard water buildup - not to clean ""dirty"" hair.  After shampoo strips away all the natural oils, conditioner is then used to replenish moisture.  Like somebody bouncing between caffeine and sleeping pills.  They can do it on their own without the help, but there's a period of adjustment."

NoPoo,32sphn,rmg22893,-6,Fri Apr 17 21:08:16 2015 UTC,"Your hair loss is probably due to having a diet that consists of extreme amounts of mineral inhibitors, such as wheat and certain nuts. If you have an open mind, consider cutting dairy, wheat, corn, soy, vegetable oils, high fructose corn syrup etc out of your diet and eat more vegetables and fruit, and drink more water. I did this, and my hair loss stopped completely and is growing back slowly. Mine wasn't bad though, it was only receding around the temples. My right side was worse than my left.  Believe what you want but perhaps start to consider the possibility of the things you put into your body effecting your organs which control how your body works and what it chooses to do.   If you're not interested in a more natural route, you could always go get a prescription for Propecia, however, you may end up with gynecomastia, and other more feminine attributes due to the increase in estrogen in your body. Minoxodil could also be useful if this is the route you wish to take.     Of course this may not be the most commonly held opinion. Most people will tell you that you're going bald due to an excessive amount of dihydro-testosterone, and there is nothing you can do. They'll point you towards things like Propecia which will mess with your bodily hormones and make you feel like shit.

Her perception of that is the issue here, seeing a change is being perceived in a dysmorphic manner. If the change is real, it may well indicate that whatever was being used previously had altered the actual natural colour of her hair.  It would be silly to think that ""I was putting stuff in my hair, now that I've stopped it's no longer natural"". It's more natural, just not what the person is used to seeing in the mirror.

Doing a search for ""straight, fine hair"" will reveal many different options that worked for different people. The first thing you need to determine is how much you want to ""do work.""   Meaning, do you just want to transition to a natural, no-poo friendly shampoo and conditioner and only use it twice a week? Or do you really want to get earthy crunchy and use honey washes and vinegar rinses? Or maybe something in between with a shampoo bar?  Whatever path you choose, sometbing will eventually work. Be honest about the time you have to commit to this and if you want to be able to buy your products in your local grocery store or order them online.  Regardless, I would recommend getting a boar bristle brush and dry shampoo (the cornstarch kind - even just cornstarch works). It's up to you if you want yo get a clarifying shampoo and conditioner to make the transition easier, by it also makes it longer. There are a lot of suggestions for those products on this sub.

NoPoo,32nhvg,rocketchips,1 point,Wed Apr 15 20:27:22 2015 UTC,"I used to wash my fine, wavy hair every day, because otherwise it looked as if I hadn't showered for months. I started off by washing it every other day and using dry shampoo the days in between. (Certain hairstyles also helped to hide the greasiness.) Eventually I started washing with conditioner only (legit, just soaked my hair in conditioner completely, and moved it around as I would shampoo), and started going as far as 3 or 4 days without washing my hair. I've been doing that for almost 5 years now. Maybe once every 2 months or so, I clarify my hair with shampoo if I feel it needs it - but this always leaves my hair feeling... weird. haha. Anyway, this is what I did so as not to have to wash my hair every morning. It really sucks at first, and I swear I used the entire can of dry shampoo the first few times, but believe me, it gets better :) Good luck!"

NoPoo,32mrt2,Lostforwords2,1 point,Thu Apr 16 05:40:42 2015 UTC,"Check out this site on how to safely dilute essential oils - its going to be more like a cup of water to a few drops of oil.  You may also want to do a patch test as well.  Kepp in mind lemon is drying to hair as well, so get some coconut oil on it after.  http://www.aromaweb.com/articles/dilutingessentialoils.asp"
NoPoo,32mrt2,ammolite,1 point,Fri Apr 17 02:18:45 2015 UTC,"The first thing you need to do is to identify the source of the odor.  What method of no-poo do you use?  If you're using an ACV rinse, your hair may smell like ACV when you sweat or when your hair gets wet.  If you're using certain oils to condition, those oils can go rancid if you don't rinse them out well enough.  A few other methods using food products (ex: rye flour, egg wash) can also create a smell if you don't rinse well enough.  If you use a BBB, be sure to wash it regularly with mild soap!  If possible, scrub the bristles with an old toothbrush to help remove all of the old sebum.  If you're not cleaning your brush well enough, you may be continuously brushing old sebum back into your hair, which can cause an odor.  If you're WO, then there's a few reasons that your hair can have an odor.  One reason is that you're not washing often enough for the amount of sweat and bacteria that form on your body.  I know that WO advocates only wetting your hair once a week, but some people just sweat more than others.  Letting that sweat sit for days can create a smell.  Simply rinsing your hair and scalp more often (without scrubbing) can help this issue.  Another reason that you hair may ""smell"" is the natural sebum your body produces.  This is just, well, how your body (and essentially everyone's body) smells naturally.  I don't think it's a bad smell, and there's very little you can do about it.  This natural smell is more noticeable in those who don't use commercial soaps and shampoos because these people aren't layering their bodies with chemicals that strip or mask natural oils.  Some people associate this natural sebum scent (also found on babies and young children who don't use harsh soaps and shampoos) with being ""dirty,"" so they believe that anyone with this scent is ""dirty"" and ""stinks.""  Rest assured that, if this is the reason your mom thinks your hair smells, YOU DO NOT ACTUALLY SMELL.  For most people this sebum scent is so faint that people can only smell it if they're right next to you, burying their face in your hair.  If you feel the need to get rid of the sebum-smell, there are a few things you can do.  The first, of course, is to wash your scalp more often with some type of rinse or solution.  This can be a strong herbal tea (many herbs are good for your hair), honey wash, an ACV rinse with added essential oils, or even the regular use of a natural hair mask utilizing things like avocado or banana.  You can also attempt to apply some sort of scent to your hair.  As you suggested, you CAN mix essential oils into water and apply the mix as a hair rinse.  However, be warned - The scent from such rinses DOES NOT linger like the scent from shampoos.  It fades fairly quickly, and will most likely be gone within 24 hrs.  You'll have to reapply the scented water again the next day, which begins to defeat the purpose of water-only (namely to not have to wet your hair daily).  Also, continued daily use of essential oils on your scalp and hair can eventually cause some irritation if you're using a strong dilution."

NoPoo,32lz16,llomas01,3,Tue Apr 14 21:20:15 2015 UTC,"Dandruff is a very specific condition caused by organisms on your scalp that take specific ingredients to get rid of them. Most people who think they have dandruff actually just have a dry scalp, or, in the case of no pooers, sebum flakes.   Dry scalp is easy - keep in more moisture. I doubt you have that, though, as you use conditioner. Best bet is sebum flakes. I'm thinking the conditioner isn't doing a good job of removing the build up.   When you shower, use the BBB right before. In the shower, wet your hair and leave it for a bit. Then, wet it again and use your fingers to really scritch around your scalp, then rinse while using your finger to ""pull"" the oil down the hair. After this, then apply your conditioner and then thoroughly wash in out. Remnants of conditioner can add the build up.  I'm not familiar with the conditioner you use, so I can't speak to it's quality, but hopefully this will help."

If you do, here's my recommended routine: before the shower, scritch & preen your scalp with your fingertips, then use a Boar bristle brush to brush your hair for a few minutes, then take your shower and run your fingers through your hair in the shower. Right before you get out, turn the water to cold and scrub your hair/scalp with your hands. It helps your hair not look shiny/oily.  Then I let it air dry.

I hated how dry and frizzy my hair felt after I washed it so I was only washing it every 5-10 days. After some discussions with a friend about ""no-poo"", I decided to try just co-washing with just conditioner when I hit a point where we were moving and I ran out of shampoo at the same time.    I had already joined this sub and realized that the silicone based smoother and conditioner I was using was not helping, so I went looking for one without silicone.    I found one that was vegan, with no petro chemicals, artificial fragrances and whatnot at Walmart for $6, but they arent making it any more. so I tried this, Alba Botanica conditioner and it smells great but not as thick as the other stuff and I couldn't get a comb through my hair after washing until it was dry.   I just bought some stuff from walgreens that is supposed to be like the WEN haircare stuff but I havent tried it yet.  All I have done is reduce the amount of washing, switch to co-wash only and start using a boar bristle brush regularly.  I started in October and by Christmas i kind of had the hang of it all.  I have never tried baking soda or clay or anything else.  Using the co-wash DOES take a bit longer than shampooing as you have to scrub the scalp with your fingertips for longer, but it seems to be working and I have very fine, nearly waist length hair. I can go 3-5 days between cleanings and only look slightly oily.  i DO have 1 lush, Godiva shampoo bar in case i need to actually WASH my hair and it does not seem to hurt it as much as it used too. does take a few extra days to mellow out again though."

It gently lifts the pigment from your hair- obviously this depends on whether or not you've used a permanent or semi permanent dye. I have permanently dyed black hair (my natural color is blonde as well) and have found that using this method once a week will significantly 'pull' color from your hair, making it easier to use a different color process later on.   Just make sure you get high quality vitamin c tablets and crush them up very finely before mixing."

I love the idea of nopoo, and of using clarifying conditioners - I just haven't had the guts to try it again after that week and a half of scalp torture. If anyone else with seborrhoeic dermatitis has managed to stick it out longer and seen results then I would definitely give it another go."
NoPoo,325nof,katiebellVIII,2,Fri Apr 10 22:08:55 2015 UTC,"I've got diagnosed seborrheic dermatitis, I've been using the prescribed Ketozolen shampoo 1 or 2 times a week and been using some argan oil-based conditioner on other days. As long as I use the prescribed shampoo once a week, I don't have an itchy scalp as much and my hair doesn't get super flaky or thin in between shampoo use.  I personally wouldn't do a conditioner only routine as itchiness and inflammation on your scalp will get worse and worse and possibly lead to some hair loss."
NoPoo,325nof,Scooternuts,3,Sat Apr 11 00:45:53 2015 UTC,"I haven't been diagnosed, but I have painful itchy dandruff that I'm pretty sure is SD on my face and scalp. (I'm trying to get my insurance to pay for a dermatologist appointment right now) I've had pretty good results with an ACV rinse. The first time it touched my scalp, it was like magic, the itch just melted away. It always comes back in a day or two. The typical ""you'll only need to wash once a week!"" doesn't seem like it's going to apply any time soon, and I've been doing this for six months now."
NoPoo,325nof,MercifulWombat,2,Fri Apr 10 22:26:26 2015 UTC,"I have SD, a sufferer for almost 10 years and it is the worst! I stopped trying to do anything about it a couple of years ago after trying everything.   About seven months ago I started nopoo and tried incorporating tea tree oil with no major changes. Based on how nopoo just didn't work with my hair (I wasn't diligent about doing things other than not using shampoo and I also have curly hair), I started doing cowashing about a month ago with better scalp results (and my hair is great).   I recently went to a derm for the first time in years who looked at me like I was crazy when I said I don't use shampoo. She suggested I use clobetasol and t gel routine. I'm hesitant to start it because t gel and other scripts have done nothing in the past.  So longt story short, once I went nopoo my flaking went down and itching was less. Since cowashing, my itching is completely gone and my flaking is the best it's been in 10 years. I still do flake but I have to be like picking my head or running my fingers through my hair.   Hope this helps, I would say try it, esp with use of conditioner"
NoPoo,325nof,mehhgunn,2,Sat Apr 11 04:49:53 2015 UTC,What hair type do you have and what products are you using?
NoPoo,325nof,katiebellVIII,2,Sat Apr 11 05:49:32 2015 UTC,I have 2c hair and I'm definitely still in the experimental phase with my products but I've been using Giovanni deeper moisture conditioner and andalou naturals leave in conditioner. I'm planning on adding in gel soon as I still have some frizz. I've also tried the giovanni triple threat tea tree oil conditioner and my scalp/hair did not like it as much.
NoPoo,325nof,mehhgunn,1 point,Sat Apr 11 07:16:37 2015 UTC,"Yup,  I do.  Been nopoo since early 2008 because regular shampoo made my scalp incredibly painful,itchy and flakey. I was changing my shampoo every month.   When I did conditioner only (2008-2013), I only used conditioner on the length of my hair, not my scalp. It worked pretty well, but had occasional problems.   After that I started honey washing. That worked better for my scalp.   Now I've moved to a hot country with lots of bugs. Did a honey wash and came back later to a shower full of ants. So maybe I need a new routine now.   As far as my face goes, scrubbing my face with honey worked well as long as I moisturised afterwards (a few drops of almond oil, or very specific moisturiser -  most moisturisers don't work well with my skin).   I still get flare ups behind my ears occasionally, but it's nowhere near how it used to be."
NoPoo,325nof,doctorkat,-5,Sat Apr 11 14:35:03 2015 UTC,"My friend, take it as you will. Auto immune conditions do not happen randomly and are a result of bigger bodily issues. To put it blunt, if you want to heal your autoimmune issues you should look into changing your diet. If you're going to eat meat, eat meat that is not fed corn all of its life, but instead grass fed, as well as not being injected with an extreme amount of antibiotics all its life. Stop eating food that inhibits mineral absorption like Wheat, unsoaked nuts, etc. No wheat, corn, soy or dairy. Invest in a cheap vegetable juicer and juice every day if you can. Eat more vegetables, fruits and more healthy fats (coconut oil is the best one). Avoid unhealthy fats marketed as being healthy such as vegetable oil.   Ask yourself if you have dry skin, or take very hot showers. Consider not taking hot showers or at least washing your hair at a later point in the shower under cold water.  Perhaps invest in a boar bristle brush to evenly distribute the oil from your scalp to your hair.     There's so many ideas out there, I myself have some dandruff myself. The one thing I'm sure you know by now is that you are not going to cure your dandruff with topical shampoos/ointments. You're going to need to find the root cause.  My advice is just my opinions, and if you don't like them you can just disregard them, it's up to you. Best of luck man and if you find something that works let me know.    Have you ever taken any drugs like Accutane?"
NoPoo,324w3y,tallriktallrik,3,Fri Apr 10 16:33:51 2015 UTC,Sounds more like residue build up in your hair.  Do you do an acidic rinse after shampooing?
NoPoo,324w3y,Greyzer,1 point,Sat Apr 11 07:45:18 2015 UTC,As an experiment I've started out with completely clean hair (washed with clarifying shampoo) and then washed with the bar. My hair always became sticky after using the bar. I never use any hair products either. Must be an issue with the type of shampoo bar I'm using. I'll experiment with others in the future-- for now I'm using Dr. Bronner's liquid soap and I'm loving the results :)
NoPoo,324w3y,loligogiganticus,1 point,Tue Apr 21 13:42:50 2015 UTC,"I don't leave my shampoo bars in the shower - they're only in there while I'm using them. Letting them dry out/re-harden between uses seems to make them last longer, or at least it has in my experience.   As far as the sticky hair goes, try an acidic rinse. I do one every 3rd or 4th wash. You can do diluted ACV, or, if you aren't keen on the scent, a citric acid rinse (1/4 tsp per cup of water).   FWIW I live in an area with moderately hard water. If I don't do regular acidic rinses, I WILL get the gummy/waxy hair, as well as flaky scalp."
NoPoo,324w3y,iamaravis,0,Sun Apr 12 17:02:05 2015 UTC,"Are you using styling products in your hair? I've read (and experienced) that Liggett's shampoo bars won't clean the gels or some other products out of hair.   Also, if your hair is long, are you applying the bar (rubbing the bar) directly along the lengths of your hair? If you aren't doing that, then you are probably aren't getting the lengths clean. I have to scrub all down my hair, not just scrub the scalp and assume the suds will clean the lengths."
NoPoo,32313p,thefapper1,3,Fri Apr 10 04:10:57 2015 UTC,"There are ingredients that cause lather that are not technically sulfates, so companies can label those products as sulfate free. Sulfosuccinates and sarcosinates, among others, are byproducts of the manufacturing of sulfates. They are not quite as harsh as sulfates but are still made from the same metallic salt sources. There are some surfactants (foaming agents) made from vegetable sources, like decyl glucoside (beet derived, used in some SheaMoisture cleansers) and cocamides (coconut oil + fatty alcohols, used in DevaCurl Low Poo), that are not harsh/drying to the hair, and are also from renewable resources. The last time I checked the Loreal stuff, it still contained sulfosuccinates."
NoPoo,32313p,hurrdresser,1 point,Fri Apr 10 15:13:32 2015 UTC,"Looked over the label and yup they contain sulfosuccinates.  I did read howver that sulfosuccinates are much milder and do not strip the hairs oil the same way that SLS and SLES do.  Should I be avoiding sulfosuccinates and are they as bad as what we've come to know as ""sulfates""?"
NoPoo,32313p,hurrdresser,1 point,Sun Apr 12 23:22:38 2015 UTC,"They are definitely less harsh, but less bad than the worst can still be pretty bad. As a rule, I avoid anything that isn't a vegetable surfactant."

NoPoo,32313p,hurrdresser,1 point,Mon Apr 13 20:00:20 2015 UTC,"SheaMoisture is my absolute favorite of the store brands. They have a Co-Wash Conditioning Cleanser that I like to recommend, especially if you're looking for a 2-in-1 kind of situation and may not need extra conditioning. The rest of their shampoos use vegetable based surfactants, so whichever suits your fragrance preference/particular hair needs works. I use DevaCurl No Poo myself, it has no surfactants whatsoever."
NoPoo,32313p,enyri,1 point,Mon Apr 13 20:25:13 2015 UTC,I thought SheaMoisture was made for curly hair specifically?  Might have to look into grabbing a bottle of SheaMoisture.
NoPoo,32313p,enyri,1 point,Wed Apr 15 14:07:20 2015 UTC,"The coconut hibiscus line is specifically, but the descriptions of the rest of their product collections talk about the target of each line.  Most products that are suitable for curls or waves are great to use on straight hair also, it's not like it's going to make your hair curly. Some conditioners might be too heavy for finer straight hair, but in general curly products just tend to be less drying and more moisture providing."
NoPoo,32313p,JeF4y,1 point,Wed Apr 15 14:57:02 2015 UTC,"For the shampoos, they should all be ok for use on straight hair, but as with most any products, your mileage may vary depending on your particular needs. Since curly hair tends to be drier on average than straight hair, a lot of ""curly"" hair products tend to be very moisturizing, which may work great for you, may work great for awhile, or may just be too much and leave your hair feeling limp, greasier, or waxier. It's hard to know beforehand how it will work for you though.   That being said, their styling products and conditioners that I have tried, tend to be pretty intensely moisturizing and can be too much for even for my wavy/curly hair. I'm not saying not to try them ever, but I wouldn't dump a whole mess of money on a bunch of them all at once, maybe try one product you think you need at a time."

I would wash it once a month with organic neem shampoo. My hair was just too long then to deal with it. My question is do you guys do anything about the natural hair smell from doing water only. my wife says it's not smelly. Just smells like hair that hasn't been washed for a day. I rinse for about 5 min with water everday, 2 min of which is with a shampoo brush (sans shampoo obviously) to stimulate scalp.  So again do you guys do anything about the smell of your hair or no? If so, what? I was thinking of getting some sort of tea tree or peppermint oIL or something"
NoPoo,31ww99,rubiredd,3,Thu Apr 9 12:40:30 2015 UTC,"I don't really mind the hair smell at all but if I'm doing something super fancy I'll boil up some water with a handful of rosemary in it, wait for it to cool down (very important step!), and then rinse my hair with it after doing the regular water only wash method.

I remember I used to have super thick hair and in my early 20s it started to thin, which scared me. I switched to Lush shampoos which made it a bit better I think. Then I gave up on shampoo altogether and, after getting a citrus water filter for my shower, I am completely happy with the amount and thickness of my hair.

It is much too harsh to be a sustainable routine.  Many of us here have lost half a foot of hair after using baking soda long term.  Baking soda is so harsh that it denatures the proteins in your hair which produces a slick result aka ""soft hair"" but as the baking soda further denatures your hair over long term use, it will become brittle and break and snap off.  There is no way to repair the denatured proteins once the damage has been done."

NoPoo,31ic2n,strangetitss,1 point,Mon Apr 6 18:28:06 2015 UTC,How damaged is your hair? I think a really good deep conditioner once a week would be good. Get a really good one that has no added sulfates or other damaging ingredients.  There's cheap natural ones like Tresemme naturals or Trader Joes tea tree tingle conditioner. I really like shea moisture's line of products as well. I use the deep conditioning mask and add some olive oil in it; put a plastic bag on my head with a hot towel on top and when you rinse you shouldn't have any tangles and your hair will slip right through your fingers with ease. Make sure you detangle with the conditioner still lathered on there.  Don't be stingy with the conditioner.   You mentioned your hair had bleached highlights. All the more reason to deep condition your hair AT LEAST once a week.  If it feels greasy afterwards spray some equal parts ACV+water mix and leave it on for5 or ten minutes.    You gotta try different approaches and see how your hair responds to each one.
NoPoo,31ic2n,strangetitss,1 point,Mon Apr 6 19:06:35 2015 UTC,"Well. I recently had 3 inches or so blunt cut off to get all of my hair one length and of a good quality. The highlights decreased the quality and made it drier but it seems a million times drier since I've stopped using shampoo. Can you tell me, what is the point in no-poo? Is it to stop your hair being greasy as that isn't really a problem for me. I am looking for a solution to my hair matting and tying in knots all the time. I'm about two glasses of wine away from shaving my head and starting again."
NoPoo,31ic2n,Greyzer,1 point,Mon Apr 6 20:19:07 2015 UTC,"I personally use shampoo once in a while.  I put a lot of oils and leave in conditioners in my hair so shampooing is sometimes necessary if I don't feel that ""slip"" after co-washing. (I personally use Bentonite clay to clean my hair).  I don't think it's bad to use shampoo. Just limit to like once a week and use something all natural. Again, Tresemme has a natural shampoo and I like Trader Joes tea tree tingle shampoo and conditioner. Absolutely no sulfates.  Your hair is probably dry because it desperately wants moisture.     Can you tell me, what is the point in no-poo? Is it to stop your hair being greasy   I think these are some of the main points: helping people to realize that you don't need all those unnatural/harsh ingredients to clean your hair, washing your hair every single day or every other day may actually be drying for your hair if you don't follow with a conditioner or do deep conditioning, shampoo strips your hair of its natural goodness.    Keep the questions coming. I'm happy to help.  I have fine strands, super curly coils, and my hair can be a tangly mess sometimes. But conditioner is a girls best friend."

The days I don't wash my hair I don't get my hair wet, but that's mainly because I don't want to wait for it to dry.  There's no real problem with washing your hair every day with water if that's what you prefer. It won't be damaging in the same way as if you used a lot of shampoo every day."
NoPoo,31dt96,doctorkat,1 point,Sat Apr 4 14:07:46 2015 UTC,"It depends on your head, really. I have to wet my hair every day because I have a pixie that looks ridiculous when I wake up in the morning. Without getting it wet, despite brushing with a boar bristle brush, my head resembles a rooster.  My hair and scalp are perfectly fine with a daily rinse. I just make it a point not to use very hot water, as that tends to dry out my hair. Experiment - you won't know what works best for your head without trying a few different methods. Good luck!"
NoPoo,31dt96,brenrawr,1 point,Sat Apr 4 17:21:31 2015 UTC,"Washing your hair with water is called water only washing. I'm nopoo for almost 7 weeks. Started with baking soda and avc.

NoPoo,31dt96,stopguacnroll,4,Sat Apr 4 03:27:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think that you can reasonably say that simply wetting your hair is just as damaging as using traditional shampoo. I'm not saying that water isn't damaging at all, but you have to have some perspective."
NoPoo,31dhgx,Traumaturge,1 point,Sat Apr 4 01:02:19 2015 UTC,"Taking a shower and doing your normal nopoo method should clean it out, but I wouldn't be too worried about it. The damage it will do to your hair will probably be negligible unless you're standing out in heavy rain all day. If you're really worried though, why not wear a hat or use an umbrella?"
NoPoo,31bpge,scottymtp,5,Fri Apr 3 16:36:53 2015 UTC,"When did you start no soaping? I have been transitioning to no poo for years, but cutting back hard on the soap for several months now. Male or female? Female Do you exercise? Not vigorously or often, no. Yoga and walking from place to place is about it. When and how often do you take showers? About every 3-4 days or sooner if necessary. Water temperature? Warm but comfortable. Not hot or cold. Do you use soap (or other substitute like baking soda) on your genitals/butt/pits/feet? I use soap on my genitals, but nowhere else. For my hair, conditioner only 1-2x weekly. I'm not the type of person to ever have stinky feet, FWIW. They just wouldn't get stinky unless I wore the same socks for 2 weeks straight. Do you use your hands, wash cloth, or other washing accessory? I use my hands only.  Do you use any oils? I use oils every now and then for cleaning my face. Do you use deodorant? I use a mineral salt spray deodorant which I make myself and this has made the biggest difference. When I used regular aluminum deodorant I always had problems with stinky sweaty pits and stained shirts, no matter what brand.   Now that I use the mineral salt spray, my pits actually smell good. This spray does not stop you from sweating, which I think is a good thing because it's a natural way to regulate body temperature. It does stop your sweat from stinking, however. Maybe it's all in my head, but it seems like my armpits sweat less now than they used to. Perhaps it's just that I don't mind sweating anymore.  My armpits don't ever stink anymore, I just spray them every morning and rinse every few days.   Can you provide more details on why you chose your routine?   Health reasons. Look up the ""hygiene hypothesis"" I don't believe that extreme cleanliness is necessary or healthy for me personally, because my immune system is very strong. I also brew and drink kombucha every day to add a bit of healthy bacteria into my diet.   I'm also not a fan of the artificial scents or perfumes added to what seems like everything these days. I don't find the need to give everything a ""pleasant scent."" I love the natural smell of my hair and skin. I think my house smells great cleaning with diluted vinegar and other mild unscented cleaners. I will never use Glade, Febreeze, Gain, or any other super-scented product EVER again. Once you remove these things from your home and adjust to the way things actually smell, ""added fragrance"" will irritate you and burn your nose. This is what I have experienced.  I also spend a lot less on hygiene products now and my skin is much softer, less dry, smells better overall. The same applies to my hair.   I'm very happy with my decision to lose the shampoo and majority cut down on my use of soap."

I was getting really bad dandruff and nothing seemed to be working. I found this subreddit and tried no-poo but that didn't work. I do low poo now which is much better.

NoPoo,30wjug,queenblackacid,1 point,Tue Mar 31 08:40:48 2015 UTC,"This is (obviously) more than 30 minutes later.  However, you can technically condition your hair at any time after dying it and still see benefits.  I'd recommend against using the conditioner that comes in the box with the dye, as it probably contains silicones.  Depending on your no-poo routine, you may have some trouble removing the silicone as you wash, which could lead to build-up later.  If you've already used the box conditioner, simply wash your hair once with ""normal"" shampoo, condition with a silicone-free conditioner or a natural oil, and then resume your normal no-poo routine.  If your hair is still dry later, you can use a silicone-free conditioner without too much trouble.  My personal favorite is Yes to Carrots nourishing conditioner.  However, there are a lot of options on the market that are mentioned throughout this subreddit.  If you don't want to use a store-bought conditioner, you can also use certain oils in your hair.  Coconut oil is very moisturizing, though it can leave hair heavy and greasy for a few days since it's hard to wash-out.  Certain other oils like jojoba, sweet almond, or even extra virgin olive (be careful, it can go rancid if not rinsed out properly) can also be used.  A little goes a long way!  There are recipes online for natural hair masks made out of things like avocado and other kitchen ingredients.  These have the benefit of rinsing-out easily, and being fairly inexpensive.  If your hair is feeling dry after a few days, try one of these!"

Then I use my BBB immediately after - spending about a minute brushing from my scalp to the end of my (short) hair in many small sections. This sectioning ensures that I am effectively brushing oils from my whole scalp through all of my hair. I do both of these before showering. When I shower I just use my fingers to scrub my scalp a bit more with the water and I'm done! No brushing after that for me.

And, letting my hair dry completely before I went to bed or put it up in a ponytail.  Those two in combination got rid of my dandruff, and it was really pretty bad before."

NoPoo,30qqaa,chickadoos,1 point,Mon Mar 30 16:50:28 2015 UTC,"Also, I should mention that there are apparently at least two kinds of dandruff; one is very dry flakes, and the other is more oily residue that you can scrape off your scalp with your fingernail.  I had the nasty oily kind.  Obviously they both suck, but they can have different causes and treatments.  So if you have really dry dandruff, what worked for me might not work for you"

NoPoo,30qqaa,Starfishwife,3,Mon Mar 30 20:14:41 2015 UTC,"Maybe you already do this,  but I brush my wet scalp thoroughly to loosen up the dry skin, which I then rinse out.  I'm not sure if dandruff is something specific or just dry skin flakes from your scalp, but brushing reduces my dry skin flakes  a lot."

NoPoo,30qja3,LouMcGopher,8,Sun Mar 29 21:11:02 2015 UTC,"If I get any waxy buildup in my hair I remove it with silicone-free conditioner. It ends up just like when I used to use shampoo, except with fewer flyaways. That's my experience though, YMMV.  I've been doing this for a long time, and I've tried high pH things like BS/ACV and castile soap, all-natural shampoo bars (beer!), and commercial silicone-free shampoos. It's been an interesting journey but I've settled on buying conditioner base in a 1L bottle for $8 and adding rosemary oil. My hair loves it, and any midweek greasiness can be fixed with a bit of dry shampoo."
NoPoo,30qja3,queenblackacid,6,Sun Mar 29 21:31:33 2015 UTC,"I've thought of doing a co-wash but I've heard you have to use A LOT of conditioner, and I don't want to use the cheapy stuff because of all the crap in it (hence why I'm looking for a less sketchy alternative to this shampoo). I'm not made of money so now that I'm buying commercial hair products again, I want to stretch it as far as humanly possible. But I'd be open to it if I wouldn't have to use that much after all. How long does a 1L bottle last you?"
NoPoo,30qja3,queenblackacid,6,Sun Mar 29 21:51:10 2015 UTC,"I do use a lot of conditioner, handfuls of it per use. But this $10/L bottle has lasted me 4 months so far and is still 1/3 full.  I generally wash once a week, but last week I skipped and stretched it to 2 weeks. Dry shampoo really helps around the roots but it is pricier than the conditioner."

NoPoo,30qja3,queenblackacid,1 point,Sun Mar 29 23:21:26 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to include: I make my own dry shampoo! I spent less than 10$ US on a box of cornstarch and  one of cocoa powder, mixed  1:1 in a mason jar. I Skritch, apply my mixture, then use my BBB to work through the roots. It's inexpensive, makes my hair smell yummy, and cuts the waxy feeling fantastically. I do have dark brown hair, so if you have lighter hair you may want to change the ratio, or drop the cocoa altogether. I've heard of similar results with arrowroot powder as well."
NoPoo,30qja3,RoboNona,1 point,Sat Apr 4 06:25:49 2015 UTC,I used to use cocoa powder for this but found that it works much better aerosolised. The alcohol probably helps too. When I run out I use cocoa until I feel the need to stock back up.

NoPoo,30qja3,queenblackacid,1 point,Sat Apr 4 14:29:43 2015 UTC,"For me personally, the cornstarch makes the dry shampoo ""spread"" a little easier, straight cocoa tends to clump in my hair, and would build up on my fingertips and BBB, since adding the cornstarch I have way less clumping and residue. I have heard you can scent the mixture with a few drops of essential oil, but haven't tried it."

There's a video example I've seen, but I don't quite remember where it is. I'm sure googling ""castille soap hard water"" will point you in the right direction.

When I use shampoo (which I've done twice or so since I started water only), my scalp goes back to normal after 2 days. The day after shampooing I wake up with greasy hair so I need a shower the next day which I usually don't (which I usually don't) , the next day it's already better, and on the third day it's like always.

NoPoo,30m0o5,badgradesboy,2,Sat Mar 28 16:37:46 2015 UTC,"I don't know about gel water, but I use gelatin + water as gel (there are recipes online, and they're very simple since you just mix the two, they don't last long though once mixed). To prevent dry hair, use moisturizer on the ends of your hair, such as avocado oil or argain oil, and of course don't wash your hair often. Preventing hair loss is trickier as it's mostly lifestyle and genetics that influence it; so avoiding stress, eating healthily (search hair supplements if you need it) are the two that I can think off that are the major factors."
NoPoo,30m0o5,OutstandingA,1 point,Sat Mar 28 21:39:01 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree,but oils don't moisturize ,they seal the moisture."

Even if you aren't curly, the CG method is along the same philosophy as no-poo, and is all about keeping your hair cared for properly, hydrated and natural regardless of texture. Insoluble ingredients like silicates don't dry your hair out, they prevent it from becoming properly hydrated, like each individual strand is covered in a sleeve of plastic wrap. As far as hair loss, product shouldn't really be affecting that, unless you're using something waxy near your scalp."

NoPoo,30j5oh,DanPearce,3,Fri Mar 27 20:43:24 2015 UTC,"Hi! I don't have answers to everything, but let's hope this helps.   The ""greasy hair"" stage depends on people's hair history, texture and general skin characteristics, but you could prepare for maybe two weeks of really greasy locks and then one or two more months until it completely settles. In that time, you'll learn how to take care of your hair, spread the oil, water-wash well if you want to extend time between two ""shampoos"" (with eggs, BS, whatever). I am now about six months in and can go 7-10 days without anything but water, but three months in, this was 4 days at most. It's a slow process, though rewarding. BS is really effective : prepare it well and use it well, and most people's hair comes out squeaky clean. However, its efficacy has a price, and that it that it might dry / weaken some hair and scalp types. This isn't the case for everyone, and i've read people here using baking soda for months or years. I personally dont, because it pulls the henna from my hair and dries my scalp, but I have very dry skin to start with.  No pictures, but from limited experience (this may only apply to me, watch out!) : baking soda leaves hair fluffy and dry, it's also the most ""predictable"" result (always the same hair texture after use, like shampoo). Honey shampoos (honey dissolved in warm water) leave hair feeling a bit thicker, but they need to be massaged in really well to have an effect on the root oil. Egg shampoos are my favorite - just mix one or two eggs, apply on hair, leave on for ten minutes and rinse. They leave my hair feeling very thick and bouncy (but not fluid).  Hair types I've never understood - however, one thing I can advise you is to figure out whether your hair needs more protein or moisture. You can choose your best routine + use of natural conditionner, or not, based on this.    There might be a looooot of hit-and-miss involved, but it's like your inner child is playing with food products on their head, so enjoy the ride! :)"
NoPoo,30j5oh,leech4,1 point,Fri Mar 27 21:13:12 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend gradually weaning yourself off shampoo. If you shampoo every day, switch to doing it every second day for a week, then every third day, then fourth, etc. That should minimise the problem of it getting too greasy, and you probably have some shampoo left that you'd otherwise just have to throw out.   Only thing I've tried is ACV, which has the problem of making me smell like vinegar. Women have a more sensitive sense of smell than men, so that might be an option that's only viable for women or very rare men. Otherwise I just do water only.  If my hair grows too long I get some problems again, so regularly keeping it cut short helps. If you keep short hair anyway, no big deal. If you want longer hair, you might have to look at other options."
NoPoo,30hqau,clygreen,9,Fri Mar 27 14:06:40 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't switch to white wine vinegar, as that's more acidic than apple cider vinegar and often too strong for people. Your scalp will recover in due time, as long as you don't continue to irritate it. I would recommend washing your hair as least often as you're comfortable with to give it as much ""natural"" time as possible.  You may also consider doing a hair mask with Aloe Vera, the raw stuff. It's amazing for scalp conditioning and has a lot of great healing properties. Rub it in your scalp, leave it on for twenty minutes, then wash as you regularly would. Doing this once every couple weeks is ideal.  It will all work out : )"
NoPoo,30hqau,occidentalis,3,Fri Mar 27 14:21:41 2015 UTC,"Okay, thanks for the advice! I had been reading a lot of mixed reviews for white vinegar, so that's good to know.  I'll try that! I have been hearing good things about using coconut oil for conditioning too! So I'll look around and see if I can find anything!  Thanks so much for all the good info! Soon my hair/scalp will be healthy as ever!"
NoPoo,30hqau,occidentalis,2,Fri Mar 27 14:44:49 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't use coconut oil if you're using BS/ACV, as it's a bit ""too"" much and is difficult to wash out with a nopoo routine. Some people say egg yolks wash out the coconut oil well, but I have't found success with it, really. Stick to the Aloe for your scalp for now.  Remember, it's always a good idea to introduce one thing at a time rather than multiple. You'll be able to find how things affect you more accurately. Give each ""addition"" or ""subtraction"" to your routine at least two weeks to see the real affect.  Good luck!"

Is what you explained all you've done?"
NoPoo,30hoj7,occidentalis,2,Fri Mar 27 14:25:31 2015 UTC,"I think that's it--the excessive ACV. At least, right now, that's what I can think of to be a glaring error in this process.

NoPoo,30hoj7,ammolite,2,Fri Mar 27 18:17:18 2015 UTC,"Do you have hard water?  If you have hard water, your hair will begin to feel sticky and waxy the longer you use BS.  (I discovered this while on vacation last summer.)  It may also mean that WO washing will be harder for you.  It's also possible that BS/ACV isn't a good method for you.  Some people with thick, wavy hair do better with CO washing.  You could also try methods like natural soap/shampoo bars and ACV, honey washing, rye flour, or mud/clay.    Some people just have oilier scalps than others.  I'm 10 months into no-poo (I use diluted castile soap to wash, ACV to condition), and my hair still gets oily in 3-5 days.  I've tried WO washing every day, and I've tried going a few days between wetting my hair.  Neither makes a huge difference.  I know I have oily skin, so I assume that extends to my scalp."
NoPoo,30hoj7,ammolite,2,Fri Mar 27 17:15:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if I have hard water. But I could probably figure out without too much trouble. For now I'm going to address the problematic ACV washing I was doing (ie, wasn't diluting the ACV). If the problem persists, I think i'm going to try Co-washing next. I saw a cleansing conditioner at Target yesterday. I don't remember what it was called. But it described itself as a non-lathering, no shampoo, cleansing conditioner. So far the only cleansing conditioner I ever hear about is the diva curl shampoo but I don't have curly hair so I don't want to use that stuff. Thank you for your input!"
NoPoo,30hoj7,RoboNona,1 point,Fri Mar 27 18:07:45 2015 UTC,"Depending on where you live, your water department may have the local PH on their website, or available if you call them.  Really hard water is obvious, as you'll have a lot of white build-up around your faucets and shower heads.  Be careful with ""cleansing conditioners.""  Some still have ingredients which can be harsh on your hair and scalp.  You actually don't need a specific ""cleansing"" conditioner - You can use any silicone-free conditioner on the market.  Suave Naturals are an inexpensive option.  My personal favorite is Yes to Carrots nourishing conditioner. While it costs more than Suave, a little goes a long way!"

I find that WO with the occasional egg cleanse keeps my hair at its best. As for the smell, I feel patchouli does the best to cover the sebum smell since it is earthy. Hope that helps!"
NoPoo,307lb5,meecharoni,1 point,Wed Mar 25 03:12:54 2015 UTC,"Have you tried shikakai and/or aritha powder? I've gone no-poo as well, and wash my hair with the powders (make a thin solution and scrub your hair with it right before you get into the shower). It's available in Indian stores for a couple $$ less than than on Amazon (brand name Hesh or Ayur). Women in India have used this instead of shampoo for generations. You may have to find some way to condition your hair (I have some more flyaways than normal), but your hair will feel clean and fresh for sure. I'm not sure about smell, though I have to say that my husband says my hair smells natural and clean and fresh... hope this helps!"
NoPoo,307k1d,DeviatedDaylight,3,Wed Mar 25 02:33:37 2015 UTC,"It's hard to recommend one without knowing anything about the length, texture, thickness, etc of your hair.        As a quick side note, you've got a fairly large budget for one so even if you go outside of Amazon and pay for shipping you could still come in well under your price range.         From my small amount of research the two brands that seem to get mentioned the most are the top of the line, very expensive Mason Pearson brand that will last years and Denman brushes that are very affordable and good quality. I have not used either of these brands so can't comment. A lot of people just buy ones at their local grocery or pharmacy store and say they work fine too.        I ended up buying this one. This came in a clear bag and no other packaging like one might expect so I was a little leery. This company also has brushes that are nylon or a boar / nylon combo and I was worried they may have sent me the wrong one. Also, there was a review from a person claiming their brush was not 100% boar. I pulled out three different types of bristles from the brush and did the ""light it on fire"" test. Basically if it burns (as opposed to melting) it's real and not synthetic. All 3 bristles burned and I also tested bristles from a different nylon brush I own and those melted.             The brush handle is plastic. I was expecting better quality for the price I paid when it came to this. It's made fine but I worry how long it will hold up in the long run.            The bristles are spaced widely enough apart that I can actually brush my hair just fine and it pulls through nicely. The bristles are hard and sharp though. You have to be careful not to apply too much pressure or brush for too long because your scalp will feel it and can become a bit sore.          This brush would be good for shoulder length hair or longer that is about medium thickness or more. One of the hassles of BBB is that you have to section your hair to brush it which takes time. I don't need to do that with this one as it all goes right through. If you have heavy thick hair you'll still need to section but not as much as some other brushes out there. If you have short or fine, thin hair I would pass on this brush as it would be overkill and overpriced for what you need.   After I brush, my hair looks like it's gelled down to my head with oil. Just run your fingers through your hair a few times to break it up and then it looks great. Overall I'm happy with the brush. When it needs to be replaced I'm probably going to try the cheaper Denman to see how it compares.             I also bought a brush to clean my brush. I know this sounds stupid but glad I did as it makes cleaning it much easier. I went with this one but there are cheaper ones out there and other types too.              I also picked up a $5 Conair brand BBB from my local store. The bristles are much softer and easier on my scalp. I can only brush a small section at a time though. Hair definitely has to be tangle free though as the bristles aren't going to help work those out at all. I use this one more if I'm just looking to do the top layer quickly."
NoPoo,30303o,imbedderdanu,9,Tue Mar 24 01:29:08 2015 UTC,As in there is dimethicone in the ingredients list of your coconut oil?? This should definitely be avoided. Find a pure source of coconut oil to use instead.
NoPoo,30303o,justcallmedoge,4,Tue Mar 24 02:06:28 2015 UTC,You generally want to avoid things with silicones (which often end with -cone) as they won't wash out without a harsh shampoo. It should be relatively easy to find pure coconut oil at a grocery store.
NoPoo,30303o,purple_cats,3,Tue Mar 24 04:17:45 2015 UTC,Dimethicone is that silicone that they put in skin protectants like Gold Bond lotions. It leaves you with that coated slick feeling. Definitely not something you want on your hair if you're not using sulfates to wash it out.
NoPoo,3031p1,lavastoviglie,3,Tue Mar 24 01:42:04 2015 UTC,"Try using rye flour as an alternative to baking soda. I found it was as cleaning as baking soda, perhaps more so, but it isn't damaging. Just mix it into a slurry with water and apply to your roots like you do with baking soda."
NoPoo,3031p1,justcallmedoge,1 point,Tue Mar 24 02:04:50 2015 UTC,This is what I do.   I have had success boiling the heck out of rye flakes and using the liquid too if you want to wash more often.
NoPoo,3031p1,Starfishwife,1 point,Tue Mar 24 05:01:06 2015 UTC,What does boiling it do?
NoPoo,3031p1,Starfishwife,1 point,Tue Mar 24 06:22:09 2015 UTC,"If you use rye flakes (it's just like oatmeal, but coarser), you need to boil it first because just mixing it with water doesn't extract the good stuff.   I like this mostly because when you're in the shower, it's much much faster to pour some of the stuff onto your head, work it in and rinse it out. Rye flour slurry takes more time to wash out."
NoPoo,3031p1,Starfishwife,2,Tue Mar 24 06:26:24 2015 UTC,Can you store pre-boiled rye flakes in a bottle or is it better if it's boiled right before the shower?

NoPoo,2zy1pn,tamandua,2,Sun Mar 22 23:19:27 2015 UTC,"That, I can't answer. I have heard that it helps if the dandruff has a fungal cause. I use it as a hair rinse after using jr liggetts shampoo bar to remove build up caused by the product mixing with hard water (or something like that that reddit told me). So, I don't really use it on my scalp specifically. Just chimed in because I'm tired of hearing about how stinky ACV is."

NoPoo,2zy1pn,Qbuilderz,7,Mon Mar 23 18:38:52 2015 UTC,"Had this happen, too. I was freaking out! The solution for me was simple, and already mentioned -- I do the baking soda / vinegar rinse every time I go back home for college-breaks. So, once every two or 3 months, then water only the rest of the time.  Also, clean your brush well -- really cuts back the amount over time.  As for the smell; yes. Your kitchen will reek for two hours, and your hair will smell like vinegar, but only while it's wet (and when you get it wet again for a few showers after.) As long as you aren't planning on swimming within the next three days, you'll be fine, and nobody will know."
NoPoo,2zy1pn,dreams_or_reality,2,Mon Mar 23 00:28:53 2015 UTC,I'll have to try that then. Do I lather it into my scalp like shampoo?
NoPoo,2zy1pn,dreams_or_reality,3,Mon Mar 23 00:50:59 2015 UTC,"Alrighty;  Baking Soda part of it -- massage your head gently, and deeply, for a few minutes. It doesn't foam or bubble, but your hair should feel slick by the time you rinse it out. I usually rub it in for about two minutes, then let it sit for a little bit. Rinse when you're ready!  I keep a comb in the shower, so I comb my hair out a bit at this point.  Vinegar part -- Same thing, work it in well, but actually pay attention to get it all the way along your hair. I personally like to let this one sit for a while. Read some shampoo bottles, listen to music, etc. Rinse out very well after you're ready.  Honestly, its super easy, and even though its breifly smelly, your hair will feel so soft afterwards. There are a whole bunch of herbs and stuff listed in the side bar that I used in mine; I personally enjoy mint or lavender to cover up the vinegar smell."
NoPoo,2zy1pn,sellyberry,4,Mon Mar 23 01:03:24 2015 UTC,"I started getting dandruff when I tried to go water only so the way I deal with this now is once a week I will massage oil into my scalp, I rub it in until my arms ache, then I wait for about 20 minutes and then wash it out in fairly warm water.

NoPoo,2zwcvb,scottymtp,3,Sun Mar 22 12:33:23 2015 UTC,I stopped using soap about three weeks ago. No problem with smell. Its still winter here in Norway though. I also dont scrub my skin.
NoPoo,2zwcvb,eirik124,2,Sun Mar 22 16:06:27 2015 UTC,Hmm I'm only lightly scrubbing because another thread here on nosoap mostly everyone said you need to use something other than your hands to remove dirt since soap won't be emulsifying it.
NoPoo,2zwcvb,OriginalName75,2,Sun Mar 22 16:25:00 2015 UTC,"I've been going no soap for close to 6 months now. I occasionally test soaps that my mom finds that she thinks are good (she knows how picky I am about my soap) but I usually don't like them (they make my skin feel tacky? on touch, and I'd rather just not use soap). I've only told 3 or 4 people about my no soap habits. They were interested in my thoughts about toxics all over the place. But other than that, nobody has ever said that I smell bad, even in mildly sweaty conditions, so as I see it, if you don't smell bad, why do we have the need to ""freshen up"" and spray tons of fragrances and shit all over our body?  Though we're moving into summer here in Missouri, so we'll see what the 90℉ and 95% humidity brings."
NoPoo,2zwcvb,OriginalName75,1 point,Sun Mar 22 17:48:58 2015 UTC,Oh wow 6 months is quite a while. Any breakouts on your face?
NoPoo,2zwcvb,allltogethernow,3,Sun Mar 22 18:16:38 2015 UTC,Not any more than previously. If anything I'm sure not dousing my face with chemicals and being more conscious about my diet (quit soda) has actually improved it.
NoPoo,2zwcvb,allltogethernow,2,Sun Mar 22 18:41:40 2015 UTC,"I don't really scrub; like everyone, skin falls of imperceptivally during the day/night, and there is no real benefit to scraping off skin during a shower other than to irritate it. The outer layer of skin is a constant conveyer belt and when you force it to exfoliate you're basically trying to push the belt to make it go faster.    It's still winter time here, so smell hasn't been a problem at all, even with reduced showering (low sebum production). However I feel like I'll have to rinse off more when it warms up and I start to sweat more."
NoPoo,2zwcvb,allltogethernow,2,Sun Mar 22 15:33:14 2015 UTC,How often do you shower?
NoPoo,2zwcvb,introvrt2themax,3,Sun Mar 22 16:24:13 2015 UTC,"Varies from once every three days to about once a week. Never wear undershirts more than once, cause they accumulate oil, especially from the pits. I've been told I smell like clean laundry. Also, about your comment on dirt: what dirt? 99% of what's on my skin cones from inside my body. It's oil, dead skin, and bacteria."
NoPoo,2zwcvb,introvrt2themax,2,Sun Mar 22 17:06:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the response. Are you male or female?    I definitely don't think I could last 1 day without showering! I'm currently in Africa and work outside a lot, but even back stateside with going to the gym almost every day I feel like all my sweat would stink and require me to wash my sheets every day.    I don't have much dirt. I'll probably just rub my body with hands as that is whats I've always done with soap. Just seemed most No Soap routines advocated using a wash cloth."
NoPoo,2zwcvb,u2412m,2,Sun Mar 22 18:13:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah a rinse is definitely good after a good sweat, but I would probably scrub even less if I knew it was just a bit of sweat; there's nothing that wouldn't rinse off really easily, and the bacteria will eat most of the nutrients in the sweat regardless. The problem only comes when things start to FERMENT on your skin, which happens after a few days. Studies have been done that seem to hint at the fact that people generally (not everyone) like the smell of a little bit of ""work"", but that it quickly becomes foul when the nutrients ferment on the skin, and then you get into homeless dude territory. I'm a guy. And I may start using a washcloth, it's just that you would probably have to use soap to clean the washcloth regularly; much easier to wash your hands! I find I have to clean my shower pretty regularly though, as bacteria/oil can accumulate on the bottom after a shower."
NoPoo,2zwcvb,zahrahuss,2,Mon Mar 23 00:11:57 2015 UTC,"I started no soap a couple of weeks ago, and so far it's going well.  Since I'm still transitioning on NoPoo/WO, I'm taking showers every other day (ideally, I'd like to only need them twice a week).  No problem with smell so far; I carry a travel size Purell in my purse for emergency deodorant use at work, but otherwise I've been using witch hazel or coconut oil after showering to cut any odors off at the pass.  I also use a coconut oil/Vitamin E mix if my face needs any moisturizing (I live in the desert, so it's generally necessary).  Just a dab here and there, rub gently and I'm good to go.  I did start out scrubbing with a wash cloth during my showers, but recently came upon some articles stating using your hands and water was sufficient and better for the skin.  I keep a small bar soap in my shower just in case I end up with actual dirt on me (from gardening, fall in mud puddle, etc.), but haven't needed it yet.  If I need it, it's there and I'll use my hands to lather up.  I started with hot showers, but have been lowering the temp a little bit each time and now I'm basically at lukewarm (I feel a very slight chill while showering). I've heard of great benefits for skin and hair when using cold showers; I just don't have the guts for those quite yet."
NoPoo,2zxk2j,nopoolurker,2,Sun Mar 22 19:31:36 2015 UTC,You could try putting argan oil in your hair after you shower. I apply it to the ends of my long hair every 2-3 days. I use this product. It seems expensive but one bottle has lasted me about 2 years.

It is generally a more natural way to remove hair dye, although it can take a few applications to achieve noticeable results. The honey she added to the mixture also has a stripping and lightening quality due to the small amounts of hydrogen peroxide that is in honey.  From what I've read, most people don't suggest using this method too many times consecutively. Some people do 3 or 4 Vitamin C applications and space them out over 4-6 weeks."

NoPoo,2zuc4o,druggad,3,Sat Mar 21 21:17:46 2015 UTC,"Haha! I was right about to make my own post and we're in a very similar situation (except my hair is long). I have re-occurring dry scalp as well, and while the scalp thing doesn't really bother me that much, as long as I do a little upkeep daily the flakes aren't as noticeable as they used to be before I went WO, but it DOES seem to affect the hair itself.    By that I mean, I think the hair being produced at the scalp level is actually coming out ""drier"" or frizzier, at least in my case, when my scalp is dry. Would you consider yourself to be a pretty chill person? Do you have a lot of stress? I believe one culprit for my dryness is stress, as I also get dryness in my T-zone that's hard to get rid of.    Also I'm curious how much you brush/comb your hair. I sometimes have good results when I pay extra attention to grooming, sometimes not.    Hard water might be an issue for me here, too, but I can't really do anything about it. I've heard the shower heads don't really do much. A lot of people seem to be attributing their hair problems to hard water when it's really just the products they're using. There's so much misinformation out there about no-poo/WO, it's kind of hard to really know what's working/what's not.    One last note: I find that experiences are extremely subjective here. Different types of hair evolved for different climates, and probably have very different composition/needs, so there is no single solution that will apply to everyone. Also, there are tons of variables, so sometimes experimentation is basically the only route. Trial and error. Good luck!"

Their apartment must have had a water softener because my hair felt great after showering and my flakes pretty much disappeared.  I almost never comb or brush my hair, except a little with my fingers when I style it (without product).  The New York experience has made me think that it really is hard water that is affecting my scalp.  If I end up buying a shower head, I'll make a post to review it."

You don't have to keep your arms up as high (which is exhausting), you don't have to switch hand positions, and with a mirror you can see what you are doing the entire time.  A few tricks:   Get strands of hair as close to the braid as possible. Keep close to your head. Frequently run your hair along the braid sections to keep them as smooth as possible. If you mess up, keep going. You would be amazed at what can be easily fixed with bobby pins. Some of my best braids are ones that I made a ton of mistakes with and fixed later with pins. Check your neck with your pinky finger occasionally to make sure you aren't leaving little strands behind. You can twist your wrist, sort of, to fix loose sections and bumps as you braid. You'll understand what I mean as you practice. If your braid is messy when you finish, gently tug on the outside of each little braid section to give it a deliberately messy boho look.  Braids get infinitely easier with muscle memory. When you first practice it can be really frustrating because your arms get tired and you forget which strand goes next or whether it goes on the top or the bottom and even when you get it there is this random piece that didn't braid in quite right and all that stuff. Every single person who has ever braided, even the ones with those gorgeous braids that are so complex that the person who did them had to make up a new name for it, has been there many, many times. Eventually if you do it enough, your hands remember, and you can see the whole braid rather than each individual movement.   Edited for readability."

NoPoo,2zq16c,jaywatson,3,Fri Mar 20 17:56:56 2015 UTC,"Things don't always become popular because they work. They usually become popular because of clever advertising. They have done such a good job too. The idea of ditching shampoo easily brings to mind dirty, smelly, ugly people. It's ingrained as a part of your daily routine, right? I can guarantee you wouldn't even notice that I don't use shampoo or soap. Yes I said or soap. Think about what soap/shampoo actually does and the chemistry behind it. It simply removes oils and gives you a chemical smell. It doesn't really remove dirt, bacteria, or sweat per say. This is all mostly done with water and some friction. I smell completely fine, 3rd party verified. I don't create buckets of sebum (oil) so again there is no reason to strip it at all. Personally I don't use ACV because I don't get really much of any production of oil. I might use it once a month at most. This is different for others obviously, just hold off until you actually need it. I would even get a boar bristle brush and try that before using ACV. My hair also was kinda frizzy and coarse, It flattened for me. I'm guessing because it wasn't so dry any more. My hair also never looked or felt oily when I started Nopoo, like not at all. This obviously isn't the same for everyone but I was surprised."
NoPoo,2zq16c,schemn,2,Mon Mar 23 15:33:04 2015 UTC,"NoPoo is not a one size fits all program. I WO wash using this method. I also supplement using an all natural sulfate free shampoo. A 100% natural boar bristle brush is a must, but since you have short hair you can save some money and get a comb.   Your hair is likely to get pretty greasy when you first start. Normally when you use shampoo, you strip away all of the natural oils, and so so your scalp tries to regulate by producing more. Once you are out of transition, your scalps oil production will have mellowed out, and it will be much easier.   I have long thick hair and this works for me."

Also, as someone else said, a BBB is not for detangling. It's for redistributing oil from your scalp into the length of your hair. It's very good for keeping your hair moisturized, but not too oily at the scalp."
NoPoo,2zo6v6,lannawho,2,Fri Mar 20 13:23:39 2015 UTC,"A BBB is not designed to detangle  hair, only to detangle the hair and redistribute oil.

NoPoo,2zo6v6,queenblackacid,2,Sun Mar 22 04:00:45 2015 UTC,"The Boar Bristles grab oil and pull it down the hair to the dryer ends, making the roots less oily and moisturizing the ends.  I recommend working in sections on already untangled hair before washing.   You also need to properly car for the brush, washing the old oils off, but try not to get the rest of the brush too wet or the bristles will fall out."

NoPoo,2zfggz,blutenbaum,1 point,Wed Mar 18 12:06:41 2015 UTC,"It has only been a month, so if you have previous damage on your hair it might still show as damaged hair cannot really be repaired. It also might just be the way your hair naturally is, but it might be possible to combat the dryness by properly moisturizing the hair and sealing it well as well as doing other basic things (which you might know but I can tell you more if you wonder!). Also, sweat is water-soluble so you can just rinse it out if you want and condition lightly afterwards. Something that also helps me with the smell is if you ""air out"" your hair properly, preferrably not with a dryer as it obviously is drying but perhaps outside, just sort of ""shaking it out"" properly. But of course, the effects of this isn't long lasting. :-))"

NoPoo,2zg0ga,jeremyvaught,2,Thu Mar 19 08:14:02 2015 UTC,"I tried this once and it is always suggested here. However there are a lot of reports that after a while it has bad effects on hair leaving it really brittle, due to baking soda being very strongly alkaline. For this reason I think it is a risky treatment to get into.  My solution has been to find an SLS free shampoo and put a drop of pure tea tree oil into a tablespoon of shampoo before using it. Massage the shampoo into your scalp and leave it for about 10 minutes. I've had good results with this, the shampoo I use is from Louise Galvin. Tea tree oil has a good history of treating dandruff but it can irritate the skin so be careful to use very little."

NoPoo,2ze9ne,damncheese,5,Tue Mar 17 21:22:26 2015 UTC,After 3 months of water only you've trained your scalp to produce less oil. Using shampoo once isn't going to put you back at square 1 but continuing to strip the oils will make your head start producing more again.

Coat your wet hair in shampoo, then do your other shower things. At the end, maybe add just a splash of water, then scrub your scalp like you would if you were using shampoo. If you've done it right, you should have tiny bubbles on your hands when you pull them away from your hair. Then rinse."

Try leaving the roots out next time and see if that does anything for you. Other wise it could be a styling product you're using.   Otherwise it might be another issue, could be psoriasis, dry weather, etc."

NoPoo,2z1dm7,VSilas,1 point,Sat Mar 14 17:46:56 2015 UTC,"No. You can use these methods if you want to normalize the oil production of your scalp of if shampoos are giving you problems (such as dry itchy scalp, splitting hairs). The thing that makes shampoos, shower gels etc lather is a detergent that is too harsh for hair, be it curly or not. You strip all the oils with it from your scalp, then put some back with conditioner. But that's not enough and scalp starts overproducing oil. It's better not to take away all the oil in the first place. You can see in the sidebar  that there are a lot of methods, water only(WO) being the most hardcore and baking soda (BS+ACV) the easiest one. Soda is not perfect in the long run but it's better then shampoo."

By using other methods, hair will look awesomer/have vitality/not be so dependant on washing everyday. Washing everyday=super oil excretion by the scalp, so going no poo helps the scalp chillout on the intense oil production = lively mane"

First things first, check out the side bar and read the no-poo beginner guides. That's a good place to start.   In terms of how I started:  My hair is just below boob length and I work as a lifeguard. I'm not in the water every day but chlorine is extremely drying… coupled with the humidity of the pool I was greasier than you could imagine. Washing every day, which sucks big time… also stripped the colour straight out of my hair.  I started shampooing just my scalp with a Dove shampoo, then conditioning and using coconut oil as an after-treatment. When I found no-poo was a real thing I went cold-turkey on the shampoo, using a baking soda and vinegar mixture in its place. Now I'm onto water only, which keeps my colour looking amazing.   Couple of things to be mindful of:   Read the ingredients of products. Don't buy anything with ingredients ending in -cone because they don't wash out easily.  get a boar-bristle brush (~$10 at Sallys)  Look for products that are vegan or natural (Ion has some good vegan hairsprays, Aveda's products are all natural, etc.). I find they wash out much nicer.  If you need a dry shampoo, try corn starch.  After you start no-poo you gotta deal with the grease for awhile. Try going at LEAST 3 days between washes. You're gonna have to learn to love hats, dry shampoo and buns.    Good luck :)"

NoPoo,2yy8kj,jen-sa,3,Fri Mar 13 20:55:38 2015 UTC,"A table spoon of baking soda diluted in a cup of water is a good place to start. It's not ideal, because it's damaging for hair in the long run, but better then shampoo. People report a transitional period with baking soda while their scalp adjusts. I didn't have any though, it cleaned everything just fine and was the only thing that enabled me to go longer between washes from the get go.  If you have patience, water only (WO) is the best way to go, it'll help you cut back oil production. But you'll have to spend a lot of time in a beanie during the transition period, plus, you being 15, part of you problem is hormones, so your hair might still end up overproducing oil anyway. I have no personal experience WO it but there's a link to a good tutorial in the sidebar.  Among other alternatives are clay, rhy flour, egg yolk and honey. The latter two probably won't be enough to wash all the oil, but they can be used as occasional help for WO method. In regards to hard water - watever method you use you can condition with an AVC rinse, it's acidic and will make the water softer.  If you think your scalp is too dry, look into oil masks - you can do them before you wash you hair. Or, if your hair is thick and you can get away with it, rub a few drops of oil into the scalp right after washing. It might sound counter intuitive, but the idea is to provide the scalp with the oil it needs so that it doesn't have to go into overproduction.  Also, eat less sugary things. It'll help.  You'll have to try out different things and see what works best for you. Good luck experimenting :)"

NoPoo,2yy8kj,PawnStarRick,2,Sat Mar 14 01:24:36 2015 UTC,How about using conditioner to wash?  This won't strip your hair of grease and then your scalp will slowly rebalance.  This is known as CO washing.
NoPoo,2yyjx3,cleeder,2,Fri Mar 13 22:24:39 2015 UTC,"Any repetitive tension you put on your hair, (brushing, running hands through hair in the same place constantly, a tight pony) will cause traction alopecia, which is just hair breakage/loss from constant stress on the hair strands.   Detangle just at the ends, and massage your scalp gently to distribute the natural oils from your scalp to the midshaft and ends of your hair.   Basically just keep midshaft and ends hydrated as much as possible, while avoid excess tension and stress to your hair in general.  Are short hairs that are sticking up very course or dry? New hair is constantly growing in, but if you have noticed it recently then something has changed that has caused either breakage or frizz/course hair"
NoPoo,2yyjx3,branmar,1 point,Sat Mar 14 04:12:26 2015 UTC,"I think you're right in that the excess brushing causes a lot of breakage. I also noticed that happening on my hair, which was especially shitty since the rest of my hair goes down to my butt.   I don't have any spectacular advice, but I've kind of stopped using my BBB and just used dry shampoo until my scalp stopped producing excess oil. In all honesty, that took six months. I would suggest conditioning regularly with non-silicone conditioner and using argan oil on your ends. And just be super gentle when brushing your hair normally."
NoPoo,2yyjx3,ForeverMadrone,-3,Sat Mar 14 02:42:54 2015 UTC,I've been WO for half a year. I would strongly recommend a BBB and using it before you shower and against the scalp. Blow drying is also key as it gets rid of the oil.
NoPoo,2yyjx3,thesharpener,5,Fri Mar 13 23:06:34 2015 UTC,"As I mentioned in my post, I have a BBB and use it regularly. I don't think I'll be taking up blow drying though. I don't use any heat styling on my hair, and I don't see how that would ""get rid"" of the oil anyway. Oil will/wax not evaporate with heat.  Edit: It occurs to me that what you are probably experiencing with blow drying is the opening of the cuticles on your hair. This will create an uneven surface that will not refract light the same as a closed cuticle, thus giving the appearance of being less oily. However, an open cuticle is more prone to damage. I know I'm not really in a position to give advice on your W.O. hair care given my current W.O. failure, but I would probably recommend cutting out the blow dryer from your routine. Blow drying your hair isn't healthy with more traditional hair care, and I suspect it isn't any healthier when doing W.O."

Wet your hair, put a small amount in your hand, work it WELL into your scalp and then ""pull"" through your hair.  Let it sit for 1-2 min and rinse clean.  No need to repeat.  You can use it as often as you need.  Some people use it daily (me) and others use it as infrequently as once a month or so.

I missed a patch the first time I used a cleansing conditioner because I had a hard time getting the product all over my scalp. You might want to flip your head right over to get enough product on the underside of your hair. Massage it in with the pads of your fingertips and not your nails.  I leave mine in for more than 5 minutes, closer to 15, just to really let the conditioner work its magic and get rid of all that grease. I think at least 5 minutes is a good rule of thumb, but everyone is different.  You can cleanse your hair whenever you feel like it. You might want to start out cleansing daily and then stretch it out to about 2-3 times a week as your hair adjusts to this new product."
NoPoo,2yqsre,spongesbroom,2,Thu Mar 12 01:05:28 2015 UTC,"Dry shampoo generally doesn't contain sulfates. While normal shampoo washes the hair and dissolves oils, dry shampoos aim to absorb oils.    Aluminium starch octenylsuccinate - study on pubmed says that tests found it safe to use in cosmetics.  Isobutane - propellant. Releases into the atmosphere.  Isopropyl myristate - synthetic alcohol. Possible weak irritant but okay in small amounts.  Cyclopentasiloxane - Silicone. This is a no-no if you don't use shampoo."
NoPoo,2yqsre,queenblackacid,1 point,Thu Mar 12 04:42:33 2015 UTC,Thank you so much! Do you have any idea if the batiste dry shampoo is nopoo approved? Or any dry shampoo for that matter.
NoPoo,2yqsre,queenblackacid,2,Thu Mar 12 23:48:03 2015 UTC,"No problem. I personally wouldn't use the Batiste one due to the heavy fragrances (parfum, limonene, linalool, geraniol) and some Batiste products have added colour.  In terms of no-poo, these are the things you want to look for:   No sulfates. Popular sulfates are sodium laureth sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate, ammonium sulfate. No silicones. Anything ending in -cone or -xane have to be avoided if shampoo containing sulfates is not being used, UNLESS it has PEG in front of it. That means it is water soluble and can be used. For example, dimethicone and cyclopentasiloxane must be avoided, but PEG dimethicone or PEG cyclopentasiloxane can be used. Be wary of anything high in mineral oil or paraffin. Whilst these are usually totally fine for hair, they only wash out with shampoo.   I use Nourish dry shampoo. I previously have used pure cocoa powder due to my dark brown hair and only switched to an aerosol product because I'm lazy. Others in this sub with lighter hair have used arrowroot powder effectively. Some could argue that this would work better for our uses, considering that dry shampoos always contain alcohol which dries the scalp, leading to your scalp producing more sebum to compensate."

NoPoo,2yn6sm,throwaway33434,7,Wed Mar 11 05:34:16 2015 UTC,"Hello! How often do you swim in chlorinated pools?   I have a few recommendations. The obvious being 1) swim cap (but yeah, they're ugly and I refuse unless I'm swimming super often) 2) find a salt-water pool. Salt water pools are great because they leave the hair feeling amazing! However, these aren't easy to find.   So what I usually do, because I only swim in the summer now, is rinse my hair very well with fresh water in the pool showers before getting in the pool. Wet hair cannot absorb more from the environment so it usually prevents lots of chlorine from doing too much damage. Then, rinse your hair again with fresh water immediately after getting out. The problem with chlorine is that is totally strips the beautiful natural oils you've been working so hard at maintaining throughout the hair. Every once in awhile, it's fine, you wont totally destroy your hair. If you're a regular swimmer (year round, more than once a week), then either do the swim cap (ugh) or find a sulfate-free shampoo and silicone-free conditioner. Unfortunately, no-poo does not work for every lifestyle.   But for myself, the double rinse works great. I swim all summer! If my hair feels too dry I apply coconut oil to the ends. I also like to braid my hair in the summer to prevent it from sticking to my neck, so I'm not doing glamorous updos or anything. Does this answer your question? Mostly, just try not to worry so much. :)"
NoPoo,2yn6sm,lannawho,3,Wed Mar 11 16:12:59 2015 UTC,"I used to lifeguard at a waterpark. I'd just come home and immediately do an acv rinse. The chlorine in the water is alkaline, so just get everything rinsed out and then bring your hair back to a better acidity and you should be fine. I had to keep moisturizing my hair, but that's because I was working there four days a week and I'd have to get my hair wet almost every time."
NoPoo,2yn6sm,tahsties,9,Wed Mar 11 14:18:59 2015 UTC,In your experience do you find that hairdressers are accepting of nopoo? I've been at it for almost a year and the two times I've used shampoo were when I went in for haircuts and they washed my hair. As much as I don't want to compromise the awesome head massages I'd rather not have them use shampoo; have you ever asked one about it?
NoPoo,2yn6sm,tahsties,7,Wed Mar 11 05:07:40 2015 UTC,"Hello there! I don't get my hair cut too often, but I usually ask for a dry cut. Tell them you do not use product in your hair, including shampoo/conditioner. I had one hairdresser that was quite rude, she didn't understand why I was refusing her ""ultra-technology infused"" (what a load of crap) products. I basically just told her if I was going to pay her to do my hair, she needed to do a dry cut or I'd go somewhere else.   My hairdresser now is great. He doesn't use shampoo either! He loves the condition of my hair and does a splendid layer cut for me every 3-4 months. They are out there, you just have to be picky. Commercial places (Great Clips, Supercuts, etc) aren't the greatest to find a regular hairdresser you can trust with your shampoo-free head.   The exception of course is hair dye. If you get your hair colored, there is NO WAY to remove all of the excess color from your head except with shampoo. So you'll have to cave and do so. Or not color your hair. Unfortunately with no-poo, you can't get the best of both worlds scenario. Synthetic hair-changing chemicals require the use of synthetic hair-changing chemicals, etc."

I use the comb for scritching and pulling up the flakiness from my scalp before hopping in the shower. This is 100% NECESSARY if you want a flake-free scalp.

NoPoo,2yn6sm,malatruskawka,5,Wed Mar 11 21:19:15 2015 UTC,Do you use any products outside of shampoo and conditioner for styling or heat protection?   I love straightening my hair (curly girly here too) but it makes the oils so much more noticeable and I feel them way more. My curly hair still sometimes needs some support or frizz protection via hairspray and/or serums (both have silicones so I'm looking for new products).
NoPoo,2yn6sm,NosemaCeranae,2,Wed Mar 11 05:14:46 2015 UTC,"Hi! Definitely kick those silicone products. If you're still using them, and attempting to go no-poo, you wont succeed. I say this because silicone is nearly impossible to wash out without heavy sulfates; even if you covered your head in baking soda and scrubbed for an hour, I doubt you'd be left with nice hair.   How long have you been attempting no-poo?   If you're just starting out (say, about 7 months in), you may not be experiencing the ""full potential"" of unwashed, naturally oiled hair. What I noticed before going no-poo is the frizzy, unkept flyaways and untamed hair. During my first few months of trying shampoo-free, my hair was oily, greasy, and just downright gross feeling. To be honest, it was pretty disgusting. I wore my hair in a bun and used a scarf or large headband during the first three months. But somewhere between then and about 8-9 months I had this amazing realization that my hair looked great! It didn't feel the best, but that soon worked itself out too.   Now I have no need for products. Sometimes I'll add a SUPER TINY amount of coconut oil to the ends and infuse some sweet orange or lemon oil into it for smell. There is also natural ""hair lotion"" you can buy, make sure it is silicone -free, that you apply to damp hair and let air dry. I only add anything to the ends of my hair, never to the scalp.  I guess what I'm saying is to 1) kick the products 2) let your natural scalp oils do their thing and 3) have patience. It can work out! Does this answer your question?"
NoPoo,2yn6sm,NosemaCeranae,3,Wed Mar 11 15:27:32 2015 UTC,"I've been nopoo for 3 months, WO once a week. I find that my scalp is dry, roots are greasy and dull, and BB brushing makes it look super thin, stringy, and greasy. :( I've tried using honey, but I find that my roots still look dull. What should I be doing to keep my hair not looking greasy?"
NoPoo,2yn6sm,cleeder,5,Wed Mar 11 06:27:43 2015 UTC,Sorry to highjack since I'm not OP but: Have you tried a lemon water rinse? I have oily hair as well and I find that helps. I wrote a post about it not too long ago.
NoPoo,2yn6sm,cleeder,3,Wed Mar 11 09:38:41 2015 UTC,"Hello! Oh man, I remember this feeling. It is very difficult to go through, for sure. But I'll tell you, in a few weeks you'll probably start seeing some improvement. Every person is different. For example, I am of Greek heritage and have naturally more oils than many women (on my scalp and skin!), so my ""transition phase"" took about 3-4 months. My greatest recommendation is to kick everything you're putting in your hair. Stick to only water and manual care for the oils.   This is easier said than done, but I promise you it will work. Look into scritching the scalp and preening with your fingers or with a boar bristle brush. Do this before bedtime. Understand that your hair will look flaky, greasy, oily immediately after doing this. The idea is to move the oil from the dull roots to the ends of the hair. Rinse with hot hot hot water for about 30 seconds, then switch to cold for a few seconds, then back to hot. I do this about 4 times. It also helps distribute oils.   I'd get in the habit of doing most of this before falling asleep. You'll notice the oiliness decreases by the time you wake up. Also, remember to wash your pillowcase often! If you have a greasy pillowcase, it will get onto your hair and the cycle continues.   Patience and manual care is the best advice I can offer. It's not the easiest thing to hear, but it has worked for myself and many friends of mine. Ditch the honey, it'll make things greasier. Lemon, as recommended in another comment, may also add the shiny/oily look to the hair. The sebum (natural oils) are acidic already, so adding extra acidity to the greasiness makes it worse. This is why baking soda is used to strip oils-- it is alkaline. If things get really bad, you can use a light amount of corn starch with a make up duster and pat your roots, then brush through thoroughly. This can help soak up some extra oil and look partially presentable. As I responded to someone else on this thread, I wore headbands/scarves/buns until my hair looked better. This took about 3-4 months (putting nothing in my hair) but it sure did pay off. Now I rarely worry about my hair. I love the natural, healthy feeling.    Edit: spelling"

NoPoo,2yn6sm,effy-is-stoned,1 point,Wed Mar 11 20:19:10 2015 UTC,Oh totally. I find just ignoring it and letting it do what it needs to do is the best method.

NoPoo,2yn6sm,effy-is-stoned,2,Wed Mar 11 20:58:09 2015 UTC,"I've been water-rinse only every 2 days all winter and my hair looks better and my dandruff disappeared, so I'm really happy.

NoPoo,2yn6sm,effy-is-stoned,2,Wed Mar 11 15:45:10 2015 UTC,"Hello! I'm very active as well! I do lots of hiking and find that the excess sweat (especially in the hot summer) really builds up on my scalp. My favorite method for care, as I've described to a few others, is the scritching method where you scratch the scalp with your nails/wooden comb to get flakes up, then rinse them away! Sometimes I have to use a blow dryer after my rinses to help remove them. I usually do this while watching a television show at night before a shower. I take about 10-15 minutes to do this, brush through with a hard BBB, then rinse, and it sure pays off. No matter how sweaty and gross I get, this works. And as time goes on, you may be able to go longer than every 2 days. Right now I do the scritch/BBB/rinse process about every 3-9 days, depending on what I'm doing. The average is about 6 days. Does this help? Keep up the good work!"

You could also try using dry mud mask clay powder (kaolin or bentonite clay) for a similar effect, though your hair will change to a texture that makes it easily moldable, but you won't easily get a brush through it - some people love it while others hate it. Alternately you could try a ""mud rinse"" with mud mask.

Trial and error are a must.    Put your shampoo in the cupboard. Don't throw it out; it could be nice to have if you every need to get rid of some silicone build up. If you have conditioner, throw it out because it likely has silicones. Get something silicone free (Tresemme Naturals is inexpensive) or read about BS/ACV rinsing (sidebar). If your hair is very dry you may need to co-wash (conditioner only wash) rather than WO; co-wash is no-poo. Even though you have straight hair, a lot of the /r/curlyhair advice applies to /r/nopoo too. It's the same idea: cut the silicones and sulfates. So I recommend learning about that from their sidebar. Read about S2C (squish-to-condish) too, which can help thirsty hair get hydrated. Try a coconut oil deep condition (4 hours) sometime. You'll end up washing your hair 2-3 times after, but doing this once a month or more can help deal dry hair. Watch YouTubers."

NoPoo,2ycfn7,chinkyypooo,3,Sun Mar 8 16:06:01 2015 UTC,If you have naturally oily hair and you're going straight to WO you're probably gonna wait a while for that oil to go away. Invest in hats or maybe try a different transition method. I use corn starch and a BBB to get oil away from my scalp.

NoPoo,2ycfn7,RatSandwiches,1 point,Mon Mar 9 00:03:57 2015 UTC,"It took me about 3 weeks for things to even out, and honestly about 2 months to get things where I wanted them to be (where my scalp and hair honestly feel good all the time between ""washing""). It was a long, slow process for me!   I also found that WO did not work for me. Probably it was my water itself - it is kinda stinky. But I was too lazy to get a showerhead or anything, so I am just using really dilute baking soda and vinegar 1x/week, and co-washing 1x/week. It has been great for me, and adding the co-wash has really helped keep my hair feeling healthy and moisturized."

NoPoo,2y9jjb,cleeder,2,Sat Mar 7 19:13:47 2015 UTC,"You're less than a month in, so you're still in a transition phase. It took me a good few months to really get used to it (and I'm not even WO like you, so props!). Stick to it, though. Before going nopoo. I noticed split ends a lot, as my hair (oddly very similar looking to yours) was straight and had a range of thickness, from black and thick to blonde and fine (it changes colors depending on the season, interestingly). Anyway, about three months into nopoo, I realized I didn't have a single split end - not one. It really does work wonders. It's all about maintaining the natural PH level.  Have you considered doing a hair mask once every two weeks, or so? Something natural, including some of the following: eggs, yogurt, raw honey, aloe vera gel, apple cider vinegar. Perhaps just giving it a boost with something like that (they also promote shine, strength, volume, and ""tameness"") every now and then might help you out a bit.  Do you use any dry shampoo (aka cornstarch) to help you last a bit longer? I find it's very helpful.  I'm assuming you're using a BBB? Really separating out inch chunks of hair at a time and focusing on brushing the oils from scalp to root really let me go another day or so, especially if combined with a little cornstarch dusting.  Also, in the shower, really try to use your fingers to ""pull"" the oils from root to tip when it's wet."
NoPoo,2y9jjb,occidentalis,1 point,Mon Mar 9 03:30:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback!  I'm definitely still in the transition phase. What sucks is I already went through this once. Last time I went 4 months or more before coming into a second transition phase and giving up. I should have stuck with it.  I notice with my hair that I have a LOT of short hairs that are revealed at my part, and when I try to tie my hair back. Before nopoo, I couldn't even consider tying my hair back on a day that I had washed it, because there were so many short hairs that didn't have any hold and would just stick out. I'm hoping to repair this through nopoo. Obviously everybody has some short, new hair growth, as well as longer old growth, but I think my problem was with breaking these hairs off prematurely.  At this point, I haven't considered doing a hair mask. I really want to go as natural and bare bones as possible. If I do decide to do anything, it would probably be a honey mask/wash (honey is just a great natural substance). What is the primary purpose of doing one of these masks?  No dry shampoo at this point either. Again, I'm trying to go as natural and barebones as possible. Though if it's something that helps me eek out another day, it might be something I should consider. I'm trying to do this without too much notice from my significant other. She's a great girl, but I don't think she's the type that would understand me saying I'm not going to ""wash"" my hair ever again. So this is one of those things I feel like I have to do first to prove that it works, before mentioning that I'm doing it at all.  Anyway, I BBB every day, and probably spend way too long doing it. I make sure that I get every section of my hair, and really try to work the oils down my hair with repeated brushing. I do this mostly at night because I find it actually makes my hair look greasier, rather than better. Sleeping on it after this gives me it more of a disheveled look the next morning, rather than just greasy.  Finally, it took me a while to get my shower routine down. One thing that I find cannot be expressed well enough through text is just how much you really have to work at your hair to get it clean without chemicals.  I've got it down now as to sufficiently clean my hair on wash days, but for a while I just didn't grasp how much work was involved, and would walk out of the shower with almost as greasy hair as when I went in."
NoPoo,2y9jjb,occidentalis,1 point,Mon Mar 9 16:12:56 2015 UTC,"The primary purpose of a hair mask is just to combat the natural change in elements. In winter, our skin (and hair) are still susceptible to the intense dryness of the air. Even just using raw honey or raw aloe vera gel is beneficial.  This blog has a few pages you might be interested in:   https://almostexactlyblog.wordpress.com/2014/04/11/rom-wo_update5/ https://almostexactlyblog.wordpress.com/2013/09/15/tips-for-rom-success/ https://almostexactlyblog.wordpress.com/2013/05/03/no-poo-friendly-deep-conditioners-no-oils/   She went about 4 months to transition into a phase she was content with, and it took her another year to really have it kick-ass. She started out using dry shampoo to help with the oil, but now hardly uses it. You can consider it more of a temporary aid rather than something to adopt permanently.   Something you may notice and might want to consider is getting a shower head filter. It removes the minerals that make it ""hard"" and contribute to hair getting dirtier faster.  You don't do any sort of french braid, do you? I find that those work best when I'm in the ""dirtiest"" part of my schedule, because it just looks like a nicely styled french braid. When my hair is shorter (your length), I have to have bobby pins to help out, or else the smaller strands dangle, looking not so great due to their oil.  Also, I would recommend switching to satin pillow cases. They're ""softer"" on your hair, the full praise of them can be found with a quick google search, and I highly recommend it. They need to be washed more often, but being ""natural"" means taking more time and effort into little things more frequently, like washing pillow cases more or scritching and preening your hair."
NoPoo,2y9jjb,occidentalis,1 point,Mon Mar 9 17:40:45 2015 UTC,"Good to know about the hair mask. I'll do some research.  I've considered a shower filter, and was actually going to make  a post here about what to look for in a a shower filter. I need to find a handheld  showerhead filter like so, but I don't know what qualities to look for in terms of the filter itself.  My hair wouldn't be quite long enough to do a french braid, I don't think. My topmost layer of hair only hangs naturally just below my ear. Pulled straight, it's about chin length. For now, I just put it up in a folded-over bun/tail when I want to get it up and out of my way, and/or combined with a cap.  AS fro the pillowcases, I have a couple of satin-y pillow cases that I change out regularily. I don't know that they're technically satin, as they're polyester, but I am on the hunt for a whole new set of bed sheets, and with the warmer weather, I'm looking for silk/satin.  Going natural is definitely a lot more work, I agree. I remember when I had short hair, I could wake up, shower, and be done with it. Now, with longer hair, it takes a lot more time. Going one step above that and going for natural hair care, I spend more time on my hair these days than my s/o does!  FYI, I was going to wash my hair today, but instead I gave it a good BBB and applied some cornstarch. That stuff really does work wonders. I guess my other concern with it is if it will cause too much oil to be washed out of my hair when it comes time to wash it. When I wash my hair with W.O., there is obviously still a light coating of oil remaining on my hair afterwords. If the oil is being soaked up by a product, will my hair be dry after washing it out?"
NoPoo,2y9jjb,occidentalis,1 point,Mon Mar 9 18:48:00 2015 UTC,"I haven't found that cornstarch soaks up the oil too much. When I was first going nopoo, I was also concerned about the dry shampoo negating the effects of building up oil to reduce oil production, but it's just a small buffer. The oil is still there, just not removed - there aren't any chemicals pulling it from the strands; rather, the cornstarch sticks to the oil. I definitely don't like using it too much, because I want to wean myself off of it eventually, but it's a slow-moving boat. When washing with water, the oil is still what grabs to the hair and water, pulling with it the cornstarch rather than the other way around. At least, that's what I think. It feels like it's that way. Also, I just use cornstarch on my roots, as the length of my hair is usually fine.   I would keep in mind that you should only use cornstarch the day before you want to shower or the day before you're going to put it up, or both. It does add a little more volume to your hair. If our hair is a similar as I think it is, it ""poofs"" out a little at the ends. If I use a BBB to brush it down, it does stay, but then it's just a thin, slick side of hair, so I try to ""fluff"" it with my fingertips.  Also, for satin/silk, there's something about the weave that makes it pull less at the fibers of skin and hair. It also doesn't absorb your oils, so plus side: your pillows ans sheets aren't drying you out; negative side: oil stays on them.  I think the biggest help for me is the support from others, especially in this community.  I don't mind having gross hair, and if my life allowed it (read: if my work allowed it), then I would just let my hair get to be a big ol' greasy mess for as long as possible to expedite the transition... but no. I have to do a careful tightrope balance between progress and acceptability.  Just yesterday, actually, I started a log of what I'm doing, how I feel it's going, and what I'd like to change. I think the constant questioning of whether I'm doing the right combinations, or whatever, is making me doubt it all, so hopefully being able to look back at my motivation a month from now will be helpful and boost my own morale. Maybe if you keep doing a picture a day, it'll be like little milestones for yourself that you can look forward to.  I decided to start doing the OCM at the same time of making my nopoo routine a little more natural, so all of the oily transition is just super for my self-esteem. I'm keeping to it, though! If anything, I'm stubborn, and I don't want to give-in to something just because it's easier."

NoPoo,2y880o,onthebr1nk,3,Mon Mar 9 04:35:12 2015 UTC,"I'll try but I'm not big on measuring.  For the Honey Poo:   2 Tbs. of Organic Honey (I don't use raw honey myself -- I just use pasteurized stuff you find in the grocer -- but some people say raw has added benefits, so your choice) Couple drops Ylang-Ylang Couple drops Tea Tree Oil (use whatever oils you like or omit them entirely if you prefer. I like YY cuz it smells nice and is supposed to help with hair growth. TT oil is an anti-fungal so great for flakes.) 4 Tbs. Warm Water (you can use filtered or spring if you prefer but I just use tap)    Put it all in a cup Swish it around till it's all blended and shit Rub it into your damp scalp, especially where you get flakes. Leave it on for 3-5 mins. Rinse   It's not going to foam, and it's not going to be thick so don't expect those things. Just lather it in and go with it. I have a fine hair in a bob style so I don't need much of it. If you have longer or thicker hair, consider adding more. I go with a 2:1 water/honey ratio, but if you find it leaves a residue or whatever, you might want to try a more diluted 3:1 water/honey ratio. Easy on the oils too if you're hair is oily. IMPORTANT!!: you can only make one batch of this at a time! Honey spoils when you add water to it and don't use it immediately so don't do that.  For the lemon water:  This one is easy. I highly recommend investing in a spray bottle for easy application.   1 pint of warm water (again, bottled or tap, depending on what you prefer) juice of 2 small lemons or one large lemon mix it in a cup, pour it in a spray bottle.    When you're done washing your hair with honey, spray this on your head till it's nice and saturated at the scalp.  Leave it on for 3-5 mins. Rinse with warm water, then cold to seal off your hair. Enjoy not feeling like a greasy bum.   Hope it helps!"

NoPoo,2y1zzp,audreyality,1 point,Fri Mar 6 17:16:04 2015 UTC,"for me, switching to a lower end silicone free conditioner didn't help nearly as much as oils did with my ends. i use the tresemme perfectly undone, and it helps my hair to feel cleaner, lighter, and softer all around, but for my ends i also really rely on oils.  i only use coconut oil before showers .. i usually shower later in the day so i'll smooth some coconut oil on my ends and then wear it up until i shower and rinse it out. for days when i'm not planning on showering or wetting my hair later on, i use a dry styling oil (less greasy/heavy) and smooth that on. note, i don't do these every day, usually more like every other/third."

Also, switching between super hot then cold water about 4 times (30 seconds each time) really helped move oil from the scalp to the ends. Remember, during the transition your hair will be funky.

NoPoo,2xyxu8,stochasticverse,2,Thu Mar 5 03:07:58 2015 UTC,"I have been brushing my hair with a boar bristle brush thoroughly a few times a day (and before showering) and it seems to do next to nothing to spread out the oils/wax buildup.  I have hard water - could this be a factor? If that's the reason, do I need to give up nopoo?"
NoPoo,2xyxu8,Dngrousgrpfruit,1 point,Thu Mar 5 04:09:01 2015 UTC,"how are you brushing with the bbb?  Are you brushing like you would to detangle with a paddle brush? That will only get the top layer.  I have long, really thick hair so I have to section it  kinda like for preening, and brush each section with the bbb 3-4 times before moving on to the next.    I do this a few days a week, while reading or watching tv."
NoPoo,2xyxu8,cleeder,1 point,Thu Mar 5 16:13:08 2015 UTC,"On the note of hard water.  I've been trying to go no-poo lately, and have relatively hard water myself. Not the hardest, but not soft either. One thing I've found to be really helpful is to BBB twice on shower days. I'll BBB before getting in the shower to clean debris and help spread oil down my hair. Then, after my hair dries post-shower, I'll do a thorough BBB again to remove mineral build up from my hair. If I don't do this, my hair is rough and easy to tangle (and thus more prone to breakage).  When doing my post-shower BBB, I am thorough. My BBB fills up with gunk fast, so I have an old rag that I will use to clean the brush as necessary. If I'm on a new section of hair, it'll only take a few strokes to cover the brush in build up, which I'll wipe off immediately.  As for the waxy build up, I've found that this usually means you didn't wash your hair well enough in the shower, or you went too long between washes. I went 4 days over the weekend without washing my hair, and I had to wash it Tuesday and Wednesday to be able to get the excess oil out of my hair. Right now, I'm only realistically able to go 2 or 3 days between washes  and still look half respectable. 3 is pushing it, but if I'm just kicking around home, I'll throw it up in elastic and give my scalp and hair an extra day of nourishment.  When washing your hair in the shower, you really want to make sure to cover every area multiple times and from multiple angles. It's not like washing your hair with shampoo. Washing with WO is a lot more involved. If it wasn't for the hope of one day only having to do this once a week, it wouldn't be worth it as a matter of time.  Disclaimer: I'm relatively new to the WO routine as well, so take what I say with a grain of salt. The information presented here is based on my experience as a WO newbie, as well as research from around the web."

If you've been using your routine faithfully and experience greasy hair, try using less ACV in your rinse, cut out honey if you've been using it, try switching to a citrus rinse, or use a comb instead of a brush to style your hair.  If you have greasy hair and need a quick fix on a day when you're not washing your hair, try applying a tiny bit of cornstarch to your scalp and combing through to the ends. Remember, greasy hair does not mean dirty hair, it probably doesn't need to be washed!  *CORN STARCH is the secret to keeping your hair from looking greasy at the roots. Apply in small amounts to your roots, and rub it in; keep adding the cornstarch in small amounts until your hair looks good. Takes the grease right out!!

NoPoo,2xsn6u,blackbirdsongs,3,Tue Mar 3 15:46:39 2015 UTC,"Honey is pretty decent, but only on the ends because it can become a sticky mess and make the scalp excessively oily. The same for coconut oil.   Coconut oil is a savior and all no poo'ers should have a supply of it at home."

NoPoo,2xsn6u,stochasticverse,6,Tue Mar 3 20:29:24 2015 UTC,"That's the thing about no poo you'll have to get used to... The oils in your hair provide the protection it needs, so the oil isn't meant to be stripped out. When you bleach or color it's really bad on your hair and will strip out all of these protective oils you've built up without washing. So the best is to not color your hair. But if you must, the coconut oil is great for the dry ends. I brush through really well with a BBB.   Source: I've been water only for 5 years. My hair is fabulous."
NoPoo,2xsn6u,stochasticverse,-6,Tue Mar 3 21:24:12 2015 UTC,"K, well I hate my natural color and a one-time event isn't going to ruin everything, so the lecture is kind of uncalled for.

No-poo will definitely preserve your colour! I also try not to use hot water when rinsing my hair to keep the colour from bleeding. Dry shampoo or an alternative is your friend and will keep you from washing your hair too frequently. I use macadamia or argan oil rubbed into the ends of my hair when they are looking dried out."

NoPoo,2xpqg8,MirandaTS,4,Mon Mar 2 21:47:49 2015 UTC,"How often do you wash with BS/ACV? If you are doing it daily, that definitely sounds like too much. I have heard that the ideal amount of BS is 1 tablespoon in a cup of water. Same with ACV. But that you shouldn't be washing with BS/ACV all the time - only when your scalp gets greasy. From what I understand, you are supposed to wash your hair with water as much as you can between BS/ACV washes. As time goes on and your scalp adjusts, you try to lengthen the number of days between BS/ACV washes, until you find that you can go water only.   Some people also condition their hair with coconut oil. People who use shampoo will put coconut oil onto their hair, tie up their hair and stuff it in a shower cap, and let the coconut oil sit for hours and sometimes overnight. HOWEVER, I have heard that this sort of coconut oil conditioning can be difficult to wash out if you are no poo, so if you choose to to this, I would start off with a minimal amount. I use coconut oil to moisturize my lips and hands/dry skin, and if I have extra, I will sometimes rub it into the ends of my hair. I find that I am able to wash it out fine even though I BS/ACV once a week and do WO the other 6 days. Your results may vary.   Some more tips - since the greasiness starts at roots (since the oils come out of your scalp) try to minimize exposing your ends to the BS. The way I pull this off is I actually use a condiment bottle for my BS solution, and I will squirt it (cold) directly onto my scalp while my hair is still dry -that way I can feel whether or not I got it everywhere. When I am ready to rinse the BS off my scalp, I will hold the ends of my hair up, so that when I rinse, water will fall from my scalp, down my neck, then down my body, bypassing my ends. This prevents the BS from drying out my ends.   This may be obvious but I just want to make sure - you don't use a hair dryer or any other form of heat on your hair, do you? Heat like that can definitely damage your ends. Before I went nopoo, I would blow dry nearly daily and it destroyed my ends.   Edit: Crap, I realized that you wrote at the bottom that you already own a BBB, but I will leave that part in my comment in case someone in the future happens upon this thread looking for advice on the same issue.   Have you heard of boar bristle brushes? If not, I would suggest doing a search on this subreddit, and on google, for ""boar bristle brush no poo."" Just a century or two ago, it was uncommon for women to wash their hair more than once a week, so to prevent their roots from getting too greasy, they would use boar bristle brushes to spread their scalp oils throughout their hair strands. This was done by brushing daily, and thoroughly (there's a saying about how women would have to brush their hair 100 times a day.) This would keep their ends moisturized and would also impart an attractive shine to their hair. I bought a boar bristle brush earlier into my no poo attempt, and I found that if I spent 10 minutes brushing, I could sometimes go longer with WO before I had to resort to a BS/ACV wash. If you end up buying a boar bristle brush, I highly recommend doing your research and reading reviews online before choosing to buy one. There are also videos online showing you how to most effectively use a boar bristle brush (how to flip your hair over and brush from your neck upwards to properly distribute oils, how to clean/maintain your brush properly and wash the oils out of it, etc.)"

You'd typically use a carrier oil to dilute essential oils because they're too concentrated to be used on the skin alone.  In this case though, the oil could be just for moisturising or oil cleansing, or to help distribute the baking soda more easily."

A lot of people also consider a boar bristle brush to be a necessity, but I found a lot more success from only finger detangling (no brushes or combs!). Which way is up to you!   Unfortunately, there is a period where your hair will be greasy and smell funny, if you have been using sulfate shampoos, no matter what you do. Give it about a month before changing up your routine so your hair/scalp can adjust.   Depending on your hair type, WO might not be for you. If you have curly or wavy hair, I recommend jumping over to /r/curlyhair, as a lot of us nopoo. Curly peeps generally can't get away with WO, so /r/curlyhair has a list of approved products on the side.  Check out the sidebar for additional info! :)"

I also have some wave in my hair, so I decided to go CG. I co-wash (Vo5 or Sauve) and use no brushes or combs. I wash my hair more often than most people on here (every other day) because when my hair gets a kink (from a quick ponytail or bun), it holds it until I can wash it again.  But the way you treat your hair should be really tailored for you. I recommend either going WO or co-washing (particularly if you have some wave) for a month and then start to change your routine until you find what works for you.  However, my biggest recommendation is not to use BS or ACV more than once a week at most. Dumping acids and bases on your hair every day or every other day will damage your hair. I know it's a popular no poo method, and it can be great as an extremely limited use, but I think it is abused too much as a shampoo substitute instead of using it to start with a clean slate."

Don't be afraid to condition - My hair is naturally dry and the ends got snarly, dry and brittle when I first switched (I blame my addiction to silicone conditioners ;)) I wish I had purchased a quality silicone free conditioner from the start, knowing my hair is predisposed to dryness.    That's everything I can think of- Don't be shy if you have any other questions! :)"

NoPoo,2xl5om,loligogiganticus,3,Sun Mar 1 22:48:33 2015 UTC,Batiste dry shampoo. That stuff is amazing.
NoPoo,2xlrv4,opalesse,3,Sun Mar 1 22:23:44 2015 UTC,"I have 2A hair.  Make sure your conditioner doesn't have any -cone ingredients (silicones), as they will gunk up your hair without shampoo to strip it out. I use Vo5 and love it. It's around 75 cents a bottle.  Any boar bristle brush will work, but I don't use brushes or combs at all. I detangle with my fingers in the shower with conditioner. It's cheaper and shows off my waves.  I use coconut oil once a week or other week. I put it in before my shower, let it sit, and then I wash it out with warm water and conditioner. I rinse my hair in cool/cold water.  I do not use shampoo at all, so I don't have any recommendations for that."
NoPoo,2xlrv4,thatweirdfemale,1 point,Mon Mar 2 16:25:00 2015 UTC,To get rid of the oil do you use the water-only method or is oil not a problem for you anymore?
NoPoo,2xlrv4,thatweirdfemale,2,Mon Mar 2 17:27:52 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about natural scalp oils or coconut oil? I always co-wash, which is washing with conditioner. I use Vo5 conditioner. I wash in warm water and rinse in cool/cold water.   For natural scalp oils, it is more beneficial to wash in cool/cold water the majority of the time and just wash in warm for a deep clean when your hair gets too greasy, but washing my hair in warm water is a guilty pleasure of mine.   For washing out coconut oil, you definitely want to use warm water. It loosens up the oil and lets whatever your hair hasn't absorbed slide off.    Edit: no poo generally has an adjustment period of greasiness; for most people it seems to be about a month. I did WO and boar bristle brushed for about 4 months before I gave up and started co-washing and finger detangling. All my problems cleared up pretty much immediately. I combine the CG method (/r/curlyhair) and NoPoo."
NoPoo,2xlrv4,thatweirdfemale,1 point,Mon Mar 2 18:30:05 2015 UTC,"Do you wash your hair with water every time you shower or only when it's getting greasier? If you don't wash your hair every time, do you still allow it to get wet?"
NoPoo,2xlrv4,blackbirdsongs,2,Tue Mar 3 00:11:37 2015 UTC,"I co-wash my hair every other day. I have a shower cap for when I shower and don't wash it.   I guess I shouldn't wash it that often, but I'm not as hardcore about it as a lot of people are."
NoPoo,2xlrv4,blackbirdsongs,2,Tue Mar 3 01:00:39 2015 UTC,Mine gets dull and uncooperative if I don't wash it twice a week at least as water-only. I usually do 3-4. You're not alone :)!
NoPoo,2xkecs,Vangohhh,5,Sun Mar 1 15:29:42 2015 UTC,I take showers every two or three days and have been using WO for three months now. Very satisfied with the results.
NoPoo,2xkecs,throwaway33434,4,Sun Mar 1 16:57:18 2015 UTC,"I'm probably a couple weeks past where you are in the process and with showering every day with hard water, my hair still feels amazing. I love it!  Question: how often do you clean your BBB? I've been doing it every other day with a conditioner"
NoPoo,2xkecs,Keyyys,2,Sun Mar 1 17:10:52 2015 UTC,"Same here, lovin it lol. It's funny there was this one weekend where I was being way lazy and didn't shower for some time (gross but it led me to nopoo), and realized that my hair looked way better and was easier to style without using gel. Still can't believe how clean it's getting by just using water. I haven't actually gotten around to cleaning my brush but it definitely needs it. Do you soak the whole thing in conditioner?"
NoPoo,2xkecs,SallySubterfuge,2,Sun Mar 1 17:27:50 2015 UTC,"I have oily hair but not alot of it - I use the BBB just about every day and after about a week it gets that ""dusty"" look and needs to be washed. Based on advice I found on the interwebs, first I take a comb and clean out the old greasy hair (ew!) then I soak it face down in hot water mixed with a coulple drops of a mild, sulfate-free shampoo. Swish it around, then soak it for about 10 mins. Be careful not to get the wooden handle wet if you can avoid it. Rinse out the bowl, then swish and soak in a container of cold water for about 5-10 mins. Be careful to keep the brush face down when taking it out of the water. Then I run my fingers over the bristles a couple times to shake out the excess water then just leave it out face down to air dry. It takes a few hours but it works very well."
NoPoo,2xkecs,Keyyys,1 point,Mon Mar 2 06:21:54 2015 UTC,"Seriously. My hair was so flat before nopoo and now it looks/feels amazing.  I put a couple small dollops of conditioner on the bristles and sort of work it through the bristles with my fingers.. It doesn't take much really, just make sure to rinse the brush thoroughly after"
NoPoo,2xkecs,causticwear,3,Sun Mar 1 17:52:56 2015 UTC,"I'm in the exact same place you are. Water only, last shampoo was a month ago. I wash my hair WO every second or third day depending on how it looks/feels. My hair is short so it's been super easy to care for, and I'm really loving how great it is."
NoPoo,2xkecs,ForeverMadrone,2,Mon Mar 2 00:11:00 2015 UTC,I rinse out my hair like once a week and will sometimes do a tea tree co-wash if my hair gets too dry/starts smelling weird.

NoPoo,2xj6cj,Mithmaniac16,4,Sun Mar 1 04:33:27 2015 UTC,"To strip out the grease, you need to be washing in warm water, then rinsing in cool to close the hair follicle back up.   I also ended up co-washing because my hair just didn't like water only (after like 6 months even). You would think co-washing would make my hair more greasy, but it made it less."
NoPoo,2xj6cj,thatweirdfemale,3,Sun Mar 1 14:17:28 2015 UTC,"Give it a few months. A couple weeks isn't long enough to be back to ""normal"" yet."
NoPoo,2xj6cj,dougmpls3,3,Sun Mar 1 14:27:43 2015 UTC,"In addition to those three comments, I want to add/suggest that BEFORE YOU SHOWER you should scritch your scalp with your fingertips, then brush it thoroughly with a Boar Bristle Brush. That has been the biggest change for me.  And like the other person said, it takes a long time. About 6-8 weeks until it will start feeling normal again"
NoPoo,2xj6cj,Keyyys,2,Sun Mar 1 17:16:19 2015 UTC,"Along with what the others are saying, I tried a honey and aloe wash(just mix a little honey with 100%aloe) and it definitely helped with the greasiness(and terrible itching/dandruff)."
NoPoo,2xj6cj,Carnifex94,1 point,Sun Mar 1 19:10:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about others, for me, I went from washing everyday with shampoo to using water only. If I missed a day during the time I was using shampoo it would get really oily. But once I went to water only it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be from the start. The technique I use is just running my hands through my hair and then closing my fingers and pulling my hands out kind of like a squeegee effect. Then just rinse my hands with water and then repeat. It has worked wonders for me. I still rinse it everyday when I shower. I've been no poo for almost 1 year."
NoPoo,2xigvb,wittyrandomusername,6,Sun Mar 1 00:20:01 2015 UTC,"One wash won't really make much a difference. I have terribly hard water (think swimming pool level chlorine) that sits on my hair and I use a clarifying shampoo and conditioner about once a month to strip away all the build up. I wouldn't worry too much about it, repeated use of shampoo is where your hair really starts to suffer."
NoPoo,2xigvb,Tsuedo,3,Sun Mar 1 01:53:49 2015 UTC,"Lol, I'm a co-washer, and I accidentally bought the shampoo instead of conditioner (Suave coconut, the bottles look similar). I got all the way to putting it in my hair before I realized something wasn't right.  It went OK."
NoPoo,2xigvb,physicsphaery,2,Sun Mar 1 06:34:43 2015 UTC,One wash won't matter. I still wash once every 3 month before I get a haircut.

NoPoo,2xi2i5,Moviequestion,5,Sat Feb 28 22:10:27 2015 UTC,I found BS to be too harsh on my scalp and hair so I wouldn't suggest using that alone. You could go water only or use other vinegars (I used white vinegar).

NoPoo,2xi2i5,Greyzer,3,Sun Mar 1 22:12:31 2015 UTC,"You need some sort of acidic rinse after using BS.  If you can't find ACV, diluted lemon juice or even citric acid will do the trick."
NoPoo,2xi2i5,dougmpls3,1 point,Sun Mar 1 11:22:12 2015 UTC,"thanks, lemon juice is a very good idea!"
NoPoo,2xhyqo,emissch,3,Sat Feb 28 21:36:43 2015 UTC,"It has to do with the pH. There really isn't much more of a reason. It's extremely acidic. You could probably get similar results from lemon juice, but ACV is generally much cheaper and is about 1 pH less acidic."
NoPoo,2xhyqo,thatweirdfemale,2,Sun Mar 1 14:27:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah I just find it odd that acid has that de-tangling effect, I don't really understand why an acid would do that to hair which is what I was trying to find out. But thanks for the response :)"

NoPoo,2xfmhv,VenatusTerra,3,Sat Feb 28 04:55:35 2015 UTC,"I personally WO, and sometimes use this shampoo. It is really important, and will become more so as your hair grows, to follow the Scritching/Preening method.   You may not need it now, but you will need a boar bristle brush. Make sure you get one that is %100 natural boar bristles, no nylon.  Substitute a natural sulfate free shampoo of your choice if you notice that you are getting a bit of build up from your hair product. WO is really only designed to work with your natural sebum, nothing more.   Hope that helps you out, good luck!"
NoPoo,2xfmhv,VenatusTerra,1 point,Sat Feb 28 05:00:21 2015 UTC,"WO   How often do you do your scritching/preening method? Just before showers, or whenever you think it's a little too oily?"
NoPoo,2xcn4n,binos_grrrrl,2,Fri Feb 27 13:54:26 2015 UTC,You could look for some sulfate and silicone free shampoo/conditioner. There should be some organic mousse and hairspray too. You could ask your hairdresser maybe for some natural products. Ditching the products is completely up to you.
NoPoo,2xcn4n,a_strange_beard,2,Fri Feb 27 15:01:00 2015 UTC,"This. NoPoo should be for you. Don't feel that you have to do it one exact way. If you use a mix of methods, and use a good product, then that is your NoPoo method."
NoPoo,2xcn4n,VenatusTerra,2,Fri Feb 27 21:54:51 2015 UTC,"It depends on your no-poo method.  Water-only will struggle to wash-out most hair products, especially those with oil, wax, or silicone.  Methods that use pantry ingredients (rye flour, honey, baking soda, vinegar) may be able to remove some more mild products, but will be unable to remove silicone or heavier oils and waxes.  Methods that use soap (castile soap, shampoo bars) can remove some lighter oils, though they're still going to struggle with anything too heavy.  I know there are some silicone and wax-free products that claim to wash-out with only water.  You can do a little research and see if anything sounds right for you.  I know there are also recipes online for DIY hair gel.  One thing about no-poo is that it often makes hair more manageable.  I never really used product in my hair, but since going no-poo I've found that my hair is a lot easier to style."
NoPoo,2xcn4n,ammolite,1 point,Fri Feb 27 18:53:35 2015 UTC,"/r/curlyhair has a list of good sulfate/silicone free shampoos, conditioners, and products!"
NoPoo,2xcn4n,thatweirdfemale,1 point,Fri Feb 27 20:54:38 2015 UTC,"Depends on the product. I had some stuff I believe was called ""It's a 10"" or something like that, it rinsed out super easy with just water, and didn't seem to change the texture of my hair once I used it and removed it."
NoPoo,2xcn4n,downhillcarver,1 point,Fri Feb 27 22:19:43 2015 UTC,"Instead of no poo I went with silicone free conditioner and sulfate free shampoo. I heavily researched silicones and found which of my styling products contained only water soluble silicones. You might try that before going completely no poo.   I have fine, drier hair and I like to curl it sometimes, so I need to be able to use some form of product for heat protection. I've had no issues with this regimen, in fact my hair holds curls better if I wait about 3-4 days after washing to curl it. It can take up to a week for my hair to look greasy at all, a BBB has been instrumental for this ""low poo"" thing to work. So going low poo can work, it might be a good inbetween step too if you think you'll eventually want to go water only."
NoPoo,2xdnx0,syyyyrup,1 point,Fri Feb 27 18:46:29 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this is good for my BBB, but lately I've been putting a couple tiny drops of olive oil in the length of my hair before using it. Almost zero static. The brush seems to distribute that oil the same as my scalp oil, and since I use so little the excess still comes out of my scalp.   I do that before I shower, because supposedly olive oil protects the hair from swelling in the water. It's been working really well to keep it moisturized and relatively frizz-free.   Edit: I also have type 2c hair."
NoPoo,2xdnx0,lannawho,1 point,Fri Feb 27 19:01:52 2015 UTC,"Olive oil is like God's gift to man, I swear! It's great for everything.   Do you think coconut oil or vitamin E oil would also work?   As BBBs have natural bristles, I can't imagine it'd be bad for it. Maybe if too much got into the roots of the brush and grew moldy, but I think it'd be like that with anything.   I seriously love my 2c hair. My sisters and mom have 3a and 3b - I think I definitely got lucky there, as far as maintenance requirements go."
NoPoo,2xdnx0,lannawho,1 point,Fri Feb 27 19:21:49 2015 UTC,"I have no idea about vitamin e oil. Coconut oil seems too much for my hair, which is weird, because I have low porosity hair and every website is telling me coconut oil will be great for me. Haven't used it for a while though, and I've learned a lot since then, so maybe I was doing it wrong. Have you had good luck with it?"
NoPoo,2xdnx0,RatherNotRegister,1 point,Fri Feb 27 19:28:23 2015 UTC,"I put coconut oil in my hair about once every two weeks and let it sit in a warm towel for hours - kind of like a deep conditioning. I know that vit E oil is good for skin and for ears when piercings dry out, and since hair is basically skin...   Everyone's hair is different, and everyone has different things that work for them! Maybe olive oil is better for you than coconut oil.   OH! I just remembered - when I first moved into my apartment and we were so broke we couldn't buy conditioner, I used olive oil because my SO's shampoo and conditioner had olive oil in it (he has a mix between 3c and 4a hair). I only used a few drops and it made my hair super gross."

I have bangs and wavy hair (2A most of the time). Throughout the week the waves straighten out some, which is fine for me. I use baby powder most days to perk up the roots and my bangs. If my bangs are out of whack I'll wet just them with my finger tips and the sink faucet, and blow dry them.

NoPoo,2xa1vz,Sycaid,1 point,Thu Feb 26 21:40:39 2015 UTC,"From what I understand you should be good to use just water to rinse out the dye. Most dye's come with a conditioner to use after, your choice whether you want to use or toss. Just make sure you follow proper scritching and preening before the dye job or wash with your shampoo, and then rinse very well and make sure you are rubbing your scalp thoroughly through out. The condition with your conditioner of choice!"

Do you get that dry, prickly feeling on your scalp after a shower? Like your skin is shrinking/shriveling a little because it's missing so much moisture? In my head, I equate that feeling with losing hair. Try shampooing every other or every third day."
NoPoo,2x9csw,BariSaxGuy,1 point,Fri Feb 27 01:57:59 2015 UTC,I guess I don't know. I don't feel my scalp all that often. I'll stop shampooing so often
NoPoo,2x6v2a,Mithmaniac16,3,Thu Feb 26 02:57:04 2015 UTC,"I'm going to level with you here. The best amount of BS/ACV to use is none. Using it every once in a while as a clarifying wash is ok, but this mixture is far to harsh, at any concentration. The huge changes in PH that you are putting your hair and scalp through are going to cause damage. I know, I started out with BS/AVC and it ruined my hair.  You are far better off using a mix of WO and an all natural sulfate free shampoo. Check out this shampoo and this tutorial on how to get the most out of WO washing.  As for the cornstarch, it can stay white in your hair, or make it look powdery. It will depend on your hair color and also how much you use. If you happen to have dark hair, cacao powder may help you.  Regardless of what one you use, here are some tips that I found helped the most. It will take a bit of fine tuning to get it just right for you and your hair.   Make sure not to use to much Gently rub the powder onto your roots and scalp Make sure you are allowing enough time for the powder to sit on your head so it can absorb the oils. You can also do this at night and sleep on it. Although I would recommend doing so with a hair wrap on to save your sheets. To remove the powder, flip your head upside down and rub your scalp to help the lose powder fall out. Another option is to use a hair drying on the cool or warm setting to blow away the powder.   Hope this helps!"
NoPoo,2x6v2a,VenatusTerra,1 point,Thu Feb 26 21:50:20 2015 UTC,"Yup. But that recipe is a little strong, if you ask me.   Instead of baking soda, try corn starch as a dry shampoo. I've been doing no poo for a year and that's the biggest thing I've learned, along with using a boar bristle brush."
NoPoo,2x6v2a,lannawho,1 point,Thu Feb 26 14:33:41 2015 UTC,"I thought it was supposed to last me a while, guess i was doing it all wrong. doesn't corn starch stay white in your hair though ? thank you !"
NoPoo,2x40pj,Kpoppin,5,Wed Feb 25 14:00:09 2015 UTC,"Ok. So I had this exact problem. I tried shampoo bars, I tried WO, I tried baking soda and ACV, I tried tea, salt water, and a million different things. I finally found something that works really well for me. Your technique sounds fine, but it sounds like you just need something to break the sebum free. I've been using a cup of water mixed with a tablespoon of raw honey. I only use a tablespoon of the concoction per shower and just rub it in at the roots and comb it through. Everybody is different, but this has been working well for me. Hopefully it does something for you, too."
NoPoo,2x40pj,HDpants,2,Wed Feb 25 16:54:25 2015 UTC,"Honey was next on my list after the egg wash. Do you thinkuh, un-raw honey vs raw honey makes a difference?"
NoPoo,2x40pj,HDpants,8,Wed Feb 25 17:07:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it really does. I tried washing with the honey that comes in like...the bear bottle and it was crap. So then I tried raw honey from my dad's beehives and it was so different. A lot of people recommend something called manuka honey. I've never used it. Just make sure whatever you use is unprocessed!"
NoPoo,2x40pj,HDpants,2,Wed Feb 25 17:12:59 2015 UTC,Is this honey mix something that you pre-mix and store or does it need to be made before each shower? Hopefully I can stop by the store this evening and pick up some raw honey (the prospect of non-waxy hair is too exciting to put off).
NoPoo,2x40pj,weazley,1 point,Wed Feb 25 17:57:07 2015 UTC,"I only mix a little at a time. Like enough for two weeks. It can start to grow mold if you keep it too long, so I wouldn't make more than that though I haven't had any problems yet! Hope it works out for you! :)"
NoPoo,2x40pj,ramalamamama,1 point,Wed Feb 25 22:55:39 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info!

NoPoo,2x40pj,halfbloodsnape,3,Wed Feb 25 20:30:44 2015 UTC,"I think one of the best tutorials I found for WO was https://justprimalthings.wordpress.com/2014/10/20/the-ultimate-water-only-hair-washing-routine-no-shampoo/. I too had huge amounts of sebum build up.  The scritching helped, but what REALLY helped was the preening/pulling technique.  I think its worth a shot."
NoPoo,2x40pj,halfbloodsnape,2,Wed Feb 25 21:12:52 2015 UTC,"Most of the propaganda for WO that I've read just tells the tale of happy days and how ""their hair has never been better."" Even the sidebar ""ultimate guide for WO"" neglects this icky part.. hah! Epson salt is something I've never actually read into.. I think I'll try either that or vinegar rinse if the honey wash doesn't work out."
NoPoo,2x40pj,Towerz,1 point,Thu Feb 26 02:43:47 2015 UTC,The baking soda method seems like one of the last things I would try. Anything that has a potential side-effect of drying out my hair is just a variable I'm too scared to throw into this already winged experiment.

NoPoo,2x40pj,Towerz,2,Wed Feb 25 21:02:01 2015 UTC,"Do you have a boar bristle brush? I had the same problem, but when you break up your hair into small sections and then brush them, it really helps break up the sebum."
NoPoo,2x40pj,ramalamamama,1 point,Wed Feb 25 21:11:54 2015 UTC,I do have a BBB. It's actually sitting right beside me here at work! I know it does its job because the bristles fill right up with the sebum (from only one use).. but maybe if I had 6 different brushes to rotate through I would notice a difference. A freshly cleaned brush through freshly cleaned hair and it looks like I never cleaned either in the first place. Frustrating!
NoPoo,2x40pj,MalavethMorningrise,2,Wed Feb 25 21:15:17 2015 UTC,"If you brush daily for about two weeks, that amount gets way more manageable! Your hair adapts/smooths out/properly distributes and you stop pushing around old oil clumps so much."
NoPoo,2x4tp5,Mahl3r,5,Wed Feb 25 17:51:34 2015 UTC,"The BS/ACV method has been shown to be very damaging on your hair. The PH swing that it puts your hair and scalp through can cause lots of problems. I will say that BS/ACV can work great as a clarifying wash, which strips everything away so you are working with a blank canvas.  I would recommend stretching out how often you are using them, and start trying WO on days in between, utilizing the ""Scritching/Preening"" method. https://justprimalthings.wordpress.com/2014/10/20/the-ultimate-water-only-hair-washing-routine-no-shampoo/ Having short hair, this should be especially effective. The eventual goal should be to stop using them as your main ""cleaning"" product.   I used the BS/ACV when I first started and It worked, but it eventually turned my hair into straw. Wean yourself off of it, and look into WO.   It can also really help to get an all natural sulfate free shampoo to have on hand to use when you really need a wash but don't want to go so harsh as BS/ACV."
NoPoo,2x6vqv,patient_mule,2,Thu Feb 26 03:02:35 2015 UTC,"Hard water is going to make it a bit harder, there is no arguing that, and unless you can shell out for a water softener, your filter is only going to be able to do so much.  It sounds like you are not getting as much of the sebum off your scalp as you want, and here is all I can offer to help. Obviously I don't know every detail of your routine, so forgive me if you are already trying/know these things.   I am not a fan of BS/ACV, but I feel it has its use as a clarifying wash. I can understand if this isn't an option because of your sensitivity, but if you haven't tried it, its a good place to start so you can start with a clean slate. After that, I would only use it if you really feel that you must, or if you had to use a heavy product because you went to a wedding or something.  Again, I don't know your exact hair type, so this product might not be the perfect one for you, but the brand has other types of shampoo. This is an all natural sulfate free shampoo that I have been using for quite some time along with the conditioner. I only use it maybe once a month or so, and a very small amount when I do. The price with shipping can be high, but the bottle has lasted me over a year.   Obviously using shampoo is not WO washing, but I feel that they compliment nicely, and you are still preventing your scalp for coming into contact with harsh, stripping chemicals.  Now how you treat your hair before you wash it can make a BIG differance too. I used to just get into the shower and stand under the water and rub my scalp a bit. I was basically ready to ditch the WO till I found this helpful guide.   The only other option I can thing of is a dry shampoo. I personally don't like the commercial ones, and tend to stick just using cornstarch. I have blonde hair so it works for me, if your hair is darker, you make want to try cacao powder.   Here are some tips that I gave to another NoPoo'er about the dry shampoo.   Make sure not to use to much Gently rub the powder onto your roots and scalp Make sure you are allowing enough time for the powder to sit on your head so it can absorb the oils. You can also do this at night and sleep on it.

If you have hard water you'll have to use an acidic  rinse after washing and/or need to rinse the soap out with distilled water, but it might help remove the oil.  Even people who have very sensitive skin can use some organic soaps provided they have limited and natural ingredients.  I know a lot of people on this sub swear by Chagrin Valley - Their products are supposed to be truly all-natural.  The samples are reasonably priced, and natural soap does last longer than commercial soap.  You might want to give it a try!

I'm pretty sure it's impossible to go WO with hard water. It makes my life a living hell because I have pretty curly hair. I wash usually 2-3 times a week, and condition 5 times. If I don't my hair becomes a giant frizz fest. It's always very difficult to comb and detangle though, I'm not sure what else to do."

Just bad.  As for WO wash, the experience with depend on how you wash your hair, and also how often.  I say this all the time, you have to do what works for you. There is no one NoPoo that works for everyone. I do WO paired with the occasional use of an all natural shampoo.  Now to get the most out of WO, there is some steps you need to make sure you can get a good clean. Follow this [""Scritching/Preening]() method before you wash your hair.   /u/TheShotgunBetty is right about frequent washing, but there are some steps you can do to help combat it. Hitting the hair with very cold water at the end of the shower will help close the cuticles and prevent damage while increasing shine.   I think you would be best served by using a good sulfate free shampoo so you can start out fresh, and then using the above techniques, switch to WO. If you need to shower daily because you work out or just enjoy it in the morning, simply get yourself a nice shower cap.  Hope that helps!"

Think wedding/office party or whatever. Some of these can be a bit pricey, but I have had a small bottle of this brand for over a year, and i still have a 1/4 bottle left. I don't use it often, and when I do, I use it sparingly.   Big believer in the ""Scritching/Preening"" method. By far the best step by step tutorial for WO.  A Boar Bristle Brush (BBB) is a MUST, especially with long hair. I just got a hair cut yesterday, so I'm down to nipple length, but I was rocking full bellybutton length using this WO method.

Both of the comments above are great suggestion.  I know when I use coconut oil, I find that I have to use it at night, or is weighs me down. I simple rub a dime size amount in my palms to liquify and warm up, then massage into my hair, focusing on the ends(where my problem dryness is) and then put my hair into a high bun and sleep on it.   If your hair is able to absorb it easier/quicker then mine, it might not be necessary to do it at night. The suggestion to do it after the shower can be taken a bit further, and actually do it in the shower, where the heat can help open the hair follicles, helping absorption. Then hit the hair with some really cold water after. This will close the follicles, making them lay flat, thus ""trapping"" in the moisture, reducing frizz, and increasing shine.   It might take a bit of trial and error to find the right oil/amount of oil for your hair. I do like coconut oil, but also will use grapeseed and argon oil. Hope this all helps!"

Sometimes I feel like this subreddit has lost sight of a few things. We could be better appreciating the amount of unnecessary chemicals we're all saving. The stupid amount of plastic bottles. On transportation of said bottles. On the time and money spent on something unneeded, to be scrubbed on your body then rinsed down the drain, to who knows where, to do who knows what. And I don't care if they don't test on animals, there's always something more deserving of r&d time and funding than a hair care product no one really truly needs. I don't care if it's safe, it isn't. Fucking. Needed.  Not using shampoo kinda goes against a lot of norms we have set up for ourselves as humans. It's pretty badass, if you think about it.
