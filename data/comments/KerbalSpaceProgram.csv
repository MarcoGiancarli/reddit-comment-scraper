Then, you can connect your other hard drive as well, jump into bios and select whichever to boot from. You can make the linux drive your default, and run ""sudo update-grub2"" (I think) and have it detect the windows boot, so it's available to choose when you boot your computer.  I like to do it this way so I have a dedicated drive for both OSs, and it's not a pain to reformat one or the other. No chance of losing linux if you reinstall windows and disconnect the nix drive, and no mistakes made if you reinstall linux if the windows one is disconnected.  Of course, both can safely be on the same drive, but I do this for ease of use.

KerbalSpaceProgram,3dysii,Disastermath,8,Mon Jul 20 18:07:24 2015 UTC,"Damn, those graphics are stunning. Is this even KSP?"
KerbalSpaceProgram,3dysii,f4hy,30,Mon Jul 20 18:11:12 2015 UTC,Show this to people who keep repeating that graphics don't matter and that it doesn't matter that Squad is ignoring them...
KerbalSpaceProgram,3dysii,A_Gigantic_Potato,17,Mon Jul 20 19:34:29 2015 UTC,"I kind of agree but at the same time I can't imagine Squad delivering the kind of quality as the modders on this. Don't get me wrong, Squad does a good job with the game but in all the time I have been playing KSP the modding scene always delivered stuff ten times earlier than Squad, ten times more features than Squad and generally ten times better than Squad. This is similar to the Elder Scrolls series and other such games in that the devs create the basic version of those features or even none at all for some features and if you want it better you take it and throw out their version in favour of a modded version. Throw out stock aero and put in FAR. Throw out stock solar system and put in RSS. Throw out stock effects and put in RealPlume and friends. and so on.  So for me, personally, it would be far more valuable if Squad concentrated on the basic issues of the game, like the under the hood engine stuff that often is the root cause of many headaches. Those are things that are far harder or even impossible for modders to fix. Also something which I think does benefit me more is when Squad improves on those things that enable modders to do more with the game, to do away with those things that currently require the modders to work with unstable and hacky workarounds to achieve some functionality. The games moddability is great but every time Squad improves one of theses things modders take it and take their mods to new dimensions.    Of course for the average gamer who prefers vanilla or lightly modded only and for those who are new to the game expanding features of the base game would be very awesome. And Squad implementing even a basic version of such a feature would probably go a long way to impress potential customers."

KerbalSpaceProgram,3dysii,akron712,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:49:48 2015 UTC,"Well let's break this down. I never said there was something wrong with mods - simply that weather effects and atmospheric conditions should be standard in the game. Additionally, lets answer what's wrong with mods with a two part questions: Do you trust random people on the internet to put data on your computer without any fear of malware or other damaging files? Would you prefer the in-game client provide these ""beautifying"" graphics as a native option?  Many developers focus on improving gameplay, graphics, and optimizartion. That's the nature of the business. No one is asking Squad to abandon gameplay to focus on graphics, but it's something that should be addressed at least within in the next 3 to 6 months."
KerbalSpaceProgram,3dysii,Oh_its_that_asshole,5,Tue Jul 21 02:05:10 2015 UTC,"You make some valid points. so i will address them :)  1) In many circumstances with KSP, the same mod authors produce several different mods. Additionally, many of the more popular mods out there have been in circulation, almost certainly, since before you even started playing KSP... All of these mods are open source, so this ""data being put on your computer"" is open for all to see and examine and help the authors make their mods better. Anything malicious would be found very quickly I imagine.   Or maybe I am just naive and blinded by my love for KSP and the good intentions of the authors lol :p. That being said, I dont download tiny sketchy mods. i only use high profile mods that have lots of comments and attention in the forums.  2) ""many developers"" have huge studios and finances behind them. Squad is a relatively small independent studio. they need to focus all their man-hours into fixing basic QoL things like making the fucking game 64 bit.... or like fixing any of the dozen or so bugs that have plagued the game for years, or fleshing out the basic core mechanics that already exist. Just look for any of the threads for ppl complaining about things that weren't ready for the 1.0 release.   Personally i think there are many things are best left to the mod authors to work on for the time being while squad does other things more crucial. For instance: the Procedural Fairings mod has been around for ages....... and other mods have had their own fairings (KW, B9, AEIS, etc.) and i think it (ProcFairings) works really well. Squad set aside countless hours and days into integrating fairings into the game. and they are still hardly as good and look like trash compared to procfairings.   Astronomers Visual pack has also been around for ages. it has gone through numerous iterations and has had tons of outside help from countless other individuals. No telling how long it would take squad to create something HALF as beautiful. not to mention all the other mods that OP used to make these unbelievable screenshots.   KSP is probably one of my favorite games of all time. sorry if i came across as harsh. I like to think about it like LEGO sets. Sure you can play with one box set and it is awesome, but what is even better is putting together all your different sets and making something even more amazing.   Fly safe!   /endwalloftextsry  tldr: Yes, no."

KerbalSpaceProgram,3e2kfe,Captain_Planetesimal,3,Tue Jul 21 18:03:15 2015 UTC,"Ports that close ought to magnetically dock anyway; I suspect that they're currently bugged.  If they aren't, and they look like they're trying to dock, then I'd try locking the suspension of the landing legs on your 8-man outpost: that should raise it up at least a little. Alternately, you could torque the rover down using its RCS.  If they don't look like they're trying to dock, you're going to have to edit your persistent.sfs or quicksave.sfs file. Look for the string ""status = acquire"" and change it to ""status = ready"" in all cases. Obviously, back the file up before you change it."
KerbalSpaceProgram,3e2kfe,jansenart,3,Tue Jul 21 14:24:55 2015 UTC,Either try to find somewhere flatter or try ramming the main station harder when you dock.

Combination of the low escape velocity of Moho and the high speeds you reach closer to the sun makes any capture burn a hefty one.  I did it with an interplanetary stage using four NERV engines and a bunch of liquid fuel, and it took 25 minutes of burning; by the time I jettisoned the spent interplanetary stage, it was on the verge of melting from the heat.

I usually use LV-T30 ""Reliant"" engines for their thrust for larger sstos that have cargo bays or payloads, but the advantage with the nuke engines as of 1.0 is that they only use liquid fuel, which makes it easier on the ground when trying to plan how to balance oxidizer and liquid fuel, you just fill it all up with liquid fuel tanks.  It does make for a pretty weak space plane going into orbit, you're starting your circularisation burn almost immediately on coming out of the atmosphere, but the geek in me loves the efficiency ;-)"

KerbalSpaceProgram,3e03a0,WolfeBane84,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:37:13 2015 UTC,"It would be a fine feat for sure, but so much extra delta v needed to bring an extra craft, I guess you'd need to be sure you really needed two planes (maybe different experiments or something).  I use Kerbal stability enhancement which stops the excessive wobble with connecting parts, I'd wager one docking port placed just back of centre on the plane would probably hold it steady enough to your ship. I'm guessing the size of ship to get to Laythe with some spare fuel for fun when there wouldn't exactly be breaking 1g in acceleration, so as long as stuff was reasonably secure a docking port would be enough.  Then again, maybe you've built a beast with 6 mainsails what do I know :-)  EDIT, just an additional thought. One of these planes without fuel is quite light, you could probably counter balance some batteries or fuel tanks on the opposite side of your tug to balance it out while bringing a more useful resource than an extra plane."

I actually destroyed an expensive station because I ran out of power while heading toward it, and lost another couple crew when one of my station sections didn't have quite enough d-v to make orbit because it flipped on the way up.  I actually screwed up here. I can't transfer fuel across the solid fuel section and I didn't install a fuel line. It has a  survey scanner on it, so I'm going to push the station into polar orbit and use that."

KerbalSpaceProgram,3dy6uu,SolidPurpleZebra,5,Mon Jul 20 15:27:53 2015 UTC,"It isn't people that dislike them, it's reality. They work great on paper, but the stability and control issues inherent in the design make it so they're never quite as efficient as they should be - and the issues when the control issues become apparent are pretty dramatic.  It might be possible for a modern computer-control system to make it work - essentially smoothing out the control issues with active automated guidance - but no one that I know of has tried it."
KerbalSpaceProgram,3dy6uu,iBeReese,5,Mon Jul 20 16:30:59 2015 UTC,"Fly-by-wire systems and active assists pretty much solve this. If they didn't, many flying wings, like the B-2 would not work. And a lifting body like the Venture Star or this would fly MUCH better than the shuttle, to the point of being able to land on an airport."
KerbalSpaceProgram,3dy6uu,SimThePilot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:37:32 2015 UTC,Could you elaborate why it would fly better than the shuttle? I thought the shuttle got bigger and bigger wings to get cross range capability? Or can it just land with slower speed and slow down on shorter runways?
KerbalSpaceProgram,3dy6uu,Senno_Ecto_Gammat,8,Mon Jul 20 17:04:56 2015 UTC,"Cross-range capability is another thing, and was totally unneeded, but the USAF requested it and it had to be improved. I'm talking about glide ratio."
KerbalSpaceProgram,3dy6uu,Azaziel514,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:13:11 2015 UTC,So cross-range capability is about lift at hypersonic speed?
KerbalSpaceProgram,3dy6uu,featherwinglove,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:14:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, why?"
KerbalSpaceProgram,3dy6uu,Norose,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:24:19 2015 UTC,"They pretty much solve it - except they haven't yet.   They should solve it. Absolutely. They're critical not only for the B-2 but also the F-16 (and any other dynamically unstable aircraft). And yet, they haven't proven cost-effective. Every aircraft that depends on them (that I'm aware of) is one where efficiency doesn't matter. No one cares if a penetration bomber is inefficient. Even less for a fighter plane. A transport? Now we need to make it haul the freight for minimum cost.  Also, landing at an airport isn't a problem. The Shuttle couldn't do it, with its high landing speed, but it's not hard to imagine a spacecraft that could do it, lifting body or no. From a technology perspective, it's just energy management - get the airspeed down, give it the ability to hold in a pattern if necessary, and you're in. Neither of those are inherently better in a lifting body. Getting the political approval to do it would be an issue... no, the problem isn't landing at an airport.   The problem is taking off again."
KerbalSpaceProgram,3dy6uu,speed7,3,Mon Jul 20 17:14:22 2015 UTC,"Well, it's not exactly a capability of lifting bodies, but like the Venture Star, this is big and light (due to the use of hydrolox), and has got ample lift ratio, so it gives the possibility of that. Even without that, why would you need crossrange capability if you can land without the need for a special runway?  Also, the lifting body design is probably the only one that allows enough space for fuel storage while being able to land horizontally. You can't compare the shuttle to this, they might be space pickups, but their designs are completely different."
KerbalSpaceProgram,3dy6uu,SkyHookofKsp,2,Mon Jul 20 17:19:54 2015 UTC,"Every aircraft that depends on them (that I'm aware of) is one where efficiency doesn't matter   Airbus has been flying fly-by-wire in all its aircraft since the A320 back in the 80s, precisely because it could fly more efficiently on the long haul than any human pilot could. I assume Boeing adopted that too not long after."
KerbalSpaceProgram,3dy6uu,PickledTripod,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:14:50 2015 UTC,"That's actually a different thing. Fly-by-wire as used in modern airliners is about precision control and power - it's the exact same thing as a mechanical control system but includes adjustments to make the system more controllable and efficient. What's needed for efficient lifting body flight is the ability to continuously modify the characteristics of the aircraft (through manipulation of control surfaces, mainly) to maintain efficient, stable flight."

Getting to the Mun and landing was tough but doable.... doing it with enough fuel to get back was a different story! I could probably make a whole post on my first sojurn to the Mun. I ended up rescuing my scientist with 900sci of data on him by landing a big rover that achieved orbit by driving off a steep hill and boosting :P got into Kerbin orbit with ~300d/v left!

KerbalSpaceProgram,3e1vzu,rowanwilder,5,Tue Jul 21 09:06:07 2015 UTC,"I do recommend starting in career mode due to the contracts. Many of them will hone important skills (such as positioning in precise orbits, how to figure out retrograde orbits, etc.). There is a very important technique involving EVAs. When you exit on an EVA, you can store science in the capsule by right clicking on it (as well as taking information from the capsule and storing it again--useful for multiple crew reports). If you have a scientist on board, they can get data from experiments, store them in the capsule, and reset them. This leads to massive science if you are willing to do some quick hops with a lander (such as on Minmus) and then fly home. Two flights to Minmus and you could easily have 4-5K science fairly early in the game. Another option in the very early stages is to build a rover with aircraft parts and check out the biomes near the space center. There isn't much science there, but it is a quick bump for very early games. Also note that doing EVAs in space near a body give you science based on biomes. So make sure you do a polar flight (remember the store in the capsule requirement (or use a radio)), and get lots of observations. The Mun has tons and tons of biomes, so it is a good selection. Never tried. Whatever you want. Focus on aircraft, probes, or manned rocketry as you want. Perhaps the most important items are solar panels early on (you won't get far without them). Store everything in the capsule like I recommended and just reenter with the capsule, heat shield, and parachutes. If you are re-entering with a probe it is more complex, but remember that landing struts absorb shock (you can action-item them in the VAB to the gear command to make them easy to raise and lower).   Edit: Oh, and I would also strongly suggest checking out the Scott Manley videos. You can enter feeling like somewhat of an expert (I studied astronomy, including orbital dynamics, in college), but he will get you to the next level, especially on how to use to program effectively. Most of what I described I learned first from his videos. And pretty soon this will also happen:  http://i.ytimg.com/vi/shgX1YqtjTY/hqdefault.jpg"

KerbalSpaceProgram,3e1vzu,spacebicycle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:15:27 2015 UTC,"Your course is exactly the one I prescribe for newbies: Science > Sandbox > Career.   There are serious diminishing returns with experiments: you can transmit data from a sample, and then come back later to collect the same sample and return it to Kerbin for approximately the same value of the initial transmission. If you do two surface sample collections sequentially (or put, say, a surface sample into two different pods), you'll get a maximum of around 130%. You no longer directly gain science after the 3rd sample, however, processing a 0.00 sample in the Mobile Processing Lab will provide the same amount of data for processing as it would if it was a new sample. Yes. Bring an experienced scientist on a voyage and bring only one of each experiment. The scientist will be able to clean out and reset the Goo and Materials experiments, and otherwise collect the data from everything else, providing you with potentially hundreds of experiments for return to Kerbin. I refer you now to my BestRover. The science you earn at KSC can be extremely valuable in the early R&D tiers, but if you're getting science via probes voyaging to other planets, you're well beyond the need to explore all the KSC locations. Addressing your question: making a small hopper pod isn't the tough part; the tough part is piloting it to the various locations in KSC without destroying it or the buildings. And, if you're trying to fill-out the tech tree with KSC science, you may as well move on to Sandbox mode and explore all the parts in preparation for Career. The bottom half of the R&D tree has the science experiments, you'll know them when you see them, but you're better off researching technologies that will allow you to build ships to better suit the needs of your contracts (when you play career mode). Absolutely: while an experienced scientist can remove data and reset the Goo and Materials  experiments, you can also just design a craft with multiple Goos and Materials Bays, and only one pod seat, man it with a pilot, and have him remove the data from the experiments before ditching them and returning alone in his pod. This is a good way to earn significant science from a single early/mid game Munar/Minmal expedition.   Don't aim for the Mun: by the time you get there, it will have moved. Instead, learn to make a good, circular orbit of between 71 and 100km around Kerbin. MechJeb is not cheating: think of it as a robotic mission control, doing the maths for you.  Learn to use the maneuver node system to plan your burns. You need the L2 Tracking Station for patched conic orbits, but don't bother with the L3, as it will just clutter your map with asteroids that you'll never want to deal with again after the first time."

KerbalSpaceProgram,3e1vzu,PhildeCube,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:45:43 2015 UTC,"For those that don't deliver 100% on recovery you won't ever reach true 100% but 5 observations are enough to reach 0.0 remaining (0.032). Few people bother getting more than 2 observations from a biome, though. Take whole set of science instruments, a scientist, and as many command pod as many observations you want to make. Make a set of observations, collect them, store them in command pod, repeat with the second command pod, etc. Scientist can reset goo and materials bay. You don't need to land on buildings, all you need is to visit every building's area. Simple ""rover"" with four plane wheels, basic jet engine, a pod (or two) and set of science instruments is all you need. The low tech plane wheels are steerable using rover controls. You can click on nodes in tech tree to find out what's in them. Since you need your R&D building on level 3 to unlock last of them, you probably need to run the space agency normally and only give these branches some priority over going straight for science nodes. Any EVA Kerbal (astronaut complex level 2 to get EVA in space) can collect science measurements from instruments, keep it on him, or store them to a command pod. Kerbal scientists can reset Goo and Materials for another use. A kerbal can hold any number of science measurements, even from the same conditions. A pod can only store one copy from given conditions. Command pods are relatively safe to land and you can get rid of most other parts including science instruments before landing."
KerbalSpaceProgram,3e1vzu,Kasuha,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:46:30 2015 UTC,"It takes a while to get it to display 0.0, but it's usually not worth going past two or so trips. Bring a scientist so you can reset one-off experiments (e.g. the goo). Every time you take a measurement, EVA the scientist to collect all the data from all your instruments and reset those that need to be reset. Take all the data from the capsule, then put it in again (this way you will be able to store more than one crew report as well). This way you can get at least a set of data high in space, close to the body you're landing on, and on the surface. Ideally, your lander is capable of taking off again and landing in a different spot so you can get measurements from different biomes. Each time, activate your experiments before landing, and then clean them up with the scientist once you're on the ground and do them again. Note that for EVA reports you don't actually need to do one in flight, since you can get a ""flying"" EVA report from a kerbal that's not standing on solid ground, including once that's just jumping on the moon or something. I would just recommend not landing on the buildings, since you don't need to do that for science. But it's not very hard to build a lander with parachutes and a TWR high enough for Kerbin that can get itself over a building and then parachute down. It'll be cheap enough to run this multiple times since you'll be recovering from the KSC. Honestly though, I'd just delay rooftop trips until you want to build VTOL planes or something :) There isn't really a clear path. You can see in the R&D screen what unlock provides what parts. But if you prioritise science parts over everything else you'll just be doing the same mission over and over again, while unlocking other parts might actually enable you to go to a new place (where you can do less experiments, but they might be worth more). Some of the later parts also only work on the ground and/or in an atmosphere, so those are not too useful until you start doing missions to other planets. Just put them in the capsule with a kerbal on EVA. You can't store the same report twice in the same capsule but other than that, you can have as many reports in your basic capsule with a parachute as you want. So if you can get a kerbal back to Kerbin, you can get the data back to Kerbin, and you don't even need to worry about bringing the science modules back.   Btw. aiming for other bodies will be easier once you upgrade your buildings enough to get the full orbit display as well as patched conics. Then you can just get into orbit, and play around with maneuver nodes until you get an intercept.   For the Mun eyeballing is reasonably easy though; once you're in orbit around Kerbin you just wait until the Mun appears on the horizon, then burn prograde until you get an intercept. (Assuming you're in the kind of orbit you get if you point your rocket at the 90 degree mark during ascent.)"

I used to build a ""rover"" with a wheesley engine, some fuel, the first wheels you get and a capsule and attach every science equipment available to it.   Oh and a little known thing, the KSC flag, the one in front of the astronaut complex, it's a different biome, not easy to get to it with a rover since it's pretty small, but if you can you can get some extra science from there."

Be warned though - one of the docked ports will be ""main"" and that one is real structural connection between the two ships. The main port also provides fuel crossfeed between the station and docked ship. The rest of ports are just ""struts"" and they don't provide fuel crossfeed. Their undocking does not disconnect the two ships, just removes the ""strut"". You, however, want to undock these first, so the two ships don't immediately reconnect once you undock the main connection."

I didnt use the airbrakes in the end but made it to the surface safely.  After taking the screenshots I flew the jet back into orbit, where it still is now, EVA'd my Kerbal over to the carrier (the jet just had around 30m/s of delta-v left) and flew off to kerbin.

If you're placing multiple sets, make sure they're equidistant from the CoM. Lots of parts have lines on them that are a helpful guide. It doesn't have to be perfect.

KerbalSpaceProgram,3dzlao,the_Demongod,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:20:52 2015 UTC,"It's one thing to say that and another thing to do it. I was never able to dock correctly until I started using RCS Build Aid. I always ended up having to ""cheat"" it with MechJeb and it was a profound source of frustration. I couldn't figure out why my rockets would never stay stable, or wouldn't turn properly to dock, even using Docking Port Alignment Indicator.  Fast forward to using RCS Build Aid, and manual docking is easy for me now just with the navball. It never even occurred to me that in ""just make sure they're equidistant from the CoM"" you also have to account for how the Centre of Mass has moved because the tank is no longer full.  This is huge. Indirectly the mod also taught me better ways to design my rocket to minimize the amount that the CoM changes as fuel burns off, which makes docking easier but has also made my rockets even more stable.  It should definitely be a stock tool."

I understand why the sky is ""red"" due to Rayleigh Scattering, but it seems far too red to me.

KerbalSpaceProgram,3duo02,razzzey,8,Sun Jul 19 19:50:18 2015 UTC,"In my experience, the rate limiting factor is usually single threaded cpu physics modeling, not gpu"
KerbalSpaceProgram,3duo02,MadduckUK,4,Sun Jul 19 21:26:22 2015 UTC,There's rumors that we might see multithreaded physics and a working win64 build once Squad gets the game updated to Unity 5. Hopefully that means a better-running game.
KerbalSpaceProgram,3duo02,WoollyMittens,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:41:07 2015 UTC,When it comes to multithreading we may see the physics being pushed to another thread. However you can't break it down anymore than that. So you could have the 'game' on one thread and the 'physics' on another but you can't spread the physics over 2 or more threads. Meaning fps might improve but no guarantees because you can get quite a bit of overhead. I'm still predicting an improvement though. Just don't expect double the fps. (This is a PSA. If you already knew this then carry on.)
KerbalSpaceProgram,3duo02,Unknow0059,4,Sun Jul 19 22:17:29 2015 UTC,"As I said: rumors. Unity already had the ability to spin up threads for your own functions before 5; the problem with KSP is that the game is heavily dependent on that physics thread, which quickly gets overloaded when you try to build big without using larger/procedural parts because you have to use a lot more of them.  From what I've read, though, it looks like U5 uses a version of PhysX that does support multithreading, although I'm not certain if that's what Squad were using for their calculations."
KerbalSpaceProgram,3duo02,VanillaTortilla,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:56:53 2015 UTC,Fair enough. I have never looked into unity or physX before so I'm going to take your word for it. My statement was from my experience from our in-house physics engine.
