Only 2 grades are actually due in person and this is 2 test you have to take at a pellissippi testing center. They are easier than the ones you do at home and 2 nights of studying will easily get you a passing grade.

If you're into history or museums, go to the National Civil Rights museum (http://civilrightsmuseum.org/).  If you're into hunting/fishing or want to check out a massive pyramid with a big bass on the side, go to the new Bass Pro Shop (www.basspro.com/pyramid)  If you're into drinking beer, you can go to the various breweries/taprooms around Memphis like Ghost River, Wiseacre, High Cotton, Memphis Made, etc.  If you're into drinking and going out, you can check out downtown (Beale Street, Main Street, South Main) or midtown (Overton Square or Cooper Young).  If you're really into dancing ridiculously and regretting last night's decisions, go to Paula Raiford's Disco (""Raifords"") on 2nd street after midnight -- but don't come sober.  If you're into Elvis, go to Graceland (http://www.graceland.com/).  If you have time and are downtown, check out the Peabody and the ducks (preferably their ""March"" every morning and evening as they go from the elevator to the main lobby's fountain).  Go to the roof and check out their mansion.  If you're into food, there are dozens of BBQ places around Memphis and I wouldn't dare recommend a single place since that will spark its own debate.

Tennessee,3cy7wc,chocotaco1981,-1,Sun Jul 12 13:47:45 2015 UTC,"Leading Confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest was chosen as the first leader, or “grand wizard,” of the Klan; he presided over a hierarchy of grand dragons, grand titans and grand cyclopses."
Tennessee,3cy7wc,sirdarksoul,6,Sun Jul 12 16:30:07 2015 UTC,"That's different than ""creating"" them, for one. But historians don't really know what his intentions were for the Klan. We do know that the Klan was originally founded to protest what they felt were unfair practices levied against the South as part of Reconstruction -- it was a few years later that certain members and branches started doing the shitty things the KKK is known for today. Forrest's role in this is not clear, but we do know that he left the Klan, dissolved his branch in 1869 and denounced the organization in front of Congress in 1871.   Also, his last public appearance in 1875 was when he was invited to give a speech on racial reconciliation to the Independent Order of Pole-Bearers Association. He gave a friendly speech in which he said "" I came to meet you as friends, and welcome you to the white people. I want you to come nearer to us. When I can serve you I will do so. We have but one flag, one country; let us stand together. We may differ in color, but not in sentiment. Use your best judgement in selecting men for office and vote as you think right.""  I don't really have a dog in the grave fight so I don't particularly care either way. I just think it's important to note that he was a much, much more interesting and nuanced man than just ""KKK=he's evil."""
Tennessee,3cy7wc,NOODL3,-1,Sun Jul 12 17:48:05 2015 UTC,Oh downvoted for truth I suppose
Tennessee,3cy7wc,sirdarksoul,4,Sun Jul 12 16:34:25 2015 UTC,"More likely for being wrong. He was definitely a KKK member and most likely a leader but he was not the creator. He was also definitely a racist but so were the vast majority of people at the time (North and South).  People in the South enslaved the innocent and Forrest was a part of that so he likely did awful things to other human beings. I'm not defending him but while he's not truly a hero to anyone today he was in his time.  You might want to spend a little time reading what the experts say about him. I'm talking about the people who have researched him and read what he actually said. Some of it fits what you'd expect but some of it would surprise you. Running around here waiving your hands in the air and saying ""he created the klan"" isn't anything that people haven't heard before and it's also not even really accurate.  Edit: Now that I think about it, maybe there are some racists around today that idolize Forrest? Possibly we'll be rid of that sort of nonsense in a generation or so. Then people could really discuss Forrest and his ilk without all the drama."

They may even had to approve a marriage between someone who was once biologically male to another man and didn't know it.  Now that they don't want to marry the gays they suddenly find a religious reason.

On the other hand, you can say that they are supposed to marry them regardless of the deeply held convictions because it's their job.

Sounds like hypocrisy to me.    Let me clarify. I don't care that the lady resigned. She did the right thing if it was against her beliefs. I don't think, nor do I think anyone else does, that she should be forced to marry people against her beliefs. In fact, I would take her side if someone forced her to do that without giving her an option to avoid it. She had just a few options, she could have told her boss, I don't want to do this, can I do work elsewhere in this office? Or she could resign. Therefore she had a choice, and she did what was right for her.    I'm talking about the other part, ""to attack them for seeing things differently than you?"" I wouldn't call it an attack, because that implies violence, to which I am opposed. I would call it ""calling them"" on their hypocrisy. I'm a logical thinker, and I simply CAN'T make the right's arguments about gay marriage jive. On no level do they make sense. Which is why I asked you about the marriage of a black and white, to simulate a similar scenario and see how you reacted. You didn't feel it was fair, and perhaps it wasn't. But I'm still left without an understanding of your side.  Edit: I'm a white guy whose ancestors were probably pretty horrible to your ancestors. However, I was born here, just as you were. Sure, the Native Americans were the first to people this land, but they came from somewhere else too. We're really all Africans.

Tennessee,3by44f,chucksutherland,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:30:26 2015 UTC,"Marriage licenses are a government document. The highest law in our government is the U.S. Constitution. Since the Supreme Court ruled that freedom of religion includes freedom from religion, clerks, who are government employees beholden to the law, are required to administer marriage certificates to homosexual couples. Their beliefs rendered them incapable of doing their job, so they stepped down. Here's some food for thought: if a Muslim or Jew chooses not to eat pork because of their religious beliefs, does that mean that a Christian, Hindu, atheist, agnostic, Buddhist, etc. cannot eat pork as well? Since marriage and the legal privileges that come with it are not solely a Christian things, why should non-Christians have to subscribe to Christian ideals? The religious beliefs of these clerks prevented them from giving marriage certificates to homosexual couples. This ran in direct opposition to the requirements of the job they held. They exercised their right to freedom of religion by stepping down.   TL;DR: A county clerk is a government position. The government ruled that gays can get married. The clerks could not do the job they they were required to do, so they exercised their right to freedom of religion by stepping down. Marriage is not a solely Christian institution."
Tennessee,3by44f,R403Q,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:26:41 2015 UTC,"Marriage licenses are state documents. Prove otherwise please. Mine was issued by the State of Tennessee, not the fed gov. 10th amendment. If the power wasn't given to the fed directly then it resides with the state and the people."
Tennessee,3by44f,tatermonkey,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:09:27 2015 UTC,"You are correct that marriage certificates are a state document. However, the prevention of discrimination against gay couples has legal precedent based on the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Ammendment. Since ""no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of the law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction equal protection of the laws"", states cannot deny gay couples the right to enjoy the legal benefits and protections provided by a legally recognized marriage. This is why a state cannot deny an interracial couple a marriage certificate. As such, the federal government HAS set aside the authority to prevent states from discriminating against people. The language may not specifically address marriage, but it addresses legal proceedings as a whole, of which the giving of marriage certificates is a part of.

Tennessee,3by44f,R403Q,2,Fri Jul 3 21:24:09 2015 UTC,Yes it is fascinating indeed. I've always considered gay marriage a state issue. I expected a ruling saying all states must honor gay marriages and such. But this was unexpected.

Tennessee,3bxwd4,chucksutherland,5,Tue Jul 14 18:31:19 2015 UTC,"Start like this, put medium sized things in boxes. Fill in the remaining spaces left over with smaller things. Books and other square shapes go together. Big stuff doesn't need a box, but may need blankets to protect it, so keep sheets out. Pack everything into one or more vehicles to prepare for transport. Use trash bags to pick up all the odds and ends that didn't get boxed and use those bags to fill in the empty spaces in your moving vehicle(s). Drive vehicles to Nashville. Unpack.
