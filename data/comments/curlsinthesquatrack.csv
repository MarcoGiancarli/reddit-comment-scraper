curlsinthesquatrack,37edhs,Bam121,10,Wed May 27 03:37:58 2015 UTC,Maybe he can't dead lift that much. ;)
curlsinthesquatrack,37edhs,roninmodern,3,Wed May 27 10:15:09 2015 UTC,"I've been weightlifting seriously for ~15 years. Before I had kids and a career (meaning I had more free time) I subscribed to Muscle & Fitness. There was once a series that they did on busting through plateaus (mainly on bench press and bicep curls) by starting with a very narrow range of motion (just the top part), and then expanding it every week.   What this required (or what they recommended) was a squat cage with adjustable bars on both sides, so that you could specifically control your range from week to week. So, yeah, they recommended that you do bench presses and curls in the squat cage. I tried this a few times and it actually did help me bust through plateaus.   I'm sure that the jackass that OP confronted was not doing this particular lifting regime, so I'm not saying his actions are justified, but there can be legitimate uses for a squat cage with adjustable side bars outside of just squats...though I fear that this is not the right subreddit for such discussions ;)"
curlsinthesquatrack,37edhs,ewilliam,6,Wed May 27 15:38:26 2015 UTC,but the real question is how much was he curling?
curlsinthesquatrack,37edhs,CaptEFalken,6,Wed May 27 01:35:37 2015 UTC,Ha. Not much. I think he had 10's on the bar.

As in, he loaded up the Olympic bar with 2.5 lbs on each side, stood in the spotters area, and did honestly somewhere around 20 sets. I feel that this was as bad curling in the squat rack."
curlsinthesquatrack,37edhs,Die-In-A-Fire,2,Wed May 27 03:49:46 2015 UTC,"Normally the guys I see doing this have at least 45s, sometimes more.  That said, if a place has 2-4 racks, but 10 benches...go for it, just stay over there with that mess though."
curlsinthesquatrack,37edhs,bon3rface87,1 point,Wed May 27 15:38:47 2015 UTC,I agree with that. But the small gym I go to has 2 benches and 1 squat rack. So when someone uses up either of those for curls. It's really fucking frustrating.

That's very rude to do - and in most cases, different weights shouldn't even be on the same peg.
