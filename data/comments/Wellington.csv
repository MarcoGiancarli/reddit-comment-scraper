Their meat is all stringy and far too lean for even roasting. It's dog tucker. Either go to New World or see if Moore Wilson's have something in your price range. A 2.5kg shoulder should do 4-6 people, depending on what else you serve with it (remember you're cooking all the juice and fat out of the meat so it'll shrink heaps). If you do pulled pork burgers with a bit of coleslaw and lime juice, it'll feed 6 easy. I usually buy pork when it's  on special for $8 or $9 a kilo from New World, so that's only $20 or so.

We've no affiliation to Vicdeals, but Carl has contacted me a couple of times to place a link up to Vicdeals on here. I don't particularly have a problem with the link existing. The agreement was if we link to them, they link to us... fairly simple. I actually took the link down about two months ago and Carl messaged to ask me to put it back.  Vicdeals is not Trademe, it's not ebay, and I assume they have no responsibility of what is bought or sold, nor any recourse for the aggrieved party. My point is that (I guess) it's not a business that has legal requirements and fallback for the buyer/seller.   I obviously don't have to explain this but if you buy from a physical store or via an online retailer, you have not only the sellers word but also the weight of the law, fair trade act, and so on. Trademe has persistent account, tracable and verifiable, user feedback and so on.  Two phrases that come to mind when using Vicbooks are caveat emptor and to look out for a pig in a poke. Does it seem to good to be true? It very likely is.  If we can help at all, please do let me know. It'd be good to get this sorted for you"

I didn't think there was any rule against it, sounds like there's something dodgy going on. If you spent a lot of money on it you could go to the police because that's obtaining funds through fraudulent means."
Wellington,3dslbq,Lethologica_,5,Sun Jul 19 04:25:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks, yeah it wasn't a massive amount of money, I'm really more concerned about how that page might be being run in favour of scammers if it shuts down discussion about it. Very weird. Hope I'll hear back from the admin but feel that it's unlikely!"
Wellington,3dslbq,devil_machine,3,Sun Jul 19 05:01:16 2015 UTC,"I know Carl, and I'd be surprised if he removed it. He's not the only one with removal powers.  Having said that, Vicdeals really isn't a forum for trading things that can bite you in the behind. I would have checked the computer specs myself before taking it home, as they can be misrepresented or outright wrong and opening her up isn't a difficult task.  It was designed for smaller trades between students but there's plenty of dodgy shit on there too, and the community does its best to enforce its removal."
Wellington,3dslbq,sacredsnowhawk,3,Sun Jul 19 06:26:48 2015 UTC,"You're definitely right re I should have checked the computer - it's my bad for sure. My issue is that now I can't even let others know about the seller or get other members with similar experiences to let me know about their situations. Just feel that it was really uncool to have the post deleted with no explanation or recourse, when they don't seem to do that with bad sellers posts, for example!"
Wellington,3dslbq,chimpwithalimp,2,Sun Jul 19 06:33:38 2015 UTC,"They do. Obviously dodgy shit gets removed fairly quickly, and when not removed gets mocked until it does. I've been using it for years and seen only a few stories such as yours (although admittedly having been removed from the group means maybe I'm missing some). With any luck he will see this post (I don't know if he uses reddit much) and respond but if not I'm not sure what options you have if the monetary value isn't enough for the police to take it seriously."
Wellington,3dslbq,DontBeMoronic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:41:27 2015 UTC,"For sure - just wanted to warn others about this seller and see if anyone knew him/could help contact him etc, not a big enough deal to involve police but did feel that not being able to even tell my side seemed like a really dodgy policy. Cheers though!"
Wellington,3dslbq,ElectronicFlesh,7,Sun Jul 19 06:46:09 2015 UTC,Not surprised to be honest. Ostensibly a student deals page but my impression has been it's as much a place for non-students to sell stolen shit to students or to try to scam students
Wellington,3dslbq,thezapzupnz,6,Sun Jul 19 04:50:16 2015 UTC,Exactly this. My friend had his house broken into and a lot of things stolen. Amongst them was an iPhone which was track-able through find my iPhone. They traced it to a known gang affiliated address in Wainui and the police wouldn't do anything.   His laptop turned up on vic deals along with some other things that were stolen that were easy to identify.   I would avoid it tbh. You're much safer buying things off trade me etc where there is some recourse if you buy something dodgy.
Wellington,3dslbq,Avjunza,2,Sun Jul 19 06:52:35 2015 UTC,"I guess it'll teach me to trust internet people! Just a weird thing to be banned for asking about a trade gone badly, seems a really dodgy way to run the site."

Wellington,3dsws8,DontBeMoronic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:25:28 2015 UTC,"Don't forget there are residents in the area who need the car parks.  May seem empty when you go and park but doesn't mean they aren't used by locals.  Saying that, it is an obvious area where people drive in and park and then walk to their work.  edit:  On your point on  it being left empty.  It can work the opposite way.  If it is perceived to be abandoned it could get vandalised."

Yes, even in Karori.  A few years back I went on a beer run and while walking back a good 5m tree was laying on the sidewalk I had walked down to get to the supermarket.

At the end of the day your parents had you out of selfish reasons like all parents do, they wanted a child and they put you into this world.. to not support you properly until you are at the very least a legal adult is a pretty scumbag move.

Just to clarify, I wasn't saying parents are scumbags if they don't support a child to the extent I was supported, however if they are asking the child to pay them back when they aren't even 16 for bare necessities in the modern world then yes, in my eyes they are scumbags and not the type of people who should be parents.

Unfortunately they hire children that can't read, or don't give a fuck and just want to deliver all their shitty papers/circulars and get paid their tuppence.   No point in complaining, no one ever cares. I just never do business with them again"
Wellington,3dh7mi,threalseymourskinner,6,Thu Jul 16 08:46:05 2015 UTC,"First off, newspapers are excluded from ""No circulars""/""No Junk Mail"" because reasons.  But if you complain to the head office of advertisers whose material you receive (Countdown, New World, Warehouse, Mitre10 etc...) and provide your address, they will pass it back to the distribution company, who will then let the supervisor know, who will then let the kids know.    If it isn't sorted within 2-3 occurrences, let them know again, and it will rack them up.  There are actually rules and braking them can mean a distributor/supervisor can be penalised/lose contracts."

It's certainly not some big city wide festival with folks cheering from windows.   Finally, not sure if you're coming from afar, but worth noting that it'll be the peak of  summer so festiveness = 0.

Wellington,3d7ya4,chimpwithalimp,2,Tue Jul 14 21:47:06 2015 UTC,Suggestion at work: Indonesian volcanoes.  Too far away? Anyone here work at NIWA?
Wellington,3d7ya4,first_hermonic,2,Wed Jul 15 00:37:13 2015 UTC,"Indonesia is simply too far away by a factor of about 10,000-100,000 times. It would be very unlikely to smell sulphur in Wellington or Auckland even from an eruption at Mt. Ruapehu unless the wind was in just the right direction and the eruption was massive.   Gas disperses and becomes sparser the further it is from the source, it has to be over a certain threshold concentration to be  able to smell it. If it was possible to smell it in Wellington, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Eastern Australia would have 0 population as they would all have died of asphyxiation from the concentration it would have to have there.  Also, it's not as simple as that as Indonesia straddles the equator, where as NZ is in the belts of southern trade winds. Emissions from Indonesia would likely circle the world several times before reaching NZ.  It's more likely that if a volcano influenced NZ from overseas it would be one in South America in the Andes as that is in the same band of trade winds that circle the globe. Though that doesn't change it being basically impossible to smell sulphur for the other reasons above. However, it would probably be possible to see a fall of fine ash from a large erupton in South America with the right conditions."

Also to keep in mind is that much of Northland, and neighboring city suburbs, are steep windy roads, and what little parking there is, are residential parking on street.  AFAIK, Kelburn, Aro Valley, Brooklyn, Mt Victoria, all have 2hr max and residents parking on their streets.  Karori has unlimited on-street parking, so if you can't find anything, you might want to try out there, even just the parks on the other side of the tunnel.

You are really going to have to think outside the box on this one and talk with the most unlikely people. If you could talk to a well connected real estate agent they could probably give you many ideas of who to start asking. Another thought is you will have to create a sort of sales pitch to help explain exactly what type of dwelling you are talking about. If people think its a permanent thing or even sounds like a permanent thing then they may be put off.

Wellington,3d6yb6,scooter_nz,2,Tue Jul 14 00:25:17 2015 UTC,"Most gyms will probably give you a free personal trainer consultation when you first sign up, or as part of a package offer to get you in the door. They'll teach you what to do, how to do it etc. Optionally you can pay more for longer term personal trainer sessions, I guess, but I don't know how worth it that is. Like everything at the gym, you probably get results out of it based on how much effort you put in...  Les Mills is quite pricey according to rumours I've heard, but you're probably better off listening to someone who knows what they're talking about, which on this topic, is not me."
Wellington,3d6yb6,cman_yall,2,Tue Jul 14 02:06:32 2015 UTC,"If les mills is convenient so are a lot of other gyms, so shop around. Exodus has July free and no joining fee at the moment for their birthday, they have trainers and I've heard good things (I'm actually checking them out tomorrow after a bodybuilder friend recommended them to me). Theres also others including one that just does PT sessions that you book in (but I forget their name... google them).   Les Mill is good, but its over priced for the average gym user IMO, they do do sessions you can book to sort out a program but they are so large you get lost in the system. But then it depends on you, I've been there, people are friendly, the staff are nice, equipment is good, but did I use my membership worth?? Doubt it.   As with any gym if in doubt about a machine, just ask someone while you are there, I would happily spot someone or show them how to use a machine if asked. Also the internet has lots of information, like the SL 5x5 program is a good start for someone looking to start lifting, you'll get some fast noob gainz. Then you will know a few other lifters who will be happy to work in and show you some other lifts.    Also gymeez the supplement store is awesome, they will give you advice on bulking up. Plus their protein icecream is to die for."
Wellington,3d6yb6,Miss_Meltymel,2,Tue Jul 14 05:44:26 2015 UTC,"I tried out Les Mills. My own personal opinion is that it's very expensive for what it is, packed with show ponies, overly full and generally annoying to get a good workout at. I'm currently with CityFitness and use the Thorndon location. Their Willeston St venue is conveniently located, but very small. It's started getting rather full during evenings, but is quite nice otherwise. I've been mulling over Jetts, which have reasonable plans.  Both CityFitness and Jetts have no commitment options, and take a sign up fee(s) instead. Their prices are very reasonable IMHO.  Any gym will let you have a free workout. In fact, Jetts have a five day trial thing according to their site. Turn up at the gym, ask for a guest pass to check them out. Walk in and have a workout.  Random thoughts:   In your gym bag, take gym clothes (top, shorts/trackpants, gym shoes) and a hand towel. Hand towel is taken in with you for when you start sweating (don't drip over the machines please). Bring normal towel and possibly your own body wash if you want a shower afterwards. Bloody good feeling after a decent workout :) Machines have pictures on the side of them which show how to use them. Easy. Don't overdo the amount of weight you put on. You want to be able to do a few sets, and what begins as easy ends up becoming difficult. In addition to above, I thought I was able to do more than I actually could. Poor technique and use of muscles lends to ""cheating"" a particular workout. Focus on fluid, rather than sudden, movements with a hold at the end. You'll get the hang of it. Figure out where the position where the weights hit in the machine and avoid hitting it until the end of the set. In your motion, try and avoid the weights making contact. Somewhat forces a better style and certainly stops very annoying sounds being made. Sets and reps are heavily debated. Commonly, 5 sets of 5 repetitions (5x5) is favoured. I find it too damn annoying with frequent breaks. I do 2 sets of 10, short 15 secondish break in between. I then try and do a third set of 10 to the best of my ability. Free weights are generally favoured instead of machines. I personally wouldn't worry too much, because initially the main goal is to get a decent routine of going to the damn gym in the first place and doing anything. Keep that up for a while, then start worrying about things like that. At that point, you might want to consider using a personal trainer. Take cellphone / mp3 player with headphones for good tunes and focusing on yourself. Don't dick around with your cellphone in changing rooms - it has a camera and that makes people uncomfortable as fuck. Bulking up requires protein and a lot of it. 1.5 - 2 grams of protein per lean kilogram per day. For me, that's about 100 - 120 grams. It's a lot. Protein (whey) powder helps with this requirement a lot. Buy the cheap generic stuff from a health food store. It's still expensive at $50-$60 a kilo, but cheaper than supermarket and supplement stores. Add cold water and shake/blend it. Optionally buy creatine, and throw 5g of that in there once a day.   I've only been doing this for 3 months, so start reading /r/fitness and you'll probably see stuff that contradicts what I wrote. Just some observations:   It doesn't take long for your muscles to become dense. And that's awesome. Not bigger, but it really helps create some definition early on which is very motivating. I try and go 4/5 times a week. I spend 20-30 mins actually working out, but I hop from thing to thing by hitting different muscle groups. I get a decent workout with minimal time. Not practical with the generally loved 5x5 approach. I'm happy with my progress, particularly after looking at getting enough protein. Start lifting stuff for a week, then start worrying about your diet. Your metabolism will likely change."
Wellington,3d6yb6,sitonmyfacebook,2,Thu Jul 16 00:40:00 2015 UTC,"Firstly, awesome answer thanks.  I have some questions though.   I tried out Les Mills. My own personal opinion is that it's very expensive for what it is, packed with show ponies, overly full and generally annoying to get a good workout at.   This gym is 1 minute walk from work, what do you mean buy show pony and why would that affect me?  I'd probably take a 2pm lunch hour to avoid the crowds so if crowdedness is the only thing preventing a good workout I might trial it for a few weeks.   Both CityFitness and Jetts have no commitment options, and take a sign up fee(s) instead. Their prices are very reasonable IMHO.   Thanks I'll check it out   Machines have pictures on the side of them which show how to use them. Easy.   Is it really? I went to elite fitness and some of the work outs required you to twist your arms so your wrists were facing each other when fully extended. The sales person had to show me how to use it.  Is this because it was a home gym with several different workouts or what?  Are individual machines designed for a specific muscle group easier to use (if that's a thing)?   Figure out where the position where the weights hit in the machine and avoid hitting it until the end of the set. In your motion, try and avoid the weights making contact. Somewhat forces a better style and certainly stops very annoying sounds being made.   Cheers, I probably would have pissed heaps of people off.   At that point, you might want to consider using a personal trainer.   I was thinking I'd probably need a trainer from the go so they could put together a plan and show me what to do for the first few weeks.  Might cost a few hundred and I think that might be worth it to get something tailored.   Bulking up requires protein and a lot of it. 1.5 - 2 grams of protein per lean kilogram per day. For me, that's about 100 - 120 grams. It's a lot.   How do you know how many kg's of you is made up of lean kg? I don't have a lot of body fat; if I poke my stomach with my abs flexed my finger probably goes in about 1cm and elsewhere there's enough so you can't see the shape of my skeleton but there isn't much in it.  Is there a formula to work it out? This is another reason I want to know what I need to eat so I don't waste away lol"

I'd probably take a 2pm lunch hour to avoid the crowds so if crowdedness is the only thing preventing a good workout I might trial it for a few weeks.   I like going into the gym with music already blaring and just start jumping from machine to machine. Having to work around too many people socialising and lingering gets me annoyed pretty quickly. The more social atmosphere may be desired by others :) Just giving my own opinion. I go to the pub to socialise.   Is it really?

Is this because it was a home gym with several different workouts or what? Are individual machines designed for a specific muscle group easier to use (if that's a thing)?   Yeah. Most machines are very rudimentary and for very good reason. Add increased resistance to unnatural movements and you're lining yourself up for injuries. If it doesn't feel natural, you're either doing it wrong or its a dangerous machine. You'll hear about some of them on /r/fitness.   I was thinking I'd probably need a trainer from the go so they could put together a plan and show me what to do for the first few weeks. Might cost a few hundred and I think that might be worth it to get something tailored.   Sure, if you want everything all lined up and are looking at optimal gains. I'd strongly recommend emphasis on going to the gym and enjoying yourself so it doesn't feel like a chore, causing you to drop out. Lift shit, do it regularly and eat protein. You'll get results regardless. You can always tune an existing pattern, and I still do.   How do you know how many kg's of you is made up of lean kg? I don't have a lot of body fat; if I poke my stomach with my abs flexed my finger probably goes in about 1cm and elsewhere there's enough so you can't see the shape of my skeleton but there isn't much in it. Is there a formula to work it out? This is another reason I want to know what I need to eat so I don't waste away lol   I just guessed it. I guess alternatively, you could take the lower end of the BMI scale for your height as an indication. Doing the caliper thing to measure body fat would be more accurate. If you start getting gas (""protein farts""), you're consuming too much protein due to it not being digested.  Further thoughts:   You'll read about rest days and the like. More crucial for those who are lifting really heavy shit. I started out doing short bursts 5 to 6 days a week with good results. If you're going to spend much longer at the gym, you may well consider rest days. you will be fucking sore the day after your very first workout (doms). This is a one time thing. Take the next day off. Go to gym the day after regardless. Day after that you'll be pretty good. Should be fine after then. I found when I started out that some of my muscles were simply underdeveloped compared to the rest of mine. Specifically my triceps which were near non-existent. Pay attention to this, are your initial gains will be mostly going there - don't get discouraged. After that, you'll likely find you have a quick jumps up the overall weights. From there is the slow slog of overall progress :)"

Wellington,3d3vtq,daffyflyer,7,Tue Jul 14 06:37:26 2015 UTC,He needs to be bold.   Meeting adult human beings of the opposite sex outside of websites or sleazy bars these days is a rare thing. A large part of that is that people are afraid to approach someone. The art of dating and manners is dead.   Approaching a woman doesn't have to be about a cheesy highly sexual pick up line. All he needs to do is smile and say hello. Ask how their day is going. Or compliment them (don't confuse this with the highly sexual pick up line) 'You look really great today' 'you have an amazing smile' something simple like that. If the woman is attracted to him she will talk back. Watch for the laugh and if she touches her hair its a go. This can happen anywhere. He needs to be out there though. Go to events. Go to places where people are (obviously).  People are too scared these days of rejection. But we are all wanting to make that connection with someone. It's about finding that person who is willing to return the feeling. It's hard. And he will struggle. But he has to be bold.  He also has the advantage as there are more single women in Wellington than men.

Wellington,3d3vtq,FurryMcPurry,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:56:16 2015 UTC,A few of my friends have been successful with tinder and finding a serious relationship - it all depends on who you find.

Wellington,3d3vtq,daffyflyer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:17:29 2015 UTC,"It's a weird paradox that it always seems that finding someone is easiest when you've given up hope of ever begin in a relationship again. I'm pretty sure its because you learn to be happy with your own company and you're more confident and settled, and not looking for a relationship to fix your problems -  which are very attractive qualities. Being desperate when trying to find 'the one' is such a major turn off. Anyway, it's just society that tells us we should be together with someone forever - and TBH though it's nice, it's also a lot of hard work and compromise too. In summary tell your mate to give up and just enjoy life to the full, if someone comes along to share it with him then bonus, if not at least he is having a rocking fun life instead."

Neither really have the format to open a dialog, they are both either 'love it' or 'move on without comment' type sites.  Do you not also have a 'handle' on those sites? Like people follow you, and therefore are more likely to align with your interests and 'like' your posts regardless?  Lastly what do you take from that data? Why do you think the majority of reddit users feel negatively about what you are doing?"
Wellington,3cvpj0,lance99,11,Sat Jul 11 04:14:55 2015 UTC,"I've worked in IT in the US and in NZ (and Ireland) so I can hopefully help!    How is life in the tech consulting sector? What type of hours do you folks see? 35-40 hours a week is pretty common. Tech consultancy, I'm not sure.    What kind of salary should I be looking at? It absolutely depends on public/private sector, size of company etc, but I think as a ballpark you could probably guess at earning ~60% to 70% of your US wage in NZ. Obviously, that is not an absolute rule, but there are factors unique to NZ that limit salary (global location, competitiveness, not really a tech hub). There's plenty of benefits to working in NZ over salary though! Read on.    What is your quality of life and work life balance like? I worked in what was pretty much a government job in NZ and it was very relaxed and easy. No corporate rat race, red tape or bottom lines to chase. Not many ladder climbers that step on everyone. Yes, I did odd hours rarely and yes there were all the same niggling crap you get everywhere in the world, but in general it was a very relaxed environment with ample time off. If you're looking for time with your family, you got it, with the benefit that there's loads to do in and around Wellington, all well within 30 minutes drive.     What do you guys like in a colleague? Don't be a prick. Be humble, friendly, and on your birthday, YOU buy cakes or snacks for everyone in work.     What do you hate in a person coming from abroad? My personal pet hates are loud, brash boastfulness, or one-uppers that have to outdo every story, but obviously these traits are not necessarily restricted to immigrants. Every place has those. Don't be one! NZ is a massive cultural melting pot. My last job there had people from Vietnam, America, The Phillipines, Wales, England, Ireland, South Africa, Russia, etc and that was in a team of 20 people. The joke was that we only had two kiwis or something. Be aware and respectful of cultural differences.     Anything else? Kiwis can be brash, and maybe even appear rude or mean at first, but they are mean to everyone, especially if they like you. I can honestly say after being all over the world that kiwis are one of my favourite people. A common thing I heard from immigrants is that it can take time, sometimes a lot of time, to get to know kiwis beyond just acquaintances. By that I mean it's hard to take that big step from regularly talking to them in work (for example) to actually hanging out at their house, moaning about your day. Kiwi blokes can be very blokish (at least in their minds) and they have their mates from school that they still hang out with and don't necessarily need new friends.  Kiwis don't much celebrate festival days, not like Americans do anyway. Christmas day, Halloween, Guy Fawkes, they're kind of non events. They make up for it by celebrating every single sporting achievement ten times more than anyone else though. Sports are their festival days.  Everything is shockingly expensive. Food, utilities, Internet, travel (petrol!), clothes, restaurants, alcohol, you name it. Often times, it's better to use Amazon in the US for goods and pay shipping because you'll get better quality and more choice.   I've no doubt you'll be fine, and you and your family will love it. Watch out for spending more time with them next Christmas, it'll be summer in New Zealand. It's honestly nothing like Christmas in the US."

Wellington,3cvpj0,atomictaniwha,4,Sat Jul 11 21:43:18 2015 UTC,"The sector is pretty good here, I've worked in Wellington for over twenty years. Some tips:  Salary information can be found here, http://www.absoluteit.co.nz/tech-news-insights/industry-reports/, though in my experience these tend to be on the low side. The more experience you have the more money you can expect, same as anywhere I guess.   Work life balance depends on WHO you work for. MOST places are pretty good and you can expect work from home days and flexible hours. It's ok to ask that in the interview. I always do.   Generally, kiwis are hopelessly non-confrontational. It really isn't in our blood at all. Things are usually sorted out over a coffee or a beer. Wellington is a coffee shop town and more than half the business gets done over a cup.   Wellington IT can be a little bit clicky. This is a very small town and everyone knows everyone else's business. We think we are a big capital city but we are a small town underneath it, and, that's one of the things that I love. You can walk across the city in fifteen minutes, which makes it easy to get to those coffee shops...   Kiwis hate the following phrases:   ""When I worked for company xyz, we did it this way and that way blah blah blah"" Constantly referring to past exploits is painful, you got the job, we don't need you to quote your CV every ten minutes. ""You are wrong"" Confrontation. Try ""Why did you come up with that? Can you show me your thinking?"" Loudness. We don't really do loud...  ""Look at this new idea I have had! Look at it! Marvel in it's awesomeness!"" We don't blow our own trumpet, we think it's a wee bit weird. Selling an idea over coffee to the entire group one on one works way better. Some companies are a little different.  ""But the contract says"" Anytime we drag the contract out on anything we're are in trouble. Confrontation again.    Another very kiwi thing we do is reinvent the wheel. We love to do that. We are still only really getting to grips with things like standards and how they can help. In the meantime, we just love to start from scratch and build a thing completely from the ground up."

Wellington,3cvpj0,sitharus,3,Sun Jul 12 18:00:35 2015 UTC,"New Zealand is quite immature when it comes to applying standards to IT. In my opinion, I haven't worked everywhere, but I have worked a lot of places because I contract. So that means rather utilising a book of standards or processes to make life a bit easier, we try and build stuff from scratch. ITIL is a good example. The rest of the world uses it, we are only just getting started with it. One of the problems here, and it may be the same there, is that we do requirements really badly a lot of the time. We don't quite get the value of a really good Business Analyst."
Wellington,3cvpj0,ycnz,3,Sun Jul 12 21:38:13 2015 UTC,"Cool, I work in a large Wellington-based IT company, so here's some tips :)  For working hours 40 hours is the norm, though unpaid overtime does happen from time to time. The general expectation is you won't work overtime unless you absolutely have to - renegotiate deadlines rather than work overtime. You won't make many friends by working 80 hour weeks when they aren't!  Salary-wise, as a software architect 90k-140k depending on the position and your experience. Degrees are a checkbox item but don't really factor in to much. Senior software dev range is 70k-120k depending on the language, your experience and company. Senior here is mostly a salary band rather than a position of authority.  Work-life balance is better than the US from what I hear from my ex-US colleagues! Most people work their 8 hours a day starting somewhere between 8 and 10 (my company is pretty flexible). On Fridays most companies tend to start drinks around 4:30, and the company will provide some cheap beer/wine/juice. Government won't supply alcohol.  After hours you're pretty much free to do whatever, checking emails outside work is uncommon.  Working with Kiwis is interesting - I'm an British ex-pat, though I've been here since high school I still notice some thing.   In general they're quite reserved and avoid confrontation and can be pretty shocked when someone calls out a problem directly. As a new guy you'll make more friends by politely questioning why something is a certain way. Related to this you'll often find things done in strange ways because nobody has thought to challenge it - if enough people agree that it should be changed you can make some friends by actually changing thing. Be careful though!  Also remember that our employment laws are quite different from most of the US - outside of the 90 day 'trial' that is optionally placed in contracts there's a very strict procedure to fire people. A lot of employers seem to be under the (mistaken) assumption that you can't fire someone for poor performance, so you'll have to deal with the occasional person clearly out of their depth. This also comes back to the conflict avoidance.  In general you'll find people pretty chill here, it's definitely slower paced than a lot of other countries. There are some bad managers around but they're not that common. Often you can use employment law to get back at them."
Wellington,3cvpj0,ycnz,3,Sat Jul 11 21:02:08 2015 UTC,"1) 40 hour work weeks are standard. Being a hero is donating time to your company's owner. There are better charities out there. :)  2) NZ's not really big enough for the high-end architecture jobs, for the most part. There are some. You won't be paid nearly as well as in the US - maybe $120k? Intergen in Wellington do a lot of sharepoint, I don't think they're an amazing payer though.  3) See 1). I would note that my commute to town is about 10 minutes at 7:30, 20 minutes at 8:30, which is probably a fair bit better than you're used to. :)  4) Competence, hatred of sharepoint.

Legally we are entitled to 4 weeks of leave every year with some companies opting for more for their emoloyees. There are also a few public holidays as well. You get 5 days of sick leave annually as well that are paid.   Colleague wise probably just people that work hard, get the job done in a timely manner and don't whinge.

Otherwise I think they have a lot in common, and that's why I like them both.  I found that Melbourne had great public transport, lots of culture/arts/events, good wages and a good restaurant and bar scene.   Wellington on the other hand, I find has much more natural beauty, and so many great places to do outdoor stuff nearby. Is very easy to travel around by car and very compact in general. Has comparatively affordable housing, and also has a very good food/bar/arts and culture scene (for it's small size). The people also seem noticeably more friendly and relaxed here too.  I'm also a big fan of the fact that it doesn't get to 45C in summer!  Edit: Wellington also makes far better use of it's waterfront areas IMO. Melbourne seems to forget it has the sea.. although the river is nice.  Short of a massive change in Wellington's population and economic strength I don't think it'll ever have the bustling big city feel of Melbourne, but I'm okay with that.   If that's your scene, and you're willing to take it's disadvantages, maybe Melbourne is the place for you."

That would require extensive rail and roading work, as well as dredging and construction, but it'd open up a huge expanse of waterfront.  Expand the strip of land along SH2.  Semi-cut and cover Jervois Quay. Seriously, roads like that have no business running through a city. It cuts the city off from the waterfront. If you could semi-trench it and then build over the top in a manner similar to the bridge from civic square, you'd revitalize the Queens Wharf Area.

Narrowing the Quay's should make it much better.  However, in saying that, there WILL be a very loud bunch of numpties who will oppose ANYTHING that will improve traffic. Therefore, it is unlikely anything meaningful will get built for the next half century.  Regarding your first point, this will be a controversial opinion. I believe there is quite a lot of waterfront already. I think that we should build a friggen massive parking building opposite Westpac stadium and make parking there really cheap so drivers decide to park there and walk to the CBD, rather than driving into the heart of the CBD.  The strip along SH2 should be widened so the trains don't have to slow down on the corners. Maybe an extra lane both ways as there are three lanes of solid traffic merging into two.

Wellington,3cmoen,daffyflyer,3,Mon Jul 13 07:50:50 2015 UTC,Wellington should look at what Melbourne does and try and do the opposite.  Although having a grand prix would be nice :)
Wellington,3cmoen,disordinary,5,Thu Jul 9 05:49:04 2015 UTC,"Actually, I disagree. There have been mistakes that Melbourne have made. The important thing is that we learn from them, and do it a bit better than them.  1) In Melbourne CBD, there are a few apartment buildings which have essentially blocked out all the sunlight of other apartments. In order to stop that from happening in Wellington, if you build an ""high"" rise apartment for example, you have to buy out the air rights for the buildings next to it, so any further developments won't block out all the sunlight that the apartments have.  2) Wellington is unable to have too much more sprawl due to the geography of the area, so that's not too much of an issue.  3) As for parking in town, Wellington parking operators should (ideally), move to a daily rate rather than having earlybird pricing. Also, starting evening pricing at 4pm would be nice as the demand for parking spaces at 4-5pm is quite low.  4) We need a grand prix, although I don't know where we would host it. A nice racing track that's open to hooners would be nice as they would (hopefully) be off the road.  5) Streetscape ""upgrades"" generally do nothing to help the community IMO. It is people, not streetscapes that make a place feel alive. Victoria St in Welly feels so dead after the 'revitalisation' . Same goes for High St in Lower Hutt"
Wellington,3cmoen,daffyflyer,6,Thu Jul 9 06:02:32 2015 UTC,A nice racing track that's open to hooners would be nice as they would (hopefully) be off the road.

Wellington,3cmoen,disordinary,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:18:57 2015 UTC,Please inform me about the motorsport here. It seems non existent in Melbourne - minus the grand prix.  edit - Is there a proper track that is fit for the V8 supercars?
Wellington,3cmoen,captainbenis,4,Thu Jul 9 06:25:18 2015 UTC,"Well, the amateur motorsport here is mostly Hillclimbs, Street Sprints and that sort of thing. Basically timed events on closed down public roads.  Things like the Alexandra Road Hillclimb which goes up Mount Vic   And the Port Road Street Sprint, around Seaview   Shelly Bay Sprint around the back of Miramar  Or for really super entry level, I'm fond of the Trentham Autocross  In terms of higher end stuff if you want to go watch things, that's a bit harder, although there are some reasonably serious racing events at Manfield Park (a few hours drive out of Welly)  If you're willing to take a short flight/long drive, you can go watch serious international level stuff at Pukekohe or Highlands  Oh, and there is also Taupo Motorsport Park and Hampton Downs.  Hope that helps!"
Wellington,3cmoen,deathscreenofblue,2,Thu Jul 9 07:25:19 2015 UTC,I can quite often hear quite a lot of dirt racing in the hills behind Karori towards Brooklyn. A guy mentioned that there is some sort of track out there.

It was part of a huge public investment programme, which included the subway and airport extension - these weren't consequences of the Guggenheim.  2) The Guggenheim isn't universally loved by locals in Bilbao. It had questionable effects on the local art scene, and the gentrification pushed locals out of their homes.  3) Just because Gehry's museum in Bilbao was a success, doesn't mean the same thing would have happened in Wellington. You can't compare tourism pull in Europe and NZ.  4) And anyway, other than being functional, rather than attractive, Te Papa has been a massive success as a museum, which is it's primary role!

Easily walkable to the Beehive along the waterfront in 15 mins (depending where in Mt Vic you are).

Architecturally Wellington leaves alot to be desired, but if the weather holds then the waterfront is stunning, the best architectural stuff is probably at the parliament end of lambton quay in the north of the CBD.

It'll probably get us the budget surplus next year :p  Hopefully this isn't the only roading upgrade in Wellington as the SH2 queue at Ngauranga will probably be longer and start at an earlier time"
Wellington,3cguh3,thegolfer2,2,Tue Jul 7 21:14:05 2015 UTC,Especially since everyone will take the old hutt road once the cameras go up.
Wellington,3cguh3,323624915,2,Wed Jul 8 01:47:55 2015 UTC,Not really because it'll still be faster on the motorway than on Old Hutt Road.
Wellington,3cguh3,thegolfer2,2,Wed Jul 8 04:41:28 2015 UTC,"Maybe if you're going to the Hutt, but if the motorway is limited to 40km/h, most people who want to go up SH1 will probably take the old road."
Wellington,3cguh3,323624915,3,Wed Jul 8 05:01:44 2015 UTC,"And then the traffic problem on the motorway is fixed for a short while, freeing it up for a higher speed.   See how this works?"
Wellington,3cguh3,My_usrname_of_choice,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:14:45 2015 UTC,"Not really, the motorway stays congested for a while because SH2 is jammed, and the people going up the gorge have to filter through them. Old Hutt Road usually has a better ratio of SH1:SH2 and flows better, earlier.  In my experience anyway."
Wellington,3cguh3,323624915,2,Wed Jul 8 07:39:56 2015 UTC,"I suppose that having more cars on the motorway itself will allow the Ngauranga lights at the bottom of the Gorge to give a longer phase to those who exited SH2. I believe that the lights currently give too much time for north/south traffic so there is always a backlog of cars at the SH2 off ramp during the rush hours.  With the smart motorway, those heading up SH1 will have a clear run until the Paramata roundabout as the SH2 queue should only be on the two right hand lanes.  Personally, I would prefer to drive at a constant 40 rather than stop start traffic going 55ish.  From what I have heard, there might be a ramp signal on the SH2 Ngauranga onramp, so that'll be fairly interesting."

Wellington,3cguh3,KT88,9,Wed Jul 8 03:42:43 2015 UTC,"Yo, new trains etc notwithstanding, public transport is unreliable, slow, infrequent and badly designed.  The train doesn't even go to the fucking airport.  Let's not get into the cost!  People sit in traffic, 1 to a vehicle, because it's cheaper, easier, and usually faster.  Who can blame them?  I've got no problem with computer jobs, I'm just saying, that's the main reason for congestion."
Wellington,3cguh3,323624915,5,Wed Jul 8 03:52:55 2015 UTC,"To get the train in, it would be about a 1hr 10 min round trip. 10 minute walk to the bus stop, 15 mins to the station. 10 minute wait at the station. 25 minute train. 10 minute walk to work. Driving in? 25 minutes, 35 in traffic. For some people, time is important, that's an extra hour plus of time that could be spent working in the morning, or relaxing at home at the end of the day"
Wellington,3cguh3,SepDot,5,Wed Jul 8 04:33:07 2015 UTC,"Personally I'm all for it, the cost imposed on those who speed will be more than outweighed by the collective benefit of the many who get to work faster."
Wellington,3cguh3,SepDot,6,Tue Jul 7 21:51:40 2015 UTC,"The problem is, this doesn't change the fact that a huge majority of gridlock is caused by unconfident drivers who either follow WAY too close behind the car infront, or brake unnecessarily. It should help, but people need to be more aware of their effect on traffic."
Wellington,3cguh3,VisserThree,5,Tue Jul 7 22:00:24 2015 UTC,"Yeh, or the people who slow down to look at an accident on the other side of the road... I'm sure there are analysts who have studied the effect that this is likely to have, and logically it seems to make sense. Would love to see how it works in practise.

The camera is there to enforce that limit at the most dangerous area if one were travelling at 100kmh. I only think one thing about people who whine about speed cameras being revenue generators....You're butthurt that you don't get to speed.
Wellington,3cguh3,ianoftawa,4,Tue Jul 7 22:27:24 2015 UTC,"I drive that road at least twice a day, every day.  100km/h is a perfectly reasonable speed for the road, even in the wet.    It has the busiest speed camera in the southern hemisphere because right as the road starts to go downhill, and widens out, they cut 20km/h off the speed limit! Even though the vast majority of collisions are rush hour nose to tails under 20km/h.  And if all of that wasn't transparent enough, Rimutaka Hill Road is 100km/h, figure that out!

I used NZTA's crash analysis system with an extent between newlands off ramp and tires road (actually 1200 m) in southbound direction. For Horokiwi I used northbound 1200 m extent south of the Wellington-Hutt city boundary. Horokiwi has slightly higher traffic volumes by memory."
Wellington,3cguh3,ycnz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:43:17 2015 UTC,"It's also had many many changes made to it since it was 100kmh. Plus, I don't see anything wrong with revenue gathering from speeders.

Wellington,3chx52,theg33kshow,2,Thu Jul 9 04:06:04 2015 UTC,"OK, there's a couple of really cheap and simple tricks that can extend the life of your razors by a massive factor (a pack of 4 cartridges lasts me about 4-6 months).  Most of the ""wear"" on your razor comes from corrosion of the edge, not being blunted by your (manly) beard hair. Instead of just leaving your wet razor out to corrode, shake off the water and keep it in a sealed plastic box with a load of rice. the rice will absorb any moisture and keep the blade dry and corrosion free.   To keep a great edge, you can cut a strop from some old jeans and strop your razor on denim. works a treat."

Not sure of dates yet because we're not trying to make this into a big deal since we're both expats. BUT, we do want to have a party after coming from the courts and we do intend on making the whole thing memorable. I know this wouldn't be the most formal wedding, but we just thought, ""hey, if he's up for it, why not?"" So yeah."
Wellington,3cd816,odiwankenobi,7,Tue Jul 7 09:55:08 2015 UTC,"I don't want you to feel like this is a dig at your enthusiasm but you have to remember that weddings are not like any other event.   For the vast majority of people - they are willing to pay a lot to get the results they want because it's a once-in-a-lifetime matter that needs to be captured to the nth degree.   I am not a videographer myself but I have worked at many weddings over the last few years as a DJ and photographer (not at the same time), and I can assure you there's a reason why the videographers charge so much.   My advice is for you is to approach the videographers in town and ask to intern/work under them with their guidance and mentorship. If you're willing to work free for a wedding, you may as well take that same approach to working under someone else. This process allows you to really see what it means to work as a videographer and help you realise that even in smaller weddings, a single person is not sufficient to capture everything on the day."
Wellington,3cd816,c0nc0n,6,Tue Jul 7 04:50:59 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agree. There is indeed a reason they charge so much, and I'm not going to pretend as though I can immediately replicate their quality without experience. I think, however, there are a number of people who would happily go without a videographer on their wedding day, and I guess I'm hoping one of them will be willing to take a chance. In terms of approaching other videographers - again I absolutely agree, and this is something I've been starting to do."

Not dressing up with cats.   It wasn't cringe because of the ideology of cat rescue, it was cringe because of worry about people's perceptions and fear of not being socially adept / humiliation. It's such a huge concern and takes up so much mental real estate that it's actually being projected onto other people.   Like I said, being so worried about what other people think of you that your vicarious embarrassment pushes you into trying to shame other people in order to deflect potential humiliation away from yourself is a shitty way to go through life.  It's a recipe for keeping yourself from enjoying life because all your can do is worry about if what you're doing is cool enough. Or doing shit you don't even like because not doing it would be uncool or cringe inducing."

Things that come to mind that have been done previously: tenpin bowling, rock climbing, dinners, movies, board games, bubble soccer, indoor soccer, bar crawls... And I've only been here a short while!  With enough warning I'm sure people will come!   Also if you're looking to meet people try meetup.com, there are some really cool groups on there.

Wellington,3boh9r,ValNZ,4,Tue Jun 30 23:07:04 2015 UTC,"It's a crazy system.  I don't understand why they don't just tell everyone to register with payment details before $datetime then do a lotto between everyone registered.  If your payment fails you immediately lose out to someone else.  The website wouldn't get crushed.  It would be fairer on those unable to queue for hours in the freezing cold.  Edit - and no worse than the current online ""lotto"" that depends on how shitty their website is responding."

Wellington,3blmna,daffyflyer,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:04:04 2015 UTC,"Because some ~2002 onwards Subarus (I think specifically 2.0l Legacies) have a weird electronic throttle bug that makes them respond really slowly to sudden throttle inputs.  Like scary slow ""nail the throttle and then count to 2"" sort of delay.  Common wisdom is that resetting the ecu's self learning functions by pulling the battery for a while can fix it. Though I beleive there was a dealer recall for a more serious fix.  Subarus are not particularly bad cars, but they do have some unique problems to be aware of, and like all cars if they're not maintained and repaired properly, they can get expensive.  And as someone else mentioned, the engine layout does make things like leads, spark plugs etc. a right bastard of a job."

Biol 111, 113, 114 are all cool and pretty easy to teach. With the new term starting soon, I'm sure they'll be looking for people. My advice would be to find out who is running the classes (the only one I can remember off the top of my head is that Phil Lester runs 114) and go have a chat with them. Alternatively, your supervisor might run some 2nd or 3rd year papers you could get in on. Hit them up. Teaching looks good on the CV too! Good luck =)"

You can choose from a huge range of designer frames from the worldâ€™s leading brands such as Bvlgari, Burberry, Coach, Dolce & Gabbana, Miu Miu, Oakley, Oliver Peoples, Oroton, Police, Prada, Ralph Lauren, Ray-Ban, Tiffany & Co, Versace and Vogue.   But I can't see any in their online stock, however they do have at least most of the rest of those names.  Personally think it's odd to choose by brand, just because they design something that looks good, doesn't mean they've designed something that will look good on me. Had so much trouble last time I tried to find frames that suited me..."
Wellington,3bbc5f,JeChercheWally,3,Sat Jun 27 21:02:58 2015 UTC,"I'll take a look at OPSM. Thanks.  I'm mostly looking by brand because I think the build quality is better than the standard frames you get at say, a Specsavers. Plus, like I say, I'm a bit of a snob and prefer a higher end frame."
Wellington,3bbc5f,chimpwithalimp,2,Sat Jun 27 23:54:16 2015 UTC,A redditor you've met a few dozen times works at OPSM.
Wellington,3bbc5f,thisshakingearth,2,Sun Jun 28 01:49:22 2015 UTC,"I spent a year waiting to find the perfect frames in New Zealand, it's important to be snobby and find the best ones for you. I wanted Oliver Peoples and found them at Woodward Opticians, then they showed me Lewis Fredricks. These glasses were handcrafted from buffalo horn that's a biproduct of the Chinese dairy industry. Also because they're a natural fibre they gradually flex and fit your face perfectly and specifically. One of the best things about them is they're made in Wellington. Be sure to check the out before you decide, especially as they just added new horns and frames. http://lewisfredericks.co.nz/"
Wellington,3bbc5f,thisshakingearth,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:58:31 2015 UTC,"Woah, thanks so much! Just at a quick glance a few of those Lewis Fredricks styles look wonderful and may just be what I'm looking for!   Any inclination on price at all? Are they similar to say, Oliver Peoples or because they're made in Wellington is price a premium?  Thanks so much for the suggestion though. Peoples got style in Wellington!"
Wellington,3bbc5f,redacteduserid,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:08:55 2015 UTC,"No worries! I have never felt passionate about a pair of glasses before haha.  They're expensive, mine were about $700 including lenses. That was when they had just entered the market, so I'm not sure if they've gone up. They have a few retailers around Wellington so I'd suggest looking around a few.   The people at Woodward were so accommodating and really endeavoured to help me find the perfect frame, I tried on so many different brands. The best thing about my experience there was the fact that I expressed I had previously been unsatisfied with eye tests, especially when I usually wear the same pair of glasses for around 3 years, and they gave me such a thorough test. Really made sure everything was working for me, so I definitely recommend going and checking them out before making any decisions"
Wellington,3bbc5f,brdubu,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:28:07 2015 UTC,"Well, I really didn't think I'd get that many responses to a boring ol' specs question, so I'm glad you feel as passionate about frames as me!  I'll check Woodward out. I've been wearing the same specs for about three years now I think, so it's definitely time to upgrade and get a thorough test done (another plus point of what you mentioned). $700 is probably a little more than I'd want to spend, but then again if I can find frames which really suit me and have fantastic build quality, I'd probably cough up the dough.

What sort of things are you hoping will change or be different at a new school?  You're probably going to need to decide on a few areas that you might live in so the potential schools can be narrowed down. When you have decided on that, it's worth ringing around a few schools and talking through your situation. It'll quickly be clear the schools that will be better suited to your daughter.

Wellington,3at2yn,spahrnge,2,Tue Jun 23 21:51:23 2015 UTC,"You can, but it's a long long long long walk. At least 12 hours at a good pace. And then you have to get back from Makara Beach, which is a good hour or two walk to South Karori. It's not a winter route. You'll either have to do some scrambling to get past certain parts without swimming, or take an overland route through Terawhiti Station, for which you'll need permission. Remember that most of the land up there is private: Terawhiti Station and the wind farm. Basically you can get all the way round to the cable landing station without getting your feet wet, but from that point on you'll have to do some climbing, either inland or scrambling across the rocks at the beach."
Wellington,3at2yn,mwhudsondoyle,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:47:55 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, the fact that the land that way is private and not easily accessible is what makes it interesting :-) Thanks for the info.

Wellington,3at2yn,Wildzooz,2,Wed Jun 24 22:18:36 2015 UTC,"I've walked to Oteranga Bay and back in a day starting in Island Bay. Beyond Red Rocks it's mostly walking on sand, which is a difficult surface for long-distance walking since your feet sink into it.

(for example: ""USA Freedom Beer crawl - 7pm 4th July - Southern Cross)  Preferably use a meetup indicator like a sign or something, or else give a clear description of who to look for. People will go! Making several ""maybe"" topics won't get much interest. I think people want to know for sure either way if it's on or they won't leave the house.

I would be keen to install it off the disc, BUT as i just said, windows website said my product key is in use/won't recognise it. So would that even work? I don't want to wipe my laptop and risk it if it might not! Is there anything else that would work? Sorry to turn this is into an IT help thread, just had no idea what my options were."
Wellington,3at2ax,123felix,10,Tue Jun 23 09:10:01 2015 UTC,"First, and easiest step: Ring the number that's listed on the activation screen. The process cocks it up plenty of times when you're rebuilding a PC, and they're quite used to dealing with the situation."

Wellington,3at2ax,Default_WLG,3,Tue Jun 23 08:55:23 2015 UTC,"from where?   ;)  How you get the install ISO doesn't matter, as long as the key is good then you'll be fine."
Wellington,3at2ax,DontBeMoronic,4,Tue Jun 23 10:54:33 2015 UTC,"The product key on the bottom of the laptop is an OEM key, so it will only work on OEM copies of Windows,"
Wellington,3at2ax,Jazilulyn,2,Tue Jun 23 08:54:23 2015 UTC,"As a follow up to this, I'm pretty sure that Microsoft won't let you download an OEM copy of Windows 7 (i.e. the install ISO) directly from them, so you have to acquire the ISO elsewhere if you want to use your legit OEM key. If you have a retail key, then you can get the ISO from Microsoft."

Wellington,3at2ax,DontBeMoronic,2,Wed Jun 24 03:51:03 2015 UTC,You could download the Windows 10 preview? That will go legit when it's released if you're a tester.
Wellington,3at2ax,DontBeMoronic,2,Tue Jun 23 19:13:58 2015 UTC,"Windows 10 Insider will be free and genuine if you're in the program. You won't get a free license key to the official, final Windows 10 release. There will be a timeframe where you can use an official license key with the Preview and just stay on the official release, otherwise you'll continue with testing. The quicker release schedule seems like it's here to stay, and Microsoft will ""reward"" testers for their feedback by not charging anything for those installs.  Clarification here."

Wellington,3ap4qa,c0nc0n,2,Thu Jun 25 09:50:59 2015 UTC,Sounds like one of two things - your locking mechanism (effectively is effectively a slider) is worn e.g. the gearing teeth moving the slider has slipped or your door barrel is a bit borked. The first one is easier to solve because you can take your door card off and you can then see the mechanism move every time you lock and unlock the door.

Wellington,3antjh,air_ben,4,Mon Jun 22 01:07:45 2015 UTC,"We're pretty good for both wind and solar, but you should start thinking tens of thousands, rather than thousands or hundreds."
Wellington,3antjh,ycnz,4,Mon Jun 22 03:57:26 2015 UTC,My house is on the market now and I am planning to go off grid when I move to Welly. One of the many reasons why I chose Wellington was because of the wind.   My advice if money is small is to experiment and start small. You can get small windmill kits and use it to feed a small charger to a car battery that you use to charge your phone.   If you wanted to get super tight ass with it you could build your own windmill and with the help of some gearing/pully options you could use a car alternator from the wreckers. But don't expect it to be too efficient.
Wellington,3antjh,chimpwithalimp,3,Mon Jun 22 01:41:20 2015 UTC,"I honestly do get the idea of going off grid, and other countries are doing it with various successes, but I think the cost in NZ is a prohibitor. Another poster suggested maybe running a scrap alternator, gears and pulleys, and charge your phone and stuff like that. Probably the entire cost of charging my phone for the last twelve months via a socket in the wall was $20, and that's at a very high guess. If I had a choice of paying that or running a scrapyard on my roof and garden, I'd take the simple option.  One day it'll make a huge amount of sense to go off grid and to be utterly self reliant, but I don't think that time is yet. Then again if a big quake comes, you can charge your neighbours $10 a pop to use your junk car/pulley phone charger, and who'll be laughing then?"
Wellington,3antjh,worklederp,3,Mon Jun 22 04:40:47 2015 UTC,"I think I get what you mean, but it's never been about going off the grid. I'm more interested in taking the edge off the electricity bill (maybe I should just do gas?). If I can heat the hot water while the southerly screams by, that feels like a big win"
Wellington,3antjh,caswal,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:51:47 2015 UTC,"You could install a second element in your hot water tank and power it off a turbine (maybe with a super high-temp cutoff) So your normal hot-water heating can push it up to 55 and the turbine can push it to 70, etc. Setting it up would be a pain in the ass, but at least this way, if you get a low-voltage element, you don't need inverters, batteries, etc"

Wellington,3antjh,ComeAlongPonds,2,Mon Jun 22 05:13:51 2015 UTC,"Although it's pricing of $10000 per kW of capacity seems pretty far off.

Surely larger means less leverage etc so generates far more?  Small-scale/residential will never hit that level of efficiency/capture... I remember reading somewhere that the (massive) towers for full size wind farms are still too small for the optimal blade.  I wonder if the blades ever come off them?  :)"
Wellington,3antjh,sacredsnowhawk,2,Mon Jun 22 08:25:49 2015 UTC,"If you're considering exporting energy back to the grid, you'll need to contact your electricity supplier in regards to their + network requirements. You'll need at one new meter installed depending on your current supply tariff."

Not sure how to spot me to be honest! I've got a pink scarf, and a pink and beige backpack, and the rest is mostly black.

Wellington,3a8szr,chimpwithalimp,2,Thu Jun 18 07:09:26 2015 UTC,you too. Next time you're down make a post and we could try and do a proper meetup! :)
Wellington,3a8syv,Guntaaah,3,Thu Jun 18 03:22:16 2015 UTC,"Wellington city has a bunch of walks: City to Sea (Island Bay to the City), the Skyline walk (Karori to the City), Te Ahumairangi walkway (around Tinakori/Thorndon), the Mount Vic loop (er, Mount Vic). There's a beach walk out to Red Rocks, where there's seals, and a whole bunch of tracks along the higher ground around the south coast. There's also some serious walking to be done within Otari-Wilton's Bush. You can see some outstanding views from just within the CBD. All of these have good public transport links.  http://wellington.govt.nz/recreation/enjoy-the-outdoors/walks-and-walkways  If you want to get the train out to Porirua, there's some great ones: Whitireia Park and Colonial Knob are the two longer ones that spring to mind. Even further out, but easily accessible by train, we've got walks around Pukerua Bay, Paekakariki, around QE2 park and the Marine Memorial, and up in Paraparaumu. I heard the Paekakariki Escarpment track is a good one, but I haven't had a chance to check it out.  I would check them out thoroughly before you set foot on them. Some of them, like the escarpment track, are designed for experienced walkers. Even the city tracks can have sheer drops and even bluffs. In the weather we're having at the moment, you could find yourself in trouble on a track that's less than a few km from town.   Remember, weather in NZ changes quickly, and Wellington can be vicious. It's not impossible to get stuck, or to get lost a few metres from the track. Wellington has some really dense bush. Sometimes if you get in, you're not getting out for a while. So yeah. Even if it's sunny, at this time of year be prepared."
Wellington,3a8syv,spahrnge,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:04:58 2015 UTC,"Wow thats a lot! In the past months iÂ´ve done Tongariro and the Kepler track, So do you think there are any comparable daywalks around, because when I get back home, I wont be able to see any mountains anymore"
Wellington,3a8syv,spahrnge,5,Thu Jun 18 04:13:37 2015 UTC,"Nothing like those. Tararua country is remote country, for most tracks you need backcountry skills. I don't want to sound negative, but this is winter, and I don't want you trigger a LandSAR event or to die based on something I didn't tell you, or something I didn't make clear. It's the shortest day of the year in three days. You have about eight hours of useful daylight. The Tararuas aren't like the well maintained well travelled tracks like the Great Walks. Most of the tracks are advanced, relatively unmaintained. Honestly, if there's two places in NZ that you're going to die walking, it's either on the West Coast or up in the Tararuas. They're not on the tourist trail, they're hard to get in or out of and they're subject to crazy weather rolling in from the Tasman. Don't let the great walks lull you into a false sense of security about what NZ backcountry can be like.  It depends how experienced you are. There's an entrance to the Tararuas at Kaitoke in Upper Hutt, or one at Otaki Forks. But no public transport. Trains going Otaki way stop at Waikanae. And even if you got to Otaki, it's another 15km or so to Otaki Forks. I heard you can get a taxi, but don't quote me on that. The only reason you could go, unless you have a lot of experience and someone to give your intentions to, is for Field Hut and Table Top.  The Rimutaka Forest Park is probably a bit gentler. If you check out the Pencarrow Lighthouse walk, the Catchpool and Orongorongo Valley, that'll take you to the southern end of the Rimutaka Forest Park. (Same warnings apply there though. A few weeks ago, when a race was on in the park, a runner got lost and had to spend a night in the bush. That's despite hundreds of people being all over the track.) That walk just out to the lighthouse is about 8km, so it's a while just to get out there, but once you're there there's a day to be spent around the lakes if the weather's good.  Just, if you're going to do day walks outside the city, remember to stay safe. Let someone know your intentions, check the weather, go prepared, know where you're going and know your limits. And then it'll still be an exhilarating experience. :D"
Wellington,3a8syv,ratguy,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:07:13 2015 UTC,I've been on the Paekakariki Escarpment track a few times now. Last time I was up there was earlier in the summer and it had not yet been completed. It is very easy to access from the Paekakariki train station. Very level for the first few km's and then climbs quite abruptly for around a km before leveling off again. The views from up on top on a clear day are very nice. I could see all the way up to Ruapehu. Right now it's just out and back but when it's complete you'll be able to go all the way through to the old Muri Station and from there it's a short walk to Pukerua Bay Station. Should make a very nice loop.
Wellington,3a8syv,spahrnge,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:45:13 2015 UTC,"If it's going to drop you down at Muri, that means it links up with the coastal walk to Plimmerton, right? Because that'd be a real good walk if you get the train up to Paekak and then work your way back to Porirua."
Wellington,3a8syv,ratguy,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:51:42 2015 UTC,"That could be done easily. Just walk from Muri Station to the overbridge at Wairaka Road. Cross the motorway there, then take Wairaka to Rawhiti, turn right there and at the end of Rawhiti take the Goat Track down to the beach. Then just follow that all the way round to Plimmerton. I live near the end of Rawhiti and have done this walk before. Lovely walk, but the sections along the beach are all loose gravel which is very tiring to walk in. Was very thankful to get onto a roadway again."

Wellington,3a8syv,mwhudsondoyle,2,Thu Jun 18 04:43:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think it'll be easy to get into the tararuas by public transport. You could look at the tramping clubs or the meetup groups and see if there is a walk you could get onto. As others have said, there is a whole lot of stuff around the city though, and some of the regional parks are accessible-ish by public transport."
Wellington,3a8syv,MAIM_KILL_BURN,2,Thu Jun 18 09:45:09 2015 UTC,"It's kinda shit, but the best day walks aren't reached by public transport - which is the Orongorongos (Rimutaka Forest Park) and if you are more advanced the Tararuas.  I can highly recommend the Orongorongos (for example the Mt McKerrow loop, or combine it with the Cattle Ridge/Butcher's track) as some of the finest daywalks in Wellington.  But there isn't a hell of a lot of public transport to get out to Wainuiomata.  The Tararuas are a different kettle of fish.  The tracks are really primitive and most were cut by 19th century hunters who had no concept of track building, so they go up steeply without any switchbacks.  Also a neat fact of the Tararua tops is that they are 280 days of the year in storm conditions - that means 100+ kph winds and visibility absorbing cloud.  I consider myself experienced but every time I go into the Tararuas I feel like I've been tested.  Most of the tracks in the Tararuas inveriably lead to the exposed mountain tops, and this time of year anything goes.  Having said that, some possibilities are: Otaki Forks - Kime Hut, or Table Top -> Penn Creek hut.  Or, Kiriwhakapapa Rd - Blue Range Hut -> Cow Creek hut.  Or, Holdsworth carpark -> Atiwhakatu Hut, and then see what the weather's like, Baldy and/or Mitre is sort of doable from there.  But you really need your own transport to get to any of the Tararua roadends.  Soooooooo yeah.  I hear Zealandia is great for a casual daywalk though? :D"
Wellington,3a8syv,zorkmids,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:29:28 2015 UTC,"There was snow and 100+ km/h winds on the tops of the Tararuas last weekend.  So unless you're experienced and well prepared, stay below the tree line.   Unprepared trampers routinely die in the Tararuas. Having said that, the Jumbo Holdsworth circuit is a great route"

Wellington,3a842w,workingaroundit,1 point,Fri Jun 19 09:18:03 2015 UTC,The bikes everyone rides are a mixture of a dedicated cyclocross bike or a mountain bike of any variety. Road bike is really not suitable as you won't be able to fit tires with any traction whatsoever. But basically if it has two wheels and no motor we don't care. To be honest we are probably flexible on the two wheel part as well.  Anyone and everyone are welcome! There is three separately run grades for different fitness levels. Attire is probably a 70/30 split of lycra to baggy clothing. The community really isn't snobbish so there is little or no judging on ones attire or bike.

This gets you a connection in the profession, and a character reference. But it also isn't paid work.  Hit up WINZ and see if there are any apprenticeships going, they'll have a pretty good idea of how to point you in the right direction.  Got any family in the industry? Is your uncles mate's brother-in-law a cabinet maker? Having that connection to vouch for you is a good start.  Polytechs do short basics courses, so that'll give you an advantage over complete newbies, and you'll gain tool knowledge, basic joins, how to hit a nail.

Wellington,3a4xpz,sitharus,3,Mon Jun 22 20:24:35 2015 UTC,"What sort of visit is it? Minor surgery or just some medication?  Someone posted a list of GP prices here a few weeks back, I'll see if I can find it. But without being a citizen/resident you're looking at $80ish for a consult and ~$180 for surgery.  Edit: Here's a list of all GPs in the Wellington region, some have websites with prices."
Wellington,3a4xpz,sitharus,2,Wed Jun 17 08:26:22 2015 UTC,"Hey this was super helpful, thanks a bunch. And just a checkup, hopefully no medication and definitely not surgery ha, unless something catastrophic happens."
Wellington,3a4xpz,sitharus,2,Thu Jun 18 02:25:39 2015 UTC,"It's very unusual to see a doctor in NZ unless you have an underlying medical problem or something obviously in need of treatment, or are over 50 or under 16.  If you don't think it'll need medication you could probably see the practice nurse - it'll be cheaper."

Wellington,3a4xpz,sitharus,5,Wed Jun 17 08:58:45 2015 UTC,"Not it isn't. They might be able to rectify their uninsured status with at least a basic travel insurance. I have seen people need medical flights home that cost 1000s, its just not worth the risk, ever. Not to mention that as a tax payer we cop their bill when they skip home without paying their bill.   ""I love your city/country... but I'm willing to leave a huge debt in your already stretched medical system"""

Wellington,3a4xpz,Miss_Meltymel,-1,Thu Jun 18 02:21:28 2015 UTC,"And unhelpful second paragraph, that's probably the most expensive GP in the city. Just ring newtown medical and if they can't fit you in, ask who they recommend.  Holy shit lady, that wasn't very helpful of you."
Wellington,3a4xpz,Miss_Meltymel,8,Wed Jun 17 09:43:50 2015 UTC,"Yes please do ring the most busy practice in Wellington because it is a low income access practice servicing a large population base.   OP wants non-urgent medical attention, he does not need to save a few dollars and take up space in an already over stretched service, taking the spot for a possible more urgent case that can not afford a holiday in another country let a lone afford a Dr in their own city.   OP should use WAHMC, not a low-cost GP practice.   If OP needs to shop around for a Dr to save $20-50 for a Dr visit because it is going to break OPs bank, he shouldn't be on holiday uninsured in NZ."

Wellington,3a4xpz,Miss_Meltymel,-4,Thu Jun 18 02:19:00 2015 UTC,"What ever, your post clearly says, free/cheap drop in, to save you money, because of your choice to not have insurance.  NZ is not free health care, you expecting free or cheap care just adds to the limited stretched resources we already have to help our own people in need, not to help some tourist. So act as righteous as you choose, you are not fooling me. How would you respond to an NZer in the USA looking for free health care, you would laugh in their face. You are just embarrassed for being called out, try to save face all you like, but we all know the truth here."

Wellington,39seub,gareths_neighbour,2,Sun Jun 14 08:30:16 2015 UTC,"I would look in particular to develop your skills/experience in the web side of things as that will suit the hours you can work. There are several less technical areas you could get into with your current skillset and potentially build into a career on the side:   Copy writing - there is solid demand for this, but writing for the web is different from print, so there are things to learn.  Social media - When done professionally, essentially PR and communications online. Business development / client management - Your government contacts and comms experience could be an asset to some, though this would be harder to pull off as a second job (unless dealing with clients in other timezones)."
Wellington,39seub,miasmic,1 point,Sun Jun 14 10:45:49 2015 UTC,"thanks - looking up some of the ""work from home"" type threads in Reddit - writing for Search Engine Optimisation seems to be a common theme which I might investigate more.   I think I'll try to find the appropriate channels to put myself out there offering some services as you suggest and see if there's any bites.  Also investigating doing ESOL tutoring online which I can fit into my schedule which could be good.  Thanks!"

Wellington,39omnr,redacteduserid,4,Sun Jun 14 06:36:44 2015 UTC,"Spotted them at Chaffers last night and wondered what they were doing.  They ignored me which I found interesting. I might have come out at the wrong time, but they seemed to be picking and choosing who they were approaching, which isn't really the done thing (survey participants should be picked at random for best results).  You can always ask for their ethics statement if they approach you. If they have one, it should tell you who they are surveying on behalf of, why, what they'll do with the info, and their methodology.  If they don't have one, I'd refuse to complete it."
Wellington,39omnr,ScenesJeff,2,Sun Jun 14 10:33:10 2015 UTC,"Ignored me as well when I walked past liquor king, approached and offered to me when I left New World.  I'm an early 20s white male student, so I guess if you are as well, we're not their target demographic (or won't give them the results they want)."

Wellington,39pcjd,siximpossiblethings,4,Sat Jun 13 13:14:37 2015 UTC,"I use to be involved in full swing. I never took any of the classes (I learned elsewhere), but I've heard the instructors are good and they seem like good people.  If you can't make the regular lessons you can always do privates (hopefully they're not too expensive).  Wellington also has a huge Tango scene with a lot of instructors (or varying quality). You can probably find a group class between all of them; much more variety than the swing dance instructors."
Wellington,39pcjd,djsumdog,3,Mon Jun 15 14:28:15 2015 UTC,Christchurch lindyhopper who is considering moving to Wellington here. Check out Fullswing. They have a range of classes several days a week. Address is on Cuba street I believe.

Wellington,39ofye,chimpwithalimp,3,Sat Jun 13 06:18:28 2015 UTC,"I think this one was too big, it says that Argentine ants are around 2-3mm while this one was around 10mm."

Wellington,39ofye,morphinedreams,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:26:15 2015 UTC,"No. The Argentine ant has a very different body shape around the abdomen.  Could be a striated worker ant, but the colour is off. It's probably a native species based on its shape."
Wellington,39ofye,JeChercheWally,5,Sat Jun 13 07:27:21 2015 UTC,"You can ask Te Papa, they appear to have resources in that link to help you identify it yourself too.  Edit: Had a quick skim, this seems to be the best thing that might help. (Took me a while to figure out where the links to continue are after you've clicked Run Key, so to save you having a potential derp moment, it's the numbers to the right.)"
Wellington,39ofye,morphinedreams,2,Sat Jun 13 06:56:40 2015 UTC,"Photo is too small to determine species (to rule out or confirm a NZ species). Did you manage to grab a specimen sample, and if not where was it taken? I live in Kapiti and if it's within easy travel distance I might see if I can find similar species for identification in Vic's labs.  Edit: Looking at the ant's shape it looks like it belongs to myrmecia, which is restricted almost entirely to NZ/Australia. Thus, it probably is a native species, or at the very least a naturalised non-native.  Edit2: Thank you for expressing concern! As an ecologist public involvement in identifying species that they think might be invasive and undocumented in the country is hugely important, especially considering our customs biocontrol and conservation departments keep losing funding."
Wellington,39ofye,Rags2Rickius,1 point,Sat Jun 13 07:21:44 2015 UTC,"I didn't grab a specimen (silly me), and I haven't seen any others around yet. It was near my house so I'll make sure to get one if I manage to spot another."
Wellington,39nxzx,flat_wheel,8,Sat Jun 13 02:56:17 2015 UTC,"I can't guarantee it will work, but write a formal letter, (not an email) explaining that the registration is on hold/no wof and why it was on the street, and send it to the enforcement agency via snail mail. They are much more likely to wave the fine if you can formally explain your reasons and its sent via post."

Wellington,39nxzx,VulpesNZ,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:16:01 2015 UTC,Can confirm this worked for me in a very similar situation.

Wellington,39nxzx,DontBeMoronic,5,Sat Jun 13 04:18:38 2015 UTC,Unfortunately I don't think you'll be let off that fine.  Technically your car is only allowed on the road (and this includes being parked) without a WoF when its on its way to be tested or repaired.  And even then you can get grief about that...  I think the same stands for the registration.  I'm pretty sure Exemption is the same as unregistered in this situation.  Googling around for answers seems to show the same experience.
Wellington,39nxzx,chimpwithalimp,3,Sat Jun 13 03:43:06 2015 UTC,"This is the most likely outcome.  Technically the car is not allowed on the public road, even just parked out the way on a quiet one.  Bad luck OP, an hour or two probably would have gone unnoticed :(  But you never know, maybe whoever opens the letter is in a reallllllly good mood.  Try posting it so it'll arrive on a Friday?  (And hope it's opened same day, not left for the bad mood that is Monday)"
Wellington,39nxzx,Eldritch101,4,Sat Jun 13 04:54:46 2015 UTC,"Awesome, well those fines sure will help keep our roads safer. The car port repairs are still going to take a week or so more, can they fine my car again as it's still on the street?"
Wellington,39nxzx,chimpwithalimp,12,Sat Jun 13 04:10:52 2015 UTC,"Can you disguise the car?    Paint it like a hearse and take to sleeping in the back 24/7 dressed in a cheap suit with coins on your eyes (bonus: relaxing)  Paint jovial animals on the side and play loud jingly music, handing free ice creams to all who approach (risky and expensive) Affix a large robotic arm to the roof and fill the boot with rancid garbage (only works on bin days) Stand on the roof and fixedly pretend it's a skateboard, staring into the middle distance and holding a surfing pose all morning (this only works if you commit to the illusion)   Alternate these suggestions daily until carport is fixed"

Wellington,39nxzx,Astaro,7,Tue Jun 30 00:30:06 2015 UTC,Yes and they probably will since your street is obviously checked. Do you know someone with a spot off road you can park at? Or leave the ticket under your wiper and pray they leave you alone because they see the ticket.

Wellington,39nxzx,SepDot,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:46:10 2015 UTC,"As long as it is on the road, they can ticket it. If you can't find somewhere else to park the car, you could try renting a transport trailer, loading the car onto it, and parking the trailer on the road. It's going to cost more than the car's worth to do that for a week though."
Wellington,39nxzx,sebdacat,2,Mon Jun 15 03:13:42 2015 UTC,is there not information on the back of the ticket about how you can protest a fine?
