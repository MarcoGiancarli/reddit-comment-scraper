MrRobot,3e1yiu,__ah6,4,Tue Jul 21 15:09:40 2015 UTC,"Well didn't they say that this mountain was completly off the grid. Implying that you couldn't hack it from the outside at all.  The way I assumed Elliot's Pi would work is by connecting to their ethernet on site, and bridging it via a 3g dongle or something. I think there was a  german bank heist that did something similair recently.  Or didn't he talk about connecting the Pi directly to a cooling unit or something? That way you wouldn't even need a network connection. Only a pi with a time delayed exploit just waiting to set off. Like a virus bomb."

Very rarely will individual machines be accessible from WAN in a corporate environment.

One interesting thing to think about, though, is how many movies Edward Norton has been in where he played someone with multiple personalities.  I can think of Primal Fear, Fight Club, The Incredible Hulk... and another one I can't remember, hmm."
MrRobot,3e4av3,Cyfun06,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:25:04 2015 UTC,I can't remember either.  I loved the twist at the end of PF though. I was fairly young so it caught me way off guard.   His character in American History X learned a new personality too haha.   He was also smoochy but I don't think he was split personality in that.

MrRobot,3e4av3,frahm9,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:22:57 2015 UTC,I guess the whole Fight Club thing is because the show has a lot of Fincher in it. Cinematography and so on.

MrRobot,3e1eqc,claipo,2,Tue Jul 21 14:41:49 2015 UTC,He's just messing around since half the discussions surrounding the show revolve around whether or not people are actually real.
MrRobot,3e1eqc,zer0knowledge,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:44:33 2015 UTC,That's why he looks so damn familiar! Cool Lester smooth.   Wonder what the bottom of Romeros shoes look like.
MrRobot,3e1eqc,blueliner25,4,Tue Jul 21 20:02:48 2015 UTC,You'll have to forgive it but Romero's name hasn't been mentioned once(I think).   Trenton is somewhat new and her name has only been said a handful of times and doesn't seem that important(so far in comparison to lets say mr. robot or angie)   So you should be somewhat understanding if people refer to certain characters by their features that make them most different to others.
MrRobot,3e1eqc,scoops__,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:06:23 2015 UTC,I'm secretly hoping this is a nod to John Romero

That's because Mr. Robot is yet another in an endless jet-stream of shitty corporate bootlicking propaganda shows, furnished for consumption primarily by the already heavily weakened brains of dumbed-down Americans. A show where anarchist hackers are painted as psychologically fucked up half-junkies struggling with morphine addiction. Where ""ethical"" hacking groups like Anonymous are painted as outright psychopathic terrorists who're more than willing to murder people in order to get back at capitalism (don't forget how fsociety is manipulating the show's protagonist so that he too can become an evil anti-American ""terrorist""). And where CEO's are eventually painted as ""innocent victims"" of misplaced hacker-anger. If and when they do mention Bitcoin on the show, YOU CAN BE 100% SURE that it will be demonized as a ""terrorist tool"" as well. Hackers don't say ""fuck society"". They say ""fuck the psychopaths who manipulate and destabilize it."""

Bitcoins were dirt cheap. A guy who was doing a report on them spent $30 for 5,000 or so bitcoins.   They gained price fast.   Within a few years, that guy had a small fortune on his hands when he rediscovered it. Bitcoins have been priced over $1000 per at some points in the past few years.   Many people saw what happened to the price.   They expect digital currency to soar someday, with bitcoins at its head. They expect the press and general public to exalt bitcoins, and give them tens of thousands of dollars on their $100-$200 investments.   But when the press or media doesn't exalt bitcoins, they get their panties in a huge ass twist."

Can anyone honestly say there is any profession/skill out there that doesn't have drug addicts? What's the more interesting story... a bank manager who is an upstanding citizen or a bank manager who is addicted to drugs and has to start stealing to cover his habit?  We don't watch TV and movies to see the most standard version of something, we want the extreme and unusual so of course your main character is going to have more to him than just one dimension.  I just never got this argument like ""omg the main bad guy was a different race than the lead so that must mean they think ____ race is evil."" I didn't watch Ip Man 2 and think ""Omg!! the chinese hate all westerners and think we are evil!"" I thought ""here is a character(s) that is bad.""

People like these disregard other's opinion and other schools of thought because of incredibly strong inferiority complex.

Why would a guy that has a hard time talking to people buy drugs in person from a dealer instead of buying it from the darknet and having it shipped to his house or PO box. It's not that bitcoin itself wasn't mentioned, but it just doesn't seem realistic for him to go this route and not the TOR and darknet market route in general. I mean Elliot obviously knows how to work TOR, he could have taught his dealer how to buy drugs off the darknet and get rid of her abusive supplier.  The way the group tries to cause chaos deleting credit records also wouldn't work with bitcoin as its ledger is replicated around the world thousands of times. You take one down there's thousands of others with ""backups"" It takes power away from the banking industry which I'm sure the top 1% of the 1% have some influence over. It fits the theme of fuck society.  Maybe bitcoin hasn't been invented yet, and the crash parallels the crash we had here in the U.S. a few years back.

Because when you believe you're constantly being watched by men in black, you can be pretty sure they're reading your fucking mail and might even be tampering with it. At some point, the paranoia overwhelms the social anxiety and you either don't do drugs or you find a convenient local source. Elliot obviously didn't feel like not doing drugs was an option, as apparently his inner emotions were much worse than some temporary social anxiety."
MrRobot,3dz054,justinbitcoin,-1,Mon Jul 20 23:43:21 2015 UTC,What's to say they can't tamper with the local source either. It's laughable to think they couldn't?

Episode 2 spoilers  He goes through Shayla because her guy (the dude Elliot put in prison) was the only source of high purity  suboxone, the drug he was also taking with morphine in order to prevent its withdrawal symptoms. Hence why he can't go through darknet as it is both much rarer than morphine (evidence: the guy says he's the only dealer of it in town) and there is little to no guarantee of purity. Also going through a doctor to legally acquire it from a pharmacy is both too slow and creates suspicion -  a doctor would want to ween Elliot off of the drug, but both his intake and non-decreasing demand would both raise questions; he mentions this in the show too. If you don't believe me, go and watch episode 2, it happens around the 34min mark  This question was raised by other 'watchers' in the bitcoin thread and I didn't reply there because I assumed their love of l'coin can't be swayed.

Or did I? Both? Neither? Then he's in bed and thinks he's alone. Mr. Robot walks out from the shadows, and he's not ""alone"" anymore. So maybe Mr. Robot is the physical manifestation of his psychological ""you"".  I don't know."

MrRobot,3e021d,throwmeawaypls44,5,Tue Jul 21 00:25:59 2015 UTC,"I mentioned this in a previous thread and it's not evidence by any means but raised some speculation for me.  In the script of the pilot, during the ferry ride, Mr. Robot climbs the side of the cart and suspends himself while holding on to dear life to show Elliot his pain. The operator at the bottom notices this and asks him what he's doing. To which Mr. Robot replies fuck you, the sudden exchange of words draws in more people as they watch in an eerie anticipation of what will unfold.  I gathered 3 bits of assumptions from this.  1) and the most likely is that it meant nothing and wasn't suited for the show thus it was removed.  2) it revealed too much making the whole is he real isn't he real dilemma more unambiguous, something that is what I believe the cornerstone of the show. (After all it IS titled Mr. Robot)  3) had they used this scene, another explanation would have been that it was Elliot who hallucinated Mr Robot doing it, instead it was actually Elliot subconsciously defending him from the truth (he wouldn't take it well if he found himself about to commit suicide or close to it, or that he is hallucinating an entire personality that he plays).  All of this is speculation, but I personally believe Mr Robot is real."
MrRobot,3e021d,LingeringAbyss,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:02:46 2015 UTC,"I agree, I believe Mr. Robot is real as well. I think it is blatantly made to seem like he might be a hallucination, but that could just be misdirection.  I'm pretty sure all of the characters are real. If you map which characters have interacted with other characters, if any of them (except Mr. Robot) are imaginary, then it seems to me that they all have to be imaginary.  I'm stuck on the distinction between a hallucination and a delusion. In first episode we learn that Elliot has suffered ""delusions"", at least in the past. The most obvious of these is the one he explicitly allows himself where any reference to E corp is switched to EvilCorp.  The fact that the audience sees these references as well means that we will share any other delusions that Elliot experiences. I don't think Elliot sees imaginary people or things, but that he interprets the meanings and intentions differently, either willfully as in the EvilCorp translation, or unintentionally as some manifestation of mental illness or drug influence. After all, he is required to see the therapist for reasons that we have yet to completely understand."
MrRobot,3e021d,HotLemonade,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:22:21 2015 UTC,"Agreed, one thing that caught my attention in the show (my memory is foggy of the event now since I never brought it up in discussion) was Mr.Sutherland. We see he is accompanied by 2 men in black, I'm assuming these are the men in black Elliot's been hallucinating but if that's the case why isn't Mr.Sutherland driving the car when escorting Elliot to Evil Corp?  Unless of course those 2 men in black are already confirmed as real then my comment is redundant."

He's a daemon for people around him, though.  Once he becomes a small part of someone's life, he does what he feels is best, regardless of what they want.  Spilling secrets, getting the drug supplier arrested, getting people he barely knows arrested through vigilante hacking.  Sure, maybe it all seems like he's doing the right thing.  But the fact remains that he's influencing other people's lives without their knowledge or permission, running in the background like a daemon."

He promises as a way to placate people, and to him it's just a magic word that makes the whatever he needs to happen, happen. With Gideon it was to alleviate awkwardness stemming from Gideon's anxiety, with Shayla it was to get his drugs. Ironically Shayla even refuses at first on the basis that she promised to never give him morphine without the suboxone and believes ""promises are important"".   I don't think he even realizes that he's not keeping his promises and probably isn't considering (or intending) to hurt anybody. In his mind he's trying to achieve the best outcome. I think it's an important theme to his character, that the tools he uses with the best of intentions to try and ""fix"" things are in fact harmful to others but he doesn't or can't see it."

MrRobot,3dyvg6,pmst,2,Mon Jul 20 20:02:20 2015 UTC,"A lot of this is open to speculation as we don't have a reliable witness in Elliot.  Elliot has clearly had interactions with the other F Society members he can't remember - perhaps he has also had similar interactions with Angela.  Its difficult to determine what she intended by visiting Elliot.  If this had played as ""Elliot, some hackers are blackmailing me into installing this disk - what should I do?"" we would know the situation but instead its just a hole - no knowledge.  I'm curious how this will play out but will be disappointed if she is just a ""dumb blonde"" character.  All the stuff about the Dark Army being able to blackmail her boyfriend was information Elliot already had and they did not need to hack his computer to do so - the hack provides a rationale for Angela to install the disk in case the blackmail fails - his guilt may make him take the fall for Angela if discovered."
MrRobot,3dyvg6,plorraine,3,Mon Jul 20 20:10:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's difficult to tell what she intended: She took the CD and Ollie's badge, told Ollie she was having brunch with her father, and then the very next scene she is at Elliot's apartment looking for him."

But we know she fucked herself over anyway because A) there are probably cameras in there (I mean, c'mon), and B) she probably used her own log-in credentials unless she knows Ollie's, which I doubt she'd have memorized. Maybe he has his password written down somewhere on the desk, but I didn't see her look at it, and I'm not even sure whose cube that was.  Unless Elliot hacks the security logs to cover up for her, she's pretty much screwed."

There's a fakeness to her that I think comes from her trying to be perfect all the time. She's uncomfortable with it as well, but doesn't know how to break out of it. That fakeness goes away for a while at the dinner party though where she's just chatting with Elliot and also for a moment in the scene where she realizes she's handed a stolen wallet back to a thief, but most of the time she (the character Angela), puts on the act. I think she feels like she always has to be the responsible one, especially since her boyfriend is a fucking manchild. It puts a lot of tension on her, and I think she does an excellent job portraying that character, even though I don't personally like the character at this point.  I feel like she's going to get a lot more interesting now that she's ""fallen"".

MrRobot,3dxtgy,molotoviphone,8,Mon Jul 20 16:29:23 2015 UTC,Thank you. Am I allowed to watch the show simply because I like a compelling story that it thoughtful and well acted?

MrRobot,3dxtgy,SynXacK,10,Mon Jul 20 19:59:06 2015 UTC,"Ehhhhhhhh. I'm iffy on this. I can see how it might seem like bait, with the mentally ill late 20s guy with drug issues might seem relatable to many in the Reddit/4chan demographic, but there's enough in there that may or may not put that target demo off as well.   I felt enough like the series has tried to deviate from portraying and drawing that audience enough that I'm very encouraged to keep watching.   And for what it's worth, it's activated me. Perhaps not in the ""blow up authority"" way, but it's fueling my real life research and making me consider new avenues. It's also been the most potent motivator for me to learn code so I can make programs to help my research, since I can't find any that would be useful for me.   But, on the other hand. How many of these intensely paranoid individuals with personality disorders that end up making the news for shooting or blowing people up are 4chan or Reddit users? It's uncanny. Several within the past few years were channers on /k/, which is depressingly no surprise. I think Holmes was well known enough around interbutts circles.  The guy who ran the silk road website was a upper-middle class white guy who studied at Penn State. Same-ish with a bunch of the hacktivists who've been fucking with US .gov websites.   But then, we also have the mass mobilization of people across the world. Protestors in the Middle East and Africa using their social media and darknet access to bring light to the awful shit that goes on out there. Chinese youth use weibo to discuss their government's infringements. Smartphones are some of the most easily accessible tools in MENA, and as a result election fraud in Nigeria is now preserved through social media and Ushahidi.   So that's why I'm kind of iffy. Elliot is definitely the disenfranchised youth, but he's not the Snowden type."

Basically I just got tired of smoking weed half of the week and doing practically nothing but browsing the internet and producing music now and then. It's a matter of knowing when to actually start doing shit before you're out of a job and too late to go back to school. I'm turning 23 in a few months, and I'm finally starting to actually do what I've been planning to do for the last 2-3 years - getting a rhythm going that'll keep me doing my job, and doing fitness on a daily basis.  Weed doesn't kill. It just delays your progress in life, but you get older. At least that's what I experience. It's not as bad for me as it is for others (full-on addiction, not being self-aware), but I'm different anyways. Cynical and unmotivated. Hoping to change that.  tl;dr: Getting sick of the ongoing situation that keeps cycling round and round, putting a plan together, and doing it.  Edit: some clarification."

I don't think he is imagining it. I think mr robot and the men in black are delusions but the rest of the group is real. Everything that happened after the black dude left until he comes back is a delusion,hallucination. That was him detoxing. The rules of only hacking at the fun society are pretty clever. They explain how the silk road operators got busted was via communications through tor. If you only hack from the one building and it was compromised by an ip leak it would be fairly simple to find out if the authorities are on to you. If they take the building and nobody is there you don't lose anything but your location. If there are people inside then you know who got busted and they can't be flipped on you which is how they caught the lizzard squad."

He tells Mr. Robot he can't go in with Elliot unless he's partaking too, and then gets $30 from him so he can enter.  Except Mr. Robot just walks Elliot to the door and then he's gone, which is weird because why would he insist on entering along with Elliot and then not go inside? I mean, he ends up being ""inside"" the house, because he appears on the TV later, but physically he disappears as soon as Elliot gets to the door.  Also: Temperatures in the mid to upper 80s? They need to get the indoor temperature to 95F to destroy the tapes. Is this Elliot's doubts that they'll be able to get it high enough or foreshadowing that the plan will fail?"

MrRobot,3dw2zc,mharray,3,Tue Jul 21 05:26:31 2015 UTC,"Just a warning, Person of Interest starts off as just a really good action procedural show in season 1. Season 2 begins to delve in the world's mythology and then season 3 and 4 are deep social commentaries blended with awesome action and excellently written characters.   Overall, the writing in the show is some of the best currently on TV, topped only by Hannibal in my opinion. The ""villains"" are beautifully painted and provide seriously complex and thought provoking material that'll leave you pondering for days afterwards.  Continuum can feel cheap at times and that's because of the low budget and large use of visual effects. Season 1 is kind of shaky but seasons 2 and 3 are really good (season 3 is my favorite). Similar to Person of Interest, there isn't any clear good and bad guys; both sides have arguments that are completely plausible.   Season 4 of Continuum premieres this Saturday! It's only a six episode season but the over year and a half wait has killed me! Seasons 1 through three are available on Netflix.   Unfortunately, Person of Interest is only available via purchase (I recommend the blurays on Amazon, they're really cheap) or illegal torrent/stream.   Have fun! I'm super jealous you haven't gotten around to these yet and get to experience them for the first time!"

Honestly, my evaulation of Mr.Robot is its more Hollywood hacker than Hackers ever was but this is not a bad thing.

But the point that comes across in the good directing is Starbucks is the corporate american standard for coffee (much like Folgers was for the big blue generation of suites and ties living up the american dream) and normals only drink Starbucks.   Did that make me want to buy Starbucks, not at all so the product placement didn't work. All it did was make me walk away from the screen and brew up a fresh pot of french press from my own private stock of home roasted coffee.  But for the rest of the masses sure I can see how the product placement was intentional in some way."

MrRobot,3dxo52,error9900,2,Mon Jul 20 21:03:08 2015 UTC,I don't think starbucks would pay to have their product associated with boredom and normality.
MrRobot,3dxo52,cyzero,3,Tue Jul 21 01:07:36 2015 UTC,"I can't see them paying for that. Or even liking the idea.  The show is meant to make Elliot look cool, and the moment he becomes unlike himself, thus, uncool, he begins drinking Starbucks."
MrRobot,3dxo52,Sysop_2400,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:21:14 2015 UTC,They might not even be able to use it otherwise.
MrRobot,3dxo52,autokatana,3,Tue Jul 21 04:50:57 2015 UTC,"Definitely product placement. Corporations don't give a shit about a show's philosophy or some tongue-in-cheek joke, they only mind things that actually damage their name. None of that was damaging to the name. The opposite, actually: When you think of Starbucks later, part of your brain is going to be tickled by a scene in this show where you had a good feeling and even though it was a joke at Starbucks' expense, you still associated that good feeling with Starbucks' brand identity. This association will last long after the context fades. That is how product placement works to program you."

It was genuinely unexpected which is what the creator and actor probably wanted to achieve. But, it was probably not product placement. And if the show got paid for it then it was very clever indeed."

MrRobot,3dwi30,Goku_Goes_Crazy,30,Mon Jul 20 02:55:56 2015 UTC,Mr Robot being fake is so obvious that I don't think the show would do this. My opinion is that he's real.
MrRobot,3dwi30,BoomBabyDaggers,6,Mon Jul 20 03:38:11 2015 UTC,"Maybe the reason why he seems so unreal is because even though he is real, Elliot's perception of him is distorted? Maybe Mr. Robot reminds him of his Dad too much?"

MrRobot,3dwi30,twatgoblin,2,Wed Jul 22 02:08:13 2015 UTC,"It seems very unlikely to me.   Though it also seems unlikely that they wouldn't know that their target demographic would go online and discuss this theory ad nauseum, ultimately giving it away to all viewers. They couldn't get that much technically right without understanding this basic reality.   Knowing that they know that we know makes me think they will do the double reverse and make him real. Maybe we are just seeing him as unreal because Elliot at some point believes this. It just seems like a lot of work to do to have a regular old real character at the end.  Keeping in mind that they couldn't know that all their viewers would get the Tyler Durden thing, Mr R being real wouldn't be a twist to them, unless they set it up that Elliot comes to this conclusion at some point. Then they show us all the ways he has been shown to be unreal... Then while he believes this we start to see ways he is real...   I'm overthinking this aren't I?"
MrRobot,3dwi30,crybannanna,2,Mon Jul 20 05:21:25 2015 UTC,"Definitely not over thinking this, as a matter of fact. They have probably just read your post.  I wonder how many laughs they get from some of this subs theories.  Still love reading them all tho"
MrRobot,3dwi30,Imrigo,2,Mon Jul 20 07:10:10 2015 UTC,"I just read the script for the pilot, there were a lot of nuances and changes made. One thing I noted was that during the ferry ride Mr. Robot steps on the edge of the cage and is suspending himself while he grabs a hold of the cage to not fall.  In this scene the operator asks him what he is doing, and Mr Robot responds with ""Fuck you!"" which frustrates the operator. Eventually causing him to cut the ride short. The crowd gathers and watches him. It's interesting because, we aren't even aware if their is an operator during the ferry ride in the show.  Two things I gathered from this we're, 1) Mr Robot isn't real and Elliot was actually the one about to jump off. (A big assumption but based on the direction the show is taking with the hints)  and 2) This made the whole is he real or isn't he too conspicuous that it was removed from the show to add to the suspense. (Indirectly adding some support to the Mr. Robot is real brigade but no good in terms of evidence, just hopes)  EDIT: 3) It literally meant nothing."

As far as I remember, we haven't seen a picture of his dad yet.  Granted, most of the dissociative identity disorder comes from the way that Darlene seems to be more familiar with Elliot than she should be, but I like the idea. He ticks a lot of boxes for the disorder. Although missing time is harder to prove."

So, he is being shadowed and traced, but more likely by Tyrell either in a private or business capacity.  As in, either Wellick is actually privately employing dudes to follow Elliot, or he's requested some of the security or intelligence branch in E Corp NY to monitor Elliot.  Which I think is so super interesting, as it is very realistic. I've taken a number of intelligence and security classes, and one of the major revelations about monitoring technology is that it's still not as reliable as just sending some dudes out to get some HUMINT,"

Do you think Tyrell might be involved in creating the FSociety or at least anonymously putting the idea in their mind that they can bring down E Corp and make a big change in the world?  If he did that, he must know that they really can't do anything to harm E Corp, and if they try, he knows Elliot and can therefore bring them down.  The reason he'd try to put the idea in their minds in the first place is to get rid of the former CTO so that Tyrell could take his place."

When he takes them away he is taking Elliot's safety net as a way of keeping Elliot in line. I think he means it's stupid to be scared of withdrawal when he could be fearing for his life if he gets between Vera and Sheila. I'm going off memory of the scene so I could be wrong.

Plus it shows the room they're in, which is the room you walk into from the front door. Here's the inside, and the outside. Look at the curtain.   That actually disproves my weird camera cut theory. If you consider the distance, there's no way they walked through a basement room and to a staircase.  Edit: I fucked up. It has to be a weird camera cut. They walk into a doorway that faces the right side out the house (looking from the front lawn). Then they come out of the staircase facing the back of the house (Elliot turns twice to face the front of the house). Still weird that they came in through the basement since the room he ends up in is the front room."

MrRobot,3dt6b6,sharkbait359,10,Sun Jul 19 05:26:54 2015 UTC,My guess - Rami is the one on the left?
MrRobot,3dt6b6,wredj10,19,Sun Jul 19 07:27:02 2015 UTC,Are they even identical? They look different to me.
MrRobot,3dt6b6,Xaguta,15,Sun Jul 19 08:11:21 2015 UTC,Sami is slightly fatter. That's where the difference comes from.

MrRobot,3dt6b6,Xaguta,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:12:04 2015 UTC,If he weren't standing next to Rami I wouldn't call him fat by any means. But he is undeniably fatter.
MrRobot,3dt6b6,sharkbait359,12,Mon Jul 20 13:53:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I get what you're saying. The one on the right seems to have a wider face and lower eyebrows/larger forehead. To me, the 'thinner' one seems more like the Rami we see on the show."
MrRobot,3dt6b6,KennyFulgencio,5,Sun Jul 19 09:02:17 2015 UTC,In a dark alley at night they'll look identical
MrRobot,3dt6b6,molotoviphone,-14,Sun Jul 19 10:03:15 2015 UTC,"Can't tell if this is sarcasm. Rami is on the right, I believe"
MrRobot,3dt6b6,pehp,3,Sun Jul 19 07:42:46 2015 UTC,"Rami has a longer, sharper face. The one on the right is the more round of the two."

MrRobot,3dv2rt,buzzkills68,2,Sun Jul 19 19:29:57 2015 UTC,Hadn't thought of him looking like his father yet.  I kinda like that idea.  Im feeling a slow pan across a family photo in episode 10...
MrRobot,3dv2rt,Sysop_2400,0,Sun Jul 19 19:36:55 2015 UTC,Oh man. Ep 10 that long? I blame GRR Martin.
MrRobot,3dv2rt,Sysop_2400,2,Sun Jul 19 19:40:41 2015 UTC,"Only my guess.  I get the idea they'll save that one, and then season 2 the enemy will be the dark army.  Just my $0.02"
MrRobot,3dv2rt,crybannanna,2,Sun Jul 19 19:42:05 2015 UTC,Feel like the dark army has already become the enemy. I think they a re going to be a problem in the next few episodes.
MrRobot,3dv2rt,Sysop_2400,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:08:57 2015 UTC,It is a bit early to be introducing the next big enemy...
MrRobot,3dv2rt,crybannanna,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:16:52 2015 UTC,"I think it could serve as an interesting diversion away from the main story. A roadblock on the way to their goal.   Clearly the dark army is working another angle, and I can't imagine Angela won't reach out to Elliott when he is done with his withdrawal hallucinations. Seems like if she does, he will have another conflict like the drug dealer thing.   Does he selfishly do nothing, or take on an enemy and suffer the consequences. In this case it's going through withdrawal to protect Shayla, the next one will be risking his plan to protect Angela.   If Elliot finds a way to foil their plan on the road to his own, season 2 could have them seeking revenge. It just seems like they need to address it soon. What are their plans, and how do they effect the plans of fsociety?  I don't see how their plans wouldn't interfere with Elliot's, and need to be dealt with."
MrRobot,3dv2rt,Sysop_2400,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:00:17 2015 UTC,I kinda like that revenge idea.  The entire dark army vs. Elliot.  Sort of a throwback to Hackers.  Cue Voodoo People.
MrRobot,3dv2rt,Sysop_2400,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:49:34 2015 UTC,I hope so bc this character drama arc thing is working against everything they worked for in the pilot. It's a cybercrime suspense. Keep it that way.
MrRobot,3dv2rt,crybannanna,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:11:14 2015 UTC,Dark army vs Elliot vs Fsociety vs Sam Esmail. So meta.

MrRobot,3dv2rt,jpatton89,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:42:48 2015 UTC,Had the same theory. I can already see the family photo being revealed with young boy Elliot smiling next to his Christian Slater father.   I sort of hope they go a different route though. It's sort of cliche to do this type of thing. Though I'll be satisfied that I figured r out beforehand.
MrRobot,3dv2rt,i_bite_right,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:10:47 2015 UTC,It will be kind of a let down if they went that route. We need more conspiracies.
