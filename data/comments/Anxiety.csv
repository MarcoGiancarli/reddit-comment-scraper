Anxiety,3e3c8v,nrf92,3,Tue Jul 21 17:14:58 2015 UTC,I feel the same way. It's comfortable to know others are going through the same. Even more comfortable to see the many people who are starting to get better and others who are much better. There's hope for all of us.   Can't help you with second half of post. Curious myself. No one but my wife knows about this. I find it hard to even talk to her. I feel no one gets it unless they go through it. But I'm sure it's not like that.
Anxiety,3e3c8v,elpapaITguy,2,Tue Jul 21 17:57:41 2015 UTC,"Welcome!  I feel you on that.  When I first experienced anxiety, at 12 years old, I could not feel more alone.  My parents gave me tylonel whenever I had a panic attack!  I have learned a lot and received great input and resources from people here about coping with anxiety. It is consoling when I have questions, thinking I am crazy, to find that people relate to what I am going through and have made it out ok.  Talking about it and being open and honest has helped me so much."
Anxiety,3e3c8v,mvicsmith,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:40:04 2015 UTC,"I told my mother about going to the dr and getting diagnosed with GAD and depression, and that they gave me antidepressants, etc. She didn't understand and doesn't seem to want to talk to me anymore. She told me that I let people ""label"" me.   So... I really don't tell many others about my struggles with them. My bf knows, but he has chronic depression himself so he understands. Everyone else, I just tell them that I'm ""sick"" if I need to take a day to myself due to anxiety or if they ask me why I don't look so well.   But I'm glad you found this place! :D"
Anxiety,3e3c8v,sigyn13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:13:42 2015 UTC,"Welcome to /r/anxiety! I have found this to be a wonderful place to share our experiences with each other. I think we can all learn something from another person here. These people help me see my issues from a different perspective and many have been in the same place.  I tend to wear my illness on my sleeve. I try to be very upfront with people about my anxiety because there is such a stigma but it really is getting better. I like to think that I'm doing my little part to show that anxiety really is a disease (condition/illness/what have you) and the people who suffer are your friends, family, co-workers, and neighbors.   Anyway, welcome again!"
Anxiety,3e3c8v,Resickandtired,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:36:27 2015 UTC,"Welcome! I always wish I discovered this sub sooner... It's difficult when you don't know anyone who can relate.   BUT the more you talk about it the more you'll actually find that other people will open up and share their issues as well! Before I realized what I had was anxiety, I would say ""I overthink and over-analyze EVERYTHING"" which I feel like most people can relate to at least a little at some point. It helps to also just explain your basic symptoms, or use metaphors (for me, my racing thoughts are like bees in a tornado).   In a problem-situation, I try to remember DEARMAN so that the message gets across clearly."
Anxiety,3e0j9c,Dean_Winchester36,106,Tue Jul 21 00:49:57 2015 UTC,"I might not always cry, but I always get the burning in my eyes and my throat tightening up. I have yelling and loud voices and try my best to avoid them because of this same problem. I can relate 100%."
Anxiety,3e0j9c,LinenPotato,19,Tue Jul 21 01:11:55 2015 UTC,"Same here, I might cry afterwards lol, but I hate that I'm so easily hurt by someone yelling at me"
Anxiety,3e0j9c,LizjaimeS,6,Tue Jul 21 10:15:00 2015 UTC,This is so true. Many times after a yelling I'll start to well up and have to tell myself to relax and get over it.
Anxiety,3e0j9c,mschu5,4,Tue Jul 21 12:30:14 2015 UTC,I have a pretty short fuse but when someone is yellig and there is an intense situation I start getting a knot in my chest and my throat. I know I can handle the situation but it's like everything just boils up at once.
Anxiety,3e0j9c,PicklePicker3000,7,Tue Jul 21 16:47:57 2015 UTC,"Yup, same. The worst part is that it doesn't even have to be someone yelling at me, it can just be hearing raised voices or any tone of aggression."

Anxiety,3e0j9c,QotNuite,2,Tue Jul 21 01:52:17 2015 UTC,"I'm the same way. If someone seems annoyed at me, I might start crying as well. Either way, I'm just upset haha. I'm starting to.. Grow out of it, in a way though."

Anxiety,3e0j9c,boo_urns82,18,Tue Jul 21 01:45:13 2015 UTC,This is s brilliant idea. I always PANIC when my boss asks to see me. Shaking and horrible stomach ache and I can't breathe. I'm 25 for gods sake.

He knows I freak out about that stuff, and he's really good about not thinking I'm some weirdo. Which is nice."
Anxiety,3e0j9c,kittyjam,18,Tue Jul 21 17:41:03 2015 UTC,"Yes! I always think back to when my boss yelled at me for the first (and so far only) time. It was about 2.5 years ago, I was 20, and I work in an office. I messed up but was new so I didn't even realize I had messed up that badly, and as soon as he started yelling I just started bawling. I think it was a mixture of being a perfectionist who hates messing up and my extreme social anxiety that I just couldn't handle it. My boss ended up apologizing for being so angry but he was definitely taken aback by my reaction. He asked if no one has ever gotten mad at me before, I guess he just doesn't understand. And it makes it worse that once I start I can't really stop, so for the rest of the day I was teary and could never quite catch my breath. Luckily I haven't messed up again and hopefully when it happens I'll be able to handle it a little better."
Anxiety,3e0j9c,Mickyala,2,Tue Jul 21 02:57:10 2015 UTC,"I react to stress and people being rude by putting up an angry defense mechanism.   I remember a few years ago my boss took me into his office for a review and told me that I act like parts of the job are beneath me. It blindsided me. I didn't feel that way at all but it's how I apparently came across when trying to deal with everything. I was so upset about that - both the negative criticism and knowing that's how people saw me.    I remember being so upset and trying to fight back tears in his office, which is also bad because there aren't a lot of women in my industry and those of us who are working aren't taken as seriously, it's very ""old boys club"". So crying in the boss' office ain't such a good look....   It's been about 4 or 5 years and like 7 different jobs since, but that is etched into my brain."
Anxiety,3e0j9c,papershoes,2,Tue Jul 21 17:35:12 2015 UTC,What fucked up boss thinks its' professional to yell at a person even if they do screw up?
Anxiety,3e0j9c,majeric,2,Tue Jul 21 18:33:18 2015 UTC,Ugh I know how that feels. Same thing happened to me when I was 21 at a job I had. I was an absolute mess and had to leave early. I was so embarrassed and so mad at myself for acting that way but I couldn't help it
Anxiety,3e0j9c,taytermuffin,18,Tue Jul 21 14:49:15 2015 UTC,"Omg yes! Anyone older or an authority figure, any raised voice or snarky tone and I start tearing up and usually can't stop it, and zero chance of having the ability to speak up if it's completely unprovoked/uncalled for.   Thanks for making this, I really wish I could have read all these when I was a child so I didn't feel like such a freak/crybaby (my mom was the yeller, my dad had the piss-poor tone).   The worst thing to yell: STOP CRYING IT'S JUST YELLING  The worst thing to say in a snarky tone: oh COME ON I'm not even yelling...   These will guarantee another half hour of uncontrollable crying and feeling like complete shit.   edit: mostly formatting"
Anxiety,3e0j9c,microbitch,4,Tue Jul 21 04:16:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the authority figure is exactly it. If a peer is being angry I have no problem telling them to calm down, but one of my worst memories is my band director taking me to his office to tell me not to do something again.   It makes me sound like a goody-two-shoes but I'm not really. I just hate disappointing superiors I guess?"
Anxiety,3e0j9c,SexualCannibalism,2,Tue Jul 21 11:13:27 2015 UTC,"Yup I usually couldn't care less about my peers... Unless it happens to be someone I have respect for, then it hurts pretty bad. Or if a popular person publicised their opinions of me, then I'd feel misunderstood by EVERYONE and that'll get to me.   But most of the time it's just authority figures... Something about people with any pull assuming the worst in me and being disappointed by a misunderstanding... And the only way I manage to express myself is bawling =(  It has gotten better over time, though... But boy was childhood rough."
Anxiety,3e0j9c,microbitch,2,Tue Jul 21 22:03:32 2015 UTC,"I am the same way. I hate taking things so personally. But even when someone may say something in a snarky attitude, I take it internally and I usually cry about it later."

I've had bosses raise their voice at me and professors and I get teary eyed every time.  I really don't think there's ever a situation as an adult (or even teenager) where I feel it's necessary to yell. It's disrespectful and isn't a good way to communicate. If someone were to yell at me now id probably ask them politely to lower their voice. Hahah"
Anxiety,3e0j9c,Mandymandy10,12,Tue Jul 21 01:24:46 2015 UTC,I don't even have to be yelled at sometimes. People have to just show disappointment and verbalize it to me. My Nstepmom liked to tear me down and my edad would sit there looking so disappointed in me and it crushed me growing up. I later found out its because he knew I was right about her abuse and he just sat there and let it happen.
Anxiety,3e0j9c,agirlnamedtex,11,Tue Jul 21 03:21:26 2015 UTC,"Yes. I used to cry, despite trying very hard to resist, whenever a teacher raised their voice at me in high school, the fact that other students had a tendency to laugh did not much help things."

""I'm just going to let you know that if you ever get mad at me/yell at me I will probably cry my eyes out and scare you. It's normal."" It has worked in my advantage though because none of my managers ever yell at me at my new job. Lol. They just calmly explain what I've done wrong and I fix it or don't ever do it again (WHICH IS WHAT PEOPLE SHOULD DO ANYWAY). Win-win."

Ill get this physical manifestation of guilt, too, wear I can feel it in my forearms and stomach..  Interestingly, I only have this reaction to people I know, like my SO or a friend. If it's a stranger or a rude customer I get angry and  yell back, ha."

Anxiety,3e0j9c,beautifulfuckineyes,7,Tue Jul 21 04:35:09 2015 UTC,"Wow. I never once realized that crying when getting yelled at would be tied to my anxiety. Talk about a mind blowing realization. I get so frustrated any time a manager has ""scolded"" me, when I'm in some sort of ""trouble"" or when teachers used to yell at me etc... and then just cry about it. I always thought to myself ""why the fuck am I crying about this..."" but there I am crying. My dad, like a lot of other users have said, yelled at me a lot too.   holy shit, OP. Thank you for posting this. I really never made the connection. I just usually feel childish about it because I can't stop until ""I'm done"".

Anxiety,3e0j9c,dreadredemption,6,Tue Jul 21 04:13:42 2015 UTC,"Ugh, all the time. I hate it. No matter how focused I am or how many deep breaths I take, I still well up and turn red. Avoiding eye contact and just focusing on the issue at hand (like an exam page) can help, but only for so long. Even if I'm not involved and there's yelling around, I can get anxious and tear up. I avoid these situations if I can, because it's embarrassing as hell."
Anxiety,3e0j9c,crackerjackerbandit,5,Tue Jul 21 04:53:16 2015 UTC,"I get super sleepy, thanks to my mom being very loud, dramatic, and angry growing up. For example, she used to clutch at me, stare deeply into my eyes while crying, and wail for a fucking hour, yelling if I got frustrated with her or didn't want to listen anymore. I was a little kid. I didn't know how to deal with adult emotions. It's like a learned response, I think. I just shut down and things get drowsy, and I need to be alone and go to bed. Although, this only happens with my mom or people who yell like my mom, which is fairly rare. My family still mocks me for not being to handle them. ""Oh, haha, nbreg can't handle a lot of information coming at her."" Not in yelling form, I reply. ""We are yelling because we're worried and upset."" Ugh.  Generally, in terms of average yelling (nobody ever reaches my mom's level of shrill, dramatic, annoying, and suicide-inducing), I stay pretty calm, and mock the other person for being ""emotional"" for yelling. I know it's unfair of me, and a lot of people yell, but I never do, and people who escalate their voices to make a point annoy the shit out of me. It just seems like poor emotion regulation. And they are displacing their emotional burdens onto me. So fucking rude and unproductive."

Which I should probably already do, but this put it into a nice context for me!"
Anxiety,3e0j9c,papershoes,5,Tue Jul 21 17:41:54 2015 UTC,Yeah. My mom screamed at us a lot as kids and shit got really bad so I would run to my room and hide and just sob.

Anxiety,3e0j9c,Malted_Shark,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:17:14 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I didn't have an abusive household, per se, but what you said makes a lot of sense.   My mom had really severe depression during my formative years and would freak out about the smallest things. I had to walk on eggshells for literally years around her, and always make sure she was happy/comfortable/okay before all else.   She's way better now and not at all as reactive as she was, but I bet that's why I can't handle any sort of negativity, loud voices, or people being upset around me. It makes me feel like retreating into myself because I'm not good enough to make things ok and that I need to do better."

Once, I had just had enough of a supervisor hounding me about something and in a moment of poor self-control talked back to her. She got unbelievably pissed and started berating me right there on the sales floor (this was a big box retail store, customers everywhere) and I just started crying uncontrollably and could not stop. It was so mortifying, I finally begged another supervisor who was there that day to send me home because I could not stop crying. I turned in my two weeks notice the next day. That was probably the worst one. Thankfully now I work from home, so if that sort of thing were to happen at least nobody would know.  It makes me so mad when I react that way because I feel like a big baby but I just cannot control it."

My dad is a really loud speaker in general, and likes to raise his voice and swear, and my mom and I give each other frustrated looks all of the time until she tells him to be quiet.

I've put that down to control, though. Because I have complete control over my voice and I know no matter how loud it gets I'm safe and okay. If someone else raises their voice then my anxiety immediately cripples me and I cry."

The pain doesn't make me cry, but I'm extremely jumpy and the shock of being startled that hard sometimes does.  My mom is very loud, and when she gets mad she always ""raises her voice"" (aka: shouts but refuses to acknowledge it) so that doesn't help."

One of the most humiliating moments of my childhood was when I cried because a teacher gave me a detention for being late when it wasn't even my fault (homeroom teacher held us late). I just ran off into the bathroom I was so humiliated. Thankfully she was very nice and understanding and came after me to calm me down and let me explain. But the entire class saw me burst into tears, ugh.  Nowadays I try to hold it back and I am good if it is like a customer or whoever who is mad, but if my parents or boss are mad at me, forget it. At my performance evaluation my boss had nothing but good things to say to me but I STILL cried from the anxiety of it.  I also get really anxious when people yell at other things. Like my fiance will yell at the computer, football, etc and it makes me want to throw up. I was never verbally abused or anything as a kid so I have no idea why it happens but I have to leave the room."

If you're in the US, you can go to psychologytoday.com's therapist finder and see if you can Skype with a therapist. After you search by your zip code or city, look at the left sidebar and you can adjust your search by what insurance is taken, and to see which therapists use Skype. Using Skype is becoming increasingly common for people who are agoraphobic.   Is it possible for someone to take you to a general physician or psychiatrist? General physicians are usually cheaper and can still prescribe medication for mental health. It might be a good idea to get some blood work done to rule out any causes like thyroid issues.

Thanks for the link, I think it will be helpful to talk to someone without actually leaving the house, though I expect myself to get the courage one day.    I am afraid to take medication, because of past experiences with SSRIs and anti-psychotics. I might be willing to try a SNRI to see what happens.

I went through exactly the same thing when I turned 23 and I'm here to tell you that COMPLETE recovery is totally possible. Better, you can come out of it stronger than you were before IF you decide to view this as an opportunity, rather than a curse.   You sound like a smart guy, headed for great things. Great things mean controversy, and you've been gifted a perfect training ground for learning how to push through controversy and defy the largest obstacle you'll ever meet; yourself.   Please don't off yourself. You're important to me now. Instead, get a copy of Tony Robbins ""Unlimited Power"", read it religiously, highlight, scratch notes, and APPLY the shit out of it.   It took me two years to stumble backwards into what exactly was causing my anxiety, and get a handle on it. The information in that book, if applied, will change your life in days, if not minutes.  However, there are two guiding principles I would say anyone struggling with anxiety needs to focus on:  1) Framing: How are you viewing your situation, and what are you telling yourself about it?  2) Nutrition: This is UNDOUBTEDLY the largest source of anxiety and it's fucking criminal the way corporations and governments ignore its importance. If you do nothing else, begin to educate yourself in real, whole-food nutrition and you will absolutely see a change, I guarantee it."
Anxiety,3e39up,tfimg24,3,Tue Jul 21 21:34:02 2015 UTC,"Anxiety truly takes a toll on the body. Like you, I had stomach issues. I didn't know it was anxiety at first. I went to my GP a million times, saw two different Gastroenterologists, saw other specialists, took a natural route, and so on. I was even in the hospital for a bit because I couldn't walk 50 feet without wanting to puke.  I had a CAT Scan, an Endoscopy and a myriad of other tests done - all came out A-OK.  So anxiety can do that to you. As for my other symptoms, I do have the fatigue, lack of drive, head pressure, chest tightness, chest pressure, chest pain, stomach pains... a lot of physical stuff.  For the stomach, probiotics and Glutamine seemed to help me. Talk to your GP about it before taking anything, of course. They are both good for the gut.  You're only 21. I'm 27. I'm an old man, and I started having to deal with this years ago. #IT DOES GET BETTER#. Seek therapy and the aid of a Psychiatrist as well. I'm on Prozac and Wellbutrin, and Klonopin as needed.  Wait, I see you have one already. Well, it those meds don't work, try new ones. Everyone has a different body chemistry,  so maybe Prozac would work better for you. Remember, it takes a fee weeks to kick in, and the initial start up side effects may suck as well. Xanax really helped me a lot during the start up.  It helped curb ny nausea that I had.  Also, exercise helps a lot. I also take ZMA at night, try to meditate, drink tea, get laid, whatever.   As for not drinking alcohol. It sucks. I know. I couldn't drink on my 25th birthday. It's a social norm and it sucks, especially for 21. But man, it is NOT worth it. It can be potentially dangerous to drink on meds. I have and it was stupid to do so. Never drink on benzos like Klonopin or Xanax. SSRI drugs like Prozac? Not a great idea but tolerable in my experience. The day after, or even days after, my anxiety is sky high. When I was on a bigger dose of my meds and drank and I felt like death the next day. I literally laid in bed and slept all day and felt shitty for days. Now? I still feel shitty. I actually just dropped drinking again due to new meds, but it is what it is.  Stay strong."
Anxiety,3e39up,PoppaDR3W,2,Tue Jul 21 18:11:59 2015 UTC,"I am taking some 30 billion pills of probiotics and they have helped calm my stomach. I have never heard of Glutamine, but I will check it out.   My GP is not really helpful. Each time I go in, they just check my blood and my vitals and send me home as normal. It is frustrating, but I am at a loss as to what I have to say to them for them to not treat me as just another anxious kid.   You're not old, my sister is older than you haha. I get the point though. I keep telling myself that it'll get better. I tried Zoloft, but it made me suicidal. Now Fluvox has had some what of a positive effect on me. I think that it would be best to stick with it. I have weened down on my Klonopin does as it is addictive and I noticed myself becoming more addicted to the pill. I am on one a day so that I can potentially drop it all together. Should I continue to take it to lower my anxiety and up my confidence? I think that sounds like a smart move, but I don't know.  I walk at least 4 miles a day, if not much more. I use to drink tea, but I drank so much I would make myself sick. What a fickle bitch tea can be :).   Overall, I really appreciate this viewpoint. It is nice to see someone of a similar situation making progress. I guess I just won't drink, but that is the way the world works. Everything in moderation isn't a bad thing. I just have to do what I have to do. I am looking at a Dr who is supposed to be world-renown for this type of OCD/Anxiety I have, and I think I am just going to shoot for the moon.

Or do you mean you feel stressed?  The cause of the stress is the key.  Only you can figure that out.  I will take a wild wild guess.  You are trapped between wanting to please your ambitious parents, and on the other hand follow your own path.  This could easily tear you part, and then if your studies are in fact too much for you to handle, you imploded. I.e. reaching for the stars you were told you were entitled to expect is what's causing your heart to break. And you work a job too?? It's unforgiving.  There is a good chance you can resolve the symptoms, but you must align your lifestyle, and ambition trajectory, to the limitations and needs of your mind."
Anxiety,3e4gbw,sheeplikepeep,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:50:49 2015 UTC,"It certainly is a ridiculously difficult and stressful time for everyone- my roommate just graduated and is experiencing a similar dilemma.  The people you talked to are right though, I think. You will get through it and you will be okay.  There's no way of externally controlling the situation, it's about finding the calmness and control in your mind. Work from the inside out.  The paradox of choice is that too many options make you feel like it's impossible to pick the best. The great part is is there isn't ONE answer- there are lots. Whatever direction you go in, you won't mess up. Even a crappy job can lead to another opportunity, just as much as a fun job could.  You'll do so many things the rest of your life, you don't have to commit to something forever in this moment. Just kind of head somewhere that feels right and a whole new plethora of options will emerge.  Do good things for yourself now- worrying about the future and ""what ifs"" just make you miserable and forget about the present.  Big breaths. Focus on you, not on other people. You say you need a full time position, so that's today's step. Do today's step and the tomorrow will be brighter, don't worry.  Good luck!"

A really strong night terror (I get them at least 4 times a year) or a very vivid nightmare will put me off wanting to or going to sleep or feeling 'safe' during my waking hours for days. It's frustrating as I know it's all in my head but it feels so real. :( It's really exhausting when it happens but since I have pretty chronic nightmares, I've given up on ever being free of it. I've just learnt to deal with it the best I can over the years."

My doctor once told me that after a panic attack it's easier to have another one because your body is more on alert or something like that, and I feel like it's the same thing with the dreams.

But now, if possible, I will launch into yoga.  If I am not in the best environment for that, then I do deep belly breathing (sometimes it takes 5 breaths, sometimes 30, but if I am consistent and persistent, I become calm).  Once my physical body is calm, my heart slows, I can feel my limbs again, then I notice my negative thoughts evaporate. I would also recommend doing a physical task of some sort that takes mental focus (for me it might be vacuuming and reorganizing a closet). You are definitely not alone!  Nightmares set me off too...

I feel like I can relate to your situation, except that I'm a 22 year old female. My anxiety usually tells me that people look at me, and they're thinking negatively about me, so my strategy for coping with it is if I ever make eye contact with anyone, just smile.  (Whether or not it does,) it makes me feel like the other person will then think I am nice and more likely to think positive things instead of negative things. (I think this affects women more though because I know if we aren't smiling 24/7 we look like a total bitch.)   It also makes it easier for me to just carry on with my day and not think about it after the fact. Because if they want to think negatively about me or talk about me, that says more about them than it does about me.  Hope that helps. :)"

You gotta admit that even when you walk down the street, you look at other people unconsciously for maybe even a split second. It's what humans do. It's natural. But I think you take each and every glance as a signal that they're noticing something bad about you when they might have just casually glanced over the second you decided to look at them."

Anxiety,3e38mc,symphony64,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:09:45 2015 UTC,"Well there can be many reasons. I have people stare at me all the time as a male and for a long time I thought it was just me being paranoid until my friends confirmed it. When I am with a girl people will look and judge if we are a couple or not and then make further judgement. If I am alone it's cause I look ""different""(i look half black half asian) and attractive from what people say. People could be looking at you cause you look different, attractive, or look familiar. Some people also just have faces people stare at or trust easily. It's one of the things I learned to accept as something I cannot control but people look at me because I am attractive and look different. It doesn't really cause me any problems cause their judgement usually isn't mean or rude if it's me by myself. If I am with other people is when the judgement changes. What bothers you about it? Is it you feel unattractive, like people are judging you, something is wrong with you? A lot of anxiety comes from worrying about people's judgement and opinions anyways but from my experience people who stare usually don't think anything wrong of you."

I am a 25yo woman however but I feel like I notice more people when I'm feeling especially anxious or having a hard time. It makes me feel incredibly self conscious and aware of all the things I hate about my body. However when I realize I have these thoughts I try to remember that people are people and staring is a totally normal thing to do. Sometimes it's because you're attractive, sometimes people just stare off into space, or sometimes you look like someone they know or something you're wearing reminds them of something or whatever.  Honestly, because sometimes for me the stares become unwelcome comments or incredibly unsettling, just try to ignore everyone and focus on your own shit. You can't control other people, you can only control how you react to them."
Anxiety,3e38mc,small_tits404,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:34:05 2015 UTC,"Hi!   I totally relate to this! I hate it when people say's it's in your head too. : ( I'm a 22 year old girl but anxiety is the same pretty much across the board, I think!  For me, I feel it happens more when I am already anxious. If I have bad thoughts in my head the stares just pile onto everything and make the anxiety absolutely unmanageable. Most of my anxiety happens in public too, when I'm in an unfamiliar space.  Like ygfann said, we as people all look at each other all the time. I think maybe when I look anxious or upset people can sense that energy, even from far away! They read that nervousness and respond in judgment/ rudeness/ fear. People tend to match other people's energy, you might be making some face or have some kind of body language that you don't even realize which they are responding to in a negative way.   That's why I think nrf92 has really good advice, smiling even when I feel horrible can help reset my mood and the way I interact with others. There's TONS of studies out there, that smiling helps you be happier even if it's completely forced! It's super contagious. It might be helpful just to look at yourself in a mirror when this happens (as soon as you can get to a mirror) and force it! Someone gave me this advice and it seemed so crazy at first but it's really magical. It's helped my anxiety with this exact thing dramatically.  Hopefully I tagged people properly, this is like my second comment ever. I really feel for what you are experiencing, I hope this feels better soon. : ("

If you ever find the answer, let me know- but until then, just know that you aren't alone. Your husband probably thinks you are the most wonderful person in the world, and your kids too.  Even when you are stretched to your limit and feel like you've become someone else... That fun, adventurous, kind, caring person is still you. Your personality didn't up and walk away. It's just blocked by a crap ton of stress. Just try to focus on the things that are still good in life, only worry about the problems you can fix, and try to take good care of yourself. Sometimes that means taking a break. But, if you do go on a hike, away from the commuters and painfully inept grocery store clerks, promise that you'll allow yourself to relax.

Mine stems from the fact that I am allergic to one particular medicine, and that I'm super sensitive to most other medications.   My question is how soon after taking the pill did you have your panic attack? If it was within five minutes or so I would say it's definitely just a panic attack. If it was 30 minutes to an hour afterwards then I would be concerned. I have taken two SSRIs and both said that if you have increased anxiety, suicidal thoughts etc. to contact your doctor. I would advise doing so.  I got over my fear of medication in terms of SSRIs just because I know it will make me feel better. I also tell a close person to me that I'm starting a new medicine and ask them to keep an eye on me in case an adverse reaction happens."

Anxiety,3e4rzl,Guenhwyvere,2,Tue Jul 21 23:47:59 2015 UTC,"I have food-related anxiety from having spent a large portion of my life with undiagnosed celiac disease. I'm very, very accustomed to feeling pain and sickness immediately after eating, and now suffer panic attacks that manifest with symptoms mimicking food poisoning at the slightest sign of abdominal distress.  The thing with taking new drugs an psych meds is that, more often than not, they WILL cause side effects. Sometimes the side effects go away after you've been on your full dose a few days/weeks. Sometimes they just reduce. If they don't reduce at all and you simply can't deal with it, you need to talk to your doctor about other treatments and meds.  I highly recommend that you try a drug for anxiety RESCUE, like xanax. A lot of people take xanax daily for GAD, but I have a prescription for it that's meant to rescue me from panic attacks - nothing more. It works great for me.  What your medication is designed to do is help your brain balance out its chemicals and hormones. It's not a poison so much as it is a blanket meant to muffle your raw, oversensitive neurons and stop them from shrieking and melting down when you've been triggered. It's not trying to poison you. It's trying to nurture you and provide you with a chemical means of resting and calming down.  Remember: actual poison doesn't calm down after you've shaked, hyperventilated, and collapsed for a few hours. It doesn't just ""give up"" after it feels it's sufficiently swung you around like a sock puppet. Panic attacks do. Panic attacks can also manifest subtly and insidiously by making you feel sicker than you might normally be while adjusting to new medication. Don't listen to it. Remind yourself over and over again that your disorder is lying to you and forcing you to see your symptoms through a fisheye lens. It WILL get better, you WILL be okay, and you're NOT going to die. Commit the side effect warning on the side of your pill bottle to memory. Read it over and over to yourself like a prayer to remind yourself that any dizziness, nausea, or lethargy is normal. You are NOT being poisoned, and your panic disorder can kiss your ass for trying to deceive you into thinking you are.   What can be an awesome tool, also, is to keep coming back to this subreddit. Read peoples' posts, especially about medication, and maybe even contribute with replies/posts of your own if you feel you can. One of my coping mechanisms and tools to stop my panic attacks are to come here, talk to other people that have the same disorder I do, talk through my panics, and regard them as the list of symptoms and causes that they are.  You're going to be okay. Don't forget that."

And throw up. Because my panic attacks make me fire out both ends like I've got E. Coli for 4 hours. It's pretty shitty. Literally.  It's frustrating. It's emotional as hell. And it's unpleasant as sitting on your own balls on a hot metal park bench. I've never met or spoken with anyone who's come out of a panic attack feeling the same as before they had it. Hell, after my 4-hour-long pukefests subside, I'm so exhausted that 9 times outta 10 I fall asleep on my bathroom floor because I'm too tired and drained to make the 30ft walk back to bed.  I'm so used to it by now that I no longer feel afraid when I panic. It seems like an oxymoron - not being panicked when you are, in fact, panicking - but it does happen. The physical symptoms can be a result of enormous amounts of stress hormones in your body running amok. However, the frustration of it is maddening. It feels like, ""How much bullshit is this that I'm not even concerned? I'm literally sitting here watching cooking shows while puking my brains out because of a panic attack I'm not even afraid of.""  But the thing is, a panic disorder is just that. A disorder. You have to remind yourself that what you're experiencing is simply the result of a brain that isn't good at managing and regulating stress, either because of a wonky adrenal system, or because of some awful stuff from your past. It's not your fault, and it takes an enormous amount of time and effort to learn your way out of them. Tons of people never do and, while not exactly encouraging, it means that you're not alone. There's nothing horrifyingly wrong going on that's presenting itself as panic attacks. It's just your brain deciding to flip tables.  It's so easy to feel depressed and hopeless, like you said, but you have to learn to forgive yourself. Think of it like a chronic autoimmune disorder: There are medications, diets, and therapies you can go through, but a flareup is just a flareup. It's not your fault, and it WILL go away. Forgive yourself as the patient rather than punishing yourself as the disorder. You are not the disorder. An imbalanced brain is."

Anxiety,3e4e7w,onecooktwocooksthree,2,Tue Jul 21 21:35:38 2015 UTC,since last week I've been drinking pretty heavily since I'm not on any meds at all.   Would you ever start and stop a drug the doctor prescribed you?  You have to be just as diligent with how you feel and understanding yourself when you self medicate.   For the current uncontrolled thoughts - have you ever had an instance where you were able to control your thoughts?  Do you understand its possible?   Its not acceptance - you have to work really really hard to control yourself.   Consider your bad thought or physical symptom as a habit.  It just pops in.  How do you change the habit.  How can you generate positive thoughts from the things around you instead of negative?

Anxiety,3e2m5m,auggis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:28:24 2015 UTC,"The song ""Lives"" by Modest Mouse has two good lines I like to repeat myself. The first one being ""my hell comes from inside myself"" and ""it's hard to remember we're alive for the first time, it's hard to remember we're alive for the last time."" I rephrased those from the original lyrics but they give me the kick in my ass I need to help fend of anxiety.  As someone who is heavily influenced by science, Carl Sagan's quote ""we are a way for the cosmos to know itself"" is extremely humbling for me. I also like ""the most astounding fact"" by Neil deGrasse Tyson. It's on YouTube, it's too long for a mantra but after watching it I feel much calmer."

Even though you don't have insurance, there are still some options.  1) Can you see a general physician? A GP is generally cheaper than seeing a psychiatrist, but can still prescribe medication for mental health. Google the name of your town/ a nearby one + sliding scale general physicians.   2) Google the name of your town/a nearby one + free clinic or free mental health clinic. Hopefully, there's something available. If you're in the US, you can use psychologytoday.com's treatment facility finder.  3) You could use psychologytoday.com's psychiatrist finder if you're in the US. Click on a psychiatrist;s profile and scroll down to the finances section. If it says sliding scale: yes, then you're in luck because the price you pay can be negotiated.  4) If you need a therapist for more support, you can go to psychologytoday.com's therapist finder and search by your zip code or city. Click on a therapist's profile and scroll down to the finances section. Look to see if it says sliding scale: yes. Therapy and medical care charged on a sliding scale is the quality as regular-priced care.  Let me know if you need anymore help."

Anxiety,3e453p,rick-the-hamster,2,Tue Jul 21 20:31:20 2015 UTC,"this is a helpful guide.  It doesn't mention pressure changes. I wold suggest taking a packet of hard sweets to suck at take off and landing to help your ears equalise to the change in pressure.   you will only need to check in when you take off, not when you leave. There is normally a big sign telling you what airline the desk is for and they will generally announce it over the tannoy.  Check the website of your airline for the dimensions of a carry-on bag and for a list of what is or isn't allowed. you can normally take only one, so if you carry a handbag (not sure if f or m) make sure you have room to stuff it in the top of the carry-on bag. I would suggest taking a spare shirt and underwear in your carry-on as well as an empty water bottle as you will be able to fill it once you have gone through check in.  To make you stuff easier to identify get a length of really lurid ribbon or paracord and wrap it round the handles so it really stands out.  edit to add - unlike in Home Alone it is really hard to get on the wrong flight - at least 2 people will check your ticket, at the check in desk and at the plane."
Anxiety,3e453p,manyshaped,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:44:59 2015 UTC,Good advice! I personally chew gum during takeoff/landing but hard candy would work too.  I haven't flown in a year but every time I did you could take a carry on item like a small suitcase or backpack AND a handbag like a purse or laptop bag. I don't know if that has changed though.  And to add there are lots of signs to find your plane and there are assigned seats on the plane. It will all be very easy to figure out once you are there. Also once you land you can get your luggage and leave. You don't have to check in with anyone.

I struggle with this, but the breathing helps. Try to ask yourself ""what happens if?"" I find most often the answer is ""nothing"" or ""it happens"".   Realizing that worrying about it will not affect the outcome helps in a huge way."

I am prescribed Ativan as needed and at a very low dose and it works for me, but it took me several months to find an antidepressant that worked for me as well. The human body is unique and sometimes it may take a while to just find what works for you and in the right combination with other meds as /u/dwade333miami mentioned. Ativan just may not be the right benzo for you. Before I was prescribed anything and when my Dad was in the ICU/hospice there were a few times I needed some relief because his girlfriend was driving us all up the wall in a situation that was already tense and difficult to handle anyway, and my sister-in-law had me try one of her Xanax a couple of times. Even at a low dose I just wasn't a fan of how it made me feel - very foggy and almost like I was tipsy. The Ativan works great for me though, so talk to your doctor and don't give up the fight to find something else!"

You can try grapefruit juice as well.  With that said, id just throw the benzodiazepines away and never look back, you either make the choice to be on them for the rest of your life or don't take them at all"

Whether that is the case for you; no-one here can answer that with any certainty. That said, what you describe here doesn't immediately make me think ""DISORDER!"". Why do you want to know?

Anxiety,3e1umf,kdg0dfkgdsfgdfg,2,Tue Jul 21 08:46:58 2015 UTC,"I was in a similar situation, but my parents (unknowing to me) refused to medicate me. After talking with a therapist for months for anxiety she realized that I showed many ADHD symptoms so I got tested. Couldn't believe that my parents did this to me.  Anyways, I've had crippling social anxiety and my therapist told me untreated ADHD usually results in anxiety, social problems or depression because of coping techniques your brain does to protect itself. My doctor was reluctant to try a stimulant since I also suffer from panic attacks but the stimulants calm me right down. My social anxiety is heavily reduced and I've cut my benzo intake in half.  I originally tried Zoloft and Lexapro before my ADHD diagnosis since my doctor thought it was simply anxiety but neither of them worked for me. If they had worked, my anxiety would have been lowered but it wouldn't be treating the underlying condition. The reason I was so anxious was because my thoughts were rapidly firing without the ability to analyze them so CBT was also usless at the time.  In my opinion I would try the ADHD meds again since it is most likely the root cause. I tried Vyvanse but it made me tired, Concerta but it made me depressed and now I'm on Adderall XR which has been working somewhat but I'm still in the titration process. If you can't handle the stimulants there are now non-stimulant options to try.  To this day I can't believe amphetamines calm me down so much.  Good luck!"

Anxiety,3e1umf,noginator,2,Tue Jul 21 14:37:44 2015 UTC,"No problem. The thing with ADHD is that it you don't outgrow it, it is a legitimate chemical imbalance that has to do with physical parts of the brain and it can't be cured, only managed. It usually ends up geting hidden by other ailments or an individual will find that behavioral modifications are enough to cope. Unfortunately for some, you can't change your thinking if there's no time for you to analyze your thoughts. Medication is by far the best treatment.  I tried all the ""natural"" treatments but nothing even came close to the results of actual ADHD medications.  I believe my parents thought ADHD was the result of poor parenting since all the disruptive kids had it but I had the inattentive type so it was less obvious and this was during the 'Ritalin boom' and they believed it was a scam."

I too have a supportive SO that I've been with since about that time. I had very little friends while in highschool and after graduating. My self esteem was horribly low. When I was 19 I got on medication, felt elated nearly all of the time but quit after a few months because I felt it had stopped working.  It was only until this past year that I've made great strides in easing my struggle. I learned about mindfulness and other Buddhist concepts (r/buddhism is great.) I got on another SSRI about three months ago. I try to take care of my body as far as eating goes. Exercise is also beneficial, as well as positive self talk.   As for friends, when I moved with my boyfriend I started hanging out with his friends more, who were anywhere from 2-6 years older than I. This helped in terms of finding friends. And this year, for the first time since my freshman year of highschool I finally found a best friend who I have so much in common with. I talk freely to new people and don't feel as isolated as I once did. I tell you this so that you know there is hope out there.

Try not to engage with people solely because of the goal of engaging with people, but because you want to share your ideas and feelings. This can only be done when you yourself are secure and not doubting the quality of what you are saying.

I hadn't been drinking but I did spray this thing called ""rescue remedy"" on my tongue which does smell a little like brandy I guess.

However, that was the mentality of my mom through all this.  She thought I was just getting drugs to be high, because she works in the medical field.  Even the professionals apply the stigma.  Of course,  it's all because we suffer from something intangible.  I'd say anxiety can be just as painful as a serious infection, but it goes unmedicated because we live in a society that simply does not value mental health.  It doesn't value much mentally or spiritually, which leads us not only to refuse to acknowledge mental illness, but refuse to treat it, and to show a lack of compassion from those suffering.  Which is evident in the homeless people you'll meet.  Many are seriously ill, and there's no compassion towards them.  We refuse to diagnose the sick, treat the sick, and take care of the sick when it comes to mental illness.  Sorry for the rant, I just hate that even doctors can't help a person in need because they assume all of us with a disorder are crazy or drug fiends."
Anxiety,3dy6k9,polyfionicspree,4,Tue Jul 21 00:17:59 2015 UTC,"My experience is similar to yours though in my case I didn't take medication because I'm from a 3rd world country.  Doctors there either didn't understand about anxiety disorders or didn't care.  By the time I learned about anxiety, I already had various ways to cope.  Fast forward to 2 years ago I was going through my worst period of anxiety in 2 decades.  I went to my doctor and he prescribed Xanax .25 mg to be taken as needed.  I was very reluctant to take it at first and when I did it was only when I couldn't handle the anxiety anymore.  I eventually ended up taking .25 a day for about a month.  I would take it around 5 in the afternoon.  This would get me calm enough by the time I got home from work so I could spend time with my daughter.   Effect lasted till bedtime so I got in 5-6 hours of good sleep before the anxiety hit again.  Being able to sleep well for me was the greatest benefit.  Anxiety is such a vicious cycle.  Your mind is so agitated it can't rest causing more anxiety in a continuous downward spiral.  Getting adequate rest helped break up that cycle.  One day the anxiety just lessened and I was able to wean myself off in 2 weeks.  My preference is still to avoid medication if I can.  However knowing that it is available certainly helps me cope."
Anxiety,3dy6k9,hollidaychh,2,Mon Jul 20 18:53:48 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you went for so long without help.  Unfortunately, there is a general attitude that anxiety isn't a disease, but I feel it is just as much one as depression.  I am so glad yours has lessened now."
Anxiety,3dy6k9,Atroxa,3,Mon Jul 20 18:58:05 2015 UTC,"I have problems with chronic fatigue. Based on your experience, do you think Xanax could cause someone to be more tired at a low dose?"
Anxiety,3dy6k9,heyitsanne,5,Mon Jul 20 19:48:28 2015 UTC,"I've had chronic fatigue and intermittent fibromyalgia for years. Mine is mostly psychosomatic (I know based on my mental health history and extensive medical testing).   I think some kind of medication, even something like Xanax, might actually alleviate some of your fatigue rather than worsen it. The stress of anxiety is as much physical as it is mental. If medication can reduce your stress, it may reduce your fatigue."
Anxiety,3dy6k9,heyitsanne,2,Mon Jul 20 21:00:00 2015 UTC,"While it didn't do it for me, I am positive it still could.  Drowsiness is a listed side-effect.  Our bodies are prone to sleepiness when we're calm, and anxiety can be exhausting, so it would make sense to feel sleepy.  However, I think at a low-dose you wouldn't instantly fall asleep.  I took 0.5 mg but .25 mg is available as well.    I will say when I was younger, I took a higher dose (didn't have a disorder at the time).  A friend of mine had killed himself, and I took 2 mg from someone at school because I was a little hysterical.  I actually did fall asleep - in middle of writing, sitting up, at my desk.  You could actually see my sentence go right off the page as I fell asleep.   I don't even remember most of the day.  Definitely not to be toyed with if you have things to do."
Anxiety,3dy6k9,AnxiousPete,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:57:02 2015 UTC,I've had friends that Xanax makes them tired. The 0.25 dose definitely doesn't make me tired though.

Anxiety,3dy6k9,lizzievicarious,2,Mon Jul 20 22:24:51 2015 UTC,It's the worst part of my anxiety because I've grown to fear heat so much since - mid-summer too.  I plan on making a trip to Burning Man which will pretty much conclude whether I'm getting better since it's extremely hot.  I just can't keep sacrificing my life for anxiety.
Anxiety,3dy6k9,anxietyaccount97,2,Tue Jul 21 00:22:14 2015 UTC,"I hate the heat too. I think in part because when you get an attack, sometimes your body temperature rises and you get seriously bad hot flashes. Be careful at Burning Man."
Anxiety,3dy6k9,SethR0gen,2,Tue Jul 21 04:26:44 2015 UTC,"I think I get the hot flashes, but honestly in an attack I don't trust my body - I don't trust that I'm cold even if I have goosebumps, or that I'm hydrated if I drink a gallon of water.  I feel prepared for Burning Man so long as I'm careful and address this particular trigger for the month leading to it.  I've been doing much better with heat in particular.  Breathing, which is sometimes related to heat and humidity, still remains a concerning trigger for me.  I get very insecure about whether I'm getting enough air, and I feel afraid that I'll stop if I don't keep reminding myself.  I think so long as I have my medication on hand and plenty of water, I could come away from the experience feeling healed."

Also, you will be too hot during the day and too cold at night - just be prepared and listen to your body. I am excited for your playa adventure!

I mean this in the most respectful way possible because I'm in therapy myself, but have you considered seeing a therapist at school? A good one can help you move forward by challenging your anxiety. I learned how to socialize much better thanks to therapy too. I was very frustrated and now I'm doing better! If you do decide to consider seeing a therapist, then google the name of your school + therapy to see what comes up.  Also, if you're struggling with not having energy, perhaps it's a good idea to get some blood work done to rule out any causes like thyroid issues. You can probably just go to a general physician on campus and have him or her order the tests."
Anxiety,3dy83k,dwade333miami,4,Mon Jul 20 14:54:15 2015 UTC,"Smile  if you feel you're coming across to blunt and if you're stuck for things to say then ask people things...even if you already know the answer. How was your weekend? I like your bag/whatever where did you get it from. Did you know/see xyz on Facebook/internet/news the other day? Don't put yourself down about thinking you're boring. You can fix this, the key is in your thoughts and how to manage them. When you identify negative thoughts replace them.  ""I can't go buy food I'm too tired""  ""Fresh air and a brief walk will be good for me and I'll tick getting food off my list of things to do meaning I'm productive today""  Just like that. It will become easier the more you practice :) and you'll feel your mood and energy lift."

If not, why not, why not create one and put up flyers around campus? Most campuses have rooms you can reserve for this purpose. There was even a ""Do nothing club"" where a group of friends literally did nothing. They had an agenda, a president and weekly meetings. It takes a lot of courage to branch out of your comfort zone. Shit, I remember freshman year being so anxious I made it to the door of a social club meeting and walked right by straight back to my dorm. A year later I went to the same group after I made some friends in class. College will be some of your best years of your life. I really wish I did more non school related things and made more friends. Put yourself out there and see where it takes you. If you don't like it, you can always go back to what you were doing. Definitely nothing wrong with that either way."
Anxiety,3dy83k,rosietheribbiter,3,Mon Jul 20 20:04:02 2015 UTC,"I hated my teenage years with a passion. Everyone was so egotistical and moronic - the constant conversations about boobs and penisses - the constant dreadful showmanship that people put into themselves to appear greater than they were.   I could not connect with people my age, because my focus was on deeper mental issues and troubles that people my age was incapable - literally incapable of deciphering.   My solution which somewhat worked was to pinpoint people who was capable of expressing deeper thought and interesting conversation and seek them out with discussion. These kinds of people were able to see me for who I was, and oftentimes did not lie about who they were to the extend that they were aware of. This helped me a lot in college.  People with higher IQ and generally higher degrees of maturity was the kind of person that I was able to connect with, perhaps the same is true for you...? Regardless do not be afraid to appear stupid. We all had to go through this due to lack of self esteem as a teenager. The more you try, the less stupid you appear, and the more capable of connecting on a deeper level you will become.   Simply put, have faith in your abilities to connect with people, and know that others too have the same issues as you, however they simply know how to mask it better than you.  Be shameless in trying to optain that which you desire - connection! that way, you will fail, many times, but eventually you will learn to go beyond your lower self esteem and mental blocks and by then, you will have truly found yourself!  Have faith!"

I feel like somehow I'm doing college wrong. I completely resonate with you. Not everyone is like this but it doesn't make you boring or broken.   One thing that's helped me get out of the house is to trap myself into a commitment with my flatmates. I make plans with them and feel obligated to go when the time comes, even when I'm feeling anxious or depressed. So far it's been good and I've been getting out more, still not as much as the average student probably does, but it's an improvement. Baby steps. :)"

It's what gets viewers attention and gets them watching.  It's really all overblown and made to come across as ""this is something that will affect your life!!"" When really they just need attention getting headlines. It's sort of like those celebrity gossip magazines you see at checkout with crazy headlines that make you pick it up while in line. I would stay away from watching/reading the news.

Anxiety,3e161x,ButchMFJones,3,Tue Jul 21 04:01:44 2015 UTC,"This is one of my biggest struggles. Know that you aren't alone though. You're young and capable. Try to be proud of yourself for living a life that allows you so many options. Remember to trust yourself and know that there are no bad options. Worst case scenario: you make a mistake. If that happens, trust you'll land on your feet and get back to the drawing board. There is a great quote in Sylvia Plath's, ""The Bell Jar"" that hits the nail on the head about this feeling. It's actually pretty interesting given she wrote this sometime in the 1950s.  “I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.”"

Anxiety,3dybrt,mikerowaev,13,Mon Jul 20 15:09:25 2015 UTC,"That's a hard one. It might have helped to say something, but it also may have freaked the person out because you would be bringing attention to the anxiety. I'm not sure how I would react myself, but if it was a stranger coming up to me during a panic attack I guess it would depend how they approached me and what they said. I wouldn't obsess, actually I would, but shouldn't at this point. If you encounter this person in the future it might help to explain that you saw him last time and what it looked like was happening. Then, explain that you can relate to it and offer some advice. Looking back at when I was in high school, when anxiety hit me hard, it would have been nice to have someone tell me I was not losing my mind and that they understood what was going on. It took several years before I got help for it or even knew what the hell was going on. It was a lonely and terrible time."

Months later I found out she was having a horrible panic attack, and me talking to her about my socks brought her back to reality.  I had no clue.  It kind of showed me that sometimes while people are having anxiety, they just need a reality check.  Maybe if you notice someone having that happen, you could simply engage them in some way.  I am sure some people would respond well to actually just asking if they are okay, or simply relating by making a comment ""I do this breathing exercise too and I really like it"" and do it a long with them?  Just an idea :)"
Anxiety,3dybrt,jenniferjuniper,6,Mon Jul 20 17:44:11 2015 UTC,"i think it's very hard to know what the right thing to do is for someone. everyone reacts differently to different experiences. if you had helped, it may have made that person more at ease and less alone. or, it may have launched them deeper into panic because they dont want the world to just look at them and know theyre anxious. don't feel too guilty or stress about what you could have done. the fact that you are consciously struggling with this shows your morality and compassion. there is no easy solution to any problem!"
Anxiety,3dybrt,divaslam,4,Mon Jul 20 17:12:46 2015 UTC,I would have approached them and lowered myself to their eye level and just said breath in to my counting and breathe out and then look to them for confirmation then start counting and make sure they were breathing slow.

For me, what I would like most and therefore what I would want to try for someone else would be an oblique approach--give them something small, like a candy bar or something, with a smile. Small things like having someone open a door for me with a smile or offer me the chance to buy the last pack of cookies we were both looking for have really made my day when I've had a hard time.

Friends often put their hands on my shoulders and back to help ease my tension and they helped greatly.

Helping someone get to the next stop is the least thing I can do for someone who is suffering in such a public place when they are probably fearing for their safety.
Anxiety,3e12vl,Setsunaela,2,Tue Jul 21 03:32:19 2015 UTC,"Is there a reason you haven't gotten insurance/Medicaid?  I know this may sound like the least helpful thing in the world, but it sounds like you really need access to therapy and medication management.  A lot of the obsessive, negative thoughts you're having can probably be helped with cognitive behavioral therapy or some other technique available through self-help books. However, I think it'd be a lot more beneficial to actually work with a therapist who can help you get to the root of the problem, which is an interpersonal issue.   A therapist/psychologist is someone you talk to, someone who helps you figure yourself and your situation out through dialogue. A psychiatrist is someone who manages your medication, can prescribe and alter the type or dosage of whatever you're on.  Being on the Paroxetine (Paxil) but having no way of trying out a better medication or getting yourself off the med safely (which it sounds like isn't possible without medical supervision) doesn't sound like a good situation to me.  If there's any way for you to get insured, there will be many mental health resources available to you."

Is it possible to go back to your clinic and explain the Paxil isn't working for you?   Anyway, to see a therapist, you can go to psychologytoday.com's therapist finder and search by your zip code or city. Click on a therapist's profile and scroll down to the finances section. If it says sliding scale: yes, then you're in luck because the price you pay can be negotiated. Therapy charged on a sliding scale is much cheaper than regular-priced therapy."

Feeling like your time is running out or you're fatally doomed is a common feature of depression, anxiety, and other mental/physical illness.   I was in college, but I had to drop out because of physical and mental health problems. I also can't drive and haven't worked for a long time.   I know what if feels like to be young but feel old.   I also know what it feels like to hate yourself for all the things you're not doing or haven't accomplished, while simultaneously feeling like it was and is impossible for you to do those things.   In my personal experience, EMDR and Brainspotting have helped me the most, not just with my trauma and mental illness, but particularly with my physical symptoms.

Something that helped me is having a really good support system, my husband specifically. I still think people hate me and I kind of got to the point where I said ""who the f cares if they hate me? Someone still loves me."" It usually doesn't bother me but I honestly don't have many friends. I cut out people that trigger my rage, including my sister and for very good reasons. No social media for me...well aside from reddir lol. For some reason facebook made me miserable. It was a huge reason for my anxiety. Everyone is trying to prove tbat their life is great and ended up making me feel like i was inadequate. Facebook is a joke...doing that made a huge difference in my life. I also started eating better too. Eating food to fuel my body and not mask the pain has forced me to find ways to cope. I cope by sitting in the sun, doing yoga, and cycling. There are days when I just want to sleep and be miserable...so I get myself a big cup of coffee, make sure to take my PRN, and I somehow get through it. I feel better than I did one or 2 years ago. Taking steps to protect my future such as finishing school and eating healthier have helped. These are really simple and probably obvious ideas, but I really hope I spark some ideas and you can figure things out too. If you ever need to talk to someone, then let me know. I was diagnosed when I was 20 and I'm 23. Never followed through with the dbt therapy but still go occasionally to talk to my therapist. She has never pressured me into treatment so make sure that nobody tries making you do anything if you don't want to."
Anxiety,3e06rt,seekerofpeace,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:08:39 2015 UTC,I am sorry you are struggling.  I don't have any advice (sorry) other than find the best therapist you can.  If your current plan isn't helping don't give up finding someone who can get your treatment right.   I sure hope things turn around for you soon- just don't give up.  Hopefully someone on here will have better advice for you - I just wanted you to know you are heard.
Anxiety,3e06rt,Davlau,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:08:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks, thats really nice of you. I am still lucky to have the things I do. I just know things shouldn't be this hard. I have no objections to seeing a good therapist, but I think I need to find a better primary doctor. Mine is a joke. I just wish I could show the new doctor what I have written here, because it would probably give them more insight into treatment. I would just feel weird doing it."
Anxiety,3e06rt,Davlau,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:17:23 2015 UTC,"That is an excellent idea.  You really want a doctor that you are comfortable with and able to say anything to.  If what you have written is more clear than what you can verbalize on the spot, I would bring it and share it.  The more the doctor understands you,  the better he/she can help you.  I agree things shouldn't be so hard and I am glad you are so open to help.  I wasted too much time thinking it was ok to suffer and after I finally got the help I needed, life is so much better and peaceful and joyful.  I hope you find the same thing."
Anxiety,3e06rt,Porkintyme,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:35:57 2015 UTC,"Mate been where you have been and am still going through it to a certain extent, but without the associated disorders (no offence). What helps me is to stop comparing myself to others and their expectations for me. After all what do they know about what makes you happy. You need to get a job that doesn't stress you out and make you miserable. Find a job that does that and that you enjoy, so that job to the best of your ability and be satisfied. Stop being harsh on yourself about failure and the possibility of it. I bet the people that care about you don't even care if you are good looking or how smart you are, they just want you to live and be content. I practice self acceptance more now after years of beating myself up like what you are displaying. It is really life changing when you start BEING yourself and stop trying to fool or impress others."
Anxiety,3e159a,Wintersoulstice,2,Tue Jul 21 03:54:16 2015 UTC,"Everyone needs therapy. Literally everyone!  It's like working out or going to the doctor when you're sick... It's an all around heathy thing for any person to pursue.  How it gained such a weird stigma of being a sign of weakness is a total mess of complete ignorance- well that and lots of people being paired with a therapist they're incompatible with. It sounds like you are having anxiety attacks and deserve to nip them in the behind before you  actually do getting those ""OH MY GOD IM DYING"" attacks.  It's okay and fairly common that you're experiencing this stuff and there are ways to overcoming it by blowing yourself away with inner strength and shiny warming process.  Consider interviewing a few therapists and measure your strength around how open you are to resolving this in truly proactive ways- not how well you can bottle it up and suck it up in your mind.  Sorry for such a wad of advice... I honestly can't tell you how deeply I empathize with exactly what you're experiencing.I found my way out of it after a good deal of psychological hard work and humility. In other words - lots anxiety books and videos along with biweekly therapy for about 6 months, give or take. I felt the same way as you did at a time and therapy was my saving grace. Now I view having a therapy session like something as nice as getting a massage or watching a subset on the beach... Its just so incredibly calming and important. Hope some of this helps a bit and I will be hoping you feel much better soon"
Anxiety,3e159a,hoursaid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:13:05 2015 UTC,"I think that it is best to break down the situation at hand and approach it like modules.   You have just graduated from university and you want to get a real job - I am assuming it is something related to your degree, has long-term prospects, pays more, something you can be proud of talking about.  Many people have this anxiety.  In fact, even people who have graduated from Masters, PhD, etc have this anxiety.  This is normal.   It means that you care about where you are headed.  How are you going to get there?  You should list down a list of doable things that you can do to get to where you want to be.  Rewrite your CV.  Sign up to short courses online (focus on one or two).  Is there a certification that you can do?  Education doesn't stop after university.  There are conferences, workshops, certificates, courses.  Sign up to a relevant course (even if it's free) and add to your CV.  It shows to your employer that you are committed to professional (rather than academic) development. You have moved to a new town across the country.  Not only that you have moved with your SO and both of you are used to being in bigger cities.  Being anxious in a new situation is normal.  I have done the same time, and I was anxious for months to the point that I barely talked to anyone about it, not even to my friends. DON'T DO THIS.  I was so conscious of my situation, I was ashamed to tell my friends about it.  If your friends stopped talking to you because of the move, are they even your real friends? With the above new life changing moves happen over a short space of time then you start being anxious about yourself as a person overall.  These sorts of things can seep in.  I think communication is key.  I've gone through the first two, but not in this so I can't help so much unfortunately :(   Anyway I have gone through something very similar to you.  I would lie in bed, even until 12 noon or 1pm, I would literally feel like I was in my own nightmare of my own doing.  I was in a living nightmare situation.  And then, I realize, that I am in a five bedroom house, I am with my parents, I am in a safe and developed country, and so on... I started listing out the things that I am grateful for.  I am grateful that I have my physical health, that I haven't completely and utterly lost my mind, that I am still functional, that I have loved ones with me.  Remember to list your gratitudes!  Good luck!"
Anxiety,3e1p62,CooperArt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:31:18 2015 UTC,The vivid dreams and fighting/chasing dreams is something that i deal with a lot. I dont sleepwalk but I do talk in my sleep sometimes but from what people have told me its nothing significant but its also cause when I'm with other people I sleep safely without being chased/fighting. I thought my dreams were because of me also being bipolar. I have become numb to those dreams and can force myself to wake up from them when it gets too much for me to deal with. When I wakeup I then see something terrifying in my room like grim reaper or slender man that seems incredibly real.
Anxiety,3e1p62,auggis,2,Tue Jul 21 11:12:16 2015 UTC,"Well, that sounds like a known phenomenon. People who wake up suddenly often find they can't move, and that their bedrooms have become a living nightmare.  I think it might have happened to me once, because I recall a sudden shift in sleeping habits as a kid where I stopped sleeping on the floor (for some reason didn't want the bed) but don't recall why.   My talking, if you prompt me, can be significant. I can hold a conversation. It's usually to turn down food I'd accept if I were awake. But otherwise, it's just nonsense.   I was told, the one time I slept with my ex... I made it clear to him that sharing a bed with me wasn't nice. My sleep self was grumpy and unpredictable. He said she snored, talked a little bit, and rolled over a few times. It was as mild as it could get, and he never complained she got any worse on him."

Anxiety,3e038i,Mandymandy10,2,Tue Jul 21 01:31:39 2015 UTC,"I don't have any experience with Zoloft, but I've had run-ins sleep paralysis since I was 9. It's not unusual to hear or see scary and strange things when it occurs, in fact it happens more often than not from my experience. The Zoloft might cause or increase the risk of further SP episodes but you'd have to ask your doctor about that (You should probably bring this up with your doctor either way). Otherwise, not sleeping on your back, keeping your hands off your body (Don't rest them on your belly/chest) and maintaining a regular sleep schedule usually helps in decreasing the risk of reoccuring episodes."

I took a sales job a few years ago because the money was too good to turn down. It was waaay out of my comfort zone but I looked at it like holding my nose and jumping into a pool of cold water. It was hard at first - took a lot of psyching myself up pre sales calls - but eventually got easier when I stopped acting how I thought I was supposed to act and more like myself. If you be yourself and try to personally connect with others they are way more likely to trust you and buy from you. I had the sales gig for almost 3 years. I was happy when I moved on but I must say it did wonders for my social anxiety, made me more assertive, and gave me more confidence. Try not to get discouraged and keep at it.

It might be a good idea to schedule an appointment with a general physician to get some blood work done. This can rule out any causes like thyroid issues.   If you're in the US, you can go to psychologytoday.com's therapist finder and search by your zip code or city."
Anxiety,3e0u87,dwade333miami,2,Tue Jul 21 02:34:06 2015 UTC,I believe I was tested for Thyroid a few years ago when I saw a therapist. Only went a few times. I went to a class to find out what classes to take that will help me. I got assigned one but never went. Partially cause of my wife's school schedule at the time and partly because anxiety wouldn't let me.   After this though I will be contacting my doctor to get something going. I've had enough of this controlling my life. It hurts me but I think it will hurt my children's most of all. They are 4&6 and I want to do everything with them.

With that in mind, I would recommend you start seeing a therapist to help manage your symptoms. A lot of the symptoms you describe and compare to others is your own way of your body coping. You say that your symptoms aren't as severe as other people but we cannot know what others truly feel without being in their body. Most sufferers of anxiety know the ""pending doom"" feeling that comes with anxiety but some people have very different reactions to the anxiety their mind creates.  In my personal experience, I find that anxiety symptoms differ based on your coping mechanisms in general. What I mean by this is there is a direct correlation to how you feel with anxiety and how well you have learned to cope with stress in your life.  The reason that a therapist or counselor can help you is to understand how to cope with what life throws at you. Your body has no clue on how to handle things so it gives you all of these symptoms to say ""Help me! Something is wrong!"". Don't be ashamed for it, just know that you are improving yourself and growing as a person when you take the time to do this."

Its just some days I feel really bad, and in that moment I really feel like I need help. Others aren't so bad and it doesn't feel like I really need any help."
Anxiety,3e0s8r,ndg2006,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:14:32 2015 UTC,That's the downside of our minds... they are so expansive and ever changing that it's hard to commit to changing it. It's a lot easier to feel better after having a rough day and being optimistic that you are all better but in reality we have to cope that our brains are wired a bit differently.  Sometimes outside help is the best thing we can have to help our minds through this.
Anxiety,3e0p13,pzone,2,Tue Jul 21 01:37:17 2015 UTC,"Sorry you are having such a rough time. I can relate to what you are talking about but I don't have the exact same experience as you do. That being said, I know how hard it is when you get super stressed. My brain loves to sit there and create this overwhelming scenario in my head that's too big to tackle. It makes me want to hide and wait until it goes away. The problem with that is I can't...  You have a strong battle going on inside of you with this problem. Some might say that baby steps is what you need to get out this bad area but with your final paragraph, I have to ask: have you talked to a counselor or tried medication for your anxiety?"
Anxiety,3e0p13,ndg2006,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:43:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the reply.  I've had years of meds, therapy, everything. I ran out of meds a few months ago since I'm not allowed on campus (where my previous pdoc's office is) and haven't been able to schedule an appointment with a new one since it's just one more thing on the pile of crap I don't want to do.  Bleh.  I crashed and burned while I was still on medication though so I don't think it's my first priority. I have a good therapist, but if I'm not in one of these bad moods when I see him I can't work through all that much.  (Last time we met I was like ""Yay, going to new york, cancel our next session!"" and two days later collapse.)"

It honestly sounds like you are having a real rough time right now and medication would really give you the push to make some improvements. I don't know what your medication experience is but I can speak from experience that finding the right medication is the difference between feeling how you feel now and being truly happy.

I would say what you are feeling is 100% normal and will go away with time but I also know that it's easier said than done to put these feelings to rest and not have them again.  At this point it would be best for you to come up with some coping mechanisms to help yourself out once the change actually happens.  For starters, you need to remind yourself to not get so caught up in leaving. I know that's easier said than done, but the more you get caught up in it, the easier it is to get swallowed in to the hole of fear of that day coming. The best way I can explain this is sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night thinking it's time to get up. Then I check the clock and see that I have only been asleep a few hours. Score! I get to get some more sleep. Every day until the day you leave is one more day to enjoy with your family."
Anxiety,3e0o0n,faithlis,2,Tue Jul 21 02:35:16 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the advice. I read in a book about coping with anxiety that if you're stressing about something coming up in the future to sit and think about what's scary, and do breathing exercises until you feel relaxed. Then repeat this until thinking about it no longer causes anxiety. I'm going to try that out. Your example with waking up and feeling relief that you have more time to sleep really helped.

Anxiety,3dxwu3,Luhaja,2,Mon Jul 20 15:08:10 2015 UTC,"Yes - a side effect of antidepressants include agitation, which is probably what you're experiencing. how high a dose are you currently taking? consider talking to your doctor about taking a lower dose for a while and see if that helps.  Generally side effects such as agitation should decrease with time as your body becomes accustomed to the drug - so once your body has gotten used to the lower dose of the antidepressant, then you can slowly take a higher dose.  However, some people report still having too many side effects with a certain kind of antidepressant, those people may need to change to a different antidepressant that has a different side effect profile.  Make your girlfriend aware that antidepressants has this effect on people for a while, and that you are sorry and didnt mean to do what you did. Make her aware that you are in a vulnerable period of time and that it will get better once you have stabalized on the drug - or found a more suitable antidepressant.   Good luck!"
Anxiety,3dxwu3,Luhaja,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:28:16 2015 UTC,20mg I believe. I feel agitated and sometimes not social once the drug is in full effect. Yes I'll be slightly happy but I cannot.  I did skip a day of the drug - a day after the breakup hoping that I would come back to normal. I did and now the feelings of sorrow and sadness/loneliness are coming back to me.

Anxiety,3dxwu3,SunflowerInKashmir,3,Mon Jul 20 17:57:50 2015 UTC,"It takes atleast 2 weeks for antidepressants to have efficacy. - 6-8 weeks for antidepressants to reach full efficacy.   During this time - you will just have to hang on tight! I assume this was explained to you when you started the drug up? There are many stories of people taking their own lives when they start taking antidepressants simply because of the increased agitation, together with suicidal ideation. Doctors have oftentimes managed this issue by prescribing a benzodiazepine the first 2 weeks so that the patient doesn't have this problem.  One thing is certain to me - you will need to speak with your doctor about this issue, I'm certain that he/she has some idea of what to do if you cannot deal with it, as I stated before, taking a different antidepressant or simply taking a lower dosage for a while so that your body gets more slowly used to it, are options to consider.   Good luck!  Also side note - please refrain from not taking the drug for a day. Not taking it is very unhealthy for your system, unless ofcourse you wish to completely discontinue the drug."

Sometimes the guilt or questioning that follows a decision I have made is almost as bad as my anxiety itself. I am my own worst critic and love to replay my worst mistakes when I make a new one. It's cringe worthy and fills me with guilt.  That being said, I want to share some advice with you that a counselor once gave to me.  I want you to think about a pen in your hand right now. Now drop that pen on the floor.  I think we can both agree rationally that the pen fell out of your hand and on to the floor. Now, pick that imaginary pen back up and ask yourself the following question: Could you have not dropped the pen?  Let me know your answer and I will finish this neat exercise with you."
Anxiety,3e0rgm,ndg2006,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:02:22 2015 UTC,"It sucks, doesn't it?  I could have not dropped the pen, of course. At least I can imagine a scenario where the pen didn't fall out of my hand"
Anxiety,3e0rgm,ndg2006,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:04:31 2015 UTC,"Here's the other side of the exercise: it all depends on your definition of could!  In a literal sense, no, you couldn't have not dropped the pen. The pen already dropped! You cannot reasonably go back in time to drop the pen. Now, could you theoretically go back and not drop the pen? Sure, anything is possible (once wormholes are discovered I guess).  The reason I bring this exercise is quite simple. I know that guilt feeling you have. I know what it's like to have it keep replaying in your head to remind yourself just how worthless you are for what you did. What you need to do though is imagine the joke as the pen. You cannot go back and change it. You have apologized for it and now you need to tell yourself that the pen dropped (or you joke actually happened). Take it as a learning experience going forward. You don't have to make the same jokes again, you also don't have to run in to that same person online again. What you can take solace in is that you recognized you made someone else feel bad and help yourself not do it again.  Does that help?"
Anxiety,3e0rgm,ndg2006,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:10:51 2015 UTC,"That does help substantially! Thanks. Although I know it rationally, it sometimes takes someone else to be the voice of reason instead of myself.  One more question -- what about the thing I said about my mother? I don't know how to bust out of that funk that something bad will happen to my mother because I said that, even though I recognize it as irrational."

It may take several tries before you find something that brings you relief so don't get discouraged! But please treat yourself now while you have the motivation. If it goes untreated you may get worse and it could discourage you from getting help later on in the future.
Anxiety,3dz28d,TrueTimmy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:16:20 2015 UTC,"I'm a 20 y/o male and I've had some general anxiety as well as depression. I also had some GERD, which is mostly resolved now.  I'm not very sure about how they are related. I definitely feel that, overall, my stomach feels worse when I am anxious. And when my stomach feels bad that makes me anxious. Awesome, amirite?   The doc had me on Prilosec for the GERD, and it barely helped. I was taking a bit or Prilosec and popping TUMS, and it wasn't really resolving. Long story short my mom ended up doing a bit of research that basically convinced us that Prilosec wasn't helping, and might actually be hurting. Seemed more likely that my issue was bacterial overgrowth in my small intestine, leading to bloating after eating certain (or too much) foods. I weaned myself off the Prilosec and made a lot of diet changes, and the GERD mostly disappeared, being triggered only after more major or sustained indulgence in problem foods.  We got a book about it, Fast Tract Digestion: Heartburn by Norm Robillard. I think you can find a lot of the info online, maybe on the author's website, so buying the book may not be necessary.  The main things I have changed are:   Not eating 2-3 hours before lying down (e.g. for bed) Avoiding super sugary foods like soda, pastries, candy... Reducing carb consumption--smaller portions of things like bread, rice, pasta...   I hope this helps. Feel free to ask me for more info or clarification!  EDIT: I also take probiotics and eat a lot of yogurt, but it's harder to tell if that helps.  Also, to clarify, the gist of the issue with GERD meds (allegedly) is that reducing the acidity of your stomach isn't actually helpful, because it allows bacterial overgrowth, leading to more bloating (bacteria feeding on carbs and multiplying)."

The problems I feel when I'm very anxious are more typically a discomfort in my abdomen, like something isn't digesting well. It's hard to say how much the anxiety affects the GERD; I think I noticed that when I had been more anxious for several days my GERD throat symptoms got a bit worse. The main thing that helped was diet modification and weaning myself off the Prilosec, though. I don't know if your issue is similar; hope this helps."

I'm not sure, though. It does sound like your symptoms and causes are somewhat different than mine. I suppose anything that might help you relax your body (meditation, walks, dancing, singing, drinking teas--idk, these help me sometimes) might help somewhat reduce your stomach/throat symptoms."
Anxiety,3e0of7,OneX32,2,Tue Jul 21 01:32:14 2015 UTC,"I am 100% the same way when it comes to therapy. My SO has begged me for years to go in and see counselors when my anxiety and depression get bad. However, I always put it off because it's hard to recognize that therapy is what you need to fix it. That being said, the first phone call is the hardest one to make. If my advice can be offered here, take a deep breath and make the call. You don't need to tell them anything other than that you would like an appointment to see a counselor.  The final thing you need to know is that your mind can be a torture box but you hold the keys to let yourself out. Don't hide the keys from yourself by putting therapy or counseling off. It will suck making that phone call... I know it will be hard, but when it's over you will be able to rest easy that it's done and it may be even easier than you thought it would be."

It usually takes a heavy episode of depression to want to reach out and get the help I know I need. Maybe you are the same way?  That being said, maybe the best way to look at pressing send is what you are doing right now. Think of pressing send as replying to me.

Anxiety,3e0of7,ndg2006,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:57:32 2015 UTC,"I think the easiest way for me to press send is to literally physically force myself to press send without any mental thought put into it.

Anxiety,3dzv1a,adorablebutdangerous,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:40:00 2015 UTC,"I am exactly the same. Every friday i get off work, drive 2 hours to see my bf and spend the weekend at his place, and I'm happy and comfortable with him. By the time sunday morning rolls around, I start having anxiety attacks because I have to drive down in the evening and go back to work. I hate planning vacations because although it feels amazing in the first few days, I spend the last half worrying about how crappy I will feel in the last few days, dreading the return back to work. Unfortunately I feel like the only way for me to cope is to rely on my bf for reassurance and to call him when I am freaking out. Halfway through the workweek I start getting used to the flow of work again. Then the cycle repeats.  In the near future I plan on starting therapy and finding healthier ways to deal with my anxiety. I also feel like I should find a low-stress job that doesn't cause me to dread going to it everyday. I have also considered leaving the medical field entirely. Maybe you can search for something that isn't so stressful? I know it's necessary to have a job but if it makes you miserable then don't feel like you are stuck in it or obligated to stay. Mental health comes first. Personally it is a very comforting thought for me to know that I can leave my job if it makes me too unhappy. I would also try to find a therapist to talk to in the meantime, it seems like therapy has helped a lot of people in this sub.   Good luck!"

Anxiety,3dxjlk,Luhaja,3,Mon Jul 20 18:41:04 2015 UTC,"I just want to sympathize. I have been having a rough week or two and it feels like I'm either anxious or depressed with very little ""normal"" time in between. I have also been focusing on how my anxiety prevented me from experiencing more of life. You are not alone.  I'd also like to share an analogy that your comment made me think of.  I had a job as a dishwasher for a year in highschool.  Over the course of my time there, I washed many, many dishes. It took me some time to learn where everything went and figure out the timing of the dish washing machine. As I got more practice, I was able to do my job faster and better.    I find that anxiety can be very similar. I have been anxious my whole life, worrying about anything that I can worry about and dwelling on things I've done in the past that I regret. After thinking this way for so long, it is like I've ""practiced"" becoming anxious. I can find any little reason to be anxious and I can go from normal to super anxious in no time flat. It is a vicious cycle in this way.  TL;DR Anxiety is almost like a skill, if you practice it you will become very good at it.  With all that said, I still have many days and nights like yours.

Anxiety,3dw4nd,socialawkwardthrow,46,Mon Jul 20 00:55:06 2015 UTC,"I was super anxious about pooping when I first moved in with my boyfriend, and could hardly go at all for like a week. Only when he was at work could I even try. Eventually I got so fed up of my own anxiety that I started just announcing ""well I have to poop"". Once I did that, there was no pressure to pretend like I wasn't pooping, so the anxiety of that started to go away. I was nervous for the same reasons. The first couple times I was still really nervous and embarrassed at just announcing it like that, but a part of me knew that having it out in the open meant there was no reason to get anxious about ""I wonder if he can tell I'm pooping"" and such.   Once you TELL him you're gonna poop, you can't really get anxious about whether or not he's wondering if you're pooping. The awkwardness of nobody mentioning it but silently knowing that you're pooping is where the anxiety comes from. It's like being able to laugh off something embarrassing versus ducking your head and pretending like nothing happened- the elephant in the room is what's making you feel anxious.   For the record, I'd always seen friends and such who are able to just ~announce~ that they had to poop as super confident, no-fucks-given sort of people, and it's nice to finally be one of them, lol. He's not going to see you as gross or anything, if he does then... I mean... no man can last in a relationship if they can't handle girls having bodily functions. The monthly periods alone will eventually do them in. No boy who's worth dating has the right to freak out over girls having to poop in their own bathrooms with the doors shut. I promise, if he's at least relatively sane at all, he's not going to give two shits (lol) about you saying ""hold on I have to poop"" and excusing yourself to do so."

Anxiety,3dw4nd,naturemama,16,Mon Jul 20 14:31:18 2015 UTC,"I'm going to assume if/when he or others stay over, they eventually have to 'go' as well - try noting what you think when it happens.  Do you take notice that they are in there awhile and, oh no, they must be doing something gross in there?  I currently live with my boyfriend, and have been since we got together almost (he moved in when we'd been together barely two months - long story), so I'd of been in dire straights if I hadn't decided to just forget about the anxiety surrounding him finding out that I have, gasp, bodily functions.  As horrible as it is, I'd say just try.  Even if you don't feel the need, once or twice just go to the bathroom and try - you know how long you are in there for your business, stay in and on the pot for duration whether anything comes out or not.  Rinse and repeat.  It'll be a slow process, but eventually when you see nothing happens when you've been in there that duration, it might help ease your mind and thus your body.

First thing you have to keep in mind is that everyone poops. I like to think about all the celebrities that we hold so highly--Brad and Angelina, George Clooney, Kim K--they all poop. It's not weird or unusual onto yourself. Second, find something to help while trying to poop. I used to turn the sink on and read shampoo bottles to relax. And finally, joke about it. Let your boyfriend know before you go in that it's a stinker or don't come knocking or something silly you can laugh at. I promise you he won't break up with you for pooping or think you're some vile, disgusting creature. I used to be uncomfortable pooping in strange places, but these things helped me break past that."
Anxiety,3dw4nd,plentyinsane,3,Mon Jul 20 03:43:49 2015 UTC,"Alright, pooping at home, quick and silent;  You can put down a little bit of paper to muffle the sound, not too much to avoid clogging.   Squat when you poop, you'll be much quicker and it's healthier for your intestines. Have a little footstool close to your toilet, it helps. My poops nowadays take hardly longer than a pee. My partner doesn't even notice when I went #2, unless I announce it or talk in length about it afterwards (I'm weird).  Don't know how you could relax properly, maybe just talking about it? If it's not taboo, just say you have to go. Everybody poops, your partner will understand that you weren't born without an asshole.  Last resort but lasting benefits;  This sounds a bit over the top, and I'm not sure if you can do it, but grab a roll of toiletpaper, go to a forest, find a space where no one can see you and try to poop there. Shock therapy style.  Best results if you go camping for a week plus and resort to this, trust me, it'll get easier. after you manage that, pooping with someone in the same flat will be a breeze."

He knows, and it's not a big deal.  If he cares anything about you at all (and he does since you're together and have been for awhile), he would be mortified that you're enduring pain because you're worried he cares if you're pooping.   2) being confident about it and announcing it as others have suggested will ease any hang ups he may have about going too in your apartment too. You didn't mention if you notice HIM going, but I'm guessing he may also feel a bit weird about it. I think once you both come to terms with it, it will get way way easier.

I could just announce (as others have suggested) 'I'm off to poop, be back in a mo'. As you get to know/trust the other person it does get easier.

That said; it's one of these things you just have to get used to. You are human: a disgusting, sweating, burping, and pooping human - just like the rest of us. There is a good possibility he doesn't view it the same way. And if he does; well I suppose that isn't entirely bad either, perhaps then, you can talk about it and both come to acceptance or develop mutually agreed upon, and semi-pathological rituals where you can live together without ever have to confront each other with your weird disgusting human tendencies."

Keep a pack of matches in the bathroom. after you go and flush, light a match, blow it out, and throw it into the toilet. For some reason, this absorbs a lot of the smell in the room. Also, after you come out, you can always call out the ""5 minute rule"" that my friends and family have. Just announce ""no one goes in that room for 5 minutes"" and laugh. this is no big deal, OP. It's all in your head."
Anxiety,3dw4nd,Offthepoint,17,Mon Jul 20 01:20:15 2015 UTC,It's all in your head is a really crappy piece of advice for an anxiety sufferer. I know it is in my head. I just don't know why my head is broken and everyone around me got one that works just fine. For me it has nothing to do with smell or fear of someone knowing what I'm doing and everything to do with convincing my body it can let its guard down. I also have trouble eating in front of others.
Anxiety,3dw4nd,curlyhairedsheep,4,Mon Jul 20 01:53:27 2015 UTC,"It's all in your head is the perfect advice for an anxiety suffererer, because that used to be me. The worst advice I ever got from people was the ""oh, poor you and your disability"", just do the best you can. That's crap. My anxiety ended when I realized that people don't give a fraction of what you think they do about you, your feelings, your poop, or millions of other things you think they care about. It's the most freeing thing, to realize that anxiety, and all of the crap that goes with it, is all in your head."
Anxiety,3dw4nd,Offthepoint,5,Mon Jul 20 03:06:12 2015 UTC,"The whole thing about anxiety though it that you KNOW your thoughts are irrational, but they are pervasive nonetheless.

I was there, this was me, I experienced it. I had to change my own way of thinking, because no one else can do that for you. Because it's in YOUR HEAD."

Sometimes on these reports they'll say something is suspicious but it's because they didn't look into it like the previous doctor did. Don't go online and research it since it'll make you go even crazier. When I did for headaches I was having (well, head pressure), I thought I had brain swelling and such due to surfing on WebMD."

Anxiety,3dzb6y,aerored82,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:02:10 2015 UTC,"It's an exercise in logic and statistics, and fatalism.  Until you have a final diagnosis, you don't know whether you have no problem, or a big problem. You don't. KNOW.  But you WANT to know NOW. You hate 'not knowing'. You want to start worrying NOW.  On the one hand, the real world.  On the other, your mind playing tricks.  What can you influence right now? Only your mind.  It takes months of GOOD therapy to become cognizant of your biases towards pessimism, fatalism, histrionics, yada yada.  So you ain't gonna be happy tomorrow.  But if you wanted to, you could be trained to avoid this spiral of negativity.  But it sounds like you have that bizarre but deepseated joy of being the victim, the medicalized, the attention seeker. So the question is, will you seek help? Or will you continue to wallow in (currently unjustified) self-pity?  If you don't stop, you won't have many friends left. All they hear is 'me me this, and me me that'. It gets old pretty quick.  The terrible thing is, the medical system makes all this seem normal. After all, for them its a job. And they want to serve, to invoice, to prescribe. They want to avoid litigation, err on the side of caution. This of course is music to your ears...  Actually I am NOT a hard hearted asshole. But this is the objective truth from outside the bubble of your mental affliction. You won't get this from your family or friends, they will lie to your face and say platitudes like 'that's terrible, poor you'. But they don't really believe you, and don't really care because you cried wolf too many times before...  You need to get back to a place where you are not the centre of the universe... engage with others on their terms. Take interest in others' problems. Help them.  THEN if/when you have a real nightmare diagnosis, people will want to support you."
Anxiety,3dzb6y,lildicey,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:07:17 2015 UTC,"Believe me...I have been trying to get help. I just dumped my second therapist in a year because she would just smile and nod as I poured my heart out to her and was trying to convince me hypnosis and staring at colors was going to help my problems. I am on a wait list for a university program that specializes in therapies like CBT/ACT (which I think is more of what I need and won't be getting a call for at least another two weeks. In the mean time, I have been calling therapists up that take my insurance but so far they've all either a) not called me back after repeated tries or b) have been complete duds. One went so far as to call me only to interrupt in the middle of me talking to her to tell me her next client was here and to let her know what I decide to do.   Believe me...this has gone beyond self pity and playing the victim. It might have started that way years ago, but now it's become a compulsion that's basically ruining my life."
Anxiety,3dzb6y,lildicey,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:59:32 2015 UTC,"Great to hear you are focused on resolution.  I know getting help of any kind that even meets minimum competence is tough.  Fact is most therapy really is only to let people vent, and the catharsis this brings...  if you are up to it, you can learn CBT by yourself, as it is only a technique, you don't need to be a professor to figure it out.   But I think you would benefit from proper analysis (I don't know what the current terminology is), i.e. psychiatric? This is a level up from therapy I guess, might need 'prescribing'? I don't know.  For the reason that you have an underlying cause in your past or present that once uncovered and resolved will make the compulsion much easier to fight. I'm guessing, only you can really say if this is a valid point."

What I do think is that you are correct in your epiphany though. A lot of uncertainty in a mind like yours can be very unsettling. I do not know you personally, but I do know the feelings that you describe... especially when it comes to a lot of question marks. It sounds like you have a very analytical mind and it's important to have the details to those events so that you can put them aside.  I am curious if you have taken any medications to help with the intensive thinking or perhaps had any therapy for it? I can definitely say that mindfulness is one way of quieting your brain down, but if you have a lot of uncertainty going on, it can be much harder."

I have had a year and more worth of psychotherapy, so I know that, through practised reflection, deep deep down, positive thoughts and sides to the story do exist. I strive to push those thoughts to the surface when the mindfulness doesn't work.  Also, anti-depressants killed my sex drive. Ayyyyy. I am still trying to fix that one, it's giving me sexual anxiety. I am definitely not the mare I used to be. Beta blockers make me super sleepy and kinda depressed and fat-feeling.   How about you?

These things just makes you feel that way.  Also, you shouldn't feel responsible for your parents' happiness. They're adults, children should not be responsible for their parents' happiness. And by that I mean you shouldn't have to conform or change yourself to suit their view. Ofcourse you should have a basic respect for them, just like you have basic respect for every human being. But it's not your fault if they're not happy.By choosing to be a parent (and they did since they not only had you but your siblings too) they took on the responsibility to take care of you and your siblings.   I know how it feels to think you somehow stand in the way of your parents' happiness, I've been and still am the troubled child, and it sucks to feel this way but try not to get stuck in that way of thinking.

Here's how my medication has helped me: I'm not suicidal anymore, I am not depressed anymore, my anxiety has lessened greatly, I can actually concentrate like a normal person, I'm not sleeping fifteen to twenty hours a day, I have no more brain fog, my appetite has returned to normal, I can actually function, I have much fewer negative thoughts, no more body aches, no more body aches!  I think it's a good idea to consider scheduling an appointment with a general physician first and you will be pointed in the right direction in terms of medication. You will probably have to get some blood work done to rule out any other causes.   If you want to see a therapist, you can go to psychologytoday.com if you're in the US. Use it's therapist finder to find the right therapist for you!  My medication does not sedate me at all. I have so much more energy to do things! Let me know if you have any other questions."
Anxiety,3dyeb8,dwade333miami,3,Mon Jul 20 15:42:24 2015 UTC,"Medication (for me, buspar and oxcarbazepine) doesn't sedate me. It turns the panic noise in my brain down from an 11 to about a 4. I still feel a little anxious from time to time but it's so manageable compared to how it was before. I feel like myself, just calmer.   I also take ativan as needed. That does have a sedative effect, but it works quickly and wears off quickly. The effect is mild. Drowsiness will set in if I take an extra large dose, but normally it just makes me feel slightly tired and relaxed. I take it rarely (2-3x a month, maybe) but it's truly a lifesaver during severe panic attacks."

Before medication and therapy, I would be anxious about everything - I would be anxious about being anxious, it was a vicious cycle. One day I was so anxious I didn't want to go to work. That is when I knew I needed help. I called my doctor that day and started on Zoloft. I still feel anxious from time to time, but I am able to manage my anxiety and prevent it from going to a full blown panic/anxiety attack. Before, I felt like my anxiety controlled me. Now, I feel in control of my anxiety. I've learned some really helpful tools through therapy that help when I start to feel anxious. I definitely recommend therapy in addition to medication. I know the first step of asking for help is hard, but you will not regret it. Take your life back!"
Anxiety,3dyeb8,ExhaustedLove12,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:36:06 2015 UTC,"I started taking medication a little over a year ago after struggling with anxiety over dying when I was little and social anxiety throughout my teen years. The first medication I was prescribed was Paxil and it sucked. I wasn't myself, couldn't sleep and could feel the electricity coursing through my brain. So I stopped medication for a little bit after that, then was prescribed Lexapro. This one had the worst side effects during the first couple weeks. For about a half hour to an hour after taking it, my stomach felt like it was going to explode from pain and I couldn't stop crying. So after a few months of that, I was prescribed Zoloft and that's what I'm currently on.   I'm on 100mg of Zoloft currently. I had been taking it since January, but decided to try to stop taking it probably around a month ago. That was a baaaaaad idea. So I started taking it again about a week ago, I'm going through all the fun initial side effects of insomnia, nausea, but I feel better.   For me, medications make me feel a little buzzed, like I've had a tequila shot or two. I'm just very relaxed and I feel slower, which is nice. Whatever was causing my anxiety is still in my head, but it doesn't affect me as much. The anxiety is still there basically, but I can process it more productively and apply logic to the situation to calm myself down. The side effects are a little sketch, I'm a lot more angry and irritable than usual, but I'm hoping that will subside once the initial trial period is up.   Medications are weird. You have to find the one that works for you, the right dosage, the right time to take it. The side effects can sometimes turn people off of them, but most subside after 6-8 weeks. But I also want to say that medications aren't the only way to combat anxiety, depression, etc. I've actually always been against medications, but I got so bad that I needed something. But there are tons of other ways to quell anxiety, from dietary changes, lifestyle changes, natural remedies, meditation, exercise, there are tons."

You can take advice from others who've tried it but I really really think you should make an appointment anyway and talk to the doctor before you let yourself get set on taking it or not taking it. They will be able to tell you so much more and help you figure out whether its something that will truly benefit you or not-- its their job after all.    I went and decided after two appointments not to. And both drs I saw said they are still willing to work with me and try other things even though I declined medication."

Alcohol exacerbates a lot of the symptoms of mental illness, especially with depression and certain personality disorders (bipolar and alcohol never mix well - personal experience).

Most of the CBT I have had points to doing more of what makes you feel like this. Easier said than done, obviously.

They may even prescribe Prozac or some other anti-depressant which has a longer half life to take while weaning off of the Lexapro.  Lexapro (from my understanding) has awful withdrawal symptoms and further more has serious withdrawal effects for higher dosages and long time users (seizures etc).    My advice, don't cut it cold turkey, check with your doc for a safe way to do it, that'll yield the best results."

Last year I decided that I would withdraw from venlafaxine, one of the hardest antidepressants to stop taking... I went from 75 mg to 37.5 instantly and waited for a long while... I regained much clarity and felt great for a while, so I figured - if I'm getting better the more I stop taking, then I really need to stop...  I found the site :""surviving antidepressants"" wherein I learnt of a method where you can take venlafaxine out of the capsules - count the beads, and slowly withdraw. As I withdrew successfully from benzodiazepines in the past - I had some knowledge of how you may need to be very careful when withdrawing....  Once I had reduced to something like 4.7 mg of the venlafaxine I started having great cramps in my legs. I started having panic attacks, and powerful insomnia... Unaware of what was causing it, but somehow thinking it might be withdrawal - I went to see a doctor about switching to prozac so that the apparent withdrawal symptoms would disappear.   Doing so was one of the greatest mistakes in my life...  I started having the most obscene panic attacks, suicidal ideation, muscle cramps, inability to sleep, powerful heartbeat and other such things... I did not think at the time that it was related to withdrawal as I had been very careful with withdrawing...   Not careful enough..  After a few weeks of some of the most hellish hours I have ever experienced on this planet - I came to the thinking that I had to do something drastic... I made certain my doctor got me back on 37.5 mg of venlafaxine...   Fast forward to now, and I'm still having some withdrawal symptoms but they have lessened to the point that I can experience happiness and joy in life... The question is, will you react as badly as me? probably not, venlafaxine is one of the most dire antidepressants to come down from.  However - this is a warning to you... Do not make the same mistake as I did with this class of drugs. The brains nervous system takes 1 month to feel the changes you make to the drug... THAT MEANS - That if you reduce with too much a given month, that you will only feel the bad effects a month after or perhaps more.   This makes withdrawing from antidepressants incredible hard for some people who are incapable of tolerating withdrawal syndrome - and I suspect that this is the same wall you crashed into... You will likely see more success if you get into your head that this is an endevour that atleast takes a year - or more, but going drug free is definately worth the sacrifice!  May luck be more with you, than it was with me."
Anxiety,3dy8j9,haka9845876125438446,2,Mon Jul 20 17:39:19 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, I'm so sorry that happened to you :( My GP wanted to put me on that and I wound up finding a psychiatrist instead because the GP wasn't listening to my concerns. And yeah the withdrawal was hellish the second time I did it. Not the first for whatever reason, though. I'm hoping the third time's the charm."
Anxiety,3dy8j9,throwseeds,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:30:52 2015 UTC,"I'm fine though, the main issue I'm having right now is that my psychiatrist and acquaintances do not believe my story. The funny thing is though - my psychiatrist thinks that it is stress related - that my central nervous system is out of whack, and that I produce too much of the stress hormone cortisol...  Withdrawal syndrome from antidepressants make your central nervous system out of whack, and your body ends up producing too much of the stress hormone cortisol - the medical profession just hasn't caught up to the fact that protracted withdrawal syndrome from antidepressants are a thing - just like the medical profession was slow to understand that benzodiazepines could have protracted withdrawal syndrome - and just like it was slow to understand that benzodiazepine withdrawal was a thing.  I would suggest that you listen to patients more than psychiatrists more on this matter if you feel like something isn't as it should be in reguards to your condition - that way of thinking basically 'saved' me - because if I hadn't had the foresight to start up on venlafaxine again, I would possible be in a grave somewhere having taken my own life...  Scary stuff I know! But nonetheless I feel it is the truth, and feel the need to share it. Hopefully armed with my experience, you will be more cautious than I was, if that is the case, then I have done my job.  Good luck! :)"
Anxiety,3dyl0d,iguessthatsall,3,Mon Jul 20 16:16:34 2015 UTC,"Changing your career, location and what have you will likely never bring you relief from anxiety. Anxiety is something you will have to face head on by therapy, medication and other practices. If you need any ideas to try feel free to ask me.  There is no right or wrong path in life, as long as it is genuinely what you want to do. It's okay to not have a grip on what you'd like to do for the rest of your life, so give yourself a break. It's not necessary that you decide this instant. Explore ideas and interests. Maybe take a couple of free online courses."

Anxiety,3dyl0d,azauqyar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:50:48 2015 UTC,Cognitive behavioral therapy in particular will be helpful to you. It works to get rid of distorted thoughts (i.e. black and white.) It will make it to where your thoughts are more positive. I know it sounds too simple to work but I've had a good experience with changing distorted thought patterns.

It is your generalized anxiety demon talking through your subconciousness - he is not worthy of listening to - trust me on that!   My main solution have oftentimes been to drink some chamomile if the demons voice becomes too loud.   You may gain something from doing cognitive behaviorial therapy with a therapist - it has a proven efficacy for these kinds of demonic voice issues.   There are also certain mindfulness meditation technigues that have some proven efficacy for these kinds of things - a therapist may again be of aid.

Anxiety,3dz1g7,Luhaja,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:21:04 2015 UTC,"Also the heart palpitations are a very normal symptom of anxiety. It happens when the generalized anxiety demon speaks to your mind, your heart is then scared by what the demon says because the demonic intrusive thoughts cause distress to the heart. It is not something to be afraid of, and limiting caffeine intake and stimulants will generally decrease the amount of heart palpitations you have... Also make sure your salt intake is not too high, because that too is disrupting to your heart.   Lastly, chilli pepper extracts can decrease heart palpitations by being enourmously beneficial to your heart, so if you're in a situation where you fear for your heart, well chilli pepper extracts have been known to stop heart attacks, so that is good to have around."
Anxiety,3dz1g7,Luhaja,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:26:50 2015 UTC,"I can relate. Growing up I used to get stinging pains on the left side of my chest, probably all made up from anxiety. My legs and arms also fall asleep easily.  Hearing my heartbeat on a monitor gets me anxious. So does any pressure on my chest, like if you've ever had an ultrasound taken of your heart. I did - because I was worried about my heart. This was when I was like 17 and they said it was completely healthy. Helped relieve the anxiety about it a little.  I still have anxiety+depression and every once in a while I get a palpitation (or something that feels like one). I try to ignore it as best I can by assuming it is just a spasm in my chest muscles."

Anxiety,3dxmxe,hollybubbles,5,Mon Jul 20 11:23:04 2015 UTC,"Great!   Just to let you know, there are options to get professional help if you don't have insurance and/or money is an issue. The reason why I'm mentioning this is because you deserve to be happy and healthy. My therapists and psychiatrists saved my life, and there are professionals out there who are passionate about helping you. Here are some options...  1) You can google the name of your town/a nearby one + free clinic or free mental health clinic. See what comes up! There are many clinics that are specifically for people who do not have insurance and/or have a lower income. If you're in the US, maybe you can use psychologytoday.com's treatment facility finder.  2) To find a therapist, you can look for therapists who charge on a sliding scale. You can google the name of your town/a nearby one + sliding scale therapist, or you can go to psychologytoday.com's therapist finder if you're in the US. Search by your zip code or city and click on a therapist's profile. Scroll down to the bottom where it says finances, and if it says sliding scale: yes, then you're in luck because the price you pay can be negotiated! Therapy charged on a sliding scale is much cheaper than regular-priced therapy.  3) To find a doctor, you can look for a psychiatrist who charges on a sliding scale (psychologytoday.com also has a psychiatrist finder), or you can go to a general physician, which is generally cheaper than seeing a psychiatrist. You don't have to take medication, as that's entirely your decision that I respect, but it may be a good idea to get some blood work done to rule out any causes like thyroid problems.  As for being too anxious to find a professional, I understand because I was the same way myself. On psychologytoday.com, each therapist's profile has contact information like an email address and/or phone number. You can email a few therapists with a brief background of your anxiety."

Just because your problems have been solved doesn't mean that stress is not still effecting you on a subconscious level.   I also have anxiety and struggle with motivation. I'm not sure how it is linked though.   The caffeine might have played a role if you are sensitive to it. Hoping you feel better soon.

The art piece I have in mind would function as both a viewing piece, but also have an ever subtle degree of interactivity within it as well. It wouldn't require to much skill, I just need to kind of learn to use photoshop so I can get the results I want. From there it's just a technical process of transferring an image to canvas, which isn't too difficult by the looks of things.   I have so much writing stuff I'd like to work on, but it's like past initial idea generation, my head just simmers out. I like walking because it seems like moving is how I get my mind rolling and thinking of ideas as well. These past few days I have been putting in a little more effort to try and write, but again, it's tough. I lose my train of thought*, lose focus, and find I have trouble continuing to write as a result.   *a note on this statement;  How in the fuck can you lose a train? For something to be lost, one needs to not know where it is. The convenient thing about trains is that we generally have an idea where they go because they're kind of dependent on the metal tracks that carve their way so brutally through the landscape. Maybe the statement ought to me 'missed' my train of thought, because no one in history has ever lost a train. You're bound to find it eventually because the trails right in front of you."

Anxiety,3dyn29,ComradeZac,3,Mon Jul 20 16:31:01 2015 UTC,"Men approaching me makes me flustered and anxious. However, I have an anxiety disorder and really low self esteem so I don't feel like I can adequately relate to most other women. Also, context is important. If you're at a bar or club it's more expected that as a woman you will be approached by men with romantic/sexual intent. Waiting in line at the bank, not so much."
Anxiety,3dyn29,Skycakes,2,Mon Jul 20 16:49:53 2015 UTC,"I have social anxiety and I hate, hate, hate being hit on or approached unexpectedly by someone with romantic intent. This is because the other person WANTS something from me and I feel as if it puts a lot of pressure on me to respond in a way that is ""nice"" or doesn't hurt their feelings. It's hard to remember that I don't owe other people anything and actually do not have to worry about their feelings if I say no. Obviously I don't want to be cruel and rude, but a simple ""No, thank you,"" or ""I'm not interested,"" is just fine.   So what I'm saying is... you can't judge your appeal or worth based on how women you casually approach react to you.   I think dating sites/apps/singles' events/etc. are great because then you know for sure that the people involved are looking to get to know someone else rather than having to work up your courage and approach someone ""out in the wild"" where they might be busy, not in the mood, already taken, or simply not interested more often than not."

Seeing your post in r/amiugly, and from your replies on this thread, there is nothing wrong with your looks/method.  But everyone is different, and every girl will react differently.  I am in a committed relationship, and honestly, if you came up to hit on me in that manor, I would be very flattered, but would have to turn you down due to my relationship status.  The key is not to lose confidence, or to start thinking the issue is worth you.  There are a LOT of women out there, and they all behave/react differently, for a variety of different reasons.  Not all of them react nicely.  Some will be mean.  But the only thing that will keep you from meeting a girl that will become your girlfriend will be to give up.  Don't give up!"

About getting checked out, you probably aren't noticing. I have social anxiety, and I think /no one/ has ever checked me out, you could be 1 meter away and be staring at my boobs for a full minute and I'd be thinking I got some stain on my shirt. I will be uncomfortable, but I will misinterpret it all the same. If you have low self esteem and see someone acting in a way you don't understand, you'll never think ""oh they're into me"".

My anxiety is the opposite of that. I would feel the most anxious when I was alone and my thoughts (often irrational) would take over. Unfortunately, this happened all the time when I was alone at my desk at work. The week before I started Zoloft, I couldn't sit still because of my anxiety. I had to be up and doing something, which sometimes was just walking around my office building, or cleaning back in the warehouse. I was nervous about my job, thinking I could no longer work a desk job. Then one day I woke up and didn't want to go to work. I didn't know how I was going to survive 8 hours at my desk and I knew I couldn't find 8 hours of stuff to do in the warehouse. I finally made an appointment with my doctor and was prescribed medication. I feel alive again! I still have anxiety, but the meds and therapy have helped quiet the anxious thoughts in my head.   I want you to know you are not alone and that it can get better. You don't have to feel like this. The first and often hardest step is asking for help. You can do it!"

Not to be flippant,  I am curious why being on holiday is more of a problem than usual. Is it the strange location, inescapable family members,  lack of exercise, or the heat maybe? Maybe the mode of travel?  Also how come your faith is dwindling if the methods are 'tried and true'?  Surely if you do it, it will work.  Breathe.  Finally, do you think you need the meds?  What would happen if you tapered down instead of up?    Finally finally, do you live a virtuous lifestyle, with plenty of exercise, not too much caffeine, lots of sleep?"
Anxiety,3dz9cw,aerored82,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:14:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I subscribe to the term virtuous. The definition would tend to differ culturally and seems to be more of a judgement than a question. Nevertheless to answer that question I stopped drinking caffeine and any other stimulants when I started having anxiety after a head injury around 7 months ago that brought on the panic attacks and anxiety. I am in good health and get plenty of exercise. I am lucky to have a job that is both physical and rewarding. I get more sleep than the average person due to my work hours. In response to the meds question I actually prefer not to take them at all, as I am not a fan of pharmaceuticals. I am apprehensive to take two ib profin unless my pain is unbearable. I'm on the lowest dose of Ativan I've heard anyone taking which is .5. I was offered more but I asked for a lower dose. I have never taken two of these .5's at once. The most I've ever taken was a shot I got at an urgent care after my first panic attack. I only got a script for them because I didn't want to delay my wife and family on our trip. Mostly I was scared of having a panic attack on a plane or the cruise ship we were on. I didn't want to embarrass them or myself any further. Although I consider myself an open minded person, I do have pride. The methods are somewhat new to me, I started therapy a month ago and started using a few techniques that were really working for me. Working although not full proof. I would have a few days of strength using them then a big let down when I wasn't able to escape the mental quicksand that leads to my anxiety. I am still working with them. I am finding posting here and getting my thoughts out to people suffering with the same problem is helpful and I am truly grateful for your response and the time you took to read my post. I think on vacation the stresses come with the heat and a lot of information all at once. These things have been triggers in the past. Also anticipation seems to set my receptors off as well. I love breweries and beer! It's a hobby of mine to brew and collect growlers from all the breweries I visit around the world. It's my father in laws as well, who we are traveling with. The medication paired with alcohol can make you drowsy which is another trigger for me (only during the day). I'm trying very hard to listen to what my therapist has taught me and give myself the credit when I make through a hard day. Today was really hard but I got through it and I actually ended up having a good day. Only two more days of vacation and travel and I'll be home and able to continue on my work with my therapist. Positivity is hard for me. But I am trying."
Anxiety,3dz9cw,aerored82,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:18:00 2015 UTC,"Wow, second time today a poster has surprised me by relating how much effort they are making to stay or get well. I think you have it covered. But I have some more thoughts:  Brain injury sounds kinda serious, and to my mind justifies meds.  I use the word virtuous because it is rare and sought after behavior. It seems you are?  If you were a beer monster, I might not think so much...!  It's surprising to me that alcohol causes your symptoms,  but perhaps its interacting with the meds? That's not always a good idea, i feel embarrassed to have suggested it, sorry.  I sometimes guess wrong, but may i suggest you are a independent strongminded person, unused to 'woolly' mind tricks?  You've not needed to consider things like stress before, perhaps they have a vaguely unmanly aspect... if this is how you are /feel then perhaps it's worth talking to a professional as the brain injury, or whatever caused it, may have been a threshold moment in your life, after which your tolerance for stress isn't what it used to be... you might even have a form of PTSD.  Stress and anxiety are closely related, so perhaps the holiday is actually quite a mental or emotional strain for you.  While you think of it as fun, your subconscious only understands intensity, it doesn't care if the stress is positive or negative.   But maybe you don't think of your lifestyle in terms of stressors... the big issue is that worry in one area e.g. money, can use up your tolerance to stress, so that you are anxious in somewhere bizarre like the mall, and you think 'what was that about?'.  Fear on a plane or boat seems to me like this. You are not normally afraid of either, but you baseline stress is high for some reason causing anxiety to 'leak out' in situations when normally you would just be fine.  (example in point, your holiday would be a living nightmare for me: trapped on a boat, surrounded by strangers, unable to escape family, responsible for others, planning, maybe worried about work, business, home while you're gone)  So back to your current issue, I get the feeling you think you have no more 'ammo' to fight the attacks... but you admit that you haven't really pushed the boundaries of either the meds OR the mind tricks... so you just need to go harder with either or both until you get back home."

I'm sorry that she did you like that, some people are just heartless. Keep working, be open about how you're feeling with your friends if they're supportive and you trust them. Don't worry if you seem like you're attention seeking, you just need support and that won't be a burden at all. It is just temporary neediness.  Don't think about trying to win her back or things you should have done or said. Let yourself feel your emotions but live your life at the same time. In a sense, you are being overdramatic but that's just a symptom of being over-sensitized because of what she did.  Trust other people to be there for you, whether they're your friends in person, your family, or people right here on this subreddit."
Anxiety,3dxw9v,mikerowaev,2,Mon Jul 20 15:24:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is anxiety. You would be surprised how many people struggle with anxiety. The very best thing you can do is talk to your friends about it. You won't be a burden. You will probably find that some of your friends struggle with anxiety too.  The good news is that time will heal this. Be careful not to internalize this. Each relationship is a learning experience, and the pain of losing partners is part of the growth process. You will make it through and be happy and healthy again. :)"
Anxiety,3dxw9v,blueovariesallday,2,Mon Jul 20 14:57:16 2015 UTC,"It sounds like depression related anxiety since it came after you broke up with your girlfriend.   Here's what I want you to do.   Talk to a doctor, asap, and get an appointment with a therapist while you're at it.    This step is such a huge and large step that I will refrain from writing more - come back here once you've done it, and I'll throw even more suggestions your way."

Anxiety,3dz3q6,ZThrowawayLife,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:26:36 2015 UTC,"Well, first things first - even if you are a trigger, that DOES NOT give him a right to lash out at you.  That should not be condoned, enabled, or downplayed.  He knows he's hurting you, he continues doing it while knowing he's doing it, and only stops when you threaten to leave - that is abusive behavior, no matter what way you cut it.  He may have severe anxiety, but he should not be allowed to use to excuse him mistreating you now that you are no longer in a relationship.  That aside - you  need to take care of yourself.  I'd sit down with him, and tell him for once and for all you are done.  He gets one more chance to not be crummy to you, and if he takes it out on you again, you are gone, no ifs, ands, or buts about it.  No discussion, no questions, no venting - just gone.  If he takes it out on you again, cut ties, period - because at that point, he cares more about venting then on being a good friend to you.  You can't really do anything to be 'non-threatening' - because you aren't threatening.  Be yourself, do what you normally do.  He's grieving the loss of the relationship, and nothing you do will change that.  Once his (and you) finish grieving and move on past it, that is when you'd see if the friendship can be sustained - if it's still a thing at that point, that is."
Anxiety,3dxcuo,moriane2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:59:54 2015 UTC,Guy here. The way I would do it would be baby steps. You may be putting the cart before the horse a little. Take some time to get to know the guy. Don't rush it. Hold hands when you are ready. Make it known to him if he goes too quickly that you need to slow down. Progress slowly from there. I have never been terrified of that sort of thing but I want to help so hopefully I've done that.  There is someone for everyone. The right person will understand.

Anxiety,3dxkog,Rendog101,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:52:42 2015 UTC,"I take my xanax as needed and sparingly since its habit forming. When I went from 25mg to 50mg Zoloft I really noticed a difference in my depression and my anxiety although it sounds like yours might be worse than mine. I felt like it only took a couple weeks, if that, to notice the changes. As much as I liked Zoloft, I had to switch because it was ruining my sex life..  Personally I'd up the zoloft and try to see how it helps your anxiety and only take Valium when you really need it."

Anxiety,3dxkog,goatofglee,0,Mon Jul 20 13:34:28 2015 UTC,"So I recently tried to wean off my medication, 200mg of Zoloft being one of them. I got down to 25mg before my doctor and I felt that Zoloft was actually doing something positive for me. Without it I found myself more anxious and more...on edge. I'm now at 150mg and doing much better. I can't say I remember how long it took to work when I first started, but it's been working for me the past few years.   One thing, though, if I forget/fall asleep before I take Zoloft, I can feel the effects the next day, and I'm miserable.  Good luck!"

Congratulations on stopping to panic attack before it began- that is huge and will also get easier.  At the height of my anxiety I felt like my world was in a big rubber band and I had to keep pushing my boundaries farther and farther out.  If I stopped trying, my comfort zone would shrink again.  Keep pushing yourself and keep doing more and going farther.  You will be amazed at how quickly your comfort zone will grow.  Great job today!!"

But remember, you are in control of what you put in your body, and if its not making you feel right anymore, then maybe it's time for something else. It's weird, but sometimes a medication we've relied on for so long can sometimes backfire and cause the anxiety it was keeping at bay. At the same time, take a step back and try to assess if there's anything else in your life that is giving you anxiety. Write down anything that could be causing your heightened anxiety, including the Cymbalta. It very well might be the cymbalta, but on the same token, it might be something else!"
Anxiety,3du6n9,jellyfishp0op,27,Sun Jul 19 14:41:29 2015 UTC,"I have (and still occasionally do) experience this exact same feeling. Like EXACT, down to the wanting to kill myself/repeating it/I'm never leaving this bed again/never seeing those people again thoughts. You know what it is? It's shame at having lowered your inhibitions to the point of acting in ways you wouldn't normally act in your day-to-day sober life. This can be healthy if you're a really reserved/inhibited person. Granted, I definitely made some mistakes while drinking that I wouldnt have made sober and the shame I felt after those nights was justified. I also had a history of blacking out. My advice to you: don't stop going out. DO limit yourself to how many drinks you have if you're worried about overdoing it. Leave your debit card at home and just bring 20-30 dollars out with you. That's your limit. If you always remember what you said, you can calmly and rationally analyze it. It also helps if someone else does or says something way dumber than you ever would. Also, remember this: even if you can clearly recall everything you said and did, I bet you can't remember exactly what everyone else said and did. It's the same for everyone else. I'm still dealing with these thoughts/feelings but it actually felt good to start stepping up as the DD sometimes, having 2-3 drinks, dropping everyone off, and then going home to my private party of 1 as the DD hero who had a decent time out."
Anxiety,3du6n9,stomachless_hunger,7,Sun Jul 19 16:38:24 2015 UTC,I think you hit the nail on the head with the shame part. I definitely overanalyze everything I did/said and make myself feel bad for being so open when I normally am more reserved. It really helps to look at it in a different perspective and think that no one probably remembers every little thing I did or said just like I wouldn't be able to recall every little thing they did or said. Thanks for this. It really helps to know that there are others who go through the same thing.

Anxiety,3du6n9,princessfart,26,Mon Jul 20 12:37:19 2015 UTC,"It's the alcohol making you feel that way. I would take a break from going out/ or just take a break from drinking (sometimes I'll just get one drink and not drink the rest of the night because I still want to go out but not be hammered). Idk what you do for self care (if you do anything) but you need to either start or add more in your routine. Things like plenty of sleep, good nutrition, exercise, and the right amount of alone time can make a huge difference in your levels of anxiety.   You should also see a therapist if you haven't already. This will help immensely."
Anxiety,3du6n9,bigman1234561113,3,Sun Jul 19 15:10:26 2015 UTC,"I am active and I do eat relatively healthy but I have an immensely difficult time with sleep.

Anxiety,3du6n9,KnittedOwl,8,Sun Jul 19 20:40:23 2015 UTC,Alcohol kills me.  It really triggers my anxiety x100 the next day.  I've just avoided it now for a long time.
Anxiety,3du6n9,cameronsheart,5,Sun Jul 19 21:03:41 2015 UTC,The medications I'm on make me very sick from drinking. I get the same feelings. But I also have a codiagnosis of bipolar disorder.   If you get those feelings it's probably best to not drink. I've become the DD and it's great. People will buy my nonalcoholic drinks and food all night and I feel so much better and safer.
Anxiety,3du6n9,PoppaDR3W,2,Sun Jul 19 22:23:12 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I was going to say! Even if it's not the downer (i.e. alcohol) that is getting you down, you'll be rewarded with people appreciating you as the DD. It'll avoid any potential embarrassments from drinking and, even if you do something embarrassing, they're the ones drinking. They'll likely forget in the next 10 minutes.  Most people have the common decency to at least buy you a soda or dinner for keeping them safe. Some people will even pay for gas. That's nice for if you're worried about financial issues."
Anxiety,3du6n9,PoppaDR3W,5,Mon Jul 20 00:50:52 2015 UTC,"Alcohol makes me feel a bit nutty as well. Not as bad as it used to be, but days after, like today, I get anxiety much easier and I feel sick (nausea). I feel like I'm going to have a seizure, despite never having one.  It's hard to cut alcohol out of our lives, given it is a social norm these days. I'd say maybe cut it down at least. Maybe try light beer so you get a higher volume with less alcohol content, so you'll drink less.  But you're not alone. Alcohol is a depressant, do of course it affects us in a major way. Then it takes days ź at least for me - to regain my composure."
Anxiety,3du6n9,whyamidrunk,3,Sun Jul 19 17:43:29 2015 UTC,It also takes me a day or two to get my head right again. I think sticking to beer and limiting my drinks is a pretty good plan to help control these feelings. Thank you :)

Last time I went to a party, I left and immediately deleted all of my friends numbers and swore not to ever talk to them again because I thought they hated me. Death feelings are not as strong for me now as they were in the past, but they are still there. I hope they will totally go some day.   I have cut god knows how many people out of my life.

Anxiety,3du6n9,Und3rach13v3r,3,Sun Jul 19 22:23:28 2015 UTC,Alcohol is a depressant. That means any amount you drink can make you more likely to get the blues. Drinking a lot can harm your brain and lead to depression.
Anxiety,3du6n9,Und3rach13v3r,3,Sun Jul 19 23:10:36 2015 UTC,"I had this feeling around a year ago. Every morning after I'd had a lot to drink I literally wanted to die. Not the ""haha I'm so hungover I want to die"" kinda feeling - I just didn't want to exist. After one particularly bad evening I decided to stop drinking for a while. I didn't put a time frame on it but it ended up being around 6-7 months until I simply 'felt' ready again.  I tried limiting my drinking when going out but that gave me the same feeling - it was just a little less extreme.   I can drink any amount I want now but if I do something awkward or drunk text or something I still feel shame/embarrassment but I don't want to die."
Anxiety,3du6n9,Punk4lif-e,4,Sun Jul 19 17:42:17 2015 UTC,"Alcohol is a depressant and magnifies emotions, even the next morning. I don't drink more than two because of this. I went through a period where I couldn't even have a beer without being in a funk for the next 24 hours."
Anxiety,3du6n9,UndeadKitten,3,Sun Jul 19 19:11:35 2015 UTC,"Alcohol does the same thing to me. I went through a period of going out regularly and I always felt horrible after, even for a few days after. I've mostly cut out alcohol since then and couldn't be happier. I have been out more than usual in the last month, though, and I can feel it.   Try limiting how much you drink when you go out, or take a break from it altogether. It sounds like drinking is exacerbating any sort of anxious feelings you're having. Just know that you're not alone. :) Good luck."

Anxiety,3du6n9,UndeadKitten,2,Sun Jul 19 22:44:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Yeah, I remember talking to someone about it either here or in the chatroom and I was surprised at how many people chimed in to say, ""Me too!"" when I mentioned having these feelings. It can be comforting to know that lots of other people struggle with the same things you do. Sounds like you're headed in the right direction! At least you recognize that this isn't good for you and you're working on changing it somehow."
Anxiety,3du6n9,Punk4lif-e,3,Mon Jul 20 02:16:04 2015 UTC,I thought it was just me. I have felt the exact way so many times it makes it so i can't get out of bed the next morning and have tried to hurt myself.

Anxiety,3dyhng,badplacern,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:52:55 2015 UTC,"Hello there! I'm sorry to hear that you're having a hard time. There are a myriad of SSRIs you could try and unfortunately it's just a trial and error of what works best for you so please don't get discouraged. If you find your SSRI is not giving you relief then please don't hesitate to ask your doctor for another.   I was just thinking last night about how much my life has changed. I've been on viibryd(ssri) for about two of three months now and it's the first time I've been medicated in two years. I wish I would've done it sooner. I used to hate myself, my job performance decreased as my anxiety got worse. I used to spend my life feeling like I was in a daze and dwelling on every little thing I did wrong while my self confidence dwindled away. Now, my self confidence is better, I actually want to go out and do things. It truly does get better, you just have to put the effort in. But this is not entirely because of the SSRI. Look into r/buddhism if you can, a lot of their philosophies have helped me tremendously. Look into thought distortions and how to change or edit your thoughts. Eating well and exercising have done wonders for me as well, maybe if you can stand to just walk around the block or the house even.  As for staying home a lot, that's fine! I spend most days like that. Just make sure it's because it's a preference rather than out of fear. As for the IBS thing, it often coincides with anxiety. Maybe you could plan to go out with a friend or family member where you know there will be a bathroom just so you can push your boundaries without feeling too anxious.  And if you have any questions feel free to message me! :)"

Anxiety,3dvdim,bigman1234561113,5,Sun Jul 19 21:01:10 2015 UTC,"i totally understand feeling regret over things from the past, even if it doesnt seem completely reasonable or worthy of regret. i usually refer to it as getting stuck in my head; stuck in a vicious cycle of bad memories, and it OFTEN happens when im trying to go to sleep. but it can happen anywhere and i think there is a way to force yourself out of that cycle, using willpower, and distracting yourself, and also learning to be fully HONEST with yourself about accepting the things you cant change, and cutting yourself some slack. anxiety makes it easy for you to be honest about your negative aspects, its a skill tht you CAN aquire to learn to be honest about your positive aspects, and to learn to be kind to yourself.   when im in bed having a panic attack over shit from highschool or family or whenever the hell long ago i like to just try to CLEAR MY MIND and focus on thinking NOTHING. sometimes by mentally repeating a word like ""clearrrrrrr"" (like a personal 'ommm"") or a phrase like ""just keep swimming"" over and over (this one is good if im walking somewhere cuz its a rhythm) and if i notice myself thinking anything other than that i force myself to go back to my repetition; like meditating, and i will do this anywhere i need to; rushing to work, on the subway, in crowds etc. sometimes you just need something to stop the train of negativity in your head. again, its not something that is necesarily easy you need to practice it like a skill but it DOES get easier. and it works no matter what kind of anxiety im feeling; regret about the past, fear of the future, social situations, whatever. the meditation-style response has become very helpful for me.  i believe in you, its going to be ok <3"
Anxiety,3dvdim,RememberElephants,2,Sun Jul 19 21:20:10 2015 UTC,"Do not worry friend. I worry all the time about things I shouldn't. I can't help it, the thoughts get stuck in my head. I always think there's something wrong with me when it comes to my health. I can't control the thoughts, or so I think, I'm working on it with meditation. But from the sounds of it, just go talk to your parents and maybe resolve some uneasy feelings."
Anxiety,3dvdim,FluffleUffle,2,Mon Jul 20 04:48:03 2015 UTC,"This happens to me. I get stuck in an end less cycle of guilt and anxiety thinking about the past and all the things I wish I could change. I was dishonest with the people that took me in when I was 17 and it used to keep me up at night. I finally decided after 5 years of being distant from them to write an apology to them. I think its never too late and I think it will maybe help you. Maybe write it and hold on to it. Just getting everything down on paper was an immense relief for me. As for the anxiety I take walks, I read and watch documentaries. Don't be afraid to reach out to friends. Ive been upfront with my friends about my anxiety. I kept my diagnosis to myself for a long time. When I finally got medication and was having trouble adjusting people noticed. I finally confessed and I was surprised by how many people were really understanding and reached out and have been extremely supportive. This is a rambling message but this is the first time I've read a situation- that I have found myself in. Good luck!"
Anxiety,3dvdim,dancing_cloud_,2,Mon Jul 20 04:57:47 2015 UTC,I know that struggle very well. When I start regretting things in the past I try and keep in mind that there is nothing I can do about it anymore. The only thing I can do about it now is to be the best person I can be. Everybody makes mistakes and some people have done worse than what I have or you have. Keepin that in mind they can be forgiven which means we can as well. Just try and do the best you can for the now to make up for it. This isn't always easy and you have to really think it out and try and calm down.

So I obsess and get stuck in loops. You aren't alone!  What do I recommend? Find a hobby. Exercise. I know its super dumb, saying stuff like that. But it's true. Find something you enjoy, and make that your activity on the weekends. Actively plan for it. That way, it doesnt feel like downtime-- you have something to do.   Let me know if I can do anything to help you, good luck! :-)"
Anxiety,3dw764,somethingsarcastic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:47:20 2015 UTC,"I'd say the only hobby I have that seems to keepr stimulated enough to feel busy is video games. On Saturdays I usually hang with some friends that enjoy playing the same game as me, and sometimes that's nice. When it comes to Sunday though I feel this overwhelming need to make that day matter. Almost like the last day of summer vacation used to feel, if that makes sense, but more about it being a lot of pressure and stress and less about just being excited to have a good time.  Exercise is a good idea. I don't want to do that on days with my girlfriend since I know she isn't remotely motivated to do so and I'd just get frustrated being on different wavelengths about it. My main beef with that is that when I'm anxious I tend to have (or think I have) a super high heart rate. It's so much so that now when I have a higher heart rate from anything (adrenaline, excitement, etc.) I think I'm having a mini anxiety attack, and then that causes me to do so."
Anxiety,3dw764,mbz321,3,Mon Jul 20 02:19:06 2015 UTC,"Yep, I know how you feel. I somehow ended up with a 3-day weekend this week from work (rare in the world of retail) and I'm pretty much going crazy. Honestly, it seems work is my only real 'hobby' nowadays, but I enjoy working. I originally had plans that didn't work out (which was supposed to at least fill the time yesterday), so I ended up really not doing much of anything exciting all weekend, and I still have another day to fill tomorrow.  Just wondering, do you feel like your anxiety is worse in the daytime and slowly goes down once the sun goes down? That's how I am.  I find that changing your environment, even for a short period of time, tends to help me somewhat, even something simple like a walk around the block or sitting in the sun. Maybe you and your girlfriend could find a nice park or even a mall/shopping area/farmers market nearby and just take a walk around...it doesn't have to be extreme exercise or anything. Go out and see a movie. Or if you have a car, maybe drive off to a new town just for a change of scenery. Staying in my house (room) all day just makes things worse for me in the long run. (I actually just came back from the gym right now which helped to burn off some built-up energy.)"
Anxiety,3dw764,SamX1962,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:20:52 2015 UTC,"I'd say that throughout the the week, it's definitely better at night, and maybe a bit on Sunday but usually the later it gets before I settle in the night, the worse.  I totally agree with your point about changing scenery though. It totally does help. I think my problem too is that when I get like this I really hate company, so when it happens during social outings it's really stressful. D:"
Anxiety,3dw764,Miss_Ann_Thropy,2,Mon Jul 20 03:38:31 2015 UTC,To me it it sounds like (correct if I'm wrong) that there is an aspect of your workplace that you might not enjoy or dread as your anxiety revolves around the time intervals before and after work. Something to consider?
Anxiety,3dwsde,krafandiko,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:34:34 2015 UTC,"Thought I would just post to say that I do this too. I constantly imagine scenarios of people criticizing me or just me stuffing up and getting into trouble. I go through periods when this is better but then it comes back again. The only thing that has helped me is practicing mindfullness. I read a really good book called the 'happiness trap' which really helped me to get out of my head and back into reality. My head was a really hopeless and scary place so it was great when I learnt to accept my thoughts but then reengage with the here and now. I'm still not perfect, and I do still go through really anxious periods, however I have the tools to deal with them and know that 'this will pass'. Hope this helps somewhat"
Anxiety,3dwsde,starburst156,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:57:42 2015 UTC,"I do this, too. I'm learning to cut back on it, though I haven't completely eradicated it.   I don't know about you, but for me, it definitely came from somewhere. My mom, and to a lesser degree, my dad, criticize a lot. As a kid, nothing I did was good enough and there was a good chance that if I made a mistake, I was going to be shouted at or told that I was stupid or treated like a huge, inconvenient disappointment.   For me, a big part of it has been addressing that. First, I tried getting my parents to quit criticizing me. When that didn't work, I stopped talking to them. I may try again later, but right now, I'm not at a place in my life where I can handle having to weed critical voices out of my head again for days every time I talk to them.   After cutting them off, I've practiced talking to myself more kindly and realistically. Did I make a mistake by doing X? Yes. But you know what, other people make that mistake all the time. It's okay to make mistakes. I'll try to do better next time. When I'm modeling my friends' voices, I try to focus hard on our history. Have they ever shouted at me or called me stupid? No? Then that is not an accurate model of them. I try to think of the kinds of things they have actually said to me, instead. And if those things are not kind or understanding, I begin by reminding myself that no one is perfect and probably, if they really understood my situation, they wouldn't have said that. If, however, there is a pattern of unnecessarily critical, harsh conversation from them, I re-evaluate our friendship.   Life is hard. We don't have to choose to friends who will make it harder. You're a good person. Most other people are, too, and most of them are going to treat you kindly most of the time.   I'm sorry that you're in a place where you're considering suicide. I've been there, and it hurts. It can get better, though. It may take a lot of work and time, but it can get better. If possible, get help from a doctor and a good therapist. And no matter what anyone else says or thinks, be kind to yourself. You know who you really are; if others don't understand, that's their problem. Just do the best you can and be proud of what you accomplish."

I graduated from college a decade ago, have had several great jobs, and I still feel the crippling fear of failure.   I'm taking an online class right now through Coursera and when I don't get a perfect score on the quizzes or assignments, I really put myself down. I obsess endlessly about how I can get a perfect score, and now I've fallen behind.   You can do this. I've survived it for 10 years despite the constant fear of failure.   Some days are harder than others, for sure.   I also have the guilt when I'm not working. I fear that my skills will get stagnant if I'm not constantly studying and practicing. I haven't yet figured how to get past that. But I hardly ever play video games or watch Netflix anymore, even though I love doing those things. It's all the fear of falling behind."
Anxiety,3dwm9l,The_Talisman,3,Mon Jul 20 03:57:52 2015 UTC,"I think making a timetable for your week would make you feel like your time wasn't wasted. I do this around exam periods when I want to study but realise I need to have some social time too. Leave a couple days blank (maybe the weekend or mine used to be Wednesdays and Sundays) so you can see friends and chill. For your other days pick a ""stopping time"" and make sure you stick to it. If you say your not gonna study past 8pm, then don't!   Try speaking to people on your course and see how much time they spend studying and how often they go out. It might make you feel better to do similar amounts as your peers."

You need to balance the two and rekindle your passion for your studies. If not maybe consider taking a break and getiing into a job first before continuing on the same path.

That's a lot of pressure and it doesn't leave much room for you to make mistakes. Maybe take a step back and try not to think about grades too much. Focus more on doing your best, at the end of the day that's all you can do. Worrying is just a waste of time in your case because it just causes you anxiety."

Thankfully I have a very ample stash of yarn so its not costing me much at all. (It would cost me nothing if I would stop seeing yarn that I just 'must have' and buying it. I'm sticking with my own stuff until I sell something.)  Less than $10 could get you knitting if you want to stop the hand tapping. Its more socially accepted and its kind of a mood boost. (supposedly knitting has a mildy sedative/antianxiety effect. I can believe it. I'd love to start a yarn crafting anxiety group thing, if I could help a few people I might be less critical of myself.)"
Anxiety,3dw39v,UndeadKitten,2,Mon Jul 20 01:26:58 2015 UTC,"Me too! I just started a few months ago. Unfortunately I don't have a stash yet, so I have to keep buying yarn.

Anxiety,3dwxst,do_a_flip,2,Tue Jul 21 04:26:16 2015 UTC,"Honestly, don't wait to get approached.  The guys who do chat up girls in bars are   1.) Looking to hook up  2.) Always the douchiest guys with the biggest ego.  Don't you think a smart but shy guy has similar issues to you? Not wanting to be rejected, being self-aware, he's unlikely to make the first step. By the time he makes a move, 5 douches who don't give a fuck about the girl he's interested in will already have hit on her, just to see that they can.  Just try to make a move, don't hunger for attention from anyone, you pick who you want.  EDIT: Even if you're just looking to hook up, waking up next to a douche is worse for your ego than not getting laid at all."

I think maybe it has to do with two main things; 1) people asking for thing's I don't think I can give (I have the worst impostor syndrome-type issues ever), combined with the fact that people can reach me any time, any where. That might be why I prefer face-to-face; odd as it sounds, when you are talking to someone face to face, you can control it a bit more. You have more feedback to work with (body language, tone, etc), and you also can get up and leave if you have to. But with the phone/internet, that ability to be free is lesser. If that makes sense?"
Anxiety,3dw9qu,anxiouslycute24,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:22:56 2015 UTC,"Yea I get super anxious checking my phone , email etc especially when im not getting along with someone or im simply just waiting for somebody to contact me Ugh then I get super nervous checking it ..."
Anxiety,3dw9qu,roosterrugburn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:30:16 2015 UTC,"Not getting along with someone makes it so much worse, because you are just waiting for a bad message to come through. By chance, have you ever experienced any form of online/cyber bullying? I have, which I think might be a part of it... its like I'm just waiting for that next mean message"
Anxiety,3dw9qu,roosterrugburn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:25:37 2015 UTC,"No I haven't experienced any cyber bullying , I try to avoid situations online if I feel I could potentially end up being harassed (like giving my opinion on contraversial topics) lol I try to avoid those because although the person has no idea who I am and vice versa SOMEHOW mean comments still get me all anxious and worked up! But yes waiting on replies from a person Im not getting along with is like waiting on death row ugh I sit waiting for the email/text and when it comes I peak and kinda skim the first line to see if its gonna be super upsetting, then I get tingly armpits (YAY ME) ugh do you ever get tingly arm pits when your anxious @SidonaKnight"

Anxiety,3dwun8,meow_4145,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:58:39 2015 UTC,"Let's see...  Maybe you heard about this silly trick, but if you imagine the person you are talking to is in his/hers underwears, it will give you some safety cuz.  I mean, you are not so bad in a situation like this right? Well this worked to me because I constantly needed to do presentations in front of everyone in my class, and this trick made me feel less tense.  Hang out with people you are only comfortable with. If you can't, use that trick and empty your mind, like completely, and just focus on the person you are talking to, that should help you avoid bad thougts.  Try to think good things, force it even, and eventually you will become more used to the idea. Also you could use some logic, if you have a bad thought or feeling, come with an explanation why it doesn't make a lot of sense why that would happen.  Really hope it helps."
Anxiety,3dwun8,FoxOperator,2,Mon Jul 20 05:18:43 2015 UTC,"I knocked out all classes my first year of college that I had to do presentations for, or so I thought...now it's me presenting my pieces to the class. Not many words but it still feels like I am in the spot light but I feel like the positive thought process could really help in this situation too. I've always tried in the past to let my mind wander in social situations, like just zoning out completely, and it does not always work and when it does I tend to miss important things. I will deff try this and the logical thoughts too. I appreciate you advising me to hang out with people I only feel comfortable with too. In the past I've been told I needed to ""branch out"" and make new friends but thats so hard for me when I have a perfectly nice group already around me that I feel like I can talk to but I do try and I am nice to everyone. I really appreciate your advice! Thank you! :)"
Anxiety,3dwun8,trash_the_past,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:50:57 2015 UTC,"It's going to be okay. So, as far as having to talk to people for work goes, when I have to do something stressful, I try to either 1-eliminate the stressful thing or 2-give myself a good break afterward to recharge.   I understand not liking to look at yourself in the mirror. I've never loved looking at myself and it's only gotten worse with time, as I've stress-eaten more and more. I tend to think people who are nice to me are making fun of me or want something from me. But in the last couple of years, I've been fortunate to run into people who've made me understand that there are solid people out there who really value me, no matter what I look like. And even better, there are people out there who enjoy what I look like, right now, even though I don't love my looks. You can find these people, too. It takes some work to weed out the others, but you're okay just the way you are. When you let yourself really know that, it'll be easier to wait for the people who really value you and to believe them when they're around.  I've got a touch of OCD, myself. Not so much with lining/coordinating things (at least, not outside of my closet). But I wash my hands constantly and often for no reason, just kind of on autopilot. I may try to work out of it later, but as I'm currently dealing with other stressful things, I've decided to let myself have that for now and just compensate by using gentle soaps and lots of lotion. If you want to work on overcoming it, you can do it. But if you want to let it be, that's okay, too.   It sounds like you already recognize things that help soothe you and are good at incorporating them in your life. Well done! It takes some of us longer to get there. : )   So, as for the worrying about future events, I do that, too. (And past events, and never-going-to-happen events. It's what I do.) Something I've been trying lately is to first, envision exactly how bad the thing I'm afraid of is likely to go. If it's probable that it will really be shitty, I let myself off the hook and don't do it (for instance, I no longer speak to my mother, because she can't go five minutes without criticizing my lifestyle, religious choices, weight, etc.). However, if, as is often the case, the worst-case scenario is just that I'll feel awkward for a bit and maybe the other people will, too, I make plans to help with that. For me, if I can have something to do with my hands, I don't feel as stressed. So I drag knitting or crochet along with me a lot, or I have a piece of paper I can doodle on or write notes to myself in a language no one else is likely to understand. Or I tell myself I can leave after thirty minutes, or take frequent bathroom breaks. Perhaps you can think of something that can help you feel less uncomfortable. Also, being alone doesn't have to be inherently awkward. I'm finding that if you just own it and don't worry about what other people are thinking, it can be quite comfortable. You can enjoy people watching, plan your week, or look around for someone else who looks awkward and go befriend them. (That's one of my favorite ways to stop feeling uncomfortable. If I find someone who is much more awkward than I am, I suddenly feel all suave and good at being friendly.)  I'm sure you've already noticed this, but I'm finding that people don't think of me as awkward or weird or whatever unless I act like I'm uncomfortable with myself. So if I can just pretend to be confident for a while, it becomes easier to do it more. People usually aren't as critical as we imagine them to be and will generally just accept as we are, as long as we accept ourselves.  Good luck with things. If you'd ever like to chat, feel free to PM me. I enjoy meeting new people, and I'm always down for swapping techniques for handling anxiety. : )"
Anxiety,3dws0n,Callofboobies,2,Mon Jul 20 04:31:17 2015 UTC,"Hi,  Yes, i went to one for social anxiety.   we went for a meal in some BBQ place in Dublin, in temple bar of all places ! (a place thats full of big crowded pubs, restaurants, there's even people all over the street )   anyway it did't go as bad as i thought, there where members of the group who've been doing these types of meetups for years and a few newbies like myself   we basically sat there, made small talk and had food (makes sense when you think about it ! )  to be honest it was a little bit uncomfortable, but not bad for a first try   looking back i think i could have made it easier for myself  (as in not putting too much pressure on myself, as everybody else in the group are there for the exact same reasons, they of all people understand where you're coming from )"
Anxiety,3dwqpu,Stundesagte,2,Mon Jul 20 04:17:48 2015 UTC,"Hi! I just wanted to reassure you that sometimes friendships just fizzle out, there doesn't always have to be a reason for them ending! Sometimes you can talk to someone everyday and be best friends, and then only speak every second day, then every third... And there isn't a definite reason. You've just outgrew each others company. I changed friend groups a lot throughout my childhood and ""lost"" bestfriends quite a lot. Although looking back on it, I realise that we didn't have a lot in common or just didn't have time to hang out and stuff.   For me at least, when I have anxiety about an issue, my anxiety will often try and find other issues that were similar to try and make the original issue seem bigger than it is. I think that's what's happening with you noticing your friends. You noticed one person you used to be close to and now your anxiety is trying to make you believe that everyone you've lost touch with is because of the same reason. Hopefully that makes sense!"

Anxiety,3dunth,tossout8005,9,Sun Jul 19 17:24:03 2015 UTC,"Hey, man! I read every last line of your post.   I'm going to be honest, I don't have it as bad as you, but a lot of what I'm reading is very similar to myself. I have generalized anxiety disorder. I'm anxious all the time, and I'm not exactly sure why. The worst part is the physical sensations brought on by my bad thought processes. This isn't about me, though, this is about you.  The one thing I couldn't help thinking while reading this post is just how negative everything is. I know it sounds simple, but you are speaking to yourself negatively all the time. You have said the word ""can't"" 8 times in your post. You should throw that word our the door. You've probably heard it so many times, but you have to be positive. Force yourself to smile, even.  Dude, you HAVE to get out of bed. By sitting there, you are giving your mind time to think. What happens when we give ourselves time to think? We start creating the worst kind of stories and you create a fear-adrenaline-fear cycle. You are fearful of something, adrenaline rushes in, so you become fearful of some sensation. The vicious cycle, as they call it.  You have to get out of bed and do something. Crawl if you must, but get moving NOW. There are no excuses for not moving. If you have a pair of shoes, go for a walk. Breathe slowly, and deeply. Tell yourself that you are going to destroy this ailment that has been holding you back. Again, be positive. Practice ""tactical breathing"".   A lot of the stuff you talk about is in the past, so let it be in the past. It is time to move forward - TODAY. Today is the day where you take control if this ailment. You are letting it get the best of you, but it's time to get angry towards those negative feelings.   You wrote an awfully thorough post, I can tell you are a very intelligent person. I can tell you the same effort that it took you to muster up the courage to write this post, you could be getting out of bed and taking baby steps to bettering yourself.  I know life sucks right now for you, but it is the only thing you have. The alternative is not nearly as fun as living.   So again, GET OUT OF BED AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT! YOU GOT THIS!  Lastly, there is an AWESOME book I recommend that has been a god send for me - Hope & Help for your Nerves by Dr. Claire Weekes -  http://www.amazon.com/Hope-Help-Nerves-Claire-Weekes/dp/0451167228  I read a review of the book on Amazon which sit all too closely with me. Please read this book review -   http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C03EID87KV3K/ref=cm_cr_dp_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451167228&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books#wasThisHelpful"
Anxiety,3dunth,therealjgreens,4,Sun Jul 19 17:44:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why your response has me all upset, but maybe it's just because someone heard me and made an effort. I don't get that much - lol. I appreciate it. I've read your reply twice and I have no defenses for the things you said. A part of it I think is that I have no other voice but my own - nobody to check-in with and no one to say, ""it's not so bad"". Until my brother's visit, the only human connection I've made in two months is the cashier at the grocery store. I'm a ghost. I've conditioned my mother and brother to know that I won't speak on the phone. Clever, really, because this lets me control what they know. There is no inflection in email, and I can take my time to make it seem things are alright.  I study all day long. On everything. I write. I frequent suicide prevention subs to offer compassion to those who feel they're at the end, only because I know what it feels like and I don't want them to feel that way. I've helped a couple of folks, or at least that's what they've said. I'm talented with photo restoration, and I've made a lot of people happy by giving them back some memories. I try really hard to count and I do it because I want to, and because I want to make people happy, if I can. I'm not a monster or a freak. I'm just me. And I'm really tired.  I have heard you when you suggest that I get out of bed and do something. For a brief moment, I saw myself at the beach (not far from here) for a stroll. The trouble is that I feel so alone in public.  I'm not going to rebuke the things you've said or find excuses for dismissing it. That's dirty pool, and besides, I know that you're right. I KNOW that you're right. I just feel too far gone now and I really don't have the interest in saving myself anymore. I don't see the point. Still... you've taken the time to try to help me see things clearer, and I should heed your words, to the best of my ability. There's a little pond across the way from my house and I'm going to grab a soda from the fridge and yesterdays bread and I'll go feed ""the girls"" (we have Sandhill Cranes, I call them ""the girls""). Maybe I'll feel better. If I do, I'll do it again.  Thanks doesn't cut it."
Anxiety,3dunth,therealjgreens,5,Sun Jul 19 18:29:21 2015 UTC,"Hey again. I think you're right in that you are only hearing your voice, because you are inside your own head 24/7. Yes, even when you sleep, and you know. The subconscious mind can be crazy. It's okay to get emotional. I do it all the damn time, and I'd consider myself a manly man.  That's awesome to hear that you help others, and it sounds like you are a completely selfless person. Unfortunately, because you do it from a keyboard, you are anonymous, but you are helping others, and that is so much more than anybody else does. Some people like shouting from the heavens how they help people, but that doesn't seem selfless. Most people have ulterior motives, you don't, and you should seriously applaud yourself for that.  It sounds like you really enjoy helping others, but the problem is that you don't seem to be helping yourself. The phone conditioning you referenced seems so normal for anxiety sufferers. We try and stay in our comfort zone all the time, and that's part of the problem. We make it seems to others that everything is normal, when it really isn't. I'd be 100% honest with your mother and brother. I know I am with my family, and they understand me (for the most part).  I'm sitting in my apartment, and part of me feels like I just want to stay here all day. I was in bed earlier having difficulty getting up, but I got up, threw some positive music on, and am taking care of stuff.  Stop convincing yourself that you are too far gone. That simply is not the case. You don't have cancer, you don't have some crazy physical ailment (from what I understand). It seems like you can do stuff, and you must!  Sorry if this next part sounds bad, but I'd avoid soda. I enjoy the hell out of soda, but it contains sugar and caffeine, which are both horrible for anxiety. I know this is sweating the small stuff, but you have to start small, otherwise the task will seem to tall. Drink water, and lots of it!  I guarantee you will feel at least a little better, but I'd try and fit in brisk walking, or something to get your heart pumping. The goal for you should be to get the endorphins flowing. They create the happy thoughts and calmness in our bodies.   Honestly, you don't even have to go outside to create some endorphins. You can start by doing simple things like planks, or pushups. There are absolutely moderations for these exercises to make them do-able for everyone.  There is a 7 minute exercise that is proven to help those with some sort of mental anguish -   http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout/?_r=0  The more tools, the better, right?  I know I'm just some stranger on an internet forum, but I hope you take some of this stuff to heart. Just like you, I enjoy helping others, and want to know that they are taking it to heart.  My buddy always said ""don't talk about it, be about it"". He's not the best ""practicer"" of the saying, but holy shit, does it resound heavily.  One other thing, /r/anxiety does offer a chat room. When I feel particularly bad, I go there. It's a great place to chat with other likeminded people."
Anxiety,3dunth,therealjgreens,4,Sun Jul 19 18:41:34 2015 UTC,"I'm back and a funny thing happened.  I sat at the bench (actually a tree stump) to feed the birds (these are huge birds) and sure enough they were strolling along the pond.  I tossed a rind of bread at the first one and she took it, shook her head and it flew right back in my face.  Now, see, someone else in my condition might say, ""even the bird rejects me""... lol.  I laughed my ass off - I thought it was hysterical.  I called her a bitch and thew it back.  I'm glad I went outside, even for a few minutes.  I feel a little better.  I am taking what you're saying to heart.  I don't want to be a burden, so if you'd rather not have a back and forth, that's very understandable.  You seem wise on the subject, and I was hoping to ask/share a point or two.  First, it's kinda funny about the soda.  I actually lied there, but only because saying ""I grabbed a seltzer"" sounded weird.  I only drink soda water or seltzer or sparking water - whatever it's called.  You said something that clicked.  Here's the thing... I've put plans together before; plans to get through this hell I'm currently living.  The first step is always to somehow stop feeling that death is imminent.  That is the most crippling part of the problem because I truly believe it.  But I also know that my mind lies to me.  Have you had experience with this?  You said that I can do things, that I wasn't dying and that was like a song to me.  A validation through that negative wall that maybe it's true.  The exercise thing scares me because if I exert myself, I'll die.  I'm telling you, it's bad - I'm clinical at this point.  My head is not right with this and it's likely the greatest issue I have.  It keeps me from doing anything.  I can't regulate heat, I overheat - sweat - if I do anything at all and my mind tells me that this means I'm about to die.  I can't hear anything health-related.  My brother prattled on about his blood work and all that he's doing to get his levels in check and that goes into my brain and explodes.  I'm a hypochondriac.  And part of what keeps me from relaxing in social settings is that someone is going to start talking about health issues, because my mind will assume the issues and torture me.  See, the thing is, if I believed that I wasn't dying right now (I believe I'm actively dying as I write this), I would want to fight.  I don't have that now, which is why I want to die - or I should say ""take control of my death"".  I know that there's something inside me that wants to live.  I've had amazing comebacks in my lifetime, and I know that the fight is still there somewhere.  Have you ever had this sort of fear before, as it relates to anxiety?  I know it's real (meaning anxiety produced) but I've been fighting this so long that I've lost the coping skills necessary to hold it back.  If I can hear that this is common, I can use it - like a tool.  ""This is not real, this is just your anxiety"".  If that gets me around the block and I live, that's more proof upon which to build a case against the lies in my mind.  Does that make any sense?  I think I sound crazy and maybe I am.  But this is nothing but pure honesty pouring out and I've never done that before.  Not even with my therapist - I avoided this part.    I hope I'm not being a pest.  You've been really awesome and really helpful."
Anxiety,3dunth,thechristinechapel,6,Sun Jul 19 19:31:38 2015 UTC,"Good on you for going out there. That is the crawl part of the crawl/walk/run approach. Are you telling me if you picked up your pace a little bit in getting out there, or walked around a little more, you would die? That is exactly how an anxious person thinks.  Funny little story about the bird. You're right in some people would take the bird's response as a trigger, good thing you can laugh that stuff off. My sister had such a bad anxiety episode over the course of several months, and things like that would throw her into a tailspin. She thought people were talking about her all the time. Every single thing would trigger her anxiety. She actually started taking a pill recently, and she swears by it. I can't even explain how much that pill has helped her, but in the same vein, I don't know how keen I am on depending on a pill for the foreseeable future.  Have you tried taking something before?   I've put plans together before; plans to get through this hell I'm currently living. The first step is always to somehow stop feeling that death is imminent. That is the most crippling part of the problem because I truly believe it. But I also know that my mind lies to me. Have you had experience with this?   Yep, absolutely. Before I understood what was going on with my anxiety, and physical symptoms. I thought something was seriously wrong with me. I felt a large knot at the base of my skull, and got fixated with it. I decided to see the nurse, and she told me nothing was wrong with me after doing tests. I didn't believe her, so I just lived with this idea that something was seriously wrong with me.  I learned more and more about anxiety. There was a point where I was just fed up with feeling ill all the time, so I made some life changes. I decided to make sure exercise was the first thing I did each day (had to start small). There were many times where I thought my heart was going to explode, especially when I was running. It never did. I can't tell you how many times I thought I was going to have a hear attack.  I remember pulling my shirt up one time, and showing a friend my heart beat because I could see it beating basically in my stomach area. He has a medical background, and he laughed at me. Probably not the best response, but I think it is what I needed.  I still get physical sensations all the time, but I know it is just my anxiety rearing it's ugly head.  Not to keep name dropping it, but that book I linked you probably has been the best source of information for me. If you have trouble purchasing, I'd be happy to help out. Best $5 I have ever spent.   I'm a hypochondriac   This is a consistent issue with anxiety sufferers. Are you heavy set? What about exercising makes you think it is going to kill you?   I can be very sensitive on the subject of death (because I've experienced it at a very young age), but would you rather sit around and wait for death to come, or do something about it? The latter sounds so much more palatable to me.    Have you ever had this sort of fear before, as it relates to anxiety?   Yes. I know exactly how you feel. The feeling of hopelessness is fuckin' real, but you have to train your mind to not think this way.  I just got back from a trip to Oregon. It was a work trip, but I had a high level of anxiety for the entire trip. From the plane ride out there, to doing some basic hiking, to even eating food there - everything caused anxiety. I even saw a HORRIBLE car crash while out there, which kind of messed me up a little.   I know that the entire time, my mind was playing tricks on me. I know nothing is wrong with me (other than terrible anxious thoughts), and I needed to relax, but it was very difficult because I had all these tasks weighing on me.   On the surface, I look normal, even relaxed, but inside, there are times when I seriously feel like I'm dying. Holding these feelings in are not good for you.  And, no, you are not a burden. This is actually helping me because of my own anxiety, so it helps me to help others (just like you!)"
Anxiety,3dunth,PriceZombie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:41:15 2015 UTC,"Another hypochondriac here checking in. I spent most of my childhood periodically believing I was sick or going to die for one reason or another. My mom called it my ""fears"" but no one understood that it was clinical anxiety. In between doing normal kid stuff I obsessed over my health and would sporadically feel a sense of doom overwhelm me where I knew it was all over and I would die soon. In college I called my mom and told her that the ""fears"" we're back. This time including depression and social anxiety. After a few years of dealing with that crap again I was lucky enough to get help. I guess I'm telling you all this just so you'll know you're absolutely not alone, and you never will be alone. Even when your brain tells you you are. Just try and remember that when you feel alone and outside of yourself and outside of everything. Repeat the words to yourself. Your brain won't believe you at first but it will start to after awhile."

Anxiety,3dunth,unicorn_waffles,4,Sun Jul 19 19:33:06 2015 UTC,"Going through a similar thing as you at the moment. I LITERALLY didn't leave my bed for TWO years because I was so damn tired of the world. Just so so tired. Like you, I had no friends and only a few family members who didn't completely understand what was going on. I knew that I needed to stop and get out of bed but I just didn't care. I was actually happy with staying in my room all day and couldn't fathom leaving it and thinking about the future.   I am just going to say that this feeling that you are having is NOT permanent. You might not believe me because I didn't either. It might feel like there are too many lies, and failures and obstacles in the way that you will never overcome. That everything is just too far gone and you are in too deep to even see a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel. And yah, it might take years before you see that light again but try leaving your bed today and take a walk. Just a walk. You don't have to talk to anyone or go anywhere in particular. Just walk for a little bit. Don't pressure yourself too much about it. You can even just walk around your house.

And you're very right - it's extremely hard to see a light right now, and harder still to believe it's possible.  I posted this thinking it would be ignored.  I even braced for sarcastic comments, but I was really surprised by the kindness offered to me by strangers.  And I've been reading each post over again.  I did get out today, after receiving some strong words here.  I got dressed and went to the pond across the way to feed the birds.  I wrote to an earlier responder to my post how one of the birds threw the bread back at me and I laughed.  Maybe I should take it as a sign - I mean a good one.    I'm not ""all better"", God knows, but folks like you have brightened my day enough to where it's eased the hard edge of a very bad time.  I'm hopeful that I can take it further.   Thank you again."
Anxiety,3dunth,BlackMarketClash,2,Sun Jul 19 20:44:32 2015 UTC,"Hey that's great that you went to the pond today. I know how hard that must of been mentally and physically. Realize that you made a great first step today and hold on to that feeling of success.   And if you are having an extra hard day tomorrow, go for a walk again and just take deep breaths. Be in the present. A phrase that I repeat to myself when I am feeling particularly anxious is ""I am not my past, I am not my future, I am my present."" It helps me to not dwell on my past mistakes and my unknown future. Just thought I should throw that out there, just in case it helps.   If you feel comfortable enough, try speaking to your brother about everything. It always helps to have someone know what you're going through even if they can't help you directly. I hope you have a good rest of the day, and if you don't, just keep going. Know that you are not alone and that you have people rooting for you."

I can't explain how tired I am.  I was recently offered a free trip to my favorite place on earth, and I wanted to go, but I knew I couldn't, so I didn't.  The trouble is that so much of this is in my mind.  I know that's true, but the lies anxiety tells are so convincing that you stop taking chances.  The first reply was wonderful, I agree.  And I told them that I'm going to take a small step out of the house today.  I'll think of this kindness when I do and I'll hope that it'll help a little.  I won't go for long, just a few minutes, but that's more than I've done in some time.  Thank you so much."

This world and our brains are a scary place.  If you can find anything, I mean just the smallest something you like, the one thing that gives you any joy it's worth sticking around.  Hookers, booze, good drugs and sillyness are all worth doing before you punch your own ticket to no where land. It's not great advice, hell it's not even what most people want to hear.   But what I do know is that you are hear now. And if it's all over there is no more you, there is no relief cause you just cease to exist. You'll go out being anxiety ridden and found cold and dead with a load of shit in your pants.   So do anything, everything you want and make it better if you can. I know that I almost committed suicide twice, and where I am now I'd be so sorrowful for missing out and getting better.  Yes you can get better, you can get relief.  Its exhausting, hellish and a horrible way to live right now, but you are finding all the reasons to go and nothing to stay.  Hang in there. One is a permanent you are gone and never get better solution. The other, hell if playing a video game in the dark with a bottle of jack and jerking off is the highlight of your day it's still better than not being here.

Anxiety,3dw699,KalilReaper,3,Mon Jul 20 01:09:31 2015 UTC,"Have you been to a doctor for help?   I've had crippling anxiety for years, since childhood.  I only recently sought treatment after a somewhat serious meltdown and am currently trying Lexapro with Xanax for backup in case I have a panic episode.  If you're having suicidal feelings, and you haven't been to get professional help, it's time.   I, not surprisingly, had anxiety over talking to a doctor about it so I kept it quit let for years.  Letting go and getting help was a massive leap for me, but a necessary one.  I see now how much my anxiety affected me before, the denial was pretty thick.     If you are working with a doctor and you are still having issues like this, you need to make another appointment to let them know your current plan isn't working.  If they are resistant to other treatment plans, switch doctors.  You don't have to live your life like this."

A saying in sports is ""don't play not to lose"". It looks that you are fighting to miss a failure. Why not fight to succeed? Try morphing your thoughts to this... your work shouldn't be avoiding failure but only to succeed. If you can throw that wrench in to your thought process it may help.

Anxiety,3dtz18,moggymojo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:22:05 2015 UTC,"Anxiety and fear are time coded differently (as are lots of other things). So essentially fear is an in the moment response to something actual that is happening in real time, where as anxiety is about anticipating something that you expect to happen.  I have noticed that I deal with actual emergencies pretty damn well, but I work myself into fits over 'little things' because I am trying to plan in advance my responses to every possible scenario.  More powerful in your hometown? - here I am guessing but I think it would be a combination of concern over knowing the other driver (increased embarrassment/awkwardness), and layers of similar experiences contributing to a heightened response - after all the trip had been going on for hours at that point with you anticipating this need the whole time."

Younger me is straight up a recluse who would stay inside and write all weekend while all my friends were out at a pool party.   If there are more than 2 fonts on ANY document or design, my consistency buzzer goes off and I freak out about it all day.   If I'm not driving, I pretty much just close my eyes for the entire trip because I trust no one else.   I have always thought about what would happen if there was a crazy emergency, even going so far as what about if my father died, to get out of work, and when my uncle had a heart attack thought, ""Is this enough to skip work today?""  Perfectionism? Jesus. I work in media and film, and this is both the best thing about me and the worst, because I will spend way too long working on things that I deem inadequate.

It seems like you find social situations stressful but they don't necessarily make you anxious.  You don't seem to crave friendship and being put in social situations might make you feel alienated because you don't have a purpose for being there, the reason you find your mom irritable is probably because she asks predictable questions and you might not like her ""checking up on you"".  You may have a fear or be irritated by people judging you and that's how the car crash, job anxiety and perfectionist thing are related.   Feel free to tell me if I  completely wrong"
Anxiety,3duw2k,I_Am_So_So_So_Sorry,7,Sun Jul 19 18:33:27 2015 UTC,I think every anxious person is at least occasionally tormented by memories of past misdeeds. I sure am.

Acknowledging that fact is a good step to recovering from mistakes. I wish I had the proper citations on me but from what I basically know is : it's highly likely that any negativity that could have been perceived by that community will likely be forgotten because the brain usually forgets painful or uncomfortable thoughts. To me, ""I said something terrible"" ""I'm sure at least one person felt offended"" all sounds like your ego trying to assert itself with certainty in an unknown situation. Again, I don't have proper link citations but I do have this from you, ""I can't remember any of the names of the people"" . Just consider, if YOU can't even remember their names why would they remember you? Just as you had moved on from that moment and forgotten those gaming users it is just as likely they have moved on, like you, and forgotten as well. ""GOOD NEWS EVERYONE!!""

Anxiety,3du9bb,boredandprone,3,Sun Jul 19 15:10:09 2015 UTC,"As far as the bus goes - even though you aren't close to home, try to remember that if you need to go and it can't wait until you are home, there are other stops that you can pop off and find a restroom.  It sucks to pay again, but you gotta do what you gotta do.  As for the lectures - I was always worried about leaving the class early/coming in late.  I started people watching when other students came in and left.  What I noticed was, unless the student exiting/entering made a big scene of it (being dramatic, making a lot of noise, yelling, etc) that a few other students might look up to see what the rustling is about/see if they need to move their things, but then go right back to listening to the teacher or taking notes.  Sitting near the door would likely be your best bet - get there early, take the seat closest to it.  Makes it easier to get out at the end of class, but also makes it easier popping out for a quick phone call, bathroom break, etc.  As for advice - I swear, half of my comments in this reddit include this suggestion, but it seriously did wonders for me - write yourself notes.  In the case of the lecture, it could be 'No one minds if I need to leave the room a few times as long as I am respectful about how I do it.'  For the bus, it could be 'Many businesses have restrooms I could use along the way if I need them.'  Just something you can look at when the anxiety and panic start."

""Well what if i gotta take a dump""   Its SO stupid but i got really worked up over that and my mind seemed to trick itself into thinking i actually had to shit when i didnt really have to. I scoped out everyone around me to see if there was a teacher or something that i could go to if i really had to go.  I never actually had to go haha, what i learned that day is to not worry about something unless it actually happens. That doesnt stop me from worrying about things, but its a helpful thing to think and supresses some anxiety when i get in situations like that.  Just know that every human has enough self control of their body to not waste themself unless there is some physical health problem and anxiety does many things, but losing control of your body is not one of them."
Anxiety,3du9bb,ifavorentropy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:59:57 2015 UTC,"I have the exact same issue. Beyond bimonthly therapy sessions, here's how I'm handling it:  LECTURE * Use the restroom before class, even if I don't have to.  * Sit in an aisle seat where I can leave unobstructed and quietly.  * Fully immerse myself in the material. I find I'm able to handle things a lot better if I'm not thinking about it.  * Avoid caffeine (diuretic) before longer classes like labs, and never without food in my tummy.   TRAVELING (this is my main issue given that I live in a city with few public restrooms) * Use the restroom before leaving on any part of the trip, even if I don't have to. (I'm working on not having to do this so I can move back towards normalcy, but it's great for coping.) * Stay near the door when possible  * Map out unfamiliar routes - where can I stop if I need to? Is there a fast food place or public area around? I try to make the intervals between these emergency rest spots no more than 20-30 minutes.  * Bring something to do to distract myself. Like I said, I don't panic about having to pee if I'm so engrossed in something that I don't realize I have to pee.  To get better and handle things better, I try to push my bounds on good days, when I'm less anxious, in situations where bathrooms are freely accessible. Sitting in my dorm room and have to pee? Wait half an hour to prove that I can. Feeling good about the trip I just took and have a few spare minutes? Walk around the block one more time instead of rushing for the bathroom. I can wait, I am in control of my body."
Anxiety,3dvabs,Apateona,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:34:13 2015 UTC,"I've never had a panic/fear reaction to music... but certain types of music can start to make me anxious.   A long time ago I read an article about people having a subliminal affinity for music that matches their heartbeat. Which makes sense... because dubstep/heavy rock seem to make me feel icky. I just assumed it was because it had a faster beat that mimics my heat beat patterns when I'm in a panic.   Now when I listen to music for pleasure (I work as a DJ so when I work I don't have a choice)  i tend to gravitate towards songs with a slower steady beat. Lots of blues... lots of folky/indy music. At night I will listen to classical (I have. Station on Pandora based on the song ""sometimes when it rains"" it's a smoother classical station that doesn't have a large amount of intense building or tempo variations)   I'm sorry I don't have more info to offer... but I hope this helps in some way. Best of luck."
Anxiety,3dvabs,queenlardass,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:16:30 2015 UTC,Try different types of music and see if that helps. What do you usually listen to and I'll help recommend songs different from those.
Anxiety,3dvabs,Music_Cannon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:21:54 2015 UTC,"As one who has a deep love for music, yet struggled with anxiety towards certain genres at different times, here is my experience. Music use to be a way to divert anxiety before I started making emotional connections with certain songs, artists, or genres that would rekindle moments of fear and panic. After a while, when a certain song would come on the radio or Pandora queue, I would experience that same level of anxiety as if I was reliving the moment. When this first started out, I couldn't put my finger on a specific event, but after forcing myself to listen through the song while reflecting on the overwhelming anxiety, I finally had a sense of what past events were triggering it. It took a bit of time to reintroduce the music back in, but it is possible. When this hit, the only genre of music I could stand to listen to was soundscapes. About three months in, I read an article about the history of musical tuning variations and I found it a tad interesting. There is a group of audiophiles that believe certain tuning ranges (I think 432Hz instead of 440Hz) have healing powers, personally I don't believe that, but I will say that listening to some of the songs that use to bother me in a different tuning (I used audacity to change the pitch) actually helped project a different mood on the song so that I could work through any anxiety and reintroduce it.  Also knowing that I can switch the music at any time has really helped. Through this whole experience, I stopped listening to the radio and now am exclusively using streaming sites that give me full control over the queue so I can make a change at any time. If you can group songs into playlists based on emotional responses, that might help as well.   Not sure if this is any help. Just thought I would throw my two cents in and share my experience."

Kudos to you for that.  I would generically suggest therapy to you since it sounds like it could be that you're getting anxious in certain conditions, and maybe it's just a matter of conditioning yourself to not have the feelings you have when you have them (I don't mean to make it sound that simple, it usually isn't and I don't want to belittle your issues). If this is all caused by your experiences overseas, it's something I would highly recommend seeking professional assistance in working past.  Are there other medications suggested that you could try? I've never been on anything too high a dosage and I never stuck to what I used to take some years back because it didn't do all too much, but maybe it's just a matter of being on something different."
Anxiety,3dw0rc,20catsinapersonsuit,2,Mon Jul 20 01:35:20 2015 UTC,Thanks for the response.   As far as what conditions make me anxious it seems to come on more when I become conscious of my dizziness/headache and tiredness.   I do have a psychiatrist that I speak with. She said that there are other options that we could try if need be. Hopefully being on something different will help. The only real things I need is to not be tired and dizzy. The rest I feel like I can deal with.
Anxiety,3dw0rc,20catsinapersonsuit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:02:27 2015 UTC,"If it helps, that's a super common anxiety symptom, feeling more anxious as you call attention to and become conscious of it. My therapist just told me how not experiencing the feeling for long enough can make you forget about it almost entirely. It'd go away and stay away. Problem is most people have problems keeping it away for more than a day or so depending on what it is/how bad it is."
Anxiety,3dw0rc,20catsinapersonsuit,2,Mon Jul 20 02:13:03 2015 UTC,Im hoping that once school starts I will be more preoccupied. As in the past I just havent had anything to do except sit at home and ... do nothing.
Anxiety,3duiyq,tealiteful,2,Sun Jul 19 16:41:22 2015 UTC,"Just off the top of my head thoughts, but the facts to me that front door usually kept locked and the one time a guest (you) left the door unlocked someone made an attempt may suggest that   burglar(s) had been waiting for an opportunity (I think mornings are ideal time. People busy to rush to work while others too tired to be paying attention to suspicious activity.)    OR   dumb desperate fool attempting their luck. (i've only known one character in my life who would have a hobby to try doors. He claimed to only look in and may only take, ""a bit of good stuff like change, gum"" if within arm's reach. He's an idiot but an example)   Guh, time to put down the reddit detective fedora. Anyway.  For my own panic attacks I resort to facts. We are human, and statistically will make mistakes. We often find ourselves struggling to be perfect (in our own minds) and showcase our mistakes while overlooking the benefits. As much as your ego wants to demand that you are responsible, in reality you are not just because you are a beautiful simple human and not a factory perfect machine. You may exclaim "" WHAT IF I put my family in danger???"" but my counter point ; ""what if you had locked the door and the burglar just come back another time, or go to another house?"" What if your simple mistake has now deter a criminal from your area? If your ego can grip onto the thought of your mistake then help your ego to grasp the idea of the benefits of your mistake.   The most positive thing to take from this whole ordeal may be this;  highly likely they won't try again now knowing residents will confront and property have police attention. No one was seriously injured and may help with home protection awareness for your parents' community. Best of luck with it all, it can be very very difficult but if you have made it this far in your life tealiteful I feel you can make it though this ordeal."
Anxiety,3duiyq,tadoke,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:44:42 2015 UTC,Thank you so much! My father was driving five minutes away to drop off my brother at work and the burglars' car passed his right as they were leaving so they've assumed that it was an opportunity crime. I'm really lucky that my mother was safe and that she was able to confront them without harm to herself. Thanks for your message - thinking about it through a more factual lens helped (and helps) a lot. Thank you again!
Anxiety,3duiyq,sigyn13,2,Sun Jul 19 20:01:47 2015 UTC,"Even if you left the door unlocked, its still not your fault that a burglar came in.   That person decided to attempt something they knew was wrong. You have no control over that. They might have broken a window if they hadn't found the door unlocked.   I know its hard to convince your brain these things at times but there's no use being hard on yourself. It seems like everything's alright now. It's not likely that they'll try your house in the future if they were chased off, either. Most burglars don't want to have to confront anyone. In the future I bet you won't forget again, either! Everything's going to be okay. :)"
Anxiety,3duiyq,VideoSpellen,3,Sun Jul 19 19:11:29 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for your words! I felt a lot better after reading your post and it was definitely comforting to think that it's not likely that they'll strike again. I really appreciate your comfort and positivity :) Thank you!
Anxiety,3dwmln,Kbook92,2,Mon Jul 20 03:37:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think so. A surrogate for this is to spend time with a pet. Petting a dog or cat or other furry animal produces similar feelings/chemicals and reduces anxiety."
Anxiety,3dwmln,soMuchToFind,2,Mon Jul 20 03:51:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks. My cat is pretty in-tune with my anxiety and depression. He's been snuggling with me a lot more than usual. (Not that I think he knows I need it but I think he worries about me and wants to stay close? I don't know. Animals know things. It's weird.) It's not the same snuggling with a cat, but it doesn't hurt either."
Anxiety,3dwmln,krafandiko,2,Mon Jul 20 04:10:32 2015 UTC,"Well I certainly know what you're talking about. Have you ever been held? I haven't, but as a kid I started using it as a fantasy whenever my anxiety got bad, or whenever I feel ill at ease.  I don't know, maybe kids with distant or absent parents do this and it is common. I think all anxiety starts in childhood and a lot of us come up with behaviors and fantasies to help keep ourselves as calm as possible.  There is something supremely safe about being in another's 'power'. Someone stronger than you is drawing you into their strength and letting you be all that you are, but in a place where no harm can come to you. And without even trying, all that tenseness and fear melts away.  Much harder to find this in the real world, where such a connection requires affection that a lot of us with anxiety live away from. A bit like wanting something you need, but living a life that makes it impossible to get. Nasty head trip."
Anxiety,3dvwwx,SingingSongs26,2,Sun Jul 19 23:46:06 2015 UTC,"I know how that feels where there's an ache in your heart so painful you'll do anything to make it stop because you can't stop thinking about them.  That feeling will be there for quite a while and the only things that will help are getting those feelings out of you, focusing on anything that will make you happy, and therapy.  If it has lasted this long and is this intense, it is best to seek additional help.  This is by no means calling you weak or saying you have to go this route, but I have been in your shoes and have had a friend that has been here as well and neither of us took this step and have had very negative consequences (suicide attempts, lost careers, etc.).  You may have co-dependent issues that can be explored and identified in therapy with someone you trust. Just some insight from someone that wishes someone had told me to go this route before my life had gotten too wrecked."

This whole relationship still weighing on my mind is now just another thing on the other things that worry me. But can be the worst one, It always seems to just remind of my loneliness and depression and bitterness that I never thought i had  . They live in a city, they can meet new people they relate too, explore themselves. I'm in an ignorant small town that I feel so isolated in from everyone. I went through such bitter envious times where I just wished I could be away from here. And hated them for the fact that they managed to and left me behind.  I wish I knew how to go about getting therapy. I think its covered by the NHS here but waiting lists are way too long. Any time I thought I'd see the doctor I'd get scared. I was so lucky to have friends that offered to accompany me but I never brought it up again. I'm always scared of whining or complaining or making what I have to be a bigger deal than it is.   thank you though, I need to do something. this on top of everything seems to be the biggest thing always holding me down. that just makes me sound sad."

I compare myself to my ex all the time and have realized that I have to stop doing that. He makes more money, has a nicer place and more friends and noticingthese things just brings me down now.  I had a life before him and was fine.  I can and will move on from this and need to focus on me.  It's not selfish to do so, but necessary or I will never be happy. Just know you're not alone or weak. It was your first relationship and, thus, your best SO FAR. Find that courage,  get focused on you, and get out there!"

I can say that weed can be targeted to help with anxiety or it can induce anxiety as I have seen this happen before. All in all, I would suggest that reaching out to others is a great start to trying to work through it. If you want to stop smoking you definitely can! But you need to find a support system to help you when you are feeling down. Post here, or find a friend that would be willing to chat with you when you are in a bad mood or feeling the need to smoke.  I cannot guarantee ceasing smoking will solve your anxiety, but it certainly can help you feel like you've accomplished so much."
Anxiety,3dvpu5,ImOnlyaMango,3,Sun Jul 19 22:45:02 2015 UTC,"It seems like your brain/mind is caught in a loop of cyclical thinking, which would make sense if you already suffer from anxiety/panic disorders and attacks. Being a girl with anxiety myself, I have had a small handful of pregnancy scares, and it's probably been the most pervasive type of paranoia I've found, at least for myself. Only one was a real scare, where I did the pregnancy test thing, and it seemed leading up to taking the test, babies/pregnant women/peggo-related services, anti abortion commercials, etc were everywhere. I was constantly seeing it & i was tormented thinking about it constantly and dreading the possibility. I'd try to get my mind off of it by distracting myself with tv or other things, and there would be a reminder of it. Have you taken a test or are you putting it off for the same reason i did (ie paralyzing fear)? If you do it it will get your mind out of this cycle & it's the only thing that will, until it becomes obvious whether you are or not. It sounds from you post that it would be highly unlikely you are, but on the very off chance you are you can at least start considering your options. Try to listen to the rational voice in your head as much as you can, remind yourself of all the reasons why you're having weird symptoms that are med-related and maybe even write it out if that sort of thing helps you (I've found it can be.) I wish you the best, and don't underestimate the power of breathing techniques & exercises!"

It was really awkward and scary, obviously when I finally took the test after a plane ride home (yeah not fun while super sick) it was negative. That day sucked so much it's when my anxiety really started haha  (And like the other person said exercise seems to help a lot with anxiety, same with meditation if I could actually get myself to do it regularly...)"

However, it isn't normal to dwell on it for long periods of time.  The irrational fears is absolutely a symptom of anxiety and it sounds like you could have generalized anxiety disorder or social anxiety. I urge you to talk to a doctor though, they are the only ones that will be able to give you a solid diagnosis and will be able to provide you with options to help cope with anxiety (therapy, medication etc.)"
Anxiety,3dwd0c,FishFollower74,2,Mon Jul 20 02:10:01 2015 UTC,"I have been there and I'm sorry you are having to experience it. I think there are multiple kinds of anxiety that people can deal with. Sometimes you can beat it and it goes away. Other times it's here to stay. That's not to say that you cannot handle them though.  I used to have some really bad health anxiety (my heart) and it was incredibly hard to get over. I'm not sure when it was, but all of the sudden it disappeared. I still have some minor annoyances with it but that's the way our brain works. We have a brain that is great at overworking a thought to something bigger than it should be. Just remember that with time, you can learn to cope with the attacks and put them at bay if need be. Never lose faith though that you can beat them."
Anxiety,3dwd0c,ndg2006,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:36:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the kind words, friend.  Yeah, my anxiety is of the heart kind as well. It went away for a while - not all of a sudden, but gradually until I was like ""Wow, haven't thought about it in a while."" It's tied to my weight - the more my weight goes up (and I'm not obese, just overweight...still...) the more I have the potential for anxiety.  Getting the PA yesterday just rattled my confidence, as I thought I was over these. Maybe not so much. But I will continue to do my best to win more than I lose in these battles.  Thanks again."

That being said, your prom could be better because it definitely isn't mine.  And who said you have to have a date to go? Anyone else's opinion in this regard should NOT matter.

I hope you know that there will be people in the same situation as you, and you are not alone.   Honestly, if it's making you feel this way, maybe it would be best not to go. Your mental health is so important so don't force yourself to do anything just to fit in if it will have a negative affect on you. If you want to go maybe ask a friend to ask someone for you? It might be a bit easier that way.   If you chose to go, I wish you luck and hope you have a great night.

I CAN guarantee you that you will not die or see any lasting harm from this incident. As you stated that your face does not hurt, which trust me it would if you were severely burned, then it is likely you only received a very minor burn at best. Do your best to remind yourself that you will in fact be okay. The only way to die from some kind of heat-related event would be to literally have your body destroyed from being burned to death, OR some kind of severe heat exhaustion - NEITHER of which is going to happen to you.

I feel like my heart is beating faster than usual, I'm nauseous, I have chest pain, I feel weak and clammy.  I have no appetite either.   I just have to keep reminding myself that all these symptoms are my anxiety symptoms, and that Im not about to kill over.  I don't know about you, but being around people makes me feel a lot better when I'm going through it. Sometimes its not enough and I'll have an ativan. (Lorazapam)  I hope you feel better man.

I skateboard every day and it's sort of my passion it makes me feel happy and calm, at night when I can't sleep I just go on reddit or watch YouTube. I also developed some bad habits like smoking cigarettes which I quit and started vaping. And dipping tobacco. I've always been too afraid to smoke weed.

It doesn't take the feelings away necessarily. .. but it dulls them.. and makes it easier to focus on other things (I usually watch youtube videos or check out the whoadude subreddit)   I don't know if that's a viable option for you.

I watch or listen to soothing t.v shows like Frasier or Bob Ross.  I play a video game, something emmerisve but also not to hard, just need to keep distracted.  Talking it out or writing in my journal.  Being around comforts, soft pillows, familiar old blanket and maybe try and sleep or nap.  Ride my bike or exercise to burn off the adrenaline.

You're not wrong for not wanting to go out to bars or clubs. I can't stand that scene.

Extroverts recharge by ""going out"" and being among people. Introverts recharge by being alone or in a small group/with their SO. You are an introvert. Unfortunately, the nature of American culture is to glorify extroversion. (Sorry if you're not American - I know I'm making an assumption here.)"

If so, take her statement at face value - she said you are the only one she's gone out with, so there is no one else.

I'm constantly worried about causing  harm to others but I'm learning to trust myself. I follow all the rules and am constantly alert when I drive so if anything did happen, it wouldn't be on me. Talking to a therapist has helped me realize I can only control my actions, so as long as I act properly there is nothing I could do to cause harm."

I would suggest finding a driving school and seeing if they offer personal driving instructions. It can be costly $60 - $75 an hour. See if you can meet with the instructor beforehand to talk about your anxiety about driving and make sure they're understanding and kind.  A lot of driving schools offer drivers ed classes for adults, but I find it's less nerve-wracking when it's just me and an instructor."

Anxiety,3dv00a,betterbananas,2,Sun Jul 19 19:06:54 2015 UTC,"Alcohol works on the GABA-ergic systems in the way it lowers anxiety and inhibition. If you find alcohol works for you, you may have some success using Lyrica or Neurontin; they are theorized to interact with the GABA-ergic systems and work as an anxiolytic. I've personally had success with them but short-term memory loss is a definite side-effect. It's impairing physically like alcohol but mentally you're still pretty sharp. Give them a try."

Anxiety,3du21r,nobdysjgsrbigrtnanet,3,Sun Jul 19 13:49:37 2015 UTC,"It's good that you made the step to get help, that's a huge step.  Don't worry about an Ativan overdose, benzos have an extremely good safety profile. Problems usually only arise when combined with alcohol or opiates. If you take too much you will probably just experience some amnesia but your dose is so low that you would need to take your dose multiple times at once to experience this.  The best thing you can do for yourself is not let avoidance turn into a habit, then the problem gets harder to deal with. Keep working with your therapist and you'll keep making progress, it just takes time. You've been dealing with everything perfectly so far. The dreams are all stress related, but they are just dreams.   Maybe you need an adjunct medication that is always in your system like an antidepressant or pregabalin if you feel you would benefit from it.  Best of luck!"

Anxiety,3dtcni,Omholt,3,Sun Jul 19 08:18:13 2015 UTC,"I felt if I stayed there one minute longer I was going to just have a nervous breakdown of my own. My left eye literally developed a twitch to it while each crawling second passed and my breathing was being blocked by all the saliva building in my throat. And even though my eyes were glued on the screen trying to feign oblivion to the people around me, I just had this thousand-yard stare  looking through the screen that you'd see in PTSD victims revisiting their past. Its a familiar feeling I try to avoid and yes, it occurs in social situations.  If you want to get deeper into how fucked up my life's become you can read my other thread I submitted here a few days ago. You might get a clearer picture of what my thought-process is. And my thought-process is even though it is certainly a form of social anxiety, the issues underlying it aren't in my head, but with my surrounding environment where I'm trying to learn to cope with.   People think I'm pretty ugly.   Not ugly where I have a big nose or asymmetrical features, and not unsightly as a burn victim needing a veil, somewhere in between. A sort of purgatory where my ugliness isn't something that I can just put behind me in life (its changed my life completely) and although bad, not bad enough to warrant any sort of sympathy from the general public where I could go on a day time talk show to talk about my strength or commoditize it with a published self-help book, although plenty of grimacing will be had on almost any person I make eye contact with. Those familiar eyes a person might only offer to a ghost. I deal with it everyday, and its left me a shut-in as it has for all the ugly people like me.  I didn't go into the coffee shop thinking maybe its all in my head, I know too much the expected reactions I'll receive anywhere I go. I went hoping that for maybe just a few hours I could learn to disregard my ugliness for a bit around other people, but they keep reminding me. Its a battle. The goal has never been to normalize and assimilate, that'll never happen this lifetime. The goal is to be zen and not give a fuck when a person gives me back my change at the register with shaky hands trying to not look at me. But Im only human. I like to pretend Im not a pussy about this stuff, but it tears my soul apart.   I think the only reason im doing these test runs at coffee shops is because I met a girl (who only knows me at the surface level, and is in for a fun awakening about my daily life), but Im trying to see how to gauge my mind because when I inevitably have to go out in public with her shes going to see the shitshow first hand."

Anxiety,3du057,ruffykunn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:36:38 2015 UTC,"Last year I was in a psychiatric hospital for several weeks (major anxiety and depression). The first two medications they tried did nothing, which really sucked. Then they gave me a benzo which worked immediately but could only be safely administered short-term until they found some safe long term medication.  Which they ultimately did, two mediations combined with one of the two that originally did nothing on their own was the mix that ended up working well for me and still does a year later :).  Other patients there had stuff work immediately. Some had tried half a dozen and nothing so far had worked :(.  What I want to say: Be patient about finding the right medication. Everybody reacts individually to psychiatric medications. Some people unfortunately have to try more different one before they find one that works for them.  Make sure your doctor is ready to try different medications and does not insist on ones that just don't work for you. If they do, get a better doctor.  If you want to know my medications, I can PM them to you."

Anxiety,3du057,toastedenigma,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:25:24 2015 UTC,"Hello! To agree with others, make sure you are transparent with your physician about what you are feeling so they can help decide which medication will be best for you. They take some time to work, and sometimes don't have the desired effects. So be especially attentive during the beginning to note how a new medicine affects you!  For myself, I've had anxiety and depression nearly all of my life. I began taking Zoloft when I was in elementary school, and continued taking it for 11-12 years (dosage changed throughout). I recently switched to Prozac after a very intense period of depression, but it does help my anxiety somewhat (albeit less than the Zoloft did).   I've never taken any benzodiazepines, only SSRIs, so I can't give you any personal experience on those."
Anxiety,3duzb7,vembryrsig,3,Sun Jul 19 19:01:04 2015 UTC,"You don't need reassurance - you need to learn how to control your anxious thoughts and your body.  Try to stop and think about that for a bit.   And if your stress is causing physical symptoms it isn't too hard to realize it.  Try tensing and releasing your muscles - for example opening your mouth wide.  Or stand up - grab the floor with your toes, now use your legs and squeeze that floor together.  Feel your butt tighten in and your chest come out.  Relax it back to your toes.    Was anything already tight? Did it relax? Do the same thing from your arms up to your neck.    If you sit around all day or lie around with your neck tensed (eg using your phone) you'll notice your neck is messed up and can probably fix your numbness by doing some simple movements every hour or trying this exercise.  Sit up straight. Right hand under your butt. Now grab your head and tilt it to the left to stretch. Repeat on the other side.   That last exercise over several days depending on the severity of your neck will clear you right up."

It really won't help you or calm you down, and focusing away from that is important right now especially with you freaking out. You've been to the doctor and so far nothing is wrong besides your infection and anxiety. Take it one step at a time. Also, meditation might help. Right now you're going through a lot of stress, which is manifesting in your anxieties sky-rocketing.

You don't know how much this means to me to hear someone else has this and had it checked out. I totally have it too. And you know what I think? It's not that our arms are numb it's that our nervous system is over active and we are feeling every little thing. So we ""think"" our arm is numb but actually we are experiencing something like an out of body thing where the arm feels like its not ours because we are so aware it is there. Does that make sense? Maybe I am not right on the science but I totally get you and it trips me out. I always stare at my arm like WTF is this. But we both have this so I hope it helps to know that. My therapist told me, ""you must endure."" That's what we must do. My heart goes out to you. We will endure together.  *Edit: Just out of curiousity is it your left arm and leg?

Anxiety,3duzb7,canadianlady,2,Sun Jul 19 22:08:12 2015 UTC,"I wanted to add some things. You might possibly be going through PTSD from what happened to your bf's dad. When I first started getting panic attacks/anxiety about my health it was around the anniversary of my sister's death (she died of cancer as well). Even though it's not your father it is still something very traumatic and may effect you in more ways than you realize.  Okay and here's some things I've been doing. First of all never look up stuff online. Second off, try to trust your doctors. Thirdly, don't go seeking reassurance. You have to build up your own reassurance, it will be slow and a lot of work, but you can make your way. Is there anyone you can talk to besides your bf? I understand why he is going through a lot and it would not be best to ask him for support. You need to get out of your own head and hear from other people that you are okay and there is nothing wrong. If you want any more tips/advice I'd be happy to help, just let me know."
Anxiety,3duxn2,gupreka,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:46:58 2015 UTC,"I'm going to tell you what my therapist told me. Being an anxious person doesn't mean that you are psychotic nor will it cause any permanent health/mental damage. I know you've been dealing with this for your entire life but I think it's because you haven't had any treatment/counselling and it's become ingrained in you.   So bottomline you are not psychotic.  Next, I'm going to bet...you are from the US? That is so crazy that they don't provide support for that. What about school counselling? Don't you have that? I'm thinking there must be some sort of free help you can get? But I could be wrong.  If I am, you should know general anxiety is totally manageable but you need to be taught how to manage it. I say manageable because it's not a promise that you will be 100% better but that you will find a way to live with it and maybe one day be ""100%."" (I have not hit 100% yet but I am going to keep moving forward.)  Try reading some books and doing the activities there. (A quick Google search supplies a lot of resources.) You need to take the steps to straighten out your life. I know you are young but taking steps now will help you in the future.  If you have any questions or need any advice feel free to ask."
Anxiety,3duxn2,canadianlady,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:33:10 2015 UTC,"I used to have the same fears. When I was on Prozac a couple of years ago, I was having violent intrusive thoughts and it made me feel like I was psychotic.   At one point I started questioning the things I saw or heard because I was afraid I might be schizophrenic.   That was during a really difficult time in my life. I was in the middle of a crippling major depressive episode that I was going to treatment every day for.   Gradually, as I got better, I stopped fearing those things because I knew it was just anxiety.   It's common amongst people with anxiety to fear that you're going to have some worsening mental illness. But it's just your anxiety talking.   Anxiety can make things seem certain, but it's just anxiety. It's another trick our anxious mind plays on us."

Anxiety,3dtof5,Whomper,2,Sun Jul 19 10:25:04 2015 UTC,"Reading this I felt like I could have written it myself. I am newer to anxiety and new to this subforum. I think the amazing thing about this place is being able to read how many people are in a similar situation. For me, knowing that I'm not alone has been helpful.   Unfortunately I don't have any great advice to give, except to say that you should try to talk to a professional.  It's the first step towards feeling better.  My anxiety started out similar to yours. I felt like I was falling apart and I couldn't even find the root cause. Suddenly every little thing made me terrified. It got to the point where I had to make an appointment with a therapist or I felt like I would combust.  I found a non-profit organization in my area.   I made an appt with a therapist and I broke down in his office (we're talking snot and tears); it was embarrassing but afterward he laid out a ""plan of attack"" for me and it felt like a weight was lifted off my shoulders.  It has still been a rough but now I feel like I can eventually get better.    I decided to try to take medication so I take a low dose of Ativan as needed. My panic attacks are similar to yours where I feel like I'm having a heart attack. So the pills help me, personally, when I start to feel a tightness in my chest or upper arm. I guess they keep my panic attack from escalating. Not everyone feels comfortable or likes taking medication, I understand that.   I'm also waiting for a spot to open in group therapy. I can't testify toward it's effectiveness myself but I have a few friends who have had success with it.   What I'm trying to say is, as terrifying as this is you do have options. It's really scary to make that first step but it is worth it. Hang in there! I'm definitely rooting for you.   In the meantime you might find Mindfulness exercises helpful. They help calm me down when the panic starts. I always recommend Sam Harris' mindfulness meditation. It's a free 9 minute podcast and the techniques he teaches have really helped me get out of my own head."
Anxiety,3dtof5,squealingpotatoes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:04:10 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. It's definitely comforting knowing I'm not alone in this. I have booked an appointment with my GP for today so hopefully he can guide me onto the next step in dealing with this.  The last time i spoke to my GP he told me if the panic attacks persist a therapist would be the next step so hopefully that will help.  Thanks for your support and I wish you all the best.
Anxiety,3du1qw,eindride,4,Sun Jul 19 13:45:58 2015 UTC,"Forget about him and move on to the next one.   It's really hard to get to know someone over text and even harder to read into them accurately. Next time, I would chat for a little bit then ask to meet up. You'll get so much more from meeting him in person and won't have to deal with all of the anxieties of a text conversation as much.   Meeting someone you met on Tinder is really scary but it's much easier to meet them and then decide if you/him are interested and go from there."
Anxiety,3du1qw,princessfart,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:15:30 2015 UTC,"While Tinder and other online dating sites can make it a lot easier to make contact and engage in conversation, it's also a lot easier for people to flake out and not feel committed to actually dating. I would say keep the texting to a minimum and meet sooner rather than later. That way you will have some stuff to talk about when you first meet (enough to get through one date), and you will see if they are really interested in dating (in general, not just you). I've had tons of flakes, but I'd rather know up front then after a week or two of texting. Even talking on the phone can be a step in the right direction."
Anxiety,3dsmqj,InsidiousLux,7,Sun Jul 19 01:48:25 2015 UTC,"I'm currently dealing with this problem, and it's horrible at work. I have a very detail-oriented job that requires a lot of research, and it's taking me twice as long to get my work done. I'm trying to be easy on myself. My anxiety is so bad that all I want to do is stay in bed, so I'm trying to remind myself that it's an accomplishment that I've been going to work and getting stuff done. I hope you find some relief!"

It used to drive me insane since it felt like my brain was eating itself to death and there was nothing I could do.  But that turned out to just be the anxiety talking.  It was holding me back in more ways than I knew and once I managed to see what I had to do, it cleared up like sunlight bursting through rain clouds.  If you don't have anything better to do and it's still troubling you, I'd like to recommend you watch a certain movie. Have you heard of Iron Man 3? :) Watch it, and see if it does anything to you."
Anxiety,3dsmqj,FreedomV2,6,Sun Jul 19 03:56:48 2015 UTC,You're absolutely not alone in this. This has been happening to me a lot lately. Sometimes the best thing to do is to back off just a bit/take a break if you can. I know it's difficult - I pushed myself to go into work on a Saturday to catch up only to waste my entire time there bc I had so much anxiety I couldn't think straight. Sometimes you have no choice but to back off a bit.
Anxiety,3dsmqj,mar3b3ar,5,Sun Jul 19 08:49:15 2015 UTC,"Anxiety is known to cloud thinking/concentration, you'll need to find ways to keep it at bay, so that you're not overly concerned about everything and can ""let things/worries slide when needed"". I'd say meditation, exercise will definitely help you as it gives you a chance to distant yourself from your thoughts and worries and gives you the ability think rationally. Hope you feel better soon :). you're not alone!"
Anxiety,3dsmqj,SamX1962,4,Sun Jul 19 09:40:38 2015 UTC,"The adrenaline rush from anxiety will cause all sorts of symptoms. The adrenaline is supposed to help us flee from predators, so our sense of smell and sound is heightened, and it helps us to be on the alert and aware of everything in our surroundings so it becomes extremely hard to concentrate on one thing. Of course we aren't running from a predator, our brains are just misfiring and sending the wrong signals to the body due to stress! All the feelings we have from anxiety are coming from basic survival instincts and even though the feelings are extremely uncomfortable, it's not dangerous. I hope this helps clear up why you can't concentrate."

Anxiety,3dsab4,joule_x400,3,Sun Jul 19 07:36:53 2015 UTC,"Never ever feel guilty for not showing emotion like others do. We all deal with situations differently. I'm a huge pigeon lover and I had two female, indoor pet pigeons. One of them who was only two years old had a prolapse in her cloaca (their ""genitals"") and we had to have her euthanized because it was a cancerous growth causing the prolapse. My husband was devastated as was I, but while he sobbed in the car on the way home from the vet's office after she was euthanized, I didn't. It doesn't mean I wasn't sad, I just felt so overwhelmed that I couldn't. Sometimes anxiety can do that to people. We freeze instead of reacting because the stress is too much. Never feel guilty, OP about your emotions. We are human. I'm sorry for the loss of your cat :( losing pets are so hard. Their love for us is unconditional and innocent."

It's important to grieve and feel a sense of loss, and there's no right or wrong way to show that, as long as it's not damaging to yourself or others.  So let out a good cry, share the moment with your mom.  Or don't. Neither is right or wrong. I tend to be the same way as you've described.  When people pass that are close to myself or loved ones, I get emotional at first but then I find it hard to empathise with them and don't really show much emotion. It's not worth beating yourself up over.  You are the way you are and you'll continue to be that way.  It's more important to accept that you are this way than to let it bother you."

Anxiety,3dt7cf,Goere,3,Sun Jul 19 05:38:08 2015 UTC,"Hi, (I'm a 23 year old female) I have terrible anxiety (mainly social) and I was actually a theatre major my freshman year of college. I really only did it because I had a lot of friends in the program and was able to get a scholarship. I did have a slight leg up because I had been in stage productions starting in elementary school, but my anxiety didn't start being so intense until I was about 17. Plus college theatre was a whole new ball game.   I'm going to be honest with you. There are going to be some totally scary moments. You have to let yourself be completely vulnerable with a room full of strangers and obviously that is really scary. But improv can be super fun and rewarding and you will laugh a lot. You just have to push through the rough moments. And you have to go in accepting the fact that you will screw up. Also, remember that you are not the only one in the room who is new to this. You will definitely grow from taking the class and it was a very adult decision to face your fears this way. Keep in mind in moments of panic that the worst that can happen is that you will look stupid to a room of people for a few seconds. Just take it 10 seconds at a time and you will be totally fine!"
Anxiety,3dt7cf,apizzaurheart,2,Sun Jul 19 06:10:00 2015 UTC,"Go to at least one. Worst case scenario, you become intolerably anxious, leave, and never return. Remember, exposure kills anxiety!"
Anxiety,3dt7cf,atom_flesh,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:55:16 2015 UTC,"I am a terrible public speaker, and even get anxiety speaking in small groups. That being said, I was in the theater program at my college and LOVED it! I even had some starring roles. Yes, there were some moments of nervousness - but the opportunity to ""play someone else"" helped relieve any stage fright I had.   My advice? Go to the first class as more of an observer than a participant. Take a look at the people who are there - you'll probably see a mix of males and females, small and large, who come from different backgrounds (ethnic, economic, etc.) You'll see them acting in ridiculous situations and making complete idiots of themselves. And if they can do it, why can't you? The reason why improv classes are great is because EVERYONE is making a fool of themselves! And not only is making a fool of yourself completely okay, but it's encouraged and rewarded (with laughs and applause).   It might also help to watch some improv videos on YouTube to get a sense of what classes might be like. Even if it doesn't work out (which I fully believe it will!) make sure to give yourself credit for trying something new and stepping outside of your comfort zone. You're awesome!"

It's a hard fucking spot to be in, we've all been there at some point; you are not alone.   Although moving to a new place can be overwhelming, I LOVE to explore. Maybe if you went out walking to explore in the mornings you'd start to feel the place belongs to you more. See where the streets go, are there any nice shops around?   Also, men seem to do that. They feel they are responcable for your happiness somehow. It's very sweet he is worried for you, just make sure he knows that your happiness is your job, not his.  I don't get out much either. The more you shut yourself in the worse it seems to get. I'm doing the mommy job right now, so it's a slightly different situation. Are there any gym classes you can take? Or free classes at a community center? Games you are interested in at a game store (they usually have game nights). Walking groups? If you are religious at all, that can be a good place to get in touch with people/activities. Maybe volunteer at a food shelter, or to visit at a hospice or home? Volunteering is a great way to fill up time and feel good about yourself. Of course, don't stop looking for work, but you can work for free in the meantime if it helps you."

It just seems that sitting there doing nothing, getting more and more depressed isn't going to help. You need to make a change, because right now you are only going to keep self sabotaging, as you aren't listening to your instincts.

Anxiety,3drvxa,whereismyxanax,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:27:38 2015 UTC,"Have you tried making a pros and cons list? That might be helpful for making a big decision.  Have you heard of an app called 'Headspace'? Its for meditation and offers a 10 day free trial. I recommend giving that a go, its only once a day for a few minutes, but can bring real peace, and a break from your constant thoughts. Have you tried talking to your bf about your feelings? From what you've said, he seems reasonable. Talking and being open about your struggle as a couple is important so that he can understand some of your behaviour and so you don't feel alone in your battle.  Is there a library near by that you could visit? If so, maybe try going at a quiet time in the day (if you want to avoid people). And look up a book called 'You can Heal your life' by Louise L Hay, or ' The Power of Now' by Eckhart Tolle. They are empowering, understandable and can fill you with hope. Another book to read is called 'The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari'. That last one talks about what you need in life to be happy. Sitting at home, limiting your social time, lack of exercise, inadequate nutrition, sleep deprivation,  disconnect from nature and other things will inevitably lead to depression, and the more you keep going along, the more it becomes a habit and seems harder to break. But the books above will give you hope and encourage you to step out and challenge yourself.  I hope this message helps you in your journey."

Also, when you start school in the fall, it might be a good idea to schedule an appointment with a therapist there. It will probably be cheap or even free.

If your school doesn't have therapists available, then maybe you could go to a private one. I think it's a good idea to consider getting a therapist sooner rather than later so that you have more support. You can either google the name of your town/a nearby one + therapist, or you can go to psychologytoday.com's therapist finder and search by your zip code or city.

Psychologytoday.com is great because each profile has information like an email address and/or phone number, how much is charged, whether the professional charges on a sliding scale, and what he or she specializes in!  I recommend emailing or calling a few therapists and briefly giving them a run down of what you're going through along with your symptoms. See how the therapists respond and get a first impression of them. This greatly reduces your chances of getting a therapist you don't click with and you won't waste your time and money!"

Anxiety,3dstb9,Skycakes,0,Sun Jul 19 05:41:47 2015 UTC,The elimination diet is not an expensive one. You pretty much cut out all types of food that could be effecting you. Basically eliminate foods that are typically bad and just keep it simple. They say eat chicken and turkey breast instead of red meat for instance. They say to lay off citrus fruits and tomatoes due to acidity. It's basically just simplifying your diet.

Not that doctors are never wrong or that blogs are never right, but Doctors do know what they're doing (or will refer you to someone who does).  However, yes there are some foods/drinks that can worsen anxiety: sugar, stimulants, etc."
Anxiety,3dstb9,BlockPuppet,0,Sun Jul 19 16:48:27 2015 UTC,"The author is a holistic health counselor. She seems like a pretty legit source of information. I think she can be referred to as a health doctor.  Something about doctors is that they vary in effectiveness. Just like trying to find the right mechanic, you have to find the right doctor. While trying to find a good doctor, you have to come up with methods to feel better on your own, otherwise you will just go mad.  You are saying that all doctors offer the same treatments, but that isn't true at all. One doctor might tell you one thing, while another might tell you another. I've seen way too many cases of people getting misdiagnosed.  I think you are downplaying the role of food in mental healthcare. I'm sorry if I sound like I'm standing on a soapbox, but there are just so many foods out there that contain ingredients that are simply bad for us. I think a lot of foods can worsen anxiety, and not just some. I'm a person who basically thinks with my stomach, so it is insanely easy for my stomach to get upset. There is so much research on the brain/gut connection these days.  People with anxiety have the propensity to ""feel"" more. For me, when I eat something that doesn't sit well, it causes anxiety because I cannot stop thinking about it. I know the anxiety starts between the ears (in our brains), but it helps to weed out other factors. It'll even help your doctor. Like I said earlier, if you present to your doctor what you have been doing, they are going to take you seriously.   Just like if you go to a mechanic and tell them you've done research, and maybe had other estimates, they are going to take your seriously (sorry, I'm a very analogous person). I liken our bodies to a machine, or vehicle, if you couldn't tell.  The best I have ever felt in my life was when I was cooking the majority of my own healthy meals, and exercising every day. The hardest part for me is actually sticking to a diet, because it is so easy to eat something that is already prepared.  My question is, why not at least try it? It is not like some gimmicky diet.  TL;DR You are what you eat."
Anxiety,3dstb9,BlockPuppet,2,Sun Jul 19 17:26:59 2015 UTC,"holistic health counselor   You don't need to go through med school to be called that. To be called a Doctor you need to have been through med school.  I'm not saying that eating healthily isn't good for you, I'm saying that Doctors know what they're doing when it comes to medical conditions. Heck I'm not even saying that doctors won't prescribe better diet and more exercise to help with anxiety, I'm saying that when it comes to medical issues - go to the people with medical training (doctors).  Whilst the media loves to run stories of malpractice, the actual incidence of it is incredibly low. Especially with easy to diagnose conditions like anxiety."
Anxiety,3dstb9,sonicfreak360,0,Sun Jul 19 17:38:18 2015 UTC,"I trust someone with her background (regarding stomach issues) more so than a traditional doctor, but that's just me with my previous experiences.   I think, ultimately, we agree here. but I just don't know how you can simply say ""doctors"" when every single doctor is going to be different. IMHO, there are good doctors, then there is everyone else. It is very difficult to find a really good one. And what doctors should we be seeing GPs, gastro docs, mental health docs? Probably should see all 3, and that adds up from a money perspective.  You're right in that we see what the media tells us. They can be awful.   I had a horrible experience with a psychiatrist before that really opened my eyes. It wasn't malpractice or anything, but it was a bad experience that made me think twice.  Long story short, the facility I was going to had a psychiatrist that came out of retirement to do some more ""doctoring"". When I first saw him, it was like he was writing a prescription before I got in the door. There was no connection at all, he knew what he wanted to give me.   The dude never experienced what I've experienced before, so how could he possibly know what to prescribe me? I want to truly talk to a doctor that has experienced some sort of mental anguish, so they can step in my shoes, but that probably isn't happening."

Anxiety,3ds2mn,AdolMHC,2,Sat Jul 18 22:29:55 2015 UTC,"I haven't done therapy but I am a captain on a debate team.  For whatever reason we attract a lot of extremely anxious shy kids.  Its best not to single them out to much and have them say small things in front of a crowd like their name.  Stuff they can't possibly mess up.  A game I like to play is sort of like musical chairs.  You have one person stand in the middle and say something like ""I don't like x"" and everyone who agrees with that statement runs to a different chair and whoever is left out has to say the next statement.  I like this game for two reasons one is it gets kids used to speaking in front of others and able to make something up on the spot and the other is because they can see that there are other people who are just like them.  If johny doesn't like x then he must be a safe person to talk to. Seriously be careful with this one though if they are not ready for it they will freak out.  One thing my friends therapist did is have him walk down the hallway with him then he introduced him to people he hadn't met before then walked away so he could practice making conversation. He said this is what helped him more than anything."

Before I start listing things, you may also get helpful feedback from /r/psychotherapy   1) Learning how to break things down into really small steps so that you can rack up immediate successes was critical in my recovery.  2) Learning coping skills like how to address a panic attack and calm myself down was very useful too.   3) Playing games to get to know each other was helpful and helped break the ice. We had this dice we would roll and then based on what number you rolled, you had to tell the same number of interesting things about yourself. This was a great way to feel more comfortable around the other patients.  4) I liked learning about boundaries, healthy vs unhealthy anger.  5) My therapists running the group gave me hope that mental illnesses can be beaten because they had mental illnesses themselves! Maybe you can give real life examples of famous people or regular people with mental illnesses who have been successful. Learning that my depression and anxiety were not death sentences was huge!!!"

And 20 was too many pages for most of us), and they had magazines we could cut stuff out of, quotes, poems, etc. They also had lots of markers and art supplies.   I think that was a really cool idea.

Also, as someone who hates taking meds and has stopped several times, I'm back on them now because they really make a difference. I stopped six months ago because they gave me heartburn, but my anxiety and panic escalated again to the point that I almost wasn't able to function. I just got back on them last week, and I can already feel a difference. My panic attacks are more sparse, and I'm not as consumed with anxiety and irrational fears.   Also, I think it's helpful to pat yourself on the back for making yourself go out, and being there for your kid, despite your fears--those are huge feats when you have crippling anxiety!

Uni GPs are used to seeing people without a regular doctor who have mental health issues arise.  They're actually really on the lookout for mental health issues and are likely to be really helpful.   It's their job to care about your health and get you connected to the care you need.  Do you have a Medicare card of your own yet?

Anxiety,3dsd35,cactusesandcats,7,Sun Jul 19 00:10:15 2015 UTC,"So I'm going to be frank and honest with you here.  The reason you feel so terribly about the jobs you've had in the past is nothing to do with the jobs themselves.  Your anxiety is the issue.  Any job you will have you will feel a level of discomfort and this is what you must accept and focus on constructively dealing and moving with it.  You are currently in some desperate search for the perfect job that you hope is there and will suit you perfectly - but that's not the issue. The real issue are your thoughts surrounding the idea of going to work and facing the anxious feelings you think you will feel.  I think you need to see it in this way, it might help you realise that the only enemy you have is yourself. Every attempt at a new job will inevitably end with failure of you are approaching it from the angle you currently see it. Instead, accept the anxiety, allow it to be there and focus on dealing with it and allowing it to be there, know it is just your anxiety. Give up the desperate search for the ideal job that you can maybe handle - this way of thinking won't help you at all.  There will be anxiety, and you will be ok. You can and will move through this and start to live in peace again."

Anxiety,3dpt6r,Thatweasel,5,Sat Jul 18 11:12:00 2015 UTC,"Most psychology ""studies"" are not scientific. I am a biologist with anxiety disorder, and it is laughable to read the ""studies"" and ""conclusions"" drawn from said ""studies"" in the field of psychology. Science has a method, and it is not used in psychology. Nobody would love to see actual scientific studies done in the mental health field more than I would. I suspect there is a huge genetic factor and that many mental illnesses have more to do with brain chemicals (caused by genetics/gene expression) than anything else. In a sense, they are biochemical imbalances that manifest as psychological imbalances."
Anxiety,3dpt6r,manyshaped,4,Sat Jul 18 17:44:21 2015 UTC,"In science there are extremely important meta studies that rather than performing research themselves they compile data from other studies. These have saved thousands of lives in the past by showing that some medications did in fact have statistically significant side effects that didn't show up in each individual study. There is a great book called bad science that has a chapter on them.  I can't look at this study right now so I can't speak for its usefulness but using Google to find research data doesn't discount findings.  EDIT: oh I see, forum posts were their sources. Well that doesn't necessarily discount everything. If it showed a significant number of people reporting side effects online it might still show something important."

It's not everyone who gets protracted withdrawal symptoms though. Depends on how long you've been taking drugs for and how old you are. I'm currently undergoing it myself because I figured that my 'slow' taper of venlafaxine was 'slow enough' which it wasn't - and my life has been a living hell since because I took a chance on it. - ended up having to reinstate to 37.5 mg of venlafaxine.

When you're ready List all symptoms which make you think you will die and work through them being a voice of reason against the anxiety. For example, a headache is usually stress, tension, dehydration or in rare cases viral like the flu. You will not die from these. Look for the evidence, you've had 100 headaches and you're still alive and well...have you had a headache that's led to something more severe? No have you died? No. I know it sounds silly but you have to tell yourself this every time to reinforce it. Chest pains again is just a muscle spasm. You've recovered each and every time have you not? Your body is an amazing machine which will tell you if something is seriously wrong. I study biochemistry and there are so many mechanisms your body employs to keep you alive and well. So trust yourself. The tiredness will be from anxiety, it sounds like health anxiety/ocd so it might help finding a forum to talk to people who understand and find out how they recovered. Good luck"

Consider reaching out for help as soon as you can, so that you don't get worse. Maybe it's a good idea to see a doctor just to get some blood work done and some other tests for your heart. The reason why I say it's a good idea to get help is because these things can snowball into big problems if left alone. Be proactive about your health and take care of this now!!!

What helps me when I encounter anxiety is to focus on others and be myself. That is acknowledge that you can't be the funniest or smartest person in the world. So just be you and show respect to others you would expect yourself. Don't feel the need to be the chattiest and smartest, let your work and personality speak for itself. Many make the mistake of trying to be so done they are not and put unnecessary pressure on themselves.

Anxiety,3dqd1i,aerored82,7,Sat Jul 18 13:30:34 2015 UTC,"You haven't found your niche. You need to explore your feelings towards jobs by imagining doing them - career councelling DIY-style.  Why take a job as stressful as a waitress if you are anxious? It doesn't add up.  You gotta work out what the cause of the anx is - is it fear of failure, or making a mistake? In which case you need to practice the skills of the job so you master it... (So many employers take a 'sink or swim' approach, it's sickening)... or are you afraid of being a noob?   Are you outgoing - an extravert - love being around people (when there is no job to do)? If not, you should look for something more boring like an office job.  I think you are more likely introverted and all that goes with it, but only you can decide.  But serving others is unlikely to suit someone with anxiety - what happens when a client is angry?  Tell your SO that once you have found your niche work won't be a problem, but in fact I do think it's worth turning this one down, and working on the issue - turn 'finding my niche' into a project!  Make your life something you plan joyfully, definitively, not responding to random 'opportunities' with fear.  But I always say it - your doc is negligent (there is no other word for it) to prescribe meds without some kind of treatment plan by way of councelling, therapy, etc.  These things always have side-effects anyway, so really think hard before starting that crap.  It sounds like you need therapy to work through your self-worth issues,  which may stem from your parents or teachers.  You are young - get on top of this now and live a happy life. It might take a year or two of struggle, but it will be worth it.  It's not a life sentence.  Many people - perhaps it should be 'most' people - don't live a healthy lifestyle.  If you don't get exercise or enough sleep or eat well,  you can't expect your mind to be healthy.  There's a whole train of mitigation strategies on this sub,and without being arrogant, my profile has a lot of good advice on it.

Or at least that's how it seems... I did ask him to read your comment and I think maybe that helped put things in a little bit better perspective for him. I don't know.

So take what I'm about to say with a grain of salt. I dont know your fiancee and neither do I know you.   One thing that comes to mind is that your fiancee maybe is in denial of issues he himself has inside of him - and seeing you having these issues forces into his conciousness these issues - and instead of dealing with it himself he projects it. The thing to remember in these kinds of situations is that you're not really at fault here - there's something in his subconciousness that makes him do as he does.   He's fighting a losing battle with the ghosts of his past possible, a losing battle because if you dont face yourself, your subconciousness wont let you forget it.   I also suspect that he ultimately means well, but simply handles these inner issues really poorly - possible because he never was taught how to deal with it."
Anxiety,3ds1pn,Luhaja,2,Sat Jul 18 23:45:46 2015 UTC,"First thing's first, you have to take care of yourself so you can take care of your son. Have you been to a GP to see if anything else is out of whack with your system? (I'm wondering if you have PPD or your hormones are ""screwed up"" after having a baby) Maybe start there before you go see the psychiatrist.  As for your SO, there could be many reasons why he's acting like this. It's sad, but there's still such a bad stigma with any sort of mental health issue, and that really needs to end. I know when I first started having panic attacks and realized I had issues, I was very hesitant to get help because of the stigma. Then I realized, it's a medical issue, just like anything else. Would I make someone with asthma feel bad for needing an inhaler? Of course not. It's medicine to help them live with a condition they have. That realization helped me a lot, which led me to see a therapist and get on meds, which have helped tremendously. Maybe because of what your SO had to deal with growing up makes him act the way he does. Maybe he really thinks you're just blowing everything out of proportion and by him telling you to ""get over it"" that's what you'll do. When I first started telling people I had panic attacks, they'd say ""Just calm down"" or ""Don't think about it"". Really? Because I'd love to do that, but my mind doesn't work like that. Gee, I never thought of just calming down! :/   As I said at the beginning, you need to take care of yourself for you and your son. Do whatever it takes, and don't let your SO talk you out of seeing the psychiatrist or getting on meds, if it comes to that. If he can't deal with it, the relationship will just get worse, you'll both be miserable, and it will definitely affect your son in the long run. The only thing I worry about is if you do end the relationship and your SO is bitter or vindictive, he might try to hold the whole ""mental health issues"" against you when it comes to custody. Get a good lawyer if it comes to that.   Good luck with whatever you decide. I hope the psychiatrist truly helps your situation. Just know, you're not alone."

So I will be calling her tomorrow and asking for a new blood work order to see if there's anything wonky. I am also afraid of ""mental issues"" being held against me in the event of separation. He's a good person, but divorce/separation seems to always bring out the worst in people, and if he thinks he's protecting our son he will not hesitate. I'm hoping going to therapy will provide me with a response though in that case; since I think I've read about people who had their therapist sign a statement saying they were doing fine and weren't a danger to their child. You are so right though. As for his behavior, I do think his father has ""ruined"" him for tolerance of mental illness; he drives me up the wall on a regular basis! And my mother has not helped matters; I know I've picked up some bad habits from her in regards to worry, emotional manipulation and avoidance; which my SO no doubt picks up on. My parents do not have the healthiest relationship, and I think he fears we will end up the same way. A lot of times he is very understanding though. I know its a lot to deal with..."
Anxiety,3ds1pn,Luhaja,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:50:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you both for replying-it is comforting beyond words to be affirmed and not dismissed, even if we are all just ""internet strangers."" I do wonder sometimes if he doesn't have some issues of his own, as you said, /u/luhaja. But he is very proud and I don't know if he will ever seek help for them, because despite living in Europe for many years, he seems to have internalized that stigma against mental health treatment. Or may it's fine until it involves someone he knows/loves? I don't know. I don't think he is being malicious though."
Anxiety,3dsobs,Wuhblam,2,Sun Jul 19 02:04:47 2015 UTC,"Get some water or coffee into your system and try to nibble on some sort of bread. If you're at home, try and lay down and have something goofy like Bob's burgers on and try and focus on that.   That's what helped me last time I drank too much!!"
Anxiety,3dsobs,Jenisaurus_Rex,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:16:51 2015 UTC,I'm hanging out with a friend in like an hour so hopefully she'll take me to get some food. She's good at keeping me out of my thoughts. Thank you

Anxiety,3dsobs,FpsGeorge,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:07:55 2015 UTC,Breathe. What are you worried about?
Anxiety,3dsobs,drancks,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:08:06 2015 UTC,I'm not worried about anything. My body just doesn't like feeling not normal. It throws me into an attack. I need help getting out of my head
Anxiety,3dsobs,drancks,2,Sun Jul 19 02:10:01 2015 UTC,"I totally 100% understand you, Wuhblam. It's something that affects me whenever I smoke pot. Personally, I hate not being in control of the way I feel and getting 'too' drunk or 'too' high makes me highly anxious. But just remember no matter what your body feels, you are okay. Take slow, deep breaths into your belly and exhale slowly to calm yourself down. You're gonna get through this!"
Anxiety,3dsobs,new_killer_amerika,3,Sun Jul 19 02:19:34 2015 UTC,Thank you. Smoking weed was what actually made me discover my anxiety. That's why I don't smoke anymore.
Anxiety,3dsobs,loggeronline,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:21:14 2015 UTC,"Yup. Like most drugs, it's a state of mind thing, if you're already an anxious person it can make things a lot worse!"
Anxiety,3dsk7u,niceloner10463484,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:21:35 2015 UTC,I can relate but for a whole different reason. I had suicidal tendencies back in high school and my noise cancelling headphones blocked out the world and pounded music in my head while I walked everywhere. If I didn't have that moment one day who knows what would happen. NIRVANA essentially saved my life.

Anxiety,3dsgfg,CocoFosho,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:46:46 2015 UTC,"I know where you are coming from.  During my time in college I've suffered persistent anxiety and depression and insomnia.  The thing is, I believe that the insomnia fed into all the other things.  I don't know if you've tried taking sleep aids before but I would recommend giving yourself a dose of Nyquil before bedtime when you don't have anything planned the next day and see if knocking out from that may help you feel better the next day."
Anxiety,3dqsyz,quantized_self,3,Sat Jul 18 15:44:08 2015 UTC,"I've been both a server and a barista for many years and I ALWAYS thought my bosses were plotting to fire me and all my coworkers hated me. I was paranoid about every single thing I said or did that might be cause for someone to dislike me or get me fired. I also put off applying to university because I kept changing my mind about majors and figured it was a ""sign"" that I should not apply. One day I sat my ass down at my computer and I forced myself to do it. Once I actually started school my stupid service job didn't matter... Cause they were just that, jobs. I never intended to do it forever and once I got to that mindset I seriously chilled out. I slowly realized that if my coworkers or customers hated me I didn't really care cause I was doing something that would get me to where I really wanted to be.  Anxiety does this dude. Every time you think a negative or paranoid thought just remember that as long as you're doing your job, you're fine. Register for classes and do it now.  Hope that makes sense? I've been in your shoes and forcing yourself to make a big change is scary but you'll be happier and that little shit won't matter."
Anxiety,3dqh6q,abg123rocks,5,Sat Jul 18 13:38:43 2015 UTC,"Skeletal deformity, really?  Your post is very rational and thought out - so you kinda answered the question yourself.  First you need to really decide if your problem is real or imagined.  As we can't see you, only you can decide.  Then if it's imagined - get therapy. costs money, takes time.  Or if it's real - get surgery. costs money, takes time.  So your real problem is - how to get the money?  First talk to that professional you chose from the decision above, and get a price to fix the problem - e.g. a years therapy costs $xxx, or dental surgery $yyy.  Then you know the height of the mountain you need to climb.  And the final item - think only of the money.  Never say 'I look ugly' again - think only that you need that money, and how to get it.   Think of what savings you can make, cut back on other stuff, get a raise, get another job,  maybe even get a loan.  But the problem is now ONLY about money, and that is solvable."
Anxiety,3dqh6q,aerored82,2,Sat Jul 18 14:47:13 2015 UTC,"You know I think i there's some natrual instinct within us humans that can cut through depression. When you have a goal in life that you really want, you really will do anything for it. I've been trying to get in that 'goal' mindset. Right now, it's not about being satisfied with where I am in life and how I look, its about working towards my goal and that makes me feel good. I'm still in my first year of uni, I have friends, I have good grades and I have no doubt that gonna get the degree and skills needed for a job that I enjoy/ pays well. When all of that's over, I'll finally be able to pay for and fix these cosmetic issues. Their will be nothing standing in the way between me and my happiness. Thanks for giving me a solid path to hope for."
Anxiety,3dqh6q,aerored82,2,Sat Jul 18 15:28:11 2015 UTC,"It seems you have a strong sense of purpose and direction,  (I also go over to the motivation sub, and that is a whole different story!) - I think you will have no problem reaching your goals."
Anxiety,3dqh6q,noginator,2,Sun Jul 19 20:48:25 2015 UTC,"I think your have really low self-esteem. Most people hate pictures of themselves, myself included. I am invisible on social media since I never allow pictures of myself to be taken. I know I'm an ugly bastard but that doesn't matter to other people, they like me for me. I'm working with a therapist and doing what I can to help the situation.  My best friend has the biggest underbite I've ever seen, but nobody who knows him gives a shit and neither does he. He is one of the most charismatic people I know.  I have a chipped front tooth (I've gotten it fixed twice but it keeps breaking) and an awkward amount of bottom teeth that I am self conscious about but some of my friends don't even realize. I'm my harshest critic, and I'm guessing you are too.   I just give a cocky, one-sided smirk these days for photos and it's become sort of my trademarks.  I would recommend seeing a therapist to deal with your self image issues because it's the root cause to your agoraphobia."
Anxiety,3dqh6q,noginator,2,Sat Jul 18 14:53:55 2015 UTC,"I know I'm harsh on myself because my friends don't have an issue on how I look but at the same time, I don't have that charm of a guy with a solid face or normal jaw. I know what's appealing about a male but I don't have those features. I've met girls who don't care but I also want to be able to look at myself in the mirror and feel like a man. I don't want to be taken advantage of for looking different or be pitied, pitty is for children and right now I only feel capable of being a child. Yes this stretches into more things such as my physique but they're not as 'in the way' or as much of a problem to me."
Anxiety,3dqh6q,noginator,2,Sat Jul 18 15:36:22 2015 UTC,"I work in a creative field dealing with characters so I have spent thousands of hours getting character's faces the correct look along with endless hours studying human faces. I can't help but evaluate my own face every now and then. I see my weak chin, shallow low - almost nonexistant cheek bones, strong lowered brow ridge, uneven ear placement, permanent bags under my eyes (I'm so young too!), asymmetrical nostrils, thin upper lip, weak jaw line, undefined undersized nose, my head size is humongous (most hats can't fit me), I have an unusual cranium shape (my forehead is flat at profile then planes to where my ears are), huge dead looking eyes, chubby cheeks, my jaw/teeth are tilted to the side, my facial muscles are enlarged in some areas, my neck is skinny, strong nasal-labial fold, funny looking philtrum, unusual mentolabial fold etc. etc. I could go on forever. Don't even get me started on my body.  Fortunately, only I see all of these flaws and features.  Abraham Lincoln used his looks to his advantage. People don't pity less than average looking people. If anything they take who you are and what you do at face value (hehe). They aren't biased towards the good looks, if anything it shows their true feelings about you, which is reassuring to me. Even I have acted differently to great looking people and I am disappointed in myself about letting my ego getting in the way of logical reasoning."
Anxiety,3dqh6q,noginator,2,Sat Jul 18 16:13:29 2015 UTC,But don't you every look at an actor or someone in TV and think that they're not good looking is charismatic enough to play the hero? Sometimes they get a lot of shit for just looking unlikable even though they're talented.
Anxiety,3dqh6q,noginator,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:28:07 2015 UTC,"That's not reality. Have you've ever watched real life stories of heroes played by a good looking actor then see the actual person? They are normal people! Hollywood plays on people's preconceived expectations.  Not every leading man is good looking and must rely on their talent. Steve Buscemi, James Gandolfini, Malcolm McDowell, Adrian Brody, Anthony Hopkins, Philip Seymore Hoffman, Jack Black, Bill Murray, Samuel Jackson, Ray Liotta, Tommy Lee Jones, Ron Pearlman, Benedict Cumberbatch, Ian Mckellen, Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke, Geoffrey Rush, Michael Cain, John Goodman, Willem Defoe, Jack Nicholson, Sean Penn, Jacky Chan, Sylvester Stallone, Morgan Freeman, Tim Robins etc.  I'll agree it's easier for good looking people because they get a bit of a pass, but not everyone can look like Chris Evans or Arnold Schwarzenegger. It makes the average guys success that much greater. I'm glad that I'm a guy because our looks are less attached to our 'worth' comparative to women."
