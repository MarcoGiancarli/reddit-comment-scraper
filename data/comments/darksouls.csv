darksouls,3e2rth,SgtS1mar,3,Tue Jul 21 16:56:13 2015 UTC,"The only thing that bothered me about the base game is that a few of the early levels were really well done with many different paths to take (FoFG, No man's wharf, Lost Bastille), but later on the areas just seemed like a straight line (Drangleic Castle, Aldias Keep, Dragon Aerie/Sanctuary).  The DLC has some of the best design choices in the series IMO, very fun and enough challenge to keep you on edge searching for that next bonfire."
darksouls,3e2rth,tpiddles121,2,Tue Jul 21 17:07:54 2015 UTC,"Don't forget being in a building in the middle of the desert, taking an elevator straight up, and ending up in a sinking castle in a lake of lava. Logic."
darksouls,3e2rth,SgtS1mar,6,Tue Jul 21 17:09:53 2015 UTC,"I read an interesting theory where as you hollow, you lose your memory and you can't remember how you got to Iron keep, you the character assumes he came up on the elevator. It's weak, and it's a shitty design, but it's a nice lampshade."
darksouls,3e2rth,SomeChefDude,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:51:48 2015 UTC,"The 'theory' I heard was that each LEVEL is more of a MEMORY with the road there being imagined rather than actually implemented. You're skipping the journey basically. Personally, I don't give a shit about interconnected worlds or whatever, I have fun playing the game regardless."
darksouls,3e2rth,sadguitarsolo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:59:58 2015 UTC,"I don't have fun playing it, though it has very very little to do with the level design."
darksouls,3e2rth,SomeChefDude,3,Tue Jul 21 21:38:56 2015 UTC,Have to remember thT time is convoluted in Drangleic though. /s
darksouls,3e2rth,Shitty_Human_Being,2,Tue Jul 21 17:19:06 2015 UTC,If you go into Majula mansion you see a map of all of Drangleic.  It's obvious that much of the journey you take is omitted purely based on the distance between the primal bonfires.  I think the Earthen Keep elevator argument is weak and overplayed.
darksouls,3e2rth,tpiddles121,4,Tue Jul 21 18:35:45 2015 UTC,Doesn't change the fact that it makes the game feel like a string of levels more than a world to explore.
darksouls,3e2rth,SgtS1mar,2,Tue Jul 21 18:44:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can see how it breaks immersion, but it is in keeping with the design aesthetic of the game overall.  Though they could have done a much better job of conveying the ""largeness"" of the world.  It's tough to do that in a game like Dark Souls where so much of the storytelling is behind the scenes.    I think it was a good execution of a poor design idea, i.e. going through snapshots of the large continent.  People loved Dark Souls' design because of how close together the areas felt, not how varied they were."
darksouls,3e2rth,tpiddles121,3,Tue Jul 21 18:56:59 2015 UTC,"They handled it well in Bloodborne. There are occasions when you are teleported to an area that would take far too long to walk. They go out of their way to clearly outline the area you're about to teleport to in visual queues throughout the level, such as it being the only thing visible through a door frame you're about to exit, drawing your eyes to it by putting an item on a ledge that points to it, etc.  DS2 is a lovely experience, but it does not even hold a candle to the titan of game design that is DS1. I am a shameless DS1 game design snob and I do not apologize."

Demon's Souls, DS1, and Bloodborne are three of my favorite games of all time, with Dark Souls being my indisputable favorite.   Edit: Dark Souls 2 is also great, but I wouldn't have it as a top 5.  I only play it anymore for its PvP."
darksouls,3e2rth,tpiddles121,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:53:36 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same camp, and I believe there's nothing wrong with being a fanboy for a deserving target. Miyazaki has proven to be a visionary multiple times. Hell, the only problem with Bloodborne is that there wasn't enough of it!   On that note, is there gonna be DLC for Bloodborne? I havn't been paying attention. Shameful. :'["
darksouls,3e2rth,YamiSilaas,2,Tue Jul 21 21:16:06 2015 UTC,Or traipsing through a wintery countryside and going inside a mansion and taking an elevator up and suddenly being on top of a range of columned mountains not visible from ground level for some reason.  Level design in DkS2 was hit and miss. World design just flat out sucked.

darksouls,3e2rth,YamiSilaas,10,Tue Jul 21 20:26:19 2015 UTC,"As has been said by basically every person, ever, the second isn't as good as the first. There are a lot of design decisions that, while not bad necessarily, just don't measure up to the thought that appears to have gone in to the original.  That said, it's still really fun, and the DLC is pretty great. The only thing that really bugged me was how they decided to artificially boost the difficulty by adding mobs everywhere. You can still pull single targets (I recommend keeping a bow equipped specifically for this), but more often than not you'll still end up with a mob chasing after you. It's just kinda lame. Every now and then is fine, but you can tell that the designers didn't quite grasp what it was that made the enemy encounters fun in the first game.  Still, it's whatever. Dark Souls is a tough game to measure up to, and DSII is still great in its own right."
darksouls,3e2rth,Dante2k4,4,Tue Jul 21 15:48:21 2015 UTC,"Dark Souls is a masterpiece and Dark Souls 2 is a really good game. I've been that guy who kinda shit on Dark Souls 2 a bit, but I'm trying to get away from that. It's not fair to what is unquestionably a great game to set the standard at ""must be a masterpiece"".  Not that Dark Souls doesn't have some flaws. For example, I'd be first in line to buy a remake if Miyazaki directed one that gave Lost Izalith the same level of creativity and depth as the better areas of the game."

darksouls,3e2rth,Swolan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:07:17 2015 UTC,"I don't actually dislike Izalith, exactly, but it's not to the same standard as the other areas of the game.  A lot of enemies are just plunked down on the map without any thought to how the encounters will work. That's even true up into Demon Ruins with the Taurus and Capra Demons, but it's especially glaring with the big walking dragon butts in the lava field.  And then the boss is famously the worst in the game. It was good to try something different (i.e. a puzzle boss), but the execution was poor and its ends up being tedious and frustrating without any of that ""tough but fair"" feeling you get for most of the other bosses.  The bit with Siegmeyer is good, though."

darksouls,3e2rth,YamiSilaas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:28:39 2015 UTC,"I just wish people in other fanbases could get beyond the ""must be a masterpiece"" mentality.  That being said, Lost Izalith, at least to me, just felt cramped and crowded. Past the Demon Ruins I really can't remember a single part of it where I felt I could safely draw a single enemy out to fight. So I just ran past the everything until the end."
darksouls,3e2rth,KHCunniff,2,Tue Jul 21 19:26:58 2015 UTC,"felt cramped and crowded   Which is funny, because to me it felt spacious and empty. Lots of enemies plunked down on the map, sure, but mostly just as filler for large empty spaces. If not for all those enemies, it would have captured the sense of a desolate ruin very well, but I don't feel it quite captured the sense of a once vibrant city. Too empty and not enough detail and character to really sell it like with a lot of the areas.  I did really like the architecture, though, and I liked all the overgrown vines.  Ultimately, it's an area that shows a lot of unrealized potential, I think."
darksouls,3e2rth,labcoat_samurai,2,Tue Jul 21 19:39:47 2015 UTC,"Personally I enjoyed Dark Souls 2 just as much, if not just a little more than the original. (I know I know. Burn me at the stake! Kill me with fire!) That being said, Dark Souls story is so incredible, Dark Souls 2's story doesn't even come close but I'm not certain many games can recreate the masterpiece of a story FROM created. The only thing I can tell you is that Dark Souls 2 is a great title, I enjoyed the tweaks to gameplay and weapons. Enjoy your play through!"

Resistance is like a really gimped version of a defensive stat, which makes it fun in a way.  Of course, if you're good enough not to get hit in the first place, you're probably doing SL1 runs instead of baby stuff like this."
darksouls,3e33y0,DrDeviljho,3,Tue Jul 21 16:48:46 2015 UTC,Yeah but with higher endurance you can equip heavier armour which provides way better defensive bonuses than resistance can.

darksouls,3e1gzy,Viper3D,7,Tue Jul 21 17:57:53 2015 UTC,"Blight town is tough, but do-able. Its certainly one of the harder area's in the game, but I didn't have nearly as much trouble there I I did in Anor Londo. Here are some tips I've got in no particular order:   Bring a lots of purple, & blooming, moss for curing poison and toxin. Like at least 15 regular purple, and 10 blooming; you'll need 'em. Because, going back up once your at the bottom is a pain. Bring a bow for killing the Blowdart Snipers from a far to avoid getting toxin buildup. They don't re-spawn so you only have to kill them once. There's only one or two in your way to the bottom, but like 5 guarding a fire keeper soul in an optional area.  You can get to the bottom quicker via the Valley of the Drakes if you have the master key. (The entrance to the valley is in New Londo) But you'll miss out on some good loot.  Get the rusted iron ring by returning to the undead asylum, it will let you move faster through the Poison swamp at the bottom.   An red NPC phantom will invade near the second bonfire in the swamp. Killing it will allow you to summon that phantom to help before the boss fight. Its useful if you cant find a player's summon sign and don't want to go it alone. Alternatively, if you arrived via the depths path, than you can get back up quicker via the Valley of the drakes. The exit to the valley is up the spinning elevator, along with the key to open the gate to New Londo in a nearby chest. (just follow the wall heading left from the 2nd bonfire)   Blighttown may be hard, but don't give up. I took me many hours my first playthrough, but when you beat the boss at the end it feels so satisfying. I felt so accomplished and it was a highlight of the game for me. Anyway, I hope this helps, and good luck on your descent into that treacherous place"
darksouls,3e1gzy,apathetic_youth,6,Tue Jul 21 09:32:46 2015 UTC,"You actually don't need the Master Key to access the short way, though it does make it a bit less tedious. You just have to go down to Darkroot Basin, take the elevator down to the Valley of the Drakes, and then run past the drakes to reach Blighttown. Then, as you mentioned, you can grab the key to New Londo and open that gate."

Go slowly or you will fall and die, when you see or hear an enemy moving don't move, just wait him to come to you and see the path he uses, this way you wont aggro too many at once and could save you. And there are some ranged woodlike enemies that throw darts at you, try to avoid them.  Good luck!"

It's safer to run across the branch on the way back than it is to walk across, or alternatively there's a jump you can attempt from above to get back."
darksouls,3e1gzy,Trencha,3,Tue Jul 21 16:27:35 2015 UTC,"Explore Firelink and you'll find a key + a way to get back to the Undead Asylum. The key opens the locked door near where you drop down on the Asylum Demon. Behind the door is a Rusted Iron Ring. It basically lets you keep your movement speed even in deep water/swamps. It'll be useful.  Also, stock up on Purple and Blooming Purple moss. You can keep killing the demon shrubs in Darkroot Garden as they drop both varieties. Alternatively, the female merchant near the entrance to the Depths also sells them.  The female merchant also sells poison arrows. Stock up.  There's a Spider Shield you can pick up in the Depths. It will let you fully block attacks that normally cause poison/toxic buildup (like the blowdart sniper's darts)"
darksouls,3e1gzy,apandya27,3,Tue Jul 21 13:08:26 2015 UTC,"I remember my very first playthrough. I finally managed to reach the bonefire at the ""bottom"" of blighttown and somehow - and this was the one and only time this ever happend to me in a souls game - something fucked up the save and - oh the horror - when I came back a couple of days later to play the next stage I was back again at the bonfire in the middle of blighttown. And then I've heard my girlfriend say ""I can't understand why you're so calm, I would have been raging around"".   Well, to answer your question: There are times in Dark Souls where you have all the reason to rage around. And there are times you have to go beyond raging. And Blighttown is the latter.  PS: Oh but I have a very important hint for you. Before going to blighttown you might consider visiting the undead parish first. Head for the elevator to firelink shrine and while descending pay very, very close attention. Descent and ascent a couple of times when you don't see it. Be brave, make a jump or two, explore what you find. There might be something very valuable hidden, but it's somewhat obscure to find and it's not on the ground."

darksouls,3e1gzy,maxacchilles,2,Tue Jul 21 20:46:06 2015 UTC,Just dive in and enjoy the experience :)  It's the place people love to hate.  It's really not thaaaat bad.  Take your time and move slowly as you learn the route.
darksouls,3e1gzy,samfivedot,2,Tue Jul 21 11:26:37 2015 UTC,"I didn't die very often in Blighttown, but I did have to go back to the bonfire quite a few times.  Firstly, if you have 15K souls to spare, buy the Poisonbite Ring from Oswald of Carim, on top of the Undead Church. It boosts your poison resistance by 90(?), but sadly doesn't affect toxic resistance.  Make sure you use the Spider Shield, as when blocking with it you can block 100% poison/toxic from attacks.  Kill Blowdart Snipers as soon as you see them. Run up with the Spider Shield up, and then just hit them until the pieces of sh** die. If you're lucky they will even drop more Blooming Moss for you!  Take lots of moss! Blooming is more important than standard Purple, because poison is not that dangerous.  When you reach the swamp at the bottom, head straight to the bonfire! Also, make sure you have Poisonbite and the Rusted Iron Ring (if you have it) equipped. The boost to your poison resistance means that, the majority of the time, you can sprint through the swamp between areas of safe ground, and wait in these areas for the poison buildup to go away. In most cases you won't get poisoned.  Mosquitoes come from hives, but these hives will only spawn 7 of the buggers (get it?) before they are empty (and of course this resets if you die/rest). To deal with them place yourself at the maximum distance you can while still aggroing them, and you should be able to deal with fine (as long as you are patient).  If you are going via the Depths entrance, go the other way on your way back up. The other way is shorter, there are fewer enemies, and also you can get the items there."
darksouls,3e1gzy,Mangoniter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:49:57 2015 UTC,"Get the Spider Shield. Just having that shield will make Blighttown quite a bit easier.  Go slowly - by that I mean fucking inch your way through the place. If you hear enemies roaring in the distance, stop what you're doing and wait for them to come to you. Keep your shield up - if your dude flinches like he blocked an attack, but you didn't see the attack, you just blocked a sniper dart.  Kill the snipers immediately when you see them. They don't respawn, so even if you die in the process, your next attempt will be easier.  When you get to the bottom, the second bonfire is close by. Find it before you go exploring in the swamp."

darksouls,3e1gzy,maralieus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:04:41 2015 UTC,"1) Repair your weapons and buy the repairbox, if your weapon is not at least +5 abort, if your weapon is the Drake Sword, build a different weapon up to +5, you'll thank me later.  2) Buy 10-15 of each kind of moss clump.  3) Get the spider Shield, there are 2 you can find in the game, one is on the stone bridge in the valley of the drakes, the other is in the upper part of the room with the giant rat in the Depths.  4) If you're patient, grind(get summoned for the boss) and get the Poisonbite Ring from mr.T-pose in the undead parish. If you equip the thief armor, the gargoyle tail axe and the Poisonbite ring, you will get a nice chunk of poison resist while being able to move quickly. If you started as a Pyromancer their armor also gives amazing poison resist.  5) You can usually trick shrek into falling off of the walkways. If not lure them back into more wide open areas. Do not block them if you have even a chance of dodging, 7 times out of 10 the massive blowback from their swings will leave you falling to your death.  6) Kill poison dart snipers, there's only like two to three total on the way down, and they don't respawn. Use the spider shield to avoid getting toxic'd while approaching them.  7) There's a giant... thing in the wall, just poke it with arrows from a safe distance.  8) If you can get to the valley of the drakes there is a shortcut that will skip you to right next to the last bonfire, there's still a few enemies to kill, but all in all its about 99% less frustrating.  9) If you ware falling to your death you can quit the game and reload it to end up back on the spot you were in before you fell off.  10) There's a key and a bird's nest above the undead asylum, I'm not going to tell you how to get them, but when you get the key go pretend you're an egg for a while. Once you end up in the new area, avoid the center of the very familiar wide open room and get ready for a real battle. Once you loot the worthless looking ring, you might want to think to equip it at the bottom of blighttown.  11) If the boss at the end hugs itself back away as quickly as possible. Watch out for lava, it deals damage and can make you flinch."

There should be an item set around there somewhere with hella poison and fire resist!  Amazing gear set seriously.  Gold hemmed something or other.  It will make the boss fight much easier.  Also use flash sweat for the boss.  :)  Edit: when you first enter blighttown, after fighting the first three shreks, stay left and leap of the edge to the platform with an item below.
