I went to Thailand for 5 weeks after having quit a serving job and I had people texting me the entire fucking trip asking me to pick up for them.  Random number: Heyyyy xxxx can you pick up my shift tonight? Me: I am in Thailand. Do not text me and ask our manager to remove me from the call list.  Three days later...  Random number 2: Hey!! Can you pick up some shifts for me?  WE HAVEN'T EVEN MET BEFORE. I DON'T WORK THERE ANYMORE."
TalesFromYourServer,3dyxnb,robynmichelle,28,Mon Jul 20 19:40:53 2015 UTC,"I was the random number once. I had to call in on my second shift at a new job because I'd gotten really really sick. I brought her a doctor's note after my doctor's appointment and told her I'd been diagnosed with bronchitis, it was contagious, and I couldn't work for a week. She handed me that weeks schedule and a giant binder full of names and numbers and told me I had to get all of my shifts covered or I'd be fired. The schedule only listed first names, and I didn't know anyone's last names. So if there was a John on the schedule, I called and texted every John etc. I got so many replies back that were like ""Um I haven't worked there in 5 years and I like in a different state now.""   Anyway, she was a giant bitch and instead of helping me, she made me sit in the office with a 104 fever, coughing so hard I would literally pee my pants a little, and gave me the binder that kept track of every employee that ever worked there. And she hated me the entire time I worked there because of that."

TalesFromYourServer,3dyxnb,Solor,7,Tue Jul 21 07:50:29 2015 UTC,"At my last job we only (I say only because apparently everyone else I talked to had it better) had 3 sick days every 6 months. But..if you used up just 1 you'd lose the other 2, or just used 2, you'd lose the third until 6 months were up (from the day you called in sick). According to the company, you can't get better in just a day or two. And if you were sick more than 3 you'd need a note. areyoufuckingkiddingme.jpg  So of course you'd have a bunch of people abusing this and ""get sick"" every 6 months like clock work for extra days off to ""stick it to the man""."

TalesFromYourServer,3e40ue,Litrebike,5,Tue Jul 21 20:01:39 2015 UTC,"Isn't this the point of Seattle's law anyway? Unless there's a loophole for service industry workers, people are supposedly now getting a fair, living wage and therefore don't have to be totally dependent on their tips. It's a dick move to ""educate"" people about the ""economics"" of it by leaving these stupid cards, but moving toward a wage structure in serving that's more equitable would mean less reliance on the vagaries of the (non-)tipping public."
TalesFromYourServer,3e40ue,staticfox,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:22:35 2015 UTC,"I think it's more nuanced than that. The article I linked suggests that the requirements for employers is to be phased in, partly related to how big the employer is. Chains and big franchises, large restaurant/hotel operations will have to comply much sooner than small employers and mom and pop businesses.  I think it's interesting how this will play out in Seattle. My experience in the UK, where we have much higher minimum wages compared to the US for hospitality workers, is that it makes working in restaurants and bars a low-prestige low-income job. The minimum wage means that people can get by, but they're never going to make a profession out of it; it's only ever going to be work to get by for the majority of people. You have to be in a city with a good foodie/craft culture for the tipping to kick in in order to make what you do (which certainly demands higher-than-minimum-wage skills) pay enough to be considered professionalized.  That said, my experience in France, where I have also lived and worked and where a proportion of menu prices are mandated to go to the service staff, is that working in a restaurant or high quality bar is seen as much as a ""calling"" as being a teacher or police officer. The French take pride in feeding and watering le grand public."

TalesFromYourServer,3dxp7v,WyomingFlip,9,Tue Jul 21 07:02:17 2015 UTC,"True Story-This is how I came to discover that even for bad service I will tip 10%..  I have never worked in the tipping industry but I typically tip anywhere from 15-20% depending on service. Meaning even if I think the service was indifferent I will tip 15%.  I was in a Bentonville, AR location of a place that likes to stuff there pizza crust with cheese for lunch.  They actually had wait staff for the tables.  I do not typically eat inside as normally I would either pick-up or have it delivered.  The waitress was probably 18 or younger.  She had a novel approach.  She simply stood at the end of the table until awkward silence ensued and I broke it by asking her if she was there to take our order.  THe indifference on this server's face was large.  We ordered four personal sized pizza's off the menu.  3 of the four orders were incorrect but as we were in a hurry elected to eat out pot-luck pizza's.  Now I am of the opinion that most likely this waitress is not entirely at fault.  She must surely had some poor management and certainly had poor training standards.  But regardless when it came time to pay I was staring at that tip line.  Mind you this was a business lunch.  I could tip the standard 15% and not lose any sleep as it was not truly my money.  But I felt I just flat could not.  So I did what I thought might get my point across with her level of service but not be a complete ass-clown and left her $1.  My colleagues and I discussed how bad the overall meal was and really how terrible things were and felt I had done the right thing.  Still had to hang my head in shame when I had to return to retrieve my suit jacket.  Kudos to her for not throwing my jacket away.  Wish I had just given her the 15%.  Now for truly bad service I tip 10% just in case I forget something."

TalesFromYourServer,3e02kh,Rajron,3,Mon Jul 20 22:51:14 2015 UTC,"I've got the reverse of that problem: asst manager keeps trying to get us to pre-bus more aggressively and I'm like ""if you want to clear tables that fast, go work in a McDonald's."""
TalesFromYourServer,3e02kh,matchy_blacks,2,Tue Jul 21 00:11:44 2015 UTC,Quite. And ashtrays are functional. You don't want them to be stinky and overflowing. But the world won't end if there's more than two butts in it for a few minutes. I'd rather let people enjoy their visit than be fussed and hovered over.   It's not as if I didn't have other tasks to do...!
TalesFromYourServer,3dzp3w,theDogfromFrasier,6,Mon Jul 20 20:58:01 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I worked in a restaurant that eventually bounced my paychecks, and it started with some sketchy pay stuff like you describe below. Definitely go to that Weds. job interview and maybe check out a few other options for getting out of there.  My experience has been that people who do sketchy stuff with their staff tips (LIKE TAKING THEM) are not making overall responsible decisions for the restaurant.   I think that enlisting the help of HF is a good plan -- someone who is maybe in a slightly less precarious employment position from you.  Can assistant manager help you at all?  I've worked with some AMs who are solid folks, and some who are basically in the back pocket of the law-breaking owners and therefore no help at all.   Last idea: Write everything down. Use your phone to snap photos of those paychecks. You are building a record that, if you needed it, could be used to make a legal claim against the owners."
TalesFromYourServer,3dzp3w,matchy_blacks,3,Mon Jul 20 21:28:16 2015 UTC,"I asked HF to take pics of all the notes and tips records left at work. HF worked today, and told me (last night) he would confront AM about the tip policy. I just texted him and found out AM is ""in the hospital"" so I hope she is okay.    The sad thing is that AM had worked in a successful catering company before she came here, and I think she would know better than to let the EMPLOYER literally take half of our tips."

They left Saturday for a week vacation in Florida, which they had to cut short as it was originally 2 weeks. The last two Fridays they wrote the whole staff individual personal ""paychecks"", with the tax amount written on the ""note"" line. I know for a fact they are not personally deducting my taxes and mailing it to the IRS?"
TalesFromYourServer,3dzp3w,techiebabe,5,Mon Jul 20 21:04:05 2015 UTC,The sic the Big Dog on them. AKA The IRS.  You might even get a percentage of funds recovered by the government.  The IRS HATES it  when people steal from them!
TalesFromYourServer,3dzp3w,techiebabe,0,Mon Jul 20 21:26:27 2015 UTC,I've never had to do anything like this before! I had HF take pics of the notes near the register saying what to do with the 50% of our CC tips. Do you think I could just call up the IRS googled number and have enough info to do in my boss? :(
