Plus, your prefrontal cortex (decision making part of your brain) doesn't reach full maturity until you're in your early 20's.  Maddening combination, isn't it?

It sounds like you need people in your corner right now who are going to stand up for you and protect you.  Also, if you suspect that it may have been one of your friends who may have outed you, whether accidentally of maliciously, you can know that they at least we're made to face the consequences of their actions.  You said your biggest fear was being outed to your dad and how he would take it.  Why do you think he would take it badly?  What about your mom, how do you think she'd respond?  I know it might be terrifying to even think about coming out to more people, especially if you feel that someone may have already betrayed your trust, but you've got to know that everyone who you come out to, everyone you can put in your corner, makes you stronger and the people who want to hurt you weaker."
LGBTeens,3e0lhn,tinfoildalek,2,Tue Jul 21 06:27:16 2015 UTC,Maybe one of your friends outed you while being drunk and didn't mean to. Maybe some asshole heard you/them talking. There are a lot of possibilities. It would be best to talk to them about it instead of anxiously guessing by yourself.

Taking a few ibuprofen every once in a while will do LITERALLY NOTHING in long-term damage.  That is what they are designed to do. They are designed so that you take a few and your pain lessens. It's not some Faustian deal with the devil where you trade present pain for future suffering. Of course, like anything, it is toxic and harmful in large amounts, but 600 mg is a pretty standard amount, and eating and drinking along with it helps too. You can't believe everything you read on the internet, especially with the ridiculous anti-modern-medicine fear-mongering that is so popular nowadays.

LGBTeens,3e1r05,Jodabomb24,2,Tue Jul 21 13:15:35 2015 UTC,"Let me share a story of when I accidentally took way too much Ibuprofen.   One night in my Freshman year of college (I'm a senior now) I was walking down some stairs at my college, and I slipped and came down on my foot really hard, which hurt pretty bad but not enough to make me think I broke something. I then got home, proceeded to take 3 Ibuprofen and then head to sleep. Two hours later, I woke up and was like ""damn, my foot hurts, I better take some Ibuprofen"" so I took three more and went to sleep. I was so tired, that I forgot I ever took them. Go figure, I kept forgetting every hour and taking two more. By the time I had to go to school the next day I had taken about 20 in the span of 7 hours. As you could probably guess, I was pretty out of it for the whole day, and my professor even sent me home.   I went to my doctor recently to talk about hormones, and he said ""blah blah blah these can potentially hurt your liver if you don't take care of it"" and he scanned me as soon as I told him that story, and there wasn't any long term damage. If I had kept taking Ibuprofen at that rate for a long time, I would have definitely messed up my liver, but it turned out okay because I was only dumb once. So if I'm fine with taking over 20 in one night, you'll be just fine with three.  That being said, use me as a cautionary tale. Be smart with your drugs, kids.  TL;DR: Hurt my leg, ended up taking 20 ibuprofen through that night with no long term effects."
LGBTeens,3e1r05,mswinndacey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:18:29 2015 UTC,What was the amount in each pill?
LGBTeens,3e1r05,SweetTomatoes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:00:52 2015 UTC,200 mg
LGBTeens,3e1r05,SweetTomatoes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:03:08 2015 UTC,"You're probably going to be fine.  600mg isn't terrible unless you're really underweight/ low in stature.  Be mindful of abdominal pain, it would help to eat something too."
LGBTeens,3e1r05,SweetTomatoes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:14:26 2015 UTC,"I already took the precaution to eat and I'm about 100 pounds, so I'm not sure what effect it'll have."

LGBTeens,3e1r05,emeraldfoxx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:18:08 2015 UTC,Hi! You'll be just fine:) just make sure you drink plenty of water. I take 3 everytime I need some. Granted I'm a fully grown guy. But if you've ever been prescribed it from you doctor then those are 600mg per pill. Like someone else said. Just don't do it often:) and just watch for things like really dark urine. But i really believe you have absolutely nothing to worry about.
LGBTeens,3e1r05,DeusBex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:35:34 2015 UTC,"You'll be fine. Probably uncomfortable, but fine. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is the one you really have to watch out for since it's in everything and is easy to OD on, but it takes a lot more ibuprofen to do any permanent damage."
LGBTeens,3e1r05,TyeDyeShirtKid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:10:45 2015 UTC,"A few months ago, I hurt my ribs quite badly. My doctor had me taking three, 200 mg ibuprofen pills three times per day. I had absolutely no side effects from it. You should be completely fine. Worst case scenario, your stomach hurts for a bit then feels better after a few hours."
LGBTeens,3e1r05,IstheLieReallyaCake,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:09:40 2015 UTC,"Don't take anything else, just drink some water and eat some food. You'll be okay. For a 100 lb person, the ideal amount of ibuprofen is 400mg, so you only went over a bit. As long as you don't do this frequently, your liver and stomach will be alright."

LGBTeens,3e1r05,ValleDaFighta,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:22:43 2015 UTC,Can you actually get addicted to abuprofen?
LGBTeens,3e1r05,TyeDyeShirtKid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:27:13 2015 UTC,You can get addicted to anything theoretically. And any type of pain medication is always good to be wary of. I wouldn't say I had a psychological addiction to it because I managed to stop without issue. But I became heavily dependent on it for all pain when playing sports and would routinely pop 4-5 pills before every practice or game without thinking much about it.

As for sounding like a creep, just be natural and friendly and there's no reason you shouldn't find a nice person :) To be honest, if you're that worried about sounding creepy then you most likely won't - its the guys that aren't aware of their creepiness that are the scariest."

But it does the job better than anything else. LGBT still leaves out a lot of people. And though I don't really think that ace/pan/etc. people wouldn't come just because their letter isn't in the acronym, but it's nice to be represented and be included.  And honestly, please, please be careful. I go to a very devoutly Catholic school and since they are a private school they have every right to kick me the fuck out, if they so please. Also, again depending on where you live, you could be in danger from your peers if they found out.  When I attempted to make my QSA at my school, I was shut down right from the get-go. I was told it was 'against the religion' of the school... for people with common interest to come together and form a support network... make friends... have a good time... not feel as fucking alone... so, expect the worst, but hope for the best.

My best friend is bi, and she's always talking about how she feels like she doesn't fit in. She's in a het relationship right now, and when I took her to Pride, she was scared that people wouldn't respect her. She says things like ""I should date more girls so I seem more bi"" and it really breaks my heart because she shouldn't have to force herself to do something she doesn't want to do just to ""seem more bi."" It makes me so sad that she can't just be comfortable with herself and her sexuality because of all the stigmas, stereotypes, lack of understanding, and dearth of real representation that comes with bisexuality."

LGBTeens,3dvl1t,Keniree,6,Sun Jul 19 22:05:02 2015 UTC,"This isn't real advice but, a part of me love reading posts like this because it just shows how we're all so similar deep down.  OK, now to the question...  The idea of an ""actor"" has been something I've been trying to work on this year. I kinda got a wake up call about it, when i moved schools two years ago and my ""actor"" persona wasn't doing very well socially. To put it bluntly, I've had one friend in the last two years. She is great and I'm super thankful for her existance, but still, I know im not a horrible guy, i could make more. And during the first year of the two i spent at that school, it was my actor that met people, and Id change him ever so slightly when talking to different people. In retrospect, this was all a ""fit-in"" mechanism, but not only was it not helping me ""fit-in"" it was also taking a toll on me psychologically and emotionally.   I would arrive at home crying frequently, even on the good days, actually, especially on the good days. Because, if i had managed to have a nice conversation with someone that day, in my mind, they'd only enjoyed being with my actor and not myself. And in turn, this would mean i would have to become more and more like my actor to continue talking to this person, which was something I didn't want to do. Or in other words, I needed people to like me so I wouldn't be alone, but I hated it when people liked me because it wasn't me.  This kept snowballing inside of me till I snapped early into second year. I wrote this super long facebook post where I listed things that I knew were true about myself and not about my actor, so that people could know the real me. At the time my logic was that, if people still talked to me after reading that, then they liked me for me and not for the actor.  Now what i realize was actually happening was me coming to terms with myself.  No one asked me to create this actor. No one asked to talk to him. It had always been me. I was the one who was scared to be myself around others. Because to me, the thought of not being liked and being alone was worse than the idea of someone only knowing me superficially. It was something my social anxiety had created to protect me from being hurt. Protect me from the emptiness that is not having someone to sit next to at lunch. Something I'd experienced before and wasn't looking forward to experiencing again.  When I realized this, (which granted took a while), I came to the conclusion that I needed to work on this myself with myself. And that if this whole thing was because I was scared of being my true self, then I first needed to come to peace with my true self.   And even though I would agree that me accepting myself as bi was a part of this, I wouldn't say it was all of it. I know straight people who go/went through similar things.  Its been 4 months since I've started ""accepting myself"" and I feel so much better already, its hard to write down. I still have some ways to go for sure. But, its liberating to know that I'm not lying to myself anymore. And nowadays, when I inevitably slip back into my actor to talk to a couple of people, the line between him and me isn't as fuzzy.   All I can say for you is; Love yourself, and know you're not alone. If you know who you are, and if you can easily draw the line between actor and you, then you'll be fine.   And as Abed, from my fav TV show Community, once said; "" When you really know who you are and what you like about yourself, changing for others isn't such a big deal."""
LGBTeens,3dvl1t,owlbewb,2,Sun Jul 19 22:58:57 2015 UTC,"It had always been me. I was the one who was scared to be myself around others. Because to me, the thought of not being liked and being alone was worse than the idea of someone only knowing me superficially.   So, I've been turning this over in my head for a while now. It's a little difficult to keep track of my train of thought but here goes.  Along with the anxiety there are a number of other parts of my personality that I am uncomfortable or ashamed of showing. One of the big ones was my depression, I couldn't allow myself to be sad, because that equated to ""I'm not capable enough to handle this"" and drawing unwanted attention from the school, my peers and parents. I was scared to show or reveal too much about myself, because that meant facing the issues and I was in a pretty toxic position in relation to a support network. Nobody I could be comfortable enough with.  Because of things like this, I ended up creating a character that was  my ideal version of myself. While not perfect, the character was everything I hoped to be; stronger, happier, more comfortable and confident. Capable of being open with people, which included sexuality. Not being afraid of allowing people close to him. I called this character Nick, a name that had been at the back of my mind for a number of years.  So, the pressures built up, and I eventually broke down after a bout of suicidal thoughts. Therapy, venting all the shit stored up over 15 years, all of the stuff that followed was part of a process of... healing? Accepting what was wrong and actively trying to change it.  As I recovered, a couple of things came to light. I'd been writing Nick into some stories and scenarios as a background character, a little reminder that there was something better. As I got happier, he came to be a more involved character. Two of my stories submitted to WritingPrompts on this account have him in there somewhere. One of them has him see a visual representation of an impending suicide in another boy's mind, and by simply talking to him, alters the cause of death. I hadn't chosen a name for the main character, I just wrote in Nick as a placeholder and kept it. The character he saves was a portrayal of myself a couple of months prior.  The second thing was that I'd been absentmindedly going ""What would Nick do?"" in response to making decisions. Things like whether I should go out with some friends (social anxiety) or talk to some random people (rejection). As I began to alter my mindset to think like Nick, I grew happier and more confident, meeting new people and getting recognised. I started paying more attention to my surroundings, doing little things for people, helping them out with problems and stuff like that. I grew braver, writing a speech on homophobia, which was read out to my entire class.  After all this, I started to see how the actor was still a representation of myself, and wasn't simply a ""mask"", to put on and take off as I had need of it. It became a permanent part of my identity, the ideal person I had created was blended with what I had been.  My original persona, with all the fear and distrust was just as much of a mask and defense mechanism, it just wasn't getting me anywhere. I've kind of realised the importance of the ""Nick"" persona, and I've ""replaced"" the former persona by ""being myself"". To reflect that, I am changing my name to Nick, because ny old name always felt foreign to me.  It's probably a little silly to you, but accepting that I am different now is important. I'm still flawed (very, verrrrry much so) but I'm a better person because of the mindset change."
LGBTeens,3dvl1t,owlbewb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:58:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not one to judge silly. I where a key on a chain around my neck because it reminds me of a happier place.   This process you went through; the important thing, as far as I'm concerned, is that you made it through and came out stronger on the other side.  Depression is sucks. I don't like it. Nobody likes it. But you've managed to do one of the hardest and bravest things and thats to admit to it. And because of that, things will only get better from here.  I'm glad you find that this mindset change makes you a better person, and I wish you luck with this and everything else.  Just remember, becoming a better person is fine, just as long as you don't become a different person. Because, after two years of acting as someone else, I've found that staying true to myself was/is a very hard but ultimately super rewarding job."

It's personally even more stressful for me when I'm with a group of friends that don't know. Or when I get ""Hey placespromised, any boys catching your eye?!"" from friends that don't know or anything to that extent.   It's putting a pretty personal part of yourself out there that might cause judgement, and a lot of people's social anxiety is due to that fear of rejection or judgement. It is scary. I'm trying to be more open with friends about it (the accepting ones of course!) and am ignoring what my anxiety is telling me and signing up for my school's GSA this year.   I don't know if I have much good insight but I'd be happy to talk to you about anxiety or any other experiences I've had with it!"

At least I think so. Also, sorry for the wall of text. This question appears a lot here.   If this question is about finding someone to date or sex up see section A. If you just want to find some cool friends feel free to skip ahead to B.  A) You are young! Like, in the scheme of life, you are so young! You pretty much have your whole life in front you. I get that whether you are in high school, or maybe even middle school, or just starting college there is a huge amount of pressure to find someone to connect with. I felt, at least during high school, that if I didn't find someone to date that I would be alone for my whole life. I realize now how silly that this. I know it sucks to be alone, it can even physically hurt. It helped me to find a set of friends that had similar interests as me. So even though I didn't have someone to cuddle with and fall in love with, I never felt alone. (P.S. I know it seems lame, but masturbation can really help you get over those ""I want to hook up right F**king now"")  B) Finding LGBTeen friends is a whole lot easier. First off, you posted here! That's a great first step! I've also had a lot of luck finding other LGBTeens over on /r/MakeNewFriendsHere and /r/Needafriend. Post over on those subs, you'll never know who might be lurking around. And yeah, I know now of these people can actually hang out with you, but you can still find some really cool friends. In terms of finding LGBTeens irl, I would just do things you enjoy. I was surprised by the amount of gay guys just existing around me.  So yeah, once again, sorry about the wall of text. I hope this helps! If you are ever feeling like you need someone to talk to, feel free to PM me. I'm always happy to talk to folks.  tl;dr: Do things you'll enjoy, gay guys are good at hiding in plain sight.

It tells them you are not heteronormative, but you're not outright gay either. And if they do start bible bashing, climb back into the closet. You never said anything explicitly incriminating, so they can't judge. Keep everything as vague as possible right now to those you don't want to know. Somedays, you'll feel the need to scream down a megahone ""I AM QUEER!"", but you have to hold it in for your safety. You never know if the homophobes will be abusive, so it's better safe than sorry.

Laser tag on the same team is great like Testicle_Kebabs said.  Scavenger hunt of cute things. Baking a cake together is so cute.

LGBTeens,3dspsp,placespromised,4,Sun Jul 19 02:19:16 2015 UTC,"I prefer to dress sort of punkish but I barely have any punk-type clothes because of money and i live pretty far from downtown where all the clothing stores that sell that kind of thing are.  Maybe but i don't really think so. I'm pan so I guess there isn't really an answer to that but I'm also trans which I guess influences how I'll never wear a dress or traditionally girly clothes. Also I've developed a hatred for V-necks but maybe after top surgery...idk.   3.Well my original gender definitely, but now that I figured out my actual gender, not at all!    I don't have much in the way of lgbt gear sadly but I do have a button I made that says ""Equality"" in all caps with a rainbow and an equal sign. Also I'm looking to get a shirt that says ""Mo' Homo"" but it's super expensive. I also have a really pink shirt that I wouldn't normally wear because I don't like pink but I keep it for Day of Pink."
LGBTeens,3dspsp,stuckinthisloop,4,Sun Jul 19 03:11:07 2015 UTC,"I prefer basics, nothing too fancy, although I will occasionally wear a dress. Chill stuff, like Kristen Stewart street clothes, most of the time (although I never look as good as her). I'd say that since I've come out as a lesbian, my style has become less feminine (mostly in an effort for people to know I'm gay, I was super lipstick before). I don't really feel uncomfortable in anything. Mens' clothes, womens' clothes, in-between clothes, it doesn't matter much to me. I do hate skirts, though. That's probably it. I have a couple bracelets and a headband, but I only wear them to Pride and LGBTQ events."
LGBTeens,3dspsp,emeraldfoxx,3,Sun Jul 19 03:49:39 2015 UTC,"I too, am more of a tomboy. I often wear graphic tees from the mens/unisex seciton, men's flannel, men's jeans, cargo shorts, and hoodies.  Eh, it's made me feel more comfortable dressing how I want, so I guess. Yes. I hate dresses/skirts/feminine clothing. I just don't feel or look right. Plus, I tend to be on the larger side of things, and if you've ever seen the majority of girls clothing well... It's very much meant for skinnier people.  Yes! I used to wear a bracelet I bought off amazon for a long time before it broke, then a bracelet my older sister made me, till that broke too... Now I wear a rainbow rubber bracelet I got from a local LGBT youth conference last year. I want another rainbow bracelet though, been meaning to make one myself for some time."

I do seem to get hyper aware of what im wearing when i find myself around a cute guy but... we all do that..right?   3: Noop  4:If i knew where to find something really subtle i would wear it. Im not out to my family and probably wont ever be able too so i couldnt wear something they would pick up on :/
LGBTeens,3dspsp,Alumin9,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:20:33 2015 UTC,I know an etsy shop that sells LGBTQ+ hemp twine bracelets. Pretty subtle in my opinion. :)
LGBTeens,3dspsp,starryeyedprincess,3,Sun Jul 19 09:30:13 2015 UTC,"1)I'm split down the middle! Some days I'm all flannels and jeans and others dresses. I definitely used to be more of a tomboy though. I've sort of grown out of it and into more of my own style though, I guess.  2) Definitely! I think it's less so my sexuality though, I more dress for whatever gender I'm hoping to attract, if that makes sense. For some reason if I know I'm gonna be around a bunch of potentially lgbt females, I go for something more androgynous. If there's a guy I like, I end up going waaaay more into the feminine stuff. I guess maybe that's not my sexuality, but it's somethin, right?  3) Definitely. I'm not comfortable showing a ton of skin and that's all a lot of ""female"" clothes want to do. It makes me super uncomfortable.  4)I wish. Way too deep in the closet (at least around my fam) for that."
LGBTeens,3dspsp,star_bomb,3,Sun Jul 19 07:47:57 2015 UTC,"I prefer dressing in very loose fitting clothing, preferably a t-shirt and sweatpants, mainly depending on the weather.

I can't stand wearing dresses or skirts, they bother me unconditionally. Actually, no! I wish I could get a wristband or two, maybe even a headband."
LGBTeens,3dspsp,Creame_Albino,2,Sun Jul 19 08:34:26 2015 UTC,"Casual, laidback. Mostly jeans/shorts and I pair it with a laidback shirt or a more feminine, dressy shirt. Not really?

Not at all. I just dress like that because I feel it suits me.   3.Sometimes, yes. It just looks so boring! I can never just wear something bright or happy, its always blue or black or grey. I'd love to have some nice pink clothes! =D  4.No, sadly not. I'm too nervous for that!"
LGBTeens,3dspsp,GrishaJaegerisBenjen,2,Sun Jul 19 09:27:16 2015 UTC,"dark blues and maroons as well as greys and black (occasionally cream). Buttoned up shirts, long plain pants and boots. Ummmm... I think so but I always like the look of those large jump suit like jackets girls wear (cream and zip up?) so I want to dress more gender neutral. No. No, if I could find something that I liked but I don't like rainbows (too much colour). I would maybe wear something blue and pink something that was bi?"
LGBTeens,3dspsp,Stickmanbren,2,Sun Jul 19 10:51:40 2015 UTC,"I always try to dress ""respectable"" since I'm kinda unsecury about my body, nothing to tight since that shows of your body shape and nothing to loose since it might reveal something. I don't think so, most people say I dress like a middle aged family man, lol. No though sometimes I wish I could wear some typical female clothes. Never, though if I saw a rainbow collared shirt I'd buy it."
LGBTeens,3dspsp,ValleDaFighta,2,Sun Jul 19 13:27:06 2015 UTC,"Neutral, though it usually translates to boyish. A lot of button up shirts, simple v-necks and sweaters and cardigans in neutral colours. Graphic tees are cool too. Somewhat oversized. Black skinny jeans are a must haha. Tbh I'd be more adventurous with clothes if I had the body type (I'm pretty short) but then again, this is comfortable. Possibly? I guess I'm not looking to appeal to anyone in particular so I don't pay as much attention to how others would prefer I dress? I feel strange wearing dresses/skirts/leggings. I don't think I'd ever wear a cropped top. Of course, female clothes aren't confined to those things-- so other than those, I don't really mind. Nope"
LGBTeens,3dspsp,udonchopstick,2,Sun Jul 19 15:31:08 2015 UTC,"Mostly sort of tomboyish, I consider Hannah Hart my style icon. I really like cargo pants and blazers. But I also like Indian skirts, peasant tops, and tie dye stuff. I have a sweater thing like this that I love. Not particularly. I don't really think about gender. It's more about whether I like     the clothes. I wear the occasional pride bracelet. I also really want a pair of rainbow knee socks."
LGBTeens,3dspsp,doctorpond11,2,Sun Jul 19 17:49:04 2015 UTC,"1) I usually dress pretty simple. Since graphic tees are hard to come by in Tall, I usually just go for flat colors (typically gray and black with a few bright colors mixed in). Cargo shorts most days unless it's a semi-formal event, then jeans and a button up shirt.  2) Not really. Unless a pink/coral watch band counts then maybe.   3) Style wise, never. Fitment, sometimes.

LGBTeens,3ds8ww,nghammond,20,Sat Jul 18 23:30:06 2015 UTC,"Well, did straight people choose to be straight? Do people choose who they fall in love with? I don't think so, and I also don't think it's a choice. The only choice I made regarding my sexuality was accepting it, and to be honest, in the world we live in, where LGBT people are sometimes treated in ways that are inhumane, would you choose, out of free will, to be gay? I wouldn't and I doubt many other people would, so I think it's not a choice at all, it's just who you are."
LGBTeens,3ds8ww,CynicalCommunist,7,Sat Jul 18 23:42:49 2015 UTC,My cousin and I had a great conversation about this. She also brought up the point about people choosing to bullied and harassed.
LGBTeens,3ds8ww,Whateverwhatever9,5,Sun Jul 19 00:23:43 2015 UTC,"Disagree with you on one bit. I would definitely choose to be bi if I had the option. After all, why wouldn't I? I live in a very accepting place. That depends largely on the place somebody lives."
LGBTeens,3ds8ww,Whateverwhatever9,11,Sun Jul 19 06:19:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's a choice, but I also don't think you're necessarily born with a sexual orientation. It just develops over the years."
LGBTeens,3ds8ww,burke828,3,Sun Jul 19 00:31:40 2015 UTC,Do you think you sexual orientation will develop based on your raising?
LGBTeens,3ds8ww,Hexomin,6,Sun Jul 19 00:38:08 2015 UTC,"It might affect it, but my parents raised me straight and we know how that turned out, lol."
LGBTeens,3ds8ww,arcanadran,5,Sun Jul 19 00:39:10 2015 UTC,"I was raised in a homophobic environment, but still think I am gay."
LGBTeens,3ds8ww,-Whyld-,2,Sun Jul 19 00:46:39 2015 UTC,I totally agree.
LGBTeens,3ds8ww,Definetelynottom,9,Sun Jul 19 02:18:58 2015 UTC,"First and foremost, it's critical to realize that whether or not being gay is a choice has no relevance to whether or not being gay is okay. being gay is okay because it doesn't hurt anyone and because people should have the freedom to do what they want in their private lives. Everyone should be able to express who they are, whether or not they chose to be that way.  That being said, the evidence is pretty overwhelming that it isn't a choice. Firstly, society is filled with homophobia; why would anyone choose to be gay? In relatively progressive areas of the world, it's not particularly hard being gay, though there is still some discrimination. However, in other places, being gay can get you killed. The fact that there are gay people in countries where homosexuality carries the death penalty is pretty clear evidence that it isn't a choice. Who would choose to be persecuted?  There is also biological evidence. There are various genes that have been linked with an increased likelihood of homosexuality. No single gene determines sexual orientation, but several affect it. The fact that genetics plays such a significant role is further evidence that it isn't something people choose. There are also twin studies. If one identical twin is gay, there's about a 50% chance that the other one will be too. If one fraternal twin is gay, there's only about a 25% chance. This difference between identical and fraternal twins is another reason to think that genetics play a large role in determining one's sexual orientation.  Finally, prenatal hormone levels also play a role, at least for males. The more older brothers a man has, the more likely he is to be gay. This seems to be because every male pregnancy changes the level of testosterone in the uterus for every subsequent pregnancy. We still aren't sure why this correlation occurs, but we know that it does. Also, this is true whether the siblings are raised together or apart, meaning that it's the biological factors, not the social ones which determine sexual orientation.  In short, people don't choose their sexual orientations. Sexual orientation seems to be largely determined by genetics and prenatal hormone exposure. Even if, however, people did choose to be gay, that wouldn't have any relevance as to whether or not being gay is okay."
LGBTeens,3ds8ww,DGxExcision,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:15:50 2015 UTC,"Couldn't say it better myself! Interesting fact, I believe that the pre-natal hormone levels probably contributed to me being gay since I have two older brothers."
LGBTeens,3ds8ww,burke828,6,Sun Jul 19 20:28:20 2015 UTC,"For me, I don't think it was much of a choice. I started noticing I was into girls at around age five, when I got all nervous and jittery around other girls, but fit right in with the boys at school...Suppressed it until the 7th grade, when it finally seemed to dawn on me, ""Oh, hey...I guess I'm gay."" And with it, came the denial. I thought I had the choice, so I told myself I was into guys. Took me another two years of faking my way through a few hetero relationships to realize that there was nothing really there, in terms of chemistry.  And then, my Juliet came along, and gave me a whole new perspective on life. It was the first relationship I'd been in that felt real; it felt right. I know others may not see it this way, but I personally don't think it's a choice. Shit just happens, y'know?"
LGBTeens,3ds8ww,emeraldfoxx,3,Sat Jul 18 23:51:01 2015 UTC,"I totally agree that shit just happens. I fit right in with the girls but when I am around other guys, I find my self flirting and having a desire to become more than friends with the guys."
LGBTeens,3ds8ww,lea_firebender,2,Sun Jul 19 00:26:34 2015 UTC,"I don't believe it is ever a choice. I can't comprehend wanting to be LGBT, it adds so much more difficulty to life. Although, bisexuality is kind of convenient for me, as I have only a few female friends."
LGBTeens,3ds8ww,ValleDaFighta,2,Sun Jul 19 11:11:54 2015 UTC,"I strongly disagree with that its a choice. In my family i was already having problems where my parents divorced, and are always fighting. Both of them are always saying things so i would be mad at the other one. I for sure wouldn't choose to make my life harder. Now yea there are other people with worse problems, but the same happens with them. Being gay is hard at the beginning because of coming out and all the homophobia, so no one would choose to actually make their lives harder."
LGBTeens,3ds8ww,smiley2990,2,Sun Jul 19 01:43:44 2015 UTC,This sums up my point of view exactly.
LGBTeens,3ds8ww,ahumblesloth,2,Sun Jul 19 02:01:21 2015 UTC,Its definitely not a choice but I personally am unsure of whether its born or socialized.
LGBTeens,3ds8ww,CptKinzo,2,Sun Jul 19 02:18:24 2015 UTC,"Not entirely sure, but from what I've read, it's mostly genetics and partially socialization. Either way, it's not something you can choose. Not many people would choose the harder way to live with the bulling, social stigma, inequality, and threatening that can come with it!"
LGBTeens,3ds8ww,VideoRyan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:41:33 2015 UTC,Neither is true of me. Pretty sure I was straight for the first 18 years of my life and then suddenly I found myself crushing on a girl. But I didn't choose to fall for her. It just.. happened.
LGBTeens,3ds8ww,sneakygingertroll,2,Sun Jul 19 05:18:01 2015 UTC,"Neither, it's a result of everything that's happened to you."
LGBTeens,3ds8ww,bizzenwoof,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:42:01 2015 UTC,"It's not a choice and your not born with any sexuality, but because of actions that happen in your life. You become: straight, gay, bisexual."

LGBTeens,3dqkg7,lukereid,3,Sat Jul 18 15:13:10 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean. I had been going through years of slowly being more comfortable around finding biological males attractive (in my mind I had just convinced myself that I was completely straight, just not a prude like most people), but the real tipping point was when my girlfriend told me that I was ""definitely some sort of queer"". So yeah. Praise nice girls who can reveal your inner gay."
LGBTeens,3ds2a1,KaossTheFox,3,Sat Jul 18 22:26:53 2015 UTC,"I asked a friend about this, for his thoughts. Echoing mine, he said that the guy should respect that you're not comfortable getting ""physical"" with him, instead waiting until you are. You should talk it over with any guy you might be involved with romantically.  I think that an emotional bond is more important than just sexual attraction, and I wouldn't want to be pressured into being physical either. It's not an unreasonable thing, but it could cause strain in a relationship."
LGBTeens,3ds2a1,Keniree,3,Sat Jul 18 22:53:08 2015 UTC,"So I've got two things to say that may help:  For a start, if you feel this way then there's a pretty damn good chance someone else has a similar orientation as you do. Being homoromantic without being homosexual. There's nothing stopping a homoromantic relationship from happening in this case, neither party would really be interested in physical stuff.   The other case is that a good relationship isn't based solely on physical attractions (they can start that way though). As long as you make your intentions clear then the other guy should be able to let you know if he's okay with that. I won't lie and say every guy would be but some will.   I guess a third point would be that as you said you could feel okay with physical stuff after you've already got a strong emotional connection (I think this is demisexual) but you'll have to figure out if that's the case for yourself! 😊"
LGBTeens,3ds2a1,Overwelm,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:58:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks, what you said is extremely helpful, along with what Keniree said. :)  I'm still kinda confused on this area though. I know for a complete fact that I'm biromantic, it's just I find it kinda hard to find a guy ""physically"" (I would say sexually, but I always feel weird saying that XP) attractive. Every once in a while I can find a guy ""physically"" attractive, but for me it's a lot easier for me to find a girl attractive like that.  (Although, considering I've been questioning my gender identity (and I'm usually attracted to people of my same gender), I almost wonder if it has something to do with that... idk, I've said too much anyway XD)"
LGBTeens,3ds2a1,emeraldfoxx,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:41:56 2015 UTC,"Take my advice with a grain of salt, as I've never been in your situation:  Definitely make it clear to him at the beginning of the relationship that you are not interested in the physical part. If he can't respect that, he isn't worth your time."
LGBTeens,3dr7k5,lukesher,6,Sat Jul 18 17:57:20 2015 UTC,"I'd go with the bigger one, as theres more chance of amazing sex theres a good chance that living with more people would help you with your anxiety, which in turn would help you with nearly everything in life!"
LGBTeens,3dr7k5,GrishaJaegerisBenjen,2,Sat Jul 18 21:19:39 2015 UTC,"My thought exactly, even the crossed out bit ;)"
LGBTeens,3dr7k5,Overwelm,2,Sat Jul 18 23:48:49 2015 UTC,"Though I do have to add on (as someone who lived with a fwb for 3 months, there is a big potential to get awkward if you hook up with people you live with and it doesn't go long term.. You also don't necessarily want to live with the people you hook up with, it means you don't have a place to go if anything happens badly.   But I agree 100% that living with more people will help with anxiety! Not only will you talk and interact with more people on a daily basis but they'll have things happening and talk about stuff with you that might help as well!"
LGBTeens,3dq0rc,iScenario,12,Sat Jul 18 09:21:30 2015 UTC,"Speaking from experience, nothing like this gets better over time. Tell him, tell him soon and be direct. With every day that passes the chance of him finding someone else grows. If you want to have a chance you need to take the initiative."
LGBTeens,3dq0rc,ValleDaFighta,7,Sat Jul 18 10:02:24 2015 UTC,"Yes! You have to bite the bullet and talk to him about this.  You're madly in love with your best friend.  Just by virtue of you already being such close friends, it is entirely possible that he feels the same way about you.  If you fall in love, it's a perfectly natural piece of news to share with your BFF.  It actually would be unnatural and could even be considered possibly divisive to your friendship to withhold such important information about yourself.    However, you are indeed in a bit of a pickle because of the details of your situation, and this is obviously causing you no small degree of anguish.  But that is okay.  Just because you talk about something doesn't mean it has to happen, right?  What if you started out having more of a general conversation about being in love?  Something more along the lines of a theoretical conversation about what happens when best friends fall in love, and what consequences that would have?  Such an interim step might be more comfortable for both of you, and provide a natural introduction for sharing your feelings of attraction for your friend with him.    Theoretically, nothing really changes after you share your honest feelings with him, if you are truly very good friends.  Only afterwards, if together you then decide you would like to try to pursue a romantic relationship with each other, would your status change.  Then, above all, communication is key.  I just watched this scenario play out with my gay teenage daughter and her bisexual best friend, who, recently became a couple.  As it turns out, each of them had been madly in love with the other for some time, but didn't want to say anything, at the risk of damaging their friendship and/or the other didn't feel the same way.  Incidentally, my daughter announcing that she now had a girlfriend was how she came out as gay.    As a mom who loves all of her children to pieces and prizes the level of commununication I strive to maintain with each of them, I have to tell you, it was A LOT easier to live with her after the dam broke!  TL;DR: Only big risks can reap big rewards."
LGBTeens,3dq0rc,a_pure_heart,2,Sat Jul 18 13:45:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for that. I'll definitely think about sorta being open about it to an extent so it doesn't push the limits at all. Best friends turning into best loves are great, so I've heard. And I'm sorta hoping that that can go through with my life as well because I can't imagine anyone else that suits me like he does. Thanks a lot! :)"
LGBTeens,3dq0rc,bizzenwoof,3,Sat Jul 18 19:30:48 2015 UTC,"I love this!! And I kinda had the same things happen but not as strong (and it's going on now). I just try to tell myself that we are just best friends but I fee like he is dropping hints. If he really is your absolute most trusted person ever then just be short and honest with him. Tell him exactly how you feel towards him. Hell, read him what you write to us! He might feel some of the same feelings and love you back. And since he is your bestie, what do you have to lose? If he is your best friend he will stay by you no matter what. If you wanna talk more about this email me or Kik me. Email: bizzenwoof@icloud.com Kik: bizzenwoof Good luck!"

LGBTeens,3dprka,OneYearSteakDay,8,Mon Jul 20 06:11:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not a member here, so I hope you'll pardon my dropping in.    I can't relate directly to your sexuality, but I can relate to the depression.  It sounds to me like you're telling yourself really depressing stories, which is a sure fire way to become depressed!    You start off apologizing.  Did you tell yourself we'd be offended if you asked for help?  Because we're not offended.  The story you told yourself made you believe we would be offended.  We all tell ourselves stories, some tell great stories of the things they will achieve and the wo/man they will become!  Others tell themselves stories that are somewhat less optimistic (I'm sure that I don't need to explain those stories to you.)    You say that your friends seems to hate you, as do the other gays in your community, but you're not sure why.  Are you sure that they actually hate you?  When I was a teen I would push people away so that they couldn't hurt me or break my heart, I would assume (Just as you have) that they already didn't like me so I didn't risk losing anything.  Reach out to your friends, let them be your friends.    Finally I'd like to leave you with a fact that you won't realize for years to come: The teenage brain is fucked up on hormones and neurotransmitters.  This isn't to say that your feelings are invalid so much as that your brain could be playing nasty tricks on you.  Your emotions still have some rough edges, but those will smooth with time.  :)    TL;DR: Stop telling yourself scary stories and ask for help if you need it, you will get through this I promise."

I have a binge eating problem that's led to me putting on a good amount of weight.

LGBTeens,3dp24z,henrylokv,10,Sat Jul 18 02:16:52 2015 UTC,"I made an alternate account to answer this cause I don't want it to connect back to me. But anyways... Yes. I was in the exact same boat as you, and still am actually. It was within the last month or two of school before summer and I was getting so frustrated about not ever being with a guy as Im not out yet and also don't know any other gay people my age except my best friend (Who may or may not think I'm straight, but would never be open to doing anything with) and I needed to do something, anything.  I got onto grindr (mind you Ive used grindr before for just chats and nothing else) and I put my name to horny and my age to 18, where I live though you can consent at 16. Sure enough I was getting messages right away from all sorts of people and it was really weird. I started talking to someone who looked good (never got to see face just body) and thought they seemed pretty cool.  So I live in a smallish town and was super scared about showing my face to someone I didn't know in fear of them knowing me and then outing me. I made sure not to show myself at all... maybe just a naughty pic here and there. So it escalated pretty fast and before you know it the guy messages me saying that he might know who I am....  Im freaking the fuck out.... I was honestly crying in my room thinking about what I just did, didn't even want to look at grindr in fear of him blackmailing me or some shit. The next day I go onto my chat and he says that he shouldn't have just said it like that and then throughout that say he starts telling me how he is in the closet to and he is older and that he actually has a family with kids but has divorced his wife because of other reasons. He said he's just as scared as me because he loves his kids and all that.  So you might be thinking ""This kid is weird af, he's talking to a grown man who's divorced with kids and wants a little action even though he's 17"".. your right now that I look back at it but I had all that sexual frustration driving me absolutely insane.   We eventually learn who each other are and turns out we actually knew each other, he coached my sports team when I was a wee lad. I told him I can't handle it anymore and wanted to meet. We did... we did some things, nothing to crazy though since Im not a complete crazy nut.   And honestly the only way I can describe it is ""meh"". I wouldn't ever do it again until I'm away at university in another city and can live a life I want. I was stupid, made a mistake but didn't turn out so bad. I was lucky. Hold off until sexual frustration isn't the only thing pressuring you unless you will look back on it and think ""meh"" or make a more serious mistake."
LGBTeens,3dp24z,LGBTeensalt,9,Sat Jul 18 06:07:23 2015 UTC,"I used Grindr for like two weeks and then I deleted it for a few reasons. One is that I clearly stated that I didn't want to be messaged by people older than a certain age, but that didn't matter for many 50 year olds, so yeah. The other reason is that you get all this cool features for a while, like filters, and then suddenly they're gone and you have to pay for it and all those creepy 50 year olds I didn't want to talk to at all started to appear on the feed.  And even the ones that weren't 50 and sent me messages I usually ignored. So you can say I didn't really like Grindr, but you can always try it, it doesn't really hurt :)"

Let him know that you'll be there for him and support him and let him know he is not alone and stuff.. He may not be able to handle a relationship right now if he can barely manage his existence/emotions in general, but he could possibly really use that support and helpfulness.

LGBTeens,3dpv3v,Pamander,3,Sat Jul 18 07:57:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah of course anytime, he could definitely be into you and maybe down the road you two could have an amazing relationship, but for now just be there for him and randomly check in on him to see how he's feeling, leave him nice messages to cheer him up, various little things, be his rock if you can, that could mean the world and his life for him, I know it has for me with people in my life.  You're a great person to support him in this time, it can't be easy but it's something not easily forgotten and it's a really great thing to do :)  I am really glad that you are getting where I am coming from and thank you for enjoying the advice, I hope everything goes well and as I said if you ever need anything just feel free to PM me!"
LGBTeens,3dpv3v,Pamander,3,Sat Jul 18 08:01:16 2015 UTC,One more question since I'm kinda awkward with this stuff.. I don't want to keep sending him texts without him responding but I also really want to support him. So should I just wait to see if he ever texts me back? and if he doesn't should I just take the hint and not try to support him anymore?
LGBTeens,3dpv3v,burke828,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:19:18 2015 UTC,"Depending on the last message you sent maybe hit him up with one last message of ""Hey I haven't heard from you in awhile and I know you said you were depressed, I was just worrying about you and I just wanted you to know that I will always be here if you ever need someone to talk too or just listen even, I hope you're doing ok (insert their name here)."" and if they don't respond to that, you might should just try to put him in your past because maybe they aren't interested and they just had a horrible excuse for it, but in the case that they were telling the truth, it's best you try all the avenues for trying to help them, and it's really sweet that you are :) I wish you the best of luck and I hope it goes well for you, and if it doesn't, we have tons of amazing people in this community that might just be a perfect other half for you :D"
LGBTeens,3dpv3v,ItLikesMe,2,Sat Jul 18 16:15:49 2015 UTC,Either he doesn't like you or hes depressed. Don't bother him about romance but try to be supportive.
LGBTeens,3do9fa,sneakygingertroll,17,Fri Jul 17 22:02:24 2015 UTC,You will only regret the chance you never took.
LGBTeens,3do9fa,Shindynamo,8,Fri Jul 17 22:04:57 2015 UTC,i would regret my entire school knowing im gay.  But what you say is true
LGBTeens,3do9fa,Shindynamo,2,Fri Jul 17 22:07:17 2015 UTC,Don't mention that just confront him as if you never knew.
LGBTeens,3do9fa,Shindynamo,2,Fri Jul 17 23:02:43 2015 UTC,But how? I probably won't have a class with this guy next year and I never talk to him.  Our social groups are very different
LGBTeens,3do9fa,Overwelm,2,Sat Jul 18 01:28:51 2015 UTC,Well you're already 4 years late you might as well just like a normal human go up and say hi. Make it clear you like him or become his friend and ask him.
LGBTeens,3do9fa,MysteryMoniker,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:33:29 2015 UTC,As /u/shindynamo said you might as well just go talk to him and say hi. If you like him you'll have to do it eventually. Don't make an assumption that he's gay when you do just go talk to him and try and become friends.

LGBTeens,3do9fa,Keniree,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:21:47 2015 UTC,"i would but   i dont know what i would even say i think that even if he is gay i still creep him out/he will block me im not out, so how is he supposed to know that its me (i dont want to lead him on and then tell him who it is because i think that might go badly) how am i supposed to find out if its really him? His location, name (only first name), age, height, weight, and ethnicity match, but i still think im getting my hopes up."
LGBTeens,3do9fa,intheirbadnessreign,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:35:36 2015 UTC,"I would say go ahead and message him. If he isn't then no big deal and if he is then you find out if he has a crush on you or not. Also, if that much information matches it's probably him ¯_(ツ)_/¯"
LGBTeens,3dosv6,jakeycox,2,Sat Jul 18 00:52:28 2015 UTC,You won't find anyone by waiting. If you want someone you need to tell them. It doesn't have to be a big deal.
LGBTeens,3dosv6,ValleDaFighta,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:06:04 2015 UTC,"I just don't know if I'm ready to come out yet and go for the guy, and the girl that I like isn't at all interested in me, at least it doesn't feel like it."
LGBTeens,3dosv6,bizzenwoof,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:41:54 2015 UTC,"Weather or not the cute guy on the soccer team is gay he seems like if you came out to/for him he would be okay with it. I would just tell him that you are gay and that he is the only person at school who knows and if he is okay with that (doesn't seem awkward) then follow it up with the fact that you like him. I'm guessing that you are in high school. There, you have nothing to lose. If he doesn't like you back, maybe you can just be best friends! Who knows. I wish you the best of luck and keep us updated. If you wanna talk more about this feel free to Kik me. Kik: bizzenwoof"
LGBTeens,3dosv6,bizzenwoof,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:14:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I think I might try that, maybe get to know him a little better first tho..... But seriously, thanks! Finally putting coming out as an option :)"
LGBTeens,3dnnay,lukesher,14,Fri Jul 17 19:12:20 2015 UTC,"Ya I'm actually studying secondary education mathematics in college! Last semester (high school) I was a teacher's aid for an algebra 1 class and they loved me, the teacher let me take over a couple days, so I got to be acting teacher and it was wonderful. Also glad I did that cuz that's how I met my crush ;)"
LGBTeens,3dnnay,Sweepy01,5,Fri Jul 17 20:39:59 2015 UTC,Thats awesome! I feel like I'd be kind of creepy because id keep crushing on the year 11s unless age changes who you're attracted to.
LGBTeens,3dnnay,Sweepy01,4,Fri Jul 17 21:22:10 2015 UTC,"Nah, I mean I was a senior (year 12?) and he was actually a sophomore (year 10?) but age doesn't matter to me that much... Idk I feel kinda creepy having a crush on him but it's not like I can help it lol. But for now we're good friends"
LGBTeens,3dnnay,MysteryMoniker,2,Fri Jul 17 21:33:40 2015 UTC,The way I think of it is in 20 years a 2 year difference doesn't matter so its not at all creepy
LGBTeens,3dnnay,MysteryMoniker,13,Sat Jul 18 12:11:49 2015 UTC,"I would love to go into teaching, but probably only after a couple decades in industry.   And as a point seriously, seriously don't go into teaching for the reasons you stated. Teaching is a job to make the next generation the best they can be: you're not there just to be another student. If all you want is the teenage drama, teaching Is not for you."
LGBTeens,3dnnay,MysteryMoniker,2,Fri Jul 17 23:58:08 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean, its not just for the drama, I want to help students who are in the same boat as me as in the students who have home trouble or are closeted or depressed or something, I only had one teacher in highschool I could vaguely talk to and even then she was too distant to talk to.  I'd like to teach but havent gone down the right path."
LGBTeens,3dnnay,MysteryMoniker,2,Sat Jul 18 12:15:44 2015 UTC,"If helping student is what you want, become a school counsellor - the good thing about that is often you can work part time in conjunction with another counsellor, so you'd still be able to earn a living."
LGBTeens,3dnnay,Excham,2,Sat Jul 18 12:23:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guess but I still want to teach them in a proper way. The majority of teachers are quite bland and I want to br that teacher who actually makes learning fun instead of just ""watch this video"" as one of my old teachers did every lesson."
LGBTeens,3dnnay,GrishaJaegerisBenjen,2,Sat Jul 18 12:29:06 2015 UTC,"That's fair enough, I understood what you meant initially, it's just that being the ""cool"" teacher should never come above actualy being good at teaching."
LGBTeens,3dnnay,KRamkishun,2,Sat Jul 18 12:33:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah it definitely wouldnt but like I said I cant do anything about it because I havent gone down the right path, I mean no one needs a teachers who spent 6 years in art school.  As I typed that out I realised that its completely possible to be an art teacher...."
LGBTeens,3dnnay,adrael_,2,Sat Jul 18 12:44:51 2015 UTC,"Haha yup. And the great thing about teaching art is there is a lot more room to be ""cool"" - since its a subject where you basically let the kids do whatever task you set them that lesson you can stick on some music and natter a little, so long as they actually get the work done.   For example, my GCSE art teacher was constantly bantering with us. He'd constantly slag off the other art teacher, who happened to be head of art, as well as mock us (it's an all boys private school we gave back as good as we got) and we'd always have a laugh (he would go on about FIFA a tad much tho...)."
LGBTeens,3dnnay,ValleDaFighta,2,Sat Jul 18 13:03:48 2015 UTC,"He sounds like a pretty cool teacher. My photography teacher was kind of the same, he would joke about coming round to my house to find my camera because I kept losing it, he was awesome."
LGBTeens,3dnnay,ValleDaFighta,7,Sat Jul 18 14:08:53 2015 UTC,Hahaha! I had the exact same thought a few months ago! I think being a teacher would be an awesome job!
LGBTeens,3dnnay,ValleDaFighta,4,Fri Jul 17 19:54:22 2015 UTC,"Definitely!! I want to be the cool teacher who everyone likes and gets on with. Although in real life Iife I'm awful with people, ao ita never happening!"

LGBTeens,3dnnay,CynicalCommunist,3,Sat Jul 18 23:35:01 2015 UTC,"Teaching was always something I considered, but with my degree choice (Ancient History) it limits where I can teach. I think I'm going to go degree-level education and become uni staff!"
LGBTeens,3dnnay,CynicalCommunist,3,Fri Jul 17 23:17:35 2015 UTC,I'd like to be a history teacher because the way history is thaught in Sweden is awful.
LGBTeens,3dnnay,CynicalCommunist,3,Sat Jul 18 10:08:42 2015 UTC,How do they teach it?
LGBTeens,3dnnay,SmexyPenguin18,2,Sat Jul 18 12:22:38 2015 UTC,Basically we skip huge parts of important history and focus on small non-important parts.
LGBTeens,3dnnay,SmexyPenguin18,2,Sun Jul 19 07:40:11 2015 UTC,I didnt like history in school because it was all modern history when I prefer ancient history but that sounds a lot worse
LGBTeens,3dnnay,krocketable,2,Sun Jul 19 09:41:26 2015 UTC,"We had:  Ancient history: Go over the roman empire in like 3 classes.  Medieval history: Go over feudalism in 3 classes, the black death in 3 classes and finally the age of discovery in 2 classes.  An entire month dedicated to Martin Luther and the protestant reformation because lutheranism, fuck yeah.  One week on absolutism.  A few classes on the french & american revolutions.  A few weeks on the industrialism, imperialism and ww1.  No one learned anything because we couldn't connect any event to anything. We jumped over things such as the colonization of the americas and the rise of nationalism in favor of entire classes dedicated to the french kings attempted escape from paris and jack the ripper. It was awful and you could see how the teacher didn't want to do it like that."
LGBTeens,3dp3vi,michigandiscusbball,2,Sat Jul 18 02:33:35 2015 UTC,Have you checked under your pillows? If your bed is against a wall you could check between your bed and the wall. I can't think of much else off the top of my head.
LGBTeens,3dp3vi,OffensiveVias,2,Sat Jul 18 02:40:20 2015 UTC,I've checked under my pillows. I've tried checking in the area between there and I couldn't find it immediately but I can't see much because it's so dark.

LGBTeens,3dp3vi,TheLivingNarwhal,3,Sat Jul 18 02:46:16 2015 UTC,Alright. My mom's done that before. I have a five year old brother and I suspect he took it. And when I lost it it was at like 10 percent so it's most likely dead right now.

I hear a lot of homophobic slurs on nearly a daily basis from both opponents, teammates, and sometimes even coaches. It really bothers me, and I let it get into my head almost every time. It's nice to know that anyone can change though and I'll keep your story in mind when I hear homophobic shit on the field"

LGBTeens,3dl6nq,NewGamma,12,Fri Jul 17 04:07:08 2015 UTC,I went through an intense biphobic phase.  It's definitely a thing.
LGBTeens,3dl6nq,evknight,7,Fri Jul 17 04:30:58 2015 UTC,Same. I distinctly remember saying that bisexuality is just a name for indecisive people when I was like 12. And look where I am now
LGBTeens,3dl6nq,sagittarius97,6,Fri Jul 17 04:38:22 2015 UTC,"Interestingly enough, I went through a bi only phase. I would insist that I liked guys and girls, watch straight porn, and make homophobic jokes with my friends."

LGBTeens,3dl6nq,monkey_gamer,5,Fri Jul 17 06:07:12 2015 UTC,"It's people trying to repress their identities. They don't want to be gay/bi, so they go to the opposite extreme."
LGBTeens,3dl6nq,transandpans,4,Fri Jul 17 06:47:16 2015 UTC,"exactly! during this phase, when i thought I was dressing to gay, I only wore a gray hoodie and jeans for months. When I noticed I would do the limp wrist occasionally, I kept my hands in my pockets almost full time. I tried to talk deeper to mask my feminine voice. But then at the end of the day, i would always go back to gay porn, and hate myself for it. Wow my life has changed so much for the better."
LGBTeens,3dl6nq,syzithryx,0,Fri Jul 17 16:30:00 2015 UTC,"You don't have to be girly in order to be gay though. You can be masculine if that's what you like. I mean, I don't understand why you think enjoying gay porn is antagonistic to acting masculine...?"
LGBTeens,3dl6nq,doctorpond11,2,Sat Jul 18 01:22:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying you have to be feminine, I'm saying that I am feminine and I tried to hide it.

LGBTeens,3dl6nq,CompleteGeek,3,Sat Jul 18 02:15:14 2015 UTC,"Yes. My entire childhood. My parents weren't homophobic or anything, they're super accepting. I just knew nothing about LGBT anything.

LGBTeens,3dl6nq,Neddy93,2,Fri Jul 17 23:21:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah no I did. Heavily. I was even against marriage equality and so many other things, until I found out that being gay is ok and started creating my own opinions. Now I couldn't imagine being any other way.

Later, when I was about 13, I grew out of it, but I still thought of myself as straight (I tried to force myself to be asexual, but what a shock, it didn't work).

LGBTeens,3dk0qq,flamewheel56,5,Sat Jul 18 03:10:54 2015 UTC,"Okay, I like Caitlyn Jenner. But she DOES. NOT. DESERVE. THIS. AWARD.  Caitlyn is NOT a hero. You know who's a hero? The transgender teen who's bullied and beaten up all the time in school for being who they are, but sticks it in the face of their persecutors. That's a hero.  You know who else is a hero? The young girl dying of brain cancer who stays positive right until the very end.  Lauren should have gotten this award. Not some spoiled rich woman who has not had to endure any sort of REAL struggle over her identity in the public eye.  I'm sorry if this offends somebody, it's just the way I feel."
LGBTeens,3dk0qq,syzithryx,17,Fri Jul 17 00:26:41 2015 UTC,"She still faced a lot of hatred and confusion growing up, and the transition, the hate online she and her family took online, was a lot to bear. Courageous- maybe not as much as Lauren but still. And Arthur Ashe was no. 1 about civil rights/tolerance, half the country doesn't hate amputees."
LGBTeens,3dk0qq,Kakarot_faps,6,Fri Jul 17 00:47:43 2015 UTC,"The award is for courage by an athlete, not for athletes standing up for civil rights. It takes much more courage to die with a smile than to be a celebrity enduring a bit of hate, which they have to deal with anyway. I can't pretend to really know what she was going through, but a voice in my mind screams ""PUBLICITY STUNT"" whenever I see her these days. Not the transgender thing - the making a big fuss about it. She doesn't have to go on every last show and magazine cover flaunting herself. She could have just done it privately and made some statements on LGBT websites or something - instead it seems as if she's trying to use her transgender status to get even more famous. Like she's devaluing the very culture she's a member of by using it as a ladder to greater fame."
LGBTeens,3dk0qq,syzithryx,4,Fri Jul 17 00:56:53 2015 UTC,"As she and I will say - it is making the older generation who loved Bruce more willing to accept their kids, and she serves as someone who can do the ""I can do it so can you"" for kids. Having more public trans figures will help it's acceptance in the mainstream. I never watched the kardashian crap E! puts out, I never will. And I think it's garbage TV. But it was still a lot more hate than Bruce would've ever gotten had he stayed a man. Celebrities are still people, who care about issues, and not every action is about fame. Those were real tears and real feelings - i don't think anyone would transition just for fame. Watch the video, they address this concern - she wanted to keep it private but after hearing about the suicides and killings she couldn't. And you can't hide that from paparazzi."

LGBTeens,3dk0qq,Darkbeast36,12,Thu Jul 16 22:52:16 2015 UTC,No one cares. The award itself isn't important. It's what she said that is.
LGBTeens,3dk0qq,thistokenusername,6,Thu Jul 16 22:57:02 2015 UTC,"This comment really didn't add to what I said. I didn't say anything negative about Ms. Jenner. I just don't know why she won.   If somebody could tell me why she won, instead of just down voting me like I said something bad, I would appreciate it."
LGBTeens,3dk0qq,Darkbeast36,11,Thu Jul 16 23:26:17 2015 UTC,"You can see how misunderstood Transgender people and issues still are in society. For her to come out and be herself against those who would mis-gender her constantly, fail to even acknowledge the name Caitlyn or send general hate (all of which we saw on twitter/reddit/facebook/the news.) That takes a lot of courage.   And I think that courage especially is good for many younger transgender people as it can be inspiring to see someone in the public eye that they can identify with when there still aren't enough."
LGBTeens,3dk0qq,SingingSongs26,0,Thu Jul 16 23:51:31 2015 UTC,"That's a good point. I never really thought about it that way. She definitely deserves to be recognized for her courage and impact on youth in general.   I think my main issue is her courage is being seen as more important or more impacting than other people. Being around this sub for a while, I have grown accustomed to many brave people dealing with sexuality, body comfort, and even social acceptance. It never dawned on me that people are still getting around to accepting transsexual people. I'm not taking away from the fact that she is brave, I just don't like one kind of courage being singled out as better than another kind.  Thank you for taking the time to write your answer out for me. I really appreciate the perspective I gained from you. I also apologize if I offended you or anybody else."

LGBTeens,3dl8rg,justoboy,10,Fri Jul 17 04:27:56 2015 UTC,A few questions:   How old are you?   Are your parents accepting of LGBT people?   Are your parents accepting of specifically trans people?   These kind of affect what kind of advice we can give you.
LGBTeens,3dl8rg,transandpans,3,Fri Jul 17 06:49:33 2015 UTC,"Sorry i didn't put that in the post.....  I'm 17 years old and my parents, well some of them, are accepting of LGBT people. My mother is fine with me dating anyone, I came out as being bi to her earlier in the year. She is also acceptant of trans people. My mom told me that before I was born she talked to my dad about what if the baby wanted to change. I still haven't told her anything, I only told one close friend."
LGBTeens,3dl8rg,transandpans,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:36:36 2015 UTC,"Alright. What you'll want to do from here depends on whether or not you want to start transitioning right away. Your mom seems like she could be a good support, so coming out to her could help you begin your transition sooner rather than later. But if you want to wait to transition, you can decide not to come out yet. Personally, I want to transition as soon as I possibly can, so chances are you do too. In that case, coming out is pretty much a necessity because you need parental consent to take hormones (unless you DIY, which is unsafe).  So if you think you'd be safe coming out and you'd like to begin your transition, it would be in your best interest to come out to your mom."
LGBTeens,3dl8rg,Scurfdonia00,3,Fri Jul 17 18:09:14 2015 UTC,"Try going to /r/MtF. Seeing all the women there may help you get a feeling of community and support.   Now, where to start. Hm. To be honest, I'm FtM, so our steps are a bit different than yours, but I can try to give you some advice. Let's see...   If your parents are accepting of transgender people: Tell them you're transgender. From there you can talk about going to a gender therapist and getting the support you need. Depending on how old you are, you may be able to get hormones.   In the meantime, you could buy a couple of things to help you out, such as makeup (head on over to /r/makeupaddiction for some help. I have heard that they're very trans friendly). If you don't like or want makeup, then you don't have to wear it. Not all girls do. :)   Other things... Hm. You could go to a shop, get some feminine clothing! If you don't want to spend a whole lot of money, or are nervous, try going to a thrift shop first. People in thrift shops generally don't pay attention to what others are doing (and honestly people in larger stores don't pay attention either). Also, buying a bra may be fun, even if it doesn't fit. And some cute underwear. Trust me, those under things really can affect your mental health. I personally feel so much better about myself when I wear masculine underwear.  Also, buying some hair accessories, or using someone else's! Things like barrettes or headbands or ribbons! You can use those, even with short hair. Growing out your hair will probably also help.   That's all I can think of right now, based on the information you provided in your post (which wasn't a whole lot). If you have any other questions, feel free to ask me, or head on over to /r/asktransgender or /r/ask_transgender."

Im not necessarily directing my comments towards op since you did the right thing and got the fuck out of there. But I'm going to go all 90's internet safety PSA on you and anyone reading this anyway and say you should NEVER send ANY nudes or otherwise very sexual pictures of yourself until you are above the legal age of consent, wether or not your face is in the frame. They still count as child pornography and get what ever dickhole and what ever unlucky bustards s/he passes them onto in major trouble and possibly a criminal record; whether or not they deserve one. And the other side of the ""internet is a dangerous place"" spectrum is that you never know who you're talking to until you meet them in person, and that's not always the safest route either. There's always the possibility that the guy you were talking too were an old creep looking for pictures of pretty boys and using selfies off someone else's tumblr blog as an alias. Whether they ended up being a creepy grandpa, who knows. The good thing is the fact that you followed your gut. Always trust the gut, it's always better to be suspicious and paranoid than it is to instantly trust everybody you talk to. You never owe anyone anything and you are 1000% in the right when you say it's your own body. I'm glad you held your own and found a way out of there. You never need to stay in situations that make you uncomfortable, who cares if that makes you a party pooper."

There are always going to be new people in your life who you may need to come out to. Don't think of it as something with a definite end.

LGBTeens,3dczt7,cheesestrings76,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:03:03 2015 UTC,I'm very new to the terms asexual and aromantic.. How did/do you feel about romance with your boyfriend? It must be somewhat different if you don't like touching or did I misunderstand something?
LGBTeens,3dczt7,Ra5han,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:44:48 2015 UTC,"From what I have experienced, sexual attraction is different from romantic attraction.  Romantic attraction is the emotional response to a person.  I liked being around him and spending my time with him and being affectionate with him.  I did not know how to define sexual attraction at least, until someone described it as being hungry and having a plate of your favorite food sitting in front of you, and wanting to eat it.  Honestly, I've never wanted to ravage anybody, or have it done to me, gentle caress, or whatever.  Not even kissing.  It was always emotionally based for me.  I am capable of being romantically attracted to men, and I find them aesthetically pleasing-- but the romantic attraction is always at the forefront.    I was not tipped off about the asexuality until I tried doing stuff with my second boyfriend and I felt disgusted with myself.  Even with my previous boyfriend before that, I felt a similar feeling, but just ended it before I could really think about it.  No matter how much I cared about him and trusted him, it was always disgust with myself when the matter came to sex.  Masturbation by myself is okay, and I have certain fantasies, but the thought of actually doing anything with any of them or of just normal sex sounds awful.  That probably makes so little sense haha.  I cannot fathom what it is like for a person to lose themselves in lust toward another willing person.  Kind of wish I did, it must be pretty exciting.  :P  But oh well"
LGBTeens,3dczt7,Ra5han,2,Wed Jul 15 14:04:30 2015 UTC,"That's really interesting! How did your boyfriend respond to your feelings? I'm sure there must be a small percentage of people out there who might not care very much about sex, but I think that people at our age won't let it go that fast. I don't think that you'll be alone forever though; doing that takes effort"
LGBTeens,3dczt7,Ra5han,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:12:59 2015 UTC,"He was willing to wait for me to be ready for sex, but I ended the relationship because I did not want to give him that impression.  I knew I would never want to be intimate with him like that, so I broke it off to avoid pulling him along.  I say that like it was a simple thing, but it was terribly sad.    Honestly, I'll not even consider dating another person unless they're asexual.  ):  It's just there aren't many asexual people out there, so the chances of me being alone are pretty high."

I might as well have been talking to myself, which I do some amount of the time, and he came to exactly the same conclusions that I already had.  So all in all, not exactly helpful."

LGBTeens,3d83fi,Excham,8,Tue Jul 14 06:26:39 2015 UTC,"well,  since he has a girlfriend in the past, probs a pretty good chance that he is not gay. Maybe he's bi. But as far as you can do is confess, and if is a true friend, he will accept, and having a homophobic friend is never the way to go.  So tell him and see how it goes, probs not gay. once you are out and hopefully he does accept you, things will be better. Sucks having a crush i know.. Best of luck man."
LGBTeens,3d83fi,ItLikesMe,6,Tue Jul 14 07:00:51 2015 UTC,Yeah.... The last thing I want to do is be dishonest... And I know he'll be accepting... But there's that voice in my head telling me he won't be... ._.  I guess I'll just have to man up...

LGBTeens,3d83fi,Pandelol,7,Tue Jul 14 07:37:49 2015 UTC,"/u/excham confessing to his crush can possibly make things between them pretty weird and maybe he doesn't even want to hang often anymore and he doesn't even have to be homophobic to react that way.  I think it's saver to just come out to him and hope that if he is gay or bi this gives him the strength and trust in you to come out aswell, If not you have to try and forget about the crush even when it's hard."

LGBTeens,3d83fi,DhakaWolf,5,Wed Jul 15 08:14:46 2015 UTC,"If I were you I'd come out to him before asking him out or whatever. If he's gay or bi he'll probably spill the beans right away, and you can take it from there i'm sure."
LGBTeens,3d83fi,YoungQueen97,2,Tue Jul 14 10:51:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly to me these are one of those damned if you do, damned if you don't situations.

But I mean if you do at least you'd be able to look back and say you tried and that's really all you can do. Hell I've never had the nerve to confront any of my straight crushes so if you do, major props."
LGBTeens,3d83fi,TheConservativeForce,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:05:25 2015 UTC,If he dated the chick for 18 months that's is kinda a long time...

LGBTeens,3d7i40,Kid9399,5,Tue Jul 14 03:02:59 2015 UTC,"You could be transgender. You might be binary MtF (male to female), or you could be nonbinary. You could just enjoy thinking about being female. Gender is a spectrum, and possibly fluid. I suggest you spend some time thinking about how you feel. Do you feel like a woman? Or do you feel somewhere in between man and woman? Or do you just enjoy the thought of appearing female? The answers to those questions will help you determine your identity. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me. I'm FtM transgender and could probably help you.  Also. Transgender is not a noun. It is an adjective. Using transgender as a noun can be dehumanizing. So, instead of saying ""Transgenders"" or ""a transgender"", say "" transgender people"" or ""a transgender person"". :)"

LGBTeens,3d7i40,Scurfdonia00,4,Tue Jul 14 04:08:58 2015 UTC,"It's okay! I see a lot of people doing that, so it isn't surprising to see others. Just thought I'd clear it up.  And no problem I can answer your question. I was 14 when I realized I was transgender. However, there were signs going back into my early childhood. I just didn't have the information to identify them.   Side note. I have never felt that I was born in the ""wrong body"". Some transgender people do, but many don't. This body that I have is my body, and some parts may feel wrong, but my entire body is not wrong. :)"
LGBTeens,3d7i40,Scurfdonia00,3,Tue Jul 14 04:21:26 2015 UTC,Thank you!! Through puberty my thought process changed and like something clicked and all these emotions and thoughts came into my head

LGBTeens,3d7i40,becarefulhavefun,3,Tue Jul 14 04:31:30 2015 UTC,"15, and you saying that makes me feel so relived. I thought a lot of transgender felt like they were in the wrong body since they were younger"

I did have another IRL, but he was always an asshole really and has moved to London. He has come back down twice, but I get the feeling that it's more to see his shitty girlfriend rather than me (he's 18 and they're fucking engaged.). he even has me blocked on Facebook for some reason now sigh  It really sucks. I get jealous at a lot of the posts on here, even the ""I dont know if I my friend is gay, help!"" ones because I have never even gotten into that situation. Not having any IRL friends and seeing everyone with their happy, pictures of the hanging out and posts about their relationships just makes me want to bury my head in my arms.  Sucks man, I totally understand you. Being 18 doesn't help."
LGBTeens,3d5lbe,Sherk-,4,Mon Jul 13 18:39:20 2015 UTC,"It really does suck, I deleted my facebook and stopped going on instagram since there was really no point and I only would get angry looking at everyone bragging about everything and anything.

Sometimes it's not even a matter of shyness, but just not knowing what to do or say. Like an extreme social ineptitude. Don't really have any online friends either as I don't really play any online games, just an overabundance of WW2 strategy games. I don't think I'm lonely though, I quite happily fill my time reading and watching films and such."

LGBTeens,3d5lbe,Ididntknowwehadaking,2,Tue Jul 14 05:39:29 2015 UTC,"When I moved to college, I basically lost all my friends from back home. So I effectively became friendless. I actually didn't mind it that much and I started to feel much better with all this newfound independence. I spend most of my time working, studying, reading, doing me and it's quite fulfilling. I have no desire to make new friends at this point.  There's nothing wrong with being alone, just make sure you're not losing social skills and isolating yourself completely from society. I have a number of 'buddies' (not 'friends'), I meet people, I go out, I meet new guys, etc. There are plenty of positives to learning to be independent at a young age (17-18) and learning to do things by yourself, embrace it :)   EDIT: This. The rest of the thread is pretty great too."
LGBTeens,3d5lbe,Ididntknowwehadaking,2,Mon Jul 13 23:11:29 2015 UTC,"I honestly didn't think it was this common. I have not had a single "" friend "" since i was 9.  Nobody i can hang out with or talk to. Just me and myself. I mean my life isn't boring, i have plenty to do and really don't have to worry about anything.   I don't even know how to make friends. I never got the social skills everyone else did. I was 4'9 all through middle school and got picked on for being short ( which is funny because i run into people every now and then and I'm taller than them which i find hilarious ), and as a result i just distanced myself from everyone. I can talk to people and hold conversations but i cant get a damn topic to talk about.    Some of us can deal with being alone. Is it lonely every once and a while? absolutely. But thats just how life is."
LGBTeens,3d5lbe,CynicalCarrots,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:12:25 2015 UTC,"I had a single friend up until I was 12 (we met at 2) and she ditched me in the 6th grade, all that time with just having one friend screwed me up socially so I wasn't able to make friends in middle school, I was picked on for being a 'faggot' (I wasn't even out yet and I wasn't even sure if I was gay) and I pretty much just pulled away into myself. I was never particularly lonely or in need of friends, but occasionally I would be.  Basically what I'm trying to say is that are situations are similar yet different, and I know where you are coming from. It's really surprising to see how many people have commented saying that they are in the same position, kinda comforting in an odd way I guess."
LGBTeens,3d5lbe,RexThunderstorm,2,Tue Jul 14 01:42:12 2015 UTC,"So I know this is lgbteens but as an older dude (22) I might actually have some tips for everyone,   so yes going to college you lose most of your old friends, as much as you wanna say we are bffffffs and will never drift apart, it just sort of happens, and in college I freaked out at the idea that my college friends will most likely disappear as well.   However college is a time to grow up, become an adult and realize the only thing holding me back is me, sure people and crowds are scary, but being alone sucks so much more, if you don't have social skills and use it as an excuse, realize that we humans learn social skills easily, it takes time but as you socialize more and more things come easier to you.    I am an introvert, I'm awkward, I'm scrawny, I love robots, and science, and video games, I run a 7.5min mile and am gay. However I have made several friends who either share those same qualities or interests and they are the best friends I've ever had, we've gotten drunk, fought, made our ancestors proud, and then played smash bros all in one night, one of my most favorite nights ever.  What I am saying is, don't wait as long as I did (now a senior) join a group, find hobbies, join your schools lgbt group, if you live on campus go to your RAs events, most RAs are extremely sociable and would love to meet you or help you meet people, find a group on meetup etc   I guess I am begging you all to not wait until its to late, I have maybe a year left with my friends before we part ways for grad school but I will never forget them and the fun times we've had, please do yourself a favor, don't just do well in school and get good grades, meet people and have fun, otherwise what's the point?   Sorry for the wall.  Tl;Dr make friends before its to late"

There are no clubs which don't revolve around rugby,cricket or football. I used to do ju-jitsu in the next town over but there was only one person in the 15-22 age range and I hated training with  all the little kids.  I also managed to have a violent nervous breakdown at school last year and get expelled due to Academic Pressure and Failing to choose the right subjects losing any friends I had in the 6 years I was there  I go to an inner city school with a 50 mile catchment area to do coursework based media studies  where the people are nice but very professional and often see me as a Childish Hindrance rather than an professional asset and the only one I'm friendliest with live 70 minutes away."

It's just been so deep-rooted in them that it's hard to feel differently. Maybe having them watch some pro-LGBT videos, or do they have any LGBT centers or a GSA they could go to in the area? I don't think you're overstepping. I think it would benefit your friend to talk to people going through the same thing.  This is such a messed up situation and I'm still looking for solutions myself, I will let you know if I think of anything else."

LGBTeens,3d6u09,Keniree,5,Tue Jul 14 00:26:05 2015 UTC,"So, you're attracted to a guy who is acting in a ""more than friends"" manner towards you on numerous occasions, yet insists he is straight every time you confront him on his actions.  Yes, you are crushing on him and he is aware of this. He has done some inappropriate-type thingies with you after that. However, he could see the contact at the campfire and pool as a simply friendky gesture.  It's possible he isn't fully straight, unwilling to acknowledge that and is fooling around with you as a way to explore that part of his sexuality. He may be unwilling to come out as anything other than straight due to fear of negative reactions. Because you're crushing on him, he sees you as a safe outlet.   There also is the chance that he is messing with your head, but I find that unlikely.  As for what you can do, you can sit him down and talk to him about how he's affecting you. You can request that he either stops acting like that or some kind of explanation."
LGBTeens,3d6u09,Keniree,2,Tue Jul 14 00:22:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply, means a lot.

LGBTeens,3d5yfv,Nexus1999,4,Mon Jul 13 19:59:21 2015 UTC,"Well, if I were you I'd first try to figure out their opinion on LGBT people, if it seems that they wouldn't mind at all having an LGBT kid or if they would feel weird at first but would still love you no matter what, then you should consider coming out, this doesn't mean you should though. The most important thing is that you yourself are ready to come out.   So, after you figured out what their opinion is, you can come out in many different ways. Since your parents are mildly conservative, I wouldn't suggest jumping out of a cake or something similar. The best way is probably just starting a conversation with them and telling them how you feel. If that's too scary you can always send your parents a text or do it any other way where you won't have to do it eye-to-eye.  In the end it's the most important that you are ready yourself to come out, if not, then your parents can wait. If you are, then just go for it and do it in a way you feel the most comfortable of using."
LGBTeens,3d5yfv,awkward_lgbt,3,Mon Jul 13 20:18:13 2015 UTC,"Hey! I think I can help you out. I was in the exact same situation a couple of months ago. I am gay, and I live in the Deep South, an extremely conservative and religious part of the U.S. Many people do not like LGBT people where I live. My parents are also very religious and conservative too. Like Zweaplight said before, you need to know if they accept LGBT people. If they don't, then try asking questions, such as ""What do you think about Gay Marriage?"" or ""How would you react if one of your friends came out as gay or bi or trans etc."" if they say that they would support them, and you are confident enough, then get it over with. Trust me, 15 long years of being closeted are so much worse then being out and open with everyone. If they say that ""it's unnatural"" or ""Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve"", I would wait until you were out of the house until you could come out. You wouldn't be under their roof anymore, so you wouldn't have to deal with them every day. Hope this helped you, and good luck!"
LGBTeens,3d5yfv,emeraldfoxx,2,Mon Jul 13 20:35:33 2015 UTC,"Test the waters first. Ask them about some LGBTQ issue (but not talking about yourself yet). If they respond pretty positively, go ahead if you think you're ready. I would suggest leaving a note for them and walking away because that way they have time to think about their response before approaching you and don't blurt out the first thing that comes to their mind (which may be rude/homophobic). Give them time; it's pretty shocking to parents and they sometimes need a little while to come around to it. Good luck! I hope it goes well!"

I'm pretty sure that the girls you encounter wanted to get flirty and get to know you on a ""not so much friend"" basis.  They just lose interest due to the fact you're straight, it's the reason they are at lesbian bars. Not to say that it is a justification for being rude, I have just as many problems with the LGBT community as anybody else would, I just think that you are taking it a little bit more personal than intended. It's a mixture of saltiness that they can't get with you and the fact that you're straight in a somewhat lesbian bar.   At the same time though, there is more than a little bit of a problem with some members of the LGBT community treating the LGBT community as some kind of club, alienating people in a rather ironic manner.  I would just not bother yourself with it, some people are dicks and then there are some people that just want to get flirty. Regardless of gender."

LGBTeens,3d4l8z,FrozenMarshmallow,8,Mon Jul 13 14:00:45 2015 UTC,"So you're saying the LGBT rights movement is suddenly bad for pushing LGBT rights, rather than diverting the focus to every minority group?  I wish these ""articles"" would stop throwing around the word privilege, and patronizing every minority as being ""lesser to society than another"". Because that simply is not true in many respects.  I would really just like to be seen as the same as everybody else, not be treated differently for my sexuality, regardless if it works in my favour."
LGBTeens,3d4l8z,Sherk-,2,Mon Jul 13 19:00:42 2015 UTC,"No one is saying that the LGBT rights movement isn't a positive force for improving the lives of queer people, but at the same time we're doing a disservice to ourselves and others like us if we're not honestly confronting the gaps in this movement.  If you hate the word privilege you'll probably cringe when I use word power-structure, but we need to recognize that the LGBT rights movement, like any social organization, is a power-structure which includes and elevates some, while excluding and keeping others down.  There's a reason we see some faces and not others, that we hear some voices, but not others, and that some people have their stories told while others have them erased.    Think of it this way, the LGBT rights movement is as much a part of society as anything else, so why wouldn't it share the same shortcomings?  There's racism in the LGBT rights movement because society is racist, there's misogyny because society is misogynistic, and so on.  However, if we're really a community that knows what it's like to be different and be oppressed for that difference, and a community that believed in having solidarity with oppressed people everywhere, then we know we have to do better.  That's why, (sorry Mackelmore), it isn't the same love.  It isn't the same because when we hold our lover's hand or kiss them in the street, is isn't only an act of affection, is a political statement.  It's an act of support, not only for every queer person out there, but I like to believe for anyone who finds themselves alienated and oppressed.  It's a statement of defiance against anyone who would try to see difference as deviant.  To dust off that aged old chestnut, the personal is always political.  P.S. Sorry if this read like a screed or a wall of text."

LGBTeens,3d4l8z,JRPGpro,0,Mon Jul 13 23:05:32 2015 UTC,"I completely understand where you're coming from. To clarify a little, what I believe the article was attempting to convey is that it's very important for people within the Queer Community to realize that we are all one community and thus should make every effort to support each other rather than saying or doing things that would be damaging to some, if not many, of its members. I don't think people are being asked to be treated specially because of their specific identity, but rather to recognize our differences so we can work towards making equal rights truly equal. That is to say, we can't be comfortable being just like those who experience greater benefits due to their demographic's general position in society until everyone in the queer community is. Otherwise we're stopping when the jobs half done and leaving the job half done which simply isn't right.    I would quite appreciate to hear what you think about that."

LGBTeens,3d0duf,dragonpurple,3,Sun Jul 12 15:12:40 2015 UTC,Easiest was random people in my uni classes and my brother. Second  easiest was friends from uni. Still haven't told my parents. I think that will be hard.  To everyone: what are your reasons for saying that a particular person or group is harder than another?
LGBTeens,3d0duf,monkey_gamer,2,Sun Jul 12 13:49:06 2015 UTC,"I came out during a particularly untimely intervention concerning my mental health and condition. This was to my immediate family. Given the depression and near hysteria at their methods of discussion, that was the hardest coming out, one I wish I had more control over.  In contrast to that, fast forward a year or so, came out to a friend online because I made some joke about being attracted to someone else we knew. That was easier because I was less insecure and comfortable, not because of the previous experience but because I had learned to cope with the mental aspect and had grown emotionally. I now had more range than that of a teaspoon. That was the easiest, casual, awkward but still funny.  It was more control orientated. I was forced to come out to cover for a range of relevant issues that I couldn't express to my family. My friend is a cool guy and I never really felt the need to come out until he asked. It was a safer environment, I didn't have to worry about physical violence and he couldn't affect me psychologically because he had nothing on me.  TL;DR: Safe, comfortable, control was easier than the Spanish Inquisition"

The hardest was ""coming out"" to myself, it's not so much coming out but more like accepting that I am indeed gay, and that was quite hard in my opinion. Coming out to my mother wasn't easy either, but I knew she would take it well, so it wasn't really hard either. The only person I haven't come out to yet is my father and that's only because I have absolutely no idea how he would react to it."

Definitely the easiest people to tell were the people I met at a Twenty Øne Piløts show a bit over a week ago because most of them are queer too.

Solution 1: A sets C up with B, which clears the way for A to turn D gay.  That seems like what you're trying to do. It will not work. I'm sorry to say it but it's best to get over straight crushes before it's too late and you're completely consumed by it.  Solution 2: A gets D alone and asks him how he feels in a non-threatening way. There may have been another reason why A was rejected. But don't get your hopes up.  Hope it works out. Your situation sucks I hope you figure it out."

LGBTeens,3cz9te,DeusBex,4,Sun Jul 12 20:28:34 2015 UTC,"OP, your first mistake in this was saying it's an alternative to grindr. The makers of the app describe it as more of a kind of a facebook for the LGBTQ community as opposed to a hook up app. The idea of this is that it's not for hookups, but for meeting new people who probably live incredibly far away."

LGBTeens,3cyj9q,emeraldfoxx,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:51:01 2015 UTC,I can totally relate. I've literally just reddited all summer. One thing I feel like really helps with social anxiety (for me) is volunteering because then when you're in the situation you have a defined role instead of just being there and you get practice interacting with people but you don't have to be super interacty and you can just simply do your volunteer job if you want.

LGBTeens,3cyj9q,electriczero,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:16:51 2015 UTC,Yeah that makes sense. Having something planned to do that I have to accomplish makes me less anxious than just being in public with nothing set out for me to do. I might try this thanks

You don't have to change your mannerisms or interests, your friends and family will accept you   Not always easy for people stuck in situations with unaccepting peers and parents, coming out in those situations are generally a bad idea since (most) teenagers rely on their parents financially. So until they are fully self sufficient it's a dangerous idea to come out.   stop being so depressed and negative all the time.   Ah yes, the easiest thing to do! We have finally found a cure for depression, why has no one thought of this before! /s   Life is too fucking short to not be positive   Hey, a sentiment I finally agree with, if only it was as easy as it sounds.  I know this comes from a good place but it just seems kinda insensitive, I don't know. I guess if it wasn't labeled as ""advice"" I wouldn't care so much, but labeling it as such kinda invalidates a lot of perfectly valid issues people may have."

In general I think it is good advice - I don't think that many people's parents would stop supporting them if they came out to them and coming out does not necessarily have to be to people who will not accept you/you rely on to support you. Also, I know you can't just become happy if you are actually depressed, but most teenagers are needlessly negative."

LGBTeens,3cwtvu,WolfieZee,2,Sat Jul 11 20:52:39 2015 UTC,"I know. But eventually it will just become another problem to deal with. I know it seems difficult but you would be way better off getting off that stuff now while you can.  Are there any other hobbies or things you can do or eat that could replace cigarettes? Coffee is one thing one of my friends used. It isn't great for you to binge on but it is definitely a start, and a step up from cigarettes. Or you can take nicotine tablets to help ween yourself slowly off without the damage that comes with smoking.  In the end the goal would be to curb addiction both the cigarettes and your eating disorder. Cigarettes are only a small temporary fix and will hurt you in the endgame. Trust me, I know about these sort of ""temporary relief"" type things. I have severe OCD, ADD, depression, anxiety, all of which I was only able to get under control by confronting the issue head on. Every time I would use food to escape, I would feel fine but the next day would be worse.  Recently I was able to finally see that you have to look at the big picture and just CONFRONT IT. Sure I was overweight and didn't want to go swimming and stuff..but I kept the dream of feeling and looking better in my mind. I lost 30 pounds. My distractions from food and my symptoms through this time were video games and my big beautiful golden retriever. It is okay to have vices and distractions, but not ones that will hurt your health.  And let me tell you. There is no better feeling than losing 30 pounds and seeing the look on you acquaintances' (and even enemies') faces she  they see you.  So don't let today worry you. Think about the big picture."
LGBTeens,3cwtvu,Hexomin,3,Sat Jul 11 21:26:16 2015 UTC,"Eating disorders are absolutely horrible illnesses. They have the highest mortality rate of any class of mental illness. Recovering is likely one of the hardest things you'll ever do, it certainly was the hardest thing I've ever done, but it is doable.  Recovering on your own is essentially impossible. You need some kind of support. Ideally, this would come from trained professionals. If you are unable to get professional help, reach out to anyone in your life who you think you can trust. Talking about your eating disorder is insanely difficult, but not talking about it could kill you. I remember when I first told my parents that I needed help. I was fucking terrified, even though I knew that they wouldn't reach badly and would be able to get me the help I needed. They weren't completely surprised; they had already noticed the weight loss. Looking back, however, I know that if I hadn't gotten help then, I would have died.  You don't want to end up in the later stages of an eating disorder. I ended up in the hospital for anorexia and, while it was lifesaving, it was also torturous. Eating normally again after a long period of fasting makes you feel like shit. There's no other way to put it. It just sucks. I was in the hospital for a month, which is actually a relatively short stay as anorexia goes.  When you say you're 20 pounds over your ideal weight, do you mean a healthy weight, or the weight your illness is telling you is ideal. Even when I was at my sickest and suffering from severe malnutrition, I was more than 50 pounds over my ideal weight of 100 lbs. I realize now that I never could have even reached my ideal weight, my heart would have stopped long before that point.  This brings me to my next point. You need to see a doctor to have your physical health evaluated. Eating disorders destroy basically every system in your body. Even though I'm almost completely recovered, I still have some lasting physical damage that will take years to heal. My bones will never be quite as strong as they should be, but, with proper management, I can stay physically healthy. You don't have to tell your parents why you want to see a doctor if you don't want to. Make up some excuse or simply mention it when you next see the doctor for something else, but be sure you get evaluated by a doctor as soon as possible.  Smoking and taking supplements to lose weight is the wrong approach. It won't fix the underlying disorder, though it might make it easier to cope short term, and you don't want substance abuse as another separate problem to deal with.  What made everything harder for me was having a stereotypically female disorder. It felt like somehow, just because of my gender, my suffering wasn't legitimate and that I was an even bigger disappointment to my parents. I now see just how fucked up my thoughts truly were. All suffering is legitimate. While eating disorders more often affect women, men aren't immune. Just another reason why gender stereotypes need to disappear.  If you take anything from my barely coherent rambling, I hope it's that you need help in this process. Reach out to anyone. In the moment, it will be horrible, but in the long term, it's what's going to help you get better.  One final thing: eating disorders are deadly illnesses. If at any point you feel that you life is in danger, either because of physical complications or because of a risk of suicide, call an ambulance immediately. Don't worry about the what your parents will say or anything else, just call. Hospitalization should be a last resort, but it can be necessary. When I got my parents to take me to the hospital, I was only a few hours away from death. If I hadn't gone then, I wouldn't be writing this right now.  Best of luck. This disease can be beaten. It isn't easy, and you can't do it on your own, but you can do it."

Also, I don't personally like when people say they're ""genderblind"".

I feel a sense of emotional attraction to some of them, but it's rather rare, and I don't know if it ever transitions to a sense of physical arousal. In dreams is has, interestingly - sometimes I have dreams where I see a pretty girl and I feel deep romantic longing for her, and sometimes she's naked and I have actual sexual desire, but in the waking world I seem pretty much homo. My brother, interestingly, has said that he has the same experience - he is as straight as you can possibly imagine, but when I once told him this he said that in dreams, he seems to be bisexual too.

But I can relate to that feeling of wanting to get away, at least, and the dread that I'll never leave home (although for different, less important reasons).  But you know what? I'm going to find a way eventually, and so are you. Yes, you have to go through two years of NS. But you'll have so many more years ahead of you. Hopefully your parents let you study overseas. But even if they don't, there are other ways to get to Canada. Maybe you'll have to work a few years, or get a scholarship, or even do a Kickstarter or something. But you can make it. You will make it. Sure, there will be obstacles. You might face discrimination. You might have trouble getting into a relationship. But you've just got to take it one step at a time. Things like appearance and social skills, you can work on those. If you feel boring, you can find some hobbies. It's not always easy, but it can be done.  If you're worried about what your parents will think when you come out (and rightly so), then you might want to wait a bit. Yes, it absolutely sucks to not be able to be open with them. But get yourself to a place where you know you can support yourself on your own if worse comes to worst. And who knows? Attitudes change. Maybe, hopefully, they'll be fine with it, even support you. Some parents just take some time to come around.  But for now, just take things one step at a time. You can have the life you want. You can do this. Just hang in there."

You know how people always say that others give up because they look at how far they have to go instead of how far they've come? I've looked back at everything I've been through and to be honest, it doesn't actually make me any less inspired to continue. For me, I do that and I end up thinking ""Well, I've come this far. Even if I ended it now, at least I can say I've tried.""  This never-ending road without any clear indicators of its destination just gets to me a lot. It's not that I'm not strong enough. It's that the longer I go, the less I hope. I look around me and I see my classmates worrying about silly things like finding a girlfriend/boyfriend and planning for an outing with their cliques every day. Then, I look at myself and I just can't help but feel like I'm nothing. Given a choice to be straight, I'd rather not go through that at all. I'd very much rather just have the choice of disappearing.   But nonetheless, I'll keep going on for as long as I can. Thank you very much once again.

Yes, you've tried, and you've gone through plenty, and that's amazing. But there is always more to try, more to become, more to live. Find something to hold onto when things get hard. Religion (if you are so inclined), a friend, your values. Anything. Me, I hold onto my dreams, the crazy ones that may never come true, but there's no chance unless I keep hoping. So I hold on to them with white-knuckled fists, for now at least. I hope you can find something like that.  Please, if you are seriously thinking about ending your life, get help. Find someone to confide in, be it a family member, close friend, school counselor, trusted adult, anonymous person on a hotline. Whoever you can trust. Just from the few words you've shared with me, I can tell you're kind and thoughtful, and it may just be me, but I think I'm sensing some stubborn optimism shining through despite everything, subtle but there.

Of course you always have the option of applying to become a Canadian citizen when you turn 18, but that might be a slightly more complicated process to go through."

I don't know, some people might say it's morally wrong to keep dating her, but I don't think it's wrong. If you don't tell her, though, it will put strain on the relationship because you are hiding a part of yourself. I don't know. Just my two cents."

Looking back, I wish I could've slapped myself in the face. No matter how shitty life seems with your parents, it really is temporary. There's a whole world out there that you'll get to explore.

She, along with many parents, would want their kids to be straight simply because they don't want them to deal with discrimination, not because they think it's wrong.  However, gay marriage is legal now, and gay acceptance is becoming more and more mainstream. Plus, she is ignorant for calling it a choice.   Just give her time to calm the heck down. If she really still loves you, then she will calm down and things will be better off since she knows.

I know what it's like to lose hope and feel like your life is a black hole.  Your mother is wrong. You are fine just the way you are.  Since you feel suicidal, my first advice is TALK TO SOMEONE! Childline has an online service (or find your country's equivalent.)   Once you've done that, plan to go to the shops today or tomorrow. Buy your favourite food and drink. Put on your favourite music and sing really loud. Plan to hang out with your best friend, buy tickets to a movie, have a trip to the seaside. Buy that video game you've been thinking of getting. Fill your life with things that make it worth getting up in the morning.  Might I also suggest going to the doctor? They will take your feelings very seriously and might put you in touch with someone who will help.  If your family is making you miserable, surround yourself with support as much as you can. On reddit, with friends, at school.  And please keep us updated. I want to know you're still here.  Hugs x1000!!"

I've been blasting Nicki Minaj, Beyoncé, Rihanna, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, and Lana Del Rey all day with my best friend to try to keep myself composed. We got Starbucks and watched To Write Love On Her Arms (which, while a good movie, wasn't entirely the best thing to watch while considering suicide and relapsing to self harm).

Sometimes I almost hurt myself, but I never did it because I - weak-willed though I am! - stopped myself, knowing that it wouldn't solve anything. Over time I learned to look on the bright side again, and the experience has made me a better person, I think. If I could do it, you can too. You can get through this. No maybes. No buts. You can, and you will. And that's the end of it. (I hope I don't sound too harsh saying that, but self-pity gets you NOWHERE. I learned not to accept it in myself long ago and hopefully you will be able to develop the same habit.) That voice that says you're worthless, or that your life is ruined, or whatever hurtful things it's saying? If you give into that voice, you're letting the evil in the world - indeed, you're letting your parents - win. Be a stubborn rebellious asshole like me and shoot that hateful sorrowful voice the bird. Righteous indignation can sometimes carry one through difficulties that no other emotion can.

LGBTeens,3cv6s2,_alco_,3,Sat Jul 11 03:15:47 2015 UTC,"People have come up with very specific terms for what you're feeling, dont feel like hunting them down. They're all basically a subset of being bi though, so you might fall there.   Also, giving head is hard and just because one guy sucked at it (no pun intended) doesn't mean the next will. Don't let the quality of a single previous sexual experience get in the way.   Finally, guys can be just as beautiful and cuddly as girls while maintaining a masculine personality, just like yourself. If that's what you're into, that's great. The only problem with that is that it will take a little more time to find someone like that who is gay because they're the last person you'd expect. Those gay mannerisms are what make gay dating possible. That and grindr (not recommended)."

LGBTeens,3cu3m5,throwaway129446,17,Fri Jul 10 20:02:08 2015 UTC,"Adult trans woman here,   So last month I realized I was gay, but I still kind of look at women and think ""Wow, she's hot/cute/attractive"" but not in a ""I want to hit that"" kind of way. I don't really know how I look at girls now, but I'm starting to think maybe it's envy??   I get that. For me when I look at girls sometimes I want to sleep with them but a lot of times I also kinda want to be them. It's hard to tell the difference at times.   But the thing is, I don't have any feelings of dysphoria (I don't think I do, at least. maybe I'm mistaking dysphoria for something else?)   Not every trans person experiences crippling dysphoria and every trans person experiences dysphoria differently. Some simply don't have it.   I occasionally have daydreams (and regular dreams once in a long while) about being a girl.   This is normal, even cis people do this occasionally   I've also heard that trans women don't like having a penis   Not all trans women have a problem with their genitalia. In fact, my best friend is a trans woman who likes her penis quite a bit. Everybody's different and it's okay to be trans and want to keep your penis.   When I was really young I also liked wearing my mom's jewelry and some of her shoes, and then from when I was 14-15 (I'm 17 now) I crossdressed because it turned me on but it also kind of felt right.   I saw a documentary once about Kate Bornstein and she covered this exact topic. She used to go to hotels with women's clothes and masturbate while wearing them. It's not uncommon at all for deep emotions to affect your sexuality. While it COULD be a fetish, it sounds like you were just a horny teen. Especially since it's no longer erotic for you but it still feels right.   but only for maybe 20 minutes and then I want to put my guy clothes back on... and the strange part is that I don't feel like a girl the rest of the time!!    Contrary to popular belief, gender is a very fluid thing. Some people actually identify as genderfluid - that their identity changes from male to female and vice versa on a regular basis.   I've always liked doing guy stuff (other than sports/roughhousing), I didn't have any female behavioral traits as a kid (like a feminine walk, voice, temperament, etc), I don't really understand how women think most of the time, and I've always got along better with guys than girls.   Yeah I was the exact same way when I was younger.   one last thing: I'm really submissive in sex. I (theoretically :p) like being a bottom, and instead of getting a BJ I'd rather give one. I don't really want to be the one doing any penetration in almost any situation. I don't know if this is common for gay men or not   This has no bearing on whether or not you're trans. There are dominant women and submissive men. There are also partners that try to be equal in sex.   I was completely happy with myself and my body until last night when I started thinking about whether I'm trans or not. to be completely honest I THINK I'm male but I can't stop thinking about what it would be like to be female and whether I would be happier that way which is why I made this post.   Questioning your identity is good. It's normal and it's healthy. It's certainly possible you'll come out of this with no further trans feelings and you can have more security in your sense of self because you've explored this. Frankly the realization of me being trans was a very sudden thing though looking back I definitely had trans-related feelings in the past even if they were hard to interpret.  Gender is a REALLY complicated thing and your confusion and worry are perfectly reasonable. It's okay to ask questions and feel unsure of yourself. Hang in there OP.  Edit: I just saw this   I also heard that a lot of trans women can double cross their legs and usually have a 30 degree bend in the arm at the elbow. I can easily double cross my legs and have a 20 degree bend in my elbow.   All I can say is... wat? Uh, I have no idea where you'd hear something like that, none of that has anything to do with your gender at all."

LGBTeens,3cu3m5,KaossTheFox,2,Sat Jul 11 00:03:57 2015 UTC,Nobody but you can answer this. Educate yourself on different gender identities/sexuelities so you can make an educated answer! Good luck :)
LGBTeens,3cu3m5,ostrichsauce,2,Fri Jul 10 21:55:06 2015 UTC,"so, this really comes down to one question, do you feel more comfortable calling yourself a woman or a man? the rest is pretty much irrelevant. the way you act, talk, walk dress, act in bed, the things you like, the genitalia you have, all these things have nothing to do with your gender.  so really, ask yourself, would you rather your friends refer to you with he/him pronouns or she/her pronouns? or neither, and you would rather be reffered to with they/them? its also a possibilty that your gender fluid, meaning sometimes you feel like a man, sometimes a woman, sometimes neither.  i know this may seem really confusing and complicated, but dont look at it that way. once you really start to explore who you are, its fun. you are you. be who you want to be."

Even after coming out to him, we do a lot of stuff that even relationships don't do (I'm his first kiss, we've sexted [I know right it's kinda weird], and we're way more gay than I am). However, he remains straight. It might be best to somehow try and figure out what's happening - is he experimenting, comfortable with you, etc. Once you figure out what's happening, you can proceed. But that's what I'd do first.  Note: This friend of mine has known I'm gay since before all this started - yet he's still totally willing to make out sometimes, while remaining straight."

Keep it light, don't be clingy and after making a move, if he doesn't reciprocate you have to accept it and move on. As for making a move, subtle physical contact is a good way to know if he feels some way about you (whatever his sexuality is). Try lightly brushing his arm or leg and judge his reaction."

Most importantly though, I learned from my brother (who is, ironically, homophobic and is the one important person I'm not out to) that you can't live for someone else. You need to live for yourself first. You need to learn to love yourself before you can love someone else. You need to learn to be happy by yourself, because a relationship where your only happy because your with someone is not a relationship, it's a crutch."

LGBTeens,3crxm0,ValleDaFighta,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:11:20 2015 UTC,"i was in that exact position in high school. i lived in a small, rural town where everybody knew everybody else, and my options were severely limited. once i hit 16 years old, i felt like there was nobody out there for me. the people i was interested in were not interested in me, or i wasn't interested in the people that were interested in me. in the rare times when there was mutual interest, it somehow ended up not working out.  all that to say, it's okay. there is nothing wrong with you because you haven't dated much. where you are currently living is playing a large part in how you're feeling, and i can safely advise you that when you leave, things will be easier. not necessarily better, since simply moving can't fix everything, but if you move to a more urban, open-minded environment, you're much more likely to find potential dating partners who will suit you better.  while you are in missouri, however, use that time wisely. build platonic relationships with people who you have some things in common with and are on some sort of same level as you. get involved with activities inside or outside of school.  also, a romantic relationship in high school is not the be-all, end-all. dating someone doesn't fix all of your problems, nor will it ever – speaking from experience."

When you do get it, first 4 days wash with non iodized seasalt water after every meal and then switch to non alchoholic mouth wash twice a day, drink lots of cold water and drinks. Stay clear of booze for the first week. Take naproxen or cetirizine. After two weeks you should be good. If any piercing gets infected, never take it out.

LGBTeens,3cq3pe,MDMA_zing,5,Thu Jul 9 21:37:56 2015 UTC,"''done without parental knowledge''   I can't say I agree ENTIRELY with this. 15 years old and getting a sex change seems like it's moving in the right direction, but, try as we might, we teens are STILL unsure of ourselves. I highly doubt teens would view transgender as ''a fad'' or a cool ''phase'', but be honest. How many times have you seen ''I THINK I'M TRANS BECAUSE I LIKE BOY CLOTHES'' or ''am I trans?'' by teens? They aren't sure and jumping to conclusions, without thinking and discovering yourself first, can be catastrophic with something as free as this.   I agree that parental CONSENT should not be necessary if someone wants to transition - if you're sure, fuck parental consent. YOUR BODY, not theirs.   Overall, this is both good and bad, and proper teaching and triple checking 5 times should be mandatory. Like any other operation that isn't a straight up, life or death emergency, this needs proper monitoring and more than just a teen's one ''go ahead''."
LGBTeens,3cq3pe,keichunyan,2,Fri Jul 10 00:49:41 2015 UTC,"Exactly my thoughts on this article.  Teens that feel they might be trans/need a sex change should be seeing medical professionals first before undergoing such a life-changing operation, and should be giving more time for their thoughts to mature.  Definitely more research on this subject couldn't hurt, either."
LGBTeens,3cq3pe,Genesistm123,8,Fri Jul 10 04:14:35 2015 UTC,I seriously think this is a bad idea. At 15 you are really young and to be honest I don't think you should have the right to have a sex change. People do stupid things as a teenager because they are growing up and the brain is in conflict. There are reasons we wait until you are 18.
LGBTeens,3cq3pe,conservativehomo,5,Thu Jul 9 23:02:37 2015 UTC,"(FYI I'm 15 trans MtF and want my vagina right now)  I agree with you to a degree. Any 15 year old should not be able to say ""I want a P/V right now"" and go in and get one. However, with a therapist's letter saying its a good idea, the 15 year old saying its a good idea, and having known their gender identity and lived that way for 2+ years, they should be able to get their P/V."

If a teen has been going through therapy, there has been proper research and monitoring, parental consent should NOT be necessary. All you need is a ''MY BABY WAS BORN A GIRL AND WILL STAY A GIRL'' kind of parent. Parental consent should not be mandatory for these things, I personally believe it's bullshit that parental consent is needed for operation.

LGBTeens,3cq3pe,iObJay,2,Fri Jul 10 12:48:59 2015 UTC,I mean if you have no parental consent and no therapist has said it's a good idea then you shouldn't be able too. If a therapist thinks it's for the best then of course it doesn't matter what your parents think.

Tho I thought I'd chime in here and save you /u/ShawnReardon!   I too was a bit hairy as a teen and in my very early 20's decided to shave. BAD IDEA!    Dealing with ingrown hairs on your chest, legs, etc it a total PITA! I""m sure there is some science to this but when I shaved, the hair just grew back thicker, longer, and faster. Once you shave it, you will ALWAYS shave it. It's a chore at this point in life.   So my advice, is just get comfy with your own, and if you like guys with less hair, then so be it. You'd be surprised at guys that just LOVE a hairy dude. ^(Bears / Cubs Club)  Good luck and remember, DON'T DO IT! IMO, of course."

LGBTeens,3crcn7,Hexomin,2,Fri Jul 10 13:06:40 2015 UTC,"Body hair is one of the sexiest parts of a guy IMO. Somewhere in the middle between a bear and twink, what I believe is now considered an 'otter'. Otter to cub status is about where I like it. Facial hair really looks sexy, but there is a fine line between sexy and overgrown/laziness status. It's needs to be kept trimmed, but not shaved all the way down.  I once shaved my chest, stomach and pubes. It just didn't feel right for me and it took FOREVER. The most I do now is trim the pubes but that's it."

LGBTeens,3cocjc,that1kid295,3,Fri Jul 10 01:43:01 2015 UTC,"In short, he was a popular youtuber years ago, and he still has ~6 million subscribers now.  He's still fairly popular, but I think it's mainly with the preteen crowd because he has the humor of a middle schooler (or he could be faking it because he knows his audience for all I know) in my opinion.  I'm not too familiar with the racism part as I never watched too many of his videos.  I do know that he did blackface (he did apologize once people educated him on it) and relied on stereotypes a lot with it.  There's probably more to it that I don't know about, but that's the main thing I've heard.  As for the bisexuality, he's been seeing a therapist for quite a while about coping with it as (I think) he said it was causing a lot of stress, anxiety, and depression while he tried to figure it out.  He seemed quite relieved about telling people, and even touched on him projecting his insecurities about his sexuality into hate towards bisexuals prior to accepting himself."

LGBTeens,3cjhg0,toona666,37,Wed Jul 8 11:48:14 2015 UTC,"I don't speak for all Bisexuals, but personally I'm not going to hold it against you. everyone has to come out in their own way and if coming out as Bi first helped you then who am I to say doing that is wrong? sure in the grand scheme of things it may not be the most healthy for the community but the most important thing is that you were safe and happy coming out. Don't feel guilty for doing it that way occasionally you gotta do what you gotta do. I'm sure most people will understand that and they probably won't hold it against you either. You're at least aware of Bi-erasure and seem to be making a conscious effort to help in that regard which is way more that most people. Congratulations for coming out btw the world is a scary place :)"
LGBTeens,3cjhg0,DaleEvns,12,Wed Jul 8 15:38:21 2015 UTC,"Well for some, bisexuality is a stepping stone toward coming out as gay. But that doesn't mean it isn't for everyone. Some people's final destination is bisexuality. It's fine if you use it as a stepping stone, but don't assume that it is for everyone.  Note: this isn't really directed at OP, I'm just saying that we as a whole shouldn't assume that bisexual people haven't picked a side."

LGBTeens,3cjhg0,reidiants,9,Wed Jul 8 15:41:07 2015 UTC,"From what I've gathered, I think he just meant that when he came out, he came out as bisexual as a way of easing into it."

LGBTeens,3cjbd5,Thatdoctorperson,4,Wed Jul 8 12:55:49 2015 UTC,"I am a bisexual, and because of this i am going to have to spend the rest of my life falling in love with people who will never love me back because of what is hetween my legs   This is the case for everyone, no matter their sexuality, you're not unique in that.   I will be ostracized by the straight community because I like men and simultaniously ostracized by the gay community because I like women   But that shouldn't matter because you're a part of the bisexual community?   I feel like love is so hopeless, it is the only thing I want, to feel that there is someone who feels the same about me as I do about them, for my happiest part of the day to be derived from making them laugh. And yet I am terrified that isnt going to happen.   Once again, this is the case for everyone and has nothing to do with your sexuality.   On top of this , I have found the one... The one person who I want to spend the rest of my life with he is perfect in everyway, but he is taken. He has alluded to himself being bi sexual but it is irrelevant as he is already in a relationship with a girl he truley loves. And don't get me wrong I am happy for him, but its hard not to be jealous when everything you want is in front of you and you know you will never have it.   And again, has nothing to do with your sexuality.  If you're sad or hopeless that's too bad, but don't blame this on your sexuality or unaccepting communities. Not one of the problems you descrive originate from either of those."

But I never appreciated how much he used misleading titles, joked about it over and over again, videos like ""I'M GAY?!"" followed by shit like ""ARE YOU GAY TEST"" ""GAY CHALLENGE"" ""GAY TUMBLR TAG"" or other stuff like that. Like I'm not saying it deeply offends me, I just think it's a bit asshole-ish and annoying.   If people really like Shane that's fine, to each their own.

I've been watching him since early 2009 or so, and he put so much emphasis on being straight and religious, I never expected this to happen. I remember his first guy kiss with Onision and how he was so freaked out by it.  Like Joey Graceffa, he was someone so obviously non-hetero that I expected him to be straight."

I probably get like 10 hours of sleep each night when i can sleep in as late as i want. I normally end up eating breakfast at like 12:30 and then not having lunch at all.

I generally need to wear something shirt-like and shorts-like, so that I look presentable if I need to get up, but it can't be too warm.

LGBTeens,3chvzf,DeusBex,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:28:19 2015 UTC,"In the winter I usually sleep in an old shirt and gym shorts, but during the summer just gym shorts (I don't want my family to walk in with it all hanging out since I tend to kick the covers off during the night). I do sleep with a fan on all night, and it's usually on most of the day. Our AC unit (Central AC) doesn't usually kick on unless we are having a really hot night. Here in the LA suburbs, it's a desert with lawns so it's hot AF during the day but at night it usually gets down to the 70s which is fine with me.  My target is 8 hours of sleep (aka the recommended amount) which I usually do make unless I can't sleep for one reason or another and/or I need to wake up early the next morning. It's funny, during the summer my sleep schedule flips a lot. Some days I'll get up at 7AM like I would for school, others I don't get up until noon. I'm very strange lol."

Don't Ask, Don't Tell was instated in '93, 22 years later, the  SCOTUS rules that banning gay marriage is unconstitutional. And that's just in the US. Media representation is very important, and we do see LGBT characters well enough both popular and niche media. As we gain more and more freedom and reasons to not hide who we are, culture will change too. It just takes time."
LGBTeens,3ceslp,Valladium,3,Tue Jul 7 11:38:20 2015 UTC,"That's how any history of any movement is. Some groups and people of it are raised as heroes, others are forgotten.

LGBTeens,3ceslp,ValleDaFighta,3,Tue Jul 7 13:29:39 2015 UTC,"It is very very unfortunate and sad, but as others have said we are making leeps and bounds towards equality, it might not be the best at the moment but some progress is better than no progress. What really rubs the wrong way is how many people outside of the LGBT circle believe that the fight for equality is now over because of SCOTUS but that couldn't be farther from the truth.   There are still many problems within the LGBT community as well as outside of it, but we must continue taking steps to eliminate or at least mitigate these issues (teen drinking, addiction, suicide, homelessness, etc) inside of the community for the next generation. It sucks and it sometimes feels like we're just walking in circles, but we have to press on in order to get anywhere."

When it comes to a history of the movement I'm unsure what you mean. Sure there has always been a struggle with getting acceptance from our peers but I strongly disagree with comparing it to something like,  say the civil rights movement. Representation in the media is a whole other ball game. When people just ""write in"" an LGBT character they just become a token. Characters are meant to mean something and contribute to the plot. I'm actually seeing more and more LGBT in media than ever, but sometimes the characters are just gay just to be gay and it's annoying.   When someone writes a story, it's theirs and they deserve to tell it the way they want it to be told. Being LGBT is becoming a fashion statement quicker than ever."
LGBTeens,3cdxz4,microwave_juice,6,Tue Jul 7 04:03:09 2015 UTC,"I mean, based on your information, unless he's a douche, if he knows youre gay and makes comments like the kissing thing, he must have some feelings towards you. Since you came out to him, has he ever hung out with you? Maybe he's just been busy lately. How long has the ignoring been going on? If he made the kissing comment after you came out to him, there's no way he is entirely straight.

LGBTeens,3cdxz4,TK0B5,5,Tue Jul 7 04:36:29 2015 UTC,"Well, im sure bi is an option, but snapchatting like that means nothing.

Or that girl you were texting?"" Im sure im not alone when i say that i tried to both convince myself that i wasnt gay or at the least just bi. Even after i was convinced that i was gay i still went through the motions. I guess i still wanted to act like a normal high school student. :/  Lol that turned more into a rant about my problems xD  But anyway, i dont think you can really get a definite answer but speculating, but by the sound of it, id say he isnt entirely straight."
LGBTeens,3cdxz4,TK0B5,3,Tue Jul 7 04:44:13 2015 UTC,"Hopefully not... He also made a rap with the line ""I put my dick in some dude's rectum, I put my dick in some dude and I rekt him,"" and I made the comment ""Dude you're totally gay"" and he just looked at me, and went back to trying to rap."
LGBTeens,3cdxz4,TK0B5,4,Tue Jul 7 04:51:09 2015 UTC,"omg that's actually some decent word play. I wouldn't read into that too much though if he's anything like my friends. I mean, if you don't want to necessarily ask him if he's gay, you could approach it more as a friend who's been acting weird lately.   I feel as if adding gay into any confrontation makes it that much more nerve wracking. Maybe be like ""hey, I feel like you've been acting differently lately. You haven't been responding to a lot of my texts and you seem different when we hang out. Is everything okay?"" Obviously word it a little better, but if you come off as just a caring friend, it might not be as awkward to maybe get him to get into the gay conversation."

I'm more worried that they'll just treat me differently because they'll be afraid that I'll try to get in their pants...  Do you think it would be better to tell them one by one though? There's obviously some that I am closer with than others so would it be good to tell my closer friends alone and then tell the others in a group with the ones that already know, so that I have moral support in a way?"

I came out to two of them at the same time while we were walking back from a party together, it went great. They didn't really care. I think I prefer coming out to two people at a time than one person, I find it's less silent and awkward, easier to keep it light and move the conversation along.  None of them have been treating me any different since (other than the one I came out to but you can read that story here). I'd advise you to go for it. If they don't want to hang around with you because you like boys then they weren't real friends anyway #fuckem"
LGBTeens,3cdn9x,Hexomin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:52:41 2015 UTC,I think the two people plan sounds like a really good idea. I think I'd definitely want to do that if I tell one of the friends that I'm not entirely sure on their stance on the topic.

The next hurdle to jump would be telling the family. :/  Im the last son with my last name and my moms been saying my whole life how much she cant wait for grandchildren... So lol this one will be fun. My cousin came out as gay a few month ago and my immediate family has been the most supportive though, so i think after they get over the fact that ill have to adopt or have a surrogate, itll be fine."

Honestly, I just came out. It was kind of awkward and they were really only semi-supportive and we eventually drifted apart.. It sounds like you all are a very close knit group of friends so that's definitely a positive, have they ever talked about LGBT stuff before with you? If not try bringing it up slowly and see how they react.  It might sound harsh but honestly if they don't accept you you really don't need those people in your life. I know that's easier said than done but if they can't even accept a basic fundamental thing that you have no control over they don't deserve to have an awesome person like you as their friend.   Hopefully this made some sort of sense, if not feel free to ask questions :)."
LGBTeens,3cdn9x,DubbyS23,3,Tue Jul 7 03:28:00 2015 UTC,"We haven't really ever talked about it in the sense of ""are you okay with it"", but it has come up a few times. Obviously when gay marriage was legalized, it came up in conversation. They didn't really show too much of an opinion for it either way. All of my friends that are girls were like ""it's about fucking time"" but all the guys kind of just kept quiet. I figure it's either because they don't want people to think they're gay if they start saying how much they support it, or they just really don't care too much. My friends definitely speak their mind when they don't like something, so I know they don't hate gays. :b  Growing up in a private school, we were allowed to discuss our views on political stuff in class. Last year we had a whole class just dedicated to defending our faith. One week was solely dedicated to homosexuality and the bible and the whole time leading up to it my friends (and most of the student body really) were like ""ugghhh lets see what this begot has to say about this...""  (surprisingly it was actually pretty good of a lesson if I do say so myself xD ) Last night actually -- another time we hung out that I pussied out of coming out -- there was some joke or something when (this probably isn't the exact wording) I said bye and one of my friends said something jokingly like ""youre biiiiii!!!!"" and I was like ""nah dude I'm just gay"", being silly I guess. None of them were like ewww gross, they kind of all just laughed like it was a dumb joke. I don't know if that last situation can be read into at all, but whatever. xD  I don't feel like we'd drift apart, and if we would, it would most likely be because of them going away to colleges out of state. Thanks for the response though. I'm sorry about what happened to your friends :(  I know I can get new friends, and going to art school next year, I'll definitely be in an lgbt friendly environment, but I still want to stay friends with them. :/  EDIT: Holy shit I forgot one of the most important times homosexuality was involved in our friendship. My best friend (that I do kind of have a crush on but lol that's never getting confessed xD ) had a graduation party back in may and later in the night when more of the other friends were coming over to play some video games, he invited a friend of his that was gay and he brought his boyfriend over. Before he came, my friend kind of said like a little ""hey, he's gay, so please don't say any words like fag or anything offensive on accident"". After the gay friend and his boyfriend left, no one gossiped about him or anything. He was just a normal person who came, played some smashbros and then left.  (Sorry this is such a huge wall of text)"

They're still not weirded out.   Anyway, it sounds like you've got an accepting group of friends. Go ahead and tell them however you want. I've come out to groups of friends and also told people one by one, and it's good either way. Any way you tell them, you'll feel much better after you do!   Good luck! :)"

LGBTeens,3cdn9x,A1103,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:06:16 2015 UTC,"The buildup and anticipation of coming out is the worst part for sure.   My advice is to come out to whoever you're talking to as soon as the thought comes into your head. The sooner you say the words, the less time you have to get nervous.   If you need a way to change the subject quickly, just say something like ""Guys, I want to tell you something."" There probably won't be a perfect moment to say it, but if you see an opening, go for it as soon as you can.  Hope everything goes well!"

It seems like you're trying to make him do something that he is not comfortable with. He wants it to be left alone and you should accept that.

You ARE taking advantage of him if you take your chances when he is intoxicated and can't consent properly. You should be disgusted with yourself treating your friend like this and coming here for support. Rapists often choose their victims for a number of reasons, and getting pissed off when they ignore their advances is one of them. Reflect on that.

Turn that positive and add that you 'are interested in physical activities which help to keep your stress levels low; ensuring maximum output in professional tasks'. You're also going to want some references for if they ask, if you can find a tutor at school and ask them nicely.    So you've written a CV? Great. Now send it to places. I don't know whereabouts in the world you are but in the UK we have sites like indeed where you put your location and what jobs you're interested in and it will show you lots. If that's not available, go in to random shops with a physical copy of your CV and ask for it to be given to a manager. MAKE SURE YOU PUT A CORRECT PHONE NUMBER, I MADE THIS MISTAKE TOO MANY TIMES. If the companies like you then they will probably ring you and ask you to come in for an interview-if you hear nothing then RING WEEKLY and say you're interested. Eventually you'll get one. Just make sure you look professional and arrive early.    Good luck <3"

It's important to apply MANY different places. Don't wait to apply to other places just because you want a job at a specific place, because many places don't even contact you after you apply. I actually applied to 9 different places before I got a job, and the only place that called me back was the place that hired me. If you get a job interview, dress nice, but not too nice (unless it's a super formal office job or something.)

Unless you count wetting the bed in a non sexual manner at 12, amazing how attentive other kids are then :c !"
LGBTeens,3c4qeu,guamlessgoodison,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:07:09 2015 UTC,"I think the better phrasing might be: given this sexuality and this social context, it's natural to feel upset."
LGBTeens,3c4qeu,matchu,2,Sun Jul 5 02:19:47 2015 UTC,Yeah that is a much better way to word it.
LGBTeens,3c4qeu,guamlessgoodison,2,Sun Jul 5 12:06:29 2015 UTC,"This, I think, is a matter of identifying what you can and can't control. I totally understand where you're coming from: being gay in this society is a source of frustration, both because of how we're treated and because of our relatively smaller pool. Being straight would definitely be easier.  But that's just one way that the situation could be better, and becoming straight isn't feasible. That doesn't make the problem unsolvable.  What about the situation, then, can you control? Your sexuality is involved in some problem in your life, but it's not itself what's bothering you; what exactly is? What are the other contributing factors to this problem?  Make a list of these contributing factors, and, for each, make a list of ways you can change that factor (if any). Then, go forth and do those things! :) I've found this explicit approach to be incredibly helpful in solving the problems in my life; PM me if you feel like it'd be helpful to have some guidance in that process. It'll make my day to give it a shot :)"
LGBTeens,3c4qeu,matchu,2,Sun Jul 5 02:26:40 2015 UTC,"No one wants to be gay. That being said, there's no way to change your sexuality. It's just something that you have to become comfortable with.  Also, you live in a university town. There's bound to be a LGBT scene there. Make a few inquiries, download some apps. Do something to put yourself out there."
LGBTeens,3c4qeu,Nezgul,2,Sun Jul 5 02:29:31 2015 UTC,"This may sound cheesy, but you have already found the person you are going to spend the rest of your life with.   Yes, that person is YOU.   Start to have a better relationship with yourself (being honest, supportive, appreciative, loving, etc.) and it make it better for others to do the same.   The struggle to find someone to share your life with is part of the human condition regardless of your sexual orientation.   Go out and join groups doing or talking about things you enjoy.  Start to develop friendships.  This will help you develop social skills, confidence as well as learn more about yourself and help you grow. At some point you will find folks who are romantically interested and then you will start dating."
LGBTeens,3c4qeu,joosier,5,Tue Jul 7 10:29:34 2015 UTC,Its a little silly you want to change your sexually just because you want it easier finding a partner... Maybe you need to do a little more maturing before you step into the dating scene
LGBTeens,3c4qeu,YoungQueen97,3,Sat Jul 4 20:24:04 2015 UTC,I think it's completely reasonable.  I don't want to be trans but I am.  Nobody wants to be a minority.
LGBTeens,3c4qeu,iObJay,0,Sun Jul 5 00:01:58 2015 UTC,He said he didnt want to be gay because he wants it to be easier to date... Thats silly and immature and a bit bratty. Nothing in this world will be handed to you or will be easy you learn to live with it
LGBTeens,3c4qeu,YoungQueen97,5,Sun Jul 5 00:08:10 2015 UTC,"I think OP knows that he's engaging in emotional immaturity, and that's why he's asking for help—and that kind of self-awareness is incredibly mature.  You're right that the high-level solution is to learn how to play the hand you're dealt, and he knows that; he's looking for help accomplishing it.  Everyone has emotional issues. The healthy approach is to articulate them and seek solutions. We should encourage that behavior, instead of shaming people for it."
LGBTeens,3c4qeu,matchu,2,Sun Jul 5 02:15:28 2015 UTC,"What's the problem with that? He's right after all. Everybody wants to have someone to love and someone that loves them back, so why is it so 'silly' to want that to be a little easier and in this case being straight?"
LGBTeens,3c4qeu,SomeNab,-2,Sun Jul 5 01:03:42 2015 UTC,"It comes off very immature. Pretty much your saying is this "" I cant find someone to date being gay so ill find someone to date while being straight"" You want something but you cant get it now also comes off as being a brat. But if you think thats right then thats just you.... But imo thats childish, grow up"
LGBTeens,3c4qeu,YoungQueen97,3,Sun Jul 5 01:47:30 2015 UTC,I think you're reading more than what OP wrote. He doesn't actually say that he will attempt to become straight; he's just expressing frustration and looking for help managing it.
LGBTeens,3c4qeu,matchu,2,Sun Jul 5 02:16:44 2015 UTC,"So you never thought it would be easier to be straight? How easier it would be to crush on girls instead of straight guys?   Anyways, like another user said you're probably looking into this a bit too much. Not everybody wants to be gay or face the struggle of being gay, so wishing to be straight is fairly normal imo. If you think that's childish... well, that's just you I guess"
LGBTeens,3c4qeu,SomeNab,-3,Sun Jul 5 16:20:50 2015 UTC,So you wanna take the easy why out when so many other people toughed it out? You right it isnt childish its just being a sore loser
LGBTeens,3c4qeu,YoungQueen97,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:07:40 2015 UTC,"Who stuck a dick in your arse? It's a part of accepting who you are, there are lots of people that wish they were straight for different kinds of reasons. Plus, it's not because he thinks this way now that he will still think that way in about a year. So maybe he is right now going through it and 'toughing it out', just in his own way. Brighten up, jeez."
LGBTeens,3c4qeu,SomeNab,0,Sun Jul 5 22:08:20 2015 UTC,It seems like op is a little butt hurt....Im pretty much done with this whole bullshit of a post and i think you should move on as well. After all there no changing whats been said

You didn't ask to be this way...but you are. It's  living as your truth when it feels being you burns.     And the only way out is through. Be connected.  date you for a little while. Work on being your best you for your eventual Mr. Right. Learn to love yourself through finding and practicing your interests...and keep in mind you will find someone.

Many people have walked this path before and each has come out (ha ha. Sorry) of this emotional and mental bumb in their own way. There is no right or wrong way. There's just the way you come out of it that matters. But know that you will survive this and the world is bigger than you can imagine with many opportunities for fabulous things to happen. You'll be fine, and I believe in you."
LGBTeens,3c5msv,Kurtisthe1st,4,Sun Jul 5 01:06:28 2015 UTC,"Start with hey, they respond and you ask a question. Depending on their answer you can always say ""oh really cool, I like this or that"". Ask them about what they like. People love talking about themselves. Of course, that post also said not to ask too many questions. The thing about online convos is that you can literally walk away from them and come back if you want. If you feel it's dying down just fell them you want to talk later. I'd they're weird, block them and leave it at that."

LGBTeens,3c5l0z,Definetelynottom,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:01:03 2015 UTC,Maybe the Gay Gods can assist you. All gay things come to those who wait. You may want to check out the Facebook page of the closest major to you on the gaybros group. I'll link the page for you. But also there are probably some lgbt clubs or associations nearby you may wish to search out. If that is not your favorite breakfast to eat then I would suggest maybe Tinder. It's not wonderful but for many it can work. And there's also just being a really social butterfly. http://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/2h7xd3/official_gaybros_facebook_group_compendium/
LGBTeens,3c5l0z,GayGodMatt,2,Sun Jul 5 08:05:51 2015 UTC,I was under the impression tinder only did entirely straight matching? Plus I'm pretty sure it uses my Facebook account. I'm out to my close friends and family but publicly is not something I'm entirely comfortable with. Not to mention the hookup culture around it.
LGBTeens,3c5l0z,GayGodMatt,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:25:23 2015 UTC,"While it might not be an option Tinder does in fact have same sex relationship options. But I understand your avoidance of it. Sadly, its very hard to be young and find like-minded people. Unless you find them in highschool or college the next best option is just going places and making friends. No easy task. Most lgbt members go to gay bars buy that isn't always an option, some just don't like the bar scene, or you're just too young. This has been a problem for many generations of young lgbt's. Your options are limited and its going to be very hard to keep yourself half way out and half closeted. You may wish to have an outreach here on reddit. If you live near or in any major city, you could find that city's subreddit and post there. This subreddit and /r/askgaybros is always a good place to start. However, when it comes to real life, there's not much that can be done besides putting yourself out there. I hope I was in some way helpful and I truly  believe you'll do absolutely great. Gays do usually flock together so you'll find them."
LGBTeens,3c52bw,BlackEyedPlease,6,Sat Jul 4 21:28:09 2015 UTC,Just come out! Ya she my not like it but its your life. And remember she can handle her own just be there as friend to her if she needs someone
LGBTeens,3c52bw,YoungQueen97,3,Sat Jul 4 22:15:07 2015 UTC,"Bro listen I'm drunk and this happened to me, she kissed me under a parking lot and we dated for three days before she realised that I didn't care for her. It was the hardest thing she had to deal with in her life as she thought I was faking the whole thing just to use her (I wasn't she kissed me not the other way round). Either way you need to talk to her first, you need to tell her that you are telling everyone anyway but that you don't want it to seem like distancing yourself from her. Remind her that you are a good friend which is why you are telling her first rather than with everyone and tell her that you guys can go looking for boyfriends together. Girls love gbf's and it will take the edge off the conversation. If she says that you are just pretending to get away from her then it may be best to play it by ear, just remind her that you are gay, have been gay for a long ass time and you just were unsure about things, now you know which is why you want to let people know.  Good luck man and message me when you want if you want. In about six hours the cider will be sweated out and I'll be working on getting some French champers, doux obviosly"
LGBTeens,3c52bw,Confused_Nobody,2,Sat Jul 4 23:25:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for your response and the advice! It's really useful. I just typed out this super long response to you but after I read it over again I kinda resolved everything in my head already. Just putting it into words was enough I guess. It's so great to have someone to talk to because of the internet :) I have another question for you though, how did you feel like others took it when you came out to them? Weren't they confused because you dated her just before? Because that's also a thing I'm kinda worried about..."
LGBTeens,3c52bw,Confused_Nobody,2,Sat Jul 4 23:58:21 2015 UTC,"Well I kinda didn't officially come out but people saw how I acted and how I dumped what they saw as a hot girl, they just kinda realised I was gay. Its not yet 100% official at this school but basically everyone knows and they are just cool with it as I'm in Spain which is very liberal."
LGBTeens,3c52bw,Alt2PointOh,3,Sun Jul 5 08:37:36 2015 UTC,"It'll be better to tell her personally than just letting her find out some other way, or get the perception you may be leading her on. I suggest you either tell her that you don't like her (if you're not just ready to come out)  or just... Come out lol"

LGBTeens,3c33j7,Gu3stbot,7,Sat Jul 4 10:26:14 2015 UTC,"I think the reason we get flooded with posts like these is because we ARE teenagers, we aren't exactly adults with a lot of encompassing knowledge that comes with it.  While I sometimes think that some of those posts are a bit, well, ya know, annoying, I and others are guilty of not knowing basic things that seem basic once we understand them.  Relationships are tough, and it's REALLY hard sometimes to view how they are going from an inside opinion, it's not uncommon for people IRL to ask for relationship advice, especially when there are people who aren't quite sure of what exactly they are doin.  And it also comes down to people bein very selfish for a variety of reasons, without it even bein noticeable.  We get bombarded with posts, but they won't notice, either because they feel theirs is more important, didn't read the other posts or even more reasons. It isn't bad to be selfish, but it's hard, especially as someone who may not be the most secure indivual, to see things as the ""Big picture"" or to look at other problems and see their solutions and apply it to their situation.  I'm not sayin that these posts can't get annoyin, because they can, but it is good to remember that, while were teens, were growing up, and some people may not have people who they can talk to about things.  Being gay is still just as hard as it has been, but it is easier to get advice anonymously through the web then to come out to your parents.  Everyone, just remember that you don't always have to post, but don't be afraid too, if you have no one else to turn to especially.  It may be tempting to post, but I always think that you should read other posts on a similar topic to get a basis, then create more precise questions: go from ""How do I get a date"" to ""How do a get a date that likes doing [insert weird hobby or whatever here]"" The more precise the question, the better and more precise the answer is gonna be.  Stay safe everyone!"

Naturally Iron Maiden, Metallica, Megadeth, Iced Earth, etc have been playing in the background. Mostly older metal bands that I've loved since I was like 6.   But if anyone has the patience, Should listen to Ghost, they're like a Satanic Beach Boys. They're not hardcore or anything, it's actually more of a Blue Oyster Cult feel, but with 100% more Satan.

LGBTeens,3c13bz,ravenDivinity,13,Sat Jul 4 06:47:51 2015 UTC,"I get more shit for being more masculine in appearance than feminine. ""But you can't be gay, you act too straight!""

I'm supposed to ""enjoy shopping"" or ""be flamboyant"" or some stupid stereotyping bullshit, and then I get told I'm unattractive. Your last comment about not attacking feminine gay men ""just so you can get masculine obsessed straight men to like you"" is just as attacking as the attack you're accusing masculine gay men of.  Edit: Furthermore I'm not justifying any attack on gay men, masculine or feminine, I just think it's stupid that you go this far to call it out and then do it yourself."

I'd never attack a gay man for being masculine, most gay people I know are. But what pisses me off is when they make fun of femininity, to try to distance themselves from the effeminate gay men. Where all supposed to be in this together. That's what this post is about."
LGBTeens,3c13bz,Pokebow,5,Sat Jul 4 01:38:27 2015 UTC,"And I know way more feminine gay men than masculine gay men.  But I would peel off the last statement since it makes you sound like the exact class of people you seek to call out. It's bad all over. All of these personalities are shamed by each other in the LGBT community, like /u/Gabsreddithole said. Feminine gay men do the same thing to masculine gay men and vice versa. It's disgusting."
LGBTeens,3c13bz,YoungQueen97,23,Sat Jul 4 02:35:50 2015 UTC,"On a similar note, there was a thread here a couple days ago where some of y'all were shaming certain fetish groups at Pride. Y'all need to remember that you're entering this community before a whole wave of people and acting self-righteous about particular groups that have paved the way for LGBT rights is disgusting and ignorant.   You don't want people judging you for your sexuality, so you need to stop judging others. Especially at Pride of all places, Jesus fucking Christ."
LGBTeens,3c13bz,Pokebow,12,Fri Jul 3 23:16:55 2015 UTC,Ikr? The whole point to this movement is to celebrate all kinds of sexualities. To only appreciate certain kinks/interests isn't much better than not appreciating All sexualities.
LGBTeens,3c13bz,YoungQueen97,18,Fri Jul 3 23:19:43 2015 UTC,That wasnt shaming... Half of us were saying it wasn't the right place. Kids are at those parades its not the place to show a dude on his knees wearing a rubber doggy mask
LGBTeens,3c13bz,Pokebow,-2,Sat Jul 4 01:02:54 2015 UTC,"Then don't take your children to Pride? I mean, if parents are so worried about what their children might see at the event, then maybe they should go somewhere else instead of trying to police everyone else."
LGBTeens,3c13bz,IamAnthonological,15,Sat Jul 4 03:13:13 2015 UTC,What the hell?  Pride parades are meant to be for Familes and allies to come together as one. If you wanna march down the street in your fetish gear and have your sex slave/pup nude on a leash and handcuff go to the flotsam bdsm street fair. Pride should be kept a family friendly event like it was back when it was started.
LGBTeens,3c13bz,transandpans,-8,Sat Jul 4 04:51:48 2015 UTC,"Or... Or maybe... You can let parents take the responsibility of their own children and not play parent to grown adults. That works too. Especially since the event is meant to celebrate LGBT culture and those BDSM groups have always been a part of the community. The whole ""Oh noes! Please think of the CHILDREN"" line is tired.  Furthermore, why are you, a seventeen year old, worried about children seeing it anyway? If their parents took them to the event in the first place, that ran the risk of their children being exposed to shit they might not like. But that's the parents' responsibility and concern. Not yours."
LGBTeens,3c13bz,Pokebow,6,Sat Jul 4 05:24:57 2015 UTC,"""Furthermore, why are you, a seventeen year old, worried about children seeing it anyway?""   What does his age have to do with his argument? For the most part I agree with you, but ad hominem attacks are just as tired as ""think of the children"" is, if not more so."
LGBTeens,3c13bz,transandpans,5,Sat Jul 4 11:06:31 2015 UTC,"It's everyone's concern if it's a family event, which pride is intended to be. You should be able to take your child to a family event without needing to worry about whether or not you'll see people in fetish gear. It's fine to support it, it's fine to have fetishes, but pride isn't the place to show them off."
LGBTeens,3c13bz,YoungQueen97,-1,Sat Jul 4 06:08:14 2015 UTC,"pride isn't the place to show them off.   Uh. Since when? And who decided that it wasn't? I mean, my own research about pride has only confirmed my belief that fetishes have always played a large part in them. I think y'all are missing my point.   At what point do we dictate what is and is not acceptable the flaunt at pride? I mean, some people find cross-dressing to be publicly indecent. Should we ban that from pride as well for the sake of the children?   And I haven't been able to go to Pride myself yet, but from what I've seen on the map of the grounds, everything is sectioned off. BDSM shit taking place in a completely different section from the rest of the festivities. If y'all are concerened about it, why not just avoid those sections.  Also, Pride, at least to me, is about visibility. It's about not being ashamed about who you are just because others are uncomfortable by it. I feel like denouncing fetishists is completely contrary to what pride is supposed to stand for.  And to be clear, I am by no means a fetishist or partaker of BDSM. I just think y'all are walking a fine line here."
LGBTeens,3c13bz,Online_Pajama,6,Sat Jul 4 06:17:57 2015 UTC,"Cross dressing isn't inherently sexual. Fetishes are. One is appropriate to share in a public, family setting while the other is not.   I'm not missing your point at all. I just disagree with it.   I'm not denouncing fetishists at all, either. I just think that, while it's fine to be proud of your fetishes, it's not fine to share them in a place intended to be family friendly. If there are places sectioned off for them at pride, by all means, let them take part. But they shouldn't be showing off their fetishes in a family setting. It's just not appropriate."

LGBTeens,3c13bz,Gabsreddithole,-2,Sat Jul 4 14:49:23 2015 UTC,"Debatably that's the parent's fault, or the pride itself for not being more obvious that it handles adult material.  But let's be real here, you are taking your kid to pride, which is ALL ABOUT sexual content, while not explicit sexual content, but things like sexual identity, gender identity, all that.  I think it's more on the fault of the parent, but I doubt they care, it may seem weird, but to the kid it's probably not that weird, kids are very accepting unless otherwise taught to not be as such, and when you raise open kids, you raise brighter kids that are more willing to tackle issues.  Basically, I doubt the kids care about that person in a rubber doggy mask, as long as they aren't, ya know, doin it, I bet the parents, if they are offended, didn't think through what they were bringin their kids too."
LGBTeens,3c13bz,intheirbadnessreign,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:09:20 2015 UTC,"i think the main thing that's happening is that most fear what they don't understand.  much like conservative (insert religion here)'s that don't understand homosexuality or transgenderism (i have no idea what the term is sorry if it is offensive). if we don't understand something we immediately knock it off as not being normal and thus we consider it ""weird"". i guess you could say that we are part of the bully paradox. when one person is bullied they go on to bully a different group to fit in with the initial group. so again we get bullied as ""un-natural"" and ""not normal"" so some of us go and find an extreme of some fetishes and say ""yeah?... well, at least im not that."" to make them seem more ""normal"" and almost tolerable.  by no means is bullying of any sort right. i really don't like it. what turns you on is your business i don't care what you do with it. show it in public pride? sure, whatever (it is about freedom of expression after all). people wont agree with it but that's what you get when you aren't the majority."

I am a very masculine guy, and by that i get people saying ""I don't seem like a real gay guy"". and since i'm a masculine gay i see that other gays think that i wouldnt date a feminine gay (Even though it's my fetish).  Let's all just remember we are together in this and help eachother out"
LGBTeens,3c13bz,TrainsILike,0,Sat Jul 4 00:55:44 2015 UTC,"The stereotypical ""you don't seem gay"" this is a whole mother problem, and IMO, it is the reason so many gay people judge each other . They want to distance themselves from that stereotype, so they attack those who embrace it."
LGBTeens,3c13bz,skinnyjeantwat,5,Sat Jul 4 01:32:10 2015 UTC,"Agreed. A lot of effeminate gay men get shit for being 'annoying' or 'obnoxious', and some might very well be, but their sexuality has nothing to do with it. Some might think that these people annoying and obnoxious, note that they are gay, and associate them with each other. It's a false equivalence. There are annoying and obnoxious straight people too.  EDIT: Wording."

LGBTeens,3c13bz,Alt2PointOh,3,Sat Jul 4 00:46:40 2015 UTC,But you are setting a double standard. It's okay for women to be feminine but when a man is feminine it's annoying. Do you not see the problem in that?

LGBTeens,3c13bz,ravenDivinity,-3,Sat Jul 4 01:34:01 2015 UTC,"but how can one gay guy be more gay than another? he seems to have an idea that being ""really gay"" means being ""really feminine"". hes got a straight acting vs gay acting mindset, which is really destructive to both sides."
LGBTeens,3c13bz,JRPGpro,2,Sat Jul 4 02:46:54 2015 UTC,"He's saying he dislikes gay men who adopt a feminine personality to fit with the gay stereotype. He's not imposing gender roles on anyone, saying someone's more gay than the other, or saying they're less of a man. He's expressing an entirely legitimate opinion, which you are misinterpreting to be much more negative than it really is."
LGBTeens,3c13bz,eversoslightly767,2,Sat Jul 4 03:58:29 2015 UTC,"thank you. Apologies for being so rude about it last night, I was quite drunk. But yes that is the point I'm trying to make. This is not about gender roles. I'm not setting up rules for society either. Naturally the majority of woman are effeminate, the same goes for men who are masculine. I'm not saying it's not okay for them to be however they want to be. I'm saying that camp guys tend to force the persona and put it on more than necessary to become someone they are not. It's a very boring persona. Me and all the other gay/Bi guys in my town are very detached from any scene like this. as a result none of us are camp.   I understand that some people are naturally camp. But a lot of people force it upon themselves and it gets very irritating. They lose all personality and become these boring fannies who talk about little other than clothes and boys and dicks.  When so many people put this on, it gives out an incorrect image of our community and people begin to think being gay is a lifestyle choice and that we're all irritating.  I've met so many people who've said to me that I and my friend have turned them around. they used to be very weary of gays and disliked the idea of them because the only images they'd ever been shown of them are boring shells of men who are openly dull and super camp.

Personally, I came out to my mom while we were driving on the freeway (which in retrospect, could have ended badly :p) and it went very smoothly.

Like if you do it with somebody you love, it's a lot better (personally). But if you are going to hookup, always be safe. And there's a chance that you could catch legitimate feelings for the person you hook out with. The counter argument is ""oh it's just for pleasure, no feelings attached!!"" but sooner or later somebody will catch feelings and shit will hit the fan. Also, make sure the person is clean, if they're willing to hook up with you, chances are they've hooked up with others."

LGBTeens,3c0cs5,ValleDaFighta,9,Fri Jul 3 17:11:03 2015 UTC,"I'll try that! Thank you. I /am/ going to Pride on Sunday, so I'll a) have a gay talking point and b) get lots of free rainbow gear, so. Good plan! Thanks."
LGBTeens,3c0cs5,monkey_gamer,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:17:59 2015 UTC,Where can one get rainbow stickers/pins?
LGBTeens,3c0cs5,ValleDaFighta,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:17:36 2015 UTC,Well here in sweden you can buy them most places stickers/pins are sold.
LGBTeens,3c0cs5,excelssior,3,Sat Jul 4 12:33:07 2015 UTC,"hugs this is me rn too   My crush has complimented me tons before (calling me beautiful/perfect) but I just don't know if it's friendly or flirty. And yesterday I messaged her to invite her somewhere and she just never answered :(  I think you should mention Pride and basically come out to her! She sounds nice, it's unlikely she'd be homophobic, right? Maybe leave the hint-dropping until after you've seen her reaction to you being gay. If she's straight I doubt she would be weirded out as long as you're kind of casual about it."
LGBTeens,3c0cs5,emeraldfoxx,2,Sat Jul 4 09:47:46 2015 UTC,"hugs I feel your pain! Straight crushes aren't that bad if you know for sure they're straight, but it's even worse if you're not sure  -__-"
LGBTeens,3bzbpi,ThatBiTeenager,12,Fri Jul 3 10:57:03 2015 UTC,"I have to say the thing I hate most about people answering these types of questions is that they always say ""Don't force labels upon yourself"" or something like that.  I can't speak on your behalf, OP, but for me I want labels and having responses like that really doesn't help me.  Anyway, to answer your question, you do sound like a biromantic homosexual, but I can't really answer that for you - It's kinda something you need to answer for youself"
LGBTeens,3bzbpi,xCub3d,5,Fri Jul 3 12:52:42 2015 UTC,"Oh my god thank you >_> I always see those comments and it's like,  ""Really? Can't you just tell them what they want to know?"""
LGBTeens,3bzbpi,SoulConduit,6,Fri Jul 3 17:41:06 2015 UTC,"The reason most people say this is because there is really no definitive answer. Sexuality is fluid. In most people it isn't set in stone. Take me for example; I constantly switch between finding women sexually appealing to not being turned on by them at all, where as men almost always catch my eye. Am I gay? Am I bisexual? Am I somewhere between? Who knows?  The most important thing that most of us want to get across is that you don't need to pin down and label your sexuality perfectly. Like what you like and don't worry about it too much or else it'll stress you out. Just do you boo."
LGBTeens,3bzbpi,Pokebow,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:10:48 2015 UTC,I'm only speaking from experience to be honest.
LGBTeens,3bzbpi,xCub3d,4,Sat Jul 4 10:32:49 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd define that as biromantic homosexual, but don't push labels upon yourself if you don't feel comfortable with them."
LGBTeens,3bzbpi,OpinionToaster,2,Fri Jul 3 11:53:14 2015 UTC,"Either biromantic homosexual, or just gay."
LGBTeens,3bzbpi,burke828,2,Fri Jul 3 19:17:44 2015 UTC,"Not many people know, but being bisexual doesn't mean you like men 50% and women 50%. You can be like that, but it's not always the case. You for instance, could like guys quite often, but randomly see a female you find attractive. It's completely normal, and you have nothing to worry about.   Have a good day! :D"
LGBTeens,3bzbpi,AmIARealPerson,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:10:51 2015 UTC,I was in that situation not long after I turned 16 where I identified as Bi but I wasn't really sure but as time went by I realised I was gay. Don't worry too much about it yet.
LGBTeens,3bzbpi,CatalystBeast,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:34:39 2015 UTC,"I would be very similar as well. While I do identify as bi, I would really only have a sexual attraction to guys. That said I could see myself in a relationship would a female that would have a sexual component."
LGBTeens,3bzbpi,ThatGayGuy00,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:58:35 2015 UTC,Your explaining me and I identify as biromanic homosexual
LGBTeens,3bzbpi,Wearethefoxes,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:54:54 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this could help but I was in the same place as you really. And personally, for me, I couldn't see myself happy in a long term relationship with a woman. Although I might still find them attractive on some level, I identified as gay from then on.   Also try to place yourself on the Kinsey scale? Maybe it'll help you try to figure out your label. Good luck! :)"
LGBTeens,3bzbpi,thatdudewholurks,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:03:59 2015 UTC,"This sounds an awful lot like me. I'm a sixteen year old boy who likes boys and girls. I find that I have a variance in which I ""prefer."" I stick with bisexual because it sums up my feelings the fastest. I understand the importance of labels because I felt very scared and confused before I found who I was. I'm open to talking if you want."
LGBTeens,3bzbpi,RockyHeart,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:07:51 2015 UTC,"I don't get why people say ""don't use/force labels"" i'm like, everything is labeled wheter you like ir or not. Even if you constantly change your sexuality or your sexuality is fluid, i think that's called ambigous sexuality.  Anyway, the point is that if you don't like labels, fine, and if you do like them, it's ok also. The thing is that they exist for EVERYTHING. Yup, i said it."
LGBTeens,3bzf2a,mailnosnam,2,Fri Jul 3 11:38:56 2015 UTC,"It's shit to be left out like that, especially when it's basically unavoidable because of your age. I remember feeling like that. That guy gives me weird vibes. I mean he made out with the back of your ear and claims to be straight? I think he has some things going on man."
LGBTeens,3bzf2a,intheirbadnessreign,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:08:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, the age thing really sucks. However, he's never actually claimed to be straight, because he's never really had to really, i mean that night i saw his eyes follow a waitress across the room and we all know the eyes dont lie, he is a full-blooded male. I havent brought up the kiss thing either because I dont want to be awkward or look for things /feelings that aren't there, i have convinced myself it was platonic :("
LGBTeens,3bzf2a,intheirbadnessreign,2,Fri Jul 3 23:34:30 2015 UTC,"Idk man, I wouldn't call making out with your ear a platonic gesture, but maybe he has different standards. I'm not trying to give you false hope, but the evidence suggests to me that he isn't entirely straight. Bi is always an option :)"
LGBTeens,3bzb4v,Kristler,3,Fri Jul 3 10:49:26 2015 UTC,"Not really, but I hope you and anyone else who goes has a good time :)"
LGBTeens,3bzb4v,farieniall,7,Fri Jul 3 22:18:19 2015 UTC,Not really. It's going to be another one of those awkward conventions for little kids.
LGBTeens,3bzb4v,YukisLyrics,2,Fri Jul 3 19:13:31 2015 UTC,"Hey, the footage that comes out of it is pretty interesting to watch at least, the awkwardness is painful"
LGBTeens,3bzb4v,MCEire,2,Sat Jul 4 16:34:05 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, I think they should try and gain ""more confidence"" before setting up a convention. The whole entire livestream so far has been so awkward."
LGBTeens,3bzb4v,YukisLyrics,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:29:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah but then again, it's a bunch of adults trying to answer questions by 4-13 year olds along the lines of ""Will there be new minecarts? :)))"" it's bound to be awkward"

LGBTeens,3byb5a,bkvchan,20,Fri Jul 3 04:04:53 2015 UTC,"You didn't screw up at all. It's for the better really. They're better off not being in your life. They clearly don't care enough for you, so it's good that you got rid of them as fast as possible."

LGBTeens,3byb5a,TheLivingNarwhal,14,Fri Jul 3 04:08:04 2015 UTC,It is okay. You got rid of a bunch of fake friends. It's better to not have anyone than people who are only pretending.
LGBTeens,3byb5a,TheLivingNarwhal,11,Fri Jul 3 04:10:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I get what you mean, thanks :)"

LGBTeens,3byb5a,MayaMaia,5,Fri Jul 3 04:13:05 2015 UTC,"Some of my friends are like that, too.(closeted so they don't judge me, yet.) Honestly, you're just better off without people like that in your life. Make some actual friends that aren't homophobic and are supportive of you, I know it's super hard to find people that support you sometimes but you'll make some awesome real friends that support you no matter what, I promise! :)"
LGBTeens,3byb5a,Jimi_19,6,Fri Jul 3 04:50:28 2015 UTC,It's not your fault. It's their fault for being arseholes.   It's really sucky that they reacted that way. They were still your friends after all. But really they're not worth it... Still hurts though.
LGBTeens,3byb5a,A1103,6,Fri Jul 3 09:52:46 2015 UTC,"No hon, you did nothing wrong.Being gay is a part of you, no matter how small. It makes no sense that people that actually care for you and your well being would look past you as a person for the simple reason you prefer boys to girls. Imagine any other situation this could be applied to. Imagine people who you met online and talked regularly for years decide to meet you in real life and promptly  completely cut off relations with you because you're tall, asian, black, short, what have you. People like this are not ""friends"" and never will be. Although it sucks now, you're better off in the long run."

LGBTeens,3bxy8g,humanysta,11,Fri Jul 3 04:48:17 2015 UTC,"It's like a slightly older version of reddit, and essentially the exact same thing happened that resulted in its death - They wanted to stay in a constant state of where they were at that moment and not change out staff which started to de-rank, hide, or just downvote things they did not like. IIRC After some emails and stuff was released, the head person stepped down, and soon after digg was sold putting the final nail in the coffin."
LGBTeens,3bxy8g,JRPGpro,3,Fri Jul 3 04:55:16 2015 UTC,"Man, that's crazy. I hope that doesn't happen to us."

LGBTeens,3bxy8g,dobby3698,3,Fri Jul 3 15:15:16 2015 UTC,Yeah that's actually the story. Digg v4 made is easier for power users to get top posts while other users had a hard time. That was the nail in the coffin that send digg users running to reddit.
LGBTeens,3bxy8g,Clauskurausu,0,Fri Jul 3 17:36:09 2015 UTC,I still think that if admins just continue to ban and fire people it will not have any real impact unless they change the way reddit works.
LGBTeens,3bxy8g,starryeyedprincess,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:38:09 2015 UTC,Well so far I don't think there has been any banning happening. Just they fired Victoria. And now the reddit secret Santa guy came out and said he got fired a while back. I think the admins need to come out and say why Victoria was fired. Once that happens I assume things will calm down.
LGBTeens,3bxy8g,Whos_Insane,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:52:41 2015 UTC,"One of the reasons is because the reddit admins wanted to monetize AMAs, and Victoria refused."

LGBTeens,3bytzl,dothetruffleshuffle,3,Fri Jul 3 07:07:57 2015 UTC,Is there any way you can get professional help?
LGBTeens,3bytzl,TheLivingNarwhal,3,Fri Jul 3 07:13:50 2015 UTC,"I think you should talk to her. Her support might make it easier to find outside help (which I know is scary, but there are some really fantastic counselors [etcetera] out there [don't stop looking until you find the right one]).    I was suicidal last year, and I didn't tell anyone until one of my friends was in a similar situation. They were more hurt that I hadn't told them than they would have been if I had just been honest before.    If you want any additional support, please PM me. You aren't alone."
LGBTeens,3bytzl,WanderingSpirit9,2,Fri Jul 3 08:00:08 2015 UTC,"I've been in a very similar situation, and in many ways still am.  I've suffered from depression for 3 or 4 years now, and part of that has meant dealing with lots of thoughts and feelings of suicide.  Sometimes it's so faint and in the background I can almost forget those thoughts are there, and sometimes it's like a drumbeat of ""just do it"", but those thoughts are always with me.  I want to start by saying two things I know you know, but that we sometimes need to hear and say to ourselves out loud.  First, that having these thoughts does not make you weak or broken or bad.  It doesn't mean you don't love the people around you or know how much they love you.  All it means is that you're in pain.   The second thing is that pain is not relative.  It doesn't matter how much worse you think other people have it, pain demands to be felt.  I've got a pretty good life.  I've got friends and family who love me and care for me.  I've never suffered any trauma or abuse or rejection for being gay.  But none of that makes the things I feel any less real, any less legitimate, or makes me or you any less deserving of the care and help we need.  That said, I think you should tell your girlfriend.  I think you need her support and I think you'll feel better not having to keep up the mask you wear, the happy face you put on, with her.  She might not understand at first, but that's ok, help her to understand.  She might say the wrong thing at first, but that's ok, give her a chance to find the right words; or the chance to find out that sometimes there are no right words.  I also think you need to build yourself a support network.  Your girlfriend can be part of it, but so can your parents, and friends, as well professionals--doctors and counsellors.  One of the things you mention is that your not sure how to even bring up these feelings or how the conversation would go.  You might try talking about it in relation to other support you're seeking.  For example, tell your girlfriend you have to see your doctor or a counsellor, and when she asks why that is your opportunity to talk about the feelings you've been having.    In any case, I hope you're hanging in there and get the support you need."
LGBTeens,3bytzl,Justin_123456,2,Fri Jul 3 13:25:53 2015 UTC,It will only get worse and fester the more you hold that shit in. I've never been suicidal but crippling depression felt similar. If you won't talk to go up girlfriend speak to your parents or a counselor if you can. You need to get that out and talk to SOMEONE about it. These aren't the type of problems one solved on their own.

The moderation tools are garbage as it is and we all, every single one of us, absolutely rely 100% on third party tools to keep the subreddits running, if not for these third party tools, managing the communities would be far far far more difficult and annoying and this is annoying as ever loving fuck, because all of the default systems these are stacking on top of suck as it is.  I absolutely loathe the report system as does the rest of the moderation team (And I know personally a few default mods do) and a lot of the other mod tools such as the mod mail which is shit in its own regard.  This entire situation I hope brings light to the admins to show them how fucked they are without us and that they need to listen to what we need to keep their business together. Otherwise they are going to lose the glue that holds these communities together.  We stand in support with the blackout, but for the safety of those that may need us, we will not be blacking out, I apologize if you hoped otherwise but I hope you understand. - Pamander"

LGBTeens,3bxele,KaossTheFox,2,Fri Jul 3 03:13:13 2015 UTC,"Hi, also from the Netherlands.  I have noticed that how people deal with LGBT stuff differs a lot depending on the poeple you are talking to. So that might be tricky. Besides that, many people who are LGBT are mostly quite discrete to my knowing. However, after coming out I was surprise by how many LGBT people I already knew.  If he knows you looked at his phone he might indeed feel violated. So it would be best to keep that silent. If you want to start the conversation I'd come out to him. Chances are he is in a somewhat similair position.  I find it very unlikely that you coming out would harm your relationship, just don't tell him you looked in his phone. If you have any further questions feel free to PM me. I came out when I was 18 so I might also be able to kinda help with that if you'd need advice."

LGBTeens,3bwlko,iamaguyhere,8,Thu Jul 2 19:19:15 2015 UTC,"''it's your first time it should be with someone you care about''   The reason this is important is not ''it's special'' or ''it should be preserved''. Sex, how highly you respect it or not, is going to be very hard your first time. Your first time you might be depressed, or scared and might react badly. You might feel insecure. The reason your first time should be with someone you trust and care for is more to do so that if you do react badly, you have someone to COMFORT you, not a cheap experience who'll leave you go home without a second thought.   ''it's just sex''   The risk here isn't sex, it's that they are a STRANGER. You don't know their sexual history, if they have STI's or not. You don't know if they will assault you. Do you really want your first time to be so riddled with risks? Look back on regret?   I don't care if someone has a lot of sex or is a virgin - but that doesn't change that you should be safe when having sex, and protecting yourself first and foremost, ESPECIALLY when it's your first time and you're inexperienced. You can be taken advantage of real easily."

Make sure that you meet who you wanted to meet, for example make a skype call to be sure that he's real.   Also, especially if you do anal, use protection. You don't want some syphilis, HIV or herpes from strangers. Really important: Don't do it somewhere where it's hard to escape! (like cars, his apartment, hotels, deep forests)"

I loved doing dungeon runs with random groups. I never really got to do raids though (I did try to solo AQ once, but didn't finish it because it's nearly impossible to solo kill C'thun -- I also tried to do it with a group but so many people left so we didn't have enough manpower to kill the second to last boss). I really enjoyed playing, and would totally continue playing if it weren't so expensive.  Dammit, now I really miss the days of playing WoW. It's super fun...I just don't have the means to keep paying for it. WoW may get a little boring or tedious just doing quests and shit, but it gets so fun once you start doing dungeons and raids."

One has to do with how you express yourself (clothing, hair, etc), while the other is who you are. You can be female and wear masculine clothes or vice versa. Gender Identity is more how you feel inside, and how you want to be treated. I see myself as female and wish for others to perceive me that way also. I may have a male body for now but that doesn't change anything about my gender identity.   How do you want others to see you? Would you rather they used she, he, or they?

LGBTeens,3bt3r9,KunstDerFuge,3,Wed Jul 1 23:43:24 2015 UTC,"Labeling yourself is never a bad thing and you shouldn't be ashamed of it if you'd like to. I hold out and am proud of my ""labels"" since they are what liberated me from my depressive state and confusion I had towards my sexuality and gender. I'd like to say that it is common for it to be very fluid when you start exploring into it and it's completely normal to be frustrated or confused at times because of it. Don't look into the specifics of it, just point out the general attractions that all your crushes/likes had. You can also check other sexualities other than the conventional ones in the community. Before, I used to call myself bisexual until I found out about pansexuality and that just seemed to clicked more to me. I say the best way you truly can find yourself is by exploration (I don't mean it in a romantic/sexual btw). Talk to other people that you feel that you see yourself as, or like I said, find other terms/labels that you feel closely identifying as. I'd also like to remind you that you can have a romantic interest in one (or none) and a sexual interest in another. I won't get super deep in details to avoid complexities with your situation, but just know that it is ok and normal to have different interest in certain people in diverse shapes and forms."
LGBTeens,3bt3r9,Yinoa,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:47:15 2015 UTC,"While true you don't need to 'name' your sexuality, sometimes having a word for it can be helpful for some. In a way it's kinda confirmation you're not alone in feeling this that or the other. So there's not really any need to bash labels or say they're not needed."
LGBTeens,3bt3r9,KaossTheFox,2,Wed Jul 1 22:59:04 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about it and don't rush trying to ""figure it out"". Sexuality is fluid. For females you could be more into the dykes (buffer, more athletic aesthetic), I wouldn't call it a fetish but more of a preference. And with guys if you're just crushing on them you do you just want o be romantically involved with one or/and sexually? Because you can be considered a bi(or pan)romantic homosexual, which means your interested in having a relationship with any gender but you're only sexually attracted to your own. And again, don't worry about what you like/don't like, you're never too old to figure it out."

I'll grant that it does give you a fun conversation for afterwards, but the actual movie is you and a stranger sitting together for hours in awkward silence. That's not really a good way to get to know someone.  I'd recommend something more active. Bowling, biking, rock climbing, frisbee, etc. It gives you good conversations while you're actually doing whatever activity you've picked but leaves room for some pauses in case you run out of things to say for a bit.

In the end, it's up to you to figure out, but I might be able to help if you could describe your attraction to the girl.

It's sort of at the point where they both just pretend I'm not gay in hopes that it goes away; all the while avoiding anything about the LGBT community when around me, and then expressing their hatred when I'm not around.  It's frustrating when I see them casually liking posts shared by redneck relatives on facebook that say things like ""Share this if you believe that homosexuality is disgusting and should be made illegal"", etc etc.   Idk~~~~ Didn't mean to add my own rant, but yeah it's annoying af"
LGBTeens,3bmdd3,internetnun,9,Tue Jun 30 13:40:24 2015 UTC,"I can't remember exactly how we got to the topic, but my Dad was talking about how, since God created a man and a woman, and didn't intend for there to be homosexuality, that it was introduced through sin. And because of sin, genetics/evolution somehow happened, causing homosexuality.    Huh.  So anything other than heterosexuality is a punishment from God?  What a sad world view. Why people who believe in God choose to put their Higher Power in these petty boxes will forever be a mystery to me.  It only serves to hurt people."

He wasn't hateful which was good, I guess but he started talking about how eventually we might end up marrying robots and children and started talking about transabled people and how it is basically the same thing as homosexuality.  I was quiet for the whole sermon and a part of the car ride home. I almost lashed out at my sister twice during that ride when she mentioned something from the sermon. I just barely managed to stop myself at the last moment.  My mom knows I am bi but she just tells me to date girls and the feelings will go away."

We have a family friend who is gay, and she told me that if he showed up at Christmas dinner with a boyfriend/husband she would not allow him in the house. She's even said that if I ever ""decided"" I was gay that she would be deeply upset. After the SCOTUS legalized same-sex marriage throughout the U.S., she started quoting bible verses (she acted like this was a new thing, even though SSM has been legal in WA since 2012) and even got mad because I liked a post on Facebook that was complimenting SCOTUS.

Really try and get her comfortable with it (or as close as you possibly can). My advice regarding her parents would be just to not talk to them about her orientation and tell her to do the same. It's completely crappy but sometimes it'll be for the best and less damage will be done to her. The biggest you can do is be there for her 100%, give her support that she needs."

LGBTeens,3bgonf,cheesestrings76,8,Mon Jun 29 22:44:36 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you'll find this useful, but: In all likelihood, the pastor cited Romans 13:1   Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God.   Unfortunately, some ""Christians"" have the propensity to pull such passages out of context, as if the Bible were simply a set of rules--a penal code, if you will. In its entirety, it isn't. Surrounding this passage about Submission to the Authorities are several relatively lengthy sections about love. Romans 12:17,18 give   Do not repay anyone evil for evil... If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. While Romans 13:9-10 states  The commandments, ""Do not commit adultery,"" ""Do not murder,"" ""Do not steal,"" ""Do not covet,"" and whatever other commandment there be, are summed up in this one rule: ""Love your neighbor as yourself"" Love does no harm to its neighbor.""   Do you mind if I ask which denomination you attended? Baptists, for instance, tend to believe in the separation of church and state, as per Matthew 22:21   Then [Jesus] said to them, ""Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's.""   I don't mean to be confrontational, far from it, but it is also unfortunate that sometimes preachers forget that their audience won't always be all Christians, so they can certainly come across as brash or insensitive behind the pulpit.  I know when I talked to my youth pastor about my sexual orientation, he was nothing but compassionate and trustworthy.  TL;DR: I'm not entirely sure why I wrote all this, but maybe it's just to say don't give up on the Church yet. First impressions may not be everything."

LGBTeens,3bgwss,bradfurd,6,Mon Jun 29 03:04:35 2015 UTC,"To be fair not all religious schools are like this. I've been going to religious schools within the same diocese (school district) for all my life and I can't say I'd like to go anywhere else. Not once has the topic of homosexuality come up anywhere and my religion classes have focused on more meaningful topics such as morality and loving others. Most of my friends who have been going to school with me for years are totally cool and open-minded with LGBT stuff and have never once shown any disrespect towards the movement. It's sad that many religious schools do encourage discrimination and hate, but to label religious schools in general as mentally-abusive, gay-hating institutions is a bit much. Just remember that your schooling years are just a fraction of your life and that you will (hopefully) learn to move past your dark times. :)"
LGBTeens,3bgwss,surprisellamas,5,Mon Jun 29 15:23:05 2015 UTC,"Its funny how different religion can be. Im from Australia btw, to add context. My whole junior education (k-12) has been under the same Catholic parish, a parish that runs primary, high schools and senior schools. I don't recall ever being taught that homosexuality was wrong, in fact I don't recall it being mentioned at all. The three schools I attended which were being run by this parish openly hired LGBT teachers. These schools, particularly the senior high school (Yr11-12) protects against the discrimination of LGBTQ students within the school environment, having very strict rules if discrimination occurs. The senior high school I attended also largely supported homosexuality, not just with teachers but with students, allowing them to openly express themselves. There was an issue at another campus, where by a student was unable to present work as it was based on homosexuality, this however lead to huge backlash by students and various teachers.   Whilst I do identify as ""No Religion"" I am pretty amazed that these schools did not promote anti LGBT.    However, I feel much empathy that your experience in a religion based education system was not what you expected and was not as supportive as you may have needed"

Never once until my senior year of high school heard anything from teachers about homosexuality. That year there was some drama about a gay student at the school getting bullied, the teachers condemned the bullying, expelled the bullies, then went on to lecture how it is extremely un-Christian to bully someone and never once condemned the student for being gay or anything like that.   Also, this story from a gay student at a strict Catholic boarding school is another great example at how people abuse the teachings to back up their own bigotry but that it's not what we teach at all."

I live in Sweden, a very accepting country where being homosexual is completely fine.

They accept just about anybody and typically don't speak in any social issues. Our focus is loving everybody and living a Christ like life. However my pastor had to say something about his stance last Sunday (which is that he still believes it's unbiblical but will accept it and love anybody.) Most people agreed at my church. There's no place at least in Christianity that accepts gay marriage completely, for what I've seen. It's a shame. It's bullshit. If we're called to love everybody as Christians then why can't everybody love anyone? And why do we still have to accept the Bible for what it is? It was written by people who sin, and yet we pretend that God advocates it all.

LGBTeens,3bi7xp,thatdudewholurks,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:47:26 2015 UTC,"My advice is not to bother looking for one, or at least actively. At your age, it's probably best to focus on having fun with friends and working hard at school or in your job. Being in a relationship will probably take a major hit to your productivity.   I hope this doesn't sound really negative, it's not meant to be like that. I do recommend you try out new things, meet new people, or get to know your friends' friends. You're more likely to meet genuine nice guys rather than the shifty guys on the internet, which could lead to a positive relationship or simply some great friends.   In other words, you're much more likely to have a really good relationship with a guy if you come across him by chance rather than one where you pursue the ideal of a 'boyfriend'. If you continue to develop yourself, more and more people will be drawn to you. ;)"

LGBTeens,3bg6nv,ShawnReardon,12,Mon Jun 29 03:42:22 2015 UTC,"I don't want kids for a couple reasons.   I don't like children. They have always annoyed me. They're cute when they're someone else's, but I don't necessarily want the responsibility that comes with that.  I don't know how I'd explain gender and sexuality to them. It's hugely important to me, but I don't know at what point or how it would be appropriate to talk with them about it.   Finally, I don't have my own life together, and I doubt I ever really will. How is it fair to add more lives to that confusion?   All that said, I may end up adopting older kids to mostly avoid the first two problems. I don't know that I'll ever solve the third, but I guess I'll just have to wait and see."

I'm gonna adopt. I have a lot of siblings, so some form of my DNA will be passed on through them, at least. And adoption is really great, because a lot of kids don't have homes and I definitely don't like that! So, yeah, adoption for me. :)"

LGBTeens,3bg6nv,cmarenburg,3,Mon Jun 29 03:29:52 2015 UTC,"Not as of now. They look like way too much effort. Nappies, schooling etc. Plus, I don't like the idea of having a little person dependent on me for 18-to-whenever consecutive years. Also, it feels unfair to bring a child into this world, because to me it seems like they get to have a short, (hopefully) enjoyable childhood, suddenly ended by high school and they get to spend the rest of their life enslaved to the economy. Further, I'd have to find someone to have a child with. Someone who I'd like to spend 18-to-whenever years with, which seems unlikely. And there's no way I'm looking after a kid by myself.  Granted all that, I expect my opinion will change with age, as most humans are natural breeders and I imagine that certain psychological processes will ensure that I follow that tradition. For example, who actually chooses to be sexual?"

If you chose to have a kid, you have to be 100% ready to do that, not just for the good things but also the bad.  Too often people will have kids for reasons like these. ""They're cute"" kind of downgrades them to the idea of dolls. And the bloodline thing, if everyone did everything their parents did wed probably be in a lot of trouble.  Look-- I'm not saying that you absolutely shouldn't have kids, but you really should think it over. It's a life-altering decision. You can't just give a kid back if you change your mind."

LGBTeens,3bi7oy,miamckay,2,Mon Jun 29 12:56:04 2015 UTC,"While I understand you're trying to be an ally to the transgender community and to help people ""talk to trans people respectfully"", there are several things in your video that aren't quite... accurate.     First off, saying trans people may have ""big walls and boundaries"" regarding their transition isn't the best terminology. Rather, some trans people wish to keep their private lives their own instead of on public display. It is too often assumed that if someone is transgender, then everyone has the right to know what is in their pants and other personal things. So while it is true that some trans people don't like people asking them questions, it's less because they have ""big walls and boundaries"" and more because they are an average person who wants other people to respect their privacy.   I hear what you're trying to say when you explained how to approach trans people. Like you said, you're not supposed to walk up to someone you heard was trans and ask them a bunch of questions. But the trouble with that section of your video is that you act like it's okay to be friendly with someone so that you can ""get a little bit deeper"". Except... It's not okay. Other people are in no way entitled to know our transition stories, especially if they don't know us personally and if they are only trying to get to know us better just to hear all the dirty secrets of our transition.      ""If you're someone who wants to learn trans-related issues, then yeah, if someone tells you 'that person is trans', that gives you the knowledge that if you want to know about it, this is a person that you should spend a lot of time getting to know, if you want to be able to ask those questions"".     I want someone to hang out with me because they think I'm a cool person to hang out with, not because I'm transgender. Chances are, if the person in question knows the trans person (even a little bit!), then they'll know whether the trans person is okay with being asked questions regarding their transition. For some people, they are really open about it and want to spread awareness about what it means to be transgender. For others, they don't want to talk about that aspect of their life (this could be for a variety of reasons: it could be painful to talk about, it could be something they aren't out to everyone about and don't want to disclose, it could be they know transphobic people and don't want it to spread around school/work). So it's better for people to go by what they know of the trans person then to try to gain the trans person's trust so they can ask invasive questions.     And then we get to the ""asking questions"" section. Now, different people will find different questions appropriate. And, like you have said, it is the trans person's right to refuse to answer these questions. The first question is especially welcome, because asking what gender the person identifies as (as well as what pronouns they use [very important!]) can dispel confusion and help make a conversation civil. The question I like least is ""how have you coped with it all?"" because this question sounds like something you'd ask someone whose dog just died, and who was then laid off from work. Also, the answer to this question may very well be self harm and suicide attempts, so why you would want to bring those to the trans person's mind I have no idea.   Sorry if you weren't looking for anyone's critique, but this is just my two cents (as someone who is transgender)."
LGBTeens,3bi7oy,WanderingSpirit9,3,Tue Jun 30 00:22:47 2015 UTC,"No thats awesome, thank you for watching my video and providing me with some feed back. I'd love to talk more with you because I agree with everything you're saying and would really love you as someone I could run things by. I really do want to be respectful. My intention is to come across the way you speak of, the execution clearly hasn't been satisfactory so for that I'm really sorry.   I suppose the whole point of my video was that, I think ultimately if more people ask questions, more people will understand and thus be sensitive all together regarding transgender people and the struggles they face. I suppose though asking a trans person questions has the potential to be really offensive which is the struggle.   In terms of my point about getting to know trans people. I do get what you're saying about it feeling like I'm trying to say essentially 'fake being friends with them, gain trust, ask questions'. On reflection that could have been said a lot better, so thank you for alerting me to that. I don't mean it at all like that. I suppose I meant a more 'go out and get to know trans people' type message, take time to involve yourself in their world.   I do kinda stand by the 'how are you coping' question. I suppose I don't necessarily wanna imply that you'd push that person for details. But as you said, a lot of a person's transition can involve a large amount of sadness and difficulty with things like self harm and suicide and sometimes you a kindness of someone reaching out and going 'hey are you ok?' can be quite comforting. Again I wanna stress that I don't wanna encourage people to press that person for the details, but I think putting your hand out to someone and opening yourself up as a confidante if that person chooses has the potential to be quite comforting  Again, thank you so much for the feedback, it's given me a lot to think about and to take into account when it comes to future videos."

I suppose the whole point of my video was that, I think ultimately if more people ask questions, more people will understand and thus be sensitive all together regarding transgender people and the struggles they face.     I agree completely, which is why I personally am fine with answering most questions. It really annoys me when trans folks are rude towards people who are just ignorant or confused, though the fact is most of us are simply avoiding the pain we have felt through not being understood or respected.     I suppose I meant a more 'go out and get to know trans people' type message, take time to involve yourself in their world.     I respect that. And you're right, if more people took the time to know us as people, then they'd be able to understand what transgenderism means to us.     Again I wanna stress that I don't wanna encourage people to press that person for the details, but I think putting your hand out to someone and opening yourself up as a confidante if that person chooses has the potential to be quite comforting     You are undeniably correct, and I apologize if my response to that question in the video felt hostile.

You're not going to get any recognition here because of the notorious echo-chamber effect. People here are a little disjointed from reality and would most likely say that the concept of ""kind homophobia"" doesn't exist. It does, and it's just a touch of ignorance, really. I have a long bit that I wrote on homophobia in response to someone else on here that I'll link you to, if I get the chance. Thank you!"

Just ask them if they may have let slip that you're gay. They were drunk, so they may not have realised what they were doing or said something they didn't mean to. But if they did say something, you have the right to know."

And never forget that the people here will always accept you for it :)  As for more practical things, do you want to tell your parents? Do you think they will react well if you tell them? If the answer to both of those questions is yes, consider coming out to them. Having family support is amazing, and i know it's hard (hell, i haven't yet worked up the courage to tell my parents i'm genderqueer myself) but it can be so worth it. You can get hormones if they support you. I don't recommend coming out to them if you expect them to be gross about it though."

LGBTeens,3bckh9,throwaway_0118,8,Sat Jun 27 22:54:42 2015 UTC,"I love seeing pride flags in unexpected places. I was in a parking lot waiting for my dad to come out of a store a few months ago and there was this truck that you would expect some southern, gun-toting, gay-hating person to drive, but it had a little pride flag on the front and it made me smile"
LGBTeens,3bc3g4,Keniree,7,Sat Jun 27 20:17:46 2015 UTC,"He is clearly coming from an area that sexuality and gender is only to be black and white. They are not seeing the grey areas within (and out) it. This in itself can be seen as an ironic, and possibly a bit comical, situation that they have placed themselves in. We have been told and conditioned with the idea that being another sexuality and gender other than what is conventional (cis het) to be bad, abnormal, attention seeking, being confused, etc. This just continues to feed this notion, but onto a more diverse spectrum. The whole image thing isn't going to be more as a huge issue today nor more than it was yesterday. We still live in a time where ALL of our sexualities and genders are invalidated and highly sexualized. The LGBT+ is supposed to help each other and not shame one another for expressing and living who we are (we deal enough shaming and hate as it is with those out of the community). Throwing anyone under the bus isn't going to show any significant let alone positive change, and is just honestly a shitty thing to do since only a certain majority of a group is benefiting off a privilege while the minority gets ignored and invalidated of an actual issue present (may ring a bell). I don't personally know any sources,  but I feel they just need to be more exposed of those in the community (especially those that are trans*/non-binary). They need to hear and try to see from their views. You can spit facts, but that doesn't always get to people easily than experiences. Hope you find a solution to this issue!"
LGBTeens,3bc3g4,Yinoa,2,Sun Jun 28 05:15:16 2015 UTC,"He moved from Poland to Ireland about ten years ago. His parents and   most of his extended family seem to have a lot of homophobic, racist and generally unpleasant sentiments. There could be background stuff there.  It's a bit like ""I can be this, but being ""that"" is just plain silly!"". I'm not going to give up on this though. Being dismissive of anyone because of their sexuality is a super shitty thing to do considering the stuff this guy went through a year or two back.  I get what you're saying and I was thinking of getting a pansexual friend to have a conversation with him about it, if the friend feels like they can help."
LGBTeens,3bc3g4,remhume,6,Sun Jun 28 13:26:24 2015 UTC,"hi, pansexual here i would tell him that there are more than two genders and ""bi"" means two, so some are not fine with calling themself bisexual when they're also into agender and genderfluid people (for example) and all the other genders out there and just don't really care. you can't really deny that. and then you already have it: they don't really care about someone elses gender. so they can feel attracted to people regardless of their gender, and are not just into boys and girls. I see bi as ""being into males and females"" and pan as ""being into humans"" and the important point is that the latter includes more people than the former. Some also say that bi means the same as pan. So pan is a term that i use to state ""I'm clearly not just into boys and girls"". And when he says ""but there are only two sexes: either penis or vagina"" that's not true either because there's a wide range of intersex between ""biologically male"" and ""biologically female""."
LGBTeens,3bc3g4,remhume,5,Sat Jun 27 21:16:44 2015 UTC,"Yup. I'm aware of the distinction between bisexuality and pansexuality, and tried to explain it to him a few times.  It basically goes back to ""Nope, not real!"" which is incredibly frustrating...  He does have some level of respect for transgender people, which came up during the rant on drag, but again, refuses to recognise that there is a more accurate, real term for attraction to all people regardless of gender."
LGBTeens,3bdjug,Midnightstation,5,Sun Jun 28 05:06:12 2015 UTC,Just because you say no to dating the lady doesn't mean your gay if you get what im saying...Just tell her you aren't looking for a relationship right now and go on about your business

It's fairly normal to go on a date with someone and then realise you're not that into them. I totally realise why this seems like a big deal to you, but it's not - just tell her (nicely) that you don't want a relationship with her. There's no need to come out as gay until you're comfortable and ready."

Hear my out guys i just hate when people say all conservatives suck becauseni think the core beliefs of being a conservative are different than what a select few people who are actually uber religious traditional bigots believe.

You have already decided to delay the suicide by some extent, which shows to me you're not in a hurry.  If high school drives you this far, high school is more detrimental to your future than it is helpful. Get away by any means necessary, even if you have to visit a LGBT/homeless shelter.  Also consider that relief from pain is a feeling, and you don't have feelings when you're dead. In other words, suicide won't bring you relief.  There is a chance you haven't contacted the police. I happen to understand why somebody in your situation wouldn't likely contact the police. It is basically a terrifying unknown, so I ask you, which one is more desirable, suicide, or calling the police?  If it does come down to it, do whatever you can to diminish any emotions you have. This might seem like a bad idea, but consider that you will be able to at least partially reverse it later, and that the anticipated final outcome is still better than death.  I will end this with a request. Well, I guess it is more of a command the way I have phrased it: Live through this, even if you can't find a reason, live through this just because I tell you to.  I will also send this in a PM in hopes of better chances to reach you"

I don't get upset over who I am because that is something out of my control. I never sat down and decided I wanted to be gay. But, I'm not going to let it bring me down. It only enhances my traits. I'm not saying that I've never been depressed. The thought of suicide has crossed my mind before. But then I thought, why would I end my life because people didn't like me. Because people didn't like a part of me I had no control in. In what world does that make any sense. Who cares what people think. If someone is upset by me then they are the ones that need to deal with that. Not me. Not you.   If your household is really against you and anything about you, then you shouldn't be there. You said that you have a supportive sister, great then your not alone in our home. If you can't mouth the words "" I'm gay "" there's nothing wrong with that. It's the hardest sentence for any gay person to say. When you want to come out to her, try telling her a different way. Through text or a note or anything really.   Please remember that You are loved. Whether you don't feel like it, or you want to deny it. You are loved. If not your family, then by others.  the lgbt community loves you. I feel for everyone that has a hard time coming to terms with being gay. And My heart aches every time I read about another lgbt youth committing suicide, because I've been there. that could've been me. And I don't want that to be you.   It's two a.m. So sorry if this doesn't really make sense. Also I'm on mobile so excuse any spelling or grammar. Message me back if you want. Good night. :)  Thought this was a PM, DAMN YOU MOBILE.

But you also do that when you go to college, or move, or stop going to whatever joint activity you have.  The point is; you can go after him, just don't rush it. And when things go wrong: Talk.  Especially when you have a joint friend group things will be awkward, but it'll go better eventually since you can't avoid eachother.  Life's too short to regret. Aside from that: I have seen relationships within friend groups work out."
LGBTeens,3b9jtw,Clubblendi,3,Sat Jun 27 10:53:39 2015 UTC,Friends with benefits don't work and it isn't worth trying. Your either gonna have to stay friends or risk losing a friend for going at him for a relationship. You can always just ask him to try dating you for a while and if it doesn't work it doesn't.

Do something fun for yourself, whether it's getting ice cream with rainbow sprinkles or listening to Same Love on repeat. Have a party with yo self!! Do whatever you'd do to party about this with a friend even if you aren't out enough to actually have someone else with you.  Internet hugs because I know how hard it is being closeted.

I can't even imagine what that must be like, but it makes me so sad. I hate how religions twist people up about the beautiful things in life like love and sexuality. It hurts so many people so much.  Know that most of the wider world around you accepts and celebrates you, and loves you unconditionally, just as you are.  Do your best to be positive and work hard towards a future where you can be a mentally and physically free adult with a bright future ahead of you.

LGBTeens,3b7scx,Leamons,12,Fri Jun 26 18:35:48 2015 UTC,"Honestly, there really wasn't a ""coming out"" at our house, because sexual orientation is a non-issue in our house. (Our kids are 25, 15, 13, & 9).  As I was putting some brownies into the oven, my daughter bounced over, bubbling with happiness, excited to share with me the news, that, ""As of today, I am officially in a relationship!""   Turns out that she and her BFF had secretly been madly in love with each other for quite some time, and finally shared that information with each other, resulting in a well-thought out, joint decision to enter official coupledom.  The news and the specifics of it were not surprises to me or her father.  It was more ""last piece of the puzzle"" that is our daughter, so to speak. After all, you can only know your child up to a point.  After that, all you really know is what they choose to share with you.    I was really happy that she was both comfortable with herself and so dedicated to keeping her end of our line of communcation open with us that she chose to share her happiness with us at the developmental milestone of her first teenage romance.    We talked about it after the big announcement, and why in particular she decided to ""come out"" to us in precisely the way she did.  She said she knew that it wouldn't be an issue at all for us that she was gay, and that ""one wouldn't come out as a a heterosexual"", so why should one come out as a homosexual? Therefore, the only thing that makes sense is to announce when you are in a relationship.  So, that's what she did.  After her announcement, I hugged her and expressed my happiness for her.  And then we both went on with our day.  They really do make a cute couple, and seem to be very much in   love.  We're so happy for them.  They have the love and support of every one around them: family, friends, school.  It's beautiful, all around, and I hope that the world stays that way for them (and everyone of a similar identity), forever.  Because that's that way it should be: love between two people should always be celebrated.  It's the best thing in the world, period.  We should all be so lucky to find love one day.  True, unconditional love transforms lives and makes the world a better place."

LGBTeens,3b7scx,that_second_account,2,Fri Jun 26 22:40:40 2015 UTC,"Very sweet. Thank you.  Two things help me when someone dissapoint me. One is more positive than the other, but one/the other/both will be something useful for you to file away in your head.  First, I assume that everyone's doing the best that they can for them, at any given time, for whatever reason.  It's an optimistic view that is easier to direct outward than inward (which is sometimes where I need it most), but the thought helps me.  Second, (and I hate this idea, but had to admit its merits once I was introduced to it), lower the bar.  You have to lower your expectations of people in order to avoid dissapointment.  Sometimes (most times, hopefully), you'll be pleasantly surprised, but when you're let down, it won't hurt so bad.  One last thought I'll share that I've seen with age is that change is inevitable.  Nothing stays the same forever.  Sometimes everything about life is really awesome, and other times it's not.  But either condition, and every one inbetween, is transient."

LGBTeens,3b89pn,Hikaru_Maikeru,4,Sat Jun 27 01:39:37 2015 UTC,I'd probably go for:  1) Immortality 2) The ability to teleport 3) And ability to control time  And if a could have a fourth it be to have a meaningful relationship.
LGBTeens,3b89pn,Hikaru_Maikeru,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:01:14 2015 UTC,"I didn't even think about powers, what exactly would you do with your new found powers?  Your answer kind of reminds me of the post a couple of weeks ago on /r/askreddit where someone asked what would you do if you gained immortality but were sent back 50,000 years.  If I had your abilities I would go back in time and train in every fighting style we've made and do stuff like parkour, athletics, that ring thing people post all the time and just train in every skill. Then come back to now and release all my knowledge of the past online for free and also warn everyone about CO2 and stuff. I don't think I'd go into the future because I don't want to see it."

I've recently came out to 2 of my friends and my cousin as bi-sexual. How I did it was over the phone (friends live in different states). I always started with asking them how they are doing and have a casual conversation, because it makes me feel good and makes me realize what I'm about to tell them isn't that big of a deal. Once conversation gets dull that's when I begin to tell them. I kinda boast about them saying  "" I have to tell you something that I find very important to me. I'm telling you this because you are one of my good/best friends that I find to be very understanding and trusting, also I feel like I can go to for anything."" Then tell them.  Idk this is what I've been doing and but to works for me. So maybe you do it over the phone instead of in person or maybe you should write a letter since you don't have to be there and you can confront it later. But take your time! There is no rush and it is easier the more you tell people and you also feel better the more people know.   Good luck and I hope this helped!!!  P.S sorry for it being so long!!!"

It's something that affects gays a lot more than others, no one else can understand the pain that is felt by knowing it is biologically impossible for your crush to love you back.   It's always going to feel shit, but least we get closure. Perhaps it's easier to move on if you know your love will always remain unrequited... I don't know. I'm sorry he wasn't straight, but he sounds like a great person to be around. When your crush on him disappears you'll be left with a fantastic friendship that both of you will greatly value."

LGBTeens,3b4vs3,oredda323,2,Fri Jun 26 00:07:34 2015 UTC,"One simple label you could use is queer. It includes every aspect of your gender and sexuality since it's kind of a cover-all sort of term. It's not exactly as personal, but it might work for your own personal definition.   You could also try coming out without using labels, but instead by using their definitions. So instead of saying ""I'm panromantic"" you could say ""I'm attracted to people of any gender"". That way, you don't confuse people with complicated labels."

LGBTeens,3b10sx,Risvoi,3,Thu Jun 25 05:20:35 2015 UTC,I think that as much as you may want him to be gay/bi you have to trust what he says. He is the only one who can know for sure anyways.

Always use the manual sign ins. My first advice is for you to sever the connection of your tinder with your facebook, as you're really just connecting a huge database who has been collecting everything you write, look at, read,watch and listen; where, in what and for how long, in an extensive period of time.  Now on to the question  at hand, I don't think using facebook in this case is going to do a whole lot, but if you really, really want to be sure about it, you shouldn't connect with the plugin."

LGBTeens,3azufi,Jimi_19,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:20:56 2015 UTC,my basic understanding of it is that tinder uses facebook as quality control or something?
LGBTeens,3azufi,Ghostlupe,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:26:14 2015 UTC,"Tinder will only give you a list of people based on distance, gender, and age.  If you only want girls, it'll only show girls. If you want guys, it'll only show guys. And of course you can ask for both. You won't know a person's sexuality unless they explicitly state in their bio.   So even if someone from your school saw your Tinder account on their list, they can't really infer anything. If a straight girl is looking for guys, you'll show up to them even if you're a gay man.   You also can't interact with people unless you've been matched, which is always a plus."

So if another guy sees you, they will know that you also selected to see guys.    But if worse comes to worse, you can always say that you just selected that to see what other guy's profiles were like, and didn't know the information I just conveyed to you."

One of the ones we had was lemon meringue; it had a big layer of meringue on top. While walking back to the metro, I noticed he had some meringue on his lip.  Me: ""You have some meringue on your lip.""  Him: ""So do you."" [kisses me]  Me: [dies]"
LGBTeens,3avz01,Jodabomb24,15,Wed Jun 24 00:41:33 2015 UTC,melts
LGBTeens,3avz01,emeraldfoxx,10,Wed Jun 24 02:24:26 2015 UTC,I would literally melt into nothing right there :P
LGBTeens,3avz01,SimplyNigh,2,Wed Jun 24 00:48:19 2015 UTC,So romantic.
LGBTeens,3avz01,CTofInfinity,12,Wed Jun 24 12:51:14 2015 UTC,"We decided to hang out at his house one day, and he said he had a surprise for me in his bedroom (it's SFW don't worry) so he suddenly picked me up and set me down on his bed while we cuddled, ate cookie dough, and watched Netflix."
LGBTeens,3avz01,Modern-day-Gypsy,2,Wed Jun 24 02:51:28 2015 UTC,The real meaning of watching netflix and chill.
LGBTeens,3avz01,MDMA_zing,9,Wed Jun 24 22:57:46 2015 UTC,"My fiancé brought me flowers to work unexpectedly and it was so thoughtful, right now he is in Phoenix for a month training and it sucks without him."
LGBTeens,3avz01,MDMA_zing,5,Tue Jun 23 23:20:02 2015 UTC,That's nice :) but it really does suck that he's gone for so long!
LGBTeens,3avz01,Valladium,5,Wed Jun 24 00:47:05 2015 UTC,I know he is becoming a flight attendant and pursuing his dreams while I'm over here wondering what my dream is still lol.
LGBTeens,3avz01,CatNamedFelix,17,Wed Jun 24 04:39:13 2015 UTC,"I woke up, and he was just pressing his hand on my cheek while I slept. <3  I had been sleeping with my hand on my face. So loving."
LGBTeens,3avz01,postmodern_cereal,12,Wed Jun 24 01:15:37 2015 UTC,I had been sleeping with my hand on my face. So loving.   Biggest plot twist of the century haha
LGBTeens,3avz01,Jodabomb24,5,Wed Jun 24 04:48:28 2015 UTC,"My bf came to visit me recently (we are currently long distance) and was consequently fired for leaving 5 minutes early in order to catch his train. Despite losing a job he loved, he told me today that it was all worth it (swoon). You'll find yourself a man, op. I was in exactly the same boat as you a year ago, and now I've got myself the best guy I could ever want. Crazy as it sounds, you'll find someone."
LGBTeens,3avz01,Leamons,7,Wed Jun 24 04:04:20 2015 UTC,"Man, his boss sounds like a total wazzock."

LGBTeens,3avz01,MysteryMoniker,3,Wed Jun 24 09:02:37 2015 UTC,"We talked about him taking me to his prom and I was super excited for it, but said that he would have to get flowers for me. No prmoposal because I didn't want him to go through all that effort, just flowers.   He shows up at my door in a shabby Link costume and a sign that says ""I heard prom was going to be SMASHING"" (we both love Super Smash Bros"". And of course, flowers."

LGBTeens,3ayezk,TheLivingNarwhal,2,Wed Jun 24 22:32:56 2015 UTC,Yup
LGBTeens,3ayezk,TheLivingNarwhal,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:04:53 2015 UTC,"I have only heard 2 of her songs, Call Me Maybe and I Really Like You. Call me Maybe was okay, but I Really Like You lacked depth and original lyrics. Definitely one of my least favorite songs."
LGBTeens,3ayezk,TheLivingNarwhal,2,Thu Jun 25 04:11:09 2015 UTC,"I Really Like You isn't really representative of the album. I'd said Emotion it's like combining Madonna's early work with Synth-pop, but with Carly more bubblegummy voice and simple lyrics. If you like depth lyrics, it's not your album :C"
LGBTeens,3ax2ro,alittledropofdreams,9,Wed Jun 24 04:57:34 2015 UTC,I usually prefer guys. At this point though having a pulse is the only requirement.
LGBTeens,3ax2ro,Leamons,2,Wed Jun 24 05:49:02 2015 UTC,Ha gotta have a line somewhere eh
LGBTeens,3ax2ro,AerMarcus,4,Wed Jun 24 06:23:38 2015 UTC,Yup. Mine just happens to be at the very bottom. XD
LGBTeens,3ax2ro,Leamons,9,Wed Jun 24 06:37:26 2015 UTC,"Guys are hot. Girls are hot.  Basically, I'm up for anyone attractive who's also attracted to me haha."
LGBTeens,3ax2ro,ToanDaxland,5,Wed Jun 24 05:12:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah... honestly, I would date almost anyoneihavestandards if they wanted to date me too right now."
LGBTeens,3ax2ro,ToanDaxland,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:19:58 2015 UTC,"That is exactly how I feel, hahaha.  I talk about relationships and dating so much (when I'm not talking about medicine or gaming) that my close friends always wonder if I'll date anyone.  ""I do have standards.. >> <<"""
LGBTeens,3ax2ro,transandpans,3,Wed Jun 24 05:55:35 2015 UTC,"Very fluid for me. I'm always attracted to people of every gender, but the strength of the attraction varies a lot, even day to day."
LGBTeens,3ax2ro,FireImpossible,2,Wed Jun 24 05:35:48 2015 UTC,"I'm pan, but I think I can still contribute. Yes and no. Yes, it does change for me (although currently I'm dating this amazing girl) and my overall attraction can lean one way or the other. But no, it usually doesn't go for whoever I'm around. Basically I'll have a crush on someone if I do. then again, I hang out with a varying group of people when it comes to gender. I'm surrounded by people of all genders so I basically always have the ability to date who I want.  So yeah, I hope this helps"
LGBTeens,3ax2ro,CynicalCarrots,2,Wed Jun 24 07:11:36 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure I'm pan, which is similar.  I drool over androgynous people.  Sometimes that fluctuates over to masculinity, sometimes to femininity.  I can't really explain it well.  But then again, I'm open to anything, really.  If you're funny and flirty I've probably envisioned holding you.    Kinsey Scale????  Uh...4?  But then again, I don't take sexuality too seriously.  Just live and love and eat."
LGBTeens,3ax2ro,KaossTheFox,2,Wed Jun 24 19:34:45 2015 UTC,I don't really see gender... at all really. A pulse and a good personality is all I ask for honestly.
LGBTeens,3ax2ro,AerMarcus,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:26:13 2015 UTC,"Really depends on the guy or girl, -though I'm attracted to more guys than girls but still."

LGBTeens,3ax2ro,GizmoMachine,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:34:41 2015 UTC,I have a strong preference for girls. I'd rather be with girls romantically and physically. But I cannot help being attracted to guys. If you can handle a witty back and forth conversation then you've got me.
LGBTeens,3ax2ro,Calubedy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:52:09 2015 UTC,"My buddy calls it the bicycle, like bi-cycle. He fluctuates between wanting girls a little and a lot, and always is up for guys.  I on the other hand am always up for girls, but sometimes a gay guy gets me going."
LGBTeens,3aug9j,baheeprissdimme,13,Tue Jun 23 16:32:48 2015 UTC,I'm surprised that there were pan booths but no bi booths. It seems like the bi representation would come before the pan.
LGBTeens,3aug9j,nodice13,4,Tue Jun 23 21:18:40 2015 UTC,That's what I was thinking
LGBTeens,3aug9j,FireImpossible,2,Wed Jun 24 01:19:53 2015 UTC,"Same here. Though personally I'm glad they were there, I feel like since there are more bi people they need the representation more. I am willing to wait if it means that others can be represented."

LGBTeens,3aug9j,TheLivingNarwhal,15,Wed Jun 24 01:19:14 2015 UTC,"As far as pride and ""non-heterosexuality"" goes, bisexuality is kinda like, the blandest of the dishes, so to speak. You've still got that half hetero part of you so it's understandable that in a world where people are finding new things to love that bisexuality is less embellished. No offense and all."
LGBTeens,3aug9j,FireImpossible,9,Tue Jun 23 18:40:14 2015 UTC,None taken. This is actually what I was saying to a friend while we were there. It's like the B isn't even there.
