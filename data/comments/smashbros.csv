smashbros,3dyo1v,FlatlineMonday,246,Mon Jul 20 16:38:15 2015 UTC,That hug from Leffen really means a lot to me. They've come so far since the evidence.zip days <3
smashbros,3dyo1v,Pucciogaeshi,66,Mon Jul 20 17:04:17 2015 UTC,Fun fact: they hugged when Armada won Apex 2013 (similar popoff)
smashbros,3dyo1v,KAP22714,34,Mon Jul 20 19:08:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Leffen used to be Armadas Coach"
smashbros,3dyo1v,projectsquare,25,Mon Jul 20 19:28:05 2015 UTC,"He was sitting next to him at Apex 2013, yes, but I dunno about ""Armada's coach"". It had more to do with him being the 2nd best Swede in the venue. Also shoutouts to Hbox popping off after the fucking RPS in that GF."
smashbros,3dyo1v,Gliffie,9,Mon Jul 20 19:44:35 2015 UTC,"He was more like a sideline coach, and actually did it not only at Apex 2013, but also at Apex 2012 iirc"

smashbros,3dyo1v,lardassed,17,Mon Jul 20 19:39:26 2015 UTC,"For a lot of matches, people have a fellow player sitting with them, giving them advice. It used to be (and still is, at tournaments where coaching is the norm) that Leffen was Armada's coach. At least, that's what I assume projectsquare meant."
smashbros,3dyo1v,CitizenOfSmash,3,Mon Jul 20 19:41:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Leffen used to be Armadas Coach"
smashbros,3dyo1v,likesixhobos,18,Mon Jul 20 19:41:13 2015 UTC,Hbox with the frame perfect fistbump to congrats point really was the best part.
smashbros,3dyo1v,Cave_Weasel,18,Mon Jul 20 19:22:43 2015 UTC,Seeing the popoff live was so chilling and made me feel so happy for Armada. He really earned it. Go Sverige.
smashbros,3dyo1v,Liamrun,5,Mon Jul 20 19:09:17 2015 UTC,"Well, they are two world-class players from Sweden. National blood is thicker than water ya know"

smashbros,3dyo1v,ahampster,93,Mon Jul 20 18:40:30 2015 UTC,I love how Hbox whiffs on the fistbump but adjusts to a point.  Either way I love the gesture because he looks legitimately happy for Armada
smashbros,3dyo1v,Vinylzen,168,Mon Jul 20 17:36:44 2015 UTC,"""As long as it's not Mang0 or Leffen."""
smashbros,3dyo1v,JumpedAShark,34,Mon Jul 20 18:32:06 2015 UTC,yeah cause he totally did that when Mango won last year   /s  edit: ...and he deletes his comment
smashbros,3dyo1v,Ampyy,13,Mon Jul 20 18:30:49 2015 UTC,What be the comment
smashbros,3dyo1v,Vinylzen,21,Mon Jul 20 18:33:43 2015 UTC,"something about Hbox always wanting the spotlight, saying his act towards Armada wasn't a kind gesture but more of a selfish one."
smashbros,3dyo1v,Ampyy,22,Mon Jul 20 18:42:16 2015 UTC,I believe that people who think its selfish to congratulate the winner like Hbox did are selfish themselves. They can't imagine why anyone would do that out of kindness or respect. Everything is about attention.
smashbros,3dyo1v,Nizbel,9,Mon Jul 20 18:59:08 2015 UTC,"And you know these same people would have complained if Hbox had just walked off, stayed out of the spotlight in anyway. Would have said he was being salty and petty to not congratulate Armada."
smashbros,3dyo1v,SageOfTheWise,-10,Mon Jul 20 19:26:31 2015 UTC,"It's not the fact that he congratulated him, it's the whole holding his hand up in the air thing. He did the same thing to M2K at TBH3 and it was annoying then."
smashbros,3dyo1v,disgraced_salaryman,19,Mon Jul 20 19:55:08 2015 UTC,"How is it annoying? You guys are seriously the biggest cry babies. Seriously making our subteddit look bad. There are sooooo many examples of second place competitors doing that to the person that just beat them for first.   It's just because people like you created some ""Hbox is the bad guy"" mentality and jump on the bandwagon of hating him. All of the hate he gets is unwarranted.   People say he's out there for the drama and attention. Did it look like Armada was annoyed by it? No! The guy is just playing a game he loves, get off his back."
smashbros,3dyo1v,RedBomberX,-9,Mon Jul 20 20:08:32 2015 UTC,I can only assume these same people see the final scene of Karate Kid as the opponent getting some kind of final revenge against the main character by touching the trophy first or something.
smashbros,3dyo1v,SageOfTheWise,3,Mon Jul 20 20:24:34 2015 UTC,Lol have you ever met the guy? Everything he does is to get people to like him.
smashbros,3dyo1v,dydtaylor,-7,Mon Jul 20 21:36:45 2015 UTC,Armada and M2K didn't seem to mind. I don't see why any of us should care.
smashbros,3dyo1v,gallyguru,10,Mon Jul 20 20:36:46 2015 UTC,"I think it's more that people think he's putting up a facade. He just lost evo, he can be sad, I'm sure we'd all be fine with that. His gestures simply feel too nice for the moment."
smashbros,3dyo1v,breadburger,0,Mon Jul 20 21:17:00 2015 UTC,Being too nice is a problem. Ok.

smashbros,3dyo1v,billpika,28,Mon Jul 20 19:32:28 2015 UTC,"No but you said a pseudo intellectual and completely irrelevant thing as if you were adding to the discussion. Even if you were right people were talking about if hbox is, relative to others, more attention seeking. Your comment read like trying to say something deep about humanity but really you said nothing at all."
smashbros,3dyo1v,Marshfellow,9,Mon Jul 20 20:44:31 2015 UTC,I'd rather him be sportsmanlike and respectful than a little salty bitch
smashbros,3dyo1v,BananaSack,35,Mon Jul 20 20:48:18 2015 UTC,Like that one guy who's name is fruit.
smashbros,3dyo1v,RedBomberX,13,Mon Jul 20 20:53:31 2015 UTC,Armada gathered the spirit bomb and threw it downwards after winning the set.
smashbros,3dyo1v,Supatony,4,Mon Jul 20 18:34:13 2015 UTC,But Armada did it in 1 episode.
smashbros,3dyo1v,dajachiz,3,Mon Jul 20 20:27:47 2015 UTC,And didn't miss
smashbros,3dyo1v,MnBran6,37,Mon Jul 20 17:59:11 2015 UTC,I would like to think of it as Armada charging it while Hbox was camping.
smashbros,3dyo1v,Supatony,15,Mon Jul 20 19:43:12 2015 UTC,"There's good sportsmanship, and then there's straight love from fellow smashers."
smashbros,3dyo1v,Spiritenemy,9,Mon Jul 20 20:33:46 2015 UTC,"I feel like all the other top players just have a lot of respect for Armada. He doesn't really have beef with anyone like Mango, Leffen, and HBox. He just works really hard and always plays well."
smashbros,3dyo1v,worldchrisis,17,Mon Jul 20 20:48:16 2015 UTC,"that's true, but to see a smile and unhesitated congratulation from hbox and a smile and walk up hug from leffen AT Evo makes me happy."
smashbros,3dyo1v,Spiritenemy,24,Mon Jul 20 18:16:14 2015 UTC,Anyone got the better version of this that was shown at the very end of the stream that was shot from the other side of the stage?
smashbros,3dyo1v,xCYaNoTiK,21,Mon Jul 20 20:28:09 2015 UTC,He really needs to work on spreading his legs for a sturdy base if he's gonna continue with that pop-off (and gonna keep winning). Every time he wins he looks like he's gonna fall over. Pop-off mechanics yo.
smashbros,3dyo1v,TheCyclops,2,Mon Jul 20 20:31:29 2015 UTC,Gotta practice the popoff tech. Luckily his hug into hug combo is looking super crisp.
smashbros,3dyo1v,JaggedToaster12,6,Mon Jul 20 18:11:58 2015 UTC,"He even got the frame perfect flex into hype yell, I'm impressed!"

smashbros,3dyo1v,zzFuzzy,65,Mon Jul 20 19:24:08 2015 UTC,Hbox is weirdly delighted for someone who just lost seconds ago.
smashbros,3dyo1v,thatshootingguy,28,Mon Jul 20 20:45:23 2015 UTC,After beating mango he could've not taken an entire stock in GFs and still been happy.
smashbros,3dyo1v,holographicmew,0,Mon Jul 20 19:34:34 2015 UTC,"I mean, the dude looked like his girlfriend had just had a baby or something when he beat Leffen. Biggest popoff i've ever seen in my life"
smashbros,3dyo1v,OfficerDyke,4,Mon Jul 20 18:59:29 2015 UTC,You didn't think he was happy?
smashbros,3dyo1v,redditorsareretardsx,-1,Mon Jul 20 19:14:43 2015 UTC,What in his comment implied that to you?
smashbros,3dyo1v,RufflesTheMonkey,8,Mon Jul 20 19:37:38 2015 UTC,Because having a baby is literally the worst thing ever according to a fair portion of Reddit.  It was a dumb joke by him.

And man, even watching this back as someone who wanted Hbox to win so badly, it just makes me delighted to see someone that happy."
smashbros,3dyo1v,zzFuzzy,5,Mon Jul 20 21:03:03 2015 UTC,"I definitely wanted Hbox to win too, and yeah, Armada's joy is contagious."
smashbros,3dyo1v,thatshootingguy,2,Mon Jul 20 19:29:12 2015 UTC,It looked like Armada was so pumped he couldn't help but be happy for him.
smashbros,3dyo1v,TwelfthSovereign,45,Mon Jul 20 19:34:07 2015 UTC,"That's what it looks like to me, too. He goes for the fist bump, sees Armada losing his mind, and laughs."

smashbros,3dyo1v,DTGG,19,Mon Jul 20 17:29:59 2015 UTC,You can be genuinely happy for someone and still wanted to win yourself.
smashbros,3dyo1v,marrukt,19,Mon Jul 20 18:41:16 2015 UTC,"Yea but it's tough, that initial feeling of sadness overrides a lot. I'm sure Hbox was smoldering inside (seriously, who wouldn't be?) but props for keeping not a neutral look but one of happiness."

smashbros,3dyo1v,FreezieKO,2,Mon Jul 20 19:04:16 2015 UTC,He wanted nothing more in this world than to stop his rival at the peak of his game. Stopping the 3vo was bigger to him than winning at that point
