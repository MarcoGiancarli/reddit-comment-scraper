boogie2988,3cw9ja,turningantigg,14,Sat Jul 11 08:32:48 2015 UTC,"I said on twitter that j felt she wasn't a good fit the more I read about her.  This has very little to do with choices like banning fph and/or her dedication to safe spaces.    It has more to do with how her tenure at reddit and her reputation have been fully sullied.  Whether it's her lawsuit against her former employer, or her decision to get rid of wage negotiations, or the shenanigans of her husband... doesn't matter.  There is simply too much wood for the pyre for the trolls to work with for her to be a good fit for CEO of this board.  Her ideals and politics aside, both of which are worthy of scrutiny, as a public face of a company she is certainly contrave sial and that makes her a poor fit for reddit."

boogie2988,3cw9ja,Tyrrexel,2,Sat Jul 11 11:57:12 2015 UTC,"I'll elaborate on ""bogus improvements"":   Arbitrary banning of some subs (mostly deserved for the reasons given) while ignoring much worse which exists on reddit. Claims for increases in transparency, while no actual increase in transparency, particularly towards those banned subs exists, or why subs deemed ""worse"" (looking at SRS specifically) are allowed to get away with much worse (either with respects to illegal content or brigading.)   By BS I mean incidents like firing Victoria without alerting mods of appropriate subs, causing issues when it came to AMA's for a day and lying about free speech. To quote ex CEO Yishan ""We stand for free speech. This means we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits. We will not ban legal content even if we find it odious or if we personally condemn it."""
boogie2988,3cw9ja,Xdeser2,4,Sat Jul 11 21:03:04 2015 UTC,"Like I said: FPH was banned because it engaged in harrassment, its been proven. Thats why they were banned, not because of Pao. I personally think that Coontown and subs like it should be outright banned, but hey, they arent banning based on opinion or subs they find distasteful, exactly what you said there.  Like I also said: Pao did not fire Victoria.  SRS is fucking nothing, it has 0 influence anymore. They do not brigade as much as reddit loves to say they do."

I think they even doxxed him and sent threats to his wife.   A couple weeks ago they were trying to say Boogie was a rape apologist because he mentions in a video 5 years ago that he watched the amazing atheist's channel one time. More recently he left these comments on the pro ethics in gaming journalism subreddit.   when he says hes scared shitless hes replying to someone who asked if he felt like he could only go on that sub with the excuse of being on vacation and having nothing else to do. Boogie said he feels like he cant go on that sub much because hes scared shitless the anti-gamer SJWs will start a crusade against him.   Thats why Boogie's content has been so SJW appealing lately. Like when he said people who wanted to play they game hatred were ""assholes"" or when he made that video defending the HAES supporter tess holiday.   Sure he also makes videos that are slightly anti-SJW as well. But thats all part of his attempt to try to appeal to both sides at once while contradicting his own beliefs out of fear."

That person had, what sounded like, an Eastern European accent (though, it may have been French, it's been a while) and either insulted boogie or reacted to boogie's taunts (boogie likes to mess with people after they kill him) with ""FUCK YOU! YOUR MOTHER IS DOG!"" Since then, boogie has taken to emulating that to troll people."

I don't have nearly as much to lose, and none of those problems(yet) but I have trouble sticking to my diet pretty often.

boogie2988,3biyml,atsu333,3,Tue Jun 30 00:59:24 2015 UTC,"He said he is just stopped talking about it, cuz every time he made a video and even mentioned his weight people lost their shit.

boogie2988,3biyml,scttydsntknw85,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:31:25 2015 UTC,As long as he is consistent that's all I care about. If he loses weight slowly that is understandable.
boogie2988,3biyml,cupOwater1995,2,Tue Jun 30 12:18:06 2015 UTC,"He is saying he doesn't want to eat now because of the medication they gave him at hospital, and he is losing weight because of it. That  is a short term band-aid fix though, I fear he will just put all the weight on again because he is eventually going to return to eating ""normally""  To answer your question he does try, just not hard enough."
boogie2988,3biyml,cupOwater1995,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:40:22 2015 UTC,honestly i dont think posts like these help. I for one honestly truly enjoy boogie's personality and his videos and would be hurt if i was to hear of him passing so YES i want him to get healthy but thats something he has been doing together with his doctor and family and its non of our business.

Been watching him for a while but I'm liking him less and less.  Seems like the more popular he gets the shittier his content gets.  It would be best tor his longevity to lose some serious weight quickly but I imagine he'll be fluctuating near the same weight until his death at a young age."

They are not a new company and this is not their first PC port.  Otherwise, great video!"
boogie2988,3b22eo,Primesghost,5,Thu Jun 25 14:21:15 2015 UTC,"Can you give us a source for the ""Steam keeps a cut of the sales even after refunds""?  Because if that's true it's hilarious, lel"
boogie2988,3b22eo,guru8bit,3,Thu Jun 25 12:27:40 2015 UTC,Well said. I am so glad we can finally hit them in their wallets. Thanks Steam!
boogie2988,3b22eo,Corusmaximus,2,Thu Jun 25 10:40:39 2015 UTC,"As much as everyone is excited about this being pulled, and I really hope it will make a difference in the future for developers to not rush their PC ports out the door, I can't help but feel bad for the developers of Arkham Knight that really put their all into this game.  I've been playing Arkham Knight for the past few days, and honestly it's a SUPER fun game. Like, I feel that a lot of the team that worked on this game really put a lot of creativity into this game, and in my 8 hours so far the game has still not lost my interest. I'm having way more fun with the Batmobile mechanics than I thought I would, and the scenes where Batman is tripping out from Scarecrow's toxins continue to pull stuff from left field; they make me feel uncertain and kinda freaked out, LIKE IT SHOULD, and that's no easy task in a video game where you know there's no threat. But they did it somehow! And so I think there are a lot of people that deserve credit for the soul put into this game.  It must be so upsetting for all the people that tried their best, for the only positive feedback they're getting so far to be ""we're glad it was pulled from Steam""."
boogie2988,3b22eo,Ashanmaril,2,Thu Jun 25 16:32:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, poor devs, they cut corners to get more money and outsourced the PC version to a company that had already fucked up one of their games, it's really not their fault.  If they had given a fuck in the first place this would've never happened. The Arkham games have always sold amazingly on PC, almost the same number of sales as on 360, and yet they treat the PC audience like we don't even exist.  I say fuck'em. Finally some payback."

boogie2988,3b22eo,KingDerekx,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:46:27 2015 UTC,"So, being a gaming industry nub I will pose this question: If people are able to get refunds more easily through steam now, does this mean pre-orders are less risky?   TL;DR: If you could get a full refund for a pre-order, why not pre-order (If and where applicable) You could test out the DLC and hopefully in that short time period where a refund is valid, decide whether or not you felt it was worth it. HAS VERY LIMITED KNOWLEDGE OF GAMING INDUSTRY OUTSIDE OF WHAT VARIOUS YOUTUBERS REPORT ON IT"
boogie2988,3b22eo,micmusicfan,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:29:27 2015 UTC,"Definitely.  I still don't like to buy games at launch, the ones I bought on day one are limited to Skyrim and GTAV so far, but if at this point you might as well pre order since it really doesn't cost you anything.  It's not like not preordering is stopping them from doing preorder bonuses, and even if everyone stopped preordering they would probably find an even worse way to sell you stuff."
boogie2988,3b22eo,guru8bit,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:23:48 2015 UTC,"With regards to that final statement, I suppose the message would be quite clear if a game developer started seeing an influx of pre sale returns OR, that happening and then the purchase of the regular non dlc laden game."

Boogie is pretty open with his followers and that is good. It's the a great way to improve his mental state. He paid the price for doing that. Lesson learned hopefully for a long time.   It's fine to be angry about it personally, but it really bugs me when people feel the need to blow it up in social media etc. I'm sure he gets enough for hatefull messages already. This celebrity culture is sickening."

I am mad because he said he is going to fight this with everything, but then does this.  This isn't something that happends once in a blue moon, because I could forgive that. Because people here are too forgiving of this behavior, I believe no matter how harsh I come across as, it is no where near damaging as accepting this all the time... and I have accepted this stuff for a loooong time, and so has anyone else who has been watching for years."

I am tearing you down man... to build you back up ( remember this )  You are mentally weak man, I have studied you long enough now to know this. You need to admit this to yourself and even more important your viewers, because only until you admit to them, that you have been mentally weak, can you really move past this.  I think you can do it man, I really do, I am not saying this to blow smoke up your ass too. We all fall before we rise, get beat down before we get up. If you are going to ever seriously going to beat this you need to become tougher, harder and sterner on yourself. No more it was 'ocd, depression, or anxiety' no more man.   When you stop saying those are the reasons you do these things is the time you really won't be shackled by them, and I firmly believe you leave this shit in the dust man, onto a better life.  Some doctor might have told you these things, and maybe they are true... but you know what? Why does that apply to you man? You are mother fucking Steven Williams, you can sit their all you want and say to yourself it's this and this reason, or you can just actually become so resolute where you do not fail, you cannot fail, because even if these ARE reasons to why you eat, you're going to be so fucking tough and strong no matter how tough it gets you're going to rise up, like you never have before.

Do you actually WANT to lose weight? Stop playing the victim card, man. You can lose the weight, it's a mental hurdle you have to overcome. If you constantly give in to eating shitty food, you'll never change.  Seriously, if you eat 2500-3000 calories a day, you'll lose weight. And that is a massive amount of food. You can do it, no doubt in my mind."

boogie2988,3b6k4l,commodorenorrington,4,Sun Jun 28 18:45:57 2015 UTC,"I agree with OP in some ways. Boogie doesn't appear to be doing absolutely everything he can to improve his health. When your life is on the line, there is no excuse to be eating fast food. I'm not personally upset by it, because it's his own business and not mine, and I watch his videos because I'm interested in his commentary. I'm just saying that anyone rushing to his defense has probably never sustained successful weight loss of more than a few pounds. He's a smart guy, and we all know his doctors have told him this a thousand times, so I don't think it's something that he should be upset or surprised by. I'm only saying, in his situation, it takes absolute dedication. OP is a bit harsh here, and I haven't lost faith in Boogie, but he could be doing more. I hope he gets well soon and along with it finds the dedication and support (I know how many people out there are behind him) to make the commitment and really change his life."

You really made me laugh at the end of a very serious video.  Get well soon Boogie. I discovered you years ago through one of your Francis videos being linked, and once I got over the shock and realised this wasn't a real person, and how eloquent, intelligent and well spoken the real man was I was really hooked. I was so happy that first time you were on the Co-Optional podcast, because you were clearly an admirer of the hosts, particularly TB, and it felt more like ""one of us"" fans had somehow made it onto the podcast and were speaking on behalf of the viewers directly to the hosts we love. (I still re-watch that episode like I would re-watch a favourite movie).  It was great to see how much attention you got during the console launches and your skit with Major Nelson. The happiness you had going to New York for the PS4 launch. Honestly it's like I live a second life through your perspective every time I watch your videos because none of it ever seems to go to your head.  Your wife sounds like your soul mate. What a trooper staying with you all that time. Much love to her as well.  Whether it's 50 pounds or 1 pound weight loss, I really hope it keeps going in the right direction for you. Know that thousands of viewers like me are rooting for you to win with your weight loss, but that nobody is holding you to account. We're your cheering section.  Get well soon man.

Probotics. fucking pound back probiotics. the antibiotics your on right now are basicly a slash and burn type deal. kill everything not human in your guts, and alot of what makes your body works is the flora in your guts. its not going to be a cure-all for antibiotic related problems, but its the difference between shitting for 2 hours and shitting for 5 hours. like, force yourself to eat a cup of Yogurt every so often. really helps. or take supplements.   also, afterwards for the best bounce back, prebiotics. prebiotics are nutrients that your body can't digest, but the flora in your gut can. eat things like asparagus, oatmeal, things like that. supplements for those are also available  get better boogie, we love you <3"

Hopefully this will strengthen your resolve to keep fighting your battles with food addiction and your health. Your wife is also an absolute star, and was kind enough to update us on Twitter. She didn't have to do that, but knew how much you mean to everyone.  Glad to see you're on the mend Boogie."

Your wife obviously sees how awesome you are and she loves you. I hope you know that you are valuable. To her, to your friends, to me, to your fans. You say you love us in every video. We love you too. We were scared with you and we are relived that you're getting well with you.  Your struggle with weight does not define you.  Your fight to overcome every bad thing in your life and leave a legacy of hope, kindness, and acceptance define you more to me than your weight ever will. I pray you overcome it. I know you will.

boogie2988,3b2c9k,I-HATE-FUPAS,10,Thu Jun 25 12:11:17 2015 UTC,This guy clearly didn't watch the reat of the video as the next statement is to say that it makes any illness you get lofe threatening.
boogie2988,3b2c9k,uberwolf0,7,Thu Jun 25 22:09:10 2015 UTC,I think when he said HAES he meant its true to a point. You can be over  weight and young and not have to worry about diabetes or other things but just wait until you hit 30 or 40. I think that's what he was trying to say.
boogie2988,3b2c9k,KerzenscheinShineOn,5,Thu Jun 25 12:39:55 2015 UTC,This should be higher.  OP took that line out of context and missed Boogie's point.
boogie2988,3b2c9k,Dazeuda,3,Thu Jun 25 17:05:36 2015 UTC,"Also he was mostly talking to obese people that were in the 300 and below range. I fall into this category. I don't have any problems moving around, or taking walks, exercising, or other physical stuff, while somebody around Boogie's size or bigger has issues with that. Also I might not have any health issues at the moment, however I am still at a much higher risk for medical problems than somebody within a healthy weight range. Diseases and infections can also be quite worse or even deadly if you are obese. This was a very honest and heart felt message to people like me who need to step up our weight loss game."
boogie2988,3b2c9k,rivfader84,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:07:54 2015 UTC,Yes I understood all that. But there's some people pushing 300lbs and rising cause its something they want to do or achieve and its gonna get them eventually.
boogie2988,3b2c9k,KerzenscheinShineOn,2,Fri Jun 26 02:41:31 2015 UTC,"Do you seriously think Boogie hasn't heard all of your arguments already? I thought that line about being healthy at any size was a little cringe-worthy too, but you come off as pretty arrogant in this post."

Yeah I guess I'm not a true fan then, no criticism allowed, even though Boogie heard of this a thousand times and yet nothing has changed. I'll see myself out.  And I'll leave you with this gem trending in /r/videos."
boogie2988,3b2c9k,Clob,-1,Thu Jun 25 12:37:35 2015 UTC,"arrogant   Yes arrogant because you don't know fucking shit all about health or anything about anatomy. It's not your fucking place to judge, or speak up. So shut the fuck up and stop being a part of the problem. Youre not being critical, you're being a selfish twat about shit that isn't your business or your problem.   Leave his problems to him and the professionals helping him.  Also, you missed the whole point of what he said anyways. He said that we can be healthy at any size until something goes wrong, and then we die.  Do you honestly think that he thinks that he is healthy, or someone his size is healthy? You're stupid and know nothing if you think that."

boogie2988,3b2c9k,rivfader84,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:41:54 2015 UTC,"It's a movement called ""Health at any size"" It's really dumb and they are trying to pretend that obese people like me are healthy as somebody in a normal weight range. This movement has done more harm than good. While I continue to do pretty good with my own weight loss, I have seen lots of people around my size or bigger give up and continue on with their bad habits because ""LOL I HAVE NOTHING WRONG WITH ME GIVE ME THE EXTRA CHEESEBURGER AND SLICE OF PIE!"" That is a huge failure on this movement's part. Instead of getting obese people more focused on losing weight and being healthy, now we got people outright not caring and giving up.  Another side effect is the movement has generated a lot of hate for fat people. We have all unfairly been lumped in with the fat pride parade, when that is just not true. A lot of us are losing weight, and taking in better health habits, and we are just as disgusted with the HAES movement and fat pride bullshit."
boogie2988,3b2c9k,TheGirthyMan,0,Thu Jun 25 23:18:49 2015 UTC,"most people in the normal weight ranges eat the same processed frankenfood that obese people eat, they just have better metabolisms.  i haven't ate a cheeseburger in over 4 months and haven't ate pie for probably two years and i'm still fat as shit and simply because i'm thick framed and genetically prone to storing fat i can never be considered anything less than overweight while eating a healthy diet"

They are not excuses. Depression is an actual chemical imbalance in the brain. It is not a mood, it is an illness, that furiously attacks your ability to see the world and your ability to enjoy anything. It's like a parasite that sucks all the fun out of everything and makes even simple tasks like getting out of bed or brushing your teeth to be obstacles that can look insurmountable.  Signed, a man that's had depression since he was 12"
boogie2988,3ai1hz,Netkeeper,-3,Mon Jun 22 11:16:51 2015 UTC,"Omigod depression isn't a chemical imbalance... this was assumed because the first antidepressants increased certain neurotransmitters so they figured it was physically caused by a lack of them.  That's like calling pain a codeine deficiency. I've had a lot of issues with depression in the past, all the way back through elementary school... I started exercising/running again about 6 months ago and I'm down 25 lbs and have a much better mood. Being around positive people helps too.  Mental Illness is an industry, not an affliction, and it's socially communicable and is exacerbated by corroboration. Take care of your body and mind and they will take care of you."
boogie2988,3ai1hz,soitvegins,3,Tue Jun 23 02:49:18 2015 UTC,"I've always known depression to be an imbalance. If it isn't, it's still a medical condition and not a mood -- it's a mild to severe problem that can seriously inhibit one's ability to do activities. It just isn't ""visible"" like a cut or broken arm is. It's just as valid an illness as anything else.  Mental illness isn't a fucking industry. Thanks for calling my numerous issues an ""industry"". If they were an industry, I'd have a much easier time finding treatment for some of the medical conditions I have. I keep throwing money at people but nothing's happening and I've had some of my mental conditions my entire life! So shut the fuck up."
boogie2988,3ai1hz,Netkeeper,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:23:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for calling my numerous issues an ""industry"".   You're welcome... thanks for supporting big pharma. Psychiatrists actually do need your support to pay their student loans off since they were dumb enough to specialize in pharmacological phrenology. These conditions are simply categories of dissatisfaction for the most part... what about the Asperger's patients who grew up under that diagnosis and then suddenly poof... their disease no longer exists and in many cases they literally have to choose whether they'd rather be considered normal or autistic?  Here's what terrifies me:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21459521  And this isn't new. The human brain is a homeostasis-seeking sentient organ and if we constantly barrage it's faculty that can make us feel less sad with chemicals that do so, it will fight back and eventually the changes it makes trying to compensate to reach its homeostasis may become permanent.   Lose the victim complex. Get laid. Lose weight. Take up exercise. Reduce cholesterol intake. Take vitamins. Focus on others and cultivate close relationships.   So shut the fuck up.   :/   I keep throwing money at people but nothing's happening and I've had some of my mental conditions my entire life!   Unfortunately it seems you're agreeing with me.... it's not working, and if you're lucky maybe that's because it's not the problem. I spent too much of my life waiting for pills to work and feeling broken when the human brain and body are wrought precisely to balance and heal themselves.   Hell, the UK even started prescribing exercise for depression. And if your issues are that numerous, you're probably partaking in the buffet of disease-mongerers, but that's nothing I didn't do either. But that said, I finally quit doing group therapy a long time ago after meeting too many borderline personality bipolar depressives with ADHD and PTSD who are obese from their antipsychotics originally only meant for schizophrenia but who really freaking need them and whose identities are constructed around being professional mental patients.  You're probably not as sick as you think and I hope you get traction to find your way to a peaceful life, whatever that takes."

Changing the diagnostic doesn't mean they don't have Asperger's any more, it means they are just on the autism spectrum now. It's just clarifying that Asperger's IS autism and there are lots of varying levels to it.   if we constantly barrage it's faculty   If we constantly barrage it is faculty  You love making assumptions, don't you? First, you're assuming I'm on antidepressants. I'm not, I'm just in therapy, because I'm also seeking treatment for a different condition first and that condition may be what's causing the depression.  You also assume a host of other things along with it. You assume I do not exercise. You assume I do not take vitamins. You assume I don't get laid. You assume I don't have close relationships. You assume so, so much. You don't know me at all, so don't act like you do.  You are, however, correct in that you can't just wait for pills to work. I've never been keen on antidepressants, I don't feel they will do me much good right now. But that doesn't mean they aren't a valid option for others. People can't expect an antidepressant to solve all their problems, it just makes them functional enough to solve it themselves. And that is very important."
boogie2988,3ai1hz,Netkeeper,2,Tue Jun 23 10:05:40 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you're not on antidepressants, that you exercise, and that you take vitamins. I hope you follow through with exactly what's working for you and that what's working for you takes you all the way out of the hell that can be depression. I have two cousins both of which were diagnosed with Asbergers... one of the two is clearly normal with an awkward phase growing up, the other of which was clearly suffering from autism but who has found her groove and who is going off to college this next year. Both of whom I'm proud of, the former of which I'm remorseful that he went through a pharmaceutical merri-go-round for nothing.  I still see the exact same therapist I saw when I was going through the exact worst of my shit... what's different is that we're out of shit to talk about problems-wise, so we swap jokes, talk about how much better we feel eating right, how much I'm going to miss her. I'm going out-of-state for college soon and that marks out end, so I'm continuing to see her until then since that's our logical endpoint and it's honestly still giving me comfort to see her.  I'm truly stoked that you're not taking antidepressants as those can be some of the worst for long-term outcomes and some of the hardest to come off of without problems. There will be a point in your future that you realize that your therapist isn't doing you good anymore and that you've ascended to a point where you don't need him or her, and I hasten that day.   P.S. Weed and/or alcohol can prolong depression... I didn't want to admit that for a while, but having been without for a long time I can confidently suggest cessation of both as another way to find your own sure-footing emotionally. Good luck to you man."

boogie2988,3ai1hz,zacfawstea,-3,Sun Jun 28 18:58:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah ive had depression aswell, and i found out that it was actually nothing but excuses, when i overcame my year long depression it was because i made life changes, i started forcing me up from bed doing stuff, running, trying to be social with some of my close friends that i neglected while my despression pulled me down.  Nothing helped until i changed myself.  Running and excersise likely saved my life back then..."
boogie2988,3ai1hz,BaconR4fitpeople,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:55:18 2015 UTC,"Depression is not an excuse.  You made life changes and that's what cured your depression and that's good. I've made life changes several times, and those did not work for me. Just because a cure worked for you does not mean it will work for everyone else, in the case of mental illness like depression. You can't just slap a band-aid on it and it will work every time for every person. Different treatments are for various people.  So again, it's not an excuse, it's an illness. Just like any other physical ailment. If someone broke their leg and you told them to run and they said they couldn't, would you call that an excuse? If someone got a concussion, would you tell them to just man up and get over it? Of course you wouldn't, and depression needs to be treated the same way."
boogie2988,3ai1hz,Netkeeper,0,Mon Jun 22 21:27:59 2015 UTC,"That wasnt my point... My point was to DO SOMETHING.  Being depression and avoiding your problems will only prolong your depression. Unless its based on a chemical imbalance... But still, go see your doctor then, dont hide and make UP EXCUSES because of a depression."
boogie2988,3ai1hz,BaconR4fitpeople,7,Mon Jun 22 21:32:44 2015 UTC,"Um, you have a SERIOUS misunderstanding of depression. Depression, the medical condition, which is what we're all talking about here, is a mental illness. It is a medical condition. It is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain. We are not talking about being sad. We are not talking about a mood.  So no, major depressive disorder is not an excuse. It's a real reason."

boogie2988,3ai1hz,BaconR4fitpeople,0,Tue Jun 23 15:39:28 2015 UTC,"If all you're seeing is weakness, then you don't actually know what depression is. And yes, it's possible to not know what depression is despite having had it. Out of curiosity, was your diagnosis mild, moderate, or severe?  You act like people with depression DECIDE to suffer, like they DECIDE not to ""get moving"" or ""be a winner"", and you could not be any more wrong. We didn't choose this shit. You think I would have chosen to have this? You think I would have chosen to have any of my illnesses and conditions? And you think I'm not working on it?  You're a stupid fuck."

When I was depressed the medication didn't do shit except make me suicidal so I got up and did something instead of moping. You just got to GET UP, or you can just continue to get more depressed. Sure simple things were hard but just because something is hard doesn't mean you can't do it. There's other ways to change the chemical imbalance besides taking bigpharmas pills."

boogie2988,3ai1hz,Corusmaximus,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:41:44 2015 UTC,"This comment is controversial, so I wanted to clarify what I was thinking. Boogie has said in a recent video that it is mostly a mental health issue. It seem to me to be like a drug addiction in that there are all kinds of mental health problems that are the real underlying issue with stopping the problem behavior (anxiety, depression, etc.). These are completely understandable reasons not to be able to break an addiction (to me anyway). Sometimes when you don't have the willpower to do something yourself you need help.  Like drug rehab, sometimes you need to be restricted from the temptation that is causing you problems. If I had Boogie's problem I would have someone with me most of the time to help me monitor my behavior and remind me of my goals when I needed it. I dont think it is fair to ask a spouse to do that, the emotional toll is pretty high.  Anyway, that is my two cents. Its not my journey and I dont have a clue what Boogie has to deal with, so I am the first to admit it comes from utter ignorance."
boogie2988,3ai1hz,Netkeeper,3,Mon Jun 22 13:57:52 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't object to this idea myself, but is that even possible, and if so, is it /affordable/?"
boogie2988,3ai1hz,Corusmaximus,2,Mon Jun 22 21:30:45 2015 UTC,"Probably not affordable, certainly not for me,  but maybe for Boogie. Not sure how much he is making.  But then the long term cost of his health issues ain't cheap either.  Maybe we could be creative and recruit grad students in nutrition sciences or clinical psychology or something and pay them way less than you would someone with a degree. They might be willing to do it for free if you are their dissertation research subject."
boogie2988,3ai1hz,Netkeeper,2,Mon Jun 22 21:46:01 2015 UTC,Now that's an idea. I like it.
boogie2988,3ai1hz,LynnSnow,2,Mon Jun 22 21:48:05 2015 UTC,That actually makes a lot of sense. Hell if he wants something good to put his donation money too that would be it.
boogie2988,3ai1hz,haggardwalrus,2,Mon Jun 22 14:56:24 2015 UTC,"Boogie, if you're reading this, I'm sorry that people don't understand mental health. I honestly think that a lot of people don't get that the ""pull yourself up by your bootstraps"" stuff doesn't work when that's all you've been doing to get through life this far. Every day with mental illness is pulling up by bootstraps. Every day is difficult, a challenge, and infinitely confusing and frustrating.  For everyone else, a great friend of mine dug up this nice little piece from the interwebs that shows a small slice of what it's like to live with mental/chronic illness or disability, and the frustration that comes with people who ""mean well"" causing disruption and constant negative feedback.  Everyone has different experiences with these things. What may have worked for you (hunkering down and forcing change?) doesn't work for everyone. The great part about humanity is that we're all different and have different experiences, so it's comes to reason that we will all deal with adversity in different ways.  I don't deal with weight issues all that much, but I do deal with depression, PTSD, anxiety, and several chronic health conditions stacked on top of each other, for which there is no medication or therapy. The best I can do is wake up every day and go to work. This is what this awesome guy is doing too. Just think about it next time you comment."
boogie2988,3ai1hz,Joey208,8,Tue Jun 23 04:38:09 2015 UTC,"For someone battling things, something like this is utterly unhelpful. Even if it is with good intentions. You don't just man up and snap out of depression or other mental problems."
boogie2988,3ai1hz,BaconR4fitpeople,5,Sat Jun 20 11:30:49 2015 UTC,Well then hes gonna die. Simple as that.
boogie2988,3ai1hz,haggardwalrus,3,Mon Jun 22 07:09:20 2015 UTC,"If he doesnt ""man up"" and get the help he needs plus a good deal of motivation and a Big reality check... Then he will die..   So go ahead and join the hug box and hope Boogie will slowly change over years and years of hurt feelings but he will most likely die many years before he fix his problems in a way you feel comfertable with."
boogie2988,3ai1hz,BaconR4fitpeople,4,Mon Jun 22 12:09:15 2015 UTC,"You think he doesn't know that? A person with depression or similar will read this and think ""why can't I man up, why can't I do this, look at these comments, I'm such a loser"" etc. A ""reality check"" or a harsh talking to is counterproductive."
boogie2988,3ai1hz,Lucretius_Black,-6,Mon Jun 22 12:32:57 2015 UTC,"I can only speak of experiance, and yes it works. Its so nice, easy and comfertable to say to yourself ""i do this in my own pace"" ""tomorrow im a new man"" ""my friends say that one day i will be fine, so i will""  You feel like hell all the time so when people give you even the smallest oppotunities to throw away reality and for a second feel normal you grap them and its the ONLY time you feel good about yourself, but its a fake form of happiness its artificial.  On the other hand... its borderline torture to be confronted with reality and your own very real and depressing situation. Because youre fully aware of how much crappy your life is, so you say to yourself you dont need people to remind you.  The thing is, when you go around not getting any real result and progress in your life, and you live day by day by these small gratifications from people around you patting your back... you go around day to day constantly pushing reality one more day into the future and suddenly 2 years went by and nothing changed.  Being confronted and getting smacked in the head with reality is horrible, but if you start to listen to reality instead of ignoring and playing a victim you will feel differences in your life almost instantly. Boogie is a fat piece of shit and the only way he will change that is to start taking mature and logical life changing decisions... We COULD be nicer to him, but then he should have changed years ago, he is litterally dying as a human... There is no time for niceness or else he will simply fade and break down biologically.  Stop being a victim!"
boogie2988,3ai1hz,BaconR4fitpeople,4,Mon Jun 22 12:44:22 2015 UTC,"I can also speak from experience and telling someone to snap out of it, referring to someone with a mental health issue or depression doesn't work always work. In fact, I would say that to think that it is a blanket solution (or even a solution for a majority or large minority)  is naive and on the whole a stupid thing to do.   So, stop being down right disrespectful and borderline cuntish and swallow a large gulp of reality. Your solution is not a blanket solution and although applying to some, it probably doesn't even come close to being a solution to the majority and CLEARLY isn't for Boogie considering he gets all this time and it's clearly not having a positive effect and in fact, is having an incredibly negative effect as he's said before.  Yes, Boogie will die if he loses weight and OF COURSE HE KNOWS THAT. Now, you say should ""start taking mature and logical life decisions"" and the decision we can both agree on is to lose weight. But here is were we disagree, Boogie shouldn't take that decision based on shit/hate said by someone over the internet telling him things that he already realises but doing so in a way that is only counter-productive whereas I believe that he should listen to those advising him on how to lose weight and also those who are in close proximity to him. The latter, I'm sure, address the issues that come with Boogie's weight but I'm also sure that his wife doesn't tell him to man up and lose the weight, ""you fat piece of shit"" because it's just a fucked up way to do it.    Also, there are plenty of shows that deal with the shock factor of the consequences of weight and will do incredibly nasty things to make them lose the weight. Difference between them and you? They've agreed to at least be involved in a process that they are aware will include shocks, meaning that they think that solution is for them. Oh and also, they then guide them through the process and actually treat them nicely on a personal level. They don't call them ""a fat piece of shit"" for example."
boogie2988,3ai1hz,Lucretius_Black,-2,Mon Jun 22 15:27:58 2015 UTC,"Well i would say its very naive to think that a discussion online would be in any way an indicator on how ""harsh"" or ""blunt"" i would personally tell someone in real life. My point was and is that many of his fans are enablers. And we are gradually becoming a culture of enablers, normalizing obesity.. We are on average more concerned with hurting ones feelings than we are about truth and reality, it doesnt help anyone.  Boogie is addicted to food.. Sure, food is a mental addiction.. But an addiction nonetheless, just not a physical one...  So without any knowledge about his family and personal life i would belive that he have also surrounded himself with enablers, not helping him in any way to not get access to the vast amounts of food he have to binge on every single day of his life to sustain his mass. Most fatties need tough love and a reality check... I agree that calling them fat fucks to their face is a less productive way to do it. But cutting through their bullshit, taking away their food and constantly reminding them what they are doing is a good beginning.  If youre Living with an alcoholic you shouldnt ""let it side"" if you see him/her opening a bottle of vodka. You wouldnt bring a cigerate to a lung cancer patience either."
boogie2988,3ai1hz,BaconR4fitpeople,3,Mon Jun 22 15:44:41 2015 UTC,"I wasn't using what you were saying as an indicator as to what would you would say in real life. Yes, I compared you (speaking online) and people he knows but I never specified that they had to be talking to him in real life. I'm sure that their behaviour, whether speaking to him face to face or telling him online would be similar.   I agree to an extent with the rest of the first paragraph in the sense that many are concerned about peoples feelings rather than truth and reality as truth and reality should always be the end goal. In my opinion, it's about how we get there.   Anyway, I'm not going to say much more because I do believe it's hard to say too much without knowing his personal life in depth and those he surrounds himself with. I mean, perfect example is that I claimed one thing about people he surrounds him with, you claimed another. We just don't know.   Anyway, I'm not an enabler at all. I think my point is just how we go about things rather than the end result. I mean, we both agree (fairly sure everyone does) that Boogie will die a premature death (Boogie knows this too) due to his weight and that the only way to prevent  this is quite drastic action in order for him to lose the weight."
boogie2988,3ai1hz,Lucretius_Black,-1,Mon Jun 22 15:55:59 2015 UTC,"It seems like we are mostly agreeing. Im just using more blunt language than you. I wouldnt call him a fat piece of shit to his face though if that helps, lol."
boogie2988,3ai1hz,BaconR4fitpeople,2,Mon Jun 22 15:58:53 2015 UTC,"I think we are mostly agreeing although I do think I disagree with a little more than just the language you used and slightly your thinking that the approach you outlined wouldn't necessarily work.

Just stop posting stuff about his weight or whatever. Instead, post ""oh man can you post a new Francis video on x?"" or,  ""boogie,  what do you think a out y?""

His family/friends can only get him so far, he has to do the rest on his own. Is this not evident enough when he says he eats food out of the TRASH sometimes then cries about it? This is not being resolute. It's just accepting that 'well I do this because I'm depressed, testosterone', or some other reason. Enough is enough and boogie needs to mentally toughen up, right now. Or accept that he is never going to be below the 500 mark. If he is this damn hurt by a post on the forums it's all the evidence I need to think he is definitely mentally fragile."

I don't know why, but for some reason Reddit moderators always end up fucking something.  Just sayin', the last thing this subreddit needs is starting to ban members and deleting messages, it's already almost empty and that is not going to bring more people over."

That other guy was insinuating boogie doesn't deserve what he gets because he thinks YouTube isn't a real job where he busts his ass.  He's basically calling boogie lazy.

No. But I don't think he was being an asshole, he expressed his points professionally and in a respectful way and I don't think his posts deserved to be removed.

Just because some goop has a bunch of stuff in it, doesn't mean it's in the correct form to allow absorption. You're also not taking into account  to what boogie may be deficient. Also, boggie may have too much of X and adding X may complicate things much worse. There is no one mix of macro and micronutrients that will suit everyone. The idea of Soylent is ridiculous and is a dramatic oversimplification of nutrition. Cell metabolism, the many of different metabolic pathways, hormonal and behavioral responses to diet, and many other things need to be considered at the very least before one gives advice on what he should do.   Another massive issue is that everyone seems to have ideas on how boogie can be helped, or what he needs, or what he should do. This needs to stop. Good intentions or not, it's disruptive and is almost never a good thing. There are just way to many things that people don't know about him and his condition. Boogie, last I recall, isn't asking everyone for input or for help. Lets not presume to give it."

With that said donations are better than e-begging (see TJ from The Amazing Atheist).  Queue the weird rationalizations from taking donations as if it's justifiable. In some cases it's pretty much like fraud as is the case with a lot of crowdfunding ventures.
boogie2988,3adood,9Blu,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:14:55 2015 UTC,"Being upset because people spend their earned money in a way that you don't agree with is a terribly skewed viewpoint. People don't think about the big picture every moment of their lives because the world is much too large for the individual to consider. We live our everyday lives on a micro-scale when it comes to humanity as a whole. We do our jobs, buy nice things, and take care of the people around us to a degree. Many people struggle with just that and some people wake up and may have to wonder if this is the day their world falls apart. That's also why people like donating and helping out to the community they are involved in. It can be running the soup kitchen or giving a streamer some extra money so he can keep doing what he'd doing. People likes seeing the immediate benefits of helping others and they don't get that when they give money to an organization, for the most part. That's also why you are trying to help out here. You may be talking about the large scale of things you are talking about it in a very micro sense.   Donating to Boogie is a penny in a fountain when you consider everyone in world thinks in this manner. Even if you did change the minds of everyone here and all the donation money from people of the subreddit went to a cause to help someone there will still be a plethora of people who won't because the issue here encompasses almost every human being out there."
boogie2988,3adood,commodorenorrington,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:52:40 2015 UTC,"""I am not being rude"" You don't get to decide this. Others do. Its like saying ""I'm not an asshole""  Also a large potion of people if given the opportunity would accept donations, Your self most likely included weather you admit to it or not. What people do with their money is their business. If they want to give it to someone they are entirely within their right to do so and should not be scrutinized about it.  Yes there are people who need it more than him, no it is not our responsibility to take care of them financially. Its a nice thing to do for sure, but there is no requirement to do so and choosing NOT to donate to a charity vs something else should not be an action someone is punished for.  So if all this is so important to you then start donating to the charities you think boogie2988 and his donators should be donating to and get off the hypocritical high horse of yours chief."

You are being entertained, something that people pay large corporations billions a year for.  Nope. Not a charity case at all.   ""Tip"" would be a better term to use. It's no different than dropping a $5 in the case of a street musician while you are enjoying their performance.  In both cases they are using their talents providing entertainment and you, the person being entertained, can pay what you think it is worth."

I know Boogie has said in the past that he blows things like this out of proportion, so I think these may be one of those times. For example, I remember he said a few weeks ago that his fat hatred video was received negatively when it was sitting at 95% likes."

He gets a lot of negatives comments on youtube and twitter. Maybe 95% of the people who watch him do agree and enjoy him, but when 800k people view a video, 5% of that is still 40k people. And if even 1% of that 40k actually air their grievances through twitter, facebook, etc,  that's still 4 thousand negative comments he would receive. That may be an insignificant number compared to the total number, but imagine reading 4 thousand negative comments about yourself, heck even 400 would be a lot."

Exclusives have been a part of video gaming going back to the Atari VCS. I think you can make the argument that exclusives are bad on one hand, while still being excited that a new game is coming out on the other, even if it is exclusive. I mean pretty much every Nintendo title is exclusive and no one gives them crap about it.   So I don't see it as hypocrisy. The two feelings can live together and you don't have to rehash the exclusive argument and not be happy about new games coming out. Just my take on it."
boogie2988,3aa8uw,ailyara,9,Thu Jun 18 15:49:04 2015 UTC,"One of the reasons I've backed off about being mad about console exclusives comes from something that major nelson told me last year during the game awards.  I complained to his face about tomb raider exclusivity and he said that were microsoft not willing to cut a deal with square/enix that chances are this tomb raider would not have gotten made.  I thought he made a great point.  later that next day I complained to Adam Boyes about SF5 exclusivity and adam said ""boogie, i'm not in the business of keeping others from playing games.  I'm in the business of creating games.""  He too explained to me that were it not for their involvement capcom would likely have NOT gone ahead on street fighter 5.  ""Playstation needed more fighting games, capcom needed help making their fighting game."" I believe is what he said.  Doing research on this topic with other people in the industry painted a pretty grim picture.  Exclusives don't exist as much as to sell consoles as they exist to convince console companies to invest in your game.  Timed exclusive, gamestop preorders, preorder bonuses, all of this shit... its all part of cost cutting measures that will allow these games to exist in an era where budgets are soaring.  That said, i DID give sony shit about their policies involving exclusivity (and gave no shit to microsoft) in the playstation video.  watch that here: https://youtu.be/gHNi7HFgPPk?t=6m18s  Please note, at the request of a LOT of fans, I wanted this year's e3 to be all about positivty.  I wanted to be a positive force in gaming this year, knowing full well there's plenty of negative ones out there these days.  I wanted to cheerlead these two companies as they did good things.  BUT I STILL TOOK THE TIME TO REMIND SONY HOW MUCH I HATE THEIR BONER FOR EXCLUSIVITY.    IDK what else you want me to do.  I too own both consoles.  I too pc game.  I too support all 3 platforms to the best of my ability.  I'm trying my best do it through positivity instead of negativity these days and i'm sorry if I wasn't negative enough."

boogie2988,3a4igz,chriskicks,11,Wed Jun 17 04:09:48 2015 UTC,"I dont see what everyone was expecting Nintendo to announce. You guys already knew there wouldnt be any Zelda U and all the other shit has already been announced. They shows some star fox gameplay, which although the graphics looked like gamecube, what more do you want? A new metroid would have been cool I guess but I'm assuming their saving all of that for their new console in 2017"
boogie2988,3a4igz,HaberdasherA,2,Wed Jun 17 04:57:01 2015 UTC,"the issue was they recognise all the franchises we love. we love mario, animal crossing, zelda, metroid.... then they show off ALL of those franchises with half-assed mini co-op games. who the hell wants an animal crossing board game in wii u? who wants a metroid with no samus and some lego ninjago soccer?   it just failed to deliver and missed the mark on what nintendo fans want completely. thats more of the reason why i was upset. personally, im starting to think they want to kill the wiiu and focus completely on this NX thing next year."
boogie2988,3a4igz,HaberdasherA,4,Wed Jun 17 05:02:40 2015 UTC,they are killing off the wii u because its lifespan has basically ran out. Best thing they can do is release a new console with normal controllers and hardware good enough to compete with the other consoles ASAP. If we're lucky it will be backwards compatible so people who just bought a wii u wont be fucked.
boogie2988,3a4igz,guru8bit,2,Wed Jun 17 05:06:38 2015 UTC,"Nintendo uses older hardware because they don't need it for their games and because basically it's the best way for them to stay afloat.  If they actually invested on the most powerful hardware out there, and that console didn't sell because it had to compete with the PS4 sales, they would go bankrupt really quickly.  So don't expect a powerful console from Nintendo, that's just not the way they work."
boogie2988,3a4igz,t0pgearl4mbo,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:44:55 2015 UTC,If nintendo would use more powerful hardware then they could actually get 3rd party support. As as no 3rd parties want to be on the Wii-U because the performance is so inferior to other systems. With proper 3rd party nintendo could actually compete with PS and Xbox instead of being relegated to a secondary console.
boogie2988,3a4igz,guru8bit,2,Wed Jun 17 14:22:09 2015 UTC,"The PS4 and Xbone are literally the same thing, and third party on those consoles has been pretty fucking terrible so far. Your posts begs the question ""why do we need yet another identical console?""  All multiplats are better on PC, that's a fact. You don't buy a console to play a multiplat. Nintendo is fine as it is, I'd rather have a console that actually has exclusives rather than another gimped pc-like console that still has bad performance despite the new hardware."
boogie2988,3a4igz,t0pgearl4mbo,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:29:25 2015 UTC,"I own all of the consoles including the Wii-U as well as a PC. But I am the exception not the rule. Most people want to buy one console, not 2 or 3 so having a good selection of multi-platform games is important. Having only nintendo games on a nintendo console isn't a viable option if nintendo wants their console to hit big numbers they need both 3rd and first party. Is there a reason Nintendo can't make a powerful console and also have good first party games?"
boogie2988,3a4igz,guru8bit,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:52:49 2015 UTC,"The reason is exactly the one I wrote, they just don't work that way. They make their profit from using older hardware, they would never make something powerful, mostly because they don't need it. And your point about WiiU not being able to handle multiplats because it's not powerful, come on, what does that even mean? If the people that make multiplats can port them on the PC and give people the opportunity to change settings, they can clearly lower them a bit for a less powerful console, that's not why they don't port games to the WiiU."
boogie2988,3a4igz,t0pgearl4mbo,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:06:42 2015 UTC,"But they're not making money off the Wii U because they can't move units. That's kind of my whole point. The Wii-U isn't just less powerful than the PS4 or Xbox One, it's significantly less powerful. Closer to a 360 or PS3 - and that's not enough for developers to port their ""next gen"" games to the Wii-U.  I'm not trying to come across as aggressive in my comments. I love my Wii-U and I want Nintendo to succeed, but in order for them to compete with the other consoles they need more power. A powerful console, plus real online features, plus 3rd party, plus their own fantastic first party titles would make for an unstoppable console. People want to play Nintendo games, they just don't want to pay for a console that can only play Nintendo games.  They have gone from selling 100 million units with the Wii to less than 10 million with the Wii-U. Obviously the strategy their using isn't working. Luckily they still have the 3DS bringing in buckets of cash."
boogie2988,3a4igz,guru8bit,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:02:02 2015 UTC,"Somehow 10 million isn't good? If you compare any sales to the ones the Wii had everything is going to be selling like crap, there is absolutely no way to replicate the sales the Wii had, and it's pointless to try.  And no, having better hardware doesn't bring more ports, again, developers can just lower the settings of the game and run it on whatever they want. Not to mention we've been starting just now to see multiplats going to just the newest consoles, and even if the WiiU was as powerful as a ps3, none of the ports the ps3 got went to WiiU. Power is not the reason why people don't port to WiiU.  Not to mention what you said you want already happened. The ps2 sold amazing, one of the best selling consoles ever, then Sony made the ps3, which had the best hardware of its generation, and the ps3 got destroyed by the 360 in sales.  Again, hardware doesn't mean more ports or better games."
boogie2988,3a4igz,Squidgyness,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:00:51 2015 UTC,"I think it was the greatness of the other conferences cough fallout4 cough that put Nintendo in the shade. Even though I don't follow much Nintendo stuff since their Wii U days, it still sucks for the owners. Especially since they made this big push recently to sell more of that console and then have not released much of any info on games for it at this E3 from what I saw.  Some people were expecting a new Mario title (rightly or not), Metroid, I saw calls for some new Pokémon side games, people wanted more retro stuff too. Not saying they were right to want all this stuff, but that's what I saw.  They have some okay momentum finally but they are going to let it slowly die out unless they keep some games coming. If they basically cut losses and only do a few games every few months, owners of the Wii U are going to be severely cheesed off. I know I would be!"

boogie2988,3a4igz,guru8bit,2,Thu Jun 18 09:15:39 2015 UTC,"Mostly disappointed about the 3DS, one port, stuff no one cares about, and a terrible looking metroid.  A new 2D or 2.5D metroid would've been perfect for the 3DS, instead we get another FPS metroid (which was already terrible to play on a GC controller or Wiimote) with the shitty controls the 3DS has, good lucking playing that without the N3DS. And it's not even a mainline Metroid, just a spinoff.  The only good thing from the conference was the co-op Zelda, and even that one was probably effortless to make since they're just recycling the engine from A link between worlds and adding multiplayer. Not saying I'm not interested, but multiplayer Zeldas have always fallen short, and I don't see why this should change that.  Really meh, glad about that Pokemon looking thing finally getting to the west, but that's it."

Forget all the side series from the companies they own and their new ips    ""It's all just mario""    And even then, that doesn't change the fact that the other guy is far from the only one that was pleased with the e3 nintendo news"
boogie2988,3a4igz,Rozekail,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:08:56 2015 UTC,"You can call me an idiot, and disagree with what I said, but that doesn't change the fact that Nintendo IS getting really lazy and just making what are essentially copies of the same games over and over. There are a handful of third-party titles, and one or two new IPs. And none of them last, because fucking Nintendo fanboys buy the shit out of every Smash Bros, Mario Party, Mario Kart, Mario World, etc. Yeah, that might be great for you, but for people that like variety, the Wii U isn't the way to go. That's a fact."

In all seriousness, anyone who paid a little bit of attention to Nintendo and their news in the last couple months knew there wasn't gonna be anything immense shown off. they said they were only gonna focus their E3 on games coming in 2015 and early 2016. So for the most part of it, the games they brought were either games we already knew about (Xenoblade, Wooly World, etc...) and smaller games/spin offs.    Metroid fanbase is also crying because they are making a metroid spin off involving federation troopers.  (While ignoring the fact the revival of the 'prime' subtitle is more then likely in order to hold people over for an eventual 'true' metroid sequel, which they already implied they also have people working on (both a 3D and 2D version)    In general : people got their hopes up without rhyme or reason> hopes obviously weren't met (as anyone paying attention could have said beforehand) > Nintendo is literally Hitler"

It felt like Xbox knew they had to try really really hard and answer the call. To me PlayStation got called out by free backwards compatibility, and being more relaxed about E3 made they seem worse off because of it. However the PlayStation conference was not bad by any stretch of the imagination, and the games announced I am definitely excited for, I just think Microsoft took that extra step that made them seem better overall."

And judging by how loved Fallout 3 was, there is nothing wrong with setting your hopes high :P  No harm in getting excited about an upcoming release.

Everyone should be obese! ""    Of course not.   Nobody things that. That makes no sense, and I don't get why such a crazy idea could justify the existence of hate groups.  In other words, what is called ""health"" is comprised of many variables, not all necessarily under the person's control.    The number on the scale is only one of many ways your doctor can assess your health and fitness.   Skinny is not exactly equal to healthy. Weight loss can be done in unhealthy ways.   One of the kids I grew up with died from bulimia.  Eating disorders are the #1 most deadly psych diagnosis.  And no matter how unhealthy you think you getting fat is, it's not OK to use abuse,  harassment, doxxing, and threats."

Ultimately I didn't like fatpeoplehate, because they were not constructive, you can hate that fat people are fat, you can hate fat, but if you hate fat people odds are, you won't be encouraging anyone to live a better life, a friend of yours who hates you being fat but loves you is going to encourage a healthy weightloss far more than someone who hates you for being fat.

The fact that you put zero effort into finding that out shows ignorance that could have easily been avoided with minimal effort and that's saddening to me. All you had to do was read the sidebar, click a link, and look.   However, I really hate fat people that think being fat is healthy...   Why do you hate anyone? If you have to hate, don't you think that hating murderers, rapists, child and animal abusers, etc. would be a more valid output for hate than fat people who do nothing to you except have a myopic viewpoint? Sure, thinking that being overweight is a healthy lifestyle is stupid, but to ""really hate"" anyone who thinks that way is ridiculous, especially since it does next to nothing to you.   I think reddit has done the wrong thing by censoring subs like this   Reddit is a platform. While you may disagree with the policies of a platform, in no way do you have the right to use someone else's platform to express yourself. Reddit has the right to ban or censor anyone for any reason they see fit. I don't necessarily agree with what they've chosen to do, but reddit gives you a platform. I don't believe it is censorship if you own the platform. If any government agency comes along and says that you can't say that under the threat of legal action or physically removes that content, that is a violation of your right to free speech. Even Boogie doesn't agree with reddit's decision, but it's not his, or your platform, it's reddit's  EDIT: A fuck up"

After that, the best way to get people here, would be saying to post on reddit or visit here at the end of every video, as far as I'm aware, boogie advertises the subreddit just on a few videos. Last thing, involve the community more, ask opinions about recent news, make people want to post what they think. About either video games or just other stuff.

I want to comment on the part where you state you don't understand the hate some people have towards certain groups of people. I'll use the example of fatpeoplehate because that's the main topic in this video too.  Some people don't hate because they like to hate, just like most people don't choose to be fat. A lot of people don't understand how it is possible to be fat. Just eat less and it should be fine, right? As you said in one of your previous videos the excessive eating is the consequence of an underlying problem. In the same way I think it is possible to hate on people, because there are underlying issues. They just can't stop hating because they need it to survive in the real world.  An obviuos example here could be someone who is really insecure (possibly because he/she got bullied when he/she was young). By hating on groups of people (and getting comfirmation by other people who also hate on them) they get more confident, because they think they are better than that particular group of people.  I am in no way trying to justify hate, but I think there could be some similarities between being  fat and hating on people. The big difference is the unvoluntary second party when you hate on people, which makes hating considerably worse.  I would like to know how Boogie (and other people) think about this point of view, and possibly start some kind of meaningfull conversation.

My sister has been overweight for a great part of her life, and I saw how difficult it was for her to loose the fat, and how she struggles to keep her condition as it is.  What I was trying to say is that it can be equally hard for people who hate to stop hating as it is for fat people to stop eating. It isn't ""just don't eat/hate"", it's way more than that. People use hate/food to make life easier on them.  Your last sentence is exactly what I meant. If they feel they ""fit in"" they are happier (because that's all they ever wanted), and thus life becomes easier for them."
boogie2988,39kdmu,MrCactusNeedle,0,Fri Jun 12 12:14:09 2015 UTC,"I am in no way trying to justify hate   (Off-Topic incoming) I like this statement because it reminds me of a cabaret artist who explains terrorism. His show in 2004, where he explained why they attacked America, without justifying it. It's really interesting. Here is the part and its recommended to everyone to watch it fully: https://youtu.be/sg9bQDqKJnU?t=30m9s Its a bit focussed to Germans obviously, but its interesting to everyone, it has subtitles and some things apply still today.    PS: English isn't my first language, so there might be a few errors in the text...   same here ;)   I wanted to share a story myself as well here. One friend of mine is a very explosive and loud character. And in the anonymity online things like this just tend to go extreme. And I think it's not really his fault, that negative things influence him so much. And I don't think it's healthy to rage too often, so I can definitely understand your comparison to ""being fat"". I guess he just has to ""let it out"" in one way or another.  Quite recently he told me he hates it when fat people don't do anything about it. And as an example he stated that there is a guy at work who drinks energy drinks all the time and only uses the elevator instead of stairs and the car for every little trip he does. I can somewhat understand it and I told him a bit of boogies story and he didn't say anything negative about it.  I don't know what the point of this is, I guess I just wanted to share it."

Did you not say something in a previous video that you are 50 lbs from your heaviest ever? Maybe I misheard that point, but it seems as though things have not been getting better, and it makes me sad! You said that you talk about it because it makes you think about it and act on it, but have you? I'd love to support you in any way I can, but it's getting hard for me to watch any sort of fat/health related video of yours because 1) because I'm not particularly interested in them anymore (not really making progress + the video where you sort of defended Tess what's her face) and 2) because they are taking away from gaming related content I feel.

It's kind of nice knowing he trusts his fan base that much and if he finds benefit in venting or just getting all this info off his chest, more power to him. I also like it because we always give him support and motivation in the comments, so hopefully they really do make him feel better and give him a drive to keep going, because I really do mean what I say when I comment supportive stuff."

I guess we can't do much in this area as his audience, it's frustrating but he became this way for very dark reasons and they are harder to address than just cutting calories, although it could seem that way from the outside."

Because fat people take up part of a seat that I paid for on the bus and on the plane. Because fat is intrinsically disturbing to look at. It's unattractive to 99% of the population, especially when it's spilling over your waistband and your shirt doesn't cover it. Because the majority of fat people are lazy in every other aspect of their lives, their living spaces and work spaces are filled with trash, they let their children and pets get fat. Because the one time in my entire life that I have ever thought about using a scooter at walmart (had a broken leg) they were all being used by fat people. Because they use their weight as an excuse to get disability checks. Because being fat causes tons of medical problems and then we have to hear fat people complain about it on top of tax money paying for it. Because fat people are such a hassle to be around that their own family can't enjoy spending time with them, they can't walk down the street, they can't go one hour without eating. Because fat cops, firemen, and military jeopardize other's lives. Because fat people are too lazy to do anything about their weight, despite tons and tons of positive support from family and friends. Because I don't want to go to my best friend's funeral before he turns 40.  I could go on, but the main point is this: being fat affects other people. I don't care how much you think it doesn't. It does whether you notice it or not. People are simply too polite to say anything. After a while, we are tired of trying to help others lose weight. We are tired of being nice to people who won't lift a finger to help themselves. We are tired of listening to fat people complain about a problem that they can fix all by themselves. So, we give up. You win. You are fat and you won't change. We tried and we can't help you, so the only option left is to hate you. Ignoring your fat isn't possible. It continues to affects us. Being surrounded by fat all day, hate gives us some catharsis from all the collective offenses fat people are to us."
boogie2988,39kdmu,me_and_batman,6,Sat Jun 13 02:52:35 2015 UTC,"Honestly to me it seems like you're just looking for a reason to be upset at someone. I have trouble believing you're really ""surrounded by fat all day"" and it's really affecting you directly in such an extreme way.  You're also positioning it as an ""us vs them"" which isn't very realistic. Unless you mean the minority of people who are bothered to the extreme by obesity.  Clearly the obesity epidemic is a huge problem and getting worse every year but hatred doesn't help anything. I feel like you do have some valid points especially about obesity and disability but it's an intertwined problem. No one wants to be obese to the point they can't leave the house. There's a mental aspect that has to be addressed before the physical stuff changes. It's the same as any addiction or disorder; modern medical science proves how addiction rewires the brain in a way that is extremely difficult to overcome without professional help and a support system. It's not just a simple matter of willpower. Food disorders get more complex because unlike drugs/alcohol you can't simply quit eating entire.  Compassion coupled with professional mental healthcare is the right answer. Imagine getting stuck in a spiral where you hate yourself, your life and you've trained your brain the way to deal with negative emotion is eating (however it started). The more hate you get from external and internal forces, the more depression you feel, the harder it is to change your habits.  I feel like the obesity disorder is also part of the mental health crisis in America - but instead of just locking up obese people like we do with other more extreme mental illnesses we socially shun them. They never got the help to rewire their brains to break the addiction.  Another part of the problem is the American food system is actually designed to make people fatter. Simple marketing. Create highly addicting food[1], increase portion sizes[2] - the person gets fat eating their favorite foods, so they can eat more of it, which increases the amount they spend on said favorite foods.

We are done putting the effort into helping people who won't help themselves.   I feel like the obesity disorder is also part of the mental health crisis   The ones suffering from a legit mental disorder are the minority, and we can't make them go to therapy. The rest?   food system is actually designed to make people fatter   So stop eating that shit, stop making excuses and blaming everyone else. No one forces fat people to eat junk food. It's not the government's fault, it's not corporations' fault, it's no one's fault but the person who is fat. Portion sizes? Get a to go box. Stop ordering the combo."
boogie2988,39kdmu,me_and_batman,6,Fri Jun 12 20:20:09 2015 UTC,"While you're right in that it's ultimately up to the person to control what they eat, you're wrong in arguing that it is entirely the person's fault for being fat 100% of the time. It's -mostly- their decisions that cause it, but you simply can't throw out external factors. And I'm not even talking about the exceedingly rare genetic disorders that cause excessive fat.  Look at the prevalence of high fructose corn syrup in food in America. HFCS is stupidly addictive and companies know this. It's used in such high quantities that, yes, it's very easy to become addicted to junk food/fast food. Of course there's other sugars too which are almost as prevalent and addictive. Shopping for actually healthy food is becoming more difficult every year for people who KNOW how to eat healthy, so obviously it's going to be a LOT harder for the people that don't know.   To use myself as an example, up until I was 10 or so I thought obvious junk foods like spaghetti and pizza was healthy. My parents, both overweight themselves, never put much focus on teaching what is good and what isn't. Instead they focused on quick/cheap meals and a ""no leaving the table until you finish your plate"" mindset which, naturally, did some damage. I'm still learning how to eat healthy, 16 years later. I'm managing it, but it's not easy in any sense. There's always that ""eh fuck it, I'll get a burger and fries"" mentality, which unfortunately I expect to haunt me for a very long time.  Ultimately there is nobody on this planet that will hear ""eat less you fuckin' fatty"" and respond with ""oh okay, thanks for the advice!"" Nobody's helping anyone by being an obnoxious dickhole and mocking them. If you think your only option is to hate them, that's your prerogative. But don't pretend like you're doing anything positive in the world by doing so. You're only hurting others, much like you claim fat people are hurting you."
boogie2988,39knui,Cyrus9586,2,Fri Jun 12 11:50:13 2015 UTC,Boogie is the most inspiring person I know of. His videos are like no other. He inspires me to be a better person. Keep doing what you do boogie!!

boogie2988,39jc5m,cybridlines,20,Fri Jun 12 03:10:24 2015 UTC,thank you.  I do my best.  now try being nicer to people if you can <3
boogie2988,39jc5m,uberwolf0,7,Fri Jun 12 07:16:21 2015 UTC,"Hello, also a user of /r/fatpeoplehate, and a huge fan of you. I just wanna say that I personally don't hate the people behind the fat, I hate the fat itself (unless someone supports HAES). Really sorry of all the trouble the subreddit put you through Q~Q. I have a ton of respect for you, and I wish you weren't fat. But some people just cant help it, and I 100% get it (someone in my family has some issues and cant lose the weight, really sucks that such a nice person has to go through that)."
boogie2988,39jc5m,MrStateTheObviouss,-3,Fri Jun 12 10:33:05 2015 UTC,Why would you say you don't hate fat people but do hate people who seek health (haes)?   Isn't poor health a top reason why the fatty haters justify their public hatred of anyone fat?
boogie2988,39jc5m,funchy,4,Fri Jun 12 12:16:41 2015 UTC,"people who seek health? HAES is healthy at every size. Instead of trying to lose their weight and be healthy, these people are trying to say that they ARE healthy even when they are fat."
boogie2988,39jc5m,MrStateTheObviouss,-2,Fri Jun 12 12:18:54 2015 UTC,"I hate the HAES movement as much as any other logical person with a functioning brain, but surely you have to admit that trying to shame them into a lifestyle change wasn't proactive. Those types of people look for reasons to become a martyr, and FPH was giving it to them. Sure, FPH might have started as an outlet for people to vent their frustration with the fat acceptance movement, but it's clear to anyone that they degraded into much, much worse at the end."
boogie2988,39jc5m,TheBanjoNerd,2,Fri Jun 12 12:34:02 2015 UTC,"That's a really nice sentiment, but you do realize that had you voiced this same opinion in FPH you'd have been berated and summarily banned, right?"
boogie2988,39jc5m,TheBanjoNerd,2,Fri Jun 12 12:31:12 2015 UTC,but this isn't FPH ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
boogie2988,39detc,JamiroFan2000,72,Thu Jun 11 00:40:55 2015 UTC,This helps explain what got banned.
boogie2988,39detc,kingluke663,71,Thu Jun 11 00:50:54 2015 UTC,"""There are no reports about coontown""  Yeah sure,"
boogie2988,39detc,CoCoNO,51,Thu Jun 11 00:56:09 2015 UTC,"Coontown was created by the refugees of various racist subreddits that got banned awhile ago (like /r/niggers) They've been very careful about making sure people don't witchhunt, dox, brigade or harass others because they don't want another ban.   /r/fatpeoplehate just got too big, careless and hateful for their own good and broke the rules."
boogie2988,39detc,dont_stop_smee_now,56,Thu Jun 11 03:08:19 2015 UTC,Explain how ShitRedditSays hasn't been banned after YEARS of complaints about harassment.
boogie2988,39detc,Dank_Sparknugz,5,Thu Jun 11 03:38:16 2015 UTC,"In case you guys were wondering, this is what they are talking about when the say ""brigading in the past"".  The still do shit like this, but they're more subtle about it since the admins are banning these subs for them under the guise of stopping harassment.  Basically, for the admins to do what SRS wanted them to do in the first place, SRS has to stop appearing to do it themselves, to give the admins free reign to only ban the subs they want.  But make no mistake, SRS has a much longer and more frequent history of harassment than any of the subs banned.  Then again, so do a lot of subs.  The admins have a very broad definition of harassment and a very ill-defined goal (make reddit ""safe""), and when you define your terms like that, applying your rules selectively is inevitable."
boogie2988,39detc,violatedchimp,1 point,Thu Jun 11 09:45:58 2015 UTC,Well I remember there being some controversy a few years ago about their supposed ties to a admin(s)  Or they're not the scary boogyman most redditors think they are ?  Occam's razor man
boogie2988,39detc,dont_stop_smee_now,21,Thu Jun 11 03:40:37 2015 UTC,They constantly brigade.  And that's what FPH was banned for.
boogie2988,39detc,Dank_Sparknugz,0,Thu Jun 11 03:43:49 2015 UTC,"No, FPH was banned for harassment. Not brigading. Brigading sucks, but vote manipulation isn't the same thing as harassment of individuals in ""real life"". That's what FPH was banned for. Not vote brigading."
boogie2988,39detc,WyMANderly,0,Tue Jun 16 12:09:46 2015 UTC,"No, FPH was banned for harassment.   This is not a correct statement."
boogie2988,39detc,Dank_Sparknugz,-17,Tue Jun 16 12:10:42 2015 UTC,Proof? Look man this is approaching /r/conspiracy levels of crazy.
boogie2988,39detc,dont_stop_smee_now,18,Thu Jun 11 04:25:20 2015 UTC,What proof do you need? Just go to the subreddit and take a look at it. All of the posts are links to comments.
boogie2988,39detc,POW_HAHA,0,Thu Jun 11 05:30:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, some subs only allow screenshots with names blurred (like FatPeopleHate), other allow np (no participation) links, and some just allow links."
boogie2988,39detc,GenericUsername16,9,Thu Jun 11 08:19:03 2015 UTC,"Allowing straight links to other things on Reddit, especially with a community like that, is pretty much promoting brigading. You can't deny that they do it, a lot."
boogie2988,39detc,Silverhand7,-12,Thu Jun 11 08:41:18 2015 UTC,FPH was much more apparent and simply unbearable.  SRS just feels like an extension of reddit.
boogie2988,39detc,xxfay6,9,Thu Jun 11 03:50:14 2015 UTC,"You're making the argument that because you don't like something it should be banned.  You know you can hide subreddits, right?"
boogie2988,39detc,Dank_Sparknugz,-7,Thu Jun 11 03:51:47 2015 UTC,"Nope, I'm saying SRS brigading doesn't have as much effect as FPH brigading, since SRS motives aren't dedicated towards harassment (it's just a cultural thing there) unlike FPH which was dedicated to harass and brigade to do so."
boogie2988,39detc,xxfay6,3,Thu Jun 11 03:59:40 2015 UTC,I don't understand the distinction.
boogie2988,39detc,GenericUsername16,-4,Thu Jun 11 08:17:07 2015 UTC,"This will be posted on a throwaway for obvious reasons.  Complaining about Reddit's censorship isn't enough. If you really want change, you have to affect the cash flow. Here's how!   Install AdBlock Plus, Ghostery, and/or AdGuard and turn them on for all reddit sites. Sign this Petition to have Ellen Pao, CEO of Reddit resign. Stop buying Reddit Gold. From now on until these bans have been lifted, support content with your upvotes, no more gilding.

boogie2988,39detc,seanbeag,2,Thu Jun 11 09:54:58 2015 UTC,"Other than point 2, this plan would basically destroy reddit and make everything shittier as it burned to the ground.  If you really wanna hate fatties so badly, why not just go to another website? I'm sure 4chan has plenty of room for you."
boogie2988,39detc,thudly,-4,Thu Jun 11 19:56:08 2015 UTC,"I think there's a difference.  The difference is that SRS is defensive in nature, and to ideas and opinions, while all of these others are offensive to actual people."
boogie2988,39detc,ok_ill_shut_up,3,Thu Jun 11 09:15:07 2015 UTC,"I'd like Reddit to release some statistics, that show what subs are briganding and the like, and make it clear that/if they have clear objective criteria for banning subs.  If bans are going to be based on hate or offensiveness, then /r/coontown, /r/cutefemale corpses and the rest need to be banned as well.  If bans are going to be based on briganding or intrusion into other subs, then we need to see the statistics showing that the subs which brigand the most, whatever they are, are banned. That subs which don't brigand as much are not banned while even bigger briganders remain.  They would face a lot less criticism is people could see the strict criteria that were being followed.   Otherwise, it seems like some subs that get too big and thus attract too much criticism get banned, while arguably worse subs stay. That it's PR not principle."
boogie2988,39detc,GenericUsername16,3,Thu Jun 11 08:14:20 2015 UTC,"As i see it 'individual' is the keyword. Having a subreddit that hates a group of people is ok, as long as its a group and not harrassing an individual. Which they did on fatpeoplehate. And that sounds the like the definition of bullying. If anything is worth censoring its bullying. But ye censorship is a dangerous path.  I dont know coontown  but i suspect thats the difference"
boogie2988,39detc,Krokcy,8,Thu Jun 11 09:24:22 2015 UTC,"I also respect freedom of speech, but that doesn't mean their speech needs to be on Reddit.  I wish Reddit would make an effort to shut down bigoted subreddits that are there to create hate and nothing else. Nothing is stopping these people from creating a forum elsewhere."
boogie2988,39detc,madchains,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:46:57 2015 UTC,"If they had clear consistent polices, that would be different. But the banning see,s to be haphazard."
boogie2988,39detc,GenericUsername16,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:37:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah true, though I don't lose any sleep when /r/fatpeoplehate cry about other subreddits not getting banned, it's just one group of jerks complaining about another."
boogie2988,39detc,madchains,22,Thu Jun 11 10:27:27 2015 UTC,Have they not been to SRS? That's gotta be one of the worst
boogie2988,39detc,Skooter_McGaven,10,Fri Jun 12 01:02:32 2015 UTC,"Going around and vote brigading constantly isn't acceptable behavior. And SRS is the biggest subreddit that promotes this type of activity; hell, it's dedicated to it."
boogie2988,39detc,exploitativity,-1,Thu Jun 11 01:54:54 2015 UTC,"srs has been dead for a while, it's not 2013 any more"
boogie2988,39detc,D4nkest,9,Thu Jun 11 03:02:51 2015 UTC,"I am all for their freedom of speech over at fatpeoplehate, but seriously fuck people that verbally harass or threaten people. Insult and fuss all you want on a forum, but leave people the hell alone."
boogie2988,39detc,rivfader84,5,Thu Jun 11 03:11:08 2015 UTC,"People misunderstand the whole concept of freedom of speech. Freedom of speech means the government can't arrest you for voicing a certain opinion. It does NOT mean you're allowed to be a loud, obnoxious asshole wherever you go and be free from consequences.   When I was in grade five, a kid pushed a girl off a swing he wanted. When the teacher gave him shit, his argument was, ""It's a free country! I can do what I want!"" It took a 2 week suspension from school to convince him that that's not how freedom actually works. (A bunch of other kids kicking the shit out of him might have been more effective as an object lesson, but that's beside the point.) This is the mentality of people who claim ""free speech"" in order to spread hate."
boogie2988,39detc,thudly,2,Thu Jun 11 01:39:34 2015 UTC,Agree with you if we are talking US constitution here. Disagree if we are talking about message boards on the internet. People can say what they want.
boogie2988,39detc,rivfader84,0,Thu Jun 11 20:06:39 2015 UTC,"The other point of freedom of speech is that it betters society. If only one group (whoever is in power, usually) are ever allowed to express their opinions, the world stagnates. Science vs. religion in the dark ages for example. There was no freedom of speech, science was oppressed, and the whole world suffered as a result, humanity was set back a thousand years because of it. Now, with freedom of speech, nobody can say, ""This is the only valid opinion and everyone else can shut the fuck up!"" Science is free to explore whatever they wish, and things are advancing once again.   fatpeoplehate, coontown, and their ilk are not advancing anything except their own ugly prejudices. Sure letting them speak freely is following the law to the letter, but it's a gross violation of the spirit of the law."
boogie2988,39detc,thudly,0,Thu Jun 11 20:12:59 2015 UTC,I've been lurking there for a while now (obviously not anymore) and the mods were very strict about any personal info. I believe it had more to do with its size and how their posts got high up in r/all as well as imgur's recent policy on removing fatpeoplehate images.
boogie2988,39detc,derblitzmann,17,Thu Jun 11 20:28:51 2015 UTC,"This is a problem that reddit has had for a long time, and it only will grow and grow until one day they decide to close all controversial subreddits.  It is a complex problem and it is difficult to mark the line where the content and opinions are right. I don't know how to do it with my own opinions so imagine doing that for all the people that use reddit.  Sure I don't understand why they are certain subreddits that aren't banned yet but I suppose its because they haven't cause any problems to reddit business yet.  Anyways thanks a lot for sharing your opinion."
boogie2988,39detc,juegos010395,5,Thu Jun 11 02:40:36 2015 UTC,Maybe some soft management of what content is shown on /r/All would help combat part of the problem? Reddit could impose very light filters with the intention of keeping /r/All accessible and enjoyable to the majority of readers.
boogie2988,39detc,GoogaNautGod,6,Thu Jun 11 01:24:11 2015 UTC,"I've heard people complaining about FatPeopleHate posts making the front page.  Thing is, isn't that determined by upvotes? The problem then is, some things which are very popular with some people will be very offensive to others.  I guess /r/coontown just isn't hitting the front page like FatPeopleHate was."
boogie2988,39detc,GenericUsername16,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:43:37 2015 UTC,Especially when you remember that (like boogie said) reddit has bills to pay. Unless they force a subscription service or redditors become more generous the admins will always face outside pressure to conform and ban controversial opinions.
boogie2988,39detc,dont_stop_smee_now,12,Thu Jun 11 08:21:40 2015 UTC,"BTW boogie, have you thought about joining /r/loseit ? Not for what others think of you, but if you ever want a bit more energy or lose a few pounds, there's a lot of good advice and support over there (not just right now, as FPH subscribers are still bouncing around everywhere)"

boogie2988,39detc,Athole,9,Thu Jun 11 13:46:53 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm getting too old to worry about some political stance of a website that people primarily use to browse pictures of cats. At this point, especially with the tantrum being thrown in /r/all, I couldn't give less of a shit about ""losing"" freedom of expression on here if it means the downfall of subreddits that harbor the worst attitudes and ideals I've ever seen in my short life as a human adult. Reddit isn't serious business. The internet is cool and all, but if reddit really does get out of hand with censorship, a new website will come along that will replace it. That is the nature of the internet. So, with that said, why are people even worrying about 'censorship""? If the things people care about with reddit start changing, they will move site. So, let reddit self-moderate. If it becomes a slippery slope, whatever. I don't mind the potential of having to find a new website if it means that shitty people can't be a part of the discussion. I really don't mind."
boogie2988,39detc,FranticBanter,-1,Thu Jun 11 15:26:12 2015 UTC,Thank you.
boogie2988,39detc,Memoryjar,4,Thu Jun 11 08:29:16 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with boogie, I think that having the subreddit a place you could avoid was good, if I felt like I needed to confront my hatred I could, but it was a way to know that yeah, there are people who hate you for something almost completely irrelevant, but fuck em anyway. I remember reading the ridiculous assumptions some of the people made and then even sometimes when reddit heard of it and brigaded it with kindness. To see the head mod berated by people who were not fat, actually felt great, and while no, I am not a 5000lb beast that can't walk, I am pretty big. Even though the subreddit bred hatred and disdain,  it still had some uses. and now boogie is right, they are leaking into other parts of reddit, by infecting themselves into other subreddits, sure they get downvoted most of the time, but then other times they get upvoted for saying something just as bad, but was kinda funny at times. So I don't think that reddit should have banned the subreddit, but I also think that reddit should not ban any website, I fully support any and everyone's right to free speech and free expression, and unless the police get involved I don't think that reddit should censor anything."
boogie2988,39detc,austin123457,5,Thu Jun 11 23:42:41 2015 UTC,I think Boogie made a great point when he said its personal. I see a lot of you guys asking why some other much worse subs werent banned and its because fat people hate personally offended the admins.
boogie2988,39detc,HaberdasherA,19,Thu Jun 11 01:46:03 2015 UTC,"Im pretty sure they got banned for doxxing people and not for the content itself, thats why coontown is still a thing (i dont agree on that btw). i think they doxxed an imgur staff member. Edit: to the people telling me they didnt do it i said ""im pretty sure"" so i didnt state it as a fact i just heard it."
boogie2988,39detc,BestSingedHawai,26,Thu Jun 11 07:44:25 2015 UTC,"This can't be true, as all the replacement subreddits with entirely different admins are also being banned."
boogie2988,39detc,iYokay,7,Thu Jun 11 00:44:10 2015 UTC,"The replacement subreddits are being banned for ban evasion. They are still the same community, and that community was just banned. They can't expect to just make another subreddit of the exact same thing and not get banned."
boogie2988,39detc,Silverhand7,4,Thu Jun 11 01:56:47 2015 UTC,"""Ban evasion"" used in this context is ridiculous.  They banned a community because SOME people were doing something bad (on a website where tons of other communities do the same thing with impunity) and then when people make a new sub that as of yet hasn't doxxed anyone, they get banned.  All I hear is that ""we're not banning ideas"", and yet they just banned the idea of /r/fatpeoplehate.  Ban evasion is for people changing their IP address, etc to get around individual bans.  This is about banning a community because they don't like what they are, pretending it's because the community is guity of doxxing, and then declaring people guilty by association."
boogie2988,39detc,violatedchimp,5,Thu Jun 11 08:43:15 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't have a problem with the subreddit if it was just about fat jokes, but I'd been on there before and I saw that when they say ""hate,"" they mean it. I'm not surprised that they went so far past jokes, so this is a good riddance.  As Boogie said in the video, this really doesn't solve much; however, I guess it does at least show that the reddit team is not OK with harassment, and there must be some value in that."
boogie2988,39detc,Nut922,6,Thu Jun 11 09:52:36 2015 UTC,"It's not about what the subreddit was about, it's about the fact that a subreddit was banned like this.  The beauty of Reddit is that you can avoid subreddits, and only visit and subscribe to ones you chose.    it's also very silly that other subreddits such as /r/coontown can remain, while FPH is banned."
boogie2988,39detc,iYokay,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:03:59 2015 UTC,"As they said, they had reports of harassment and the blame was on those subreddits. In this case, the content of those subreddits spilled out, and avoiding it was no longer possible for some people.  Reddit said that they didn't receive any reports about harassment from that subreddit, so there's nothing to be done. Like you said, just avoid going there."
boogie2988,39detc,Nut922,-2,Thu Jun 11 02:49:30 2015 UTC,"The thing is, fatpeoplehate was about having a safe place to express this opinion, and we, yes I say we, wanted to do our best to keep it. We did not doxx anybody, and if you believe we did I would like you to provide proof. I do not, under any circumstance, condone doxxing. We were very careful to abide by the rules. We ridiculed people based upon their own choices, and that was it. There was no other reason for the ban, besides it being an unpopular opinion. Downvote me if you want because I was a part of the sub, but I'm just explaining things a bit from our perspective."
boogie2988,39detc,NoobWithSkills,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:13:49 2015 UTC,"Coming from a fat guy...  Not that I condone making fun of people, hell I've been made fun of my entire life and it sucks being on the receiving end of it, and I for damn sure believe that it does more harm to people who are already fucked up in the head as it is... That being said, If people have nothing better to do than sit around and make fun of people on reddit in their own sub with like-minded individuals, that's totally their prerogative.  Doesn't matter to me in the least, although I personally think it's douchebaggery at it's finest.  But also I don't have to pay attention to it, I don't have to visit the sub.  It is my choice to read or not read the stuff... it is my choice to create an account and partake in discussion or debate.  That's what makes (made) Reddit great.  It was a place where you could get up on your soapbox and declare your love or hatred of whatever the hell you wanted with like-minded individuals.  To discuss any topics no matter how intelligent or unintelligent it is.    So as long as they didn't do anything fucked up like dox someone or go on a witch hunt and PM death threats or some shit, who the fuck cares?  Let them have their sub, let them voice their opinions even if it's unpopular.   While I think FPH is a completely ridiculous and stupid reason to hate someone, and frankly just a waste of energy,  I don't care either way if people hate me.  I'm sure if someone ever got to know me, they'd say.  Hey the guy's a blimp but he's a pretty damn cool dude.    If Reddit wants to start banning subs, they need to be fair all around... There are far more fucked up subs than FPH, and I think it's total BS the way Reddit has handled this.  FPH shouldn't have been singled out like they were as long as they follow the rules just like everyone else."
boogie2988,39detc,PianomanKY,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:46:06 2015 UTC,"The thing is, if reddit wants to ban some subreddits like fatpeoplehate, its time to move to a different website. Something like that should not be banned. I fucking hate that there are subs like /r/gasthekikes and /r/coontown. They are fucking disgusting places for horrible human beings. However, I think there could be an argument for keeping them if for nothing else than free speech, as long as they break no other rules of Reddit."
boogie2988,39detc,NoobWithSkills,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:26:39 2015 UTC,"Agree 100%... the problem is that if Reddit becomes a platform that tries to ban anything remotely ""offensive"", then they might as well just shut the doors.  What offends me, may not offend you, and so on.  Reddit's foundation has been basically ""Make it how you want it"" by means of what subs you do or don't subscribe to.  They either have to ban things across the board or not at all.  There's a fine line there that as has been shown in the past couple days that can snowball into a big fiasco.  Either ban explicitly hateful and distasteful subs altogether or none at all.  It's Reddit's website, though and they have the right to do what they please with it, however as it stands, and as Reddit has always been open for free speech for the most part, they can't just pick and chose what to ban or not... especially with the FPH vs subs like coontown... both are hateful and derogatory subs.  What makes one more intolerable over the other?   That's the problem.  It will certainly be interesting to see how it all plays out."
boogie2988,39detc,PianomanKY,-1,Thu Jun 11 20:41:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah boogie sure made a bad choice being  born into a psychologically abusive household. He definitely should have made a better choice there.  /s  Yes. I understand your point of view of hating people for making bad choices in their lives. Its just convenient that some people have made bad choices that are obvious and easy for you to hate on. Some people got born with lower IQs. Some people got born with less money. Some people got born a different skin color. Some people got born with genes that will have them get cancer. All people make bad choices, every stinking day. Though I personally think the worst choice you can make is to hate someone you don't even know because of what they look like. Regardless of weather or not they chose to look that way or not.   All that being said I agree with boogie that this is a stupid half measure and that censorship is futile. Obviously remove illegal stuff but if you want to be the ""front page of the internet"" and championing net neutrality and privacy and full disclosure and all that, you shouldn't be censoring what people are saying in a legal way, even if it is hateful. As long as its not harassing. I simply choose not to go to that subreddit and my day is fine. I don't feel that because a subreddit exists that means that reddit as a whole endorses that view."

boogie2988,39detc,xxfay6,0,Thu Jun 11 14:24:58 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your respectful response. A lot of Reddit likes to just start yelling and things get nowhere.   However, like the other user that replied to you, these are his choices, nobody else's. Also, I do not hate on anybody who doesn't make a choice to be that way. Different skin color, sexuality, gender identification, etc.: That's fine. I get it, you were born that way. You can go do you, and I'll do me. However, choosing to be fat is a different matter. It costs me money in healthcare, it furthers the ""fat acceptance"" movement that in all sense of the word is killing people, and it is just downright gross. Those are my views on that issue.  When it comes to your second point about censorship, we completely agree."
boogie2988,39detc,NoobWithSkills,-1,Thu Jun 11 03:52:59 2015 UTC,"I am not a religious person; however, I try to recognize wisdom no matter the source. The Bible says, ""Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.""  It also says, ""Judge not, lest ye be judged.""  I try to take those things to heart. I am not perfect. I have made choices in my life that in hindsight are terrible but I do them anyway.   Everyone makes bad choices. I would consider choosing to hate anyone a bad choice, yet here we are.   Do you hate everyone who makes bad choices or just fat people? Do you hate drug abusers? Do you hate alcoholics? Do you hate people who ride motorcycles without helmets? Do you hate smokers?   The truth is, I used to hate smokers. I used to hate smokers so badly that I had to grit my teeth would clinch my fists in rage everytime I smelled cigarette smoke somewhere. One time I saw a guy throw a lit cigarette out of his car and so I tailgated him with my brights on for 5 miles. Stupid aggressive shit.   But then one day it dawned on me that hating smokers was no different than hating fat people. It doesn't cause the smoker to stop smoking. I can't change the hearts and minds of other people. I can't change you, you can't change me. But I can change me. I chose to stop hating smokers. That doesn't mean that I like smoking or want anything to do with it. It just means in my day to day life instead of filling my heart with hate everytime I see someone lighting up, I just move on and get on with my life. Hate doesn't solve anything, it just eats you up inside.   I'm not saying you should love fat people. I'm not saying you should even like fat people. I'm not saying you need to even tolerate them. I'm just asking you to consider letting go of your hate for your own sake. You don't have to support the choices that other people make. You can even feel free to try to educate people on why being fat is bad. But hate ... hate does you more harm than anything. I would just ask you to try to live a day without feeling that hatred, then try living a week without it.   I get it man, you see these people as a burden to society and it just eats you up inside. But you can't really change them. People are gonna do what people are gonna do. But what you can do is not let it become who you are. Even if you think ""I just read the fatpeoplehate for 5 minutes a day, its nothing."" That's 5 minutes you could be thinking about something you love.   But, well, I guess if you love to hate, that's who you are, and I'll still accept that that's a valid choice you can make. I don't hate you for it. And I sincerely think that reddit is wrong to ban the subreddit for it. But I hope someday you can put down the hate and live and let live."

However, my view on what you are saying is that its okay to hate people for those choices. Whether you agree with that or not, it is my view.   The number of smokers has gone down exponentially over the past 20 years. Now, much of that is due to all the education about how bad they are for you, however, I would also attribute a significant amount of that decrease is because its simply not cool anymore. Many kids get ridiculed and called idiots when they choose to smoke, at least thats my experience. Why? Because its literally slow suicide. My opinion is that it is the same with fat people. They are literally killing themselves. Being fat is just as bad as being a smoker, and accepting fat people is detrimental to their health and society's health.  That is my two cents on your view."
boogie2988,39detc,NoobWithSkills,0,Thu Jun 11 14:23:09 2015 UTC,"I'm just asking you to consider letting go of your hate for your own sake.    The real point is, these people just like hating. The idea that it's the ""fat person's own choice"" is just an excuse. It's the same rationalization people used in the south during the time of slavery. ""God is white, so obviously n__grs are inferior and deserve to be slaves..."" Yeah, it's always somebody else's fault, other than the person doing the hating and oppressing.  Trouble is, in our modern, evolving culture, this can lead to backlash. It's no longer acceptable to be an ignorant asshole. So they cling to these rationalizations even more fiercely. They shout them from the rooftops.  Nobody's ever going to convince an ignorant asshole to change his ways, but good on you for at least trying to talk sense into him."

I hope you therefore don't hate anyone or wish bad upon anyone because of their actions.  That maybe you give your money to those less fortunate than you, as they didn't choose their situation any more than Boogie chose to be fat. You were just fortunate to not have been born in sub-Saharan Africa, or with an abusive mother, whatever.

That being said the root cause of FPH's, and associated subs, ban in this instance is actually external to the site as a whole. Imgur, the popular image sharing website spawned r/pics, decided to add a blacklist to its frontpage algorithm to block several unsavoury subreddits from getting images there (totally worth noting here that this is actually related to some internal Imgur BS about NSFW images and ""provocative"" content).  As a result FPH did what FPH does best, it hated on Imgur and the people working at Imgur. This is the root of the ban."

It was the constantly theft of copyrighted photos.      It was a mob mentality that required everyone there to join in the angry crusades against fatties.  And if a member didn't join the mob, the mob would turn on him.   It devolved into a pack of angry primates shrieking and throwing their paws in the air.  I'm glad reddit dispersed the angry mob.   Maybe it's not so easy now to see who are enemies.   But it sends the message that society (at least the reddit society) does not condone this type of behavior.

If something happened and people started brigading/bullying/harassing to the point that caused physical harm or could be interpreted as an illegal activity, there is now potential legal precedent for charges to be pulled against reddit and it's employees. By taking action against this kind of behaviour reddit could just be covering their own asses. ""Hey, can't charge us with anything, we tried to stop it."""

While society should be promoting fitness and eating healthy, fat shaming should not be tolerated.

boogie2988,39epbl,Robord,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:52:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed, although, I think one thing could be improved.     The people who are fat and actively try to promote the ""Healthy At All Size"" nonsense should be shamed.   I'm pretty sure ANYONE promoting the typical HAES stuff should be subject to feeling like an idiot. You cannot possibly say that being obese or skinny is healthy, it just simply is not. If you're obese, that's obviously an indicator of poor physical health, as is being too skinny with not enough body fat or not enough nutrients being consumed. Being slim, fit, or ""average"" would be ideal.   Personally, body size or weight doesn't change my opinion on a person. You could be the biggest man in the world who is the most caring and loving person and I will love you, or you could be the most ripped, healthy person who is an absolute fucking asshole and I will despise you. FPH had a decent central idea, to make it known that being fat is unhealthy and should not be glorified, but they were so incredibly backwards in practice and just hated anyone who was fat purely due to them being fat, like they were born morbidly obese and want being such a size to be accepted by everyone or something.   Maybe if there was a decent sub that was not so damn aggressive and treated humans with respect, they could actually be successful in conveying the message that being obese should not be glorified and that it is physically unhealthy. Just maybe then, people would believe that and it would make a difference. Unlike FPH, the sub that was just known as the place filled with hateful assholes, and nobody really even listen to them, so they probably harmed their cause more than benefited it.    And good luck, Boogie. You're the man.   We can all agree on this :)"
boogie2988,39epbl,seattlemama,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:15:24 2015 UTC,"I don't care whether someone is fat or not. That doesn't concern mean. However, being fat literally means you are unfit, or unhealthy, and this should not be celebrated.  Being fat is fine, because that's you, but it cannot be justified that fatness is good. A healthy lifestyle is good, and evolution supports this. Nothing against fat people, I have heaps of fat friends, but they are unfit/unhealthy. If you're hating the fatness of people, rather than fat people, that's definitely commendable. Work to remove and reduce fatness, not endorse it."
boogie2988,39epbl,seattlemama,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:54:41 2015 UTC,Noone should be shamed. Shaming is a terrible method and doesn't truly fix anything.

boogie2988,39epbl,PussyPass,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:47:20 2015 UTC,"I think it's important though to differentiate lighthearted mockery between friends from vile, horrific expressions of hatred for complete strangers. Internet or not, nobody is going to respond positively to most of the shit ""fat people haters"" have been posting even on this subreddit. Calling someone a whale and wishing they were dead is not ""joking around,"" it's psychopathy.   I also have a hard time believing the ""free speech"" side of the whole thing too because fighting words are not protected speech. And directly insulting someone and berating them constantly is most certainly fighting words. It all boils down to the simple fact that if people on fatpeoplehate actually wanted to help fat people improve their lives, their subreddit would have been named helpingfatpeople or something.  All that said though I have to agree with Boogie and others' general sentiment that shutting down the subreddit was a poor choice. Look at r/all right now for all the proof you need of that. Shutting down the containment chambers has allowed some pretty nasty shit to spread everywhere, and I'm not sure how well reddit will recover from it."
boogie2988,39epbl,seattlemama,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:12:59 2015 UTC,"This post shows a fundamental misunderstanding for what HAES is. HAES does not mean that literally anyone can be healthy at any size, or that weight cannot impact or even cause negative health conditions. HAES is a weight neutral approach. Simply put, HAES is about making healthy lifestyle changes independently of intentional weight control measures. Many people can and do lose significant amounts of weight while practicing HAES, and maintain that loss much more easily than they do if they lose weight by dieting. HAES encourages getting regular exercise, paying attention to how things like highly processed foods affect you, and eating in the way that balances taking care of your body and is still enjoyable to you. HAES changed my life. I am healthier both physically and mentally than ever before. I exercise six days a week, eat much less sugar and processed food, and eat lots of fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains, not to be a certain size, but because I feel best when I do these things. Throwing out my concerns about weight was paradoxically the only thing that allowed me to lose weight and keep it off."
boogie2988,39epbl,PussyPass,4,Thu Jun 11 16:56:13 2015 UTC,"""Intentional weight control measures"" You act like losing weight is some huge mystery. Take in fewer calories than you burn in a given day and you lose weight. When people say ""diet and exercise"" they don't (usually) mean some specific TYPE of diet. I think the influx of all these ""miracle diets"" has lead to a lot of people abandoning their hope of losing weight, simply because it didn't work for them. The best way that I know to lose weight is to stop eating as much and go running occasionally (or swimming, if running hurts your back/joints/hip/feet/whatever)  And while you may think the goal of HAES is as you say, you can't deny that there's other people who will look at it and go, ""Oh, I'm fat, I can continue to be fat and HAES says it's fine!""  And besides, my dislike of HAES is superseded by my belief that if someone is working towards getting healthier, they deserve support.  People that are fat and use HAES as an excuse to stay fat - Shame  People that are fat and use HAES as a way to lose weight - Support  I still don't support the core belief of HAES though."
boogie2988,39epbl,seattlemama,0,Thu Jun 11 18:44:47 2015 UTC,"If these people bothered to read the Health at Every Size book, then they would not be able to use it as an ""excuse"" to keep up unhealthy behaviors, because that is not at all what it's about. Please notice that there is a huge distinction between keeping up unhealthy behaviors and staying fat. Many of the healthy changes I have made had zero affect on my weight, but enough of them did that there was a long term downward effect on my weight. I still benefited from those changes, even if they did not have an effect on my weight. If weight had been my primary focus, I likely would not have bothered to make them.   As to your first point, while you are correct that in order to lose weight you must have a caloric deficit, how this is accomplished matters very much if you have any interest in maintaining the weight loss long term. The body of research on fitness, weight, weight loss, hunger regulating hormones, etc. is vast, fascinating, and often contradicts traditional beliefs.   As an example of one of many studies, consider this one:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21574706  What this study has shown is that perception about the food you are eating has significant measurable physiological effects on the levels of hormones which regulate the feelings of satiety. What this means in real world terms is that even just knowing that you are restricting your calories can make you feel hungrier and less satisfied than if you were to eat the exact same number of calories but not be intentionally restricting your food intake. This is one of the many reasons why typical dieting behaviors such as calorie counting, restricting certain foods and/or macros has such a shitty long term track record for success.   So when you say that you don't support the core belief of HAES, what you are actually saying is that you do not believe that increasing healthy behaviors with a neutrality towards weight is effective in improving health in individuals. How can you possibly support this opinion given the body of research we have which shows weight loss to be unsustainable in the long term for the vast majority of those who try to lose weight? Justify your position. Because it sure as hell doesn't seem to be supported by any research on the subject."

He's an inspiration among a few others that motivates me to get off my ass and do something productive during my free time once in a while. I also have a naturally fast metabolism and is considered skinnier than most people, no matter what I eat and no matter how little I exercise.

I don't spend any of my energy thinking of people who hate me. I don't care, if they don't like me, fuck em, can't please everybody. I do the weight loss for my health plus future, and for my wife. Boogie needs to do this for himself and not to prove fat shamers wrong. The thing is about hateful people is they will hate no matter what, it doesn't matter if he lost it all and has an 8 pack of abs they will still hate.

Not the Q&A format of his older youtube Q&As, but he does spend a lot of time in and out of game interacting with chat answering questions. One thing that I think puts him off doing Q&As often are the amount of repeat questions.    Before every stream he usually takes about 20 to 30 mins waiting for people to show up.  While he doesn't do straight Q&A, he is a lot more interactive with chat during this time.    He also seems to randomly have ""Let's talk about games"" for a while sometimes.  Like, June 9th's stream.  He spent about an hour talking about games while his internet connection was iffy before playing HotS.  Finally, he has mentioned ""Boogie Knights"" returning, usually around the same time people ask about a Patreon.  So he may be thinking of doing it as part of that.  All that said, I would love him to do more Q&A sessions more often."

I've always wondered what it's origin was.   I was watching Boogie ARK stream recently on past broadcasts and once again, Boogie decided to tell the story. I decided to see whether there was anything on his youtube and I found this."

You are one of the only Youtubers that can put a smile on my face after each video. Your content is one of the only things I look forward to throughout the week.   You have a gift. That gift is the ability to make others smile, but also to be an absolute inspiration.   I wish you the best of luck in your ongoing battle with obesity, and I have no doubt in my mind that you'll kick its ass."
boogie2988,390dyi,cheesedainish,16,Mon Jun 8 09:40:00 2015 UTC,"This is why we need to treat obesity the same way we treat people with drug addictions... because food is a drug. This is one of the main reasons im not a HAES supporter. Its not right. This isnt meant to be an attack at you, its just my opinion.   Boogie, your videos are the best. You are the only youtuber that i watch every video put out. You need to get on the right path. I have been watching you for the past 3 years, and every video you put out i love. Why dont you go back on your keto diet if it helped you so much? If that worked, you need to start doing that again!  You know we all love you boggie, but if you really want to make a differance, you and your wife need to do everything in your power to help it. Dont buy junk food. Keep it out of the house 100%. You have been on a slippery slope with your weight loss lately and it really makes me sad! You were doing so well. I respect the brutal honesty in this video boogie. You have what it takes to get better."

boogie2988,390dyi,PM_ME_YOUR_FORCE,25,Mon Jun 8 10:00:15 2015 UTC,"I wrote to Mister Rogers as a child. He wrote back a personalized letter, responding individually to comments on my family and whatever sport I was failing at at the time, and he ended it with an honest-to-gods signature. For a few decades I forgot how nourishing and supportive a presence can be, even if it's only on a screen. My mind's torch passed from Mister Rogers to Boogie about 30 seconds into the first of his videos I ever watched. I forgot how magical-there isn't another word for it-some people can be.  I'm almost 6 months sober now. Boogie and I don't share a specific addiction, but his heart feels like mine. I wish I could be for all the alcoholics out there what Boogie is to me, I wish they could find Boogie too. I fully intend to start using ""Boogie"" as a noun, meaning solace. In the moments when I feel weak, I remember three things.   Ogedei Khan's death was hurried, if not caused, by alcoholism. If alcohol can kill one of the most powerful civilizations in the history of the world, it can kill me. Addiction took Robin Williams. If addiction can kill Robin Williams, it can kill me. Boogie loves me. Everything will be okay.   This is shorter and less organized than I want it to be. And it's mostly in the hopes that Boogie reads this and gets something out of it.  Regardless, I love you guys. Boogie, I'll hear from you soon."

Though its not all bad i found you on you tube i started trying to create again and i got back in touch with an old friend (four years since i last talked to him) who is having as shitty a year as me. I tried to put my feeling in order to say something about this video but words fail me, the only thing orderly that come to my mind is a poem ill post below, but rage my brother rage.  Do not go gentle into that good night, Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  Though wise men at their end know dark is right, Because their words had forked no lightning they Do not go gentle into that good night.  Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way, Do not go gentle into that good night.  Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  And you, my father, there on the sad height, Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray. Do not go gentle into that good night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light."

boogie2988,390dyi,KerzenscheinShineOn,3,Thu Jun 11 19:51:13 2015 UTC,"So I want to preface this comment by saying this is NOT a hateful comment, this is NOT a comment meant to be mean or telling boogie how to live his life,  And this is NOT a negative comment in any way. It is a love filled comment and im just asking a question and maybe try to bring up some points or something maybe he hasnt thought of (Though i doubt there is much he hasnt considered) So just know i love you boogie!  So my question is. Why havent you tried doing lypo suction or gastric bypass?  Im guessing its 2 things, Either money/insurance issues, or its a ""I refuse to take the easy way"" mentality.  And well i have some points i want to make about both of those issues if they are in fact the reasons you havent considered it or tried them.  In regards to the money issue. Its expensive. Its super fucking expensive i know my aunt got both done and it cost a shit ton. But the thing is. From the sounds of it, with all the doctors appointments and ER visits and all the other medical attention you need it might be cheaper in the long run to get the surgery done so you can get healthier faster so you dont keep having all those medical issues.   Its like when you have an old used card that needs maintenance a lot. Every month you end up spending a hundred dollars for this problem and a hundred for that problem and eventually you get to the point where you spend so much money on this car that just buying a new one will be way cheaper. And from what it sounds like thats getting to be the case with your help. You keep trying to do it the slow and hard way and its costing you a lot of money so maybe getting the surgery done will end up being cheaper in the long run because it will help a lot of your medical issues. Thats just the idea im getting from the way you are talking about your issues. Maybe im wrong i dont know your finances but its something i wanted to bring up.  And in regards to the ""I have to do this myself the hard way"" mentality, well thats just silly. Its pointless to try and keep your ""honor intact"" if you end up bed ridden or dead. Its better to live and do something the easy way then to die trying to do it the hard way. And just because you get the  surgery does not mean its going to be easy. You will still have to work hard. By doing it this way you are just making it way harder on yourself.   heres an example. When you first start playing the magic the gathering you usually buy a booster pack to get a head start. Buying that booster pack doesnt mean you will win all the time though. You still have to work hard to maybe win games to get another card or something to grow your deck so you can play longer and win more. Your not going to try and build a deck by starting with no deck and then try and win a card every game. Its the same with your weight loss. Give yourself a boost by getting rid of some weight with lypo so that you can lose weight easier faster. (i dont know if that actually made the point i was meaning to make but i hope you understand)  And another idea i had while writing this is what if you go into rehab where they can control what you eat and when and they can also help you with your mental issues and maybe give you a headstart on losing more weight and set you up for success on your own. Just an idea i dont even know if they have something like that.  Either way im not trying to tell you how to live your life and im not trying to talk shit about you or anything im just giving you my advice because i care about you. I honestly never thought i could care so much about someone who ive never met in person as i do with you. I really hope you can make some progress and the best of luck to you i know you can do it!"
boogie2988,390dyi,joelthezombie15,5,Mon Jun 8 12:32:39 2015 UTC,I think he's said he doesn't qualify for the surgery cause he needs to be at a certain weight.
boogie2988,390dyi,KerzenscheinShineOn,-1,Mon Jun 8 13:31:16 2015 UTC,Well if thats true then I'd say maybe doing the rehab thing might help if they even have such a thing.
boogie2988,390dyi,joelthezombie15,3,Mon Jun 8 15:28:22 2015 UTC,"Gastric Bypass (Roux-en-y) or Gastric Sleeve procedure is NOT the easy way out.   To qualify for the surgery you have to do a lot of pre-work. You have to lose 10% of your overall body weight. You have to do a liver shrink diet. You have to prepare for the fact that for the next year you're only going to be eating about 800 calories per day which will most likely cause you to lose your hair along with your weight, as well as bring on new problems like vitamin deficiency.   But you're also missing the point of this video is that its as much of a mental battle as a physical one."
boogie2988,390dyi,ailyara,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:31:25 2015 UTC,I never said it was easy. But it is faster then trying to lose all the weight by normal means. It will still be hard as balls possibly even harder then losing it regularly but it will happen faster and with his health speed seems much more important when it comes to losing the weight.   And i know it a mental battle and thats why i also mentioned the rehab thing because it can help with everything and hopefully put him in the right frame of mind to lose weight.
boogie2988,390dyi,joelthezombie15,3,Mon Jun 8 16:24:00 2015 UTC,"Man. Boogie. You're doing great man! As someone who had the same relationship with food, literally. As a 5'3 woman, who weighed over 380lbs with so many medical issues, please don't give up. Ever. Eat to live, not live to eat. You will enjoy food so much more when you get there. Don't give up!! People love you so much <3  Edit to add: Btw I lost 101lbs over 5 years. It's been slow going, but going. As someone once told me:  Losing weight are like people going on a journey. You might take the wrong road occasionally and you might stop along the way, but in the end you get there."
boogie2988,390dyi,cherryberrygirl,3,Mon Jun 8 16:26:58 2015 UTC,"Boogie, you really are just awesome man. Don't let these assholes get to you. I am struggling with my weight as well and seeing you lose it just gives me the motivation to keep going with my diet. Keep being you <3"
boogie2988,390dyi,Nomad154,4,Mon Jun 8 18:52:24 2015 UTC,"I've linked to a few other videos on this subreddit and mainly with a sceptical view or a view to debate a video. (edit: Not related to the video but I did catch that in one point of a recent Boogie stream that he said recently people had said he did Francis stuff too much. I hope this wasn't a response to what I posted over here because I wasn't trying to say he was doing too much stuff. I wondered if specific reaction videos would get tiresome but concluded completely that it was a daft thought and Boogie would keep up with the great content)  However, I feel like this video is nothing but positive or at least very positive. Positive in the sense that I hope it impacts viewers and hopefully helps Boogie in some way, no matter how small.  And in all honesty, I hope that these videos help Boogie the most and the impact on viewers is minimal in my mind. Because people take a stance as if Boogie owes us to lose weight or that Boogie doesn't care because the progress may be minimal. Don't be so black and white. For the latter, there are countless things in real life where you could care as much as possible but progress remain minimal. I also don't think we should downplay just how much nerve it takes to make a video like this. (Please, don't start ""yeah but it takes nerve to _____ as well because I'm not making any comparisons, people start this way too often when a statement like this is made)    I think that this video was especially sad because lately I've been watching his streams on past broadcasts (I live in the UK and no way am I ruining my sleep pattern to watch them) and for like 95% of the time, Boogie is laughing and sometimes to the point of crying (The ARK streams are hysterical, actually had me laughing out loud which is something I rarely do to a video or stream) at points and this video was just a reminder of what Boogie goes through and has went through in his life.   I would REALLY like to know what impact making this video has had on Boogie. I know he's around here sometimes and maybe he won't read a long long comment but if you get down this far Boogie, I think we'd all love to know what making this video meant to you."

You are so much more than just a statistic. You're amazing entertainer! You may have quite a few reasons why its tough to lose weight but you have so many more reasons why you WILL successfully lose weight. Keep at it, you will be successful!"

boogie2988,390dyi,chicaneuk,2,Tue Jun 9 06:04:27 2015 UTC,"A little worried that despite all boogie says about the insults and cruel comments just being like water off a ducks back, that his weight problems are really getting on top of him. It seems there's been a lot of videos and comments by him about this in the recent months.  Really hope he can get on top of this stuff. He's an awesome personality and clearly a great guy and really deserves to be able to get on top of this particular demon. Maybe some time away from the internet / youtube and even going through some kind of clinic where you stay might be the answer, just to break the back of the problem and help him get into making some good lifestyle choices?"
boogie2988,390dyi,bothanspy1337,3,Mon Jun 8 11:45:58 2015 UTC,"I've gotten that vibe too.  I know what he's convinced that his lack of testosterone is part of the issue, but he's also made it very clear he isn't sticking to his diets.  Diets take time.  LOTS of time.  I""m currently doing a calorie cut and let me tell you, those first few weeks are absolutely brutal.  You can't the stuff you used to eat, and there's literally zero progress.  It's incredibly easy to get discouraged, but you come to realize a few things:  Firstly, losing weight isn't linear.  I'ts more like you'll lose a pound or two here, a pound there, the holy balls five pounds in a day?  Then you may not lose much for the next few weeks.  Plus, your weight will vary throughout the day, so just getting a good reading on the scale can be discouraging.  I can't say I've eaten to cover some kind of pain, but I do love eating... a lot.  You'll think that handful of oreos you grab at midnight don't matter that much, or ordering a pizza won't have that big of an impact, but it certainly can.  I know part of him gets this (why else would he buy something than immediately trash it?), but another part clearly overpowers him.  I definitely don't blame him for his issues.  It's clear that he was conditioned into this lifestyle, and he now suffers some serious mental health issues.  I think he should look into some sort of rehabilitation.  There has to be some sort of rehab center he can attend.  He needs to get away from all of this; YouTube, Reddit, etc. are not the places one goes to clear their head.  He needs somewhere where he doesn't feel obligated to work, and can focus on him and put together a longer term plan.  From what it sounds like, he's focusing too much on losing the weight, rather than creating a long term plan of healthy habits.  Obviously, the weight issue takes precedence, but eating on a super low calorie diet for six months just to put off some weight isn't effective for someone in his situation.  He has an addiction, and needs that treated as well.  I love this guy so much, and he deserves so much better than the shitty hand he was dealt.  I really hope he figures something out for the longer term.  He needs some serious mental health assistance.  That's really what the problem is.  As far as I'm concerned, the obesity is just a symptom."
boogie2988,390dyi,chicaneuk,3,Mon Jun 8 12:09:34 2015 UTC,"Great post, and glad to get such a mature response to my comment / thoughts.   The beauty of YouTube subscriptions is, if you don't post anything for a month or two, people aren't going to unsubscribe. So I don't think it would hurt him professionally. But it would HAVE to be worth it to help him really get some focus and some guidance.   It must feel like an impossibly large hole to climb out of but really there's no secret. A gradual introduction to some exercise, eat the right things, and some positive reinforcement to get you started - the feeling of wellbeing and the visible results would surely be the motivator once the pounds start to fall off.   I really hope he can get on top of it. Boogie's just so entertaining to watch, but also really nails the important issues too."
boogie2988,390dyi,bothanspy1337,2,Mon Jun 8 21:09:52 2015 UTC,"There is also the financial burden of stepping back from YouTube.  I know he's mentioned in the past he hates when he can't get videos out because that means he isn't getting paid.  I don't know what his financial situation is, but it's likely he can't live off of a fraction of what he is now, and pay for something like rehab — I don't think many people could.  YouTube pays pretty well with an audience his size, but it doesn't stretch as far as you would think.  I think that if he was able to take a break and focus on his health, he would have done so by now.  On the other side, maybe he needs the motivation, and stepping back would do more harm than good."

I watch them start to finish. I love hearing what you have to say. There is obviously things you are not willing to share with the public as you've had a very difficult past, but man would your autobiography be a good read.

boogie2988,390dyi,Pummy_,2,Tue Jun 9 06:43:07 2015 UTC,"I've been on and off your videos, Boogie. A fan none the less but always watch them in big doses. I just watched this video right now, and the last 2 minutes hit me so fucking hard. Last time i checked i weighed around 155kgs, in pounds that's around 350lbs; this was at the start of the year. Im scared to get on the scales to confirm because i can tell you now I am at 160kgs. I'm 24 years old.  I've known of how big of an issue this is, and I'm scared to address it. Last year I went to the theme park Movie World in Queensland, Australia. I wanted to go on the Scooby Doo haunted house ride so bad, everyone tells me its epic; I got on the ride and I sit in the chair and the bar doesn't go down. It hits my stomach and won't lock. I had my 3 friends around me (who are all body builders just about) and they were pushing down on it. Some hard pain right on my gut. The attendee wouldn't let me get off, she didn't want to embarrass me, which it did. This was the point i wanted to do something, but i haven't. And i hate myself for my laziness, i hate myself that i will sit here and let myself hate myself because of my choices and being fat.  Food has been my comforter ever since I was a child. I've always been the ""fat kid at school"" in the sense of fun and bullied. And I still get it now from people who I know or I don't. I don't why I am telling you all this Boogie. I really don't. Maybe for attention... I have no idea. But I know that your video has made me want to do something. I have never related to anyone, always felt like no one understands how it feels to be fat or obese. I have been that token fat friend to everyone like a poorly written 80's film.  In those last two minutes from when you say ""Sometimes I eat food when I'm crying"". I cried. I've been in that position. Everything from that point it hit close to home. This video made me want to get up and go and do something. Later tonight I will be going to the gym for the first time in 6 months. I'm going to do this now. For me.   I love your videos and I love you, dude. It helped me noticed who I am and that I can do this. It may not be worth anything, but I am going to do it this time. Thanks Boogie."
boogie2988,390dyi,malone_m,5,Wed Jun 10 06:40:39 2015 UTC,"I said it in the other thread but what Boogie describes as his diets is rather dangerous as he actually restricts his calorie intake too much (read : he does not eat enough when he's on these diets - mentions 2000 calories intake, even 1200 in some tweets ), it's absolutely not sustainable on the long term for a man this size, and it's extremely likely to fail ( that's why the good approach to this whole thing is to not be on a diet temporarily but alter the way you eat for good). Also exercising on a huge calorie deficit is very dangerous, you get injured very easily and the recovery is a lot harder and slower. Worse even when you are diabetic.  Every person who knows something on the matter will advise you not to cut below 25% of your TDEE ( Total Daily Energy Expenditure) without rigorous medical supervision, it may not seem like much but doing it for a whole year would result in a 125 lbs weight loss while maintaining about 3300 calories a day. 2000 calories a day, which is what he says he plans on eating whenever he's on a diet, isn't nearly enough and of course you can't stick to it.  2000 calories a day for someone his size is a 60% calorie reduction based on the TDEE. You would lose weight very fast in a few weeks, but on the long term you'd also lose your energy, go further into depression, your overall health would deteriorate,  testosterone would stop being produced and it's not as vital as the rest and it may not restart afterwards, also keeping in mind that being overweight tends to make what testosterone is available aromatized and converted into oestrogens, especially when the weight issue starts during childhood or adolescence. It happened to me and even now that I work out 4 days a week I have the tesosterone levels of a 75yo man because I binge ate when I was very obese as a teen.   Boogie you have all my sympathy but maybe a different approach to this issue would help. I'm the guy who used to order pizza for 8 and eat it  all in one sitting in the other thread, sometimes I puked it and sometimes I did not , the best way to not eat this shitty food is not to have it around, if it's there in large quantities or easy to get, you're very likely going to eat it. Control what enters the house, especially if you can't move around much. I sincerely hope you find another way to deal with your trauma than food as this seems to be the core issue, more than this or that diet.   Don't beat yourself too hard with these diets they are not supposed to be a punishment, be patient and realistic.

He has to keep going.   He has to do battle with his demons. We all have them. He has more than average but he has to go in with the mantra that the bastards will not win. Those dark forces swirling around his head are not what should control him. My own have to be kept on a leash, though mostly unsuccessful, they cannot be allowed to run rampant. Knowledge and acknowledgement are the first steps in that battle but that's just it - one has to duel them thereafter. He has to keep going.   It is hard. He has been through so much, but he has also achieved a great many things. Every time someone comments that he has helped them, that he has changed their life, is one less person who is suffering. He is a rock which people use to keep themselves from falling. We are his rock. We have to show him how much we care. If we did not care we would not be watching the videos of this man, this wonderful man. He has to keep going.   He has to keep going."
boogie2988,390dyi,Wonka_Vision,2,Mon Jun 8 12:05:44 2015 UTC,"Boogie's probably my favourite internet entertainer. The fat shaming that goes on on Reddit really disgusts me, partly because of the general rule of not being a dick to others, but you never know a person's medical background. There is so much that I hate about how viscous people are toward others for being overweight, and it's more often than not based on sheer ignorance. The people I meet who are obese are 9/10 of the time dealing with some pretty awful stuff, which can be an actual metabolic or psychological disorder. Of course, a lot of these shitty Redditors (and there are a lot of them) are males in their early 20s who have the metabolism of, well, males in their early 20s, and many of them, as they age, will become overweight. I just hope they receive the compassion that they never extended to others.   Anyway, you're awesome, Boogie, and I hope you're around for a long, long time."

It's not as simple as Boogie just wanting to lose weight and going and losing it. It's almost a conflict between his want to lose weight and the mental health issues or mental aspects etc that are always working against him. Although yes, he can achieve it no matter how hard it gets but this could all end in him only going as far as a try and I really wouldn't to label that a ""do not"".   What I'm trying to say is that, if Boogie doesn't win this struggle/conflict with his weigh and the factors that affect it, it doesn't mean he was a ""do not"" because I trust and believe that what Boogie is wholeheartedly trying to do is try."

boogie2988,390dyi,PussyPass,-11,Mon Jun 8 15:36:23 2015 UTC,"Newsflash:  Neither Sociology nor Psychology are considered sciences or scientific and those that utilize these particular ""humanities"" to justify their terrible choices are delusional.  People like him don't need advice or help.  They engage in willful self-deception to justify their poor choices and terrible lifestyle.  They KNOW what they have to do but they simply don't want to.  I have no interest in supporting someone, an entire class of people, that comprise approximately 67% (a total of 30% of our total population is considered obese) of our total population that are considered fat to the point of being unhealthy.  They don't want to address facts and deal with reality.  The best we can hope for is that they expire sooner or make conscious changes as they are crushing our health care system under the weight of their cascading health issues, lost work/wages and cost of care.  It's ridiculous."
boogie2988,390dyi,PussyPass,-6,Mon Jun 8 15:38:18 2015 UTC,"NO. IT'S. NOT. A. SCIENCE.  Here, let me help you to overcome your delusion:  Neither Psychology and Sociology aren't scientific, don't follow scientific method and they start with a theory and then attempt to shoehorn ""facts"" and ""data"" to prove their ""theory"". They, like you, are ridiculous. And this is why I don't suffer fools. Lets clarify here. Psychology and Sociology are NOT sciences and have no basis in in science, whatsoever.   For your edification, let me educate you on SOME of the entirely discredited psychological theories, demonstrated why/how psychology (and sociology) has no basis in science. Specifically, here is why it isn't and never will be:  Repressed memory theory; Physiognomy; Subliminal Advertising; Graphology; Engram (Dianetics); Primal Therapy; Characterology; Conversion Therapy (Gay to straight); reparative therapy; Memetics; Neuro-linguistic Programming (NLP); Phrenology; The Blank Slate Theory; COLD FUSION (just kidding, but it's bullshit and disproven also!).  I could go on and on. But the point is if you're stupid enough to rely or depend upon psychology and sociology for actual assistance and scientifically provable and replicatable results you're wasting your time. Psychology/Sociology aren't sciences. They don't adhere to the required rigors of science. UNLIKE science they start with a conclusion and then try to find ways to prove that conclusion correct. We call that confirmation basis and it's not science.   Psychology does not meet the five basic requirements for a field to be considered scientifically rigorous: clearly defined terminology, quantifiability, highly controlled experimental conditions, reproducibility and, finally, predictability and testability. Happiness research is a great example of why psychology isn't science. How exactly should ""happiness"" be defined? The meaning of that word differs from person to person and especially between cultures. What makes Americans happy doesn't necessarily make Chinese people happy. How does one measure happiness? Psychologists can't use a ruler or a microscope, so they invent an arbitrary scale. Today, personally, I'm feeling about a 3.7 out of 5. How about you?  The failure to meet the first two requirements of scientific rigor (clear terminology and quantifiability) makes it almost impossible for happiness research to meet the other three. How can an experiment be consistently reproducible or provide any useful predictions if the basic terms are vague and unquantifiable? And when exactly has there ever been a reliable prediction made about human behavior? Making useful predictions is a vital part of the scientific process, but psychology has a dismal record in this regard. Just ask a foreign policy or intelligence analyst. Don't trot Psychology out as proof of anything when psychologists are very, very skilled at making bullshit look like some elegant soufflé, and it's not science nor is it a valid method of engaging in a ""study"" or proof of anything.  It's always amusing when some circus clown who's specialty is psychology or sociology is offended when people, like me, who actually are scientists in STEM fields point out (accurately, I might add) WTF they're not even comparable as a science and never will be.    ""Boogie"" will die young because he's unwilling to make the necessary changes and is content to be implanted upon his chair watching himself slowly expire."

boogie2988,38z66g,malone_m,27,Mon Jun 8 02:01:46 2015 UTC,"Short version is simply because people are shitty.  Whenever I post there, I'm making my weight loss public.  Whenever I make my weight loss public three types of people show up  1) the /r/fatpeoplehate crew and their kronies.  They end up shitting all over everything I say and everything I do. I get death threats, hack attempts.  Most recently they found my phone number and harassed me until I had to change it.    2) the ""he's not even trying"" crew.  The folks who explain to me how easy it is, how lazy and stupid I must be, and what a worthless piece of shit I am.  They accuse me of lying, they accuse me of being ignorant, they accuse me being lazy.  They make me feel awful about myself and the untold psychological damage that comes from this really pushes me further into my rut, not out of it.  3) the ""we think we know best"" crew.  The ones militant vegans who tell me to stop eating meat.  The /r/keto crowd that tells me to eat mostly meat and avoid carbs.  The Atkinser's, the Paleo'ers, the Calorie restricting guys.  These guys mean well enough, but again, their advice is worthless.  At best its not applicable to me, but at worst its quite often contradictory.  If I were to try to take everyone advice at once I'd be walking 14 miles a day (mind that I'm now in a wheelchair when I have to go long distances), eating nothing but grape stems.  But also not grape stems because they're a carb.  So basically, I just can't talk about it publically.  It makes me feel awful.  If a certain small percentage of my viewers weren't assholes, I guess I still could.  But I can't, because they are.  If you want to see an example of why I can't be public about this kind of stuff just check /u/haberasherA's post history.  While he means well, its the exact kind of horrible feedback that destroys me mentally.  EDIT:  thanks for the gold!"

I can't imagine how difficult it must be to stay motivated with all the jerks out there who want to kniock you down, but somehow you do and it motivates me to be a better person and try harder at losing weight and managing my depression. You are a phenomenal inspiration and role model to me and so many others not because you've reached your goal, but because you never give up. Much love to you boogie, thank you for the great content and even greater lessons you give us who may be struggling."

boogie2988,38z66g,iceytoa1,3,Mon Jun 8 09:04:26 2015 UTC,"What about my post history exactly? You mean that post I made on my subreddit which I apologized for and you forgave me for? Other than that, I'm just trying to talk with other boogie fans about our thoughts and concerns about you and your content. There have been people here the past couple weeks who have given way more harsh and ill-informed criticism than I ever have. So I don't understand why im being singled out here.   And about the post I made to my sub: I admit I should have worded it better and clarified my points more clearly. The main issue I had was how there were so many inconsistencies with no way to clear them up. For example, you say you can't lose weight because of depression, how diets go well for you then a couple weeks later the depression takes over and you have to eat. But in other videos you have said that happiness and eating are not tied together. You can be happy and overeating or miserable and overeating, the two are not mutually exclusive.   So for fans who study your weight loss videos like scripture, it confuses me when I hear that happiness/depression is not tied to the eating but that you can't stop eating because of the depression. Thats pretty much the biggest concern I had and yeah, I fucked up and made a shitpost where I worded things crappy and made myself look like an asshole. I'll admit that, but whatever answer you wanna give I'm not going to be a person who says ""no thats not good enough"" and spits in your face. All I want is the truth, Boogie. Whatever the truth is I will accept it."
boogie2988,38z66g,HaberdasherA,7,Mon Jun 8 06:17:21 2015 UTC,"The problem is I keep telling you the truth, but you keep rejecting it.  But since I can't stream tonight anyways I'm gonna tell it to you again here and maybe make a video about it for the boogiedown550 channel, for fun.  about 4 years ago I decided I wanted to marry my wife.  I decided that I was going to take my weight loss seriously.  Many, many times I'd made this decision and many, many times I had failed.  I thought that I'd be able to overcome it knowing that if I fucked up i'd be leaving my wife a widow.  We tried two things, at first, with the advice of my Primary Care Physician(PCP).  We tried a low carb diet, which he felt would be great as I'm diabetic.  We also tried working out more.  I got a gym membership and we spent 4 days a week swimming in the pool.  (that's when I recorded my most viral video, the dramatic splash video)  About 6 months into this routine I first injured my back.  We tried to get it x-rayed, but were unable.  We tried to get an MRI but were unable.  The was debilitating.  I spent about a week in bed and we became afraid I'd never get out of that bad;  But I did everything I could and with my wife's help I eventually made it back into the livingroom.  I needed my wife's help for everything.  She literally had to walk me to the bathroom and back, which was less than 15 feet.  I stopped going anywhere and doing anything.  But I am persistent.  I kept pushing at it and pushing at it.  I refused to give up.  With some exercises my doctor gave me I started getting stronger, but it was slow.  VERY fucking slow.  We couldn't figure it out.  I was able to strengthen my core a little, my back a little, and my arms and legs a medium amount.  During this time, as you can imagine, I relied on my old crutch that is food.  I gave up on keto.  I had gotten down to 500 pounds, from 567.  But it slowly came back over the next year while I was recovering and not eating as well as i could.  My doctor checked my muscle mass and found that the ratios were absurd.  I had little to no muscle.  We couldn't immediately figure out why.    We kept trying new things, and nothing worked.  About 2 years ago we discovered why my back wouldn't heal.  My body simply was not producing ANY testosterone.  We tried a supplement but because of my weight and morbidity he was afraid to overdo it.  We slowly, slowly did it.  But this got me walking again.  This got me getting in and out of the car again.  This got me to vidcon last year.  This got me be able to go shopping with my wife again.  I was able to work out again and try again.  Since I had gotten to a new good place we started dieting again.  Sometimes its keto.  sometimes its low fat.  sometimes its all fruit.  sometimes its calorie restricting, but that's not really exclusives.  its ALWAYS calorie restricting.  we use myfitnesspal and we try to target what my PCP recommended:  2k calories a day.  The big problem I have is sticking with diets.  I am a DIAGNOSED obsessive compulsive.  You can see plenty of signs of that in my behavior, surely.  But the one that remains mostly private is my compulsive over eating.  If you've ever seen 'my strange addiction' its quite similar to any of that stuff.  Replace the girl eating foam compulsively and make her me eating food and you get the idea.  While I count the calories always, some days I eat 2000.  Some days 4,000.  Some days 6,000.    Sometimes I cry while I eat.  Sometimes I throw food away then dig it out of the trash.  Sometimes I sneak food so I don't feel ashamed.  Sometimes I punch myself, or hurt myself in other ways to try and convince myself that I don't need to keep eating food.   I tried locking myself into a room.  I tried taking away my credit cards.  I tried throwing everything away so I had no choice.  I still found a way to get to food.  What causes this OCED is my debilitating anxiety disorder.  I have DIAGNOSED  PTSD.  I suffer from attacks several times a day.  I tend to go for food when I do.  On the days that I am trying to diet and being exclusive (which is most days) and I can't have the one thing that really calms me down, I cry.  I throw things.  I break things.  I hurt myself.  I feel miserable.  I want to die.  I make plans to kill myself.  I think about quitting youtube.  I think about quitting life.  I think about eating.  Eventually, Instead of quitting youtube, or fighting with my loved ones, or breaking things I care about, or hurting myself in other ways... I eventually eat.  I always do.  Some days I go 3 days without fucking up like this.  Sometimes 5.  Sometimes 10.  Sometimes less than 24 hours.  But I keep trying, and trying, and trying, and trying.  I'll never stop trying.  I'll never give up.  One day I'll get it right.  One day I'll succeed.   If not, I'll die trying.  And that's it man.  That's the only truth there is.  IDK what else you want but that's the 100% of it.  Do with it what you will;  but what I ask for you to do is stop posting about it.  It won't make a huge difference but one less person drilling me about what a shitty shitty fucking shit i am will help.  I know you mean well, I really do.  I know you care.  I love that about you and regardless of how shitty I can be I LOVE YOU TOO.  but I'm dying here man.  I'm fucking dying.  I'm fucking struggling.  I'm in so much physical pain every day that I think if I wasn't as strong as I am, i'd kill myself.  Because of my obsessive disorders they won't give me any real pain meds so I'm treating it with fucking aspirin and ibuprofin.  I'm miserable as shit, but I still keep trying. This is the hardest thing I'll ever do and I'm genuinely beginning to believe I don't have what it takes."
boogie2988,38z66g,uberwolf0,8,Mon Jun 8 06:44:11 2015 UTC,"No one here thinks you're a shitty person, especially me. Just because you struggle with something like weight loss doesn't make you a bad person. This is exactly the kind of thing im terrified about whenever I speak my mind or ask questions about your weight loss. I'm terrified im going to be thrown into the category of assholes on FPH (i got banned from that sub for defending you btw) or random asshole vegans, or the anti-gamer feminists who will harass you for every little thing.  Fans like me aren't in any of those categories, we want you to lose weight and it bothers us way more than you think. Not because we think you're a shitty person for being unable to lose weight, but because its a serious fucking issue. And I know you're the last person who needs to hear its serious, but keep in mind some of your fans are just as concerned about it as you, you're much more than just a random internet celebrity to a lot of us.   But I really think you should make a video about this. Just paraphrase everything you just wrote, post it to boogiedown, and get this off your chest.

boogie2988,38z66g,uberwolf0,3,Mon Jun 8 07:04:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting this, there are a lot of stuff I didn't know.  So i really do not want to sound like an asshole  and I'm not telling you to do this or eat this specifically, BUT it seems like you are trying to do it too fast to be able to stick to anything on the long term.  Don't give into the pressure of people bullying you, you don't owe them anything and you don't have to do things for anyone but yourself, what matters is that you stick to it and improve on the long term, even if it is slow.  Based on your height/weight (approximate, I used 480 pounds as a reference but don't know your current exact situation), you have to eat 4400 calories a day to maintain your current weight, and your basal metabolic rate is 3600 calories. Be sure to count the stuff you drink as well, carbonated drinks, fruit juice and beer.  2000 calories a day for someone your size is extremely difficult to achieve and you would still  lose weight, albeit slower but probably more consistently if you ate 3300 calories a day. The thing is 3300 would be easier to do on the long term, you can then reduce it gradually as a lighter body would require a little less energy to function... Too much privation creates tension, cravings and if you can't sustain it, trying it may not even be worth it in the first place, it's NORMAL for you to break down and binge eat if your basis is 2000 calories a day. It's just extremely hard to achieve and ( I think) counterproductive for a compulsive eater, you're setting yourself up for failure a little bit. I weigh less than 200 pounds now and if I go several days on a 2000 calories basis I end up buying boxes of cookies and pizzas because it makes me obsess over food. Your body and brain need a certain amount of energy to function properly and if you deprive them too much from it, you create an imbalance that will eventually need to be compensated in one way or another.  I used a calorie calculator, there are many online but I like Scooby's (another youtuber http://scoobysworkshop.com/calorie-calculator/), I don't know more than you on this topic and don't want to come across that way, so you can just brush it off, but I've tried to lose weight through diets , extreme calorie restricting with good resolutions I would make one day and forget about the next week, puking,  and it only made me bigger at the end of the day. I only got myself together when I got a broader understanding of nutrition and found some food that are healthy enough to eat on a regular basis but also edible and tasty...Like, you can't live on spinach and broccoli alone :) At some point you go batshit and call Domino's Pizza to save you :p I used to do that all the time, and they kept sending me all these awesome coupons (specifically the pizza for 8 deals when I lived alone :s I guess they figured me out pretty quickly ) that I couldn't let go to waste.  Just want you to know, some of us can relate to your struggle, please take care of your health even if you do it in a private setting, we want to see you happy and hopefully getting to more and more events. You bring a lot of joy to people and your life is very important, the few assholes that take time out of their day to talk shit are still watching your content for some reason so you have some power over them. I really  admire you as a person and as an entertainer, and wish I had even half of the will power that you have to do everything that you've achieved. There's just this one area left that impedes you, and damn it hurts me to hear that you have to go around in a wheelchair :( It really does.  Take care  Best regards"

Some how they figured out that you had passed away and everyone was so upset and so sad I almost wished you were there to see it.   Nothing you say or do can please everyone and I don't think you should. Not everyone is gonna be friend and not everyone is gonna change unless it happens to them or their loved ones. I understand you want to be that person that makes others think twice but know that sometimes people aren't willing cause they're either afraid of change or just to ignorant to see it.   I can't know what it's like for you but I really do get it's shitty and I feel for you. You are in a rut and I'm sure you'll get over this bump in the road eventually. My unwanted two cents is perhaps instead of trying to please these people just try to focus more on pleasing yourself. You deserve it and I'm sure you'll come around again and feel a little bit happier.   In the mean time I'll be here or on Twitch with all the others waiting for you. :) You just need to give yourself some time and ignore all these assholes. You can do it and whatever happens we'll still watch and love you.

Either they have time to waste, they genuinely want to help or are doing it awkwardly or they are seeking cheap promotion by mentioning you in their vid instead of talkng weight loss in general. Doxxing and harassing on the phone is really crossing the line though :(  That's horrible.  I just hope that even if you do not broadcast it, you are seeing people and taking care of it behind the scenes ( therapist, nutritionist or physical trainer...given your years of abuse you seem to have a PTSD related to food issues, you have a pretty thick skin and a great sense of humor usually, I must say I did not expect this type of response). You are dealing with severe emotional pain and it's a little more complex than just eating less, but if you do not address your relationship with food through therapy and go from diet to diet, the problem will most likely keep coming back. ( Also ""dieting"" is not necessarily a great idea, but changing your food habits forever in a way that is sustainable for you would be better . A diet is limited in time, restrictive, and when it's over or when you don't manage to stick to it because it's too hard, you're back to your old habits and reward/coping mechanisms that got you there in the first place).  Succeeding would be the biggest ""fuck you"" to the people you find annoying too :)  I would love to see you hanging out with Obesetobeast , I know you're not from the same generation but he's been through similar phases and I think he'd understand your backstory more than someone who has never lived with morbid obesity.  Best of luck mr Boogie, I respect your choice not to make this public anymore, just wanted to see you get better as the only news we get about your physical condition, grasped here and there through some of your recent videos are generally bad...You have helped a lot of us and we would like to keep you around happy.  I was obese as well,the only reason I didn't get into the morbid state because I started making myself puke on the nights where I ate pizza for 8...Then I picked smoking, then I got addicted to working out but it's still an addiction and there's still a lot to work on. The people who leave comments are not perfect and if they take time out of their day to watch your videos, it means that you've made a small difference in the world. Even for these fatpeoplehate crowd, they are seeking validation by putting others down but if they really felt secure in the bullshit they tell themselves, they would not resort to doing that.  Why are they even fazed by the stuff that you do and why do they watch your videos? This attitude tells more about them than it does about you, please don't let a few assholes bring you down, you're an awesome person.  Sorry if I said something wrong in this post, English is not my native language and I know it's a delicate topic .  Wish you the best !"

I used to be an internet troll as in I'd log into a game of warcraft 3 and type memes into chat to annoy people.  Never have I ever hacked somoene's account in an attempt to take away their livelyhood.  Never have I found their phone number and harassed them.  Never have I found out where someone's wife worked and threatened to kill them.  Never have I put a hit out on the tor network for someone's life.  That's what these people do to me.  Its a bird of a different feather, for sure. I hope you can understand that.  Best of luck with the things you're struggling with.

I think they are jealous of your success on youtube and try to break you where they sense weaknesses (they will pick on anything, your size being the easiest one, but remember it comes from a place of insecurity on their behalf if they bother to do this in the first place, whatever shitty content they post, it's not really about you), and if they can't reach you they threaten your relatives.. Fucking vultures... It makes me really mad because you are so open and honest in your videos, and I guess this kind of harassment only reinforces the addiction issues you deal with...:( This is kind of why I ended up isolating myself, I was tired of always being told how inadequate,and shitty I was, and I really admire that you keep going despite all the abuse that you get. It's certainly easier to brush it off when it's not directed to you .  Thanks for your support, it means a lot!"

Make a high tier like 20bucks or smtg and give a reward like a google hangout to talk about anything at all and your weight loss journey. I'm sure people will contribute.

With that, all I have to say, Boogie, thank you for all of your heart and soul that you've poured into your YouTube and Twitch.  I rarely comment but I always watch and support your efforts (including watching all ads on both networks).  I just want you to be happy in this life dude."
boogie2988,38z66g,HaberdasherA,2,Mon Jun 8 06:09:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think its an inappropriate post dude, many of his fans wish boogiedown wasn't abandoned. But what you said has some truth to it I think. Boogie is in one of his ""dark phases"" where he wont give any updates on his weight. Last thing I think he said was that he quit Keto again and was starting some random vegan diet.   I've honestly lost track at this point. Boogie's weight is what I care the most about, but its really difficult to get information about it. You can't ask him directly because it upsets him and he'll just take it the wrong way. You just gotta get lucky and hear him talk about it for a minute or two on one of his twitch streams.   He did say he had some ""serious"" videos planned for this week, but the feminists scared him into not posting them. One of those videos may have been a weight loss update, but who knows.   But this isn't the first time boogiedown has been abandoned. The same cycle has been repeating itself for almost 4 years now. Boogie starts a new fad diet, he will start losing weight, he will post to boogiedown, he will continue to lose weight, then he will stop posting to boogiedown, then boogie will reappear months later with an excuse video.   Whats sad is that I know if he posted regular to boogiedown, at least once a week, then I know he will lose weight. The boogiedown videos keep him accountable and they have been proven to work. He only gains the weight back when he stops posting there. Boogie always is searching for the answer, but the answer is boogiedown. Posting to boogiedown works, while all the fad diets, DDP, therapy, etc. all fail."

Ever since you called me out on twitter I have tried to be more positive and give you constructive criticism in the nicest way I can think of.   I'm looking at the posts I made in the last few weeks and they are nothing but compliments and me defending you, I even went to ghazi and defended you when they were trying to tear you apart.  I fucking LOVED your fat hatred video, I said earlier that this was (in my opinion) the best video you have done in years. I had virtually all positive feedback when it came to that video and videos like it. So please don't let what you think I or anyone else is going to say stop you from posting things. I've said before I love serious videos, especially videos about weight loss because that shit is real to me. I would NEVER give you negative feedback for posting those types of videos because they are my favorite and I think they make your channel stand out.   If what you're saying is true and I am the sole reason why 2 million people aren't getting serious videos then I guess I'll just stop posting any feedback here. I don't want to stop posting because I am a very passionate fan, but it wouldn't be right of me to have 2 million other fans lose out on a video because I felt like speaking my mind."

I guess I'm older than most Boogie fans and enjoy the vibe of the twitch streams. (Boogie and I could have gone to high school together).  Some of the stuff is pretty out-there at times and that's fine. I am too. Pretty often when I play alone I talk to myself about what's happening or something in the game pisses me off and I say and do similar things Boogie does. Pleasing everyone sucks. I for one, LOVE the twitch content, so you know, you like what you like I guess."
boogie2988,38n0ql,Brewtooth,3,Fri Jun 5 23:55:16 2015 UTC,"Nope, i find it hilarious, i've been on twitch for years and his late night streams are hilarious, the singing, rapping and overall hilarity is the best i've seen on twitch.  I don't think hes over the top, he seems to act like himself.  On his youtube he's calm and collected because he talks about more serious issues as opposed to on twitch he's playing some games and just having fun.  Really if you don't like it just don't watch, same way i don't watch pewdiepie because he's fucking obnoxious, but at the same time i don't go to his videos saying how i don't like him as that does nothing at all.  In hindsight this thread is completely pointless."
boogie2988,38n0ql,JohnCoffee23,5,Sat Jun 6 02:40:51 2015 UTC,I think it depends what time you stumble in there. He waits a good 20min to start a game to let people get in there and that's when he'll talk about serious stuff or things honestly bothering him. I think for him streaming and playing games he can forget all the internet and life drama and just gets carried away with it.
boogie2988,38n0ql,KerzenscheinShineOn,3,Fri Jun 5 11:12:43 2015 UTC,"I sadly have to agree, I can't watch his twitch much and for long because the nonsensical yelling and screaming starts to grate on my nerves after less then 5 minutes. I don't necessarily hate the streams but I don't tend to watch twitch for the form of entertainment so it just flops for me. His youtube channel has also gotten...well HaberdasherA said everything I was planning to say perfect about that.  I just wish Boogie would be more chill on twitch and just stream games without the constant breaking into songs and yelling about something, anything he can find. I just want to see Boogie play games ;_;"

Saying something with 2k viewers is going to offend a lot less SJWs than saying the wrong thing on youtube with 2 million subs, and boogie knows this.   So im glad boogie acts the way he does on twtich. I enjoy boogie being his loud and offensive self way more than the ultra PC, jumpcut editing, castrated boogie we see on youtube now.   Boogie's youtube channel died when he tried to appease the SJWs. Boogie doesn't realize that no matter what he does, no matter how much he bends over backwards, the SJWs will not like him. He is a white cis male and stands for everything they hate. He makes an awesome video on fat hate and the SJWs turn it around to be about misogyny. This is the kind of shit that has boogie terrified to make videos besides the francis videos and the jumpcut game news summaries."

boogie2988,38n0ql,LeonfromAustralia,1 point,Fri Jun 5 09:31:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah i seriously hate jump cutting. I don't even know why boogie started doing it because he is/was a very talented speaker and could speak for hours without missing a beat.  I mean I can understand why youtubers who suck at speaking like Mr. plagiaristzion or sky ""women have life on hardmode"" williams would want to use jump cutting so their videos don't look like a joke. But boogie was great at making 10, 15, 20 minute long talking videos with no editing.   Seriously, look at this video boogie did a while ago for his weight loss channel. This is, in my opinion, the BEST video boogie has ever done simply because of how fucking real it is. 14min long, no editing, a serious topic that engages the viewer, that video has everything. Instead most of what he seem to get now is boogie doing his best sky williams impression for 4 minutes about some random topic that was on the front page of /r/games the day before."
boogie2988,38n0ql,HaberdasherA,1 point,Fri Jun 5 09:43:28 2015 UTC,Yeah man I know that video well. I use to watch the boogie down channel more than I did his main one because I felt it was more of a personal channel.  That channel is pretty much dead now though =/ along with the character Jessy too. Some of Boogie best videos are his old rambling videos that were totally UN-eddited.  Ahh the old days.
boogie2988,38n0ql,LeonfromAustralia,2,Fri Jun 5 09:47:46 2015 UTC,"Boogie man. If there is a legitimate reason you need to jump cut that's fine man, no issues. Let us know these things so we aren't left wondering.  Sorry man it's just personal opinion, I tried actually going back and watching some older steams but singing a song about dilo calidoscope for like 5 minites get's annoying. I am constantly having to hit the mute button because of the screaming/yelling.  When you get as big as you have on youtube your fans are going to be divided. Personally I loved your old rambling videos, it felt like back then you just turned on the camera and talked to us.. like we were part of your life, everything feels so micromanaged now. I feel you are under pressure to just please everyone also, not offend anyone... man that will never happen. Someone will always get offended by the smallest thing. I would love for you to just go back to what made you good, back to your roots."

Boogie down 550, Jessy, the old school fucking videos that made me love you man, talking about shit that matters like suicide, depression and hope, and anxiety... You never do them anymore cause I feel the majority of your fans don't like that makes you feel pressure to put content out that everyone loves.  I am upset because I am passionate about your channel. Sorry."

People shit all over me for it.  I had two more scheduled, one for today, and shit canned because of that negative feedback.  Jessy is a character no one got.  Boogie down 550 got me screamed at by militant vegans.  Francis videos get me yelled at for either doing it too much, or too little, or just not right in the right way.  Gaming videos are Boring apparently.  Non gaming videos are just me whining.  There is no winning.  No matter what I make someone is going to shit on it.  It's a rough job.

Heck, just look at all the comments where the person says that you saved their life or even helped them through a rough patch.

I thought you said you werent afraid of them anymore, I thought we were going to have a serious video renaissance this year but I guess the SJWs have silenced you once again.

boogie2988,38mrrm,sumrexnox,2,Fri Jun 5 17:03:57 2015 UTC,"Boogie's francis character reminds me a lot of what happened to the george character on seinfeld. in the first few seasons george has a variety of emotions. he was insecure, self loathing, oblivious, egotistical, lazy, angry, depressed, etc. all of these emotions were used to great comedic effect in the first few seasons. But towards the end of the show I guess the writers thought people liked it the most when george got angry, so from then on george was just angry 90% of the time. Any little thing and george would just scream and stomp around for the entire scene while the audience cracked up.   Same thing has happened with the francis character. Its all about raging and banging on shit and doing the same thing over and over. I guess boogie figured the only funny thing people liked about francis was when he raged and banged on shit, so he just streamlines that on every single francis video ad nauseam.   I personally haven't enjoyed a francis video since 2012, but the sad part is these videos get the most views and the most likes. So you bet they're not going anywhere."

boogie2988,38i716,Lucretius_Black,6,Thu Jun 4 11:27:08 2015 UTC,"First of all, devil's advocate: In common parlance, a devil's advocate is someone who, given a certain argument, takes a position they do not necessarily agree with, for the sake of debate or to explore the thought further.  I find these videos quite funny and Star Wars and Mad Max videos were actually really good. I would have enjoyed a serious video with Boogie being Boogie talking about Fallout 4 just as much as Francis though.    However, are they going to be too much if he does one for ever game/film that fits into his channel or that he likes? He can do what he wants and I won't complain one bit because I really enjoy his content still. Basically, wanting to see other peoples stances on a question that I thought of even if I don't agree with the question itself.Also, they do fit into his channel so not really bad at all..  I still find them funny but if there's a clump of releases of films and games (such as later in the year) could response videos wear off a bit? I would be confident that he would be able to keep them funny though. Sort of devil's advocate. Also, I'm convincing myself more and more that there is little to go against doing them.

I don't watch every video that's put out by the 'big' YouTubers I subscribe to, only the ones that interest me.

boogie2988,38i716,boogierocks,4,Thu Jun 4 13:29:58 2015 UTC,"I never bitched about the creation of these videos. I like them and I watch them. I personally don't think they're too much hence why I said that by posing the question, I was basically playing devil's advocate.  Devil's advocate: In common parlance, a devil's advocate is someone who, given a certain argument, takes a position they do not necessarily agree with, for the sake of debate or to explore the thought further.  Clearly haven't read my comment or grasped the concept of devil's advocate. I like the videos and I watch them. I was posing the question as to whether if they kept coming out, people may get tired of them. I probably wouldn't. So, I didn't really bitch at all and rather I wanted to see what people thought. I say in my comment, maybe it was a stupid question but I thought I'd pose it anyway. I also said that ""I'm convincing myself more and more that there is little go against doing them"" as in, if loads came out, I can't really see anything wrong with that because I'd have confidence in Boogie that his content would always be enjoyable. I don't mean to come across that my confidence or approval is something that is even needed, if it came across that way.   I just wanted to an air an opinion that I thought of (although pretty much disagree with) on the relevant subreddit."

The trick is to clearly see the line between reality and truth and the lies your own mind will tell you when its depressed. If this line ever becomes blurred, you might not see any hope out there. It's also very important to see the truth about what's really your own fault and what's just life being randomly shitty. If this line becomes blurred, you start to feel like you can never do anything right. But honestly, your own mistakes are the one thing you can control in this life. Everything else is just bad luck, and you shouldn't blame yourself for any of it."

The thing is, straight criticism is the truth, and the hateful element is the way the person relaying the straight criticism feels.  This is a refuge for people who don't go ""You tried"", ""I can do it later"", ""I feel so sad"". FPH is a straight up ""Fuck you you lazy bastard just do it""  FPH's method is very blunt, but it's the thing that works the best if you just man up and realize you have to put emotions aside if you wanna get something done once in a while.  After all, being fat IS A CHOICE. You CHOSE to eat that cake. You CHOSE to order that pizza. No excuses. Healthy food is cheaper than fast food in bulk even. It just hurts people to realize you need a little self-control to stay fit.  IF being fat wasn't a choice, I would not like that sub. Say, a sub for hating people with disabilities I would think is just horrible, because they didn't chose to be born with disabilities.

Hate is a horrible thing, trust me from someone who knows I used to get lost in my hatred of people years ago and it was eating me alive, I thought it gave me strength but it was quite the opposite. The posters on FPH are all cowards, they are afraid, that is why they hate. They fear death. They see a big fat jelly belly and are terrified of it.

boogie2988,37dqd2,HaberdasherA,-1,Wed May 27 00:02:30 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't go that far to say it doesn't affect them in the least. Don't get me wrong, I think there are a ton of assholes on FPH, but don't try to downplay the impact of obese people on everyone else.   For one you gotta take into consideration many obese people are on disability and refuse/can't work. This puts more stress on the tax payers because they're paying for something which is completely preventable.   From my own experience, back when I used to work retail I had to work with a lot of obese people. The thing that bothered me the most (besides the bullying, which still goes on at my current job to a lesser extent) was just how lazy they were. And don't even get me started on the ""not all fat people are lazy"" excuse. Being obese is a byproduct of being lazy and/or eating too much.   So my obese coworkers would never pull their own weight. They would spend most of their shift sitting in the break room when they weren't supposed to or leaning against one of the fixtures texting. Meanwhile fit people like me were running all around the store for 8 hours straight trying to clean and fold everything.  So I was doing probably 10 times the amount of work in a day compared to my obese coworkers. And I didn't have a choice because if the store wasn't clean then we weren't allowed to leave and the boss would yell at all of us, not just the lazy people. And we were all getting payed the same amount.   Whenever I tried to encourage them to clean their own department without me doing most of it for them, they always had an excuse. ""My legs hurt, I have a knee condition, im tired today, i dont feel good, im sick, etc."""
boogie2988,37dqd2,Xdeser2,2,Wed May 27 06:42:08 2015 UTC,"Funny, I work retail with 4 Obese co-workers and they're the least lazy people on the front-end team. Motherfuckers TRUCK to get shit done lol.  As for the tax excuse, I feel like thats not valid, considering your taxes wouldent be lower if some obese people werent on welfare, considering Social Security/millitary spending if you live in the US or universal healthcare if you live in Canada or most of the EU"
boogie2988,37dqd2,HaberdasherA,3,Wed May 27 07:45:59 2015 UTC,"Thats funny because I always hear this type of response. Someone's always got this obese friend or coworker who is the most hard working active person ever. I have yet to meet this person in all the jobs I've had over the years.  Also it begs the question, if they have such amazing work ethic and aren't lazy at all then why are they obese? I was carrying two 45lbs dumbbells the other night at the gym and it was a pain to walk across the gym with them. I can understand from that why fat people would want to be lazy at work or in life in general when it is that much of a hassle to simply walk. But on the other hand I can't imagine why someone would prefer to be like that when they are fully capable of changing it.   If your obese coworkers are as hard working and active as you say they are, then whats stopping them from losing weight?"
boogie2988,37dqd2,Xdeser2,0,Wed May 27 07:53:26 2015 UTC,"First of all, I dont have all the answers, sorry. I'll never claim to be the most in intelligent person on this _(ツ)_/¯  But heres my take on it nonetheless; Sometimes life deals someone a shit hand. Maybe someone has to work 9 hours a day or 2 jobs and by the time they get home, they're too dead tired to go to the gym or bother to cook a healthy meal. Obesity also spreads with poverty, considering cheap, carb filled yet nutrition-deficient food is pretty cheap.  Also, its never as easy as just exercise. People have an entire schedule of daily life to work around (including long work weeks). Maybe they also have kids along with the work week or college load. its hard to find time in adult life to do that sometimes and still maintain a social life, a career/job and have some downtime to themselves.   Personally, I try to make it a point to not criticize someone on their weight. everyone has some deep-seated fucked up issue with their life. Fat people just have it closer to the surface. (Not saying you insult fat people, just how I feel about that lol) TL;DR Life is complicated, yo! and its never as easy as ""just do one thing"".  Edit: Only editing so much because I think of better ways to say something lol"
boogie2988,37dqd2,HaberdasherA,1 point,Wed May 27 08:03:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah but those are all excuses. If someone truly wants to lose weight then they don't make excuses. Eating healthy doesn't cost you more or take more time, thats one of the biggest myths out there. Just off the top of my head I can tell you buying rice/chicken in bulk and spending 30min to cook it for the week is a lot healthier and cheaper than that 10 dollar combo meal at the fast food place. Also drinking only water is the cheapest and healthiest thing you can do. Problem is people are lazy and they don't want to put in an effort to change their lifestyle and instead will make excuses like ""i dont have time"" and ""I dont have the money"".   As for the exercise, there is no excuse to not exercise. If you're really dedicated then being tired after work isn't an excuse. I go to the gym 6 days a week after work, some nights I am fucking exhausted with a headache or even with my nose being a snot fountain because of allergies. I do not make excuses and I go every night after work.   And im not even trying to lose weight, im trying to gain weight. Thats how easy it is to lose weight when you're dedicated enough. Most people don't even need the gym to lose weight, just your BMR alone will give you a deficit if you don't eat a ton of crap every day. So there really is no excuse when it comes to weight loss."
boogie2988,37dqd2,Baldr12,2,Wed May 27 08:14:04 2015 UTC,"You could consider that they simply are not interested in being healthy.  For example I like to smoke tobacco and I don't care about the problems involved.  But I agree with you if someone says ""I don't have time or money"", because If you want something you always find the way."

You just brush aside everything I said and say ""Oh its fine they can just have their entire life AND find time to do intense time consuming exercise"", no, it does not work that way for most people.   As for food, its not a myth, its well documented."
boogie2988,37dqd2,HaberdasherA,2,Wed May 27 09:11:54 2015 UTC,"No sorry, they are excuses. How long do you think exercise takes? You can do 30min of cardio a day easily. Don't try to pretend there are all these people working 18 hours a day, 7 days a week who literally have no time to exercise.   But the exercise isn't even all of it, eating healthy is the biggest part of weight loss. Your main argument was that eating healthy costs too much and is too time consuming for people. But thats just not true. You say its ""well documented"" but fail to provide any source or information for where you're getting this from.  I even debunked it in my other comment. How much does a fast food meal typically cost now? Like 10-12 dollars right? You add that every day and you're spending 100+ dollars a week on garbage food.  My example was buying chicken and rice in bulk, that stuff will cost you around 20 dollars and feed you for the entire week and take like 30min to cook. Hell, if you actually give a shit you can just google ""eating healthy on a budget"" yourself and see a million other alternatives which are CHEAPER than fast food.   So once again, there is no excuse for eating like crap. Its just that people don't want to change their lifestyle so they make excuses."

And it is really sad seeing so many people going ""Oh my feelings, please don't tell me something I don't like"", and yes I do agree that there are some people and mods that are a little bit over the top."
boogie2988,37dqd2,HaberdasherA,1 point,Wed May 27 20:53:05 2015 UTC,"Thats one of the things I like about FPH, they don't tolerate excuses and they aren't afraid to tell the truth despite all the people they piss off.   But I don't agree on some other things, like how they are against encouraging fat people to diet and exercise. But yeah the mods are out of control on that sub. They are way too ban happy which limits any kind of real discussion.   Also I think that sub is causing some average weight and thin people to have inflated egos. As if not being fat is some sort of an accomplishment. Not eating like a pig and staying thin shouldn't be something to pat yourself on the back for, its not difficult."
boogie2988,37dqd2,nicktrivi,9,Thu May 28 01:58:06 2015 UTC,"As a read of FPH I have to say that it really has derailed in recent weeks. When I got in they were all about hating on those that shamed thin people and made being overweight look like the better lifestyle, which is downright stupid. But now its become a grab for anything to grab quick karma at the expense of others. Boogie is some-one that I personally like because he actually encourages those who are overweight to lose the weight without losing touch with themselves. Which is exactly  the type of balance I and many others think is the right lifestyle to live. So from a former or current subscriber to FPH (i dont remember) I apologize."

boogie2988,37dqd2,nicktrivi,1 point,Wed May 27 07:18:52 2015 UTC,"I really dont, being a med student I can tell you how hard it is to lose that kind of weight once you reach a certain point, If I was his doctor I would definitely recommend surgery just so he will have a bit of an easier time losing a bit more. He should have never let himself get to this weight, obviously, but he realized all too late and I believe he really is trying to lose the weight. Obviously we can never know but for the sake of my own sanity I will take the optimistic approach. I don't think he can ever really lose the weight but it is possible, It would take ALOT of work but it is technically possible. We will just have to wait and see I guess..."
boogie2988,37dqd2,i_type_stuff,0,Wed May 27 17:18:05 2015 UTC,"That is completely untrue. For someone that large (550+ pounds), even while not doing any exercise at all, he would need to eat 4.5k cal a DAY to maintain that weight. Maybe it would be hard for him since he leads a crap lifestyle to begin with, but eating less then 4.5k cal a day should not be ""ALOT of work"".  edit: corrected cal amount"
boogie2988,37dqd2,nicktrivi,3,Wed May 27 17:35:05 2015 UTC,"Well it also involves health man, like you cant drastically change your bodies intake on a whim its extremely dangerous. I mean look Ashton Kutcher was hospitalized after just changing his diet for ""Jobs"" so changing your calorie in take on such a drastic scale is bad for your health. Plus just because his caloric intake is high doesn't mean that he is out of shape. Manny Pacquiao for example eats twice that and weighs like 145. Of course he is burning it off and is probably an ectomorph it still stands that the amount of calories you put in your body is gonna change your weight, the changes especially at his mass need to be subtle and work at a shallow grade. Hope this kind of helps you understand, its a touchy concept especially with all the new weight loss things coming out its hard to know what actually works."
boogie2988,37dqd2,i_type_stuff,1 point,Wed May 27 17:53:22 2015 UTC,"sounds like you might have some weight issues as well haha. I'm not talking about anything drastic, 4.5k cal is way too much for someone who doesn't do anything active, just cutting to 4k (still 2k cal more then a regular person) would have lost him 50 pound in less then a year.   lets not get started with whether boogie is ""in shape"", you must be delusional if you think he has more then a few years left at his current health.  ""Juicing"" like jobs did is ridiculous. There is no magic ""weight loss thing"" to help you or anyone else that works better then eating less, and exercising a bit.  edit: corrected cal amount"

I started working out my Junior year of Highschool and have continued to do so til now im not super buff or anything but I can bench around 250 for a couple sets.   Thats not the point, Boogie is not in shape by any stretch of the imagination. I guess that must have come off in my post which wasn't intended. What I was saying is that just limiting your caloric intake isn't really the best way to do it. Your body will start to react to the change and begin clinging to the food and storing what it can get and also start craving fattier foods a lot more than it may have previously. And yes at his current weight he will probably not live to see 70, but that doesn't mean he wont, my dads good friend who is a big tech nerd is about to hit 80 and while unhealthy still seems to have quite a bit left in him, so you can never be too positive.   And Steve Jobs didn't juice he did a vegetarian diet call the Ornish diet or something like that. I don't know a ton about it but it is vegatarian, while juicing is in my opinion more of a supplement to good diet and exercise rather than a cure for it its a way to get a few more veggies in your body in a pretty good tasting way. Jobs did drink a massive amount of fruit juice off the shelves is what you are thinking of. Hope this clears up any confusion."

boogie2988,37ba6e,Lucretius_Black,9,Tue May 26 10:38:04 2015 UTC,"I didn't really know much about Tess' actual views about the issue first hand, only from what people say about her online so I decided to watch a few of her interviews.  After watching a few it becomes clear that while she promotes the idea of loving yourself like you do, she completely ignores the implications of being overweight to a persons health.  She promotes the idea that people should resign themselves to being unhealthy and that they shouldn't change it, which I feel is morally wrong. She claims that its just society pressuring people to fit into a mold based on how they look.  This is wrong for me at least and I'm sure others will agree that we want people to lose weight for their health.  Especially you Boogie, you bring a lot of joy to people through your videos, and it will be a great loss if you go to an early grave because of your weight.  TLDR: you and Tess both seem to agree that a person should love themself, but you do not advocate maintaining an unhealthy weight like she does."
boogie2988,37ba6e,nzbule,26,Tue May 26 16:05:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with Boogie's message but I think hes a little confused about exactly what Tess represents. I don't think its smart to compare himself to Tess because they really do have very different opinions on weight. Tess is an avid support for fat acceptance and the HAES movement. Boogie agrees both those things are bullshit and are harming people.   Boogie has never struck me as the SJW type, but when it comes to weight loss hes been on a slippery slope lately. Saying things like being obese is not a choice, comparing weight to race or sexual orientation, and now hes pretty much defending the biggest HAES supporter in social media.   I don't think by any means he should stop making these types of videos. I actually love these types of videos and early in the month i was asking for more of them and im happy to see the views getting so high. I just think Boogie needs to work on some parts of his argument.  For example, saying its not a choice to be fat is not a good argument. First of all it isn't true, and it takes personal responsibility away from the obese person. Also in this video he said people are getting fatter and no one knows why. Its pretty simple why people are getting obese, its because they eat too much and don't move enough and now for the first time in history, you have people telling them its not their fault and that they are just as healthy/beautiful as a thin person.   This isn't a good message to spread and you better believe people (especially the haters) are gonna call you out for it. People need to take personal responsibility for their weight, and when you say things like obese people should accept their size or that they are beautiful/healthy then you're indirectly enabling an unhealthy and destructive lifestyle."

Well, people get fat for different reasons.  And sometimes it isn't always the person's fault.  Yes, they are the ones ultimately putting the food into their body, but habits learned early in life tend to stick.  A lot of obese people were raised in poor families with cheap food.  Cheap food isn't healthy and is often packed with a ton of calories.  There was a study about parents thinking their kids weren't overweight when they actually are.  Parents do not realize the damage they are causing their kids.  Say a kid is overweight, gets made fun of at school cause hes overweight.  Mom tries to make him happy, and she tries to cheer him up with a treat or special meal.  It starts reinforcing an emotional attachment to food.  The mom doesn't mean to do harm, but shes making it harder and harder for that kid to get out of that downward spiral.   Personally I don't like focusing on who or what is responsible for people becoming fat.  I think attribution bias creeps in as its hard to understand everyone's situation."
boogie2988,37ba6e,HaberdasherA,3,Thu May 28 02:48:17 2015 UTC,"Everyone does get fat for the same reason. They eat too much food and dont exercise enough. Why they do that can be different, some of them are lazy, some of them are selfish, some of them just don't give a shit, and as you mentioned some of them are kids who are fed garbage by their shitty parents.   If you're talking about kids here than yeah I agree its the parent's fault. But in my comment I was talking about adults. Part of being an adult is taking responsibility and owning up to your behavior. Talking about how your mom bought you a lot of Mcdonalds as a kid is just an excuse. Obese adults have no one to blame but themselves but taking personal responsibility for their actions if very difficult for most of them."

boogie2988,37ba6e,padrino257,0,Wed May 27 02:53:43 2015 UTC,"I agree with your comment 100%. It's sad that this has to be stated, but you simply have the common sense that people on both sides of this discussion lack.   Of course if you are severely overweight, it is bad for you. You are likely to die earlier because of it. You are likely to become very sick because of it. Most people will not find you as attractive as they would if you were a normal weight. That is just a reality and noone can expect to be told that they are healthy when they are not or not to be debated on it if they do state so themselves. Also, no one can expect that people will find you attractive - naturally this goes for everyone. Because of this, to me HAES and fat acceptance are ridiculous movements spearheaded by delusional people who do not want to face reality.   At the same time, there is no reason to hate on anyone because of their weight. You don't know that persons story: maybe they are overweight because they have a condition, either physical or mental that keeps them from practicing a lifestyle that would be healthier for them. Maybe they just don't have the right information and want to be educated - but nobody is going to listen if they are being called ""hambeast"" in the process. Fatpeoplehate and its shitlords are, for that reason, equally ridiculous to me.  Also, I think it is important to state that not everybody who is skinny lives a healthy lifestyle. I myself am - according to my BMI - very close to being underweight, yet I do not nearly get as much exercise as I should. I don't eat healthy foods as much as I should and I drink a lot of sodas. On the other side there are bodybuilders and fitness freaks that pump their bodies full of supplements that are potentially harmful whilst pushing their body to the limits in the gym, risking sometimes serious long term injuries.  I think that if everybody was just to focus on themselves for a little while and improve what they can the world would be a much better place. But it is much easier to point out the flaws in others that it is to face your own.  EDIT: Grammar"

It seems that there can be no healthy middle in this situation, can there? Most models starve themselves until they look like skeletons and then plus sized models eat whatever they please and are, to some degree, just as unhealthy as the ones starving themselves. Although I have the perspective of ""some college guy"", I think it would be awesome to see models who give the average American woman something to strive for, yet is possible to achieve in a healthy way. Make no mistake, like Boogie says, being fat is not healthy. Yes, you should love the body you have, but if you love the body you have then try and keep it as healthy as possible.  TL;DR - The world is fucked in the head and women have no realistic role models that give them a healthy goal to shoot for."""

Boogie is my favorite youtuber, and i really admire that hes making strides to change his ways. I cannot imagine what its like and all i can assume is that it cant be easy. However, people like Tess, who people ""idolize"" are in the wrong. Sure, you can be 250 lbs and happy with yourself. But to in fact try and argue that you can be healthy? Absolutely not. Boogie is at least trying to turn people away from being overweight and i respect him for that, HOWEVER i think that boogie needs to work a bit harder on himself. I know its hard but as /u/HaberdasherA said, hes been on a slippery slope.

boogie2988,37ba6e,boogierocks,-1,Wed May 27 01:14:21 2015 UTC,"If you compare Boogie's older videos to ones now you can see visible improvements. He's not losing weight fast, but that's the point. Slow weight loss is more permanent weight loss. Dropping 100lbs in one year is a DRASTIC change in such a short timespan. Beyond that and you may start running into complications, like excess skin being left since you're losing weight too fast for your body to absorb the extra skin (though beyond a certain point that may happen regardless; skin has its elastic limitations after all).  Boogie started losing weight after already being substantially overweight. By the time you're that far along, it takes a long time to even mentally prepare yourself for such an endeavor because you have to completely change the way your brain works and swim against a pretty major current to realign your idea of a healthy food intake and an actually healthy food intake.  I'm not trying to make excuses or anything; being fat is bad, and just about everyone can lose the weight with some discipline and exercise. Hell even I'm doing it now, I'm down 75lbs over the past 1-2 years. I wasn't as bad off as Boogie to start with but that's some progress, though I've got a ways to go.   I don't like what Tess does because I don't like the idea of glamorizing an objectively unhealthy lifestyle. I like what Boogie does because he doesn't glamorize it, but he tells people like you to fuck off because a ""just shut up and work out, fatty"" attitude has a worse impact on a fat person's life than anything Tess has ever done."

boogie2988,36ukjf,cherbert,1 point,Mon May 25 02:56:45 2015 UTC,"We are in an age of the clickbait style of news reporting and seeing you jump on the bandwagon and actually taking time out to make a video about the graphics of Witcher 3 was a bit disapointing. I have followed you for years and this video just looked and sounded like it was creeping into the realms of your typical click bait youtube news flash videos designed with nothing more than to get clicks.  You always said you weren't doing this for the money, although I accept you have to earn a living. However, what I expected from someone of your calibur was to look at the media attempting to create this click bait 'non-story' and choose to ignore it as you have the intelligence to see through what it is.  Let me quote Rock Paper Shotgun..  ""I guess at this point we have to address the graphics, and the ‘downgrade’. Look, another time, another game, I might agree, but if you look at The Witcher 3 and you see anything other than an amazing-looking game, get your eyes checked. Could it have looked better if all development had been focused on the PC? Sure, but to dismiss its graphics because of a few wall textures and fire shaders is – well, you’re that guy on TripAdvisor who gives the Taj Mahal 2 stars because there isn’t a convenient McDonalds nearby.  The game still makes great use of the PC and offers plenty to crank up and outshine the consoles, to say nothing of mods like ENB and supporting 4K. This game looks great. Let nobody tell you otherwise, and certainly not with a casual scribble of ‘no atmosphere’ on a screenshot. Bullshit does this game have no atmosphere, even if it is sunnier than expected.""  Don't sell out to this bullshit style of news reporting you seem to be adopting. If you are gonna make a video about it do it adlib by way of sharing your own intelligent opinion and not sounding like you have written a news report. This is not the boogie I signed up for.  Your time could have been better spent either playing this amazing game or doing a review of it. The developers didn't deserve this criticism from the media and certainly didn't deserve you jumping on the bandwagon and helping to spread it."

boogie2988,36h7gi,Nestieus,7,Tue May 19 21:13:26 2015 UTC,"As a passionate gamer who makes videos and streams to twitch, I can definitely say that there is a certain amount of criticism you get when you are just a bigger guy who plays games. At my heaviest I was 305 and my entire family grouped my obesity with my gaming habits and therefore made it seem like they had made a mistake when they bought me my first game. As Boogie said, at first glance it might seem that way. However when I had my bout with depression, gaming was the only thing that kept me alive. There were some times during highs school, especially in the summer, where my life literally had no purpose at that present moment. I had nothing going for me, I had excluded all of my friends from my life, and was ultimately a shut in.   Although it is most definitely not the best of games, Modern Warfare 3 was the Call of Duty game at the time, so I picked it up and began playing it. I would literally sit down and grind that game from 7am to 2am the next morning with friends from school just to keep my mind off of literally killing myself.   At the end of the day, gaming is a glorious thing. That is why I love it and want to pursue the gaming industry for a career. With that being said, for anyone reading this that thinks gamers are weaker, lazier people than the rest of society we are NOT. Today, I weigh 180 and am about to go for a run to make up for some Witcher 3 time last night ;) See you guys later."

It was understandable though since after that he went almost immediately on streaming Witcher 3 so i get that he is extremely busy :)! I would love if he could see the actual art work.

boogie2988,36gpqb,KerzenscheinShineOn,1 point,Tue May 19 12:41:44 2015 UTC,Just some notes  His dad was a Cole miner ( I think ) His mother was a teacher He has one ( or two ) brothers and one sister He also did the character pastor Jacobs but only a couple of times He also did the stereotypical fat guy character  On the 5/20/96 he ate a 72oz steak at big texan steak ranch and is in their hall of fame for doing so. Boogie's actual first video isn't on youtube and was filmed on a playstation 2 recorder. Ray William Johnson played a significant role early on in Boogie becoming noticed on you tube He's favorite video game character is pacman  That's all I can think off the top of my head.
boogie2988,36gp08,InvaderDoom,5,Tue May 19 06:40:33 2015 UTC,"I've been a fan since he posted his ""fat man eating french fries"" video, which was posted about 8 years ago. Its been a long road and I never expected the guy i subbed to with less than 20k subs to still be making videos almost a decade later, let alone have over 2 million subs.   Thats not to say its been perfect though. There have been good times and bad times being a boogie fan. Especially when it comes to the weight loss. I was always supportive of boogie's weight loss goals and i watched his boogiedown550 videos religiously. But after a few years I noticed some things that concerned me and I felt like I was being more of an enabler than a supporter.   However, when I decided to question boogie about his weight loss I was called an asshole and was told to shut up. This was very frustrating and caused so much stress for me as a boogie fan because on one hand I want boogie to be healthy and I want him to be held accountable because that has been shown to be what works, but then im called an asshole and made out to be some hater/troll. Then on the other hand if i continue to pretend everything is fine and be in my mind an ""enabler"" then i can't live with myself.   So its been really fucking tough these past few months being a boogie fan. I have tried just about everything, I've tried asking hardball questions only to get passive aggressive hints to shut the fuck up, I've tried speaking my mind and not sugar coating everything only to get called an asshole on twitter by boogie and threatened with physical violence by his twitter followers, and I've tried being an enabler which makes me feel like im betraying myself and boogie.   Regardless of whatever happens, I will always be a boogie fan. Its just really fucking stressful at times but for a youtuber this real its always worth it."

I love boogie and when 80+ thousand people watch a video it only takes a little effort to put it down or insert a live video overlay when recording or in post processing.  It doesn't feel like we are in his home watching him speak about all these interesting topics anymore, it feels more formal and distant which is not what boogie is about.   A lot of people watch boogies blog series because he really is an interesting person with a life very different yet so similar to our own. He lets us into his life as he tells his story to us which we all love. The green screen takes some of that away."
boogie2988,36cxul,IntelligentComment,2,Mon May 18 13:16:09 2015 UTC,"It is not easy for him to take it down; it is hard enough for him to walk. And the thing is, he records his video's at night while his wife is asleep, so she can't help him. Since he uses the green screen for Twitch and records his Youtube videos after streams; it's asking a lot for him to take it down by himself.   I personally don't mind it; but I understand where you are coming from. It feels more like he is talking to you from a studio than some dude in his room sharing his life, opinions, and ideas. It has a less personal touch to it; less authentic. Which is why I was wondering if he could use a picture of his room on the green screen.  Edit: Removed word."

These people just see a pic of you or something you tweet and that's all they choose to see. They just choose to see your weight and compare to make themselves feel superior.   Its a shame people have to feel like that instead of honestly trying to help someone. (Notice how these people value animals other other humans?) I don't know you I've never met you but from what I see in your vids you have lost weight. I know its hard but try not to let these assholes get to you.   Big or small people will love you just simply cause who you are today. Your Twitch stream and tweets make me laugh. So let's enjoy the time we have with people in our lives that matter!

boogie2988,36a7op,Metroidmenagerie,1 point,Mon May 18 11:34:39 2015 UTC,"Boogie have you ever considered hiring some sort of diet ""coach"" and barring any other food from entering your house? It seems like you are struggling with motivation on this particular issue and maybe that could help.   Your videos have been of freat use for me, particularly the ones about depression, loneliness and suicide, but it makes me feel sad to see you still struggling with all these health problems caused by your weight.  I'm a compulsive eater as well, used to eat pizza for 8 on my own in one sitting at night and then maybe sometimes throw up. If you binge eat carrots though for instance ( less than 200 calories per Ib and it still tastes prety sweet), it's not that much of a problem (50 pounds lost so far in my case) and after two weeks or so, very sugary stuff start repulsing you a little :) My method is therefore stuffing my face with carrots and water and see how much I want the ""treat"" 20 minutes after, I usually don't want it anymore.  Probably more unwanted advice, I'm sorry ...:( I just hope we keep you around and healthy for long as you are an amazing person."

I don't think most people understand what it means to be addicted to food, something you cannot live without.  It took me a long time to get to the point where I could start going down and it's a real, daily struggle that I don't always win. It's interesting how most people don't grasp the idea that some things are easy for certain people and hard for others."

boogie2988,36a7op,Geofferic,1 point,Mon May 18 17:41:03 2015 UTC,"Man those people in the videos, weight loss is a huge journey where you need to learn what your body needs.  Then start adjusting the diet and portion size over time, it took years to get big and it takes years to loose it and keep it off permanently, dieting is never a fix to the underlaying problem which is too much karb in vs out so those people gain it all back once they stop.  Currently working on my own weight,  gone from 297 pounds to 210 over the past 1.5 years, before that i had a year where i just worked on cutting all candy and unhealthy things from my diet. Over half of my weight loss was without excercising at all, it came from portion control and learning what a portion should look and consist of, only the past 3 months i have been excersing every other day."

You seem to be addicted to talking about your weight problems vs making a consistent effort. As long as you want to be a victim to whatever reason it is you overeat then overweight you shall remain. There have been worse off people who have done more to overcome. Stop talking, more doing. You aren't a special snowflake.   I do enjoy your videos and think you are a good hearted person. At some point though you have to accept your life, including the past, and move on --- forward. There is no magic diet, they all work. Pick one and stick to it."

I'd agree that this video doesn't highlight it that much but many of the videos that he mentions loosing weight it's about him and his diet plans.  From what I've picked up he's been loosing weight which for him has been a new thing in his life, I'm not sure at what rate but with his condition only his doctor knows what's a safe rate.  as long as he's loosing weight I'm happy for him and hope to see videos in the future come out based on his new capability from weight loss."

I think it's a delicate topic, I've stepped in to help a few addicts in my life ( I consider morbidly obese people who eat junk food,  addicts the same way there can be coke, booze and cigarette addicts, it's a physical way of dealing with mental discomfort that becomes an habit and you forget about why you did it in the first place at some point, to focus on the habit itself - I was there at some point too with several of these stuff)  but most will hold a grudge against you if you do so sometimes you're better off leaving them at what they do even if it's destroying them :("

You imply that because I have no experience with large men, that the things I write are rubbish? The lack of experience was solely meant for the metabolism. And if you had any idea about the topic, then you would know that figuring out your metabolism is ALWAYS very difficult. That's why I told him to see a doctor. Noone on earth can tell you your metabolism over the internet.  And why would I need to draw attention on me on a subreddit with 4000 follower? If I'd need attention I'd post cat pics in r/aww.   Listen, all I wanted to do is help. I have the knowledge, so why wouldn't I share my thoughts to a person that needs help? I don't want money for my advices, I don't even want upvotes.

boogie2988,36da9n,malone_m,-1,Mon May 18 20:16:31 2015 UTC,"It is nowhere near that simple. Your also not including the exercise that is needed and the quality of the food is EXTREMELY important.    Boogie has talked to MANY doctors and professionals about this and knows a lot about it. He has talked extensively about this topic in other videos and on his Twitch streams.   Also, as DarthBraindrain said; drop the condescending attitude, especially on something you clearly know nothing about. I get that you're trying to help, but you went about it completely the wrong way. You're doing more damage than good."
boogie2988,36da9n,Doets,0,Mon May 18 14:39:13 2015 UTC,"It is simple. The hard part is to actually keep going. But the concept of losing weight is simple.  It doesn't matter what exercise he does. He can do whatever he wants. Important is that he moves (in a way that doesn't harm his joints). And the quality of food doesn't play a role at all. You could eat Mc Donald's all day and still lose weight if you keep the calories you eat below what your body burns. What you eat only plays a role in how hungry you'll be for the day. You could eat a chocolate bar and be hungry 10 minutes after that or you could eat the same amount of calories in wholemeal pasta and be less hungry.  I expected him to talk to many doctors, that's why I said in my PS ""Normally I'd expect you to know these things"", but nevertheless he seemed a bit helpless. I mean if he starts to eat fruits instead of meals out of nowhere I don't think that he knows that much about dieting.  I clearly know nothing about? Prove me wrong in one point, lol."
boogie2988,36da9n,malone_m,0,Mon May 18 15:06:35 2015 UTC,"But he can't move that much; his body weighs so much that it is literally crushing his bones. He is in a huge amount of pain and since he doesn't have good pain medicine(only over the counter); it is extremely hard for him to move. Because of this, he does not burn that many calories so he has to eat on a minimal calorie diet. And yes, the quality does matter, McDonald's food does not hold that many nutrients(that is why bodybuilders don't eat it as their muscles wouldn't develop properly) and contains a lot of fat. Boogie can't move much so he doesn't burn that many calories, so eating food that has a lot of calories in it doesn't make any sense. Fruits have a lot of nutrients and little to no fat, that is why eating them on a diet makes sense.   You are also not factoring in his mental disorders. When you have PTSD, Major Depressive Disorder, and an Anxiety disorder, achieving what he is trying to do at his age is an enormously difficult task.   That is what I meant when I said you know nothing about it; I was not talking about your knowledge of how to properly diet, but how little knowledge you have on his specific situation. This is a complicated situation with many nuances, you can't just use a broad stroke to fix it. And the way you talk down at him is condescending and makes your point come across as an insult rather than advice. You already admitted you know nothing about large men; further proving my point about you knowing nothing about this specific topic. Sometimes the best way to help, is to not say anything at all."
boogie2988,36da9n,Doets,3,Mon May 18 15:35:46 2015 UTC,"But he can't move that much; his body weighs so much that it is literally crushing his bones   You can put the bike on a table and make it work with your arms, you can use light dumbells to get a cardio workout or an elastiband if you don't want to use your lower body. Hiring a personal trainer/physical therapist is within his means if he wanted to do that Also, swimming is great for obese people since it does not put as much strain on the joints as running . Since he has so much weight to move around he could definitely use stronger muscles and you don't have to be standing necessarily to get that, that would improve his pain tremendously. When you have no muscles, your bones are doing the heavy lifting and you're gonna get arthritis from that, as he has . There are plenty of exercises you can do even on a mattress, you just have to want to do it.  It's not that he can't work out, it's just that it's not his priority at this point, and that's fine if he is fine with it too.  You can't force people to change, but you don't have to make up excuses for them either. My 83yo grandma is riddled with arthritis, her health is deteriorating fast but still she started physical therapy a few months ago and her mobility is improving slowly .  He's not going to be the greatest athlete at this point but he is not obese because he CAN'T work out, he is not that interested in it, that's it. If a Youtube coach could take charge of it, it would be so amazing to watch as Boogie is one of the 2 youtubers  I watch on a daily basis, I really really like him but it makes me sad to see him getting older and struggling with his health when most of his problems are manageable.."

boogie2988,36da9n,Doets,2,Mon May 18 18:49:01 2015 UTC,"he does not burn that many calories so he has to eat a minimal calorie diet   You are incorrect about this. A man of his size will burn far more calories than the average person just going about his day to day life, making no effort to engage in any formal kind of exercise. I guarantee if he ate 2500 calories a day (the average to sustain an average person) then the weight would drop off him."
boogie2988,36da9n,Doets,1 point,Mon May 18 23:45:38 2015 UTC,Could you explain this to me? If that is how it worked then why don't overweight people just eat a certain amount of calories and do nothing more than what they normally would? Isn't that why they're overweight in the first place?  I'm pretty sure I'm confused on what you meant.

boogie2988,34tg6l,B_SWI,12,Mon May 4 12:38:00 2015 UTC,"Boogie has said himself that he uses Francis as the ""voice of the internet."" I think as soon as I started hearing him say this they have declined vastly in quality because it feels like it is completely without passion. What I mean to say is, before we got into the full Francis meta, when he didn't always wear the ""francis"" shirt, it was often very well put together stuff that also came from a sense of familiarity - raging about Diablo, Starcraft 2 servers being down on the same day as the rest of the Blizzard servers, they all came from a sense of familiarity and frustration that mounted and then exploded instead of turning into a yelling contest 30 seconds in.  Now, it seems like Boogie takes whatever controversy is hot on the internet and just yells for 3 minutes. Nowadays I honestly turn off the Francis videos after a minute in, sometimes I don't even click them anymore because you know what the format for the ""new way"" is before you even click the video. When Francis makes Thanksgiving dinner by himself? You almost know its quality because passion and effort is put into it. When it's a ""hot issue"" on Reddit and something that Boogie probably hasn't even played/directly done? You know its probably going to be a little bit ass.   The reason that older Francis videos have millions of views is because they didn't come almost every week sometimes, because they came from good writing and passion and weren't just empty yelling as a mouthpiece. Francis has always been ""the big guns"" of the channel and now any video gets the same hits as any of the vlogging videos.   Boogie, you read this stuff and I love you, but don't take the average views as a means to phase out or retire Francis - take it as an indicator that the quality and effort needs to be improved. You're a smart and funny guy with an ear for the comedic, and if you wrote a proper monthly Francis skit that you made up yourself (Thanksgiving Dinner, Furby, etc) or from games you're playing and are truly frustrated by instead of using him as a hollow and uninspired rage video I'm sure you could get multimillion views per Francis video again.  And while you're at it, bring back Jesse dammit :P I've been with you from near the beginning and your delivery and story of the boy with the squirrel as a penis is one of the funniest things I've ever heard, with the Twilight one ranking up there as well."
boogie2988,34tg6l,OakwoodBunny,3,Mon May 4 13:40:38 2015 UTC,"Oh my word, this is spot on. As another long time fan who has seen Boogie become better and better, I'll be disappointed if he retires Francis as a character. You hit the nail on the head. Francis is an amazing character, the new format is just not as good as the older ones. Some more skits and Francis will reign supreme again. /u/uberwolf0 we believe in you :D"
boogie2988,34tg6l,PromisedPrince694,2,Mon May 4 21:33:30 2015 UTC,Pretty much my thoughts as well.
boogie2988,34tg6l,Tyrrexel,6,Mon May 4 14:19:22 2015 UTC,"I've never personally been a fan of the Francis content, I just don't go for the style of character or show.  Boogies newer audience that aren't as familiar with the character as old subs may not relate as well to those who have been around longer due to the loud and obnoxious nature of the sketches. Before boogie makes changes or draws conclusions I'd say there are probably a lot of small factors and the correlation won't show the underlying causation.   I tend to enjoy his rambling vlogs a lot too. I think boogie will do what he thinks is best to do, whether scaling back the Francis character for special occasions or more regularly on different topics."
boogie2988,34tg6l,Beer_is_good_for_you,3,Mon May 4 13:34:52 2015 UTC,"I think using francis for more thought out sketches is the best way forward, but what do I know. Hoepfully boogie will at the very least appreciate constructive feedback."
boogie2988,34tg6l,no_prehensilizing,4,Mon May 4 14:23:46 2015 UTC,"I also completely agree regarding the Francis videos. They're always a knee-jerk reaction to something that is happening in the gaming world now, and less about scripted skits, which is why I reckon they're getting old, fast. I've also been subbed for years (think I joined around 16,000 subs), and whilst I used to watch every Boogie video, I tend to skip some of them now, because I know they weren't really made with me in mind. I mostly just watch the rambling videos now.  On the constructive side, I like what Boogie has done with the green screen and his setup, he has obviously listened and invested in some much better hardware. Hopefully soon a better camera will follow. I think that instead of just making knee-jerk videos about gaming news as soon as it happens, Boogie should start doing a regular weekly show like he used to do We Game. He should have a set slot for news, and a set time for his own thoughts and opinions on subjects that are important to him that week. Pretty much the only reason I stopped watching all his gaming content was because I thought it lost quality massively last year. The whole ranty GamerGate and DRM situation. He regularly just - as you say - jumps on the bandwagon and repeats what we already know, or what he has said many, many times in older videos.  To summarize, I personally would like to see:   Try to get involved with the likes of Major Nelson and the PS4 team again, and do some E3 special We Game episodes, perhaps with special guests like AngryJoe (though he'll be busy) or other personalities giving their thoughts on a live stream panel as it happens. Even if it's just you and a few buddies sharing your live reactions - people love that. Less amiibo unboxings and more general gaming unboxings, from PC to Xbox, Wii U to 3DS. I like the few gaming related unboxings he has done. More VLOG content. Less preachy repetitious videos about DRM and GamerGate style issues - save them for a weekly or bi-weekly show like ""We Game"" . Take inspiration from AngryJoe and other YouTubers and the way that they format their videos. Why not do some reviews? I'm sure you could get review copies of any game you want, given your status. Take Francis and any other characters skits back to being more meaningful, and not just another way to cover current issues - because that makes the characters and that video irrelevant when the news story blows over. An example will be that the Francis ""where's my mountain dew"" being more enduring and popular than a rage video about DRM. The only time I would say Francis was used to good effect in a topical rage video was the ""Error 37"" video, which was hilarious.   Anyway, take my thoughts with a pinch of salt, because I'm only one guy, and I'll keep supporting Boogie whatever. I just hope he gets through this slightly rough patch in content."
boogie2988,34tg6l,dndjunkie,3,Mon May 4 13:38:02 2015 UTC,"I personally don't want game reviews- those take a lot of time which could be spent on better francis content. Plus, his channel isn't a review channel.   I do however agree with ""Take Francis and any other characters skits back to being more meaningful, and not just another way to cover current issues - because that makes the characters and that video irrelevant when the news story blows over.

boogie2988,34tg6l,norway_is_awesome,4,Mon May 4 14:22:27 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you're saying.  The more recent Francis videos have consistently been about some particular issue with gaming or the internet and have become pretty formulaic.  Francis is a great character but I feel Boogie's been pigeonholing him a bit.  I generally enjoy the ""skit"" videos more, but the Francis rage videos are the ones that have went viral and led to his breakout success, so I see why he would feel compelled to produce more of them."
boogie2988,34tg6l,Geofferic,4,Mon May 4 14:45:59 2015 UTC,"Let me start by saying that I love Boogie and feel that he deserves all of the success that has come his way. However, lately the only videos of his I watch, are his vlogging videos as I feel the amount of success that he's had has made him fear losing it so much that he's changed the way he does his job.   The biggest problem that I have with his ""Gaming news"" etc is that I feel like I am constantly being sold something. I feel that once Boogie became successful, he stopped being critical of game devs and their bullshit. Now I understand it doesn't make fiscal sense to bite the hand that feeds you....but I think what it came down to was, the developers can feed him much better than we his ""Youtube family"" can and made the choice to use Francis whenever a company makes a bad decision.So that if a developer gets angry with a Francis video, he can claim that it's all in jest, and that it was only Francis that feels that way...not Boogie.   It just made Francis lose all appeal to me because in my opinion it's so painfully obvious that he's only using the character to ""safely"" critique' devs and producers. While in his other videos he plays the apologist, and shills for Microsoft,Nintendo and Sony.   Just my two cents, I still love Boogie but I think that he's not being as honest with his audience as he claims to be. He's playing politics, and while I understand it, that doesn't mean that I have to like it."
boogie2988,34tg6l,OakwoodBunny,2,Mon May 4 19:30:19 2015 UTC,"I agree about the shift in context for Francis videos.

boogie2988,34tg6l,EiW1N,2,Mon May 4 15:30:24 2015 UTC,"The thing is, if you watch all of his videos you will start to notice a pattern where when he mentions that a new Francis video will likely be done, he very often is referring to the issue or ""controversy"" within the context of ""people are upset"" rather than saying specifically that he is upset via personal experience. Now, in numerous cases he does add personal experience with a qualification from a rambling video later or before, but many more times it is shown as a reaction to everyone else's reaction or at the very least comes across as such - which is why others in the thread are also speaking about the more formulaic aspect of the majority of new Francis videos."

However, I do disagree that Valve redacted the paid mods model solely because they thought it wouldn't be profitable enough and ""if enough people bought the mods, it didn't matter how much we complained, they'd still be offering it."" While profitability was undoubtedly and obviously part of the equation, I think the speed at which they reversed course shows that they do also care about their user base and are willing to weigh that against potential profits (immediate profits, anyways - there's definitely an argument to be made that appeasing the user base could just be a way to ensure long-term profitability). I think this whole thing is definitely going to be a factor in how they try to implement anything resembling a paid mod system in the future and as a result we will see more incentives for content creators rather than developers taking an overly large slice of the pie. It was nice to hear a company of that size and influence admit that they fucked up, and although I can't argue against the people who are still skeptical of Valve, in my opinion they should be getting more credit than they're currently receiving. It definitely makes for an interesting dichotomy moving forward, and I look forward to Boogie's perspective on any future developments. Keep up the good work, Boogie!"

boogie2988,33ntmj,dndjunkie,1 point,Mon Apr 27 21:52:19 2015 UTC,So someone who works on something that adds new missions/lands to a game like Skyrim should never be compensated for it?

boogie2988,33ntmj,Robord,1 point,Fri Apr 24 10:02:05 2015 UTC,True. Doesn't help steam takes 75% of the sales though :/
boogie2988,33ntmj,dndjunkie,1 point,Fri Apr 24 16:23:02 2015 UTC,"Just like Youtube and Twitch. Content creators get a fraction of the ad revenue that they generate for those platforms...yet without them where would streamers/lets players be?  Steam is the best platform out there and is a trusted vendor that vets the mods to weed out anything malicious and ensure quality content.They just removed a mod for stealing from someone else's code without permission....and that's on the first day...I'm not sure how much more proof of concept one would need. They are obviously on top of this, and will be making damn sure those who made the mod are compensated fairly.   Remember that Steam's best games are free to play, as are many of their other services/programs. They have to make their money somehow, and at least in this instance the public can share in that profit. Also, this goes to further the modder's possible career in the industry by having some actual sales numbers under their belts."
boogie2988,33ntmj,Robord,1 point,Fri Apr 24 20:17:26 2015 UTC,"I don't mind the idea of supporting dedicated modders, but Valve seriously stumbled in their implementation. The very mod used to promote this (the Skyrim fishing one) was taken down because the modder had taken assets from another, free mod (someone's idle animations); the modder was apparently under a strict NDA with Valve who had told him that it's okay to rip assets from free mods.   If I'm going to pay for a mod, I would expect the bare minimum of consumer protections:  -Guaranteed mod support with ample notice of discontinuation -Fair compensation (25% is an insultingly low cut for the people doing the mod work) -Regulation of and protection against shovelware ""asset"" mods, stolen assets, etc.  Right now, Valve has shown no indication that they care whatsoever about the modders, or even the customers with this. They just want that 75% cut."

They removed the mod on day 1...I really don't see any way that they could have removed it faster.
boogie2988,33ntmj,Robord,1 point,Fri Apr 24 20:25:31 2015 UTC,"Here's the /r/Games thread on it. Granted the most direct evidence available is the fishing mod creator's post about it, so there's always a chance he's lying about it. However given the fact that the mod was still ultimately pulled, I'm more inclined to believe it."
boogie2988,33ntmj,dndjunkie,1 point,Fri Apr 24 20:57:18 2015 UTC,Given that it was pulled the moment a complaint was issued says that they are not colluding with anyone. It's much more likely that the NDA was about the pay program and not the person's specific mod.   *Regardless I do agree that 75% is a bit much for them to take...however I think all of that can and will be adjusted in time.
boogie2988,33ntmj,Robord,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:15:12 2015 UTC,"You've got a lot more confidence in Valve than I do at this point, honestly. I don't want to seem like a cynical dingus but after seeing how they still haven't implemented a functional refund system (even where legally required to do so), I just don't see them the same way anymore. Hell, even EA has them beat in some regards, such as their 24-hour no-questions-asked refund policy."
boogie2988,33ntmj,dndjunkie,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:20:50 2015 UTC,"I have much more confidence in Valve than I do in EA. I'm also willing to allow them a bit of time to actually implement the program before running into the streets screaming that the sky is falling.   I am also not trying to tout Valve as the be all end all of platforms/developers but I am instead simply responding to the hypocrisy of saying that modders are the devil for monetizing in the subreddit of someone who makes money commenting on what other people produce.   I love Boogie's videos, but I also acknowledge the fact that he and the other youtubers are in this to make money....and to say otherwise is disingenuous to say the least.From all of his videos you can see that Boogie knows this fact all too well.  Basically it comes down to this...you cannot bitch and moan about someone who actually codes something and spends hours crafting it while cheering others who do much less work, for much larger compensation."
boogie2988,33ntmj,dndjunkie,1 point,Fri Apr 24 22:01:39 2015 UTC,"Well like I said I don't really have an issue with modders making money. If they're going through the effort of creating assets for games, they should have every right to ask for compensation. For example, that ex-Maxis employee making building assets for Cities: Skylines has a Patreon to help support him making more, which is awesome. I'm just saying there needs to be a reasonable level of regulation/consumer protection.   Also I still believe that allowing modders to take content from free mods and sell them within their own paid mods is certainly not good for the modding scene at all. Not to mention that Valve has opened a whole new can of worms when it comes to the DMCA.  Overall I just feel like, while a paid mod scene within Steam is a good idea, their initial implementation has fallen flat on its face. There was clearly not enough R&D on this. When their first line of defense against complaints is ""take it up with the modders,"" while at the same time taking that 75% cut, they're clearly trying to have their cake and eat it too."
boogie2988,33ntmj,dndjunkie,-1,Fri Apr 24 23:26:07 2015 UTC,"No, mods are supposed to be free. If these people wanted money, they should work on an actual game.  We're in the age of indie studios, it takes nothing to use an engine and make something. If you are a modder you have all the resources you need to make a game.  Mods have been free for 20 years, you don't change that."

I only have an issue with micro transactions if they:   Give an unfair advantage to players in multiplayer games Day one DLC or stuff that could have easily been included at launch.   Those are the two instances where I will cry foul.   Stuff like DLC expansions 3 or 4 months down the road. Extra skins,  clothing, armor, cosmetic stuff, short cuts, and single player unlocks, I have no problems with it. I do understand that gaming is a business and money is required to make more games. I would rather a good gaming company make their money back and a little more so they can make some more fun games for us in the future.

Sure, it's an 'option,' but if that were the case just make it free. If I have to pay to unlock, odds are it will be made unfun to unlock to incentivize purchase.  If I'm throwing down 60 bucks I sure as hell don't want to pay more to use what Ive already purchased."

An example would be if smashbros gave the option to buy unlockable char, this doesn't give the buyer an unwanted advantage because if they had the motivation/time they could look online for an unlock walkthrough and play the game to unlock it as well."

If I pay for a game I do not want there to be an in game store unlocking what I already purchased for even more money  How to handle DLC: fallout 3. Expansions made post game. Hell divers.

boogie2988,2z9mcw,BilltheRed,1 point,Tue Mar 17 01:22:11 2015 UTC,"One thing I wanna point out about what boogie said about if he gained weight it might just be ""muscle weight"". thats not possible. The average person can only gain about 1lbs of muscle a month at most unless you're on steroids. its not possible at boogie's weight to have worked out enough to gain 1 pound of muscle but not lost 2 lbs of fat.   I just wanted to point this out because this is a common misconception i see a lot of overweight people make when they start working out a lot. they will gain a few pounds in a week and say ""oh it must be 3lbs of muscle"". no, not even if you're a natty pro body builder will you gain 3lbs of muscle in a week."
boogie2988,2z9mcw,HaberdasherA,6,Mon Mar 16 23:18:20 2015 UTC,"unfortunately my doctor disagrees with you entirely.  He has made it very obvious that there would be rapid weight gain when i started taking this new T supplement and not to worry as it would be gain from muscle.  He said that body fat percentage is so high and that my muscle percentage is so low that I should definately see shrinking in all areas of my body (which I am) and the scale to either stay the same or grow for the first couple of months, if not longer.  No offense to you but I'm going to believe my endocrinologist over you. <3"
boogie2988,2z9mcw,uberwolf0,2,Tue Mar 17 07:33:30 2015 UTC,"Have you ever looked into Phentermine? I've lost 40+ lbs on it. Was 360'ish at my highest. May not be safe at your current weight but it may be something to consider as you get lower. It apparently has 'Phen' in it (from Fen-Phen), but not the 'Fen' that caused the heart issues. It does have a risk of increased blood pressure. But that can be monitored, or controlled with Clonidine if needed. I've only taken Clonidine for a short time once. Any medicine has a risk, but so does being overweight."
boogie2988,2z9mcw,bateller,1 point,Tue Mar 17 12:56:59 2015 UTC,"No offense taken. I don't know the details of the testosterone you're taking, but im assuming its working in a similar way to anabolic steroids which some body builders take. I think thats the only explanation for how you could be gaining a few pounds of muscle a week. Otherwise it isn't possible to gain muscle that quickly.   I just wanted to bring it up because its a common misconception i see a lot. People I know who are overweight will work out a few days a week for maybe 30min lifting weights then when they gain pounds that week they claim its muscle. I guess in your case its an exception because you're essential on a medical variant of anabolic steroids."

boogie2988,2z7kxf,GrindhouseMedia,6,Mon Mar 16 07:09:38 2015 UTC,"I think some people are just lacking the knowledge of how retail works.  I used to work at a retail store that sold primarily media. We had DVDs, Music CDs and Video Games. We had people at corporate in charge of maintaining our inventory. From time to time we would get a list of products that had to be ""zero'd out"". Basically it was products we were no longer going to carry or that were being recalled by the manufacturer. In order to remove the product from our store's inventory we had to ring the merchandise up and manually change the price to 1 penny. After we completed the list we would have to destroy the product and file away the receipt for our records.  The store takes the loss of profit and moves on. It was a way of keeping our inventory up to date.  If it was for example old magazines and we received the current issue, we had to ring up the older issues at a penny and then tear off the covers. The same applied to anything else we zero'd out. If we don't destroy the product, then it's basically stealing from the company. The product still holds value if it is not destroyed after completing the zero out process. It's the same as letting someone walk out of the store without paying for a product.  There is no conspiracy behind it. I don't know why people would lose their shit when dumpster diving and finding destroyed products. It's a normal procedure performed at most retail outlets. There is just no space in the store to keep EVERYTHING and stuff that doesn't sell isn't worth having around. The company calculates the loss and provides the employees with a list of the items. Simple as that."
boogie2988,2z7kxf,zewm426,3,Mon Mar 16 15:26:40 2015 UTC,"Basically it was products we were no longer going to carry or that were being recalled by the manufacture   I've also worked retail and there's a few reasons you're missing as well. We would throw stuff out and if we didn't destroy it people would dumpster dive and then try to return it for full retail value.   Also there were some items that weren't making the company money and had little to no physical value. A game disc is a perfect example it costs 5 cents for a game to be printed. It would cost far too much to ship all those games (think Madden 05 for PS2) to a warehouse and sell them off to a liquidating company (think Big Lots or Odd Lots) who would pay a few hundred dollars per ton for the games. That's fractions of a penny per game resale value when it costs let's say 3 cents per game to ship to the warehouse then another 3 cents to ship to the liquidating company. So it's far easier to destroy the games.   Donating the games has the same issue as reselling in the transportation costs far outweigh any benefit. It would be cheaper to donate money straight out instead of games.   Liability is also a possible issue. I'm a cook by trade now and we throw out at least 100lbs of food a night. We could donate all of that food but we would need a whole entire walk-in cooler for donated food, liability issues and the labor costs to manage that food for donations is prohibitive. Once again it's easier to give money straight up."

It also discouraged dumpster diving which is always a bonus. Im fairly certain gamestop had similar intentions.  TLDR: Give credit where credit is due, both good and bad."

boogie2988,2yjmce,theprettychillguy,2,Tue Mar 10 10:28:34 2015 UTC,"I'm a VR developer, and have made some quite successful games, perhaps I can help shed some light.  VR content NEEDS to be made specifically for VR. I wouldn't worry about content being 'compatible' or 'required' because you cant simply take a normal gaming experience and slap VR into it. This is the same reason why content on the PS4 won't be a problem, because you're not just going to be taking AAA PS4 titles and popping a VR mod onto them to make them run morpheus, you will be playing titles specifically made for VR with very high performance so as to run at high FPS.  What does this mean for you? Its fantastic for PC users, we will get tons of content, be able to run very high graphics games (possibly even things like GTA V) in VR, and can take advantage of the modding community to make lots of games compatible. For PS4, this means a much smaller pool of games to choose from, and perhaps not the experiences the average gamer is expecting from their VR device.  I can guaruntee you its not a fad, if you've not tried it for yourself its almost impossible to comment on it. You, are, there, not just a puzzle piece in a game, its an entirely different way of experiencing video games (and other applications) that is unlike anything you have tried before. Don't jump the gun on judging experiences and headsets either: modern displays and games have had YEARS to get to where they are now, and VR tech needs the same room for error and growth. Judging them early in development leads to incorrect information, incorrect impressions and slows down the VR whole movement."

What Steam needs to do is be very aggressive with this.  They have a chance at leading the market and making serious money.    Other than price point, my only concern is support.  If VR games don't come out for these headsets then those of us spending $300+ to get one will be very screwed and this is where I am hoping Steam rises to the call.  While Morpheus is a competitor, it being PS4 exclusive does ruin its chances at being competitive.  I hope it goes the way of the Kinect and gets a PC driver built for it.  I also feel like there has been a severe lack of hype for this technology.  This might be due to people not trying it out and being skeptical.  Or maybe they think it is another 3D TV fad.  But as long as VR devs and game devs take VR seriously, we could be on the edge of a gaming renaissance."

boogie2988,2ygnho,chriswhateverm,11,Mon Mar 9 17:42:34 2015 UTC,"This is, of course, one of the reasons I rebelled against the whole ""gamers are dead"" thing to begin with.  Ultimately I know that what leigh alexander was saying wasn't the worst thing in the world to say;  that hardcore gamers no longer have to be your demographic and that all of the piss and vinegar that comes along with hardcore gamers doesn't have to be part of the industry.  What I felt was inflammatory about that is to imply that hardcore gamers are somehow bad people.  I still do not believe this to this day.  When I was a kid, gamers were nerds and geeks.  Later gamers were children.  As a young adult gamers were violent murders.  Now with the current press we're recieving we're a combination of them all.  Neckbeard woman hating violent misogynists who either act like children or are in fact still children.  Worse yet the way gamers have been portrayed in the media, combined with the horrific actions of some gamergators (and people pretending to be gators), mainstream media has had more than enough cause to report this to a global scale.  This is the exact thing I fought.  This is the exact thing I rebelled against when those first 'gamers are dead' articles showed up.  My byline of saying ""hey some gamergaters are shit but their points aren't all that bad."" is what got me banned from neogaf.  its what got me told off in private by some people in the industry.  its what got me blacklisted from some of my favorite events.  its fucked.  So yeah, this is part of having the thing I fought for years shoved back.  This is part of that stigma and that bullshit I fought my entire life being lumped back on our shoylders tenfold.  Maybe we even deserve it for  'gamers' choosing to report it  this way and other 'gamers' choosing to act like insane fucking people, driving women out of their goddamned homes.  Those who are scared of not seeming PC will be afraid to treat gaming the way I think it deserves to be treated;  like works of art.  Those who choose to still treat it seriously will likely be mocked for being man-children and nerds and geeks and whatever.  We'll just have to work harder, to be better, to be more inclusive and more mature, and hope that in time we can work past this stigma once again.  In the meantime, gaming archives are fucked and that's our own fault.  I hope someone out there outside of academia is choosing to do this privately.  I hope we can find someone."
boogie2988,2ygnho,uberwolf0,4,Tue Mar 10 03:48:11 2015 UTC,"Ultimately I know that what leigh alexander was saying wasn't the worst thing in the world to say   That wasn't what she said at all, here I'll quote a few relevant bits:   ‘Game culture’ as we know it is kind of embarrassing -- it’s not even culture.  It’s young men queuing with plush mushroom hats and backpacks and jutting promo poster rolls.   They don’t know how to dress or behave.   ‘Games culture’ is a petri dish of people who know so little about how human social interaction and professional life works  those junkies with the touchscreen candies  people who are okay with an infantilized cultural desert of shitty behavior  a generation of lonely basement kids had marketers whispering in their ears that they were the most important commercial demographic of all time  It makes a strange sort of sense that video games of that time would become scapegoats for moral panic, for atrocities committed by young white teen boys in hypercapitalist America  Gamers are over. That’s why they’re so mad.   These obtuse shitslingers, these wailing hyper-consumers, these childish internet-arguers   You should also read some of the replies by ""industry professionals"" to her article on there, since quite a few of them are enlightening: https://archive.today/Gl24Q  But can you point out which part of that was particularly insightful, thought out or not full of invective and generalisations against said audience? Do you think this is how professional writers for a multi-billion dollar worldwide industry should behave and present themselves?  It's never a very clever thing to attack the audience you are writing for or the majority consumers of the industry you are working in, no matter who you are: http://imgur.com/a/VUHxA  But taken in context with the greater dealings she was involved in, it makes it rather clear how the article was meant. For instance she also left this Vine after posting said article: https://vine.co/v/Ml2luXWI0OZ   This is from her site, writing how she sees ""nerds"": http://leighalexander.net/faq/   Self-identified nerds are often so obsessed with their identity as cultural outcasts that they are willfully blind to their privilege, and for the sake of relatively-absurd fandoms — space marines, dragons, zombies, endless war simulations — take their myopic and insular attitudes to “art” and “culture” with tunnel-visioned, inflexible, embarrassing seriousness that often leads to homogeneity, racism, sexism and bullying.   Leigh Alexander was also the one that celebrated Jack Thompson having a heart attack and told people to send him ""poisoned candy"": http://www.destructoid.com/karma-s-a-bitch-jack-thompson-has-heart-trouble-37456.phtml  Or her passive-aggressive ""review"" of GTA V http://leighalexander.net/review-of-gta-v/   Instead of only playing as one gross man who commits crimes and swears a lot, you get to play as three different ones. My press kit says this is a narrative innovation. You can’t be a woman. I could be lazy and say this is because women do not commit crimes or swear and nor should they want to, but instead I’m going to come right out and say it’s misogynistic. What, you want to leave me death threats? Go for it! Games are about feeling powerful, and about you getting your way!   I think that generalising and insulting an audience of millions like she did isn't particularly conducive to harmony or a great and happy industry where GAMES ARE FOR EVERYONE. stands as a truth. This wasn't true and a generalisation even through the 80s: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4KG9ib8S4 when video games were small, and it isn't any more true now that many are adults.    all of the piss and vinegar that comes along with hardcore gamers doesn't have to be part of the industry.   Because, presumably ""casual"" gamers would be different? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIwBPR00grc and alienating core gamers will improve and grow ""the industry"", somehow?   combined with the horrific actions of some gamergators   Which would those be?   what got me banned from neogaf. its what got me told off in private by some people in the industry. its what got me blacklisted from some of my favorite events. its fucked.   I'm sorry this happened to you, and this is mainly what we are trying to fight, it's somewhat understandable that the people seeing themselves as the ones with the keys to the castle would react in this way. But before you believe the media narrative about ""gamergators"" remind yourself of all the things that they called you or have said about you and ask yourself if they would do that to you, why wouldn't they ""massage"" the truth otherwise? For instance:   other 'gamers' choosing to act like insane fucking people, driving women out of their goddamned homes.   Could you explain what you mean by this?   In the meantime, gaming archives are fucked and that's our own fault.   Again, could you explain?  http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/Collection/NewMedia/NationalVideogameArchive.aspx  http://blogs.loc.gov/digitalpreservation/2012/09/yes-the-library-of-congress-has-video-games-an-interview-with-david-gibson/  How does a Tumblr post by a heavily biased individual point you to taking this stance or thinking of it as a factual presentation of what is supposedly ""happening""?"
boogie2988,2ygnho,tinkertoy78,2,Tue Mar 10 14:27:42 2015 UTC,"In the meantime, gaming archives are fucked and that's our own fault. I hope someone out there outside of academia is choosing to do this privately. I hope we can find someone.   http://www.lib.umich.edu/computer-video-game-archive  Video game archives aren't entirely a new thing but the issue is more that stuff from the pre-80's era- a lot of formative stuff when the bar for entry was crazy high and buying a computer was an $8,000 dollar purchase- is increasingly hard to find. At some level I have to ask if it is really necessary given that the technology really wasn't there just yet. Regardless, you don't need an academic institution to preserve these things. Every academic discipline started because someone was willing to be an amateur.   I wouldn't say its our fault either. The validity of an academic pursuit- the preservation of the past, regardless of medium is an academic pursuit- isn't bound to the whims of tone police.    So yeah, this is part of having the thing I fought for years shoved back. This is part of that stigma and that bullshit I fought my entire life being lumped back on our shoylders tenfold. Maybe we even deserve it for 'gamers' choosing to report it this way and other 'gamers' choosing to act like insane fucking people, driving women out of their goddamned homes.   I have no idea how you can be so patient with these people. I used to be pretty neutral but erring on the side of GamerGate because of the backlash GG was enduring over the issue yet these days I'm pretty squarely in the ring of GG. I see no reason not to just let the whole thing burn down, trigger a second video game crash, and see a billion dollar industry obliterated if it means these clowns go find something else to colonize. aGG won't concede a single point. Six months later they still think its about harassment. They won't concede that there is something to be said about ethics and journalism- they wield that exact phrase as an insult. They hold up people as victims of harassment when those same people were themselves heavily complicit in doxxing and harassment. Zoe Quinn? She used to be a member of helldump. She laughed at it when her PR agent doxxed someone. Leigh Alexander has an established history of hating the gaming community. Her blog used to think it was a problem that nerds, ""survived"" high school.   Which brings me to the main thrust of my problem. These people don't think high school ever ended. They don't understand that if they hem a community in and throw every name in the book at them that the only result that could happen is that when something breaks out of the pen, its ten times as vitriolic and ten times as fanatical as when it first got put in there. How do we go from having these people trying to call ZQ a victim when she was a member of a community that- so they claim- traumatized someone into committing suicide to having them call the gaming community worse than ISIS? How does that work?   These people are engaging in a strategy which can only make the problem persist and, if anything, get worse. They don't want our community, they just want the land we're standing on. They're colonists."
boogie2988,2ygnho,feroslav,1 point,Tue Mar 10 20:08:23 2015 UTC,"Gaming archives are not ""fucked"". This whole thing is being exagerated quite a lot. Not overly surprised given the context of it.  I do want to add that I feel for you Boogie, I am really sorry for the many things you and others who've taken a mostly neutral approach (saw peanutbuttergamer get a lot of hassle latlely too) had to endure from morons (anti or pro) online because you dared voice an opinion on gamergate. People who take a moderate stance on things often get hit from both sides of a conflict, simply because they pose a threat to all the extremes.  I'm pro-GG and I'm very much pro intellectualism. I find most on the GG side are tbh. Part of that though, is being skeptical of what you are told. Factchecking, sourcechecking etc.  (edit: the last part is more in reply to the user that commented on some pro-gg people being against academic research, sorry if that's a bit unclear). One of the most frustrating things in anything involving academic work on games and gamers, is how hard it is to find research and sourcematerial that aren't heavily biased, from boths ends of the spectrum."
boogie2988,2ygnho,feroslav,2,Tue Mar 10 13:44:43 2015 UTC,"You'd find that most on the ""pro-GG side"" aren't so much ""anti-intellectualism"", but anti-horseshit being passed off as ""intellectualism"", I recommend reading this thread on that for instance: http://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2yfknl/in_answer_to_tbs_recent_twitlonger_where_are_the/"
