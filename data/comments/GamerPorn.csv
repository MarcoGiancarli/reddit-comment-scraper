It seems like such wonderful car game, with unique graphical effects that would be so cool to see on PC (or xbox for those on it, also looking at Forza, MS). Hopefully other, platform neutral, games borrow some of these effects in the future."
GamerPorn,3du8ib,SirSteyr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:51:15 2015 UTC,I've been dying to get my hands on Forza Horizons 2 'cause that looks fantastic as well but it's only thing I want for the Xbox.  If anything gets borrowed from Driveclub I hope it's at least the photo mode because it is fantastic

GamerPorn,3b0xrb,34895348573857348759,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:35:58 2015 UTC,What about MW 2012?
GamerPorn,3b0xrb,Tyronto,2,Thu Jun 25 09:45:18 2015 UTC,MW 2012 wasn't up to the standards of older NFS games in my eyes. HP 2010 is the only recent one I can think of that really feels like a true Need for Speed game. All just my opinion though.
GamerPorn,3b0xrb,reddude7,2,Thu Jun 25 10:09:51 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Hot Pursuit actually ended up being a game I still go back to, even today. I loved it. Since then, I enjoyed the MW reboot and that's the most recent one in the series I bought, but it definitely didn't feel like NFS. I ended up putting it down pretty quickly and never completed it, and have only picked it up again once. Let's hope the new one will somewhat feel like NFS! But the drifting crap in the gameplay trailer makes me think not :/"
GamerPorn,3b0xrb,Zook024,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:57:31 2015 UTC,I take it you took these from taking a screenshot in game?
GamerPorn,3b0xrb,Zook024,2,Thu Jun 25 11:50:21 2015 UTC,"Basically the way it works is that when you pause the game there's a photo mode, where you can edit the photos and move the camera around and get the shots that I took. Now yes, I had to screenshot these because there's no way to actually save the images to the disk without screenshotting them. But these are all in game images!"
GamerPorn,3b0xrb,Zook024,2,Thu Jun 25 11:55:42 2015 UTC,"yeah I gotcha, reason I asked is 'cause I saw the button prompts on each one. I've taken a few myself here and while they cannot be accessed online anymore since EA shut off the Autolog service, the game still does save every dreamshot (and regular shots as well) to a folder on your hard drive when you snap them."
GamerPorn,3b0xrb,reddude7,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:00:46 2015 UTC,"Very nice shots! I went for generally more artsy shots (as you can see :P). And I didn't know they saved to the disk, although now that I've actually thought about it it makes sense, as it has to store them somewhere."

GamerPorn,3aj8qm,plausiblejosh,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:47:09 2015 UTC,"If you played the first ones on PC, then I'd recommend not getting it, unless you really love the series. It's not nearly as big of an overhaul on PC as it is on consoles. Unless it's real cheap, then I'd pass on the Redux versions."

And then just buy another battery for the price of what I paid to ship the damn laptop across the country.  I would never have bought it if I realized they sealed the battery in with the rest of the components. I can't even back up my hard drive without voiding the warranty at this point.

Does it hold up to what you remembered if you did play the original and do you feel it's the same or has it improved the game for you?"

And am very pleased that from what I can recall its exactly the same save the graphics of course. The original HW was such a great game! It was the first game I can remember that got me emotionally involved with the story through narration. I loved the original and the remastered seems to be so far, excellent and is just a graphical update. No re-imagining bull shit, just better graphics.

GamerPorn,2tv19o,errormaker,3,Tue Jan 27 21:16:52 2015 UTC,"30-40 fps at the start with 36 cars (Full roster) With this many cars the game is CPU bound. I'm also running everything on ultra, including some of the overkill settings, like reflections and particle density. Particle density set to high renders the water spray of 8 cars max, ultra renders the spray of all vehicles, so it's a pretty big hit of course.  Alone on the track with rain: 70-90fps.  Clear: 90-140 fps  SLI 970s, i7 3930k"
GamerPorn,2ttjvp,an0nym0usgamer,2,Tue Jan 27 07:46:25 2015 UTC,"Seriously surprised with how good this game looks at times, especially with how smooth it runs.  I've been running through the campaign on my computer at 4k solely for screenshots even through my framerate is highly variable and often unenjoyably slow but the fact that I'm holding at least 30fps quite often (and rarely 60, this is on a GTX 770) while delivering this level of fidelity is pretty amazing (most other games run like shit at 4k for me).

It was something like going to speak to this guy for a mission. I had to meet him at the top of these stars. Durring the monolog he had walked in front of the stair case so I had to stay there to listen to him. Once he was done and he sent me on my way, he was suppose to move and allow me to leave, instead he glitched out and stayed there. If Rage was a more open/free world I could've just jumped over the banister or something, but I remember that game had invisible walls EVERYWHERE.  Too bad."

GamerPorn,2qx2i9,CUDesu,1 point,Wed Dec 31 13:45:36 2014 UTC,Could you tell me how do I get the direct link to image? I'm sick of imgur's quality and don't know how to get the direct link from flickr.
GamerPorn,2qx2i9,ProtologolusX,2,Thu Jan 8 11:31:36 2015 UTC,"On Flickr, once you have uploaded an image. Click on the image in your photostream and then click the download icon on the bottom right followed by the ""View all sizes"" link as seen in the following image:  http://i.imgur.com/fHWpzLZ.png  Then click on the image size called 'original' and then (if using chrome) right click the image that loads and either copy image URL or open image in a new tab and copy the URL from there.  Hope that helps."
