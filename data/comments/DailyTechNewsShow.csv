The analysis shows that robotic surgery was related to 144 deaths between 2000 and 2013, but between 2007 and 2013 over 1.7 million robotic procedures were carried out.

Banning /r/fatpeoplehate while leaving /r/coontown in place was a poor decision; but banning any subreddit (including the child porn subs that started this slippery slope) may have been a mistake. Personally, I prefer criminals operating on the clear internet where police are able to launch investigations into crimes with relative ease."

This is no different than watching sports or anything else on TV for that matter. I have grown up with computer games and watching others - even on a Commodore 64 - can be as exciting as playing yourself and even better, if you watch someone that really know their stuff. But I know what you're saying, as I wouldn't really think it would become this big.   And I assure you -- as much as I really dislike video games generally, and don't understand the culture, or the seriousness people have about it, if I knew I could make $7mil doing it, I would have forced myself into it years ago.   It's not something everyone can do. Just like not everyone can be a movie star, football star or start a company like Apple or Microsoft. It's a matter of doing the right thing, at the right time. It's easy to say ""hell, I could have done that"" after the fact, but you didn't, because you didn't think that way at that time. I think a real important part of PweDiePie's success is that he did not start making videos for money - but for the fun of it - and that's why you did not start doing it. Combine that with the right time, where the tools are there: YouTube, cheap good cameras and microphones, easy to advertise, cheap broadband and so on. Also following a person on YouTube had started to become more of a thing.  Now, with the availability of easy to use tools, other people can do the same, but most, if not all, will not be as successful, because they will have to compete with all the others also trying to do what PeyDiePie did. Others are making a lot of money on similar schemes today, but they aren't making the same amount of money.  PewDiePie was lucky - he had the interest, the right product and did it at the right time."

DailyTechNewsShow,3cc0p8,motang,7,Mon Jul 6 19:04:38 2015 UTC,"As to be expected that was about as vague and PR speak as it gets. Mods are clearly still left with tons of questions about the specifics (one, two, three, four), while the concerns of regular users are not addressed at all (one, two, three, four, five, six, seven). Given the whole backstory I guess the counter on the petition will go up even further."
DailyTechNewsShow,3cc0p8,ZP1582,8,Mon Jul 6 21:22:04 2015 UTC,"This is even worse than saying nothing. There is so much obfuscation and spreading of blame going on that any apology that might have existed is disingenuous.    We screwed up.     Are you the CEO of the company, or just the PR schill? The last time I checked, the large salaries of corporate CEOs is defended because the CEO is the supposedly the public face of the company. So, is she the CEO or the PR manager? Shouldn't this be ""I screwed up.""? She can't even stand there and take the blame like a CEO is supposed to do?   Not just on July 2     What  happened on July 2nd? I know what happened on July 2nd, but what precisely did all of reddit screw up on July 2nd? Was it firing the person they fired? Was it the way in which they announced her firing? Was it the reason why she was fired? Was it the fact that they fired her and had on plan on how to deal with her absence? What are you apologizing for? And, how did all of reddit screw this up?   We have apologized and made promises to you...over many years.     And I am here to do it yet again. Why is this time different? Oh, it's not different? Then why are you here? Oh, that's right, can't make any empty promises about improved tools or improving communication without a good apology to lead into it.    Also, ""we""... who is ""we""? Everyone at reddit made the decision to fire Victoria? Everyone at reddit has wasted time on developing moderator tools? Really? No, no, I think what she means here is at everyone, except herself, and especially those that came before her screwed up and left her in a horrible position to have to deal with this 'mess'. ""We acknowledge this long history of mistakes."" In other words, ""It wasn't my fault; it's always been this way.""  Oh, and one contact person for all of reddit's moderators? Just one?  I mean, it shouldn't take a genius to figure out that you're going to need more than one contact person for a community of millions. But, you know, it's great that she's let us know they have absolutely no plan or direction from the outset. Just a vague, ""We'll try this out.""   I know these are just words, and it may be hard for you to believe us.     No, it's impossible for us to believe you. You haven't done anything yet. You have no social currency to back up this claim at all.   I and the team are committed to talking more often with the community, starting now.     What were they committed to before today?"
DailyTechNewsShow,3cc0p8,LegionVsNinja,2,Tue Jul 7 00:12:09 2015 UTC,"Alas ignoring users once the checks are cached seems to be going around in the software sector these days. Be it Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Mozilla, Spotify or Todoist, once they've found a way to get paid they all stop caring.  Hopefully this big public screw-up will force Reddit to improve in the short-term, but with blood in the water maybe some Wikipedia (user funded) or Aether (distributed) style competitor will pop-up that puts its development first again. Might be the perfect next thing for Bittorrent now that they have unveiled a instant messaging app along side their file sharing apps.  Now if only there was a way to get around all the annoying data siloing these software makers use to keep everyone trapped."

DailyTechNewsShow,3cc450,starfuryzeta,6,Mon Jul 6 19:27:52 2015 UTC,So chase the regular positive contributors from regularly contributing. Forcing them to find new ways to comment or contribute. And then expect them to drop those new habits in a few weeks? No the comments aren't coming back I would think. The trolls or negative feedback will be pounding on the doors and flood back in once they can.
DailyTechNewsShow,3cc450,AverageRandomJoe,3,Mon Jul 6 21:14:55 2015 UTC,"There are hardly ever ""positive contributors"" in a forum attached to a news site. In all the years I've been on the Internet, I've rarely...very very rarely...seen anything of substance in a comments section. It's mostly just crap.   I've said for years that they shouldn't ever have a comments section. If you want to comment, do the old ""letter to the editor"" or email the author. Or...comment on a site like Reddit, like we're doing here now. News sites like The Verge or Ars or wherever should just present their stories. Too often people scroll too far and WHAM, there's the comments spewing god-knows-what out there and it just taints everything. It's not even a question of ""just don't read them"" because 9 times out of 10 they're not hidden away from the rest of the story. So you have to play ""oh, don't scroll to far! Don't scroll down too far! NOOOO!"""
DailyTechNewsShow,3cc450,goofball_jones,2,Tue Jul 7 06:14:05 2015 UTC,"That was kinda my point. They claim there was a positive community and will be back after the haters chill. They aren't coming back (or stay very long if they do) because even if there was a positive community, they just sent them packing.  I would say that the comments are generally a combination of haters and circle jerks. Which makes sense, only people with strong feelings post and some positive and some negative. I mean that is the make up of Reddit for the most part, haters and circle jerks. Shutting down your comments doesn't get rid of the voices, just from your property, which is fine. They have an image to curate. I just hate the PR crap that they will bring the comments back later. Not happening."
DailyTechNewsShow,3cc450,AverageRandomJoe,2,Tue Jul 7 14:35:27 2015 UTC,Nobody in the high traffic blog world seems to be able to tame comments. The first sign they won't be back is the article spends half the time trying to convince you they will.

The series was produced and directed by Mick Jackson of the BBC Science and Features Department and first aired in 1978 (UK) and 1979 (USA). It took an interdisciplinary approach to the history of science and invention and demonstrated how various discoveries, scientific achievements, and historical world events were built from one another successively in an interconnected way to bring about particular aspects of modern technology. The series was noted for Burke's crisp and enthusiastic presentation (and dry humour), historical re-enactments, and intricate working models.

Usually, when a tragic incident like this happens, it turns out that the worker, or technician (who are more familiar with the workings of these things, but also more prone to recklessness) willingly bypassed the security sensors for whatever reason, and was either in the way of the machine's usual course, or activated a different sensor causing the thing to behave unexpectedly.
