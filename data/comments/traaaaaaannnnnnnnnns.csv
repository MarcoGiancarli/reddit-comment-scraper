If you don't like it, use that mouse pad and scroll on past it, you're perfectly capable of that if you were able to take the time to harass me for my choice of image."

Ok obviously i have to break this down barney style for you since your dumb ass doesn't understand a word I've said. Its a silly reddit post (not to be taken literally). Clearly, I don't expect someone to hand me 5 million dollars. The point of the caption is that life is tough, not just for me, but for everyone like me. Sometimes a silly picture that inspires a smile can make a person's day, and that is why i posted it. Much to your chagrin, some people do like minions and dispicable me. And the mere image alone can bring a smile to someone's face. The 5 million dollar bit is more or less the joke. It is so absurd that it adds a bit of humor to an otherwise uplifting statement. Apparently, in all that time you spent trying to break this down piece by piece, you missed the blatant fact that it is simply about wanting someone to just tell you ""everything's going to be okay."""

Is that some sort of massive outlier? Or is it because I already got everything lined up with my therapist?"
traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,39apsh,iamsammii,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:26:43 2015 UTC,"I think the standards of care suggest about 3 months before starting HRT.

I wonder how much different it would have been had the NP not referred me. shrugs"
traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,39apsh,Asterne,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:36:10 2015 UTC,"That's a shame.

I guess I got dealt a series of short straws when it comes to trans stuff, physically and socially, so I'm more prone to bitterness than most."
traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,39apsh,renadi,15,Wed Jun 10 16:10:54 2015 UTC,"And then we start hearing shit about ""You don't need to have experienced dysphoria to be trans!"" in this way that like...isn't wrong, but is ignoring the full story.

traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,39apsh,Wannabkate,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:32:02 2015 UTC,"It depends. I've seen all kinds. It's just interesting to watch the youngest generation of trans people, and see how some understand the privilege they've been given and some...well, clearly don't.  To be a bit more clear about what I was trying to say, it is 100% true that you don't need to experience genital/body dysphoria to be trans, regardless of availability of treatment or the actions of those around you. But social dysphoria is more of a function of how society treats you. To me, the simple definition of trans*, as in the umbrella term, is that our identity transgresses the gender binary in some way. Whether it's because we refused to stay on the side of society's binary and moved to the other side, or if it's because we refuse to sit on a specific location in that binary. Social dysphoria is a result of society refusing to respect our identity, through methods both more subtle and more directly forceful. If a trans person has never experienced social dysphoria at all, it's because they haven't experienced a prolonged, pervasive, and forceful denial of their identity. There's nothing wrong with that, but as with many positions of privilege, people need to be aware of it (and why it exists) and sometimes aren't. It's kind of crazy to think that we're living in an age where this sort of privilege can apply to a number of trans people, but it's definitely becoming a thing."

traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,39apsh,Hennydowntheroad,4,Wed Jun 10 21:41:12 2015 UTC,"Uhhhmmmm... why?    There's no point in being upset.  For a community that has been dragged through the mud for so long, and is only just beginning to try to climb out of the ditch, being angry with others, or jealous of others who are fortunate to have support is pretty pathetic and perfectly useless.  In fact, it just furthers the issues of trans people hating other trans people. Yeah, it sucks to be trans.  But it sucks for you and everyone else who is trans.    NOBODY WHO IS TRANS WILL EVER HAVE A PERFECTLY CIS LIFE.  Some people can start their genuine life earlier than others, and some NEVER live a moment of their genuine life.  So stop crying about it and acting with disdain toward other trans people.  It solves nothing, gets you nowhere, and makes the younger trans generation feel less accepted.  You are doing exactly what some older trans people do, and it's this kind of garbage that makes the trans community so hating inside the community itself."

traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,38gt7r,SeasideSunrise,17,Thu Jun 4 03:43:58 2015 UTC,I'm not a subscriber here because I don't really have a reason to be but clicked your profile after seeing the down vote brigade. /r/funny and most default subs are fucking idiotic about shit like this. You were ultra reasonable in saying that the word should be avoided and it really didn't resemble the shit in /r/TumblrInAction and other more outright ridiculous shit. You weren't telling people to not say water because you're a fire-kin and water triggers you! You were just trying to get a word used by bigots recognized as such. Sorry for the rant but hope people get a bit more respectful and try to be a little empathetic.
traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,38gt7r,Jacob_The_Duck,12,Thu Jun 4 04:33:40 2015 UTC,Wow...  Thank you for this.  It seriously means a lot. :-)

traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,386di2,cyfermax,4,Tue Jun 2 22:20:52 2015 UTC,"I know that feels. My parents both use male pronouns when referring to me. I'm pre hrt, but the least they could do is use gender neutral pronouns and they refuse. I even gave them my ultimatum yesterday where they could either accept this and be a part of my life or i can go away and they wont be at all. They're response... ""bottom line is, you're our son and we'll love you no matter what."" Fml, its like talking to a pair of potatoes."

And I was all ""Sure, dad, whatever."" I'm 30, you don't control me, and it's not about the surgery. He was pissed when he found out about HRT and I could only laugh."
