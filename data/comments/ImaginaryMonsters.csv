Even if you're too lazy to lazy to read the artist's explanations and background stories (like I am), the image already hints at a complex and believable world.

ImaginaryMonsters,3do2gq,CoffeeAndKarma,2,Sat Jul 18 05:45:20 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure clothes are more about shelter than shame. They keep stuff off of our bodies, which helps keep us clean, and they keep us warm if it's cold, etc."

ImaginaryMonsters,3do2gq,JayEsDy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:29:19 2015 UTC,This is actually kinda important.  It's not enough to just put some cloth on an alien creature; it needs to be able to take it off by itself like we do.  Although they do have hands so I can sorta see how.

ImaginaryMonsters,3d0jjk,Stone2Sand,10,Sun Jul 12 14:14:40 2015 UTC,The wings were too hard.
ImaginaryMonsters,3d0jjk,specliac,11,Sun Jul 12 14:19:21 2015 UTC,"They'd be a challenge.    Wings essentially have the same muscle structure as arms, but their pectoral muscles stick way out because they're anchored to a massive protruding sternum called a ""keel"".    Those muscles usually aren't drawn on dragons, partly because the second set of arms/legs in between the wings and the sternum are right where those muscles should go.  Adding them with legs and making the anatomy look good would be difficult.   Also, see that fork in the wing?  That's the elbow.  Real wings generally fork at the wrist and have a set of long straight ""fingers"" that support the rest of the wing.  Biologically, this creature's skeleton has two forearms on its wings, each with a wrist that leads to just one finger.   It might also need a second set of scapulas.  If I were drawing it I'd make the wings muscular with special emphasis on the deltoids and the lower parts of the pectorals and lattimus dorsi that pull the wings down towards the tail.   I'd knit the pectorals into the ribs at the side instead of the keel, and I'd  put the scapulas on the wing shoulders.  I think the idea of a second forarm is neat, I'd probably make it much less muscular than the first and make the wings much bigger to emphasize the extra area that makes it necessary to have heavier bones than just fingers to support the weight of the dragon.  And lastly I'd draw it with wavy lines that intersect and wobble with zero perspective or consistency because I can't draw for shit."
ImaginaryMonsters,3d0jjk,blockplanner,3,Sun Jul 12 15:27:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this. I hope you don't mind if I save this comment for reference!  I'm an illustrator, and dragons are what I do most and am best known for. I always do my best to make them as anatomically plausible as possible (with some allowances for size/weight issues and if I happen to feel like adding flashy horns). The front legs plus wings issue is one of the biggest I've run into, so I mostly stick to wyverns (hind legs, wings, deep chest for a keel and big lungs)  I think I'm actually gonna give that a shot now. I've done ""dragon anatomy"" pieces before, but they're old, I didn't know what I was doing, and it showed."
ImaginaryMonsters,3d0jjk,Pythosblaze,2,Sun Jul 12 17:14:24 2015 UTC,"For armed dragons, I usually go in with the approach that it has two full sets of shoulders, pecs etc., stacked directly on top of one another, kind of like Goro but with more pronounced lower pectorals.  Which set is used for arms or wings is pretty much interchangeable, depending on if you want giant muscular top wings (which I favor, since I don't see dragons having hollow bones) and smaller arms; or larger, tree trunky arms with underscooping wings.  The wings themselves are always taken from known anatomy, birds, bats, dinosaurs."
ImaginaryMonsters,3d0jjk,thejustducky1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:55:18 2015 UTC,"Well here's the skeleton for the one I'm working on right now (not even a finished sketch, so sorry if it's hard to make out).   And here is a slightly older quadruped dragon of mine, for an example with flesh. Not that you can see much what with all the scales.  So yeah it's something like the example you linked. The skeletal structure is complete for both sets, with some muscles a little more developed on each. I do also tend towards chunkier dragons with short front legs and big wings, but that's more for aesthetic reasons.  Edit: Finished the drawing, in case anyone might be interested"

Check out his short lessons learned, if you haven't.  Edit : in case it was unclear in his opinion the sequel to dark crystal was for all intents and purposes dead currently.

In a crucial moment he calls upon the half Rakshasa son of Bhima, Ghotatkacha to attack Karna.   As the half Rakshasa uses his Maya (powers of  Illusion) to spread dread and confusion among the troops and grows to an immense size,  Karna let's loose the insta-kill arrow.

The fact that a creature can turn into a human being, someone I might even know, doesn't bother me, but it's catching them in the act of shifting that's...weird. I can never stand to watch as the face of another human being becomes fluid, literally coming apart and changing into something else, bringing it home that it's flesh is little more than hunks of twitching, quivering meat. The end results are fine: I can see a before and after set of pics where my grandma turned into a rabid Chewbacca and be fine. I just can't bear to see the actual process of the transformation itself."

No idea really. The beams of the full moon shined into my room and lighted everything up. Guess I just felt like dancing. But after that, whenever I saw the moon a jolt of energy went through me.

ImaginaryMonsters,3bdk9k,Colonel_Pusstache,22,Sun Jun 28 05:11:34 2015 UTC,This is a nice picture but I would think that her muscles would run from her spine to her front like more horizontal than vertical. Those vertical muscles should stop at her ass. The way you have it drawn leaves you wondering what those ligaments are attached to in the middle of her fin. Just a thought to try to keep it anatomically correct.
ImaginaryMonsters,3bdk9k,Misappropriated,3,Sun Jun 28 06:45:43 2015 UTC,"It doesn't really come across like I'd hoped here because of the way she's cut open, but the idea was to have overlapping muscles that ran the length of her tail. So the sections where her spine and intestines are slightly visible are a deeper view into her, and would ordinarily have another muscle covering them. They sort of stair-step from her hips and converge towards each other near the tail's tip. It's not apparent here (cuz she's all contorted) but in the book there are full layouts that show all the muscles and a definite lack of knee-tail.  TL;DR- I think I will change her musculature so it's less ""knee-like"" in that image :) Thanks for the suggestion!"

ImaginaryMonsters,3bdk9k,deltree711,2,Sun Jun 28 20:54:53 2015 UTC,"Okay, people have been asking on the x-posts so here goes-  Mermaids are non-mammalian, belonging to a category of warm-blooded aquatic animals adapted for foraging in shallow seas. Their resemblance to human women is a result of tens of thousands of years of sustained unintentional artificial selection by sailors across multiple continents and cultures.  Originally, their hairless streamlined bodies more closely resembled other more familiar sea creatures, with the notable exception of two dexterous forward appendages adapted to pulling open shellfish, and a bowling pin shaped body that gave the vague impression of a human “head”. Pictures in the book. They were, at least initially, only vaguely and incidentally humanoid in appearance. Early cultures fishing for the mermaid’s ancestors would toss back those that looked the most human, generally as a ritualistic appeasement for taking the less beautiful ones as food. This tendency, combined with the creature’s brief lifespan and prolific breeding began to heavily influence the appearance of surviving mermaids. As human influence expanded across much of the known world mermaids followed and continued to adapt (often moving into new ecosystems and taking the place of other coastal aquatic species less favored by humanity).  Soon technical efficiency became less important to mermaid survival than traits that appealed to the aesthetic preferences of the humans whose company they kept. In the modern world most humans no longer hunt or eat mermaids specifically because of their unsettling appearance, and the species has continued to thrive. Both male and female mermaids now highly resemble stereotypically attractive human women, as the “breasts” are a favorable accumulation of insulating fat without nipples or function beyond their buoyancy. Female mermaids deposit eggs in long strands of mucus and males fertilize them by passing near and ejecting sperm. You’ll see a collection of rougher scales surrounding a fin near the bottom of the picture (near the Kickstarter logo) this is the cloaca-like opening for their reproductive and waste disposal systems.  Hope that made sense, I'm having to sort of work backwards from existing concepts that are silly and non-scientific and explaining how they work in (sorta) believable and interesting ways. The fun part was imagining and illustrating a lineage of mermaid-like species that felt like they had a believable incidental resemblance to humans (fish+manatee-ish?). I was intrigued by the idea of a species that looked very human, but was in no way related and had come by this resemblance in a different way. There's a lot more info and illustration in the book, along with first-person accounts by sailors and naturalists studying and interacting with these creatures."

ImaginaryMonsters,3b7mlg,HankyChief,8,Fri Jun 26 19:11:12 2015 UTC,The double negative makes my brain itch.
ImaginaryMonsters,3b7mlg,Tikka_T3,24,Fri Jun 26 21:54:44 2015 UTC,"I forgot to capitalize it.  It's a play on words, Odysseus told the Cyclops his name was 'Nobody' before poking him in the eye with a stick."
ImaginaryMonsters,3b7mlg,MarkFluffalo,10,Fri Jun 26 17:34:23 2015 UTC,"For anyone who might want to read that but not want to look it up   ‘As he finished speaking I handed him the bright wine. Three times I poured and gave it to him, and three times, foolishly, he drained it. When the wine had fuddled his wits I tried him with subtle words: “Cyclops, you asked my name, and I will tell it: give me afterwards a guest gift as you promised. My name is Nobody. Nobody, my father, mother, and friends call me.”  Those were my words, and this his cruel answer: “Then, my gift is this. I will eat Nobody last of all his company, and all the others before him”.  As he spoke, he reeled and toppled over on his back, his thick neck twisted to one side, and all-conquering sleep overpowered him. In his drunken slumber he vomited wine and pieces of human flesh. Then I thrust the stake into the depth of the ashes to heat it, and inspired my men with encouraging words, so none would hang back from fear. When the olivewood stake was glowing hot, and ready to catch fire despite its greenness, I drew it from the coals, then my men stood round me, and a god breathed courage into us. They held the sharpened olivewood stake, and thrust it into his eye, while I threw my weight on the end, and twisted it round and round, as a man bores the timbers of a ship with a drill that others twirl lower down with a strap held at both ends, and so keep the drill continuously moving. We took the red-hot stake and twisted it round and round like that in his eye, and the blood poured out despite the heat. His lids and brows were scorched by flame from the burning eyeball, and its roots crackled with fire. As a great axe or adze causes a vast hissing when the smith dips it in cool water to temper it, strengthening the iron, so his eye hissed against the olivewood stake. Then he screamed, terribly, and the rock echoed. Seized by terror we shrank back, as he wrenched the stake, wet with blood, from his eye. He flung it away in frenzy, and called to the Cyclopes, his neighbours who lived in caves on the windy heights. They heard his cry, and crowding in from every side they stood by the cave mouth and asked what was wrong: “Polyphemus, what terrible pain is this that makes you call through deathless night, and wake us? Is a mortal stealing your flocks, or trying to kill you by violence or treachery?”  Out of the cave came mighty Polyphemus’ voice: “Nobody, my friends, is trying to kill me by violence or treachery.”  To this they replied with winged words: “If you are alone, and nobody does you violence, it’s an inescapable sickness that comes from Zeus: pray to the Lord Poseidon, our father.”"

ImaginaryMonsters,3b33s8,Steves3511,57,Thu Jun 25 16:03:54 2015 UTC,"Amazing work, but if we're taking ASOIAF it's Balerion the Black Dread!"
ImaginaryMonsters,3b33s8,FearLeadsToAnger,42,Thu Jun 25 18:13:17 2015 UTC,"Really great, I like it a lot.    My only criticism is that Balerion is undersized.    He looks maybe 10 meters here, when he was around 75m tall (a little under 250 feet).  This is a more accurate representation of his size:  http://img01.deviantart.net/83bf/i/2015/160/3/9/balerion_the_black_dread_by_lindseyburcar-d7kacvo.png  Again though, it's a very impressive drawing, great work."
ImaginaryMonsters,3b33s8,amphetaminesfailure,26,Thu Jun 25 18:39:00 2015 UTC,"Its not exactly clear when Balerion got to that size, though.  Dragons in ASOIAF grow continually until death, and Balerion lived 70+ years after the scene depicted at Harrenhal.  That's almost half the 200ish year lifespan we've seen from dragons.  The official artwork places Balerion at closer to OP's size."
ImaginaryMonsters,3b33s8,GumdropGoober,12,Thu Jun 25 18:43:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks everyone, glad you all like the piece  FearLeadsToAnger- Gahhh I cannot believe I screwed up the name!  I am usually really good about checking for spellings but I guess I was so confident I had it right I didnt check...dummy on my part.  amphetaminesfailure and GumdropGoober- I was always under the impression that the scene at Harrenhal was when Balerion was younger and still growing and was not at his full monstrous size, I did not double check the book on this so I could be wrong.  Also I did not want to make him too big because I wanted to have Aegon in the painting too (even at this size Aegon is super tiny)"
ImaginaryMonsters,3b33s8,thepinkpedagogue,8,Thu Jun 25 18:53:20 2015 UTC,I just want to applaud you for drawing a dragon with wings large enough that it could realistically fly.
ImaginaryMonsters,3b33s8,Dat_Friend,7,Thu Jun 25 20:43:55 2015 UTC,Thanks! That is also a major pet peeve of mine with dragon art.  I always try to make the wings on my dragons look large enough to make flight look feasible
ImaginaryMonsters,3b33s8,BatMannwith2Ns,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:05:25 2015 UTC,When I See those big dragons I'm always wondering what they eat.
ImaginaryMonsters,3b33s8,thepinkpedagogue,7,Fri Jun 26 10:36:54 2015 UTC,"The reason dragons fly is because they eat limestone that turns into helium in their stomach which gets distributed throughout the body allowing them to fly while also using it as fire fuel with help from a spark gland in their throat which also helps bring them back to the ground, the wings are just for guiding. Duh."
ImaginaryMonsters,3b33s8,amphetaminesfailure,3,Fri Jun 26 08:30:22 2015 UTC,I'll allow it!! New headlore.
ImaginaryMonsters,3b33s8,jew_who_says_ni,3,Fri Jun 26 08:32:39 2015 UTC,That's true.  I'd still say that in the official artwork you posted he's at least around three times the size of OP's art.    Aegon was described as being tall so let's say he's a exactly 2 meters in height.    Balerion's head alone in the official artwork has to be 5 or 6 meters.

The rest of it stems from trying to think of what kind of creatures might live up in a snowy mountain environment, things like yeti with their matted hair and messy cruft of stuff tangled in their fur, maybe something like a cursed mountain man doomed to live his remaining years as this abomination of creatures mixed together with dark magic...  Something like that, glad you liked it :)"

ImaginaryMonsters,3achts,VeXCe,5,Fri Jun 19 08:04:12 2015 UTC,"In 1732, the first reference to the ""mosquito man"" was recorded by Capt. William Garrett of the Savannah garrison.   ""The local Cree are industrious and not at all the savages earlier reports have painted them to be. They retain, however, certain naive superstitions owing to their relative vulnerability to the elements and a lack of understanding of their proper and entirely natural causes.   One such local superstition concerns the waq-ahana, or the 'mosquito man.' The Cree believe that he is a guardian of small streams and their crossings, a sort of elemental spirit inextricably tied to water. For this reason, the Cree do not allow their children to draw water alone, nor do they make a habit of camping too close to creekbeds (a folk memory of flash floods, perhaps?). In appearance he presents about ten feet tall and entirely devoid of skin. His flesh seems to be made of ropy tendrils or branches, like sticks that have moldered at the bottom of a creek bed. With his fingerless tendrils, he is said to pierce the skin between the clavicle and the shoulder blade to draw blood directly from his victim's hearts - hence the 'mosquito man' moniker.  Some of the more common soldiers in the garrison have reported something tall and sinuous moving through the trees near Bear Creek in the early morning. I've made a note to the quartermaster to cut the rum ration by two-thirds and spoke with Ma'ahani, our Cree liaison, about sharing his bogey-tales with the men."""
ImaginaryMonsters,3achts,MiguelForte,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:56:33 2015 UTC,"That's fucking perfect. Only doubt I have is the date and general's name - maybe we can have some info that happened in real life to make it even more legit when someone googles the story, in the future. But that's just a minor observation. Outside of that, that tale is genial!  We now need to put the story out there and let the mosquito man gather some fans and even more pics about him, like what happened to slendy. I'll see what can be done. Have you got any ideas?"

Nature is a big network, and every cell would attack it, nature knows when there is something completely unnatural. It's like immune system of earth... Like it was in 'War of the Worlds'. And we can see how nature reacts on humanity... We're part of it, but we're damaging it. It sends signals to us, warns and sometime even roars, but it won't kill us, because we're part of it."

He kept calling his riding elk a horse, and in the end named it ""Kon"", the Slovak word for horse.  (Our players were all part of a society based on the ancient Slavs).    During the last session, I told everyone ""while horses don't exist there are many other animals that can make potential mounts.  I'm open to ideas.""  My friend immediately piped up and said ""I want a unicorn.""  Imagining his ancient barbarian astride an adorable unicorn is something I'm not interested in.  However, THIS unicorn is definitely something that could exist in the world I'm building.  Thanks for the inspiration!"
ImaginaryMonsters,396p8b,SteveSketches,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:02:09 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind me asking, how come there is no horses in your world? I've played some Tabletop RPGs where I was the GM but I've never strayed to far from the classic knights, elves and orcs concept and would love to know how you make it so your world sets itself apart from others."
ImaginaryMonsters,396p8b,BikerPanda,2,Sat Jul 4 23:42:08 2015 UTC,"Well, I've been building this world for years here and there in my head.  I've only recently started putting it to paper, and I'm going to start running my third campaign in it on Friday.  It's still pretty bare bones.  That said, I've touched on quite a few things that set my world apart from others.  I'm a big fan of all things fantasy, so of course I love Tolkein's Numenorian mythos.  However, I've always found myself drawn to Tolkein's contemporary and friend, C.S. Lewis.  I find Narnia just as compelling as Middle Earth.  Most RPG's derive their inspiration from Tolkein, so I'm trying to set my world apart in key ways.  I also wanted to avoid the overwhelming complexity of most modern RPG's, with their ridiculous number of monsters, planes, class options, gods, etc, etc.    First thing I shot down were elves, dwarves, halflings, gnomes, orcs, dragons, etc.  I basically said ""This is not a Tolkein world, this is my world.""  The problem with those races are that they have so many stereotypes.  You could fit them all very neatly in nice little boxes and no one would care.  I wanted all the races to be just as dynamic and diverse as humanity is.  I only have four playable races in my world.  Humans, Varmin (rodent men), Ogres (big, hairy, sort of a mix between man, boar and hound), and Fairies (pixies and sprites, just the little ones.)  Each race has a metric butt ton of diversity, and none are put into boxes.  You'll find a kind rat man just as easily as you'll find a kind ogre, that sort of thing.  And then of course there's a ton of physical diversity as well.  Ogres that live in the arctic mountains look very different than those that live in the desert.  That's just one example of removing and replacing.  Horses are another.  I found that most fantasy settings just add to what's already here on Earth, they never subtract.  So I subtracted.  I'll admit, this has actually caused more problems than not, since a fantasy world without horses is straight up confusing.  We're just so used to them being there, always present, no matter how weird things get.  I figured I could just replace them with elk, mountain goats, giant boars, caribou, red harts, and other things like that, but my players (and myself) keep saying ""Horse"".  It's pretty silly.  So choosing the right things to change can be tricky.  Other things I've changed:  No pantheons.  You can worship whatever gods you like, but as far as the world is concerned there is only one God and one Devil.  I'm running off of both Tolkein and Lewis for this one, as they both use Christianity as a base for their worlds.  In this sense I also removed Paladins and Clerics as playable classes.  No divine healing, sorry bros.  Also no planes.  One world is plenty, and if your players are bored in that world, you've done something seriously wrong.    Magic is a real substance.  It's not some ethereal thing that you can reach out and touch if you really, really, really want to. (The lack of planes make this a problem!)  You have to go find magic.  Magic in my world is found within plants.  It literally grows from the earth.  It's rare, but those that can find it may be able to use it.  Pixies are particularly good at finding and cultivating gardens of magical plants, which they guard jealously.  There are other sources of magic in my world, but you probably don't want to mess with those.  Good and Evil are hard to define.  There is no alignment system.  Characters are people, and people are complex.  You can't look at a person and stick them in a box.  I like classic alignment systems in that they give players a direction, a sort of course of action.  The system breaks down when alignments are used as excuses, restrictions, or gameplay mechanics (i.e. protection from evil spells, or forced alignment changes, etc.)  If your characters are going to be interacting with people, they're going to be bumping up against a lot of ""good"" people, and a lot of ""evil"" people.  The story becomes interesting when we see ""evil"" people doing good things.  Where does that good come from?  Or what about when we see ""good"" people do evil things?  Where did that come from?  Why did they do that?  It's much more compelling than saying ""Hey!  Play to your alignment!""    Whew, I've probably said too much.  Needless to say, it's a lot of stuff, much more than I can write here.  (I'm keeping the juiciest secrets to myself. =P )  But that's the basics.  Thanks for being interested, it's been a great project to work on so far.  =)  Just a warning, doing something like this is a metric butt-ton of work.  I could make it easier on myself by filling my world with Tolkeinite subjects, but I've decided to rebel against pop-fantasy.  Imitate at your own risk.  ~Steve"
ImaginaryMonsters,396p8b,SteveSketches,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:34:15 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. I feel more comfortable with the standard fantasy setting since it allows me to populate the world with fleshed out characters, conflicting politics and several story-threads for my players. Not saying it's impossible to have all that in a original setting but I prefer to keep my focus on the inhabitants of the world, rather than the world itself.  With that being said, I really do appreciate an original idea and concept and yours is indeed very fascinating. I especially liked what you said about subtracting things that already exist on our Earth and I'm glad that you took time out to explain your world and your process in making it. Hopefully in the future I'll be adding more original elements to my worlds and, as you said, subtract the less creative parts for something more interesting and engaging."

It can take a human form, but will often have animal features, such as ears or a tail.As an animal it will most commonly appear as a horse, rabbit, goat, goblin, or dog.

It's visually very busy, actually pretty much all of this guy's work is crazy busy, it makes me feel panicked just looking at some of it. In this particular piece is looks like he photobashed a lot of random parts, and then didn't really adjust for lighting or perspective on some of it, like the inner mouth is out perspective with the head, and the shadows aren't dark enough. Seeing it smaller works better, so I assume it's for some Korean mobile TCG, as it's very in style with Korean games. When it gets full size on a computer screen though, all the weird photobash, perspective and lighting inconsistencies really pop out."

ImaginaryMonsters,38cbv0,Finitevus,2,Wed Jun 3 08:24:14 2015 UTC,"Autopsy Report Excerpt- As anticipated internal organs reflect extra-terrestrial origin: overall complexity precludes classification and identification. Notably, the central nervous system [analogous] was characterized by multiple nodes networked throughout the body, extreme density of cerebral matter, various unknown ganglia, all connecting through a rigid head [analogous] lacking notable sensory organs.  The creature's external and structural anatomy suggesting a level of development far exceeding our own, all while retaining a troubling similarity to human physiology. All findings are speculative. Despite structural similarities to human anatomy, the creature's nervous system is of such unusual composition that it's unlikely that we will be able to comprehend its functions, much less the creature's motivations.  Unknown artifact/mechanism- Accompanying the creature were three segmented spheres of unknown composition that orbited the specimen before its death. These have so far resisted any attempts at tampering, damage, or even chemical sampling. All three objects stopped their motions at the exact moment of the creature's death. They currently appear for all intents and purposes inert. Despite this, they are being kept in separate level 4 security vaults under 24 hour surveillance and heavy guard.    Speculation- Why should a creature of such baffling complexity and distinction reflect human physiology? Is this being an emissary? A distant cousin? An astonishing example of parallel evolution?  [Addendum]- Many initial witnesses report a feeling of deep unease and dread when confronted by the creature [above and beyond what might be expected by suddenly encountering an alien]. Several more specifically report not being disturbed by the specimen itself, but rather were struck suddenly with a terrible certainty that it merely preceded something about which all sentient life on Earth should be deeply and immediately concerned. Was it attempting to warn us? Or to threaten us?"

It's a lot of fun, but it can be a bit challenging your first few run throughs. After that, there's the long war mod, which adds an insane amount of new content, but makes the game significantly more challenging. Shameless plug for /r/xcom if you want to learn more."

ImaginaryMonsters,37py8a,cuptits,3,Fri May 29 15:40:19 2015 UTC,"I was going to say something similar as well; when you make a character pigeon toed like this it makes it feel clumsy, cute, or girlish. A wide, solid stance with feet facing forward/out exudes confidence and power, which would be a little more compelling for a warrior like this. Other than that I love the style and colors, looks great!"
ImaginaryMonsters,37py8a,HallsInTheKid,3,Fri May 29 15:44:45 2015 UTC,As i said I wanted it to look that way and sway and be lanky. It gives it a dynamic sense of the corruption and undeath it has to sustain. I'm ok with flat-footed/foreward facing feet but that's not what I wanted for it. But hey thanks for your point of view :)

ImaginaryMonsters,37kfnb,One_Giant_Nostril,11,Thu May 28 07:30:29 2015 UTC,The Lovecraftian King in Yellow?
ImaginaryMonsters,37kfnb,herpurderpurson,6,Thu May 28 12:57:33 2015 UTC,"Actually Lovecraft is the creator of the Yellow Sign. Another author - Robert W. Chambers - is inspired by the idea and creates his book of short stories entitled The King in Yellow, where we can see the use of the Yellow Sign. The book is amazing, close to the Lovecraftian genre and style, although a bit romantic at places. I still highly recommend it. Lovely read."
ImaginaryMonsters,37kfnb,setbg,21,Thu May 28 14:24:15 2015 UTC,"I believe it's the other way around, unless I didn't quite catch what you meant. Chambers wrote about the King in Yellow first, in 1895 and Lovecraft later published his own works influenced by it.  It appears that Lovecraft was only a 5 year old boy when The King in Yellow was first published."
ImaginaryMonsters,37kfnb,Morinmeth,5,Thu May 28 14:32:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, The King in Yellow is written by Chambers entirely. Although I assumed that it was inspired by Lovecraft for some odd reason, never thought it could be the other way around! Thank you for the clarification."

Strange is the night where black stars rise,  And strange moons circle through the skies,  But stranger still is  Lost Carcosa.  Songs that the Hyades shall sing,  Where flap the tatters of the King,  Must die unheard in  Dim Carcosa.  Song of my soul, my voice is dead,  Die thou, unsung, as tears unshed  Shall dry and die in  Lost Carcosa."

ImaginaryMonsters,37gg7g,bohemica,6,Wed May 27 18:57:33 2015 UTC,"I dunno.  There's some things about the teeth that interest me.  There's the multiple layers/scrambled about thing he's got going on, which disrupts what might otherwise be a natural looking jaw, and there's the blackness.  The blackness prevents you from connecting the top and bottom jaw, and it makes you wonder how far does that mouth actually go?  The part I don't like is the angry eyes.  I can't see why you'd need to make Cthulhu look angry.  It makes him look more natural, more human even.  That's not good."
ImaginaryMonsters,37gg7g,venicello,4,Wed May 27 21:51:40 2015 UTC,"Right it implies Cthulhu needs nutrients or needs to eat, which makes it a comprehendible organism in at least one way."

ImaginaryMonsters,36vup8,TheCynicalMe,11,Fri May 22 21:14:27 2015 UTC,"The first sounds of death rose suddenly over the clamor of midday crowds, like children begging for their mothers in high-pitched wails. Barmen, whores, gamblers, and drunks all became food for the demon before the law could catch up to it. They surrounded the little building, watching as blood ran down the windows and over the front stair. Weapons loaded, lead ready, the sheriff and his deputies approached the saloon with caution, not wanting to disturb the beast before it was in their sights. But they were trespassing in its new nest, and they too became prey to its claws, reaching from the darkened entryway to eviscerate the three men before they could cross the threshold. As their blood stained the dusty ground, the demon lowered its head to feast on the sheriff's corpse.   Before a single fang could touch the body, a blast of fire and lead slammed into the demon's black hide, hurling it backwards in pain and rage. A traveler, clad in sandy garb with a dark red kerchief around his neck and a wide-brimmed hat over his eyes, holstered his smoking pistol, eyes locked on his foe. The beast retreated into the darkness of the bloodied saloon, ready to protect its nest.  The traveler strode past the bloodied bodies of the sheriff and his deputies, sparing brief seconds for a quick prayer to guide them home. The doorway to the bar was torn apart by claws and hate, leading him deep into hell itself. The monster crouched low over the bar, waiting for its foe to approach. Hand grasping tight his old revolver, his sword and shield against evil, Joshua lowered his head and stepped into the demon's lair."

ImaginaryMonsters,36qrs1,cowboy_horse,11,Fri May 22 00:47:27 2015 UTC,Very interested in why you chose the design you did. Why the long neck and downward horns?   I think it looks terrifying just curious in the design choice
ImaginaryMonsters,36qrs1,bonus_prick,9,Thu May 21 14:36:20 2015 UTC,"That's a good question, I'll have to ponder about such decisions because most of my choices during the drawing process are aesthetic in essence and barely have any thought to them (bummer).  But I don't think this makes them senseless, my intentions from the beginning were to create a scary, shady and morbid monstruosity. So, in general, long thin necks (long thin anything) are a scary attribute. Other decisions like the aimless eyes or the judgemental pose add to this scary vibe.  The horns are a compositional component, they bring focus to his blank stare and bring some exoticness to the monster.  Thanks for the question."

ImaginaryMonsters,36nbzr,One_Giant_Nostril,3,Wed May 20 17:16:43 2015 UTC,"Lake Hurwitz's deviantART gallery and website. The image above is one of the artist's personal illustration work.  You might remember his The Magpie God posted here a few weeks ago.  Inspira is a form of inspirer. The 'Raw Inspira' of the title would seem to indicate that by her holding of the raw fish in her hands, she is suddenly stuck by an inspiration. What that inspiration is, one can only guess - perhaps it's taking of the fish was wrong... or maybe a vision of a frypan and melted butter :D"
ImaginaryMonsters,36nbzr,Arsonade,2,Wed May 20 17:31:30 2015 UTC,"That is an incredible piece, it really caught me off-guard. To me the 'inspiration' seems to be something like an awareness of flesh or embodiment. There's also her expression which looks like its mimicking the expression of the fish. She seems to be allowing her blanket to slip into the water despite the fact that it looks to be her only possession here -  whatever she has just realized it has completely overridden her survival instinct. Then there's that redness of flesh reflecting on the water, which to me seems to suggest that the flesh coming from her head is not meant to be something wholly abstract. Its hard to tell but it also looks like a stormy or at least foreboding scene, and is that a large wave off on the left?  To me this seems to say something relating to all of those things; a sudden awareness of the rock-solid reality of death and embodied life, an overwhelming awareness itself as serious as death, in the midst of potentially imminent danger.  Maybe I'm reading too much into the whole thing but regardless, pretty incredible. I kept wanting to look closer to find more details."

ImaginaryMonsters,36f7rs,shmwy,5,Mon May 18 22:38:14 2015 UTC,Why is the tail so muscular?
ImaginaryMonsters,36f7rs,beeblebroxh2g2,20,Tue May 19 01:12:35 2015 UTC,"Well, as an expert cryptozoologist I'd assume that it's not a tail at all, it's an abdomen.  When making assumptions about unknown species you can't reasonably speculate outside of what is known to exist.    And what we know about vertebrates is that every single one we have ever encountered is limited to six limbs (four arms/wings/legs, one head, and one tail).  They also only ever have two eyes and one mouth.  You could call those limitations evolutionary dead ends; as far as we can tell, it's not possible for a creature to naturally evolve more limbs or mouths or heads or spines because those features are so complicated that only specific, minor changes can occur in them.  As far as we can tell, adding another limb entirely could only ever be a detriment, so no species has ever done that.  Eyes are similar; adding nonfunctional eyes would be a huge detriment because they're prone to infection and damage.  But they're so complicated that no natural mutation would result in additional fully functional eyes.    The only creatures that have MORE than two eyes are ones that adapted with them at a time when their eyes had not evolved to be so complex.  This creatures has four eyes and six limbs, so we can assume that it's not a vertebrate.  While the structure of the legs may resemble that of a vertebrate, that's probably an example of convergent evolution.  Something like that can be adapted much easier than the number of limbs on a complex multi-organ animal.    Regardless, based on its size and shape, it's probably safe to assume that the structure on its hindsection is not a tail.    We can also probably assume that its hooves and antlers aren't made from keratin or bone; they're likely made of chitin, which is more common to arthropods and gastropods.  The head in particular looks like it has an exoskeleton, so I think this is probably an extremely divergent form of arthropod.  If the creature was closer to another documented species, there are a lot of little features we could speculate on.  Notice the folds at the base of the abdomen and the way the 'skin' stretches near the legs.   You can see a pattern underneath the abdomen which could give us insight into the body structure or function.  The bulges in its head, and the way the horns diverge slightly at the base leaving a gap.  The light mane behind the antlers.  All of those probably serve some kind of evolutionary function (maybe not in this species, but in closely related creatures)  Unfortunately since the creature is so far divergent from other, more thoroughly studied animals, none of those details are really useful to us.   For example, without more information we don't know if that abdomen is storing nutrients or organs or if it's just there for display.    Even just having more than four limbs puts this creature outside the realm of educated guessing for ninety nine percent of its physiology.  There's one bit of spectulation I'll commit to though:  This creature has many features that resemble a mammal despite the obvious indicators that it isn't even a vertebrate at all.  It has skin, ears, and muscle structure that strongly resembles what you'd expect on a mammal.  I would be willing to bet that this is an example of mimicry.  This creatures likely evolved alongside something that strongly resembles it, perhaps to take advantage of that species' social instincts."

ImaginaryMonsters,36f7rs,Icalasari,-3,Tue May 19 05:29:35 2015 UTC,"It's fun to imagine, but we should keep fantasy out of our speculation, it's rarely constructive.  Besides, if it were an alien species we wouldn't have this lovely photograph of it."

ImaginaryMonsters,3573dh,Diomniclod,4,Fri May 8 02:22:36 2015 UTC,"Xenomorphs radiate an aura of unluck that only affects humanoids, not aberrations. 5 mi radius for drones, 50 mi radius for queens.  How else does:  Nostromo self-destructs after Mother ignores Ripley...drone's unluck aura.  The firefight on LV-426 OF COURSE damages the cooling system, and dooms Hadley's Hope? Queen's aura means massively everything goes wrong, and you lose the whole colony.  In A3, it's just one drone again...we lose a bunch of inmates and Ripley dies (allegedly)  In A4, it's two queens (Ripley's the other one). You not only lose the ship, but Boom, the ship crash lands on Earth, ruins everyone's day near the blast radius.  Aliens. That's how they survive. Not with strength, speed, or acid blood. They are a walking curse."

ImaginaryMonsters,3573dh,Octro,1 point,Thu May 7 22:33:57 2015 UTC,This would be great if it was the one movie where things actually go according to terrible plan.  We're waiting the entire movie for them to break out and they end up being the salvation for the protagonists.
ImaginaryMonsters,3573dh,Setitimer,3,Fri May 8 13:14:10 2015 UTC,The body language of the woman says it all.
ImaginaryMonsters,3573dh,mrmangadrawer,3,Thu May 7 23:22:26 2015 UTC,I just noticed that both aliens are holding their arms in the same positions as the man

ImaginaryMonsters,3573dh,MostlyUselessFacts,7,Fri May 8 15:32:26 2015 UTC,I always thought they didn't had eyes.
ImaginaryMonsters,3573dh,frenchmeister,11,Thu May 7 21:51:07 2015 UTC,I guess it's for the guy to see through. Or maybe they've given them electronic eyes for some reason? I don't even know how aliens see to be honest.
ImaginaryMonsters,3573dh,OneTripleZero,3,Thu May 7 21:57:32 2015 UTC,Most likely the same way sharks sense electric fields in the water to help them hunt prey. That or perhaps the dome covers their eyes. In the original Alien the dome of their had was transparent and you could see a part of the human skull behind it.
ImaginaryMonsters,3573dh,frenchmeister,11,Fri May 8 09:00:30 2015 UTC,They have a skull underneath their transparent head. If you look up H. R. Giger's artwork (inspiration for the xenomorph) this feature is more apparent.
ImaginaryMonsters,3573dh,nothanksjustlooking,10,Thu May 7 22:43:10 2015 UTC,"http://collectionstash.com/files/2903_press02-001.jpg  See how the eyes are underneath the ""cowl"" or shell of the the xeno head? In the movies they make that transparent part much darker, but that's the idea - I could find a better picture if I spent more time on google."
ImaginaryMonsters,3573dh,tapedeckgh0st,2,Fri May 8 00:36:52 2015 UTC,"The eyes I understand, but why do they have a nasal aperture under there? They can probably see if the carapace is translucent or something, but there's no way they can breathe through that thing. Are their skulls are supposed to look similar to ours or something?"
ImaginaryMonsters,3573dh,phis6,9,Fri May 8 05:59:10 2015 UTC,"Are their skulls are supposed to look similar to ours or something?   Yes, because they're essentially half human."
ImaginaryMonsters,3573dh,frenchmeister,5,Fri May 8 07:06:42 2015 UTC,"Oooooh, that's right, they end up with their host's genes. I thought I was missing something since I only ever saw the first movie, but no. I was just being stupid."
ImaginaryMonsters,3573dh,mrmangadrawer,2,Fri May 8 09:22:52 2015 UTC,What is their base look? Purebreed?
ImaginaryMonsters,3573dh,CoffeeAndKarma,2,Fri May 8 13:11:47 2015 UTC,Pretty sure their carrier is as close as you get with a 'base' look since from what I recall they always take the hosts genes
ImaginaryMonsters,3573dh,CdnRazer,3,Fri May 8 14:18:15 2015 UTC,"In short : xenomorphs take on the characteristics of their hosts. Implant one in a dog and it will be more dog like, same for putting one in a predator. It is touched on in several of the novels and darkhorse comics that xenomorphs sense pheromones and can be controlled by scents."
ImaginaryMonsters,3573dh,Aspel,1 point,Fri May 8 12:49:43 2015 UTC,I remember seeing a dog in a xenomorph costume that they were thinking of using in one of the movies in a scaled down set but it just looked like a dog in a goofy costume. I don't remember if the fact that they were part human was mentioned in Alien but if not I definitely should have remembered about the dog-xeno hybrid :P

The knife, torch or flail?"

ImaginaryMonsters,34wwgq,TheKrowefawkes,7,Tue May 5 17:12:27 2015 UTC,"In the first Witcher you could pick up/sell weapons dropped by enemies. Dirks and shorter swords, flails or clubs and torches. I recall several axes as well. They were all inferior to the two weapons you start out with, but you could still use them. Your perks and feats for your two swords don't apply to them either, making them tit useless."

ImaginaryMonsters,34wwgq,TheKrowefawkes,7,Tue May 5 17:32:01 2015 UTC,"I wonder why it has Orthodox crosses though, it isn't a Polish nor Witcher's tradition."
ImaginaryMonsters,34wwgq,Rajhin,9,Tue May 5 13:24:25 2015 UTC,Because Orthodox lands were traditionally referred to in Poland literally as the Wild East. And add to that the cultural memory of half your armies freezing to death every time you try to conquer Russia and it makes a wonderful candidate for a very severe winter place roamed by werewolves.  It would be very strange if none of the Witcher books featured Russia. Imagine a pulp horror series set in the Wild West but without any Mexicans.

ImaginaryMonsters,34wwgq,HazMat68W,4,Tue May 5 13:48:35 2015 UTC,"I know the question has been answered, but I'll throw my two cents in. From a gameplay perspective, don't play the first, mechanics are horrid, but the story is good. If you're a lore fan, by all means go ahead and play it. I did, even though I'm not a lore fan.  If you don't want to play it watch this, it's the official recap from CD Projekt Red. It also gives you a clue as to what a witcher is.  The second game is really good. I won't give a review, but the game is worth playing in my opinion. If you don't want to that's fine. The devs have stated that The Witcher 3 is completely playable without even knowing that the two first exist.   I'm sure they're going to give a recap of the two first before you start the third one. Or at least a short overview of the general lore of Geralt, Ciri, Yennefer, and Kaer Morhen and the witchers.  If you're into reading, check out the books that the series is based on!"

ImaginaryMonsters,34u5za,ccleveland,5,Mon May 4 16:17:40 2015 UTC,I had to stop reading Lovecraft before bed because I would get awful nightmares.
ImaginaryMonsters,34u5za,Futurames,7,Mon May 4 20:37:15 2015 UTC,I think this picture is too symmetrical.
ImaginaryMonsters,34u5za,CarrioTine,11,Mon May 4 21:53:07 2015 UTC,"I always have the same thought when I see drawings of cthulu. Whenever these beings were glimpsed (or the cities involved) I recall great length going into explaining how the planes were wrong, how things didn't fit together correctly, how it was immediately deep in your bones clear that this thing was different in an unfathomable way.  And every drawing is like: ITS GODZILLA WITH TENTACLES"
ImaginaryMonsters,34u5za,Kchortu,8,Mon May 4 22:20:04 2015 UTC,Its tough to draw that though...
ImaginaryMonsters,34u5za,gjallerhorn,7,Mon May 4 22:38:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's kinda what my point was. Cthulhu is always pretty nice artistic-wise when put into drawings. It used to bother me so much, but now it's just kind of like ""Well, that's how it goes I guess."""
ImaginaryMonsters,34u5za,CarrioTine,2,Mon May 4 22:28:18 2015 UTC,"That's the trick with drawing Lovecraft beasties, in my experience. Walking the line between indescribable inter-dimensional horror and Godzilla with an octopus hat is touch and go. I tend to err on the side of the recognizable; sometimes I explain my drawings as snapshots. Cthulhu is a fluid entity, after all, constantly shifting shape and silhouette. Looking at it that way, all portraits could be valid. Or none, since they're two-dimensional representations of something that occupies a lot more. Now my brain hurts. I understand your frustration though - trust me, it's frustrating for the artists, too."
ImaginaryMonsters,34u5za,Kchortu,2,Tue May 5 18:14:08 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I'm not saying it's easy or that this was a bad attempt, it's just a frustration with the constraints of reality D:  If someone did capture that side of Cthulu well I'd be blown away"
ImaginaryMonsters,34u5za,BartKaell,3,Tue May 5 22:38:53 2015 UTC,Is this some joke i'm missing or do you really see symmetry in this?
ImaginaryMonsters,34u5za,CarrioTine,7,Mon May 4 21:55:23 2015 UTC,"If this Cthulhu was standing head on from you, it'd be super symmetrical, even though he's supposedly extremely non-symmetrical. Artistically, the weight is fairly even horizontally, but vertically it's got more of a visual weight on the bottom, but it's still symmetrical, just not bilaterally so. Also it was a joke."

ImaginaryMonsters,34sgjq,ThemeFinland,1 point,Mon May 4 04:16:08 2015 UTC,Cool backstory!  I wonder what kinda of personality she's given it though?    The gold looks a bit off though.
ImaginaryMonsters,34sgjq,Narroo,2,Mon May 4 16:42:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'd imagine her being manipulative and deceptive as well as ruthless when pursuing her goals. before she contacted the demons she would have been spiteful, desperate, maybe even submissive, as she would have lost her pride at that point as well as having realized that she didn't know how to live on earth. However after that, having gained back a large portion of her former glory, albeit in a different form, she gained a more vile personality. Perhaps her infatuation to collecting wealth was just a way to pretend she was still the goddess of fortune.  As for the gold, can you pinpoint how I could improve it?"
ImaginaryMonsters,34sgjq,Narroo,3,Mon May 4 17:11:36 2015 UTC,"Well, the nugget really doesn't look like gold; it looks like a lump of glowing yellow with some shadows.  It's rather hard to tell what it's suppose to be.  If nothing else, it doesn't look metallic.  The pile of gold has similar issues and lacks a bit of definition compared to the rest of the painting.  The pile also doesn't really look as fluid as one would imagine (doesn't seem to really conform or deform.)  Aside from that, it would be interesting that, while spiteful against the gods, she wouldn't be completely vile so much as a ""society sucks; screw social norms.""   If she's really some kind of Empress I'd love some citizen say: ""but she has a great personality."""
ImaginaryMonsters,34sgjq,Narroo,2,Mon May 4 18:01:48 2015 UTC,"Alrighty, I think I understood your critique and went ahead and improved those areas a bit. It's not perfect, but at least I think the large gold nugget looks more like gold and less like a yellow blob, haha! You can check out the improved version on the same link, as I just overwrote the old one. Anyways, thanks for the critique, I have been drawing gold like that for awhile now and I think your critique allowed me to look at those flaws.  Oh she wouldn't go full on ""screw everything"" mode, afterall, she needs to leave some people alive to make herself richer. Haha, I doubt many people would say that, but I imagined her to lean much more towards manipulating people to get what she wants, rather than straight out kill anyone who has a gold coin. And that empress part isn't to be taken literally, as that part I intended to be on a metaphorical level. Like how in the medieval times a lot of wars were waged on greed alone, so in essence she would be controlling those greedy kings and emperors from behind the curtains."

ImaginaryMonsters,34nbt7,gonnaburnthem,27,Sat May 2 21:09:46 2015 UTC,"That tends to happen with some scifi series. Orson Scott Card does it every time, for instance."
ImaginaryMonsters,34nbt7,blankscientist,11,Sat May 2 22:31:25 2015 UTC,"Card has very strong socio-political beliefs.  Now, I don't mind someone using their fiction to talk about their beliefs - to a point, if it's done well.  However, Card is an extremist. He is virulently anti-gay to the point of ranting on his siet and everywhere else he can about gays 'destroying the world'. He uses a lot of the money he gets from his works to push anti-gay and other very far-Right agendas. So, he gets no money from me."
ImaginaryMonsters,34nbt7,Mudders_Milk_Man,6,Sun May 3 13:02:59 2015 UTC,I still can't see how making the world more fabulous looking is destroying it.
ImaginaryMonsters,34nbt7,AliasUndercover,1 point,Sun May 3 14:07:59 2015 UTC,"Do you have any source on him using ""a lot"" of his money to push anti-gay and other far-right agendas? Or is this just exagerating because you disagree with his stance on gay marriage? (I disagree with it as well, by the way, but I get a feeling you're being a bit dishonest here for the sake of outrage)  Funnily enough, I've never read any fantasy novels with as much sexual tension between male characters as his novels. Apart from perhaps Robin Hobb's Farseer trilogy.  Also, from the fact that you started ranting straight away about something completely off topic, I take it you never actually read the Ender's Game books. The political philosophy in those books have absolutely nothing to do with what you're ranting about."
ImaginaryMonsters,34nbt7,aperppu,6,Sun May 3 17:07:29 2015 UTC,"If you read through enough of Card's blogs and such, you'll find the source: Him. He is very proud of spending a lot of money on 'stopping' gays. He isn't just against gay marriage. He wants homosexuality to be a crime like in the good ol' days.   I have read the Ender's series. It's certainly well-crafted, as most of his stuff is. His homophobic and somewhat misogynistic views aren't expressed very strongly through that series, true, but it's not totally absent. Some of his other work is more obvious with his political bent."
ImaginaryMonsters,34nbt7,Mudders_Milk_Man,0,Sun May 3 18:26:40 2015 UTC,"It does seem I've been a bit ignorant of his statements through the years. I just did some further googling and found quite a lot of vile quotes from him. While googling I also found out that, while not as adamant and extreme as Card, Brandon Sanderson subscribe to quite homophobic beliefs as well. Not too surprising considering they're both Mormons.  But as I enjoy their books too much I'm going to keep giving them money. Oh well."
ImaginaryMonsters,34nbt7,aperppu,2,Sun May 3 20:09:37 2015 UTC,"Brandon Sanderson subscribe to quite homophobic beliefs as well.   What? No. From his own fucking blog:  I have changed my stance on gay marriage somewhat. After a great deal of soul searching, thought, and discussion, I now believe that the best way to approach this is to push for ALL state unions to be civil unions. I believe we should establish what the state grants a union—whether it be straight or gay—and apply those rights universally to all."
ImaginaryMonsters,34nbt7,DoctorDank,2,Mon May 4 14:04:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, while he's not for taking away anyones rights or opressing people, his stance towards homosexuality as a concept seems to remain the same. From the very same blog:  ""At the same time, I accept and sustain the leaders of the LDS church. I believe that a prophet of God has said that widespread legislation to approve gay marriage will bring pain and suffering to all involved. I trust those whom I have accepted as my spiritual leaders. I feel that what they have said is God’s will."""

ImaginaryMonsters,34nbt7,TheKronk,17,Sat May 2 19:07:00 2015 UTC,I never read or watched Dune. So...he's becoming one of the sand worm things? I don't understand what he is.
ImaginaryMonsters,34nbt7,kyew,21,Sat May 2 20:06:40 2015 UTC,Pretty much. He's also immortal and basically omniscient.
ImaginaryMonsters,34nbt7,phsyco,28,Sat May 2 20:12:40 2015 UTC,"In God Emperor of Dune, his prescience is so powerful that he willfully ignores, and or blinds himself, to his own visions of the future so he can have 'surprises' in his daily life again. He nearly gets his vestigial leg blasted off at one point because he had ignored his own premonitions, and his reaction to the whole episode was akin to 'Oh my goodness, I haven't had this much fun in centuries!'"
ImaginaryMonsters,34nbt7,velders01,12,Sat May 2 23:34:24 2015 UTC,"Because of his ""relative omniscience,"" he knew what he had to do to ensure humanity's survival, but he also knew it would take millenia of careful manipulation of the entire species. We're talking changing the gene pool, the social system, religion, etc... This isn't something he can leave to his children and progeny. The only way he could figure out how to live that long was to fuse with the famous Dune Sandworms, and become this monstrosity.   He calls himself the ""Apex Predator,"" he essentially makes himself the enemy that humanity has to overcome in order to even stand a chance of survival. It's quite a bit more complicated than what I wrote, but this is the gist of it.   I never even read sci-fi besides assigned work before the Dune Series, but ""God Emperor of Dune"" is probably one of my favorite books of all time simply for the philosophical insight that the God Emperor has with his thousands of years of observation."
ImaginaryMonsters,34nbt7,wlievens,3,Sun May 3 02:51:40 2015 UTC,"I read Messiah about twenty years ago, and Dune about ten years ago (makes no sense, I know...).  Can I read God Emperor of Dune without (re-)reading the three preceding books? Or does that make no sense at all."
ImaginaryMonsters,34nbt7,velders01,1 point,Sun May 3 06:51:01 2015 UTC,"I think it makes perfect sense actually. I think you're vastly overestimating people's memory. Most Game of Thrones readers had to go through nearly a decade lull between the 4th and 5th book, you think they remember squat besides the broader outlines?   Read a wiki summary of the first three books, and you're set for the 4th book, God Emperor, I'd say.   It's definitely not for everyone though. It's a completely different style from the ""adventure"" style prose in the 1st 3 books. In fact, this large book barely even has any traveling.   It's beautifully written, tragic, and I consider it high literature. Even if I weren't a fan of the content, I think I'd like reading it just because I enjoy good writing in general.   Hell, shoot me a pm if you have any questions at all while reading. I'll fill you in the best I can."

ImaginaryMonsters,34nbt7,NotANinja,3,Sun May 3 15:25:09 2015 UTC,I've heard the movie described as the absolute best book to movie translation of the thematic ideas of the original while also being one of the worst for keeping to the actual content of the book. This is a description I agree with.
ImaginaryMonsters,34nbt7,Findrin,16,Sun May 3 01:02:15 2015 UTC,"Spice does have drastic physical properties, such as in the navigators, but Leto's transformation is different. In Children of Dune, he lays in a cave where a bunch of creatures called Sand Makers (I think), basically baby sandworms, are crawling around. He lets them crawl over him and their, uh, excretions cause the transformation process. His transformation is not something just anyone can do. Paul could have done it, as the kwisatz haderach, and any Atreides of his line afterward."
ImaginaryMonsters,34nbt7,Heirophants-Omnibus,12,Sat May 2 20:50:30 2015 UTC,"Sand Makers   Sandtrout, but you got the rest right.   Paul could have done it, as the kwisatz haderach, and any Atreides of his line afterward.   There's an argument to be made that Paul couldn't have done it, either because he wasn't the KH (born one generation too early) and thus couldn't see that option, or was emotionally/mentally unwilling to take that path, or that he was stuck by the KH prophesy (he can't take that path because his son was meant to to walk that path)."
ImaginaryMonsters,34nbt7,phsyco,3,Sat May 2 21:38:10 2015 UTC,"Paul couldn't have done it...was emotionally/mentally unwilling to take that path, or that he was stuck by the KH prophesy (he can't take that path because his son was meant to to walk that path)   I was under the impression that it was a bit of both. He had the inklings of what the Golden Path was going to be, and he couldn't stand the thought of being responsible for such atrocities that would have to be endured because of it. It was only after Leto finds him and talks with him that he finally goes along with it, only because he understands that Humanity could not survive any other way. His final actions, more or less, helped pave the way for Leto's Path."
ImaginaryMonsters,34nbt7,NotANinja,2,Sat May 2 22:58:44 2015 UTC,"He was capable of doing it but refused the Golden Path, he was doing everything he could to break away from the future he saw when he walked out into the desert. Him and Leto discuss this, he tries to talk Leto out of it while Leto convinces him it must be done, in Children of Dune IIRC."
ImaginaryMonsters,34nbt7,TheSnacky,1 point,Sat May 2 23:41:59 2015 UTC,"They're either called Sandtrout or Little Makers, he got them mixed up a bit."
ImaginaryMonsters,34nbt7,JohntheShrubber,6,Sun May 3 01:30:48 2015 UTC,"You are closer to the mark than Froglok, but still not entirely correct. Leto's transformation isnt from the excretions of the Sandtrout, but that he lets them completely cover his body and their cilia dig into his skin and they make a symbiotic skin that lives and grows on him. It is his abilities as the Kwisatz Haderach that allow him to manipulate the hormones in his body to and not be killed by a spice overdose."
ImaginaryMonsters,34nbt7,Robotochan,4,Sat May 2 23:16:40 2015 UTC,"The Navigators aren't sandworms, they are just mutated by the spice. They have a level of prescient ability which is why they work as Navigators in that they can see where they are going.  Leto's power of super-prescience allows him to see a way that he can become a sandworm and see his plan for humanity through."
ImaginaryMonsters,34nbt7,ReaperOfTheLost,3,Sat May 2 23:01:38 2015 UTC,Well the real reason for his transformation is that he over saturates his blood with spice and fuses with the sand trout which are some part of the worm life cycle that makes no sense. So he's really more of a symbote.

ImaginaryMonsters,34nbt7,glorkcakes,3,Sun May 3 00:01:11 2015 UTC,I dont think any amount of time is long enough for spoilers man. People freak out about game of thrones spoilers and those books are pretty damn old too
ImaginaryMonsters,34nbt7,vaelroth,2,Sat May 2 22:20:31 2015 UTC,"True, but we don't have a current high-profile adaptation of Dune happening. If SyFy (ugh) were making further miniseries of the story, then I'd be just as wary of Dune spoilers as I would be wary of ASOIAF spoilers.  Since Game of Thrones is so high profile (HBO is serious business!), but the ASOIAF books are not so much- those who haven't read the books have good reason to be wary of spoilers. If the same situation applied to Dune, I think watchers would have equal validity in not wishing to be spoiled as GoT watchers do."

ImaginaryMonsters,34nbt7,crowbahr,23,Sat May 2 23:33:35 2015 UTC,"Since people are just downvoting without replying I'll shoot:  You never read more than 2 books if you do not remember this character as he is pivotal and the most talked about individual for the remaining series.   Leto Atreides II is also known as the God Emperor of Dune and is one of the two children of Paul (Muad'dib) Atreides and Chani. He's one of the central characters in the 3rd book (Children of Dune) and in the 3rd-4th books singlehandedly dictated the entire future of humanity for thousands of years to come, breaking them free from the chains and inevitable destruction of prescience. He lives a little over 3500 years as the sole ruler of mankind because of a symbiotic relationship between himself and the sandworm's reproductive vector: sandtrout. They form his skin and slowly the entirety of his being becomes more and more sandworm. He imparts a certain consciousness to each of the sandtrout, what he calls a ""Pearl of Conscious"" which means that the remaining worms of Dune all carry/are revenants of the God Emperor.   His ""Golden Path"" is carried out and set in motion by the revenants, his manipulation of key groups (Bene Gesserit, Bene  Tleilax and in part his Fish Speakers) and the maneuverings he made through prescience.   It's fine to have watched the movies and have that be your only experience with Dune (though you're missing out) but there's no need to claim you've read more that you obviously haven't given the character is as core as (and more discussed than) Muad'dib in the remaining books."

ImaginaryMonsters,33jmnf,Ihavenospecialskills,1 point,Thu Apr 23 22:28:28 2015 UTC,Anthro is not another term for furry. Anthro is short for anthropomorphic which means having human characteristics. Furries might be primarily interested in anthro but that doesn't mean it works the other way around. Art can be anthro without being considered furry art. Just like how a car can be red but not everything that's red is a car.  Source: I have many friends who draw furry art and have interacted with furry type people for many years. I've never been interested in it but that was the side effect of the community that I was pulled into.

Also some Dark Souls bosses are near to and even normal human size.  Plus there shouldn't be a lot of dying if you're good at the game."

ImaginaryMonsters,3323di,One_Giant_Nostril,72,Sat Apr 18 19:52:37 2015 UTC,"Christopher Balaskas' deviantART gallery.  The artist wrote a backstory for these creatures: The long-lived Dunewalkers puncture the surface of the desert floor with their long, hollow legs, siphoning off large reservoirs of massive sub-surface insect swarms. By controlling the release of it's hot digestive gases, the Dunewalker maintains its buoyancy, counterbalancing its enormous weight like a hot-air balloon. Bacterial colonies feed upon these nutrient-rich gas clouds and attract airborne insects, who are then consumed by flocks of desert birds whose droppings in turn attract the sub-surface swarms, completing this ancient symbiotic cycle of the wastes."

They growl, howl, and whimper like regular coyotes, but hiss, rattle, and inject venom into their prey like snakes. Their bodies are mostly dog-like, covered in a combination of fur and scales, their heads and tails, however, are more like that of a rattlesnake, including fangs and a forked tongue. Night stalkers' right eyes are blue with a round pupil, while their left eyes are yellow with an elliptical pupil, like a rattlesnake's. They lay eggs, like a snake, which can be used to prepare Mushroom Cloud. Their blood is also used as an ingredient in antivenom and hydra.  Night stalkers nest in caves across the Mojave Wasteland and can be found both inside the cave or in the nearby area. Packs of night stalkers can be frequently seen hunting at night east of Morning Star cavern near the nest with the radscorpion queen, south of the broc flower cave, and northwest of the cap counterfeiting shack.

ImaginaryMonsters,32v4xe,Gosset,4,Fri Apr 17 14:23:41 2015 UTC,"Elesh belongs to the  The Flesh Singularity: The Sect of Total Unity. The most powerful sect amongst the Machine Orthodoxy. Who believe the following:  ""One sect of the Orthodoxy is founded on the ideal of the rejection of the selfish ego and the total unification of all things. Their twisted, almost naïve conception of the perfect community is the elimination of all barriers between individuals. The Phyrexian tendency toward literalism takes this to a frightening extreme: Phyrexians of this sect seek to literally connect all beings to one another and to become a single, vast, organic-and-metal organism, the end-state of which they call, among other names, the Flesh Singularity. (The term ""flesh"" here means both organic and inorganic matter; like most Phyrexians, they don't distinguish between living and dead things as potential materials for their form of life.) When all life is literally attached to all other life—by sutured skin, riveted metal, woven fur, whatever—only then will true, perfect unity be achieved.""  But also have the following traits:  ""Dermatophobia. Phyrexians of the Flesh Singularity sect seem to have a special hatred for, or fear of, skin. To them, the skin (or whatever a creature has as its outer covering) is the ultimate boundary, the wall that divides the self from the outside world, and individuals from one another. Many deaths at the hands of Phyrexians of the Machine Orthodoxy involve brutal, almost ritualized flaying. It's rare for these Phyrexians to leave a victim's skin whole when compleating it; they often replace nearly all of a creature's former hide with glossy, porcelain-like armor or some other material that is less emblematic of discrete individuality.""  The blessing of the Father of Machines would be to Phyresy and convert the individuals and eventually join all organisms amongst the sect into a singly being. The motto 'All will be one' is rather literal for the Machine Orthodoxy and the Flesh Singularity especially. So though you're qoute is correct, they must unite the flesh, flaying is a big ritual part of the 'joining'."

On a corrupted mirrodin it makes sense for the Suture priests to have corrupted the influence of Bringer (the cards effect is every time a creature enters the battle field under your control you may gain 1 life, every time a creature enter the battlifield under an opponents control you may have them lose 1 life) to give life to loyal phyrexians and punish the dissenters."

ImaginaryMonsters,32rc65,Minister-Syn,3,Thu Apr 16 07:12:24 2015 UTC,"It doesn't completely resemble it but since I read the description of Polpovirs just yesterday, it reminded me of them:  All the creatures you've read about in this book are nothing compared to the Polpovir. Barely the size of a man, what they lack in size and strength, they make up for in numbers and terrifying viciousness. Their lower halves are a mass of tentacles like an octopus or squid, but more numerous. The tentacles are long, black whips with suction cups on the underside and small thorny barbs on the top. The sheer number of tentacles gives them frightening speed when walking on land, pulling themselves forward almost as fast as a running horse. While they vaguely resemble a human from the waist up, any extended examination proves how wrong that assumption is. Long, stringy black hair falls from the top of their heads to cover a face taken directly from a nightmare. A wide, gaping mouth, cuts across the bottom of its head from ear to ear, full of wicked dagger-like teeth. Two large round eyes are sunken into its head, black as coal, shining with a malevolent fire. A small antenna protrudes from the middle of its forehead, ending in a small nodule that can glow with an eerie blue light. One can imagine a sailor on the deck of his ship at night, looking out across the black water, blood freezing as countless lights appear beneath the surface, rising toward him as the Polpovir swarm upward. Because they seem to be more octopus than man, they can collapse in on themselves, fitting into spaces no person should be able to. The smallest crack in a hull, the slightest separation between boards offers them entrance. It is not unknown for them to slaughter an entire crew from hold up to deck by infiltrating the ship from underneath. Fortunately they do not seem to have spread too far outside of the archipelago, but there may come a day when Polpovir attacks become commonplace.    ”"

ImaginaryMonsters,32ogfd,ColiflowerEar,3,Wed Apr 15 13:00:12 2015 UTC,Finally someone put it into words.  Do you have anymore of these 'supranormal' aliens?
ImaginaryMonsters,32ogfd,Greatmooze,2,Wed Apr 15 18:17:07 2015 UTC,Indeed.  Supranormal is best normal.

ImaginaryMonsters,32ogfd,CoffeeAndKarma,3,Wed Apr 15 18:56:18 2015 UTC,"As someone else said, it was a creature called a Celestial. From my understanding, they are god-like entities in the Marvel Universe (at least from our perspective). I don't really know too much more, personally, but this link might be helpful for you if you want to learn more.  Of course, that's for the comics, and the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a little different, but it should shed some light on the concept."
ImaginaryMonsters,32ogfd,real_recognize_feel,2,Wed Apr 15 21:41:48 2015 UTC,It was the skull of a Celestial.
ImaginaryMonsters,32ogfd,revofire,1 point,Wed Apr 15 20:34:02 2015 UTC,Crazy stuff. Imagine the size of the planets and their weapons to have been so big. They say they were over 2000 feet tall but that's BS because the size of the skull seems too big for them to be that size...
ImaginaryMonsters,32ogfd,Beardoski,2,Wed Apr 15 21:27:20 2015 UTC,"They were powerful enough to change their size at will. They are so powerful that when Thanos was somewhat able to understand the power of the Infinity Gems, they fought him with everything they had by throwing entire planet systems at him in order to save the universe. They could create, shape & destroy life whenever & however they wanted to. Time was no issue to them. Yet they still werent powerful enough to beat Thanos with the Infinity Gauntlet. They are pretty much gods to most gods. Godly engineers so to speak. So, if a Celestial ever came looking for you personally, you either fucked up BIG TIME or something special will happen."
ImaginaryMonsters,32ogfd,revofire,1 point,Wed Apr 15 22:13:31 2015 UTC,Will they focus on them in a next movie?
ImaginaryMonsters,32ogfd,Beardoski,1 point,Thu Apr 16 00:23:00 2015 UTC,"I doubt it...too much info and wrong timeline. This Marvel Universe seems to be on the plain side with less going on. The main conecept toward Thanos carrying out his conquest of using the Infinity Gauntlet is to appease his love of Death itself. He dedicates it to her...the travesty of ending half of all life in the universe in an instant by simply snapping his fingers, literally. But his dedication reaches no avail after he kills off all of the Marvel heroes. So he brings them back to life or existence and calls them out and challenges EVERYONE to physical combat to see if that will work. Literally everyone you can think of comes to fight Thanos and he beats them. The last person that he challenges is Eternity itself, and thats where he messes up. He beats Eternity and becomes Eternity itself...which means, he becomes one with the universe, leaving his physical body vulnerable along with the Infinity Gauntlet. The next movie will probably involve Thanos becoming aware that there is a force capable of opposing him once he searches for greater power. The Infinity War will most likely involve the Avengers and others but no larger than life celestial beings, yet. What I mean by beings is the elders, like The Stranger, Kronos (Thanos grandfather), The Living Tribunal, Master Order and Lord Chaos, Love & Hate, Infinity and Eternity, Galactus, etc. Sorry for rambling but it just goes to show that when shit hits the fan, the Celestials wont come when the shit hits the fan hard and sprays the room."
ImaginaryMonsters,32ogfd,revofire,1 point,Thu Apr 16 01:09:19 2015 UTC,"Ah... Well it looks like Marvel and everything else is going to shit ever since Disney acquired, so there's nothing to look forward to anyway."
ImaginaryMonsters,32ogfd,Beardoski,1 point,Thu Apr 16 01:34:31 2015 UTC,"Not really, its all just for the kiddies. More eye candy than anything. I just like the whole ""bringing the character to life"" concept. Now that the Vision is coming for the Avengers 2, I just want to see him of all things. The movies were heading in the right direction when Iron Man first came out, but they all went to shit with movies referring to triumph and courage and the ""good guys"" always winning. Marvel comics had my attention when I was younger because the stories had heroes who were flawed. Iron Man being an alchoholic, Thor overplaying his god level and almost always killing himself to prove his worth. Captain America realizing that there will always be a ""bad guy"" that will get away. Everyone else that will come out in the Avengers 2 has lots of baggage that will never be addressed. What really annoys me with this whole Fox/Sony and Marvel issue, is that Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch will no longer be referred to as Magnetos kids or mutants for that matter. They even went back to change adjust new storylines in the comics to ""set it in stone"" so to speak. But like I said, its just eye candy now...the story doesnt matter anymore to the target audience.  Edit: What I mean by things being changed in storylines and making no sense is that Ultron was created by Hank Pym and became self aware. Hank Pym was also a better engineer/scientist/creator than Tony Stark and Reed Richards. Eternity himself said that Hank Pym was his most special aspect because whatever he could think of and plan to make was possible. He could turn his fantasies or nightmares into a reality. So thats another thing that really annoys me in this next Avengers movie because Tony Stark ""creates"" Ultron...pfft...I cringed when I found that out. Oh well."

ImaginaryMonsters,32awnj,Sqeaky,1 point,Sun Apr 12 21:28:45 2015 UTC,"I hadn't thought like that yet. But judging by the debris in the background this is an action with stuff till collapsing behind the creature.  It may or may nor be intelligent, it may or may not be placable, but it certainly is big.  That is also, not the posture of a man about to drop is sword. That sword is in a common middle guard, but it is too far to the swordsman's right to guard much and that shield is a too low to be readied. If anything that is the posture of a man momentarily limp from surprise.  Here is what I think is happened:  A brave man heard the raucus timbre of stone and steel crashing nearby. Could be a tower collapse or raiders, so the man moved into action to help; it was the only course of action. He just rounded to corner to aid in quelling the unfathomable commotion. His jaw went limp. His arms slackened and his legs carried him forward slowly, as if they remembered his previous goal. Then he just stood in disbelief. He was seeing a beast of nightmare and legend. The monster finished decimating the building across the courtyard, then turned his way. He and the Dragon locked eyes."

ImaginaryMonsters,329op2,ghostdate,5,Sun Apr 12 03:57:45 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem for me is the size relationships. The town is tiny as fuck, yet the buildings on the beasts have clearly defined windows and doorways, so the single building on the beast is bigger than the entire town, yet much further away. I can't tell if it's intentional or not. Also, the rider/scout thing makes no sense where it is. I think it would've been better if the view was from within the town, and you were seeing the beasts approaching. Maybe have the rider on some overhang or ledge of a tower. I think that would have been a more cinematic shot.   Idk, I don't think the composition is very good here. Looks like he maybe tried to use the golden spiral as a guide, but it looks messed up.

Yearwalking  A complex form of divination in Swedish folk tradition.. The tradition of year walking is predominantly recorded from Southern Sweden, and was usually practised at Christmas or New Year’s Eve. Different regions of Sweden give contrasting explanations for how this was accomplished. From Småland and Blekinge, the year walker was supposed to lock himself up in a dark room, without speaking to anyone nor taste food or drink. At midnight, he (or she) walked to the parish church – or a cluster of different churches – and circled it three times (or more), then he (or she) blew into the church’s key hole. With this the year walker temporarily lost his (or her) Christianity. When this happened, supernatural beings appeared and challenged the year walker. If the walker managed these tests, glimpses of the future could appear; either in vision or by sounds. These could be interpreted as glimpses of what would happen the following year.    If someone (in an regular manner) had gone Year Walking for seven years and on the last night, met a mounted man, who had a 'runkavle' in the mouth, and if the Year Walker was then brave enough and strong enough to snatch this, **he or she became known as wise. That is, he/she had gained knowledge of all hidden things and could see into the future, without again having to do a Year Walk.    from Wikipedia  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%85rsg%C3%A5ng    I have have become wise...  oh, and the game is totally amazing!"

ImaginaryMonsters,328li4,ginkomortus,2,Sat Apr 11 15:39:06 2015 UTC,"If I may offer some constructive criticism, I would recommend getting some watercolor pencils to do the sketch, so any lines you don't want can be absorbed into the body of color, and any lines you do want can be done as shading with a color darker/different  than the main color.   Unless that's the style you were going for, because if that's the case you did a brilliant job of making sure it gave texture to the painting without detracting from it, as the main areas of color such as the wings, head, and body are pleasant to look at and not too ""muddy"" the way some things can get if they've been gone over too many times.   Very pretty!"
ImaginaryMonsters,328li4,Flyamanita,1 point,Sun Apr 12 05:55:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot! I don't really know much about art technique or what mediums work to produce which effects.

ImaginaryMonsters,31zhag,GetESCP,1 point,Fri Apr 10 03:13:34 2015 UTC,I've gotten used to it for the most part. For me it always happens when I'm sleeping on my back.

Or that I'm hanging upside down by my feet

ImaginaryMonsters,31zhag,xencosti,24,Fri Apr 10 15:52:01 2015 UTC,"I haven't had this happen recently, but for a while I had sleep paralysis/night terrors so bad that I was afraid to go to sleep. One thing I noticed, one thing that helped me realize that what I was seeing wasn't happening, was that everything was weirdly well lit. It was always like intense moonlight was entering my room, or like a glow was coming from somewhere. It was always just bright enough to see the spider crawling towards my face, the vines growing out of my ceiling, the face stretching out of the wall, or the shadowy figure peaking it's head around my door.   These night terrors often involved me running out of my room from whatever I was seeing, since I was rarely paralyzed, and when I would finally snap out of it in the bathroom or in the kitchen I would realize that what I was seeing couldn't have been real because the moon wasn't out that night, or the light in the hallway isn't that bright or that color.   Also because it's very unlikely my lamp could turn into a robot snake and try to kill me."
ImaginaryMonsters,31zhag,I_R_RILEY,11,Thu Apr 9 17:28:40 2015 UTC,"lamp could turn into a robot snake   Oh wow, someone else gets these nightmares too. Used to happen with pretty much any light fixture my brain could come up with. Stopped at about grade school age though, thank god."

ImaginaryMonsters,31zhag,zeldakong64,3,Thu Apr 9 15:50:30 2015 UTC,"If it's really bad then maybe? Mine have mostly gone away. I'll have them occasionally, but never as bad as I used to. When they were truly bad and ruining my sleep schedule I thought about seeing a doctor, but never did. I don't even know what I'd look for.   I often wonder if they are stress related because mine mostly disappeared after I moved out of an old place and into a new one that I find more comfortable. Within a few months they were mostly gone.   I seem to have mostly grown out of them, maybe that will happen to you too."
ImaginaryMonsters,31zhag,I_R_RILEY,3,Thu Apr 9 16:49:22 2015 UTC,"It's just always been there really from a young age. I've always been a fairly anxious person so maybe there's a correlation there.

I've l've gone from my childhood home, to a new house, to college dorms, to an apartment... it seems to definitely have to do with me and I haven't really outgrown it.

I haven't had one in years and years now, probably after my mid 20's, they've all but disappeared.   Honestly, I used to be intensely religious, having been schooled in a fundamentalist baptist school from 1st to 8th grade, hearing about demons, fire & brimstone content. Now that I've virtually purged religious dogma, perhaps that could be the reason for the sleep paralysis going away?   I'm in an incredibly stressful position right now, but it's just life, work, growing older, more responsibilities, etc.. It's kind of sad, but I think I might have been even more stressed out when i was younger, and that seems to coincide with the frequency of sleep paralysis during various periods of my life."

I've found the best way to stop it from full blown episodes is to focus on moving just my feet. They don't move but by focusing hard enough after a few seconds my brain finally picks up on it and I 'wake' back up.

ImaginaryMonsters,31zhag,Roukiepants,2,Thu Apr 9 17:40:41 2015 UTC,"I've been getting sleep paralysis for about four years now. For me, it's always auditory (and sometimes sensory), but never visual. Very often, I hallucinate the sound of someone coming in through the door (even though I know the door is locked). It's very scary because I can't tell if it's real and someone's broken in—and, of course, I can't move or make a sound, or even open my eyes in most cases.   Sometimes I just hallucinate people talking, usually people I know. Often their voices come from odd places, like right outside the window on a second storey.   I most often hallucinate amy boyfriend's voice and him touching me or moving in the bed beside me (even if he's not actually there). I still feel terrified and filled with doom, but the hallucination is comforting. The panic is separate and, so far as I can tell, caused by nothing at all (except possibly by inability to move or make a sound).  The hallucinations are always repetitive. When the hallucination completes itself (like my boyfriend waking up, touching me, and asking if I'm OK), the exact same hallucination starts again. This continues ad nauseum until I finally snap out of the paralysis. It's really freaky, and it's very hard to make myself realize that I'm just imagining it; it really feels real."

ImaginaryMonsters,31zhag,mygrapefruit,6,Thu Apr 9 22:45:31 2015 UTC,"There's a state of dreaming where you're in seemingly full awareness, you're able to get up from your bed, move through the house and have quite a lot of clarity.    However, none of it is real. It's still a dream, and the longer it continues the further this reality around you breaks down. That's when the lighting of your house gets red, alarms sound, phones ring or weird sightings appear and more and more strange things start happening.    It's unlike an actual dream state where you're readily accept the strange and inconsistent narrative and where you roll wilt the weird events. In 'ordinary' dreams you actually believe you're the captain of a cruise ship, or that you're in forest or in some different moment in time past or future.  Neither is it an out of body experience. For all you know you're awake and simple checking some noise you've heard or a window you've let open or something.    So hence, an unaware state of lucid dreaming."

I could then proceed to freely move, but the world would get distorted the farther I got from my bed.

It's always terrifying, but after enough times I'm able to calm down quickly after the episode is done. Never controllable, you really just have to snap out of it and things are back to normal.

ImaginaryMonsters,31zhag,funktion,3,Thu Apr 9 21:15:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not /u/funktion but I used to have them often and still do whenever I try to lucid dream. The first time is scariest. It's still scary the times after but it does get less scary because you know it's not real. The demons and shit I'd see were always the same too. They'd always be standing in the corner or the corner of the ceiling upside down.   Controlling what I see has never been a thing for me. And yes, it always feels evil."
ImaginaryMonsters,31zhag,RicochetRuby,2,Thu Apr 9 19:10:44 2015 UTC,"What do you do to try to lucid dream?  I get both lucid dreams and sleep paralysis. I've been getting lucid dreams (maybe about 1-2 times a week on average) for as long as I can remember, but sleep paralysis started only a few years ago and is much more rare.  For me, they're totally different beasts. Lucid dreaming happens strictly at the end of a full night's sleep; I'll have a normal dream, I'll gradually become aware that I'm dreaming, and from there I gradually wake up. But sleep paralysis only happens when I try to take a nap, but it's a fitful nap; I'm too tired to get up, but I'm struggling to get into deep sleep, too.   And, of course, they feel totally different. Lucid dreaming is really and truly dreaming; I am not in any way aware of the real world, it's fantastical (like any other dream), and my memory of it fades almost immediately upon waking. But with sleep paralysis, I'm not in any dream world, it very plain (though usually terrifying), and it registers in my memory like a real event (which makes it traumatizing in a longterm way).  Lucid dreams aren't always pleasant; when I was younger, I was particularly plagued with lucid nightmares that I tried desperately (and unsuccessfully) to wake myself from, by doing things like hitting myself or trying to pee (hoping that if I peed in a dream, I'd wet the bed in real life and it would wake me up). But, of course, I was only dreaming about doing these things—not doing them in real life—so I couldn't wake up.  But even the worst lucid nightmare is better than sleep paralysis, in my experience. Not necessarily in the moment (I've had some really scary lucid nightmares, like of my mom trying to murder me), but in the longer run, it's nice being able to wake up in the end and forget it."
ImaginaryMonsters,31zhag,Nausved,1 point,Thu Apr 9 19:22:17 2015 UTC,"It's hard to explain for me. When I try to lucid dream, I lay on my back and think about it. I tell myself that I'm going to have a lucid dream. It's easy since I have experience with it. Someone that's never done it probably won't have it happen to them.   Anyway, I tell myself that while I start thinking about this feeling I'd get when I knew I was going to have sleep paralysis. It feels like I'm slipping away from the world. Everything feels super far away, kinda like in video games when you turn the FOV (field of view) all the way up. My hands start to feel really small too. It's probably the most unsettling thing ever but I got used to it.   So once I start doing all that, I try to fall asleep while the feeling is there. 2/4 of the time, nothing happens and I just sleep. 1/4 of the time, I actually lucid dream and its great. Once the dream starts, I actually have to realize its a dream before it turns lucid. The other 1/4, I'll have sleep paralysis."
ImaginaryMonsters,31zhag,RicochetRuby,1 point,Thu Apr 9 21:18:27 2015 UTC,"Huh, that's so strange. So you just launch directly into a lucid dream from being awake?  Is it like the sensation of falling asleep while thinking about something complicated? (I do this a lot, and sometimes have the self-awareness to realize that what I'm thinking has stopped making sense. It's especially fun carrying on a conversation while falling asleep, because it rapidly turns into hilarious gibberish for the other person.)  How long do your lucid dreams last? For me, lucid dreaming seems to be a step on the way to waking up, so they usually don't last as long as I'd like. My favorite part, actually, is right before I realize I'm dreaming—when, instead, I've realized I have certain superpowers (like levitating or insane jumping), but I still think it's all real. When I realize I'm dreaming, I usually regret the realization, and I try really hard to go back to non-lucid dreaming (while retaining all the cool stuff I can do).   So far, I have not succeeded in going from lucid to non-lucid dreaming. It only ever happens in the other direction."
ImaginaryMonsters,31zhag,Nausved,1 point,Fri Apr 10 05:14:22 2015 UTC,"No, I don't launch myself right into it. I'll sleep for however long until I actually have a dream. That's when I'll be able to lucid dream. They never last long enough for me to do everything I want to do in a dream though :("
ImaginaryMonsters,31zhag,RicochetRuby,2,Fri Apr 10 05:23:46 2015 UTC,"It gets better because you know what it is. But I still get scared at times. I think that has something to do with chemicals being released bc you can't move so your brain kinda goes into panic mode. I can usually wake myself up depending on how ""stuck"" I am.  Sometimes no weird demons come. Or they are there but I always keep my eyes closed. Out of sight out of mind haha."

Basically I had fallen asleep and was in the ""between awake, between asleep"" stage that you usually don't remember.   I toss and turn a lot in my sleep, so in my semi-conscious body flipped me over to look at the wall beside my bed automatically (I had no control over this movement) and beside my head literally arms length from me sitting on my pillow was this creature. It was very slim with long limbs and was kind of curled up like Gollum from the Lord of the Rings and was a deep green colour, and its body was tattooed in gold designs.   I remember distinctly that it was faceless, or at least looked that way because, even though it was only about 3 feet from me it was very hard to see the detail because it was wrapped in shadow as if it was producing its own darkness to hide in. Anyway, when it comes to fight or flight instincts I usually find I choose fight so I struck out at the creature but my arm went through it and it vanished instantly.

We live together, but it's only when he's away that it attacks.  The one exception, he was asleep beside me. I tried to alert him, but I couldn't move or make a sound—or even open my eyes. The only thing I could control was my breath, so I just breathed as hard and fast as I could until the sound woke him up."

It's actually one of the things you encounter on the journey of learning how to enter lucid dreaming regularly.  Also you can get out of sleep paralysis as well, but it takes practice to be able to assert domination over being able to move your muscles."

ImaginaryMonsters,31zhag,giles91,2,Thu Apr 9 16:53:45 2015 UTC,"I generally experience sleep paralysis at least once a month, though there have been times where I've had it about every other night. That being said, I've never had the hallucinations others seem to experience during. I've always described it as being ""like my mind wakes up without my body.""  What makes it truly horrifying though is that it almost always only happens to me when my breathing is obstructed like if I turn in my sleep so my face is against my pillow and I'm struggling for breath. So basically it only occurs when I'm going to be afraid that I might actually die."
ImaginaryMonsters,31zhag,Warped00,2,Thu Apr 9 16:56:34 2015 UTC,Happens to me all the time.. Use to be really scary but now aware of when it's happening. Same hallucinations every time too!

ImaginaryMonsters,31zhag,Merlord,2,Thu Apr 9 13:08:53 2015 UTC,"Im curious because this never happens to me, I sleep like a dead log. Everytime lucid dreaming or sleep paralysis come up, there always seems to be some super spoopy lady involved, is there a connection or is that just a common fear? My brother has experianced this and says hes dreamt of a very long scary woman drooling above his face, jaws outstretched."
ImaginaryMonsters,31zhag,Warped00,2,Thu Apr 9 14:50:06 2015 UTC,"Sleep paralysis is more common if your sleep cycles are messed up, I tend to get mine when sleeping in way past when I'm supposed to.   The 3spoopy5me lady isn't always there, but it is very common in sleep paralysis to sense a 'malevolent agent'. In waking life, this is that feeling that you're not alone, and is caused by the senses picking up clues that you might not notice consciously, like movement in your periphery, a change in light, barely audible sounds etc. In sleep paralysis, that feeling happens automatically, and causes your hallucinations to take shape. Your hallucinations act much like dreams: they take the shape of whatever you think they might be. For example, you start to feel that spooky presence, and you think to yourself ""Maybe its a monster"", and what do you know, you start hallucinating a monster in your room."

It wasn't like people said it was though, I sat up sideways with my weight on my elbow and I wanted to move my shoulder and turn my head but I could only barely move my upper body. I was facing a clock so I knew it wasn't a dream (because apparently those don't work in dreams). All that went through my head during those long 4 minutes was wanting to jump out my window due to the fear of becoming mentally ill or something.

Idk what word to use to describe it but i feel the hallucinations are some way geared towards my beliefs because I don't believe in demons but I do believe in the possibility of aliens and commonly have hallucinations about being abducted and stuff of the sort, also home invasions while asleep and the burglar is in my room.

ImaginaryMonsters,31yc01,TheFluffinator_,2,Thu Apr 9 03:49:50 2015 UTC,"I think I've settled on using FATE. It's heavily customizable, so I can give each cryptid the powers it deserves based on its mythology.  EDIT: oh, you're from the FATE subreddit, so I guess you knew that. The current plan is to design the base agents, and then take turns writing and running missions throughout the group. Along the way, depending on how the missions go, players will be able to recruit and ""unlock"" new cryptic-agents to be used in the future sessions. So far the only ""rule"" that I've come up with is that a player can't choose the same agent to play as two sessions in a row."

I don't know why, but I've always thought Rodan to be the most believable creature in the Godzilla universe - a monster that could perhaps appear one day, owing to it's roots in the Pterodactyl line...  The artist has a big write-up on this monster here."
ImaginaryMonsters,31rygj,cocoram,5,Tue Apr 7 18:41:36 2015 UTC,I really hope they go the direction of this artist's renditions in the movies. Rodan and Biolante look fucking awesome.
ImaginaryMonsters,31rygj,hmatmotu,2,Wed Apr 8 06:37:07 2015 UTC,"He is essentially just a daikaiju-sized Pteranodon, he's one of a few of Toho's monster line-up that is a scaled-up version of a different creature, and the others' counterparts are far far tinier, so I can definitely see how you'd find Rodan believable."
ImaginaryMonsters,31rygj,ZanThrax,15,Wed Apr 8 14:28:30 2015 UTC,Christ. How big is Rodan supposed to be anyhow? That jet that he's about to eat should be around 60' long. That makes Rodan's head somewhere in the area of 360' long.
ImaginaryMonsters,31rygj,ENKC,12,Tue Apr 7 23:51:37 2015 UTC,It varies from 50m-100m tall in the films. There's talk of him/her/it being in Godzilla 2 (the American one).
ImaginaryMonsters,31rygj,ZanThrax,3,Wed Apr 8 02:56:24 2015 UTC,"Okay, so it's just this art that's crazy big."
ImaginaryMonsters,31rygj,ENKC,11,Wed Apr 8 03:08:07 2015 UTC,There's a trend towards larger and more 'realistic' kaiju now with newer films like Godzilla 2014 and Pacific Rim. It wouldn't surprise me if this is close to Rodan's scale in its next appearance.
ImaginaryMonsters,31rygj,Calackyo,3,Wed Apr 8 04:27:23 2015 UTC,"but speaking realistically, this thing would never be able to fly."
ImaginaryMonsters,31rygj,ENKC,15,Wed Apr 8 10:58:40 2015 UTC,Definitely. Kaiju flat out laugh in the face of physics. At least they look more natural now than the 50s rubber suits.
ImaginaryMonsters,31rygj,TommBomBadil,1 point,Wed Apr 8 11:04:49 2015 UTC,Godzilla was originally @ 160' (50M) tall in the 50's. The 2014 Godzilla was the largest ever on film at 350' (107M) tall.  I think Rodan here is a bit larger than that.
ImaginaryMonsters,31rygj,hmatmotu,1 point,Wed Apr 22 20:06:46 2015 UTC,Rodan is usually about as tall as Godzilla.
ImaginaryMonsters,31rygj,Kayvanian,6,Wed Apr 8 14:29:16 2015 UTC,"Not knowing who Rodan is, at first I thought Rodan was about the same size as the jet in the foreground, flying very close by - and the faraway jet was way off in the distance.  Then I read this comment, and...oh my god..."

He was a minor figure in Greek mythology, often referred to, but rarely appearing in person.  His equivalent in Roman mythology is Mors or Letus/Letum, and he is sometimes identified erroneously with Orcus (Orcus himself had a Greek equivalent in the form of Horkos, God of the Oath).  He is associated with other Greek personifications including such as Geras  (Old Age), Oizys (Suffering), Moros (Doom), Apate (Deception), Momus (Blame), Eris (Strife), Nemesis (Retribution) and the Stygian boatman Charon."

ImaginaryMonsters,30t310,willyscoot,7,Mon Mar 30 16:58:57 2015 UTC,Yep. Same thing I thought. I don't think I ever saw the Foresworn build anything in tree's since they were contained within the Reach and I don't really remember it having very many tree's. But it's been awhile since I've played it. Otherwise the style of dress is pretty similar. If that was a Hagraven they were bringing him to I'd say it was.

ImaginaryMonsters,30q7ol,One_Giant_Nostril,3,Sun Mar 29 19:35:39 2015 UTC,"Here's Meseldžija's blogspot and website  The artist says:    When I showed this painting for the first time, a few persons responded by asking: ""Where did they get those furs?"" Somebody else commented: ""I think you should be aware that giants would have to have a very different muscular and skeletal structure, otherwise they would be crashed under their own weight.""  When it comes to having a ""proper"" experience of art that deals with mythological themes, I can say the following - before entering a mythological realm, which is a place situated deep within the human psyche (for the Unconscious is the birthplace of myth), one is required to leave one's usual logic and rational thinking behind. It's of no use there, for these ""imaginary"" worlds have their own reality, their own laws, and their own logic. Therefore, use your imagination and harness your dreams."

Part of my design process for creatures involves a rough sketch, and as a big fan of this subreddit I figured I might as well share. I also wrote a blog post about how the Fulminan Demon came to be created as part of writing a short story, which you can read here if you're interested. I am by no means as skilled an artist as most of the people whose work is featured on this subreddit, but I do draw a lot of these simple sketches as part of my worldbuilding. If anyone would like to see any more, let me know. Especially if you like the blog post, since I had a lot of fun writing it and would be happy to write about some other creatures I've imagined. Thanks!"

All of the art pieces give off a new feeling, and every single one is, for lack of a better term, the right feeling. I don't know if that even made sense but... Your work just astonishes me. I really don't have any idea how to express what I feel when I see, well, any of these! Can't wait to see them framed and hung up around my house! Sorry if I'm babbling but seriously... Goddamn this artwork is just what I've been wanting for years. This is the only time I've had an auditory reaction to art. I'm tired so I'll stop before I explode but honestly man... Holy fucking shit these are good."
ImaginaryMonsters,2zl138,MaryJaneandMolly,2,Fri Mar 20 03:16:32 2015 UTC,don't bother trying to explain it man. each of them is an expression of something in the back of my mind that's unexpressable in words and I am willing to bet it's the same or similar to what you're feeling. that's what I love about art. it lets you make these subconscious connections with people that nobody would be aware of otherwise.

ImaginaryMonsters,2zl138,drudy222,7,Thu Mar 19 16:35:29 2015 UTC,My only issue is the shadows dont match the sun :(
ImaginaryMonsters,2zl138,drudy222,4,Thu Mar 19 19:16:26 2015 UTC,"rays from the sun are (effectively) parallel because of its distance from the earth so the shadows would be straight up and down if the sun was right in the middle like that. if the light source were a lot closer, they'd be diagonal. I think. I don't know maybe im wrong but it was easier to paint them up and down :p"
ImaginaryMonsters,2zl138,drudy222,3,Thu Mar 19 19:49:08 2015 UTC,"Sure, they're physically parallel. These are parallel too.  As are these (really)."

ImaginaryMonsters,2zl138,slayerofthepoonhorde,2,Thu Mar 19 22:05:13 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply man. The main reason I ask is honestly I think we have similar styles. I tend to use silhouettes a lot too. And one of the most common themes I try to use is wonder. Although I have never really thought about it that way. Thanks for putting that into words.

ImaginaryMonsters,2zapdy,mrninja101,22,Tue Mar 17 00:37:43 2015 UTC,This must be something to do with sleep paralysis
ImaginaryMonsters,2zapdy,aldrchase,14,Tue Mar 17 04:16:15 2015 UTC,"it's one of the images used for sleep paralysis on wikipedia. It's also inspired by what people used to think sleep paralysis was, a demon siting on your chest."
ImaginaryMonsters,2zapdy,mr-nobe,9,Tue Mar 17 06:46:54 2015 UTC,"For further clarification: A mare is a kind of demon. So originally 'nightmare' meant the demon causing bad dreams/sleep paralysis, but the meaning shifted to the bad dreams themselves."
ImaginaryMonsters,2zapdy,isorun,3,Tue Mar 17 07:59:43 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  I just looked it up, and apparently it's just a coincidence that ""mare"" is the word for both a demon and a female horse.  They come from similar-sounding, but different root words.  When I was a kid, I had been taught that the term ""nightmare"" came from the concept of a demon horse that causes bad dreams.  Turns out it's just a homonym."
ImaginaryMonsters,2zapdy,Eat_a_Bullet,2,Wed Mar 18 00:45:15 2015 UTC,"AFAIK this is more than just ""what people used to think"". Your sleepy brain don't understand what's happening when you cannot move, so you start to hallucinate. So people saw, or at least felt, the demon holding them down, and some scientists speculate that this is also what has happened with people who have Alien Abduction stories."
ImaginaryMonsters,2zapdy,KnowledgeRuinsFun,2,Tue Mar 17 13:25:30 2015 UTC,"I forget the term for it, but when some people experience sleep paralysis it's accompanied by the absolute certainty that there's someone else in the room who wants to harm you.  Even if the person is aware that they have sleep paralysis and that they hallucinate someone who isn't there, they aren't able to resist the feeling when it happens.  I have two friends with sleep paralysis.  One of them doesn't experience anything other than not being able to move.  The other friend almost every time ""sees"" a tall man standing by the head of her bed (I forget if she actually sees him or if she just knows he's there).  Every single time, she's convinced that he's there to kill her."
ImaginaryMonsters,2zapdy,Eat_a_Bullet,2,Wed Mar 18 00:38:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's speculated that the ""night mare"" creature was an early explanation for sleep paralysis. Most cultures have some kind of myth about a demon that sits on your chest while you sleep, for some reason the iteration that caught on was the nightmare, a horse that would run around on your chest. I believe the creature in this picture is an incubus, the male version of a succubus that would sit on your chest and give you bad dreams"

ImaginaryMonsters,2xxm1k,loving_embrace,2,Thu Mar 5 15:07:09 2015 UTC,Maybe breathing goes through another hole like with a dolphin. Maybe the dress is very lightweight and moves easy with the wind.

ImaginaryMonsters,2xp6uq,HankyChief,16,Tue Mar 3 16:33:06 2015 UTC,"I'm usually not a big fan of the recurrent ""double eyes"" theme in monster design but I thought this image brought something new to that category, namely a completely fucking weird take on that whole trope.  Aaron Blaise spent 21 years in the warm, corporate grasp of Walt Disney Feature Animation where he created artwork for The Rescuers Down Under, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, The Lion King, Pocahontas, Mulan, Brother Bear (co-director, Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature Film.)  You can see more of his stuff on his blogspot and website, where he sells tutorials and brushes."
ImaginaryMonsters,2xp6uq,Karmanthanon,7,Mon Mar 2 19:45:51 2015 UTC,"I think the most interesting aspect of this creature is how the top set of eyes is feminine, and the bottom set is masculine. Seems to imply an alien race that is both genders."
ImaginaryMonsters,2xp6uq,mintmouse,6,Tue Mar 3 01:19:50 2015 UTC,"Our brains are wired to recognize and remember a lot of different information, but one thing we do really well is recalling other human faces. If we meet a new person, we don't store information about only their nose. We also don't remember each part of the face separately, we store (and recall) the whole face as a unit, paying special attention to the eyes. If you had to guess who a person was by only their eyes you'd do better than recognizing them by mouth or something.  When eyes or other facial features are doubled, our facial recognition struggles. We are accustomed to one pair of eyes, one nose, and one mouth. When seeing a face with two pairs of eyes, our brain chunks the mouth and nose with whichever pair you focus on, giving an unsettling feeling when you switch focus and ""lose"" sight of the face you first saw.  Here check this out.  The eyes on this drawing are human eyes in both shape and distance from each other. The closer a face is to human, the more clashing the distortion. Seeing an insect face with multiple sets of eyes doesn't produce the same effect as pronouncedly."

When it mindlessly finds that individual it bonds with them, physically.  Their bodies flowing together.  The bondee, having gained a mate for life and an extra set of eyes, it often decorates the remains of that creature's jawline with interesting piercings."
ImaginaryMonsters,2xp6uq,HumbleManatee,7,Mon Mar 2 22:54:58 2015 UTC,"I like to imagine that the whole race is sort of amphibious and evolved the second pair of eyes and extra nose to let them see and breathe both above and below the water while wading along the surface to give them a better chance at finding food and watching for predators. Then once they became one of the more dominant species on their planet the extra features stayed, even though they are not really necessary for survival anymore"

ImaginaryMonsters,2wr0j3,mintmouse,3,Mon Feb 23 00:18:08 2015 UTC,This beast has clearly never heard that you never get between a hippo and the water.
ImaginaryMonsters,2wr0j3,nukefudge,7,Mon Feb 23 00:49:56 2015 UTC,"Monsters are most often shown with their sights set on a character you can relate to, which helps you imagine what it would be like to face the monster for yourself. In some ways this is such a common practice that you tend to not see how human-centric those pieces are until you see something like this. It feels more real because it doesn't depend on your existence.  This encounter is not with a human. We do not see people fleeing in terror. We do not see a brave warrior steeling himself to face the monster. The African savannah is recognizable as a very real place, and yet it's not a human place.  It's clear that the hippo is outmatched and about to meet its fate, but it stands it's ground because, over thousands of years, that has worked for hippos. Nature isn't prepared for a threat like this. Maybe that's what makes it most frightening.  Animals live in an unforgiving, cutthroat world and hippos are big and dangerous and to be feared. You can see this hippo standing straight, strong, and firm. It is putting on it's best display, trying it's hardest.  By contrast, the monster seems very casual. It isn't rearing up and hissing, it has a hunched back and leans forward at an angle, it's hands aren't reaching, it's mouth only slightly opened. But, while the hippo has made a ""back off"" statement, the monster is moving forward. Its progress is inevitable, it won't be stopped."
ImaginaryMonsters,2wr0j3,Diredoe,4,Mon Feb 23 05:29:52 2015 UTC,This is wonderfully weird. Did you go for a bit of trypophobia on the monster there?
ImaginaryMonsters,2wr0j3,EdgarFrogandSam,2,Sun Feb 22 15:01:28 2015 UTC,And the hippo will still kick it's ass. You don't fuck around with hippos.

ImaginaryMonsters,2wbgyt,95Mb,9,Thu Feb 19 04:43:54 2015 UTC,"Actually that's not true. The xenomorph design by H.R Giger was first introduced in 1977 in his portfolio, Necronomicon. Giger's works are what influenced the design in Alien. In fact, Giger was contracted to produce concept art for the film.  Tyranids weren't a thing until Genestealers were introduced in the first edition of Warhammer 40,000 in 1987, 8 years after Alien had already been released and a decade after the original xenomorph design had been created."

ImaginaryMonsters,2wbgyt,Solozaur,8,Mon Feb 23 06:08:00 2015 UTC,Quite a lot actually! Warcraft is inspired from warhammer and starcraft from WH40k.
ImaginaryMonsters,2wbgyt,SOMUCHFRUIT,10,Thu Feb 19 01:35:48 2015 UTC,"More than inspired- GW and Blizzard were in talks to make a WHFB RTS. The negotiations broke down, Blizzard reskinned what they had as Warcraft, and tadaa! One of the biggest gaming franchises was born, and GW had begun their storied tradition of shooting themselves in the foot because they are grumpy about licensing.  I also heard a rumour (so take it with a pinch of salt) that when Blizzard was developing Starcraft, somehow GW gained access to their offices and found a 40k table with nids and Ultramarines on it. Dunno how true that is, but there's no doubt Blizzard did draw a lot from GW's Fantasy and 40k universes, but I wouldn't trust GW to put their trousers on the right way round in the morning, so it's great that Blizzard got the ideas and ran with them. It would be a very different gaming landscape if Warcraft and Starcraft had never been."

ImaginaryMonsters,2wbgyt,95Mb,-1,Fri Feb 20 12:41:41 2015 UTC,"I guess it only fitting that Valve made major profits by ""stealing"" DotA then, haha."
ImaginaryMonsters,2wbgyt,Daiephir,-1,Sat Feb 21 05:21:52 2015 UTC,What? That is entirely not the same thing. Blizzard needed to make back money on their investment and dev time. They had all the rights to sell a game they spent time building. How is that stealing when it's game workshop's fault in the end they never got a good RTS?
ImaginaryMonsters,2wbgyt,95Mb,0,Sat Feb 21 11:53:00 2015 UTC,"Whoa, sorry. Didn't know that would strike such an emotional chord with you.   I don't mean to say that Blizzard is bad for publishing StarCraft. I just mean that it's a funny coincidence that one of Valve's most profitable games is stolen from a company whose legacy comes from titles that aren't original to Blizzard either.  I also never said Blizzard stole anything. I said borrowed for a reason."

ImaginaryMonsters,2vrkgu,OhGarraty,2,Fri Feb 13 23:24:22 2015 UTC,"There are a few variables here. One, the surrounding area. If there's too little heat, the body will freeze and decomposition would occur very slowly. If there's a defect somewhere in the spacesuit, the vacuum will soon destroy any bacteria for decomposition. Any water would also evaporate very quickly in the vacuum, mummifying the body. If the suit remains intact and is near enough to a heat source, aerobic bacteria would soon run out of oxygen; the body would be broken down mainly by anaerobic bacteria in a process of fermentation. Soon the body would turn into a soup floating around inside the spacesuit, and after that nothing but bones would remain. Without anything to break the skeleton apart, the bone-filled spacesuit would float around indefinitely."

When the explorers get close enough to investigate, then it attacks. Pretty soon, space goes as silent as it ever was, and no one is the wiser.  Basically immortal, it finds itself in some of the strangest parts of the galaxy; and very rarely, it'll find itself in a neighboring galaxy all together, as passerby's hitch it a ride or two every now and then.   Some of the older civilizations have grown to understand the danger of these homeless bodies, and those that are unfortunate enough to find a motionless corpse in the middle of their travels are always wary of it being that thing.  Other civilizations spread tales of it's existence, never directly acknowledging if the stories are true, or if it's just the rambling's of some drunk adventurers."

He once was a prince who loved hunting throughout the desert, but he soon grew to be too good at hunting. Beasts, monsters, even humans, soon became a bore, unexciting and droll. It was then that Ahriman, the literal God of Darkness, promised to provide hunts that were beyond the Prince's wildest dreams. It was an offer too tempting to ignore. The Prince accepted, taking in the Corruption that turned him into a monster, the ultimate Hunter. The Corruption cost him his soul, but at that point, he no longer cared."
