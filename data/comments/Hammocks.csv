Hammocks,3e56vd,fitzkits,2,Wed Jul 22 01:19:31 2015 UTC,"I have a small business (Fitz Kits) building things out of ""lean pipe"", and I was going to build a standing desk with it for my GF who was complaining about her posture while she works at her home office.  Instead, I surprised her with the opposite - a hammock desk. Distributes the pressure throughout your body so it doesn't hurt your butt. She liked it and I decided to turn it into a kit that I'll put on my site.  Basically it will be a stand for the whole rig, and you buy a hammock chair off of amazon and a specific board from Lowe's and it all just bolts together. Kind of like Ikea furniture.  As far as I can tell there isn't something out there like this right now, I'm still working on it but I could have it be a kit on my site by the end of the week. If you guys like the idea I can repost it here when it's an actual thing you can buy."

I've used them on maybe 30 trips, never had an issue with bugs getting in. If you are going to DIY, pick up your netting from Quest Outfitters... it's somewhat rigid or stiff and it's easy to sew. Some of the bugnet I've handled is really silky and fine and is just about impossible to sew effectively."

I swore by the sock for the longest time, till i made a fronky style and I just left the head end a little larger so I could fit the hammock through it easily and used a cord/cordlock to cinch it shut when deployed. Getting into and out of the fronky net is alot easier, but if you dont have protection under you, the buggers can chomp your ass through the hammock material. No big deal if you're using an UQ.   I used some cheap sheer shades from walmart following crypticcricket's tutorial.  I had to use an extra peice on the ends to get it to fit my 11' hammock but it works great.

Hammocks,3dyk0c,Aforcedfart,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:25:02 2015 UTC,"have one and use it regularly, only had a problem with bugs getting in when camping in what was essentially a swamp.  Since then I've treated my bug net with permithrin, and I've never had another problem again.  I have a yukon zipper bugnet hammock, never camped with it but I've used it in the backyard. I don't thiink that style is less likely to let bugs in, but it does make it impossible to things like hang your boots  from the ridge line or store extra clothing inside the bugnet. Not being able to toss stuff into the netting below or hang stuff from the ridge line above were a real deal breaker for me. I'll probably give that hammock away or let a guest use it, before I ever take it camping myself."

As the others said, get the tarp tighter as well. If it rains, you don't want any pooling at all. A small pool can cause sagging which can quickly create a larger pool. Larger pools can end up pulling the whole thing down. I speak from experience.   Other than that, get out there and experiment. Nothing beats experience for figuring out what makes the best set-up for each individual person! And a night in a hammock can only be so bad :)"

Hammocks,3dmn8q,CallinInstead,-14,Sat Jul 18 09:55:43 2015 UTC,If you're sleeping in that it's probably not flat enough. The curve of the hammock gets real annoying after you keep waking up in the middle of the night.

Hammocks,3dkkib,Bocce82,6,Fri Jul 17 00:47:17 2015 UTC,"I don't see any reason it wouldn't be a good first hammock. I've got one of his PolyD ones, and it's quite nice. Excess static in dry weather is really my only minor complaint about it, but I understand the NylonD and Argon ones are less trouble there.  The ""Knotty Mod"" is a tweak to a standard gathered-end hammock that HammockForums member, Knotty, posted about, hence the name. It uses a length of shock cord to tension the side of the hammock in a way that creates a pseudo-footbox and prevents floppy sides. A double knotty mod does the same thing on both sides.  I believe by default Dutch puts them both at the foot end when he does them, so you can cinch whichever side you choose to put your feet on. Some people like to have them diagonally opposite -- one at their feet and one at their shoulder -- and Dutch has said that he'll do them that way if you request it. But if this is your first hammock you may not know which way you prefer to lie. You might just leave it off entirely since it's not really necessary, and it's something that you could just choose to add on yourself after the fact if you really wanted to.  A structural ridgeline gives you a fixed minimum amount of sag for your hammock, which can help keep your hammock comfortable under a wider range of hanging conditions. Personally, I don't like recommending too much reliance on them for that purpose. You still want to be able to dial in your suspension properly -- an overly taut hang will still put a tremendous amount of stress into your lines and straps even if the ridgeline keeps the hammock itself from being too taut. Mostly I like them because they're a good place to hang things while I'm in my hammock."

But their other options are straight-up ripoffs, IMO. The fact that they market the Ember 2 as a 4-season quilt makes me not even want to begrudge them that much, but the price isn't horrendous even if its weight and temperature rating is.  In the lower price points I would really be looking at Arrowhead Equipment's Kick Ass Quilts. If you're willing to spend more, a down underquilt is a massive step up in performance for weight/bulk in your pack if you're backpacking. HammockGear, UGQ, and JRB all make great quilts that will work with any gathered-end hammock.  On your more general question, an underquilt doesn't cover you on top. In some weather you can certainly get away without anything else, but in most cases if you need an underquilt you'll also want something else on top of you. A down top quilt is nice, but you can also use a simple blanket or even just a sleeping bag if you're looking to keep costs down."

Hammocks,3dfa68,mrjowee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:46:12 2015 UTC,"I will echo what eveyone else said. You need more sag, and getting longer straps or a different suspension system might be a good idea. With those two trees your straps would have to be attached higher up. I will also highly recommend setting up a structural ridgeline, as it makes it very easy to get a consistent and appropriate sag. It just involves having a rope tied between the two carabiners. Also once you have it set up with more sag try laying with your body diagonal to the center line instead of parallel to it."
Hammocks,3dfa68,rustyjanes,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:33:16 2015 UTC,"Get a structural ridgeline and make it 83% of the length of your hammock end to end. Measure it your self. This will prevent your hammock from stretching out past a certain distance and will give you a perfect 30 degree hang every time no matter what. Also you want the hammock to look like a banana, not flat."

It feels more like being on a cruise than travelling. I did coach about a year and a half ago, and while it's a lot cheaper, sleeping in your seat and trying to relax in a car that's potentially full of screaming children is pretty rough, the sleeper is much more private. The sleeper also includes your meals (three a day, we ended up getting four both ways with the way the schedule lined up) which are shockingly excellent for travel food. I had fantastic steak and salmon for dinner.  Just for the food and privacy, I'd say give it a try if you're travelling with someone. I'd definitely do it again, it felt like it was part of my vacation, rather than the aggravating TSA-filled bookends of airline travel."

The seal is far from air-tight, so I don't think you'd be able to get away with an actual cigarette, though. They boot you from the train if you're caught vaping, but if I had tried using the bathrooms and sleeper with the blinds drawn I would tell you it seems pretty easy to discretely get away with it.  They do stop every two-four hours at a station long enough for a smoke break, though."

Hammocks,3d7yis,rustyjanes,2,Tue Jul 14 17:18:39 2015 UTC,"The only downside to this is it increases the minimum distance you need between the trees to hang. I think it's nice to have the continuous loops because you can hook them directly to marlinspike hitch, with whoopies it adds a few feet. I've on a number of occasions found myself trying to hang between close trees where I had to take off the whoopies.  However if you were relying solely on loops and straps you'd be pretty limited in covering longer distances. I was feeling thrifty when I made my Dutch order so I just ordered amsteel and a bunch of webbing. I tied loops on the end of the webbing to make straps and made my own loops and whoopies. It saved a few bucks and was as fun skill to learn.  I'm not a very handy/diy sort of person, so I'd definitely say anyone can do it."
Hammocks,3d7yis,supernettipot,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:30:34 2015 UTC,Would it be possible to have both a continuous loop and a whoopie sling running through each gathered end? That way the distance between trees would be easier to manage?
Hammocks,3d7yis,ConvertsToMetric,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:33:25 2015 UTC,"The continous loop goes through the gathered end and then you attach the whoopie to the continous loop. It's super easy to take on and off with a lark's head knot, or you can get whoopie hooks. This way you don't have to mess around with the gathered end as the loop always stays in it. It's all kind of confusing when you're reading about it, but once you get the gear it becomes easy to understand."
Hammocks,3d7yis,psmwrxguy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:42:54 2015 UTC,"You dont even need the whoopie slings if you get 12 foot straps.  Two continuous loops, two 12' straps, and a couple toggles for the marlin and you're set."

Hammocks,3d7xi2,JustifiedGaines,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:03:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  I got thinking about it and, in such a small space, it made so little sense to dedicate enough volume to create a sleeping loft or bedroom capable of holding a queen sized mattress/bed.    The hallmark of a well designed tiny house is multifunctional spaces.  The common sleeping loft does not seem a particularly efficient use of space, unless it's also useful during the daytime, too.  I'd rather sleep in my hammock, anyway, but even if it represented a change, it's a design change that would make sense."

Weigh down one end with something or secure one end so it can't twist.   Start gently twisting the other end. It will twist up to a solid 'rope'. Continue gently twisting so it coils onto its self.  Most importantly, get or make a storage bag that doesn't allow it to uncoil.   When you need it, don't just grab an end and shake. Reverse the process slowly."

Generally speaking cheap tarps are resilient but the tie offs or grommets can be weak. The GT double is a big guy, I used one as my primary for a while and my only problem was my tarp was never long enough to gain full coverage.   So make sure you're getting a tarp large enough to avoid drips into your sleep area from either end. Get plenty of cordage like 550 paracord and prep yourself with a plan to tie a ridgeline. I'm a fan of using a nite ize figure 9 to help get a ridgeline up quickly. You can slap on some prusik knots and have a sliding adjustable tarp to make sure youre always covered.  Bug nets vary. For me, a simple bug out bag worked, keeps you warm in cooler summer weather as well."

Hammocks,3cx3oh,thiel,4,Sat Jul 11 20:00:05 2015 UTC,Yeah - if you just know which screws to use where then you can get away with using fairly nimble looking setup.  Brick wall is a bit tricky (hard to tell when you've hit the middle of a brick) so that's why I've opted for a 4 screw setup.

Hammocks,3cza5f,rustyjanes,2,Sun Jul 12 04:21:15 2015 UTC,"I'd advise against an eno. They're nice for lounging in but just not quite long enough to be excellent. Try to make sure whatever you get is at least 11 feet long. There's lots great hammocks made in the US by cottage vendors. You can read about them on hammockforums.net.   I personally love my DIY table cloth hammock. It's not good for hiking as it's very heavy but it's the perfect backyard/car camping hammock.  You can order a 90×156 crinkle taffeta table cloth for less than $30 after shipping. It comes with all the edges hemmed so you don't need to do any sewing, just whip the ends together and tie some cord around it. Some people nay say the method due to concerns about the reliability of the material,  but people have been successfully hanging in these for quite a while and problems are possible with any hammock.  I also have an eno double and a 11 foot dutchware nylon,  but I definitely find my ivory table cloth to be the most comfortable. It's just so nice and roomy, in definitely a fan of huge hammocks.  http://www.tableclothsfactory.com/category-s/149.htm"

Hammocks,3cyooh,FeedMeCletus,2,Sun Jul 12 03:35:39 2015 UTC,I highly suggest the Hex tarp. This tarp single-handedly saved a backpacking trip I took with two friends. It rained all weekend and this tarp gave us a place to hang out and do everything necessary at camp. Even room to stretch our legs.  I have the 70d and the weight and pack size is not bad at all. Unless you really want to save weight the extra $$ is not necessary. Get the 70d

Hammocks,3ctfif,HammockFanatic,3,Sat Jul 11 17:12:26 2015 UTC,Giveaway aside.. Are these any good? I've never tried a Mayan hammock before.
Hammocks,3ctfif,tangbang,5,Fri Jul 10 22:31:48 2015 UTC,"So obviously we're going to come off as biased but I'll give you as unbiased an answer as possible...   There are 5 main hammock styles: camping, Mayan, Brazilian, Nicaraguan, and Americana/rope.   Never by a thick rope hammock, they just do not compare to any of the other types in terms of versatility, comfort, or value.  Nicaraguan have the spreader bars on them but feature a much tighter knit than rope. They can be like Mayans with a loose weave or like Brazilians with a tighter weave, but the bar is a deal breaker for us. We recognize some people like it, but we have never been in a situation where we are happy to have it. They greatly decrease stability of the hammock (not including bridge style hammocks).  Brazilian hammocks as I mentioned have a much tighter weave than Mayans, generally. They are more like a solid piece of fabric where as Mayans are clearly weaved. The Brazilians are very comfortable as well, but we prefer the loose Mayans as they get more air flow and feel softer since there isn't taught fabric in all locations.  Mayans have the loose weave you see in the pictures on our site. Combining all my other points, we love them because they are soft, breathable, stretchy, huge, and strong. They maximize all of those categories and really can't be beat.  Camping happens to destroy Mayans in the realm of versatility. They are more durable and much more mobile (obviously).   Sorry for the rambling rant, I'm packing for vacation and wanted to quickly give you an overview!"
Hammocks,3ctfif,HammockFanatic,4,Fri Jul 10 23:10:56 2015 UTC,"Cool! I've only used camping hammocks and those shitty rope ones that every other family seems to have in their backyards. Would you happen to have any information on weight, packed size, and maximum weight it could carry? Also, will normal camping setups work for hanging one of these hammocks?"
Hammocks,3ctfif,tangbang,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:09:50 2015 UTC,"Yes I do. You'll have to wait until I get home for the exact weight and size. Can't believe I didn't already post that, totally embarrassed. Keep in mind they are much heavier than a camping hammock.  What is a normal camping setup? Do you mean tree straps and a whoopie sling? If so, yes.  There's another thing I can't believe I never put up, a hanging a mayan hammock guide... thanks for the questions.  Also, the ones we have aren't designed for prolonged outdoor hanging. And by that I mean we recommend either using a weatherproof sock or taking the hammock down in between uses. We have weatherproof socks that we'll be adding to the site. We haven't yet because we are trying to find a way to source them cheap and include them with every Mayan hammock. As it stands the ones we have will be $20.   The reason they can't be left outside is they are cotton. Rain and sun wears on it considerably and the lifespan will decrease considerably. With proper care they can last a very long time."
Hammocks,3ctfif,HammockFanatic,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:04:18 2015 UTC,Yeah no worries! Thanks for the answers!  I do mean a tree straps and a piece of rope/whoopie sling to loop through the end of the hammock. That's good to know that I won't have to go hunting for a way to hang this new hammock.  It also looks like Nylon is an option for the hammock (vs. cotton). Could you comment on the differences between the Nylon and the cotton?
Hammocks,3ctfif,tangbang,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:19:35 2015 UTC,"Yes. So the on paper difference is nylon will be better for outdoor use, maintain its color longer, deal with getting wet better, stretch a little less, but sacrifice the softness of cotton.  We are in the process of testing all of those claims now to see if this is true, as we honestly didn't know to what degree this is true.  From a comfort stand point, I can tell when I first get in which is which, but it's a minor difference. We've had friends and family try both and they don't notice the difference.   On the durability side, the jury is still out. But it makes sense nylon will last longer than cotton."

Hammocks,3cqzkf,Hammerosu,13,Fri Jul 10 01:58:00 2015 UTC,"I spent most of 6 months in my hammock while cycling around Europe. Yes, definitely, had to pee every night about 4am. Never happened in a hostel bed. I was always comfortable, diagonal and had it strung tight but I was still more curved than on a bed so I thought the ""bunching"" of the organs in that curve was one likely culprit. I didn't consider that I might just be sleeping lighter, that certainly has its merits. I tried holding it in and forcing myself to adapt to not going, but then I wouldn't sleep again or well from holding it back. Seemed better just to get it over and done with and appreciate the stars for a moment.  EDIT: Further; I did once try to pee from the hammock, a Hennessy Expedition Zip, by opening the fly net and zipping my sleeping bag down but mostly staying in it. It was cold, I was fatigued, I made a poor decision. Three quarters through, I thought I was in the clear and squeezed for a strong finish, but this subtle tension shifted my weight and I slid back into both hammock and sleeping bag before I could shut it off. So then I had to get out anyway and returned to bed still cold, still fatigued and damp with that unwelcome smell and static-like feeling that water alone will not bring you. I deem the maneuver unsafe practice and recommend you never, ever try this."

Hammocks,3cqdqv,Bocce82,2,Thu Jul 9 22:55:53 2015 UTC,"There are several options for straps and suspension, as well as bug nets. I prefer a cinch buckle suspension, wherein you use long 1"" polyester straps and a small buckle to suspend the hammock. They are very easy to adjust.   Your choice of bugnet depends on the environment and how warm it is at night. If you're not using any insulation under you, you may need a full coverage bugnet (such as one made by Wilderness Logics). The Fronkey Style bugnet from Dutchware is a good, cheap alternative, but leaves you partially exposed without insulation.  Try out a nylon gathered end hammock. They're way more comfortable than the net style. Unfortunately the only ones available from REI are EAgles Nest Outfitters. ENO hammocks are ok, but at 9' 4"" long they are rather short for most people. They're also expensive and heavy. Stick to cottage manufacturers.  Most of the country is covered in trees. There are some exceptions, but for the bash majority of people it's always easier to find a place for a hammock. Rocks, sticks, mud, uneven terrain... none of it matters.  Check out HammockForums.net as well."

Hammocks,3cmu2n,TheGeckoDude,5,Thu Jul 9 03:17:59 2015 UTC,"They are used for setting how your hammock hangs at a fixed point.  Without a ridgeline, you must loosen your straps to go from a flat (lengthwise) hang to a more ""U"" shaped (lengthwise) hang (which can allow a more flat lay on diagonal).  If you prefer a more ""U"" shaped hang, you might have issues with low or far apart mounting points causing you to touch or hang close to the ground.  A ridgeline can allow you to keep the hammock hanging looser while keeping the straps tighter and the hammock higher when mounting height and/or distance is not ideal.    Also, once you find the sweet spot of how much of a ""U"" shape you like in a particular hammock, you can set ridgeline to that (the distance between hammock ends) and always have the hammock hang that way, in any mounting situation, without having to adjust the strap tension.  The hammock hangs from the ridgeline - you use straps to mount the ridgeline and adjust its height from the ground without affecting the sag (U-shape) of the hammock.  It keeps your experience in the hammock more consistent and less effected by changes outside of the hammock (with regards to mounting location)."

A ridgeline may help with this. When a hammock has the appropriate sag you can lie more horizontally and have a flatter area for your body. Being flat will help to alleviate both of the issues you described.  This can also be a symptom of the hammock being too short for you. How tall are you? ENO hammocks are on the short end for being comfortable for overnight sleeping. My wife is 5'7"" and is perfectly fine in an ENO double with a ridgeline. I'm 6' and was never able to get a very comfortable lie in it for anything more than a nap. I've since moved to an 11' hammock body and all of the calf ridge issues I had in the ENO are gone.  If you are interested in trying one out, I can point you to a few sites that sell adjustable ridgelines. This will let you play with the length until you find what works best for you."

First, no matter the weather, a fly is a good idea, as any amount of dew will soak your gear without one. Second, an emergency poncho is likely not big or strong enough to be an effective fly. Especially if it is one of those plastic emergency ones.  Army/Navy stores sometimes still have old NATO ponchos that are made to also be a fly. In fact, back in the day soldiers could snap two together and make a tiny two-man pup tent. They aren't very light, though, and I don't know how much they are.   My frugal hammock fly is repurposed from an old tent. Perhaps you can score a used tent on the cheap and do the same.

Hammocks,3cetbi,BeardToast,12,Tue Jul 7 14:38:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  The Power Bank is made by a company called EasyAcc, it's pretty decent and relatively cheap, it comes with a carabiner and compass and it has a little flashlight too, nothing too bright, but great as a night light in the hammock.  The USB fan is AMAZING and super cheap, I have 2 of them, for when I'm using a power bank with 2 outputs. It's really quiet and puts out an impressive breeze, and It hardly drains the battery at all.  I imagine on that 9000mAh battery it would run day and night for a week.  I love that fan, when the flies and mosquitoes are out and it's hot, the bug net blocks most of the breeze, that fan solves the problem perfectly.  Beyond that you just need a closed loop of bungee cord (I had a load that came with my Skeeter Beeter Pro, it basically loops around the battery pack.  Here's the review I did, It's got links to the charger and fan at the bottom. - http://gadgetviper.com/easyacc-waterproof-power-bank-review/"

All items are to be priced at $7.16.  Not sure how many they will put up, but you might just get lucky."

Also, you should definitely get the zip, as it's considerably more convenient, from what I've heard.

If ocean, I call it North or South Pacific, Pacific last because it's the noun.  When referring to the land, I use Pacific first because it's an adjective referring to where the land is (on the Pacific coast).  I only use PNW when talking about the region that includes the USA.  When talking about coastal BC, I use north coast, south coast, central coast, Haida Gwaii, or Vancouver Island.  When talking about the Pacific near BC, I use northeast Pacific.  The Pacific near Japan, I use northwest Pacific.  This is all probably more than you wanted to know, but now you've gotten to the end and you can't take it back."

Hammocks,3c3pbt,mashedvote,7,Sat Jul 4 15:12:07 2015 UTC,Try the diagonal lay before you try a new hammock. There is a good reason many people prefer a double hammock. All that extra fabric that is flopping in your face when your lie straight down the middle is what allows you to position yourself at an even greater angle to the center line of your hammock. This lets you lie flatter.
Hammocks,3c3pbt,audioscience,3,Sat Jul 4 16:33:31 2015 UTC,Just piling on with what everyone else is saying.  Have a higher hang angle and lay diagonally.  This should help: http://www.treklightgear.com/treklife/how-to-hang-your-hammock/

To get a comfortable hang, your straps will have to go higher (depending on the distance between your mount points). With a better angle it becomes easier to do the diagonal lay.  Hope this helps.   Tl; Dr: there's nothing wrong with your hammock.  Don't get rid of it. Just hang it differently."
Hammocks,3c3pbt,photosmore,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:00:22 2015 UTC,"As everyone else has already mentioned you need to lay diagonal to the center line.

Hammocks,3c3pbt,redneckgymrat,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:32:50 2015 UTC,"Okay, look at it this way.  Right now you're laying from end to end, in a sling.  Just as an experiment, turn 90 degrees.  Lay across it.  At right angles.  A double hammock is usually around 5-6 feet wide, so you may nor may not fit in it, completely, but just let your legs dangle off the side.  Notice how that feels.  You're being cradled, not cocooned.  Now, spin around.  Rotate just enough to fit your whole body, head to toe, from edge to edge.  And pay attention to how you feel.  Wiggle around.  Squirm around until you find that sweet spot.  It will feel like you're floating, nearly weightless.  And then, enjoy the bliss."

The ENO is used exclusively for lounging with the fiancée, while the Dutchware is used for anything solo, including camping (both backpacking and car camping).  The Dutchware is much more comfortable because of it's size. The ability to lie flat in a hammock is more determined by it's length rather than it's width. My PolyD is 11' long, while the Doublenest is 9.5'. It's too short for me to sleep in comfortably throughout the night. The ENO is much wider, but while lying alone the extra width is just a bunch of extra material just flopping around. Also, the PolyD doesn't stretch at all.

It must be a very exciting time for you with all this going on, try to enjoy it as much as treading/planning carefully.  First thought; great idea!   The biggest issue with hammocks is that they are not really ""Available"" for optimal use everywhere (Indoors, Treeless plains, no safe place to tether, etc) You are solving this problem by making a bracket that a hammock can attach to, that everyone owns.. a bedframe/loft/bedbunk,etc....   You can have a hammock at a friends house or at your parent's; it doesn't really matter how dedicated you are to the hobby or how badly you want to hammock. (Yes. there are trees outside. I know. Trees exist.)  If you have nowhere to hang, you have nowhere to hang.  Your bracket fixes this problem easily. I like it.    By just creating a product for dorms; you are severely limiting your demographic.  I drew a little diagram so that there isn't any confusion.  Unless I am misinterpreting your design; it seems to really only work with single lofts. fuck you double loft guy  Not everyone owns a loft, while many students in dorms do; not all.  But bigger than that, you are limiting your demographic to one type of bed. Why not think bigger and go larger; support other types of beds.     The only kind of ""uh-oh"" or worry I have about your idea is legality and safety.  Because the bracket attaches to the bedframe, in terms of safety; everything depends on the bed-frame.   The bracket could be a indestructible, but it won't matter if the bed breaks.  I mean the students with the old, study wooden lofts don't really need to care but not everyone is a skilled carpenter.  And to extend on the legality; people getting injured from your product.   ie.  dumb student uses bracket properly but injures himself anyway. lawsuit. (can't really stop that, can you?)  student uses bracket. has shitty bedframe and it breaks, lawsuit    TLDR;  Again, first of all; kudos to you OP. I cannot imagine a better experience in life than chasing your dreams; running your own business, etc.  My main points of concern:  Support for other types of bed/furniture.  Safety/legality issues.    Great Idea. Great thread, thanks for posting OP and I hope you keep updating us with what happens,  Breathe deep, hang low."
Hammocks,3buf5x,PikKirby,2,Thu Jul 2 08:34:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your thoughts- it's been a lot of work, but this is the starting point, and if it takes off, I'll most definitely be looking to expand it.    Yes, the liability factor is definitely something to consider.  I've been working with an insurance underwriter who said this kind of thing falls under the category of a public nuisance (same as a owning a trampoline in your yard or a swimming pool).  The positive thing is that the student is only 10"" off the ground, so in the event of a fall, it's very unlikely to cause any kind of serious injury.  To try to prevent issues/accidents from happening, I'm working on a thorough instruction sheet, and a waiver as part of the order form process.    I also appeciate your diagram.  I've spent a lot of time sketching up different models for different bed types, and if the kickstarter proves to be a success, I'll definitely explore pursing those.    The bottom line for me is this:  Hammocks are relaxing because they are so comfortably.  Shouldn't we then try to capitalize on that by putting them in inherently stressful environments (like college campuses)?   What if airports had a some hung up?  Or dentists offices?  Or your work breakroom?"
Hammocks,3buf5x,goodevilgenius,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:42:50 2015 UTC,"I think the idea is great. I have a couple of thoughts about it.  I'm not certain the implementation is completely ideal. E.g., in this picture on your Facebook page, the guy looks a little cramped. When I was single, I regularly slept in a my hammock, and that hang doesn't look comfortable for sleeping.  Are these kinds of beds common in college dorms? I was in a dorm for one year while in college, and my dorm had regular beds. This wouldn't have been usable in my dorms, and the other dorms I've seen have all been the same. I, personally, have never seen a bunk bed in a college dorm, but maybe my experience is too limited. I'm just worried that your target audience might be too small to make a profit.  But I do love the idea. Helping people use hammocks more is always a great goal."
Hammocks,3buf5x,irishjihad,2,Thu Jul 2 15:00:55 2015 UTC,I agree that the dimensions of a dorm loft bed does not provide sufficient length for a proper hang for sleeping unless you're under 5' tall.

I agree about that pic, it looks like he's a little cramped.  But, that's because he's sitting full parallel to the hammock (when optimally, you should be sitting at a light diagnal).   I've had guys around 6'3"" give it a try and say it was just fine.     For context, I've worked in the Housing Dept at a couple universities.  The loft style bed is where almost all schools are heading.  They are just more functional, and only mildly more expensive.     The business model will operate as a rental, instead of a selling them to students.  Since most students only live on campus for a year, renting just makes more sense."

Hammocks,3buf5x,Roomslinger,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:07:42 2015 UTC,You may want to talk to some student housing facilities  maintenance and/or residential life  employees  to find out how willing or non-willing they would be to have students altering furniture. If you can address any issues upfront it may help your sales.
Hammocks,3buf5x,Roomslinger,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:39:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your insight Roomslinger-  As a former Res Life staff, I've looked into many of these concerns and have gotten nearly the same feedback.  The general policies that schools have are policies against 3rd party lofting kits, and that as long as the dorm furniture is returned at the end of the year undamaged, they are pretty flexible.  Going from that standard, this project ought to be fine."
Hammocks,3bwvqd,ChristopherWebber,5,Thu Jul 2 20:34:44 2015 UTC,"i did the double sleeping bag pea pod thingy when it got down to about 40 at night.  use one bag as blanket and the other, make a pea pod by sliding the hammock thru the ends of the bag and just slide it over you.... i was roasting.  Janky, but it worked."
Hammocks,3bwvqd,ezshucks,2,Thu Jul 2 20:57:59 2015 UTC,"This is a great solution, OP. PeaPod each hammock with a sleeping bag and use blankets to supplement.   Or use sleeping pads under you, with sleeping bags on top."

It's an eno double nest, Big Agnes double z sleeping pad (25 wide) however I think I will return this and look into quilts, if i can find one that packs small and light. Sleeping pad was hard to keep in place. And the tarp was a generic Eno tarp. Not bad, nothing special."
Hammocks,3bs27k,joshreid45,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:22:56 2015 UTC,"There's lots of quilts if you're willing to spend the money for light and packable. Hammock Gear, Jacks R Better, Warbonnet. Or for synthetic less light quilts Arrowhead Equipment (which I have and do lots of backpacking) As for the tarp, that looks like an Eno Profly. Nothing special? I really like this tarp. It comes with line locks has good coverage always keeps me dry and it's decent in weight and size."
Hammocks,3brzyd,Taurich,2,Wed Jul 1 17:56:05 2015 UTC,"I'd look up the design for the turtle dog stand. It is somewhat similar, but uses two tripods and only one cross brace."

Hammocks,3brzyd,po_ta_to,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:57:02 2015 UTC,"I would add in 2x4s that go from the legs up to the beam to make triangles. Without any diagonal your design would be wobbly. If I grabbed the beam and wiggled, there is nothing to prevent movement parallel to the beam."
Hammocks,3brzyd,ItNeedsMoreFun,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:58:44 2015 UTC,"This is all theoretical, as I haven't built a hammock stand (but I've built plent of other stuff), but I would trust the turtle dog stand design more than your design.  You could buy a bigger hinge if you are worried about its strength, or you could secure the pipe to the tripod with rope or something if you didn't want to stress the hinge.   I would guess that failure in a hammock stand is more likely to come from movement or angled forces twisting something apart than from straight downward weight. I agree with /u/po_ta_to about where your stand is likely to have problems.   If you wanted to try the giant sawhorse, I would consider doing an I-beam style sawhorse rather than using the little brackets.  Using 2x4s for the i-beam will be super strong. Then for the legs, you can either add diagonal braces like /u/po_ta_to suggested, or make the legs out of much wider boards like 2x8s to give them a much larger area to fasten to the i-beam. The I-beam design gives you a lot more flexibility in how you do the legs.   Another option would be to put two of those brackets on each side a foot or two apart, giving you two sets of legs on each side. Then you could add diagonal braces between the two legs. Looking at an elevation of your beam it would look kind of like this:  __________ N        N   Not sure if that totally makes sense...  But I think that beefing up the hinge on a well tested design like the turtle dog stand is probably a better bet than trying to design from scratch, unless you're down for experimenting and potentially having a few failures before getting it just right."

Hammocks,3boi43,realslacker,3,Thu Jul 2 18:05:52 2015 UTC,"There are only a few reasons a hammock will rip:   Manufacturing defect Tear Age/wear Over weight limit (usually by a lot) Incorrect hang angle - failure caused by too taunt of a hang angle is similar to over weight failure   I'm guessing it was either 1, 2 or 5 in your case. Remember, the lower the angle of the dangle the more weight on the hammock, suspension, and trees.  Also, please note that even ripstop won't stop catastrophic failure. It can help with wear and small tears, but incorrect hang angle or over weight failure will result in catastrophic failure."
Hammocks,3boi43,Bradleyjc,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:06:37 2015 UTC,Please elaborate. I left my eno in a hot car and I am worried it may have weakened the fabric. How exactly should my hang angle look?
Hammocks,3boi43,realslacker,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:22:18 2015 UTC,"Unless it get's to the melting point of the fabric (I would guess it's well over 150°F) you aren't going to damage the fabric by getting it hot in a car. Most wear is just going to be from use... like getting in and out 100s of times, or moving around in your sleep. I would guess that with normal wear and tear you could expect most every hammock to last at least a few seasons.  You should be trying to achieve a 30° hang angle."

Hammocks,3beji8,dahlberg123,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:20:56 2015 UTC,"I have a Doublenest and Guardian bug net because they came together with a ProFly & Atlas Straps that came together in a bundle.   If you plan to keep the Doublenest as your primary hammock for the foreseeable future because you just plain love it, the Guardian fits it quite nicely.   I like my setup just fine, although I am looking at an XLC as a second system, likely making my Doublenest secondary. And part of the reason is because I would like better bug net integration on some more challenging treks.   The Guardian can make getting in and out of the Doublenest a little more fiddly than I want it to be for midnight constitutionals. But it's a minor complaint.   Upgrading your system may be more costly than just buying the bug net, which is why I brought up how much you love your Doublenest.   Also, how big & heavy you are may limit your upgrade options into more costly upgrades. I'm a big 'un, so when I upgrade, my wallet will notice.  And if you use a small eno tarp, it may not be long enough for the new hammock.   Those are the main things I can think of when navigating this upgrade."

Hammocks,3bazxz,RockyShea,3,Sat Jun 27 15:19:12 2015 UTC,This right here.   I hang a 20 foot span in my yard.  My tree straps end up about 10 feet up the trees.  I use a sick to push them high enough.  This calculator is a life hang saver.

Hammocks,3bazxz,ScotchAnne,6,Sat Jun 27 20:16:59 2015 UTC,Just because the (suspension) is attached to the tree that high does not mean the hammock is any higher. This is about the angle the suspension comes down off the tree. If there is not enough of an angle then you risk harming the tree or overloading your suspension or both.  edit: (suspension)
Hammocks,3bazxz,Topplestack,3,Sat Jun 27 20:28:35 2015 UTC,But why wouldn't an empty hammock be 10 ft off the ground in that case?
Hammocks,3bazxz,whabt,2,Sun Jun 28 00:10:16 2015 UTC,Because the straps are long enough that the whole business hangs low enough to sit in.
Hammocks,3bazxz,Topplestack,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:34:06 2015 UTC,Exactly what /u/whabt said. The suspension should hang down at a 30 degree angle.  Edit: I also don't know why you got downvoted. It's a good question if you aren't entirely clear about what I meant.

Hammocks,3bazxz,Carpe_Ictal,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:46:30 2015 UTC,"With the slack in the suspension the hammock hangs at about chair height. To attain a 30degree angle on the hammock, you need the suspension straps up pretty high."

Hammocks,3b9a1z,gcracker05,3,Sat Jun 27 03:06:16 2015 UTC,I took a few more pictures here. http://imgur.com/a/b0pL5  Basically just two ropes anchoring away and the pole just rests against the ground. Everything is approximately at a 60° angle. Eventually I’ll add another rope above the hammock that will go from the tree (or car) to the pole.   Pole breaks into two in the middle so about 4 ft sections.   Other benefits is the pole doubles to use for festivus!

Also, you're losing quite a bit of length of the hammock attaching it that way.  At the same time, you're bunching what's normally a wider part of the hammock, making the lay not nearly as comfortable.    If it were me, I'd keep looking for a better way to hang it rather than risking falling on my ass with metal falling on me for the reward of a sub-par hang."

Hammocks,3b5ntx,hangingfrog,9,Fri Jun 26 05:13:26 2015 UTC,"The vertical stresses might be fine, it's the horizontal that I think might cause structural failure.  Also, a bed resting on those bars distributes the weight across a larger area, the hammock concentrates all of that force in a small area.  Try using this calculator with the length of the hammock and the distance between your hang points along with your weight: http://theultimatehang.com/hammock-hang-calculator/  It's pretty crazy how much horizontal stress exists in a hang."

This was the first time my friend was using his hammock and he's totally hooked after this  My setup    Hammock - ENO Doublenest Suspension - Dutchware Kevlar Straps with Dutch buckle Tarp - ENO ProFly UQ - ENO Blaze Gear Loft - TrekLightGear Versatrek   (Yeah it is a lot of ENO but when you win it for free or receive it as a gift you'd be stupid not to use it) I plan on making my own hammock and a bugnet this summer  Day 1. we met in SF and then camped at Bodega Bay.   Day 2. we took the Hwy 1 all the way up to Patricks Point and made some sweet stops on that trip.   Day 3. drove to Jessie M. Honeyman state park.  Day 4. drove to Fort Stevens campground.   Day 5. drove to Olympia and then finally made it home.  yeah it's not the entire coast but it was a ton of fun and I highly recommend doing it if you have the chance.

Hammocks,3awql9,thepingster,3,Wed Jun 24 03:03:48 2015 UTC,"If you're ever considering camping in it, keep in mind your backside will get quite cold unless you do something for insulation, even in temperatures as warm as 70*F+.  I use a light sleeping bag, but underquilts are recommended."
Hammocks,3awql9,thepingster,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:30:04 2015 UTC,So if I got an underquilt would it be unneeded weight to bring a sleeping bag? Or vice versa haha or could I use both? Still a little ignorant on the topic.
Hammocks,3awql9,itisnotmybirthday,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:15:27 2015 UTC,"No, you'll typically want an underquilt and topquilt, but a sleeping bag will work in place of a topquilt.  The reason an underquilt is so important is because when you use a sleeping bag, it gets compressed between you and the hammock and loses most of its insulation value.  However, underquilts are typically expensive, so a lot of people will start out sleeping with a sleeping pad inside the hammock.  Personally, I just use a sleeping bag rated to 20*F inside my hammock for temperatures down to 55*F or so, and I don't go out if the nighttime low will be lower than 55*F.  On my last trip, the low was supposed to be about 70*F at night so I only took a cheap, light Walmart sleeping bag that's supposed to be good to 50*F and still had some cold spots."

Hammocks,3at0oz,dmandnm,14,Tue Jun 23 07:22:37 2015 UTC,The shock cord is for holding the net back when it's unzipped[1].

Hammocks,3at0oz,alwaysbevigilant,3,Wed Jun 24 00:47:12 2015 UTC,"There should be a corresponding hoop on the opposite side. Notice the top string that holds the fly net up? Throw it over the top of that string and clip on opposite sides. On the outside, in a similar place, you will find similar stretchy cords which can be connected to your fly, usually doubled back for the right tension.  When you have this all set up under tension it will make the hammock nice and roomy and keep the fly net from drooping in your face. Just note, you connect the internal line once you are tucked inside for the night, then disconnect when you exit in the morning."
Hammocks,3at0oz,frozenthoughts,2,Tue Jun 23 13:43:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  It makes sense now.  Also, like u/HeyRememberThatTime said, using it to keep the thermal pad in place is what they're for.  I looked at the pad on their website and sure enough, there are straps there."
Hammocks,3as0ui,dmandnm,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:18:25 2015 UTC,Love the set up. I'm currently living in Japan and I've got about 3 weeks of travel time planned in late July to August and I was a little curious about the hammock camping while out here.   Did you camp at a sight or were you off the grid for some of your trips? I'm thinking about hiking Fuji and then slowly work my north towards Nagano. Any advice would be awesome!
Hammocks,3as0ui,pkkprotector,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:40:36 2015 UTC,"Taikoma is in the Minami Alps if you want to look it up.  I camped there next to an established campground where some friends were using their tent.  So technically it was off the grid.    Honestly, I'm a little nervous about Fuji right now.  With all that's going on in Hakone and the effort to get Fuji climbers to wear helmets, etc., I think I'd rather hike elsewhere.  Plus, the mountains near Nagano are much more beautiful and provide better hiking.  You should be able to find places to set up your hammock almost anywhere.  I've only had trouble once and it was due to it pouring rain and me just not wanting to fool with it.  I ended up in my bivy that I happened to bring along.  Let me know if you have any questions about locations or anything else."

Hammocks,3as0ui,Sam0ht,2,Mon Jul 6 04:12:36 2015 UTC,"I have no idea if there is a policy against it.  The only issue I can see you having would be finding trees, but that'll be the challenge anywhere you go.  When I've camped I have just found a good spot and set up the hammock and not worried about an established campground.  Additionally, if you find an established campground and it'll work, then just set up.  Don't ask if a hammock is okay.  Don't give them the opportunity to say anything.  Pay your money and drive on."

Hammocks,3aolvy,TehNoff,4,Tue Jun 23 02:20:41 2015 UTC,"A whoopie sling suspension system would probably be slightly lighter than the webbing and buckles - the Warbonnet site says you save about 3oz.  Do you bring other things with you, or just the hammock? Things like a tarp and sleeping arrangements would be a lot easier to lose weight on than the hammock."

Hammocks,3ajb2t,OmwToGallifrey,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:16:23 2015 UTC,"That seems similar in core concept to most of the hammock stands I've seen and used, so it should probably work.   A few ideas: I would consider hanging the suspension straight off the pole, so there are no eye hooks to pull out of the wood. I would probably also fasten the uprights to the wall, or brace them in some way, so nothing falls over due to swinging."
Hammocks,3ajb2t,oversized_hoodie,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:40:59 2015 UTC,"I would consider hanging the suspension straight off the pole   I would go with this approach, too, and I wouldn't tie the pipe into the wood with flanges either.  Check out the Turtledog stand and maybe just go with that to start with if you've got enough room to make that work, or modify the idea to your situation.  Just spitballing... Instead of a fixed connection like a flange between the pipe to the wooden supports, maybe try something more like a saddle that would just support the pipe vertically. Then the pipe would be taking all of the compressive force and you wouldn't be pulling in on the walls of the mobile home at all. You might have too much flex in the pipe to get away with just notching the top of the wooden support, so maybe some sort of bracket there to allow the pipe to flex a bit without pulling off the supports."
Hammocks,3ajb2t,HeyRememberThatTime,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:04:20 2015 UTC,The uprights are lag bolted into place. I think I'm going to go with a suggestion I got elsewhere and use overlapping 2x4s to bridge the gap between the uprights.  I've got some pretty big lag screw hooks that I plan to put into the uprights. I think I'll get a better hang that way since I'll be able to put them at the perfect height for the hang I want and it will make stowing my hammock away easy. I think this will also be a lot more secure since if I were to hang directly from the load bearing beam there would be a lot of stress on whatever I use to connect to the uprights.
Hammocks,3ajb2t,lshiva,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:28:52 2015 UTC,"I would not trust PVC to withstand those forces, especially with a joint in the center and for a long time.  Steel pipe will stand it. Take a look at this: http://theultimatehang.com/2012/07/portable-hammock-pipe-stand/ and consider trying it with modified feet to fit the corner angles that would avoid putting any stress on the walls or require modifying the building."

They are pretty light and very easy to squeeze in/around existing stuff in your pack. They are very ""slippery"" and you can just jam them into little nooks and crannies with sleeping bags, gear, etc. It's a great piece of equipment to keep around.   I wonder how well the fair as an underquilt in terms of warmth. I'd be a little wary of using one if it got below 50. That said, it's an underquilt for like $40. The woobie is good at keeping out wind and water too."

Hammocks,39zajg,FlyingStirFryMonster,2,Tue Jun 16 13:27:52 2015 UTC,"bike choices are really personal. Theres an established set of best choices that I myself mostly ignored. Always remember that in the 70's, people crossed the continent on 3 speeds with milk crates bungied to the sides of the bike...  That being said. I took my road bike because it was 15 pounds lighter than my hybrid. I didn't want to buy a new touring bike, I figured if my road couldn't handle it, Id buy a touring bike somewhere along the way...  Where I did follow the 'establishment' is I bought a brooks B17 saddle and broke it in before I left. For me personally, it was wonderful. Best decision I ever made.  I upgraded the tires to Gatorskinz. Especially since I speant a lot of time on the trans canada trail. I put good heavy duty rim tape inside my rims to help protect my tubes. And I never went anywhere without TWO spare tubes, because trying to find long stem presta tubes in the wilds is damn impossible.  Finally, If i had to do it all over again, I would of replaced the drops with Bull Horns or something. I almost never used the drops, I would of been happier with Bullhorns or Butterflys."

The other side is metal studs and drywall, so I decided to spread the load using 4 1/4"" toggle bolts attached to two strut channels, and bridged the struts with 1.5"" EMT pipe. I've never hung before and wanted some form of adjustment, so with the set up the way it is, I can move the hammock 5"" to 6"" in any direction. Oh and the suspension is two 3.5"" continuous loops made of amsteel that were put through the webbing, and hooked into the carabiners. Definitely wouldn't be my choice for camping, but i like it for ease of use with little variability"

Remember that its important to take nature into consideration when hanging. Make sure to avoid hanging off trees any thinner than the width of a telephone pole. Thinner trees are still growing up and aren't old enough to withstand the force of a v-angle as wide as a hammock produces without negative consequences/effects in the long term of it's growth.

It won't last many trips, but you can also by those 2 dollar mesh things for hanging above beds at dollar stores, cut small holes along the edges, run some paracord though them, so when you put it over your hammock, you pull on the cord and it tightens the net around you, creating a half decent seal.

Hammocks,39hvpd,waznryu,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:37:09 2015 UTC,"This is the first hammock to feature this type of fabric tensioners. The shape is symmetrical so it the user can lie down it it with the head either to the left or the right. The length of the hammock is 11' and the width is 70"". The length helps flatten out the body position which makes this hammock great for sleeping. The ENO double nest is much shorter."

Hammocks,397fj1,Alechilliard5,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:15:38 2015 UTC,I've had the Roo since their Kickstarter campaign and have been really impressed.  I grabbed a 2nd one for the GF too.
Hammocks,397fj1,kirinaz,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:53:32 2015 UTC,"Are you backpacking or just camping?  There's a huge difference.  I have a Roo with the Dragonfly and Python straps and have no problems with it.  What I liked is that I knew exactly what I was getting with the suspension and I didn't have to piece things together.  On that note, I'll say I'm just as happy with my $25 Woot/Amazon deal hammock, adding another $25 for suspension from Dutchware, and using my Dragonfly net until I can get something else.  $80 cheaper between the suspension and hammock, and also over 1/2 lb lighter.  It's also smaller in my pack.    If you're sleeping outside you'll need to look into a rainfly, too, unless you're absolutely sure you won't encounter rain.  I personally use the Hennessy hex rainfly.  I actually have two since I usually go backpacking with someone and let that person use my Skeeter Beeter Pro hammock.  I got the SBP for $40 on an Amazon sale and it came with everything you need to hang, but you should replace the ropes with straps so you don't damage trees.  I think they regularly run around $70.  The SBP has an integrated bug net.  TL;DR: There's nothing wrong with the Roo.  But there's nothing so right about it that you should pay $130 for a hammock with suspension."

Hammocks,394b1p,Snakes_have_legs,13,Tue Jun 9 04:00:46 2015 UTC,"This has nothing to do with hang angle guys. I have a fixed ridge line for a 30 degree hang on my GT ultralight and it will do the same thing if I lay down the middle. Your body weight puts all the tension in the middle of the hammock and creates that ridge.  Put both your feet on one side and swing your upper body to the opposite side (your mid section should still be in the middle). Look up ""diagonal lay"" for more information :-)"
Hammocks,394b1p,MatthewMeredith,2,Tue Jun 9 04:36:21 2015 UTC,"This is definitely how I usually lay in it, normally when I'm sleeping; but in every other Eno hammock I've tried, no one else is having this problem when they lay vertically. In all my friends hammocks, it is still very comfortable to lay that way even though the diagonal method is even better. If I lay diagonally you can still feel that weird tension in the middle of the hammock. I really don't know, it almost feels like a problem with how the hammock itself was constructed. If you look at the knots at both ends of mine, they seem a lot more chaotic than all my other friends' as well."
Hammocks,394b1p,ezshucks,4,Tue Jun 9 04:52:38 2015 UTC,the line is too taught

Hammocks,394b1p,guide42,3,Tue Jun 9 04:21:31 2015 UTC,Ends are probably too close together.
Hammocks,394b1p,guide42,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:23:52 2015 UTC,"That very well could be part of it. I normally do it between a tree and the fence you see in the photo, but slightly farther away usually. I moved the hammock farther away after taking this to where I normally do it and it did improve, but it was still very noticeable.  I'll try looking around for different spots tomorrow to see if it improves."
Hammocks,394b1p,brzcory,3,Tue Jun 9 04:29:19 2015 UTC,Is too tight. You need have 30 degrees between the support and the hammock.  Like this.
Hammocks,394b1p,domtzs,2,Tue Jun 9 04:04:25 2015 UTC,"That's the messed up part though. I've tried every loop on my atlas straps and have gotten it as loose as it can go and it still does this. It didn't used to, either, it only started happening a couple days ago"
Hammocks,394b1p,Isoprenoid,2,Tue Jun 9 04:05:33 2015 UTC,"What did you change a couple days ago?  Also, lay in diagonal."
Hammocks,394b1p,Isoprenoid,3,Tue Jun 9 04:08:55 2015 UTC,"It's the way the ends are cut, sewn, and gathered.   In cheap/ultralight hammocks (like my Grand Trunk Ultralight that I picked up on a whim from Meijers), they just take a perfectly square piece of fabric, sew the nice straight ends over, run cord through it, and gather it together. The problem is that it's still a square piece, with exactly the same end-to-end distance for the sides, and the bottom. Add weight to the bottom, and it's taught, but there's no weight on the sides, so they're loose, and you feel like you're on a tabletop.  On the nicer hammocks (Like the Grand Truck Skeeter Beater that I use for actual camping), they taper the ends so that the sides have less material, and therefore envelop you better (have more material in the center than the sides).   http://imgur.com/0bBUklP  You can lay in the 2 hammocks back-to-back, and there is a VERY pronounced difference between the two. The cheap one is very uncomfortable, and I'd never be able to sleep in it (good for reading a book on my lunch break though, due to quick setup and lightweight). The expensive one is comfy as all fuck, and I sleep in it on a monthly basis with no problems."
Hammocks,394b1p,TXN4L1F3,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:32:34 2015 UTC,"I can confirm this somewhat; have a cheap chinese hammock with these 3 bands of fabric; the middle is always tighter, however not as much as in OP's photo; I do however feel the tension in the stitches between the fabric bands;  lying in a diagonal helps, especially on the foot end, where the weight of my legs puts some tension back into the floppy outer fabric bands; however, I never manage to keep my head inside the hammock, the side just folds. I have been rather successful in laying at the maximum diagonal possible and using a pillow for added stability. Also ridge-line length does play a (minor) role.  I guess I could add some folding at the ends, but since I'm really tall I feel this would create other problems related to the hammock length this time."
Hammocks,394b1p,Orange_C,2,Wed Jun 10 14:45:33 2015 UTC,"Check how the end is being gathered into a bunch. I think this happened to be when I simply grabbed it into a bunch and put a knot at the end.  What I did to solve mine was I did a zig-zag fold before I gathered it into a knot.  Or maybe it was the other way around. Either way, check to see how the end is gathered."

Hammocks,394b1p,aidanpryde18,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:11:29 2015 UTC,"Just try bunching it up in a different way and see if it changes it, you'll be surprised how much of a difference it can make."
Hammocks,394b1p,aidanpryde18,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:43:27 2015 UTC,"Butt positioning can help with this. Move your butt closer to the head of the hammock, the foot, or slightly left or right. Play around with it and you may find the ridge disappears."
Hammocks,394b1p,aidanpryde18,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:31:16 2015 UTC,"Maybe add a structural ridgeline, with an adjustable bury on one/both ends? Solves the issue of inconsistent hangs rather nicely, once you have it dialed in."
Hammocks,394b1p,Purple-Is-Delicious,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:06:01 2015 UTC,"So recently every time I've gone hammocking with my friends, my hammock has just felt... Off... Compared to my friends'. It's like all the tension has given out along the sides and the middle part has gained all of it. Rather than being a nice snug pouch like any other hammock, it feels like you're laying down on a really tense piece of fabric with two loose pieces next to you. Its almost Impossible to get comfortable while lying down normally. Is there any way to fix this, or am I just crazy and nothing is really wrong?"

Hammocks,394b1p,TitsNGritz,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:04:47 2015 UTC,"Never had an ENO, so I'm just assuming that they're suspended by a channel on the end of the hammock. I'm wondering if that channel hasn't gotten twisted or something that it causing the extra pull down the center. You might try loosening the cord that holds the gather and making sure the the fabric is evenly bunched and that the loop is in the center of the gather and not off to one side or something.  Sorry if that's not totally clear. If it's not, I'll try and rephrase it."

Even if only one in a hundred people go into the wilderness (it's higher in my area, maybe lower in others), it's still a relatively big part of our experience. There are very few bear attacks, even considering the millions of people who spend time in the wilderness across the US.   There are hundreds of domestic animal attacks every day, which is thousands of times the rate of ""bear attacks"" that happen."

Hammocks,38z892,squeaki,2,Mon Jun 8 14:56:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah there was a small newspaper article a few years ago about a man being attacked in his sleeping bag at night somewhere near the feather river (in northern california near where I live) by a mountain lion). Until then I had comforted myself by thinking that they only seemed to attack joggers and small children etc, or mountain bikers (I figured small darting moving things like cats are wont to attack :o) and that I was probably pretty safe, being about as far from ""fast and darting"" as a a fat old person can be :o. So this story of someone being attacked in his sleeping bag quite concerned me. I never saw any follow up with more details (the article stated he was able to fight it off and make it out to medical help), when I'd periodically do a google search. Something in the original article made me think he was a fisherman so I was hoping he had been using his fish for a pillow or something.  edit: spelled a word wrong that changed everything"

Hammocks,38z892,TankerX,3,Mon Jun 8 18:01:08 2015 UTC,"I got woken up (this time last year) by being bumped by a passing female black bear at 4.30am precisely here. I had a friend camping nearby who had ALL of his food eaten/bags/tent destroyed by the bear. All I lost was my breakfast apple up a distant tree, he lost $80 of groceries, and most of his gear. It was a shit scary moment on waking up, but once I realised it was headed for my apple- i.e away from me- I just kept quiet and watched the beautiful terrifyingly large creature munch breakfast. It scampered off toward the highway shortly afterwards, at which point I quickly went to check on my pals, and then in turn the more distant campers around in the forest.  Edit/TL;DR I was in my hammock, I peeked out over the edge to see a black bear munching my apple."

Hey, as a side question, for day hikes I know a lot of people bring their Mora Bushcraft Survival knife, which I do sometimes and will probably do tomorrow, but do you think just bringing a multitool is better? Or save the multitool for multiday hikes (or overnighters) when weight is more an issue?"
Hammocks,38z892,Christof3,2,Wed Jun 10 02:48:31 2015 UTC,I almost always bring my mora knife. The only time I leave my mora at home is when i'm trying be ultralight and do 15-18 miles a day. For those extremely long hikes I only bring a small multitool so I can keep my nails clean and file them down.

Hammocks,38z892,rhizopogon,14,Mon Jun 8 19:57:20 2015 UTC,I know we'd all like to tell ourselves that - but it's not necessarily true. Black bears DO attack humans for food. It's not at all common but it does happen.   Lone male black bears do carry out predatory attacks on humans.   http://www.adn.com/article/lone-predatory-black-bears-responsible-most-human-attacks
Hammocks,38z892,mrjowee,1 point,Mon Jun 8 11:33:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it's the most likely reason for the attack but it must be acknowledged. An attack last September in New Jersey was a much more clear predatory attack. They do happen.  No, I don't know this was a predatory attack. Probably wasn't. But neither do you know that all the attacks you cite were based on the scents the victims were carrying. Why make a victim-blaming assumption when there are clearly other possibilities?"
Hammocks,38z892,Redrustycar,3,Mon Jun 8 13:34:36 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's a very rare event.  In fact, it's the first time I've ever heard of it happening.  We've all heard of bears going into a tent to look for food, disturbing the sleeping campers, but I'd never heard of one being actually dragged out of a hammock.  The fact that the kid only had ""lacerations"" indicates that he had no bites, and I'd bet the injuries were only obtained because the bear was ""digging"" at him trying to find the food it smelled.  Maybe his clothes smelled of food?"

Hammocks,38gsun,KAZtheAntagonist,2,Fri Jun 5 01:18:28 2015 UTC,Paracord = bad. Paracord is designed to stretch. Buy some amsteel for hammock suspension and pair that with some polyester webbing (tree straps). Or you can just go with polyester webbing itself
Hammocks,38gsun,Tridickatops,0,Fri Jun 5 04:49:11 2015 UTC,"I think the claws will weaken it after awhile, but I doubt it will be a huge deal.   Double or triple up the paracord, and you will be fine."
Hammocks,38gsun,Roomslinger,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:35:01 2015 UTC,What do you mean by doubling or tripling the cord? Just want to cover my bases. It said that it's rated for 400 pounds so I figured it should be fine.
Hammocks,38gsun,storl,4,Thu Jun 4 04:17:19 2015 UTC,Paracord ratings are for static (not moving) weight.  Your getting in and out and moving around is dynamic weight.  Triple up or get cord or straps rated to hold you.
Hammocks,38gsun,arabchic,2,Thu Jun 4 04:38:46 2015 UTC,knots weaken rope
Hammocks,38gsun,BeastroMath,2,Thu Jun 4 19:22:14 2015 UTC,"The weight you put on the cord is greater than just half your weight (due to the geometry).  Even the real 550 cord is often inadequate. Furthermore, paracord is very stretchy (as is any nylon suspension), you will probably find yourself creeping toward the ground when you hang for long enough.  For these reasons, it is frowned upon for suspension. But honestly, if it works for you, then go for it."
Hammocks,38gsun,Roomslinger,2,Thu Jun 4 22:32:53 2015 UTC,"I'd use two/three lengths of paracord on each side (rather than one) to tie the hammock to your anchor. It's cheap, and redundancy is better than knocking your head on the floor if the cord gets nicked or wears at some point. I have no doubt a single line could hold, but I would worry about it holding for a long duration."

Hammocks,388xxh,batquux,3,Tue Jun 2 18:13:05 2015 UTC,"It's a feature of the FitBit.  Sleep tracking.  You put the thing into a cuff on the wrist of your non-dominant hand, and put it in sleep tracking mode.  Basically it detects movement, probably over a certain threshold, and uses that data to analyze how restless you were over that period.  As you can see, I was restless twice...once in the middle of the night as is indicated by that light blue band, which was probably nothing more than moving my arm, and once in the morning when I got up to pee.

Like watching TV, reading books, eating, studying, etc?  IIRC about 90% of insomnia is actually ""trained insomnia"" where you subconsciously associate your bed with activities besides sleeping.  It's been shown that if you stop doing non-sleeping things in your bed, you can retrain your brain to associate your bed only with sleeping, thus reducing insomnia.  May be worth a shot."

Hammocks,386fm5,MafiaZac,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:23:27 2015 UTC,Love em. I usually only ever use them for camping and not going out for hangs during the day so they get little sun exposure. Or I'll use them for this because I trust them much more than atlas straps.  Highly recommend.

Hammocks,37z4g5,NarwhalSquadron,3,Mon Jun 1 14:04:57 2015 UTC,"sounds awesome! how far away from civilization were you? how often did you resupply?  also, if I understand correctly your tarp is suspended from the hammock line? how does the difference in tension between an unloaded and loaded hammock affect tarp tension/setup? doesn't it go all slack when you leave the hammock?"
Hammocks,37z4g5,secret_tiger101,2,Sun May 31 20:50:16 2015 UTC,"If I understand correctly, the ridgeline now has the tension of the hammock, so it will be pulled taught whether the hammock is occupied or not. The hammock will hang below the ridgeline and will not change slack/tension whether it's occupied or not, because all tension, even that caused by the weight of the person in the hammock, is now transferred to the ridgeline."

I have a hammock bliss net that I use in the summer.  It's heavy, but long enough for my 10 footer and cocoons the whole hammock.   I'm in Florida, the mosquitos and yellow flies are fierce down here.  If I were backpacking further north, I'd probably uise a fronkey style."

I can't find much of anyone saying anything about this hammock online so I wanted to share my thoughts.    I currently have 4 hammocks, and I think this might be my favorite.  My other 3 are Kammok Roo, Grand Trunk Skeeter Beeter Pro, and my indoor Vivere with stand.  I was disappointed that it didn't come with at least something to hang with.  Out of the bag, it has some sort of webbing that is sewn to form a loop in the gathered end channels and that is it.  I had seen the other Yukon hammocks on Woot several times but always discarded them as being a great deal because of their length.  When this went up for $25, it was hard to pass up, and I'm glad I didn't.  The length and width both seem just about perfect.  I haven't used it on a backpacking trip yet, but it'll probably be replacing the Roo in my bag (and saving me about 10oz).  I wish I could report how it is to sleep in, but my neighbors are all too noisy.    And for you ultralight guys, here it is on the scale bouncing between 413 and 414 grams.  My Roo weights in at 675g with the carabiners.  My SBP weights in at 976g with carabiners and rope."
Hammocks,37stwm,fromkentucky,2,Sat May 30 02:54:13 2015 UTC,"Here buddy…   Buy a pair of these in 10ft length, and a pair of these on the 8"" Continuous Loops.   Wrap the strap around the tree and pull the tail through the loop, like this, then feed the tail through the buckle like this and pull tight.  If you want to lose a little more weight and bulk, ditch the ropes and metal carabiners, and feed the 8"" Continuous Loops through the end channels of the hammock, kinda like this.  It's a great system, easy to set up, lightweight and holds tight."

Edit: I guess shorter straps would be fine with the extra length of the whoopies. I'll order one of these, too. I'd think a drip line would be easier on whoopies than straps, though I'd prefer to just avoid the rain. Thanks again."
Hammocks,37stwm,fromkentucky,2,Sun May 31 19:27:44 2015 UTC,"The Whoopies are pretty long.

This sounds like some hardcore minimalism and I am intrigued. That over cover just looks like it would be a pain in the ass and not needed if you have a tarp. It probably won't get cool for a few months if the humidity is anything like Houston, so I wouldn't worry about an underquilt for a while. It takes about 24 hours for them to let you post on the hammock forums."
Hammocks,37neyd,OVNEV,2,Fri May 29 12:49:14 2015 UTC,I read a great tip on how to stay clean when living outdoors on another sub. It said just subscribe to a $10/month gym and use their showers in the morning.
Hammocks,37neyd,azitapie,2,Thu Jun 4 22:06:26 2015 UTC,"Check out the Warbonnet Blackbird XLC. It is the most comfortable hammock I've ever been in. It has a removable bugnet,a shelf, footbox, and (you have to order it when you place the initial order as it has to be made with the hammock) a solid cover as well to become a true cocoon. Well worth the money spent IMO.   Check it out hur: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jU8mzz3xJk"
Hammocks,37neyd,JP50515,2,Fri May 29 03:11:03 2015 UTC,"I've never slept in a bridge personally, but at my regular group hang, a lot of people have been swearing by and switching to bridge hammocks lately. The Warbonnet Ridgerunner is especially popular.   Overcovers are mainly for warmth because they trap a bit more air and minimize convective loss over the top. They are not a replacement for a good tarp. If you were to go with the Blackbird XLC and think you might do some winter hanging, I would definitely pick up the overcover since you can't order it later. I use an overcover on my BIAS hammock and it makes a noticeable difference in winter. Definitely get some sort of insulation underneath of you. Your friend is correct. It is surprising how ""warm"" it can be outside and still be cold in a hammock due to the air pulling the heat out of your body. A sleeping bag will work in a pinch, but they can be a pain to zip in and out of while in a hammock.  Depending on the weight of your bag, I would not keep it in the shelf. The shelf is designed to hold a couple of personal items like a headlamp and a book. If you want to keep your bag off the ground, look into a gear sling. It connects to either end of your suspension and keeps your bag underneath the hammock.  As for a double layer, they do allow more weight, but their main purpose is to hold a sleeping pad in between the two layers for insulation. The hammock will lay the same whether it's a single or a double layer. If you don't want to splurge for an underquilt, a double layer hammock and a thin foam pad are very comfortable, but since the foam pad doesn't breathe, there is a chance for condensation building on top of the pad overnight. I try to only use mine in the winter, when the humidity is low so I don't wake up with a swampy back. For summer, you don't need much of an underquilt. I use a PLUQ under mine and it is comfortable by itself from summer down into the mid 40's. Lower than that and I add my pad and am good into the low 20's.  Easiest suspension would be the warbonnet cinch buckle suspension, with a dutch clip or carabiner on the tree end of the tree strap. Whoopie suspensions are lighter and more compact, but in my experience, they are more fidgety to get setup right and seem to take longer."
Hammocks,37nwg3,jackglenton,7,Fri May 29 00:51:35 2015 UTC,"Shug's videos are often linked here.  He has tons and tons of hammock related content on his channel, and it seems to be top notch info from what I can tell.    That said, hammock camping is basically the same as tent camping in that --other than the hammock and suspension -- you need shelter, bottom insulation, and top insulation.  To get into hammock camping, you can spend very little or very much depending on what your needs are.    Hammock:  If you have access to a sewing machine, DIY hammocks are very very easy and cheap.  There are loads of tutorials all over the internet (hammockforums.com is great too).  Did a no-sew version from a taffeta table cloth.  It's not as light as nylon and other materials, but it's effectively the same.  The DIY option is maybe attractive due to your height...trust me when I say you will want an 11 foot hammock in order to be comfortable (they are commercially available, but you might have to look a bit harder).   Suspension:  Typically consists of two distinct parts. A ""tree hugger"" which is just a strap that wraps around the tree...this prevents damage to the bark and is very much needed to maintain sustainable/responsible hammocking in public places.  Second is the bit of suspension that connects the hammock end to the tree strap.  There are umpteen ways to accomplish this.  Best advise is to search /r/hammocks and /r/hammockcamping and hammockforums.com for the different styles.   Shelter:  Most commonly a tarp.  These can be simple rectangle (or hung like a diamond), hexagonal, catenary cut.  There are dozens of cottage industry sites making really sweet gear.  Depending on budget, the can be purchased or made from silnylon, silpoly, or cuban fiber (silnylon easily the most common).  You can just use a plain old ""blue tarp"" or painters drop cloth or Tyvek if you just want to try it out for cheap.   Bottom Insulation:  Commonly called an ""Under Quilt"" or UQ.  Unless you are sleeping above ~60o, you will need insulation on your backside.  The easiest is simply a foam sleeping pad.  You CANNOT just curl up in your sleeping bag.  The hammock compresses the insulation under you and you lose most all of its insulating properties.  Thus, a true UQ is suspended under the hammock.  You can easily modify a surplus poncho liner, or get fancy with down UQ's (again, tons of cottage industry and DIY options).   Top Insulation:  Hey guess what? Called a ""Top Quilt"" or TQ.  Here is where you can just use your usual sleeping bag.     So ya, check out Shug's vidoes above. There is a decent wiki in this sub.  I found justjeff's site to be helpful in visualizing suspension techniques and also diy hammock stuff.  Lastly, hammockforums.net is one of the most active hammocking discussions out there."

A good beginners hammock that can hang around a long time (pun intended) is the Kammock Roo. That was my first hammock and it still comes with me occasionally. It's about $100.

Hammocks,37nwg3,RiotShaven,3,Fri May 29 13:54:32 2015 UTC,"Good marketing I guess? I started with ENO because they had the OneLink system (which i found out about on Youtube, presumably from a paid/donated review) which was easier and cheaper to consume.  I didn't know a lot, and it was simple to buy just one thing rather than piece together 4.  Also, you can get them at the more common box stores in the US (REI, Gander Mountain, etc)"
Hammocks,37nwg3,FeedMeCletus,4,Fri May 29 14:02:15 2015 UTC,"I think that's the real reason. They are available locally to most. They are also the Go-to at music festivals and other such hippie gatherings and get a huge amount of unpaid advertising that way. They are  however terrible to sleep in, break easily and are imo just not a well made hammock."
Hammocks,37nwg3,JP50515,2,Fri May 29 14:26:53 2015 UTC,"I dunno, at the end of the day it's just another parachute material hammock. I slept in one every night for about 7 months and loved it.

Hammocks,37g62r,NerdMachine,3,Wed May 27 17:42:25 2015 UTC,"Congratulations.  Looks cozy.  The foam mat combined with the underquilt will definitely make you sweaty.  A pad doesn't breath, but by itself at least vents around the edges a bit.  When your underquilt comes up the sides, it really traps the moisture.  You're usually better off with one or the other in above-freezing weather.  It took me a few trips before I figured that out.  I was sold on hammock camping the first time I tried it.  I had NEVER slept so well when camping.  As a side-sleeper, it was like night and day.  I woke up feeling fantastic instead of like I was beaten with a baseball bat."

Hammocks,37g62r,Raphaelion,2,Wed May 27 22:05:04 2015 UTC,"If I'm looking at the right hammock, it's only 2.7m/8'-9"" long.  That's pretty short, especially to get the proper diagonal lay.  Most of the recommended hammocks in the U.S. are 3m/10'.  And even those start to get short if you're more than 6 feet tall.  I'm 6'-2"" and find anything under a 3.35m/11' length gives me a calf ridge issue, which is what you're describing.  I'm not sure what shipping to the U.K. would be like, but Dutchware makes my favorite netless hammock.  And Warbonnet makes my favorite netted hammock.  Both come in longer lengths.  If you haven't found it, drop by Hammockforums.net.  The wealth of knowledge and helpful people over there is amazing.

Hammocks,378vcd,ampersand38,3,Mon May 25 20:45:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think you want to tie the hammock directly to the tripods at all. Too much of the force will be pulling inward on them that way. Google ""turtledog hammock stand"" for a working design that's more or less exactly what you're going for here.  The difference is that it suspends the hammock from a length of rigid pipe, and hangs the pipe from the tripods. That way the pipe is taking all the inward force, and the force translated to the tripods is straight down."
Hammocks,378vcd,HeyRememberThatTime,0,Mon May 25 22:17:52 2015 UTC,"I did see that design. I was hoping to avoid suspending a long rigid bar in the build, that's why I shifted the bar to act on the bottom of the tripod."

I am also thinking about making it so I can attach a water source and have it mist for summer time.   The big question for me is if the PVC will be solid enough.

Hammocks,378vcd,MDiddy,3,Sat May 30 03:00:36 2015 UTC,"Like mrjowee mentioned....you want to go for the Turtle dog stand style.  The way you have it, the force down of you being in the hammock will translate to lateral force on the stands.  So, if you place a lateral bar between the two stands, you place the lateral force on the bar, which then prevents it's compression.  This way, the only force that acts on the stands is downward."
Hammocks,378vcd,greaterscott,2,Tue May 26 00:57:04 2015 UTC,"Short answer: No  Long Answer: Attaching a hammock to the top of the stand will cause the 2 ends to tilt in and break the joint on the crossbar if it is not INCREDIBLY strong. This could be remedied by bracing all 3 legs on each side of the stand to the crossbar and using a bulky crossbeam, or by moving the crossbar to the top of the assembly. As others have said, look up turtledog stands for some guidance"

Step 1: Wait like a tiger in the bushes outside your local outdoors equipment retailer for down filled sleeping bags to go on sale. (Look for an extra long one for tall people).  Step 2: Pounce on that deal such as the aforementioned tiger would.   Step 3: Buy some paracord.  Step 4: Sew the paracord to the bag using pennies as your wrapped in grommets  Step 5: Trim the excess fabric around the head and make a hammock sized hole adjoining to the zipper at the foot. Sew carefully.   Step 5: Tie small prusik knots around tiny climbing rings and make the same prusik on the load ropes for your hammock.   Step 6:  Now get in and furgle around in your fancy hammock cocoon.

Hammocks,373105,NerdMachine,3,Sun May 24 11:54:31 2015 UTC,"I have two home-made hammocks that I use quite often, and have lasted me for years.  I have others that I use less often, including a couple that I made last year, but let's talk about the ""long lasting"" ones.    Right now, my wife is hanging in one that we made, oh, 8 years ago.  It uses a 1"" channel on the end, with a cord running through the channel.  It's just like the popular hammocks sold by ENO.  I used $1 per yard 1.9 oz ripstop nylon that I bought from a clearance rack at Walmart.  This hammock gets regular, daily use in my home.  Another hammock that I use often is made from nylon taffeta that I bought a Hancock Fabrics for $3.40 per yard.  It has a nicer feel to it, and I made the hammock a bit oversized.  For this hammock, I hand-stitched the hems along the sides, and folded over the ends for a ""Sheet bend"" knot.  I heated the ragged ends after tying the knot to prevent fraying, but other than that, did nothing to them.  I have also used the ""gathered end and larks head"" method, and I like that method a lot.  It seems to be the method that might do the least amount of wear on the fabric, and I've taken to using that method on my newer hammocks.  But, honestly, I have not had any problem with any of the methods used so far.  I can supply pictures if you want, but I'm sure you already have an idea what I'm talking about."
Hammocks,373105,deck_hand,1 point,Sun May 24 14:46:29 2015 UTC,Are there any types that have a ring or similar sewn onto the hammock itself?
Hammocks,373105,deck_hand,2,Sun May 24 16:29:36 2015 UTC,"If you want a ""ring"" or something, there are a couple of decent alternative concepts.  One could, for instance, sew a pocket into the end of the hammock, similar to the way most commercial hammocks have, and instead of running cord through the pocket, put a large carabiner through it.  This would have the effect of reducing the chance that a cord would cut through the cloth of the pocket.  But, it would also just increase the weight and bulk of the hammock when compared with the gathered end and lark's head technique, without providing any superior protection.  What is the worry, or risk that you are trying to solve?"

Hammocks,36msyi,ShooTa666,0,Thu May 21 12:24:07 2015 UTC,That seems right.  Looks a lot like my ultralight backpacker asym zip.  Great hammock.

Right now I have a big 3 x 4,5m tarp, but I am also looking for something that's easier to carry, and that tarp seems about right. Is it possible to for example cook under it or is it only big enough for the hammock?"
Hammocks,36my98,jonscrew,3,Wed May 20 15:48:08 2015 UTC,"I'd strongly recommended looking into tree straps and not using rope, it can damage the trees cambium layer under the bark and it's vital to the trees circulatory and feeding system. ENO makes some that you can find about anywhere that would be a good match for you. That one tree by your foot end looks dead or dying and that's another issue to be avoided."

Hammocks,36hn9z,elevatedmovemENT,1 point,Wed May 20 19:50:48 2015 UTC,"No Seeum Mesh runs about $3 a yard.  Bugnets use 7-8 yards.   Material costs alone are $21-24 and that't not including sewing, labor, shock cord, or cord locks.    You'll be hard pressed to find anything under $40-45 and it is a worth while investment, $45 isn't that much at all.   But if you need it to be cheap, grab a head net and wear long sleeves and pants to bed.  Then save up for a real bugnet."

I built my first one without having ever sewn before and the guides on DIY gear supply helped a lot. I can't really comment on the extra width yet, I'm almost done with my extra wide hammock but it's not quite done yet. I built my first hammock with lime green edges and a black middle and it made it look a lot better in general with multiple colors so you could just keep some of the extra fabric on the sides for a wider hammock without any extra work. The gear sacks will come in handy and are even easier to sew so you should get some good practice on those. I definitely messed up a couple times sewing my first hammock but it was nothing serious and it has been working fine for about a year now. You should have no problem sewing yours!"

You can usually only do this by sleeping head toe style. but its not gonna be a love machine type situation. I won't sleep with my wife in the same hammock.  If you buy a stand you will end up paying about 100-150 for the stand alone, and even many of these are not perfect, but you can get a fair one on amazon. I have yet to find one I really like.  Underquilt may not be necessary if you keep your place at 70 degrees F. If it gets much colder you may be able to make one yourself by hanging a blanket under, there are quite a few DIY youtube videos.  I like a down pillow but whatever fits your back and neck.  Bottom line, Eno is a really good entry hammock and ENO makes a wall mount. I think you should reconsider hanging it in your studs. You could use a stud finder and hang it within 20 minutes. When you move out, throw some wall putty or filler and a light touch of paint over it and bam you are done."

Unfortunately this is the kind of apartment complex that'll notice that stuff and I'd rather not mess with the walls, etc.  My budget is up to $800 but honestly even if I hate it I'm cool with throwing away around $400 into this so buying a stand and stuff isn't a big deal for me. However if I could potentially make a stand out of wood that is better than something I can buy then I could also do that to save money and potentially get a higher quality stand.  An underquilt or something similar may be a necessity then, I suppose I'll cross that bridge when I get there though.  As far as sleeping with someone in a hammock, I expect it to not be terribly comfortable but I expect it'll happen as this type of thing is definitely a rarity around here and women will be curious."

I used 1.25"" pipe and 36"" pipe sections so I can take it with me in my Jeep Wrangler when I want to hang someplace without trees. This weekend will be my first major trip with the stand. I use an Eno doublenest and Blaze Underquilt. I bought the Blaze because I normally camp in the Midwest around Memorial Day until early October and wanted the ability to sleep outside during that time-frame. Also I can keep my thermostat low in the winter and still be warm at night. I ended up using a fleece blanket hung over my structural ridge-line like a tarp when it was below zero this winter. When I want to side sleep I use a normal bed pillow to support my head. I own a king sized bed but really only sleep in it when I have company. I sleep better in my hammock and feel more rested. I also placed some rubber strips under the feet since I have hard wood floors."

Seems sturdy and well made, and it's definitely comfortable for someone our height.  If you hit the sale, it's quite inexpensive, too.  Your budget is extremely high for a hammock setup.  With some judicious shopping you could get a real Mayan hammock, from local artisans, for well under $100.  Hammocks really don't cost all that much.  That leaves you quite a lot for a stand."

They have an active community and plenty of advice for full time bed replacement.  My humble advice: don't buy a (ultra?)lite camping hammock from woot and expect it to last more than a few months full timing ... It was great at first, but recently I've had some nasty lower back stiffness/pain. Replaced it with a more recent purchase from woot that's less comfortable for sleeping, but noticeably flatter/supportive lay... The first one seems to have stretched from use over 6ish months (6'4"" x 190lb for context)  Edit: Also, consider building your own stand. It'll cost about the same as a retail one, but it will be far superior build quality compared to most anything on the market.  Pipe will be easy to assemble, but expensive. Wood will cost less but require more tools/effort to build."

Home Depot will cut it to size for you, and then it's just a matter of screwing it together. Not tools necessary. Also, if you use a design with the long beam going over instead of under you can slap a T junction in the center and attach a monitor mount. Combined with a Chromecast you can stream video and easily watch tv while hanging."
Hammocks,36ea0u,RojoNinja,1 point,Tue May 19 14:12:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah I just need to decide how I want to do this. I like the idea of wood since I can stain it and make it look nice, pipe is gonna be pretty rugged no matter what. However pipe will be easier to transport/assemble whereas wood may require me to bring all the pieces into the apartment and then use power tools or something to assemble them and get sawdust everywhere.  Gotta think about it more before I make any decision"
Hammocks,36ea0u,Roomslinger,2,Wed May 20 00:01:50 2015 UTC,"The pipe style is heavy, and could really do with a coat of paint or something unless you don't mind the industrial look. The big advantage to me is the simplicity. The cost was pretty low too compared to a retail hammock stand."
Hammocks,36ea0u,Roomslinger,1 point,Wed May 20 00:08:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah I just pieced out what I'd need to do it in wood and I'm looking at:   2 2x4 12' 2 2x4 8' 1 4x4 8' 2 4x4 6' posts 2 3"" J lag screws (unless there's a better thing to use to hang it up) 16 or so 3/8x8.5-8"" bolts accompanying washers/nuts paint, stain probably isn't gonna look good on Pine   So all in all to build this in wood I think it'll be somewhere between $100-150, I think pipe at these specifications will run me more around the $200 range but I may be mistaken. Pipe will definitely be easier to do overall but I'm fine with putting some elbow grease for a more aesthetically pleasing product since it'll be inside all the time."

Hammocks,36ea0u,jnux,1 point,Wed May 20 01:56:37 2015 UTC,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AXN3628/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1  I have this one and I like it a lot. Recently it's become a little uncomfortable because I thought I could get away with putting it through a drier (don't.) You might want an underquilt in the winter, but I could never get one strung up that didn't restrict the movement of the hammock and made do by wrapping myself up in a duvet. I like using a thin pillow but I don't think it matters.  You're really not going to want to sleep with another person in a hammock. Napping or cuddling is fine, but it's going to squish you together and be really uncomfortable for long term sleeping.   Also, people on here frequently recommend getting camping hammocks for indoor sleeping and I think it's a terrible idea. Nylon just isn't as comfortable as cotton and sleeping in it on a daily basis would make me miserable. It'd be like replacing your blankets with a sleeping bag."
Hammocks,36ea0u,whabt,1 point,Mon May 18 22:44:43 2015 UTC,"I second this one, just switched to it a couple months ago after sleeping in an ENO doublenest for the past 2 years or so, cotton is way more comfortable for every night sleep.

I was looking at things similar to this as what I'll probably try out, although I'm definitely a little sketched that no one seems to know about the website.  Would it be a bad idea to just kinda lay some blankets on top of the hammock instead of using an underquilt?  Sorry for taking so long to respond, just got back from work/gym"
Hammocks,36ea0u,Hinin,2,Mon May 18 23:57:29 2015 UTC,I have a down blanket I folded in half and just lay on top of.  It's been fine down to about 55 degrees (indoors).   Worth a try before you monkey around with rigging an underquilt.

Hammocks,35qnlf,counsel8,2,Tue May 12 18:38:42 2015 UTC,All you need to make a hammock is a straight stitch. Don't sweat it.
Hammocks,35qnlf,swampwalker906,2,Wed May 13 00:37:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a strait stitch is  fine. I made a gathered end out of a table cloth and used 3 single stitches across the ends and its solid as a rock.   Tip.. Use good thread. It's worth a couple of extra bucks to get some upholstery or heavy duty stuff."
Hammocks,35qnlf,Roomslinger,2,Wed May 13 05:13:14 2015 UTC,"+1 for thread quality. The Thread Exchange has some great resources for choosing threads based on application, strength requirements, and other factors. They also sell small 2oz & 4oz spools, which might be perfect for the DIY project. Remember that strong seams have a lot to do with individual stitch length and proper top thread/bobbin tensioning in addition to thread diameter and construction (bond, twist, etc).  I've heard it's not necessary to use thread that is considerably stronger than the base fabric material, but I'd much rather the fabric fail before my stitches fail. I use T-69 at the triple-straight-stitched gathered ends, and we've never seen pull-out or rips, but this is almost definitely overkill. Just remember not to buy a thread that won't fit through your needle! The Thread Exchange guides can definitely help with that, also."

When I was shopping for stronger thread to hold on a button that kept falling off she said ""Do you want to sew the button on (for even me only a 5 min or less job) or fix a tear in the shirt?""   She is way smarter than I, I also apply this to DIY stuff.   If the thread gives out I sew another seam if the fabric tears I make another hammock...."
Hammocks,35pj3p,dustybizzle,2,Tue May 12 13:31:19 2015 UTC,how do you attach your hammock to the wall in your house? I'm thinking of doing similar in our new flat.  Very cute btw
Hammocks,35pj3p,Biqh,1 point,Sun May 17 20:55:09 2015 UTC,"We used eye bolts, and pre drilled holes that were smaller in diameter than the bolts, directly into the studs. Used a studfinder (highly recommended, as it also found electrical wires in some spots so we knew where not to drill) and attached to the corner of the living room walls where it's double studded, and above the corner of the opposite picture window where there is extra reinforcement.  If I were to do it again, I would use a bit that was a little closer in size to the bolts (while still being smaller so that the threads have something to grab), as the one I used was only about half of the diameter, and when I screwed the bolts in there was some cracking in the studs.   Make sure you get a good sized eye bolt as well, I believe mine was 1/2"", which was the largest they sold at my local hardware store.  And thanks :)"

It's not the width that's an issue; most are more than 110"" apart at the anchor points. the issue is a matter of height. These stands are made to hang a spreader-bar style net hammock that's hung extremely taut. With an 11' hammock, many of these simply won't be tall enough to get a good hang.   You can modify them, but it may not be worth it. I bought a cheap steel tube stand on Amazon for about $50. The width was fine, but it was a few feet too short. I was able to extend the arms with 3/4"" galvanized pipe from work, and it's high enough now but crazy wide (it won't fit in the house without taking up a whole room). Also galvanized pipe isn't exactly cheap, so without access to it (and the hardware) for free you might be better off just building something from scratch."

Hammocks,358jhz,mrjowee,1 point,Fri May 8 01:59:58 2015 UTC,"This is really great for building community building and awareness for hammocks and i love the spirit of the video but to some degree i feel like setting up multiple hammocks on two trees is somehow putting some serious strain some of those trees.   avg person probably weighs 150 times 10 people that's 1500 lbs, put that into that hammock calculator for sheer force and you get like 1300 lbs of sheer force on each tree. Then again its spread out over the course of its height. But more weight added higher up the tree could be worse for the tree because of the leverage aspect.   I love hammocks and the outdoors and want it all to be there when my great grand kids want to go hammock camping. I worry that the multiple hammock practice is a little irresponsible to the nature of LNT.   However, i may just be totally wrong and the force of all that is still nothing in comparison to the amount the tree is able to handle. Also it's probably not that common of a practice to warrant the danger.   I think probably 4-5 hammocks seems totally fine if the tree's are big enough. What do you guys think about multiple hammocks on one set of trees?  (Sorry for the stream of consciousness there, its early for me.)"

Hammocks,358y3l,StumpyMcStump,3,Fri May 8 12:05:44 2015 UTC,"Heres my issue with this strap topic. A hammock with the average person weights about 200lbs, and you may spend 8hours a day sitting in it if out camping. The big problem everyone has is it will kill the tree. The issue I'm having is i grew up very poor and dryers were not a common item in my home. We hung everyones clothes ( 4kids, and 2 adults) on a clothes line probably 3-4 times a week for the entire day. Three loads of wet clothes probably weights a decent amount. On each end of the clothes line was a nice little tree with ROPE tied around it. 20 yrs later those trees are still standing and healthy. This was with everyday use and with ropes. If that didnt damage the tree i doubt my 170lb ass will. Im a hands on person and my test have proven to have no impact.   On a side note bring the down votes because I'm some stupid ass noob going against the grain."

Hammocks,358y3l,Fameiscomin,-4,Fri May 8 11:00:16 2015 UTC,"It's called the cambium layer. The bark on the outside of the tree protects the living cambium layer that lies just underneath. It is the cambium layer that produces the growth rings inside the tree, adding new layers of phloem and xylem each season.  If mice or rabbits chew away the bark exposing the cambium layer, that layer will dry out and die. If the tree is completely girdled this way, it will likely die since it cannot transport nutrients from the roots up to the leaves.  Do a little research before spouting your ignorance."

Tend to just throw a tarp over a rope or sleeping bag on the ground. It's two poles (one long by the front and one short in the back) but staking is what holds it together. That being said, it only does as well as the wind allows. Used it once during a mild rain and it worked fine, but wouldn't use it for anything past a moderate rain. Flip side is it's super light weight and incredibly easy to set up. Probably made for backpacking more than anything. Despite its flaws, I still like it."""

Hammocks,34sg0a,Costumegeek,3,Mon May 4 04:10:33 2015 UTC,"I've slept in a Vivere on its stand for most of the last 8 months.  I find that for the height I hang it at, a bit too much of the gathered strands are over the bar and as a result it doesn't swing much.  This isn't too much of an issue for sleeping, but when I hang outside from trees, I find that swinging on a longer nylon hammock is much more comfortable.  If I had the room indoors, or needed a stand outdoors, I'd want a longer, taller stand which could fit the full length of the hammock to the knot/gathering between the posts, maybe one of the 15 foot stands might be tall enough.    The Vivere hammock itself is comfortable enough, though I have only used it on the stand.  I'm down 90+ lbs now and didn't use it when I was heavier, but I think I would have felt safe using it back when I was at 255.  It feels sturdier than my nylon hammock and that has held 250+lbs.    I do believe I had read that there is a potential for rust with these stands if water gets inside of the pipes, but I haven't used mine outdoors."

Hammocks,34sg0a,Fenrjsulfr,1 point,Mon May 4 06:50:31 2015 UTC,"The pipes are coated on the outside, but not on the inside or in the linkages.  Maybe some sort of tape to prevent water getting into the linkages and unused bolt holes would work, as long as temperature and humidity do not cause condensation to build up inside.  It also can be dis/assembled fairly quickly if you know you'll have rain for an extended time.    Again I haven't used it outside, perhaps someone else will have some outdoor use experience to share.  There may be better options for buying or constructing a stand.  Ideally, I would set posts for a more permanent setup, though I don't have experience with posts outside of fence building, so I'm not sure how the lateral forces affect the thickness or depth required."

It allows you to always hang at the same angle every time you setup your hammock; there's no guess work. You can hang from points that are much further apart and still have your hammock sag. If you're camping it acts as a place to hang a bugnet. It allows for gear storage, or if you're just lounging in the backyard a place to hang a bag that holds a drink.

Hammocks,34fq1p,vibeoffme,7,Thu Apr 30 19:36:40 2015 UTC,"First of all, attach your rope to the shackle with a Lark's Head.   To make a Lark's Head, put the rope through the shackle, then loop it around the outside of the shackle, back down on itself.  This will spread the tension on this connection over two cords (actually 4 cords supporting the connection - two on each side) instead of focusing it on a single point where the cord goes through the shackle.    I would then put the shackle through the loop under the knot (this makes another Lark's Head ). That way, you have two cords supporting your load all the way around and the tension on the cords will pull the knot tighter. This will also reduce the load on the knot, which is the weakest point of your cord.   You can use Whoopie Slings with this - just attach them to the shackle and you will be able to adjust the height of each side."

He has the full setup in drop down boxes along with new continuous loops which are smaller and lighter along with it too. You don't need the dutch clip, you can just run the tree strap through the loop on the end. Also, buy a Structural Ridgeline. Dutch sells and adjustable whoopie SRL that I'd recommended for every hammock. What this does is it locks your hammock into place and no matter how you hang it, you will always have that 30 degree sag. You just loop it through each continuous loop(the loops hanging off each end of the hammock and it prevents the hammock from stretching past a certain distance. Off the top of my head I think mine is 94-95"" but don't quote me on that.

Another option is polycryo, or maybe it's called polycro. It's the plastic sheeting people use to seal off their windows in the winter. I've heard good things about both with regards to coverage and ease of assembly/manufacturing, but the tests are usually a single night. Durability might still be anyone's guess. Wrap a few feet of duck tape around a water bottle for field repairs. The ones I've seen used two washers on either side of the tarp rather than actual grommets, and duck tape reinforcements. I kinda want to make one now, just for fun."

You can get the same tarp off amazon for 40$ though. This would be your best bet if you are looking for something more legit then a walmart blue tarp. Other then that you are going to be spending more. If you want to spring for the 70$ Kelty Noah 12, it's not that small or light, but its way bigger and you could have doors and all. The kelty noah 12 in its sack is about the size of three YO tarps in their sack next to eachother. They sell them at REI so you could just ""test it for a weekend"" and get your money back.

Hammocks,347rnf,ymir666,1 point,Thu Apr 30 05:52:29 2015 UTC,I don't know. I just know that I've heard dog trainers say that. I saw a study that showed e-collar training and traditional positive reinforcement based training are equally effective.
Hammocks,347rnf,hell_on_wheel,1 point,Thu Apr 30 12:42:29 2015 UTC,"Some dogs, especially when they're younger, are just knuckleheads and are very willful. My now 1 year old Japanese Akita for instance, when he has a mind to do something it's going to get done. As a 3mo puppy he managed to shove himself between fence slats he had no business fitting between to chase my down the block because I was out of site walking my other dog.    Positive reinforcement is great, but once a dog is amped up and fixated you need a way to break their focus and get their attention. An e-collar allows for this at a distance beyond arms length.    /dogtrainingrantoff"

My 3 year old rottweiler mix is a big wimp but very bullheaded when he gets it in his head that he wants to do something. We tried to train him on our invisible fence (that our other dog learned very quickly) and after going through all the recommended training whenever he crossed the line and get shocked he'd just sit down and start completely freaking out. He simply couldn't make the association despite all the dry ""noise only"" runs where he seemed to get it. This is on the lowest shock setting mind you. Back to square one. I really doubt we'll ever be able to get him trained on it now since he shakes just seeing the collar on our other dog. For him I would have my doubts that an e-collar could work for training."

Hammocks,347rnf,bravejango,4,Wed Apr 29 13:32:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to down vote because I don't think being overly negative helps anybody.  However I am going to try to put this in perspective, because people sometimes have trouble understanding things from an animals view point.  First off I have heard stories of people's very friendly, very social dog chasing deer or even livestock here on california and biting the animal eventually.  That is extremely unfair for that animal that your dog could injure and is not your dog's fault it is yours.  Also from your dog's perspective, it could chase the deer and very lost and frightened and possibly killed.  That's not very fair to them.  I assume you care about your dog since you want to enrich their life by hiking with them which is great, but the caveat becomes of you care about your dog, why would you subject them to what could become a scary situation for them?  Also if you care about your dog can you sympathize with other animals that your dog could potentially injure that have no place to go and heal.  They have to continue to survive  at the disadvantage of their injury."

Hammocks,345sej,kirschbag,16,Tue Apr 28 15:05:00 2015 UTC,"I work in higher education, and can tell you that trying to get a policy change pushed through this way is often not successful. From the lens of your facilities/risk management folks, allowing this kind of activity creates an undo burden on the system. Even if they allow it, with restrictions on how it is done, there will be an added layer of enforcement needed to regulate that activity.   Also, if it is sanctioned, and someone breaks a leg, there is the opportunity for lawsuits.   The best chance you have of making this work is to gather student momentum in creating an area where the activity is allowed, and proper equipment is designated for the use.  Rather than gathering votes.. gather money and coordinate with your facilities group to identify an area you can do this stuff (hammock club!). Take some ownership of the issue, and it will get you a long way.  This is the same idea as skate parks, etc.  With a designated area, damage to property is mitigated, and risk of lawsuits can be negated by proper signage and well maintained hanging points.

Hammocks,344q6n,kaishichan,5,Wed Apr 29 16:20:41 2015 UTC,Someone convince me this is a good idea. I have no experience with hammocks but I'm having trouble passing this purchase up because of the price. I don't want to have to buy a bunch of other accessories and end up spending another 30 bucks on this thing. What's the most minimal way of going about this if I do end up getting one?
Hammocks,344q6n,flattenedpossum,3,Tue Apr 28 23:51:08 2015 UTC,I bought 2 of these hammocks a few years ago. I went to the automotive department at Wal-Mart and bought a 4 pack of cam buckles for about $10 and I was set for hanging both hammocks.
Hammocks,344q6n,po_ta_to,1 point,Wed Apr 29 08:00:07 2015 UTC,Did you buy straps for it as well? Or does it come with everything else you need?

He liked it. I prefer to have a double. Also, when not camping and just lounging, not having the bugnet is also a big benefit. When camping, I use my DIY Fronkey style bugnet and it works great. Can't go wrong either way. Just my two cents."
Hammocks,344q6n,brianle37,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:39:28 2015 UTC,I got on the double. I'm in south Florida and was planning on making a separate bug screen anyway.

Hammocks,344gqo,Pixielo,9,Tue Apr 28 14:16:38 2015 UTC,Why should I buy your hammock over any of the other examples on the market?  What differentiates your product?
Hammocks,344gqo,kilowhiskeyoscar,7,Tue Apr 28 06:01:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your question. I spent months building prototypes with the primary goal of making a really comfortable hammock that would be great to sleep in. Along the way I invented removable fabric tensioners that manage loose hammock fabric. The GO! hammock is the first hammock in the world with this system! It's also a great value, it's 11' long X 70"" wide starting at just $65. It's made from 70D nylon with triple stitched seams so it's really durable too."
Hammocks,344gqo,Jrose152,16,Tue Apr 28 06:19:39 2015 UTC,"What makes it better then Dutch's? His 11ft version is only 32$. You mention fabric tensioners but I still am confused about that. I'm pretty sure there is a patent on hammocks coming with structural ridgelines. This is why only one company comes with one and not every hammock. Don't quote me on that, but I'm pretty sure. Also, nylon straps arent ""commonly used with hammocks"". Eno produced the slapstrap and replaced it with the Atlas strap. I'm not a fan of eno at all but that statement about nylon commonly being used is just flat out false."

Hammocks,344gqo,ShooTa666,7,Tue Apr 28 17:22:21 2015 UTC,"Great question! In the past I actually purchased several Dutch hammocks as gifts. They are great as are his other products! The Dutch hammock is 58"" wide, the GO! Hammock is 70"" wide, which makes a huge difference in comfort. It also requires a lot more fabric to build and has a seam, which requires more work to build.  Ridgelines are sold by many companies now. Nylon straps are common, there are still many companies using them still. Check Amazo, just because ENO does not use them does not mean that no one does."
Hammocks,344gqo,Jrose152,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:02:04 2015 UTC,"As someone who spent 8 weeks on the AT in both a Snipe (wilderness logics) and a Blackbird (Warbonnet), your 70"" is overkill.  The snipe at 60"" is ample width for a diagonal lay.  And that flappy piece that happens when I'm in my hammy?  That's a breeze blocker, I actually like it.    Have you considered that your hammock may have too much flappy extra material because you've made it another 10"" wider?"
Hammocks,344gqo,ShooTa666,3,Tue Apr 28 16:49:58 2015 UTC,"As somebody who camps regularly and is 6'4"", my 72"" Dangerbird would beg to differ with your assessment that 70"" is overkill."
Hammocks,344gqo,Jrose152,2,Thu Apr 30 12:40:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for pointing that out! I'm only 6'1"" and even I use the 70"" width completely. I  made several different sizes to determine that 70"" is pretty versatile and comfortable."

Hammocks,344gqo,DreamHammock,2,Sun May 3 16:14:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input and for your opinion. No hammock is prefect for everyone and I'm glad you have hammocks that you like. Both Wildreness Logics and Warbonnet make awesome products!   To determine the width of the GO! Hammock, I made lots of prototypes of various lengths and widths. For me (I'm 6'1"" tall) the 70"" width was much more comfortable than the 60"".  I use all of the fabric while laying at a diagonal angle in the GO! Hammock. I found that the extra width made it easier to sleep through the night and made it easier to find more comfortable positions. I tested my prototypes by sleeping through the night on many occasions. The extra width is also great when 2 people want to relax in the hammock. I also made prototypes that were wider than 70"" but for me, any larger truly was wasted fabric.  If you prefer floppy sides, the fabric tensioners on the GO! hammock are easily removable.  Thanks, Jason"
Hammocks,344gqo,ShooTa666,2,Tue Apr 28 17:07:39 2015 UTC,the ridgeline thing is not correct - i know of 3 examples of SOLD hammocks with structural ridgelines.

Edit: A forum post(who knows how reliable) turned up this statement from someone. ""Hennessy had patented the ridgeline originally, baring anyone else from using that design, until someone found a previous patent for the idea that had expired, which effectively voided Hennessy's patent due to prior art existing. I don't know if it ever went to court, but it's clear Hennessy isn't defending his patent anyway."""

Hammocks,33ruxb,theodopolis13,2,Sat Apr 25 05:42:26 2015 UTC,Part of the trail is too narrow for anything larger than a jeep. Obviously quads could get up it too. Just threw that in there so people didn't think a stock f150 could get there.  Edit: not sure why I'm getting down voted for explaining myself. It not my opinion that a full size truck couldn't get up the trail it's a fact. They just can't physically fit through the trail.
Hammocks,33ruxb,hupo224,2,Sat Apr 25 06:22:33 2015 UTC,Yeah I describe trails as jeep width and full size width myself here in NJ.

Hammocks,33ruxb,Muzzicog,-2,Sat Apr 25 09:40:39 2015 UTC,Again land rover defender is about the same size. A stock one would need at least a winch to get through the first part of the trail as one can easily become high centered. I'm lifted and my skids were scraping in a few spots. Tires would also be an issue. It is very muddy at the bottom of the trail.
Hammocks,33ruxb,darksiderising,2,Sat Apr 25 12:34:08 2015 UTC,"To be honest I was just expressing my ridiculous probably weirdly nationalistic pride in the land rover. I can get my 110 in some very tricky spots and it's stock except for skinny mud tyres - we use it for moving students around and between forestry sites on Dartmoor, which is pretty dire and basically a load of mud even in July...  I think the defender is a fair bit narrower than a Jeep - they are 70 inches - 2 inches wider than an Opel Corsa, which is a common compact/supermini. You can tell inside. Considering there are a lot of roads here which are barely 100 inches wide, it's a godsend to have a 4wd as small as the def."
Hammocks,33ruxb,Muzzicog,0,Sat Apr 25 14:02:07 2015 UTC,"Ah okay. I was worried you were going to try starting an Offroad argument about what's best. Seen it happen far too often. I don't doubt a stock defender with mud tires is really capable. The jeep tj and defender are very similar in terms of mechanics. both have a front engine, 4x4 tcase, and solid axles which makes them very similar for Offroad use. If I could get a defender for a reasonable cost I would totally have one if I didn't have my jeep.   Just looked up dimensions. A stock tj width is actually 66.7"". I was even kinda surprised. I know mine would probably be sitting closer to 70"" as I've got wider tires than stock as mine stick out further than the body. I'm sure the newer jk is much wider than a defender as they got much larger when they changed over the body styling."

Hammocks,33ruxb,stilljustkeyrock,2,Mon Apr 27 09:08:50 2015 UTC,A stock F-150 can hardly go on paved roads.
Hammocks,33ruxb,miasmic,1 point,Sat Apr 25 14:28:11 2015 UTC,"Jeep wrangler, 73.7 inches.  F150, 79.9.  The trail is always wider than you think.  6.2 inches doesn't make a difference.  Post the GPS link if you are so confident.  What trail is it?"
Hammocks,33ruxb,darksiderising,1 point,Mon Apr 27 03:07:13 2015 UTC,"What year wrangler did you search up? 2007+ is considerably wider than 2006 and down. Also look at how much longer an f150 is. With enough back and forth you might get one through the narrow spots (with body damage), clearance would also be a huge issue, and stock tires would struggle in the mud at the base. After you get past the narrow muddy portion of the trail it's mostly a rocky switch back trail to the top. I'd be surprised to see a stock pickup get through the base area of the trail with no body damage and with no help of winch or another rig to pull.  Edit: here's some dimensions.   Jeep tj (what I drive)  Overall length = 155.4""  Overall width = 66.7""   Ford f150 2010, 4x4, 6.5' box (shortest)   Overall length 213.1""  Overall width 79"" (excluding mirrors)  So if we include the mirrors even if they're folded in the base of them will stick out a couple inches either side. And then if we add 2"" either side to my tj as I've got wider tires than I'll be sitting right around 70"". That's approximately 13"" difference in width. Just over a foot difference. That seems pretty big to me. Then the truck itself is almost 5' longer than my tj."
Hammocks,33ruxb,BlackestStormy,1 point,Mon Apr 27 03:20:20 2015 UTC,"So why not just say what trail you were on?  What mountain did you top?  I love in Colorado and the number of Jeep drivers that think trails are Jeep only is rather tiresome.  If a H1 Hummer can do Blackbear Pass there are very few ""Jeep only"" trails.  Trails seem narrower that they are."
Hammocks,33ruxb,squeaki,1 point,Mon Apr 27 04:06:05 2015 UTC,"Baseline. Don't know what the mountain is. I didn't mean only a jeep could get up it. I just didn't want people to think the average 4x4 on the road would be able to get up the trail. The bypass around the muddy base area weaves through the trees and if my tj is scraping on tree trunks than I highly doubt a pickup truck would fit. I've got a dent on my tailgate to prove that.   If one had a lifted rig on at least 33"" mudterrains then they should be able to get through the muddy part but still would have trouble getting around the corners there depending on size. About half way there is a small rock ledge that can be tricky if you've got open diffs. I can get through the muddy area but I end up scraping my skids on most of it and I'm lifted on 33s."

Hammocks,33jhmk,ShooTa666,1 point,Fri Apr 24 17:20:22 2015 UTC,depends on the shape of the tarp.  usually though you want greater than 6 inches of tarp covering the ends of your suspensionwhen the hammock is not weighted (your not in it)    square tarps/rectangle ones can be pitched either in diamond or normal configuration.    cat cut/hex tarps usually have to be hung along the centerline of the design -  this is becuase usually the center tieout points are reinforced more than other edge ones.    diamond tarps - can really only be used in that format - hennesy ones for example/

Hammocks,33b6fw,mrjowee,6,Tue Apr 21 15:38:50 2015 UTC,I walked around a while looking for a pair of stable enough points that were close enough together. I had almost set up my hang between two rows of terminal chairs that were bolted down before I found these giant steel stanchions that were about 15' apart.   Before setting up I gave them a few good leans to gauge sway/deflection before setting up my atlas straps and ENO. Gave it a final test by gingerly sitting on the hammock and it felt very solid. A few bounces with no sway and I was comfortable putting my weight fully on it.

Hammocks,335ggz,Kawihal,-5,Mon Apr 20 17:39:17 2015 UTC,"With the ENO, you know what you're getting; a tiny hammock that weighs a ton and costs too much. With the Fox (never heard of it) I'd question the size. It's listed as 10.5 feet long, but I'm doubting that. I'd expect it's 9', or even 8.5, since that seems to be the default length of all of the Chinese Amazon ""parachute nylon"" hammocks. Also, it comes with ropes for suspension. Hanging a hammock by ropes is what causes hammocks to be banned from parks and public property.   Buy a hammock and suspension from DutchwareGear.com instead. Made in the US by a cottage vendor, their hammocks are a much better quality and still affordable. $35 for the hammock body, and $22 for a cinch buckle suspension (add another $18 for the titanium hooks if you want them)."

Hammocks,333a3p,redneckgymrat,3,Sun Apr 19 02:46:46 2015 UTC,If you use a structural ridgeline at 83%(general rule of thumb) then you will have a consistent and exact sag every single time you hang it no matter how your suspension is hung. I highly suggest in one. It basically locks your sag in. I suggest Dutch's whoopie sling adjustable.
Hammocks,333a3p,Jrose152,2,Sun Apr 19 05:25:15 2015 UTC,I wouldn't own a hammock without one.

Hammocks,333a3p,SirWill,2,Thu Apr 23 07:24:23 2015 UTC,"Sure, its super simple. there are loops on each end and you slide your continious loop(the loop coming out of each end of the hammock) through them. Now you have a line running from feet to head on the hammock. This will make sure the hammock can't stretch past a certain point. In my opinion, every hammock should have one, but a company managed to get a patent on SRL's so only one company can sell them with the hammock. Here is and example. Now no matter how you hang your suspension, you will always have that 30 degree sag everytime. No more having to figure it out each time you set up. Another example."

Hammocks,333a3p,Jrose152,2,Wed May 13 19:52:20 2015 UTC,"Fair enough! I have a couple of whoopie slings already made up, so I will try this the next time I can get out in the back yard without my kids already hogging up all the trees. :7) And then it should be easy to make another one of nearly the right length, and then tag it with tape or something."
Hammocks,333a3p,wenestvedt,3,Wed May 13 20:13:59 2015 UTC,"Your angle and sag are extremely important. I see pictures on this sub all the time of people who hang their hammocks at tightly as possible, and it makes you bend like a banana while the hammock sides ride up like a pea pod.   A proper hang lets you get almost totally flat with a diagonal lay. I've got mine dialed in where I can comfortably lay on my side."

There IS a sweet spot, though there are also many which are merely good.  I'm still dialing it in.  Sleeping in the sun is almost impossible, even when you're exhausted.  Or, at least it is for me.  I relaxed, but never got to sleep.  Wind makes the hammock sway...pleasant, but not when the sides are whipping around your face.  I can't lay on my bed without pain.  I just spent over an hour in a hammock and my back pain is, essentially, gone.  Nonexistent, now, but probably not healed long term.  Yet."

I shit you not, hammock camping, in the eyes of Parks Victoria, is one of the singularly most dangerous and environmentally damaging activities you could engage in within the state forests, bushland and parks.   I made a follow up call and was told that it was simply not worth discussing. It is not permitted and that is all. I was not even given time to explain that, much of the time in the alpine regions, it's easier to hang a hammock over all the rubbish left by other campers than pitch IN it...... Sour grapes, I guess. The style of camping does not cause damage, more the style of the camper, I've always found.

Now I'm sure that wasn't the attitude of everyone but it does agitate me a little if it was even brought up because some people didn't want hammocks hung up across the street from their houses (in a place where people often wall their dogs and picnic and play Frisbee and so on).   /end rant"

Its unfortunate that a benign activity such as hammocks has fallen under scrutiny, but its probably due to damage from people attempting to hang from trees/branches that can't support the weight.  Once a branch is broken, its broken.  You can't glue it back together."

We quickly made it above the snow line and found the camp site under a foot and a half of snow. It was my wife's first time ever sleeping in a hammock, and my second. It was a pretty wild experience and I would love to do it again with the right gear. Here's what we used:  Hammocks: Grand Trunk Ultralight Suspension: 15' of 1"" webbing and two descender rings for each side (GT s-hooks right onto the descender ring. Worked like a charm) Tarp: A way-too-small silnylon tarp borrowed from my dad. Thanks, pop! Insulation: A Hotcore T-300 for me and a Hotcore Roma-300 for my wife in pea-pod style. We sewed openings in the foot box and hood and cinched everything up tight, but there was still an air gap between the hammock and the bottom of the bag. I think this setup would be good to about freezing, but it was a bit too cold for comfort at -10.  All in all, it was a great first ever trip and I can't wait to try this again in some warmer weather!"

Hammocks,32wb55,lbrol,7,Fri Apr 17 14:46:58 2015 UTC,Thanks! We had an old double-wide sleeping bag that we cut shorter that he loves to curl up in. We used a yoga mat for ground insulation and he slept in the tent with my sister-in-law. He was really resourceful about the snow though! While we were at camp he kept moving to keep warm and would find trees with bare ground at the base and dig until he got to warmer soil and then curl up for a nap.

Hammocks,32rb4s,stefprez,2,Thu Apr 16 18:51:04 2015 UTC,"Our first backpacking hang was much like /u/whabt describes in his comment below. We used three trees, with our heads both at the single point, and our feet off at two different, but relatively close, angles.  Back then we were using an 8x10 silver/brown tarp, and made it work.  We ended up using a very long ridgeline to support the center of the tarp, but it was a decent hang.  We learned a lot that trip in regards to creative rigging. ;)  The only thing I didn't like about that particular trip, though, is if we had really NEEDED the tarp for rain shelter, it may not have sufficed the way we had everything pitched. The tarp was almost just a big flat surface with a small crease in the middle.  I like the Noah much better in that it's much easier to do the a-frame."
Hammocks,32rb4s,mrjowee,2,Thu Apr 16 15:09:02 2015 UTC,"We use a 12x12 Noah. You're right, you need a very big tarp if it's raining."

Hammocks,32rb4s,LucentBirch,2,Thu Apr 16 13:39:17 2015 UTC,"Totally correct.  If it's crazy windy, we can pitch it down a bit tighter, which offers me even more coverage at the bottom. Still, the thing is so large, it's never been an issue so far.  Plus, if the rain is coming down sideways, I will close the ends of the tarp as well."

Hammocks,32p7tc,xtemplarx,3,Wed Apr 15 17:31:25 2015 UTC,Hammock camping can be very frugal if you piece everything together rather than buying a complete system. $200 for a complete shelter that's under 2lbs.
Hammocks,32p7tc,kyleisthestig,2,Wed Apr 15 17:41:03 2015 UTC,"True this.  In this vein, the hammock that I use when backpacking/camping is the Grand Trunk Skeeter Beeter Pro (~$75.00), which has the bug net built in.  This, plus atlas straps (~$25) and my insanely-large-but-I-love-the-space-so-I-don't-mind-the-extra-weight Kelty Noah 12 tarp (~$70.00), and I have a good little setup for around $170 total.   Plus, my wife's hammock fits under the same tarp, so no need for duplication of gear in that regard. :D  Edit: maths"

Hammocks,32p7tc,mrjowee,1 point,Thu Apr 16 02:20:47 2015 UTC,"$200 for a shelter, not a complete sleep system. If you're on the ground you'll need a sleeping bag (or quilt) and an inflatable pad. A Thermarest xlite is $130, and the xterm is over $200. Price wise that's about equal to what you would need in an underquilt in the same temp ranges. Of course in the summer, in a hammock, you might not need anything at all."

Hammocks,32higa,aussum_possum,2,Mon Apr 13 21:08:12 2015 UTC,"I've never used either, but I know they serve the same purpose. I think the UCR (utility constrictor ridgeline?) just places the slack at the foot end of the line rather than in the center like a whoopie sling rl.

Hammocks,32higa,mrjowee,1 point,Mon Apr 13 22:30:44 2015 UTC,"both are adjustable ridgelines... therefore both equally good - it comes down to preference. the whoopie will be heavier but only just..    whoopies and and UCRs (universal constrictor rope) function very similarly, the difference being you need some sort knot or other method to keep tension on one end of the UCR bury, but that's easily remedied with a prussic knot.   83% is a good starting place for your ridgeline length (weight/height will play a role in any changes to this magic %)    did you watch dutches video? https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=aaR2cWfw1po    i personally have a fixed ridgline - but if i had to choose i would go with the whoopies due to being more used to them.    your bugnet would certainly go above/around your hammock and the ridgeline would keep it off your face.     your tarp should be on a separate suspension from your hammock so should be above any hammock ridgeline.    i advise you watch shug emerys beginner videos ---> https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB8752777861C2AA8"

I recommend getting an adjustable one at first, but once you get it dialed in, most people find they don't change it, so a fixed ridgeline makes more sense in the long run. If you're willing to try, a whoopie sling style ridgeline can be turned into a fixed ridgeline, just bury the adjustable tail end into the body and it locks in place when put under tension."

You're going to bend those antenna and possibly break them like that.

Arrowhead equipment ultra light clinch buckles with homemade 1 inch tree strap webbing. Tarp is a kelty noah 12 modded with velcro on the ends so i can close the ends to keep snow and wind out. Also homemade snake skins for the tarp. Tarp is attached to the trees with dutchware stingers with 1.75 zing it. I dont use a tarp ridgeline. Homemade down underquilt i have taken down to negitive temps with no problems. The sleeping bag is a walmart down bag that i added another pound of 700 fill down to so its like a sauna. I keep my jacket around my feet end because the quilt is 3/4 length. I use a cheap inflatable pillow that i got off dx.com. I use a cheap 88 liter backpack i got as a gift years ago and its suprising lasted 4 years with constant use and no serious wear. This is my cold weather setup, I was expecting freezing temps but it turned out to be like 55"
Hammocks,32crt4,Jrose152,2,Sun Apr 12 19:09:27 2015 UTC,I just bought the Kelty Noah 12 like 2 weeks ago and the the woot rainfly went on sale and I grabbed one. I've yet to set up either but I think I am going to return the Kelty Noah since it's so much bigger when folded up then the Woot Rainfly. It looks like such a spacious tarp but It's just too large for me folded up compared to the YO tarp. I wish the YO rainfly never went on sale so I could justify keeping it.
Hammocks,32crt4,Jrose152,4,Sun Apr 12 22:30:54 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/CYZU2mS this is the YO under a skeeter beeter. Its a diamond shape not a square so the coverage from wind on your face while you sleep is not very good. Im sure it will be fine in a pinch but i wouldnt want to get stuck with this thing in a storm for very long. That said i too got a YO for 20 buck last week and intend on using it this summer for good weather backpacking, but if there is any chance of rain ill bring a bigger tarp"
Hammocks,32crt4,mrjowee,2,Sun Apr 12 22:55:38 2015 UTC,you might want to keep the kelty. I too have the YO tarp and it isnt very wide. It will be good for great weather but if you are ever in a rainstorm you might get wet. Also the YO doesnt do a good job of blocking wind. ill upload a photo of the YO set up hold on
Hammocks,32crt4,davidrools,2,Sun Apr 12 22:54:06 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I can only afford one financially and I plan camping around bad weather because I can't really hike anymore due to an ankle I destroyed 3 years ago in a motorcycle accident. Me owning a tarp is really just a backup in case it decides to rain but I won't be planning any trips when rain is expected. I just needed something as a just in case for music festivals and small camping trips. I'm still stuck in my decision on if I want to keep it or not. I know it is a lot better of a tarp but for my situation I'm not sure it's needed. Plus worse case I'll always be with someone who has a tent if it gets too bad. Worst part is, I used the 20% off discount from REI so my Kelty was only like 52$ instead of the original 70$."

Tree straps are 1"" polypro webbing, secured to hammock and tarp lines with marlin spikes around found stick toggles.  About 40 degrees last night, and rain came steadily til morning, but the inside of the tarp stayed gloriously dry (love that ventilation!), and hammock was comfily warm with a 1/2"" closed-cell foam pad below and a mostly-unzipped 40-degree bag on top (plus two layers of pants and fleece jacket).  tl;dr: Made hammock; used it; loved it!"

Hammocks,329n8h,mrjowee,2,Sun Apr 12 00:53:04 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't have to do anything to seal a tarp from leaking. Adding seam seal to the sewn seams doesn't hurt, but this should be done by the manufacturer. Tarps are made of silicone impregnated nylon, which is water proof by nature (to an extent). If it rains steadily for hours on end (like an entire day) a silnylon tarp can leak no matter how well it's sealed. With a tarp or double wall tent the small amount of water that does make it through will usually roll down the walls of the tarp and drip onto the ground.   This is why I giggle when people recommend a single wall enclosed shelter. Enjoy your puddle."

Hammocks,32ac6h,ChroniclyDope,4,Sun Apr 12 00:53:12 2015 UTC,"I'd be less worried about the damage and mire worried that it would be warm enough. Even a purpose built quilt can be cold if it isn't adjusted right. One way to do it that wouldn't damage the hammock would be to sew some loops to the corners of the bag (better still some along the length as well) and use shock chords to the ends of the hammock. This will give you some adjustment opportunities, (some chord locks would help here). Use the clips to bunch up the ends to keep it snug. If its a rectangular bag google 'poncho liner under quilt' (PLUQ) to see some ways you could use it.    Bring a roll mat as a backup."
Hammocks,32ac6h,punkfunkymonkey,1 point,Sun Apr 12 02:38:18 2015 UTC,That's brilliant. I'm thinking the clips won't hurt the hammock unless they have sharp edges. Love the shock cord idea.

Second, I'm going on a scouting trip next weekend for next months turkey hunt and its scheduled to dip down just below freezing.

Its the same shape as a top quilt and provides a good stopgap until you can get a quilt set. for instance a Military Sleep System Patrol bag is what I use for a TC. You can also make a PLUQ(sewn or not sewn)."
Hammocks,32ac6h,3Frog,1 point,Mon Apr 13 13:55:25 2015 UTC,Seems to me like the under quilt would either take all of the weight when someone lies or none of the weight and be too far away from the user (depending on if the quilt suspension is too short or too long). You really need to suspend it with shock cord.

Hammocks,32acgp,Jrose152,1 point,Sun Apr 12 17:49:17 2015 UTC,"Haven't gotten to ridgelines yet, so I couldn't really tell you. Check out hammockforums.net, specifically the section dealing with suspension systems and rigelines. The point of a ridgeline is to maintain a specific distance between the ends so the hammock always lays the same no matter how the straps are adjusted. The tricky part is doing the trial and error of figuring out that perfect length and that's where the adjustable ridgeline comes in handy. Once you get it figured out though, you can make a permanent ridgeline with a few dollars worth of Amsteel.  I'm glad it's worked out for you!"

The only knot you need to know for a whoopie is a marlinespike hitch which sounds way more difficult than it actually is.

It ends up being close to the same price as buying all those things separately via REI, but you get far better quality.  http://www.rei.com/b/hennessy-hammock?ir=brand%3Ahennessy-hammock&pagesize=90&r=b&page=1"
Hammocks,324ydw,RoboNinjaPirate,5,Sat Apr 11 01:39:38 2015 UTC,"I went from a double to only laying in 60"" wide hammocks and I took a minute to get used to. Haven't touched my doublenest in forever. You can cash that dividend in for cold hard cash and make your $$ go a lot farther."
Hammocks,324ydw,swampwalker906,1 point,Fri Apr 10 17:15:56 2015 UTC,"The Byers I have is 54"".  Usually when I wake up in it I am curled on my side in the fetal position unless its like mid summer and its hot.  I slept fine in it, but when stretching in a diagonal lay my hands and feet go off the edge and its kind of uncomfortable. The Byer that I have has a sort of ""fringe"" in the material by the connection points:  http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/718QSUETlBL._SL1500_.jpg  And I don't really like the suspension system.  It's kind of a hassle, and does not use straps, so it's not good for trees.  Where I camp though there is a 3 sided Adirondack shelter, so I just hang from the rafters. I think I may use the dividend to upgrade my suspension system rather than the hammock right now."
Hammocks,324ydw,fromkentucky,0,Fri Apr 10 21:13:17 2015 UTC,"It's not the measured width that matters as much as the overall cut and hang.   My 11ft Dutchware NylonD is only 58"" wide but I can lay in it diagonally just fine because it's specifically cut for it. I would guess your Byers is cut for straight head-to-toe laying."
Hammocks,324ydw,meshmeld,2,Sat Apr 11 02:44:41 2015 UTC,"Oh its definitely meant for a diagonally hang, the package even has a little DO/DO NOT for diagonal/head-to-toe.  I'm a side sleeper in bed.  I slept in my Byer's damn near nightly for 2 years indoors instead of a bed and used it on dozens of camping trips.  Its honestly not TOO bad, I just kind of wanted a way to justify getting a new toy, and for free at that haha  I ended up getting webbing, some descending rings, and climbing carabiners and rigged up a new suspension system. specifically the one shown in this video using the rings:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1f2Xts3Spsc  REI doesn't carry amsteel blue so i just spent a couple bucks on a few feet of thinner climbing rated cord (the employee looked up the weight rating and said I'd be more than fine) for the loops running through the hammock ""channel"" (the byers is fringed on the end and has a channel on each of the 5 fringes).  I'll get some Amsteel in the future, but I'm planning on going camping tomorrow.. and didn't have enough rope to use the Byers MicroRope toggle cuz i cut to much fucking around with it after my last trip a few weeks ago haha Ok im done, sorry for the ramble. have a few in me"

And even adjusting could be a PITA at night and maybe a bit intoxicated haha.  Not to mention the original rope started failing after using it on some eye hook type bolts indoors.  So ive already had to replace that with thicker climbing cord that hasnt shown any wear for about a year, but is too thick for the set up in the video.  also its heavy  REI doesn't carry amsteel blue so i just spent a couple bucks on a few feet of thinner climbing rated cord (the employee looked up the weight rating and said I'd be more than fine) for the loops running through the hammock ""channel"" (the byers is fringed on the end and has a channel on each of the 5 fringes).

I had purposely placed the anchor points close together so that I could use the hammock as a chair with a back.

Hammocks,31wasj,Azrolicious,-3,Wed Apr 8 23:59:01 2015 UTC,"I have friends that use their ENO for casual relaxing and I'm not against that but there are far better, lighter and less expensive options that are handmade in the USA by small cottage vendors and not mass produced in China. I'm half joking when I troll ENO but it seems like there's a level of stupidity and ignorance I notice when I see posts like this one. Stacking, hanging in bad locations like across sidewalks or on stairways, using ropes on trees. Things like that give hammocking a bad name and it's just a matter of time before responsible hangers are no longer allowed to hang in state or national parks because of it. Just like skateboarding, when assholes become the norm it gets outlawed or banned."

Hammocks,31wasj,McBlaster,3,Thu Apr 9 02:52:45 2015 UTC,What kind of hammock are you speaking of. My cheepo Amazon hammock finally tore. I was thinking about getting a eno double nest. What brand of hammock is that size or bigger and around the same price point?
Hammocks,31wasj,RoboIcarus,-1,Thu Apr 9 03:04:55 2015 UTC,"Start with dutchwaregear.com, I believe his hammocks start around $30 with no straps or whoopie slings, he has several options for suspension and you may already have straps that you can use. Are you looking for long term use camping and actually sleeping for days at a time in it or just short term relaxing and napping? Personally I have over $700 invested in my rig but that includes expensive custom made down top quilts, a 12' sil-nylon tarp with doors, bottom quilt, titanium dutch accessories, etc. I bought everything to last me a lifetime and sold my rei tents and self inflating pads to supplement the cost. I also spread that cost out over a year. Im in no way saying spend what I did but when you get serious about it you become a little obsessed. I looked at your history and saw you vape. Its like that, you can get a cheapo for $10 or 20 or spend as much as you want well into the hundreds.  Down voted for solid advice, ENO fan boys sure show thier ignorance/stupidity."

Hammocks,31wasj,McBlaster,5,Thu Apr 9 02:31:31 2015 UTC,"I can see why you are being down voted on some of your posts. They are negative and not helpful. You do have some great information though in one of your posts below.  I still don't quite understand why other options are better (do you mean just build quality and durability) but I can understand the price and the local made aspect.  I totally understand your worry about irresponsible hangers being bad for our hobby. Consider this though, ENO is probably the most common brand out there due to its availability and marketing. Its essentially the gateway hammock. How useful is it for our hobby to come to a community forum and see people posting egotistical or snobbish remarks about arguably the most common camping hammock available?"
Hammocks,31wasj,aussum_possum,1 point,Thu Apr 9 02:54:15 2015 UTC,"I don't mind the down votes because fake internet popularity points don't really mean much to me and I've got thousands to spare. I like riling up my friends at times in good fun and it's so much easier to rile up ENO apologists on here. Actually most of my posts are very helpful with exception to my dissing of ENO.  Other options are better for several reasons mainly buying a handmade piece of gear in a variety of lengths, materials, colors and other options like single or double layer, head and foot boxes, gathered end or bridge, etc. Any of the small made in the USA companies can be called and the owner who actually makes the gear answers and will answer all your questions, that simply isn't true with ENO.   While ENO may be currently the most marketed hammock and unfortunately the most popular on reddit, this forum is absolutely not the community forum one should be basing their research on. Go to hammockforums.net and youll find out that the consensus is that they are shorter, heavier, overpriced, not a good value, use deceptive advertising and they have no presence on HF because they're not marketing to people who research hammocks. They're preying on people who know absolutely nothing about hammocks. In fact many ENO owners there would tell you that if they could do it all over again they would not go with ENO, but I guess they don't know what they're talking about.  I sure didn't use reddit as my source for research and neither should anyone else and that's why I didn't waste my money on an entry level hammock only to rebuy everything again a year later. This forum is mostly an ENO circle jerk featuring most of the negative aspects I stated in my other posts on this thread. r/hammockcamping is slightly better as they don't want pics of peoples feet and zero detail of someone's hammock rig. What demographic provides the most foot selfies? Call it tough love or being an asshole I don't really care but what I do care about is responsible hanging and buying better gear from homegrown small businesses that are run by serious hammock campers for serious hammock campers or even casual hangers. Spend your money however you want but know there are better options, better value and small companies with integrity willing to go above and beyond your customer service expectations.    I welcome any discussion that can change my view on this and hopefully I've changed someone else's view."

Hammocks,31ymjt,Jrose152,2,Sun Apr 12 07:35:27 2015 UTC,"I noticed you were down voted for asking this question twice yet no one had the sense to answer you.  I would suggest that less knee hyperextension would be achieved by a longer hammock not necessarily the material. If you're using a short popular hammock that is worshipped on this forum, ENO,  and you're a taller person I would suggest an 11 foot long hammock to get a superior symmetrical lay, making you lay as flat as possible. Something that cannot really be achieved in a hammock that is only 9' 4"" long. The longer the hammock the less calf pressure and definitely no hanging like a banana."

Ive layed in both and the difference is noticeable, though not by a great deal (you don't sink two feet, but you do sag more).

For experimentation you can whip the hammock ends so you can cut down on sewing.

Hang in your basement or something for a few hours, take a nap and see how it feels... then try making it a foot shorter, see what the difference is.

Hammocks,31wpvf,fromkentucky,2,Thu Apr 9 13:12:38 2015 UTC,I have an 11ft Dutchware NylonD that is very comfortable and light. The material just feels nicer than the ENO and Yukon hammocks I've tried. A 10 footer should be fine for someone your size and it would cost a little over $70 WITH a complete suspension system.
Hammocks,31wpvf,aussum_possum,2,Thu Apr 9 13:07:28 2015 UTC,This times a billion.  It's even cheaper if you do some simple DIY for the suspension (new sewing required).
Hammocks,31wpvf,fromkentucky,3,Fri Apr 10 19:08:09 2015 UTC,"Indeed. A $6 pair of Cinch Buckles on 15"" Amsteel Continuous Loops and an $8.80 pair of 10ft Polyester Tree Straps is all you really need.   Just wrap the Tree Strap around the tree and pull the tail through the loop, like this, then thread the tail into the Cinch Buckle like so and pull tight."
Hammocks,31wpvf,reggae_muffin,2,Fri Apr 10 20:26:26 2015 UTC,"This is what I am considering doing, as you suggested on my post the other day. Do whoopie slings have any advantages over this setup?"
Hammocks,31wpvf,reggae_muffin,1 point,Sun Apr 12 01:25:59 2015 UTC,"They're quite a bit lighter. I haven't used them, so I can't say much about them other than people who try Whoopie Slings seem to stick with them.  I think a pair of 15ft Polyester Tree Straps, Cinch Buckles and Continuous Loops weigh about a quarter pound, while 5ft Tree Huggers, Whoopie Slings and 2 aluminum toggles weigh about half that."
Hammocks,31wpvf,hangingfrog,1 point,Sun Apr 12 02:33:47 2015 UTC,Unless you were truly interested in making your own (which I don't know so much about) you can definitely get a good hammock set up for less than $200.

Check out www.dutchwaregear.com and you can actually put money into the pocket of someone who is loved among the hammock community for a reason. He's a good dude who cares about us. You should get your suspension from him anyway under the whoopie hook suspension. He also sells a cheap(price) 11ft hammock. You could have a quality hammock, with really good light suspension, tree straps, continuous loops, and a structural ridge line for the price of an eno hammock. As far as hammock length, generally anything under 10ft long is advised against. You actually just missed the woot sale which was yesterday where you could get the Yukon outfitters double wide hammock for 20$ and the rain tarp for 20$. I sleep in one every night and have two backups. Another extra YO double, a YO single bug net version, and a grand trunk ultra light. But yeah seriously, check out Dutch. Its better to put your money in someone's pocket then the register of a company that charges 3x the amount of what they should."

Hammocks,31tx76,HeyRememberThatTime,1 point,Wed Apr 8 13:07:54 2015 UTC,Hella versatile setup.
Hammocks,31tx76,fromkentucky,2,Sat Apr 11 01:46:05 2015 UTC,"I'll throw one more option into the mix:  http://www.warbonnetoutdoors.com/webbing-buckles-suspension/  I've got the AHE whoopie kit on one of my hammocks, and it's solid. I've got another with that Warbonnet kit, and another with Dutch's whoopie hooks. All good and much lighter than anything you'll buy from a major retailer for the same money or more."
Hammocks,31tx76,fromkentucky,2,Wed Apr 8 14:21:16 2015 UTC,"I haven't used whoopie slings but I would like to try them and I've heard great things about AHE's Marlin Spike Whoopie Kit.   I have however used Cinch buckles and highly recommend them.  If you're considering Cinch Buckles, I'd recommend pairing some 10-12ft Dutchware Polyester Tree Straps with a pair of Cinch Buckles on 15"" Continuous Loops. Just thread the Continuous Loops through the end channels of your hammock then pull the cinch buckle back through the loop like this, and pull tight.  I've done this on several hammocks, it works well and removes a lot of unnecessary bulk and weight by eliminating the factory rope and steel hooks."
Hammocks,31tx76,Jrose152,2,Thu Apr 9 18:42:07 2015 UTC,And that will be all I need? If so I think I'll get these. Do the tree straps need to be that long? I probably won't be using very large trees.
Hammocks,31tx76,HeyRememberThatTime,2,Thu Apr 9 23:58:42 2015 UTC,"That's all you'll need. Just wrap the Tree Strap around the tree and pull the tail through the loop, like this, then thread the tail into the Cinch Buckle like so and pull tight.   I like to use Black Diamond Carabiners on the loops of my Tree Strap to save the time of pulling the tail through and then back again when I take it down, but it's not necessary.   80% of the time, you won't use more than 6ft of your Straps, but every now and again it's nice to have the extra length, not just for trees spaced more than 20' apart, but also in case you hang on a hill and one tree is significantly lower than the other; just hang really close to the lower tree and use the full length of the other strap to reach the upper tree."
Hammocks,31tx76,Jrose152,2,Fri Apr 10 00:27:34 2015 UTC,"Okay, thanks! I think this is what I'll go with."

Hammocks,31tx76,ShooTa666,2,Wed Apr 8 07:23:20 2015 UTC,"I looked at that, but it's a bit out of my price range. Why are whoopie slings $15 each on that website but $18 for a pair on the whoopie slings website?"
Hammocks,31tx76,ShooTa666,2,Wed Apr 8 12:53:23 2015 UTC,"Dutch sells plain whoopies for $7 each. What you're looking at there are whoopies with his titanium whoopie hook spliced on. In that setup you'd connect continuous loops to your hammock ends, and then use the hooks to connect the whoopies to the hammock. By no means necessary, but it allows you to pack your complete suspension apart from the hammock body, which can be nice in the rain."

They are a bit heavy for my taste for actual backpacking, but the size and stretch of these is great for stringing up on a sunny day at the park."
Hammocks,31qem0,kurteous,2,Tue Apr 7 15:07:45 2015 UTC,"New to hammocks, just bought the double. Is it necessary to swap out the rope and how would I go about doing it?

Hammocks,31qem0,thatonedudeyeah,2,Wed Apr 8 04:31:17 2015 UTC,"Me personally, I'd suggest getting your suspension from Dutwaregear. Here is the whoopie hook suspension which allows you to select your tree huggers, continuous loops, and whoopie slings. You don't need a dutch clip. Get a whoopie sling adjustable ridgeline here. The continuous loops, aka ""the rope"" you are talking about is not necessary, but you can swap them out as most due to save weight. It's as simple as untying the knot and then slipping through the new continuous loop."
Hammocks,31qem0,Jrose152,2,Wed Apr 8 07:25:20 2015 UTC,"I've definitely been looking at this as I see a lot of it on the sub. As a guy who's not going to be worried about weight or anything and I'm just looking for something dead simple to use and at a decent price, would the atlas win out then over the whoopie sling route? I'm sure once I do it a few times it'd be easy, but it also costs almost 20 more than the atlas straps and seems to have the same performance with the only benefit being weight reduction"
Hammocks,31qem0,thatonedudeyeah,3,Wed Apr 8 12:09:33 2015 UTC,"Smaller, lighter, you can fit your suspension and hammock all into one small stuff sack, you aren't stuck to adjusting to their predetermined loops so you can have finer adjustments, and you would be supporting a down to earth guy who is very active and helpful to the hammock community rather then giving your money to a cooperation that overcharges for all their products. I'd rather put money in someones pocket than a register whenever available. The atlas straps would work, but you won't ever see me giving ENO a dime."
Hammocks,31qem0,Jrose152,3,Wed Apr 8 18:11:00 2015 UTC,"Actually, you convinced me after I spent the afternoon watching videos online trying to figure out all the whoopie sling stuff, and I ended up placing an order with dutch. 2 whoopie slings that I'll use through the tunnel end of the hammock to just replace the factory suspension thing, as well as 2 tree straps. From what I gathered I shouldn't need the continuous loops at all at least at first. Thanks for the help, and I'll be posting a picture once I get everything in the mail next week!"
Hammocks,31qem0,thatonedudeyeah,3,Wed Apr 8 22:57:13 2015 UTC,"No problem, the continuous loops would have been nice since they are less bulky and lighter, but you will be happy with your Dutch stuff I promise you."
Hammocks,31qem0,Jrose152,2,Thu Apr 9 00:12:25 2015 UTC,"my plan is to just thread the whoopie slings through the tunnels of the ends of the hammock, so would I have even needed the continuous loops? From what i understand I'd only need those if I was using like a clip or something or they'd just add another piece between the hammock itself and the whoopie slings, seemingly unnecessary?"
Hammocks,31qem0,thatonedudeyeah,3,Thu Apr 9 00:43:00 2015 UTC,"No, you clip the whoopie hook onto the continuous loop and the whoopie sling then goes to the tree strap. Did you get whoopie hooks?"
Hammocks,31qem0,Jrose152,2,Thu Apr 9 01:32:27 2015 UTC,"No I just bought 2 whoopie slings and then tree straps. A few videos I watched online showed guys replacing the factory ""loops"" by removing them and then threading a whoopie sling through the tunnel, doubling it back through then tightening it. That's through the fixed loop end of the whoopie. Then they used the adjustable end over the marlin knot made into the tree sling and it seemed to work very well. If need be I'll order the continuous loop and another few clips but that seemed unnecessary from the videos I watched today, and without the loops or hooks I saved like 20 bucks."
Hammocks,31qem0,thatonedudeyeah,2,Thu Apr 9 02:23:38 2015 UTC,"Not necessary at all, just my personal preference. Atlas straps will work fine for this hammock with the stock rope.

I swapped them out with Cinch Buckles on 15"" Amsteel Continuous Loops and 12ft Polyester Tree Straps. Highly recommend it, as the new system saved about half a pound and is much easier to get back into the stuff sack since there's less bulk.  To install the Cinch Buckles, remove the rope, thread the Continuous Loops through the end channels of your hammock, then pull the cinch buckle back through the loop like this, and pull tight.  To hang it up, wrap the Tree Strap around the tree and pull the tail through the loop, like this, then thread the tail into the Cinch Buckle like so and pull the straps until you get the desired angle at each end."

The YO tarps have almost a 12' ridgeline (11'10""), and your hammock isn't going to take up 10' once it's hung -- closer to 9' with the sag. Even if the Roo is longer than that, you've got quite a lot of room to play with."

Hammocks,31qem0,jmonir,2,Tue Apr 7 20:14:07 2015 UTC,"The YO definitely over-reports its hammock length -- I think they're including their stock ropes in their measurement, too -- but if the Roo's body really is just 10' you're totally fine.

They don't give exact specs for their fabric in any of their hammocks, but I notice that this new camo ""Made in USA"" hammock that has the higher weight limit is also almost 4oz heavier than the earlier ones that still show a 300lbs limit. They both appear to be identical otherwise, so that would have to be down to heavier fabric. Here's YO's page that lists both types.  I have a double from back when YO was still rating them for 400lbs, and with whoopies in it's at 1lbs 3oz. So it was likely heavier than the current doubles when it still had its stock suspension, which would mean that they're probably using thinner lighter fabric there now."
Hammocks,31qem0,HeyRememberThatTime,2,Tue Apr 7 13:59:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info. They must be following the ""less is more"" plan that seems to be happening these days."

Hammocks,31qem0,Jrose152,2,Wed Apr 8 01:20:20 2015 UTC,"Are the double hammocks good for two people, does anyone know?  Our usage would likely be for cuddling/chilling out/snacking while camping and less actual sleeping in it (except naps).  Do you tend to fall into the middle with two people, or can it be comfortable?"
Hammocks,31qem0,queenofcheebah,3,Tue Apr 7 14:10:59 2015 UTC,"I have a double. It gets a bit cramped, as do most double hammocks, when you have two people in it. It is great for some cuddle and lounging time, but I wouldn't recommend sleeping in it. A double does give you a bit more fabric when you lay and can be more comfortable to sleep in solo."

Hammocks,31qem0,Jrose152,2,Tue Apr 7 15:05:48 2015 UTC,Making your own net is a better idea. The bugs will still bite you through the bottom of the hammock.

Hammocks,31qem0,Jrose152,2,Thu Apr 9 00:33:41 2015 UTC,You would be fine that way. You just need to make sure you had something under you because with an integrated bug net hammock you are basically a hanging blood sack.

Or should I just keep my fatass on the ground. The digital camo one is rated to 500lbs, but it seems like most people go for the double when they're going solo.  I forgot to mention, my intent is to use these while camping. I've read I can make my own bugnet for them if needed; as it sounds like the net-version is way too short for tall folk."

Hammocks,31qem0,HeyRememberThatTime,1 point,Tue Apr 7 19:34:37 2015 UTC,"The camo model is still very new. Actually, this is the first time that I've seen the camo one specifically, which YO is calling a ""V2"" of the hammock that they announced late last year.  So they've really not been out all that long for people to be talking much about them. Also, I'm pretty sure that the V1 Made in USA model was something more like $40-$45 when they showed up, so folks may not have jumped on them much at the time because at that price you probably start looking toward some of the cottage vendors.  You'll probably find the bugnet hammock to be too small for you. The double will definitely fit you, but you may or may not be bothered by the floppy sides once you're in it for the night. Just judging from the quoted sizes, since I haven't seen one in person, I'd bet that you'd also do OK in the camo hammock. At your height I wouldn't want to go much under 10', and 11' is really going to be better."

Hammocks,31qem0,Jrose152,2,Tue Apr 7 19:37:53 2015 UTC,"If you return any, post them on /r/GearTrade or pm me and sell them back to the community. People are always looking for the Woot deal to pop up and if you return it, they will just end up sitting in a warehouse."

I ordered an olive bug net one, as well as the earth/dark green double. I may just end up selling/returning all of them too as I look into this stuff more, I've already got a pretty good ground camping setup so I'm not sure if jumping into this hammock deal will be the best idea just yet."
Hammocks,31qem0,Jrose152,1 point,Wed Apr 8 02:14:43 2015 UTC,"Its always good to have a hammock to lounge with or set up at the campsite for a chair. I actually sleep in a double every night, I have it set up in my room."
Hammocks,31qem0,Jrose152,1 point,Wed Apr 8 03:29:16 2015 UTC,"My suggestion is order some continuous loops from dutch to replace the ones that come with the hammock, intact get your whole suspension from dutch, but most importantly. Get an adjustable structural ridge line. This goes from loop to loop and you want it at 83% of the actual length of the hammock. It gets you a perfect consistent hang/sag every time no matter how your suspension is hung. You will always have that 30degree sag and can't just sling up to the tree without having to make adjustments. I sleep in a YO double every night."
Hammocks,31qem0,nostrebhtuca,2,Tue Apr 7 22:00:58 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, I'm looking at the Amsteel Continuous Loops on dutchwaregear.com. Do I need the 8"" or 15""? I see the structural and adjustable ridge line for $8 there as well, what else is needed to get my ass off the ground if I'm ordering from dutchware? Thanks!"
Hammocks,31qem0,Jrose152,2,Tue Apr 7 22:19:10 2015 UTC,"I think the woopie hooks have a drop down box to add woopie slings(the lines) and tree straps so you can add it all to one order at once. As far as the length of the continuous loops I don't remember there being an option for different lengths. I would suggest for the ridge line to get the adjustable woopie line. This way you can measure out the 83% and get it set and then fine tune it to how you like it from there. Shoot dutch an email, he's very friendly and an active dude in the hammock community. We all support dutch and love his gear. Email him and hell explain everything you need. I'm on my phone at the moment so I can't go back and forth to check out his site and send you links, but what you want basically is continuous loops to replace your loops in the hammock(unless you are buying the new camo v2 hammock because I heard it comes with lightweight ones already, then from there you'll have a woopie hook, and a woopie sling amsteel line going to your tree straps. Should be around 35-40$ for the whole suspension setup with a structural ridge line."

Doubled, it is effective in binding lines of different diameter or rigidity securely together, although it has a tendency to work loose when not under load.  The sheet bend is related in structure to the bowline. It is very fast to tie, and along with the bowline and clove hitch is considered so essential it is knot №1 in the Ashley Book of Knots.  It is a more secure replacement for the reef knot (square knot), especially in its doubled variety.   The ""weaver's knot"" takes its common name from its historic use in textile mills. Even in modern operations, weavers are taught to use this particular knot when correcting broken threads in the warp. In practice, weavers are taught to be able to tie the knot in as little time possible, with the mean average being no more than three to five seconds.

Hammocks,31oiul,Bigman675,6,Mon Apr 6 22:32:18 2015 UTC,"The eno carabiners are small and have a pretty sharp angle on the fat end of the carabiner.  When you load them on the eno straps, that sharp angle means that the outside stitches are taking more of the load than the inside stitches, and the uneven load starts to wear on the stitching, leading to this.  If you use a full sized climbing biner with flatter profile (my friend uses black diamond neutrinos and they work fine) you should have less of this kind of problem.  The eno carabiners are ok to get started, but a full size climbing biner is so much nicer to use, imo."

Hammocks,31oiul,Roomslinger,2,Sat Apr 11 05:43:25 2015 UTC,"No worries.  Doing 3 or more bartacks is pretty comparable to a box stitch, though there is an even better way which involved making /// pattern, but it is more time consuming and they probably have a 3-4 needled bartacking machine that runs through thousands of these in a week.    It seems like it could have been hung in a way that caused more stress, or there was a lot of dynamic force.  Also it is odd that there would be continuous strain on one loop, since atlas straps have multiple attachment points in a daisy chain, which is why I think it's a simple mechanical error, easy replacement."

Hammocks,31lfn0,Barefootdrifter,1 point,Mon Apr 6 05:12:45 2015 UTC,"Some parts of California you might not need a rain fly, but I feel like if you're going to be in Oregon I'd definitely get a rain tarp. Bugs, I can't say anything specifically because I haven't been camping in either California or Oregon (yet, unfortunately) but they're not cheap and I feel like it can't hurt. Sleeping pads are good, but depending on the time of the year you're planning to do the trip you might want to get an under quilt. When you use sleeping bags in hammocks, the weight of your body compresses all the filling and it doesn't provide for much insulation."

Hammocks,31j6tq,wikster2014,2,Mon Apr 6 07:06:35 2015 UTC,It's a structural ridgeline. Helps to maintain the correct hang sag when putting up
Hammocks,31j6tq,rd1701,2,Mon Apr 6 08:50:42 2015 UTC,"It is a structural Ridge line. The purpose of it is to keep the same amount of sag no matter how you hang the straps. It works like this because the cord (which doesn't stretch btw) is shorter than the hammock, so when it is pulled taught, the hammock is at the perfect amount of sag.   I can also use it to hang a flashlight or water bottle   I'm not very good at explaining things over comments, but there are lots of better explanations and videos on the Internet about it"

Hammocks,318tqz,smells17,6,Thu Apr 2 22:29:29 2015 UTC,"Yes. Well, you'll need a couple of stakes for the side guylines if you intend to use them, but that should be it. No, the tarps don't come with any lines. You'll need four lines and stakes for the corners and either two more for the ridgeline or use a continuous ridgeline (this can just be a longer length of line with some knots, or you could purchase something like Dutch's CRL). Personally, I much prefer full-length for comfort, but 3/4 and a sit pad is alright if you'd make other use of the sit pad. Otherwise you're not really saving much in the way of pack weight/bulk. Depends on what you value where you're going to draw that line and who you're out with. If I'm out with other adults I'm much more likely to carry my own full setup and let them do the same. When I take my two boys out, though, I'm much more likely to go with a tent since they still are too small to carry all their own gear. Definitely, but bunking directly above and below isn't as comfortable as offsetting on opposite sides of a large tree and then staggering one a little higher and the other a little lower, so you're more like stair steps. Dutch also sells double whoopie hooks with an extra socket for a spreader bar so you can hang two hammocks from the same tree but keep their head ends pushed apart.   Edit: I'd also add that the Edge might be a little on the small side to try to squeeze two people under. If you're really leaning that direction you might want to go bigger there."

I just knocked around on the wall til i thought it sounded more solid. put 5-6 small holes in the wall in that area to find the edges of the stud, marked where i believed the center was, and bored into it with the bigger drill bit. The SS hangers seem very friendly to the straps. They're all rounded and smooth and dont cause the straps to get squeezed width-wise.  Definitely a sturdy kit.  I actually lowered the hammock a bit by lengthening the straps after this was shot and now it's much more comfy. your feet can rest straight out on the chase lounge, you can push on it to swing, and the sides of the hammock dont ride so high.

Hammocks,3157p8,CatSplat,2,Thu Apr 2 04:10:23 2015 UTC,"A better comparison would be between a Blackbird and the Asym zip. I have a Blackbird XLC, dad has a Ridgerunner, and my buddy has a Asym Zip so I have experience with the three.  The first decision would be between a bridge or gathered end. The bridge will have an inherently flatter lay but it is not nearly as stable as a gathered end. Doesn't really matter when you are actually sleeping but when you are getting in and out of the hammock. A gathered end also doesn't need as much space between the two trees. Also they generally weigh a bit less than a bridge. I personally prefer a gathered end.  Now between a Warbonnet and a Hennessy. They are very similar but are made from different materials, the Warbonnet being a bit more ""silky."" Also the tie downs are in different locations, the Hennessy having one by the feet and the other by the torso and the Warbonnet having both by the torse. Also the Warbonnet has a shelf built in and but you can get a ridgeline organizer for a Hennessy if you so choose.   I am most happy with my Blackbird but its really like a Ford vs Chevy kinda deal."

Hammocks,3157p8,CatSplat,2,Thu Apr 2 13:25:24 2015 UTC,"It's probably worth noting that the double-layer on the WBBB is optional, and that Hennessey (among many others) also offer dual-layer hammocks in case one wants to use a pad instead of an underquilt.

Hammocks,310nf1,shroom_throwaway9722,2,Wed Apr 1 20:53:51 2015 UTC,"Super cool. I have been sleeping in a hammock for about at a year now. Started off in an Eno and moved to the Brazillian a few months ago.  I'm in love with it and don't plan to ever go back to a bed. My back doesn't ache, I sleep really well. It's full win.  I have a cheap poly fill quilt I fold in half and place in the hammock, lay on top of to keep the chill off my back.  Use a nice fuzzy warm blanket from Costco on top. Cool trick, I cut a triangular piece of fabric and sewed it on to a corner of the blanket (so it makes a pocket) I get in the hammock, pop my feet in the pocket and it pulls the blanket over/around me perfectly with out any fussing.  I have a small slender pillow I made. I usually sleep on my side, but end up on my back. I use the pillow on my side but never end up with it under my head in the morning, and it's fine.   I have installed 3 sets of eye hooks around the house and move the thing around. My 7 year old daughter tried out my hammock and loved it, so I hung a brazillian in her room. We ditched her bed about 3 months ago. Her buddies are all jealous :-)   I am fascinated with the kind of lumbar and body support that hammocks provide. It would be interesting if someone with way more time and physics training studied how it works and how it affects the body. I personally feel like my hammock is far and away more comfortable than expensive mattresses.  They do take a little more effort to play around with though. Small price to pay.  Only down side is that they take a bit to get into and situated. I have forgotten my phone, etc after getting all snuggled in and it's sucky to get out and back into.   Happy hanging!"

For the top ""quilt"", a mummy-style sleeping bag works quite well. You can unzip it all the way, lay it zipper side down, and use it as a blanket with a foot box. The foot box is very convenient since it doesn't move around and won't let in drafts."
Hammocks,310nf1,savethetransithotel,2,Wed Apr 1 23:06:54 2015 UTC,"I have been sleeping in a hammock for the past... two nights.  My last bed was an air mattress which popped after six months.  As I was doing my research to decide what to replace it with, I somehow came across some information on hammocks.  I looked deeper, and couldn't find anything (credible) against them, and the portability/compactness factor appealed to me, so I decided to give it a shot.  After pestering you guys with my newb questions, I decided to get this hammock, and I made a pipe stand following this design.  I hang it with nylon slings.  The slings are kept from falling by my Red Green style pipe clamps.  (Sleeves from an old shirt and duct tape).  I have proper straps, but they're useless on the stand.  My hammock was shy of $75, the materials for my stand were a little over $200, cleaning supplies for the pipe were about $7.50, and some other things I bought but ended up not using (like the straps) were about $35.  All told, I spent somewhere in the neighbourhood of $325.  So how has that investment paid off?  Sleep:  Surprisingly, I still have some discomfort in my lower back, but I'm a side sleeper.  It is very comfortable when laying on your back, but I cannot do that for very long.  Still the discomfort is less than other sleeping surfaces.  The hammock naturally tries to shift you onto your back, but so far I have stayed in the position I fell asleep in.  I have not yet fallen asleep faster or had a deeper sleep.  My hammock has been more comfortable than a bed so far, but my sleeping experience is otherwise the same.  I have heard some people haven't been happy with pillows in the hammock.  Fortunately, I haven't had any problems.  I don't have any problems with warmth either.  My apartment has crazy insulation, and my stand is by my radiator.  In the end, I gained a bit more comfort, and a lot more room.  I have also made moving a lot easier.  So even though it hasn't lived up to my expectations, I think it's still been worthwhile."

Hammocks,30s33u,widgetjam,10,Mon Mar 30 13:27:48 2015 UTC,"A lot more than that. Seventeen people, figure 150 per person, add a bit more for the equipment and you're looking at about 2,600lbs. Those are pines, about 18-20"" in diameter it looks like. Between the two of them it's no problem to handle this kind of weight."
Hammocks,30s33u,TimberWolfAlpha,2,Mon Mar 30 15:07:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i'd guess 2 ft of tree weights probably 150lbs so I'd doubt the trees really notice"
Hammocks,30s33u,clue2more,5,Mon Mar 30 18:24:32 2015 UTC,"Interestingly enough you're not that far off, about 175lbs actually. It's a relatively simple statics problem to figure out the bending moment those hammocks are applying to the trees. You can make it as complex as you want with respect to the slowly tapering trunk, unequal distribution of hammocks etc, but the short answer is that the load on the trunks of the trees is no where near enough to cause issues."

You really don't have a lot of room to play with an A-frame pitch at just 3m.  When I first started hammock camping I used a standard yard tarp (8'x10') on the diagonal pretty much the same as you're describing, but I did use a continuous-ridgeline-style pitch more or less like this. What I like about it is that I can center and tighten the tarp all from one end, so I don't have to go back and forth, and with the extra mechanical advantage of coming back through the tarp I've never had any trouble getting it good and tight.  Even now, I still use that style ridgeline pitch with my hammocking tarps, though I did also get a Dutchware continuous ridgeline recently that I like a lot, too."
Hammocks,30p9fy,HeyRememberThatTime,2,Sun Mar 29 22:09:22 2015 UTC,"Great, thanks. That first link was exactly what I was looking for; a simple way of rigging and tightening with minimal hardware. Dutchware ridgeline looks pretty nifty too though."

Although they're not necessary, a couple of small carabiners at the tarp's tie-outs make setting it up a little easier, too, as you don't have to thread the entire length of line through anything. I use a couple of small S-biners myself just because I had them lying around."
Hammocks,30p9fy,Purple-Is-Delicious,2,Sun Mar 29 23:50:47 2015 UTC,"I use a continuous ridgeline.     I spliced one end to a Ti Dutch Biner and clip that to the D-ring of the foot end of my tarp. I run the line around the tree, and through the same D-ring I clipped my dutch biner to.  I run the line through the opposite D-ring of my tarp at my head end, around the tree, then I tie off to the Dutch Stinger that is clipped to the D-ring of that end of my tarp. At this point I can slide the tarp back and forth and adjust it over my hammock as the ridgeline is allowed to move with the tarp. Once I have it where I want, I cinch it taught. For Tieouts at the 4 corners of my rectangular tarp, I use LineLoc3's that are sewn into my tarp rather than D-rings I do one side at a time, so I'll sink my stake and hook the loop that I spliced into my tieout lines onto the stake and then cinch it through the lineloc3 till it's taught."

If you aren't comfortable with knots, this video covers most of the hardware available from Dutchware that allows you to quickly and securely hang tarps without tying knots."

It has a shorter overall length (9') compared to full size (15') stands, with the cords wrapped over the arm ends of the stand and fastened further down their length. It can be set up on pretty much any relatively flat solid terrain, and has the benefit of working even when it's not attached to a SUV."

The standalone version of the stand is also available, but for the price (especially when <$100) the hammock it comes with is not a bad deal and fairly comfortable. It's my impression that when using other 3rd party parachute hammocks with this that they're less than entirely comfortable for a full night's sleep; I suspect that these do best when spread out with 15'-20' of space between trees.

As long as you do normal hangs a couple feet above ground the worst that happens is you fall on your ass anyways. Don't do any exposed cliffy hangs though with old webbing.   It's weather, not just time, that compromises gear. Hanging on metal poles in your yard? You're set. Hanging on a sappy tree in a rain storm? You're webbing will wear down a lot faster."

Hammocks,30fstt,Jrose152,4,Fri Mar 27 22:15:34 2015 UTC,"I apologize. I'm pretty new to hammocking, what exactly do you mean by this?"
Hammocks,30fstt,Jrose152,5,Fri Mar 27 23:01:20 2015 UTC,"No problem at all. I figured you were by the hang. We always welcome questions here. What you want is a 30degree sag on your hammock suspension coming off the tree. This is known as the sweet spot for getting that diagonal flat comfortable lay. Your hammocks, especially the top one do not have much sag at all.  This calculator will show you what I mean over on the right called ""hang angle"". That being said, it's difficult to calculate that when you are out setting up so what you want to do is buy an adjustable structural ridge line.  A structural ridgeline is a line that goes from end to end on your hammock. You want to measure your hammock length(not listen to website specs) and have the SRL be 83% of the length of your hammock. You can buy an adjustable whoopie one from Dutchwaregear for 6$. This is what I use on my indoor and outdoor hammock. I sleep in mine every night. What this does is locks in your sag to 30 degrees and pretty much no matter how you hang it you will always have the same exact sag so you don't have to try and guess it when you are out setting it up. In my opinion every hammock should have one. Here is a photo of one. If you are going to order from Dutch, I'd suggest grabbing some contentious loops from him also to replace the ones that came with your hammock. They are cheap and lighter. Happy to answer any more questions you have. This image might also shed some light for you.  Edit: Excuse the mess, but here is an image of my hammock with a SRL I sleep in every night."

Hammocks,30c0c3,realoldfatguy,2,Fri Mar 27 05:11:14 2015 UTC,"Few people would advise actually sleeping in the same hammock. Dutchware sells a Double Whoopie Hook suspension system for hanging two hammocks side-by-side, between two trees."
Hammocks,30c0c3,realoldfatguy,3,Thu Mar 26 18:10:09 2015 UTC,"I looked at a lot of different hammocks and researched them until I my brain was pretty much fried. I finally decided on a Grand Trunk Skeeter Beeter Pro for about $70.  It includes a bug net, straps, etc.  If you don't need the net, just flip it over.  I've added a set of whoopie slings  ($15) to give me more flexibility when hanging, a pair of 15 foot tow straps ($10 total) and a structural ridgeline ($10).  This pretty much lets me hang anywhere and everywhere. The tow straps are 2-3 inches wide so they will not damage trees.  I just recently added a DD Underquilt for $95 and a DD sleeve for $16.  I have not had the chance to use these yet, but they will let me use the hammock in colder weather.   The sleeve simply slides down over the hammock, underquilt and all the suspension stuff making it quick and easy to take down and set up.    I have a couple of tarps and am still working out how I want to rig those and I built a turtle-dog stand ($25 for the materials to make this, pattern is over at Hammock Forums.) which works great in the back yard or anyplace else where there are no trees.  I have heard nothing but good things about ENO hammocks as well.  I just liked that the GTSBP included the bug net (which I use, living in Iowa)."
Hammocks,30c0c3,Charlemagne712,3,Thu Mar 26 03:29:40 2015 UTC,Is DD  a brand or what? I'm still pretty new to this.. And I'm not sure what a ridgeline is either. We'll probably need that bug net once it gets into the warmer months.
Hammocks,30c0c3,realoldfatguy,6,Thu Mar 26 03:36:14 2015 UTC,"DD Hammocks is based in the UK.  I ordered the stuff on Friday and it was at my door the following Tuesday.  A structural ridgeline goes above your hammock, between the hooks that attach to your straps on each end.  It should be about 83% to 85% of the length of your hammock when it is laid out flat.  This helps keep the angle of the hammock pretty much uniform, no matter if your straps are higher or lower.  Makes it very easy to set up and fine tune your hammock. If you want a flatter hang, lengthen the ridgeline. If you want a little steeper hang, shorten it.  Once you have it set, you just leave it attached.    Hammock Forums is the place to go to learn about this stuff. Shug does some great videos."
Hammocks,30c0c3,faceny,1 point,Thu Mar 26 03:44:23 2015 UTC,"I'm looking at their UQ and comparing it to the ENO ember 2, the DD has a better temperature rating, but im confused by the carabiners. The pictures make it look like you clip it onto your hammock?"
Hammocks,30c0c3,Charlemagne712,1 point,Thu Mar 26 20:59:00 2015 UTC,"There are 8 carabiners attached to the UQ with shock cord.  The two carabiners on each end have a cord lock in the middle. This allows you to attach each end (where your hammock attaches to your suspension/straps) then gather each end using the cord lock to snug it up.   There are four more places where shock cord is attached with carabiners (two on each side). These can either be attached to the side of your hammock (DD Hammocks have tabs in place for this) or bring them up over the top and attach them to your ridgeline. This keeps the UQ centered under the hammock, but these are not required, just a nice additional feature."
Hammocks,30c0c3,faceny,1 point,Fri Mar 27 13:42:22 2015 UTC,I use both the DD underquilt and snakeskin ('sleeve') and they're great. I slept outside for 2 weeks in 0C and the UQ kept me warm & toasty. The snakeskin allows me to set up in seconds and to keep everything up off the ground & dry.
Hammocks,30c0c3,ReallyNotABro,2,Thu Mar 26 15:47:14 2015 UTC,How does the UQ attach to the hammock
Hammocks,30c0c3,TXN4L1F3,1 point,Thu Mar 26 20:59:30 2015 UTC,The UQ attaches to the hammock suspension at each end using shock cords and mini carabiners and to a ridgline also using cords and mini carabiners. In total the UQ has 8 attachment points - 2 at each end and 2 on each long side.
Hammocks,30c0c3,OddTheViking,1 point,Fri Mar 27 09:57:41 2015 UTC,I got my skeeter beater Christmas before last and have gotten great usage out of it. Even without an under quilt or augmentations I've used it many times in Georgia and had no complaints.
Hammocks,30c0c3,elevatedmovemENT,1 point,Thu Apr 2 00:47:21 2015 UTC,"As has been mentioned, ENO is OK, but far from the best. Its a good ""starter hammock"" but if you plan on buying nice instead of buying twice, then I would personally go another route. I noticed you mentioned a rain fly, so I assume you plan on taking it camping. I have never heard of anyone getting a comfortable night sleep with 2 people in one hammock, regardless of brand. If this is your goal, you either want a Clark Vertex hammock (basically give each of you your own hammock bed in one enclosure), or you will need 2 separate hammocks. The ENO is too short for most people to get a properly flat diagonal lay (ENOs are about 9' 6"", where as 10'-11' is most peoples comfort length), and the strap suspension is incredibly heavy and bulky. A whoopie sling suspension is lighter, and not at all difficult once you learn how to use it. Most hammockers on this sub use ENOs, and mostly just for lounging, so most stick with it because it is all they have tried. I suggest checking out /r/hammockcamping, Shug Emery's hammocks for beginners series on YouTube is a must watch for any hammock camper, and hammockforums.net is far and away the nest online resource of educated advice, backed with years of experience and trial and error. Happy hanging!"

Hammocks,30c0c3,idgafau5,2,Fri Mar 27 00:27:46 2015 UTC,"Spent 3 months backpacking the Hawaii islands with the safari double deluxe.    It's massive, isn't lightweight, but if you are two averaged sized people it works.  Had a blast hanging around the islands with it and it was better than trying to find trees close to each other to hang one for her and one of me, or bunking, which makes the trip less intimate.    It's not the same as sleeping in one by yourself, but I found it works well if you hang it correctly and use the side pull outs."
Hammocks,30c0c3,mcphatty84,2,Sun Mar 29 06:14:54 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but you did buy a hyped brand name. There is no back and forth; the ENO fans have only used ENO products. Their hammocks are generally to short (under 10'), and everything they make is heavy. You can find better, lighter, cheaper products made by cottage vendors.   I have a feeling that ENO has turned a lot of people off of hammocks."
Hammocks,30c0c3,MoldyCat,20,Thu Mar 26 08:50:12 2015 UTC,"While you're right about most of that, to say ENO turned a lot of people off to hammocks is a completely biased statement which probably stems from the fact that there's a lot more people into hammocks now because of ENO and that irritates you. I'd say there's more people with hammocks now than the amount of people who for some reason decided they aren't ""hip"" anymore because a lot of people buy them now."
Hammocks,30c0c3,DoktorKruel,4,Thu Mar 26 16:36:31 2015 UTC,"My first (and currently only) hammock is an ENO. I would say without ENO being mainstream I may not have ever gotten into camping in hammocks, which just the point you're trying to make."
Hammocks,30c0c3,mrjowee,1 point,Fri Mar 27 19:56:24 2015 UTC,My Double ENO has been the only hammock I have found that can support my weight and didn't cost me an entire month's of pay.

I have a Warbonnet Blackbird XLC and I love it...for camping and serious outdoors stuff. I hate it for lounging around in a city park or hanging in my basement. My ENO DN is a perfect fit for those times the XLC is not ideal.   There's nothing ""wrong"" with the ENO. It's not Tier-1 quality or weight, but it's also not Tier-1 price. It's a simple design that is a nice introduction to hammocking for a newbie. Just enjoy it. Go camp in it a few times, then see about upgrading if you're really into it."
Hammocks,30c0c3,Aforcedfart,4,Thu Mar 26 16:30:06 2015 UTC,"To elaborate, ENO doesn't include instructions on how to hang a hammock. What's more, many of their social media pics show people with very little sag in their hammock, no underquilt, hanging in precarious locations, and so on. So their product is well advertised to an ill informed consumer. Someone may buy a hammock because they read about them online or it looks comfortable, only to string it up banjo tight, lay in it like a banana, and not bother with any bottom insulation. Then they post in/r/CampingandHiking that they tried hammock camping and it's just not for them."
Hammocks,30c0c3,Aforcedfart,3,Thu Mar 26 13:07:44 2015 UTC,"Next you'll be telling me that a 50ºF underquilt won't ""protect me from winter's nastiness"" and that this isn't the way to sleep in a hammock.  Honestly, I was more or less of the different-strokes-for-different-folks school about ENO before they released that Ember 2 and tried to market it as being for winter camping. That goes beyond a matter of opinion or marketing puffery, and into the realm of the downright irresponsible."

There are better brands out there but an ENO is a good hammock. But for ODIN""S SAKE LEARN HOW TO HANG  IT RIGHT, not to tight not to loose.

Hammocks,30c0c3,OddTheViking,2,Thu Mar 26 05:00:20 2015 UTC,"Yea, we bought a tarp like that and tried setting it up last night. It was less than spectacular to say the least.

Hammocks,30c0c3,Jrose152,1 point,Thu Mar 26 16:46:56 2015 UTC,If you get good at tying knots(tauntline hitch) you can actually just use one cut of rope per connection(I leave them tied to the actual fly/tarp) and adjust them to fit the needs of that adventure.

Hammocks,30botb,recover66,0,Sat Mar 28 01:41:14 2015 UTC,I would actually suggest a water knot. Really simple and commonly used to join two lengths of cord
Hammocks,30botb,fromkentucky,1 point,Thu Mar 26 02:38:35 2015 UTC,Water knots are for webbing. Fisherman's knots hold much better with rope.
Hammocks,30botb,isthisoneinvalidtoo,2,Thu Mar 26 17:36:39 2015 UTC,Water knots are most commonly used to join or tie webbing...
Hammocks,30botb,AFlemeister,1 point,Thu Mar 26 02:53:06 2015 UTC,Except this is accessory cord.

The best way to form accessory cord into a loop is a Double Fisherman's.  If you don't want to do that, you could do a Flemish Bend."
Hammocks,30botb,fromkentucky,1 point,Thu Mar 26 03:38:24 2015 UTC,I'd retie it as a single Fisherman's knot or a Zeppelin Bend.
Hammocks,30botb,realoldfatguy,1 point,Thu Mar 26 17:37:06 2015 UTC,"I would use the same knot, but instead, tie the knot before running it through the gathered end. Once it is tied, run it through the gathered end (it will be two pieces this time) and make a larkshead. This will then be holding the entire section with two lines inside of one (doubling the weight it will hold) and when you attach it to your suspension, it will be pulling the knots tighter instead of pulling them apart."
Hammocks,30botb,Jrose152,1 point,Fri Mar 27 15:36:36 2015 UTC,"Hmm that's a really good idea. I would definitely try it, except I already tied a double fisherman's knot so idk if I can untie it 😕"

Suge has a lot of useful info in his videos, and he shows a few different ways to hang in this series, to give you some ideas. Instead of using a Dutch clip, I use these, mostly because they're locally available.   Also, here are basic instructions for making whoopie slings. Just make sure you buy Amsteel blue to be sure they'll hold (if you haven't seen this stuff, it's amazing. A 7/64"" diameter cord will support 1600 lbs).  I like this setup because it's really light, quick to put up, doesn't damage the trees, can be hung in fairly wide gaps if needed, and with the whoopie slings, adjusts incredibly quickly."
Hammocks,2zwuww,Alejo90100,1 point,Mon Mar 23 13:09:39 2015 UTC,this sounds cool but how do you go about attaching the hammock to the strap? do you tighten the cam buckles all the way around the tree and clip the hammock on? sorry for so many questions :P

The whoopie slings have one end tied to the hammock just below the whipping, and the other end is hung on the marlin spike hitch.

Hammocks,2zwuww,ezshucks,0,Tue Mar 24 19:30:19 2015 UTC,what's the point of stacking hammocks?
Hammocks,2zzen5,Fenrjsulfr,1 point,Mon Mar 23 05:17:52 2015 UTC,"If you're using typical hammocking angles (e.g., the ""ideal"" 30º), they're taken from horizontal down to the suspension. Another way to look at it is to use the internal angle from one suspension line to the other, like this excellent more generic explanation does, in which case the hammocking 30º is the same as a 120º internal angle.  The angle of your anchoring surface doesn't change the amount of force being applied by the hammock; it just changes how the structure you're anchoring into will bear it.  Had you been anchoring just into the sheetrock before? If so, you definitely don't want to be doing that."
Hammocks,2zzen5,HeyRememberThatTime,1 point,Mon Mar 23 12:44:23 2015 UTC,"I was anchored into a true 2x6.  From what I can tell from attic access, the 2x6 acts as a rafter to the roof on the outside, and frame for wall on the inside.  There is a layer of boards (6"" wide, 1/2""thick), then sheetrock.  The screw heads that are popping through the sheetrock are not lined up with the studs, just attached to the board layer.  Honestly, I don't know why they are showing through.  Even if I had missed the stud, it would pull the sheetrock off of the screws, not pull the screws through the sheetrock.  Maybe it was jut enough flex to crack the mud over the screw, making it look like the screws are pressing through.  Until I have time to get a better view in the attic, I'm not hanging from it."
Hammocks,2zzen5,HeyRememberThatTime,1 point,Mon Mar 23 20:14:05 2015 UTC,"Oh, from your description I was picturing dimpling around screw heads, like the sheet was being pulled out around them, and the edge of the sheet pulling up at the seam. If you mean the reverse -- that the screw heads are popping -- I'm with you. I don't see why that would happen.  Assuming that you're right about the beams being the actual rafters and not separate internal framing, I would think you'd actually be better off hanging from them than normal wall studs. They'd be built to carry a load in the direction your suspension would be pulling vs. studs not really being meant to be loaded laterally."

Hammocks,2zq7qr,imcgrat2,-2,Fri Mar 20 20:58:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think the gate being closed would have any impact on the strength of the carabiner. ENO just ships out dog shit carabiners.

Hammocks,2zq7qr,RaynorShine,10,Fri Mar 20 20:45:54 2015 UTC,"FWIW, Eno and most other brands report approximately triple load capacity when the gate is closed.  Stainless Steel Wire Gate > Aluminum Body  With the gate open, they should each still be good for 7kN (roughly 1500lbs) so I think the pot metal used on these unsupervised Chinese forgings is probably more to blame than portliness   EDIT: for anybody that's interested, mute your speakers and check out this gate open vs gate closed test"

Unfortunately, carabiners can fail at loads well below their rated strength when they're used incorrectly or if they're loaded with their gates open.   http://m.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/carabiners.html  Example  With mine the load limit closed is 24kN along the major axis, while only 10kN open."
Hammocks,2zq7qr,footstepsfading,1 point,Fri Mar 20 21:35:22 2015 UTC,"The shape of the carabiner ensures that the lead is placed along the closed side of the carabiner (opposite the gate). This effectively means that the rope is pulling on a point that, of you consider the bends at the ends of the biner to be hinges at which they can bend, the rope applies force at the short end of a long lever. The wire gate therefore doesn't have to be that strong to considerably strengthen the top (and to a lesser extent the bottom) arms of the carabiner."

Hammocks,2zq1te,steveflinn,2,Fri Mar 20 18:16:46 2015 UTC,Yep. Whoopie slings and straps are the only way to fly. You can make your own or buy them for about the same price.
Hammocks,2zq1te,mornsbarstool,-2,Fri Mar 20 19:38:13 2015 UTC,For what?  I just use paracord for my hammock. Suspension and alterations made to that hammock depends on what the application is.
Hammocks,2zq1te,Osulagh,3,Fri Mar 20 19:02:27 2015 UTC,I personally would not use paracord as it has too much stretch in it. Amstel is the go to for most DIY hammocks. Please refer to this thread on how to make a whoopie sling. https://www.hammockforums.net/forum/showthread.php/9349-Whoopie-Sling-Suspension
Hammocks,2zq1te,dag33k,1 point,Fri Mar 20 19:15:00 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't use paracord either. For suspension, no, but the hammock, yes. The OP isn't asking what the best cord is for suspension, but for the hammock.  Amsteel is rather stiff and doesn't take a knot well, so using it in your whipping can allow the hammock ends to slip from the knot."

Hammocks,2zmz4x,Kirkatron713,6,Thu Mar 19 22:47:47 2015 UTC,"Looks great! It was definitely a smart idea to use a wood block for mounting to the wall.  I want to make two pointers though. Most people mount the wood block horizontally in order to distribute the load over multiple studs.  Mounting vertically does not allow this type of load distribution, which is the main reason why people use this mounting scheme.  Also, having the eye-bolt so off-center means that the top screws have a much higher load on them.  You would have better load distribution through your screws if you put put the eye-bolt through the middle of the block instead. Despite all this, I'm jealous of how clean this setup looks compared to the stand that I've got. Good work!"
Hammocks,2zmz4x,greaterscott,5,Fri Mar 20 04:23:36 2015 UTC,"Valid points. I will keep that in mind the next time I build one. Detailed pictures can be seen here. My friend catabre helped me. Since he has built multiple mounts in this fashion, we just used what we knew to be tried and true."
Hammocks,2zmz4x,Catabre,2,Fri Mar 20 04:38:20 2015 UTC,"Those points are true, but I've always put the eyebolts up as high as possible so I can get the maximum height range.  As far as mounting the wood horizontally, I felt it would have to be longer than I'd want to get a solid amount of screws in it. However, if I make a mount in the future that will hold two people I will certainly mount the board horizontally.  I'll see if I can dig up my free body diagrams."

Hammocks,2zcqjj,wantobegardener,4,Tue Mar 17 14:32:39 2015 UTC,"You can look for group hangs or hammockers in your area to test things out. Go to Hammockforums and search about.   Well... you can buy a ENO kit at REI, test it out, then return it and get a Dutchware hammock and suspension system... I've heard that some REI are willing to setup  It's just under $30 for a hammock. A Yes4All or Grandtruck Ultralight are cheap, and add in a set of tree straps and you're just under $30 with shipping. Or you can go for a tablecloth hammock with polyester webbing for straps. Or make your own out of a length of ripstop and straps. All of this is less if you can remove the straps, like if you're not hanging from trees.   But then again, $30 as an intro is sort of steep when you think about the possibility if you do like it; I wouldn't stick with that $30 kit, and would recommend a Dutchware (or making your own from Dutch's material) hammock and suspension which would be around that $50 range.   To be honest, unless there's something wrong with your body that even laying in a bed is painful for you, a hammock should be comfortable and if you're uncomfortable laying in a hammock you're doing something wrong."
Hammocks,2zcqjj,Osulagh,2,Tue Mar 17 15:08:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info!  I did call the nearest REI to me and asked them if they had a set up of a hammock, unfortunately they don't.  I went to Dicks and they have the ENO Doublenest and straps, but combined it's $100.  I'm not sure of their return policy but I could just buy the ENO setup, test it out, then return it even if I like it and get something more suitable for backpacking.  Unless of course the ENO is good enough for backpacking.  I'd never heard of Yes4All till just now, but I just found a hammock and straps for $20 + free shipping, I might actually get that right now.  $20 is about what I'm comfortable losing if I don't like it."
Hammocks,2zcqjj,Osulagh,4,Tue Mar 17 15:19:03 2015 UTC,"ENO are fine if you're like 5'6"", but they're a bit overpriced and heavier than I'd prefer for backpacking.  As with any cheap hammock, make sure you check everything on it--stitches, seams, hems, straps. It's not so much about getting the cheapest thing as must as not having the hammock break on you at the start and you breaking your ass on the ground."
Hammocks,2zcqjj,Osulagh,1 point,Tue Mar 17 15:27:29 2015 UTC,"Ok, so length is important.  That $20 one on Yes4All is a foot shorter than ENO.  It's 8'4"", I'm 5'8"" so would that be way to short even for me to decide if it's something I'd like?"
Hammocks,2zcqjj,fromkentucky,2,Tue Mar 17 15:29:47 2015 UTC,"It should be fine to just decide because you're on the shorter side, but perhaps you should go with the Grand Trunk Ultralight as it a foot longer.   If you do enjoy it, look into a 10 foot Dutchware hammock with woopie hook suspension."
Hammocks,2zcqjj,fromkentucky,1 point,Tue Mar 17 15:43:16 2015 UTC,I just looked at the Grand Trunk.. I think I might be too fat for it.  Which also makes me think that the weight limit for the one on Yes4All might be an exaggeration.
Hammocks,2zcqjj,Apocalyptic_Squirrel,1 point,Tue Mar 17 15:46:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly dude, get the Yes4All with straps and try it with a small pillow.   No, it isn't the ideal length, but I have one, I'm 5'-8"" and I definitely prefer sleeping in it instead of an air mattress.   It's $20 to try a hobby that you'll very likely enjoy.    I just got an 11ft Dutchware NylonD in Olive Green. Cost me $37 + shipping and I pieced together my own suspension system. I'm keeping my cheapy hammock for holding gear or as a loaner for friends."
Hammocks,2zcqjj,fromkentucky,2,Tue Mar 17 19:03:42 2015 UTC,"Awesome!  Thanks.  I think no matter how this turns out I'm happy I was able to only spend $20 to get introduced.  I guess my only concern left is my weight, which I am working on but it's going to take some time.  The Yes4All says it holds up to 275 which is more than adequate, but if that is a gross exaggeration at it can only hold 200 then I may be on my ass the first time I try it lol.  I've already ordered it, so I guess we'll see."

A lot of the young kids who start always say they have a bad back after a month or so. When in reality it is back fatigue from both a) not lifting properly and b) being out of shape.  People who have bad backs usually have actual problems with their backs, problems that require surgery or can't be fixed even with numerous surgeries. Way too many people these days associate back pain or back fatigue with ""having a bad back"""

Hammocks,2z3jiq,BosoxH60,2,Fri Mar 20 14:47:00 2015 UTC,How does a novice avoid back fatigue?
Hammocks,2z3jiq,psysium,1 point,Mon Mar 23 15:57:41 2015 UTC,"Well I'm not a physical trainer, but if I had to give advice based on my experience I would say to be in shape, stretch, and condition yourself. A good nights sleep will also probably help. There are a lot of exercises you can do to strengthen your back, but if you're not used to using your back muscles or carrying a pack then I would say you will probably experience some degree of back fatigue.  Keep in mind, a well fit pack will distribute weight through your shoulders, back, and hips. So a good pack will definitely help, along with good shoes. A lot of people don't realize that your feet and the support of your feet translates directly to your lower back. That is why a lot of foot supports and gels are targeted at people who stand for long periods of time or walk for long periods. If your feet don't have proper support then that tension will build up in your knees and lower back.  Day hiking with some weight on your back will help condition yourself, I always carry a little extra weight in my day pack just to help keep me in shape for when I throw on my multi-day pack.  So if I had to sum up my advice, keep in mind this is just based on my experience, I would say:  A) Get a proper fitting pack that distributes weight evenly, as well as properly packing your pack.  B) Have good shoes/boots with good support.  C) Stretch your back and legs before each day and then at the end of the day. Don't over stretch though.  D) Start slow, condition yourself with hikes using lighter weight. Don't start by throwing on a big heavy pack when you've never hiked before or never hiked with a pack."

Yes, a cheapy blue tarp will do, but it'll be twice/thrice the weight as a comparable silnylon tarp--and I'm not even talking a hex/square design. Fine for car camping, but not for backpacking. You can get a silnylon tarp from places like Warbonnet and Wildernesslogics for around $90, but get a spool of Lash-it for the ridgeline and guylines. For $120 to keep the weather off you--which you need in any camping kit--it's well worth the price."

That being said, I have slept relatively comfortably with that setup into the low 30'sF.  I used the 2' wide stuff and hand-sewed the flat parts together and then finished off with 2 layers of duct tape on the seam.  I did the same for the underquilt, but ran shock cord around the outside to tie off to the tree."
Hammocks,2ywndy,IANALAMA,2,Fri Mar 13 15:04:38 2015 UTC,"Tl;dr it won't make adequate insulation on its own, but can be used to extend existing insulation into colder temps.   I have a square I use as a ground sheet, sit pad and occasionally to insulate under my butt, very rarely."

The rainfly will use its own ridgeline, not share the structural, correct?   Correct.   The hammock structural ridgeline is to keep a consistent distance between the two ends of your hammock when hung from suspension, which in turn gives you a consistent sag, which is what gives a gathered end hammock the comfort and let's you lay at a diagonal. It's going to be weight bearing, so having a strong material that doesn't stretch is important. I use an adjustable structural ridgeline from Arrowhead Equipment for my hammocks. Allows me to dial in my sag for my preference. It's whoopie sling style, so really easy to adjust on the fly and will hold under tension.   Tarp ridgeline is basically the suspension for the tarp. Some people use two separate pieces, attached at each end, or one continuous piece that runs the full length between the anchor points, either above or below the tarp. This generally isn't weight bearing, except for some people who use the continuous ridgeline under their tarp to help in snowy conditions, so strength is less important. I use zing it and lash it for tarp ridgeline and guy lines. Light, strong and they hold well on prusiks, which is what I use to get away from using heavy hardware, and simplify the adjustment options."

The structural hammock ridgeline isn't necessarily required, but it makes things waaaaaay easier in the beginning. Definitely a good first step to upgrading your setup.   You could use some dutchware ridgeline biners, they're super lightweight and strong enough, I just slipped mine into my whoopie slings that are  ran through the sewn channel at the ends of the hammock and attached with a lark's head knot. They never come off, so having to disassemble my suspension isn't a concern.   Make sure you check out Shug's YouTube channel. That, and hammock forums, is where I did all of my research."

And if you only attach one side or the other you'd be torquing the plate by hanging off to the side.  If it were me and I absolutely had to mount a hammock to a stud wall, I'd mount a simple eye bolt into a ledger board run across a couple of studs. No way in hell would I hang anything like that from the sheetrock without a stud, as the image name seems to imply.  Still, I would rather hang down from ceiling joists than from studs, myself. At least that way your force is directed in a way that the structure's already built to bear."

MY thought was that the plate would spread the forces better and the multiple holes supply redundancy.  Forget the image name...I did specify drilling directly into the stud.  A ceiling mount is certainly possible, but my ceilings are popcorn and too tall for me to reach, which negates the ""take it down and hide it"" benefit of a hammock hung indoors.  I could easily position them high on the stud wall, where the ends are secured reasonably well...but there is no way I could reach them if mounted on the ceiling.  I could mount on the ceiling, though, and hang down a strap or a chain to move the attachment point low enough for me to reach it.  Hmmm.  Now you've got me thinking."

Forget the image name...I did specify drilling directly into the stud.   Yes, I know you did. I mentioned that more because you probably want to take any advice that you might have gotten wherever you found that image with a grain of salt, particularly if they think you could screw that straight into drywall. The problem with that plate is that it's likely wider than a 2x4 stud on edge, and even if it wasn't you'd be screwing into the very outermost edges of the stud where you would not be getting a very secure grip.  A single lag screw into a stud would have more than enough grip, but the problem there is that studs really aren't meant to bear lateral force regardless of how you tie into them. spreading the force across more than one stud would be safer, but still not as good as mounting into a joist.  If you suspend a rigid crossmember down from the ceiling -- like the cross pole in a Turtledog stand -- then you can hang your hammock from that and the pull on the joist(s) would be kept strictly vertical."

Dutchware also sells the Argon (standard Ripstop Nylon) and the PolyD (Ripstop Polyester) which are both slightly cheaper than the NylonD but also have slightly lower weight ratings.   You'll need to add a suspension system but the total will still be under $80 shipped.   EDIT- Why would you downvote this comment?

Hammocks,2xzbk0,unreplaced,2,Thu Mar 5 02:56:53 2015 UTC,"I have the vivere stand.  I find that even some of my 10' hammocks don't quite hang right on it.  The vivere fabric hammocks work well enough, as does my Yukon single/bugnet, but I find the double hammocks have me occasionally bumping the bar with the sag I prefer, and if I reduce the sag, they fall oddly on the end supports, and try to force a cocoon shape and not spread/flatten width-wise.  I would definitely recommend a longer stand for most hammocks.    I also have walls that are only vertical for 4-4.5' then angle in.  I ended up mounting to the angled part of the wall at around 5.5-6' from the floor.  It is an older house with true 2"" studs/rafters and seems to be holding up so far.  Mounts are about 16' apart, and suspension drops about 30 degrees to the ridgeline.  I've only got a few inches of clearance to the floor under load, but it is more comfortable than the stand."
Hammocks,2xzbk0,Fenrjsulfr,2,Fri Mar 6 01:28:40 2015 UTC,"I've personally gone the diy route and made a turtledog stand. It works pretty well and is flexible if you want a longer hammock. Remember that you will be laying diagonally in the hammock to be flat, so you will lose a lot of length. I'm just short of 6' and I have a double, which works nicely, but I imagine if you are any taller, you would want something a touch longer."
Hammocks,2xzbk0,justintime516,2,Thu Mar 5 18:17:12 2015 UTC,"A quick note : if you haven't yet purchased the ENO Doublenest, you might consider getting a longer one. Try hammockforums.net for advice. Also keep in mind that Dutchware will sell you a 10' hammock in polyD fabric for $33 + shipping, 11' for $35. Last I checked an ENO DN was like $70, so even if you got a full suspension from Dutch as well you'd only be a few dollars more than the ENO (and you'd have an actual high quality suspension).  As for the stands:  Both of those stands are really short. At 6'3"" I believe you'd be generally recommended at least an 11-foot hammock, which neither of these will support. I have a Byer/Amazonas Vario hammock stand, which can be adjusted from 11' up to 15'. I think those are getting harder to find, but REI and Amazon both sell what appears to be its successor, the Byer Ceara. It costs a little more than either of your linked stands, but if the build quality is anything like my Vario, it's worth it. Most importantly, it is adjustable and the minimum length will actually be comfortable for someone your height.  If you're interested in building one yourself, this Google search should get you to hammockforums.net, which has a huge variety of options. The Turtledog/Turtlelady stand is probably one of the most popular designs, but it has been a couple years since I've looked into it and I'm sure they've come up with some new stuff since then.  Edit: One other option is to hang the hammock directly on the walls. Depending on how old or shoddily made your house is, and how your room is constructed, this may be a tricky proposition; but many people have had success screwing eye bolts into studs and simply hanging a hammock off them. The huge upside to this is that you have absolutely no hardware taking up floor space when the hammock is not in use; you just push it over to one and you have the full floor space of the room available to you.  Be warned though, some people have done things like pulled walls out of alignment, torn holes in the wall or old studs, etc. So do some due diligence on the construction of the house if you're going to try this route."
Hammocks,2xzbk0,messijoez,2,Thu Mar 5 18:27:24 2015 UTC,"Hanging would actually be the easiest option, but the walls in my room go up to ~5' and then slant, so I'd probably be hitting my head at lot. Ech. The wonky ceiling also pretty much rules out a Turtledog, although I was definitely looking at that. I like building stuff but I'm not that great at it anyways.  The recommendation for the bigger one is definitely welcome, because I have a feeling you and /u/DreamHammock are probably gonna be right about the 11'. I'm still going to try the DN because I don't want to take up any more room than the bed I have now is occupying"
Hammocks,2xzbk0,messijoez,1 point,Thu Mar 5 19:31:49 2015 UTC,"5' high is plenty high enough for hammock attachments, I think.    If we think about this for a sec, I assume the ceiling slopes upward from the walls to the center, like an attic space? Assuming a 10' square room, you can put an eyebolt in two studs on a diagonal from each other and you'll have around 14' of linear hanging space. Your head and feet would be about 4' from the walls on either side assuming a centered hammock.  Now if you have a 10' square room and want to hang parallel to the walls, then your head and feet are only about 2ft from the walls, and yeah, you might run into issues. I guess it depends on how steep the angle of the ceiling is.  I have an ENO DN myself, and like it; however, similar or better quality is available from many less well known vendors at similar or much lower prices ;) Keep that in mind if you decide to upgrade later.  Any rate, good luck! Also I would trust /u/DreamHammock's advice over mine if they conflict; I believe he runs the company of the same name and is a regular over at hammockforums."

Hammocks,2xzbk0,DreamHammock,1 point,Thu Mar 5 21:40:44 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid I can't offer any information on that particular stand. At 6'3"", I believe you could be uncomfortable in such a short hammock. I would advise considering an 11ft hammock length for more comfort. An 11ft hammock will hang approx 110"" from end to end with the suggested amount of sag, so it might not fit the best on this 108"" long stand."
Hammocks,2xzbk0,DreamHammock,1 point,Thu Mar 5 04:39:01 2015 UTC,"Hm. At first I was like ""wait wut"" because obviously, 11' =/= 108"". Duh, because it's suspended, not completely flat. That's right at feet difference, which probably doesn't translate exactly into smaller sizes, but Eno's site lists the Doublenest as 9' 4"" long... so somewhere around 7ish feet? Honestly, that's actually like half a foot longer than the bed I have now.  I guess I could always try it and see. A 9' and a stand would be a little longer than my current bed but not as bulky, and I want to switch because 1) it's either this or a new mattress and I've always liked hammocks and 2) I sleep in a weird, rectangular bonus room, and I hate that the bed is just a giant block in the middle of the room.

Hammocks,2xi4b7,Osulagh,2,Sat Feb 28 22:32:40 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I have that hammock in my living room right now.  Got it when it was on Woot.com for $100.  I've slept in it a few times but you'll want a blanket large enough to wrap yourself in if you sleep in it as you can get quite chilled from the bottom."
Hammocks,2xi4b7,thepingster,1 point,Sun Mar 1 15:24:03 2015 UTC,"I have been sleeping in that hammock for 6 months now and I love it! I didn't need a blanket under me until the temperature started to drop (but I'm a pretty warm sleeper anyway). My only complaint is with the stand (I think).   It's a pretty clever design but it results in the majority of the stress being on the middle ropes. This translates to weird, taught veins running lengthwise of the hammock. Once I get into the right position, it doesn't bother me at all, but you know how you have those nights where you just can't get comfortable in your bed? Well it can happen in hammocks too, and when it does the taught veins are all I notice.   Again, I just think it's the stand. I haven't set it up on a wall or tree to see if it truly is the stand, it really doesn't bother me that much to figure it out. I would highly recommend it."
Hammocks,2xi4b7,adatema,1 point,Tue Mar 3 06:14:44 2015 UTC,I've been sleeping in it for about half a year and I love it. Cotton is for sure the way to go for indoor sleeping and it's very roomy. Just make sure you get yourself wrapped up in a comforter like a burrito in the winter or your ass is going to freeze.  Do not hang it off a door hinge. Don't install it on anything besides a stand without figuring how much strain it's going to be putting on your home or how likely it is that you're going to completely destroy the wall you hang it from. If you don't want to buy a stand look into building a turtledog stand.

Hammocks,2wzvdr,guide42,2,Tue Feb 24 16:45:19 2015 UTC,"I've made many.  I have several around the house that I've made, and I've helped our Boy Scout troop make 50 or more.  The easiest and best are made using nylon cloth, in my opinion.  You can buy quite a few different weights of cloth, everything from 1.1 oz per yard to a more standard 1.9 oz, or even a heavy weave.    My favorite so far has been a 2.3 oz calendared oxford cloth (200 denier).  It's a bit heavier, but seems to be quite sturdy and comfortable.    This is an inexpensive way to make very nice hammocks.  The nylon stretches to accommodate your pressure points, and being a cloth, the weight is supported across the entire width, which ends up being very strong.    Check out The Ultimate Hang and DIY Gear Supply for ideas on how to make your own hammocks."

I've been sleeping in one for over 3 years (actually, last night I 'shared' some floor space with a friend on sleeping pads, and had to get back In my hammock and sleep the morning away due to the crush of gravity realized by ground dwelling. Anyway, the weave of the fabric you use is highly variable - and it has a large affect on comfort. I find a taffeta weave to be ideal. It's warm, soft, and JUST enough friction to keep me from pooling in the lowest center of my hammocks.       I'd imagine that leather would be sexy, (loaded with sexy nakeds), but relatively unforgiving like a brand new Brooks saddle.     Chainmail? Interesting. I'm definitely.

I think that the materials that you wrote look really interesting. They do, however, appear to be very heavy - way more heavy than is really needed. Not to mention that a little bit of give in a hammock feels much better to use. For example, many hammocks are made from nylon. That's fine, but I prefer polyester. When you get the right weight polyester it feels way better against the skin compared to nylon. Similarly with cotton duck, it's so heavy that I don't know that it would test well with users. I spent the last year testing hammocks with different user groups, finally turning a festival crowd lose on them at a music festival. The overwhelming response was that the 100-percent polyester was much more comfortable. You can always add a double layer, too. Good luck and again it's a cool project that you undertake.

I am a side sleeper at home, but I sleep on my back in the hammock. I cannot sleep comfortably on my side in the hammock even with a pillow, but it may just be a learning curve I haven't gotten over.  Also, sitting in the hammock is so nice and comfy. You can also sit with your legs crossed and lean back as well, great for cold mornings, you can stay in your quilt and have your breakfast."

Lighter than whoopies and the anchors weigh 0.85 grand each and will attach right onto those amsteel loops.   http://www.hammockfan.com/Amsteel-Leaders-Leader-Amsteel.htm"
Hammocks,2woajw,THE_BOKEH_BLOKE,3,Sat Feb 21 19:31:02 2015 UTC,"I thought about it, but I like webbing and I don't like how speed hooks and hammock anchors create pressure spots that weaken the Amsteel leaders. Despite the need for a slipped half-hitch, I specifically used the rappelling rings over smaller and lighter cinch buckles because it's easier to thread the straps through and pull them tight."
Hammocks,2woajw,mrjowee,2,Sat Feb 21 19:44:10 2015 UTC,"I changed back to buckles as well for the same reason. It's like the Speed Hooks where just a bit too tight where they clipped to the continuous loops, and taking them off felt like they would slightly damage the rope.   I use the Warbonnet buckles. They work the same as rappelling rings, but the square shape makes them hold a little better (and a little harder to adjust as well)."

Hammocks,2whavz,guide42,10,Thu Feb 19 23:11:02 2015 UTC,i'll add that my list :)
Hammocks,2whavz,redneckgymrat,7,Thu Feb 19 23:25:48 2015 UTC,"I see 1f, 2f, and 3f icosahedral breakdowns, apparently in EMT.  Sweet.  I used to build these, full sized, as a hobby.  So much fun to do the math, and calculate the angles.  3f is just a soccer ball geometry.  I've also done alternate breakdown, as well as both octahedral and tetrahedral geometries.  You're still using the smashed ends?  Watch your lengths and angles at higher frequencies.  The stacking begins to affect overall geometry with higher numbers of joints."
Hammocks,2whavz,redneckgymrat,3,Fri Feb 20 06:41:02 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tip!  I'm working on a 4f 23ft dome right now.  And after that I'm planning on trying a 4f ~31ft.
Hammocks,2whavz,puckfirate,3,Fri Feb 20 07:30:38 2015 UTC,"Just remember, any error (even a 1/4"" variation) is multiplied across every joint, and ends up affecting fit on the far side.  At 4v you're about to notice...it's much more noticeable in the even higher frequencies.  The issue is that the joists aren't theoretical...real joists have thickness.  With an icosahedral breakdown you should never have more than six joists at any vertex.  Just, when you're assembling it, be aware that the innermost and outermost joists are, practically speaking, different lengths and attached in different places, because the thickness pushes one further out than the other.  It'll be more noticeable on the smaller dome.  You'll see what I mean."

Hammocks,2whavz,infazz,4,Thu Feb 19 23:48:58 2015 UTC,"More of a hammock limit.  No more than 2 hammocks connected to any 1 joint, and you are good.  The 17ft dome can hold 8 hammocks or so, and the 23ft dome you don't wanna do more than 20 hammocks."
Hammocks,2whavz,CatchyAxis12,2,Thu Feb 19 23:55:22 2015 UTC,What kind of engineering went into this?

Hammocks,2whavz,ShakhNar,2,Fri Feb 20 08:24:48 2015 UTC,"I guess it would be considered civil engineering. This design uses triangles (trusses) to support the load. You could solve for the load on each bar; however, that's a little more difficult than solving for loads in a 2D truss."

Gave it to my friend as a gift so she could get into hammocks. It's 48 inches wide and about 8 feet long so it's a little snug for a man but good for slim ladies. It's a perfect hammock to start modding. Suspension, ridgeline and what not. Also you can get the matching Yukon rainfly for like 30 bucks. So you can share your hobby with someone under 80 bucks.

For my tarp, I just use a bowline on one side and a reinforced taut line hitch on the other so I can slide it left and right as needed to center my tarp.

Hammocks,2w9w36,doctorfunknasty,1 point,Wed Feb 18 03:48:16 2015 UTC,"First off, $100 is not a whole lot if you're looking for a light, quality solution.  For a first timer, and attempting to get anywhere near that price range for quality/weight, I would recommend getting a Hennessy hammock. They are essentially ""all-in-one"" package hammocks that include a bug net, rain fly, and suspension, which will dramatically cut down on the total cost (as well as the amount of learning you have to do before your first trip).  The cost will vary depending on your height and personal requirements. If you are 5'8"" or below and less than 150lbs, a Hennessy Scout may suit you, and it is within your price range. Some of the Q&A at that link says it is comfortable at least up to 5'10"" and 160lbs, but I would stick with the manufacturer recommendation.  Otherwise I would try something like a Hennessy Expedition Asym, which is more suitable for larger folks.  Keep in mind, this does not include any insulation or ""bottom"" bug protection. For a budget solution, you can use an existing sleeping bag and a sleeping pad inside the hammock for under insulation.  I am guessing it won't be cold in August in Hawaii, but I bet you'll be dealing with lots of bugs, and you'll want under-insulation at the very least so they can't bite you through the bottom of the hammock. Treating the hammock body with permethrin can also help with this."
Hammocks,2w9w36,messijoez,1 point,Wed Feb 18 20:40:50 2015 UTC,"Not to hijack the thread, but I'm also a noob considering hammock camping.  I'm 6'4"" and about 260 lb.  The weight of the hammock isn't a big issue because I plan to be using it with an overland vehicle.  Would that expedition line work for a guy my size?"
Hammocks,2w9w36,SgtBrowncoat,1 point,Thu Feb 19 15:26:36 2015 UTC,"The Expedition's description there says it is for people up to 6' tall and 250lbs, so you're a little over on both counts. I would be more concerned with the length than the weight limit. You might be better served by the Hennessy Explorer, which is listed for people up to 7' tall and 300lbs.  Honestly I don't know much about Hennessy hammocks besides that they are generally well regarded and cheaper/easier for beginners to get into than a more modular setup.  If you are interested in jumping into it with both feet (and all your bank cards), I would take a look at hammockforums.net to figure out how far you want to get into hammocking, then you can start building your own stuff (diygearsupply.com, ripstopbytheroll.com), or go to some cottage makers like wildernesslogics.com, dutchwaregear.com, arrowhead-equipment.com, hammockgear.com, and any number of others for products and ideas."

I need to do an off road armored bumper and lighting first.  I thought the hammock idea would be fun and keep me off the lumpy ground and away from the assortment of creepy crawlies that come out at night in the desert.

Hammocks,2w9w36,Osulagh,1 point,Sat Feb 21 09:27:09 2015 UTC,"Hammocks cost between $20-50 cheap, but then you have to account for suspension which can be another $20-30.  Bugnets are between $40-100. Probably best to snatch up a cheapy hammock with bugnet attached like the Yukon Outfitters bugnet hammock on a Woot sale.  Rain tarps go from $30-100. The cheapest being the Yukon Outfitters tarp on a Woot sale.  So, probably best to wait for a Woot sale, and then get a woopie-sling suspension kit from a place like Dutchware.  Then, you have to factor in insulation. Anywhere under 70F and you can get rather chilly on your ass. A CCF sleeping pad will get you down to around 40-50F.   I say, you either wait for a Woot sale for Yukon outfitters (happens every month) and try to get the bugnet hammock and tarp, then get suspension from Dutchware and a cheap blue CCF pad. That will be heavier than you'd probably wish. Or, get together $200 and build a great system around a Dutchware hammock, Fronkey style bugnet and woopie-sling suspension. Get a Tadpole tarp from Wildernesslogics, and arrange any system of insulation you wish--foam pad will be cheapest, a underquilt from Arrowhead Equipment would be the cheapest to get proper bottom insulation."
Hammocks,2w7ek7,fromkentucky,14,Tue Feb 17 16:30:11 2015 UTC,"First, hammocks are one of the cheapest parts of a setup unless you go for double layer, or a high end fabric, or some fancy bug-net attached hammock.  Second, it's not the same material. There are hammocks made from silnylon, and they're stupid. Silnyon is more expensive because it's waterproof while most hammock nylon is rather cheap to make.  Third, hammocks are simple to make. They're material (you can get ripstop for $1 a yard, less if you're buying in bulk) that's been hemmed on four sides with the ends given enough room for a channel (about 15mins of time at most). That's why there's a lot of hammock companies coming out nowadays--profit margins. $50 hammock made from $0.25Xyard material and $0.10 in Chinese labor, and you can cut corners? Fuck yeah.  Tarps, on the other hand, require cutting cat curves, adding attachment points, seam sealing it, and we're not even starting on the hemming. While it took me 30 mins making my hammock, it took me nearly 5 hours making my tarp--a experienced hand would probably do it in an hour, hour and a half."
Hammocks,2w7ek7,Osulagh,3,Tue Feb 17 16:43:51 2015 UTC,Where are you getting decent hammock material for $0.25/yd?
Hammocks,2w7ek7,irishjihad,2,Tue Feb 17 20:13:40 2015 UTC,Good question. 1.6oz NylonD is $5.50/yd here.
Hammocks,2w7ek7,Osulagh,2,Tue Feb 17 20:53:21 2015 UTC,"Magna Fabrics sells ripstop for less than $1 per yard, and you can sometimes find Walmarts doing the same. Though, you don't have as wide of a selection and the specialty ripstops like diamond weaves and polyester materials.   If a company would buy direct from a maker in bulk, like let's say ENO can, the fabric will be much cheaper."

Hammocks,2w7ek7,k-level,2,Tue Feb 17 23:29:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, silnyon would suck as a hammock material. You'd wake up with a damp backside from the trapped moisture."

Hammocks,2w7ek7,Purple-Is-Delicious,2,Thu Feb 19 02:12:25 2015 UTC,"For most corporate name brands I would agree with that, barring a few exceptions for cutting-edge technology and materials.   Knowing the materials and manufacturing techniques makes it easy to pick out fairly-priced items. My ESEE 4 is probably the most expensive  piece of kit I own and I still got it secondhand.

Hammocks,2w7ek7,Deloox,1 point,Thu Feb 19 02:43:38 2015 UTC,He he that wasn't me who downvoted. But you're right a lot of the price comes from overpriced materials to begin with.  But I'm looking for an underquilt and I can't find any less than around 100$. Just kinda silly.  Or a silnylon tarp for 280$. Wtf.
Hammocks,2w7ek7,Purple-Is-Delicious,2,Thu Feb 19 20:17:26 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of silnylon tarps you can get for under $100.  As far as quilts go, good luck finding a comparable sleepingbag for less.  There's alot more than you think goes into making things like sleeping bags and underquilts.  You should try making one, or research what goes into it.  The number of hours it takes is huge, the materials like lightweight fabric and high quality down are also expensive, and if you hadn't forgotten these people are trying to make a profit."
Hammocks,2w7ek7,Deloox,1 point,Fri Feb 20 00:37:34 2015 UTC,"I know, I just find it a bit ridiculous. I mean even 100$ is expensive to me, but budget is all subjective and relative I suppose.  I doubt I could find a decent UQ and SilTarp for under 100$ anyways, so Whatevs.  There are people on the 'hammockforums' that make homemade stuff that is good quality and sell for way cheaper...  I mean most of the cost comes from the down in an uq, but for Tarps I just dont understand.  For example... I bought a surplus army bug net for 30 the other day.... but online bugnets go for 85+$? Thats crazy.  Just my 2 cents"

And make a PLUQ.  But if youwant silnylon then you've got to pay the piper, the material isnt cheap.  You can find silnylon on sale fairly often for $3-6 yd for 2nds (you'll need about 8) and then sew it up.  There are tutorials online.  You'll still end up spending about $80-$100 on materials alone."

You could probably put 400lbs of force on those quite easily depending on the setup. The tighter you have it strung, the higher the force multiplier. http://www.wilderness-survival.net/mountain-graphics/fig5-20.gif"
Hammocks,2w32t4,imcgrat2,3,Mon Feb 16 22:33:21 2015 UTC,Somewhat new guy question. Is the parachord used sufficient enough to hold equal amounts of weight? Does longer strands to cover more distance change the weight load?
Hammocks,2w32t4,lowercaselong,2,Mon Feb 16 23:37:42 2015 UTC,Yes to the first and I'm not sure on the 2nd..
Hammocks,2w32t4,imcgrat2,2,Mon Feb 16 23:40:33 2015 UTC,550 paracord is strong enough as long as it doubled up. Longer strands do not change the weight distribution. It's all about the angle of the setup. See http://theultimatehang.com/hammock-hang-calculator/ notice how the loads are magnified by changing the angle.
Hammocks,2w32t4,imcgrat2,-4,Tue Feb 17 02:00:38 2015 UTC,I would never be able to put 400lbs of force onto one of my carabiners. That's just a silly thought.

Hammocks,2w06lh,peterglass91,2,Sun Feb 15 20:56:58 2015 UTC,"I, and others, have used Silnylon from RSBR and have no problems. The strength difference between 20D and 30D is tiny, and what'll break one will probably break the other just as well.  Though, do think about getting Silpoly--I've heard good things.  I also used the DIYgearsupply hex design and used RSBR's silynlon. The thing is: No roll of silnylon is going to be larger than 60 inches, let alone 64-66 inches with seam allowance. Dunno about that measurement. Use the cutting guide on the site with any sil-material at least 58 inches wide and you'll be fine."

The business about earthquakes is that you're either standing inside a wall or you're standing under a ceiling.  There's nothing about a doorway that is structurally stronger than the rest of the wall.  You might have a pair of 2x4s above it but that's not terribly impressive when you consider they're thirty inches long and attached to studs with a couple sinkers.  Go back to the wall idea.  Make sure you're driving into the block and not the mortar.  Go to the hardware store and make site you buy the fastener they recommend and are using the correct bit for that fastener.  If the wall really won't work, build a free standing frame.  Don't mess with joists or rafters or beams, and definitely not with doors."

It would be weird for an interior wall to have cement anyway, except in a dorm or jail.  If it is plaster, you'll be able to find studs, they're just not guaranteed to be 16 on center.

Hammocks,2vxf50,Icanus,1 point,Sun Feb 15 07:18:02 2015 UTC,I still cant find any studs in it. How should I proceed?
Hammocks,2vxf50,Icanus,2,Sun Feb 15 07:19:59 2015 UTC,"Do we agree it's a plaster wall?  Because the likelihood of it being cinder block is really low.  First, all blocks are cheap which is why it's what cheap ugly buildings are made out of.  Second, even deteriorating sub level retaining walls would be too hard to get a nail into.  Third, a standard block is 8"" thick which is massive for an interior wall which are usually 4"".  Your doorway should make it obvious.  So, if it is a plaster wall, what you have is probably irregular studs (16"" on center is standard now, these might be every two feet or so).  They hold the wall up and you can't build a ceiling without them, so they're there. Running horizontally are thin, 1-2"" strips of wood lathe. The plaster (which can be very grainy, like cement) is trowelled over them and then it's painted.  So.  A cheap stud sensor is going to detect the wood all throughout the wall because there aren't obvious hollow spots like on a sheet rock wall.  You'll need one that's better than the cheap ones.  Like a $20 one.  If you have a good sensor and you still can't find a stud, you're using it wrong or you don't have a good enough sensor.    Finally, if it's a block wall and the concrete is crumbling, move out.  If you can't, buy some carriage bolts, wing nuts, and some dimensional lumber and make a rack to hang the hammock in."

If you're concerned, get two five or six inch pieces of 1-inch pressure rated pvc pipe and use them as very small spreader bars.

The XLC is even better, you can remove the net entirely when you don't need it. The catch is that it is a bit pricey."

Hammocks,2vurft,hammyhammock,1 point,Sat Feb 14 07:12:04 2015 UTC,"I slept on a Vivere hammock using their stand for a few months.  I still use the hammock, but have it hanging from the walls now.  Although the stand worked well enough for me to sleep on with the Vivere hammock, when I tried switching to a Yukon double, the stretchier fabric, and the amount of sag I wanted caused me to bump against the long base bar as I changed position, so I mounted hooks in the wall.  I have returned to using the Vivere hammock, but I use the wall mounts, since they are there.  I would not be opposed to using the stand again if I wanted to set up the hammock somewhere else.    I would like to try a longer hammock soon, which would not be advantaged by the stand.  Personally I would prefer a taller stand.  It works well for the Vivere hammock, but gathered end hammocks I've tried sag to the bar/ground unless I pull the gathered knot outside of the stand, which seems to rather negatively affect the hang, not allowing it to open fully/uneven tension across the bed.    I don't think I quite have the diagonal positioning down yet.  I can get flat on the diagonal, but only in one direction.  The other direction doesn't even come close to being flat/comfortable.  I've experienced this in all of my hammocks, using multiple suspension methods.  I also cannot sleep in the flat, comfortable position.  In fact, I have never fallen asleep lying on my back in a hammock.  I can in chairs, beds, and on floors, but I always sleep on my side in a hammock, though it is much less comfortable.  5'10"" 170lbs."

I spent a fair while doing that myself, and have gone down around freezing with a sleeping pad and a layer of Reflectix insulation and a standard sleeping bag. The underquilt is so worth the money when you can spend it, though.  As for when you need something under you, that's going to depend on how warm you sleep mostly. For me, I start liking to have something under me when the nighttime lows go down into the low 60s or below.

Hammocks,2vgf4s,BraveSaintStuart,1 point,Wed Feb 18 15:18:27 2015 UTC,"Same here.   Having no insulation underneath you can be cold at 60 degrees if there is any kind of breeze.  Sleeping pads can work, and I've used them many time, but an underquilt is just so much better.  My first underquilt was and old sleeping bag opened up all the way and held in place with paper clamps. It worked great once I had a system, but I eventually attached bungees on the corners.  I later went with a real underquilt t save weight and packing space."

Some times I just slept on top of it, sometimes inside. But stayed fairly warm. Would an under quilt negate the need for a sleeping bag? I under stand that a sleeping bag might not be as effective. But I'm really trying to save money at the moment.  Does any one know how I can temporarily rig a sleeping bag as an under - quilt for a night?"
Hammocks,2vgf4s,Bortlekombat904,1 point,Wed Feb 11 04:18:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can run para cord in a continuous loop from one carabiner that your hammock attaches to the suspension with, through the other carabiner and back around the original one. Now, fully unzip your sleeping bag, put it under your hammock and fold the excess on the top over the para cord and then back between the outside of the hammock and the inside of your under quilt (sleeping bag). Basically you are using the para cord to hold up the bag and to have something for the bag to fold over."

Hammocks,2ve6s8,CedarWolf,7,Tue Feb 10 06:39:55 2015 UTC,"ENO products are, as a rule, over priced. The ENO Super Fly with poles is listed as 7.25 pounds on their website. As a comparison, for  half the price you can get a 19oz Warbonnet Super Fly (same name, totally different product).  The poles with the ENO tarp aren't made to support a hammock, and I think that tarp isn't designed for one (they call it a ""utility tarp"" on their website). What you want are these: http://www.handyhammock.co.uk"
Hammocks,2ve6s8,mrjowee,1 point,Tue Feb 10 13:45:10 2015 UTC,"Hmmmm, just the poles and suspension system without the hammock is $150 USD. Well, I've got a little time, I'll try the metal water pipe first. Or I could save up for a bit."
Hammocks,2ve6s8,jmstallard,2,Tue Feb 10 14:58:41 2015 UTC,"You could get 3/8"" awning corners and 3/8"" fence top rail and make a more stable, lower-profile version of a Turtledog stand. See THIS and THIS. A large surplus duffle bag will hold the whole thing easily, though the pieces will stick out the top."
Hammocks,2ve6s8,DeepGreen,3,Thu Feb 12 12:59:48 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I don't own a hammock, but I used to work in event hire and have put up literally tens of thousands of square metres of canvas.  Your question is one I have been thinking about of late. The solution I have so far involves two or four poles, line and stakes.   Using lashing (consult your scout handbook), lash together two pieces of water pipe to form an A frame. Place the A frame and tie a longer line (3 m or so) from the peak of this one to another. Tie out both A frames to pegs.   You are going to need heavy pegs because these are holding your weight, not the weight of a gossamer tarp. I suggest six millimeter nylon rope."
Hammocks,2ve6s8,messijoez,2,Tue Feb 10 09:19:10 2015 UTC,"Would I be able to get away with using some regular plumbing pipe, or do I need to find something more flexible?"
Hammocks,2ve6s8,DeepGreen,3,Tue Feb 10 09:21:00 2015 UTC,"/u/DeepGreen 's solution is not going to work, at least not unless you have very serious ""pegs"" or some kind of very secure anchor to hold the A frames in place.  The reason being that the most force on a hammock support is exerted inwards, towards the center of the hammock. The A-frames only need to bear the weight of your body, which is typically a much smaller force.  /u/DeepGreen 's solution will basically hold the hammock fine, but unless you've anchored the A-frames with sunken posts or some very serious anchors, the whole thing will pull free of the restraining ropes and collapse inwards on you when you get into the hammock.  Look at /u/yourenotmydad 's link below... this is what you're looking for.  Notice that the classic ""turtlelady"" stand uses bamboo poles for the tripods at the head and the foot, but a sturdy metal pipe for the top rail. This should give you some idea as to the relative forces involved."
Hammocks,2ve6s8,messijoez,2,Wed Feb 11 02:40:44 2015 UTC,"That example uses compression architecture rather than tension architecture to achieve the same end.   In your experience, mate, how many tons do you think you can hang off an 8mm rope and a foot long star picket?  I admit a star picket is probably overkill, but some angle iron stakes or some made from rebar would do fine and would not take a sledge hammer to drive them in,  a lump hammer would do. Either would be lighter than nine feet or more of iron pipe.  As for the A frame  slipping, don't worry about it. All the forces pull it into the ground or are balanced by counterparts giving a net vector of zero. If you are truly concerned, dig a hole to put the feet in.   Just because the other solution relies on compression rather than tension does in no way make it superior. Just harder to carry."
Hammocks,2ve6s8,DeepGreen,2,Wed Feb 11 03:09:25 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, you are absolutely right. I was thinking of more lightweight camping style hardware, which I would be very careful of holding in soft ground against, e.g., a heavyset guy moving around in a hammock.  Given the right hardware and installation tension setups would certainly work, I just think it takes a little more knowledge to diy one properly than a compression setup."
Hammocks,2ve6s8,DeepGreen,2,Wed Feb 11 05:21:10 2015 UTC,"I agree. The tripod and bar set up linked is faster to put up and take down. It also needs no knots or ropes.  It does weigh more and take up more space, but would be easy to move twice a day, if you wanted that. It also works just as well inside as outside.   I am comfortable with knots though.  A rolling hitch, boline and trucking are easy enough to learn. Six millimeter rope is a nice size to tie and untie."

Hammocks,2ve6s8,yourenotmydad,1 point,Tue Feb 17 04:23:24 2015 UTC,"You can pack up with the lashing in place, just move the poles together to fold up the A frame.   An alternative is to use one A frame and tie the other end onto the roof rack of your car."

Hammocks,2vdyfj,steveflinn,2,Wed Feb 11 09:09:55 2015 UTC,I actually prefer them to the cinch buckles I've been using.

Hammocks,2vc2t0,TinyGymMouse,3,Tue Feb 10 13:52:34 2015 UTC,"I know as well from the Army that a pack weight of 90lbs. will wreck you're body. TA-50 shit is alway's SUPEER heavy-duty and as a result SUPER HEAVY.   I have this argument all the time with my athletic buddies. They alway's want to soldier up and carry everything regardless of the weight. The result of this is: A. They'll never keep up with me on the trail (I'm carrying 25lbs....) B. At the end of the day they'll be exhausted, joint pains, muscle fatigue, etc.  So it comes down to this- Are you going out in the wilderness to challenge yourself physically or mentally? And more importantly, are you looking to have a fun, comfortable time, or are you trying to go commando?  I choose the former which is why I started studying and learning unique skill sets that would serve me well in the field. As well as an extensive knowledge of gear and going lighter. With my 25lb. pack, I guarantee you I will accomplish everything at camp that you are capable of and probably a whole lot more. On top of that, when I hike, I feel nothing. I'm free to run the wilderness with the confidence of a light, simple pack. It's been glorious. I encourage you to downsize equipment weight. You'll have a way better time."

Hammocks,2vc2t0,Vaughnatri,2,Mon Feb 9 23:09:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah man the trick for trekking is shaving the unnecessary ounces. The pounds will come off if you stick to your bare minimum gear needs and on top of that, watch the weight of even those items. Badass little stove you've got there =) I've learned for a night or two, it's so. damn. easy. to think ""sure, two knives are necessary. Hell, ill bring two flashlights just in case. Soap? Ill bring this giant bottle of dish soap even though i will probably use 2-3 drops max. I only NEED one pan to cook on and one water boiler, but ill just bring my extras just in case."" Etc. I have a terrible habit of overpacking for short trips. Ideally, you can get away with the same amount of minimal gear for a week long trek as you can for a 2 night gig. The only changes would be extra underwear, socks, water, and food. You're one tough bastard to tote around 90lbs for 24 hours lol. do your knees and back a favor and shave that down to about 45 pounds. You will be undoubtedly just as comfortable in your camp because A) you're not dead on arrival and B) you've got just everything you need, nothing more, nothing less. Also, calculate your water needs. You should drink about 1 liter per 2-4 hrs on the trail (depending on heat and terrain of course. 1liter/hr if you're sweating like a madman) anything more will just be peed out quickly because of activity's Fx on bladder motility. Always make sure you leave enough to cook with if needed (white rice and some pre-packagex salmon are a godsend dinner on the trail) Just suggestions so don't take this as a scolding lecture. I don't want you to wreck your knees unnecessarily! It's one thing when in combat and 90lbs of gear can be the difference between life or death. On a leisure trip, falling just shy of a hundred pounds is a heavy burden and in some cases can freeze any leisurely benefits dead in their tracks. Happy hiking =)"

Canvas, cotton rope, or any other natural product will begin to rot with the humidity and microbes that will be present outside.  UV light will degrade most synthetics, so be sure that the hammock body stays shaded from direct sunlight.  Just about any of the nylon based commercial hammocks will work fine, as well any of the string hammocks that are made with nylon, polyester or other synthetic strings.  For full time living, a fabric style hammock will offer more protection against flying insects than a rope style (or string style) hammock will, unless the hammock is hung inside a bug net."

You'll also need a tarp, underquilt and topquilt if you're planning to be outside in anything below 70 degrees or so.  Make your way over to Hammock Froums to get all your basic questions answered.  The tarp on a lot of the Hennessys is integral to the suspension, so when you climb into the hammock, it sags.  A tarp should be supported separately.  The tarp is what keeps you dry."

Hammocks,2v2uov,IANALAMA,0,Sat Feb 7 14:23:15 2015 UTC,"OP's concerned about the length of the tablecloth, though, which is a little on the short side. But I agree with you that trying to extend the ends with lines is going to be more trouble than it's worth. I'd either live with the length as it is, or just get a new longer tablecloth -- TableclothsFactory.com has reasonably cheap 10.5'x5' tablecloths that are what a lot of folks use.  OP, if you're bound and determined to try to extend the one you've got, I'm not sure I would trust just straight grommets in the fabric. I'd probably at least want to double the fabric over first, and maybe even run a length of webbing inside the fold to reinforce. It would really depend on how many lines you were going to put in and how robust your fabric is, I suppose.  Really, though, that's going to be a lot more hassle and possibly more expensive than just buying a new longer tablecloth. Heck, it might not even be worth it compared to waiting for another Woot deal on the Yukon Outfitter Double, or for just a little bit more going with one of Dutch's premade hammock bodies (Argon, PolyD, or NylonD), which are quite good and ready for you to just add your suspension."

Just gotta be careful getting in and out, and don't swing too much, 'cause the whole thing can still tip over.  The downside to ski poles is you hang really close to the ground.  The longer the poles, the higher off the ground you'll be.  Once I used a pair of oak jo staves ('basically a 1"" oak dowel that's about 5' or 6' long) in my back yard and they did the job well, too.  But, that would not be very lightweight if I wanted to take it backpacking.  Any pair of long walking sticks/staffs should work just fine, the obvious trade off is weight."

Hammocks,2uzk6j,Lumpensamler,1 point,Sun Feb 8 17:10:31 2015 UTC,"I personally have hiked with a 6' tall bamboo pole.  It's very lightweight and strong.  I cut a new one every 3 to 5 years, as needed.  I go to the local hardware store (or pharmacy) and buy a rubber cap for the bottom of it, like the ones that go on the bottom of a crutch.  It makes the bottom very durable.  This serves as a ""second tree"" for my one-tree hang.  Of course, this doesn't help if you can't find any point to hang at least one side of your hammock, but I've been able to find at least one side of the hammock pretty much anywhere I've ever gone.  I've also thought many times about making my own Handy Hammock struts.  I can think of quite a few ways to make one that would be very inexpensive.  The first thought that comes to mind is to use a 3/4 piece of schedule 40 PVC as the upright, and very cheap wal-mart aluminum arrow shaft sections as the supporting struts.  I'd use something light and strong, like Zing-It, for the strut support lines, and 7/64"" Amsteel for the structural suspension lines.   EDIT  I got curious after writing this, and looked for the strongest thing I could find.  I found 6' tall carbon-fibre tubes for sale for under $50.

My only quality complaint is that I ripped the seam stitching on the stuff sack a bit after I swapped out the tiny, heavy, steel carabiners for lighter, and larger, aluminum climbing carabiners. To fix this, I removed the 3/8"" ropes and carabiners entirely, and installed cinch buckles on 8"" Amsteel continuous loops to work with my 1"" webbing strap suspension. Much less bulk to stuff in the bag now and I lost several ounces of weight too.   The hammock material itself is good quality with triple-stitched seams.   It's a great beginner hammock but I'll likely be getting an 11' Dutchware NylonD soon, as this one is too short for a full night's sleep. I'm 5'-7"".

Even for more than 20 bucks, that kind of durability would be a great deal.

THIS IS A COMMON QUESTION AND NEWCOMERS NEED TO SEE THE CRITICISMS OF EAGLES NEST OUTFITTERS AS WELL AS THE ALTERNATIVE SUGGESTIONS.  To begin, ENO hammocks are way overpriced considering they don't include a suspension system, storage pockets, peak bag, bug net, ridgeline or guyline hooks. Those are all common features on other hammocks in that price range.  For comparison, an 11 foot long Dutchware NylonD hammock is $37, uses better quality material, same triple-stitched seams, weighs half as much and will be much more comfortable due to the length.  Yukon Outfitters also sells quality hammocks at much better prices, including some with mosquito nets.  Occasionally the Yukon hammocks go on sale at Woot.com for even less.   Arrowhead Equipment sells a complete Whoopie Sling Suspension Kit for ~$30 shipped.  I've been using a Cinch Buckle and Webbing suspension, and I love it, but it's ~1/4lb heavier than a Whoopie Sling setup."

Conservation is an ethic of resource use, allocation, and protection. [emphasis mine]   For example: the population of the North American Beaver needs to be controlled by trappers or they would cause huge damage to their local ecosystems.  By being totally anti-fur, the demand for beaver pelts have fallen, disincentivising trappers from trapping and helping to control their numbers.  In the Northeast U.S., it's easy to find entire swaths of felled trees where beaver live, causing injury to the lake ecosystem and the surrounding populations of birds, squirrels, owls, and various other fauna.  Additionally, overbuilding of beaver dams can cause stream blockage (and flooding), which can negatively effect every ecosystem downstream.  They're a very important part of the ecosystem, but controlling the population is not the same as eradication.  The same likely probably goes for coyotes in some places - please educate yourself on specific issues instead of being guided by dogma.   You may feel that killing animals is morally wrong, but controlling populations of certain animals can help save the lives and homes of many others."

Coyotes in excessive numbers present a risk to many who would have outdoor pets, raise chickens, have herd animals who have recently given birth, or small children who just don't know any better. This is why the population is monitored and seasonality on killing/culling the animal is lengthened, opened, shortened or just plain removed based on the amount of life or economic risk that said population presents.    Take the wild boars in Texas and northern Mexico right now, these animals can literally destroy an acre in a few hours because their numbers were allowed to exceed what a natural environment would produce."

Hammocks,2upovc,rmull,1 point,Wed Feb 4 17:49:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can buy tree straps from the usual hammock manufacturers, though it's a fairly easy DIY too. I use 1"" polyester webbing with a sewn loop in one end - I bought a ""simple sling"" from strapworks.com and cut it in half, leaving me with two straps with one free end and one loop end each. I wrap the strap around the tree and thread the loose end through the loop and pull tight, then use a marlinspike hitch with a toggle to hook my hammock onto it.  The straps you might buy from a hammock company may use different ways of attaching a hammock - there are many different strategies. Just make sure the material is correct - nylon will stretch and sag, polyester will not."

Attach the hammock with the split chain links or latching carabiners of some kind. Make sure only one end of the clip goes in the eye bolt because the steel will deform a bit and mangle your fiber robes if the clip gets switched around.

Hammocks,2ukzq2,JohnSpartans,2,Tue Feb 3 19:49:43 2015 UTC,"Pole length varies based on the dome.  The 2-person dome poles are 5.3ft long - though I've been thinking about making them slightly larger to give more hang room.    For weight on the 2-person ones, it will be able to hold anything the hammock is rated for.  I've had 2 people in each hammock, no problems.  No case for these yet - I usually bundle the poles together with straps.  I'd say the 2-person dome weighs around 50-60 lbs.  I can carry it around by myself."

There are fixed stands and portable stands.  Some hammock stands need to be staked out, depending on the stakes to provide enough horizontal strength to keep the stand up, where other stands (like the Turtledog stand) have horizontal poles that work on compression to keep the ends of the hammock apart."
Hammocks,2ukzq2,fanelli,3,Tue Feb 3 13:28:17 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I doubt you'll find anything as simple as poles. A hammock exerts a lot of lateral force on the attachment points. Can go north of 400lbs of force for your average person depending on the hammock setup.   I'd look into geodesic domes. They're really easy to build from scratch (especially as a practical engineering / mathematics / physics project) and pretty cheap even if you were to buy one. Bonus, you can have a bunch of people hanging from one of them.   https://www.hammockforums.net/gallery/files/1/2/8/7/7/dscf5824.jpg  There are also various hammock stands out there.

Later I added a compression pole, which helped slightly. I would never want 2 people in that setup. I would be scared something would shatter/come down.  Last year or so, I've used the boy scout setup. I got the idea from the turtledog stand, only I wanted to not use any hardware. Boy Scout Frame . I just bought 7 poles, and some rope. Done and the most stable stand I've built yet(v3). No creaks and two person stable. I added the cane bottoms when I moved to an all wood floor apartment."

Hammocks,2ufhub,itshotintopeka,2,Sun Feb 1 23:34:22 2015 UTC,"It's three pieces. Two sets of hardware store 10 foot poles(first version used 6 foot poles, use ten if you have space) lashed together with a tripod lashing.  Then a long fixed loop going around the lashing in a cow hitch. This hangs a loop straight down the center of the tripod and locks the tripod lashing in place. I can do pull ups on this, and no wobble. I weigh 250 lbs.  Now the long cross piece sets on these loops and the hammock lashes onto this pole. It's important to have the hammock attachments and the vertical loops lined up. They cancel each other out, and the whole setup won't wobble if you get it right.  I really should've just made a picture, would've been easier than typing that."

I weigh 250lbs and have never had a problem, aside from some slight creaking in my old house that was 140 years old.  If you want, you can add a couple of 2x4s between the studs for added support, but I've never needed to.  This takes care of my sleeping.

""Frolicking"" is difficult in a hammock in the standard ways.  My walls hold my girlfriend and I fine (total of 375lbs) and the extra movement doesn't phase the studs.  Its possible, but requires a lot of playful exploration.  Trust your hammock.  That said, have at least a foam mat to lay under your hammock for ""frolicking"" and those random nights you just feel like sprawling out on a flat surface.  Plus, if your hammock were to break, it makes a soft landing.  I can't stand sleeping in a bed anymore and I made a microfiber insert in my hammock to wrap myself in a warm fuzzy cocoon in winter.  I wouldn't mess with the stands because they always take space; use a metal carabiner (sp?  The rock climbing clips) in the eye bolt and it folds away neatly for extra space.  If you MUST use a stand, just cut some 4x4s in a 45 degree angle and attach them to a 2x6, braced with another 4x4.  Place two 2x4s under it for the legs and screw it all together.  I did this and made the hammock double as a couch for the 6mo I lived in an apartment."
Hammocks,2uek2j,Christof3,14,Sun Feb 1 13:09:38 2015 UTC,"Then buy elsewhere. List prices on items (NOT from Amazon) range into the absurd. They have an e-bay like marketplace for you and me to list too. That's not an Amazon listing, it's an Amazon hosted listing."
Hammocks,2uek2j,Rockshurtmyhead,2,Sun Feb 1 14:09:29 2015 UTC,How do you sort out the hosted listings from the actual Amazon listings?
Hammocks,2uek2j,Rockshurtmyhead,8,Sun Feb 1 15:16:03 2015 UTC,"First, Prime Eligible, Prime is only from Amazon.  Second, new offers only, Amazon farms out their used/open box to 'children' companies like Woot.com clearance events  Third, when looking at an item, see the fulfillment and availability sections.   Fulfillment by Amazon means a seller sent them a pallet, Amazon ships it out to you.   Available from other sellers (Or when a specific seller is listed) those options are from the e-bay-ish side of the house.  https://i.imgur.com/tCVIxL3.png"
Hammocks,2uek2j,RoboNinjaPirate,1 point,Sun Feb 1 15:25:16 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for the information!"
Hammocks,2uek2j,Rockshurtmyhead,-1,Sun Feb 1 15:26:49 2015 UTC,Nope - Prime is also for things fulfilled by amazon. I can overprice something and have Amazon do fulfillment for me and they cover prime.
Hammocks,2uek2j,OhHappyDagger,1 point,Sun Feb 1 20:53:37 2015 UTC,"Prime can also apply to things fulfilled by amazon, but is primarily for Amazon-set pricing on items. Not the other way round."
Hammocks,2uek2j,Rockshurtmyhead,0,Sun Feb 1 21:19:47 2015 UTC,"Prime does not equal Amazon set price, at all. If I have a product fulfilled by Amazon, it will have Prime, and I can set any price I want."
Hammocks,2uek2j,Charlemagne712,1 point,Wed Feb 18 05:16:18 2015 UTC,"And it will never get bought, because their price shows up first. And you shit doesn't come in a prime box, it's not prime when you send it."
Hammocks,2uek2j,Barnacle-bill,3,Wed Feb 18 13:53:26 2015 UTC,"Look up prime eligible. Usually a little more expensive than the actual retail, but it's consistent and you get free shipping with prime."
Hammocks,2uek2j,IANALAMA,0,Sun Feb 1 15:24:57 2015 UTC,"By using a little common sense. Unfortunately I wasn't able to find a way to sort items sold and shipped solely by Amazon. If the prices are crazy then it's likely sold and shipped by a third party. Nothing to not trust about amazon. If you know how to shop the site you won't get screwed. No one is making you purchase overpriced items. And most retailers aren't trying to screw you via Amazon either, there's definitely a few bad eggs though.  If you click an item, you can see who is selling it and where it's going to be shipped from. In this instance, the item is both sold and shipped by Amazon. This information is located right under the price of the item where the In Stock/Out of Stock information is listed."
Hammocks,2uek2j,IANALAMA,-5,Sun Feb 1 15:28:19 2015 UTC,The site by its nature allows price gouging. That for me is reason enough not to trust them. I'll just shop elsewhere from now on. It doesn't seem to be as much of an issue on the US site though so at least my neighbors to the south can still find deals.
Hammocks,2uek2j,Jrose152,4,Sun Feb 1 16:13:50 2015 UTC,"I spent the greater part of a day shopping and comparing hammock tarps, created a spreadsheet and ended up coming across this, might be a bit outdated in some, but most of the vendors and sizes/weights are correct. Finding non-eno alternatives will save you some money (overpriced for the quality), but also save you some weight as well."
Hammocks,2uek2j,redfiftyfive,2,Sun Feb 1 17:59:03 2015 UTC,"That is a kickass list. I mean seriously hefty. I'm pretty good with the setup i've got, but a friend is just getting into it and is looking for ideas so I'm definitely going to pass this along. I think you just saved him a LOT of time and effort, so thanks for that."
Hammocks,2uek2j,Osulagh,2,Sun Feb 1 18:36:00 2015 UTC,"Source with discussion. I'm planning on taking my new spreadsheet and merging with that list, but my columns are much more detailed and i'm using filtering for helping compare based on various categories, like price, weight, measurements, etc."
Hammocks,2udea2,CarbyCarberson,2,Sun Feb 1 03:12:54 2015 UTC,Saw a great deal on Craigslist the other day for a Hennessy Explorer.  Seller disclosed that the loop was missing.  It was such a good deal that I snatched it up hoping someone could recommend a good repair method.
Hammocks,2udea2,Beeip,2,Sun Feb 1 03:15:29 2015 UTC,"Not familiar with the Explorer... Is this tie-out simply for stability/less sway? Did the loop itself tear, or did it rip nylon, too? Sorry, didn't see your album. You've still got the backside loop. Just tie off with the remaining loop and enjoy simpler ingress/egress!  Honestly, find someone with a sewing machine, if you must fix it, but I can't imagine it interferes much with the quality of your hang!"
Hammocks,2udea2,soulsizzle,3,Sun Feb 1 03:33:43 2015 UTC,These tieouts are mostly for spreading the hammock fabric out. They make the hammock more roomy and less cocoon like. It's a nice feature but certainly not critical.
Hammocks,2udea2,Osulagh,1 point,Sun Feb 1 05:11:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely familiar with HH, so I can only go off from what I've seen in the picture.   Looks like the cloth loop was ripped out and left the stitching intact.  A few inches of grossgrain and a D-ring would replace it no problem (DIYGearSupply will probably be the cheapest place to order this from). You'd simply assemble it the other side with the grossgrain and D-ring, and sew it to the body. You can do this by hand easily because it's small. Do put in quite a lot of passes so the loop doesn't rip out."
Hammocks,2udea2,Rockshurtmyhead,2,Sun Feb 1 03:57:18 2015 UTC,"Wow that site is amazing.  Time to learn how to sew, I guess."
Hammocks,2udea2,HobbitLass,1 point,Sun Feb 1 04:21:58 2015 UTC,Sew what? It's a super good skill to have if you're going to maintain your gear. I think every adult ought to know how to do basic hand/machine sewing!
Hammocks,2udea2,Osulagh,3,Sun Feb 1 15:35:44 2015 UTC,"Professional seamstress here. I wouldn't use grosgrain. It tears and shreds pretty easily! I would get some nylon straping. It's sold in the  trim section at fabric stores. Heres a link for a really good looking one. I'd venture to say the lightweight would work just fine. Also, this site sells the more narrow kind, which you won't see in a run of the mill fabric store. But it allows you to make sure it fits the ring that you use!"
Hammocks,2udea2,HobbitLass,2,Sun Feb 1 07:36:46 2015 UTC,Grossgrain is going to be better than the hemmed piece of ripstop Hennessy Hammock put on the hammock originally. It's good for tie-outs like this--especially since it won't hold structural weight. Webbing will be overkill.
Hammocks,2udea2,U235EU,2,Sun Feb 1 08:32:07 2015 UTC,I suppose...  But i dont see the downside to something being more sturdy. It's also really cheap.
Hammocks,2udea2,WiseGuy1020,1 point,Sun Feb 1 16:58:07 2015 UTC,"You could hand stitch it since this is not a load bearing part of the hammock. Pick up a few large sewing needles and use dental floss for thread. I've made hand repairs using dental floss to several pieces of my gear, it works really well."

Hammocks,2udoei,fromkentucky,2,Sun Feb 1 06:32:43 2015 UTC,"I just read your comment and it made me think to when I used to not use a tarp when I hammock camped. It's not a long or crazy story but it's info non the less.   My buddies and I would often camp care free on nights with no rain without a tarp of any kind above. I went out and purchased a cheap tarp just to extend my camping a bit more. The first morning after my first camp session with a tarp I woke up to something kind of gross on top of my tarp...Bat poop. Bat poop frekin everywhere and mainly around my head area. Ever since then, if I am spending overnight in a hammock, I put a tarp above me.  No one wants to get pooped on..."

Hammocks,2ub2oo,MachinatioVitae,1 point,Sat Jan 31 17:44:01 2015 UTC,How does this help with trees being too close together? (Genuinely curious)
Hammocks,2ub2oo,PootyJuice,0,Sun Feb 1 10:30:01 2015 UTC,no you still need a set distance. the size of the hammock and a few inches on each side to account for tree straps and carabiner from the hammock.
Hammocks,2ub2oo,PootyJuice,1 point,Mon Feb 2 15:49:39 2015 UTC,Whoopies are actually at a disadvantage compared to some suspension systems because they actually require more room (a lot of the length is fixed due to the bury section).
Hammocks,2uax4a,gabek333,1 point,Sat Jan 31 13:33:55 2015 UTC,"Make your own. I don't know what materials you can acquire, like ripstop or perhaps tablecloths, but making your own hammock is fairly straight forward. A length of cloth like 120 inches long, 56+ inches wide, tied at two ends and strung up with 30 degree angles in the suspension."
Hammocks,2uax4a,Osulagh,1 point,Sat Jan 31 22:30:22 2015 UTC,From what I understand hammocks are extremely common in Chili. And they are cheaper than making one yourself.  They usually aren't designed for backpacking so the suspension is going to be on the heavy side.  You may want to bring your own Whoopie suspension if your concerned about weight.

I've also strapped it on lower and then just pushed it up with a couple of sticks haha.   To get into it though you can definitely climb up the lower hammocks like a ladder, that works pretty well. The little hop to get in is a little scary but you get used to it. It's really fun and i definitely say try it!"

Hammocks,2uarmw,suffer-cait,1 point,Sat Jan 31 12:03:45 2015 UTC,"Any two sticks can be used to hold up the tarp high enough to provide a rain-fly for ""on the ground"" sleeping.  If you can clear off enough sticks and rocks, the bottom of the hammock will work as ""ground cover and a bug net.  You should have some sort of sleeping pad.  If you don't have a sleeping pad or a ground cloth, you can use piles of leaves, pine needles, or other soft vegetation found around you to insulate you from the ground.  This is needed, since the ground will try to rob you of body heat, just like any tent sleeping would.  I've often slept out with nothing but a tarp over me and a sleeping pad under me.  Having the HH as a bug net would provide insect protection. Don't think of it as a bivy, because the hammock is not waterproof, and that's really what a bivouac does for you. Think of it instead as a fairly compete tarp shelter."

Hammocks,2u9uta,Thepher,4,Sat Jan 31 10:36:50 2015 UTC,"Your question confused me at first - how can you be in danger when you are alone. Frankly, most solo campers get a case of the jitters, but there's nothing out there that's going to get you - unless you live in an area with big critters. If it's humans you are worried about, don't be - in my experience, once the sun has gone down, you've seen your last dog walker or hiker and you are all alone for the night. It's awesome.  Any time I get a little spooked at the chatter in my imagination I just bust out the headtorch and walk around the area a little - it's a little Blair Witch for all of three seconds until you realise that nobody is there and you have this awesome, wild expanse all to yourself, and you've made a wonderful little nest right in the middle of it.  Personally, I wouldn't like having an enclosed hammock so much, so it may be worth switching over to an open design, but other than that, just trust that people are not skulking around in the woods at night - not without a fair amount of noise and light to give you advanced warning at least, and it's never happened once in my many solo trips. Also, having a nice shank makes you feel good, and is practical too. A Mora Companion is a great outdoor knife, and can be drawn in less than a second, as my co-workers were surprised to discover today."

Hammocks,2u9uta,rusty075,7,Sat Jan 31 20:21:38 2015 UTC,"You're really no more vulnerable than you are in a tent on the ground.  The hypothetical boogieman has no idea if it's a woman in that hammock or a giant meathead of a dude.  (unless he watches you while you're outside of the shelter, but in that case no amount of ripstop nylon is going to make a difference)  It's a fear of the unknown thing.  It's an irrational fear of the unknown, just like you were scared the first time you camped in the woods alone, or drove a car alone, or your first day of school.  The reality is that you're way more likely to have something bad happen to you tonight wherever you are sleeping indoors, than you are while camping in the woods, regardless of what sort of shelter you have.  ...of course knowing it's irrational and convincing your brain that the leaves you just heard rustling outside your hammock was just the wind and not Sasquatch is a whole 'nother thing.  I can't help you there."
Hammocks,2u9uta,Deloox,2,Sat Jan 31 05:20:39 2015 UTC,"Bring some pepper spray and if you're really worried get a tazer.   It is a bit of the 'fear of the unknown' thing, but it is true that there are sickies out there.  Having a defense plan might make you feel better."

Hammocks,2u9uta,snruff,2,Thu Feb 12 03:20:39 2015 UTC,"I get it. As most everyone has said and I'm sure you know, it's the fear that gets you most. I found the best way to get over these little (or large) fears was to take them out of the equation. One of the biggest problems I had was those noises all night long. Leaves in the breeze turn into Jason from Friday. First thing I did was take an ipod and listen to podcasts until I fell asleep (I suggest something amusing, like ricky Gervaise or rooster teeth. The lighter the listening, the lighter the mood) After a few trips I started to enjoy the sounds of the Bush (I live in australia... we get bush. Forests are for lucky people :D) Personal safety is a tough one. Everyone here is correct in saying that you are in more danger in your own home than in the wild. I always have a carpenter's hatchet in my pack wich I hang at arms reach underneath my hammock. I keep a small (super scary sharp) folder in my pocket from the moment I leave home until I return and I hang my esee 5 on my ridge line. None of these really make you any safer but they sure make you feel it. If pepper spray is legal where you are, sure, but be aware if you are under a tarp when you spray, you are both gonna get a dose and also mind the fickle winds of the forest. A super bright flashlight in the eyes will blind someone in the middle of the night just as well.   Any of these things and more will make you feel better but also be careful in preparing, that you don't start over thinking why you are taking this stuff. You may end up freaking yourself out more than before you started prepping.  TL;DR, listen to music or podcasts at night to get rid of the boogeyman. Keep a knife or solid flashlight with you. Remember to love it because hammock camping is a gift from the gods and worth doing alone or with others. Get out there and let us know how you went. It's a blast."
Hammocks,2u9uta,allthetoes,2,Sat Jan 31 20:40:05 2015 UTC,"I find the advice you've gotten a bit disingenuous and shabby.   You may well have ptsd. You may certainly be a bit more anxious than 'normal'  because of it. But being anxious about camping alone is absolutely normal. And, while it may not be substantially different, sleeping in a hammock is psychologically different from sleeping in an enclosure, both for the camper and a random passer-by. A tent may not be sturdy, but it communicates privacy to people used to living in enclosures. So don't feel as though this response is necessarily pathological.   That said, if camping alone is your bag, try some exposure. Try site camping in a park with security. Or your backyard. Then advance gradually in the direction of what kind of camping you want to do."

Hammocks,2u9uta,mobile_cabin,1 point,Tue Feb 3 01:49:56 2015 UTC,"You think it's any different for tent or tarp campers? Hell, at least we're better off than the wet burritos of the bivy sack campers that a bear could just run over.   This is one of those fears that's its rational and irrational. First off, if you're scared, sleep in a respectable camping site and with people. Wilderness camping can be far more frightening on your own depending on where you are and your personal experience. But also, you're probably more likely to be killed anywhere else other than in the woods; there's a lot of misguided fear centered around the dangers of the outdoors. You're more likely to be killed in your home, by an accident.   Take the same precautions we all do: Hang or store your food away from your campsite. Don't make camp on or around animal trails and tracks. Make sure you're staying is a good area. Don't appear like you have something worth stealing. Friends do help, especially with calming concerns."

Can wild animals distinguish human urine from the urine of other creatures? The creatures you'd want to scare off are at the top of the food chain, so why would they even care?

Hammocks,2u9uta,jaxnmarko,0,Sun Feb 1 15:24:43 2015 UTC,"How do you get out to fill your car with gas when all alone?  We are always vulnerable to something though being in a more isolated spot means fewer people to save you if something happens, yet people stand around using their phones to video problems instead of stepping in to help all too often so go figure on that one.  So you either stay closer to more people and hope some will help, get more away from people to avoid any problem, prepare yourself mentally and perhaps have some means of defending yourself, or cower at home.  I do understand though.  But where I live I worry more about grizzly bears, black bears, mountain lions, and wolves. Maybe a wayward or inexperienced hunter or Dick Cheney with a gun, maybe a chainsaw wielding maniac, maybe a pack of rabid Boy Scouts, maybe an escaped prisoner. Statistically I'm safe.  Realistically I am in a possibly more dangerous situation.  Mentally I may be sleeping poorly and reacting to every little sound, despite the fact that nature provides many sounds.  Too many movies and news clips to get us scared!  But still, I get out their alone, over and over.  Being a woman is no longer an excuse.  You can have martial arts training, carry a gun (which is why its called the Equalizer.... you don't have to be big and strong to win), other weaponry, blinding light, loud siren,and so on. you can use the buddy system.  Strength in numbers. Carry spray and more.  And allow yourself to forget some of your worries and actually enjoy the nature you went to experience!  And get experienced!  But not complacent, just sensible and practical."
Hammocks,2u9uta,1stCitizen,1 point,Sat Jan 31 09:28:33 2015 UTC,Reading your reply made me realize my irrational fear of being attacked is magnified by my PTSD about being attacked while in a walled compound by a crazy homeless dude.

Hammocks,2u9uta,LTcompass,1 point,Sat Jan 31 20:17:39 2015 UTC,"There is no doubt that as a woman, you are more of a target in general, as well as being of smaller size and strength, in general..... unless you are a well trained, Amazon or comic book heroine type.  I didn't mean to suggest you are in no danger or that, especially considering your history, shit never happens to good people, which I imagine you might be.  My favorite lake is between Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks.  Grand Central Grizzly Bear Station.  I've camped there alone many times or in similar places in my area.  And I've taken some silly risks beyond that in camping there.  Yes, I may grill meat or a freshly caught fish.  Yes I used to bring my dog at times.  He's gone but I'm still here and still willing to accept certain risks in order to have time in an amazing location.  Bear spray, A gun, trip wires at times, good lights, loud air horn or whistle... never used, always at hand.  Precautions for safety though animals are far faster than we are.  There IS danger, but sometimes adrenaline is good, as is the times of the serenity of crystal clear waters, a sky full of stars with no city lights for many many miles, wildflowers and wind, and memories.  I do look over my shoulder now and then, I do fall asleep listening and wake up listening, and if something terrible does happen some day, better to meet my maker out there than hit by a car or shot by some idiot in some concrete jungle."

Hammocks,2u9ft6,CedarWolf,2,Sat Jan 31 17:17:22 2015 UTC,"I have this Viviere double hammock and I've been sleeping in it every night for the past two years. It's almost an exact copy of the Walmart one you've linked. The link I provided is more expensive because it also includes the 9 foot frame, which is well worth it.   In fact, the only reason I moved back to a traditional bed in December was because it gets cold during the winter and I got an amazing deal on a lofted bed. The previous winter, I just made a sandwich out of a two-person sleeping bag, then slipped myself into the top flap. The three layers of sleeping bag beneath me worked just fine to insulate me from the cold air around me. If you don't have some decent blankets, you will get cold during the winter, because there's cool air all around you. It's absolutely wonderful in the summer, though.  The only problem with sleeping in a hammock is that it's so dang comfy that you won't want to leave.   Also, the standard strings for the Viviere will eventually stretch with use, and if you use it a lot, you'll pop one or two after about a year and a half of constant use. Mind you, my hammock was acting as my bed and the main seat in my room... so whenever I was home, I was usually in my hammock. I've popped four strings so far, and the hammock still works just fine. It's just as stable as it always has been, it's just a little more comfortable now. I did pick up some 550 paracord online and I do intend to restring it with some stronger cord when I eventually need to.  I mentioned the summer just a moment ago. This hammock comes with a duffel bag, and you can pack all of the poles, a standard size pillow, and some twin-sized bedsheets into the bag, no problem. As such, it's my travel bed whenever I go on vacation with my friends. Just unscrew the knobs holding the poles together and the whole thing packs away in under 10 minutes. Chuck it in your trunk with the rest of the baggage and away you go."
Hammocks,2u9ft6,Osulagh,1 point,Tue Feb 10 06:27:26 2015 UTC,"Make a tablecloth hammock. Google it. All you'll need is a table cloth and some rope to tie the ends together with. A tablecloth is like $15 shipped, and you can throw another $5-10 for suspension (remember, it needs to hold 4 times your weight).   Or, you can check if your Walmart carries 1.9oz ripstop nylon by the roll and get 4 yards and tie that together. You can ask a local seamstress to do a rolled hem on the edges so the material doesn't fray.  Or, a cheapy hammock like a Grand Trunk or Yukon or a Dutchware hammock."

With me at 6', a 9'6"" is fine until I lay in a longer hammock--then it's a bit hard to return. It's not uncomfortable; it's just not as comfortable. It's one of the things that you might not mind until you've tried something else. Though I will say, some people do like shorter hammocks for different reasons. Longer is not always better.   The longer the hammock, the gentler the sag where you lay and the flatter you can lay in that sag while on the diagonal."

Hammocks,2u9ft6,whabt,1 point,Wed Feb 4 07:37:47 2015 UTC,"This is just my opinion... The ENO and other parachute/nylon fabric hammocks have their good qualities - lightweight, packable, compact. I'm just not a fan of having to ""lay"" sideways in order to lay flat. It's my opinion that the Mayan style hammock allows you to just lay naturally, you can throw down a sleeping pad and really have a bed and yet still use tarps and cocoons. Mayan style requires more distance between anchor points, whereas,  a Brazilian/ENO style requires less ""spread""/distance. I hear/read a lot about people dealing with ridge lines and other ""support"" lines they have to set up with their ENO's. I keep it it simple, I don't use brandname ""Atlas Straps"", I buy webbing by the foot and tie a knot where I need one. Here's what my Mayan looks like. It's big and comfy.

Hammocks,2u8zv0,thepingster,1 point,Sat Jan 31 01:18:43 2015 UTC,"Unless you're like 4'6"", forget trying for a short hammock. Longer hammocks aren't the ""cool thing on the block"" but a needed thing for many people. The majority of the hammocks you'll get off the shelf like ENO, Yukon, and the numerous others popping up make their hammocks around 9'6"" long which is a decent middle-ground for most people. They do this to cut cost. But, for some people who are nearing 6' tall, that length can be uncomfortable.   Either way, if space constant is a thing for you, going with a shorter hammock won't help. To hang a ENO hammock, you'll need between 8-10 feet of room. For a 11 foot hammock from like Dutchware or elsehwhere, you'll need 9-11 feet. The difference is between a foot and a foot and a half. Regardless, I suggest you need a minimum of 10 feet to hang a hammock--if you don't have this, don't bother IMO. These distances, FYI, are taking the amount of sag and distance removed from the hammock's suspension in mind."
Hammocks,2u8zv0,Osulagh,1 point,Sat Jan 31 02:04:58 2015 UTC,"The longer the hammock has absolutely nothing to do with being cool. It has to do with being able to hang in a true diagonal lay to actually have a proper nights sleep. Sleeping in shorter hammocks, unless you're 5'0"" or less, is not going to work out like you want it to. I have an 11' long hammock and can sleep on my side as well as my stomach without any discomfort. At 6'3"" that would never happen in a ENO."

Hammocks,2u40uj,manrubc,11,Thu Jan 29 19:18:57 2015 UTC,"Contrary to popular belief, the most comfortable way to sleep in a hammock is actually at an angle, like this.  Sleeping parallel to the hammock is certainly doable, but it creates weird ridges and pressure points.   It's a LOT easier to lay diagonally with a longer, wider, ""double-sized"" hammock. Look for something 11 feet long by 5 feet wide, or more.   A great option is the 11' Dutchware Argon hammock. It's rated for ~275lbs, the quality is on par or better than ENO and it can be ordered with a complete suspension package for about the same cost as an ENO DoubleNest."

The greater width of a ""double"" hammock doesn't really matter unless you're trying to get a deeper sag and a stronger angle of the body--most people don't sleep this way.  I say, skip ENO. I can't see the value in their hammocks when there are a lot of others out there that provide better hammocks, for less. Especially that both the double and the single nest hammocks are 9'4"" which is a good size... if you're 5' tall. You get far more comfort out of a longer hammock, like 10' to 11'. Check out Dutchware and their pre-made hammocks--you can get 11' ones there.   Also, you can make your own.

Hammocks,2u2jjr,idigholes,4,Thu Jan 29 11:01:17 2015 UTC,"Back too many years ago, I bought a two-line stunt kite.  The guy at the kite shop showed my his attachment method, which I have used over and over again over the years.  It's dirt simple.  On the end with the loop, where you are wanting to use a soft-shackle, he used nothing more than a overhand loop that he left tied all the time.  He then put a ""lark's head"" hitch over the bulky knot at the time he connected the kite.  Over years of very vigorous flying, the lark's head never came off of the bulky knot, and at the end of the flying day, it came off of the line in a second or two when I decided to disconnect it.    While I like the idea of the soft-shackle, it might be overkill.  Of course, if you want to make one, more power to you.  The solution you propose is really like making one side of the soft-shackle on one end of the hammock, and the other side of the soft-shackle on the other end of the hammock, which should work quite well."
Hammocks,2u2jjr,deck_hand,1 point,Thu Jan 29 15:33:56 2015 UTC,"A knot in the short end and a larks head over it instead of a soft shackle would be just as neat and definetly less work, thanks"
Hammocks,2u2jjr,realslacker,2,Thu Jan 29 16:16:09 2015 UTC,Why do you want to take it off?  When I started out I made an adjustable length ridgeline. I created it so that it could be adjusted from 80% to 90% of my hammock's length. I made a McDonald Brummel on one end (like a regular brummel except you don't have to feed the long end through) and a whoopie on the other end. All the adjustment happens in the whoopie.  A basic outline of how I made mine:   Before cutting your line make the McDonald Brummel in the end Measure your hammock Cut your line so that it's 100% of the length + 12 inches Start your whoopie at 80% Make your bury towards the Brummel end for 8 inches Make another small McDonald Brummel in the end of the buried line Feed the new bury over the whoopie so that it's around the ridge line (this keeps the line from pulling through the bury and keeps it off you while you sleep)   You should now have an adjustable length ridgeline. Once you find the length that is comfortable for you you can make a fixed length one.
Hammocks,2u2jjr,standardalias,1 point,Thu Jan 29 15:42:00 2015 UTC,"The reason I would need to take it off is that it will be under the bug net, so when I flip the hammock ( bug net underneath) I would need to detatch the ridge line.

If the SingleNest is working for you, aside from the suspension, then I don't see any reason to change it. If it's not working for you in some regard then it would be helpful to know more about that.  As for the suspension, Arrowhead Equipment's whoopie sling kit is an easy and cheap way to get everything you need all at once, but of course there are plenty of other ways to put things together if you want something a little different."
Hammocks,2tz6q0,HeyRememberThatTime,1 point,Wed Jan 28 17:27:08 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I cannot get flat enough for my liking in the singlenest and the slap straps are just a pain sometimes to get just right.

Hammocks,2tz6q0,HeyRememberThatTime,1 point,Wed Jan 28 18:29:48 2015 UTC,"Changing out for whoopies is a good move over the SlapStraps regardless of what direction you go with your hammock. And they can move with you if you decide you do want to change the hammock out after the fact.  Unless you're extremely tall there's really not much reason that you shouldn't be able to get a decent lie with your SingleNest, so I'd be a little suspicious that the problem might be in how you're hanging it. Part of that could be that the SlapStraps only give you so many adjustment points, but it could also just be practice in knowing what to shoot for. If it were me, I would want to rule that latter out first before I bought anything new.  Hanging overly taut is the most common mistake new hangers make, thinking that it will make it easier to lay flat. But what it really ends up doing is making ridges in the hammock that make it more uncomfortable. A structural ridgeline can help you get a more consistent amount of sag, but while you're experimenting and learning to get the right angles I think it can actually end up getting in your way a little bit."

There is no reason to shell out 70$ when you can get it for 20$. They also have the single bugnet on sale for 25$ as often and their new hammock which is lighter for 30$. Also, pick up a adjustable ridgeline from dutchware and use it. It will give you the same exact hang every time no matter what.

Hammocks,2tz6q0,McBlaster,0,Wed Jan 28 17:56:13 2015 UTC,"Buying a ""double"" sized hammock is advisable simply because you can more easily lay at an angle, which is generally much more comfortable. Dutchware makes quality hammocks at much lower prices and you can add a complete suspension system for a total cost comparable to the cost of just a Doublenest.

Hammocks,2tuffi,fromkentucky,11,Tue Jan 27 15:30:15 2015 UTC,"Depends on the rope you'd be using otherwise, but overall, the flat 1"" wide webbing will have more surface area grabbing the tree for a given amount of weight and it'll likely be stronger.  I will say that after switching to a cinch-buckle system, setup is a LOT faster than trying to get the right spacing and tying a series of knots.   Now it's just a matter of wrapping the straps around the tree (I like to use 1.5 turns, so there's a full ring of webbing gripping the tree), clipping the carabiners in place and pulling the tail end through the cinch buckle to the desired length. Literally takes maybe 30 seconds.  EDIT- You can buy a PAIR of 15' Tree Straps WITH Cinch Buckles and 8"" Amsteel Continuous Loops from Dutchware for $21.80+shipping and add either a pair of Titanium Dutch clips for $18 or, if you're like me, add a pair of Black Diamond climbing-rated carabiners for an additional $15.

Hammocks,2tuffi,YepYepImaRep,3,Tue Jan 27 16:11:22 2015 UTC,They definitely make damage to the tree a lot less likely. Even with tree straps I still avoid hanging on especially sensitive trees like birch.  To simplify your setup you could look at Dutchware.
Hammocks,2tuffi,Sketchy_Uncle,2,Tue Jan 27 17:18:03 2015 UTC,I love my Dutch bling! The whoopie hooks make setup a breeze. I made my own woopie slings and couldn't be any happier. It is so simple to adjust and I can hang in all sorts of situations.
Hammocks,2tuffi,deck_hand,3,Tue Jan 27 18:07:01 2015 UTC,"Tree huggers, as most people call them, are mainly to preserve and protect the tree, i'm not sure they offer any benefit security wise, other than easy and consistent setup and takedown, so there's less room for human error.   I use the dutchwaregear tree huggers/whoopie sling combo, light, easy and quick to setup, and very adjustible and scalable to add/remove modular components, based on my needs (i sometimes hang in the redwoods, so having much larger tree straps on hand then is great, but not always necessary).   good luck and whatever you choose, get out and hang in those piney woods, friend"

Hammocks,2tuffi,Sketchy_Uncle,1 point,Tue Jan 27 16:40:54 2015 UTC,than just tying off on the tree with no straps?
Hammocks,2tuffi,Sketchy_Uncle,2,Tue Jan 27 16:49:22 2015 UTC,"Depends on the hammock and the thickness of the cord and how you're wrapping it, and comparing to which type of strap, really.  There's a lot of ways to skin a cat.  I've slung hammocks with 7mm cord around birch and beech trees with multiple wraps that would very doubtfully put much more wear on the tree than a 1"" webbing strap, but I've seen 1.5"" webbing straps put way less wear on a black locust comparatively than, say 3mm dyneema cord....so it depends."
Hammocks,2tuffi,noeatnosleep,2,Tue Jan 27 17:45:14 2015 UTC,"I'd say get some 1.5-2"" webbing by the foot from REI, hardware store, whatever, and use that.  May run you a few-10$.  Simple girth hitch around itself and you're set."

I think enough people have recommended just buying some webbing. There is a mountain equipment store I can get to pretty easily so I'll probably just pick up a few meters of webbing @ $2/meter. Should I grab a couple caribiners as well?
Hammocks,2tuffi,justjeepin,2,Tue Jan 27 20:29:12 2015 UTC,"We stayed in a condo, but the patio was begging for a hammock.   I found a shop/brand that predates ENO style nylon ones, so I picked one up for 60.    I'd just go with the webbing and bring some paracord just in case.  Carabiner or S-hooks would  e great.   My Mexico net hammock uses heavy duty locking carabiners though.  Nice it have a set that you can strap on your backpack for other stuff and look even more hard-core /outdoorsy.   :P"

Hammocks,2tuffi,reallifedog,2,Tue Jan 27 19:25:17 2015 UTC,Cheapest way to get straps are the cambucke style.  Plenty secure and weigh less/smaller than rachet straps (and cheaper).  Also cheaper than hammock straps. http://mobile.walmart.com/ip/10-Cambuckle-Tie-Down-Green-900-lbs-4-Pack/25862078  The pic doesn't show that the ends are open hooks with eyes that you can hook one to another and form a nice V from the tree to your hammock line.
Hammocks,2tuffi,battle_cattle,1 point,Wed Jan 28 00:20:32 2015 UTC,"yeah, I'm either going to do that or just buy some webbing at a local climbing store. I'm sure either option will be fine. Never hung a hammock so have to experience some trial and error at some point, right."
Hammocks,2tuffi,e42343,2,Wed Jan 28 02:38:58 2015 UTC,"As a general rule, you want to use them.  However, if for some reason you only have cord, or you can't or don't want to carry straps, you can still preserve the tree by inserting an object to disperse the force of the cord against the tree.    The problem with using just cord is that it can seriously damage the tree.  I used to have a wooden frame I would hang from, and it had deep gouge marks in it because of where the cord would bite into it.  We don't want to do that to living trees.  If you only have cord, you can put sticks or some other object between the cord and the tree to spread out the force, but having tried it a few times, it is really more hassle than it is worth.  I'm sure you could imagine some scenario where it would be desirable to Macgyver a hammock where you don't have access to straps, but since this is the real world, just use straps."

I got a little chilly but my main problem is it seemed that I kept slipping and sliding around in the hammock.

I've seen all of the pictures of proper technique (diagonal!!!) but can't seem to figure it out. Any advice? I'd love to sleep in my hammock but can't trust it because I work out so much and need to have a good back"
Hammocks,2tow3u,Soccerrocks32,2,Tue Jan 27 03:54:17 2015 UTC,"I personally do not sleep on much of a diagonal at all. I lay my thermarest zlite down, get into my sleeping bag and hop in the hammock. I wake up well rested and my back feels great."
Hammocks,2tow3u,partywiz,4,Tue Jan 27 05:51:17 2015 UTC,"Another full timer checking in. Been doing it for almost 2 years and after the first 2 nights getting adjusted, I sleep like a baby and will never go back. The only time im in a bed is if im hooking up. If you're considering it then stop...and just go for it, you won't look back. Like I said it MIGHT take a night or two to get used to the feel so don't quit after your first night! Good luck and happy hangs!"
Hammocks,2tow3u,BunterHynum7,3,Mon Jan 26 06:03:59 2015 UTC,"I've been sleeping full time in a Yukon Outfitters Double Parachute Hammock since February 2014. It worked out alright. Though sometimes I'd wake up in the middle of the night and want to stretch out, so I'd move to the floor.   A couple weeks ago I decided to look into getting a more comfortable hammock. I did some googling and opted to go with this hand-made cotton Yukatan hammock. I am very glad I did. It's a little larger and much more comfortable. The cotton conforms to my body. I can get flat enough to sleep on my side, which is amazing btw. Highly recommend a cotton hammock for a permanent indoor setup. The difference in comfort is significant.  I also like to zip myself up in a sleeping bag to keep warm. I use a small neck roll pillow for my head, and a regular size pillow under my knees. It's quite comfy. I fall asleep very quickly and stay asleep all night."
Hammocks,2tow3u,jmess301,1 point,Tue Jan 27 19:20:47 2015 UTC,"Ahh, this response (along with everyone else's obviously) is much appreciated. Area of main concern, while my hammock is comfortable, I usually sleep on my side. Been constantly debating whether a nylon ripstop material, or cotton.  Think I'm going to attempt or at least price out what it costs to either make the pipe stand or the turtledog stand. Unfortunately the room I have doesn't allow me to simply put in eye hooks."
Hammocks,2tow3u,jmess301,1 point,Wed Jan 28 01:37:06 2015 UTC,Bummer you can't use eye bolts. One of the perks of using a hammock as a bed is that you can take it down and stow it while it's not in use (I live in a tiny studio where space is limited). Kinda hard to do with a pipe stand.
Hammocks,2tow3u,theideanator,3,Wed Jan 28 02:29:43 2015 UTC,"Hell yeah man, it's awesome.

When I have to wake up early, I'm less likely to go back to sleep because getting situated for sleep in a hammock takes a bit more effort than a bed! My back is more relaxed and I sleep very deeply."

Lucky for me - people are scared from rain.  I haven't pulled out my hammock for a looong time and it seems I've forgotten everything. I'm sitting there trying to tie up the ridge line and I don't know how to do it. The brain is trying to remember the knots, but eventually the fingers muscle memory helped.  It was a refreshing trip.

Floor of fallen needles, the open but yet shady space around you, the smell of the resin...  I don't know many backpackers, because most of the people around are just campers.

Everything is silent at 2AM, you are in one better world of sleepiness and sweet dreams when suddenly KRAAAAAUUUEEUUEEEEIIIK !!!!!!!!!!!   We have one other type of small owls that ping each other like a radar. DING ... PING ... they are literally sitting on the two ends of the wood and they are shouting over it.  Those are repetitive and would wake me up, but we are good with the owls.  The more disturbing type of noise is when you hear and feel something walking around you."

Hammocks,2tnaag,RojoNinja,2,Mon Jan 26 01:08:48 2015 UTC,"What I did was use 550 paracord to make up the extra length I needed in my room. Tie a couple loops with some strong knots that won't slip and hook the hammock to it. The knots should just tighten when you add weight, and then it'll be good. (been my solution for going on two years of nightly sleeping in my eno)"
Hammocks,2tnaag,RojoNinja,1 point,Mon Jan 26 04:01:48 2015 UTC,I was under the impression that you weren't supposed to use 550 for suspension. Is that safe?
Hammocks,2tnaag,mrjowee,3,Mon Jan 26 13:38:50 2015 UTC,"The only thing 550 isn't safe for is wrapped around trees to hang from (bad for the trees). I've been using the exact same few pieces I made when I first started sleeping in it nightly. I was at my heaviest weight then too and it hasn't failed at all, so it seems safe to me. I would just melt the ends to prevent fraying."

Hammocks,2tn6ij,mrjowee,4,Sun Jan 25 20:06:11 2015 UTC,"Eno has heavy market saturation with over priced, oddly shaped, heavy, ill-functioning gear. Usually high quality US made gear from cottage vendors is more expensive than the mass produced alternative, but that's not the case here. Also, ENOs ""new"" suspension is a 1"" poly strap with whoopie slings (though they don't call them that). That's been pretty widely used stuff for a long while now, and it's even on the way out in favor of anchors/speed hooks."
Hammocks,2tn6ij,HeyRememberThatTime,1 point,Sun Jan 25 23:12:30 2015 UTC,"I did a little more digging and found ENO's media guide for ORWM15 that shows the Sub7 and other new products they're releasing. Trailspace also has a video of the Sub7 being demonstrated there in ENO's booth. Looks very small, as the stated dimensions suggest.  From the video their ""Helios straps"" just look to be huggers with whoopie slings, but I can't figure out why they've got what looks to be camring line tensioners spliced into fixed eyes there in the photos in the media guide. The only thing I can think of is that maybe they've done that at the end of the buried section to prevent the user from pulling it back through, though that would seem to be a ton of overkill."
Hammocks,2tn6ij,HeyRememberThatTime,0,Mon Jan 26 16:15:37 2015 UTC,"At 6.5oz, the ENO Sub7 certainly is light. It's also tiny. REI lists the unfolded size at 105"" x 47"". At well under 9', I don't see how an average height person could possibly get a flat lie in such a short hammock. At 6' tall, I find a 10' hammock marginally acceptable."
Hammocks,2tn6ij,HeyRememberThatTime,2,Sun Jan 25 20:09:45 2015 UTC,"47"" wide?! Even if it were longer it would hardly matter with as narrow as it is. ENO really needs to get that hammocks aren't meant to be used ""banana style."""

Hammocks,2tfg5r,TehGogglesDoNothing,10,Sat Jan 24 07:28:46 2015 UTC,"If you look at the material costs of DIYing your own, there isn't really that much mark up.  Argon 67 is like $10 a yard if buying material for one.  You'll probably need at least 5-6 yards.  About 2 yards for each side and the extra 2 yards for baffling.  850 fill power down is $8-10 an ounce and you're looking at 11-13 ounces in the Incubator 20 or 15-17 in the Incubator 0.  Then there's grosgrain around the edges, shock cord, cord locks, clips, etc.  You're looking at about $175-200 in materials to make the Incubator at home.  And then there's the labor involved.  You're paying less than $100 for someone with experience making underquilts to make it right.  You could use a basic 1.1 ounce silnylon and 650 fill down (which you'll need almost 50% more of to provide the same loft) to make one at a lower price, but you'll increase weight and bulk by about 50% or more.  tl;dr - top end materials aren't cheap"

The warmth/weight/quality to price ratio is actually pretty good I would say.   Edit: Also I just remember that this guy's temperature ratings are done very differently than the industry does. The industry rates sleeping bags (you probably already know this) for the temperature a female adult could survive at in the sleeping bag. So if it is 0 degrees and you are a girl in a 0 degree sleeping bag with just like a base layer on you will be insanely cold, but alive. The Hammock Gear guy tries to rate his sleeping bags more conservatively to what you would be comfortable in at that temperature, so his 20 degree bag could be comparable to some 10 degree and 0 degree bags. If you look at the amount of down he uses and the quality of down, it is really awesome. He uses more and better down for his 20 degree UQ than the yeti does for its 0 degree."

Hammocks,2td3qq,XxBurntOrangexX,3,Fri Jan 23 06:45:47 2015 UTC,Your quilts are usually your biggest investment with your setup and rightly so. I highly suggest saving money to get an underquilt with a decent temp rating. Whether you go with synthetic or down is up to you whether or not the benefits of either are more important.   There is always diy. My buddy and I spent a night converting a 10° sleeping bag into a period. Was a pretty good investment considering the bag was only 30 bucks and a fee hours of our time.
Hammocks,2td3qq,imranilzar,2,Fri Jan 23 08:12:46 2015 UTC,"I've considered DIY, but I'm with two left hands when it comes to craft. And a decent low-temp sleeping bag costs quite a money itself. It is much possible that I'm gonna ruin it and burn even more money.  It is interesting how an UQ is going to be the most expensive thing in my hammock system. So far by now everything in that system combined don't cost like a single UQ. I've went out in the summer and sometimes in autumn with no need of UQ. I'm camping relatively rare when temps are between 30-40F and that's why I'm not willing to put a massive amount of money in it."
Hammocks,2td3qq,XxBurntOrangexX,2,Fri Jan 23 13:05:48 2015 UTC,"If CF pads are working well for you in that temp range then I'd just stick with those. If you ever want to dip your toes into the freezing temps then I would suggest something a little more substantial.   Look into pea pods though. It has its drawbacks compared to two independent quilts such as reducing how diagonally you can lay in your hammock but its generally a more cost efficient route then separate TQ/UQs. And sowing for it is really no challenge at all. Just need a cheap sleeping bag, some polyester straps to make loops with and some shock cord."

Hammocks,2td3qq,aidanpryde18,2,Fri Jan 23 04:30:20 2015 UTC,"Eh, they won't bother you unless you're leaving food out.  Take a look at getting an underquilt of some sort.  I've used both a pad and an underquilt, and to me, there's no comparison.  UQ is better in every way... most importantly, in that it ensures even coverage."
Hammocks,2td3qq,Laurifish,1 point,Fri Jan 23 15:27:57 2015 UTC,I need an underquilt if I'm going to be doing anymore winter camping. It was chilly with foam pad and sleeping bag.
Hammocks,2td3qq,mrjowee,1 point,Fri Jan 23 15:33:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's a pretty simple reason for this if you don't know it already.  The sleeping bag compresses underneath of you, pinched between you and your hammock.  While the foam pad will help (right underneath you), you're still losing all your bottom insulation on your sleeping bag.  What tended to happen to me was that I would sweat from my sleeping bag being warm on top of me, and then freeze anytime I moved because I had little to no bottom insulation in parts.  The UQ stays nice and fluffy underneath of you all night long, keeping you evenly warm.  Most are even pretty adjustable so that if you get too warm, you can open it up just a bit, enough so that you're not boiling, or if you're too cold, you can snug it up to you a bit more.  I've never had a bad night in a hammock since I got the UQ.  Bourbon also helps."
Hammocks,2tdx98,renewedhope,3,Fri Jan 23 08:29:44 2015 UTC,Preach brother. I severely injured my back about 10 years ago and even an air mattress causes severe stiffness and pain. With my hammock I wake up refreshed and pain free. I haven't looked back since.
Hammocks,2tdx98,fromkentucky,2,Fri Jan 23 15:21:56 2015 UTC,"Same. Wish I could tell more people about it. Daily back pain for maybe 10+ years, sleeping on all types of beds/floors/futons. Completely resolved by hammock."
Hammocks,2tap2y,idigholes,5,Thu Jan 22 15:47:44 2015 UTC,"I ripped the netting on mine while pulling the shock cord through the loops in the net. Mine held up great for two seasons, but it was definitely showing wear beyond that point."
Hammocks,2tap2y,Firebert010,1 point,Thu Jan 22 17:31:28 2015 UTC,"How would you rate it compared to other Hammocks? this is my first and it seems amazing, spacious and the material feels almost like silk.  Have you had a better one?"
Hammocks,2tap2y,Firebert010,3,Thu Jan 22 17:41:21 2015 UTC,"It's solid, got everything you might want in a beginner hammock. For the price it can't really be beat. this item is appropriate as a first time setup,  but if you want something more durable, check out warbonnet or henessey."
Hammocks,2tap2y,swampwalker906,2,Thu Jan 22 18:29:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'm hoping this one will last me a while, I did consider the Henessey, I wasn't too sure about the bottom entry method though."

Hammocks,2tap2y,Osulagh,2,Fri Jan 23 08:10:05 2015 UTC,"I've flipped out of my beeter several times. Netting held my weight too. I love these things. There is a lot of hate on this hammocks for no reason. The majority of the time it's the users fault it rips, any brand hammock would do the same. I like grand trunk so much I got 2 beeters and a ultralight. Good starting point for the necessary mods"
Hammocks,2tdq1g,alanontheroad,2,Fri Jan 23 06:46:01 2015 UTC,that looks crazy!
