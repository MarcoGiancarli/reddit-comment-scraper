It is juvenile and is not a way to align political votes.  If I saw an image of something I didn't like and thought it was all I needed to convince myself to protest the issue, I would not be satisfied with myself.  If I recall, Harper shut down and isolated the anti-abortion MP's out of their own House of Commons speeches."

No, I don't agree with abortion, yes I think women should have the choice... and I have no kids, but these were stuck in the doors of every house in the neighborhood.  There are quite a few kids around here and I can almost guarantee some of them saw these things.  I was pretty angry.  It's highly alienating."

Years ago I worked at BMG and knew someone who worked there that managed bands in mississauga.  She was delusional and over important taking the job in a call center to 'be industry' but at the same had many convos with her about how it was an industry.  She convinced me at the time that it was a dog eat dog type environment where aggressive managers were the bands best friends to get gigs.  I assume things have changed.    Are managers still a thing setting up gigs or do musicians knock on your door?

mississauga,3dkb2x,Dumptruck_Cavalcade,4,Fri Jul 17 06:19:41 2015 UTC,"I think you need to be a bit more specific, as Lake Shore goes across the entire city of Toronto.  Where are you looking to go?  As someone has mentioned, if you just want the closest beach, you can drive to Marie Curtis Park right on the Mississauga/Etobicoke border and use their (free) parking lot.  If you want to go futher into the city, you can park either on Lake Shore in Etobicoke (you'll have to pay, depending on time of day) or on one of the side streets for free and then take the GO train from Long Branch or the 501 streetcar from anywhere on Lake Shore."
mississauga,3dkb2x,mnrvr,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:00:53 2015 UTC,"Depends where you want to end up on Lakeshore/ which Bear. If its Queens Quay there is parking right across from the ACC or even south of the Gardiner, the Westin has parking thats paid if you want to go to the island and is close to the ferry. The Exhibition/Ontario Place also has parking if you want to be on that side of lakeshore.  If you want Sugar Beach you can park by St. Lawrence Market in the Green P that has entrances on the bottom of Church and Esplanade and Market and Esplanade (cheaper option).  If you are talking about Sunnyside there is parking lots right around the beach but i expect them to get pretty full and don't really know to much about that beach"

mississauga,3dg75a,skybike,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:24:55 2015 UTC,It's been a few years but I know I just followed the directions on the box. You want to avoid putting them on your gums as it irritates them slightly. I think it's worth a try since it's so much cheaper. A dental hygienist will only make your teeth so white as they want to make your teeth a natural color which is slightly off white so keep that in mind as well.

mississauga,3d5n13,Roogoyle,12,Mon Jul 13 18:45:46 2015 UTC,As an aside there is always studio 89 for open mics. They don't always have them but check out the website.  I think the city is just spaced out so weirdly.

mississauga,3d5n13,Roogoyle,3,Mon Jul 13 20:21:24 2015 UTC,"Port credit actually has a fantastic bar scene. I live 5 minutes north of square one so I'm in a kind of a deadzone.   The thing is we are in a state of emerging art and emerging culture. Our population, an estimated 760million, is finally hitting that point were we need to create.  Frog in hand is an interesting arts group based out of mississauga. They're a bunch of 20 something's who just do stuff.  At least we have some great scenery. A damn fine crowd of BoardGamer enthusiasts and everyday we are not Brampton is a blessing.  What do you like to do anyways?"

mississauga,3d5n13,Roogoyle,12,Tue Jul 14 23:28:10 2015 UTC,"This, kind of. Toronto is so close to Mississauga that, almost everyone just go there for nightlife. I feel like Mississauga is a good area for middle-aged people with family, while Toronto is for the young professionals."

mississauga,3d5n13,FuzzyFish6,5,Mon Jul 13 20:00:24 2015 UTC,"I think this is because there's no one big ""downtown"" that people can just hang out in after work.  That plus the close proximity to Toronto and that Mississauga is more of a driving city than walking city would also contribute to this probably.  I don't really know if there's a night scene per se in the pockets of downtown like Port Credit, Cooksville, or Streetsville though."
mississauga,3d5n13,number8888,5,Mon Jul 13 19:28:00 2015 UTC,"I think your totally right.   People tend to blame Toronto for Mississauga lack of culture/ soullessness but really it comes down to how the city grew. Huge chunks of land were sold to subdivision developers who built products instead of community.  hence the car commuter culture, lack of business area development in the ""downtown"" core"

But in the last 3 - 4 years, I've seen a lot more than before. For example, the events on the Square by the main library. On Port Credit, I'm seeing more smaller creative companies start up.  The city has some ambitious plans when it comes to arts and culture.   We can never be like Toronto, and being so close to Toronto has made it difficult for a local scene to develop like it has in Burlington or Guelph. However, it's a matter of time, and I'm sure that we'll start to see changes."
mississauga,3d5n13,worldprecipice,6,Tue Jul 14 11:30:43 2015 UTC,"Consumer-facing businesses that sell non-essentials face the problem of low population density.  Low pop density caused by urban sprawl.  Urban sprawl caused by oodles of undeveloped real estate for the past several decades, parcelled out by the City to developers to build cookie-cutter houses and new roads at low cost.  Those are the basics. Others here have pointed out other good reasons. Another one is the ultra-low property taxes, which Hazel McCallion cleverly mined into political longevity. Well, guess what, low taxes mean a budget-conscious City Hall that doesn't want to invest in density-building infrastructure. You can't walk around in most of this city, pedestrians are an afterthought.  My favourite example is the MiWay TransitWay station. They're very impressive until you realise pedestrians have no easy way of transferring between buses which do and don't run on the TransitWay. Local buses don't actually enter the stations! You have to get off the bus and traverse pedestrian crossings. Oh, and if you're transferring to a local bus you have to wait for it outside without shelter and look across at the people in the station waiting for the Express buses.  Whoops, this is my favourite rant subject."

Port credit is also a great place to hang out as it have spots for everyone. Saying that mississauga only has condos and strip malls is like saying Toronto only has office buildings and the CN tower.  Open your eyes OP...
mississauga,3d5n13,al57115,0,Mon Jul 13 23:40:38 2015 UTC,"While it's good to have decent restaurants, I don't think most people would consider them cultural or nightlife spots.

But just for the sake of argument, please tell me where in Mississauga someone can find the following:   a live music venue with current or independent bands playing something other than covers of radio pop or boring coffee shop acoustic guitar a movie theatre playing independent or documentary films a nightclub featuring international DJs (or DJs playing anything but R&B/pop) a non-chain clothing store a non-chain record or book store selling new releases a jazz bar a brewpub"
mississauga,3d5n13,Akraz,2,Tue Jul 14 19:06:37 2015 UTC,"Oh i see i have a hipster to contend with...  Well as for live music, many of the pubs have live local musicians playing. Lots of places in Port credit as well as Streetsville.  Many of the Clubs in Mississauga, routinely have guest DJs perform..maybe not a frequent as Toronto but there are events.  Union social eatery, Mill st brew pub, the pump and co. Failte Irish Pub,Wilcox Gastro pub, ...  As for movie theaters, the main cineplexes is what we have but they do play foreign movies and the odd ""art house"" film.  As for non chain clothing store? I assume you are referring to used clothing stores as we do have a few goodwills and value villages. but if you mean independent stores, again Streetsville and port credit as well as Erin mills have what you are looking for.  Look we, can debate this all day but I understand that YOUR lifestyle may be ""Too cool"" for Mississauga and your Ironicness (is that a word?) but just because Mississauga does not fit your tastes, does not mean it's soulless."

Anyone who doesn't want to spend every Friday night eating dinner at Kelsey's, followed by the latest Transformers movie at the multiplex?  Guilty as charged, I guess...  As of 2011, the population of Mississauga was 713,000+ (according to Wiki).  A city just shy of 3/4 of a million people with zero cultural life is soulless, regardless of its proximity to a larger city; a cover band playing Virgin Radio songs in a faux-Irish pub isn't exactly a thriving cultural scene.  I'm not suggesting that chain restaurants and generic plazas shouldn't exist - just that there needs to be at least some other options in order for a place to bill itself as a city in its own right (as opposed to a perennial second-rate suburb)."
mississauga,3d5n13,Akraz,2,Tue Jul 14 20:54:01 2015 UTC,"Failte's and Beir Market always have original bands playing original music, sure with some covers mixed in. They also have open mic nights. Failte's has the most authentic Irish cooking you can find in Mississauga. Spice Lounge is a really popular jazz bar. West 50 and &company always seem to be packed.  Basically, every plaza in Mississauga has some sort of mom and pop restaurant. There are some of the best independent pizza places and burger joints in Canada within our boarders.  Celebration Square has some sort of festival going on every weekend. There are also open mic nights and organized shows.  A handful of local breweries you can buy local brew from.  I really don't see your argument."

Edit: Richmond hill is dominanted by Russian/Jewish/Asian. There is a middle eastern presence growing here now but for the most part RH is pretty culturally non-diverse.

Out of all these towns/cities, Mississauga is personally my favorite. Maybe its a biased opinion because I was raised here, but I personally love what we have going on in this city.   Its cool if you think Mississauga isn't that exciting (because its not), I just don't get how you can complain about nightlife in a suburb that is literally right next to the fourth largest city in North America.

mississauga,3cy59a,Donkeypunchr,7,Sat Jul 11 21:03:23 2015 UTC,"I consider my Wind plan an investment. When they finally start to roll out more coverage and increasing prices I will have a bitchin' plan with unlimited data.  Otherwise, it's fine. Data speeds are not the best, call quality is OK. Signal strength is pretty decent in most parts of the GTA but they do have dead zones, e.g my basement. Square One used to be a data dead zone up until a month ago.  I personally don't have a problem with it since I don't call or text often, but I do use data a lot when I am around.  If you wish you can probably try out the network for a month or two off contract if your current phone is unlocked."

With that said, I've been with Wind for about three years in the Streetsville area.  Signal strength was a major problem for the first year, but has improved immensely in the past year.  $40 a month for unlimited everything, so I'm not complaining."

mississauga,3cy59a,cynicalbrownie,2,Sun Jul 12 20:50:59 2015 UTC,"If you want something cheaper than wind (and more reliable, since you get all the calls) do this: Get a data plan.  Either Bell's 20 dollars/month/month or Tbaytel's 100 dollars/20gigabytes/1 years  (8.5 dollars/1.6g/month) Bell has a better internet coverage (LTE) vs Tbaytel's 4G internet, but I want to save money.  After you you get your data, sign up with voip.ms, (~3 dollars a month) and you'll have a phone line on your phone (over the internet). If you have android you can text too, or get sms over email if on iphone.  Search this subreddit for a thread i made, or PM if you want more info.  Also, if you're not techy, you can go for the koodo 48 dollar a month unlimited everything  (google search how to get it, I haven't done this so I don't know)"
mississauga,3cy59a,bipolargraph,2,Sun Jul 12 08:51:23 2015 UTC,Wind coverage in that area is spotty. Close to the Wallmart on argentia there is no coverage.   As far as wind goes having unlimited data is great and roaming in the USA is amazing. I don't get good reception  at home (Tomken and Dundas)   I'm still hoping they will improve the coverage
mississauga,3cy59a,guimmer,2,Sun Jul 12 12:10:58 2015 UTC,"Hey dude! I've been havign the same issues, but the price i pay on my bill make it worthwhile when i hear crazy stories from people about bell and rogers.  There's a few tricks you can try, in order of likelyhood of them working:  Turn the data switch off for about 15 seconds, then turn it back on.  Turn airplane mode on for about 30 seconds. Then back off. Turn airplane mode on for about 2-3 minutes, then turn it back off Turn your phone off for about 5 minutes, then back on.  The network apparently gives priority to recently connected devices. Not sure how true this is, but this is the order i use and it seems to work like a charm every time.  Except for one day where i legit had no signal for the day, about a week or 2 ago lol"

Argentia and winston Churchill was a persistent dead zone,  but just yesterday i actually spoke to my wife on her wind phone while she was walking around shopping in the WalMart!  Crazy i know, so perhaps they finally addressed the poor coverage in that area. Wind will get better, at the last frequency auction the govt held, they won the juiciest piece of bandwidth that when used will eliminate the penetration issues their current bandwidth has. There's nothing like paying $40 for a $40 plan.  When i was with Telus i had a $35 plan and somehow paid almost $80 monthly."

mississauga,3clww3,worldprecipice,3,Wed Jul 8 22:51:06 2015 UTC,I would love to have more decent coffee places around. My favourite since the Guilty Dog closed is Studio 89. It would be nice to have more options in the south end of the city. I'm not sure if Clarkson is any cheaper than Port Credit but there is an empty shop in one of the buildings down there and they are building a condo close by.
mississauga,3clww3,melaniemad,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:58:07 2015 UTC,"Because we want to combine a cafe with a performance venue, costs become serious.  We're really thinking about the Clarkson area due to costs. Would you drive to Clarkson to be in a coffee place?  We go to Studio 89 a lot and it's a great place.  What do you look for in a cafe?"
mississauga,3clww3,melaniemad,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:11:33 2015 UTC,"I live between Clarkson and Port Credit, so I would be quite happy to have a place to go in Clarkson. :) I will admit I go to the chain places often around here just because they are convenient. About once a week I make the trip up to Studio 89 because I like the atmosphere.  There are some cafe type places in Port Credit, but they tend to be more restaurant like. I prefer a casual atmosphere that is comfortable to hang out in. Music performances are great too as long as they aren't deafening. I like a coffee place where the coffee and tea are good and there are a lot of options. It's hard to find a good London Fog in this town!  Edit: One more thing I look for in a cafe - for it to be open! It's frustrating when there are great cafes that close at 4 or 5 in the afternoon."
mississauga,3clww3,melaniemad,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:57:20 2015 UTC,"We'd definitely want to be open late.  Till 10 or 11, and later on performance nights.   Also, my apologies - the area we're looking at is Southdown, a little west of Clarkson."

mississauga,3clww3,RogueViator,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:29:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, I don't think there's much foot traffic there at all.  However, at the price point we can afford, the spaces there really meet the square foot and height needs of a theatre area.

The space we're thinking of is a 10 minute walk."

mississauga,3clww3,Albizzy,2,Thu Jul 9 03:08:50 2015 UTC,Try to see if there are any open places in Streetsville or even the Erin Mills area. It's near a GO line and the area's known for having performances on a regular basis. Rents may be more affordable there as well.

mississauga,3cl5rc,pelito,6,Thu Jul 9 16:47:58 2015 UTC,The final development will include a second Dundas entrance just west of the current one where the plaza was torn down earlier this year but there was a delay in the work.  Initially the entrance from Dundas was a three way stop with traffic entering from Dundas having the right of way. It was changed to a four way stop because there were massive backups getting out of the plaza and numerous fender benders and close calls had resulted from impatient drivers trying to get through the three-way stop.

mississauga,3cld50,shady89,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:22:29 2015 UTC,"It spans many genres. There is rock, hip hop, acoustic, garage punk, ... lots. This is some of the best local talent that hasn't quite made it big yet, but some of these bands are just on the cusp of ""making it"". For example, Tomahawk Love made it to the finals of HTZ 97.7 fm Rock Search contest this year, but they didn't win.  Many of these bands have songs available to listen to on their websites or social media. Check out http://rockthecoliseum.net for details on each band.

Also just got new owners, so they might give you a good deal (their whole milk is $1 cheaper than everywhere else as a promotion, so who knows, other things might be cheaper too)  Another one is Kabul Farms, at Dundas and Parkerhill. The chicken there is horrible. But they may have access to whole cows.   Good luck!"

mississauga,3calu6,MRxN0body,14,Mon Jul 6 12:15:28 2015 UTC,"Do you have a job or family or some other reason you're sticking around Mississauga? If not, consider a long road trip. Pack a tent, and drive across  Canada, stop traveling when the winds favor you. I recommend starting going east - is a more scenic drive. By the time you return to Ontario, maybe you'll have a new perspective. Or maybe you need to keep traveling and head west.  If you do have something/someone forcing you to stay in the GTA, perhaps moving to a new community and starting fresh. Maybe to streetsville  , port credit, Brampton, Oakville, etobicoke, etc... Call out your friends when you've had a chance to heal from the breakup, but otherwise don't call them.  If they ask to see you before you're ready just tell them that you're still hurting from the break up and you need some time before seeing them. If they don't understand, then they aren't interested in helping you - only themselves or your ex.   Edit: Create a new community that aren't associating with your old community. Start by meeting new people. What do you enjoy? Do you like playing sports - join a community league. Anime? Comics? Sci Fi? Join the organizing committee for one of the many conferences that taker place in Toronto/gta. Gaming? Start attending indie gaming nights at places like bento miso. You'll meet people in these types of situations and you'll share similar interests and begin to build a new social circle."
mississauga,3calu6,neowie,3,Mon Jul 6 12:38:10 2015 UTC,"Don't skip. Find new people. Don't let them ruin you. You don't need that. Build yourself up and move on. Just cause you were friends with certain people don't mean you need too continue having them in your life. I hate when people treat you nicely because it benefits them then when they. Aren't in the mood the treat you like shit and talk down to you. Your so called friends aren't your friends. Yes you may have done something to someone at some point but that doesn't give your friends a right to that and that's not mature, fuck I'd hang with you if I knew you were cool. If you need to chat let pm bro.  Keep your head up and remember you are worth having good people in your life."
mississauga,3calu6,Harroprease11,3,Mon Jul 6 17:16:27 2015 UTC,"I like to subscribe to the old ""You can't run away from your problems"".  Though in breakups, Time Heals All...  you definitely need time, and you should take that time before you up and move.  I've thought of taking off when I was younger, but I like the fact I live close to family, moving away just to ""get away"" wasn't an option for me.   It's important to remember that you're young, and whomever he or she was, there will be more.  It's the way it is. You have plenty of time.    When I was in a similar situation to you, I joined a lot of clubs and did things I didn't do when I was with them.  I got away from some friends, and leaned on others.  I joined Soccer and Softball social clubs and met a TON of people.  Hung out with them, and it let me re-evaluate some friendships.  Some are still good friends, some are friends I don't talk to, others are acquaintances and we touch base now and then.  It's life.  I've made some great friends I would never have made through the clubs ( doesn't have to be sports, but the social aspect made it perfect, plus I stayed in shape, and it was co-ed which was also beneficial ).  Then I took a trip to see a friend I hadn't in awhile. Met a girl and ""obla di obla da"".  Take some time, do stuff you don't normally do, and see what happens. That may or may not include moving to the other side of the continent.  If you're in the area, and want a beer with a stranger, I'm in.  I'm 35, male and married, no creepy shit, just an ear."
mississauga,3calu6,swrdfish,2,Mon Jul 6 21:39:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for this reply, honestly it isn't much ""running away"" as it is ""getting away"". I don't want to leave Mississauga permanently. It's just hard for me to have to live in the house that she was just with me at for 2 years. We owned a cat together, whom I have been taking care of an a bunch of other stuff that make it so that everywhere I look I'm reminded of them.   However I do understand where you are coming from and I'd love to meet new people and try new things. What is there in Mississauga though? Living here all your life makes it seem as if you've done it all."
mississauga,3calu6,lookupinthesky,3,Tue Jul 7 12:23:41 2015 UTC,"My two cents: go to California. Sometimes we need a break, we need a fresh start. Settle in a new place and meet new people. Become a happy person again and shed your burden. A place with constant sun and palm trees really does brighten up your mood.    I lived in San Francisco for a short while and found myself grow. Learned a lot about myself in addition to other areas. I will be returning to California in August, it really is a nice place to live. Hope you find happiness again no matter what you decide to do."

Most everywhere I turn people know me and most of them take my ex's side due to them being very convincing... and I'm unsure of how to just disappear. Any ideas? Luck is low on money right now, as it is hard to recover after a common law relationship. Edit: Honestly I've tried doing the whole ""rebound"" thing and just can't bring myself to.

The only thing tying me back are the mixed messages I keep getting from that group of friends and my previous significant other. Do I keep trying while they're seeing somebody else? Obviously the answer is no, however those are all the people that I have known and held dear to me since I was much younger. I'm in my early twenties now and they've all been around spanning from when I was about five, so there is so much history here. However it feels like it may be time to move on due to the fact that they have all been lying/keeping secrets from me for the last month and a bit. Other than that most everyone between the age group 16-25 know who I am or at least tidbits of stuff that had happened and it's extremely difficult for me to go up to somebody and say ""Hey, I'm _____,"" and for them not to be like ""Oh my god, I've heard this or that about you!""  And whether it's a good thing or a bad thing that they have heard, it would be nice to be somewhere where nobody really knows who I am/things that they have heard."
mississauga,3calu6,DotAClone,3,Mon Jul 6 13:39:57 2015 UTC,"Seriously, step away for a little while. Whether physically or emotionally.  Get some perspective. Your friends will be there for you when you return.  Yes you have history, and that is why they will be there when you return. Don't concern yourself with your ex, or your friends when you are healing. Concern yourself with you. Sticking around will generate drama that will make you feel worse. Not participating in the drama will stop feeding the fire.   Unless you want the drama, then stay where you are, pursue your ex, cling to your friends, and continue to trying to make yourself feel better by making other people feel shitty."
mississauga,3calu6,longjonesilver,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:10:33 2015 UTC,"Only advice I have for you is to walk away from her, and those people. Friends don't shit on each other for no reason.

Bake it and put delicious stuff on top. Like Nutella and penut butter chocolate ice cream.   I got creative once and put white sugar on top of the pie and used a butane torch to caramelize the sugar.

I think at this point I would much prefer using a damn car...at least it would drop me right where I need to be!  Also its stupid as fuck how they got rid of the weekly passes and put the monthly only instead.. Wtf happens when you don't get it the first week of the month? You still pay $120 yet you should actually be paying $90.... but nope they don't care.  Oh and wtf happened to the fare? It went up like a full dollar in less than a year apparently.
mississauga,3c08ib,DanLynch,3,Sat Jul 4 02:30:12 2015 UTC,Why wouldn't you have to pay twice to transfer between TTC and MiWay?
mississauga,3c08ib,DanLynch,-2,Sat Jul 4 05:43:29 2015 UTC,Well when all or most public transportation use the same type of payment. You would assume you wouldn't have to pay twice when you are using the same type of payment while you're still in your 2 hours transfer..

If I take a taxi to the movie theater and pay with my credit card, and then pay for the movie with the same credit card, should the cost of the movie be free (or reduced) because I transferred from the taxi within two hours on the same Mastercard? That makes no sense at all.  Presto is just a payment card system, like Interac or Mastercard. MiWay and TTC are two totally separate businesses that have no fare-transfer agreement between them. It has nothing to do with Presto."

Would have made travelling from mississauga to toronto easier.   A subway for mississauga isn't ""a little debt"". It's been said on here over and over again you can tell who the pipe dreamers are by their belief that Mississauga could install a subway system and actually make money off it. The majority of Mississauga residents work in Mississauga (according to statscan)  If the rather-convenient MiWay BRT is losing money, how many people would be taking the subway every day? Daily ridership would need to increase twenty-fold, which is not going to happen. Not in the near future, at least.  Would it be TTC or MiWay? Would you have to pay twice to get on the Mississauga subway and then the TTC subway? Why would mississauga foot the entire bill for a TTC extension when it is easing congestion on provincial highways? Do we know how much a subway costs, and can predict (based on our population and an extrapolated ridership figure) what the ROI would be? Because if we dug a 20km hole in the ground, our taxes would double, the city would be broke, and traffic along hurontario would still be f*cked, and that's ignoring upgrades to the existing transit.  Sorry to make you a poster child for the subway chanters, but ya'll should reconsider the demographics & financial pre-requisites for a subway besides the convenience factor."

I do this for a living and believe me I hear so often “oh don't worry about getting a job just volunteer”. Dead wrong.   Volunteering looks amazing if you have the financial means and time for it.

mississauga,3bj3ta,for_research_only,2,Mon Jun 29 18:03:37 2015 UTC,"Tip: Use a designer. They will send it to a trade printer. Good printers do not deal directly with the public. If you designed it yourself any photocopy shop or mystery printer with an online presence will take the job. You will have to decide on two of the following list of three: Good, fast, inexpensive. The world works this way. Especially the design and printing world. Another piece of advice if you are a start up: Don't kill to get luxurious business cards. Distribution is key. This means more is far better, if they are given out, than a few expensive ones that sit in a drawer. I also tell my clients, hand out fewer cards, take more potentials out for a coffee meeting to discuss possible solutions. Then follow up. These rules don't generally apply if you are creating a personal card. Ie a calling card."
mississauga,3bj3ta,aaffpp,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:00:20 2015 UTC,"That's a very good point. I guess it's a mix of both, a personal calling card, because it has my name instead of a business name, and also a business card, that entails the services I provide: camera, editing and sound. For my first batch of cards, I want the luxe feel to it. Give whoever I network with the idea that they're getting quality from me. Which is also risky, considering the expectations they'll have and me living up to them. But I want to make an impressive first impression and the luxe card will do. After that, my design may stay the same or change, but the card type will always change. But thank you for the reply."

Is it possible to get a credit card form Bahrain for use here? ie. I can get a card form TD in US funds for use in the US, I doubt Wells Fargo would give me a card though.

You also want something that is more reliable, and good customer service. That is why I'd recommend VDSL over Cable.  Best company with the best peering is Start Communications. www.start.ca   Start has the best rating on DSL reports, and has a great network. Second comes Teksavvy, which I've only had problems with on Cable (been fine with VDSL).   Go for VDSL2+ 50 with start. You don't need a 100, or even 60. You don't even need 50, I'm on 25, and can do anything with low latency(gaming/voip/etc) while my family watches videos."

I just switched to this company called Acanac and they're awesome too. I use the DSL not cable internet at 25Mbps and I have zero problems while everyone streams and uses the internet.  The only thing about the smaller companies is that they give you (or make you purchase) a modem with built in wifi. I find that the built in wifi in the modem is garbage with low speeds and terrible range. I just went out and invested $200 in a fantastic NetGear router that gives me awesome wifi anywhere in my house, backyard, and street; and the router will probably be good for upwards of five years."

Start is less of a hassle with shipping their modem to you. While Teksavvy does try hard with their service, it gets bothersome when you have many agents who have to go over the issue from the start.   With Start communications they all work in one place and know each other. I've even seen the CEO directly help people with problems.  The most important thing go with VDSL2+ not cable if your area has it. It is much more reliable, that was my experience anyways.   Teksavvy is not bad, the only problem I had with them is a long issue with my cable connection. They weren't able to fix it after multiple techs were sent out, and I got fed up and switched to DSL (with them since they had a promo).

Best regards, Jon    PS. The installation time frame depends on whether you go with DSL or Cable internet.

mississauga,3arn2j,jswift79,2,Tue Jun 23 00:26:39 2015 UTC,depends on how the company pays their employees.   Minimum wage to $18/hour.  maybe more

mississauga,3arzaf,yawaramin,3,Tue Jun 23 01:26:48 2015 UTC,"No.  If you get the day off moved, then there is no extra pay.    I believe unless you are a shift worker, you have to agree to move the day, and they can't move it if you don't want to.   We all know how that works though."

Also let a bit more air out of the tires for more grip. If you see a dude on a sky blue hard tail its probably me. Happy riding

Anyone can get a good workout at fit4less, but the variety of machines are limited. You would have to do more adjusting to your workout routine at fit4less verses goodlife or any other big gym. But for 20 dollars a month you can't go wrong, it has all the equipment you need to get a good workout. Free weights are king! Especially if your parents are just focusing on cardio."

Don't expect to have your own space to work out in as they can get quite packed.  I've been working out for several years, my short stint at fit4less (mcfit back in the day) was terrible. The place smells, there is a lack of decent equipment and it's overcrowded. Spend the extra cash and go to a real gym."

You get a card, fill it with credits, go to the right cage (speed) swipe card and I think you get 10 swings or so. The baseball cages use this plastic yellow ball. Its study but the outside is quite flexible. IIRC softball cage uses regular softballs.  Wait times aren't that bad, but then again my group is the only one using the cage 7. Softball might have a line though (1 or 2 people). A lot of people bring their own bats. It seems that they need you to wear a face mask but I remember signing a waiver so I could just wear a helmet. Now I don't think there are many alternatives; I can only think of centennial park and the baseball zone. I think centennial is pretty much the same, and baseball zone is for more hardcore training. I'm sure if you go before elementary schools end, the cages will be pretty much empty. Are they worth the prices? Not if you can just BP with your team. If you need extra work on your form that you can just nail down by repetitive hitting, then its a good choice."

mississauga,3ak97b,jddsa,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:41:27 2015 UTC,Yeah its fairly inexpensive to bat. They provide metal bats and helmets so bring your own gloves. IIRC they only open at 4 pm so usually there's a group but you're never waiting more than 5 minutes for a cage. They've got softball and hardball options at different speeds.

mississauga,3achwe,Aceken,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:54:12 2015 UTC,What they rent are the lines from your house to their servers. Those servers to the rest of the world they control. One example is how different ISPs have different latencies to different servers since they have different peering.

I would recommend you diversify those electives as much as possible, take a poli sci, economics, ccit, or english credit or anything that's different from your area of study. What most people find who aren't gunning for a particular graduate programme is that they have more interests in certain subjects other than the one they signed up for in Uni.   Mississauga as a city doesn't have a lot going on in the UTM area however celebration square is always alive and there's a website for whats happening. If you like going out with friends checkout insauga.com which has all the cool spots to check out in mississauga. Finally if you want to study at UTM stay the fuck away from the 4th floor of the library where the tables are. You will not get shit done, all the serious students can be found on the first floor (basement level) of the library.  In Uni you will be tempted to skip classes since mandatory attendance doesn't exist for lectures but don't do it. missing even one lecture can fuck you up. Take notes on your laptop for bio courses, take notes by hand for physics, math, and chemistry. Buy past tests whenever and wherever you can, some professors repeat questions, some change the numbers, some write completely new tests but it is still excellent practice. Join some extracurriculars. If you're interested in Med School ECSpeRT   is probably the ideal club since you get CPR training and experience in medical treatment."

mississauga,39p9rc,cupcakewin,2,Sat Jun 13 13:07:33 2015 UTC,"Renter here, i can tell you that my landlord couldn't wait for the lease to be over and sell the unit to cut loss. I was talking to him the other day, and he mentioned that bought multiple units as investment pre-build, and he lost a significant amount due to terrible building management with the old management company (it wasn't Duka Management until recent years).   As for myself, I have been looking for a new place to rent since March (my lease is over in Oct). The building itself is in poor condition, i lived here for about 5 years, and there are 3 MAJOR leakages in my unit and the ones above and below. Elevator trouble every day, i was once trap in the elevator with 5 other people for two and a half hours and security could get in touch with management or the maintenance people.  Instead of spending money to get it fix once and for all, they install the touch screen panel, not sure if they generate any ad revenue to help the building.  Also, if you go to the parking lot to check out the ceiling, you can see it is falling apart slowly, especially P2 and 3 level. I wouldn't be surprise if they double or triple the maintenance in the next few years to fix it.  Personally, i don't think Duka is doing a bad job compare to the previous management company, but i am not sure there are much they can do on the building itself giving the condition it is in without raising maintenance fee."

One of my Realtor friend show his client this building, and everything look good on the first time, on the second more detail viewing they found water mark on the wall, paint coming off, having trouble with closing/opening the main door, ant problem, and other minor stuff, nothing major. He was able to help his client get some discount from the seller, since this is an investment property, they buyer didn't care much and closed the deal. Fast forward few months, the buyer contacted my friend complaining how much he had to spent to fix the unit. Out of curiosity, my friend try to see who the developer is and he weren't able to, he said it seems like some junior developer just in for the quick money using cheap material.   But all these are based on my personal experience and what i heard from my friend. Maybe other residents have a better experience than me."

If you want to save money and get good call quality go for chatr 25 dollar plan.   If you want something that's better than wind (in my opinion), but not as good as a regular phone line, but at half the price give this a go.   You can try out voip.ms at home, and get a refund if you don't like it.   I use Zoiper, the best android sip program. If you use it, turn off echo cancellation."

mississauga,38lx0z,c74,3,Fri Jun 5 01:57:44 2015 UTC,Are you obligated to give your information if stopped?
mississauga,38lx0z,zparts,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:39:58 2015 UTC,"No, but the police generally rely on an intimidation factor, and the victim not knowing his rights under the law, in order to obtain compliance. They can basically say: give us all your information and we will leave you alone, otherwise we are going to really get in your face for the next few minutes.  The police are only required to tell someone about his rights if he is a suspect in an actual investigation. If they are just randomly harassing people without any good reason, they are not required to inform those people of their rights.  The legal justification for carding is that the police, as private citizens themselves, have the same right to approach and talk to people on the street as everyone else does. They are not using any special police powers, but rather are just engaging in natural human-to-human conversation in a public space, the same as would happen if you ran into a friend on the street and casually asked him to confirm his name, address, and birthday. Also beggars, Mormons, and those charity people, rely on this same legal principle.  Technically, you could call the police if a police officer were excessively harassing you (the same as if a crazy/homeless street person were excessively harassing/following you), but good luck with that."

mississauga,38iwli,iksworbeZ,3,Thu Jun 4 14:54:44 2015 UTC,"I live on the east end of mississauga, and there and most of the city/toronto I'm fine. I have some issues in erin mills where I'm there often enough to notice the coverage sucks.   Due to the type of spectrum they have, it will have problems penetrating denser materials. This means that thick concrete like you'd get in some buildings, basements, or the subway will kill your service or make it unusable.  The speeds don't bother me, but I switched off Rogers long enough ago that they didn't really offer anything better at the time. It's enough I don't have trouble steaming music or anything of the sort.   In Toronto and the surrounding area (i'm in Milton often) I also don't notice much in the way of problems.  Personally, I like them and their plans and know enough about their weak spots to deal with it for what I pay for. Given your concerns about indoor reception, its probably not for you, as would be any of the newer AWS spectrum providers."
mississauga,38iwli,Coan_Arcanius,2,Thu Jun 4 15:26:46 2015 UTC,"They don't actually offer LTE currently, and data can be slow due to congestion and spotty coverage.  But once you get a good signal it works quite fine.  Signal is usually fine in GTA but there are dead spots if you find yourself in an enclosed space.  Granted this happens for all other carriers as well.  Still, Rogers is way better when it comes to performance."
mississauga,38iwli,number8888,2,Thu Jun 4 15:49:10 2015 UTC,"They do not have an LTE network at all, however did purchase a huge block of spectrum in the most recent auction that should allow them to start building one out. How long that takes is anyone's guess.  I've been with WIND since November 2013 and I'm happy with them. I get pretty consistent signal strength at home (near Heartland) and at work (near Dundas/Mississauga Road), and very rarely have dead zones in the GTA--Guelph is now covered as well, where it wasn't only a year ago.  I'm willing to live with the lack of service outside urban centres for the amount of money I'm saving each month. With unlimited data and all the trimmings for $45 taxes-in, I really can't complain.  I always though unlimited data was a bit ""meh,"" until I had it. It truly does change how you use your phone, and I'm now easily in the 2GB per month range.  No contracts, either, so try it out. If you like it, stick with it, otherwise switch to someone else."
mississauga,38iwli,Funkagenda,2,Thu Jun 4 16:36:03 2015 UTC,"I've been with them almost from the start and have been mostly happy.  They have coverage now in about 90% of the places I go, including Windsor, Amherstburg, London and Barrie.  As others have said the data can be slow at times, though if you happen to be on WiFi, it's not much of a problem, and I've learned to live with it.  Streaming music etc. isn't much of an issue.  The place I have the most problem is Winston Churchill and 401, where there is a serious deadzone.  Outside is 50/50 for me if I get a signal, but as soon as I go into Wal-Mart, that signal disappears.  That aside, unlimited everything is awesome for $40, and I have had little problem with their service.  I have no intention of ever going back to any of the Big 3 unless I absolutely have to.  I'm on a pay-before plan with Wind and I know exactly what I'm getting each month, my bill stays the same, and I always keep a little extra sitting in my account in case I need to use my phone outside of a home zone.  I wish there was more coverage along the 401 down to Windsor, and I wish they'd fix that dead spot and a couple of others.  Overall happiness:  8/10"
mississauga,38iwli,Krinks1,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:41:41 2015 UTC,Hilarious that you mention 401/Winston Churchill. I have to let people know when I'm going to Wal-Mart and to expect a response later hahah.

mississauga,38iwli,kingscootybear,2,Thu Jun 4 23:05:50 2015 UTC,"They will get better.  They recently won some really desirable bandwidth at the last gov't auction.  It will eliminate the penetration issues they have but will take some time to integrate it into their network.  I like the fact that i have a $40 plan and pay $40,  a used to have a $35 plan with telus but somehow consistently paid over $70 for it. Their service isnt perfect but it'll get the job done"

mississauga,38iwli,munengr,2,Fri Jun 5 04:24:34 2015 UTC,"To summarize: YMMV.  I was on WIND since about a year after they launched up until a month ago. At first they were pretty spotty and low call quality but I had put up with it for a few years and it improved.   The problem is there are some areas where WIND is fine, and others where it's completely unusable. About half a year ago the network started getting worse and worse both at home and at work (Square One area) until it got to the point where my phone was a paper weight at home - I'd say a good 70-80% of the time during peak hours I'd have no reception at home, and if I did have reception calls would never come through. I finally gave up and switched to Koodo."
mississauga,38iwli,derpage,2,Thu Jun 4 15:05:24 2015 UTC,"I, too, switched to Koodo from WIND. I knew I made the right choice 30 seconds in, when a webpage I requested loaded in under 2 seconds, whereas I'd have been waiting at least a minute with wind."
mississauga,38iwli,mailto_devnull,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:08:50 2015 UTC,"I've been with wind for about a year now. Works fine for me in the Square one area. Works fine in downtown Toronto. No reception when you are underground. The 4G data is fairly fast if it can get a connection but I don't have any previous data experience so there is that. I use it primarily for spotify, reddit and textbased pages when I'm travelling on the go train. Other times its just for emergency stuff like directions or finding restaurants, basically nothing mission critical. I like it so far and I have never reached the data cap, not even close. But Wind is one of those providers that just isn't right for everyone. Being a person who uses texts almost exclusively, switching from my old provider Koodo, was a no brainer. Its like I got a free internet upgrade and the price remained the same."

mississauga,38iwli,noyoureadumpster,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:26:58 2015 UTC,"I just recently made a thread on this sub asking for suggestions for companies after I cancelled my Rogers plan. I decided to go with Wind because the value was too good to pass up and the no contract plan meant that I could try it for a few months and ultimately cancel if I didn't like it.  I'm only a week in and honestly I like it a lot so far. I do miss LTE but 3G is not so bad. I realized that I'm mostly around WIFI anyways so it wasn't much of a downgrade for me. As for the service going down, I have yet to experience it, granted it's only been a week. I've been to Brampton, around Mississauga and it's been smooth so far. I did lose data for a brief period when I was in a plaza in Brampton.   I'm going to see how the rest of the summer goes and then decide if I want to stay on or go after something like Fido or Koodo."
mississauga,38iwli,risktaker91,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:28:34 2015 UTC,"Avoid it, it infuriated me. The signal comes and goes randomly in the street, and forget it if you're in a condo. If you want you can get good internet, get bells data flex tab LTE for 20 a month (1 gb), then register with Voip.ms(1-3 dollars a month) and you'll have data + phone. You can get SMS with it too.  If you want to save even more money, go with tbaytel's 100 dollars a year for 20 gigs. Comes down to 9.4 dollars a month for Rogers internet (H+ not LTE), and with voip.ms it'll come to ~13 dollars for voice+data+sms. Tell me if you want to get the tbaytel, I'll tell you how, plus on how to set up voip.ms.  I found voip.ms better than wind at least."

I'd argue that it is as good or better than what you find in toronto... minus the trendy 'destination' factor that some restaurants have.  lacastile is sort of fitting the inquiry.  Arguably, it is one of the nicer restaurants in Mississauga, and it sort of is a higher price point and has notoriety.  I think it is fair to call it a destination restaurant - it is very good and has interesting decor with the piano going and such.  I mean, you can't go wrong, but some people might think it's amazing or tacky in a way.  I think it might be interesting for your friend.  michael's back door I like this place but not sure if it fits the bill in terms of impressive.  No doubt, the food is great... maybe too casual?  Anyways, worth a look being the food is very good.  ruth chris It's a chain... but damn, it's good for steaks.

mississauga,37px2p,catcatdogcat,0,Sat May 30 13:27:12 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, there are non-muslim events in the city that have halal food options? Thats great to know, which ones?   Haha, I don't think any Muslim event would serve non-halal meats, actually. To them, it would be like saying ""hi everyone, we have meat for sale that was raised with love and kindness, and killed quickly and humanely with the smallest amount of suffering possible. But just in case you don't like that, we have some booths selling meat that was tortured, pumped with steroids, poked, prodded, electrocuted, beat, doused in boiled water and (if they didn't die from all that stuff yet), killed.""   As someone who has eaten non-halal meat for most of my life, if I knew that halal meat was what it was, Id have eaten it all the time :)  That is to say, not all halal butchers who claim to be halal are doing it right; Ive seen many halal butchers who are very rough and unkind to their animals before slaughter :(.

mississauga,37gwhk,jswift79,3,Wed May 27 16:34:10 2015 UTC,Wind coverage is expanding slowly and now they are able to cover the entire QEW.  Most major urban centres in Canada should have adequate coverage.  So far I have no trouble getting a Wind signal when traveling in the GTA.  However signal quality is spotty and data can get quite slow.    It's also not LTE but from what I understand the slowness is more due to congestion.  From my experience Rogers is the best for coverage/speed.  Instead of Rogers you can go with Fido for better plans w/out contracts.  Wind still beats them all in terms of value though.
mississauga,37gwhk,number8888,2,Wed May 27 17:57:24 2015 UTC,This is my preference. Unfortunately they told me my iphone 5 is too old and not compatible. I need to get a new phone. :(

mississauga,37gwhk,Matt5639,4,Mon Jun 1 00:56:47 2015 UTC,"So cancelling your service was a pretty bad idea, generally you want a new carrier to do it for you so that they can take your number along with it. Having said that, prepare to have a new number!  Go with someone like Koodo, they ride on Bell's infrastructure (same as Telus) You can get decent plans from them, currently their promo plan is $45 a month, unlimited Canada wide, all the extras and a gig of data, not too shabby. On top of that you either buy a device, pay for it monthly on their ""tab"" or bring your own unlocked phone.  edit to answer your question about Wind, they are decent in the city and most of the GTA, however they only use a single data band for upload/download so their browsing experience is quite lacklustre and slow. For only a few bucks more a month you can have Canada wide coverage from Koodo/Virgin."

I will look into Koodo but the 1 gb is just not enough. With Wind, even though it may be slow, they give unlimited data which sounds really appealing. I just got back from a Wind store and unfortunately my iPhone 5 isn't compatible. It had to have been purchased after April 2013 and mine wasn't. So I need to look to trade in the phone first."
mississauga,37gwhk,kabikio,1 point,Wed May 27 17:43:29 2015 UTC,"Fair enough on the number,  You can add more data to the koodo plans, if you were planning on using the phone as a ""teather"" for all of you internet needs you will definitely be let down by Wind, they throttle you to death and having to share a single band for upload/download really kills the throughput/latency on their data connections.  I had a friend try this out, she was living in central Mississauga near Square One and was unable to maintain a reliable connection, browsing would sometimes work, things like netflix/vpn/streaming were out of the question however. The data connection was simply too unstable."

You can get SMS with it too, and it has a couple of SMS apps on android.  For more money: Fido has a 45 dollar unlimited everything excpet data. I think there's a 60  dollar one with 3 gb of data.  Avoid wind like the plague, the difference between bell's LTE and wind's data is night and day. PM if you need help with voip.ms"

For reference, I live 1km away from SQ1 and used to worked across the street from SQ1.   I got roaming several times while at HOME. Charged multiple times for roaming text messages etc. Inside sq1 although it says I have full bars and 4G I can't make any calls, receive calls, send/receive texts or use my data. Almost every time I needed to use data it didn't work and I've never left the GTA. In addition to that I lost service during heavy rain or snow fall and lost service randomly throughout the day when there shouldn't have been any issues. After checking my data usage for the last couple of months it never exceed more than 150MB because it was utterly useless.   Oh and every single person that spoke to me on the phone complained about choppy, terrible reception on my end.   I started thinking it might have been my phone but two of my coworkers who are with Wind had the same issues and as soon as I switched to Fido none of these issues carried over."

Teaching is one of the easiest and most affordable educational paths one can take. Litterally anyone that goes to University can be a teacher.   This has resulted in a saturation of unemployable teachers (U of T recently closed its teachers college to help address the problem). With the amazing salary, easy job and great pay, nobodys from every University were flocking to the occupation.  Look at the situation logically. We have an over supply of teachers.   There are almost 10,000 NEW TEACHERS every year graduating in Ontario. Do you really think that is sustainable?  EDIT:   In 2012, OVER 2/3 of teachers were not employed full time.  The solution to this problem is to kill the teachers union and hire teachers on individual contacts with competitive rates. That way we would have smaller class sizes! and HEY, aren't the teachers striking to reduce class sizes?

mississauga,37ea9s,cyb3rat,1 point,Wed May 27 05:14:42 2015 UTC,"I think that it is the very nature of the strike that was ruled illegal.  Seems quite murky.  Local strikes, which were seemingly centered around class sizes, were coordinated by the union at the provincial level, but what they were striking over was not clearly defined or communicated as being in conjunction with the negotiations at provincial level.  from the article   Fishbein took the opportunity to write in his decision that he heard little to no evidence of communication between the OSSTF and its members in the striking district about what the local issues are.   I kind of get the feeling while negotiations are going on at both local and regional levels, there is a disconnect on when each side wants, teachers and their representatives.  the illegality of it is from the local strike basically wanting something else than the provincial level reps wants.    Either way you look at it, this two tier collective bargaining technique is a mess."
mississauga,37ea9s,CommieCanuck,0,Wed May 27 14:03:14 2015 UTC,Basically they are striking over a contract with the school boards but the items they are striking about are outside the school boards control.

My teenaged son loved the time off... but he doesn't really grasp the consequences to him for being out of school for almost 6 weeks in Durham.  It's one of those things where i hope it doesn't bite him in the butt - but missing over a month of school was a thing where people redid the year if they were sick or whatnot back when i was in school.

Being a teacher is more rewarding, both mentally and financially, then being a lawyer. In what world does that make sense?"
mississauga,37ea9s,misselletee,5,Wed May 27 05:50:17 2015 UTC,"I ask in earnest, do you know what a teacher's job is? How many hours they truly work?  I have a few teacher friends. They don't make 94K a year (I'm not even sure if they make 50K a year). Granted, they haven't been teaching for 15+ years to bank that kind of money yet.  Teachers don't just work a 9-5 job to lecture kids about history and math. They plan lessons, or mark assignments or tests (often on their own time). They supervise extracurricular activities without being paid to do it. Often times, what they do is a thankless job.   From how I understand it, the teachers are striking because the class sizes are increasing while teacher's prep time is decreasing. In other words, the teachers are expected to do more work in less time. With this strike now being declared ""illegal"", they're upset that they can't freely express their dissatisfaction with the system. If class sizes increase, quality education suffers."
mississauga,37ea9s,TwistedxRainbow,2,Wed May 27 09:21:09 2015 UTC,"That's exactly it! My boyfriend's sister is a teacher and this is what she said. Not only are they also decreasing their prep time, but they are also going to dictate how to use that time for them as well."
mississauga,37ea9s,DotAClone,2,Wed May 27 11:30:33 2015 UTC,"Let me ask you a question, if being a teacher is so difficult, why the hell do we have more and more people registering to be teachers?   Why is there such a demand for such a thankless and difficult job?  I'll tell you why. Because there are so many people in cash cow degrees across canada. When reality sets in, they realize teaching is a goldmine and they try to get into it.  Again, if teachers have it so rough, why do we have so many people begging to get into teachers college and so many new teachers begging for work?  I'm tired of teacher apologists trying to make teaching out to the most difficult profession in the world. Its laughable."
mississauga,37ea9s,thehuxtable,0,Wed May 27 16:22:11 2015 UTC,"Who said it is the most difficult profession in the world? Its fine that you don't like teachers but I'm confused by your logic. Because it's a job that people want to do, it means they are overpaid? If the only reason you are getting into teaching is money then you are going to have a bad time.   In terms of the strike, if someone came into your workplace and was going to give you more work with less resources wouldn't that upset you?  And its fine to think that teachers are overpaid but Ontario consistently ranks very high in international rankings. I'd rather my tax dollars go to finding the best people, and a good salary helps do just that. We have an imperfect system but it is doing way more good than harm."
mississauga,37ea9s,DotAClone,0,Wed May 27 22:08:26 2015 UTC,"If teachers were being paid at market rate, we wouldn't have this over supply problem. Its as simple as that.   I'd rather my tax dollars go to finding the best people, and a good salary helps do just that.   You think people entering teachers college with a 3.0 are the best people?  http://www.nipissingu.ca/calendar/UG-studies/admissions-requirements/Pages/General-Undergraduate-Admission-Information.aspx#previousPostSec  Reality is that teaching has become a profession for those who cant do anything else.  The reputable teachers colleges (such as U of T, requiring a 3.5) are closing down to help adress the over supply of teachers."
mississauga,37ea9s,thehuxtable,1 point,Wed May 27 22:50:58 2015 UTC,But that's assuming that a high GPA = Good Teacher. I don't think it is necessarily the smartest people that make the best teachers. Of course knowledge of the material matters but teachers aren't teaching university level material in elementary or high school. They are teaching curriculum that they learned years ago.  I want teachers who care about their students both academically and socially. I want teachers who are patient and thoughtful and will work with families. GPA doesn't tell me who these people are.
mississauga,37ea9s,c74,-5,Wed May 27 23:15:11 2015 UTC,Sunshine list is $100k.... and look it up.    Strike is about losing jobs being higher class sizes = less teachers.  Care to talk about that reality?
mississauga,37ea9s,thehuxtable,5,Wed May 27 01:40:35 2015 UTC,"Just to be clear the Sunshine List is for public sector employees who make over 100k. This is not the 1%.   Yes, jobs play a part. Why wouldn't they? But don't you think larger class sizes would affect students?"
mississauga,37ea9s,c74,-1,Wed May 27 02:03:02 2015 UTC,"It's figurative obviously to point out that almost all teachers are striking when they are on the cusp of sunshiners.  larger class sizes obviously effect students.  just like computers effected students not needing encyclopedia sets.  The rational that class sizes should be static is just teachers protecting teachers jobs and their perception that it will (and it very well may) increase their workload.  One teacher makes well over most household income in the GTA.  Not saying that teachers should be poorly paid, but striking for effectively wages/workload when they are very generous compensated is laughable for most of the population."
mississauga,37ea9s,thehuxtable,1 point,Wed May 27 22:13:15 2015 UTC,"Doesn't the fact that they are so close to summer and still striking show how much these issues matter? If teachers were so focused on the money, shouldn't they have just gone along with the government's plan since no one is talking about lowering wages? After all, striking costs them money.  I would love to see where you are getting your data from. All teachers have gone through at least 5 years of post secondary education so I hope you are not comparing apples to oranges with your income data."
mississauga,37ea9s,c74,-1,Wed May 27 23:28:45 2015 UTC,"and most teachers remain as entry level positions.  ain't apple to apples to compare teachers to other occupations that require post secondary education.  Besides, most of those other professions don't rely on a monopoly negotiating base and get compensated on their market value.  Teachers get paid based on seniority of all things... /facepalm"
mississauga,37ea9s,thehuxtable,1 point,Thu May 28 00:19:00 2015 UTC,"Just to be clear then you also feel the same way about police officers, firefighters, paramedics, doctors and nurses? All professions where most ""remain as entry level positions"". In the private sector, employees are also compensated based on seniority, it just isn't on a predetermined salary grid. I agree that skill should be rewarded and not just seniority, but this happens throughout both the private and public sector."
mississauga,37ea9s,Chyrch,0,Thu May 28 01:36:23 2015 UTC,"The average is about 50k, which is around the average for all Canadian workers. There are certainly some teachers who make much more, but not as many as people seem to believe."

mississauga,37bzfx,InspectorVII,3,Tue May 26 19:17:23 2015 UTC,"Are these your first pair of hiking boots?  What kind of hiking are you planning on doing?  If you're just doing short day trips (10-15 km max, especially on less strenuous trails like in conservation areas) then you can probably get away with something that's more like a hiking shoe.  You'll save some money that way, since boots that offer more ankle support (necessary if you plan on going >15km in a day) are more expensive.  If you plan on doing those kinds of distances or more, particularly on a more strenuous trail, like the bruce trail, you will need the ankle support and the money will be worth every penny.  As for where to buy, you might pay an extra 10-20 bucks at MEC, but their exchange policy is fantastic - you can take them back for ANY reason, they will refund or exchange.  That is really, truly worth it.  You don't really know how your feet will react to a pair of shoes/boots until you get out there and try them - what fits in the store and feels fine on their little ramp may not work in practice.  Source:  I hike a lot!  It's actually a really great, and inexpensive hobby - your boots are your biggest necessary expense, so make sure you get a good pair that fit you well."

If you suffer from blisters, pick yourself up a pair of gobi poly liners - you wear these under your thick socks.  They stop your feet from rubbing up against things.  They've changed my life, no word of a lie."

In both shots your horizons aren't level and it's distracting. In the first shot the crosswalk frames the shot nicely but the top may need a bit more room to breathe. In the 2nd shot there's nothing going on in the bottom of the frame; most landscape shots look good if there's a near/middle/far component.  Crop the foreground more."

mississauga,3776l6,EpsilonSteve,1 point,Mon May 25 18:38:56 2015 UTC,Cynicalbrownie gave a pretty succinct answer. Condos are also difficult to refinance and the supple for condos are extremely high while detached homes are the most sought after (though still great supply for those in Mississauga).  However having a home is more than just a financial investment it also fills a need and emotional component as well.

mississauga,3776l6,EpsilonSteve,1 point,Mon May 25 14:20:39 2015 UTC,I don't know how you've come up with your number. Did it appreciate by 80K from when you first bought it?  Edit: I didn't downvote you
mississauga,3776l6,love_10_min_snooze,1 point,Fri May 29 14:43:21 2015 UTC,That's what I was left with on my bank account after selling the condo.  Now I invested that money into another condo.
mississauga,3776l6,EpsilonSteve,1 point,Fri May 29 14:58:46 2015 UTC,"So that's 80K before you subtract how much you contributed for condo fees. Assuming 400 bucks a month or 4800 a year after 8 years - 36,400.  Your actual profit would be 43,600.  That is not a comparatively significant return considering the location and the length of time of ownership.  Of course as investment vehicles, condos can be rented out at a higher price than houses rent rooms. Best of luck to you venture."

mississauga,36o2ik,Jeff146,5,Wed May 20 20:07:01 2015 UTC,"I'm actually a volunteer at Carassauga this year. Carassauga, imo is amazing. It seems like the selling point is the food (try the Greek honey balls - a m a z i n g). There are 28 pavilions this year, many of them in the Hershey Centre. They all have their own individual entertainment, which can range from dances to music, etc. Some pavilions also showcase their cultural attire and stuff like that. It's a pretty great time :) 10/10 would recommend. Plus transit is free with the passport, which is $10 right now."
mississauga,36o2ik,sendmeyourfishsticks,5,Thu May 21 00:47:54 2015 UTC,"Personally I think it's something cool to do once. The passport will grant you entry into the different pavilions and free transportation between the pavilions. If you like to learn about cultures, it's pretty cool. Portuguese pavilion is the best. Great food and entertainment.(bias opinion because I'm Portuguese, lol)."
mississauga,36o2ik,ricas77,4,Wed May 20 22:09:27 2015 UTC,"Hey Jeff! Radha here, Carassauga pre-show host and judge.   And yes, I am a lurker.   I went to Carassauga in 07/08, and didn't go back until 2013. I also originally said, ""well, why bother?"" I think you should go. First of all, it is really inexpensive and includes free transport. So, on a money thing, it makes sense. And toonie tastes tend to become filling if you go to many pavilions. I tested this theory last year.   So, yes, food variety is good.  But the reason why I like it: many pavilions really do the best they can to showcase and immerse you in the best of their culture. If you approach a volunteer or organizer and inquire about the culture, people really go out of their way for you.   Also, the amount of $$$ that go into these pavilions is surreal.   Go to Lebanon for a photo dressed up as royalty. Check out the Egyptian pharaoh parade this year, not sure if the camel is coming back. Iraq has great artwork & calligraphy. Pakistan has serene and sincerely beautiful music. Cyprus has men jumping up and down - the performances are highly entertaining. Ireland has some of the top dancers from North America on stage. Italy has gone back to the historic roots with their setup this year. Serbia has delicious bourbon. Thailand and Indonesia have intricate story-telling dancing. The martial art sets at China is dynamic. Portugal always flies in artisans to showcase different regions. Brazil has built a Coca Cabana esplanade this year. Poland turns into a massive dance floor jam-session at night. There is never a  break at Korea, and there is a lively big band at Malta. Go to Hawaii for advanced hula dancing. Latin America is a massive showcase. I can go on - there is still Vietnam, Croatia, Philippines, Macedonia, India, Turkey, S. Sudan, the continent of Africa, the Caribbean (new team) and a few more.   Anyway, yes, go with a friend. It is a thoroughly enjoyable weekend. Let me know if you have questions.  Edit: my highlight reel above does not reflect the pavilions. It is just a list of cool 'things' that I have/am hoping to experience."

mississauga,36o2ik,atioxx,0,Thu May 21 20:30:47 2015 UTC,"I haven't been for a whole year in Canada and I come from Lebanon. Lebanon does not portrait royalty only, it can be on the list but it doesn't reflect our culture. I will probably have to go see it myself, because I heard people in Canada think of Lebanese people as rich and all about party. While this is mainly true since this is what we base our economy on nowadays, but this image kills our culture and beautiful heritage. I can be biased now since I am basing this to the word ""royalty,"" while others represent themselves truthfully.  When and where is it? And thanks for your efforts."
mississauga,36o2ik,radhatailor,1 point,Thu May 21 17:49:17 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I should clarify then! They have created a photo of station with pillows, tapestry and traditional garb for a cute photo op, with tea and sweets. It was just a really nice way to have some interaction and a piece of memorabilia. Royalty, in itself, is by far not the representation you see at the pavilion. The actual pavilion in itself is very country-oriented and extremely busy. Last year, they hand painted the entire backdrop of the stage of the Lebanese landscape. Every very half hour, there was a full story presented on stage through dancing, with corresponding screens to translate the text into English.   There was also traditional calligraphy so you could have your name written, they had booths that showcased some of the arts and others that showed major exports or items from the country.   Hershey's centre. I think you will enjoy it. The organizers really put their hearts and passions into the pavilion."
mississauga,36o2ik,lilylemony,0,Thu May 21 18:10:27 2015 UTC,"I went for the first time since I was 17 and it was pretty fun. Some of the pavilions go to more trouble than others, so some are lame and some are awesome. I liked that everything was pretty centralized at the Hershey Arena, but the outside area left me thinking, ""Is that it?"" I really enjoyed the three pavilions inside the hockey arenas - India, Philippines, and Lebanon. Really well done and a lot to see and do. The food at the India pavilion was heavenly, too. But I adore Indian food, so I'm a bit biased.  I was kind of bummed the whole thing opened so late (1pm), but I was there super early, so I got a plum parking space. For $12 over three days, you can't beat it. I'm going to probably hit the ""offsite"" pavilions like Poland tomorrow if I have time."

mississauga,36dc4i,LoveJustHate,6,Mon May 18 14:08:07 2015 UTC,"You don't want a Mazda for less than 6k.  It will be a rust bucket.  (Mazdas also = higher insurance than many other types of cars for young people, too)  In fact, your expectations are frankly a little unrealistic. A car with less than 100,000 km is probably going to run you more than 6k just because it's probably not that old.  Most people put 15 - 20k km on their cars per year... so you do the math.  A ~2005 Toyota Echo is probably about right.  I found a couple on Autotrader under 6k with just over 100,000km.  ~2005 Honda Civic, same thing  Hyundai Accent starts out a lot cheaper than either of those cars new, so you can get a newer one if that's what you're into for the same money - something around a 2010 should be possible.  That's where I'd put my money, personally.  In fact, that's actually precisely what I did in 2011 when I bought a 2009 Accent.  My 09 Accent had 28,000 km when I bought it and I'm up to 120,000 now.  So your ""under 100,000 km"" is pretty unreasonable.  I'm taking mine to 500,000 though.  If you take care of a car, it'll keep going.  PS if you learn to drive manual, you can save a lot.  Automatic transmission = $$$$"

If you can get good grades your school should give you scholarships. However, A typical university year is about ~$10000. You get 4 months off of school and through this you can make about $5000. Even more if you have full time work.   The only reason Im saying this is because in a year, trust me because ihave friends who have taken a year off of school. They get lazy, dont want to work much and most of them dropped out of half their classes because they couldn't take it.  The material is fresh in your head, spend your two months relaxing and work through school."

The Italians Albertino Mussato and Francesco Petrarca were the first to be crowned poets laureate after the classical age,[citation needed] respectively in 1315 and 1342. In Britain, the term dates from the appointment of Bernard André by Henry VII of England. In modern times, the title may also be conferred by an organization such as the Poetry Foundation, which has a designated Children's Poet Laureate.[1] Other examples are the Pikes Peak Poet Laureate,[2] which is designated by a ""Presenting Partners"" group from within the community; the Minnesota Poet Laureate chosen by the League of Minnesota Poets (est. 1934);[3] the Northampton Poet Laureate[4] chosen by the Northampton Arts Council,[5] and the Martha's Vineyard Poet Laureate chosen by ten judges representing the Martha's Vineyard Poetry Society.

It is your duty to your new home to integrate yourself into the society you've chosen to live in, neither forcibly assimilate to it, nor seclude yourself from it.""

The vast majority of students are just trying to pass the class during summer school, and therefore teachers tend to boost the grades of students who appear even remotely interested in the subject.

mississauga,35brim,DotAClone,1 point,Fri May 8 20:27:04 2015 UTC,Is this a serious question ?
mississauga,35brim,cykloid,-2,Fri May 8 20:49:07 2015 UTC,"Well... yes it is.  Is this targeted towards kids, people without cars? It seems fun, but I'm not sure where to get started and how it compares to my current hobby (of going tracking).  EDIT:  RC racing isn't something everyone knows about. I only see kids using RC cars. So I'm wondering who the targeted audience is."
mississauga,35brim,DotAClone,1 point,Fri May 8 20:58:35 2015 UTC,"As an owner of both, I can tell you owning a race car / street car can cost upwards of 50K+. Going to mosport takes time, money, equipment, tires, fluids etc. RC Cars are cheaper and allow for being competitive. As someone who has done both I can tell you that I feel my money goes farther when rc'ing. Its also nice to include your kids and other buddies.  Most of the people racing competitively are adults but there are kids that clean up."

Most people hate on people who get welfare because they are getting a handout for doing absolutely nothing. Yeah, it might only be $600 a month, but it's still $600 a month for doing nothing. I had to support myself on $800 a month while going to school except I had to work 20 hours a week to get that $800. Of course it's not supposed to provide for all your living costs, because then you'd never feel the need to get off Ontario Works! If you are on Ontario Works, you shouldn't be complaining you're not getting enough money to live, it's supposed to be TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE while you look for a job!

mississauga,356hta,dundreggen,0,Thu May 7 17:12:39 2015 UTC,"I havent outright heard anyone say that either - but this meme being circulated on peoples social networks clearly demonstrated that some people believe it  To correct what you said, most people actually hate on people receiving welfare because they are under the MISCONCEPTION that its money for nothing. You are very naive to the structure of the system, if you really think you get it for doing literally 'nothing'.   First, you have to sell off anything and everything you may have that is of any worth, before you can even be considered. Then you have to allow them to invade on your personal bank accounts, past work records and explain to them in detail why you arent able to get work - for some, like me, its that we are awaiting approval by ODSP; for others, its that they somehow cant get daycare and thus have to be at home, as single parents; for some its that they are still injured and cant work, but their E.I. ran out, and they dont qualify for ODSP; for others its that they just cant get hired - no matter how many jobs they try to apply to... and for others still, its that there is literally no work available in their area - there are many, many legitimate reasons for people to need to seek the help of O.W.  Unless someone is in the situation of being disables and waiting on ODSP, they have a significant number of requirements to fill in order to remain eligible for help each month. They must be spending 40 hours each week volunteering, and providing proof that they are spending at least 40 hours or more, each week, looking for work. Also, O.W. frequently connects people with temp positions (which dont last, but are something anyway) and when they tell recipients about the position, they have no choice but to accept it- because if they dont, they will be cut off. They will also cut you off at pretty much ANY point if they find a little error in your paperwork  And no matter what reason you're on assistance, you have to provide them with regular bank statements and report every dime you get, outside of what they provide (example - monetary gifts for birthdays) even though they are actually aware they dont provide enough to live on  Of course IT SHOULD provide enough for someones basic living costs, because there are very few recipients who are on the system by choice - we have no other options - absolutely NO OTHER WAY TO SURVIVE... and the moment someone ends up homeless, they are officially screwed to ever be able to even fathom getting back on their feet, because O.W. requires you to have an address, in order to be a recipient (thats why there are so many homeless people, not getting help)  Yes, it is supposed to be temporary, and hence them not provided thousands and thousands of dollars to each person (extra spending money isnt a thing)... but meeting the basic expenses of someone who has to face the same inflated prices as everyone else, isnt an unreasonable request. If anyone is ever expected to be able to get back to work, they need to be able to keep up with their health - and thats only possible with proper food and shelter. Trying to argue otherwise is just naive to what the human body needs to operate properly  I was also slaving away trying to pay for textbooks, back when I was in school - only I was at a call center, getting verbally abused every couple minutes instead. Its not right that anyone is made to slave at any job, or that any student is made to pay for their education. If you are aware of these things being so unpleasant, then you should be taking steps to support change in these areas, rather then getting mad because you think other people are getting free money, while you slave - if you are suffering, so is everyone else having to slave those jobs too; and no one should have to do that. The only way this will ever be recognized is if people like yourself speak up and finally say NO! I WONT STAND FOR THIS SYSTEM ANY LONGER!... but if everyone just keeps telling everyone that suffering is the name of the game, then thats the way its going to stay...  So no, Im not happy to have to live off the few pennies assistance provides - its not free - its at the price of my dignity and mental health (even though I am actually in therapy and trying to improve in that area). And even though Im awaiting disability, I still have to regularly fill out paperwork for O.W. too - the whole process is excessively invasive and thus, no reasonable person would ever be thankful to have to use it... especially with people like you looking down on us and thinking ill of us for needing help."

I understand it's a final resort for a lot of people but the fact is the government already spends a ton on social welfare and it can only afford so much before taxes have to increase. I can't even begin to understand how tough life on welfare must be but we've all struggled in our own way. Why aren't you focusing more on how difficult it is to get off OW rather than how uncomfortable it is living on it? Isn't that the ultimate goal, to not require assistance? I appreciate the effort you put into your video and responses btw."
mississauga,356hta,InspectorVII,-1,Thu May 7 20:27:39 2015 UTC,"Well, if its function is to help people get by until they can get a job again, than no, it hasnt served it - because it causes people to go hungry, thus slowly diminishing their health and reducing their employability - 'getting by' isnt supposed to mean suffering  Further, all of the social stigmas surrounding anyone who has to resort to assistance can be very damaging to a persons mental health... I certainly appreciate that we have any form of assistance at all - dont get me wrong - but in our modern society, its not unreasonable to ask for help with your basic needs when unemployed (which again, they dont provide enough for)  Further, the government actually only spends a fraction of overall tax dollars on social assistance programs - WAY more is wasted in unnecessary administration and paying people to push bills like C-51, that no one wants  And I am trying to focus on how hard it is to get off O.W., by bringing awareness to how awful it is to live on it - people end up resorting to it because they cant get work, for one reason or another - so how are they supposed to remain employable, and thus get off of the system, if they're being made hungry and mentally ill in the process? If you watch the video I linked, (about half way through the one in this thread), called Poor No More, they explain how, once you are low enough to have to resort to O.W., the structure of the system keeps a lot of people that low and makes it near impossible to get back up... Its not about simple discomforts like not being able to afford to go to the movies once in a while - its about not being able to meet your basic grocery bill each month - how are you supposed to get a job when you just keep getting sicker and sicker? Or what if theres no work in your area? They dont provide help to move, or for any extra expenses like that.  Im young, and I know I can personally overcome the situation I currently face, but I also know that I would be able to overcome it a lot faster, and thus, become a contributing citizen a lot sooner, if I wasnt being stressed by my financial situation, while also trying to heal  And with this, I've become aware that there are a lot of recipients like me, and worse even, that would be able to support themselves a lot sooner, if they werent being forced into illness, while also being at a low point in life"

The thing is that each theatre only has the tickets for its own showings in its system, so cineplex Courtney Park has no idea what tickets there are for cineplex Winston Churchill, so we can't refund the tickets, since we don't know that they've been sold (if you understand what I mean). Your best bet is to go to the theatre during a time when it's not as busy, and ask for a refund on tickets that were never used and the box office guys should be able to handle you properly.

mississauga,353yjf,danosmanca,-1,Thu May 7 02:06:16 2015 UTC,"At any GO station just ask the teller to set one up for you.  If you're commuting between Cooksville and Union, it'll let you just tap on once at Cooksville and you'll be charged to Union and vice-versa.  Also, if you're a student or senior you can also get a discount."
mississauga,353yjf,VallisAurea,1 point,Thu May 7 02:48:47 2015 UTC,"I take this same route, so I can give you a couple options.   First off, if you are only taking the Milton train between Cooksville and Union, set-up the default trip with a Go station employee. If you are a student, show your student card to save more.   So depending on where you live, there are a few options.   There is a bus that goes directly from Square One bus terminal (not sure of the terminal #) to Cooksville (#91 South) and this will deduct your normal fare for using Miway. However, when you tap for the GO, the rate will be reduced such that you pay full price for the GO trip ($5.30 for you it sounds like) and $0.85 for the co-fare on the Miway. Therefore, if you were to add up the total, it should equate to $6.15. You can do the reverse heading from union so you will be spending $12.30/day.   There is an App for both Go transit and Mississauga bus schedules available on the apple store or Google Play store (GO ANDROID!)  I use a different bus (#28 south) from Rathburn and Confederation that gets me to Hillcrest and I make the short walk from there. This is another option for you depending on where you reside or what bus you come in on.  If you set up the default trip, you ONLY have to tap on before you get on the train, not after. For the Miway, you only tap once you get on the bus (unless the presto service is not working which seems to happen quite frequently). For the GO Bus, regardless if you have your default trip set-up or not, you always tap on and off when you board and exit the bus respectively. Let me know if you have any questions."
mississauga,353yjf,iMiiTH,-1,Fri May 8 14:57:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input.   I am only concerned with the GO on my way back, because I spend my time around square one after work.   So my route is usually Union > Cooksville > SquareOne (All Go). Now at Union, I tap on and then tap off at Cooksville on my way out. Then on the bus I tap on and off. This ends up in me paying $5.30, just like a single fare from Bay to Square One in the Go Bus.  Yesterday, I tried not taping off after the train as suggested by other discussions on here. The Go bus, took away $11.30 Auto Adjustment Missed Tap off and charged me again for $5.30.  When I tapped off the bus, I had -$0.53 returned. So one way trip reduced my balance from $22.44 to $6.37 on final tap off.  By definition:    An Auto Missed Tap Off Adjustment is the payment of your Missed Tap Off trip, paid when you tap on for your next trip. This charge, plus the fare for your next trip, will be deducted from your card balance when you tap on. Note that this will happen automatically only when you tap on with the same service provider as your Missed Tap Off trip.   Total rip off.  Edit, missed this part:   If you set your default train trip from Union to Cooksville, you should only need to tap once, before you get on."
mississauga,353yjf,VallisAurea,-1,Fri May 8 15:23:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's a transfer policy on the GO (that I'm aware of, anyway), so you're paying two fares - one for the train, and one for the bus. If you set your default train trip from Union to Cooksville, you should only need to tap once, before you get on. It'll automatically deduct the right amount on that one tap. With the bus, you tap off when exiting, and it should adjust the fare based on distance travelled.  Also, it's definitely less expensive to take a miway bus to Square One, as there is a reduced fare when transferring from a GO station - I think it's $0.85 right now.  There is also a bus that goes straight to Square One from the Union bus terminal on Bay St., this may be another option for you."
mississauga,353yjf,bumheadducky,0,Wed May 6 22:58:40 2015 UTC,"There is a transfer policy for GO. I took this from here:  Transfers  You have a 3 hour travel window to complete your GO trip.

Remember, transfers between GO Transit and other participating systems must also occur within 3 hours of the start of your GO trip."

For me it didn't make a difference if it was a class size of 24 or 34, it gets impersonal after around 15 anyways. The majority of teachers wouldn't tailor their teaching to be individualized anyways even with smaller classes. Their real reason is that with 33+ kids, that have to work a bit harder. Well toug, there are teachers in other countries with classrooms much bigger than that but the kids are often hard-working/academically focused and get the job done.  Arguing for higher wages I can accept but it's a changing world so stop with the class size bs. There will always be kids that don't learn in a traditional classroom and a smaller class size won't stop that."

mississauga,34t6gf,cyb3rat,4,Mon May 4 13:14:37 2015 UTC,"It appears to be in concert with other school boards in the province. mostly in relation to  a change in collective bargaining this year.    Quoting this article:    Now all issues involving money – including wages, benefits, class sizes and preparatory time – are hashed out by the Ministry of Education, the school boards’ umbrella associations and union leaders at a “central” table, leaving issues like job assessments and working conditions for local talks.  The chairs of the two Ontario school boards already facing high-school strikes say the changes have left them scant room to manoeuvre.  The OSSTF, meanwhile, has said in the past that negotiations with those boards were sluggish and lacking in respect, prompting them to abandon negotiations.   Now that all negotiation is happening at the provinces level, and local boards are having trouble both responding and communicating with the bargaining sides, the OSSTF is calling for strikes all over Ontario to get attention to the matter.  From the article:   potential strike targets are Halton, Waterloo, Ottawa and Lakehead, which includes Thunder Bay."
mississauga,34t6gf,Dilettante,1 point,Mon May 4 13:35:19 2015 UTC,"New contract being negotiated. The province would like to have larger class sizes, more on calls for teachers, more work for librarians, guidance counselors and spec ed teachers every day, and the ability to assign teachers to unpaid mandatory work after school and on weekends. The result would let the province save money, since they could hire fewer supply teachers, librarians, etc. However, it would also make working conditions a lot worse for teachers - and the province isn't leaving any room for compromise or negotiation."

I'd rather students not lose months of education as a bargaining pawn for an already powerful union - it's not like Ontario teachers are poorly compensated or lacking in benefits either.
mississauga,34t6gf,SexBobomb,1 point,Tue May 5 15:36:52 2015 UTC,"Pay and benefits are not at the forefront of the debate here. Keeping class sizes at levels where students can excel, allowing teachers the few minutes they currently get to prepare materials and mark to remain, allowing teachers to be hired based on ability instead of seniority, keeping teachers in charge of evaluating how their students are performing."
mississauga,34t6gf,c74,-1,Tue May 5 15:47:37 2015 UTC,Based on ability over seniority is the opposite of any action the teacher's union has ever taken and  teachers are already guaranteed 8 hours of prep time per ten days. I haven't seen anything conclusive indicating there are any proposed changes to student evaluation or class sizes however I'll be first to admit that isn't something I've investigated yet as I assumed that wasn't something that the union would hold governance over
mississauga,34t6gf,al57115,-1,Tue May 5 15:59:35 2015 UTC,"And the teachers are taking on the Wynee Liberals who have no more money than the Hudak cpc's who lost in admirable fashion by saying they were going to take on the payroll problem for public servants.  My money is on that this turns into a 'save' a couple million bucks in salaries for a couple weeks to just give it all back in raises... but i suspect this will take the public schools to jump on ship being effectively they will become a defunct daycare service.  Interestingly enough, I was listening to talk radio today and they said the 1% of families in the GTA make approx. $200k per year in the context of housing prices.  If 2 teachers were married they'd make approx $180k (7 or so years of seniority) making them damn close to being the 1% that is now on strike... it is mind numbingly unbelievable to think these people are on strike."
mississauga,34t6gf,c74,2,Tue May 5 01:34:20 2015 UTC,"If two teachers were married? What kind of logic is that? So if teachers marry other teachers, they will be fine?  Wow..maybe you need to go Back to school.."
mississauga,34t6gf,EGOP,3,Tue May 5 16:02:30 2015 UTC,"you don't understand the logic that teachers salary make them very close to being considered the 1%?  How about GTA medium income per family being $71,210 in 2012.  So, one unionized public sector teacher with less than 10 years experience makes significantly more than the median of families in Toronto.  Does that drive home the fact that the teachers are already extremely very well paid or do you think they should be striking because the tax payers should pay more?  I don't think most people understand how well paid teachers are in Ontario.  Or would you support a system like they did in the auto industry with new teachers making significantly less because for years and years the unions forced the wages to asinine/unaffordable wages for current union mmbers?  Personally, I think stopping the crazy train of giving them more money every year is the answer... but time will tell.  If we learn from history, they'll get their unfair/inequitable raise right across the board."
mississauga,34t6gf,c74,2,Tue May 5 22:32:10 2015 UTC,"You're confusing two different sets of data. You're looking at incomes across all education levels and professions and then comparing that to a teacher's salary to try and make your point look better.  Is it fair to compare a teacher who, in general, has multiple degree programs completed, specializations completed, and a professional designation to the salary of someone who dropped out of high school and works minimum wage?  Usually when you make comparisons, you compare like vs like unless you're trying to pull the wool over peoples' eyes.  Compare the salary of a new teacher to others that are new in their industry and are at the same level of education. Then compare how salaries increase over time for increased experience for those same like-educated groups.  What you'll find is that teachers are middle of the road for income starting off and then fall behind over time. Teacher's pay structure is capped after 10 years of seniority. Say, for a teacher who started at 25, their salary stays the same once they hit 35 (other than negotiated cost of living increases through their union) until they retire.  For someone who is not a teacher but has a university level education and a professional designation, their salary will continue to increase significantly until they retire.  Look up the census data for real facts instead of assumptions and smoke and mirrors, I'll get you started:  http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/as-sa/99-014-x/99-014-x2011003_2-eng.cfm  http://www4.hrsdc.gc.ca/.3ndic.1t.4r@-eng.jsp?iid=54  http://www.library.carleton.ca/sites/default/files/find/data/surveys/pdf_files/Price-of-Knowledge_4th-edition_2009-11_chapter-1_en.pdf"
mississauga,34t6gf,al57115,1 point,Wed May 6 10:29:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, pointing to that data just looks at the community in general... totally agree it doesn't take into account other factors such as retired people, single income families, people on welfare, unemployed etc.  But, I think it is a good food for thought for many people who seem to think teachers are part of the overworked middle class.  Clearly they are not.  I'd agree entry level salary is pretty much par for the course or if anything lowish in my mind.  I wouldn't bat an eyelid if they bumped it say 50k which is sort of where you need to be if you are single, student loans, renting an apartment and needing a car to get to work.  However, unlike most other professional disciplines, most teachers stay at 'entry level' jobs through their career.  The concept that the classroom teacher 'peak' salary doesn't go anywhere after 10 years makes sense to me on many levels because their primary job does not change.  If they decide to become principals or work their way up in the school board of course they get more compensation like other professional designations.  But if you are a entry level engineer and do not have more responsibilities than you effectively had after your first year... I doubt you'd ever get close to the raises, job security etc the teachers have in spades today.  That is just the nature of any professional discipline if you do not pursue advancement.  Also, the obvious thing is the teachers who do pursue advancement and get higher salaries and more responsibilities are not considered in that 'data'.  You can't expect to be a street beat police officer for life and expect to get paid like a inspector."
mississauga,34t6gf,c74,2,Wed May 6 23:07:19 2015 UTC,"Ok..so the teacher's salary is in line with other public sector workers who work the average 9-5 work week yet they sometime have to go far beyond the job description than say a Postal worker or an office worker in any of the government ministries (ie Driver Licencing office...passport office.....) Who takes care of your kids when you are at work? Who coaches the sports teams that your kids are more interested in than classes? Did you know that extra curricular activities are largely Volunteer? Teachers also act as an ear that some students can talk to because they are too afraid to talk to their parents. All this for a starting salary of about $45,000 per year before taxes. I agree, after 10 years of service, the salary get more but again, it's commensurate with any other Government sector Worker. Want to get really mad?

mississauga,34t6gf,al57115,2,Tue May 5 23:17:01 2015 UTC,I think you are either a teacher or choose to ignore the glaring reality that teachers are extremely well paid.  Do you think in the private sector that salary jobs are 9-5?  Do you think that volunteering to coach my kids sport teams pays lots of money?  or volunteering on the condo board?  What planet are you commenting from?  And then comparing the extremely generously paid teachers to another public sector union with seemingly no responsibility to the taxpayer... wat?  Pointing out more grievous abuses of public sector unions does not in anyway reduce the ridiculous compensation they currently receive... let alone the jaw dropping arrogance to actually go on strike for more money.  It is a farce.
mississauga,34t6gf,c74,3,Tue May 5 23:41:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not a teacher but I respect them. . I don't know what your standard for ""extremely"" well paid is but I don't believe that $45,000 starting salary is a what you would call extreme. I don't know what axe you have to grind against teachers but I am guessing that there is somthing there. So what do you think is fair for a teacher's pay? Do you agree that a teacher is worth less than a ticket collector at the TTC? Because some of them make more than teachers. Or how about the fact that the teachers help your kids get into university? Or the fact that they provide a safe enviroment for your kids to develop and learn? And being on your condo board is your choice just the same as coaching yours kid's sports teams. But teachers do it because they want to not becaue they have to. Oh and I was using the 9-5 as a refrence to the fact that teachers generally work more hours and take work home with them wth regards to marking and preparing material for the next day. I see that we will never agree because you have such a deep seeded hatred of teachers and I refuse to keep feeding an obvious troll."

They rarely compensate for personal injuries and I don't think they would compensate at all for damage to used goods in unknown condition prior to the incident.  However, if you feel that you have a legitimate claim, you would file the claim to the City of Mississauga,  procedures listed on the city's website:  http://www.mississauga.ca/portal/residents/fileaclaim"
mississauga,34vnju,pelito,2,Tue May 5 13:23:21 2015 UTC,"my wife' best friend's mom's coat got caught when the door closed a she exited. she got dragged and the passengers yelled for the driver to stop. when it did, she got thrown forward and broke a leg.  she was hospitalized for a week or 2.  miway has no record of the incident therefore not claiming any responsibility."

mississauga,34vnju,caretotry_theseagain,-1,Tue May 5 19:36:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your comment. The driver didn't stop, he accelerated quickly and hopped a curb to avoid a red light. I agree it'll be a challenge, but I'm a student and don't have extra money, so I'm gonna try anyway."
mississauga,34vnju,caretotry_theseagain,-6,Tue May 5 14:19:04 2015 UTC,"ugh people like you give students a bad name. I bet you're american too, courtmongerers... I'm sure you can think of better ways to spend your time rather than fuss over trying to fight with public transit because you aren't paying attention inside a 15+ton vehicle that can move up to 110kph. I highly doubt the stress and time wasted is worth the same monetary value as a cracked screen. Just accept the accident and move on. Not to mention, high end phones are the ones with breakable glass screens. All the low end sick potato-phones have an uncrackable plastic type glass, sit on it all you like, never breaks. Go to wind and pick a 110$ phone and be done with it.   Bet it's an iphone too you dropped."
mississauga,34vnju,EpsilonSteve,-1,Tue May 5 19:12:37 2015 UTC,"So you're saying that I, a fare paying passenger who doesn't blast ghetto ass music, who gives up his seat for seniors, thanks the driver, and helps other passengers give students a bad name? Not those who sneak on without paying, take up seats by laying down and keeping their bags up, abuse the drivers, disturb other passengers? Give me a fucking break"
mississauga,34vnju,caretotry_theseagain,-1,Wed May 6 13:28:31 2015 UTC,"see, your fault here lies on the fact that you assume it takes one kind of person to do ALL those things. It doesn't. It takes many people do do all those things. You are just one shitty person who's doing one shitty thing, well, two now. Thanks for further proving my point though!  I wonder what Whitey MciPhone here would call "" blasting ghetto ass music"" in the first place.. If something bothers you do something about it. If you have a nice tone and use those fandangled things people call ""words"" right, even the shittiest of music player will turn it off, or at least put the volume down till they go get their next batch of heroin or oxys or 40oz malts, or go to their grandmas house for cookies because they're still actually like 13.  BTW, what crazy-ass line do you take that has people lying down on their seats and people who abuse the drivers? Not to mention those people you talked about there at the end tend to be low-life scum and too deep in the shitter to  have to worry about losing anything. Are you low life scum? Then why are you acting like one and comparing yourself to them? I think those are the real questions right now you might wanna ask yourself.  PS: you know what a red herring is? Your on board respectful behavior has nothing to do with you not paying attention inside the vehicle and you not holding on to your belongings.."

mississauga,34vnju,karlos349,-1,Wed May 6 19:42:38 2015 UTC,that might have been a bit rude of me.. the truth should always be worded delicately i guess
mississauga,34vnju,tbnk,-2,Wed May 6 19:44:50 2015 UTC,"No. No. There is a lot wrong with what you said. Manners not withstanding. The truth doesn't need to be dressed up, nor in your case, dressed down.  The driver of the bus practised unsafe driving methods that endangered the passengers.  The driver should have approached the intersection while decelerating and coming to a full stop.  The fact that the driver had to mount a curb (which is an illegal movement) to prevent entering an illegal intersection is evident of this.  If OP was using his or her phone that would have naturally resulted in a broken screen then I would be hesitant to award damages.  However, mounting the curb is an unexpected movement that will catch people off guard, sometimes even if they prepare.  You might think it absurd that the OP doesn't monitor the bus driver and the driving conditions of the road for the full duration of the ride. I do not share this sentiment.  I don't expect the OP to have damages awarded, but I still support the decision to attempt. At the very least I know now to make a detailed incident report, the moment something happens, if I were involved in a similar situation.  You may have noticed that I didn't assume any instance of your heritage to make degrading remarks (read: racism). I disagreed with you and I stated, without being polite nor impolite, why.  My example isn't one of good form, it is the baseline of decency. Learning from it would be a good idea."

mississauga,34vnju,cyb3rat,2,Mon May 4 23:34:47 2015 UTC,"I like how everyone just assumes you're an idiot and it's all your fault.   Sucks the driver did what he did for whatever reason. I hope you grabbed names of other passengers.   That said, being on a bus is always precarious. There are a lot of warnings and rules you're supposed to follow that no one really does. It'll be tough for you to win anything.   Doesn't hurt to call them though."

But I don't suggest we ban cars.  This is no different.  I understand most women don't want to be oggled at the swimming pool. But the bad manners of some men should not be used as a reason to get rid of mixed gender swimming.  That should be the norm, and it should be available at all times during the day."
mississauga,349oo1,faelun,4,Fri May 1 16:21:01 2015 UTC,"In your analogy, we would be banning swimming. Anyways, my point here is not say who is right or wrong or if this is or isn't a good idea, the intention of my post is to say that the gender specific swim time is almost certainly a result of creepy dudes and not culture."

mississauga,349oo1,shaleesmo,6,Wed Apr 29 16:42:53 2015 UTC,"It is just the time slot that was changed, not the entire pool rules, right? I see no issue in this. If the majority of people in that time slot voted to have a female-only swimming time, then the pool has the right to aid their request."
mississauga,349oo1,AskmeAskme,7,Wed Apr 29 18:42:00 2015 UTC,"I am writing this from Mississauga Valley CC. My daughter is currently in a swimming class with mixed genders and I do not see any blinds nor can figure out where they would but the blinds mentioned. We are here every week and have never seen any of this. Another note, the MVCC has a communal locker room with individual change rooms, and since they are used by both the pool and the fitness centre, it wouldn't be possible to keep one gender out."
mississauga,349oo1,tsenaku,5,Wed Apr 29 20:55:44 2015 UTC,Most community centers that have public swimming also have mixed swimming times and women only swimming times. So all you have to do is inquire when there are mixed swimming times and take your daughter then. I don't necessarily think that having a south asian community facilitates that the swimming be women only but the demand for a time slot for women only just increased with the presence of that community. My sister and I have been swimming in mississauga since we were kids and there are several community centers that schedule their services for women only and for mixed its just a matter of doing the research.
mississauga,349oo1,aaffpp,4,Wed Apr 29 19:57:21 2015 UTC,"Don't blame the South Asians ... question the Mississauga Parks and Recreation Department directly. A few people requested it and City Staff jumped on the 'we got to do it because its culturally appropriate bandwagon'. Its not. What are we really saying here to our kids about the future if we implement policies and programs like this. More segregation, between cultures and sexes, possibly races. I can understand separate lessons, if you are targeting and encouraging a specific group to learn, or separate events if competition is involved, but separate public recreational times? Shortsighted."
mississauga,349oo1,JoanOfArctic,21,Thu Apr 30 06:55:20 2015 UTC,"There are reasons other than religion that women might prefer a female only swim time.  Swimsuits are revealing, and a lot of women, of any cultural background, have issues of body confidence.  Since swimming is a very effective and low impact form of exercise (so it is useful for young and old) it is important to provide opportunities for people to exercise in a way that ensures their comfort.  A lot of women who are trying to get fit avoid being seen doing so regardless of their background, just because they are afraid of receiving rude comments (or even looks) about their body.    It's unfortunate your daughter doesn't feel comfortable participating in a female only swim time.  Is this because the makeup of the women/girls is predominantly South Asian?  If so, this is perhaps an issue since it may be evidence your daughter is picking up prejudices from you.  The resentment, on your part, has no basis.  Failure to accommodate people with different, but congruent (ie it is not contrary to Canadian values) needs is what leads to racial tensions - not the reverse."
mississauga,349oo1,JoanOfArctic,6,Wed Apr 29 14:25:44 2015 UTC,"I would disagree with you that her frustrations are without foundation. In a diverse city such as Mississauga, there will be inevitable friction at times between cultural norms. This is normal and to be expected when you have dozens of cultures residing within a small area.   I think the issue here is potentially misreading the reasons for the segregation.  If in fact it was done to pacify cultural concerns, I would disagree with it.  We should be including cultural norms rather than adapting to it. There could be a segregated class included in addition to regular programming.   One of the things that makes Mississauga so great is that there are so many cultures within it. However, the minute we begin asking people to curtail their own accepted norms to make others comfortable (who sometimes aren't willing to curtail their own), I can see why people would become upset."
mississauga,349oo1,TrOuBLeDbOyXD,8,Wed Apr 29 17:58:45 2015 UTC,"I believe there continues to be co-ed swim times, it's just that the time this father used to take his daughter to is now women only, which the daughter (according to the father) has an issue with.  Also, as I said, female only swim times/female only gyms are not just for people from South Asia, who may or may not have religious or cultural reasons for not appearing disrobed in front of unrelated men.  Frankly, as a (white, atheist) woman, I'm down with a female only time if I can get it."

mississauga,349oo1,EpsilonSteve,4,Wed Apr 29 20:00:12 2015 UTC,"There can be mutual respect among cultures, but you can't force another culture, or religion, or race, to adopt something they dislike, if they're not hurting anyone.   As long as an immigrant is not harming anyone, you can NOT force him to do anything he doesn't want. Claiming your culture or religion is better than his is condescending.  Imagine if your daughter was ONLY allowed to swim in females only swimming pools. How would that feel? She might even drop swimming all together if it bothers her enough.  Honestly I just moved to Mississauga 6 months ago, and as a middle eastern man and Muslim, I am really happy with the treatment and respect I am getting.   This environment makes all immigrants happy. That will make them all proud to be Canadian, and they will want to contribute greatly here. However if they feel that they are being restricted, or oppressed, then you will shun them away, and the opposite will happen. They will stick to their cultures, and they will not identify as Canadians, and that will lead to more tension and laws, and cycle will be born. Just like how it is with the natives here. The most stern European countries like France has an entire generation of people who feel alienated, quite opposite to what it is to Canada here.  The OP gave an example below of Muslims in a Denmark town being unfair. That was one example three years ago, most, if not all Muslims will see it as unfair.  Just let people be.

mississauga,3468em,grant_us_eyes,3,Tue Apr 28 17:33:21 2015 UTC,"actually. me and my friends host our own friendly small smash tournaments every few weeks. i made this post because i was interested in getting more into the competitive scene.   im pretty positive my friends would all be down to go to a huge Mississauga tournament. there is about 6 of us that are semi pro level, which is cool.   so. if you could gather other people that you know that play smash, make some post on smash boards and other sites, we can make a really big and cool Mississauga tournament."

mississauga,343078,nthensome,7,Mon Apr 27 22:18:25 2015 UTC,When people drop money does the machine count it and tell you how much was dropped?
mississauga,343078,twinhed,3,Mon Apr 27 23:37:16 2015 UTC,Yes it does.   There's also a little clear window where we can see the change & ticket you put in.
mississauga,343078,twinhed,1 point,Tue Apr 28 00:08:50 2015 UTC,"I know about the window, but do you actually count the change and/or is there a mechanism that tells you how much was just deposited?"
mississauga,343078,kumquatqueen,4,Tue Apr 28 00:34:56 2015 UTC,Yes.   There is a digital counter that shows the amount of change deposited.   It's not always 100% accurate but it's pretty reliable.
mississauga,343078,rummuds,1 point,Tue Apr 28 01:36:12 2015 UTC,"I know you work only for MiWay, but do you know if the counter is commonplace across other bus systems?"
mississauga,343078,rummuds,3,Tue Apr 28 02:18:04 2015 UTC,The majority of the Zum buses and the orange and blue MiWay buses are identical. They are from the same manufacturer in Winnipeg.  So they have the same fare box as we do.  Not sure about Oakville and I'm almost positive that TTC still goes old school with the cash fare dropping into a little glass box.
mississauga,343078,the_honest_liar,2,Tue Apr 28 06:30:16 2015 UTC,To get here do they have to drive all the way from Winnipeg without going on the highway?
mississauga,343078,iMiiTH,2,Tue Apr 28 13:18:39 2015 UTC,"TBH I don't know.   But I would imagine that they're shipped in by train.   In 2014 we ordered 25 buses. I can't imagine that a caravan of 25 buses drove the 2000 kms from Manitoba.   Remember,  all city buses have a govenor that only allows the bus to do 105 kms"
mississauga,343078,karlos349,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:01:43 2015 UTC,TRAIN! ha didn't think of that for some reason.. yea the caravan of buses is what I too was picturing but seemed too absurd.

He'd pick one up, drive it all over North america to where ever it was going, and then they'd fly him back (or fly him out and he'd drive one back). He only ever did it with school buses, but maybe another company does something similar. Although train does sound easier."
mississauga,343078,JoanOfArctic,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:40:12 2015 UTC,The TTC is indeed old school. There's no cash counting everything's just dropped into a clear box which is emptied with a mechanical lever (at least on the street cars).

Have you ever seen a passenger attempt to bring something really preposterous on board/ what's the most ridiculous thing you've seen people bring in? (a goat, some fandangled ""art"" piece).

Generally though, there's about 15-30 ppl on here from what i've noticed, but it might be worth a shot! Oh, maybe we can get a few mississauga related AMAs going, maybe in a series to generate more traffic on the sub? /u/Albizzy might find the idea interesting  P.S.: Also holy nutcrackers, i forgot my phone on the bus and a driver turned it in the next day at the lost and found where i was able to pick it up, about a couple months back. Thanks  if you've ever found stuff and took it in to the L&F! if not yet, thanks on that drivers behalf."

mississauga,345vyp,atioxx,2,Tue Apr 28 15:31:31 2015 UTC,I would join you if this were in Toronto (I reside there now). I recently added skipping rope into my workout. Problem is I can only do it with both feet jumping. I'm trying to learn to do other types of footwork by watching YouTube videos but I still don't get it. Got any tips?
mississauga,345vyp,goodRock,2,Tue Apr 28 18:11:40 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I would say focus on both legs now, till you are able to jump very little while passing the rope.   From time to time, slow down and jump a little bit high and catch up a breath.  Your next set of footwork should also involve both legs, like side to side jumps and going forward and backward, etc.  Before you try jumping on one leg, try jogging in your place. You will feel yourself heavy if you are not used to jogging . To intensify it, allow your knee to reach as high as possible.  To start some good footwork, focus on one leg at a time, meaning jumping 3-5 times on one and then alternate to both legs to rest. Do that for each leg as many sets as you can. You start to feel the heat when you focus on both legs doing this move.  You know you got used to it when you master jumping too little one leg at a time and alternating at each single jump. Just like jogging but with very little raise.  From there you can do pretty much anything, but watch your face when you attempt crossovers and double jumps. Don't worry, no permanent damage ;)"

mississauga,343pb9,karlos349,3,Tue Apr 28 01:33:29 2015 UTC,"For a byelection it's not shabby.   What I find interesting though is how few votes it took to win. The election site has slightly different numbers, so I guess Mississauga News used numbers from before the last poll closed. 21% of people voted, or 8,995 ballots. So that means there are 42,834 eligible voters. 1,565 voted for Kovac. So he won with 3.7% of people actually voting for him...."
mississauga,343pb9,tsenaku,5,Tue Apr 28 21:21:12 2015 UTC,"Well if this election taught us anything... the more signs you put up, the more votes you get. I really liked a few of the other candidates platforms (Joe Horneck, Mike Douglas and Stephen King in particular). Unfortunately I really couldn't find much about John Kovac; I guess people just voted for the name they recognized (Probably from all the signs).  Anyone have any insight into his platform or priorities? His website is really vague. Not really sure what to expect from him."

mississauga,3419uf,THROWmahawk,2,Mon Apr 27 18:57:57 2015 UTC,You're looking at around 100 plus tax. It's $41 for 1 day care and $20 for boarding.
mississauga,3419uf,Aceken,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:57:23 2015 UTC,"So, 41$ + 20$ per day&night? I've never done boarding so is that a decent price or is there a cheaper place to go to?"

mississauga,3419uf,rkaweza,1 point,Wed Apr 29 20:25:41 2015 UTC,"Boarding your dog is definitely expensive. Most facilities do offer discounts once you buy a package and you'll save a couple bucks.   There are plenty of businesses that will offer the same thing and others who will claim that they have something special. In the end it's word of mouth and what you decide to go with.  And yes, I do recommend it due to the fact that it's new in eastern canada and it's a dedicated daycare/boarding."

There are several that rarely apply so we don't usually go through them, except maybe quickly.  Yesterday, a lady came in and it was only after talking to her a bit that in my head I went, oh crap, I better head back to the interview questions.  So I asked all of the ones I knew didn't apply, including the one I suspected did.  She was a Status Indian and as such was entitled to exemptions on her employment income.

Even the reason on paper is horrific: it was done to remove all traces of their language, their culture.  The reality was much worse, they were physically and sexually abused and physically neglected (in terms of food, shelter and medical care) to the point that thousands of children (CHILDREN) died.  This was all done via government funded institutions that were run by churches (catholic and anglican, mostly).  I'm not sure if maybe we've been desensitized to the phrases physical and sexual abuse, either.  I'm talking about priests anally raping 5 year olds.  So talk to me about kids suffering.  Go on.  I dare you."

mississauga,33u07m,Jeff146,2,Sat Apr 25 16:51:02 2015 UTC,Dicking around with trying to find one used tire to match the set is going to be a waste of time.... especially in the context of a low volume performance tire.  Your move should be to buy 2 new tires and shelf the other good one in the event you get a flat in the future.

mississauga,33s3be,Mitoshi,19,Sat Apr 25 02:11:35 2015 UTC,Isn't downtown just a mall?  You wouldn't drive there unless you are going to Square One no?  Anyway my tips would be to avoid Hurontario to get to the mall.  The section between Eglinton and Burnhamthrope is usually busy during mall hours.  Try to avoid Mavis too because of construction.  Burnhamthrope itself seems alright most of the time.  However my recommendation would be to use Rathburn and Conferation to get in/out if you can.
mississauga,33s3be,number8888,7,Sat Apr 25 03:35:22 2015 UTC,"I live and work downtown and I hate it lol. I wish I could avoid Hurontario St most days of my life however it's the only direct route to most places I need to go. My office is right on Robert Speck and my apartment is in the cluster on Burnhamthorpe. There is no escaping it. Traffic in this city is getting worse day by day. I walk to work most days, as does my husband. He takes the Go Bus to North York every day to avoid the hectic drive on the 401. I wish more people would walk/take transit as opposed to driving 2 km but that's just the way things are now.   Shortcuts: take Elm Dr from Hurontario to get to square one without getting stuck at hwy 10/Burnhamthorpe. You'll get out at Kariya/Burnhamthorpe.  Take Robert Speck pkwy from Burnhamthorpe to reach the east side, you can get out onto hwy 10/Robert Speck and avoid the three stop lights in between Burnhamthorpe and the highway (if you make right turns). Sherwoodtown blvd is mostly empty and a great way to reach 403 E"
mississauga,33s3be,Amelia87,3,Sat Apr 25 03:43:03 2015 UTC,do you drive from home to work?  It's like a 10 minute walk...
mississauga,33s3be,JoanOfArctic,6,Sat Apr 25 03:46:40 2015 UTC,I said I walk to work.  it's a 12 minute walk lol. Especially when it's snowing. Easier to walk than drive. I only drive on days I have appointments or need to attend a meeting outside the office in the middle of the day. Those days I park at square one. I'm not paying $65 to park 1 km away from my house.

mississauga,33s3be,JoanOfArctic,5,Sat Apr 25 03:51:14 2015 UTC,"Live there. It's bad but it's nowhere near as bad as everyone makes it seem.   You can get down 10( Hurontario )to egligton from burnhamthorpe in like 5 - 10 min and after that it's just any other busy street.   Going to the mall? Come from Kariya Gate, turn right on City Centre drive and go into the parking from the back.   If you are going to the highway, just go down 10.   I mean it's bad, but it's not like driving down Young or Queen in Toronto. Just be a little patient. 5-10 mins and you're through it. Especially since they finished the construction."
mississauga,33s3be,swrdfish,13,Sat Apr 25 05:27:44 2015 UTC,"That's cute that Mississauga thinks it has a ""downtown"". It's a shopping mall and some condos. It's literally like 4 blocks. Even in the worst traffic imaginable, you can clear all of ""downtown"" in 15 minutes."

mississauga,33qw7q,rummuds,1 point,Sat Apr 25 02:15:14 2015 UTC,"I was going to suggest this. Except I normally enter at the Burnhamthorpe bridge and I didn't know it extended past Erindale park. But yea great views, much of it is paved, and all of it is wide (except the wooden bridges when you get in the park but these are well maintained). If you start at the park and head towards Burnhamthorpe you can also exit the path by going up the hill. If you go north on Burnhamthorpe the paved bike path next to the sidewalk (not on the road), I think leads all the way to square one, heading south it leads all the way to S. Common Mall. Even if you go North take some time on that bridge.. there are two little look out spots built in that have the best views (the one closer to the trail entrance is better). The bridge path on that side was widened especially for bikers as one fell over the edge years back. (If I remember correctly, their handle bar got caught in the guard bars and they flipped over... EDIT: found it)"

mississauga,33qw7q,BambooRollin,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:50:02 2015 UTC,"I didn't make it sound like a bad thing, but you really do have to go fast when on major roads. On side roads, obviously not, but on major roads, you most likely do, without going over the speed limit of course. I never said road biking was terrible, all I said was that it is too plain as there is no exploring in it or anything like that.

mississauga,33jm0l,JoanOfArctic,5,Thu Apr 23 13:21:18 2015 UTC,Can anyone explain to me why we need an North-South LRT along Hurontario? How many Mississauga residents actually need to travel to Brampton for work? This seems like a massive waste of resources.
mississauga,33jm0l,TheDarkLight,9,Thu Apr 23 03:39:23 2015 UTC,"How many Mississauga residents actually need to travel to Brampton for work? This seems like a massive waste of resources.   It's not meant to have get new people to take transit to Brampton. It's meant to have a local transit spine along a route that already has huge ridership that connects to the transitway and 3 GO Lines (which will eventually be 15 minute frequency RER). In the morning/evening, taking the LRT to a GO Line downtown would be much quicker than taking, for example, a subway from square one downtown. (Keep in mind a subway trip from square one to downtown would take at least an hour and a half- you are doubling the distance along the Bloor line)  Hurontario is already one of the busiest bus routes in the area- it's not like they assume people would magically appear. It's also one of the densest corridors outside of Toronto- a lot of people live walking distance from a station.   Current ridership has shown we need a higher capacity NS route. EW routes will soon be well served by GO (the next focus should be getting RER on the Milton line ASAP)."
mississauga,33jm0l,karlos349,15,Thu Apr 23 11:32:24 2015 UTC,"I've been following this for a while and have, up until recently, been strongly opposed to the project. Looking at the Hurontario LRT in the context of regional transit though starts to make the project more logical. The LRT will connect 3 GO lines, the Transitway, one of the busiest GO bus terminals and the future 407 transitway. Once RER is implemented and trains run every 15 minutes on all 3 GO lines, this will be a major connecting point between a lot of pieces in the greater transit network.  I totally agree most Mississauga residents aren't moving north-south. But once RER is up and running there will be a huge increase in usage of the Milton and Kitchener GO lines, the LRT will tie them together. Imagine going from Milton/Oakville/Burlington to Brampton/Kitchener/Georgetown. Being able to transfer between GO lines without going downtown will open up a whole bunch of new routes we've never considered (I realize those locations are odd examples). This concept of taking mass transit between cities that aren't on the lakeshore line and that don't include Union Station is totally new. The Hurontario LRT is just another way to tie everything together. Once I look at it that way, it makes a lot more sense to me. Plus there are still a decent amount of normal commuters who would use this every day, so I'm all for it now.  The big thing we have to figure out now is coordinated fares. Taking a trip from Oakville to Kitchener by way of the LRT would be prohibitively expensive with the current fare structure."
mississauga,33jm0l,karlos349,4,Thu Apr 23 06:46:07 2015 UTC,This comment from an old thread comes to mind
mississauga,33jm0l,JoanOfArctic,2,Thu Apr 23 12:48:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah that was my main reason too for being sceptical of the LRT. The way Mississauga is laid out in city center Hurontario takes a huge bulk of the NS traffic. But look at how popular the Lakeshore line is all throughout the day, the last train at 12:43 is usually pretty packed. Imagine that over the other two lines too. If nothing else it will take away the trips from people driving down Hurontario to get to PC. So I guess we won't know until both the LRT and RER are in place.  As a side note, with RER there's no reason they couldn't add more stations for local trains. Mavis, Cawthra on the Milton line. Loren Park and Cawthra on the Lakeshore line to name a few.  The construction phase is going to be awful though... not looking forward to that at all."
mississauga,33jm0l,karlos349,2,Thu Apr 23 19:34:58 2015 UTC,"The more stations you add, the slower it goes, so you have to be careful there."
mississauga,33jm0l,TheDarkLight,2,Thu Apr 23 20:34:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah true, I'm imagining a mix of express/local service for people traveling both through the city and within it. Just saying there are a lot of ways they can play this. Like right now you'd never consider taking the GO train from Streetsville to Square One... but cooksville to LRT might be convenient."
mississauga,33jm0l,karlos349,1 point,Thu Apr 23 22:04:39 2015 UTC,"The LRT will connect 3 GO lines, the Transitway, one of the busiest GO bus terminals and the future 407 transitway. Once RER is implemented and trains run every 15 minutes on all 3 GO lines, this will be a major connecting point between a lot of pieces in the greater transit network.   We don't need more connecting points. We need actual transit pathways. Connecting points create the need for more transfers, more time consumed, and more bottlenecks.   But once RER is up and running there will be a huge increase in usage of the Milton and Kitchener GO lines, the LRT will tie them together. Imagine going from Milton/Oakville/Burlington to Brampton/Kitchener/Georgetown   Why would usage of either of those lines be affected by the LRT? LRT goes along Hurontario, the Milton Line joins up with the Lakeshore line by Sq 1. I think you're overestimating the number of people that need to make ""under-served"" trips like Milton->Brampton. No doubt, there may be a number of commuters that need the corridor but is it really more than the incredible number that spend ~1.5 hrs transiting to Toronto every day? We have a variety of transit options that can at least meet the needs of the people making these less used trips. The issue isn't that we can't get from one city to another. It's that we have some of the longest daily commute times on the continent. That's unacceptable for a Metropolis which will only be adding more commuters working in Toronto as the city and GTA continues to grow.   Plus there are still a decent amount of normal commuters who would use this every day, so I'm all for it now.   What's a normal commuter? A HS student? Because they should just take the 19 (I think that's the transit bus if I'm not mistaken). Increase the frequency of the 19 even more if need be. Hurontario is already a congested mess because of the population density along the road. Not because people need to use it as an artery. Taking away lanes or adding confusion in the form of a light rail in the middle of the road seems to me like you're asking for more traffic on the road. Drivers going N/S on Hurontario are not going to stop taking cars to take the train because their destinations don't lie on Hurontario. Otherwise they would have taken the 19 or a GO Bus.  Moreover, this project contradicts Toronto's future public transit plans. They need to realize Mississauga is still very much dependent on Toronto. We can think about regional transit options after the issues are solved with our current transit needs which do not include going from Milton to Brampton.  Overall I think Mississauga would have been better served putting resources into developing E/W transit options because, despite all the options that exist, it is simply not up to par. When 3 hours of your day are taken up just commuting, there's something wrong with the system."
mississauga,33jm0l,JoanOfArctic,3,Thu Apr 23 16:09:39 2015 UTC,"You make some good points, but I think the reality is the projects that are currently underway will largely fill the W/E need that we have now. Service on all 3 GO lines is being improved (Milton and Kitchener drastically, Lakeshore less so). the Transitway will help get people to the eventual extension to the Eglinton LRT (Which is already planned to hit the Renforth Transitway station). Plus the Transit way was built to be eventually converted to an LRT (Once ridership numbers justify the conversion). I don't honestly think we should rush into more redundant W/E mass transit lines, but rather get people to these lines. Also, the Milton and Lakeshore lines are about a 20 minute bus ride apart from each other at Square One, so not clear on what you mean by they join up.  I agree the Milton > Brampton example is obscure. I just mean it will open up transit options that have up until now been a drive only type trip. The more convenient you make getting around the region, the more cars we can hope to get off the roads. Which is really the end goal, you can't just build highways to get yourself out of gridlock.  Hurontario is a mess, there's no doubt about it. But it's already more or less maxed out in terms of lanes. So adding more busses won't alleviate congestion, it will add to it. On that same note, by ""Normal commuters"" I meant people traveling locally, not accessing regional transit (Like people traveling between city center and Brampton). With the number of development happening all up and down Hurontario, things will only get worse unless people have another option. I feel like having an LRT will actually attract people who don't want to drive, to these new condos.  What would you like to see in terms of W/E transit to improve travel times? I'd love to discuss some alternates.  It's a complex debate, so I'm interested to explore this more... I really don't know what the future holds, but I feel good about this direction."

mississauga,33g0tv,hekomi,1 point,Wed Apr 22 12:22:40 2015 UTC,Are you talking about Port Credit Pets? They closed up shop and are online only now. They're always horribly over priced.

mississauga,33cedv,toronto34,5,Tue Apr 21 11:40:23 2015 UTC,Construction starts in 2018?! I'm worried now - there's a municipal election in 2018. I hope this isn't a promise that ends up getting canned in the next election.
mississauga,33cedv,Bopper123,1 point,Tue Apr 21 13:28:39 2015 UTC,I don't think they will cancel it at that point. They would have spent a lot of time and money on the planning and design. Plus with the full cost being picked up by the province there would be no sane reason for a municipal politician turn their back on something like $1.7 Billion in free infrastructure funding.
mississauga,33cedv,cykloid,3,Tue Apr 21 16:32:45 2015 UTC,"It's happened before (the power plant). I'm honestly worried that this will become a point in the next election - e.g. vote for us again because we can deliver the LRT, a vote for the other guy is a waste of money because they might scrap it."
mississauga,33cedv,ockupid2,6,Tue Apr 21 16:37:58 2015 UTC,Nah there just gunna build it then sell it to some Spanish conglomerate In 10 years for 1/3 of the price
mississauga,33cedv,pelito,4,Tue Apr 21 21:39:16 2015 UTC,I don't think they will cancel it at that point. They would have spent a lot of time and money on the planning and design. Plus with the full cost being picked up by the province there would be no sane reason for a municipal politician turn their back on something like $1.7 Billion in free infrastructure funding.   That is exactly what happened to most of the Provincially funded LRTs Toronto was supposed to get before Rob Ford. Never be surprised at how badly municipal politics can fuck up a good deal.

I have a high performance package with TekSavvy and I have to say I've never been short of happy with them.

I started with the 30mbps cable package with you guys. 2 months ago I upgraded to the 50mbps down package and I've been testing speeds constantly and NEVER get above 30 mbps..so basically im paying 15 bucks more a month for the same speed.

mississauga,33a77q,c74,2,Tue Apr 21 00:14:54 2015 UTC,Do you recommend cable or DSL? Is there a difference?
mississauga,33a77q,TSI-ShawnS,6,Tue Apr 21 00:17:35 2015 UTC,"DSL: You need to have a landline or pay for a dry loop, speed/connection quality depends on your distance to the central office. During peak hours your DSL line would perform better than a cable line since it is dedicated.  Cable: A shared line so congestion during peak hours. Connection does not degrade over long distances, usually faster than DSL. Costs a bit more.  So if you are not a heavy user go with DSL.  Edit: DSL also depends on the phone line wiring in your house so bad copper = bad connection.  And although I am not with Teksavvy, I have heard nothing but great things about them."

Then pray that they won't find it in the next few weeks (I believe it was a month give or take?). Then insurance will reimburse you the book value of the car (if it's new).

mississauga,32e8bz,Oswinox,7,Mon Apr 13 01:48:44 2015 UTC,"As much as there are asshole cyclists there are asshole drivers.   You lose points on your rant when you don't know the rules yourself.   Yes, cyclists have to stop at lights, stops signs and other road signs.   Cyclists also have the right to the lane they're in. On a bike, I can take up the entire right lane and it's your job as a motorists to pass safely.   Maybe if people on both sides of the discussion would drop the needless stereotyping and focus on the facts and maybe educate themselves a little. We'd actually get somewhere."
mississauga,32e8bz,swrdfish,4,Mon Apr 13 03:56:19 2015 UTC,"As for your collision thing, I'm not 100% on this but it probably has a lot to do with the fact we have insurance as a driver but not as a cyclist.   I nightly doubt you have to buy me a new bike if I decide to make a left turn in front of you.   As for the wobble thing and things for you as a driver to keep in mind is that cyclists are often clipped into their pedals. Their feet aren't freed easily from the pedals. So when stopping or getting into a collision, they can't just put our feet down all the time."
mississauga,32e8bz,swrdfish,3,Mon Apr 13 03:59:05 2015 UTC,The biggest deterrent here isn't insurance. It is life preservation.  You don't typically have to replace the bike because the cyclist is likely dead in the scenario.
mississauga,32e8bz,northernpenguin,2,Mon Apr 13 14:12:38 2015 UTC,I'm willing to bet more cyclists get damaged bikes then die in collisions...
mississauga,32e8bz,swrdfish,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:00:59 2015 UTC,"I understand that I may have missed a few things because to be honest I was in a pissed off mood because I just had to deal with three cyclists not wearing reflective gear and I almost killed them because they did not stop at the stop sign that I know was there. Further, they also made me and the five cars behind me slam on our breaks because they wanted to make a left onto the next street. Time and again I see this stuff happening. I'm sure there are cyclists that are great at following the rules of the road, but I'm basically just singling out the Mattamy people because they do not give a single fuck and that pisses me off (and I'm also talking on and off their bikes because I've had to deal with them being snooty about getting coffee, and on a few occasions some really homophobic comments, but that is irrelevant in this case). Either way, I don't think they particularly know the rules of the road.   I am aware this is a complex issue, but I'm also aware that I do not want to hit cyclists whether or not they are being stupid and disregarding the rules of the road. I'm doing my best to follow the rules and give them space, but there is only so much space on Lakeshore Road in Port Credit and the side streets. Especially when it is insanely busy when it gets nice out.   And yes, they can sue whether or not it is their fault and will probably win the case."
mississauga,32e8bz,JoanOfArctic,11,Mon Apr 13 15:44:17 2015 UTC,"While cyclists should of course obey the rules of the road (stopping at red lights/stop signs, using hand signals, etc.) and some of them don't, you are incorrect in stating that they MUST line up single file on the far right of a lane.  Cyclists have the right to ""take the lane"" and motorists must pass them properly and safely in all cases, which includes slowing down until it is safe to pass.  I more frequently see motorists pass cyclists unsafely (passing too close) rather than mediate their speed for 30 seconds.  In fact, riding two abreast seems to be a strategy to not get effectively slammed into the gutter by suburbanites in chevy suburbans who think cyclists should be on the sidewalk.  Furthermore, in order to turn left legally, a cyclist is legally obligated to get into the left lane.  This is only practical if taking to the lane."
mississauga,32e8bz,northernpenguin,4,Mon Apr 13 02:14:31 2015 UTC,"Me, I love the cyclists in Caledon and Halton Hills, on a two lane road full of hills and curves that ride two abreast at 15km/h in an 80 km/h zone. Passing these cyclists is ridiculously unsafe due to the hills and curves and I have been stuck behind them at 15km/h for 6 kilometres at times. I never pass a cyclist in the same lane if I can avoid it. A similar courtesy would be to maybe pull off to the side if you have nine cars in a line behind you, or perhaps use the Caledon Trailway instead. Not all of us have a pleasant afternoon to take three hours to get across town."
mississauga,32e8bz,JoanOfArctic,1 point,Mon Apr 13 14:10:35 2015 UTC,"as far as I recall, those lanes still necessitate a passing car to move over the median.  If you can't move over the full way, you can't move over part way.  You'd be stuck behind them either way, unless you passed too close.  Also, those cyclists may be going 15km/h on the uphill, but a cyclist on a roadbike is likely doing at least 35-40km/h on the downhills, since that is actually a reasonable speed for a reasonably fit road biker to achieve going on the flat."
mississauga,32e8bz,northernpenguin,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:07:37 2015 UTC,"Which sort of reinforces the idea that finding a two lane road without shoulders that heads straight up the Niagara Escarpment with a posted 80km/h zone is perhaps not the optimal place for a cyclist. 40km/h is still half the speed that people are expecting to travel at.   I have met some nice cyclists, and I have also met the kind that stay smack in the centre of the lane at the top of the escarpment and pedal along at 5km/h winded from the climb. It really isn't too much to just pull the bike off the road and stop for a moment. Same as I do in my car when someone wants to go faster than I do on a road with a wide enough shoulder.   I will never forget the poor soul I saw climbing out of the Credit River valley at 7:30 AM on Heritage Road with at least 30 cars right behind them. That fellow made quite a few people 30 minutes late for work and the soccer mom in the minivan damn near killed him trying to pass at one point. If the fellow had simply stopped the bike for a moment - reminder that he made the line up of cars starting at Bovaird, a good 2km back - he would have been safer for it. Then again, he could have taken the bike trail that parallels McLaughlin too."
mississauga,32e8bz,JoanOfArctic,2,Mon Apr 13 19:21:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not familiar with the bike trail.  Since it is not a 400 series hiway on which cyclists are barred from riding, he had every right to be there, whether you like it or not. It may have annoyed you, just as the woman calling for four seperate price checks then paying in small change at the grocery store ahead of me annoys me - but she has every right to do what she is doing and my impatience is both temporary and nobody else's problem but my own.  TL;DR: Sometimes other people do things that is not to your convenience and that is ok as long as they are abiding all applicable laws."
mississauga,32e8bz,northernpenguin,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:50:11 2015 UTC,"So, what you are saying is if I ask for some courtesy, the response is ""fuck you"", and yet we wonder why drivers pass cyclists in the same lane or fail to extend a courtesy to them like passing in a different lane.   You are 100% correct to the letter of the law a bicycle can ride smack down the centre of Heritage Road from Terra Cotta to Mississauga. The cyclist is still an asshole that does that."
mississauga,32e8bz,JoanOfArctic,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:56:27 2015 UTC,"One of these situations is a courtesy, to which the cyclist has no obligations.  The other is a safety hazard, with regards to which the law is clear."
mississauga,32e8bz,northernpenguin,1 point,Mon Apr 13 20:48:53 2015 UTC,"If I get in my car, and travel 15 km/h in an 80 km/h zone, would it be a safety concern? Make sure there are curves and hills on the road.  What if I travel 35 km/h on the 401?   Yet a cyclist who ignores the traffic around them because they have the letter of the law is not a safety concern.   Everyone in my opinion would be a LOT safer if we were simply a bit courteous rather than driving or biking as if we have a lawyer joining us on the ride.   What, exactly, is wrong with suggesting that the cyclist with 30 cars lined up behind them should CONSIDER pulling over and letting them go by, and asking the drivers to maybe consider waiting for a break in oncoming traffic to give the cyclist a wide pass in the opposite lane.   I fail to see how ""fuck you it's my right"" makes things better car or bike.   Be nice to each other. Be predictable. Take one extra second to consider the other person. And for God's sakes put down the Highway Traffic Act and watch the road in front."
mississauga,32e8bz,JoanOfArctic,2,Mon Apr 13 21:11:28 2015 UTC,"You may not like it.  I may not like it (I'm not a cyclist, at least not presently) - but that's the law.  Pass safely or don't pass at all.  Cyclists can choose to pull over and let motorists pass, but just like a UHaul towing a car on the Trans-Canada in summer - they have no obligation to do so."

mississauga,32e8bz,JoanOfArctic,2,Mon Apr 13 16:59:26 2015 UTC,"If there is a bike lane, and it is free of debris and parked vehicles, cyclists should be in it (unless turning left).  However, if they feel cars are still passing them too closely, regardless of the existence of a bike lane, they have the legal right to be in the lane, as a vehicle.  This does not absolve them of their responsibilities to observe the rules of the road."
mississauga,32e8bz,HandsomeHarry,3,Mon Apr 13 17:17:33 2015 UTC,"Borrow a road bike, try cycling in Mississauga, and you will quickly understand why cyclists ""take the lane"".  Your rant is akin to having to wait for pedestrians crossing the street before you can turn right in your motorized vehicle.  Stop being impatient.  I've been cycling for two years in peel, and have nearly been hot twice by a madwoman in a minivan that didn't give me space in the lane.  Drivers like OP make it unsafe."
mississauga,32e8bz,northernpenguin,2,Mon Apr 13 16:26:43 2015 UTC,"Just a technicality, while a bicycle is entitled to ""Take the lane"" that does not automatically mean the cyclist can just ride down the lane three inches to the right of the yellow line for kilometers without end. However, side-by-side cycling IS permitted:   147(1) - Slow moving vehicles  This section does not prohibit side by side cycling. Vehicles must be driven in the right hand lane or as close as >practicable to the edge of the roadway when travelling at less than the speed of the traffic at the time. Presumably ""as >close to the edge as practicable"" takes care of roads that are not laned, e.g. dirt roads and many residential streets.   Good news about cycling in Mississauga: most of the major streets have four lanes so traffic can flow around the cyclist.  Bad news about cycling in Mississauga: bad attitudes behind the wheel and also on the bikes themselves leading to conflict. Pot holes in the curb lane. Assholes in SUVs. Assholes that think it's a good idea to merge into traffic from a forested park trail at 20kph without so much as feathering the brake lever.   As for cyclists who blow through stop signs/red lights or wrong way or up on sidewalks then back onto roads unpredictably..... you're going to get killed.   Fun thing about cities, is that the driver has enough things to keep an eye on with other cars, and pedestrians crossing in odd places to flashing store signs to hundreds of road signs and such. The purpose of those laws you are ignoring is to keep you predictable, so the driver has a chance to actually see the vehicle zipping into traffic at 20km/h before contacting it with the car.   While I may complain about bikes from a car, I've also been the cyclist to crash over someone's hood on Dundas Street when they made a left turn in front of me (I was in the right hand lane doing a good 20 kph too)."
mississauga,32e8bz,proudofya,1 point,Mon Apr 13 21:47:13 2015 UTC,"Mississauga is all 2 or 3 lanes in one direction, so if a cyclist takes the lane we can still path. One single lane roads, especially those that don't have breaks in the solid yellow line, you're stuck behind a cyclist on a 70km-80km road.   What if you were driving down such a road and an old lady was driving her car 20km/h? Would you still be singin the same tune? Of course she's capable of speeding up, just like the cyclist is capable of pulling off the the side since they're not in a hurry to get nowhere fast to begin with."
mississauga,32e8bz,HandsomeHarry,1 point,Sat Apr 18 12:01:27 2015 UTC,Are you asking if a driver breaking the law (driving too slow) is the same as a cyclist or cyclists that are following the rules? Even two-lane roads have passing areas.
mississauga,32e8bz,HandsomeHarry,1 point,Sat Apr 18 18:10:29 2015 UTC,"I have cycled in mississauga for many years. I should not have to state what kind of transportation I've taken in order for my rant to be any less valid. This is my own personal experience with cyclist, which has not been very good. I get that there are impatient people and that there are at times no reason for being impatient and unsafe about other motorist. But why do I have to slow down and have to curb my own schedule around cyclists? I have places to be and things to do and driving behind bikes because there is no where else for me to go on a busy street for 3 Km is not something I particularly want to do. If I have to be courteous to bikes, why can't they be courteous to cars? why does 'share the road' not apply to bikes? That's not fair.   I think you are also missing the point of my rant which was the majority of people on bikes that I have met do not follow the rules of the road."
mississauga,32e8bz,HandsomeHarry,2,Mon Apr 13 16:47:10 2015 UTC,"As a motor vehicle operator, by law you are to yield to non-motorized vehicles.   Don't like it? Tough shit. Have places to be? So does everyone else, and if you don't like being blocked in by a cyclist for 3km, you are in Mississauga... take a detour. there's an intersection every 500M. It's your mentality behind the wheel that makes it dangerous for cyclists in Peel.   You have a motorized vehicle, you have the least amount of right-of-way on the road."
mississauga,32e8bz,HandsomeHarry,-1,Mon Apr 13 18:18:08 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying but you don't understand what my whole rant was about. My own personal experience with cyclists is bad. They do not use the rules of the road even though they have to. I don't mind sharing the road if it means the cyclists also obey the rules. You do not get to be absolved of your responsibilities just because you are riding on two wheels and do not have a motor. You are on the road, you are on a vehicle.   You're mentality is also flawed and makes it unsafe if you take your life into your own hands and think drivers are going to look out for you 100%. We try but we also have to worry about other drivers being assholes, and pedestrians. You are not special, you are just another thing we have to look out for and sometimes people miss it. We go 50-60km an hour and you winging out onto busy streets makes it a little hard for cars to stop and sometimes you get hit, we get hurt, or someone else does. Shit happens and if you are responsible for an accident you should be held accountable.   Whatever, guess it just doesn't matter. You clearly don't understand what I am trying to say and you don't care to see it from someone else's point of view."

mississauga,32c6bl,SHUT_DOWN_EVERYTHING,3,Sun Apr 12 15:50:55 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, they never thought it over until recently."
mississauga,32c6bl,UtilityPole,3,Sun Apr 12 16:07:40 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree that a major overhaul is needed to the City's public transit infrastructure.  But it raises a major question- who's going to foot the bill, for it?  Because the City of Mississauga's property owners already pay a high amount of property taxes, especially when compared to our neighbours in Toronto."
mississauga,32c6bl,regginface,3,Sun Apr 12 16:49:16 2015 UTC,It's mind-blowing to think that someone with an iotia of city-planning acumen would suggest a subway in Mississauga right now.
mississauga,32c6bl,JoanOfArctic,6,Sun Apr 12 21:38:44 2015 UTC,"Let me get this straight, the city can't afford an LRT, but this candidate wants to build a subway, which is way more expensive than an LRT? Sounds like empty promises just trying to get votes."
mississauga,32c6bl,rinobo,1 point,Sun Apr 12 17:50:01 2015 UTC,"while that was my first thought, he does say:   As the City of Mississauga awaits a funding announcement on LRT, I believe that the required $1.6 billion investment for LRT would be better spent on a subway. At a cost of approximately $300 million per kilometre to build a subway, $1.6 billion would essentially pay for a subway from Kipling to Hurontario Street, (almost half of the total 12.2 kilometre line).  This assumes expensive tunnel boring is required; however, given the wide rights of way on both Dundas Street and Hurontario Street, it may be possible to use an open dig method, which could substantially reduce costs.   Now, I have no idea if the $300M/km figure is accurate, but if that is the case... I have to say a subway would make quite a bit more sense than an LRT up Hurontario.  And, as far as I can tell, it sure makes a whole heck of a lot more sense than the current transitway along the 403, which I can't for the life of me figure out how a person without a car would get to.  (And if you have a car, why the hell would you bother with it just to get to Kipling or wherever it goes?  I'd just park at Kipling like I currently do)"
mississauga,32c6bl,JoanOfArctic,5,Sun Apr 12 23:22:07 2015 UTC,"$300m/km is standard for Toronto subway pricing, although the scarborough extension is expected to come in close to $400m/km. LRTs cost about a third of that.  The reason a Hurontario LRT makes more sense than a subway to Kipling is because Hurontario currently has the highest number of riders of any route in Mississauga, so much so without the LRT busses will no longer be able to cope with the demand required on Hurontario by 2030 (?).   For Kipling, the transitway will do a good enough job of handling the demand to the Bloor subway line as well as the Eglinton crosstown when it opens. For anyone going downtown, it'll be much faster to take the LRT to Cooksville and take a GO train to Union (which will be running frequently once the electrification happens in 10-15 years) as opposed to taking the subway all the way from Sq1 > YongeBloor > Union.  It should also be noted that the transitway isn't just meant for MiWay, but will be used just as much by GO Transit once it has been fully built out (Erin Mills/Winston Churchill stops under construction). It will provide GO with a convenient and fast route across the city with unimpeded access.  Edit: I should say that I am not opposed to a subway to Sq1 per say. However at the current time we have way more pressing concerns that need to be addressed before a sq1 subway should be considered (eg. Hurontario LRT, electrification of all GO lines within Mississauga + frequent service, incorporating Toronto SmarTrack connections with MiWay, introduction of more MiExpress routes), by which point the cost vs benefit required of a subway just might make sense."
mississauga,32c6bl,JoanOfArctic,3,Sun Apr 12 23:35:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess I don't really see Hurontario too often because I live way west of there and basically avoid that road as much as possible.  I never take MiWay either (the odd time I take it to the GO station if we're going into Toronto and I plan on drinking - otherwise I drive to Kipling since it's cheaper) so my opinion is basically worthless.  I'm not opposed to public transportation, of course.  We're moving to Toronto soon mainly to be on the TTC.  I just don't have much use for slow busses that don't go where I'm going.  I know that doesn't apply to the Transitway, but since I can't figure out how to GET to the Transitway without driving...."

It was supposed to connect to the subway extension but Toronto killed that plan so Mississauga is still building the transitway just it won't end up hooking up with a subway now. For now at least. They built it anyways because who knows, in 30 years Toronto might build that extension and then the transitway will already be there."
mississauga,32c6bl,Mitoshi,1 point,Mon Apr 13 00:31:43 2015 UTC,"Mississauga is still building the transitway just it won't end up hooking up with a subway now.   The 109 goes to the subway and it's extremely likely more routes in the future will. Right now it goes along Eglinton to the 427, but when the transitway is complete it will be end very close to the bus only ramp to the 427. From there it's pretty quick to the subway, although a stop right at Dundas/427 would be ideal- that's the big bottleneck. 427 collectors in that section isn't usually too busy, even in rush hour.   Considering the subway travels around 30 km/h (and the Eglinton LRT slower, due to increased stop spacing), I can't imagine that this route isn't faster to go downtown than connecting with the originally planned Eglinton LRT at Renforth and slogging across the city that way."

mississauga,32ajuc,Ahhmedical,-6,Sun Apr 12 05:55:07 2015 UTC,Yeah but it's the content they're teaching them teen pregnancy is high cause of all the Sexualized content we see in the media giving them the knowledge is just putting the gun in there hand. I'm sure the parents will know when the best time to talk to their own children not every kid goes through puberty the same age having that connection with the parent. Also having the talk further develops the relationship between parent and child and won't be as awkward talking to your teacher after a math test.
mississauga,32ajuc,lethal_weapon_five,7,Sun Apr 12 06:53:25 2015 UTC,I'm sure the parents will know when the best time to talk to their own children not every kid goes through puberty the same age having that connection with the parent.    lol. There is no test to be a parent. No qualifications and most parents are idiots.   It is better to have professionals teach it using statistics and evidence based practices to educate the next generation.
mississauga,32ajuc,Ahhmedical,-5,Sun Apr 12 07:12:14 2015 UTC,"What professionals are you talking about? They're not bringing anyone new they're gonna hand the teacher a book to read off to the kids. And you're parents raised you didn't they clearly they had some idea and weren't complete morons. And what does statistics have to do with teaching  a kid how to put  a condom on, its not math class."
mississauga,32ajuc,lethal_weapon_five,6,Sun Apr 12 11:04:49 2015 UTC,"Well my parents were educated. They raised an educated kid. A kid that went on to be a RN  As a part of my job I do patient teaching. At times to teens and I can say their knowledge of sex, sex organs and functions, STD and Pregnancy prevention is extremely lacking.  Parents do no feel comfortable talking about these issues. Leaving it up to them has continually failed.  Teen Mom did more to reduce teen pregnancy rates than any conversation with a parent ever did."
mississauga,32ajuc,CaptainBloodloss,5,Sun Apr 12 11:51:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no... your kids are idiots. This is coming from someone who used to teach.  In regards to unprotected sex, I remember kids says ""It's okay... just use Plan B"", without having a clue as to the kind of damage that does to the body (and I'm speaking here of high school kids)."
mississauga,32ajuc,Ahhmedical,-3,Sun Apr 12 07:18:08 2015 UTC,"I don't have kids lol. But of course they should teach students passed puberty about that shit... Oh wait they already are,  by high school students should have participated in sex ed classes by middle school. Omg what a great job they're doing right!  /s. Don't get me wrong of course sex ed needs to be updated in regards to the content not the age groups."
mississauga,32ajuc,Avagis,3,Sun Apr 12 11:09:33 2015 UTC,teen pregnancy is high   That's absolutely not true.

mississauga,32a60i,jddsa,3,Sat Apr 11 23:54:21 2015 UTC,I mostly shop online. I buy about 80% of my clothes online. I rarely go clothing shopping though. I might be one of the few women who hates shopping. If I go into a store I go to Old Navy or Soft Moc or Tommy Hilfiger or Eddie Bauer or The Gap.
mississauga,32a60i,JoanOfArctic,2,Sun Apr 12 00:59:47 2015 UTC,I'm with you.  Love online shopping - but I only shop where they ship free and let me return to store free.

T-max heat?  I had to buy them for a surgery once and I was pissed at the time (force me to buy expensive fuckin socks, jackasses) but I've ended up getting so much use out of them... They don't really fit into shoes but they are wonderful for cold snowy days spent inside vegging with the husband, the pets, netflix & tea."

mississauga,32a60i,caretotry_theseagain,1 point,Sun Apr 12 02:17:23 2015 UTC,Shopping is the worst. It sucks. I hate it so hard. I buy like one pair of pants a year and wear them under they're threadbare and fall off my body.
mississauga,32a60i,JoanOfArctic,1 point,Sun Apr 12 04:28:17 2015 UTC,so how do you go about sizing? dont different brands fit differently?
mississauga,32a60i,JoanOfArctic,2,Sun Apr 12 06:04:31 2015 UTC,For me tops are the same at the stores I shop at. I stick to my crew neck sweaters and plain old t shirts and polos. For my dress shirts I have to go into the store because women's dress shirts differ wildly. For skirts and pants I have to go into a store. If I'm ordering something I've ordered before I just order the same thing. I hate shopping so much though that I only go in once a year and I stock up. I take a day during the middle of the week to go when it's not busy.
mississauga,32a60i,TheWorthlessProfit,1 point,Sun Apr 12 13:53:13 2015 UTC,coool! thanks for the detailed answer. it makes complete sense however. What about shoes?
mississauga,32a60i,jswift79,1 point,Sun Apr 12 14:25:49 2015 UTC,The last time I bought new shoes was 3 years ago. I bought a pair of Josef Seibels from the Soft Moc website. My size is standard. I wear a 6.5 or 7 so for casual shoes or boots I always know a 7 will fit. If I buy heels I have to go in and try it. I haven't bought new heels in yearssss. I take really good care of my shoes so that I don't have to buy new ones.
mississauga,32a60i,Slugette,3,Sun Apr 12 14:33:01 2015 UTC,"A large proportion of my wardrobe (both professional and casual) comes from Forever 21.  I check the new arrivals on their website at least once a week.  My jeans are Old Navy.  I also bought a lot of things from Marshalls/Winners a while back, but I started striking out there regularly and haven't been in a good while.  My husband's casual wardrobe is largely from Old Navy.  He also has some work shirts from there but not too many - their colours are a little garish.  His work pants are Banana from the outlet - he's pretty slim and 6' tall so it can be tough to find pants that fit.  We've had some luck with trousers at H&M as well.  Chinos seem to be a thing right now, but I just feel like they're wearable lint and pet hair magnets.  We buy the odd thing at Joe Fresh (mainly from seeing it on sale while grabbing lunch), Mexx's slim fit shirts were perfect for my husband but I guess they are no more."
mississauga,32a60i,acamu5,1 point,Sun Apr 12 02:15:53 2015 UTC,I totally forgot about Joe Fresh! That place is great. I hate malls so going into a Joe Fresh when the store isn't busy is heaven.

I tell myself oh I'll just head over to superstore and grab a salad for $5.  Leave with $60 receipt for sweater, two shirts for hubby, onesies for cousin's newest sprog and a salad.  AND I had to pay for a damn plastic bag because I was only going in for a goddamn salad."

mississauga,327rmu,KimJongIll-est,6,Sat Apr 11 09:08:23 2015 UTC,"Hey, someone close to me has gone through similar things, but other than that I'm no expert.  I'm also not going to tell you what you want to hear.  First of all, your current doc is probably 100% right in treating your mdd prior to attempting to treat any underlying adhd. The reason is simple: they want to get you stabilized on your antidepressant before putting you on a stimulant like adderall, which is probably contraindicated (ie they can't give it to you at all) due to your insomnia.  There is also the fact that you may not have adhd at all - cognitive impairment (difficulty concentrating, making decisions etc.) is another fun symptom of mdd.  A recently launched antidepressant called trintellix is supposed to help with these cognitive symptoms - you might want to ask your doctor about it.  Not covered under odb though so I hope you have an awesome drug plan.  Finally, good luck getting better. It's a lot harder than most people realize, and it's going to take a lot of work from you. There are a number of classes offered through trillium on an out patient basis that help you to do things like recognize disordered thinking and coping mechanisms for when you are feeling down, etc.   This thing you're doing isn't impossible, especially if you're getting professional help."

mississauga,322zq9,nicos13,2,Fri Apr 10 03:58:35 2015 UTC,"They have a bunch of different people but essentially all they really end up doing is listing your house on MLS and arranging pictures. They're barebones and don't do much else. If that's what you need and want - they'll be fine.  You can do pretty much what you'd get done by a company like OPR yourself using a self listing site like ComFree or PropertyGuys. You're paying OPR thousands to do what the self-listing sites will do for hundreds.  There are good real estate agents that will charge more than OPR and actually do a decent job for the full services those realtors provide. Remember, most realtors will negotiate so you could get all the services that a regular full service realtor provides for not much more than OPR would charge you, if you want that.  Lastly, as someone who has bought and sold a few houses with some great realtors and have also self-listed, no matter which realtor you pick - don't trust them. They get paid when you buy or sell a house. They will always favour you agreeing to a transaction even if it's not the optimal deal for you."
mississauga,322zq9,EGOP,2,Fri Apr 10 10:28:42 2015 UTC,"I'll jump on here as I'm a Mississauga agent myself. I won't get into how it's insulting to say to never trust a realtor, but that's a topic for another day.   Anyways, the biggest flaw with OPR is what they offer the buying agent. Because they don't offer a full commission (2.5%), many agents won't show your home. And many agents will tell their client that because the seller is not offering a full commission, that their client will have to make up the difference. That does a good job putting off the buyer who doesn't want to drop an extra $7K upfront paying a commission when purchasing.   Do yourself a favour and either self-list with someone like ComFree or negotiate with a full-service realtor. The days are gone where the full-service realtor is going to charge you 2.5% on their end. You can negotiate this down to 1-1.5% (3.5-4% total) and then not have to worry about all the marketing, arranging of showings, paperwork and negotiations.   In the end, if you want to sell your home relatively quickly, then make sure you always offer 2.5% to the buying agent. That's the key to attracting the most amount of attention from other agents. If you risk that by trying to save on the commission then you're risking losing potentially $10K+ on the actual home sale as your home stagnates. And that can happen even in the type of market we have right now."

mississauga,3213cw,needsaplaceasap,6,Thu Apr 9 18:58:29 2015 UTC,"Within your price range, within mississauga/ burlington/ oakville, you will be living with roommates.  $500 is the price of a room these days.  A standalone place can be got for 900, but that will be pretty crappy, and may not include utilities.  With your income, roommates may well be the only option, I'm afraid.  On the bright side (literally) you should be able to get a room above ground for that price and your cat will be happier with a window to gaze out of.  You don't mention whether you drive or take public transport?  If the former, your insurance will probably increase once you are no longer living with your parent, and so you will need to take this into account.  If the latter, the location of your future place is more important since ideally you would have fewer buses to change to on your daily commute.  I think the best thing for you to do may be to call 311 and ask to be put through to the appropriate community agency. Your school may also have resources for you.  You absolutely do qualify for these services since without them, in two weeks you will be homeless."

The website will give you practically every listing for apartments in your area and there price ranges. When you say that you have a cat, you have now increased the amount of money you need to live on. Let me put it into perspective for you. My girlfriend, her roommate, and I, were all looking for a place to live that was cheap and affordable. We found apartments for as low as 1100 for two bedrooms and the one bedrooms were around 800-1000. The problem here is that my girlfriend decided on a cat, so we had to adjust our search to apartments or places that accepted cats, and that was killer. Our available places decreased by about 78% and the prices of all the leftover places went up by about 200. That is mainly because pets are costly and they increased your living expenses.   Here is what I found for you using walkscore. https://www.walkscore.com/apartments/search/CA-ON/Mississauga  https://www.walkscore.com/score/7165-village-walk-mississauga-on-canada?rid=52_b_113968989  https://www.walkscore.com/score/376-hyacinthe-blvd-mississauga-on-canada?rid=52_b_114448795  https://www.walkscore.com/score/1495-andros-blvd-mississauga-on-canada?rid=52_b_115563866  Just so you know some of these places are in Brampton and they are cheaper. The reason for that is because towards Brampton you are entering a lower populated area where living is inexpensive.  You could also use padmapper.com Which is sort of like walkscore but may be more helpful to you. Here are a few places I found for you.  http://toronto.en.craigslist.ca/mss/roo/4930216362.html  http://toronto.en.craigslist.ca/mss/roo/4964537381.html  http://toronto.en.craigslist.ca/mss/roo/4937597008.html  http://www.padmapper.com/show.php?source=5&id=227548395&src=main  http://toronto.en.craigslist.ca/mss/roo/4961733820.html  This is what I could find in your price range. If you need any help looking for an apartment, you can PM me. Also if you are looking for any work I can help you obtain some temporary jobs. The only thing is that you need to be willing to work and be willing to travel as far as Toronto. If your interested the job is closing the TTC Subway stations.   Good Luck on your apartment searching."

I think this fare hike is to make up for the express route down Eastgate Pkwy - Eglinton that I never seem to see anyone use. Mississauga's transit is becoming more expensive, while being just as or less reliable than the TTC.

mississauga,31hq0e,jake_naylor,3,Sun Apr 5 04:36:53 2015 UTC,"This was a ton of fun yesterday. Loads more reptiles/spiders/creepy-crawlies there than last year. Lots of dog/cat breeds represented as well as Guinea pigs and birds. It was fun to see attendees with their various pets and the venue wisely avoided using carpeting this year. Although crowded, the aisles were wide enough that you could still move around. The food area was much better situated and organized this year than last as well.  I have a ticket I didn't use yesterday (my friend and I got in free), so if someone wants it for today, message me."
mississauga,31f3mq,thisiscome,6,Sat Apr 4 13:58:12 2015 UTC,"Do you have fiber running directly into your unit? If so, which building? (If you don't mind me asking).  You should still have a phone line and cable line running into your unit, so I don't see why they can't service you. Unless the building itself has an exclusive contract with an ISP and they split the cost between the owners. If this is the case, ask your property manager about it as this would be the cheapest option for you. They had plans of doing this at several buildings in Canada, get a high throughput connectrion for the entire building and share it amongst the owners. Didn't know they had accomplished this in Mississauga though.  Rogers recently ran fiber into my building, then installed a node to distribute it to all the units. So in my apartment I still have a traditional cable line, but in the basement it hooks directly into the fiber network. I've had much better stability and way lower pings after they did that."
mississauga,31f3mq,karlos349,3,Sat Apr 4 14:06:43 2015 UTC,We have our fiber through Distributel...I think they use Bell's fiber line but you don't have to deal with/pay for Bell.
mississauga,31f3mq,bubbles1286,3,Sat Apr 4 17:03:00 2015 UTC,"My building is also new (built last year) and I was told by teksavvy that they could offer me my phone no prob, but inter was exclusive to bell/rogers with no wiggle room.  I am now paying said arm and leg and the speed of this fiber is little to nothing.    I use internet A LOT. Speed is nearly same, and the last 4 weeks has been dropping wan connection just about hourly.  And forget talking to tech support.    When I set it up, I couldn't access my FTP I have on my home PC from outside (work etc) and I wanted then to drop whatever firewall they had on the modem/router.  Well that was a shit show.  Literally no level of tech was even aware of how internet protocols actually work and what I was asking.  The top tier CHARGES to attempt to help, and I was clear I did not want to talk to them, I still got bumped there anyways and they for at least no chares admitted they had no idea what I was asking either.  I thankfully wound a work around myself.    And word to the wise, don't get blindsided by their numours introductory offers.  Those discounts will enviably end.  Ask about the code AFTER it ends.  It will scare you sometimes."
mississauga,31f3mq,silentdragon14,1 point,Sat Apr 4 16:59:22 2015 UTC,"I've heard of two companies that provide fibre internet to condos at really high speeds. I think this is one of them: http://www.fibrestream.ca/  I think they have to set it up with your entire Condo first, not sure."
mississauga,31f3mq,bipolargraph,0,Sun Apr 5 03:15:53 2015 UTC,"Depends strictly where you are. If you can avoid rogers, do so. Check with bell if they have the unlimited internet option available, and insist you do not want a fucking bundle. They're trained to say it saves you money if you get a bundle even if you just want only internet, which is not the case whatsoever. I pay 115 taxes included for a copper@home-Fiber@node, 50down 25up, no data caps, 20 less than their retarded bundle offer they claim is cheaper. Ping for LoL is between 67-80 always, depending on time of day. Rogers couldn't match the bell offer, and I am having trouble getting another ISP that can match speed, no data cap and price."
mississauga,31f3mq,caretotry_theseagain,1 point,Sun Apr 5 09:32:41 2015 UTC,"I'm by no means a supporter of Rogers, but if you want to get access to higher tier speeds you really do need to go with Rogers or Bell. I currently have the 30 mbit package from Distributel for $70 w/tax, but Rogers just redid all their plans and it's making me reconsider.  Their top 2 plans are unlimited now, 250/20 for $107 w/tax and 100/10 for $96 w/tax (Includes modem). Might be worth seeing if Bell can match that.   A part of me actually want to switch back to Rogers... and it scares me. But 250 mbit (8x my current speed!) for an extra $40~ a month is enticing."
mississauga,31dqz5,vozdra78,8,Sat Apr 4 02:35:35 2015 UTC,"There is literally tons of garbage in the heart of Riverwood park.  Some of it is very old, such as these Canada Dry bottles.

mississauga,31dqz5,karlos349,3,Sat Apr 4 02:41:55 2015 UTC,It's probably still there because either it hasn't been reported or they don't do inspections or they don't care.

mississauga,31dzv3,MLEYjlBRT8,4,Sat Apr 4 04:08:38 2015 UTC,"What time do you have to start work? And where is work? How long is the walk from Union to work.   Usually the train on the Milton line is late, but only by 5-10 minutes (waiting for platform at Union). Once in while there are signal issues, or freight train traffic which causes longer delays (up to 30 minutes). Also, not sure if you are aware, if the train is more than 15 minutes late, you can get your money back.   If you are starting at 9 am, the 7:35 is a good bet. I usually take the 7:50 from Meadowvale and get to work before 9 am.  If you have any more questions, let me know. I take the train from Meadowvale everyday."
mississauga,31dzv3,ricas77,2,Sat Apr 4 12:46:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info!  I want to get to work by 9 am. Office is at King & Spadina. Hoping to get to Union station by 8:30 at the latest, and then catch the King streetcar west to Spadina. I've heard the streetcars are jam-packed and people need to wait for one or two to pass by before they can get on one. So, not sure what I'll do if that happens. Maybe a better idea to take subway to St Andrew station and then just walk from there.  Do you just walk from Union?"
mississauga,31dzv3,rdrrbartrdrr,2,Sat Apr 4 19:23:51 2015 UTC,I would and have walked plenty of times instead of waiting for that streetcar
mississauga,31dzv3,ricas77,1 point,Sat Apr 4 19:25:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, I walk from Union. But I'm only 5 minutes away.   If you want to walk (which I would recommend), you can exit at York west and you're probably about 10-15 minutes walk to King & Spadina. Unfortunately, the path doesn't go to King and Spadina, so you would have to walk outside, which is easy when it isn't cold.  Over time you will find your preferred method of getting to work. I'm sure you will have co-workers that also commute on the train. Ask around, they will let you know their way."

They also have a great selection of film. In Mississauga, Black's and Henry's can do it, but I think it takes too long to get you photos back.

Not sure as I never shoot in that format.  Sad state of affairs but I personally got bored with digital to the point of being close to sell my DSLR. My plan is to keep a competent P&S around for ""snapshot"" photography as well as some of my personal product photgraphy, but use my medium and large format camera for all my serious work.

I babysat from when I was 10 and worked in a restaurant kitchen when I was 14 as a prep cook and dishwasher.  At 16 I worked as a farm labourer (and no, it wasn't some family friend type of deal - I answered an ad in the paper.  I was a little odd for a 16 year old girl.)  These days, there are more people my age going for low wage work that was typically relegated to teenagers - so the teenagers are facing competition in that sphere.  Also, people seem to have lost trust in their childrens' intelligence and maturity, since people hire babysitters to watch 10 year olds instead of hiring 10 year olds as babysitters.  If I was OP, I'd invest in a lawnmower, and go door to door offering to cut peoples' lawns.  Get cards with your number/email on them so people can call you back.  Personally, I'd probably pay just to reward the entrepreneurial spirit.  In winter, do driveways.  Great way to get into some serious shape.  If nobody will hire you, create your own job."

Also I found that most places in the area offer free 6 months of car parking either in the basement or on the surface. Depending on where you are thinking of living, whether it be near someplace busy such as Square One, or a little more quiet like Sheridan Center, you will get different prices. I find that the closer you are to Square One the more fast paced it is, plus the convenience of a shopping mall. The Monroe buildings are absolutely beautiful and have great security and lovely buildings, a little pricey but for the area it's worth it. If you are looking for a place further away I would recommend condos and apartments closer to Brampton and Port Credit, as they tend to be cheaper.

Most buildings can be attributed to their property managers. Run away from First Service Residential (now known as Simerra) and if you can, talk to the property manager. If they make themselves available to you, it's a good sign they'll listen to your concerns.

Small detail, First Service actually bought out several property management companies, including Simerra. I went to double check their website but it is literally the most frustrating site I've ever visited. But you're right, stay far away. I've heard nothing but bad things about them.

mississauga,2zlafd,charliethelion,13,Thu Mar 19 15:06:44 2015 UTC,"I lived in 'The Residences' for 5 months with my wife until I couldn't take it anymore.   Neighbour committed suicide by jumping from the balcony. His girlfriend came out in the hallway screaming and waking everyone up at 8 AM on the weekend. I still have not been able to get that out of my head 8 months later. Razor-thin walls. One neighbour would play music past midnight every week. Called the concierge on him 3 times and even though they said on the 3rd time they would call the cops they didn't. I could hear the other neighbours from my living room because they were just 'a bit too loud'. Needless to say the sound deadening really sucks. Amenities were always crowded by Indian families with their 6 kids. Did not matter if it was a week day or weekend, the fire lounge, games room and other common amenities were unusable 90% of the time. Arabic kids (with their rich parents of course) being absolutely insane and management not doing much about it. 3 of them got banned from the computer room and their access card would not work anymore. They started running into the door and smacking it with objects trying to get in. They got someone else's card and got in anyway disturbing everyone there. And oh yeah, the sign in there said 'No unsupervised kids under 16 years of age'. No 'real' visitor parking. P1 is shared with the retail portion of the plaza so if you have any visitors, you have to grab a pass for them AND go down with them to P1, otherwise they will have a hard time getting into the building as they need an access card. Related to what derpage said, the floor-to-ceiling windows are absolute garbage. They squeak and crack like I have never seen before and I have friends that were living on the 30th floor in other buildings and nothing of the sort happened. Construction - Yup, PSV 2 is still under construction, your 'driveway' in front of the building is barely useable and you get construction noise every morning.   My last subjective comment - The people in the building absolutely suck. Most are renters and they don't give a shit about their apartment, the building or anyone else. You'll find people that don't even speak English and can't operate an elevator, crazy kids like I mentioned and people who leave their trash all over the place when the garbage chutes are closed for the night.  And god help you if you get a parking spot in P4 or P5 and you have to go to work every day. I would work from home and the endless circles I had to make in the underground parking would drive me insane and would take 5 minutes for me to even get out of the garage.  But hey, you can do what everyone else does in the building and just buy a condo and rent it out. Then you will never have to deal with the crap that is PSV. It's no wonder that when they tried to hold an annual owners meeting where they needed 70 condo owners to show up. only 7 responded and the meeting got cancelled."

mississauga,2zhqgk,k285,2,Wed Mar 18 18:55:43 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but a lifelong Mississaugan(?). If that's the case, Viet/Japanese cuisine is for you. Reasonably healthy, quick, and bursting with flavour. IMO it trumps anything you could get at say BP or Jack Astor's - hot and fresh soup trumps pizza or a massive bowl of pasta any day of the week. Ethnic foods in general seem to have this down."
mississauga,2zhqgk,GRVNT,3,Mon Mar 30 05:08:51 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend Chiu Chow Man at Burnhamthorpe and Mavis then. Amazing chinese, with a great menu to choose from.. Be sure to ask if you aren't familiar though cause its the type of place you can end up ordering an octopus on top of a hunk of pork fat or something. Been a family favorite (we're east indian) for years, so its guaranteed to be spicy. You can definitely get healthier options as well (my mom is vegetarian and my dad has (genetically) high blood pressure)"
mississauga,2zhqgk,rummuds,1 point,Wed Mar 18 18:39:42 2015 UTC,"Quite frankly, OP nailed it with his suggestions. Viet food tends to be lighter. Try Pho Mi 99 at Grand Park and Bthorpe or Pho Dau Bo at Creditview and Bristol.   Some Japanese can also be healthy. However, the current explosion in the popularity of sushi is not doing anything for anyone's waistlines. I try and stick to dishes heavy on the veg and meat in place of carbs. Kenzo is very close to me and very accessible - I didn't realize soup could taste so incredible."

Owl of Minerva (by the BTrust store on Central Parkway and Burnhamthorpe). The #25 reminds me of General Tao Chicken. Lazziz (Creditview and Brittania) for Shawarma. Fortune Dragon (same plaza as Lazziz) delivers decent Chinese food. Sam Woo on Mavis and Eglington for decent Chinese food hong Kong style.

mississauga,2zi9s1,YurieSigtuna,4,Wed Mar 18 20:21:08 2015 UTC,"Never heard of that formulation, so I can't say where to get it. However, Mersyndol contains:  Acetaminophen - 325mg, Codeine - 8mg, Doxylamine - 5mg  You can nearly replicate the effect by combining Tylonol 1 (Acetaminophen - 300mg, Codeine - 8mg, Caffeine - 15mg) with a partial/half dose of Nyquil Cough (Dextromethorphan - 30mg, Doxylamine - 12.5mg per 30ml).  You end up with 15mg of caffeine and 15mg of dextromethorphan that you wouldn't otherwise, but at those dosages the effects should be minimal. Unfortunately I haven't been able to find any pure formulation for doxylamine since Unisom 2 was taken off the market, otherwise I would have suggested that in place of the Nyquil Cough. On the other hand, if you take a full dose of the Nyquil Cough about an hour before taking the Tylonol 1s, the dextromethorphan will temporarily help minimise any tolerance you may have developed to codeine."

mississauga,2z5iew,aaffpp,6,Sun Mar 15 19:40:08 2015 UTC,I really wanted to love my Wind Phone.  And I guess for the first while I did.  But there wasn't much point in having unlimited data if it couldn't load google search results... maybe they've improved in the past year.
mississauga,2z5iew,JoanOfArctic,4,Mon Mar 16 01:55:35 2015 UTC,"Been with wind for half a year now, its not the coverage that you would have issues with,  in fact i notice they're slowly filling up these dead zones within the city. It's the poor frequency that cannot penetrate most inner concrete parts of buildings. Like, if you go to Square One,  you would'nt get decent reception in the new foodcourt wing."
mississauga,2z5iew,paksman,4,Sun Mar 15 23:09:28 2015 UTC,It's not THE best and the data is fairly slow. But I guess that's what you get for $35/mo.
mississauga,2z5iew,MeinNeger_,4,Sun Mar 15 23:03:39 2015 UTC,"I've been with Wind for over a year now and have had no problems with reception. Customer service has been good too.

mississauga,2z5iew,BigRig40,1 point,Sun Mar 15 22:00:44 2015 UTC,Does your experience match up wiith the map. Sometimes they publish for PR purposes.
mississauga,2z5iew,BigRig40,3,Sun Mar 15 23:35:40 2015 UTC,"In my experience, it does.  I've had a signals in Kitchener, Guelph, Newmarket, Kingston, and downtown Toronto.  The only area I run into issues with is the 401 between Milton and Guelph but its not covered by the Wind network on the map."
mississauga,2z5iew,ferocis,-3,Mon Mar 16 00:59:35 2015 UTC,Astroturf much?
mississauga,2z5iew,BigRig40,4,Mon Mar 16 02:46:12 2015 UTC,Nope. Just a happy Wind customer who goes out of his way to ensure that Bell and Rogers don't get any of his money.
mississauga,2z5iew,anonymous-shad0w,2,Mon Mar 16 11:17:16 2015 UTC,"For me, it may be my phone (2013 Moto G), but I think coverage is average at best. Lots of dead zones which gets really annoying, especially when I don't get reception at ACC (I know that's not Mississauga or Brampton) if I go watch a raps game. But for the price it's definitely worth it."
mississauga,2z5iew,Pierrechen,2,Mon Mar 16 00:34:06 2015 UTC,Two years and going strong. Just when I am in Markham there is this dead spot about one block radius. HTC is best to pair with wind.

If there are other holes, I haven't noticed them.  I've been with Wind for a couple years now, and haven't had any real complaints.  They have coverage in about 90% of the places I travel, so I haven't had issues, including Windsor, LaSalle and Amherstburg.  I've used it in Ottawa and Kingston too with no problems."
mississauga,2z5iew,TwistedxRainbow,2,Mon Mar 16 02:33:40 2015 UTC,"I'm overall very happy being under Wind, however I do lose reception occasionally, for some reason it is often when I'm at Square One or the bus terminal."

Both my wife and I have been with wind for 2 years now, and her Sony xperia zl had perfect reception and my lg g2 sitting right beside hers would have zero bars. With my lg, mobile data was pretty much nonexistent. I just switched to the moto g and reception is perfect."

Outside of the GTA service is spotty. In Guelph and Kitchener it's strong. In Hamilton and Niagara its poor in my experience. In Sarnia it switched me to T-Mobile the whole time even though I was 10km from the border. Rural areas you are completely screwed.   Customer service is bad but really they all are. I had to be on the phone for an hour and a half to fix a mischarging issue because people kept transferring me to other people and two people straight up hung up on me. I wasn't yelling or being hostile probably they just didn't know what to do. Still its a budget phone service. You get what you pay for."
mississauga,2z5iew,lubpud,1 point,Sun Mar 15 22:45:41 2015 UTC,"I found they have terrible service. I tried on multiple devices. The network is the issue, not the phone. I needed a provider that's reliable, not one that cuts out constantly and doesn't get service in large pockets around the city, so I ended up cancelling my service and switching. Their customer service call centre is horrendous too."

mississauga,2z6leu,yawaramin,2,Mon Mar 16 03:15:39 2015 UTC,"I'd at least let them know, and leave your name and number.  I don't see anything wrong with trying to return it yourself.  Mostly because I don't trust someone else to not steal it from wherever you hand it in.  If I find something, and I'm willing to put the time into returning it, I go for it.  Someone else might just toss it aside and forget about it."
mississauga,2z6leu,swrdfish,0,Mon Mar 16 04:53:21 2015 UTC,We thought about that but an active search for the owner seems like a better idea than just leaving it in a pile of junk doomed forevermore.
mississauga,2z6leu,RAND0M-HER0,2,Mon Mar 16 11:11:32 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. If the owner doesn't use Reddit, how the heck are they supposed to find it? They'd retrace their steps, and if it's not there, they assume it's stolen and they'll stop looking."

mississauga,2z6leu,RAND0M-HER0,1 point,Mon Mar 16 18:15:28 2015 UTC,No we looked at all that. No emails or anything other than a first name could be recovered. And it's a fairly common name. We figure that a name and description of the case would be enough to verify.

Got him to detail my car that was ridiculously dirty and full of dog hair (everywhere!). He did it quick, also did other stuff like patch a spot on my steering wheel that had the fabric ripped and also coloured in spot that was supposed to be black but had chipped and turned white.  Didn't take him long, either. He's my go to guy for detailing and body repair. I highly recommend. Better service than the Auto Spa and much cheaper."

mississauga,2ypaeb,liftcannabis,6,Wed Mar 11 18:07:14 2015 UTC,"I'm sort of interested, so breezed through some of the documents.  highlights:  Annual licenses required.  $250/year initial, $200 to renew.  Like most licensed businesses, inspections are required.  licensing fees are typical of other businesses and are designed to offset the cost of inspections.  There are 4 medical marijuana production facilities in the city currently.  They will need to meet new criteria.  (sort of interesting there are 4 operating now)  Zoning stuff... separation of production facilities from sensitive sites (residences, schools, day nurseries, places of worship 70 meters to 200 meters).   sort of obvious things that relate to fire/emergency services.  Some no brainers about waste destruction inside the facilities.  Being mississauga has no more agricultural zoning (WOW times have changed) they will be zoned in with industrial/business employment zoning.  security stuff.  no signage.  security 24/7. etc.  Seems very vanilla and common sense to the point i got bored and stopped reading it.  If there is a spoiler at the end lemme know."

Based on the contract they will have to pay a fine of $150 a day up to a max of $7,500 to all the homeowners each day after June 2015 surely this will cause some incentive for them to finish by then no?"

I'm curious as to what your definition of a reasonable quote would be. The GTA and certain part of Mississauga in particular have some of the highest rates in the country.  In any case, it sound like you're shopping around. Make sure you try a variety of types (banks, direct writers, brokers). If you're still living with your parents there should be some discount available there.

mississauga,2yl5ax,2BigBottlesOfWater,2,Thu Mar 12 07:34:25 2015 UTC,I believe that's their way of hiding the company name so you don't go directly to them.  Try following through with the quote and you should surely be able or know the company before you commit.  But they only added the 'your lowest quote' thing recently so I'm not 100% on how it works.

The ingenie guy said quotes were like $2.5k per year or something and based on data recorded it could go down up to 35% if the sensor records 'good' driving habits.  I am conflicted on the 'big brother' thing being i do not know their metrics if going 120km/hr is going to ding someone on the 401 in off-peak times where not going that fast is dangerous... but sounded like something worth checking out.  edit: fixed link

In said contracts the reserve the right to make changes, these have to either be mailed to you, which sometimes show up in the fine print on your bill, or in some way communicated to you. From that point on you have 30 days to ""refuse"" changes to the contract and get out of it early, otherwise you have automagically accepted the altered terms of the contract with your silence.

Did the passenger not look back to see if any traffic was coming before stepping out?   I also feel like the truck driver drove off a bit, because of his speed perhaps. Regardless, he returned to the scene. Trucks are huge, it could take some of these guys 15+ minutes to find a spot to turn the fuck around and get back to the scene.

There's been many complaints about the legal grow-ups and some regulation on where to put them and ventilation/odour control makes a lot of sense.  Sort of sad in a way that so many people are racing to make a fortune in the pot rush that they didn't have the common sense to set it up properly so a municipal government is now stepping in to bylaw it.

There are lots of carbon filter technologies that could effectively remove the odor.  Costly, but if it was done right in the first place they could have a grow-up in an industrial plaza and unless they wanted to advertise their location, none of the neighbours would be the wiser.  Grow something like hops in the same way... it'd go just as bad."

It works out to like $30/month for MiWay (0.75 x 40 trips), add that to whatever it costs to get from Cooksville to Union on GO. It's worth it for the convenience and time you'll save over taking the bus to the subway.  Buy a Presto card and it handles the fares automatically."

mississauga,2xwwnl,number8888,8,Thu Mar 5 05:34:06 2015 UTC,"The only other alternative that I know of is to take the bus to Islington station and get on the subway, which will save you just under $3 per trip over the course of the month when compared to the bus/GO option. However the trip will take longer on average (I would wager approximately an extra 30 minutes each way), and the Bloor subway fucking blows, so it all depends on how much you value your time and sanity.  In the summer she might also want to consider biking down Confederation using the dedicated bike lanes."

mississauga,2xmmak,little_steven,4,Mon Mar 2 19:37:00 2015 UTC,"From what I hear, they study full time and work part time. They make 13-14k a year but want at least the minimum to meet the average. They have expenses like the rest if us and surely some of it goes back towards their studying. I seriously think they should get this because they are very important. Let's be honest, TA's are a major role of the young people's education and have a significant impact. If I made 13k for leading the studying population of the future, I'd be pissed too."
mississauga,2xmmak,2BigBottlesOfWater,-2,Mon Mar 2 20:23:27 2015 UTC,"They're assistants, not professors or lecturers. Them striking doesn't affect my learning experience one bit. Being a TA is meant to subsidize their tuition costs, not allow them to put down a mortgage on house.  I might concede that graduate and PhD level TAs deserve more but the vast majority of those striking are undergraduate TAs. It's embarrassing how greedy they are."
mississauga,2xmmak,little_steven,0,Mon Mar 2 20:44:27 2015 UTC,"Many do a lot of work. And why shouldn't they be able to put a down payment on a house? For choosing to follow this path? They can't even put down 5% at this rate. Heck even if they get $25,000/yr that's a full years salary towards just 5% of a +/- 400k house or condo - which is still below average. Welcome to the real world, where people want and need to buy things to get ahead. 13k is a joke from any standard."
mississauga,2xmmak,2BigBottlesOfWater,-2,Mon Mar 2 21:55:38 2015 UTC,No 13k is pretty damn good for a part time job.
mississauga,2xmmak,little_steven,2,Mon Mar 2 22:25:55 2015 UTC,"I don't know the breaktown of TAs at UTM, but when I was in grad school at a different university the vast majority of TAs in my department were grad students. While I was there, I was putting 60-80 hours a week into directly helping the university's research, and the only way they allowed me to make money was by being a TA. If I wanted another outside job (not that I had the time to), I would need the permission of my supervisor which he would likely not grant.   For many departments, grad school isn't like undergrad at all- your main task is your thesis, which is usually a component of your professor's research, which brings in a ton of money to the university. It's not like the rest of the time these students are sitting in class not contributing to anything.   It's also not like other jobs where you can just get another part time job."

mississauga,2xan6d,EpsilonSteve,4,Fri Feb 27 12:54:04 2015 UTC,"Mississauga could have turned into Brampton. She developed the city into an economic power house but largely failed to make it culturally relevant.  Edit: I think its disingenuous to put so much blame on her. Mississauga, the city, was only established in the 70s prior to which it was 3 smaller towns. Urban planning on such a scale is a nightmare but still, I'd say it could have been worse. I think people are forgetting that the city of Mississauga is only 41 years old.   A walkable downtown? Thats being developed now.  Transportation? Were still fucked. But we also have to ask what we want. Do we want a comprehensive and convenient public transit or one that is able to operate at a break even or profitable level? That is the nature of public transit.  Green space? I can think of a lot of rather large parks. I don't know that I'd agree with you on the matter but I don't know that I would disagree with you either.  I want to be clear that I'm not sucking on geriatric tits. I'm trying to have a fair view of things. Kindly correct me where you see fit to."
mississauga,2xan6d,dbcanuck,6,Fri Feb 27 13:18:21 2015 UTC,"No I think we're on the same page. Mississauga is better than Markham or Brampton, but a lot of mistakes were made.   The biggest issue is they should have built a big reserve fund for future expenditure when the city was growing. Now its mature, and aside from putting in some painful title change taxes or raising rates substantially, the city is going to struggle the next few decades with investments.   EDIT: In fairness, I think Port Credit is coming along nicely as a destination neighbourhood; they need to do the same with Streetsville and Clarkson Village. Square One is now the center of the city...and its an indoor mall. Not sure that's a good way to build your city core."
mississauga,2xan6d,MoeVsWORLD,2,Fri Feb 27 14:06:23 2015 UTC,Greenspace is probably #1. Ever done the drive from pearson? Probably the most dreary way to introduce people into our country. Especially if you compare it to something like gatwick airport
mississauga,2xan6d,EpsilonSteve,1 point,Fri Feb 27 15:10:54 2015 UTC,I typically take the highway to and from Pearson. A quick commute has always been more valuable to me than scenery. That and it just makes economic sense to develop airport land into a dark and dingy dungeon of industry.  I'll concede the point however. I like what were doing with the lakeshore and that the city managed to work with landowners to develop a lot of green space with it. Have you seen the plans they have for the lakeshore development? Its AWESOME.  We have the park on Mississauga rd and dundas. And then streetsville is connected to another very spacious green land. Also by the credit river you have a lot of green space. And then there is that conservatory by burnhamthorpe and creditview.  My complaint would be that the green space is really limited to two regions of the city and you can really only get to it by traveling a fair distance if you don't already live there.  Edit: they should convert the roof of sq1 into a garden. Fence it up so people don't fall off. Have a bocce court and maybe some stalls in the summer serving snow cones. It would have to be modular so you can take it down for the winter. Tarp over whatever you need to. That would be dope as hell.

So, a couple years ago they came in and pitched doing the parking enforcement for no cost to the condo corp, but at the same time the ticket revenue doesn't go back to the condo corp... sort of like no cost policing.  It got rid of the problem, but at the same time created an entirely new one with crazy ass expensive tickets given to people just dropping in to visit for 15 minutes or whatever.  anyways, their services were axed at the last meeting being they were so ticket happy that most residents felt they or their guests had been screwed over by them.  Anyways, at the condo corp meeting the official word was not paying the tickets was risking credit problems.  Outside of the meeting, at least 3 people said they had gotten tickets they refused to pay and it never showed up on their credit history.  now, keep in mind you never know when/if they sell their receivables and what will come of that in the future.  Personally, if i got a ticket from them I would not pay it.  At the same time, would not be surprised to have fly by night collection agency contact me in a couple years who i would also not pay."

Often times it will say its for a higher amount, but if paid within X days, its like $30. This is a classic psych trick to manipulate people into paying before they have a chance to think about it. Don't pay it."
mississauga,2x0z4h,bobbypbobbyp,1 point,Wed Feb 25 04:49:57 2015 UTC,"Someone once told me that that private parking tickets cannot be sent to collections. The only company that can send tickets to collections is, IMPark. Now I don't know how true it is. What I can tell you is that I got a ticket once behind &Co. And never paid it, it's been about three years. Has not affect my credit score and no one has ever called my house regarding it"
mississauga,2x0z4h,avecclasse,1 point,Sun Mar 8 07:18:45 2015 UTC,"I received a ticket from them On May 1st 2015 and I fought it. I was at 106 Humber College blvd in Etobicoke, I went to the beauty supply warehouse to pick up some things. The store opened at 9:30 and I was there exactly at 9:30 and I was out of the store by 9:40 I come out and there is a pink ticket front he Parking Control Unit on my windshield time stamped at 9:37 with the description""Failure to remain on the property"" when I was in the store at that time. I kept my receipts wrote a strongly worded letter with photocopies of the receipts. I noted that they targeted my car because I have Alberta Plates and they just wanted money out of me and they think I'm from out of province so I'll pay. They wrote back stating they saw ""two men"" get out of my car walking towards the intersection of Humber College Blvd and Westmore, so ""you must pay"". I wrote back and told them I'm a female and the sole owner of this car. I then went to the store and got video surveillance and still shots that were time stamped and I made it clear to them that I had them also made note that the Officer LIED and that I plan on taking legal action for lying on a report I now have in writing from them and wasting my time and resources. They wrote back with some excuse saying ""we have photographs of a black purse and a gift bag which are inconsistent with 2 men being in the car ""do not pay"" -- which isn't true either there was nothing of that sort in my car. They are thieves and scammers and they know it. They didn't expect me to go out of my way and security footage that was time stamped. I've contacted the BBB as well as sent emails to 311 the city of Toronto and the city of Brampton both stating the only company allowed to issue parking tickets in Toronto is Impark. These people are out of control and need to be stopped. It's annoying and I know I'm not the only one. The more media attention especially catching them in their lies, the better!."
mississauga,2x0z4h,guleedy,1 point,Thu May 21 20:06:56 2015 UTC,"sigh just got hit by one last week in Brampton. it was my first ticket ever and i panicked and my mother told me i have to pay it. the only thing off was the method i could not pay it normally i had to do it online or by phone or through mail. so i decided online, but the thing that tipped me off was the website. it was soo nonprofessional i had no means of dis-earning who or what organization it is. in frustration i payed them 30 bucks i also warned my bank of the transaction so if anything more is taken they are aware. not only until after the site i realized i screwed up and now lost 35 fcking dollars to a scam."

I really like that they've connected Webb to Karia and Absolute to City Centre, gives a lot of additional options for getting around (Plus the two additional bridges over the 403). I can't help but notice though that the entire north parking lot at square one, transit terminal, Playdium, Chapters and Ciniplex have all been turned into future development. I agree the space can be used better and that the time for a full size go kart course downtown has probably run out. But it seems pretty agressive, also considering how little room they've left for parks.  Edit: Spelling"

mississauga,2wsijz,ericchen,1 point,Tue Feb 24 02:16:31 2015 UTC,"There's a section in the Downtown21 Master Plan that explains it. Check out section 3.2 (page 18). If I'm understanding it correctly they're planning on adding a ""distribution road"" to the north side of 403 that connect Hurontario to Mavis and allows multiple points of entry into one big interchange. I think the plan is to cut down on all the merging between Cawthra and Hurontario and allow traffic to flow over the 403 without so many sets of lights. Seems like a decent plan in theory, but hard to picture how it would really work."
mississauga,2wsijz,karlos349,2,Fri Feb 27 02:30:23 2015 UTC,"Some times ago, an urban affairs professor from the U of T said there is just no way of weaning the North American from his car.  This plan proves it.  Downtown21 was a great opportunity for creating real spaces for pedestrians, but nobody seemed to be interested.  I've just come back from working several years in Europe, specifically Zurich (Switzerland) and Warsaw (Poland).  Both cities have excluded cars from their downtown cores.  I wish we had the same!"

The intersection at Eglinton and Renforth can be a bit slow in the mornings, but there really isn't a good alternate. I take it every morning and it's usually not bad. When you take the weird loop thing off of Matheson the right lane continues into the turn onto Renforth, so you can usually blow by all the people stuck on Eglinton."

mississauga,2wfznu,JoanOfArctic,8,Fri Feb 20 06:59:02 2015 UTC,"What annoys me almost as much is leaving construction signs displayed for years on end, inuring me to their promises of traffic, so that when there IS construction related traffic, I incorrectly assumed upstream that the signs meant nothing because the signs are always on display.  Or, the tale of Erin Mills, the Pkwy that cried wolf."
mississauga,2wfznu,RAND0M-HER0,2,Thu Feb 19 18:08:15 2015 UTC,You talking about how Erin Mills Parkway at Erin Centre Blvd went BAM! ONE LANE ONLY! by some black magic with literally zero warning and no effing way to get out of there?
mississauga,2wfznu,JoanOfArctic,2,Fri Feb 20 09:35:49 2015 UTC,"If you're talking about last Thursday, yes, except there were signs warning about extreme delays (!) and to take an alternate route (!!) (note: sign was kind of late for alternate route) The problem is, I ignored the signs because that road constantly has dire warnings posted on it for things not currently happening. For example, heading home yesterday the same ""extreme delays"" sign was lit up like a Christmas tree and all three lanes were moving great."

I don't recall there being an EXPECT DELAYS sign for a good week and a bit after they knocked Erin Mills Pkwy down, and then once the sign went up two lanes opened up, and sometimes three. Well now it's three, but where the eff was it two week ago!?   But they've been working on that water plant for years so there's always been construction signs in the area, so of course no one expected it to be any different. It would also be nice if the sign was before the last set of lights I believe at Thomas(?) before you're stuck in a long stretch with the inability to turn around unless you have a Wrangler"

mississauga,2wdut9,Vorter_Jackson,2,Thu Feb 19 02:13:21 2015 UTC,"There has got to be much more to this story than what we have been told.  What lawyer would risk virtually everything they have worked so hard for their entire adult lives to smuggle dope in for a client, knowing full well that it would be searched?  ""She was arrested after police found drugs — reportedly marijuana — concealed inside items of clothing she had brought for a client.""  I think it is more likely that the client tried to pull a fast one and had someone ""cleverly"" sew hidden packets into the garments.  Perhaps in shoulder pads or other areas that would not make it too obvious.  The clothing items may have been delivered to her in a bag or suitcase and she did not thoroughly inspect them herself prior to delivering them to her sneaky client.  I could be wrong but this is one possible scenario."

Although a couple of the restaurants on the list I've been to many times and thought were great, there isn't anything offered i'd bite on making a reservation based on pricing.  Let alone one's I haven't tried.  You have to start somewhere... so hopefully they get some traction where it 'becomes a thing'.  btw - didn't look at lunch pricing.  This used to be the best deals in licious offers.  The website is probably by design not easy to navigate offers so as to not put their clients in a price war with each other.  fair enough, but frustrating looking for a gem of a deal."

mississauga,2w72h4,Qtips_,2,Tue Feb 17 18:59:40 2015 UTC,27K -35K depending on experience.
mississauga,2w72h4,Qtips_,2,Wed Feb 18 13:54:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I just have a quick question, not to sound rude or anything because thats not what im here for. Im bilingual myself based in the GTA (french being my first language, and extremely fluent in english as well). I know that finding a quality bilingual person is extremely hard. How are you suppose to hire someone on such low starting salary, considering he is bilingual?"
mississauga,2w72h4,JoanOfArctic,4,Wed Feb 18 14:15:04 2015 UTC,"I've often asked myself the same question when employers come up to me and ask for bilingual, because you're essentially asking for a walking translator. I don't know what the thought process is but i'm assuming that they just treat it as a regular position with the addition of being bilingual if that makes sense. What would have been a 25k salary was bumped by a few cents to 27k. It's up to the business unfortunately."
mississauga,2w72h4,Qtips_,1 point,Wed Feb 18 14:31:42 2015 UTC,"I'm also bilingual and based in the GTA, and frankly, none of the positions I've ever been contacted for by recruiters where bilingualism is a requirement have ever been worth my time.  When you think about it, any position that requires you to be bilingual will have you dealing with outside customers who lack dedicated account managers, because if they had dedicated account managers, you would choose a candidate who is strongest in that customer base's language and be done with it, no ""fully bilingual"" (ie, native proficiency in both) required.  So all these jobs are basically low value customer service roles where the company is either too small and/or too cheap to hire two people.  Never the kind of thing I feel like doing as long as I have any other option.  As it is, I don't think it's a useless skill by any means, and I think a lot of my employers over the years have benefited from my bilingualism.  However, it always rubbed me the wrong way that employers seem to think that a skill that I've essentially studied for pretty much my entire lifetime should command just a 10% premium over the same job done by a unilingual person."

If you truly want Irish Breakfast Tea, which is typically made for the US market (and isn't really sold in Ireland), then a lot of the larger mid-market grocery stores would have it. (So, Loblaws would probably have it but No Frills wouldn't)  Twinings (an English brand) makes it, for example.  However, if you were hoping to get tea that Irish people (as in, people in Ireland) drink, then you'll be looking for one of the following brands.  They call it ""tea"" by the way, and the fact that there is more than one kind of tea is a fact that has only recently begun to penetrate into the island, and most culchies would be afraid to admit that they know that since it makes them sound like they've spent too much time in Dublin:   Barry's (my personal favourite, and I'd recommend the Barry's Gold, but the green box of Barry's is fine if that's all you can find) Lyon's (normal Lyon's is pretty meh imo, but their Gold blend reserve is quite nice and if you find it I'd recommend it also, although it's much harder to find) Bewley's (if you're a bit of a poncey twat)   There are a number of British food suppliers that also have a small selection of Irish goods, the cheapest one is British Grocery Wholesale at Argentia and Winston Churchill - http://britishgrocerwholesale.com/.  I was there yesterday and they had Bewley's and they might have had some Barry's Green teabags but I forget.  A Bit of Home (925 Rathburn Road East, at Tomken, closed on Mondays) is your best bet if you want to get Barry's or Lyon's since they actually carry Irish goods in addition to those available in Britain.  http://www.abitofhome.ca/  Source: lived in Ireland.  drank a lot of tea (because you make people nervous if you don't)  (edit: formatting)"

mississauga,2vthhw,arl232,3,Fri Feb 13 23:50:44 2015 UTC,I tried calling a couple years back for a dog locked out on a balcony for hours on a hot day. Got sent in circles between OSPCA and Animal Services. Hopefully with the new Animal Care By-law Animal Services will respond to these types of calls.  According to the by-law:    Pets cannot be left outdoors during extreme weather except for brief walks or exercise unless the animal has access to adequate shelter to protect the animal – in effect immediately.

mississauga,2vthhw,Boogilywoo2,5,Sat Feb 14 01:23:23 2015 UTC,What ended up happening?
mississauga,2vthhw,RecklessRancor,2,Sat Feb 14 13:53:12 2015 UTC,"There is something you should do before calling someone. Go over and knock on that Neighbor's door, and tell them that the dog is whimpering. Also that it would be advisable that they bring the dog in as it is cold this time of year.   If they don't listen, then I would advise calling animal services. Especially if there is a cold weather alert out. Much like humans, animals can die out in the cold."
mississauga,2vthhw,Boogilywoo2,4,Tue Feb 17 03:16:04 2015 UTC,Normally I'd say 311 or animal services. If it's only been 20 minutes and the dogs are large huskies that still applies.  If they're smaller breeds and it's been an extended period I would suggest the police. Given this weeks brutal cold snap the possibility of the animal dying is very real.

Because of this, they got screwed over and evicted since they didn't pay the next month in advance.  Pretty sad story. If I ever find out who that person is I'm gonna smack em."
mississauga,2vsamv,IN547148L3,1 point,Wed Feb 18 20:10:15 2015 UTC,"I do and it really wasn't the best in Mississauga. There was a small sushi restaurant that was operated by a fellow named Chris in the basement of the International Food court at the corner of Hurontario and Dundas that was literally the best ever sushi. This guy use to work at multiple 5 star restaurants in Asia and came to open his own business in Canada. Unfortunately, his need to provide the best fish at an affordable price was his downfall (imo). As a person who comes from Taiwan and visits Japan on a regular basis, that guy literally had the best sushi in Mississauga.  Right now, I go to Park Sushi (or Sushi Park?) on Dundas for a la carte Sushi or Heart Sushi for AYCE. Those are the best in Mississauga atm and I highly suggest trying them out."

Did you recently call either company (Or Teksavvy/Distributel/etc) because you had issues with your TV/Internet/Phone? In general, Bell uses dark green tall boxes and Rogers short light green boxes.  If they need to replace the underground cable they will hang a temporary wire until spring/summer when they can come back and properly bury it.

mississauga,2vkarf,cyprusette,9,Wed Feb 11 18:52:44 2015 UTC,"If they're into ice-skating/if you can provide them with skates, Celebration Square should still be open. Tobogganing? Skiing at Glen Eden or Centennial? Depending on the weather, you may be able to go for a nice walk by the water in PC at Jack Darling Park.  SkyZone is a sweet time, although you're pregnant and I don't know the rules with bouncing around getting balls thrown at you.  Playdium is really fun for all ages.   Food-wise you could take them for a legit burger i.e. Burger's Priest in PC, Apache Burger near Kipling Station in Etobicoke, C and Dubb's on Dundas in Mississauga. You could take them for sushi or Pho if they're into Asian foods.   Other than that, I can't think of much other than going downtown and just absorbing the hustle of Toronto on Queen Street or at the Eaton Centre. The ROM and AGO are also really cool places and from what I can remember decently priced, and with the GO system a downtown trip is stress-free."

Ive never been to skyzone, I would be perfectly fine going with them though and not participating since Im pregnant, we have a 2 1/2 year old toddler, so she could be part of the fun there, which is good enough for me :)  These are great suggestions, thank you!"
mississauga,2vkarf,kaysea112,2,Wed Feb 11 20:20:53 2015 UTC,"There you go make a day out in downtown Toronto. Do your own walking tour. You can hit city hall/Eaton center, young and dundas, St. Lawrence Market for food, Kensington Market/Spadina Ave. and maybe Smokies for poutine (Good for price and really great variety of poutine). There you've done a loop and maybe the ROM if you're still interested.  You may even walk it using The Path an underground walkway, it's pretty interesting and not many people now how interconnected it is.  CN Tower is 31-39 dollars?, for maybe an hour or two, not worth it.  :EDIT: just saw you're fully pregnant, maybe not so good because of the walking."

Theatre Companies: Theatre Unlimited (I'm most familiar with TU as I participated in a few productions and had a great time and met tons of people), Clarkson Music Theatre, Etobicoke Musical Productions, City Centre Musical Productions, Meadowvale Music Theatre, Class Productions Theatre Society  Theatres: Living Arts Centre, Meadowvale Theatre  The place I'm thinking of I couldn't find with Google, it's around P.A.T and the Korean restaurants around Dundas and Dixie.  But there is Club Oasis Karaoke at Erindale Station Rd and Central Pkwy W.  Nice Bars and clubs? Bars: Ten at Hurontario and Lakeshore, in Port Credit, Roc n' docs and Crooked Cue also in Port Credit have music sometimes.

Rattray marsh is cool too, but it's really short - though you can walk from port credit through Jack Darling and then through Rattray marsh and then it's a respectable distance.  And if you have access to a car, you're no more than 30 minutes away from a ton of fantastic hiking spots!  The running room runs running clinics/groups and it's a great way to meet people and build up your fitness (they even have a walking group if that's where you're at)  There's some guy on here always telling people about a board game night he's involved in, if that's more your speed.

Title/post suggests that the former mentioned qualities may or may not be in question.  in any case, it depends what you like to do. You like winter sports? grab a coach bus from kipling to blue mountains and back. There's butt-tons of rinks you can go skating. Summer time mississauga has a pretty live longboarding scene, provided you can stay away from the groms, and the numerous trails are a cyclists heaven, be it for road or dirt.  Try checking out Streetsville and Port Credit, there's lots of cafes and bars in both those areas.   If you like tabletop games go and check out Teddy and Me in South Common mall. they host magic tournaments and other stuffs.  People in mississauga are generally nice, but don't tolerate snooty stuck up people very much.

He's already just complaining that there's nothing to do, we tell him there's things to do and the depressing guy just shoots down each thing we tell him, and doesn't thank anyone if he got any tips from them.   Edit: A prime saugan according to the downvote brigade huh."
mississauga,2vggua,TheDarkLight,6,Wed Feb 11 00:11:41 2015 UTC,Prejudice? I can't tell if you're massively overreacting or you just don't know what it means.
mississauga,2vggua,caretotry_theseagain,0,Wed Feb 11 00:15:28 2015 UTC,"Very well aware of what it means, ty! The way OP phrased his question was obviously influenced by his low expectations (""what the heck is there to do"") of prospect for entertainment. He then proceeds to receive answers that bitch about and shit on every idea people give.  You know what, you're right. He's a charming fellow, and clearly so are all the others here!"
mississauga,2vggua,TheDarkLight,0,Wed Feb 11 01:21:59 2015 UTC,"This is what prejudice means: ""an unfavorable opinion or feeling formed beforehand or without knowledge, thought, or reason.""  So he has an unfavourable opinion of Mississauga. But, he lives in Mississauga and has clearly been looking for things to do so he has knowledge and is actively attaining more. Thought and reason are debatable but most people never use that anyways. In any case, it's not just him. The vast majority of people on this sub, and people of my age group that I know in Mississauga absolutely agree with the OP. What the heck is there to do in Mississauga? I've lived here since I was 6. I have exhausted every corner of this city and for someone between the ages of 19-30, there are very few draws to living in the city. It's expensive, it's expansive, and worst of all, it's filled with families. So most 'entertainment' sector businesses cater to them. That's not a knock on Mississauga necessarily (historically though, the most prosperous cities are built by young people with jobs... Mississauga is losing both the young people and the jobs) because that's the city they want to build but it's a shitty situation for us.  In addition, he's clearly fed up with spending another weekend either at a trashy club like My Apartment or a dead bar like Coopers or just at home mulling a move to Toronto. I don't blame the phrasing of the question or his low expectations, it comes from his experiences. You can't just dismiss that as thoughtless drivel because you disagree. You may find Mississauga fun but if he doesn't like the activities you do he's a biased jerk? It is legitimately frustrating, especially with how long a trek to Toronto can take, made all the more unattractive by our current weather situation. Furthermore, he hasn't shit on or bitch about anything. Please take the time to read before you make such claims.  That being said, for people that share your interests, maybe Mississauga is a fun place to be. Overall though, in my opinion, those people are in the minority. However, I would like to point out that maybe you need to take a second to examine your own biases? You seem offended by a harmless question and his preferences. Why is it bad that he chooses to engage in some activities and not others? Why is it such a problem if someone criticizes Mississauga (legitimately or without basis)?  Ultimately, while downvotes don't mean much, generally speaking you said something people found to be extremely disagreeable. Whether you would like to admit it or not, what you said was a huge overreaction."

OP has still shat on every suggestion made and people appear to enjoy complaining.  OP didn't even express interests.   Who goes to coopers, or ""my appartment"" any more lol.. the former especially, that's real greasy."
mississauga,2vggua,TheDarkLight,0,Fri Feb 13 01:06:21 2015 UTC,"Dude just let it go. I don't agree with you that his post or question was 'slimy' in any way. You admit you overreacted but are still trying to justify it? You overreacted for some bizarre reason that no one can understand except for you. You don't seem to agree that Mississauga lacks entertainment options for young adults. You don't seem to agree that there is a legitimate reason why said young adults could be frustrated.  OP has not shit on anything my friend. He has made one comment in this entire thread: ""Did this happen?! Would love to meet some new people."" Again, I urge you to read and write carefully. He didn't express interests because there are so few things to do that limiting yourself to your interests eliminates most of what little there is to do. He implied he's willing to try different things as long as he can meet cool people.  This is a futile exercise. I keep telling you the reason we are all so frustrated is because there is nothing to do here. What alternatives will people come up with? Taking a shuttle to a ski hill hours outside of the city like you suggested? That's not even in Mississauga. FYI, you're literally proving my point by calling coopers or my apartment terrible. They are apparently some of Mississauga's top spots for the bar and club scene respectively. Z 103.5 is at My Apartment every Saturday because it's Mississauga's premiere Sat. night spot. Coopers is famous city wide for their wing night. A city as big as Mississauga should have a bevy of different types of joints to choose from, especially in the core. Even Oakville has a better night life. What clubs or bars do you recommend? I've been to most in Streetsville and Port Credit and I can tell you first hand that they are either dead, trashy, or just plain boring. Bottom line being Mississauga isn't a city for young people, and so I, along with most of the city's youth, will be moving to Toronto as soon as the opportunity presents itself."

Also,  it may be difficult for many to pin point exactly how many hours a week are spent on the phone.  Perhaps it would be more helpful to put that first  page of questions on a ranking scale as well,  or give some averages for people to choose from (I.e less than 7 hours,  8-15, 16-25,  25+). Getting an average might give a better indication. Or perhaps a question regarding cell phone usage on week days vs weekend days,  morning vs evening etc may prove to be insightful as well.

I don't have a source (Other than word of mouth from a former Rogers tech), but apparently all 500+ digital channels Rogers offers take the equivalent bandwidth of 2 analog channels to broadcast.

If no major retailer comes calling then look for Square One to break it up into two or more smaller locations (similar to Sears being divided into Maison Simon and Sport Check)."

I got sick of them pushing that retinal picture on me even though my insurance doesn't cover it and the Mayo institute says it's not really worth having - just another revenue stream for the optometrist.  It turns out that I have retinal thinning as a result of high myopia - none of the ""fancy"" doctors figured that out."
mississauga,2tvn0e,JoanOfArctic,1 point,Tue Jan 27 22:16:43 2015 UTC,I too have retinal thinning. There's of course the tiny chance of detachment which is serious so I do go to one of the fancy optometrists with the Optus imaging device.  The problem though is that the new doctor with an older version of the device can not see any thinning but my old doctor with the newer version of the device can see it.  Manually checking the eye doesn't show much. It's stupid.
mississauga,2tvn0e,SHUT_DOWN_EVERYTHING,0,Wed Jan 28 02:31:11 2015 UTC,If you have retinal thinning then taking retinal/fundus photos is very much worth it. Retinal thinning can lead to retinal detachments. Being cheap over a few dollars is NOT worth losing vision over. You only have the eyes you are born with.

mississauga,2tqlik,mhender,5,Mon Jan 26 18:12:11 2015 UTC,"A lot of the things that people find problematic about Mississauga are just a product of the type of ""city"" it is.  What I mean by that, of course, is that it's not really much of a city - people sleep here, but they don't really LIVE here.  They go elsewhere to work, and in most cases to entertain themselves.  People move here to buy a house with a bit of grass and start a family.  They are so busy paying for that house, chauffeuring their children and mowing their grass that they don't really get to know their neighbors, and that's ok with just about everyone here because everyone else is in the same boat.  I'm not sure there is a solution to these issues - because it's kind of like trying to give people coca cola that doesn't fizz up their nose.  Coca Cola is fizzy - it just is.  If you don't want it to fizz up your nose, you don't want Coca Cola, order juice. So it may not surprise you that I've decided I'm just not meant to live in the suburbs.  I mean, I'm here for now and I'll make the best of it.  The roads are smooth and it's easy to buy things.  The garbage truck seems to pick up just about anything my neighbours put out there no matter if it's the ""no limit"" week or not.  There are some nice dog parks and I'm not far from either the Halton Conservation areas or Toronto.  It's not terrible.  But what I don't like about it is better solved by me moving somewhere that didn't have those problems in the first place."

mississauga,2tmlc9,fucktard1215,13,Sun Jan 25 17:12:55 2015 UTC,"I live on fifth line so I'm at the mall pretty often. It's seriously dead and it would need a lot to be revived. Metro and Shoppers are the only stores I see that have a frequent stream of customers. I don't know much about economics, seeing as I'm only 14, but I think the mall needs better stores if it wants to stay alive. The Sheridan Centre is flanked to the north and south side by two high schools, Erindale, and my high school Iona. Because of this, the population of teenagers in the area is pretty large, therefore adding a few stores people my age like would make the mall an attractive after school place to go. This is especially true, considering the schools are both off of Erin Mills, the same street as the mall. Another demographic that the mall fails to cater is the rich people. Mississauga road runs almost directly behind the Sheridan Centre. Who lives on Mississauga road mostly? People with money. Therefore if more expensive stores were to be added, it could appeal to those living on Doulton Drive, seeing as they could get all the designer shit they want, without having to go up the 403 all the way to Square One. I know I'm probably wrong, but I've just always thought that the mall has potential if it had better stores..."

mississauga,2tmlc9,barton-street,2,Mon Jan 26 15:28:54 2015 UTC,"I have lived around, and visited friends in the area of Sheridan mall for 25 years.  In the good old days, it had a movie theatre, LCBO, arcades, kids play area, a good food court.  When Eatons died, so did the heart of the mall.  It has gone through many reincarnations, Dominion did a couple of large rebuilds (now Metro).  The RSA office moved in to take over Eaton's old spot, which would be stable occupancy.  The library was saved!  Target was supposed to be the next big anchor, so much for that.  The mall has had an identity crisis for a long time, with the disparate demographics surrounding it.  Roche Court, the co-ops at 5th line, and Clarkson area feed in lower income families.  Then you have the Sherwood Forest (Mississauga Rd), Lorne Park communities pushing higher earning families into the mix.  The truth is, for those with a car, the competition is high.  Want nicer shops?  Go to Port Credit, Sherwood Forest Village, or any other mall that is within a 15 minute drive.  So who is left, those with lower incomes and people on foot.  For those families, I think the mall has served them relatively well.  Although the Metro has expensive groceries, there has always been a discount department store, shoe repair, jewellery, music stores, bank, clothing stores, library, community centre...etc.  There was fairly good variety, just not choice within those types of stores.  I think it will operate as is for a while, but it needs another anchor store.  With Target leaving, i am not sure who will fill that role."

It will shut its South Common location (which is small).  However, Erin Mills TC is quite a bit farther north for people who live closer to the Ford plant, so they'll move into Sheridan Centre as well.  In which case, what we should be asking is, what is going to go into South Common?"
mississauga,2tmlc9,kaysea112,13,Sun Jan 25 17:20:53 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if Walmart would want to move from South Common because of the bus terminal there.

It used to have an Eatons, and a movie theatre, and a bowling alley. It was one of the first malls built in the GTA, and is almost 40 years old.   The problem is the density forecast for SW end of Mississauga never really happened. Erin Mills Town centre was built further north, and Sherway Gardens is about 10 mins away by car.   Target was the big chance for that mall to be reinvigorated, now that it has failed... I anticipate a major redevelopment of the space in the next 10 years. The place bleeds money, its kept clean and hasn't fallen into disrepair but the business opportunity is wasted. The satellite stores on the fringes of the parking lot make the money.   If they bulldoze it and re-grade the land they could turn it into an office park with a outdoor mall facing Erin Mills Parkway. Probably a much better use of space."

mississauga,2tmlc9,kukasdesigns,1 point,Mon Jan 26 05:43:39 2015 UTC,You are ignoring the density of Roche court which sits right beside it. The number of people in Roche would easily outnumber many of the areas you have listed.
mississauga,2tmlc9,nonpromqueen,1 point,Mon Jan 26 13:53:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. I think the density is important, because it's a highly populated, low income area, which may scare off potential retailers. Aside from that, I don't think density/population of Roche Court factors in at all.  The overall population of Lorne Park, Erindale/Mississauga road, and other upper-middle to upper class areas is still greater than Roche Court. Definitely more disposable income there as well. That's not including Oakville, and many of the other middle to upper class areas surrounding the mall. Homelands, Erindale, Port Credit, Streetsville, Mineola...  Mississauga in general is an upper-middle class haven; tons of disposable income around. It's surprising that a mall could struggle as much as Sheridan does. Even South Common, which SUCKS, is usually quite full."

mississauga,2srr9l,peesu,9,Sat Jan 17 21:47:15 2015 UTC,"Personally, I love it. Smooth ride. No traffic. No turns. Just stops at the stations, like on a subway. If Mississauga can't or won't have subways, transitways aren't the worst alternative. I say build more.  That said, the problem is with the stations themselves. As I've said before here, the stations are unnecessarily hard to get to from other buses. They could easily have designed the stations so that other buses passing by them could have swung by them on their routes. Instead you have to get off the other bus, walk and possibly cross at an intersection, and then get to the station.  That's just missing the point of a station. It's supposed to connect people and buses, not people and station."
mississauga,2srr9l,yawaramin,2,Sat Jan 17 23:29:10 2015 UTC,"I haven't used it yet but I think it's a step in the right direction. The bus thing will definitely change when it comes into full swing. I have a few thoughts on the transit system in Mississauga.   The reason there is no subway in Mississauga is because a huge urban investment like a subway system demands a certain population density in order to be justified. Other than along Hurontario, the population simply isn't dense enough to have a conventional subway system. The transit way on the other hand is in a peculiar situation as the neighbourhoods between the 403 & 407 are quite dense and to the south of it density varies (highest concentration of people around square1  The purpose of the transitway is to serve the population north of square1 (as Mississauga south is fairly well served by GO transit) and to provide public transit to the airport. There are already several buses going to the airport and they all take 1hour+ from my house The transit way is along eastgate, most of which is pretty bare... meaning people will have to transfer at least once no matter where they are going. They need to eventually connect it to the GO lines and the subway line for people going into Toronto... as of right now I can't imagine many people who are commuters to Toronto find much value in the transitway   LINKS:   Transit way Map  Population Density Map"
mississauga,2srr9l,thebigstinky,1 point,Sun Jan 18 01:45:28 2015 UTC,I have a feeling that they'll realize this and alter the system/routes to connect everything together
mississauga,2srr9l,RAND0M-HER0,4,Sat Jan 17 23:55:32 2015 UTC,Not finished yet but it cut my commute to SQ1 to 9-10 mins from 15-25. Traffic on Eastgate and Rathburn is a killer.  I think it'll improve as more stations open and they integrate connections with other routes.
mississauga,2srr9l,barton-street,3,Sun Jan 18 14:07:55 2015 UTC,I'd say it's already significantly improved my commute. Can't wait until the entire thing's actually up and running.
mississauga,2srr9l,Avagis,1 point,Mon Jan 19 17:54:23 2015 UTC,"It's significantly improved my commute and I'm starting to see the stations get used more every week. I even saw someone get on at Cawthra last week! But seriously. they could have easily done without that station. I get they wanted more stations with parking, but Dixie really isn't far if you're driving anyway. Maybe once GO starts using it too it will be a good replacement for parking at SQ1, for those going to York. But I read that GO doesn't even plan on using Cawthra and will only stop at Dixie and Renforth.  All that aside, I think it's a good first step. The partial opening makes it a little awkward. But having the stations finished and sitting empty would have been even worse (I mostly feel bad for that security guard who has to ""patrol"" the stations all day). Hopefully things will fall into place once it's fully operational."

Too many US stores do this, like K-Mart.  The US stores are struggling, so they pull out of Canada, even though those stores were in the black."
mississauga,2sk50b,DeadbyChapter2,6,Fri Jan 16 01:15:21 2015 UTC,"The US stores are struggling, so they pull out of Canada, even though those stores were in the black.   they closed because they were not forecasting profitability in Canada until 2024 or something."
mississauga,2sk50b,mhender,7,Fri Jan 16 02:58:23 2015 UTC,"They said 2021, which is only 6 years.  Usually stores don't plan on recuperating their sunk costs for 5-7 years, so this is really all to plan.  They're just spinning it to sound better."
mississauga,2sk50b,DeadbyChapter2,3,Fri Jan 16 03:29:34 2015 UTC,They were losing 3.1 million per DAY.
mississauga,2sk50b,matterhorn1,7,Fri Jan 16 20:48:16 2015 UTC,What did they expect opening 100+ stores in 2 years.
mississauga,2sk50b,acetylcysteine,2,Fri Jan 16 03:19:52 2015 UTC,"this is the main problem, dumb to expand so fast."
mississauga,2sk50b,matterhorn1,2,Fri Jan 16 20:48:39 2015 UTC,"I think that was a reference to K-Mart leaving Canada. Blockbuster would be another example, their Canadian stores were doing better than their American ones."
mississauga,2sk50b,kitten_anus,4,Fri Jan 16 03:10:55 2015 UTC,"August 28 for the EMTC location but the Sheridan Centre location opened in October. Regardless its still crazy that it all happened so quickly but like I've been saying and someone else said here too, that's what happens when you open so many stores in so little time. Unfortunate as I like Target (biased as I work there)"
mississauga,2sk50b,Jsimms52,1 point,Fri Jan 16 18:33:11 2015 UTC,"It opened last summer, I was there opening day.  I just knew they would not last long.  No where near the product selection that Walmart has, especially the grocery section.  No plant & garden department, not as many good things on sale, etc."
mississauga,2sk50b,bacolavia,14,Mon Jan 19 18:30:01 2015 UTC,"that, and the possible impending doom of sears suggests even more retail space will open up.   Sheridan Mall ended up using the old Eaton's they had as offices, I wonder if these extra spaces will be considered for other uses like so (ie. Offices, Public Library, Athletic Gym, etc.)"
mississauga,2sk50b,hellodan15,10,Thu Jan 15 21:57:12 2015 UTC,This is going to be kind of tough for Sheridan Centre. Never good for a mall when your main anchor is a grocery store.  In the States you see some low-occupancy malls turn over space to be used for churches or community colleges. Sometimes you even see like a model railroad club rent out a storefront and use it to store their track layout.
mississauga,2sk50b,kitten_anus,14,Thu Jan 15 22:30:47 2015 UTC,"Sheridan Centre has been pretty dead for as long as I can remember :(  Honestly, if Sheridan Centre turned itself into a artisan workshop of sorts (like your model railroad club idea... but lets say, cabinetmakers, makerspaces, art studios, etc), that may be somewhat interesting..."
mississauga,2sk50b,hellodan15,7,Fri Jan 16 01:16:37 2015 UTC,"I think Sheridan Centre was killed by the opening of Erin Mills Town Centre. Mississauga probably has room for two large successful shopping malls. Square One dominates overall, and Sherway Gardens is big on the east side, but there was an opening for a second-tier mall on the west side. If Sheridan played their cards right it could have been them, but EMTC basically gutted them, along with South Common and Meadowvale TC."
mississauga,2sk50b,kitten_anus,7,Fri Jan 16 01:23:17 2015 UTC,"good point. I don't think Mississauga has the density to support so many large malls. Heck, family friends who run very successful restaurant chains in the GTA, and the proceeded to come to Mississauga all shuttered in 2-3 years. Retail just isn't good here it seems."
mississauga,2sk50b,hellodan15,4,Fri Jan 16 01:26:18 2015 UTC,"If Mississauga can support 2, Brampton has a mall capacity of like 1.5 decent malls, Oakville and Burlington 1 mall each. Same with the entire Niagara region."
mississauga,2sk50b,testtoob,2,Fri Jan 16 05:11:00 2015 UTC,"Eh, Niagara has tourists that skew the ""capacity"" for retail opportunities (ie. look at that fancy new outlet mall).  Mississauga and Brampton are within decent driving distance to mega-malls in the GTA, draining some retail capacity for these areas. Folks often go to Yorkdale, Vaughan Mills, and Eatons Centre to do their shopping.  Often, cities also have shopping districts (ie. Heartland in Mississauga), that further disseminate the ""retail demand"".  Kingston has one mall that is sort of on the same level of Erin Mills T.C. kinda sucks :("
mississauga,2sk50b,hellodan15,2,Fri Jan 16 14:33:39 2015 UTC,Probably time soon for someone to create a page for Sheridan Centre on Deadmalls.com.
mississauga,2sk50b,testtoob,2,Fri Jan 16 04:03:48 2015 UTC,It does have the blue notes outlet store with nothing over $10. My entire wardrobe is made up of stuff from it. That place is the bomb.

mississauga,2sk50b,alcabazar,2,Thu Jan 15 23:51:35 2015 UTC,"I think most big Goodlife locations are in the 45,000 to 60,000 square foot range, while these empty Targets will probably almost all be over 100,000 square feet, so they'd probably want to split the space up. Would be kind of cool if they would build an enormous gym somewhere, but I think their strategy is more about having enough locations that people don't have to travel far to get to one."
mississauga,2sk50b,kitten_anus,2,Fri Jan 16 02:42:46 2015 UTC,They're trying to make Erin Mills mall an upscale mall. I doubt they'll be adding a gym or anything like that.

mississauga,2sk50b,alcabazar,2,Fri Jan 16 20:52:00 2015 UTC,"Well I mean... Square One already has a Goodlife next to the Bay, there it would be more of an expansion."

mississauga,2sk50b,iksworbeZ,2,Fri Jan 16 01:18:42 2015 UTC,I'd like to see the Walmart from burnhamthorpe move into that space
mississauga,2sk50b,hellodan15,2,Fri Jan 16 00:34:40 2015 UTC,I second that.
mississauga,2sk50b,c74,1 point,Fri Jan 16 01:18:57 2015 UTC,"Sheridan opting for RSA to use the space as offices was sort of bandaid solution to a cost problem.  They had unusable retail space and decided that the 'strip mall' strategy would help keep the current businesses while trying to sort out a long term solution.  The problem being, the costs of an indoor strip mall far exceed the costs of maintaining an outdoor one.  Sort of interesting they expanded the use of the property in the outdoor strip mall fashion.  I worked many years around this space... I think it might be interesting to develop these spaces along the lines of pacific mall / flea market type vendors.  Very small shops, unique products/services... share the overhead and negotiate the deal with the promise of foot traffic.    I do not know about the contracts in place, but suspect a lot of contractors/vendors are being fucked over huge by this.  I mean, they renovated the stores to the foundations in many cases I am familiar about..  and now they are seeking protection from creditors/vendors.  The fire sale for real dollars through the bankruptcy/creditor protection  process will make some interesting opportunities for people with vision.  But, who knows, maybe everything will become walmarts... i mean, it's not like walmart are unsophisticated... yeah, company x fails so they'll just buy up every store and lease and put the signs up and go for it.  it don't work that way."
mississauga,2sk50b,dbcanuck,3,Fri Jan 16 06:59:12 2015 UTC,"I worked very closely with many of the small business owners in Sheridan for a couple of years, and  I can't help but be really bummed out for them.  Tenants had their businesses disrupted or displaced with the promise of Target attracting more foot-traffic.  Some stores were practically invisible with the scaffolding and construction around them.  Vacant spaces became recruiting offices for new Target employees.  I have no doubt we'll see a few more places in the mall shutter their doors within a few months.  It's tough when you can't compete for the affluent Mississauga Road customers, nor provide the same options as some of the lower-end malls. I have a sinking feeling the next big thing to land in Sheridan Centre is a wrecking ball."
mississauga,2sk50b,kittysly,2,Sat Jan 17 16:00:54 2015 UTC,"RIOCan was not stupid, as were most of the other big property owners. Their leases are owned by Target US, not Target Canada.... the leases are good for at least 8 years in most locations, so Target will need to negotiate sub-leases with new tenants.  Not sure how the bankruptcy will take place for Target Canada, but likely the suppliers will get screwed. I think employees are protected, aside from having no jobs in 4-6 months.  18,000 people work at Target. A lot of people left stable retail companies (Canadian Tire, HBC, Shoppers Drug Mart, Loblaws, etc) to work in Target head office. Bad career moves."
mississauga,2sk50b,kitten_anus,14,Fri Jan 16 14:56:12 2015 UTC,"Yes it's odd that Square One has such huge expansions coming, and yet there will be an empty Target along with an empty movie theatre."
mississauga,2sk50b,TheHozOpp1,7,Thu Jan 15 22:00:51 2015 UTC,"I believe with the movie theatre, it wasn't that it went out of business, Square One didn't renew their lease because they have other plans for that part of the mall.  I could actually them opening theatres where Target/Zellers/Eatons used to be. Maybe they could even move the Coliseum over. The Coliseum will be 18 years old this year, which is older than the Sussex Centre/Erin Mill Town Centre etc. theatres were when they closed. Silver City was built after the Coliseum and it's shut down. I assume Cineplex owns/has a long term lease on the land where the Coliseum is sitting, and that land has got to be worth a lot more than it was in 1997. Selling it to a condo developer or something would probably easily pay to build a new state-of-the-art theatre inside Square One."
mississauga,2sk50b,kitten_anus,3,Fri Jan 16 00:36:33 2015 UTC,"You may be right, but Coliseum is a prime spot for a theatre, plus I think they are making boat loads of money; and I think they benefit a lot by having their own parking lot... or lot in general. I don't think the size of that Target will be able to fit an IMAX screen and an AVX/Atmos theatre. plus additional screens."
mississauga,2sk50b,TheWorthlessProfit,2,Fri Jan 16 03:27:48 2015 UTC,"I'd tear down the Target and build a new wing out into that largely empty parking lot. Add some smaller stores, a restaurant or two, maybe some more underground parking. Build like a 20 screen theatre, designed like at Yorkdale, where most of the theatre is up on a higher level where most stores wouldn't even be viable, so having the theatres in the mall doesn't mean giving up space that you could have filled with higher paying retail tenants."
mississauga,2sk50b,kitten_anus,1 point,Fri Jan 16 03:54:42 2015 UTC,"I mean Mississauga already has a large movie theatre in cineplex Cinemas Winston Churchill, and it's got 23 screens, so I don't think they've any plans for that. Winston Churchill is actually a lot better for if you want to watch any movies that aren't super mainstream like boyhood or stuff like that."
mississauga,2sk50b,kitten_anus,2,Sat Jan 17 05:14:59 2015 UTC,"But when Silver City was right near the Winston Churchill theatre, selection was even better because they couldn't show the same movies at the same time, so you'd have 33 screen or whatever, all potentially showing different movies. In practice, new release blockbusters would be on a ton of those screens, but still it created a space for less popular movies to be shown."
mississauga,2sk50b,TheWorthlessProfit,11,Sun Jan 18 01:40:31 2015 UTC,"I think this could be a fatal blow for some smaller malls, like Westdale. I could see them just bulldozing most of the building and making it into a bunch of big box stores, like South Common."
mississauga,2sk50b,kitten_anus,8,Thu Jan 15 22:14:33 2015 UTC,"The restaurants in West Dale will probably still survive, I think enough students flood in around lunch time to maintain those, but yea all the small niche stores might die out."
mississauga,2sk50b,kaysea112,8,Thu Jan 15 22:26:38 2015 UTC,"I remember going over to Westdale a lot in high school until the point when people started getting drivers licences, then we'd go to Square One instead."

mississauga,2sk50b,matterhorn1,2,Thu Jan 15 22:17:44 2015 UTC,"There are some American malls I've seen where a big anchor has left and Best Buy takes over the space, and I am pretty sure that mall owners are giving them a break on rent just to fill the space. Anchors in general pay way less per square foot than smaller stores, because malls need anchors stores to attract people and remain viable.  I think Burlington Coat Factory takes advantage of this, because you see a lot of malls where a big anchor has left and Burlington Coat Factory takes the space."
mississauga,2sk50b,DeadbyChapter2,2,Fri Jan 16 01:11:30 2015 UTC,"There are VERY few companies who could fill that space. BB would be one of them.

You can't really put the bins on a snow pile because it'd be too heavy to lift up, and it'll probably tip over. Not sure how they feel like addressing that since folks rarely clear a flat area for their trash by the road."
mississauga,2sgzqp,c74,1 point,Wed Mar 11 01:09:15 2015 UTC,"What happens if the new bins get damaged or stolen?  Does the city pay to replace them?  I watched the video and love the fact the sorting of recyclables seems to not be an issue anymore.  Wifey will be pleased.  Sort of confused what happens if you have extra garbage one week.  Currently, you just buy a tag and stick it on a bag... wondering if that still exists or if we have to go to the dump going forward.  And what happens to the couple weeks a year where you are allowed to throw out as many bags as you want.  Seems like the whole system is designed to get garbage trucks running with one person instead of two... and coming half as many times.  Does the driver actually get out to do extra's?  And.. judging by the video the automation of the garbage trucks arm... it would seem that stringent placement is going to be a thing.  I don't want to shit on this too hard... but our house is on a grade so pretty sure the stupid thing will tip over if put out like that.  I also wonder about the video showing the bins at the side of a house.  bylaw for not doing so about to land - even though the introductory video shows this is how to deal with the garbage cans on wheels.  Hazel - need some common sense back.  help!"
mississauga,2sgzqp,c74,2,Thu Jan 15 06:42:46 2015 UTC,"What happens if the new bins get damaged or stolen? Does the city pay to replace them?   It will likely be similar to existing policies for the green bins, you pay for a replacement.   Sort of confused what happens if you have extra garbage one week.   You deal with extra garbage as per currently, placing the extra bag with a tag on the curb.   This is about saving costs, keeping the city cleaner (ie. during the last windy episode, I had a bag of shredded paper break and confetti go everywhere up my street. I'm still finding it now..."
mississauga,2sgzqp,RAND0M-HER0,1 point,Thu Jan 15 13:40:57 2015 UTC,"It will likely be similar to existing policies for the green bins, you pay for a replacement.   the blue bin is like $5 or something to get a replacement.  i highly suspect these bins are pretty costly and how the heck to fit one in my car in the event someone swipes mine or it gets damaged.  the first good wind storm will have these things all over the street once they are emptied."
mississauga,2sgzqp,RAND0M-HER0,1 point,Thu Jan 15 18:28:49 2015 UTC,"I think the website said $20 for replacement of green bin, but these will be different of course as they're much larger. Toronto already uses these as I've seen them around, and they have replacements priced around $55 (varies with size). Has anyone swiped your green bin? As everyone is given one of these carts, there's likely little incentive to take yours. Permanently mark yours with your address if you're so inclined. Can't help you with fitting things into your car unfortunately.  They will not be any worse than the current rubbermaid bins folks are using (these carts are heavier) in a good wind storm."
mississauga,2sgzqp,DKsan,1 point,Thu Jan 15 21:50:23 2015 UTC,maybe i'm just bitchy about it... but seems like one of those ideas where someone pitched a cost savings to the city and the city jumped without thinking of all the extra hassle passed on the residents... and of course extra costs passed on to the residents.
mississauga,2sgzqp,c74,1 point,Fri Jan 16 06:05:56 2015 UTC,"It's good to be critical of changes and not accept to simply be told ""this is better."" I encourage you to conduct your own due diligence and speak to  the waste department staff for clarification. They respond quite promptly to the online ""contact us"" form.  Just from my personal point of view:   Peel is not a pioneer of this system, but I cannot say if the other cities using this are better off. I presume they looked at other's before implementation and identified success elsewhere. I like that I no longer have to buy a garbage can. The cheap rubbermaid ones will run you $20-30 themselves and they break rather easily. These carts should be similar to the commercial ones used for offices, so they're heavier and tougher and more stable (larger square flat base). I'm not a fan of biweekly collection, but that's probably one of the ways they are saving money. Making city services more cost-effective is something I always encourage as long as service quality does not tangibly diminish (tangibly in the sense that the point of the service is not effected, personal ancillary preferences are not included in this). There is no indication of an increase in fees/costs due to this change...."

mississauga,2rsapo,ZebracurtainZ,7,Thu Jan 8 21:30:47 2015 UTC,"Depends where your job in mississauga is located. If you can walk from a go station to your job, I'd say do it. I used to take the go train from cooks ville to union station, then a subway North to get to work.  Avoid driving at all costs. If you can live close to union and your job is located close to a go station that heads to union, do it. We need more info."
mississauga,2rsapo,speedstix,2,Thu Jan 8 22:27:06 2015 UTC,"Agreed, if we knew where the job in Mississauga was it would really help. Airport, Square One, Meadowvale, anywhere along lakeshore is a breeze to get to. But if it's at heartland or Streetsville, it'd be a different story."

mississauga,2rsapo,tbnk,3,Fri Jan 9 01:58:26 2015 UTC,What everyone else has missed so far is that that area has amazing rush hour connectivity to Toronto. MiWay runs route 108 Meadowvale Business Express which means you have a 1-seat ride to and from the subway.  I'd say working at this address while living in the city and commuting to work by transit would be quite feasible. Thousands of workers in that area already travel from Toronto and the express buses are designed just for them.
mississauga,2rsapo,JoanOfArctic,1 point,Fri Jan 9 06:55:36 2015 UTC,"The 108 takes 35 minutes then a 10 minute walk from islington. It wouldn't let me choose Kipling. Add a 10 minute walk to the subway, and a 20-30 minute subway ride (Union would be closer to 40-50 minutes) and that is still a terrible commute."
mississauga,2rsapo,Newmex,1 point,Fri Jan 9 17:52:21 2015 UTC,"I think Meadowvale GO station would make more sense than trying to get to the subway via transit, it's only 2 km away. Regular service, and some times of the day you can get downtown in around 40 minutes or so.  Personally, I'd find an apartment in Meadowvale, ideally close to Go service, for easy commute. If you want to go downtown for whatever on the weekends, pretty easy to do. With cheaper rent in Meadowvale versus downtown, you could afford to get a hotel room occasionally if you wanted to stay in city overnight."
mississauga,2rsapo,worpete,2,Sat Jan 10 04:05:25 2015 UTC,It will take you over an hour with public transportation to get to work from Union. Also driving through the core will be less than pleasant.
mississauga,2rsapo,JoanOfArctic,1 point,Fri Jan 9 03:34:14 2015 UTC,"Ok so you're just north of the 401 at mississauga Rd, very close to where I work. Like I said in my earlier reply, most of my coworkers commute in from Toronto, although the majority live in the west end. It takes them 40-45 minutes in the morning, but they're not aiming for 9am, more like 8am. And we don't leave before 6 most days either.  I live directly south, near Clarkson, only 16km away or so but there's no North-south highway (the 407 doesn't count) and it routinely takes me 30-35 minutes. So I'm not saving much time by living in Mississauga."
mississauga,2rsapo,JoanOfArctic,1 point,Fri Jan 9 03:37:14 2015 UTC,My boss at this new job was actually my boss her in Sask. before she moved this summer. I know she lives in the city (close to downtown I believe) and drives every day. I wasn't planning on bringing my vehicle but I might have to.
mississauga,2rsapo,JoanOfArctic,2,Fri Jan 9 03:49:21 2015 UTC,"Whether you live in Mississauga or Toronto, I'd strongly suggest you bring the car if you'll be working in Mississauga.

mississauga,2rsapo,darkstar3333,1 point,Fri Jan 9 04:12:13 2015 UTC,Car insurance and parking are the reason's I didn't want to bring it. I've been in Toronto before and think I could survive without a car as long as I can get the commute figured out.
mississauga,2rsapo,lightoasis,2,Fri Jan 9 04:21:27 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understood my point: transit in Toronto is fine and surviving without a car is completely doable, if you only need to get around in Toronto. An existence that includes Mississauga but does not include a personal vehicle, outside of a few select areas (your new office is nowhere near one of them) would be miserable indeed.  A lot of places in Toronto will have free parking for residents."

mississauga,2rsapo,melaniemad,2,Thu Jan 15 00:18:57 2015 UTC,No I totally understand. Maybe I underestimated how shitty transit is in Mississauga. I knew it wouldn't be ideal without a car but I thought it may be manageable without a car.
mississauga,2rsapo,xRyNo,1 point,Fri Jan 9 04:56:51 2015 UTC,"Anything is manageable, but it will suck. If you can reasonably afford it, bring your car. JoanofArctic is bang on with everything if you want to live near Union. If not, like others have mentioned, you'll want to live in the West End near the TTC. There are lots of buildings around the Islington and Kipling stations. These areas aren't lively either though, so if your main priority is walking out of your building and having all of Toronto at your disposal, then you'll want to be further east and probably at least as far as Spadina. Either way, if you want to get closer to the core, you're doing a bus/streetcar transfer to a subway stop that will take you to that Meadowvale Business Park bus."
mississauga,2rsapo,Mitoshi,1 point,Fri Jan 9 15:40:53 2015 UTC,"Lived in Mississauga for a long time. The transit isn't 'shitty' per se, but it's limited to the bus system.

mississauga,2rsapo,lilylemony,3,Fri Jan 9 16:08:01 2015 UTC,It depends where in Mississauga the job is. Mississauga transit isn't great and will give you a tour of the city before you get anywhere. You might want to look at GO train or bus service between Toronto and Mississauga. If you live and work near the lakeshore GO train line then it is a super easy commute by train. You can see all the available GO routes at go transit.com.
mississauga,2rsapo,coffeechikk,3,Thu Jan 8 22:30:34 2015 UTC,"Mississauga Transit isn't great, but it does offer some good options for getting in and out of the city depending on where you live and work, and when you need to travel.

If the job is in the northern part of the city (from lakeshore to the northern tip of Saugs can take close to 30 mins depending on traffic) this commute would be MISERABLE. So bad that I would suggest not living in Toronto unless you hate yourself lol.   Regardless, there will be a commute. It really depends on the location of the company. If it is on a main street in Mississauga, finding a bus route from a GO station should not be an issue. If not, it won't be difficult but it will take longer.   As for your obvious concerns about living in the city in a vibrant area amongst friends, I think you're definitely better off living in Toronto. Mississauga is not exactly an epicentre of entertainment; its nightlife and cultural attractions are put to shame by about 3 blocks of downtown Toronto. While there are certainly a plethora of young adults kicking around Mississauga, oftentimes a wild night out (or even a chill night out at the ROM or a Leaf game) involves making one's way into Toronto."

You'd be going the opposite way of virtually all commuters, so the best way to travel (GO train, not bus) only runs Mississauga-Toronto in the AM and Toronto-Mississauga in the PM on the GO line which runs close to Langer Drive and only a slower and less efficient bus service the other way around."

That something kids today will never experience, having to leave Mississauga in order to see a major movie release.   With so many screens now, even some more obscure type stuff winds up playing on some of the smaller screen at the giant multiplexes. When I was in high school you had to go to Toronto to see a Michael Moore or Kevin Smith movie."

She has made bad decisions in her life but always strives to do right by daughter Kira. When Sarah witnesses the suicide of a woman, Beth (who looks like her) she decides to steal Beth's identity -- boyfriend and money included -- in an attempt to begin a new life for herself and Kira, with whom Sarah hopes to reunite. But assuming Beth's life -- Sarah eventually learns that Beth was her clone -- doesn't go as smoothly as she anticipates because Beth was a cop caught in the middle of a deadly conspiracy, making Sarah the new target. Sarah must fight to stay alive while trying to escape from the complex web   wow, that is pretty intriguing.  Is it on netflix?"

At the end of the day, Meadowvale is not actually as bad as a sane person would believe but to me, most places I'd move into for the first time would be a downgrade lol. I'm hoping I'd find something like a 2 floor apartment in roche court next to the sheridan mall but its 1600+/m total, and I think they've officially started selling the flats as a whole instead."

These suburbs are hella large.  If you are set in the decision, our transit system, to my experience going about with a free miway card from UofT Mississauga, is somewhat pleasant.  It is a vast demography & disparity group at the expense of social interaction (there is emphasis on this because it is true.  Mississauga is large & suburban.  Character is non-existent lol) but we keep to ourselves while we have merit of goals, like you do."

They arn't dorms but they offer cheap rent, if you can put up with younger crowd.   If you can put up with drunks. Alot of the clubs out here are looking for door staff or bouncers.

There is no reason why you can't have a temp job lined up before coming.  if money is tight, do not fly.

And there aren't very many people who are in their early 20s who sign up for classes unfortunately, so your adult class is going to be mostly 40+ couples, with a few younger and older couples, very few single women and a handful of single men.

IIRC they are want to make it more upscale, adding 'better' stores and modernizing the food court.  Edit: Here's the article  Maybe I read it wrong.

mississauga,2r2ocq,Sportfreunde,5,Tue Jan 6 16:50:01 2015 UTC,Erin Mills Town Centre was my favourite mall before. I guess it'll have the same layout even after renovations but it had a better charm before I guess.   Although if it means a better food court then great

The EMTC renovations I really do not understand. Frankly I could not care less about the clock tower (iconic as it may be). If I was going to renovate that mall, I wouldn't have removed one useless portion and replaced it with another useless portion. I'd have built another floor on that to add more store space as well as adding free WiFi."

Now with so many better places to stay at comparable prices they are lucky to get a few guests a week. I guess its enough to pay the taxes and other things.

mississauga,2qnus9,swrdfish,1 point,Mon Dec 29 03:23:02 2014 UTC,"I think realistically the starting point in a city like Mississauga would be in a new condo building. If the developer ran fiber to each unit, the condo board could arrange a shared connection for the entire building. They could split the cost via Condo fees, sort of like how some buildings give all the residents access to cable TV.  I haven't heard of anyone in Toronto doing this, but I read about a company in Vancouver that was pitching it for a few new buildings. Here's the article"
mississauga,2qnus9,karlos349,6,Wed Dec 31 18:17:27 2014 UTC,"Biggest roadblock: Rogers and Bell.  These guys would be throwing everything they have at the project to derail it. Money, politics, legal processes, dirty tactics, anything you can imagine they would use. This would undercut their core business (which would be awesome) and leave them with nothing to offer in broadband (again, awesome).  The reason these smaller cities are able to undergo these projects without interference is because of the very fact that they are small. The bigger companies either don't care or just can't be bothered with small fish. However, a larger city like Mississauga represents a huge portion of their business and they'll fight to keep out healthy competition.  Another thing to mention (but I don't know to what extent this applies to in Mississauga) is that many towns in the US tried to create a municipal fiber network only to find out that the local big cable providers have lobbied in the past decade for laws to keep that from happening. They convinced (or paid off) the local government to create laws that protected the big providers. The SOP being that once the law was in place they simply left things as is, leaving these small communities with just better than dialup connections.  All of that being said, check out these guys. They're mostly Toronto based with very limited availability, but still encouraging:  http://coextro.com/home.html#!/internet  http://beanfield.com/high-speed-internet.html  Edit: there are also these guys, but I can't tell what area's they service: http://www.fibrestream.ca/Internet  And for those of you in the Grey Bruce region: http://www.wightman.ca/residential/internet/packages-pricing.php  Edit2: These guys are doing interesting work for western Ontario: http://swiftnetwork.ca/  These guys are offering 1Gbps in the Toronto are, but again availability is limited: https://dotto-one.com/services/"

We notified the condominium management and they told us they would get the police involved since I imagine it is illegal and it seems that they target apartment and condo parking lots.

mississauga,2qmmny,MFK,3,Sun Dec 28 17:25:05 2014 UTC,As for late night trips. I'm sure you already know but its worth mentioning that the train only runs during rush hours. There are busses at all other times.
mississauga,2qmmny,yawaramin,2,Sun Dec 28 19:37:51 2014 UTC,"I read once that if you forget to tap off the card when you get off, the next time you use it you will be charged the amount as if you had travelled to the end of the line. But as you say, Union is the end of the line. So I'm not sure. I would call up Presto and ask them. Failing that, I might try it just once, with the understanding that I might lose $10 or so if I'm wrong. But if not, of course, that makes things much more convenient when going to Union.  Btw, since you're using Presto I highly recommend setting up autoload from your credit card. I've done it for several years now and never had a problem, and never had to think about it after initial setup. Minimum $20 balance and $40 reload should do it."
mississauga,2qmmny,mailto_devnull,5,Sun Dec 28 19:25:55 2014 UTC,"yep, Union is end of the Milton line, but it gets expensive every time you forget on the LSW ;)"
mississauga,2qmmny,oalrusheidat,2,Mon Dec 29 15:11:06 2014 UTC,"If you setup a default trip (at any GO Transit station/terminal with an attendant), then you won't have to tap off. It'll just assume you're going to that default location. If you ever go further or closer, you'll have to override your tap, so as not to be charged for the whole trip.  In your case, it's best to just tap off at your final destination. Takes a second and saves you from having a locked up card. If you don't tap off, your card will have an unadjusted balance and it'll have to manually be adjusted at a station/terminal.  Welcome to Mississauga!"
mississauga,2qmmny,doublethedee,2,Sun Dec 28 20:17:30 2014 UTC,"If you do set up a default trip, remember that it only works for the GO train and not GO bus. You always need to tap off when on the GO bus :)"
mississauga,2qmmny,mikefightmaster,1 point,Wed Dec 31 19:07:01 2014 UTC,"Welcome friend!  I freelance downtown, and take the GO Train occasionally - but on the West Lakeshore Line so it keeps going beyond Union. I tap on and off. However you can set it up so you only need to tap on if you know that's the only way you're gonna take the train.   And in terms of safety - I've been taking the GO Train on my own since I was 13 (be it to go to concerts downtown or work) and have taken it home late many many times. Occasionally you get some weird characters at Union, but it's brightly lit and there's always tons of people around so I've never felt unsafe."
mississauga,2qglmu,pretyflyforanarabguy,5,Fri Dec 26 18:03:01 2014 UTC,"I love Kariya Park in the summer, just outside Square One area Toronto most often, or the Courtneypark Plaza is nearby, movies and some nice food No sports for me Fit4Less around Mississauga and Mississauga for sure Presto is so worth it, costs nothing I believe and you get a discount on transit, no reason not to have one  I'm into Hakka Chinese, so Chilli Chicken House (Creditview and Burnhamthorpe) and Chine Garden. My gf loves Italian food so Aliolies or however you spell it. Went to Mondellos in Streetsville once and the food was spectacular as well, great service too"
mississauga,2qglmu,m13b,6,Sat Dec 27 01:08:03 2014 UTC,"Welcome!  1) a little vague but all good! Bars are always a great place to meet people, the Port Credit Pump, Crooked Cue etc. are good places around that area. My home is pretty sweet too.  2) If you have a dog a recommend going to Jack Darling park on Lakeshore in between Port Credit and Clarkson. Great place to meet people. Super cliché but coffee shops are great to meet people. Starbucks right in P.C is real busy and a great place.  3) Hershey centre. I'm starting mens league in January and I know they have drop in pickup games during the week (or at least they did last year). If you're into hockey Iceland (across the street from Hershey) does pickup during the week for like $7.   4) I go to Xcel fitness. It's in Port Credit. If you haven't guessed by now I live here. I like it because it's cheap, have all the machines you need and they also offer boxing, yoga and all that shit. Only busy during rush hour (5pm-7ish)  5) Get a presto card and just put $40 on it or so. Just so much easier to have it loaded when you need to use it.   6) Mississauga is packed with underrated places to eat. The Clarkson pump has great food. Burrito Boys (multiple locations), Burger Priest if you feel like dropping 20 bones on a dinky, but good burger. I've lived here my whole life pm me if you need anything else BRO"
mississauga,2qglmu,canuckdarthacker,3,Fri Dec 26 22:46:22 2014 UTC,"Depends on what I want to do at the time. The gym, Church, and library. I like sports, I'm theoretically allowed to play sports, medically if I play sports I'll be needing Advil dumped into my mouth using a snow shovel. I go to Lifetime. I pay through the nose and then some but they're open at oh-dark-early until midnight most days including holidays. I'm pretty sure that there could be an alien invasion and they'd stay open...and try to sell fitness packages to the aliens as well. I don't know. I hardly go downtown. Depends on my mood. Indian I go to Nirvana (Hurontario and Brunel), Chinese I like Sam Woo (Mavis and Eglinton), etc. Lazziz has pretty good Shawarma."
mississauga,2qglmu,RogueViator,2,Fri Dec 26 19:27:58 2014 UTC,"Welcome to Mississauga!  1.Favorite spot? My home honestly. Not that I don't go out often but I always go out to Toronto for that. 2. Again, Toronto... 3. 2 places. YMCA near burnamthorpe and confederation and the hershey center they both do pick up indoor soccer 4. I would say any gym at any community center is really good. It's cheap and there is always very few people that go or know about it. 5. Yes they are definitely worth it. 6. This is a tough one because it really depends on what you're on the mood for.   Enjoy your stay!"
mississauga,2qglmu,dimalisher,2,Fri Dec 26 18:30:22 2014 UTC,Meeting people here is hard because its so suburban so you have to force yourself to go out and join stuff.
mississauga,2qglmu,Markg1000,2,Fri Dec 26 22:30:47 2014 UTC,honestly ive had a hard time meeting people here
mississauga,2qglmu,Markg1000,2,Sat Dec 27 03:20:40 2014 UTC,"1) All the parks and especially anywhere near square one. The nature trails are amazing everywhere! I usually just bike around or just walk about. Even at night it's pretty dope. I really like how Mississauga focuses the conservation of natural areas.   2) School and/or religion (school) it's hard to meet people just out of the blue but the people here are very friendly! Especially the bus drivers, they're not like TTC drivers at all lol. I don't really do anything extra-curricular so there's really other median of communication.   3) I don't like soccre but all my friends drop into either Hershey Center, or just play at a park. Applewood Heights Park, Kingsbridge Park, Erin Dale (One by UniversityOfMissisauga) Park.  4) I used to go to Anytime Fitness, it was 50$/ month and I got it because it was open anytime. If you're committed than it's worth it but eh, I'm not a physically-active person.   5) Yes definitely if you do drive just insurance and that's it otherwise Mississauga's kind of annoying to get around. The buses do make it convenient but I don't like their timings with the exception of the main roads (Dundas,Hurontario,Eglinton)  6) Everywhere! Pho: Eglinton and Hurontario Indian/Brown: Newynn Centre, Heartland. Afghan: Bamiyan Kabob Thai: Thai express because Idk anything else. Asian/Chinese: Bao Shin (I think the name changed) near TL Kennedy / Hurontario and Dundas"
mississauga,2qglmu,xsmiley,2,Sat Dec 27 03:41:45 2014 UTC,"1) Whats you're favorite spot in Mississauga?  I like to go for long walks surrounded by trees and lacking in humans.  Erindale park is one of the better venues for this within the city, and right in your backyard.  2) Favorite place to meet people?  In your position, I'd probably join some intramural sports teams, I'm sure UofT@Mississauga has some?  Or Sheridan or whatever.  3) If you like sports, where do you go in Mississauga to play it? (im specifically looking for places to play pick up soccer)  See above.  4) Favorite Gym and why? How much do you pay  I pay $20/mo for a 24/hr full facility gym.  I'm not telling you where because it's busy enough already.  5) I plan on traveling to downtown a couple of times every month. Although I should get my license soon, is it worth having one of those presto bus passes that i've seen people use on GO trains?  The presto pass is worth it, you save money on every trip.  Just make sure you register it so that if it gets lost you can get the balance back.  Also, make sure you look into the cost of insurance for a new driver in Mississauga before you start going down that road - it'll likely be 4 - 5 k/year.  6) Favorite place to eat?  Urban Social"
mississauga,2qglmu,JoanOfArctic,2,Sat Dec 27 08:03:01 2014 UTC,"Welcome! I moved here just over a year ago and have been seeking out many of the things you inquire about..  1) Port Credit is a lovely place to spend a nice day... Parks and shops are lovely.. Has real small town feel even though it's completely gentrified....  2) I don't know how old you are but if you're in your 20's I'd imagine West 50 might be a good place to meet other young people.. Other than that It's good to seek out the people with similar hobbies as you, there are tons of groups to get involved in whether it's sports or some manner of geekery..   3) Average Joes Sport League is great! Great way to get exercise and meet people! https://www.averagejoesports.ca/  4) I don't believe in gyms as anyone can keep fit with 15 minutes a day and a space on the floor.. but there are tons of gyms around here, I'd check a few out before committing.   5) Presto is awesome... You can use it on all Mississauga transit, go transit, oakville transit.. actually pretty much every community in the GTA supports it... Not all the subway stations in TO have it yet but the major ones do.. It saves tons of money cause if you transfer from bus to go or go to bus the bus fare is cut to .75 cents and after I believe 12 rides in a week the rest are free.. I highly recommend getting it.. I even keep extras for guests when they come to visit.. At the end of the year you can print your transit report for your tax return too!  6) I generally go downtown TO if it's a special eating out occasion however I highly recommend Burrito boys.. and both for groceries and for delicious affordable hot food Oceans Supermarket is great: http://www.oceansfood.ca/store.html They have an Oceans sushi bar and oceans kitchen with all manner of cheap tasty stuff.. Also, best place I've found so far for affordable fresh meat, fruit and veg... A ton of variety too."
mississauga,2qglmu,Gosslinq,2,Sat Dec 27 15:18:31 2014 UTC,"1 Heartland or square one can be interesting at times, celebration square (right beside square one) usually has events from time to time. 2 Hmm, I'd probably say probably the best place would be the square one area, alot of people hang out there, either at the mall, the skating rink or the library and YMCA 3 There are TONS of community centers in mississauga, I used to play basketball and always had a place everyday to play drop in. Ill link you here   http://dropin.mississauga.ca/default.asp or check out the YMCA as they also have drop in, although its usually focused more on basketball (the one by square) it still has drop in soccer. It also includes a wide variety of other sports and activities for about ~45/month  4 Eh been to Goodlife and YMCA. Id say its up to you, most of them minus Lifetime are around $40/month, but in my preference YMCA has more to offer, the one by square one especially. Pool, two indoor gyms, and a decent upstairs workout area with tons of machines and a running track. I've also known people who enjoy working out at LA fitness, although it is about a 10 minute drive from your location versus the YMCA and Goodlife which are pretty much right beside you. 5 Hmm, it is beneficial into getting the presto, It only costs $6 for the card and you can load it up. I have one but if you're planning to go to Toronto from Mississauga from your location, its cheaper to bus to Islington station and take the TTC subway to downtown. The GO train is just more convenient, ie faster but costs more. It also takes you to union station versus the TTC which gives you options on where you'd like to go. For GO trains if your still interested its about $6.50-7 for 1 way with presto. My advice is,Get the presto card $6 flat and  Take the Mississauga transit to Islington and then the TTC subway to your desired location 6 There are A LOT of places to eat down here. Korean BBQ at Chako, Heart Sushi, Kenzo, The Burger Priest, Five Guys, The Fire Pit, Union burger, Square one has some places also, Burrito Boyz,"
mississauga,2qglmu,phased5,1 point,Sat Dec 27 19:41:11 2014 UTC,"Let me settle it for you. Goodlife is BUSY during peak hours like 3-8:30ish, working out between those times can be quite difficult as almost every machine is going to be taken. When I was there, I never went at those times after experiencing it. The YMCA can get busy also, but not as bad as goodlife in my opinion."
mississauga,2qglmu,phased5,2,Sat Dec 27 20:59:09 2014 UTC,"1) Favorite spot in Mississauga is Port Credit. Has lots of different things (port, restaurants, bars, etc.)  2) A. Bars/Pubs: Cooper's, Bier Markt, Franklin House (Streetsville)     B. Shisha Lounges: Haze Lounge, Mazaj Lounge  3) Hershey centre is good for soccer. UTM is also great for sports like basketball.  4) I go to Goodlife Fitness, but its not really worth the $40/mo. There's lots of 24 hour gyms under $20/mo (e.g. World Gym). The BEST gym is without a doubt Lifetime Fitness on Winston Churchill, however it is really expensive.  5) Never hurts to have a Presto Pass  6) Charlie's Caribbean Cuisine is my favorite. My other highly recommended spots are: Burrito Boyz,  Heart Sushi, and Eddie's Wok and Roll  7) Extra recommendation: Become a Toronto Raptors fan."
mississauga,2qglmu,nishanman,0,Sun Dec 28 00:29:20 2014 UTC,Answers for 1-4 and 6: Toronto  For #5 get yourself a Presto and GO it or if you live close enough to Toronto just take the Miway and transfer to the TTC. I work in Toronto and I do the latter. I also do not drive and cycle in the summer months.

mississauga,2qglmu,takearidewitme,1 point,Mon Dec 29 04:06:25 2014 UTC,"Depepnding on what Im going out for, Square One for shopping/walking around indoors, Streetsville for a stroll/grabbing coffee, and most of the rest is in T.O. Since the suburbs aren't designed for much socializing I'd say the best ways to meet people are joining sports teams, common interest groups, going to local bars. Look at the city's website for different sports programs at your local community centre, the Hershey Centre, and so on. No shortage of park space here. Fit4Less for a no-frills budget, a single-location Goodlife membership for more features.  Once you get Presto you'll never want to be without it, makes MiWay fares cheaper without investing in tickets, allows for easy transfer discounts and frequent use discounts but most of all if you set it for automatic top-up it makes commuting really easy. If you're topping it up manually just be aware it might take up to 2-3 days for your balance to be updated."
mississauga,2qglmu,beardier,0,Sat Dec 27 00:04:40 2014 UTC,Favourite spot is haze for a shisha spot and to eat fish and chips on queens and britannia they have the best philly cheese steak. And Hershey from 11-3 and 3-5 on weekdays and 10pm-12 midnight it's 5 dollars. If you want a buddy to reach with you I go by myself or with a friend we can go together.

Your area has access right to the Credit River via Burnamthorp and The Credit Woodlands.    2) My house, every one of my friends love all over and it's just convenient.  For going out, I love going to Coopers Pub.   4) Got a home gym because I hate all the gyms I was a member of before buying my rack and spin bike. I don't like sharing or waiting to use racks.   5) I go downtown for work a few times a month and presto is perfect for that.   6) Just found Godfathers pizza in Streetsville.  My wife is from Naples and says this is the first place that makes pizza like back home."

mississauga,2qh217,jimjones3d,2,Sat Jan 10 03:30:08 2015 UTC,This isn't really renting but go to EB games and get an edge card for about $15. You can then buy any used game and return it for full value in 2 weeks. It's kinda scummy but it works.
mississauga,2qh217,bleakwood,2,Sat Dec 27 03:39:33 2014 UTC,"It's their policy. Their fault. You can only do it once per purchase though. But you get 2 games out of it. And you have to get store credit.   A friend of mine who manages an EB says you can buy a recent release used. Play it. Return it. Buy another one. ($45) then sell the second one back as a trade in. Get maybe $30 if you're fast. If not, $20. Buy a new used game with that $20. Play it. Return it before the 2 week period. Get another. Play it. Trade it in. Etc. Etc. Off $45-50 you can play 2 newer releases. 2 recent games. And 2 old games which isn't all that bad."

mississauga,2q33b3,danosmanca,3,Mon Dec 22 19:41:38 2014 UTC,Check out /r/buyitforlife and /r/malefashionadvice   Both were extremely helpful when I was picking out my jacket about a month ago. In a nutshell -  layers are the cheapest and warmest option but can be inconvenient especially if you're not going to be spending all your time in the cold. Canada Goose and its ilk are overkill. I ended up going for a branded puffy jacket that was still fashionable.

mississauga,2q33b3,ateddybear,2,Mon Dec 22 21:24:29 2014 UTC,"I don't know why you would need a guide on buying a jacket. A Canada Goose or NorthFace jacket is total overkill for the weather we experience here. Go to a large mall, try on a few, pick something warm and wooly but one that can be layered underneath. A warm woolen scarf, gloves, ear muffs or toque are things you should be spending money on as well.  It takes me about 15-25 minutes to walk to work each day. I'd say it's good weather proof boots and the above mentioned accessories that matter more than a coat/jacket."

mississauga,2pqzn2,xsmiley,10,Fri Dec 19 02:45:12 2014 UTC,"This is the email a friend of mine received concerning that and trying to extend the times for that rink:   Thank you for your enquiry about the possibility of extended hours of use for the skating rink at Mississauga Celebration Square which was referred to Parks and Forestry by the Mayor’s office.  The rink is open daily (weather permitting) between 10:00 am and 10:00 pm and is patrolled all day on weekends, and between 4:00 pm and 10:00 pm on weekdays.  During the regular operating hours the City carries out regular scraping and flooding of the ice to ensure safe skating conditions. Under the City’s Parks By-law, public access to parks in the City of Mississauga (including Celebration Square) is not permitted between 11:00 pm and 7:00 am.  This restriction is in place to discourage undesirable activities in parks during the overnight period and, in the case of Celebration Square ensures that neighbours living close by are not disturbed.  Closing the rink at 10:00 pm allows the public time to leave the rink and gives staff the opportunity to carry out a final scrape and flood. Extending the hours of use of the rink later would require an amendment to the Parks By-law and approval of Council. The City would also have to consider the resources needed to maintain the rink during the expanded times for operation.  Please understand that the City must ensure that the ice at the rink is safe and properly maintained when used by the public. At present the rink is open 70 hours per week and meets the needs of the vast majority of users. While we appreciate the dilemma faced by students and others with limited time, opening up the Square to unlimited overnight use is not planned at this time. The Culture Division is however currently working on a Strategic Plan for Mississauga Celebration Square and will be addressing operating hours as part of this process.  Your comments have been passed on to the staff working on the plan and will be considered when looking at the possibility of adjusting hours for the facility in the future. We appreciate you passing on your thoughts and hope that, despite a busy schedule, you will have time to enjoy the Square this winter."

I worked for a vet on Lakeshore and we would have lost dogs brought in quite a lot and some of them had no tags, and the microchip company was hard to track down, so give them a heads up in case a good samaratin dropped her off   EDIT  Also, saying the dog is friendly is useless.

That clause regarding prohibited parking between Nov. 1 - March 31 is not dependent on weather (I think) (as it, not only applicable during weather where a snow plow needs to run by), it's simply active and you may have just been lucky until now that you haven't been ticketed.  Just because there isn't snow on the ground, does not mean snow-clearing crews won't be out and busy salting roads or such to prevent surfaces from icing over on cold nights."

When i get it, i plan to print off my email asking to cancel the appointment and bring the paperwork to a justice of the peace to see what they will about it.  sort of strange that i'm quite pleased that the city did not reply.  sort of wonder if my email had them cancel the ticket on its merit?.?.?.  wifey and i have a bet going if i will end up being out of pocket more or less than the original ticket amount.  She's of the mind that i'm an idiot to waste my time over a parking ticket let alone thinking i won't have to pay it... while i think i'd be an idiot to give money to such a BS thing.  quite honestly, the rational decision would have been to just pay the original ticket... i've now wasted probably 2-3 hours of my time over the stupid thing.... and probably at least another hour or 2 more before it is put to bed."

When that happens any vehicle on any street is subject to enforcement with or without an active complaint from the public.

I think it's been there for a year or two but I only noticed and tried it starting a few months back. http://lafemmes.webs.com/ I would think they're a bit more costly than Grace (haven't been there in a good while) but the service and atmosphere is a helluvalot better. Also, I hate waiting, so they're good that way too.  In that same plaza is a nail and salon place and they are awful, just a warning. I went there for waxing once and it was a painful, expensive nightmare. The woman had no fucking clue what she was doing, I couldn't believe it.  Personally, I disagree about Grace Hair & Design. In my experience (me and my best friend used to go there) it's hit/miss. Generally good, for the price point mainly. Depends on who you get, what time you go, and luck.   It's almost always really, really busy with all the seats taken and people waiting around by the entrance. It doesn't necessarily mean they do a rush job, but like anywhere, some do a better job than others with taking appropriate time and care (like actually listening to/clarifying what's been requested). That said, it goes fairly fast because a lot of their customers go there just for facial waxing/threading.   A couple times I was very unhappy with the quality of work done and the women who did the bad job just pissed me off. There's a bunch of people working at once, too; they take people on a first come, first served basis. Unless you know who you like best (and wait for them) you have to take your chances."
mississauga,2p5bw9,godofcats,10,Sat Dec 13 04:47:28 2014 UTC,"Is there a lot of land left to build on? No. Is there a lot of land that can be turned into new projects? Yes.   The thing that Hazel did over the last 30+ years was take all of the open Mississauga fields and sell them to developers. It created a boom for out city because there was a lot of jobs created, as well as keeping taxes low because as it was all sold off, all the money could be used to support all of the budget expenses. Now that all the land that is owned by the city to be built on is gone. We have lost that income. Taxes will rise over the next 20 years, but it's not going to be horrible.   So what is next? All of the old buildings are going to be torn down and built up. Our skyline is going to change over the next decade. Downtown Mississauga is just a start."
mississauga,2p5bw9,operatar,8,Sat Dec 13 05:23:46 2014 UTC,Where would you make a downtown....? Hazel and her horrible city planners opted for a gigantic mall rather then a downtown :-/ Even Hamilton has a great downtown but Sauga aint got jack
mississauga,2p5bw9,MoeVsWORLD,5,Sat Dec 13 07:36:04 2014 UTC,"Our ""downtown"" is essentially around Square one. It is being built up with the office and condo buildings right now. It isn't quite there yet. But Look at the Eaton Center... having a giant mall in the downtown core isn't a bad thing. It means that the population living closest to the core doesn't need to go really far to get all the crap they need. Which having an all in one shopping spot has an added benefit of drawing even more people to wanting to live there as well.   But we also have other little hotspots throughout the city that serve as big draws. Port Credit is a huge part of Mississauga, it is one of the epicenters of tourism and nightlife in the city. In the summer we have multiple festivals and special events there. Plenty of bars and restaurants big and small to serve almost any taste one might be in the mood for.   Streetsville is much the same, but on a bit of a smaller scale."
mississauga,2p5bw9,operatar,4,Sat Dec 13 08:12:38 2014 UTC,And that's pretty much it. There are like three bars in Streetsville and Port Credit's bar/restaurant selection isn't all it's cracked up to be. Development on the Lakeshore should be the city's priority. It hasn't been taken advantage of in the same way that Oakville and Burlington have capitalized on theirs.

You can't blame Hazel for not scratch building the city.    I have to ask though, why do you need a downtown?  Downtowns are a relic of a bygone age."

mississauga,2p5bw9,Ziggie1o1,2,Sun Dec 14 18:12:11 2014 UTC,"It's a pretty simple question, although nowhere near as simple as your answer.  What is the benefit to having a defined downtown these days?  How is it not more beneficial to having those same services evenly distributed about the city.  Look at Toronto, you can barely drive or park anywhere near the core.  Wouldn't it be better to have these separated and spread better.  Then you get the better traffic flow of Mississauga.  Sports people (if we had anything worth watching) at Mattheson and Kennedy where the Arenas are, shopping people at Square one or Erin Mills, old shop people down along Lakeshore, Arts people west of Square One.  Why do you need these all in one spot?"
mississauga,2p5bw9,DeadbyChapter2,2,Sun Dec 14 23:32:07 2014 UTC,"Ah yes, let's have no downtown core. We can be like Phoenix, a city no one wants to visit precisely for that reason.   First of all, you said downtowns are a relic, which is pretty clearly not the case, quite the contrary in fact. Secondly, yes, Mississauga could certainly function without a downtown core, but it would forever maintain its reputation as a boring suburb with nothing to do that just happens to have nearly 1 million people. The great thing about a downtown core is that so much stuff is all within a relatively small space, and in Toronto its all very easy to get to thanks to the Yonge and Bloor subways and all the streetcars. Most of the traffic problems in Toronto are caused not by the mere existence of the downtown but by poor city planning and the rampant construction going on all over the city but especially around Union Station, the heart of the city's downtown."
mississauga,2p5bw9,Ziggie1o1,6,Mon Dec 15 04:43:39 2014 UTC,"The city is a long way from 'being screwed'.  Despite being a major inconvenience, the traffic congestion will lead to greater population densities and thus more efficient transit... the city will build up as opposed to how it built out.  Landlocked cities that do not invest heavily in highway systems (for cars) tend to do ok... the ones that want commuters end up dieing - think Detroit vs New York, Los Angeles, Chicago etc.  Hazel kept the budget balanced based on making developers pay the city for new developments and of course Pearson... that model is a thing of the past for awhile now.  Old infrastructure needs to be replaced... and probably taxes will have to go up to keep the city out of debt.  Saying that, they'll ding building permits or whatever along the hurontario lrt and such so that the people who benefit from access to new transportation investments will pay for more of the costs than the people in streetsville etc.  At some point in the future (your guess is as good as mine in terms of timeframe) we will no doubt merge Toronto and the gta.. peel etc into the city that it really is.  Despite the political lines drawn on the map... driving from burlington to oakville to mississauga to etobicoke toronto proper to pickering, ajax... or going from mississauga to brampton.  The city boundaries are political and not really practical.  If we took a step back and looked at the big picture... beyond politics and jobs of the politicians... the smart move would be to have one municipal gov't to oversee the GTA."
mississauga,2p5bw9,c74,-2,Sat Dec 13 06:23:38 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure when or even if the entire GTA will be merged, but I'm 100% certain a Mississauga/Brampton merger will happen within the next 20 years.... and we'll have a giant megacity of Bramsauga. Or perhaps Bramcalesauga."

They said they could negotiate the fine down to $2X from $75 but not cancel the ticket.   In any event, I've had to resort to taking extra precautions. It's annoying but if they tow me, I'm prepared and will take legal action."
mississauga,2osp2m,throwawaylogin2099,3,Thu Jan 8 19:46:13 2015 UTC,"I'm moderately sure that unless the ticket has the Police or City of Mississauga logo on it, you don't really have to pay it."
mississauga,2osp2m,mhender,3,Thu Jan 8 22:01:40 2015 UTC,"I've had impark try and call me, saying it will be forwarded to collections. I ignored them and had no impact on my credit or had collections agencies calling. And if they do call, just block the number. These are private tickets and won't affect your credit.  imPark uses scare tactics, and that's it.   If you owe them a large amount (over $300) they can/will tow your car should another infraction occur. (edit: this is not the case in mississauga, mentioned below)"

mississauga,2osp2m,danosmanca,3,Thu Dec 11 21:15:37 2014 UTC,"Ignore the Impark ""ticket"". Not paying them will have absolutely no impact on your credit rating, driving record, insurance or any other record despite what Impark says. Any threats they make are completely empty. They cannot have your vehicle towed either. The City of Mississauga will NOT ticket or tow any vehicle from any property that is receiving enforcement from a private company issuing it's own private tickets. Companies like Impark often pay their enforcement staff by commission which encourages unethical enforcement practices so as a result the city will not touch those properties at all.

mississauga,2orjm0,tbnk,4,Wed Dec 10 02:33:30 2014 UTC,"There are no longer monthly passes on GO. The need for an estimate comes from those riders using day passes (the possibility exists they board more than twice) and those who do not pay fares (both legally and illegally).

The problem is largely their service.  If there are little to no people waiting for food, everything runs smoothly. But as soon as it starts getting busy (lets say 4 or more people) things really take a while. Many times there is only 1 person preparing the food, and this really adds to the preparation time. If I see more than a handful of people ordering food, I just leave as it would take too long waiting for food (I've waited up to 30 minutes for a shawarma).  I also wish they had a better spicy sauce... I really don't care for it."
mississauga,2olo9u,CaptainBloodloss,3,Tue Dec 9 08:19:00 2014 UTC,I went there on a Friday night at 11 pm. That place was packed. It took 45 minutes to get my food. The food was excellent though.

I can't count the times I've told myself i'll never go back, but I can't stop, the garlic sauce has a hold on me.   The worst part is asking for sauce on your fries, first I have to ask when I order & I'm cool with the extra $1. What I can't stand is having to tell the next 2 people that I paid the extra $1 & then get attitude about it as if I did something wrong. It's usually the owner, but he's also the best at making the food so whatever I guess."

Having grown up all around the middle east, I can tell you that no Shawerma is actually supposed to taste that way. The chicken is rubbery because they half cook it on the rotisserie and then plop it down on the grill. Not to mention the service... Horrendous all around.  For authenticity in taste and flavour, I think any place that cooks the chicken entirely on the rotisserie/spit is the way to go. Nicks Famous Shawerma, Paramount and even some of the smaller shops are much better than osmows."
mississauga,2olo9u,MoeVsWORLD,1 point,Mon Dec 8 19:56:54 2014 UTC,I'll agree with you that osmows is trash tier but then you list nicks? Kinda lose all credibility there. Id agree that paramount is probably as good as it gets in sauga

mississauga,2olo9u,ice-minus,1 point,Mon Dec 8 04:57:55 2014 UTC,"Osmow's Streetsville is crap, and I'm leaning towards saying the same thing about Lazeez due to their incompetence and absolutely retarded wait times..  There's an Osmow's in Brampton that is family owned and they make small improvements on Streetsville such as making an amazing salad, from ingredients that aren't in the pita bar, and actually mix it up in a bowl to order..   and they are far more efficient at clearing orders even when there's a long line.  so I much prefer Brampton over Streetsville now.  Although they only use 1 sauce instead of two, what's up with that?  Surprised there's no mention of Pita & Grill, there's more than one location and some days it's great - other days it's too salty though.  I mostly go to Hurontario & Derry location but original is on Eglinton   Pita Nutso, I agree with the guy above, they are one of the originals and at they should make the list as well.

There's another good one on Brittania and Queen Street by the chicken place where the guy marinates his chicken in herbs for a day before, that chicken probably has the best taste and it's a solid shawarma. Another good one in Queen Street on I believe Main or Tannery street and Queen Street a bit to the side, Chef's Door or something."

Starbucks on the corner of Thomas and Queen St in Streetsville is open until 11pm on Saturdays. I'd think it would be the same on weekdays. Starbucks in the Chapters by the Square One GO Station is open 24 hours. Second Cup on Queen St and Main St in Streetsville should be open until midnight. Second Cup in the same plaza as the Oceans grocery store on Hurontario and Eglinton is open until 11pm. There used to be a Timothy's that I went to in the Cineplex plaza on Winston Churchill and QEW that was open until Midnight but it's been years since I've been to that site so I don't know if it still exists.

mississauga,2nrmfh,keenynman343,24,Sat Nov 29 16:46:39 2014 UTC,"I highly recommend: Go to your local ""The Centre"" (It's not a temp agency.) Website - funded by the government, no fees, no hidden bullshit, completely free - sign up, schedule an appointment with an adviser and they will find jobs for you. They will ask what you're looking for and such and will try their best to find the perfect position for you. They will revise your resume to make it fucking perfect. They gave me some amazing tips to put down on it that I never thought of. They will help you with interviews, mock questions, good answers, etc. Let you know your work rights, etc.  How it works: They find you a job and will pay the company to hire you. So when you get your paychecks, the Centre will reimburse the company you're working at 100%. You still get 100% of your pay. The company gets paid for hiring you because people ages 16 - 28 have a significantly lower rate of getting hired at a job. So, by telling the company they will get reimbursed, they will mostly likely hire you. The Centre will protect you.  I was paranoid at first, ""Funded by the gov. This can only lead to a shit ton of tax fees."" Well, NOPE! My adviser explained to me all about the program and how the government gives them a budget. They have to spend their budget each year.   They have LOTS of resources. LOTS. They have events each week like, ""How to start your own business"" mini conferences and stuff. They have sheets of words you can use on your resume so can sound more technical.  I sound like an advertisement but I honestly love this place, more people should definitely take advantage. I got my first job with their help within a week. I got my best friend to check it out and he got a job in like three days. My boyfriend went last week and his adviser is going out of his way to score him a job at a place he really wants to work at. My boyfriend isn't qualified but his adviser and the company are in talks.  If you go: bring your resume."

Most aren't out there looking for you. You have to go find them.   I'll concede a post in reddit isn't the worst, but then you gave no detail on what skills or experience you have.    If you walk into a Tim Hortons and ask if they're hiring, they aren't gonna point you to the coffee and say go.   Finding a job is a job in itself. It's also a privilege.

Tap when you get on the bus, tap when you get off.   Honestly I've never seen a bus full enough that people couldn't stand on it. Standing isn't fun, but it's a viable option in a worst case scenario."

I'll probably have to walk down to Yonge/York Mills to get one.  Quick, quick follow up - can I link the Presto to my Visa so it tops up automatically like a Starbucks card?"
mississauga,2no0bg,yawaramin,1 point,Sat Nov 29 00:50:23 2014 UTC,You can easily buy a Presto card at the City Centre Transit Terminal (Square One). Make sure you load it up with about $20 at the time of purchase because topping up the card online takes about 24 hrs.  You can definitely set up your Presto to top up automatically from your Visa. I've been doing this for several years and have never once had to think about it--works like a charm. Visit the Presto website to find out more.

mississauga,2no0bg,Not_your_father_guh,5,Sat Nov 29 04:20:38 2014 UTC,"I would go Presto if you are making this part of your daily commute. The Go Bus service starts giving you discounts based on the number of times you've taken the Go bus (""Loyalty Discounts"").   But to answer your other questions:    You can physically pay the bus driver the price. But many bus drivers don't appreciate this, from my experience. Alternatively, you can always buy from a nearby Go Bus Booth (they give you a receipt-ticket). The 19 Buses aren't usually incredibly full from my experience, but if there is no seating available on the buses, people do stand in the buses. The buses do run hourly in the morning, but they run nearly every half hour in the afternoon until around 5:30pm."

I'm not entirely sure, but with that much experience I'd expect you to be making more money in this market.  Definitely try to get a better idea before you interview and give them a salary expectation that's way off.  Prepare to pay a LOT more for Insurance.  Like, stock up on lube.  Look into Teksavvy for internet - they have a bunch of options at all kinds of price ranges but mainly their customer service is really good and they're not Rogers/Bell  Move to the west end of Toronto (Queen West/Ossington/College area) for that funky feel.  Good bars, reasonably priced housing, TTC for all your transportation needs.  Main thing would be to get a job, though, and work the commute from there.  Google maps is lying to you if it says 30 minutes gets you more than 15 km in this part of the world.  This ain't Winnipeg."
mississauga,2nbrb4,JoanOfArctic,2,Tue Nov 25 02:44:03 2014 UTC,"I commented earlier and left out some things for fear that suggesting Toronto would get my head ripped off, but this person is bang on. I've been renting on my own now for 10 years. My entire life has been spent in rentals though. I lived in Mississauga for 25 years. 5 years ago I moved to Toronto. I found that rental prices in Toronto are far cheaper than in Mississauga and the reduced commute time to downtown was a boon. Check out the apartments north of Park Lawn and Queensway. Tons of awesome little 1960s style 3 or 4 story apartment buildings there, cheaper rent than in Mississauga, and close to the Subway. As for IT, it all depends on what OP does. Are you a computer engineer, a programmer, a help desk technician, a network engineer? You could be making anywhere from $40,000 and up depending on what line of IT you're in and how much experience you have."

And recycling can get pretty heavy if it's pretty compact.  So, if OP put their recycling out in one of the calmer 15 minutes, and also had a pretty densely packed recycling bag..."
mississauga,2nbzao,RAND0M-HER0,1 point,Tue Nov 25 04:45:36 2014 UTC,"Yes, but it's not exactly a light breeze. It's 91km/hr according to 680News. That recycling could get ticketed if it gets caught in a school zone that's how fast and hard it is, paper and plastics don't stand a chance."
mississauga,2nbzao,JoanOfArctic,1 point,Tue Nov 25 04:51:21 2014 UTC,"Not denying it - but I was out there a while back walking the dog around the block and I decided to get the part where I was walking towards the wind over with.  So yeah, do that.  Then as I'm walking back and the wind should be at my back... no wind.  At all.  Like, none.  Pretty much until I turned the corner and started coming back.  So if OP went out when it was calm, and didn't know it was promised to be so windy, it could be an honest mistake!"

You can't expect every delivery boy to do the same, so if you're gonna talk about how to stop getting papers on a public forum, I am telling everyone that the right way to do it is to call the office.

mississauga,2msww8,ahiddleston,3,Wed Nov 19 20:11:30 2014 UTC,"Here's the ones I've been to most frequently.  Cuchulainns  This is my go-to pub. It's always at least a good time and occasionally a great time. I can't say I've ever had a bad experience here.  Good beer selection for everyone with offerings from Canadian to Molson Ex to Harp to Innis & Gun. A seasonal beer here and there as well. There's one bartender who I will swear pours the best pint of Guinness I've had anywhere. The servers are friendly and always prompt. The live music is always high quality and a decent volume. Loud but not too loud that you can't have conversations (admittedly, you'll have to strain your vocal chords a bit to do it). I've got nothing but good things to say about the food as well.  What it's not good for is people looking to have a large, rowdy group looking to have a good ol' college time. No pitchers, no club music, and not much fraternizing with tons of other young people. It's always a very, very mixed age group. I've had good experiences with big groups of people who all prefer to sit and talk and occasionally dance. But don't expect something like Franklin House.  Failtes  It's alright. Overblown for the most part since it's at Square One, is huge, and is always packed. Charging for cover seems to be extra nonsensical considering it doesn't offer anything different than any other pub or bar around. Not even by way of beers. All they ever have are the usual kinds you could find anywhere else. Food is good but nothing notable. The service isn't particularly good but not terrible either. Though, on my last visit, the waitress was extremely slow and only visited once an hour to take orders for another round... though she also somehow missed someone at our table twice and they had to eventually go to the bar to get a drink. But I digress, that's not Failtes' fault. Just an anecdote.  But hey, if you want a pub to party in then this is the one for you. Even though it doesn't offer anything special it offers a huge population, awesome decor, a large and well done patio, and plenty of mingling. The only caveat is that you should avoid the stage area because it gets loud there. Otherwise, it's perfectly fine.  And since it's probably the biggest and most famous pub in the city it attracts some really good musical acts. IllScarlett played there a couple of months ago, for example. It's worth keeping an eye out for the musical acts if that's a draw.  Coopers  A nice pub tucked away on Burnhamthorpe. Probably the only pub I've seen that's livelier on weekday nights than weekends. Good good, good beer, good service. I've got no complaints about this place at all. Perhaps the worst thing that can be said about Cooper's is that it's not really the best at anything. A jack of all trades but a master of none. But hey, if you want a good sports pub then this is probably the best bet. Also the only one that has a nice couch area which is extra nice for lounging. Try their selection of poutine.  Franklin House  I'm not a big fan of this place. Always a lineup to get in, cramped, and largely disinterested staff. But this is apparently the young adult's pub of choice and if you're of university age this seems to be the place to go first and then Cuchulainn's down the road if it's full. On holidays, it's extra crowded for this reason. At exam times, it's empty.  Nothing special by way of food or beer. It's mostly just the demographic that makes this place popular. The bands that play can be hit or miss but tend to appeal to the same demographic that makes the place popular. Service seems nonexistent. It's the only pub I've been to that's basically standing room only and thus bar tabs only.   Abbey Road  An older crowd, late 20's and up, seems to be this place's usual crowd. Despite apparently being Beatles-themed, there's a distinct lack of Beatles to the place. At most a couple of references on the walls but it is otherwise your standard British pub. The location is surprisingly nice, though, tucked in basically the middle of nowhere as far as nightlife goes, between South Common mall and the Dundas police station. Their chicken wings are freakin' massive too. Definitely worth visiting on a Thursday for those 50 cent wings.   JJQ  Screw this place. The only good thing about it is that it has pool tables. Not that they're well maintained or anything. I've been there a dozen times through that phase of ""young and newly able to drink adult"" and never had an experience outside of the pool tables that could be qualified as good. Slow and disinterested staff, mediocre beer selection, incompetent bartenders. Last time I went, I handed over a $10 bill for a $6 drink and watched the bartender put my money in the register then go over to the other side of the bar and resume his conversation with his friends. Never went back after that.  Three Brewers  Okay, technically Oakville. But it's close enough to count considering that's where perhaps the second biggest movie theatre for Mississauga dwellers is. Not a Irish or British pub either but probably the closest thing I can think of to a Germanic pub. More of a restaurant than a bar, it's still great for small groups or dates when you want to have good beers and conversation. Staff is always friendly, food is excellent, prices are good. I'm including it just for the quality of beers alone. And it makes for a way better ""pub date"" than the other places."

I don't even think cawthra has any n/s buses, so to walk to it from anywhere will be insane, especially during the winter  I doubt that station will see much use, in fact I doubt most stations will be used efficiently. Only those people within a 20 min walk will go to them, otherwise they will just go to square one and board from there. I live close to central parkway and Bloor, I still have to take the 8 to sq1 as there's only the 53 that services south of the central parkway station but it only goes one block then turns. You'd think they would have made plans to actually help people get to the stations so they could be used effectively.  Aside from that, the transit way proved to be invaluable because we bypassed what looked to be a 20min traffic jam along tomken and east gate today. The new 107 route only shaved off about 5 minutes but the ability to bypass some traffic is great."
mississauga,2mq1ds,yawaramin,3,Wed Nov 19 04:31:19 2014 UTC,"Yeah, you articulated what I was thinking too: how are the new stations supposed to be useful if the local buses don't actually drop/pick up there? If buses go past the stations but don't enter them, that's just really poor, poor planning."
mississauga,2mq1ds,elombardi,3,Wed Nov 19 05:17:43 2014 UTC,"Do the local buses not?   I lived in Ottawa for a couple of years, and they have a Transitway system that works (maybe not the rest of the transit in general, but that Transitway does). They had local buses going to whatever station was there. They also had several bus routes that used different parts of the transitway, and the transitway more or less covered the majority of Ottawa, not just East/West.  Edit: All this being said, Ottawa's has been around for many many years."
mississauga,2mq1ds,yawaramin,2,Wed Nov 19 15:53:19 2014 UTC,"To be fair, I haven't checked the routes and where they're stopping now. But the impression I'm getting is that the routes aren't going through the stations, they're just passing by them and dropping or picking passengers up some distance away, forcing them to cross the street etc."
mississauga,2mq1ds,DKsan,2,Wed Nov 19 17:13:32 2014 UTC,Buses physically entering stations would detour too much time from the cross routes.  The 5 Dixie pretty much stops right on top of the station.
mississauga,2mq1ds,EpsilonSteve,3,Wed Nov 19 20:27:08 2014 UTC,During rush hour I think its utility will see greater returns
mississauga,2mq1ds,RAND0M-HER0,3,Wed Nov 19 21:39:46 2014 UTC,"Perhaps this is something that will be revised? It's a new system, and there's always going to be mistakes made that will ultimately be corrected in the future.   Providing feedback could be the best way for the city to create new routes that stop at the transitway"
mississauga,2mq1ds,skybike,3,Wed Nov 19 16:36:44 2014 UTC,"I filled out the survey they made and outlined those points made above, talked to a guy on twitter about it and he basically said ""Well, you can take the 53 south and walk to your final destination"" Great, I'll just wait 15 mins for a bus that will take me to the next block :S"
mississauga,2mq1ds,mhender,2,Wed Nov 19 18:54:36 2014 UTC,"Yeah I'm pretty sure after a MAJOR development like this, they will adjust the N/S bus-routes accordingly.  In fact, to assume they won't, is...in a word...retarded."
mississauga,2mq1ds,MeinNeger_,1 point,Wed Nov 19 19:15:18 2014 UTC,It seems to me that a station like Cawthra is designed for people who want to leave their car at the station but they really can't go far enough to make it worthwhile. Perhaps when the full transitway opens it will see more use.

mississauga,2mkv6c,c74,4,Mon Nov 17 18:02:38 2014 UTC,"FYI for dog owners: If you want to carry something to make yourself safer, you can get Sarge Dog Spray from S&R Knives at Woodbine Mall just off the 427.  Pepper Spray is illegal to carry, and bear spray is legal only in bear country. You'd have to have a really good argument to convince an officer why you're carrying it in the city.   The larger your dog, the less you have to worry about coyotes. Some of the heaviest coyote populations I've experienced are around Rathburn and Burnhamthorpe and Meadowvale, so be careful when walking your pups. Most coyotes don't want anything to do with you, but if they're desperate and hungry, they will get bold.  Stay safe!"

One night I was with a regular group at the dog park and several coyotes came up to the fence. I've also seen them crossing the Burnhamthorpe when coming home from work.  After dark is when they tend to come out, at least those are the only times I've ever run into them."

There's also Kariyah (I spelled it wrong, I can't remember what it's actually called) Park. There's so much green space around that they're littered through the city and will just wander around.

It ceased to operate as a hotel with the enforcement of the Canada Temperance Act, but continued to be used for commercial purposes.

They have several family doctors that work there, I see Dr. Ruby Alvi myself and she's a good doctor. I've seen a few other doctors that work there as well (she was on Mat. leave for a bit, but is back now) and was always satisfied with my visits.   I believe you can take one of the 19's that way? I can't remember off the top of my head since I haven't taken transit in almost three years now, but my family doctor is there and I used to take the bus to the Hurontario & Queensway intersection.

mississauga,2mfi89,RAND0M-HER0,1 point,Sun Nov 16 20:06:41 2014 UTC,"I'm going to go ahead and vote against this place. I had a doctor there ""Dr Sukerman"" who was the absolute worst doctor I've EVER had, just check him out on any rate my doctor sites and you'll see all the negative reviews. He literally used google in front of my face to diagnose me when I was sick and then looked up common treatments and asked what I wanted to take. On top of that it used to take 6 weeks or more to get an appointment! and the staff used to get into verbal battles with each other in front of a room full of patients waiting to see a doctor. My brother in law also had the same doctor and had the exact same problems.  If you thought this place couldn't get any worse this doctor gave me medication 4 years ago that was not supposed to be taken daily and said it was fine. I've been addicted to it and only now am I making progress to get off this terrible medication. I couldn't disagree more with this place, definitely AVOID.   If you want a solid doctor go see Dr Ostro. You can check out his info Here"
mississauga,2mfi89,spicyboldbbq,0,Mon Nov 17 22:32:37 2014 UTC,"There's more than one family doctor available at this place. Again, I see Dr. Alvi and I've never had one issue, wether it's the professional behaviour of the staff or any of my medical needs.   I'm sure someone has had a bad experience at every place (and I will also remind you yet again that I see a different doctor and my anecdotal evidence will be different as she is not your doctor), but I encourage the OP to check out everywhere and to choose the doctor that he or she is most comfortable with.   EDIT  Also, I've only ever had to wait max two days to get an appointment at short notice. Otherwise if booked in advance, I've had no issues getting an appointment"

A few mentioned the long wait times to book an appointment, and him being 45 minutes late to see a patient as he socialized with other co workers, I've experienced this firsthand. I just wanted to make sure OP knew what he was getting into if he was considering ""Dr"" Sukerman. I've been to several doctors and Ostro has been one of the most knowledgeable and doesn't use wikipedia to diagnose my illnesses nor does he misdiagnose me leading to a hospital visit.

There used to be this guy who worked there, black curly hair who got into a huge verbal argument with another receptionist. They were both swearing at each other in front of a room filled with patients, some children. Not a place I'd recommend to my family and friends based on what I've seen unfortunately.

It's true the majority of bars in Mississauga are franchises, but there are a ton of great places without having to look hard. Just off the top of my head: Failte, Cuchulainn's, Clarkson Pump, Crooked Cue, Mad Hatter, Coopers, Scruffy's (Haven't been in since they renovated). But ultimately i's more about who you go with and who you meet there. I've had a ton of great night's at Boston Pizza of all places, met a ton of really interesting people.

People who use public transportation in Mississauga will really enjoy this bus route. The stops are well spaced apart and facilities are very safe & convenient.   The roads between stations have a speed limit of 80km/h and because there are no other vehicles on it, the flow is quite fast.  I've made the trip from Square 1 to Blackberry buildings on Eastgate in approx 4 min. Its a hell of a lot faster than taking 403/Eastgate due to the traffic light.   Phase 2 has already started, and there will be a direct route across Eglinton to west mall.  Also, this route west of Erin Mills will connect up with GO bus for even more added convenience!

mississauga,2lp1p5,wopchop87,15,Sat Nov 8 21:17:13 2014 UTC,"I am very surprised to hear that members of my municipal government associate open displays of their religion with running the city. Religion has no place in government (or any business). When Muslims want to practice their daily (and Friday) prayers, they are specially accommodated and can pray together privately if they wish. But when Catholics want to pray, they have to do it publicly while everyone else waits for them to finish? (Oh, and others may abstain if they wish--as if joining in is assumed to be the default option.) That's just insulting."
mississauga,2lp1p5,yawaramin,-8,Sat Nov 8 21:34:08 2014 UTC,"Wow.  That's an interesting take on it.  Personally, I don't think religion has a place in government... but your comment made me cringe to think how short sited it is.    Go back about 30 years ago when I went to public school, and the 'lord's prayer' was recited before singing the national anthem every day before school started.  And, this was not the Catholic school... it was the 'normal' everyday peel public school.  Obviously, as time and the demographics changed this was eventually phased out... but it was normal 'canadian' / mississauga culture to do so.  I fully expect that the tradition of saying the lord's prayer will be phased out at City Hall with the change of guard... but wow, blows my mind someone would actually feel 'insulted' by this.  wow wow wow... being insulted by a christian tradition in a country/city with Christian heritage/roots.  wow.  /facepalm."
mississauga,2lp1p5,entropydecreaser,14,Sat Nov 8 22:36:01 2014 UTC,"being insulted by a christian tradition in a country/city with Christian heritage/roots. wow. /facepalm.    The founding fathers may have been Christian, but Canada wasn't founded to be a Christian country. It was Constitutionally secular from the start. Even if it was founded with ""Christian heritage/roots"" that's no reason to let those Christian traditions carry on to the present day where separation of church and state is now accepted by pretty much everyone. It is discriminatory, as /u/yawaramin said, to non-Catholics who practice another religion or denomination, as their prayers do not have the same presence in the council as the Lord's Prayer. It is also unfair for non-religious people. Mississauga is one of the most multicultural and multi-faith cities in the country and it doesn't make sense for its leaders to ""advertise"" this one particular faith."
mississauga,2lp1p5,entropydecreaser,-3,Sun Nov 9 01:06:46 2014 UTC,"but Canada wasn't founded to be a Christian country.   Semantics.  If you can not concede that Canada was founded on Christian principals i.e. the british constitution and in god we trust and all that...  2/. Yes.  I agree.  But hardly insulting that a 90 year old mayor is saying a prayer.  It's endearing and grandfathered thing where the only people who get 'insulted' about such things are looking to get insulted.  As dumb as people who are insulted that a sikh doesn't remove his turban when the national anthem is played.  3/. This is the kind of thinking that I've never bought into.... being you'll never be happy unless you have everything that anyone else has.  Reminds me of a single mother who used to report to me and asked if she could have some flexibility on her hours to cover off babysitting.  Sure, no problem.  Then it became a shitstorm for weeks for her and I, as a bunch of entitled idiots believed they were entitled to flex hours as well - because she did.  Ya know, tuesday mornings they should be able to start late so they can go out and watch monday night football.  This unfair attitude is all over reddit... don't buy into it.  All this is, was an elderly politician doing her thing with no ill intent.  4/.  She wasn't advertising.  Again, not sure how old you are or when you came to mississauga... but it was a norm in the culture to have the lords prayer said.  Being insulted by this is nonsensical."
mississauga,2lp1p5,entropydecreaser,6,Sun Nov 9 02:55:47 2014 UTC,"Your arguments are barely arguments. You're repeating the same thing: that people shouldn't be insulted because they shouldn't be insulted.   ""In God we Trust"" is American, not British. Anyways, we may have been founded by Christian Founding Fathers with Christian values, but (a) the values of our Founding Fathers included secularism when it came to forming this nation and (b) our values today (which is a million times more relevant than 150 years ago) are of multiculturalism and separation of church and state. Assuming that people who are insulted by this are going out of their way to be insulted means that you're not actually open to the idea of you being wrong. That's not the right way to approach a debate. No, that's not the same thing. The single mother has a very legitimate reason to need time off work; a reason that the other workers did not share. In this case, there is no legitimate reason to be reciting the Lord's Prayer at city council meetings. Even if there was, that means that there is an equally legitimate reason to be reciting a Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, Sikh, etc... prayer, which would still exclude atheists, agnostics, etc... I'll concede that ""advertising"" was a poor choice of words. In any case, you say that it was a norm in our culture to have the Lord's Prayer said. I'm only 19 so I can't verify or dispute this, but I believe you. I don't see how that's relevant, though. It was once a norm in Canada to send Natives to residential schools. It was once a norm to laugh at the idea that women should vote. It was once a norm to exclude certain refugee groups from seeking asylum in our borders. Obviously these examples are far more extreme than this one, but it illustrates that just because something is a norm/tradition, doesn't mean we shouldn't change it. How else can social progress be made?"
mississauga,2lp1p5,yawaramin,-5,Sun Nov 9 03:30:10 2014 UTC,"1/. You are right about in ""in god we trust""... wasn't looking to quote the usa as much as to point out the obvious christian roots in canada.  Poor example on my part, should have said 'god save the queen' or something.... and you probably would have argued that 'god' could be allah, ra or whatever god as opposed to the obvious christian one that this is based from.  2/. This isn't a debate.  And I do believe that people are 'insulted' are just and rational in their thinking over a 90 year old woman doing the same thing with close to 90% popularity for essentially forever in politics.... well.  no point in continuing.  3/.  I wonder... under that thinking... about the national anthems at nhl games.  I mean, they only recognize the team's cities and not the players countries.  It's discrimination.  we need to play the anthem's for anyone participating in the event and not doing so unfair and unjust.  gimme a break.  4/.  Who is saying that removing the lords prayer from Mississauga council is a bad thing?  I'm just shocked that someone is insulted that it was happening and gave some context of why it is ridiculous that anyone would be insulted."
mississauga,2lp1p5,EpsilonSteve,5,Sun Nov 9 04:13:42 2014 UTC,"No, I would not argue that. It's obvious that in God Save the Queen, ""God"" is referring to the Christian/Abrahamic God. What does her age have to do with anything? LOL with all due respect, you need to take an argumentation/logic course. The reason those particular national anthems are played is that the players are representing Canadian/American teams, not whatever country they were born in. The Mississauga city councillors are not representing Christianity. Fair enough."
mississauga,2lp1p5,Pierrechen,5,Sun Nov 9 04:27:34 2014 UTC,"I don't know if you're deliberately misunderstanding what I said, or twisting it to make me look ungrateful or entitled. But I'll clarify.  First of all, I'm not insulted if someone chooses to practice their religion at their workplace during work hours. As a multicultural society Canada's accommodations here are very impressive.  What is insulting is to make a Catholic prayer some kind of a default ritual or tradition in a government body where you frame it in a way that those who don't participate are choosing not to participate. That's completely backwards. That's like telling a Sikh that if they're choosing not to be a Christian, well, that's their choice. Obviously it is. But framing it like that makes it look like they're only Sikh because they're opting not to be Christian. That's insulting.  Finally, I know I live in a country with a Christian heritage and before that a First Nations heritage. I've internalised the idea that I get Easter, Christmas, and Boxing Day off, but not Buddha Purnima, Holi, Guru Nanak's birthday, or either of the Eids.  Mississauga is named after the native Mississauga peoples. Shouldn't we be observing their religious practices at City Hall?"

The hand written ones issued by private MLEO's are supposed to be turned in within 24 hours but that doesn't always happen and then it takes time for city staff to go through them and put them in the system. If it was a computer printed ticket then it should have been in the system immediately. Take it to a screening officer at the courthouse and explain that you forgot to get a permit and they will reduce the penalty for you.

Find out what degree they have and where they got it from.  Unfortunately, you only need a masters degree to become a counselor. Subsequently there are a lot of schools that offer 1 year basically pay to win style masters degrees. This comes with little to no actual training in counseling.   You want to get yourself a counselor who is well TRAINED. Basically you want to find someone who got their masters at any one of the major Canadian universities. Western, UofT [OISE], Queens, Waterloo, York (BUT NOT YORKVILLE), etc.   Avoid people with degrees from schools like adler and Yorkville, athabasca, or any school you wouldn't recognize as an established, credible, brick and mortar university.

mississauga,2l5ygw,mooselovesyou,3,Mon Nov 3 18:54:57 2014 UTC,"Hey not a problem! Just a couple of tips if you're looking into retail/mall jobs:  I know it may seem trivial for a seasonal or part time retail position, but I would suggest not handing one general resume to various stores. It gives an employer the impression that you don't really care where you work, thus the resume gets filed away. Have a resume and even a short cover letter specific to the place you're interested in applying.   What I would suggest is finding some places that are hiring and do a small amount of research on the company. Browsing the ""about"" section of a company's website is enough.   Also, appearance is everything with this kind of face to face. If you come off as frumpy, employers or even employees who are taking your resume won't give it the time of day it deserves.   Walking into a retailer armed with knowledge of the company, a resume that is tailored to the position you're applying for, and wearing presentable clothes (business casual) will seriously help your chances of getting an interview.   This is a guideline I followed in my years of working retail. Hope it helps!"

mississauga,2kis3u,sim006,6,Tue Oct 28 06:26:03 2014 UTC,They were extremely similar.  I voted for Bonnie because her ideas seemed more well-developed and her transit plan seems to make more sense.
mississauga,2kis3u,Coan_Arcanius,4,Tue Oct 28 09:44:21 2014 UTC,"Seconding this, when I looked at both platforms, the transit was the swaying factor here as well.

mississauga,2kis3u,sim006,2,Tue Oct 28 12:49:45 2014 UTC,I agree somewhat. I think a lot of people from Mississauga don't realize how big the city is getting so quickly.

mississauga,2kis3u,kabikio,8,Tue Oct 28 02:11:52 2014 UTC,I think it's unfortunate that there were probably a lot of people who just voted for Crombie because Hazel told them to instead of actually educating themselves on the platforms. I hope she lives up to the endorsement.

She's carrying on where Hazel left off and will continue with Hazel's policies- not of her own.   I see empty promises only because Mississauga is already very functional. The new transit line, however, I think would be a mistake. If TTC was accessible by one of these lines, maybe. But Mississauga for the most part is already very accessible.   Mississauga to Toronto is kind of annoying.    Not to say this is a bad thing, I just hoped someone would fulfill Mississauga's ""Leading today for Tomorrow"" notion. But I do understand that it's easier to maintain than to obtain.   To the first year of living in Mississauga not run by Hazel!"
mississauga,2kis3u,DriveSlowHomie,6,Tue Oct 28 05:53:19 2014 UTC,"The new transit line, however, I think would be a mistake. If TTC was accessible by one of these lines, maybe. But Mississauga for the most part is already very accessible.  Mississauga to Toronto is kind of annoying.    In rush hour, there are 3 GO lines (ok, two + malton stop) that go downtown much faster than any other method. The province needs to be on board with this, but there are long term plans to make it all day- this would be the the easiest and quickest way to get people downtown (or to Kipling if they are on that line).  Along Lakeshore, it's already all day. 30 minute frequency isn't amazing, but it's better than some of the buses we have.    The new transitway will mean a quicker way to get from city centre/403 corridor to Kipling. Many of the routes will terminate there (or at least Islington until they figure out the new Kipling terminal). From the end of the transitway at Eglinton/Renforth, they will use the bus only ramp to get on the 427 and take that to the subway.   We absolutely need lines to connect people to these lines that already exist that go to Toronto.   Short of BRT along Dundas, I'm not sure what else would be practical right now to connect with the TTC that wouldn't be better served by the transitway/GO lines."
mississauga,2kis3u,sim006,3,Tue Oct 28 15:17:51 2014 UTC,"I think the eventual plan is to also have SmartTrack or the second phase of the Eglinton Crosstown connect with the BRT at Renforth too. I wonder how transferring to that and then getting either the Yonge or Spadina subway would compare to going from Kipling.  A full-on BRT, or at least some HOV lanes on Dundas would be great though."
mississauga,2kis3u,derpage,4,Tue Oct 28 16:27:50 2014 UTC,"I think the eventual plan is to also have SmartTrack or the second phase of the Eglinton Crosstown connect with the BRT at Renforth too. I wonder how transferring to that and then getting either the Yonge or Spadina subway would compare to going from Kipling.   I know the original plan had the Crosstown LRT going to Renforth, but I don't know the status of that. Based on the stop spacing of the LRT and the fact that that phase would still have to deal with lights, I imagine it would be quicker to take an express bus to Kipling if you are going anywhere south of there. It would likely be quicker to get to somewhere like Yonge and Sheppherd, though.   I'm not sure of the specifics of smart track along there though. Some sort of express train from there to Dundas West and downtown would be awesome, but I don't know how realistic it is."
mississauga,2kis3u,faelun,5,Tue Oct 28 16:37:14 2014 UTC,"Is the 427 definitely getting HOV or bus lanes between eglinton and dundas? That's always been my concern with the brt. I know dundas down there has them, but they seem to be ignored sometimes and I can see that stretch + the 427 slowing the entire thing down.  And yeah, I have no idea what's going to come of smart track but if it does get built and does get to Renforth or somewhere Mississauga can easily transfer to it that would be wonderful."
mississauga,2kis3u,xsmiley,3,Tue Oct 28 16:56:30 2014 UTC,"Is the 427 definitely getting HOV or bus lanes between eglinton and dundas? That's always been my concern with the brt.   I don't think so other than the bus-only lane on the Dundas exit (and bus only eglinton ramp)  It's not amazing, but I assume it will take the collectors the whole way (as that's where it gets on/off from eglinton). Is the collectors that jammed between those two exits? In my experience it's mostly the express lanes that are the issue around the QEW/Gardiner and the 401.   When you consider the TTC subways have an average speed around 30 km/h when you include the stops, I think the 427 route will be decent for transit."
mississauga,2kis3u,acamu5,3,Tue Oct 28 20:06:38 2014 UTC,"You're probably right, I don't take it much either and haven't ever gotten stuck on it. Even when there is traffic, ideally they can re-route the buses away from it.  I have gotten stuck a few times on Dundas though. Especially in the evening peak going from Islington to the 427 it can be very slow. There's already a bus lane there, not sure if it needs to be enforced better or if there's just too much traffic (including buses). Hopefully the Kipling terminal helps, but it sounds like that is still pretty far away."
mississauga,2kis3u,m13b,3,Tue Oct 28 21:15:02 2014 UTC,"I can definitely see problems along Dundas, even with the bus lane. Ideally, they'd extend the B-D subway to the 427, and have a large bus terminal there, but I doubt that will happen any time soon (and as much as it would be great for me to extend the subway to Sq. 1, realistically I can't see much practical use of extending it past the 427)."
mississauga,2kis3u,DriveSlowHomie,10,Tue Oct 28 22:29:20 2014 UTC,Mississauga ---> Toronto via transit is much easier then traveling within the city via transit. 3 GO lines cut right through the city an they will be electrified eventually as well.
mississauga,2kis3u,cynicalbrownie,1 point,Tue Oct 28 06:27:40 2014 UTC,"YES! If we try to ""extend"" transit to Mississauga, either it will fail and no one will take it because the GO is much quicker or it will be very successful and the vehicles will be full a quarter of the way into the city. We're just too far out to make that work."
mississauga,2kis3u,zaniko,6,Tue Oct 28 20:45:27 2014 UTC,"But Mississauga for the most part is already very accessible. Mississauga to Toronto is kind of annoying.   I disagree. I used to commute from the west end of Mississauga to downtown Toronto by GO Train for university. That commute was just as long or shorter than I was commuting to work within Mississauga by bus.   Of course I lived closer to the GO Line, but travelling within Mississauga by bus is extremely painful if you're traveling a long distance."
mississauga,2kis3u,aaffpp,2,Wed Oct 29 16:39:43 2014 UTC,I second this. I find anybody who says things like that doesn't really commute in Mississauga via public transit. Commuting withing Mississauga is a nightmare.

mississauga,2kgooc,Rawrbomb,-2,Mon Oct 27 16:50:30 2014 UTC,Yeah and what are the chances someone from r/beards will know a local place to purchase beard oil.
mississauga,2kgooc,Grgy,3,Mon Oct 27 22:27:17 2014 UTC,Very good actually. Just like when I was looking for a place to find wet shaving gear I checked with /r/wetshavers and they pointed me to a store right in Mississauga. The likelihood of someone from Mississauga or Toronto being in /r/beards is much higher than them being in /r/Mississauga.  Edit: this post from /r/beards mentions a beard specialty store in Toronto http://www.reddit.com/r/beards/comments/2euqp2/meta_i_was_forced_to_trim_my_beard_after_it/

mississauga,2kckut,The_Lettonian,2,Sun Oct 26 05:43:58 2014 UTC,Quite likely. Either that or you stepped in something left by one of the horses.
mississauga,2kckut,RogueViator,8,Sun Oct 26 05:44:32 2014 UTC,Yeah I've noticed it too this past week. A part of me thought it was due to candidates spewing extra special BS for the last week of the election.

mississauga,2kckut,TheMasterOfNone,3,Sun Oct 26 06:06:02 2014 UTC,"One big reason is lake turnover.  Water is densest at 4°C.  During the spring and fall the top layers will cool and sink causing previously still water to come to the top.  This can bring foul, decomposing organic matter to the top causing that musky, manure odor you smell."
mississauga,2kckut,beardier,3,Sun Oct 26 07:52:27 2014 UTC,"Been smelling that every time I step outside in the Meadowvale area. After Ninth Line there's nothing to block winds blowing in fron Milton, so the manure on fields idea makes the most sense."

mississauga,2k8plo,x3nomik,3,Fri Oct 24 23:02:57 2014 UTC,I also would love to find some solid analysis of the mayoral candidates election platforms. Crombie and Mahoney's platforms look so similar. Is there any meaningful difference? Or are we voting on personalities (which there doesn't seem to be a lot of either)?
mississauga,2k8plo,thehuxtable,5,Sun Oct 26 23:21:49 2014 UTC,Here's a Star article on their platforms. There aren't any big differences I can see unless you have a strong opinion about HOV lanes on city streets.
mississauga,2k8plo,trademark25,1 point,Mon Oct 27 12:13:18 2014 UTC,"While that is quite the informative article. Why did they only pick those two candidates out of the 15 or so? I understand some candidates might be a bit more serious then others, but I am skeptical and the cut-off process."
mississauga,2k8plo,TheJackal8,2,Mon Oct 27 21:18:19 2014 UTC,It's not always the most interesting to keep informed on the issues but I'm trying to catch up.
mississauga,2k8plo,MatthewFabb,2,Sun Oct 26 00:25:10 2014 UTC,"My theory is that this is partly the result of Hazel McCallion being such a popular mayor for so long. People in Mississauga aren't used to being so politically active on the municipal level. Mississauga New and the major Toronto newspapers haven't generally covered it very closely, because once again this is the first time since the 1970's that there has been any interest. Hopefully they will improve in future elections.  Also the two front-runners in race for mayor are not hugely different. Both candidates come from the right-of-center and have similar platforms. It's not like Toronto with two right wing candidates and a left-wing candidate. Or say the federal or provincial level where the differences between candidates can be more across the political spectrum."
mississauga,2k8plo,WarnerTrustee,2,Sun Oct 26 21:41:38 2014 UTC,The Mississauga News has tons of election coverage. They even have a page dedicated to coverage.

mississauga,2k8n5e,peamealbaconsandwich,2,Fri Oct 24 23:50:40 2014 UTC,That's a strange route. Why not take the 401 to the DVP/427/403 then Gardiner/QEW to Hamilton?
mississauga,2k8n5e,EpsilonSteve,5,Sat Oct 25 03:36:21 2014 UTC,Traffic. Actually I think the 407 is still a shorter route since you're travelling in a diagonal.
mississauga,2k8n5e,peamealbaconsandwich,5,Sat Oct 25 05:30:00 2014 UTC,"Boogilywoo probably meant 401 to 403 to 407, that would make sense. 401 to 404 to the 407 is a major backtrack."

mississauga,2k1l4i,tbnk,3,Thu Oct 23 12:35:58 2014 UTC,"Ward 11 is primarily a residential area, so the major contribution to the city of Mississauga in terms of infrastructure that I can take care of is transit for people living here.  A number of people have mentioned that our transit is lacking, from a schedule that doesn't run on Sundays to just needing more transit as we continue to grow.   Making better use of the resources already in place is a good start, with more stops and more of the double decker buses on busier routes.  This may not sound like much, but transit is very important. When more people can get to more businesses easily, it helps them find work, encourages them to do their business there, and promotes more businesses to come into the area. It also fosters community, inviting more people to come to the city, because of these opportunities, and because they can easily visit friends and family."
mississauga,2k1l4i,BibDib,2,Wed Oct 22 23:33:51 2014 UTC,"Thank you for your commitment to transit. I work early mornings and late nights and because of the poor duration of service on almost all MiWay routes, I am forced to drive to work. If transit were available overnight, I am among many who would be able to choose transit over my car as thousands in our ward already do.   Would you support increasing MiWay service hours to allow 24 hour service throughout the city?"
mississauga,2k1l4i,acamu5,3,Thu Oct 23 12:35:15 2014 UTC,"If the budget allows for it, and the community says that's something it wants, I will support 24 hour service."
mississauga,2k1l4i,acamu5,2,Thu Oct 23 14:20:10 2014 UTC,"Increased mobility and connectivity would be achieved with even a modest increase in service duration. As the duration of service increases, the service becomes more useful to more of the population. 24 hour service would be the icing on the cake, meaning the system could be used by anyone regardless of the time they need to travel, helping us become a more transit-oriented city. Other places with 24 hour transit service have seen that it allows an increase in ridership not only on the new trips, but throughout the rest of the trips because return trips are possible regardless of travel time.  Thank you for your commitment, hopefully the rest of our fellow citizens see the value in increased transit service ."

mississauga,2jlxra,RAND0M-HER0,1 point,Thu Oct 23 01:53:28 2014 UTC,"Etobicoke is easy. I got dinged for only going 80 km/hour on the 427, but it was pouring with rain/snowing intermittently and no one in the slow lane was going 100. I also got dinged for not signalling during a parallel park, but they're minor mistakes that still got me a pass.  They'll take you through a few forty zones, so watch for speed limits, but I found it incredibly easy and was surprised that I passed on my first attempt after hearing all the horror stories."

So I think that may have settled him down. At one point I was going nearly 60km/h in a school zone (40km/h) but he never noticed.

By: Tony Wong Staff Reporter, Published on Sat Jan 10 2009  Biovail Corp., Canada's largest publicly traded drug maker, has paid $6.5 million to Ontario's securities regulator over allegations of accounting misconduct.  The Ontario Securities Commission yesterday approved the settlement, which includes a $1.5 million charge for costs involved in the investigation.  An OSC spokesperson said it was one of the highest penalties ever imposed by the provincial watchdog.""Disclosing wrong information sends the wrong signals to investors and destroys investor confidence,"" said Suresh Thakrar, chair of the OSC's audit and finance committee, in accepting the settlement agreement. ""These were serious violations of securities law.""  The company was also reprimanded for its conduct and is required to hire a consultant to oversee financial and compliance reporting.  In its statement of allegations, the OSC said Biovail failed to account for the creation of Pharmaceutical Technologies Corp. in its 2001 and 2002 financial statements.  The allegations also said Biovail had ""improper revenue recognition"" regarding its big money-making drug, antidepressant Wellbutrin XL, and that it overstated income in the second quarter of 2003 by $4.4 million.  Meanwhile, Biovail made ""misleading or untrue"" statements in news releases and in conference calls with analysts, blaming a truck accident in 2003 for the loss of millions in revenue during that year's third quarter, the OSC alleges.  During a company review in 2003-04, Biovail also provided misleading or untrue information to investigative staff, the OSC said.  ""We are happy to close a page on an old issue,"" Biovail lawyer Larry Lowenstein said after the settlement yesterday.  Last year, Biovail settled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, paying $10 million (U.S.) following similar allegations.  ""We allege that Biovail and senior executives engaged in a pattern of systemic, chronic fraud that impacted its public filings of quarterly and annual reports over the course of four years,"" Mark Schonfeld, director of the SEC's New York office, said in a statement at the time.  The current settlement with the OSC does not apply to Biovail founder and Ottawa Senators owner Eugene Melnyk, or former executives Brian Crombie, John Miszuk and Kenneth Howling. The hearing for the former executives is expected to begin Feb. 2.  Melnyk has rejected the charges, saying he will ""vigorously contest the absolutely false allegations of the SEC and OSC.""  Melnyk stepped down as CEO in 2007, but in a highly public battle mounted an unsuccessful bid to unseat the company's board of directors.  This is not the first clash Melnyk has had with regulators. Last year, he paid $1 million to settle allegations he misled the OSC over the trading of Biovail shares.  --end--"
mississauga,2japbv,aaffpp,1 point,Wed Oct 15 18:01:14 2014 UTC,"Feb 17, 2009  Former Biovail CFO to pay $300,000 fine  Brian Crombie was ordered to pay a fine of $250,000, plus an additional $50,000 in costs, by the Ontario Securities Commission after admitting he violated Ontario securities law.  Mississauga News By John Stewart  Former Biovail chief financial officer Brian Crombie has admitted to the Ontario Securities Commission that his conduct for the Mississauga pharmaceutical giant violated Ontario securities law and was contrary to the public interest.  In a decision issued last Thursday, the OSC ordered the Mississauga resident to pay a fine of $250,000, to be paid to third parties as directed by the OSC, and pay $50,000 towards the cost of the OSC hearing.  Crombie and two other former Biovail employees were ordered to pay fines as part of a settlement with the OSC, which also has several violation charges outstanding against Eugene Melnyk, the founder and former CEO of Meadowvale-based Biovail.  Under the agreement, Crombie is also banned for eight years from serving as officer or director of any public company in Ontario.  Crombie, who co-chaired the first-ever Mississauga summit of community leaders in June 2007, is the husband of Mississauga-Streetsville Liberal MP Bonnie Crombie.  In its decision, the OSC says Biovail misrepresented information in press releases and financial statements with regards to certain pharmaceutical tablets in 2003.  As CFO for Biovail, Crombie ""played a leading role in the preparation and drafting of the press releases in issue,"" said the OSC.  One press release stated that Biovail lost an estimated $10-$20 million in revenue when one of its trucks was involved in an accident. The company later revised the figure to $5 million.  Crombie served as CFO for Biovail from May 2000 to August 2004. He was vice-president of strategic development until May 2007, when he left to work directly for Melnyk.  Although he was CFO, Crombie is not a chartered accountant or certified chartered accountant.  ""He was assisted in the overseeing of the accounting function of the company by experienced accounting staff,"" noted the OSC.  Last month, Biovail agreed to pay a $6.5-million settlement to the OSC after it alleged irregularities in the firm's operations. The company has already paid some $35.6 million to satisfy U.S. securities officials who brought charges against the company under American law.  jstewart@mississauga.net"
mississauga,2j9o42,Leafs_And_Jays,3,Tue Oct 14 23:58:18 2014 UTC,What do you want to do? Just sit at a bar and drink? Or do stuff. I would suggest bar hopping. Start at Hurontario and work your way to the bridge. Start at the Brogue Inn. Have a beer and chat. You can ask to just sit at the bar. Once you finish your drinks move your way down the bars. Have a drink in each one. Choose a sit down place to eat at or go down to Burrito boyz. After you've both had a good meal and are nice and tipsy you head down to the river for a nice cooling walk and maybe even some snuggles.   Fun thing to do and its a perfect way to see all the different restaurants.

Additionally, I dont find paying $80-$120 for a park area for a few people to be reasonable and if I find someone on our spot then there is no help from the city.

If you plan on raising revenues, be specific as to how you intended to do this and how much money you expect your plan to bring in. If you plan on making cuts, be specific as to what cuts you plan on targeting and on how much money the cuts specified will save the city."
mississauga,2icsln,Akraz,6,Sun Oct 5 13:24:17 2014 UTC,"The solution is multi-pronged. The first action, as you know, of course is to look for as many redundancies as possible and eliminate them. The next course of action would be to try and raise new revenues, especially considering the fact that everyone thinks the development dollars are dried up. My RUSH transit plan, if accepted, would spur redevelopment and revitalisation of all of Dundas from Winston Churchill to the Toronto border. This, as you can imagine, would raise much needed additional revenues for Mississauga. The next step is to utilize available advertising space as a means to raise yet additional revenues. As an example, attracting corporate sponsors for bus shelters, and build upon that. You have hit on a very serious issue, considering Mississauga’s debt level is projected to increase to $450 million in just 9 years."

mississauga,2icsln,acetylcysteine,5,Sun Oct 5 13:23:50 2014 UTC,Finding efficiencies does not mean cutting services. They are two very distinctly separate things. Finding efficiencies is generally the elimination of redundancies.
mississauga,2icsln,thepuffytaco,3,Sun Oct 5 13:24:01 2014 UTC,"/u/DriveSlowHomie asked: Lol, the math isn't very ""strait"" forward. Why in the fuck would you move a rapid transit line from the busiest transit route in the city, to a lesser used route! The Dundas LRT is useless at this point since GO Lines will be electrified anyways. Seriously, this transit plan is an absolute joke. HOV lanes on Lakeshore sound like a nightmare as well."
mississauga,2icsln,Chef_Lebowski,6,Sun Oct 5 13:26:09 2014 UTC,"I disagree with you completely. I believe the math is straightforward. The entire master plan for the Hurontario LRT is several hundred pages long. If we look at table 3.3.1 on page 109 it shows on a do-nothing scenario that the highest usage for transit ridership on Hurontario is from Brampton GO to Steeles, which is for Brampton residents. As you know, Brampton has decided against the Hurontario LRT in their city. If you look at Bonnie Crombie’s LRT plan, you will notice that it ends at Derry. The greatest benefit to the Hurontario LRT plan was for Brampton residents – not for residents of Mississauga. Next, if you look at section 6.3.6.3 Long Term Horizon (Best Case) on page 270, it states: “The comparison between the base case and the case with LRT in place show the predicted traffic volume increase or decrease caused by the LRT availability. These charts show the following results: Auto volumes with LRT decrease by up to 650 vehicles during the a.m. peak period compared with the Base Case on Hurontario/Main Street.” The 3000 that I had mentioned in my platform was the math for the entire day; therefore, my math is correct. To your point, based on the figures I’ve just given you and to the areas that I’ve directed you to, congestion will be significantly worse with an LRT on Hurontario. Regarding the Dundas LRT and the GO electrified transit option, I don’t see what your point is on that. They are two different variables. By putting an LRT on Dundas, it will ease that congestion on Hurontario because people want east/west corridors. It will also redistribute or control density dispersement. Regarding HOV lanes on Lakeshore, that was never part of my transit plan. What is stated in my plan is, “HOV lanes on Hurontario from Eglington to Lakeshore to address congestion needs and more rapidly link to Dundas LRT.” I do not have any plans to implement HOV lanes on Lakeshore – I proposed a BRT on Lakeshore. A BRT does not have to be fully dedicated. It can be like HOV lanes in the fact that they can be time selective."
mississauga,2icsln,faelun,3,Sun Oct 5 13:26:23 2014 UTC,"That is the plan. If you go to my site the intended goal is from Dundas and the 403 connecting all the way east to the Kipling subway station.

It takes forever to get from meadowvale to port credit. Winston and erinmills, used to be ok, hurontario is a joke."
mississauga,2icsln,EpsilonSteve,6,Sun Oct 5 22:23:32 2014 UTC,"I agree with you completely. Unfortunately, though I will be advocating for such an issue to be addressed, it is beyond the scope of the municipality. The 407 does run north to south though for those who are willing to pay for it. Beyond that, Mississauga has no land that we can personally develop for a highway."

You know , where the 401 forks off to the collectors to Dixie...   This has always been a pet peeve of mine, especially the vice versa: a 403 northbound ramp to 40 westbound. Why doesn't it exist?.. I imagine the traffic experts have decided against this because of congestion already extremely terrible on the 401 WB at Dixie during rushour.  Is this something a mayor can control or province?"
mississauga,2icsln,hustlerbrah,2,Sun Oct 5 22:10:32 2014 UTC,"401 westbound does have a connector to the 410 to Brampton and the 403. The question is, what are you trying to connect to? If you’re traveling east on the 401 and you want to exit to the 403, that exit ends up taking you back to where you came from – you’re now heading westbound on the 403. Are you asking, if you’re coming across the 401, for example from Kitchener, and you’re looking to go south down Cawthra into the city, yes – there is no exit for that. However, because Hurontario or Dixie can bring you south to the same areas, we would never be able to secure the funding to build a Cawthra south exit."

However, these plans were altered by the Bob Rae government in 1995, due to budgetary constraints.  It was also announced that the Mississauga section of Highway 403 would be renumbered as Highway 410.  Ultimately, this never came to pass.  Consequently, Highway 403 was signed concurrently along the Queen Elizabeth Way in 2002, remedying the discontinuity.

mississauga,2icsln,Coshine,5,Mon Oct 6 03:05:13 2014 UTC,/u/billybobdobbs asked: LRT is bad because it takes away lanes from Hurontario so instead a BRT should be build along Hurontario....which also takes away lanes. Am I missing something?
mississauga,2icsln,THE_ONLY_SOLIPSIST_,6,Mon Oct 6 03:53:36 2014 UTC,"Yes. A BRT does not have to be fully dedicated. It can be like HOV lanes in the fact that they can be time selective. Remember though, that by putting an LRT on Dundas, it will ease that congestion on Hurontario because people want east/west corridors. It will also redistribute or control density dispersement. I also didn’t say that this is my plan – I’m not that arrogant. I said this is my vision, this is my concept. I’ve also said that I want the feedback, I want the criticism, I want the suggestions. The only real transit plan that will ever work is the transit plan that the people want. At the end of the day, everyone knows that Miway doesn’t work. There is poor weekend service and poor evening service, so people have a decision to make. We either build the transit system that everyone thinks or says we need, or we quit complaining about the cars and build better roads. If you have an effective, reliable transit system like the European models, people will get out of their cars and use the transit system. I personally wouldn’t consider giving up my car because our current transit system doesn’t work. It needs to change. The question is – what is that change?"
mississauga,2icsln,THE_ONLY_SOLIPSIST_,2,Sun Oct 5 13:25:08 2014 UTC,"You must have read my RUSH transit plan as phase 1 does exactly what you state. Phase 2 and 3 are just potential visions if the populous truly wants transit investment. About the rest of what you stated, I certainly can`t disagree with you. MiWay as it is now is extremely inefficient and encourages people to own a car. Remember though, that Peel region has a population of 1.2 million people. Mississauga is the 6th largest city in the country. Vancouver has a great transit system with elevated monorails. Unfortunately, to your point, unless society is actually willing to make the required investments and reengineering of the city that is required in order to have a truly efficient transit system in Mississauga, or Peel Region, not much is going to change."

Just don't light it under anything flammable, keep it a safe size, don't leave it unattended and keep the smoke to a minimum. The only reason for the smoke is that nobody gets scared and calls the fire department.   I do this all the time.

mississauga,2i4930,steveking4mayor,8,Thu Oct 2 19:15:43 2014 UTC,"Lol, the math isn't very ""strait"" forward. Why in the fuck would you move a rapid transit line from the busiest transit route in the city, to a lesser used route! The Dundas LRT is useless at this point since GO Lines will be electrified anyways. Seriously, this transit plan is an absolute joke. HOV lanes on Lakeshore sound like a nightmare as well.  I definitely know one candidate I will not be voting for."
mississauga,2i4930,DriveSlowHomie,5,Thu Oct 2 22:58:27 2014 UTC,"Wow, that is some incredibly faulty logic. The point of building an LRT on Hurontario is to reduce the numbers of cars on it, while increasing the number of commuters. Why do you assume the number of cars using Hurontario will be nearly* the same after the LRT is built?  *Missed the reduction by 3000 vehicles per day."
mississauga,2i4930,nasirjk,3,Thu Oct 2 22:21:11 2014 UTC,"According to the page that's been linked, 3000 vehicles will no longer be driven in favour of the LRT.  I'm not following your complaint.  As an aside, I'd also like to see these studies for myself."
mississauga,2i4930,EpsilonSteve,1 point,Fri Oct 3 05:18:56 2014 UTC,"OK, I did miss the 3000 fewer vehicles. But I feel like the LRT should have a more drastic impact than only 3000 a day?"
mississauga,2i4930,nasirjk,2,Fri Oct 3 18:12:46 2014 UTC,Yeah. I also don't think it is worth the investment if that's all its going to go. I think it is going to be a platform to build off of and when we incorporate it to a larger transit plan we will see a dramatic hike in ridership and a decrease in roads on the vehicle. At least that's what I would do and I'm barely equipped to manage my time efficiently.

mississauga,2i4930,grand_soul,0,Thu Oct 2 19:59:20 2014 UTC,"The Geography of Dundas street will make the LRT quite a challenge. WHat about fixing all the timing of intersections to deal with flow better, creating night time only construction on major roadways and replacing entire intersections with round-abouts to improve flow of traffic. the problem is not that there are too many cars, the problem is the way we manage traffic flow. look at the 403 West, the HOV lane has crippled the highway because you squeeze 98% of the traffic into 3 lanes. during rush hour just open HOV for everyone to use then restrict it after 7:30 again."
mississauga,2i4930,therealandrew,-1,Fri Oct 3 19:39:39 2014 UTC,"I guess it doesn't really matter a lot in terms of getting support at this point if you are steve king or not.

You might want to link to a twitter account or post a picture of yourself to prove you are steve king.

I have stopped supporting charities that use street canvassers as I also don't like to be harassed to donate.  I will inform myself and make my own decisions, thank you very much, I'm not one for face to face outreach.  The charities that currently use street canvassers/f2f fundraising by my last count are: I am a girl, doctors with out borders, salvation army, camh, sick kids, red cross, amnesty international, plan Canada, world vision Canada, st.mikes hospital foundation, unicef, and probably several dozen others.  Many of the canvassers are paid by commission which is prohibited by the association for fundraising professionals and imagine Canada.    Stick some ear buds in your ears, and ignore them when you see them.  You won't hear what they say to you and you don't have to feel bad about ignoring them.  Edited for spelling whoops"
mississauga,2hydum,neowie,2,Wed Oct 1 03:29:32 2014 UTC,"Wow, I didn't know CAMH had street canvassers. That's really disappointing to me. I also don't understand why the big charities would need them either.  I'll try to keep my headphones in my backpack for show."
mississauga,2hydum,neowie,2,Wed Oct 1 03:43:31 2014 UTC,"Big charities user them because it's a way to add extra fundraisers to their team without having to identify them as administration costs in their budget. It's technically ""public outreach"".  You know those pie charts that show the distribution of costs, and administration as stupidly low (like 4%?, when a typical service or research based charity is 7-10%), the charities bundle this outreach work into ""service"".  It's sneaky and underhanded, and I don't support charities that try to undermine and manipulate their supporters with these faked figures.    Instead, support smaller charitable organizations where your dollar means a lot more to them.  Volunteer with them and learn about their operation the group that they serve and the people that are running the charity.  Then you don't have to feel so bad about ignoring the canvassers.  There is only so much of you to go around, and you've chosen to give where your dollar and time have a larger impact."
mississauga,2hydum,mattbin,5,Wed Oct 1 11:53:04 2014 UTC,"Working at Yonge and St Clair I used to walk through a gauntlet of these people at least twice a day. It's bothering you because they use societal norms against you. If someone calls out, you assume they have a good reason and pause; if someone says something friendly to you, you automatically assume it's not solicitation. I don't mean to overstate the issue but they prey on those impulses.  Once I realized that was why I felt like I had to respond to them, to be honest it pissed me off a bit. They were manipulating me, using my automatic responses against me. That was when I stopped even considering them as people. When I see the markers of a street canvasser, now they're not much different from, say, an advertising sign on the sidewalk: ignore and avoid. No other relevance to me.  I also did the sunglasses and headphones thing (although those were on me all the time anyhow), which got me used to ignoring them. I could vaguely detect that someone was trying to get my attention, but it was easy to pretend I hadn't seen it.  And as I got used to not responding, I found it was much easier not to, even if I was walking alone on the street, easy pickings for them. And they don't bother me at all now. I don't acknowledge them, just feel a brief moment of pity for them, and move on.   The only time I interact with them now is when they stand blocking my path (and they do this all the time, it's another way to make you stop). If they block my way, I walk straight towards them and assume they'll move. If I get within a couple of steps and they don't move out of the way, I say ""get the fuck out of the way"" and that's never failed. It's only gotten to that point a couple of times.  Anyhow, think about why they create these reactions in you, and use that as fuel to feed the fires of contempt and anger. Then you'll never notice them again."
mississauga,2hydum,alfonsopoopoofatty3,3,Wed Oct 1 10:43:21 2014 UTC,"I just smile, shake my head, and keep walking. I make a point of not donating to any charity that uses them and if you feel strongly enough, absolutely complain. They should know that it's alienating potential donors.  (Also, if they yell after you to try and humiliate you, everyone is cheering for you for avoiding them. No one likes them)"
mississauga,2hydum,JoanOfArctic,2,Fri Oct 3 17:02:50 2014 UTC,"Ah, chuggers.  UK/Ireland were overrun with them during the recent(ish) boom - they mostly disappeared during the recession.  It's best to smile, not engage.  Nobody cares if they yell at you for being heartless - I personally prefer to donate to charities that spend less on fundraising.  If they get really aggressive, you could perhaps shout back and let them know that harassing you will not help them to get you to donate to their cause.  If you lack the confidence to simply ignore them, you can always just pretend you are on a phone call."

They're not high end, but I like them because Costco has this never ending warranty so if my bike fucks up, they'll take it back even if it's been three years.   I had two axels break on my Costco bike and I just exchanged them for new ones. It's a decent system so far. Just keep the receipt somewhere safe! However they aren't selling bikes anymore, they only sell them at the beginning of spring/summer.  There's the Bike Zone at Dundas just before Cawthra that might be able to help you out for non-expensive/find a used bike.  Make sure you file a police report as well, keep an eye on Kijiji and Craigslist. Some people will try to sell it. Keep an eye around the neighbourhood as you might see your bike around.  Also, as much as it sucks, you should keep your bike inside your home when you get it back/replace it. Another option is to get a bike lock cable and U Lock that you can wrap through the frame so EVERYTHING gets locked. This is what my brother and I have used for years to keep our bikes secured and haven't had an issue.   People from high school that parked their bikes beside ours had them stolen, but since all our tires and frame were secured to an iron fence, it's not an easy task to try and steal them.  Good luck!

It should be something you can fasten in front of your mouth/chin area, either with a cinch cord or some other kind of closure, and it should extend beyond your face a bit without obstructing your vision. The hood will protect your exposed face and neck parts from the wind, and it will protect your hat from getting any snow on it (which can melt as you go into and out of warm places).  A couple of other considerations are dressy vs. utility-looking (the latter is better, except for a job interview or funeral) and length (to your hips or to your thigh: thigh-length will be noticeably warmer and keep your pants and the stuff in your pockets better protected)."
mississauga,2hqhqd,DanLynch,0,Sun Sep 28 23:30:32 2014 UTC,"All of this. I agree that a good hood is super important. Longer is better as well. Try to make sure it covers your bum when you sit down. Cold/wet bum is never fun. Also try to find one that has pockets large enough to fit your hands inside of while you'e wearing mitts/gloves. If it's really windy your pockets can keep the wind off your hands really well. Continuing with the hands, look for a jacket that has a good closure around the wrists so wind doesn't get up your sleeves. I agree utility is better than looks."

mississauga,2hqhqd,mhender,1 point,Mon Sep 29 19:23:33 2014 UTC,"I actually answered this question on the /r/Toronto subreddit. I worked manual labour outside for a little while in my life, and my brother still does work outside sometimes since he's an Electrician. We both have the same coat, and it is incredibly reliable and WARM! I'm biased towards working jackets as I find they're built heavier and warmer to protect you versus incredibly stylish or popular (Like the Canada Goose, which are incredibly overpriced! Don't even go there...)  Dakota 600D 7-IN-1  It's $170 +tax, it has the outer shell and an inner removable jacket, pockets out the ass for all your needs (depends on your needs), it's like wearing a duvet outside. The jacket falls a bit past my pockets on my pants, has a reliable hood that covers my face.  And like everyone has said, LAYERS! Layers are incredibly important, wear long sleeve shirts/t-shirts, sweaters and your coat. I find the ear flap hats are the best for windy days in the winter since you can tie them down to keep your ears warm, or ear muffs.   But you can't go wrong with a good snowboard/ski coat, which you can get from most to all sports store, like SportChek, National Sport, etc. and brands such as Firefly, Columbia and North Face. I've not had a bad experience with them, but I will say my Dakota coat is warmer than they are.   EDIT  Also, if you're looking for a nice warm winter sweater, Mark's sells T-MAX Hoodies that are crazy warm! They're denser than regular hoodies, but I enjoy having mine for the start of winter when it's too cold for just a sweater and long sleeves, but it's still too hot for my winter coat. I believe most of them are rated for -10. Combined with a regular hoodie, the T-MAX hoodies are crazy warm for a long while into the winter but NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR A WINTER COAT."

As the business, you will be responsible for all the paperwork relating to your relationship with your customer, just as any other business would be. For example, your customer will not send you any tax documents at the end of the year: you will need to calculate all those things yourself.

Mississauga just has to deal with congestion because transit today isn't a viable option. HOV lanes won't help alleviate congestion. Our transit solution is 30 or more years away but it doesn't lie in connecting Meadowvale to the Airport (and I live in Meadowvale). Transit needs to first connect cities not communities, especially so in the suburbs.  Why there's no mention at all of a third rail line on the Milton GO Transit route I don't know.

I remember seeing this story after I think I was approached by someone with a similar kind of story at the Jack Astor's parking lot  in SQ1. It was only a woman, but around the same age and size but different coloured hair. Her story was that she locked her keys in her car and needed to get to Etobicoke to get home to get to work, but her dad wasn't answering the phone. She had no cell because it was in the car. So I let her use my cell. Naturally no one answered and she then proceeded to ask for cab or Go Bus money. I had no cash on me so she asked if I could use the ATM. I was on my guard a bit but she seemed really genuine and I figured it's only $20, so I'll do it in case she was actually in need. Anyways, I go in to get money, I come back out and she's gone. So I have no idea if it was a scam or not, but I'm assuming she didn't want to go into a public place to be seen and ran her off to try and find her next victim."

One antenna is pointed towards the CN Tower, the other is pointed at Buffalo NY. I have a pretty unobstructed view of the CN tower so the reception is pretty damn good. My Buffalo antenna gets a bit choppy during inclement weather.  Other than when the weather sucks, the images on my tv are crystal clear. The antennas cost me around, $150 for both.  I get 22 digital channels for free including. Some are HD, and others are standard definition. The best was my NBC NY feed. Last year I got to watch the US superbowl feed with the US Ads.  There are a lot of vendors who sell the antennas, and it is completely legal to do this. I went to Canada Computers on Burnhamthorpe west of Mavis, they have a large selection, and receivers if your parents tv's can't handle digital signals.  Best of luck!"

mississauga,2gp9xo,Zerocrossing,2,Fri Sep 19 04:12:39 2014 UTC,"It's because the busses don't have a live connection to the presto network. When you load a fare, the bus has to go back to the depot before it will receive the update.

So for like 15 months you gotta pay 21 a month, which is sort of cheap, but its a one time payment. So you're paying 300+ upfront. The gym is really nice, has all the equipment you need. If the price is too much for you, there's another gym across the street, fit4less. Its much smaller, but costs 10 dollars a month. But if you're trying to lose weight, I'd say that you first lose quite a bit of fat, and then move onto making muscle. But thats up to you."
mississauga,2g5qtn,fdott,1 point,Fri Sep 12 03:54:15 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with you. Preferably I'd like to shave off about 10 or 15 pounds to get to my desired weight. Muscle comes after that.

mississauga,2g48ei,c74,3,Thu Sep 11 17:39:28 2014 UTC,"When it comes to local politics, vote for the one that sounds the most competent and has the most integrity, yes I know you'd be judging a book by it's cover somewhat here. As long as it's not a complete nutjob who doesn't get things done at all or someone who completely opposes your view.  As far as local politics go, you want someone hard-working who will work for the city and is smart enough to get things done even if you don't agree with 100% of their platform."
mississauga,2g48ei,CaptainBloodloss,5,Thu Sep 11 23:13:14 2014 UTC,"nothing sexy or interesting... and not surprising based on the front running candidates.  to be honest, it is so much meh i doubt i will bother to vote.  And i always vote.  Provincially and federally... but doubt it makes any functional difference to me to whichever career politician wins.  Crombie lost her liberal federal seat in 2011 to cpc brad butt so quickly ran for a mississauga municipal seat and won it on name recognition.  Now, she goes for mayor.  If she would have won the federal seat in 2011 she would have smirked at the idea of running for mayor.  This is nothing more than a career politician running for the best job they can whether or not they are really interested.  Then you have Mahoney.  Basically, he got elected provinically,,, then lost so ran federally and won.  ended up losing his federal seat by not getting the nod to run again for office from the libs in 2004 and acted like an ass about it.  But, he was a good liberal for a long time so got a cushy provincial job as the chair of the wsib.  Now mayor???  Sort of funny to think he lost his federal seat to someone of his own party - that's saying something.  No one else has name recognition or connections to create news to have a chance.  So, it's a 2 horse uninspiring race of narcissists."
mississauga,2g48ei,grand_soul,7,Thu Sep 11 22:37:35 2014 UTC,"Well, it appears we have our usual slate of mediocre candidates. If you go to the following link http://www.mississaugavotes.ca/infoforvoters/whosrunning you can see all the candidates running in all the wards and citywide.  If you scroll just the list of those running for Mayor, you can start to see the sorry state we are in. Many of the candidates don't have properly functioning websites. Of those that actually have websites and list their 'platforms' (if you can call them that), almost all of them are void of any concrete plan or reasoning.   Bonnie Crombie and Steven Mahoney are the frontrunners for Mayor, and both come off as bland, uninteresting, and borderline incompetent (this last one is true more so for Crombie). Neither have shown that they have any idea what the major issues are facing the city and how to deal with them (i.e. the budget crisis the city is facing at the moment, thanks to our current inept mayor, Hazel)  So it appears Mississauga is gonna do what Mississauga is gonna do... that is to say, they will elect another completely inept Mayor."
mississauga,2g48ei,CaptainBloodloss,1 point,Thu Sep 11 18:53:20 2014 UTC,What is this budget crisis that our city is facing ?
mississauga,2g48ei,xin000,5,Thu Sep 11 19:00:48 2014 UTC,"Mississauga fill it's coffers via new property development.  This is how the city has avoided raising property taxes for so long.  Thing is, we're starting to reach our limit.  Condo's are a possible life stream, but we're just coming back to old habits."
mississauga,2g48ei,Whatisthischeese,4,Thu Sep 11 19:03:19 2014 UTC,"Yes, basically what grand_soul said.  Hazel basically took property development money, and used it to keep property taxes artificially low (instead of, say, investing the money). But all that money has dried up, and so people in the city are seeing big property tax increases year after year (something like 6-7% a year... look at your property tax bills to see what I mean).  In essence, Hazel ran a giant pyramid scheme for years and years, and now its all coming to an end. The city will need new tax streams (either continued massive property tax increases year after year, or the implementation of some other tax across the city) to fund our budgets.  And my overall point about the candidates for mayor (especially of the 2 front runners, Crombie and Mahoney), is that neither has addressed this problem, and I personally think that both are jerkoffs for not doing so."

Depending on what part of Mississauga you have to run around in, I highly recommend the venue the slam will be at.   It's an open free community space so anyone is welcome all the time. They have lots of games, coffeeshop, computers, books, sketchpads, pretty much anything you'd need to chill out and wait on traffic. If you ever wanna check it out it is called Studio 89 at 1065 Canadian Place. It's closest to Eglinton/Tomken intersection.  We also have coffee meet-ups, networking groups, board game/gamer groups(this Fri at 630 is the next one), and lots of other activities that go on there on a regular basis. Which is why I want to add the slam to the list before they are booked every single day :)"

EDIT: Also, a few people post amazing pictures on here, including my current desktop background."
mississauga,2fzuxw,jc27,7,Wed Sep 10 13:52:17 2014 UTC,"Few reasons.  Mississauga is a bedroom suburb at it's heart. It is changing and maturing, but at the end of the day it's a place for people to sleep, or at least that's how it started. There isn't much civic pride here, and most people are pretty apathetic to the going-ons around the city.  Also, our politics are pretty lame. Up until a few years ago, no one even discussed Hazel and just kept re electing her. That's changed over the past couple years with the development scandal involving her son, the city now having to borrow money, and with Hazel retiring. People might actually care a little bit about civic politics starting this upcoming election.  A big portion of posts in /r/toronto involve transit. Transit is a hot button issue in Toronto, and up until recently was pretty much irrelevant in car-dependent Mississauga. Of course, that is changing with major bus routes at capacity, and with new projects being built/proposed (BRT, LRT). I would expect to see more posts concerning transit coming to /r/mississauga soon.  Overall, Reddit tends to have a younger demographic, and most young people in Mississauga don't really have much interest in the city other then where to eat/drink/party. Which is understandable."

mississauga,2fzuxw,jc27,8,Wed Sep 10 11:56:33 2014 UTC,"Take a look around other city's subbreddits that are suburbs of a major city. Look at Brampton, Hamilton, or Vaughan in the GTA. Look at ones out in BC or Quebec. You can also look at US cities that are suburbs and you'll find the same thing.   Then, take a look at cities that are the major cities in their state/province and you'll find the same thing. Endless debates about transportation and other council-related stuff. My guess is that if Mississauga had any kind of LRT or subway system currently in place, there would be a lot more debate. Right now, Mississauga is the kind of place that young people don't really care about. They're here for school or they are living at home or renting and the overall issues of the city don't really matter to them as they look at it as a temporary place.  This sub also only has 2000 readers. That's really not enough to have an active sub. Remember, 1% of Reddit users are content creaters (and even that is probably generous) That means at most we have 20 people who are creating content for this entire sub. Toronto, in comparison, has 47,000 readers and I even find that slow on non-Ford scandal days.   I'm not sure what you really expect out of a subreddit for a quiet, suburban city, but go ahead and let the rest of us know what's happening in the city."

mississauga,2fwvm7,acamu5,1 point,Tue Sep 9 16:56:49 2014 UTC,"So I guess ncix, tiger, or cc won't do cash discounts? What about those 2 mom and pop shops you mentioned?  Where do you get your parts if you boycotted the cc on burnhamthorpe?"
mississauga,2fwvm7,acamu5,3,Tue Sep 9 17:02:49 2014 UTC,"NCIX, CC and tigerdirect are legit businesses that don't do any sort of tax-evading cash only schemes, AFAIK  i can't really tell you about Jsiri or Liata, as I haven't bought anything there since the early 2000s.  NCIX on mavis would probably be your best bet, but i mean, if CC has the cheapest parts, then you can go there too... i'm not suggesting you boycott them as well.  make a list of stuff, put it on a spreadsheet and fill it out with the prices from each store... sometimes, i'll just buy it all from one place, even if it costs a bit more.. don't like the hassle of driving around to 3 different places"

If you don't like anyhting about your food, they'll gladly fix it. Find yours a little overcooked? New one coming right up.   Both of these are ""chains"" and I'm sure the finest steak conosseurs will chime in with alternatives that I don't know about in the Mississauga area...  Medium rare is generally the way to go with a delicious steak. Medium is acceptable if you're a woman or don't like the sight of bloody meat, but anything higher you might as well just get out some ketchup."

mississauga,2frugw,mattbin,2,Wed Sep 10 03:59:20 2014 UTC,"You know, there's nothing wrong with those chains. (Canyon Creek is another one.) The steaks are good and the prices are fair - well, Ruth's Chris is pretty out there but you're paying extra for all that butter I guess.   What you can't get at a chain is the same experience you'll get at an old style steakhouse. And for me that's part of the charm. You won't see a chain restaurant like La Castile, ever, but that's okay. For $20 you're going to get a decent steak at the Keg and that's fine too. Anyone who faults you for going to a chain restaurant is missing the point, I think.   Oh, and absolutely agree on medium rare. It's where flavour and texture meet and have sex in my mouth. Uh, I should probably phrase that better."
mississauga,2frugw,aaffpp,3,Mon Sep 8 17:17:07 2014 UTC,"I checked out La Castile's menu, and the prices actually seemed reasonable. Definitely one to take a look at -- if you can make a dollar run the same distance at both places, I'd be inclined to try an independent house."
mississauga,2frugw,cykloid,2,Mon Sep 8 19:55:40 2014 UTC,"That's what I find with a lot of the old-timey steakhouses: the prices might be $5 more or so than the Keg, but they're not out of the league at all. It's worth it for me, just for the nice old-school ambiance and the little extras (like feta and olives on the table, house-made salad dressings, etc)."

Zorro's Steakhouse and Topiary's Steak & Seafood. Also try Scorpio or Ruth's Chris. Best bet and value, go to Starsky Foods and buy a good steak. If you are doing it for the first time, cook it on the bbq in a dry frying pan, the British way, with butter.

mississauga,2frugw,mattbin,1 point,Mon Sep 8 23:30:42 2014 UTC,"His first steak? In Mississauga, likely it's for religious reasons. That's somewhat of a big an assumption on my part. If it is, likely a family may also have a 2000-3000 year history. In some homes eating a steak is a radical action. And, yes, if you are say from India and a certain caste, it's enough of an action to be disowned. But, he's a big boy. In the end it's his call. I'm also assuming here /user/acamu5 is a he. May not be. Never the less, it reminds me of the first time I saw a big live lobster. I was thinking yum. The rest of my family as thinking, WTF."

They don't really conform to any of the religion in the tradition sense. My mom is a ""spiritual healer"", and my dad wears a cross. They really only don't eat beef, and they eat vegetarian every monday.   I'm sure they'd be alright with me cooking it at home, but it's a can of worms I don't really want to open. Then again, that's sure as hell not stopping me from having a steak dinner at a friends place.   EDIT: Yeah, the worst that would happen is my parents asking me if I'm an atheist, and my mom telling me that I can choose any religion I like, as long as I'm religious."

mississauga,2frugw,BluShirtGuy,1 point,Mon Sep 8 18:01:47 2014 UTC,Those are top criteria for choosing a steakhouse. You don't want some chipper college student kneeling down to your eye level and trying to upsell you on some $12 glass of crappy Chilean Cabernet. You want an old guy in a tuxedo selling you that steak.   La Castile would be my pick in Mississauga too.

I am actually sitting at the bar after work in one of the restaurants in port credit.  The south side shuffle is one of the biggest events in port credit and Mississauga of the entire year. It sucks that you had to wait in traffic, but it's one day out of the year for a fantastic festival with plenty of talented musicians."
mississauga,2fo9h0,operatar,-3,Sun Sep 7 03:04:20 2014 UTC,"I'm all for street festivals, but the organizers didn't even think about what would happen to the traffic. Where would thy go? What is the best way to get the cars around this. All they did was close the street and that's it. No police officers guiding traffic. The funky turn by the Pump grill. If they stopped pedestrians from crossing on the west side of the intersection the cars would be moving without any problem, but because they were cars could only make it on the yellow. Really? 2-3 cars for every light? There were more people stuck in traffic (Most of which were driving through) then there were on the street. People have to remember that this is the only street to move east and west. the only other bridge is the QEW. Bad organization on the part of the organizers."
mississauga,2fo9h0,operatar,3,Sun Sep 7 14:34:20 2014 UTC,"There actually is usually officers, they might have been called away during the period you were stuck in traffic for. Unfortunate for you.  They are also a lot of them wandering through the crown.   And it is unfortunate that the only other bridge to get across the Credit river is the QEW unless you go up to Dundas. But that doesn't mean that an annual event should be changed.   Honestly though, that turn on Stavebank and Lakeshore is bad regardless of the time of day or whether the road is closed or not."

I wasn't really thinking about myself because i wasn't in a rush. I was thinking about all the people trying to get to where they needed to go. The ones just driving through.   Tell me this. Why did the planners of this highly publicized event not even consider the traffic? All they did was close off a very small and tight section of Lakeshore and expected drivers to fend for themselves. This whole mess with traffic would could have been easily solved and even easier to prevent. Have proper signage and police officers in key locations. Ignore the traffic lights and let the cops move traffic while keeping pedestrians safe from antsy/frustrated drivers.   And don't tell me boohoo. It took 30 min to drive a 500m section of lakeshore. All because some inept people were chosen to organize such an event.   I also thought with the election coming up and all this would be a good topic to have on the Mississauga sub.

mississauga,2fff2g,amazingBRIAN,2,Thu Sep 4 04:53:02 2014 UTC,"Bad luck. But Presto is still the cheapest option, in the long run. You can get yourself a student discount on it straightaway. MiWay and other transit systems offer loyalty discounts for regular riders. MiWay's is admittedly pretty weak (the 13th ride onwards within the same week is free), but it's there. And sometimes the Presto readers in the buses don't work, so the drivers just wave you in when you show the card....  There's also the convenience of the auto-fill option, so you never have to stand in line again for another transit pass. Your time has value too.  Plus there's the ability to pay on multiple transit systems (Go, some parts of TTC, Brampton, etc.).  So all in all, I'd say Presto is still the best option. Sometimes they set up booths at colleges and give out the cards for free. You might be able to get one of those. Or you could just go and buy one, load it with a little balance (say $20), and then straightaway register it and set up the online account and the auto-fill functionality."

mississauga,2fff2g,Amelia87,1 point,Thu Sep 4 20:58:28 2014 UTC,"Student tickets are for all students. You can still use them for going to college. I used them for three years going to sheridan college in Brampton from square one. They can see what tickets you're paying with lol, if anything just check the website or ask at the ticket counter when you're buying. The most that happens is they'll ask for your student ID. Keep your college ID on you whenever you're using your student tickets. I used them even on routes that were unrelated to school, I kept my ID as proof."

Here is a forum thread where others have gone a little more in depth on the gas powered ones.3  The electric ones are covered by the Ministry of Transportation4 and are perfectly legal to use anywhere bicycles are allowed under the same rules as ordinary cyclists, except where by-laws have been passed restricting their use.  According to mississauga.ca5:  ""Only e-bikes weighing 40 kg (88 lbs.) or less are allowed on multi-use trails, in parks and on boulevards.""  But that appears to be the extent of it.  According to the Mississauga Cyclists Handbook6:  ""Power-assisted bicycles (commonly known as e-bikes) are legal to ride on any roadway within Mississauga where conventional bicycles are permitted. Only e-bikes weighing 40 kg (88 lbs) or less are allowed on trails, which is intended to restrict e-bikes that resemble motorized scooters.""  So the scooter style ones may cause issue, if it is too heavy or if the officer does not care to verify if it is in fact over-weight.  *Edited to add excerpt from the handbook"

Take the go train, and make sure that you have student fare selected on your pesto card (it's an option on the pesto website).  Then walk to yonge and Dundas square which will take about 15-20 minutes at the most.  It will cost about 5-6 dollars.  For an extra 50 cents or so you can ride Mississauga transit to Islington and TTC direct to Yonge and Dundas square (Dundas station).

mississauga,2errgs,RAND0M-HER0,5,Wed Sep 10 20:51:23 2014 UTC,"Went to Heart Sushi, it doesn't deserve the high amount if praise I seem to be hearing.  1) They DO NOT TAKE DEBIT! This is absolutely ridiculous in this day and age when people seldom carry cash, and not everyone had Visa. Yes, they took credit cards but not debit  2) We went when they had an 18 top. I get it, eighteen people, you want to be on top of it and all that but my table was ignored completely! I think we wait about ten or fifteen minutes just to get one roll during that time. The service was okay before the table of 18 showed, went to shit after that. They also missed a few things from out order that we had to flag them down for our missing items. I would have thought the computerization of it all would avoid this issue.  3) The iPads are cool and all, but it really compromises service. You have to constantly flag down a server if you need a refill, if you have a question, or if you need anything at all. We also didn't have a designated server, so I never knew who to flag down and it was all very weird  Also because of the iPads, I feel like the service itself lasts longer. My SO and I usually only spend about 45 minutes to an hour at AYCE sushi places, but we were there for almost the full two hours and we didn't order more than usual.   I was also disappointed they used mango sauces on a lot of my favourite rolls instead of that sweet, brown sauce other places usually do (like on the green dragon roll). I know that's a restaurant to restaurant thing, but I really don't like mango and I personally thought the flavours mixed terribly.  Another really goo AYCE Sushi restaurant is Sushi Sushi at Erin Mills and Millcreek. They offer a 10% cash discount on meals, free refills on soda where Heart Sushi does not, and I believe their dinner is $23.99  I personally enjoy Sushi Sushi more than Heart, they have quick service, a little cold but that seems to be the norm for sushi places, great dishes that I think really compare with Heart in terms of quality and flavour.   That's just my two cents, but I think the Debit thing is really important. They have an ATM in there, and I have no idea what the charge is for that machine since I didn't have to use it"

Definitely recommend it. Some of my favourites are the mango tango one (without the garam masal) with the cilantro drizzle and also mixing peperoni, pineapple, and hot peppers. The philly cheese steak one is also very good, but can sometimes be too much meat.   But seriously, you HAVE to try them. At least once. They also were on ""You Gotta Eat Here""."
mississauga,2errgs,ragaragasniff,2,Thu Oct 2 15:37:40 2014 UTC,I've been on the fence to try Mickey's. Mainly because the deep dish prices are expensive. Is it worth it?
mississauga,2errgs,reddevilcanada,2,Thu Nov 27 13:50:59 2014 UTC,"Definitely. Keep in mind that whatever their deep dish medium is (I think large?) has the same amount of toppings and everything as their biggest flat crust pizza.   It's definitely a different kind of pizza than something like Pizza Pizza, and thus the price is different. I think each has it's own unique benefits, but if I had to choose just based alone on taste--Mickey's, all the way."

The quality of meat at Osmows sucks... The best part about Tarboosh? The chicken shawarma is made from white meat! So it's healthy, and bloody tasty. I can vouch for it as I'm a regular there and never been disappointed. And great service too... Located at 3050 Confederation Pkwy, Mississauga, ON L5B 3Z6.  p.s. Make sure you get add the hot sauce to the shawarma, and you can even ask them to add French Fries to it, thus making it Arabic style like they have it in the Gulf...

The only place I've found with authentic shawarma so far is at Al-Quds, the middle eastern grocery store on Hurontario and Central Parkway.

Bibimbap is rice, egg, and assorted veggies served sizzling in a stone bowl. It's really good.   You can also try the beef bone soup, it's a clear beef broth with beef shank, taters, and veggies.   If you are feeling particularly adventurous, give the Korean sausage a try. It's blood sausage (made with pigs blood) and glass noodles inside. It's served with salt. Dip a slice of k-sausage lightly in salt and nom nom nom. Korean sausage is best accompanied with brewskis or Soju. Owl of Minerva, conveniently, sells beer."

We called for a reservation, full name and everything, for 7, only to find out that someone took our table. Turns out, the Hostess only wrote my first name down. When we ordered the first batch of food, which was 3 rolls and 4 handrolls, we only got 2 rolls. When the other roll finally came, it was quickly whisked away again because some other table ordered the same thing too. Then we ordered some of the grilled items and some tempura, but they were soggy and tasted like it was sitting in a heat lamp for too long, and a few of the grilled items were just cold. Also, I had to ask my server 3 times before even getting a refill of water.  IMO, it's best to just go there during Lunch when they open, so that it's not that busy and they can focus on actually serving people rather than seeing how many seats they can fill."

The night I went I got some kind of a chicken flatbread, it was extremely dry and flavorless, I ate about 1/8th of it. The waitress noticed and asked if everything was okay, I hesitantly replied ""ahh not really actually"". She got a manager, she asked if I wanted something else, I said sure, I'll try the poutine, which was really good. However, when the bill came I was still charged for the meal I didn't enjoy and the waitress was no where to be found, so I just paid the bill and left. Emailed them later and manager said that was an oversight on their part and would like to send me a giftcard.. which never came :S   Protip: If you go to the bier market, be wary that the food might suck and you may not get a refund, unless its the poutine, the poutine is good."

The two that my band and I used to frequent were at Cuchullainn's in Streetsville on Tuesdays, and Failte Irish pub (next to square one) on Thursdays.   It's a great way to network, and more importantly it'll get your live sound heard by booking agents and bar owners.   We used this method to get the ball rolling and now we're starting to play both of those venues on a rotation."

Here's our website, All Natural Flavours: www.allnaturalflavoursband.com  We're a cover band, which will get random people off their butts to dance. If you're sticking with just originals, I would recommend learning some cover tunes to throw in your set.   Open mic nights are typically 15 minute slots, starting around 9. You just have to show up with instruments (mics, amps and a kit are provided) and sign yourself up.   Featured sets are available (you play for half an hour), but you would need to clear that with Zaddy, the guy who runs the open mic."

They'll hand you a brochure with their coverage area and pictures of cell towers they've put up to make it look like you lose signal if you're up in Barrie and further.   The reality is I work in Vaughan and if my phone is in my pocket I start roaming. Now I'm not being charged while I roam but I can't send texts or use the internet or make calls while roaming.  I live on the border of sauga and brampton (Malton) and i'm fine for coverage here, if I drive to a friend's place in brampton who lives in a basement apartment then forget it. Roaming and I don't get signal back until I'm halfway home at 410/Steeles.  BUT  It's 35/month for a smart phone and I'm a broke college student. I'd been paying rogers close to 90 a month for a long time so I could get used to the spotty coverage for now. My only concern is if there's no signal when I get back to Humber in a few weeks.

Also, Port Credit is a pretty cool place to visit, walk along Lakeshore Rd. and check out the shops, there are plenty of good places to grab a bite to eat too, may I suggest the greek restaurant Colossus, if you and/or your wife enjoy cheese, order the ""Saganaki"" as an appetizer, you won't regret it ;)"
mississauga,2e4o9g,poopingsnail,4,Thu Aug 21 02:23:12 2014 UTC,"I'm gonna be another person in support of taking the GO Train. Traffic getting to Jays games can be nuts. It will take forever to get out of the lots, and then take forever to get back on the highway. The Port Credit GO lot should have parking available in the late afternoon (might be full until then, but as soon as the early commuters come back around 3-4 you`ll be fine). There's 2 parking lots in case one is full, and if those are full for some reason there's lots of parking in the area. GO Trains on the lakeshore line (ie the line Port Credit is on) run every 30 minutes.  I spent most of my life driving around the GTA and even I wouldn`t want to drive to a Jays game. You can view the schedule here: http://www.gotransit.com/timetables/en/PDF/Timetables/06140814/Table1.pdf  As an added bonus, at some points while on the train you can view the slow traffic on the Gardiner as you zoom by.   Note- you're currently pretty close to Cooksville GO Station, but they only have trains in rush hour.   Union Station is pretty close to the Jays game."

mississauga,2e4o9g,mightyprometheus,3,Thu Aug 21 12:57:21 2014 UTC,"If a short walking distance is the most important factor, then the underground parking lot directly underneath the ballpark is probably where you want to go; you would just need to walk to the elevator and take it up into the venue. The entrance is off Van De Water Crescent. However, it may take a longer time to exit after the game. This is also probably the most expensive option."

I don't have comparison experience, but I felt they did really well at teaching the good driving habits that people need to know like looking ahead rather than just at the road, how to handle skids/slides, etc. I'm sure its possibly taught by every school, but, the instructor has a good way of making sure things stick with you with stories, examples.

mississauga,2dt5od,acamu5,1 point,Sun Aug 17 20:02:31 2014 UTC,Nav Bhatia's Hyundai dealership (corner of Glen Erin Dr and Dundas) has used cars I believe. There's also Woodchester Auto Mall in that same location with other dealerships that may have used cars. There's also a Nissan and Mazda Dealership on Erin Mills Parkway and Battleford Rd.  EDIT: word spelling.
mississauga,2dt5od,RogueViator,2,Sun Aug 17 21:35:22 2014 UTC,"I bought my (used) accent at Nav Bhatia's a few years back, it's been a reliable little thing.  I go somewhere else for servicing though because after a couple services I started to feel taken advantage of at the dealership.  Don't forget to factor in the tax to your final price... it adds up at the point that you're spending thousands of dollars on something.  Also look into insurance if you haven't already."
mississauga,2dt5od,JoanOfArctic,1 point,Mon Aug 18 22:37:17 2014 UTC,"hey thanks for the advice, do you have any tips on browsing for insurance? I've been looking around and the prices have been ridiculous (between $3-4K a year)."
mississauga,2dt5od,JoanOfArctic,1 point,Sat Aug 30 17:54:56 2014 UTC,"Depending on your age and driving history, that's on par with what you'll pay in Mississauga.  Just be glad you don't live in Brampton.  Keep checking around - despite being 25 (at the time) I had no Canadian driving record, which is almost as bad as having a major accident, so my quotes were all around the 5-6k range.  State Farm wanted 7k.  I nearly had a panic attack since I'd already spent all my cash on the effing car.  Anyway, Steve from Wardell Insurance (905-634-5549) found me something around 3.5k which was with Intact.  It's been three years and I check all the companies every year but there hasn't been that much movement in the price.  I'm still just under 3k/year.  The companies all have their own formulas, though, so just because I got my best rate at Intact doesn't mean you'll have the same luck.  A lot of my friends have TD Meloche Monex.  Just set aside an afternoon, get a list of insurance companies and call them all up.  Don't bother with the aggregator sites (like Kanetix), some places have extra discounts (based on where you went to school, where you work) that they can't account for in those.  Better to just call everyone up directly.  And, if you haven't bought the car yet and you're considering a couple different models, ask them for quotes on both cars.  It can vary - safer cars get lower rates, cars favoured by go faster stripes types get higher, etc."

I also used to eat the Costco poutine RELIGIOUSLY (literally, an after church tradition with my parents (how things have changed, today I'm a 6 year vegan and don't get hassled by my parents about attending mass and can be a bit more open about why I think religion has little place in a modern society, but I digress)). Asked about the gravy and was told off the ingredient label that it was  veg based. Hope that helps! Poutinis in Toronto have a vegan poutine on their menu, they use dairy-free cheese on.

Having that is stupid and dangerous.

mississauga,2d45hx,pointman,16,Sun Aug 10 01:58:40 2014 UTC,"What is the point of putting parking next to the bus station if you're not allowed to use it? I'm pretty confused and a little angry.   Are you talking about in the Square One lot? That's private land owned by Square One that they pay tax on, they have no obligation to provide free parking to people not going to the mall (and they can argue that you are taking up spots for their customers).  Yes, it can seem ridiculous because it's a huge lot and not often busy, but to be fair, it's their huge lot. I would try parking not right next to the bus terminal, but a bit further away (with cars that look like they're there for the mall)- you probably won't get a ticket then. I had luck with that when I'd park there when the GO lot was full. Just make sure a security guy doesn't see you.   The GO lot along Centre View drive can be used to park for transit use, but it's not too close to the bus terminal and fills up early."
mississauga,2d45hx,rokob,-13,Sun Aug 10 04:38:49 2014 UTC,"They should have thought of that before putting a bus station there. They shouldn't expect to get the benefit of bus foot traffic without the drawback of car parking traffic, especially when the bus station is essentially in the middle of a parking lot. You have to take the good with the bad. The alternative is that I simply stop using the bus and stop going to square one. I usually stop in the mall to eat on my way home.   Edit: By the way, where is the Go lot on centre view exactly? Wouldn't Go give you a ticket because Miway is a different organization?"
mississauga,2d45hx,rokob,3,Sun Aug 10 14:30:38 2014 UTC,"I don't know where they could have put the bus terminal in the city centre area with a huge public parking lot. The idea is that they want you to take the bus to the terminal. Yes, I know it's not always convenient- I'm not the one who designed Miway (also SQ1 is the easiest place to get to in the city by bus). Not too many transit terminals have parking (especially free parking). In the GTA it seems to be mostly GO train stations, with a few subway stations. Most subway stations don't have any parking, especially the downtown ones.   The GO Lot is the thin lots along centre view near station gate (not playdium or chapters). I'm not sure if they would care, but that's a good point. At Kipling TTC and GO share a lot.  That all being said, most of the time you can probably park in the SQ1 lot as long as you don't make it obvious."
mississauga,2d45hx,rokob,-5,Sun Aug 10 15:24:22 2014 UTC,There is no chance I will take a bus to square one. The commute is already long enough as it is. I would rather just drive downtown.

I didn't want to damage the car or anything, but apparently that was wrong). For my G, I had a very sweet, nice old lady be my tester. I had some classical music on when she entered my car, and spent the entire time during my test talking about Australia and her children. Was a pleasant experience.

I actually went to another driving school before this called Academic Safety Driving School which was incredibly sketchy and the guy never even showed up for my in-car so I just decided to go to Ultimate Driver.

For example, I'm using an HP1020 laserjet where the price of the 'official' HP refills (12A) are about $100 dollars per cartridge. I ordered 3 of the 12A compatible cartridges for around $14.50 (they're cheaper in bulk) and it arrived the day after. I figured that even if they didn't work too well, the total price would still be less than half the cost of the official kind.  Well, the quality isn't as good as the official cartridges and the colour tone is a bit on the light side, but it's still more than good enough for printing non-professional documents."

I got my first job when I was 15 (literally in August, when I was 15) so you're in a similar boat I was.   Don't sell yourself short. Don't say you'll do a job for a low price. Find a reputable employer and try to get a job there and don't work for anybody who offers you less than minimum wage. Employers in even legitimate businesses can be sleazy, and will take advantage of young inexperienced workers. Minimum wage is the literally the minimum you should work for. It's August, and no employer will hire you for a ""summer job"" at this point. It would take ~2 weeks to train you, and then for you to quit two weeks later would be a waste of time and money for your employer. Don't try for just a summer job - get a job for throughout high school. I worked from the summer before 10th grade and still haven't stopped - and you're never gonna stop for the rest of your life so you should start getting prepared for that now. I worked one to two shifts a week at Dominion (now Metro) as a cart boy for about 4 hours each. It only took a few hours out of my week and I managed to have money to save and spend. And SAVE. I had some help from my parents, but because I worked from that age, it's the main reason I managed to graduate from a $10,000 a year post-secondary program debt free. It will get you used to the responsibility and really teach you how to balance your time. If a certain business will accept it this way, drop off a resume IN PERSON and DO NOT BRING YOUR PARENTS IN WITH YOU. Tell your parents you want a job. If they give you a lift to wherever to drop your resume off, for the love of god and all that is holy tell them to stay in the fucking car. I worked at a Blockbuster for 4 years (from when I was 17 til 21) and when some kid brought their parents in to drop a resume off, they basically guaranteed they weren't getting hired. The worst was when a kid brought in a resume and their parent did all the talking. Nothing turns a potential employer off as fast as the phrase ""My son/daughter is looking for a job"". Try to look for a job in fast food or retail. They hire young people all the time. Places like Extreme Pita, McDonalds, Dollarama, Canadian Tire, etc. The jobs suck, but you CAN get hired and you CAN make money.   Go to this Government of Ontario Jobs Link. I did a search for you for the Toronto Region for Student & Youth jobs. Some of them will be totally unrealistic but scroll through and see if there's any place you think you could work. If you have any other questions, I'll be happy to help."
mississauga,2cf3om,mikefightmaster,2,Sat Aug 2 15:29:48 2014 UTC,"I'm in the same boat as OP, and that comment was very helpful and I wanted to thank you for taking the time to share your experiences with your early working days. Just a question, isn't the minimum working age in Ontario 16?"
mississauga,2cf3om,KneeGrowsToes,2,Sat Aug 2 16:15:49 2014 UTC,"No problem. I think I was the first of my high school friends to get a job, and basically since I got that first job, I've only had two months where I was unemployed (laid off from a part time job that wasn't doing well when I was 16). Now I'm 24, I graduated debt free and I operate my own freelance business. In 9 years I've worked literally a fuckload of jobs all throughout high school and post-secondary.  To answer your question, technically there is no 'minimum working age' in Ontario as demonstrated at this link here.   It's only unlawful to make someone under 16 work during school hours or in a few certain industries.   However, it is true that a lot of employers simply won't hire someone under 16 - purely because they don't know if you're mature enough to handle a job (similar to the purely arbitrary drinking age and voting age).   So that's why you need a kick-ass resume and to put on a kick-ass interview. You can make a decent resume with no real working experience - provided you've shown dedication and work ethic towards other aspects of your life (volunteering, consistent training in a field like music or sports, etc).  If you are interested I can dig up the oldest resume I can find (my current resume does not include a lot of these older jobs as it pertains exclusively to the industry I'm working in) as a sample by just changing the personal information on it and PM it to you. I think the oldest one I have hidden in the depths of my computer is from when I was 18 - and this resume got me a lot of part time jobs in various industries (seriously, I worked in restaurants, retail establishments, hotels, grocery stores... I was fucking odd job Jack.)  But just know a resume can only get you an interview, and interviews are a whole other monster you need to tackle."

I am getting a summer job with a contractor family friend for August,  and I turn 16 this November so I think I'll start applying for jobs then.

I have a few questions.    1) I live close to the heartland area, which stores should I be looking to apply in?  2) who should I drop off my resume too? Go in to the cash and ask for a manager? And what should I say to him?  3) what kind of things should I put in my resume other then volunteer work?"
mississauga,2cf3om,mikefightmaster,3,Sun Aug 3 13:34:47 2014 UTC,"Heartland has a ton of stores and restaurants. I'm not quite in that area so I don't know the specifics - but lots of retail and restaurants around there. Ask to talk to a manager when you get in, and mention you're a student looking for part time work to do during the school year. Don't tell them your age if you're not asked. DRESS WELL - you don't need a suit despite you being /u/Suits348 - but wear some nice pants, put on a button up shirt and look decent - it will take you surprisingly far. If you want, PM me your email address and I can send you a template resume of mine from back in '09 (with my personal information erased). It has some employee experience on it but you can see what else I've included."
mississauga,2cf3om,TwistedxRainbow,2,Mon Aug 4 03:55:46 2014 UTC,You should look into applying at grocery stores. They hire a lot of young staff and are usually very flexible with hours going into the school year.
mississauga,2cf3om,RAND0M-HER0,1 point,Sat Aug 2 20:26:31 2014 UTC,"Don't look for a summer job, look for a job that you can continue through high school by working part time. Look into Tim Horton's, McDonald's and grocery stores. I started working at Tim Horton's when I turned 15, and I was there for four years.   My SO worked at a grocery store for five years through and out of high school. When summer rolls around, you can always ask your manager for more hours if you have a part-time position during school."
mississauga,2cf3om,c74,1 point,Sun Aug 3 01:56:49 2014 UTC,"Further to other advice, Cost-co used to pay a lot more for part-time students than other grocery stores.  (This goes back a long time ago... but suspect they are still above average).  The thing is, you should be targeting a 'job' for the most money you can make over your highschool years.  A couple extra bucks an hour over 4 years is a sizeable chunk of change.  Other sensible strategy is to look at busing tables at a restaurant like the keg.  Getting the experience and working up to a waiter/ess is gold if you go to university.  Tips, tips, tips... people do this for 'full time career' and you can make similar money while in school.  best luck."

The price hike was due to Canada's currency being weaker than America's for the past 4-5 years. It's to balance everything and make it so the console isn't so costly.  TL;DR: Every retailer sells the same bundles for the same prices, as dictated by Sony. The Last of Us Remastered bundle is the best bang for your buck currently."

The only manual stuff we do is the final sort, where we read the postal code and place it into an appropriate bin. Not to bring down Canada Post or anything, but sometimes, there are employees who just don't care or, for lack of a better word, really dumb.  I don't want to sound prejudiced or pompous, but the worst offenders are the newer employees who are either new immigrants or almost senior citizens. They just can't seem to keep pace with the machine, and they have trouble using their common sense. It makes for a very chaotic workplace.

mississauga,2c5lxd,peesu,3,Fri Aug 1 00:01:28 2014 UTC,I had a guy ship me a package from niagara falls and when he dropped it off thats the last he has seen it. How is it possible to lose a package? Does it fall off your conveyors at the sorting plant? I just dont understand how my order from china can make it but an order from 100km away cant.
mississauga,2c5lxd,mightyprometheus,1 point,Thu Jul 31 13:55:16 2014 UTC,"The plant itself is huge, as you've seen. I handle parcels, and the way we do things is that we get stuff in huge bins, where we unload each one onto a conveyor belt by the loading bay. There's a machine in the belt where it scans the barcode of the parcel and it automatically redirects it to a portion of the plant for further sorting. The last stage is done by hand, where we take the parcels, look at the postal code and place the package in the appropriately labeled bin. It's then taken away to a loading truck to be delivered to various post offices, and from that, we put it in your mailbox.  If you've sent stuff in bubble mailers or envelopes, they're sorted out by machine, placed on a bin and wheeled away in another area of the plant. I've been there once, and it has cubby holes with labeled postal codes. It was covered in training to alert the supervisor if a package is open/damaged, and to pick up any form of mail/package that's lying around. That's about what I know, in terms of the envelope stuff."

mississauga,2c2l7c,pm_me_n_wecantalk,4,Tue Jul 29 19:40:18 2014 UTC,"Dr. Leny Sferlazza (905-568-4628) at Skymark Dental (Eglinton and Hurontario).  They've never pressured me to get a procedure that wasen't necessary, and when a procedure was necessary, they explained why it was necessary, what they would do, and the alternatives.  They have also recommended other dentists and orthodontists when I wanted to have a second opinion.  They have given me free whitening treatments, and birthday gifts.  They are big community supporters and sponsor cultural and children's initiatives. They let me know about new procedures that the dentist/hygenists are trained in, but have never pressured me into an unnecessary procedure.   They are friendly, accommodating, and available for emergencies.   They will show movies/tv while you are getting your teeth cleaned.  Dr. Sferlazza often tells me about additional qualifications that he (and his staff) receives and conferences that he attends.  They seem to upgrade their equipment fairly often.  The price is fair (cheaper than my husband's dentist who he sees only because its close to our home).  I live downtown, and will travel 90 minutes just to go to the dentist because Dr. Sferlazza treats his patients like family.  Seriously, how many dentists' mothers will drop by their practice with a tray of hot lasagna and serve it to the patients in the waiting room?"

mississauga,2c2l7c,neowie,1 point,Wed Jul 30 07:23:28 2014 UTC,"As I mentioned in my previous post, he charged less than my husband's dentist (we've compared bills for the same procedures (same time and units of cleaning, scaling, etc.) and Dr. Sferlazza charges less than City Dental (though not a lot less).  Best thing is to go in for a consultation and have that discussion with them.  They will work with you to figure out the best course of action for your dental health.  Yes, Dr. Sferlazza will tell you about various procedures he offers (teeth whitening, straightening, cosmetic, etc), but what I've noticed is that when I say I'm happy with my teeth as they are, he doesn't push.  I think in the 10+ years I've been going there he's mentioned whitening 2 times, I got one treatment (it was free, the company offering the product was doing a promotion and it included the mould (mold?) and the treatment for 3 weeks), and while it worked, I'm happy with my teeth actually being tooth coloured (bright white teeth look strange).  Myself, I used to go in every 3 months when I first started because my teeth were in terrible shape and my gums were badly swollen, but now that my dental health has improved I go in every 4 months but I don't think I'll drop to every 6 months because I still have ongoing concerns (sensitive teeth, permanent retainer, slight swollen gums).    I used to go to another dentist that was a horrible experience.  Old equipment, no entertainment, office full of creepy plastic smurfs toys.  I hated going to the dentist when I started going to Sferlazza, and it took some time to get over my fears, but now it's something I actually look forward to.  I literally make sure I have a dentist appointment on my birthday every year so that I can a) take a day off work (cause you know 90 min commute each way takes a chunk out of your day) and b) I love the way just-cleaned teeth feel - soo smooth!

mississauga,2bzrhw,uber_shnitz,2,Mon Jul 28 23:28:47 2014 UTC,"Hey!  Thought I'd come in here, as I was in the same situation a year ago.  Packed up and moved from London, Ontario and did it without a vehicle.  All the doom and gloom re: Miway is total garbage.  They are hyper efficient, offer well laid out routes and many transfer points to other cities' transit.  This area has phenomenal transit options if you know what you're looking for.  I'm a professional logistician, so when I moved here I picked the most efficient spot to use public transit.  I live on Bloor, between Tomken and Dixie.  It takes me 20 minutes on one bus to get to work, 20 minutes on one bus to get to Square One and 25 minutes on one bus to get to Islington Subway station.  It's doable.  I sacrificed amenities, as the building I live in isn't high end, but at $1100 a month it's probably the best I can do.  Location is everything.  I'd suggest a place near Square One if you have the $$$.  It'd be a very easy bus over to work, or in to the city.  To get to Toronto you have a host of options: GO Bus from Square One GO Train from Port Credit Subway from Islington  It's very, very easy to get in and out of the city.  I do it every weekend at least once.  If you're going out drinking though, you'll need a place to crash as the latest you can get out of Toronto is at 2.  Subway stops running at 1:30 as well.  As for fares, I suggest buying a Miway monthly pass for $120 and having a Presto Card.  Having only the Presto Card will cost you an additional $15 a month if you use Miway buses 12 times a week, which if you're doing any kind of work + social life, it's easy to do.  Let me know if you have any questions, I'll try to help in any way I can."
mississauga,2bzrhw,jc27,1 point,Tue Jul 29 13:53:33 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! Still on the fence about bringing my car, but it's nice to have the option.  I'd just like to clear something up, to get to Toronto (either downtown or subway), I would need an additional pass on top of the MiWay monthly or is there a MiWay bus that gets you into Toronto? My understanding is that the GO bus is a separate service and I'd like to avoid having multiple transit passes.  I don't mind not living in a high end building (I'm used to student apartments) as long as it's well located (near groceries, gym/sports, transit, maybe near work) so if you had any recommendations to areas that'd be great!"
mississauga,2bzrhw,HamulcarBarca,1 point,Tue Jul 29 15:57:49 2014 UTC,"Hey so I just moved here as well and have a presto card but for even more savings I should get the Miway monthly pass too?  The ticket person at Sq1 didn't mention shit about the monthly pass, I live close to the Go station to travel around the GTA but this is definitely a driving town."
mississauga,2bzrhw,xsmiley,2,Sat Aug 2 00:18:17 2014 UTC,"mississauga transit is only good at doing one thing... going to SQ1. when i lived in mississauga, i couldn't do anything without using car.  biking is probably an option in your location. matheson is a pretty decent east-west route for bikes and most of the major roads going to your office are relatively quiet (fieldgate, rathburn, etc.)... bonus if you're a cyclist, Midweek cycling club meets right outside your office on Mon-Wed nights.  if you found a place around fieldgate and rathburn, you could probably walk to work, and there are some decent bus options in that neighborhood as well that will take you to a TTC subway station"

You may want to look for apartments in nearby Toronto (Etobicoke) because there are a lot more apartments in Toronto, and you will be paying less for car insurance if your address is in Toronto. The drive from Montreal to Toronto is not that long since it's just a 1 way trip. I strongly recommend a car if you're going to live in Mississauga or close to it."
mississauga,2bzrhw,ClassicBob,2,Tue Jul 29 08:01:34 2014 UTC,All good advice....bring your car if you're gonna be in Mississauga or Etobicoke. The drive to Toronto proper isn't too bad. There's a lot of construction in the Tahoe area and there is no where to walk to for a lunch or a break
mississauga,2bzrhw,dabasegawd,1 point,Tue Jul 29 16:16:17 2014 UTC,Ok cool thanks! Only reason I wasn't sure about Toronto is because I assumed a major city would have difficulty parking (like Montreal) and I don't really love dealing with street parking in general.
mississauga,2bzrhw,dabasegawd,2,Tue Jul 29 11:31:59 2014 UTC,Only downtown Toronto is annoying with parking. But since you work in Mississauga you won't have to live in the downtown core. Most places include parking or have parking spaces at the apartments for fairly cheap.
mississauga,2bzrhw,dabasegawd,1 point,Tue Jul 29 12:52:49 2014 UTC,"If you find a house or apartment, you can park there. I'd say bring your car because it makes life easier going around Mississauga. If you're going downtown Toronto, you can park at the subway end (Islington) and take the subway around.  There's plenty of parking at work, so that's there as well."

While canvassing, I've heard from many residents who are upset about the renaming of Hartsdale Avenue school to Janet I McDougald school. People are upset for one of two reasons:  1) The board went against the wishes of the community, who had spent time consulting with the board to come up with the name, motto, and mascot for the school after the upheaval from South Peel school closings.  2) The renaming is after a sitting trustee, who is eligible for (and is running for) re-election.   There is, of course, more to this election than the school renaming, but I did want to provide some local context to this post.   Edited to add: I have no affiliation with /u/Ulyanov70."

Especially in certain sports like cricket, communication and discussion is vital. Why don't you put yourself in their shoes? Would you 'choose' to be an asshole? No, but sometimes you inadvertently do things that inconvenience other people, it's a natural consequence of living around other humans. Frankly, to have the audacity to put yourself above people who you have absolutely no idea about and say they want to be assholes on purpose when you wouldn't think of yourself like that is simply astounding.  If you go back and read what I said elsewhere in this post, you'll notice that I said he should just talk to them first. He made it seem like he hadn't even considered just approaching them, which is literally the first thing any rational adult does. I never spoke of his rights or that he couldn't file a noise complaint. He could do whatever the fuck he wants, especially if they don't pipe down after he talks to them. However, I chose to give him a piece of advice that would not only save him the trouble of hassling city hall (many phone calls), but likely save the city money (no employee time taken) and the cricket guys trouble as well.  But no, those dudes are assholes so let's punish them, because that's what matters. Not that the issue is resolved in the most efficient way possible, but that they get what they deserve."

I didn't mean it the overall sense of ""culture"" but a narrow part that deals with how to build a reasonable living society and community. As a first generation immigrant I'm quite aware of social customs and norms where I come from and how they compare to Canadian ones.  Also, I meant it more in a context of Canadian multiculturalism where, I think, people take the term too literally; i.e. you can do whatever you want because… it's MY culture.  The way to build on a Canadian tradition is to recognize that - as an immigrant - you and your group are not bringing anything that can be construed as superior to Canadian community culture and for that reason you should examine your behaviour. Or, expect to have it pointed to you.  I'm not pissed - at this point I'm trying to figure out how to solve this.

Your landlord is not legally allowed to withhold it or use any part of it to pay for damages.  I'm not sure exactly when he has to return it to you as usually you would just not pay the last month's rent.  If he wants to try to blame you for the damages he has to make an application to the Landlord tenant board who will decide if and how he's allowed to charge you with the damages.    You can find more info here: Landlord and tenant board

After my current landlord agreed that would be ok, I agreed to the Aug 1st move in date.    Did you sign a 12 month contract when you moved in ?  Did you get your landlords agreement to move out earlier in writing, dated and signed by both of you ?  If you dont have this new agreement in writing, the landlord can easily keep your last month deposit.  As a tenant ive been through the landlord and tenant board hell and trust me when i say, you want to document everything in writing.  moving in ? take pictures of any visible damages and include them in the contract. Found new damages while living there for some time ? type out a letter to the landlord asap. signing and dating everything."

mississauga,2bm21p,DanLynch,1 point,Thu Jul 24 18:17:44 2014 UTC,"It sounds like all the relevant cheques have already been cashed. The landlord would be insane not to have cashed the rent deposit cheque when the tenant first moved in, and the July rent cheque has already been cashed according to the OP.  If there are any other post-dated cheques in the landlord's hands, such as for August and later, then cancelling them is certainly the right thing to do."

mississauga,2b2qjs,acamu5,4,Fri Jul 18 20:19:36 2014 UTC,"I agree. People there seem to know how to use a roundabout and I would say maybe 5% of my experience was negatively impacted by someone not knowing how it worked.  However the roundabout at Canadian Place is just plagued with shitty drivers (cars going left to ""save"" on time/petrol).  The Winnipeg idea is pretty awesome too."
mississauga,2b2qjs,EpsilonSteve,9,Fri Jul 18 21:35:17 2014 UTC,"They are awesome, I've driven on that one and a few more.  North America needs a lot more of them, intersections are very inefficient."
mississauga,2b2qjs,Defiant001,8,Fri Jul 18 20:39:50 2014 UTC,"I think we need to start implementing what Winnipeg has. I went to Winnipeg this summer and loved the traffic lights system at night.  From midnight to 6am most traffic lights for bigger roads blinked yellow as to slow down and yield. For the inner roads connecting to the bigger roads, the traffic lights blinked red as to stop and then proceed.  When there is barely any traffic on Mavis, I hate waiting 2 minutes for a green at the inner roads just to take a left turn."
mississauga,2b2qjs,TrioN123,3,Fri Jul 18 20:55:42 2014 UTC,This is very smart. I've never heard of this before. I wish we saw more traffic improvement initiatives like that in Ontario. Thanks for sharing!

I was impressed with them after a trip to Barbados, where they are everywhere but go in the opposite direction.  There is also one near Picton that I enjoy.  The Square One roundabout is fine and the only one that ever freaked me out was in Paris around the Arc de Triomphe, thankfully I wasn't driving that one."

Quick copy/paste from their site ""Thank you to all of you who came to enjoy the meet. It’s sad to say that a substantial number of people leaving the meet ruined it for everyone. We’re especially disappointed in the number of people standing on the sidewalk encouraging drivers to do burnouts. For this reason there will be NO meet next week! I know majority of you will be angry but you can thank the people who have NO RESPECT for the guys who try to make this possible every week. Peel Regional police issued a lot of tickets to the people leaving. To those that did burnouts, we hope you enjoyed your 15 seconds of fame. Your sideshow has left a bitter taste in the mouths of officers and organizers alike. We’re glad people got pulled over and off the road. Anyone who puts themselves and others in danger deserves to suffer the consequences. To those that constantly begged for the meets to start, here is your Ertefa, which is no longer a reality. This meet was dedicated to Aidan Fleming who passed away in a fatal car accident. Seeing you all burning out leaving the meet reminded me of the pain and suffering we all experienced."""

mississauga,2b02cu,yawaramin,2,Fri Jul 18 03:58:55 2014 UTC,They are not. Compare the nutritional info.
mississauga,2b02cu,Boogilywoo2,4,Fri Jul 18 04:05:26 2014 UTC,"OK, I'll bite (heh).  Let's compare a Big Mac and a standard beef shwarma. The logic being that they're both basically beef sandwiches. Let's do an ounce-for-ounce comparison of nutritional stats. Not a perfect comparison because servings are different so ultimately you'll be eating different amounts, but purely from the data perspective:    Food Michigan Dining Beef Shwarma 1oz Big Mac 1oz Note    Calories 66.00 72.37 Shwarma wins this one   Saturated Fat (g) 1.33 1.32 Almost no difference   Trans Fat (g) 0.33 0.13 Shwarma has slightly more bad fat   Total Fat (g) 4.00 3.82 Surprising   Cholesterol (mg) 21.33 9.87 Ouch.

The cholesterol number looks a little worrying. But on balance, I believe the shwarma is still healthier."
mississauga,2b02cu,yawaramin,0,Fri Jul 18 23:43:57 2014 UTC,You can't compare the nutritional info for something that has variability. No two places make the same burger or shawarma. It's not like weighing 100 grams of granny smith apples or something.
mississauga,2b02cu,pointman,0,Fri Jul 18 19:29:23 2014 UTC,"That's a big generalization. Shawarma can certainly be healthy if you don't go overboard on garlic sauce. If you're getting a plate, you can often just swap out the rice and potatoes for more salads."
