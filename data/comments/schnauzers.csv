schnauzers,3dwj2q,rvadevushka,2,Mon Jul 20 03:04:51 2015 UTC,What number guard did you use on the back?   Any tips/ suggestions?
schnauzers,3dwj2q,abanks47,2,Mon Jul 20 17:08:53 2015 UTC,"I actually use a #10 blade all over with no guard! Learned from my mom, who learned from youtube videos, haha. They don't look pro, exactly, but at $50 per dog for a pro clip, I definitely prefer to do it myself."
schnauzers,3dwj2q,Jubjub0527,2,Mon Jul 20 17:21:58 2015 UTC,Start young. I shave my one girl who hates it and always has. She won't let me do her ears but I can get everything else since I started her young.
schnauzers,3dwj2q,guntherp,-3,Tue Jul 21 00:03:05 2015 UTC,Poor dogs. Look like they were left at a frat party.

schnauzers,3ds5bl,Gkuesmtpo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:55:29 2015 UTC,Was at the groomer and saw this pup getting groomed before my schnauzer.

schnauzers,3dqdgp,deni_an,5,Sat Jul 18 12:59:00 2015 UTC,She cut open the pad above her dew claw and just below it. It's not as bad it looks really.
schnauzers,3dqdgp,Missgonzo666,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:03:38 2015 UTC,Awww get well soon Lily!  She's the same color as my Lucy!
schnauzers,3dnl3t,22percentaccuracy,4,Fri Jul 17 18:56:05 2015 UTC,"Holy crap, those ears! More pics please!"
schnauzers,3dnl3t,0376957,2,Fri Jul 17 19:10:38 2015 UTC,"Such big, floppy ears!  I love the non-clipped schnauzer ears."
schnauzers,3dnl3t,Barbara1Brien,2,Sat Jul 18 12:51:23 2015 UTC,Haha our breeder suggested glue because she's becoming a bit of a donkey but I love it!
schnauzers,3dnl3t,FeedWatcher,3,Sun Jul 19 03:37:17 2015 UTC,OMG I love Toro.  Such a little sweetpea.
schnauzers,3dnl3t,girlfrodo,2,Fri Jul 17 20:27:25 2015 UTC,OMG so adorable! He's gorgeous. Toro is a brilliant name. Love it.

schnauzers,3dje2s,TBTurtles,2,Thu Jul 16 19:17:49 2015 UTC,One of my schnauzers I owned in the 80's had a love/hate relationship with the sprinkler. She'd attack it as it came her way - open her mouth and try to eat it - then she'd whine that she was all wet. LOL
schnauzers,3dez5r,real_red,4,Wed Jul 15 19:18:37 2015 UTC,"Wow, she/he's beautiful. Love the little pink ears!"
schnauzers,3dez5r,myhusbandsgirlfriend,3,Wed Jul 15 22:44:10 2015 UTC,"Awhh, I love your pup's floppy ears!"
schnauzers,3dez5r,Ishus,-5,Fri Jul 17 21:35:07 2015 UTC,Kinda ugly

schnauzers,3d5ubw,AgThunderbird,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:30:32 2015 UTC,What a cutie! I moved countries in March and my boy had to stay there. I miss the sleeping schnauz snoring so much.
schnauzers,3d5ubw,jessisrad,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:07:25 2015 UTC,She is beautiful!

schnauzers,3d3fym,rannee1602,2,Mon Jul 13 05:26:08 2015 UTC,He looks sooo much like my baby when he's all groomed up!
schnauzers,3d3fym,Teal27,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:10:55 2015 UTC,It's amazing how alike some schnauzers look! I've seen some schnauzers on instagram that look very similar to mine too.  You'll have to post a picture of yours!
schnauzers,3d3fym,Teal27,2,Mon Jul 13 20:49:31 2015 UTC,http://imgur.com/akBeFVP  I was able to dig up this photo from a while back. I was determined to show you this one because it best demonstrates their resemblance!
schnauzers,3d1t50,pinetar321,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:52:32 2015 UTC,Piper looks good in the morning.  My Buzz has a terrible case of bed head in the morning.

schnauzers,3cinie,real_red,2,Wed Jul 8 07:26:52 2015 UTC,"Awe they look just alike, but yours has the whole tail! My girlfriend is going to fall in love with your dog. Go team mini!"
schnauzers,3cinie,real_red,2,Wed Jul 8 07:39:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah tail docking & ear cropping are illegal in the UK which i'm glad about because they are so expressive with both. I had a quick look through your posts & we have a glasses pic too, just uploaded to link it https://instagram.com/p/44QVrarOtN/  Whites are quite rare over here, they were only accepted as an official colour a couple of years ago, white mini schnauzer fact 1 lol"
schnauzers,3cbzdl,laycas49,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:55:40 2015 UTC,Maybe that creeper goose will play with her :)
schnauzers,3c0dcx,raggilu,3,Fri Jul 3 16:54:46 2015 UTC,Awesome! Cherish every hike with your little buddy.  Mine are 11 years old now and no longer have the endurance for hikes. It's mostly just walks or giving them 20-30 mins of off leash time in the field near my parents' place.
