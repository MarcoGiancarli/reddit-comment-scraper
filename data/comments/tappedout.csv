tappedout,3e3lqb,athrowawaynic,2,Tue Jul 21 20:00:00 2015 UTC,I prefer if the characters have more tasks that you can see them doing something instead of disappearing in the buildings.  Like I rarely get to see Stumpy because he just hangs out 24/7 indoors.
tappedout,3e3lqb,TimYoung,2,Tue Jul 21 18:53:41 2015 UTC,"12-hour with Bart.  He's just a bad character. He needs more tasks. An hour one, for instance. ""Eat peanuts"" at Moe's, anyone?"
tappedout,3e3lqb,azoolie,2,Tue Jul 21 19:24:45 2015 UTC,"Yea, very hard to ever get him free when Bart is free especially I play every four hours so just wasting Barts cash flow if I had to put him on 12 hours task.  And as soon as Bart get some other quest, Stumpy would be standing around twiddling his thumb waiting for Bart to finish.  I really like the look of him but his limited task means I never see him.  Yea he needs new tasks."

tappedout,3e0mz6,Tomahawk92,10,Tue Jul 21 01:19:55 2015 UTC,It's because the player has sent all of those characters on a task at the stadium.  Tapped Out releases the characters for you so you have characters to tap on.

tappedout,3e0mz6,lexabear,7,Tue Jul 21 05:02:24 2015 UTC,"This started during Valentines Day 2014 IIRC. Before that, characters in inside tasks would stay inside. However, the Valentines event required you to tap on friends' characters, so they changed it so inside characters would go outside from wherever they were and walk around. Now it's quite dramatic whenever there's a quest the whole town can do since they all spill out like that."

It made the design looked really good when you have characters animations in the designs.  So it got me thinking what other designs can you incorporate characters tasks in them?  From the top of my head I can only think of Ken Brockman laying on the lawn chair and Homer in his paddling pool that could be used.  Anybody else?

tappedout,3dy95g,Apple15Pie,5,Mon Jul 20 14:49:50 2015 UTC,"Very very nice!  Your stadium is the first one I have seen on here that I like.  Why?  Because you have goalposts!  For some reason every stadium pic posted on here so far does not include goalposts.  You are the first one!  Congrats.  Maybe people think of baseball instead of football.  Also, the use of the double bleachers in front of the homertron as very nice touch.  But!  Goalposts are supposed to be opposite from each other.  You have them right angle.  Drop one of them and replace with a bench and it will be perfect.  Also, a minor point is that I would move the stadium entrance to line up with the stadium fences because they click together whereas right now it doesnt look as smooth.    Anyway, well done!  I wish I could afford so many bleachers to make a bigger stadium."
tappedout,3dy95g,TimYoung,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:02:00 2015 UTC,"You kept saying ""football"" so I looked for the goalposts but couldn't find them. All I saw was soccer nets.

tappedout,3dy95g,azoolie,2,Mon Jul 20 21:54:28 2015 UTC,"In UK, soccer = football and football = handegg (not really, its called American football.  :P)  There are goalposts for both if you have a look.  Saying that I don't understand why there is because it is a football pitch rather than handegg pitch so it would look weird having handegg posts instead of goalposts.  I mean if we were given a handegg pitch, I would put in handegg posts."
tappedout,3dy95g,TimYoung,-1,Mon Jul 20 23:26:28 2015 UTC,"This definitely isnt a football pitch. Its not like any pitches i can think of, apart from rounders or baseball - more square pitches"
tappedout,3dy95g,TimYoung,2,Tue Jul 21 01:21:07 2015 UTC,Is a football pitch mate.  It has the kick off centre circle and the four corner flags area.  The only thing is that it has two crisscross halfway lines and I think that is more to do with the fact that it allows you to place the goals diagonally either way.  Same why it is a square rather than rectangle.
tappedout,3dy95g,TimYoung,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:31:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the praise :D   I know that the goal posts are supposed to be opposite, but I had already bought 2 football nets (soccer) and 2 football posts (handegg), and I won't be able to see one of the soccer nets if i put it opposite the other one. This way i can just about see the handegg posts over the bleachers so it was a decent compromise...  I just pretend that homer made some rule that the posts should go next to each other :P  The entrance is only 5 little squares long, so i cant quite get it to fit with the fences :(  Also, i used /r/freedonuts to have more than enough donuts to build whatever i wanted, check them out ;)"

The problem is I think if I go down that route, I would buy up all the buildings and find I have nothing to do and quit the game.  At the moment really enjoy playing it.  If there were a time I get super frustrated with the pace of the game I might look into it.  Right now the pace is just right for me.

What would you have preferred?"
tappedout,3ds0fj,Dove_of_Doom,16,Sat Jul 18 22:20:37 2015 UTC,"Fair enough; I could at least be constructively critical!  More interesting buildings for one thing.  Characters would have been nice.  Even non playable characters.  Or skins.  The first time they did community prizes was during a halloween event, and the final prize was King Homer climbing a skyscraper.  That was a prize worth grinding for."
tappedout,3ds0fj,Dove_of_Doom,20,Sat Jul 18 22:50:27 2015 UTC,"And as it turned out, the Skyscraper with King Homer is a prize I was disappointed with. I generally prefer more buildings to characters, but I don't like that one. We all have different aspects of the game we like best.  The Springfield Arms isn't all that interesting, but it fits nicely in a crummy section of town. The Duff tanker goes well with Duff Stadium or the brewery. I think the Gridiron is a great prize. Its neon sign is always animated, and it has a unique shape that makes it one of the few buildings that works as a corner piece.  This event didn't bring many new characters compared to most others, though. Just Springy and that horse, and he was a premium. I can see how that would be disappointing."

I haven't bought the most recently released top row yet, and a couple of those squares are 149k. The right-most side, though, ranges from 200k to 900k, and there's one near the top-right corner, but not even on the last row of the top OR side (I don't see those prices yet because I haven't bought the adjacent squares) is 750k.

It was $1.2 million when it first came out, but it is now at the low, low price of $630k!    How much money are you earning per day?  What is your bonus multiplier percentage thing at?  The higher that is, the easier it is to accumulate cash."
tappedout,3dnc4k,TheOpus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:00:37 2015 UTC,"I'd like to stop leveling up but I keep getting XP points.  The buildings went from $150K for Ah Fudge to $200K for that tiny Vulgari building, another $200K for Itchy and Scratchy and then $264K for Honest John's.  I found the trend interesting.  I'm pulling in maybe $75K/day (I think) so Honest John's is about 4 days of grinding for me.    At $630K that's still over twice as many taps as $264K.  So even if I double my daily income I still have to tap to get all of it.  Tapped Out is an appropriate name for this game.  I decided to chill out and tithe to Mr. Burn's big pile of money and wait awhile for Honest John's.   This game seems more of a marathon.

You're assuming they haven't already sold off the game rights to someone else for some kind of tie-in with the new series, or that they had them in the first place (there have been X-Files games in the past, and without knowing the terms of those contracts...). Also, that they'd be okay with the X-Files appearing in this game for a potentially lengthy period, or that they wouldn't have to split the profits.  Even if they haven't, Fox hasn't ever used the game to promote anything else beyond the Simpsons, and the Futurama tie-in was minimal when they had the chance.

You license rights. Otherwise you lose basically all profit potential. Fox would be ""splitting profits"" with itself.   There's no reason it couldn't happen, especially since Mulder and Scully have appeared in the Simpsons show. It wouldn't even be that farfetched. An entire X-Files event would even be pretty cool. They could bring in Kang and Kodos for those who don't have them and they could bring back Number 51 from the Stonecutters event. I can't think of any other aliens from the show off the top of my head so if they did it it would likely be a mini-event, but unless you can show some concrete evidence there are no legal obstacles that would prevent this from happening"

If you rent the movie ""Slums of Beverly Hills,"" they talk quite a bit about the 'dingbat.' Those buildings were very popular in the 1970s and there still are tons around.  To me, the different wall colors stand out (when combined, which I can't ignore.) And I liked their ode to the trashy dingbat building (so I prefer it as is.) I like the gritty neighborhood stuff. I'm almost in danger of my slummy area becoming too big if I let it. I try to keep my towns balanced though.  Thanks for being magnanimous :)"
tappedout,3di4h4,Dinkytinkytoo,2,Fri Jul 17 01:05:07 2015 UTC,"some of the best designs I have seen are where similar theme buildings are put into a block surrounded by square/rectangle road/rivers.  If you look at this thread here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/tappedout/comments/3dajpl/showcase_your_friends_designs/  Particularly Kamp krusty, burns manor and Stonecutters, they really work well together.  But Springfield arms decrepit look, doesn't really go well with other items.  Maybe it goes with testotosezone and dust carts.  Like I think even Muntz and tire Yard is not the same level of worn down look.  Why at the moment, I have mine next to the campfires as kinda like a wilderness pub for travellers.  Was thinking either putting kamp krusty near it when I can afford it or put duff brewery near it as the industrial sector pub."
tappedout,3di4h4,Angryd4d,3,Thu Jul 16 18:18:43 2015 UTC,I just have my SA across from the track.  This type of building is called a dingbat. It's a type typical to parts of Southern California. It's a classic. It's not meant to be larger like a more modern apartment building.  The slum area can be more fun to build than any other part of town.

And those people that spend $500 on a game like this,  well good for them, I am happy that they are so wealthy , but I call them crazy.  I would rather pay $50 , and donate $450 to welfare  if i had that kind of money to throw at leisure activities like a phone game."
tappedout,3dfewj,BurnedOut_ITGuy,2,Thu Jul 16 08:19:03 2015 UTC,They reason they have this revenue model is because of piracy though.
tappedout,3dfewj,vaarsuv1us,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:38:12 2015 UTC,and the piracy (partly) is here because they have this business model.....
tappedout,3dfewj,BurnedOut_ITGuy,2,Thu Jul 16 17:59:38 2015 UTC,But they have that business model in the first place because of the piracy.  The reason they don't just let you pay $X and get the whole game is because of piracy.  They don't make money that way because people just steal the game.
tappedout,3dfewj,vaarsuv1us,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:34:21 2015 UTC,"it's not that black and white.  They could for example charge less for the premium items and keep this model (but cheaper)  instead of charging an x amount for a full game.    Many people turn to hacks because it's just too expensive for people with an average budget.  I am an example.  I play (and pay for) games for 20 years. I think €30-€60 is an ok price.  The last game I bought is the Witcher 3 (€60)   This is a quality game, well worth the money.  Tapped out also has quality, in a total different genre, but that doesn;t matter.  I rate tapped out as a quality game, but only including a large share of the premium stuff.  But that is 'worth' (perception)  also around €50  and not hundreds and hundreds of euros...  The fact that there ARE people who (sometimes subconsciousnessly)  paid €400 euros over the years doesn't change that.  most of them wouldn't pay that much for a phone game if you asked them beforehand, but they got sucked into it. a phone game just doesn't feel like $500 value...   If $50 worth of donuts bought me  a year of premium content I wouldn't turn to our freethinkin sister reddit, but since it doesn't I did, and I don't feel guilty about it at all."
tappedout,3dfewj,BurnedOut_ITGuy,2,Thu Jul 16 20:07:31 2015 UTC,"You're not wrong, but you're not right either.  The reason such a business model exists in the first place is because of piracy.  Devs simply can't make a living selling a a game for X price.  The reason you see devs churn out a crappy game and then nickel and dime you on the DLC is because if they don't, they don't make money.  They could charge less for the content, but again, they have to factor in that it's gonna get pirated as well.  They factor in some loss and add in extra."
tappedout,3dfewj,vaarsuv1us,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:59:57 2015 UTC,"Piracy is not 'in the first place.'  Piracy is as old as commercial software , yet that industry is bigger than hollywood , in other words: it is thriving.  the freemium model exists in the first place because marketing research shows that it is the best option to maximize your profits.    If you think they would abandon freemium if (in some magical way) piracy had totally disappeared , you are wrong.  It would still be the #1 choice because it would give the highest earnings."
tappedout,3dfewj,shortsxit,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:10:57 2015 UTC,"If you perceive something isn't worth the price, then you don't buy it. People turn to piracy simply because it is such an easy way to get what you want. If you were talking about a car that you perceived wasn't worth a certain price, do you give them whatever price you think it's worth and just drive away; or better yet, just steal the car because you think it's too expensive?"
tappedout,3dfewj,vaarsuv1us,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:10:54 2015 UTC,"you cannot compare physical goods with digital goods because of the free copying aspect of digital goods.  making a 2nd car costs just as much extra as making the 1st or the 500000th  (for a give production run) while making a 2nd or 50,000,000th donut cost nothing extra.

tappedout,3d9wu7,TimYoung,8,Tue Jul 14 17:16:55 2015 UTC,So what's the point of having these goals if they're just randomly changing?
tappedout,3d9wu7,Jacsmalls,9,Tue Jul 14 18:09:08 2015 UTC,"It's not like the counter is real either, it just ticks up at a predetermined rate so everyone gets the prizes."
tappedout,3d9wu7,chejrw,10,Tue Jul 14 18:22:01 2015 UTC,"The amount of effort required to not only track and calculate the actual number in real time but send it to everyone playing the game would be MASSIVE, and a huge waste of resources. Expecting that on a mobile game, especially when people pay for their data, is not realistic at all. The counter is a good enough approximation for the end users."
tappedout,3d9wu7,imdwalrus,2,Tue Jul 14 18:31:25 2015 UTC,"I think it's just a base rate that always ticks over. I believe that actual balls still count on top of that as well... I just think their system of ball drops/collection is broken.  I've collected 2 or 3 the whole event, always kept an eye out for them. Have had plenty of notifications that someone has dropped a ball only to not find one."
tappedout,3d9wu7,reddit_somewhere,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:50:24 2015 UTC,"The predetermined rate is necessary because the alternative is that your device would have to constantly reconnect with the servers and re-sync, which their servers couldn't handle, which your device wouldn't do well with, and which would likely cost money to a lot of people, depending on their data plan.  The only upside is that the counter would be 100% accurate instead of approximately accurate.  Further, I haven't checked the counter in this specific iteration, but previously, it was always likely that the counter actually was accurate upon syncing.  The evidence was, if you left your device connected for an hour, checked the count, and then re-synced, the count would always be significantly off.  This proves that the sync-count on their database is different from the approximate count that the game provides in real-time.  But since the approximate count is just a predetermined uptick, why would they bother having two different values unless one of them (the one that actually comes directly from their servers) was accurate?  Nobody has ever been able to explain why EA would have two different false numbers rather than one uniform false number, so I still believe the number is most likely real."
tappedout,3d9wu7,thatguamguy,3,Wed Jul 15 17:47:12 2015 UTC,"The point is EA want you to buy balls.  The change isnt random.  It was just that because it was so high and unobtainable before, no one wanted to buy any balls so they lowered the target.  Now that they have lowered it, it might encourage more people to buy balls.  Personally tho as a freemium player I need all the bucks I can get so, only ever bought one ball to complete the quest."

In a large town there's a zillion places for it to hide.  The balls cost too much to give away.  Can't find them to give them back.  When you do find them they don't go back to sender.  Prize totals are laughably high.

The main thing I got was another goalpost.  It just looks weird having only one goalpost on the pitch.  For some reason, out of my 100 friends, I have only one friend with two goalposts.  Maybe most players are Americans and don't watch football.  It seems really strange for a football pitch with no or just one goalpost.  The thing is the set up of the stadium fits perfectly with lights in the corners and either three bleachers on one side, or two bleachers and a goalpost.  The only thing out of place is the depth of the triple bleachers are one space wider than double and single bleachers so the stadium can be set to be totally symmetrical."

So what... do you have to play every day, 7 times a day to get everything?  That's fine.. but I'm not even getting halfway through this event.   Plus, because of a glitch in a game that was corrected after an update, I wasn't able to play the game for the first week of the event, so that put me back.    Unfortunately, I haven't been able to get any additional characters either.  So I can't play that many tap ball games a day."

I doubt they take up much room on the servers, and EA wouldn't want to risk old players coming back and getting annoyed.   I saw a Santa in someone's town.

tappedout,3d4xds,fingaz1856,6,Mon Jul 13 20:44:04 2015 UTC,"I understand your interest level, but I don't think the prizes are hard to win. Most people are saying it's easier than the last event.  For how bowling competes against lunges... it doesn't make sense...and that's the point. It's a dumb game made by dumb Homer and that's how it's supposed to be. Absurdist. *shrug*"
tappedout,3d4xds,azoolie,5,Mon Jul 13 20:59:38 2015 UTC,"Most people are saying it's easier than the last event.   It's definitely easier.

tappedout,3d4xds,fingaz1856,5,Tue Jul 14 14:52:27 2015 UTC,"They're not, actually. I'm bad at this and I'm keeping up. Secret is to play games at least once a day for the bonus, and to have everyone work for amateur bucks as much as they can.  Edit: about tiring of the game animations, just hit the thing twice and it skips it."
tappedout,3d4xds,Dinkytinkytoo,3,Mon Jul 13 23:35:24 2015 UTC,"The event is meh, but I've piled up the bonus donuts with minimal effort. And it's not actively annoying like the Terwilligers was. None of the craftables are super appealing, so I don't feel the need to make sure I have characters earning currency all the time."

tappedout,3d4xds,Juz-10,5,Mon Jul 13 18:39:24 2015 UTC,"I got it early with a mod. Unlike the skins for the stadium pieces, the dirt field can't be switched with the grass field because when you tap the field, it brings up the event menu. I think it will only be made available after the event is over and it can be used properly."
tappedout,3d4xds,Dove_of_Doom,3,Mon Jul 13 20:07:43 2015 UTC,Possibly the latter.

A lot of events since Stonecutters, starting with Halloween, used a ""crafting"" approach to winning prizes, whereby you collect multiple resources/currencies and decide how to spend them on the prizes, and sometimes also on upgrades to resource-earning tasks/special buildings. Sometimes requires a bit of math/strategizing if you want all the prizes.  This is present in the Tap Ball event in its simplest form yet -- collect only one currency for acquiring items and/or upgrading players. Not sure whether they keep simplifying it in response to player requests, or if they think the concept is stale and are phasing it out."

You earned coins to spin, and could get 3 just by visiting all neighbors daily (this was before you earned less currency after visiting X number of neighbors), plus through actions and event buildings. And rather than duplicates, once you earned a prize, it's place on the wheel was replaced with either a new prize or cash/event currency to earn more spins.   It wasn't great but it wasn't as awful as all those fences. And having to spin the wheel to hope to get currency to spin the gold wheel that might just give you more fences."

This year started slow but then went strong with Superheroes (4 phases, also had crafting), Terwillgers (3 phases, also had crafting) and currently Tap Ball (also 3 phases, and crafting is back but simplified).

We've had awesome community prizes for almost all of the events since I started playing about 2 years ago so I'm not sure why they've missed the mark so much this time around.
