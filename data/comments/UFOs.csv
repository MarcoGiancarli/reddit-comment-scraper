People feel they are very important in the universe and that others would naturally come here to help you and to give you what you wanted and needed. People think contact is kind of a thrilling adventure, a holiday from the mundanity of human life. They want to think that this contact would be very positive and beneficial because they do not have the strength, the courage or the preparation to consider it in any other way.... Look at the history of intervention in your world. Look how easily native peoples succumbed to the presence of foreign intervention. This must not be your fate.""

Basically it has a masterlist of a good percentage of ufo researchers/websites/organizations.  Then it breaks it down simply into a Boolean field of Quack vs Fact or something.    Then scrutinize each and every organization you look at.  I'll try to revisit this subreddit and show you the website im talking about.  And just an idea of howmany % of people are considered ""Quack"" and not trustworthy is like....  Out of 100 people I saw on the list...5-6 made it to the Fact list...for example:  Stanton Friedman was on there Richard Dolan I think Michael Schrutter (spelling)  and mabey 3 other people like  Jacques Vallee  I mean its a very strict list.

Jan Aldrich’s excellent Project 1947 website states that:  [quote] …Gross manages to skillfully balance his presentation, treading through the material carefully and with purpose, as one might negotiate a mine field   The History series is not just a chronological ordering of events. At times Loren includes minute by minute accounts of events, detailing the actions and reactions of military, official and scientific bodies, as well as the culture of popular journalism to the mystery of the unidentified flying object.  [/quote]  Most of these booklets were sent by Loren Gross to a very select circulation list of UFO researchers and have rarely been sold. When I refer to these booklet as “RARE”, well, I really mean that. I’m not sure that a single person here in England qualified for the select circulation list for his series of booklets… Although (as some of you may have noticed!) I have accumulated quite a lot of UFO material over the years, until recently I had only managed to obtain a small handful of those valuable booklets."

I think once in a while debris from previous planets flows by and occasionally tiny specs from those events find us. I think once in a while some survives entry. I think we are the proof, it'll just take a while to prove that, we need more samples. Some are under review currently, and we've had candidates before. I'm not going to be shocked when it turns out we won't solve our origins entirely here. Primary evolutionary grounds? Yep, think so. But I think there may be help from essentially space algae, space tardigrades, or some radiation event that changed primary chirality of organic material naturally evolving in complex extreme conditions already on earth.

Personal experiences and sightings are all we have to go on, and for some that equates to ""belief-in"" or ""debunking-of,"" but it doesn't have to.  The keen and rational mind will of course note that nothing about these phenomena need depend on belief, or rely on debunking, but to simply admit that something truly anomalous is happening and people are reporting it.  That simple fact represents enough of a mystery for anyone to keep interest in the subject, for as long as one is willing to put up with the vast amount of explainable dross that does exist here, and in the UFOlogical world in general.

UFOs,3dyezs,whatthefuckdoiknow,6,Mon Jul 20 17:59:08 2015 UTC,"He probably changed his mind but this is what he said: ""If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn't turn out well for the Native Americans,"" he said. ""We only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldn't want to meet."" In the new program, ""Into the Universe with Stephen Hawking,"" he speculated that aliens' capabilities ""would be only limited by how much power they could harness and control, and that could be far more than we might first imagine.""  ""Such advanced aliens would perhaps become nomads, looking to conquer and colonize whatever planets they can reach"" If anything it will be War of the Worlds...  )"
UFOs,3dyezs,whatthefuckdoiknow,3,Mon Jul 20 18:30:44 2015 UTC,Thank you. That was the quote I was thinking of. I don't agree that the outcome would be that negative. Perhaps he did change his mind.
UFOs,3dyezs,ThePurpleHayes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:35:41 2015 UTC,"I think Hawking is more for the argument that based on human history and the only example of intelligent life we have (us), it seems likely that something along the lines of a Columbus event would happen. On the other hand, if an alien species is advanced enough to travel here then their ethics/philosophy may be just as advanced as their space tech. I think it depends on several factors such as how advanced the alien species is (how easy is it for them to travel in space) and how their civilization is doing at the time of contact."

UFOs,3dzsv9,cloudxen,10,Mon Jul 20 21:24:34 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering if people who are looking to be convinced are just that, curious onlookers with an on the fence predisposition. Why are you looking in to this subject, pure curiosity? Do you have anything to tell us about an experience you had? Someone told me once that once you make a decision about anything, you've simply given up on creative thinking (It's OK to make decisions, just leave the door open). About once every week or so, someone posts here with the same intent as you, and they always get the same answers.  Someone will get pissy and copy all the links about what they deem is proof!  Someone will tell you simply ""There is no proof, or the type of proof you seek.""  Someone will tell you about their own experience.  The bottom line: This universe we live in could range from anything from solipsism to atoms being alive, so what we understand about our terrarium could be far from the real truth. I can't try to convince you of anything but what I truly understand: Eat, Sleep, pay Taxes, and always in hot pursuit of happiness!  Just keep your eyes, ears, and mind open at all times!"
UFOs,3dzsv9,velezaraptor,14,Mon Jul 20 21:47:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly i just look at religion. Most of the major religions all circle the same idea. Someone or something flies down from the sky, tells people how to live and or helps them, then flies off only to make occaisonal visits.  If you were to somehow time travel in an F-22 and land it in biblical times, get out wearing a full pilots flightsuit and helmet, set up a small pot, pull your side arm and shoot the pot, get back in your F-22 and take off, what would be written by a group of people that saw this? What if you had a portable dvd player and showed them a movie? How would they convey what they saw with only the knowledge of what exists at that time?  I imagine it would resemble a lot of stories from a couple different holy books. Especially if you came down and helped with something that, by todays standards would be considered menial or trivial, but back then was a serious problem."

UFOs,3dzsv9,MahSelectah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:54:42 2015 UTC,"As someone from a moderate religious background, I really like your original point in this post.  I thought that I would (just for the sake of discussion) throw out a few points to consider and debate.    In my limited knowledge, living by faith doesn't exactly give us the ammunition to debate the points you have raised.  Who wrote the Bible?  Well, men did, who supposedly under the divine influence of God dictated the stories and made up a collection of 'holy' writings.  Divinely influenced or not, they were still men of their time and (exactly as you described) could not possibly understand 'miracles' and other happenings that they were seeing or being told about.    We are taught that faith alone trumps everything else.  I think that this part alone is the most difficult part for any thinking person.  It is hard to see actual evidence that may contradict our belief, yet rely only on faith that our beliefs are, in fact, correct.  The shame is that, like /u/revoman eluded to, too many of those that live by faith alone are left looking pretty weak in that they deny some simply truths because 'faith', when in fact with some consideration, faith and fact can compliment each other.    It is a fascinating conversation - are some of the biblical stories actually about visitors from somewhere else as you say?  They certainly could be, but too many of faith will simply reject that as sacrilege.  However, there are those who do not and who are very open to that (myself included).  Sadly, we may never know for sure; at least certainly not in our lifetimes.  But consider a variation of what you said.  We may one day be in the position where we land on a planet as explorers, encounter some living and intelligent race that by our standards are primitive.  I am sure that fascinating stories would be told for countless generations, just like they have been here.  Great ideas!"

Apologies in advance and please feel free to downvote at will! I'll accept them all. I can't guarantee any of what follows will make any sense. Ahem...  Proof that aliens have been to earth doesn't exist from my point of view. There are a few testimonies from various credible sources that I shovel some stock into, but I don't necessairly count them as proof, only as support for my belief somewhat educated guess that aliens (not necessarily ""space"" aliens) have been here. However, given how odd the universe is and how limited our perspective capacity is to truly access it and understand it, I tend to think that far, far, far stranger things have happened than aliens visiting earth. And we're not only unaware of these strange things, we can't even begin to dream what these strange things might be. Aliens visiting earth might be mundane compared to what we can't even fathom.  We have five senses. We augment these to varying degrees with technology, but what if we (or something) had 6 senses...or 7...or 10...or 20? Yes, this hints at something akin to hyperdimensionality. All I'm saying is that we currently encapsulate and insulate ourselves within our own physical limitations and through that window judge ""reality"". Just because an alien hasn't walked up and shook my hand, doesn't mean that one hasn't been here or is. A being capable of more than 5 senses could easily hide their presence from us. Hell, they might not even have to hide, or even have that motivation, because we would simply be unable to detect it in any definitive way.  TL;DR: We comprehend the universe through a limited lens...so why assume we see everything.  End transmission..."

It's not like its even a small amount that we can't account for, its 95%.  So currently all the stars, planets, cosmic dust and everything we can detect is only a twentieth of what's really out there, with the remainder labelled 'dark matter' and 'dark energy'. Were nowhere near even understanding what that is and there are just a few vague theories, which is pretty humbling."

UFOs,3dzsv9,ArmedShadowfox,4,Tue Jul 21 05:27:20 2015 UTC,"Testimony from a few high up politicians I've seen was pretty convincing but in terms of convincing physical evidence there's very little that couldn't be explained by human trickery, mistaken interpretation of a different phenomenon, wishful thinking or cultural influences.  I've gone from being pretty convinced of the validity of stuff like Roswell and Rendlesham to thinking they are just Chinese whisper events that have grown out of very little.  Today's CGI technology makes it fairly easy to fake convincing footage - I know because I've worked in graphic design and multimedia for my whole career.  The possibility that there is life elsewhere and some of it being intelligent is not hard for me to accept logically. Also logically if it is coming here - which is exactly what we would do if we had the chance to study an alien culture - is there an agenda to suppress public knowledge of it? It really could cause a great deal of upset and unrest and I think that situation is well demonstrated by the often hysterical unwillingness to look at the subject objectively by most people.  The other question is, who are the aliens, what do they want here and just how big and complex is the culture 'out there'?The answer to that could be truly earth shattering. Suppose a friendly alien shows up publicly and offers to answer questions and reveals that Earth is just a fairly typical planet among millions and there is millions of years worth of history culture and knowledge that we know nothing about. That would be a radical shift in humanity's self image of being masters of the cosmos. We would feel exposed, tiny and probably very scared. Maybe it's better for us not to know.  Another question is 'if the aliens are so advanced, why do we even suspect they are here?'. Perhaps ufo sightings are incredibly rare glimpses of a well hidden reality or that certain rogue factions just break the rules and like messing with primitive apes.  So much of this genre could be human-produced bullshit or a glimpse of a remarkable and terrifying reality. It really is fascinating and compelling, and while I treat evidence sceptically, I keep my mind open. It saddens me that so many people are so poor at judging what is real and what isn't which is why so many fakers are cashing in on the gullible. Now it's getting very difficult to tell what is real, but occasionally something interesting appears.  The best footage I've seen recently was from a plane very high altitude on south America. A passenger was filming through the window in full daylight with mountains and clouds far below. A silver disk emerges from one of the clouds and almost immediately goes back in. It's shape is clearly visible and its bright silver. It may have been faked but that was impressive."
UFOs,3dzsv9,kwangle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:16:11 2015 UTC,"there's very little that couldn't be explained by human trickery   Exactly right, which is troubling because there will always 'photoshop' or 'cgi' for skeptics to fall back on - always.  If a legitimate sighting does occur, it is going to have to damn near land on the white house lawn or on the field during the super bowl for people to actually believe it, which sucks.    Yeah, you could trick people in the past without 'shop or a computer, but it was (I think) easier to debunk and more time consuming to setup and pull off, so maybe some are legit - who knows.  Sad that our technological advances also serve to take away some of the wonder and mystery that comes with the subject.  *grammar"

UFOs,3dzsv9,rdavisisme,2,Tue Jul 21 20:07:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah its frustrating. But saying that, its still possible that something will happen that is hard to refute even though the wall of mindless scepticism against something that is potentially epoch-changing is absolutely huge.  I think if something completely alien looking and inexplicable was filmed in detail by multiple people in the same or different locations people would have to take notice, but then life would go on and it would be yesterday's news, largely ignored whilst humans get on with their lives. The phenomenon would continue to be something that is largely irrelevant for most people.  Sure, the debates would rage on for years and believers and debunkers would draw their battle lines but still not much would change beyond a renewed interest in the phenomenon.  I think aliens would have to impose themselves on humanity before the general population would take much notice beyond having a vague awareness that there is probably something mysterious out there that's not really any of our concern. I do think the human race would adapt to the realisation that alien intelligence probably is real  - and then just go on with the same ludicrous preoccupations (eg religion, politics, self-interest) we always have.  It would probably take years or decades for us to change our outlook beyond out own navels because we've never done anything else, though it's hard to predict the ramifications of something so big."
UFOs,3dzsv9,kwangle,3,Tue Jul 21 20:09:57 2015 UTC,"First, let's get away from this notion of ""proof."" Proof implies logical inevitability, which is probably out of reach, and it isn't the way science works. I'm not being a grammar Nazi - there really is an important difference. What we are looking for is evidence, bit by slowly convincing bit, and there are real problems with not only finding evidence, but identifying it as such.  That said, I think that all we have are intriguing hints and conjectures. Accept that we are almost certainly going to be wrong about what we think aliens from another world are, why they are here, and what kind of technology they have. Wrong again and again. We no more understand this problem now than natural philosophers in the 16th century understood electromagnetism.

Any person that gets famous through the UFO phenomenon and continue to be so for a long time is likely to be a con artist or having some mental issues, or both.

The transistor was a pretty logical solution to certain problems though undoubtedly massively significant in allowing the subsequent progression to accelerate.

Guiding these societies would be their eternal source of distraction because there wouldn't be much else to do in this Universe.  So yeah, they would either become the overlords of this Universe - benevolent ones I believe because once you completely master your environment and needs, there's no need to fight anymore - or would leave this Universe altogether to somewhere else... probably at the invite of someone from a higher Universe.

Information available online is pretty limited and the images of the original photos usually suffers from serious quality degradation thanks to compression artifacts. :(  Certainly the witnesses seem genuine and honest. I'd like to look into this further by reading the book you suggested and I'm definitely going to watch that documentary. Is there anything in the Italian article that isn't already mentioned in English articles?
UFOs,3dyl47,whatthefuckdoiknow,2,Mon Jul 20 17:44:47 2015 UTC,"In the article there's a funny fact: Gaspare De Lama didn't know why the Friends needed trucks full of water when they had an entire sea meters away. Then, suddenly, a voice popped out in his head, Sigir's voice, saying: ""Gaspare, change your thoughts!"".   Also, I don't remember if they say this in the documentary, the Friends said the Earth was one of the 50-60 planets in the galaxy which gave birth not only to life, but human life. They call those ""Mother planets"". There have been 6 civilizations on Earth, 5 of those just destroyed itself by nuclear wars and similar things. The 5th civilization knew interplanetary travel and some were able to escape the end of the civilization by colonizing another planet. So the Friends are just evolved humans who came from the 5th civilization, here to protect us and avoid our self-destruction until we reach a science development high enough to start thinking like them, without any rule or law, just by loving each other."

UFOs,3dyl47,kwangle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:05:52 2015 UTC,"IMHO It's almost impossible to invent a case as big as this one. Too many people involved, a story so wide yet so realistic, written in a 400 pages long book, many not fake photos and audios, including one with a W56 in the brushes, which is proven to be 3,04 meter high (metric system FTW). I can't find a reason for someone to invent such a big case, in fact it's much more interesting yet not as famous as cases like Roswell or Rendelsham."

UFOs,3dytfj,ftpgopher,3,Tue Jul 21 03:13:18 2015 UTC,"Its not a silly question and a bit of an elephant in the room. I see four possibilities. 1) An awful lot of bulls&*t artists and forgers going back a long way. 2) A lot of different alien civilizations each sending their own style of probe or ship to check out earth. 3) Many of these things have the ability to change their shape or appearance. 4) Ufos are some kind of phenomena we cant understand like being projections of our own minds or existing in some weird dimension slightly outside of our own space.  I will ignore 1 for the moment and talk about 2. I guess this is possible but this would imply some strange facts like aliens dont share information or why wouldnt they just visit once and just share it? Why all the interest? couldnt they just visit onetime from high orbit and get all the info they need in a earth rotation, catalog and be done with us. Why would ufos be so big? Even us humans right now would only need a drone the size of a basketball, in a few years probably a marble to get all the remote info we need. Their size tends to imply they are carrying a biological entity which makes no sense with the advantages of remote drone mentality. Assuming these are ancient civilizations most things tend to evolve towards one single design like a hammer or wrench gets to the point where its just fine as it is.  Regarding 3, This makes some sense, I can imagine shape change and more importantly the ability to heal structural damage would be a almost absolutely vital requirement for any sort of advanced space craft, in fact for anything it would be better. More likely however is they can change or warp the view of themselves as a cloaking or maybe a part of how they are able to zip through our dense atmosphere without making sonic booms and its this fact I am very interested in.  Point 4 is the weird out there idea of maybe they are living things, maybe they are projections from a future event or time travellers or portholes into another universe.  Its all very strange and the reason im here on r/ufos"
UFOs,3dzfvi,RRJA711,2,Mon Jul 20 19:53:55 2015 UTC,"Without getting into details no I remain unconvinced, in fact after reading the book I became less convinced if that was ""the best they could come up with"". I even read the second book ""Inside the Real Area 51: The Secret History of Wright Patterson"" and that made me even more skeptical of the whole thing, about the only interesting tipbits was the story of alien dental plaster and that memory metal really did seem to come out of a secret government lab but most of the evidence relating to roswell didnt pan out, especially with dates not matching to witness accounts. My main problems were the witness accounts were second or third or fourth hand and mostly centered around the undertaker trying to date some nurse on base who gave him the alien sketch supposedly and then she disappeared. Im sorry but that sounds like a girl just fobbing off an unwanted date to me and not something to build a centerpiece of the ufo world on, I think it came out she was living up in Washington when tracked down so she clearly wasnt interested in communicating with the guy which says a bunch.  Im not a fan of the whole Roswell case, it sounded good before the internet when facts were fuzzy and you just accepted the sensationalist tv documentary but with so much time and no one coming forward well there isnt much to go on. The evidence is very weak by anyones standards. In a nutshell the whole ordering small coffins part sounds interesting but even Marcel the man himself said the photos of him holding what for all the world looks like tinfoil and balsa was the actual pieces recovered. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roswell_UFO_incident#Problems_with_witness_accounts  Without any concrete evidence or someone more involved coming forward the project Mogul explanation is far more logical."

UFOs,3dvdth,Brutalducky,4,Sun Jul 19 21:03:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing! This is an excellent experience, especially if you haven't visited this sub or really written on the topic before. It is individuals like yourself that help the cause, for sure.  I had a few questions, though. You said you watched them over the horizon - were they very far away from you at this time? I don't so much mean in terms of miles - were you too far away to make out any more specific details of the lights, or were you able to catch a glimpse of their characteristics pretty well?  I ask because a few years ago, I saw two orange orbs fly directly over head occurring about 5 minutes apart.   They were similar to the ""upvote orange"" as well, except they had this type of luminous property to them that appeared more like a flickering flame or something - in other words, it didn't look similar to say the characteristics of a street light of the same color.   It also seemed to lose its distinct orange color toward the center of the light - its like the outer edges of the circular orange light was a pretty, flickering orange but the inside was composed of a fairly distinct bright white that did not seem to flicker like the orange part of it.   I watched this first orange orb approach from over the treeline of the horizon while talking with my two friends at the end of a night. I like to watch ANY light in the sky, so naturally I saw that this was the lights of a plane coagulating into one big, orangeish flickering ball of light. Just like I always see flying over my house.  Except it never changed its brightness as does a plane when it changes angles, and it finally goes from a bulbous orangeish light to the distinct red, blue, white blinking lights of the wing and tail. Instead, this held that same bulbous orange as it flew DIRECTLY overhead. And when I mean directly (to the best of my perspective of course), I mean I didn't even have to cock my head or move my body to get a better view of it - its like it was directly lined up with the bridge of my nose as I looked directly above me.  That is when I was able to discern the flickering, luminous orange color as well as the solid, white ""core"" of the light. This also brings me back to my question - did you see anything similar to that when observing the orange lights?  Anyway, 5-10 minutes later the same exact looking orange bulbous light appeared at the same exact point over the treeline down the horizon as the first one did. Immediately I thought ""this is too good to be true"" so I made sure to continue watching as it approached.  Sure enough, it was at least what I consider to be almost the same exact orange light in appearance, speed, maneuvers, etc. Orange flickering light on the outer rim, white-hot center that was unwavering and solid. This one, too, flew DIRECTLY above where my friends and I were standing, and it also was directly in line with the bridge of my nose where all I had to do was look directly up.  It was a little unnerving, simply because the altitude it seemed to be flying didn't match up with how loud I would expect a plane or a  helicopter to be. It was just dead silent. But this thing looked pretty damn low - I felt like I was looking at the ""undercarriage"" of it, even though it was just a glowing orange orb with a white center.  It just interested me that these two objects, both identical in appearance and having never been sighted by me again flew the EXACT same route as the one before it. I understand planes have flight paths, of course - but I know the flight paths in my town just from simply sitting and watching the skies; even a plane on the same flight path as another won't be in the SAME EXACT location of the sky (from my vantage point) as another plane. Instead, these two orange orbs looked like they could have been in the same exact position. Identical. On top of that, there is no chance that I actually saw just 1 orb, but twice - meaning that the first orange orb passed by, turned around and came back from where it came. It's like the first one lazily mozied out of sight and just a few minutes afterward the second appeared in the same path. The first wouldn't have time to circle back around.  Sorry to type this whole thing out in a comment, but I see things about orange orbs pop up quite frequently on here, and I can't help but think that maybe I experienced a similar case. Could be Chinese lanterns, but I doubt it. They seemed to large to be Chinese lanterns, not to mention the explanation as to how two chinese lanterns can follow the exact same route as one another given atmospheric conditions, wind, moisture, etc.  It's almost like these two orbs were attached by a wire that spanned miles, and that is why they followed such an identical path.  The thought dawned on me - and subsequently scared the shit out of me - that perhaps I was seeing 2 edges of a GIGANTIC craft - the third orange orb being out of sight, and completing the shape of the craft. That's just me having fun with my thoughts, but still an interesting experience nontheless.  Thanks again for sharing."
UFOs,3dvdth,prettymuchscrewedup,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:45:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the reply, they were a solid 30-40 miles out perhaps, I knew it was not a boat because it was much to high over the horizon, perhaps 60° over. I could see any of the white central lighting, but you mentioned how it came back a seocnd time. After that inital event, there was a similar cherry red dot even much farther out. It was alone, but it behaved differently. It would slowly pulse brighter and brighter, and then slowly dimmer. It did this for 30 minutes. And then it dimmed and never came back. Neither object appeared the next night :( I have always been open to the thought of other beings in our universe, but after that night, I believe. There are other beings, and they are visiting. On a lighter note, maybe they wanted to visit the lake too? It is a popular spot haha."
UFOs,3dvdth,prettymuchscrewedup,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:56:35 2015 UTC,"Hey, who wouldn't wanna visit the lake too? haha!   Yeah, definitely an interesting experience for sure. Regardless of me comparing my experience to yours, it does not change the fact that you saw these objects behave in a fashion that is typically sought after in UFO videos - and that is evidence of breaking laws of physics - I.e, lifting and accelerating out of sight much quicker than any craft that we are familiar with.  Now, in your opinion, did it appear to you to definitely accelerate upward and disappear? Or could it have been a rapid fade-away due to fog/moisture/etc?"
UFOs,3dvdth,prettymuchscrewedup,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:16:26 2015 UTC,"So they were in the single file line, they all rotated slightly against the horizon, and I'm assuming they went up. After they rotated, it blurred upwards and it was gone."
UFOs,3dvdth,prettymuchscrewedup,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:32:03 2015 UTC,"Its a little tough for me to visualize, but I think I understand (though please feel free to correct me if I am wrong).  So what you are saying is that from a distance of about 50 miles, at the horizon, you see a string of orange lights in a single file line with one red light. They are rotating slightly against the horizon. This is where I get slightly confused - is it that you thought they were rotating because it appeared as if they were raising and then lowering, raising and lowering? Or was it more like the lights going from left to right, left to right - indicating that they were travelling in a circular pattern, almost as if one were to spin a bicycle wheel while holding it horizontally in front of their eyes? If that makes ANY sense at all."

That could be good or bad, but if I had to take a guess then I would say chances are high we (and I mean US) broke an agreement. However, since it would be a secret agreement made by world leaders, I don't think the human race as a whole could be held accountable. Now man-made issues like pollution, nuclear proliferation, climate change - those are known to most of us and I would argue we'd have to accept much more responsibility if there were agreements around those.   but how would people react to seeing a press conference with a grey.   It all depends on the circumstances, doesn't it. And perhaps even more on how world media would spin it. I do think we may be too savage as a species for direct open contact of that nature. Perhaps some sort of non-threatening-looking emissary devices for information/negotiation would be useful to gain human acceptance. Think Wall-E / R2D2, something we're already broadly conditioned to sympathise or relate with. Definitely add holograms and be prepared to be real patient in explaining things to us."

A BBC Radio 5 sports reporter saw a UFO in 2011 (brief audio interview here) and Good was seamlessly edited into the interview before the end (at 2:28) (without introduction??) as if to be the same guy talking and what he said was whackado. If Good was the real thing he wouldn't have said what he said and the way that he said it. It really felt like clever misinformation to discredit the sighting. He has since been added to my list of people to avoid along with Greer and others."
UFOs,3dw01j,GLOBALSHUTTER,4,Mon Jul 20 00:44:21 2015 UTC,"As someone else stated below - Pope thrives on his status from his previous employer. He brings no original thoughts or information to the table. I think the radiation spikes are significant - they are not conclusive in way - but they are significant. The problem is so many people embroider the story in their bid for 15 minutes of fame and it all gets horribly misleading. I'd like to take this opportunity to point something out which is a little known fact about Rendlesham though. It is HIGHLY UNLIKELY that anyone was mistaking the Orford Ness Lighthouse light for what they thought they saw. Orford Ness Lighthouse (like most lighthouses) has a steel cover behind it to stop the blinding light from shining inland (can you imagine how horrid it would be having a lighthouse light sweeping across your house every few seconds?) The light only shone outward toward the sea - not inland. The link below leads to an image of the Lighthouse and you can see the cover behind it to prevent the light from shining inland - https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Orford_Ness_Lighthouse,_Suffolk.jpg"
UFOs,3dw01j,Phoenix_One,3,Mon Jul 20 01:56:55 2015 UTC,"(can you imagine how horrid it would be having a lighthouse light sweeping across your house every few seconds?)   Um, well, actually, speaking as someone who lived in the UK for many years within stones throw of the sea, you could actually see lighthouses blinking on and off depending on where you were, and as a kid we would often sit up on a wall or whatnot and point out the nearest one to us on clear nights, so I'm afraid you're wrong about that.   However, I've also been to Rendlesham, and although it was a good many years ago, and just as many years after the famous events, in my opinion you wouldn't have been able to see the lighthouse from Halt's position."
UFOs,3dw01j,CaerBannog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:47:49 2015 UTC,"Well as someone who sub contracted with the Northern Lighthouse Board in the UK I can assure you that any inward light movement is minimised by screening it out with backboards. Like you say though - depending on where you are it is possible to see light. I too recall seeing lighthouses when I was a kid in Ayrshire. Something reassuring about it.  But again as you say from Halt's position and the screening on the Orford Ness Lighthouse, he and his men would have seen light travelling away out to sea if they saw anything at all - not incoming. Depending on where a lighthouse is situated it's possible to be further out longitudinally or latitudinally than the Lighthouse and so see a half rotation or even a whole rotation of a light. In the case of Orford Ness - it just couldn't happen, it's screened.   Edited to add - 'It's screened.'"

UFOs,3dw01j,CaerBannog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:14:17 2015 UTC,Would it be possible for the screen to fail and produce a landward light? If this happened what colour would the light be and how long would it take to get mended?
UFOs,3dw01j,mitch1975,0,Mon Jul 20 21:29:39 2015 UTC,Regarding the lighthouse this video from a news crew at the time clearly shows a lighthouse blinking in the same intervals reported by the witnesses from the locations they described inland. http://www.ianridpath.com/ufo/vince.mov there is another video here http://chillfactorfilms.com/media/ clearly showing a flashing orange light and there is a bunch of logical info about it here http://www.ianridpath.com/ufo/rendlesham1c.htm and here http://www.ianridpath.com/ufo/rendlesham2.htm#brightness It clearly did shine inwards.

Sounds like a classic acid / stoner freakout to me. Even Johns ""hypnosis"" fantasy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UW5GVNl0vho where he quickly lies and includes guns for dramatic effect (quickly mincing his words on the fly as he realizes the official report will state they didnt have guns) only includes talks about lists somewhere off in the distance of the forest, watching this video with the more believable explanation of a lighthouse you cant help but think he was tripping while rolling around in the dirt because of lights in the distance."

So I agree Halt was sober but John and perhaps Jim I have question marks about their sobriety as I just cannot imagine lying down in the dirt in a cold UK forest at night because of seeing lights in the distance. Its possible they both just got really bored patrolling a base in the middle of nowhere."

That said I dont think it was a lighthouse and if you stick to the original  report & tape recording  it seems like something more."
UFOs,3dw01j,mitch1975,2,Mon Jul 20 13:19:08 2015 UTC,"The same could be said for literally hundreds of facts or lack thereof about the case. For me the main problem is that witnesses including Burroughs and the other men present in their own irrefutable handwritten report on the night said they followed the lights to a beacon marker (it was an airport after all) and then further lights turned out to be a farmhouse and a lighthouse. http://www.ianridpath.com/ufo/rendlesham2c.htm  If you trust Pennistons version of what happened then you also have to trust his 30yr later ""remembered"" telepathic binary codes for his personal secret mission to save the world.. not kidding. The guy even got busted in a lie on a radio show and Bourroughs can be seen on youtube misrepresenting events while under ""hypnosis"".  Regarding Pope while he seems like a nice guy but he brings almost nothing to the table personally as evidence and thrives on his UFO researcher status due to his previous MOD status. In many ways Rendlesham propelled his launch into UFO stardom by association of nationality as at the time many Americans in the field were getting bored of talking about Roswell where there is even fewer facts to research.  A final word is to prepare for downvotes aplenty, many members of r/ufos hold Rendlesham sacrosanct without looking at or challenging any of the questionable facts neatly outlined in IanRidpath link. Most likely there will just be nasty little personal accusations and ridiculous claims of being a paid shill for some government of their choice."

UFOs,3dwixl,bobjoefrank,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:24:17 2015 UTC,"I really don't have any idea as to what this could be. Even if it is terrestrial/human-based in origin, it definitely transcends anything that I have the knowledge of even to apply critically to it.  I'm seeing a ton of lights, all flickering multiple colors at varying intervals as well as other lights that are coasting through these blinking lights at a steady pace.  In my mind, I rule out satellites at this point. They're usually a single solidified point in the sky, not unlike a the appearance of a star. The ISS will often times appear larger and more bulbous than a typical satellite, and that still obviously doesn't apply here. I have also heard of satellites having 2-3 lights visible to the viewer on the ground, but even that does not explain what I'm watching in this video.  For some reason, one of the first thoughts that came to mind were the videos of failed missile launches being falsely uploaded as UFO videos. They appear unique because the fuel leaking out of the capsule and into the sky glows and spirals. This looks nothing like that, but my mind started to go in the direction of speculating on remnants or pieces of some craft/material/whatever that split up like confetti, fell to earth, and refracts light as they descend to the Earth. This could explain the colors and the lights flickering at varying intervals (the ""confetti"" would be refracting all sorts of different light, each piece taking on a unique appearance on its way down).  One thing that plagues videos of UFOs that are consolidated balls of light or orbs is the Quadrocopter (NOT DRONES) theory. I'm completely down with that - they're quick, can be fitted with multi colored lights, and can be flown in accordance with other friends who may also fly a Quad Copter. Except here, I don't imagine there were thousands of these things being flown by people on the ground.  Planes and helicopters - maybe? Doubtful in my mind, though. The lights have no consistency, and as we all know, aircraft have very strict protocol on their lighting depending on the type of aircraft it is. With all the different colors and variations of light in this video, I don't think that helps the helicopter and plane argument. Not to mention the sheer number of them. That would be more aircraft in the sky than there would be during an airshow or something.  Of course, it could simply be a fake. A fraud. I sincerely hope not because I'm actually pretty intrigued by this video - but of course we mustn't forget that (shitty) possibility.  This is just where my mind went when viewing this. I don't actually believe my explanation to be the truth, or even a possibility. This is just my unfiltered thought process on an interesting video.  Thanks for your contribution.  EDIT: I found this video in the comments of the Youtube video posted above. This individual brings up the possibility of these lights being balloons with LED lights on the inside. He also posts a video of the balloons from a wedding in the past as reference here (skip to about a minute in or so to see the people let the balloons loose) to me, this seems like the most reasonable option as to what we are seeing in OP's video.   Again, no conclusions being made, but I think that the link I included in my Edit is at least the most similar in appearance to what we are seeing in OP's video."
UFOs,3dwixl,prettymuchscrewedup,3,Mon Jul 20 06:00:27 2015 UTC,The only simple explanation I could think of is a mass release of LEDs tied to balloons since there's no anomalous behavior in their motion. Other than that I have no other explanations than the ones you've already offered.
UFOs,3dwixl,whatthefuckdoiknow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:15:59 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you posted this reply before or after I included the edit into my comment, but that is what I am thinking currently as well. The reference video that the individual in the Youtube comments posted is pretty compelling in terms of similarities.  On top of that, most UFO footage of orbs or balls of light are typically solitary lights (which is why we always go for Quad Copter, Satellite, Plane, etc) but the fact that this (to me, at least) is a fairly unique video in that it shows possibly HUNDREDS of solidified balls of light - it appears to me that the balloon argument is further supported by that.  I also noticed something upon viewing the video for a third time - although the intervals of the lights changing and flickering SEEM to be random, if you look closely (and I can't exactly put my finger on it), it seems as if there IS a pattern of some sort. Kind of like they flicker rapidly for a moment in a variety of colors and then the cycle of those same colors start over. Then it repeats. This, to me, implies some type of coordination in terms of whatever the balls of light are.  Now, in terms of the balloon theory - when someone is planning a wedding or an event that would call for such an insane amount of balloons to be let into the air (not to mention taking the effort to insert LED lights into each of them - unless you buy them like that already, but that just further proves my point), it is understandable that perhaps each of those balloons would have the same characteristics simply because nobody is going to go through the effort of customizing each balloon with a different LED light. No, they would probably buy the same set of 100 small LED lights that flicker red, blue, white, red, blue, white repeatedly and insert those same lights into each balloon. No reason to customize each balloon with a unique light. So while at first the flickering may seem completely random, perhaps it is just the same product (balloon and LED light inside) being activated at different times. In other words, if I activated a balloon and let it go and then you activated your balloon and let it go, our colored lights would not be blinking at the same interval just due to the fact that I released mine a second earlier - so mine will blink red while yours blinks blue, mine would blink white when yours blinks red. If that makes sense. Why am I up this late typing an essay about this shit. Actually, I know why - Because this is exactly the type of critical dialogue that needs to be had while looking at UFO videos."
UFOs,3dwixl,prettymuchscrewedup,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:19:47 2015 UTC,"I must've replied not long before your edit. I thought I read it over carefully, but I may have overlooked part of it. It was, after all, nearly 2 a.m.  Another possibility is that the LEDs were attached to strings and they were twirling around. I agree-- if someone was planning such an event they'd likely buy a large quantity of the same kind.  I wish we knew a little more about the video, such as what time this was observed. If it was early in the night the balloon explanation would make more sense than if it was filmed at 3 in the morning.   Why am I up this late typing an essay about this shit. Actually, I know why - Because this is exactly the type of critical dialogue that needs to be had while looking at UFO videos.   Exactly!"

At that point, my respect for him became nil. And my view is shared by many other people in UFO research right now.   I did not know about the unaccredited university, but am not particularly surprised.

Even their very existence is debated as they have been since they first became a part of popular culture in the late 40s. Reported sightings go well beyond that decade, however.   I'm convinced the phenomenon is real. What UFOs are is another matter altogether.  As disappointing as this may be, you, me and everyone else may never find conclusive answers.

UFOs,3dwgvp,playfulpenis,6,Mon Jul 20 02:45:10 2015 UTC,"Like CaerBannog says, nobody knows. So this is a great opportunity for us to entertain some speculation, and let's let it get as wild and creative as it can get, for once.  But before I give my opinion, I think it's worth remembering that all visual phenomena and the states of mind they affect ultimately take place entirely within the confines of our skulls. We should never forget the ultimate locus of cognition as we know it.  My take? First of all, I split the UFO phenomena into two types: aerial, arguably intelligent phenomena that are not craft so much as they are strange lights or objects, and craft that are encountered in closer, technological detail, often in conjunction with all manner of humanoid occupants. The former I have experienced myself, so I can attest at least to the fact that they occur during what I'd call normal, waking life. The latter, well let's just say I'm on the fence on whether those encounters, from the Hills to Travis Walton or even Whitley Strieber, are real in the same sense. For those cases, my needle jumps sharply from ""demonstrably objective"" to ""strongly, questionably subjective"".  Continued, these CE3+ experiences that I have never experienced in any sort of waking way, I relegate to the caveat I first mentioned - these types of encounters with UFO occupants sound to me like they may occur in the same kind of subjective ""reality"" that we know as the world of dreams. This is supported by the complete lack of good physical evidence when it comes to these cases. Indeed, you often hear cases in which dreamlike logic seems to pervade the events. And then there are the many dreams I've myself had that have evoked most of the CE3 narratives we all know and love, but in the end I woke up in bed every time.  TL;DR so far: UFO occupant encounters, alien abductions, and all manner of humanoid weirdness are all in the experiencers' heads to a large degree if not entirely. But that doesn't mean they're not without meaning, and I want to acknowledge that the sheer volume of reported encounters support the notion that something external to us is happening.  The other kind of UFOs, the kind I've seen, are, in my opinion, purposeful demonstrations of the existence of something beyond our current comprehension, something we will never fully understand until we radically evolve past the point of whatever singularity our fate has in store for us. They are like those black and white baby toys we hang above cribs because they supposedly stimulate the baby's mental development. I believe that there is definitely an intelligence behind them, but there is scant data to know whether it's a race of beings, or some universal mind running a simulation. But I feel that communication with this ""other"" is likely to be eventually possible.  In this sense, I can reconcile both the first type of UFO case that I skeptically dismissed as altered states of consciousness, and the stranger CE3+ encounters that I don't think are 100% real, as both being psychological and possibly physiological experiments being carried out on people (and maybe other species, but definitely people as an anthropologist might study other cultures) by an external intelligence of unknown origin. Why? I speculate it is to encourage, instigate, or otherwise cause some form of adaptation, evolution... or maybe just to yield some data for the next quarterly universe board meeting powerpoints.  I can give another TL;DR here: many believers want First Contact with UFO occupants, but I think the actual intelligence(s) behind them, if we were suddenly all exposed to the actual truth abruptly and en masse - well, I fear it would indeed cause a severe disruption to society. It is a thing that is just that far beyond us. And thus this phenomenon continues to occur as it must beyond a veil of incomprehensibility and repulsiveness.  just edited some typos"

UFOs,3dwgvp,ASK47,4,Mon Jul 20 04:17:14 2015 UTC,".... I find this question like being asked what is my favourite food. I don't have one favourite! I can't choose. And I can't put anything in a nutshell!  I vacillate between various possibilities depending on how I'm feeling at the time. I'm overwhelmed with the enormity of strangeness when faced with the reports. There is also apparent evidence of intelligent control exhibited by some reported phenomena.   Sometimes I think there's an ET explanation, maybe that's the most logical. At other times I think there's something much stranger going on, perhaps some kind of consciousness manifesting itself in a completely inscrutable way. I think sometimes it is more than one thing, and we're looking at a whole bunch of different things layered on each other in the reports.   Right now my favourite idea is that we're living in a simulation, and there are bugs in the program. This would neatly explain a lot of Forteana, human consciousness, and physics conundrums. I like neat explanations. It's elegant, and is possible, some claim it might even be probable.   But I'm not going to commit to one idea, because I just don't have enough evidence to go on. The more I study this, the weirder it gets, and the less sure I am what is really going on. But I'm convinced of what I said above, that nobody really knows. Certainly not the governments."

UFOs,3dwgvp,CaerBannog,2,Mon Jul 20 06:39:26 2015 UTC,"Why the owl on Nick's book Superintelligence? Ufology and abduction lore is replete with owls. Even Tom Laughlin had an eerie owl experience before making Billy Jack (see @18min mark),  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC4Q-Bz0K-I   and if he's to be believed/not disbelieved, it was a portent of great success for the project, but it needed an interpreter b/c everyone else just stopped at the simple interpretation of, ""It means death.""  And is the AI/simulation hypo any better or different than Susskind's Holographic Principle? Was a time that we were told we couldn't really understand or appreciate ""reality"" unless we were mathematicians, and now we'd have to be programmers instead? As God said to Pascal said, ""You wouldn't look for me if you hadn't already found me.""   I would (respectfully) ask Caer and everybody else, if there were a vantage point outside the phenomena from which we could ""objectively"" observe the goings on of ""reality,"" where would it be and how would we get there? Or, if Susskind et al. are correct and the physical universe is actually a 2D projection imitating 4D spacetime, where does that get us or leave us? Has ""evolution"" evolved us as a self-deluded species capable of ""growing"" or expanding or contravening or transcending the very nature of reality?"
UFOs,3dwgvp,laowhoo,2,Tue Jul 21 13:25:14 2015 UTC,"Why the owl on Nick's book Superintelligence?   Yeah, I wouldn't put it past Bostrom to be aware of the owl trope in abduction lore, but I'd more put it down to the owl being the symbol of wisdom (in Western culture). The owl then represents the higher mind, as avatar of Athena; an intelligence beyond human.   Also, it's usually someone in the publishing company that decides on the cover, not the author, but who knows.    ""It means death.""   Native American lore tends to associate owls with death, IIRC. In Africa it is witchcraft. The Old World draws from Hellenic symbolism, so it is wisdom and the arts for those of a Caucasian persuasion :)   And is the AI/simulation hypo any better or different than Susskind's Holographic Principle?   Susskind's Holographic Principle as I understand it is more a thought experiment describing how the matter/energy information matrix of our physical universe may be bound in a two dimensional plane rather than three dimensional, drawing comparison with how a hologram has the information of a 3-D object in a 2-D plane.   The Simulation Hypothesis suggests that it may be ultimately more likely that we are in a complex simulation than in a naturally arising physical matter/energy universe. The ideas may overlap, but only insofar as the theorist wants them to, I suppose.   if there were a vantage point outside the phenomenon from which we could ""objectively"" observe the goings on of ""reality,"" where would it be and how would we get there?   Well, I can't answer that, and I would posit that it would be impossible for a sim to understand what is going on in the bigger reality, because it is impossible for the sub-system to be aware or to have a map of the super-system, by definition.  Then again, theorist Tom Campbell claims there is nothing that a truly Aware Consciousness cannot do in terms of perception and that it is ""easy"" to travel between non-physical ""reality frames"". His clause is that because of the rules of our local reality frame, there wouldn't be much point in having full access to the reality in which it is nested, because it would obviate the point of the existence of this reality frame in the first place.   where does that get us or leave us?    There have been plenty of people who have written about this, but I am less interested in Susskind's holographic principle than I am in the simulation argument, because the former is an attempt to conceptualise a whole bunch of theoretical physics, whereas the latter seems to me more satisfactory on an experiential level as well as phenomenological. I have no idea if that makes sense at all."

From my experiences, I have come to the conclusion that are two polar forces. I don't know what they are, or want, and I don't know who is who.   My sightings usually take place with multiple flashes, same spot, for prolonged periods, with small orbs moving in the area. After a while (varies from 10 minutes, to 1 1/2 hours) different orbs (size, colors, brightness) come to chase off the flashes and other orbs. The flashing object(?) always leaves very slowly, taking up to 20 minutes to get out of sight, depending on visibility."

UFOs,3dwgvp,laowhoo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:42:49 2015 UTC,"Somebody knows the answer to this, but I am not that person.  As most have said, only speculation can derive an answer.  Different ways of thinking equal different answers as to what they are and who controls them.  Personally, I believe a good bit of the authentic sightings are what they have mostly been proposed to be, a (or many) extraterrestrial species.  There is too long of a history of unusual ""airships"" that predate the 1940s and while some can be dismissed as natural phenomena (weather, meteors, etc), many cannot be and exhibit behaviors even beyond most modern day aircraft today.  But, as with anything that does not have substantial evidence I can only speculate my beliefs to be true.  Someone of religion may consider them angels or demons.  Others may believe them to be government projects or drones (those typically seen today), or many other things.  However, there are many even in high ranking government positions, astronauts, military and now, a majority of the public believes that extraterrestrials have visited us.  Based on surveys performed over the past few decades, the amount of people who believe aliens have indeed visited us has jumped to around 1/3 of those surveyed and likely higher.  While the media (movies, TV programs) may have a large part of these numbers, it appears that even with the little evidence available to the public (mostly through eyewitness accounts and experiences), a change in the way most people think towards our existence has taken place.  While I'm not saying 100% that ET(s) have visited us on our polluted and corrupt little planet, it is far more plausible than other suggestions that are often more impossible than me hitting the lottery!"

UFOs,3dwvgm,whatthefuckdoiknow,3,Mon Jul 20 06:24:44 2015 UTC,"The beginning of the video shows a camera using a low f-number and a very high ISO, which gives the wrong impression that it's still kind of bright outside while it's actually pitch black for the people being there. That's why the lights and the people's screens look so overexposed.   Later on in camera 3 it shows more what reality would've look like. Just two small dots of light, probably Geers coworkers going out in a boat and shooting some flares for the gullible people who payed to be on the shore."

'You'll never forget that colour' - yeah, dickhole, its the same orange as a sodium streetlight.  The low altitude and proximity to the sea and lack of movement from the lights means this is much more fakeable. I admit it looks quite impressive on the first camera with the light reflecting off the clouds, but on another its just two unimpressive dots.  I think therefore that the image is hugely over exposed making something compartively small look impressive whilst concealing important details in the near total dark.

UFOs,3dwvgm,ghostdate,4,Mon Jul 20 05:13:28 2015 UTC,"What makes you think they're not flares? There's parachuted illumination flares meant for illuminating an area. The heat from the flare rises into the chute and keeps it aloft for a longer time, but it still descends over the course of a couple of minutes, much like the object in the video. From that distance (looks like it's at least a kilometre or two out to sea) you wouldn't see the smoke or chute, just a glowing orb.   I don't entirely trust Greer, because he's gotten so crazy with the meditation and chakras, and charging hundreds of dollars to sit at the beach with him. I wouldn't be surprised if he paid someone to drop flares during this meditation/summoning session. It could just be a coincidence that the military was doing an exercise at the same time as well, I mean it's not like this happens at every event he hosts, so his methods don't have any consistent results."

As rapidly as I could, I explained to them about seeing the light and that I just wanted to try and get some video of it, that honest to goodness I had no idea they were out there, that I agreed with their point of view(I don't), and that I wasn't a cop they settled down, and started asking me what I thought the light in the sky was, etc., etc.  The head guy(the wizard?) finally told me to ""step on home son, and forget what you saw out here"". I thanked him, and went the fuck back home.  EDIT-I should add they checked my camera to make sure I didn't have any video of them."

UFOs,3dso8t,ObjectReport,-1,Sun Jul 19 05:30:01 2015 UTC,"If there's a drone that's lit up like a Christmas tree and can make right angle turns at speed, I've never heard of it.   Drones can make tight turns because there is no human on board. The G-force shouldn't matter other than keeping the drone stable.  As for lights. When I see lights, I immediately think it is man made. Why would aliens use lights when they try to stay hidden."

Drove up there with some friends chasing what might have been a UFO (was very slow moving so not 100% sure) kept tailing it down a dirt road and came across a group of maybe 15 dudes in full on white hooded Klan suits circled around a cross in the woods. Not burning but could still clearly see their Klan outfits. I was the only white dude in our group so we high tailed it out of there."

UFOs,3dso8t,5643354635,4,Sun Jul 19 19:38:05 2015 UTC,Since 2006 my partner and I have run one of the top UFO news & resource websites on the web. We get millions of unique views from around the world on a monthly basis and every time I look at the server logs I see visits from every 3-letter agency and branch of the military (mostly Navy) on nearly a daily basis. Could it just be that people who work for these agencies are interested in the topic and visit our website on their lunch breaks or something? Sure. But either way it's pretty creepy to see that much regular traffic from alphabet soup agencies. I would classify it as 'scary'.

It can be windy at higher altitudes while there may be relatively little wind at ground level. Any guess as to its height and distance from you?  Was it luminescent?

My gf said she thought it looked like it was ""in space"" but I'm not sure if i agree with that.  It was luminescent. This is a rural area so not reflecting city lights. And the light it emitted was not from electric lights.  We could see it for 45 seconds to 1 min.  Several minutes after  we got outside someone approx 1/4 to 1/2 mile away detonated an ""M80"" or very loud firework that was not a rocket. Then they did a bunch of other fireworks that included rockets, roman candles and such.  But there had not been any fireworks prior to when we saw the object.  I did wonder if it could have been a floating lantern thing. I recently saw such a thing for sale at a local store.  Whatever it was it really was fantastic. It didnt feel like it was floating but moving and not the wind was moving much. Not many clouds, almost none. And the wind rarely comes from the direction it came from."

UFOs,3dj9b4,CaerBannog,9,Fri Jul 17 04:26:36 2015 UTC,"Edgar Mitchell endorsed the non-human status of the ""Roswell slides"". They were clearly of a human mummy. This was a disaster for UFO research and everyone involved.  I respect Mitchell for his work and career, but his judgment is unsound. He can never be used as a credible support for anything in this field."
UFOs,3dj9b4,ParanoidFactoid,4,Fri Jul 17 03:47:00 2015 UTC,Jesus. Have you ever actually communicated with Dr. Mitchell? I have. You're full of shit.
UFOs,3dj9b4,onemananswerfactory,-3,Fri Jul 17 09:54:55 2015 UTC,"Were you asking Jesus if He has ever spoken to Dr. Mitchell, or just tossing His name around like a slang term?  Respect, bro. You're asking for it for your Mitchell buddy, so a little reciprocity is in order."
UFOs,3dj9b4,ParanoidFactoid,3,Fri Jul 17 19:04:45 2015 UTC,"No, I think I took the Lord's name in vain there. Or His son's. Not quite sure how that works."
UFOs,3dj9b4,onemananswerfactory,-6,Fri Jul 17 19:16:16 2015 UTC,"Well, Jesus is the visible image of God, but your attempt to blaspheme was a miss. What you did wasn't taking the Lord's name in vain because the English translation of the commandment is wrong.  In Hebrew it's ""Do not carry the Lord's name in vain."" Meaning don't pretend to be a follower of God and not be, or don't do things contrary to God's laws and claim it was God who asked you to do it. Essentially, don't misrepresent Him.  You believe in aliens, yet not the supernatural. Odd."

UFOs,3dj9b4,toontune,3,Sat Jul 18 02:16:12 2015 UTC,"Wish we knew the circumstances of his endorsement of the slides. Did a trusted friend simply tell him about them and get his ok? Did he view them at all? Maybe that info is out there and some of you who are more tapped into the community know about it.  At any rate, it's a shame. From just this interview, he sounds sensible to me. I think he's right about sustainability and overpopulation. His thoughts about science are interesting, as is what he says about other stuff. Just from this interview, I'd not guess that he has credibility issues. I assume you and others here know more about his past than I do. But what a shame that this guy who seems so thoughtful and grounded (a bit of a Jimmy Carter vibe) here in his later years, has that credibility cloud over him."
UFOs,3dj9b4,ParanoidFactoid,10,Fri Jul 17 09:46:35 2015 UTC,"Though old, Mitchell remains very sound of mind. He's also consistent that he is not a personal witness to events at Roswell, but grew up in the area and had certain facts confirmed to him by Sr military staffers by Joint Chiefs at the Pentagon.  He believes what he was told. And he speaks to that belief. But he does not offer personal witness testimony. He has always been clear about this. Take his perspective or leave it as you will.   But Dr. Mitchell is absolutely sound of mind. I can personally confirm this to be true as recently as eight months ago."
UFOs,3dj9b4,CaerBannog,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:11:31 2015 UTC,"I respect and admire him, and agree with many of his views, but in terms of using him as authoritative endorsement of ETH & UFOs he's not much good now, and that is kind of the tone of the post ""look here's an astronaut that agrees UFOs are real, so listen to us"".   Due to Mitchell's new age beliefs and the slides fiasco he can easily be targeted by debunkers."
UFOs,3dj9b4,KetchupExplosion,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:34:11 2015 UTC,"You are assuming the slides that Mitchell and Dolan saw was indeed what got released. It could have been a ploy to discredit two of, I think, the best outspoken people on this topic.  These guys know their stuff, why would they endorse a load of garbage, they have literally nothing to gain and more to lose.  I mean listen to yourself, if it was all a plan then that is exactly the sort of response they would want.  Have the US released 4 official explanations for Roswell? There have been more than 1 so its pretty obvious they want this under wraps, and it seems will go to some lengths to carry on with a cover up. With that in mind, my theory doesn't seem so far fetched."
UFOs,3dj9b4,laowhoo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:58:01 2015 UTC,"I never looked into the slides--the whole thing smelled from the start--but you couldn't help but hear about the subsequent fallout. Seems the people who got the press afterwards were the profiteers, and Dolan was one of these. Those involved in the production circus took the money and kept the money, and it was a very good pay day. And Dolan only prevaricates about his part in all of it."

UFOs,3dj9b4,laowhoo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:57:58 2015 UTC,"I certainly have responded positively to many of Caer's posts. In fact, we've only come to blows once, when he played too freely with the John Mack facts, and I'm still not sure what upset me more, that he unjustifiably maligned Mack (who i like for lots of reasons), or that he unjustifiably maligned Mack (which is not like Caer--he's usually nuanced and well-informed when he drops the hammer on members of the UFO circus).  But has Caer ever responded favorably to my posts? Certainly not. It's not his style, and he has too much independence to be bothered with such trivialities."

As fascinating as this case is, you might be interested to know that Vallee questions the whole incident as well, as a possible military psyop, and when you consider all the meddling that followed, not to mention the general confusion and discrepancies amongst the witnesses, Vallee's suggestion seems even more plausible. I'm not saying it's true (and neither is Vallee), but Rendlesham does have its problems.

The speakers are clearly shot against green screen with the background, podium and screen added in post production. The echo on the voices is, I strongly suspect, also fake to give the impression that the location is an auditorium or hall. The whole tone is geared to make it seem like there is an audience when in fact I suspect it is just a green screen room a speaker and a film crew.  That level of deliberate contrivance and the active participation of the speakers to maintain the illusion that the subject material is very important does strike me as somewhat dishonest and hurts the credibility of the participants whatever their material contains."

UFOs,3dl8e7,laowhoo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:18:58 2015 UTC,"It doesn't really look green screen to me.  it looks like they used editing software to overlay the ad over the podium and overlay video over the screen used in the presentation to make it more visible.   I looked it up and there was a ""secret space"" conference in San Mateo, CA on June 28th and 29th and Richard Dolan did indeed speak on the 29th.    That said, a lot of what Dolan says can be dismissed off-hand.  He's an intelligent man and his heart is in the right place but he's one of those ""I want to believe"" types who accepts everything he hears as truth without corroboration of any kind.  He's not actually trying to hoax people but he presents hoaxes because of his willingness to believe anything anybody tells him.   It's a sad situation he has created for himself.  With the amount of time and energy he puts into this he may actually find true information to present and inform.  The trouble is that we will never know that it's true as it will be just another random piece of information he presents completely surrounded by fantasies and hoaxes because he believes everything he hears to be true and presents it all as such.    His problem is that he wants to believe instead of wanting to uncover evidence that leaves him no other choice but to believe."

Its kind of a study of human nature and everyone on this sub should do something similar to this as an exercise -- it will help you become more objective is what I'm saying.   I'm also implying that any subject like the UFO phenomena is fraught with people that are just making a buck speculating and taking a huge group of people for a ride.    I have friends that have seen real phenomena -- family members even that have witnessed stuff.  I know there's something to the UFO phenomena in other words.

There are plenty of ways of dancing around the topic by asking questions in different forms and accepting evidence at lower standards than science would normally allow. But if there were any hard physical evidence then there would be no debate. Usually what I notice is that all believers really have to go on is anecdotal evidence and low quality videos/pictures which usually end up being hoaxes. It is always important to remember that just because we want something to be true does not mean that it is."
UFOs,3dh36g,RUoffended,2,Thu Jul 16 16:47:57 2015 UTC,That's exactly why I worded  my post carefully and asked that there be no debate or hairsplitting…
UFOs,3dh36g,laowhoo,2,Thu Jul 16 20:22:24 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid it may violate your criteria, either for ""physical"" or for ""cliche,"" but it may not be so simple as you're asking. Consider Ted Phillips who began as a physical trace investigator for Hynek. After 30+ years of such, and most recently with 10+ years at ""Marley Woods,"" he now regrets having ignored all the other anomalous activity that attended his earlier work.   http://www.theparacast.com/podcast/now-playing-august-1-2010-%E2%80%94-co-host-christopher-obrien-with-ted-phillips/  Giant dogs and hooded apparitions that steal basketballs but which are unaffected by guns, poltergeist activity, etc., were never in his original wheelhouse, any more than are the materialization and de-materialization of the UFOs he's been encountering. And although he now resorts to some ""extra-dimensional"" hypo to account for everything, he's not comfortable doing so and is even fearful about admitting all the rest b/c it would likely undermine his credibility. In brief, he has no idea what's happening, and stranger still is the ""evolution"" of Marley Woods as it seems to be becoming every bit as strange as Skinwalker Ranch."
UFOs,3dh36g,laowhoo,3,Thu Jul 16 13:11:36 2015 UTC,It's a podcast about photos and crushed fence is broken cameras and mutilated horses… So yes it violates the criteria of physical material evidence that I was asking about
UFOs,3dh36g,laowhoo,3,Thu Jul 16 14:54:42 2015 UTC,"Then I have to ask a question--how would you be satisfied that the ""physical material evidence"" is ""verifiable?"" Would it contain some element not in our periodic table, some impossible or hitherto unknown isotope? Maybe some violation of the Standard Model? Uranium 235 is the shortest lived isotope still found on earth (half life of 704 megayears) and produced by natural nuclear reaction. I suppose you could make a qualification that it would have to contain one of the 10 or 11 that we (earth) don't have any longer, but would that be verifiable evidence of what you're asking? What about the additional 1650 or so isotopes that we create in nuclear reactors and particle accelerators?"

UFOs,3dh36g,dute,2,Thu Jul 16 20:34:50 2015 UTC,"Nobody's picking apart your question. You speak of ""physical evidence"" as though it's clear what that is. Granted, it's easy to assume that what you mean by this is the same for everyone, but it's just that--an assumption. Maybe you should be specific--say an ""unearthly flying saucer"" or some such--but even then, and even if we had a whole craft and not just some landing gear, how can it EVER be established that it would actually be ""unearthly"" even if our government revealed one?   But let's leave that aside. You are not appreciating the real difficulty. You make it sound as though everything would be self-evident if only we had a real flying saucer from another planet, but nothing could be further from the truth. Don't get me wrong--I'd love to see something that wasn't from here, but how in the world could I or anyone know that the other-worldliness of it is true?  While I don't like it when people try to phrase ""proof"" as though life were a courtroom, let's use legal evidence as an example. You're asking for a murder weapon, but that alone gets us nowhere. Moreover, the murder weapon is tied to something against which we can test it for verification (say rifling marks on the right caliber bullet to match a gun that caused a fatal wound). In your question, what is it that we'd test the craft in question against for verification? There isn't anything, ergo we could never know we have a truly alien craft from the mere possession of an object for which we have no reference. In other words, even if we had a flying saucer from another galaxy, we couldn't know this. There would have to be more."
UFOs,3dh36g,dute,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:02:44 2015 UTC,You appear to be filibustering by way of drawing me into a contest of the architecture and nuance of my question. My question is simple.

However, I'm going to take a different approach to your question. We may not have had intelligent visitors but there is evidence to show we had other types of life come to earth. There is bacteria that has been found that is almost completely resistant to radiation, something that scientists say could not have evolved on earth since it would've taken longer to gain this evolutional trait than any life on earth has existed. However, it would've been possible to evolve with this trait on a place like Mars. Again, there isn't 100% proof since it can't be proven until we find it on Mars or on an astroid.  https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2844-tough-earth-bug-may-be-from-mars/  Edit: And just to add to above, if we do find that a bacteria was able to evolve on another planet, then that greatly increases the probability that somewhere in this giant universe that semi-intelligent life does exist somewhere out there. They may just not have the capability or consciousness to travel in space."

UFOs,3dh36g,velezaraptor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:39:44 2015 UTC,"The original thought process behind the ET hypothesis is one of inductive logic, not observation of direct evidence. The argument goes that if the UFO reports exhibit intelligent control and behavior that is beyond human technology, then the ""occupants"" are most likely extraterrestrial. In other times or cultures, it might be considered that say a religious or mythological source is more ""likely"", but modern astrophysics and our understanding of abiogenesis lead us to predict extensive life in the universe.   Now when you don't discount witness testimony, there are also individuals who claim ""contact"" or ""communication"". I think these reports might be useful in aggregate, but discounting individual stories is probably justified.   Those are the two main types of supporting evidence some cite for the ET hypothesis."
UFOs,3dh36g,whatthefuckdoiknow,0,Thu Jul 16 15:25:49 2015 UTC,My question was about the existence of physical  material  evidence.   Your statement lends itself to Neil Degrasse Tyson's YouTube video on the argument from ignorance about UFOs:  http://youtu.be/NSJElZwEI8o
UFOs,3dh36g,aLiEn23ViSiToR,3,Thu Jul 16 16:12:41 2015 UTC,"Tyson's argument is a familiar straw man that is irrelevant. If Tyson had any understanding of the history of UFO reports and investigations, he wouldn't propose such silly arguments.  No sane person says UFOs are ""alien"" because they're unidentified (certainly not if you apply the principle of charity and look at the strong form of arguments instead of their weakest forms). The argument goes that if you accept there are reports that show 1) intelligent control and 2) cannot be human technology, then they are most likely ET in origin. The argument is logical, as long as the evidence for 1) and 2) are accepted. Tyson wouldn't accept the premise, so he'd reject the conclusion. But the logic is fine. If Tyson admitted the evidence, he would agree with the conclusion.   Anyway you say you don't want a debate. I just gave you the facts about why people believe these things.

UFOs,3dewo7,udlose,5,Wed Jul 15 19:01:11 2015 UTC,"On Monday, June 21, 2015, I witnessed what appeared to be a huge orange meteor falling rapidly downward and perpendicular to the surface of the Earth. I say meteor because it's rate of decent was very fast but its bright orange ""fire"" color was unlike the bright white color I'm used to seeing in a falling star. Its appearance resembled more of an military-style artillery flare but falling at a much faster rate of speed. (I'm in the military so I'm familiar with how these look)   The object then simultaneously began to become less bright as its rate of decent slowed to what appeared to be a hover. At this point, I realized I was witnessing a really unusual phenomenon so I ran approx. 15 meters to the house to retrieve my video camera. By the time I returned, the object was much less bright (approx. magnitude of Venus but still bright orange) and slowly moving eastward. I filmed the object as it moved slowly through the sky. Just as the object approached the treeline, from my perspective, it rapidly increased speed and vanished behind the trees.   Enclosed is the link to the video. I captured as much as i could in HD. Unfortunately, the most exciting part (the initial decent) was not filmed for reasons explained above. I was hoping someone might be able to enhance he video in a way that helps determine what it is.   I believe what I saw has a natural explanation, however, I am at a total loss for what it could've been."
UFOs,3dewo7,velezaraptor,3,Wed Jul 15 19:01:53 2015 UTC,"Hi, nice catch, did you report it to MUFON? Here is the UFO reporting page.  My observation: It did not appear to have normal aircraft lights, and it did not appear to fly like fixed winged craft, but more like a helicopter (Up, down, side, and hover) movement. Then at the end, the movement was a stretch to say it was a helicopter, speed and direction is not consistent with craft using a rudder.  Was there any sound?"
UFOs,3dewo7,popcan2,2,Wed Jul 15 19:45:47 2015 UTC,"I reported it to aerial-phenonmenon.org, which claims to look into such cases objectively. I am a naturally-skeptical person who demands a lot of evidence before I accept extraordinary conclusions. I don't believe this was ""little green men"" but what I saw is unlike anything I've ever seen.  My first reaction to the object was, ""that is the biggest meteor I've ever seen in my life."" The magnitude of its brightness and the speed at which it was descending was alarming. I was honestly anticipating an event like what happened in Chelyabinsk, Russia. There is no question in my mind that other people saw this object as well.   When it started to decelerate, I thought it might be an aircraft on fire dropping out of the sky (equally alarming). When the brightness diminished and it stopped falling, I ran for the video camera.  No sound of any kind occured from the object, that I could detect."
UFOs,3dewo7,alecz127,2,Wed Jul 15 21:44:03 2015 UTC,"people who say ""chinese laterns"" just have to look up actual chinese lanterns on youtube, they're dozens of videos, and then compare them to ""ufo"" videos to see they aren't even in the same ballpark.  now,  toy drones are a possibility,  but even they don't have the lift or power to take up high intensity lights 3000 ft into the air and put on an aerial display like the ones being filmed all around the world."
UFOs,3dewo7,ZWhitford,2,Wed Jul 15 23:49:04 2015 UTC,"I believe you saw something credible as I saw something similar in that it looked like a far away light capable of moving in different directions at will. When I first saw it, it was far enough away to look like stars, except they moved, and they appeared to move with intelligence, and it got closer, maybe as close as dipicted in your video. This was during a meteor shower last year, it wasn't meteors.  Anyone know of more incidents of UFO's that fit this description? They really looked like stars but no way were they."

UFOs,3dewo7,azeottaff,6,Wed Jul 15 22:14:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback, everybody. Nobody wants to debunk this object more than I, but I am reasonably certain it was not a sky lantern. Here's why:  When the object first caught my eye, it was plummeting out of the sky at a magnitude at least five times as bright as it was when I was filming. I would have believed it could have been a very powerful firework until it stopped descending altogether and started moving eastward. Chinese lanterns by the very nature of their luminance, ascend as they get brighter. (Unless they are on fire) If it was a lantern on fire, it would not explain why it stopped falling and started traveling eastward at a consistent altitude.  Here is some more information that could be relevant: When the object was falling, it did not have a smoke or debris trail behind it. I was just a bright orange flickering light.   There were no aircraft strobes or lights of any kind. The object remained bright orange for its duration.  Based on my knowledge of the area, I estimate the object covered about three to five miles from the time i started filming to the time it vanished behind the treeline.   The camera I was using was a higher-end home video camera. A Canon Vixia G20, which has a reputation for capturing decent HD footage in low light. No digital zoom, the lens, however, was at the extent of its optical zoom. I tried to keep the edge of the house in the shot as much as possible for reference.   No sound whatsoever came from the object."
UFOs,3dewo7,ura-sheep,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:21:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, especial the orange flicker. It flickers blue zoomed out sometimes but that can be the camera quality. The date is so close to the forth as well. I have set these off twice."

It would be great if it was a UFO though."

The mainstream media did an awful job reporting on this, never mentioning many of the key discoveries, no credits, and rather, highlighted crazy theories like this was alien ""fracking.""  OpenMinds summed it up quite well:   Although the media has picked up on the story, few, if any, have mentioned the investigation work done by Mistretta, Greenewald, and Murillo. By leaving out this part of the story, they leave out the fact that many UFO researchers are more than just wild-eyed believers, as the media often portrays.

UFOs,3daqds,ObjectReport,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:50:57 2015 UTC,"The bottom elements on the Flux Liner drawings look like, to me, an array of Biefeld-Brown lifter coils.   Most people incorrectly believe that such lifters require an ""air gap"", but this is a gross misunderstanding of the effect. In typical toy lifters made of balsa wood and aluminum foil, air acts as the lifter's dielectric.  But air's dielectric strength is only 1. Dielectric strength in the force equation of Biefeld Brown lifters is a multiplicative term. This means that dielectric materials with a greater dielectric strength yield more force.  Even something as relatively simple as aluminum instead of air as the dielectric would yield a more efficient lifter, and something like barium titanate with a much greater dielectric strength is even better."

UFOs,3dby0z,xenopsych,2,Wed Jul 15 04:20:16 2015 UTC,All we can do is speculate really. We can hope that in the future there will be some tech available that can get more information in situations like those described by OP. If they had some glasses with video capture for example.

UFOs,3dby0z,Crimfants,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:29:04 2015 UTC,"I have never heard of anything like what you describe, but we need lots more information. You haven't for example, told us how much angle the object subtended."

UFOs,3dby0z,Crimfants,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:15:10 2015 UTC,"that simply means how large it was in a relative sense. Since we don't really know the actual size or distance (human perception is easily mistaken, and how sure you are of your perceptions is not correlated with their accuracy), then it helps to know how large it appeared to be. We usually use the ""object at arm's length"" method. For example, if you held a baseball at arm's length, would it cover the objects?"
UFOs,3dby0z,Crimfants,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:56:53 2015 UTC,Thanks for the explanation. I'd say at arms length the whole formation was length of my thumb.

UFOs,3d9waw,Reignman34,5,Tue Jul 14 17:13:07 2015 UTC,"I think the recent willful self-discrediting of a few old UFO icons helps, as does the related revolt against the late of MUFON Conference speakers, who were not only same-old-same-old, but low credibility.  But, where, you rightfully ask are the new cases? Well, new, legitimate cases are reported all the time, but are rarely properly investigated. Most of these cases, however, fall into the usual categories that were reported as far back as the 50s or even earlier.  Note that we don't know what the unexplained residue of these phenomena are (and I use the plural advisedly), and the phenomena are so fleeting that we almost never get high quality data. Therefore, we really can't understand how they should manifest, or how often, or if they might go away altogether."

I personally believe there are other beings out there and some UFO reports are possibly related to these beings. I can only imagine how a non-believer, or people on the fence, viewed this documentary. After all, the guy behind the documentary was the leader of the Disclosure Project. You'd think his main priority would be to make believers out of skeptics, but the film caters to an extreme sect of the realm of believers —those lacking a healthy degree of skepticism.  SPOILERS AHEAD: It's not only the documentary itself that peeved me. It was the marketing behind it. They promoted the film as if it was a groundbreaking, paradigm-shifting revelation as a result of the tiny, humanoid ""ET,"" which was discovered. It wasn't an extraterrestrial, it was a human corpse with a rare genetic abnormality. The only documentary on the subject I recommend to open-minded skeptics is Out of the Blue. Period."

The Catholic Church being evil is not exactly a new meme, we've known about that for 1400 years! Kiddy diddling priests was a known thing for a long time, my parents used to warn me about priests when I was a kid. It just blew up as people became more conscious of civil rights and the church lost power. Abuse by weirdos in a position of power - especially closeted, forced celibate, robe-wearing weirdos - is a no brainer.   So is the paedophile stuff in British politics. It was an open secret that there were tons of sexual deviants because they kept getting caught! Or being found dead in elaborate kinky devices. Icke worked in broadcasting for some time so he would have heard rumours.  It's like throwing crap at the wall with Icke, eventually something will stick. You say enough stuff, eventually some of it will turn out to be close to the mark. And Icke was a fountain of claims of all sorts. It's hard to keep track.

""..is a no-brainer"" & if by ""we"" you mean humans as a collective (if not, then what do you mean?) then you are most likely incorrect.. until the past century, people have a long history of being uneducated sheep & believing whatever they're told to believe by their authorities & are taught that to believe anything else is blasphemous/ludicrous.. just sayin; kinda applies to the same discussion of inter-dimensional beings being a possibility... generally believed to be ludicrous right now..  Also, we are not as educated now as we will be in the future: the future generations we will be saying that the people of this century were uneducated morons for polluting the very air we breathe, destroying the very planet we rely on for life, ladening our food with so many synthesized chemicals then wondering why we get so ill ect.. just like we say about past generations being morons for e.g. using liquid mercury in ""health products"" : a total ""no-brainer"" -right?! this day & age, yes.. (hopefully you get my point?) & if we HAD known about it for so long, why has it taken so long for it to be proven to society as a whole? General mass education + advances in technology which have provided evidence is my guess, or else the only evidence is just human heresay.. Maybe what we need to prove the existence of interdimensional beings is another big technological advance, otherwise it's all still just human heresay as well? & again, I'm not saying Icke is an all knowing god, rather the opposite, just that we only know what we've either experienced so far or been taught to believe. If you can't tell I try to keep an open mind bc I recognise that I am not, & will never be all-knowing & ""we"" have been plenty wrong all throughout history, including the present.  edit/tldr: We don't know shit but we tend to think we know everything just BC we know more than we used to."

So it should have been no surprise when Sirius was a huge disappointment as well.  But Greer does (or at least, did) have his fans.  Sirius was hyped big time by Greer prior to it's release as a pay-per-view ""documentary"".  Much of that hype was over that so-called Atacamba humanoid, and that Greer was going to provide some ""Earth-shattering"" revelation about it.  As expected, the Earth didn't exactly shatter at the revelation that the Atacama humanoid was, in fact, very human.  The rest of the movie was really nothing new, either...just a bunch of rehashed content from previous stuff Greer already did.    Given Greer's propensity for the absurd, and his repetitive history of bilking good chunks of cash from gullible, wannabe believers...don't waste your money on this snake-oil salesman's ersatz tonics."
UFOs,3d6jkx,reticentbias,6,Tue Jul 14 01:00:36 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the reply! Some of that rings a bell, definitely remember the disappointment.  Didn't Greer host the disclosure project?

UFOs,3d6jkx,horse_architect,7,Tue Jul 14 01:10:07 2015 UTC,"No worries.    Greer's Disclosure Project you're talking about was certainly good for ufology...and that forum brought to light quite a bit of new and intriguing information and UFO cases, told by those who lived them.  It seemed the good doctor was on his way to UFO stardom.  But Greer soon started being all about the money.  And you don't get rich from ufology unless you're constantly promising new and more exciting projects...Greer raised quite a haul of cash for the development of his alleged zero-point energy device that was always seemingly ""right around the corner""...and that he needed just ""a little more time and money"".  That was almost ten years ago...and we haven't seen it yet.  Greer's ridiculous CSETI nonsense (sorry, I call a spade a spade) garnered him some extra padding in his wallet as well...charging upwards of $800 a person to spend a night with Greer and a group of other gullibles to contact aliens and inter-dimensional beings.    On his website, Greer posted photo of a ""light being""...which turned out to be a common woodland moth.  Another image allegedly was that of some being from an alternate dimension, complete with some headgear and boots...was nothing more than a double exposure, and the being was part of a nearby tree, matched perfectly side by side.  So although Greer may have started out with the best of intentions, it didn't take long before he went for the quick bucks.  There's an old saying...Fool us once, shame on Greer.  Fool us twice (and three times, and four times...)...shame on us."

We can't trust Penniston for obvious reasons, Warren seems unstable (I've heard him at conventions, he's .. questionable) and has changed his story several times, and even Halt doesn't have much but claims.  There won't be any data to present here, this again is just anecdote. Unless there are radar tapes or documents, this is worthless. Anyone can say anything. Without evidence there is nothing to go on. We don't learn anything. Unless we are especially gullible and ""want to believe"" - which is akin to the blind faith of religious fanatics.

You fucking debunkers don't have a clue and don't even think before you spew your fucking bullshit  ""The mission of the 81st FIW was to provide air defence of the United Kingdom. It performed this mission jointly with the RAF, working with No. 11 Group RAF Fighter Command. The wing was the first unit of F-86's assigned to NATO and the first foreign air unit to participate in the peacetime air defence of the United Kingdom.  In October 1954 the mission of the 81st changed from fighter-interceptor to fighter-bomber operations, carrying both conventional and nuclear weapons. The wing was charged with tactical operations in support of USAFE and NATO, with air defense as a secondary mission. To reflect this change, the unit was redesignated the 81st Fighter-Bomber Wing and traded in its F-86s for the Republic F-84F ""Thunderstreak"".  On 8 July 1958 Bentwaters was operated as ""twin base"" with RAF Woodbridge and as a single unit under the newly designated 81st Tactical Fighter Wing. Along with the 91st and 92d squadrons, the 78th Tactical Fighter Squadron was transferred from RAF Shepherds Grove when the USAF returned Shepherds Grove to the Ministry of Defence. The 78th TFS operated from Woodbrige, while the 91st and 92d squadrons operated from Bentwaters.""  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF_Bentwaters"

"" A cornerstone of the UFO believers’ case is that UFOs are reported by trained observers such as pilots and policemen whose eye-witness testimony would readily be accepted in a court of law. However, experience shows that they make the same mistakes as everyone else. (For some illuminating examples from the UK, see here and here.)  J. Allen Hynek, the pro-UFO astronomer who coined the famous term Close Encounters of the Third Kind, wrote in his book The Hynek UFO Report (p.271 of the paperback edition) that “commercial and military pilots appear to make relatively poor witnesses”. Hynek found that the majority of pilot misidentifications were of astronomical objects, just as they are for other UFO witnesses."""

UFOs,3d4unk,Crimfants,5,Mon Jul 13 19:18:14 2015 UTC,"well cause it was bright, seemed to be following us. it would stop its motion every so often. Infact it seemed to settle in the same section of certian stars. The light was big enough for an officer to belief it was a spot light at one point. but it would just vanish, then re appear in another direction. Or the fact that if you looked at it with our binoculars it was a glowing orange. Then when the sun came back up the bottom of the light seemed to be the same color of the ocean water...water reflecting sun so orangish."

UFOs,3d36db,whatthefuckdoiknow,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:25:56 2015 UTC,I saw the exact same thing a few years ago in GA. I was sitting on my balcony and those same lights were smoothly moving through the sky until they formed a triangle and just stopped. I ran inside to grab my camera so I could zoom in and get a pic and I came back just to see them lower quickly behind the tree line.

I'm not a photography expert so I don't know if those are artifacts or features. It looks like the formation changed a little. Good job taking pictures. Definitely worth reporting.  How long did you see them for and, if possible, how fast would you guess they were moving compared to something like a satellite?"
UFOs,3d36db,dazegoby,2,Mon Jul 13 11:28:32 2015 UTC,A few planes flew by while I was watching. These were definitely moving slow enough to get my attention. So slow that we didn't realize it until they formed a straight line over a new part of a building.  I have a few videos but do not know how to post from mobile.

It doesn't look white to me,....and it doesn't look like there are issues with the camera preventing the white to show up."

Seeing that the world's space agencies can track shit as small as a fucking tennis ball,they should know EXACTLY where those payloads are. I'm sure then everything could be confirmed by neutral observers,if the location was made public......seeing that the public paid for the fucking stuff.

There are thousands of objects, most of it debris and discarded stages. NASA does know where its payloads are, of course, but any shuttle debris has long since reentered."
UFOs,3d62kd,rdavisisme,2,Tue Jul 14 12:14:19 2015 UTC,I've never heard of it being white before?
UFOs,3d62kd,horse_architect,0,Tue Jul 14 00:00:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah,the debunkers think it's a cover from something from a shuttle mission,.....maybe a cover for a satellite?  It was a plausible theory when I first read about it,.....but since reading it I have looked at images of this object with more scrutiny,...and IMO I do not agree that this object is white....I see very little evidence of any white,or that a focus or shadow issue is making the object look dark.  It can't be part of Apollo 13,as the incident happened further out from the Earth as far as I know,....and it sure as hell wasn't going to backtrack from the debris field in space back into Earth orbit......so that is not it."
UFOs,3d62kd,ShivasIrons983E,2,Tue Jul 14 00:10:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think they claimed it to be a thermal blanket or some other panel?  Never mind that it was suggested to exist by Tesla in 1898, stories from the 1950's suggested it was there, the object (dark tumbling object) was confirmed by NASA in the 1960's and to be in a polar orbit, which was beyond our capabilities at the time.    From the STS-88 mission in 1998, it was photographed in a few frames.  It does not appear to be any configuration (not even a panel) of anything we put in space.  This same object also appears to have been captured by the ISS live feed in 2014 (see https://youtu.be/1yGLgXAfjAY).  The shape was very similar.  If this object did not have some sort of propulsion system (if indeed these reports are the same object, still to be determined) then it would have burned up in our atmosphere long ago.  I've seen many people try to debunk it, but I have yet seen any of the suggested explanations fit.  If someone provides a plausible explanation, I'm on board."
UFOs,3d1u8v,Dr__House,26,Sun Jul 12 21:01:52 2015 UTC,"I agree with the general direction of your argument. A couple of things I'd take issue with:  Prevalence of smartphones and other consumer grade photographic equipment doesn't help. Capturing clear, steady photos or video of objects in the sky, especially at night, is beyond the capability of such technology.  The ""why wouldn't they be cloaked"" argument is the same kind of argument you're criticising. Having one technology does not conclusively predict having another, especially when dealing with a complete unknown.   Finally, with pilots I think it's less an appeal to authority than a supposition that their training and occupation makes them better placed to identify genuinely anomalous aerial phenomena. They're susceptible to the same failings as anyone else, but should know Venus when they see it."
UFOs,3d1u8v,Hello-Operator,14,Sun Jul 12 22:58:40 2015 UTC,"I want to take your comment further as far as the HD Cameras go. I have a Galaxy S5, i can take a picture of my street holding still and when the picture is zoomed it, its blurry from the slightest movement. If I zoom in before taking the picture, the end result is blurry. Ever tried taking a video of something that isnt 15 feet in front of you? Its shakey as hell and if its far enough away, its more or less a waste of time.  This thing might take a great shot of your kids, but its a couple hundred dollar pocket computer that just happens to have a camera attached, not a $1200 camera whose sole purpose is to take amazingly detailed photos."
UFOs,3d1u8v,MahSelectah,2,Mon Jul 13 00:48:28 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Optically, these things are still fundamentally very crude cameras compared even to relatively old professional equipment, and usually they're operated by people with little to no understanding of photographic and video techniques."

UFOs,3d1u8v,turdodine,3,Tue Jul 14 09:52:46 2015 UTC,"On the camera argument I agree to a point. But at the same time, people 50 years ago were capturing what are apparently really convincing shots of alien spaceships and their cameras sucked ass. Our cameras are considerably better and we don't get jack shit. I think thats a point in favor of those saying ""we have just been hoaxing shit for a long time"""
UFOs,3d1u8v,i_poop_splinters,3,Mon Jul 13 06:40:07 2015 UTC,"Good point, although I'd argue modern consumer-grade cameras, certainly the ones in most peoples' pockets, aren't necessarily superior to older ones.   Setting aside the means of recording (i.e., digital vs. film), the optical technology in a 1960s SLR probably isn't fundamentally that different to a modern DSLR and is undoubtedly more powerful  than a smartphone camera.   For reasons of less automation in cameras, relatively lower disposable income to spend on relatively more expensive camera equipment, etc., we might argue that anyone in the 1960s with a camera good enough to capture shots of the sorts of things we're talking about would be a much more skilled photographer than modern day Joe Public with a smartphone.  But then, to your point, that dramatically reduces the amount of photographic ""evidence"" we'd expect to see from those periods.   So to some extent I'm inclined to think we've always had and still have the same problem: a relatively small number of people with the skill and equipment necessary to capture rare, unpredictable events."
UFOs,3d1u8v,Hello-Operator,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:22:40 2015 UTC,"I think also to some extent, there's a slight possibility that we've captured really good footage, but it's almost so good that it's immediately dubbed a hoax (by this I mean certain pictures/videos of aliens/UFOs. BTW, if you think all images/videos that allegedly capture aliens are bullshit, then why are you interested in UFOs? It's obviously just man-made craft or weather phenomena in your head). paranormal activity undergoes way more scrutiny than ""normal"" activity, with good reason, but I think this leads to more than a few false negatives."
UFOs,3d1u8v,doctor-girlfriend,4,Mon Jul 13 13:51:33 2015 UTC,"This is an almost insurmountable problem. If its poor quality, its shakey, blurry, a flare, a balloon etc. It cannot be clearly distinguished from any man made object, then have wasted your time and everyone elses with this garbage.   If its very clear, highly detailed and a steady shot that shows more detail than anything in recent memory, its CGI or a hoax.   Damned if you do, damned if you dont."

Especially because in all probability a really clear image would be of a stationary object at relatively close range.   BTW, if you think all images/videos that allegedly capture aliens are bullshit, then why are you interested in UFOs? It's obviously just man-made craft or weather phenomena in your head).   I don't think it's all bullshit. OP cites a lack of good photographic evidence in an age with unprecedented access to photographic equipment as a reason for skepticism. I'm pointing out a flaw in that position.    paranormal activity undergoes way more scrutiny than ""normal"" activity   More scrutiny in the sense of more people taking a view, perhaps, but not in the sense of quality. To my knowledge proper academic scrutiny has rarely if ever been brought to bear on the subject. I think that's partly because there's little evidence of a high enough quality to study, and partly good old academic orthodoxy."
UFOs,3d1u8v,Hello-Operator,2,Mon Jul 13 18:22:22 2015 UTC,"sorry, I wasn't referring to you in that instance, I was referring to people who see pictures of aliens and immediately call BS without any solid reasoning to back it up.

UFOs,3d1u8v,turdodine,17,Tue Jul 14 09:57:33 2015 UTC,"You've raised some good points, and I'll try to address some as best I can. Thanks for reminding us of the importance of healthy skepticism. We'll never get anywhere if we don't stay level headed.   •Arguments from ignorance. If your claim is ""I saw a UFO"" thats fine. Your conversation should stop there. It should not continue on with ""I saw a UFO, those are aliens from a distant world"". This is a common issue I'm sure a lot of you see all the time. Just because you don't know what something is doesn't mean its from a far away planet.   Happens quite regularly here and I agree with this point completely. It's a frustrating leap to an illogical conclusion.   •No HD video. Its 2015. We are all walking around with HD cameras in our pockets. Blurry videos and pictures of sightings are not at all acceptable and frankly, should be ridiculed. We have the technology to take HD video of these things. Where is it all? Nowhere. Just a bunch of blurry videos. Omitting the intentional fake ones on youtube that use super imposed ships from movies of course.   Not everyone has an HD-capable phone, although they are increasingly common. Those little cameras have weak optical zoom if any. Combine this with trying to film a typically distant object most often observed in low light conditions and the shock of beholding something the likes of which you've never seen... it's no surprise you wind up with mostly useless footage.   •Using negative evidence to support a claim. Blacked out information on a document is just that, blacked out information. it doesn't tell you anything. it might indicate they are ""hiding something"" but it could just as easily be names and home addresses and personal information. Negative evidence absolutely does not support any sort of positive claim.   No arguments against this one.   •Absence of technology when convenient. Don't you think beings that have the capability to travel to other star systems in very short periods of time would also have the technology to remain hidden so as to not be seen? If they're looking around, or abducting us or whatever then why aren't they cloaked? They have the technology. Its just convenient that they don't so we can take pictures of them?   Are they piloted by nonhuman intelligences? Do they come from somewhere far from Earth? Are they intentionally revealing themselves? Are they indifferent to being observed? We just don't have sufficient information to address these problems.   •False appeal to authority. I don't care if a Cop sees a UFO. I don't care if a pilot sees a UFO. They are both human, and both susceptible to making errors of judgement. I'm reminded of a story of a Cop chasing a UFO that turned out to be the planet Venus and he had been soo concentrated on the planet that he didn't even think much of the curved road he was driving down. All he saw was an object moving back and forth. But he's a police officer so we listen to him. Its a false appeal to authority. His sighting is no more ""good"" than anyone elses.   We should ask ourselves if there is any authority it is acceptable to appeal to. What about trained military observers or radar operators? What about cases in which pilots, radars, and observers on the ground all agree on their observations?   •Eyewitness testimony is the lowest form of evidence in modern science. This one shouldn't need much explanation.   It shouldn't and it doesn't. Sometimes all we can do is try to verify the character of the witness and research available data regarding celestial events, air traffic, and weather conditions at the time of their sighting to rule out the usual stuff. That still doesn't lead us to anything conclusive, unfortunately.   •Not accepting explanations no matter how well they fit, because ""I believe"". I'm reminded of a large city called Phoenix where a series of flares were dropped above a mountain range during a training operation. The flares eventually fell behind the mountain and disappeared. I admit at first this one was very interesting, until I saw a video of the mountain range imposed on the night sky. The moment the lights in the sky disappear is the moment they fall behind the mountain. It's clearly flares. Yet to this day thousands of people still call this sighting ""genuine"". Well, the flares were genuine, I guess.   It's my understanding the flares were a secondary event and that this sighting began before it was observed in Phoenix and that it ended in that location. There are claims people filmed it but those videos have never surfaced. On the other hand I find it a little odd that these flares caused such a disturbance and yet only one video of that has ever surfaced. Regardless of this particular event I have to agree that denial in the face of prosaic explanations because ""I believe"" has been a big thorn in the side of ufology for too long.   •Claiming to be open minded, but demonstrating profound closed mindedness. If you aren't willing to accept an explanation for something no matter how good it is. If you are only willing to believe its aliens, or its not a flare despite all the evidence then you are being closed minded. Being open minded doesn't mean believing in faeries or conspiracies. It beings being ready and willing to question everything, including your own personal beliefs. If you are not willing to question yourself, or consider that you might be wrong then by definition you are closed minded.   Hear, hear!   •Extraordinary claims with horrible evidence. Amazing claims require amazing evidence and should be held to that standard. Anything less should not be acceptable. Amazing claims made without evidence should be thrown out without debate. We have plenty of things to discuss already.   If scientists could stop laughing at UFOs long enough to study them seriously we might learn something. Until then it's up to us muggles."

UFOs,3d1u8v,fried_eggs_and_ham,14,Tue Jul 14 14:38:59 2015 UTC,"You're wrong about the Phoenix Lights being flares. Even from looking at the event's wikipedia page, it's easy to see that there were two major UFO sightings on March 13, 1997, the first of which was an large, unexplainable V-shaped object that appeared from about 8:00-8:45 PM, the second of which was easily explained as flares, occurring later than 10:00 PM. Most of the pictures and videos of the Phoenix Lights are of the second event.  To use a quote from a 2007 interview with Fife Symington, who was the governor of Arizona at the time and a former Air Force pilot, ""I'm a pilot and I know just about every machine that flies. It was bigger than anything that I've ever seen. It remains a great mystery. Other people saw it, responsible people. I don't know why people would ridicule it.... It was enormous and inexplicable. Who knows where it came from? A lot of people saw it, and I saw it too. It was dramatic. And it couldn't have been flares because it was too symmetrical. It had a geometric outline, a constant shape.""  And more generally on your post, you're right to say that 80-90% of all supposed UFO videos are probably faked, and all UFO sightings should be examined with the utmost scrutiny, but there still remains an anomalous 10% of sightings that are unexplained.  Edit: I'd also like to add that certain eyewitness testimony should be treated as credible, especially if it comes from an expert in flying objects, space, or information (a pilot, an astronaut, or a government man), and if the testimony is supplemented with additional data, such as radar evidence, photographic evidence, or an overwhelming number of witnesses. After all, what do these people have to gain by testifying that they saw a UFO, except widespread social ridicule?   As for the Phoenix example: did thousands of people just simultaneously hallucinate? I don't think so. I think that Phoenix is probably the best example of a modern mass UFO sighting, and that a very large, very real object was seen that night."
UFOs,3d1u8v,Deerhoof_Fan,0,Sun Jul 12 23:00:37 2015 UTC,"Can you provide a picture of this object? I can provide a video of the mountain range super imposed, showing the flares disappearing behind it. I would like to see pictures of that object."
UFOs,3d1u8v,jetboyterp,4,Sun Jul 12 23:32:43 2015 UTC,"He's correct about one thing...there were two distinct events on that particular night over Phoenix.  The ""V"" formation of a supposedly immense boomerang-shaped ""object"" at about 8:15-8:30pm, and the ""arc"" light formation with one light further back at 10:00pm.   The second event was exactly as you said...flares.  They were dropped by one of the pilots of the Maryland Air National Guard, who were returning from a night training mission, and one of the pilots had a few unused flares that were jettisoned prior to landing at an airfield behind the mountain range, away from Phoenix.   The lights of the first event were reportedly seen by Phoenix residents first, and by Tuscon residents 15 minutes later.  If that's the case, then this ""object"" was not some low-flying slow-moving craft as many alleged witnesses reported.  It would have to have been traveling at roughly 400 mph! Coincidentally, an A-10 top speed is 439 mph...and that's the type of aircraft the Maryland National Guard were flying that night.  Residents in the mountain areas also reported the sounds of jet engines coinciding with the first event.  There's your match."
UFOs,3d1u8v,Deerhoof_Fan,3,Mon Jul 13 00:16:45 2015 UTC,"I have been looking for a good photo of the first event ever since I heard about it, and this is about the best one I can find.  Unfortunately it's not that great, but note that the lights are very straight in alignment and appear to be angled as though they are on the flat bottom of a large craft.  Edit: I can't find any good photos of this event, apparently the one I posted is a simulation.  But, if anyone is interested in highly credible, legitimate testimony about unexplained UFO phenomena, including the Phoenix Lights, check out the documentary I Know What I Saw. It's incredible how similarly all the Phoenix Lights eyewitnesses describe the object. None of them treat it like a joke--they're all bewildered, or shocked to recall the event."

UFOs,3d1u8v,jetboyterp,-2,Mon Jul 13 00:19:41 2015 UTC,"I can't seem to find the one pic...it may have been a video clip tho.  Either way, I do remember that it didn't show anything you could really make out.    When thousands of witnesses came forward to report they saw some huge ""V""-shaped craft during the first event, yet none of them got a pic or video of anything even remotely resembling what they were describing, besides one pic that didn't show much of anything...it's really not that strange.  Because there was no huge ""V""-shaped craft.    They were A-10 jets on a training mission out of nearby Luke Air Force Base.  People in or near the city would only make out the lights...and due to the glare, the formation of jets high in the sky might appear to belong to one solid object.    The stars were ""blacked out"" not by a solid craft, but by the glare of the aircraft's lights as the jets flew in formation.  People farther outside the city, in the surrounding mountains where it was more quiet and had less light pollution, reported hearing the sounds of jet aircraft, and did not report any large single object...because the lights were obviously aircraft to them."
UFOs,3d1u8v,Deerhoof_Fan,3,Mon Jul 13 01:07:56 2015 UTC,"I don't buy the A-10 Warthog explanation for one second. When you have eyewitnesses uniformly describing a ""mile - long craft"" with a ""definite form"" that ""blocks out the stars behind it,"" it sounds like the furthest thing from a few small military jets. Plus, if it was a bunch of A-10's, people would have heard the military-grade jet engines. People described the craft as ""silent,"" save for the occasional person who says they heard a rush of wind or a whoosh when it shot off."

All credit goes to /u/Alx__ for compiling these. Sources for these quotes can be found at http://spaceflare.net. Many of them are on video, in context. For example, this one. It is recognized that quotes are not proof.   However: There is compelling evidence that UFOs are physical phenomena, not imaginary or hallucinatory. They are captured on radar that only detects physical objects, and perform feats not explainable by known physics. 90-95% of sightings can be explained by known phenomena, but 5-10% cannot.

UFOs,3d1u8v,orca9999,6,Mon Jul 13 04:04:23 2015 UTC,"I agree mostly with what you said.  One thing is the appeal to authority fallacy doesn't automatically mean that the people to whom they are appealing, are false/wrong. If their expertise is in the field they are speaking about, that can add significant weight to their argument as an expert.   For people trained to observe and accurately report their observations, I would give their observation more credence than say a random person drinking on the beach.  However I don't know if all pilots  or police are trained in such techniques. I believe military trained pilots are trained in observation.  But if one looks at their exact debriefing, they don't make claims about what they observed, just that they observed it and what it looked like, and how it behaved. I would absolutely believe this account as truthful.  Anything past this report is conjecture, and usually added by the person who reads or hears said debrief.  So while I would tend to believe a pilot who said they saw a sphere pass their aircraft, and it was traveling significantly faster than their plane, I would not jump to conclusions and say it was alien in origin without evidence."

Though I'm a tiny bit suprised that, judging from your first edit, the initial response wasn't that good. I admit that I don't participate much on this sub, though I do take a look at new stuff whenever it pops up. What I usually find in the comments is quite a healthy amount of scepticism, which is great. The few times I have commented on something it also was to express sceptical opinions or alternative explainations or in one instance even calling out others of a flaw in their thinking... and to my own suprise I was never met with any negativity.  From my very limited experience of interacting with this sub it has a pretty healthy attitude and isn't an echo chamber where you ""have to believe"".   Though about your arguments... the only one where I could really add anything is the appeal to authority one. What you say is absolutely true and should never be forgotten, however I also think that a certain selective circle of jobs could be in a position where their experiences hold a tiny bit more validity than those of your average ufo enthusiast who may sees what s/he wants to see.  A pilot, astronaut or scientist of certain fields is probably trained to be able to identify all kind of phenomena that they might encounter during their job, so when they see something they cannot explain it is a bit more mysterious than when someone who doesn't have knowledge on the subjects mistakes something for a UFO. Of course I'm not saying that just because a trained scientist or astronaut or pilot or whatever can't explain something means that it's a real alien ufo or whatever. All I'm saying is that these people might be in a better position to rule out certain possible mundane explainations.  I hope I somehow explained it well."

This is actually a good point but im going to bring it around from another direction.    So if there is an actual history of crashes and recovery of alien material then step would have been taken to limit what humans get access to. Humans will attempt to reverse engineer anything they can get their hands on. If you think about the implications of cloaking technology then it becomes clear that its something they don't want us to have.   The same would be true for travel which requires stationary systems not on the craft, like a portal.

It seems life evolves in the universe, and likely has on other planets as well, yet there is no evidence that is strong enough to be considered a smoking gun. Why is that? People spin this numerous ways, but the simplest explanation still seems the most likely: it hasn't happened... yet. There are many reasons to doubt even the strongest cases. It seems to me the  major difference between skeptics and believers is a willingness to consider eye witness testimony as fact.

UFOs,3d1u8v,ASK47,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:16:19 2015 UTC,"• Arguments from ignorance.   I’ve not seen this being used frequently, yet it sounds like something being stretched from dealing with a claim like a parent saying ""So you saw a monster in your closet did you? Go back to bed Jimmy” without looking, just went back to sleep all comfy.   •  No HD video.   There is HD video of UFOS, but HD is only HD within the parameters of the device.   • Using negative evidence to support a claim.   Evidence is evidence regardless of how much of it is usable. Like a forensic lab tech will tell you, any evidence is a godsend in finding answers. E.G. The Roswell Ramey Memo.  • Absence of technology when convenient.   Convenient…? Facts are facts; don’t read too far in to it for answers. What we understand can’t be used in determining why or if ET’s do anything including what we can see flying by.  • False appeal to authority.   This point is only valid if we are throwing them to the top of the list of credible witnesses (We’re not as far as I can tell). I would say that credibility is only as good as the methodology\training of the person speaking about the subject.  • Eyewitness testimony is the lowest form of evidence in modern science.   OK, so the Giant Squid didn’t actually exist by sightings alone, we needed to have one wash up on shore to fund research? What if someone “saw” a new species of monkey in the African Jungle, what then? “Sorry Joe, there’s no need to go on about a new monkey in the jungle because well, eye witness is the lowest form of evidence.”  • Not accepting explanations no matter how well they fit, because ""I believe"".   I don’t think it was the flares that got ‘em, it was the mountainous triangle flying silently overhead.  • Claiming to be open minded, but demonstrating profound closed mindedness.   I can’t say UFO’s exist no more than God exists but there is good chance there is both. Keeping an open mind about the existence of either will be hard to prove to me, but your stance seems very strong in the seat of being against UFOs, just saying.   • Extraordinary claims with horrible evidence.   So if I have an extraordinary claim but nothing but my word, you don’t want to know about it? I should just STFU? How does that help real claims, like the boy who cried wolf? Haven’t grown up from a world including disbelief based on claims? I wouldn’t want to live in North Korea, either."

UFOs,3d1u8v,ArdRi_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:08:44 2015 UTC,"In order:   I agree. The question is whether it's worth investigating, not whether we must believe in aliens. I have tried to film things in the sky at night with a smartphone and the result is not very good. It took until 2014 for a video of ball lightning to be produced, and that's an allegedly natural (and hence more predictable and viewable) phenomenon. I agree. I'd separate UFOs from all the conspiracy stuff. Speculating on the motives of aliens (if aliens exist) is not proof of anything one way or the other. Such technology may not be possible to the extent that you're imagining, or it might simply be useless. If UFOs are alien craft they may care a little that they don't disrupt civilization, but not enough to outright conceal themselves, similar to how we fly aircraft around indigenous / uncontacted peoples. Perhaps you'd like to cite your source for the cop who was driving on a curved road when he saw Venus. Did you take it from a Neil DeGrasse Tyson video? If so, where did HE get it? Are you sure this isn't the ""skeptical explanation"" for something like the Portage County UFO chase (which sure as hell doesn't sound like a good explanation to me)? OK, but if lots of people clearly and plainly see something, saying ""eyewitness testimony is of low scientific value"" does not tell us that it isn't worth investigating. Most of the problems with eyewitness testimony centre around small details being altered, things being flipped around or forgotten, but if you saw what many witnesses have seen, you would not accept this as an argument against what you saw. You're talking about the Phoenix Lights. The incident of interest actually happened before the flares, if you read up on it. The skeptical argument there is that the objects in question were planes. Everyone sensible agrees that the flares were flares; what many witnesses claim is that they saw something before that, and what skeptics claim is that they saw airplanes. It does seem a bit odd that flares were dropped right afterward--but I'm not a conspiracy theorist so much. OK I disagree. Amazing claims made in this quantity over this amount of time may not be cause to believe in something, from a scientific perspective, but they are perhaps cause to make a more concerted effort to procure the evidence.   I have read about this phenomenon a fair bit and I also know several credible people who saw things that could not be explained. And not just lights. I've driven to the sites where they saw them, interviewed them years apart, and while I agree that we don't have proof, I think that some of the documented evidence we have suggests that a small minority of cases may be worth investigating. Not everyone who is interested in this issue is a flamboyant conspiracy theorist.  There are some good points against the UFO phenomenon. But there are also a lot of things that are hard to explain. In my opinion there is enough evidence to justify better investigation; I agree that there is not enough evidence to assume that alien craft must have visited earth (but really, what is the worst that can come of everyone believing this and trying to investigate it?)"

I hope for his sake he didn't cross the line and fake anything - maybe those flares were just a coincidence feeding into his confirmation bias? If not, and he arranged it, then damn him."
UFOs,3d49t0,ASK47,3,Mon Jul 13 19:58:53 2015 UTC,Dr. Greer used to sound very reasonable back in the disclosure project days. Now he seems to be a new age nut job interested more in money and access than the topic.

UFOs,3czsft,starpwnage,2,Sun Jul 12 07:11:00 2015 UTC,"I've seen something very similar over Colorado, USA. I had the thought that they were satellites of some kind, until they began doing 90 degree turns. Satellites don't readjust their orbit 90 degrees, to my knowledge. There were probably 7 lights when they were most numerous."
UFOs,3czsft,BassBeerNBabes,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:05:50 2015 UTC,"That is right, and they certainly cannot reverse directions multiple times and go in circles. Satellites experience gravity, and fall towards the earth, but travel fast enough around the earth that the earth curves away from the craft. I know that is a pretty poor explanation."
UFOs,3czsft,BassBeerNBabes,2,Sun Jul 12 09:30:57 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty certain they can adjust their relative trajectory to some degree, but they have to maintain centrifugal force to keep from crashing to the ground or flying off into space. This means they continue rotating in the same direction after an adjustment."

UFOs,3czsft,rdavisisme,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:29:20 2015 UTC,"Seem similar myself, although usually just a single point of light I assumed was a satellite until they shoot off in another direction.  I've seen 2 orange points of light that were heading almost directly towards each other and both later made immediate and hard banks away in different directions.  One of the most interesting sightings for me was I had just watched the ISS go overhead one night (Sep 2014 around 9:30pm EST, don't remember the exact day).  About 8-10 minutes later, another object followed behind in the exact same trajectory and appeared to be slightly smaller but a bit brighter.  Checked and no scheduled launches to the ISS nor were there any known satellites due to fly over after the ISS.  As others stated, when these things make hard banks or at times even shoot off in another direction at an even higher rate of speed, they are absolutely not satellites nor meteors.  Not saying they are of extraterrestrial origin, but they surely are beyond the capabilities of conventional aircraft and are often at a ceiling of over 60,000ft."

UFOs,3cx7o2,Thatchers-Gold,26,Sat Jul 11 16:02:39 2015 UTC,I don't think the panic is an issue. It's more about the collapse of the economy and loss of world supremacy since disclosure would also reveal free energy.
UFOs,3cx7o2,logan_izer10,3,Sat Jul 11 18:50:43 2015 UTC,I'm loving these answers! But the only thing that hasn't seemed to be addressed yet is this part:   And what if a UFO made contact in a provincial chinese rice paddy or an angolan village? In this day and age you can be sure something that incredible would be on the internet almost instantly   Surely it'd be saved and shared pretty quickly?
UFOs,3cx7o2,ArbitraryCommentary,6,Sat Jul 11 23:25:28 2015 UTC,"There are a few possible answers to this, some conflicting.    1) There have been plenty of remote contacts, we just seem to hear more about the ones from South America. Africa's got a few as well. 2) Depending on the culture, some may not see it as surprising and therefore worth spreading to an internet likely largely unknown. Native Americans were notorious for stories about sky people, but just regarded them as a brother from another Mother Earth. 3) Priorities. When we go talk to China, we go to their leaders, their smartest people, those with influence, etc. Unless studying their culture, there's really no use for us to talk to the rice paddy farmers. Stands to reason another group coming to us would do the same. 4) The shock. These experiences are often very fast, and that combined with the deer-in-the-headlights syndrome that seems to be prevalent means even in areas with cameras, they more often than not probably wouldn't be used. I also wonder how much footage gets thrown away for being too shaky/fleeting/blurry/etc. 5) No one wants to be the village idiot. If you're the only one to experience something like this and you tell your village about it, even if you're the only one not being an idiot, popular opinion wins."
UFOs,3cx7o2,Seesawkarma,0,Sun Jul 12 00:53:14 2015 UTC,"Remote or not, decent data on a UFO is given credit equally. Much of the remote contacts have bad data for (essentially) no reason. You can't blame culture for not having evidence. Indonesians believe in ghosts and mysticism, they film it. Tongans/Samoans believe in ghost ships, they film and record them. I list these 2 cultures because I have been there and witnessed this. Their cultures of natural mysticism create intrigue and they want to get evidence and share it. Intellectual information is a priority to academics in any culture, they use back channels of academia to get information to spread, not politics. The second anyone sees something, They could easily contact 30+ friends to try and gather evidence ASAP. After less than a minute you could get enough footage to recreate a 3D version of the anomaly in both sound and video. If this is possible in a small town, then a city should never NOT have footage of UFOs. No one wants to believe and idiot, but fear of that wouldn't stop me if I thought it was important. And, in an effort to not 'be the only one' I would get more people to gather evidence. This often never happens because most of the UFO reports are solitary eyewitnesses who apparently do not care about evidence enough to try and get anything good. Either that or the thousands of reports so far have had an almost 100% failure rate on gathering evidence, which is highly suspect."
UFOs,3cx7o2,isosceles_kramer,3,Sun Jul 12 01:41:40 2015 UTC,"in regards to 4 and 5 consider the Phoenix lights incident. many people witnessed and recorded it, including police and other officials. but still most don't see it as incontrovertible evidence and Phoenix is a big city not a remote village. most sightings don't last long enough to gather 30+ friends but at least that many witnessed this event, still not convincing to most people."
UFOs,3cx7o2,Seesawkarma,-1,Sun Jul 12 14:22:01 2015 UTC,but still most don't see it as incontrovertible evidence   Probably because there is a more rational explanation. Flares and aircraft doing military training.
UFOs,3cx7o2,isosceles_kramer,5,Sun Jul 12 18:44:24 2015 UTC,"there are two phoenix lights everts, the second has been proven to be flares but the military has never admitted to any tests running at the time of the first event and all known military aircraft were grounded according to released documents. ufology inherently deals with the unknown so again if you're not going to even be open to the possibility until you can touch it with your hands you are wasting your time here."
UFOs,3cx7o2,Seesawkarma,0,Sun Jul 12 19:15:26 2015 UTC,Statistics also deals with the unknown and making accurate predictions of the unknown. Why does statistical data not factor into ufology? Statistics are a good way to make hypothesis based on small data sets like ufo reports.

I'm sure a Chelsea Manning type would leak something clearer than a pixellated grey blur   Manning didn't have access to any high-security stuff.

UFOs,3cx7o2,Seesawkarma,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:35:00 2015 UTC,"Sir, I consider everyone delusional to some degree. And I was making speculations of the exact same probability. This fear of these speculations is a conspiracy in and of itself inside this community, and it annoys me. I wish to address these important points. So I do, I do not require your permission.   Why do UFOs require 'belief' in your words? I believe they should require only evidence? Am I wrong? Why does the invocation of real evidence send everyone running for the hills in this sub?  What is with the whole idea of the UFO trying to stay as a mythological construct? If your alien dream cannot withstand a bit of scepticism, then how real can it actually be?  I am here for the truth. That is all. I will not accept (on mere suggestion alone) that these things exist without evidence. Neither should you. Otherwise it can only be wishful thinking. I am quite happy to postulate and hypothesise all day long, but to take the next step in realising these assertions, we need evidence. Otherwise what purpose can these hypothesis have?   Suggesting that a cube may be a sphere is certainly possible. But to utilise that idea it needs evidence. Sure, you could decide it is a sphere - but once you try to use it, the unseen characteristics of squareness create problems. In your sphere accepting mind, these problems are strange at first, and you gather evidence to discern why. Ah ha! All the evidence based upon the presumption of sphereism points to one thing, something is trying to make you believe in cubism! Preposterous! It is clearly a sphere! They say it does not fit through a square hole, but when you think about it this way (cuts off sides), it fits perfectly (reattaches sides). See they are liars!   Sure, maybe you want that. Maybe you are happy with the fantasy and do not wish its holes to be pointed at all the time becasue it breaks your immersion. But that is the nature of delusion. So it, of course, is your prerogative. You can be you, but I will be me. We can still converse on the topic and most importantly we both learn to understand each other by this communication.  For if you and I (with so minuscule differences in our thought) cannot converse about the most basic elements of reality, what hope is there for us to be able to do the same with an alien species?"
UFOs,3cx7o2,isosceles_kramer,2,Sun Jul 12 18:04:24 2015 UTC,"evidence does exist, if it isn't convincing to you until you can physically walk onboard an alien ship that's your prerogative but coming in here to call everyone delusional isn't searching for truth, it's a condescending dismissal of an entire field of serious research on unexplained events. i don't know of any ufologists that form their opinions on a whim with literally no basis as you seem to think."
UFOs,3cx7o2,Seesawkarma,2,Sun Jul 12 18:54:58 2015 UTC,"I don't need to    physically walk onboard an alien ship   but it would be nice. When I said I think everyone is delusional, I referred to the inherent differences in subjectivity that is the source of all human interactions. Not just people in this sub. And it seems to be a poorly placed jab at the reality of being a species of subjective beings chasing objectivity.   However, chasing true objectivity (the truth) is certainly possible while claiming everyone is delusional. Pointing out an innate delusional perspective on every human being is hardly condescending to scientific research. It is basically the reason why science exists.   My problem is correlation (specifically statistical). I have yet to see it used correctly in regards to a positive UFO sighting. And you can stand there claiming authority, no true scotsmans or strawmans or whatever you need to. I only offered that considering delusion should always be a part of analysis, nothing more.   If you cannot see why two people of opposing views should not discuss their differences, then perhaps I should at least stop talking to you."

UFOs,3cx7o2,iBalls,6,Sun Jul 12 19:16:53 2015 UTC,"Sure, everyone references or quotes the 1960s Brookings' Report - ""The implications of a discovery of extraterrestrial life."" i.e. the collapse of the three pillars of society: religion, financial system and government, with the added aspect of global panic.  Aliens have made contact with a wide range of cultures around the world, from farmers (I take it this covers your 'chinese rice paddy') in desolate and rural areas, to native tribes, scientists, the military and world leaders - MUFON and various authors/ researchers have documented these encounters.  Since the 1960s and the Brookings' Report, intelligence agencies have updated their assessments: 1) based on the technological superiority, the aliens aren't here to eliminate us 2) contact with us, isn't recent - it's been a long term engagement by them 3) the aliens are interested in our DNA, as a means of gradually evolving us 4) that it's by our decision that their presence will be known; this doesn't translate as ""contact,"" when admission by governments deem it's time  Point 4 is important. At any time the aliens could've made themselves known, regardless of how governments felt - they haven't. Are they complicit in the silence and cover-up? Yes. The conclusion is they'd have to be.  So, the 1960s Brookings Report is outdated. What's holding back admission of an alien presence? Why 'cover up definitive proof of extraterrestrial life?'  As an alien race, there's no way you'd interrupt a race that's engaged in multiple wars, genocide, etc. There's a good chance we'd use their technology advances to kill each other, if not attack them. Other than disable our nuclear weapons, which they've done repeatedly, as proof that they don't want us to really eliminate ourselves, their role remains mute in the big picture.  It's all about timing. Part of any advanced race is the ability to take care of themselves, as well as the environment they're living in. Sure they can step-in and stop wars, cure cancer and fix the atmosphere - we as a people, haven't learned the most important lesson; that we're one. We need each other. We need to show that we can respectfully work and trust each other, to clean up the problems we've created; to get our house in order.

Robert also captures reports of nuclear missiles, on test flights, intercepted by aliens. Link.  Robert Salas is another outstanding source of information.  All this information has been captured by multiple researchers from Timothy Good, Nick Pope, Linda Moulton Howe, Richard Dolan, Nick Redfern to Stan Friedman. Robert Hastings and Robert Salas have presented their work at the National Press Club, as part of the  Disclosure Project, along with a number of very interesting witnesses, while under oath. The material dates between early 1990s and present time - it's not like they've been hidden or kept away from the public; it's common knowledge to most researchers and those who can perform a Google search, even a YouTube search.

UFOs,3cx7o2,SkullCollector,0,Sun Jul 12 00:37:44 2015 UTC,"8/1/2011 9:45ish at night. I was watering my lawn at night, and happened to be looking at the stars already, and already in the right direction when I  saw something. It felt completely random, and like if I had looked two feet in either direction I might not have noticed anything.  I saw a bright, white, horizontally (think kitt car style) strobing light begin to rise from the trees near lake hartwell. It slowly rose to a height just above the tree tops (like something out of a b-movie) and then suddenly fell to where it first appeared. It then began slowly rising again and got to the same height just above the trees when two things happened simultaneously: an orange orb appeared from nowhere just below and behind the strobing white light. At the same time, the strobing white light began moving Southeast by instantly 'relocating' from place to place. It did not fly, it would instantly blink out in one location and blink 'in' in another. All while maintaining the same strobing rhythm, and while the orange orb slowly, and perfectly parallel to the ground, followed along behind and below it.   They kept moving Southeast, following the corridor of the lake until I could no longer see them (within 4 minutes of first seeing them).  Within no more than three additional minutes of seeing the 'UFOs' the sky was full (6-8?) of what I assume were normal aircraft that seemed to be looking for the UFOs. They had very normal looking red and white wingtip (or outrigger if helicopter?) LEDs that implied normal aircraft in the sense that they banked when they turned. They came in from every direction and zeroed in on the first location that I saw the strobing light. They all made numerous tight turns around that location while also making larger clover leaf like turns around the entire area as if they were sweeping a wide area looking for it/them.   After maybe three minutes of the red and white LEDs circling around, they all left heading northeast (in the wrong direction btw).

How far away from you were they?  Are you sure you were not drugged, dreaming or aren't simply making shit up? Have any of your neighbours seen this? Are there any reports on MUFON or other media on this event?"
UFOs,3cx7o2,SlackR76,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:12:33 2015 UTC,"Here's the link to my MUFON report. I called and spoke to a MUFON person first and then filed on line later. When I filed online I was able to verify that there were other reports from the same date and area filed.   No I wasn't drugged, dreaming, or making shit up.  I don't know why there was no sound. Stealth would be a good guess.   I couldn't tell if they were planes or helicopters. They banked smoothly and gracefully. When the last two left paired up though, they looked a lot like fighter jets to me.  My guess on distance is that they were less than a quarter of a mile away (directly over lake hartwell). The UFO's were never very high up in altitude, while the red and white LED craft stayed much higher as they circled the area.   None of my neighbors saw it, but like I said though, If I hadn't been looking in the right direction, I wouldn't have seen it either.

UFOs,3cx7o2,Thatsnotwhatthatsfor,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:15:05 2015 UTC,"It would be advantageous to be the first species to interact with humans on a global scale. The first species to step forward would have a more favorable position in future cohabitation of species. So if we are being visited by multiple species and there hasn't been one species to come forward globally its probably because they don't have the ability and/or authority to do so. There has to be some agreement or governing body that keeps everything in place. If any one species landed somewhere, literally the entire galaxy would know who broke the rules.   If we are talking about the interaction between two species why would we think the inferior species would be in control of said interaction? If we were to conduct dialog with ants who would do the questioning? Select the time and date of interaction? Any information regarding ""them"" can be controlled by them from within our society simply because they are way more advanced. They could have an A.I read the worlds information daily and then disseminate/translate it. They could have simulations running of our society which could help them to manage how disclosure occurs.   Its probably some sort of inter-generational agreement between humans and alien civilizations that preclude the ability for there to be ""snowden ufo files."" The consequences could be severe if the agreement doesn't reach its natural conclusion which I think could be a set date in time and/or a certain milestone. The new people who govern the secrecy have their own reasons to not leak.  We don't know the total jurisdiction of the great intelligence apparatus. What do 40,000 people do in a single building? The small amount of people who have privileged access to UFO info could very well have their own monitor at the NSA."

People can react violently and unpredictably when it comes to matters they don't understand.   I think that IF the government knew anything, they'd certainly keep it under wraps in the interest of public governance and order. You can't tell me that if aliens landed tomorrow that the world would unite in harmony and understanding. We'd have people busting out their guns, mass suicides, Westboro Baptist would start making ""God hates Aliens"" signs, and the scene would become an unmanageable cluster-fuck. People would be fearful before they would be receptive to a benevolent extraterrestrial presence. I don't trust stupid people en masse, and I'm sorry to say that I don't believe we have enough intelligent people in our midst to competently make first contact.   I don't think there are any cabals or reptilian overlords, I DO think we are being studied and observed, but any intelligent beings observing us likely see what's happening in Syria with ISIS, Nigeria with Boko Haram, and seeing monthly anarchy in whichever US city is burning from riots, and they understand that we aren't really, truly ready to make contact.   I don't trust humans, and there is no way that I'd fly millions of light years to make contact with savage animals who are all too eager to kill each other. I think they are biding their time, and checking us out. I don't think their job is to protect us or show up with deliverance when/if we need help.   If I was a decision maker, I'd never tell the public about extraterrestrials, nor would I say anything about a comet or an asteroid if it was on a collision course with earth.

We would already have the cures for diseases coming from super powered versions of the Watson computer that is already making waves in healthcare.   Once we have our own answers to many of the requests people would currently have for a civilisation more advanced than our own, then and only then will disclose come."
UFOs,3cx7o2,popcan2,0,Sun Jul 12 04:24:48 2015 UTC,"There are a bunch of explanations scattered all over the thread, but I'll just hit the simple button: It would shatter the Status Quo.  ""Economy"" as it is now would collapse, inevitably. Think on it like this, we rely on oil for power. Anyone entertaining thoughts of perpetual motion machines, cold fusion, reading up the remnants of Tesla's research on Radiant Energy and all in all, looking for any sort of alternative power source is seen today as - much like anyone who utters the acronym UFO - a tinfoil-hat wearer who is clearly insane and useless. Come disclosure, even if just a most simple form that says ""we have reason to believe extraterrestrial entities or equipment have been in contact with earth."" What does that say? There's some form of propulsion and power generation that is far more efficient than what we have now. Even if we're never told what it is, we would know it is there and all efforts would be made to find it and master it. The oil barons can't have that. Not if it's outside of their control, if something is to replace oil it has to be their initiative to retain their position. Public information of the existence of something to be found would send every researcher to the drawing board, they wouldn't be able to control who figures it out and how said researcher decides to act on it. And it doesn't matter whether or not what said ""next"" form of energy is; knowing it's there is all it takes.  Another facet of the economy problem lies in the fairy tale circle - err... Stock Market, I mean. See, the Stock Market is the backbone of how paper money moves around, and it works basically on the notion of trust. Someone trusts a company to be lucrative and gives it money - profit comes, the person withdraws their money by selling their, now more expensive, shares to someone else who believes the profit will continue. Yes, there are mathematical models, I'm well aware of that. But once you insert a huge variable of ""unknown"" technology, then suddenly nobody has a clue which branches of the economy will thrive and which will be rendered obsolete. Risk raises to mind-boggling highs, investments cease, suddenly there's no money fueling the capitalist engine. Think of the worst market crash you can, scale it up worldwide. At that point, if we don't have the new technology, we'll need it as soon as possible to dig ourselves out of the rubble we buried ourselves in.   The way I see it, though, religions will probably not be affected too badly. Some will, sure. But for the most part I do think that most religious leaders will take a stance of declaring aliens to be fellow sons of god and cousins to mankind. Even if only to keep peace while they, themselves, tear their hair out trying to make sense of what's going on. In that case, the transition to a new paradigm of us not being alone in the universe wouldn't be too turbulent - we'd already have enough turbulence in other areas of life.  And ultimately, what is most strange in such scenario, to a mind that's used to the melodrama of earthlings, is that war would be stupidly pointless. Fighting against a race that can muster the energy and method to perform interstellar, intergalactic and/or inter-dimensional travel would be like trying to cut a mountain with a foam sword. If we haven't been fried by magnifying glasses like ants so far, it's not at all likely that anyone watching from outside the human society is interested in getting us dead. And if we can't war, the government is suddenly at a loss for what to do. What, after all, can politicians do other than plot conquest? (Look up your history if you think I'm kidding. :) We may be out of the age of invading for territory, but economic subjugation 's been pretty hot since last century.)   So, with all that thinking, I'm back at the simple point of it all, the end of the Status Quo. Anyone who is in a position of perceived authority prior to disclosure would not be guaranteed to stay there after it. And for many, it's actually extremely likely that their influence would plummet and never recover. Just don't think the government is thinking on the well being of the citizens - so what if there could be a decade of famine due to broken economy? They have their nuclear bunkers to wait it out, common people be dammed. What's holding them back is that when they crawl out of their oyster they'll no longer be Mr. President and Lord CEO and will have to figure life out just like everyone else - and they're terrified of that. So, if there's any reason for a cover up, it's fear. Simple as that.    To address the questions directly, preservation of tech is a catch-22. Suppose the US has some NewType Alloy; the US wants access to the amazonian forest and Brazil denies. US launches a NewType drone south to take control of Brazil. Every other country watching will swarm for data on the NewType metal and work on replicating it - US military tech advantage is thus negated. Yes, governments hold their big guns concealed, but keeping something like that for a rainy day means you can only count on it to block a single raindrop. Much like the power source argument above - researchers just need to be certain it exists to go looking for it. And when everyone knows and no one is scared of ridicule for looking into it, SCIENCE!!! gets done.   Discovery for discovery, and leaks, well... It's not as if something of this magnitude is kept in some intern's drawer in some slow office. Conclusive, undeniable evidence of ""something bigger"" would require physical evidence - meetings in live camera, samples of metals we don't know how to forge, devices that can be demonstrated to do things in ways we don't consider. Or just shaking hands with ETs and hitchhiking a saucer for a trip to the beach. It doesn't matter how many documents are leaked, it's ""forgery"" and it falls out of spotlight. Photography ""can be edited,"" videos ""came from some Hollywood studio tech who knows his special effects."" Someone talking? They're senile! Attention whore! Haha, as if. --- Nah, whatever it is that would be a leak, it has to be verifiable. Which is why I think a lot of people who might have access to juicy data doesn't bother leaking it, for a leak to work, it has to be something anyone can ""try at home,"" so to speak. Or, of course, big, official, in-office heads of state going on record with ""welp, suddenly aliens."" Something that the government itself can't disregard. And good look convincing people with the secret that the president deserves to know, because, yes. The absolute head of state has stuff over his head - something that big can't be trusted to someone who will only be in the house for about a decade, at most. Nope, it has to be a lifetime commitment, elected officials have no need to know about it. And we wouldn't, and haven't, accepted anything that doesn't come from anyone other than elected officials.  For the third question, it's similar. It can happen, it is likely to happen far more frequently than any of us here is officially considering. But do we believe when someone says they've had an encounter? Do we accept footage we are offered? The Phoenix Lights is a marvelous example of this. Dozens of recordings, from dozens of perspectives and dozens of different kinds of people. Accounts ranging from stoners to well grounded police officers, all corroborating the same event... And we still say it's bullshit. Well, a lot of us. Speaking for myself, knowing what it would take to ""prove"" it, if I had at nice tea party with some alien and were to know, personally, all of it to be true - I sure as hell wouldn't steal the dude's ship just to make a point. It'd serve as proof, yes. It'd also be very poor form. So, if I was the Chinese rice paddy of the example, unless I was asked to deliver a specific message, or exhibit some sort of device, I probably wouldn't bother trying to show the world such a truth of the universe.     My take on how to approach the problem would be to reach out for the aliens directly. And no, I don't mean ""leave it to SETI"" I mean that, if there's intelligent life here and around here, they likely monitor our communications and events. And all thought points out that if they want to show up, there's no politician's word that can stop them, so, let's just keep asking. :) Let's stop waiting for the government to lead this waltz and start dancing ourselves - and dare them to keep up.   Seek contact by ourselves, instead of waiting for arbitrary authorization from someone else. :)  (No, I'm not sorry for the wall of text.)

UFOs,3czlxr,prentle,3,Sun Jul 12 10:51:23 2015 UTC,Even the good channels don't always get it right but they're sincere in the effort. At the very least I can say none of these use visual effects fakery:  https://www.youtube.com/user/ldsmess  (compilation show)  https://www.youtube.com/user/lasvegasbronco    https://www.youtube.com/user/seeingUFOsPA/  In general you should be more inclined to trust channels that do not have a heavy interest in constantly cranking out videos for profit.

UFOs,3cy3cl,jetboyterp,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:15:39 2015 UTC,"I think it would be wise of them to at least delay the feed a few seconds to reduce risk of showing something classified (not necessarily UFOs), but I'm not sure there's any way to verify my suspicion."
UFOs,3cy3cl,whatthefuckdoiknow,3,Sat Jul 11 21:59:59 2015 UTC,"For sure, nobody is going want classified satellites being shown.  But any such objects in Earth's orbit are going to be tracked very closely...and know it's exact position and orbit every moment of every day, where it is, and what it's traveling close to.    There's a whole lot of man-made stuff up there.  Check out this site:  http://stuffin.space/   The ISS is in a relatively low-Earth orbit.  It's barely in space at less than 250 miles up...and needs to be traveling at roughly 17,000 mph to keep that distance and prevent Earth's gravity from pulling it back in.  So it's not going to be coming in close contact with most satellites anyway...much less top-secret ones."
UFOs,3cy3cl,jetboyterp,2,Sat Jul 11 22:28:00 2015 UTC,"I agree. Their positions are known to the relevant parties and probably are in different orbits likely much further out.  There's a shocking amount of stuff flying around up there! The odds of anyone seeing something, not to mention recognizing, something they aren't supposed to see are incredibly small.  I can hardly fathom how difficult it must be to avoid the prying eyes of China, Russia, and others."
UFOs,3cy3cl,whatthefuckdoiknow,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:53:27 2015 UTC,"I can hardly fathom how difficult it must be to avoid the prying eyes of China, Russia, and others.   Reminded me of part of the events occurring towards the end of the Cold War, where the US and the Soviets agreed to reductions in nuclear ICBM's.  The US would remove entire missiles from silos, drill large holes in them, leave the silo doors open and the hole-filled missile lying on the ground nearby for a certain length of time.  The Soviets would be able to take pics via their satellites to confirm that these missiles were indeed destroyed.   That was the late 1980s/early 1990s...today a satellite can read the mint mark on a dime laying in the palm of your hand.  And you'd never even know it was happening."

UFOs,3cw08b,AlwaysBeNice,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:08:27 2015 UTC,the idea of telling the news makes me nervous.. i dont know :(
UFOs,3cw08b,Seesawkarma,4,Sat Jul 11 22:59:28 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you may have been watching aeroplanes/helicopters lining up for approach or (if not near an airport) perhaps a holding pattern.   A series of lights = a series of aircraft using the same flight vectors. Slight changes could also apply as the holding patterns could cover a few different altitudes.  Lights fading out and back in = headlights on aircraft in a loop. As the aircraft turns away from you, their lights fade out, as they come around to face you again, they fade in.  Different colours = the orange, yellow and red are possibly normal plane or helicopter colours. If these were not commercial aircraft, then they could have a strange configuration and look unusual. Military aircraft often have red, orange and green and blue lights.  But, from your photo it is hard to tell. They could be chinese flying lanterns or aircraft with weird lights. It should not freak you out, humans have hundreds of different flying things it could be, rule them out first to find out what they are. But RULE them out using facts, do not just assume they are not aircraft first.   Edit: Become a student of them, draw a map of their movements, time them. Use something like http://www.flightradar24.com/ to see what commercial aircraft may be close by (this will not show all of them) or use http://www.liveatc.net/ to search for the air traffic control tower of the nearest airport to hear about what traffic is in the air. You could see if any aircraft are near your 'ufos' and hear if they report anything about them to the control towers or other planes."
UFOs,3cw08b,Hanosandy,2,Sat Jul 11 11:26:13 2015 UTC,"This was my initial conclusion as well.  Without ruling this out 100%, sounds like you've got yourself a commercial airport within 100 miles of you, and you are on one of the approach/departure paths for a run way at that time of day.  Usually later at night airports (especially older airports) will only have 2 runways open for use to save on resources.  One for landing, one for take off.  USUALLY these are more or less perpendicular and on difference ends of the airport.  I live out in the country with two airports within 50 miles of me.....this happens to me all the time, but I still scan the skies every night.  Hope this helps.  [edit:  I'd also like to point out that usually people like the person above me, and myself, who give detailed descriptions of what you are likely seeing are not calling you ignorant by any means.  Reports like this are helpful both to fellow sky watchers and to people who provide critical analysis of reports like this.  Always remember everyone, that something being unidentified (UFO) to you, someone else might be able to easily identify.  It doesn't make one person or the other more intelligent than the other.  I have experience at MUFON and I sure as heck don't expect most people to be able to readily identify craft or phenomenon in the sky with accuracy and ease.  Reports like this are a good thing.  Critical analysis of reports like this is a great thing.  It just helps build a case for the UFO phenomenon, while also lending it credibility since most are able to easily be debunked.  Remember if people on here have a hard time debunking it, or you aren't convinced with their explanation - report it to MUFON and NUFORC.  Call your friends or family in the area around you and ask if they can see what you are seeing - have them take photos.  In your photographic evidence you present make sure there is a point of reference (objects visible in the near field that can help provide a relative sky position with accuracy) and note where you are standing/facing while recording this evidence.  That's all.  :) ]"
UFOs,3cw08b,Seesawkarma,2,Sat Jul 11 15:10:05 2015 UTC,"I'd also like to point out that usually people like the person above me, and myself, who give detailed descriptions of what you are likely seeing are not calling you ignorant by any means.   Thanks, I often get perceived that way because I am an academic and a sceptic. I require a certain amount of factual statistical evidence to change a belief in something. And, whether or not I believe OPs account is a bona fide UFO or not, I will always accept it could be possible.   The main difference in the two thought patterns are that I start off not believing it by default, then use evidence to increase the chance I believe in it. A true believer simply starts at the other end of the scale, full belief, then uses evidence to decrease the chance they believe in it. Both work, but as scepticism is a more natural approach to life (for me) I favour it.   With so many hoaxes and eye witness only reports I believe that when humanity does make significant world changing contact many will not believe it. ""Wolf"" has been cried so many times that people will not care. But we will need data, information, statistical analysis, physical evidence and justifications just to make humans realise that this one is real. So, everyone watching UFOs should be religious in recording as much info as possible about sightings, with both the intent to study the data scientifically and the hope that scientific research will hold the truth."
UFOs,3cw08b,Hanosandy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:52:53 2015 UTC,"I did analysis and field investigation at MUFON for a few years.  Some say 95% of reports can either be identified or are just plain hoaxes ... I would say the actual percentage is close to 99%.  To fit in that 1% I need multiple independant witnesses or evidence sources (usually with one or more of the witnesses being highly credible).  I would need to cross check with all available radar and flight data (harder to get military data after the stephenville, tx flap).  Now I firmly believe their are cases out there that point to ET craft (whether entity occupied or not is another question) coming to our planet, or that at least some of the world's militaries are a hundred years or more advanced than we are led to believe.  The amount of abductee cases, especially those reviewed by Bob Hopkins, are also convincing that something is going on.  Approaching anything ""unbelievable"" in life with a skeptic's point of view is the best way to get to the real evidence.  People who want others to believe this phenomenon is real (whether ET or not is another question) are shooting themselves in the foot by not taking the skeptics approach.  If we present garbage evidence we look like garbage ourselves.  I want to strongly note, that providing cases that have even the most remote chance of being a bona-fide UFO to the community is a great thing! - and I mean that fully.  If I have to review 1000 cases and only one turns out to be a true UFO...then I feel like it was worth it.  It's like Mulder on the X-Files says ""I want to believe"" on his poster in his office... and like that I want to believe, and I do believe there is a phenomenon, but for others to be convinced that it deserves much more scientific research and attention - we have to come at it and get the facts.  I am glad there are others like me.  It's frustrating - that is for damn sure - but so damn rewarding when you and your colleagues find even just that one example in 5 years that just makes you go ""wow, now that's hard to shake off.""  (sorry coffee hasn't kicked in and this is more of a rant than anything, mate)  [edit:  I need celestial, and weather data too.  Usually a field investigation verifying accounts is the best way to gather terrestrial data, while analysis on a computer or some phone calls can provide the rest.  I want my kids to be to know in their lifetimes if this is a current and past reality or just ordinary happenings - and what it all means about humans and the cosmos as well.  I also hope everyone in this community reads and understands where and why people like me approach this like I do, and understand we are all on the same side...I think most people on earth are on the same side of this great debate of our time.]"

UFOs,3cw08b,aDeadSoul,2,Sun Jul 12 00:22:43 2015 UTC,It's a small thing but should be noted. You would actually like someone to identify the currently unidentified flying object. The term debunk is more about identifying something as a hoax or disproving a current explanation.
UFOs,3cw08b,LovelyDay,2,Sat Jul 11 14:42:46 2015 UTC,"Common misperception you note there, but the two often go hand in hand by most.  People who 100% true to be hoaxing should be shamed and dismissed as quickly as possible.  Pointing to someone as a hoaxer when they are really providing something that helps the community by either providing evidence or showing how to identify similar sightings as identified objects/phenonmenon is a really bad deal, and should not be done.  If the provided evidence is not edited, thank the person and provide analysis to help our community. Agreeing with you, just adding the associated connotation that comes with each type of report, and STRESSING not to call people hoaxers unless they are clearly just pulling our chain.  Most people who post events on here just truly want the truth about what they saw.  They want to be affirmed as not being insane.  They want to help affirm most of our sanities.  :)"

UFOs,3csgcb,fueno,11,Fri Jul 10 12:07:38 2015 UTC,"If you analyse the books from a compositional point of view, they are absolutely written within the framework of story narrative. That doesn't mean that the stories aren't true, but the presentation is definitely informed by Strieber's professional skills. He creates drama and suspense artificially. Today the books read fairly poorly as the technique of horror fiction written from first person has advanced dramatically, and Strieber's own fiction was never outstanding.   As to his credibility, the books contradict one another, and Strieber is obviously a fantasy prone individual with limited ability to differentiate between objective reality and the intensely imagined. The core story remains the same, but over time Strieber has changed details. He himself admits he is an unreliable narrator, and even relates that he claimed for years to have been at the University of Texas when Charles Whitman went on a shooting rampage, when he (Strieber) could not have been there.   He is a mystic, his stories are steeped in the urge for spiritual awakening, the recombination of fractured psychological elements with the divine. He was raised a Catholic, deeply interested in witchcraft and ""new age"" philosophy, and a member of the Gurdjieff Foundation in the USA for years, this is based on an esoteric philosophy of altered consciousness.   Strieber has also uncritically backed many UFO hoaxes and unreliable UFO claimants over the years. He is credulous. His core story is deeply influenced by the ""Intruders"" narrative created by Budd Hopkins and associates, with whom Strieber was involved early on in his experiences. He was present in groups where abductees discussed their accounts, and Strieber's narrative was unquestionably influenced by this.   While I believe he is genuine in his claims, I don't believe they are objectively real.  TL;DR - Whitley Strieber is not credible."
UFOs,3csgcb,CaerBannog,8,Sat Jul 11 04:32:47 2015 UTC,"He's often said he doesn't really understand who or what is interacting with him. His accounts are often bizarre and don't fit into the neat ET hypothesis paradigm, which to me, increases his credibility.  The issue is that he has, indeed, monetized his experiences. He writes new books every few years when he suddenly remembers or encounters something new. That doesn't disprove his claims, but it could be a conflict of interest.  Regardless, I consider COMMUNION a must-read for anyone interested in the subject."

UFOs,3csgcb,aDeadSoul,15,Sat Jul 11 00:57:10 2015 UTC,"Excellent, something I actually know about!  Whitley Streiber has actually made comments on his horror/SciFi novels which came out before Communion; regarding readers challenging the validity of his claims because of his ease at writing fiction.  I'll paraphrase because I don't have the book currently with me, but in his novel  Cat Magic, which came out 1 year before Communion, Whitley mentioned that some of the figures/beings in that novel (and many of his prior works) are actually created from his subconscious' attempt at rationalising the ""unexplainable occurrences"" which had allegedly happened to him.  In Cat Magic, one of the characters meets faeries in the forest; the description of them being grey, short creatures of immense intelligence, something that resembles the beings in many of his novels.  Whether the faeries are directly based off Whitley's claims to be abducted by Grey's is questionable, of course, but it at least provides a bit of foundation as to where he claims some of his horror novel ideas ultimately come from."

UFOs,3csgcb,ParanoidFactoid,6,Fri Jul 10 14:01:19 2015 UTC,"I don't discount Strieber because he's trying to make a living relating his alleged experiences, or because his pre-Communion fiction seems mostly to be allegorical explorations of alien-ness. I think he has had inexplicable things happen and he's trying to work them out in public. Some of his ""high strangeness"" episodes outside the alien abduction paradigm (apparent dimension / parallel world glitches, etc.) are especially interesting."

UFOs,3csgcb,socialite-buttons,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:56:52 2015 UTC,"Well, I was going there some years before he wrote the book. It was when I read the book when I realized I knew exactly where he was talking about."

UFOs,3csgcb,Gohanthebarbarian,8,Sat Jul 11 10:57:36 2015 UTC,"My take is the guy is suffering has gone through some traumatic events. He has some interesting stories. Whether he has had contact with aliens, dimensional beings or disruptive programming by humans is hard to tell. He comes across as someone who was initiated (in occult terms) either too quick or by accident and something didn't go right."
UFOs,3csgcb,Onyyyyy,5,Fri Jul 10 17:24:55 2015 UTC,"Since this is Reddit, I'll start off by saying that, unless I specifically say ""I BELIEVE HIS STORIES"", me defending Mr Streiber has nothing to do with my own personal beliefs, just humanity's amazing ability to rationalize (and as with most paranormal cases), and then convince themselves that nothing out of their comfortable paradigm could possibly exist.  I like how people ask for ""proof"" and then shit on anything even possibly credible because the source monetizes their efforts.  If he was a poor guy, people would discredit him because they would say he is trying to make money because he is poor. If he was even more popular/rich than he is, people would just think he is crazy and write him off anyway.   I just can't get over the fact that prior to his release of said book he was a horror novelist.   So only people with no appearance in the public eye, low income, low charisma, and low confidence can be credible when dealing with paranormal claims? What is your point here?   I have always felt that he was exploiting the UFO subject and that he wanted in on the money.   Going public with a paranormal/fantastic claim somehow unequivocally means that if you try to make money to support your life off of your experiences, they are false? What data are you deriving this conclusion from?  I bet I can show you 20 examples of people who have been involved with true, verified tragedies and events that have profited from their experiences for every one person who is a fraud and has become rich from their fallacies.   That is not to mention that most of his stories are terribly outlandish.   This is not a good tool to sort out what is true and what isn't. What is your reasoning behind using this method to determine what you think is credible? Are you suggesting that an event has to be something that you find plausible for it to be considered legitimate?  Because I am not somebody who has had in depth conversations with people, doctors, loved ones, and enemies of Whitley Streiber, and I am not a certified expert in any field in regards to the different tests and evaluations that Whitley has undergone in the past few decades, I can not say whether I believe him or not.  So what if he was a fiction writer? Reagan was a fiction actor, dozens of politicians were fictional movie stars. America is full of elected officials that come from fucking Hollywood. This point is completely erroneous.  So what if he profits? Do you work your job for no money? If you were ""abducted"" and went public and people wanted to pay you money for book deals and movies and interviews, you'd honestly say ""no, I'd rather be dirt poor and look even CRAZIER!""?.  Yes, most people in the public eye claiming anything fantastic are bullshitters, Whitley could be too. Or he could be telling the truth.   Let's stop with the bullshit reasoning and get down to what actually matters.  More than a couple of professional people with public reputations have had experiences that they have talked about at Whitley's Upstate New York Cabin. What happened there? I don't know. Assuming it was anything is fucking stupid on your part.  He states over and over that he has no idea what/who these beings are. He speculates wildly, though.   If it IS some mental issue, thousands of people suffer from it, and it deserves to be researched in a serious and thorough manner.  I also think it's silly to have these discussions if any party is going to be fervently attempting to frame ideas in a traditional human construct. IF beings exist that come from somewhere and do something to us, it is excruciatingly obvious it is well beyond our current understanding of our reality. We are the equivalent of an ant-hill applying our ant-logic to explain a human child with a magnifying glass vaporizing our friends. [7]  //spelling"

UFOs,3csgcb,mzziz,3,Fri Jul 10 13:50:55 2015 UTC,"I've been following his career since communion, read most of his books. Have even been an off again on again subscriber to his website Dreamland.  I've found that he's a very opinionated man who's trying to make a living off his life's work and experiences. With that said, I have no reason to believe that he isn't exactly as he sells himself. A man who has had some extraordinary experiences far outside of what can be considered ""normal"". Who is desperate to make some sense of his situation through his own writing and researching into these matters. I don't think he is purposely trying to mislead, hurt or scam anyone. However he is his own person and everything he says should be weighed as the arbitrary opinion of one man."
UFOs,3csgcb,Luna_C,3,Fri Jul 10 19:28:36 2015 UTC,"I was reading his books before Communion came out. He's a good author, there's no doubt about that.  As time went on, and I got older and wiser, it became more clear to me that Whitley is a pretty strange guy.   My personal belief is that he believes what he's telling everyone. I personally do not believe he was abducted by extraterrestrials, and Whitley himself has said that the whole thing could be in his head.  I don't think he's exploiting anything, but he's a very odd person. Some of the stuff that he is into is patent bullshit, IMO."
UFOs,3csgcb,Smoothvirus,3,Fri Jul 10 20:48:29 2015 UTC,"I worked on a couple of different projects with him over the last 10 years. He doesn't have any credibility. He's an okay guy, but I've seen him convinced that some msft paint-level photoshop was 100% an alien craft. He might believe some of his stories, but I don't believe one of them. Don't like that he hides behind ""I'm not exactly sure what they were"" to leave room for any direct questioning. Anne is odd, and he always insists that she's involved in everything."

I wrote, ""Strieber writes that, despite his terror, despite being 'violently treated,' despite surgery to remove an implant, despite not knowing who it is we're dealing with, his experiences have on the whole amounted to 'a student-teacher relationship ... focused on my intellectual, emotional and spiritual growth.'""   Stockholm syndrome?"
UFOs,3csgcb,breathin,2,Sat Jul 11 05:56:37 2015 UTC,"I've known Whitley for a long time. I think the way to look at this, is that author's, accountants, bartenders, lawyers, whomever, they all have experiences. And, just because he wrote stories prior/after, doesn't mean he should be discounted.  I, for one, am proud that he is a friend of mine and for so long. Has he TRULY experienced what he said he has? Unfortunately, only he knows for sure. But, we really shouldn't discredit him because he is talented enough to write a fiction story."

UFOs,3csgcb,ObjectReport,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:17:53 2015 UTC,"It's hard to know where to stand with Whitley. I've read a handful of his non fiction books and really enjoyed them. I have the same doubts regarding his credibility as other commenters here voiced while I read through his books, but ultimately I figure even if I have a lot of questions over the validity of his accounts, his books are still nonetheless super enjoyable. No one theory behind ufos and possible extraterrestrial or whatever beings really fits in with one another 100% so I don't really mind his really wild and out there stories of alternate realities, reincarnation and the undoubtable occult/esoteric angle.   In many ways I feel that even if there will never be solid proof of alien/whatever existence or intervention, the core concerns of many abductees/experiencers is still largely the same: ecological crisis and extinction, the failure of global capitalism, egalitarianism,  to lessen the gaps between science and the spiritual, and ultimately to learn to live peacefully with each other and create a better world.   Regardless of your personal beliefs regarding ufos and aliens I think these are universal concerns that many people have, and they are things we really all need to consider."

UFOs,3cm9wl,SquizCat,68,Thu Jul 9 00:34:27 2015 UTC,"OK, I'll translate it.    We begin this series of photos with the one that is surely the most impressive. It seems to have undergone a different treatment (?) than that of the next three photos. Is it a ""cigar"" that has been hit by a missile and is exploding at the surface of the water or a UFO that is coming out of the water and ready to fly? Note that no inscription appears on the original document in our possession.  Here are the photos that came with the letter. We present them in an arbitrary order that seemed logical, however it is maybe not the most sensible since we don't know if it the craft is flying, going out of or going into the water...It is worth mentioning that one can read in transparency on three of the photos in our possession, copies of the originals that apparently came from an American military laboratory: On the left on top: OFFICIAL PHOTOGRAPH. NOT TO BE REALEASED. CT On the right at the bottom and hardly legible, a part of it having been erased because of time: Unauthorized Disclosure Subject. Security Certificat. SSN 674. Criminal Sanction. High definition photos are available on our CDR (Top) On this photo, we identify without a doubt a triangular-shaped UFO. It seems to be in trouble. (Bottom) If the order that we have chosen for these pictures is correct, the UFO here seems to now go sideways before plunging into the ocean...  The next five photos show an egg-shaped object of large dimension that falls into the ocean. These pictures seem to come from another laboratory, SYGMA, about which we know nothing.  Do these photos present a single and same event or are we dealing with two different events? (Top) The craft, which looks a lot like the one in the first picture, seems to be in trouble. Is it on fire? Does it come from the depths of the ocean or is it headed there? Despite the fact that its form perfectly resembles the typical ""cigar"" shape of UFOs, it is still impossible to distinguish more details of its structure. (Bottom) According to the letter from our ""anonymous contact"", the submarine was equipped with an analog camera, thus explaining the image overlay (or double exposure?) of the visible graduations (I'm assuming they're talking about the double crosshairs.) Too beautiful to be real, this ""cigar"" photo? We don't know, it might be the ""banana peel"" that would be used to discredit the other pictures of the dossier...Who was our anonymous informer? A reader of the magazine or a source wanting to share their secret? In any event, if we haven't been able to find these photos on the internet, maybe a reader will give us some information that has evaded us..."

However, after some research, it is possible these were naval target balloons, and the USS Trepang was conducting a weapons test of some kind. As indicated and referenced/sourced above, “From 22 February to 22 March [1971], the nuclear attack submarine operated beneath the northern ice cap, conducting extensive tests to provide data for her weapons systems, as well as carrying out scientific experiments concerning the movement, composition, and geological history of the cap itself.”  I searched the Library of Congress, and came up with a few examples of Balloon Carriers. They do have a resemblance. Here are the examples (it should be noted that the balloons in these photographs were photographed between 1910-1915… a considerable time difference between this case and these photographs.

Which also begs the question why the hell you would do this in a submarine? May as well stick the launcher on a DD and send them to do it, given that everyones going to know where you are from all the racket you made getting up there with your noisy ""aftermarket"" deck launcher dragging through the water the whole way."

I'd certainly say that's a more likely explanation for any art we find that depicts something that wasn't around at the time. We depict things in art that don't exist all the time, what's so unbelievable about someone from the past doing it too?  People in the past weren't idiots.

(Think the whole Annunaki story about humans being genetically modified for mining gold or the Prometheus movie story) 4:  They are using this planet as a DNA farm and extracting needed resources for themselves.

UFOs,3cm9wl,RobotJiz,2,Thu Jul 9 09:05:44 2015 UTC,"Its ok RobotJiz I thought they were plausible ideas. Really if we are talking about a species of intergalactic or interstellar capability their objectives for visiting our planet could really be anything from simple observation to something entirely foreign and unexplainable to us with our current perception of the universe. I for one hope that if we experience an open and public ""first contact"" that the species is a benevolent one interested in kindling our development and welcoming us into a new era for humanity. Obviously this is best case scenario and there is just as much potential of any other motivation for contact occuring. Trouble is UFOs are not synonymous with extra terrestrial life. Photos like this are very easy to interpret the wrong way and glorify out of context. We can only speculate and enjoy the mystery while it remains one of natures great secrets.

In these much clearer photos I can see that after it is shot and starts burning it loses it's shape somewhat and then crashes into the water. The splash of water is from the heat.  The image that looks like a mirage might be the cigar shaped balloon photographed from some distance.  The small object might be debris from the balloon floating around in the air.

If we look at the last set in reverse order then it seems like the camera knew there was going to be an event. I am highly skeptical about our ability to really do any damage to advanced alien ships. So if we are seeing multiple events from different cameras with objects ""being in trouble"" then I think its possible this was all testing. This could very well be our reversed engineered versions of advanced ships and some sort of testing in the arctic.   Why test in the arctic? Actually it makes sense if you think about all of the spy sat coverage other nations have. All eyes are on the southwestern U.S. There are some very remote regions that probably aren't monitored or thought to be testing grounds."

UFOs,3cm9wl,Wired_Wrong,34,Thu Jul 9 23:48:13 2015 UTC,"You can't use an image that was printed (rasterized, probably offset print) and scanned/photographed afterwards. The compression artefacts that are used for an analysis of this type will get rendered unrecognizable by the DTP process before printing. And as these images seem to be taken with an analoge camera the process to temper with them would also be analog which would make the compression analysis of the image useless even if you had access to the original photos.   LPT: Don't use this tool on images that are not of digital origin!  Believe me, i'm working with image restoration and stuff for more then a decade and to me these images seem pretty legit. But we can never be sure without analyzing the original negatives!  Edit: Explanation for what you see in the analysis. The compression artifact analysis looks for differences in the compression marks in an image that are left by various processes (Saving, Editing, Reducing Size...).Example: If you put an object in photoshop on another background image these marks wont match. This is what these kind of analysis looks for an highlights. Now if you use an printed image for this there are no compression marks left visible that can be analyzed (except you print the picture with an incredible high DPI Ratio which is impossible with industry standarts) so the algorythm pics up at the rasterized dots that are used to print the image with the printing plate. (Additive Color Mixture (RGB) needs to be converted to Subtractive Color Mixture CMYK) A lighter color has less dots and a more colored area has more dots. (Note on a monitor its the opposite, all lights on = white, all off = black) These differences are what is visible in the analysis image."

I don't think there has ever been anything anywhere close to what the revelation of ET or ED life (or whatever creates the UFO phenomenon) would be, and that we have no way to imagine what the outcome would be.   Things like the War of the Worlds broadcast are not reliable precedents. It was framed as an invasion of Earth by hostile ET forces. That's the closest thing we have to disclosure in history, and it isn't grounded in reality and thus is not a good example. Sure it's good example for an alien invasion, but I think we can safely say that if we haven't been invaded yet, we probably won't be, until we are space-faring and pose a threat to other civilizations."

UFOs,3ck35h,moosho,0,Wed Jul 8 16:43:06 2015 UTC,"There's an old saying:  Be careful what you wish for...  Let's say, for the sake of argument, ET's are visiting Earth, and governments from around the world are keeping a lid on it.  If the ET's intentions here are positive and good, why keep them a secret?  But if the ET's intentions are negative and bad, that's something probably best kept from the general public to avoid panic, anarchy, and a complete breakdown of society.    Other reasons for ""non-disclosure"" would include classified aircraft development happening, where it's best that people think it's some UFO.  The SR-71, the Stealth bomber and fighter, and likely other top-secret aircraft have been responsible for quite a lot of UFO reports the past few decades.  Better that America's enemies think it's a UFO rather than American advanced-technology military aircraft.  Bottom line:  Non-disclosure could be justified, if ET's are real and they're here with malevolent intentions, or if UFO stories are a cover for covert experimental aircraft.  They may also be here for reasons nobody knows for sure what they are...and if that's the case, non-disclosure can also be justified for the same reasons.  Non-disclosure is harder to justify if ET's are real and they're here with benevolent intentions."

UFOs,3cnva7,undercoversausage,0,Thu Jul 9 17:42:07 2015 UTC,"With all due respect, Stephen Colbert isn't exactly a reputable source here, and the website linked, to ""Conservatives for Peace"", I've never heard of...and I'm a conservative.    I'm certainly not saying that some companies don't profit from being defense contractors/suppliers...they certainly do.  As for the Iraq War, I still believe it was the right thing to do...although mistakes were made in the aftermath of the fall of Saddam's regimes for sure...from Bush to Obama.    But I'm getting OT, so I digress.  I do question the numbers you've provided, and a rudimentary google search doesn't show me anything remotely reputable as far as a source goes, that's all I'm saying.

UFOs,3cnva7,jetboyterp,2,Thu Jul 9 18:02:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think Colbert was inaccurate and his fact checking team is pretty good. If you want to get right up close to the truth, it would probably be in your best interest to do some research and retain some of the facts.  fact: There are 435 congressional districts across 50 states. fact: The military spending within the US for 2015 $598.5 billion (yes, that's half a trillion dollars) fact: congressmen get donations from all sorts of companies, a good chunk of whom are military sub contractors  You could dig, but you will find that in each and every district, tehre is a business that employs people that produces good for the US military branches.  I don't understand how you, an American yourself I presume could even come close to doubting this when you look at a half a trillion dollars getting spent in the economy. if that went to even only a few districts, they would be the wealthiest districts on the planet lol. But they spread it around. Even the shoelace suppliers get a taste and no one will vote for anyone who is going to shutter a military contractor for altruistic reasons because of job concerns. It's pretty clever.  there is literally a deluge of information. Put the onus on yourself to understand if that is your goal. You know, as opposed to sitting there in doubt of what you're being told."
UFOs,3cnva7,undercoversausage,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:36:52 2015 UTC,"Again, this is all getting way OT for a UFO forum...and that's my fault.  But of course, I have to respond :P  Yes, I'm American.  Yes, you're defense spending number is relatively accurate...you may have actually come in a little low.  And for totals, discretionary spending...separate from Defense Dept. spending...would increase the total as well.  As a percent of GDP, military spending the past fiscal year is nearly equal to that of 25 years ago.    And yes...you're right about the ""shoelace"" thing, because the total budget for Defense does include things like military housing, letterhead & stationary, light bulbs, phones, computers, and like you said....shoelaces.  So it's really no surprise that there are various companies from coast to coast providing these things.    But none of that can be connected to some sort of ""military cover-up"" of anything, or evidence of some greater ""military industrial complex""."
UFOs,3cnva7,jetboyterp,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:10:35 2015 UTC,"Depends. If there is technology that is being reverse engineered or re-engineered etc, then it is either a cabal in the military, a cabal in the government or both that is not releasing the information in regards to the question of what are the ufos. An I mean the real ufos, not the thousands upon thousands of youtube hoax videos and claims etc. But the known stuff, the stuff that pilots report, the stuff that pilots shoot at etc etc.  If Raytheon doesn't let anyone know the government gave them something to develop, then, that is a military industrial complex cover up AND a military cover up.  I understand the need for secrecy, but I do think the need for disclosure is important as well."
UFOs,3cnva7,undercoversausage,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:30:40 2015 UTC,"That's a big ""if""...at least as far as reverse engineering of alleged ET craft is concerned.  But if we're talking innovative and advanced terrestrial technology being developed for the govt. by defense contractors like Raytheon, outside of any actual ETs/ET craft, whether they exist here or not, it would perfectly normal and expected that defense contractors working on classified military projects be required, by their contracts, to absolute secrecy.   And again, the US defense budget, whatever it is, doesn't necessarily mean there's a cover-up going on, either by the govt., or by defense contractors, or both.  There's nothing out of the ordinary with that scenario, and no reason whatsoever to ""disclose"" these projects to anyone.  It wouldn't be about keeping secrets from American citizens, but from America's foes and potential foreign enemies.    You obviously know the need for such secrecy...but knowing that, it should also need to mean there wouldn't be...and shouldn't be...any disclosure over classified military projects.  That's not a ""cover-up"", it's simply ""classified"".  If there's actual ET craft being reverse engineered by some govt. faction, however secretive, it would also be necessary to keep that information under wraps...for the same reasons...keeping that information out of enemy hands, among a host of possible other reasons.  Bottom line:  The defense dept. budget has no absolute correlation with any sort of cover-up, by the govt, contractors, or both, of anything other than normal and expected classified projects."

UFOs,3cnva7,gnatty_dread,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:23:03 2015 UTC,"The cover-up is international in scope.  Somebody put a LOT of effort, time, and research into creating the fraudulent MJ-12 documents.  The official story of Roswell changes every few years and some of the versions are really outlandish.  Who creates these stories and why does the media pass them along without verification or independent investigation?  How is it possible the media didn't pursue and investigate witness stories at the Disclosure Project's 2001 National Press Club event?  Guy says, ""I saw satellite photos showing buildings on the moon"" and it doesn't even make the news.  How can someone make that kind of claim at the National Press Club and go unchallenged? Doesn't that demand a reasonable explanation?  Fairly credible sources like NUFORC are missing critically important historical mass-witness event reports.  How does that occur?  Certain historically-important dates aren't even in the database."

You didn't include the perhaps most likely of alternatives; no cover up at all as there might be nothing to cover up.  I am sure your government and military cover up loads of stuff, but that doesn't mean there are aliens visiting earth for example."

The Full moon only takes up half a degree.  If you held an object at arm's length that was the same apparent size, what would the object be? A beachball, a basketball, a grapefruit, a baseball, or something else?"

It was not completely above the horizon, I could only see the top 60-70% of it. Yes I really mean it took up 90 degrees, a full moon would have been 1% of this thing. It would probably have been somewhere between a beachball and a basketball from an arms length, closer to a beachball to be totally honest. It was massive dude."

There were times the setting Sun looked incredibly huge and red, due to refraction of light in the right atmospheric conditions.    Are you sure of the 9:00pm-ish time?  The Sun would have long set by then in February.  Perhaps it was the moon, and it's reflecting of light at a low angle in the right atmospheric, and having the same effect as the Sunset.  The dark splotches you noticed may have been the dark areas on the moon."

The capsule shaped craft resembles the apollo capsule during an ocean landing or drop test. But the other ones look very interesting.   We are certainly not seeing the entire view of the photos as most of them seem to be shot only showing the center of the photo and it appears that they are from a book or leaflet.

UFOs,3ch6zf,wyldcat,5,Wed Jul 8 00:46:02 2015 UTC,"That second photo is really, really interesting. Judging by the wave pattern, the object is coming out of the ocean at a fairly high rate of speed."

I wondered if that one photo directly in the cross-hairs shows a torpedo strike, but of what?  And there's no indication of an explosion, only water spray.  If that isn't an explosion the object has some serious mass.  That photo also seems to belong to a sequence that includes this photo.  You wouldn't fire a torpedo at something in the air."

UFOs,3ch6zf,doucheposse,4,Wed Jul 8 05:44:43 2015 UTC,"When I first posted these photographs, I noted there was something very Zeppelin-like about some of the photos, but, unlike the actual Zeppelin’s, it did not have a carrier for the occupants.  However, after some research, it is possible these were naval target balloons, and the USS Trepang was conducting a weapons test of some kind.  As indicated and referenced/sourced above, “From 22 February to 22 March [1971], the nuclear attack submarine operated beneath the northern ice cap, conducting extensive tests to provide data for her weapons systems, as well as carrying out scientific experiments concerning the movement, composition, and geological history of the cap itself.”  I searched the Library of Congress, and came up with a few examples of Balloon Carriers. They do have a resemblance. Here are the examples (it should be noted that the balloons in these photographs were photographed between 1910-1915… a considerable time difference between this case and these photographs. Could the same technology have been used more than 50 years later?): http://www.theblackvault.com/casefiles/arctic-ufo-photographs-uss-trepang-ssn-674-march-1971/  (Under the section of ""Possible Explanations"")"
UFOs,3ch6zf,doucheposse,2,Thu Jul 9 17:15:45 2015 UTC,"Yet the Trepang, for all intents and purposes would not house, launch, or maintain the targets (far to inefficient).  It would have been testing the weapons systems in use or observing for effect.  So it's the vessel that's responsible for the targets that you are looking for.  That could be hard to find insofar as the vessel could have been privately subcontracted, and would have no military record as such."
UFOs,3ch6zf,jetboyterp,2,Thu Jul 9 20:10:47 2015 UTC,True -- but it may be easy to prove that these targets were launched by another ship.  I already requested the ship logs and crew roster for the Trepang for this timeframe. I will see what I can come up with.  It was already documents in one of the sources I listed that they were testing the weapons systems -- so that could be a supporting clue.
UFOs,3ch6zf,MickDaster,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:16:44 2015 UTC,"It might also be a clue as to what weapon system they were testing.  There are various instances in which UFOs have been sighted over nuclear facilities, etc.  What if the Trepang found something (We can speculate portal or underwater base) and agitated it, then these ""tests"" were ""performed"" to cover up some other activity?  What if the inflatable targets are meant to be in that series of pictures to show contrast to the other more UFO looking pictures?  Or perhaps it's a sort of ""limited hangout"".  See, all these UFO reports are balloons after all...?  The ""Do Not Release"" notation is also very interesting and raises some flags for me."
UFOs,3ch6zf,Gohanthebarbarian,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:56:10 2015 UTC,"I think you're onto something with that.  The photo of the ""cigar"" UFO in the thumbnail image has visible ribbing, end-to-end, just as a dirigible-type airship would have.  Perhaps the general shape is the same 50 years before, but the construction of the frame under the outer skin changed."

UFOs,3ch6zf,DineLointHarpie,2,Wed Jul 8 00:26:03 2015 UTC,"yeah. they certainly look interesting. it look like the ufos seen in Belgia in the late 80's.

Ending in the object shooting out of the water and flying away. apparently it was in the newspapers, but I cant find the site where I read it."

I thought I would paste it here since there seems to be quite an interest:  UPDATE -- WORD FROM THE ADMIRAL  On July 8, 2015, investigator and former Navy pilot, Steve Murillo was asked make a phone call (by request of Alex Mistretta) to Admiral Sackett. In respect to the Admiral, the means to track him down are not going to be published so he is not inundated with calls but he was located. (We please ask, there are researchers currently corresponding with him, and we would prefer that no one track him down to ask for additional answers as this unfolds.)  The following is the update from Mr. Mistretta:  I asked Steve Murillo, head of UPARS, to speak with Admiral Dean R Sackett this morning. Steve is a former Navy pilot. Admiral Sackett was gracious enough to take the call, but steered away from the UFO question. Admiral Dean R Sackett said ""I only saw Ice"". He did agree to check out the pictures though email however, so we will see. This obviously doesn't prove anything in either direction. These could certainly be a hoax, or these are the real deal and Admiral Sackett is sticking to his security oath. Which incidentally, if that's the case, he has every right to do. Or these pictures are the real deal, and have no relationship with the Trepang submarine USS 674. There were apparently another sub in the region around the same time. I'll put up that info as I progress in this investigation. Thank you John Greenewald, Steve Murillo, and also Richard Carlson for some valuable assistance, by the way."

UFOs,3ch6zf,Snabelapan,3,Wed Jul 8 04:11:03 2015 UTC,"Having looked at these and looked at Trident missile launches, I think what we are seeing here is trials/tests of on board ballistic missiles being tested. the pieces appear to be fins and a warhead falling. Not necessarily a Trident, but the boat was in that area in the time stated and part of it's reason for being there was weapons systems fitness test and stuff of that manner.  The triangle thing could be a warhead stage falling back, the smoking tube is a spent missile. the one with the water is the one being shot through the water or simply falling back in and the horizontal one seems to be a continuation of the spent rocket falling.  That would be my point of view. Source of the photos and/or confirmation from a submariner would be good. they aren't super high quality photos, maybe a ship hands personal camera took them?"
UFOs,3ch6zf,CaerBannog,2,Wed Jul 8 20:45:40 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. I wonder if they would have been using a high speed camera to capture these objects. There is little to no motion blur with the cigar shaped object that seems horizontal with the water.
UFOs,3ch6zf,HydroFracker,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:17:26 2015 UTC,"They probably have more pictures, but those are only a few. Missile tests would have been filmed too. I would venture a guess there is more available. Got to wait it out and see what else comes out I guess."
UFOs,3ch6zf,CaerBannog,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:32:44 2015 UTC,"It would probably be very difficult or impossible to capture falling missile debris on camera through the periscope.  During a weapons test they would probably use high-speed film cameras from a surface-ship based tracking theodolite.  I say they're either UFOs or a hoax.  Would hoaxer try to give the objects more symmetry and less ambiguity?  To me it looks like the centerfold ""color"" photo has been tampered with.  I doubt you'd ever see any vivid colors thru a periscope."
UFOs,3ch6zf,gnatty_dread,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:47:29 2015 UTC,they look like balloons. the cropping and depth of field suggest the illusion would be ruined if the whole photo was shown.
UFOs,3ch6zf,JackNorthropsGhost,-1,Wed Jul 8 04:45:06 2015 UTC,There is a lot of cropping but it seems to indicate very distant large objects in my estimation and that would also account for the poor resolution.

UFOs,3ch6zf,DineLointHarpie,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:33:28 2015 UTC,I believe the cigar shaped object is a balloon of some sort. Maybe for practice shooting? In these much clearer photos (https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/3cm9wl/arctic_ufo_photographs_in_better_size_and_quality/) I can see that after it is shot and starts burning it loses it's shape somewhat and then crashes into the water. The splash of water is from the heat.  The image that looks like a mirage might be the cigar shaped balloon photographed from some distance.  The small object might be debris from the balloon floating around in the air.

Highly unlikely.  I think one of the most important, often overlooked aspects to this story, is the rancher Mac Brazel who originally found the debris field - he was out looking for damage to his fences and noticed vultures circling and went to investigate how many head of cattle he lost to the storm, and found the wreckage instead.  Vultures aren't interested in balloon debris, nor dummies."

UFOs,3cgaob,aLiEn23ViSiToR,3,Wed Jul 8 05:27:16 2015 UTC,"I mean this honestly and respectfully -- but why would a video like this get ANY press or attention whatsoever? Common sense tells us a couple things:  1) It looks like a plastic bag, or foam, or soap suds, or whatever that may be light weight, caught flight, and floated. It has every quality of something simply floating in the wind.  If it quacks like a duck, walks like a duck, smells like a duck, then why assume it's a churro?    2) The ""UFO"" (for lack of a better sarcastic term) is losing altitude. It is approaching the ground, and by the height of the building it goes behind, we can assume it hits the ground about 5-10 seconds if that after the video stops.  You could throw a rock and hit where it would have landed. Does anyone not think the camera person would have gone over and saw what ""landed"" -- or at least attempt to get a closer shot of the object?  3) The object pretty much resembles absolutely none of the other common UFO type objects reported. So, are we safe to assume that this person captured a new UFO, something humans have yet to see, that just happens to coincidentally look like a floating plastic bag?  Sometimes, it's just frustrating that the media latches on to stories like this -- and that's what the general public sees (those that dont look into the topic seriously) as the only proof investigators have to offer up on UFOs.  Ok, rant over ;)"

In other words, one does not need to believe in UFOs to study them scientifically.  The concept of ""aliens"", on the other hand, does require belief.  To say that UFOs = aliens is taking the phenomenon one bridge too far.  While many UFO cases do involve occupant sightings, who is to say who, what or from whence they come?  Those answers are, arguably, not knowable at this point in time."

There are degrees of belief, and they can be measured on a scale from 0 to 1 in a logically consistent way. For example, my ""belief"" that aliens is exist, or have existed is pretty high - I would put it at 0.9. My belief that any UFO reports are attributable ""alien"" activity is lower, but this is partly because we have no goddam idea what an alien would do, how it would behave, how it would travel here, or what it would look like.

Until we have an indisputable source, no one can say one way or another. I can suspect intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe.

Some of the science we use to send astronauts into space is based on theories, but those theories have practical applications. You're reaching if you want to say that scientists who study and try to prove theories, or use theories for practical application, are only able to do so because of a belief? No, the data doesn't lie, and it's the data to sends people down various different rabbit holes of discovery. While we don't understand the inner workings of everything, we can use what we have to put people on the moon. I'm not sure what point your trying to make or even your perspective, but I'm intrigued and respectfully interested in what you think, if you care to share your views."
UFOs,3cl062,Turd_wagon,2,Wed Jul 8 23:57:55 2015 UTC,"I don't like the phrase ""just a theory."" No, not at all. Real theories are the product of generations of very strenuous work and lots of frustration, sleepless nights, and blind alleys. There is a huge amount of empirical data consistently supporting the theory that the universe was once very much denser than it is at present. What's more, the underlying theory of gravity is extraordinarily well verified. All the alternatives to this have been eliminated. What happened in the first tiny fraction of  second is still controversial, though."
UFOs,3cl062,ASK47,-3,Thu Jul 9 02:08:42 2015 UTC,"You just need to research the history if science yourself, in books like the structure if scientific revolutions.   I can't spoon feed you as this takes serious brain power to grasp.  For example Einstein stated ""imagination is more important than knowledge"". Every idea exists in your mind before it's made real. He came up with relativity, which virtually nobody understood for a very very long time. They didn't even believe it, there was zero evidence to what he was suggesting. But, during that period where he was regarding as a nutjob, a few people had BELIEF that he could be right, so how to we test it ? It was their belief to devise something.  So it was one persons belief only, where he decided to observe an eclipse in very specific way to see if what he suggested could be true. You know the rest. It takes serious brain chops that until that point it was just ideas and belief for a very, very, long time. There are many examples of this.  In the past you would be just burnt at the stake for suggesting wild things like, the earth went around the sun and our sun was just another star. A dude was burnt at the Stake for presenting just that. These days, all new ideas are still regarded crazy, until one person with belief decides to see for real.  It's always one person, who has the belief."
UFOs,3cl062,ASK47,2,Thu Jul 9 01:12:47 2015 UTC,"Not true. The scientific community grabbed hold of relativity fairly quickly. Lorentz had already published his famous transformations, but didn't have an explanation for them. It's not hard to understand if you have the training, and it unifies so much and gets rid of the bothersome ether."
UFOs,3cl062,ASK47,5,Thu Jul 9 02:11:08 2015 UTC,"I feel certain that life on other planets is commonplace and that proof of this will be found in the next few decades by studying xenoplanets and even bodies in our own solar system. Considering the sheer mind-boggling numbers of planets out there, some of these life forms - and probably quite a lot - will be intelligent and some much more advanced than us technologically.  The idea that Earth is a unique fluke and that the rest of an incomprehensibly vast universe is a sterile wasteland does seem quite laughable and very arrogant to me. I strongly feel that life will turn out to be as common as weeds where there are favourable conditions, and also where it clings on under incredibly hostile environments. We have seen this on our own planet - life is everywhere in a remarkable profusion of forms.  In only a few decades we have discovered so much about our own planet and the universe through technology and science. 100 years ago we could barely fly on a glorified kite and now we have sent out primitive probes beyond our own system and have everyday technology that is cheap and would resemble magic only a few decades ago. Imagine what we will be doing in a few centuries or a race as curious and hungry for knowledge as we are.  The concept of an intelligent race being capable of visiting earth and taking an interest in humanity doesn't seem so silly to me as its exactly what we would do. Just because it is something beyond our knowledge doesn't prove its impossible or an absurd notion.  I do not know if UFOs are real but suspect that there's some element of truth to the phenomenon in some of the cases. Some of the evidence is difficult to explain and pretty convincing, but its hard to discern the truth as there is so much scepticism and deception at work. With today's computer technology, almost anything can be explained as CGI so getting good proof is very hard.  Even with independently corroborated evidence I think many would simply be unable or incapable of handling the concept of Earth not being the full extent of the relevant universe. Fear of the unknown is very powerful.  The suggestion that there is a cover-up by governments is also reasonable as the truth would be very upsetting to many and some would feel the need to control this information. Even with strong evidence and official confirmation, I think many would be unable to handle the concept of humanity just being a small part of a complex and unknown galaxy of intelligent races and ubiquitous life. The religious ramifications would be huge and could potentially create unrest and instability.  TL/DR Alien life visiting Earth is very plausible, proving it is not. Convincing people is harder still."
UFOs,3cl062,ASK47,-1,Wed Jul 8 21:52:18 2015 UTC,I concur people seem not to grasp that even 100 years ago we were basically in the dark ages.

It is ok to be passionate about a subject but don't allow it to cloud your judgment. Sometimes misplaced faith can cause one to discard reason in exchange for validation. I appreciate your interest in the subject, and your zeal is certainly obvious but lets not forget that everyone is entitled to their opinion and that perspective varies from person to person. We are all interested in UFO related sightings and phenomena but this subreddit does pride itself in sorting through the material and discussing its authenticity. I am sorry if your previous posts were not met with patience and open mindedness but try not to be so vindictive and pedantic. There are many users who misinterpret the purpose of this sub, all theories are welcome and ET is far and away the most popular. However the discussion here is geared more toward the identification of the flying objects based on the presented material and less around speculation of  paranormal activity. Trust me when I say that doesn't mean many users here don't want ET theory to become an explainable defined fact that we can look at touch and research. I think a lot of users here would love that. Until then try to understand that this sub gets bombarded by posts with people asking their opinions on ET and paranormal theories, sometimes the veteran and frequent users here get a little irritated with it and for that I apologize. Have you checked out /r/Aliens? The discussion there is geared more towards what I feel you might be looking for. Thanks for posting and keep up the search for the truth!"

When the time comes I may reach out for help. Is it ok if I contact you!? What is the best phone number to reach you at? Should I start doing deep meditations while under the influence of DMT so I can commune with your spirit and their spirits to help protect the people of Earth from the Archon influence!? What level of education under which fields of study do I need to be just as smart as you? Should I consider taking on an alias or fake my death to protect my family from rogue government agencies as we start investigating the truth together? I can't possibly wait to be just like you! You're so brilliant, almost overwhelmingly so. I just can't even be in your presence for too much time because God is reaching out to me now to tell me all about creationism and how I must follow you and learn all I can from the disciple known only as /u/flexiverse.

I believe aliens exist too, due to all the humanoids people report seeing, which seem to outnumber UFO sightings. But I don't believe these are ET from other planets, because there is no direct proof of that. Rather, they seem to be alien to both our status quo as the de facto intelligent species on the planet, as well as alien to the collective objective reality we reliably share during waking life (the ""high strangeness"" that you frequently hear about in conjunction with them)."
UFOs,3cl062,OldNedder,2,Wed Jul 8 23:21:02 2015 UTC,Well from my research it's more complex. There are cryptoterrestrials as well. Mac tonnies was killed because of things he uncovered and was trying to get out there.

I may have missed or not considered something, and I'm always interested in new angles from new people. (And you're the one who dangled complex research results in front of me like a carrot!)  This isn't about belief for me. It's about entertaining various hypotheses and assessing them in the light of science and logic. I entertain the possibility that there may be aliens, and that they may even be extraterrestrial. But it's much harder to entertain than cryptoterrestrials, based on what I know/believe/have faith in. Both could be true, but one is certainly more plausible than the other."

If I had to guess whether ""flying saucers"" exist, and my life depended on getting the correct answer, I'd have to say YES.

They're not real when someone posts a picture of a reflection from inside a window and say they saw it in the sky. Aliens don't exist as mummies in a museum that are labeled as mummified infants, but are posted here as legit proof of ET life. Many of us here have seen UFOs in the sky, some of us take pictures that turn out shitty. If I had taken video of the UFOs I saw with cameras available at the time they probably wouldn't have even shown on film. Most of us skeptical trolls are pooping on your party of fake ass videos that are constantly posted here."

It's so blindingly obvious infact there is clearly a deeper picture going on.  This is clearly carefully planned disinformation in view of the roswell anniversary to create as much negative laughable spin, so people don't ask the right questions.

Whether they are flying the UFOs or not is another matter. I simply believe life exists out there.  UFOs, I'd say it is closer to knowing they are real. Having the confidence to say you know something is true can be hard when you can't ever really be absolutely certain of anything but UFOs to me are as real as anything else in day to day life. After my experiences, the experiences of people I know, and the things I've read the existence of UFOs is not even in question."

Just because you can't tell what the object is, doesn't automatically mean it's filled with little green men.   For example: your standing in a field, and all the sudden a white ball flys just over the trees at the edge of the field. Until you know for sure what that white ball is it's a UFO. Upon further inspection, you're standing in a golf course and it was a golf ball.   UFO just means it was flying and we didn't know what it was. Claiming otherwise is an ignorant behavior."

UFOs,3cgmo0,dammitstacy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:33:54 2015 UTC,"It's because they objects captured by the shuttle camera (probably small ice particles) were out of focus, and characteristics of the optical system used. None of those apply in this case. It was a Canon DSLR with a high quality wide angle lens. In order to be that out of focus, the object would have to be right in front of the camera. The witnesses saw the object and it seemed quite distant to them (though I think it may have been a bit closer)."
UFOs,3cdppd,-ElectricKoolAid,18,Tue Jul 7 02:49:17 2015 UTC,"First I thought that this could actually be something. Maybe something similar to the Hessdalen lights in Norway.   But at 7.50 in the video it's pretty obvious what it is. It's just airplanes coming in for landing or taking off much further away than where they  think the lights are located.   The lights at 7.50 are going to the left and then turning towards the camera (8.17) and this is where it's the most obvious, the light pattern is green on the airplane's right wing, the white light in the middle is the head light and then we have red on its left wing. Pics here.,  It then banks left again only to be seen from the side (around 8.50).   A bit later (9.37) the airplane turns a bit more to its left and is moving away from the camera so we see the back of the airplane, notice that the green light can be seen on the right side now.  The green and red on the airplane's wings are a standard on airplanes, there might be  some exceptions for some military planes with different configurations, please correct me if I'm wrong on that part.   When she zooms out towards the end of the video you can also see some kind of tower in the background and I would believe that the airplanes are located as far back as that tower. That's why she can't hear the airplanes.   Here is a map I've made to show the approximate location of the airport and where I believe the airplanes are located and headed.  Also notice how zoomed in she is with the camera, that and the low light makes everything come out with a light trail in her pics at the end of the video.   Regarding the other lights in the video, the same applies, it's just airplanes coming in for landing or taking off.   The nightvision makes it look like there's only one point of light when in reality the airplanes are so bright (for the nightvision) it shows the lights as one source.   It also looks like the light ""bleeds"" on the trees during the nightvision, which also makes it look like the objects are in front of them and closer to the camera, that's just lensflares and as soon as the light goes behind the trees it disappears."

Damn impressive if you ask me and this is some of the best out there in terms of footage. You do get the eerie sense here that the orbs are up to something, are aware of onlookers and that they can disguise themselves as twinkling stars and aircraft.  Solid video. Once you witness shit like this live before your eyes, you wise up and your perspective changes."
UFOs,3cdppd,bickering_fool,2,Tue Jul 7 03:47:59 2015 UTC,Really interesting. Wonder if these lights over this area are still continuing.
UFOs,3cdppd,mzziz,2,Tue Jul 7 05:57:54 2015 UTC,"I think seeingUFOsPA is doing great work recording this phenomena. It seems to be the same thing people are seeing all around the world. Solomon Islanders have been watching these for generations now. In Hawaii, they are called Akualele 'flying gods', and are often seen as green or orange orbs traveling along the horizon Also, Alabama Bigfoot Society has a very similar video of these orbs in the woods, going up to a big black/purple craft. These orbs are also associated with sasquatch somehow, according to many credible witnesses.The orbs can morph into whatever they want to look like apparently. I am convinced that entities from other worlds, be they extraterrestrial or interdimensional, are here, have been here, as long or longer than we have."

UFOs,3chkmc,sherrymacca,7,Tue Jul 7 23:33:06 2015 UTC,Uhhh...moons?
UFOs,3chkmc,waxandwane,3,Wed Jul 8 05:54:53 2015 UTC,I thought it might be moons at first but I didn't think a regular hand held camera would be able to take pictures of it's moons.
UFOs,3chkmc,Crimfants,5,Wed Jul 8 17:46:59 2015 UTC,"The moons are fairly bright, and are easy to see with binoculars, so yeah, that's what it could be. They don't look like lens flares to me - they are too close to the light source. You can characterize your camera's lens flares pretty easily using the moon or a street lamp."
UFOs,3chkmc,Crimfants,2,Wed Jul 8 20:30:18 2015 UTC,"If they are the moons, then you have Io and Europa there. Ganymede and Callisto should be on the same side as Io (which I think is theo ne on the left), according to Sky Safari."
UFOs,3chkmc,foobastion,3,Wed Jul 8 20:57:45 2015 UTC,"I am an amateur astronomer. Those are the moons. The image is out of focus which gives the effect that those objects are larger than they really are. Jupiter has 4 moons that are visible with low magnification equipment. Ganymede, Io, Europa, Callisto. They look like bright star-like points of light in a telescope. Because Jupiter is so large, the moons frequently dip behind it as they revolve. So not all 4 are visible at all times here on Earth. However, when the moons pass in front of Jupiter - a transit - they appear as small black spots against the bright background of Jupiter. Both Jupiter and Saturn are really awesome sights. Most folks don't know what they are missing."

UFOs,3chkmc,guido_pilot,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:27:49 2015 UTC,The reason I don't think it's lens flares is because they look like solid objects not just white reflected light.
UFOs,3ccm8k,AlwaysBeNice,7,Mon Jul 6 21:34:13 2015 UTC,"These apparently high-altitude ""triangles"" have become a pretty common theme with these night vision videos.

It sure would be a good idea to send these kinds of videos to an astronomer who is most familiar with satellites (which is my guess, even considering the speed)"
UFOs,3ccm8k,timmy242,5,Tue Jul 7 00:48:27 2015 UTC,"Setup properly by credible people, and with enough videos from from different sources, these could be used to document some very legitimate evidence for ufos. More legitimate than most. I know people are doing this but likely not up to scientific standards, or with a coordinated effort.  It would be cool to see what a massive scale study would turn up.  Probably just ""there are ufos"" and little else, but I think it would lend more credence to the topic."

UFOs,3ccm8k,doctorbooshka,5,Tue Jul 7 18:56:58 2015 UTC,It really looks like a satellite. I would be interested to know where he was shooting and what time. Then would could conclusively rule out satellites before we jump to UFO.
UFOs,3ccm8k,foobastion,4,Mon Jul 6 22:27:54 2015 UTC,"Some of his other videos are interesting. Some of the objects appear to change course. He even shoots at a few of them with a laser, and they appear to react. https://youtu.be/V7KpAYIIYHc?t=140  In this clip the object on the far right appears to make an 'S' shaped route while changing speed. 30 seconds later on he starts shooting at them with a laser. Most of these look like satellites to me. Especially those that are moving in straight lines. Maybe the ones that move around are bugs? That is the only other explanation I can think of right now. I'd like to see what a bug looks like through that camera.  Edit: The first one he shoots at with the laser looks like a meteorite to me. The second one... is pretty interesting.

UFOs,3ccm8k,bobafe6604,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:34:34 2015 UTC,I am not ruling out they can't be satellites now but it still doesn't seem likely to me(?).  The dots seem to have quite some space in between them and I have never seen a satellite that gives of that look nor can I find anything that appears to look like it in google images of satellites.
UFOs,3ccm8k,bobafe6604,2,Tue Jul 7 08:40:50 2015 UTC,"Well let us be fair with each other. A few didn't look quite like Sats but a whole bunch had the perfect silhouette of a solar powered satellite. They look like spaceships, naturally by design. The others could of been tumbling in a manor that would be hard to recognize and that's why I don't recognize them but... if you look up at a sharks silhouette while hes swims above you, it doesnt look like a shark. it looks like a new animal. but yet we all know what a shark looks like from above or directly next to.   i guess its possible this man discovered a UFO super highway and everything is undetectable by radar and moves to quick to be seen by the naked eye, but i feel it's much more fair to call them what they most likely are, the things that we know are there and there certainly are enough satellites that you could do this, sit and film them all day. whizzing across the sky in straight lines."

UFOs,3ccm8k,ZOZUM,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:59:01 2015 UTC,"Constant speed. Straight lines. Depending upon setup, it could be a lot of things. knowing the camera location, position & direction would help.   Those things look to me like they cross the lens at a similar angle - could indicate reflections in passing vehicles, etc. (spitball alert).  Using the lens specifications and calculating the time to cross the lens, you can estimate possible height/velocities of the object if you assume orbital distances & velocities. Orbital altitude above said mass dictates velocity. (I couldn't - I don't know the relevant calculations - just saying)   Source: KSP"

UFOs,3ccm8k,micktravis,0,Tue Jul 7 08:33:45 2015 UTC,"Could you name some things aside from the things you already mentioned?   Sure. Something like the following spring to mind:    Insects  Other light airborne objects close to the lens. Fluids/condensation    Can you elaborate? Reflections in passing vehicles, spitball alert? How so? And KSP?     Think of a static camera pointing in a direction. If there is a road nearby, lights from passing cars as they drive down the road could create similar reflections.    KSP   Taught me a lot about orbits, velocities, etc. You can have fairly fast moving objects in a constant orbit, and fairly slow, all the way down to apparently stationary objects in orbit (geostationary ). If you know the lens setup, you could calculate a range of possible orbits depending upon how much distance the objects travel.  Something along the lines of this. You'd have to know how much area of the sky your setup covers though.  I'm not saying that they're not interesting, I'm just pointing out that it's not necessarily an orbital, or even high-altitude object. More info would be nice :)"

UFOs,3cb95v,doucheposse,3,Mon Jul 6 17:01:00 2015 UTC,Can you describe your experience and the area?
UFOs,3cb95v,DineLointHarpie,7,Mon Jul 6 18:06:48 2015 UTC,"Sure, I was driving to work, and was listening to the radio -- I heard a guy call in and say there were some weird lights over the Catalinas (Santa Catalina Mountains, southern AZ).  Of course, there was the usual response from the DJ, something to the effect of:  ""you've been hittin' the bong pretty early today.."".    Anyways, as I was traveling south on what is known as Kino Parkway, I looked over my left shoulder and saw there too some brilliant lights over the Catalinas.  I remember a bright pink and blue light cascade, for lack of a better term, coming from somewhere over the mountains, near as I could figure, north of the Sabino Canyon area.  I stopped my car, got out, and spyed what I could only describe as a super reflective pyramid rising slowly through the air.  Like the top of an obelisk, like the Washington monument, but crazy reflective.  I could not believe my eyes, and tried to stop other people driving along, but they were mostly on their way to work too, so nobody stopped.  It was then that I wanted to get somebody else as a witness to see if this thing was really there.  I drove to my work and asked the receptionist if she wanted to see a UFO.  ""No, I'm to busy...""    I literally had to drag my supervisor off of his workstation outside to witness it.  Yes, there were other witnesses (~6), but no one would go on record as to what they saw (I followed up for the next few days -- calling military bases, colleges, universities, high schools, TV stations, witness interviews, etc).  It continued to rise, super slowly for while, maybe another five-ten minutes, until it was almost out of sight.  Then it kind of ""blinked"" out of my eyesight.  It could have just reached to high for me to see, I don't know.  After it disappeared a number of aircraft flew quite quickly to where it had been rising from.  I saw at least two Blackhawk helicopters fly right towards where it was, if that means anything.  So I'm not sure what I believe, but I know what I saw!!!"

UFOs,3c69wl,CaerBannog,3,Mon Jul 6 20:34:56 2015 UTC,"I agree wholeheartedly and have been saying this for years, but take a look at the kind of submissions we have in this sub. This is a microcosm of what UFO enthusiasts actually believe. People are still talking about fucking Reptilians and the TR-3B.   We just went thru one of the worst debacles UFO research has had in years, the ""Roswell Slides"" fuckup. Absolute shit show from beginning to end.  You'd think that anyone familiar with the subject and keeping up with events would say ""holy shit, we really have to get a little bit more serious with our critical thinking skills in this field.""  Nope. Right away we're back to crop circles and the fucking Turkey cruise ship videos. It's pathetic.  Anyone doing serious UFO research at this point in time has gone underground. They're not doing it in public. Public UFO researchers might from time to time present some good evidence, but from my perspective, most of them veer quickly into the crackpot conspiracy area and destroy what little credibility they might have had. I have seen this time and time again.  We aren't going to be able to police UFOlogy adequately, because there are so many dumbfucks who believe any old horseshit without using critical thinking skills and research.   What you've said is the entire basis of my approach to UFO research, and has been for a long time (since the Alien Autopsy film debacle). I'm often treated like a pariah for attempting to be just basically level-headed in dealing with evidence.   I'm regularly accused of being a ""shill"" (whatever the fuck that is) a debunker and worse, even though I have repeatedly stated that I think there is a core of anomalous phenomena at the heart of UFO reports, and support some as legitimate evidence of something unknown. It is very dispiriting.   You may find that, like me, you just get more and more cynical and pissed off with the naivety of UFO True Believers™ to the point where you've actually learned the keyboard code to put a fucking ™ symbol next to the phrase whenever you use it, and go on lengthy rants peppered with obscenities on obscure UFO discussion forums on the internet, while keeping your real research work absolutely private and unavailable to anyone.   I don't talk to people in RL about UFOs. Why? Because the experience you describe is typical of these kinds of exchanges. The other type is a dull response like ""huh?"" and complete vacuity.  Sorry, what you've said has really hit a nerve. There is an important phenomenon worthy of study here, that might lead to significant breakthroughs for humanity, but it is being ignored because of the kind of idiots you describe tarnishing the field."

UFOs,3c69wl,80sKid,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:32:33 2015 UTC,It's well appreciated that is for sure. Not many people talk about how people precieve UFOs which makes people not even want to bring it up. How can we even have a legitimate conversation if nobody is willing to talk about it seriously right?  I think this all falls on those people that have made hoax videos. They ruined it for everyone.
UFOs,3c69wl,oscaralexander,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:42:14 2015 UTC,"Man, precisely my point there. These people are doing damage to a perfectly good field of research (even if we research to the best of our abilities and undeniably discover that there is no such thing as UFOs).   Think about all the average people in the world uninterested in UFOs - they go onto the internet one day and see a hoaxed video that's obvious a fake, even to them. What are they going to think?  Well, they're certainly not going to look deeper into the subject, that's for sure. They didn't care much to begin with; it was a surprise they even checked the video out. But it was a hoax, so farewell to any other future UFO links being clicked by that one person.  Not everyone has the same enthusiasm as we do regarding this subject - to dig through the mud and shit to get to the good stuff - it requires a passion or a belief that there is SOMETHING under that mud, even if it actually turns out to be nothing at all (but even then,  after digging up nothing, you at least know you no longer have to dig through the mud, right?)  These are the people we need to inflict change to. We need to change the views of the average individual who does not care about the UFO phenem and show them why this should be researched just like any other thing we are interested in.  I kind of look at it (part of it, at least) like Marijuana prohibition. Many people who don't give a shit about it fall victim to the stereotypes (you become dumb, kills brain cells, etc) simply because they don't care to learn more. However, when they walk into a store and see a man in a business suit wielding a briefcase buying an expensive item while talking respectfully to the cashier while OBVIOUSLY high, well - it is things like that that change the perception of the disinterested (oh, not EVERYONE who smokes weed is dumb? Oh, not EVERYONE who researches UFOs is a Lunatic?) We need to get out there by forming small groups of average people to start swaying the public opinion little by little"
UFOs,3c69wl,mhmnope,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:56:32 2015 UTC,Good points.  The way I am going to go about it is to just sit back and wait for that undeniable proof that will be hard to dispute. It will be one of those moments when you wake up to 'hear the news' and be surprised that someone actually caught something and has hard evidence.   I know what my beliefs are about UFO and aliens so I don't need to be convinced by someone posting a video. I'm more interested in the undeniable footage. I feel I wont have to seek that out because that kind of smoking gun will be out in the open for everyone to see.

This is exactly it. It should not be approached with ridicule despite lack of evidence - the ridicule itself is in the way of gathering any evidence to begin with. It is no wonder why we have no solid evidence.  I posted this wall of text here because I'm thinking that through local-level research and the discovery of UFO stories that have gone unnoticed due to the people that witnessed them we will manage to find our ""solid info"", even if that solid info is very very small info.

UFOs,3c69wl,whatthefuckdoiknow,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:18:04 2015 UTC,"Great point.   While I'm well aware of MUFON and what they are doing, the significance of my idea lays within being single, unimportant entities ourselves. This is where our credibility is generated, because being as we have limited resources, no funding, no budget, and no agenda, our words may speak about a larger truth.  The fact remains though that you're right; MUFON is doing it better, larger, and with legitimacy (in my eyes.) Again though, I think my idea here is that it would be striking to have scattered bands of ""nobodys"" coming forth with very compelling UFO evidence. The fact they have no affiliation with any UFO research group would perhaps help us out in terms of credibility.  I would like to add though that as soon as I begin my new job, I plan on inquiring about MUFON and possibly joining in some capacity.   Thanks for taking the time to read and post here."
UFOs,3c69wl,dopp3lganger,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:43:17 2015 UTC,"Yea, no problem. I get what you're trying to do, but I think (just my opinion) that to gather these unaffiliated accounts, at some point you would need to create an entity, akin to MUFON simply to gather all of these reports.   The ones reporting would not be part of this group, but I think one person doing it alone will be overwhelming. I also think you need some central sort of group to coordinate and store then spread all of these accounts. Even if you had groups across the world collecting stories from their neighborhood, It doesn't do anyone any good if people sit on a stack of 10 story's and no one else hears about them.  Just food for thought and to consider when starting a venture of this magnitude. Complete decentralization in this instance might not be as good as it sounds at face value.

I was excited because it was my first real chance to study them in the sky, especially since there were so many, and I can definitely see where people get confused. I had an experience in 2012 where I saw dozens of dancing lights up high enough that they looked like stars, they were going in straight lines up and down as well as sideways and going around each other. That being said the lanterns can be tricky because of the movement, sometimes they appear to float in place or move quickly or slowly based on the wind. Also if they're moving strait toward you they look like they're getting bigger and brighter. I'm just happy I've seen what I have so I can make the comparisons. Tricky business for sure!"

Flying parallel to the coast they eventually went past me about 100 meters from me and then it was clearly visible that it was a lantern. From a distance they looked strangely large compared to their real size.

The older adults in the group couldn't see them and my phone camera, which is all I had on me, certainly wouldn't have picked it up. And honestly I was so caught up in the moment I didn't even think of recording anything haha.  EDIT: As for Melinda, she didn't record anything and I didn't think to ask her if she ever had in the past. I should have. She said she has had 11 (out of about 500) tours where they could see UFOs low enough to see the structure. I wonder if she or anyone in the group recorded those."
UFOs,3c4ebe,cazzzidy,4,Sat Jul 4 18:17:47 2015 UTC,"I am so happy to see this post. I also attended one of her tours in Sedona, Arizona and it was a very moving experience.  I went out with a group of 6 or 8. It was relatively clear. Using the night vision goggles I was able to see high altitude UFOs that were barely visible to the naked eye. The most memorable involved two points of light, about the brightness of a faint star, coming towards each other, stopping, then zipping off in different directions. I was 100% certain that what I witnessed was not a traditional aircraft or satellite.   The most probable explanation, if I'm being cynical, is some sort of high altitude drone program. Apparently they consistently appear in one area of the sky, which suggests to me that we are watching a phenomena that has a geographical origin on earth. We were also encouraged to point lasers at the object to try to induce communication. If what we were witnessing and lasering were indeed secret aircraft, I'm confident the operators know of her business and probably let her keep at it. That would be the Mirage Man thing to do.    I'd suggest that the skeptics check themselves. This woman consistently delivers on her promise of witnessing high altitude anomalous objects. Not a week goes by that I don't think about buying a 3rd gen night vision scope and picking up where I left off in the desert. The tour is awesome and everyone should do it."

UFOs,3c4ebe,Nixplosion,3,Sat Jul 4 19:19:02 2015 UTC,Well if you're ever in Sedona and the skies are clear I really recommend it! The experience actually made me want to buy a pair of night vision goggles myself so I can look for UFOs on my own. It was even cool just to see so many more stars in the sky than you can without the night vision. Only thing is I guess they're pretty expensive for some good ones. Melinda said the pairs we were using were $4000 a piece...
UFOs,3c4ebe,AlwaysBeNice,2,Sat Jul 4 20:55:19 2015 UTC,Yikes! How much did she charge for this excursion?
UFOs,3c4ebe,Iamnesty,5,Sat Jul 4 21:07:01 2015 UTC,"$75 per person. I was really skeptical at first because of the price and because she garuntees sightings or your money back. Once she said how expensive the goggles were I understood why it was $75/person haha. Also she can only take 10 people at a time and she doesn't seem to have any problems getting every tour mostly full, my point being why wouldn't you charge as much as people are willing to pay, and when you have so little room you don't want 50 people trying to get in every night."

Here's Leslie describing her abduction by ETs and being transferred over to our military  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcGDKLwRiXw  I'm in the wrong line of work. All of that said, I REALLY want a decent night vision goggle. As AlwaysBeNice pointed out, a lot is seen with these  https://www.youtube.com/user/Lou20764/videos  which, AFAIK, hasn't been explained. Here's a DIY night vision tube  http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Cascade-Night-Vision-Scope/step2/Gather-ALL-the-Parts/  and only $130. Here's Leslie explaining the MILAB she referenced above  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOON1vMBTlE  in case you're still reading. In this instance she was abducted by military and handed over to a reptilian who raped and murdered her (by mental projection) in order to impress upon her the importance of desisting her exposure of their operations. As terrifying as she says it all was, she's still telling everyone. Guess business is good.  As for a question put by one of the tour members,   ""Could it also be a super-secret government spacecraft or an extremely high-altitude drone?” I asked. Melinda dismissed this immediately: “Why would the government do something in secret yet allow us to see it?” She's also a psychic medium so I suppose I'd expect a better answer than this.  Yeah, I'm definitely in the wrong line of work. After all, she still enjoys all this ""success"" even though the mainstreamers won't really have anything to do with her. Go figure.

And I'll say this just in case you may have taken any of it personally (you sound a little angry or defensive)...to the very slight extent that I post anything, I try to be informative, for the sake of everyone who might come across the thread. I'm glad you posted--I'd never heard of her, and she's not exactly well-known in the field. Just trying to help, even tho it might get me downvoted. For instance, I posted a link where you can build your own night vision apparatus for only $130.  Maybe some of my references were vague to you? I'd be glad to clear up any confusion."

UFOs,3c4ebe,vikingv,2,Sun Jul 5 01:29:42 2015 UTC,"If put into a corner I'd say that she's a real opportunist before I'd stoop to calling her crazy. Crazy smart maybe? Trouble with $$ is that it can muddy the waters/make it hard to discern what someone's motives are, and yes--we're allowed to ask about that. That's one reason why Greer is so despised, or why a lotta people resent the players in the recent Roswell Slides fiasco, etc. Ufology as a field is littered with such. Neither do I generally approve of the charlatans of Sedona who, for all their talk and guise and promise of spirituality, smell money first. Guess I'm just not with the times?  But no. I try to avoid making conclusive judgments, preferring rather to be as informed and nuanced as possible in my own research, and for that mere profit and entertainment don't interest me.  I'm fine with irony, too, as in the case of your having done this with her so that we here can benefit by it in whatever way we will. It's up to each of us to do our own work and you've helped contribute to that, even though it's something I disapprove of."
UFOs,3c4ebe,laowhoo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:14:06 2015 UTC,"Ok that makes more sense. I will agree that when someone is charging money for such a service, especially $75 a person, it definitely makes their motives and intent questionable. My only thinking is that it's no different than any other business or service. She provides a service, with a money back guarantee, and has determined what a good price point is for the demand. Her intent is  pretty clear to me: to make money. Does that mean she is scamming people by lying to them? Not necessarily. She has simply found a unique way to make money off of something she is interested and knowledgable in, and she has put in the initial investment to do so. (3 pairs of night vision goggles at $3000-4000 a pair). Not trying to argue, your thinking is totally rationale and understandable, I'm just explaining mine."
UFOs,3c4ebe,CaerBannog,6,Sun Jul 5 04:48:51 2015 UTC,"Yes Gawillamon, as I said, I'm in the wrong business. She's crazy smart that way, and I am a bit sensitive to separating people from their money.   And I AM glad you posted b/c she's new to me, and my first reaction is to question. It's what we do here. We also have to be careful how we do it b/c we're confined to text only, and done poorly people wouldn't feel free to post about anything. When I saw that she also runs a full-service paranormal station, and has been doing such for over 25 years, well...my ears bled a little. As a side note, a member of my family was involved in James Arthur Ray's 2009 sweat lodge debacle and has since left that group after avoiding prosecution.  I applaud your posting, and even more your willingness to continue the conversation. I'm grateful too, as I've wondered about the night vision sightings and will now make a tube to go with our outreach telescope for the kids.  Cheers   p.s. To those who'd object to my original post with links, just consider the incredulity with which she was met by the investigators who interviewed her.

It wrinkled a bit like an on coming airliner but was moving terribly slow. Anyway as it got above me it flickered until the light became less and less and disappeared right above me. I'm thinking a Chinese lanterns flame finally being extinguished, but Interesting nonetheless. I'm in new York by the way."

UFOs,3c62fv,prettymuchscrewedup,2,Sun Jul 5 04:45:31 2015 UTC,"I understand. Regarding this part of your second paragraph: ""Once I did, I found it odd that I kept seeing it come from the same position in the sky and go to basically the same position on the other side of the horizion."" - Even though you changed locations, was the object still maintaining that SW to NE trajectory, or was it in a completely different part of the sky by the time you moved to the new location?   I'm curious because I've seen lights over this onion field (clear line of sight) just flying back and forth from end to end, but each time it reached the end of one horizon (or my line of sight at least) it would go slightly further out the next time it would arrive at that spot. Imagine sort of drawing a circle, then drawing a slightly larger circle around that one, a slightly larger one around the first two, etc. The circles represent the slight distance further he went on each loop.  Anyway, that's besides the point. Thanks for sharing your experience."
UFOs,3c62fv,prettymuchscrewedup,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:51:26 2015 UTC,"I had assumed that it was one object making a loop, with part of the loop out of my sight.  When I started paying attention, there was no way that it was making a loop.  The change of locations was about a 20 ft move, from one part of my yard to another.  It was several objects, each starting at point a, and traveling to point b.  Pretty sure that point b was the same each time.  Maybe should still be outside waiting to see if they return."
UFOs,3c62fv,prettymuchscrewedup,2,Sun Jul 5 04:58:46 2015 UTC,"Okay, gotcha. Was there any significant event occurring at ground-level in the general area that might be perceived to be ""beneath"" the light? A concert, fireworks display, parade, etc? I wonder with the 4th of July weekend and all might bring out Quadracoptors (NOT DRONES) in order to take footage of the fireworks display spanning a large distance.  Bit of a stretch, but I think that there could be a connection between large events and an influx in numbers of Quadracopters being used maybe to take video coverage.  Despite all that speculation though, still an interesting sighting. I have one more question, if you don't mind.  Were you close enough to get a look at the center of the light at any point? If so, how would you describe it?  Ah, here's another one, haha. Regarding the color as well as the color changes - how would you describe the quality of the color it produced? Was it just an easy red/blue/green or whatever, or did it have other characteristics to it that made it different than say a street light of the same color? I ask this because I've read many reports (again, who knows precisely what is true and what is not, right) of people seeing orbs or even straight up aircraft, but the quality of the lights had a luminosity or ""richness"" to it that was different."
UFOs,3c62fv,The_Juggler17,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:14:22 2015 UTC,"There were big fireworks displays 4 miles away in the direction of point a, and possible big display 6 miles away towards point b.   The center of the light was very bright, but did not cast shadows or tint the area with the color.  If I had to describe it further, it was almost like something propelled by a road flare.  Like a burning chemical.  I wear contact lenses, and it made my eyes get blurry when I looked at it too long.  It was a long day and I should probably change them.  My 9 year old son also looked at it and I asked him what he saw.  He got unnerved and wanted to go inside, but basically saw what I saw with no prompting."
UFOs,3c62fv,windsynth,2,Sun Jul 5 05:22:27 2015 UTC,"Cool.   I ask that question because I saw two orbs that appeared to be quite low but were completely silent fly directly above my friends and I years ago. A second follows 5 minutes later and it appeared to fly almost in the EXACT position as the last one. I mean, it was that precise.  Anyway, I remember the center of this light being almost a brilliant, ""white hot"" color that transitioned from a deep orange on the outer edges into a white-hot center. The entire thing was flickering, but from a distance it looked solid."
UFOs,3c62fv,whatthefuckdoiknow,2,Sun Jul 5 06:10:04 2015 UTC,"I saw a strange object last night too - came here to post about it. Never saw such a thing in my life, but it sounds very similar to your description.   It was an orange light with some red, like fire. Travelling at a constant speed and direction, in a similar fashion as an airplane. But much brighter and bigger than the light on an airplane, and flickering in an irregular way.   By all reasoning, it was probably some kind of airplane. But I've never saw an airplane with a light like that."

UFOs,3c62fv,disclosureftw,2,Sun Jul 5 19:34:40 2015 UTC,This haze from Alberta hanging over everything isn't helping. I stared at a motionless orange orb for 5 minutes before realizing it was Venus with a tint.   It sounds from your description that it could have been gliders with pyrotechnic effects. Seems a bit unlikely unless there are some air shows going on around here.  Did the sparks match the color of the object? Did it seem random like a sparkler or were they dispersed in an orderly way like flares?

Image  To quote from the related text in his message that described it:   The angle of this photo is close to exact, though in the video the actual center may have been slightly higher up from the horizon.  The numbers represent points that I made a mental note of where I observed the main .. whatever it was .. throughout the course of the video, until number 5.  I stopped recording after number 4 due to running out of storage on the phone.  :(   Number 5 is where I last observed the object(s), as it slowly made its way past the tree line.  At this point I was able to find a spare phone I had in my tech bag, and made a valiant effort to track it down again -- past that tree line is a very large open field.  Unfortunately once I got there, the object(s) were no longer anywhere to be seen.  Regarding the darkness of the clip -- its very rural where I am, no city light pollution.  Also, the nexus6 cam corder doesnt have much configuration ability by default, and unfortunately there wasn't much I could do since I was more focused on ensuring I was capturing the things as best I could, as clearly as I could.

UFOs,3btzut,Lukasasorensen,36,Thu Jul 2 03:28:33 2015 UTC,"Well, it would help if we actually had photos that were not fakes by which to judge.   The typical concept of a flying saucer as it is imagined in pop culture is based on images supplied by early UFO claimants, for example George Adamski, who made fake photos out of various kit bashed items such as gasoline lantern hoods.   In fact the whole idea of a ""flying saucer"" and the classic '50s style UFO exemplified by your first pic is based on a misunderstanding.  The first famous modern UFO sighting and the one which kicked off the whole popular fervour was Kenneth Arnold's sighting in '47. This was the origin of the term ""flying saucer"".   But Arnold didn't see flying saucers. He saw chevron or delta-shaped craft. He described their movement as being like a saucer skipped over water, and the description stuck, but the craft were actually shaped like futuristic fighter craft, and not like vehicles current at the time.   Sightings in New Mexico prior to the Roswell incident also described these chevron or delta shaped craft, not discs. The Roswell craft was allegedly not a saucer.   Earlier sightings like the WWII ""foo fighters"" that both allied and axis pilots saw were spheres of glowing light.   There were many fake photos produced by various people through the '50s and '60s. Most used constructed models from available items, like hubcaps and so on, but these fakers were designing their mockups based on the misnomer ""flying saucer"" or ""flying disc"" used by the press.   Then we have these ideas begin influencing fiction, and notably science fiction movies and stories.  The more interesting sightings that appear genuine describe craft that usually fall outside of these expectations. The Socorro sighting, for example.   Aviation genius Kelly Johnson witnessed what he described as a disc in 1953, but he was seeing it side-on, his test crew saw the same object from the air and described it, again, as a delta or chevron shaped craft. Given that he went on to help design cutting edge aircraft such as the Blackbird family, it could be argued this sighting influenced design, rather than was influenced by it.   It's clear that delta or chevron shaped aircraft are the modern approach to aviation design, so the 1947 sightings are far ahead of their time.   Obviously, witnesses did report sphere and disc shaped craft, but these were often seen at distance, and I'd argue that the early media fervour influenced interpretation.  So, really, the design ethic has been influenced by UFO reports, not the other way around. Other than a few flying wing aircraft designs which weren't in regular operation, aviation designs of those eras did not resemble the reports from early credible witnesses.   Ditto the black triangles. These appear earlier than such ideas appearing in popular culture and arguably influence them. The first report of a flying triangle UFO AFAIK is the 1952 Operation Mainbrace report.   (Edited because Bruce Macabee don't like me hotinkin')"
UFOs,3btzut,CaerBannog,5,Thu Jul 2 05:34:46 2015 UTC,Well said! Ever heard of this plane?  HO229  First came to my mind seeing Arnolds ship.
UFOs,3btzut,zottelig,9,Thu Jul 2 10:53:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it's unlikely the Ho 229 could account for Arnold's sighting. It would take a miracle of time travel for the US to get the prototype working, then build a squadron of them in the time frame. Plus, they didn't fly as fast as the vehicles Arnold saw, nor were all of Arnold's craft the same design type."
UFOs,3btzut,CaerBannog,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:06:34 2015 UTC,"You're probably right.  But it's worth considering that the Germans bled information.

A very mainstream book about Area 51 (can some one help me with her name? female journalist?) came out a few years ago that ended with a bombshell story of captured Nazi tech and Stalin genetically altering pilots to look like aliens, and that being the explanation for Roswell. The thing i noticed was Popular Mechanics put the book on their cover as bait to buy the issue and then spent the whole issue trashing the book. Even more layers of info/disinfo/misinfo was the result."
UFOs,3btzut,farmerdaniel,3,Thu Jul 2 17:21:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah I remember this book. The theory presented sounds like complete insanity, including lots of big-name-recognition actors fucking around with no apparent motive. It absolutely reeks of bullshit in every possible way.

UFOs,3btzut,horse_architect,0,Fri Jul 3 05:28:10 2015 UTC,"The strange thing is the way it is all in the last chapter after a completely normal book about aircraft and pilots.

Could easily have been a last minute panic by the publisher over a boring book to 'spice it up.' But on the other hand I'm getting used to the ridiculous being proven true. 'Soviet captured Nazi flying saucer' is no more or less whack an idea than any other in this field."
UFOs,3btzut,farmerdaniel,0,Fri Jul 3 05:35:55 2015 UTC,That book was nonsense and there's not a jot of evidence to back up those claims. The reason it was trashed is because it was ludicrous. Not even UFOlogists took it seriously.

UFOs,3btzut,Solaire_of_LA,-1,Thu Jul 2 18:56:14 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately that report is difficult because it is not first hand and comes from just one person, the scribe.

In other words, it is not necessarily an accurate report of what was actually seen, because that sort of reporting is a modern convention."

In the late 19th century you have all these reports of mysterious airships that resembled blimps- the technology that was reported seemed to reflect the times. As Caer points out Arnold did not see a flying saucer- but soon after you start getting tons of saucer sightings. Maybe that's the form it took for a lot of people because they'd read the newspaper stories about ""flying saucers"" and that's what they were expecting to see. Maybe these craft are something similar to the idea of tulpas, ie, they are some type of thoughtform that are at least partially dependent on the witnesses for their existence."

While I'm willing that some people see things which the rest of us don't, what possible meaning or relevance could this have had if it had been true? I wonder whether Nancy is still standing by him? (She's had her own difficulties since Colin Andrews and others questioned Levengood's methods/findings). Moreover, if Robbert is making his living as the Netherland's most famous psychic, what possible good could come of this?"
