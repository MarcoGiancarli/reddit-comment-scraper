If you don't do the legwork of thinking through a very accurate pro forma plan and base it off of very robust market analysis, you'll be one of the many, many businesses that go under in the first three years.

Unless you want to gamble your life away (and yes, this strategy is entirely a gamble), do the work. Surround yourself with smart people, a couple of whom have experience in the industry you're interested in, grow slowly and expand only when you can hire talented people under you, and generally hire for general aptitude rather than experience."

IWantToLearn,3e0zu0,NoFreakingIdea,36,Tue Jul 21 03:06:06 2015 UTC,"I used to want to be a spy while growing up. Still do. But that caused me to read a lot of books on body language and observational skills. The one real benefit of all this is noticing tiny changes. I'm always the first to notice a slight change in a haircut or color or new bag or something like that. Granted, I think a lot of the girls at the office think I'm stereotypically gay now, but seeing an older woman you work with in an elevator an noticing her new ""do"" and asking her about it seems to make the most of her day.   I once met a very pretty girl in Chicago and noticed her eyes had two little spots in them that were identical and complimented her one it a la ""I like how your eyes have matching freckles!"". She was overwhelmed and said that nobody had noticed them before.  An older lady at work had a strand of her hair dyed purpled and I pointed it out in front of a group and she grew red, noting that not even her husband had noticed.  Basically, notice small, inconsequential things. It helps if the people are also inconsequential (e.g. not datable, meaning you're not really as creepy as you sound and there's no ulterior motive).  It makes me feel good and I make it a point to give a stranger a complement every day. It can be something profound or common. People won't mind. And if they do, fuck 'em. You're just trying to be nice and they can brush it off as somebody being creepy.   In my experience though, just saying something nice about somebody, casually and as genuine as possible makes everybody happy. When I get to my place in line at Starbucks now my coffee is waiting for me. I don't even have to place an order at my favorite lunch spots because they know what I want. My favorite pubs ask which one of my usuals I want. And that's just because I've paid attention, was nice, courteous, and paid complements to people. Not because of these ""benefits"" but being that way makes you feel better about yourself and makes other people happy. It's a win-win.  I will warn though: there's a fine line between being over-complementary and creepy. If you're a good looking guy/girl it's becomes harder to do this I've found (via watching others). I'm a blonde dude and computer-nerd so I suppose it's easier for people to accept me as being genuine.   TL;DR: Just complement people on things. They'll either accept it, ignore it or be disgusted by it. They're response isn't indicative of your goodwill, just of their (un)willingness to accept it. Just don't over-do it."

What I did to alleviate my issues with this was to bring over some of my friends to their pregame, and have them behave a little better.  Well, more people enjoyed us at the bar and we had much more fun.

IWantToLearn,3e0zu0,darknessvisible,6,Tue Jul 21 11:11:38 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking about this and trying it out, and I've concluded that you need to really get to know the person to really compliment them well. A really good compliment is unique to the person. But as you're getting there, here are the things you should try to play with:   •stay away from banal phrases. Like, if this chick is pretty, people have called her beautiful many times before. So maybe look for things besides her appearance to grace. Pretend like you're seeing more than just their superficial/obvious qualities.   • build up your vernacular. Look up synonyms of common praises such as beautiful or smart or watever. You're saying the same thing, but since the one you used is uncommon it's a bit more unique. (Do not use obscure words that other people do not understand. This ruins it)  • Good word usage. Even bigger than the words you use, is how you use it. Read a bit of poetry, like once or twice a year if you're ambitious. Does not need to be a lot. Know some basic techniques, like assonance/alliteration. You're good with knowing only those two. It's also kind of sensible, repeating sounds make things sound nicer to people. You want your sentences themselves to sound pleasant to help make others feel the same.   • Add your own twist to it. If you're lazy/can't come up with something other than ""wow u smart"" in that moment, just try something random. The whole point of a good compliment is that it is unique-  • AND RELATABLE. Anchor your compliment to something real. Say that our of your own experience, or maybe compared certain room, or something you have seen yourself from them. Just like English class, adding support to your statements makes your clauses stronger!   • Pay attention. Learn about them, and keep in mind what they are confident about and more insecure about. Try helping them with what they struggle with.   • It's not really necessary, but I dislike putting people higher by pushing other down. I don't think that's cool.   • More isn't always better. Sweet and concise is best. Don't say too much, but get your point strongly and directly.   • You're body gesture and things! Look them in the eyes, smile, and stuff. If they are one of those types of people who are like ""yea right"" or ""thanks"" but it's obvious they don't believe it themselves, LOOK SERIOUS. And use those banal phrases. In this context those phrases works, because with the serious face/atmosphere it kinda shows the ""there is no funny business here. This is exactly what I say, and I undoubtfully mean. No bullshit."" Makes it more believe able.   So yea, just a lot of little things! Play around and see what kind of style of compliment works best for you. Don't be basic and just add your own spin to them! Ask if you have questions cause I know I suck at explaining this :P   Also this is an abstract skill so I probably may not have been of any help at all, sorry :P"
IWantToLearn,3e0zu0,PeaceTree8D,2,Tue Jul 21 05:18:20 2015 UTC,You don't need to know a person well to compliment them sincerely.  You just need to find something about them that's admirable (mostly easily doable at a glance) and be honest when you admire it.

It really all comes down to genetics and timing of growth spurts but the good news is that everyone tends to even out in the end, some people just get there quicker than others. It's actually quite hard to tell at 13 whos going to be tall and who wont be, just because someone's tall when they're young doesn't mean they'll always be tall, they tend to stop growing earlier.  That's assuming you have access to decent nutrition. You don't have to eat anything special but as long as you're getting everything you need your body will be ready to grow when the spurts hit. Source: I'm far from an expert but I'm a med student currently doing paediatrics and get asked this a lot at the end of consultations.

Your maximum height is determined by genetics, but the time at which you get your growth is different for everyone.   You're right around the age where you'll probably get a lot taller than you are now - but you probably won't ever be ""tall"".   What you can do to make sure your body can do what you want it to do, is to make sure you provide it with:   Adequate sleep (Aim for around 10 hours of sound sleep a night) Water - you should drink enough that you pee very often Protein and nutrients - The building blocks that your body uses to get bigger Exercise.

Phases of malnutrition can temporarily delay  growth but it will resume once you start providing proper nutrition. Of course, even that is not relevant to you because you have access to proper nutrition.   Human Growth Hormone therapy can make you grow taller though.  It's a prescription drug that won't be prescribed to you unless you actually seem to have stunted growth.   Of course, it is available on the black market but it is expensive and no one will sell it to you. Chances are that your parents won't provide you with illegally obtained drugs.   There's also the fact that you are 13. Growth spurts cannot be predicated and can happen at all times. Some people only get them in their late teens. Many basketball stars are among them.   A pediatrician may have access to special equipment that can measure your bone age with ultrasound and thus predict your adult height. By tracking your height throughout your life, they are also able to make good, educated guesses.  Other than that...you can use a simple formula. It's on this website, check it out: http://www.mayoclinic.org/child-growth/expert-answers/faq-20057990  Next time you happen to be at a pediatrician, ask him.

These include (but are not limited to) learning to: lift weights, dress well, take care of your skin, relax in social situations, speak a new language, sell, start a small company, build things, program, perform, do basic maintenance (home, car, bike), backflips, CPR, travel, etc.  Assuming you are a 70 year old man who has already done those things and just wants to spend his twilight years playing FPS:   Get high quality equipment.  You can't build a rocket with stone tools. Study the best in the field incl personally interviewing them. Perfect practice makes perfect.  Look into getting a practice group together and running drills until you are close to perfect. Most FPS is all about map knowledge.  Spend time on one map and learn about common sniper nests and ambush points.  Check online for counter-strats or develop your own. Check for hardware/software mods and other tools players may be using.  I think competitive COD players heavily mod their xbox controllers but I forget how. Teamwork.  Get friends together and run plays.  Decoys and feints.  Coordinate and plan.  Do this well in advance.  Spend rounds just practicing.  Simple is better than complicated. Keep up to date on developments in the industry/league.  What strats are common now?  Which ones are gaining traction?  Check everywhere for commentators and anticipate where the league is going. When you get good, you'll probably start to be aware of who you're playing.  Look into their play history and anticipate their moves.  Assume they will be doing the same and change your own play style. Read the Art of War by Sun Tzu.  Basically, it outlines how to trick people.  I also recommend the 36 strategems."

They are completely different paradigms all together. I highly recommend ""Thinking in Java"" by Bruce Eckel if that is the route you plan on taking. However, languages like Java and C# (aside from a few exceptions) aren't typically languages one would use to write 3D games. Starting with C (a procedural language) would act as a good primer for Object oriented langues in the future.  Also, Unity isn't something you can just pick up and start writing games with... even if you did know a particular language it supports. People get the idea that a ""game engine"" is some magical piece of software that lets you build massive 3D games without much trouble, and that couldn't be further from the truth. It takes teams of dozens of people, with different skill sets, years to make a complex games and programming is only a small portion of what is needed.  ""Thinking in C"" is another great book by Bruce Eckel. I suggest you start there."

Normally when I see people like you I never consider that they may dislike their bullshitting as much as others do. Trust me when I say that other people notice.

This requires you to be aware of what you're doing - you won't notice your thoughts if you're too focused.  I hesitantly recommend meditation, in particular mindfulness meditation to you. I practice it myself, and it does seem to help me notice what is going on in my noggin'.

IWantToLearn,3dwreg,ReliableSource,3,Tue Jul 21 06:29:17 2015 UTC,"You seek attention and you aren't sure how to get it.  This is long; sorry. Sigh.....  Growing up, I had this exact same problem. Some of the stories I told were downright absurd and the only person who ""believed"" me was, well, me. I could relate some of the whoppers I've told in the past but they're all cringe-worthy and quite honestly I'm not particularly fond of revisiting this part of my life. This behavior cost me a lot of things — friends, respect (and self-respect), dignity, and trust. I'm 44 years old now and I still catch myself in the trap every day. It's something like alcoholism, I think; you never completely get over it but you do learn to identify the triggers, consider the repercussions, and control yourself more. More than once I'll find myself starting to reply to a reddit post, then catch myself and close the window. Sometimes I'll have written pages of material. I consider it to be good therapy to see all of that false effort wiped away with the closing of a window.  Somewhat ironically, I have to tell a story to help explain why I don't tell fake stories any more, so you'll have to take at least this part on merit that I'm telling the truth here.  In my case, I told stories in order to make me seem more interesting to others so that they would pay more (positive) attention to me. I had a lot of abandonment issues when I was young; my father and brother both died when I was young, I was the youngest of five children with a 7.5 year gap between me and my closest chronological sibling, my father pretty much hated me, my sisters basically ignored me, my childhood best friend moved away when I was about nine years old, and my other childhood best friend was ""dissuaded"" from associating with me by his insanely-religious (Jewish) parents, seeing me as a bad influence, when I was about 13 years old. I was also identified as a ""gifted"" child when I was around seven or eight years old and my parents were encouraged to put me into special classes that would help me, but since they cost money my father would have nothing to do with it. So I wound up being smarter than my classmates with no significant outlet to apply those gifts to, at least not until I got my hands on a computer — which was simultaneously the best and worst thing to happen to me.  In short, I had very few peers that I could connect with. I felt I had nothing to offer them since that's basically what my childhood upbringing imprinted upon me; between my father's abuse, my sister's ostracizing behavior, and the subtle alienation of my classmates, I grew up believing — firmly — that I had nothing worthwhile to offer.  So, I started compensating. I would make up stories that nobody in my school could dispute or verify in order to make me seem more interesting. When people would ask me questions about it, I'd just make stuff up that seemed right. Like you, I left just enough factual information intact to make it seem plausible. I'd also make sure the timing lined up; for example, my family never went on any kind of family vacation when I was around and I'd often spend weeks if not months hearing about the cool places my classmates went to or activities they did while on summer vacation. So rather than telling my classmates ""I sat around the house all summer and did nothing because all of my friends went away on vacation"" I started telling them about places I've gone to, where I just happened to leave the day after my friends left and returned the day before my friends returned so they never actually saw me leave the house.  Later in life, from late teens to early-to-mid 20's, is when I reached the breaking point. I was a joke with my friends; they all knew I was a bullshitter but nobody would call me on it directly. I always had the better location, the more exciting experience, the best answer to the question — whether it was true or not. I was excluded from many things because people didn't want to deal with me. When my three best friends decided to rent a house together, they were looking for a fourth — and didn't even consider inviting me. Truthfully (as it were) it had gotten neigh impossible for me to keep track of truth from lie; I found myself purposely avoiding actual new experiences because doing so would reveal my lack of experience where I had previously asserted it. (That is to say: Let's say I told someone I spent a weekend on a ski trip, when in reality I have no idea how to ski at all. If at a later point I was asked to go on a ski trip I would have to decline, because if I went then they would see that I had no skiing experience at all and the lie would be laid bare.) This became a huge problem for me and is something that even today I regret.  Many things happened in fairly rapid succession to make me recognize my habit and take steps to correct it. Most of my friends from back then are no longer in touch with me; those who still are have granted me the courtesy and allowed me some measure of dignity by not calling me out on it, though they do understand that I had made some changes in myself. None of my current friends, excepting those aforementioned few, are aware of that part of my past, and I think more than a few would find it hard to believe that I was like that at all.  These days, whenever I want to share something — online or in meatspace — I internally ask myself, ""Why am I sharing this? What does it get me?"" This takes a fraction of a second to process and has been instrumental in keeping my bad habit in check. Like I said, sometimes I'll start to reply to something on reddit when I ask myself those things, and I'll find myself replying: ""There's no reason to share this because it's not true. It's just something else you have to keep track of, something that can leap up and bite me in the ass at a later time. Do I really want to waste my time writing this up for no reason than to share a lie with other people? What do I gain from that?""  Then I close the window and move on.  In spoken conversation, I found that I'm a better conversationalist by listening more than I speak. I realized that when I was speaking a lot (""back then"") I would exaggerate more and more the longer I spoke. A fifteen minute conversation might yield a slight exaggeration or two, but if I was involved in an hour or more conversation I'd be pulling whoppers out of my ass with two fists.  Ultimately, I made four realizations which I think have helped me keep at least a reasonable grounding:   I don't have to be the most interesting person. I don't have to have something to contribute to a conversation. I don't have to know the answer — but it's okay to guess, provided everyone knows you're guessing. If people don't like me because I'm lacking in one of the three previous areas, that's not my shortcoming or my loss.   Seriously, I know exactly what you're going through, so if you need someone to chat with feel free to PM me. Good luck."

In the book, one of the characters relates a story about the former captain of the ship they were on. They had discovered something strange on a planet, and she asked him what to make of it. He simply said ""I don't know.” She said that that honesty was something she really admired about him.   I thought about that a lot. I resolved to do the same, to admit when I didn't know something instead of trying to fake it. Eventually, I got to really like the new habit. First of all I found that people respected and trusted me MORE, not less. Second, and more importantly, whenever that happened I got to learn something instead of creating more bullshit and misinformation in the world. It was a total win-win, and I haven't looked back since.   You're getting some kind of payoff from making up stories for people. Maybe the attention and approval, or even just the thrill of creative flow. I suggest acknowledging to yourself the thing(s) you like about these experiences, and then realizing that you like learning even MORE. It'll change your life.

And in order for this to work, you have to realize that it isn't an optional thing - rather, a necessary part of the high school experience.   Don't be afraid to ask someone for help if you don't understand something either. Talk to your teachers, raise your hand in class.   Eliminate your time sinks. That means reddit. Better yet, use your time sinks as rewards for work. If you do 10 problems on your math work, give yourself one page of reddit content (minus the scroll fests: AMAs, askreddits, etc.). Write one or two pages of that research paper, and complete one multiplayer match. Finish memorizing your psych terms, and complete one turn on Civ.

Maybe do the example problem without looking at the explanation until you attempted it first. Understand the WHY and you'll start to see HOW to solve the problem many ways.

It was easy to be cynical, make fun of people, say spiteful, hateful things. But then one day, I realized I was unhappy with that level of negativity. So, I decided to alter my mindset.  I didn't change the people I hang out with, nor did I stop doing all of the things I normally do, but I decided to stop caring so much about agreeing with their opinions. I started ingesting positive material, I started exercising, I started learning. Whenever something happened, or someone said something silly, I would try shrugging it off, or stop myself to think for a moment that this person has their own reasons for acting this way and they often don't mean to do anything negative. I read ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" and it really gives you an appreciation for other people, how they react on instincts, how everyone is desperate to have a feeling of importance, how everyone wants to save face, and how it is up to you to be the positive one who places their needs before your own, and work with them so you both win. Alot of it has to do with respecting the humanity of other people, and realizing that not everyone is ""an idiot."" As a matter of fact, they're mostly all probably pretty intelligent.   Another thing that I tried to do was cultivate my curiosity and sense of adventure. If a friend of mine was going hiking, rather than focus on the negative (heat, bugs, sweat, stress), I would focus on the positive and just say YES! More often than not, I never regretted the decision to go. Just focus on positive material and people.  Ultimately, I think it's a matter of mindset and self-awareness. If you see yourself going down that path of negativity, stop and think about it for a minute. Try to see the positive in what's in front of you. You have the power to change the way you react to things, to change the way you think about things. I honestly believe that. And I also think it's a very authentic way to approach your life; rather than reacting instinctively, you are seriously considering your life and how you want to approach something, how you want to react. I'm still working on it, but I'm much better for it."

IWantToLearn,3dwobn,AskSomeoneEh,5,Mon Jul 20 03:54:45 2015 UTC,"TL;DR Shortcut: Choose:   1) I want to generally focus on programming: Read A1 and A2. Hire a designer if neccessary, but you're good to go.  2) I want to become a real designer: Read B1 and do B2. Take the time to become one.          A1) Guidelines  If you don't want to dig too deep into design, just check out (and apply!) Google's Material Design Guidelines or Apple's Designing for iOS page.  If you read through and refer back to them while designing, you will likely be consistent with the system's standard and will make it easier for your users to use the app.     A2) Colors & Contrast  Color-wise you might want to check out Adobe Color or Paletton. Both are based on different contrast schemes that work nicely and fit together really well. You choose one and then experiement with different base colors to find something that suits you.   When satisfied, export the RGB codes and use them accordingly in your design.          B1) Digging deeper into design  If that's your goal, you have to make priorities, take your time and become dedicated. It's definitely not worth it if you want to (exclusively) focus on the programming part. In that case, get accustomed to the guidelines (see above) and hire a designer who enjoys designing and is really invested in the topic.   If you however do want to learn how to design great user experiences, I personally    would start getting an intro into (general) design aspects then icon and interface design (look up geometric design here, it's way easier, better and faster than solely relying on the pen tool all the time)  and then check out some UX concepts like user-centered design (UCD) and the techniques used and applied in that concept (contextual inquiry, iterations, evaluation techniques, ...)      Possibilities to learn those aspects are alway quite different and you have to find something that fits your style. The possibilities include (but are not limited to):    (university) courses guided tours like YouTube tutorials (free) and Udemy courses (usually not free) text and image based tutorials. either found on tutorial websites (wouldn't recommend them for basic understanding of design as I never found background information in them) and books. I'd recommend checking for design books on general concepts (psychology of color and shapes, what fits together, design principles like balance, ...)      B2) Learning your craft  Think about designs. Do designs. Rate designs. Get feedback on your designs. In conclusions: get your hands dirty, find out what works when and what doesn't.  It's about getting an eye and feeling about the concepts.   Always try to get useful feedback from both Non-designers and Designers (absorb as much information as you can. the more experiences you get yourself, the more judging you can be on that feedback)  Regarding Non-Designers: don't ask them design questions like ""would you rather have a blue or red icon?"", they are obviously not designers. Instead, focus on understanding their wants & needs, thoughts & feelings, expectations & actions (this is what UX and meaningful design is all about.)  Also stay learning all the time but still use what worked in the past and still works now. New techniques and how to achieve those results in your software of choice, new trends and if they are usefully appliable to your endeavors.           As usual: Feel free to ask any follow-up questions or for more details on one part or another.   Hope I could help!"

You are correct in that protocols will work on IPv6 - this is not an issue. There are a number of reasons why IPv6 has not become more widely used/available:   Availability of IPv4 addresses  Although the final IANA IPv4 address blocks were allocated in February 2011, there is still an availability of IPv4 addresses; they can be purchased (albeit at a higher price due to the depletion) and most companies already own one, and thus see no reason to upgrade to IPv6, as their customers can and do access their services through IPv4 addresses. Lack of need to migrate  Few systems need to be migrated to IPv6, and in most cases, migration is expensive, requires time, and does not yield clear short-term return. Systems work on IPv4, temporary systems such as NAT were developed to prolong the depletion of IPv4 addresses and are still used widely today.  Migration is already happening  As an end user, you will most likely not see most of what is happening with the ongoing development and implementation of IPv6. Many ISPs began working on IPv6 support years ago, and a few have already implemented support; Windows has supported IPv6 since 2000; the IPv6 protocol is constantly being developed and reviewed, but the internet will continue to function without the immediate implementation and adoption of IPv6, and thus you will likely notice no change.   That said, if you want to 'use' IPv6, you might already be doing so; you can test your own support for IPv6 on various sites across the web. However, what is important to bear in mind is that the majority of websites do not currently use IPv6 (for reasons mentioned above) - currently, only 16% of Alexa Top 1000 websites use IPv6, although this number will likely increase in the foreseeable future. In addition, many ISPs do not provide IPv6 addresses, so you may not be able to 'use' IPv6 in this sense either."

IWantToLearn,3dtcij,WizardMorax,2,Mon Jul 20 11:34:50 2015 UTC,"A big part of something sounding ""professional"" is the recording quality. You need a good mic, a good recording space, a good interface etc... From there using something like Audacity to edit stuff is fine. Playing around with the options, learning where exactly to make cuts, etc... Most of that takes practice and experimentation. Sometimes if means having a good ear and being creative with some of the effects.  The first step is usually having decent recording equipment though, and that's often why people pay for studio time."
IWantToLearn,3dtcij,ObscureGecko,2,Sun Jul 19 17:05:55 2015 UTC,"This is the big answer. If you're using crappy lapel mics, your audio is always going to be low quality. You want to find a high-quality mic that's suited for your purposes with a good wind screen. (For indoor use, I've always had better luck with the round screens that clip onto a stand, rather than the windjammer sock or foam kind that goes over your mic.) This page gives you a good idea of what kind of direction you want out of your mic, and this page has some good reading on the basic types of mics and how to use them.  You may want to have a soundboard that you can play with a little bit for mixing levels, but if you're just recording speaking and not singing, then it's not always a necessity. For some more in-depth answers, you might try x-posting this over to /r/techtheatre. They'll probably be able to point you to the exact kind of mics you may want, and give you some pro tips on how to improve the quality. EDIT to say that if possible, you'll want to mic everyone separately. That helps keep everyone sounding loud and clear, and also omnidirectional mics sometimes like to listen to the AC and air currents just as much as they like listening to people, and that's sometimes the cause of ""white noise"" in the background of recordings.  The big thing here is that with film, you can play with the lighting, some filters,  special effects, or whatever you don't like the look of in post. With music you can filter out reverb or EQ the mics on certain instruments to pick up/filter out certain parts of the sound. But with audio of someone speaking, the best you can do is record the sound exactly as it comes. And for that, the easiest, and often the only, thing you can do is to have a high-quality way of recording it."

I recommend doing hand and arm exercises to get more flexible and remove stiffness from like daily use of computer. For the beginning a teacher can really help. Both motivational and for learning. You'll also have to memorize all the notes/read notes. For singing IMO do an indepth course at one of you music schools lead by a professional.

Submit content regularly, even if it feels like nobody is listening to you. People are way, waay more willing to comment than submit new content. And people often spend more time reading comments than they do the actual content. Commenters are your bread 'n butter. If you're seeing a lot of the same/recycled content, FIGURE OUT HOW TO MODERATE IT. /r/visualnovels used to be filled with ""I just finished my first VN. What now?"" style posts. After recommendation threads were banned, there was maybe less content for a while, but it was more topical and interesting and was a sub people could genuinely stay interested in. I guess that's ""sacrificing short term profits for long term growth"" or w/e. Obviously, you need to strike a balance with this. A sticky that's up forever is like the sidebar. People wind up ignoring it and ""it's just rules or w/e."" Stickies on rotation, however, make it look like there's always something noteworthy happening. Make yourself available and actively participate in the community. Oftentimes, people will talk about mods but never with them, because commenting on reddit is so prominent and the moderator list in the sidebar is so small and you don't even know what they're like and it'd be awkward and... ""State of the subreddit""/AMA-style posts where you talk about rules or whatever achieve this pretty well. Promote the shit out of it. I'm sure there are subs for that. Try to get another similar sub to link to you in their sidebar/wiki. Don't start a sub, put five tons of effort into it for like, a week, then decide it's not working out and forget about it.

Anyway while I dont really change up the sub much. Over the years it's grown from a heavily spam infested 4,000 subs to a minorly spam infested 30,000 subs. The main thing that helped that were:  A) Driving traffic from established subs (....ie my original plan) B) Some effective design. If you design it, they will come. Doesnt matter how much but just a little bit to set it off from others C) Active contributors. Basically if you have a niche sub and it's interesting ask the userbase to contribute. D) A really nice submission. If this gets to all then you can gain subs that way. E) Relevant subreddit mentions in larger sub. Such as in /r/askreddit F) Getting enough activity where you become a trending subreddit will list you on the frontpage for a day G) Being SFW likely will help in the future because reddit loves advertising money alot more these days. H) Having the most popular name or easy to remember I) Recruiting users to post on your sub helps. J) Recruiting mods to build your sub can help as well.

Performance optimization... you might want to start down an engineering path.  Design... Other end of the spectrum. Start taking art courses.  Here are some resources that will give you a very broad and general idea of what kind of challenges you'd be working with as an engineer:  https://www.youtube.com/user/EngineeringExplained  Start searching for ""XXXX factory tour"" if you want to see what kind of work engineers deal with on a daily basis. Most of the companies you mention only hire the cream of the crop, so start studying. Engineers or Assembly/Production Specialists at McLaren and others often work in clean-room type environments and demand someone who has impeccable focus and dedication.  Read jalopnik.com and oppositelock.com daily. I had to stop because it was taking up too much of my time.  Here in the USA, a technical school might be the place to start, but you have to A) have money and B) be really good at what you do. I know many people who spent $100,000 on an education at a technical institute only to come out working at the car audio section of Best Buy. I know one who was inducted into Mercedes' program. He's been with them for like, 8 years or so and his main job is still to park cars at a dealership.  If you're college-age, most large colleges have some sort of Formula SAE or Baja SAE program in the engineering department. This is probably one of the best things you can work towards if you have that opportunity. Unfortunately I haven't gone to school yet, but to participate on one of those teams is the driving force behind wanting to go back and potentially change my career. There is where you'll really get a taste for what the industry is all about, from the business, research, development, fabrication, finish, and racing. You will likely get stuck in one or few particular jobs depending on the size of the team, but you will be exposed to many aspects of the industry.  Find and participate in an awesome car forum. There are generalized forums, specific model forums, campervan forums... Most of them have technical discussions. There's a lot of good information about performance on Honda-Tech, for example, but also a lot of bad so verify anything you read.  Artistic Design, if that's what you meant... I don't know much about design. I know it's probably important to be extremely talented, and to submit to as many Local Motors or similar competitions as you can. =P There are automotive design programs at some schools, but you'll probably have to look hard. It also helps to have some engineering background, because you will be working directly with engineers to refine designs, and characteristics of airflow often comes in handy when designing...   Personal projects - buy a project car. It helps to have an end-goal in sight. I have about 8 cars sitting around that I don't really know what I want to do with. It's overwhelming.

You might plan for the future:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZZGpMjJr4A  Or the past.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FFbIcWmo34  You might be able to improve safety for drivers, pedestrians, or improve the flow of traffic.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge4rG8ER_CU  If you've always been interested in cars, you might already know Top Gear, but go back and watch all the episodes to keep that passion going. Just don't blindly follow their biased comedic advice, get out and figure things out for yourself.  I had an ""in"" once...  I saw an ad online looking for someone to fill a low-paying position at a race development shop. When I showed up the position was filled, but I kept showing up and I'd just pick up a broom and bug the crap out of the guy. I offered to work for free, helping swap engines or whatever. He finally let me hang out for a day or two and after that noticed my work ethic and that I was passionate. He started paying me on the third day (with back pay) and I would go there after work once or twice a week and do odd jobs like making a fiberglass roof mold or forming a sheet-metal air dam (learning as I went along). I was soon machining brackets, solving problems, and contributing designs to BMW M3 racecars! I was offered a full-time position in his dad's CAD design company as an entry-level engineer (with no school or experience, just basic CAD knowledge for my own pursuits) with the stipulation that I walk out into the shop and help there after work (for additional pay), but I had different plans at the time in the form of more money in my existing industry and plans to move to an area I like more. I still keep in touch with him, and when he does endurance races in my part of the state, I join for pit crew. I helped him swap a transmission in 2 hours last time, which dropped us from 6th overall to 38th in a 25 hour race, but it was an experience I'll remember for the rest of my life. I wrangled a bunch of friends into helping and stayed up for 39 hours that weekend. Fast-paced team building like I've never experienced!  That was my in, with virtually no experience but tons of passion. Most anyone can achieve what they want, just be persistent and be willing to put yourself out there.  Good luck!"

Pick ONE thing you want to learn first and then go out and learn it. Google can be your friend.  Organize and come up with a plan on how you want to go about your learning. Do you want to learn online? Khan Academy is good for basics in STEM subjects. Would you rather take classes? Look at community colleges as well as some of the companies in your area for extra curriculars. There might also be clubs for you to join which will have communities that you can get to know which also will keep you motivated.  Basically pick something you want to learn and just go with that for awhile until you are either confident in that subject or you find you want to learn something else. Limit your scope.

There are many different versions of Linux, which are known as ""distributions,"" (or more commonly abbreviated as ""distros""). Depending on what distro you chose, you will be forced to learn how the operating system works and how every piece of the operating system is linked with each other. If you are confused about something, or simply need some help, then don't be afraid to Google it! Pretty much any issue that you will have with Linux can be answered within seconds on a forum or on one of the excellent distribution specific wikis that are out there. Even if you don't end up using Linux as a daily driver, you will come of the experience with much more knowledge about software and operating systems than you did before. If you do not want to wipe your current operating system in favor of Linux, you can always install your distro of choice using a virtual machine on your current operating system."

You can branch out to the rest of IT pretty easy if you master a lot of the functionality of a Pi.    Pi's have a low floor for getting up and running and a high ceiling of capabilities.

IWantToLearn,3dmhto,marcmc1,9,Fri Jul 17 23:11:22 2015 UTC,"Hardware and build: Watch LinuxTechTips (https://www.youtube.com/user/LinusTechTips) from the beginning. After that you know a pretty good amount for anything related with hardware. Then get a budget and build your first own rig. There really is not much to it, think of it as Lego, just with more pricy stuff to connect (and no bleeding feet!). If you built the first rig, the second one gets much easier. The third one is almost routine; the fourth one is for a friend; the sixth one might be yours again. It's not accurate, but that's how it usually works.  Operating Systems: If you really want to dig into OS, I recommend Linux. Any distro will do at the beginning (I can recommend OpenSuse 13.2, but even Ubuntu or Linux Mint will do fine). Fiddle around, break shit, repair it. Later on, do an personal Linux from Scratch build, thats pretty much as hardcore as it gets (except programming your own OS), but you will learn a lot. Linux is only proverbally one click away from direct hardware communication (its more complex than that though). With the command line and you can do anything and learn TONS of stuff. This is relatively easy to learn, but very hard to master. Be prepared to sit hours on simple solutions. The more time you invest, the faster it goes. The most helpful site in my opinion is the Arch Linux Wiki: https://wiki.archlinux.org/  Software: Learn a coding language. Python seems to be a good start. There is not much I can tell you, I only dipped my feet in JavaScript and now my ways around HTML/PHP. There are many good books on the market and free online courses.

Mind you: If you can't use or are to lazy to use search engines, don't bother trying to get into this stuff. Search enigines are a blessing and a curse, but try to use them as much as you can.

I'm kind of been looking into learning how to micro solder for exchanging broken connectors, etc., maybe I could even start a business off of this, I have no idea. But I would like to know, do you think there is a market for this? I'm in Canada, just in case it's relevant.  What really got me interested in this idea was doing a screen/digitizer replacement on my Samsung Galaxy s4.   I got a cheap part on ebay and unbeknownst to me the flex cable on the replacement was installed crookedly so when I tried to clip it into my motherboard connector I pushed too forcefully and I bent a couple pins. Once I realized and plugged the flex cable in at a severe (but correct) angle I got the screen to work but the touch is unresponsive.   Now I can either learn to solder and replace the connector (looks to be super cheap) or buy a whole new screen/digitizer assembly (~$80-180) and junk the old one just because of the one connector I mangled.  Other question, how would one go about getting the hands-on practice to repair electronics? I don't know anyone with spare electronics to tinker with, except myself. Do cellphone repair centres normally have parts that are broken that they wouldn't need that I could either learn to solder on or practice repairing?  I'm struggling to find employment now that I've graduated during an economic downturn in my field and I can't afford to pay anyone more than a few dollars for their junk parts."
IWantToLearn,3dloo7,essellburns,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:57:22 2015 UTC,"Hi!   I'm in the UK so keep in mind I don't know your exact market conditions, popular models or warranty processes.   My suggestion would be to get a job at a warranty repair centre for one of the major manufacturers. There's no better way to learn the trade.   Soldering is a valuable skill but may phones, especiall iPhones, are modular and the parts are so cheap there's simply no reason to spend the time on Soldering, usually. There are exceptions. I suspect your Samsung screen is not one of them though. To resolder to a high enough quality would be very challenging especially for a first project.   Items like Samsung s3 charging ports, or Sony charging ports are more valuable to learn to solder. Sim readers too but they're a step up in complexity. IPhone battery connections, also worth being able to do.   I don't think you could build a viable business just on Soldering but that's a guess as I don't have enough info. But why would you when replacing screens on an iPhone will make you good money and it's a lot less labour! Soldering takes time, hours in some cases.   Practice electronics.. I get them from customers so perhaps you could make friends with a repair shop if you have those. And there's always the ""for spares and repairs"" section on eBay.  Edit. Just a thought. If you like I could post you a half dozen unrepairable phones. I have plenty laying about and scrap value is peanuts.

I've made an ad on kijiji in my local area asking for junk parts but I'm not sure anyone will bite as I'm not offering to pay them anything for them.  I assume you have insurance for your company but how do you handle situations where you damage a customers product, for example, as I did with my own samsung s4? Do you keep at least one extra part for everything you are fixing in case if this happens? I think this is my biggest fear with this business idea. I love tinkering with electronics but I've not got the steadiest hands (mind you part of it might also be because I was trying to hold my loupe in one hand and the parts in the other and the lens is so tiny it kept going out of focus, what a mess I am). I'm absolutely going to get one of those ""helping hands""/""third hands"" somewhere before I attempt anything else though.  I wasn't aware there was a ""for spares and repairs"" section of eBay! I'll definitely have to check it out, it sounds very useful.  How did you get into this business, if you don't mind me asking?"
IWantToLearn,3dloo7,essellburns,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:34:07 2015 UTC,"No worries, I've just sent a big shipment of scrap to be recycled but there's always a steady flow of more coming in. I'll likely give it till next Saturday to build up so I can send a range of items over.   We don't have any insurance, instead we pay out of pocket for anything we damage. It's frustrating when it happens but thankfully it's rare. We do warranty our work and most of the free work we have to do is because the part we've fitted is faulty. Getting quality parts without paying an excessive premium is a constant struggle.   On very rare occasions we've had to replace a customers phone. This is easier for us than for you since we also buy and sell the handsets. But typically so as you're careful with the motherboard everything else in the phone is fixable. If the issue is with the motherboard either advise the customer the repair is not worth the price or warn them of the risks!   Yes, those helping hands are essential for the detailed work. make sure the grips are coated with something so you're not gripping metal over electronics.   On eBay it's a category of products. They do new, used, busted up. Some people ask crazy money for broken and some are reasonable. With time and experience you'll recognise the ones you can buy, fix up and sell on. But it's always a gamble because faults can mislead you about the cause. For any given behaviour there's more than one possible issue causing it. E.g. The phone works but the battery discharges in about an hour. 95% of the time that's a faulty battery. But it can also be the main board is shorting and sucking the life from the battery. In RL you'd be able to tell because the phone would overhead but on eBay it's difficult.   I got into it by accident like all my jobs! I started in a phone shop in 1996, just part time for pocket money while I was a student. Liked it and stayed, eventually managing a shop for nine years. When that company closed down I did a bit of work for an insurance company, testing and assessing damaged phones. After three years of that one of the guys who used to work for me in the shop opened a repair shop and asked me to run it for him. I learned all my repair skills from youtube initially, my experience in the industry helped me diagnose the issues. Three years later I've learned plenty from playing with phones and from some staff we've taken on that had training. Once you get the principals then each phone is just a variation on a theme.   Repairing phones is easier than most people think. It's practice that let's you do so reliably enough to make it a business.   Good luck."

The first one I reputed was my friend's 4th gen iPod touch. I messed up a little but he was ok with it (I also did it pro bono) and he ended up cracking it again in two weeks. So it was a good starter project. Since then I have repaired countless 4S's for my friends and started a side 'business' in school through word of mouth. People would crack their screens and their friends would tell them about me. I charged for parts and labor but made sure I was cheaper than the mall kiosk or the Apple Store. All in all it was a fun side business and I still do it occasionally for coworkers and such. I would recommend working on iPhone 4S's initially because they're pretty straight forward and less glue-happy than iPod touches or newer iPhones (plus 4S parts are dirt cheap now).

IWantToLearn,3dojje,lissomeingenue,3,Fri Jul 17 23:28:36 2015 UTC,"Find farms in your area, either through farmers markets or Google. If possible, visit them. Most well-tended farms will welcome you if you contact them. If they don't, they might have something to hide.  If you find one you like, availability is the next problem. Farmer's markets are rarely year round. For this reason, among others*, I recommend you look into purchasing in bulk. That means in hog or half-hog quantities from your chosen producer. For a processing fee, the pig will come in whatever cuts you ask for. Pork lasts very well in a good freezer.   *It forces you to get into learning to cook and eat the lesser cuts. DIY nose-to-tail eating is beyond the scope of this answer, though.  As an aside, brand names and stores* are bad metrics, as is any 'organic' labelling. There isn't any independent oversight of these entities beyond the USDA, which only protects from the basic illness. Government exists to protect you, not animals. Transparency on the part of the seller is necessary.  *Outside of any very localized store, but that requires your own investigation.  Buying ethically raised meat is difficult. It requires you to get closer to the source than most 1st-worlders are really comfortable with.  Edit: It's also expensive. Like 6$/lb and beyond expensive. Because meat should be an expense, after all you're killing something for your enjoyment. Living vegetarian outside of one meat-day is an admirable way to live.

You may still feel that spike of adrenaline with physical confrontations, but you'll also feel more in control because every other day you'll be in the ring fighting someone.  Another avenue would probably be a debate team of sorts.

IWantToLearn,3dipcc,mb94,140,Thu Jul 16 16:18:42 2015 UTC,"Key concepts:   One room at a time. Top-to-bottom. A place for everything and everything in its place.   When you go in for a deep clean (once a month or so), get a box and label it DOESN'T BELONG IN HERE. In each room, if you encounter something that belongs somewhere else (maybe you left a few glasses on your nightstand, for instance), put that thing in the box. When you finish cleaning the room you're in, go put the things in the box where they belong. This will keep you from getting sidetracked by other messes or distracted by tasks that aren't cleaning.  Overview of what needs to be done in each room:   Bedroom: Put dirty clothes in a hamper to be washed. Fold or hang clean clothes (iron if necessary), and put them where they belong. Make the bed. Throw away trash. If you have piles of random shit stacked on your dresser/night stand/desk/any other flat surface, go through those piles and figure out where all that random shit goes (use the box).  Bathroom: Clean the toilet. This means both inside the bowl and out, and both sides of the seat. Wipe all that nasty hair and associated grime off the back. Clean the sink (including faucet and drain), and the counter around the sink - take all the stuff off the counter and put it somewhere else, don't just clean around them. Clean the walls and floor in the shower/tub, as well as the faucet, drain, and the showerhead. If the showerhead is super nasty, you can put some white vinegar in a Ziplock bag, put the bag over the showerhead and use rubberbands to secure it. Let it soak for a few hours, then wipe clean. Clean the mirrors. Sweep and mop the floor. Kitchen: Put away clean dishes. Wash and dry the dirty ones, and put them away, too. Clean the sink and countertops just like you did in the bathroom - move your countertop appliances and clean under them, not just around them. Speaking of those countertop appliances, clean those, too. Wipe down the outside with a wet paper towel. Your toaster should have a tray on the bottom that pulls out; if it doesn't, dump it out into the trash - it's full of burnt crumbs. Run a solution of 1 part white vinegar to 2 parts water through your coffeemaker. Repeat that process with just water a few times to rinse out the vinegar. Clean the carafe and the filter cup with soap and water, too. If your oven is self-cleaning, run the self-clean cycle; otherwise, getcha some oven cleaner and start scrubbin' and scrapin', boy. Clean the stovetop; this'll require some disassembly on your part if you have an electric. Wipe down the fridge and freezer inside and out - again, take out everything and clean under, not just around. Sweep and mop the floor. Living/family rooms: Put everything that was left in here that doesn't belong in the box. Clothes, shoes, dishes, bags, etc. Throw away trash. Clean end tables, coffee tables, dining room tables. Vacuum upholstered furniture (couches and chairs with cushions). Clean lampshades and curtains. Wipe dust off of electronics. Put away movies, games, consoles and accessories, etc. Vacuum the floor. Any Room: Got a ceiling fan? Turn that bitch off and dust her. It'll be gross, just drop the dust worms on the floor because you're going to vacuum them up later. If there are stains on the walls/floor/furniture, figure out how to clean them - what works best depends on what the stain is made of and how long it's been there, Google is your friend. Vacuum the floor last, always.   EDIT: Thanks for popping my gold cherry, /u/Angelus414! You are a gentle[wo]man and a scholar."

IWantToLearn,3dipcc,Jennynot,5,Thu Jul 16 17:19:43 2015 UTC,"There's a reason why cleaning and organization are professions because one can become an expert in the minutiae. I believe in keeping it simple. Once you get the basics down, it'll become second nature.  Work your way through your apartment in stages. Depending on how complex your place is, you could get overwhelmed if you try to tackle it all at once. The steps are all the same no matter the situation. It's about making decisions. You're already a pro if you decided you want to have a clean apartment.     Is it trash/recycling? Throw it away or put it in recycle. Is it something to donate? Gather it all and put it near your front door so you can take it out the next time you run errands. Is it something you want to keep? Make a home for your things and respect that space; i.e., clean clothes are folded or put on a hanger, dirty clothes go in the hamper, clean dishes go on the shelf, dirty dishes go in the sink, etc. Do you need to do something to your stuff (pay it, return it to its owner, wash it, mend it)? Never go to bed with dishes in the sink. Pay your bills as they come in or as you get paid. Resist the temptation to just leave dirty clothes on the floor. Separate them into darks and lights as you go. Wash weekly. Do you have the basic things you need to keep your place clean? Always have trash bags (no bigger than 13-gallon), window cleaner, all-purpose cleaner (409), broom & dust pan, paper towels or rags, dish soap, cleanser (Comet), dishwashing brush, separate brush for cleaning bathtub/shower, toilet bowl cleanser and brush. With regard to trash cans, someone once said, “Trash cans are like babies: keep them close and change them often.” Make sure your kitchen has a separate bin for recycling and a trash can with a lid. Since you live in an apartment, I imagine there’s a dumpster on property. Take out the trash twice a week.   As mentioned, these are the highlights. I hope they help. Good luck!"

Protip: if you have a dishwasher but always hand wash dishes use your dishwasher as a drying rack.   Vacuum your carpet floors once a week and sweep other surfaces after you vacuum, make sure you sweep out under counters and your refrigerator.

IWantToLearn,3dipcc,alesair,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:04:34 2015 UTC,"There are lots of great suggestions here!  I'm totally going to steal some of these.  I also never learned how to clean as a child and had to figure out what to do and when to do it as an adult.  I tended to ignore all cleaning for days/weeks/months and then have huge stressful marathon cleaning sessions whenever I'd realize how messy the space had become--not fun!  Now I usually have a better handle on things (thanks, automatic calendar reminders!) but it still isn't something that comes naturally to me.  I definitely use checklists and self-rewards and often feel like a 5-year-old (who needs to be reminded by a computer to do basic adult chores?  ME, and I WILL wear my gold star when I'm done, thankyouverymuch) but it's a whole lot better than where I started and I no longer panic when someone wants to come over.  Something that has really helped me to KEEP my place more tidy is re-structuring my environment to fit the habits I already have, rather than trying to change my whole routine.  I would love to be the kind of person who can just change my habits easily and consistently, but I don't want to live in a gross environment while I struggle with self-improvement, so I've made some compromises.  For example, having a trashcan in every room helps avoid just setting trash on any flat surface, and having his-and-hers hampers near where we each undress cuts down on random piles of clothes.  It might look dumb to have two hampers within 12 feet of each other, but it's better than one hamper and one mountain of dirty clothes.  I try to make it as easy (or easier) to do the tidy thing as it is to do the messy one, like leaving the dishwasher door open when the dishwasher is empty.  So annoying to have to lean over the open door to put my dishes on the counter, so, might as well just put them actually in the darn thing!    I have also started storing things near where I use them most, rather than where I think they ""should"" be stored, because I am more likely to put them away right after use if it's convenient to do so.  For example, I groom my own dog, and used to keep the brushes, clippers, etc. in the bathroom with the dog shampoo, so that it was ""all together.""  However, even though I obviously bathe the dog in the bathtub, I tend to brush and trim the dog on the back porch for easier clean-up, and therefore I was always leaving my brushes etc. on the kitchen counter (the first room I entered as I came back into the house).  Not compatible with pet-hair-free cooking!  So now I have a storage area for my tools in the garage (also adjacent to the back porch, and not used for food prep), and even though part of me feels like I should be mature enough to just put them back where they ""belong"" another part of me has accepted that consistently putting things away in two places is better than haphazard care of my stuff/contaminating food.  So now whenever I'm tidying up, I try to notice when I'm moving the same objects repeatedly ""back where they belong"" to see if maybe I should move ""where they belong"" instead.    I also have difficulty remembering to do a little bit of cleaning every day to avoid stuff building up, so I've started having little races with myself during instances where I'm ""forced"" to wait.  Heating something up in the microwave?  Let's see if I can unload/reload the dishwasher, take the trash to the curb, vacuum the living room, or some other time-appropriate challenge before it beeps.  Baking?  Can I sort the mail and pay the bills or sweep and mop the floor before it's cookie time?  Hulu commercial?  Let's grab all the abandoned dishes/dog toys/whatever clutter is in the general vicinity while we wait for the show to come back.  When I clean, I tend to get distracted by minutia to the detriment of the bigger picture.  Therefore, when I have a lot to do or a deadline (guest coming over, etc), I employ my patent-pending Pee-Pomodoro technique.  Regular pomodoro technique involves setting a timer to certain intervals and allowing yourself little breaks every so often to reward yourself and re-focus, but I can't be trusted to remember to re-set the timer.  So I just consume a caffeinated beverage (yay cleaning energy!) and then whenever I have to pee it forces me to stop doing what I'm doing and re-evaluate my priorities--is it really important that the DVDs are in alphabetical order when the top of the TV is still all dusty and the carpet still needs to be vacuumed?  Why am I in the bedroom when I've set the goal of cleaning the living room today?  Am I reading the magazines I'm supposed to be tidying up?    I'm still a lazy heathen at heart, but I've thankfully developed enough cleaning-fu to live in an environment that would pass health codes and doesn't usually embarrass me when folks come over.

IWantToLearn,3dkmen,dcompare,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:21:31 2015 UTC,"Practice makes perfect. My suggestion would be the following two methods:  Invite Critqiue: Find someone you feel comfortable enough to ask to critique something about you, but not someone so close that it can create tension, e.g. a friendly coworker.  Critique Yourself: Whenever you make a mistake, take a second to notice it. Don't pile on or try to ignore your mistake, just notice and accept it. That is essentially what we do with everyone else. When someone you know makes a mistake, do you obsess about it? You shouldn't and probably don't, and I can tell you that most people around you, especially those that care for you, don't obsess about your mistakes. They just notice and let go. That is what you should do. When someone offers a criticism, it is usually only to make you notice some behavior that you might not be noticing. So notice it, show appreciation, and move on. If you feel you would like to change it, you will recall the behavior in the next instance and have the potential to avoid it. If the person's criticism was not valuable to you, then there is no need to dwell on it."

You might discover that producing is just not for you, so it would be a lot of wasted money. Try a demo if you're not comfortable with pirating.  As for learning music theory, I'd say that's not necessery. You can learn the most stuff on the internet, and you might even enjoy making genres that aren't chord driven, like deep house or similar stuff.  Generally everything you need to learn to get started producing is to be found on youtube.   I'm using FL Studio which has a fairly easy learning curve. Ableton live would be my second recommendation."

I'm a total noob, so it's pretty discouraging."
IWantToLearn,3djaot,comfortcreature999,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:58:02 2015 UTC,"You don't really. Download Ableton/FL studio, download some sample packs that have what you need (kicks/percussion/synths/risers/sweeps)  and get a few plugins like Massive (is pretty advanced to start out with if you JUST got into making music. There's a lot of guides on youtube for it tho, so you can use them to rip of some synths, which will make your music sound more proffesional right off the bat).   You can search for ""must have plugins"" or something like that on edmproduction.  I'm not using any equipment myself, it's just me and my mouse. So I'm clicking everything in there. You don't need a keyboard at all.  A thing you should learn is equalizing. If all the sounds are in the same frequency, it's gonna muddy up your sound, so you can't hear what sound is actually what. Say you have a hi-hat sample that you found - add an equalizer to the sound (one with a visual interface), it'll show you the entire frequency spectrum. If you see it has some bass to it, cut out the bass. This makes more ""space"" for the low end sounds like your kick and bassline. You can also boost the frequencies which can be useful for giving things more treble/high end or more lower frequencies.  Sidechaining is term you should learn as well. It's used in pretty much all house/dance music. Look it up on youtube and you'll find out what it is.  These are not things that you HAVE to know to make music if you just started. Just go play around with the program, make some chords and melodies and whack in a fat kick. Add some wonky samples and put some effects on them - reverb/delay/chorus, see what they make the samples sound like.   But, you have to learn them eventually, and the sooner the better, because it'll help you make stuff that sounds more proffesional.  Hope you can use my wall of text for something."

If you're looking to do things live, then a keyboard first, and a drum pad next, is a good investment.  Nothing too fancy. Just a midi keyboard, probably one that has USB built in.  If you're looking to just write music, then a mouse is good enough.

Then, choose a note from the major scale and listen to that note played across 8 or so octaves. Then do a different note, then back to the scale. Then back to the individual notes, then the scales, then the notes, then the scales and so on and so on.  The idea here is that you are giving yourself a chance to hear a note played in relationship to other notes, and the same note in relationship to itself across the octave range.

The poison is the antidote: Seek out absurdity. Nothing chaotic or dangerous like running out into traffic, but perhaps standing on the side of the road dancing and waving at the traffic while holding a sign that reads ""Staple Remover."" This kind of thing can get into your bones. By experiencing something that is ostensibly meaningless and futile with intention, you might give yourself the opportunity to confront the value of such a behavior. Two things though: BE CAREFUL! Don't do something that offends or puts others in danger, or yourself. You might run into a crazy who wants to end you for being weird. I got a knife pulled on me for requesting a cigarette from someone once. Second thing, make it personal. Think of something that makes no sense to you specifically and try it.  Next piece of advice: old people. People who have something to share with you about what they will miss when they are about to croak can make you see why its important to seek joy while you have a chance. Our elders have loved, dreamed, lost, strove, erred, and they are at a moment in their lives where they know the answer to how it all ends for them. The weight of their regrets, cherished memories, and even hopes can bend even the firmest obstinate.  Poetry: Poetry is beauty converted into the logic of language. There is poetry about everything, even logic and nihilism. I recommend Billy Collins. His poems are funny, haunting, witty, and playful. His books are usually pretty short and inexpensive. Poets.org, anything really. Reading poetry can help you bridge the logic and the illogical, absurd, whatever.   Accept who you are/My experience: I am a very logical thinker. I spend lots of time trying to discern a more efficacious means of nurturing my animal's physical health and sometimes have to remember to make him happy too. I spent my teenage years raging at everyone around me because I felt like they put to much value on things that seemed completely pointless to me. Friendship often felt like work because I felt smarter than everyone, and what others spent their time interested in had no value at all to me. I didn't understand family, I didn't see why holidays were meaningful, and I didn't care for people who hadn't thought out everything as thoroughly as I had. All of this was a character flaw called impatience. Other people's lives and values seemed meaningless because I had never taken the time to explore them, and when they brought them up or showed them to me, because I did not see the value, I wrote them off as meaningless before trying them myself. Even asserting a smidge of effort, and it is an effort, on those things seemed wasteful. Today, I don't care if life is meaningless anymore because I have given it meaning. Whether I understand why others insist on ""finding"" meaning or ""knowing themselves"" or whatever, I have, using these methods, found some meaning for myself.   Those are my suggestions and I wish you luck."

You need questions, and you need to seek answers to those questions. That is all. Again, go back to my initial response. In the end, we wound up asking some basic questions about how to make an all crust sandwich, and we answered those questions one by one until we had an answer to everything we needed to know.   That is what your journey to understand how to solve your problem will be like. Whether it is in electrical engineering, poetry, athletics, it does not matter. Questions->Research, Research->Answers, Answers->Actions, and Actions->Goals.   Your first question needs to be what does my product need to do? How is it going to do it. You do not need education in electrical engineering to solve electrical engineering problems. You need education in electrical engineering to solve electrical engineering problems quickly and efficiently enough for you to be useful to a company.   About a year ago I had an idea for a product that I wanted to make, but I didn't know how. Since then I have spent my spare moments researching answers to the questions I have such as ""How does a PCB relay work"" and ""What is the difference between volts and amps."" Today, I am organizing several tests of the principles on which my product will operate and preparing to learn 3D modelling so I can construct a prototype. At some point I hope to have a prototype finished that I can show to investors and put together a little business. I don't know how that is going to unfold; I just have questions that I spend my time answering.  Think of it this way: Imagine your journey to creating your product as a drive in the dark down a desolate country road. There are no sign posts, no other cars, just you, your head lights, and a few dozen feet of road stretched out in front of you. You can't see the end of the road, and the path you have taken so far is just a fuzzy memory already. To make it to the end of that road, you don't need to see the end of it, and it is so far and so dark that you couldn't if you tried. You just need those few dozen feet of road in front of you, follow them where they take you and you will arrive where they lead. Mile by mile, question by question, answer by answer."

She then recommended a PT. Then I went in and described where it hurt and when. She (the PT) gave me several exercises to do, including lifting some light weights and stretches. I continued to see her every week or so for about six weeks, explaining to her what was working and what wasn't. Then she helped me figure out how to do the exercises better and have me additional exercises where appropriate. She also instructed me on how to sit and hold myself better. She also would do some massage to help relieve pain.  After six weeks, as long as all is going well, I don't see her until I have another flare up. Make sure they are qualified and that they are examining you and listening to you - that is the most important thing. If they have a solution before you even walk in, out they aren't helping, look for someone else. Not sure where you are at, but your primary care provider should be able to provide recommendations if you are in the USA."

If you can write every letter in the alphabet, you have the manual articulation to draw anything. The hard part is translating what you see, or imagine, into shapes, lines, and shades. You have to break an image into these elementary parts and observe how they flow as a cohesive image.   I suggest drawing along with YouTube videos that teach gesture drawing. Once you draw something, draw it again. Try different angles, different lighting. Say, 5 - 20 drawings a day of the same thing. Once you have basic forms down, start looking at more advanced tutorials. Work on one thing at a time: shape, perspective, shading, etc. as you move on to another principle, keep refining the ideas you have already worked on."

IWantToLearn,3d70n8,oversloth,3,Tue Jul 14 11:06:31 2015 UTC,Lazify uses last.fm's API which provides much better results. Also Spotify tends to create a station of around 25 or so songs then repeats them sometimes even in the exact same order. With Lazify you define how many songs/how long you want it to go and they'll whip up a playlist for you.  Another neat app (seriously spotify getting rid of app support was fucked) is Setlistener which you type in a band and it will create a playlist based on one of the bands recent set lists.  http://static.echonest.com/SetListener/

It seems like you have already been doing this with Youtube suggestions and stuff, so maybe try exploring more obscure genres of music?  Dig through lesser known genre specific subreddits until you find something you like.    http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/wiki/musicsubreddits  Listen to stuff you wouldn't normally listen to, like foreign music from other countries or movie soundtracks, idk  Personally, if I am looking for new and obscure music to explore, I usually go on /mu/.  if you can dig through all the circlejerking bullshit then there are some sharethreads and stuff with a lot of good music that you probably haven't heard before.  I discovered many awesome genres of music on /mu/ that I had never even heard of before.

They will break you into new genres that you didn't know you could enjoy.  Next, use Pandora to discover new music. Save the songs you thumb up to Spotify, then grab more songs from that artist. Take your new favorite songs and look them up on Pandora, repeat. Some artists put a lot of pride into their albums, so you should listen through some albums start to finish for full effect. Save your favorites to playlists for certain moods you are in. When you get stuck back in a dead end of circular music tastes, go back to All Songs Considered or r/listentothis or r/listentomusic.  Also don't forget to revisit old artists. They will have new stuff that might take you into a new subgenre.

I'm also a hip hop/alternative fan and it's tough to find new music that isn't directly from the artist I'm already a huge fan of. If you've never tried hypemachine.com it's a refreshing break from pandora or spotify. There's tons of genres you can browse from and the mass majority of people that use it have a unique taste in music making the popular page not all that mainstream. If you have friends that use the website/app you can look at their favorites on ur feed which practically makes it twitter for music. My favorite part of the site is how many good remixes show up on it. A good way to start out is to search a couple of your favorite artist (Mainly Hip Hop) and discover a variety of remixes they may have.

IWantToLearn,3d70n8,talas43,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:41:09 2015 UTC,"My personal approach to finding new music is (primarily) to do a couple of things: 1. find up-and-coming artists with smaller, more personal fanbases 2. find free downloads for awesome, not-yet-discovered songs.  Of course, there's different ways of doing that, depending largely on your tastes in music. I looked through your last.fm account, and it looks like our tastes line up, so I'll offer you my advice (but just for your own reference, here's some of my favorite bands: Tokyo Police Club, Cage the Elephant, Grouplove, Weezer, Portugal. The Man, Walk The Moon, and I'm into some rappers like Chiddy Bang, Chance the Rapper, Hoodie Allen)  Some places to check out, pretty much regardless of your musical tastes:   Pandora and Spotify. Idk if you've tried them yet, but I've seriously found a lot of my music through them, I'd consider them pretty foundational when it comes to music discovery Noisetrade. Free DLs for great unknown artists (and even some already popular artists), many of whom are very much rising stars in music ""Every Noise at Once,"" http://everynoise.com - This site has lots of uses with regard to music (I've figured out how to define styles of music I never knew had names), but one thing its good for is music discovery. Just find your genre of choice. Get specific recommendations from people who like music you like. Friends are great, but also music communities (like the subs mentioned in /u/connor114's answer), and communities like https://www.reddit.com/r/ifyoulikeblank so you can get specific recommendations, and also follow your favorite artists (or other people with good music taste) on Twitter and other social media sites and see who THEY like. Also, speaking of your favorite artists, find out who they've toured with/are currently touring with and check those guys out. Chances are, you might like them too. iTunes free songs of the week! Last I checked, there don't seem to be any this week (which is a bit ominous...) but iTunes always has free songs of the week in the iTunes store, and lately there have been songs from like 10 different genres, so you're sure to find SOMEthing you like and then I just Google'd ""music discovery"" for inspiration for more recommendations, but then I realized that you can try that yourself and find some good places to find music.

The two apps I use to find new artists are 8tracks and pandora mainly. Sound cloud and Spotify are good too.  8tracks are play lists people put together. This is nice if you just want to put on a play list and not have to think about it. Try tags like: alternative; indie; rock; summer. You can also explore and mess around with other tags. I like to pick movies I liked. People on 8tracks make play lists in these themes. Inception, iron man, avengers, dexter, etc...  Pandora is great for finding new artist but can get redunadant. So make a lot of channels. Type in the artist you like or a specific song, it'll play songs that are similar.  I've  found a ton of new artists on there.  Biggest thing for finding new music is spending time to wade through music. And stay interested enough to keep exploring.  There's youtube channels, subreddits, and podcasts. Best of luck."

I like to say there are two kinds of people who collect a library of music. Those who have a ""radio"" of individual songs from artists, who tend to be less interested in the band/albums/general nitty gritties of music, and then there's folks like us who know those things and buy vinyls and listen to whole albums through and assemble complete libraries we know everything about. One isn't necessarily better than the other, it's just based on level of serious interest. What I've seen to be the very best way to discover new music, tried and true about as long as music has been around, is just to talk to people who like the same music you do. Go down to the record store with a band or genre or just a feeling in mind and tell the shop keep about it. Those guys know so much about music it's ridiculous, or at least they should. Don't worry about feeling over your head because this person knows so much, or maybe they'll think your taste in music sucks. Anyone who loves good music enough to make it their life just wants to help people find their niche, plus if they're a dick they probably sell boring music and you should go to a record store you like more.   If that doesn't work for you, and there isn't anyone around you who can show you interesting music, whether it's similar to what you already listen to or a fascinating world away, the alternative is to learn a little bit more about what you listen to and use that information to scour the internet. This can be a long process of clicking on YouTube videos and knowing what to search for, being things like side-projects of your favorite artists, other bands they played shows with inspirations they mention in interviews, other bands on the same label, or really any useful dirt you can find, but to me it is ultimately extremely rewarding to discover some really astonishing music, new or old, in some strange corner of the internet completely on my own."

Once I've gone through the album, I go back and listen to each remaining song all the way through and decide again. The songs left are then added to my other playlists.

For instance, I just googled ""Tame Impala inspiration,"" but you can also Google things like ""influenced by,"" etc, look at interviews of them in magazine articles, and write-ups of the band origins, etc.  Google has interviews by Tame Impala discussing the Bee Gees and Supertramp as influences.  Supertramp is a great band, listen to some of their top stuff (Take the Long Way Home, Breakfast in America, Logical Song, Goodbye Stranger).  Then of course, once you get into some of those bands, go backward from there to those bands' influences, etc.                      The other thing I'll tell you is don't necessarily expect to like something right away.  Your brain actually has to adjust to liking new music.  Some of my favorite songs, I've had to listen to a number of times before I actually appreciated them.  After you have listened to a lot of new music, you will start to appreciate new stuff more easily.  You'll still have your taste preferences, but listening to new stuff will be easier."

IWantToLearn,3d8fjn,lunchtimereddit,4,Tue Jul 14 09:04:17 2015 UTC,"It's normal that you are very good with faces. Everyone is better at recognizing faces than at remembering names. There are two reasons for it, the first one is that recognizing is a process of memory that is much easier than retrieval. I'll give you a practical example. Remember when you were studying for an exam and you reviewed the material you were going to be tested on? a lot of times during that review you would be sure that you know the material but when you got to the test you couldn't remember many things. What happens is that you become familiar with the text you are studying so you recognize the information there but once you don't have the text you can't retrieve the information you thought you knew. It's the most common learning  illusion.  The second reason is that we have a part of our brain specialized to process and recognize faces. It's a key process that we have evolved to be very good at. I'm not trying to say that everyone is as good as you recognizing faces, you might be better than most people, I don't know. What I do want to say is that it's normal to be better at faces than at names. Now, for memorizing names, there are memory techniques called mnemonics which you can look up and won't take you much time to understand.  Some tips to help you out in the meantime: When you present yourself and the other person gives you his/her name, pay attention and give some extra thought to the name. A lot of time we don't remember the name because we are not paying attention or we are too concerned about how we are coming across. Take the focus out of yourself for a moment and focus on the person in front of you. The other thing that will help is once you hear the name try to thing of someone you know with the same name and create an association between both of them. If you don't know anyone with the same name, take the sound of the name and find something that sounds similar, an object, an activity, anything will do. Then associate the name with the activity.  ie. If the last name of the person is Baker imagine him with a chef hat and baking bread.  There is actually a fun study involving names and professions. Search for Baker-baker paradox, It's a good read. Hope that helps. Cheers"

Lunchtimereddit: about two years, how about you Dave?  The repetition will help you remember"
IWantToLearn,3d8fjn,MrMysteryPenguin,2,Tue Jul 14 18:30:54 2015 UTC,"You're going to hate this answer, but write down their name to remember it. It works great for me, i'm basically the same as you. I almost never forget a face (unless I was super drunk). Others say, if you meet someone new make sure to use their name every time you speak with them, however I (for one) forgets the name right after i shake their hand. So I keep asking them, but I don't feel bad because I know I won't remember (unless I hang, or speak with them about a remember-able subject)."
IWantToLearn,3d8fjn,Kontrolgaming,2,Tue Jul 14 18:20:12 2015 UTC,"Heard of ""The baker/Baker paradox""? Two people, lets call them A and B, are told to remember a person. A is told that the persons last name is Baker. B is told that the person IS a baker. B is a lot more likely to remember the person, even though its that same word they have to remember about him. Why? A name is very abstract, and you dont have many things you associate with it. A profession on the otherhand does. When you are told someone is a baker, images starts popping into your head, associated with a baker; bread, flour, his White hat, cakes, perhaps even smells or a taste you remember. These all act like hooks for your memory, so when B has to recall this person, one or more of these hooks will help him to do so. A on the other hand, only has a name, and most names has few to none association. So the trick to remembering names, is to create strong images of it. Some names are easy, like John Smith. Picture the person with a hammer in his hand, standing infront of an anvil, pounding on a metal sculpture spelling out John. See the sweat dripping of his forehead, the smoke from the forge behind him. Picture what the smell might be in the room, of warm metal and smoke, and hear the Sound of fire and the hammering. Some names are harder, and you need to get more creative, and perhaps break it up into smaller words. Lets try with Carlos for a last name. I would picture the person sitting in a CAR, going bonkers, because he has LOSt his keys. I think you get the point. Search for the baker/baker paradox for a better explenation. The book ""how to developer a perfect memory..."" By Dominic O Brien covers the techniques as well if youre interested.

Tools are essential and without those you'll be spinning your wheels before you ever leave. For a true beginner I recommend looking into local maker spaces that might offer shop classes or at least some instruction.

Founding (2005) of article  History of YouTube:       YouTube was founded by Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim, who were all early employees of PayPal.  Prior to PayPal, Hurley studied design at Indiana University of Pennsylvania. Chen and Karim studied computer science together at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  YouTube's early headquarters were situated above a pizzeria and Japanese restaurant in San Mateo, California.   The domain name ""YouTube.com"" was activated on February 14, 2005, and the website was developed over the subsequent months. The creators offered the public a preview of the site in May 2005, six months before YouTube made its official debut. Like many technology startups, YouTube was started as an angel-funded enterprise from a makeshift office in a garage. In November 2005, venture firm Sequoia Capital invested an initial $3.5 million;  additionally, Roelof Botha, partner of the firm and former CEO of PayPal, joined the YouTube board of directors. In April 2006, Sequoia and Artis Capital Management put an additional $8 million into the company, which had experienced hugely popular growth within its first few months.   The first YouTube video was titled Me at the zoo, and shows co-founder Jawed Karim at the San Diego Zoo.  The video was uploaded on April 23, 2005, and can still be viewed on the site.

YouTube is everything from professionally shot feature films all the way down to ""i have a decent webcam""  Since the ""i have a decent webcam"" path was already answered I'm going to answer the higher quality.  First and foremost your phone is probably the best camera you have. I always recommend a gopro for the first upgrade. On the scale you are going to get to a gopro is practically a throwaway expense. Next grab a stabilizer, there are many options. For now that is your video rig.  Now audio, this is where you will spend your early money. Your mic is shit, your mic amp is shit, your mic recorder is shit, even the connection you use for your mic is shit. Spend some money buying an actual professional recorder, with external xlr plugged mic. Don't spend too much here yet, you should be able to get away with $500.  Now the software. Adobe is absolutely killing it right now. A subscription to the Adobe Creative Cloud is your best bet. Adobe CC is easily the best of the tools you will have and is actively used in major motion pictures. Incidentally this is also where you will quickly realize that your great computer,? Not so great.  As you develop as a content creators you will upgrade the piece you reach the limits of. Probably first will be adding to your audio equipment, getting a good mic from Rode will go a long way, a wind slip for the mic will be extremely important. Then you will reach the limit of the camera, Canon t3 is a fantastic choice for a next step, this will let you get into interchangeable lenses, something that will be extremely important.  After that it can get very expensive. At the furthest end we use cameras that cost $100k+ to buy, lenses that are $500k a set, Adobe CC is still used, computers quickly get into the $7k range and can be $50k, audio gets completely insane it is quite common for me to be holding a mic that cost $50k but now is priceless because it isn't made any more."

Generally speaking though, the lighter the color the lighter the taste. Its safe to assume that most packs with a white box or pack will be ""light"", the medium flavors will be darker and darker, all the way up to a black box which will generally mean they are the boldest flavor the company makes, e.g. American spirit black ""Perique tobacco"", which is aged in hickory whiskey barrels. One of my favorites, really rich and smoky taste. Just do a little research and experiment to find what flavor you enjoy.   When it comes to packing them down, its supposed to compact the tobacco in the cigarettes to give a smoother , more even burn. Takes a little practice to perfect the technique, but a good analogy is like hitting a ketchup bottle with your hand to get the ketchup to fall down to the opening.

From my experience though, not speaking for everybody, people generally have a preference, and don't much have a need for the flexibility. I used to get camel crushes if I planned on sharing a bunch of cigarettes, or just for the novelty of it.  Other forms cigarettes can come in include 100s or 72s. Those denote length (in millimeters). Sometimes people like a shorter cigarette, sometimes people like a longer one. There are also wider cigarettes, I think Marlboro has a shorter, but fatter kind available.  And then there are Capris, which you can find in smaller, sometimes taller boxes. Those are skinny sticks.  Disclaimer that this post is not advocating picking up smoking. Seriously. Just thought I'd write down some info I've picked up about cigarettes.

Not necessarily in terms of peer pressure, I just personally found I smoked way more cigarettes than I would have on my own in situations where I was outside with others and they would still have most of theirs left, so I'd light another one, or just out of boredom.

You're asking for bad advice.  Your poor phrasing would lead most to believe that you're pretty young.  Young people shouldn't smoke, your willpower is likely at its weakest, and you're going to need it to quit.  This is something you could easily ask at a tobacco shop or at a gas station.  Businesses want to sell you these things and get you hooked on them.  Don't waste people's time on the internet giving you advice when they'll surely recommend the best fit for your lungs.    Coming from someone who smoked for a long time, don't.  It's a useless habit, is incredibly unattractive once you quit, and although you might think it looks cool or rebellious now, one day you will see everyone sucking on burning paper as an idiot, as they deserve to be seen.

I don't care about what's attractive and what's not.   It's actually insulting for me to be stereotyped and roped in with the rest of young smokers. The truth of the matter is that I want to die. I'm not going to commit suicide, but this is the closest I want to get. I enjoy smoking, and if/when I die from smoking, I'll be relieved that I caused it.  I'm also excited to see what happens after death. Sure we could go by the standard scientific definition of death, but that's no fun.  TL;DR: I want to die, but don't worry about me. I'm fully aware of my actions and how they affect those around me."

Since you don't know how, you basically have one option.  Front the cash.    So you can front the cash for someone who KNOWS what they are doing and split the profits.  Or you can do it on your own.  Which will be harder and you'll end up splitting the profits with people who know what they are doing anyway (agents, contractors, etc.).  Either way is fine, but realize that in order to effectively flip a house, you have to either be very lucky and find an awesome deal (very hard).  Or you have to buy in a market that most others are locked out of and get the house into a condition where they are no longer locked out.  To put it more simply, your best odds are to buy hosues that can't be mortgaged, fix them to the point where they can be mortgaged and get out.  You're not building a hotel, you're fixing baseline problems.  So say a house had pipes explode.  No way you're getting a mortgage.  But you can pay cash.  Since most people need a mortgage, you have less competition = lower prices.    So you get the place for 40k under market value.  Awesome.  You spend 20k to get it fixed.  Then sell it for 50k more than you bought it for because now someone can get a mortgage and do the rest of the work.  Any money you spend renovating is a waste because you probably won't get back what you put in, unless you are renovating things to help it sell quickly.  All you should really be doing is fixing the issue, maybe repainting and putting down carpeting if its bad.  Maybe some other stuff under 1-2k, but no major work."

""scraping"" is when you buy a house on a half acre lot, tear it down and build three or four where that one used to be.   it is a real problem here because the street infrastructure is not being changed to keep up. so in neighborhoods that supported say, 300 families, now that same neighborhood has gone up by half or more. and this is happening all over my city.  so, i don't care for scrapers...but if you're thinking of getting into flipping, you might consider scraping as well."

IWantToLearn,3d3d9h,rustychrome,2,Mon Jul 13 19:58:11 2015 UTC,"My key bit of advice that I tell everyone is buying products for the house. You don't have to spend thousands on the kitchen and bathroom for it to look like a multi million dollar place. I always used business forclosure/liquidation actions to buy my bathroom furniture, tiles and so on. I'm not sure on the kitchen market in the USA. I notice on a lot of your flipping tv shows your kitchen look quite dated and similar. I have never bought one of their kitchens but IKEA have unique modern kitchens that I think will really set your property apart and wont break the bank. Get the appliances from the aforementioned liquidation sales.  I have started a property flipping blog which I've decided I will actually work on again now so if you want to check it out, send me a message (I know mods can be pretty strict on self promo).  EDIT: In regards to IKEA, the kitchens here in the UK are more expensive than the high end ones I buy for my properties here but it was just something unique I could think of. The point I was trying to make was to shop around. In all aspects -the house, the paint, the tiles, the contractors, the appliances. Make offers too. All they can say is no."

IWantToLearn,3d30ti,pingvellir,2,Mon Jul 13 03:03:15 2015 UTC,"Learning about meat and being a butcher are incredibly different. My parents run a factory and a few butcher shops so it's something I've been around a long time, and let me tell you, butchery isn't a trade that's easy to learn, or even limited to simply cutting and selling meat.   There are a vast variety of skills involved - everything from handling knives and machinery, to de-boning, slaughtering, preparing for retail sale, etc. requires extensive amounts of observing, practice and knowledge.   Then, selling the meat actually often demands that you know how each cut is best used so that you can make sure your customers get what they actually need. It's a lifelong trade - something that you commit to.   If it's just learning about the basic cuts of meat, rather than using the internet, you'd be better off going to your local butcher or meat specialist and asking your questions there (or better, ask them if you could borrow 15 minutes of their time for a cup of coffee - most butchers are quite busy most of the day). This is because the names of different cuts vary across countries/regions."

I have a cup from a chinese shop that has a removable metal filter so you can make the tea straight in the cup and then take the filter and leaves out. You can also use a cafetiere. Most of the time there are instructions from the tea supplier on the packet. You don't usually make oolong or green tea with boiling water (that makes it bitter), and the brewing times can be anything from 30 seconds to 4 minutes.

Soft water, as you can expect, has low concentrations of those same molecules.  In practice, hard water tends to leave damaging deposits on things like hot water heaters. Soft water, on the other hand, tends to not be so great at dissolving soap in the shower and can sometimes feel slimy on your lips when you drink it.  Salt water is basically what it sounds like.

Salt water has a lot of salt, like NaCl. I think the difference with hard water is simply the taste, because theoretically CaCO3 seems like a salt to me, but it doesn't taste salt, so people called it hard to distinguish it from the (soft) nonsalt water? Oceans have a lot of salt, too.   I have heard that oceans can be benificial for some skin conditions, but I don't know if that is true. My fish do benefit from a bit of salt in their water and you can threat some of their skin problems by letting them swim in salted water for fifteen minutes or so.

Might be a good starting point though for other people to add/comment on.   OBS / XSplit. Have tried OBS for fun, and it is very powerful especially considering it's absolutely free. Blue yeti and mics around its level are popular. 2 monitors should be both necessary for window management if you plan on reading chat etc. and also enough. Computer really just depends on what you plan on streaming. I know absolutely nothing on mixers and capture cards. You should also make sure your bandwidth is enough to handle streaming at an acceptable quality, otherwise no matter your equipment, the result will be lacking.   Hopefully most of these are reasonably right, but it would be good if others can confirm/correct them."

IWantToLearn,3czwr6,Twinge,2,Sun Jul 12 18:08:14 2015 UTC,Alright thanks so much! I'll be sure to ask you if I have any questions
IWantToLearn,3czwr6,WaffylesYay,11,Sun Jul 12 18:34:53 2015 UTC,"First: If you're just getting started, don't dump a bunch of money into it.  It's not especially worthwhile until you're confident it's worth your money to buy new equipment - you can probably stream on what you already have decently enough to get a good feel for it.  That said, in approximate order of importance:   A non-terrible microphone setup.  You can to avoid nasty peaking/popping that'll be unpleasant to listen to.  The standard recommendation here would be the AT2020; the Blue Yeti is popular (and is what I have), but I hesitate to recommend it because it is overly sensitive and really isn't the best fit for streaming.  Depending on what microphone you get you'll also need some additional hardware with it. Sufficient Internet and CPU to handle broadcasting at a decent bitrate.  For many games it's actually perfectly reasonable to stream at lower quality - I was partnered streaming at ~550kbps.  You're aiming for at least 3000kbps upload, and a good CPU - AMD 8350 or a comparable Intel i7 is about what you're looking at.  Baseline settings should be 2000kbps, 720p, 30fps. A 2nd Monitor.  This can also be a laptop, tablet, etc. to at least see chat on during full-screen games.  Not required but very helpful for managing streaming software, dashboard, donations, chat, etc. A Decent webcam.  Definitely optional - I've never used a webcam on stream myself.  For most streamers it will be a net gain and increase growth speed, but it depends on a lot of factors.   Other stuff:   OBS is the standard software option, and free.  Xsplit as some benefits that some people prefer. Any headphones will work, but you'll want a) something comfortable for extended sessions, and b) probably want something open enough you can hear your own voice somewhat; it's awkward to be talking constantly when you can't hear yourself.  (Some microphone setups can patch this in as well as another option.) Capture card - only necessary if you're going to be streaming from consoles or such; unnecessary when streaming from PC. Keyboard - some mechanical keyboards can be extremely loud which will be picked up on microphones excessively, so avoid them if possible."

You don't have to cook Alton Brown's recipes, he teaches you the tools and techniques to approach any recipe - from simple to complicated."
IWantToLearn,3czuci,firesoforion,2,Sun Jul 12 12:57:17 2015 UTC,"Like most things, with the correct tools and techniques you can become very proficient.  Without these, any hobby can be frustrating.  Painting with shitty paint and brushes is difficult even for professionals.  The same applies for cooking.  You simply need the tools and techniques, and some practice.  Below is way to get started as a beginner, since I know you don't want to go out and throw down $1000 dollars on equipment and lessons.  I feel it is a nice compromise though. For tools, I would suggest    at least one or two good (read: sharp) knifes (santoku knives are very popular and good for all-around jobs) a decent sized cutting board nice, big, non-stick pot, pan, and wok.   Most of my cooking is done exclusively with these few things.  Techniques would include    preparation techniques (e.g. proper, fast, and safe ways of cutting)  -- Youtube can be a source for instructions on how to cut things.  I would also do searches for ""safety tips with kitchen knives"". cooking techniques (how not to burn your food, etc.)  -- frying, baking, boiling, broiling, blanching, basting, and braising, just to name a few.  Maybe someone else can suggest a good resource.  I've just learning through trial-and-error over the years (i also had a roommate as a chef once).  A good rule of thumb is patience.  Turn down the heat and have patience. seasoning techniques (how to make it taste good) -- cookbooks are great here.  The key is to find a book that is not too over-the-top for a beginner.  I like this cookbook, because the recipes their are the very simple and quick.  After making a few, you'll find they mostly follow the same basic pattern for stir frying (Marinate, Meat, Veges, Seasoning, Serve.), and they contain the combinations of the same ingredients.  This works only if you go an asian grocery and grab most of the ingredients listed from the front of the book.  Once you have those ingredients you can improvise any type of stir fry you want using the same methods.   Skill comes with practice and learning what ingredients mix well and in what ratios.  Just go slow and simple with seasoning at first.  You can always add more but never take it out.  Below I've outlined the basic steps for a general stir fry.  Cutting will be slow and tedious at first, but will get much faster with good, sharp knives and proper cutting techniques.  After that, it is a very quick process.  I start the rice first thing, and always finish everything before the rice is done.  1) Get your carbs cooking since they may take a while        rice or noodles  2) Select your favorite protein. Cut it up and marinate it (see the cookbook).        pork, chicken, beef, seafood, tofu, etc.  3) Select your favorite vegetables and cut them up.        bell pepper, zucchini, broccoli, carrots, mushrooms, etc.  4) Select your favorite flavor enhancers.  Cut them up and fry them over oil for a short time.        garlic, onion, green onion, ginger, dried (fresh) chiles, can of thai paste  5) Add in your protein, and cook just enough so the meat is safe to eat.  Remove.  6) Fry up your vegetables.    7) Add in wet seasonings.        soy sauce, Worcestershire, sesame oil, cooking wine, hoison, teriyaki, honey, plum sauce, coconut milk  8) Add in dry seasonings        white/black pepper, salt, msg, cayenne, sugar, etc.  9) Add meat back in and stir."

IWantToLearn,3cypqc,MiguelForte,3,Sun Jul 12 05:56:39 2015 UTC,"I had a successful run in sales before going into teaching and was trained by some very good people. Here are two tips I can give you:   Every sellable feature of your product needs to fit into one of three categories: it must reduce hassle, be profitable or save time. How can feature X reduce hassle (""it's so much easier...""), make money (""it will pay for itself...""), or be more efficient (""this way you don't have to...""). I don't care if it's a car, a gym membership or a toaster. It's not the feature that matters, it's painting a picture for the potential buyer on how that feature can save them hassle, make them more profitable or save them time. The other thing I'd throw in there is that if it can be spun into making them safer (""and you can't out a price tag on safety..."") that can work in a pinch. Never let a potential customer go without at least asking them if they'd like to buy (""are you going to be taking home X today?""), and ideally ask them in a manner that assumes they will (""will you prefer three installments or six?"" Or ""Let me get the paperwork started for you...""). You'd be amazed how many sales opportunities are missed because the salesman talks and talks and goes round and round and never actually asks, ""Would you like to go home with one today?"" Don't use the phrase buying, if possible. That puts emphasis on the money they're spending. Instead, remind them of the immediate gratification (""enjoying all of the benefits of..."" Or ""driving it off the lot today...""). Put the onus on the customer to flat out say no.   Good luck."
IWantToLearn,3cypqc,ElGuapo50,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:26:43 2015 UTC,Here is the best advice I ever got in sales: Nobody wants to be made fun of at Thanksgiving.  Don't worry about the bullshit books and selling strategies.   Give them honest ways to shut down cousin dipshit when he runs his mouth at the holidays.  Provide them strong arguments that shut him down and proves that the client is smart for buying your thing.

Ask about them, their interests,  what they do, their favourite past time and football team.  This allows you to build a.personal connection with them, and thus makes it easier for them to buy from you because it's easy buy something from a trustworthy friend.  Find a common ground and strike up a comfortable conversation, that way even if you don't manage to sell anything and youre on commission for example, the pleasant experience itself will cushion the disappointment."

Americans have a habit of not breathing through their nose while speaking and that's the fist thing you want to tech yourself. Hum in a way that it vibrates the ridge of your nose then transition from that into making the word ""ok"" the o sound will roll from you hum well, but the sharp crisp k is what i've seen others struggle with.   After you've become comfortable with this new technique try speaking with it. The idea is that when you speak you should feel the bridge of your nose vibrate like when you were humming (this usually requires exhaling through your nose for certain words.

IWantToLearn,3cwlag,Ready-2-Fire,2,Sun Jul 12 11:52:20 2015 UTC,"I don't know of any articles, but this is how I learned:  Begin by closing your mouth and trying to make noises without vibrating your lips; you should eventually settle on a place that feels as though it's directly behind your nose. But in order to do this hum you'll notice yourself exhaling more than you would if you just did the traditional lip vibrations.   Once you have that down try and transition to saying the word ""okay"" you can breath out of your mouth for this, but remember that you should always feel that vibrating behind your nose (like when you were humming). OK is a good word to start on because the ""o"" sound will roll very easily from the hum, but the crisp ""k"" requires a bit of practice.   Once you've mastered the hum and the ""okay"" try other words and just experiment; basically talk to yourself in that voice until you can eventually do it without thinking.   Fair warning talking like that for an extended amount of time at first may make you loose that specific part of your voice, don't push it when that occurs just call it a day and start again tomorrow. This part of your vocal spectrum uses more of your skull's natural shape and bone structure to hone your voice taking higher pitched frequencies out leaving you with a voice that's so syrupy it belongs on pancakes."

Here are my observations so far, maybe you can tell me if I'm on the right track (and hope these are helpful for anyone else following along):  You get the nose/head vibration only when you hum at certain pitches. Start humming at the highest pitch you can, and lower your pitch step by step. Once you hit a certain point you'll relise the vibration has transitioned from your throat to your nose/head.  You'll also notice that as you try to increase the intensity of the vibrations, you end up expelling air more quickly/forcefully. Place a hand on your stomach as you do this and you can feel it deflate more dramatically.  It's almost counterintuitive - when I try to speak in a head voice like Daffy Duck, the vibrations stay constrained in the chest and don't reach the head. But for the vibrations to actually reach your head you need to draw power from your stomach."

IWantToLearn,3cw2yt,ghawesomepour,5,Sat Jul 11 06:53:08 2015 UTC,"The internet is full of resources, but there is a lot to be said about what constitutes the basics of music. The essential elements of music itself can be argued to be:   Pitch, the frequency of a tone as perceived. Melody, the perception of the sound of a succession of several notes. Harmony, the perception of the sound of several notes played at the same time. Rhythm, the structure behind when the tones (and percussion and other things for that matter) get played from bar to bar.   This is only the very essentials, of course, but from these, amazingly many concepts of music emerge. For example, when studying how different tone intervals sound (two tones being played either at the same time, harmonically, or in succession, melodically), you will get some knowledge about the mathematical theory about how instruments are tuned, and about the relationship between the frequencies of the two sounds being played.  Then, when wondering about why a piano and a violin sound very different, even when playing tones with the same pitch, you will start learning about timbre, which has its basis in what harmonic frequencies are also in the waveform produced by the instrument you hear. No real instruments produce pure notes, they produce a variety of different frequencies which get boiled down to one fundamental frequency by the ear and auditory system. The ear is amazingly well adapted to sorting out what different things sound like based on this.  I'd recommend just finding some good books or resources online, there is definitely no lack of it. I would also recommend getting hold of some music production software, something as simple as Audacity would do to begin with, so that you can experiment with different waveforms and what they sound like, and other interesting stuff like that. One fun thing to do there is to generate all the harmonic frequencies of a tone, but not the fundamental itself. The ear will hear that they are all frequencies of that fundamental, and interpret the sound as being in the pitch of the fundamental, even though that frequency is not actually present in the waveform!  So much amazing stuff to learn, and I don't even pretend to know a fraction of it all, but I could read about it and experiment with and play music for days on end, and if you are really interested, you will probably too!"

What's important is that the camera stay stable. A tripod will work, but the basic physics of it is that your sensor has to stay in the same space during the duration of the exposure. That's all that's important.  Keeping that sensor in the same spot can be achieved by a few means:   Use a tripod Use a cable release Use the mirror-lockup feature of your camera (if it has it)   Aside from that, ascertaining your exposure is best done with a lightmeter. If you're looking to do this on the cheap and you've never done this before, just mess around with exposure settings. Start at ISO100, f/11 and 15' (educated guess).

Keep in mind when doing this, you're going to get blurring as the stars move during the time the photo is being taken.  You can get better results by taking 10+ pictures at high ISO and shorter times, then using a stacking program that eliminates noise from the pictures only leaving the stars.

You could also search for a fabrication shop near you and talk to employees about how they got certified or if they even are. You may have to go out into nearby rural communities but there should be welders/welding schools somewhere nearby.

Welding stores offer classes, and if you're lucky, there was even a welding class in your HS.   If you want to learn welding, you're pretty much in the right place, since the auto industry is strong, and welding is one of those fields where you have to have the talent to make it work, so there's a strong drive to train as many people to find those gems.   And seriously take the classes. The access to equipment is absolutely mindblowingly cheap compared to trying to do it on your own.

Edit  I want to expand a bit because I've done this year's ago. It's good home reading to get the core concepts.  Learn all you can about MIG, TIG, and stick welding on both ferrous and non-ferrous metals. Learn how weld in 4 positions (horizontal, flat, vertical and overhead).  A good secondary learn is electricity.  Knowing electricity will help you understand why welding works like it does. It's pretty impressive to be able to send thousands volts through some metal and fuse the 2 together.   Get yourself a decent helmet with a 4x4 screen and try a couple different levels of tint. Play around with the tint in till you find one that is light enough to see what you are doing but dark enough to protect your eyes (if you are unsure always opt for darker)  Get. Leather welding jacket and some good leather welding gloves and for God's sake don't pick up hot metal with them. You will ruin them faster than you can spend a paycheque.  Once you get the basics down you can learn how to read blue prints and shop drawings....this will be immensely useful in the 1st and 2nd year of your career. Once you understand the drawings and know how to fuse metal together, there's nothing stopping you from being able to build just about anything.  Best of luck!"

Honestly, the first thing you're going to want to do is set yourself up with a good Intro to Philosophy book. Almost any book will do, even if it's written for kids. As the years pass philosophers become increasingly specialized and it gets very difficult to follow what they're saying without a broad knowledge base to build off of.  After that, a really great place to start is the basics of Western thinking. Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. I think Aristotle is the most accessible of the three, and he wrote on a wide variety of topics, from drama to science (although he was limited by the Ancient Greek understanding of the universe). You might start with his Rhetoric. I would recommend accompanying that with other books about formal logic and argumentation. I like Being Logical and The Art of Deception  You must understand rationality and logic to make any headway in philosophy. After you have a grasp of these, you can move on to any area of philosophy that piques your interest. I have an English degree, so my familiarity with philosophers is largely confined to those who had a significant imapct on the interpretation of literature; Freud, Jung, Marx, Derrida, Propp, Lacan, and Foucault, to name a few.  It all depends on what you're interested in. Philosophy tries to answer the Big Questions. Is there a reason we exist? Is there a god? What is the best way to live? What is the best way to govern people, if any? What is culture? Is there a universal ""human nature""?  Depending on which questions intrigue you the most, you will want to read the works of totally different philosophers. And never be afraid to look for explanations and commentary if you don't understand something. Philosophy, despite the shit it gets from STEM fundamentalists, is hard work."

Sure you'll learn MATLAB/STATA but being able to engineer in something like R or Python will set you up for a wide range of opportunity if combined with Economics/Statistics.  I'm speaking from a background in Economics/Pol. Sci.  Learning how to build/engineer helps reinforce problem solving, divergent thinking, and keeps you looking at different ways to approach a solution.  It also sets you up for a non-tech job market that's always hungry for grads who can program.  Modern Political Theory was my favorite poli sci class, but that was because my professor was amazing.  She questioned EVERYONE.  Zero-bias.  I'd argue that more important than the classes you take are the professors.  Cue ratemyprofessor.com.  Social science courses are great.  My Institutional Econ prof. had us start listening to EconTalk, and assigned us to watch Milton Friendman videos and other podcasts for homework.  I took that class 2 years ago and now I listen to Econ/Data Science-related podcasts as often as I can.  Ethics had me addressing philosophical conundrums common in business and science.  All Logic taught me was proofing - in a different language.  It was the easiest A ever, and basically reminded me that a cat is  and animal but an animal is not always a cat.  You can learn this in math, which is the philosophy's most universal language, and is applicable in programming.  If you're taking Economics, this kinda stuff might be elementary for you.  If you refuse to take a CS course - the classes that enhance your thinking abilities are the ones that force you to think critically.  Start with your Econ electives.  Then choose an area that interests you.  Agriculture?  Biology?  Psychology?  Chemistry?  You'll find that taking something that interests you will be easier to learn.  You'll have two strong intellectual hubs, and you'll find that as you go back and forth between your interest and Econ, you can make connections between the two, reinforcing lateral thinking and seeing from different perspectives.

In order to improve you need to be able to evaluate your failures and then apply that knowledge to future attempts.  TL;DR: Learning is about failing, evaluating failure, and then reiterating.

IWantToLearn,3cnxmg,counttess,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:59:09 2015 UTC,"I guess the wasted potential. If those few things put someone in the top, say, 3% of Excel users, that means so many people use the program but don't know how to unlock any of its potential. That means they find a lot of tasks more difficult and frustrating (or at least time-consuming) than they should be. That means people spend more time working on something than they need to.  That means humanity is overall less productive than it could be. It means people spend time struggling with Excel sheets when they could be done already, enjoying life. What's not depressing about people being stuck with an arduous task instead of enjoying life?  I mean, I have concrete examples. I recently turned a co-worker's task into a two-click process that completes in about 10 seconds. He said it used to take him at least an hour and a half. He did this task once a week. On that day, if he had a lot of other things to do, he'd often have to stay at work an hour late or so.  Now he doesn't. If the task stays relevant for the next five years, I just gave him around 250 hours of his life back. His actual life, out of the office. But that's because I was around to automate the process.  If the number of really capable Excel people is so low, most people would be stuck with tasks like that forever. How many collective hours of enjoyable life flow down the drain because of a lack of Excel skills? Too many. That's depressing."

IWantToLearn,3cqllw,NowHowCow,3,Thu Jul 9 23:59:16 2015 UTC,"First thing (besides learning to cast) would be finding out what species live in your lake, if you see locals fishing stroll over ask them if they've had any luck first then ask about what they fish for and what they have caught at that location ( don't ask for their good spots, no stranger will give up a honey hole easily) and ask them what they used to catch it with.  If you can't find anyone you can always try fishing with a hook and a worm, I can't think of a freshwater fish you can't catch on a worm . It's really easy to rig a basic worm setup. First tie the hook on the line with a fisherman's knot ( might have a different name but that's what I learned it as) it's really easy when you get the hang of it I'm sure there YouTube videos on how to tie it. Take a split shot weight and squeeze it on the line about 6 inches to a foot above the hook  Take a worm and slide it on to the hook wrap it around and hook it again until you've hidden a good part of the hook with the worm.  Now cast it out let it sink (if it's a saggy bottom don't let it sink all the way, if it's a clean bottom you don't have to worry ) and then reel it in slowly, pausing briefly from time to time, when you get a good strike set the hook by gently jerry the rod back and reel it in.   That's the basics, you can follow the rabbit hole down as deep as your heart desires from there as there is an abundance of gear, techniques, guides and species to chase, good luck and tight lines."

IWantToLearn,3cqtaf,Cayster108,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:02:21 2015 UTC,"Starting with the obvious, your arms need to be strong enough to at least hang from a branch for a good while.  Any improvements to your body that you make will help (pullups, pushups, dips, stretching, grip strength, leg strength, getting calloused hands, toughening yourself so you don't mind the discomfort of rough bark digging into your skin etc). That being said, your goal is to rely on that strength as little as possible.  Leverage and legs, my friend, are your tools (also strength and friction and probably lots of other things that don't both start with L).   If there is no branch to grasp, I can think of two methods.  Method numero uno:  you hug the trunk and use your legs to squeeze the trunk like a thigh master and inch your way up. By curving your spine and moving your legs higher and then straightening your spine and reaching higher with your arms, you can inch up the trunk like an inch worm or a caterpillar.  Note that you may want to wear clothing to cover your arms and legs.   Method two: Grab the trunk as if you were shaking someone's shoulders. Put a foot up on the tree and use your arms as a pendulum (not actually swinging) to direct the your body's force into the tree trunk through your feet.  Honestly I don't know why you asked this on reddit when there's surely a lot on the web about it already...   You should really just get good at climbing.  I've been a ""climber"" all my life and this stuff is intuitive/just another progression for me. So practice climbing trees WITH branches, practice climbing trees without branches that are angled so it's easier for you, practice climbing metal poles with bare feet.  Try to be more animal, do parkour type stuff, roll around in the grass. idk lol maybe you're just some lame person whose only goal is to climb straight trees. You just want some obscure technique that will make it a piece of cake.  Or you could be awesome and use this as an opportunity to get in touch with your animalness and develop your body. Parkour bruh (or brah). Why am I ranting. Honestly I'm practicing my typing and it's just flowin right now.  Watch some videos of monkeys.  Just climb everything. Do pullups and such like.

Once you start making money, save and make a budget. Make a game out of how little you can live off of each week, and try to beat it each following week. Open a bank account and automatically deduct X amount of $ each paycheck into your savings. Set this up to happen automatically. When you make your budget, make sure you record what you spend and compare that to what you thought you'd spend. Make adjustments where necessary. Use mint.com for this. Its free and awesome.  Establish Credit. Get a credit card (preferably one with rewards attached), and put everything you can on it, and pay the entire balance in its entirety each and every month. This shows creditors you are responsible with debt and can manage money. Do NOT get store cards (GAP, Old Navy, Express, Etc.), as these will actually hurt your credit score.  Once you have a job and established credit, buy a car. Take a loan out (that you can afford), and make your payments on time.   Get your own phone plan- this one is easy.... just get your own phone plan. Not much else to say.  Learn to cook, learn to whatever.... Nike said it best, Just do it.

They're relatively simple concepts and there's plenty of research material for them seen as they're over half a century old. They were originally used as guidelines for traditional cartoon animation but they can be transferred to all types of animation in one form or another. Two of Disney's original animators, Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, wrote a book called 'The Illusion of Life' that explains these concepts in great detail if you really want to get balls deep in animation theory, but I think once you know the basic principles the best thing to do is just to try and put them to good use.    Edit: Decided to add more info specifically for stop motion. For starting off with stop motion I would use whatever camera you have available to practice. If you have access to a DSLR with a tripod that is ideal as the camera must remain completely still (I have a remote shutter as well so I don't even need to touch the camera). To make sure you're getting your shots and timings right it's best to do a rough storyboard before you start shooting. Also, timing the actions of your characters is incredibly useful. If you know the frame rate of your animation and the length of time it should take to complete an action you can figure out how many frames you need to shoot, this stops your animation from being too quick and jerky or too slow and 'wishy-washy'.    I hope this info has helped you out! If you have any other questions let me know :)"

Then put a pattern to it. This is where some variation comes into play. For example in guitar. There's different ways to go through chords. How you strum each chord or how you finger pluck just the sound you need. Tons of variation there too.  Then there's the lyrics. This realm is all on you. Anything under the sun. It could be about someone you like, the polar bears, or a flying microwave killing the planet with gamma radiation. It doesnt matter at all. It's what you choose the song to be.  Do this process many times and you will eventually develop an ear for what's good and what's bad. You can't possibly know something is bad if it's your first couple of songs. You need an audience to listen to. Ask what other people think about your songs and learn from there.  You're right. Everything in music is subjective. That's what makes it equally wonderful and horrifying at the same time. This is a skill. And like any skill you need to do this time and time again until you feel like you've done enough.

Do you worry about your neighbors breakfast choices?   If you're concerned about her cheating, and genuinely think you can influence that outcome, then act in a way that will influence that outcome to your liking. Will asking repeatedly do that for you? Most likely not, possibly the opposite. Correct that, and act accordingly.   Maybe subtle romantic gestures are what you should turn to, or maybe self improvement and a bit of macho-ing up, since it could definitely be a fear of that kind of person sweeping your girl away. If you're afraid of a better man, or a ""real man"", stealing your girl, either grab your gun and dedicate your life to hunting out and eliminating these men, or become that better man yourself. The latter seems more fruitful.   And lastly, understand that these instincts are working against your best interest. Who's life is this, yours, or your instincts? Then ask yourself which is being more catered to. Fix that."

IWantToLearn,3cilax,DaisyLayz,27,Wed Jul 8 18:56:20 2015 UTC,"I understand that anxiety and the accompanying mistrust and paranoia can be very upsetting. They can genuinely ruin your day until you find out the truth that all along you were worrying for no reason. If your gf has displayed nothing but trustworthiness, then you should accept the fact that she hasn't broken it thus far, it would only make sense for that trend to continue. Whenever I feel like this, I think that I tend to assume the worst. For example, ""she didn't call me when she was leaving work and usually does by now. Its 9:24, she's supposed to be off by 9... what if she's hooking up with the manager!? What if she's hurt!?"" And then 5 minutes later I would get the call that she had to stay a little late cuz it was busy, and it was the truth. I spent nearly a half hour getting worked up and upset at her for literally no reason. I think you should explain to your gf that (assuming she is a trustworthy person), you are sorry for accusing her of things and you're simply coming from a place of concern and care. Acknowledge that you are wrong and have been wrong and maybe consider this: when I felt most anxious or whatever around my gf, it was during a time in my life that I, myself, was quite insecure. Maybe addressing your own insecurity can help alleviate this. At the end of the day, communication is key; make sure you guys are always on the same wavelength. You need to understand the logic that she deserves your trust. She also should try to understand that you don't purposefully feel like this and that you wish you could stop it, but you can't change how you feel. Maybe she can work with you. It will start to annoy her, though, being questioned and accused for no reason. Put yourself in her shoes snd hopefully she can do the same for you.  You'll be fine, just trust her and trust the fact that you can only control so much. Anything you can't control (like what she MAY be doing) is hard to accept, but wrongfully worrying about it is not worth it. Best of luck to you, man."

Something made her choose you and that's something to hold onto. If you're worried, talk to her CALMLY about those worries. Getting upset with her will just make her upset, and give her a reason to believe that maybe you aren't treating her properly and to seek proper treatment elsewhere. But if you put yourself on her level, and speak to her about anything that may worry you in a mature way, she's going to respect that. Respect her, allow her to live her life as she sees fit and if anything that either of you may do bothers either of you, sit down and have a calm conversation about it and work it out. Always remember the good stuff and the reasons you chose each other in the first place. Never let blind rage or any issues get in the way of that.

Western Europe is pretty safe, but expensive. Look at work gigs there like helpex and workaway. Alternatively if you want to stay longer try being an au pair. I've been through Central America as well, which was a little shady but totally worth the risk in my opinion. Avoid the big cities, villages and islands are much safer. Morocco and Egypt brought a lot of male attention.   Making friends while traveling is pretty easy. Stay in hostels and back packer places, say hello to everyone then ask a couple of questions, (where are you from, what trip are you on). 9/10 they'll respond well. Then invite them to have food/go to the beach with you."
IWantToLearn,3cifs1,Blossomkill,5,Wed Jul 8 06:48:10 2015 UTC,"In addition to u/blossomkill advice, if you've not travelled solo before, start somewhere where it's not unusual to see women on their own, like London, Sydney, or another major metropolitan city. Hawaii would be a fun start to help you get used to being alone, making new friends, and getting some attention that may be unwanted. If you live near a big city, take short trips to the city and be a tourist. Avoid situations that would put you in danger (drinking too much, accepting drinks from strangers in the really big cities, not knowing how to get back to your hostel, etc). To reiterate the advice above, villages and smaller towns are more friendly and helpful toward women travelers than the large cities. But you have to know how to handle yourself in either situation.   I will say the one place where I'd absolutely love to travel solo, but was also grateful to have my (male) SO with me, was Bali. The locals are incredibly friendly and generous - strong belief in karma, which you should repay in kind in terms of behavior. Absolutely love Bali. BUT the male tourists from neighboring islands - mostly Java and mostly Muslim, I found out - were awful and really intrusive. I'd be sitting on the beach while my SO surfed and dozens of them would ask to take photographs of me, talk about my bikini, try to put their arm around me, say ""I give you money, you be my girlfriend in photo,"" and then sneak away to take pictures of me anyway when I said ""NO."" They were pretty relentless and annoying until my SO came out of the water and shoo'd them away. One example of unwanted attention, but could probably be easily avoided by beaching with newfound friends.  The last thing I'll add is to make sure you dress appropriately to whichever country you visit. It will help you feel more comfortable and will also avoid some of the unwanted attention. Most places are Westernized in terms of clothing, but there are varying levels of shoulder and knee coverage. Local outfits that can be bought cheaply double as souvenirs and are probably better suited to the climate. I've seen women be harassed, by officials at different venues (churches, museums, temples, the post office) or just men on the street, for wearing spaghetti strap tanks and shorts. At the least, a loose maxi skirt and a loose shirt that covers shoulders is a pretty universal outfit for any location.   Good luck on your travels and have a wonderful time!"
IWantToLearn,3cifs1,wordswerdswurdz,2,Wed Jul 8 14:39:30 2015 UTC,I'd definitely second dressing like a nun when visiting Muslim countries. It makes life much easier. Dressing fairly modestly everywhere helps limit male attention.

This obviously won't prevent some of the threats you'll face as a woman, but it will make it much easier for them to find and help you if something happens (if you end up in a hospital for example). The embassy for the country you are in may also send out alerts on local threats/crimes/scams/etc which can be very helpful. Also, make sure you carry the phone number of the local embassy. A few years ago local Honduran police were trying to extort money from me. When they got their guns out I pretended to call the US embassy in Tegucigalpa (my phone was dead).

Once you get your bearings, which should be around Mérida, hit up Chiapas and Oaxaca. Both states have a lot to offer, and still have enough backpackers to never feel lonely.

IWantToLearn,3ch39v,lc929,2,Tue Jul 7 21:24:37 2015 UTC,"I think the best thing for you would be to pick up a beginner's book for set theory. Most of the symbols in the picture would more likely be discussed there than anywhere else (although the actual content of the picture seems to be computer sciences, I'm not sure though)  For the purposes of this picture though, the weird e with a strike through on line 3 means 'not an element of', or 'not in'. So your alphabet (sigma) does not contain the gap symbol '-'.  Let h: X --> Y is read 'let h be a function from X to Y'. That is, h takes things in X and assigns to them things in Y. The cup shape is a union, which is when you take two things and put them together into one thing. Here the union takes the alphabet sigma together with the gap symbol.   I'm not sure what the * means in this case as it can mean different things depending on context. I'm betting it's probably a standard notation in that field. If this is a field you're trying to get into, I would recommend looking for books that revolve around that field, rather than just math books in general."

As a start you have to distinguish two parts, (arbitrary) naming of objects with greek letters (in this case the upper-case sigma for the alphabet, x and y for the sequences, '-' for gap, etc.) and mathematical symbols that have a specific meaning (not element, =, function definition, union, etc.).  For the first part you just have to go along, specific letters are often reused for the same or similar purposes, but in principle there is no rule. For the second part you just have to learn the meaning of the symbols, just looking at their definition in the list ayecee linked is probably a good start.

But you still have to learn it. For example, {x: x∈ℝ} means the variable x is an element of the set of all real numbers. The notation communicates that a lot faster and more efficiently than the English words do.   Everyone learns a little in school, but they only learn what they need to learn. I did Extension 2 Maths in school (the highest level possible in Australia), and am studying engineering in University, and I don't even understand some of the stuff written in that picture. That might be because the maths that I needed to learn doesn't apply to what's in that picture.   However, like any language, you can learn.   If you do, you might find this useful. However, using that would be akin to finding a Japanese phrase, and using google translate to convert it to English. If you really want to understand what is being said, you need to dedicate time, to properly learning the maths. Buying a book on discrete maths, would help, but I think that you would need to be properly taught the maths, probably at a university. And different topics in mathematics use different notation. For example, if you were to buy a book on linear algebra, you wouldn't learn anything about Calculus, and thus calculus notation. Again, learning maths is just like learning a language."

IWantToLearn,3cemqy,realigion,27,Tue Jul 7 14:05:04 2015 UTC,"Check out the book Impro by Keith Johnstone. It's a very short, very entertaining read on how to teach improvisational theatre, but contains really fantastic wisdom on conversation in general. I'm not the best at putting it to practice, but it's helpful nonetheless.  In particular, there are two paradigms that I found interesting. First, status. Everything you do carries a connotation of status. This isn't socioeconomic status (although it's correlated) but just conversational status. You can elevate your status, lower your status, elevate their status, or lower their status.   Example:  ""Do you read often?""  ""I do (elevating self)! I'm currently reading Newton's Prinicipia Mathematica (elevating self), but I really can't understand it as much as I ought to be able to (lowering self).""  ""I imagine that's a difficult read, but just taking it on is impressive (elevating other). It took me two reads of Wealth and Power of Nations to really understand it (elevating self).""  The key to this is twofold. First, conversations suck when there are huge status grabs or status losses. These are the result of either deprecation or bragging — neither is desirable. Second, a truly good conversationalist is one who can alternate effortlessly between all four modes of operating. Think of the best teacher you've ever had: authoritative to the point you trust their lessons, but empathetic enough not to feel overwhelmed. They accomplish this by alternating status. ""The principle is simple (high status), but the calculations can sometimes get messy (low status).""  The second cool paradigm is ""blocking and accepting."" This is much easier to strictly practice, although it'll be awkward at first. To block is to reject a topic. It sounds rude, but it creates much more dynamic conversations. Accepting is running with a topic. It can be good, but people tend to accept too much, which corners the conversation.   ""...and then Robert ran over and he just changed all the plans that I had just made for the night!""  Blocking: ""Okay, I think you're just complaining because you don't have your way!""  Accepting: ""What are your plans now?""  The blocked conversation will instantly go into ""I'm not a control freak"" (interesting stuff!) whereas the accepted one will go into ""dinner then bar then club"" (not interesting stuff!).  You can play it as a one-sided game. Decide you'll accept 2 and then block 1. You might have some awkward transitions, but you'll learn a lot about the dynamics of conversation.

People love talking about themselves, so give them the opportunity.  I've had discussions with people where I've done nothing but ask them questions about themselves, and never had any questions thrown back at me.  At the end of the conversation the other person thought I was a great person, but to be honest, really didn't know anything about me since the entire conservation was centred around them.

A very easy way is to say ""you know, that reminds me of..."" and tell a story or a fact, doesn't have to be entirely related, as long as it's interesting no one will notice your conversational judo.  Finally, something else that can help a lot is to give longer answers to questions you are asked to open up the conversation. If the girl asks you what you like doing, don't just say the activity, mention why you like it, why you got into it or how it makes you feel (this applies to any question you are asked).

Keep looking up the answers in the back of the book or wherever you do them, and your repertoire of approaches will increase.  You'll start to see similarities among problems and develop an intuition for doing them.  It's also worth mentioning that websites like Lumosity claim to have games that are most effective at training your brain, but there is little evidence to support those claims, so it's questionable.

One of my favorite logic tips that I try to teach my kids: try to identify when a condition will not or cannot happen.  Once something is ruled out then it simplifies your range of solutions.  Keep repeating this and your possible solutions will be narrowed down drastically.  This principle applies to many many logic puzzles."

IWantToLearn,3cebjv,TempAccount565,6,Tue Jul 7 06:24:02 2015 UTC,"Creativity is a side effect of the implementation and practice of skills.  You want to be creative at filming, editing and recording, so that's where the effort of gaining skills need to be. I have a little experience in that myself, I have worked on a community tv show, I have made company demo videos, and I have a decent youtube following. Forget about equipment, that is not what makes you good. I have 2 video cameras, one that cost $2000, one that cost $40. I use the $40 95% of the time. Personally I think the best way of rapidly learning new skills is to copy, copy and copy.   Find movies, youtube videos, or tv shows  that you like and want to emulate. Break down what it is about them that you like. Start to think about how it was made, how the camera changes the feel, how the cuts and edits were made, and how the script may have been written describing what you see on the screen.  Try to emulate the parts you like, eventually when your skills get better, you'll realise what you like and what you don't, and your work will become more yours and less copied from others.  Famous works like Star Wars, and any Tarantino film are most notable for having huge amounts of scenes copied from others. Everything is a remix. So build on the existing world, don't be scared to copy, and when the time comes, add your brick to the wall of creativity. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9ryPC8bxqE"

I can't give you a standarized answer that will work for everything, but I can give you a few tips that can help you start your journey against creative sterility.   Find your spark. Something that makes you really want to push forward, to do the same things you're seeing. If you want to get into filming and editing, open Youtube and find channels that will inspire you. I tell people that what gave me the final push to switch from studying translation to studying art were Freddie Wong's videos. Research. Look up what tools will you need, and how to work with them. Look up how others started, and tutorials on how to do both general things and specific things (with flexibility on both, of course). For you, it may be interesting to research about the way cinema started, how things have developed over time, how to use the tools you have to get the best possible results, etc. Practice. Practice, practice, practice. Start out small, make tests and simple stuff even if they feel boring. With time you can move on to more complex, yet more interesting stuff. Become familiar with failure. As Dave Grohl says, just go out there and suck. Learning how to do something can become overwhelming when you see the quality of other people's work, specially when you're just starting. I used to get disheartened when I saw people making amazing cosplays and I was making crap costumes, but if you keep at it you can eventually make great things of your own (and please ignore those who say ""my first time doing X"", most of the time it's bullshit). If you're having trouble coming up with ideas, you probably need to expose yourself to more influences (God, I rewrote this line five times and I can't make it sound bad). I suggest both Reddit and TVTropes, reviled as it may be. The first is an amazing fountain of knowledge (and ways to access it, just browse the right subreddits), while the second one is a huge catalogue of storytelling devices and has a good way of connecting them through already existing works. Finally, find people with the same interest as you do. Interacting with friends or a community can help you learn more, can open doors that would otherwise be closed and can may be able to get you help if you ever need it.   I hope this was of help somehow. Good luck!"

Sitting down and not having things to talk about is the absolute worst to listen to.   Try to have a theme to the cast. There are very few people that I can simply listen to talk about anything.

It's definitely no replacement for a job, but much of it is either passive or something you can do while watching tv, playing games or redditing at work. Some of them having gaming credits as payout options.  Swagbucks (Referral / non-referral) is a site that pays you to engage with advertising, sign-up for offers, watch videos, play games and fill out surveys. If you're savvy you can make 100+ bucks fairly quickly by signing up for free trials and making sure you cancel them before the trial period is over. There's plenty of smaller offers if you're not into giving out cc information. You can make $1.18 total a day mostly on auto pilot with their 6 mobile apps: Swagbucks TV Mobile, EntertaiNOW TV Mobile, Lifestylz.tv(android only) MovieCli.ps(android only), Sportly.tv(android only) and Indymusic.tv(android only). You just favorite a short video in each app and let it loop until it reaches the daily point limit. (find shortest videos here:)They pay out via Paypal, Amazon gift cards or many other gift cards. Message me if you need any help setting up the apps!  Yroo (Referral / non-referral) is a social shopping community that let's you shop, share, and save from dozens of popular brands. They offer cash back on all purchases as well as rewards for using the site and sharing your finds with followers and friends. If you don't want to make purchases you can still easily earn by sharing your referral link. They pay out to Paypal.  Bing Rewards (Referral / non-referral) Pays you to use Bing search. You get 1 point per 2 searches up to a maximum of 15 points a day. You can also get an additional 10 points a day for mobile searches. You're allowed 5 accounts per ""household"" (IP address), but each account technically needs to belong to a different person. If you use believable names and email addresses you can be 5 people! Just don't redeem for a reward on more than 1 account per day. If you've keeping track that's 125 points (roughly worth $1.25) a day. Does that sound like a lot of searching? Well there are numerous ways of automating the searches. Try using Bing-pong or anything else you can find with a quick internet search. They pay out via Amazon gift card or many other gift cards.   Qmee (Referral / non-referral) is one that I love for its simplicity. It won't earn as much as the other sites/apps in this list, but it requires very little effort. Qmee installs a browser add-on that displays related advertisements on the left side of your screen after searching particular phrases in Google, Bing, Amazon and Ebay. By clicking any of the advertisements you instantly earn 5-15 cents. You can cash out to (verified) Paypal at any amount and they usually get it to you within the hour (very rare in this scene). They are pretty good at not letting you game the system, but try searching for consumer products like ""socks"", ""printer ink"", ""baby clothes"", etc. Note that if you are big on privacy this add-on probably isn't for you. They clearly have access to what you're searching and clicking. As an alternative you can install in a browser that you don't use for normal day to day browsing and be perfectly fine.  Topcashback (Referral / non-referral) is a very simple site that earns you a percentage cash back when you shop popular online retailers through their site. Yes you do need to make purchases to earn, but if you do what I do and only buy things that you would have anyway, it's free money. They're partnered with thousands of retailers including popular ones like Amazon, Best Buy, Old Navy and Target. In addition to cash back, you can also find coupon codes which will give you instant savings. I buy my dog's food from petsmart.com. When I visit Petsmart via Topcashback I get 7% cash back. 7% of my mastiff's food bill is a nice chunk of change! Cashback sites are notoriously picky with giving credit for a qualifying purchase, so make sure that you follow their guidelines. That includes not using ad-blockers, cookie blockers or navigating away from the retailers website after clicking through from Topcashback.  Mobile Performance Meter (Google play store) is an Android app that runs in the background of your phone and tests cell reception in your area. It only pays 20-40 cents a day based on your area and does not work at all in some areas. But once you install it, you never have to do anything but redeem once you get enough points. Every month or so you'll get an easy survey that pays $1.50. There's no Paypal payment option, but they do have lots of available gift cards.   General tips:    Create a new email address and use it to sign up for any of the above. Some sites are better than others, but you'll likely get a fair amount of junk mail doing this.  Don't use ad-blockers in the browser you use for the sites above. Some sites won't work and others may ban your account. Same thing with VPN/VPS. Some of this is US only. It's up to you to see what works in your country. Having a spare smart phone or two can makes things a lot easier on you. You typically only need wireless internet access and not a phone plan. Checkout c7recycle for cheap phones.  Cash out early and often. Some of these sites are ban happy and their point values are always subject to change.    Good luck and don't be afraid to message me with any questions!  https://yroo.com/page/social?ga_ref=social_invite_m&ga_ruid=274139"

Outline Format is my favorite, but whatever you like.  Schedule your review sessions. Do this in another book, and write all your work down so you can see your thought process. Even if you get something wrong seeing your thought process is very useful.  Every week/month/season/year I'll answer 10 questions for each Sub-Topic/Topic/Chapter/Part I have read  Then review all the questions you got wrong.   Finally when you finish your book review 10 questions from everything again. Review everything you got wrong.

IWantToLearn,3c7mpp,LordScoffington,2,Mon Jul 6 00:50:28 2015 UTC,"Read and take notes. At the end of each section/chapter close the book and notes and try to summarize what you just read.  Sometimes it can be easy to not really think when you read or even take notes, think about what you are reading and what information it is trying to give.   Take breaks. Figure out a schedule that works for you such as: 50 min study/10 min break. Go for a walk, take a nap or do something 'mindless'. This will help your brain process the information.    Make flash cards from your notes as needed. Review them often.   Make tests based on the chapter/sections and review the test questions, similar to flash cards.  Constantly reviewing help put the information into long term memory.    My favorite book on the topic is A Mind for Numbers and there is a Coursa course based on it called Learning How to Learn.

The term ""mindfulness"" is derived from the Pali-term sati,  ""mindfulness"", which is an essential element of Buddhist practice, including vipassana, satipaṭṭhāna and anapanasati. It has been popularized in the West by Jon Kabat-Zinn with his mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program.  Mindfulness is also an attribute of consciousness long believed to promote well-being.  Large population-based surveys have indicated that the construct of mindfulness is strongly correlated with well-being and perceived health.   Studies have also shown that rumination and worry contribute to mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety,   and mindfulness-based interventions are effective in the reduction of both rumination and worry.    Clinical psychology and psychiatry since the 1970s have developed a number of therapeutic applications based on mindfulness for helping people who are experiencing a variety of psychological conditions.  Mindfulness practice is being employed in psychology to alleviate a variety of mental and physical conditions, such as bringing about reductions in depression symptoms,    reducing stress,    anxiety,    and in the treatment of drug addiction.    It has gained worldwide popularity as a distinctive method to handle emotions.  Clinical studies have documented the physical and mental health benefits of mindfulness in general, and MBSR in particular.   Programs based on MBSR and similar models have been widely adapted in schools, prisons, hospitals, veterans centers, and other environments.

Even with the feminine expression, you could post to /r/transpassing and ask how/ if you could ever pass (and also look at how some members there know that they're not passing well, but they're being true to themselves and being as femme/ masc as they can be). In terms of acting femme, that can be a learned trait for anybody.  As for your other post - just grow your hair a bit. Fuck it. You are going to have to deal with confrontation later on in your life - being forced to have short hair is something worth fighting for. You're 17. Tell your parents you're growing it into this hairstyle if you must. It's just messy and long, but it's not their decision to make any more. It's closer to feminine but it's not exactly short.  FWIW your hair grows millimetres at a time. It's the whole 1% thing. If you act just 1% more feminine a fortnight, you'll ""change"" at a rate that's so slow that nobody will even notice.

C) I imagine that whilst many people who are within any group may be more inclined to see a problem within relation to that group (when all you have is a hammer, every problem begins to look like a nail), the community as a whole will probably be well versed enough in the issues surrounding gender to be able to offer you some guidance. It's not about you being trans or trying to confirm or deconfirm that; it's about asking people who were so resolute on their own gender identity that they are undergoing transition, despite everything that incurs. Those sorts of people are collectively liable to know a lot more about the topic based on their years of experience and questioning. Other than that it sounds like you might need a bit of counselling man. Your school should offer some (and they will be discrete about it), and trust me, it's much easier to get counselling through an educational institution than it is in the real world."

If you think you can get away with 20-30 min every other day or an hour a week, you're basically lying to yourself. While yes, knowing how to play 4 chords is good, you will platu and you might wonder why you aren't getting better. Practice, practice, practice!  Start out with learning on holding the guitar and basic chords. (G, C, D, Am, Em) Work on those A LOT!  A lot of easy songs are made up of those chords. So learn those, and once you feel like you have them down, practice the transition between them. Just move between the chords. Don't ever get discouraged even if someone says you sound like a dying horse, because when you don't get stuff right on guitar, it won't sound pretty, but don't worry, we have all been there.  Hopefully your guitar teacher isn't incompetent ,like mine was, and can teach you more than just those chords. Hopefully he can teach you to read tabs and real sheet music. If were getting advanced maybe music theory.   Oh and It's never too late to learn. It gets harder as you grow older, but its never too late to learn. Guitar is deffinitly a perishable skill especially at first, and you won't be shredding with Vanhalen or ACDC anytime  soon. You can't expect amazing results over night, even over 6 months...  You really need to practice a lot and really focus if you want to get good. Its a common misconception that you suddenly pick it up in a week. Sorry to be harsh, but if you actually want to learn guitar this is the reality of it."

It's basicly a game you use on your  pc, and you'll need an electric guitar to plug into your computer. It has different songs and it shows you what you should play when, slowly building up if you get better (although you can adjust the difficulty yourself). It also has lessons showing you how to hold your guitar to more complex things. If you'll buy an electric guitar anyway its not that expensive, and I think it's a great tool to help you learn the basics and easier to pick up than following written instructions for example.   I quess you can best look up examples on youtube, because it's difficult to describe the system."

IWantToLearn,3c434p,ideoillogical,7,Sat Jul 4 16:38:19 2015 UTC,"As with most cities, the signal strength is reduced due to the tall buildings, so oftentimes the GPS itself doesn't know where you are.  Boston is also harder to navigate than most cities because the streets are literally old cowpaths that have been paved over.  There are random numbers of roads meeting at any given intersection, so something as simple as ""turn right"" can give you three different options.  On top of that, GPS directions are often delayed so long that by the time you finish hearing the instructions, you've gone past the intended turn.  And finally, even driving without an intended destination in Boston is an adventure.

Yes, ""turn right"" might mean several roads, and instructions might be long, but we usually solve that by looking at the displayed route on the map.

IWantToLearn,3c1veu,CorenSV,32,Sat Jul 4 00:06:33 2015 UTC,"Before I go on, I just want to say that you are describing the symptoms of ADHD. I encourage you to get evaluated by a psychiatrist or psychologist. Having a diagnosis makes a world of difference if you are in school, since you qualify for a lot of great resources that are designed to allow you to be productive despite having attention difficulties. And you don't have to take meds if you don't want to.   Anyway, try the following things:   Stimulus control: figure out what kinds of situations you work best in. Most people with attention difficulties need to reduce the opportunity for distraction (e.g., be alone in a quiet room, turn your phone off, wear headphones). However, you may find that you need some kind of background stimulus to keep you from getting too antsy. Instrumental music works really well. Vocals can be distracting. Time management: If you can only focus for 20 minutes at a time, then don't force yourself to focus for 40. Set a timer for 20 minutes and take a 10 or 5 min break to do something to get the ants out of your pants. Repeat as necessary. Stop beating yourself up: YOu've probably been told your whole life that having a short attention span is a bad thing that you should try to fix. Guess what? It's not. It's just how some people are. So reward yourself for the things you can achieve within the time you can attend to them. Even if you read 1 paragraph in those 20 minutes, tell yourself, ""hey, i got through a paragraph and didn't give up even though I had to re-read it 3 times."" Give yourself credit for trying. Stop dwelling on what you ""should"" be able to do. Exercise. Daily exercise actually primes the brain for learning. It doesn't have to be a ton, but at least 10 minutes at an elevated heart rate can make a big difference.    If that fails, consider ADHD medication. It's not the supervillian that people make it out to be. It can make all the things I listed above a bit easier to achieve on a regular basis."

Also, I know several people who have had ADHD all of their lives but only got diagnosed in grad school.

If you feel like your inability is not stemming from lack of motivation, it might very well be the case that it follows from neurological reasons.  This might sound off putting, but keep in mind that -- even if you have ADD or ADHD -- this inability to focus is probably 5% neurological and 95% bad habits which you accumulated along the way.  I started behavioral treatment with Ritalin about a decade ago, at 20, as a broke and depressed high school drop out without any accomplishments of any kind, and it turned out to be a first crucial step in turning my life around. The cool thing is that I can now do pretty well without Ritalin (though I keep taking it, for various reasons not directly related to ADHD)."

You can either focus on your natural rhythm, or you can take deep breaths of approximately equal inhale and exhale time.  If you're concerned about anything in particular, you may want to write it down before you start. That way, there's no pressure to remember any thoughts that come to you while you meditate. Distracting thoughts will probably intrude on your meditation, but if you can refocus yourself, they aren't a problem. Letting go of your thoughts might take a little bit of practice, but keep with it. I hope meditation does help you."

If you can't afford one, try a black t-shirt. Stick your head in the head hole so just your head is inside the shirt. Turn the shirt until your nose and mouth line up with the arm hole. Layer up excess fabric over your eyes to make it darker and roll or fold the sleeve away from your nose and mouth so you can breathe comfortably. Looks weird, works great, I find it comfortable unless it's super hot.  Amazon has a pretty decent selection of cheap blackout curtains.  For dealing with sound, get a white noise generator.

IWantToLearn,3bvf24,Krasso,37,Thu Jul 2 13:50:40 2015 UTC,"Create a schedule for your hobbies. Save it somewhere you can easily access it. If you can print it out and either carry it with you or place it somewhere you'll see it often (next to your computer monitor perhaps) then that's even better.  A schedule gives you accountability. You can't just say ""oh, I'll do it later"" or ""I'll start tomorrow"". Your schedule says you have to do it today. At 4pm.   That half hour right before bedtime that you normally spend on your phone scrolling through various feeds? Sunday to Saturday 11:30pm to midnight- meditation. Want to exercise five days a week? MWF 2pm to 3pm- running, TTh 2pm to 3pm- yoga.  Also, make your hobbies as easy to practice as possible. Keep your yoga mat out on the floor where you'll see it often (right next to your computer desk?). Then if you're on your computer and think about doing yoga, you can just get out of your chair and start doing yoga without the added effort of getting your mat out and what have you. Keeping books where you'll likely have idle time (eg. in the bathroom) will serve a similar purpose.  Often the reason we don't do what we tell ourselves we want to do is because the initial energy cost to start doing the thing just seems more trouble than it is worth. By decreasing this start-up cost we're better able to convince ourselves to do the thing.  TL;DR: Create a schedule, this gives you accountability. Decrease startup cost by making your hobbies as easily accessible as possible to make taking the first step easier."

Things that are easier to access and require less activation energy/motivstion to get working on or doing right away are favoured ( like watching TV almost no activation energy required thus always easy to do). As for lists i like using my phone for reminders and i have a schedule on it first page..  Also setup a self reward system that you can abide by without cheating. eg. When i compete tasks or whatever i have to do. I reward myself by hitting the bowl (maybe not ideal but it works very well for me)

If they start paying attention to those little subconscious impulses to pull out their phone and start browsing, they will notice how often it happens and the impulse will start to diminish naturally.  I would recommend to /u/Krasso that when you find yourself mindlessly browsing. Pay attention to how your body feels, your emotions. This might not stop you, but if you start to pay attention to how you feel, you may find you need a drink, or need to go to the bathroom. Take those opportunities to distance yourself from the tech, then find something else to do.  It's about learning to focus your attention into the present moment. Listening to the sound around you or feeling your body will disconnect you from the compulsive information gorging.  I found my way to mindfulness through Eckhart Tolle which has a spiritual bent. For more scientific and other approaches to the practice, try these."

Do 'productive' things that don't necessarily align with the goals you want to accomplish, but make you feel a sense of accomplishment anyway. I made myself a spreadsheet listing all the chores that need to be done in my house for each day of the week. Eventually it becomes habitual, then slowly start working towards those goals you've mentioned. Just don't burden yourself with doing everything, just focus on one thing and maybe work your way up from there.  Something that's actually worked really well for me is the app HabitBull. I've been using it for two months now. It started off simple like adding tasks like 'Meditate for 5 minutes a day', 'Eat less than 30 carbs a day' (I'm doing a keto diet) and 'Study for Driving Theory'. But I started adding more and more tasks, increasing the amount of time and honing in on goals.  While I'm at it, don't get in the mindset that sites like Reddit and Facebook are intrinsically bad. Everybody needs some downtime. Just learn to regulate that downtime. Also, don't exert yourself too much and don't condemn yourself when you fall off track.

If you want to do all these other things, and you know what it is you need to stop doing, then I would say the only answer to your question is just fucking do it. What exactly did you think people would say if you already have what you want to stop doing, and what you want to start doing already figured out?   Now that I'm done being a slight a-hole, I will say that one thing that has helped me is to schedule these things you want to do. It is sometimes surprising how big a difference it can make just to see how much time these activities you want to do take up in your calendar. If you run and meditate each for 20 minutes in a given day, that's probably about an hour all told. If you have a full time job with a commute, and get 8 hours of sleep/night, you really only have a few hours left over to accomplish these things. You also need to be aware that for every change you want to make in your life, something that you currently do needs to be taken away. That's opportunity cost man. Every habit you want to create for yourself will always come at the expense of whatever you were doing before. Maybe take a few days and try to audit how you're spending your time. Look at what you're doing, and try to figure out what specific activities you want to replace with what other specific activities. At the end of the day though, it's completely up to you."

Before bed, at work, cooking, before bed, etc. Notice what kind of thoughts and stimuli typically are associated with you checking those sites.  Because those are the things that lead you to doing what you're trying to avoid: things you see around you and things you think.  For example, I get up and think, ""well, let's check Reddit for a minute and then I'll get out of bed"". Then, of course, I'll spend far more time than I've planned on there and regret it later.  Noticing thoughts and triggers like that help you to control them. That's where our power to change ourselves comes from: better understanding why we do things.   So now that you have noticed thoughts and stimuli which tend to lead to the aversive behavior, realize that these things don't need to precede that action. This can help you slowly gain control of your actions. Each time you stop and notice this happening, you have a chance to stop it.

Others like to review their journal later. Some keep a dream journal to help them remember their dreams (it works too).  There are ways to organize your journal too. You can keep separate journals for different topics. Or categorize your journal by date, topic or something else.   When reading old journals, from more than a 1,000 years ago, I take note of things that I find interesting. Things like the way of life, geologic or meteorological wonders, my views of foreign cultures, scientific discoveries are all things I may take for granted now, but 1,000 years from now everything I know will only be known from reference material. If my journal is fortunate enough to survive it may provide valuable insight. Even mundane observations you make are unique. Many etymologists reference boring journals or sketch notes simply to take note of the first instance a word was used. Something as simple as your vocabulary is valuable.  For me, it really helped to pick out a journal i was happy with. I took a long time and decided on one with an attractive yet durable leather cover and removable journal booklet. I have a shelf of all the booklets i've filled up. The journal's size is compact enough to fit in my back pocket, but large enough to easily write on. I have line free pages which i love and let me draw occasionally next to my writing. The leather cover has a little pocket for 2 pens."

IWantToLearn,3bwfy0,greendog76,8,Thu Jul 2 18:37:20 2015 UTC,"If you already are decent at drawing and need to up your game, sighting will get you there. Basically, sighting is using something consistent like your thumb or pencil and using it to create a relative system of measurement for whatever you're drawing. Obviously it only works if you're drawing from life. Here's a youtube video about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Otv_l_qkML4  I learned this in a figure drawing course many years ago and would often use the head or foot (whichever was closest to me) as my system of measurement. So a reclining figure with her foot towards me may be four feet across, three feet vertical (accounting for perspective) and then I would also use a system of straight horizontal and vertical lines to make sure everything was in the right place (e.g. if i were to drop a string from the tip of her elbow, it would line up with her left big toe, or whatever.)  Other helpful infographics and skills for cartooning/drawing not from life:  Facial proportions  Basic body proportions using the head as a measurement tool  Cartoon facial expressions from the comic, Lackadaisy (seriously amazing infographic)  As with Photoshop, YouTube is your friend if you need specific tutorials, etc."

IWantToLearn,3bwfy0,suijuri,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:33:32 2015 UTC,Professional illustrator here.  The sighting guide above is only useful if you're doing realism.  Drawing is about much more than just recreating what you see.   There's flow and energy and composition and color and temperature and value.  As a designer you're already familiar with these things. Illustration is a subset of design.   Value is the most important of all. Even a line is just a value. Learn about them and how to create depth and composition with values.  The best way is to look at artists you love and how they use values.  I studied Paul Klee to understand what color meant to me.  Which artists you choose is a personal decision so I'm not going to suggest any.  Good luck.

IWantToLearn,3bweke,Shiranaru,7,Thu Jul 2 18:27:29 2015 UTC,"Go buy a 5 pound bag of potatoes and practice the basic cuts -  YouTube has plenty of videos on how to perform these.   The most important things are to pay attention to the grip (shake hands with the knife), the sharpness of the blade, and to break the items down into manageable squared off pieces.   At the end of the day, its all about muscle memory and it's something that is difficult to perfect in the home kitchen, unless you are making huge quantities of food for your family. Professional cooks spend literally months perfecting one or two cuts. Once they get those down, they move on to more precise cuts. The reason is partially aesthetics, but more for uniformity during the cooking process.   Good luck and don't forget to tuck your thumb. The stitches hurt worse than the cut does.   Edit - spelling"
IWantToLearn,3bweke,JustDoc,2,Thu Jul 2 18:58:46 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this.  Learn to keep a very sharp knife. Then just cut with it, a lot. Pare, slice, and chop are your basic cuts, and everything beyond that is pretty much a more accurate and smaller form, some combination of them, or is dependent on specific orientation.  And fold your fucking fingers under, use your knuckles as the guide against the flat of the blade, don't raise the edge above your knuckles."
IWantToLearn,3bweke,KazanTheMan,3,Fri Jul 3 06:30:07 2015 UTC,"As far as I'm aware, one of the tricks is to rest the flat of the knife against the last knuckle of your finger, and make sure the flat stays in contact with your knuckle for the duration of the cuts - that way the knife won't rise far enough to endanger any of your body parts. After that, using the knuckle as a measurement, slowly move the knuckle back along the food you're cutting, and begin cutting at a steady rate. This will help you move across in a regular fashion, and hopefully keep your slices regular too.  There is no substitute for practice or hard work, though, so keep at it!"

IWantToLearn,3byrgm,jparksup,2,Fri Jul 3 14:00:19 2015 UTC,"It's tough, and you have to spend a lot of time before you can do some of the most basic things.   /r/beatbox  Has a good spreadsheet for all the techniques with tutorials. Practice, practice, practice, practice.   Remember to practice.   The first 3 sounds you learn are the High Hat (denoted as T), kick drum, (B, or P) and the outward K snare (Ka).   To make the high hat (T), simply say T, as in Tee/Tea. The remove the Ee/Ea, you get the ""Tuh"" sound. What also helps is to imagine a snake hissing, With that T sound. Then shorten it down to a short Ts or keep it going for a Tss.   For the kick drum, say Bitch. Then shorten it to B, just the starting B. Now say B, while trying to keep your mouth tight and pressing the middle of your top and middle of your bottom lip close together, building air pressure behind it, like you're trying to resist calling your boss a bitch.   And for the Outward K snare, press the tip of your tongue on the rough ridge above your teeth on the roof of your mouth, then try to say K, you'll hear the slight sound of air coming under your tongue as you say K. Shorten it to just the Harsh K sound, instead of Kay.   A simple best to try is something like  Kick drum, High hat, Outward K, Kick drum High hat, Kick drum, Outward K, High Hat and repeat   B T Ka B T B Ka T  You can also add me on Skype: ZazMan117, but I only started 2 weeks ago.   Now in beatboxing tightening or loosening the mouth affects how you make your sounds. By tightening, press your lips together and try to bring them closer together, while pressing, then make the sound as your normally would.   Edit: I should mention, that I actually really like that beat because once your learn more sounds, like certain bases can be put at the end of a kick drum, or swap out different snares, then use different clicks or rolls or sound effects for the High Hats"

Now you'll have to play around with the fingers to make a slight V shape funnel...this is to force the air blown into it to make a sound.

I also play my favorite songs or use them as an alarm so that may work to make things less annoying and more enjoyable.

There were a few key habit changes that helped:  *bedtime alarm, not just wake up alarm, even if you don't go to sleep right then, it'll help you know how much you're staying up past when you should be going to sleep and help you change your pre bedtime habits.  *there's a lot of advice on ""sleep hygiene"" (check out /r/sleep) that is all definitely good advice to follow  *the biggest factor for me was a period of time where I was camping for work a lot, it really helped me set my sleep cycle in such a way that I was falling asleep soon after dark, and waking up at dawn. Now even a few years later I don't use an alarm and wake up naturally when I get the right amount of light and heat in the morning. I feel way better than when I was using an alarm because I feel like it lets me wake up at the shallowest part of my sleep cycle, rather than an arbitrary time.

For instance, there are some small businesses that will provide support across multiple devices, software, and operating systems. This requires a more general knowledge that I believe is best obtained by on the job experience. However, you can choose to take a more specialized path and become an expert in Windows server 2012 or Microsoft Exchange. The best place to start for almost anyone though is the A+ exam. You can find resources for studying for it online. It really is not a difficult test so with some study it should be pretty easy to pass. This industry relies heavily on certifications for validation. If you walk into a job and say you are A+, Network+, CCNA, CCNP, Security+, and MCSE (Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert) certified, you have a really good chance. If you just have A+ though, you can land a job with a few help desk places and get some experience. While on the job, you can get a feel for what you like (Programming, Troubleshooting, Software Design etc...). Once you have an idea, start studying and taking some cert tests.

It looks like she's either not getting enough sleep or not resting enough while she sleeps. Some of the things that would help are making the room as dark as possible, avoiding bright screens about 1-2 hours before sleeping, or get an app called f.lux which takes of the blue light (the one that mess up your melatonin) of your pc or mac screen. Make the room a little colder, avoid caffeine after 4pm, avoid alcohol hours before sleep. Those tricks should help. There's a great book on everything there is to know about sleep ""Counting Sheep: The science and pleasures of sleep and dreams"" She could also take some melatonin to help her sleep better but talk to a doctor first. Some tea will also help. If those things don't work, you can also get an app that senses your sleeping cycle and wakes you up during your light sleep. You give the app a 30min window to wake you up and it choses the best time to do so. There are several apps out there for that and they help you wake up more refreshed. The problem might be that she's waking up while she's in REM and that's not a good time to wake up. Finally, I know that I am making this a little too long, She might have a vitamin or mineral deficiency that makes her have low energy and the body tries to compensate with more sleep. Take a look at her nutrition and if possible get blood test to see if she's low on anything.

It will help you to start to visualize the word in your head. For example, if I said to you, ""cat"" do you see a cat or the word cat? This is important. You need to see the word, if you want to improve. Here are some tips from me. No one taught me this. I have been able to say polysyllabic words, names, phrases and whole sentences backwards since I was wee. That doesn't mean you must be born with it to be able to do it like curling your tongue.    * Say your name backwards out loud. Rinse and repeat.* Start with monosyllabic words.    * Practice, practice, practice. Great advice /u/TerrorYoshi    * If you want to say them on command (Which can be very fun at a party or in a gathering. Just ask anyone their name and say it to them backwards. Kaboom they have a new name and they can sometimes sound very funny)    IMO the key is to practice saying it OUT LOUD.    * Say the alphabet out loud backwards. Rinse and repeat. (It is a lot harder than you may think) I have been doing this for a long time and the hardest thing I ever said backwards was the Alphabet. Think about it...26 letters in a continuous string which when viewed in your head either forwards or backwards is not a ""word"", but each letter is a syllable and can be viewed as a word.

For me it was mainly the idea of someone putting a needle in my vein that caused me to push myself into a panic attack. The way I was able to overcome it was to actually donate blood. It took me like 3 visits until I was actually able to relax enough for them to draw blood. Although it was terrifying, it was actually pretty rewarding afterwards. Since the needle has to be in for a long time I was able to grow accustomed to it, and knowing that donating had been my choice and not a medical necessity made me feel in control. Plus, it's for a great cause and that's as good of a reason as any to attempt to overcome your fear!

For some reason the thing that helped me get over the fear was actually seeing the needle before they put it in me and watching it go in...I know it's pretty counter-intuitive but that's what worked for me.   I think it was something to do with the fact that when you're younger they always make you close your eyes and not look before the injection. Knowing there was some sort of needle but not knowing the size of it made my imagination run wild then imagining having this pain from the needle going into me became unbearable. After watching it happen I could see how small that damn needle usually is and the tiny little prick of pain that follows is something I don't need to worry about.   But yea, ever since I started looking at the needle they were using and watching them use it my little bullshit fears were washed away.

Secondly, that classic gear never really sounded that great.  A raw 808 kick really isn't that impressive.  Old digital gear often had odd-ball bit depth, and very limited memory, so they used all sorts of filtering and tricks to 'sound better'- which gave them some unique characteristics.

In general, it's all coming from my sub /r/theverymask. If you have specific questions, I'll also answer those to the best of my ability.     Probably the most directly applicable are Elements of Intelligence and wanting to be smarter, To Better Remember, Conversation & Response Types, and the twins The Failure of Labels vs Rigorous Definition and Virtue of Brevity. You may also find Early Meditations helpful.    Fluent articulation has always come easily to me, but the next level came with a pair of exercises:  Firstly, take some long piece of text you were going to read anyway for me it was Cracked articles and read it aloud as quickly and clearly as possible. When I'm going for sheer pace my upper limit with minimal error is about 380 words per minute on an unpracticed text, but that's after quite a bit of practice. Once you're comfortable with a bit of speed, mix up the stressing, timing, and pitch of delivery to accentuate important words and highlight the meaning in those sentences at speed to improve clarity of understanding. You will seldom be reading from a script, but I've found that it has improved my ability to smoothly construct sentences without falter or chaff. You can learn to speak like you've prepared even when you haven't.  Second is the much harder challenge of describing the indescribable. This treads heavily on the concept of rigorous definitions so I recommend you read the corresponding article. Anything that can be seen or thought can be phrased, and quickly phrasing something effectively is a useful skill that comes with practice. Explain things that are difficult to explain like what sadness is. Start with things that you understand but have a hard time putting to words. Some of these things will take a great deal of work, but most can be put into a single breath especially after the first exercise. It may be useful to look at things and consider how you would explain it to a child while being as honest as possible.    Some basic things you can do often:   Question basic things you take for grant'd, but try to work out the answers yourself for at least a full day before looking them up. Why, for example, does 10 mean ten? At least consider an interest in math if you don't yet have one. Math is one of the only purely mental disciplines, and to truly understand it develops a very different kind of thinking. It also underpins all possible realities, which is a nifty bonus. Consider ViHart if you don't think it can be interesting or fun. Try to notice when you use deconstructive rather than reconstructive thinking, then attempt the opposite on the same subject. Very common in media criticism. Deconstruction is following through the logic of something, often to see what effects something would have and is frequently used to show something is implausible or would have drastic consequences. Reconstruction is about justifications that would result in the original state. Broadly, at least the way I use the words, they're respectively explaining why something wouldn't work and what would have to be true to make it work. An example is Iron Man being hit by a plane or etc and surviving. Deconstruction: ""With an impact like that, no amount of armour is going to save you from the internal damage of suddenly accelerating like that. At best, your brain sloshing around would give you the worst concussion of your life."" Reconstruction: ""It could work if he has repulsors inside his suit that spread incoming force evenly throughout his body. This would also mean you could hit him faster than the repulsors could react to or safely accelerate him as a buffer, but he's insulated from most impacts in the line of duty."" Don't be satisfied with one explanation. Many things have multiple factors that contribute to them, or a least multiple ways of explaining the same effect. I can think of 5 different explanations for how multiplication works off the top of my head. Why do objects of different masses fall at the same rate? You could explain that in terms of distribution, scaling, or inertia. Break things down into elements to better understand how they interact and produce the thing. This is a favourite of mine, and I'll be doing it next to relationships.   Edits separated by horizontal rules."

Researchers and scientists keep putting out new definitions and findings all the time. there is a popular theory these days by psychologist Howard Gardner. He talks about 9 different types of intelligence. You can google his name to find out what all 9 of them are about. Basically he wants to make a point that intelligence is not related to knowledge or tests, there are other intelligences such as musical or social intelligence. It is unfortunate that our systems values academic intelligence above all others.  Not to make this reply too long, I just want to say that you shouldn't feel bad for not getting the best grades, that's not the only measure of intelligence.  Also, if you are a great dentist, no one will perceive you as dumb. Be great at your field and you will be highly respected.  Finally, read a lot, other people said it here and they are absolutely right. Read a lot not just so you have knowledge, but so you expand your mind to new ideas. Cheers"

We're entering an era where it is going to be impossible to memorise everything - 98% of the information in the world was generated in the past two years.  So we have to look to new strategies.  As a former professor I have always believed that there is a massive discrepancy between intelligence and ""ability to do well in exams"".  Obviously you'll have to pass some exams in order to qualify, but don't worry about the grades.  It won't make any difference whether you pass with flying colours or just scrape by - two days after the results nobody cares, so don't compare yourself to your peers.     I would hate to be perceived as a dumb dentist by my patients   I very much doubt that any patient would doubt the skill of their dentist.

You will be able to hear so much more. I learned this from my guitar teacher when he was teaching me how to learn songs ""by ear"" We didn't have all the TABs and internet resources we have today.  Other than that, listen to a lot of music, it will develop your taste and your ear. If you want to know things that are more technical then find a friends that plays an instrument or that knows a lot about music and spend some time with him or her discussing songs. Other than that, don't forget that music is about MUSIC, the sounds you hear. Whatever it is that electrifies your body is what you should listen to regardless of what's considered great music by others. Cheers"

IWantToLearn,3bn5fu,ArcaneTeaParty,16,Tue Jun 30 15:45:15 2015 UTC,"It is something that will come with age, as long as you devote to it. But don't just try to find the deeper meaning of song lyrics, try to find the deeper meaning of poems, books, movies, video games, or even things people say. What you're actually asking is how to work that creative center of your brain which is responsible for interpreting communications, so things like ""Improving your listening skills when talking to others"" will improve this skill you want.  So make questions your purpose, not answers. Listen to the view of others, do so patiently, even if you don't agree or understand. Finding how others interpret lyrics will add to your list of skills.  Follow these general rules. They are not 100% answers, but they are good go to answers.  1: Love is almost always the answer. As a cliche, so many songs are about how much two people love each other, and a lot of those songs are about how a man loves a woman. But there are also songs about earnest pleas for sympathy, rejections of love, or misunderstanding of love. It may seem peculiar to categorize dance songs as songs about love, but aren't we creating an experience for large quantities of drugged and drunk individuals to move as a single unit, a temporary community? Is that not a form of love?  Most of the works of mankind can be interpreted through a lens of ""How does this relate to loving people?""  2: Some songs aren't about anything. That doesn't mean you shouldn't look for meaning. I've heard it said that Vertical Horizon's lyrics are mostly nonsense, RadioHead chooses lines from out of a hat, the song closing time is ostensibly about the birth of one of the bandmember's first children, though this isn't really reflected easily in the lyrics. Chili Peppers lyrics are soooo abstract sometimes that it requires a particular kind of madness to find meaning in them. But look anyway, because if you find meaning where there was no intended meaning, you are exercising the part of your imagination that interprets signals as communications. This is also important for creativity.  /3. Understand that not all song lyrics have deep and complex meanings. Frank Sinatra liked to perform a lot of music which was essentially ""The world is great, here is a list of metaphors that describes how great I feel about the world"". The Doors lyrics don't always add up to a coherent, expressible thought, but very often invoke images that express emotions, as a friend of mine once put it. Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds, a Beatles classic, really boils down to ""Children's Drawings are awesome!"" These songs aren't really about the lyrics, but the lyrics are an important part of delivering the experience that the author wants you to have.  Listen to bob dylan. I knoooooow. I know. He is so so so hard to listen to, but the man is a master of lyricism. He uses very simple but still aesthetically pleasing forms of language to express consistent emotional qualities about the human experience, and he knows how to use instrumentation to carry those lyrics without overpowering them. Or... well he used to. I recommend ""The Times They are a Changing""  Here's a homework assignment. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwXai-sgM-s This song can be kind of rough if it's not your taste. If it helps at all, recognize that the beat goes like ONE two three ONE two three ONE two three as opposed to the more common ONE two three four ONE two three four.  But listen to this song, comprehend the lyrics, and try to express what is happening here without the artistry of lyrics and sound. It's really hard to express exactly what the madness of the narrator is in simpler terms."

Do one thing a day! Anything more than what you'd usually do. Do a load of laundry, read a single chapter from your textbook, do 15 minutes worth of physical activity, learn the basics of a skill that interests you.  Simply make the effort of dedicating 15 minutes a day to any task that breaks from your usual unproductive routine, and don't expect yourself to change overnight, remind yourself that the fact you made an effort in those 15 minutes is something worth feeling good about.   As you make a short effort, and you feel that is something you're comfortable with, make more efforts to pushing yourself further and further until you're truly satisfied with your day. Take it slow! When you've been living as you have for years (in my case) it's not realistic to expect yourself to wake up one morning a new person.

This website is a government site that should give you some decent info on maintaining good credit.    If you already have credit, but you're struggling with making the payments, this site has good information about how you can lower your monthly payments so they better fit in your budget.  Making your payments each month is essential for good credit, and can be hard to do if your payment is too high.

IWantToLearn,3bkxnq,GumShoos,21,Tue Jun 30 01:46:09 2015 UTC,"It depends who you are telling the story to, and what sort of story it is. Let's assume it's an amusing anecdote and you're telling someone you know.  Start off telling it casually, as if there is nothing exceptional about it and aim to reveal the points of interests one at a time, rather than in one large dump at the end. For example, if you wanted to talk about how you had lost your shoes on a night out and had ended up having to walk home barefoot for hours, you wouldn't simply say that. You'd tell the story, of how it was a normal night out, you'd been for a few drinks with some friends and mention something amusing that happened while you were doing that. (This will capture your audience's attention). Continue to talk about how you were doing something which led to you losing your shoes, and how your night continued from there. Even thought you've mentioned the shoes going missing, you don't need to say 'and then I walked all the way home barefoot'. Rather continue telling the story, how you searched for them, how you continued to have a good time regardless etc. Then to end the story you would say something along the lines of 'and of course I didn't realise I was going to have to walk the whole way home, without them'.   Obviously that's just an example, but you can see how it would translate to any story you tell. Ultimately the story should have more than one aspect to it, not just I walked home barefoot, or I lost my shoes. Having the two together make it more interesting, a third aspect is even better. So make sure you're telling a story people will want to hear, and tell it in a way that keeps them engaged.   I assume you mean telling stories orally, and in that case try not to sound nervous. Use the tone of your voice to signal when the story is getting more interesting, and for almost any story the key to keeping people attentive is to make sure there is at least some humor to it.  This might all feel unnatural, and when explain like this it is, but its what many people do naturally when they tell a story.   TL;DR - Make sure it's a story worth telling, tell it slowly (with a steady voice) and know what points you want to convey before you start."

IWantToLearn,3bkxnq,DrJackov,3,Tue Jun 30 22:01:37 2015 UTC,"I've been storytelling in Hollywood and beyond for the last 5 years and the key to a good storyteller is speaking without fear.  The story should also be about an interesting and uncommon experience with a strong point of view. It can also be a common experience with a novel view.  But mainly, if you tell your story without fear or trepidation you look interesting. If not you look silly. I've seen stand-ups who are great comedians do storytelling and bomb because they became unsure mid story.   Usually the people who start their stories with, ""Here are three times I went on a bad date..."" or ""here are four times I met a monkey..."" fail for the same reason. They tell the first number story and then they don't get a reaction from the audience. Fear sets in and they suddenly seem irritating.  The only way to work up to being fearless in expression is to push yourself to tell stories publicly. Force yourself to the center of attention without care for your audience. Sometimes I think of it like, I'm holding a bomb inside of me and if I don't throw it at this audience it will kill me instead. Kill the audience!  I'm not saying be rude to the audience, they will love your confidence and you will find that whatever you are talking about will be very interesting, almost magically. And if not, who cares, you just flexed a muscle that will only grow.  Also do open mics, as many as you can, it really helps.

That requires me to have a good grasp of the basic math involved, like knowing algebraic rules off the top of my head.

IWantToLearn,3bikrt,Prince-Cola,95,Mon Jun 29 14:56:44 2015 UTC,"Shaving basics:  (1) Wet hair is soft hair.  Shave after a shower to save time, or lather up with shaving cream or whatever and wait around 3-5 minutes for the hair to soften.  This is the main reason dry shaving (even with an electric razor) sucks and will never end up as close and smooth as a proper wet shave.  If you're dry shaving, that's the cause of your stubble problem right there.  (2) Always use a shaving cream, foam, or gel.  Soap works in a pinch, but avoid it as a general thing: it will dry your face and give you complexion issues.  Shaving properly is dragging a sharp knife over your skin to cut off the hair right at the surface. That requires lubricant so the knife won't catch on your skin.  A proper cream or gel will also soften the hairs (so they cut easier) and swell them a little (so they stick out farther and you can get a closer shave).  (3) Get a double-edge safety razor.  It's easier to learn basic shaving with some of the disposables, but ultimately better with your own razor.  /r/wicked_edge will have some good recommendations, but also lots of attitude.  A solid, reliable safety razor will cost you about the same amount as a disposable cartridge setup and 10 cartridges, so it's not just cheaper ""in the long run"", DE shaving is cheaper ""now"" as well as just better.  A nice midrange DE razor to try is the Parker 99R (about $33), which will last you for decades; or if you want cheap cheap, try this cheapo one from Amazon, at $7. The razors require disposable double-edge blades, so they're really ""razor holders"" just like good ballpoint pens are really ""pen refill holders"". Astra is a good midrange blade - hard enough to last for 2-3 shaves per edge if you want to stretch them out, sharp enough to do a good job. You can buy 100 blades for $10, which is enough for over a year's worth of daily shaving.  But there are maybe half-a-dozen popular brands, and people tend to get loyal to their particular brand.   (4) If you must go fully disposable (sigh, you'll learn one day), use Gillette Good News razors or equivalent -- they're about the optimal performance/price ratio, and you can get a couple of good shaves out of each one.  Fancier disposables don't really buy you much other than glitz, and cheap cheap disposables are a pain to use.  (5) To remove stubble, and get the smoothest shave, shave three times:  once DOWN, once UP, and once FORWARD.  That is: fully lather and soften, shave with down strokes (thereby wiping the cream off), then lightly lather and shave with up strokes, then lightly lather and shave with forward strokes.  (6) Aftershave is sort-of optional but very nice.  It's alcohol that you splash on your face after you finish with the blade and rinse any remaining cream off.  It typically has some scent in it.  It helps retract the stubble, and sterilizes any nicks you may have made.  I like bay rum styles, other people like others.  Get the smallest bottle you can until you find a scent you like.   (7) To shape your beard, decide how you want it and shave in the places it isn't: it's as simple as that at first.  Until your beard comes in thick and scratchy all over your face, you probably won't get good results cultivating it (aka not shaving parts of your face).  Once you let it grow in a bit, you want to get a fine comb and either SHARP scissors or a trimmer, to maintain it.  A fine comb is like $1, a trimmer is like $15, and good scissors will set you back like $30.  Playing with different beard/stache/sideburn styles and lengths is an important part of the process -- plan on trying 3-5 different styles over the course of a year, before you settle down.  There are no rules, only fun."

When shaving the upper portion of the bottom lip, continue passes down the sides of the chin, so that the only part of the round of the chin is an inch or so wide (because the round of the chin is really difficult anyhow) Shave round of chin Repeat across the grain, and against the grain, if so desired Quickly rinse the blade and dry it on the towel, set aside until the post-shave is complete Rinse the face well, first with hot water, then with cold to tighten pores, and pat dry with another towel; avoid wiping face with hands or towel If any nicks, use a styptic pencil; any razor burn, use alum block Apply witch hazel aftershave; no wiping motions Start to clean shaving station with sponges and towels (this allows the witch hazel time to set your pores) Pat on aftershave balm—do not rub or wipe Rinse brush out, and squeeze to remove excess lather; shake out water and hang brush to dry Make sure blade is completely clean, washing as necessary and drying (consider dipping the blade in alcohol 1. to aid evaporation, and 2. to prevent mineral buildup) Apply a few drops of oil to the blade and rub in with fingers   EDIT: formatting"

The blade gets clamped so that only like a millimeter sticks out, so you simply can't make any cuts deeper than about a millimeter.  The blades themselves are another story, but they're flimsy enough that you really can't do much serious damage without clamping and supporting them in some way."

One thing that you have in your favour is that you already play string instruments so you already have developed control and independence in your fingers and your hands. For that reason Switching to guitar or bass should be easier for you than someone starting from scratch.  I would say that you should start with the instrument you like the most and then learn the other one. That being said, I have friends that have moved from guitar to bass and others that have moved from bass to guitar; The ones that learned guitar first had an easier time moving to bass. The one thing that I would insist on is that if you want to learn to play electric guitar, start playing ELECTRIC guitar, don't start with acoustic as many people will tell you. The reason I say that is that even though there seems to be good reasons to start with acoustic, you won't be playing what you like and won't be getting the sounds you want. Don't forget that music above all is about music! the sounds you make and hear. If you don't like acoustic guitar don't learn guitar in an acoustic guitar it will kill your motivation and that's the most important thing to have."

Guitars starting in the $250 range should serve you well at first  2) Determine your goals. Do you want to join a band (hence the bass goal) eventually? Is there a particular song you want to learn or write your own stuff? Just what your expectations of yourself are.  3) Find a local instructor. Fuck those self-taught shitty-ass guitarist. You want to get from point a to point b with as little trouble as possible so having someone personally help you get there is very important. Ask about instructors on your local city's subreddit and get a few options. Call them on the phone and talk for a few minutes. Discuss the goals mentioned above and how they'd help you reach them. Draw them a clear picture, it'll help. Book a lesson with two or three of them and make a judgement on who best fits you. That's important, and worth the effort.  4) Seek new challenges. At first, everything seems like a rocketship, but that'll slow after a bit. The key is to keep finding new areas to work on. Play everyday, at least 15 minutes of concentrated practice. Not jamming, PRACTICE. You'll grow fast.   5) Lastly, two tips. Always practice slowly and perfectly. It's far better to develop good technique and have good chops than to be sloppy. And second, learn the Major Scale in all five positions on the neck. Understanding it is the key to understanding how chords work, how other scales fit and how to create melodies and basslines. It's fairly simple, just takes some memorization but it is the keys to kingdom and will put you miles ahead of others as you head down the path. Makes everything much easier."

The point that supposed to be taken from that is that trying not to think of something is impossible. Humor is very much the same, that if you say something funny to be funny it will fail. It will feel forced because that's exactly what's happening.   Humor is about confidence and honesty. The little truths that we all have and ether don't realize or want to understand, if you say something without confidence it's off putting because that's naturally what's being addressed.  The trick to actually being funny is to relax, have fun, say what honestly is your reaction.  I know that this all is way harder and scarier then above described but that's true of anything that's worth it. It might seem that it's easier for other people, but it's really not. I saw someone else on here suggest an improv class and that's really great advise. Improv groups are like an awesome safe group of friends that you can really explore yourself and get confidence.   I hope you find what your looking for and wish you luck!"
IWantToLearn,3biqxj,PoetKing,4,Mon Jun 29 19:55:31 2015 UTC,"This is a weird theory that I've kind of mulled together over the years: humor is truth.  You see, whenever people have tried to declare something as never funny, it seems to invariably produce a response that gets a laugh out of somebody. The point that most people get to is that everything can be funny in the right context. Yes, even horrible things can be presented in just the right context that somebody will laugh.  I've done a bit of work with improv comedy before, and it's interesting to see the weird things people will laugh at. One big thing a lot of improv classes tell you is not to try to make jokes, because you'll get more laughs out of just trying to be normal on a stage. What makes people laugh is the recognition: a girl is ""in her room"", getting ready for her day, and she stops and checks her but in the mirror, or a guy admires his muscles in the mirror, and everybody laughs. It's not that the moment had a punch line to it, it's just that the audience saw the truth in it:they'd all done that at some point in their life, and seeing it happen with someone else brought that recognition.  Jokes can be the same, in a way. We've all seen comedians call out specific groups of people for acting in a specific way, and regardless  of whether the observation was deliberately funny people will laugh because they understand what the comedian is saying. The humor isn't necessarily in what was said, but in the way it evokes a moment of recognition between the comedian and the audience.  That's the biggest reason that some jokes fall flat or make people angry: the audience doesn't have the shared understanding needed to find it funny. Maybe they have a reason to believe that the subject matter shouldn't be insulted, or maybe they just see things a different way than you do. And when that happens your joke alienates you from the audience, which makes it harder to be seen as funny.  Really, the first thing you need to do to be funny is know yourself. Be prepared to say something with confidence, in a way that allows your audience to understand your meaning. Then work on wit: take what you want to say, and twist it so that your meaning isn't clear until the last possible second (""Take my wife...please, take her""). Sometimes, the twist itself can be humorous beyond the subject you're talking about. Lastly, work on knowing your audience: know what they'll be defensive about, and what they'll be taking too seriously. Most people won't enjoy a joke about a recent tragedy, but a few people might; you need to know the people you're telling the joke to before you take a risk like that. If someone's touchy on a subject, you should avoid it in your jokes if you want them to laugh: if they get defensive, they feel separated from you and the people who laugh, and it's that feeling of togetherness that gets laughs."

Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. And sometimes, when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals–sounds that say listen to this, it is important.”  ― Gary Provost"

If you practice often you will get better is inevitable. Also, like others here have suggested, read the writers you like. Try to copy their style at first, there's nothing wrong with that, we all learn by imitation. Then when you start to get better, you'll organically develop our own style.  I'm also trying to improve my writing and been reading about the subject for some time now. My favorite books so far are:  ""On Writing Well"" by William Zinsser. He's such a good writer that I wasn't able to put the book down, I would be reading everywhere, and it's just a book about writing.  He says that one of the keys to writing is re-writing. All writers have to rewrite, that's the key to their craft. We think that great writers just sit in front of a blank page or computer screen and effortlessly write an amazing first draft. That's not how it happens.  Another good book is ""Bird by bird"" by Anne Lamott.  Hope that helps. Cheers."

Your chest resonators in theory are the ones that add more depth and lower tones to your voice but that's not the only thing you should focus on. Releasing tension, proper breathing and right projection will make your voice fill the room and have more power.  A lot of people want a deeper voice because it feels more commanding or attractive, and there is some truth to that. I don't know if that's your case, but if it is, don't worry so much. We are not conscious of how low our voice really is (most of the time is lower than we think) but most importantly, proper voice control will give you a commanding, powerful voice regardless of how low your voice is. On a final note, forcing your speaking voice too low will damage your voice, so just be careful. Cheers"

You'll likely feel the vibration near the top of your throat, near the nasal cavity.   Basically, try to move that vibration down towards your chest, the deeper down it goes, the deeper your voice will be.

There is also a calculus course on Edx, it started a few weeks ago though. MIT OCW has a bunch of different calculus courses too. However, there are no automated gradings and assignments for MIT OCW, so you need to look at the problem sets/exercises and compare your answers against the solutions.

However, if you just want to know what calculus is all about in and of itself, I wouldn't suggest those things. They're too technical and focused on computations over concepts. There's a difference between learning to play the guitar through scales, picking exercises, and memorizing your circle of fifths, and simply picking strings and seeing what works.  I don't have a great suggestion for what books or sources would be good for this, but a quick google search lead me to this Dover book http://www.amazon.com/History-Calculus-Conceptual-Development-Mathematics/dp/0486605094 Dover is cheap and usually pretty good, so check this out.

So get yourself a spiral bound notebook and do that.  Next you can refine it by adjusting your spacing, size, and slant and any other details you might want to change like commas, apostrophes, punctuation and all that  I should also say that it is important to make the conscious effort to stick to your new style anytime you write something.

I have been ironing for years and due to my current occupation I am required to iron and have my uniform perfect every day. Additionally I iron my everyday clothes as well.   First off, if you have crappy equipment then you are going to have a much harder time.  I personally own a $90-100 dollar Rowenta, they are highly regarded in my career field and I have owned a $50 dollar one as well. Shark is another great brand. The main thing that you should be looking for in a good iron is the manual steam setting and how powerful it is.  When it comes to the ironing board I made my own from plywood, headliner padding, and cotton fabric to wrap the board. The cheap $15 ironing boards work great but they break super fast and the wire mesh that holds the top together often gets bent. Some ironing boards have small sleeve ironing boards that rotate out from under the board and can be useful if you want a pressed sleeve without a crease.  As for the ironing process, practice makes perfect. Cotton is the easiest to iron and requires high heat with high steam. I typically turn off the auto steam and press an area while pressing the manual steam button a couple of times to make it moist then stop pressing the button and basically press and dry the area before moving to the next.  It's probably a no brainer but don't forget to ensure that any extra material on the under side of the clothing item is flattened to avoid wrinkles on the back. For dress coats and suit tops I use a rolled up towel inside of the shoulder and arms so that you can press and steam to remove tough to get wrinkles in the arms and around the shoulder seam.  I hope this information helps, just let me know if you have any specific questions.  Stay sharp."

Are you confused on how to tell a quarter note from an eighth note? Are you having trouble with EGBDF being the lines and FACE being the spaces? You said you know scales and chords - if I said to play a ""D"" chord, could you? Or a ""D"" scale?  You need to find something you want to learn - a particular song or type of music. Then get yourself the sheet music for it. You can start easy, but nobody truly wants to learn ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" or even ""The Happy Farmer.""  If you want to learn classical music, well, there are plenty of places where you can find easy music online. If you want to learn rock/pop, you might consider getting a ""fake book"" - these consist of the chords and a melody line with lyrics. You can sing the melody line while playing the chords (at the most basic, the root note of the chord with the left hand, the chord with the right hand), or you can use the melody line to help you learn to read the music. You can also look up just about any song title and add the word ""chord"" to get the chords someone has figured out for it - you won't get the melody line, but you'll be able to play the song. Find an easy song like a blues song that has three chords - ""Pride and Joy"" is G, A, B, A, G.  You could also get an ""easy"" music book of the genre you like, which includes music for left and right hands, and use it to get used to reading the notes.  But what you really need to do is practice. There are no short-cuts. You'll improve in proportion to the amount of practicing you do. And if, in a few weeks, you are frustrated, go back to the first thing you tried to learn and see how much better you are at playing it than when you started."

After listening to the music, search the composer and read up their lives. Read their bio, on wikipedia por example, and understand their way of thinking and how their music evolved throughout their lives. Beethoven, for example, had 3 major musical periods; as his live went through changes, so did his music. Only when you understand the mind of the composer, and the musical period in each they lived, can you start to really understand the music they created. Each piece they made is a whole different world of emotions, so the first step is to understand who created them."

It's easy to think of all these crusty old dudes existing at some unspecified time in the past cranking out piece after piece but keep in mind that many lived hundreds of years apart and, because of  this, some greatly influenced others down the line.  Each composer has a unique style or flavor.  Like today's musicians, they typically strove to set themselves apart.    Many times, that uniqueness tied directly to their personality.  Take Mozart, for an example.  That guy was a character and LOVED to show off and force his audiences to squirm a bit.  One of his signature ""flavors"" was his amazing talent for elaboration on known themes.  Basically, he'd take a common tune and just add crazy beautiful shit in between the parts.

IWantToLearn,3beoaa,IronyGiant,2,Sun Jun 28 16:58:04 2015 UTC,"My knowledge of classical music mostly comes from classical piano. What a lot of people call ""classical"" is actually a vague term that can be split into several rough time periods with distinct differences. For example:  Baroque (1600 - 1750)   Often has multiple distinctly independent melodies and rhythms that repeat and blend together. The ""mood"" of each section generally stays consistent e.g. if it begins ""happy"", it will stay ""happy"" to the end. Many piano pieces from this time were actually written for the harpsichord, not the modern piano. Volume changes are terraced and abrupt. The sustained effect that comes from holding down piano keys or the sustaining pedal is avoided. Some well-known composers: Bach, Handel, Vivaldi   My impression: Baroque music is like an intricately woven fabric where every melody is like a thread that complements the others, or maybe a complex mosaic of geometric shapes. It's ornamental, dense and textured.  Classical (1750 - 1830)   Simpler and clearer melodies than the Baroque period (usually one melody at a time with accompaniment) Larger contrasts between moods, melodies, etc. but the tempo/speed is generally consistent within each part Some well-known composers: Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven's early works; his later works are Romantic   My impression: The word I'd choose is mathematical. Classical music is very structured. I have mental images of a pointed Gothic arch or the curves of a jet - highly distinctive shapes resulting from rule-based design that are beautiful because they are engineered. Because of the clearer melodies, it sounds more clean-cut than Baroque music.  Romantic (1830 - 1920)   More emotional, expressive and lyrical than Classical music with less restrictive structure Frequent inspiration from cultural, artistic, nationalistic, literary or natural sources Some well-known composers: Chopin, Debussy, Beethoven's later works   My impression: There's more variety than before so I'll just pick a bunch of adjectives: emotional, sensory, descriptive, symbolic and subjective.  Contemporary (1920 - )   Huge variety, lots of experimental stuff"

And for example the clouds movement in Nocturnes by Debussy is very light, airy with no real recognizable chorus, kinda like clouds.

Instead of picking a ""side"" I suggest actively considering as many viewpoints on the subject as possible. Here's an example. Russia is being a dick about the Ukraine,  but look at how they see it. They were a superpower and used to control that area. Now they're militarily oppressed by U.S. bases outside of their boarders and the only way to regain some power to fortify and increase protection of their country and culture is to gain strategic areas back while the U.S. President still seems too weak to really oppose them. they seek to take an inch while they still can.  That wasn't really well put but if you look at Russian history from their viewpoint you'll see how it is from their perspective. Putin's still a dangerous lunatic and we should be ready to defend against possible attacks on NATO soil at any moment but the liberal or conservative or communist view on that issue means little in reality.

You're basically asking where you can cherry pick information to support your views- is that really an informed person?   But I suppose I'll try to answer your question about information supporting liberal views. I still am uninformed on a lot of financial issues, but I found just learning about human behavior and psychology made me more liberal on social issues. (I majored in special education, so we talked a lot about inequality, poverty, learned helplessness, cultural/socioeconomic effects on people's behavior/thinking etc. which I think are things connected to social issues liberals are concerned with)  If you want to find historical examples of success from leftist policies as well as the effects of the left on social issues, I could recommend ""learning from the left"" by Michael Kazin. I had to read it for my capstone class (History of Socialism in America) to finish my double major in history.   It sounds like you're setting out to enter a debate to show others they're wrong. I would say a debate shouldn't be about proving each other right or wrong (unless you're on a debate team I guess), it should be about finding an understanding of one another and finding a conclusion you can agree with (even if it's realizing that you have fundamental differences in beliefs that can't be reconciled). I think a very effective technique in debating is to try to analyze the same sources your opponent uses since they've already shown that they trust/respect this source. It's rarely that hard to come up with confounding variables to explain statistics or studies. And if you really can't argue with them effectively, maybe try and see where they may be right. When approaching someone with a different viewpoint attempt to understand before trying to be understood. They're convinced in their viewpoint for some reason- I always try to approach my initial analysis of somebody's viewpoint by doing everything in my power to agree with them and ask clarifying questions to find out what they may know/think that I don't that led them to their conclusion.   A metaphor: Imagine two people on either side of a scary looking wooded area. Neither of them wants to cross to the other person's side so they just shout things to try and convince the other person to come over. If one person was bold enough to cross over on their own, they'd probably have better luck convincing the other person to cross back over with them now."

However, from what I've noticed, most people look for the 'easy way out' of nutrition and fitness while there is actually no 'easy way'. For fitness, 30 minutes a day, or at least 2.5 hours of moderate exercise every week is what the body needs to sustain healthy amounts of HDL (high-density lipoprotein, or the healthy cholesterol) which is only created through exercise. Any type of exercise will burn calories which will aide in weight loss and the more you do, the more calories you will burn. Find a sport or activity you enjoy doing and stick with it. Exercise helps in many aspects of the body such as increasing brain capacity, increasing bone density, improve mood and help manage stress,  lower blood pressure, and can help with many diseases and disorders.   Fitness is not a ""goal"", it is a journey and you have to stick with it to see progress.   As far as nutrition goes, I personally believe that sugar is the real enemy, and while small amounts of sugar can help mental health at the time of consumption, overdoing it will only hurt you. Lower the amount of sugar and carbs (which inevitably turn to sugar) and increase the amount of vegetables and protein. However, every body is different and you might have to try different things to see which work. I am not a fan, however, of the ""shakeology"" diets which give you a shake to drink which will give you all the nutrients and calories needed. It is true that the brain does not process liquid calories to make you feel more full, which is why drinks such as sodas don't make you any more full but just give you calories. Therefore, drinking shakes may have the same effect on the body and you won't be any more full than you were before. However, these shakes do work for some people as long as they change their diet and exercise patterns along with it.  Again there is no ""easy way out"" it takes hard work and determination but every single person is possible of living a healthy lifestyle.  I am not an expert, however I did get my degree in Exercise and Sport Science and have recently dedicated my life to health.

From my research, essentially to gain muscle, you need at a caloric surplus and lift to (almost) failure. Whether that be 5 reps or 10 reps, you will gain muscle as long as you lift to near-failure. To lose weight, eat at a caloric deficit. In terms of protein, I have always heard that if you are trying to gain muscle, one gram of protein per pound of bodyweight, but honestly that is probably rubbish too.   To sum up, unfortunately the science is inconclusive in terms of what is best. The known thing it that if you eat more calories than you burn, and you lift heavy weights (again, close to failure), then you will gain muscle and fat. If you eat less calories than you burn (either with added exercise or just eating less), then you will lose weight."

I've experienced extreme and unjustified jealousy as well as codependency. The good new is, there are a lot of ways to recognize this type of thinking in your relationships to make positive changes in your life!   Firstly, feelings of jealousy and codependence stem from a lack of self confidence, self-esteem, and self-worth. You can take steps to change your thoughts and habits to create self-worth, which will lead to feeling more secure in relationships.  Your first step is informing yourself. Google questions like ""how to overcome jealousy"" and ""how to build self worth."" You will find out exactly what tendencies you have that contribute to the negative behaviors you are experiencing, and you will learn what changes need to be made.  Also, dedicate more time to improving yourself in physical and mental ways. I subscribe to Brian Johnson's daily emails. He has 10 min videos each morning about self improvement. Do whatever you need to do to learn more about what is leading to your behavior, and make the effort to change those tendencies to reach happiness! Good luck"

IWantToLearn,3b8w27,RadioHitandRun,7,Sat Jun 27 03:28:18 2015 UTC,"I've been there, and recently switched things up to fix it.   We've been married for 21 years, together for 26, and a year ago we were ready to call it quits and divorce. Fighting was a regular occurrence, almost a need for both of us. We'd rubber band between happy and angry on a cycle so predictable that i finally decided to do something about it. With the blessing of our counselors (Yes, plural, one for me, one for her, and one for us...) I 'split' with her. Which is to say that I called a 'time out' on our relationship and moved to the other end of the house.   The adjustment period was rough for us, but for me, it was a weight off my shoulders. (I actually burst out laughing in the middle of the day for no damn reason because I finally felt the lightness coming back to me.) She took longer to accept it, but with the guidance of our joint counselor, we started communicating for quality, not volume. In her words, we 'disentangled' ourselves.   While this was going on, she began getting much needed help for her past issues from 'her' counselor, and I began working on healthy behavior habits with mine. This led me to find ideals in Stoicism, Buddhism, mindfulness, and meditation that rung with me. The further I get into these concepts, the more I find that I am my own person, and that my focus was so tiny and encompassed by 'our' world, that I wasn't seeing 'my' world.  Now, I realize that you're asking about relationships that you may not have started yet, but here's a few things I've taken away from this that may help you:   You can become completely entangled with someone even with high confidence levels. I am quite secure about myself and abilities, have not found too many things that I probably wouldn't be able to grasp with a few tries. Despite this, it just snuck on us/me, and I can see the possibility of having it happen again. But now that I'm aware of it, I am keeping an eye out for it. Following Buddhism and Stoicism, nothing is permanent. Nothing. While oversimplifying, it stands that you will be much happier if you accept this. People will do things that you have no control over, shattering your beliefs about that person. Understanding that nothing is forever will help ease, or even remove, the blow when it happens. You are NOT responsible for another person's happiness. You can volunteer for the job, but you can quit at any time as well. Particularly if they aren't willing to help.  Most people aren't in touch with how they really feel. Does being clingy to your partner REALLY make you happy, or does it give you some other emotion? Most of our behaviors with partners is habit, and they carry on even after it stops feeling good. Learn to recognize this, learn to recognize your feelings. You are the ONLY person you can 100% rely on for looking out for YOUR feelings, stop ignoring them.  Nobody sees things through the same lens. Your view, coupled with your experiences, beliefs, and biases will ensure that you are the only one who sees things in your exact way. Accepting this and turning it around allows for a much easier time in understanding why people sometimes act like they do. Which is to say that in most cases, people didn't truly mean to hurt/offend you, they simply saw it through a different lens.   I realize that some of these points are more 'self help' than anything, but it's about you being independent. Using these points has helped me remain unentangled with my wife, and for our relationship to begin to grow again in a much healthier way."

Needs are so heavy and that puts stress on other person. You need to eat. You need to breathe. You WANT to be with them. Want is something you desire or crave. See the difference? 2. Don't be jealous- here's how... It the other person cheats on you, it really has nothing to do with you! Supermodels get cheated on. Why? Because the other person saw an opportunity and took it. I really don't think your SO is thinking of ways to hurt you on purpose. 3. Get a life. Not a couple life. A life of your own. Join a gym, take up painting, learn to cook. Something that occupies your free time. Then when you are busy and find free time to see SO, it's a treat (see #1). Staying busy makes special times more special. Good luck! Hope I helped."

IWantToLearn,3b8w27,C_Jay,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:27:29 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend the book Intimate Connections by David Burns. This book helped me tremendously (as well as his amazing book Feeling Good, which addresses self-esteem and depression issues, including addiction to approval and love.)  Basically, you need to become more comfortable with who you are and be completely ok with being alone. This is, for some, including me, difficult at times. As others suggested, exercise, eat well, and spend some alone time doing things just for yourself. Watch a movie alone, go on a hike through a local park alone, meditate, get some new clothes, and learn to enjoy yourself.  Also, I recommend taking a good hard look at your core values. What do you truly find to be your ultimate values that define who you want to be and what kind of integrity you have. What is important to you, regardless of outside influences. Honesty? Humor? Open-mindedness? Success? And then ask why you believe so strongly in those things. Were you raised to believe them? Did you read about them? Does your religion or lack thereof influence you? Do you believe things just to please your parents or possibly some authority figure? How long as it been since you taken a good look at your beliefs and assumptions about yourself and the world? These questions will help define yourself, and when you start to figure out who you are and are proud of yourself, you will stop relying so heavily on others to provide your sense of self-esteem because you will start to truly feel that you are a good person. This knowledge of yourself will also help define boundaries and start to filter out toxic people in your life. All of this will further enhance your relationships with others.  I found very quickly that a lot of my insecurities and codependent tendencies stem from completely irrational thought patterns that I have as habits. You have to break these habits of thinking and begin to think more rationally. This, contrary to what I used to believe, will actually HELP get more in touch with your emotions. Jealousy, anger, and poor self-esteem often come from having distorted thoughts. Correct the thoughts and those issues will start to diminish.  Oh and I'm a big book guy so I'll also recommend The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem which is a beast on the subject and pretty much every sentence in it is, in my opinion, gold. Good luck!"
IWantToLearn,3b8w27,muNICU,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:46:02 2015 UTC,"I learned this the hard way by being in way too many ""serious"" relationships in a row.  What helps is, while you're single and appreciating all that ""freedom,"" think hard and unforgivingly about why you didn't feel ""free"" to do/feel/think these same things when you were with someone.  It's probably because of myths you hold on to when you're in a relationship - myths like you somehow own one another, that you are in debt to each other, and that you require each other to do or be something.  The truth is that these are bad attitudes for a lot of people, and reality can be much more simple. You both want human companionship and love. Romantic/sexual love is, in most cultures, a simultaneously voluntary and compulsive form of that. The rest is what you make of it. It feels weird at first but you don't have to follow the usual script in your relationship with someone, e.g. talking every day, when to have a given kind of sex, and joining your families.

But from my observations of my friends and just people around me is that it has a lot to do with society.  In high school we are exposed to ""teen media"" showing relationships with glamours girls and impeccable boys. They seems so happy and shit. And even the people around us in high school. The better looking boys are always with some cute scene girl, and they're always so lovey-dovey. They stand out, and it's what we pay attention to.   But in reality, most teens are not so conformist. The majority does not have many girls or guys interested in them. We sit at home playing video games, browsing /r/ragecomics. We don't have a lot of friends or activities outside of the house. But we compare ourselves to the ""popular"" kids, and think less of ourselves because we are not them.   So when someone finally shows interest in us, we are so hungry for the relationship experience, that we become completely obsessed with exhilarating experience of a relationship that it drives people away. And of course we are bound to do it over and over. And abandonment issues can also be a huge contributor.

So you're constantly reflecting on this person, right? Well memories are highly context dependent. So you change the context around a bit. Change little things, like your phone and computer background, ringtone, maybe rearrange some things in your house. The example here is that when you check your phone, you usually expect a message from this person because of the context and what you're used to seeing. So changing that around alters your expectations and stop reminding you of that person. This creates a new context for you to make memories with. If you're following a routine, try to mix it up a bit. The idea is to not do the exact same things you were doing while you were with that person, because then the memories will still be there, and you will only be reminded of that person while you're doing those things. You need to do things that won't cause you to think of that person, and you also need to change things around a bit so that everything doesn't remind you of that person."

I've received a surprisingly amount of compliments for my voice from strangers in the past. I won't humble brag on that much, but my family/close friends constantly teases me on the way I talk. I often get talked over, or ignored because it takes me to long to say what I'm trying to say lol  I even tried to speed up my voice by practicing tongue twisters, like ""red leather, yellow leather"" and ""toy boat."" And was pretty good at them. I was stupid and tried to argue this and one of my sisters burst out laughing saying the only reason why I was good at it was because I talked so slow!  Anyway, what I guess I'm trying to say is that this type of voice does command respect- but not in everyday conversation. Like OP said, he/she likes her boss's voice, but it's because OP has to listen to them. In everyday conversation it doesn't really work out  I'm not arguing with you, just venting I guess haha.

IWantToLearn,3b2kig,mysteryvictory,56,Thu Jun 25 13:31:43 2015 UTC,"I copied this from somewhere, but these are the principles for teaching adults:  The five main principles of Andragogy have now been recognized as fundamental to all effective learning, from kindergarten through graduate school.   Adults need to know the reason for learning something.  Experience (including error) provides the basis for learning activities.  Adults need to be responsible for their decisions on education; involvement in the planning and evaluation of their instruction. Adults are most interested in learning subjects having immediate relevance to their work and/or personal lives.  Adult learning is problem-centered rather than content-oriented.    So my advice would be to ask him if there's anything he wants to learn how to do specifically. If he doesn't have anything in mind, offer him a few suggestions like use Facebook or skype, how to google for information, how to send an email, etc. Then, teach only the steps necessary to achieve that goal. I know there's a lot of tips and tricks that you know, but it'll bog down the lesson and get confusing and overwhelming. For example, keyboard shortcuts are awesome at saving time, but don't interrupt him if he is using the right mouse button to copy something. You can show him all the time-saving shortcuts at another lesson specifically with that as the objective.  Like Beerifucus says, have them do everything. Hands-on helps with learning. It also helps to have him write down the steps as you are instructing him. This reinforces learning and creates an artifact to use as a reference for when he practices on his own."
IWantToLearn,3b2kig,QoQers,14,Thu Jun 25 16:19:02 2015 UTC,"Technology Trainer for adults here. These ideas listed above are all key.   The main thing is to have goal-oriented sessions versus ""let me show you what ALL of these buttons do."" Want to learn the Internet? Teach him to how to search for his own things on Google. No need to get into the history of the Internet or what every button does on a browser (just yet). Stick the minimum number of steps to reach simple goals. Interested in what Facebook is? Teach him how to add 5 friends, send them messages, and view other profiles. Don't teach him all of the different menus (just yet).   Hands-on is VERY important. You should not need to touch the mouse or keyboard at all for him. As the reply stated above, he needs to make the mistakes himself. Take breaks and constantly check whether or not he has questions.  TL;DR: Stick to simple goals that he wants to achieve, let him do the driving."
IWantToLearn,3b2kig,photorialist,4,Thu Jun 25 19:08:49 2015 UTC,"Adults need to know the reason for learning something.   I just wanted to say that this is SO important. Maybe you can identify a pain point in your father's life, show him how the internet can make it easier, and then teach him how to do it.  Even things that seem basic to you may need to be explained in this way. The first time my mom went to Google, she said ""I don't know what to type in the box,"" not realizing that people don't just go to Google and try to think up a question. In the same way, new computer users need to understand they're not just using the computer for its own sake - it's more to facilitate some kind of pre-existing, real-life need."
IWantToLearn,3b2kig,hmakein,10,Thu Jun 25 23:41:19 2015 UTC,"I've taught a few family members, but this by no means makes me an expert computer first timer educator....  One thing I have noticed that does work really well for helping them remember where icons/menus are is to ALWAYS have them driving when you're teaching something. If you're working towards making a desktop shortcut to something, have THEM do it. If you are clicking around (most likely 10x the speed they can actually consume) then they won't really pick it up.  Also, YOU should try & use the computer like they intend to. Go look for a picture of something (say a Cat!?), then figure out how to download it, also where it was sent to, and then how you can make that your desktop (or whatever... email it to friend, etc.).  I was ultimately not able to really get my 90+ year old grandfather to work it out on his own, but both my parents in their 60's have no issues now. I'd even go as far as saying they are completely self sufficient after a few years & few sessions of explaining (and of course a dozen phone calls...).  Can't stress enough though, don't just go whizzing through menus. Make them sit there and do it all, even if it's something 'beyond' their needs (like control panel settings, etc.). Just explain, be patient & let them figure it out. Through this, my Mom ended up using left hand mouse even though she's right handed. I would have never thought to move it or even try other side... she got annoyed after a while trying to drive around herself while I was teaching stuff & moved to other side. They will figure out nuances like that."
IWantToLearn,3b2kig,Beerificus,8,Thu Jun 25 15:49:10 2015 UTC,"Number one thing BE PATIENT! This is like learning a whole new language. It will be slow.  I only gave recommendations for teaching my Grandad computers (no way was I going to become 'tech support'), but some of the things we did:  *Label all parts of the computer - monitor, tower, power button, mouse, router. Helps with over the phone instructions.  *Clear all programs off the desktop/task bar except those he was going to use - Internet (renamed to 'internet', not Chrome or Firefox), word, my documents.  *Print out screenshots for desktop and programs. So when we say click start on the desktop, he can look at his picture of the desktop and find the right button.  *Written instructions (with pictures) on how to properly shutdown/restart computer. Usually he leaves it on, but knows he must do it occasionally.   *We basically wrote a mini manual for common tasks. It is important that you go through it with him, we changed a few words, added instructions, rewrote sections as he went through (also in here was a list of OS, computer make/model, program names in case he has to call real tech support).  For usage, start with Internet. Let him open the browser, control the mouse, type - be patient!  My grandad's first foray into the Internet...  This is called the address bar - point to address bar (pictures in manual).   You can use it to go straight to a page, if you know its address, or search for a new page. Let's try looking for info about the Flying Scotsman (he loves trains). So use your mouse to click on the bar. Now type in 'flying scotsman' and either click here - point - or press enter, this button - point.  Okay, so we have a list of pages that mention the train. If you want pictures only, click here - point - but I want to know when it was built. So reading the descriptions, which one would be best to find that information. The ones near the top of the list are usually better. Goes to wikipedia  That's a good page. If you know you want to come back to this page, we can bookmark it by clicking here - point. It's like making an address book, you can save as many as you want, but if you have too many you struggle to find that one phone number you need, so don't go bookmarking everything.   Okay, now you try to find information about the QE2 (he likes ships too). sit back and watch, only interfere if he asks for help. If he makes a mistake, wait until he realises then show him how to fix it  Don't overwhelm him with jargon, or tasks. Keep words simple. Use pictures. Focus on one thing at a time. After searching and bookmarking, we moved on to email. Then downloading/saving pictures. This took many, many weeks."
IWantToLearn,3b2kig,Vctrlysn,4,Thu Jun 25 17:31:13 2015 UTC,"My 70-something year old mother is far more savvy than any of her peers and she credits me for her success. I've also trained a lot of her (senior citizen) friends on computers with similar success. I've been setting up and mentoring my mother in computers for more than 20 years and here's a few things I've learned.   Your dad should have the same basic setup as you. If you're on a Mac, Dad should be on a Mac. If you're on Windows 7 Pro, Dad should be on Windows 7 Pro. If you've got a laptop, Dad should have a laptop. This will make things far easier to troubleshoot and guide through in the future. Install/activate a remote desktop service on Dad's computer and have the appropriate client on your computer, and make sure you can remotely access Dad's computer without him needing to do anything. You can do this on the cheap by using a free dynamic DNS service (with an appropriate DNS updater service on Dad's computer) and VNC software, or you can do more elaborate things with services like join.me. Set up Dad's computer so that he has to maintain as little as possible. Enable automatic updates, for example, and install whatever software he may need — even if you're not going to teach him that thing just yet (see below). So you'll generally want to install things like Java RE, Flash Player, antivirus software, and things of that nature. Make the desktop Dad-friendly. Remove everything from the desktop, task bar, dock, etc except for what he absolutely needs to know. On a Windows 7 system that's typically Computer, My Documents, and Recycle Bin on the desktop, plus whatever app(s) he's using on the taskbar. On a Mac that's typically Macintosh HD on the desktop, plus Finder, Trash, and whatever app(s) he's using in the dock. Focus on one thing at a time. Decide what single thing you want Dad to know about and don't stray from that. If you're teaching him email, then put the email client app in his taskbar/dock and that's it. If you're teaching him Word, then put that icon in his taskbar/dock. The only icons in his taskbar/dock should be apps that he either already knows how to use, or is in the process of learning.   Once you've got that all set up, what you need to do is teach him something he'd actually be interested in learning. There's no sense in, for example, teaching him Microsoft Word if he writes two letters a year. For my mother, that first thing was Quicken. I watched her manually reconcile her checkbook every month, taking an hour or more to do it. I set her up with Quicken and presented it as a challenge; I told her to use it for a month just as a check register, in addition to using her traditional register, and at the end of the month we'd reconcile. When she got her statement we went through her physical register and reconciled which took about 45 minutes. We then reconciled with Quicken which took about three minutes. After about 10 minutes of her double-checking Quicken's figures, she was hooked. The following month was the last month she used a physical register; after that it was entirely Quicken.  I had similar experiences with her and email, web browsing, using iTunes, using iPhoto, video conferencing, scanning, home inventory, and more. We focused on single activities that could save her time and/or improve her organization. Some things (like social media) didn't stick; she wasn't interested in it so I dropped it. Other things (like casual gaming) stuck with the fury of a gallon of Crazy Glue so I encouraged it."

Honestly, I used this over and over, 100% success rate. A lot of the issues come from feeling embarrassed over the basic mechanics of using a mouse, and this got people over that hump.

Teach him, and tell him that he himself should write notes if he wants to.  That said, of course at first you'll have to teach a few things without terribly helpful examples - how to turn the computer on/off, what's a window, what's a file, what's an internet address. If that's explained right at the beginning, people usually understand this easily. The metaphors for it are nice.  But afterwards it's quite simple with examples. I taught my 72 year old neighbour to use computers with that method. As an example I'll take something non-techy: Screwdrivers. How many people explain how to do things on a computer is like this: ""place this thing here, place this other thing behind it so it matches, then rotate this other thing. Then the piece of wood will stick to the other piece of wood. Magically.""   But this is horrible. A much better approach is: ""Well, to put these two pieces together you need a screw and a screwdriver. The screw is spiralled, so when you rotate it, it cuts the wood and pulls itself in, tacking both pieces of wood together. And you need the screwdriver to rotate the screw."" Guess what? This person will know what he's doing, but not only that, if this person ever sees a drilling machine, he'll practically immediately know what it is used for and how it does what it does.  EDIT: Also, teach him not to be afraid. Teach him that whatever he does with the machine software-wise is easily fixable."

IWantToLearn,3b4jv6,vivianvn,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:53:39 2015 UTC,"Not sure how well these options work in Canada, but here are some things you could consider:   tutoring (both private and online) - If you have decent people skills and any sort of specialized knowledge people are willing to pay for, you have the potential to be a tutor. Math is always a popular, in-demand subject people need help with, but there is also programming, foreign language, writing, and musical instruments. Private tutoring gives you the most control (especially over your pay rate), but it also means you need to dedicate a fair amount of time to finding clients. Online tutoring has the benefit that someone else handles the marketing aspect, but you usually make less per hour. A good online tutoring site that you can utilize as a Canadian is tutor.com if you are curious about online tutoring. online poker - A hard way to make an easy living is what they say about it. Although it seems simple, playing poker for money actually requires a lot more patience and finesse that a lot of people are capable of. There are a lot of great books that can get you started (Winning Low-Limit Hold Em, Theory of Poker, Harrington on Hold Em, etc.) Luckily you're in Canada, so the Black Friday stuff from four years ago shouldn't affect you as much. People who play professionally usually use software called heads-up display to improve their games, but if you're just looking for side income it's not that necessary, although it still may be a good tool. Check out the FAQ at /r/poker for more info on this whole path. blogging - There is an overwhelming amount of information online on how to go about setting up and monetizing a blog, but the gist of it is choose a topic or niche that interests you, write quality content on a regular basis, attract traffic to your blog, and then either make your own products/services to sell (like courses, books, workshops, etc.) or create revenue through ads and affiliate marketing (I personally recommend the former). Common platforms for blogging include WordPress, Tumblr, Medium, and Squarespace, but I recommend Ghost or Silvrback if you don't want to spend a lot of time configuring a website. Copyblogger has a lot some free ebooks of specific topics that are helpful for blogging, but it's not too hard to just learn as you go, especially if this is just a side thing for you.  crafting - If you want a more tangible way to earn some money, learn how to knit/crochet/cross-stitch/sew and sell your items online. The fabric crafts in particular have a very low start-up cost (which fits in with your tight budget) and once you know what you're doing, knitting/crocheting/etc is something you can do while watching TV, commuting on the bus/train, listening to music, etc. Etsy is a good place to set up shop so customers are able to find you, and as long as your product quality and output is good, you should make a decent income after a while. Things you can make include clothing, stuffed animals, embroidered items, even framed cross-stitch designs. pet-related - There are tons of options here--grooming, walking, sitting/boarding, training--so if you're into animals, this is a pretty good way to make some side money. Sitting is especially easy as long as you're comfortable being alone in other people's houses with their pets, but you basically just sit around and give someone else's pet attention for pay--what more can you ask for? Better yet, you can specialize in certain breeds or animals; people with unusual pets like ferrets, rabbits, gerbils, and the like usually feel a lot better leaving their pet with someone who knows a lot about that specific animal. Grooming has a higher learning curve of course, but is probably the most lucrative option since it is more labor-intensive, and you might be able to get hired in an actual position somewhere if you can groom dogs.   Just some ideas to get you started; tried to focus on stuff that is both cheap and accessible."

In soccer you get: 3 points for a win 1 for a tie 0 for a loss If at the end some teams have the same amount of points they resort to ""Goal Difference"" which is the amount of goals scored - goals conceded.  As for the leagues, almost every country has a league but the most known and the ""best"" are the top five European leagues (English - Barclays Premier League, German - Bundesliga, French - Ligue 1, Italian - Serie A, Spanish - La Liga or Liga BBVA)  There is no real ""best player"" but there is a player of the season award held annually called the "" FIFA Ballon d'Or "" and it's been mostly dominated by Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.  Lionel Messi is an Argentinian forward who plays for FC Barcelona, he just turned 28. Cristiano Ronaldo is a Portugese winger who plays for Real Madrid, he's 30 years old. It's a toss up between them as to who the best player is, I personally prefer Messi.

One thing one of my humanities professors told me was that often students will cram an essay in one or two days. They'll start with what they think their thesis is, write a full essay--whether it's good or not, we're not sure--and end with a strong conclusion. He recommends you take that conclusion, and restart your essay with that as your thesis. Essentially, it takes a lot of time to do revisions, to really understand what you are trying to say. Your brain needs time to process, so don't expect essays to be perfect in a day or two. Give yourself about 2 hours each day for a couple of weeks to work on it."

Writers like Malcolm Gladwell have blogs where they routinely post essays. Those would be worth a read. There are essay contests all over the place that will show you award winning essays. Each one of your essays will be distinct from other essays. So much of it is contextual that you will just have to do a lot of trial and error before you will be satisfied.   Unleash your inquisitive self. Find otherwise boring topics and try to write an interesting essay about them. Could you write an essay about grocery stores? What would that entail? Is it a window into the globalized world with products touched by millions of hands? Is there a more interesting way to consider the topic?  Try your best to make the experience enjoyable and you'll perform. Best of luck

IWantToLearn,3b31rc,firesoforion,2,Thu Jun 25 19:47:22 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a great start! High school is supposed to help you start thinking concretely about these things, but that's why you're going to college, to get better at writing!  Also, reading helps a LOT. Just learning new vocabulary and sentence structure. Read articles on Grantland, The New Yorker, The Wall Street Journal, any other news items you like. Read the opinion letters. Those are essays. Read blog posts. Go over to Medium.com and make an account, read through people's writing and start writing your own.  Writing is probably one of the hardest skills to acquire, so don't beat yourself up over it. Yes, it is ok to start with cookie cutter, that's what they're there for! :) It's a base. Utilize the tutoring resources you have on campus. It's totally ok to go in and say ""I just need another set of eyes on my essay so I can improve.""  As you progress, you will see that writing will take on many molds. Your intro might need a couple paragraphs, as long as you make your point early. Some of the points in your body paragraph will need 2-3 paragraphs to show your data and analysis. Sometimes you won't only have one piece of data to back up your point.  What classes will you be taking next? Are you still taking English classes? Usually in college they are set up like workshops so that you can do peer edits and work in class."

Yeah I think writing is a really difficult skill to pick up but I am heavily foreseeing that in the future, I will have to heavily rely upon it to have success in my field. I want to be able to develop it now while I still have leisure time rather than play catch-up 2-3 years down the line.   I will indeed use the resources on campus to further my writing skills. The resources that you've mentioned that I should read are incredible and I will definitely do my best to frequent them more often. I am very grateful that you've given me a place to start .^  I won't be taking an ""English"" class per say in the upcoming year but I will be taking a pseudo sociology/health awareness course that I am aware does have an essay assignment down the line associated with it.

My lack of confidence in essay writing basically led me to choose a program completely devoid of any sort of subjective writing (the most I'd do would be analysis of data collected in a lab) but now I realize that essay writing is something I will need when I am applying to medical schools and graduate schools/programs.

IWantToLearn,3b31rc,ChrisGuenther,3,Fri Jun 26 21:53:18 2015 UTC,"Basically, use the standard outline (slightly more detailed) as a plug-and-play guide to exactly what needs to go where in your essay.  Don't put anything more, don't put anything less.  Substantiate everything, cite and use quotes.  Varying your sentence length and structure will go a long way to ensuring you have good style.  Before you start anything, come up with your ""research question,"" the answer to which will be your thesis.  It will take a little practice to come up with research questions with just the right scope.  After you've read a bit about your topic (honestly, you can even just skim through sources until you find information directly related to your question), decide on a thesis.  This is the most important part of any essay.  A good thesis won't ensure you a good essay, but a bad thesis WILL ensure you a bad one.      Then just follow this outline for each of your sections.  Introduction  (about one page)      Start with a hook (something to draw your readers in).      Set the stage with a description of the background of your problem      Write your thesis.      Summarize your major supporting points (You should have 3-5 of these).    Body (Go through your points one by one with this format)      Topic sentence - Start the paragraph/section with one sentence which explains exactly what your point is and how it relates to your thesis.      Your proof - Put all the supporting material from your reading, facts, dates, quotes, whatever. Acknowledge opposing points but this is where your hardcore convincing comes in. This should go without saying, but don't ever put personal anecdotes or anything like that.    Conclusion (I usually went for about half a page, but that's just an estimate)      2-3 sentences recapping your thesis and supporting points.      Questions your research raises, things you wonder about, suggestions for future research, basically anything you've speculated about while you were actually doing the research.  If you follow this format even remotely well, you should get decent grades on essays.  If you internalize this format, you should get to the point where you can write good essays quickly.  I used to write A essays (and those which professors specifically mentioned enjoying reading) in about 6 hours in college.    Then of course you want to make sure to have decent style.  Stay in the active voice, add about one quote per supporting point, use some short sentences and some long ones.  If grammar is an issue for you, practice it."
IWantToLearn,3b31rc,sarautu,2,Thu Jun 25 19:11:28 2015 UTC,"Also, a couple pieces of advice from professors I really liked:    If you have a point which is weaker than the others, put it in the middle where it's less noticeable.    Make sure the beginning of your essay (introduction and first point at least) are strong.  If you make a good first impression, that'll carry you through mediocre writing later on.  If your beginning is weaker and you're having to prove yourself after a professor has already decided the essay is mediocre, it will be much harder to get a good grade (or for that matter, impress anyone reading your essay).    Always use good grammar and spelling.  Your essay is fundamentally an argument.  You are trying to convince people your thesis is true.  It will be much harder to convince people if they're judging your grammar.    Also, and this is just from me, always use a cover sheet.  It doesn't matter if your professor requires it or not. It just looks better, makes it look like you take the assignment more seriously, and (again) makes a better first impression.  I know it's sort of a waste of paper, but it's only one sheet and it makes all the difference in the world.   ETA: My advice sounds like I'm trying to help people take the easy way out, be lazy, or rush through their work.  I'm actually not, and in fact I'm a professional writer now.  That said, if you focus on keeping your essay format and writing fairly standard (these outlines are standard for a reason), you can focus on having more fun with the content.  You can play with theses in amazing ways, but that's where the fun is, not format."

I pick question sets of various concepts I have a tough time learning, and if I look at a problem and hesitate for just a moment on the process of finding the answer, I do it. I keep doing similar problems until I look at a new question, and there is no more hesitation. When I can glance at a question and I know exactly what formula or algorithm is required (and in my early calculus days, what types of differentiation or integration) while possibly identify potential issues within that problem, I know I am 'proficient' in that specific concept.   Until the exam date, I'll still throw a few of those problems in my homework question sets, however I will no longer get that 'Wait wait I think I know this...' doubt that I simply hate. Those slight hesitations are confidence killers. The first few times it may occur during an exam you can usually brush them off, but if you're experiencing those with every problem, it becomes taxing. Don't forget to eat right and exercise.

The vast majority of the time, they're just good, old-fashioned anxiety and don't actually make sense to anyone but your lizard brain.  Dealing with social anxiety is a particularly huge topic of discussion, and everyone has their own method of doing so. I recently heard a mantra from a comedian on a podcast that helped me with my social anxiety. She had worked with someone who specifically requested to not work with her on a later project. She wasn't given any reasons why. This happens pretty often in the entertainment industry, so she needed to learn how to deal with the fact that some people just aren't going to like her. So one day, it occurred to her that, ""It's really none of my business what other people think about me."" People have the right to think and feel whatever they want. If it just so happens that they think you're wrong or that you might be an asshole, then fine; they're entitled to that. If someone gives you explicit, good reasons why you might be wrong/an asshole, address them yourself, adjust, and move on; but, if you get the vague sense that someone is thinking about you negatively or even a vague confirmation, and that gives you anxiety, remember that that's completely within their prerogative. Don't make assumptions about things you can't know. Just accept it.  It's cheesy, but the trick really is just to be yourself. The advanced trick is learning how to stop irrationally obsessing over other people's opinions on ""yourself."" You're not a politician: You're a real, complex person. You'll probably never fully understand you, and nearly all of the people you meet will never come close to getting you either. Be nice and treat everyone--including yourself--like autonomous and welcome people, and people will respect you're autonomy and be more welcoming. If they don't return your respect, they are being an asshole, and its time to move on."
