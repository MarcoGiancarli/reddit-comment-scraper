Latency is typically measured in milliseconds. The lower the latency (the fewer the milliseconds), the better the network performance.  FierceWireless, with partner OpenSignal, is hoping to shed some light onto the latency issue.  Below you'll find charts showing exactly how the carriers stacked up against each other in the second quarter across their different network technologies, from LTE to EV-DO Rev. A to eHRPD (a software solution that allows Verizon and Sprint to use existing CDMA towers to pass data packets over to the LTE network) to HSPAP (part of the HSPA upgrade path) to HSPA. You'll also find the raw data collected by OpenSignal that the charts are based on.  In the below charts, AT&T showed a slight increase in latency speeds on its LTE network in the second quarter, when compared with the operator's results from the first quarter. Sprint too showed an increase in its 3G latency speeds during that period. Overall, Sprint showed some of the lowest latency figures in the second quarter when compared with its rivals.  Click here for OpenSignal's latency report for the first quarter, and here for a report from last year.  OpenSignal uses a panel of more than 1 million consumer devices to provide real world data on the performance and coverage of mobile networks.

Good news is while the glass slowly started to chip away, it was mostly at the top of the home button so I never cut my self on it.

Sprint,3dwqte,payturrpurandoh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:21:03 2015 UTC,How about an iPhone 5? Is there any difference or is it the same situation as the 4S?
Sprint,3dwqte,blaziecat1103,2,Mon Jul 20 21:34:23 2015 UTC,"Some Verizon iPhone 5 units that were issued as AppleCare replacements sneaked into the Sprint whitelist, and have a chance of working on Sprint. I make no guarantees. See this post on the subreddit for Ting, which piggybacks on the Sprint network.  This loophole could have been closed, though."
Sprint,3dwqte,blaziecat1103,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:41:39 2015 UTC,"Cool - thanks again. I just got off Sprint chat and they told me a Verizon iphone 5 would work for sure because ""both carriers use the same network"" which should be right except Sprint doesn't work that way from what I gather. I guess I'll just have to get my hands on one and find out."
Sprint,3dwqte,blaziecat1103,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:47:50 2015 UTC,"Oh, I thought you already had one. Don't buy one. Instead, buy a Sprint iPhone 5C if you want a cheap iPhone. Not only is the 5C in general a better phone when it comes to cellular connectivity(more LTE network support, including full support for AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile once unlocked), the Sprint 5C is generally cheaper than the Verizon 5 on the used market."
Sprint,3dwqte,paperbanjo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:04:32 2015 UTC,"Oh, I wouldn't be buying it - I'm trying to find a friend who has one to spare. Thanks for the advice though. I've also been checking Swappa, and it looks like I might be able to get an HTC One for $90, which would be my cheapest option right now if I had to buy a phone."
Sprint,3dwqte,paperbanjo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:28:38 2015 UTC,"For cheap smartphones, check out Swappa's Sprint section. Sprint won't activate a Verizon iPhone 4, even if it's unlocked. It's a bit stupid, but I'm not making the decisions.  I have a sneaking suspicion that when it went into the rice, your M7 had already bitten the dust.   You can put your service that's currently on your M7 on the $9/month Seasonal Suspension plan for a month so that you don't pay for service you're not using while you sort out a new phone. You'll have to call customer service to get that plan on your account. What Seasonal Suspension will do is freeze everything about the line it's on in carbonite. Beware, though, that it pushes back your upgrade date because of it suspending your contract as well."
Sprint,3dwqte,porksandwich9113,2,Mon Jul 20 05:35:31 2015 UTC,"I'll need to check when I return to work to confirm or deny this, but I think seasonal standby only extends the contract and does not push the upgrade date back. They are two different things."
Sprint,3dwqte,blaziecat1103,2,Mon Jul 20 06:52:04 2015 UTC,Thanks. I don't mind the contract extension. But I already am qualified for an upgrade by about 6 months. Just didn't want to waste it on an iPhone that will be outdated in a few months. Also any idea if this will work on sero accounts? I said it in my other response but I'm afraid the rep will do something weird to remove sero either by mistake or intentionally.

Your best bet would be to buy a waterproof case for a phone that's not natively waterproof. For example, Lifeproof makes cases for the iPhone 4, 4S, 5, 5C, 5S, 6, and 6 Plus, and the Galaxy S4, S5, and S. For the HTC One M9, there's the first-party ""Active Case."" Incipio makes the Atlas series of cases for the iPhone 5S, 5, and the Galaxy S4. There are more cases for individual phones, and there are also the universal waterproof pouches. The nice ones are actually called universal waterproof cases, and in a pinch, you can always throw a phone in a couple layers of plastic sandwich bags."

The campaign, called ""Competify"" and kicked off with a full-page ad in The New York Times, uses a medical theme to make the point that more competition is needed to offset the ""chronic disease"" that is the ""powerful few"" that ""control our broadband pipelines,"" making them more expensive and slow.  ....  More specifically, the group is hoping to influence the FCC's upcoming competitive access proceeding, in which it will decide whether small carriers should get special access to last-mile resources as they transition their networks to all-IP.

The bill notification will direct you to Sprint Customer Care who can assist in efforts to unlock your device.  For domestic SIM unlockable (""DSU"") devices launched after February 2015, Sprint will automatically unlock the device when it becomes eligible.  For inactive devices, customers must contact Sprint Customer Care to request that their DSU-capable device be unlocked and may have to take steps to perform an over-the-air update to ensure the unlock programming has been relayed to the device.

For T-Mobile/att, there is volte fallback to 3G(though its still buggy)  Given Sprint's spotty patchwork of LTE, its not ready yet (even for beta testers). Wait till Sprint fills in holes in their LTE coverage  Without volte, you can't get simultaneous voice+data in sprint spark(technical limitations), unless you use something like Skype/hangouts(true VoIP services that work directly over data )"
Sprint,3dny1f,pwastage,2,Fri Jul 17 21:10:38 2015 UTC,"In short, Sprint is not planning for VoLTE in the near term. Sprint needs to complete its buildout of 800MHz LTE (Band 26) at the very least and they've said they'll finish by the end of 2015 in areas where rebanding is complete. However, there's more to do after that to ensure the network is robust enough for quality service.  Sprint's Wi-Fi Calling feature is available on iOS and Android devices... Except for Nexus devices.  Sprint Spark is the combination of Band 25/26/41 on supported devices.  You have a Spark device.  Band 41 will provide the speeds you're talking about, especially with 2x20MHz Carrier Aggregation on Band 41. However, your device does not support 2x20MHz Carrier Aggregation on Band 41."

Sprint,3dny1f,sparkedman,3,Mon Jul 20 00:19:37 2015 UTC,"T-Mobile's implementation of Wi-Fi Calling is different than Sprint's. Must be something about it in particular which makes it compatible with the Nexus 6.   Android dev here (maintainer of CM on nexus 9). T-Mobile uses a tech called IMS. IMS is a standard that was opensourced some time back, but was just recently added into Android (5.1 r5 iirc). Sprint uses this technology, however, a modified version of it. T-Mobile basically uses a vanilla IMS core that is authenticated with the SIM. Sprint authenticates with the device identity on the network.  For this reason, no amount of hacking could ever get wifi calling since sprint doesnt have the option enabled on your account.  This is not to say that it will never happen though. If sprint works with Moto on this issue, they could get some changes with IMS merged in to AOSP (android's source code) to allow for this. Its just highly unlikely. Sprint zone also uses some device identity and framework obtained information. It also updates itself without google play. For those two reasons, it is not in the play store. It is possible, however, that one day they put this into the play store. By blocking carriers from modifying the frameworks of the rom obtrusively, Sprint was basically locked out from wifi calling and sprint zone.  Now, VoLTE... That seems to be a protocol problem.

Sprint,3dny1f,sparkedman,0,Mon Jul 20 00:39:59 2015 UTC,Wow. Pretty interesting read! Thanks!  Is the implementation of Wi-Fi Calling on iOS substantially different from Android?

Sprint,3dny1f,graesen,2,Mon Jul 20 01:24:37 2015 UTC,"I have no idea how it's different except that it works. Android is open source, I can see exactly what is done. Apple is totally closed source.   As for the app, Apple will allow a bit more than Google will. Not from devs but from carriers. I assume the biggest issue is the auto updates that occur. Google play STRICTLY prohibits any app that does not update through the play store."

Sprint runs three bands of LTE: 25/26/41 If your market has Spark, Sprint is referring to it having band 41; that is the band that gives the high capacity/high speeds. Band 25 is their general LTE coverage (nationwide PCS spectrum--5x5mhz). Band 26 is their nationwide SMR license--former Nextel spectrum occupying the 800mhz frequency). This is the band that gives extended range and better indoor propagation--also 5x5mhz. Band 41 is 20mhz TDD-LTE, and they have up to 120mhz nationwide spectrum holdings.

Sprint,3djlna,sparkedman,2,Thu Jul 16 22:14:22 2015 UTC,It's an Iphone 6 and yes I do have wifi at home. I will definitely look into the Wi-Fi connect router. Thank you for all your help!
Sprint,3djlna,panjadotme,2,Fri Jul 17 01:30:21 2015 UTC,You're welcome. The router is an 802.11ac device and your iPhone 6 is as well. So it may be an upgrade over the router you currently have.
Sprint,3djlna,sparkedman,2,Fri Jul 17 02:53:08 2015 UTC,Location Location Location. I've seen crazy high speeds where I live.  This is why you have a friend come over first who has the carrier you're thinking of switching to.
Sprint,3djlna,panjadotme,3,Fri Jul 17 06:35:52 2015 UTC,Where are you located? Have you followed these steps?   Download the Sprint Zone App. Report the issue in the Sprint Zone App. Update your PRL/Data Profile. Information about your PRL version is available in Settings--> General--> About--> Carrier (Tap line item to cycle through and display PRL version)   Are you updated to iOS 8.4? Also be sure your Carrier is updated to 20.1
Sprint,3djlna,sparkedman,4,Fri Jul 17 00:05:23 2015 UTC,"Sprint Zone?? Isn't that the App that installs all of Sprint bloat-ware? It's usually the first App I disable on my phones. Often you can catch it before it has a chance to install tons of Apps. (At least on Android).  EDIT: I was wrong, Sprint ID is the cruddy bloatware installer."
Sprint,3djlna,tsumeone,7,Thu Jul 16 20:20:44 2015 UTC,"Nah, you are thinking of the Sprint ID thing (which is super annoying - that is the thing that does the whole ""downloading Sprint default configuration"" with the crapware).  Sprint Zone is just for showing your account info and reporting network issues.  It also comes with the ""Sprint Fun and Games"" but that doesn't download or install anything, and can easily be hidden and notifications disabled."
Sprint,3djlna,sparkedman,3,Fri Jul 17 00:03:29 2015 UTC,"Ah, you're right! My bad. Thanks. I'll edit my comment."
Sprint,3djlna,Photojared,2,Fri Jul 17 03:02:40 2015 UTC,"On iOS, Sprint Zone has to be manually downloaded/installed.  The App enables you to report your speed/coverage issues directly to Sprint and to manage your account."
Sprint,3djlna,sparkedman,8,Fri Jul 17 03:25:28 2015 UTC,I hate that we have to tell people to do this to get even semi-decent speeds. That is what turns non-technical people like my mom away from Sprint.
Sprint,3djlna,Photojared,0,Fri Jul 17 00:30:50 2015 UTC,"I hate that we have to tell people to do this to get even semi-decent speeds. That is what turns non-technical people like my mom away from Sprint.   It's a few taps in an App to report a speed/coverage issue. Same as filing a pinpoint report with Tech Support. AT&T has an issue reporting App of its own: ""Mark The Spot""  I had to use it plenty when I was with AT&T previously. No carrier is 100% perfect and each has similar troubleshooting steps."
Sprint,3djlna,dm919,9,Thu Jul 16 20:25:38 2015 UTC,I reported in that app and over the phone for years and no apparent upgrades were made and my speed never changed. T-Mobile however went from edge to LTE in my area within a year or two. I love sprint and they've treated me well but let's not pretend their speed isn't a problem.
Sprint,3djlna,ruben3232,2,Thu Jul 16 20:29:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not pretending. T-Mobile was able to leverage certain in-place features (existing Fiber backhaul) to accelerate its buildout and by not replacing everything at the sites, it also saved time. Sprint did a complete rip and replace of its gear. It's taken years.  Sprint has finally started to get its network in competitive shape. 2x20MHz Carrier Aggregation should have a substantial impact for devices which support it."
Sprint,3djlna,dm919,3,Thu Jul 16 20:35:33 2015 UTC,"The problem with that statement is that b41 still has terrible building penetration just by the nature of it being 2.5/2.6GHz, even with 2, 3, or 50 carriers.  There are many places in my city where I can get 5-6 bars of b41 and will either go down to 1 bar or flip to b25 (or even b26) as soon as I go indoors.  Sprint needs way more lower band spectrum.  b41 is great outdoors but the amount of small cells they will need for adequate indoor coverage is going to be cost prohibitive."
Sprint,3djlna,sparkedman,2,Thu Jul 16 20:42:42 2015 UTC,Agreed. Hopefully Sprint has the backing of SoftBank to go all-in and get a 10x10 swath of 600MHz Spectrum.  SoftBank did sign off on Sprint's Network densification plan. Perhaps it's picking up the cost?  EDIT: spelling

It seems Sprint is really stepping up their network upgrades which is fantastic. To be honest I'm glad they're not going for all that flashy nonsense that T-Mobile is doing - this low key building is much more organic and nicer than anything else. I'm looking forward to what Sprint will do next!
Sprint,3dfjbd,c12w45g5,2,Thu Jul 16 14:58:04 2015 UTC,I'm looking forward to what Sprint will do next!   2x20MHz Carrier Aggregation on Band 41 has gone live.  Sprint is expected to do 3x20MHz Carrier Aggregation in late 2016 as well.  Sprint's RootMetrics scores for 2H 2015 and 1H 2016 are definitely something to look forward to.

Sprint,3dfjbd,mitten_mike,2,Thu Jul 16 16:30:51 2015 UTC,"Sprint doesn't really have congestion issues with B41. They DO have congestion problems with B25 and B26 because there are still people using old phones, and site density is still an issue in some areas. CA doesn't really help with congestion, it increases reliability and average speeds. By the time Sprint rolls out their densification plan, most people will be off B25 and B26, and on B41, just in time to take advantage of more dense B41."
Sprint,3dfjbd,pwastage,2,Thu Jul 16 18:13:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's my point... Band 41 CA is nice, but its more for long term.

Sprint,3dfjbd,mitten_mike,3,Thu Jul 16 18:35:41 2015 UTC,"focusing on long term problem of congestion via CA   again, CA doesn't really help with congestion, carriers are coming from the same tower still, it helps with maintaining a more consistent signal and higher average speeds.  Sprint doesn't HAVE congestion issues with B41, they have site density issues, which can results in congestion of a tower, but congestion itself isn't the underlying problem. congestion of B25 and B26 is a result of site density as well. the problem is density, not congestion. congestion is just a symptom. poor reliability between sites is a bigger problem than congestion.  T-Mobile and Sprint are facing different issues. Site density is a problem with Sprint because they didn't build their network to use 2.5ghz propagation. T-Mobile is facing congestion due to low availability of spectrum, and they plan to solve it with adding density. Nearly the same solution to very different problems. Sprint's problem is more structural, where T-Mobile's is a patch over a bigger problem."
Sprint,3dfjbd,ViceroyFizzlebottom,2,Thu Jul 16 19:20:43 2015 UTC,"They DO have congestion problems with B25 and B26 because there are still people using old phones   My experience in Phoenix is Sprint has issues with tower density. I'm barely on B41 because the towers are spaced so far apart I have to be practically under it before my phone switches.  I probably spend 50% of my time on LTE on any band and 50% on 3G, sometimes only 1x800.  I'm in the suburbs too!  It's way better than it was 1 year ago, but still a far cry my Sprint experiences in other metros."
Sprint,3dfjbd,mitten_mike,2,Thu Jul 16 19:37:04 2015 UTC,"exactly. B26 and B25 are crowded as hell right now because of their site density issues. B41 sites are too far apart = people are constantly on B26 or B25 = congestion of B26 and B25 = terribly inconsistent speeds. 1 minute youre at 30-50mbps, the next you're at 1-2mbps, and your phone shows the same LTE signal the entire time.  adding more B41 will take people off B25 and B26, they'll both open up and be less congested, as time goes on people will get rid of their B25/B26-only phones, and the step between B41 sites won't be as noticeable."

See this article from September 11, 2014   Spending also is under close scrutiny because Sprint must lower its costs in providing service, Claure said.  “Every single dollar that gets spent out of Sprint gets monitored now,” he said.  Sprint formed an office specifically to manage costs. He has told employees that the company can only spend money on what it needs to have, not on what would be nice to have.  “We have a pretty extensive list that the company has accumulated that are nice-to-haves. Those are the first that are going to go,” he said.  Asked about the list, Claure said he would share it with employees first.     Has this been a big change for folks?"

When i check my account online it says I'm due for a upgrade if I lease a new phone but I don't want to do another two years with sprint because I frequently travel to rural areas where I'm in shitty roaming or no service but while Verizon and AT&T have lte in those areas.

Sprint,3dff44,Linny911,2,Wed Jul 15 21:07:46 2015 UTC,Are you in still in contract? Do you plan on getting a new phone? The unlimited my way plan is still available. To get a plan of your own you and your father would have to complete a transfer of liability to change the ownership of the phone number from him to you. However most of the time the $60 unlimited plan is a better deal. With the lack of credit/income history you should expect to put some money down as well

Sprint,3dff44,pbren345,3,Wed Jul 15 21:24:49 2015 UTC,Call Sprint or go into a store to run your credit and get your own account (write down your ban/account number you will need it) Once you have your own account established you and your dad can complete the change of ownership/transfer online   http://support.sprint.com/support/article/Customer-Instructions-for-Change-of-Ownership/2a4c5654-b645-4613-8262-a689a275e885   After your all set up give customer service a call or go into your local store to get switched into the Unlimited my way plan. Its 80$ a month for unlimited before taxes. If your credit isnt the best you might have to put down $100 or so for a line deposit that you will get back in a year

Sprint,3dbba5,Slimy_turtles,4,Wed Jul 15 00:25:15 2015 UTC,Set LTE only via the radio settings menu. That prevents the phone from connecting to 3G.

Sprint,3dbba5,B1GEast,2,Wed Jul 15 01:49:10 2015 UTC,Can Sprint modify the scan times at all?
Sprint,3dbba5,evan1123,3,Wed Jul 15 00:30:08 2015 UTC,"Probably.. But that's up to Google/LG/Qualcomm to change it. They probably have the settings just right and given the age of the device, no changes will be made."
Sprint,3dbba5,B1GEast,3,Wed Jul 15 00:38:28 2015 UTC,So the scan times are decided by the device/hardware maker and not the carrier?
Sprint,3dbba5,halcyoncmdr,3,Wed Jul 15 11:36:39 2015 UTC,"Someone here once posted that the ""Connection Manager"" Sprint includes with branded devices can re-scan bands based on your location to choose the optimal network. That may be absent on the Nexus 5."
Sprint,3dbba5,Sunny2456,3,Wed Jul 15 01:14:06 2015 UTC,Sprint connections optimizer is just an automated WiFi toggle based on location. It doesn't force network rescans

Sprint,3dbba5,ViceroyFizzlebottom,3,Wed Jul 15 01:29:10 2015 UTC,"There's an app called LTE Discovery made specifically for Sprint users during the tower upgrades. It's one click and it toggles your data without airplane mode, and tries to connect to LTE towers.   Only downside is that in lollipop, it now requires root. No root needed on 4.4."
Sprint,3dbba5,stylz168,2,Wed Jul 15 05:16:05 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, requiring root on Lollipop doesn't seem worth the effort."
Sprint,3dbba5,ViceroyFizzlebottom,3,Wed Jul 15 15:10:31 2015 UTC,It's an issue on the g2 and g3. Sprint just sets a long scan time.
Sprint,3dbba5,stylz168,3,Wed Jul 15 06:24:16 2015 UTC,Why does Sprint do this?
Sprint,3dbba5,sparkedman,2,Wed Jul 15 07:34:39 2015 UTC,Does anybody know what the actual scan time is?
Sprint,3dbba5,stylz168,2,Wed Jul 15 15:10:47 2015 UTC,I think it's between 7 and 12 minutes based on how long I stay in 3g before flipping into LTE in a known lte area.
Sprint,3dbba5,swintec,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:47:17 2015 UTC,"I have seen significantly less scan times, 12 minutes seems excessive. As a test, when I go underground to take the NYC subway, my phone goes from LTE (street level) -> 3G (stairwells) -> LTE (Transit Wireless DAS), all within < 5 minutes."
Sprint,3dbba5,sparkedman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:25:02 2015 UTC,"I think part of my problem might be an active data connection.  I wish it would jump even if I had an active session.

Sprint,3dbba5,halcyoncmdr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:02:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is possible to jump within active sessions, but I would assume that it's due to background data."
Sprint,3dbba5,evan1123,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:06:54 2015 UTC,That's why I'm thinking Background App Refresh on iOS could interfere with this handoff process.   Allow apps to refresh their content when on Wi-Fi or Cellular in the background.   Would having this enabled create an active background data session that could interfere with the 3G/LTE handoff process?
Sprint,3dbba5,halcyoncmdr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:25:26 2015 UTC,"Yep, and sometimes it's just poor timing in general. For example, I walked to work this morning, with both my iPhone 6 and HTC One M9 in my hand. Both devices have push email enabled, and I was not using any of them actively. As I came above ground, the iPhone 6 idled on 3G, and continued to do so for almost 10 minutes till I got to work. The M9 switched to LTE within 2-3 minutes of coming above ground."
Sprint,3dbba5,sparkedman,3,Thu Jul 16 14:12:06 2015 UTC,"Also, if you have a data session going on 3G / EVDO the phone will not break that session to switch to LTE.  So if you have pandora streaming expecting it to switch to LTE in the middle of it, you will be disappointed."
Sprint,3dbba5,roberts2727,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:55:15 2015 UTC,Is this behavior unique to Sprint?
Sprint,3dbba5,sparkedman,4,Wed Jul 15 00:27:51 2015 UTC,"eHRPD solves the IP address issue when transitioning to/from 3G/LTE this originally caused a lot of streaming issues since your IP could change mid-stream. However an active and in-use data session may mean the phone will not switch because it is actively transmitting/receiving.  This would not be unique to Sprint as far as I'm aware unless the app doesn't have enough buffered ahead of time (or the app doesn't buffer much by design and so a pause in the stream would potentially cause an issue so it instead prevents a network type handoff). There are a lot of variables at play with an active data session, a fraction of them involve the network, a fraction the device, and another fraction the app itself."

Sprint,3dbba5,sparkedman,2,Wed Jul 15 02:56:39 2015 UTC,"I've just noticed from my own experience on my iPhone 6 (iOS 8.4, Carrier 20.1) that transitioning from 3G to LTE can sometimes take quite a bit of time, even when no active data session is in progress: No other apps open, etc.  I wonder if Background App Refresh on iOS interferes with this handoff process at all.   Allow apps to refresh their content when on Wi-Fi or Cellular in the background.   Would having this enabled create an active session that could interfere with the 3G/LTE handoff process?"
Sprint,3dbba5,sparkedman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:29:53 2015 UTC,That is interesting.  I assume most streaming apps are robust enough to handle an IP change.  Do most carriers provide a consistent IP across bands? Towers?

Sprint,3d9dvo,Bluevoodo,2,Tue Jul 14 17:38:11 2015 UTC,"Why does $25 buy you 1.5, but $50 buys you ten? Boosts pricing is very unclear. Boost offers huge promotions and plans to people who port in a number, but hardly anything to brand new customers."
Sprint,3d9dvo,anothercookie90,2,Tue Jul 14 18:21:08 2015 UTC,"Why does $25 buy you 1.5, but $50 buys you ten?   That's how they set it up. $50 for 10GB isn't a bad offer IMHO. Prices have really come down, but most companies use a tiered system with a lower cost per GB as you go up. Google's Project Fi is the only data plan I've seen with a flat $10/GB pricing system.  You can get 2GB for $30/month on a phone plan (Including Unlimited Voice/Text) with Autopay enabled. Seems in line with that.   Boosts pricing is very unclear.   Which pricing? This or something else?   Boost offers huge promotions and plans to people who port in a number, but hardly anything to brand new customers.   Doesn't porting in a number make you a new customer?

Sprint,3d9dvo,anothercookie90,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:14:00 2015 UTC,I remember when I had a Virgin Mobile WiMax hotspot for $35 10Gb and Unlimited 3G. They really should offer more data at those price points especially when it doesn't include 3G.
Sprint,3d8nip,Envious684,6,Tue Jul 14 10:49:32 2015 UTC,"The network manages your bands and puts you where it needs you to be dependant on the load of the network. Also, Signal Strength is not the only factor at play here. There is an RSRQ (Refrenced Signal Received Quality) and SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) that come into factor too. I did not do the math on your screenshots but it could be with those numbers you have more throughput on band 25."
Sprint,3d8nip,roberts2727,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:03:32 2015 UTC,"Isn't the whole point of band 26 for better in building penetration? What's the point of it if the network is just gonna throw you onto band 25. Sitting on one  bar of band 25 kills my battery I'm just better off throwing my phone into 3G mode if that's the case. I just moved from t mobile to sprint. They both have low band here but t mobile would always default me to band 12 if it had a higher signal strength than band 4. I'd almost always be on it in buildings here, I figured sprint did something similar."
Sprint,3d8nip,lilotimz,6,Tue Jul 14 13:12:38 2015 UTC,It is but you are not at the point where the network needs to swap you to band 26.  A signal of -104 is not terrible by any means.  - 110+ is when typically the network switches people off of b25.  Network priority is generally  b41-25-26.
Sprint,3d8nip,lilotimz,2,Tue Jul 14 15:05:17 2015 UTC,Is there a reason why they prioritize 25 over 26 even though they share the same amount of bandwidth?
Sprint,3d8nip,sparkedman,3,Tue Jul 14 15:11:03 2015 UTC,Sprint only has a very limited amount of 800 mhz spectrum that they have to conserve for those that really need it.    If one has a decent signal on b25 and its not super congested then they will be placed there. If any band 41 signal is available then the device will be placed there.   Band 26 is the absolute last resort.
Sprint,3d8nip,roberts2727,2,Tue Jul 14 15:13:04 2015 UTC,"Don't mean to go on a tangent, but would Sprint having 600MHz spectrum provide better coverage in this case and for other similar situations?  Or would a ""densified"" network a-la the Next Generation Network plan yield better results?  What do you expect Sprint to go for in the upcoming auction: 5x5 or 10x10 of 600MHz... Or none at all  Interested in your thoughts."
Sprint,3d8nip,sparkedman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:34:01 2015 UTC,From the reports I have read the FCC is giving the middle finger to any reserves. Do you think Sprint or T will be able to realistically outbid Verizon and AT&T?
Sprint,3d8nip,bitslizer,0,Tue Jul 14 15:40:20 2015 UTC,"Currently, the FCC plans to set aside up to 30 MHz of spectrum in a given market for carriers with less than 45 MHz of low-band spectrum in that market. Verizon Wireless (NYSE: VZ) and AT&T will not be able to bid on such reserved spectrum in many markets across the country, especially in major cities.   (Source: 7/2/2015)  T-Mobile has been asking for a 40MHz reserve.  EDIT: If Son opened his wallet, shouldn't Sprint be able to grab a tidy sum?"

Sprint,3d8nip,sparkedman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:59:21 2015 UTC,"If Sprint kept everyone on the band with the stronger signal, 100% of people would be on b26 and never use b25 or b41.  There is network management that takes place, so if you are on b25 the tower has likely determined the signal is strong enough (and at one bar it still probably is).  It is in Sprint's best interest to keep as many people off of b26 as possible because it becomes very congested very fast due to the low amount of spectrum they have on that band plus the fact that the furthest people from the tower (or people in basements or buildings with thick walls) will be stuck on that band.  In almost every case I have encountered, 1 bar of b25 is faster than any amount of bars of b26."

Non-corporate stores are notorious for not giving help to people because all they care about is taking your money and giving little to nothing at all. There was a store like that not far from me that would refuse me service, and I had to go to the corporate store on the other side of town to get things done. Needless to say, that store that was near me is no longer there. But anywho, your phone should be under warranty, call up Sprint technical support, or call up LG, and tell then the situation. There's no reason they shouldn't be able to get another phone out to you. And don't let Sprint charge you that $100-$150 dollars for the insurance deductable."

I spoke to an employee there and he's the one that said there's nothing he can do unless he sees it himself. I then spoke to a manager there and she says there is nothing they can do until they see it and even then the only thing she can do is a factory reset to see if the problem persists. From there she can work on it if it still continues. I will call sprint technical support to see if they can help me, if not from there I'll do a chargeback. Yeah there's no way I'm going to pay the $150 deductible. If it was because I dropped it or wet it I would be more than happy to pay it but this is just a defective phone from the factory so that's not going to happen"
Sprint,3d6zb1,praemonitus_,2,Tue Jul 14 11:47:21 2015 UTC,"It would be a free replacement under your insurance, just like it should be for your G2. The deductible applies to something YOU did, not defects. If they've been telling you otherwise, they're lying.   Try again at the end of the month to see if they're more lax when they know how many exchanges have been done. I know my store was more conservative until then because it puts the store in a bad position if they exceed their budgeted replacements."
Sprint,3d6zb1,praemonitus_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:35:16 2015 UTC,"Ask for a manager at the repair store, assuming it is a corporate location. Explain your situation. LG phones are notorious for display issues, and I've seen the camera issues you've described on other phones. I don't understand how someone would say they have to see it with their own eyes when you have proof of the problem. If you get a replacement, though, it will be refurbished. Ask them to check the CEBU forums for reports of similar issues.   If the manager isn't willing to work with you, contact your credit card company for a charge back. Pretty sure defective merchandise is covered by all good cards. Also pretty sure the burden is on Sprint to prove the phone isn't defective. You don't have anything to lose with a charge back request."

I know all about the display problems lg has. I have a g2 and the screen acts up so bad that you can't even touch it because it is constantly opening apps closing that going side to side and there's just nothing you can do. I've then  bought a g3 and it was a good phone. The only thing is is that I've had antenna issues so I'm actually sending it back to squaretrade so they can fix it. I'm kind of tempted to just keep my g3 after getting it fixed and waiting for the note 5 because I don't know if I want another LG phone after all the problems I've had.

Sprint,3d4ec4,nemoid,2,Mon Jul 13 13:39:26 2015 UTC,Sprint offers a very robust 30-60 Day Trial of their services for corporate users to alleviate these fears. Most of our trials turn into wins if it is calls/text the end users are worried about.
Sprint,3d4ec4,roberts2727,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:06:25 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about this. I think a lot of companies could get by with Sprint with their massive roaming agreements. The two corporations I worked at, you only have a smart phone for two reasons. One is to talk, which Sprint does great at. The second is to check email which works fine even on 3G and if you have a hint of patients it works on 1x.   If you actually need data and have to work remotely they had out hotspots, which these can be VZW.  These corps I have worked at in the last few months, the classic blackberries and iPhone 4s are the primary phones using VZW network so that means 3G. These two businesses together are 35,000 employees, so they are big companies.  Those I know with LTE smartphone or even hotspots just abuse the devices and use over 100GB month on company dime for personal use."
Sprint,3d4ec4,MrNagant,2,Mon Jul 13 18:12:23 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends on the business.  I'm in Engineering/Construction and can't get by with Sprint.  I'm based out of Manhattan, and typically have pretty decent service.  But for example, last week I was across the Hudson (<1 mile) at a site, and needed to pull up a drawing on my phone for the contractor.  The phone was constantly switching between 3G and LTE and refused to do anything aside from drain my battery.  It was embarrassing."

Sprint,3d4ec4,stylz168,2,Mon Jul 13 21:54:26 2015 UTC,Here's the official Press Release
Sprint,3d4ec4,stylz168,2,Mon Jul 13 16:05:50 2015 UTC,"From Article:   Sprint (NYSE: S) is unveiling a new pricing structure for business customers that includes in one price point the cost of devices and service as well as a host of new value-added services and customer support.   ....   The new offering, called Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS), lets businesses simply choose the device for their employee, the appropriate data packages and then whether the term of the agreement will last for 12 months or 24 months. The service can scale down to businesses that have as few as 15 lines, and up to businesses with 5,000 lines, but it is designed for corporate-liable accounts.   ....   The plans include unlimited voice and texting, a range of pooled data plans, including 100 MB, 1 GB, 2 GB and 5 GB, with prices ranging from $20 per month up to $70 per month for the 5 GB bucket. There is also an unlimited data option that costs between $65 and $75 per month. Sprint also has five different device tiers on the plans, including from iconic premium smartphones, iconic smartphones, smartphones, premium tablets and tablets and feature phones. All of the devices come with extended warranties.  Basically, a higher-tier device will cost more per month than a lower-tier device, and the more data an employee has, the more it will cost. So, for example, an employee on a 24-month plan with a 16 GB iPhone 6, which is in the iconic smartphone tier, would be on a plan that costs $50 per month for 2 GB, $65 for 5 GB and $70 for unlimited data. Adding more internal memory would tack on an extra $5 per month per memory upgrade.  Additionally, there are volume discounts. At 25 lines, the cost per employee drops $5 per month and at 100 lines it drops by $10 per month.  If customers are put on the 12-month plans, prices are generally $10 more per month, since the cost of device is more per month. At the end of the 12 or 24 months, employees can either turn in their device for a new model or hold onto it and Sprint will work with the businesses.  Sprint is hoping the value-added services are what set MaaS apart. In addition, businesses purchasing wireless through MaaS will receive a dedicated care team to provide 24/7/365 white-glove technical support, meaning each account will have a dedicated customer care representative.  Sprint will also help business customers with device configuration and preloading of existing business applications at no extra cost. However, if business need to develop new applications, Sprint will work with them to develop those apps for a separate fee.  The plans also include Sprint ""International Value Roaming,"" which offers free unlimited 2G data and texting and calls at 20 cents per minute in 27 countries.  Sprint will also include on-site implementation support on orders of 25 devices or more.  Additionally, each business can name a number of ""VIP"" subscribers such as business owners or C-level executives to receive an additional level of customer service (for example, if a CEO lost their phone, Sprint would move to replace it within hours). For every 50 lines, businesses will get one ""VIP"" account.  Sprint is aiming to also include free cloud storage and anti-virus capabilities to the MaaS offering, probably by September, according to John Tudhope, director of product marketing at Sprint. He declined to say which providers or partners would be offering those services.     It'll be interesting to see how this goes. Still don't understand why they axed 12 month leases on the consumer side.  Looks like the price for Unlimited Data went up a bit here too."

Sprint,3d4ec4,TheOnlyProfelec,2,Mon Jul 13 20:57:34 2015 UTC,"Indeed, they are offered, but it's a strange way to think about it. Here's a 24 month lease, but you can buy up to an annual upgrade for $10/month. It was so much more simple when it said ""12 month lease""."

Sprint,3d4nlp,tsumeone,2,Tue Jul 14 16:32:45 2015 UTC,The 1 year lease price was always $10 more than the 2 year lease price when I did my phone shopping at Sprint a few months ago.  You can still get a 1 year lease effectively by getting a 2 year lease and paying the extra $10/mo for annual upgrades.  The price and outcome are both the same.
Sprint,3d4nlp,Xymia,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:29:16 2015 UTC,Absolutely correct. The price is exactly the same. They just changed how it works.
Sprint,3d5c4w,mitchdean,4,Mon Jul 13 17:24:40 2015 UTC,My understanding is that the Nexus 6 is already Domestic Sim Unlocked and that a SIM from any carrier will work.   I am guessing you still need to call Sprint so they can update the IMEI or whatever to work on their network.  As far as WiFi calling - it's not (yet) available on the Nexus 6 on Sprint.  Not sure if it will ever be.

Sprint,3d5c4w,SprintEmployeeAMA,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:17:20 2015 UTC,"This is admittedly kind of a limited-use situation. The reason many Sprint employees use the ""one use"" line is that in our sales system, when we scan in a phone, the ICCID (SIM card number) that was issued with the phone automatically pops up.   It's also that some cards are literally not compatible with others. Most 3FF (""Micro"") SIM cards will not authenticate correctly with phones that require 4FF (""Nano""), even though on other carriers all that is needed is a SIM card cutter."

Its slightly too big for the pocket, too big for one-handed use, and the battery life isn't that great. It really is a beta phone with buggy software (force crashes, delayed notifications, syncing errors) and its missing features that are standard on flagships (IR Blaster, Notification Light, Fingerprint Scanner, SD Card, Removable Battery). The ONLY benefit is that you get the latest updates fast, which was why I bought it to begin with. I was hoping Android M would take advantage of the larges screen with multi-windowing, but even Apple beat them to that. I regret the $500 purchase every day and might move to the iPhone 6S or whatever. I wanted to sell it, but the resale value tanked hard."

Sprint,3cz64d,lilotimz,2,Sun Jul 12 03:22:40 2015 UTC,"I'm curious if they will be able to renew their roaming agreement with Verizon after it expires in 2017, or if they even want to. It's good that they are starting to light up some type of roaming, and the fact that we will have usable data in US Cellular areas is fantastic news! I think it would be wise for them to so that they have some sort of coverage in places that CCA won't cover, or has yet to cover though. But I guess Verizon could possibly say no to the renewal too.  Does anybody else have any input on this?"
Sprint,3cz64d,abcgeek,5,Sun Jul 12 03:40:37 2015 UTC,"Son has said that paying the exhorbant roaming fees to their direct competitors (Vzw) is something they wish to avoid at all costs in the future.   I'd imagine Sprint will build out, via NGN, new cell sites in areas that users roam the most on Verizon while removing Verizon roaming all together in areas where Sprint parters exist be it pseudo native Sprint affiliates or CCA off network roaming ones.   They'll probably keep Verizon roaming coverage in speciic areas where Sprint has no reason to expand to or does not yet plan to expand into and no other alternatives exist."
Sprint,3cz64d,lilotimz,2,Sun Jul 12 03:53:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I also wonder wonder if they are going to apply that same reasoning backhual."
Sprint,3cz64d,abcgeek,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:57:23 2015 UTC,"So, do you think they will cut out in market roaming altogether with Verizon?"
Sprint,3cz64d,lilotimz,3,Sun Jul 12 03:57:20 2015 UTC,Probably.   Paying $100-200+ per gb of data to Vzw for roaming costs is just extortion that Son and Marcelo wants to get rid of if they have the opportunity to do so.   If the NGN does what Marcelo and Co advertises it'll do then one wouldn't roam on Vzw in the first place.
Sprint,3cz64d,abcgeek,2,Sun Jul 12 04:26:55 2015 UTC,"Woah, is that really how much they pay per GB? No wonder they reserve the right to give you the boot after 100MB"
Sprint,3cz64d,lilotimz,4,Sun Jul 12 04:56:31 2015 UTC,Yeah.  Verizon and ATT extorts the shit out of everyone In roaming costs because they can and no one else can really do anything about it.   Att was forced to open their network for tmobile roaming  but they were never forced to make roaming cheap so tmobile has to figure out exactly which specific cell sites and areas to have roaming and only up to 50 Mbs.  Likewise sprint started hard capping it at 100-300 Mbs due to excessive roaming usage because previously it was a loophole used to get out of contracts due to usually Verizon roaming which made it unprofitable to keep the subscriber due to roaming costs.  That's why sprint made a hell of a big deal out of the CCA partnership and funding a lot of the smaller carriers network deployments in return for reciprocal roaming rights or cheaper off network roaming deals.    Wouldn't surprise me if they relax  the roaming data caps  on the CCA partner networks in the future because it's a hell of a lot cheaper now than when the old deals were in effect.
Sprint,3cz64d,abcgeek,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:06:50 2015 UTC,"Do they really hard cap now? I didn't realize, I thought it was just if you went over your limit, you ran the risk of getting your service terminated. That's the way it appears with the wording in the TOS too.  That's crazy, do they charge like that for minutes and texting too, or are they a little more reasonable with that?  I wish they had some sort of timeline for CCA roaming."
Sprint,3cz64d,abcgeek,2,Sun Jul 12 05:26:46 2015 UTC,"I thought Dec 31 2015 is when it expires.  Also, I'd imagine that Sprint will keep it. With Sprint gaining traction with CCA roaming, roaming on VZW will be reduced a lot. VZW might increase rates a lot, I think the most Sprint would do is just completely remove VZW only in markets where they have different primary partners."
Sprint,3cz64d,Slimy_turtles,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:47:20 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm remembering wrong, but I recall reading somewhere that it was good through 2017. I'm not sure. As I don't have a source, we'll go with what you said. I think it's possible they could get rid of it in places where they have partners and native coverage. It's a nice bonus to me, that even in market, if Sprint's signal doesn't reach me my phone will pick up Verizon's signal. Like if I'm deep inside a building or something like that, though that rarely happens, so I don't see how that can cost them too much money to have that fallback in place.  I'm wondering how both sides will be looking at the renewal."

I finally upgraded to this Asus AC-RT68U when the Buffalo abruptly dies with no warning.

Be able to sell. I always made my candidates do a sales role play on the floor. Yeah it's awkward but if you can do well faking it you'll be fine with a customer.   The manager doesn't care if you know specs and small stuff about phone. They care if you can articulate your statements and are comfortable in our own skin. Confidence is key to sales.   Good luck.

The Network improvements are already underway, throwing money at it can't make it go faster. If that's all it needed I'm sure SoftBank would be taking that route already. People seem to keep forgetting that unlike the other carriers Sprint's replacing the entire network from scratch, including their 3G network.

Sprint,3csyk9,halcyoncmdr,5,Sat Jul 11 05:48:30 2015 UTC,"Everything that comprises ""service"". Both of those and more. Throwing money at expanding the network would absolutely speed it up.

There's places in my city that I haven't had service for the decades that I've had sprint and that's just inexcusable.   Sprint is just lucky that Verizon makes me sick to my stomach, otherwise I would have moved to them ages ago."
Sprint,3csyk9,jet_heller,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:25:08 2015 UTC,"I switched from Verizon to Sprint last December because my interactions with Verizon staff were always unpleasant. The company was profit-driven to the point of being detrimental to the customer experience in their stores. I never walked out of a Verizon store feeling good about my interaction with them, but I always saw the results I wanted. On the other hand, Sprint's customer service--while friendlier--doesn't get me results.  For example, I went to Canada last month. I called Sprint's international billing department before I left to temporarily expand my coverage, but I spent the weekend without cell phone and data coverage because my phone wouldn't connect to any towers. And the expansion fee still showed up on my bill.  Even more egregious than that, my very first bill wasn't what I verbally agreed to with the representative who opened my account. I was paying $15/month more than she said I would (she didn't take the expanded insurance off my bill even though I said I didn't want it), and my phone was set on a two-year lease plan when I specifically told her I wanted to buy it on a payment plan. And to add insult to injury, I'm fairly certain she didn't give me all of my receipts because my $200 down payment on the phone isn't listed on any of them.  That's just two of a series of negative experiences I've had with Sprint staff. Sprint pushes their employees to provide a friendly service, but it doesn't mean shit if every interaction fails to provide satisfactory results.  With Verizon, I know where I stand. Customer support is frustrating, but the results are always satisfactory. The bills are purposefully obtuse, but I always ended up paying what I agreed to for services (successfully) rendered. The bill is higher and my data is capped, but at least with Verizon I had reliable, fast data (and yes, I live in a highly populated dark orange LTE zone on Sprint's coverage map, but I don't even have a reliable voice signal in my bedroom).  I'm jumping ship as soon as I have the cash to break contract, and I'd recommend all Sprint customers try either Verizon or AT&T for a contract cycle before renewing with Sprint."

Sprint,3csyk9,klakzky,9,Tue Jul 14 10:52:58 2015 UTC,"I think everyone has beaten the fiber/backhaul issue and the 2.5 ghz deployment issues to death. Sprint has a bad track record of deploying upgrades and new technologies and its well known.  However, what isn't talked about enough is that TMobile's turnaround has in large part also been due to its marking and communications strategy. TMobile probably had negative brand equity until 2012. TMobile was synonymous with poor coverage, terrible building penetration and an overall languishing network. Then Legere and his team basically complete a brand overhaul and position themselves as the carrier that fights for customers in an industry that was hated as much the cable/broadband industries. All of its uncarrier moves are part of a larger coordinated marketing strategy that has worked. Their brand now has actual value. This is why when the TMobile-Sprint merger was still a possibility, Softbank was going to kill the Sprint brand and take on the TMobile name. They have built brand equity from scratch through fantastic marketing.   TMobile isn't even the cheapest option anymore. Sprint has plans that beat TMobile now. But Sprint's plans can be confusing and have been poorly marketed. Take leasing for example. That's Sprint's idea but TMobile takes the same idea, makes a big event about how users can switch phones 3 times a year via lease and they get coverage everywhere. Where was Sprint with that kind of marketing considering they were the ones to introduce leasing to begin with. TMobile modifies the idea and all of a sudden they are blowing up in the media.   Sprint's marketing teams need to be replaced with a team capable of rebranding the company properly. The current tired marketing strategies are just bad."

I get great service once I am 40-50 miles outside of the metro area.. but that is what is even more frustrating.. why would the rural areas have better coverage. And I am talking 12M down/ 5M up data connection outside the city limits but struggle to get 1M/1M in the core of Atlanta. It does not matter if I am at Tech, the Dome, Sandy Springs, Buckhead...   And the really crazy part is when I am in Overland Park my friends with Verizon get better coverage and data speeds!! I am not an RF guy, I have been told it is because of the tower on campus, but why in the world 3-4 years later and campus coverage is still horrible."

Sprint,3csyk9,nemoid,9,Sat Jul 11 22:59:37 2015 UTC,"I think the issue is Sprint's taking too long to get B41 rolled out.  It is literally their solution to their biggest issue, network speeds.  Of course with Next Generation Network coming around the corner, the issue may be remedied, but I feel that Sprint has really dragged their feet on implementing their spectrum assets.  And I'm talking about the sites that already have backhaul upgrades (B25/B26 active).  It's quite obvious Sprint has chosen cheaper alternatives/routes at the cost of slow network speeds.  Perhaps their budget wasn't quite as efficient as T-Mobile's was, but seeing that T-Mobile, who has almost 20K sites more than Sprint, roll out B12/B4 wideband at such a quick pace really makes people question Sprint's ability to properly execute their plans.    I have high hopes in Marcelo, but to be honest Sprint's brand perception needs work and they only brought it upon themselves by sitting on B41 with all of that potential."

Having to constantly tell your customers ""sorry bud, you need a new phone"" doesn't cut it."
Sprint,3csyk9,nemoid,3,Fri Jul 10 20:34:08 2015 UTC,"The Nexus 6 supports B41, but it does not support Carrier Aggregation.  So it doesn't support the 120+Mbps speeds."

Sprint,3csyk9,Ascertion,2,Mon Jul 13 13:48:00 2015 UTC,"One factor that worked to T-Mobile's advantage was that many of their cell sites already had fiber backhaul. This, in addition to efficient project management by the T-Mobile network guys, meant a relatively quick rollout was possible.  Compare that to Sprint's Network Vision rip/replace which also involved a digging/trenching component for new fiber backhaul...  As for the vendor delays for backhaul Sprint experienced.... That hurt. You'd have new gear on a site just waiting for new backhaul."
Sprint,3csyk9,lilotimz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:05:42 2015 UTC,I'm referring to actual B41 deployment.  They could have been rolling that out as soon as NV 1.0 sites were converted to LTE.    I understand their limitations in regards to the initial B25 deployment.
Sprint,3csyk9,sparkedman,2,Mon Jul 13 14:08:09 2015 UTC,No. The Sprint 2.5 deployment began in earnest in mid 2014 and did not get into heavy deployment until late summer 2014. There was no physical manner for them to deploy 8T8R 2.5 deployment before then as the equipment was not yet finished in design or field testing until 2014.
Sprint,3csyk9,Ascertion,3,Fri Jul 10 15:24:39 2015 UTC,"IIRC, the delays with Band 41 deployment were partially due to an availability shortage of new 8T8R Gear."

Sprint deploying its own equipment to Clearwire site locations are slowly starting now with the first Clearwire colocations going live but the vast majority of Clear overlays by Sprint will not begin until late 2015/2016.   Clearwire sites capable of 2nd Band 41 carriers (samsung) and carrier aggregation are going live already alongside wimax thinning (they have to shut down Wimax to fire up 2nd B41 carrier).
Sprint,3csyk9,lilotimz,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:28:15 2015 UTC,"Welp, I hope they get to the remaining clearwire sites soon.  I hear it's supposed to slow down, then speed up.

Sprint,3csyk9,halcyoncmdr,4,Fri Jul 10 18:57:12 2015 UTC,For Clearwire sites they don't have to mess with a lot of them yet. Eventually the regional vendors will but their priority is overlaying their own macro sites first because Clear didn't cover everything and everywhere and the existing Clear b41 sites are a very helpful for the short term for added capacity and coverage due to a denser network.   The only areas where Sprint has to get really going for overlays are the Huawei regions where Sprint is mandated to deactivate and decomission the Huawei equipment.   I expect those to really begin in early 2016 since there's a federal mandate to do so and the equipment doesn't support a second 20 mhz Band 41 carrier unlike the Samsung Clear equipment.   TBH this will probably all be funded by the NGN so 3-6 months is a good time frame from initial funding to the first live deployments.
Sprint,3csyk9,jamar030303,2,Fri Jul 10 19:01:19 2015 UTC,"Many of the old Clearwire sites already had inadequate backhaul from before Network Vision as well. It was fine for the WiMax users that were there, but when it came down to adding LTE on top of it the backhaul started to croak."
Sprint,3csyk9,sparkedman,4,Fri Jul 10 19:07:54 2015 UTC,"Some thoughts on possible improvements:  One big selling point T-Mobile has is international. Sprint's part of SoftBank now, and while they can't expand their reach as far as T-Mobile yet, I see some moves they could be making in that direction still:  First off, there's no shortage of US military and other DoD staff moving in and out of Japan all the time. They should be earning some brownie points here by, say, providing the Japan add-on free to military/DoD staff and dependents short-term.   Two possible approaches to long-term:   Offer a US+Japan ""no-borders"" type plan where the ""majority of usage must be on Sprint"" requirement and the add-on fee is waived, maybe only for military, maybe for other people moving to Japan also.  Offer assistance setting up service with SoftBank before arrival. Suspend your Sprint service, sign up for SoftBank, either prepaid or postpaid, arrive in Japan, pick up your phone at the airport counter. Coming back, offer assistance setting your Sprint service back up on return.    The second one isn't a new concept- NTT docomo already does this. They let you set up service with their T-Mobile MVNO here before leaving Japan, and let you sign a docomo service agreement here and order a phone ready to use to pick up at the airport on return to Japan. docomo also allows last-minute signups for  international roaming at their service desk in Honolulu and a couple other places. I imagine some first-time tourists would appreciate being able to set up their phones for roaming after arrival in Japan if they forgot to before leaving home.   I'm surprised that in the time since the merger, that SoftBank and Sprint haven't already set this up to keep people on both sides ""in the family"", so to speak. They could make this their niche and corner this market.  Another idea:  Verizon's old ""global"" SIMs used to be Vodafone NL SIMs. Sprint could offer SoftBank SIMs in the same way so that the phone-married-to-SIM problem could be avoided while overseas. Not only does it help with people with CDMA-only phones (just buy an unlocked or SoftBank-branded phone, insert ""international"" SIM, and go), it also helps with people with phones with a... less complete set of roaming bands (One time in Osaka I stepped into a hair salon and lost coverage on my Sprint phone while my native SoftBank phone showed full signal, for instance).  But first they need to push their Japan add-on more. I didn't even know about it until someone here on Reddit told me!  So ends my wall of text."

I expect the Uncarriers to continue until their subs start decreasing, or they run out of ideas.  TMo is doing a decent job of having each Uncarrier effecting a decent amount of customers, and some even all customers.    I think Sprint could do good if they copied TMo tit for tat and did their own.  Only TMo fanboys will complain about that and bad talk TMo.  If Sprint can copy and add their own here or there it would do a solid.  The fannies don't even know that a lot of ideas TMo ""copies"" from other carriers or MVNOs. They just happen to be a top dog player doing it.  Another thing that Sprint could do, which I rather them do is do a massive network expansion. Have a team work on B25/26 that puts 80% of their effort into expansion.  Sprint has over 100 towers in Montana now, those need to be on like now for example.  Then have two teams that do B41.

Sprint,3csyk9,myfapaccount_istaken,3,Sat Jul 11 04:22:09 2015 UTC,I completely agree on this. Sprint's policies on this has been why resale value on Sprint devices has been lower traditionally.

Sprint,3csyk9,MalenkoMC,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:37:28 2015 UTC,Applecare is an apple product.  It is their responsibly to transfer to the new device.  If sprint refunded Applecare then they lost the $99 as they pay that cost directly to Apple.  We check an apple database to see if your device gas Applegate.  Once it's sold to you sprint had no control of it.
Sprint,3csyk9,mitten_mike,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:34:47 2015 UTC,When you order Applecare through Sprint how do you assign it to the device? Do you not update the IMEI database?
Sprint,3csyk9,mitten_mike,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:48:43 2015 UTC,"its it added as a ""SOC"" to the account. just like TEP or whatever. However it auto expires the next day or 14 days later (forget which) and is coded to not ""prorate"" like most SCOs do. This then scripts to Apple the IMEI of the device on the account at the time Apple care was added, Tells Apple ""Hey we owe you $99"" and then places that charges on your account. Beyond that we only check the Apple database when we ""agents"" pull yoru IMEI either on the phone in Eticket or in the Retail System.   Edit: Also since We have TEP now for the devices. AppleCare isn't even part of training beyond if you see this check box they can go to apple for more information."
Sprint,3csyk9,maxsilver,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:52:49 2015 UTC,"I live in PDX and have noticed that, increasingly, my service is more reliable than my partner, who has AT&T. It's not as blazing fast, but I never get throttled, I have truly unlimited data, minutes, etc, and...yeah. Sure, the 3G isn't great, but I'm lucky in that generally, I have LTE now almost everywhere I go. I've been watching them role it out in increasing waves for 18 months and it's getting better.   However, I am a relatively recent Sprint convert (I didn't have a smartphone until 3 years ago, and switched 4 years ago). Another friend of mine also switched recently and the fact of the matter is, AT&T offers faster top speeds (their ""3G"" on an iPhone 4s and up is the HSPA+, or ""4G"") and Verizon has the biggest footprint, even though they both throttle and are spendy. However, to the people that really HAVE to prioritize network access in every nook and cranny of the cities, or that need top speeds, they don't have to worry (as much) about price.   In regards to T-mobile, they have bang up marketing and yeah, they're super cheap. You throw in the fact that Sprint bet on the wrong horse with WiMax and also goofed the Nextel acquisition (or so I've come to understand) and boom, that's how T-Mobile wins. Sprint shot themselves in the foot so that they can't compete for coverage or reliability with AT&T and Verizon, and the bad taste that their choices left in the mouths of many value consumers is enough to turn people to T-Mobile. Your T-Mobile customer that's prioritizing price above all else is, bluntly, more easily swayed by both price, flashy adds and the nasty stuff they've heard about Sprint than by any actual experience with the network. I personally switched from T-Mobile because their customer service was absolutely abysmal and I got tired of getting jerked around with fake fees and overage charges and all that standard T-Mobile bullshit (I will NEVER ever switch back to them). But again, for your budget consumer- and let's face it, Sprint's chasing the budget consumer now, because they just can't compete to get top-tier users- 1 great ad and a few extra dollars off your bill is worth more to suck people in and keep them turned against a service that they've only heard is bad than 100 positive ads that Sprint can run. In short, the T-Mobile consumer that's swelling T-Mobile's user base is easily swayed by the tactics that T-Mobile's using given that Sprint poisoned their own well."

I've been with Sprint for 1 year and Virgin Mobile for 3 years before that. VM had decent service, but the problem is that Sprint got a lot more subscribers and the service became poor. - I noticed especially after iPhones became available on Sprint. When I switched to Sprint, I was told that my service issues were all because of prioritization - since I was on VM, I was a lower priority customer in congested areas (living in LA County, there's a lot of people with a lot of phones all over) than the people on Sprint that pay more. I got my new Sprint phone, and the service has been exactly the same except for the fact I can roam on Verizon's network now. I was told the upgrades would come, but there's still a deadzone in my house and my speeds in LA can be as poor as 0.02 Mbps...or as high as 60 Mbps.   I've stayed with Sprint because I love the price. I want them to succeed. But I'm still considering paying the premium for T-Mobile and switching because they've been able to prove they're working on their network. I'm not seeing any improvements here in the LA area. I'm not seeing any plans for better service. The coverage maps lie to me about my area. I'm trying to love Sprint, but I find it hard to do so."
Sprint,3csyk9,linuxlearningnewbie,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:05:11 2015 UTC,"Personally, I really lost all respect for Sprint when they did away with ""Free phones.""  It used to be that you could get a free new phone for signing a 2 year deal.  Believe it or not, it was basically leasing the device in a way.  Now, I have to pay for EVERYTHING AND they keep RAISING the prices without improving my service at all!  The first big NO NO to me was when they started charging that BS ""Premium Data"" $10 charge for having a smart phone.  I was already paying for unlimited data, why did I have to pay a premium charge as well for the same data that I was already using?  This is the first time I almost left.  Now that you can't get a free phone anymore, it costs an arm and a leg to get a new device.  Currently, I am paying a minimum of $25/mo per phone for 3 phones.  That's $75/mo just in phones.  Then you tack on the $11/mo per phone for TPP and I'm over $100 already and we haven't even gotten to service yet.  It's insane!!    The company is nickel and dimeing their customers and forcing them into options that could technically be covered in the lease... imo.  But I guess all the companies are that way...

Sprint, Verizon, and AT&T, are playing the same game where they're strategically building an extensive network around coverage, reliability, call and text quality, while T-Mobile seems to be playing their own game where token speed tests and customer additions are more important than long-term profitability.   Sprint has a plan, they've explained their plan in detail, most people know their plan, and plans take time to implement. The only thing to do now is wait for them to complete it.  In the mean time they're offering as much as they can without losing sight of profitability and sustainability. Promotions and 'moves' cost money; giving stuff to customers instead of charging them for it costs money (tethering, roaming, device giveaways, free unlimited service, etc.) It all costs them money in forgone earnings.  What is Sprint doing wrong? From a business perspective nothing. They're doing fantastic on the business side. Literally, their only problem is with their network.

How is it in Sprint's interest to prioritize, in any way, providing customer service to a client that's leaving, and not only leaving, but going to their biggest rival at present? Brownie points? If someone's leaving Sprint for T-NoNo, they're likely never coming back to Sprint (and I'd bet they've focused grouped the shit out of their customers to know just how never of a never that is). My personal experience with Sprint's service has been so many light years beyond my experience with T-Mobile and AT&T that it's literally zero comparison.

He puts me back in the exact queue system I was in!   Second call   Answered in under 30 seconds. Rep pulls up my account with no issues.

Third Call   Answers in 6 seconds Rep processes my domestic and international unlock in less than 5 minutes.  Rep starts to process a second domestic and international unlock put states that the phone is not eligible for an unlock. She puts in a clickit ticket to see if they will process the unlock. Takes all of my contact information in case there is a need for follow-up. Sets up a land line service.   Why should a company do anything for a former customer?    The phone that was carrier unlocked is going to a friend in Dothan that has horrible Sprint coverage and will be using the phone on T-Mobile and then using it internationally. You never know who you are helping or how that assistance will benefit someone else. Here is a young kid saving a few hundred bucks not having to buy a phone or waste any time worrying about phone service when his mind is wrapped around deployment.  I signed up for land line service. I am still a Sprint customer again. Why, Sprint does not engage in policies that I deem harmful to the consumer like ATT and Verizon does.  I moved a few lines of service over to Ting. Some of those lines ended up on Sprint and some on T-Mobile. Once again Sprint picks up a few customers.   You never know how your actions will affect someone. I still believe your opinion is wrong and I would like to change it.  :)   I think everyone deserves excellent service until they do something that forces you to stop providing respect. And even then it is on the individual. Sprint is a great company with a lot of potential that I hope will challenge Verizon and ATT. On the other side of the coin are a lot of people who saving five bucks a month is a big deal. They should not be denied service because they are moving their business somewhere else. It is never personal it is just business.   And a huge shout out to Sherry who helped me with my service."

With that in mind ""jailbreaking"" and modding with ROMS can cause those issues when coming into the stores.

Sprint,3cp9e2,checkyour6,3,Thu Jul 9 17:53:45 2015 UTC,IIRC: It's the scanner timer on the iPhone which is causing this to happen.  Have you updated your PRL/Data Profile and Carrier Version? [Settings--> General--> About: you must be running the most current version of iOS to do this]  I assume you're running the latest version of iOS?  EDIT: The latest carrier version is Sprint 20.1

Sprint,3cp9e2,Vtrossi,2,Thu Jul 9 18:29:43 2015 UTC,"It's because the Sprint network isn't tuned right, and the iPhone isn't programmed right, either. The iPhone may be the worst of the bunch, but androids are also having band switching problems. It's like Sprint can't figure out how to get triband to work seamlessly with their devices. I got tired of watching my iPhone fall to 3G, when there's a -95dbm band 26 signal present, so I left sprint. When they fix this issue, I'll come back."
Sprint,3cp9e2,sparkedman,0,Thu Jul 9 20:03:52 2015 UTC,Isn't Apple also partially responsible for this since the scanner timer is baked into iOS?
Sprint,3cp9e2,Vtrossi,2,Thu Jul 9 20:09:40 2015 UTC,"Not really. Even Android has a scan timer. Android users can usually modify their scan timers if need be. My point is, the phones shouldn't be dropping to 3G in the first place. They're skipping right over band 26 in favor of 3G. It causes a bad image for Sprint by having customers pull their phone out indoors and constantly seeing 3G, while their red, blue, and magenta friends are humming along on LTE. Apple/Sprint really needs to get the right carrier bundle out there to work on this problem."

And in the month of August, I think I took my first day in the job was August 12 in Kansas City, our share of gross adds was 10%. When you’re 10%, that means you are not even part of the conversation, you’re irrelevant. When you go from a – when you have a market share of 16%, and a share of gross adds of 10%, that means you are under-indexing your true capabilities.

The quality of our subscribers that we were attracting, they were lot more in sub-prime area than I would have liked.  So, those sort of things were a big surprise.

Sprint,3cp63p,noname9300,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:49:42 2015 UTC,"From Article:   Sprint’s small cell rollout has been a hot topic all summer, and even though it has not been announced yet, recruiters and installers are getting ready to move fast. Sprint has confirmed nothing, but hopeful vendors are now expecting the carrier to deploy up to 70,000 outdoor picocells.  Small cells are expected to be the primary focus of Sprint’s network upgrade, with macro network upgrades on the back burner, perhaps until after the next spectrum auction.  Mobilitie is expected to a primary partner for Sprint, charged with securing the sites and negotiating terms for deployment. Deployment of 70,000 outdoor small cells would require the acquisition of roughly the same number of discrete sites. Operators typically look for utility poles, lamp posts, church steeples and other structures that rise above most roof levels. Most sites will require zoning, permitting and negotiations with municipal authorities.  In addition, Mobilitie may fund some portion of the Sprint deployment, according to analyst Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo Securities. Mobilitie, a privately held company, declined to comment. Fritzsche said that while the financing model is unclear, the expectation of a small cell focus is very strong.  “Small cells is clearly a large focus,” said Fritzsche. “Seventy thousand seemed to be the whispered about number [and]that is confirmed by several sources I have talked to. It seems like it could be Mobilitie as the winner of this contract. … It is a big number and we know that Son has had luck with small cells and it’s an important part of his Japanese focus with Softbank, so I think what he’s trying to do is mirror that here.”  Softbank, which owns 78% of Sprint, has already deployed a small cell network in Japan. The company’s hyperdense network uses cloud-controlled base stations no bigger than a suitcase, packing in as many as 150 per square kilometer in Japan’s largest cities. Softbank has also installed thousands of small cells on post offices throughout rural Japan, using satellite backhaul.  Network densification makes sense for Sprint given its ownership structure and its spectrum position. Sprint owns spectrum in the 2.5 GHz band that it has not yet put to work, and this high-band spectrum is most suitable for deployments in dense urban areas. High-band spectrum does not support signals that must travel long distances because higher frequencies mean shorter wavelengths.  In addition to Mobilitie, Nokia and Airspan have been named as potential Sprint vendors for its small cell rollout. Airspan has developed outdoor small cells that are optimized for pole-mounted deployments and that leverage a virtualized radio access network. Nokia’s Flexi-Zone microcell/picocell base stations support the most common LTE bands and support integrated Wi-Fi.     Macro builds are being put on the ""back burner""? Really?"

Depending on your account, if you have an account spending limit or not it will be nothing out of pocket up front. The best part is it requires you to keep the same plan in order to keep the credit so you dont have to worry about being forced off the legacy plan in order to get the best deal.

Sprint,3cp5cu,3WordPosts,2,Thu Jul 9 18:44:10 2015 UTC,Well when it comes to leasing/ez pay/2yr the breaking of phones all ends in the same situation of either going through insurance or paying for a new phone outright at msrp or through swappa craigslist etc. The lease just allows you to decide if you want to buy the phone at the end of the 24 months instead of buying it from the begining.
Sprint,3cp5cu,Guy_Gerricault,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:02:03 2015 UTC,"And adding an additional $5/mo on the bill for a loyalty lease if they are on a 1500 plan.   If you did a 2 year upgrade and got an iphone 6  or GS6 its $200 in store.  Doesn't matter if your phone is broken or not.  To lease this phone on the same plan its $5 per month on the bill ($120 over 24 months) and if the phone is broken at the end its still $200 to buy it out.  Leasing either costs the customer $120 or $320 over two years, the two year contract is a guaranteed $200"
Sprint,3cp5cu,3WordPosts,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:07:20 2015 UTC,Well breaking phones is not a foregone conclusion but if we are thinking that way if you break a $200 phone on contract pricing 10 months into your contract your either going to file a claim spending the $150-200 on a deductible or your going to replace the phone with something thats equal to what you have. If you do that and you want a new in box one your paying full msrp which for top tier phones can be $650-1000 to replace dependong on internal storage. Or your going to get a pre owned phone at a discounted price  say $100-400 depending on condition of the device. So in reality you are spending the same if not more when doing the 2yr.
Sprint,3cp5cu,Guy_Gerricault,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:33:40 2015 UTC,"If you break a phone under lease you are doing the same thing lol. You break a leased phone after 10 months you still have to buy a phone at MSRP, used phone or pay off all of your lease payments and your buyout option and then still do lease or easy pay on a device (5 days later).  Now let's assume your 14 year old cracks their iPhone screen like every bit of half the teenagers do. Phone still works but the screen is cracked. No big deal I bought it subsidized in two years I'll get a new One and try not to crack it. Or I'll get it repaired with 3rd party parts from the kid around the corner for $70 bucks whatever no big deal. Oops I leased it instead. Now I am legally bound to turn a phone in that is in good working condition. Guess I'm out $200 because the only option I have is to get it replaced under insurance which is $200 or use my buy out option at the end which is $200. No matter how you shake it, if you break a phone or crack a screen the lease will end up costing you more. Every. Time."

Without knowledge of your area i can only give you general reasons as to why.   I would suggest calling into care to report the issue.  1: antennas normally have 3 sectors, its possible you are in the null of 2 of those sectors, or none of the sectors are facing you at all.  2: geogrphaical reasons such as building blocking line of site from the closest tower, or terrtain such as hills. It could also be that you are higher elevation then the tower closest to you, causing the tower to undershoot your current location.  3: the tower is actually having issues hardware wise, or performance wise that require further investigation.  Sometimes due to terrain or other external factors you wont always be talking to the closest tower.  As i stated above however, i think that calling care would be yoiu best bet into getting your issue resolved."

Sprint,3cnyh8,lilotimz,3,Thu Jul 9 12:48:04 2015 UTC,Its essentially multi carrier LTE giving twice your normal data LTE speeds. I believe testing we have done so far says median is estimated to be around 50-60mbps but peak is about 150ish mbps.  There are however a limited number of devices capable of support CA.
Sprint,3cnyh8,sparkedman,2,Thu Jul 9 12:56:35 2015 UTC,"Theoretically it's ~160/17 but one never to that theoretical in live conditions anyhow but close enough given that it's intraband adjacent carrier aggregation and the RSRP differences are very very similar.  Now when they shut down Wimax at last and change the time configurations to downlink dominant since wimax won't interfere with TDD-LTE anymore.... oh boy. 200 mbps easy with 2xCA with individual carriers reaching 100 mbps at the expense of uplink speeds.   CA capable devices are the Moto device just certified a few days ago (moto x 2015?), GS6, GS6e, GNe, LG G Flex 2, LG G4, and HTC One m9."

Sprint,3cm5kp,B1GEast,3,Thu Jul 9 01:09:09 2015 UTC,Hard to say how things would have turned out without the Softbank bailout. You have to make judgements based on the data available and Sprint was in fact circling the drain in 2012 (Network Vision would have bankrupted Sprint based on spending). Marcelo isn't concerned because they now have financial backing and the option to sell spectrum. That of course doesn't matter if investors don't see growth over the next few quarters.

""The idea is you've a much better cost structure to operate off,"" he said. While Clement noted there were risks that the network upgrade would not work out as planned, ""My view is that it's a decent bet they can pull it off.""  CreditSights analyst Ping Zhao expects Sprint's credit profile to deteriorate as its spending needs increase. But even if it runs into difficulties, the company could stave off bankruptcy by raising more money in capital markets, Zhao said. ""I don't believe in the next couple of years they're going to be even close to bankruptcy,"" Zhao said. ""They can and do have the capacity to issue secured debt."""

Keep in mind that after 9/30/2016, an access fee of $15/month per line will be added to your monthly bill.  Depending on your data needs for the smartphones, you might also want to consider the Best Buy One Family Plan:   $100/month for the first 2 lines and $40/month for each additional line: Unlimited Talk/Text/Data.   This plan may also still be available in a Sprint store as it was previously offered by Sprint. Call to verify if you have interest.

There are other promotions and discounts that may, but having TEP is not one of those things (I guess unless the store is personally running one where they waive it if you get TEP, but if that's the case I'd get that stuff in writing/notated on the account). Also TEP+ just has some extra features but not actually any additional device coverage over regular TEP (which is $11 or less depending on device)."
Sprint,3cjiew,praemonitus_,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:48:27 2015 UTC,"In addition to what others have said, I would suggest looking at other ways go get your phones. Buying used from Swappa.com is a great way to save money in the long run. There are good prices on there for most phones you would want. You'd be able to get basic (non-smart) phones on there for much less than in a store.   Buying iPhones at full cost from Apple or Nexus devices from Google is more expensive upfront, but you will OWN the phones without a commitment to Sprint. If you have the money, I would suggest that. It will also help you move away from the mindset of ""a phone is $ every two years"" and put you in control of how long you stay with a company. A Nexus 6 or iPhone 6 for Sprint (once unlocked) can be activated on pretty much all of the US carriers. Without ETFs or lease/installment balances hanging over your head, you'll feel more empowered to switch if Sprint doesn't make you happy, AND you won't have to repurchase phones (unless you go to Verizon)."

Sprint,3cg7xi,lilotimz,3,Tue Jul 7 21:08:40 2015 UTC,"@OP A little more detail at why everyone is telling you now..  Basically Samsung made two different models for T-mobile and Sprint. T-mobiles model supports specifically T-mobiles LTE Bands which are 2/4/12 and then WCDMA (HSPA) and GSM. For Sprint Samsung made a model that supports Sprints LTE bands (25/26/41) AND the CCA (competitive carrier association) bands (2/4/5/12) which belong to small regional entities that are going under the umbrella of Sprint in order to acquire devices and upgrade their networks.   For Sprints model Samsung included CDMA band class 0/1/10 for Sprint and small carriers, LTE Bands 2/4/5/12/25/26/41 so everyones LTE bands are supported, in addition to WCDMA (HSPA), and GSM so the smaller non CDMA entities are also covered and for international roaming purposes.   This makes it so that if you unlock a Sprint S6 you can take it to ATT or Tmobile since it already supports their 2G / 3G or 4G networks (band 2/4/5/ maybe 12 if ATT has MFBI enabled) whereas the other way is not true since ATT or T-mobiles devices does not supports Sprints LTE bands (25/26/41) or the CDMA 1x or EVDO 3G technology."

Sprint,3cbofn,steinkopf,13,Mon Jul 6 17:38:53 2015 UTC,"There's always been a deductible for cracked screens, liquid damage, and lost/stolen claims. It's anywhere from $50-$200 depending on which phone you have Repair stores can fix anything that's not costing a deductible. Your charge port doesn't work? Let's get you a new charge port. Your camera fails? Let's get you a new camera. Sometimes we have to order a replacement phone sometimes we can fix it, it depends on what the problem is, how bad it is, how we can fix it/how hard it is to fix it, what parts we can get, etc. All phones given through Asurion insurance are refurbished. Sometimes they give new phones, but that's typically only when a phone is too new for refurbished models to exist (in other words, assume you'll get refurbished because 99% of the time you will). After an insurance claim is filed you CAN swap out phones. When they said they couldn't activate your S3 they were wrong. At my store, we typically help the customer file a claim, then immediately activate an old backup phone for the customer to use in the mean time. Insurance claims are non-refundable. They did make an agreement with you, but this is the rare exception. Sprint, AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile all use Asurion, so keep in mind that had this incident happened at another carrier the outcome will most likely have been the same.   Insurance is great for liquid damage and lost or stolen. It's not as good for screen cracks. That said, before you go to a 3rd party repair store, remember one thing. If they screw up, they will typically not take responsibility, and it can void your warranty. I.E. if you have a manufacturer defect AND a screen crack, getting a shoddy repaid job will still leave you stuck. If you really want to make sure you're fine, always go with Asurion. If there's a problem with them they will take care of it, and if they can't Sprint will."
Sprint,3cbofn,Heznarrt,5,Mon Jul 6 18:05:23 2015 UTC,"Awesome post that clearly states all the important points. Part of Sprint's contract with Apple makes them the only one of the 4 major carriers (I believe this is still true) that can actually process warranty work. Service and Repair stores have access to GSX tests and some other tools that were exclusive to Apple. While repair techs can take other phones apart they are contractually obliged to only triage Apple products. If your charging port or headphone port breaks they dont fix the phone you get a replacement. This is not the case if you have a Galaxy s4 for example, which is repairable."
Sprint,3cbofn,3WordPosts,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:34:03 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to take a second to thank you for this clarification. I know I probably sounded a bit aggravated in my original post, but it was just such a hassle with all the phone calls and useless trips I had to make.  The deductible thing makes sense and wasn't really my biggest issue. I still believe a repair store should carry screens for a phone because that seems to be the most common issue and would increase the turnaround time. The fact that the store I went to didn't give out loaner phones and that I was told I couldn't use my S3 must have been their mistake then.  Since I'm pretty dependent on my phone to make money I went with the repair and got it all settled today. The place that does it around here is very professional and screwing customers over would tarnish their reputation which is why I wasn't worried about that.  The reason I'm getting a refund on the insurance claim is that I was not told it wasn't refundable. If I had been told ""all sales are final"" then I would have understood, but that simply wasn't the case in my situation.  Thanks again for the clarification - it helped quite a bit."

The do for a lot of different phones, certain phones cannot be opened in store however. Any liquid-resistant device is prohibited from being opened in store because they cannot properly seal it again to the required specifications. The Galaxy S5 is just one of those devices.

Sprint,3cbofn,halcyoncmdr,2,Tue Jul 7 05:34:01 2015 UTC,"Unless the corporate policy changed after March 2014 (and all new equipment was sent out to every S&R store to properly seal these devices), you're likely violating policy and potentially damaging customer devices. While it is double sided tape that holds the screen in (just like 99% of devices on the market), it is specifically designed to make a watertight seal when heat treated in the factory, meeting the IP67 specification.  I would never trust a field repaired IP-rated device to be properly sealed against dust and liquid, it's why the Sprint policy was not to even attempt to open them up (even to check for liquid damage internally, corrosion, etc. that would voice in-store coverage).  Any employee can double check in the corporate knowledge base to look at the proper M&Ps for liquid-resistant devices. I'd be willing to bet they didn't simply decide to change that policy.  My current independent repair shop has the proper equipment for sealing these devices again, and we still don't guarantee the same IP67 seal because it's simply not possible to do in a field repair. There is no way to field test it to ensure it is actually sealed properly without throwing it in a pool of water."
Sprint,3cbofn,radrake13,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:05:17 2015 UTC,It really will vary by location unfortunately... At least as far as screen repair goes. Out service locations can replace cracked screens as long as they have the particular screen available.

I either  have items delivered to my work or the second is to have the item held at UPS, then I am able to just go there afterwards and pick it up."

Sounds more like an update for legal reasons  This is important because if a customer did a hard reset on a device that had the activation lock on it and did not remove their gmail account before hand they were forced to enter their entire gmail and password prior to reactivation. There is no workaround if a customer does not know their gmail information so it is important to remove that before hard resetting.

Sprint,3cbf5l,FigMcLargeHuge,6,Mon Jul 6 16:30:18 2015 UTC,Yes in port you are using your plan but on the cruise ship you are using the very limited service.  I did a behind the scenes tour and saw that each crew member gets limited access to the Internet and has to pay for anything over that amount.  This is all over the place and a simple trip to the front desk could have verified that it wasn't covered.    Essentially the cruise ship is selling the minutes to sprint then sprint is marking them up to you.
Sprint,3cbf5l,takedownchris,-1,Mon Jul 6 16:49:48 2015 UTC,"It's infuriating enough to make you want to switch companies, but then every company is just as [bleeped] up as this one. So I would probably be jumping from one fire over to another. Thanks though."
Sprint,3cbf5l,takmsdsm,3,Mon Jul 6 17:00:11 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter what carrier you are with. When you are on the ocean, the ship is your carrier. All carriers roam on the cruise ships cell towers, and its their rates you are using. These notices are up on cruise ships that offer this service.    If you are cruising, do not turn on your phone or leave in airplane mode until you are off the ship at port, and at least a few 1000' away.  It should connect to the local towers at that point, and your international plan will be in play."
Sprint,3cbf5l,takmsdsm,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:31:41 2015 UTC,"That would have been pretty handy to know about a month ago. The cruise I went on recently did not have the capability as I had no service once we left port. My phone was merely an alarm clock at that point (which btw I was completely fine with. I didn't go on a cruise to be tied to my phone). I sure wish the Sprint lady setting up the international roaming would have mentioned this. And I know she didn't because I asked her twice if she was correct about the free international text and data, and she reconfirmed. I knew I was right to be skeptical, I just didn't ask the right questions."
Sprint,3cbf5l,swintec,2,Mon Jul 6 17:55:37 2015 UTC,Did you ask about specifically about using on cruise ships? They are not domestic OR international really. They are their own thing.

Sprint,3calqh,OMG_its_JasonE,2,Mon Jul 6 19:56:59 2015 UTC,"On the subsidized plans, if I remember correctly, they tack on data access fees that are stupid high.

Sprint,3c8fdf,deathsnuggle,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:38:53 2015 UTC,"From Sprint's own page on unlocking:   Generally, if you have a device that was launched prior to February 2015 and it is capable of being unlocked, Sprint will provide a bill notification and/or text message when you are eligible to have your device unlocked. The bill notification will direct you to Sprint Customer Care who can assist in efforts to unlock your device.  For domestic SIM unlockable (""DSU"") devices launched after February 2015, Sprint will automatically unlock the device when it becomes eligible.  For inactive devices, customers must contact Sprint Customer Care to request that their DSU-capable device be unlocked and may have to take steps to perform an over-the-air update to ensure the unlock programming has been relayed to the device.   Unfortunately if the UICC Unlock option isn't working the only people who can help are customer service. My recommendation is to call them back, ask for a supervisor, and request a ticket be made for the back office team to unlock it. It might take a couple more days, but they're typically the people who can fix escalating issues such as this. If you go with this, can you please report back in a couple days with an update?"

Sprint,3c8fdf,UnicornManlyTears,2,Mon Jul 6 05:42:48 2015 UTC,The galaxy s5 won't be unlocked to be honest. They will give you the MSL and imply that you should get it flashed to another carrier. The only unlock care can do for an S5 is an international unlock whether it's active or inactive. Source: I work in international department.

Your best bet is to see if you can return the phone to the seller for a refund, or see if you can sell it to someone else who is on Sprint and an unlock wouldn't be necessary.

Sprint,3c5w78,MrNagant,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:06:49 2015 UTC,Technically they become sprints property but most managers can make an exception for you. Even if the phones were sent back they can actually request the phones back but it does cost like $25 or something like that and takes a little bit of time for the buyback company to process them. Assuming they are in store still I see no reason why they can't Return them to You although your data is probably gone. You have 14 days to return merchandise and cancel service with sprint (or port back out to another carrier) so if it truly is a service issue you will want to do that asap.

Now, had they just been honest, added the phone to their system, and informed you it might not work as well as you'd hope, they would have been better off.  Either way, it doesn't matter what carrier you use, the sales people are always going to be looking out for their best interest, not yours.

Even if the rep did know they COULD activate your phone, they were trying to get you to do what was in your best interest."

Sprint,3c2zhu,Fluffy_Fox,5,Sat Jul 4 07:13:19 2015 UTC,"The additional rebate is supposed to mean that they're getting an early upgrade option for only IB/lease. There has definitely been some confusion about this, it seemed like it was presented as an issue within the last couple days, and when I tried to get clarification on if this is a temporary thing or if we will ever have a workaround, my sup wasn't sure. I am interested in seeing what happens when they're actually eligible (I know you said this is affecting people who aren't in contract anymore but I haven't personally seen that yet). I work in NSS and had an account that would be normally eligible for their 2 year service agreement on 08/01/2015, but they had the additional rebate that would allow them to upgrade this month. I'd like to know what will happen for that customer on 08/01/2015."
Sprint,3c2zhu,paperbanjo,3,Sat Jul 4 09:11:20 2015 UTC,"Id like to confirm this, I have yet to see customers who are out of contract be effected by this. I have even done a few 2 year contracts over the past few days with customers who were out of contract so this is certainly not the case with every account.  Like yourself, I did have customers who were still a few months out unable to do their upgrade and only have ib/lease options but who know what will happen when their contract is up.  (I did have someone with NSS try and manually do the upgrade on their side, still showed the same rebate ((or lack their of)) amount and then she pushed it through anyway and reset eligibility. I don't think she'll be doing that again however as she probably realized that wasnt the best workaround)"

Sprint,3c2zhu,Cognitivel0gic,2,Sat Jul 4 20:47:36 2015 UTC,"Simple solution... A decent case, glass screen protector and a little care go along way."
Sprint,3c2zhu,3WordPosts,3,Sun Jul 5 01:20:16 2015 UTC,"This is not a practical solution for every customer. A lot of families use old devices as ""hand me downs"" for their kids. No one in their right mind would willingly lease a device for their Tweens or even some teens. Kids will break phones. It's going to happen. The ability to have phones floating around to use as temporary devices or give to your little one As a ""stater phone"" is important to a lot of people. Hell I have adults that go through 5+ phones in a year."
Sprint,3c2zhu,Cognitivel0gic,2,Sun Jul 5 01:34:38 2015 UTC,"That is the way the industry is going. What are ""these customers"" going to do when 2 year upgrades are no longer an option at all?   92% of the devices sold from my location are leased devices just over 7% financed and 1% 2 year pricing.   These parents understand kids break things. They purchase life proof and otter box cases to prevent damage as much as possible. They are also willing to pay the additional costs to have TEP for the occasions those options fail."
Sprint,3c2zhu,3WordPosts,3,Sun Jul 5 02:19:24 2015 UTC,"And the reason you sell such a high number of leases? It's not because every customer is so happy and thinks leasing is the future. Let's be honest, that's what sprint or your district manager or store manager or quota is requiring. I guess if you are in a store that makes 1.5 sales per lease and only cares about those metrics of course that is going to be the driving sale.  Are you confident that 90% of the customers that leave your store with leases are left with the best option for them? Sounds more likely it was either the only real option presented or the option they were deceived into believing was their best option. Let me guess Is TEP plus your only sell as well because the U.S. Based tech support and 20gb of backup storage is necessary for every customer from an Alcatel one touch to an iPhone 6 Plus power user."
Sprint,3c2zhu,Cognitivel0gic,2,Sun Jul 5 02:28:52 2015 UTC,My location is in a high prime customer area that 80% of the phones sold are iPhones. iPhone customers typically upgrade their devices every two years if not every year so the option to pay $0 upfront for a device save a bit of money monthly and flip the device out at the end of the term is a perfect solution for them.   The one touch also isn't eligible for either $11 or $13 TEP option FYI.
Sprint,3c2zhu,3WordPosts,3,Sun Jul 5 02:39:25 2015 UTC,"I'm right there with you in our location I think we were like 77% iPhone since last August with the 5s promo they were running. Yes I am aware the Alcatel does not get the $11 or $13 tep. Maybe I should have went with the lumina, vigor, or some other budget phone. I think you get my point though. Every customer and every situation is unique. The 50 year old housewife who gets a 6+ because all her girlfriends have one and keeps it in her purse all day with no risk of breaking it is perfect for the lease. The 16 year old kid with his 4th cracked screen and no case is NOT a great candidate for a lease or loyalty lease and frankly trying to pressure someone into that is irresponsible as a sales person.  I'm not trying to come off as abrasive and apologize because I know this is worded harshly. But telling someone to buy a case and get insurance is not a legitimate sales tactic when you know that in two years these phones have to be turned in with no physical damage. You are creating huge opportunities for churn. Hell since you are in a high prime area you could even change your sales pitch to demonstrate the value a customer gets by doing easy pay. As soon as their current device is paid off they can get a new one. No need to worry about 2 yr commitments or turning phones in that work. You want the iPhone 7 next year? Easy just pay off your IB balance and next week come in and we'll get you set up with that iPhone 7."

Sprint,3c2zhu,Heznarrt,4,Mon Jul 6 11:38:48 2015 UTC,"I am an employee at a corporate store, and we can still do 2 year contracts on upgrades and new lines of service. In fact I performed a contract upgrade for a customer a few hours ago.  I'm not surprised that some (if not all) preferred/authorized retailers are unable to do 2 year contracts however. I used to work for a preferred retailer before I moved to corporate and it was clear that IBs were worth way more than contracts were, I'm just amazed it took them this long to stop offering contracts outright."
Sprint,3c2zhu,3WordPosts,3,Sun Jul 5 04:35:07 2015 UTC,"This looks to be more of a system glitch currently than anything else. I'm not sure on the corporate side how your system is showing certain customers but I would assume it is the same way. A lot of customers are showing 7/1 retail discount eligible (a new message) which is not the same as a 2 year eligibility. Looks like it was simply supposed to be a way to make it clear the customer, while still under contract- was able to lease or easy pay early. Something goofy however is occurring that a lot of customers are showing this new eligibility that reps are mistakenly confusing with 2yr"
Sprint,3c2zhu,Heznarrt,2,Sun Jul 5 04:41:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah at corporate we see two messages. One for their upgrade date if they lease or choose IB, and one for their upgrade date if they choose a contract.  A few weeks ago Sprint moved everyone with a  2 year contract to a full 24 month wait between upgrades, rather than the 20 month wait before. As such, people who were close to upgrade eligible, or already were, were all of a sudden pushed back by 4 months, causing a general sadness for customers who all of a sudden have to wait longer, and thus have made lease/IB the only option for some who cannot wait to upgrade for whatever reasons they have.  Looks like it's just now hitting preferred/authorized retailers."
Sprint,3c2zhu,3WordPosts,3,Sun Jul 5 04:44:17 2015 UTC,"No I'm fully aware of that whole fiasco. This is actually a completely new issue that started 7/1. We see the same things as you guys in regards to eligibility, basically this is a third line of text claiming the customer is also eligible for an additional rebate (similar to a lot of CL accounts that often show 3 times of text instead of the standard ib/lease Line and two year line if you know what I'm talking about) the problem is when you try and push the upgrade through it Only gives the customer a $34 rebate instead of the $450 rebate and a contract renewal. a lot of reps are seeing it shows additional rebate and trying to process it as a 2yr (or care reps telling customers they are eligible for 2 years months ahead of time). I had a customer today actually who still had 9 months on their contract insist on doing a 2yr because a Care agent mistakenly told her she was eligible after reading this new screen."
Sprint,3c2zhu,Heznarrt,3,Sun Jul 5 05:08:14 2015 UTC,Ahh. I was seeing the $34 rebate option with the normal $0 rebate (aka buying phone full retail) and $450 rebate option (or whatever the rebate happens to be for said phone). You guys are only getting the $34 option? Weird. That's definitely a system error as corporate stores aren't facing it.

If one was fortunate, lucky, savvy, educated enough--as many were--to get on a plan that is a fair price, then losing the subsidy on a contract to go to a no-contract model is a tremendous downgrade.   It's the people that switch around often, don't do the math required, or are comfortable buying and holding on to a phone for more than two years that tend to benefit most from the ""uncarrier"" model."

I'm not on a 10 year old Sprint plan because I was on my parent's Verizon plan 10 years ago.   if you got a fantastic deal because of a discount or old promotion years ago, you're not going to have it forever, that's just a fact of life, do you think they should provide a bad deal for new customers so you and others can cling to their old deals? is that fair? your 1 incident of a 'great contract experience' is up against the dozen horrible experiences of unexpected billing or fees or charges other people are constantly reporting. all I can think about is someone walking into a 3rd party Sprint store, being talked into a contract, only to figure out they offer better/less expensive deals. that makes for a terrible customer experience."
Sprint,3c2zhu,rebelx,2,Sat Jul 4 22:35:36 2015 UTC,"Definitely--however, the blanket statement from the OP ""Are you saying Sprint is doing away with 2 year contracts? Awesome!"" is equally as disturbing and applicable to your present post.  There are more people remaining on their plans/carrier than there are churning away. A small, but very vocal minority, actually choose to leave their carrier/change their plan. This is to whom the new plans cater to--not those that have remained loyal (or in some cases: laziness, but the effect is the same).   The best course of action here isn't to penalize those that stayed with their cellular companies through thick or thin, but rather, to offer additional choices and options so that everyone has the ability to select what's best for them.  Your plan now must obviously be ""bad"" enough to where purchasing a phone outright and not being on contract makes sense to you. This does not apply to me. The correct solution is to offer contracts, lease, or financing options so that the majority of customers are covered.   And as for ""your 1 incident of a 'great contract experience' is meaningless against the dozen horrible experiences of unexpected billing or fees or charges other people are constantly reporting,"" I completely disagree. I can throw the same analogy back to you: your being on your parents' plan 10 years ago and having to pay more now should not have a bearing on my plan status now. Sure, I've had billing issues with Sprint years ago, but none in the past 3-4 years. That's obviously anecdotal evidence, but it applies to me, just as your experience applies to you. Keep in mind that people that are unhappy are going to vocalize their displeasure significantly more than those that are satisfied with the service they receive. When was the last time you saw a post here on this sub that said ""Wow, Sprint is the best! Great coverage, great price, great phones!"" Probably never, even though it applies to a lot of people out there."

If a person was truly displeased with the service they received at a third party store, why do business there? Go elsewhere.

The payment is the same and frankly without getting technical, an activation with a 2yr is actually more risky for a store than an IB or lease due to the risk of deactivation. There are however sometimes where a 2yr may make more sense. I'll give you a scenario where a customer runs an account, gets approved for 2 lines and is interested in getting an iPhone 6.  Now with easy pay the customer may need to pay $400 plus dollars up front. Yes that means their monthly cost will be dramatically less for their phone but not every customer is In a position to drop $400+ up front. This is translated further with more than one line. They could however purchase the iPhone 6 with a 2yr for $200 and in their mind go with a much more affordable option despite paying more monthly. Just some food for thought."
Sprint,3c2zhu,bestnameever,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:43:00 2015 UTC,"The fact is that carriers want to end subsidies because it is costing them money.  If you price the old T-Mobile plans compared to what they offer now with the cost of the phone, they actually cost more over a two year period than before.  There were similar complaints once sprint started offering easy pay.   Everyone's usage is different though so some benefit under the new model."

I have some drop call issues still in a couple areas when driving through but now its more the exception than the rule and I'm noticing small incremental improvements in some areas.  The canyons for instance now have LTE when two years ago you couldn't even bring up a web page.  We should have LTE on band 26 (i think) later this year which will be great for data service.  I'd wait to talk to corporate and see what they say...Maybe they will use your feedback to adjust some towers or something.  In my experience, while not always the case, Sprint customer service has really gone the extra mile in some instances.  I once reported a bad time on the network for instance and ended up receiving like 3 follow up calls within a few hours while they were troubleshooting the issue.

Sprint,3c0alq,Reddog740,2,Fri Jul 3 17:35:53 2015 UTC,Sprint has many account types one of them is corporate. I believe you can be consider corporate if you sign up for a discount through your employer. So it doesn't have to be that your employer gives you a phone to be consider corporate.   I'm not 100% sure since I don't deal with any of that in my job function so please correct me if I'm wrong
Sprint,3c0alq,halcyoncmdr,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:01:45 2015 UTC,"An employee discount does not qualify a line as ""corporate"". The confusion comes because the discount requires changing the account type to a corporate hierarchy, so both Sprint and the company know which accounts are attached to that hierarchy. Being attached to a corporate hierarchy has no bearing on any of the ""corporate"" perks or limitations that a true business account would have, they are treated exactly like a standard individual account."
Sprint,3c0alq,hectorartm,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:15:26 2015 UTC,"We get special discounts through FedEx Express by going contract on my way and my all in plans (they are still on our FedEx branded Sprint website).  The contracts are definitely cheaper than you can get through Sprint.  Plus, they automatically apply corporate discount.  I go through Sprint corporate to make changes, but can also use regular CS.  So I don't know if that's different, just noting.  Edit:  oh and I have Google voice integration."

Sprint,3c1fga,Heznarrt,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:01:19 2015 UTC,"If you are on a leasing agreement, then you'll have to either turn the phone in or pay the buyout (between $200-$350 depending on how long your lease term is)  If you're doing Easy Pay Financing, you'll have to pay off your remaining balance whenever you choose to leave (although if your 2 year financing is up in October then your remaining balance would be $0). If you choose to leave before you finish financing, then the amount remaining will be charged to you through a final bill. You can buyback your phone at a corporate store towards this amount however.  If you're on a 2 year contract, then you'll have to pay an early termination fee but keep the phone (although you can buyback the phone at a corporate store towards your bill to hlep offset the cost). If you have a 2 year contract and the contract is up in October, then you'll be able to cancel and leave without paying anything and keep your phone."

He first worked in telecommunications at New England Telephone. Legere then spent nearly twenty years at AT&T, where he spent a period working under Daniel Hesse, formerly CEO of Sprint Corporation. He served as chief executive for AT&T Asia from April 1994 to November 1997, and also spent time as head of AT&T Global Strategy and Business Development. From 1997 to 1998, he served as President of Worldwide outsourcing of AT&T solutions.   ICYMI: Read this about his ""makeover""....   Legere’s official debut came four months into his tenure, at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January 2013. He had already started to loosen up his wardrobe now that his customers were millennials and not milquetoast CIOs. ""Open coat, nice collared shirt"" is how Legere’s longtime friend David Carey, T-Mobile’s EVP for corporate services, describes Legere’s first steps toward finding the clothes that would make the man. ""It was very Silicon Valley–like,"" he says.  But Legere began to worry he still looked like too much of a suit. ""We were up in the suite,"" Carey says, recalling the night before T-Mobile’s press event at CES, ""and he said, ‘What should I wear?’ And I said, ‘I don’t know, look at me. What the hell are you asking me for?’ "" The two fiftysomething dudes bantered for a bit, until Carey suggested ""this cool hipster kind of sport coat that he had just gotten."" Legere was receptive but still flummoxed. ""What shirt?"" he asked. Carey told him, ""I’m not a fashion guy, but I think you’re supposed to wear one of those T-shirt kinda things to get that cool look going.""  Legere came up with a twist. What if it was a magenta T-shirt with a giant T on it? Vegas, baby, Vegas. They had the T-shirt made overnight.  When he showed up at the Venetian hotel the next day for his first public introduction to the technology industry as T-Mobile’s new CEO, Legere had accessorized the hip sport-coat-over-a-T-shirt look with a dangling silver chain and a chunky white plastic watch.

Sprint,3bubpb,mitten_mike,0,Thu Jul 2 06:17:28 2015 UTC,Actually we do tell them it goes up
Sprint,3bubpb,Kellendippel1,2,Thu Jul 2 09:09:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you might, your store might, your area might. You can't speak for all of the retail employees at both corporate and third-party locations nationwide. In the wireless retail world with commission-based sales you're always going to have bad apples that will roll the dice to get sales.  I see people talk online about Sprint employees not telling them something (I'm sure a decent portion of the time the employee did tell them, they just weren't really listening) but we never had that issue at any of the stores I worked at over my 7 years with the company in corporate retail. At least not a legitimate claim of it, we had people say they weren't told by Customer Care, but the notes in the account stated specifically that the care rep told them."

Sprint,3bubpb,halcyoncmdr,2,Thu Jul 2 05:40:24 2015 UTC,"Legere tries to hard to be that quirky other guy then you see how T-Mobile really is. Personally, I've always like Claure, seems like a chill guy that seems to be taking Sprint in the right direction QUIETLY. I feel like the best way a carrier can attract people is 1) Phone availability (not an issue with almost all flagships launching on all networks) 2) Price and 3) (most import) network strength and coverage. And I've seen huge improvements under Claure that I hope continue, again, quietly without that anti-carrier bullshit."
Sprint,3bubpb,afiresword,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:14:44 2015 UTC,"his shtick is getting really old honestly. he acts like 'the cool uncle' giving away candy for free, then turns around and caps unlimited data, copies Sprint (and AT&T) despite ripping on them all the time, and pulls shifty pricing like Claure pointed out. he's spent weeks and weeks trying to get the FCC to help him out because he is incapable of obtaining funding for their network expansion. the guy is a joke of a CEO.  that being said, I hope Claure keeps his professional composure and doesn't let the Sprint network improvements go to his head. he seems like a great CEO, I doubt he'll sink to Legere's level, nothing wrong with sticking up for yourself every now and then though."
Sprint,3bubpb,mitten_mike,5,Thu Jul 2 06:07:28 2015 UTC,"Unlimited data caps? Is that similar to the 600Kbps bandwidth cap Sprint tried to get away with implementing?  T-Mobile's 21GB soft cap is a QoS implementation that only applies to congested towers. If you have used more than 21GB, you may be throttled if your phone joins a contested tower. It doesn't mean you will always be throttled.  Furthermore: T-Mobile's tactics may be unusual but they get shit done. T-Mobile has deployed VoLTE in a majority in their markets, while Sprint is still thinking about how to do it."

Sprint,3bubpb,sparkedman,2,Thu Jul 2 17:23:43 2015 UTC,"I think I remember Wheeler talking about roaming agreements (alongside interconnection agreements for wireline, the rough equivalent) and how he though the large corporate giants might be actively trying to block smaller competitors from the market by charging higher amounts, simply so it wouldn't be affordable to the smaller companies. Based on recent FCC decisions, it's not a far stretch to think that may be where the FCC heads next."
Sprint,3bubpb,halcyoncmdr,5,Thu Jul 2 18:01:14 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah... welcome to telecommunications. Does the origin of their spectrum/network somehow determine the worthiness of the carrier?  AT&T and Verizon received a good portion of their spectrum for next to nothing from the FCC back in the 1980's. How dare T-Mobile receive spectrum from AT&T and buy it from Verizon! Those dirty bastards, right?"

Sprint,3bw0uq,rbe15,3,Thu Jul 2 17:59:07 2015 UTC,The end price to own the phone should be exactly the same whether you do Lease or Easy Pay.

Sprint,3bw0uq,mitten_mike,3,Thu Jul 2 17:49:35 2015 UTC,OP needs 4 lines... so that would make the monthly line price $180/month.

Edit: Why does the FCC prohibit amplifiers on these bands in the first place anyway?
Sprint,3bud5y,B1GEast,3,Thu Jul 2 05:49:50 2015 UTC,"If I had to guess, it could be because of border issues with Mexico and Canada on 800mhz. Not sure about 2.5ghz."

Sprint,3bud5y,13bmoses,2,Fri Jul 3 14:23:49 2015 UTC,i have an older wilson sleek that isn't even supposed to work with sprints 4G but it does boost both B25 and B26. however i haven't been able to find anything that works with B41. I can find antennas that pick up those frequencies but nothing that actually amplifies them.....  which sucks because at my work i'm in a metal building which already kills B26 pretty bad so my chances of getting a B41 signal once it gets installed is next to nothing :(
Sprint,3bud5y,sparkedman,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:55:35 2015 UTC,"Unless I'm mistaken, this repeater and this repeater seem to support Bands 25 and 26. Not sure about Band 41."
Sprint,3bud5y,nk1,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:09:20 2015 UTC,So Sprint is moving towards an altered European network model according to them. High density/high capacity in the 2.5/2.6 GHz range and enhanced coverage on the 800 MHz band (but with 26 instead of 20).
Sprint,3brxqz,ghostinator1,6,Wed Jul 1 17:40:05 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's CA. It's being pushed out everywhere there is band 41 2nd carrier."
Sprint,3brxqz,evan1123,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:43:41 2015 UTC,Is there a map for this or anything?
Sprint,3brxqz,VileDevastation,3,Wed Jul 1 18:09:32 2015 UTC,AFAIK there isn't one.  Due to backhaul demands it's also generally on a cell site by cell site case with some having the 2nd Band 41 carrier and doing CA and others only having the bandwith to support a single Band 41 carrier which means the site would not be doing CA.   So the only real easy way of tracking it is to identify the original band 41 carrier EARFCN and keep an eye out for any other B41 EARFCNs like 40978 and then 41176. One can even get more fancy and look for the GCI patterns but that's beyond the scope of many.
Sprint,3brxqz,lilotimz,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:30:03 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info.
Sprint,3brxqz,VileDevastation,2,Wed Jul 1 18:33:01 2015 UTC,No problem!
Sprint,3brxqz,lilotimz,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:34:19 2015 UTC,"Why would backhaul be an issue?  CA doesn't increase the capability of the site, just allows 1 device to access more of it at a time.  Correct?  I would assume the backhaul already exceeds the cellular capability.  That being said, how do they backhaul these things?"
Sprint,3brxqz,DBordello,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:34:58 2015 UTC,Each carrier orders the backhaul for their present and immediate future needs. Sprints requirements were for 2 to three 5 mhz FDD-LTE carriers when it was ordered back in 2011-2014 with only a few select sites having additional capabiliy ordered because they were going to do hotspot type Band 41 deployments and not the mass 8T8R deployments they're doing now.   Thus the backhaul companies fulfilled that order of 2-3 FDD-LTE carriers (approx 200-300 mbps) and deployed the equipment and lines capable of just that speed because they're not going to spend more money for more capable backhaul equipment if the entity does not order it.   When the 2.5 deployment began in 2014 backaul orders once again went out the backhaul companies to increase the backhaul. Some were AAV backhaul lines were already maxed out and new lines need to be ordered which takes a long time once again. Others were fiber optic with FTUs only specified for the 200-300 mbps range as Sprint originally requested. Needs to be replaced and generally these are the quickest ones to be done. Others are microwave and generally can also be done quickly but need the feeder site bandwith capability to be increased.  Generally speaking about a quarter of live sites today already have the prerequisite ~1gig backhaul needed for the 2-3 5 mhz FDD LTE carriers + 2 20 mhz TDD-LTE carriers. The other 50% got estimated to be done by end of year with the rest being indeterminate due to difficulties with BH vendors (how surprising..).
Sprint,3brxqz,lilotimz,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:45:06 2015 UTC,"Very interesting.  Thank you for the detailed description.    With CA, are we adding another 20 mhz TDD-LTE carrier, or just allowing devices to access both?"
Sprint,3brxqz,DBordello,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:17:57 2015 UTC,Sprint is adding another 20 mhz TDD-LTE carrier and enabling aditional LTE-A technologies like carrier aggregation. Sprint previously only had a single 20 mhz TDD-LTE carrier live.

Sprint,3bscdy,halcyoncmdr,3,Thu Jul 2 02:12:29 2015 UTC,"Interesting...  Even though it's an ""s"" model, the development cycle of the iPhone 6s is quite long I'm sure, and was probably started and spec defined well before this News Release.  There also have to be enough of them available for Apple's production requirements. We're talking tens of millions of chips. Perhaps the tooling isn't in place to make this in sufficient quantities.  There's always iPhone 7. On the other hand, this leak could be complete BS and we're in for a pleasant surprise...  Apple is pretty stubborn when it comes to defining specs in its mobile devices. Take the iPhone 5s, which should have had Band 41 support but didn't. The iPad mini 3 should have had Band 41 support but didn't. They do what they want I guess."
Sprint,3bscdy,abcgeek,3,Thu Jul 2 10:58:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, I am sure it is the length of the design and testing phases. The 6S would have been in development long before November of 2014, I am sure they were working on it before they released the 6/6+. It usually takes 3 to 6 mos for Sprint to certify the module also after QC hands over the product for testing."
Sprint,3bscdy,Vtrossi,2,Thu Jul 2 12:53:07 2015 UTC,"So is Apple's development cycle longer than other manufacturers?  Perhaps, it has to do with timing, given that the iPhone is released in the fall of every year. Other manufacturers seem to release phones whenever they want throughout the year. Apple seems to stick with its fall timetable, and is willing to wait to incorporate it in the next product iteration."
Sprint,3bscdy,abcgeek,2,Thu Jul 2 12:59:07 2015 UTC,"Apple's hardware in their mobile devices tends to be about a generation behind other manufacturers from my experience. Sometimes it's mobile network hardware, sometimes it's system power/memory, sometimes it's camera."

Sprint,3br622,sparkedman,3,Wed Jul 1 14:13:19 2015 UTC,"OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (BUSINESS WIRE), July 01, 2015 - Sprint (NYSE: S) is rapidly expanding its retail distribution with its “store-within-a-store” concept at co-branded RadioShack locations.  General Wireless Operations announced today that it completed the purchase of the RadioShack brand, securing Sprint’s ability to quickly expand its presence and give consumers access to industry-first leasing plans and the latest devices. Sprint will have a presence in 1,435 Sprint-RadioShack stores by the first week of July. About 300 stores will be completely renovated to the new store-within-a-store model at that time, with the remainder scheduled to be completed by the end of the year. These stores will have new signage, new fixtures and a look-and-feel that is similar to other Sprint-owned stores.  The addition of the Sprint-RadioShack stores expands Sprint’s total retail footprint to approximately 4,500 locations in the United States.     How about that.... Wow."
Sprint,3br622,stylz168,2,Wed Jul 1 14:14:17 2015 UTC,"That really is awesome, and will help drive more awareness of Sprint to locations where retail stores didn't exist.  RadioShack had a lot of good retail footprint, malls, etc. so this is great for Sprint."
Sprint,3br622,tsumeone,3,Wed Jul 1 17:50:38 2015 UTC,"Agreed, and that's a substantial retail footprint he's created. It's remarkable how quickly these stores are being renovated.

The closest corporate store is in Boone, NC which is an hour and a half drive and is the middle of nowhere compared to here.  They used to have a corporate store in Kingsport, but they sold it to wireless express. Now every Sprint store here is a Sprint ""by Wireless Express"" and can't work SWAC accounts, and they also closed both Radioshacks here as well so no hope of a Sprint store there either.  There's about half a million people in the Tri Cities CSA so you'd think they'd have at least 1 corporate store or keep the Radioshack in the biggest city (Johnson City) but nope.  17,122 live in Boone.  The population of Kingsport and Johnson City is around 60,000 each, and Bristol TN + VA is about 50,000.  And that's just in city limits.  I really don't get their decision.

Sprint customers traveling abroad for a short period of time may be eligible to have their Sprint service provisioned to allow for international roaming. See sprint.com/international for full details.  Sprint customers remaining abroad for an extended period of time may want to try to use their Sprint device with a foreign carrier. For certain devices which are engineered to include a SIM slot, Sprint may be able to unlock the device SIM slot for a foreign carrier's SIM card to be inserted. Customers must contact Sprint (see below) and must meet the following conditions:   The device is capable of international SIM unlock The person requesting the international SIM unlock is a current Sprint customer that can authenticate as the Account Holder or an Authorized Contact The applicable device is currently active on a Sprint account and the applicable account has been active for at least 90 days. The account is in good standing The subscriber with which the device is associated has not previously unlocked another device within the past 12 months. If the account is an ASL account: There is no unfulfilled Service Agreement associated with the line of service. There is no outstanding Installment Billing Agreement balance associated with the device.

Sprint,3buhbm,celestisdiabolus,5,Thu Jul 2 06:39:19 2015 UTC,Simple.  VoLTE handoffs to CDMA is not well developed since practically almost no carriers use such a setup.  Verizon basically said screw it and went VoLTE without CDMA handoff because of the strength of their LTE network thanks to their extensive and mature 700 mhz deployments. Yet they still advise people to turn off VoLTE if they have issues with calls dropping because no fallback from VoLTE to CDMA means the calls drop completely and yes even mighty Verizons still have LTE dead zones here and there.  OTOH Sprint faces that same issue with an even weaker network with more coverage holes and random dead zones which will make it beyond swiss cheese like and make the terrible motorola handoff drops look like paradise. So Sprint has to develope and deploy the VoLTE to CDMA fallback technology / software mostly by itself which is the reason they're taking their time.
Sprint,3buhbm,lilotimz,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:02:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the handoff of CDMA not working does suck. Just depends where you live. Where I live, I have only once ever dropped a call because of VOLTE. And they put up another tower which fixed that dead zone. As a customer, I'd prefer having the choice of VOLTE then not having it at all"
Sprint,3buhbm,TheOnlyProfelec,8,Thu Jul 2 21:57:26 2015 UTC,"The 1xAdvanced network is working just fine for voice currently, there is no rush to transition to VoLTE for Sprint.  Do you have a decent reason for why the switch should happen other than because it's newer tech, which means very little in the real world right now? VoLTE uses more network resources and has little benefit right now that doesn't justify a rush to implement it (the network hardware already supports it)."
Sprint,3buhbm,halcyoncmdr,4,Thu Jul 2 06:55:06 2015 UTC,"I hate to say it, but SVD. I'd love to be able to send an iMessage mid phone call."
Sprint,3buhbm,payturrpurandoh,5,Thu Jul 2 10:50:05 2015 UTC,"True, SVD would be nice. But you also have to look at it from the other side. The majority of Sprint customers haven't had SVD, so most don't expect it on Sprint, if they even know it exists at all. The actual number of people that understand their phone's capabilities is very small when you blow it up to a nationwide scale.  As far as iMessage goes, I'd say the vast majority of iPhone users (period, not just Sprint) don't even know what iMessage is. They likely don't use it for anything more than what a standard SMS could do, and the only reason they use it is because it's turned on by default and they aren't informed about it. If they aren't using anything that is iMessage-specific, a standard text instead could work just fine and work while aa call is in progress. Working as a Sprint retail tech from before the iPhone launch until early 2014 I can tell you that easily less than 1% of the iPhones that came in  had iMessage read receipts turned on for example. The number of people going from iPhone to Android and having texting issues due to iMessage were huge however (this was way before Apple gave you the site to login to disable iMessage, back when we had to use an actual iPhone to do it, which the customer often no longer had). It may be anecdotal, but I was in one of the top 30 busiest stores in the country, that's not a small sample size."

Sprint just spent billions installing a brand spanking new CDMA2000 network from the ground up, 2G/3G technology is an integrated part of the build, not a bolt on or a remainder from legacy (like it is for AT&T and T-Mobile, for which there is a legacy 2g cabinet).

Sprint,3buhbm,halcyoncmdr,4,Fri Jul 3 02:12:36 2015 UTC,iDEN was a fundamentally dead technology. Not to mention the licensing required by Motorola for it was much more expensive than all other alternatives.  The only advantage it had was that it didn't rely on the PTSN so it could function at times the switches were down (like during a natural disaster).
Sprint,3buhbm,alohawolf,3,Thu Jul 2 07:00:52 2015 UTC,"It most certainly did rely on the PSTN, every single iDEN site had T-1 backhaul into it (if not via wireline, via Microwave, then wireline), when the T1 went down, you could continue to Direct Connect with other users on that cell but not otherwise."

Not to mention that the iDEN network required more to maintain than comparable CDMA equipment, in large part due to Motorola's pricing. There's a reason Motorola was almost the only manufacturer making iDEN devices, apart from a couple Blackberries."
Sprint,3buhbm,msp33,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:09:26 2015 UTC,"iDEN's raison d'etre was building a cellular network out of non-contiguous spectrum as soon as rebanding happened iDEN was dead tech walking.

Sprint,3bt83q,tacoburritos,0,Sun Jul 5 17:55:42 2015 UTC,I'm sure as you looked at devices in the store you could see that displayed pricing is 100% geared towards lease and finance. Typically by switching you plan it comes out to the same cost as what you're currently are spending if not cheaper and doesn't require any money down depending on credit.   With that said you can still get a 2 year contract and pricing in store but it's pushed towards the web because it doesn't necessarily benefit the sales rep as much when processing one. Tends to be more time consuming than what it's worth towards quotas.

Sprint,3bp6zj,shesaidcunt,2,Wed Jul 1 07:09:25 2015 UTC,"I just switched from Sprint to Project Fi (so I basically can test both side by side on the same device by forcing a specific connection). In my area, they're about equal in performance for the most part, and we only have a single B25 LTE carrier and don't have B41 or B26 here to help offload for Sprint users.  It varies pretty dramatically based on where you are. For example, Sprint just received a shared #1 in Overall Network Performance in Indianapolis. Here's the RootMetrics report if you want to look at that directly. A shared tie between Sprint, Verizon and AT&T, with T-Mobile pretty close behind. A year ago Sprint was dead last in Indy."

Sprint,3bp6zj,stylz168,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:06:45 2015 UTC,"Louisiana is definitely a problem area. The partner carrier that Sprint originally bought out in that area to consolidate ended up spacing the towers very poorly, short of a complete network redesign and build on an entirely new layout, Sprint's current spectrum simply isn't really adequate in that area. 800MHz would work fine probably, but there simply isn't enough of that spectrum to take over for all of the 1900MHz really."

Sprint,3bp6zj,sparkedman,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:01:20 2015 UTC,It's possible he did sign off since the previous data streaming limits on some plans were 1Mbps. The backlash at 600kbps was obviously larger than they anticipated.

His tweet about it doesn't say he didn't know, just:   Was sleeping in Tokyo and when I found out took immediate action.

Sprint,3bp6zj,stylz168,15,Wed Jul 1 02:59:58 2015 UTC,"If it was customers first, shouldn't they of avoided the whole thing to begin with? Limiting unlimited data video streams to such a ludicrous speeds is asking for trouble."
Sprint,3bp6zj,shesaidcunt,-2,Wed Jul 1 04:47:26 2015 UTC,"To be fair, using the H.265 codec, a video stream at 600kbps isn't necessarily terrible quality. The  example in that post is from a 720p video... and I can't think of a reason why at the moment you would realistically need to directly stream higher than 720p on a 6"" screen.  Streaming a video through PLEX (h.264 at the time) from my desktop to my G3 at 720p and 1080p I couldn't see much of a difference, definitely nothing that would detract from the show. I have had similar experience on my Nexus 6 as well."
Sprint,3bp6zj,halcyoncmdr,5,Wed Jul 1 05:19:02 2015 UTC,"The point isn't that you can or can't, it's that it's being called unlimited for everything..except for video, which most people use. It"
Sprint,3bp6zj,shesaidcunt,0,Wed Jul 1 05:20:24 2015 UTC,"You missed my point entirely. While the speed limit is there, it isn't a ""sky is falling"" type of thing as so many here seem to be claiming. There are already codecs that reduce the bitrate enough that the limit isn't really an issue (unless you're using old codecs).  On top of all that, they've already announced they're not doing the 600kbps limit anyway, so it's all a moot point."
Sprint,3bp6zj,halcyoncmdr,3,Wed Jul 1 05:27:10 2015 UTC,"Then why would you limit it, if you can handle the data?  It's BS they even thought it was a good idea.."
Sprint,3bp6zj,shesaidcunt,3,Wed Jul 1 05:33:04 2015 UTC,"It's all about planning for the future. If it's in the plan terms when you get the plan, they can implement it whenever they want (even if they choose not to currently. If they change the plan in the future to add that in, then it would most likely qualify as a ""materially adverse"" change to the terms and allow the user to end with no ETF, etc. and while we don't know about financed and leased devices yet the same as contract phones, it may end up that those devices would end up having to be released just like the ETF-free stuff allowed with devices purchased with subsidies in cases.   Basically, it helps to provide flexibility for the future."
Sprint,3bp6zj,halcyoncmdr,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:36:19 2015 UTC,Why would T-Mobile institute a 21GB usage cap on their unlimited plans?
Sprint,3bp6zj,stylz168,0,Wed Jul 1 13:47:22 2015 UTC,It is not a cap. Limiting high-usage users due to congestion in an area is a lot different than automatically capping at 21gb. I regularly go over 40gb in a big town with no problems.
Sprint,3bp6zj,shesaidcunt,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:21:51 2015 UTC,"That's what Sprint does with high usage customers. Tower is congested, top users get lower prioritization (not a blanket throttle so speed throughput will vary based on the other traffic on the site, this is why it becomes inconsistent and isn't a general ""3G speed"" type of thing)."
Sprint,3bp6zj,halcyoncmdr,2,Wed Jul 1 18:10:52 2015 UTC,"You have a warped sense of shills. There are shills on reddit, and we do get trolls in the carrier subs. Your determination on /u/sparkedman however is entirely unfounded and shows you didn't actually do any research on the user before making that determination. The fact you seem to be a mod over at voat without a good idea of what constitutes shilling and trolling is worrisome, but then again just like reddit, it doesn't take anything to become a mod.  The community here does a decent job self-moderating (via voting and reporting) for the most part.

Sprint,3bp6zj,halcyoncmdr,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:06:00 2015 UTC,"a reason why at the moment you would realistically need to directly stream higher than 720p on a 6"" screen   Sometimes I get pretty excited about a movie or game trailer and I happen to only have my phone handy. If it's a big enough deal (I'm a big scifi geek so Interstellar is a good example of this) and the video is aesthetically significant, I'll want to watch it in the best quality available.  That's my reason anyway. But I'm not a Sprint customer ATM, I just want Sprint to put its best foot forward to give as much competition to the baby bells as possible."
Sprint,3bp6zj,zakats,2,Wed Jul 1 17:03:55 2015 UTC,"On a 6"" screen though you aren't going to see much of a difference in a 720p or 1080p video unless you have that screen almost attached to your retinae. Regardless of codec or bitrate concerns, the screen size is the major limiter.  This chart isn't perfect, but it gives a good general indication for phone-sized screens. Most of the good charts I've seen that were really useful were dealing with TV screens, and the distances are much different there obviously.  While a difference does exist, in the context of a video you're watching, the moving image won't allow your brain/eyes the time to notice much of a difference between 720p and 1080p like a still image would where you have the time to focus on that one image.  So once you take the resolution aspect of it down to what's realistically needed, you get much smaller files needed, which means lower bitrates needed, and utilizing advanced codecs you can end up with a 720p stream using H.265 for instance falling at that 600kbps bitrate. An 800kbps 1080p bitrate of that same stream may not be noticeably different on that your phone, so why do you need it other than ""because I can/want to""?"
Sprint,3bp6zj,halcyoncmdr,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:23:58 2015 UTC,"Certainly, that is a valid point that I can agree with in general. Since we're talking about video trailers, we're talking 24-30 FPS so I'll write that off and stick with pixel heights.   At 5"" I can tell the difference between 720 and 1080p. I'm no pixel whore and am happy with 1080p for a 5-6"" screen but, it's my personal preference for the higher resolution on these rare occasions.  I'm not complaining, I'm just making the point that I have a particular instance where I have a clear preference for the highest quality video playback available... however minor the difference may be, I appreciate the difference. Not that it needs to be a thing very often, maybe a just a bit higher limit would be useful to both network strategy and UX. Perhaps a throttle that works for HQ 720p on H.264."
Sprint,3bp6zj,zakats,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:10:48 2015 UTC,"I can understand that, and a trailer won't take long to buffer in most cases, it's a relatively small file; and if it's a popular file it can be loaded into a network CDN or a closer CDN through network partners to help offset any performance penalties on the network-side. So, let's look at the streaming from the network perspective, we'll take Netflix as a good every day example for many users.  Netflix streams 1080p HD at 3Mbps for instance. Now, I can't seem to fine definitive numbers on how many users a single LTE carrier can use, but I did find a dubious reference to 300 simultaneous active connections. So assuming we have 300 users all streaming HD Netflix, we would end up with 900Mbps just with those users. That means there is no more room for anyone else to browse the web, load Facebook, use Google Drive, etc. on that LTE carrier, even excess backhaul is available.  Now normally that 300 active session limit may not be an issue because most data usage is done in small bursts. Loading a webpage might be only 2MB and done in a few seconds (accounting for multiple network connections for any scripting, ads, etc.). That person downloading their 100MB game from Google Play though will have that connection for a couple minutes while they get it downloaded. Streaming however is often almost constant bandwidth usage. Youtube does it better by only buffering a portion ahead at a time, this is why you see the progress bar jump up a chunk at a time; but most streaming doesn't do this (Google does it because it helps their servers primarily, if you're not going to watch the whole thing, they don't send it all). A single Netflix stream could possibly take up the network resource equivalent of a couple dozen people browsing (again, I'm working on an educated guesstimation since I can't find solid numbers for much of this, it simply isn't easily found on the general web here, and I no longer have contacts with the Sprint network team to find out any general specifics for usage).  When it comes to constant bandwidth usage like streaming even small differences in bitrate can have larger effects when compounded by thousands of users in an area."

Every time I watch an Un-Carrier event I just want to go to T-Mobile's website and switch right then but then I think about my friends with T-Mobile and their service outside of a city and the 21GB data cap and I don't.  John Legere really has a way with words/presentations that just gets me hyped about T-Mobile. However, I believe that in the long run Sprint will be the superior carrier."
Sprint,3bp6zj,issafram,2,Wed Jul 1 07:02:21 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, Legere knows how to play to an audience. The question really becomes what happens when folks see past the act? I can wear a blazer and jeans and curse on stage just the same, but I'm limited by the product that I'm offering.  Consider for a second that their B12 network (700 mhz A) is limited to a maximum throughput of 37mbps, single user on the cell site. What happens when their user base increases in those areas where 700a is deployed? If the goal is expand coverage, without adding on the higher capacity B4, those customers who believe they are entitled to use their phones as a home ISP replacement will be upset. Suddenly the data strong network won't be so strong.   That's the challenge with pandering to a certain crowd. You get the attention, but you get everything else along with it.   T-Mobile has done a lot for the industry, many positive steps, but what they have effectively ruined is carrier loyalty. I've worked in the industry for almost 14 years, since the days of Bell Atlantic Mobile and AT&T Wireless using TDMA, and can tell you that the loyalty factor is gone now. Customers are now jumping ship more often, looking for the next wow factor. Today is T-Mobile, tomorrow it may be Sprint (if Carrier Aggregation is as effective nationwide as it is right now, 2x20 CA is averaging north of 80-100mbps).  Legere has done a great job in convincing people that he's looking out for them, that he's one of them, and the media has eaten him up. He's the Kanye of the wireless industry, and the fans love him for it. He even admitted once that it's just an act for him."

Sprint,3bp6zj,xfortune,-2,Wed Jul 1 19:36:55 2015 UTC,"no carrier's plans are set in stone.    rule of thumb:     if there's no expiration date, it's a plan, it will be around for at LEAST half a year, probably longer.   if there is an expiration date, it's a promotion and will likely only last a month or a couple months.       plans tend to be priced less aggressively than promotions, which is why this might seem 'underwhelming' to most people, but they're the sustained money makers, they need to be profitable.     unlimited IS the elephant in the room, but you also have to remember, while video streaming is becoming more common, video compression codecs are becoming more efficient. if Sprint decides to cap streaming video, like they wanted to, at 600kbps, they could continue unlimited data almost indefinitely, or in the least, offer TONS of data. same thing goes for music. when you take music and video out of the equation, people barely use any data.  the most likely scenario is that unlimited data will fade out because it's no longer needed, not because they're unable to satisfy demand. as soon as they can phase out unlimited, they can nip abuse of unlimited (excessive downloading, tethering, etc.) in the bud."

If they can get people accustom to low quality at all times, then that helps future congestion issues. But it blew up hard in their faces. Kind of like Microsoft when they announced the Xbox one.. What a disaster. They took longer to correct their mistake though.

Sprint,3bn4si,tsumeone,3,Tue Jun 30 19:46:45 2015 UTC,Sprint still knows the website you connect to.  Even on my crap Netgear router I can throttle connections whether they are SSL or not based on the destination or source.

Sprint,3bn4si,Photojared,11,Tue Jun 30 19:44:41 2015 UTC,And you're probably the reason they're adding the cap...
Sprint,3bn4si,koalahumper,2,Tue Jun 30 20:21:14 2015 UTC,But all the time I do it its encrypted over SSL/TSL so it's not like Sprint could see or compress the videos.   On a side note the only way Sprint could limit the data usage of a YouTube video (because of SSL/TSL) is to throttle domains/IPs which is illegal.   For over a year whenever I watch a video over cellular data that's not encrypted by SSL/TSL it looks like shit however if it is encrypted such as YouTube and Netflix Hulu then it looks fine. Hulu is sort of strange because the shows are encrypted but the ads aren't so the ads look (and sound) like absolute shit but the shows are in HD. BTW compressing video to 600Kbps on Sprint isn't new. They have been doing it to all plans for over a year.
Sprint,3bn4si,halcyoncmdr,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:31:12 2015 UTC,"There's nothing illegal about throttling on a mobile network. Video streaming uses an extraordinary amount of bandwidth for a long period of time in comparison to just about anything else. Due to the nature of spectrum on mobile networks, they are not bound by all of the same requirements as a wireline operator.  Throttling high bandwidth uses that adversely affect the rest of the network is within the bounds of the FCC's disclosed mobile network rules.  Your type of usage is why these limits are being implemented. If you can't comprehend that then I don't know what to say."
Sprint,3bn4si,koalahumper,-2,Tue Jun 30 21:37:14 2015 UTC,I understand that but then again people like me will just use a VPN or a site that tunnels the video through SSL/TSL (which most sites do).

Sprint,3bq0yn,Photojared,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:05:10 2015 UTC,Call or chat with the int'l dept and they'll unlock it for international use immediately if its active on your account. Takes quite a few business days if its inactive.

Sprint,3bqd12,SoloSkeptik,2,Wed Jul 1 08:18:54 2015 UTC,Is your device fully paid for? Did it specify international or domestic? Did you have a previous device that was unlocked at all (even just international)?
Sprint,3bqd12,halcyoncmdr,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:41:44 2015 UTC,Device is on lease; didn't specify domestic/int'l; I upgraded from a 3 year old S3 so no previous device unlocks.  I didn't think to take a screenshot until it was too late unfortunately.

Sprint,3boh8j,dsatrbs,5,Tue Jun 30 21:23:09 2015 UTC,"On the subject of complexity of bills, nothing beats the old Nextel bills from years ago, I could never make heads or tails of what exactly I was being billed for, yet it was pages and pages of charges."
Sprint,3boh8j,alohawolf,3,Wed Jul 1 19:46:27 2015 UTC,"> its All-In plans don’t include taxes and fees, which often add 10 percent or more to a monthly bill.   Most other carriers do the same, but Sprint missed an opportunity to really go all-in if it wanted.   AT&T doesn't, Verizon doesn't, T-Mobile doesn't, Cricket does because they're a prepaid brand. This article is terrible."
Sprint,3boh8j,mitten_mike,2,Wed Jul 1 00:41:29 2015 UTC,"It's weird that they say ""All-In"" when the price isn't all in. Cricket literally uses the same phrase, but they are inclusive of taxes and fees.  It's slightly misleading, and a missed opportunity."
Sprint,3boh8j,praemonitus_,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:56:37 2015 UTC,"You're overlooking the fact that a customer in rural Oregon and one in metro Atlanta will have wildly different amounts of taxes and fees. The Sprint plan is more or less the same cost wherever you are. I live in a county that charges $1.25 for 911. Sprint didn't create that fee or set my tax rate. They shouldn't eat the costs associated with living in particularly expensive places. If a customer is unhappy with the taxes and fees, that's something they need to take up with their local and state governments.   And, again, Cricket is prepaid. That's an entirely different business model."
Sprint,3bo86i,tanmaker,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:17:24 2015 UTC,how much is service for a 2 year contract through best buy?
Sprint,3bo86i,mitten_mike,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:32:14 2015 UTC,"That really depends on what plan you currently have.  If you don't have a plan or are looking for a new one, you'll be better off going the Easy Pay or lease route. Sprint jacks up the month cost on contract plans which makes them a worse deal than the Easy Pay or lease plans."
Sprint,3bo86i,Lokixx3,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:33:13 2015 UTC,I looked on the Target website but I dont see the s6 64gb marked down 100 dollars.
Sprint,3bpx2e,KidFenrik,2,Wed Jul 1 05:04:06 2015 UTC,"Yes. That's how it should work.  See: Sprint Lease and the FAQ's  Best buy offers an even better deal: $19/month Loyalty Service Credit on the LG G4   Free LG G4  Lease an LG G4 and get a $19 loyalty service credit. It's like getting the LG G4 for free, plus a $1 bill credit each month.  In store only. Terms and conditions apply.     You should run the numbers though to see if a new Sprint or Best Buy One Family plan would give you better pricing.  How many lines do you have?"
Sprint,3bpx2e,sparkedman,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:27:19 2015 UTC,4 Lines on the EDS1500 plan currently. Paying around $260-264/mo but also just canceled TEP on the lines that still had it which should be - $22
Sprint,3bpx2e,sparkedman,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:07:28 2015 UTC,So the Best Buy One Family Plan would run you: $100/month for the first 2 lines and $40/month for each additional line.  So that's $180 for 4 lines (Unlimited Talk/Text/Data) and then you'd have to pay for the devices.
Sprint,3bpx2e,FiddlingCactus,2,Wed Jul 1 13:02:35 2015 UTC,"In general, yes that's how that works.  Technically, Sprint is not discounting the device down $15.  They are charging full price ($18/mo) and giving you a $15 loyalty bill credit.  This technicality really only shows itself if you choose to cancel service since the remaining payments will become due ($18 x remaining months, not $3 x remaining months).  The lease + credit will be the better option from a purely financial standpoint.1  2 year is the better option if owning your device is a top priority.  1 This is assuming you want to stay on the ED1500 plan.  There may be cheaper options depending on data usage to move to a Family Share Plan and lease the devices at the regular amount."
Sprint,3boqqo,Horsepower2,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:33:36 2015 UTC,"As it stands right now, yes you can keep your same plan. You can still do a regular 2 year contract and get a phone at a subsidized rate if you'd like. However, most people on the Everything Data 1500 are eligible for a $15 monthly promotional credit if you go with the lease option. Depending on what phones you want, you can just do the math to see what makes more sense."

Sprint,3bpp3e,zakats,5,Wed Jul 1 03:47:53 2015 UTC,"Short answer: sprint only owns 5mhz continuous LTE spectrum on band 25. Therefore, it can only do 5mhz of LTE, maybe more if they use carrier aggregation.  Band 25 is actually a superset of band 2 (60mhz) and a small sliver of 5mhz(1990-1995mhz)  http://niviuk.free.fr/lte_band.php  Band 2 is more commonly used/held (by att/T-Mobile/Verizon)  From this site, you can see all of that small 5mhz sliver (1990-1995) is owned solely by sprint. Sprint owns some band 2 (parts of 60mhz)spectrum in some regions, but its not contiguous and cannot be joined together to get 10mhz  http://specmap.sequence-omega.net  T-Mobile and Verizon have been trading AWS spectrum to gain continuous blocks(to run 20mhz LTE). Doubt this is possible for band 2/25 since there are many more players holding the spectrum in different regions"
Sprint,3bpp3e,pwastage,2,Wed Jul 1 04:08:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks a bunch for your reply.  Consider my market, MTA040 Little Rock, AR: While, yes Sprint holds PCS block-G basically everywhere, they've also got the 15x15 PCS block-B here. I don't see CDMA 1x and EVDO using the 15mhz. I'd imagine that 1x and EVDO on the G-block would fit well enough while the continuous 15mhz B-block would allow pretty good data competition against the other carriers without even touching BRS- it'd be cheap speed.  Is this a device compatibility thing, not supporting more than 5x5?"
Sprint,3bpp3e,evan1123,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:37:25 2015 UTC,"CDMA will use many carriers in the B block. Depending on site needs, they could be using all 30MHz of PCS B for CDMA. That 30MHz number is kind of a ""magic number"" though in that Sprint is able to deploy a 2nd 5x5MHz carrier with minimal refarming. I would keep your eye out for the 2nd carrier to show, which is identifiable with signal check or engineering screens  Sprint doesn't deploy more than 5x5 in PCS because the G block is typically separated from the rest of their PCS holdings, and because older band 25 only devices are not certified for more than 5MHz FDD."
Sprint,3bpp3e,halcyoncmdr,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:26:53 2015 UTC,"Good answer, thanks."
Sprint,3bpp3e,13bmoses,2,Wed Jul 1 18:23:58 2015 UTC,"To add, I think there are also a couple Sprint devices that were originally released that can only utilize a 5x5MHz FDD carrier. So even if there were 10MHz contiguous available, they would end up having to alienate all of those devices from LTE, essentially making them 3G-only devices."
Sprint,3bpp3e,stylz168,2,Wed Jul 1 05:30:49 2015 UTC,"its only 5x5 because all of their other B25 capable spectrum is tied up in CDMA and 3G carriers. 5x5 was all they had available when they started rolling out LTE. sometime down the road as things progress they will eventually be able to go back and start re-farming 3G and CDMA carriers to add additional 5x5 B25 carriers, or even add them together to make a 10x10.  there are around 30 markets that already have enough PCS spectrum to deploy a 2nd B25 carrier (without re-farming) and it has been coming online in those markets over the past 3-4 months. other markets will have to wait until re-farming can happen."
Sprint,3bpp3e,stylz168,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:07:36 2015 UTC,"So here is the deal, B25 is the band designation for 1900 mhz PCS - G Block. That is also a superset designation for B2, so any device in theory certified for B25 would work just fine on B2 LTE networks.  That being said, the PCS G-Block was awarded to Nextel because they had to reband their core 800mhz network due to interference. That 10 mhz chunk was then used by Sprint to deploy LTE, since it was greenfield (unused), so no worries about interference or anything.  Sprint has markets across the country that they have contiguous spectrum (mostly 15mhz of PCS B-block), where they can deploy an LTE carrier on once they refarm existing 1x and 3G traffic.  Just keep in mind that while LTE is spectrum efficient, older technologies like 1x and EVDO are not. One of the reasons why Sprint deployed 1xAdvanced on their 800mhz 1x network is to gain 4 times the capacity of the single 1x carrier."
Sprint,3bpp3e,stylz168,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:14:48 2015 UTC,"ny device in theory certified for B25 would work just fine on B2 LTE networks.   As long as the cell tower is broadcasting a mbfi for band 25, right? As I understand, band 12 phones don't work on band 17 towers unless the band 17 tower is employing mbfi."
Sprint,3bpp3e,stylz168,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:21:49 2015 UTC,"Yep, which I believe markets that have the 2nd PCS carrier online are doing now."

Sprint,3bmr8a,sparkedman,0,Tue Jun 30 18:56:54 2015 UTC,"if they want to compress a video to the point where it doesn't use more bandwidth than a 3g connection would, they will. their compression rate is entirely up to them. I don't think it's a bad idea, you can't expect everyone on the network to be streaming 5mbps constantly of video, especially in congested markets, so if you want everyone to have a good connection, you need to do this kind of thing. in a round about way they're being transparent with their want / need to control network congestion. if they never mentioned it people probably wouldn't even notice until they look for it.   600kbps is probably too low, but if they actually go by what EVDO is capable of, 2mbps isn't terrible for streaming, especially with good compression.  I still prefer the old 'video streaming MAY be limited to 3g' though."

Sprint,3bmr8a,Comrade_Nugget,3,Tue Jun 30 16:35:11 2015 UTC,Thats of course peak. On average i would be expecting more like 50 to 60 for 2xCA
Sprint,3bmr8a,13bmoses,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:42:31 2015 UTC,"yep, they have been running 20 to 30 average on single B41 areas right now, so doubling that would give you those real world averages. i'm sure someone will find a lightly loaded tower and test it at 2am to see how close to 160 they can get :D  heck i have 1 B41 tower near me (only have 3 live in the market so far) and its only running 1 B41 carrier and still is throttled to 40 since the backhaul hasn't been upgraded yet. anytime i run a speedtest on it i pretty much hit 40 on it, sometimes it will dip to 30. so once they up the backhaul and do 2xCA on this tower i could see it easily running 130+ all times of the day."
Sprint,3bmr8a,Comrade_Nugget,2,Tue Jun 30 19:11:29 2015 UTC,"The data i have said it the estimated peak will be around 152, i guess there is theoretical max and then the estimated peak."

Now whether or not other people notice the severe lack of quality in their videos is something else. I guess only time will tell. And heck maybe they don’t actually throttle your videos right now and they just have it in there so when the network comes to it’s knees in a few years they can hit the brakes hard and it be perfectly fine for them to do so because it was in the terms the entire time.  I still think it’s deceiving to sell unlimited where you are clearly limited in some aspect. Especially when they only let you know in really tiny print, or with somebody speaking so fast, telling you at the end of a commercial, where they say it all in under 2 seconds.  I am happy with my old everything shared plan though so long as they don’t eventually force everybody off of it a few years down the road."

It's the same $60 plan we already have, it's just a ""promotion"" for that plan that gives customers the full cost of the service up front with the device included so there's no confusion about it being ""only $60"". Now they tell you it's $80 with device cost included assuming you lease a $20 device."
Sprint,3bm8b8,AJJ18,2,Tue Jun 30 13:48:54 2015 UTC,It's a good deal if you are a solo plan user and Sprint actually works where you need it.   The bad part is it's a 24 month lease so your bill never goes down unless you decide to pay another ~ $200 to keep your phone.

Sprint,3bm8b8,snakester,2,Tue Jun 30 12:53:28 2015 UTC,If you own your device the plan is $60 unlimited everything. The $80 mark is the $60 plan plus a $20 lease.
Sprint,3bm8b8,B1GEast,0,Tue Jun 30 13:06:32 2015 UTC,"Cool story, what do you do with your phone when you want to upgrade? Sell it? What's the point of owning it if you upgrade every couple of years anyway?    and Sprint is just as good as T-Mobile or AT&T or Verizon as far as BYOP goes.

Sprint,3bm8b8,mitten_mike,-1,Tue Jun 30 14:09:50 2015 UTC,"the iPhone 6 has depreciated about 25% in the last year, so if you're selling your phones every year, that would be a reasonable number. leases are for 2 years though, so you're looking at least at 50% depreciation over 2 years, which would be more like $450, so you're losing about $150 paying $480 over a 2 year lease, vs. selling a 2 year old phone for $450 with $300 depreciation.    $150 for the convenience of not having to plop down $750 when you buy a phone or having to sell it on craigslist or swappa, written off over 2 years is only about $6 a month."
Sprint,3bm8b8,B1GEast,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:26:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Factor in damage fees, because that's most likely to happen. Plus sometimes I give my phone to a family member or friend. I'd rather not have my phone tied to my carrier."
Sprint,3bm8b8,mitten_mike,-1,Tue Jun 30 16:51:12 2015 UTC,"a) sprint doesn't have 'damage fees'    b) damage will factor into depreciation    c) all US phones are tied to a carrier because manufacturers build them that way. it's happenstance that an AT&T phone works on T-Mobile, or vice versa. unless a manufacturer builds their device to work on other carriers, all devices are 'locked' to the carriers who offer them."
Sprint,3bm8b8,B1GEast,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:19:31 2015 UTC,"Not to mention the fact that I can take my phone to any carrier if my current carrier stops meeting my needs or I move.

Sprint,3bm8b8,Twedledee5,2,Tue Jun 30 11:04:57 2015 UTC,"Every other company is rightly separating device pricing from service so they can innovate on pricing models. Sprint is bringing them back together like it's a good deal. I mean, the whole reason we hate contracts is that we want transparency is pricing and the option to leave anytime without getting hit with that ETF. Why the hell is Sprint pushing so hard to basically bring back the contract and lock down customers? I pay $90 for three lines on Cricket and Sprint want $80 for one line with half the network and a lease. Get real."
Sprint,3bm8b8,mitten_mike,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:46:26 2015 UTC,"a) the problem wasn't contracts, the problem was hiding excessive charges inside the 'bundled' price. companies were basically charging FAR too much for 'devices', disguising them as service contracts, and no one knew because they didn't disclose the price of the phone or allow people to BYOP.. Sprint still offers no-contract and BYOP. you can go in and see the difference in pricing between full retail, installments, and leasing, so like most of what Sprint has been doing, this is just adding another option.  b) they're doing this because it's profitable and 'locking people in' helps with accounting and churn. you should know that Mr. Strategic Management.  c) are you seriously comparing Cricket to Sprint?"
Sprint,3bm8b8,magentafullsoul,2,Tue Jun 30 11:15:09 2015 UTC,"this is just adding another option.

Hope you realize the irony of that.   they're doing this because it's profitable and 'locking people in' helps with accounting and churn   ...or drives them away because the cost to join is too high. Take me for example, I won't even consider this plan, chances are there are many like me.   comparing Cricket to Sprint?   Double the coverage, half the price. Why not?

Walden was a key player in drafting the legislation that authorized the incentive auction. ""We are of one mind on this: There will be an Incentive Auction in the first quarter of 2016,"" Wheeler said.     I find it interesting how Sprint isn't mentioned at all in this piece. Sprint has really kept a low profile on this compared to T-Mobile as of late, which is spending money on superhero videos. I think Sprint is being smart here with its strategy/communications plan."
Sprint,3bjqra,B1GEast,2,Mon Jun 29 20:03:51 2015 UTC,"Sprint doesn't really need a lot of 600mhz, they could do with just 5mhz. Since their network is based on the high density of 2.5Ghz it isn't necessary for them to own a lot of low-band spectrum because they can still refarm a good part of 800mhz and 1900mhz for better coverage. If anything 600mhz is useful for them to expand coverage in rural markets. T-Mobile on the other hand will eventually hit a spectrum crunch so they really do need at least 10mhz or more if the intend to remain competitive."
Sprint,3bjqra,halcyoncmdr,2,Mon Jun 29 20:28:12 2015 UTC,"refarm a good part of 800mhz   Sprint has precious little 800Mhz spectrum. Enough for a single 1xAdvanced carrier for voice, and one 5x5Mhz LTE carrier. Even then, in some areas Sprint only has enough spectrum for a 3x3Mhz carrier on LTE. Refarming 1900Mhz is one thing, and it is definitely possible. There is no refarming 800Mhz though, the spectrum simply doesn't exist.  Add to that the areas within the IBEZ (basically anything within 100km of the Canadian and Mexican borders) and those area are entirely reliant on 1900Mhz spacing and 2500Mhz (and many ofthese areas simply aren't populated enough to justify the density needed for a proper 2.5GHz deployment at the moment when you compare it to places like LA and NYC.  I live in the IBEZ, without 800Mhz here the Sprint network is still extremely spotty since coverage gaps exist due to building that has occurred since the site locations were originally determined. Short of redesigning the entire network spacing from scratch here, low band spectrum is the only hope to fill in those gaps unless Mexico gets it together for rebanding. The most annoying part of it however is that the IBEX ends halfway into downtown, yet none of the city is getting 800Mhz anytime soon, even areas that are north of the IBEZ."

Sprint,3bi7wy,sparkedman,2,Mon Jun 29 12:58:13 2015 UTC,"From Article:   But Hamilton was all smiles on Friday when a Sprint representative showed up at her home with her brand-new gold Samsung Galaxy S5. After sitting with her for more than an hour, setting up the new smartphone, downloading her favorite apps and ensuring her old text messages and e-mails transferred over, she was left impressed.  ""They have stepped their game up with this,"" Hamilton said.   ....   .....It launched in Sprint's home market of Kansas City in April, and on Monday, the carrier officially expanded to New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Denver, with plans to roll into new markets later this year.   ....   Direct 2 You sales representative Brett Golba was outfitted in a black button-down shirt, a Sprint logo affixed atop his left vest pocket, plus khakis and a matching black Sprint messenger bag. But he put on his most important accessory right before he walked into Hamilton's apartment: a pair of light blue booties he slipped over his shoes, as a courtesy to avoid scuffing up the floors.  Golba, who had stints dealing with customers in the field at DirecTV and Time Warner Cable, joined Sprint in March and has helped the company usher in Direct 2 You to cities such Kansas City and Chicago. He started taking appointments in the New York area a week ago as part of a trial run for the program. After training the local reps for the next few weeks, he'll move on to another market.   ....   Hamilton's reaction is exactly what Sprint is going for as it rolls out Direct 2 You across the country. The company is taking the initiative seriously, promising to eventually deploy 5,000 Sprint-logo cars and Direct 2 You reps nationwide.  This isn't like the old cable routine where you wait around during a three-hour block for your technician; customers pick their time and place, and the rep shows up on time.  ""People have been surprised by how nice we are,"" Golba said. ""People are really loving it.""  The locations so far have varied. One rep met with a parent at her child's soccer game for a set-up. Another met near the beach.   ....   Golba, for instance, said he is shooting for reps to meet with two to three customers a day.   ....   ""It's an amazing problem to have to ramp up for,"" said Karen Paletta, the northeastern regional vice president for Sprint. She said she hopes to expand the service as quickly as possible, and has a plan to put more resources in areas where demand jumps.     Sounds like things are off to a good start!"

How would you know this without seeing any of the numbers?  Marcelo has vetted this program throughly. He actually used to do this when he was starting up a cell phone business before Brightstar.  See: Article   Within two years, Claure owned 150 stores in the Northeast and had set up a network of drivers, who carried phones in their car trunks, and delivered them to customers to make the purchase hassle-free. In 1997, he moved to Miami to launch Brightstar.   Also see: Forbes Article   At the time of the SoftBank acquisition, Brightstar had revenues of $6.2 billion and customers in 125 countries on six continents, the company then said. By the end of 2013, Brightstar’s gross revenue had reached $10.2 billion, according to today’s release.  ....  The charismatic Claure was so good at helping big companies gain market share that within six years, revenues reportedly jumped north of $1.2 billion. He also managed to force his two major competitors–public Cellstar and Brightpoint–out of Latin America entirely. (And–did you catch that?–his company is named with the better half of each of his competitor’s names mashed together.)  Brightstar provides global distribution for Motorola, Blackberry, Apple, HTC, LG, and Samsung; it was also Softbank’s supplier for trade-in and phone buy-back programs.   Brightstar is now wholly owned by SoftBank and still handles these logistics and distribution tasks for manufacturers and carriers. All of that money straight into SoftBank's warchest and available for Sprint to use for its Network builds, Spectrum Auctions...  You're also not accounting for the value of the cars/reps as mobile advertising.  Circling the drain? Hardly. SoftBank has gone all-in and opened the checkbook for Sprint's Next Generation Network Build.  How's Deutsche Telekom treating T-Mobile? See here...  Marcelo himself is worth over $900 Million and has specific experience running this kind of operation... You really want to doubt him on this?"
Sprint,3bi7wy,dsatrbs,0,Mon Jun 29 14:17:53 2015 UTC,"5000 vehicles, okay so you can buy them and write them down to depreciation or you can lease a fleet of them.  Lets assume you get a sweet deal and are leasing a fleet for, I don't know, lets assume $100/month/vehicle, it's a nice small number and they'll be econoboxes with crank windows. Lets assume their insurance and fuel costs are dirt cheap too, maybe they only drive about 80 miles a day to hit 2-3 people, $200/mo. Multiply that by 5000 vehicles. $1.5 million a year. Not too bad. Lets assume no maintenance costs, because what the heck they're new cars and it's mostly oil changes. Now you have salaries...  Assume you pay these guys $11.50/hr, they spend an average of 2.5/hr day on direct customer interaction, and 2 hours in travel. Maybe 5 hours a day, lets keep them under 30 so we don't have to give them any medical or dental and their total comp can be about $16,500. Lets be generous and say they get 4000 employees in full swing so a bunch of cars are idling.  5.6 million a month to run, lets say they hit 15,000 customers, you are paying $375 per customer for retention, right?  Well, Sprint's churn is 2.09%, so maybe only 2% of those customers any given month would have switched away from Sprint. Lets be generous again and say that every customer you touched didn't switch, so the churn rate for Direct 2 You customers drops to zero due to the direct sales.  You just spent $18,750 to retain each customer... what the heck?"
Sprint,3bi7wy,halcyoncmdr,2,Mon Jun 29 14:45:00 2015 UTC,I don't think you have all the numbers...  Marcelo did this successfully before launching Brightstar.
Sprint,3bi7wy,evan1123,0,Mon Jun 29 15:11:04 2015 UTC,"I'm only accounting for vehicles and labor, and being fairly generous. As far as costs are concerned (advertising, etc.) there's nowhere to go but up.  I didn't factor in the cost of the handset sales, which I'm not sure they're even making that much money on... if I had an average handset value I could have an idea. If it was $150/handset kickback for Sprint, which it likely isn't, but assuming there was, you are still losing $225/customer.  Maybe he is getting a sweeter deal on his fleet leases, and is paying closer to minimum wage, and they're working less hours. Still a money loser even if all of that was true.  edit: If he paid them as independent contractors and paid them at a piece rate, then they could contain costs. If you paid a fixed $40-50 per sale and limited a contractor to 4 sales per day, and supplied them with like a t-shirt and a big door magnet for their car... that would be fairly breakeven.  I wonder how he did it previously."
Sprint,3bi7wy,dsatrbs,3,Mon Jun 29 15:25:09 2015 UTC,"Your analysis is an interesting read. I'm not implying otherwise.  However, you're leaving out a couple key points:  1) You can afford to lose money on certain parts of your business if you make up for it in others. 2) There's enhanced brand value in advertising: 5000 movable billboards nationwide.  This is a service differentiator for Sprint. No one else does this, and Marcelo had specific experience making it work and turned it into Brightstar. If this was introduced as an ""Uncarrier 11"" by Legere, would you have the same concerns?"
Sprint,3bi7wy,payturrpurandoh,3,Mon Jun 29 16:14:25 2015 UTC,"Not every part of a business directly makes money. There are a lot of things that are indirect money makers, or money savers instead.  Costco sells a Kosher Hot Dog and a fountain drink for $1.50 nationwide. There is no way that makes money, it loses them money. But it brings people in, it makes people think of Costco that otherwise might not at the time. The same thing happens with your local grocery store and their rotisserie chickens. That chicken, fully prepared may cost you $5, but a nearly identical raw chicken back in the deli area might be $10 instead. It's not about directly making money with this program, it doesn't. It makes people think of Sprint, it gives them a very positive experience they'll remember and recommend.  Sprint is not simply trying to contain costs and maximize shareholder profit. The Japanese doesn't look at the books quarterly the same way Wall Street does, they plan on a much longer basis. Claure has shown with BrightStar that he looks at it in a similar way."
Sprint,3bi7wy,Draiko,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:18:19 2015 UTC,"The Costco example is spot on.  Sprint's in it for the long game, and it's got deep resources of Spectrum, Cash and Management/Engineering talent now that SoftBank owns them and Marcelo is executing his strategy.  SoftBank's acquisition/ownership of BrightStar (which Marcelo founded and ran as CEO) is a cash cow and Sprint can leverage those economics over other carriers.  People continue to underestimate Sprint. I say ""Fine. Let them."""

I'm going to lean closer to ""break even"" when it comes to the cost/benefit of it, but I still think it's too little to stem the bleeding of customers... for every few thousand dispatches you are only saving about a hundred customers from switching.   Also consider that the types of customers who need a sit down to show how to use their new phone are not the types to jump ship easily. We'll see how long the program goes for."

Sprint,3bf3ud,koalahumper,5,Mon Jun 29 17:22:26 2015 UTC,"This might be the first time I've seen Sprint ""hype"" anything. I'd say revamped plans, possibly matching T-Mobile with 3 upgrades a year on leases. I don't think they will make a big deal out of CA because its not widespread enough for a big announcement (too technical for consumers)."
Sprint,3bf3ud,B1GEast,2,Sun Jun 28 20:35:16 2015 UTC,"They've hyped things during Hesse, but every time it was disappointing.  I hope this isn't the case now that Marcelo is in charge."
Sprint,3bf3ud,evan1123,2,Sun Jun 28 20:40:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I remember that disappointing Under Armour event Hesse held last year. It's just Sprint normally does a Friday press release dump, so this is interesting."
Sprint,3bf3ud,B1GEast,2,Sun Jun 28 20:47:24 2015 UTC,What was the Under Armour event?
Sprint,3bf3ud,sparkedman,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:03:53 2015 UTC,"Sprint held an event last year and played it up like there was a big announcement coming. Lots of anticipation from Sprint fans. It ended up being about carrier billed Spotify and some fitness partnership with Under Armour. Almost nobody covered it despite being a ""live"" event. Sprint was trying to use Framily plans as a vehicle to upsell related services. It was the polar opposite of an uncarrier event. That's why nobody is excited about Sprint announcements and they stick to press releases on Friday."
Sprint,3bf3ud,B1GEast,2,Mon Jun 29 03:31:44 2015 UTC,"Ahhh... Thanks for the info. Was there just no excitement in the room? Maybe Hesse needed to wear a yellow/black shirt and drink a Red Bull... Would that have helped, or did no one care about carrier billed services?  Friday's are terrible days for news releases... Unless it's for bad/embarrassing news on the afternoon."

Sprint,3bf3ud,sparkedman,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:44:08 2015 UTC,"In fairness, the WiMAX sites have about as much bandwidth to them as a Network Vision site."
Sprint,3bf3ud,alohawolf,2,Mon Jun 29 05:28:07 2015 UTC,Not neccesarily.   A typical network vision site was ordered to be able to support at minimum 2 or 3 5 mhz FDD-LTE carriers for 3 sectors each which is about 200-300 mbps.   Clearwire Wimax sites typically were daisy chained like hell (10+ sites chained together was typical) with each site alloted something like 50 mbps to be split into 3 sectors which is the reason why Wimax and now Band 41 on a number of the Clear sites hover 10-20 mbps tops.   The upgraded backhaul Wimax sites can give close to 50-60 mbps each sector for something like 150ish mbps backhaul so they're similar but nowhere near what fully provisioned Sprint B41 sites are which are in the range of 500 mbps to well over a gigabit as to fully backhaul a Band 41 carrier for 3 sectors you need approx 300 mbps.

Sprint,3bf3ud,alohawolf,3,Mon Jun 29 01:12:07 2015 UTC,Sprint is not ready for VOLTE at all and it will unlikely be rolled out nationwide til next year.  They may have it live in FITs later this year but CDMA + VOLTE us a pita since no one has really  developed it. 800 mhz or not sprint still has far too many coverage holes and random dead zones due to lack of heavy network optimization and there's no fallback to cdma in the current VOLTE setups used by everyone else.
Sprint,3bf3ud,phantom240,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:07:22 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Even in urban areas, until full B41 deployment and further EV-DO to LTE refarming, they can't even consider VoLTE.  They don't have 100% LTE coverage, there are still EV-DO only gaps in many places, without new site development, I can't see them actually deploying it."
Sprint,3bf3ud,MagentaPaladin,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:30:45 2015 UTC,EvDo gaps? Try 1xRTT gaps.

Sprint,3bg48w,Zachnorn,2,Sun Jun 28 22:41:02 2015 UTC,You won't be able to do it a day early unless you pay off the entire balance of your hydro vibe (you still wont be able to upgrade tomorrow because it takes 3-5 business days for them to reset your eligibility once it is paid off).  On the 1st you are able to turn in the vibe and do easy pay on the g4. After that is complete the rep would do a 'flip flop' on the two lines and line 1 would have the g4 line 2 would have the s5 and would lose the ability for the early upgrade. your next upgrade would be in a year on line 1

Sprint,3bduvd,ANillegalALIEN,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:22:43 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, once the device is paid off in full you can upgrade.

Sprint,3bduvd,paperbanjo,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:19:29 2015 UTC,Right but thats the part that I get confused on. Do I have to pay off the balance of the installments or only to the point that would equal the 12 required payments?  Edit: I have the annual upgrade option on my plan

Purchase your device with Easy Pay and add the Early Upgrade option for $10 per month. After you've paid the $10 charge for 12 consecutive months, you can turn in your device and upgrade to a new device."

I did however see this and that is was made me chat with sprint then post here.   ""Can a customer upgrade their device annually on Sprint Easy PaySM? Tablets and mobile broadband devices are not eligible for annual upgrades.  Smartphones and feature phones may be eligible for annual upgrades while on certain qualifying plans. Log into My Sprint account on sprint.com for details. Note: The phone the customer gives back after the 12 consecutive installment payments must be the same or equivalent model that was subject to the original installment.""  Maybe it was just wishful thinking, but since that part ^ doesn't say consecutive months and since sprint lets you make extra payments figured I could make extra payments and upgrade a few months earlier. Lesson learned I guess, read the entire page. lol"
Sprint,3bduvd,Kohkan3,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:31:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I saw the section under another FAQ that didn't say ""consecutive months"", but I was pretty sure it did require the consecutive monthly payments (wasn't at work to check) and poked around to find more information that applied specifically to the $10 buy-up after you mentioned that's how you were getting the early upgrade."
Sprint,3bduvd,FiddlingCactus,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:33:03 2015 UTC,You can call customer care and pay off any installments you have or to just make extra payments.  It takes 3 - 5 business days for the system to reset eligibility once the balance is paid off.  The only way you'd be able to get a new phone without paying off the balance is if you have the give back option (most typical with the Family plan).

Make sure you get a Triband device: Samsung Galaxy S5/S6, LG G3/G4, iPhone 6/6+, HTC One M9 etc.  For example, the Galaxy S4 has a Triband version: [SPH-L720T]  As for the S4, do not get the version without the ""T"" in the model number. If you do, you'll be as unhappy as you are right now because the SPH-L720 only supports Band 25 LTE.    These new devices support Wi-Fi Calling and you can request a Wi-Fi Connect Router from Sprint which is optimized for Wi-Fi Calling. AFAIK, the router is free."

Sprint,3bcd7l,KidFenrik,3,Sat Jun 27 21:47:28 2015 UTC,I have the same plan but I get 25% off from corp discount.  260 isn't bad for 4 lines unlimited as that is like 60$ per line and 20$ in taxes don't know who is going to beat that.  Especially if you use a ton of data
Sprint,3bcd7l,takedownchris,2,Sun Jun 28 02:28:08 2015 UTC,"Adding to /u/aknutty's comment...  12GB would be best and give you a little wiggle room for data usage. You could go with 8GB but 1GB of overage is $15. If you use 9GB that's only $5 less than the 12GB plan each month.. if you very rarely go over 8GB then that plan may work for you, just keep your usage in mind. And it sounds like taxes are ~$25 on EDS 1500, so you'd be looking at 175 worst case if you dropped the insurance and haven't upgraded a single line on a 2 year service agreement on or after 8/22/2014 and have at least one line eligible for upgrade (there are eligibility requirements {the one I listed is not the only one} that if at least one line doesn't meet these requirements, you pay $40 for the every line instead of $15).  Just keep in mind that any future upgrades need to be done on easy pay or lease (pricing varies and does not include TEP/TEP+) or you pay an extra $25 for the lines that are upgraded under a 2 year service agreement.. and the $15 per line is a promotional price (normally $25/line, additional $15 for 2 year agreement). It doesn't expire after a year or anything but if you don't get that price while it's available, you pay $25 per line, and if you change your plan you'll lose the promotional pricing as well."
Sprint,3bcd7l,paperbanjo,3,Sun Jun 28 02:36:33 2015 UTC,Unlimited data for two lines is $100 + $40 each extra line.  So four lines is $180 before fees+taxes.    Only extra cost will be if you are leasing/easy paying devices.
Sprint,3bcd7l,MrNagant,5,Sat Jun 27 21:51:57 2015 UTC,"Which probably will end up being a lot more expensive over time. 4 phones At $20 per month puts them at $260 before insurance, taxes, govt fees, etc"

I'm not getting defensive just stating facts.   My opinion the best suggestions would be to stick with the ED1500 plan, if you aren't getting a discount for where you work -AAA or credit union look into that. It's an easy $10-30 in savings just for validating an id. If you are comfortable dropping insurance it's an option but weigh the cost if you need to get a new phone and don't have upgrades etc. a lot of customers are eligible for a 128gb iPhone 6 lease for 5 a month. That's a great deal as long as you are okay with a lease. If you don't want to lease 2year options are certainly still available."

Sprint,3b8ju4,B1GEast,2,Sat Jun 27 16:09:53 2015 UTC,"From Article:   Marcelo Claure, the Bolivian-born billionaire who was recruited to try to turn round struggling US wireless network Sprint, has become the highest paid chief executive in the US telecoms sector, earning $22m for seven-and-a-half months of work.  The pay package catapults him past Randall Stephenson, the chief executive of AT&T, the second-largest US carrier, who earned $24m last year, but for a full 12 months. Mr Claure earned more on a pro-rata basis.  Mr Claure was last year tapped to lead Sprint by Masayoshi Son, the Japanese telecoms entrepreneur who controls the network through SoftBank, and tasked with reviving the group which has been losing customers for most of the past decade.  He earned a basic salary of $923,000, a bonus of $2.4m, which included a $500,000 “golden hello”, and stock and options worth $18m, for the period between August 11, when he started, and March 31st, the last day of the company’s fiscal year, according to a regulatory filing.  He also billed Sprint $33,513 to use the company’s private jet for personal use, and received $14,887 in tax equalisation payments, $50,000 for legal fees, and $39,017 to relocate from Miami — where he is trying to launch a soccer team with David Beckham — to Kansas City, where the group is based.  Sprint’s shares fell 36 per cent over the same period as the company launched a price war to stop contract phone customers defecting to other networks with generous deals that took a toll on its balance sheet. In the first three months of this year, Sprint burnt through cash, sending its net debt up $900m to $29.6bn — roughly $10bn more than its market capitalisation.  A company spokesperson said it was difficult to make “apples-to-apples” comparisons of Mr Claure’s pay package with the sums earned by other telecoms executives, because it included various one-off payments, such as the signing bonus.  Mr Claure also received two years worth of awards under a long-term incentive compensation plan and would not be eligible for more until 2016, the person said.  Lowell McAdam, the chief executive of Verizon, earned $18m in 2014, a year in which his company’s share price increased 19 per cent, while John Legere at T-Mobile US received $19m for 2014, when the company’s share price fell 19 per cent.  AT&T’s share price fell 4.5 per cent last year.  Sprint also paid $11m to Dan Hesse, Mr Claure’s predecessor as chief executive, last year.     ""Golden Hello""? That's a new one...

Sprint,3b8ju4,KurioHonoo,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:25:43 2015 UTC,No. Sprint needs to increase density around sporting venues.
Sprint,3b8ju4,Draiko,2,Fri Jun 26 23:29:32 2015 UTC,Definitely but first focus on trying to get all major cities decent service first. Also more sporting venues should start providing better WiFi.
Sprint,3b8ju4,Photojared,3,Fri Jun 26 23:37:25 2015 UTC,I completely agree with the WiFi. The stadiums could invest in full coverage WiFi

I already average 100~120 GB of cellular data a month (12~15 TB on my home Internet). By 2020 I can easily see my data usage triple!   I mean just 10 years ago 1Mbps was considered fast... Around 2020~2025 is when 5G will become a thing most likely reaching speeds upwards of 1Gbps and the IoT will be a reality.   Some things (such as your phone) will need a 1Gbps connection with very low latency to function. Think about cloud based AR or VR (which will use huge amounts of data) or things we haven't even thought of that developers will make.   I could see something like smart phones being almost completely useless without a connection because ""your phone"" is actually on a virtualized server at Google or Apple and is just streamed to the device in your hand. That would allow easy upgrades (just add more CPU power, RAM, or disc space to the server) and app/OS updates instant.   I could see buying a ""phone"" in the future very cheap and you just pay a subscription to say Google for access to Android (could be included in carrier bill).   5G will make something like that possible because it is supposed to offer >1ms ping which is crucial to the IoT."

Spotify with average compression uses 50mb/hour. Throw in Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, iMessage, and Email and you can easily burn through 20gb+. This is why data buckets will not be sufficient as we find more uses for smartphones (especially for families).   For example, on Meerkat there is a Truck Driver in California that broadcasts his entire route daily using Sprint Unlimited. On Periscope I've seen live NBA games, Concerts, and Theme Park Walkthroughs. This wouldn't be possible without an unlimited plan. We should be pushing the limits not restricting them. You can't expect everyone to sit in their bedroom connected to WiFi."
Sprint,3b78u8,koalahumper,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:59:45 2015 UTC,I made a pretty good example of stuff like that here
Sprint,3b78u8,mitten_mike,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:15:24 2015 UTC,One hour of Netflix at the lowest quality uses 300mb   that's 60 hours of Netflix in 20gb. how the hell are people watching 60 hours of shows or movies in a month on their phones?
Sprint,3b78u8,B1GEast,2,Fri Jun 26 21:55:50 2015 UTC,"That's only 2 hours a day at the lowest quality. That is about how long my daily train commute is. If you have a job where you have a lot of down time, you might just turn on a season of your favorite show and watch it all day."

I get that a handful of people likely come close to 20gb, or hit 30 or 40, but 100gb seems impossible to me without tethering or downloading. I work in security, so I have loads of time to sit around, I get 10mbps at work, and I still can't manage to break 30gb, that's WITH downloading from put.io and a lot of Netflix and Hulu. 100gb is absurd.

RootMetrics shows them winning tons of awards for voice coverage, no dropped or blocked calls, and text. That shows the groundwork of the rebuilt network is second to none.

Sprint,3b7dx1,paperbanjo,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:11:01 2015 UTC,Oh? Where does it say this?
Sprint,3b7dx1,sparkedman,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:32:20 2015 UTC,"Probably isn't updated online yet but it is extended through August 6th. The $17 Best Buy credit is for the G4 starting July 1st, possibly one other device but the G4 is for sure."
Sprint,3b7dx1,paperbanjo,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:18:24 2015 UTC,"Off topic but I never could get a straight answer from NSS or the Leasing Department but if someone has an ASL but is still on a legacy plan and qualifies for the Loyalty Credit could someone essentially pay nothing for a monthly lease?  For example someone with an ASL has to put down a deposit on a device that normally would've been $0 and $5 a month (after $15 credit) but has to put down an amount and it is $8.55 a month, would it be -$6.45 reflected on their bill for leasing or no?"
Sprint,3b7dx1,YvesStLawrence,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:37:04 2015 UTC,"When you receive the loyalty lease credit, the credit is actually to your entire bill, and not to the lease payment. So technically, as far as the system is concerned, you're still paying the full $20 or whatever it may be for the phone.. you just also see a credit for $15 every month on the first page (or 10th if there's a lot going on on page 1) of your bill."
Sprint,3b7dx1,paperbanjo,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:55:59 2015 UTC,Oh I know all that but I just meant specifically for the situation in my question would of someone had to pay a deposit and their monthly leasing cost was $8.55 and they had a $15 credit would they see -$6.45 on their bill?
Sprint,3b7dx1,YvesStLawrence,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:14:51 2015 UTC,"Assuming the system allows the credit to apply in your case, you wouldn't actually see the total of -6.45 for the lease. The line has its pricing listed (plan and lease, plus add-ons), and the credit shows up in a different section. So maybe you'd see a cost of (just an example) $38.54 for the line with the lease on it, but your total bill is then reduced by $15. The line it self still shows cost of $38.54, not $23.54, since it's the total bill that's reduced with the credit."
Sprint,3b7dx1,paperbanjo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:40:15 2015 UTC,Oh okay that makes a lot more sense now. Thank you!
Sprint,3b7dx1,YvesStLawrence,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:27:58 2015 UTC,"Per device!  But it is paid out kind of weird.  So our bill is billed to us on the 5th, due on the 20th.  We bought one phone on the 12th of a month, and another on the 18th.  So in the 5th when we get the bill, we see it is $200.  Then on the 12th, a $15 credit appears making it 185, then on the 18th, another making it 170"
Sprint,3b6ezo,Envious684,2,Fri Jun 26 10:11:22 2015 UTC,Depends on where you are in PA. If you are in the West part of PA then I would never ever get Sprint. It's the absolute lowest priority of all markets with the bare minimum funding to keep the network running.  If you're in other parts of PA where Sprint has decent service then test it out and see for yourself and make an educated decision based on your experience.
Sprint,3b6ezo,lilotimz,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:44:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip, thankfully I'm in the northeast part of Pennsylvania"
Sprint,3b6ezo,qwerty12qwerty,4,Fri Jun 26 18:50:51 2015 UTC,"So as you may have heard from friends, Sprint isn't the best, however this is changing. They bet 5-6 years ago when 4g was emerging that WiMax would be it, as opposed to LTE.  So they half upgraded their towers, and 3 years ago, they sat with a crappy incomplete network with an outdated network, while their competitors upgraded to the latest and greatest 4G LTE.  So Sprint has something called Network Vision.  Go to every single tower. Rip out old T1 lines, replace with Fiber, and add THREE bands of LTE.  Now the higher the band's Mhz, the faster the signal travels, but the worse building penetration it gets.  The lower the Mhz, the better the penetration, but speed isn't as good as higher up frequencies.  Then there's the bandwidth.  Imagine it like this, 5 mHz bandwidth = 5 lane highway, 20 mHz = 20 lane highway.  During rush hour, where would you rather be?   So now the specifics if you want, if not skip on down.  Band 25: 1900 Mhz (Bandwidth 5Mhz) (Average range, medium bandwidth)  Band 26: 800 Mhz (Bandwidth of 5Mhz) (Great building penetration/range, medium bandwidth)  Band 41: 2500 Mhz, (Bandwidth of 20 Mhz) (aka ""Sprint Spark"", high speed/bandwidth, low range)  For perspective:  T-Mobile (700 Mhz has 10 mHz bandwidth, unsure about the rest)  700MHz, 1700MHz, and 1900MHz bands.  Verizon   1700Mhz, 700Mhz  Verizon's 1700Mhz is the ""XLTE"", where during peak time, 700 Mhz traffic is loaded off to.  //So,  Sprint has the comparable spectrum to really be one of the best.  They are also in the end stages of their ""Network Vision""  That is have B41 being used the most, for high speeds etc.  B25 for people who B41 can't pick up due to limited range, and B26 for people who work in heavily fortified areas.  How are your cities doing?  Well S4GRU tracks all this information so that we know how complete the network is! Sprint does Network Vision in ""rounds"", once a market has 30-40% LTE of B25, they officially ""announce"" the city as having LTE, and continue building and move on to the next round.  There are 4 rounds.  http://s4gru.com/index.php?/topic/212-network-visionlte-deployment-running-list/    Philadelphia is a Round 2.  Status:  LTE Launched/NV Upgrades Substantially Complete  NV Sites Accepted = 98%  LTE Sites Accepted = 84%  LTE Launched = July 30, 2013  Original Scheduled Completion = July 2013  Substantial Completion = October 2014    So, 98% of sites have been torn out and replaces, 84% have LTE, and last October is hit ""mostly done  Pittsburg is Round 4  Status:  LTE Launched/ubstantially Complete/Tunnel Sites Remaining  NV Sites Accepted = 99%  LTE Sites Accepted = 61%  LTE Launched = July 30, 2014 (New Castle launched 1/2014)  Original Scheduled Completion = Q2 2014  Substantial Completion = September 2014 So, 99% of sites had their core ripped out, and replaced with Fiber, 61% have LTE officially good to go    The S4GRU also for sponsors has maps showcasing the different bands of LTE.  Just by glancing at PA, I can see that you have a very good amount of B26 and B41 sites!  So PA is nearing completion!  tl-dr;  Sprint bet on the wrong 4G tech and fell behind, playing catchup now and has the stats for a kick ass network."
Sprint,3b6ezo,evan1123,2,Fri Jun 26 11:31:01 2015 UTC,"AWS is paired 2100/1700MHz spectrum, not just 1700. 2100 is used for downlink and 1700 for uplink.  700MHz band 12 on T-Mobile is 5MHz FDD, as is PCS 1900 most of the time. Some areas, like Cincinnati, have 10MHz FDD on PCS. All of the EDGE conversions are 1900 only, and they haven't refarmed any in urban areas yet. AWS on T-Mobile varies by market.  Verizon 700MHz is 10x10MHz. X-LTE is 15MHz FDD or 20MHz FDD. Load balancing is dynamic, so the phone is not necessarily on AWS only during peaks. The network is constantly balancing load between 700MHz and AWS."
Sprint,3b6ezo,qwerty12qwerty,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:12:44 2015 UTC,"I'm very familiar with the technology aspect of sprint with bands and mhz and all that, I live not very far from scranton, have any information on that market?"
Sprint,3b6ezo,jabberwonk,3,Fri Jun 26 12:13:40 2015 UTC,"So thie location of every single tower is available on the S4GRU website, any small donation of any amount lets you see the B25 sites.  Then $50 I think?  Makes you a premier sponsor and you can see all the bands, and the schedule.  So I can't go into too many specifics about it, but basically you have excellent B25 and B26 coverage there.  B41 is currently being deployed in the area.  So essentially that means all of Scranton has good LTE coverage, and are sharing 10Mhz of bandwidth, 5 on each band. Keep in mind 1 of Verizon's 700Mhz band is 10Mhz, so 10 is decent, speeds I guess would hover around 5-6 mbps.  Then when B41 comes with 20 Mhz of bandwidth... Well I currently get 50-60 mbps on B41 :)  B41 also takes the load off of B25 and B26, so those speeds will go up to 10-12mbps"
Sprint,3b6ezo,AJJ18,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:55:31 2015 UTC,"I work in center city Philadelphia and commute from the NW suburbs.  Around the area where we live service is bad - 1 bar, trouble sending / receiving text messages etc.  The towers aren't far away, we just seem to be in a dead zone.  Center city is OK though signal strength varies wildly.  I can watch Netflix or Plex all the way in on the train so I guess that's something.  Friends have other carriers and I don't see any real big difference between them."

Sprint,3b3stp,mitten_mike,2,Fri Jun 26 07:14:11 2015 UTC,Shortened for carrier aggregation.
Sprint,3b3stp,mitten_mike,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:10:09 2015 UTC,"To add, you have 3 bands of LTE.  B25 (decent range), B26 (great range/building penetration), each with 5 Mhz bandwidth (imagine 5 lane highway).  B41 (short range) has 20 Mhz bandwidth (20 lane highway!)  CA is your data using different ""carriers"" of B41, connecting to two seperate B41 cells.  Meaning your cell may be super slow because everybody is uploading data, but fast for download.  So your phone would connect to a secondary B41 that doesn't have an upload strain, but use the old one for download"
Sprint,3b3stp,zookkz,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:33:34 2015 UTC,"CA = carrier aggregation, meaning aggregation of carriers. a carrier is an antenna on a tower. aggregation of carriers means wrapping 2 signals together instead of the traditional 1. 2 simultaneous signals = more reliable signal to your phone, less congestion, faster speeds. it requires a specific radio on the tower and in your phone.  Sprint band 41 carriers broadcast 20mhz of bandwidth, by adding another carrier to the tower, they can transmit 40mhz, another would make 60mhz. your phone has to be able to pick up what they're broadcasting to make it work. the top of the line phone right now can pick up 3x20mhz (3 20mhz carriers simultaneously/wrapped together), Sprint is only activating dual carriers right now though, and no one really knows which markets they're doing it in."

Its odd, the tool I use normally gives some sort of ETA in terms of the date its scheduled to be installed. This tower however, is only telling me its not scheduled for LTE or 800 mhz.

Also the LTE speeds where it is available is quite underwhelming. And it is normal for the rest of you to only pull like half a Meg to 1 Meg down and up on Sprint's 3G?   If the family plan I was on wasn't so cheap and I wasn't so strapped for cash these days, I'd have cut and run a long time ago. I came from T-Mobile about 6 months ago and they had Sprint killed around here in both coverage and data speeds."
Sprint,3b48q9,lilotimz,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:33:00 2015 UTC,Unfortunately I i am not in the office until monday. Normally for 3g we look for speeds above 500-600. Most often then not speeds below that are because the t1 are at capacity and if there are plans to turn up lte on the site they do not want to spend the time and money to install additional t1s with fiber already on the way.
Sprint,3b48q9,roberts2727,-1,Fri Jun 26 04:34:56 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't surprise me. I'm sure they steal a lot, but a lot is also crowd sourced. I have tried submitting data but they want a LOT of information. All the towers in my area are live on 800 LTE but they do not show it. Dozens and dozens of towers. Plus there are new towers in my area they do not have listed. So the inconsistency goes the other way as well. But it is still nice to have. Better than nothing at all."
Sprint,3b48q9,mitten_mike,2,Sat Jun 27 17:37:29 2015 UTC,If we actually stole anything the site would've been shut down years ago. None of us have any access to Sprint internal tools and everything was given freely to us by Sprint employees of one type or another.   Not all information is up to date because source(s) don't send it all the time as Sprint is always on the lookout for leakers and tend to not be nice to them when discovered. Not to mention sometimes the Sprint internal databases are not actually accurate due to human factors and stuff tends to be corrected over time but that type of information is somehow missed since the S4GRU databases are manually updated.

Sprint,3b09nh,roberts2727,4,Wed Jun 24 23:42:19 2015 UTC,Actually unknown. Haven't actually paid close attentions to iphone field test screens with CA since the existing iphones can't do B41 CA (20+20) due to their CAT 4 modem.

Sprint,3b09nh,datajosh,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:13:42 2015 UTC,CA on the iPhone is really only shown as a different uplink/downlink frequency. You kind of have to know where the center frequency falls.

This is what Sprint has been waiting for.  How many carriers can Sprint turn on a signal 8T8R antenna? Besides denser deployment, this pretty much spells game over for all the other carriers. lol.    On the side, I did notice B41 being down on every tower I pass getting to work (7).  Maybe 2xCA updates being pushed!?"
Sprint,3b09nh,Vtrossi,5,Thu Jun 25 00:10:55 2015 UTC,6 individual carriers max for an absolute total of 120 mhz if the market had the spectrum.
Sprint,3b09nh,datajosh,2,Thu Jun 25 02:28:31 2015 UTC,"3 carrier max unless they use RF combiners.    Software updates are typically done in the early morning (1-2 AM) to avoid service interruptions, so seeing B41 down during the day isn't necessarily a sign.  If you watch your EARFCN on the engineering screen you can identify the second carrier, which will typically show up before CA."

Is the answer to port out and port back into someone's Framily?  Our data use actually isn't that high, I'm under 1GB/mo, and she's just under 2GB/mo. As to why she's on that 5GB plan I guess she just doesn't need the mins."

Sprint,3b1ani,jamar030303,4,Thu Jun 25 04:06:06 2015 UTC,"my complaint about the rather one-sided roaming agreement- Sprint users get charged to use the SoftBank network, their users don't get charged extra to use the Sprint network.    I don't think whether the customer is charged is part of a roaming agreement...that seems more like a carrier decision.  Sprint has decided to charge us.  It may just make more sense for Softbank mobile to not charge their customers based on their customer demographics and needs vs Sprint or maybe Sprint is using the money for something else."
Sprint,3b1ani,bestnameever,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:22:48 2015 UTC,"If Sprint isn't ""paying"" anything for the roaming agreement, then charging isn't necessary. Then again, if it was called the ""Network Densification Fee"", it may be slightly more palatable.... But not much."
Sprint,3b1ani,sparkedman,2,Thu Jun 25 10:51:08 2015 UTC,I think it is highly unlikely that sprint is not paying for users roaming on SoftBank.    Carriers even offer free roaming to the customers here in the states but the carriers are still paying for it.
Sprint,3b1ani,bestnameever,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:48:55 2015 UTC,There's no reason for Sprint to pay its parent company and majority owner for roaming. None.
Sprint,3b1ani,sparkedman,2,Thu Jun 25 15:24:53 2015 UTC,"There is actually plenty of reason.  Read up and learn about  transfer pricing.     Also Sprint is roaming off of  'Softbank mobile', which is operated independently from Sprint.  Why would Softbank mobile want to burdened with Sprints costs?"
Sprint,3b1ani,bestnameever,3,Thu Jun 25 15:42:06 2015 UTC,"Perhaps because Sprint is bearing the burden of SoftBank's customers roaming on it? On LTE, and with tethering allowed, no less (well, OK, this one is simply that tethering paid for at home carries over to the US and since I never bought any tethering allowance I don't know if the reverse is true). And no apparent condition requiring majority of usage still be on the ""home"" network- the lady at the SoftBank store I asked at said it was a hit with students studying abroad in America."
Sprint,3b1ani,bestnameever,2,Thu Jun 25 15:51:30 2015 UTC,I'm sure 'Softbank mobile' is paying for access.  It would actually be a way for Sprint to gain access to more capital.   I also know I wouldn't want another carriers costs to be part of Sprints financials if I was a stockholder.
Sprint,3b1ani,bestnameever,2,Thu Jun 25 16:06:02 2015 UTC,"In which case let's say SoftBank and Sprint had to pay each other for usage. If Sprint charged SoftBank an inflated price for ""roaming"" and used the extra wherever capital is needed, is it perhaps more favorable tax-wise compared to SoftBank funding Sprint more directly?"
Sprint,3b1ani,Mr_You,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:03:06 2015 UTC,I have no idea but that's a great point.  It could be more tax favorable to have the money sit in another country.  These would all be things they would look into.  The point is whatever roaming agreement exists probably involves money moving between entities.  Softbank is the parent company of both Softbank mobile and Sprint so I'm sure whatever is in place will probably favor them.    I think Softbank could even choose to run Sprint at a loss if it makes another one of their operations highly profitable but I'm no expert...just know these types of games exist.
Sprint,3b1ani,sparkedman,2,Thu Jun 25 17:26:10 2015 UTC,"There's no reason for Sprint to pay its parent company and majority owner for roaming. None.   You would  think this is the case, but the reality of the corporate world is that even internal, department to department, usage of time/services is taken out of the individual department budgets that is utilizing the service.  Mostly for specific skills vs company wide provided services like HR, IT, etc."

Sprint,3azhg9,B1GEast,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:34:22 2015 UTC,"From Article:   Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure met behind closed doors Monday morning with Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez, but officials said cellphones were on the agenda and not the Miami soccer stadium Claure wants to secure for David Beckham.  Claure, one of Beckham’s financial partners in the soccer push, pitched Gimenez and top aides Monday on a Sprint initiative to beef up its network and retail presence in the Miami area, according to county officials and a Sprint presentation.  ....  Against the backdrop of the soccer talks, Claure is also pursuing an expansion of Sprint cellphone service in the Miami area.  Claure wants city and county officials to expedite permitting and give Sprint access to government-owned buildings for some of the transmitters for the $75 million initiative, which would bring about 800 new cellular transmitters throughout the county during the next 18 months.  Sprint, based in Overland Park, Kansas, picked Miami as one of the roll-out cities for its improved network. The company plans 17 new stores in the area, according to the presentation Miami-Dade provided to the Miami Herald.  The plan revolves around Sprint using small transmitters on existing structures. The company also plans to utilize “monopoles,” which the presentation says are about 150 feet tall that and don’t require high-tension wires or metal frames. They’re used to “improve telephony connectivity in areas where zoning is difficult,” the presentation stated. Claure became CEO of Sprint in August, months after he and Beckham launched their bid to bring MLS to Miami.  Adding the transmitters would create 125 jobs, according to Sprint, and another 100 jobs would come from the retail side of the operation. Sprint is also partnering with MasTec, a prominent Miami company, to launch a “Direct to You” delivery service for setting up customers’ new phones.  “It’s a pretty incredible project, from what I’m being told,” said Hernández, the county spokesman. “In addition to improving their network, it’s also adding jobs in the area because you need the infrastructure and the workers to do that.”     Around 800 new cell transmitters in Miami alone? Yikes!  Interesting development. Follows in the footsteps of ""Sprint for Chicago"". I'll bet Miami is the next LTE-A city that launches.  I guess now we know who one of the contractors is behind ""Direct 2 You""."

Legere crying about Verizon and AT&T having an unfair advantage? that's exactly what he's begging for..  AT&T and Verizon got to where they are because Sprint made a poor choice investing in WiMax, and T-Mobile still hasn't found a parent / investor to bankroll network improvements. their decade+-long problem is exactly why they're in this current situation. the irony is unbelievable."

They are literally the only two major carriers in America. Sprint and T-Mobile SHOULD get an advantage just to be able to actually provide legitimate competition. I agree both Sprint and T-Mobile should have played their cards better in the beginning (Sprint didn't plan a head for network improvements and backhaul to towers) and lets not even begin where T-Mobile all went wrong in the beginning but that still shouldn't punish consumers by leaving them with two maybe three options are far as wireless carriers are concerned. And yes T-Mobile and Sprint may be bidding against each other in the long run but as the saying goes, The enemy of my enemy is my friend.   I mean you and anyone else can see it for how they want to see it. The fact still remains that competition is almost always a good thing and the wireless industry in America is suffering from the lack of it. You don't have to support it. If you want Verizon and AT&T to be the only carriers worth a damn as far as coverage goes, because the only other two carriers that have a shot at competing made mistakes in the past, So be it.   EDIT  Lastly I want to say, Yes, I support T-Mobile. They're my carrier of choice. They've done some major improvements over the last two years and I really like where the company is headed and how they're trying to shake things up for AT&T and Verizon. I was a Sprint user for well over 6 years before I switched to T-Mobile. I've always talked highly of both carriers even when Sprint had virtually no LTE coverage compared to everyone else.

The FCC blocked their joint bidding and spectrum reserve requests for the next big spectrum auction.  AT&T essentially killed Sprint's ambitions to purchase T-Mobile a few years back (Sprint was ready to pay $13 billion) by ridiculously outbidding Sprint ($36 billion) and entering into a situation that everyone knew wouldn't get regulatory approval. T-Mobile ended up with some AT&T spectrum and a few billion dollars for playing ball.  The FCC and the big boys are actively blocking any attempts at a friendly T-mo and Sprint relationship of any kind.

T-Mobile CAN have their 10x10; 5x5 from the reserve, and 5x5 from the unreserved. if they actually want that spectrum, they have to pay for it. maybe they should:   have sat the AWS-3 auction out, like Sprint did find investors to bankroll network improvements, or sell debt, like Sprint has not spend an arm and a leg trying to 'win' customers, as if they're going to bankroll network improvements not have started a race to the bottom on pricing   this isn't an 'industry problem', it's a Legere / T-Mobile problem.  while Legere argues it would help Sprint, it would help Sprint even more if T-Mobile was forced to spend money they don't have, stalling their network improvements and promotions."

Sprint,3ax8vr,stylz168,2,Wed Jun 24 18:54:32 2015 UTC,"To be fair, a lot of that is local and state governments passing laws regarding specific requirements for new entrants into the market that are insanely difficult to meet unless you're already big (like Google, and even then look at the Google Fiber deployments). If the barrier to entry is artificially high because the local government made it that way, they're the ones to complain to and get things changed. The FCC has nothing to do with each local area or state allowing new competition.  I'm just clarifying since I think a lot of the conversation for wireline broadband seems to place most of the blame on federal agencies when they have little to do with it beyond mergers like Comcast/TWC; they didn't have anything to do with Comcast lobbying your local governments to ensure they're a monopoly in the area."

Nothing will make up for T-Mobile's poor network planning decisions, especially after the AWS auction of 2006. The country was growing, and they drew the line in the sand and deployed HSPA+ only on their urban sites, and left the rural license protection ones on EDGE all the way till 2015. Those HSPA+ sites were the only ones to get LTE deployed as well, since the backhaul was already in place.  What folks are not understanding is that Verizon and AT&T's cellular deployment is only 1/2 of the equation, since they both went in afterwards and deployed more sites to support their PCS spectrum."

You should think about how great it would be if four carriers offered rural coverage instead of two. You should think about how wireless companies can innovate if they had fair access to spectrum. Why do you have such an anti-consumer rhetoric? If you've taken a course in economics surely you would have done case studies on government-granted monopolies.

Strategic alliances occurs when two or more organizations join together to pursue mutual benefits.   Sprint is bidding AGAINST T-Mobile for spectrum, how are you not getting this? Adding more spectrum will not benefit Sprint, it will benefit T-Mobile; Sprint already has enough money to outbid T-Mobile for what they want and Legere knows it, which is why he wants more added."

T-Mobile is the only carrier in financial trouble in this auction, and that's what this is about. Sprint has enough money to buy what they need. so does AT&T and Verizon. this entire manufactured 'revolution' Legere is crying about, is because they didn't save / raise enough $ to fund their purchase of spectrum they want, so they're trying to change the rules of the auction."

He plans to take the 2016 class of entrepreneurs to a new level with the Accelerator by offering the top three companies a place in Sprint’s world. Sprint partners on the Accelerator with TechStars, based in Boulder, Colo.  The 10-company class will have to duke it out to make one of the three winner spots, but it could pay dividends. Depending on the product, the companies could land the fruit of their labor on the shelves of Sprint’s almost 5,000 stores — or at least land on the company’s website, which Claure said yields about 40 million views annually.  “I want to make sure that we not only put our money, but everything that Sprint stands for to create success stories,” Claure said last week.  At the investor demo day for the 2015 Accelerator class last month, Claure announced that the 2016 class would be open to all mobile tech companies, not just mobile health tech.  The Accelerator is a point of interest for the CEO of the Overland Park-based wireless carrier. He’s spending a workday there this week to meet with the companies and the leaders who are housed there.  “I want to learn what they’re up to because that’s my core, that’s my essence, is as an entrepreneur,” he said.

The company did not immediately give any further details, including how Bye's departure will impact the carrier's network densification efforts and whether it would restructure its executive team.  Bye joined Sprint in 2011 from Cox Communications, shortly before Cox gave up on its wireless network buildout and sold its spectrum. Bye joined Sprint as the company's VP of technology development, reporting to Steve Elfman, then Sprint's president of network operations and wholesale.  However, Bye quickly rose through the ranks to become Sprint's CTO in charge of the carrier's overall network strategy.  Bye's departure from Sprint is just the latest in a long line of executive turnovers among the ranks of Sprint's network team. Last year, Iyad Tarazi, Sprint's vice president of network technology development and integration; Steve Elfman, president of network operations; and Bob Azzi, the carrier's senior vice president of networks, all left the company. Late last year, following SoftBank's acquisition of Sprint, Sprint appointed SoftBank executive Junichi Miyakawa to the newly created position of Sprint Technical Chief Operating Officer. He reports directly to Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure. Miyakawa previously led SoftBank's network operations, which--like Sprint--rely heavily on TD-LTE technology using 2.5 GHz spectrum.  When Sprint announced Miyakawa's appointment, the company said that Bye and John Saw, Sprint's chief network officer, would continue to lead their organizations at Sprint but would report to Miyakawa. Sprint said Miyakawa would oversee the company's network and technology organization, including associated strategy, network operations and performance. Interestingly, Sprint said he will also lead the carrier's relationships with key network equipment vendors-- Sprint outsources much of its network operations to Ericsson in a $5 billion, seven-year deal the companies signed in 2009.

RootMetrics drove a total of 1,247 miles and conducted more than 25,000 tests in Indianapolis.  Sprint has relentlessly focused on building and fine-tuning the network in Indianapolis. The company added hundreds of new 2.5GHz cell sites, and expanded its 1.9GHz and 800MHz 4G LTE coverage. Sprint’s network teams systematically optimized each cell site to maximize overall performance, coverage, capacity and speed.  In addition, Sprint improved service and upgraded the wireless systems in high-traffic areas such as Lucas Oil Stadium and the Indiana Convention Center.

Sprint,3aumj9,mitten_mike,0,Tue Jun 23 17:57:25 2015 UTC,"lol yes they can.   http://s4gru.com/index.php?/topic/6992-s4gru-members-average-monthly-data-usage-with-poll/  according to this (it's not scientific, but it's proof of concept), if Sprint capped data at 30gb, around 92% of their customers wouldn't be affected, while 5-6% could pay $10 more for a 60gb cap, and the other 2% could pay $10 more for no cap.  offering unlimited opens the door for abuse. 2% are using over 90gb a month, that's nearly impossible with regular usage, that is abuse. by doing away with unlimited, they can stop the abuse, and monetize heavy usage, without throttling access or speeds.   this MUST be done if they want to control congestion further down the road. now that their network is in better shape, and they're less desperate for customers, they need to slow the promotions and normalize pricing. profitability is as important as growing their customer base and improving their network.  as far as T-Mobile is concerned, they are becoming congested, so if they choose to offer unlimited, their service quality will suffer. Sprint has capacity they do not, Sprint can operate a really fast network AND offer loads of data, while T-Mobile will have to choose; unlimited data, or good service. considering they're not idiots, they will likely do away with unlimited data, or throttle unlimited data, or compress their video...well you get the idea. besides, T-Mobile already offers tiered data. they're already monetizing heavy usage. Sprint needs to do the same."
Sprint,3aumj9,B1GEast,2,Tue Jun 23 18:11:55 2015 UTC,"now that their network is in better shape,   This I agree with.   and they're less desperate for customers,   When did this happen?   they need to slow the promotions and normalize pricing.   No they don't. The network is getting faster, not slower, in spite of Unlimited and the promotions."
Sprint,3aumj9,mitten_mike,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:35:22 2015 UTC,"unlimited isn't destroying their network right now, I never said it was, but it WILL eventually, just like it did to AT&T, Verizon, and now T-Mobile. Verizon and AT&T make money on overages. Sprint can make money on heavy usage without throttling, or reducing access, or charging overages by tiering data.  it's not about congestion now, it's about managing congestion in the future by not allowing every person on the network to have unlimited FAST data.   if you don't want Sprint to die a horrible death from congestion or throttling like T-Mobile is/will, they need to tier data, and as far as most of their customers are concerned, 20gb, 40gb, whatever, is as good as unlimited.  you're also ignoring the lower tiers too; they're completely missing out on customers wanting service with Sprint for less than $60. Boost and Virgin are nice but they don't offer device financing or any of the other Sprint perks.  think of it this way; unlimited my way was $80. they lowered unlimited to $60 when people started leaving, now that they're gaining again, why not raise it back up to $80? there IS such a thing as too many customers gained too fast. they don't want a flood of unlimited data customers onto the network, and they don't want to miss out on potential profits from not raising prices."
Sprint,3aumj9,B1GEast,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:06:35 2015 UTC,"unlimited my way was $80. they lowered unlimited to $60    Didn't that $20 difference include a phone subsidy? It actually costs more now when you add financing or lease. Framily Unlimited was $45 and Best Buy One plan is still $45 (plus $20 lease).   Data usage is going to keep increasing so Unlimited becomes the price differentiator if you can't offer the same coverage as the big two. Getting rid of unlimited is getting rid of your only value price point. Verizon and ATT can still outprice Sprint because they have more coverage, so it would be stupid to eliminate the one thing driving growth."
Sprint,3aumj9,evan1123,0,Tue Jun 23 23:32:20 2015 UTC,"the $20 difference was ONLY for service, and it was even more because of the $10 LTE fee. it costs dramatically less now; I can lease an iphone OTD for $76, a Moto X 2 years ago cost me over $100 a month.  and yes, data usage IS increasing, which is EXACTLY my point. monetize the excess usage and separate those those use much less, which is a large segment of customers. it's diversification of pricing; $60 is a terrible catch-all price because it undercharges high usage, and overcharges low usage. why do you think every other carrier has tiered pricing?   unlimited is unsustainable. AT&T had it and lost it, Verizon had it and lost it, T-Mobile is now throttling customers in congested areas, Sprint is not immune to the same issues other carriers have and are dealing with.  unlimited data doesn't mean anything to most people, especially the ones using tiered data on other carriers. if a Verizon customer is paying $100 for 10gb on Verizon, they would STILL consider $70 for the same 10gb. the people who REALLY care about unlimited data are a niche crowd, they are the ones buying flagship phones the moment they come out, the people upgrading every year, the people who 'need' unlimited for their high usage. Sprint can and should charge them more than everyone else."
Sprint,3aumj9,B1GEast,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:52:15 2015 UTC,"monetize the excess usage and separate those those use much less, which is a large segment of customers.   That sounds like Duopoly talk. Why not pass on the savings instead? As a customer, I want to pay less for more data, why wouldn't you? Think like a customer not an executive, you don't profit if Sprint's stock shifts a few points.   $60 is a terrible catch-all price because it undercharges high usage, and overcharges low usage.   That would be no different from Verizon or ATT charging rural customers a higher rate than urban customers. If you start segregating usage like that, you should also charge people that live in Kansas more than they do in New York City.   If you want to move towards usage based pricing, then why not get rid of unlimited minutes and texting too? I don't need unlimited minutes or texting so give me more data in exchange. Give me 100 minutes and 20GB and you can have unlimited minutes and 5GB.   why do you think every other carrier has tiered pricing?   To nickel and dime customers because they have no choice in most markets. The major problem with tiered data is that you lose it every month. So if you're advocating for people to pay for what they use, then they should also get to KEEP what they paid for. that means no more overages and flat rate pricing. Right? There is a reason T-Mobile has stood out from the pack and avoid tiered pricing."
Sprint,3aumj9,mitten_mike,3,Wed Jun 24 00:08:49 2015 UTC,There is a reason T-Mobile has stood out from the pack and avoid tiered pricing.   T-Mobile has tiered data plans (with throttled speeds after data is used up) just like all other carriers. Many people don't need unlimited because they use so little data. Average data usage is somewhere around 2-2.5GB if I recall correctly.
Sprint,3aumj9,B1GEast,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:20:25 2015 UTC,"They are unlimited plans with high-speed buckets. They are unlike tiered plans that charge you an overage after you hit your limit. You can use as much as you like, purchase more data, or stay put. Traditional tiered plans penalize you for using too much data."
Sprint,3aviaa,Pete_ThaSkeet,2,Tue Jun 23 20:58:03 2015 UTC,"Lost/Stolen   You'll continue to make payments on the device and pay the penalty for turning in a damaged device/not turning in a device at all.  Most devices are in the $100 - $200 range.   Larger storage   Yes.  The loyalty thing is merely a static $15 credit when you lease a phone.  If you lease a phone that's $15, you're essentially paying just taxes.  If it's $35, the credit is still $15 and you're paying $20/mo.     Other info   After the lease expires, you can either pay the static buyout costs (again, $100-$200 generally) and keep the device or give it back and go about getting your new phone.  Leased phones have ""no value"" at the end so it's not going to be put towards the cost of a new device.  You simply return the old one and get a new one."
Sprint,3aw9b8,ruffbuff,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:30:54 2015 UTC,It could be a tower issue... But you can try ##72786# and then hit call (I can only assume you have an android). This will force a restart and the phone will go through the activation process all over again. Hopefully that helps!

I've had a ticket open with Sprint but they will not fix it. You can try opening a ticket and getting it to field engineering to try and fix the issue. The problem is they don't have enough tickets on the issue. Call 877-882-7401 to open a ticket.

Sprint,3aus2c,graesen,5,Tue Jun 23 17:56:22 2015 UTC,There are generally three kind of impediments to sprints lte 800 band 26 deployment.  First is international border regions where holders across the borders use the same spectrum for other purposes.    In the north and south borders it's public safety and private holders using it for Iden or other narrowband services which wideband technology like lte and CDMA will drown out.   In a few specific regions it's an exclusion zone mandated by the fcc due to a public safety agency still using the spectrum for public safety like emergency transponders or radios and whatnot.  Biggest remaining one is San Bernardino County and one in Phoenix Arizona which blocks a huge amount of area.    Third is spectrum squatters.  These are entities that bought the spectrum with no plan to deploy it really other than squat on it and wait til someone like sprint comes along and wants / needs it and extort money from them.  These are under litigation by sprint in the courts with a  large number of them being dispersed by court order and the spectrum allocated to sprint.  A few  remain like one in Puerto Rico which I will not name but the majority of them has been defeated by sprint over the  past few years.
Sprint,3aus2c,lilotimz,3,Tue Jun 23 18:19:28 2015 UTC,"There are certain areas that it cannot be deployed called the IBEZ, and other areas in Arizona that use the band for Public Safety.

Sprint will ""unlock"" the 4s and the 5, but they state they will give you an MSL code for that. The problem with the iPhone and ""MSL"" codes is that Apple does not use them and there is absolutely zero way to ""reprogram"" an iPhone. So, MSL codes are useless for iPhones.  What you can do is call international services and request an international unlock. Currently, most of the international unlocks for the 4s and the 5 have been converting into full unlocks. Why that is happening, I don't know, but it is.  Even if it does not for you, you still get an international unlock. It's just a matter of inserting the foreign SIM.  Beware though that some 4s owners have reported that once they get a full unlock it wipes out the carrier bundle for Sprint and so putting the device back on the Sprint network becomes impossible."

You still have the option of buying the phone for the 2yr discount price (about $200 for the average phone) but your talk and text will increase from $15 to $40. Either way you are going to add between $20 and $27 to your bill.   If this doesn't sit well with you, calculate your 2 year cost of service and phone ownership.

Sprint,3ak60k,KurioHonoo,2,Sun Jun 21 00:54:56 2015 UTC,I'll say it again and again.  I don't need super fast extreme speeds.  Just give me 3-5Mbps unlimited tethered data with decent latency (~30ms or less) at a reasonable price (~$40/month) and they'll have a customer for years to come.
Sprint,3ak60k,MJDiAmore,2,Sun Jun 21 18:00:41 2015 UTC,"This.    LTE over WiMax ala BluRay over HD-DVD was down to consumers not understanding wireless data needs (and/or having an interest in abusing them) and seeing the new shiny theoretical data rates possible.  So what that LTE could push 300Mbps theoretical and WiMax could only promise 1/4 of that?  WiMax had better range and more stability.    It boggles my mind when people demand faster service on mobile at the expense of things that are more badly needed - reduced latency and service consistency.    A streaming HD video will cost you about 3Mbps at the most (top quality tier NetFlix and others).  If I'm on the move, I will in theory only have my mobile device.  Maybe I want to share it with a friend or something so they can either watch or get something done, or I have a laptop with me for general productivity.  Productivity (web surfing, etc.) is not going even be 1 Mbps of bandwidth usage.  It's even more mindboggling when you consider that HD video is actually completely irrelevant on most phones.  Manufacturers have upped the pixel density beyond what the human eye can even perceive.  1080p to the phone just makes me laugh (and cry at the same time).  So why do I suddenly need 30Mbps mobile connection?   The answer is I don't.  And if everyone would stop demanding such nonsense, the  state of the industry would be far better for consumers."

Rootmetrics does not tell you that.   For example, ATT is in fourth place in Kansas City, but they would still be a better option over Sprint and T-Mobile if in-building or suburb coverage is important to you.

Anything over ~5Mb few people would notice, it is fast enough for an HD video stream, I've always said that.

I know you said wifi calling never works... have you tried it in other areas that have wifi? It could potentially be your router. If the router is the case Sprint has some programs in place to provide cisco routers to enhance your wifi experience.

Get the new Wi-Fi Connect Router from Sprint:   Wi-Fi Connect Router: Info and Quick Start Guide and Technical Guide and FAQ's   It's an ASUS router which has been optimized for Wi-Fi Calling. You'll be better off with this than an AIRAVE...  Follow these steps to improve your overall speed/coverage issues:  Android (using a Samsung Galaxy S6 as example)       The Sprint Zone App is pre-installed on your device.

If you are consistently bad, as in many months in a row, there will be some discussions.  Kind of tough to do that poorly. Turnover is fairly high, simply because it's a retail position.  People are more likely to quit than be fired though.   Would I recommend working at Sprint?  Eh.  I've worked for other carriers and Sprint is easily the worst in terms of internal systems (I've never had to utilize customer care/support as much as I have here), network (area dependent), and below average commission payout compared to the industry average (especially after the new commission change).  What Sprint excels at is, well, they have unlimited (no asterisk) plans and enough promotions that they could probably classify themselves as a discount store (downside is people expect everything for free or discounted so it's tougher to sell high dollar items).  This is a decent entry level position but I can't really recommend it.  You'd make more money, you'll be trained better, and have better options for other jobs (some companies in my area go after at&t employees because they know they train well and, typically, hire and retain quality employees) working at other companies in the wireless industry."

Sprint,3afn3t,sparkedman,2,Fri Jun 19 19:14:50 2015 UTC,"From Article:   Marcelo Claure is still an entrepreneur at heart — he calls that his true passion. At an event with about 2,000 of his employees Thursday, celebrating the recent report that Sprint Corp. has grown from worst to tied for the best network in Kansas City, the wireless carrier's CEO surfaced some of that entrepreneurial spirit.  If the network is doing so much better, then the excuses from salespeople about having a hard time selling because of the poor coverage must end. Claure said he hears that a lot. RootMetrics, an independent evaluator of all four major wireless companies, announced late Wednesday that Sprint is tied for No. 1 with Verizon Wireless in the Kansas City market. Sprint employees celebrated on Thursday.  ""I want to make sure that every single one of us becomes a salesperson, because every single one of us knows someone who is not a Sprint customer,"" Claure told the crowd at the celebration. So, he's incentivizing employees to be salespeople.  He held up business card-size advertisements that he's encouraging employees to hand out to everyone they know. And for every person they bring to Sprint, the employee and the new customer each get $50.     Thoughts? It'll be interesting to see how much employees make from doing this..."
Sprint,3afn3t,B1GEast,5,Fri Jun 19 19:16:46 2015 UTC,Sprint has had employee referral programs in the past like SERO and ERP. At least back then you could get discounted service. This is just a basic referral program for employees. Sprint already offers $50 for customer referrals. Instead of these one-time referrals why not lower rates by $50.
Sprint,3afn3t,B1GEast,2,Fri Jun 19 21:45:57 2015 UTC,Instead of these one-time referrals why not lower rates by $50.   $50? From what? You mean $50 off the iPhone Unlimited Plan?  The referred customer is getting $50 as well..
Sprint,3afn3t,sgtakase,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:14:29 2015 UTC,"Instead of turning your customers into recruiters, offer great service at a good price. This was the same mistake Marcelo's predecessor Dan Hesse made with that stupid Framily plan. He wanted to turn customers into MLM recruiters (bring in customers, we'll give you a discount). Look at T-Mobile or Cricket, people love the service and are more than happy to recommend it to others without the financial incentive because the service and rates are appealing. If they are willing to offer a $50 credit, they can afford to cut $5 or more from your monthly service too. I'm pretty sure people would be more willing to recommend service if they were paying less (I do it with Cricket all the time)"
Sprint,3afn3t,B1GEast,2,Sat Jun 20 03:47:51 2015 UTC,"Sprint's plans cannot get much cheaper than they are now. $60 for one line with unlimited everything, with no data throttling. That isn't a promotional price like the $50 iPhone plan, its the standard plan now. For the same cost with T-Mobile it gets you unlimited talk, text, and 3GB of 4G data excluding things like most music services. Plus if you are a credit union member or a AAA member that gets you an even cheaper plan through a discount.  The nice thing about this that not a lot of people know is that if you are willing to buy your device at full cost or bring your own device in, a no credit check option can be done, automatically giving 3 lines (With condition of ASL, which can be waived through Autopay and after 12 months gone altogether.) Which is a killer option for people moving from places like cricket or metro specifically because of poor credit.   I think Sprint is doing just fine on pricing wise for their service, the referral isn't necessary, but it is nice to get a little extra for spreading the word."

Sprint,3afn3t,MrNagant,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:31:26 2015 UTC,"If you're getting $50 as a referred customer, that's the equivalent of saving ~$4/month for the first year... So that's effectively a one year service rate cut.  You want Sprint to do more with less revenue?"

Sprint,3aeszg,radrake13,5,Fri Jun 19 17:05:31 2015 UTC,"Japan has done a much better job with spectrum than the FCC in the US has done (not saying the FCC has done a bad job necessarily, just that with consolidation in the industry over the last 15-20 years it's become a clusterf). The Japanese carriers have more contiguous spectrum they can use for wider bands.  The also have a lot less ground to cover. This helps wireless networks, but it helps wireline even more. The area of Japan is 145,925 mi². So if you compare that to the US at 3.806 million mi² that's a lot less space. Japan is roughly the size of Montana (145,552 mi²), and a little smaller than California (155,959 mi²). Running fiber to every site is easy when there is so little space overall. Instead of having to run a potential 1,000ft line from a trunk spot out to a site, often the length of those runs is less than 300ft, or even potentially right there already. With so much less space and high population density in urban areas it's the ideal place for a deployment like what Sprint is doing with TDD-LTE on 2.5GHz (in fact it's nearly identical). They also have a lot of areas that are underground or in tall buildings that necessitate DAS deployments, so the buildings are designed with that in mind as part of their construction, instead of retrofitting them after the fact.  Basically, Japan has done a good job at thinking about connectivity ahead of time instead of forcing the carriers to try and fix it after the fact. Japanese culture is much more focused on wireless connectivity, hell they've had the ability to pay for a soda from your phone for years, something we're just now starting to see, and even then it's a terrible system in comparison. When the urban culture is so reliant on that wireless connectivity, everyone tends to think about it when designing things."

Sprint,3aeszg,sparkedman,2,Fri Jun 19 18:48:47 2015 UTC,"I guess I don't understand.... But, if you can pay Sprint $5/month and roam in Japan (the idea of paying anything at all being put aside for the time being) with your current device, the basics are in place.  Seems simple enough:   It’s easy to get started:   Include the $5 Japan Roaming add-on to your international-capable phone Enable SIM for international voice and data roaming When in Japan set the device to GSM/UMTS Mode    Why does the experience then seem to suck?"
Sprint,3aeszg,Photojared,0,Fri Jun 19 18:53:33 2015 UTC,It's still international roaming. And international roaming is very different than domestic coverage. Seems like there's a known issue with it they're probably working on it.
Sprint,3aeszg,jamar030303,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:05:06 2015 UTC,"It's hardly an impossible thing. Similar arrangements exist in Asia already. For example, when I take a China Mobile SIM from Hong Kong to China, I get a local number and near-local voice, text, and data (near-local because data isn't censored like local Chinese SIMs) even though China Mobile HK is a different company from China Mobile in China.   Additionally, I've asked around and none of these problems seem to be happening in the other direction. Which if nothing else makes the SoftBank/Sprint relationship seem a bit one-sided, like they're in it only to cut roaming costs for their customers vacationing, working, or going to school in the US."
Sprint,3aeszg,jamar030303,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:00:32 2015 UTC,"Also, if they just removed the restriction on what phones the SIM could be stuck into, that would have helped immensely.

Source: https://www.t-mobile.com/OpenInternet   To provide the best possible experience for the most possible customers, and to minimize capacity issues and degradation in network performance, we manage Unlimited high-speed data usage through prioritization. Unlimited high-speed data customers who use more data than what 97% of all customers use in a month, based on recent historical averages (updated quarterly), will have their data usage de-prioritized compared to the data usage of other customers at times and at locations where there are competing customer demands for network resources, which may result in slower data speeds.   So what T-Mobile is saying is that it will deprioritize the ""Top 3%"".... Problem is, that just like there was for AT&T's initial scheme, there's always a ""Top 3%"". This amount, which will supposedly be adjusted quarterly, will only go down... not up. Because the ""Top 3%"" will be progressively deprioritized downwards. How is usage ever supposed to go up?   Based on network statistics for the most recent quarter, Unlimited high-speed data customers who use more than 21GB of data during a billing cycle will be de-prioritized for the remainder of the billing cycle in times and at locations where there are competing customer demands for network resources. At the start of the next bill cycle, the customer’s usage status is reset, and this data traffic is no longer de-prioritized.   21GB is supposedly the magic number for now...

Even better, if Legere was the Sprint CEO instead of Marcelo (Not sure I want that happening b/c Marcelo is awesome from what I can tell): Would Legere call BS on T-Mobile's deprioritization scheme, and say ""T-Mobile - You're throttling your customers.

Sprint,3aa296,Mr_You,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:10:44 2015 UTC,I agree that load balancing and adding capacity are also beneficial.  But here's the deal... most people would not notice this type of deprioritization.  Except on a tower with extreme congestion your traffic might be slowed down for only a few seconds to a minute or two extending to an hour or so for extreme congestion conditions (EDIT: at which point all customers are degraded regardless of prioritization).
Sprint,3aa296,sparkedman,3,Thu Jun 18 16:24:30 2015 UTC,"If someone is streaming on B41, and they add to congestion, there needs to be capacity added to the tower on B41, which is definitely something Sprint can do, because they have loads of spectrum on B41. If someone is streaming on B25 or B26, where Sprint only has 5x5 or 10x10, and it's congested, they could be bumped up to B41, where there is capacity. This would be possible at almost any tower. You would have a worse signal, but it will reduce congestion on the other 2 bands. Or they can always bump you to another tower, which will also affect your signal strength.  T-Mobile can do this too, but to a lesser extent. They have B4 and B2 where they're refarming, so if B12 becomes congested, and it will, because it's 5x5, they can bump someone up to B4 or B2. However, both of those bands can also be congested because T-Mobile doesn't have as much capacity as Sprint, they don't compress videos and they allow tethering.  This is why Sprint doesn't need to worry (in the near future). B41 is going to be available everywhere their other bands are (it's been proven to have similar propagation to B25), and it will relieve all congestion on the other 2 bands until all 100+ MHz they have is used, which is years away unless they gain millions of new customers.  They also employ compression of video to reduce congestion. Adaptive compression makes video streaming possible even on EVDO. It's not fantastic quality, but if someone needs to be bumped because they're drawing too much bandwidth, they just bump them to another band, compression kicks in, and the video keeps playing.  That's load balancing. Switching someone between towers and bands. Throttling just stops someone from using their data on all bands or on a given tower. It's a last resort when you have no extra capacity to utilize."
Sprint,3aa296,Mr_You,3,Thu Jun 18 16:09:02 2015 UTC,Like I said in my other comment.  B41 doesn't have the same propagation characteristics as B25 and B26 so you can't assume a customer can migrate to B41.  What we've been discussing is not throttling.  It's tower congestion and prioritization of customers based on their usage when there is already congestion on the tower.
Sprint,3aa296,sparkedman,3,Thu Jun 18 16:28:22 2015 UTC,"they CAN though, you can be switched over to B41 or EVDO. 125dbm is about the minimum you can pick up B41. if a tower has B41, and your B25 signal is around 110-115dbm, which is considered poor, you can typically get 115-125dbm of B41. it's going to kill your battery, and be slower than typical B41, but it's entirely possible (again, this is not a likely scenario, but it's entirely possible). I get about 95-100dbm of B26 at my work. I can definitely force my phone over to B41 and still manage a signal at around 121dbm. It's not fast, but sometimes it's faster than B25 or B26, especially when they're both congested during the day."
Sprint,3aa296,sparkedman,3,Thu Jun 18 16:31:27 2015 UTC,I'm skeptical.
Sprint,3aa296,Mr_You,3,Thu Jun 18 16:47:10 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/a/dAMga  I'm on B26 99% of the time here (at my apartment). I can force my phone to B25 or B41 and still get usable LTE.   I'm on B26 most of the time because of a site density issue btw, so in order to fix this, they need to add more sites. That will decongest B26 and B25, and I won't have terrible speeds on B26, and I might even rest on B25 or B41. If they didn't have B41, it would stay congested. But since they've added B41 sites around town (just not near me), B25 and B26 are both faster than they were."
Sprint,3aa296,sparkedman,2,Thu Jun 18 16:49:40 2015 UTC,And as part of Sprint's announced Network Densification Plan... those sites are coming...

Sprint,3aa296,sparkedman,2,Thu Jun 18 17:17:41 2015 UTC,"T-Mobile leaves you deprioritized for the rest of your billing cycle....  If this sounds familiar, it's because AT&T does the same thing. See: AT&T Unlimited Data Support Article   Reducing data speed (data throughput) and network management are common practices in the wireless industry. How we are managing the network only affects a small minority of the heaviest smartphone data users still on unlimited data plans - more than 97 percent of our smartphone customers are not impacted by this.  You can still use an unlimited amount of data each month without incurring overage charges That won't change. As a result of AT&T's network management process, customers on a 3G, 4G or 4G LTE smartphone with an unlimited data plan who have exceeded 3 gigabytes (3G/4G) or 5 gigabytes (4G LTE) of data in a billing period may experience reduced speeds when using data services at times and in areas that are experiencing network congestion. All such customers can still use unlimited data without being subject to overage charges, and their speeds will be restored with the start of the next billing cycle. Even with reduced speed, customers normally can still have a good experience surfing the Web, accessing email, and continuing to use an unlimited amount of data each month without incurring overage charges. Customers will likely notice the biggest difference while streaming video. Streaming video consumes the most data of all activities and is often the reason customers are treated.     So: three things.... 1) T-Mobile is pulling the same stunt AT&T is.... 2) As with AT&T, it lasts the rest of your T-Mobile billing cycle.... 3) It's interesting how AT&T claims 97% of customers are supposedly not affected by this ""reduced speed"" over 5GB of usage .... and you square that with how the Top 3% of T-Mobile customers are by T-Mobile's deprioritization, which takes effect at 21GB of usage (Source).....      And then you realize: Legere worked at AT&T for nearly 20 years... All he did was take off the suit and put on a Magenta Shirt....  ICYMI: Read this about his ""makeover""....   Legere’s official debut came four months into his tenure, at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January 2013. He had already started to loosen up his wardrobe now that his customers were millennials and not milquetoast CIOs. ""Open coat, nice collared shirt"" is how Legere’s longtime friend David Carey, T-Mobile’s EVP for corporate services, describes Legere’s first steps toward finding the clothes that would make the man. ""It was very Silicon Valley–like,"" he says.  But Legere began to worry he still looked like too much of a suit. ""We were up in the suite,"" Carey says, recalling the night before T-Mobile’s press event at CES, ""and he said, ‘What should I wear?’ And I said, ‘I don’t know, look at me. What the hell are you asking me for?’ "" The two fiftysomething dudes bantered for a bit, until Carey suggested ""this cool hipster kind of sport coat that he had just gotten."" Legere was receptive but still flummoxed. ""What shirt?"" he asked. Carey told him, ""I’m not a fashion guy, but I think you’re supposed to wear one of those T-shirt kinda things to get that cool look going.""  Legere came up with a twist. What if it was a magenta T-shirt with a giant T on it? Vegas, baby, Vegas. They had the T-shirt made overnight.  When he showed up at the Venetian hotel the next day for his first public introduction to the technology industry as T-Mobile’s new CEO, Legere had accessorized the hip sport-coat-over-a-T-shirt look with a dangling silver chain and a chunky white plastic watch.

Sprint,3aa296,Mr_You,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:18:54 2015 UTC,I think what you're failing to realize is that if you fall into the deprioritization category that you may never even notice it because the tower congestion may only last a few seconds or minutes (see my other comment) because of the bursting traffic of a low usage customer.
Sprint,3aa296,Mr_You,3,Thu Jun 18 16:17:25 2015 UTC,That's not the point... This deprioritization scheme lasts for the remainder of your billing cycle.
Sprint,3aa296,sparkedman,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:19:48 2015 UTC,Why wouldn't it?  I can't emphasize this enough: Your service is only impacted when there is already congestion on the tower.
Sprint,3aa296,Mr_You,3,Thu Jun 18 17:34:00 2015 UTC,"So who decides what constitutes sufficient congestion?....  By the way, what happens as that ""Top 3%"" at T-Mobile keeps getting Deprioritized?....  For right now, it kicks in at ~21GB of usage.... not for long... That usage amount is going to go down, not up, over time....  T-Mobile says  it will be ""Updated Quarterly""...   Unlimited high-speed data customers who use more data than what 97% of all customers use in a month, based on recent historical averages (updated quarterly), will have their data usage de-prioritized compared to the data usage of other customers at times and at locations where there are competing customer demands for network resources, which may result in slower data speeds.    ....   Based on network statistics for the most recent quarter, Unlimited high-speed data customers who use more than 21GB of data during a billing cycle will be de-prioritized for the remainder of the billing cycle in times and at locations where there are competing customer demands for network resources.    oh sure... Data Strong.... That's funny..."
Sprint,3abkli,sparkedman,2,Thu Jun 18 19:42:40 2015 UTC,"See: Video of Marcelo being interviewed  Some interesting tidbits/data/Marcelo quotes from the Article:   For the first time since April 2011, Sprint has reason to crow in its home market. And it plans to do just that, starting Friday.  The Overland Park-based wireless company got good news this week about its network’s performance here. RootMetrics, a network tester based in the Seattle area, ranked Sprint’s service best in town in a tie with Verizon Wireless.  Before dismissing a tie as something akin to kissing your sibling, note that Sprint hadn’t topped RootMetrics’ twice-a-year Kansas City rankings in seven tries.  “You’re going to see us being proud all over town,” Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure told The Star on Wednesday before the rankings were public.  Armed with the new report, Sprint plans a big push to win the hearts and minds — and especially the cellphone business — of the area’s cellular citizens.  Claure said to expect “something” at Friday’s Kansas City Royals game against the Boston Red Sox. (Is it a coincidence that Verizon’s color is red?) Keep an eye open at Sporting Kansas City’s upcoming home games, too.  Part of Sprint’s improved local network performance stems from increased service at the stadiums. RootMetrics’ ratings look at network speeds — where Sprint has gained ground — reliability, data, call and texts.  Sprint also plans to launch a social media sweepstakes Friday to mark its network-backed effort to win local customers. The promo asks residents to post selfies with whatever makes them proud of Kansas City. Use the hashtag #KCProud.  Offline, watch your mailbox. Sprint’s planning a letter campaign to appeal to its hometown audience.  Sprint’s local push comes as it struggles to stay ahead of fast-growing T-Mobile to remain the nation’s third-largest wireless company by subscribers. Both finished March with about 57 million subscribers, with Sprint having slightly more than T-Mobile.  At home, however, Sprint dominates.  Data from ShareTracker LLC, near Columbia, show that Sprint claimed 31 percent of cellphone subscribers in this market at the start of the year. That’s the largest market share among the four national carriers and twice the 15 percent market share Sprint claims throughout the nation.  T-Mobile has about 24 percent of the market in its hometown, the Seattle area, but that’s only good enough for third place there, ShareTracker president Eric Fogle said.  Clearly, many Kansas City area cellphone users already like Sprint.  The Westport Flea Market switched to Sprint last month, noting on Twitter that both companies were “homegrown.”  Claure said Sprint currently is winning only about 15 percent of those who sign up for service the first time or switch carriers in this market.  “We should be at 50 percent,” Claure said.  Claure, on the job 10 months, has said he wanted to make an appeal to area consumers as the hometown wireless carrier. But he has waited until the company’s network would impress them. The RootMetrics report became the launching point for the campaign.  ....  Sprint’s improving network ranking lends credence to the somewhat sheepish “pardon our dust” message that Claure’s predecessor, Dan Hesse, offered as the company updated its entire network infrastructure.  With that work over and improvements following, Claure has been able to adopt the optimistic mantra “getting better every day.” He says he constantly runs into area residents who tell him they used to be Sprint customers. He’s counting on the hometown appeal — and the better network — to win them back.  “This is a place where a lot of people were not proud of Sprint. They’ve lost that pride,” Claure said. “Our goal basically is to regain that pride, and you regain it by having great products.”     This is so awesome... Looking forward to seeing what Sprint does at the game on Friday....  The new TriBand DAS at Kauffman Stadium has made a huge difference I'm sure....  Anybody here going to Friday's game?"
Sprint,3abkli,tanmaker,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:51:47 2015 UTC,"“This is a place where a lot of people were not proud of Sprint...""   This has a lot more to do with the amount of layoffs and not the quality of the network, but that didn't exactly help the company's case. If you live here, it's rare to not know someone affected by the layoffs of years past.  I'm glad they're finally stepping up their game here though. I can't wait to upgrade to a Spark phone to do some tests around town. As of right now with my S4, I still get pretty poor signal at work and home, both of which are <3 miles away from HQ."
Sprint,3abtss,mengy007,3,Thu Jun 18 20:49:41 2015 UTC,It's amazing how some Reps just totally refuse to even look at that reddit post by SprintEmployeeAMA
Sprint,3abtss,Photojared,3,Thu Jun 18 21:54:53 2015 UTC,Every rep I've talked to says they're getting a error about how the device is incompatible with the Sprint network. I'm online with an international rep who seems to know a bit more.
Sprint,3abtss,paperbanjo,3,Thu Jun 18 22:31:37 2015 UTC,Finally able to get an international chat support supervisor to create a ClickIT ticket to get my ESN back into the Sprint database. Should take a few days. Will update thread when I hear back from them.
Sprint,3abtss,sparkedman,3,Thu Jun 18 23:24:55 2015 UTC,"That's what needed to happen. Sometimes the ESN gets removed from the system when it's de-activated. Don't know why, but it happens"
Sprint,3abtss,sparkedman,3,Fri Jun 19 01:02:54 2015 UTC,"Sounds about normal, honestly. International works a lot with unlocking devices so they should definitely know the process to getting your issue resolved.  When I was a Care rep, we basically were never given any information about ClickIT tickets and their uses. The way it was presented was it was something that only tech support did (which is wrong). Of course, this may vary by call center location, but now that I've moved out of Care, it's frustrating to know all the inconveniences that could have been avoided if reps were given a bit more training or capabilities.  In any case, the Nexus 6 is definitely one of those devices that are expected not to be swappable right off the bat because they aren't carrier branded. And if you take any phone and unlock it and use it on another network, you're probably going to run into the same problem trying to re-activate it on Sprint. Fortunately, seeing that the device was actually active on the network in the past usually speeds up the process (don't have to try to convince someone that you should be able to use it on Sprint's network because it's seen more as something weird is going on because it used to be on the network.. if that makes any sense). The ticket should take care of the issue for you. :)"
Sprint,3abtss,sparkedman,2,Fri Jun 19 04:49:26 2015 UTC,Glad to hear. Let us know!
Sprint,3abtss,SprintEmployeeAMA,2,Fri Jun 19 18:58:47 2015 UTC,"See this reddit post by /u/SprintEmployeeAMA  Sprint needs to load your ESN. Show the rep this post, or find someone who knows how to do it.   The proper way to get an ESN loaded is by having the store or Care file a ClickIT ticket. The name of the ticket they need to file is ""ESN not found / ESN not loaded"".  Turnaround time is usually ~3 days once the ticket has been filed.  When activating, the MEID is the IMEI, but leaving off the final digit. So, an IMEI of 9912345678901 would use 991234567890 as its MEID to activate on Sprint."

Sprint,3a93l4,martyrfx,2,Thu Jun 18 05:07:56 2015 UTC,You can buy an off contract phone that works on Sprint and use that.
Sprint,3a93l4,rebelx,2,Thu Jun 18 05:38:52 2015 UTC,"You can place the line on seasonal standby ($8.99/mo) as long as it doesn't leave only 1 line total on EDS 1500. There is a limit to the number of months you can place the line on standby (6, followed by 3 months back on a plan before standby can be used again) and standby freezes the contract as well until it's taken off standby, meaning you can't just place it on standby until the contract ends.  You don't have to keep the same phone you got under contract on the line.. you can swap it to another device if you have one available.  I am confused though.. you said she's not on the plan anymore? So how are you being charged for it? And yes, your step mother can take over her line, just need to have a device swapped onto the line."
Sprint,3a93l4,paperbanjo,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:47:26 2015 UTC,"She's not on the plan anymore as in she doesn't use it. She and her husband are on their own now, so we just have a dead line pretty much."

Sprint,3a9cdf,jonrpennington,6,Thu Jun 18 06:54:08 2015 UTC,"Your post makes you sound a little close minded. You should really consider the leasing program as it would give you the unlimited $50 rate plan. So you would pay $20 for the phone each month (or $25 for the plus), $50 for the rate plan and $11 for insurance if you want it. On the lease you won't have to put any money down on the phone if you're well qualified. Where as with easy pay, you must pay taxes up front.   I'm not sure what plan you're currently on but in most cases the new plans are more cost efficient, especially for single line accounts. So you may want to think about moving over to a new plan.   Also, you'll have 14 days to return the phone. Keep in mind there will be a $35 restocking fee no matter what. And if the device isn't returned within the first 3 day you'll be charged an activation fee for the iPhone and Nexus."
Sprint,3a9cdf,Scruffy_McHigh,2,Thu Jun 18 08:16:40 2015 UTC,"iPhone 6(+)'s get the $50 rate plan no matter how you buy the phone (as long as you switch to it, ofc). Just add the cost of leasing or easy pay, or $35 for the contract."

I have a fully-stocked Framily plan, including my in-laws, who pay $60 total per month for both of their lines. If I hang them out to dry, their plan cost increase means that they'll have to disconnect their home DSL, because they can't afford both. Basically, the extra $30 that I pay with my three lines covers their DSL bill, and I'm OK with that."

Sprint,3a9cdf,Scruffy_McHigh,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:23:13 2015 UTC,"Well if the Framily plan is fully stocked (10/10 lines) then removing one line off the Framily plan won't effect the rates on the other lines. So you could save a few bucks there by switching to the $50 plan.   If that's not the case then my other points still stand. The leasing option will save you money up front and should you decide you want own the phone after two years, you won't be paying anything more than you would have paid on easy pay."
Sprint,3a9cdf,rbe15,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:08:00 2015 UTC,"I thought about that for a minute, then I realized that I'm not fully stocked, I'm only fully qualified (7/10). My number is also the kingpin of the account. I just can't do anything.  Leasing looks interesting, but I'm already paying for unlimited data which also gets me annual upgrades. Is a lease that flexible? There's no way I'll want to buy a two year old phone that I've already been using for two years. :)"
Sprint,3a9cdf,sparkedman,2,Fri Jun 19 03:22:40 2015 UTC,"You will absolutely pay more money to stay on your current plan than if you opt for an unsubsidized rate plan, especially if you plan to purchase the phone on Easy Pay.  You don't have to surrender your current phone. You can do what you want with it.  You will have 14 days to return or exchange your device."

Sprint,3a9cdf,sparkedman,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:14:31 2015 UTC,"As /u/rbe15 said, staying on your current plan and going Easy Pay will cost you more money per month...

You should be aware that the Monthly Plan cost for the Unlimited Plan for non-iOS devices is $60/month, as shown on this page.    Another option....  For iPhone 6: Stay on current plan, do a Loyalty Service Credit Lease from Best Buy. Applying $19/month service credit makes the iPhone 6 (16GB) cost $1/month for 24 months. You have the option to buy the phone at the end of the Lease as I understand it.  For Galaxy S 6: Stay on current plan, do a Loyalty Service Credit Lease from Best Buy.

Specmap is a great resource but there's a fair bit missing for specifics and such. /r/tmobile' u/danrant built a phenomenal site/map that's an excellent resource for T-Mobile spectrum and such, but it's just for that carrier. I know that s4gru and t4gru are great sites for info but I really want a neutral ground for aggregating information in a convenient location (Reddit).   If all of these resources, and more, can come together in one spot with intelligent conversation, we'll all gain something. I think that the paradigm right now is like having a bunch of subreddits for specific enthusiasts' cars but no as subreddit for people who like all kinds of hobby cars. Continuing this analogy, I'm advocating the notion that bringing all of the best hobby car info into one area, the greater community benefits from things like 'where to buy the best wax/tires/accessories' or 'this is a great drive to go on for x route' and so on.

Sprint,3a62sc,MrNagant,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:06:54 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering the same thing about HD voice.  I think the reason that Sprint's voice quality score is decent on Circuit-Switched is because of all the new Network Vision gear they rolled out. That and HD voice.  As the article states, most of its competitors' legacy gear for Circuit-Switch is quite dated.  I'm hoping that VoLTE is easy to deploy on Sprint's new gear."

The tools Care use without actually doing a swap aren't 100% reliable. But the system they use to actually perform the swap will be. And yeah, make sure all things AppleID are signed out/disabled right in front of you.  If the seller won't allow you to attempt to actually swap the device before receiving any sort of payment, I wouldn't do it. Red flags.

Sprint,3a0q52,sparkedman,3,Tue Jun 16 09:08:15 2015 UTC,"From Article:   OVERLAND PARK, KS — Sprint has hired Golin as its lead agency as the American telco giant looks to modernize its network to regain competitive standing.   .....  Golin has been working on the seven-figure business for several weeks now, following a competitive review. Sprint works with several agencies, but Golin is now taking the lead on its consumer strategy and creative services work. The remit includes corporate communications, executive visibility, multimedia, crisis, media relations, employee engagement and CSR initiatives, CEO Fred Cook told the Holmes Report. The business is led from Golin’s Chicago headquarters with teams spread throughout the country.   Last November, former Visa CCO Doug Michelman joined Sprint as SVP of corporate communications after a brief stint at Finsbury.   Golin previously worked with Sprint more than a decade ago, under a different management team at the company. More recently, the agency's telco experience has been via its work with Metro PCS before its T-Mobile acquisition, plus previous work with Verizon and a global remit for Nokia.  As Sprint rolls out its revamped network, several PR issues are likely to come into play. For instance, the cost of the new network will probably force Sprint to either abandon — or raises costs — on its unlimited data plans.     It'll be interesting to see Sprint's new communications strategy. So far, I think they've really improved the website. I've seen the new shopping experience pop up at times. Looks like it's still undergoing testing.  However, some of Sprint's legacy and current content is a mess. Hope someone is making a checklist of items to fix..."

It'll cost you about the same as what you pay now to AT&T or less... and you'll have Unlimited Data, which is frankly liberating.  For example: The iPhone 6 (16 GB) is $20/month on a 24 month Lease or $27/month on Easy Pay (24 monthly payments).  So doing the math: $100 for the plan for 2 lines... Add in the phones either way you want, and it's a pretty good deal: $140/month if you lease the 2 devices (iPhone 6 16GB) or $154/month if you do Easy Pay. This is before taxes, etc.  Even better, Sprint's also offering this as a ""Web Special"" per the website: WEB EXCLUSIVE: FREE MONTH OF SERVICE WITH SPRINT LEASE. NEW LINES ONLY."

Then they have the 2 year agreement option, the plan doesn't increase, and they own the phone.

You have the option to buy the phone at the end of the Lease as I understand it. 3) Switch to Unlimited Family and then Lease/Easy Pay devices.  Doesn't seem to make sense to pay $220 out of pocket for a contract instead of $24 over 2 years by leasing with the Best Buy Credit.  OP could perpetually lease a phone at $1/month for the next 220 months (That's 18 Years and 4 Months) for the 2 year contract price of $220, assuming the pricing stays the same.

Edit: I feel like that's kind of a grey area because they're discriminating against P2P downloads, but at the same time they aren't slowing down just P2P downloads, rather all of it.

It rather give you something that nothing. When you are in an area with a lot of people, if a particular tower is very load, it will implement something called Cell Breathing, in which it shrinks it's coverage to try to have your phone pick a stronger signal. Unfortunately this doesn't always work like expected, either due to people moving through that tower fast, or other conditions. Cell Breathing starts, and stops, your phone sees a weak tower and chooses not to connect.  Someone correct me if I am wrong on this one."

Every reason I've ever seen posted on why you should turn it off has been refuted with evidence that is actually improves battery life unless you are always turning WiFi on and off manually. Not to mention the tracking it does for LTE sites so when you are in an area your device has connected to a better connection previously, it will force a new LTE scan instead of waiting for the timer."
Sprint,39tfsj,halcyoncmdr,2,Sun Jun 14 19:41:28 2015 UTC,"Only reason I, (not OP) messed with it was when I was in college, my bus stop from my apartment got a whiff of my home WiFi but not enough for a consistent connection. My phone would also get hints of the school's WiFi as I drew nearer and passed buildings. Ended up being so inconsistent that I turned it off. Way better in newer phones though. I have basically no issue with it these days."
Sprint,39tfsj,contreramanjaro,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:53:12 2015 UTC,"haha this exact thing happened to me. it learns your wifi usage, so I turned my wifi off a couple times and it stopped trying to connect to it."
Sprint,39tfsj,mitten_mike,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:28:37 2015 UTC,"The feature is redundant. Android already connects to best available connection. The connection optimizer will connect WiFi regardless of connection quality. The only benefit is that it does auto-login to some WiFi points that require input. It's borderline malware because unsecure WiFi access points are susceptible to man in the middle attacks. You risk data theft if the app keeps forcing you to WiFi and transmits data on unsecure APs. Sprint does it so that your phone remains off the macro network as much as possible (especially WiFi calling devices). It for their benefit, not the customer."
Sprint,39tfsj,B1GEast,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:18:24 2015 UTC,"Define ""Android connects to best available connection"". In all of my experience and training, here's how it works:   Connect to saved WiFi connections. Scan for other available WiFi spots nearby (if you have this setting enabled). Connect to mobile network. 3.1. Connect to LTE if available (going through the LTE preference list, not necessarily in Band 41>25>26 order depending on phone model). 3.2 Connect to other available mobile connections working it's way back through the list of technologies (so on Sprint it would go EvDO Rev. A > EvDO Rev. 0 > 1xRTT).   Android always prefers WiFi if available, and will not automatically connect to unsecured WiFi hotspots, you have to manually connect to them unless you have them saved previously.  The Sprint Connection Optimizer does not affect any of this, all of these work exactly as they do whether you have the Optimizer enabled or disabled.  What the Optimizer does do is: 1. Keeps a list of previously connected WiMax/LTE/WiFi sites (depending on phone type obviously) and the location you were in at the time. It stores an accurate location if there is already a recent GPS lock (it does not request a new GPS lock), general location if the GPS data is stale, or only network-assisted general location information if the others are not available. 2. It uses that list of locations and compares your current location as accurately as possible (again, it will not request a new GPS lock, it simply uses whatever information is already available at the time) to see if you're in a location it has previously connected to a better signal. It does this periodically just like the built-in Android WiFi scanning does if you have that enabled. 3. If the location you are in matches up with a known better connection, it will override the built-in LTE and WiFi scan timers to force a new scan and get you from 3G back to an LTE connection, or to WiFi which Android would then automatically connect to just like if the Optimizer weren't enabled and you had WiFi turned on.  It does not constantly leave your WiFi scanning. It does not require you to micromanage your WiFi toggle every time you leave home/work/etc. Basically it learns where you have what connections then automatically tries to connect to what it knows is there if you aren't already connected to the best option there.  The WiFi auto-login isn't even a primary feature of the Optimizer, and was not even in the original version released. That was added to streamline connections to hotspots you may frequently connect to that require web logins (like for road warriors that are often at hotels, etc. using the provided WiFi).  The macro network offloading is one of the main reasons it was added, but it is not the only purpose. It basically just expands the built-in Android stuff and adds overrides for Sprint-specific network bands (because Android doesn't care about LTE Band differences beyond the initial scan to acquire an LTE signal).   You risk data theft if the app keeps forcing you to WiFi and transmits data on unsecure APs   For it to do that, you have to already have that unsecured AP saved, just like the built-in Android WiFi scanning. It literally does nothing difference from a stock Android device in this regard, despite what you seem to think."
Sprint,39tfsj,halcyoncmdr,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:03:11 2015 UTC,I have found that the connection optimizer automatically connects (and logs me into) airport Wi-Fi (specifically Boingo Wi-Fi) when I have never connected before and have no plan with them.   Edit: it also connects logs me into xfinity Wi-Fi without me having ever told it to connect or me logging in with my comcast account.
Sprint,39tfsj,koalahumper,-1,Thu Jun 18 07:22:58 2015 UTC,"I don't need my phone to do any of that. That's the point. Sprint is the only carrier that loads this bloatware on their phones.  Like I said, it is not a feature for the benefit of the user, it is for the benefit of Sprint.   It doesn't even save battery because it has to use CPU cycles to run its software in the background and activate the radio. Overriding Android to search for Bands is a HUGE battery drain (especially if you are in a poor connection area). It shouldn't do that.   Here is some real-world data showing the battery life on various carriers. Sprint is in third place on all the tests."
Sprint,39tfsj,B1GEast,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:02:36 2015 UTC,"So then you disable it. It isn't inherently a bad feature however like you seem to make it out to be.  Also, I don't think you understand the true definition of bloatware:     Bloatware is the slang phrase used to describe software that has lots of features and requires considerable disk space and RAM to install and run. Webopedia  Software that is overpacked with features and therefore slow or unwieldy; software that is inefficiently designed and occupies an excessive amount of memory or disk space. Wiktionary   It's a 740kb app that actually does improve the built-in Android features, and does not reduce performance in the process. That's neither excessive disk usage, or reduced usefulness. Sprint is also the only carrier that decided to deploy their LTE network and allow consumers to be able to use it during the deployment as soon as it was online instead of blocking connections until they arbitrarily decided they would ""flip the switch"". The application is designed to assist with connecting to those sites when you can back in range to reduce the amount of time you spend on 3G instead, something Android itself provides very little support for.  In addition, the only reason it can't be uninstalled is because it requires system privileges to operate, like Sprint Zone, and Google doesn't provide an alternate way to do that in Android. The other Sprint-added apps are all now able to be uninstalled if you don't like them, something the other carriers still haven't all implemented as far as I'm aware."
Sprint,39tfsj,halcyoncmdr,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:17:09 2015 UTC,"Because you edited to add more...   Overriding Android to search for Bands is a HUGE battery drain (especially if you are in a poor connection area). It shouldn't do that.   Did you not read what I wrote? It only overrides to force a new scan for LTE if you aren't already connected to LTE. Once you are on LTE the network controls band placement. It can override the built-in LTE scan timer to force a scan (instead of waiting the ~30 mins or so it normally would between each scan) when you are in an area the device has connected to LTE before.   Here is some real-world data showing the battery life on various carriers. Sprint is in third place on all the tests.   That test doesn't talk about the Connections Optimizer, it's a general battery test; and doesn't specify anything about any software like the Optimizer. Their methodology states that their only preparations were to make sure WiFi is disabled (but doesn't specify whether any sort of WiFi scanning is enabled, either something like the Connection Optimizer or manufacturer options). It also shows their only attempted testing control for signal is to ensure the device has at least 3 bars. Considering ""bars"" are an extremely inaccurate form of signal measurement (essentially just a legacy visual indicator for the average user since that's all the average consumer understands for signal) that doesn't take the signal quality into account, it's not a controlled factor in their testing and can cause noticeable differences in battery life.  They also state this at the end of the write-up:   While we don’t know for certain why T-Mobile phones last longer on a charge, there are some strong possibilities. T-Mobile’s network could be more efficient at sending and receiving data because of the bands it uses, or maybe there are far fewer customers on its LTE network, easing the strain. Another possibility is that T-Mobile tends to pre-load less bloatware on its flagship devices relative to the other carriers.   So they state that the T-Mobile devices have better battery life, but they don't know why, and take a stab at guessing it's network-related, possibly related to the frequencies used or congestion essentially.   However, a cleaner software load likely doesn’t account for such a big difference in battery life from one carrier to the next. There’s something else at play here. Whatever the reasons, we’re certainly not complaining.   So they just said it could be bloatware... but then say it's not likely the software loaded that accounts for the battery differences.    How about you see about a comparison with a Sprint device that has the Connection Optimizer enabled and an identical device with it disabled, with identical testing scenarios (like the same trip through a city, etc.). Any other sort of test would have little to nothing to do with battery usage increases from the Connection Optimizer, unlike how you seem to be claiming the battery differences are coming from the Optimizer specifically."

They always had to transfer me five times, or make me repeat my entire situation five times, or make me fax documents and wait a week for manual verification. Theyd always say ""i cant do that"", and requests would never get resolved.  We're talking simple requests like ""your website shows plan X. Can you switch my out of contract phone line to that plan."" Or, ""I want to activate my Nexus 5 on a new line."" Or, ""please add a tethering package to my phone"".  That's not to say other people's CS is better - it's not. But other carriers let you manage your own stuff online, so I never need to call them.   Sprint doesnt. No matter what they claim, every minor change requires at least an hour on the phone with CS. Their website is effectively useless - it only allows bill pay, you can't do anything else with it.  So yeah. Bad experience with Sprint CS."

Even if it took a while a customer will be infinitely happier if their issue is fixed the first time they call in instead of having to call multiple times.

With Verizon, it was basically 1 troubleshooting step (reset phone), and then tell me to go to the store for a similar activation issue.  It took about an hour and a half in the store for them to figure it out (their system showed another phone activated). Everyone with Verizon had very poor customer service skills.

Twice I had switched my number to another carrier (I think it was Cricket once, and MetroPCS the other), my number was fully ported out for a week, and Sprint CS was able to quickly transfer it back to Sprint and reopen my account just as I had left it, all within a couple hours. When I transferred my number in initially, it took about 15 minutes, yet when I had T-Mobile, it would take them DAYS to transfer a number (I had T-Mobile $30 prepaid since it came out). I haven't had a single instance of improper billing either (in fact they waived my initial activation fee).   If you want to know terrible CS, try MetroPCS. I was hung up on regularly. So much so that it was the reason I left. I would get to a dead end in their automated service, and it would just say ""goodbye"" and hang up on me. Cricket has terrible CS too, loads of unexpected charges. I'm sure Verizon and AT&T have great CS, but they're so expensive I've never had the opportunity to try either of them."

They have no online presence (chat is useless). They have no social media reps. Their store reps have to use chat to fix problems. I've actually been hung up on by phone reps. FFS this list ranks the carriers with the worst calling times (indicating high wait times and numerous issues) as the top three. This is despite the fact that T-Mobile makes social media a larger priority than the other carriers (including the CEO himself who responds to customers).

Both of the old iPhone 5's are functioning fine.  In regard to Activation/iCloud lock, this is simply if you are restoring the phone. It's a security feature so that unauthorized users cannot access your phone. As long as you know the Apple ID and password used on that phone, if you restore it, you'll get back in fine.

Now we're back to speed being an issue. here's my speedtest results, native SoftBank vs Sprint roaming. Three guesses which is which.   As for factors not under your control, I'd be asking why other providers can seem to get this figured out a lot better. I've been to Japan quite a few before with T-Mobile roaming with no trouble. I switched to Sprint because of the $5 unlimited option that wasn't supposed to have any throttling imposed on it. Heck, using my Hong Kong SIM in Japan has always been turn on phone-enable roaming data-go. It just charges me through the nose for phone calls and data roaming is something like a flat US$7 daily but for that price I get 1-2M down and 750k up.  I don't expect perfect service and 40 down/5 up while roaming on SoftBank. I do expect service that works. The sub-100k speeds (Google Maps took 10 minutes to load a local map) and the fact that I've had to call in to Worldwide Care both times I've been to Japan in the past two months is making me reconsider my switch from T-Mobile. I'll be returning to America In a couple of days and coming back to Japan a third time at the end of the month. If I have to call Worldwide Care a third time as well it may end up being the last straw for me.   EDIT: although truth be told, I'd be switching to Project Fi rather than back to T-Mobile if my invitation arrives soon enough. I really want to give them a go and see if they work better."
Sprint,39gtsy,sparkedman,2,Thu Jun 11 21:51:39 2015 UTC,Speeds have NOTHING to do with Sprint. Sprint enables the service. That's it.
Sprint,39gtsy,sparkedman,2,Fri Jun 12 03:40:28 2015 UTC,"And why would SoftBank deliberately provide worse speeds to its own subsidiary as opposed to outside companies? Additionally, this agreement is reciprocal, and after asking out of curiosity at a local SoftBank shop, apparently no one going the other way (SoftBank->Sprint) has seen such low speeds or the provisioning issues I've seen.   I'm giving this two more chances this summer- once in Tokyo at the end of the month when I leave the US again for Europe (I know, I'm going the long way around), and once again in Osaka and Tokyo on the way back in August. If I have to call Worldwide Care for help again both times I'm ditching it.

You're getting the best possible experience as there is no SIM lock, no carrier branding of any kind, and even better, absolutely no Sprint bloatware gets installed via VPL. This may have something to do with the fact that Sprint Zone (the company's equivalent to a ""my account"" app) requires system-level integration and thus is not available for download on Google Play. It comes pre-installed on the system partition of just about every Android device Sprint sells that isn't called Nexus, and it updates itself automatically.

The supervisor was not able to verify that they indeed had to add the MEID to the system or whether it was a lingering complication of it still being linked to Freedompop, the prepaid carrier who sold me the refurbished phone. I had gone through appropriate steps to remove any carrier lock by them before, so it shouldn't have been that.  Still the steps I took to success were 1) have them submit a ClickIt ticket with all my phone MEID, serial, model, SKU numbers etc to have it added to their system and then 2) bug the hell out of them asking for update on status of ticket 3)the last rep a week after ticket submitted transferred me to supervisor who clicked a button in the ticket to escalate. He said he'd call back later, which he did and was able to activate! Not sure if he had any other contact with the team working on the tickets.  Still shocked it worked...I had the Swappa listing ready to go..."

The iPhone 5S/5C is a dual-band LTE device and does benefit from LTE on band 26 (800Mhz) and CDMA on band class 10 (800Mhz) for improved voice/text/2G/4G coverage and building penetration.  Most Sprint customers will gain the benefits of B26/BC10 upgrades over B41 (2500Mhz) upgrades.  Previous iPhones are single-band only (1900Mhz, no 800Mhz capability) and the new iPhone 6/6+ are tri-band LTE capable."
Sprint,39idq3,Mr_You,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:33:46 2015 UTC,Thank you for correcting me. You have 2 800mhz on the same band? Or did u mean 1900mhz in the first paragraph? My understanding is 800 isn't deployed yet. I cant wait till it is. I cant get a decent lte signal on 1900 in my condo unless i put it up next to my window
Sprint,39idq3,IamwhiteB,2,Sat Jun 13 16:27:39 2015 UTC,"800Mhz will definitely improve coverage in your condo.  You can contact Sprint and/or an employee in this subreddit to see if your nearest tower has been upgraded.  I think they need your street address and zipcode.  Just to clarify, there is no 3G on 800Mhz.  There never will be.  Only voice/text/2G/4G.  B26 and BC10 are deployed and continuing to be deployed nationally except near the International Border Exclusion Zones (IBEZ).  I think they expect B26/BC10 to be completed network wide by the end of the year.  The new management is now prioritizing B41 (2500Mhz) upgrades in areas with 1900Mhz spectrum congestion.  There might be technical jargon that I'm not aware of, but instead of specifying the exact frequencies that a carrier is using you'll often see just the ""base"" frequency being referenced.  I could look it up, but basically band 26 (LTE) and band class 10 (CDMA) run on different frequencies somewhere within the 800Mhz-850Mhz(?) range that Sprint owns licenses for.  Verizon and AT&T also have ""old"" spectrum around 850Mhz which will eventually be redeployed for LTE.  As more and more customers purchase LTE phones, Sprint will also partially redeploy 1900Mhz 3G for 4G LTE.  EDIT: I don't think this requires any tower modifications, only software configuration changes and maybe minor antenna tuning(?) if anything.  For me personally, I want a phone that is compatible with as many of the U.S. carriers bands as possible so I have the option in the future to use any of them (either long-term or short-term) without purchasing a new phone.  The carrier specific phone racket in the U.S. is so frustrating.  Only the iPhone 6/6+ and Nexus 6 are capable with the current Nexus 5 being Sprint/T-Mobile/AT&T capable.  Trying to hold out for a 2015 Nexus 5 with hopefully full compatibility."
Sprint,39idq3,Mr_You,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:51:14 2015 UTC,Why would iPhone 6 or older not get network upgrades but 5/5c would
Sprint,39idq3,Mr_You,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:26:47 2015 UTC,Huh?  Read the rest of the thread?   iPhone 5 and lower are single-band phones.  iPhone 5S/5C are dual-band phones.   iPhone 6/6+ are tri-band phones (Sprint Spark).

According to the RootMetrics Report for Chicago, Sprint's performance is pretty competitive with the other carriers.  Chicago will also be the first city Sprint upgrades for its LTE-Advanced deployment through the Sprint for Chicago initiative.   CHICAGO (BUSINESS WIRE), March 30, 2015 - Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Sprint (NYSE:S) today announced a series of investments in Chicago that will bring jobs and infrastructure investments to the city over the next two years. This investment plan – known as Sprint® for Chicago – will bring more than 300 new jobs to neighborhoods throughout Chicago by the end of 2015 and includes the installation of hundreds of new cell sites and an expected investment of $45 million in its network infrastructure between now and the end of 2016.  ....  Chicago will be the first Sprint city upgraded to an even faster network with the deployment of LTE Advanced technologies. These faster speeds are expected to improve the performance of video and other bandwidth-intensive applications, including new generations of online gaming, virtual reality and advanced cloud services.  New cell sites will be located in neighborhoods throughout the city and include the areas around Rush University Medical Center, along Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) subway routes as part of the project to upgrade the wireless network in the City’s system, and areas surrounding Garfield Park.     To supplement this coverage, Sprint also offers Wi-Fi Calling on iOS/Android (except for Nexus)  Does Wi-Fi Calling Support Messaging (SMS & MMS)?   For Android devices, messaging is supported in Wi-Fi Calling mode even if there is not any coverage from the Nationwide Sprint Network.  For iOS devices, messaging is still handled by the Nationwide Sprint Network. If you do not have coverage then messaging services are not supported. This functionality is expected to be supported over Wi-Fi in the future. iMessage on iOS is supported over Wi-Fi."

Just go to a Sprint corporate store and ask for help activating your phone, and they'll give you the correct SIM and make sure the activation goes through properly.  To make sure that your device doesn't have any funny business associated with it, check its serial number against the iCloud activation lock database. If the phone doesn't pass that check, you need to contact the seller and tip off Swappa. The phone should not be IMEI blacklisted because Swappa checks that. If it is(which is very unlikely), again, contact the seller and Swappa."

Per the FAQ, there are additional benefits to Wi-Fi calling support:   Does Wi-Fi Calling Support Messaging (SMS & MMS)?  For Android devices, messaging is supported in Wi-Fi Calling mode even if there is not any coverage from the Nationwide Sprint Network.  For iOS devices, messaging is still handled by the Nationwide Sprint Network. If you do not have coverage then messaging services are not supported.

However, if you decide to join a random Framily (whether it's the store rep placing you on one from another customer they have assisted {technically not supposed to do that} or through the subreddit linked in another comment), be aware that some information about you can be shared with the other Framily members. You can join the Framily if you have the ID availabile if you're in store.. I don't know about online. It can probably be handled through Care as well but I can't say that with 100% certainty anymore.  2) Yes, but there are ""no credit check"" accounts as well. There may be a deposit for you.. you can figure out the deposit requirement during the credit check before the account creation is completed (not to mention 14 day satisfaction guarantee if you create the account).. the amount of the deposit varies. I'm not at work so I'm not able to access the information regarding no credit check accounts and I don't work with them often so I don't know much about them off the top of my head.  3) Yes. $36. Waived by having a verified Credit Union account and having the CU discount on your Sprint account. Other discounts (such as through employers) may waive this fee so you can call Care and have them look into the discounts available to you, but CU waives it guaranteed. There are also sometimes promotions to waive them (like with a port in).  4) On Framily, each line is $55 before discount. 7 lines on one Framily (max of 10) reduces the cost of the line by $30 ($5 discount per line on framily, 7-10 is $30 off). With Unlimited on a Framily of 10+, that would be $45 (Unlimited is $20). This also does not include the monthly cost of the phone, or the additional $15 charge on the line if you sign a 2 year service agreement instead.  5) No. Each line chooses their own data. Also, if you make your device payments on time every month and stay on Unlimited data for 1 year on this plan, you can upgrade at the 1 year mark. It's an early upgrade perk.  6) It is truly Unlimited.  7) Some plans have hotspot included (Family Share Packs for example), but no unlimited plan will have hotspot included. You need to add the hotspot service and the price is based on your plan and the hotspot options (data caps) for your plan. I don't know the options and prices off the top of my head, sorry. You do not need a separate device to have hotspot services, but that is also an option and it would definitely cost extra as well."

Moffett 'expects them to burn through $4.5b in cash this year' because Claure said that's exactly what he's going to do.  He's basically saying ""Sprint's cash burn is out of control"" when in reality, they're transferring cash on hand to equity. Cash is an underutilized asset in business. You want to invest cash in a way that will increase returns. Ex: You have $20 in cash. Is it a more efficient use of that $20 to just hold it? or spend that $20 on a shovel and shovel driveways in the winter? Your shovel is still there, it's still worth around $20, and after the first driveway you shovel, your assets (shovel + cash made from utilizing the shovel) = $25+. That's what Claure is doing; spending excess cash on their network.   ""It's no secret that Sprint's 2.5 GHz spectrum hasn't lived up to the hype of two or three years ago, at least so far,"" Moffett wrote. ""Siting and other deployment hurdles have continued to trip up 2.5 GHz deployment in dense urban centers, arguably where the high-capacity spectrum would be the most valuable. Never mind that Sprint has been so cash-strapped that any serious network upgrade would have had to have been shelved anyway.""   That entire statement is a flat out farce. THAT is why people don't like Moffett. Sprint is NOT short on cash, in fact, they're burning it as planned because they have excess cash.   It's idiotic. He says ""they're burning a billion dollars! they're doomed!"" then immediately says their network isn't improving. what do you think they're spending that billion dollars on?! do you think it just disappears?!  Moffett is an analyst. His job is to speculate, not to be correct. He makes money from clicks, not good information."
Sprint,397bze,mitten_mike,2,Wed Jun 10 00:38:18 2015 UTC,"Exactly right /u/mitten_mike. See this article from January 7, 2015 in which Marcelo is quoted:   He also said the company would start to operate with a smaller cash reserve than it has. Currently, it holds more than $5 billion in its cash accounts, even when it owes $30 billion in debt, but Claure wants that reduced to no more than $1 billion in cash on hand.  “We’re going to run this business a lot tighter,” he said.     I think Moffett just chose to ignore that... I mean, I won't pay for his report to see if it's there."
Sprint,397bze,halcyoncmdr,2,Wed Jun 10 00:45:25 2015 UTC,"they had 15% of their total liabilities in cash. they're not at ALL in financial trouble, cash burn has nothing to do with long-term viability, and Moffett should know that. Sprint has loads of debt, yes, (that quotes says $30b, which could be close), but they're valued at 133+% of their debt and have no trouble making interest payments. that's another thing. if I buy a house for $100k, and make $30k a year, am I close to insolvent? not at all. neither is Sprint, because total debt has nothing to do with being able to make interest payments. their current ratio (assets to liabilities) hasn't been below 1 since 2007, it's .84 right now.

Sprint,397bze,halcyoncmdr,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:57:22 2015 UTC,"Infinite monkey theorem:       The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type a given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare.  In this context, ""almost surely"" is a mathematical term with a precise meaning, and the ""monkey"" is not an actual monkey, but a metaphor for an abstract device that produces an endless random sequence of letters and symbols. One of the earliest instances of the use of the ""monkey metaphor"" is that of French mathematician Émile Borel in 1913,  but the earliest instance may be even earlier. The relevance of the theorem is questionable—the probability of a universe full of monkeys typing a complete work such as Shakespeare's Hamlet is so tiny that the chance of it occurring during a period of time hundreds of thousands of orders of magnitude longer than the age of the universe is extremely low (but technically not zero).  Variants of the theorem include multiple and even infinitely many typists, and the target text varies between an entire library and a single sentence. The history of these statements can be traced back to Aristotle's On Generation and Corruption and Cicero's De natura deorum (On the Nature of the Gods), through Blaise Pascal and Jonathan Swift, and finally to modern statements with their iconic simians and typewriters. In the early 20th century, Émile Borel and Arthur Eddington used the theorem to illustrate the timescales implicit in the foundations of statistical mechanics.

Sprint,397bze,B1GEast,2,Tue Jun 9 23:57:50 2015 UTC,"Moffett DID say they need to sell it, not only that, but that it wouldn't be enough to save them from certain doom. He's been saying that for the last 2 years. He's been wrong about Sprint so far, why would anyone listen to what he's saying now?"
Sprint,397bze,B1GEast,2,Wed Jun 10 00:19:09 2015 UTC,Selling some spectrum would also mean 2 carriers requesting support for the band (lower cost devices) and purchasing equipment.    So you mean the Competitive Carriers Association plan to have CCA member devices be compatible with all of their member LTE bands in the next couple of years doesn't qualify? That's a lot more than 2 carriers.
Sprint,392993,sparkedman,4,Mon Jun 8 18:55:51 2015 UTC,"As a Sprint customer in Austin, TX, I've never had any service issues that was their fault. Calls have always been  clear as a bell. No lost text or MMS messages. Really, just a great experience overall.  I do agree the overall data speed should be better, but it really depends on where in the city you are. But as small as apps and pictures are to send, I'm actually OK with it. Like text and MMS, I've had no problems with sending/delivery with data services.  The only service problem I have had has to do with where I work. Once I'm actually at my desk, I have 1 bar and that flickers. Then again, I'm behind a few security doors, so...  The only non-service issue I've had is that it took them  over a month to process 2 phones (traded S5s for S6s) I returned for out yearly upgrade. I kept getting messages that threatened to put my account in collections. All because the credits for those phones were not applied in a timely fashion. got it fixed 2 weeks ago, but I'm still a little irritated about that.  So that's basically my Sprint experience over the last 3 years in a nutshell."

Sprint,392993,Ascertion,3,Tue Jun 9 08:47:05 2015 UTC,"From Article:   AUSTIN, Texas (BUSINESS WIRE), June 08, 2015 - Sprint today announced that its network in Austin, Texas, received shared 1st place ranking for overall performance, reliability and call performance, along with an outright win in text performance, according to a new RootScore® Report by independent mobile analytics firm RootMetrics®.  Since RootMetrics’ previous test five months ago in Austin, Sprint’s median download speed increased by 27 percent. As for call performance, Sprint did not record any blocked calls during testing.  In 101 markets measured in the first half of 2015, Sprint has been awarded a total of 139 first place (outright or shared) RootScore Awards for overall, reliability, speed, data, call, or text network performance.     Awesome job guys!  Anyone here in Austin?"

Sprint,392993,evan1123,3,Mon Jun 8 19:06:41 2015 UTC,Agreed.  Saw this on the RootMetrics Report:   AT&T’s median download speed decreased from 21.3 Mbps to 12.3 Mbps since our testing in December.   vs.   Sprint’s median download speed increased from 8.5 Mbps to 10.8 Mbps.     That's a huge speed drop for AT&T... And Sprint hasn't even fully deployed its Band 26 and Band 41/2x20 Carrier Aggregration yet.

Basically there's three questions that we have to choose from when accepting a phone for buyback or turn in. ""Does the phone turn on"" ""Is the phone is good working condition (no broken screen, lcd, charging port, etc)"" and ""Is the battery included"". Normal wear and tear (everything you described) doesn't matter.  Also hardware/software alterations isn't replacing the battery or sd card.

Sprint,38nqk1,sparkedman,3,Fri Jun 5 12:07:04 2015 UTC,"From Article:   The health side of the Sprint Mobile Health Accelerator program is going away. All mobile tech startups will be welcome to apply for next year’s class.  Sprint chief executive Marcelo Claure made the announcement Thursday evening at the conclusion of the 2015 program’s demo day. The 10 companies in this year’s class pitched their companies to potential investors and others at the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts.  “I’m a believer that mobile is, and is going to continue to be, the biggest enabler of human progress,” Claure said at the event’s conclusion. “I want to make sure we open it to the world of mobility.”  Claure also has plans to broaden the accelerator program’s notice, in part by opening its customers up to the companies’ products.  “I’ve already seen a couple of companies that I would love to put their product in our 5,000 stores and just help them grow,” Claure said.  The invitation, he said, is open to entrepreneurs outside the accelerator program too. Claure said he wants to open Sprint’s doors to help spread the innovation and “cool stuff going on in this city.”   .....   The Sprint accelerator is in the Crossroads Arts District in Kansas City and run by Colorado-based Techstars. It is an intensive, three-month program that pairs fledgling business teams with mentors, technology and a bit of funding. Sprint takes a small ownership stake in each.  The teams also work together, sharing knowledge and tackling shared problems. It’s true even a year later.     Pretty awesome. It's a good idea to open this up. Focusing only on Health Apps, while important, was too limiting as far as submissions. It's so great to see Sprint come roaring back under Marcelo's leadership.  I wonder how many of these products will make it to the SprintShacks!"
Sprint,38nqk1,roberts2727,2,Fri Jun 5 12:11:33 2015 UTC,"Yea, this can really be game changing for a startup that does not have access/funding to some of the latest and greatest tech. Wonder what percentage of the company we get?"

Sprint,38qcpo,sparkedman,0,Fri Jun 5 23:19:20 2015 UTC,"AC is 5GHz with a least an 80MHz channel, and no matter what 5GHz range sucks vs 2.4GHz.   If you already have decent router, and plenty of bandwidth it doesnt really matter.  Though I am sure the number of users that has one of these; a poo router, no wifi, poor bandwidth connection is very high.    But hey it is free, use it as an AP.

Calls made over Wi-Fi calling tend to drop in less than 5 minutes even if I'm less than 10 ft. from the router due to the traffic. I ordered the Wi-Fi connect router yesterday.

Often times (particularly with cable) it saves you money in modem rental fees, and the purchase of the modem often pays for itself in the first year of the modem's life.  Also, typically the combo modem/routers are just junk. The ISP not only controls the features of the modem with the firmware they push, but also limits the features of the router side of things.  Not to mention RF performance is usually abysmal because the housing must accommodate both functions."

Sprint,38m0ik,sparkedman,2,Fri Jun 5 16:43:24 2015 UTC,You can prioritize your current router... And with a connection like that you shouldn't have a huge issue unless your bandwidth is constantly hammered.  I have the AC66U and my WiFi is on RW which does VoIP. I noticed 2.4GHz is WAY better for VoIP than 5GHz. Can you try 2.4GHz? I've also done zero prioritization on and it works well. I have 1Gbps connection so there is no point.   Though I'm still going to get one myself because my AP sucks major dick. A free AC66 should do quiet nicely!
Sprint,38m0ik,skippers7,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:53:10 2015 UTC,"My router doesn't support priorization (sadly) and soesn't support 3rd party firmware like DD-WRT.

The Wi-Fi network will operate along the 2.2-mile Kansas City streetcar line through downtown. Kansas City will join Barcelona, Spain; Copenhagen, Denmark; and Hamburg, Germany as hubs for this breakthrough technology.  The Sprint Wi-Fi intelligent communications network infrastructure will enable everything from simple Wi-Fi connectivity (for Sprint customers, Kansas Citians and visitors) to smart city applications that deliver maps and information and efficiently address and manage parking, traffic, city lighting, water and waste management. Pinsight Media+, a subsidiary of Sprint, will operate the data analytics and advertising platform, bolstering the intelligent network to enable commerce and brand connections to help bring services to life.     Pretty cool! Never heard of Pinsight Media+ before.  Also, this....   In Kansas City, recent enhancements include a new wireless system at Kauffman Stadium, on-air just in time to support Royals fans on Opening Day. In April Sprint also deployed 2.5GHz spectrum at Sporting Park, home to Sporting Kansas City (MLS), providing KC soccer fans a faster data experience. And earlier this year Sprint added capacity and deployed 2.5GHz spectrum at Sprint Center in downtown Kansas City.     Off to a good start..."

Sprint,38io59,sparkedman,2,Fri Jun 5 00:09:18 2015 UTC,"This turned into a rant. I'm sorry.   Unfortunately, it doesn't seem HR has a way to identify such people. You would think someone would try to identify why someone is doing poorly on surveys. Retail can sometimes brush off bad surveys because customers can be ridiculous with their expectations. If OP gets a survey for a port request/activation and gives reps a 0, I doubt anyone will identify that the people he talked to need to be retrained. The nature of the call doesn't get reported for what it is, so the system doesn't identify the weakness. You see that an interaction occurred in iCare (or eTicket or RMS) and a description in notes, but the two don't correspond in any way, so it doesn't track to ""the customer requested a port performed in iCare, and that customer was very dissatisfied with their experience, thus we need to review this information with the employee."" And it doesn't help that offshoring has lead to a lot of calls being handled by contractors who aren't Sprint employees.   Inadequate training leads to poorly performing workers. Training/development is the weakest aspect of Sprint, and I've thought that in all of my experiences as both an employee and a customer. All introductory training is a joke, as are any subsequent modules for new policies, plans, or products. All employees in a specific position should have the same level of training, but they don't. That specifically comes out on the Care side and with technicians. Sprint's network can be the best quality in the country, but Sprint won't be the best carrier because the people aren't trained correctly.   (I had good experiences with NSS and Airave as an employee and with employee care as both an employee and a customer. Any time I've dealt with normal Care or tech support, it has been terrible. Sprint has a lot of good people, but it doesn't know how to identify them. The purge of techs in 2014 showed that. The people who know what they're doing and really care about customers aren't incentivized enough to justify performing at a higher level every day just to be paid the same as the person who always has to ask for help or who creates problems the others have to fix. Again, there's no way to measure that, so it doesn't get fixed.)"

""Sprint has developed an approved network plan in partnership with SoftBank that will allow for a cost-effective network build on an accelerated timeline,"" Sprint spokeswoman Adrienne Norton told FierceWireless.  Norton declined to comment on the status of the requests for proposals that Sprint has sent out regarding the project or how the buildout will proceed from here.  Last month at Re/code's Code Conference, Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure noted that SoftBank supports the network enhancements. ""We have a clear funding plan,"" Claure said, adding that SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son ""made a pretty strong commitment: I'm going to build a strong network.""  Sprint is embarking on a new ""Next Generation Network"" strategy to densify its network. The carrier has issued a RFP for the network work and is currently evaluating proposals from vendors. Although Claure and other Sprint executives have declined to reveal exactly how many small cells and macrocells Sprint is planning to add to its network, Claure has indicated that the carrier's long-term plan is to dramatically increase its coverage and capacity, and also to deploy Voice over LTE (VoLTE) technology. Sprint is also going to make Wi-Fi a key network element.     Hope this does the trick... ""Next Generation Network""? Why not call it ""Network Vision 3.0 or 4.0""?

I'm not entirely convinced they'll sit out, I could see them maybe going for a 5x5 block, but I doubt it.  Consider this, they just secured funding for massive densification. Low-band spectrum is not as valuable in super dense areas. If Sprint announced a massive push for native coverage in rural areas, for sure they would be gunning for 600.

Now they say they're going to densify their Spark network, which is already doing well in a handful of markets without fixing density, and people don't believe it? Why not?  If you think NV was a failure, go to rootmetrics and look at Sprint's 1H14 results for Text, Voice, and Reliability and compare them to 1H15 and 2H14.

Buying a majority stake of shares is one thing, merging the companies is entirely different.

Sprint,38gqej,sparkedman,-1,Thu Jun 4 04:03:27 2015 UTC,"See Page 5 of Neville Ray's Letter to the FCC Chairman:   However, the major shortcoming of our deployed 700 MHz spectrum is that available supply is limited. T-Mobile’s current 5+5 megahertz low-band deployment effectively caps the number of subscribers that we can serve—dramatically so in comparison to the Big Two and their dominant low band holdings. This limitation also constrains both average and peak supportable speeds at a time when these capabilities are becoming ever more important to consumers. Auction participants that are only able to acquire a 5+5 megahertz block because of an insufficient spectrum reserve will be similarly limited in their ability to serve customers and offer innovative services.  One essential element of a robust wireless network is a diversified set of spectrum holdings that incorporate at least 10+10 megahertz of low-band spectrum.11 A reserve comprised of only 30 megahertz allows only a single competitive carrier to acquire a 10+10 megahertz block without being blocked by the foreclosure tactics of the two dominant incumbents. Meanwhile, the smaller 30 megahertz reserve would allow AT&T and Verizon to split the minimum 40 megahertz of non-reserve spectrum evenly between them, which would leave each dominant provider a 10+10 megahertz block without having to directly compete against one another.12  Adopting a spectrum reserve of at least 40 megahertz will help ensure multiple carriers have an opportunity to acquire the low-band spectrum necessary to improve network reliability, extend coverage deeper inside buildings, and bring more meaningful consumer choice to rural and underserved areas throughout the United States.     I'm reading this as T-Mobile wanting a 10x10 swath of 600MHz."

Sprint,38bkdz,abcgeek,4,Wed Jun 3 03:53:01 2015 UTC,"Interesting piece. Thanks for sharing.  I noticed this on Page 4 of Neville Ray's Letter to FCC Chairman Wheeler from savewirelesschoice.com:   Indeed, the recorded signal strength is on average eight times stronger after low-band deployment than before low-band deployment.8 Post-deployment results from suburban Cleveland indicate that the signal range from a 700 MHz tower is approximately 1.8 times greater than our mid-band spectrum, which means low-band spectrum allows us to provide a coverage area three times as great as we could using higher-frequency bands, such as PCS and AWS.9      Footnote 8: Specifically, we found that 700 MHz spectrum is 9 dB stronger in areas served by both mid- and low-band spectrum, which corresponded with our previous projections. See Letter from Trey Hanbury, Counsel to T-Mobile to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC, GN Docket No. 12-268, WT Docket No. 12-269 (Apr. 1, 2014), Declaration of Mark McDiarmid at 17-18, 20 (“It would take roughly 8 cell sites using 1.9 GHz spectrum to cover the same area as one base station using 700 MHz, and at least 13 cell sites at 2.5 GHz to cover the same area as one 700 MHz tower.”  Footnote 9: This increased range is particularly important in rural markets, where lack of low-band spectrum largely prevents carriers from providing service except through costly roaming arrangements, further widening the competitive gap between the dominant carriers and all other providers. See Letter from Trey Hanbury, Counsel to T-Mobile to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC, GN Docket No. 12-268, WT Docket No. 12-269 (Apr. 23, 2015) (explaining that cost-effective network deployments in rural areas are virtually impossible without low-band spectrum).     13 sites of 2.5GHz to equal the coverage of 700MHz from one base station?... Hope Marcelo got enough funding for the site density 2.5GHz (Band 41) will require. Sprint needs a 10x10 deployment of 600MHz. Son had better be ready to open his wallet for that."
Sprint,38bkdz,sparkedman,2,Wed Jun 3 04:17:31 2015 UTC,8 B41 for 1 B25 doesn't seem correct. the 13 B41 for 1 700mhz sounds about right though. maybe if they're talking about perfect coverage.

Sprint's (NYSE: S) deployment of 8T8R (eight-branch transmit and eight-branch receive) radios coupled with 4x2 MIMO in its 2.5 GHz TDD LTE spectrum is resulting in increased data throughput as well as coverage according to a new report from Signals Research. ""Thanks to TM8 [transmission mode 8] and 8T8R, we observed meaningful increases in coverage and spectral efficiency, not to mention overall device throughput,"" Signals said in its executive summary of the report.  The firm said it extensively tested Sprint's network in the Chicago market using Band 41 (2.5 GHz) and Band 25 (1.9 GHz) in April using Accuver's drive test tools and two Galaxy Note Edge smartphones. Signals tested TM8 vs. non-TM8 performance, Band 41 and Band 25 coverage and performance as well as 8T8R receive vs. 2T2R coverage/performance and stand-alone carrier aggregation."

Sprint,38bkdz,sparkedman,4,Wed Jun 3 05:05:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah those numbers definitely don't seem to be on the up and up (at least not at face value). Low band spectrum obviously does have better range and better building penetration... but I don't see how 1.8x range with a low-band transmission correlates to the coverage of 8 mid-band sites.  The 13-1 ratio compared to the 8-1 ratio seems more likely, but the original basis of 8-1 for the B25 signal compared to 700MHz is odd. B41 can operate close to B25 with the 8T8R equipment, but that's not what's on every B41 site, so it makes sense it wouldn't be used in the example.  I'm sure the numbers do come from somewhere legitimate, but to get to that assumption it seems there were a couple leaps."

Circle A would cover 31,000 square miles, Circle B would cover 102,000 square miles. That's 3.5x the area. You would need about 4 1.9GHz towers to cover the same area as 1 700MHz tower.

Sprint,38bkdz,dsatrbs,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:45:40 2015 UTC,Ah I see now... for some reason my brain couldn't come up with that fairly simple example.
Sprint,38bkdz,halcyoncmdr,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:28:26 2015 UTC,"Why not, B41-> B25 is a 600mhz difference, B25->700mhz is 1200mhz difference. Broadcasting on 2.5ghz is closer to your home WiFi router (2.4ghz). Take a look at this. Sprint will have a network cost 10-20x more than the other carriers. That is why Marcelo went to Japan to get more money to deploy small cells. Rural coverage with 2.5 is just terrible and urban coverage will require literally every building to have a DAS."
Sprint,38bkdz,B1GEast,1 point,Wed Jun 3 11:11:38 2015 UTC,"While the frequency is similar to Home Wi-Fi (2.5 vs 2.4GHz) the power output is dramatically different.  While your home WiFi router may be able to push a signal out a couple hundred feet with a good antenna and radio combination since it is only transmitting at ~250 milliwatts. That LTE tower however will be transmitting a signal much more powerful than 250 milliwatts.  The frequency used is only one aspect of how far a signal will travel. The power output plays a huge role. Then you have the number of transmit and receive antennae that can allow a stable connection at lower signal levels (This is why the 8T8R equipment on some of the B41 towers are getting signal ranges similar to B25 at 1900MHz).  Comparing B41 to WiFi is like comparing an Orange to a Grapefruit. They might looks similar from the outside, and are related, but when you get into it they're really nothing alike."
Sprint,38bkdz,halcyoncmdr,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:35:39 2015 UTC,"I'm aware of the power output differences. The problem is that when you're trying to build a cost effective network you run into trouble trying to decide how many sites to deploy. Its not always possible to add small cells and DAS, especially in smaller towns and rural communities. Its the very same problem T-Mobile is facing. VZW/ATT have adequate low-band spectrum so they can deploy fewer towers and add mid-band spectrum in areas that need more bandwidth. Sprint and T-Mobile have to put up 3x as many macro-sites just to achieve the same coverage. Sprint's narrow PCS and 800 holdings aren't enough just like T-Mobile's 700 is barely adequate. I'm basing my experience on my town that only has 1 tower covering most of town. You can't get Band 41 beyond 100 yards of the tower where half of the population lives 4 miles from the site (800 doesn't even reach, while 700 does). For me, Band 41 may as well be super-wifi, because outside of urban environments with many macro-sites it doesn't reach far in suburban and rural communities."

Sprint,388gpa,t0rn4d0r3x,2,Tue Jun 2 23:41:31 2015 UTC,It looks like this is all exclusive to best buy too..  I think it's weird that they're catering to pre-paid.
Sprint,388gur,sparkedman,2,Tue Jun 2 16:24:33 2015 UTC,"From Article:   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (BUSINESS WIRE), June 02, 2015 - Calling all sports enthusiasts – never miss a game with today’s launch of boostTV and a $10 boostTV™ Live Sports add-on, a video streaming service that lets customers watch live and on-demand sports content, including the upcoming Copa America, exclusively on BeIN SPORTS on a Boost Mobile smartphone.  In line with other monthly plan add-ons, customers can add the boostTV Live Sports add-on for $10 per month.

Existing customers can add the monthly subscription online via My Account (web and smartphone), in store, or by phone. Customers who have already installed the free boostTV™ app on their phone can subscribe to the boostTV Live Sports add-on within the app.   ....   Currently, the new sports package comes with the following channels:    AyM Sports Azteca America BeIN Sports BeIN Sports en Español Fightbox Latin American Sports TyC   boostTV gives access to all the following major sports content and events:  Live soccer   Latin America: 2015 Copa America (South America), Primera Division and Copa Argentina (Argentina) and Copa de Brasil (Brazil) Mexico: Liga MX, Copa MX, Ascenso MX Europe: La Liga and Copa del Rey (Spain), Serie A and Coppa Italia (Italy), Ligue 1, Coupe de France and Coupe de la Ligue (France)     Neat! Sprint says it's the: ""First live TV service offered by a prepaid wireless carrier.""  We all know Marcelo is a big soccer fan! :-)  From Wikipedia:   In 2008, Claure bought BAISA (Bolivar Administración, Inversiones y Servicios Asociados, S.R.L.), the entity that operates Bolivar, a football (soccer) team in Bolivia.[14] He also serves on FIFA’s (Fédération Internationale de Football Association’s) Committee for Fair Play and Social Responsibility.     He's also working with David Beckham to build a stadium in Miami and bring a new MLS Expansion Team.  EDITED TO ADD:   Starting today, Sprint customers can also access the Sprint TV Live Sports package – with all the same content as boostTV Live Sports – using the Sprint TV & Movies app for $9.99/month. Available for most Android and iOS devices from Sprint, customers can download the app through Google Play or the Apple App Store. In addition to this new sports package, the Sprint TV app offers free and premium content, including live and on-demand, with access to hundreds of popular primetime shows, news and kids programming. Both services are being powered by MobiTV’s cutting-edge, multi-screen managed services platform.   It lives! I thought Sprint had forgotten all about Sprint TV!"
Sprint,388gur,B1GEast,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:33:54 2015 UTC,Does Boost offer data add-ons? Video uses a lot of data.
Sprint,387nsi,MrNagant,3,Tue Jun 2 13:02:27 2015 UTC,"No idea how it happened, but that's great a Sprint DAS got installed. What bands does the Sprint DAS support?"
Sprint,387nsi,sparkedman,3,Tue Jun 2 13:19:39 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to get a picture of the boxes the APs came in to find all supported frequencies. The only label attached that I can see on the units is the one added that says VZW or Sprint and an ID number.  From what I can tell it is just the PCS spectrum. B25 and then 3G/1xRTT.   I pull in a constant 12Mbps. The VZW I think is just 700MHz that I know of so far. Don't know anyone with ATT/TMo yet.   I find DAS systems to be weird so far in my experience. My last employer I had no clue what they installed but VZW was 3G, Sprinted roamed on Cricket 3G, ATT was HSPA, and TMo was nothing. Maybe they installed just a Cellular A/B DAS?"
Sprint,387nsi,lilotimz,3,Tue Jun 2 13:38:31 2015 UTC,DAS setups are enterprise level installations that are negotiated between companies.  They're typically funded from both sprint and the company that owns the space that they're installing it in.   They don't randomly install it for no reason as it costs tens to hundreds of thousands and even millions of dollars depending on how big of a setup it is.
Sprint,387nsi,roberts2727,2,Tue Jun 2 16:18:19 2015 UTC,Is your employer a national chain? Maybe they use Sprint at one of the other branches/headquarters and want to ensure the C levels have good service when they travel to your location.

Sprint,389zhp,Photojared,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:08:58 2015 UTC,So does that mean picture mail = a text msg to somewhere else with a picture?  Or could it be a an email?
Sprint,389zhp,Photojared,2,Tue Jun 2 22:13:14 2015 UTC,Picture mail is a MMS message (text message).
Sprint,389zhp,Jamdawg,2,Tue Jun 2 23:06:25 2015 UTC,"MMS is not a text message. SMS is a text message  sms travels over the voice network, and MMS travels through the data network."
Sprint,389zhp,Photojared,3,Wed Jun 3 00:55:50 2015 UTC,"Yes I know, but for the layman it's a text message (sent via data)."
Sprint,389zhp,Jamdawg,2,Wed Jun 3 01:24:59 2015 UTC,"mms is not the same an an email, they are 2 different protocols.  both travel over data, but are transmitted differently.  MMS uses up your monthly data bucket.  fyi if you send a picture to another iphone or ios device, it goes through imessage and does NOT get tracked on sprints network so it does not use up your data bucket"
Sprint,389zhp,Photojared,2,Wed Jun 3 00:57:29 2015 UTC,You have that backwards guy.  iMessage uses data - MMS does not.

Sprint,387gvv,ajac09,2,Wed Jun 3 13:53:07 2015 UTC,Check coverage in your area using signal or something. Sprint aims high but usually hits the bare minimum.
Sprint,387gvv,ajac09,2,Tue Jun 2 13:17:27 2015 UTC,"On the coverage map it says I'm covered for 4g, that's true right? Would it be spotty at all?"

Sprint,387gvv,notoneoriginalidea,3,Tue Jun 2 13:36:50 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks! I checked and it looks like I have pretty good coverage in my area :)"
Sprint,387gvv,sparkedman,2,Tue Jun 2 13:42:13 2015 UTC,Awesome! at least these maps show realistic coverage vs what the carrier says.
Sprint,387gvv,sparkedman,2,Tue Jun 2 13:48:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thanks so much! The Sprint coverage is actually about the same as AT&T so that's fantastic!"
Sprint,387gvv,sparkedman,3,Tue Jun 2 13:55:22 2015 UTC,I personally love Sprint. I will disclose that i live in Minnesota and have no knowledge of their coverage in Michigan. I'm more curious as to why you are switching from android to iphone?
Sprint,387gvv,sparkedman,2,Tue Jun 2 12:27:44 2015 UTC,"I'm switching because I'm from Canada, and everyone I know has iMessage so it would be a million times easier to talk to them! Plus the great deal on sprint!"
Sprint,387gvv,sparkedman,3,Tue Jun 2 12:39:55 2015 UTC,"I'm a very satisfied Sprint Customer too. The iPhone 6 plan is a great deal. The network has improved tremendously, and it will continue to do so. Should you happen to run into any coverage issues at home/work, which can happen with any carrier, on Sprint you can use Wi-Fi Calling, which AT&T doesn't offer. See: here  Are you planning to do a Lease or Easy Pay?  EDITED: more questions for OP..."

Sprint,387gvv,blaziecat1103,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:54:11 2015 UTC,"Lease and Easy Pay each have their advantages.  The chart explains what each option means as far as payments/device ownership, etc.  Be sure to read the Sprint Lease FAQ's. Very important info in there.  Leasing offers the lowest out of pocket cost over 2 years. (12 month leases are also available). You have the option to purchase your leased device at the end of your lease. Otherwise, you have to turn it in.  Easy Pay is if you want to own the device at the end of 2 years. (Or sooner if you pay it off)"
Sprint,3881sk,KurioHonoo,2,Tue Jun 2 14:49:30 2015 UTC,Could be a farther tower. It's also possible that Band 26 is in the process of being optimized and hasn't been turned up all the way yet.  Good to see that you're getting coverage in the middle of nowhere though... Where are you?
Sprint,3881sk,sparkedman,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:23:00 2015 UTC,I'm mean it's not technically in the middle of nowhere. I just say it is. I live in WI between Stoughton and Cottage grove. I think the only reason I have LTE is because it's right off an exit for the interstate.
Sprint,3881sk,pwastage,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:47:21 2015 UTC,Could be sprint using a lower power for b26 to avoid interference with another cell?
Sprint,3881sk,pwastage,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:21:00 2015 UTC,Maybe.. Does any other carrier use B26? I know Verizon and US Cellular use B5 which is 850mhz compared to B26s 800

They will focus their initial deployments at specific urban dead zones and high capacity areas (downtown mainstreets, business areas, malls, arenas etc) desparately need it the most as that is what small cells are made for.   If you are talking about actual LTE coverage in home like a LTE femto cell then no. Best you can do is a LTE booster from a third party like weBoost (formerly wilson electronics) or get an Airave or Wifi Connect router (Asus AC66). No carrier guarantees coverage indoors due to conditions the carriers cannot plan for like building materials or natural foilage that is not nice to RF signals."

Band 26 might be what you need to get LTE inside.  Download Signal Check and see if you get 1x800 or B26 at all.

Sprint,3858sh,sparkedman,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:26:02 2015 UTC,"What zip code?  I wouldn't bother with a signal booster, they cost as much as buying a phone ($300-400 for Wilson's and they have to be roof/tower mounted for optimal experience). If you need voice service, I'd get a phone with WiFi calling (or ask for a Sprint Airave 2.5). If you want data service, I'd look for another wireless provider. You're already paying good money for service, you shouldn't have to invest in expensive equipment just to get what you're already paying for."

Sprint,383enz,Yak00,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:26:49 2015 UTC,How is it an annual upgrade. They don't give you a discount. Just the honor of an installment plan at full price.
Sprint,383enz,sparkedman,2,Mon Jun 1 16:40:44 2015 UTC,Because you don't have to pay off the whole device. You can trade it in after 12 monthly payments for a new device and start a new installment plan.  What discount are you expecting here?
Sprint,383enz,Yak00,-2,Mon Jun 1 16:44:04 2015 UTC,lol that is stupid. No wonder people are broke. You come out way ahead if you pay the device off then sell it then give it back to sprint and get nothing.
Sprint,383enz,3WordPosts,2,Mon Jun 1 17:05:05 2015 UTC,on certain phones you are correct. Yes you might be able to sell an iphone 6 for $375 in a year. But are you going to be able to sell an iphone 5c for $220? or a 5s for $275?  How about a galaxy s5 for $276 next year?  I doubt it.
Sprint,383enz,Yak00,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:17:29 2015 UTC,If you know how to buy phones you will usually get back about 50% of the value within a year. Up to 2 years with iphones..  I can't help the general population buys something for 600 that is worth 300 dollars 6 months later. They should do more research?  Oh but I suppose if they did they wouldn't pay into a phone only to give it back to sprint. That is who these installment plans are aimed at.
Sprint,383enz,sparkedman,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:39:52 2015 UTC,Not everybody can come up with $199 (16 GB)/$299 (64GB)/$399 (128 GB) as a lump sum for a 2 year contract. Zero interest installments have their purpose.
Sprint,383enz,Yak00,-1,Mon Jun 1 19:52:51 2015 UTC,So instead of paying 199.99 for something they pay 600 dollars for it. Does not sound very smart. But I suppose these things are aimed at people who can't manage money.
Sprint,383enz,sparkedman,3,Mon Jun 1 20:45:34 2015 UTC,"Framily is for Installment Payments. That's the whole point.  If you want a 2 year contract, have at it here:   Sprint iPhones are available with a 2-year contract via the Apple Store (Online/Retail).  See: Plan Pricing and Hotspot Pricing   That is ""Unlimited My Way"" and ""My All-In"".     2 Year Contract: iPhone 6 (16 GB): out of pocket over 2 years: ($80/month x 24) + $199 = $2,119 Framily: iPhone 6 (16 GB): out of pocket over 2 years: ($45/month x 24) + (~$27/month x 24) = $1,728   Now remember, you can also upgrade annually on Framily... So you just turn in your phone at 12 months and start on a new installment.  So which one costs more? I'll wait..."
Sprint,383enz,Yak00,-1,Mon Jun 1 21:14:53 2015 UTC,I remember when I could upgrade every year on a contract and keep the phone with sprint..  Those were the days.

Sprint,383enz,Yak00,0,Mon Jun 1 21:49:58 2015 UTC,Tired of seeing people guided towards these plans when they are the worst thing they could do with their money.  The phasing out of 2 year contract plans with phone discounts has prob been the worst thing for people.
Sprint,382wgp,gomfam,5,Mon Jun 1 13:43:24 2015 UTC,You will get an S4.

See: Plan Pricing and Hotspot Pricing  --> ""Unlimited My Way"" and ""My All-In"" live on!  This whole setup strikes me as odd.    EDIT: Sprint Lease and Easy Pay are available in-store only...

Sprint,382myv,sparkedman,2,Mon Jun 1 12:21:39 2015 UTC,"From Article:   That said, each of the four NBA arenas tested presented its own respective findings based on their current connectivity level.  For the AmericanAirlines Arena, they attended the game when the Miami Heat hosted the Oklahoma City Thunder this season. This 19,600 capacity facility recently upgraded to a multi-million DAS installation prior to this testing, featuring over 320 strategically-placed antennas but no Wi-Fi. There were 19,735 fans in attendance that date; and Verizon scored the best among the carriers with a 98.4 in RootMetrics’ data performance scale of 0-100. The other three carriers, T-Mobile, AT&T, and Sprint, finished as such, respectively: 89.5, 84.2, 65.4. In terms of reliability, every carrier scored above 94, with the exception of Sprint and its 67.6. As for speed, there was greater discrepancies across the board, where AT&T and Sprint were in the 60s, T-Mobile close to 77.0, and Verizon at 96.0.  Most notably for median upload speeds–there’s variations in speed to keep in mind, with max speed not really being that impactful to do tasks in this setting–Verizon reached 12.0 Mbps (Megabits per second) that would allow a fan to e-mail a photo from this event in less than three seconds; whereas for Sprint, its 1.0 Mbps would take 25 seconds for a fan to e-mail a photo.   .....   The BMO Harris Bradley Center–definitely one of the oldest arenas in the NBA and likely to soon be replaced for new venue–had different results when RootMetrics tested during the Milwaukee Bucks’ home game versus the Sacramento Kings. In its nearly three-decade-old existence, there hasn’t been Wi-Fi added lately to their DAS. Of the 13,406 fans within the 18,717 capacity in attendance that night, it was Verizon users that had the best level of reception. Verizon led carriers in RootMetrics’ testing with 95.9, AT&T with 83.6, Sprint with 81.1, and T-Mobile with 68.6. With regards to reliability, there were better marks across the board, with Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile finishing in this order, respectively: 100.0, 96.4, 92.9, 79.5. In speed, though, the larger disparities emerged; Verizon was slightly below a 90.0, AT&T and Sprint logged in the 60.0s, and T-Mobile barely over 50.0.  The median upload speed highlighted the speed deficiency even more; Verizon’s 5.8 Mbps would take less than five seconds to e-mail a photo while T-Mobile’s 0.4 Mbps reaches a minute to do the same task.   .....   As for the United Center, RootMetrics ran testing when the Chicago Bulls hosted the Orlando Magic. The Bulls have upgraded their in-venue mobile reception recently thanks to AT&T, where DAS and Wi-Fi coexist, including 400 antennas of the latter. In a game that had 21,302 fans on hand within the 20,917 seating capacity, Verizon continued its high marks based on RootMetrics’ study. Verizon, Sprint, AT&T, and T-Mobile scored in this order, respectively, as follows: 95.5, 76.6, 67.2, 61.0. In terms of reliability, Verizon netted a perfect 100.0; AT&T’s 67.7 proved some issues connecting to the network across the tested facets, but managed to complete data tasks; and T-Mobile’s 66.6 stood out for its strong connection rates while experiencing network problems to finish data tasks. The data speed for these carriers were Verizon’s 88.7, AT&T’s 66.6, Sprint’s 61.1, and T-Mobile’s 52.6.  Specifically for the media upload speed, both of Verizon’s download and upload speeds (8.7 and 9.2 Mbps, respectively) were not drastically faster than the rest of the carrier, although they were much faster than speeds found on Wi-Fi; its upload speed meant e-mailing a photo takes four seconds compared to T-Mobile’s one minute.   .....   Lastly, Staples Center, RootMetrics performed its testing during a Los Angeles Lakers game versus the Chicago Bulls. DAS and Wi-Fi have been installed by Verizon to this 15 year-old venue. 18,997 fans of the 19,060 capacity who have Verizon received the best mobile reception, albeit not as well as the other NBA arenas from this testing. The overall results were 69.9, 60.4, 48.5, and 37.2 for Verizon, Sprint, AT&T, and T-Mobile, respectively. Verizon’s 67.3 score in reliability meant it has solid connection rates of data transfers, lacking ability to finish tasks after connection was established, especially in upload testing. T-Mobile’s meager 35.7 in reliability shows the other end of the spectrum, troubles on the two main areas; Sprint’s 58.1 and AT&T’s 48.2 were in between. Speed testing was subpar for all of these carriers, under 74.0 each.  With Staples Center’s Wi-Fi producing different median download and upload speeds (5.6 and 11.1 Mbps, respectively), Verizon median download speed proved to be almost twice as fast as the speed recorded on Wi-Fi, yet its median upload speed of 1.5 Mbps was significantly slower than that found on Wi-Fi; the former allows a fan to download a song in less than five seconds with Verizon, whereas T-Mobile’s 0.2 takes four minutes for such an activity.     Better get on this Marcelo... No reason Sprint should be so far off the mark.  I'm glad RootMetrics is testing venues."
Sprint,382myv,MrNagant,1 point,Mon Jun 1 12:23:41 2015 UTC,Seems like Sprint could just put a B41 antenna on the ceiling and call it good.   What I'd like Root to do is map LTE bases on the frequency. Different color for each frequency. This way we can watch everyone's buildouts in near real time.
Sprint,37z5u7,Diabloceratops,4,Sun May 31 17:15:34 2015 UTC,"It's not a bad deal assuming you actually don't use more than 1GB and/or you have a corporate discount (discount applied to the data portion ($20)).  There is a $50 unlimited talk/text/data plan but no discounts apply to that.  I'd personally pay the extra $5 for the piece of mind and not being tied to wifi all day, but that's just me.  Leasing isn't a bad option if you don't mind not owning the phone, which most people don't care about anymore since they just give it back to the company anyway.    Insurance is iffy.  If you aren't worried about it being lost or stolen, I'd personally remove it because Apple will replaced damaged screens in store for ~$109 with no Apple Care* vs $200 insurance deductible + all your monthly insurance payments. Even if the phone is beat to hell, the penalty at the end is $200, the same cost as a deductible without making the $11/mo.    Honestly, I'd believe Apple Care is the better option for coverage, especially if you're within driving distance of an Apple store. It doesn't cover lost or stolen, but the trade off of cheaper deductible and, in my opinion, better quality replacements is worth it.  Plus, you have up to a year to purchase it.  *If your phone screen is smash because it's bent in half, Apple won't replace it.  Has to just be the screen the cracked, not full body damage."
Sprint,37z5u7,FiddlingCactus,1 point,Sun May 31 21:22:43 2015 UTC,"The only time I went over 1GB was when I changed the wifi password at home and forgot to put it in my phone. But usually, I'm not even close to 1GB. I get an 18% discount as well.  If I drop the insurance and switch to Applecare it would be cheaper overall, too. I'd have to wait for the end of next month for my next paycheck (unless I use my credit card or some of my savings). And there is an Apple store about 15min away.  I might do that. I just don't want to do the wrong thing!"
Sprint,37z5u7,FiddlingCactus,3,Sun May 31 22:14:53 2015 UTC,"In that case, I'd just stay with the 1GB plan since your discounts is a factor.    You have up to one year from the time of purchase to get Apple Care, so there's no real rush unless you're worried about damage.  You can even get it cheaper than buying from Apple if you look around on eBay.  The only better plan you could get would be jumping on a Framily plan with 7+ lines attached to an id.  Since you're okay with 1GB, a mostly full/full id would be $25 for unlimited talk/text/1GB + lease payment.  Check out /r/SprintFramily if you're interested in that.  Easy way to join a good id since the main Framily holder will do the work to keep it full."

Sprint,37z5u7,B1GEast,2,Thu Jun 4 01:09:07 2015 UTC,"On the 1GB plan, your 18% discount applies to the $20 data allowance - so you are paying $41.20 for the service, $20 for the lease, and $11 for insurance. $72.20, plus $3-4 for government taxes and carrier surcharges, depending on where you live. You'll pay roughly $75 a month - right where you were before.  I would say that that is a good deal to get a new phone without any up-front cost."
Sprint,37z5u7,sparkedman,4,Mon Jun 1 00:46:53 2015 UTC,"You should have unlimited at that price, which is $50 (plus lease). Best Buy offers the same plan for $65 total. Although in my opinion leasing is a terrible option."

Sprint,37z5u7,B1GEast,1 point,Sun May 31 22:47:28 2015 UTC,"Can you explain why leasing is terrible? That's my gut reaction, but I don't have good reason."
Sprint,37z5u7,jonlucc,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:35:47 2015 UTC,"A number of different reasons mostly similar to the buy vs rent for housing.   The biggest one for me is that you have to return the device in good condition or pay full price (at their discretion). That means you may have to purchase all sorts of protective gear and insurance ($$) all while carefully handling it every time you take it out of your pocket. I never buy insurance and I don't like using bulky cases and screen protection. These alone can raise your price by $150-200.  There isn't much savings to a lease (at least long-term). You save money up-front because zero-down and lower monthly pricing, but you end the lease with no collateral (you give the phone back). In most cases you can sell your device for more than the cost difference between a lease and full retail (~$200). You can see the pricing over at Swappa, an iPhone 6 is hovering around the same price as a 24 month lease (but you own it).   You have few options if you're victim of buyer's remorse. If you decide that you don't like the phone, you have to buy out the lease and sell the phone. Phones depreciate in pricing very quickly. Right now you can get a refurb iPhone from Walmart for the same price as a lease (but you can keep it or sell it).  The lease assumes you want the next iPhone or Galaxy phone. What if you decide that you want a Windows Phone, LG, or HTC next? You're forced to use devices that Sprint tells you to use (and pay more since Android leases are more expensive). You're also beholden to the product release cycle. If you do decide to get the next iPhone, you have to wait for it to be released.   It's not a very good deal if you're a value-seeker or price conscious. The availability of many affordable mid-range devices makes is silly to spend upwards of $500 on a phone these days. You can pick up a LG G2, which is more phone that most people need, for around $200 new."

Sprint,37z5u7,sparkedman,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:17:39 2015 UTC,"Funny thing is that Walmart has the Sprint iPhone Refurb for $425 which is less than the $480 you'd pay for a lease (and you pay tax on the full retail cost of $649). Plus, you could sell the phone and get at least $200 back, making the net cost only $225."

Since you're in contract, I'm guessing you're on an unlimited data plan so you won't have to worry about the additional data usage when not on Wifi. They've started making flash drives that plug directly into the iPhone, which you can use for external file storage (can hold pictures/music/videos but not apps).  This looks just like the Mophie case you're interested in, but in a standalone product rather than a case.

Sprint,37vbrk,sparkedman,1 point,Sat May 30 18:37:21 2015 UTC,"Sure thing.  Lease is for if you want to trade in your device every 12/24 months and not own it. It offers the lowest out of pocket cost. You still have the option to buy your device at the end of of your lease period.  Easy Pay is if you want to own your device at the end of 24 months. (Or sooner if you pay it off.)  The Unlimited Plus Plan is a special plan for the S6: $80/month, which includes the cost of the device and annual device upgrades. You are effectively leasing the phone for 24 months, but trading it in at 12 months for a new device.  How to:  Purchase Pick your device and choose a 24-month lease option.  Monthly credit Receive a $20 per month credit for choosing the 24-month lease option, making your monthly phone payment as low as $0.  Annual upgrade After a year's worth of lease payments, you can upgrade to the latest phone, and give back your current phone.    Sound good?"
Sprint,37vbrk,awesomeman91,1 point,Sat May 30 18:55:20 2015 UTC,Im in the same boat as op. Same 450 plan and all but just with an s4 instead. Any of those include the 64g versions? They only show the 32g with the plans. Also i pay now $92 a month for my current plan. The taxes and stuff add up to $12 total. If i get the $80 plan am i looking at the same $92 a month bill?
Sprint,37vbrk,sparkedman,2,Sat May 30 23:53:57 2015 UTC,"It's $80/month for the 32GB version included.  The 64GB version is available, but you pay a bit more as a total plan cost.  See the FAQ on the page.   Does a 64 or 128 GB device receive a higher credit? No, all models of Galaxy S 6 or S 6 edge receive the same $20 per month credit when you choose the 24-month lease option."
Sprint,37vbrk,awesomeman91,2,Sun May 31 01:27:45 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for the help. I'llbe visiting a store soon to ask as many questions possible.
Sprint,37vbrk,sparkedman,1 point,Sun May 31 01:34:55 2015 UTC,Sure thing!
Sprint,37vbrk,Koshka69,1 point,Sun May 31 16:38:49 2015 UTC,the s6 in 32 gb with credit class A is 20$  the 64 gb is 25. So basically just add an additional 5 $
Sprint,37vbrk,awesomeman91,1 point,Sun May 31 00:07:52 2015 UTC,Thanks! So my monthly bill would be roughly $100? Just trying to figure it out cause i havent kept up with all these terms and its confusing. Last time i check plans was when i moved from tmobile to sprint back in 2011 for the s2. Now its 2015 and i have an upgrade and a dying phone and i dont have an idea as to how leasing or easy pay or whatever else they wanna throw at us works.
Sprint,37vbrk,Koshka69,2,Sun May 31 00:36:47 2015 UTC,"ok let me go into a little detail, they have two plans   50$ - for iphone 6 and 6 plus only   60$ - for any other phone even an iphone below an iphone 6  Both plans are exactly the same but i guess they knew since the iphone is so popular they would make it a better offer. But both are exactly the same unlimited everything.   Then comes the price of the phone. Now ZERO DOWN applies to credit A customers. So first you would have to establish what class u are in.  This you can find out by calling or going in store. But ill break down both scenarios for u. lets say were talking about the iphone (Just an example). Someone with credit class A would pay 0 down and 20 a month for the phone. Someone with credit class B would pay a certain amount down in the case of the iphone the down would be 170$. Now this 170 is not a deposit its simply more down for the phone upfront. Now since you pay down 170$ means you have less left to pay off. So your $20 payment would go down to roughly thirteen and some change. Taxes are about ten bux. So in case of the galaxy it would be the same exact concept except the plan is 60 plus whatever your approval rate is for the phone so either 20 or 25 dollars depending what size you want and zero down or again around 180 + down and much less for the phone monthly . So lets pretend you are credit class A 60 for the plan + 25 for the phone +10 taxes= 95 (insurance is 13 optional but i would highly recommended since youre leasing. So if you are credit class B or less you would pay more up front but your monthly would be much less but overall same money out of your pocket at some point or other .  Now what does leasing mean exactly when it comes to phones ? Well unlike T-mobile Sprint wont charge you any financing or APR so youre not paying them to lease you're simply paying $200 less than the phone costs. So if a phone is around $700 at the end of your two year term you would have payed off $500 so you will have two options, since $200 is unpaid you return the phone and start a new lease OR pay off the 200 keep the phone and your bill will drop to just 60 plus tax since you no longer have to make payments. But why would someone want to pay the FULL price on a phone thats crazy ! Well because although you are paying full or close to full price for a phone you are paying less for the plan so your two year cost out of pocket is less. Quick example: a customer on a old two year plan pays 69.99 for the plan 10 for data and ten for taxes thats a total of 90 bucks . 90 bucks x 24 months is 2,160 plus a standard 199 plus tax for a phone. youre total cost for everything in two years would be 2,420.  Lease price for a galaxy is 60 for the plan 20 for the phone and ten taxes 90 bucks same for the 24 months 2,160 so if you take advantage of the lease you wont loose any money. And even if you pay off the phone you still come out about 60 dollars the winner and you will pay about 35 less monthly for as long as you keep you phone that you payed off. If you take advantage of the lease every year well great youve just saved yourself roughly 200 every two years. If you end up going for the iphone you would save yourself even more money. Now these are very common examples as far as the comparison to the old plans but they are just that examples. Some people have corporate discounts on their legacy plans and that actually ends up saving them more money so you really have to go in store and speak to a rep. But i hope now you have a better idea of how it works ! Good luck !   excuse my spelling and grammar im on mobile"
Sprint,37vbrk,awesomeman91,1 point,Sun May 31 09:12:45 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for the break down. Im actually a credit A customer and also have a 18% discount on my bill.  Leasing sounds like a good option. With leasing can i put money down anyways to hurry up the process of paying the phone off or no? Thanks again for that breakdown!
Sprint,37vbrk,Koshka69,2,Sun May 31 16:43:14 2015 UTC,Exactly! just pay whatever you want upfront and you'll have less to pay off ! But when you go in store ask if you are eligible for the loyalty lease credit. This is where you dont have to change your plan at all (for now) and instead they will credit you 15 every month off the $20 lease price. ends up being a bout the same price and you dint have to lose your employee discount. so basically your current bill just goes up about 7 bucks. I would recommend that for now since you're getting some savings with your employee discount.    (the 50 and 60 dollar plans are not eligible for discounts so you would loose yours if you switched)

Sprint,37ubgp,flloyd,1 point,Sat May 30 17:34:22 2015 UTC,"Check out how much it would be to buy out your contract.  Get a phone that doesn't require a data plan, smallest amount of talk and text, find out how many months u have left...compare the two and see where ur at.  Probably easier and less hectic to just buy it out but check as it may raise your fathers bill to cut a line depending on how many lines he has and if it's part of a family plan."
Sprint,37ubgp,flloyd,2,Sat May 30 13:39:14 2015 UTC,"Problem is I'm not on a contract, I'm on easy pay. I won't be able to afford buying out right away after getting my own service.   I've had some major family drama happen recently and long story short I can't stay on his plan for very much longer. Plus the service around here is God awful. I'm lucky to get three bars in the middle of the city (Des Moines, so not some small town).   So I just need a temporary solution to reduce the cost of my phone on his plan until I can pay the line off and port out the number to my new service."
Sprint,37q8yl,sparkedman,10,Fri May 29 15:18:29 2015 UTC,I just hope that they put enough money into it were these companies that win the bids prefer to put Sprint tickets in a higher priority.   I'd love to see a rapid network expansion. I hate all the 1x I run into.
Sprint,37q8yl,MrNagant,3,Fri May 29 17:54:58 2015 UTC,"This is an agressive plan and I can say that the deployment urgency after Hess and with Claure was noticeable.  Rather than another round of stringing us users along for the network we've been waiting for, I get the feeling it'll actually happen in a decent time frame this time."
Sprint,37q8yl,ViceroyFizzlebottom,2,Fri May 29 20:34:19 2015 UTC,"I see it more that the deployment under Hesse was where the underlying tech upgrades happened, where the most disruption would occur and where the least noticeable upgrades (1xAdvanced for instance) happened.  Once that underlying tech was in place then the LTE, 800Mhz, and Spark overlays could start. Some areas were faster than others obviously in this regard.  I think a lot of it simply had to with the first phase not having much customer-facing benefit yet it was required for that second phase that people notice, and Hesse became a scapegoat for it essentially."

Sprint,37q8yl,Photojared,2,Sun May 31 02:51:28 2015 UTC,"Sort of the opposite of Gary Forsee. He's ultimately the one responsible for the Sprint network becoming so outdated (years of zero CAPEX at the start of the smartphone revolution caused that). However most people don't remember him and that legacy.  Forsee was named one of the ""Best Managers"" of 2004 by Business Week magazine for the percieved merger with Nextel... then was ousted in 2007 (with an overly generous severance package he definitely shouldn't have gotten). He has since been listed amongst the Worst CEOS both in wireless and of all time by several organizations including Fierce Wireless, Business Insider, and CBS News.  Sprint had one of the (if not the) strongest 3G networks at the time, and only had to hold onto that position and move forwards from there. They already had plans for utilizing the 2.5GHz spectrum originally owned by Nextel, etc. yet Forsee decided that since the network was working great, they didn't need to expand or improve anymore (apparently). Then the iPhone launched in 2007 and sparked a revolution in the industry towards data-centric smartphones and a start heading away from the classic voice and SMS networks. Combining the start of a data-centric consumer shift with a lack of CAPEX spending and you end up with the Sprint Network circa 2009."

Sprint,37q8yl,alohawolf,6,Wed Jun 3 16:34:53 2015 UTC,"Some exciting news from this article:   Sources said Sprint is close to an announcement on the next phase of its network upgrades, and that the carrier will soon name approved contractors for each of roughly 100 markets. Sprint is said to have asked dozens of companies to submit bids, and is expected to narrow the list down to a handful of approved providers. Each chosen company is expected to be approved for specific markets.   ....   One individual who works with several of Sprint’s contractors expects the carrier to add 6,000 new macro sites, including new tower builds and co-locations on other carriers’ towers. In addition to new site builds, Sprint is expected to add capacity to thousands of its existing towers.   Two models for build-to-suit       Sprint is said to have asked potential contractors to bid for new site builds based on two possible models. Contractors were reportedly asked to submit bids based on their expected costs if they identify and secure the cell sites themselves, and also to submit based on their expected costs if Sprint handles site acquisition.  The first model is usually preferable to tower companies. If they handle site acquisition they can negotiate rents and escalators up front in order to control costs going forward.  If Sprint chooses the second model, the carrier could secure new cell sites itself or through a third party. In either case it would bring building permits to the tower companies, and the tower companies would move forward with construction.   Vendors and contractors       Ericsson, Alcatel-Lucent and Samsung have been Sprint’s LTE vendors in the past, and the carrier is expected to work with all of these companies this time around. Nokia, which is buying Alcatel-Lucent, is also expected to be a vendor in some capacity. One source said that the equipment vendors will be asked to bid the services work as well, and that if they pass on it Sprint will move on to the traditional infrastructure services providers.  MasTec, Black & Veatch, Goodman Networks, BlueStream Professional Services and Nexius are all infrastructure services providers that are likely to be part of Sprint’s network upgrade. Even if Sprint taps the equipment vendors for services work, those vendors are likely to subcontract to infrastructure services providers.   Small cells       Sprint is also expected to add thousands of small cells to its network over the next several years. The 2.5 GHz spectrum that Sprint acquired from Clearwire is well suited for high-density deployments. One source expects Sprint to deploy 100,000 small cells, and said that Samsung, Nokia and Airspan are likely to be vendors.  Sprint’s majority owner is Japan’s Softbank, which has already built an extensive small cell network in its home country. Softbank has deployed small cells in both urban and rural parts of Japan. Earlier this month, Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure said he was traveling to Japan to discuss network plans with Softbank executives."

Not sure that they'll do much in this area since it's mostly ruralburban, but this is good news for places like Nashville that really do need some capacity upgrades and new cell sites.  One thing I'd really like to see is for CDMA2000 to go away.  I know it's wishful thinking to expect that anytime in the next couple years, but my phone likes to throw away a decent weak LTE signal for a strong 3G signal, even though the LTE was faster.  If they were quick to roll out VoLTE, they could look to refarm the spectrum currently occupied by 1X / EVDO for better LTE coverage.  The only congestion I've run into lately is on b26 - maybe getting that extra 800MHz spectrum currently used for 1X could alleviate that."
Sprint,37q8yl,MrNagant,1 point,Fri May 29 22:02:04 2015 UTC,"1x800 is only a small 1.25MHz block. That isn't going to do much for LTE and reduce their talk coverage.   It does help take the load off 1x1900 so could potentially be refarmed. What is interesting though I'd were they can easily refarm and add more 1900LTE, they aren't. I'd figure they'd do that so they can focus B41 more heavily in other places.  Sprint could do two 10x10 1900LTE in my market and still have 10x10 for 1x/3G. Instead they are deploying B41. Its great, but an additional 15MHz on PCS would be great too."

I'd rather have better b25 with a weaker signal than crappy b26, personally.  It seems to be working out well in the Vegas market where there is no b26."
Sprint,37q8yl,tsumeone,1 point,Fri May 29 22:27:57 2015 UTC,Find some more eSMR 800 mhz spectrum for Sprint then.   I'm sure public safety agencies would love to totally move out of the lower eSMR 800mhz public safety reserved spectrum for Sprint after they've been directed to move there by the FCC / Sprint over the past 10+ years which is really beyond the point as then they'll need to utilize Band 27 and replace out all their existing 800 mhz equipment.

Sprint,37q8yl,halcyoncmdr,0,Sat May 30 01:31:49 2015 UTC,"One thing I did not see in the article was improving their logic to kick phones off of bands when a ""Better"" band is available.

I also did not see the article mention re-farming spectrum for PCS, which they absolutely need to do because there is no way in hell they are going to put up 100,000 small cells within a year."
Sprint,37q8yl,tsumeone,1 point,Sat May 30 01:54:53 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if that logic is actually active yet since a lot of the network doesn't even have a majority of two LTE bands broadcasting yet.

Sprint does not throttle like AT&T or T-Mobile. They do use network prioritization though. You must meet all of these requirements to be prioritized lower.   You must be in the top percentage of users (we don't know what area though, like if it is by tower groupings, market, or nationwide). The tower you are on must currently be congested. Your data will be prioritized lower than other traffic, the data packets will be allowed through at full speed but might have to wait for other packets for a short time before being allowed through. The end result is similar but the actual real world scenario  can result in high speeds even while congested. Once that tower is no longer congested the effects of your network prioritization go away."

Sprint supported Google Wallet from day one, going so far as to offer a $50 Google Wallet credit. Verizon blocked it for ISIS because of a so-called ""secure element"" issue or some other bs. ISIS became SoftCard, which is now Google. Karma is a *itch.    Android Pay is replacing Google Wallet.   While Android Pay was unveiled during Google’s big Android M developer preview, it was confirmed that the service will work on all devices on KitKat and above."

Sprint,37qz20,eric101995,3,Wed Jun 3 02:44:24 2015 UTC,"You have a Nexus device, you'll get Android pay. This only applies to pre-loading the app on devices that aren't controlled by Google. Sprint has historically been very willing to work with Google, so I would expect they'll work with them on Android pay too. At the time of the keynote, Google probably had not yet come to terms with Sprint.  Even if you had a device that didn't come pre-loaded with Android pay you could just install the app from the play store."
Sprint,37qz20,evan1123,1 point,Fri May 29 18:40:00 2015 UTC,Softcard was created by at&t Verizon and T-Mobile to compete with Google wallet until Google acquired the IP. Android Pay is the result of the combination of technologies. Sprint was the only major carrier that supported Google wallet and will support android pay when it's released.

Sprint,37ne81,mitten_mike,1 point,Sun May 31 01:58:44 2015 UTC,"The SERO plans have always had special exemptions available that other plans did not, including the SERO Premium options. They aren't standard consumer-oriented plans (they're the employee referral and former employee plans). Even though they're fairly easy to get on your own with a little bit of searching on the Internet, they represent a very small minority of overall plans.   I know on Verizon people keep their old plans by activating online.   This is because Verizon's grandfathering isn't based on the device being activated (as far as I know), but is supposed to be based on you getting a new device through them.   Not only that I believe some of us are on plans that are locked in for life.   This is true for any plan with the Unlimited Guarantee... but that only lasts as long as your plan does. Nothing in that guarantee prevents Sprint from requiring you to change your plan to get a new device in the future, and Sprint has done this in the past. You can keep your plan as long as you want with your device, but a new device could require a plan change for you to activate it."
Sprint,37nvry,Removalsc,7,Fri May 29 00:45:37 2015 UTC,"San Diego is one of Sprint's worst markets, for a number of reasons.  The main issue is Sprint never really built a great network in California, and as a result, they're now having to go back and improve the network by adding more sites.  This takes time of course.  Another issue is that they are blocked from deploying 800MHz LTE, which provides better coverage than 1900MHz and 2500MHz.  Lower frequency = more coverage area from a single tower.  Honestly, you're better off switching to another carrier if you don't want to wait it out."
Sprint,37nvry,evan1123,3,Fri May 29 04:20:13 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I think that may be the only solution.  In /u/B1GEast 's post, what the CEO said is pretty disappointing.  Waiting 1.5-2 years for coverage that Verizon and AT&T had 2 years ago is pretty abysmal."
Sprint,37nvry,evan1123,8,Fri May 29 06:30:49 2015 UTC,"Sprint is highly market dependent. /u/B1GEast made the current state of the network seem  worse than it really is. At this point, LTE is substantially deployed in most markets, but there are some, like Sand Diego, with density issues. This definitely isn't the case everywhere.   Both T-Mobile and Sprint lack rural coverage and both are making strides to improve, but it is gonna take a long time before either rival Verizon/AT&T in terms of coverage area"
Sprint,37nvry,Reddog740,2,Fri May 29 06:47:04 2015 UTC,"Well I drove from Kansas to NYC this past week and had mostly 4g, while tmobile had mostly edge or no service , so I guess it depends.

If I drove up there on a regular basis, I'm sure I would consider sacrificing my data for coverage. But I don't. That's a decision everyone has to make."
Sprint,37nvry,Photojared,-1,Fri May 29 18:58:25 2015 UTC,"Sprint is in the process of upgrading their entire network to LTE. However, it is taking quite a long time to complete for of a number different reasons. Its actually been three years since they first announced these upgrades. But you're in luck, you only have to wait another 18-24 months before things get really good, according to the CEO himself. There isn't anything wrong with your phone, Sprint has a lot of gaps in coverage and even when they complete their upgrades you won't have nationwide LTE coverage. I suggest you find another wireless carrier like ATT/Verizon if that is important to you. There are options like Cricket, GoPhone, or Verizon Prepaid that offer less data but magnitudes more coverage. This is the ultimate cost of unlimited service, you have to put up with islands of coverage."
Sprint,37nvry,chunkyrice,2,Fri May 29 01:16:50 2015 UTC,"I don't need nationwide coverage. I just think in areas like San Diego, Vegas, and NY that any 3g is pretty unacceptable half way through 2015."

Sprint,37nvry,whereswaldow215,1 point,Fri May 29 05:42:51 2015 UTC,The techs are going to ignore and close these reports quickly because they know the regions where upgrades are still happening. So you're just cluttering their logs with angry customers sending reports in areas they can't do anything. The reporting tool is for serious network issues like down/damaged towers or major outages. If the network is running as expected you're making it harder for techs to discern real reports from expected performance and they may be inclined to simply ignore them.

Sprint,37ntif,sparkedman,1 point,Fri May 29 00:26:34 2015 UTC,"T-Mobile's success actually hurts their cause for the 600mhz auction. From the FCC's point of view, they are competing with VZW/ATT in a meaningful way. They see less reason to set aside spectrum today than they would 1 or 2 years ago. This is a problem for TMO because they don't have the capital to make a significant bid and there is a good chance VZW/ATT (and Sprint with that Softbank money) will go all in. I'd still be interested in seeing a joint bid from TMO/Dish/Sprint (or at least some designated entity). The big 2 should not be allowed to buy up all the good spectrum. At the very least there should be rules put in place for how much low-band spectrum you can own per market. VZW/ATT/Sprint already have nationwide low-band spectrum, TMO doesn't."

Sprint,37jiim,alohawolf,2,Thu May 28 15:52:15 2015 UTC,"Problem with 2.5 in urban areas is it basically has zero building penetration.  I'm in Chicago (one of their best built cities) in the Loop right now and coverage is spotty at best once you're inside.  When I'm able to lock on to band 26/800mhz it's too congested to use because everyone is on it.  A chunk of 600 would help a lot.    25 is OK, but I'm almost never on it anymore, I either have 41 or 26 as far as I can tell."

I don't know if it's a balancing issue or what, but we got along fine with B25 coverage before B26 was launched, now, like you, I'm rarely ever on B25. everyone who was on B25 is now on B26 and service in that regard doesn't change, we just get better coverage (barely) and switch 5x5 1900mhz for 5x5 800mhz. B41 has decongested it somewhat, but it's not nearly enough. at night ill speed test and get 20mbps. during the day, 1mbps. my phone will stay on B26 because of coverage all the way up to good B41 coverage. it's like B25 doesn't exist anymore."

Sprint made recent comments that they're basically only going to concentrate on areas where they've already deployed 2.5 GHz so I wouldn't expect much improvement. Along with these statements that they expect to lead in major metro areas and I think it's clear that Sprint is finally realizing that their 2.5 GHz spectrum is really only going to be competitive in dense, urban markets and so they're going to concentrate all of their efforts in these areas rather than fighting a sisyphean battle for customers in less dense areas. I think it really makes sense since they have so much more spectrum than the other 3 I think in a short time if they can actually figure out how to make use of their spectrum, they will be able to provide urban customers with much more data at much higher speeds than the other 3 can. I think with good branding and marketing they will be able to steal away the image as the cool, urban carrier from T-Mobile, particularly as their speeds start coming down due to all of their new sign ups and unlimited users.  In short, if they're not deployed in your area now, I wouldn't hold my breath for them to come, since they're going to concentrate on larger, denser areas, where they have a fighting chance."

So what good does a market-wide average do me? Great, Sprint has the fastest average in a dozen places they specifically draw data from, so what? I've got a brand-spanking new site in my town that can pull down 25-30mbit on all 3 bands, but it doesn't reach where I live. Rootmetrics would say they are #1 if they did all their tests downtown, but for me they would be #4."

Sprint,37jiim,B1GEast,-2,Thu May 28 14:34:25 2015 UTC,You're obsessed with T-Mobile aren't you? Wireless service can vary greatly in any market which is why market-wide averages are mental masturabtion. One of the reasons I use Cricket (AT&T) over T-Mobile (my previous carrier) is that I would pull down 30mbit in one area and 0.5mbit in another. I decided I'd rather have 2-5mbit consistently everywhere (indoor and out) than high speeds within some island of coverage. Sprint will always suffer from this problem because of the type of network they are building and the massive dead zones created by 2.5Ghz (I have them in my own town despite Band 26 running). Legere is absolutely on point about Sprint being a company with a pile of spectrum and no capability. Why the heck do you think Marcelo just went to Japan to beg his overload for money to deploy C-RAN and Small Cells? Densification is Sprint's only plan now. They have given up on expansion (unllike T-Mobile) and decided to focus on urban cores.
Sprint,37jiim,evan1123,6,Thu May 28 22:46:06 2015 UTC,A sham? You should reread the RootMetrics results and their testing methodology. Sprint offers Wi-Fi Calling and a free Wi-Fi Connect Router... Works well for home/business.
Sprint,37jiim,B1GEast,0,Thu May 28 13:42:05 2015 UTC,"All of the metrics are worthless. The only thing that matters is that one customer, can they get service, and are they happy with the service level."
Sprint,37jiim,evan1123,-5,Thu May 28 16:02:28 2015 UTC,"Like I explained to you several times before, their methodology is highly selective, crowd-sourced, and provides no baseline or control for comparison. For example, I can show you places that are 3G-only that Sprint claims has LTE. Rootmetrics does not account for gaps in coverage, dead-zones, or in-building coverage. They do not travel to rural areas or suburbs. They do not enter major site venues or subways. So what is the purpose in knowing a market-wide average if the service does not work in the places that a frequent."
Sprint,37jiim,mitten_mike,4,Thu May 28 13:51:34 2015 UTC,"their methodology is highly selective   Did you even read the methodology? Samples are randomly distributed over a specified market area.   crowd-sourced   RootMetrics does not use ANY crowd sourced data in their testing   Rootmetrics does not account for gaps in coverage, dead-zones, or in-building coverage   Yes, they do   For example, when we test metro areas, our methodology randomly selects indoor test locations, and performance is measured indoors and outdoors at the same locations; drive testing takes place during travel between these randomly selected indoor locations.   Using random sampling accounts for poor coverage areas. They aren't selecting sample locations manually to cherry-pick the best locations.   They do not travel to rural areas or suburbs.   Yes they do, check the state reports. http://www.rootmetrics.com/us/blog/special-reports/year-in-review-2014-us#state  Suburbs are included in market wide reports.  Each market has a map that shows you the area that tests were performed in.  You can clearly see that suburbs are included.   They do not enter major site venues or subways   Subways should be included in indoor testing.  They just started testing event venues this quarter http://www.rootmetrics.com/us/rsr/map/2015-1H?category=data&type=venue"
Sprint,37jiim,B1GEast,1 point,Thu May 28 18:09:39 2015 UTC,"I'll repeat since you missed it:    what is the purpose in knowing a market-wide average if the service does not work in the places that a you frequent.   Perhaps you're being purposely fully ignorant, but Rootmetrics gathers their data through their APP. Market-wide average speed, connectivity, or reliability is a subjective measure that DOES NOT reflect real-world usage in the places most people visit. Rootmetrics testing is a lot like the Better Business Bureau or Yelp. They'll put out all these reports about your business in hopes that you'll pony up some cash for better ratings. Sprint heavily advertises Rootmetrics scores and guess what, they get top results because we don't have open access to their results to dispute their claims.   Tell me, where can I get a full spreadsheet of the tests they ran. Give me that, otherwise its a sham. The other issue is that their reports cover very LARGE market regions.  For example, much of South Jersey is considered part of the Philly market, yet if you were to come out to my area and use Sprint or T-Mobile you would get pretty poor service. If you were to make your wireless decisions based on these reports alone, you would pick the wrong carrier every time."
Sprint,37jiim,mitten_mike,2,Thu May 28 22:27:33 2015 UTC,"Data gathered through the app is NOT used in RootScore reports. RootMetrics performs all of their own testing on a bi-yearly basis and compiles a report based on that testing.  If you seriously think that Sprint pays for better results you're delusional. There are many, many markets where Sprint performs poorly and it shows on the reports.  Obviously RootMetrics alone shouldn't be used to pick a carrier. You should pick a carrier based on other factors besides just looking at a market report. RootMetrics reports do a good job of characterizing mobile network performance to show overall improvement or decline in network quality."

By clarifying for major markets he prevents trolls from using a an area that technically has coverage but does so as a side effect of a different reason for a site deployment, etc.  So Town X in Nebraska has coverage technically, but it's poor coverage.

One of my concerns is that the <5mhz SMR spectrum in many areas isn't enough to economically bridge coverage gaps with sufficient capacity where PCS/BRS isn't cost-effective. Basically, I'm stating my hope that Sprint has a spectrum position that would allow them to realistically build a native network whose coverage looks like Verizon's."
Sprint,37jiim,vitaminjay1982,2,Thu May 28 05:39:49 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately without a little more low band spectrum we likely won't see that. Sprint has plenty of high-band spectrum to handle capacity, it's just going to take a while to deploy it due to the number of sites needed. The 1900MHz is what the legacy network was designed for, but LTE doesn't quite propagate as well which is causing some issues. As for 800MHz, it isn't meant to be a primary band, it's meant to be the absolute last fallback when everything else isn't available. So the amount of spectrum available is sufficient but not ideal obviously."
Sprint,37jiim,mitten_mike,1 point,Thu May 28 07:25:29 2015 UTC,I suppose so. I'd imagine that BRS would need a substantial build-out to relieve congestion on the often crowded and small PCS channels.
Sprint,37jiim,vitaminjay1982,1 point,Thu May 28 07:57:48 2015 UTC,"The infrastructure for wide deployment of BRS is there, its almost trivial to convert a clearwire site to LTE."
Sprint,37jiim,mitten_mike,-1,Thu May 28 15:54:24 2015 UTC,"Sprint has to be vying for a big chunk of 600MHz spectrum...   Recently, Sprint CFO Joe Euteneuer had strong words about the company’s need for future spectrum. At the J.P. Morgan Global Technology, Media and Telecom Conference, Euteneuer said the major carrier doesn’t necessarily need to participate in next year’s 600 MHz broadcast incentive wireless spectrum auction. Now, Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure, is weighing in on the subject, hoping to clarify Sprint’s stance on their need to participate in the auction.  While Enteneuer made it appear that Sprint is quite comfortable working with the spectrum they already have, Claure was quick to point out that he believes there are major opportunities available in the low-band spectrum auction.  “As it relates to the 600 MHz spectrum option, we all know it’s an opportunity – once-in-life opportunity to acquire low-banded spectrum and a critical input for cost-effective deployment of wide area coverage.” Claure said in a recent earnings call. “So to us, it’s important to understand what are the auction rules going to be to make sure that smaller carriers like us have a fair opportunity to acquire this competitive input.”  This comes after Euteneuer said, “I think if you would have asked that question two years ago, people would have said … maybe you need to do something more for low band,” he explained. “But today, no one that we know has the Wi-Fi layer out there, knowing that every building out there has Wi-Fi whether you’re in your home or in your office and given the 800 now will be complete nationwide, it really gives you a pause to say ‘do you really need something?’ ”  Euteneuer said the rationale for his comments is that by next year, Sprint expects to already have the majority of its 800 MHz and 2.5 GHz network largely built out and is also looking at Wi-Fi to give its network more capacity. He believes Sprint’s 2×20 MHz carrier aggregation in the 2.5 GHz band is also a key part of the company’s improving LTE network.     According to Marcelo's comments, it seems like Son over at SoftBank was willing to open his wallet after that meeting..."
Sprint,37jiim,vitaminjay1982,1 point,Thu May 28 04:30:03 2015 UTC,"Hm, interesting deduction. I hope that Sprint does get involved in the 600 auction. It would be cool if Sprint, T-Mobile, and possibly USCC or Cellular South were able to get substantial chunks of spectrum for expansion."
Sprint,37jiim,vitaminjay1982,0,Thu May 28 04:58:08 2015 UTC,"Son over at SoftBank is going to have to open his wallet for this, but it will happen."
Sprint,37jiim,wewewawa,1 point,Thu May 28 11:50:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I feel that purchasing spectrum like this is so essential and also a good investment.  If it doesn't work out, another carrier will gladly buy it off you for a good price.  Son should know this and I hope he funds it appropriately."
Sprint,37jiim,vitaminjay1982,1 point,Thu May 28 12:57:43 2015 UTC,This is all garbage. Go to Overland Park and use Sprint. In Sprint's own hometown Verizon service is better! Try using an LTE modem in Overland Park.. good luck getting LTE speeds.

Sprint,37jg3c,sparkedman,3,Fri May 29 15:31:00 2015 UTC,"seriously, the death of unlimited doesn't spell the death of worry-free data access. 100gb is as good as unlimited for almost every person on Sprint, even 50gb is enough where people would likely not notice. there's a huge difference between 50, 100, and 200gb tiers, and 1, 3, or 5gb. one greatly inhibits use of the network, the other adds extra cost to heavy users/abusers.   http://s4gru.com/index.php?/topic/6992-s4gru-members-average-monthly-data-usage-with-poll/  just THREE of 156 users reported using over 60gb of data on a regular basis. and this is from a Sprint enthusiasts website. the 2nd lowest tier, at 10-15gb (im in there) had 46 people..the top 3 users overall use the network as much as those 46 customers. 1 heavy user = ~15 normal users. Sprint is sacrificing the service of those 15 users for 1 heavy user, yet they all pay the same price for service. is that fair to those 15 people? would it be unfair to ask the heavy user to pay extra for their extra usage? not if Sprint doesn't ask them to.  knowing this, what if Sprint did away with unlimited, but still had massive data pools, like 50gb to share? that would be more than enough for all but 3 of those people.  without context, how can anyone take this statement as gospel? do you REALLY think Claure is SO stupid as to kill the only advantage they have over the big 2 right now? give him more credit than that. this is a 'philosophizing', 'what do you think the wireless industry will look like in 20 years' kind of statement. and he's right, Verizon and AT&T are going to lower their costs per gb, and Sprint and T-Mobile will have to abandon 'unlimited' (they've both already started with prioritizing the top 5% of users)."

Sprint,37jg3c,rangoon03,5,Thu May 28 02:19:58 2015 UTC,"Unlimited is guaranteed... however it does not make guarantees on speed. All of those plans, and nearly every plan since has stated Sprint reserves the right to prioritize other plans. So you might get unlimited... but it might be more limited if a lot of other people with non-unlimited plans are using the network (likely implemented the same way the top network usage abusers are handled with network prioritization)."
Sprint,37jg3c,halcyoncmdr,7,Thu May 28 04:36:23 2015 UTC,"I'm actually OK with this kind of prioritization.  If the bandwidth is there, you get it no mater what.  If there's saturation, those who've used less get a bigger chunk of what's available.  It all depends on the implementation though, it could be completely awful if done wrong."
Sprint,37jg3c,legion02,3,Thu May 28 13:06:38 2015 UTC,That's the intention of it exactly. Many people don't seem to understand it's not throttling in a traditional sense like AT&T or T-Mobile.

Sprint,37jg3c,sparkedman,1 point,Thu May 28 13:46:18 2015 UTC,Sprint has been saying that for a while. They are right though. At some point unlimited data will have to go.
Sprint,37jg3c,evan1123,7,Thu May 28 02:42:13 2015 UTC,Unlimited data does not have to go away. We have done so much to adopt standards and practices that allow for high speed data to meet the demand of media content...people should demand unlimited data.
Sprint,37jg3c,panjadotme,1 point,Fri May 29 01:29:56 2015 UTC,"it's like torrenting.

Sprint,37jg3c,mitten_mike,1 point,Fri May 29 18:27:09 2015 UTC,There are better ways to manage traffic than to blanket ban unlimited data for all. When there are certain carriers that allow unlimited streaming for certain services in backroom deals (ie. Spotify with tmobile) I know this isn't an available bandwidth issue it's a way to make more money.
Sprint,37jg3c,panjadotme,1 point,Fri May 29 19:51:43 2015 UTC,Why will unlimited data have to go?
Sprint,37jg3c,SynysterSaint,1 point,Fri May 29 08:21:31 2015 UTC,"it's like this. you go to an all you can eat Chinese buffet.   some people, reasonable people, would say ""oh nice, variety, I don't have to worry about picking a restaurant. i'll have a little bit of everything. this is a normal dinner.""  OTHER people, unreasonable people, will say ""oh wow, all I can eat, I better eat as much as I can or I won't get my money's worth! this is a challenge!""  with some people, and some things, 'unlimited' encourages consumption. Sprint doesn't want to be the Chinese restaurant all the competitive eaters come to to gorge themselves."
Sprint,37jg3c,mitten_mike,0,Fri May 29 18:32:33 2015 UTC,"Unlimited will never go away, data consumption has grown exponentially and it is the only value point that separates Sprint/TMO from Verizon/ATT. Data consumption has outpaced the most conservative estimates every year. Kids growing up with Netflix and Spotify will not put up with data caps. We have already seen data buckets nearly triple in two years at the same price point. At this rate your standard 10-20GB family plan (~$140) will be around 40GB in 2 years (at that point, it's unlimited). I believe the opposite will happen, unlimited service will become speed tiered."

People are consuming mobile content at a rate faster than ever before and ""connected device"" sales are outpacing all other devices. Unless WiFi networks are as widely available as Mobile network, data usage will continue to increase at exponential rates. Providers will be forced to increase buckets (which we have already seen go from 2GB --> 20GB in 2 years) within the same price range. Unlimited is the ultimate price differentiator. With young people using apps like Periscope, Vine, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, and Instagram you're not going to see people use less data. What we will see is capped unlimited, because we don't need to deliver 50mbit to every device when most high bandwidth service max out at 5mbit."

Not to mention, even a friend of mine with T-Mobile talks about how rare it is to drop from 4G on his phone.  I don't mean to rant, but I think Sprint can do better and T-Mobile is a prime example of that seeing as they have less spectrum and cover more land area than Sprint does on LTE, despite them starting years later on deployment."

Sprint,37i9au,vitaminjay1982,1 point,Wed May 27 21:36:30 2015 UTC,Correct. Only massive companies have such leverage to have AT&T give them Unlimited Data still.  I know Boeing employees can also get unlimited data on Verizon even if they're a new customer.
Sprint,37i9au,mitten_mike,2,Thu May 28 02:34:35 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily leverage... more likely it's a contractual obligation that was originally agreed to.

You generally have Otterbox Commuter and Defender in black, an LG flip case in one or two colors, and a cheap better-than-nothing option. I seriously doubt they will ever offer the backs as in-store accessories because there are a lot of options that won't sell equally well, and Sprint doesn't order things like that for most phones. (Exception: The Otterbox Design Lab for iPhone and Galaxy with a ton of colors that meet that exact description.)  It's sad.

But while Sprint is improving, it's not like ATT and Verizon are taking a break or something, they are also improving at an equivalent rate as well."
Sprint,37i1w0,breakerwaves,3,Thu May 28 13:24:51 2015 UTC,"Things will always be business as usual, no matter what the Magentans will say otherwise.  Both Sprint and T-Mobile have core urban networks, and very little coverage outside of those areas. Unless there is a huge network expansion project OUTSIDE of what current exists with LTE updates, etc., those customers will not be swayed to switch carriers.   Customers in rural areas, wooded areas, places where it's tough to get cell service, will not be ready to switch, because they would be downgrading on service, to save a few bucks a month.  Honestly, if Verizon were to lower their prices, T-Mobile would be in a lot of trouble."
Sprint,37i1w0,stylz168,2,Wed May 27 20:09:17 2015 UTC,"Both Sprint and T-Mobile have core urban networks, and very little coverage outside of those areas. Unless there is a huge network expansion project OUTSIDE of what current exists with LTE updates, etc., those customers will not be swayed to switch carriers.   Sprint is tackling this through Competitive Carriers Association roaming agreements. The CCA agreements will allow for mutual roaming as if it were native coverage (without the requirement for each network to build out in those rural areas). The rural carriers do their thing in the areas they know, but they get the advantage of advertising nationwide coverage just like Sprint advertises the rural coverage there.  Historically, Sprint has tried to avoid buying the smaller carriers in favor of roaming agreements (whether ""native"" or not). Most of the exceptions to this were due to that smaller carrier becoming a constant thorn in the side instead of an asset (like iPCS after the Nextel merger). Granted with iPCS, their claims were fairly legitimate."
Sprint,37i1w0,halcyoncmdr,1 point,Thu May 28 04:25:57 2015 UTC,"Yep I know, most of the affiliate purchases came out of non-compete clauses post merger."
Sprint,37i1w0,stylz168,3,Thu May 28 05:25:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if Verizon were to lower their prices, T-Mobile would be in a lot of trouble.   I'm not sure about that.  While their coverage dwarfs T-Mo and their calling network is unsurpassed, their data sucks from what I often hear. Users are often kicked down to 3G, which is like molasses.  What I'm asking is, will Sprint and T-Mo together doing great be able to force change from the Big Two?  My main gripe as a T-Mo sub has always been dropping to EDGE (2G) upon leaving a metropolitan area, but they've made great strides in that area."
Sprint,37i1w0,phantom240,5,Wed May 27 20:13:52 2015 UTC,"As a former Verizon customer, I can tell you that in my area, data was fantastic. I wasn't in a major metropolitan area, but a suburb 20 miles north of New Orleans. My daily commute brought me 40 miles west, a lot of which is rural, and had steady service to and from work every day. Unfortunately, my constant streaming of music and heavy web usage made Verizon's service cost-prohibitive after going over my 10gb data limit three months in a row.  If Verizon dropped their prices on metered data plans and offered an unlimited data plan again at an elevated price, I think they could really put the other players in a tight spot.   Sprint will never be a big player in the wireless game, I believe. Reception on my commute was/is (currently on Sprint) fair to poor with my iPhone 5s, and fair with my HTC M9. However, while at work, my iPhone was a bit sketchy on data connection, while my M9 is completely worthless. I think the phones operate on different bands, and the local tower was better suited for my old iPhone. It's a real drag that I finally get out of the iOS rabbit hole, find a phone I love, but can't use it because Sprint sucks."
Sprint,37i1w0,stylz168,5,Wed May 27 20:37:07 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately you're in one of the underdeployed markets on the Sprint network. Download NoLA is pretty rock solid, but the outlying areas are the unfortunate mess of one of Sprint's old affiliates who built a really crappy network, and left it in Sprint's hands like a crying baby.  There will always be a number 3 and 4 carrier, and in this age of stealing customers from each other, will always have some flip flop between them. Think about this, Sprint could buy out T-Mobile tomorrow, and the new company would still be number 3. That, combined with the excess in costs from running disparate networks, would be a disaster."
Sprint,37i1w0,halcyoncmdr,2,Wed May 27 21:34:38 2015 UTC,"That, combined with the excess in costs from running disparate networks, would be a disaster.   Welcome to Nextel 2.0 if that happened. The only way to do it is to decommission an entire network and consolidate the spectrum. Eventually this is what Sprint decided to do, but it took way too long to do it."
Sprint,37i1w0,phantom240,2,Thu May 28 04:28:09 2015 UTC,"Luckily, the Sprint/TMo merger was shot down. Over the course of my (mostly) adult life, I've been with Sprint for 7 out of the 14 years I've had a cell phone. Of course, it wasn't all continuous, as I hopped to Verizon for a couple of years, 2012-2013. What really pushed my buttons with Sprint back when I got my first [Boost Mobile] phone was the exceptionally poor coverage in some of the areas I had to travel to for work, and this was back in the days before data was a concern. After that phone, I got the Samsung Instinct from Sprint, and signed a contract. The spotty/inadequate data coverage became apparent to me at this point. Still, as a Premier member, I got yearly upgrades and the service was okay for the price. I stuck it out. Then Sprint scrapped the Premier program two months before I was eligible for an upgrade. On top of that, I was paying an extra $10 a month for 4G data on an ""unlimited data"" plan. I was paying $10 a month for WiMax service in an area that never saw WiMax deployment. After bringing it up to Sprint's customer service almost incessantly, I noticed a few months later they tried to save face and changed the charge to ""premium data"". Fed up with paying for services I would never receive, I jumped ship.   I know I've rambled on way too long here, but my point is that I have zero faith in Sprint deploying/upgrading/maintaining the network in my area of the country. The only thing keeping me from giving T-Mobile a shot is the $700 credit hold to test drive their service."
Sprint,37i1w0,stylz168,1 point,Fri May 29 14:08:05 2015 UTC,"What area is this? Would really help in verifying any updates.  Also keep in mind that unlike Clearwire's WiMAX deployment, Sprint is deploying LTE on every single cell site possible. There is a huge difference from Clearwire's localized approach. I have personally seen the work being done, been on cell sites first hand, and can definitely speak to the improvements.   I now rarely see 3G on my commute, where a year ago, would have not been the case."
Sprint,37i1w0,kevinyeaux,5,Fri May 29 16:21:42 2015 UTC,"I know the area you're in very well, you'd likely be better served by T-Mobile. Not to come in and overstep a discussion about Sprint, but assuming you're on the north shore, the I-10/I-12 corridor is covered very well by TMo, with the option for unlimited data (although more expensive than Sprint).  To answer the original question, there will always be places where AT&T and VZW are better than the challengers. I think the more important problem is breaking the perception. If you look what TMo is doing with massive expansion of their LTE footprint in 2015, and Sprint's discussion about densifying their network for data improvements and using 800 SMR to their advantage as TMo is with their limited 700 holdings, I think they're both trying to get to the point where coverage, for 90% of potential customers, isn't a breaking point to switch. But it will take a while for the perception to catch up to reality, even after one or both networks gets there.  To put it another way, both challengers tried being urban-only players (T-Mobile especially, Sprint always seemed to want to play more in rural/suburban markets). Both are changing course, because there is a limit to your potential market share in that game. Americans aren't afraid to pay more for better coverage, and both companies are catching up."
Sprint,37i1w0,phantom240,1 point,Thu May 28 01:22:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm on the northshore. Nobody I talk to has any experience with T-Mobile service here, which makes me a bit wary."
Sprint,37i1w0,stylz168,2,Fri May 29 14:09:02 2015 UTC,"Their data is actually a lot better than what complainers complain about. I'm saying this as a Sprint customer.   T-Mo is doing their 2G to LTE conversion right now, which will help create those islands of LTE where 2G only existed before. The challenge of course is the limited PCS spectrum they have in the area, and getting backhaul in place for those 2G sites. In that instance they will be in the same boot that Sprint is in now trying to get back haul in their Network Vision sites.  Right now Verizon and AT&T have 110+ million subscribers, with Sprint and T-Mobile basically at 53 million. Think about that for a second. Sprint has one saving grace (2.5ghz spectrum) which will allow them to support an additional 10-20 million subscribers, but unfortunately T-Mobile does not have that same blanket.  Both carriers need to invest in site deployment, not just to densify existing networks, but expand into new ones."
Sprint,37i1w0,halcyoncmdr,1 point,Wed May 27 21:30:02 2015 UTC,"T-Mobile does not have that same blanket.   T-Mobile's current blanket is the one AT&T was forced to contractually give them in the form of spectrum ($1 billion worth) and cash ($3 billion) when their merger fell through. AT&T seems to have been so confident in it happening that they basically took what looks like the first deal T-Mobile offered. T-Mobile on the other hand was entirely hedging their bet from the start as evidenced by that contract.  That blanket will run out soon as that spectrum is used and additional isn't available, the cash required to bid effectively on new spectrum may not be available after the CAPEX required in the initial build-out, or even after getting the spectrum having the cash required to utilize it."
Sprint,37i1w0,linuxlearningnewbie,2,Thu May 28 04:32:41 2015 UTC,"I doubt Sprint will ever take a number 1 or 2 spot. It is just not in the numbers.   Sprint lacks the number of subscribes. They lack the diversity of services (home phone, tv) And they are saddled with too much debt."
Sprint,37i1w0,mitten_mike,1 point,Thu May 28 15:53:55 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge fan of Sprint but I also give credit where it's due, and T-Mobile basically forced every other carrier into changing their ways. First with phones, and now with data pricing. That being said, they also started an extremely aggressive fight with their entire industry and made an enemy of all their competitors. It's one thing to compete, business as usual (ala Sprint), it's another to aggressively pursue your competitors customers, literally throwing money at them to switch. They had an easy time basically stepping over an ailing Sprint to take 3rd place, they're about to hit a brick wall trying to bring down the big 2.  They need to focus less on being aggressive, and more on being a sustainable business. Sprint, for their lack of performance, has got long-term written all over them. T-Mobile has 'flash in the pan' written all over them, which explains why the big 2 are basically brushing them off.   Like others have said, AT&T and Verizon only need to drop their prices to steal back every customer they lost to T-Mobile. Cricket's 20gb for $55 promotion was evidence of that. But they're not stupid. They know T-Mobile's strategy for getting customers to switch is unsustainable, and they know they can get people to switch back.  Where Sprint fits into all this is that they're looking to compete with Verizon and AT&T, like they used to, on a nationwide level, and not as a 'niche' network. They're not looking to win 'data hogs' or 'enthusiasts', they want everyone; families, businesses, individuals, travelers, etc. Unlimited for them is a come on for convenience, not an all you can eat buffet (which they also know is unsustainable). Same with leasing, it's just really convenient, and it keeps their costs low. They aren't rushing VoLTE because they don't care about saying 'me first', they want it working right. CA is usable, they've demonstrated it, but they haven't turned it on because it's not ready. We've seen what they've done to Chicago, and there's nothing 'special' about Chicago.   In the game of business, Sprint is what you would call a 'sleeping giant'."

Sprint,37cpcf,Chase1029,10,Tue May 26 17:42:14 2015 UTC,"are you really asking why a Verizon phone has better coverage than a Sprint phone?  they have a larger network.  not only that but LTE doesn't carry (generally) as far as older technologies, assuming the frequencies are the same. 3g on Sprint would reach further than LTE on the same band. that old phone could be 3g only - while yours has LTE. if you turned off LTE on your iPhone you might get a LOT better signal on 3g, but it's slower. You can get full bars of EVDO (3g) but 1 bar of LTE.   but that aside, Verizon has a much more robust network than Sprint, and the price reflects that."
Sprint,37cpcf,mitten_mike,4,Tue May 26 17:55:11 2015 UTC,So basically Verizon is just better?
Sprint,37cpcf,StinkyDogFarts,8,Tue May 26 18:20:12 2015 UTC,Yes.
Sprint,37cpcf,mitten_mike,5,Tue May 26 18:22:25 2015 UTC,"I didn't say they're better, I said they have a larger and more robust network.  AT&T and Verizon have larger networks, but also cost the most and limit usage of their networks.  Sprint and T-Mobile have smaller networks, but also cost the least and give you free reign of their networks.  Depends on your definition of 'better'.  You could downgrade your LTE to 3g and get probably 2x better coverage, if that's the only thing that matters to you."
Sprint,37cpcf,zakats,2,Tue May 26 18:36:44 2015 UTC,"If by better you mean that they've got a superb monopoly on the most continuous, furthest carrying signal that allows the easiest network build-out of any US carrier and is literally 1/4 to 1/6 the cost to build for the same carrier as Sprint until recently (note: there are caveats here but this is true in the grand scheme of things). Sprint't 800mhz licenses are not as clean and easy as Verizon's 750mhz but they will be put to use and help expand 'strong coverage' as it rolls out. BTW, lower frequency coverage results in stronger signal/distance/building penetration.  So, yeah, Verizon has a firm grip on the ""best"" network because they have a huge advantage which reeeeally doesn't work well for the American people. ATT has a similar situation and then the smaller carriers [Sprint & T-Mobile] are given a position to where it's impossible to reach the same profit margin.  TL;DR: It's because Verizon has a duopoly with AT&T. Sprint is only recently getting access to resources that can compete with Verizon and it'll take time to implement."
Sprint,37cpcf,linuxlearningnewbie,1 point,Wed May 27 00:53:51 2015 UTC,Overall you are going to have better coverage with Verizon for voice. Data can be equal or Verizon will win in some markets. Verizon will be more expensive and you will not have unlimited data.

Honestly, if all you have is one or two lines, leasing or financing a new device on one of the new plans will save you a TON of money.  edit: now I see that it's 2 lines.

Sprint,37dnc0,praemonitus_,1 point,Tue May 26 21:39:07 2015 UTC,"Keep your current plan and add the $15 credit. $128 a month for two lines is fine before phone costs. If you leased two iPhone 6s (assuming the credit is available for both lines), you'd be out $240 on phones over 24 months instead of $400. Just make sure you take care of the phones.   I'd suggest AppleCare+ on both if you go iPhone (extra $99 each) just to be safe since they cover everything that would prevent you from turning in an acceptable device at the end of the leading period.   Add the Speck Candy Shell case and a $5-10 tempered glass screen protector from Amazon and you should be good. (I use those accessories and have AppleCare+. It's good for everyday protection without the hassle of Lifeproof cases. If it gets wet, you pay Apple a couple hundred bucks for a replacement.)"

Sprint,379uxc,ruben3232,1 point,Tue May 26 04:29:03 2015 UTC,"No because Sprint wants you off their network when you're at home.   There's a reason both Sprint and T-mobile came out with WiFi routers that they offer to subscribers and it's not just because of Wifi Calling, it's because they want people to use the brand new spanking top of the line AC router while at home. That's what I would say is the primary motive.  If you must have a LTE signal at home you can look into the LTE repeaters from third party vendors like Wilson. Just make sure it's compatible with the Band 25/26 or 41 frequencies."
Sprint,379uxc,Mr_You,2,Tue May 26 04:43:11 2015 UTC,"Totally understand that and it makes plenty of sense, except in this particular situation that isn't possible and I don't think it's fair that a signal booster or extender should cost nearly a thousand dollars."

Sprint,379uxc,evan1123,1 point,Tue May 26 01:34:56 2015 UTC,First you might check what bands are available on your phone and the tower you're using.  If you're stuck with 1900Mhz (band class 25) then you'll need a signal booster like those available from weboost.com.  Otherwise 800Mhz (band class 26) will help with coverage and building penetration if the phone and tower are capable.  I've not come across any Sprint 800Mhz/B26 capable signal boosters.
Sprint,379uxc,ruben3232,2,Tue May 26 01:40:57 2015 UTC,"Tri-band device. The tower in the area has band 25 and 26 and I do get 26 on the lower level, but it still doesn't help with speed. 3G down there is anywhere from 10-50Kbps   Edit- no way in hell I'm shelling out a grand to get better speeds."
Sprint,379uxc,evan1123,1 point,Tue May 26 01:53:41 2015 UTC,Agreed on that edit. It'd be nice if Sprint followed T-Mobile's steps in contacting all of the subscribers (T-Mo is in that process) and offering them either a signal booster for non-wifi calling devices or a Cellspot for those with WiFi Calling phoned.
Sprint,379uxc,ruben3232,1 point,Tue May 26 02:08:15 2015 UTC,It would he amazing. Even if I had WiFi calling it wouldn't help seeing as there is no Internet in the house.

Sprint,375wu0,roberts2727,4,Mon May 25 15:34:10 2015 UTC,"The router DMZ won't help with audio quality. The DMZ helps if it won't activate at all.  What the DMZ does is put the device outside your network firewall, so all connection in and out are allowed (this removes an effective security layer, and is not meant to be a permanent solution but a temporary feature to see if the firewall is causing a connection issue. Since the issue is with audio cutting out, the connection is being made, the bandwidth simply isn't available.  This could either be the OP's network bandwidth from their ISP, or it could be that the router they are using can't cope with the network traffic they are doing on their home network (A lot of consumer-grade routers have issues with torrents and the large numbers of concurrent connections that some with that for instance).  If it's either of those issues then setting up QoS to a higher priority in the router settings for VoIP calls would likely correct the audio quality issues, unless the OP's connection from his ISP is extremely slow to start with."
Sprint,375wu0,halcyoncmdr,1 point,Mon May 25 16:55:23 2015 UTC,"Actually a DMZ can help with audio quality issues depending on the router manufacturer. There are many router manufacturers that set the DMZ to bypass router QOS settings. If the router is heavily prioritised  putting the phone in the DMZ can actually improve the bandwidth the device receives helping to fix the issue with choppy audio without him having to go and change QOS for other applications on the router. I should have warned him about it removing the firewall.

I get paid a flat rate for activations and a flat rate for upgrades with no specific quotas to meet. I make x amount as a bonus if my survey results are above certain criteria and have no expectation for TEP attachment etc. We collectively make money through S&R depending on our quintile rank and number of tickets done though

Sprint,36w4bq,mschmitt23,5,Fri May 22 16:41:53 2015 UTC,"Iirc you can't be 'forced' onto a new plan, not on any carrier. Contracts go both ways; while you're obligated to stay with the carrier until your obligation is fulfilled, they're obligated to continue the service you agreed to, as outlined in your contract (which typically goes month to month after your 24 months are over). Sprint has been really good about honoring past plans, even the ones they make very little money from, case and point : Framily.  When your contract is over, your part is pretty much done. You agreed to pay off your devices and have service for 24 months, you did that, now your service is month to month until you decide you want to upgrade or switch (plans, not phones. You can always add or remove phones as you wish. Whether they're subsidized or not is another story.)"
Sprint,36w4bq,mitten_mike,1 point,Fri May 22 17:13:39 2015 UTC,"I think I get that part. What I'm worried about is that in October, when our contract is over, we'll want to upgrade to new (subsidized) phones, which will require signing a new 2-year contract. I'm worried we won't be able to renew this plan with a new contract to get subsidized new phones at that point."
Sprint,36w4bq,Photojared,1 point,Fri May 22 20:03:49 2015 UTC,Sprint is not obligated to keep old plans.   What's your hesitation with new plans?  They're most likely going to be more inexpensive for you.
Sprint,36w4bq,sparkedman,0,Sat May 23 06:10:49 2015 UTC,"Not in all cases. Total cost over 2 years is what matters.  Sprint's Unlimited My Way and Framily Plans also have the Unlimited for Life guarantee. The new plans don't.  My shared line cost on Unlimited My Way (5 lines) is ~$50/month after corporate discount is factored in (22% on data portion). If I chose to do Easy Pay instead of a 2 year contract on this plan, I would wind up paying more over 2 years. Same goes for leasing according to how the math comes out."
Sprint,36w4bq,thecodemonk,2,Sat May 23 18:22:57 2015 UTC,"You can keep your plan, at least right now. I did. Just be aware, that if you do a lease or buy the device not under a 2 year contract but pay for it monthly, you will pay more then you would if you change plans. I was on the same plan as you with two phones and my bill was going to go up the amount of the 2 phone payments.. By switching plans, my monthly bill stayed the same even with adding insurance to both phones when we only had it on one before.  They still offer an unlimited data plan for 100/more for 2 phones.  You have to go through care to get it, so I dont know how long that plan will be around..."
Sprint,36w4bq,thecodemonk,2,Fri May 22 17:13:56 2015 UTC,Thanks! I intend to not lease or Easy Pay or any of those -- just a normal subsidized purchase with a new 2-year contract.

Sprint,36w4bq,sparkedman,1 point,Sat May 23 00:47:51 2015 UTC,"I pay $170/month for 4 lines now. The Everything Plus plan is an employee referral plan. We have 3 iPhone 5 phones on the plan (which probably averaged out $100 each, or around there, I don't quite remember) and 1 Samsung S3 ($0) on the plan. I'd likely just upgrade to more recent models of each. Since it would be in October I don't have specific models in mind yet.  To get 3 iPhone 6 phones and 1 S5 now with a lease plan, Sprint's website says I'd pay $220 for 8GB data share plan ($60 ""access fee"" for 4 devices, $70 for the plan, $90 for device payments). So, $50 more per month for giving up unlimited data, but getting new phones.  If that's what I end up having to do, that'd be fine. I really only opened this discussion looking for insight into whether people were being pushed off the Everything Plus employee referral plan."

I don't trust the maps when they tell me I'm going to have X band or Y technology, as there are many other mitigating factors, including weather, cell site load, and any tower work.

Exactly, if there is no recent drive testing for a specific area they will use an algorithm based on topology (which does not take into account foliage that can severely affect service in many instances) and estimated interference from known outside sources (like buildings, other cell sites both for the company and others, or other nearby powerful RF sources). This is also why all coverage maps state that they are for high-level estimates (meaning the map is based on perfect circumstances, outdoors)."
Sprint,36r8f2,halcyoncmdr,2,Fri May 22 10:31:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think that tower location is correct given the propagation pattern of band 41 depicted on the map.   Still, coverage maps do seen to overstate band 41 coverage. Sprint's not the only one at fault, all carriers generally have overstated LTE maps."
Sprint,36r8f2,evan1123,1 point,Thu May 21 14:23:14 2015 UTC,"I'm around -80db on any of the three bands around that site (other 2 towers are miles away). I actually saw the work being done about 2 months ago. I don't know why they aren't blasting the signal though because Band 41 doesn't go beyond 100 yards of that tower, Band 25 will go 0.5miles, Band 26 will go up to 1 mile. Beyond that (red line on my map) you're on 1x800 and 3G. I should add the reason the maps looks like that is because I am surrounded by a forest (Pine Barrens) which blocks most coverage because of the TALL trees. However, my gripe isn't with the signal, its how grossly overstated the maps really is.  edit: Here is the corresponding area on Sensorly. According to Sprint that red area should be Spark and LTE, it's barely 3G."
Sprint,36r8f2,evan1123,3,Thu May 21 14:32:15 2015 UTC,"The tower you have circled on the map is only 3G accepted as of earlier this month.

Sprint,36r8f2,evan1123,2,Thu May 21 15:18:03 2015 UTC,"They need a coverage reinforcement site in that area. There may be one planed or they may not deem it a high priority right now. Depending on the height of the tower in Brown Hills, it may not be designed to cover much greater area. The dense forest in the area definitely causes an issue, but the coverage maps don't account for that"
Sprint,36r8f2,graesen,1 point,Thu May 21 15:49:21 2015 UTC,Possible. ATT has 700 LTE on the same tower but they manage to cover a much wider area. T-Mobile has Band 12 on an even further tower and it reaches my house. Oddly enough I can get 1x800 at home but I can't get 800 LTE. I'm just flabbergasted at the claims made on the coverage map.
Sprint,36r8f2,TerryYockey,1 point,Thu May 21 16:44:06 2015 UTC,"1x800 has vastly superior coverage to LTE 800. I've maintained a 1x800 connection up to 20 miles from the nearest tower.  LTE 800 probably still needs some optimization work.  EDIT: Even though T-Mobile has a tower further away, it may be taller than Sprint's, which would provide the better propagation needed."
Sprint,36r8f2,praemonitus_,2,Thu May 21 16:47:21 2015 UTC,"I spoke with a representative from emailing the CEO last year and the response to this was that they cannot accurately measure the coverage of each tower in all areas or account for environmental restrictions.

I haven't switched since a family member depends on voice coverage and the T-Mobile network is tiny and AT&T voice quality sucks.

Sprint,36m4bs,mitten_mike,2,Wed May 20 11:55:49 2015 UTC,It depends. 2G -> LTE areas should be similar. Then my city is only 10MHz on TMo. Spring has a good bit of B41 deployed. Then some markets that have 15x15 deployed like Knoxville are backhaul limited to basically 5x5.   But then TMo iis winning markets in rootmetric reports. So it really just varies. Test a network before switching. I didn't join TMo cause of lots of deadzones around my house which TMo map shows to be perfect signal even though it is really edge of cell area. And Sprint has way better roaming coverage.
Sprint,36m4bs,mitten_mike,2,Wed May 20 15:09:01 2015 UTC,"I had a massive deadspot in my commute that dropped to 2g which their map said was 'good' LTE. I liked MetroPCS when I had it in the city, but I just can't give up the (believe it or not) better CS and coverage, especially indoors, now that I'm on Sprint. If Sprint is atrocious in your area though, no reason to stick with them. It shouldn't be a blanket criticism of Sprint, but I mean, results vary by geographical location, as they do with all carriers."

Sprint,36kepq,praemonitus_,0,Wed May 20 01:04:13 2015 UTC,"What if you don’t want AT&T Next and would rather sign a 2-year agreement? Local Dealer locations will still technically be able to sign you up for a 2-year agreement via Direct Fulfillment, which is like them placing an order for you in store and then shipping the device to you a few days later. In other words, you wouldn’t see your new phone for a couple of days in some cases. You will also be able to sign-up for 2-year agreements at Company Owned Retail locations, customer service, and att.com. Other than that, AT&T Next is your option and will be the option presented to you.   This would have reduced so much hassle and so many bad metrics had Sprint taken this approach."
Sprint,36kepq,evan1123,1 point,Wed May 20 01:05:17 2015 UTC,"Sprint has had huge success with their leasing and EasyPay installment plans. The two year contract isn't really popular with new subscribers, nor is it pushed by retail employees.  There will still be plenty of people on AT&T continuing their two year contracts because they think it's cheaper to get a new phone that way, even if they have to wait."
Sprint,36kepq,Linny911,2,Wed May 20 01:40:01 2015 UTC,"It's not popular because it's designed to be so. New subscribers will end up paying $600-840 (25-35 per month for 24m depending on your plan) for having the privilege of signing 2 year contract, not including the device upfront cost of typically $200, plus threat of termination fee if one leaves. They will literally end up paying more than what the device costs.  I pity the new subscribers who signed up for 2 year contract. For those on legacy plans, contract is great."
Sprint,36kepq,myfapaccount_istaken,0,Wed May 20 01:46:13 2015 UTC,"Um, did you work there when the initial change took place? I'm not saying it wasn't successful. I'm saying AT&T is giving their reps a way to deal with customers that Sprint didn't. People wanted two-year contracts after corporate said to basically never do them, and it killed metrics. AT&T is saying they aren't using in-store inventory for contracts, and I imagine that using direct fulfillment will prevent the reps from being penalized for customers making the decisions they feel are best for them.   And all of your points are moot since Sprint doesn't advertise contracts anymore, nor are any of their new customer offers remotely appealing in contract terms. For legacy customers who want their grandfathered plans and subsidized pricing, saying direct fulfillment is the only choice is a better option than being told to change your plan type to something more expensive or just live with it."

Sprint,36i47h,MrNagant,2,Wed May 20 01:24:20 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Sprint has no reason to be publicly honest about this, in fact it is in their best interest to say the exact opposite prior to the auction. Kind of like Verizon stating publicly that 2.5GHz was terrible for deploying LTE on, but telling the FCC it was great and would give Sprint too much advantage if the SoftBank/Sprint/Clearwire deal was approved."

It would HELP a lot, but it's not going to break their entire network to not have it, which i'm pretty sure is what he's saying here. The more B41 is deployed, the less people will require B26. That being said, it would really hurt rural customers to skimp on low band spectrum.  Fiercewireless is ridiculous. Posting ANYTHING about Sprint on that website is pretty much click bait."
Sprint,36i47h,mitten_mike,1 point,Tue May 19 15:55:52 2015 UTC,What's the point of sprint picking up 5x5 in another band. So that they can quad-band carrier aggregate? Sprint easily has the worst spectrum position of any carrier and 600Mhz isn't  going to fix it.
Sprint,36i47h,dsatrbs,0,Mon May 25 18:53:27 2015 UTC,"Sprint needs 600MHz... unless SoftBank is willing to pitch in significant capital to help Sprint sufficiently densify its current spectrum holdings.... 5x5 800MHz and 5x5 1900MHz can only do so much unless Sprint's 2.5GHz build is really dense... and even then, it might not be enough for saturated coverage."

It sucks that you were given misinformation, which is very likely since the plan was still relatively new six months ago.  The old unlimited plans ($150 for two lines) and every other plan Sprint offers (besides cut your bill in half) has discounts applied, so it could have been a simple misunderstanding by the store rep.  No idea why care was wrong so many times though.  Still, $100 for unlimited everything is better than any comparable plan the other carriers offer."

So, after apple confirmed that my phone is locked to sprint, I decided to finish getting my easy pay paid off. Then after several calls to sprint they were finally willing to unlock it.

Sprint,36dml2,cameradactyl,4,Mon May 18 15:33:59 2015 UTC,It depends on which device you have whether it can be unlocked. Check the chart on http://www.sprint.com/unlock to see if and what your devices are capable of. If it's domestic unlockable Care are the ones that can send the code.
Sprint,36dml2,t0rn4d0r3x,3,Mon May 18 16:34:14 2015 UTC,Sounds like you have old phones that are not eligible for the DSU.  Sell them as Sprint devices and re-buy T-Mobile devices.

Sprint,36dml2,YoungCorruption,8,Mon May 18 16:46:21 2015 UTC,I work in a corporate store. You cannot unlock it either. You can provide an MSL. That is NOT an unlock. Either the phone will be automatically unlocked when the terms are filled or CARE must send the unlock code. Please stop spreading false information like this.
Sprint,36dml2,t0rn4d0r3x,3,Mon May 18 16:56:48 2015 UTC,I have the MSL codes but what is CARE? I have paid off the bills and phones so from my understanding we have met the required conditions.
Sprint,36dml2,t0rn4d0r3x,4,Mon May 18 17:10:01 2015 UTC,Yeah the MSL code doesn't do anything. Care is customer care. If the phone supports it they are the ones that need to send the unlock information to the phone.

Sprint,369me7,whfsdude,3,Sun May 17 15:02:56 2015 UTC,"Sprint does not throttle in the traditional sense like T-Mobile. On unlimited phone plans there is network prioritization for top users, but only while a tower is congested.  I would guess as it gets closer to the network shutdown offers will be available. Sprint just recently sent letters to customers with old WiMax devices about offers for new devices, and when Nextel was shutdown there were offers for even flagship devices for $1. However, that was what Sprint did, as we know Clearwire is a different company and their consumer business was never great, they should have stayed wholesale."

On unlimited phone plans there is network prioritization for top users, but only while a tower is congested.   Right. Sprint doesn't offer unlimited plans for hotspot/data cards (which is understandable). I'm just really concerned about what would happen if you went over your cap (eg. software update). Verizon and AT&T both automatically start charging you overages.  Not having to worry about data overages is why I originally went with Clearwire."
Sprint,369me7,halcyoncmdr,3,Sun May 17 16:17:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah there would be automatic overage charges, that's the nature of a limited-use plan (ie a 5GB plan)."

Sprint,367s3t,DOPE_AS_FUCK_COOK,5,Sun May 17 06:31:58 2015 UTC,Your thought process is flawed.   Buy iPhone 6 on contract.  -$200  Pay off contract so iPhone 6 can be sold  -$350   Sell iPhone 6 for hopefully $550  (retail $650)  You have now gained nothing and are where you started.   Sprint also uses Sim cards.. Every carrier in the entire world does.
Sprint,367s3t,KurioHonoo,2,Sun May 17 01:05:45 2015 UTC,"Buy iPhone 6 on contract. -$200 Pay off contract so iPhone 6 can be sold -$350   why would i need to pay off the contract right away?    Sprint also uses Sim cards.. Every carrier in the entire world does.   this is news to me. i don't know why but i was under the impression the sim cards from sprint were dummy cards and your acct info was ""flashed"" to the phone. so i should just be able to remove my sim and sell the phone then transfer the sim to my new phone, correct?   thanks in advance"
Sprint,367s3t,myfapaccount_istaken,1 point,Sun May 17 03:44:00 2015 UTC,"CDMA phones like that of Sprint, Verizon, and Us Cellular use the CDMA network for voice/text/1x/3G,but they also have SIMs for their LTE networks.. So you could technically pop a Sprint Sim into a compatible phone, but you'd only get LTE and wouldn't be able to call or text anyone unless you got the phone properly activated."
Sprint,367s3t,DOPE_AS_FUCK_COOK,1 point,Sun May 17 04:29:29 2015 UTC,Prior to I phone 6 and any phone released before Feb 15th a sprint phone would only work on sprint {nexus aside). Now new phones will work on any carrier once unlocked. Unlocking will be done when contact is fulfilled or phone is paid off in full retail. Yes Sim cards on sprint are tied to the phone and the account and aren't swappable.  I have seen advancements in this with the new activation software that will provision the phone on your account automatically if you do it right. I put my my nexus card in another nexus and the sprint loader asked for my number and pin code and activated it.

Sprint,367s3t,KBOrtega,1 point,Sun May 17 08:23:34 2015 UTC,Before the iPhone 6 can be activated by whoever you sell it to the contract/installment/lease has to be fulfilled.. I paid $750 straight out for my Nexus 6 I can do whatever I want with it.. If I paid $200 subsidized pricing I either have to...   A.. Keep it for two years to complete contract so the phone can have a clean esn   Or.   B.. Buy out the contract so it can have a clean esn.

Sprint must be run by complete morons who don't understand that prepaid service MUST have BYOD. Why the hell would I want to be locked with a VM device that can't be used anywhere else. Nobody must be signing up since they had to increase the data alottlment. Also charging $5 per site for zero-rating social media is a slap in the face of every consumer.

FFS, Sprint has been lowering thier wholesale rates to rock-bottom prices so you have shit dealers like Freedompop haniding out free service."
Sprint,3634pl,B1GEast,1 point,Sat May 16 13:28:26 2015 UTC,"You'd be a fool to use Sprint on any prepaid brand   I don't think that's right. I use Sprint Prepaid, and I get 6GB of LTE data for $55. All of this data can be used with wifi hotspot for free. I'm limited by devices, but they have a few good devices, and they're all heavily subsidized. I can also voice roam on Verizon in areas with no coverage, and there is no activation fee.  MetroPCS BYOD policy is very limited. Cricket is not much cheaper, cannot roam, and has notably bad customer support.  I'm pointing all this out because the real problem I see with these Virgin plans is that they are not competitive with Sprint's own offerings, including Sprint Prepaid and Boost."
Sprint,3634pl,B1GEast,2,Sun May 17 01:47:54 2015 UTC,"You can get 10GB on Cricket (taxes included) for $55 and still tether without a problem. Plus, the freedom to bring your own device and double the coverage. Why would you need roaming when you use AT&T native network? You'll get LTE where Sprint doesn't even have a network. Roaming only exists in a few places like the Dakotas or Nevada. MetroPCS works exactly the same way, buy a sim and pop it into a phone. You're definitely paying for less service on Sprint Prepaid. FYI: You only get 50min of roaming on Sprint Prepaid."
Sprint,3634pl,mitten_mike,1 point,Sun May 17 16:55:28 2015 UTC,"You'll get LTE where Sprint doesn't even have a network   With a capped speed and higher ping.   Why would you need roaming when you use AT&T native network?   Because of rural travel. Verizon has much better rural coverage than AT&T, especially in the western US.   FYI: You only get 50min of roaming on Sprint Prepaid   Well aware. Plenty for rural driving a few times a month.   You're definitely paying for less service    No, because in my area Sprint Spark has data speeds of around 50mbps, with less than 50 ping. Which means that for 99% of my use, I'm getting far faster service than I would with cricket. I used AT&T for years, and Sprint tends to work a little better in my area for voice too.  Here's what I'm saying - there are reasons for someone to use a sprint provider. If you're in my situation, Sprint is clearly better than cricket. Having said that, for most people Cricket probably makes more sense. Especially compared with Boost's 10GB plan, which doesn't have roaming at all, so any traveling is going to be a nightmare. And the ability to use voice and data simultaneously is a must for some people, and not available with sprint spark lte. MetroPCS is a tougher sell - with no roaming and very limited t-mo coverage, traveling, again, will be a nightmare.   You'd be a fool to use Sprint on any prepaid brand   This is what I responded to. It's clearly not true - there are limited cases in which sprint prepaid or vm or whatever makes sense. But yes, Cricket is very competitive right now.  And I would almost make a different claim - that you'd be a fool to use Sprint on postpaid. Because of the activation fee, high device costs and inability to bring unlocked devices to or from the network. Even on postpaid, sprint caps roaming. And why would you give sprint (or any carrier) access to your credit? No postpaid providers really make sense - let alone sprint. Unlimited data doesn't seem to be a big enough benefit to counteract those drawbacks.  To each his own..."
Sprint,3634pl,B1GEast,1 point,Mon May 18 03:08:55 2015 UTC,"Wait, you'd give up nationwide LTE coverage for 50mins of Verizon roaming, that doesn't even make sense? If that level of coverage is important, you'd be better off on Verizon Prepaid ($60 gets you 5GB with the 3GB addon). As it stands right now, Cricket would still offer your better coverage. For every region you get ""50mbit"" of Spark you'll find three times as many places you get no service, so how is that even helpful? I know for a fact that if you are traveling to Verizon rural markets you have ZERO Sprint coverage 50-100 miles surrounding. Not only that, but prepaid lines have data compression and video compression, so you're not even getting the full web experience even with those rare speeds. Also, many roads and highways simply have no coverage on Sprint (or 3G only) and without nationwide 800LTE you have no in-building coverage. Then there is the problem of devices, Sprint Prepaid only has 5 or 6 really shitty phones available so you're forced to upgrade on their schedule. I understand you're trying to justify paying for Sprint Prepaid but your reasoning....well isn't reasonable."
Sprint,3634pl,B1GEast,1 point,Mon May 18 17:28:38 2015 UTC,"For every region you get ""50mbit"" of Spark you'll find three times as many places you get no service, so how is that even helpful?   What? Because it's in my area. My specific area is 50mbps. My area. In MY AREA sprint gets me 50mbps. That's about 6X faster than at&t in this area. 2X as fast as verizon. And about the same at t-mo, with lower ping and better voice.   you'll find three times as many places you get no service   Right. I'm not looking to get data in those areas. I need voice in rural areas. And fast data in my area. That's what i need.   Not only that, but prepaid lines have data compression and video compression, so you're not even getting the full web experience even with those rare speeds.   This just isn't true. Video is limited to 3g on all sprint lines. Aside from that, there is no compression.   $60 gets you 5GB with the 3GB addon   And this is laughably inaccurate. $60 gets you 2.5gb. Autopay gets you 3.5gb. Factoring in data add ons is not important, and makes the costs harder to compare.   I understand you're trying to justify paying for Sprint Prepaid but your reasoning....well isn't reasonable.   No. You made a blanket statement and are grappling to defend it. It was ridiculous to begin with, and you ought to just amend your original statement, or at least admit that there is nuance to this discussion.  It's perfectly reasonable: For 6GBs of fast data in my area, and voice coverage in the rural western us, Sprint is the best option. Verizon would be more expensive for less data. And cricket would be slower and have high ping."

Sprint,362h7g,sparkedman,2,Fri May 15 15:20:17 2015 UTC,"From Post:   ANN ARBOR, Mich. (BUSINESS WIRE), May 15, 2015 - Sprint today announced that its network in Ann Arbor, Michigan, received shared 1st place rankings for reliability, call and text performance, according to a new RootScore® Report by independent mobile analytics firm RootMetrics®.  Sprint shares the Call RootScore Award for the second consecutive test period in Ann Arbor. During this most recent test Sprint did not record any blocked calls. In 84 other markets measured in the first half of 2015, Sprint has been awarded a total of 117 first place (outright or shared) RootScore Awards for overall, reliability, speed, data, call, or text network performance.  “Our network gets better every day as we work to deliver the consistent reliability, capacity, and speed that our customers demand,” said Mike Santi, vice president of Sprint’s network in the North Region. “We’re pleased with these latest results for reliability, call and text, and we’re laser-focused on improving data speeds as we further invest in our Ann Arbor network.”     Gotta get that Band 41 deployed with backhaul ASAP. That Speed Index on the RootMetrics Report is painful to look at."
Sprint,362h7g,blaziecat1103,2,Fri May 15 15:23:50 2015 UTC,Sprint seems to have already deployed Band 41 in Ann Arbor without announcing it. Proof: https://i.imgur.com/X3kSmZu.jpg
Sprint,362h7g,mitten_mike,3,Fri May 15 17:43:04 2015 UTC,Thanks for sharing that. Perhaps the equipment is there but the backhaul isn't.
Sprint,362h7g,blaziecat1103,2,Fri May 15 17:55:20 2015 UTC,"Ann Arbor isn't a Spark city, just like Grand Rapids isn't, but there's a handful of B41 around."
Sprint,362h7g,maxsilver,2,Fri May 15 18:47:35 2015 UTC,"The backhaul definitely isn't there, or at least it wasn't when I last used my phone on the Sprint network."
Sprint,362h7g,maxsilver,2,Fri May 15 21:56:30 2015 UTC,"Sprint's still last place overall, and still far last place (by a wide 16 point margin) in data performance.  sigh   Maybe someday they'll fix their density in Michigan. Maybe someday..."
Sprint,362h7g,Reddog740,2,Fri May 15 15:28:36 2015 UTC,"It doesn't seem to be a density issue, or else the reliability/call/text scores wouldn't be as high as they are. IMHO, the data performance is what it is because there's no Band 41 deployed (per the coverage map) anywhere near Ann Arbor. Hopefully that's done by the next RootMetrics report."
Sprint,362h7g,Reddog740,2,Fri May 15 15:35:32 2015 UTC,"Band 41 plays a part, obviously. But density is still the biggest issue in most of Michigan. (See Flint's results - http://www.rootmetrics.com/us/rsr/flint-mi - Good call+text, bad data. This report's results were taken after B41 + Spark had been officially launched for the market)  Call/text scores can be perfect even in areas with low density, because calls/text can go over 2G. High scores in calls/text doesn't necessarily imply density is ok in a market."

You'd have to switch it online, hope it prompts you to add TEP, and then take it to a store. You'd basically be without a working phone for a couple of hours, and you'd be taking advantage of the system."
Sprint,361cxu,praemonitus_,2,Fri May 15 10:19:16 2015 UTC,"Taking advantage yes, morally questionable... But I would say it depends on you.  If you had TEP when you had it active in the past I would say regardless of the current situation you'd be in the right to have it replaced.  Realistically likely no retail employee would look at the activation date before exchanging it (they might have to order one as it is old, or they might replace it with another similar model depending on availability)."

Sprint,35yu67,sparkedman,6,Thu May 14 17:33:46 2015 UTC,Wonder why TMo can get the backhaul to these 2G sites but Sprint can't. :-(    They'd be a lot further a long if the backhaul was moving a long faster.
Sprint,35yu67,MrNagant,6,Thu May 14 20:47:08 2015 UTC,Microwave.  Microwave everywhere.   Sprint only recently started doing mass microwave backhaul orders.  The backhaul requirements for sprint sites are massive compared to tmobile especially in the requirement that they be able to sufficient backhaul 2 or 3 5x5 FDD carriers plus multiple 20 MHz TDD carriers.   In the more rural areas Sprint may be able to get away with daisy chaining sites and backhauling 100-200 mbps as these may stay dual band for a long time due to light load and almost no need for the expensive B41 equipment and capability. But again.   Sprint only recently (as in the last few months) began the massive microwave backhaul endeavours. Tmobile has been prepping MW BH for over a year.
Sprint,35yu67,lilotimz,2,Thu May 14 21:15:21 2015 UTC,"As far as backhaul with two carriers, Sprint has been halving the bandwidth here.  My market is fairly new 800MHz LTE.  Before, 20-30Mbps on PCS was easy in a lot of places.  In those same places I now get no more than 15Mbps on PCS or 800MHz.  :-P   Even the few B41 sites that exist don't have full backhaul.  :-P"
Sprint,35yu67,MrNagant,1 point,Thu May 14 23:25:02 2015 UTC,Ever heard of network congestion and load balancing?  Many moons ago one can easily get 50-70 Mbps on VZW band 13 then congestion happened and most people hardly get over 10 Mbps  unless xlte band 4 running 15/20 MHz FDD carriers are active.
Sprint,35yu67,lilotimz,0,Thu May 14 23:50:55 2015 UTC,This isn't congestion or load balancing. :-P
Sprint,35yu67,MrNagant,3,Fri May 15 00:05:24 2015 UTC,That’s what I would like to know.
Sprint,35yu67,abcgeek,5,Thu May 14 20:51:56 2015 UTC,We're talking strictly rural here. T-Mobile does not have fiber backhaul to their rural sites.
Sprint,35yu67,evan1123,3,Thu May 14 21:24:25 2015 UTC,"Planning on it but they never went through with it and never ordered high speed backhaul for the sites. Now they're adding backhaul just like Sprint had to, but the difference is they're using a lot more microwave which Sprint only started doing on a large scale recently."
Sprint,35yu67,evan1123,1 point,Thu May 14 23:00:25 2015 UTC,"Yes we all know of Sprint's backhaul ordering failures by ordering it ""just in time"" in order to save money.  It came back to bite them.  T-Mobile did much better on the backhaul ordering front for their EDGE+LTE sites and they are also utilizing lots of microwave which Sprint did not see as a good option during network vision (a failure by the old network team).  Sprint's NV rip and replace is already substantially complete.  Most of the remaining 3G only sites are just waiting for backhaul.  They equal T-Mobile on the LTE pops coverage front.  They aren't really working on converting to LTE anymore, they're working on adding the capacity layer."
Sprint,35yu67,evan1123,2,Fri May 15 02:39:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, 2G -> LTE sites here.    Sprint sites are already LTE capable (base stations and antennas), just there is no backhaul, thus LTE isn't turned on."
Sprint,35yu67,MrNagant,2,Fri May 15 02:58:57 2015 UTC,"Sprint backhaul for B25+CDMA was initially provisioned at 40Mbit/s per sector.  Early in the band 41 deployment process the backhaul scaling was slow, but now it seems that they've caught up with deployment pace and backhaul provisioning isn't lagging far behind equipment.  Regardless, having B41 active takes congestion off of the B25 airlink, which saturates much faster than the backhaul does.  Sprint is going to be actively expanding coverage along with the densification plan.  They have license buildout deadlines to meet in Montana, and we already know that expansion is funded.  The rest of the expansion plan is mostly speculation, but they will be adding native coverage in some aspect."
Sprint,35yu67,evan1123,0,Fri May 15 03:02:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and Sprint has the equipment already in place in most of these areas.  They just need the backhaul.  TMo has to go back and install new antennas, but shoot, they got LTE online.   I wonder what kind of backhaul these 3G sites have.  What, 3~12Mbps?  I'd rather them get LTE turned on, see about increasing current backhaul seepds.  Otherwise just deal with the existing bandwidth of the existing backhaul.  A lot of the remaining areas are rural, stretches of freeways and highways so not like load is going to be massive."
Sprint,35yu67,MrNagant,3,Fri May 15 03:05:34 2015 UTC,"I wonder what kind of backhaul these 3G sites have.  What, 3~12Mbps?  I'd rather them get LTE turned on, see about increasing current backhaul seepds.  Otherwise just deal with the existing bandwidth of the existing backhaul.   Sprint tried that with temporary backhaul upgrades that didn't meet the standard requirements of Network Vision. It resulted in even more customer backlash due to the extremely slow LTE speeds versus a total lack of LTE at all."

Sprint,35yu67,MrNagant,0,Fri May 15 03:13:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  Sprint is using what, three or four difference vendors.  As far as backhaul goes to sites that are LTE ready, they all are weak.  I'd figure weak overhaul handling.  Sprint has had just as much time basically as TMo to get proper backhual to these areas.   If it wasn't for this spotty TMo coverage zone I live in... :-P"
Sprint,35yu67,tomsloane,0,Thu May 14 20:56:25 2015 UTC,"Hopefully, it'll be handled better for the next phases of Sprint's buildout strategy that was discussed at this meeting..."
Sprint,35yu67,halcyoncmdr,3,Thu May 14 21:36:50 2015 UTC,"From Article:   T-Mobile US (NYSE:TMUS) now covers 280 million POPs with LTE, according to CTO Neville Ray. The carrier had pledged to reach that coverage goal by the middle of this year, and thus appears to have reached that goal earlier than expected.   According to T-Mobile executives, the company's LTE coverage expansion will eventually increase the number of markets where the carrier can operate a retail business--thus putting T-Mobile on firmer competitive footing with the likes of Verizon Wireless (NYSE: VZ) and AT&T Mobility (NYSE: T).  Ray, speaking during an appearance at the MoffettNathanson Media & Communications Summit, noted that the company's goal is still to cover 300 million POPs with LTE by year-end, which he said will let T-Mobile ""take competition into more and more key areas of the U.S.""  ....  Verizon and AT&T claim they now cover 308 million POPs with LTE. Sprint's (NYSE: S) LTE network now covers 280 million POPs.   Get a move on, Sprint.... Hopefully Marcelo comes back from his ""Big Boss"" meeting with a plan to execute a competitive buildout strategy."

On April 5th, Sprint announced it had deployed a Triband DAS at Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City (Royals), just in time for opening day on April 6th.  Some posters in this sub have commented on substantial speed/coverage improvements as a result.  Sprint needs to keep doing these kinds of deployments, especially with RootMetrics tracking them."

Calls that originate on the AIRAVE will automatically try to transfer to the Sprint network if a strong signal is available. Transfer is not guaranteed depending on network availability, signal strength and interference.  Does a wireless call that starts outside of the AIRAVE coverage area transfer to the AIRAVE when the user enters the coverage area?  No. Calls that are initiated on the Sprint network will continue there, even though you may be within the AIRAVE coverage area.   According to the FAQ, your iPhone would not switch over to the AIRAVE with a call in session.    On a side note, check out Sprint's new WiFi Connect Router which is optimized for Sprint's WiFi Calling feature. WiFi Calling is now supported on iPhone 5s/5c/6/6+ and Android handsets (except for Nexus Devices).  Worth noting:   Will Wi-Fi Calling support in-call handover between Wi-Fi and wireless networks?  No. An active call will disconnect if a caller moves from Wi-Fi coverage to a cellular network . The same will happen if moving between Wi-Fi networks. If the call disconnects, you will have to redial.  Does Wi-Fi Calling Support Messaging (SMS & MMS)?  For Android devices, messaging is supported in Wi-Fi Calling mode even if there is not any coverage from the Nationwide Sprint Network.  For iOS devices, messaging is still handled by the Nationwide Sprint Network. If you do not have coverage then messaging services are not supported. This functionality is expected to be supported over Wi-Fi in the future. iMessage on iOS is supported over Wi-Fi."

Sprint,35y6mw,sparkedman,2,Thu May 14 14:30:42 2015 UTC,"Boingo Wireless is still in the early days of rolling out carrier Wi-Fi offloading with Sprint (NYSE: S), but its Wi-Fi technology is on about 10 million handsets today, growing to 40 million, including some of Sprint's other brands like Virgin Mobile.  At the Jefferies TMT 2015 conference, Boingo CEO David Hagan reiterated that Boingo is working with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) to get Passpoint certified on their handsets. Right now with Sprint, it's only on Android, and Apple represents about 12 million of its handsets, so once it gets Apple certified, ""that'll launch that 12 million handsets, so lots of operational and engineering work going on right now with the carriers.""   .....   He also noted the anticipation leading up to its first real carrier Wi-Fi offload deal with Sprint. When a Sprint customer walks into a Boingo hotspot, ""a little magic sauce"" on the handset automatically connects it to the Wi-Fi network, and everything they do from a data perspective then goes over Wi-Fi and Sprint pays Boingo on a per-megabyte basis. ""So true offload, meaning the customer doesn't have to do anything,"" he said."

I hope this Boingo arrangement is just a stop-gap. It's not like Sprint is getting free usage of the network. Sprint is paying Boingo on a per-megabyte basis.  It's ridiculous how Marcelo can complain about writing multi-million dollar roaming checks to other carriers, yet somehow a deal with Boingo in which Sprint still has to pay on a per-megabyte basis is an accomplishment.  See: Article   ""I can't disclose how much I pay for roaming,"" he said. ""But it's insane.""  ....  ""I don't like writing checks for hundreds of millions of dollars to my two biggest competitors,"" he said. ""I'd rather write those checks to rural carriers.""   Something I'm missing here?

Sprint is giving away eight G4 units, and the listing says that the retail value of the device is approximately $600. T-Mobile, on the other hand, is giving away 7 G4 units over a period of 7 weeks, and also lists the $600 price point.

Sprint,35vi2z,storyquest101,4,Wed May 13 21:21:56 2015 UTC,Was the purchase at a 3rd party store or a corporate store
Sprint,35vi2z,myfapaccount_istaken,2,Wed May 13 21:54:53 2015 UTC,"At a corporate store. Here's the other weird thing. I've been looking through the paperwork that I have saved, and they definitely messed some things up.  First of all, I had gotten a LG G2 as my new phone. I have a contract for that-- the 2 year, monthly payment contract.  However, I also have a contract for the new Framily plan that I had joined, and on that, they say that I purchased an Iphone 4s (which is the old phone that I got rid of when I got the G2). They basically associated the plan change/new phone with an incorrect phone from what I can tell.. don't know if that might have anything to do with it. The actual contract never acknowledges the actual phone I was using."
Sprint,35vi2z,myfapaccount_istaken,2,Thu May 14 15:29:18 2015 UTC,"Oh, also, when this first happened in the very beginning, they sent me these charges saying that they were only because I had never returned my phone. Which I had, and I went into the store AND called with my receipt to prove it. Within a week, they suddenly changed what the bill was listed as, instead of charging me for a unpaid phone, it was then listed as a cancelled contract."
Sprint,35vi2z,Photojared,2,Thu May 14 15:33:36 2015 UTC,"So since it was a corp store. Account Services (or whatever they are called now) should be able to see that you returned the phone in eh 14 days. They should be able to reverse any charges above and beyond what you would have owed with your previous contract (20 month upgrades/ v 2 year Contracts) Service for the time active is valid, so are upgrade fees and activation, also when you port there is no credit for unused portion of time in your bill cycle."
Sprint,35vi2z,t0rn4d0r3x,3,Thu May 14 16:23:23 2015 UTC,Upgrade date /= contract end date. Sounds like that's the case. You canceled before your contract was up.
Sprint,35vi2z,t0rn4d0r3x,1 point,Thu May 14 03:26:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as I said in a comment below, I did cancel before my original contract was up, I understood that. But they charged me for a full 2 year contract which I did not have/or at least had cancelled before I was required to keep it. I only had 6 months left on my actual contract. Getting charged $450 for that seems ridiculous."
Sprint,35vi2z,zookkz,1 point,Thu May 14 15:31:06 2015 UTC,"First off NEVER simply ignore a debt. Even if you ""know it's not right"" get it fixed as soon as possible. This is something that most likely could have been fixed by the store with a simple phone call and 15 minutes of your time. Now it's WAY past that.  You can try going back to the store but you're most likely going to have to get in touch with billing. I'm not sure what will happen if it's already been sent to collections (rather than just a sort of ""final warning"" before it gets sent). Your best bet though is to escalate through billing. They should be able to see the returns and everything but it might take a while to get fixed as it will have to be escalated to someone who is authorized to give that amount of credits."
Sprint,35vi2z,zookkz,1 point,Thu May 14 02:58:32 2015 UTC,"I did try to fix it. I went to the store 2 times. Both times they told me they ""would take care of it."" I called 5 times. 3 times no one knew what I was talking about, 2 times I went up to a manager and they said they would handle it. Then they just did nothing, never told me, stop sending me notifications and I assumed it was taken care of, until somewhere else started contacting me."
Sprint,35vi2z,antecglue,1 point,Thu May 14 15:25:37 2015 UTC,Oh wow that's really messed up. Especially if this was a corporate store. Like I said from how you made it sound it should have been a 10 minute fix.

Sprint,35u5qw,shidokanartist,3,Wed May 13 15:14:11 2015 UTC,"I'm friends with the rep at the Sprint store, and near the final process he pulled me off to the side and said that while it's frowned upon by Sprint, I can technically turn in any working phone in good condition.   I'd be careful here, and comply with the directions. Not sure your friend, as a Sprint rep, should be telling you to do this.  See: Buyout Info   The phone you turn in must be the last phone you used with your prior carrier and be the phone tied to the bill that you are uploading for this Reward Card. If you do not turn in your last competitor phone, you will be charged back up to the amount of the Reward Card you received."
Sprint,35u5qw,sparkedman,3,Wed May 13 15:16:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this seems like the safer bet. I don't want any problems, especially since the account isn't in my name. Thank you."

Sprint,35u5qw,sparkedman,2,Wed May 13 15:54:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks, my service has been great so far, it's been every bit as good as my AT&T service was. My only gripe is that after I paid a $50 down payment for a Galaxy S6, I didn't care for it and returned it for an iPhone, and then had to pay $225 down because the $50 was a promo they could run from porting my number over and it couldn't be done again or something. Either way, I'm still paying the same in the end, just wasn't expecting that kind of difference in down payment."

Sprint,35ssfp,zakats,3,Wed May 13 05:12:41 2015 UTC,800SMR holdings are a mess. Specmap is not a reliable source for 800SMR holdings or BRS/EBS holdings. What location are your looking at?
Sprint,35ssfp,evan1123,2,Wed May 13 06:41:25 2015 UTC,"No particular area, I'm mostly just curious as to what Sprint's sub-ghz spectrum situation is like nationwide."
Sprint,35ssfp,evan1123,6,Wed May 13 07:08:26 2015 UTC,"Well unfortunately there is no public reliable source of spectrum holdings in 800SMR unless you manually search the license database by BEA.  Sprint has enough 800SMR nationwide for at least 1 CDMA1x carrier (1.25x1.25MHz). Majority of the nation has enough holdings for 5x5MHz LTE in addition to the 1x carrier. Some areas have room for a 2nd CDMA1x carrier, and some only have room for CDMA with no possibility of LTE.  For the most part, Sprint has no less than 6x6MHz of 800SMR nationwide. There are a few areas with 5x5MHz, but the majority of the US has 7.5x7.5MHz to 8x8MHz of available SMR spectrum."
Sprint,35ssfp,danrant,3,Wed May 13 07:25:58 2015 UTC,"The FCC report and order from 2004 says on page 9:  We designate fourteen megahertz in the upper portion of the 800 MHz band (817-824 MHz/862-869 MHz) for ESMR systems... As part of band reconfiguration, we require Nextel to relinquish all of its 800 MHz band spectrum holdings below 817 MHz/862 MHz.  Another more recent 2014 report and order reiterates on page 58:  going forward, we find only 14 megahertz of SMR spectrum is suitable and available for the provision of mobile telephony/mobile broadband services and will be included in the screen  So while Sprint still holds some licenses that cover more than 7x7 MHz combined the 2004 FCC order overwrites that and makes only 7x7 MHz available for commercial cellular network deployment.  P.S. I was doing some research recently to display more data on Spectrum Gateway."
Sprint,35ssfp,lilotimz,2,Wed May 13 17:45:31 2015 UTC,To get 7.5-8 mhz you have to take into account the guard bands between sprint spectrum and those allocated to PS. If no one moves into the guard band then Sprint is allowed to use it. If someone moves into it then nope.
Sprint,35ssfp,danrant,2,Wed May 13 22:51:26 2015 UTC,Was that stated in some other order/waiver/extension? Because the 2004 order clearly requires Nextel to relinquish all spectrum holdings below 817 MHz.
Sprint,35ssfp,lilotimz,3,Wed May 13 23:05:57 2015 UTC,It's one of the recent orders.  You'll have to ask Robert of s4gru for the specific one.  He has his own map of the smr spectrum allocations with information he acquired over the years.
Sprint,35ssfp,abcgeek,2,Wed May 13 23:21:00 2015 UTC,I’m kind of curious on this myself.
Sprint,35ssfp,stylz168,2,Wed May 13 07:24:36 2015 UTC,"In simple terms, the vast majority of Sprint's holdings in 800SMR is enough to deploy one 1.25mhz voice carrier for 1xAdvanced voice, and one 5mhz LTE carrier for data.  The IBEZ markets are limited to just 1xA I believe."
Sprint,35ssfp,evan1123,2,Wed May 13 15:02:48 2015 UTC,"ugh, yuck.   So let me get this right: Sprint will have LTE in 5x5 L800/SMR, usually 5x5 in upper PCS (bigger chunks of PCS scattered around), and a ton of BRS spectrum? Then the PCS and SMR for legacy voice support?  (attn /u/danrant, /u/evan1123, /u/abcgeek)"
Sprint,35ssfp,stylz168,3,Wed May 13 21:14:37 2015 UTC,"LTE 5x5MHz in SMR for the majority of the US. Along the border with Mexico they will be limited to a 3x3MHz carrier once rebanding is complete.  Sprint is actively refarming more PCS CDMA for LTE in many markets to add a second 5x5MHz LTE carrier.   As far as BRS/EBS, Sprint has a single 20MHz TDD carrier deployed and are currently adding a 2nd 20MHz TDD carrier. Eventually they will have 3 20MHz TDD carriers in band 41, but we have no knowledge of plans beyond that."
Sprint,35ssfp,nishcheta,2,Wed May 13 21:29:58 2015 UTC,"I'll use my market for example (NYC)  Sprint has 5x5 LTE deployed on B26 (800SMR), 5x5 LTE deployed on B25 (1900 G-Block), and 20mhz of TDD LTE deployed on B41 (2500mhz). They have enough free PCS spectrum to deploy another LTE carrier, which is 5x5, as well as enough spectrum in EBS/BRS for an additional 2 20mhz carriers.  All voice traffic can be carried on the 1xAdvanced 800mhz carrier (4 times the capacity on a single channel), as well as legacy 1x voice on PCS. One of the reasons why Sprint is winning so many reliability awards on RootMetrics is because 800mhz voice penetration is amazing, and really helps fill gaps where users may have dropped calls or had no service in the past."
Sprint,35ssfp,stylz168,2,Wed May 13 21:25:39 2015 UTC,I don't know if I'd characterize the 1x as 'amazing' but it's certainly better than the old PCS voice.
Sprint,35ssfp,danrant,1 point,Thu May 14 00:14:06 2015 UTC,"1xAdvanced lets you get the extra voice capacity, and lets you make calls where you couldn't before.  Also, both 1xA and PCS voice has HD voice."
Sprint,35ssfp,evan1123,2,Thu May 14 01:57:49 2015 UTC,Right. They also lease a lot of EBS long term.
Sprint,35ssfp,stylz168,2,Wed May 13 21:32:24 2015 UTC,Once rebanding is finished along the borders Sprint will be able to deploy a single 1xA carrier and a 3x3MHz LTE carrier.
Sprint,35ssfp,lilotimz,1 point,Wed May 13 21:26:10 2015 UTC,"Yep, and the 3x3 is really used only for inbuilding, gap coverage rather than capacity."
Sprint,35ssfp,danrant,2,Wed May 13 22:20:03 2015 UTC,It will be used for capacity to a certain threshold where they will start rejecting connections based probably on priority or other set parameters.

The discount will only apply to DATA only per line. I was talking to a rep a few weeks back about switching to the 60 unlimited and only to find out my discount will be a lot less compared to my old everything 1500 plan.

Your paying $50 a line so that's good and any additional line I add only pays $40. Hey it's UNLIMITED DATA.
