Shurima,3bpdam,PhreakMarryMe,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:14:27 2015 UTC,"Passive made to sustain any poke in lane  Q made to scale into a late game monster  W made to deny any type of duel or chance to fight. 5 second point and click stun. #counterplay  E made to deny even more any type of duel with an aoe percentage armor shred. AOE. LIKE, WHY.  R made to make him even more tanky to make sure you can't fight him after 20 minutes.  A champ that scales INFINATELY just by doing what you are suposed to do which is farm, in a meta where games are long because tanks can't be built in 15 minutes, I think it's safe to say he is, indeed, overpowered.   He does have a weak early game, but he can never fall really that back unless you 3 man towerdive him every 5 minutes, which makes dragon and towers really easy for their team. Plus, he is really good at setting up ganks just by pressing a point and click 99% slow, so pushing him undertower to deny farm has the effect of being really exposed to ganks (and don't you dare give me the ""just ward"" bullshit).   So you have 2 options, freeze the lane and let him stack while you wait for your jungler/mid or both to come kill him (if you can, cause he withers one and renders him pretty much useless) or push him undertower and be really exposed to ganks, and even wards won't save you.  So basically, your statement wasn't wrong. His whole kit is indeed involved in the last hitting. If by that you mean you can't do SHIT to deny his last hitting safely."

If your fool is at 30% hp or even less, you can all in him by Q-ing threw and following up with your E so your fool will get knocked up and you get a shield.

But in all seriousness, you have to get better at micro-managing in LoL to even figure out how to play him at the basics. A friend of mine who just started ranked but has only 6 months of experience tried to play Azir after I carried one of our duo normal game. He doesn't have the micro skills in the game developed enough and complains that the champ is too hard. Play the game more and practice last hitting, paying attending to the mini map, choosing better judgements for every scenario, and work on positioning during team fights. This will help your league skills greatly and will passively improve your playing ability with not only Azir but other champs too."

Shurima,3blk83,Cavalarrr,-1,Thu Jul 2 00:49:16 2015 UTC,"Farm in lane and use sand soldiers to harass any other midlaners from safe range, buy Grail vs any ap heavy burst champs such as lb, fizz, ekko, if not then buy morellos into nashors, once you have 40% CDR consider that your signal to start wrecking shit, always look for situations where you can attack from range, preferably behind your frontline and over walls or terrain, never blow E to get a kill, save it because Azir is prone to getting bursted once someone gets in his face.  You need to have E always up so you can emergency W>E or Q>W>E for the max range escape, and look for potential situations where you can force the enemys backline into your team with a quick W>Q>E>R, but if you go too hard prepare to get blown up as focus switches to you, assuming you hit a good R their squishies should be perfectly placed into the waiting hands of your frontline and carries.
