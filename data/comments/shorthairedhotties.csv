shorthairedhotties,3dt3h2,MadMaxx82,-1,Sun Jul 19 16:02:39 2015 UTC,Because not everyone has to follow what you find attractive?
shorthairedhotties,3dt3h2,iwantmymuffin,2,Sun Jul 19 18:10:08 2015 UTC,Wasn't meant as an insult. But since we are talking about hotness and beauties here I think I am allowed to tell my opinion
shorthairedhotties,3dt3h2,MadMaxx82,-2,Sun Jul 19 18:27:22 2015 UTC,"I mean just because you can say your opinion, does not mean you should? No one cares what you have to say about what you don't like about a persons appearance.

shorthairedhotties,3dt3h2,iwantmymuffin,3,Sun Jul 19 18:34:53 2015 UTC,So everything in this sub has to be seen as exclusively positive?

shorthairedhotties,3dotht,maschine01,10,Sat Jul 18 01:23:12 2015 UTC,I guess you're not aware of this but getting a job as a flight attendant is based a lot off of looks. It also has to do with customer service but if you don't look right you don't get hired. All I want to know is what I can do to make my hair look more professional since it's in a weird growing out phase.

You have what looks to be a slender face and your facial features are pretty as well. My hair stylist told me when I voiced my concerns that if you enjoy your face, cut your hair off. My advice is cut it. At the end of the day hair is hair...and if you are confident you can pretty well rock anything. And if you change your mind, grow it out. Beware though...I thought my first cut was short but I soon fell in love and now I can't stop cutting it :-P I don't think I'll ever have long hair again"

shorthairedhotties,3dgt72,Vegas420,4,Thu Jul 16 04:20:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly, probably just wait a few days. I think it's a little too short on the sides, but honestly even a few mm will make a huge difference at that length.

shorthairedhotties,3ddicu,feminist--killjoy,3,Wed Jul 15 18:46:56 2015 UTC,"2 (1/4"")!"
shorthairedhotties,3ddicu,AvecFromage,2,Wed Jul 15 19:07:57 2015 UTC,Best thing about a shaved head is the feel. Especially the pricklyness of a 0. And showers. Definitely showers.

shorthairedhotties,3ddicu,Vegas420,2,Thu Jul 16 23:22:13 2015 UTC,"Might keep it buzzed for a while, probably won't let it grow out more than 1/4 in or so for the time being. I like it a lot! My family doesn't though but whatever, I let my haters be my motivators 👍🏽"

shorthairedhotties,3dbguq,nomadthoughts,7,Wed Jul 15 06:42:52 2015 UTC,I would recommend shaving the sides or one side and keeping the top somewhat long. You have that kind of face :)
shorthairedhotties,3dbguq,nomadthoughts,6,Wed Jul 15 01:50:29 2015 UTC,I'm really feeling this tbh I could have a lot of fun with that

shorthairedhotties,3dbguq,Painkiller3666,2,Wed Jul 15 12:30:01 2015 UTC,Shaving the sides was my first thought as well. I think it would suit you

shorthairedhotties,3dbguq,spriggig,3,Wed Jul 15 06:44:39 2015 UTC,Super short on the sides and back. I think keeping the bangs would be excellent.
shorthairedhotties,3dbguq,epicureanmanslut,2,Wed Jul 15 05:15:16 2015 UTC,Tbh my bangs are a part of my soul I couldn't get rid of them
shorthairedhotties,3dbguq,shavemebald,2,Wed Jul 15 06:45:08 2015 UTC,That beautiful face would look great with a super short pixie!

shorthairedhotties,3d1feu,sorrynevermind,27,Sun Jul 12 19:00:33 2015 UTC,"I would retake it with the focus properly set on you before submitting it, right now you're slightly fuzzy."
shorthairedhotties,3d1feu,Desembler,5,Sun Jul 12 20:06:02 2015 UTC,Yeah I noticed that too :/ must have put my finger in front of the focusing light when I was getting it set up I'm probably going to do another round of photos before actually submitting anything (I've got until the first of August).
shorthairedhotties,3d1feu,jayman419,18,Sun Jul 12 20:29:54 2015 UTC,"Aside from the quality issues with the setup already mentioned, the pose itself is alright.  Depending on the type of job your submitting for, you may want to consider taking the shot without your shoes. The rest of your outfit is nice, and showing a bit of midriff gives some data on your belly without making it look like you're trying too hard. It's also tight enough to reveal a bit about the shape of your breasts, which will be a factor if you're modeling in any way... not just SG or one of those places.  It's nice that you've got most of your thigh exposed, it shows that your legs are in decent shape without an overabundance of cellulite. The same is true of your calves, very shapely and useful for a lot of different styles and shots.  Your right arm is in a good pose, it offers a good bit of information about the condition of your shoulder and your upper arm, and it's also pretty plain that you have very shapely forearms as well.  Your left arm... first off that just looks somewhat uncomfortable. I think it might look better, and be a bit less distracting, if you just let it dangle along the chair leg.   Don't get me wrong, it's still useful from the point of view of judging the kind of modeling that you could pose for, because it shows the back of your hand (which are like tree rings for women).   But you could accomplish the same thing if it was simply resting on your leg, and that'd also show a bit more of the front side of that forearm, which would compliment the information given about your other hand, as well as drawing attention back to your somewhat spectacular thighs.  All in all, I'd rate the picture (not you personally) as about a 5 or 6 out or 10. There's good data in there, and as part of a larger set it'd be useful for making a decision. But as a lead-off shot there are some things you could do differently to get any potential photographers/agencies to feel more inclined to look through the rest of your portfolio.  Your expression... I'd like to see a bit of a smile, a bit of your teeth. Mainly just to make sure that they're in alright shape, you don't have to grin like Harley Quinn or anything.   The eyes, the hair, the hat (and to mention your outfit choice a second time), you've got a decent sense of personal style so if this is the kind of job where you'll be doing a lot of picking your own wardrobe there's no red flags there. I also like that you didn't go too heavy on the makeup (though I'm assuming it's an airquote no-makeup look rather than an actual lack)... still lets them know that your face doesn't need a lot of spackle to look attractive.  You personally I'd rate, just on this shot, in the 7s with plenty of easy options to increase your integer."
shorthairedhotties,3d1feu,jayman419,3,Sun Jul 12 21:18:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm never really super sure what to do with my arms, have to do more practising in the mirror haha. I really appreciate all the advice! The open call in question is more of a contest that American Apparel is running and it looks like it's for a one off photo shoot (with some money to the store as an added bonus I guess). I'm not really sure if contestants are rated on a single photo or multiple since the wording in the terms and conditions is a little unclear. I plan to do a couple more shoots so I have more options. Also I'm not wearing makeup in this shot, so the skin thing may just be a trick of the focus/light. Do you think it would be better to wear makeup? I kind of avoided it this time since I'm not very good with makeup."
shorthairedhotties,3d1feu,twopatties,3,Sun Jul 12 22:06:49 2015 UTC,"I think you have very nice skin. It wasn't a trick of the light, simply surprise to find it was an honestly bare shot... most women at least need some kind of base/foundation to get the kind of clean and even  tone you seem to have naturally.   Your eyes aren't particularly puffy, you have a cute pert little nose, and your lips are very nice too. A smile would help, show off those teeth. But I think if they need you in makeup for the shoot, they'll have someone to do it, and posing barefaced makes it easier for them to know what they're working with.  As someone else mentioned, since it's for AA you might be better off with a more standard (read: boring) set of poses. Full front shot in a yoga outfit or something that will reveal your figure but wouldn't be considered particularly suggestive, and sandals instead of bare feet (footwear that's revealing enough that they can see the kind of outfit choices you'll enable them to use).  Personally (and without reading the terms of the contest), I don't think you'd necessarily wash out for going for the lounging look you're presenting here, all that key information they need is present, and it does have a certain level of charm that a standard portrait might be lacking.   But for a corporate shoot, even if you stick with this pose, I'd still change my advice to sandals over bare feet. Don't get me wrong, those are pretty cool shoes. But they hide a lot, and letting the photographers see your feet tells them what sort of outfits you enable them to use. Bare feet are still an option (especially if you don't have light, strappy summer-y sandals to wear) but there's a lot to be said, in a corporate environment, for something suggestive yet not blatantly revealing.  What you did with your arms wasn't horrible. No reason to feel to bad about that... I wouldn't have guessed that you're particularly inexperienced. It did present most of the key information that a photographer would need. Just, as I was suggesting, bring that other arm into play.   Draping one behind your head was nice, use your other arm to highlight some other part of your body (like I said, resting it on your thigh would work I think).  But you might be better off with a boring shot like people use to show off their weight-loss accomplishments. Sure, it'll look like a hundred other submissions, but you can put front and side shots together in a single image file (depending on how they want the submissions) and offer the key data they need at a glance."
shorthairedhotties,3d1feu,bnhfckr,12,Sun Jul 12 23:04:23 2015 UTC,You certainly have the features. But I would consider a more professional shoot. That can cost you $0 once you find similar talents working on their portfolios too. They would take it much more seriously as they have hundreds if not thousands of submissions regularly.
shorthairedhotties,3d1feu,onmyhonor,3,Sun Jul 12 21:04:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah what this guy said.  I know a few people hoping to get into photography/just with an interest in it as a hobby who are always looking for models too, I'm sure OP can find one of these!"
shorthairedhotties,3d1feu,Failed_Condom,3,Sun Jul 12 21:19:52 2015 UTC,"It might help to clear up some things if I mention that this is for an open model call/contest sort of thing through American Apparel. The options were to go to the closest AA store to have your photo taken, submit through instagram, or write an essay and send it in (buried in the terms and conditions so I'm not sure how many people saw that). I wasn't able to get to NYC and from what I'm seeing not everyone who went today even got their photos done. They don't really have any guidelines on what they want in the photos and the tag on instagram hasn't been to informative either :/ It looks like the in store photographs are just full body shots against a wall, so I'm debating whether to just try to replicate that (with a friend doing the photography instead of me fiddling with the self timer)."
shorthairedhotties,3d1feu,Synerra,6,Sun Jul 12 21:53:15 2015 UTC,"Cute pic, totally wrong for a modeling application. You should absolutely take a plain, straight on, full body, high quality picture. If you can submit more than one, do another that is shoulders up. Since it is for AA I'd wear either something very basic, or a bikini. No accessories. Little to no make up. Good luck!"

shorthairedhotties,3d1feu,SamePotato,2,Mon Jul 13 02:18:40 2015 UTC,Have you considered toning your hair? It looks quite brassy (yellowish). I think a more neutral medium blonde would look fantastic with your skin.
shorthairedhotties,3d1feu,SamePotato,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:42:13 2015 UTC,I haven't done anything with it in a while since the last time I had it dyed my hair was kinda damaged. I'll have to see if I can find the box dye I like in the right colour.
shorthairedhotties,3d1feu,Secondsemblance,2,Mon Jul 13 02:22:18 2015 UTC,"If your roots aren't too bad yet (can't tell from the photo) I'd suggest just going over this with a purple-based (ash) toner and low volume developer (10 vol). It'll be much gentler than a box dye and it won't change the level or lift; it only changes the tone to eliminate the yellow. It will cost about the same as a boxed dye but you'll have much more control over the results with less damage.   If you have a Sally's Beauty Supply nearby, go in and ask them what they'd recommend. Or post on /r/fancyfollicles and ask for toner recs."

shorthairedhotties,3cat3j,robertpr,4,Mon Jul 6 14:50:04 2015 UTC,My skin is on fire haha
shorthairedhotties,3cat3j,sochac,3,Mon Jul 6 15:01:29 2015 UTC,Your hair looks awesome. Hope you had a fun trip to the beach (besides getting a bit burnt).
shorthairedhotties,3cat3j,sochac,2,Mon Jul 6 13:35:53 2015 UTC,It was amazing! It was my first time ever seeing the beach or the ocean and it was breathtaking. The jellyfish stings were not though :(
shorthairedhotties,3cat3j,sochac,3,Mon Jul 6 14:54:07 2015 UTC,ouch lol Glad you had a blast. May i ask where (state/country) etc. you went to the beach at (just curious as over here (U.S.) along the coastline the beaches vary so much state to state)?
shorthairedhotties,3cat3j,sochac,2,Mon Jul 6 14:58:25 2015 UTC,I went to Gulf Shores and am excited to see as many beaches as I can in my lifetime
shorthairedhotties,3cat3j,sochac,3,Mon Jul 6 14:59:23 2015 UTC,Very nice. I'm up in Jersey and have gone to just about all along the East Coast (still waiting for my chance to get up to Maine area).   Though for the holidays I tend go in the opposite direction (always so crowded around here).
shorthairedhotties,3cat3j,awesomo_prime,2,Mon Jul 6 15:03:12 2015 UTC,What are the beaches like there?
shorthairedhotties,3cat3j,ChiangRai,3,Mon Jul 6 15:09:11 2015 UTC,"Some of our beaches are quite nice, i.e. (areas like Cape May at the way bottom of the state). It varies quite from nice Sandy beaches to areas which are more on the side of boardwalks/rides, etc. Its a combo of more natural areas/beaches (some are state parks) which are also the ones I prefer b/c I like to be away from people and see the wildlife more). The water up here is a bit colder (and darker) than down in Florida and we have some nice sized waves if you want to surf a bit as well.  Though not in my direct area (down in Maryland is Assateague Island) and that is a fun experience in itself). They have wild horses on the island and they wander along the beachline. Quite interesting and a very nice area."
shorthairedhotties,3cat3j,ChiangRai,2,Mon Jul 6 15:21:50 2015 UTC,"....horses?I turn into a giddy child when I see horses, so seeing wild ones on the beach would make. my. life."
shorthairedhotties,3cat3j,Intheshadowsalways,3,Mon Jul 6 15:24:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, quite a few too. At first it was a bit weird b/c you go on the beach and the horses are just walking along or standing there. It's quite cool.   If I get the chance later I'll see what pics I have on my computer at home and put a few up on my Flickr (ill send you the link). Pretty sure I got some of the horses along the shoreline."

shorthairedhotties,3buqtb,DemomanTakesSkill,21,Thu Jul 2 08:54:24 2015 UTC,"Personally, my favorite point of attack is a girl's neck. So just seeing it, knowing it can't be hidden, does something for me. And ears can be just so cute and nibbly, why cover them? The gentle curve of the back of a girl's head when her hair is short -- you just can't get the same effect with a bun or a ponytail.   Personality wise, it just comes of as frisky and playful, as someone who is confident enough in herself that she doesn't need pampered plumage to make herself look good. She is who she is, likes what she likes, and isn't afraid to show it to the world.  For me, long hair can be gorgeous and sexy, but I worry about messing it up. But a cute, short cut? Holy crap, my fingers ache to play in it and mess it up. It's the sign of a girl who doesn't want her long locks to get in the way of having a really good time.  Tl;Dr: Short hair is just sexy as fuck."
shorthairedhotties,3buqtb,cobra1975,2,Thu Jul 2 14:28:45 2015 UTC,"I love ears, it may be one reason I like short hair, or long straight hair with ears poking out."
shorthairedhotties,3buqtb,renadi,14,Fri Jul 3 00:49:14 2015 UTC,"People like what they like. I didn't realize how much I liked it until a co-worker back in the late 80's, whom I was only mildly attracted to, went from long to very short. She caught me staring at her and I didn't know I was doing it.  Hiding a mildly attractive face behind hair makes it less attractive. It's better to reveal it and let the other person find what is attractive about it. An exposed neck and smooth skin that contrasts with the hair color goes a long way toward overcoming less than perfect features. It's a strong and confident look, so I agree with the other commenter here. Mix that look with a friendly, happy and humorous, strong yet still female personality and I'll melt every time. In fact, that is happening in my life right now and I'm conflicted about the situation for reasons I won't go into--it's why I chose to comment.  My now-ex-wife showed up at our first date with short, black hair, shaved up the neck. It's probably the reason I married her.  Most thin women look better with short hair, but fat women should never do it."
shorthairedhotties,3buqtb,spriggig,7,Thu Jul 2 11:40:58 2015 UTC,"It's not a typical look, I like a girl who stands out a bit It requires confidence, and we all know that confidence is attractive Most times, girls who want a pixie cut have a cuter face with the right shape, so the haircut ""works"" for their overall look Most girls who rock a shorter cut are normal sized, in shape or athletic. Chubby or fat girls usually have round faces, and round faces don't hold short hair well. I don't like chubby or fat girls, so 9/10 times, a shorter hair cut on a girl means the girl will be good looking (see #3) Somehow, their hair matches an overall style they have as well. Whether that's punk rockish, or uniquely cool.. there's usually an attractive or alluring overall theme to a girl who has shorter hair I can't pinpoint it, but there's a personality that goes with it. In my experience, SHH are funny, silly, sarcastic, outright goofy, positive and awesome.. more so than their longer hair counterparts.    I base a lot of my experience with the girls from my gf's salon. I am around both ends of the hair spectrum in terms of women on a constant basis."
shorthairedhotties,3buqtb,lispychicken,5,Thu Jul 2 15:16:02 2015 UTC,"Long hair is an indication of good general health. Hair cells are a quickly dividing cell that is more affected by environmental toxins and diet then most other cells, so only a healthy person with a good diet will be able to grow long hair. Very sensibly long hair has been held up as a cultural standard of beauty, because cultures generally find expressions of health attractive in females.  Now female beauty as a cultural construct is a very inward focusing concept. Women define their attractiveness not by what the men they interact with find attractive, but largely by what other women are doing. This is how you get really strange effects like everybody wants less makeup on women. Women are also more likely to exert peer pressure to constrain people's actions, where males exert peer pressure to force others to take new actions.  So long hair is a cultural standard of beauty, and women act to enforce compliance with the cultural standard. Rejection of the standard by having short hair then implies a counter-cultural mindset and a stronger sense of self. I find short hair attractive because I find the kind of person who is capable of making their own decisions about what physical appearance makes them beautiful, attractive."
shorthairedhotties,3buqtb,Maldevinine,3,Thu Jul 2 09:07:15 2015 UTC,A. It's often aesthetically pleasing B. Around my area there aren't a lot of women with short hair and it's nice to see something different.
shorthairedhotties,3buqtb,Chaser_41,2,Thu Jul 2 12:35:10 2015 UTC,"It may be hard to explain or understand as everyone has their own preferences (personally I don't lean one way or the other on liking long or short hair as there are many ladies with both types I feel are attractive), but with the short hair, to me it seems a lot of younger ladies there's that like an added confidence and you can see it in their facial expressions, eyes, etc. which really draws positive attention.   Perhaps some of it to is its a break from the norm, and just seeing a more ""exotic"" for lack of a better word is refreshing and exciting.   Never heard of the age indicator- thats a new one to me."
shorthairedhotties,3buqtb,sochac,3,Thu Jul 2 14:37:49 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to use the same explanation i used on my post from yesterday:   Growing up as a woman, I've always felt like we are taught that long hair makes us beautiful. Long hair is a symbol of femininity and we naturally become attached to that. I've always wanted to rid myself of this irrational attachment, so I did. Cutting my hair helped me realize that my body is mine and that I can do what I want with it, and that feeling is radically freeing. Stepping outside the mold of what society defines as female beauty is incredibly empowering.   Short hair leaves little room to hide. You're entire face is exposed to the world, eyes, jawline, ears, everything. IMHO, women with short hair are bold and strong and I want people to see those qualities in me as well.   Another contributing factor to cutting my hair was realizing that I have very thin, fine hair. When my hair is long, it just looks stringy and tangled, like I haven't brushed it in a while. After I made the big cut, I felt more beautiful than I had in a very long time. I no longer had stringy, thin hair that just hung around my face.   I'm glad you asked this question, I like this discussion. Cheers, :)"
shorthairedhotties,3buqtb,CandidlyKaelyn,3,Thu Jul 2 16:44:24 2015 UTC,"I've heard the ""indication of age"" thing before.  I don't get it.  I've never had trouble discerning age because of a hairstyle, but if anything a girl with a pixie usually looks younger.  To me anyway.  I'm into it just because my tastes are  far on the ""cute"" end of the spectrum, and I feel like traditionally ""hot"" women are a dime a dozen.  To me it makes a girl look delicate and more feminine, as opposed to having a big mane that obscures the female form.  If that even makes sense.  Most importantly to me, it indicates that someone *might• be an interesting person."
shorthairedhotties,3buqtb,Nihon_Lab_Tiger,2,Thu Jul 2 13:56:25 2015 UTC,"It's not about determining age. It's that short hair is associated with old women for me, so it makes me perceive them as older and at my age (21) less attractive"
shorthairedhotties,3buqtb,Hero-Sloth,3,Fri Jul 3 01:46:38 2015 UTC,"It's honestly pretty hard to say why I find shot hair attractive, or find any specific features attractive for that matter.  I'd say that a large part of my attraction to shorter hair might just come down to the fact that it's not as common as long hair.  It's something different and it stands out.  I also really like coloured hair, probably for the same reason.  It's cool to see somebody breaking from the norm.  Though I don't really think that short and/or coloured hair suits everybody.  If short hair was just as common as long hair on women then maybe I wouldn't really have a preference  Alternatively, as /u/cobra1975 said, ""short hair is just sexy as fuck"""
shorthairedhotties,3buqtb,nomadthoughts,3,Thu Jul 2 16:09:03 2015 UTC,"I realized I liked short hair a while back. I had this AMAZING friend, a lesbian, who had really short hair, pale skin and wonderful blue eyes. Since I met her, I noticed short haired girls' faces were more visible, their necks, also their expressions seem different. I think SHH lovers are not a majority - our society indicates long flowing hair is the best look for females, but I see it as more boring. Short hair is more bold, sexier, edgy. This is my opinion and I respect everyone else's - Also long hair does NOT look bad. Just SH looks better in my eyes."
shorthairedhotties,3buqtb,jskoker,3,Thu Jul 2 23:57:26 2015 UTC,For me being cute is a lot better than being sexy.  I find short hair to be very cute and proper.  It symbolizes maturity to me.  Plus you don't need to deal with the troubles that come with long hair.
shorthairedhotties,3buqtb,Dochorahan,3,Fri Jul 3 04:12:53 2015 UTC,"I never really thought about it. I think I just subconsciously assume that short haired women were a bit more ""out there"". Meaning, they're more open minded, spontaneous, creative, kinkier, and it just draws more attention to their facial features like amazing brown eyes or an entrancing smile."
shorthairedhotties,3buqtb,vonbrunk,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:16:25 2015 UTC,"I have a personal exclusive preference for only dating short-haired women. The way I see it, hair is like an article of clothing; when a girl has long hair, it's like she's wearing a hat -- whereas if she has super short hair (or a shaved head), she's more naked, so to speak. A woman's body is a beautiful thing, and short-haired girls have their neck, head, and shoulders more exposed, rather than covered by long hair.  That's always how I've felt."
shorthairedhotties,3buqtb,bluewolf37,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:23:31 2015 UTC,"There is not just one reason but several reasons short hair appeals to me.  I have always preferred short hair on girls and only certain girls can pull it off well, but I like that nothing is hidden with short hair. I notice the eyes, jawline, ears, and the neck more because they aren't hidden and I find that sexy. I also like that I tend notice their facial expressions more and that in itself is cuter. I also love the personalities of the girls that tend to have short hair more because they are more likely to flirt, be adventurous, and have fun without a lot of drama. In fact my exes that had short hair were the ones to ask me out instead of vice versa. Granted this isn't to say there aren't long haired hotties with this same type of personality but I personally found more short haired hotties like this.  This is not to say I don't find girls with long hair cute too, but I just prefer short.  Edit: I just realized i wrote something similar to you yesterday in the comments. Ohh well....."
