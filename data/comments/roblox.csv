roblox,3e52jn,HyperPwner,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:44:04 2015 UTC,"There's paint tools to change terrain materials without changing the occupancy of the voxels, if you want to do it manually. Keep in mind that certain materials, like Brick and WoodPlanks, don't have different occupancy levels and if the voxel is even slightly filled, it shows a full block Minecraft-style.  If you want to do something more specific, like replace specific materials with specific other ones, I'd recommend Terrain:ReadVoxels() to get 3D arrays of the Material and occupancy of a target region, iterating over the Material array to replace all of one material with another, then using Terrain:WriteVoxels() to write back the modified Material array and unchanged occupancy array, using the same Region3 you put into ReadVoxels."
