Banished,3e10ss,irrelevantmango,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:14:32 2015 UTC,"What's a good location? Before you place a hunting cabin, scope out the vicinity first. Look for herds grazing. Then watch them as they move. The grazing herds move to different spots, normally to locations too far away to be in any circle that they would have been in before. But other herds move in to different locations. If you watch for a few months, you can identify several grazing locations near to your starting area. Your first cabin should contain at least two or three of these grazing locations. Deer will return to these spots year after year, and you will bag them over and over."
Banished,3e10ss,nicordt,2,Tue Jul 21 12:41:28 2015 UTC,"You'll come to a point where you'd care less about good spot and are looking for any sort of empty spot that's viable for a forestry pocket instead (forestry+hunter / forestry[p.o]+hunter+gatherer+herb / hunter+gatherer+herb). Also, herds grazing doesn't matter, they're just sprites (someone actually did some extensive testing on this a while ago). What does (significantly) affects your yield are :   Travel time (hunting spot - cabin, cabin - barn) Amount of empty space inside the yellow circle, the less building and the flatter area provides better yield   I completely ignore those herd animations whenever I place my cabins. I have 10 hunting cabins on a medium map once, and most of them yield 800-1000s, with more stable 1000s on the isolated ones. I have one near my pop. center and it yields 400-500 and I often see herds hopping about there.  edit:(correction)herd animation does affect yield and can be a good starting point for good hunting locations"
Banished,3e10ss,nicordt,2,Tue Jul 21 14:11:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was mainly talking about the early game, where the placement of the first hunting cabin can be crucial. But you're right, later on it doesn't matter so much.  Regarding the deer being meaningless sprites, I have to disagree with you there. I have studied this extensively, and I have demonstrated over and over again that the deer shown on the map are actually the source of the meat and leather.

Banished,3dxmf6,adoreandu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:34:06 2015 UTC,I had a problem building trading posts. I have a couple of big lakes on the river and of I build my trading posts where the boat has to come out of the river and then turn and go up into the lake it won't do it. if I built my trading posts farther south where its a straighter shot from the mouth of the river to the lake trading post then all is well.
Banished,3dxmf6,Loves-The-Skooma,2,Mon Jul 20 12:57:53 2015 UTC,"I actually encountered that too, and discovered the cause. Trading posts can be placed opposite each other in such a way that it covers the entire river. For posts on the river, they'll be fine, because the traders don't do any pathfinding to get to those, they just follow the river. However, doing that will break any trading posts built in an attached lake, because those do require pathfinding, and you've blocked part of the path in the river, so the whole process fails.  Solution: don't block rivers."
Banished,3dxmf6,irrelevantmango,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:18:48 2015 UTC,"There is another issue with merchant boats besides blocking the river. If you have a TP on a lake, and the TP is in the direction that the boats come from, the boats may not be able to turn back sharply enough to reach the TP.   It is a special case, but a TP built inside the boats' ""turn radius"" will never get a merchant to call."
Banished,3dttpi,Supremee-,4,Sun Jul 19 11:59:58 2015 UTC,"Alright, here's the deal:  You need to produce about 100 food per person per year. This means that if your population is 100, you need to have 10,000 food production each year for everyone to have enough (and generally you want to err on the side of caution, so call it 12,000 food per year).   Now, farms generally have one of the highest food-per-worker ratios of all the food sources, and can get up to 600-800 food for each farmer you have assigned if you lay out the farms correctly and have the right crops. Herbalists are pretty good too, while hunting cabins are okay and fishing piers are honestly pretty bad unless they're really well positioned.   Now, any time you are planning to build a house, the first question you ask yourself needs to be 'do I have the food production for three more people?', because that's what a house does: adds up to three people to your population. As well, these three won't be producing food for several years (longer if you have a school), so bear that in mind.   Now, with farms it's worth noting that the AI isn't written very well. You do not want to make big 15x15 farms and assign 3-4 farmers to them, becasue those farmers will work on top of one another and you won't get a full harvest. Instead, make 6x15 farms (aligned north-south, not east-west) and assign one farmer to each, you will get a much larger amount of food per farmer that way. Also try to make sure that every single food producing building has a storage barn nearby; nothing hurts food production like your workers have to take long trips every time they want to drop off food. If you can put the workers' houses near their work, that increases production as well. Less walking equals more working.   Hope this helps!"

Clear area near city of all things apart from wood, place 2 foresters and a hunter side to side. 2 foresters each house with one planting and the other harvesting and 1 hunter. Next things you need are a firewood guy and a toolmaker. Then add houses about 1 per year and farms about 1 every 2 years.     Food should have about 50% on your available laborers, more if it's unreliable gatherers and fishers. Quarries and mines are not worth it, since they seem to cause deaths more than other professions. Harvest stone and iron from map until you can trade for them. Also as you start with 2 different seed-types, never plant same plants next to one another.

Your little citizens will somehow go through the barn to the inaccessible side and just stand there and die. If you see it fast enough you can rescue them with a quickly built bridge.

CC has a great assortment of upgraded and new buildings for sprawling urban centers, but it'd be nice to get some smaller buildings for the tiny, isolated areas as well.  Buildings like a small (3x4 or 2x3?) one room school house for 5-8 students, something like Elfecutioner's farm stand, his buildable storage carts, or JulyForToday's storage shed would really help those areas without having to plop down a large, out of place feeling structure.  CC's small markets are great, but still rather large, and the stalls are too specific for use outside of industrial areas. Maybe a generalist stall, which only has food, fuel, tools, and clothing? Having their storage capacity (or student/church goer amount) lowered accordingly, so they really CAN only support half a dozen families, is entirely expected to prevent exploitation, but having the option would certainly be nice.  edit: And yes, I already use said mods.

That one about asking for more mod customization by giving more types of categories to materials and such?  Any progress on such?  Do you/your team? have plans on making a new standalone resource managing game for us?   I just have a real craving for strategic survival games, all since Ice Troll Tribes for WC3 back in the day, Dont Starve is also nice yet not the same since it only controls a single unit, and it lacks enough base building.  If something could quench my longing for that feeling you get when playing the start up on age of empires or Empire Earth when you hunt elephants and pick berries, with a handful of crude huts in stone age civilizations. I wonder if there is not enough demand for such games or not, but if others agree with liking those areas of games then there might be money to be earned for those who would make a new 'group oriented strategy resource survival game'"

Banished,3d1oz3,Ra1nOfDe4th,11,Sun Jul 12 20:17:55 2015 UTC,"Having a market will improve the efficiency of everything in the circle as goods are readily accessible and centralized.  And when I say everything I mean it. Villages move food into their house faster, blacksmiths make tools faster. They are grand creations."
Banished,3d1oz3,thadpole,4,Sun Jul 12 20:29:24 2015 UTC,so the best way is make a small city(houses blacksmith and such within the circle of the market and then make the farmlands and such with storage barn and stockpile out of the circle?
Banished,3d1oz3,Derecha,7,Sun Jul 12 20:37:59 2015 UTC,"One simple way to do this is to create a hub with the market in the center.  One one side, place a blacksmith and a house.  Across, place a tailor & a house.  Another of the sides should have a woodcutter and an herbalist or a tavern.  The fourth side should be three houses.  Build a school behind the houses.  Build farms beyond that.  Barns outside of the market circle.  Fill in with other houses just behind the blacksmith, tailor, etc.  As your population grows you'll need another school, and a lot of vendors for the market, though you can start with one or two.        A note about the herbalist:  You should have one in a forest node, staffed with a single herbalist who is gathering.  The one in town will treat your populace."

Banished,3d1oz3,Derecha,3,Mon Jul 13 00:25:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  The herbalist collects herbs, which are then stored in a barn or market.  The citizens go get an herb, then take it to the nearest herbalist, who treats them.  You need one in the forest to collect, then you can scatter herbalists around, near markets, as your population grows.      Of course, if your citizens have a complete diet, they'll be at full health all the time, meaning you won't need all those herbalists (except maybe for looks)."

Banished,3d1oz3,Derecha,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:46:05 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry I wasn't more clear.  Put one in the forest and assign a single worker.  They'll gather herbs.  Then put an herbalist's hut in every population center, and assign a single worker.  Since you've built up the area, there won't be any herbs to be collected, but it doesn't matter because those herbalists are only there to prevent your populace to have to walk too far when they need healing."
Banished,3d1oz3,thadpole,3,Tue Jul 14 10:41:59 2015 UTC,"Basically.  I'm sure there are some more experienced banished players that can add to that and specify a bit more, but I don't know that much either!"
Banished,3d1oz3,irrelevantmango,2,Sun Jul 12 20:45:12 2015 UTC,"okay, thx for your reaction, waiting for the more experienced players to confirm it."
Banished,3d1oz3,nicordt,4,Sun Jul 12 21:32:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, markets are the circulatory system of your town. They sustain everything around them. Producers (tailors, smiths, taverns) particularly benefit from them, and I always locate them directly on the markets.  The way this works is that the producers have to stop production to go collect raw materials for their products. If they are located at the market, all they need to do is to walk across the street, and they are back in production. While they are busy making stuff, the market vendors will bring more raw material into the market. The producers spend less time walking, and more time working. Imgur Imgur Imgur"
Banished,3d1oz3,onionball2,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:40:51 2015 UTC,"You're correct. The market is more of a distribution helper/tool. And every house or production center has a list of demands depending on availability, houses for example wants X amount of venison, Y amount of fish, Z amount of firewood, depending on how many people living/working there. So the way the market works :   The market searches all available Storage Barns and Stockpiles on the entire map regardless of range for availability of the things listed on the list of deficits. Yes, they also does not care if the Barn in right next door or 100 miles away, they'll list both as possible potential source of items. So again, since people have been asking this over and over again, Barns should be placed as close to your production place as possible without interrupting their yield (multiple barns and houses inside a gatherers yellow circle will reduce it's yield, just for the record), it does not matter whether they're inside, outside, or miles away from the market circle. Market sends out vendors to collect the things from the Barns and Stockpiles, again regardless of range (they would however, pick the nearest one if possible). The more vendors you have the faster this process would be since they can work in parallel. Each vendor brings the stuff to the market. Back to first step.   Those listed are all the market does, nothing else. Your citizens and workers inside the yellow circle will then pick up what they want/need from the market, they don't care what and how many things they grab from the market and how/where the things came from, and the market also does not care whom doing the picking and how many they grabbed. The consumer (citizens/workers) grab things while the market keeps doing it's procedural cycle over and over again on it's own.  While the market doesn't directly affects how fast a citizen acquire their needs, it does affect them indirectly depending on placement. For instance, if a citizen need a pile of firewood and happen to see a stockpile with firewood nearby, they'll grab them from the stockpile instead. But on most/good city layout outside of resource gathering pockets on map edges or further away from town center, this means that your citizens won't have to walk to the edges of the map just to grab a piece of meat or a pile of firewood, same as your workers. This allows you to centralize your stockpile of well, everything in one spot and let the vendors collect things automatically."
Banished,3d1oz3,Blutarg,-9,Tue Jul 21 13:23:13 2015 UTC,"Markets are a hybrid of a stockpile and a barn, nothing more. You basically never need a market, they have a use for huge towns that want to move finished products over a distance. But a small town would for sure not need a market. But they are pretty and thematic and I like to build them anyway.   You seem new to this game. To answer your questions and thoughts: They wont help with health, and you dont need them. And wont improve the efficiency automatically, but may. You can explore how a market works later in the game. But play as you see fit and have fun with markets if you want them!   At start every production building and house are clustered tightly, so the producers and consumers wont travel far, since everything is close to get.   But later on if you design a city with a industry, farming and housing regions then they may need some markets so people can find each resource they demand close at hand."
Banished,3d1oz3,Ornlu_Wolfjarl,6,Sun Jul 12 21:54:57 2015 UTC,"Your english is excellent :)  Markets are great.  If you have a city that isn't very small, a market will help your people get a variety of supplies.  Really, the only way to have maximum health is with a balanced diet and a market makes that easy.  Also they increase happiness.  Try not to put houses next to a quarry, because that makes the people unhappy."
Banished,3d1oz3,Derecha,7,Sun Jul 12 23:12:45 2015 UTC,"Marketplaces act as a centralized storage facility, which makes sure that your houses are adequately and equally stocked with fuel and food, and allows blacksmiths, woodcutters and tailors to work more efficiently (blacksmiths and tailors pick their materials from the marketplace, woodcutters can have stockpiles placed next to them that they keep refilling and the marketplace vendors take care of delivering that fuel to your people). You don't need to have more than 1 vendor working at the marketplace until you really grow (at the size you are now I'd say 1 vendor would be fine, 2 should see you through for a while). Building most of your houses near marketplaces will ensure you have less starvation/cold-related deaths. Try to avoid small 5-house neighborhoods far away from the rest of them, just to have some workers close to their workplace. It's better to build 2 small villages, instead of 1 large one with small neighborhoods scattered all over the place.  I like to start placing the blueprint for a marketplace as soon as I start the game and pausing the building itself. That way I can easily build a town around my marketplace (and I can click the marketplace to check its range). I can build the marketplace when I have enough resources and idle builders (usually after the first generation of children start becoming labourers). Sometimes I'll place 40-50 houses around it and pause their build orders as well, and just unpause them when I need more houses. This helps in designing roads effectively as the game progresses and not having to worry about unused space later on.  Your city layout is OK so far. I'd probably get rid of those fields you have in the center of that hamlet and place a marketplace and more housing there. You could use a tunnel through that mountain on the west of that location and utilize the space beyond that as a farming field. If you are having trouble with your workforce or the weather, try using smaller fields. Smaller fields (e.g. 10x10, 10x5, 15x5) can be worked with far less workers for the same proportional harvest. It's better to build small fields at the start and go to larger fields later on. Smaller fields have the advantage of fitting in your town a lot better, and 2 10x5 fields can easily complement your food stockpiles for the starting population, along with a gatherer, a hunter and half-filled fishery. That school, north of that farm, also seems to be a lot out of the way. If your students take longer to go to the school, they take longer to become labourers. Sometimes they'll not even become labourers, due to becoming too old to be students but not having enough education (not sure if this is intended or bugged, but it does tend to happen). Your schools and hospitals should be near your housing areas. Hospitals are also important to be close, but not central. If someone becomes sick they'll work straight to the hospital, but everyone they meet on the way will very likely become infected, so you need to make sure that sick people don't take long or complicated routes.  Another tip would be to place quarries on non-central locations. The space your current one is occupying could have been better used as a trade post or a couple fisheries and farms. Quarry holes are permanent, and that area looks kind of central to the map, so you might regret having it there later once your town reaches a thousand population. Same goes for mines, but those don't take so much space. Graveyards are also permanent. Try to build the largest size of graveyard you can afford, as it holds more graves than multiple smaller graveyards of equal total size. Also, don't build them on central locations. I usually like to build them near mountainsides to keep them out of the way.  As you said, you aren't playing with disasters, so don't worry too much about this, but if you were, I'd say you'll need to build a well near those gatherer/hunter stations you have. Wells are used in case of a fire. The villagers can put out fires with water from the rivers, but for areas away from rivers and lakes, it's good to have a well nearby.  Try manually getting rid of those stones and iron from the areas where your gatherers/hunters/herbalists (foragers) and foresters are working. It will greatly increase your output. Foresters will clear out stones and iron from their work bubbles when they move on the specific tile to place a tree, but you can make their life easier and their work faster if you do it yourself with your idle labourers. Foragers will not do this usually, but having less tiles filled up with things that aren't trees will increase the amount of herbs and berries/mushrooms you gather. Hunters don't care about it. That foraging station on the far south could use a barn closer to it. The distance from the houses makes it a bit unnecessary if you ask me though. You'd be better off creating an artificial forest on the east of your main settlement, next to that lake, and making that into a foraging station. The barns you build there could also serve fisheries on the lake.  I'd say that the best way to learn the game is on Hard. It's frustrating at first, but it really puts the pressure on you to start learning efficient min-maxing."

From Wikipedia:  Min-Maxing     The practice of playing a role-playing game, wargame or video game with the intent of creating the ""best"" character by means of minimizing undesired or unimportant traits and maximizing desired ones. This is usually accomplished by improving one specific trait or ability by sacrificing ability in all other fields. This is easier to accomplish in games where attributes are generated from a certain number of points rather than in ones where they are randomly generated."

It's better to put these close to your production areas (so build barns next to farm areas and stockpiles next to mines/quarries/forresters/woodcutters). The vendors (market workers) will travel to them to keep the market stocked, but they always take as much as they can until the market is full, so you don't have to worry about storage areas being away from the market."

That's where a lot of the wood comes from. When I took that screenshot I think I had 3 active foresters. I like to have a lot of wood to have excess firewood to trade (usually just for livestock and eventually seeds). Make sure to have houses near the areas of production and nearby stockpiles/barns to increase efficiency and production rates.
