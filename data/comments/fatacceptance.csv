fatacceptance,3bx1ea,digitalpizza,3,Sat Jul 4 23:01:00 2015 UTC,"Will try to answer your questions fairly and honestly, OP, without being mean about it.   every relationship in a nutshell is I meet someone I really like, they like my personality, they enjoy spending time with me, and we develop emotional closeness, but when I suggest we date, ""they aren't dating anyone right now"" and then two weeks later they are in a relationship with someone thinner than me.   I've known many larger ladies socially over the years.  Almost certain you are becoming attached to every male friend who is thinner/more physically fit that you are, who spends any time with you.  Do men who are significantly fatter than you also reject you?  I'll be they don't.  Have you even tried or do you ignore them?  If your larger male friends don't approach you, it could be because they have low confidence and are stuck in a rut of not even trying.  Your slim/fit male friends may appreciate your attention and praise after they have been very harshly rejected or mistreated by slender women, but that doesn't mean they are on the hunt for a much larger partner.  You're serving as emotional first aid for them.  Stop doing it if you think you're being exploited.   Whenever I reach out to my friends for support, they try and comfort me by insisting weight preference doesn't exist   Nobody wants to take on the burden of arguing with you or hurting your feelings.  Telling you what you want to hear is easier.  Right here in the middle of the obesity epidemic, body fat percentage absolutely still matters, just as every other form of physical attractiveness matters.  Men and women both are ""shallow"" in that they want an attractive partner.  Putting on 30 lb of body fat is an instant surefire way to make an attractive person unattractive, and older looking.  Just yesterday I mistook one of my first cousin's daughters for his wife because she is a larger girl.  Hadn't seen either of them in years.  Thankfully I figured it out before anyone knew my mistake.  Women may appear to be less ""shallow"" about physical attractiveness because some are willing to be with a relatively less attractive partner if he has high social status and/or wealth.  Our culture in the West still hasn't adapted enough to women moving up in education and income to have lots of young and fit but low earning men out looking for much older or fatter lawyers and corporate executives to date.  I'm sure it happens, but it's uncommon.  Most men still expect to date down economically.   they complain about how the skinny bitch their dating isn't as nice as me but they still have no intention of leaving her.   Slender women are such a minority now and in such high demand, they can be as mean as they want to be and they will still be fought over by men.  Decades ago you took a decent figure more or less for granted.  Today you have to compete, hard.  With the exception of a small handful of fat fetishists, every man fit or fat, wants a slim girlfriend.  Being slim yourself helps, but you still have to compete over income, status, fashion, facial esthetics, etc. if you want a slim girl."

fatacceptance,3bx1ea,Narayume,2,Sat Jul 4 07:56:08 2015 UTC,"This place is mainly for fat haters to make fun of fatties and the occasional r/fitness reject to ""convert"" them to health and running. Reddit hates the overweight, so I would honestly try a different site to get some better advice.   Still, I will try my best: In my experience dating is a numbers game. Things you like about the other person versus things you don't like. Awesome personality is going to be a big plus, but realistically your figure will be a minus for anyone who isn't ""into"" fatties. That means you are trying to ""make the cut"" with a big red sitting in the equation. People won't tell you that, because it is politically incorrect and insensitive to do so, but the truth is ""not being attracted to the body type"" is a fairly fundamental turn off.   Now, don't get me wrong: there are guys out there who don't care or who care about personality substantially more, however they are few and far between. You'd be better off looking at dating sites for guys who are specifically attracted to your look or to go for guys who are in your weight range. Your other option is seeing if you can find a handsome gym buddy and use him as motivation to cut back."

However, I now realize something I should have realized all along: that the people here aren't making fun of fat people in general, but rather those among us who don't want to change. Which is a practice I still disagree with, but at least find understandable. So, basically, yeah, I know, this was stupid. Thanks for the link anyway.  For some people, accepting their bodies is an excuse not to change them. For me, experience has shown accepting my body is the only way I can change it. I'be already tried being ashamed, and hating myself, and letting others humiliate me. That's what got me to this weight in the first place. Body acceptance, on the other hand, has lost me 30lbs. It's far from the end goal, of course, but it's as far as I've ever gotten.  It's also worth noting that at this point, the downvotes are just making me laugh. Others' opinions have exactly as much power over me as I choose to give them. I can sit here and yammer all day about stupid shit, and a few downvotes can't do a thing about it. Are people being nasty to me here, really? Or are they just prolonging the joke?  To these people, obesity is a joke. To me, it's a serious and very real problem. And yet they spend more time joking about it than I do living with it. That's truly pitiful. These people must truly have no sense of purpose in their lives, and I question whether they're any healthier mentally than I am physically. And if they aren't, I pity them. I don't hate them any more than I would hate a cancer patient. The only thing I feel for these people is pity, and now that I realize that, I have all the more reason to stop tormenting the poor things and leave them to themselves."

Really? So not even a tiny bit of the blame falls on the event the person is coping with?  As for ""lack of control,"" some people don't always have lack of control, but can lose control when exposed to reminders of their ""emotional/psychological problems."" This is a side effect of dissociation, another ""horrible coping mechanism.""  You realize people are genetically predisposed to certain coping mechanisms, right? It's not a choice. What can become a choice, later in life, is whether they actually employ the coping mechanisms to which they're predisposed, but this comes only after an intensive healing process. Could they improve? Sure they could. But don't judge them for not having done so yet. Dealing with emotional trauma is fucking hard."

Are you disagreeing with the use of coping mechanisms? Because I'll have you know they're necessary. The brain is a scary thing. There are some problems that turn you completely nuts when you try to go cold turkey on them. I'm talking like babbling gibberish and parading around with a gun. The coping mechanisms are in place so that, at the temporary expense of your mental health, you, um, don't do that. Regardless, many of them are also involuntary, so disagreeing with their use strikes me as pointless."
fatacceptance,3asn8d,imagicanary,2,Sun Jun 28 13:29:14 2015 UTC,"I didn't say coping mechanisms are bad.  I do find it ironic however someone like yourself (seeming to be generally concerned about people) would condone or try to justify the use of a coping mechanism that is completely self destructive.  You should be helping these poor people see that being overweight is a serious issue to their health and try at all costs to help them help theirselves.   I'm sorry but trying to justify it in anyway is just pathetic.  It's time people take responsibility.   Your issue didn't make you cram a bunch of food down your throat.   You made the choice to eat too much.  You made the choice to not excercise.   Frankly speaking you don't become fat because you had a hard night and ate a tub of ice cream.    Becoming fat is a lot of bad choices piled on to another, not just the result of a night or two of coping."
fatacceptance,3asn8d,ohshnarfshnarf,0,Sun Jun 28 17:10:25 2015 UTC,"I didn't say coping mechanisms are bad   Is that so?   horrible coping mechanisms   Anyway:   I do find it ironic however someone like yourself (seeming to be generally concerned about people) would condone or try to justify the use of a coping mechanism that is completely self destructive.   I'm not really condoning coping mechanisms, just saying they're understandable and not really a fair basis to judge people. Should fat people continue eating unhealthy foods and loafing around to combat feeling bad about themselves? Absolutely not. But we should at least understand why they do, and refrain from holding it against them as people.   You should be helping these poor people see that being overweight is a serious issue to their health and try at all costs to help them help theirselves.   I agree. These people need help. But they're not evil. They're not bad or morally inferior. They're people with problems, not problems themselves.   I'm sorry but trying to justify it in anyway is just pathetic. It's time people take responsibility.   Look, if someone's not taking adequate responsibility, I agree, that person should be shown how to take responsibility. But a great many people with this problem, such as myself, are already taking responsibility for it, and also justifying it in the meantime. I don't justify my bad habits so I can keep doing them, I justify them so I can accept myself as a human being -- so I can accept that I made some big mistakes and it doesn't have to be the end of the world -- so that I can take responsibility, so that I have the strength to take responsibility, so that I have the emotional strength to continue doing what I need to do to change. (And that's exactly what I'm doing.) If you're going to tell people like that that they should take more responsibility -- if you're going to constantly remind them that they made bad choices, and rub it in their faces -- that's not helpful at all. That's cruel.  TL;DR: I'm already dieting and exercising, get off my back.  Of course, it's certainly nowhere as cruel as telling such people that they're gluttonous, lazy, stupid, and should burn. Those are the kinds of sentiments that lead to a need for a justification in the first place. (Unless your need for justification is based on your desire to keep being unhealthy, rather than on a desire to feel okay with striving for health as an alternative to suicide.)   Your issue didn't make you cram a bunch of food down your throat. You made the choice to eat too much. You made the choice to not excercise.   Yes, and it was my issue that twisted me into the kind of person who would make those choices.   Frankly speaking you don't become fat because you had a hard night and ate a tub of ice cream.   No, but you can become fat because you had a hard night and took your dad's dick in your ass. That doesn't mean everything that resulted wasn't your fault. It was both. It was both your fault (in that you could have not done it even though you went through something hard) and the result of what you went through (in that, had you not gone through that thing, you would most definitely not have done it).   Becoming fat is a lot of bad choices piled on to another, not just the result of a night or two of coping.   Agreed. And bad choices don't just come from nowhere. They come from our values, preconceptions, and emotional state, to name a few things. And those can all be influenced (not controlled absolutely, but very heavily influenced) by outside forces."
fatacceptance,3asn8d,imagicanary,2,Sun Jun 28 18:41:57 2015 UTC,"Well I'm sorry that happened to you.  It seems like your main problem is not realizing your dad did something horribly evil that I, nor anyone else could ever hold against YOU.  I don't think you understand that EVERYONE has some kind of coping mechanism.  That's my whole point!  (Congratulations on your effort to get in shape by the way!)  I'm not some fat basher and do not in any way feel any negative feelings towards people with weight problems.  My whole argument is that you can't entirely blame the situation.   Like I said if you had a bad day and eat a tub of ice cream that's not a bad coping mechanism,  I can think of many worse.  However, I can guarantee at some point you noticed what you were doing was wrong and unhealthy for your body.  Whether you stopped a week after you noticed, or 2 years.   I'm just saddened that you took your father's wickedness out on yourself."
fatacceptance,3asn8d,Corporate666,0,Mon Jun 29 02:36:44 2015 UTC,"I feel a little bit stupid now. I may have made some unwarranted assumptions here. Namely:   That since everyone else here seems to be into making fun of fat people, you must be, too. It's clear to me now that you aren't. A thousand pardons for getting on your case about nothing. That the people here were in fact making fun of fat people in general, and not just people who think it's okay / blame everyone else / aren't doing anything about it. While my sympathies go out to the latter sort of people, and I still think it's not quite okay per se to make fun of them, I can definitely understand the mindset required to do so a little bit better. I took all this satirical ridicule all too personally, and failed to realize it wasn't really even directed at me. Maybe I assumed it was directed at me because I've been the recipient of so much of the very same sort of bullshit in real life. In any case, I feel I owe an apology to the whole of this sub for whining like a bitch.   I think we really agree, I was just pushed out of shape about feeling hurt and defensive. This is especially ridiculous because, in fact, it wasn't even this sub that made me feel hurt in the first place, but instead my own oppressive and exceedingly negative body image. So I was blaming people I didn't even know for the voices going on in my own goddamn head. Scale of 1-10, how much of a shitlord am I? Actually, don't answer that.  You're right, I did notice what I was doing was unhealthy, and I stopped. I really just wish people would take that into consideration when they look at me and think about how disgusting they think I am, but I now see this is not the place to voice such concerns."
fatacceptance,3asn8d,wordjedi,-8,Mon Jun 29 03:16:54 2015 UTC,"As someone who lost 100+lbs, I believe it is most certainly a disease.  I know tons of people who eat whatever they want, whenever they want and they are very slim.  I know tons of people who are overweight and struggle every single meal to make good choices and they live almost perpetually hungry, yet they are still overweight.  It's not just about being lazy or unmotivated.  There must be some kind of chemical imbalance or physical difference at play.  It's like alcohol... I can spend a weekend drinking and then not drink for months without ever missing alcohol or skipping a beat.  An alcoholic can't do that.  I can smoke a pack of cigs in a day when I am out with friends and not even think of a cig for the next 9 months until the next time.  A hard core smoker can't do that.    I think the people who chalk obesity up to laziness or simple bad choices are just trying to feel better about themselves by patting themselves on the back for something they didn't have to do anything to achieve... like a rich guy from inherited wealth acting like he's super-entrepreneur-business-guy.  Thing about eating is that you have to do it to survive... it's not like smoking or drinking where you can go cold turkey.  Beating obesity is like telling an alcoholic that MUST drink 2 or 3 drinks spaced out during the day but they can't get drunk.  Or telling a heroin addict they have to shoot up 3 times a day, but just a tiny little bit.    It's an incredibly difficult problem to overcome."

But there is a lot of misinformation on both sides.  I have a very overweight relative who insists that she doesn't lose weight even when she eats 1,000 calories.  She had occasion to stay with me for a few weeks earlier this year - I pointed out that her ""eating 1,000 calories"" was really more like 2,500 calories, because she wasn't counting the milk in her coffee, or the sodas she drank, or the little piece of chocolate and the trail mix she had during the day, and on and on.  I don't believe most of the stuff people say about ""if you eat too little, you go into starvation mode"" (funny, I've never seen anyone who actually was actually starved remain fat because of this mythical 'starvation mode').  But I know from first hand experience that there absolutely is a difference in desire and drive to eat, as well as appetite between people."

fatacceptance,3asn8d,virtualliteralhitler,-1,Tue Jun 23 06:53:41 2015 UTC,"When I say disease, I don't mean something communicable.  I am talking about a disease in terms of something inherently different in a person - something like multiple sclerosis.  Something we don't quite fully understand that causes two otherwise identical people to have different desires to eat which causes two people exercising the same amount of restraint of their desires to have radically different outcomes.    I think it is the same reason I can get shitfaced drunk every night for days when I am at a ski weekend with my friends, and come back and not even think about alcohol for one second... whereas an alcoholic in the same situation would end up continuing the behavior after the 3 days, or a heavy smoker couldn't just smoke a pack in a day and not even think about it afterwards, as I can.  It's not that I am super-willpower-guy that is mentally superior to them - it's just that whatever it is inside that drives people to that behavior is different between us.  Perhaps disease is not the right word, but I know that when I took Topamax, my desire to eat just disappeared.  So whatever chemical difference took place in my brain made me more like my girlfriend who doesn't care about food and never has ravenous hunger like I had 24 hours a day."

fatacceptance,3ahxe7,healthynhot_at_450lb,26,Sat Jun 20 09:56:09 2015 UTC,sounds like he doesn't respect you or your TRUE beauty! 450lb definitely isn't heavy by any means & if he doesn't love your curves that's HIS problem.   he's probably moody cause he's not having enough calories so his body is punishing him by going into starvation mode. Maybe try getting more take-away / high-fat health foods in the house so he puts on a good amount of healthy weight (300lb really is the minimum for health!)

fatacceptance,31al5p,Fattybbom,4,Fri Apr 3 09:36:56 2015 UTC,"Most people here are trolls. The name was grabbed by someone hating fats so they couldn't start a fat acceptance sub. Most up voted posts focus on the poster's opinion that eating yourself to death would do the world a favour. If you want to start a serious dialogue with the fat acceptance movement reddit is not the place.   Also I think you have misunderstood the HAES movement. The idea behind is that you don't have to be slim to start a healthy lifestyle and that being active/eating well is still beneficial no matter what size you are. It was a counter movement to crash diets and eating things purely because they were low calorie (Diet Soda) for example. Essentially just because it has no calories it isn't necessarily great for you. Similarly an avocado is good for you, as long as you don't eat ten. Instead focus on healthy choices (such as veg) and regular exercise you enjoy. Obviously the weight often starts going down as well but the focus is on general well being rather than kilograms lost at the end of the week. Sparkpeople is all about the approach and the forums are full of people who have lost weight. Jawbone's UP program have taken the same approach by giving both a calorie count and a healthiness score to food.   Why we in the West have such a problem with obesity was very well tackled in ""Fat Chance"" by Dr. Lustig. Essentially it boils down to sugar being in bloody everything and low fat food almost being worse as the low fat is often balanced with more sugar and sugar is terrible for us (at least that's what he says). So eating the wrong stuff is more a problem than how much you eat. Have a look how much sugar a Twix has and you see what I mean. That and carbs turn into sugar and our diet is very carb heavy. Cultures with less carb and chocolate focus eat as much as we do, but are doing much better. What is portrayed as the ""normal diet"" (munchies? Chocolate bar!) is fairly fat inducing. Without a cultural change of what is ""normal food"", ""normal potions"" and what firms can stick in both I doubt we will get on the obesity epidemic. HAES practitioners have (mostly) however taken the first step away from that by trying to tackle at least one of those two problems while reintroducing physical exercise as something positive into day to day life.   A final note on the movement: No one claims that being fat and active puts you into a state of perfect health. It argues that you can improve your health independent of your weight. Some evidence suggests that eating healthily and doing exercise while fat makes you healthier than thin people who eat poorly and don't move much. Nobody claims being fat is good for you and no body claims that the next Olympic gold medalist will be obese. Just that living healthily is good for everyone and eating McDonald's three times a day and sitting on your bum is bad for everyone, regardless of size.   On the attraction front: I don't think anyone wants you to find overweight people attractive. If you don't then you don't. It is more getting constantly told they are disgusting is what obese people object to. It is tiresome and unhelpful. Many obese people have loving partners who they are very happy with so being told by a stranger how unattractive they are is just...weird and a bit creepy. Especially if it keeps happening.   Disclaimer: I am not big in the fat acceptance movement. I have enough of a vague idea though to hopefully answer some of your points."

fatacceptance,31al5p,Narayume,-2,Sat Apr 4 10:51:09 2015 UTC,"Pathetic.   Fat privilege is the ability to eat what they want? Eating what you want is what makes you fat. Anyone has the privilege of eating what they want whenever they want. The consequence is fat. Yes, consequence, not privilege.   Why the fuck do you think being able to complain is a privilege? Anyone can complain about whatever they want. You, for instance, love whining about what other people eat even though it has no effect on you. What you're saying is that it's somehow a privilege to have things to complain about. Like, if I lose an arm, am I privileged because I get to complain about only having one arm? If I get cancer  am I privileged that I get to complain that I get to die soon? Being fat is a horrible consequence of bad decisions or being fat is privileged. Pick one paradigm of hate. You can't have both because they directly contradict each other.   But if you really think being fat is privileged, I encourage you to gain those privileges. Because it's great to be socially ostracized and unhealthy because obviously being able to complain is far superior to social acceptance and health.   Oh, and shitlords, you don't eat as many calories per day, but because skinny people cling on to life, as opposed to fatties who have the self respect to die from a heart attack in their fifties while still working, they cost society huge amounts in caring for their old shriveled asses and actually consume more food and resources than the average obese person in their lifetime.   Do you see how stupid your line of reasoning is? No, well, people cling onto chauvinism. The dopamine rush from moral superiority is strong. Thank god I get it from actually pointing out chauvinistic stupidity rather than hating an entire grouping of people because you disagree with a life style that has absolutely no effect on you. Except you poor thing, you have to look at fat people occasionally! Never mind that you probably seek out images of fat people on the internet to make fun of them, I'm sure you make the sacrifice for the good of your human  breatheren(ie non fatties. Because fat people aren't really people.)  Also, you all keep talking about the HAEs movement sweeping the nation, but where is the HAES subreddit if it is so popular? I have something to break to you. HAES does not exist. It only has to exist for fat shammers because in that view, being fat is a choice, not an accident or mistake, so fat people must be sitting around talking about how great it is to be overweight. In the real world, fat people sit around moaning about how hard it is to lose weight. And if you've never been fat, you have no idea how hard it is to lose weight. And if you once were, odds are you will be again, so you might as well kill yourself now, you fat fuck.   Oh wait, I forgot. You're trying to get that sweet, sweet fat privilege.

And you admit it. Which is why I think you're the worst of the worst. But you can change anytime and it's as easy as being courteous. But I guess that's harder for some people than others.   Well, now that you've responded to one point with a study that doesn't contradict the point I was making, would you care to make another attack? Or perhaps try to wrangle with the other arguments I made? Maybe even try multiple paragraphs? No, that's asking to much. Just don't give up, pussyfag. I'm tired of you assholes running away whenever I challenge you on your bs. Bunch a bigoted cowards, the lot of ya! ;)  Takeaway: (because I know if you tried to read this it made your brain all fuzzy) Who are you to tell people how to live? Fat people aren't doing anything to you except existing. Don't like to look at a fat person? Don't fucking look. Which is the same thing I say to butthurt SJWs when the whine about offensive things on tv. All y'all a bunch of cry babies. Grow up."

fatacceptance,2etl3f,quintessentialreason,3,Sat Aug 30 00:10:33 2014 UTC,"The first sentence doesn't make sense to me. ""Are there non-redditor who agree with fatpeoplehate?"" if the question you're asking is this one, the answer is yes. There are thousands of people who hate fat people for a number of different reasons. They hate them because they leech the healthcare system, because they talk about genetics to justify the fact they eat like crap, and mainly because they want to be accepted. No, you van't accept fat people. Obesity is a disease, and a disease has to be treated, not accepted. If we didn't hate fat people they would start to feel normal about their weight, which would result in them not trying to fix their problem.  And for the second question: that's their problem. They have decided to become fat (and no, genetics have a small part in it. If you are fat, calories eaten > calories burnt. There is no argument here, it's thermodynamics), and they should know their obesity is a problem. If they feel offended by someone who points out the fact that they have a problem, then they don't deserve to be treated. And I could do the same argument: I'm a guy who has made a lot of sacrifices to stay lean and muscular, avoiding fatty foods and ignoring my craving. One day I stumble upon one of the hundreds of tumblr blogs where fat people talk about things like ""real men like fat women"" ""society makes us ugly, not our weight'"" ""it's my body and I can eat whatever I want, you don't get to decide if I'm beautiful or not"" why shouldn't I be offended? They are pretty much saying that all of my sacrifices were for nothing."
fatacceptance,2etl3f,Mrubuto,-2,Sat Aug 30 10:07:47 2014 UTC,"Ok, ok. You are saying ""if you don't like a subreddit, don't visit it""? Then why are you on this subreddit if you say we can't accept fat people?"

Answer to the rest of if.  With ""it doesn't go outside the subreddit"" I meant that people in real life don't chase down fat people on the streets with forks. If someone does, that's probably repressed anger and it's not caused by that subreddit. I despise any kind of violence in real-life, I'm aware that's a problem, but if you really think a subreddit is the cause of this violence you are extremely naive. That subreddit is nothing byt a funny circlejerk for people who hate fat people to make fun of them. They don't go around reddit insulting every fat person they see nor they go around the streets punching obese people just for fun. There are so many subreddits where people mock other people, what's the harm in it? In fatpeoplehate people make sure none of the fat people's name are not represented in the pictures exactly to avoid things to escalate."

I don't even know where you got these examples from.  All I'm asking them to do is what everyone is/should be doing, which is taking care of themselves.  They drain more money than you think too, their disability check can easily support them enough to the point they don't need to work and can buy practically any food they want. Got kids? Of course they do, that also equals more money for them!  Then those kids will grow up under the direct influence and will have a huge chance of ending up on disability too, the cycle continues.  At this point they are just draining resources and taking themselves away from their families and a normal life faster and faster."
