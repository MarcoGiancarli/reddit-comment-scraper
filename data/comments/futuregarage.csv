futuregarage,3d0a58,jim45804,3,Sun Jul 12 19:20:47 2015 UTC,Not jungle. Drum-and-bass. It's sounded like this for 20 years.
futuregarage,3d0a58,tubbo,3,Mon Jul 13 04:04:52 2015 UTC,This is awesome! Sounds very different from the future jungle I've heard before on Warehouse Wax and Sub Slayers.

Making a mix for the girlfriend at the moment and including the aforementioned song, which had a big effect on me back in 2012 (seems like ages ago, now).  Hope everything is going well :)"
