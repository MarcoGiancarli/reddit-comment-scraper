2124,3ds7oh,BeautifulPhantom,2,Sun Jul 19 14:56:37 2015 UTC,"I made a small contribution to this post, if that's alright?  Night 1: 09/22/87  Night 2: 09/23/87   Night 3: 09/24/87  Night 4: 09/22/87  Night 5: 09/22/87  Night 6: 11/13/64 (?!)  Night 7: ??? (unknown if Night 7 have a cutscene or not)  (ALL ARE FROM CUTSCENES, after completing a night!)  It's interesting to note the Night 6 taking places well over two decades ago. I wonder what it means?   When exactly the FNAC's taking place in the game? Because most of the recording feeds seemed very recent in '87, or perhaps that is when they were being viewed? That doesn't explain Night 6 though.  Now, I have several questions for you to maybe answer? I didn't really see any here that answered these, or I may have missed some.  What happened to RAT that turned it into a murderous(?) machine?  What exactly happened to the previous guard? Knocking a wrench into Blank's brain, running away, and then vanished, didn't really explain what happened to him. I'd thought he was the one that got killed in the factory somehow, but no.  Why did the kids turn up in that robot factory so late at night when they were murdered? Teenager delinquents?  And I think if Tragedy is actually an imaginary figure conjured up by Mary's guilt, it is possible that she borrowed the, well, inspiration from FNAF's Puppet. Meaning, she probably had been there. It's an interesting parallel nonetheless.  I wish I can help more, but, I'm actually deaf, so I only watched the playthrough and picked out the visual facts. Hoping for any transcript on Night 5 (if doable) and Night 6!  Sorry for the long post! Didn't mean it to be that long. :/  Thanks for  this post! I now understood the story behind FNAC...well, on most parts. <3  EDIT: Apparently there's a calender thing, so I noted my dates to be from the cutscenes."

Hell, maybe the nightmare animatronics were all intended for FF!  There were enough spare parts in the P&S room in FNAF 1; some sick twit could have been rebuilding them for maximum ooga-booga factor, and if they reused enough of the old parts they might actually be animated by whatever controlled their predecessors."

That's the practical side. Sometimes theories don't work. Period. At least for me.   And if you don't know, /u/-popgoes summoned me back. I decided to give myself an extra chance.

In FNaF 3, he is seen glitching in and out of different places in time.  I theorise that when you see Shadow Bonnie in FNaF 2, he's just glitching in and out of that world."

2124,3behep,LEEDLEMAN,2,Sun Jun 28 20:57:25 2015 UTC,"The Ladies' Night theory tends to usually go like this:  ""Mangle is male because in real life Ladies' Nights are when females get into a place for less pay which inspires males to visit. So it's more women than men. Therefore Mangle is a guy.""  What everybody forgets is that Foxy is also part of Ladies' Night, as he is always active, no matter what. So if it was Men = Women, that would kinda ruin the point. So for it to make sense, Foxy is the male that would come in just because the females are there."

2124,3b3bc2,ComN9,2,Thu Jun 25 18:02:00 2015 UTC,"Again, because the background and the banner are repeating tiles. Changing that section would form a grey arrow a thousand times around the rest of the sub"

2124,3b3bc2,ConstaChugga,3,Thu Jun 25 18:05:46 2015 UTC,Another thing: Nightmode background is still bright.

2124,3b3bc2,Vabawoo,2,Sat Jun 27 00:55:18 2015 UTC,"2124 is pretty weird on night mode, mobile and res. I assume the CSS3 isn't applicable for mobile."

Also, I don't think the animatronic in the teaser is Fredbear. Seriously. It says Fredbear in the source, sure, but I'm sticking with glitchy Bonnie.

And both of them involved the the word chugga in some manor.   Trains (steam locomotives anyway) constantly go ""Chugga chugga chugga"", so it was deemed ConstaChugga.   Now I use ConstaChymic because people also constantly point out how weird/stupid my name (Chymic) is.   I think I get the award for ""Longest but most pointless username backstory ever"".   Yaay."

I did write stories but barely any original ones during the time I came up with ""Pandrake"" (I came up with most of them in my high school days. Yes I have written a huge amount of stories).  Most of my usernames were inspired by pandas since I've been told I am like a panda hence I randomly just came up with Pandrake and later grew fond of the name and as well as it has a nice ring to it, and BAM! Pandrake.   PanDarcy was another random name, but it gave my duck OC a name -- Darcy."

I wanted to play it to see how it was, and I had to create a name. I created ""HenryFrench3Fries"" because of... reasons. My name isn't even Henry. I mixed my name with my favorite food (when I was 8) and number.  Then I started to play Minecraft in 2012. I used ""HenryFrenchFries"" because I kept forgetting the ""3"" at the middle. I used almost the same name as in Roblox because, well, blocks.  Then I started to use HenryFrenchFries everywhere, becaue I got so used to it. And Reddit was one of those places where I used it (I don't have creativity at all with names). But in January, after I realizing that HenryFrenchFries was awful and long enough to glitch some games (that really happened) I started to change it to HenryCGS in places that I could and started to use it as my main name in the internet.  I wish I could just change my name in Reddit without losing all my karma."
2124,3a2srf,HenryFrenchFries,2,Sat Jun 20 20:14:34 2015 UTC,"Copied and pasted from a post on the HiveMC forums a long time ago. Warning you'll probably cringe, this is from July 16, 2014.  ""Today I'm gonna tell you a story. A long story. No TL;DRs though. Just so you know.  Once upon a time, in Neshkoro, Wisconsin, a little 7 or 8 year old boy discovered something. He discovered the community of hackingediting the popular SNES title, Super Mario World. Now this little boy, being a very big Mario fan, decided to try this out. And guess what? He succeeded. He learned how to edit the levels into his own style. This was pretty much all he did for a while. He tried to edit other Mario games too, and guess what? He found them, and he edited them. So thus, when creating a YouTube account (and lying about his age), he chose the name Marioeditor90. And a little bit after this, he started doing extremely basic animating using WMM (guess the name for bonus points). But who cares about that blablabla. So this little boy discovered a game he used to play earlier in the year called ROBLOX (no hate pls i beg) and made some weird name like computersomethingsomethingdigits that I can't remember but he didn't remember the password (with his tiny little brain of his), so he made a new account called Marioeditor90 (dur). But, this little boy also lost interest in the game and never played it again (lies this is lies).  So fast forwarding to some time don't really care how long IT IS SUDDENLY 2010. The boy found ROBLOX again and was like oh my gosh this again gotta play it again. So he made an account named... Marioeditor902. Yea, he forgot the password again, and then a few days later made an account named Marioworker90, which he still has to this day but doesn't use it but he did today to check facts. Now, the story of my current IGN. And if you don't know already, le little boy is me. In fourth grade, I had a nickname. That nickname, was Mr. Epic. You can not believe me, but it's the truth. Around the time, I got back into SMW editing. But this time, it was different. Now I was inserting custom sprites, GFX, backgrounds, even blocks and bosses! I was getting better with it and experimenting more. I figured that I should make an account on the website I used to get the GFX and sprites, but I had already made one before in my earlier days that I forgot about. So I needed a new username. I thought back to my fourth grade name and had the base. Then I needed something after that. So I went to my favorite number, 777 (cuz it lucky). And then that was taken ._. (or i forgot the password to MrEpic777 but i dont remember exactly). So I just randomly put ""IsHere"".  And that's how I met your mother And that's how I got my IGN,"""
2124,3a2srf,MrEpicIsHere777,2,Sat Jun 20 23:21:41 2015 UTC,Back in Yr 8 we had this friend that would buy Minecraft for you if you have him $20. So I gave him $20 and he made me an account: My initials + 1 + 1/2 stack (1 + 32) hence LAK132. I just started using it for everything and I even got some custom car plates with LAK132 on them for Christmas. Thanks Mum <3
2124,3a2srf,LAK132,2,Mon Jun 22 13:50:31 2015 UTC,"Well, when I was younger, I was thinking on what to name my  Youtube Channel, and that was Gameboy Jr.  I got the ""Gameboy"" part from me being a boy and loving games. And since Gameboy was a handheld Gaming device, I thought it was clever. And ""Jr"" came from me being a little bit small and younger.   I've been thinking of changing it since I'm not young anymore, but I find I should just stick with it, cause I honestly can't think of any other username.  And now, I use it for every website I go on. Including this one.  And that's my story."

2124,398nra,LAK132,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:59:55 2015 UTC,"Fredbear is Golden Freddy in my continuity.  Notice the blackened eyes and missing ear?  It goes back to another comic I did, ""Requiem with a Birthday Cake.""  In that one, Purple Guy worked at the original Fredbear's Family Diner"" before they got animatronics.  They just had two mascot costumes, a yellow bear and a yellow rabbit.  He performed as the bear, who was named Fredbear.  Springtrap has fond memories of those days, and in the Springaling gag comics he swiped a Golden Freddy plush from the office and has been keeping it next to his heart (literally) since."

My head canon is that he's just like most of the FNAF animatronics, possessed or malfunctioning in someway that makes him a killer robot. I think this'd be a more unique animatronic because it would be more mobile, do to it's extra legs, and able to fit into smaller areas due to it's size.  Thanks for the support!"

If it's like how you said, if a player is looking halfway between the left and front angles of the environment, then we can't spawn in anything in the game in both the left and front angles, or it would look like the thing just appeared out of nowhere. If we have the player snap from the angles, we are given the opportunity to spawn things out of the players view to make it more realistic.   Also, full 360 degree spins in Clickteam are incredibly nauseous. Have you seen TRTF3? God damn"

When FNaF 4 actually comes out, then it would be a good time to create some, because there you can see what the nighmares look like, instead of just going off one picture that only covers their face."

Here is a quick rundown of the things i learned after being an idiot and making stuff without proffesional help.    Use the mirror modifier when you want symmetrical stuff!  Delete the face in the middle of the mirror! If you don't do this it will create a buttcrack effect when applying a subdivision surface.  Take time, a fantastic model will take about 5-7 hours if you are learning.  I spend about 1 hours on my first model and it looked like shit. Then i spend about 3 hours on my newer and they still look like shit just a bit less."

Go into the event editor.  NIGHT 1:  1.) Create a new group if events, inactivated at start, and call it Night 1  2.)

If not, it's quite easy  Place a counter, and name it for the door you want to use (LeftDoorState, for example)  Have an Active object for a button, and when clicked, add 1 to the counter. When counter >=3, set the counter to 1  Have 2 represent the door closed, and 1 to represent the door open.  When the animatronic moves to the door, have a check if it is open or not, using the counter we created.  If it's equal to 1, have the animatronic walk into our little office, an-  XSCREAM!!"

All goes well and -anti might be unbanned. I am currently conversing with them now. But this can only happen if you guys cooperate. it would really help that even if you weren't directly involved, that you post an apology in this post so I can show the mods just how willing we are to compromise.  This is something we can only accomplish together. Let's show them we will reach change. and anti, if you're going to be unbanned, there's going to be new terms I'm working out if that's alright. Please be open to this. Im working really hard on this. I can share the PM i send i you want, but I wont share their replies without their consent."

2124,367shz,-popgoes,5,Sun May 17 00:11:31 2015 UTC,"Ugh, this is gonna start a witch hunt...  Basically, the person sending these messages (I'm just gonna say 'you' since it's easier to type up every time) was involved with a certain level of bullshit. Yes, they were insulting the mods and as JeliLiam said further down this post, it was only natural for them to step in. But also, the mods were involved in some of the bullshit as well- the way they dealt with the problem could have, should have, been much better.  Modding, yes, is hard- I was an assistant and let me tell you it was not fun, so I can only IMAGINE what it was like to be a full timer. Just being an assistant beat me down and you end up having to spend hours a day just pressing F5 in the hopes that something will happen worth dealing with. There are far more than 25 a day, that is true. The mods do their job very well, and they are being criticised a little harshly here.  Still though, the mods could have dealt with this a little better. I wholeheartedly agree that things got out of hand, and I can thoroughly understand everything he said. I, personally, disagree with the criticisms, but I can understand why he'd think everything here and I can exactly see where he's coming from, regardless of my opinion.  To anyone reading this, please don't start a witch hunt. I know nothing I say will do much to help a potential fight, but just... be the bigger man, accept that both sides had their weaknesses and strengths and let's just move on. I love this sub, I think it's awesome, and I far prefer it to the main sub, but the mods are good people and I don't think that being a member of 2124 should automatically mean that you're against the main sub and everything about it.   I'm respectfully disagreeing with you here, anti. I understand everything that the sender is talking about, but I think it's based on misinformation and personal grudges. I think what we all need to do here is accept that both parties involved fucked up, and let that be the end."

2124,367shz,What_The_Frog_,2,Sun May 17 12:36:13 2015 UTC,"Wow seriously everyone is defending this guy?  He publicly insulted the mods saying that they are lousy and fucking sucked.  Then he tries to defend himself when a mod steps in by saying i was having a conversation with someome else and then you just came in to it Yes, because you where fucking publicly insulting them and critisising them.   If i go into a conversation with somebody on how the police sucks and don't do their job next to a group of policemen it is more than normal that they step in.   If i then go further to critisise them falsely in their face they have the fucking rights to arrest me. This also goes for this situation.  Then he goes on to use autism as an insult multiple times wich i as a person with autism can NOT stand.  He was being fucking immature so the mods became immature back, now be the smart fucking person here and delete this post before it starts some kind of drama/witchunt."
2124,367shz,JeliLiam,1 point,Sun May 17 09:22:05 2015 UTC,"Insulting a mood does not deserve a ban in any circumstance. It should be a warning, not a ban with no explanation. He's not even wrong though either lol"
2124,367shz,JeliLiam,2,Sun May 17 10:35:45 2015 UTC,"There was a strict rule about not posting critisism publicly but putting sending it as a pm to the mods.   He broke that.   He also insulted the mods while doing so.   So that's 2 heavy penalty's.  Yes he deserved a ban, you should not get a warning over 2 stupidly obvious rules."
2124,367shz,JeliLiam,1 point,Sun May 17 10:45:31 2015 UTC,I'm saying that the rules are shit and the new mods are pathetic
2124,367shz,JeliLiam,2,Sun May 17 10:47:02 2015 UTC,How are the rules shit?   You're just trying to blackmail people doing their jobs because you are still mad about being banned.   If you believe that this sub is so much better then why do you care since you still have this one?
2124,367shz,Cookaie,1 point,Sun May 17 10:49:52 2015 UTC,What are you talking about
2124,367shz,Cookaie,2,Sun May 17 10:54:16 2015 UTC,"O come on, it's clear that you are trying to make the mods look bad by doing stuff like this.   The only way i would think why you would be doing this is because you are still mad about being shadowbanned from there."
2124,367shz,Cookaie,1 point,Sun May 17 10:55:45 2015 UTC,"Yes I am,  I completely despise what they do and the older mods agree. I am not interested in going back on the main sub and I'm not shadowbanned"
2124,367shz,SpiggleWiggle,2,Sun May 17 11:01:52 2015 UTC,"So, here's my opinion on this:  Both sides are in the wrong here.  What really fucking grinded my gears is lies_like_lavender's comments near the end.  She basically fucking admitted to having fun when winding people up. She's not doing her mod-stuff to help the sub or the community. She's doing it to get people mad. And Based Basetown stepped in, saying that both sides are wrong. L3 basically then said: ""Whatever - I'll find someone else that I can ban.""  Ugh."

2124,367shz,Ozius,1 point,Sun May 17 00:35:32 2015 UTC,"Everything I have to say about this has already been said. So I'll just say this:  I never have had a problem with the mods before, but when you start saying stuff like this I've kinda lost faith in you. No matter the circumstances. Maybe it's because English isn't my first language that I think alot about what I say on the internet, but as a mod you should know better than this.  Also, poor Basetown caught in the middle."
2124,367shz,Pieking9000,1 point,Sun May 17 12:43:31 2015 UTC,"Definitely. They act like children. I get that they are retaliating, but as mods they shouldn't go over the top. A user is kinda more entitled to because they aren't seen as a role model, but when a moderator says shit like this, why aren't THEY banned?!"

2124,3675jk,Flhorn,2,Sat May 16 22:59:26 2015 UTC,"I suppose he is haunted, but I see him as something much more innocent than the others. Not sure why though, I thought I had evidence but I appear to be full of shit"
