Bulldogs,3e3hfb,kellbell1981,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:33:12 2015 UTC,Thank you!   He's about 5 and a half months here.
Bulldogs,3e3hfb,kellbell1981,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:46:54 2015 UTC,"You're welcome! My husband and I will be getting our first bully mid August. I just wanted to know how much time I'd have with my little girl in her puppy look phase. Ha ha :) Puppy look or not, they are the cutest little pudgy things. May I ask, how's the potty training going? That's the only thing I'm worried about as I know EB's can be pretty stubborn."
Bulldogs,3e3hfb,kellbell1981,2,Tue Jul 21 20:53:06 2015 UTC,"That's awesome. Congratulations. We were really lucky with Thunder. His potty training and his crate training were relatively painless and didn't take very long at all. It only took about a month and a half for Thunder to become potty trained, and his crate training was even quicker than that.  There are these things called ""potty bells"" you can buy, which I strongly suggest you do. They're pretty much jingle bells on a string, and you put them around your doorknob. When you take your puppy out to go potty, rub her nose on the bells every time, and eventually she'll start ringing the bells herself when she needs to go out. That made things much easier for us. The earlier you start, the better.  Good luck! Bullies are so much fun."

Bulldogs,3e26il,burnstyle,4,Tue Jul 21 11:29:06 2015 UTC,"We looked into it but they charged such a premium for bulldogs we decided it wasnt worth it.  Our bulldogs have each had major surgeries. In our area, the surgeries were $1000-1500. Harley had her ACL/CCL repaired. Braddock had his soft palate pinned back and his nostrils widened at the same time (be had sleep apnea) and a root canal when he broke a tooth. Harley has hip dysplasia but I don't think she'll ever need surgery (I think it did contribute to her torn CCLs in both knees though).  We did get a wellness plan for Banfield which is you pay $30/month and it includes all vaccines and checkups and you can take them in any time you want. We found this was worth it because my husband is a hyper-nervous parent and took them in for little skin patches or stomach upset or whatever. That, plus saving up a bit extra each month, plus CareCredit (which is 0% interest if you pay on time) got us through everything.  Pet health insurance may be worth it but it wasn't for us."
Bulldogs,3e26il,grasshopper_jo,4,Tue Jul 21 13:39:36 2015 UTC,"Hi,   I've worked as a vet tech for close to 4 years, so i've had the chance to work with most of the big pet insurance companies.   I'll keep this short and simple, Get pet insurance that covers emergency surgeries. Whether it be foreign bodies (your beast eats a sock, toy, etc), or if he/she has knee/hip problems, which bulldogs often do. I'd also maybe research if they cover routine medications, etc. Bulldogs tend to have a lot of skin problems which i'm sure you already are aware of (if not, then you got lucky), so if you could get that covered, it would probably save you a lot of money.   I know VPI, Care Credit, and Pet Plan all have emergency coverage plans. Unsure of the cost/premiums, but honestly, the piece of mind is worth it. It's not hard to get unlucky with this breed when it comes to health problems, and seeing it first hand and the costs first hand, i'd be better safe than sorry.   Hope this helps!"
Bulldogs,3e26il,ukrainesupport,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:31:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, trupanion. It has great coverage for emergencies and also I got it when she was extremely young/not dealing with pre-existing conditions which could be a lifesaver as she gets older (as she has now developed seizures, which are currently very nonthreatening to her quality of life). I like the coverage, although its expensive. Premium is high.   Its been 4 years. So far, other then some tests for seizures and a handful of scratched corneas from being a silly pup, she's had no issues (fortunately!). In hindsight i think i should have just put the money in to a dog-specific savings account, but I have seen so many dogs (not just bulldogs) go sideways. Im hoping to never have to use it, but figure its better to have it. I have seen so many EBs go through the foster system because of issues that cost several hundreds of dollars per month, I just dont want to be dealing with that."

Bulldogs,3dspcq,LazyFatDuck,3,Sun Jul 19 07:57:19 2015 UTC,"Schnickelfritz is the name of one of my wife's favorite beers.  It's also a term of endearment for children meaning ""chatty"" or ""mischievous.""  We usually call him ""Fritzie"" or just ""Fritz."""
