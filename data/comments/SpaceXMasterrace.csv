SpaceXMasterrace,35sby4,kelifson,3,Wed May 13 05:08:29 2015 UTC,"So does that mean that they'll still exist by 2042, or by 2048? Because a delay means that they're not on track, and something needs fixing/improving, and is usually a bad thing. But in this case, a delay, in the typical sense of the term, would be a good thing because then they'd exist for longer."
SpaceXMasterrace,35sby4,Cheesewithmold,6,Wed May 13 14:37:12 2015 UTC,"By 2048. Through sheer will power alone demonstrated through unforeseen delays they will continue to survive on even further constrained budgets.  SLS still planned to have its inaugural launch on March 15th, 2050."

The moon shall turn it's side and wallow in tears for it has not been yet touched by Him. Mars shall come closer to the Earth, begging to be walked upon, but only by His footsteps. However, this love soon turns to destruction as the two planets collide. The Milky Way galaxy weeps as it learns of the news of the destruction of Earth, for how could He survive such an event? As the planet-wide tears drift away from the center of the galaxy, a single finger caresses the outside arms, blessing millions of solar systems as it moves by towards the galaxy's lips. A single word is uttered; ""Hush"".   But for now, we wait."
