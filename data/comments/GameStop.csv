GameStop,3e450v,Skitzophraniac,5,Tue Jul 21 20:34:45 2015 UTC,There still has to be more to this. You have 7 days for a refund and 30 days for a defective exchange. That's our policy.
GameStop,3e450v,Skitzophraniac,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:46:06 2015 UTC,Is it because i had a 10$ playstation store card that i used and it was on the reciept as well or would that not matter?

GameStop,3e450v,zanethebeard,2,Tue Jul 21 21:31:08 2015 UTC,"I don't work for GameStop, but it sounds like a ""system"" problem, meaning the employee may not have known how to refund an entire bundle in the system, especially if certain items can't be returned (the PS Store card and opened game). I'm sure a manager could override it. If not, I'd contact corporate and talk to someone from there."

GameStop,3e450v,NikiFlash,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:33:11 2015 UTC,Did you tell them you wanted money back or wanted to exchange for a nextgen ? A bundle return like this even tho rarely happens should not be this difficult. They should have helped you no problem if you have all the necessary things.
GameStop,3e450v,Cutsman4057,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:18:05 2015 UTC,Did you have the receipt? Was it within seven days? Did you bring them everything you got in the bundle?
GameStop,3e450v,_depression,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:49:29 2015 UTC,Can you be more specific? What reasons did they give you for not being able to accept the return? I'm doubtful that they would tell you they can't accept it and simply leave it at that.
GameStop,3e5og9,Nikedude7,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:45:53 2015 UTC,This won't happen.   Contact corporate and they can pull a list of all the stores in the company that has them available.

GameStop,3e4t57,RichardCranium12,5,Tue Jul 21 23:27:19 2015 UTC,Known fact.  Honestly it's probably faster for you to go up to your local store to try and get it figured out.  They should have the phone number to speak to somebody immediately.  9 times out of 10 the issue is you're not using the correct e-mail address.  You have to use the e-mail address that you originally gave the associate when you signed up for the card.
GameStop,3e4t57,Kelldred,2,Tue Jul 21 23:34:27 2015 UTC,I'd like to say that dedicated line is faster but every time I use it takes about 25-30 min to get through. I hate calling customer service.

GameStop,3e3qwr,State0fChaos,2,Tue Jul 21 18:54:17 2015 UTC,"When you buy digitally through the website, do you get a code to directly download the game? I was told in the past that you basically ""buy the game"" on the website and just get a code for the same amount in PSN/Microsoft currency rather than the game itself. Is that the case?   It depends on what you buy. Some SKU's are for PSN or Microsoft currency, some are game specific. Most translate directly into currency anyways.    Can I use the $50 off coupons that I can purchase with my rewards points for a digital purchase? Or do I have to use that in a brick-and-mortar store?   Don't think so, most of the coupons say no POS (point of sale) cards or gift cards or third party currency."
GameStop,3e3qwr,babyblanka,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:05:07 2015 UTC,Will it say on the website whether it's one or the other? Or will I just find out when they send the email?   And that's disappointing. Oh well.

If you have a stack of games ditch those also.  Although the one word of advice I'd throw you is that if you are wanting a ps4 because you are unhappy with your xbone they are pretty similar.  The only good reasons to switch would be to play with friends or to play the system exclusives.  Apart from that it's not a big enough difference to lose that much money.
GameStop,3e4yj7,IamDabesAtNothings,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:12:32 2015 UTC,"I also agree with this.  They both have their pros and cons.  I like the Xbox because more of a multimedia blah blah.  May or may not be switching to get call of duty DLC first,  eh may never know."

So, I don't think you want a dam job since you are looking for part time because of school.   In seriousness: Download the application online, fill it out, and take it to the store. Please wear a nice button up shirt and either nice pants or nice jeans. Also, fill out the application legibly. It is very annoying to receive an application that just has scribbles. Most likely, that application is going all the way to the bottom of the stack. Hand the application to a manager (store manager or assistant manager). They are the ones who do the hiring. Hours are going to suck. Maybe 4-10 hours a week for a while, depending on the store. That is a common thing. It is a retail job, so go in knowing that and you will save yourself from many headaches. Be friendly, genuine, and approachable. That is key for customer service."

When you are returning the application, dress nicely (collared shirt, nice denim or slacks) and ask to speak to the manager.        If the store is noticeably busy, just shake his/her hand and ask when you might receive a call. If they seem to have time, talk to them.

Second store, employee took the time to go over my application, my resume, asked me why I wanted to work there, asked me questions about my past jobs, said he really liked what he saw and that once his gmanager took a look i'd get a call within a week, felt better but still waiting on the call.

From the store end, however, we can always return goods from the site and if the warehouse didn't have the book anymore, probably the only thing they could guarantee was the coupon. I think someone else mentioned returning the game at a local store to use the coupon and get the money back? I know that sounds like a hassle and although I don't 100% know how their system works, my thought was that maybe they couldn't partially refund you? Like I said IDK.   You said you were a former employee and I think you mentioned bending over backwards for customers at the store level. I'm totally of that mindset too, but sometimes, there's nothing we can do, right? Like, I had a woman buy a used PS3 and bring back the charge cable cause it wasn't working. I told her I unfortunately didn't have anything to replace it withâ€”new or used. She told me she wasn't leaving until she got a replacement. But I didn't have anything for her! I couldn't do anything except direct her to another store that had the cable in stock and call to explain. I can't make the cable appear from thin air.  I feel like this situation was similarâ€”not exactly the same. They offered you away to get your money back short of physically giving you money (probably because their system couldn't do that, but again IDK) and you were unhappy because this wasn't how you wanted things to go. You were definitely not being unreasonable, but please try to see it from their side too. It's difficult because you feel wronged but I truly don't think they intentionally fucked you.  Again, sorry for your inconvenience."
GameStop,3e024i,kurohaneshizumi,0,Tue Jul 21 13:16:42 2015 UTC,"First of all, I appreciate the reasonable response. So thanks for that :)  That cable example is a good one. That's what I would do too. Even though I couldn't make the cable disappear, I'd try to find another store that had one. To me, that's a fair alternative solution.  I guess it just rubs me the wrong way that when I got elevated to the call center manager, he promised to send me something they didn't have. I felt like he might have just said that to make me go away. But you're probably right that he didn't intentionally try to screw me over.  Anyways, I went to my local store this morning and they still had a book left so I swapped mine out. Guess all's well that ends well."

Guess all's well that ends well.   I'll be dammed. I would have though for sure that those evil gamestop employees would have held it in front of your face and ripped it in half.   Edit: I'm glad you were able to get your comic book.   You didn't handle the situation very well at all though, should have tried your local store first before spouting off online. BUT HEY, AS LONG AS YOU ARE SATISFIED I GUESS THE REST DOESN'T MATTER."
GameStop,3e024i,Bezerker85,0,Tue Jul 21 20:10:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, because I totally said all GameStop employees are awful, right?  No, actually getting the book (not a comic, btw) still doesn't change the fact that I got shipped a damaged copy and then lied to (or at the very least, mislead) by an upper level customer service representative of the company.   It actually doesn't change the fact that I don't plan to shop at GameStop anymore. I wouldn't call it spouting off. I would, however, say that you sound like a massive asshole."

Yep, that makes you an asshole.  Also, you've yet to point out what's immature about calling a customer service line about a damaged product, and then posting about the customer service experience in the designated subreddit.  Then again, I'm guessing your social skills can't be too amazing. After all, all your posts seem to be you basically shitting on people as if you're the King of GameStop."
GameStop,3e024i,babyblanka,0,Tue Jul 21 20:34:54 2015 UTC,Nice that this got down voted. Apparently it's a bad thing to expect  customer service representatives to not lie to you?

It's a shame. Won't be surprised if this gets downvoted."
GameStop,3e024i,BakaHyatt,2,Tue Jul 21 03:16:30 2015 UTC,"Already did. Not surprised, I guess. Apparently it's a lot to ask for a company that you've literally given thousands of dollars to to treat you with some form of decency. This just backs up how glad I am that I cancelled all my preorders. I can get anything I can get at GameStop elsewhere, and with preorder exclusives in the future, I guess I'll just buy the game for the exclusive and return the game after purchase."
GameStop,3e024i,Reputable_source,2,Tue Jul 21 06:37:25 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing you're talking about J Stars.  Have you gone to any of your local stores and asked?  The ones by me got about 5-10 artbooks and had 0-2 pre-orders so they had no problem giving me one when I asked.    I've never had luck with their online CS other than the live chat, but sadly the chat is gone. I'm currently dealing with their CS trying to tell me that ""1 ordered, 0 shipped""  means that it was shipped with USPS and USPS shipments don't count as being shipped on the website, which according to about 5 other USPS shipments on my order history, is not true at all."
GameStop,3e024i,babyblanka,2,Tue Jul 21 00:36:40 2015 UTC,"Yep, you guessed it. I'll see if any of my local stores still have. Although knowing that they have a ton of extras at the stores makes the whole thing that much more frustrating. Why couldn't they just get one ordered from a store for me?"
GameStop,3e024i,Roflrex,-4,Tue Jul 21 02:44:49 2015 UTC,"Because, you should know since you've worked there, that stores don't send things directly to customer's houses."
GameStop,3e024i,babyblanka,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:25:35 2015 UTC,"But stores can send things back to the warehouse. And the warehouse can certainly send to me. Or, y'know, I could have picked it up from literally any store."
GameStop,3e024i,babyblanka,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:32:43 2015 UTC,Stores typically won't send things back if they can provide it to the next customer as a gift. Especially since they'll just lose money shipping it.
GameStop,3e024i,Reputable_source,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:14:40 2015 UTC,They lose more money in the long run losing a customer than it costs them to ship a book.

GameStop,3e024i,Reputable_source,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:46:22 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I actually have no idea how it works at the GameStop Customer Service Center, but I imagine they should have some way of putting an order out to a store saying, ""we need a replacement, does anyone have?"" Then again, if they had mentioned that some stores might have had extra, I would have checked a nearby store sooner. When I used to work there our preorder items were very limited in stock. Apparently a lot of stores got extra books though."

Hours are going to suck. 3-8 hours a week probably.   Make sure your local store is hiring minors.

GameStop is not your answer and it's nowhere near what you would expect it to be like.   Get a job at a grocery store, or a big retailer like target or something. Way more suitable honestly."
GameStop,3dwrk2,tehjaybo,3,Mon Jul 20 09:53:15 2015 UTC,"I could honestly see both sides of this.    Yes, you'll get 3-8 hours.  But if this is your first job, it may be good to do that.  As is, if you're living with parents still, you just need some pocket money.  Working 3-8 hours at your first job would be enough to put a little cash in your pocket and still get a feel for what a future employment opportunity may demand of you.  Personally, I wouldn't want to start out right at 40 hours a week if I'd never had a job before.    But make sure you're ready to work.  Yes, we talk about video games all day.  And yes, it's pretty cool.  But remember, we don't play games at work.  There is always a lot of work to get done, and never enough time to be ahead. Even when you're ahead, there is always work to be done.  You will alphabetize, you will file, you will clean, and you will deal with customers that are inherently mad at the world because they don't read ""Pro member price"" on a sticker, and can't figure out why you're charging them 10% more.    Working at GameStop is a great intro experience for learning what a job will demand of you, and if you want to continue with a career in electronic retail.  The best thing you can do is go in, speak with the store manager or assistant manager, and ask any questions you have.  Ask for an application, and even if they're not currently hiring, fill it out and bring it in.  It's good experience for you.   You're a gamer, think of it like this.  Filling out applications, building resumes, asking questions, it's all gonna get you some XP. The more XP you build up, the better you will be able to pursue the job that you choose!  So get out there and level!"

GameStop,3dw4je,_depression,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:12:40 2015 UTC,"Yup, you hit the nail on the head. Especially for a handheld system, especially when the cartridges are as small as they are, parents and kids didn't want to carry around a half dozen game boxes.

Also with or without a refurb fee we can't take the system without a stylus.   Though you maybe luck and you store may have a random stylus sitting around in one of their drawers like mine does (though mine are for the XLs or 2DS models) and they are willing to just use that to help with the trade process.

GameStop,3dqkh8,JSuperStition,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:47:37 2015 UTC,Most small external hard drives are just internal hard drives that are up into a case. That's why you can buy cases for a laptop hard drive if your laptop breaks.

We handle that transaction for your convenience but the money goes to ups/usps because they are the ones doing the shipping and handling. It's their fee.   If you look around to pretty much any retailer/website's policies you will see this is a universal truth. The only times I've seen exceptions to this is when the product you get is not the product you ordered (or the product is not in the condition it was stated to be in but this seems to be a 50/50 shot)  It's one of the reasons I've heard a few customers (and I like the idea myself) ask why we don't have an ""Amazon prime"" like feature for our WIS for pro members. The price of the membership would have to go up a bit but not too much. You could also just add a new level of membership (like the level-up position training...basic, pro, expert) or make it a feature to those using the PURCC for online/WIS purchases.   Free shipping is nice."

Conker Bad Fur Day was getting $45.00 base, and with the 50% trade coupon and 10% extra from the pro card, got bumped to $72.00.

GameStop,3dmgyv,shadowmoses316,3,Mon Jul 20 01:18:37 2015 UTC,"First off, I love that you want to promote your store and you should be commended for that.  That being said, there's a couple of problems that have already been addressed by others and you've responded to, but I want to explain why its still a bad idea.  It is work because it is promoting the store.  You have to think of it in the frame of ""what happens if x person is fired?""  If your ASM got fired today and was upset about it, what prevents him from claiming that he was instructed to do so by his SM or DM to promote the store?  He could claim that he was told to work x number of hours on this page, and doing so constituted hours he should have been paid but wasn't.  We have people working for this company to specifically manage our social media, and here we have another employee managing a Facebook group in the name of one of our stores while not being paid for it.  The other concern is because it is out of the control of the company, but still in the company's name.  Going back to ""what if x person was fired,"" will this person go online and say a bunch of terrible things that hurts the store's reputation because he is speaking in our voice?  It seems unlikely until this sort of thing happens, and then it's a disaster that we're stuck cleaning up.  So, what can you do instead?  Lots of things!  I know an SM in my district who belongs to a facebook group for local gamers.  He posts the new releases each week on that group.  He just lines them up on a shelf, snaps a picture, and posts it.  You can join or form local groups like that and post the same information that you want to post from twitter there.  If you're setting up the group, just make sure it doesn't have GameStop in the name.  The same goes for Twitter.  You can use your own Twitter to promote the store, just make sure it's clear that this you personally saying these things, not as a representative of GameStop."
GameStop,3dmgyv,SloanTheSloth,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:59:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you for responding in detail. I can completely understand these concerns. I guess I was hoping to gain more experience by helping us out. It's hard to do things like this for anyone before you're on a set career path. I love my store, truly. I love GameStop. They're the best-run company I've worked for and are genuinely friendly. I just want to share the excitement with others.  Like I said, I wish there was something I could do. My ASM sent me the group he formed to do the same thing he does in it, which is the reminders, promotions, etc., as well as conversing with customers who share in the group.

GameStop,3djoxu,KIRACS,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:36:35 2015 UTC,What market?
GameStop,3djoxu,check_engine_light,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:25:54 2015 UTC,East market
GameStop,3djoxu,check_engine_light,4,Thu Jul 16 22:48:00 2015 UTC,"Don't know your VP, but mine was just in town.   Know your business, where you are for sales and profit plan YTD.   Know your areas of opportunity from the scorecard.   Use your tablet.   Act natural. ;)"
GameStop,3djoxu,check_engine_light,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:50:08 2015 UTC,"And the LP thing- depending on your position you'd want to talk to your immediate supervisor and keep an eye on the internal careers site. If you tell the big guys, odds are they'll say ""Ok."""
GameStop,3djoxu,check_engine_light,2,Thu Jul 16 22:53:28 2015 UTC,Visit went really well. I have one of the top performing stores in our district. I brought up LP to my DM where they could hear it. They stepped in and told me about all the directions I could take & and schooling that would benefit me. We're only here for about an hour. Thanks for the advice tho. As an asm I should know these things. But when you throw the vp in the mix it gets wierd. They also loved that I'm on a first name basis with most of my customers :)
GameStop,3djoxu,RandomPlayerJoined,2,Thu Jul 16 22:58:39 2015 UTC,"If half the ASMs in the company had all that on lock, the world would be a different, happier place. Way to kick ass!"
GameStop,3djoxu,Roflrex,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:44:15 2015 UTC,"I've met Matt before, seems humble & mellow but brushed me off a little after finding out I'm an SGA but changed his tune a little when he found out how long ice been there and what my ""role"" is. Julie, she's more corporate. From my encounters with her, she doesn't care about the little people just what the stores turnover is. I think his name is Jason, I didn't meet him(because my SM & DM know that I have a habit of being uber blunt and to the point and were concerned I may say something ""bad"") but, I was told that he's really friendly and treats everyone equally.  And yes, ask them about doing LP. Worst case is you get an idiot know/no answer. But considering you want to progress further inside the company, they'll look into it."
GameStop,3djoxu,DrewTheRobot,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:28:23 2015 UTC,Matt is pretty awesome. He started as a seasonal GA too!
GameStop,3dk4x3,tbrian2287,5,Thu Jul 16 22:36:13 2015 UTC,"You get to see our gloriously messy backroom, sit on a folding chair, and answer some stock questions. The interviewer will read the questions from a sheet and fill out some notes. Know how to answer stock questions and you'll be fine. Talk about why we should hire you as opposed to the 300 other applicants for the job."
GameStop,3dk4x3,MaximumZer0,2,Fri Jul 17 00:28:22 2015 UTC,"Man, I bet that sounds easier than it is.. I'm actually 18 and have very little interview experience. Have any advice?"
GameStop,3dk4x3,lacihparg,2,Fri Jul 17 00:38:04 2015 UTC,"Our job is customer-focused.  Talk about any customer service experience: good things, how you changed a bad situation into a good one, etc.  It's not a stock question, but my ASM likes to ask you to sell your favorite console to a customer she creates on the spot. ""I'm a mom with a 10 year old who wants a PS3. What do you tell me?"" and things like that. Not all interviewers ask stock questions.  Don't be afraid to be yourself. If you talk with certain mannerisms (I say ""y'all"" a lot), do it. We want to find someone who will bring skills to our work team and mesh well with the existing members. Be you, and good luck!"
GameStop,3dk4x3,lacihparg,2,Fri Jul 17 01:25:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your help! If you dont mind sharing, do you remember what you wore to your interview? Gamestop seems like a casual place, but I don't want to show up underdressed! I figured jeans and a button up would be alright.   What do you think? Where, on a scale from athletic clothes to a suit and tie, should I dress?"
GameStop,3dk4x3,babyblanka,2,Fri Jul 17 01:45:28 2015 UTC,"Well. I'm a girl, so my dress code is slightly different xD  For girls, I recommend khakis/black dress pants and a nice blouse. I went for a fitted, patterned, v-neck shirt that was modest and practical along with nice shoes.  For guys, a polo tucked into khakis/dress pants or a button down would be fine. You don't need to wear dress shoes or anything.  Your daily attire while working would likely be sneakers, jeans, and a polo, so just dress a little bit up from there.  Also, deodorant, a shower, and fresh breath go a long way. :)"

I went for a fitted, patterned, v-neck shirt that was modest and practical along with nice shoes.   I think I wore the same outfit to my interview, lol! Dress khakies (not like, hiking khaki's), with a button down white and black patterned button down."
GameStop,3dk4x3,DaUnknownGames,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:12:15 2015 UTC,Thank you all for your help!! My interview is Wednesday at 3 p.m.! I'm excited and nervous at the same time! Thanks again for all the input! You've all helped a lot!
GameStop,3dk4x3,MaximumZer0,2,Sat Jul 18 19:13:19 2015 UTC,"It varies but dedinetly no less then jeans and collared shirt. I would recommend khakis/dress pants and a button down, tucked in and belt.   Like I said some people are more strict than other, like my ASM is really chill but anyone who applies in sports clothes or anything less than what we wear at the store he just trashes the application."
GameStop,3dk4x3,DaUnknownGames,2,Fri Jul 17 03:45:19 2015 UTC,"Pshhh, from a sheet?   My SM straight out did it without one."
GameStop,3dk4x3,hewhonamedme,2,Fri Jul 17 05:40:26 2015 UTC,"I would have, but i didn't get the green light from my SM to do it my way. I'm just an ASM."
GameStop,3dk4x3,babyblanka,2,Sat Jul 18 05:35:13 2015 UTC,Ah understandable. I enjoyed my interview...very quick (maybe less then 5 min). but enjoyable.
