kzoo,3e37sw,Evil_Disco_Marmot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:37:31 2015 UTC,I could see Kalmazoo passing this. I find it less likely that Portage will.
kzoo,3e37sw,habbathejutt,5,Wed Jul 22 00:21:09 2015 UTC,Kalamazoo decriminalized Marijuana in 2012.
kzoo,3e37sw,Skywalk_Holmes,2,Wed Jul 22 00:28:39 2015 UTC,"Allegedly is what I hear from critics.   Like ""NYPD isn't allowed to violate human rights"" is technically a correct sentence, but that doesn't stop cops from still being excessive if they spot you.   Critics say the fine isn't as bad as the criminal conviction that comes with the fine."
kzoo,3e37sw,CRIZZLEC_ECHO,3,Wed Jul 22 01:16:32 2015 UTC,"If you're walking around the Vine neighborhood you will smell weed a couple times during your walk.  I haven't seen a marijuana related incident with the cops in like a decade around here.  I pretty sure as long as you're not smoking blunts on the downtown mall, the cops don't care.  I know the Vine neighborhood is pretty open minded about weed.  I'm sure other neighborhoods around kzoo are different and not as tolerant to the pot culture."
kzoo,3e37sw,hugeamountofunits,2,Wed Jul 22 01:28:46 2015 UTC,Forgot about that. I maintain that it seems unlikely to pass though. Portage seems quite a bit more conservative than Kalamazoo.
kzoo,3e37sw,habbathejutt,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:23:42 2015 UTC,"On that, I'd have to agree with you."
kzoo,3e37sw,Skywalk_Holmes,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:31:47 2015 UTC,They made it a ''low enforcement priority'' saying it's been decriminalized is a dangerous thing to spread. Basically if you get caught with less than an ounce it's still a misdemeanor.

kzoo,3e3kak,jage9,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:48:19 2015 UTC,Very interesting. I'd love to live in an apartment closer to down town but they're either shitty or very expensive.

kzoo,3e3kzu,mothernatureisfickle,4,Tue Jul 21 18:13:59 2015 UTC,"Shot in the dark, but when I think old tech, I think the library. You might try them."
kzoo,3e3kzu,Squirmin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:38:02 2015 UTC,I called the library and they loan out equipment IF you are staying there. I cannot imagine our entire family huddled in an AV room at KPL! That actually gave me a really good laugh! That is a good thought though!
kzoo,3e3kzu,banksnld,2,Tue Jul 21 21:18:24 2015 UTC,Can you move them to circular trays if that type of projector was available?
kzoo,3e3kzu,dirtytom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:17:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not certain, but the slides are all rectangular and all individual photos on each slide. From my research, as long as the projector fits the long rectangular slides (some only fit the square slides), I don't think it matters what type of viewer it is."
kzoo,3e3kzu,dirtytom,2,Tue Jul 21 21:16:26 2015 UTC,"I love old school, but if you have big troubles and your family doesn't mind you could have the slides transferred to a dvd or USB drive, I know it's not preferred but at least you'd have the memories available for viewing even if it wasn't in an analog fashion haha"
kzoo,3e2ba4,slightlyintoxicated1,3,Tue Jul 21 12:22:08 2015 UTC,casper has mattresses from $500 for twin to $950 for cal king  And you can use promo codes to get discounts like from twit   link

kzoo,3e2ba4,platoreborn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:11:11 2015 UTC,I've been thinking about getting a Casper bed too. Reviews seem very favorable. Hoping somebody here has a review on it.
kzoo,3e2ba4,Lamon72,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:19:14 2015 UTC,Yeah I've read a lot about them and it seems awesome. I'm just worried it wont be firm enough for what I'm looking for. I guess once I move into my new place I'll have to see whats up and could always return it.
kzoo,3e2ba4,nerr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:37:59 2015 UTC,I just seen on commercials from  twit and they look comfy and you can return them if you are not satisfied

kzoo,3e2ba4,cbsteven,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:05:32 2015 UTC,"Did this with Overstock.com a few years ago, a ""Full"" size mattress, just had to unbox it and let it re-expand/air out. Love it."
kzoo,3e2ba4,eratoast,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:38:04 2015 UTC,How have you liked the foam over time? I generally like a more firm sleeping area and I've always wondered about switching to foam if it would hurt my back and sink in more.
kzoo,3e2ba4,smpstech,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:09:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's been almost 4 years now and I still love it."
kzoo,3e2ba4,Stabast,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:12:17 2015 UTC,Interesting I'll have to look into getting a foam mattress. Just going to make sure I get one on the firm side of things.
kzoo,3e2ba4,Stabast,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:15:19 2015 UTC,"Before I bought my Tempurpedic (floor sample, half price from Jonathan Stevens Mattress Co. in Portage), I had my eye on one of these. Had thousands of great reviews, although I was a little skeptical because whichever one it was had several bad reviews about the foam compressing and the company changing their warranty to get around replacing them."
kzoo,3e2ba4,Evil_Disco_Marmot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:43:26 2015 UTC,Sears outlet has some pretty good mattresses for cheap.
kzoo,3e2ba4,Quiescencies,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:51:02 2015 UTC,Do they deliver?
kzoo,3e2ba4,kzoolander,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:55:01 2015 UTC,"We used Mattress Mart. There is one in Kalamazoo & one in Portage. Yes, they deliver. Excellent quality, good pricing."
kzoo,3e2ba4,Jacobneumann,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:36:11 2015 UTC,Thanks! 'Good pricing' How much did you pay? Or how much does a queen size usually run? I'm looking online but they don't have prices listed.
kzoo,3e2ba4,iowntheday,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:45:41 2015 UTC,"We got a full size, I think we paid $600 for it but it was a really firm, plush pillow top and was discounted from like $800 or something. I think delivery was like $45? Can't remember exactly. But they set the whole thing up for us, frame and all. They'll remove a mattress if you have one but we didn't. Give them a call and double check."
kzoo,3e2ba4,dutchie727,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:54:27 2015 UTC,"I've had good experiences with Seat n Sleep down on South Sprinkle. They deliver, as well.  I got a nice pillowtop queen with a frame for less than $700. That was about midrange."

Zooroona also has bellydancers on some nights, so that's fun. Wine Loft is very romantic, better for dessert and drinks. (Just don't sit outside if you don't intend on marrying this girl for a while, the bridal store will be staring you in the face!)"

kzoo,3dy85u,kzoolander,9,Mon Jul 20 14:42:19 2015 UTC,Disgruntled former Meijer employee here. I've replaced Meijer with Target and Aldi. Pleasantly surprised by how pleasant a place Target is to shop at.
kzoo,3dy85u,andywarno,2,Mon Jul 20 16:01:46 2015 UTC,"Which Meijer did you work at?  No axe to grind here, I'm just curious.  I've been shopping at the S. Westnedge Meijer for like ~30 years and sorta simultaneously love and hate it."
kzoo,3dy85u,rchase,4,Mon Jul 20 17:07:18 2015 UTC,S. Westnedge (store #22). Almost 4 years. Produce Dept clerk.

kzoo,3dy85u,rchase,6,Mon Jul 20 17:34:58 2015 UTC,"I definitely do know Denny. We were thick-as-thieves.  I didn't get fired. I graduated college and began a career. I'm disgruntled because the management structure and attitude that exists in that company is absolutely atrocious. I felt incredibly disrespected by the company and management the entire time I worked there. It's really too bad because Meijer is really a great place to shop from a customer perspective. But I cannot continue to support a company like that financially, knowing what I know.  Also, thanks for the kind wishes, stranger :-)"
kzoo,3dy85u,andywarno,3,Mon Jul 20 17:45:39 2015 UTC,"Super cool!  Yeah, Denny's definitely the man.  Love that guy.  And yeah, Miejer is crazy.  I'm so familiar with it, but I dread going there for all the obvious reasons... I mean it's still going to the grocery regardless of where you're going.  Had a friend that used to say they should have a one-stop divorce court upstairs next to the barber shop.  ;)"
kzoo,3dy85u,rchase,4,Mon Jul 20 17:55:21 2015 UTC,Yeah I love Denny too. A one-stop divorce court in that store would probably make a killing :-P

kzoo,3dy85u,andywarno,2,Tue Jul 21 15:45:43 2015 UTC,"I shop the one on West Main St in Kalamazoo. It's quite a nice store. Clean, organized, and the employees don't seem like they all want to commit suicide.  And there's some little things about Target that I really enjoy:  The baskets are comfortable and easy to hang on to.  The shopping carts all work well  They put handles on things like toilet paper packages at the register"

kzoo,3dy85u,ithinkimightbegay,7,Mon Jul 20 15:20:33 2015 UTC,Everything in the store costs $1 more than miejer and walmart. If I'm getting more than two items it's pointless to shop there. The other day I needed some ground beef and the only option they had was 8.99 for a pound of GROUND ROUND... I was so mad I left and went to miejer.
kzoo,3dy85u,ICanTrimYourArmor,4,Mon Jul 20 16:12:23 2015 UTC,Why are they disappointing?
kzoo,3dy85u,InOneBlue,3,Mon Jul 20 16:03:24 2015 UTC,"Westnedge can't seem to keep their shelves stocked.  Every week I plan out my menu and make a shopping list.  Then I spend 15 mins in the aisles of Meijer planning new meals on my phone, because they don't have the ingredients I need in stock.    I definitely make sure to check the weekly ad for sales.  Not to buy those things, but to plan around them - anything on sale will undoubtedly be gone."
kzoo,3dy85u,StDoodle,5,Mon Jul 20 22:30:06 2015 UTC,Yea the one in portage is shit. The west main one is really good.

kzoo,3dmkum,BigRedCandle,4,Fri Jul 17 17:21:31 2015 UTC,Ever since they started brewing Oberon year-round (8ish years ago) the recipe hasn't changed. Peoples tastes and pallets change during the winter months and when it comes out in spring/summer again everyone thinks that it has been changed when it hasn't.

Does the undertaker get to keep the gold or do they give it back to you in your urns because it would be rattling around in there.  I'd like my ashes to be spread over Lake Michigan but I don't want the gold in my teeth dropped in there."
kzoo,3dimam,urbaneyezcom,6,Thu Jul 16 20:08:45 2015 UTC,"There's an easy and humane solution. Instead of cremation, have your body preserved by an expert taxidermist. This way, your teeth stay where they belong, so Horus will let you take them to the afterlife. Ensure that animantronics are put through your joints so your loved ones can put you in a variety of cool poses. You'll also want a drive-thru speaker mounted behind your mouth so your corpse can recite your catchphrases, and the animatronics will make it dance to amusing songs. Think of a dancing Elvis M&M."

kzoo,3desps,letgoandflow,11,Wed Jul 15 18:33:45 2015 UTC,"It's gotta be uber. Last time a took a licensed cab, the driver drove his buddy to taco bell with the meter running. I would have bailed or complained, but the guy was creepy and I honestly feared for my physical safety.   The cab companies are getting what's coming to them, and it's glorious."
kzoo,3desps,diyorgasms,2,Wed Jul 15 20:13:55 2015 UTC,I only ever had to take a taxi once while living in Kalamazoo.  It was for less then 1/2 a mile and it cost like $15. We also had to wait forever for the guy to show up.  We usually walked since we lived in Vine but we were really drunk with a lot of stuff we had to carry back to our apartment so we got the taxi.  Biggest waste of money. The guy was also a weirdo.
kzoo,3desps,nicogor,3,Fri Jul 17 01:59:59 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure he is talking about non-Uber drivers that are trying to run cars that look like cabs but without the proper cab licensing. There was an article recently on MLive about how John Howard is the only licensed cabbie in Kalamazoo and everyone else is using a more lenient limousine license.
kzoo,3desps,cbsteven,2,Sat Jul 18 02:25:48 2015 UTC,Thanks for the clarification and link!
kzoo,3desps,PasturesOfPlenty,2,Sat Jul 18 04:04:39 2015 UTC,I'll just go on the record and say I don't think Uber is good for the working people or infrastructure of Kalamazoo. I'm willing to have a reasonable conversation about this but not a flame war argument. Down vote me if necessary.
kzoo,3desps,diyorgasms,3,Thu Jul 16 01:58:53 2015 UTC,"I'm open to your argument, would love to hear it."
kzoo,3desps,PasturesOfPlenty,3,Thu Jul 16 02:33:28 2015 UTC,"As much as I support something disrupting the existing taxi industry, I am not a fan of the contractor model Uber uses. It is exploitative of the workers for sure. Doubly so when you consider that the so-called contractors (really they should be considered as employed by Uber) don't really have a say in pricing. I've heard talk that a lot of Uber drivers operate at a loss because of Uber's pricing and vehicle overhead costs."
kzoo,3desps,bbqturtle,3,Thu Jul 16 02:39:30 2015 UTC,"This is a large part of it. These 'sharing economy' jobs are extremely customer-focused and almost no one is talking about the labor issues that are at stake in this new economy. It feels like our economy is taking a sharp turn into a new form of post-neoliberal capitalism where each individual becomes a corporation--Me, Inc.   It has largely been the responsibility of the employer to provide a benefits package to employees--health care, paid time off, paid vacation, defined benefit plan/401k, etc. In this emerging economy, 'Me, Inc.' (individuals), is expected to purchase these benefits on the open market. Currently, we really do not have the economic structure to support this. Yes, there are high-paid freelancers out there that have been successful in this new economic model, but as I have seen it spring up in place of traditional employer-employee relationships in the manufacturing, health care and service industries it just doesn't appear to be working well.  Sharing economy companies, such as Uber, along with the temporary and day labor industries, seem to moving us towards a place of precarious employment with piecework pay models. It also means you likely will have multiple employers to pay yours bills. Having multiple part-time and contractor based jobs seems to be a way for corporations to be off the hook for providing benefits.  I am skeptical of this way of working for many reasons--though I find myself in more and more employment situations where part-time and temporary work is the norm. I currently work two jobs and have to juggle the fact that if I work more than 40 hours in a week, split between multiple jobs, I will not enjoy the benefit of overtime pay.   I'm not saying that 1099 workers cannot be successful or that it is always a bad way of earning an income. It just doesn't seem like our economic system is setup for this kind of employer-employee relationship on a large scale. We should be defending our hard-fought rights to overtime pay, paid time off, paid vacation, FMLA, etc. I'm sure Uber is a great service to its customers, I have no problem with that, but we are all going to get caught up in these business models as employees sooner or latter, if not already, and I am not sure the results will benefit us very much.  Enough rambling. :)"
kzoo,3desps,josephcampau,3,Thu Jul 16 03:55:16 2015 UTC,"Just as far as not taking care of the workers goes, I know that having the contracted employees isn't ideal, but I have a friend that was a taxi driver in southwest michigan for around 20 years before über got here and then joined über. He says before, he had a lot of trouble breaking even, he earned around $70 a day and had to pay $35 in gas money.   With uber, he brings in more money per ride and also gets called to do more rides. He says passengers are more polite and that his regional coordinator is more pleasant to work with. His health care coverage through the ACA marketplace is cheaper and more coverage than he was getting through his company.   Just an anecdote, my understanding is that at least temporarily, this could be a good thing for the workers also."
kzoo,3desps,PasturesOfPlenty,3,Thu Jul 16 11:50:17 2015 UTC,"There's also the level playing field argument that taxis are heavily regulated in many cities (in some this is self-inflicted like medallions in NYC).  I don't have much faith in the ethics of Uber since they've fought tooth and nail to avoid being labelled a taxi company, even though that is their core mission. They rely on their drivers to be honest with their insurance and, i believe, had to be brought to heel on insurance for passengers.  Level the playing field, require all the exact same things for Uber and Lyft as the taxi cabs and I'd support them just fine."
kzoo,3desps,cbsteven,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:51:37 2015 UTC,"As a side ramble....  Kalamazoo has a public transportation system, it is not perfect but it is continuing to improve and get better. There will always be a place for taxi services to fill in the gaps but, in reality, we are already paying for this public transit system so why not use it and help shape it into what Kalamazoo needs.  Not only is public transportation already here, it is far more efficient and less harmful to our environment as compared to a taxi service. And whats beautiful about it, the more we use it the more efficient and green it will become."
kzoo,3desps,PasturesOfPlenty,2,Thu Jul 16 04:03:33 2015 UTC,"It's hard for me to imagine a scenario where I would use the bus system in town. Maybe if I had a daily commute to an area that had a convenient bus stop, but I believe a huge part of the demand for taxi/uber in Kalamazoo is people that have cars but don't want to mix alcohol and driving.  The bus is a great resource for some people, especially the working poor, and I will happily pay taxes for it and vote for its improvement, but our system is not anywhere near large and convenient enough where you'll see lots of different types of people opt to not drive their cars and use that system instead."
kzoo,3desps,berger77,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:30:52 2015 UTC,"Our bus system isn't there yet and, yes, taxi services are meant to fill in some of the gaps--late night drives home from the bar, etc. While the hours of the bus service are likely going to be extended in the near future it doesn't make sense to have buses running until closing time. Hopefully more frequent routes (also, coming soon) can help make the system more convenient too.  I think the bus could be a great resource for more than just low income residents. It can be a challenge in a small midwestern city to have an effective bus route, as we tend to be very geographically spread out. In terms of reducing carbon footprints a bus is far more efficient than an automobile. I would expect in the next 10-20 years that the bus system in Kalamazoo will be serving more and more different people, though I completely agree that first and for most it is about removing the reliable transportation barrier to finding and sustaining employment."

Having the good review up there is probably the BEST incentive to not do anything to botch the job. They probably used to offer 5% off if people said they'd write a review, but most of them probably never did. So asking for it up front, while a bit weird, doesn't mean anything because they aren't etched in stone."

I believe that asking for a review, any type of review, in exchange for a percentage off of goods or services is against Yelp's rules. It also just makes me dislike the business for some reason. This particular detailing business also offer a myriad of other percentage off offers that are most likely common, but are in my opinion just strange. For instance: Facebook like 2% off, sports fan 5% off, Facebook review 3%, and Yelp review 5%.   This business currently has one positive review on Yelp, which I have to question. Did the review come first or the 5% discount?"

I have worked for some of the car dealerships in town years ago and they would use his company for some of the more serious reconditioning jobs. When my grandfather passed, I took his minivan to Floyd to be reconditioned for sale. My grandfather was a hoarder and heavy smoker. For about $100 Floyd's team had the vehicle looking incredible and no evidence it had been smoked in.  Great Lakes used to be good, but costly.

If you can't get financed anywhere else and don't have a down payment you go to express auto and they'll sell you a car. You end up paying way more in the long run.

kzoo,3ctzvf,Methorabri,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:40:09 2015 UTC,"Do lots of research on a car you want. Every dealer I've been to will initially ask for more than what it's worth and what I'm willing to pay.  I've talked them down 23% at one place and I still didn't buy it because the car was still overpriced (the car is still sitting on the lot). Go in with a price you're willing to pay and by God don't let them talk about monthly payments. If you're looking to get a loan, go to a bank and get pre approved, as that will be extra leverage to get it your way. Craigslist will have some good cars and some bad cars, but since they are the previous driver, they will know the ins and outs to the car. At a dealership you will get a professional salesman that will tell you everything you want to hear to buy a car. I do not recommend express auto or the easy financing places as they are overcharging by a lot. If you have the credit, get a loan yourself and let the dealership compete with it or use it to buy a car on craigslist. If you don't have the credit, save cash and buy a car much cheaper before going to the easy financing places."

kzoo,3ctzvf,HalfRho,2,Sat Jul 11 15:24:17 2015 UTC,"What size SUV or car are you interested in? Now I don't know what you find aesthetically pleasing but I'll give you a couple suggestions. The small SUVs like the 4 cylinder Toyota Rav4 and Honda CRV I recommend for their reliability. It's easy to maintain and has adequate power. A crossover like the Honda Crosstour is a good (reliable) alternative that you can get the best of both worlds, however some will say you sacrifice some looks. These cars hold their value so finding a deal may be hard and it is much harder to find a deal on these 4 wheel drive vehicles in the winter time. The vehicles I have experience with purchasing and maintaining are the 2012 Honda Civic Si, 2012 Honda Accord V-6 EX-L, 2011 Toyota Rav4 (base), 2008 Honda Civic Si, 2008 Chevy Corvette, 2002 Jaguar X-Type, 2001 Chevy Cavalier, 1995 Chevy Cavalier."

I did eventually buy the truck from them after I carefully inspected it and drove it. They are very non-negotiable on price, so I had them do lots of work to the truck before I got it, however it turns out they didn't actually do the front brakes like I asked and never notified me. It was obvious that they didn't, and when I asked them about it, they said that their mechanic said the parts were fine and didn't need to be replaced. I replaced them myself and then had them reimburse me for the cost of parts. You better believe I bought the highest quality, most expensive parts too."

I've dealt with charter a number of times over the years, I've bad some good experiences and some bad ones.   A few years ago when I lived at Mansard House I had to pay for internet through Charter and then property management decided to include Charter internet with rent. During the transition, I ended up being charged individually for 2 months of service while Mansard House was already paying for it. I called them several times to finally get a credit on my account, but since I no longer paid for internet, an account credit was no good to me. It took me an entire year of bothering them to finally get reimbursed with a check. And it was still fucked up. They owed me like $60 and the check I got in the mail from them a year later was was something like $25 and some odd cents. Like, what the hell?  I never got the rest of what they owed me.  Every time I called it was the same story ""The notes on your account show that we've sent multiple checks to the address we have on file, but we will send another. Is this your current address?"" and it was always the right address.   Most recently, I purchased internet for my new apartment a couple of months ago.  The first time I called them, they offered me $40/mo with a free install.  I wanted to pay less than $40, plus since being screwed out of like $40 years ago, I hate Charter, so I held off and called around. Well, I found that charter actually was my only option at my location so I had to call back. The second person offered me $40/mo without free install. I told them the previous person offered me free install (like 2 days prior). They said they did not have that special running and probably thought I was just BSing them. I even had a flyer from Charter given to me by property management boasting free installation for my apartment complex and the sales rep still wouldn't budge on it. I figured when I got the first bill I would just take it in to charter with the flyer and make them remove the installation (which I did and it worked).  When they came to install it, it took 2 techs like 3 hours to do it and they couldn't even figure out how to access my wifi router (which was brand new and did not have a password set). When I got home that day, it took me all of 3 minutes to set up the router myself.  Since then, my internet connection has been solid and I don't have any complaints. But all this to say that, Charter is so huge now I think whether someone has a positive or negative experience is really going to depend on who the representatives they deal with."

A bunch of older folks said that they all did as kids as well.  Cops said it was alright.  The evidence that it was an alright idea was sort of overwhelming.    Edit:  I always like these replies.  Am I supposed to say something like ""Oh, the fountain is a fountain!"" as though you have shed some light on the nature of public waterworks?  In Columbus, our last home, a whole number of public fountains are designed for kids to play in.  Easton has some and a big park downtown is designed around the idea.  Swimming in a fountain isn't exactly a weird concept."
kzoo,3chlnz,Smithstonian,13,Wed Jul 8 03:35:28 2015 UTC,"In regard to your edit, no it's not exactly ""weird"" but it is gross, since public pools are pretty carefully regulated for cleanliness, whereas fountains in parks are full of hobo piss and apparently dead birds."

kzoo,3ccd8s,thepopdog,4,Mon Jul 6 21:26:31 2015 UTC,"The union cabaret and grill has a continuous stream of musicians highlighting Western Michigan University's School of Music. Many featured bands are right up your alley if you're interested in Funk and Jam. Professors also play there, so it seems like it's a central hub for collaboration. Typically when I see a show there, I expect great talent on the stage. It's a music-centric place when the show gets going so it gets loud, but makes for a great time when I'm feeling the music. I'm not a musician myself, this is just what I have observed as a patron of the Union for the last few years."
kzoo,3ccd8s,nutw07,3,Mon Jul 6 22:16:13 2015 UTC,"can confirm. the school makes a big effort to put reliably solid acts on their stage a few times a month. the current crop of students is really into classic funk/70s groove, so if you dig that make sure to catch Crime Funk or the Kalamazoo Funk Collective. Rupert's has a jazz jam every tuesday and a lot of WMU jazz people congregate there as well.   Kzoo has a a pretty great music scene for both amateurs and pros, considering the size of the city. Satellite Records on Westnedge is kind of a hub for the DIY scene in town, they host a lot of shows and the guys that work there are very much in-the-know about the community."
kzoo,3ccd8s,StarkFists,3,Tue Jul 7 01:59:45 2015 UTC,"Check in at Satellite Records on Westnedge close to the downtown area in the Vine Neighborhood. The folks that work there (specifically a very blond man with a bushy beard named Sean) could/can very easily give you some pointers. They also constantly have posters up for shows and the like. DITkalamazoo.com is the website to check out for even more info. The folks who run selnerbros.com (a music store that'll be opening here in town soon) also have some pretty deep connections to the music community, both in and outside of the house venue scene. You can get in touch with them on their facebook I do believe .  I used to live at one of the bigger house venues for 4 years (moved out last November), and I can say with a certainty that while not EVERY house show will be for you, there will be some that are. You can bandcamp or google bands that are coming into town and take a listen to them before you head to the shows, and you can get a decent idea of what the crowd will be like. Most of the venues are very respectful and run smoothly. The ""be excellent to each other"" rule is taken very seriously, and most houses aren't afraid to kick the shitty people out.  The 411 Club has (or at least had) a blues jam night once a week - which might fit your style a little more than the house venues. |  The Union is a pretty happening place as well, that keeps mostly WMU students and faculty in and out, if that's your kind of thing. They occasionally also have jam nights, but I don't frequent there, so I can't give you much more to that.  If you're looking for straight up professionals to work with, like people who are thoroughly trained and not just self-taught who do music for a living, you might be a little more hard-pressed. But there is certainly a lot of professional-level talent in the area.  On a slightly higher-up-not-college-student-centric level, Bells puts on a lot of higher-quality shows (being that they actually have a full stage/light/soundboard of a decent size) that might be worth your while to check out."

However, now,  as a farm owner I can tell you it sucks a royal D.   My animals are freaked to f out for days. Due to people lighting up loud ass fireworks.  There have been MANY dogs that have run off from being scared of fireworks and at least one horse that has went MIA from being scared crazy from fireworks.

There was no ventilation fans on and our sweat was condensing on the walls.   The firefighters told us that the reason it took so long is due to the Radisson being cheap and not paying $250 to put in an emergency box for rescue workers. They had to get bolt cutters to access the main elevator controls on the roof to shut off the power. I guess there is an electromagnet which holds it shut."

Al Sabo would be great except it's technically not legal, very rarely patrolled by Kalamazoo police on 4-wheeler.  I know people do it though.  Problems with Fort Custer are tons of poison ivy, no alcohol allowed, and it's a pretty huge campground so if it's crowded and you don't get the choice spots it will not be private.    Some smaller, cheaper spots I've tried before are Deep Lake for $13/nightup at Yankee Springs State Park, and Allegan State Game Area (3 different campgroundsat $12/night).

It's a start, but it would be nice to be able to recycle more things since I have a stockpile of glass containers (like pasta jars, etc.) that I cannot recycle at my apartment."
kzoo,3bn7xx,zdean,5,Tue Jun 30 16:02:56 2015 UTC,"I'm in Kalamazoo, and I felt it. About 2 seconds of noticeable rumble and my garage creaked ominously.    It was nothing like last month when we had that 4.1 here (first in many many years).  But since that one was so recent, I instantly recognized it as a quake from the very minimal rumbling echoes we got here this morning.  Thanks for posting, I looked up USGS, but I was probably too early for the data to have shown up."
kzoo,3bn7xx,rchase,6,Tue Jun 30 16:23:10 2015 UTC,"I felt it in kzoo. I felt the last one on May 2nd also. This one was a light rumble sound. There are train tracks down from my work so I thought it was just the train, but then my FB blew up with earthquakes posts. Then I checked WWMT and they had it posted."
kzoo,3bn7xx,alexphoenixphoto,3,Tue Jun 30 16:34:03 2015 UTC,I heard it in Kzoo-can't say I felt anything. Like trucks rumbling by.

kzoo,3bn7xx,banksnld,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:18:52 2015 UTC,"Felt it at Firekeepers. Not much more than the room shaking a little, then a low rumble for 10-15 seconds after the initial hit."

Meaning the little AC can't move enough air to cool your home when it's super hot outside. If you can send me the square footage of your house and the size of the AC unit I'll be glad to let you know if it's the proper size. I hope you guys get this mess straightened out!

kzoo,3bjo6p,mdk10,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:53:19 2015 UTC,KVCC has dental students who do inexpensive work. Dental insurance is very cheap btw. Out of pocket - it is like just as cheap or break even compared to buying 1 set of xrays a year + 2 dental cleanings.  Groupon/Kazoopons might have something like a dental cleaning near by as well.

A: they have the cheaper model than I'm selling, my contact in china says that that model has a shorter battery life and a lower top speed because mine uses a samsung battery instead of the generic chinese battery... not sure how accurate that is. My contact definitely sells both though.  B: Looks like they took advantage of a bigger bulk discount than I got.  C: Their shipping looks like it would take a very long time.  I still think my product has a ton of value, so maybe I'll look into buying the cheaper model or setting up a booth at a show of some kind."

kzoo,3bbwd4,fezzisfezz,8,Sat Jun 27 19:14:03 2015 UTC,"I can tell you a few things about many of the gyms around town.   First of all, we have your typical box gyms like Planet Fitness, etc., but if you're fairly serious about lifting you'll probably want to be somewhere with a little more equipment, right? There are a few good/tolerable gyms for that.   West Hills Athletic Club- this is where I lift. It's just of Stadium drive near 131. There are two power racks and plenty of free weights, the dumbbells go up to 110lbs. It has plenty of floor space on the weightroom floor. There are indoor tennis courts and you have access to Western's swimming pool for certain hours. They offer classes and also have some of the most reputable legit personal trainers in town. About $40/mo  Strength Beyond- this one is out on Gull road. This gym feels the most like a powerlifting gym, especially since the owner has lots of trophies displayed right out by the front desk. There are several power racks and lots of free weights, but the equipment is old and showing its age. They also have a good variety of machines for assistance work. The facility is basically a warehouse, and it's not kept particularly clean, but the atmosphere is that everybody is there to do work. Not a lot of floor space here, but they do have a ""yoga studio"" you can use for stretching, etc. i'm not sure of the price, but I think it's in the range of $20-$30/mo  Family fitness- I don't know much about this gym, it's been a long time since I went there. If I remember correctly, it's pretty open. I do know (by word of mouth) that their weightroom is supposed to be pretty good, so you should definitely check it out. Around $20/mo  Then we have the crossfit boxes. There are 2, both on the Portage side of town if you're into that.   YMCA has 2 locations and at least one of them has a decent weightroom according to a friend of mine. they also have basketball courts and tennis courts, and I think maybe a pool as well. Around $30-$40/mo  There are also the hospital health clubs, by these are pricey, and I have no idea what type of lifting equipment they have. You'd have to look into them on your own.   I hope this helps! Don't quote me on the prices, I'm not confident in them, but when I was looking around the price range was right about where I have them."
kzoo,3bbwd4,rule_27,6,Sat Jun 27 21:01:47 2015 UTC,"Damn, dude.  I haven't lifted more than a sack of lawn clippings after mowing my lawn in years, but that is one helluva comprehensive comment.  Nicely written.  We need more folks like you on /r/kzoo."
kzoo,3bbwd4,rchase,2,Sun Jun 28 01:19:02 2015 UTC,"My man, that was excellent. West Hills and Strength Beyond sound closest to what I'm looking for. I'm most definitely trying to avoid a Planet Fitness-type place."

It's a small gym, but recently I think they did some updating--mostly by rearranging their equipment. I used to be a member, but I outgrew the place. It's a very small gym, one power rack, only 2 flat benches. The free weights they have are in decent shape, but a lot of their machines have missing non-essential pieces (like a grip off the pull-up station). They do have a pool/hot tub but the hot tub is frequently broken...although they might have gotten rid of the hot tub in the rennovations.

The Kalamazoo Promise is amazing. Sure, there'll be critics and stuff, but it was one of the easiest forms I filled out for college, and I only had to fill it out once for all 5 years. It's easy to use, you need to keep like a 2.0-2.5 minimum (I don't actually know the minimum - but I was never in danger of losing the Promise), and it does open doors for students who would never otherwise step foot on a college campus.  I'd like it if KPS did more to help college prep the students, but maybe they do now.

And it's in the best interest of those businesses to foster a skilled workforce and prevent ""brain drain"" from the community.  I can tell you as a parent, it's the best thing that's happened to our family.  We just graduated our first and she stepped straight out of college into a high 5 figure salaried position.  And we've two more on the way.  Such a blessing."

kzoo,3b2i4i,speed_phreak,5,Thu Jun 25 16:36:33 2015 UTC,"No, I actually didn't. :("
kzoo,3b2i4i,speed_phreak,2,Thu Jun 25 18:20:13 2015 UTC,"Ya, you can take it to be recycled (don't know if the city still does that regularly, or just once/twice per year). I also believe that Home Depot/Menards/Lowes all have paint recycle programs.  Or, if you pop the lids (in a well ventilated area) and let it completely dry up, you can then safely dispose of it in the trash.  When it's wet, it's considered a hazardous material as far as the landfill."
kzoo,3b2i4i,HyphySymphony,6,Thu Jun 25 20:59:20 2015 UTC,"Latex based paints are the ones you can dry out and dispose of, but other types of paints need to be taken to the Hazardous Waste Disposal Center by the fair grounds."

I asked if they knew it was illegal and they said that they didn't so I wrote some relevant content in the hopes of educating and enlightening.  Additional people then chimed in with further relevant comments and opinions.  Now, perhaps you read the same information I did but interpreted it differently. This is entirely possible; I imagine it to be much more difficult to read from way up there on your high horse.  Now, it is also entirely possible that I pulled inaccurate conclusions from the data. If so, my comment still serves to educate and enlighten as well as promotes awareness of, and solutions to the all too common problem of improper household waste disposal."

I live in the neighborhood and there are some seriously mentally unstable people that live in this area.   If you didn't realize that before putting your business there, I'm sorry, but it's relatively common for stuff like this to happen. It's never people who are 100% there, it's always the people who definitely have some sort of untreated mental illness."

kzoo,3awzyi,BrandonCarlson,4,Wed Jun 24 04:29:10 2015 UTC,Kalamazoo is a terrible place to see stars. There's way too much light pollution. If you go about 30 minutes to an hour north of Grand Rapids  you start to see a clear skies again.
kzoo,3awzyi,ElBeartoe,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:31:20 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  When I first came to Kalamazoo (about 432 years ago... lol) from a much smaller town on the Lake, I was severely disappointed in the light pollution (and the lack of the Lake).    I had a good friend and we'd drive out into the surrounding area every Tuesday night... it was a ritual, and we'd try to get lost on purpose just to see what was out there around here.  No matter how far we drove or in what direction, one could always get outta the car and find Kalamazoo in the darkness just by looking for that yellow glowing halo in the distance.  But... if you want to see the night sky, instead of driving north of GR, go south towards Schoolcraft.  There's a preserve off WU Avenue right here.  It's a dirt road leading back into acre after acre of preserved farmland, and it's a great place to go star-gazing.  10 minutes from Kalamazoo on 131.    If, for some reason the DNR has the gate shut, there's a public park 1/4 mile east up the road.  Or just park in the little lot, hop the gate and hike in.  If you follow the dirt road long enough you get a gorgeous lake and the whole place is beautiful."

If you do plan to head out to the lake, just be prepared.  Saint Joe and South Haven (I dont know about Holland) get EXTREMELY busy.  And I do mean extremely.  Just plan accordingly and get there early to find a place to park.  It also takes awhile to leave.  I've personally never been too thrilled with Kalamazoo for the 4th when I lived there.  I always left for somewhere else.  I grew up in Grand Rapids and they have very awesome fireworks, but that can get busy as well.  If you are trying to make a good impression, I'd go to the Lake.  I know South Haven has AWESOME fireworks and it would be less than a 90 minute drive for you.  I don't know how old anyone is and what you are all into, but the Lake is never a bad idea in July."

kzoo,3a7jxi,tway_with_it,3,Thu Jun 18 13:22:41 2015 UTC,"Ugh. I sympathize with this. I'd like to share a story of my own.  In 2010, I had a sales job working for a really cool company.  However, I was depressed and I was living alone which caused me to feel isolated and i spiraled deeper into depression. My own self deprication caused me to fail at my job and I lost it. I decided it was time for a major change. I sold most of my belongings. The only thing of value that I kept was my moped. Shortly after my unemployment, I spontaneously decided to ride my moped to visit Mammoth Caves in Kentucky.   The journey took 3 and 1/2 days and 45 hours of riding. I rode alone, but I met some interesting people along the way and I fell completely in love with my moped. That summer I found a part time, minimum wage job and some generous people who gave me a great deal on a bedroom to rent.  and I learned everything about how to work on that moped. It was the only thing that gave me happiness that summer.  One morning in August, I awoke to find that my moped, the only thing of value that I owned and the only thing that I cared about, had been stolen.  It doesn't seem like that big of a deal from an outside perspective.  The person who took it had no idea what that machine meant to me.  It wasn't a spiteful insult against me, it was just thoughtless thievery.  I guess I don't know where I'm going with this, haha, but I just wanted to share my experience and thoughts. Being stolen from sucks!"
kzoo,3a7jxi,theforerunner343,2,Thu Jun 18 17:02:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there are some sucky people out there.  I had a good portion of my container garden destroyed this year when someone decided to topple over my greenhouse shelf.  And yes, it was intentional - they pushed it away from the wall, turned it 90 degrees, then shoved it over.  Worst part was that all of the plants that my sons had picked out and grown from seeds - the ones they were so excited about - were among those destroyed."

No offense to the good people of Kalamazoo, I have met some great people. but man in general Michiganders, get it together.  Just a few examples, about a month ago we had some people shoot up a house down the street because someone said bad things about his mamma. My neighbor thinks I'm a racist because we called the cops cause he was drunk and stopping cars in the street, and today I watched some dude open his car door and just throw his garbage out on the street, maybe I just don't get it? This shit happens constantly, hands down worst place I have lived. I'm sure many will disagree, but this is my experience so far. I think it's a rust belt thing."

kzoo,3a5i2y,ScheisseWurst,0,Wed Jun 17 17:39:34 2015 UTC,"Sidewalk riding is very dangerous —  you are invisible when on sidewalks!  Motorists are looking in the road and not for sidewalk traﬃc moving at high speeds such as bicyclists. They often don’t see bicyclists there, especially at driveways and intersections. Sidewalks themselves pose dangers to bicy-clists. Poor maintenance, uneven surfaces, gaps, and pedestrians make side-walks diﬃcult and dangerous for bicycles to navigate.Bicyclists are never required to use sidewalks or side paths.     I assume it's similar to sidewalks in that it's more dangerous to ride on them than in the actual road.    Source: Page 8 here"

Now let's see this comment reach -40 without the bandwagon of cyclists from r/bicycle here. Y'know, just the citizens of Kalamazoo.

And my guess is that you're not a cyclist.    Not one single goddamn inch, take it from a guy who's lived in cycle-happy wastelands.

I don't feel like dragging this out to the point that I prove you wrong and you delete your comments and downvote everything out of spite, so I'll let you pass on this one, most every snarky commenter has retracted their non-sense about 10 comments after they admit that they do what I said they do.  The idea of dedicated bike lanes would be good if they were used for proper intentions, but you give cyclists a lane and the ""legit Xx420xX_pro_cyclists"" will see it as a bunny hill of sorts and intentionally do all their practice runs on the road instead as a way of elevating their status above the normal cyclists who would use the bike lanes.   It's happened before, I've seen it. And even though the argument of the majority of cyclists here are ""this never happens because we were watching you your whole life"", I can assure you it's happened. And if we let it happen here too, the only thing to stop it would be the lack of funding.   You know how a large concentration of liquor stores and low concentration of police stations in a given area generates crime? Notice how the more crosswalks a city has, the more likely it is to get jaywalkers in a counter-productive result? Well picture long expanses of bike path, with a bunch of cyclists who never learned to stop at signs or red lights. Picture a whole generation of people who never learned to look both ways before crossing a street.

kzoo,3a5i2y,TotesMessenger,8,Wed Jun 17 16:53:23 2015 UTC,"BIKING ON THE STREETS INSTEAD OF THE FUCKING DEDICATED LANES BUILT JUST FOR THEIR LAWBREAKING ASSES.    Must a bicyclist ride in a bike lane or a side path?   The MVC does not require bicyclists to use bike lanes, even if present. In 2006 Section 257.660 (3) of the MVC was amended, removing ""bicyclists"" from being required to use side paths.    Just FYI, you're wrong"
kzoo,3a5i2y,spacetalking,-4,Wed Jun 17 17:35:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah exactly that reason, being an asshole despite the bike paths being made for convenience/safety.   Kinda like how I drive slow in the fast lane cuz like, it's not against the law maaaan~ so fuck courtesy, I'm a goddamn cyclist so I can be an asshole by law~."
kzoo,3a5i2y,CRIZZLEC_ECHO,0,Thu Jun 18 02:29:52 2015 UTC,"Exactly what reason? I was pointing that it is not illegal for them to ride in the street despite the presence of bike lanes. While this is not always the most convenient for cars, it is sometimes useful and necessary for cyclists. Especially on Oakland Dr. where there is a dedicated bike lane, it is often blocked by debris, runners, or parked cars (usually busses and mail trucks)."
kzoo,3a5i2y,spacetalking,-1,Thu Jun 18 06:58:41 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I drive slow in the fast lane because they're typically the first ones to get fixed by construction, so me choking up traffic by not using my dedicated lane for slower movement is totally unobstructive.   Just because it's legal doesn't mean it's not a dick move to do it. This is the problem with cyclists once we reach ""private citizen using truck to block off both lanes of traffic for cyclist practice on major road way"". Inch by Inch the more we let cyclists be assholes, the more they'll want to be assholes.   You can be a Martyr for your cyclist pals if you want, and the guy that ran you over will typically get the manslaughter conviction even if you were running a red while he was in the green. But while you're a pancake getting scraped off the road, the guy that hit you will be alive and kickin'."
kzoo,3a5i2y,CRIZZLEC_ECHO,2,Thu Jun 18 13:56:56 2015 UTC,"Let's break this down (despite it seeming futile based upon your unwillingness to actually discuss things and to only spew vitriol and accusations) and try to find some common ground.     THEIR LAWBREAKING ASSES     Your quote, not mine, which I debunked based on Michigan law. So now we've established that it is not illegal to ride outside the lane.     While this is not always the most convenient for cars, it is sometimes useful and necessary for cyclists.    My quote, which you did not refute, because it is a valid and legitimate statement of reason.    Just because it's legal doesn't mean it's not a dick move to do it.    This is actually a true statement. But it doesn't negate my prior point about it being necessary to ride outside the bike lane.  It is only an attempt by you to somehow gain the higher moral ground by somehow applying a label that all cyclists are 'dicks' because they perform an action of which you disapprove.   Inch by Inch the more we let cyclists be assholes, the more they'll want to be assholes.    This is what is commonly referred to as logical fallacy. It is not useful for either arguing or debating as it gives your argument no merit.     and the guy that ran you over will typically get the manslaughter conviction even if you were running a red while he was in the green     This is off-topic and not related at all to my point. But let's explore it for a minute since you brought it up in an attempt to relegate cyclists to a lower standing. The presumption that the person who was in the green will get a manslaughter conviction is not backed up by any data or proof. [citation needed] as it were. The follow-up question then becomes would the same thing happen if two cars are involved in a similar collision. Is the result different or the same?"

I suppose the real question of all of this, the one that really entertains me, is why have none of the pro-cyclists addressed the ""farce"" of breaking the law when they see fit?

kzoo,39jlvr,Arogyth,5,Fri Jun 12 04:35:39 2015 UTC,"Hey!  Couple places to check out:  Kalamazoo Public Library - get your card and get some books!  It's a really nice library, and don't miss the bookstore on the lower level, it's a treasure trove.  Kazoo Books - On Parkview, good independent book shop.  That's my neighborhood.  While you're over there, check out Bacchus for beer / wine and great cheese and stuff, and the Oakwood Plaza has food - Oakwood Bistro is fantastic, Sewall's Health food, and a great little Asian grocery Pacific Rim.  Klassic Arcade - A must.  15 minutes outta town, for $5 you can play classic coin-ops all day long!  Fanfare Comics - Kzoo's comic / card / boardgame mecca.  Worth a visit even if you don't comic.  KIA - Art museum / gallery.  Fantastic place to hang out.  There's a shit ton more to see and do in Kzoo.  Downtown festival season is starting, so food / music etc. every weekend at Arcadia Fest site.    Alamo Drafthouse theater downtown shows a weird selection of films, plus you can eat dinner while you watch.  Tons of hiking/biking/geocaching areas if you google a bit, and at least two disc golf courses (probably more by now).  If you like fishing, reply here, and I'll point you to the secret ultra spots to do so.  This town's got a lot of heart, you just gotta poke around!"

I was in grad school for a year trying out an Optics program, but decided to drop it.  Where is this hackerspace?  I'm a big fan of music.   I enjoy driving around and seeing things.  When I was up at Tech I did some geocaching with friends, but I find that I'm not really motivated to do it by myself, it's more fun to go out and do it when someone else is hugely motivated to do it.  I play some games, but I want to be more active now that I'm down state.    I think I've kind of not figured out how to adult yet.  I don't know what I want to do for hobbies really.  I like being around people, but I'm fairly introverted most of the time, so it's kind of hard to make friends.  I'm not much for bars (too loud, most of the time)"

kzoo,39dqqh,pasportit,2,Thu Jun 11 01:58:11 2015 UTC,"The Vine neighborhood sounds like it might be a good bet for you. There are parties here and there but overall, it isn't too bad and it's within walking distance of downtown, though you'd probably want to either have a car or check the bus routes to get out to the engineering campus. Check out http://www.kalamazoorent.com .  I don't know much about the different landlords in that area, other than to say you might want to stay away from Lukeman (no experience myself, but I've had friends who said it took Lukeman several days to fix the heat and hot water in the winter among other complaints). I rented from Mibec Investments for several years and could not have been happier with the condition of my apartment, and how quickly repairs were done when I needed them."
kzoo,39dqqh,faydaletraction,3,Thu Jun 11 14:05:28 2015 UTC,I'd also say stay away from Hickory Management.  I never rented from them but we did check out a few of their apartments and they were god awful. You could tell some hadn't been lived in for a while and they made no effort to even attempt to make the apartments look livable.  They also have a weird lease and we were told things that were different from what was in the lease.  (This was three years ago so maybe they changed.  Just beware.)

I obviously have not moved into my room yet, but was pretty impressed with the friendliness/honesty of the staff. The apartment I looked at was alright - not exactly something I was wowed with but pretty good for the price range. I also liked that it was an honest representation of the room vs. a showroom. I looked at a few before deciding. Also, although somewhat old, the reviews on ApartmentRatings looked good.  Just a note: I don't think the staff responds to emails that are submitted into their site, but they are good about phone calls."
kzoo,397e01,smgpenguin,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:24:57 2015 UTC,"That was kind of my impression. It hopefully will be my last apartment in the area so I want to save a little bit of money. I am not expecting anything luxurious, but I at least would like to feel safe."
kzoo,397e01,smgpenguin,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:34:32 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I've been to the apartments around half a dozen times and have never felt unsafe and didn't see any shady characters in the area. I haven't been there at night yet though."

They keep telling me that they're not sure who is moving out, so they can't have me sign a lease for a specific room, but that they're positive they will have an apartment for me. I might just be paranoid, but it seems kind of sketchy that they won't put my lease agreement in writing, and I was wondering if anyone else was experiencing this/had experienced this in the past."
kzoo,397e01,smgpenguin,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:24:59 2015 UTC,I haven't yet. I paid my deposit a few months ago but I don't plan to move in until August.

Kendra and Gina (office staff) are both great. The maintenance guys are also great and quick to respond. One of them lives on property, or did when I lived there. I'd live there again in a heartbeat. Let me know if you've got any questions.   Note: this was all 3 years ago, I'm not sure how it's faired since then."
kzoo,397e01,HalfRho,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:26:30 2015 UTC,"I have lived there 2011-2013. It was a quieter apartment (depends building to building I suppose). The fire alarms were tripped twice in the almost 2 years I was there. It wasn't a glitch, just occupants burning their dinner and part of their kitchen and the firefighters arrived to give the broads a lesson on how and when to use the fire extinguisher. The management was nice to me. The washer and dryers used a pay card system, not quarters. It was the best apartment I've lived in that was close to Parkview campus. Riding your bike to class shouldn't be a problem if that's your thing."
kzoo,397e01,diyorgasms,0,Sun Jun 14 02:35:55 2015 UTC,"I've been inside a unit. It's pretty run down and outdated.  Also, there is a subsidized housing complex across Stadium. I don't want to make any assumptions about this particular complex, but subsidized housing complexes often are accompanied by higher crime rates."
kzoo,397e01,diyorgasms,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:13:07 2015 UTC,"Hmmmm, the tour they took they showed us a unit they are currently renovating, so that is a little concerning. As far as I know they aren't subsidized, at least judging by their application, it was a lot more in depth than anywhere else I have seen. When you say run down, can you elaborate?"

Alamo is absolutely great and they serve you while you are watching a movie! I just went there for the first time recently. Beer Exchange is a good place to spend awhile at...definitely stay long enough to experience a ""market crash"" where all the beer prices drop super cheap. Oh and Rupert's is amazing as well. They have good beer and the place itself is really quirky and unique. Gonzo's has amazing food and their vanilla porter is one of my favorite beers....but really, the food there is great.

They are a company that buys energy and resells it. They sell it at a higher price than you are paying now, but not as high as ""they"" project energy to cost in the future. They promise to keep your bill steady while consumers can raise and lower based on cost. Essentially they are banking on energy cost staying low enough that they continue to profit off you (you paying them more than they pay for the energy). If energy happens to go up in price they have to eat it and lose money.   When would it be worth signing with them? If we expected a major surge in the cost of energy. As energy has stayed low over the last ~15 years they have been around, it's most likely a waste of $."

kzoo,38uv3r,xTomBx,2,Mon Jun 8 10:30:17 2015 UTC,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. Will never check this account again, don't expect any replies.  Here's my take on the situation. I've worked for Allen Edwin. This is first-hand experience speaking.  1) They have plats all over southern michigan, from GR clear across to Detroit. Hundreds of them. A plat is neighborhood(s) worth of homes, dozens and dozens of residents. They are the biggest home builder in Michigan. And you are one person, buying one (from the sounds of it low-end home), in one plat. You are going to be on the bottom of the priority totem-pole. They do houses for $80k and houses for $400k+. Everything you see with them in regards to service and quality is comparible with the experience you may have with a large telecom. Roll the dice and maybe everythings great. If it's not, good luck!  You could buy a home from them and it might be wonderful and run into no big problems. You could also buy a home from them and end up in a total shit-show. I'm being optimistic because I have no doubt it runs the gamut, and construction companies that only ever build awful homes aren't going to survive, so there must be some reasonable percentage that don't fall apart immediately..  2) the blue collar people they will be sending out to address any problems you have will not give one flying fuck. At all. They will be looking to do the absolute minimum, find the quickest and dirtiest solution to shut you up so they can move on to the next crisis. If it's not an industry specific problem like plumbing or electrical that requires a license to do work and inspections before/during/after, you will at best get a full-time maintenance man out there. Likely you'll get a temp-hire, college kid working over the summer type of situation. Expect it to take a while. I went out to fix absolutely legitimate problems, caused entirely by AE & AE contractors, where people had been calling for months and months. Both inside and outside of homes. Cheap homes and expensive homes. And when a worker goes out to fix a problem they are under constant pressure to put that fire out as fast as possible and move on to the next fire, quality be damned.  The people at the bottom of the ladder are treated like shit (literally, fuckin' awful). So after time they end up with only drop-outs and shit-eaters, people whose only purpose is to suck up to management or drive around in the truck for 2 months until school starts again. People whose options are limited because they can't work full-time or have such a shit record they have to take whatever the temp agency will give them. Everybody else quits, moves on to better companies, etc.  3) the contractors (trades) they have working on your future home will vary TREMENDOUSLY depending on where you are located. The kalamazoo area where they started is not what I would consider ""high quality"", but it's far better than Lansing, and that's better still than Detroit (shudder... the things I've seen contractors do in Detroit...). At least in Kalamazoo they have reasonably solid relationships with their trades people, inspectors, etc. So they can get shit done in a reasonable time-frame. I've seen brownstone plats in Lansing (brownstones are homes built on some kind of polluted ground) that have sat unfinished for years just due to various bureaucracy.  4) The home-buying process they have is similar to say buying a new cell phone at the Verizon store or buying a website from GoDaddy. That base price is the hook.. literally four walls and a roof, some cheap carpet a sink and a toilet n' tub. Oh you wanted a lawn? Yeah they own a separate company that does lawns. You wanted a proper kitchen, an automatic garage door, a garbage disposal, a granite counter-top, tile flooring, nice carpet, an entry door that weighs more than 10 lbs. and on and on. Welcome to the UPSELL show.  5) AHOY HOA!! Home owners associations. Virtually all their plats have HOA's, and if you buy a house you're buying into that show. Typically they start the HOA, and as they finish the plat they ""sell"" the HOA (shift the burden basically) onto the home-owners, so they can become hands off. See they buy big, cheap plots of land and then develop a big neighborhood, a lot of times 5 miles out of town.  They'll put in the water/sewer/electric, streets, etc. and then start selling plots and building out the neighborhood. The HOA they start manages the common grounds (courtyards, ponds, swimming pool, trash containers). You get to pay for that, when you buy a house. In fees, forever. HOA not doing it's job? Those blue collar guys fucking off and not weeding the flowerbeds, not picking up the garbage, swimming pool full of pondscum? Yeah good luck getting any bang out of your buck on the H.O.A fees. Those are the same guys miserably running from one fire to the next, or finding somewhere shady to park the truck and snooze a while.  6) Resale. Resale on those homes can be brutal. Maybe you get a good house, and the neighborhood turns out to be nice, or you are tooth and nail and you force them to hold up their end of the contract to a T. Or maybe you get a house with problems, or some bad neighbors, or a HOA that gets about as much done as congress. Granted bad neighbors and houses with problems can occur anywhere, but in this situation you're now one person fighting against a behemoth of a company to get relief. If you buy a home from another individual, and it has undisclosed issues you often have more legal leverage and if it comes to a fight you should be on far more even footing.  If you're after a cheaper home, my personal suggestion is to first spend at least a month looking at different places daily to acclimate yourself to the market, and also to check out the HUD homes, craigslist, zillow, etc. There's massive amounts of information regarding local real estate for sale online, you can often rule a place out before you ever make an appointment to look inside. If you buy a HUD, whatever you SEE that needs fixing, calculate the cost generously and expect to at least double or triple it for the stuff you & the inspector can't see/inspect. HUD has a program to bundle repair costs into your mortgage.  Every house will lack something, you have to start somewhere, and much of the value in a home can come from the location, not the home itself (homes depreciate, land appreciates). If you buy something you can afford (don't end up losing to the bank) you're far better off building equity paying a mortgage off than paying someone else's mortgage off by renting.  And the last thing I will say is no matter what option you choose, spend the money (expect $200-300) for a professional housing inspector to spend 2 or 3 hours looking over every detail of the house before you commit an offer. Seems expensive but a house payment or two in inspection fees is nothing compared to buying a house with $20000 in repairs you didn't account for ahead of time.  End of rant, best of luck to you!"
kzoo,38uv3r,askelfjsefiijfke,2,Mon Jun 8 17:59:49 2015 UTC,"I know you will not read this and I thank you for your truthful comments.   I was looking in Kzoo/Portage. With a base price of a T2200 @ 196k. And then adding another 25k or more in upgrades.  I straight up asked AE why people are so negative of the build quality and etc. Their response is they build to code essentially - and in addition to that there is maintenance that is needed. So you have to accept you don't know how they maintain the house.  And with the # of houses they build, I can probably accept a few houses with some more than minor issues. And a lot of houses with minor issues, but the service response time you mention is appalling.   AE Homes, sounds like the Walmart of homes. I felt their garage doors (a bit thicker than aluminum foil at least). I knocked on random dry wall pieces - pretty hollow/thin it seems.  When it comes to all the things you want in a house - the AE homes come in at a price point that you can't often find. In that $170-225 price range - there is a minimal amount of inventory - and I have seen houses I did like on the MLS market - but they are getting snatched up with quick. Like you need to walk in ready to do a bidding war.  I will have to think about this more.  I wish I could see just how much the upgrades cost.....all of them.

kzoo,38uv3r,bbqturtle,-1,Thu Jun 11 06:40:00 2015 UTC,"We (my parents when i lived at home) built an Allen Edwin home and also bought a used model. They lived there around 3 years and 3 years I believe.  It was a fantastic experience. Living in a brand new home is amazing, and with the warranty they will fix everything that's wrong. They sold the houses for about the same price as they bought them, so they only lost out on the interest rate on their mortgage.   The neighborhoods are usually some of the nicer neighborhoods you can live in with upper middle class families and curated parks and freshly paved trails.   Even used, they seem to hold their general niceness because they are still new-ish.  Cons:  Expensive. New houses can be pricey.   Build quality - yes, they build everything as cheap as they can. However, codes do exist. Did they over build anything? No. Did they underbuild anything? Maybe.  But they will fix it within warranty, and it might be something like faulty siding, not something important like HVAc.   The biggest problem and con about the home is how they nickles and dime you. They have houses starting at 75k, right. Amazing deal. Except, the base house doesn't have a double sink in the kitchen, has a low quality carpet and low quality fixtures and no light in the garage and square sidewalk steps.   Somehow you have to upgrade up from base model. You have to. Soon you'll be choosing the counter tops and the siding color and the siding style (one line or two?) because you want to maximize resale value while conserving money but it costs so much initially.   Also, the houses are extremely cookie cutter. I remember walking into the neighbors house and their house being the same layout with the stairs and family room and kitchen island as ours.   This is if you build it. They really do seem quite nice, and just because something isn't over built doesn't mean it's not nice. A used Allen Edwin is much nicer for a middle class family than any other housing in kalamazoo is my guess. They are cheap but they are new."

I've seen many pitts/pitt mixes back there at the county shelter. At the very least, she will be kept the holding period.   After you take her to the county shelter, you can contact the SPCA about her, and then hope they rescue her once the holding period is up. They really seem to like the better behaved ones, so I bet its a pretty strong possibility that the SPCA would take her from the county shelter.

Asylum Lake mentioned above is a good choice.  On the east side you might look at Fred Mclindon trail off H Ave. It's about a 2 mile loop with one big uphill climb. Near that is also The Chipman Preserve off East main I believe. You'll see some dog walkers and hikers but it's usually not much used. Supposedly has about 6 miles of criss-crossing trails. It's nice."
kzoo,385mcv,BreathingEnthusiast,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:46:51 2015 UTC,Asylum lake is actually close to where I work.  Thanks!  (I'm looking for places to run too xD)
kzoo,385mcv,ChibiLlama,3,Tue Jun 2 12:53:21 2015 UTC,"As well as Asylum Lake, there is also Al Sabo. It can be a little harder to find, but it has plenty of parking. You can either park at KVCC (by the ATC) and enter through the dirt road path there, or there is also parking right by Roto Kiwan Boy Scout's camp. Just make sure you don't go on to the camp's land, they get very upset about that. The turn off is just a dirt/gravel driveway with no markings, so you may have to turn around once or twice to get it, but it is right next door to the camp.  Plus Portage itself has a ton of larger parks, so you could probably go digging for trails in those as well."
kzoo,385mcv,noribun,3,Tue Jun 2 03:11:52 2015 UTC,"I run at the Al Sabo land preserve - I know there is a lot, but I have never used it since I live right next to it. You can probably park in the Saddle Creek lot, and take the trail into it from there. There is rarely anyone else out there, and if I see someone, they are running too. I'm in horrible shape, and probably look stupid running, but it's the middle of the woods, it's beautiful, and I'm getting myself in better shape."
kzoo,385mcv,jrohlfing,2,Tue Jun 2 12:26:54 2015 UTC,"The Kal-Haven trail, starting out on 10th street is one option. It is mainly hard-packed dirt from an old railroad grade, but works well for running.   You could also try the KRVT, in Parchment you can park near the post office at Riverview and Mosel and run along the river for quite ways--out to the nature center.  The Portage Bicentennial Park Trail is also a good choice. There are several places you can park--there is a parking lot for the trail at Kilgore and Lovers Lane, another park entrance between Westnedge and Lovers Lane on Milham and it ends at the Portage Library."

kzoo,385mcv,disco_sweat,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:43:35 2015 UTC,"I was going to suggest Kleinstuck as well. For just getting into running, it's a convenient places to get started. I've parked either where Chevy Chase meets the trail, or at the YMCA. It's basically one big loop (half mile?) so you can just keep going around until you're done without having too far to go to get back to your car.   http://www.fm.wmich.edu/index.php/download_file/-/2133  (I wouldn't worry about the private trails marked on that map - just follow the loop)"
kzoo,385mcv,cbsteven,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:58:52 2015 UTC,"I like Kleinstuck a lot, although they recently put a coating of loose gravel on it that makes it a bit annoying to run on. The loop is exactly 1km (0.62mi) long, which is a convenient coincidence."

kzoo,385n6w,bbqturtle,2,Wed Jun 3 05:37:58 2015 UTC,"Hunan Gardens feels very chinese in their setting, in the nice service and quiet atmosphere. However, the majority of their menu is still Americanized chinese food. They do have their authentic menu, but those are mostly noodle dishes. If you want something meat based but authentic you have to look somewhere else. I go for lunch sometimes because of the nice setting. I bring my kindle.  The Sichuan restaurant across the street has an authentic menu and an american menu just like Hunan, and a few of their menu items are closer to what I'd consider authentic. But, they don't have the highest quality ingredients. Some of their flavors are great though and it's worth one visit, but I got a buffet-hibatchi-stir-fry-as-you-wait feel from the two dishes I've tried. I've been here twice just to try it, probably won't go back.  Chinn Chinns doesn't serve authentic Chinese food, but they do have fresh, high quality ingredients, where the owner has met the butcher or fisher and gets the meats fresh and high-quality. The steak, pork, and chicken is all so rediculously tender I couldn't cook something better at home. Their sauces are rich and full of flavor. To my tastes, they are better than most authentic chinese because of the vibrancy of the dishes. I have never had a dish here that I didn't like, but it is busy and loud, sometimes with a long wait. Feel free to go next door to main st pub to grab a drink (no food!) while you wait for your table. I go here for all special occasians.  Rasa Ria is malaysian. When most americans want chinese food, they really mean asian food and don't know the difference between any food west of hawaii and east of india. Rasa Ria is delicious curries and fried rice, with yummy little pancakes. I highly recommend their Beef Rendang, interesting spices. Hardly any seating though, it's really better for carry out. They also have a pulled tea where the hot water is pulled through the tea leaves, which ends up being more like a chai latte. I highly recommend this place and the family, but you'll need to call ahead occassionally to make sure they are at their restaurant. Sometimes they take random vacation days. I go here when I want good takeout.  Joy Fong in portage is really far away and I've only been there once but it was good and the chinese professor at WMU said they had the most authentic chinese food and he was from china. It was pretty good all around, but didn't have anything really exciting or different for me, all of the sauces seemed just very slightly muted. That's probably how it's supposed to be, but I would prefer something that will catch my tounge like a curry or anything at chinn chinn. It's too far away for me to go often."

Their pupu platter is good if you like dumplings.   They have very good lunch specials too, like around 10-12$ for a main and a few sides (can include their amazing soup), but they are closed mondays and don't do lunch on saturday or sunday I think."

Some do rush screen print orders, but charge you a ton for it.   You can also go the DIY route pretty easily. Print your design on wax paper, cut it out with an xacto, then iron it on to the shirt. From there you can spray paint or brush on your ink. It can be a pain making several designs that way.   I'd you know anybody with a vinyl plotter, you can get iron on vinyl at Michael's or Joann and have them cut the design for you.

And, I came in (on purpose) wearing somewhat dirty, not nice work clothes. I do this to see if they'll just think, ""Oh this guy is just wasting my time he has no money"" or whatever. Guy didn't miss a beat. I was sad to hear he wasn't there a few months later.  I had one issue when I went in for my 10,000 mile service. The guy at the counter just...wasn't very responsive. If I recall right I asked a question and was basically ignored. HOWEVER; VW sends these surveys after a service, I filled it out, explained what happened. Maple Hill see's them, and reads them. I got an apology and explanation within a day or two, personally, from the fella I dealt with. While it should not have happened in the first place, I understand people have bad days, I have them myself and I work in a service related business. The fact that they apologized means a lot to me, a lot of places would just say, ""Oh well F that guy who cares.""

The first Friday in July and September will be going into Independence Day and Labor Day weekends, so Art Hop is moved to the second Friday in those months.  This sometimes also happens to the January Art Hop, because of New Years Day.  The June Art Hop used to be expanded, but it has been reduced due to the overwhelming number of June Jubilee activities, particularly the expansion of the KIA Art Fair to Friday and the addition of Art on the Mall.  So, they moved the expanded Art Hop to May to coincide with Kalamazoo Marathon weekend.  When I think of the July and August Art Hops, there are not that many official stops, but there are large numbers of unaffiliated street musicians and artists working the Kalamazoo Mall, more than you will see at any other time of the year."

Access to a handful of bars, restaurants,  and boutiques that close early relative to larger cities, and a sorta decent view. You don't get cafes unless you count water street or black owl as being down town; you don't get any groceries;  nothing twenty-four hour. The reason people pay more to live in smaller places in downtown areas is because they get access to all kinds of amenities, services, and entertainment without having to get in their car. Kzoo doesn't have that yet."
kzoo,37elrq,ArMcK,5,Wed May 27 08:59:02 2015 UTC,"Well... Walgreens isn't that far of a walk.  Alamo has special movie selections pretty much every day.  In the summer you wouldn't need to worry about parking for festivals or art hop. The entertainment 'district' (monaco bay, wild bull, and skydeck) are right there. Irvings is on the mall, they have food stuff there (don't know about price).  I don't know, I think there's tons of neat stuff to do in downtown kalamazoo.  The cost of living increase is pretty huge, though. You'll not only be spending on rent, but you'll also be spending more for just about everything else. Depending on the prices at irvings there really isn't a cheap place to buy food.   It would be super expensive"

There are bars all over town. Sure, they may have more floor space to dance, but 99% of the reason to go there is to drink and try to hook up. It's not special."
kzoo,37elrq,ArMcK,1 point,Wed May 27 17:03:32 2015 UTC,I think it might be a classier crowd than most of the other bars around town with the exception of bells and maybe the beer exchange.  Definitely better than wayside west or the library.
kzoo,37elrq,FlintGrey,3,Wed May 27 20:17:31 2015 UTC,"I agree, and I think Kalamazoo is trying really hard to be that place where the downtown core is a really desirable place where people want to be, but it isn't there yet.  We really need a couple more markets and grocery stores, and some more restaurants that don't close when the business day ends. Portage does the chain, Applebee's, suburbia thing really well, Kalamazoo needs to do the hip urban thing well so they both play to their strengths.  And as you mentioned, people pay more for a smaller space so that they can walk everywhere and not worry about a car or parking, but Kalamazoo has plentiful parking, using a car here isn't as much of a pain as it is in many other places. The only time it's difficult is during major festivals and events downtown, and even then it isn't that bad."
kzoo,37elrq,WolvJS,2,Wed May 27 19:35:09 2015 UTC,"Kalamazoo/Portage; for a city of our size, I would like to think that Portage itself needs their own drive-thru Starbucks. Downtown Kalamazoo with WMU/Zoetis/foot traffic (especially during festivals) could probably sustain another Starbucks too I bet. They seem to be a good starting point for the kind of foot traffic you want in these areas.  It might not be original or cutting edge hipster, but it is once again a start.  Also - as I have learned, I believe across from Burdicks, there is a new multi-purpose building being built. Not sure how many floors, but they are already trying to lease/sell spaces in the place. I believe it will be where the parking lot is now (Across from burdicks).  I would be interested to hear what gets developed in there, specifically in regards to the kinds of shops you are looking for. I keep thinking that Kalamazoo or Grand Rapids could probably provide enough demand for a brazilian churrascaria place.   If residential rent is a indication of commercial rental space downtown - it is no surprise that there are not a lot of places focusing on moving downtown. As everyone seems to agree - Kalamazoo isn't a place that should be able to demand $1300-1400 for a 900-1100 square foot apartment with above average furnishings. So for businesses to pay a premium for space down there - seems like a tough sell.   There just isn't enough of foot traffic to say that being downtown is beneficial for your business (this isn't downtown GR where there are hundreds if not thousands of businesses in our downtown district)."
kzoo,37elrq,PasturesOfPlenty,3,Thu May 28 00:05:14 2015 UTC,"This is an example of what you are going to get for $1400/mo downtown. This may be surprising to you, but these places are pretty in demand it seems. So in demand, they are building a new building.  http://downtownkalamazoo.org/Live-Here/Available-Space/Available-Space-Detail.aspx?AvailableSpaceId=244  I was honestly surprised to see those prices, but the price of a not-crappy apartment around here seems to have that price tag associated with it. The alternatives are not as appealing, which are to;  1) Rent a house. Downside = most houses you rent are old and crappy  2) Rent another crappy apartment from Edward Rose or some other place.  You are right that it sucks we don't have a Starbucks or a grocery downtown."
kzoo,37elrq,ArMcK,4,Wed May 27 14:39:58 2015 UTC,I lived 2 houses down from that for $400/mo including utilities as some perspective.
kzoo,37elrq,cbsteven,3,Wed May 27 16:46:12 2015 UTC,"Also, what's the basis for claiming there's demand? Is there a waiting list of people who are just itching to pay those prices? Kzoo is a ghost of a factory town with a decent size academic industry (they mostly live in single family homes on the east side), a growing craft brew industry (probably living in the same area) that hasn't reached larger brew town status, and almost no medical or tech industry which is what attracts 20/30 something year old single adults with money to burn, i.e. the demographic you're targeting to fill those pricey downtown units.   We have a good town. It has a LOT of potential, but it's still just potential. Those buildings aren't going to achieve full occupancy for  ten years. You're putting the carriage cart before the horse. Attract the industry to attract the demographic, then those units will get filled.   Edit: Also, round out the downtown attractions so there's more to do than eat and drink. Millennial young professionals want more to do."
kzoo,37elrq,FlintGrey,2,Wed May 27 17:13:56 2015 UTC,At any given time there are only a handful of downtown apartments unoccupied. The demand for downtown living has been well-established for a few years now.

They're doing a lot of innovating lately into tech fields, especially with the whole aca and meaningful use stuff coming down the pipeline.  Our hospitals are top notch places to work.  There isn't that much in terms of tech, but there are a couple of places that are growing.  In particular maestro, streamline healtchare solutions (i work there right now), humanX, Zoetis are all downtown.  Plus the medical school at western."

Not to put too fine a point on it, but it keeps out the riffraff.  I was poor some years back and rented a house for $600/month and split it with 3 other guys in their late teens/early 20s.  Guess how shitty of neighbors we were and guess how frequently we threw loud parties?  People in $1300 1br apartments do not throw ragers, ever.  If the location, quality of the furnishings, and quality/cleanliness of the building are important to you and you can afford it, it probably makes sense."

kzoo,36vy2y,theforerunner343,4,Fri May 22 15:34:36 2015 UTC,"It doesn't cost charter extra to give you 5mb vs 60 mb. In fact, all customers that paid $40/month for 30mb recently just got a free upgrade to 60mb.  Do I need that? No. No, not at all. Would I pay extra for that? No. But charter is also the cheapest, most reliable, best provider in the area. I could choose between at&t and charter, and at&t had hasle with using the phone line, setting up the phone line, paying for a crappy old modem or trying to get a modem that was compatible, etc.  40/month is so, so much nicer than a lot of places in USA where they pay upwards of $100 for 15mb. I'm very very happy with them. However, they will send you a request for you to add more services every month. (landline and tv in their ""bundle"" that costs $90 or something)."
kzoo,36vy2y,bbqturtle,2,Fri May 22 17:59:55 2015 UTC,This all makes sense. I just haven't paid for internet since 2008 and back then it was $20/month if you signed for 6 months. I'm also annoyed that there seems to be no option for me other than Charter.

kzoo,36vy2y,diyorgasms,3,Fri May 22 23:35:28 2015 UTC,"I use the Charter 60mb internet at my house. One thing to remember is at that price you are also getting the modem for free. Most other ISP's in the area are going to charge you a monthly fee to rent their modem. So even if you could get AT&T or someone else, be prepared to tack an extra $5-10 onto the bill for that. IMO $40/mo for 60mb high speed internet is a bargain. I've downloaded 2.5gb HD movie files in under 5 min & in 4 years I've never had an outage longer than a few minutes."
kzoo,36vy2y,HamDiesel,2,Fri May 22 17:47:12 2015 UTC,"Charter used to have introductory rates for their broadband of $25/month, maybe try looking for that, and go to retention to fight when they try to raise your rates after a year.  Also, 3Mbps is not really good enough to stream in high definition. I would look at least for 8-10Mbps, then you can multitask and stream. I think you underestimate just how shitty 3Mbps is. For reference, the FCC just reclassified broadband as 25Mbps down."
kzoo,36vy2y,StDoodle,2,Fri May 22 15:51:01 2015 UTC,"When I spoke to them on the phone I said many times that I didn't want to pay more than $30 and that I was going to get services elsewhere and they wouldn't budge on the price. Maybe I am underestimating 3mb. One of the previous places I lived, my roommate had a DSL connection that I speed tested at average ~1.5mb down and we could stream netflix just fine 1 user at a time, but I probably should aim higher than that, I guess."
kzoo,36vy2y,mothernatureisfickle,1 point,Fri May 22 17:05:15 2015 UTC,"Make sure you're not confusing megabyte and megabit too. ISP's list their speeds in megaBITS, which is 1/8 of a Megabyte. So if you want to download a 1 megabyte file in 1 second you'd need an 8 megabit connection."

They really really help people, but it's less front facing. They are basically a food distributor to other local nonprofits, but, I think an okay portion of their business goes to religious organizations like the boy scouts and L&F.   If you want non-food volunteering, the SPCA, pretty lake camp, and the sexual health /planned parenthood clinics are all secular I believe :)"

In the near future (next 2-3 years) look for bike lanes down Burdick to Whites Rd and Mill St. There are probably 1 or 2 other projects that I am also not thinking of right now.

I bought a pre-built one, but once things go wrong you learn way more than you'd ever want to, do wish I had built my first one though, would have saved a lot of grief down the road.   Check out www.tinkercad.com, free browser-based modeling, it's simple but if you learn a few things here and there like I did it will help out tremendously, I've actually made a few somewhat complex designs using it."

You asked for a suggestion, and you pretty quickly disregard this person who was honestly trying to help you. I looked through some of your comment history and it seems like you are pretty abrasive regularly online.  I'm not saying that it's a bad thing, or that you should change if that's how you want to be. Just an outsider's perspective, I don't think any of your comments or posts feel friendly or helpful.  Probably if you made an effort to say ""thanks!"" or were a little more positive when you talk about various companies or places.  Anyway, I'm glad you found your item. I think there's a thing you could set up for the future where amazon delivers items to the post office for you, and you pick it up from them. It shaves a day off of shipping and then you don't have to deal with slow USPS :)"

kzoo,36omfb,banksnld,1 point,Thu May 21 13:25:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah I saw that deal they had. That printer has proprietary filament spool cartridges, which is kind of sucky. Yeah you can modify things to print from regular spools but then you're voiding warranty. I also understand that most the components do not have replacement parts availible readily, you have to send things in, that kind of sucks too. And it comes ABS only...which is fine for some. I like having the option of ABS, PLA, Nylon, etc. etc.  I've been thinking about building a Kossel Mini, the delta style printers look really interesting. Build it yourself kits are like $500, and I could use filament I already have, and parts easily available all over the place.  I've been messing with my Solidoodle 3 (lots of upgrades at this point) for over 2 years...it becomes an addiction...and then you want another...and more colors of filament, etc.  Open source printer is a good way to start, tons of forums and people who like to help.  Don't mean to knock your choice at all! You'll still have a blast, and you haven't sunk like $1200 into it like I have!"
kzoo,36omfb,HamDiesel,1 point,Thu May 21 14:33:25 2015 UTC,"I agree about open source, but this was my intro to 3d printing and I wanted an out of the box experience for as little $$$ as possible.   They have new firmware that supports PLA and nylon now. The proprietary filament works really well, at a cost. You can still do a chip reset with an arduino and not void the warranty, if you block the communication to the company.   All in all though, I enjoy the printer and their support, but I still might flash the firmware to run better software and avoid the chip resetter."

Main location, but it is my understanding that Burger King is in decline nationwide.  Stadium Dr. is owned by Carrols Corp. while W. Main is owned by Bennett Management Corp.  The 9th St. and downtown locations that closed were owned by Bennett Management.  I believe 9th St. closed because they couldn't compete.  At one time, Burger King was all alone on 9th St.  Then, about 10 years ago, Wendy's, Taco Bell, and Arby's all showed up around the same time and I think Burger King couldn't handle the competition.  The downtown Burger King had plenty of business, but they could not come to terms on a new 20-year land lease deal with the property owners.  Walgreens won't have that problem because they now own all 1.494 acres at 760 W. Michigan Ave."

So, Bob Evans could sell the land and building or lease the land and/or building to a tenant.

Second /u/darth1tater 's recommendation for Crane Park, that's a great location with a great view (although you've got to be ready to lose or chase balls when they escape the court on the north end)  I like playing at KVCC's Texas Township campus, they've got six courts which are frequently free.  Also the Maple Street Magnet School for the Arts has two courts. Not in the best condition, but also a great view.  The Lexington Green park in Portage has one tennis court, next to their hockey area. Haverhill park in Portage has two courts. Both of these locations have water and restrooms nearby, which is nice.  K College's Stowe Tennis Stadium has the highest quality public tennis courts I'm aware of in Kzoo.  There's a single court at Upjohn Park, by Bronson's main campus.  Portage Northern High School has a lot of really nice courts which are open to the public. Plenty of free parking on the north side of the courts.  Perhaps I'll see you out on the court sometime!"

When I was 12 years old, my mother and I traveled to the north of the state of Michigan for a vacation.  We stayed in a small cottage near a lake.  We'd taken our cat Tatsuka to stay with my grandmother during our sojourn, and we spent ten days beside the lake sunning, swimming, and riding the boats one could rent at the shore.  I met a girl there, and though we never fell in love, I'm certain that she existed.  She had come up to the cottage one evening and had dinner with us, my mother and I, and she brought a fish she'd caught from the lake.  I think her name was Claire.  On the seventh day of our vacation, my grandmother called the cottage.  My mother was out on the floating dock reading, so I answered.    ""Tatsuka is missing,"" said my grandmother.  ""You should come home soon.""  When my mother and I returned home, Tatsuka was on our front porch, sunning and looking none the worse for wear.  He'd crossed several miles of hazardous urban territory and a large river to flee  his captivity at my grandmother's house, and had set up peacefully outside his own home.  He greeted us with a ""mert"".  He seemed happy to see us, I guess.  He was certainly happy to hear the sound of the cat food can opening.  I've gone on to a succesful career in manufacturing... 23 years have passed and I've made some solid friendships with respected colleagues, married and have three children.  There have been ups and downs as one might expect in such cases.  But the question plagues me now as I write this.  As it most likely always will.  How did Tatsuka make his way home?  Perhaps more importantly, why?    And the city looks so different now.  New construction, more space, more of everything... it strikes me as mysterious.  A missing cat, a girl with a fish.  An earthquake?    So much motion without moving."

I recall the maximum amount of internet they could buy was 50 gigs a month for 90 bucks or so, like a cell phone data plan they limited your internet.   Before I knew all that I considered living there. I went through the whole process, was approved and on a waiting list. Never once did they tell me about their internet policy. I never thought to ask because who the fuck requires their own in-house internet? I assume it's in their lease but I never got that far. My buddy told me about it while I was on the waiting list and I immediately started looking for other places. My internet cannot be limited.

I always saw the hype for Oberon more so a hype for Bell's good beer, summer, and drinking outside. It's not super special individually, but craft brew has become a part of our state's identity, so people have gone crazy over it.  All in all, I'm a bigger fan of Whitsun, but I love that people go crazy for Oberon."
kzoo,35y82f,I-like-winter,8,Thu May 14 17:32:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of Bell's in general, but the other day... about two weeks ago, it was 81 degrees (our first 80+ day) and as the sun was just beginning to set my uncle showed up with a six pack of Oberon and his CD player.  He set up on my back porch, popped in a Rush CD and handed me an Oberon.  Might've been just the weather and music and the setting sun, but that beer tasted great... like winter finally breaking apart on spring and the evening couldn't have been more perfect."
kzoo,35y82f,rchase,2,Thu May 14 17:19:22 2015 UTC,"The fact that a craft brew can be this 'overrated' is a reflection of how amazing our beer world is. Oberon isn't bad, you may not like it, but it is an objectively decent beer (saying otherwise is just people hating on Bell's). It's so awesome that there are so many good beers around that Oberon is considered crappy in comparison."

Every time I try to care, I taste some other unique beer that just can't beat the brisk taste of an Icy and fresh lager.   I swear every time I've had someone's craft beer it's either a wheat or IPA, nobody makes luxury lagers...   I want a brisk-lager microbrew fad, Lager gets no love in the microbrews and homebrew. Better yet, ""Oberon Lager"", mix in the wheat and then make it nice and fresh.   For now it's Stella, Grosch, and Carlsberg."

kzoo,35yq1t,PhiladelphiaCollins6,2,Thu May 14 21:25:39 2015 UTC,"I have no idea, but I did see a shit ton of positions posted on Mitalent.  I've worked with a large supplier for Stryker and know the company pretty well internally, and they're a great company, but I've seen them purge before.  Back in the late '90s there was a union movement building on the manufacturing floor, and I remember making a delivery to the plant on Sprinkle one afternoon, and they had like 150 people out in parking lot.  Apparently they fired them all in one fell stroke, eliminating the possibility of unionizing."

kzoo,35yq1t,PasturesOfPlenty,3,Thu May 14 17:29:11 2015 UTC,"They have been doing this throughout the company it seems--not just IT, distribution and manufacturing as well. Several lines and facilities are in the process of being shut down. They claim to want to find everyone the 'right' home but you have to go through an entire interview process as if a new hire to transfer to a different department. Many people have been been defaulted into roles that may be seen as a step backwards in their career, lengthening the time it may take to gain promotions or work shifts that fit their personal schedules."

kzoo,35yq1t,rchase,1 point,Thu May 14 20:18:13 2015 UTC,"That's really not Stryker's style though.  They're really dedicated to the local community in terms of corporate culture. I assume they're one of the largest anonymous donors to the Kalamazoo Promise.  I think what OP said about switching to an outsourced IT model is probably more accurate.  And frankly, that makes a lot of sense in business terms (unfortunately?)  Stryker does hospital beds and surgical equipment, not computer science.  I guess regardless, those job postings would be for legal reasons... not to actually hire anyone."
kzoo,35yq1t,PasturesOfPlenty,4,Thu May 14 20:26:09 2015 UTC,"I would be willing to question if they are really about local community with some of their recent outsourcing tactics. I don't think they have intentions of closing the Kalamazoo campus but there is a slow culling of manufacturing positions.  All of Styker's blue collar jobs are provided by temporary staffing agencies, people spend years working as a temporary employee, doing the same work at much reduced pay and no benefits before they may be hired. Temporary can be let go without it looking like a layoff, an assignment runs out of a decision is made that certain people are not a good 'fit'. There seems to be revolving door policy where temporary employees work at Styker for some time, leave and come back, and are at the end of the (12 month+) line for consideration for hiring."

That would be as ridiculous as, say, farming out enforcement of parking violations to a private company, giving their profit-motivated word the force of law, and making it at least as difficult to dispute that company as law enforcement -- and the city would never do such a thing!"

kzoo,35g3vx,yellowfreesia,7,Sun May 10 00:43:33 2015 UTC,"Welcome to KZOO,  Gotta answer your question with a question.  Where are you moving from?  and do you have experience with West Michigan Snow?  For me the drive would be perfectly reasonable.  Apart from your neighborhood, the roads would be main roads and should be well plowed. I drove from Portage to Richland (about 15 miles) for work every day in my crappy mazda with low profile tires.  while there were days that made the trip a pain.  it was do-able. (I now have a Jeep, snow is no issue for me now)   If he is a doctor, and on call,  I guess there could be issues with late night snow storms that dump a couple feet on us,  and him getting to the hospital safely without decent tires.  But in reality,  maybe i'm used to it.  I don't think the snow is horrible here.  Just invest in good tires and a two-stage snow blower.   As for the lake house.  I have no experience with. Concerns would be, if it was a ""summer"" house.  Hows the insulation and windows.  Being on a lake you probably will have some wicked wind blowing and drafty windows will drive your heating bill way up.  Snow drifts could be a issue as well, again a good snow blower will make that easy.   If you are not from West Michigan,  Here's a pic of last years snow in Portage http://i.imgur.com/4mcbsOp.jpg"
kzoo,35g3vx,Dokterrock,3,Sun May 10 01:08:47 2015 UTC,"If he is a doctor, and on call, I guess there could be issues with late night snow storms that dump a couple feet on us, and him getting to the hospital safely without decent tires.   This would be an issue anywhere you live around Kalamazoo, though, so don't let it be the determining factor."
kzoo,35g3vx,urbaneyezcom,2,Sun May 10 06:36:12 2015 UTC,"We're moving from Milwaukee, so we get maybe a little less snow than Kalamazoo. The plowing here is great, and wanted to check with Kzoo since, yes, he is a doc. Good to hear that it shouldn't be a deal-breaker!"

kzoo,35g3vx,bbqturtle,3,Wed May 13 20:00:53 2015 UTC,"I lived on long lake for quite a few years.  The plowing out there isn't much worse than the rest of the city, the worst part is getting someone out there to do your driveway because (at least when I lived there) it tended to be the end of their lists being a bit outside of town and there aren't a ton of houses out there.    The commute isn't bad, you can get to major roads pretty quickly and those will generally be cleared pretty quickly.  I made pretty much the same commute he would be making at all hours of the day, in all weather.  I had a small 2 door car and was only unable to make it once (couldn't get down the street) in all my time there....I would have likely been fine/better off with a truck.  I will note that the roads close to the lake are (were -- when I was there visiting not long ago) pretty terrible....and also maybe worth noting police response out there is really, really slow.  The lake itself is very small and there are lots and lots of weeds and the bottom of the lake itself is very ""mushy"" (which seems to bother a lot of people) and there is very little to no sandy beach per se, unless you bring in sand.  The water occasionally had e coli/no swim warnings during my time there especially after heavy rains--I highly suggest keeping an eye on the advisories, I knew a couple of people who got really sick by not paying attention.   There is a pretty nice public park with public access to the water and it can get pretty busy in the summer, there are a few college ""party"" rental houses on the lake that can be loud, but unless you are right next door you mostly won't notice.  Fourth of July and other holidays often had huge drunken/illegal fireworks displays over the water.  There is a great tiny grocery store (actually 2 of them now) out there so you don't have to really go all the way into town unless you want to and a couple of really great small-town-feel locally owned restaurants within a couple of miles.  Oh and Latitude 42 is kinda out that direction and they have amazing beer and service.  It might have changed since I was last out there but it might be worth noting there were only 2 restaurants that delivered out there, 1 Chinese (terrible but cheap) and 1 pizza (amazing but expensive).  Also worth noting, most the houses out there had laundry in the basement and outside access to the basement....which is very cold/annoying in the winter and most of the houses (including my own) needed winterized windows and insulation.  Oh and other things about the area....it gets tons of fog (it can be awful in the early morning hours especially--you really have to drive slow) and in the fall there is lots and lots of leaf burning (so if smoke bothers you...it will).  Other than all that....I loved my time there.  I consider myself very tolerant and most of my neighbors were great (tho there was a guy with a chicken coop whose roosters woke me up far, far too often and several very loud motorcycles that came in at all hours of the day).  It's very, very safe and family friendly area.  I loved working on my deck and I miss swimming in the warm water (I gave it up for a freezing ocean....which I also love....but totally different reasons).  If I went back to Kalamazoo I'd probably seriously consider moving back to that area.  If you have any questions, feel free to let me know."
kzoo,35g3vx,kzoolander,2,Sun May 10 10:04:42 2015 UTC,I have lived in michigan my entire life. Kalamazoo winters can get harsh but we have some of the best plows services in the stat(Im pretty sure i just read an article about that the other day) that being said the other guy is completely right about all of that stuff. good tires make sure you have blankets hats and gloves in your trunk in case of an emergency. But living on the lake I have some experience with. Prepare to walk out your door in the summer and just sweat instantly. And mosquito's omg so many mosquito's. I would invest in a bat house or something of the sort living on a lake it is exponentially worse than other places. especially if it is a swampy lake compared to a swimable lake.

SO and I lived there a few years ago, we would have gladly broken the lease if there wasnt a ridiculous amount of fees. It seemed like there were always random fees every month. It seemed like they made up the water bill every month as well. No matter what we did the bill was always different. We tried not doing laundry in the apartment, not running the dishwasher, everything you can think of and we tried it.   Not very sound proof either. Had them move two large Indian families in above us while we lived there. These families were way over capacity for a 2 bedroom.  They also way overcharged for ""damages"" after we left."

I'm an asshole though, and the ac has to be below 70.  The water bill was added onto your rent that they actually sent you in the mail. Then they charged you for sending you said piece of mail. A ""service fee"" for a service you couldnt opt out of. Water was anywhere from $20-60 a month, didnt matter what we did to try and change it."

I've worked for 26 years in manufacturing accounting departments and I thought plant budgets were all smoke and mirrors.  I've never seen anything like the prospectus' (prospecti?) I've dug up and muddled through for UoM, MSU, and WMU.  They're more convoluted than Tolkien's Silmarillion.  So much money.  And yet these institutions all claim to be cash strapped at all times.  It doesn't make sense.  As to the Koch Brothers influencing WMU curricula via money... I have no comment other than ""of course there's influence.""   From the article:  “It has nothing to do with a point of view,” he (Professor Donald Alexander) says. “The support is for innovations in course development that I started several years ago in our Principles of Microeconomics course.”  That's the inner depths of stinking bullshit right there."

As for the change, its been a tough transition but I think we're finally through it and should be rolling quickly.   The new owner did some great buildout and brought in a huge cigarette rack (not a fan myself) but we kept most of the products my family always carried but just moved them around.

All the planning charts and road construction orders have been on display at your local planning department in Alpha Centauri for 50 of your Earth years, so you’ve had plenty of time to lodge any formal complaint and it’s far too late to start making a fuss about it now. … What do you mean you’ve never been to Alpha Centauri? Oh, for heaven’s sake, mankind, it’s only four light years away, you know. I’m sorry, but if you can’t be bothered to take an interest in local affairs, that’s your own lookout.

kzoo,34xix9,xTomBx,2,Tue May 5 17:29:25 2015 UTC,"Alternate routes to get to some areas on Westnedge:   To get to Southland or Crossroads mall, take Milham to Constitution to Mall Drive. To get to the shops from the east side (Jo-Ann's, Toys R Us, Aldi, Hobby Lobby, Dick's Sporting Goods and such), take Milham east of Westnedge to Newport Rd.  It curves around Walnut Trails Apartments and comes out at Westnedge & Mall Dr.  You can access many shops through the parking lot at Dick's. If you need to get to the south end of Portage in a hurry and don't want to deal with Westnedge, I recommend using Oakland or Lover's Lane.   Good Luck!"

The work also includes installing a new water main on the east side of Westnedge from Idaho Avenue to just north of Mall Drive and replacing traffic signals at the intersection of Milham Avenue and Westnedge. Work is expected to be completed in late August.

kzoo,34vt77,Tea_and_Scrumpets,3,Mon May 4 23:47:06 2015 UTC,Post a link to your portfolio. I can review and maybe make some recommendations if I see your work.   FYI I own a small design studio and we are always looking for new talent.
kzoo,34vt77,StogieFiend,1 point,Tue May 5 00:39:53 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for reaching out!   I replied to another comment here about my portfolio/body of work dilemma currently. The bottom line is I don't feel like the few projects I've taken on this year really respresent my talents, ambitions or personality very well, so I'm looking for a way to suppliment or even completely re-do my portfolio at this point.   From an employers perspective, would faux projects (clearly labeled as such) be a turn off in a portfolio? This is really the step that I'm on right now to gain confidence approaching clients and studios like yours and start that experiential inertia. Thanks again!"
kzoo,34vt77,StogieFiend,1 point,Tue May 5 14:39:52 2015 UTC,Glad to help.   I wouldn't look negatively on really good spec work. You might try redesigning something you've seen and taking the finished product to the client to see if they will give you a shot at some real work.   The bigger question I would ask is why aren't you proud of your book? If you are sending this work out into the world for a client it should be work that you are willing to show. As a designer I know we are always our worst critics and our work from the past is never as exciting as what we are working on now (FYI this changes a little if you work on a really good team). But you should only be sending clients finished work that you feel solves thier problem. If it does that then you should be able to speak to that when you show it in your portfolio.   Also. check out http://behance.net and http://dribbble.com you may get some inspiration from what other young designers have in thier portfolios.
kzoo,34vt77,StogieFiend,1 point,Tue May 5 14:54:01 2015 UTC,"Well it's not so much that I'm not a fan of my own work, but it's more that the few projects I've worked on were very small and for clients that requested work that just doesn't represent me very well.   Three recent examples were a company that provided services for medical marijuana and insisted on a pot leaf (in lieu of more...tasteful symbols such as a green cross), a local artist's website and printwork (who also insisted that I use her and her partners crayon drawn caricatures on her business cards) and the remains of a project another client bailed on for an essential oils company called Young Lovin (ripoff of an existing brand I believe) who wanted a swarthy, overly sexy theme to the point of cringe.   Believe me I don't want to come off as making excuses, I'm just hungry for a project that I can really dig into and I'm concerned that these don't do anything good for me besides as design water cooler talk about silly clients.  Also, pardon me if I'm wrong, but your username compells me to ask you: are you Carl Brown from Roguebotic?"
kzoo,34vt77,jrohlfing,1 point,Tue May 5 16:44:10 2015 UTC,I am Carl Brown from Roguebotic.  Have we met?   Showing a concept piece that wasn't picked by a client but showed good design thinking might help. Maybe if you took a stab at your own view on any of the projects you had.  Part of doing good work is giving clients options and maybe pushing them outside of thier comfort zone with some of hose options while still keeping one of the design options you show consistent with what they asked for.  Sometimes they surprise you.   Cheers.
kzoo,34vt77,jrohlfing,2,Wed May 6 12:41:35 2015 UTC,"What do you do in your free time? Do you ever go to any events that have terrible fliers or artwork in general? Talk to the people that run said events, give them your portfolio, and go from there.  When I first started in design, networking was how I got all of my gigs. Eventually all that experience lead to a real job.   A degree may or may not help you, but my recommendation is to always work on your product. Some of the worse designers I have ever seen got degrees, but so have some of the best."
kzoo,34vt77,StogieFiend,2,Tue May 5 13:15:39 2015 UTC,"Well I've been trying to be that guy a lot more lately and actively offer my services, but all I've really done in the past year are these really small projects that, honestly, don't look that great as a body of work. That's why I'm kind of fishing for advice because I keep getting psyched about potential clients and then when we finally discuss the project they want and most of them have been underwhelming. Are theoretical clients in a portfolio legitimate or do they come across as disingenuous?"

kzoo,34qi3d,bbqturtle,3,Sun May 3 17:48:07 2015 UTC,"How would that work? Everyone bringing ingredients or splitting the cost? Would it just be at your place?  I think it's a neat idea, and a great way for some people in the /r/kzoo community to get to know others."
kzoo,34qi3d,Onatel,1 point,Sun May 3 20:46:24 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't have a very big place, but I could probably have like 5 or 6 people over.  I wouldn't need people to chip in, but maybe we could just make a flat $5 rule regardless of what dinner is? and the host can make whatever dinner for people that want to come over?"
kzoo,34qi3d,Onatel,1 point,Sun May 3 23:34:02 2015 UTC,"That's fine, I personally can't offer up my place since I live with family, but I think it's a good idea, come up with a list of hosts, and how many are interested, and choose a place that can host that many people.  $5 per person could work, I was thinking just splitting the bill by the cost of ingredients by number of people, but then you'd have to know how many people were coming. In fact buying food in advance is difficult since it's hard to know how many will show up until the night of the dinner, but it could be something like a hangout; people get together, get the ingredients, and then cook on like a Saturday, but that would be a bigger time commitment.  Maybe make a google doc where people can input their interest, availability, and maybe their email or other way to contact them (messages on reddit would work too I suppose), then make another post when you decide a day, and message people with the info as a reminder to come?  I think it's a good idea, just iron out the details and I'll be there."

kzoo,34fju4,cbsteven,1 point,Fri May 1 00:03:21 2015 UTC,"We landed a place in Vine that was perfect, surprisingly, in terms of what we needed out of a house.  Our second choice was in Hillcrest but the house was pretty, but shitty.  Wet basement, holes in floors, one bathroom, no yard and 1700 a month.  We live in a much nicer neighborhood in columbus and we pay less than half of that in mortgage.  Hell, our smaller house is worth about 30k more than the house we looked at in hillcrest, to boot and we couldn't justify jumping down in quality and jumping up in cost.  Since we're just going to be there for a year, we figured we go with the perfect house in the slightly sketchy neighborhood.  We're right behind waldo stadium, so we can walk about anywhere, which I love, but I don't want to find out the hard way, with a three kid stroller, where I'm going to get mugged.  We'll also have a college kid, a cousin, living with us, so the size of it, and the number of bathrooms, has solid weight.    We looked at a house in portage, that had a great acreage and a decent home, but my wife has a thing about the smell of weed, and if you scraped the walls there, you could have smoked the shit and had a decent high, it smelled so strongly of weed.  It sort of turned her off to the place."

There are quite a few good trails and nature preserves in the area also: Celery Flats which runs from portage to the Kalamazoo river valley trail (all paved), al Sabo in Texas township (great for mountain biking) and another one in ostemo that has a great park and disc golf.   Definitely try to make several trips out to Lake Michigan with the family this summer. I'd suggest Van Buren State Park. It is a little south of South Haven and is a more peaceful beach experience."

It sounds like you might not love the ""culture"" of vine neighborhood long term, though if your home is in the right nook most of the college shit is negligible. It really depends on who your closest neighbors are.  The perks of the neighborhood are the proximity to cafes, restaurants, downtown and the price. The old homes tend to be pretty awesome, if a bit run down. There is a pretty stable community of owners and renters outside of the college crowd.  http://vineneighborhood.org/  If you want a most classic family friendly vibe Westnedge Hill, South Westnedge, Millwood, Winchell, Oakwood, and just about anywhere in Portage/Parchment/Comstock will be less ""urban."""

kzoo,33ofmo,keldoftheisles,15,Fri Apr 24 10:24:49 2015 UTC,http://i.imgur.com/3IqgX7j.gifv
kzoo,33ofmo,nicogor,7,Fri Apr 24 12:44:59 2015 UTC,"The usual reason is that women are generally unlikely to perform as well (if they even apply) in a job that consists largely of exploiting physical skills in which women are naturally deficient. Not only that, but many women never train in carpentry and the like, so you're looking at people who are usually inexperienced, often physically unsuited, and usually uninterested because of those two factors. It's the same reason people tend to ask for ladies to join a quilting circle. Male fine motor control issues aside, you can usually guarantee that they don't know how to sew anyway, and they're usually unmotivated to try out.  That said, it's still a silly and unnecessary distinction in this post title, but probably an innocent one."
kzoo,33ofmo,keldoftheisles,-5,Fri Apr 24 22:33:03 2015 UTC,"Your entire comment is ridiculous.   Wait, I'll give you that carpentry is a  male dominated field, but the rest is literal nonsense."
kzoo,33ofmo,nicogor,3,Sat Apr 25 03:53:03 2015 UTC,"misusing the word literally   It isn't. Whatever agenda of mine you're getting by intentionally misinterpreting my comment, you're incorrect. I posted verifiable facts long known to general public (let alone actual experts) that explain much of gender-based demographic occupational disparity. If you want it laid out plainly, then the specific example that I cited aside others, due to its public and academically accepted weight, is the fact that the statistical female is weaker than the statistical male, and is genetically predisposed to gain upper body strength and dexterity at retarded rate and proportions compared to her counterpart. Thus she is disincentivized to pursue (and when surveyed, shows little interest in) a career that in its basic operation requires near-constant demonstration of the very type of strength and dexterity in which she is biologically deficient. When one also considers that Western gender roles stigmatize female education and even knowledgeability in maintenance and constructive trades, you are opening the door to our present situation, in which women are less likely to be physically suited to an industrial trade and simultaneously are unlikely to have been given or allowed so much as a familiarization with such crafts. This tends to create a general lack of interest, which creates a generational feedback loop. These are the most prominent reasons given by surveyed women on the reason for their disinterest in industrial trades.   There is no need to be upset. If you're uncomfortable with the fact that people have intrinsically offset skill sets, strengths, and weaknesses based on their sex, then I'd advise that you do your best to reincarnate as a bacterium, or a patch of lichen.  Now if I offer to try to dig up the sources from when I originally did this in university (to acclaim, I might add), then on a scale from 1 to Mansplaining, how literally nonsensical would that be?"
kzoo,33ofmo,keldoftheisles,-1,Sat Apr 25 04:42:55 2015 UTC,"While the post doesn't directly say it, it's implying men can do the job while women can't. Which is wrong.  There are successful female carpenters out there.  There are also women interested in getting int the field. More importantly, you're seeing my comment from one way when you really need to be looking at it from another.  I'm not arguing that you're incorrect about a lack of females in the field or lack of interest.  It's hard to break that idea that carpentry is a ""man's job"".  That's like saying men can't sew, they're hands are too big.  We all know that's not true.  You bring up biology....which I'm only going to argue an aspect of your point.  First of all, carpentry does not require Mr. Universe strength. The strength needed and dexterity needed for the trade is something women are more than capable of obtaining.  If you don't believe this, maybe you should look a little closer at your research and really figure out what it's saying.  There are so many scenerios that could play out in which a woman would be more qualified than a man.  (Two applicants - both inexperienced - one is a man who is overweight and sits around on his ass all day; the other is a woman who works out and is fit - are you still going to argue the man is more qualified for the job?)  You can't get women interested in a field or let alone training for it if you tell them they can't or aren't fitted to do it. You have to spark that interest and with your comment, you're helping prevent that from happening.  http://www.yesmagazine.org/new-economy/less-than-two-percent-of-carpenters-are-women-meet-master-builder"

Three things, though.  1.Anecdotes have no bearing on a discussion that's solely about statistics  2.Feels have no bearing on reals  3.Do some rereading with your guard down and you'll see I actually agree with you in many ways"
kzoo,33ofmo,keldoftheisles,-2,Sat Apr 25 13:11:18 2015 UTC,"It really doesn't matter statisitcally what a populations perceived fitness for a job is. I've worked many carpentry type jobs and have done a bit of painting and staining and such. These really are not jobs that require tons of strength that 'only a man could posses'. Yes, these jobs can be physically exerting but that certainly does not disqualify one gender from being able to perform them. I have seen women carpenters, electricians, construction workers that are quite good at their jobs.  Even if your statistical female argument was correct, which it really doesn't matter if it were, this is still absolutely no excuse for sexism in hiring practices. Lets just hypotehically for a moment say that, on average, women did not have the capability to perform this job--noting this is not at all what I believe. Then you are saying that because the ordinary woman cannot do something, then no woman, including the extraordinary, should be given the oppertunity. Different populations may have differences, but to exclude individuals based on a percieved or real differences of a population is prejudice.  I don't see the need to try to 'explain away' a post that is actually violating equal oppertunity employement laws in the state."

I'm not an agent of the Patriarchy™, in fact I strongly opposed any differential treatment at all during my tenure on faculty at Spring Arbor. What I am attempting to convey is an explanation of why disparity occurs using facts. In fact you're more than welcome to purchase a copy of my thesis. But I did not give you the impetus to temporize, and to extract meanings, motivations, and societal editorials from my explanation. What I wrote is the only thing you should be looking at, I intentionally left no interpretation open. I'm disappointed that you seem intent on politicizing what I intended to be a neutral and frank discussion. There's no need to get a hurt butt."

kzoo,33gxtx,Iamfrontosa,9,Wed Apr 22 13:06:26 2015 UTC,This is a somewhat sad situation. This person does not deserve to go through a criminal justice system. It's amazing to me how many people in this community think alcohol should be severely limited by the city or even prohibited.  Richard Stewart is named in the article as issuing the initial complaint. He is a vocal citizen and speaks at most city commission meetings. He hates just about everything the commission is doing. He thinks alcohol is a plague on the city.
kzoo,33gxtx,letgoandflow,4,Wed Apr 22 13:26:36 2015 UTC,He's also a real-estate agent who makes his money by purchasing and flipping foreclosed homes.  This was a fundraiser for a group that seeks to reduce the number of foreclosures in the neighborhood.  So just MAYBE this has more to do with just alcohol.

kzoo,33gxtx,letgoandflow,3,Wed Apr 22 21:28:02 2015 UTC,If this goes to a jury trial I hope the defense attorney reminds the jury of their nullification power. A jury can acquit a defendent even if they are guilty if they believe the law is unjust or they should have not been charged in the case.
kzoo,33gxtx,PasturesOfPlenty,6,Wed Apr 22 16:00:26 2015 UTC,You can't inform a jury of the jury nullification power. A lawyer could potentially face sanctions for raising that issue. Jurors are usually bounced early if they say they can't apply the law to the facts- happens fairly regularly in death penalty cases. But I agree this charge is bogus.
kzoo,33gxtx,urbaneyezcom,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:04:23 2015 UTC,"That sort of surprises me that the defense wouldn't be able to mention it. I feel like most jurors would be unaware of nullification, and having been on a jury somewhat recently, none of the jury instructions mention it either.

Further, there isn't a rebuttal in the article to the landlord's complaint that the City won't act: to wit, that the City shouldn't and can't, because it's privately owned land.  Turning it into a public right of way is another discussion entirely; I have also seen landowners (as part of a wider maintenance agreement) erect a barrier at a midpoint so that the alley is no longer a through-route."
kzoo,32te0t,rich_ard,1 point,Fri Apr 17 13:22:37 2015 UTC,"Well, I guess you'll have to tell Scott Borling that he doesn't know what he's talking about and that his maps are fake. Let me know how that goes. As for the rebuttal, here you go: ""The city lists more than 180 streets as private. Many serve mobile home parks, Western’s campus and commercial properties. And City Attorney Clyde Robinson says there’s no question that it’s not Kalamazoo’s job to maintain them."" I understand why the article might make you angry, but I don't see how the reporter is at fault here at all."
kzoo,32te0t,rebeccat007,0,Fri Apr 17 14:00:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not angry at all, and not all private alleys are listed as streets with a municipality. I think that the reporter could have done a better job digging for information on what it means to have access via private route, and I happen to have a perspective on it informed by more than a decade as an underwriter and researcher of real property records and ownership interests (and a state-licensed continuing education instructor for the topic).  For what it's worth, on Wednesday next week I will be pulling records on this alley as I'm now genuinely curious as its history. :)"
kzoo,32te0t,rich_ard,2,Fri Apr 17 14:25:01 2015 UTC,"The point of speaking to Borling and featuring the plat map was not to establish who owns what on Vine Place. For that, I have a stack of deeds from the county, compiled over an afternoon at the clerk/register's.  Rather, it was to show that Vine Place, unlike other private streets in the city, was never public. That's an important detail. Nobody petitioned to make it private, it simply 'evolved' that way. The plat map and Borling establish that.  Petitions to vacate a street are handled through the city. It took plenty of digging through city commission minutes to show that Vine Place was never public."
kzoo,32te0t,Sehvilla,0,Fri Apr 17 16:35:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response! I presume you're the author of the piece, and will reiterate that I think it ought to have been clearer not just that the City's position is that no maintenance should fall to them, but that in fact there isn't any reason to expect they would - and that a basic explanation of private easement rights would go a long way.  Will also acknowledge that as it's my narrow area of practice, I'm more likely than most to pick nits. For example, a private street rarely becomes one through vacation; that generally causes the land to be divided among adjacent owners.  My point is that there didn't seem to be a focus here - the City has no duty to act, and the landlords aren't being brought to do so by their tenants. It's a pisser - and the parties most needed to petition for dedication as a public right of way are unlikely to do so.  Thanks for responding! I spend a lot of time working on land title in Michigan, let me know if I may lend a hand. And for what it's worth, I think Borland is a pretty good clerk. :)"
kzoo,32te0t,rich_ard,1 point,Sat Apr 18 00:13:02 2015 UTC,"Brick is really terrible for this.  The bricks settle and the road becomes increasingly uneven over time due to thermal fluctuation and erosion.    A good example of this is Academy at the bottom of the hill dumping out of K-College.  2 years ago we had cloudburst of intense rain for about an hour at 5am.    The bottom of Academy has sunk so low, that by 5:30 it was a raging river nearly a meter deep.  It being dark and raining so hard that visibility was shit, my wife didn't see how deep it had gotten, and drove her car into the thing, immediately sucking water into the engine block and exploding her pistons.  Totaled the vehicle.  By the time I got down there to rescue her, there were 4 more vehicles toasted in the deluge.  Nasty."
kzoo,32te0t,rchase,1 point,Thu Apr 16 16:28:19 2015 UTC,"Does anyone know how these private streets are owned exactly? I am kind of imagining that the street is going through multiple land parcels and each property owner technically owns a small piece of the road? I can't imagine that these roads are wholly owned by a single individual, unless they own all of the adjacent properties."
kzoo,32te0t,ElBeartoe,3,Thu Apr 16 19:57:03 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much it, unless one owner owns all the surrounding buildings."
kzoo,32te0t,rich_ard,0,Thu Apr 16 21:02:24 2015 UTC,"Real estate ownership can be thought of as a collection of rights in and to the use of property; in this case, many parties may share rights to their and others' property to get access to a public road. What's at issue here is lack of responsible care on the landowners' part, poor research by the reporter, and the failure of successive owners to record an explicit maintenance agreement at the County (which is, more and more, becoming a requirement for FHA/FNMA/VA-backed loans)."

Give the Westwood area another look it is a nice neighborhood that keeps you a bit closer to the city. My wife and I have lived here for 4 years now. She is a clinician with a Master's degree. I defend my PhD this summer. Our neighbors are entrepreneurs, teachers, and retirees from similar middle-class jobs. We have walking access to the Kal-Haven and Kalamazoo River Valley trials, a nice quiet park, and a number of restaurants and bars. The neighborhood is a quiet, friendly, safe, and diverse place...plus it is KPS, so the Kalamazoo promise applies.  May not be a concern to you at this time, but if you plan on selling it, that could be a draw to a young family. Downtown is quick and easy, if I hit the lights its 5 minutes. You shouldn't find too many college students in the neighborhood either, although there is a large WMU associated apartment complex across Drake on Croyden, they seem to keep to themselves. Finally, westside is growing with the reinvestment in the Stadium drive area, not sure if Portage can say the same."

kzoo,32olbo,letgoandflow,6,Wed Apr 15 13:36:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting this. It seems pretty accurate to the current status of things right now. I would highly recommend anyone living in Oshtemo, Texas or Pavillion Township who is concerned with potential loss of routes out to KVCC, Meijer/Walmart on M-43 and Pavillion Estates to let their elected officials know.  A 0.75 millage rate (plus 0.40 for Metro County Connect) is quite a good deal for fixed-route bus service which includes Sunday service and extended hours. Most comparable transit districts in Michigan levy 2-3 mils for similar service."
kzoo,32olbo,PasturesOfPlenty,3,Wed Apr 15 15:40:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the post.    I was the one who was griping about Metro Transit lines, though I didn't really intend it as a gripe.  Metro is great, I just wish it could be better, and it sounds like they're working on that, which is excellent.  I need to take my own advice from that thread and start attending more of these meetings."

kzoo,32olbo,rchase,2,Thu Apr 16 19:03:26 2015 UTC,"There's certainly more work to do, but this is a great start and a long time coming. If you do have ideas for ways to improve routes, post them or attend an upcoming meeting. Connecting the south side of town has been a tricky problem for a few years now. The Portage bus routes have been in at least 2 or 3 different configurations. The new director of Metro Transit seems more receptive to feedback which is a good thing as well."
kzoo,32kmw2,c6hendrickso,28,Tue Apr 14 15:36:39 2015 UTC,"Perhaps the most accessible and important thing redditors can do is attend and participate in Kalamazoo City Commission meetings.  In so doing you come to understand the complexity of the problems facing the city, and how difficult it can be to find solutions to them.  It's pretty eye-opening when you sit through a contentious hour long debate about changing a random 2 way stop to a safer 4 way.  It's pretty much the antithesis of ""wicked fun,"" but for better or worse it's the way things actually get done around here.  Beyond that are a couple things I would hope to do, but which would be nearly impossible:  Completely legalize* possession/use of reasonable quantities of cannabis (say, less than a 1/2 oz.)  C'mon people, it's 2015 and we all know it's less harmful to society than a cheap and legal 25 oz. can of Budweiser.  Turn all of the one-way streets downtown back to 2-ways.  (Bobby Hopewell actually campaigned on that issue in his first run for Mayor, but hasn't done anything about it since being in office.)  Expand funding for public transport and add bus routes.  Though Metro Transit is great, it's frustrating that the Westnedge route and the Oakland routes don't have a transfer.  Currently you're stuck with one or the other, so, for instance, getting from WMU Campus to the mall in Portage is impossible via bus.  Greatly reduce the cost of summer events at the Arcadia Creek Festival Place.  The admission and cost of food for most of these events is expensive enough to prohibit access for half of Kzoo's population.  I'd really like to see massive increase in funding for mental illness treatment and aid for the homeless.  It has always struck me how large the homeless population is for a city as small as Kalamazoo - something seems really out of balance there.  I suspect the rate of unemployment is much higher in Kzoo county than statistics reflect.  This is a huge problem.   That's all I've got off the top of my head.    *edit: thanks u/gravitational_bong"
kzoo,32kmw2,rchase,7,Tue Apr 14 16:14:07 2015 UTC,"Expand funding for public transport and add bus routes.

Currently you're stuck with one or the other, so, for instance, getting from WMU Campus to the mall in Portage is impossible via bus.   I get this one is nearly impossible as you said, but man is it horrible. A couple of years back, when we only had one car, lived near Westwood neighborhood, and my wife worked at Crossroads mall, she had to take the bus; it was usually a twelve hour day for a six hour shift; of course, that was when she got out at 7pm or earlier; after that, it was too late, as buses stopped running at 9pm and she couldn't make the trip in that ""measly"" two-hour or less time frame.    The entire metro transit needs to be redesigned from scratch; it's a patch of a change on a modification on top of the original design, back when everyone was going to and from downtown Kalamazoo only, because that's all there was in the early 20th century.    I agree with your other points as well, but that one's always bugged me something fierce; you add on the lack of bike routes from most of Kalamazoo to Portage, and the design of this area basically says ""own a car or GTFO."""
kzoo,32kmw2,StDoodle,3,Tue Apr 14 16:45:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said.  I currently live on Oakland, and though both my wife and I have cars, we also both work.    So a couple years ago with teenaged daughters in high-school who didn't have cars, and who attended (between the three of them), K-Central, Loy Norrix, KAMSC, WMU ATYP and K-College in various combinations and at differing times during the day, it was a fucking logistics nightmare.  I spent many many hours as an ad hoc taxi service driving from work to various schools and back.  All of this could have been solved with a sane public transit system.    I can't imagine how it must be for folks with no access to a car.    And yeah, though bike lanes are on the increase, our civic design in America in general (sprawl) by definition makes biking anywhere safely a serious challenge.  I often ride from my house near D&W out to Meijers, and though there are bike lanes the whole way, it still approaches a suicide mission at various points in the journey.  People in this town do not know how to drive, and 78% of them are texting and drifting.  It's a nightmare on a bike."
kzoo,32kmw2,rchase,3,Tue Apr 14 17:05:04 2015 UTC,"Seriously, the people around here are terrible drivers, and I've seen people on bikes do stupid things, too. I try to be extra careful when there are people in the bike lane, or out on Westnedge, but if a guy on a bike is going to ride through a red light because he doesn't want to stop, I can't stop that easily. I work downtown, so driving down here can be a nightmare because no one knows how to parallel park and blocks traffic for 5 minutes, or there are giant trucks that just stop in the lanes because downtown roads were not designed for that. :\ I've seen too many accidents that made me go, ""WTF WERE YOU DOING?!"" including one where I was turning left on the green light at Romence and the mall and some teenage girl blasted past two solid lanes of stopped traffic through a red light into my truck."

I leaned over and honked and the guy finally moved, but husband said I was the asshole.

There's still some potential problems coming up with the transition to a regional system, but if things go as planned, we'll at least have Sunday busses and service until midnight shortly. BTW, the CCTA, which is the group overseeing the transition of the bus system, has regular meetings as well. Go to www.kalcountytransit.com"

Sunday bus and 12am service is definitely a step in the right direction.  I haven't been involved with any of this planning, so I speak from ignorance... but also understand the complexity of the system.  How would you envision a crosstown connector route working, or what would you do to the current route map?  Loop Westnedge up and Oakland down from downtown to Celery Flats, include a small loop out to Oshtemo, and another through WMU (piggy back on WMU's service there if necessary.)    Seems simple, but it's not.  I get that.  Much more expensive.  I'm certainly not complaining about Metro now, just wishing it could be better."
kzoo,32kmw2,PasturesOfPlenty,3,Tue Apr 14 23:18:43 2015 UTC,"Expanding public transportation is going to happen, given the August millage for the CCTA is approved. With a 0.75 millage rate the Kalamazoo fixed-route bus service will see extended hours, Sunday service and increased route frequency on several routes.  Route modifications are always being considered by the transit authority. About a year ago service was expanded into Pavillion Township's Pavillion Estates. If you would like to see route changes I highly recommend you attending a meeting of the KCTA or CCTA. The board of both these organizations do care about better quality public transportation and organizers have been working hard to expand the scope of Kalamazoo's transit system--and it is happening!"

kzoo,32kmw2,letgoandflow,3,Wed Apr 15 13:02:58 2015 UTC,"Great post!  Trying to reduce the price of the arcadia events is pointless. The prices are driven by the market and help put on a quality event. If the prices were lowered, than you'd have a crap event and super long lines, which isn't good for anyone.  Edit: What I really meant to say was if you can find a way to lower prices and still put on a quality event that is profitable, then I'm all for it.

kzoo,32kmw2,diyorgasms,6,Tue Apr 14 16:30:01 2015 UTC,"Marijuana is NOT decriminalized in Kalamazoo. STOP SPREADING THIS. What happened is that marijuana is the lowest possible law enforcement priority, but if you're young and brown that doesn't mean a damn thing for you. Also the penalties are reduced, but possession of marijuana is still a misdemeanor, which means you have to disclose it on job applications, etc.  Spreading the false information that marijuana is decriminalized is only going to contribute to people doing things that have the potential to cause serious harm to their lives (the legal repercussions, not the actual marijuana)."

kzoo,32kmw2,Gravitational_Bong,2,Wed Apr 15 13:06:02 2015 UTC,"Decriminalization is not well-defined. You are not completely correct in that you only speak of one event, but there were two changes:  http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/10/marijuana-officially-decriminalized-in-kalamazoo-michigan/  You're right that Kalamazoo's decriminalization didn't reduce possession to a civil infraction a la Ann Arbor, and so it doesn't go far enough, but as we probably all agree far enough would simply be legalization. That is the real point I was trying to make."
kzoo,32kmw2,diyorgasms,3,Tue Apr 14 18:53:21 2015 UTC,"I think a fair definition of ""decriminalization"" is that something no longer carries a criminal penalty, no? A misdemeanor is a criminal penalty ipso facto marijuana is not decriminalized."

kzoo,32kmw2,ArMcK,6,Tue Apr 14 21:29:30 2015 UTC,"Not all of these are actionable, but this is what I see Kzoo needs:    Better bus service. There are so many carless people in Kzoo metro whose needs are not being met. In the Sprinkle/Gull Rd area I'd estimate that roughly 1/2 of the working population makes due without a car.  Better urban/suburban agriculture. Tie it in to CSAs, community gardens, feeding the homeless and the vulnerable. Roads  A free outdoor weekly music series during warm weather. A real skate park. Any annual community/festival/contest thing we can do with the river, that's a major asset that just isn't being utilized."

It was going to have some permanent elements, but mostly moveable pieces.   I was on a non-profit around 2001 that helped communities build skate parks. We helped get the portage park going. It was around $120,000 if I remember.   If you can get organized, you can get funding. But it takes a lot of effort and a lot of community support."
kzoo,32kmw2,redbeard8989,3,Tue Apr 14 19:55:41 2015 UTC,"I would love love love to see kalamazoo ave become the major road through town.   Make it a two way and route traffic around the main city blocks.   This would allow michigan ave to convert to 2 lanes, 1 lane each way, and add lots of green downtown.  Where west main comes down to michigan ave, have it curve north into the arch that follows the railroad into kalamazoo ave.   Make douglas two way but dont allow east to north turning.  Michigan ave going east from there would have stop signs at westnedge and park while those two streets just flow through with no stopping and remain 1 way arteries north and south through town.    Put in trees and flowers where the extra lanes are.   Increase the foot traffic downtown and increase business.   I love the way Ann Arbor is downtown with all the shops easily accessible via foot. Downtown kalamazoo has too much traffic."

This is how change happens - not through apathy and waiting for someone else to step up and do the work it takes to make change in a municpality. And it's ball-breaking work to make these sorts of changes, but with enough folks involved, it is possible.  Colony Farm Orchard is under attack again by Western Michigan University for BTR Park expansion through some pretty fucking underhanded dealings. Go ahead and search it on MLive if you want updates. I have been an organizer for protesting this expansion (because the original land restrictions of the land grant prevented any development whatsoever - it was supposed to remain public land) and we have approached the City Commision, County, and neighboring Oshtemo City Commission, since it's actually under their jurisdiction.   I am personally invested in this project because I am a manager of the WMU Apiculture Research Apiary, and our 7 bee colonies reside on this property. Real student research happens here and they've essentially told us to pack up.  Get involved and make waves! Find those who feel as strongly as you do!"

I lived in a regular 1bd, which is tiny (as in, you can't close the bathroom door while you're in the bathroom unless you're standing in the tub). Like most property management companies, they use cheap stuff, and I'm pretty sure my bathroom counter was at least 30 years old. Laundry is in every other building, you need your key to get in, and there's some sort of curfew on doing laundry. They allow 2 cats in older buildings, and I believe they need to be declawed. Kitchen is small and does not have a dishwasher. AC is an in-wall unit in the living room, and tbh, it's pretty useless. Heat is free.  I, personally, never had issues, but don't think I'd move back.

I don't really understand why more people don't look at it for weddings.  It's going to cost about $2200 for the venue, but the best part is that they let you bring in outside vendors for catering. So I have a caterer I shopped around for and am getting booze at costco. Most nice venues require that you use their catering service, so this saves a ton and lets me pick the exact food I want.

kzoo,31oef8,mrgoalie,2,Tue Apr 7 04:58:42 2015 UTC,Comcast territory is south of the 10000 block in Portage.  Everywhere else is Charter.
kzoo,31oef8,Roll3d6,2,Tue Apr 7 01:11:34 2015 UTC,Inside Kalamazoo & Portage its a choice between Charter & AT&T.  The surrounding areas are Charter.
kzoo,31oef8,CRIZZLEC_ECHO,2,Tue Apr 7 02:41:28 2015 UTC,"My only problem with charter is the 30$ install fee raises the price to 70$ for the first month, charter defends this by making up claims like ""it costs 100-150$ to send a truck to install Internet"" which I would almost believe if I hadn't noticed that this was the same apartment I was in when they installed Internet 6 years ago.   Charter is the only option, and yet they're lying assholes right from the start. Apparently the choice is fast Internet at expensive upfront costs, or slow Internet via AT&T at 170$ upfront costs. So charter plays the good guy by offering a ""discount"" despite still charging imaginary installation fees for a building already installed.   I'd be totally cool with 40$ Internet, not so much with 40$ plus ""fuck you, gimme gimme anyway"" 70$ Internet."

Money ran tight toward the end of my residency and I went for the cheaper $40/mo price and didn't notice a difference in speeds for my everyday usage. Best internet I've ever had. Aside from a single outage event, I never had problems with their service either."

Further out Gull is fine but disconnected from the city, if that matters to you. Anything due north from gull is the village of parchment or is country. Parchment isn't my favorite area but it's generally quiet. As far as kalamazoo city is concerned, for apartments avoid the north side (north of the railroad tracks) or Edison (south down portage road). Those are the rougher neighborhoods in town."

I live on the Eastern edge of it near downtown Kalamazoo.  Like any other city, when you're walking at night, be sure to have a friend or two with you. Having a car also helps.   Unfortunately the term ""bad"" neighborhood is associated with places where families and individuals of low income life inside of. Most of them just want to get by/live a normal peaceful life.

kzoo,31d3vb,captaincupcake234,3,Sat Apr 4 23:14:05 2015 UTC,"The student ghetto is within the Vine Neighborhood.

kzoo,31d3vb,epidermisinmythermos,3,Sun Apr 5 03:22:09 2015 UTC,"Stockbridge is the worst street on the east side. They are starting to revitalize portage st near the library but it will take a while for it to become safe. Stay away from the north side, cheapest rent but nothing good happening around there. The west side will put you near the college crowd, a bit more expensive and loud but pretty safe. Vine neighborhood has some break ins but if you plan on running or want to bike to work its a great area. Best of luck. The bar scene is great if you enjoy live music and beer. If you are going to live on the west side and have anything to drink get a cab ride home because they are notorious for setting up breathalizer stations around western. Have fun!"

Old dog is a wonderful place to grab a beer and hang out with friends, great food too. If you follow the train tracks to the north from there you'll run into boatyard brewery. They have some pretty good beer. They opened in the last year or so and have been getting better every month. They have a tamale guy there and free popcorn but not too much more for food. Gonzos has good beer but a little pricey.  Alamo drafthouse would make a great date night. Its a movie theatre that serves dinner and drinks. Great pizza and burgers and a pretty good beer selection.

kzoo,31d3vb,jjuffer,3,Tue Apr 7 15:40:21 2015 UTC,"Here's my rule of thumb. Draw a line south from downtown along Westnedge. Then draw another line west from downtown along North St.   Anywhere south and west of those lines (including downtown) is generally not sketchy. Anywhere east and north of those lines (not including downtown) is generally sketchy. The worst parts are east of Portage St, south of downtown; and immediately north and east of downtown. Borgess itself is fine, but the immediate area around it is a little sketchy.   You might want to consider an apartment somewhere on West Main. It's a much nicer area than anywhere right near Borgess and it's right by some big stores and the highway. Embassy Terrace is cheap and fairly nice, I have a few friends who live there. It'll be a bit of a commute but not too terrible.  The student ghetto (the web of small streets between Oakland and Westnedge, north of Howard) isn't too bad. It's where a lot of students live, so there's noise and parties and the usual petty crime, but it's not significantly more dangerous than anywhere else."
kzoo,31d3vb,fuktardy,1 point,Sat Apr 4 14:25:21 2015 UTC,"Long time resident, this is really, really, true. Even about the apartments on West Main. There's some good housing on West Main, kendall, Drake Road. Those are the places I would canvass."
kzoo,31d3vb,eratoast,2,Mon Apr 6 13:25:19 2015 UTC,Most areas directly west of the hospital are safe if you observe basic safety rules- don't walk alone at night especially if you've been drinking.
kzoo,31d3vb,eratoast,2,Fri Apr 3 23:20:08 2015 UTC,"Cooper's Landing is a closer to Parchment. It's an okay spot. There are some lesser ghettos around but I'd say the one on the lower-east side is the worst, Portage Street/Mills Street area."
kzoo,31d3vb,lunaisatuna,2,Sat Apr 4 18:58:03 2015 UTC,"Cooper's Landing is fine, Gull Run/Gull Prairie are fine, as well. Both are close to Borgess. Portage is great and close to everything.

Cat friendly is pretty easy to find, it's usually dogs that are harder. Look into Pines West in Portage, too--they allow cats and don't charge fees."

kzoo,319bff,higgles5,5,Fri Apr 3 14:03:48 2015 UTC,"It is closer, but it's also a lot more expensive.  I think young folks forget that the downtown area is populated by many more people than just students, and much of that population is relatively low income.  D&W is not an economical grocery alternative for a majority of families in metro kzoo."

kzoo,319bff,OnlyIknow9,-5,Sun Apr 12 15:42:25 2015 UTC,"Kalamazoo, Michigan or The United States isn't like the rest of the world. Things around here are spread out, public transportation is lacking and most often inefficient and taxi/cab service is super expensive. So what makes a PhD student think they can get away with no transportation that they themselves own? I get owning a car and choosing to walk. But to choose not to own, when it costs so little money to do so... then complain when you have to walk further, because of your own life choice... Sorry. Not sorry."
kzoo,319bff,jjuffer,2,Fri Apr 3 02:43:24 2015 UTC,"Owning a car is not something I would categorize as affordable for many people. Yes, most of the US is spread out and horrible for pedestrians but that doesn't mean everyone SHOULD own a car. 1. It's not environmentally responsible and 2. The trend in development is going towards more dense urban centers. Kalamazoo would be stupid to not invest in walkable amenities."
kzoo,319bff,czech_it,2,Fri Apr 3 08:27:33 2015 UTC,"Kalamazoo would be stupid to not invest in walkable amenities.   I'd love to see more walkable amenities. But there is no mandate for them to exist - public investment rarely, if ever, brings them here. Sure, the farmers market is a Kalamazoo investment, but you'll never see a ""Kalamazoo City Grocery"".  There must be a demonstrated need that attracts a business to the area, and it needs to be profitable.   Fortunately, I think that this trend has been picking up. While we have one less grocery store, I believe that it's temporary. I wouldn't be surprised to see another store in that spot when redevelopment is complete."
kzoo,319bff,jage9,2,Fri Apr 3 14:37:56 2015 UTC,"This! Owning a car really is not a cheap thing to do. Between car payments, insurance, gasoline, maintenance, parking (especially depending on where you live in Vine, you may have to pay for a parking spot) you are realistically looking at spending $200, $300, $400 a month to own a vehicle. For many people, this is simply not affordable.  Transportation is a huge barrier for many people in their daily living and working. Many shift jobs are inaccessible to those who do not already own a car. This creates situations where people are capable of working but the arbitrary requirement of owning a vehicle to get to work hinders employment options."

This young archer has had the incomprehensible luck to fall into crew with his idols, be reared by their best and given some of their most guarded musical secrets, then hoisted to a platform to blare his prodigious beats from places where most creators can only dream of being.  Born in Tehran, Iran, Ardalan Noghre-Kar possesses a peculiar, fresh perspective on music genesis without even trying. His mixes, remixes and dubs are known for their sass, energy and wickedly wry samples that snap like a wet towel to the face, but his original tracks are where his efforts shine, like those released with Justin Martin-“Mr. Spock,” a 2010 party anthem charted by Diplo and Jesse Rose, and “Lezgo,” charted by Dog Blood (Skrillex and Boyz Noise)-and those soon-to-be-released on his own EP with Dirtybird. It's no wonder he's been given the nod by everyone from Papa Dirtybird himself (Claude Von Stroke) and A-Trak to those who are charting his remixes, like Maya Jane Coles, Audiojack, and Riva Starr, the last of whom he has an upcoming remix for to be released on Snatch.  The greatest strength in Ardy's music is his ability to whip out hits that work equally well from the dankest basements to the most opulent dancefloors; sounds that satisfy those with diverse tastes who can unite under his single agenda of having a good time.

I plan to do the A+ and Linux+ in the next year or so.  Edit: All of my experience is in a Windows environment but I do love Linux and use it every day on my personal laptop.
kzoo,30dpd0,smegma_legs,1 point,Thu Mar 26 20:24:58 2015 UTC,"yeah, like I said in a comment above, an A+ cert is going to open up your possibilities, as I know of a few places who won't even read a resume if they don't have it.  Linux+ is a good bonus, too.  People like to see skill diversity.  There's a certification center in GR iirc."

They learn the technology as they're deploying it and normally mess it all up in the process.  They have lost a ton of employees in the past 2 years, and a lot of customers are jumping ship too.  I will say their A/V design person is top notch, and just about the only person I trust there."

There are way too many good restaurants in Kalamazoo for Studio Grill to even be considered on a hidden gem list."

The owner served it to us, and my g/f ate a few fries, then cut the burger in half, then realized she had been served the wrong burger. Owner took it back.  A few minutes later she served that same burger to the adjacent table and apologized for cutting it in half ""because she thought you guys wanted it that way"". So, served them the burger we had handled.  Kinda gross. We won't go back."

kzoo,309loy,smegma_legs,8,Thu Mar 26 16:52:12 2015 UTC,"Bangkok Flavor out on Gull Road is worth the drive for the best Thai food in the area. Shawarma King on Drake has amazing and cheap sandwiches, it's my favorite Kzoo restaurant, don't bother with the entree plates though (the one on Westnedge is good too, but totally unrelated to the one on Drake, they just have the same name). El Gallo Blanco is some of the best Mexican. Oakwood Bistro is a neighborhood place with a nice wine list and thin crust pizza. Beer Exchange actually has good food in addition to the beer selecetion. Hunan Garden on West Main has decent noodle soup and other Chinese dishes. If you want something fancier, Martel's has okay food but the real draw is the outdoor seating in the summer next to the lake. For fine dining, Rustica is also tasty."
kzoo,309loy,eratoast,3,Wed Mar 25 18:53:34 2015 UTC,"the shawarma king on westnedge is an all you can eat buffet, which is worth mentioning.  You can take out a box and they charge you by weight, but it's not too unfair.  I usually get a heaping plate of the shawarma beef and slather it in the garlic sauce."
kzoo,309loy,Gigantic_Brain,1 point,Thu Mar 26 08:59:10 2015 UTC,I used to work on Gull and ate Bangkok Flavor twice a week usually. Amazing food. Reasonable price. Usually gets busy during lunch time.  El Gallo Blanco has great lengua tacos. I just wish it had a liquor license!   University Roadhouse has pretty good food and a wide variety on their menu. I realize it's more of a campus spot but usually the crowd is old and young mixed.
kzoo,309loy,urbaneyezcom,1 point,Wed Mar 25 22:34:47 2015 UTC,I drive past Bangkok Flavor probably twice a week and never think to go there. I'll definitely try it out.

Edit: don't be shocked by having to wait. The place is small and always busy but the longest I've ever waited is thirty minutes. Well worth it.   Also Martini's has great pizza.  Martell's is good but much more pricey.   If you're looking for a dive bar, Green Top Tavern has surprisingly good burgers, like really good, for a shitty little bar.  Saffron is pretty great. They do a lunch buffet which is a cool way to experience Indian food if you've never had it.  Three Amigos has pretty decent Mexican, not amazing but passable. They overpour on Margaritas so it's a cheap way to have drink in the evenings."

kzoo,3092kb,fweilatan,5,Wed Mar 25 13:51:58 2015 UTC,"It's potentially going to be a little bit more than you want to spend (maybe not by much, though) but look at Drake's Pond.  I know they allow dogs, and there are some trails behind it.  It has some nice amenities, too.  Dover Hills is just down from Drake's Pond and is a decent place to live for the money.  If you are on the correct end, you will be next to a big church which has a huge yard they let people run their dogs in.  At least, I've never seen anyone get told not to.  The absolute best trails in the area right at an apartment complex is Parkview Hills.  Awesome walking trails.  A lot of the people that live there are older retiree types.  Not an old folks home at all, just tends to have an older crowd.  Two thoughts for you: 1) The closer you get to campus, the more it's going to be college kids, obviously. 2) Not many people actually live downtown, but it's a small enough town that anywhere you live will feel close enough.  I live farther away than any place I mentioned and getting downtown for a night out is not a big deal at all."
kzoo,3092kb,Malakus,1 point,Wed Mar 25 14:16:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response! I'm surprised that more people don't live downtown, it looks really nice but I'm only judging that off of Google images and no prior knowledge of the city lol.   I'm glad you mentioned the college kids situation. I value my sleep more than anything and having noisy 19 year old neighbors is my nightmare."
kzoo,3092kb,Malakus,4,Wed Mar 25 14:47:04 2015 UTC,"They made downtown expensive to live in.  I think the developers were expecting more people to value living downtown then they do.  Downtown was NOT a destination for people in this area 15 years ago, but they cleaned it up really well.  When developers bought the buildings for apartments they overpaid and charge way too much for rent.  And like I said, everything is so close to downtown there is not point in actually living there so it kind of bit them in the ass.  People still live down there, but it's not a destination."

kzoo,3092kb,KestrelLowing,1 point,Wed Mar 25 15:06:20 2015 UTC,"The West Main area is great. Lots of things to do in that area and also a straight shot into downtown. I think with any apartment complex you are going to find positive and negative things but Summer Ridge seems like a nice option. It's not crazy expensive, you can have animals (last I knew), and it's close to the Kal-Haven trail. And I don't think a TON of students live there.  I live in Parchment which is 5 minutes NE of downtown but there aren't really apartments there. I'm guessing there are some houses for rent but not positive. It is right next to the Kzoo River Valley Trail though which is GREAT in the summer and can take you right downtown too. I've ridden my bike to the bars downtown a few times and it's nice not having to worry about getting run over on the road."
kzoo,3092kb,Bamchuck,1 point,Wed Mar 25 16:20:20 2015 UTC,Another Parchment redditor!?!?  I second what he/she said. If Parchment had more apartments I'd definitely recommend it. It's close enough to downtown to be city-esque but quiet too. Spent 18 years growing up there. Loved it
kzoo,3092kb,Bamchuck,2,Sun Apr 12 03:52:09 2015 UTC,"You may want to look at Greenhill Apartments.  (It's currently where I live).  It's a little further away from downtown than you might want (go on West Main for about 2 miles), but it's smack dab next to Western and yet isn't very ""college apartment complex"" - there are families, grad students, young professionals, as well as some undergrads.  The best thing though is this apartment complex is enthusiastically dog friendly.  There's an on-site dog park (split to 25lbs and below and 25lbs and above), and poop cans and bags everywhere.  Also, while the trails aren't extensive, there are trails around the buildings that are semi-wooded and go around the two ponds.  The trails actually lead to Western's Campus.  We actually really like it.  The maintenance guys have been very attentive, and the sound proofing is awesome.  Next door has a baby and we rarely hear them.  Maybe we've just got quiet neighbors and we're the assholes who are loud, but it's super nice.  The rent isn't super cheap, but I don't know exactly what range you're looking at.  1 bedroom is $740 for the cheapest units they have.  Anyway, just wanted to bring that up as I really enjoy it here.  We're in the process of trying to buy a house so we'll hopefully be leaving relatively soon, but I've enjoyed it while I've lived here."
kzoo,3092kb,chipsnguac,1 point,Wed Mar 25 17:51:49 2015 UTC,"Look at the map of the Kalamazoo River Valley Trail and Kal-Haven.  You can start just north of downtown and head west to the beach.  Only issue is a couple of miles on Ravine Rd that are ""trail"" and also the shoulder of the road. The trail is paved east of 10th street and gravel west of 10th street.   As far as housing, downtown can be a bit expensive for the nicer apartments. The graduate stipend pays about 20k per year if you get paid through the summer at the PhD level, so it may not be possible. There is a student ghetto area in the vine and westnedge hill neighborhoods where a lot of houses are for rent. It's a quick walk downtown from either of those, but there are no trails to speak of in those areas.   Personally, I think the west side of kalamazoo is the easiest for your situation. There are some decent bars on West Main (Hangar), some decent food (Zooroona, Saffron), easy access to campus and downtown, and some of the better apartment communities (Drake's pond, Summer ridge), best grocery store access, (meijer, costco, harding's, nhc (for the tofu crowd))  When my wife and I first got to kzoo we lived at Summer Ridge... It's a short walk to a shopping center to pick up the bus. Kalamazoo Metro buses are free to WMU students, so we could jump on the downtown line and head out to some of the downtown bars and restaurants without worrying about driving (they stop running at like 11).   The breweries and brewpubs are mostly all downtown, so that kinda sucks living on the westside, but we get down there enough.  Anyways, welcome to kzoo, congrats on the program acceptance, and good luck..."
kzoo,3092kb,wise_whywolf,1 point,Wed Mar 25 15:14:20 2015 UTC,You can walk right up the sidewalk on drake to get to the KRVT-Kal Haven trail...  should have mentioned that about westside as well

They know the guys that run Alliance AZO in Kalamazoo and they highly recommend Alliance for BJJ, MMA, Muay Thai. Maybe they'd be a good place to train. Practically everything else in town looks like your basic McDojo."

I've worked with a few UFC guys and the gym I work at/out of is really cool, in regards to being non-meatheaded, non-hyper aggressive weirdos. I've had some issues in the past with working with guys who overkill, especially since I don't have any intention of ever cutting weight and fighting again in my life.  I mostly just like the training and the sparring, and the teaching."

They have the best and highest ranking BJJ coaches in the area (me- Ben Lindhout- 1 stripe brown belt Carlson Gracie Team), and 2 other purple belts close to brown.  They are connected with GRBJJ in Grand Rapids, who is owned by Clint Crabtree, the only legit BJJ black belt in West Michigan.  Lightning Kicks has several pro MMA fighters, and also TKD, Hapkido, and Wrestling programs.    Amir also runs a non-profit program at the school to help at risk youth in the community."

kzoo,2z5xqm,BACquestion,2,Sun Mar 15 21:42:19 2015 UTC,"Apply for the service desk, deli, the weight room attendant, or locker room attendant. There is a pretty high turn over so chances you will get a call back are pretty good. Working there didn't suck, but when I was there they were pretty disorganized and the shift schedule was only 4 hour shifts, which worked fine while I was in school."
kzoo,2z5xqm,muellberggeist,1 point,Mon Mar 16 04:02:07 2015 UTC,"Can you give any more information on weight room attendant or locker room attendent. Like what exactly do you do if you're an attendent of one of them, if you know. Also, the 4 hour shift is perfect for me, I don't need a lot of hours. Like 16 hours would be more than enough for me. You said it was disorganized, care to explain any further on that? Also, how long ago did you work there? Thanks a lot."
kzoo,2z5xqm,muellberggeist,1 point,Mon Mar 16 13:21:17 2015 UTC,"Getting shifts covered was pretty difficult (they had rules that effectively discouraged having people that only took sub shifts), and sometimes actually getting the shifts you want could be difficult.  Weight room attendant just wipes down machines, keeps the weight room organized, and provides spots for people that may ask. It's best if you know a good deal about lifting so you can answer people's questions if they have any. Locker room attendants pick up towels, wash towels, fold towels, and keep the locker room tidy, including filling up soaps and lotions. None of it is very difficult. The locker rooms get very busy though at times so it can be annoying. I worked there for three or four years, mostly as a life guard and a locker room attendant. I quit last march."

As long as it could fit that schedule would be swell. Also, thanks for the extra info on the jobs. Question about the locker room though, do they have to do any actual ""janitorial"" jobs?

The Kalamazoo area is really cheap, is a college town, has plenty of great parks, and while the nightlife doesn't hold a candle to a place like Chicago there are some great bars in the area."

kzoo,2yr2a9,scumshot,15,Thu Mar 12 02:24:47 2015 UTC,"I think my friend summed it up best - ""Bell's likely doesn't have an issue with Innovation, but is instead creating a history of defending its name and slogans in the legal system by objecting to Innovation's trademark application. That way if someone else down the road creates something that actually infringes on the Bell's brand, when they take that entity to court they can prove that they've objected to such actions in the past and stand a better chance of winning. It sounds super douchey at first glance but Innovation will likely be awarded its trademark application and Bell's will be able to say they pay attention to such things for future reference, which is what both parties actually want.""  actual response from Bells - ""To our Bell's customers and the passionate craft beer community,  We want to clear up a few things regarding our federal trademark dispute with Innovation Brewing.  We have not, and are not asking them to change their name or their logo. There is no lawsuit. We are not suing them. We have not asked them for money. We have not asked them to stop selling their beer. We are asking them to withdraw their federal trademark application. Our concern is with their United States trademark application and potential impact on our brand, which we have spent 30 years building. I personally reached out to Innovation Brewing to try to settle this matter in February, 2014 and attempted to talk about this brewer to brewer instead of involving lawyers. Our efforts were rebuffed and Innovation Brewing choose to pursue this in the legal system. Over the last year, we have offered co-existence agreements and have offered to pay for their legal fees. We tried to find solutions that would work for both of us. Their response was to ask for an exorbitant amount of money and we did not feel that was a collaborative solution. All offers that we proposed were rejected and after more than a year of discussion regrettably, this matter has moved to the federal trademark office. We have the utmost respect for Innovation Brewing and we are going to keep any comments we have regarding this matter positive, honest, and collaborative. We want them to continue to brew and do the good work they're doing under their own name.  We hope to resolve this as swiftly as the system will allow.  The passion that we have seen over the past few days is a testament to how much the beer industry means to those who support it and why we are proud to be a part of it. We always appreciate further feedback and invite everyone to continue to share their concerns with us directly: http://bellsbeer.com/contact/."""
kzoo,2yr2a9,vingt_et_un,7,Thu Mar 12 15:47:18 2015 UTC,"""Don't hate the player, hate the game"" comes to mind. Trademark and copyright laws in the U.S. are crazy and while it can create a PR nightmare, Bell's is doing the right thing here. I think most of the backlash is coming from people who aren't getting the whole truth. Bell's isn't trying to shut down or make a small brewery change their name; they are trying to protect their own brand now and for the future."
kzoo,2yr2a9,indyjones85,4,Thu Mar 12 15:59:58 2015 UTC,"Innovation responded to Bell's defense on their FB - the drama intensifies! Asheville NC is going all out boycott on Bell's apparently, with bars pulling their products and cancelling tastings, so it looks like cooler heads are not going to prevail there any time soon.   Innovation response  Edit: also interesting to point out: Innovation has sold out of beer and has made a LOT of friends through this fiasco, so despite their apparently high legal costs, they seem to be getting a lot of great publicity from this."
kzoo,2yr2a9,diyorgasms,6,Thu Mar 12 22:17:16 2015 UTC,I thought trademarks had to be non-generic to be enforceable. Isn't Bell's running the risk of losing this particular trademark if they litigate this?

They'll probably lose, but they have to make a show anyway.   That being said, this does look pretty bad for them.

I'm waiting to see what this ""reaching out to them brewer to brewer "" actually entailed - their saying that Innovation has chosen to take this up in the courts is strange, though. It will be interesting to see how this plays out. This statement seems like some serious lawyer-speak.  Edit: Bell's fanboys are downvoting my posts? Classy."
kzoo,2yr2a9,vingt_et_un,1 point,Thu Mar 12 18:51:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah I thought that was odd too. Obviously the VP of Bell's is trying to sugarcoat what actually happened to appear as positively as possible publicly without committing perjury so there's that. But even so, I think the OP article was far too opinionated. They certainly tried to paint the picture of a big-bad-company stomping all over the poor-little-guy. I suspect that, in reality, the truth of the situation lies in the middle. Both sides are probably acting like shit-heads."
kzoo,2yr2a9,ChibiLlama,1 point,Thu Mar 12 19:19:48 2015 UTC,I can't imagine this is any danger of bankrupting them. They're incredibly profitable and basically have a standing offer to get bought by one of the big national breweries at any time for hundreds of millions of dollars.

It's a ridiculous lawsuit - read the article.  Edit: read the second paragraph of the article.  Edit 2: interesting - read your other comment that Bell's is likely doing this to set a pattern of defending its brand. Hope this is true and that it ends well for both parties!  Edit 3: # After reading Innovation's response, while it is not technically a lawsuit, it seems to entail the same costs. The defense that ""we are not suing them"" is an entirely semantic response."

They have all of their cars online to look at with a carfax for all of them. They have a no haggling policy and the lowest prices within 300 miles (guaranteed by them). They also have a 30 day return policy and free shipping of your car. Both me and a friend have bought cars from them recently.

kzoo,2y9uvw,keldoftheisles,6,Sun Mar 8 02:35:20 2015 UTC,"I guess I just don’t understand.  They go to one of the most expensive and exclusive colleges in the world, in order to prepare for the real world.But they want a place to hide from the real world.  So, let me get this straight.   These people (the few that are vocal) are not comfortable around people who are not like them. They want a separate facility so they can stay sheltered and away from people who are not like them. They want someone else to pay for that facility:They are not willing to have a fundraiser or take up donations…They just want to whine that someone else must do it. If you do not completely agree with what they say and do, you are a racist and they have even re-classified any word or gesture that cannot easily be categorized as racist by any normal standard is re-classified as a ""micro-aggression.""   I attended WMU while a good friend of mine went to K at the same time. These ""problems"" they have on campus are not actual, real world problems. These are the problems that rich kids have after they leave the comfort of their parents house and are exposed to the world for the first time.   How may of these types of situations are WMU/MSU/U of M/ Central/Northern/GVSU, etc, exposed to each year? I dont know that answer, but, since most of those schools have their very own, dedicated police force, I'd have to imagine more than K college.   Kalamazoo College students have one of the most secure campus' in the state. It's small, compact, and easily accessible from multiple access points.   But yes, I really feel bad that you have to listen to other people speak their minds and disagree with your own personal opinions. You should build them their own building, away from everyone else, where they can freely discuss things, that might upset your narrow view of how the world actually is."

The crime rate for their campus must also be one of the lowest in the nation.  Other than ""microagressions"", which the validity of that concept is still contested (much like 99% of the things feminists rip out of sociology text books), there is almost no reason for any of these people to feel unsafe whatsoever."

kzoo,2xf7yr,skynectar,5,Sat Feb 28 02:21:32 2015 UTC,Many public schools are usually open to anyone just as long as you aren't getting in the way of the schools practices. There are also parks all over Portage and Oshtemo that have fields.
kzoo,2xf7yr,MasterFrills,5,Sat Feb 28 05:07:20 2015 UTC,I believe you can use the two fields by Western's Valley dorms as well. The soccer team for Western uses the fields by the engineering college so the ones on campus are almost always open.
kzoo,2xf7yr,TheSaintlyOne,3,Sat Feb 28 05:53:15 2015 UTC,"Almost every KPS Elementary school has soccer fields that you can play on. Just no nets set up.   I know when I went to King-Westwood they 2 small fields set up with goals with plastic cage-like nets. Indian Prairie has full sized field and goal posts. (I believe Arcadia has the same set up) Hillside and South have football fields with the field goal posts that double as goal posts. Kalamazoo Central has the practice football field right next to the baseball field with at least one goal post set up.   Western's IM fields are large enough, you would just have to bring cones  Most of the public parks also have either goals set up or big enough fields that you could set up cones.   If they haven't changed the park on 9th St just south of Stadium they have a large field and goal posts"
kzoo,2xf7yr,HyphySymphony,2,Sat Feb 28 14:05:50 2015 UTC,"Upjohn park, but you'll probably want to call the parks department to make sure that the field isn't reserved. It rarely is."

Upjohn park at the corner of crosstown and vine in Kalamazoo is public.   There are also open fields at river oaks park between Kalamazoo and Galesburg. They are frequently used by the Mexican leagues in town."
kzoo,2xf7yr,mygoodfriendbaxter,1 point,Sat Feb 28 17:46:49 2015 UTC,upjohn park is across from bronson along vine and something or other.  real world names make things much more clear for people looking for directions

kzoo,2xf7yr,dogebutter,2,Sun Mar 1 23:18:22 2015 UTC,"The Kalamazoo Community Soccer Complex (901 S Drake, behind Calvary Bible Church) and the Portage Soccer Complex (4422 Bishop Ave in Portage) both have a bunch of fields with nets. I don't know anything about their rules on public use when the fields aren't being used (or what the park hours are), but they are at least two locations that you can stop by to take a look at and see if they would be available when you want to use them."

kzoo,2x8n2j,CRIZZLEC_ECHO,5,Thu Feb 26 15:29:00 2015 UTC,"I'll admit to stalking your comments for sec, and I see that you're moving (back?) here.    As the other person posted, you want to look at the ""student ghetto"" for cheap studio apartments in kzoo.  Some of them are really nice, and some of them suck.  You have to make sure to see them in person and check out the street before signing a lease.  One block of the same street can very widely in terms of quality apartment and safety.    Also, you mentioned Three Rivers, and I guaruntee you will find much better rental rates in outlying areas like Three Rivers but you have to commute into town (about 30 minutes).  Vicksburg & Schoolcraft are closer and are really nice towns with about a 10 minute commute and are also much cheaper.  On the other side of town you have Oshtemo which might be pricier.  Focus on the student ghetto in kzoo and just google the rental companies.  But see the places in person first.  Also, good luck with the radio career.  Make sure to check WRKR, WKFR, WZOX and WZUU... at least RKR seems always to be hiring, if only in the sales department."
kzoo,2x8n2j,rchase,2,Thu Feb 26 18:10:58 2015 UTC,Yep covering all my bases. Especially since WKZO has posted the same job listing for a year now. Hopefully they're desperate and not just building up a large supply of replacements if someone threatens to quit.

kzoo,2x8n2j,Pinkvomit,2,Fri Feb 27 02:07:55 2015 UTC,"The student ghetto definitely varies greatly block to block. I've noticed you can gleam some information by driving around a bit early on trash day (Monday). The noisier, more compacted bits of the neighborhood tend to have more or overflowing trash bins.   Dunno why I notice shit like that."
kzoo,2x8n2j,diyorgasms,2,Thu Mar 5 03:58:44 2015 UTC,Craigslist is a good source to find what you're looking for.
kzoo,2x8n2j,diyorgasms,1 point,Thu Feb 26 17:34:16 2015 UTC,Best thing to look for is studios or 1-br apartments in some of the big old houses that have been carved up into apartments. You'll find most of those near downtown.

kzoo,2wy23s,IndigoHero,5,Tue Feb 24 03:04:22 2015 UTC,"This is good to see. A recent This American Life episode goes into a little more detail about the racial profiling training that they referenced. I hope the results here are as good as they have been in Vegas.  I recently moved here from Louisiana and it's been really strange to see how racially segregated this city is compared to down south. A lot of people up here think of the south as being much more racially divided, and there's some truth to that in some ways, but there's a conversation about it down there. And to come up here and clearly see strictly black and strictly white parts of town, with almost no overlap, is really shocking."
kzoo,2wy23s,robobot,3,Tue Feb 24 03:27:38 2015 UTC,Wow I always thought we were not only diverse but I swear I see more mixed (AA parent and caucasian parent) people here than anywhere else I visit. I've got a friend from Detroit that's visited here and call's Kalamazoo the mixed people capitol of Michigan jokingly. You will of course see areas predominately white people considering there are so many more but besides the North side everywhere else seems reasonably diverse to me considering economics and population percentages. I guess I need to visit Louisiana lol.
kzoo,2wy23s,Macboogie,3,Tue Feb 24 10:11:22 2015 UTC,"The way the city is physically structured actually has something to do with it. North street should connect to the West Main area if any amount of sense were to be had - but it dead ends near Western instead - cutting off a predominantly white area (W. Main) from a predominantly black area (North side).   Westnedge Hill - Mostly White Milham - Mostly White Winchell - Mostly White Vine - Mostly College South Side - Mostly Black E. Main - Mostly Black and Comstock   You'll also notice that whenever someone posts in this sub asking where they should move to, it's never E. Main, South Side, or North Side. Vine is an iffy.  There are predominant racial/classist lines in Kalamazoo. While there may be a lot of mixed families (which is true), you'll probably find that most of those are still in the predominantly black neighborhoods.   There is a lot of diversity here - but it's not very well mixed together."
kzoo,2wy23s,FlintGrey,2,Tue Feb 24 12:05:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not totally convinced this is entirely true. These lines are predominantly income lines.  I'd be interested in seeing census data to back this up.  Just based on driving through each neighborhood it seems true, but as a white guy who lives off east main (I think I haven't updated my flair in a while) I can say you can't judge a book by it's cover."
kzoo,2wy23s,Ecualung,3,Tue Feb 24 13:01:41 2015 UTC,"I'm white, I've lived in various places around town my whole life, I grew up on E. Main and on the outskirts of the south side. I spent the last 4.5 years in Vine, and now I live downtown. Just because these neighborhoods are heavily one race does not exclude others from being there too.  It's true that most of the lines are more classist than racist, but it's not really possible to separate that from the fact that most black people are on the poorer side of classism.   I'm also not saying that any of this is done purposefully (not anymore at least). It just happens to be where the lines fall."
kzoo,2wy23s,Ecualung,3,Tue Feb 24 13:10:37 2015 UTC,"I'm also not saying that any of this is done purposefully (not anymore at least).   There almost certainly WAS a great deal of purposeful residential segregation in Kalamazoo up until uncomfortably recently. Even though ""redlining"" and other such tactics may not be as common now as they were, the effects of that will last a long time as they create patterns and habits that are perpetuated.  As Midwestern cities go, I agree that Kalamazoo is not so badly segregated as some places. But it's certainly a factor."
kzoo,2wy23s,Macboogie,1 point,Tue Feb 24 20:50:30 2015 UTC,"Yeaaaaah. The story of integration (rather, the very resistant integration) of Norrix is more than enough to feel uneasy about Kalamazoo's late-ness to the ""let's try to not be racist"" club."

De-segregating the schools was an issue. Getting students of color into the Loy Norrix halls took far longer than it should have, even after segregated school systems had become illegal."

kzoo,2x2l77,platoreborn,2,Wed Feb 25 05:04:16 2015 UTC,"Never been there.  Googled.  Looked at the menu.  Looks pretty hipsterish to me.  I kind of object to restaurants using the word ""dollops"" to describe their pizza sauce.   The pizza market is a tough niche to get people to try.  Like, we go to Cottage Inn because they deliver to our area.  They are decent and not horribly priced.   Erbelli's also delivers to our area, but we are too cheap to buy it, even though they are a bit better.  I consider them pricey.   When we have kids over, it's cheap delivery of Pizza Hut.   The best Pizza in Kalamazoo is Bimbos (not overpriced Bilbos).  I only eat there on rare occasions, because we don't go downtown that much and when we do, it's not for Pizza.  Bottom line, I just don't know if I need another pizza option in my life.    I am pretty pissed though that there are no decent Mexican Restaurants on the West side since Mi Ranchito was changed to that Manga place.  So gross.  If I wanted Italian, I would go to Erbellis again."

Bimbo's is great, and Bilbo's is only good for their salad dressing (which is fantastic).. their pizza is overpriced, and always undercooked (note: I worked there for 2 years back a college like, 30million year ago).  Also, I see you're on the west side and miss Mi Ranchito (which was also amazing), but when yer on Westnedge try Riviera Maya if you haven't already.  It's pretty great, family owned, and usually not very busy (which makes me nervous given how many joints have failed at that location over the years.)"

I go to Mexico every year actually on the Rivera Maya and um... they season their food with tomato, onion, and cilantro.  Rivera Maya is horrible, bland shit.  Seriously terrible food.   If you want good Mexican you need to go to Cancun in Paw Paw or El Gallo Blanco in Kalamazoo.  Both are actually authentic, and reasonably priced.  Even though Blanco has shitty servers and has raised their prices TWICE in the past year since they have become popular."

kzoo,2ws029,kimmychanga,6,Sun Feb 22 17:49:58 2015 UTC,"It's interesting to me that you say the size was an issue with K because I consider it one of K's best attributes. I've had a lot of great opportunities to establish helpful relationships with professors who truly care, take on leadership roles, and genuinely feel a part of a community. You are interacting with the same people everyday (especially once you limit down classes to ones that are relevant to your major [e.g. I never really interact with students who are in the sciences because I am now taking primarily political science and history courses]), but student organizations can help to break that. Make sure that you venture off campus as well, for Kalamazoo is bountiful & worth exploring. Even getting off campus once a week can help when K is feeling too contained. Overall, K has been good to me. I have been pushed academically further than I ever had been before, but in an attainable way with clear results in my critical thinking capabilities. If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask me."
kzoo,2ws029,houseboatbabies,9,Sun Feb 22 18:38:28 2015 UTC,"I'm a senior at K so I can offer some cynical perspective! I'll speak to your concerns first. The size can be an issue, and social life is cliquey as hell. There are a lot of pretentious idiots even though everyone's pretty smart, and the gossip mill is pretty extensive (and fun...just saying). The weather is unreliable but you get used to it, and honestly even if winter REALLY gets you down there are enough things to do to keep you busy.  K promises a lot more freedom to do what you want and engagement with community than is necessarily there. There are fewer study abroad options than they make it seem, and the program isn't run in the greatest way--lots of red tape and bullshit. Social justice is somewhere between a real thing, a hashtag, and an identity for metro Detroit white kids to justify gentrification. That being said, the reason I can level all those criticisms at K is because I have gotten a really good education. If you're looking for it, the classes you take at K can push you to break down and challenge everything you thought about the world, and I'm constantly looking at myself a few months ago and recognizing how much I've learned. It's competitive if you want it to be, but you can also disengage with a lot of things and live your life too. People drink a lot, but a lot of people don't drink; same goes for other drugs. StuComm is bullshit, StuOrgs are a way to get money out of their wallet, and phonathon sucks dick but is bearable for a paycheck.  I've got a lot of thoughts seeing as how I'm graduating soon so if you have any other questions PM me, I might not get back to you immediately though. You should check out Konfessions on Facebook for a look at anonymous rants by people on campus. One thing that you should seriously consider is the cost--tuition will be going up a minimum of 4% each year, possibly more because of a budget shortfall. Anyways, good luck on the search!"
kzoo,2ws029,dogebutter,3,Mon Feb 23 00:26:38 2015 UTC,Your description of social justice & StuComm is spot on. Bless you.
kzoo,2ws029,houseboatbabies,1 point,Mon Feb 23 04:38:46 2015 UTC,Can you speak a little more to the studying abroad? I'm considering K and this is a big factor.
kzoo,2ws029,ICanTrimYourArmor,3,Mon Feb 23 04:10:35 2015 UTC,"There are about 40 study abroad programs, but you can't just apply to all 40. It's not divided up by major so much as language ability, for example my program (Senegal) required French 201, while if you've taken beyond like 103 I think you can't go to Strasbourg where the classes are in English. There are a lot more Spanish-speaking programs, 2 in Spain and more in Latin America, which have a similar breakdown. Lots of programs have space for 12-18, but a few have only 2-5 spots and are more competitive--if you don't make it into your top choice you can pick another that has some open spots. A few programs have other requirements or focuses that make them more appropriate for some majors than others, like the cognitive science program in Budapest.  I was kinda exaggerating when I said there's ""lots"" of bullshit--there's as much as you would expect dealing with any institution. I couldn't get into my top choice of program for medical reasons, but they didn't tell me until I was halfway through the application over winter break. There are very few options if you want to do a program other than the ones they have organized, and you have to justify it as ""within the liberal arts tradition""--one of my friends wanted to work on and build sailboats through a program she knew and it got shot down. You will be shut down if you try and do anything other than what they want, and that sometimes goes for while you're abroad. Does that help at all?"

kzoo,2ws029,ICanTrimYourArmor,1 point,Tue Feb 24 16:44:11 2015 UTC,"Tbh I picked K for its study abroad programs and it ended up not being the most significant part of my time, but lots of people would say otherwise."
kzoo,2ws029,dogebutter,3,Tue Feb 24 20:18:53 2015 UTC,"Congrats!! I got accepted as well, and am going there this fall.   I wouldn't worry much about the weather in Kalamazoo; it's similar to all Michigan weather: snowy and cold in the winter. The nice thing is that K is a small campus, so you can walk to class in a quick time without having to bear the brunt of the cold. When I visited, my tour guide stated that everytime it snows, the sidewalks are immediately shoveled, so there's no worrying about slipping/trudging through snow. I loved that aspect, because my high school doesn't do that, and I have a long walk into school. K does cancel school, too, when the weather is gross.  Regarding other people's experiences at K, I know a few people who attended, and said that it was the best decision they've ever made. For example, a family friend went to K and then got a full-ride to Northwestern University for her grad school (she went into social advocacy/justice). She says that K prepared her not only as a student, but a human being, and helped her personally grow. The staff at K seem to really make the experience about you, and tailor their program to do so by cutting out pre-req classes and giving you great opportunities. All in all, K seems to be a wonderful place to go and learn. If you do go, message me so we can hang out! I'm the only girl from my high school who is going, and it'd be cool to meet new folks."
kzoo,2ws029,ThomasAK,3,Sun Feb 22 19:00:34 2015 UTC,"Hey, just so you know your tour guide told you a half truth--while on campus sidewalks are cleared quickly, Kalamazoo as a city is absolute shit at clearing sidewalks. It's the responsibility of the property owner, which means nobody does it, so more often than not if you're living off campus walking in the street is easier than taking the sidewalk when going to class. It shouldn't be a dealbreaker for you, I just wanted to clarify that you'll spend some time climbing over snow mounds and tiptoeing across ice."
kzoo,2ws029,dogebutter,3,Tue Feb 24 14:21:53 2015 UTC,"Hey, K College freshman here. Even though I'm only a first year, I really advocate K. I agree with others, the size is actually pretty great. Everyone knows everyone, meaning professors and students. The sense of community is really great. In contrast to /u/houseboatbabies though, I think that most people actually have a lot of friends outside of their intended majors, which actually can really help to enrich your education, as you tend to hear about things that you wouldn't talk about in your classes. The bubble doesn't bug me coming from a small town, but there's always plenty going on in town (just check the weekly weekend thread) especially in fall and spring quarter. Congrats to you, and to /u/ThomasAK and hopefully you guys enjoy your college search, good luck!"
kzoo,2ws029,JRokka2014,1 point,Sun Feb 22 19:15:24 2015 UTC,"Is it okay if I were to ask you a few questions about K? Like what your prospective major is, what clubs/organizations are good for freshmen, and any general advice you have for new K students?"
kzoo,2ws029,ThomasAK,2,Sun Feb 22 19:30:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for sure! I'm looking at Biology and Psychology double majors with a Neuroscience concentration, I recommend KCUF (Kalamazoo College Ultimate Frisbee) for some exercise and partying, and K Crew is a good way to meet a lot of people and get paid for helping out the school. There's lots of organizations based on hobbies too, like the outing club, game clubs, and stuff like that. As far as advice goes, meet people. Like, a lot of people. I talked to a decent amount of people from my class via facebook before i moved to campus, it gave me a good idea of who i did and didn't want to talk to. And since it's such a small school, you'll know everyone anyway. Like the other review said, some people can be pretty clique-y, but that hasn't been my general experience. IF there's anything else you'd like to know, feel free to PM me!"
kzoo,2ws029,JRokka2014,3,Mon Feb 23 04:32:49 2015 UTC,"K senior here.   Pros: -Small size. I know you list it as a con, but by senior year, you will know other students and professors in your department very well because of the small size. Getting advice, recommendations, connections, etc. is much easier. It's also easier to get to know people and K traditions like our Winter Scavenger hunt. -Study abroad. As dogebutter said, it's not a dreamland, but we have a big study abroad culture. More than 50% of students go abroad and so there are a lot of resources for working on applications and when you return, reintegration help. The school welcomes you back with a free hamburgers and pie event. -Senior Individualized Project- SIP. This is your undergrad thesis and depending on what department you do yours for, it is a launching point into the professional world and often gives you resume material. -Challenging classes. Tend to be discussion based. Freshmen all start out with a First Year Seminar on a topic of your choice which will really help you nail down how K classes work, and ease you into how we do things. -Kalamazoo is a pretty cool city, great for chill hipster art folk and beer.  Cons -Price. If you come here, have your finances figured out. If you're going to get a lot of debt, understand what it will be like to have it and what your potential for paying it off will be with whatever degree you get. K's pretty good about giving financial aid. -Weather. Yeah K is very good about shoveling the sidewalks but they just can't make the Lake Effect snow go away after a while. :( Dorms were always warm though.  Other notes:  K kids mostly hang around and drink while you visit your friends at Western parties if you want the authentic college party, join Humans vs Zombies, generally people are nerds, you will probably clash with a social justice person once even if you are a social justice person yourself.  Overall: I've had a good time here. It is the people I love the most. feel free to PM more questions. :)"

There is always stuff to do downtown, from festivals every weekend in the summer to cool and unique bars and places to eat. I wouldn't trade my 5 years in that city for anything in the world."
kzoo,2wrc8o,theconk,5,Sun Feb 22 13:52:45 2015 UTC,"Me too, the guy looked like a fucking bum. His hat and coat were filthy. Said I knew he was bullshit and pretty much slammed the door in his face. Consumer's came by yesterday to make sure there weren't any bogus charges on our bill, they know these guys are out there."
kzoo,2wrc8o,jesselikesfood,5,Sun Feb 22 15:56:45 2015 UTC,"I live in the Vine neighborhood - they were at my house three times in the last year! I wasn't here the first time, my wife said we weren't interested and sent them away. I did the same the second time. I was a bit surprised to see them back a third time. By this time I had already looked into them on the interwebs, figuring it was a scam.   I stopped them short when I opened the door, telling them that I'm not going to show them my bill, and that we told them twice we aren't interested. This seemed to upset the lead guy, who proceeded to angrily yell the rest of the sales pitch at me.   ""You mean you're not interested in saving money??!!""  ""I just need to see your bill!!""   ""I'll just put you down as a [I forgot the term he used,  but it basically tells future salesmen to keep coming back], someone will be back to talk to you in a couple weeks!""  I can't say that I've ever been threatened with business before. It was a little odd."
kzoo,2wrc8o,Thick-McRunFast,3,Mon Feb 23 03:59:25 2015 UTC,"I saw them walking through Oakwood the other day...All of them were wearing company jackets,though, so how you got a guy looking like a bum is beyond me.  I wouldn't sign up for anything being pitched by someone going door to door; it's just not a good business practice to do that.  Gives it a shady feel from the start if that is how you need to drum up business, especially for something like energy supplying."
kzoo,2wrc8o,dutchie727,3,Sun Feb 22 17:14:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had a visit as well.  I don't handle the bill, my wife does, I told dude (~22, dreads, a little sketchy, but friendly and well-spoken.)  I have no idea who these people are, but door to door sales always puts me off.  All that being said, Consumer's Energy isn't much better.  We've been battling those bastards about our bill for months, and they just can't seem to get it straight."
kzoo,2wrc8o,rchase,3,Sun Feb 22 17:55:33 2015 UTC,"They came by my place last summer, asked to see my consumers bill and I politely explained that I wasnt going to show my account information to a complete stranger.   The supervisor lady within earshot freaked out and accused me of implying they would switch my provider without my given consent. Explained to her its well documented that her company has since they were universal energy (2 or 3 company names ago) and they also go door to door because they arent even allowed to advertise in state. She saw it wasnt my first rodeo and they split.  I invested in a great no solicitors sign to hang on the door after that one."
kzoo,2wrc8o,SteveOnAPlane,2,Mon Feb 23 01:17:54 2015 UTC,They come around every year and hit a lot of neighborhoods all over. I believe that its just a middleman service that takes your bill from Consumers and tacks on their own service fees. Just make sure not to give them your Consumer's number.
kzoo,2wlvwb,theconk,3,Sat Feb 21 00:35:46 2015 UTC,"Welcome to Michigan!   Most places accept returns only for products they sell. (Meijer wont accept ""Sam's Choice"" brand soda cans sold only by Walmart)  You may have better luck at a Harding's. I don't know for sure but maybe Bell's general store accepts returns.  If you don't care about the deposit,  you could just put them out with normal city recycling  Edit:  I should add,  where ever you bought Bell's from and paid the deposit to, should also accept the returns."

kzoo,2wl1n8,desii721,3,Fri Feb 20 20:27:52 2015 UTC,"There are many factors that go into this (aren't there always?), but mostly it comes down to ""reasonable use & care"" of your apartment. In the case of frozen pipes, did you have the heat set to below 60F? Does your lease specify that faucets should be left dripping or other instructions for cold weather? If either is ""yes"" you may be on the hook for damage. Otherwise, it is the landlord's responsibility to keep such things in working order, including repair in a timely manner. Have you notified them yet (preferably in writing) of the problem? Have they said what and when they plan to do about it? Answers to all of these questions determine what would happen next."
kzoo,2wl1n8,StDoodle,1 point,Fri Feb 20 20:58:05 2015 UTC,Yeah. It wasn't anything we did in the apartment to cause it.  They told me someone left the door open to the water softener area over night which causes the pipes to burst for our building.   Only 1 apartment got flooded thankful it wasn't mine.     They got the water back on by 8pm.  I was just worried because of the weekend and never having gone through something like this.  I was a bit upset they didn't keep us informed.   I had to call a few times to ask.   Plus they didn't leave the clubhouse open later for us to use the restrooms.
kzoo,2wl1n8,higgles5,2,Sat Feb 21 14:34:47 2015 UTC,Usually apartment complexes inform their tenants if there is a possibility for pipes to freeze and recommend leaving a tap or two dripping to stop this from happening. I know this is what it's like at Anna's Vineyard where I am.

Decent schooling options (if you decide to breed), plus free college tuition for the kids if you stock around. Small community but pretty open to newcomers, easy to make connections. The community is quite artsy and well-educated overall, and more liberal than a lot of the surrounding state. Having grown up in Kzoo and had kids there, I can promise it's an excellent place to raise a family, but I couldn't personally imagine staying there in my 20s, I had to get out and see the world. Other people seem to enjoy it for that life period, however. And if you're into brewing, it's a great location to make connections with serious power names in the microbrewing world."

Kzoo definitely has some and GR has some as well but there are so many shows I would go see in Detroit or Chicago if they weren't so far away.  Pros: Tons of places to eat & drink (especially beer)  Lots of college/20-something people around the city (which means a lot of places stay open very late on the weekends).

kzoo,2vpyms,theconk,2,Wed Feb 25 01:08:17 2015 UTC,"Thai: I really like Thai cuisine on West main and Drake. However, the service can be slow/terrible so don't go for that. It's just about as good as no Thai minus the atmosphere.   Hunan gardens on West main and Drake has an authentic szechuan menu!  Vietnamese: kalamazoo surprisingly doesn't have any Vietnamese food. There is a pho place in GT. Chinn Chinns frequently has Vietnamese themed specials and has one dish on their menu I think, but it isn't very authentic. You might consider rasa ria, which is a Malaysian / Indonesian restaurant with fantastic curry. Mom and pop place. I really like the beef rendang and the fried rice, it's in a sweet soy sauce and has a whole fried egg on top :)  There's no real dim sum besides hibachi grill buffet on Westnedge but I didn't care for it a ton there. You can go to grand Rapids for more. However, the pupu platter at Chinn Chinn has quite a few amazing dumplings and I like it (though I have very little dim sum experience). My coworkers swear by wei wei palace in Grand Rapids but I've never been.   There isn't any specifically Cuban restaurants, but island fest has a few amazing Mediterranean vendors that show up to the festivals all summer. Unfortunately it can be festival pricing, so 6-8$ for a small serving of jerk chickem/beef. Good flavor though. Also, El inka on Drake road (by west main) is Peruvian food and has authentic flavor, but I assume there's some differences between Peruvian food and Cuban food :)  Hope this helps!"

There's an entire building downtown (the Park Trades Center) that contains nothing but studios and workshops for various artists and groups such as the Kalamazoo Glass Arts Center. Because of the huge college student population (3 schools: WMU, K College, and KVCC) we have lots of great bars, many of which brew their own beer, an endless list of fantastic places to eat, and live music everywhere you look. Every summer we host a ton of cultural festivals like Greekfest, Island Fest, Irish Fest, Beerfest, Ribfest, Blues Fest, Taste of Kalamazoo, etc.. These events bring in lots of local food and world-class entertainment and are generally a blast. Just this summer we had The Meditations, Augustana, Shenandoah, James Wesley, and Dennis DeYoung perform, and those were just the headliners that I ran sound for and can remember! In the past I know we've had Hoobastank, Skid Row, and lots of others.  Weather-wise, Kalamazoo has the extremes of all four seasons. In any given year there will be days above 100 degrees and days below 0. We get huge amounts of snow every winter.

My area isn't currently KZOO, which gets annoying when I get the Michigan Live Job emails about ""job fairs in Detroit, Kalamazoo, Grand Haven, Lansing"". It's kind of insulting to see ""oh sure, you can get a decent job here, all you need to do is travel 1400 miles risking lots of money on the hope of landing that job"".  I have the money to travel, I don't have the money to job-fair/job search just yet. I'm already prepared to throw out at least 1400$ to move, but only if that money is landing me the job (or the job in general) I trained 6 years for. For a place like ""Pure Michigan"" that boasts about wanting all the college grads they can get their hands on, they don't seem to have any openings for people outside of face-to-face interview range.   ""We want or need all of you, just spend all your savings to move here first, then we'll give you the job, honest we will, I swear to almighty Tim Allen we will"".   I have everything to lose by moving there now presuming I will get the job instantly, that's why I'm saving up thousands of dollars first. Because based on the job hunt so far, I'm very likely to be unemployed for at least the first two months of job hunting in-person in Michigan.   If it were as easy as the official employment website said, I could have moved there by August 2014."
kzoo,2vf252,CRIZZLEC_ECHO,1 point,Thu Feb 12 11:59:52 2015 UTC,"Sorry. Typo with the extra t.   Listen, this is how you do it:  Call contacting companies. These are companies like manpower, Robert Half or trillium. They place people who have no education all the way through executives. Tell them you are looking for any contacted position at any large company in the areas you prefer. You could say all of Michigan.   They will find you a job within a month. The corporation will pay the company $20 an hour and you get fifteen. You can continue with wherever you are living and you can commute until you are comfortable with the job / build up enough capital to move. You would think you can skip the middle man and keep the $5 for yourself but most corporate policy doesn't allow that. Also if your contact does end you can find another job through that same company.   Usually they have offices in every city in the USA, so you can just visit the branch closest to you and fill out paperwork and do drug testing there.   Don't put your eggs in one basket. Pure Michigan won't hire you until you get experience at this base level. If you're lucky like me the company will hire you from the contractor pool.   Also screw any mass job email like mlive jobs. Either go to specific corporate recruitment site and find job listing or use the contacting companies."

Other recommendations for a nice night out would depend on what style food you like and price you want to pay. Indian Food, go to Saffron on Westmain. If you like Middle Eastern food then I would definitely recommend Zooroona on Westmain; they have a wonderful atmosphere, great customer service, and amazing food. Any Millennium Group restaurant in Kalamazoo (my personal favorite is Fieldstone for their atmosphere and service). Zazios is an Italian restaurant and has a chef's table if that's your desire, but it is pricey and I have heard mixed reviews. Fandango is fun, but usually better with a group as it is a tapas restaurant (each person orders 2 dishes or so and everyone shares) and it is very pricey."

kzoo,2uwsy9,SilentStryk09,3,Thu Feb 5 20:56:30 2015 UTC,"The rumor was that fleck had an affair with a member of the Zeigler family. It has since been redacted from that site by legal action, which is likely why MLive isn't posting it either."

I have no dog in the fight but if someone stated something about you as fact online and people started sourcing it like it was the gospel, wouldn't you be upset? People generally don't file defamation suits if they know the rumor is true b/c they have to prove the falsity.  Assuming this is false, I don't know why you would hate on them for trying to protect their name, which is closely tied to their business interest and also their donor interest toward WMU."

It is named after American entertainer Barbra Streisand, whose 2003 attempt to suppress photographs of her residence in Malibu, California inadvertently drew further public attention to it. Similar attempts have been made, for example, in cease-and-desist letters to suppress numbers, files, and websites. Instead of being suppressed, the information receives extensive publicity and media extensions such as videos and spoof songs, often being widely mirrored across the Internet or distributed on file-sharing networks.

I'm not much of a sports guy, the only sports I watch are eSports, like Halo tournaments (I used to play semi-pro Halo: Reach) and SSB Melee, or Project M. So sports aren't really my thing. I do like craft beer and I really like that there are so many great craft beer places around here. I've been a musician all my life realistically. Middle and High School band (Clarinet) and I've played in several bands over the years (Drums.) I went to college for audio production so I'm musically adept. I try to make it to all the local shows I hear about so I can take my Nikon and snag some photos.

kzoo,2ugfqn,thatoneguy54,3,Mon Feb 2 14:53:22 2015 UTC,"It will help those that are used to having and using a pocket knife as a valuable tool for their chosen line of work - such as theatre design and tech.  It seems crazy to me that when I go work for a public high school that I can take a pocket knife with me and have it on me on school grounds, but I can't do that at college.  I have also been in scouting for 14 years and know how to properly care for and use a pocket knife since I have been since I was 10.   I also strongly dislike the ban on non-lethal self defense items such as pepper spray.  I believe that they should allow a student to cerry pepper spray if they have been properly trained to do so - why not make it a one-credit course and make some money off it for the school in the process since that is a lot of that this buisness cares about (see: course packs)?  It doesn't take a long time to learn how to properly use and carry pepper spray either, I was taught and trained to properly do so when I worked at a Sheriff's office.

Let's assume that your dad would be 70 for the sake of math. That means he would've started high school in the '44/'45 school year most likely. Unfortunately it doesn't look like the yearbooks go back that far. If he was attending UAB when he met your mom, he would likely be significantly younger, maybe attending high school in the mid to late '60s. You might also try checking the UAB yearbook archives, but the digitized versions only go up to '62 so far. If you're a local of Alabama or willing to make the trip, university archive curators are usually more than happy to help you out. Make sure to email or call ahead so they can pull collections in preparation for you.  Source: I've dug through some university archives before in search of specific information.

As mentioned already, ATT owns Cricket so coverage is essentially identical.  They also just upped their high speed data limits so with auto pay your payments break down to this:  $35 for 2.5 GB of data  $45 for 5 GB of data  $55 for 10 GB of data   They added a new plan just yesterday which is $55 for 20 GB of data."

kzoo,2tw9d1,keldoftheisles,8,Wed Jan 28 14:44:35 2015 UTC,It matters because the reason that it exists is largely to provide a private space in which to have sex. Why you see it as trashy to have sex in an environment dedicated to that purpose is beyond me.
kzoo,2tw9d1,rich_ard,-2,Wed Jan 28 15:01:29 2015 UTC,"I'll accept that it's a dedicated environment when you can pull something out of your ass that isn't anecdotal conjecture.  In the real world, you have to realize that a hot tub garden is a place for people to enjoy the relaxing soak of a hot tub, chiefly because that is its sole stated purpose. Is the consumer supposed to suss out innuendo and rumor too? No, because that's idiotic. So how then are you supposed to know the environment is dedicated to a non-standard purpose? Since you have no way of knowing, the only alternative is that you default to treating it as a public space. There is no reason to think otherwise.  Again, you seem to think that this behavior is all very fine, because the garden is actually dedicated to the purveying of fuck-booths. But there's no evidence to suggest that's true, only, ""because it is"".  It is discourteous to the users of what is demonstrably a public space (with no reasonable way of knowing otherwise) who fully expect it to be treated as such, that others are treating it as a place to play 90 seconds in heaven.  So deferential treatment of a space used by others goes right out the window if they're not in the know about the unwritten rules of an unfamiliar place? But it's their fault for not knowing, of course.  By the way, park benches are the hottest new spot to shit your pants. There's nothing trashy about shitting your pants on a park bench.

First, it's a private space, and I think that it's pretty common knowledge that 'hot tub parlors' are commonly used for screwing in.   I'll accept that it's a dedicated environment when you can pull something out of your ass that isn't anecdotal conjecture.   I'll happily sign an affidavit to the effect that I have had long discussions with the owner of the facility, with whom I have a business relationship, and that he confirmed that the 'gardens' are meant for such.  And I'm not clear on why it makes any difference to you what happened in the room prior to your entrance. Hot tubs are gross - it's a container of water hot enough to force its inhabitants to sweat - and the facility is kept clean in order to encourage repeat business of any stripe."

kzoo,2try3x,diyorgasms,0,Mon Jan 26 23:14:47 2015 UTC,"There's a ton going on here behind the scenes.  I have a few connections inside the administration and also within the college of arts and sciences.  The first thing to point out, is that despite his continued focus on gender equality at WMU, Tim Greene is constantly under attack from the union for every little thing he does. When he first called for the study, he was attacked by the union. When he pointed out that there was a reverse-gender-pay-gap in some departments, he was attacked. When he issued a stipend to help counteract the gender pay gap, giving out quite a bit of money (3-6k for the year for many faculty) he was attacked. He gets attacked over and over again, and his job may be the hardest on all of WMU's campus.  Secondly, the actions of Enyedi are out of line. He is known at WMU for causing trouble and working against the administration. In this case, he issued a gift to certain employees at the CAS at his discretion that was seen as unfair to other employees. It was directly stepping on the Provosts toes and ruining the chain of command.  Thirdly, this isn't the first time a ""vote of no confidence"" has been cast on Tim Greene by the union. They do this pretty regularly, and it means nothing to anyone. Have any of these things EVER impacted students? Only in that students feel obliged to get involved, especially students that are teaching or administration students that look in extra close. No CAS or engineering student would ever notice any of this.  Tim has to answer to the president and the board of trustees. The deans are his employees that report to him. If an employee directly goes against and undermines the wishes of a provost, he deserves to get fired.  The fact that the union muddles everything up is just annoying and makes it feel like the provost is in some way wrong.  I'd love to hear other perspectives!"
kzoo,2try3x,bbqturtle,3,Tue Jan 27 14:29:23 2015 UTC,"this is fascinating stuff, but the wishy-washy perspective that i believe is what the media is trying to instill in the masses here is that the gender pay gap is a little silly, and that someone who did something about it should be championed, and the mean old tightwad provost is an evil bastard. the petition that is circulating has a mention of pj fleck and his 800k salary, etc.   its easy to make the standard argument about wmu having skewed priorities, don't upset the current administration, etc. do you have any perspective as to who is really the protagonist and antagonist in this, so to speak? i've lived here for quite some time and can't remember the last time i was like man, i'm so glad western decided to do that. i can, however, remember many a time i have questioned their motives and methods, especially since this new administration.   i have no horse in this race, and my horse couldn't row a boat anyways so some more insider perspective would be appreciated. i'm tired of mlive. thanks for posting =)"
kzoo,2try3x,dirtytom,1 point,Tue Jan 27 16:35:18 2015 UTC,"First thought: Life doesn't always have antagonists and protagonists. It's better to focus on outcomes of actions than if someone is inherently bad or good. Usually everyone is trying their hardest to do what seems right, which is usually closer to your own values than you'd expect.  Second thought: Tim Greene did a lot about the gender-wage gap that the union still complained about.  About your feelings about WMU as a whole: I think it's important for us as individuals perceiving society to acknowledge the difference between large organizations and the individual people inside of it. I like to think that people in a large organization are all trying their hardest to do what makes the most sense to them at the time. If their actions are ""wrong,"" it is usually because the person who set up the situation around that person (designed the role) didn't do the best job possible, because THAT person wasn't properly incentivized, whatever. Sometimes these issues are a corporation having a bad culture (and is a long term problem), and sometimes it is just one person making a small mistake.  For instance, when I saw that the goldsworth valley pond bridge was in terrible shape a few years ago, I called around to landscaping services and got it fixed. It wasn't anyone's specific problem that they made it look bad, it's that they just weren't responsible for it. A lot of people got riled up over East Campus, but none of those people cared until it was going to be taken away. They should have been active and tried to use it/use it for different things. They had to scrounge deep into history to defend the old buildings, and they couldn't argue that any student group or organization had any actual vested interest in the buildings besides for nostalgia purposes only.  Context for WMU's Actions: I know at WMU, they typically mimic what other universities do. They don't usually do anything original or new*. In the gender pay gap, they did the exact same thing that michigan state and UofM did. Other universities are moving more toward apartments just like WMU. When a head coach does well, universities give them a raise/bonus. These are all typical things. When they are thinking about repurposing land (East campus) they bring in architecture firms to do evaluations and make proposals/bids.  This union: For the union to complain about Greene who A: doesn't decide PJ's anything and B: did a good thing by fixing some gender inequity issues, makes me think that they don't understand how WMU works, or how the organization works.   The most annoying thing about this whole situation: That Mlive/the media/people on facebook/people on reddit care about this unions statement, that they care about a vote of ""no confidence"" (which means absolutely nothing to anyone) and that instead of trying to help fix issues, the union is fighting Tim Greene's right as a manager to fix a situation when someone does an annoyingly unproductive political move that was basically the CAS dean saying to his boss ""I'm going to do what you said not to do in order to show you that I am bigger and better than you.""  I mean, that unions aside. It's a high-level internal dispute between basically the VP of sales and a senior regional manager of sales. The union trying to get input isn't going to matter. The unions stake doesn't matter. What matters is the outcomes of the organization. The classes and opportunities for the students.  None of this will effect the students. Neither will east campus. Neither will the gender wage gap fine technicalities. Neither will losing a dean. Deans have such a small impact on the college, and really they rarely even have any contact with professors in that college.  *new things at wmu happen sometimes due to community/student movements, like the football helmets that detect concussions that WMU is great at, that was student-led and something to be proud of."
kzoo,2try3x,bbqturtle,-1,Tue Jan 27 18:04:11 2015 UTC,"I was on board until your comment about deans having no impact or contact with faculty. In my experience that simply is not true. I worked in the COE for 6 years and saw the dean(s) deal with the faculty directly and through department chairs.  As far as the spending on sports programs go. Do (non athlete) students pick WMU because of the sports teams? If not, then the revenue from those teams should wholely support that program, not money from the general fund.  As far as clerical wages, my wife is an office assistant at WMU and makes the same amount that I did as a student employee 8 years ago. She has a great benefits package which in my mind makes up the difference, but that may not be the same for others in her same position."
kzoo,2try3x,monkeyevil,3,Tue Jan 27 19:34:35 2015 UTC,"I agree that sports in general should be de-emphasized by universities in general, my point was just that those practices are common at other universities as well - and decided by the board, not by Tim Greene.   My experience with the CoE is that the hierarchy is much more flat- the dean has conversations with students and grad students and is involved on every level. Most other colleges aren't as flat and are much more buerocratic (sp) especially the CAS but also CFA, CHHS, HCoB and others."
kzoo,2try3x,bbqturtle,-1,Tue Jan 27 22:49:41 2015 UTC,I agree with you on sports programs 100%. An interesting read about that is http://www.amazon.com/Beer-Circus-Crippling-Undergraduate-Education/dp/0805068112
kzoo,2try3x,monkeyevil,4,Tue Jan 27 22:55:47 2015 UTC,"Respectfully, there are two sides to every story, and here's a differing perspective:  Tim Greene did not call for the gender pay-gap study. The union conducted one and Greene called for a second opinion. The second opinion, by the way, showed that the pay-gap was worse than what the union one estimated. I don't know what Greene said about a opposite pay-gap, but pointing out isolated cases is not helpful when two studies show a systemic problem. The adjustments that were eventually granted were not for ""many faculty;"" only a small number got them and many were very small (not the 3k-6k claimed above). The process for who was selected by Greene to receive these adjustments was never disclosed, so it is the lack of transparency that was attacked by the faculty. The average adjustment for men was higher than for women (albeit more women received adjustments). When asked whether this solved the gender pay gap, Green responded that he had ""not looked at the numbers."" A follow-up question asked whether he would. He said, ""no.""  Enyedi's actions are not out of line. The ""gifts"" that you refer to were salary adjustments to the severely underpaid staff in the college. The adjustments were approved by Greene. That's hardly stepping on his toes.  This IS the first vote of no confidence in Greene by the union. They did vote to censure him over the gender pay-gap. You may argue that the difference is semantical, but it is important. It's basically the difference between, ""we strongly disagree with what you've done"" and ""we cannot work with this person at all."" It is a vote that is purely symbolic, yes, but that is an exercise of free speech to send a clear message to the Board. Greene has the authority to fire Enyedi, and the faculty have the right to express their disapproval.  Enyedi has a 91% approval rating (and the turnout at the Board meeting last week is further evidence of it). Of course, being popular does not automatically mean that someone is a good leader. The said, he is popular for a reason. The faculty like the direction that he is taking the college. And they like that he stands up for them when necessary. I would very much like to hear an official reason for not renewing his contract, because I suspect that they will be hard-pressed to find one."
kzoo,2try3x,LinkKzoo,3,Tue Jan 27 22:05:16 2015 UTC,Thanks for the clarifications!! I only know about this issue from the article. I do consider a censure and a vote of no confidence the same thing.   I had no idea Greene approved the adjustments. I'm curious as to why is had been brought up as an issue.
kzoo,2try3x,bbqturtle,2,Tue Jan 27 22:45:10 2015 UTC,"I think it's very clear from what LinkKzoo is saying - it's an issue because those pay adjustments did not really decrease the gender pay gap - especially since the few male faculty members who received pay adjustments got thousands of dollars more than the female faculty. It's absolutely ludicrous.   Also, almost all of the information LinkKzoo posted has been in the local newspapers for quite some time. It's always good to thoroughly read an article before attacking it."

That's not just bad science, it's deliberately misrepresenting data for a political agenda. The Obama administration even came out about that, admitting that it was not an accurate assessment.   It's not a pay gap. It's an earning gap. It's already illegal to pay a woman less than a man for the same position. If businesses were doing this, there would be a long history of businesses being sued for the practice and it would inevitably become more expensive (after litigation) to pay a woman less to do the same job.   If businesses could just ""get away with it"" as a result of some convoluted corporate/gov't conspiracy, why would men be employed at all? If all you're concerned about is the bottom line, just hire women exclusively and save a ton on labor.   Except those things aren't happening. Because women aren't being paid less. Women are earning less, which is an important distinction.   The earning gap is a result of a number of factors.    Many more women stay at home than men. Men are socially prohibited from allowing their wives to earn for the family so they can stay at home, raise children, etc.  Men are statistically more likely to pursue high risk high reward type work. While some might bottom out and make very little money, those that are successful and make millions are able to cover the losses of those that fail.  Men are statistically more likely to ask for a raise. This is important, because if you're doing good work and seem content with your pay, why would a business just pay you more?   The percent of the earning gap is always changing. Some say 77%, others 86%, whatever. But the important thing to note is that the gap isn't coming from the top down (pay), it's coming from the bottom up (choices).   Why do men and women make different choices? It's a social issue. It would be great if men and women were statistically equal in the choices they make in life. But this is the real world and those choices can't be legally mandated.   In order to close the earning gap, you'd need to choose your favorite:    Force women to work who otherwise wouldn't. Force men not to work who otherwise would. Outright pay women more than men for the same job.    None of those are good solutions. If there are people making choices they are content with, so be it. Using bad statistics and social pressure to force redundant legislation (IT'S ALREADY ILLEGAL) is childish.   And for what it's worth, if we're so concerned about the imaginary glass ceiling, why aren't we upset about the very real glass floor? The proportion of men in low paying and dangerous jobs is absurdly high. Look at the statistics for workplace death and injury. It's literally over 90% male every single year."

Secretaries - 4 are female, 1 is male.   When you average the salary for males and the salary for females, you come to the conclusion that males just earn more than females. That's not the case. You need to evaluate people in the same position.   Is there a difference between the salary of the male secretary and a female secretary? That's the kind of honest information that needs to be provided, but the ""feminists"" don't want to talk about that."

Many years ago a crazy guy followed my gf's roommate into her house talking about how we had his friends tied up in the basement and that the house was filled with ghosts. Before the cops showed up he pulled a knife on me. They took him to jail that night and the next day released him to where he was staying... The knights inn.  One night I was at a party on axtell and a different crazy guy was throwing glass bottles at the house next door screaming at a girl that didn't know him.

I would much rather walk from Bells to the Radisson than Bells to Comfort Inn though. As far as the ""bar scene"" in Kalamazoo, most of the places are closer to the Radisson than the Comfort Inn. If money is an issue though, Comfort Inn may be worth the extra 1/2 mile or so walk."
kzoo,2s940h,AsLongAsYouKnow,1 point,Wed Jan 14 15:01:04 2015 UTC,"I would imagine OP is going to several bars, so starting at Rupert's (or ending there) as part of a hop to get a feel for the scene, comfort inn wouldnt be that far our of the way. Its less centralized but you just made it seem like it's agonizingly out of the way."
kzoo,2s940h,BrownL,2,Wed Jan 14 17:30:42 2015 UTC,"The Radisson is your best bet. Also check out this website, it has the location of all the brew pubs & breweries in the area  http://www.discoverkalamazoo.com/beer"
kzoo,2s940h,nnnnnnnnnnm,2,Tue Jan 13 17:53:35 2015 UTC,Thank you so much. This is great
kzoo,2s940h,nnnnnnnnnnm,2,Tue Jan 13 18:10:15 2015 UTC,"Definitely the Radisson is your best bet, OP.   For bars/breweries to check out:  Bell's. Arcadia. Beer Exchange. Shakespeare's. The Union. Olde Peninsula. Gonzo's. Green Top. Old Dog. Burdick's.   All are walking distance downtown.   Wake up the next day and check out Latitude 42  in Portage for lunch.   Enjoy Kalamazoo!"
kzoo,2s940h,nicogor,4,Wed Jan 14 01:23:17 2015 UTC,"If you are hop-heads, the local breweries in town are Bells, Arcadia, Gonzo’s, Tibbs, Ruperts, Old Peninsula and Boat Yard. If you are staying at the Radisson and wear some good winter clothes all of these breweries are within walking distance, Arcadia is the only one that would be a bit of a hike.  Bells has the best food out of all of them (in my opinion) so it might be a good place to start, and Old Peninsula has the most lackluster beer (again just my opinion).  Ruperts is near Up and Under’s (an Australian style Rugby bar), which has pretty good food that is served late. So that might be a good place to end your tour. Alternatively, Tibbs is right next to Dogs with Style, which is also good late night drunk food.  As for bars, my favorite bars within walking distance are:   Louie’s, a working-class dive bar with lots of taxidermied animals Old Dog, a cash only bar with a good atmosphere, has some bar games. Sometimes they charge cover, if they are charging cover its probably not worth it Shakespeare’s, a large bar with free popcorn, ample seating, bar games (pool, darts, shuffleboard), good food in the old Shakespeare Rod & Reel factory Kalamazoo Beer Exchange, and interesting bar with pretty good food (get the nachos) and a good range of different beers. The notable feature of this bar is that beer prices fluctuate, some say based on sales others say its arbitrary, so you can sometimes get a really nice beer for cheap especially when the “market crashes” Up and Under’s, previously described Australian style Rugby bar. Beer selection is a little more limited here but they have lots of bar games and the food is good and cheap. Harvey’s, decent food, decent beer selection. Nothing really that special right now, their deck is awesome but its too fucking cold for that. Center City Tap House, good food (pricier than most other bars on my list) and a good beer selection. This is a little more upscale and the clientele will be more adult and less college. London Grille, British Empire (Irish, Scotch, Indian) themed bar with an awesome selection of whiskey and imported beer. Food is really good, with unique menu items you won’t find elsewhere in Kalamazoo, like the Scotch Egg. Green Top Tavern, simple working-class style bar. Food is greasy fried goodness. Great for people watching.   Bars within walking distance to avoid (again just my opinion):   The Union, A decent bar for mixed drinks. I think its too pricey for what it is, and when there is live music it is intolerably loud. Burdicks, the bar/restaurant inside of the Radisson. Their beer selection is pretty good, but I think the food is nasty, service is usually poor and the prices are high. The Entertainment District (aka Monaco Bay, Wild Bull, Gatsby’s), one of the few bars in town that charges cover. The atmosphere really sucks, the whole place just seems fake and there is a shitty dance club and fake western bar. The only redeeming feature is the rooftop bar/lounge Skybar, which has overpriced drinks but an amazing view and even that is closed in the winter.   Breakfast the morning after:   STUDIO GRILL, this is my absolute favorite breakfast place in Kalamazoo, the food is awesome! Prices are not too high, they have good, locally roasted coffee. They make their own hot Serrano sauce, which is absolutely fantastic. Food Dance, upscale restaurant with awesome breakfast. This is probably the priciest breakfast in Kalamazoo, but they use a lot of really fresh local ingredients and their breakfast options are creative and tasty. Main Street Cafe, a decent cheap breakfast place. The cheapest of the three options I have listed.   Need coffee on the way out?   Black Owl Cafe, awesome local coffee roaster. Great atmosphere, amazing coffee. What more could you want? Best coffee in Kalamazoo according to me. Water Street Coffee, another great local coffee roaster with good snack options. A little pricier than Black Owl, but its also closer to the Radisson."

kzoo,2s940h,Macboogie,-3,Wed Jan 14 12:17:31 2015 UTC,I noticed you said brewery's Raddison is nice and there is a few brewery's within walking distance but in this weather everything but old Peninsula i'd drive to.   3-5 min drive from Raddison Gonzo's (try the vanilla porter it's outstanding) Bells (if you like micro's you already know what you like here) Old Peninsula (they got a coffee one I like overall my least fav spot) Arcadia (screw beer beef brisket and the mac n cheese is worth the trip)

kzoo,2s940h,tootNA,2,Tue Feb 3 08:13:00 2015 UTC,"This winter hasn't been too bad. The problem with driving from bar to bar downtown is that sometimes you have to park two blocks way. By the time you walk to your car, move it, and walk to the new bar, you could have been settled in with a drink already."

kzoo,2s82mt,linuxgeek20,4,Tue Jan 13 00:08:17 2015 UTC,"If you can part with having your own washer/dryer, I would recommend Pines West Apartments.   No bs like Davis Creek (formerly Devonshire). Lived at Devonshire for one year, wouldn't do it again. My apartment, and several others in my building, grew mold from crappy construction (water would leak into the drywall from the in-wall air conditioning unit).   You can have a carport if it is available. Rent starts out at $550/mo, can be a little higher or lower depending on the location of your apartment and what level it is on. Carport is $15 extra a month.  The manager Michelle is awesome, she's very nice and works with you if you have any problems. Maintenance usually gets there same-day, and there's no drama. Everybody is either a student, young professional, or people who just want a quiet place to live.  For the money, it is a very good place to live."
kzoo,2s82mt,Aleffewmo,3,Tue Jan 13 04:35:45 2015 UTC,"Can confirm. Lived here for almost 5 years, no issues. Maintenance is always quick and does a great job. I know the previous property owners did a terrible job--we've had roof issues and plumbing issues due to prior ownership, but things were fixed immediately. Had issues with the AC, they looked at it that day, and we ended up with a new thermostat and new furnace because ours was apparently dead (3rd floor, we never used it). They allow 2 cats per apartment with NO FEES and no requirement to declaw (I believe they actually prefer that you don't declaw).  Very quiet, no crime, no problems with our neighbors at all."
kzoo,2s82mt,eratoast,2,Tue Jan 13 17:10:28 2015 UTC,"I can't recommend Pines West enough. Lived  there for 4 years, no complaints.  It's close enough to 131 to get wherever you need quickly but secluded and quiet at the same time."
kzoo,2s82mt,IndigoHero,1 point,Tue Jan 13 17:52:25 2015 UTC,"Yup, been here 2 1/2 years and love it. They fix any issues same day, usually within minutes of reporting.

All of them are quality places.  I've lived at Dover Hills.  Their grounds are the best of the bunch (IMO) but the floorplans are bland.  Top notch people working there, at least in my experience. Summer Ridge and Drakes Pond are both a bit older but have been updated."

Only about 2 miles from campus, but definitely a quiet apt complex. Mostly one bedrooms with rent at $535 a month. The buildings are a little older, but everything is on the ground floor so no one above you (there is actually a small amount of attic space) and no shared hallways. The apartments have laundry hook ups, but unfortunately no garages. Dogs and cats allowed. Honestly I've lived here since July and couldn't be happier with the place. Very friendly and accommodating management as well."

It's worth the 20 minute drive."
kzoo,2ryxht,cbsteven,6,Sat Jan 10 16:00:26 2015 UTC,Hunans ftw!  Chinn chinn is good but there is always a huge wait and it is pricier. Hunan is relatively cheap and amazing. They also deliver.

kzoo,2ryxht,broncoshopper,0,Sun Jan 11 04:50:39 2015 UTC,"Except Ziingo is a totally different menu/concept than Chinn Chinn. So it's not ""Like Chinn Chinn but faster"". Just a different restaurant from the same owners."

As for Campus Wok....I've heard they don't treat their employees to well and have bad food quality standards. Sucks because I used to go there all the time because of their cheap prices and proximity to Rood Hall (where my grad classes are at).
kzoo,2ryxht,Karradine,2,Tue Jan 13 02:53:53 2015 UTC,"Chinn Chinn is OK, it is middlebrow Chinese restaurant stuff, similar to PF Chang's.  The Hunan Gardens traditional menu is pretty good, can be kinda heavyhanded with the soy & cornstarch, at least to my taste.  Wei Wei in Grand Rapids is the real deal for actual Chinese food, especially if you like seafood."
kzoo,2ryxht,dutchie727,2,Sat Jan 10 17:57:47 2015 UTC,"Oh man,  I have to disagree on the Chinn Chinn thing. That's the best food I've had in a LONG time. Totally worth the drive out to Mattawan."

Not terrible in itself, but definitely a disappointment if you've asked for Chinese. I never made it to Wei Wei, but I'm glad you were there to warn against CC."
kzoo,2ryxht,ICanTrimYourArmor,0,Tue Feb 17 04:43:06 2015 UTC,China Kitchen is the most accurate portion-for-price. Thai Cuisine has the best phad thai and curry. Hunan is the best in general. I think Chinn Chinn is a little over hyped.

My thoughts were: - for people in wrecked vehicles, or in the ditch, look behind you and if there's no car coming, get out and get far enough away from the road to not be in danger.   for the guy videoing (presumably was driving in the opposite direction), get in your car and drive up a quarter of a mile and then get out and start flagging cars down so they either stop, or slow down - even just getting their attention would probably help them be prepared for something. have someone else grab flares from the semis and start them up - get in another car in the other direction and start waving them out the window to get people's attention.   Those are just my thoughts. Is there someone here that has real knowledge about how to stop the chain reaction?"

kzoo,2rwzlu,84awkm,2,Sun Jan 11 16:46:01 2015 UTC,"My wife and I just got back home to Chicago area last night after having to spend the weekend in the area. Took 48 hours just to find out where the rental car she had been driving had been towed to. In the end it was in Battle Creek. I took a bus out on Saturday to meet up with her as she was on her own with nothing beyond a small purse and the clothes she had on. Couple of days of hotels and taxis cost a small fortune but never mind. Better than being injured or worse. Didn't even need the car. That's in the hands of the rental company and insurance to worry about now...just the belongings from inside it which she had to leave behind at the time of the accident. We took a bus back last night and again the weather was poor. Bus driver was a pro but some of the idiots on i-94 that we observed...complete madness. My wife was actually in tears on the bus because she could see fools out the window tailgating and weaving in and out of lanes while you couldn't even see the road markings due to the snow. Guys in semis and 4x4 towing mini-trailers easily doing 60 in a snow storm. I'd have laughed at them if I didn't know better. They'll get their just deserts one day if they carry on driving like that. We passed several accidents and people in the ditch.  There was a wide variety of cars in the lot we ended up at. Some, like the one my wife was in, appeared to be driveable. Hers had damage on all four sides from impacts and a rip/hole in one of the doors but all the windows were intact and all 4 tires were fine etc. It did have some burn damage presumably from ash/smoke as she was a few rows ahead of the trucks that caught fire going east. Other cars were genuinely in bits. One was basically split in half right up the middle. Opened up like a can of beans and still full of the belongings of the people inside. It had to have been hit at high speed by something like an SUV or truck. Apparently the people walked away from it too but if you'd not been told that in advance you'd have wondered how anyone survived it. A testament to modern car design these days. You can essentially have a car disintegrate around you but be unhurt yourself. I would have taken a picture but it felt wrong to be a voyeur of sorts."

kzoo,2rv83n,hphedwig,2,Fri Jan 9 19:41:44 2015 UTC,There was another semi with hazardous chemicals in it that was on fire.
kzoo,2rv83n,GoofTroop_PoopChute,13,Fri Jan 9 18:04:37 2015 UTC,"I drove this stretch at around 7:30 this morning. Visibility was so poor that half the time I couldn't see the road and was absolutely just following the vague tail lights from the car ahead of me. Cars and semis passed me regularly, which kicked up snow and decreased visibility more.   I was in the slower group of cars and actually felt like I was still driving way too fast for conditions.. But I knew slowing down further would create even more of a hazard. I also felt like a pansy who can't handle a little ice and somehow felt pressured to live up to the speed expectations of the other drivers.   Early this morning everyone at work was bitching about people driving too slow on 94. I love it here but think Michigan needs to stop it with the whole snow overconfidence thing. Most of the cars that I've seen in ditches over the past few days have been SUVs and pickup trucks."
kzoo,2rv83n,Quiescencies,6,Fri Jan 9 19:00:29 2015 UTC,"I'm right there with you! I am a slow driver when the roads are in this condition, and I always have that nagging feeling that I need to speed up to get with the flow of traffic, but I never do, because I don't feel safe at the speed they are going. And usually, that's a good thing, because normally when that happens, the people flying by everyone else are seen in the ditch or median a few miles down the road.  It's been said a million times over, but people need to respect the conditions of the road and if the majority are going slower than the posted limit... take it as a hint that maybe you should too.  I still haven't heard/read about what initially caused this particular pile up, but it wouldn't surprise me one bit if it was someone in a hurry. My brother takes that route to work around 7:30-8am and he said aside from having to go slower due to whiteout conditions, he didn't have a problem... so it just makes you wonder."
kzoo,2rv83n,hphedwig,1 point,Fri Jan 9 19:49:13 2015 UTC,The road really wasn't very icy at all. I had no serious issues braking and there was very little accumulation due to the wind. Rapidly changing visibility was really the only major issue
kzoo,2rv83n,Quiescencies,3,Fri Jan 9 20:11:56 2015 UTC,"I think it had iced over by the time of the accident. The temp rose this morning, all of the previously applied road salt kicked up a notch and then the winds and snow picked up again, icing it over.   That stretch is horrible every day of the year.  :( let's face it- no one likes driving 94, ever."

kzoo,2rv83n,84awkm,3,Fri Jan 9 16:19:21 2015 UTC,No idea I'm afraid. I'm sitting in Illinois. My wife said two transport trucks were on fire so maybe one of them had something inside. She said she's on a bus now and they're moving people to a truck stop off the highway as it's obviously too cold to be standing around.
kzoo,2rv83n,84awkm,2,Fri Jan 9 16:23:47 2015 UTC,A lot of people involved have been moved to a school in Galesburg according to my wife. They're kinda in limbo at the moment because the road is still closed and the fires seem pretty bad. Said that they've been given food and drink and are comfortable enough. Seems like the emergency services and charities are doing a great job out there today.

kzoo,2rv83n,OnlyIknow9,3,Fri Jan 9 18:25:45 2015 UTC,"Look at how fast those trucks were going! Its insane! How could they possibly think they were traveling at a safe speed for the conditions?   A fully loaded semi truck has the gross vehicle weight, depending on its cargo, of up to 80,000 pounds. (Compare this to an average car's weight of 4,000 pounds.) At a speed of 55 m.p.h., a semi truck's stopping distance is 100 yards--the length of a football field. A mid-size automobile traveling at the same speed can stop within half of that distance.  Yet, semi trucks are always the ones passing other vehicles in less than ideal conditions..."
kzoo,2rv83n,BurningCircus,1 point,Fri Jan 9 23:25:43 2015 UTC,"What I've heard (I'm not sure on the reliability of my source, but it is a possible explanation) is that once they get up to speed in these conditions it is actually not safe to brake because the brakes can easily cause locked wheels and loss of traction, especially with a 53' trailer. On hills they build up speed and don't have a safe way to slow down."
kzoo,2rv83n,Timecook,2,Sat Jan 10 02:17:38 2015 UTC,That's accurate (I drive one). What likely happened here was a sudden whiteout. So those guys were up to speed and then quickly slowing down caused a domino effect. There's no safe way to drive in that weather.
kzoo,2rv83n,dirtytom,1 point,Sat Jan 10 20:48:49 2015 UTC,"this is a quote from facebook   ""Im a trucker and if guys would stop acting like children on the CB, more truck drivers would use a CB and I bet this accident would have been cut in half by letting guys know what was happening""  any thoughts on this? i had a cb in my car a while back. never got to use it in a situation like this though."
kzoo,2rv83n,Timecook,2,Sat Jan 10 21:56:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah if more CB's were in use I'm sure that many trucks wouldn't have been involved.  I don't have one but I share my truck with other guys and I don't want to install one and then have someone else mess with it.  But yeah the behavior on there is pretty terrible.  When I drove over the road I had one, and all the old lore of CB handles and a trucker brotherhood is mostly dead... there are some guys who use it the way it's intended but for every one of them theres another blaring hate speech or making stupid jokes or whatever.  The worst of them purposely give bad advice to other drivers.  They take advantage of the veil of anonymity.  Wouldn't have helped the cars though."
kzoo,2rv83n,dirtytom,1 point,Sat Jan 10 22:06:54 2015 UTC,"isn't this what a transmission is for? even if it isn't a manual you can still allow the tranny to downshift. the ""jake brake"" as it were...engine braking."
kzoo,2rv83n,Timecook,2,Sat Jan 10 04:14:56 2015 UTC,Downshifting in this weather isn't always a good idea. It sends sudden high revs to the drive wheels which can break loose. In a truck that jake break just sends even more revs to the wheels than a normal downshift. A jake needs traction to work.
kzoo,2rv83n,dirtytom,1 point,Sat Jan 10 19:18:27 2015 UTC,"indeed, was just replying to the fact that it seemed transmission wasn't even mentioned as a way to slow down, just the pedal actuated brakes. downshifting can't save you from driving too fast."

Really, /u/thatoneguy54 has the completely correct answer 100%.  In fact, I encourage you to drive down kendall and stop at every apartment complex."
kzoo,2rr2im,bbqturtle,2,Thu Jan 8 20:31:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Though I am kind of confused because out of all the places on Kendall, I could only find two of them on apartmentratings.com and they both got terrible reviews. I want to say Whitehall and Kendall Manor"
kzoo,2rr2im,bbqturtle,2,Thu Jan 8 20:39:23 2015 UTC,"well, I lived at mansard house apartments on kendall and they were fantastic.  FWIW, apartmentratings.com is a terrible site and extorts apartments just like yelp does. Unfortunately there isn't a very viable alternative. I think Padmapper or something might work better, but really, unfortunately, real estate is still in the dark ages and actually walking in the front door is the only way to contact a lot of them."

kzoo,2rr2im,thatoneguy54,2,Thu Jan 8 20:54:48 2015 UTC,"Look at any of the apartments on Kendall Avenue. North Campus Village, Santos Hill, Kendall Ridge North, and Kendall Ridge South are all owned by this company. Most of them are townhomes that can hold anywhere from 3-5 people. Prices usually range from $300-$400 depending on the complex.  I lived in Santos Hill for two years, and it was perfect. It's a 10 minute drive to campus (because of the one ways), a 20 minute walk, and there's a bus line that goes directly to the campus loading zone. My rent was $300/month, but I think they raised it since I moved out to $325.   Either way, the complexes are filled with 20 somethings, largely students, but it's not obnoxiously party-central like apartments off West Michigan or Campus Habitat are.   There's also Whitehall, Graduate Gardens (really hard to get into), Kendall Manor, and Hillside Village (my current building) that I think all have 2 bedroom apartments, so if you wanted to split up that's an option. I know less about those places (except Hillside, which is a very decent building) but the Kzoo prop people are pretty good.  I highly recommend any of the complexes on Kendall."
kzoo,2rr2im,diyorgasms,1 point,Thu Jan 8 17:20:02 2015 UTC,"Any complex is going to be shitty. You should really look at splitting a house in the Vine neighborhood. Well within your price range, lots of approximately college aged people around, good amenities in walking distance."

It's very close to campus and very college student oriented. I know they have a pool, not sure about a fitness center. If you're looking to spend $375 on rent that's definitely a decent option, if you're looking for $375 rent, electricity, heat, tv, internet it might not be as great."

kzoo,2rbezw,sonaaon,2,Sun Jan 4 18:10:53 2015 UTC,Food Dance. It's way cheaper to go there during breakfast/brunch/lunch than dinner time.
kzoo,2rbezw,fuktardy,2,Sun Jan 4 18:56:56 2015 UTC,"Not exactly a buffet like bravo, but cosmos is fantastic if you've got the time. It's spotty, though - It's taken 2.5 hours to get in and out of that place. Worth it in my opinion. I think it's a revolving door in terms of staff, so the service is what is spotty. Knowing that, I still consider it one of my favorites.  Crows nest is really great, too."
kzoo,2rbezw,czech_it,2,Sun Jan 4 19:01:41 2015 UTC,"I've heard East Egg is always good. I personally love LaRue's for brunch, but they are much more laid back than Bravo, and only take cash."
kzoo,2rbezw,Macboogie,2,Mon Jan 5 19:27:53 2015 UTC,East Egg is really basic stuff nothing special I eat there when it's close but I honestly wouldn't go out of my way for it it's just regular breakfast food you can get anywhere.
kzoo,2rbezw,Macboogie,2,Fri Jan 9 08:36:42 2015 UTC,Crows Nest is absolutely awesome I can't promote it enough. It's not classy but we are talking organic goodness. Their amaretto pecan french toast is worth driving across town for in fact I and may people I know do for that dish and countless others.
kzoo,2rbezw,Sull_Money,2,Fri Jan 9 08:38:08 2015 UTC,"Cosmos: Pretty good savory breakfast, crummy waffles (one man's opinion), decent bloody mary.  Studio Grille: Awesome greasy spoon brunch, great house made hot sauce, great prices. No booze :(  Food Dance: Great food, GREAT bloody mary.  High prices (compared to the above).  Blue Dolphin: Cheap, greasy and delicious food.  Booze! Burning cheese!"

It's a buffet of all different kinds of breakfast food as well as more savory lunch/dinner dishes. They also have wood-fire pizzas, an omelette station, and an awesome dessert buffet.

Kalamazoo is holding its NYE festival and you can still purchase buttons to enter! Buttons can be bought at hardings market in kalamazoo, portage, and oshtemo townships for 5$! They also sell them at Bronson park downtown for $10 but limited quantities. Give them a call to see if they still have some, it was fun when I went a few years ago.  :)  My roomates are also going to bells brewery downtown for live entertainment and a couple beers to ring in the new year! It's only 5$ to go see the bands and the drinks always seem fairly priced to me, but make sure you get tickets fast or they may sell out...you can buy then online!"
kzoo,2qx5p2,broncoshopper,2,Wed Dec 31 19:07:48 2014 UTC,Could you tell me about the buttons? What is it and is it like fireworks etc at Bronson park?
kzoo,2qx5p2,nutw07,1 point,Wed Dec 31 19:24:03 2014 UTC,A lot of the churches and organizations surrounding bronson park open their doors to the public and host mini family friendly 1/2 hour shows. I always liked the opportunity to get a good look at the inside of the beautiful churches in downtown. Bronson park serves as a central hub where everyone congregates to watch the fireworks (it's fun from the top of the parking structures too). Their website (www.newyearsfest.com) has a list of performances for reference. Have a happy new years!
kzoo,2qx5p2,broncoshopper,1 point,Wed Dec 31 20:11:17 2014 UTC,Sorry for the late reply! But the buttons are pretty much tickets. There was fireworks and food venders when I went a few years ago. There will probably be a lot of personal fireworks this year since they have been legal to have in michigan for a couple years now :p

kzoo,2qullw,MasterFrills,7,Tue Dec 30 20:53:03 2014 UTC,"Holy shit, the downvotes are pouring into the comments defending basic human rights! How can somebody disagree with the idea that cops shouldn't be able to decide whether somebody lives or dies? That's why the whole fucking court system exists. That's why every police officer is trained to take down threats with non lethal solutions.   Less blood on cops hands would be great. Protect and serve, not terrorize and control."
kzoo,2qullw,Knif3,-1,Wed Dec 31 01:14:11 2014 UTC,"""Less blood on cops hands would be great. Protect and serve, not terrorize and control.""  I like this a lot.  ""That's why every police officer is trained to take down threats with non lethal solutions.""  They are also trained to take down threats with lethal solutions for situations that their own lives are in danger. If you're trying to tell me that you'd rather see a police officer get shot instead of a drug dealer (think meth or cocaine not marijuana) or child rapist or a murderer, then I think you need to have a little chat with yourself.  ""How can somebody disagree with the idea that cops shouldn't be able to decide whether somebody lives or dies?""  The answer to your question is that most every cop is trained to do exactly that. Given the fact that the situation is nearly always ""lives,"" there are some situations where they have to decide ""dies.""  Now this is not to say that I don't think there are some whack job cops out there who shouldn't be in the police force and deciding life or death situations. There certainly are some and I wish there were something I could do about it."
kzoo,2qullw,Gravitational_Bong,2,Wed Dec 31 03:01:09 2014 UTC,"think meth or cocaine   How are these different from marijuana dealers?   Now this is not to say that I don't think there are some whack job cops out there who shouldn't be in the police force and deciding life or death situations.   So you pretty much agree with the protest, then?   I wish there were something I could do about it.   The irony is ironic."
kzoo,2qullw,Gravitational_Bong,0,Wed Dec 31 04:46:42 2014 UTC,I've never once met a marijuana dealer who packs heat.   No. The protest is to stop cops from killing people at all. Not to thwart whack jobs.  I sincerely do wish I could do something.
kzoo,2qullw,FakingItEveryDay,2,Wed Dec 31 04:54:11 2014 UTC,"Virtually any major marijuana dealer does (source: I am a producer). Wouldn't you protect yourself if you knew the cops and courts won't?  The event is to directly protest the lack of indictment in the two recent killings. People aren't saying ""cops shouldn't be able to kill,"" they're saying ""cops should be held responsible by being put on trial when there are questionable circumstances."""
kzoo,2qullw,callmegecko,0,Wed Dec 31 04:59:45 2014 UTC,"If I produced any kind of drug I would have a weapon purely because of the value the product holds and the people I would deal with.  I don't really look at the protest the same way as you, but your way certainly makes it more understandable.  I think the unfortunate thing is that cops are put on trial but tend to get away with it in many circumstances."
kzoo,2qullw,spice_taster,7,Wed Dec 31 07:23:45 2014 UTC,"They are not to protect us ""As they see fit"" that's the SS you're thinking of. They should be there to protect us as we see fit, if they can just do anything they want, then they're a bigger danger than what they're trying to protect us from.  Nobody deserves to be choked to death for selling cigarettes. Kids don't deserve to be shot with no warning for playing the park with a toy gun. These are the actions of cowards and sociopaths. Police are not more important than the citizens they're supposed to be serving. Their lives don't matter more to the point where they are excused in killing a citizen for the least irrational fear that gives the goosebumps."
kzoo,2qullw,zombiechris,1 point,Tue Dec 30 21:20:58 2014 UTC,"I really have to disagree with you. If police officers protected us as ""we see fit,"" then they would be standing around as each and every person bitched about how they thought they should have gone about serving their duty. Policemen undergo extensive training to be able to asses a situation and execute measures as they see fit. They simply cannot comply with how each and every citizen feels about the way they go about their business. They can only meet a certain standard of which each officer is subjected to.  I'd like you to think about if each and every person told a nuclear engineer working at a power plant how to do their job. There would probably be a meltdown. Physically and mentally. Instead we rely on their previous education and experience to guide them through their work as they see fit.  As for each of the situations you mentioned I think there are some concerns to be raised as to who we have working as cops. There are some fantastic human beings who work in law enforcement. But just as in all professions there are some cases of a ""bad cookie."" In the case of being a police officer, I don't think there is any room for a ""bad cookie,"" because it isn't numbers and blue prints at stake, it's civilian lives."

kzoo,2qullw,Gravitational_Bong,1 point,Wed Dec 31 03:05:18 2014 UTC,"It seems law enforcement has lost a lot of respect. There's many good cops that sit by and watch their fellow officers shooting dogs, kids, black people selling cigarettes, etc. They stand by and hide behind a thin blue line of silence and allow people they know good and well should not hold a position of power, but they sit by because that's a ""brother in blue"" those officers are the worst because the ones doing the killing are just the assholes you've known your whole life, but the silent ones are good people that do nothing."

She is usually booked out several months in advance, so if you need it now, this might not be the place, but you sound like someone who wants it done well, not just soon. I am of The opinion that one does well by themselves in thinking about a tattoo for a good long time before they get it."

I won't let anyone else touch a needle to my skin.  She can take a vague idea and turn it into the masterpiece you didn't know it could be.  Plus her colors stay bright for many many years and her lines don't bleed out as the tattoo ages."

The only reason I responded the way I did was this is a thing I hear from time to time and I think it is the wrong way of looking at it. Raven is highly skilled and widely regarded as a great artist, but she works alone with Zero support staff. Because of the demand, she is booked months in advance and many people feel that this means she is hard to get in to see. She's not, it just takes some time, which again, I feel should not be a problem when talking about largely permanent alterations to ones skin.

Dealing with assholes is part of the job in my opinion.  Permanent bans are... permanent.

It's kinda irritating because they're so obsessed with being ""not a gym"" that they have zero squat racks or bars for proper deadlifts. You have to do them in the Smith machine which limits motion and increases risk of injury if you're going heavy. Also, they seem to be terrified of providing sufficient 45lb and 25lb weights.   But the price is good and they always have open treadmills even during busy winter hours. It's a grab-bag I guess."

kzoo,2oln78,UberAndrewMI,4,Mon Dec 8 01:13:50 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure this will be of direct help, but I hope it at least gives you a bit of perspective that you can apply here.  I just moved to the area from San Francisco. I watched Uber (and Lyft, etc.) get started - and it seems like your first two questions are out of sync with how we've used the services (in SF).  Instead of being a consistent pickup service on consistent days - Uber is a ""I need a car now!"" service no matter where you are.   I've seen it used extensively as an alternative to drinking and driving when a dinner with friends turns into a night out drinking.  It's also wonderful for when you want to go to a neighborhood that is either expensive/difficult to park in, or just not safe to leave your car.  I've used it, more than once, to have someone else deal with rush hour traffic when I had to get through it to a place I didn't normally visit.  ...and yes, I've known a few coworkers who've used it as their ride to and from work each day - but that was rare.   It's more of an 'in the moment' sort of thing than it is a 'do this every day' solution.  If you are trying to sort out when to work and where to focus, I'd suggest bar zones and drinking hours (get them there, take a break, get them home).   Airport runs are also another brilliant use, but I don't know if that applies in Detroit.  Rush hour, I don't know enough to know if that applies here. Games though, with those beautiful stadiums, another great time to be ready to get people home after they watch the game and get tipsy.  How to make it a great experience?    Keep your car super clean on the inside. Make me jealous of how much of a slob I am (this will let me sit and relax instead of wondering what I'm sitting on/in). If you use an air freshener, keep it mild, but that's good. Have mints and small bottles of water to offer. I didn't expect it, but when drivers did it, it was really nice. Free - so maybe don't do this unless you are driving a premium Uber car and getting better rates. Don't run at a loss, you need to be paid! Have your radio on to one of the local pop stations, or pop from your mobile. Save the music you love for when you are driving off duty. Ask people if they want to hear something specific, but save the Slayer for when you are on your own :)  Ask me how I want to get there. Fastest route? Fewer turns? Scenic? Area alleys and backstreets ok? Etc. This way you know when you should put the hammer down and burn up the roads, when you should stick to well lit roads, and when you can run the maze to cut around things.  Ask me when I expect to be done and if I'll be looking for an Uber on the way out. That way, if you have nothing going on, you can get an idea where most of your riders think they will want a new ride, and when. Increase your odds of being there for the pickup without cheating the system. Your phone. Don't talk on it while I'm in your car. It's really weird to hear half of your personal conversation; and only moreso if you are speaking in anything but English. While I'm your passenger, your concern is making me feel like I am the only thing that you are focused on. Taking a phone call, texting, anything that isn't interacting with your driver app... it's just not polite or good. ...and lastly. Smile. Say ""Hi!"" and ""Thanks!"" with great energy like we are friends. For our time together, we are. The drivers who are silent are creepy. Make me feel guilty for giving such a nice person anything other than a five star review. I always do my best to be a postive and friendly rider for this same reason. You are being cool and solving a need that I have at a good price. I want you to know I'm happy and thankful, let me know the same in kind :)    Best of luck, and thanks in advance. I hope to find you out there when I need a ride :D  Edit: I failed formatting.  Thankfully this wasn't the final."
kzoo,2oln78,Golden_Wolverine,3,Mon Dec 8 03:48:06 2014 UTC,"Thanks a lot. After roughly 20 trips I'm still maintaining a 5 star rating, even without mints/water available.  My full time job is in customer service, so I feel that helps me a lot in the conversational department.   I need to experiment with morning hours; Uber is telling me it gets busy between 8-10 Monday through Friday.   Just so you know, if you see a car in the western Portage area, there's a good chance it is me. :)"

kzoo,2oln78,jage9,3,Wed Dec 24 04:20:04 2014 UTC,"Hey Andrew, I've used Uber extensively in Kalamazoo since it launched this summer as well as in many other cities. I'm glad to see the availability of drivers increasing in the last month or two, though it's still mostly available in the evenings and weekends here. Most of my rides are to and from downtown, with the occasional airport pickup. I'm sure it's a bit of a challenge here and in other smaller cities where the public transit culture is lacking. So people aren't used to checking the app for rides, especially during the day. Right now, it's a bit of a cat and mouse game and more probably needs to be done to promote here which will in turn keep drivers busier. Most hotels in Kzoo don't have cabs on-site, so getting hotel front desk people to recommend Uber would be one idea. I've had good experiences with basically every driver here which is great. Bottled water is a nice luxury, but not expected. I've needed an emergency cell phone charger a time or two and love it when drivers have one available. GW makes several good points here as well."
kzoo,2oln78,slightlyintoxicated1,1 point,Mon Dec 8 07:13:14 2014 UTC,"I've only driven this past weekend, I had about 20 trips altogether during bar hours. I did well in terms of rating (maintaining a 5 star currently).  I am going to be experimenting with morning hours to see if it is busy or not, but I'm feeling because Kalamazoo isn't exactly NYC or a bigger California city, it may only be busy during bar hours.  I'm surely giving out my promo card to people who get in with the pax that aren't on the app, hopefully it will make a difference.  If you get a rider named Andrew, mention reddit and you may just find me!"

Otherwise, I am pretty sure that the studio apartments at Concord are right around that amount.  Heat is included so your only utility would be electric.  You get free antenna channels through their cable system.  I know it's got a not so great rep but I just signed my fifth lease there and I've never had any problems.  I live in a one bedroom and the rent started out at $440 but over the years has gone up to $470.  Like I said, though, I""m fairly certain the studio apartments here are still under $400/month"
kzoo,2nis73,smegma_legs,1 point,Thu Nov 27 02:46:03 2014 UTC,That budget is for a room/roomate situation. If I were to live on my own that would obviously cost more. I am making enough money but just trying not to live outside or to the very edge of my means.

Charter Internet modem is required & included in price; other equipment, install, taxes, fees & surcharges may apply.    https://www.charter.com/buyflow/content/products-offers-disclaimers  So after a year:  AT&T $50 for 45Mbps Charter $55 for 60 Mbps"

They offered me 18mbps for $47 and 24 mbps for $55. When I said no, they offered 45 mbps for $55. They justified the pricing by stating that it costs more to maintain fiber technology, so I was paying for a quality connection.  I am getting the 60 mbps deal for $39.99 with charter, no contract, guaranteed pricing for a year. No fees to cancel service."

kzoo,2neih9,lsp1018,1 point,Tue Nov 25 23:27:24 2014 UTC,We were actually thinking of switching from Charter to AT&T because of how unreliable the connection is. I would say it drops at least 2 times a week. It's also very touchy depending on the weather. We've learned to get our cell phones out and turn on the data to browse the internet every time a storm comes. But it seems like maybe it's the lesser of two evils in reading these comments...

Uverse requires buying a $200 device from them, though you'll get a $200 gift card in return.    If I remember correctly, AT&T has caps on their data and will charge you extra for breaking them."

kzoo,2neih9,BrandonCarlson,1 point,Wed Nov 26 19:20:42 2014 UTC,Charter is spotty based on where you are in town. In my experience it was nearly flawless in the Stuart/Westnedge Hill/Drake Road Neighborhoods but I've had frequent outages in the Vine and Milwood neighborhoods. Vine may have issues because it's such a densely populated area and AT&T isn't available so everyone has Charter but I don't know.
kzoo,2neih9,djhomebody,1 point,Wed Nov 26 21:37:52 2014 UTC,"Charter for sure. Great speed for the price that AT&T can't compete with, somewhat ethical company (at least better than the other choices in the area) and decent service. Whenever I have an extended (more than 30 minutes) outage, I call and get credit toward my bill. They've made major improvement to their customer service departments in the past several years."

You obviously don't know how the police department works.  They selectively choose which charges to pursue. The only thing the police fear is the media.

Shawarma House/Shawarma King is really good and pretty cheap, but Shawarma King is better IMO.

kzoo,2mshkt,laconix23,5,Wed Nov 19 18:27:38 2014 UTC,"I worked for them for a summer. They pay employees in cash under the table, pay the cooks less than minimum wage, and health and safety standards in the kitchen are marginal at best. No one gets any training on foodbourne illness or safe storage and handling. Food is left in open buckets and trays on the floor of the kitchen. Just a very sketchy place once you've seen what goes on behind the scenes. I have a few pictures if people are interested."

kzoo,2mshkt,laconix23,3,Wed Nov 19 22:08:40 2014 UTC,There are a few dishes I'd eat. Let me get out of classes and stuff and I'll dig out their menu.
kzoo,2mshkt,nnnnnnnnnnm,1 point,Wed Nov 19 22:13:55 2014 UTC,"Anything with the heavily-breaded chicken (General Tso's, orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken, etc) I'd avoid. See my other comment for details.  The chicken with broccoli is pretty good, as is the fried rice. Also, the chow mei fun on their specialty noodles menu is awesome.   The quality of the food probably isn't any worse than any other family-run Chinese place. I might just be biased because I saw what went on in the kitchen."
kzoo,2mshkt,peasantrebellion,0,Thu Nov 20 00:49:38 2014 UTC,Definitely interested. It'll probably scare me out of spending so much money there.
kzoo,2mshkt,SteveOnAPlane,7,Wed Nov 19 21:36:06 2014 UTC,"There's a lot of little things I noticed there, but here's a few of the things that bothered me the most. I was a delivery driver btw; I didn't cook any food, but I spent a lot of time between deliveries in the kitchen with the cooks.  For most of their chicken dishes, they use these really heavily-breaded bits of chicken. There's more batter than meat, and part of how they're made is by mixing them with batter in a 5-gallon bucket. When the cooks do this, they don't use utensils or gloves; they just stick their bare arm into the batter/raw chicken mixture up to the elbow and swirl it around.  After the pieces of raw chicken are breaded, they're lightly fried, then placed in a plastic bin for later use. This is so they can cook the chicken faster when orders come in. The thing is, these bins of chicken are just left out in the open in the kitchen. Usually on metal racks, but there were multiple times when I nearly tripped over a bin of chicken sitting on the floor. They weren't refrigerated and weren't covered.  I've seen cooks drop pieces of meat on the floor while chopping it up; they just pick it up and throw it right back in the pile.  As far as business practices go, the owners are reeeeeally sketchy. They pay the cashiers in personal checks, NOT paychecks. They pay the drivers completely in cash. They justified this by saying their employees were ""independent contractors"" tax-wise, so we had to file our own taxes, and pay something like 7% extra in taxes out of our own pockets. How they pay the cooks is even worse: most of the cooks are immigrants, and either can't afford or aren't able to rent their own place in town. So they live at the owners' house. Since the owners figure that they're providing room and board for these guys, they pay them less than minimum wage, in cash. There's between 6 or 8 of these cooks living at the owners' house at any one time (they come and go over time) and they all live in their basement. I've seen their house; it's a medium-ish sized one-story house. The basement can't be that big. At one point while I was working there, the house got infested with bed bugs. So the owner, being too cheap to hire an exterminator, bought one of those little DIY bug bomb things and fumigated the house himself. While this was going on, the guys who lived there would come into work with little red bites ALL over their arms and necks. It was awful.  The kicker is, even though they pay the workers shit wages and live in a dilapidated house, the owners' make a TON of money. They have two brand new cars, one of which is an Audi. The husband wears a gold chain and always has a brand new phone; the wife has a couple different Coach purses and wears designer clothes. They also have enough money to take week-long vacations across the country every year. This summer they went to New York City for a week.  I guess the food is of no worse quality than any other family-run Chinese place. I've personally never gotten sick from eating it, over two and a half years at WMU. But as far as business ethics and just the type of people they are, it's a really sketchy place.  Edit: Added pictures - http://imgur.com/a/7nrKs"

They don't deserve to be treated like this, especially if they came to the US to live a decent life but get treated like shit here.  I've been eating there for a year now.

Then we have tipped above that, but... I do get irritated, especially when the driver doesn't give me my bill because they don't want me to see that I am already being charged a delivery fee.    Do the delivery drivers get the fee or does that go to the restaurant?  Honestly, before I knew about the fee I have over-tipped big time if the driver gets to keep the fee.

In the rare case, some delivery places who charge a fee will give a portion or all of it to the driver. I work for a mom and pops place delivering their food and all of the $3 delivery fee goes in my pocket but at Pizza hut at my other job I get the minimum allowed $1.05 per delivery which I assume comes out of the $3 fee charged."

But, it might be view more like an  “outdoor late fall beer festival” the event is a Friday happy hour of celebrating all things Kalamazoo, including anything made in Kalamazoo County.  Merchandise, beverages, art, you name it; this is a time to come an literally shop Kalamazoo. Actually, it might resemble a small  Chriskindlemart.  It could also be viewed as an expo of sorts with companies that make a product unique to Kalamazoo County.  Anyone who makes a product in Kalamazoo County is able to sell their product, table booths are $50 for the night (tables provided)."

kzoo,2mt7i1,Paris-R,5,Wed Nov 19 21:39:01 2014 UTC,"Sadly yes. Its very common for them to be too overwhelmed with keeping the major roadways clear that they will skip side roads and neighborhoods. My advice is to find someone local who plows and pay them the $20, or however much it is for them to clear your cul-de-sac."
kzoo,2mt7i1,ReadyForForever,2,Wed Nov 19 21:50:25 2014 UTC,This is such a shame. I was hoping the plowing would be a little more frequent this year. I'll have to call around tomorrow to see how much it will possibly cost to plow out from my house to the main road (around 8 blocks snowed in). Though I suppose it will be futile to pay for something the city plows should be caring for themselves; Mlive says to expect 10 more inches by Friday.
kzoo,2mt7i1,ReadyForForever,3,Wed Nov 19 22:00:39 2014 UTC,If you can I would talk to your neighbors and see if any of them would like to go in on it with you. You might be able to negotiate a better price with some places if you can garantee you need them all winter. Is your cul-de-sac a private owned neighborhood? That could be why they dont come down.
kzoo,2mt7i1,dutchie727,3,Wed Nov 19 22:49:30 2014 UTC,You are so right in asking that question.  A lot of people in these cookie cutter subs put up by local contractors don't realize that they aren't actually living on city streets and that's why you don't see plows.

Sometimes they are quick,  sometimes not so quick.   Last year i think they had a new driver that rather than turning down the cul-de-sac that are off my screen just drove right by,  leaving a two foot barricade of hard packed snow blocking the road for the 10 houses down that street.

Slightly turn your wheels toward the direction you are sliding off and gently press the gas. This will cause your front end to direct you forward and away from the curb.

Carry cat litter to use for traction, if you have no cat litter, your cars floor mat might help.  Keep a couple of tea light candles in case you break down. Don't follow a bus up a steep hill, it's fucking guaranteed that it will stop halfway up. Don't wear any cotton, it absorbs sweat and will make you colder. Snow blindness is real and it really sucks. Throw some sunglasses on. If your hands are numb bend over at the waist and let your arms hang limp and then flap them in an exaggerated manner to get blood flowing to your fingers.

Not only is it fugly, it's an outright assault on one's sense of space... it looks like a bunker or a hazardous waste facility.  As for the rest of the lot, well, it's just what our community needed... another 5 acre pavement desert with a giant windowless concrete box stuck in the middle of it.    It's culturally bereft and in terms of the language of civic architecture, it's basically an enormous tumor.  The things subtly communicated by that building to the people observing it are aggressively anti-community and even somewhat hostile.  edit:  For more in this same vein watch this."

kzoo,2l9z0e,diyorgasms,7,Tue Nov 4 17:11:25 2014 UTC,"I strongly disagree with this, and agree with Matt Smith from the article.  It's unenforceable, tramples on the 1st Amendment right to freedom of speech, and basically amounts to privileged people legally hassling the less fortunate.  Don't get me wrong, I understand that it can be uncomfortable downtown... just stand outside the library for five minutes, and you'll get solicited... but frankly, it's a public space, and there should be no prohibition to free speech in those spaces.  Imagine a counter-example - can we prohibit a preacher from approaching a citizen in Bronson Park with a Bible Tract? Or even just preaching in the park and perhaps ""leaving a lasting impression"" on someone?    I sincerely hope the first homeless person cited under this ordinance takes it straight to court where any sane judge will immediately overturn this thing.  Seems to me that the City Commission has much more important matters to attend to than passing largely symbolic measures that will have little effect on the city."
kzoo,2l9z0e,rchase,4,Tue Nov 4 19:20:06 2014 UTC,"I'm right there with you. This ordinance basically makes it illegal to be poor, and prioritizes the rights of the wealthy to forget there are poor people over the right of the poor to ask for assistance.  When you make it illegal to panhandle, you are actually criminalizing saying ""I'm poor and I need help."""
kzoo,2l9z0e,Betrayus,9,Tue Nov 4 19:33:45 2014 UTC,"Eh yeah but can't we agree it does it out of hand sometimes. It sounds like this action was taken because people were getting solicited while eating outside and such on kzoo mall. It's a grey area in my opinion and I don't think this is too strict of a law.   For instance, just yesterday I had a homeless man knock of my door and ask if I had any cans to give him, I said no, and he proceeded to ask for spare change, I said no, then proceeded to continue to give me some dumb story about why he needs money. I slammed the door in his face, I don't feel bad, they take it too far too often."
kzoo,2l9z0e,platoreborn,5,Tue Nov 4 21:08:33 2014 UTC,"It certainly does get out of hand. There is one bum living in the yards of my vacant neighbors houses.  I've given food to bums just to watch them walk a block down the street and throw it away. Or tell me they don't eat a certain food and won't take it. I tried giving one a sub and he said,  ""I don't eat subs"", while carrying a subway sub and asking for food.  They do come into the bars and harass people for money, not just on the street.  Other cities make panhandlers get a permit by showing that they have a need to beg.  Most of the regulars in town aren't homeless.  Our city has a lot of resources for them, but that is limited to food, clothing and a place to sleep. Not money for booze and smokes."
kzoo,2l9z0e,J973,-3,Wed Nov 5 02:32:17 2014 UTC,"Sure, but what that fella did was in violation of existing ordinance. When you are sitting outside, do you have the right not to hear people's misery? If you are on a business' patio, can you reasonably be upset about the sound of traffic on the street?  The existing ordinance states that once they have received a negative response, the person soliciting must move on. I think this about covers it. I don't think that people sitting outside have the right not to be bothered just because there is a waist-high fence around a patio.  If you want to be in private, go behind doors and a wall. If you want to be outdoors on a major street, then deal with what that encompasses."
kzoo,2l9z0e,AndyH13,7,Tue Nov 4 21:15:00 2014 UTC,"I would disagree, I find some homeless people scary and intimidating.   I might not have a lot of extra money, but feel pressured in to giving to make them go away quickly.   I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE TALKING TO ME IN PUBLIC-- it freaks me out.   I should have the right to a peaceful meal on a patio, if I am paying for it.  Period.  It then becomes a part of the establishment.   Honestly, the thought of getting harassed by panhandlers is yet another reason why I would never eat on a patio-- but I still don't think others should get harassed if they choose to want to eat outside on a nice day.   I guess we as a community need to make sure these people in need have access to free food and shelter.  If they have those things, then they shouldn't be asking for money... they should be trying to better themselves for a job.  Now... I have a farm.  I have a lot of work that my children and I have to do on our own, every day.   How many of those homeless panhandlers would bust their asses doing HARD manual labor for a few hours for money?  I bet if I asked around I wouldn't get too many takers.   It's a lot easier to beg others for money then to break your back for a few hours a day doing honest work."

kzoo,2kszle,SubtleObserver,11,Thu Oct 30 20:48:35 2014 UTC,"He's been in office for ages, and used to be a fairly open-minded guy, from what I've seen. He crossed the aisle on several issues back in the day. Lately, however, he's followed the Republican party into entrenchment, refusing to cross the aisle on any issue. I've written him on a couple issues and was pretty surprised when he wrote back that he disagreed with my ideas. In my mind, you're elected to represent your voters, not to push a national agenda (although I know that's how politics work these days, I probably would've felt less dismissed if I'd received a cogent explanation of his reasons for disagreement). In all of this, he's really only followed the nation in becoming less accommodating to others' viewpoints, but it isn't the direction I want things to go."
kzoo,2kszle,littlebugs,5,Thu Oct 30 22:09:57 2014 UTC,"I wrote to him about Keystone. It was (IMO) a well thought out piece and I didn't attack him at all. I was polite, concise and to the point about why I felt it was important for him as my representative not to support it.  He sent my letter back with a paragraph  etched at the bottom of the page, plus his signature, but only the first three words of the sentence mattered to me.  ""Are you stupid?"" - Fred Upton  I will always vote against him. Paul Clements is a very polite and understanding gentleman from my area, and speaking with people whom are close to him he sounds like the kind of person I want to represent me."

There was testimony given about the issue, including farmers claiming wolf attacks on their land. The stories weren't true.   Basically the two proposals are an end-run around what the voters already have done, and if you believe the hype, it's because the governor's high-dollar friends want to trophy hunt endangered species.   That last part really is all I need to know- I'm all for conservation and hunting, but there is a- no valid reason to hunt an endangered species, and b- there are organizations whose purpose is to help hunters keep their livestock safe in ways that don't equate to killing other animals."

No, the principles that are best for everyone would be principles that are pro-social, such as job-creation, health care, education, housing, and access to food and water.    . . .instead of the politicians that will serve my own narrow, self interest?    Are you saying that democrats have a more narrow self-interest than republicans? Or do you mean that voting a straight ticket in a two-party system is detrimental to any broad social reform?  Corruption, cronyism, and corporate favoritism are rife among both parties, but at least the dems make a show of trying to protect our natural resources, our children, and our elderly. The republicans, especially the tea party traitors, would throw them all to the wolves if it meant WalMart could make an extra half percent or so."
kzoo,2kszle,ArMcK,1 point,Sat Nov 1 00:13:05 2014 UTC,My statement was completely apolitical. I don't agree with the idea that someone's personal situation should determine who they vote for. If a rich person thinks a democrat is the better choice than vote dem. If a poor person thinks a republican will do a better job than vote rep.

kzoo,2ktgkf,jasenlee,0,Fri Oct 31 15:25:17 2014 UTC,"Cool until they steal your shit.   True story from last Christmas holiday party ride:  ME: ""Hey driver... I'm going to a party and I need to bring a bottle of wine. Can we stop at XYZ liquor store and just keep the meter running and I'll be back in no less than 5... I already know the wine I'm getting"".   DRIVER: ""Absolutely""  That's it... no more dialogue needed.  I walk into the store and look back watching the driver taking off with my shit in the car and freak out. From everything I read Uber was supposed to be this upscale trustworthy service.   I call Uber (they had the driver number and everything) and tell them what happened and they are say ""sorry... you have to file a police report"".   I call the police and they are like ""sorry it's not our problem because they are an unregulated car service.""  I call Uber back and they tell me ""look... it's not our problem you have to deal with the police if it's theft.""  I call the police back and tell them ""this guy stole my shit!"" and their response again was ""sorry... it's not a regulated car/taxi service, you have to take it up with Uber."" I insisted that this was a clear example of theft but they still did nothing.  How often do I use them now? I think you can probably guess the answer to that question."
kzoo,2ktgkf,cbsteven,5,Fri Oct 31 06:05:09 2014 UTC,"Well, that sucks.... but you also should not have trusted them that much. Uber isn't ""this upscale trustworthy service"", it's an app that connects riders with drivers. I would only trust the driver a tiny bit more than a random guy a hitch a ride from, and that's just because I know the app will have the license plate and name on file."

That's definitely their bad for at least not thinking about how a milk-based sauce would be thickened, lol.  I'm sure it's been awhile since but I would recommend calling in and complaining. If I received such a complaint, the customer would receive a refund and a free meal for sure."
kzoo,2k5ara,eversaur,1 point,Mon Dec 15 12:39:54 2014 UTC,"Well, that's half correct. Depending on the restaurant, the employees ARE trained correctly to deal with allergies - we, for example, use a separate cutter for gluten free and a cutter for vegan/no cheese, washed after every use. All expo employees have that drilled into their heads.  However we also have a sign on the order taker station stating to customers that while we do everything we can, completely eliminating gluten contact with your pizza is impossible with the standards set by corporate. And that one flaw is simply because we aren't allowed a separate press for gluten allergies. Otherwise, our pizzas are almost completely untouched.   I do deeply apologize on behalf of whichever Blaze you visited - your complaints do matter! Call in and, of their management is up to par with my branch's, their employees will all be lectured on proper procedure."
kzoo,2k5ara,eversaur,1 point,Mon Dec 15 14:26:05 2014 UTC,"They dusted your crust? What? Our peel dust is a semolina-flour mixture that is very much not gluten free. They should not be doing that. As for sauce, we use a different vat and a different spoon, since it's the only ingredient that actually touches the dough.  They should really not be using any sort of dusting flour on your gluten free dough. At all. I mean, maybe I just grind my employees so hard on this because my best friend had Celiac's, but still."

kzoo,2k4em8,djhomebody,5,Thu Oct 23 19:05:32 2014 UTC,"They're creating a new transit authority to cover the parts of the county that get bus service. Right now, Kalamazoo city pays more but service extends out to the townships, Portage, and Parchment. The plan is to basically get the residents of the cities and townships that get bus service to pay their fair share. Some townships, such as the part of Texas Township with KVCC and part of Oshtemo Township with Meijer, have opted out of this authority. it's a bit early to speculate how this could effect things. If you live in a township that opted out, it wouldn't hurt to contact your elected officials. It's possible that KVCC could throw in a bit of money to keep busses running to their campus, since most people that go to KVCC probably don't live in Texas Township anyway. There'll be opportunities for public comment along the way as well. It's still pretty early in the process, so I wouldn't be totally worried yet, though it'll be good to keep an eye on how things unfold."

kzoo,2k09l5,littlebugs,1 point,Wed Oct 22 22:59:23 2014 UTC,"It's worth noting that even if Snyder vetoed it, it would've passed easily to override the veto in legislature.  Doesn't mean I support him, he still signed it. But he's no worse than our legislature."
kzoo,2k09l5,Gravitational_Bong,0,Mon Nov 3 07:33:24 2014 UTC,"Don't forget - wolf hunting is back on the ballot as well (vote no on both propositions to help stop wolf hunting, or vote yes if you support it). (While I'm here, no, I don't hunt, but looking into the structure of wolf packs shows that the loss of one animal can greatly affect the function of the pack as a whole. Meanwhile, since wolves and wolf packs represent an INCREDIBLY small threat to humans (and are not a good source for us), it seems plain selfish to start hunting them as game animals).  And my personal opinion is that Kalamazoo doesn't NEED a mayoral race in addition to its commissioner race. Right now the city commissioner receiving the most votes becomes mayor, the person receiving the second-most votes becomes vice-mayor. Change that up and you have people spending a lot more money on a separate political race and the loser (person with the second-most votes) has no role in city management at all."

That is a very well thought out change.  I like it!  edit:  Also I am adamantly opposed to wolf hunts.  Though it's a complex issue, and the populations need to be carefully monitored.  But to my knowledge (and I've studied it a bit) there is absolutely no rational justification for legal hunting at this time.  Let's be clear though, Michigan and wolves have had a very complex ecological history.  Take for instance Isle Royale."
kzoo,2k09l5,smegma_legs,-1,Wed Oct 22 18:47:06 2014 UTC,"What's ridiculous about it? My understanding is, the law remains virtually unchanged, and the only probable effect is that Tesla will now be able to sell through other companies' dealership networks, rather than being required to establish its own (the wording was changed from ""its dealership network"" to just ""dealership network."""
kzoo,2k09l5,smegma_legs,4,Wed Oct 22 19:04:00 2014 UTC,"It's ridiculous for two reasons.  1). As you say, it simply ratifies existing laws and is therefore useless, a waste of time, and largely a PR move to court conservative votes just before an election, and b). Tesla doesn't use dealerships, it sells direct to the customer, and now they are effectively banned from using that business model in Michigan.    It's ridiculous, wasteful, backwards protectionist pandering which (largely through media confusion) makes Michigan look like a bunch of redneck morons who hate electric cars.  Let me be clear - that's not what the law does, but it really looks that way to the larger public."
kzoo,2k09l5,J973,0,Wed Oct 22 19:09:56 2014 UTC,"But they were already banned from selling directly to customers, and now at least they're able to use the dealership networks already established rather than having to establish their own. Do you see how this improves Tesla's position?"
kzoo,2k09l5,smegma_legs,3,Wed Oct 22 19:20:05 2014 UTC,"I'm completely getting you.  But here's my take... why (re)-legislate to force a legitimate innovator in the automotive industry to comply with an outmoded business model?  The answer is simple: votes.    It's a PR stunt to garner votes.  The media controversy (of which there really is none) serves only to galvanize Snyder's constituency.  Search ""Snyder"" on Google right now... his brash protectionist Potemkin Village is the top link.  The entire endeavor is a complete waste of time and has no effect whatsoever on Tesla Motors, the Big 2, or really... anything.    It's just political theater, and I stand by my claim that it is completely ridiculous."

For whatever reason, about half of it is from the basement of OptiMed Pharmacy. All of it was cheap ($5-$25 for prints; originals for $30-$70). We've seen a lot more that we liked in the <$200 price range too.  If you aren't in a rush, try going to a few Art Hops to see what you like there.

For example, the haunting existential themes presented in Winnie-the-Pooh eating a jar of honey over a series of authentic aluminum-framed prints. Or, you can seek the captivating beauty of reproduction movie posters, Precious Moments folk art, and amateur religious iconography.  Why obey society's rules? Let the plebs go to the art galleries and spend more than $6 per piece. Simply stay at home, drink the finest diet grape soda, and relax in front of a breathtaking watercolor of a wizard riding a unicorn on a rainbow in space.

One complaint (actually I haven't even used it southbound on Oakland yet, so I reserve judgment on that):  West bound on Parkview they've kept the race-to-merge right lane.  I completely understand why it's there, but it's still a death trap.  Between people in the right lane going NASCAR-mode to merge in front of sensible folks, elderly shoppers turning left from the left lane into the D&W parking lot, and rich drunk spinsters meandering their way into into or out of Bacchus in the right lane... it's a still a complete clusterfuck.  The intersection has been ""open"" (it's not completed yet) for 2 days, and I've been dangerously cut off twice traveling westbound, and almost hit by a distracted woman (well, let's be honest... bitch) on a cell phone bursting out of D&W turning left across traffic and being, of course, completely oblivious to the rest of the world around her.  The intersection is definitely better (since it's finally paved), but I'm not sure if the new design is better yet.  But at least it's repaved.  We've got that.  As a fellow cyclist, I would still treat that intersection with extreme caution."

kzoo,2jdkwe,Methorabri,2,Thu Oct 16 02:11:00 2014 UTC,"IT is pretty drama filled and questionable leadership. HR has some dated policies; as of a year ago, no in place promotions and wage freezes. Also tend to pay 20% under wage averages because ""not for profit"". In my case, this was under state average. With all that, it does have good people in many places, and is a great place to learn and move on from."

There's really no such thing as a ""promotion"" at Bronson. And I agree that wages seem to be less than comparable positions at other companies. I do enjoy my co-workers though, which is the biggest reason I go back every day."

kzoo,2jca02,Duckfloss,3,Wed Oct 15 18:28:41 2014 UTC,I would be upset if Upton was reelected. Congrats to mayday for investing in our future.
kzoo,2jca02,bbqturtle,1 point,Thu Oct 16 14:21:19 2014 UTC,"I cannot imagine a scenario where Fred Upton doesn't maintain his seat, though I would love to see him dethroned.  Though Kalamazoo has a decently liberal constituency (it's a college town after all), you have to consider the bulk of Upton's district.  I grew up in St. Joseph (Upton's home town), and the Upton family basically built that city - they are the founders of Whirlpool Corporation, and Upton is, for reference, immensely wealthy from that legacy - he's a trust fund boomer (if you've ever seen the comedy Parks and Recreation - Fred Upton is literally Bobby Newport).  All of those small towns on the lakeshore (St. Joseph especially) are extremely conservative, and they vote assiduously.    My grandfather was a Michigan State Representative back in the '70s (44th district... Benton Harbor), and even in economically depressed, 90% African American BH he had to run Republican to get elected.  It's just my informed opinion, but trust me, Upton will overwhelmingly defeat any Democrat given his district and legacy."

kzoo,2iuqy1,Malakus,7,Fri Oct 10 14:24:25 2014 UTC,WMU keeps fucking up the design of this property.  I have no idea why they wanted to block the steps leading up to East Campus as the new wall doesn't even match the aesthetic.  The trees were beautiful too.  They could have responded by saying that they plan to plant more trees but I guess they just want this sober looking thing as is.
kzoo,2iuqy1,urbaneyezcom,4,Fri Oct 10 14:11:23 2014 UTC,"When I was attending WMU in 1987 I worked for a year in North Hall in the Business Library.  It was an amazing place.  Even back then, the building was pretty rickety, but still well maintained and solid (they just don't build 'em like that anymore).  The library was so fucking cool, ""the stacks"" were a several storey iron-work and marble tile scaffold with an ancient dumbwaiter for moving books up and down levels for re-shelving.  I absolutely loved hanging out in that old haunted-feeling space.  I also loved the long stair down to Oakland, and climbed it daily to get to work, and then back down at break to grab hot dogs at Dairy Queen.  It was a nice contemplative place.  I despise what WMU is doing with the East Campus property.  I would have much preferred a restoration / modernization project which probably would've been less expensive, and been much more respectful of the history in those magnificent old buildings.    I've recently returned to WMU to complete my degree after a short couple decade long break, and I appreciate much of the renovation that has been done.  I'm not really happy with the abandonment of McCracken Hall, which is a pretty cool, if ugly building (I'm not much of a fan of post-WWII brutalism in architecture).  Seems that facility could be put to much use.  But I do appreciate the Sangren refurb, and the Chemistry building and Gwen Frostic art school are certainly first rate.    But this East Campus thing just pisses me off.  Not only is that location an important part of Kalamazoo's history, they've destroyed some very special places to me personally as well.  Sad."
kzoo,2iuqy1,rchase,5,Fri Oct 10 20:23:00 2014 UTC,"It's this or they were going to tear it down. As cool as it was to chill on the steps in seclusion and how awesome that hill was, east hall was expensive for WMU. They didn't want to fund a place like that for people. They wanted to tear it down, so is what they're doing with it instead just rubbing it in your face?  I had lots of good memories up there but.. There's lots of other places in town. And to me at least they didn't tear it down."
kzoo,2iuqy1,Timecook,4,Fri Oct 10 15:42:43 2014 UTC,"Some people will never be happy with what they do.  I figured there wouldn't be enough money to save any of the East Campus buildings.    Shit, if people are that mad about it.. Get involved.  Convince people of ""your"" point of view.  Make it better."
kzoo,2iuqy1,urbaneyezcom,2,Fri Oct 10 20:56:37 2014 UTC,This has nothing to do with seclusion and everything to do with aesthetic.  The fact is they wanted to sell it to condo development but they instead decided to rehab this building.  Rehabbing the building and cutting down 200 year old maple and oak trees are mutually exclusive.  They could have rehabbed the building and kept the trees.  That hill is one of the most beautiful areas in all of Kalamazoo and they decided to cut down some of its nature to erect a fucking retention wall.  That's unacceptable to me.
kzoo,2iuqy1,Timecook,1 point,Fri Oct 10 18:07:02 2014 UTC,Well it's not done yet and I don't think they're going with the original idea of building a parking lot back there. I doubt they'd bring down those trees to just show off an ugly building.

Then from there as long as the Doc thinks you deserve it you can get your card. As far as the pot is concerned you need to either find a dispensary (none in Kzoo) or a qualified distributor."

Not sure about the ""near WMU part,"" unless its from the point of view of someone who considers all of Kalamazoo to be ""near WMU,"" as the render and description lead me to believe they're talking about linking up where the trail ends around North Street through downtown and that looks like the intersection of Main / Michigan / etc looking at Westnedge beyond.    As much as I would love a good way to get through downtown via bike, that potion of W Michigan gets rather busy during rush hours; I'm not sure how well it could stand to losing two lanes without engineering alternative vehicle routes through downtown."

kzoo,2itauw,berger77,5,Fri Oct 10 03:27:03 2014 UTC,part of the reason you don’t see many bikers is that they are scared of taking a lane on a 4 lane one-way street.

In my experience they don't have horrible customer service, I had many more problems with comcast back on the eastside of the state. Anyways, I payed $30 install fee, and $30/month FLAT for just internet, if any anyone tells you it's more than that they are lying (I had friends who went through some weird ConnectAll company? And tried charging them ridiculous prices for the same internet, while still through charter.) i have always been happy, couple of moves and always had 50-65mbps speed at each house.  Also they try to charge you an extra $5/month to ""rent"" a wireless modem. You can get faster ones on amazon for ~30. Pays for itself in 6 months and you keep it.   TL;DR $30 install fee, $30/month for 65mbps internet. Happy customer."

kzoo,2ijdj6,diyorgasms,7,Thu Oct 9 19:15:44 2014 UTC,"I strongly recommend Charter. AT&T provides nearly unusable speeds if you do any sort of media streaming. Plus, as weird as it is to say this, I have never had problems with Charter customer service. And, in fact, the only outage I have had with them was their nationwide DNS outage, which was not really an outage because I just spun up a DNS server on my own network and I was fine.   That and the fact that they doubled my speeds (from 30Mbps to 60Mbsp) without charging me more is pretty cool. And, I consistently am able to download at speeds even higher than what I am paying for."

Their customer service is solid as well. Great speed for the price. We pay about 35/month for 60mbps with no cap or anything like that.  Not sure if AT&T does this up here or not but, my parents have them down in St joe (about an hour SW of Kzoo) and they have a monthly bandwidth cap. It's really annoying when I go down there for holidays and stuff. My roommates and I (all gamers) had ATT for about a week when we first moved up here and it was so slow the internet was almost useless.

The cast spent Spring semester last year interviewing students and faculty around campus about the subject of racism here on campus and within the Kalamazoo community. The show was compiled and written from direct quotes from those interviewed, showing their experiences in an eye-opening manner, reminding everyone to 'check their privilege' and reflect upon how not everyone has the same privilege within our society."

And the paycheck thing is real; my checks bounced multiple times.  We were constantly having to pay our workers with cash because of banking issues.

kzoo,2h2x6o,Pinkvomit,2,Mon Sep 22 00:57:09 2014 UTC,Jimmy John's rolls their delivery charge into the price of the sub. Depending on the store in town the prices inshop/delivery  Slims: $3.81/$4.35 Subs: $4.87/$5.40 Clubs: $5.93/$6.45  Chips/Pickles: $1.16/$1.25 Cookies: $1.58/$1.75
kzoo,2h2x6o,HyphySymphony,2,Mon Sep 22 04:52:26 2014 UTC,See I hate that. As far as I know JJ's (and pretty much every delivery place) still only pay their drivers a small amount that is supposed to be supplemented by the customer tipping (don't get me started on that). So in order to get delivery you have to pay extra AND tip? AND the company doesnt pass the delivery charge on?
kzoo,2h2x6o,xTomBx,3,Mon Sep 22 14:49:21 2014 UTC,A few years ago I saw a guy delivering for Jim John's in a $30k+ Audi...times is tough.
kzoo,2h2x6o,platoreborn,1 point,Mon Sep 22 17:21:05 2014 UTC,The way Jimmy John's pays their drivers: (it's a tough system to understand and explain) You get 5% of your sales as reimbursement so if you did $50 in sales you would get $6.50/hr + tips + 2.50. It's a horrible system because it doesn't cover gas or vehicle repair in anyway. Where as at Cottage Inn or Papa John's you get minimum wage + the delivery charge ($1-2) + tips.

kzoo,2gvrqx,bbqturtle,7,Fri Sep 19 18:17:13 2014 UTC,"Maybe a bit more than you're looking for but Fort Custer has rustic family cabins that they rent out for something like $60 a night.  These are NOT the mini-cabins in the regular campground.  These are secluded, with long dirt two-track roads leading to them.  You'll need directions to find them, and probably have to go through a gate to get back there.  The one I've been to had a bunch of bunk beds and a couple tables inside. Heated with propane, can't remember if there were lights, a pit toilet, a water pump, a grill, and a huge place for a bonfire.   The thing is that the rules say that they lock gates at 10 (they didn't when I was there), so no in/out after that. But that means everyone can get totally trashed and crash out on a bunk bed, no worries about driving.  Takes a little bit of planning but it's worth it"

My recommendation is to hook up with a good agency with a lot of homes to sell, but not too many agents.    Don't expect to sell the million dollar McMansions right away either.  The noobs get the crap houses to list and see what they can do.  Something you can do is invest in selling yourself.  Nice car, but not extravagant.  Plenty of business cards with your picture on them.  Neighborhood mailers put out every quarter.  Put your face and name out there for 'brand recognition'.  Make sure you are hooked up with GKAR (Greater Kalamazoo Association of Realtors)and attend the meetings and seminars.  Join a local BNI chapter, the referrals are worth every penny of the annual membership fee and you'll make that back within your first two months!  Good Luck!"

I was told their signal is much weaker than the other stations.  Why? I don't know.  Back in the analog days, 3 and 8 were always harder to get because they were VHF and low on the bandwidth. Not sure if that is the case with the digital signal."

I think I'm just going to take back the $80 antenna and pick up one of the cheaper ones as it seems I'll only be able to get FOX and ABC anyway.

I lived at Summer Ridge and they had 2 bedroom units for less than 1,000/month and had garages available. Right off of 131 too so it made getting around really easy (not having to mess around with Westnedge at 5pm to get into Portage is nice!). Lots of young professionals/graduate students/older retired folks living there. Very quite, peaceful, has a tennis court and a pool too if you're interested in those. Only draw back is it is kind of a ways from downtown so if you're into going to the scene down there it could make things tricky. Other than that though, couldn't recommend  them enough."

kzoo,2g9wsl,JimJimBinks,2,Sat Sep 13 22:07:09 2014 UTC,"What part of California are you coming from? I grew up in the San Fernando Valley and moved to Portage in 2006. I was 27 at the time.  You might miss the California weather, but there's a long list of stuff keeping me from ever wanting to move back to California.  #1 being cost of living. When my wife and I moved here with our dog, we rented a really nice 4 bedroom house in portage for $1000 a month. Coming from CA, that seemed like a steal, but it turned out to be really expensive for the area. You shouldn't have a problem finding an apartment for rent at under $1000. Also, you will be amazed at the traffic, or lack thereof when compared to parts of CA. Given the timing of this message, it sounds like you'll be moving here just before Winter. That's a shame because I've heard this winter will be bad. That being said, as a Californian who had never spent much time in snow, I really enjoyed all the winters here up until last year. Last year was a pain in the ass. All the other seasons though, are so nice. I never really experienced changing seasons in CA. Here though, it's really pretty. You can't help but appreciate it.

kzoo,2g9wsl,ellipsis324,3,Mon Sep 15 12:44:54 2014 UTC,"First off, congrats! Kalamazoo is a great place to live and work. It may not seem like much compared to what you had in California, but it's a nice college city.  That being said, here is some advice related to your questions:  1) I don't know of any gated communities in the area.  There may be some, but I think they would probably be area with some very old people.  There really is no reason to live in a gated community.  There isn't enough crime to justify it.  As for specifics of where to live, I cannot really say, but I will say that it is very doable for $1000.  Perhaps not the garage, though. I've found those to be pretty rare in the area. Most of the neighborhoods in the area are safe, but I wouldn't recommend anywhere north of Kalamazoo Ave.  Also, the Vine neighborhood (near Vine St.) has a large student population for WMU, and if you aren't interested in the occasional couch burning and late night parties you may want to stay away from there, as well.  I obviously don't know where your job is, but depending on how long you care your commute time is you may also be interested in living outside of Kalamazoo in one of the surrounding cities/townships/etc.  Portage is where most of the people in the area live.  I can make some more recommendations if you care to ask.  2) Snow.  Yes. Well.  It can be pretty brutal, especially for people new to the ""experience.""   Basics for humans in cold: Wear layers. Wear shoes that won't get wet. Cover your extremities; you don't want frostbite. Stay inside, wear a Snuggie, drink lots of cocoa and relax! :D  Here are some basics for your vehicle: get snow tires for winter, or at the very least get some good all-season tires.  Also, make sure if you have snow tires to have them switched back out for the regular tires at the end of the season.  Don't be stupid when it comes to snow. If it's snowing hard or slippery, slow the fuck down.  It's common sense, but some people don't seem to realize that.  If you have 4-wheel drive, you will be lucky.  Carry a container of kitty litter or sand in the back of your vehicle. (It will add weight to held give you traction on the road and also if you get stuck, it is great to put under the tires to try to help get you out.)  Remember that when slipping on ice that you need to turn your wheel into the direction your vehicle is sliding.  It seems counter-intuitive, but that's how science works.  Buy a good shovel.  Keep a brush/scraper in your vehicle so you can actually see out the windows.  It's all pretty basic stuff, but sometimes people just ignore it because it takes time or they are late for work, etc.  Just be safe and smart and you'll be fine. :)  3) I know nothing of cars, so you'll need to ask someone something else about that!  Though, I do know of the Michigan International Speedway which is about an hour away near Jackson, MI.  Any other questions, feel free to ask!  Source: I lived in the Zoo for the last 6 years and just recently moved out for my own job."
kzoo,2g9wsl,PrincessStudbull,3,Sat Sep 13 13:34:37 2014 UTC,"A brush/scraper in the house as well. For those mornings you wake up to 8-10"" on the car and if you open the doors to get the scraper, the snow is going to fall into the car.   OP: you can rent a modestly sized house for $850-950, as well.  There are certain apartment complexes that are known for higher than normal police visits, but overall, keeping in mind the areas mentioned above, we are not exceptionally crime-filled here."
kzoo,2g9wsl,robotsneedhugs2,1 point,Sat Sep 13 19:32:18 2014 UTC,Thank you for responding and giving me some good advice.  I will definitely check out portage since I've been seeing that come up a lot when searching.
kzoo,2g9wsl,robotsneedhugs2,2,Sat Sep 13 16:12:59 2014 UTC,"Finding a 1 bed 1 bath apartment for under 1000 should be pretty easy. The cost of living is far less here than in California. As far as where to look, Gull Run, Candlewyck Apartments, and Coopers Landing are some of the nicer ones. Prices around 500-800/month I think. Subletting a room in a house would be cheaper and there are a lot of houses around, just stay away from the north side of Kalamazoo, and parts of the Vine neighborhood (commonly referred to as the Student Ghetto) are a little sketchy too.   As far as the winters here, it's going to take some getting used to. But even if it's been 15 years, it's kind of like riding a bike. Last winter was the worst one Michigan has had since the 70s I think. Temps were in the double negatives or single digits almost all winter long and we got a ridiculous amount of snow.   If your car has FWD, I highly, highly recommend investing in some snow tires. Buying tires sucks but trust me, it's worth it. If you have a truck with 4WD or something with AWD you should be okay. If you have RWD, I might want to get something else to drive for the winter because you're going to be fish tailing around corners like crazy and getting stuck a lot.   Hope this helps!"
kzoo,2g9wsl,robotsneedhugs2,1 point,Sat Sep 13 14:04:08 2014 UTC,Thank you!  I am definitely not bringing my car when I come so I'll have the luxury of buying something else which is will be awd.  (My cars a rwd convertible which I doubt will last long in winter )
kzoo,2g9wsl,Macboogie,2,Sat Sep 13 16:14:41 2014 UTC,"Do you know anyone local that can take you to a large parking lot when it snows? That way you can get a feel for how to slow down, how to accelerate (heavy on the gas in snow gets nothing done), etc. once your anxiety is a bit less, snow driving is simply slow, mindful, ""get there when you get there"" driving."

I'm pretty irritated that they are stopping package accepting in front office.   That was a big selling point for me when I went over the place.

All the big muscle cars, motorcycles, ricers, anybody with a cool car really goes up there to show off their ride. The best time to head up there is around sunset I think.

Also your right. it was an old tuberculosis hospital - I've had  so many people over the years tell me it was an old insane asylum (if you're interested William Decker who ran the psychiatric facility on Oakland wrote a really awesome history of the psychiatric one - portage library has a copy)  Um.....tldr - watch out for junkies :)
kzoo,2fjvi1,notChuckFinnley,4,Fri Sep 5 14:43:04 2014 UTC,"I spent a lot of time in that hospital (no, I'm not a junkie). It was a lot of fun. We actually disassembled a pool table and took it out of there. The top floor was the children's ward. ceilings were low. All other floors were the same except the basement. The basement had the kitchens, rec rooms, coolers, morgue, furnace room, and a weird room with a restraint table. All tile."

kzoo,2fjvi1,Gravitational_Bong,1 point,Sat Sep 6 03:05:54 2014 UTC,"ooh story time.  Somewhere between 8 and 10 years ago, I used to have some friends that used to live across the street from the old TB asylum (fun fact, malcolm x's mother used to be there purportedly) and I knew that place inside and out.  I used to take people through it.  There was a hole in the fence on the winding road that went on one side of it, and the front main gate has enough of a gap under it to slip under.  Western owned the property at the time and the worst you would get from going there would be a trespassing fine, according to a few of my friends who have been caught.  Normally, entrance to the building would be through a broken window by the playground behind the asylum.  Sometimes they would board it up, but nothing a crowbar couldn't take care of.  The entrance would lead into an area that seemed to be a small sort of auditorium, with a stage about the size of the old corner bar's stage (sans the shitty pole.)  Anyways, the stairwell nearest that entry point was blocked by a pool table lodged in it so to get to the roof you would have to take the middle stairwell.  Generally, I would take people just before the sun set so we could go to the roof and get inebriated while watching the sun set.  It was perfect because it was pretty serene and it set a good contrast to the dark interior after the sun set.  Generally, most homeless that camped out there stayed on the third floor, which was evident by the smell and all the garbage, including the occasional garbage fire for light and heat.  Some of the rooms felt more eerie than others, and the way it was set up made it seem like it was abandoned quickly.  Supposedly there had been two fires, one while it was still operational and one after it had been abandoned.  My friend's father used to work there.  You can see some of the fire damage toward the front side of the building in what appeared to be an office.  The creepiest part by far, however, was the basement.  A few key rooms gave me chills every time I was there.  One room was at least 50 feet by 50 feet and aside from 4 support beams by each corner was furnished only by a single chair that resembled the chairs they have at a barber shop, only this chair had straps all over it, supposedly to secure a patient down.  This chair was directly in the middle of the room, and when I sat in it I was always super uncomfortable, whether it was because of the things I had imagined happening in the chair or the fact that it was acoustically very strange in the middle of the room, I'm not sure.  Another room, affectionately named the morgue, had two of those sliding body storage things and a large chute that went to a furnace.  The power control room was also downstairs, and it's really satisfying to throw those giant switches and hear them clink.  I'm not sure what the situation is like now, but i'm sure that people live there every now and then, almost always on the third floor for some reason.  It's got a very silent hill vibe to it and I would recommend checking it out if this is the sort of thing that interests you.  Just be careful, it may not be very structurally sound.  A few of the 'paranormal' things i've heard of/noticed would be:  hearing a moaning through the elevator shaft (be careful around this thing)  shadows in peripheral vision near the stage  echoes having extra sounds in the chair room  footsteps coming from places where you're fairly certain nobody is.  not to say there are ghosts or anything, all the things i've noticed can be explained very logically, but it's a creepy atmosphere and you tend to notice (or imagine) these things more when you're uneasy.  what you saw dart across the street was probably someone using a hold in the fence there to enter/exit."

Anyway, we were exploring the outside and I noticed one room on the third floor who's curtains were moving. They were sort of blowing but there was no wind and nothing else was moving. It creeped me out so I kept an eye on it. A little later I saw a shadowy figure in the same window. Could have been a person, I know people used to go inside. But it still gave me chills and I wanted very badly to get out if there."
kzoo,2fjvi1,latkin24,1 point,Sat Sep 6 04:21:07 2014 UTC,"In the few years right before they tore it down, when OP got spooked by something watching him, was likely because during that time there were quite a few tweakers going up there to cook meth in pop bottles, or whatever it is they do. Both in and around the area of the Blakeslee Sanitarium. They are always really paranoid and probably would have been watching who was coming up and down. I live around there now, and have lived in other spots right around there years past. I've never really seen anything paranormal, But I did see a deer trying to jump the fence and almost break it's leg.   I did experience something creepy, unrelated to the sanitarium, right around there several years back. I was walking my dog down the trail off Blakeslee which leads to what is now the dog park, and he kept trying to pull me over towards some brush with what looked like illegally dumped garbage behind it, I heard someone else with a dog coming and I got out of there fast because my dog is anti-social. By the time I looped back around, Public Safety was on their way up the hill, because unfortunately, behind the brush was a woman who had been murdered then disposed of up there"

Craigslist will always have something available but you'll also see some if you google Kalamazoo duplex or house rentals. If you wanna stay close to campus and cheap, look in the Vine neighborhood. The cost gets higher as you move north through South St and into the Stuart neighborhood. Go west and you'll be closer to both K College and WMU in West Main hill.  Gets a big harder to find places there and you gotta time your search to around the March-April time frame and sign for August. South of WMU is the frat village area.

The going rate in the area for an apartment in a complex is about a dollar per square foot per month, +/- 50 bucks depending on the quality of the complex and amenities.   Their internet plan is fine for casual users.  But there's a 250GB per month limit.  That's about 8 gigs a day.  For a gamer that's not enough.  If you live with a casual gamer and like to watch a TV show or movie from Netflix it's not enough."

It's gone up $10/month the last two years and I'm getting ready to sign another this month so it will be $470/month.  I watch more Netflix than I care to admit and have zero problems with it.  I don't game so I can't speak to that but for my internet usage and Netflix watching, it's more than enough for me and the neighbor.  No grandfathering in on the rent; i just looked at their website and $470 is the going rate for a 1 bdrm."

kzoo,2ekd76,_high_plainsdrifter,1 point,Mon Aug 25 21:59:29 2014 UTC,"The police enforce the policies of the city, as does the prosecutor. My point is that it's really up to the city council (edit: it turns out we have a commission). Has anyone applied to the city for a license?  Now that I think about it, I wonder where the division between enforcing county code and city code comes into play-- don't we have a joint police force with Kalamazoo County? Hm...  Upon further research, changes to the city charter and the city commission itself have been able to affect law enforcement policy in at least these two ways: creating a new ordinance under which officers give ""appearance tickets"" rather than arresting the individual for marijuana possession; reducing the ""priority"" of marijuana possession of under one ounce to ""lowest priority.""  I think this demonstrates the city has jurisdiction. It's up to us. So what's the problem?"
kzoo,2ekd76,_high_plainsdrifter,1 point,Wed Aug 27 05:23:46 2014 UTC,"I can't attest to the lack of applications, or any real particular reason they're not around yet. My guess is figuring out the taxation/zoning/other administration.   My first comment was in reference to the way federalism works. The local police can choose to follow policy set forth by city council. But the state can also do things like threaten to take away $$.   I voted in favor of that law when it was on the ballot. But I knew it  was going to take some time to actually implement."
kzoo,2ekd76,_high_plainsdrifter,1 point,Wed Aug 27 20:31:27 2014 UTC,"I know that cities can force their police to operate under certain policies. For example, in Ann Arbor, city police are required to complain about marijuana possession only to the city attorney: this is how Ann Arbor ensures the civil infraction for marijuana possession (This is also the reason why U of M cops will still bust you: they're not limited by the city constitution in this way.). I don't see why Kalamazoo is any different, except possibly that police are shared with the county, but I think my previous examples rule that out.  I appreciate the well-thought responses. I am responding to you mainly because I am sure that others think the same as you, and I'd like to point out to all of you that -- while this is true by some accounts -- we're in a political war, and we should take some steps forward, and dictate to our police force, not let them dictate to us."
kzoo,2ekd76,ghoti023,1 point,Thu Aug 28 03:42:47 2014 UTC,"As for the county and city ""sharing police"", I'm not sure what you mean.  Yes, the Sheriffs Office has a presence. As do the township police or Kalamazoo Public Safety that are typically the folks on the beat/responding to calls. The County Sheriff's Office operates in a different capacity than the township police if I understand correctly. I'll look into it more."
kzoo,2ekd76,ghoti023,1 point,Thu Aug 28 22:06:32 2014 UTC,"Sorry, I meant the city shares with the township. I'm not sure how that works: do they enforce two different codes, one for each district? But I've also learned in the last couple days that many public servants in Kalamazoo double as police and firefighters, so there is apparently cross-over in many ways. Anyway, bottom line, the city has jurisdiction, and we have the ability to vote amendments into the city constitution that are capable of setting policy for enforcement. Many cities in Michigan have already done this, and 14 more are voting similarly this fall. I don't know our commissioners, yet, so I can't speak about the likelihood of moving them to act (thereby avoiding the need for a referendum)."

kzoo,2ekd76,zombiechris,1 point,Wed Aug 27 12:26:02 2014 UTC,"In other words, Kalamazoo has no guts. Cannabis is technically illegal for recreational use, but 14 cities in Michigan have referendii this fall to legalise (not decriminalise) recreational use of personal amounts of cannabis. Doesn't sound like state law is stopping these other cities, and many of these are small, somewhat conservative communities (compared with Kalamazoo).  Kalamazoo continues to grow on this former Ann Arborite. I hate to see the new city I love fall behind."

kzoo,2ekd76,zombiechris,1 point,Tue Aug 26 13:59:44 2014 UTC,"Agreed. But you don't have to go as far as San Diego. I read there are 15 dispensaries operating in Ann Arbor (I am from Ann Arbor, and I've been to at least 5 different dispensaries. Many opened and closed over the years.). I've heard there were many operating in Lansing early on-- perhaps these have also been shut down? I see online there are dispensaries in Battle Creek, Grand Rapids, Jackson: all very conservative communities by San Diegan standards. Yet nothing in Kalamazoo, which is clearly the most liberal of these 4 communities."

I have a lot of insight into the photography world and have worked with a lot of big names in the industry in terms of teaching. Infact. I'm the editor for Fstoppers.com, which is one of the largest photography websites in the world.  Here are some reviews on this workshop."
kzoo,2egwkn,platoreborn,1 point,Tue Aug 26 08:16:09 2014 UTC,That is good to know. I'm getting involved with starting up a local maker space here and I was hoping people enjoy these types of workshops.

kzoo,2e6n2y,dandiggler,1 point,Fri Aug 22 14:43:57 2014 UTC,"Coldbrook is my first pick - affordable, friendly and close. Beach is clean, water is beautiful, and they have canoe rentals. My boyfriend and I take our kayaks there. I love it. There's a disc golf course there too.   Fort Custer is very family-friendly, and does have an alcohol-free policy (just an FYI).   Markin Glenn is small with a nice beach and a smaller fishing pond next to the swimming lake. There's no kayak/canoes allowed there.   I loved Ionia State Recreation Area when we went there last year - great swimming, nice campsites, and they also had canoe and kayak rentals. It's a tad further away (outside of Grand Rapids).   Hope this helped! Have fun!"

kzoo,2dvxym,bbqturtle,2,Tue Aug 19 16:02:40 2014 UTC,"Each room in rented out separately, so if one person falls behind or stops paying their rent no one else is on the hook for it. If you look at other 4 bedroom apartments in similar student focused complexes, you may pay slightly less but most are only 3 bathrooms at most don't have the same kinds of amenities. My roommates and myself all found that paying rent here would cost less than trying to all have gym/tanning memberships and parking passes ect."

kzoo,2cu8j3,justagirlinthezoo,5,Thu Aug 7 00:37:49 2014 UTC,"Although I did a plasma donation in a different area, I don't think it's too different up here... But basically they'll ask you some basic questions related to your health (preexisting conditions,  current medications, etc.). I don't remember if there's a weight limit. They do take your blood pressure prior. Drink plenty of water and be hydrated before you go, this will make the ""collection"" go faster (it helps drinking water the day before you go). The clinic I went to you got paid the same day. They also use a special ink marked on your fingernail that they dab on before you start. They do this because they don't want you going to different clinics in the same day. The clinic I went to had a weekly limit in terms of payment. The first time you go in a week it was $30, than it was $20 the second time you went. In regards to going early, it would just depend on how many ""beds"" they have. The clinic I went to i waited usually 20-40minutes before they'd hook me up. Hope that helps, and good luck in the job hunt!"
kzoo,2cu8j3,RunRabbitsRun,4,Thu Aug 7 00:50:53 2014 UTC,"Your first time takes around four hours. Subsequent times take about an hour. Early really is better. Bring a blanket (I forget if they offer any), iPod, and a book. You'll be bored and cold.  Once you sign in, you may not leave until you're finished or else you won't be allowed to donate.  No donations allowed for six months after a tattoo, and for a year, I think after receiving blood. Don't make plans for after your first time. You'll be really tired.  Drink lots of water before.  You get a card that they deposit your payment to, fairly immediately iirc.  They share enough records with the other nearby donation centers to keep you from donating too much.  The bathrooms are clean at the beginning of the day, but pretty bad by the end of the day."
kzoo,2cu8j3,ArMcK,1 point,Thu Aug 7 03:32:12 2014 UTC,Do you happen to know what the hours are? How early do they open?
kzoo,2cu8j3,ArMcK,1 point,Thu Aug 7 11:30:01 2014 UTC,"Sorry, I don't remember for sure, but I think it was M-Sa 9-5."
kzoo,2cu8j3,captaincupcake234,3,Thu Aug 7 15:14:18 2014 UTC,"To answer your questions:  1.) Yes you get paid the day of. Wait an hour after the donation just in case to let them load the funds on a debit card the give you.  2.) Get there early. Mondays to Thursdays at 8 am is a good time. Fridays are usually packed....even before they open.  3.) Yes there is a physical. More on that below.  also, everything below is just extra info I give to anyone considering giving plasma.  I go to Biomat on Kalamazoo Ave 2 to 3 times a month for gas money. They have kind and funny staff, but they can get stressed out at times when there are alot of donors there because they don't have enough staff to handle huge numbers of doners. They have flats creeps there playing movies for doners to watch. It's a random selection. My first time there i got lucky because they had The Avengers playing!   The amount of $$ you get depends on how much plasma you donate. This amount is determined on how much you weigh. I'm a heavy guy so they take out almost a liter of plasma from me. My friend is not as heavy as I am, and she got $30 (I'm guessing a little less than half a liter).  If you have a student ID, show it to them, they will give you a $5 bonus the first time you are donating. They also give incentives for donating on specific weeks, referring friends (after their 4th visit), etc.  At your first time have your social security card (or copy of birth certificate) with you, drivers license (or state ID), student ID (optional for the $5 bonus, it can be an old one if you are not a student any more).   Drink plenty of fluids the night before and on the day of. They have a bathroom in there so if you have to pee, pee! You can't stop in the middle of the donation process to go pee. There is also a urine test, so if you have had plenty of fluids....You won't have any issues with having enough urine for the test.  Also eat a meal high in protein the night before, and eat a high protein meal at least 2 hours before the donation.  If you are a first time doner the process will take longer. They have to perform a physical (including a urine test) and they ask you a battery of questions (mostly repetitive questions) to make sure you have not been to countries that have large cases of aids, participated in high AIDS risk activities, been to prison, etc. (If you have donated blood to the Red Cross, they ask similar questions).  If you pass the physical and screening test, they need to take an initial small blood sample to see your red blood cell, iron, and plasma count. This involves using a small lancet on your finger (the kind diabetic s use to test their blood sugar level).  After you pass this, you get sent into the donation room to wait for a staff member who will call your name to confirm you are there. You wait a bit longer, then a staff member escorts you to a donation couch and machine. They will ask you which arm you want to be drawn from. Then you sit down,  they hook up the machine,  sterilize the arm area they will stick you with (using a dark brown iodine chemical....betadine I think...they use it everywhere in the medical field). Then they stick your arm with a fairly large needle (same kind of needle used for IV's), it's going to hurt, it's a giant needle...but only for a few seconds (I just close my eyes and grimace).  The machine separates your red blood cells from blood plasma (which your Red Blood Cells are suspended in). The machine takes the plasma gives you back your res blood cells plus saline solution in lieu of the plasma removed.  They also hook up a small bag of anti blood coagulant (so your blood doesn't suddenly clot while drawing...blood loves to naturally clot....it's just doing its job). They saline solution bag is a mixture of water and dissolved salts (basically electrolytes that were in your plasma, but not gone), it gets mixed with your red blood cells (sans plasma) so you get your liquids back. They give saline solution to female doners when they are low on supply. Male doners get a bottle of powerade.  Then you just sit there as the plasma machine does its thing. The machine uses a cuff to compress your arm when drawing blood (like a cuff on a blood pressure measuring device). They'll ask you to open and close your hand when the cuff is tight (helps blood flow better).  The machine will run between 2 to 5 cycles depending on how much plasma you are giving. Between cycles the cuff on your arm loosens, where you can take a break from opening and closing your hand.   During the part where the pump back in saline plus red blood cells, it will feel COLD! So have a warm fleece jacket draped over you...or a blanket (they also crank the AC when it's hot outside).  During the donation process staff members will be walking around checking on you and other doners. If you feel light headed, woozy, sick, etc....ease your hand and a staff member will assist you. You can't sleep during the donation process because if you have your eyes closed, staff will think you passed out (epoch makes sense, if someone actually passes out during the donation process it can be a major emergency).  Once the machine is done a staff member will come and unhook you (or just flag a staff member down).   They'll have you walk to the processing window and they'll hand you your debit card. Then you'll walk out a back door that exits on Kalamazoo Ave. To get to your car, just turn left, left again at the intersection and walk north to the parking lot less than a block away.  The while process for a new donor will take up between 2 to 4 hours because of all the screenings you have to go through. Every donation after that will take between 1.5 to 2.5 hours."
kzoo,2cu8j3,passthatDutcher,3,Fri Aug 8 15:58:02 2014 UTC,Short answer - not worth it.
kzoo,2cu8j3,jesselikesfood,2,Fri Aug 8 23:49:50 2014 UTC,"I work in one of the liquor shops here and see a lot of kids paying with the debit card they give you for donating, so I imagine it can't be that difficult of a process. Can't give deets about donating though, never done it"
kzoo,2cu8j3,Hersheyburger,2,Thu Aug 7 02:26:54 2014 UTC,My sister did it a few times and she ended up very sick/tired for like 2 weeks.
kzoo,2ctslb,Quiescencies,2,Wed Aug 6 21:52:57 2014 UTC,"This cat literally wandered inside of Harvey's On The Mall in downtown Kzoo last night. We took her in to the vet - no microchip, likely not spayed. She's incredibly friendly however and I have a hard time believing she's a stray. She was found with a flea collar on. She might be someone's outdoor cat but we didn't feel comfortable letting her loose downtown and didn't want to risk moving her in the wrong direction"

kzoo,2cmlji,tellme_areyoufree,0,Mon Aug 4 21:37:04 2014 UTC,I imagine that's where the money from the raised tuition and the programs that were cut over the past 6 years have gone.
kzoo,2cmlji,cmacdaddyswag,7,Tue Aug 5 14:44:53 2014 UTC,"So a lot of people aren't familiar with this, but - WMU School of Medicine is a PRIVATE medical school not run by or funded by WMU. It's a collaboration between WMU, Bronson, and Borgess.  The school is totally private - tuition is the same for in-state and out-of-state students specifically because the state school (WMU) does not fund the medical school.  Incoming medical students pay their $50,000-$60,000 of tuition to WMed directly, and undergraduates pay their $5000 directly to WMU. They're separate piles of money, completely separate."
kzoo,2cmlji,Ham-Grenade,0,Tue Aug 5 16:40:57 2014 UTC,Soooooo.... Where's all the extra charges going?
kzoo,2cmlji,juno672,3,Tue Aug 5 18:03:48 2014 UTC,"Most likely it's replacing money that just isn't there anymore.  Public colleges/universities across the country aren't typically raising tuition to bring in more money or expand budgets. They typically raise tuition to cover funds no longer provided by the state. For example, UMich had approximately 90% of its budget covered by the state of Michigan in the 50s and 60s. Today it's about 30%. Tuition has increased in most states because most states have progressively stripped more and more funding our from under universities.  In any case, it has absolutely nothing to do with the medical school. We receive no fees or tuition from WMU undergraduate or graduate programs. And speaking as a med student about to make his $50,000 payment - I wish like hell we did get some of those funds."
kzoo,2cmlji,bbqturtle,7,Tue Aug 5 18:17:55 2014 UTC,"Actually from a $100 million donation. I do know that WMU just added somewhere on the order of 6-10 programs, too."

kzoo,2cm54r,jrohlfing,2,Tue Aug 5 17:57:46 2014 UTC,If your definition of good is ... far then how about the Kal-Haven trail?  I haven't lived in Kazoo for 20 years but it was pretty fun back then.
kzoo,2cm54r,vihrea,3,Mon Aug 4 21:14:42 2014 UTC,"The Kal-Haven Trail is a great resource but there is something about walking in a straight line and then turning around and walking back the way I came that makes for a boring hike, IMO :)"

kzoo,2cknck,HundRetter,4,Mon Aug 4 08:43:28 2014 UTC,"I've been wondering how this setup works. Do people just form groups and play at a table, just like you would at a party? Or is there some other format?"
kzoo,2cknck,cbsteven,1 point,Mon Aug 4 14:25:06 2014 UTC,"It's interesting, and we've been experimenting it so if you do stop in and play, be sure to let us or the host Rod know if you have any ideas that might make it smoother. They originally started at the Houston location and we didn't like how they played, so we made it as follows:   You play the game normally in teams of 6-10 (obviously less if we have less, we can randomly pair people with groups as well) Each round is 20 minutes. At the end of each round the winner is the one with the most black cards per usual and there are prizes for each winner.   At the end of each round you set aside your black cards you've won each round and keep them to the end. The person from each table with the most cards from through out the game plays a ""super"" round against all the other most card winners. The host reads a black card, reads all the white cards given, and then the rest of the audience chooses."

They start you at 12.00/hr with good benefits and the like. The people you'd be working on the floor with are all really great people.  You have certainly missed the heyday of bells though. When I first started it had just begun to lose its ""were all a family here"" type of feel and become more of a typical warehouse job. It's monotonous work and you often feel unappreciated at the end of the day/week. Raises are small and only happen annually but you do receive by-annual bonuses that are quite nice (and free beer)  Let me know if you have any other questions."

kzoo,2ayi8g,arshavingmyballsack,3,Thu Jul 17 14:57:35 2014 UTC,"I never ran into any of those issues when I went to the course, except for the full trash cans.  I would definitely have paid to play at that course because it was a nice course to start on for people who are new to disc golf (like myself). It would've been an understandable decision if they had at least tried to work with the guy who had put all of the work into it.  It sucks that having the course around didn't bring much business into the museum, but after hearing about this, I know they won't be getting my business, either."
kzoo,2ayi8g,IndigoHero,3,Thu Jul 17 21:05:09 2014 UTC,"That made me angry while reading. From what I got out of it... Basically underage kids were drinking and smoking weed in the park. I have never attended the park but that doesn't seen like a reason to close it down, why not just increase police enforcement? Or maybe charge money and have security occasionally?"
kzoo,2ayi8g,Betrayus,2,Thu Jul 17 20:50:44 2014 UTC,Seems like a valid reason to close it to me. Air Zoo put this up at their expense and people treated it poorly. Charging access adds an entirely new layer of logistics and liability.
kzoo,2ayi8g,cbsteven,1 point,Fri Jul 18 13:15:11 2014 UTC,"The Air Zoo didn't treat it any better, to be honest. Course maintenance was performed by the community 90% of the time. Downed trees due to weather were never cleared, and if they were it was by the community. The groundskeeping was terrible; 6-8 of the fairways were usually overgrown.  The article states that people apparently complained about people fishing for discs in the retaining ponds; wouldn't have been a problem if they hadn't moved Hole 18 from inside the treeline to the outside. I lost 3 discs in there. And then they erected a fence right in the middle of the fairway on Hole 10 at the beginning of the year next to another pond.  And yes, there was plenty of trash on the course, but last year there were maybe 2 trash cans on the entire course. This year, they doubled it (omfg 4 cans on the entire course, whoop-de-FREAKIN-DO). I always picked up trash as I played, but the cans were never emptied. The only time I ever saw the cans emptied was by someone in the community.  Also, of course there's no business flowing into Air Zoo; they took out their disc golf shop at the beginning of last year. No one is going to go to the disc golf course and then visit the Air Zoo shop to buy model fucking airplanes because they're two separate demographics.  Plain and simply, it was poor planning on the Air Zoo's part. Whomever thought that college age kids would visit the course and then the museum just because it was two feet away is stone fucking dumb.  It's a damn shame that they decided to close the course. It was nice to have someplace nearby that I could bike to in the summer, and it would have been really nice to see the course if it had been properly taken care of by the people that decided to put it in. I hope they find someplace else in Portage to put in a replacement."
kzoo,2ayi8g,BrandonCarlson,1 point,Sat Jul 19 07:30:30 2014 UTC,"I really don't see why everyone is so butthurt about this. Of the people in 2014 that still play disc golf (which I'm not denigrating, it's fun), very few of them went to this course."
kzoo,2ayi8g,keldoftheisles,2,Fri Jul 18 01:46:09 2014 UTC,It was actually a great place to take people who were newer to the game in order to teach them how to play. Yes it was not as challenging as other courses around but its always nice to switch things up. Either way its one less course that we have available here in Kalamazoo so its a loss for disc golf in the area.he   The only other beginner friendly course in the area is Knollwood and I wouldn't want to take anyone new to the sport there due to the broken glass and garbage.
kzoo,2ayi8g,The_Milk_Man_09,0,Fri Jul 18 04:05:33 2014 UTC,"Oh, I didn't know about that particular benefit, I'd never heard of it talked about that way.

I don't necessarily like the formality of ground rules. I liked a post from a few weeks ago about the new vacuums at the Shell on Stadium. I know that station, but I still had no idea what the person was talking about. Then I went behind the station and was like, ""Ohhhhhhhh.""  So, not necessarily a ground rule, but what I'd like is something that requires a closer or out of the way look to find.  Cryptic clues are the best. Mine for this: This place used to be something else. I guess that works for Rupert's too, but it's not Rupert's!"

I used it to exercise.  I customized it the way I wanted it.  After market seat, bontrager road tires, front and rear LED lights, underseat storage pouch.  I called the police right away.  Filed a report with the serial number of the bike and everything.  People just suck man.

Footing the bill? they neither paid for the pads, baskets , benches, or landscaping to create the course at all. We even had gotten funding to put in cement pads that obviously will not be installed.  I don't think asking to just empty garbage cans and perhaps add a few more or mow more then twice a season is asking too much for such a boost in potential revenue.  We could have fixed this if they didn't ignore communication attempts for quite some time.    aptly named buddy."

It can be hard to tell what kind of landlord one will be, but sometimes multiple house landlords are not bad, it's not an end all be all rule.  Just something that is a general trend.  Also this area can be noisy at night.  in the fall a lot of college students will be around and they tend to party a lot because they realize their parents can't tell them to go to bed.  There's also a chance that a shitty band will live in a house near yours and you'll have to hear them practice a few times a week.  When you're looking at a house, it never hurts to knock on a few neighbors doors and ask them what that area is like and if there are any problems they've had with neighbors.  good luck dood"

Edit: Although the policy was rescinded, Judge Willis (of the same family) implemented a policy where adoption would only be allowed by the court if the potential adopted parent would be a full-time stay-at-home parent for one year, and not work full-time until the child reached kindergarten. This family is all fucked up and full of extremism."

kzoo,29qy0s,spice_taster,1 point,Fri Jul 4 09:18:00 2014 UTC,"Well, we don't actually know if Willis Law is on the right side of the law. The Supreme Court decision was narrowly enough tailored that it is unclear whether what the Willises are attempting would be legal. That first must be tested in court.  Secondly, whether you have a right to do something is no commentary on that thing's moral status. The Supreme Court has held time and time again that people have the right to engage in hate speech. That does not mean, though, that hate speech is anything but morally repugnant, or that those who engage in it do not deserve to be shamed and ostracized.  Obviously the Supreme Court disagrees with my opinion here, but I believe freedom of religion should be like my freedom to punch you in the face - I'm free to swing, but I am not free to interfere with your right not to get punched in the face. The Willis family should be free to exercise their religion as far as they want to, so long as they do not interfere with anybody else's right to freely exercise their own religion, or lack thereof.  I believe what the Willis Law firm is doing here is morally repugnant, possible illegal, pigheaded, and absolutely deserving of shame."

kzoo,29kxt3,bbqturtle,-2,Tue Jul 1 20:33:13 2014 UTC,"My bills are paid, but I work anyway.  My bills are paid, but I work anyway. The days by interacting with lights, the nights by interacting with darkness.  There is a window in my office. The fluffly clouds stroll by, waving hello as the sun walks across the sky. The light from the window falls gently on my keyboard as I type this, as I stare into a million more suns and earn the money I need to pay for more light. 5:00PM. Nobody is here anyway. Time to head home.  My bills are paid, but I work anyway. The days by interacting with lights, the nights by interacting with darkness.  The road home is a lifetime, the sun streaming into my face. I bat the sun away with visors, hands, and eyelashes. No amount of polarization can shape the sunlight into something that will speed up the journey. The door opens and shuts as the sun begins to hit the horizon. The dinner waits precooked in the freezer, knowing its fate. Restlessly I check sites and eat. Make sure life is in order. Encourage my body to keep moving. Pass the time until the quick and dull sunset. I don't even see it with the thousand suns imprinting my eyes.  My bills are paid, but I work anyway. The days by interacting with lights, the nights by interacting with darkness.  Just as the windy night blows the gentle misting of a humid days air away into nothingness. The cars are slower. The streets more clear. A coldness falls. And yet, vibrancy grows. Each light has meaning in an otherwise dark world. Even the pavement under my car is that of a living road, which laments the beating it took during the day, ready to share its warmth with any soul to reach down and feel it's touch, but none pass by. It feels lonely. Its low light is not vibrant, is not meaningful, does not matter. But it is there.  My bills are paid, but I work anyway. The days by interacting with lights, the nights by interacting with darkness.  Four prominent stars is all the cityscape will afford. But I don't notice. The only stars I see are the LEDs burning into my unblinking, weary eyes. Millions of stars, moving and shaking, and two watering eyes. The night time, in its beauty, slips away as the darkness gives way to new lights. 1AM. 2AM. 3AM. And finally my eyes give up. However, as my eyelids weaken, the lights continue, having left an impression in eyes and thoughts, leaving no room for enjoyment.  My bills are paid, but I work anyway. The days by interacting with lights, the nights by interacting with darkness.  The starscape finally dwindles from four million stars to just four. Those four stars lie waiting, streaming onto Kalamazoo, praying that someone will look up. Calling so loudly that the pillow and foam is not enough to keep me from waking. Stepping outside, I first look left and right, and finally up. I see the stars, so bright and alert, bathing the cityscape with a dull glow. Each one is named, and each one matters. I bend to sit on the pavement, expecting coldness but receiving warmth. The pavement smiles and warms me gently as it too finds the four stars.  In a world with so much light, there are few that appreciate the darkness. In a world with so much darkness, there are few that appreciate the light.  My spot is where light meets darkness, where warmth meets coldness, and where awake meets asleep. In a life with too few hours, and so many lights, do not forget to interact with darkness.  My bills are paid, but I work anyway."

Because if you're hanging out with people in their twenties outside of campus areas, you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who doesn't identify as anarcho-whatever.  My guess is that you're sticking to campus areas (students don't seem to have well-developed ideologies) or the suburbs (Portage != Kalamazoo) if you can't find liberals."

kzoo,29ikwc,Duckfloss,2,Thu Jul 3 23:58:01 2014 UTC,Great. Could you give me some pointers. I'd love to know where the liberals hang out or any events they may attend. I work a lot so that keeps me busy but I'll make time.
kzoo,29ikwc,elcheeserpuff,3,Sun Jul 6 04:59:13 2014 UTC,"I have kids so that definitely colors what things we are able to do in our free time. But you can definitely find lefty types at anything with ""people"" in the name (such as People's Church and People's Food Co-op). The ACLU holds a film series hosted at Saffron every summer. The Peace Center on WMU's campus frequently has events (and frankly 90% of the stuff on either campus over there tends to be pretty progressive).  I guess it really depends on what you want to do. Are you just looking to socialize? Do you want to do something overtly political? Are you interested in artsy cultural stuff?  My best advice in any case would be to check the bulletin boards at either Water Street Coffee Joint or People's Food Co-op. They're both always filled with lefty-type events.  Is that at all helpful? Feel free to PM if you have questions."

kzoo,29ikwc,BrandonCarlson,5,Wed Jul 16 01:15:28 2014 UTC,"I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that you're not trolling.  Just because someone isn't politically like minded, doesn't mean they're bad people. Try getting to know people past their political opinions. Saying you're going to move to a more liberal area is the wrong solution to the problem. Assuming that someone isn't worth talking to because they are conservative is a pretty closed minded way to live.  That being said, I have no idea how you haven't met liberal minded people in Kalamazoo. We are ALL over. Try going to the farmers market, coffee shops (Black Owl is pretty cool), or the food co-op.  Don't view yourself as trapped anywhere. Your surroundings are what you make of them.  ... all that being said, portage is the most conservative place I've ever been to. It's painful."
kzoo,29ikwc,UnderwaterStar,0,Tue Jul 1 01:04:39 2014 UTC,I never said that someone who has different views are bad people. Jeez really???? I have many family members and friends who are republican or have no political interest at all. My only point was that it would be nice to have one or two people to talk to that share my values and morals and views of the world. I am just tired of always arguing and never ever hearing someone agree with me. It's frustrating.
kzoo,29ikwc,cbsteven,2,Sun Jul 6 05:18:21 2014 UTC,"You need to stop taking things so personally and offensively. That's your problem. Not that there aren't enough democrats around you. Stop looking for someone to agree with you and start wondering why no one agrees with you. Consider that instead of everything around you being the problem, that you are the problem instead.  I really hope that you learn to be more open when it comes to other people's opinions and that you discover how to look inward instead of externally when it comes to change."
kzoo,29ikwc,ZeGreatFonduta,0,Sun Jul 6 20:11:47 2014 UTC,Whats so wrong with wanting just one person in my life I can talk to about issues without it becoming world war 3?

However, he does make a fucking delicious Italian beef - get it with giardiniera peppers.  E: I used to live on Harvard just down the road from Ray Ray's, and ate there with great frequency.  If he had cheesesteak on top of his hot dogs, Italian beef, grilled chicken, burgers, ribs, and pulled pork (which are all great - try the MJ burger) I would have 100% moved in to that restaurant and never left."

Any money we've asked for has been to contribute to getting pizza or something like that.  And we actually don't play either really, we play Project M, which is a really awesome Brawl mod that balances everyone and makes it a little faster like Melee. Although we do often have a Melee setup for those who wish to play it. We had two Project M setups and a Melee setup last night.  Overall it's just for fun more than for glory so far, most of us are casual and bad, aside from 2-4 of us that are actually somewhat skilled and perhaps tournament worthy."
kzoo,28rakx,Deeeeeve,3,Sun Jun 22 00:50:42 2014 UTC,"Where would I go to get info on the next one?  Would it be on smashboards, some Facebook page, or maybe this subreddit? Really interested in participating!"
kzoo,28rakx,IndigoHero,2,Sun Jun 22 10:49:24 2014 UTC,We actually have a group here on Facebook! It's open and you should just be able to join it. Let me know if you have any issues!
kzoo,28rakx,LinkKzoo,3,Sun Jun 22 19:06:19 2014 UTC,"Please post when the next one is, I'd love to come!  I've never played Project M, but it sounds amazing."
kzoo,28rakx,Paul_Lawl,3,Sun Jun 22 11:32:44 2014 UTC,"Project M is fantastic; we all love it. We have a couple people who prefer Melee or Brawl, but the vast consensus is Project M. I will definitely post on here a day or so before the next one, but feel free to join our Facebook group where we will also post information!"
kzoo,28rakx,xilva65,3,Sun Jun 22 19:08:39 2014 UTC,"Please do keep us posted about future meet-ups. I'd like to check it out, but unfortunately the next month and a half will be pretty busy for me.

kzoo,28rakx,slightlyintoxicated1,2,Sun Jun 22 23:59:24 2014 UTC,"Most of us are in the 20-23 range, we had a (I believe) 17 year old last time, who absolutely wrecked everyone except for the winner. He was incredible.   But for the most part none of us are really ""good"" except in a casual sense. We want to have fun with it. Hell, I haven't won a single game yet through 4 tournaments."

kzoo,28nodd,Gandhi_of_War,3,Fri Jun 20 18:59:36 2014 UTC,I think that depends on your bartender at Shakespeare's or how busy it is. I've had a couple bartenders give us dirty looks and stop coming to our end of the bar because we like complicated drinks.

I've gone when it's slower and the bartenders are more interested with their phones than serving. They do have a decent patio....If you can get a seat

Harvey's is best on Mondays for the 2 dollar u-call it's   Shakes usually has something on special but the bar tenders know how to make a lot of crazy drinks but can be pricey but honestly I don't think I have ever felt gyped

Fort Custer is a state park so that would seem to apply to it. State forests are a little different and have what is called dispersed camping.    Hope that helps!"
kzoo,28jszp,dispatchgeek,1 point,Thu Jun 19 18:57:23 2014 UTC,"I don't think you can do ""dispersed camping"" because I believe this statement says that since Fort Custer is a designated campground, you can't go anywhere, unless it's a mile away.    you are more than one mile from a designated State Forest Campground"
kzoo,28jszp,nnnnnnnnnnm,1 point,Thu Jun 19 19:27:40 2014 UTC,"Fort Custer is awesome. It is indeed ""sites only"" and the DNR patrols often.   Back when I was 23, I was camping there with two friends. We were exhausted from biking all day, causally sitting around the fire around 8pm, even making a conscious effort to keep quiet... when the DNR swung in to our site and performed a full shakedown, going as far as to go into our tents and through our bags in search of alcohol, which they made us pour out. Booze is NOT allowed in the park. I felt like a young kid at a college party being broken up by the cops. Embarrassing. I would have gladly packed it up and left it in the car for the night.  One bad experience aside, the park is great - and the trails can't be beat."

kzoo,286eqr,jamalstevens,1 point,Mon Jun 16 06:53:52 2014 UTC,It was annual Global reddit meetup day. It's a yearly reddit tradition.  Couldn't exactly change what day it was on.

This meetup was a specifically for Annual Global Reddit Meetup Day.  It's a Reddit wide event.  All the local sub-reddits (like /r/kzoo, or /r/atlanta etc. ) meetup someplace in person on June 14th.  This was the 5th one."

Charter is your better option at $30 for 30mbps if you bundle and ~$40 if you don't, depending on specials. Plus, I have it on good authority charter is going to double their speeds soon and keep prices the same."

These guys are great (within the confines of an ISP) which is backed up by this little tool by netflix http://ispspeedindex.netflix.com/usa Anywho, lately (about two months) they have been incredibly spotty because as u/mygoodfriendbaxter says they are in the middle of a massive upgrade. But as the service stands now I get a testspeed of about 17 mbs down, and 3mb up. So it might fit the bill for you."
kzoo,284s5z,cluisarts,2,Sat Jun 14 21:37:25 2014 UTC,"Charter pretty much sucks, but not nearly as much as Comcast. At least funding Charter means there's one less dollar going to Comcast or AT&T...until Charter gets bought out anyway. :("
kzoo,284s5z,johnnygoober,1 point,Sun Jun 15 02:13:59 2014 UTC,"Thanks for all the discussion guys. To reiterate I specifically am looking for Comcast KNOWING that their service is less reliable because they have 10 Mbps or higher up - meaning upload speed, not download. The upload speed is what is important for streaming. Charter is capped at 4 Mbps in Kalmazoo."

kzoo,27nk54,platoreborn,2,Tue Jun 10 11:16:20 2014 UTC,Get an underwater housing for your camera and shoot them in the deep end of a YMCA swimming pool.  Hot air balloon photo shoot?  Gilmore car museum or Rent the banana car.  Maybe the hidden Kalamazoo tour people could get you into some lesser available areas.
kzoo,27nk54,abigwethen,1 point,Tue Jun 10 21:26:36 2014 UTC,thanks those are some really cool ideas and I have the equipment to shoot underwater already. Some action shots coming off the diving board would be crazy at the WMU pool.

Also Carrie McFerrin is great.  The Globe, below Shakespeare ' s has great artists/ stuff to do.   If you're into college-y type stuff the west side has Y - Bar, The Library and The Hookah Lounge and frat parties 24/7. Downtown has the Wild Bull too.  Monaco is fun there's dueling pianos and you can pay to have a song played the talent there is phenomenal.    The Strut has music and is a coffee bar.  411/Metro one half gay bar other half awesome shows/music. I was there a few weeks ago for the Kalamazoo Academy of Rock or something like that it was awesome a bunch of 8 year olds rocking to awolnation etc..

I personally would suggest you dont hang out at the block party. You deserve better for yourself then that superficial shit show and this is coming from someone who opened and worked for monaco bay / wild bull *for context i left on very amicable terms,  tbh that scene is atrocious.  Papa petes has great live music 3-4x a week, the state has some great shows lined up, the union has amazing preformers usually western students,  Fire is very dope, boomerangs is ""ok""  louies trophy house has a pretty solid standup comedy night.  bells is, well bells. Old Dog is nice cause you can play pingpong for shots, both venues have great live music.  much to do and thats just the ""bar"" scene."

kzoo,26ngck,azreal64,2,Thu May 29 19:07:33 2014 UTC,"The medical school isn't part of the main campus. In fact, the medical school is a private medical school that associated with WMU - not something that's under it."
kzoo,26ngck,tellme_areyoufree,1 point,Wed May 28 17:54:55 2014 UTC,"Yes, that's my point. It's off campus being financed with a large cash donation that WMU received a year or so ago...and it's being placed off campus.   WMU has started to get their act together recently with the construction of new Sangren Hall and the new residence hall, but up until that main campus was an eye-sore when compared to off-site campuses like Parkview and the Health/Human Services campus.   It still is in ways when you have such a stark gap between the 1950's residence halls and the newly completed education building. I just wish WMU would have put that donation money into programs and construction on main campus, rather than off it."
kzoo,26ngck,azreal64,3,Wed May 28 19:45:32 2014 UTC,"Yes, that's my point   I'm not sure it is. I don't think you understand.   It's off campus being financed with a large cash donation that WMU received a year or so ago...and it's being placed off campus.   WMU did not receive a $100million donation. The medical school did. The medical school is not WMU. The medical school is a PRIVATE medical school which collaboratively associates with Western Michigan, Bronson, and Borgess. The medical school is not owned by Western Michigan University. There is no in-state vs out of state tuition. It's a private medical school.   off campus   Because it's a private school, the medical school's campus is it's own campus. Saying it's ""off campus"" is meaningless. It has its own campus, the Upjohn Campus, which it is on.   (stuff about WMU construction)   All of that stuff is meaningless (for the purpose of this conversation) and unassociated with the medical school."
kzoo,26ngck,tellme_areyoufree,1 point,Thu May 29 04:32:50 2014 UTC,"It's also worth mentioning that the medical school building isn't new construction -- it was donated. IIRC, it was an old Pfizer/Upjohn office.  It's been renovated to become the new med school."

kzoo,26ngck,nnnnnnnnnnm,1 point,Mon Jun 9 18:28:48 2014 UTC,"Maybe from the outside it is, but I'm talking about the internal appearance of WMU so to speak. Buildings like Rood Hall are falling apart and need a total re-build, some buildings aren't even being used (due to the presence of asbestos, apparently), and all the meanwhile, the residence halls, most of which are ~60 years old, have been largely neglected over the years and fall way behind when compared to those of the other major schools that WMU competes with.   Granted, WMU has made some strides to fix this in recent years with the finishing of new Sangren and beginning of the new residence hall, I still wish they would have invested more money into main campus, rather than this medical school. By the time the university finishes its ""30-Year Plan"" to re-build or renovate every major building on campus, they'll have an odd mix of totally new and very old buildings on campus and will have to start over again because new Sangren will look like old Sangren did a few years ago.  tl;dr Spend more money on main campus, not on shiny new off campus projects"

kzoo,26nncq,Anti_Venom02,3,Wed May 28 02:49:36 2014 UTC,"""Wild bull/Monaco bay/district square""- These places are a lot of fun, but its not really a ""Beer scene"" Also, Shakesperes knows how to get down, its right next to bells."
kzoo,26nncq,cluisarts,3,Thu May 29 19:11:23 2014 UTC,"I would suggest starting out at the beer exchange, get a couple of great, reasonably priced beers in your guts, maybe some starchy food as a barrier to the beating your are going to get booze wise later. Someone is going to try to buy you shots at this point...you might want to pass on that. Two pints of high caliber beer is more than enough to get you moving. Wander over to Bell's, get yourself another large beer and sit outside, take a little time with this one cause you are about to get serious. Also no liquor at bells so, you might end up with an extra beer here. Now from there, its the fast way down the slide. You hit Old Dog Tavern across the street, shots with friends. Then wobble over to Shakes, they are used to seeing young people wasted and will do their best to funnel you into an area where you won't hurt yourself or anyone else. Also extra bathrooms all around...just incase. IF you make it out of there and still want some more...or can't tell the difference, head on over to Green Top. The folks that run the joint are like everyone's grand parents and will prolly see that you recover some before finding your way home. If you aren't totally destroyed at this point, and feel peckish, (and it is the weekend) head over to the Crow's Nest on westnedge and sober up. All in all these are all in walking distance and fairly drunk friendly. Good luck! And happy b day."
kzoo,26nncq,eratoast,2,Thu May 29 21:00:17 2014 UTC,"Definitely Beer Exchange--tons of options, great good. If you or someone else tells the bartender that it's your 21st, they may crash the market for you. I'm also a big fan of Monaco Bay."
kzoo,26nncq,stankyschub,2,Thu May 29 22:53:48 2014 UTC,The Pilsner Club. Its the first floor of Waldos. Its my favorite. Its laidback and nice selection
kzoo,26nncq,skm001,2,Fri May 30 02:25:15 2014 UTC,"Start out with Shakes (good food, great beers and drinks), then Bells, then Beer Exchange and maybe head on over to the entertainment district. My friends and I do this route on our bar crawls and it always ends up being a blast!"

kzoo,26m23z,ghoti023,2,Tue May 27 15:36:20 2014 UTC,"I live right around the corner. I always say that the neighborhood is not that bad, but then something like this happens. Very disappointing."

There's a lovely little farmer's market near downtown on Tues & Sat mornings. In addition to Bells, there are plenty of other fun breweries, and bars like the Old Dog Tavern or O'Duffy's. Who Hit John is a fantastic band. Downtown Kzoo does an Art Hop the 1st Friday of every month, which are great, but most of the ""festivals"" at Arcadia Plaza are more opportunities to pay to enter, pay to drink, pay to eat, then go back home. Only worth it if you know/love the band that's playing or go with a large group of friends."

Why should ISPs even care what sites YOU access?  Why should it matter if you watch YouTube or some dude's crappy videos off his server?  To an ISP, it's bandwidth.  You've already paid for it, but now they are going to charge on the other end.  Netflix is already paying some ISPs, which means Netflix customers are footing the bill.    I'm a network admin for one of the larger institutions in Kzoo.  And we've invested a ton in OUR infrastructure over the years.  ISPs refuse to because they would rather collect the profits.    This is a real shame because everyone that isn't a large corporation loses when NN goes away."

kzoo,262g9b,bigbear75,1 point,Wed May 21 00:45:56 2014 UTC,It's okay to be awful. Disc golf is chill by nature. If someone's behind you trying to get through let them play through. Its a no pressure kind of game
kzoo,262g9b,ElBeartoe,1 point,Wed May 21 01:32:04 2014 UTC,"Don't worry about ""awfulness"", every body starts somewhere. I myself am also into disc gold in the Kalamazoo/Portage area. Air Zoo is one of my favorite places to go because it is relatively short and open, a nice outdoor activity that doesn't take all day.   One of my favorite things is seeing families on the course. Sure they slow down the pace a little, but seeing kids taking up the sport (especially considering it is an outdoor activity) is absolutely fantastic."

I usually play with my sister from another mother, so she wont feel out of place, and the females locally are really into the scene I could hook her up with the girls who run a league out in coldbrook if she was interested in all female play.  in the event that you dig it I could also recommend and or offer you a few decent starter discs to purchase and direct you in what else you may want in your bag and what to look for as you progress in terms of ability and power.  lemme know Amateur world championships is next year, perhaps you will get so into it you will want to take a shot at am3 play ;) lol."

Bell's sells growlers of beer they don't normally package. If going the growler route I would get it from there since they have a nice filler that purges and seals the growler. Other places don't and the beer inside will oxidize fairly quickly if you don't drink it right away. If looking for out of town/michigan beer you can never go wrong with Founders."

If you're bringing growlers I might suggest Boatyard. They aren't bottling yet but make some great brews.   If you are looking for Michigan beers, not just kzoo, I would suggest Perrin as a great little-known place. The grapefruit IPA is pretty amazing for a light refreshing summer brew.   Edit: if->of."

kzoo,25syo9,crzytimes,1 point,Thu May 29 16:42:58 2014 UTC,Well...I guess that would be a conversation starter....lol Wouldn't bother me though.  At least I got that sucker out for drinks.
kzoo,25syo9,crzytimes,1 point,Thu May 29 16:55:06 2014 UTC,You frequent Shakes. Are you heading to IPA day today?
kzoo,25syo9,HundRetter,1 point,Thu May 29 17:00:05 2014 UTC,"I've been to Shakes a couple times now.  Was a bit drunk there last Friday night before trekking down to Louie's.  I may or may not make it there tonight.   Will definitely be in the area though!  Just moved back to K'zoo a few months back.  Haven't hit up all the bars yet.  Still trying to find ""my home""."
kzoo,25syo9,crzytimes,1 point,Thu May 29 17:09:50 2014 UTC,Shakes is dead :/
kzoo,25syo9,HundRetter,1 point,Fri May 30 03:56:59 2014 UTC,When is frequent at Shakes? My work crew and I hit the karaoke nights pretty often.
kzoo,25syo9,crzytimes,3,Sun Jun 1 09:38:31 2014 UTC,I've probably heard you. Randomly at least once a week i am there. Tues thru Friday. I prefer to not go so much on Thursdays... Crowd is a bit younger.
kzoo,25syo9,HundRetter,1 point,Sun Jun 1 10:22:27 2014 UTC,Sorry in advanced if you have heard us. It's a spectacle to say the least. I usually pop in Sunday and Wednesdays. I can't say I've ever stopped in on a Thursday.
kzoo,25syo9,crzytimes,1 point,Mon Jun 2 06:06:31 2014 UTC,If I head down that way on Wednesday I'll send u a PM. Haha
kzoo,25syo9,crzytimes,1 point,Mon Jun 2 08:26:41 2014 UTC,"For sure! I'm hard to miss. Small lady, lots of dog tattoos, blonde mohawk."
kzoo,25syo9,HundRetter,1 point,Mon Jun 2 08:59:28 2014 UTC,Cool cool. I've seen my fair share of karaoke disasters. I spent the better part of the last 4 years in Korea mostly watching sometimes participating in making fools of ourselves. Good times.  I'm more of a Barfly. Thundercats tattoo would be my distinguishing mark.
kzoo,25syo9,crzytimes,1 point,Mon Jun 2 10:10:26 2014 UTC,U at shakes now?
kzoo,25syo9,HundRetter,1 point,Thu Jun 12 04:35:25 2014 UTC,"Shoot, I didn't see this! I was at Shake's last night too!"
kzoo,25syo9,crzytimes,1 point,Fri Jun 13 05:24:47 2014 UTC,"Hahaha Well I saw a chick with a blonde mohawk and a bunch of tattoo's (didn't pay attention to the type of tattoo's....i was a bit intoxicated) at  Shake's last night, but she said she never heard of reddit.  So I think someone might be playing a game on me, or I got the wrong person."
kzoo,25syo9,banksnld,1 point,Fri Jun 13 07:08:20 2014 UTC,Ha! Did you talk to the OTHER girl there with tattoos and a crazy spiked mohawk with green in it? I saw her as well.
kzoo,25syo9,HundRetter,1 point,Fri Jun 13 07:34:37 2014 UTC,hahaha  I probably did.
kzoo,25syo9,banksnld,3,Fri Jun 13 07:46:38 2014 UTC,We're two weeks out from GRMD 2014 - can we get a decision on the location so people can plan?
kzoo,25syo9,Roll3d6,2,Fri May 30 19:49:03 2014 UTC,"I'm obviously pushing for Alamo, but if it's decided earlier enough (like in the next few days) and the plan is to land at Alamo I'd like to be able to arrange a little something in the lobby."
kzoo,25syo9,HundRetter,3,Sun Jun 1 09:37:46 2014 UTC,I'm hoping for Alamo myself.
kzoo,25syo9,banksnld,7,Sun Jun 1 17:35:28 2014 UTC,Alamo?  Just a thought
kzoo,25syo9,Pargsnip,5,Sun May 18 04:07:44 2014 UTC,"We would absolutely love it. The underage kids can come, loads of beer and full bar, food, etc. We can seat at least 150. We have been trying to get people to hang in the lobby with out going to a movie.   Also I would totally be the bartender that night. I'm weird, we love weird shit, come on in."
kzoo,25syo9,blackngold518,5,Sun May 18 06:45:52 2014 UTC,That could possibly work.  It's downtown so easy to get to other places...
kzoo,25syo9,Pargsnip,3,Sun May 18 17:29:17 2014 UTC,That's got my vote.
kzoo,25syo9,blackngold518,6,Wed May 28 11:51:31 2014 UTC,"I think a bar is appropriate for lubricating the conversation of a collection of introverts.  And also for getting drunk!  Edit: Actually, I rescind that.  A BYOB BBQ or something similar would be even better.  Cheaper, more accessible for young'uns, etc."
kzoo,25syo9,banksnld,2,Sat May 24 05:50:02 2014 UTC,"It sounds like a great idea, but organizing a bbq is alot of work... It requires people to bring food and coordinate grilling and all that jazz.  It just seems like it'd turn into a cluster before it got all sorted out.  And since we have no idea who is ACTUALLY going to come, it makes it all the more difficult to plan!"
kzoo,25syo9,blackngold518,1 point,Tue Jun 3 11:50:09 2014 UTC,"Looks like 3 for the bbq idea. If weather is nice, we can do it starting at like 1 and just chill during the day and move to the bars in the evening?"
kzoo,25syo9,jhoiz,1 point,Thu May 29 17:53:44 2014 UTC,"That sounds like a really good idea.  Maybe one of the parks that's near downtown then?  Nice and central, and then Bells and le Alamo and Tibbs and Gonzo's etc. are all nearby."
kzoo,25syo9,jhoiz,2,Sat May 31 19:13:36 2014 UTC,What about milham?
kzoo,25syo9,cbsteven,2,Sat May 31 20:29:37 2014 UTC,"Bell's is only all ages until 8 PM, and the last one at Bell's ran later than that.  I really think Alamo would be a better option this time, especially since one of our own would be working the bar there."
kzoo,25syo9,cbsteven,2,Wed Jun 4 18:46:27 2014 UTC,"Yeah, and we had a good time at bell's.  Alamo is great but doesn't have any outdoor seating and at it's core it's a movie theater.  I think we should just stick with bell's initially and we can move to Alamo after that if people want to stay out later."
kzoo,25syo9,fatkidwithcake,4,Thu Jun 5 13:28:41 2014 UTC,"I think a meet up in the park would be a better idea. I know a bar sounds awesome but there could easily be redditors in this area who aren't 21. A cookout that's byob would allow the under aged ones join and we could still have a few drinks. Plus, with byob, you're not limited to the selection of the bar."
kzoo,25syo9,PHAHTROX,3,Sat May 17 23:18:07 2014 UTC,I suppose that is the point of the thread...  See if there is a call for a non age-restricted venue.

kzoo,24ybvm,tootNA,1 point,Wed May 7 14:34:08 2014 UTC,Any hardwood forest is your best place to start.  The older (large and thick shadow giving trees) provide the best conditions.

The bus was an hour and twenty minutes behind schedule, I nearly missed my connection.  If the choice is between the $17 greyhound and the $23 Amtrak, I would take Amtrak.  Edit: Greyhound has WiFi now, but the connection is slow and imgur is blocked.  Amtrak is a better choice if you'll be browsing reddit."

I've gotten screwed several times by Amtrak's crappy schedule; the train out of Kalamazoo is regularly--REGULARLY-- an hour late, and I've missed flights because of it.  Again, the Greyhound leaves on time; depending on which one you take, it will only stop once or not at all."

kzoo,24490g,notChuckFinnley,1 point,Sun Apr 27 21:08:49 2014 UTC,I think if you go to central city (last I was there located on rose st by museum near the parking garage) they should be able to look it up by plate. I think after 7 days fine increases
kzoo,242jnz,persamedia,1 point,Sun Apr 27 00:50:33 2014 UTC,I was wondering if you could start showing the episode around 9? I have a house meeting tomorrow I need to attend from 8 to 830ish. It's ok if you prefer to start at 8 though.
kzoo,242jnz,captaincupcake234,2,Sun Apr 27 02:39:19 2014 UTC,I can definitely try..  Though isn't the episode only released at a certain times?

kzoo,23yyov,tiburtius,2,Fri Apr 25 19:07:02 2014 UTC,"This is probably the best idea. I'm not super familiar with the parks here yet, since I moved here just last July and haven't ventured into them, but the one at Kilgore and Lovers would probably be ideal imo. We could start another thread, get it stickied and then people can sign up for what they would like to bring to the meetup?"
kzoo,23yyov,blackngold518,0,Fri Apr 25 19:29:48 2014 UTC,We could honestly probably have it on Western's campus. That way people that don't have cars can find someway to commute there. Or there's a disc golf course up by W Main and 9th that has picnic tables and such.
kzoo,23yyov,tiburtius,2,Sat Apr 26 14:48:00 2014 UTC,Bell's Brewery's Beer garden might be a nice spot.  Arcadia Park might be another decent spot.  I also think Rupert's Brew House might be open to hosting a reddit event.
kzoo,23yyov,entropyofmind,1 point,Sat Apr 26 02:43:22 2014 UTC,what about bronson park or milham like previously mentioned (even though it's technically portage)
kzoo,23yyov,HeaComeDaJudge,1 point,Sat Apr 26 12:13:21 2014 UTC,Milham isn't technically Portage - it's still Kalamazoo there.  It's even right across the street from Loy Norrix.
kzoo,23yyov,banksnld,5,Fri May 2 13:06:36 2014 UTC,Milham Park?
kzoo,23yyov,MistaMuns,2,Sat Apr 26 03:01:20 2014 UTC,I feel like this or Asylum Lake would suffice because of the amount of open space we would have available!

kzoo,23yyov,banksnld,2,Sat Apr 26 02:10:55 2014 UTC,"In regards to the idea of having it at a park, I'd like to suggest Blanche Hull Park as a possibility.  It's right up the road from Milham Park, doesn't get super busy, and doesn't get the duck poop that Milham gets everywhere.  If Portage parks are an option, Romona Park is pretty nice."

I also saw a dripper with a tank setup that looked really awesome. You screw a little dial and it lets a drop out to hit the coil so you get the best of both worlds. I did hear the flavors were slightly muted due to the distance between mouthpiece and coil and it cooled the vape but I still want to try it.

Also Cottage Inn has great pizza, and of course you can't forget Erbellis... though they are a bit on the pricey side."
kzoo,23stkr,J973,2,Thu Apr 24 13:24:48 2014 UTC,"As far as ""fast food"" pizza goes, Jet's is totally the best. I'd pick them over Pizza Hut or Little Caesars every day.  I'll have to try Cottage Inn and Bimbos sometime."

I suggest zeroing in on the Vine neighborhood."

Great kitchens in these restaurants, too. Public transportation here runs from approx. 7am-930pm.  But if your apt and job are close together, walking or riding a bike wouldn't suck. Good Luck whatever you choose!"

kzoo,23stkr,littlebugs,0,Sat Apr 26 10:31:16 2014 UTC,"First thing: Public transportation is sketchy at best. Buses run at half hour intervals at peak times, and usually at one hour intervals. I don't recommend using it unless you have no other option.   In terms of finding a job: I guess it's possible but it won't be easy. Kalamazoo is home to Western Michigan University and Kalamazoo College, as well as a number of public and private high schools. All of these students also take up jobs in addition to the many other people looking for jobs.   I'm afraid I can't suggest places, but I wouldn't recommend Kalamazoo."

I'm hesitant to say anything because it's already a smallish place and I hate overcrowded gyms, but it's good and has a lot of amenities. Plenty of machines and a healthy free weight collection. They've got showers, saunas, hot tubs and a pool. I pay 25 a month but I know people who've gotten in cheaper.  I think they're still doing a free 7 day pass deal.   Swat off of 9th street is a bigger place and costs more but it's open to the public this week.   I've heard nothing but garbage about Beyond Strength or whatever it's called."

Bell's is nice during the day, when the weather is nice and you can go to the beer garden.  They are the biggest brewer in town and have the most national reach.  The cafe has beers that no one outside of the kalamazoo area has had a chance to try.  I've never had a great time at Bell's during peak evening hours.  Too crowded, hard to find space, or get a drink  Boatyard is my favorite place, it's a few plastic tables in an old rail warehouse on the north side of town.  Taps rotate freuqently, but they're only open Friday and Saturday right now (as of my last visit). You sit amongst the brewing equipment, there's some quiet music, but mostly its easy to get a beer and talk to folks.  Gonzo's combines food and beer the best, it is a more traditional restaurant type place with waiters and the whole shebang...  uh oh, gotta go, sorry to cut this short"

kzoo,22w30x,johnnygoober,-5,Sun Apr 13 11:03:23 2014 UTC,"I'm interested to hear about more eyewitness accounts, especially from anyone who was physically at the scene, near the police when this happened. I've heard accounts from a couple of people who were there, claiming that the police were recklessly pepper spraying people sitting on the ground, not even taking part in anything violent.  Perhaps most importantly, I was also informed that the situation with people trying to overturn the ice cream truck happened AFTER the police were on the scene and started intervening.  I have no idea if this is true or not, but I'd like to try to hear from as many people as possible to get a better picture of the true sequence of events. Obviously, if the most violent acts of aggression were happening after the police arrived, it changes the overall picture of the whole event.   The general overview I was getting from those present was that the vast majority of people weren't behaving violently, and that it was a small minority that perhaps provoked the police response. Obviously, the greater majority were definitely trashing the streets and causing a huge mess, which is entirely a bad thing and very much illegal, but using tear gas in such a situation seems not only overkill but also incredibly dangerous.  If you or someone you know was there and saw the events go down, and especially if you know someone injured, I'd really like to hear from them. Send me an email, or message me here.

kzoo,22w30x,Jabrono,1 point,Sun Apr 13 17:38:30 2014 UTC,So how much of that story is true?
kzoo,22w30x,hosea0220,2,Sun Apr 13 20:16:21 2014 UTC,"The police followed us around all morning and were very cool about everything...if fights broke out, they stopped them, but let the rest of us do our thing. They were just trying to keep it under control. When we got to the 4th house, there were an INSANE amount of people. The cops told us to move on to the next house, and people started throwing glass bottles and rocks at them. That's when the police made the decision to call in the riot squad.  Tear gas really, really sucks."
kzoo,22w30x,scooterbub,-4,Sun Apr 13 20:34:29 2014 UTC,"No one tried to overturn an ice cream truck. My drunk friend jumped on top of it (being an idiot obviously) and then the driver took off. End of incident. But what can you expect when you take your ice cream truck into a group of 2000 drunk students...   No one was being violent that I saw (besides a couple stupid fights), but I got hit directly with a tear gas canister and burned by it. It was not needed and the police did not give us warning or adequate notice for that. I've been to CedarFest numerous times at MSU and the police have never acted like that."
kzoo,22w30x,innerpigdog,2,Sun Apr 13 21:26:24 2014 UTC,"They were saying things on the car PA's. The party might have been too loud to hear, but there were warnings.   Like you said, with a group of 2000 drunk students things can be expected. People were climbing onto houses and bending gutters, and bottles/cans were being thrown. The locations that the crowd went to were trashed after. Chairs and other things were being stolen from peoples yards. Your friend was on the ice cream truck, I saw it drive off while he was still on it and fall. He's lucky he didn't get hurt. It was out of hand and not an appropriate location for that many people.   I think it was completely justified. I was there, I got hit with the gas, but I'm not upset about it. The police were just doing their job and trying to not let things get more out of hand. Google CedarFest and the first pictures you see are of police in riot gear and teargas."
kzoo,22w30x,BruceMclane,-1,Sun Apr 13 23:43:25 2014 UTC,I was at every Cedar Fest. The kids were actually out of control there and were using physical force against the police officers. Their force was justified. Kalamazoo PD did not have a reasoning for using that force.
