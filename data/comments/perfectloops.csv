perfectloops,3dyln1,Kanthes,39,Mon Jul 20 18:00:31 2015 UTC,Any sooner and the throwing apparatus wouldn't be ready for the new ball yet!
perfectloops,3dyln1,yooman,13,Mon Jul 20 18:37:44 2015 UTC,Also any sooner and you risk the ball not being settled in the cup causing a misfire (you can see the ball rattle and bounce a little in the cup after being caught).

perfectloops,3dyln1,kumiosh,22,Mon Jul 20 18:43:13 2015 UTC,Not as pointless as the unplugger or the machine that turns itself off  This one at least takes a great deal of computing effort to be pointless :)
