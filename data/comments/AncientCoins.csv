According to Crawford, the reverse ""Combining a togate figure on one hand with an eagle and the fasces on the other hand, perhaps simply alludes to civilian and military imperium; taken with the obverse type the reference is doubtless to the Spanish command of L. Postumius Albinus""(Crawford, RRC p. 389). The L. Postumius Albinus referenced was an ancestor of this moneyer who was praetor in 180 BC and given the province of Hispania Ulterior and after conquering two of the tribes there triumphed in 178 BC before being elected consul in 173 BC.  Oh, and since I know it will come up: the reason for the serrations is not known.

Issuing serrated denarii as proof that the coins were solid silver to your newly occupied regions of the Mediterranean makes as much sense as anything else I've read about denarii serrati.    If you don't mind me asking, was this a coin shop buy or an online auction? The prices for these seem to vary from ~$150 to ~$1000. I'd have a hard time knowing if I was overpaying once it gets up that high. Hopefully you got a bargain! :-)"
AncientCoins,3e5t6y,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:19:16 2015 UTC,"This was an auction buy. I buy from both auctions and coin dealers but I always shop around a bit, research auction prices(via acsearch.info) and when it comes to dealers I will usually ask them to go down on the price a bit if I think it's too high(though i always offer a fair price, lowballing will almost never work). Republican denarii prices do go all over the place. I didn't get a steal on this one by any means but I paid a pretty average price at $130 + fees. That reminds me, always remember to take auction fees into account(usually 10-15%) when you see a coin that sold for X amount at auction and you're trying to come up with a good amount to offer a dealer."
AncientCoins,3e5t6y,Nikodeimos,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:25:41 2015 UTC,"That is an amazing coin. Ship it to me for a minor buff-up. =-}  I favor four theories, all of them, for the reasoning behind putting the serration in the edge...  1  The Seleucids were a major powerhouse empire of the eastern Med. region, and they serrated their coins. It was common for a newbie power to mimic coins of respected empires, to gain more respect for their coinage.  serrated seleucid coins ---> http://www.google.com/search?q=seleucid+serrated+coin&btnG=Search&hl=en&gbv=1&tbm=isch  2  People would take several coins, shave off silver (chiselers) from the rim, and then multiply their money by stealing silver. The serrations show the coin hasn't been shaved. This was done right into modern times when coins were made of precious metals, for this very reason.   3 Just as the author of the web page you reference has noted, it is hard to make a fake fourree that has these serrations in it.   4  People used to ""hack"" the silver coins with a knife to prove it was silver through-and-through, rather than a plated fake. So these serrations are pre-hacked. You find these hack marks on ancient Greek and Seleucid coins.  So these rim hack serrations make the coin more respectable and acceptable. This did involve a lot of labor. Once the empire became powerful and inflation reduced the value of these coins, it wasn't worth the labor to do this.   Once an empire or kingdom gains respect for its coinage in its own right, then you see the coins of that empire take on its own unique style and there is less slavish mimicry of coinage from other empires.  And the fasces has a long and interesting history. It started with the Etruscans (pre-Roman rule), and there is very little writing from that time (it's kind of a dark period), but the bundle of rods was an Etruscan symbol of right to rule. It is adopted by the Romans, and the symbolism assigned to it by the Romans is that the bundle represents that many rods that hold together create strength through unity.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasces  The Romans started out their empire with some conquest, but also tried using the Greek technique of trying to create a league of allied kingdoms. They tried to get subservient colonies to willfully band together with them to make a league similar to the Greek Delian League. The league was not of equal partners, though, and it was expected that members of the league would show subservience to  the main leader, and pay yearly tribute (tax). It was sort of a protection racket, you paid your heavy dues of the league, and those dues were used to ""protect"" you from invasion by the people collecting the tribute.   Greek rule by league ---> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_the_Delian_League  This didn't work in Iberia, and there were many rebellions. Actually the attempts to rule by league were pretty much a failure everywhere, and in the year of 81 B.C. the Romans invaded Iberia and forced rule by fiat and total occupation. No more attempt of cooperative rule, they were conquered by force.  I wonder what those dots on the lips of Hispania are about?  Very nice coin."
AncientCoins,3e5t6y,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Wed Jul 22 13:17:01 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with nr. 1. It seems highly unlikely to me the Romans made these serrated denarii to mimic Seleucid serrated bronzes. They might've taken inspiration or the technology from the Seleucids of course, but Republican denarii never really played a big role in the East (Syria, etc. where Seleucid coins mainly circulated), nor were the Seleucid bronzes meant as international trade currency, so copying them for prestige purposes was pretty pointless. I agree with 2, 3 & 4, though.  I also think it's a bit of an exaggeration to call Rome a 'newbie power' in the early first century BC. Maybe in the Eastern Mediterranean, but even then, everyone there was quite aware of just how powerful Rome was."
AncientCoins,3e5t6y,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Wed Jul 22 14:29:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, by 80 B.C. Rome was no longer newbie, but then that is about the time you see the serrations disappear and there is a style change towards what we consider the imperial, real Roman style. I think the serrations start in the 2nd century BC, when Rome is a minor player, and Rome envies Greece and it's offshoot empires, like the Seleucid.  Another point that makes me think this is mimicry is notice the serifs used on the coins of the republic, they are the ""dot"" style of the Seleucids. And the art style is Greco-Seleucid. They are definitely mimicking Greek and Seleucid coins in other manners in the style of the coins of the Roman republic, so why not the serrations also? Why mimic so many features of Seleucid, and ignore this one?  I think Roman coins didn't actually reflect Roman culture until after the Republic. They are just copying coin styles, which is really typical."
AncientCoins,3e5t6y,Nikodeimos,2,Wed Jul 22 15:12:25 2015 UTC,"Here's a side-by-side comparison of early Roman and late Greek coins with serrations. One culture is mimicking the style of the other, and since Greece is the empire to envy at that time, it is most likely the Romans are mimicking the Greeks.  http://academic.sun.ac.za/antieke/coins/muntwerf/serrati.html?sa=X&ved=0CDwQ9QEwE2oVChMI56z8uIjvxgIVVimICh1OxAK2  Doing this is not uncommon. In later years other cultures go on to mimic Roman coins and the Roman style serifs, for the prestige it gives their coinage, and not because it is their native style."

AncientCoins,3e5t6y,Nikodeimos,1 point,Wed Jul 22 16:17:17 2015 UTC,"Crawford actually dismisses all of the theories about fourees and such entirely when discussing serrated denarii and concludes that it was simply a stylistic thing. His argument is based on the fact that serrated denarii were circulating at the same time as non-serrated denarii, so a forger could easily just choose to counterfeit the non-serrated ones and that the style and fabric of the serrated denarii and the few rare specimens of usually serrated issues without serrations or non-serrated issues with serrations as proof that they were made by the same workers in the same mints who occasionally got confused about whether an issue was serrate or not. Not sure how much I agree, but I thought it was interesting coming from the guy who literally wrote the book on Republican coinage."

In science we have a way of resolving these nebulous disputes by pulling out a compromise plan called ""multiple causation"". It means all the theories are right, until proven otherwise. It stops people from arguing needlessly and allows more than one possible explanation to exist.  It may not be ""true"", but it is a reasonable compromise in the face of the lack of convincing data."
AncientCoins,3e5t6y,Nikodeimos,1 point,Wed Jul 22 15:50:01 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty good point! Of course, Crawford could be wrong, but I'll admit I'm not the go to expert on the intricacies of Republican coinage. At any rate, the Seleucids used it on bronze coinage, so countering fourrées or shaving seems out of the question there.  I still don't see why Rome would mimic Seleucid coins for prestige purposes, however, especially around 100-80 BC when Seleucid power was entirely broken. Roman republican denarii in general didn't even circulate much in areas where the Seleucids had had prestige. For artistic purposes, however, hell, why not."

The legends on these coins were still in Persian and the coins themselves were still hand-struck.

I have gotten in pretty nice with two ancients dealers who sell so much that they don't have other jobs, ancients makes them enough money to fly to Europe to buy coins directly from sources.   My biggest case in point for this is last year I found 4 lifetime Alexander tets at a smaller dealer. The person was asking $800ish for each. I would've been interested in their coins if the starting price was in the $600s. Go over to one of my big time dealer friends and he has one for less than half the price. His wasn't in as good condition but it also wasn't straight up $450 less valuable, he just wanted to move stock."
AncientCoins,3dbyus,GeneralAgrippa,3,Wed Jul 15 05:57:32 2015 UTC,Exactly! I went in to a coin shop that is a little far from home- wanted to check it out. They wanted like$35 for a common Constantine- and tried to tell me it was traded graded. It was in one of those cheap plastic slabs by some ransoms random company that didn't even fully identify the coin let alone assign a grade...    EDIT: my phone is a terrible auto-corrector!

But that this place it had dark foam inside with the coin floating around in there. Completely average grade, common, constantine and like $35+ they wanted."
AncientCoins,3dbyus,jojo32,3,Wed Jul 15 18:25:43 2015 UTC,You should have offered that shop a few common Constantines of your own for $10 each. What a bargain!
AncientCoins,3dbyus,TenthGen,2,Wed Jul 15 19:57:42 2015 UTC,"lol, good idea!"
AncientCoins,3dbyus,jojo32,3,Wed Jul 15 20:30:37 2015 UTC,"dark foam inside with the coin floating around in there   I'd be suspicious of the chemical interaction of the foam with the coin. You might find that 10 years from now the black foam as turned to goo and attached itself to the coin, possibly eating the patina.  I suppose that putting a common ancient coin in a big case could be a good present for a very young child, because then they are less likely to lose it. I gave my son a big, common roman coin when he was 7, thinking that the size of it would make it hard to lose, but sure enough it went missing. He was very embarrassed about even to this day (more than 10 years later), and I have to keep telling him ""I didn't like that coin anyway"". =-}"
AncientCoins,3dbyus,antiquarian_bookworm,3,Thu Jul 16 12:19:31 2015 UTC,"Coin shows are great places to buy coins. Do your research, make a list, and definitely don't be afraid to haggle. I have never had a person NOT lower the price of something at a coin show. Especially if you have cash. Don't worry, it's very likely the dealers will still make money. Buy several things from one dealer and ask for deeper discounts. Never reach into a dealers case without permission. Don't be afraid to ask to see a coin. Any coin. Take your time. Have fun!!!"

I'm still not sure what kind of collection I want to start, I'm thinking I want to collect a specific emperor. I feel that might be the easiest place to start off. Are there any emperors in particular I should look out for?"
AncientCoins,3dbyus,Nikodeimos,3,Wed Jul 15 03:21:20 2015 UTC,"It all depends on budget and interest, of course. Antonine denarii of the second century in general aren't very expensive and Hadrian in particular has some interesting things going on on his coins (+ Hadrian's coins have some of the most beautiful portraits on Roman denarii).  Severan denarii are quite cheap too and rich with iconography, especially Severus' coinage. You might want to check out coins struck for the Severan empresses too (Iulia Domna, etc.)  For the rest of the third century, I think there's a few good options. Gordian III and Philip I still have antoniniani with a decent silver content and especially those of Philip I are interesting because he struck coins to commemorate the celebration of Rome's 1000th anniversary (lots of circus animals on the coins).  Two other options spring to mind: Gallienus and Postumus. Gallienus' coins are cheap, numerous, rich with iconography and history, ... Most aren't exactly artistic highlights, however. He struck an interesting (and cheap) series of antoniniani invoking the aid of the gods, and these coins usually feature this or that god's typical animal (for example a capricorn for Neptune) on the reverse. Postumus was a rather long-lived usurper in Gaul, whose coinage is, for the most part, of unusual quality for the middle of the third century. Its iconography is less varied, but he has some of the best portaits struck on Roman coins as a whole (and a kick ass beard to go with it).  Lastly, the bronze coinage of the House of Constantine in general is very cheap and there's some interesting things in there, like Constantine striking coins with Sol on it after his supposed conversion to Christianity.  As you can see, there's a lot to choose from, but I'm sure as you're browsing you'll see some things that immediately spark your interest. It's a bit like falling in love. With an 18 mm. metal disk."

AncientCoins,3d38gj,autowikibot,3,Mon Jul 13 04:29:27 2015 UTC,"Labarum:       The labarum (Greek: λάβαρον) was a vexillum (military standard) that displayed the ""Chi-Rho"" symbol ☧, a christogram formed from the first two Greek letters of the word ""Christ"" (Greek: ΧΡΙΣΤΟΣ, or Χριστός) — Chi (χ) and Rho (ρ).  It was first used by the Roman emperor Constantine I. Since the vexillum consisted of a flag suspended from the crossbar of a cross, it was ideally suited to symbolize the crucifixion of Christ.  Ancient sources draw an unambiguous distinction between the two terms ""labarum"" and ""Chi-Rho"", even though later usage sometimes regards the two as synonyms. The name labarum was applied both to the original standard used by Constantine the Great and to the many standards produced in imitation of it in the Late Antique world, and subsequently.

But that can't be, because it is identical in shape and spacing of the letters.  If the obverse stuck to the die, and the guy rotated the die 180 degrees, and tilted it then struck it again... seems like a long series of improbable events, but that is the only way I could see this happening.

Obverse side ---> http://i.imgur.com/D4VXIfj.jpg  This side is the obverse of the coin (the ""heads""). It is abbreviated. Each character that looks like a ""V"" is two characters combined and combining them is called a ligature. They are a special ligature that is holy, to represent a special designation. The letters are the arabic characters ""alif"" and ""lam"". So it says ""AL"", but in a special way that designates ""Allah"". So literally the coin says ""Allah Allah Allah Allah"". Allah is just a word for ""The God"". What it is supposed to represent is a common phrase used at that time that says ""Allah (God) is the only God, and there is no other God"".  Here's what is looks like in modern arabic, unabbreviated: لا اله الا الله وحده لا شرك له  You can see the special ligature characters that look like capital ""V"", or capital ""Y"".  Reverse side ---> http://i.imgur.com/dcTd4mV.jpg  The reverse of the coin is another common phrase at that time. It says ""Muhammad is the messenger of God"". The  top of the coin shows something that looks like a key, and that is the word ""Muhammad"". Here it is in modern arabic type -->  محمد If you copy and paste that arabic into a word processor, you can increase the size of it and see how it compares to your coin.

So in this case, a tetradrachma (a Greek-style coin) was made in the name of a Roman Emperor.   We'll need a more clear picture to be sure who is on the coin and what exactly it is, though.

So it might be Diocletian on the obverse, this coin...  http://www.tantaluscoins.com/coins/109283.php  EDIT: OPPPS!  ""end of roman rule in egypt""... don't know what I was thinking there last night. The roman rule didn't end, but they quit making this style tetradrachms shortly after this.  Sorry."
AncientCoins,3c95m8,kingandroid,5,Mon Jul 6 01:40:34 2015 UTC,"I've always got the least duds when ordering per-coin. Honestly most of what I got from Crusty Romans was unidentifiable, really low grade or very common late roman bronze(LRB). The best I've ordered was from Noble Roman Coins and that was still LRB but better condition and less duds."
AncientCoins,3c95m8,Red_Spork,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:46:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info, that's something I've been hearing as well. Have a couple of friends that ordered from them a year ago, and weren't overly impressed by the lot. Have seen a lot of threads about buys as well, but hardly anyone seems to follow through with updates which kind of sucks. That said, I realize most folks aren't going to broadcast where they are getting deals or may not post a good find.  My main issue is just the price. The coins shown don't look as dirty as the ones I'm already getting far cheaper as I ""think"" their prices will come out to around 2-3 per coin on the smallest lot. Would be nice if they would put roughly how many coins you can expect by weight... it's something I've seen asked a lot."
AncientCoins,3c95m8,Red_Spork,3,Mon Jul 6 14:27:35 2015 UTC,"I know on the lot I purchased they did list roughly how many coins to expect per 1/8 kg and it was fairly accurate. But these were all fairly heavily precleaned and almost all the ones I have ID'd so far I had ID'd before I started cleaning them. The rest have too little detail to ID fully and more than a few I was able to ID had serious corrosion/bronze disease problems. That's not to say I didn't get a few cool coins but for the price I paid for the lot I probably could have bought higher or equal grade examples of those few and still had enough money left over for a Severan or other common denarius so I definitely won't be buying again from them.   One thing to be aware of when buying uncleaned coins is that if you aren't pulling them out of the ground, you're getting coins that have been very heavily cherry picked by the time they get to you. Every middleman is going to pick out coins they think look promising and pretty much anything that isn't LRB or doesn't have serious problems(i.e. Infested with BD) is going to get precleaned, and these days most of the LRB is as well. What gets passed on are common coins and low grade coins. Occasionally very low grade examples of rarer coins will be found but again, they will be very low grade.   If you like the IDing part, unless you're really set on cleaning coins yourself, I'd recommend saving up a bit and buying a group lot in F-VF condition from Agora Auctions or CNG or a Vcoins dealer. These are generally a better value and many times they sell at prices where you could easily attribute and resell them for a small profit. I have sold quite a few coins this way and usually the buyer gets a better deal than paying retail prices and I get the ones I want from a lot for little or nothing."
AncientCoins,3c95m8,ghsgjgfngngf,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:10:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's about the same thing I've read and it makes sense once you know how most of these ""finds"" are actually found. I've learned rather quickly that people use the term uncleaned loosely in the world of ancients. I did notice a few of their listings had a rough estimate of coins a month or two ago, but those sold out and the new ones have nothing listed. They also aren't what I would personally consider crusty.    Once I actually start getting a decent collection together, I'm sure I'll turn to Vcoins or another site to pick up singles. Honestly, I just really like the cleaning and discovery aspect of it as I get to learn a bit as I uncover each coin. Always been into history and this time period in general as well, so it's a good fit.   I don't expect to get rich or even attempt to flip anything for awhile (know nothing of grading), but it's a lot of fun so far. Looking to learn more about types of patina and different types of wear next before trying to figure out the condition or put any kind of rough grade on my finds."
AncientCoins,3c95m8,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:51:29 2015 UTC,"If you don't enjoy the process of cleaning, it isn't worth it. Uncleaneds in good condition are much more expensive than normal bulk lots of 'un-uncleaned coins'. What you get are common Late Roman Bronzes that you couldn't sell if you wanted to. If you enjoy cleaning coin, by all means go for it but if you don't, uncleaned coins are a waste of your time and money, no matter where you buy them."
AncientCoins,3c95m8,TenthGen,4,Tue Jul 14 11:23:11 2015 UTC,"For small purchases under a kilogram bag, it is standard to buy them per coin.  The choice of by weight or by coin is irrelevant and shouldn't influence your decision. Here are things I look for:   can buy a small sample, to test the lot what region the coins come from are the pictures of the real lot that I will receive, or a stock photo of just ""some dirties""? what is the condition of the coins? Crusty, really dirty, or just dusty?   Those are the things that should guide your purchase, not the method of dividing up the coins.  To me, the fact they are sold by weight is no more important than the color of the bag they are going to put them in. It's totally irrelevant."

The dirty old coin man has been around as an advocate of cleaning old coins for a long time, sort of a crusader for antiquities, so to speak. He likes the antiquity and the coins and the history more than the money, in my opinion. I've ordered from him at least several times that I can remember.  Funny story...  My ""mail lady"" used to flirt with me when I would go out to check my mail box. One day I ordered some coins from ""Dirty Old Coins"" and the package arrived, boldly marked that way. I met her at the mailbox and she wouldn't look at me... handed me the package, and from that day on would pretend she couldn't see me. =-("
AncientCoins,3c17aa,antiquarian_bookworm,4,Fri Jul 3 20:58:49 2015 UTC,"I get a bit angry when a seller makes it so obvious that coins are in a package. Every time I've had a package get delayed by or opened by customs(including some medieval coins that were damaged by customs' opening of the package) it was because someone wrote ""ancient Roman coins"" or similar on them instead of something like ""numismatic tokens"", which seems to allow them to sail right through. Our mail lady also has a tendency to put mail in the wrong mailbox and so far I've always ended up getting the package sooner or later, but I wonder if I'd be so lucky if it was obvious that it was ancient coins."
AncientCoins,3c17aa,Red_Spork,2,Fri Jul 3 22:43:22 2015 UTC,"What puzzles me is that these dealers put ""COINS"" on the outside of the package at all. A coin is an easy item for a postal employee to pocket. It's like they have a sticker that says ""STEAL ME"".  I've only lost one package ever, and I actually suspect that the dealer never shipped it. So that says a lot for the reliability of the mail service."
AncientCoins,3c17aa,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Fri Jul 3 23:06:25 2015 UTC,"I usually ask sellers to write ""metal souvenir"" in the description. It worked well for me so far.  I've been sending hundreds of untracked envelopes worldwide (mostly to the US) from France and amazingly nothing ever gets lost, stolen, opened or taxed. It must help that I never fill out the custom form and choose the cheapest shipping method.  We're lucky to have such great postal services.

The best thing to do is order a few of this, and few of that, and sample the different offerings. He sells a lot not only on his site, but on ebay, so his stock turns over fairly often, meaning that his ""dirty balkan romans"" can change a couple times in a year.   I can't say there is a dirty dealer that is always a ""winner"" to order from. It's a gamble each time.

In our generation and earlier it was common for men to have a ""dirty coin"" to show off to friends or to have a ""dirty pen"" or other such ""dirty"" things. It was pretty much mandatory if you were in the service. Even as kids, we would get one of those coins the GIs had and pass it around. It was like pin-up girls, another item of my generation, only the coins were dirtier. Men who carried these items were called ""dirty old men"".  The coins weren't ancient, they were just dirty. Yeah, she knew what ""dirty coins"" were. =-(.   When I tell some of my men friends that I clean dirty coins, they mmediately assume they are old service coins.   And the vast majority of those ""dirty roman coins"" I referenced are fakes. They aren't really ancient. There were some rare greek coins that were pornographic, but they are very rare and highly forged. A lot of them are ""fantasy coins"", coins that never really ever existed.

In the late 60's and early 70's, the culture changed to make these things ""bad"" and ""evil"", so a lot of it was thrown away in embarrassment. You might be able to find some authentic antiques from that time, but most of them were slipped into the trash can as the times changed and the attitude about them changed.  There have been many big changes in american culture in the past half century, most of it for the good. But it seems people have become more prudish and overly obsessed with things like health and longevity.  Other things that were destroyed from my time was all the racist stuff. So that was a good thing. That also had become bad and evil, so you won't find very many real items from that time, because they were pitched out from embarrassment. When I was young we would often say things about each other's heritage that today could get you arrested for violation of civil liberties or hate crimes. In retrospect, it wasn't good what we did, but it was ""just joking"", like the dirty items I mention.   What will your children point out that you have done wrong? =-}"

Obverse: Male bust right(Genius Populi Romani), draped hair tied with band, and with sceptre over shoulder; above, G P R. Border of dots. Reverse: Sceptre with wreath, globe and rudder; on left, EX; on right, S C; below, CN LEN Q. Border of dots. Crawford 393/1a. Cornelia 54. Sydenham 752.  Research points to this denarius having been minted in 74 BC at an unknown Spanish mint to pay troops under Pompey Magnus and Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius who were fighting against the Roman and Iberian rebels lead by Quintus Sertorius in Hispania during what is now known as the Sertorian War. The revolt has its origins in the discontent of both the Iberian Lusitani tribe, wanting independence, and the Roman Proconsul Sertorius who, as a populist who had declared for Cinna, knew there was no place for him in Sulla's regime in Rome. The war is known for Sertorius's use of guerilla tactics and ran from 80 BC to 72 BC when Sertorius was assassinated by Marcus Perpenna Vento, a rival military leader who had been fighting in Hispania as well until, at the behest of his legions, he was forced to yield control to Sertorius. Unfortunately for Perpenna, though he could assassinate Sertorius, he was no replacement and Pompey was quickly able to subdue his legions and have him executed.  Some info on the particular issue itself(All taken from the description of Lot 3035 of The Pre-Long Beach Auction - Ancient and World Coins, June 2014): Here we follow Harlan's revised dating to 74 BC as opposed to Crawford's 76 BC for this issue (see M. Harlan, Roman Republican Moneyers and Their Coins, 81 BCE-64 BCE, 2012, pp. 83-91). The revised date is based on the slight down-dating of the terminus of the Roncofreddo hoard as evidenced by the Mesagne hoard, Cn. Lentulus' own cursus honorem which makes a date for this issue in 75 too early, and most importantly a letter from Pompey to the Senate in Rome requesting money to pay his troops. The letter from Pompey was recorded by Sallust (2.98), and was read before the Senate in January of 74. In it, Pompey states that he had already exhausted his own (considerable) personal resources and even gone into debt supporting his troops, yet they had only been paid for one year of service while they had already served for three. He threatened that if the Senate did not provide the necessary funds to pay his troops he would not only be unable to pursue the war against Sertorius, but that he would likely lose control of his legions and the war could be brought to Italy itself. With these dire warnings, the Senate found the money to pay Pompey's troops, authorizing Cn. Lentulus, ex senatus consulto, to strike the coins.  The year following this issue Cn. Lentulus struck an identical issue employing the same designs but with the unusual legend LENT CVR x FL, Curator denariorum flandorum. He did so because he was no longer quaestor with the responsibility of issuing coins to pay the troops, nor for that matter was he even a mint magistrate (thus the designation III VIR would not apply either), yet he was still responsible for making sure there was sufficient specie to finance military operations. We do not know if this title was official and had come from the Senate in Rome or if Lentulus merely invented the title to indicate his responsibility.

The characters on the coin should say G.P.R. and they are represented like this   http://i.imgur.com/HLfNpzM.jpg  The letter ""P"" looks like the archaic Latin ""P"", that isn't closed...  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet  So I think the engraver was using an archaic letter, and wasn't really familiar with the current latin alphabet of the time. Or was he trying to be ""classical"" with his inscription?  The letter ""R"" is a more modern Latin ""R"". No problem there.  But that ""G"" is a puzzler. Latin alphabet is derived from Etruscan and Greek alphabets, and neither one of them had the letter ""G"" as we know it. That letter was invented by a roman named Spurius Carvilius Ruga in 230 BC.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G  I'm pretty sure I've seen that upside-down hook shape before, so I looked through ancient phoenician alphabet and derivatives, and found nothing.  I'm not real familiar with Roman Republic coins, so I cruised around a bit and found some of this period that have a definite ""G"" on them, so the ""G"" was used on official roman coins at that time.  So that brings us to looking at the local area, of iberia. Here is paleohispanic...  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleohispanic_scripts  No match there either...  So here's my theory. The celator (engraver) is a local guy in iberia and he is not familiar with the new latin ""G"", so he either uses a local variant or makes one up from a combination of greco-iberian letter ""gamma"" and the paleohispanic alphabet.  Gamma has a bit of an unside-down fish hook to it ---> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Iberian_alphabet  Anyway, that is really curious and adds to the history of the coin.   Today's show was brought to you by the letter ""G"" and the word ""celator"". =-}  As a side note... I also found out that Claudius tried to introduce some new characters into latin about 50 BC AD, but they were not used much and dropped after his reign."
AncientCoins,3bpk8y,iSmokeGauloises,2,Wed Jul 1 22:42:19 2015 UTC,"That's interesting to think about. As far as I can tell, others of this type don't seem to have such an irregular 'G', however I have yet to find one that is a die match or even seems to have been from a die carved by the same celator and from what I've seen it seems that at least 6+ celators were making dies for Lentulus at this time. It's possible that the top bars are just flow lines though, it definitely isn't uncommon to get very pronounced ones near the edges especially in a case like this where the strike is a bit uneven(coin is much thicker on the edge near there than the opposite), and the bottom line could be a small flown line or die break, but it looks more like intentional. I'll have to dig out some old catalogs tomorrow and see if I can find a die match or even just a similar ""G"", this is too interesting to leave alone."
AncientCoins,3bpk8y,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:22:39 2015 UTC,"That character looks like the far eastern tamga of the Kushan, but that isn't possible.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:KushanTamgas.gif  I was thinking one or more of the upstrokes of that tophat on your letter ""G"" might be flow lines, but the fact it has a tophat at all doesn't seem to match any western character set I can find.  The iberians were influenced through trade with the phoenicians, greeks, and then romans. Their alphabet changed radically in the BC period, and the fast evolution seems to have made a mess out of the understanding of it. There were local variations, also, since the different celtic tribes were independent of each other.  Maybe you have an undocumented variant of the letter ""G""? =-}  I think this ""G"" is derived from paleo-iberian (paleohispanic), because of the complex stroke structure. The other two characters ""R"" and ""P"" are obviously derived from the greco-roman influence.  EDIT:  =-}  Ironically, somebody seems to have downclicked me to show their agreement with me that the tamgas are not a possibility because the culture was so far away. They agree, so I get downclicked. Funny how reddit works.  I posted the tamgas because they show the use of the tophat characters, which isn't seen in western characters. That is what makes this character so mysterious."

Spurius Carvilius Ruga had the advantage that he was running an elementary school, so his students spread the letter ""G"".

AncientCoins,3bpk8y,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Thu Jul 2 11:39:31 2015 UTC,"Notice that character is made from two ""C""s, one of them backwards. That makes it easy to learn.  In medieval times large numbers where represented by using the Etruscan characters mixed with roman characters for the lower numbers. When printing with movable characters started in the 16th century, the publishers of books started to use combinations of backwards characters to try to represent Etruscan characters, so what you see in 16th and 17th century books on the title page is this weird jumble of characters, some backwards, that try to mimic Etruscan characters to represent large numbers.  The publishers did not want to waste money on having type created for Etruscan characters.  EDIT:  And then in the mid 18th century people started to use the familiar ""M"" and ""D"" to represent large numbers. So what we think of as ancient roman numbers are not actually how they were used in ancient and medieval times.  For example, a document that used the number MCCCXXI (1321) would be an obvious forgery, because the use of ""M"" and sometimes ""C"" was not introduced until recently, in the past 300 years.

AncientCoins,3bpjp3,Heretic_Cata,3,Wed Jul 1 16:51:58 2015 UTC,"Very intresting coin ! I'm not an expert in these but i do love late medieval/early modern islamic coins. This is a bit beyond that area. There is something peculiar about this coin tho. That fleur-de-lis in the top part is rather odd. I have only seen that on late medieval coins from Ahmadnagar, put here and there on the arabic text: http://www.zeno.ru/showphoto.php?photo=121930 . Your coin however has a circular inscription around the main text. From what i have seen on zeno, none from Ahmadnagar have that. I tried to look for earlier coins minted in Ahmadnagar but i'm not sure how or where to look. Link to the late medieval Nizams of Ahmadnagar category: http://www.zeno.ru/showgallery.php?cat=3271 The circular inscription usually contains all the data needed to ID the coin, the mint name, the year, the ruler etc. And it's usually the part of the coin that gets worn down first - this is the reason coins like this are hard to ID. The central parts of the coin have standard declarations of faith which don't offer much help. Another candidate would be the Umayyads of Spain which used the fleur-de-lis-like symbol on their coins: http://www.zeno.ru/showphoto.php?photo=10276 . However i could not find any such examples of copper coins. Link to category: http://www.zeno.ru/showgallery.php?cat=1024 Yet another candidate are the crusader imitations of islamic coins which have some european iconography on them. Here is an example with 2 fleur-de-lis: http://www.zeno.ru/showphoto.php?photo=43511 But again, no such copper coins that i can see.

I have a Nero tetradrachm but for my 12 Caesars collection I would like them all to have the Latin names of each emperor.   I'm a big fan of any coin with the iconic SPQR on it but especially coins where the SPQR is either the only writing or set apart. I love my Trajan denarius but the SPQR seems like an afterthought coming at the end of a very long legend.  Judging from where other auctions ended for coins in the same-ish condition I would say around $75-85.

You might find it is already loose.
AncientCoins,3bjwcj,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:45:34 2015 UTC,"Washing soda is safer (made mine from baking soda), and what most people recommend compared to salt (chloride gas) and baking soda as its milder.  Yup, they even sell 9 volt kits although mine is homemade with help from radio shack. On that note, I'm thinking it could be the voltage if the battery is old. Can't find a date on it unfortunately as it's a new, but cheapo battery I had in a drawer."
AncientCoins,3bjwcj,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Mon Jun 29 22:09:15 2015 UTC,"That fact that the graphite electrode is bubbling means you are getting current flow, but it might not be going through the coin. Keep the clip to the coin out of the solution, because you might have current flowing from clip to graphite and not through the coin. When you finally get bubbling and the clip is out, then it is going through the coin."
AncientCoins,3bjwcj,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:25:59 2015 UTC,"That seems to have solved the issue with a few of the coins, but I still think the batteries are weak as the bubbles still aren't very strong. May be the solution as well, not sure how quickly it loses its charge and needs to be changed if it's not dirty.  I've watched a few under a magnifying glass, and it's interesting to say the least. Only had a significant change in one, and I pulled it as soon as I noticed a little detail. Will take the toothpicks to that one tomorrow when my eyes are fresh."
AncientCoins,3bjwcj,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Tue Jun 30 01:50:30 2015 UTC,"The solution is not likely the issue. Pure water is an insulator, and adding the calcium carbonate sodium bicarbonate creates ions that can carry the current. As the electrolysis continues, it adds even more current carriers which are metal salts. The reason to change it is when the solution contains too much of the residue of corroded crusty material. You should find that as the solution gets dirtier, the electrolysis goes faster. One good reason to use calcium carbonate sodium bicarbonate as the current carrier is because is goes slow enough that it won't run away from you. Salt solutions created by the electrolysis can sometimes start roaring too fast and you end up with damage.  I don't know if you have a meter, but an alkaline 9V battery is pretty well depleted when it drops down to about 8 or 7.5  volts with no load.  I use a CCS, a Constant Current Source. It's a supply that I can dial in a current, and the supply will vary the voltage to try to sustain that current level. The sypply will go up to 24 volts and down to 1 volt automatically to maintain whatever current I dial in. It is more predictable than a constant voltage source, since it is the current that does the electrolysis work, a specific level of current gives a specific amount of electrolysis action.  Sometimes what happens is that the crusty corrosion is hanging onto the coin and a jab with a wooden skewer knocks it off in chunks."
AncientCoins,3bjwcj,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:13:28 2015 UTC,"Good to know about the solution, and I think you're right on those batteries being shot. Just not enough voltage to get it done. I will get a meter tomorrow along with some new batteries, good to have a meter on hand anyway.   Not really upset about the slow going either, I stand there and watch as long as I don't see fumes lol. Just making sure I'm doing it right as it threw me off when nothing happened after the first few coins did very well."

Price increases what seems like exponentially as quality increases though since the majority of these are of such low grade. The reason for this is that they were way lower purity than other denarii at the time(think ~80% vs 95%+ purity) so they weren't hoarded much and many circulated to the point of no longer being recognizable.
AncientCoins,3bcmwi,serendipitybot,3,Sun Jun 28 00:53:08 2015 UTC,"It has always seemed a little interesting to me that there are so many around - maybe they weren't hoarded just because of the low silver content, but they also weren't demonetized with sufficient frequency to prevent their constant circulation and wear.

Curious about the condition on the very top one and a few on the second row.  Top one doesn't bubble anymore when cleaned with peroxide like the rest so I assume it's done? No dirt from scrubbing either. The metal seems ""flakey"" though, and that's something I haven't seen on other coins or any from this batch. Is this something to do with corrosion?  The second and third coins (from the left) on the 2nd row appear to have issues as well. One looks like it has extra metal around the nose area while the third is gouged around the face. I'm going to assume this is common, but again am curious about the causes, etc...  Have only put a bit of time into cleaning these so far. Basically Hydrogen Peroxide with scrubbing and toothpick scratching. Soaked in oil for a bit as well, but the peroxide seems to work better initially. Figure when they quit bubbling, I'll let the tougher ones sit in oil and start carefully picking/scraping on the others with wooden skewers and the like.

They never seem to be employed as symbols of - say - the Emperor's virility or genitive powers, for begetting baby emperors or for fathering a prosperous empire.  If that sort of symbolism IS expressed, I think it's usually with the appropriate Roman goddess and not some notable member visible under his clothes or in the surrounding scenery."
AncientCoins,3a4cmg,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:26:25 2015 UTC,"Whenever I see sexual content on fabulous coins, my ""fake-o-meter"" goes off. I'm not questioning this one, because I'm sure experts have checked this one out, but those are the types of coins that are popular to buy and popular to fake. Just saying...  And I got a bit downclicked one time for making sexual comments about a coin that had a goddess disrobing on it. I think some people misunderstood, and thought I was being demeaning or something, but people need to realize this was a different time and culture.  Also, I see this same misunderstanding of cultures in my personal experiences. I've worked with people from all over the world, and traveled 1/3 of the world, and people need to realize that just because somebody isn't following your cultural mores, doesn't always mean that they are ""bad"" people.  An example... I was at a party and we had a big dog there. A guy walked in with his wife and kids, screamed at us, called us all kinds of dirty names, and walked out. In his part of the world people don't have dogs in the house, and they are considered disgusting farm animals. Then there was more misunderstanding while people at the party trashed this guy.  When traveling or reading history remember we are only visitors and not there to make judgments and correct them. That makes traveling and history a lot more fun. It might really rankle some personal mores, but try to see through that and understand from their point of view, and just enjoy the difference.  Unless somebody is really getting hurt, then you can condemn if you see fit. =-}"
AncientCoins,3a4cmg,EvilCartyen,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:40:54 2015 UTC,"Would you agree that the comparative lack of phallic images on imperial coinage suggests that when some do appear it's something, if not wrong exactly, then at least incongruous?  That it is something that one doesn't usually see associated with the public persona of the emperor."
AncientCoins,3a4cmg,GeneralAgrippa,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:14:36 2015 UTC,I'm definitely surprised to see it on a roman coin.  But they were no prudes. I've heard that there are some pretty risque mosaics and drawings and writings on the walls of Pompeii.

AncientCoins,3a1f5w,antiquarian_bookworm,3,Tue Jun 16 14:47:51 2015 UTC,It wouldn't surprise me if it hadn't been touched for 25 years. It is from the J.S.

But when I pulled up the full image I just fell in love with the colors as they are.  It depends on the composition of the metal, but richness like that dark brown is a long time to achieve. Verdigris also darkens over the decades after cleaning, so people should take that into account when buying freshly cleaned bronze coins."

AncientCoins,39yvl2,Unsurprised,3,Mon Jun 15 22:22:25 2015 UTC,"It's the same as every harsh method. It destroys some coins, overcleans others, works well for some. Everyone looking for a magic bullet in coin cleaning sooner or later thinks of the ultrasonic cleaner. Many ancient coins are heavily patinated, i.e. they are not metal with a thin covering of patina but rather much of the metal has been transformed into patina. Remove this (by whatever method) and you have an overcleaned ex-coin."
AncientCoins,39yvl2,ghsgjgfngngf,2,Tue Jun 16 11:20:50 2015 UTC,"I used to have a ultrasound bath back when I worked in research, and I sometimes used it for fossils, but never tried it with coins.   The only thing that would worry me is the abrasion of the coin lying on the plastic. Sounds like you are also aware of this, because you are using the plastic rather than the stainless steel.  So as long as plastic is touching dirt, should be good. Don't let it get to the verdigris."
AncientCoins,39yvl2,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Mon Jun 15 23:31:34 2015 UTC,I've got a small piece of microfiber cloth that I lay in the bottom under the coins once most of the dirt is off. So far so good and a silver actually turned up in this batch. Nothing great but my only ancient silver to date. Late era and thin but silver and not wash or plated. Happy camper...
AncientCoins,39yvl2,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Tue Jun 16 02:11:59 2015 UTC,"I've only found a few pieces of solid silver before. A bunch of washed and fourree.  But I'm a bronze man, so that doesn't bother me.   The microfiber pad sounds good. It seems I used to use a sponge or something. That was 30 years ago... The thing to worry about is that the dirt comes off, gets under the coin, and then the vibrations start abrading the dirt into the verdigris. If the microfiber allows the dirt to fall through and get away from the coin, then that would be the right idea."

AncientCoins,39wzbn,Whizb4ng,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:33:42 2015 UTC,"Damn, that first one had me so confused I was about to give up on it. I didn't know who all the parties involved were, and it seemed to be like walking into the middle of a ""who done it"" movie...  But here's a quote from that first page that is the smoking gun from that affair, and easy for all to understand...   About Zurqieh - I have his e-mails trying to sell the tetradrachm dated about a week after he claims to have mailed the coin to me.   That happened in 2006, and it seems to be back-dealing by Zurqieh over a valuable coin. They were banned from vcoins for a while. I didn't know that.  The second instance you reference is from 2012, apparently when  Zurqieh delivered a package two months late. The transaction was only over a very small amount of money, so it's hard to believe that money was a motive for dishonestly in this case, given the consequences to  Zurqieh  if they got caught doing any more bad deals. This one I might forgive them for.  But that first one is a huge turn off to me. The only reason I haven't ordered from  Zurqieh  is that I usually buy low end uncleaned coins and I usually assume that an order within my own country is more of a safe bet, due to things getting lost in the mail. I came real close to clicking ""buy"" on their site many times, because I'm just wowed by whoever does their cleaning.  I had one instance of not receiving a package from a vcoins dealer, and I've never mentioned it before. I was buying onsie-twosie low end coins from an american dealer, and a package never arrived. I never notified the dealer, and never bought from them again. I was getting bad delivery from them, packages often arriving a month after purchase, arriving first class mail and post marked three weeks after purchase. I was sending personal checks, and he complained about that, and this might have been his method of ""revenge"", but I can't prove that. Piss on him, I won't accuse him, but no more sales for him.  Out of the many in-country coins I've bought, that was the only package that ""got lost"". I can't remember the time that an in-country package I sent or received ever ""got lost"", so that instance was very suspicious to me. The coins I ""bought"" disappeared of the guys site, but I never got them.  I occasionally buy a coin if it has something like an alphabet on it or some image that I can't find while cleaning.  I readily forgive for errors, but not for underhanded behavior."
AncientCoins,39wzbn,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Mon Jun 15 17:38:44 2015 UTC,"I think he's ok. I can sort of understand the Uranius Antoninus thing (I would like to say I would have done the right thing but I don't know) and he's been off Vcoins a while as punishment.   I wouldn't trust the more expensive marbles and other items but the coins and the cheap Egyptian junk is genuine as far as I can tell. But that's par for the course, you have to keep your eyes open everywhere, there are maybe 5 or 6 sellers on Vcoins that I'd trust implicitly."
AncientCoins,39wzbn,ghsgjgfngngf,2,Mon Jun 15 17:13:31 2015 UTC,I would be fine with the Uranius thing if he had refunded payment rather than accepted payment and informed the buyer that the coin had been sent.

That much money back then could buy several nice houses.  I was always adverse to evil, even as a little kid.

I'm sure if there was any problems with his authenticity or quality or delivery, then he would not have been there for this long.

It won't be the most convenient and will take some time, but with ancients patience is the key to getting good deals and getting really nice coins at good prices. I think if you sold over the course of a few months, buying ancients here and there as you sell other stuff, and were watching auctions/vcoins ""new"" listings and researching the whole time, you'd likely end up with a much nicer collection in the end than if you just took and traded it all to a dealer for a group of ancients.  Just my opinion but in my experience patience goes a VERY long way in collecting ancients, much moreso than US/world coins of similar value."
AncientCoins,39uz32,Red_Spork,3,Mon Jun 15 00:56:03 2015 UTC,"Just my opinion but in my experience patience goes a VERY long way in collecting ancients, much moreso than US/world coins of similar value.   Excellent point, and it's what I've found as well collecting ancients thus far.  I check Vcoins often and keep a fairly well-curated wish list on there.  My first thought was to see if there were dealers who appeared on the list often who also sold US and world coins, but no dice.  It's probably best if I do take a longer road with this.  Thanks for the advice!"
AncientCoins,39uz32,born_lever_puller,5,Mon Jun 15 03:06:47 2015 UTC,"To add to what /u/Red_Spork has already said, if you offer coins for sale on /r/Coins4Sale you can also mention in the listing that you would entertain offers to trade for the right ancient coins. You see WTS/WTT tags there all of the time, (""Want to sell/Want to trade""). If someone is interested you can negotiate from there. Otherwise take the cash offers and buy the ancients from a third party.  Good luck!"

This can be done the slower more natural way by leaving them by an open windowsill for several months and by dipping them in distilled water once a day (will often leave a more colorful tone). Or it can be done the quicker way by putting the coin in hydrogen peroxide."

AncientCoins,39nvfh,kingandroid,5,Sat Jun 13 02:31:49 2015 UTC,"I've never gotten ""redirtied"" coins from reputable dealers. I've seen very suspicious photos on ebay by private sellers.  Here's the problem... the crusty ones that nobody can see normally have corrosion that is deep and you have to get brutal on them most of the time, bringing it down to the copper, and the surfaces are rough. So, yo have the advantage that nobody has seen it or cherry picked it, but now you have an uphill battle to try to clean it properly. I don't suggest crusties for beginners.  The lots that say ""every coin is attributable!"" means that you can see through the small amount of dirt so well, that the lot has been cherry picked. But the upside is that they will normally be easy to clean with non-aggressive tools, not have to be stripped to the metal, and not so disappointing for beginners.  Why do you want to buy by weight? I don't see this as any better than buying by count.   Look for dealer who sell using real photos of the lot.  If a person is doing this under the belief they will get better coins cheap by cleaning, that always ends in disappointment and anger. Cleaning is done for the adventure of it, and if you break even, wow, that's a real plus.   And you have to learn to love all the coins you clean, because you will get some real clunkers.  With all those warnings, if you are still attracted to the adventure of being an amateur archaeologist and putting in the work to clean these coins and attribute them, then you are the ""right stuff""."
AncientCoins,39nvfh,antiquarian_bookworm,5,Sat Jun 13 11:17:07 2015 UTC,"Cleaning, waiting, etc... isn't an issue for me. I am patient with things like this as I've always collected and sold various things, so I'm used to cleaning and identifying. Attempting to put an ID on an old object is a fun for me as well, although I understand why others don't really dig that part of collecting.  Same goes for the discovery aspect. In other areas I've dabbled in (toys, antiques), I enjoy discovery, so personally I would much rather be the first one to clean it up instead of buying pre-cleaned. That would take the fun out of it from my perspective."
AncientCoins,39nvfh,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Sat Jun 13 15:08:36 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's how I see it. I'm kind of disappointed when a coin is too easy to identify. I want it to put up a fight. I still have coins from 5 years ago that I haven't fully attributed, and on a quiet day it is fun to take them out and see how much I can discover about it. Studying them often sends me down side dark alleys of history.  So, yeah, sounds like you have the right attitude to enjoy coin cleaning.  I also bottom feed for antiques and antiquities, and look for the over-looked items. Then I often fix them up, even when most people advise not to (antique ""experts""). I'm not concerned with the monetary value much, since I got it cheap and have no intention of selling. What's ironic is that a lot of the stuff I fix up, people offer to buy, but if I hadn't rescued the item, people would have thrown it away, so experts be damned, I'm rescuing history from the dumpster."

This one is Heraclius and Heraclius Constantine. I haven't determined the obverse undertype but the reverse has so little wear that you can easily see that it was originally minted in Nicomedia then restruck in Constantinople. Given the amount of detail on the reverse it seems strange that they'd restrike it but I'm sure they had their reasons."

AncientCoins,39dav0,ljp2706,3,Thu Jun 11 00:14:12 2015 UTC,"The black layer on your coins is dirt with high organic content that has made a layer over the green verdigris. That black will come off as you scrub, so don't get worried.  You can't get in too much trouble with just water and a toothbrush, so keep going. If green verdigris comes off with a gentle toothbrush, then it would have come off anyway after cleaning. Some copper verdigris is so dense it is like glass enamel, and other verdigris is weak and fluffy.   So keep going with the soak and scrub, I see no damage caused by anything you have done wrong so far.  I find that the outside dirt is porous and easy to remove, so at first I do soak and scrub every day. Then the dirt becomes more compact closer to the coin and daily scrubbing seems to have little effect, so I back off to more soaking and less scrubbing. Not that long soaking will make the dirt come off faster, but rather that it is a waste of time to scrub everyday.  Keep going, looks like you have a good batch of coins.  Exciting to see the features slowly exposed isn't it? Like unwrapping a present slowly over weeks or months. =-}"

AncientCoins,39dav0,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Thu Jun 11 20:25:46 2015 UTC,"OK, after 40 minutes of downloading I finally got a glimpse of coin 3. I have a slow connection.  The obverse is coming along just fine and has very nice detail. You have not over scrubbed that at all, still a lot of dirt needs to come off. The reverse might have an issue with verdigris migration where the copper salts are migrating away from the coin and creating a blob. That's a tricky problem for later. Keep cleaning that coin with toothbrush and see what is exposed. The light glaring on it doesn't allow me to see how good or bad it might be.  You're doing fine.   Another fairly safe technique for a beginner is to use a wooden tool to poke and scrape. Do this on the dirt only, and not on the verdigris yet! You take a wooden toothpick or skewer and you can either use the sharpened end, or you can make a tiny brush by biting off the tip and chewing the end to make a tiny brush. Then very carefully poke and stir at the dirty parts to loosen the dirt. Using this technique can accelerate the cleaning of the more stubborn parts to avoid having to soak and scrub the whole coin for so long. Sometimes there is just one little spot that is stubborn and trying to scrub the whole coin just for that one little spot is asking for trouble, of over scrubbing the already clean parts.  But you haven't over cleaned anything yet that I can see. I've only downloaded the first three coins, though.  In a lot of these coins like you have here, the fine detail of the coin has been preserved in the verdigris, so excessively wearing down the verdigris with harsh scrubbing can permanently remove features. But you haven't done that... yet. =-} People often do that when they use a stiff toothbrush over a long time or if they jump straight to a brass brush with a soft verdigris. They are in too much hurry.  DON'T PANIC! =-} (famous advice from 'Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"")"
AncientCoins,39dav0,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Thu Jun 11 14:22:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, I'll keep it up and let you know how it goes(Hopefully with smaller/less bright picture sizes next time!)."
AncientCoins,39dav0,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:29:35 2015 UTC,"So I made another album of two coins that I just received (out of eight) I have not begun cleaning them yet, I was wondering if I should clean them or leave them as is...it seems like they might be good candidates for that two-tone method I keep hearing about. If I should do the two tone method, is there a specific way to go about it?  Here's the link!  http://imgur.com/a/OiDvJ  Thanks"
AncientCoins,39dav0,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Mon Jun 15 22:00:43 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah! they are just fantastic!  They are 90% done. The obverses are both done, but the reverses need just a touch more. You need to first go look at coins of this type to find out what and where the features are. On the coin on the left there is some lettering at the top that needs exposing. On the coin on the right, there are four horses pulling a chariot, and the details need to be drawn out.  Work like this is why I designed the wooden coin vise.  http://www.reddit.com/r/AncientCoins/comments/2xadn7/simple_coin_vise_for_cleaning_dirties/  In that picture it shows me using an exacto, but don't use that! In that photo I'm working on a coin with serious ""red cancer"", and it is delicate and brutal work. You need a much more delicate tool.  You don't need the vise and you can use your hands, but if you do this a lot you will see the advantage of having a vise to hold the coin while you work on it.  So the idea is to gently remove that light brown corrosion/dirt on your coins. You always start out as gentle as possible, and get more aggressive if need be.   So one gentle tool is a white rubber eraser. The red erasers have an abrasive in them. The white ones are ""vinyl erasers"" or ""artist's erasers"" and they have no abrasive. Gentle wipe the high points you want to expose.   If you find the dirt doesn't yield, you can move on to either a red rubber eraser, or to a wooden tooth pick with the end chewed. Circular motions are best.  Those are already beautiful and just touching them up can expose more detail and give you practice on this technique."

AncientCoins,39dav0,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Wed Jun 17 22:52:00 2015 UTC,"Wow! Excellent coin. It says ""rare"" on that site that you linked to. Seems likely, because I've never seen it before.  Look at the coin on that site and you can see it is two tone cleaned. You can do that with this one, most likely. The reason I say ""most likely"" is because sometimes the ""dirt"" doesn't have the right consistency and adhesion to be a reliable backfield. You find that out as you attempt to clean it.  This one you should make a new thread about. I bet most people have never seen this one.  Did you see my previous post about weird stuff you find in dirty lots? Holed coins are common. Sometimes the hole is drilled, and sometimes you see a square hole likely made by a nail, and sometimes a ""U"" shaped hole from what I also think is a nail.  I see these objects are bits of archeology, so a hole in a coin doesn't bother me, it intrigues me. Some people are purely coin art and rarity collector, so they see the coin as ""spoiled"". It all depends on what you think these things are, a matter of perspective.  http://www.reddit.com/r/AncientCoins/comments/2z53mb/weird_stuff_from_cleaning_dirty_lots/"
AncientCoins,39dav0,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:04:00 2015 UTC,"Awesome! So right now I have the coin soaking in distilled water, should I continue with that and scrubbing it with a toothbrush? Or should I use a toothpick gradually on the spots that are darker, and should it still be in the DW? Pretty excited about this coin now!  The hole doesn't bother me! It's fascinating because it shows each coin has its own history."
AncientCoins,39dav0,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Thu Jun 18 00:42:10 2015 UTC,"Definitely stop scrubbing. You want to leave that ""stuff"" in the backfield, and start using a non-abrasive vinyl eraser. If that is too weak, then move to a pencil eraser. If that is too weak, then use a toothpick. You want to leave that nice green underlying patina on the highpoints."

Most tourists who buy ""ancient coins"" in other countries end up buying a tourist fake for large amounts of money. Then sometimes they go to a museum in that country, only to find that the replica coin they bought is sold in buckets at the door for one dollar. Or they post it here and insist it is real, because they bought it in an back alley of an ancient city. =-}  Tourists usually never see the real ancient coins. I've traveled all over historic places in europe and never seen them, only tourist fakes.  And in a lot of countries, be careful you don't break the antiquities laws. It is illegal to leave the country with some items unless you have a release for it, and you might end up being detained at the airport, miss your flight, get strip searched, and end up with a fine. In cases like that, you hope the coin or ""artifact"" you have is a fake, because that will set you free.   It's best to just have fun and maybe buy some tourist fakes.

The other system is 'al pezzo', which means every coin has to have a specific weight, like solidi that have to weigh about 4.48 g. or Attic tetradrachms that should weigh 17.20 g. Bronze coins were usually struck al marco, meaning the weight can vary a bit between pieces (especially taking wear into account)."

There is a type of corrosion that I call red cancer, and it forms in spots and bores deep holes beneath it. Not behaving like verdigris corrosion. I think that is what attacked his ear and the knee on the reverse. When you dig it out, a conical hole is usually left.  I don't know the stats of this specific coin for weight. Follis were usually made a bit sloppy in weight, and you need to get the data for specifically that mint at that time. Mint officials often would play around with the weights, to the point where the central government had to send soldiers out to force them to obey the standards. They were picky with silver and gold, but copper and tin were another story.  Now that the HADRI problem is solved, I totally approve of this."

Even after it is cured, humidity in the air can release small amounts of acid. This glue is common ""white glue"" or ""school glue"" that kids would eat in elementary school. Elmer's stuff. It used to be ""animal glue"" made from cow hooves, but it has been made from unpolymerized vinyl acetate for some decades now. And it tastes different. =-} It is much less toxic now.  There are some new breeds of PVA that have come out that are pH neutral, or slightly above neutral, and should be OK to use. Look in the Kraft section of the store for Elmer's Kraft Glue, pH neutral, ""safe for photos"". Still, I smell acetic coming off during the curing (vinegar smell), so if you use that, then wait three days before putting your coins in. after it cures, the pH buffering chemicals in the glue should ""get"" any acetic that attempts to come off.  This glue is approved by museums and the Library of Congress for non acid applications. Also remember you only need a wee bit to tack it down. The least you can use the better.  I just used self adhesive felt pads cut to size. That glue is a petroleum based glue that will outgas hydrocarbons, but not acids. It shouldn't be harmful to the coins, and after 5 years of exposure by dozens of coins from bronze to silver, I see no affects to the coins."

AncientCoins,38xdde,antiquarian_bookworm,3,Sun Jun 7 21:00:17 2015 UTC,"If you are looking for the ultimate in benign glues, you can look for what is called ""wheat paste glue"". It is literally wheat flour that has been boiled to make a paste. You can even make your own, and just google for it. It is used by some book rebinders. Wheat paste was what kids used in elementary school if they couldn't stop eating the Elmer's white glue. It came in a bottle with a brush. Nowadays is is probably also a polymer, though. You can only buy wheat paste glue at a specialty store, and so it is easier to make at home from flour. It's like making gravy.  There are a lot of petroleum based glues in tubes in the hardware section of some stores. I don't see any advantage of using the petroleum based glues over pH neutralized PVA, though. A lot of studies have been done over the PVAs, and the neutralized ones have been approved by leading antiquarian book binders. Some stick with the old wheat paste out of tradition and fear of new things, though. They want to wait 100 years to see the results of using it."

Note--I would only try this if DW doesn't work after a few months."
AncientCoins,38mru2,ghsgjgfngngf,6,Fri Jun 5 14:47:10 2015 UTC,"Too early to start with brutal electrolysis now, in my opinion. That is when all else fails. It strips down to the metal, and the first one might have some good patina on it yet. Sometimes it seems like you have a patina left on the coin after mild electrolysis, but the electron current has gone down to the metal, and undermined the patina, and often causes undesirable chemical changes in the chemistry of the patina. So, if there is any patina worth keeping, I avoid electrolysis. To me it is for total strip down, and sometimes I leave a bit of the electrolysis residue on the coin to add color.  I like to give my coins every opportunity to be gently cleaned, before hauling out the heavy guns. A often let them go for 6 months to a year.  Oh, and watch out for the use of stainless steel spoons. They often are a chromium alloy or plate, and the chromium comes out in solution, making the water and the ""fizzle"" coming off quite toxic. Don't hold your face over the bath, avoid breathing the vapors, dispose of the bath water carefully, and wash your hands several times.   I don't believe electrolysis causes any considerable pitting when done carefully. The thoroughness of the electrolysis cleaning exposes pits that might not have been seen with other cleaning methods, so it seems like it was caused by the electrolysis, but actually the pits were already there. Try using a new penny and then examining under a lens to see what I mean. A person could, of course, make some pitting by letting it run and coming back the next day to find just a stub of metal left. =-}  EDIT:  When I found out the hazards of using chromium utensils, I switched to using copper braid and other types of metals."

I agree, it's a mess.  But how are you going to stop people making small decisions (buying a coin from Syria slightly cheaper, but without a paper trail) which help fund genocide and atrocities in the region?  When I was in high school, we went over a theory called the Tyrrany of Small Decisions. No one wants pollution. No one wants clothes made by underpaid children. But we all pollute, and buy sweatshop clothes. It's just this one time, and it's hardly my buy making a difference, we tell ourselves.  But when millions of people make small decisions like that, well...."
AncientCoins,38bmwx,esnible,2,Wed Jun 3 06:57:05 2015 UTC,"Is ISIS actually looting and smuggling coins?  From what I have read and seen on video they are destroying artifacts, not selling them.  The CIA says ISIS has between 20-31.5 thousand fighters in Syria.  Syria is engaged in a 3-way civil war.  The United Nations reports there are 3 million Syrian refugees from this war who have made it out, and 6.5 million internally displaced within Syria.  Refugees often sell family heirlooms (wedding rings, gold, silver).  If I saw a Syrian antiquity for sale, my guess would be one of the 9.5 million refugees sold it from their family collection.  It is hard to believe a few thousand fighters, who prefer to destroy, have suddenly decided to become smugglers.  ISIS gets its money from oil and Mosul's central bank.  That said, I am not going to import Syrian antiquities.  I respect the MOUs.  But I don't think they will help.  If you have any relatives who made it out of, e.g. WW2 Germany by bribing a guard with a wedding ring, perhaps you will agree that the policy is not the best."

That city is under control of the Assad regime.  Regarding the actual eBay auctions shown in the story, a dealer friend of mine knows the eBay dealer.  The eBay dealer is based in Georgia (the US state, not the ex-Soviet one).  Apparently this dealer had these coins for over a year and they were part of a collection long before ISIS ever existed!  If the United States were ever in a civil war and I was trying to bribe a Canadian border guard with a roll of Morgan dollars I would be very frustrated if he told me there was no longer a market for them.  I wish we could find a way to help 9.5 million Syrians to defend themselves against 32k jihidis.  Perhaps this MOU will help, but I doubt it."

In all likelihood this ""emergency"" legislation will convert into an MOU or something similar once it gets to the point where the region has stabilized and there will be yet another source country for which US collectors' options are to pay inflated prices for pedigreed coins or to break the law.   As esnible pointed out, ISIS is making its money from selling oil, way more than antiquities would ever make it.

Julian was trying to make a point with a deliberate return to the pagan Rome of yore.

I was working over there and a guy I was working with walked in and threw me his big as. He said he was working in the garden over the weekend (Bristol) and he hit it with a trowel. He let me keep it. I was blown away. He said ""Those bloody romans, leaving their litter all over..."". He said he has pulled a lot out of his garden.  I find ancient bits of pottery all the time, but the idea of pulling ancient coins out of the ground always amazes me."

Most web sites drag my tiny phone line into lock-up.  EDIT:  In former posts I mentioned that the bronze coins I have mapped come from a local area of a few hundred miles of the minting source, but from my reading I have seen opinions from archaeologists that high denomination silver has long legs, and can cover much larger territory, so an eastern coin could find its way to england."

Anyway, heh, filling a Roman imperial set is most any ancient coin collector's first impulse similar to how a U.S. coin collector might start out with a penny book or a Morgan date set. And just as most penny books never fill that 1909S-VDB hole no one realistically expects to get one of each emperor. The fun, of course, is in seeing how far you can get.   Even if you had Bill Gates's budget you couldn't do it.

AncientCoins,37gqel,white_rabbit_object,3,Wed May 27 22:44:29 2015 UTC,"I did something similar, but it's got a bitch of a management interface (I just use various mongo clients to edit it; yes, I chose mongo.

Another nice feature it gives me is the ability to print, on-demand, my coin flip sheets. I specify which coins I want to print, usually after I update some fields/values, and I print only those flip sheets I need. Paper cutter, fold, and they fit perfectly into my 2x2 flips. We don't use mongo for our own data storage, but I wrote it all in PHP, and that's currently our lingua du jour.

AncientCoins,37gqel,pmstacker,1 point,Fri May 29 00:04:06 2015 UTC,"At a corporation I worked at, they used oracle ($$$$$$) and MSSQL ($$$$). I wrote a java app to suck the data from the databases, do a numerical analysis of it, and then generate plots and graphs of data tends. So it wasn't web based. I used gimp in quiet mode to render the computations into graphics, and then the java app wrote a whole web site onto the client's drive. You could cruise through it with your browser. It was pretty cool because I don't need to mount a web server on the main DB server, but the user ended up with what seemed to be a web site. The IT department was blown away by that. When people in the company saw me using it to analyze status, everybody wanted a copy. It spread like wildfire across the company.  I taught java and web programming at a local 2 year college. I took some old clunker computers and set up a server cluster. I used windows 2000, redhat, BSD, and debian, with a mandriva computer as my local cluster controller. I put LAMP and Tomcat on the linux and unix. Then I had my programming student write java client and server side apps to mimic commercial web sites, like amazon. The web programming students used mySQL and LAMP and php to accomplish the same thing, server side, with javascript on the client side.  The windows server kept getting attacked and choking and dying, and I couldn't keep up with the security updates, so I dropped that server after a while. I found the linux and unix easier to administer, anyway. Never was a big fan of windows for reliability applications."

AncientCoins,37eyul,batwing97,8,Wed May 27 03:23:14 2015 UTC,"For me the answer is ""never*"". Grading just doesn't cut it for ancients, there are so many variables that even with NGC's system of wear, strike, surface and a star for good style it only captures a small portion of what I look for when buying an ancient, and so many sellers think that they can price slabbed ancients based on others of similar numerical value but really eye appeal is king. On top of that, the premium seems a bit ridiculous to me. I've seen plenty of coins where I could easily get the coin raw for 50%-60% asking price of a slabbed example.  * I would get a coin slabbed if selling it AND the buyer wanted it slabbed and was willing to pay for it."
AncientCoins,37eyul,Red_Spork,6,Wed May 27 03:47:30 2015 UTC,"Personally, never. I need to be able to hold my coins. As for authenticity, I am friends with enough dealers, many who sell ancients for a livelihood and are more than willing to look at my coins and who are more than willing to tell someone when they have a fake."
AncientCoins,37eyul,GeneralAgrippa,4,Wed May 27 04:40:12 2015 UTC,"I didn't even mention this but its probably my biggest reason. I really, really like to hold and feel my coins as well. I also like to examine them under the microscope when I get new ones in(for bronze disease, authenticity, curiosity) and slabs make this very difficult."
AncientCoins,37eyul,Red_Spork,3,Wed May 27 06:36:37 2015 UTC,Yes... must... hold.... coin...  8-O (zombie emoticon)  If they are locked away then it takes all the fun out of having the coin.
AncientCoins,37eyul,antiquarian_bookworm,5,Wed May 27 11:28:33 2015 UTC,But how can I make physical love to my coins if they are in a box?
AncientCoins,37eyul,EvilCartyen,2,Wed May 27 06:33:48 2015 UTC,I think this is my favorite reason too!
AncientCoins,37eyul,ghsgjgfngngf,5,Wed May 27 13:45:45 2015 UTC,"Never. AU isn't even a grade for ancients. You shouldn't need to pay someone else to tell you that your coin is: Strike 3/5, Surface 4/5."
AncientCoins,37eyul,antiquarian_bookworm,3,Wed May 27 09:35:26 2015 UTC,"I can already see the condition of the coin so I really put no added value to somebody else's opinion.  Having an expert certify that it is real has a value to me, but that would be done with expensive coins and I'm a low end bronze collector, so I don't worry about it.  EDIT: I should add something important... In ancient coins there are many patinas and styles of cleaning that can make a coin more or less attractive to different people, so attempting to put a ""grade"" on it is like trying to tell people what type of ice cream tastes the best. I like two tone cleaning method, and I put a premium on that style, but I've heard that most grading services will not even grade a coin that is a ""dirty clean"". I don't put much value on ""perfection"", so our opinions of a nice looking coin are diametrically opposed.  It seems to make sense for collectors of modern coins, but seems illogical for most ancients. With moderns, they are grading how close it is to the perfect example from the mint, but with ancients people are looking at the overall beauty of the coin, which is a subjective judgment call."
AncientCoins,37eyul,ghsgjgfngngf,4,Wed May 27 11:33:01 2015 UTC,"As much as I urge every collector to learn how to authenticate coins themselves, there is a limit to this. But the certification of an expert (which I agree is useful and often necessary) usually comes before the purchase. You buy the coins (at least those you don't feel comfortable authenticating yourself) from expert dealers, which makes them automatically certified by that dealer. This requires being able to tell if a dealer is an expert, which seems to be very hard for many collectors.  So sending coins in to NGC might be useful for people buing coins they don't know anything about on Ebay and then paying to have them authenticated. That's a stupid way to go about collecting and doesn't even save them money, which is the only reason to buy coins on Ebay."
AncientCoins,37eyul,antiquarian_bookworm,3,Wed May 27 12:24:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, for buying I rely on the reputation of the dealer as my insurance that it is real. A private individual who is attempting to sell a coin themselves would find that an expensive certified coin would be easier to sell on the open market if it was slabbed. Sort of a cost of doing business. You have to see it as a ""value added"" cost. For the inexpensive coins it isn't worth the cost. Look at the ratio to determine if it is worth it.  People selling on a forum site with open feedback have more security of authenticity than on ebay, which is really something like ""Barter Town"" from the Mad Max movie."
AncientCoins,37eyul,ikkiyikki,2,Wed May 27 12:45:58 2015 UTC,"The vast majority of ancient coin collectors consider a slabbed coin a turn-off. However, there's no denying that the cost of slabbing is usually recovered either because a newbie or non-ancient collector is scared of ""raw"" coins. Or a seasoned collector buys it and immediately cracks it out.  Another option is to get the coin certified. Like slabbing, a COA typically raises the value of a coin usually at least enough to cover the costs (unless a cheap coin to begin with) but with the benefit that most collectors don't treat the COA with disdain like they do the slab.  http://www.davidrsear.com/certification.html http://dirtyoldcoins.com/services/coa/roman-coin-certification.html"
AncientCoins,37eyul,jajorda2,2,Wed May 27 21:32:13 2015 UTC,"So here's the thing for me--  Up until about a week ago I was thinking that I wanted all my coins slabbed. I like slabs for their easy storage, their labelled attribution, resellability, etc. Now, I'm on the complete opposite side of the fence. Why? Because I cleaned some ancients.  Cleaning these and being able to hold them in my hands was an amazing feeling. As for storage? I'm buying a nice hand-made coin cabinet to hold all my ancients.  So it looks like I'm going to be breaking most of my coins out of the slabs. But that's okay with me. I want to hold them and enjoy their history."
AncientCoins,37eyul,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Thu May 28 14:28:59 2015 UTC,"If you plan on owning them for a long time, that makes sense. Decades from now maybe you could have them reslabbed for sale.  A coin in a slab is just a tease."
AncientCoins,37eyul,white_rabbit_object,1 point,Thu May 28 17:58:50 2015 UTC,"I'll echo the ""never"" answer myself.  I see my ancients as more of an art collection - one that lets me reach back and touch different periods and cultures in history - than as a traditional coin collection.  In that light, I don't really know what a slab would even mean, except for authenticity.  As /u/ikkiyikki pointed out, that can be accomplished with a COA if need be."
AncientCoins,37eyul,esnible,1 point,Wed May 27 22:40:41 2015 UTC,"If your coin is very tiny and fragile NGC will grade it without encapsulating it.  If you are planning to auction your coin, and you think it could get a MS or ✭ grade, it might be worth slabbing it."
AncientCoins,37cip7,jajorda2,3,Tue May 26 16:57:35 2015 UTC,Looks like maybe an issue of Hieron II. I don't know much about them but I have seen them in others' uncleaned lots before and that's the first thing that comes to mind given the style of the Trident and the things around it.
AncientCoins,37cip7,Red_Spork,2,Tue May 26 17:04:55 2015 UTC,"The only others I can think of that would have a trident might be Ptolemaic but I don't think they had any that were big and prominent like that. There are the AE series 5 trident coins(I posted some a couple months back) which have little mini tridents and there are a few gold coins which have Ptolemy III holding a Trident, but all the others I have seen with a trident had a trident counter stamp for revaluation as opposed to it being part of the original design."

AncientCoins,36w11m,subreddite,2,Fri May 22 22:23:01 2015 UTC,these washed off in distilled water except for the last two which i hot potted.
AncientCoins,36w11m,Red_Spork,4,Sat May 23 00:11:05 2015 UTC,"Looks like you got a Constantinopolis Commemorative in there, it and the Rome commemorative are some of my favorite LRBC."
AncientCoins,36rxf3,jajorda2,5,Thu May 21 17:14:19 2015 UTC,Currently soaking in distilled water. Some large (7) and mostly small coins. Many with already visible detail. 3 are silver and 1 is questionably so.   I'll post progress pics on here as time goes on.
AncientCoins,36rxf3,antiquarian_bookworm,4,Thu May 21 17:15:15 2015 UTC,Any results yet? It's been 2 hours...
AncientCoins,36rxf3,Red_Spork,2,Thu May 21 20:26:11 2015 UTC,Haha. I'm at work. I'll let you know when I get home and post some photos here of each of the good ones.

AncientCoins,36rxf3,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Thu May 21 22:18:38 2015 UTC,"IDd any yet? The silver looks like an unknown, a Septimius Severus denarius, and a Severus Alexander at first glance."

AncientCoins,36rxf3,antiquarian_bookworm,3,Thu May 21 17:58:05 2015 UTC,Really interested to see the progress here. I have been considering purchasing from CrustyRomans.

AncientCoins,36rxf3,Ogukuo,2,Thu May 21 21:28:29 2015 UTC,"You will find blanks in just about any sizable lot these days, such is life. The only way to guarantee real quality is to pay for the ones that got picked out of these bigger groups at much higher per-coin prices, usually buying just a handful of coins at a time."
AncientCoins,36rxf3,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Thu May 21 21:32:03 2015 UTC,"The lots that have the high priced ""premium"" coins are normally semi-dirty, and the dealer can see it is a good coin. So the upside is that you seldom get a slug, but the down side is that somebody has already peeked at what it is and you don't get those surprises found in a raw dirty lot.  I've had raw dirty lots that went above 50% slug rate. =-("
AncientCoins,36rxf3,pichoro,3,Thu May 21 22:47:07 2015 UTC,"I've bought some premiums that are very sweet indeed. I've also bought some premiums where I've thought, 'Are you kidding me?'  It seems people are moving the goalposts somewhat with regards to the quality of uncleaneds."
AncientCoins,36rxf3,TheGLpanda,3,Fri May 22 01:05:44 2015 UTC,"I've got 1/16kg of the Aurora myself. After two weeks in DI water I've got 2 greek coins (one really nice Ae19 from Mesembria, Thrace and one smaller guy from Zeugitanac, Carthage), 2 silvered guys (with pretty much all the silver stripped off and only a few little patches left, which is really frustrating), one larger Roman coin (can't figure it out yet) and about 30ish late roman bronzes. The late romans are cleaning up well and are mostly in good and very good shape as far as I can tell, although some have a pretty damaged patina (no idea how and why). I don't think that there will be a single slug so that's amazing! I was a little let down that mine are all late Roman since they didn't say it in the description even though it was really obvious as soon as I got them. Should have analysed the pics more... Enjoy your lot, I think there is plenty to be found!"

This was another awesome win from Agora Auctions. I saw one of these in the same shop that I bought my first ancient and finally found one in my price/quality sweet spot. There are various theories as to the identities/meanings of the faces: The Dioscuri Castory & Pollux, the sun and moon, other dualities in life, or possibly the two branches of the Danube.

AncientCoins,36dzj1,delafe,7,Mon May 18 23:00:53 2015 UTC,"As for value $5-10 each. All three appear to be genuine. The probus has dirt on it (does not appear to be original silvering)  Concerning fourrees, they were usually not official issues with few exceptions. No die links have been found so they were believed to have been made using forgers dies."
AncientCoins,36dzj1,jojo32,1 point,Tue May 19 00:58:00 2015 UTC,Forgive me I'm new to collecting what do you mean by its not the original silvering and what's a fourree?
AncientCoins,36dzj1,jojo32,2,Tue May 19 01:31:09 2015 UTC,A fouree is a term for essentially an ancient counterfeit. But more specific than that. Are you familiar with the denomination of denarius? Those are small silver roman coins. A fouree is when an ancient counterfeiter made the coin of bronze and plated it with silver to pass it as a real denarius. They are still very collectable. That is a fouree. This not to be confused with an antoninianus which is another denomination in roman coinage- antoninianus coins are of varying purities of silver and can even have no silver! Maybe just plated in silver.
AncientCoins,36dzj1,jojo32,2,Tue May 19 02:10:26 2015 UTC,"Very interesting! My knowledge about coins is more focused in American coins, though after I saw these I've started to become more interested in ancient coins."
AncientCoins,36dzj1,jojo32,2,Tue May 19 02:24:51 2015 UTC,Really fun stuff. I absolutely recommend it. It is quite challenging/time consuming to ID ancient coins. It feels so satisfying when you do though.
AncientCoins,36dzj1,jojo32,2,Tue May 19 02:36:09 2015 UTC,So are they all fourree's or is it just the probus coin?
AncientCoins,36dzj1,jojo32,2,Tue May 19 02:39:38 2015 UTC,"So have a look here: http://www.acsearch.info/search.html?term=Probvs+avg+clementia+temp&category=1-2&en=1&de=1&fr=1&it=1&es=1&ot=1&images=1&currency=usd&order=0&company= that is a bunch of coins similar to your first coin. See how some have a silvery appearance? That is because those happen to have retained their silver plating. It is an antoninianus denomination indeed. If you can get a clearer picture of the reverse, I can't make out the symbol in between the two figures."

AncientCoins,36dzj1,iSmokeGauloises,1 point,Tue May 19 03:45:22 2015 UTC,"I haven't looked at your coins specifically- but as someone else suggested, the probus may be a fouree. I don't personally think it is, but rather agree with someone's thought that it is an antoninianus."
AncientCoins,36dzj1,iSmokeGauloises,1 point,Tue May 19 03:03:29 2015 UTC,Can you make out the letters on the bottom of the constans coin? I cant find a match for the mint mark.

My latest doodles are a gothic looking box, instead of a refined wood cabinet.  I often doodle ideas for a long time before finally going in the workshop and trying to build it.  Another thing I've been doodling is a wall hanging that has the coins in custom made velvet lined holes, that you can either flip the frame over to view the other side, or have it on hinges so it swings back and forth. Again, antiqued gothic style frame."

AncientCoins,369iw3,manpace,4,Sun May 17 20:48:34 2015 UTC,"While the idea of storing coins in an ancient pot, jug, or amphora is an interesting idea we must remember that we are first and foremost the caretakers of our coins and artefacts and it is our utmost responsibility to ensure their safety. By placing coins in such an object you put the container at unnecessary risk every time you attempt to get a coin out. Ceramic containers are more fragile than our coins and do require more care. As such I would recommend not storing your coins in such an object. A replica maybe, but not an actual Roman ceramic vessel."

The trays fit in numismatic cabinets that allow you to transport your collection easily and safely. I also buy the transparent lids that go on top of each tray to prevent dust from landing on the coins, but they aren't needed if you keep the trays in the coin cabinet, it's just for display. With these trays, I can keep my favorite coins on my desk or nightstand when I'm home without having to worry about dust. When I leave home, I just put the tray(s) back into my safe. Many European professionals use the Maxi Beba cabinets."

I have two that were in my saltwater tank for 15 year, and they built up a fantastic encrustation patina of age to them. But, they also come with a fake patina, too.  Still, how to line the inside and how to get the coins in and out without tumbling them around excessively seems a bit of a problem.  The boxes I use for my coins are replicas of 19th century novels and have a fake patina of age that looks like old leather. I believe they sell them at shops like Hobby Lobby. Hobby Lobby has a lot of other Chinese made treasure chests that have pretty good fake antique patinas. Every time I go in there I inspect the items to figure out what techniques they used to antique them. Fairly well made."

AncientCoins,3657oc,Red_Spork,4,Sat May 16 06:43:12 2015 UTC,"This just came in the mail all the way from Israel today! This type is thought to be the oldest type of truly Jewish coinage - a prutah of John Hyrcanus I. After the death of the Seleucid King Antiochus VII, Judaea achieved full independence under Hyrcanus I, and whereas they had previously been granted authority to mint a sort of half-Jewish half-Seleucid series of bronzes, now they could do what they wanted. After gaining indepenence, the Jews began minting this type featuring a paleo-Hebrew legend within a wreath on one side and a double cornucopia(a ""horn of plenty"") flanking a pomegranate, a traditional Jewish symbol referenced several times in the old testament(the symbol was to be woven into the robes of the high priest even).   The legend reads ""Yehohhanan the high priest and the council of the Jews"", a reference to Hyrcanus's Jewish name ""Yehohhanan""(the hh is a hard h) and his advisors, the Jewish Council. The legend is in paleo-Hebrew as a way of linking the Hasmonean kingdom with the ancient kingdom of Israel under David. There is also a stylized ""A"" above the legend that is thought to be a reference to some sort of agreement between the Hasmoneans and the Seleucid ruler Alexander II.  To help make the legend a bit more clear, since I think the paleo-Hebrew script is one of the most interesting parts of these coins, I've uploaded a second photo where I've annotated the legend by coloring the first letter of each word and added the translation out to the side(note: the""HH"" is a hard/nasal H). I also uploaded a copy of the Israeli Antiquities Authority export certificate as I thought it was an interesting ""artifact"" of the process of buying an artifact straight from a licensed dealer in a source country. The process did take around 1 week for the dealer to get the paperwork and approval from the Israeli government for the export, but I honestly think it is a really great system that I wish more countries would adopt.  Full ID: Hasmonian Kingdom of Judaea, John Hyrcanus I AE Prutah. 135-104 BC. Obverse: 'A' monogram, YHO(HH)NN(""Yehochanan"") H(""the"") KHN(""Priest"") H(""the"") GDL(""high"") W(""and"") (HH)BR(""Council"") H(""the"") YHWDYM(""Jews"") Paleo-hebrew within wreath. Reverse: Double cornucopia adorned with ribbons, pomegranate between horns, border of dots. Jerusalem mint. Hendin 1132. Meshorer TJC A"

AncientCoins,3657oc,iSmokeGauloises,2,Sat May 16 07:05:37 2015 UTC,The modern 2 shekels coin shows the same reverse. Very cool coin. I'm jealous.
AncientCoins,3657oc,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Sat May 16 07:16:02 2015 UTC,"It's cheap and easy to find these ancient coins with the cornucopia on them, because the cornucopia was deeply struck, but the lettering is so tiny and low relief it is very hard to find good examples of readable coins. Sadly, most of them are just flat or bumpy on the inscription side.  That 2 shekel you show is trilingual, modern hebrew, english, and arabic."

AncientCoins,3657oc,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Sat May 16 12:46:52 2015 UTC,"It's a really sweet coin because the lettering is so complete and readable. With this type it is common to find them either worn flat on the text side, or only able to see half of the inscription at best. This is a one in a 100 coin, you would have to go through a hundred of them to find one in this condition.  I like alphabets and languages, so this one is special to me. My best one has at best 1/3 readable characters, with a big lump of corrosion obscuring the other half, that I have been afraid to touch.  There are some fresh nicks in the patina on the lettering, but those will tone down to darker over time. It must have been cleaned in the past year. Very nice two tone accent.  The best example I've seen in a long time."

It is OK but you have to be sure to tighten it down with a big honkin' DSLR or the shutter will cause shakiness Three lights similar to these, they don't have the exact ones I use but I do use the Mainstays brand. If you get these lights make sure you get the ones with the black lamp shades, or at least an opaque lamp shade.  Some of my older photos have a slight reddish tint because one of my original lights had a translucent red lamp shade. Also, the light placement is still something I'm experimenting with. It's really hard to get right and some coins do better with different placement than others. These LED bulbs. Sometimes you can catch them on sale for like $3-$4 each, the amazon price is ridiculous   I use a piece of paper for the background and set the coin on the rear lens cap that comes with Nikon lenses, but I feel like tupperware would work well too, the goal is to get the coin up off the surface a bit to reduce shadows.  I take photos in RAW and then postprocess in Adobe Lightroom to try to get the in-hand look, then use GIMP to cut out what background exists and combine. I could potentially use GIMP for both steps but lightroom is so easy for the first part.  Hope that helps! Let me know if you have any more questions and I'll do my best to answer"

Admittedly, I can't see myself splurging for such equipment right now (reasonably affordable as it is), but it it does help to visualise.  About how long would you say it takes to create a picture, from setting the coin down to the final image?"
AncientCoins,360ipa,SolarDub,1 point,Fri May 15 06:05:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't blame you, I was only able to justify this because my wife wanted a good camera for things so it wasn't strictly a coin purchase. Even then it was months until I got good lighting and a copy stand. Man was it a pain to photograph with only one light and holding the camera manually!  As far as time, it really depends but sometimes it only takes 5-10 minutes, sometimes it takes an hour. The easy ones are when all the presets get the coin exactly how I want it and the background is nice and uniform. The more difficult ones are when for whatever reason the background doesn't feel like being cut out as quickly or the presets totally throw the colors off and I have to manually tweak the photo quite a bit. This one was about 20 minutes. The Ptolemaic AEs I posted a month or so ago were only about 10 minutes for all 3. Editing definitely takes the longest though, I can shoot 30ish pictures in under 5 minuted and always end up with at least one good pair to work on."
AncientCoins,360i83,Yarcofin,6,Fri May 15 01:41:43 2015 UTC,"That first one is looking good. The photo is a bit fuzzy, but it looks like it has a bit more dirt on it to remove.  Clean slowly with the soft toothbrush and water. The biggest mistake that beginners make is to try to clean them all up in a few nights, and end up damaging the patina. Yes, the patina is that green coating. That's called a verdigris patina. On some coins the verdigris will start coming off, even if you are slow and careful. Then it is down to the bronze and will be shiney. Later it will build up a patina of brown tone and look better.  Leave off using the tooth pick until later, when you get the feel of just cleaning them and seeing what they look like with soft cleaning.  So for the first several weeks, soak them continuously and give them a light brush every night. Then change to only scrubbing them every several days.  Cleaning a coin can take anything from one day to a year. You will have some that are ""crusty"". That doesn't mean dirt, it means some of the green copper mineral has leeched out and joined with the dirt to create a hard shell around the coin. The soft brush won't work on those, and then you have to learn more techniques.   So that first coin you show is a good start, and it's your first one. Now you need to identify it, the other fun part of scrubbing.   Good job, keep going, slowly and softly. Post more as they come along and ask more questions."
AncientCoins,360i83,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Fri May 15 02:26:24 2015 UTC,"Perfect, thanks for your reply!  Can I ask what you think of soaking in olive oil instead of water? Will it help clean the coins faster, or is there too much risk of damaging the coins with it, if I'm not careful?"
AncientCoins,360i83,SolarDub,3,Fri May 15 03:17:21 2015 UTC,"My brief usage of olive oil was a pain. It didn't really have any advantage over the distilled water that I use. But it did make the coins oily (of course) and that was a pain to remove. Also, apparently, it causes the patina to darken considerably. I didn't use it long enough to notice.  I like your coin, by the way. I can pretty much tell what it is, but I'm going to leave to fun of that discovery for yourself.  Welcome to the club. :-)"
AncientCoins,360i83,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Fri May 15 04:18:37 2015 UTC,"No, oil is about the same speed as water. There is a rumor going around that it is an acid and powerful cleanser, but that is not true. The advantage of olive oil is that it will dissolve both polar inorganic materials and nonpolar organic materials, so it acts more like a mild detergent in that it picks up both types. Polar types are things like clay, and nonpolar is things like oils. Sometimes you will have a coin that is a dark ""dirt"", and it contains a rich mix of organic nonpolar materials that water does not pick up, and the water is repelled.  So olive oil is more a universal solvent than water is, but I find it is more a pain in the neck than necessary. Most coins will clean properly with just plain old water, and for the few that have high organic content, you can use a short soaking with mild detergent or I use ivory soap.  Becareful about using detergents because they often contain a lot of unknown stuff that might attack the patina.  And, as SolarDub mentions, the oil method makes the final coin darker green, sometimes too dark.  And one of the biggest reasons I don't use oil is because my pets are attracted to it, and I have to guard the containers so they won't drink them. They ignore the water.  I used to be a chemist when I was young. And, oddly enough, one of my specialties was quantitative analysis of ""dirt"". I know a lot, too much, about ""dirt"". =-}"
AncientCoins,360i83,ghsgjgfngngf,1 point,Fri May 15 11:31:13 2015 UTC,The fact that olive oil is acidic is not a rumour. It is easily verified.   https://www.google.de/?gws_rd=ssl#q=is+olive+oil+acidic+  It is not a strong acid but over time it will attach a bronze coin's surfaces. It doesn not have any cleaning properties beyond being a liquid and a weak acid. It is also a pain in the ass to work with. You're better off using distilled water but only if soaking the coins is necessary and useful.
AncientCoins,360i83,SolarDub,2,Sun May 17 20:34:19 2015 UTC,"On some coins the verdigris will start coming off, even if you are slow and careful.   Oh don't I know that! I have a couple of coins I've put to one side for now as during the initial clean the thin, loose patina immediately started deteriorating. Not sure what to do with these yet. Maybe I just have to suck it up, strip them back and allow nature and time to take its course?  Also, what people use the toothpick method, exactly what is going on here? I've always found a toothpick way too soft to make any difference. Granted some muck sticks to the end, but the end just becomes a dirty nub."
AncientCoins,360i83,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Fri May 15 04:23:48 2015 UTC,"As the verdigris patina forms from the corrosion of the bronze or copper, it can sometimes be dense and almost like an indestructible enamelized coating, or it can be ""fluffy"" and structurally weak. You try to clean them to retain this verdigris coating but the fluffy ones will want to fall apart easily, and sometimes you can't save it, so you have to strip the coin down to the bronze, or go for a two tone clean of bronze on the high points and green on the back field areas. That's why I suggested the OP not jump in with the toothpick right now, because he might have one with a fragile but savable patina, and wear it way with too much toothpick action. Beginners use too much aggression and force to the coin. You can always go back and clean a coin more later, when you have more experience, but if you have gone too far with it you can't put it back.  Sometimes you have a coin that cleans down to this fluffy weak patina, and it has a lot of detail in it, but then it is so weak that you can't keep it, and when you strip it down to the bronze you find the detail on the bronze is much less than what was on that verdigris coating. That's sad, but not much else you can do.   It's usually a good idea to pull good coins out of the bath that seem to be out of your experience level and just set them aside for future cleaning, after you have gained experience on the coins that are not so good.   A toothpick is good when you want to poke and stir at the mud or encrustation. Even though it seems like not much has come off, it is often more than just a soft brush will do. Also, if you have a coin that is 90% done but there is just a bit of dirt left on it, you can take a wooden toothpick and break off the end, then chew the end a bit to make a small stiff brush, and use circular scrubbing on that tiny spot of dirt. This lessens the time you would be soaking and scrubbing the whole coin, when only 10% of the coin actually needs cleaning. A sharp, unchewed toothpick is handy for getting the dirt out of tiny detail areas like lettering.  Beginners get too aggressive with the toothpick, and dig a hole in the patina, so at first it is best for them to stick with the soft toothbrush so they don't end up in tragedy. There are times when you can get very aggressive with even metal tools like brass brush and exacto knife, but you need to learn when you can get away with it and when you will cause damage.  When you have bad coins or slugs is a good time to practice some aggressive techniques to understand what happens."
AncientCoins,360i83,SolarDub,2,Fri May 15 12:02:28 2015 UTC,"I've put a couple of these coins aside just so I can determine whether or not to go ahead and just strip the rest of the weak patina. Beneath already shows some browning of the surface (not the shininess of the bare copper) suggesting that the elements have been working away already, so I should strip it and go from there.  I have also put aside some other coins where the (pretty good) detail is held in the dirt. I know this as where the dirt has gone, the relief is flat and discoloured where the detail was. Again, not quite sure what to do with some of these. However, others (like my Florian ant) I've just left and flipped without doing anything. Maybe I'll get some pics together just to illustrate.  For both cases, and especially the latter, I would warn any new cleaners to be especially careful. I learnt the hard way. I saw some coins that I thought could do with a light scrubbing and ended up scrubbing away the detail as that detail was in the dirt.  I'll try that toothpick method out. I have a couple of coins with a bit of muck on it that I can test with. I also have a couple with some spots of harder encrustation that I need to think about some more."
AncientCoins,360i83,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Fri May 15 16:41:43 2015 UTC,"When you say the ""detail was in the dirt"", you mean the dirt was acting as a two tone accent of the detail, and without the dirt it just was so monotone that even though the detail is still there, is was hard to make out, right?  If that is the case, then you are discovering the power of two tone cleaning. It can make a highly worn coin jump off the table at you.   Sometimes you have a coin with thin light colored green verdigris, and it is possible to lightly buff the high points, bringing the high points closer to the brownish bronze oxide layer. This gives a green/brown two tone.  And when doing two tone cleaning, it is important to know where the features are, so you have to ID the coin early in the process to know what needs exposing and what should stay.  I often pull my dirties out of the bath and leave them dry for a while, and think about where does this coin want to go? You can't always lead a coin to a certain method of cleaning, and the coin has it's own ideas of where it should go, and you need to visualize it different ways before just plowing forward with a general cleaning."
AncientCoins,360i83,SolarDub,2,Fri May 15 17:21:49 2015 UTC,"There may be a better way to describe it, but the relief seemed to constructed by the dirt. In other words, scrubbing away the coin removes the relief and thus the detail.  I have also cleaned coins past where I should have just stuck to two-tone cleaning. The relief was not sharp enough to see any detail once the dirt layer was removed. Live and learn with that. But this is different to what I originally mentioned."
AncientCoins,360saf,mbanana,3,Fri May 15 03:14:24 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Note that the author used the hardest graphite pencil to hand, which was 2B. This chart shows that is certainly not the hardest pencil to come by.  I've never tried this method, but I'll see about giving it a go.

I'm guessing the obverse of your Constantius II on the left still needs a bit of work? Where are you going with that one next?"

AncientCoins,360saf,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Fri May 15 05:17:37 2015 UTC,"The dirt in the details is a good time to use a toothpick, or a toothpick with the tip chewed. Twirl the toothpick in the detail. Don't be real aggressive and try to drill a hole with it, but use it like a micro brush with a bit of water or dampness, allowing to soak a bit, then twirl, then soak, then twirl."
AncientCoins,360saf,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Fri May 15 12:29:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've been doing that for years. The drawing of the graphite onto it is a very mild abrasive action, and then you pick it back up with an eraser. This is a final touching up part of cleaning, and I use it a lot for two tone cleaning. When you do a two tone clean, you want the details of the coin to stand out and leave the other dirt and/or verdigris to remain, so you are trying to only clean small spots of the coins. So a sharp pencil allows you enormous control over what gets worried away and what is left behind.  Also, there are different types of erasers. Some have high abrasion, and some have almost no abrasion. The high abrasion ones are usually what you find on the end of a pencil. The low abrasion ones are often called ""vinyl erasers"" or ""artist erasers"". You can tell how aggressive an eraser is by rubbing it on paper, If it remove a bit of the paper itself, that is very abrasive. If the eraser doesn't seem to touch the paper, and just ends up making soft rolls of crumbs, that is a very low abrasion eraser.  EDIT:  The high abrasion erasers are often red, and called ""red erasers"" by artists. The low abrasion ones are often white, or maybe dyed a light pastel color. Sometimes the color from the eraser can work it's way into the ""sand patina"" of a two tone coin, as well as the graphite, so if you are going for two tone, use with caution to avoid weird colors from graphite or eraser mottling up the color scheme"

The only reason I do it is because I like mystery and I used to do archeology, and with dirties I can do archeology at home. =-}  Cool is a matter of individual taste, but cool to me is if I clean the coin and it stumps me to figure it out for months on end. Or it is cool if it represents a pivotal point in history, and has a story to tell. I don't get upset about condition or value.  A tip is to only buy a small amount first, then evaluate them quickly, and buy again in larger quantities if they excite you."

The second one is Gordian III  The third one is Plautilla, wife of Caracalla.  Those are fairly rare and in good condition.

AncientCoins,35givt,antiquarian_bookworm,4,Sun May 10 04:17:44 2015 UTC,"Really nice coins.  When you can't figure out a coin, sometimes it is good to step back and state the obvious. Make a list of all the things you do know about the coin or a list of guesses, too.  The style looks middle eastern.  The obverse portrait has hair that looks like the person is a god, with rays coming off the head, too. Could it be Melqart (Melkart), Herackles (Hercules), or an odd Zeus? What other deity would be portrayed like that in the middle east?  The SC (SENATUS CONSULTUS) on the reverse shows it was under roman control. Also, this is only put on coins in the earlier times of the roman empire. What provinces did the romans control in the middle east at that time?  The things on the back, around the SC seem to be laural branches, which is typical with that type of reverse.  One of the coins is Tyche, goddess queen of cities, and wouldn't it really be a match to have this other coin be Melqart, the god king of cities? Make a nice pair of coins.  So that doesn't find the coin, but it brings us closer to having something to search for."
AncientCoins,35givt,ghsgjgfngngf,2,Sun May 10 12:16:39 2015 UTC,"Try Hatra as a search term for the second coin. Unfortunately, it is badly overcleaned but these are very popular."
AncientCoins,35eam7,ZanderCruze,3,Sat May 9 14:32:33 2015 UTC,"Well, you might be shuttling between  the ancient group here and the r/coins forum, because you are describing a time period from dark ages to 19th century. The rules aren't real strict, this group is for ancient and medieval, from deep antiquity to about 16th century, and stuff like Habsburg is what we would call ""modern history"", so you would get better answers over in the r/coins group.  And Vikings didn't make their own coins, they stole other peoples. =-}  That was humor! don't attack me Viking dudes!"
AncientCoins,35dgee,manpace,2,Sat May 9 06:35:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, good write up and nice coin.  Here's some other interesting things that most people don't know about ""Germany"":  There were no ""germans"". That is a latin word that kind of means ""place of emanation"". In the early days of the roman republic the romans kept meeting tribes coming from the north, and there seemed to be so many different tribes, the romans thought that people and tribes were being spontaneously created there. There was the myth that it was a birthing place for tribes. Thus they ""germinated"" from that region.  So when romans refer to Germania, they are referring to any land to the north, and not the people specifically. Some of the tribes actually were coming from the great plains regions of Sythia, and then coming from the north to roman land, so the romans still called them germans because of where they were.  And there really never was a Germany until the 19th century. That region was composed of many tribes from different places, and they held their own identity until they became a collective of states in the 19th century.  Still they don't call themselves ""Germans"" because that is a latin word, and so there is the loosely defined term they use ""deutsch"" to refer to people of their region."
AncientCoins,35dgee,antiquarian_bookworm,3,Sat May 9 13:13:24 2015 UTC,"Quite right.  The Romans would fight one tribe and then find another taking their place.  Roman armies were very good at fighting other armies, and taking cities from those armies.  Early days in ""Germania"" there were no armies and no cities, just loose tribal confederations and war bands that would harass and run.  It wasn't so much like that later - tribes found Roman organization and ambitions inspiring and started developing war machines of their own, but they were no easier to conquer.  And I goofed about calling them all Germans - the Iazyges are the Scythians you are talking about, and Marcus Aurelias be-titled himself Sarmaticvus after extracting a temporary peace treaty from their king."
AncientCoins,35dgee,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Sat May 9 14:09:30 2015 UTC,"Julius Caesar was successful in conquering the fragmented and migratory tribes because he would actually meet with them, study them, ask them questions, and then use that information to play political games with them to conquer them. He ""spied"" on them by inviting them to dine with him, or sometimes even going to their house for dinner. =-} He actually had a high opinion of these people he was conquering.  Other military leaders considered it beneath their dignity to schmooze with the ""barbarians"", and thus they were operating with the handicap of not understanding who they were fighting or what they were up to and actually causing the tribes to create temporary unions to defeat the invaders.  ""Know thine enemy"" =-}  When tribes unify under one absolute leader, then conquering them just becomes a game of capture the king, like chess. When they are migratory and independent, it becomes hard to win the game because there are too many kings and they are mysteriously moving around the board. This is what Julius had to deal with in Gaul, so Julius's technique of political maneuvering and playing the tribes off each other allowed him to make large gains with low losses.  Another interesting thing is that the romans used strategic planning, and in the early days the tribes saw that as cowardly ""cheating"". a real warrior charged into the enemy, and the gods determined the outcome of the most noble. Too much preparation showed a lack of faith in the gods and righteousness. The romans were big cheaters."
AncientCoins,35dgee,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Sat May 9 14:33:02 2015 UTC,"I think Caesar fell in the same trap as others, though - conquests in Germania mattered for the stature that they gained you in Roman politics, and not for any particular policy towards the peoples or territory.  I find the Varus disaster especially interesting because it showed how little he knew about Germania - and I think it depended on whom you schmoozed with.  Arminius was not worthy of confidence as events bore out.  Varus didn't know the people, the populations, the countryside he was supposedly dominating.  He trusted the untrustworthy, wasn't aware what was going on all around him, and somehow missed even the very existence of an army capable of destroying him until he was doomed.  Also, I'm interested where you read about a barbarian ethic against preparation?  Teutoburg Forest was obsessively planned and the legions lured there and was about the furthest thing from a fair fight ever."
AncientCoins,35dgee,born_lever_puller,2,Sat May 9 15:05:57 2015 UTC,"The idea that most barbaric tribes didn't plan their attacks comes from observations from romans, so it might be a slanted and ego-stroking viewpoint by the romans, and not as true as they liked to believe. Julius mentions this ""noble spirit"" as an exploitable weakness of the tribes. Sometimes he wanted them to attack before they could be prepared, to seize the advantage. The romans were very methodical about their military operations, so I suppose they are right in their dismissal of the relative lack of military planning of the tribes.  The roman plan was world domination, so conquering as much as possible was the political plan of the romans. Many theories about the fall of rome was that they had bitten off more than they could chew; they never quite controlled a lot of the land they ""conquered""."

The flip side of this is earlier in the empire, the legionary denarii that Marc Anthony used to pay his legions leading up to Actium were about 80% pure compared to many other denarii at the time at 95%+.

I've got a couple of those, and yours is a bit above mine in quality.  Here's another one from Iberia of Augustus minted at about the same time.   http://i.imgur.com/AbiqTX0.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/1XpAMF1.jpg  The size, weight, patina, and feel of the coin is the same as your Julia Traducta coin. It has roman religious articles on the back.  The relationship between rome and iberia were pretty good. There were few if any rebellions and the flow of commerce made both areas well off. People with money in their pockets don't revolt. A lot of the trade was olive oil.  Here is a mountain of olive oil ""empties"" in rome, discarded amphora from trade with iberia.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Testaccio  The mutually beneficial financial association between rome and iberia made them staunch allies, as opposed to other people in the empire who benefited less, and had to be constantly suppressed."

AncientCoins,35094g,EvilCartyen,1 point,Wed May 6 01:11:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's called two tone dirty cleaning. Some people don't like it and say ""Hey, when are you going to clean that coin?"". =-}  It is one way to take a coin with low relief and tiny detail and make it very readable.  To do that, you have to watch your coins very carefully when they come out of the bath, and catch them before too much dirt has come off. You also need a very fine grain dirt that is well adhered. Then that pencil eraser you see becomes part of the cleaning process from there on in, and no more long soaking. You can either work it dry, or get it wet when you are cleaning it, but soaking for a long tie can make big chunks fall off.  Sometimes they have thick verdigris that is worn, obscuring the detail, so you have to strip it to the bronze.  I showed a wooden coin vise in a thread a few months ago, and these tiny ones really benefit from it, because if you are working on it and it flips into the carpet, you will have a hell of a time trying to find it again. I think I've lost a few that way."
AncientCoins,34whgu,manpace,6,Tue May 5 03:14:50 2015 UTC,"Tetricus II antoninianus with an exceptionally rare NOBILITAS reverse.  Sold earlier this year at auction, I acquired it last month on you-know-where for a similar price.  The numismatic bias against barbarous coins is on full display - since it is obviously not from an official mint it is of scant interest to the big boys, who would happily pay fifteen times the amount for a ""genuine"" article.  NOBILITAS is a curious title back from Republican days and denotes a person from a family who had placed one of their members in the consulship.  Unlike the ""nobility"" of later European aristocracy you could have a plebian family become ""nobiles"", provided someone, some ""New Man"" was elected consul.  That man's descendants would share the title.  In the intervening centuries the meaning changed, but if I understand rightly, the sense of it would have been similar.  It might seem peculiar that such a person as Tetricus II would claim the label - he who spent some months as co-emperor of a ramshackle and rapidly dwindling breakaway Gaulish Empire - the more so because so few Emperors in Roman history ever claimed the title.  But the Tetricii were actually of ""noble"" stock - Tetricus II's father was a Roman senator and had been appointed Governor of Aquitaine before he was invested with the dangerous purple robe of Gaul.  This sets the Tetricus boys apart from Postumus, Victorinus and the whole host of military nobodies who fought their way to the top in Gaul during the rough-and-tumble 3rd century crisis.  Indeed, the Tetricii were even socially superior to some ROMAN emperors of the times, and it is a fun historical irony that when Tetricus' forces faced those of Aurelian at the Battle of Chalons, the fancier family was on the breakaway side.  Tetricus was the last emperor of breakaway Gaul, and his defeat in that battle reunited the empire.  Aurelian captured father and son and subjected them to the humiliations of a triumph, parading them through the streets of Rome as captives of war.  But rather than an ignominious post-parade strangling (like happened to another, earlier Gaulish leader), Aurelian spared their lives, recognized their abilities, and rewarded them with offices even higher than the ones they held before their revolt!  I mentioned that NOBILITAS is a rare title to see claimed on coinage, appearing on a smattering of rulers from Commodus on down through the middle of the 3rd Century.  No one in Roman history claimed the title after Tetricus II, so I call him ""The Last Noble of the Ancient World"".  Indeed, since my coin is a barbarous imitation, it had to be struck some time after the official issue, which I have already noted was brief and meager.  Thus it is a strong possibility that of all Roman coins recovered in modern times, this specimen was the very final NOBILITAS to be struck.  EDIT: I should clarify that plenty of 4th century rulers claimed NOBILITAS on their coins, contracted as NOB.  This Tetricus was, I think, the last to put the personification thereof on the reverse.   Tetricus II barbarous antoninianus  Struck in Gaul, 273-274, 2.32 grams  Obverse: Caesar, facing right, draped, curiassed.  Reverse: Nobilitas, the personification of nobility, stands right, holding scepter in one hand and an apple in the other.  Inscriptions  Obv: IMP C ESV (PIV?) TETRIC  Rev: NOB...ITAS AV  Struck off center.  Design space on obverse is significantly smaller than that of reverse.  Soft strike visible opposite emperor's face, and an undertype is visible - probably evidence of a double strike.  Auction listing was indifferently written and does not accurately describe coin.  Other examples show Nobilitas holding a globe, but on my coin the globe has a stem, so I am assuming it's an apple."
AncientCoins,34whgu,iSmokeGauloises,3,Tue May 5 04:17:52 2015 UTC,What an interesting piece of history. NOBILITAS sounds like a very odd thing to write on your coin indeed.
AncientCoins,34whgu,ghsgjgfngngf,3,Tue May 5 07:47:50 2015 UTC,"It is true though that for studying coinage, dating, and things like that, which numismatic Academia is concerned with, an unofficial coin has no value. Inofficial coins show all kinds of 'rare reverses', especially the ones that are only very loosely based on anything official. So collectors' standards for rarity do not apply. Collectors like to complete sets. Inofficial radiates are a field that you could never complete, which is another reason they're rather unpopular. You can still like them and collect them but their value for the science of numismatics is very limited and it's hard to make them into any kind of systematic collection so most people might buy one or two as a curiosity at best. I also don't agree with those people that treat an ancient fake the same as modern one."
AncientCoins,34whgu,antiquarian_bookworm,4,Tue May 5 09:01:36 2015 UTC,"On forgerynetwork.com, some collectors got carried away and started listing barbarics in the database as forgeries. There was a big bru-ha-ha over that, and the outcomes was that they are allowed to list them. So if people use that database, make sure to read the notes to find out what type of forgery it is.  I like barbarics, as much or more than official issues. Sometimes the writing on them can make you laugh, obvious the forgers were illiterate."
AncientCoins,34whgu,ghsgjgfngngf,4,Tue May 5 13:32:08 2015 UTC,They weren't even forgeries as such when they were originally made!
AncientCoins,34whgu,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Tue May 5 14:44:25 2015 UTC,"Don't you think many collectors would accept a barbarous example as a placeholder for a rare type, so they can have their ""complete set""?  But quite right about numismatics; I would not say that my coin is proof that other Nobilitas reverses are actually holding apples and not globes.  Whatever their value for official-mint-numismatics, they can still have considerable historical importance - like for instance observing how loosely the objects and symbolism on Roman coins could be interpreted by the citizen at large - seeing an apple as a globe etc.  And there are examples where the barb is worth more than a genuine article, depending on the relative scarcity of each.  I talked to a dealer the other day who clearly saw no difference between a modern and ancient forgery; it makes communication difficult because for him there's no reason to clarify whether the coin was ancient or modern."
AncientCoins,34whgu,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Tue May 5 14:50:34 2015 UTC,"I'm interested in the history and the barbarics are certainly part of the history. As you mention, it says a lot about the time and the people at that time.  I used to do volenteer work in archeology, and the stuff that was often the most scientifically important would normally be things that collectors wouldn't even want. Sometimes a whole pot was beautiful, but not terribly siginificant, but a stone chip that was known to come from 500 miles away would be an indicator that this tribe had contact over that distance... very exciting. Then archaeologists at that other location might confirm that they found an item from our location, and those little ""worthless"" items establish a trade link between the tribes. Obsidian for pottery commerce, but only some chips were found.   What can be exciting for a history collector can look very unappealing to some people and have a lower market value. This creates an opportunity for bottom feeders like me to pick them up."
AncientCoins,34wurr,Gordopolis,4,Tue May 5 05:42:06 2015 UTC,"Nice coin. Are you asking for people to identify it for you, or would you rather have hints and tips about how to do it yourself?  The patina is a bit choppy. What are you using for cleaning? Water and soft tooth brush?"

AncientCoins,34wurr,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Tue May 5 16:46:02 2015 UTC,"Try not to use detergent unless you find the water alone can't work. Detergents can attack the patina, especially if it has lemon or other scents in it.  Some coins will have an organic material (""oils"") mixed in with the dirt, and they repel water, so I occasional use ivory soap. It has no additives that might attack the patina.   You have a light green patina, with a darker green choppy coating on top of it, or that is what it looks like in the photo. If you clean it more, you might be able to remove the darker green to give a uniform light green patina. The two colors distract the eye from the details on the coin.  Yeah, I remember the thrill of my first coins. =-}  Show more as they come out."
AncientCoins,34wurr,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Tue May 5 18:22:17 2015 UTC,"Great advice, I didn't realize dish soap could have that effect.  From now on I'll use water alone and see how it goes.  Will definitely post my results"

But this is not a fake intended to defraud anyone, since it wouldn't fool a collector. This is the caliber of fakes that is usually sold to tourists in places like Tunisia, Egypt etc., which is why they are often called 'tourist fakes'."
AncientCoins,34vykb,antiquarian_bookworm,3,Tue May 5 09:04:38 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit suspicious that it is a cast replica. There is void in the hair on the obverse, the features are soft, and there is strange cracking on both the obverse and reverse. It's an artificial patina, but that doesn't mean it is fake, because some people put artificial patinas on real coins.   Don't take only my opinion, wait for more. I'm not declaring fake, just suspicious.   Where did you get the coin?"
AncientCoins,34vykb,antiquarian_bookworm,3,Tue May 5 01:12:00 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the same. Believe it  or not i found it in the woods, in a tree stump inside an easter egg hahaha.

AncientCoins,34vykb,jojo32,0,Tue May 5 01:34:28 2015 UTC,"The thickness, roundness, and bust on the obverse all remind me of Seleucid empire.  Seleucid coins ---> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucid_coinage  Seleucid empire ---> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucid_Empire  I can't make out the reverse, and it doesn't ring a bell with me. If the coin is a fake it might be a fantasy, meaning some artist just went wild in making something that they liked, not following any coin design. Same thing with the bust, it might not fit any emperor, and just be an artistic fantasy. Unless somebody out there recognizes what that reverse can be?  Premium Seleucid coins are seldom found in easter eggs inside trees. =-} Maybe elf treasure."
AncientCoins,34vykb,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Tue May 5 01:59:14 2015 UTC,"I thought it looked suspicious when I opened the picture, but at the same time thought to myself, well it COULD be real. These other guys here have been doing this much longer than I have so when I read the comments, they confirmed my suspicion. Still I personally like fakes anyways. There are ancient fakes that are collectable, and then there are modern fakes as well. Modern fakes are more commonly referred to as ""tourist replicas"" because they aren't made to fool anybody- only to be a souvenir."
AncientCoins,34vykb,jojo32,2,Tue May 5 06:26:49 2015 UTC,"Unless a coin is a glaring fake, I proceed with caution and only point out suspicious things. The longer the list gets, the more the fake-o-meter points to fake.  Low end casts have rounded edges on all surfaces, and that's called softness. Softness can be caused when a real coin had a thick patina, and it was stripped away, creating a uniform layer of material to be removed from all the surface.  A void can be caused by pitting of corrosion. Some corrosion forms what I call ""volcano"", and digs deep into one spot of the coin. If the corroion is cleaned out, it leaves a void. The void on this coin does not look like a volcano remnant, it looks like a casting bubble. The lack of any other signs of corrosion pitting makes that void very suspicious.  The cracking looks like contraction of the metal after casting. That one is a real give away.  Another thing to look at is the edge of the coin. Fakers need to cover up the cast seam and sprue, so they either file it off or try to patinate it so heavily with dirt that it becomes obscured.   So sometimes one suspicious thing doesn't totally condemn a coin, because it could have occurred naturally. A pile of suspicious things starts to condemn a coin."

AncientCoins,34vykb,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Tue May 5 16:38:24 2015 UTC,"Bad news, it's an undeniable fake. I found a die match with the  Antiquanova replica on this page. Look at the ""tooled"" image, and notice the tiny details like the sigma on the reverse, crossing the boundary of the die edge. Too many details match. The forger tried to cover it up by making the coin unique with different methods, but the tiny details give it away.  http://alexanderthegreatcoins.reidgold.com/modern_replicas.html  I stumbled over that by accident. By the way, when posting something like that for evaluation, try to get sharper images, and include photos of the edge. Especially where flan cracks may cross the edge.  But other things I can say about your coin are that you can see it is a struck or pressed die coin, because the sharp details in the face of zeus are good, and there are stress marks above his arm on the right. Not a cheezy cast.  This coin was most likely corroded, to produce the pitting on the fields, then buffed with a mild grit to produce the wear on the high points.  I saw this was no low end fake. Once I found the evidence of a true die, I knew it might be a high end fake. Then I would have gone to forgerynetwork to look for die matches, but this slow modem chokes a lot on pulling that up. This die is most likely on that database.  There are so many fakes of these Alexander the Great coins, because he was just so Great that everybody wants one. And the art on them tends to be a fantastic example of classical greek artwork."

Yeah, I think yours has been retooled a bit, but the details of the match to Antiquanova's die are just too great to dismiss it.

AncientCoins,34vykb,jojo32,2,Tue May 5 19:53:22 2015 UTC,"I just did an image overlay match, and the alignment of yours is identical to the replica.  To do this you use an graphics manipulation program, like photoshop. I use the free GIMP. You pull up one image on the canvas, then make a new layer and pull up the other image onto the separate graphics layer. Then you fade the alpha channel of one of the images so it is semi-transparent. Then slide one image over the top of the other. If they are identical, they will ""click"" together when you get the alignment right. If they are not identical, you will see the ghost image does not match.  So here is the ghost image (your coin) purposely shifted down and to the right of the tooled forgery, to show what I'm doing...  http://i.imgur.com/LNYZ57q.jpg  Here is when I slide it over, and pop, the two images are identical.  http://i.imgur.com/5ED08oH.jpg  Fakes dealers know this trick, so often they will show distorted or weird angle shots of their coins on ebay to prevent this from working.

Only I would give it one more light scrub, there's some schmutz on the emperor's face. =-}  And the quadriga on the forth one is great. Nice detail, you can see the chariot and wheel, which is usually smooshed into something unrecognizable. And there's that big hand coming down from above, which people argue over what that means. I'm undecided on that.  Otherwise, nice job on all of them. Those were the easy ones.   Water and soft toothbrush?"
AncientCoins,34oei3,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Sun May 3 01:34:11 2015 UTC,"Yup water and soft toothbrush.  On a couple I used a little pick to nudge some stubborn dirt off.  Got impatient lol.  I just took the obligatory pictures of a few of the ""mysterious"" coins in this lot.  They will need more cleaning, but I think you'll be able to lead me in the right direction.  I just identified the first one as a byzantine pentanummium.  The second and third coins are a little thicker with higher reliefs than roman coins I've come across.  They are both very small, about 15mm and 12mm.  One kind of looks like there is a bunch of grapes on the reverse.  The other looks like either a vase or a fruit.  http://imgur.com/2oYBtDF,eyWvPom,caoWnK5,SOpPyqk,imXGncd,Dm347Bn,JaQAMlB#0"
AncientCoins,34oei3,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Sun May 3 01:46:48 2015 UTC,"First coin is byzantine nummi, and the reverse is upside down.  Second coin is... is... an alien! =-} On the reverse is probably a modius. I'll let you chase that one. =-}  The third coin is the most interesting. It has an amphora, and a nice one too. Colonial roman? That one is going to be special. I want that one.  I think this is a good dirty lot. Any slugs?"
AncientCoins,34oei3,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Sun May 3 02:16:47 2015 UTC,"My glaber lot had 60 coins in total.  I think I saw about 10 that were completely caked in mud that will take a week or so to get down through.  Of the other 50, one will definitely need to go through electrolysis or some other harsh cleaning.  The rest all have detail, they just need further cleaning.  So I would say probably very few, if any, slugs.  My Bali lot from Crusty Romans looks like nearly a third of the coins have a high probability of being slugs.  I think there were about 45 coins in total.  15 were possible slugs, 15 were too encrusted to tell, and 15 definitely had detail.  The upside is that the lot contains very few late Roman coins, so what I am able to identify will probably diversify my collection significantly.  I picked out two Byzantine follis.  Unfortunately they looked like they had metal caked onto them as well as a decent amount of bronze disease, so I did a quick electrolysis which took all that off.  They are looking okay now but there's still some stubborn silver-colored metal stuck to the obverse that I'll need to grind off."
AncientCoins,34oei3,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Sun May 3 04:27:45 2015 UTC,"Remember it is better to go slow to avoid making irreversible mistakes. Sometimes in the rush to clean coins, a person gets too eager and too aggressive with the coin. You can always go back later and clean a coin more, but you can't put it back.  These are sounding like interesting lots. I hope to see more of it.  I've found true bronze disease to be a lot more rare than most people claim. You will find out if you have bronze disease if you clean the coin, and then the dusty green grows back weeks later. Sometimes it seems like bronze disease when you clean a coin, and the next day there is dusty green, but it was because the coin wasn't dry and when it properly dried overnight, it looked different.  It's good to try to identify your coins before you finish cleaning them, because knowing what they are helps guide the cleaning by knowing what features need exposing. It also makes the guessing game more fun."

AncientCoins,34oei3,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Sun May 3 13:18:33 2015 UTC,It's addicting.  These Crusty Roman lots are going to last me a long time.  I still have a whole bunch from Noble Romans that are soaking.  I just skimmed through my Bali lot again and noticed that it contains about a quarter Greek coins based on the flan.  The most exciting one to me has what I think is a dolphin on it.  I'll clean it up and take a picture now.
AncientCoins,34oei3,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Sun May 3 13:22:41 2015 UTC,"Ahhh! You're getting me stirred up. I didn't buy a new lot for my birthday present because I failed to quit smoking. I'm in the naughty chair. =-( I've been stopping and starting, skipping days.   You can feel the culture in the flan now, right? That's how the dealers segregate the lots, sometimes. I don't like segregated lots, because it reduces the exciting diversity of the coins.  When you feel a greek coin, remember that it can be greek influence. Alexander spread the greek minting technology all over the eastern med.  And that dolphin sounds exciting. Might be a fish.  Once you get the hang of it, you probably will not want help anymore, because solving the mystery is the fun. Just ask for clues, not hits."

AncientCoins,34oei3,SolarDub,1 point,Sun May 3 13:37:27 2015 UTC,"Could be a dolphin, certainly not a fish. Fish are depicted straight, not curved like that.  Dolphin was a popular image in greek culture, starting with the Mycenaean period.  What's your opinion of that waxy look to coins? You can make them super shiney, or more of a matte finish, depending on how thick you go with the wax. You can experiment on slugs. I use candle wax. Rub some on, then put it on a warm surface (not real hot!). Slowly the wax melts into the porous surface and then you wipe it down to remove excess.  One thing you will find is that everybody has their own idea of beauty of cleaning a coin. My local coin shop guy, who specializes in roman, is disgusted by wax and any coin that is shiny. He likes a dusty patina. Other people like the wax heavy, like that other coin you saw with the amphora (krater). The nice thing about having a lot of coins in that you can experiment a lot with different cleaning methods.  And of course there is the dirty cleaning method... you leave some dirt or encrustation on the coin to accent the features. If you do a ""dirty clean"" of a coin, and latter on decide you don't like it, you can always go back and strip it down to be cleaner. Putting the dirty back on is very difficult. =-}"
AncientCoins,34o6cw,thisisATHENS,3,Sat May 2 23:40:57 2015 UTC,"On the Constantine I, I'm mildly suspicious that there are no stretch marks (also called stress or flow marks). On coins that have very low corrosion, like that one, you normally see ripples in the coin that are caused by the rapid striking of the die. I have seen real coins that have very tiny stress marks, but on this coin I see none. I give it a 90% chance of being real. The art work looks very proper.  The Constantine II looks more suspicious. Notice the ""N"" and the ""S"" are joined, and that odd flat field with corrosion only around the lettering and image. I've never seen a coin in that condition. I suspect a cast. Also, I can't pull up the reverse of that coin.  The Valentinian looks OK, except there is that odd mixture of extremely flat field and high corrosion again.  Don't take my opinions too seriously, I'm not an expert at picking fakes, I'm just throwing in my cheezy opinion."

These were struck by the Jews in Judaea during the First Jewish War/The Great Revolt, the same one Vespasian and Titus put down and commemorated on Judaea Capta issues. Regardless of how said war turned out, these coins have some extremely cool history behind them.  Also, if you're wondering why the inscription is in paleo-Hebrew, it's because even though the script wasn't in use by the population at the time, the Hasmoneans, the leaders of the Great Revolt and the leaders of Bar Kochba wanted to sort of draw a parallel between themselves and the ancient kingdom of David using this ancient script.  Judaea. First Jewish War. Struck year two 67/68 A.D. Obverse: Rimmed amphora with paleo-Hebrew inscription YEAR TWO. Reverse: Vine leaf on small branch with tendril, paleo-Hebrew inscription FREEDOM OF ZION. Hendin 661"

AncientCoins,34h2vd,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Fri May 1 02:47:57 2015 UTC,"Needs cleaning,,, send to me. =-}  That is amazingly good for that issue. I have only one, and on the obverse it is totally blank, as if the die never struck. Not worn, just blank. The other side has only about 50% of the coin, a nice grape leaf and a couple letters, but the other 50% of the coin never took the die. So it's like 1/4 struck, but sharp.  Anyway great readability, great patina, great two-tone."
AncientCoins,34h2vd,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Fri May 1 03:16:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks. It's really cool to find a nice example of just about any Judaean issue. It seems they were all struck fairly sloppily with little regard to centering, strike quality and die wear. I have seen many like yours where one side is OK and the other is blank or is extremely off center."

Crustyromans seems to be on the more expensive side, but the coins themselves are very high quality.  I think the hoards vary a lot.  In my glaber lot, over half the coins can already be identified and just need a bit of cleaning up.  Many have very fine detail showing.  My bali lot has a bit more variety but more coins that will need a bit of work.  They are both looking real good.  I'll probably buy from them again."
AncientCoins,34gk7v,ir0nli0nzi0n,1 point,Fri May 1 01:07:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's not so much the dealer that determines the quality. Some times even good dealers can have some rather shabby lots. Even they are gambling when they buy.  And some types of lots are shabby by nature, due to the soil conditions they were found in or because in some areas at some times in history, coins were used until they were slugs, so from that area it is almost impossible to get a sweet lot. You are seeing the coins they actually circulated."
AncientCoins,34gk7v,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Fri May 1 01:33:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah true.  Judging from the two lots that I bought, Crustyromans shows very fair pictures of the lots on their website.  My lots closely matched the pictures in terms of overall condition.  I'll probably be enlisting your help with identifications soon lol.  I found one coin that looks like a Greek boat of some sort.  I'll clean it up a bit, but unfortunately it's significantly worn."
AncientCoins,34gk7v,ir0nli0nzi0n,1 point,Fri May 1 02:05:25 2015 UTC,Pictures that don't match the coins is a major reason for me to not buy from a seller.  And a boat... I'm very interested. A whole boat or a prow?

AncientCoins,34gk7v,ir0nli0nzi0n,2,Fri May 1 02:27:17 2015 UTC,"It's a submarine! =-}  That hole is a punch mark for centering, and that reminds me more of some Seleucid than real greek. It's definitely greek influence, with that flan shape.  I can't think of anything besides it being a boat, but I don't recall a whole boat like that in any coins I know. Usually it's a prow. The way it is depicted seems like Phoenician. Seleucid-phoenician... mmmm  The face on the obverse doesn't ring a bell, either. A lot of Seleucid kings were portrayed with no crown or ornament, so again I'm thinking Seleucid.  So the clues seem to be Seleucid Phoenician boat bronze... google search.  When you find the coin, you might find there is writing at certain places on the coin which are not worn, under the verdigris. That is when you might decide to try to clean it more, to expose those features. There is a point when you want to stop cleaning to figure out where the features are."
AncientCoins,34gk7v,antiquarian_bookworm,3,Fri May 1 02:56:26 2015 UTC,"I found this coin http://www.ancientresource.com/images/greek/ancient-coins-greek/greek-warship-0806.jpg  ""Seleucid Kingdom. Demetrios II, 183-129 BC. Beautiful bronze AE18, Tyre mint in Phoenicia. Diademed head of Demetrios rt. / Stern of galley, BASILEWS DHMHTPIOY TYPIWN, Phoenician script below.""  The obverse actually looks pretty similar.  My view of the obverse in person is a little better than my photograph.  The boat has some similar traits (those boxy things directly above the hull), but I can't make out any oars on mine.  I think you are right on about that Seleucid-phoenician!"
AncientCoins,34gk7v,ir0nli0nzi0n,2,Fri May 1 03:44:40 2015 UTC,"Yep, I think you nailed it.   Those boxy things are the boat rails.  A bilingual coin of phoenician and greek languages, and the two alphabets to go with it. Never heard of that before. But the coin merges the two cultures, so it was a long shot. Very cool, I like languages and alphabets.   The side with the boat may have more detail under the verdigris, or it may not. The dish shape of the coin protects that side from wear. The verdigris itself might be worn, hiding the writing and more detail under it. So the dicey decision here is should it be cleaned more, to find it, or left alone? Personally I'd gamble on cleaning it more, but it's your decision.  You can't use mechanical tools to wear down and expose that detail. That leaves chemical or electrolysis or heat.  For chemical, I'd use vinegar or lemon juice, Do not just let it soak for a long time, you need to keep pulling it out and wiping it off and checking it. If you can't keep monitoring it, then wash it and leave it dry for times when you can pay attention to it.  I won't describe electrolysis, because it is too long.  The heat method is to heat it up on a stove burner, just above boiling and then drop it into water. Wipe off, and repeat. The difference in expansion coefficient between the metal and the verdigris causes the verdigris to crack and crumble off .  So you need to decide, do you feel lucky, or leave it alone? If you use one of the methods above, I would suggest the acid. It will eat slowly, and you can stop it with a bit of verdigris left, if you want to. The other two methods blows the verdigris away totally."
AncientCoins,34gk7v,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Fri May 1 04:13:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I'll try acid method first this weekend.  I've done electrolysis on some roman coins that were severely encrusted with metalic-like crust.  I don't think I would want to go that route with this coin.  On an unrelated note, I just found this guy on my preliminary sort/clean of this CrustyRoman lot.  I think it's the finest detailed coin that I've found so far.  http://imgur.com/faJc1Ym,DVv1bkn#1"

Another of my batches of ""roman"" coins from ""balkan states"" had a a coin minted by Vlad the Impaler's grandfather. That one was a shock. It was small and thin, like a roman follis.

I can't remember the name of the dealer. For culls, they were in great condition. Cash coins can take a lot of abuse and still be readable.   One thing you will find with a lot of the offerings that are real, is that they actually were found as a hoard, so a pile being sold might have a very short time frame, sometimes all the same emperor.  Maybe a dealer you know who is knowledgeable about cash can suggest a source. If I could ""skim"" the dealers, I could probably find the guy, and he might know sources, but slow modem, yada-yada...

With a wild mixture of other stuff. Middle eastern lots are the wildest mixture.  I don't suggest cleaning for people who want to build a specific collection, because you will be hoping for something you may never find. If your heart is set on something, just buy them already cleaned. For example, I was bummed out after years that I never got any phoenician with writing on it, so I had to break down and buy a couple of those. I like the alphabets and languages.  I buy from known dealers who have been in business for a long time, and I've bought from all of the name brand ones who sell dirties. Even if they are an old respected dealer, you still can get bad batches. It's a real dodgy game.

AncientCoins,33t5w8,iSmokeGauloises,4,Sat Apr 25 11:09:34 2015 UTC,"Some information can be found in the corresponding RIC volumes, but apart from that your best bet would be other numismatic publications. You can try search here: http://donum.numismatics.org/  The problem with explaining reverse iconography (or iconography in general) is that it always involves some degree of guesswork and opinions can differ greatly (for example, I've come across four different interpretations for the FEL TEMP REPARATIO coins). If I had to explain this particular coin, I guess I'd link it to the Trojan myth in which Paris gave Aphrodite (Venus) the golden apple in return for the most beautiful woman on Earth, thus sparking the Trojan War. I wouldn't be surprised if others came up with different explanations, however."

I hoped there were some agreed upon explanations for the different types of reverses, but I guess I'll have to pick the one that I find the most likely.   I'm not very familiar with Hellenistic myths so this explanation never crossed my mind. Any theories about the significance of Venus ""drawing out fold of drapery""?

Although the only extended narrative from antiquity is that of Apuleius, Eros and Psyche appear in Greek art as early as the 4th century BC.

VENUS FELIX could also be read as ""the fruitfulness of Venus"", implying the Julia has been granted these ""fruits"" that Venus has. If you serve a certain god, or goddess, they can grant you their favors, so Julia serves Venus, and Venus grants fruitfulness and beauty to Julia."
AncientCoins,33t5w8,antiquarian_bookworm,4,Sat Apr 25 12:47:21 2015 UTC,"A couple things I'd like to mention...  Words like ""fortune"" and ""luck"" had a bit of a different meaning to people raised in the roman religion. We are raised to believe that random things can happen, and that we can somewhat influence the outcome of our own future by our own actions (free will), but that was unknown in roman culture. The gods determined everything. If you had good luck, it was a gift from Fortuna. Nothing is random. So when people translate felix as luck or fortune, romans would translate that as being gifted by the gods. That is why ""felix"" can also mean bounty, fruitfulness, and similar things. The multiple translations here are an attempt to hit on an ancient concept that is alien to us.  Another thing to consider is that if you are not used to translating languages, then you should be aware that words don't have a one-to-one correspondence of translation There isn't always one perfect word in english to represent a latin word. Add on top of that the difficulty of words sometimes having multiple meanings, depending on the context of the other words or images associated with them.  And to top it off, sometimes there are words in one language that do not exist in another language.   You people who know multiple languages are probably chuckling right now, because this is obvious to you, but realize that to other people unfamiliar with translation this is new information... not obvious. Only things you have seen and experienced before are obvious (paraphrase Thomas Edison).  So this explains why a sentence or phrase of latin might be translated differently by different people."
AncientCoins,33t5w8,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Sat Apr 25 15:44:14 2015 UTC,"That's very interesting. So the obverse text basically implies that Julia is gifted by the gods, or more specifically, Venus?   I actually speak 3 languages so I know the pain of translating some sentences between different languages, but I know zero Latin (or any Romance language for this matter) so I had to trust online sources for the (bad) translation. Do you have any advice on how to translate this sort of Latin in the future?"
AncientCoins,33t5w8,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Mon Apr 27 09:05:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, during this time the rulers claimed to receive their status by being favored or actually related to some of the gods. This type of coin shows which god is backing Julia. It demonstrated to the public her right to rule. Julius Caesar started this deification of the emperor and his family to consolidate his power, and that is why he was stabbed to death by Brutus. Brutus was trying to save the old republic notion that the leader was a public servant, and not a god. To hold rule after the time of Caesar, you had to choose a god and claim they wanted you to rule, and that tradition carried on through history right up to the the present day. English coins still say ""Rules by the Grace of God"" on them.  Anyway, you will find coins with emperors (or family members) and the the god that grants their power.  Another thing about latin is that it is an ancient and dead language, so you can't just call up a roman on the phone and discuss a translation, like you could with a modern language. The translations we have come from writings of the time, noticing how the word was used in that context at that time. Words change over time. Latin became so mangled by the late roman and early medieval period that people speaking latin had trouble speaking to each other if they came from different areas of the empire. This was the period of ""vulgar latin"". The Jesuit priests in the late medieval translated this vulgar latin into a uniform type that a lot of people call ""church latin"". So latin was translated into latin.  Anyway, you not only have to use a latin dictionary when doing the translation, you need to know when the word or phrase was used, and in what context, and knowing their culture helps to understand what THEY thought this meant."

AncientCoins,33rqcg,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Sat Apr 25 03:28:20 2015 UTC,"Mainly interested in Greek and roman coinage. Greek mainly for their gods and roman for their conquests. So Greek coins that depict their gods rather than rulers would be more interesting and for Roman it would be more for their famous war rulers. As for medieval history it would have to be the violence, wars, crusades, knights Templar, that sort of thing. I realize this is a broad couple of categories but I do not know much about ancients as I am just starting to get into it."

AncientCoins,33pz70,Sir-Rein,3,Fri Apr 24 15:34:23 2015 UTC,"Well this is a coin from the Gallo-Roman or Gallic empire, a breakaway empire that didn't last long but for a time encompassed parts of France, Spain, Portugal and Germany IIRC. Posthumus was the first emperor of this empire. That is pretty cool in and of itself.  Also, the antoninianus is a double denarius, worth two denarii. The Romans denoted this double value on coins using the radiate crown. In the time of Julius Caesar, the denarius was a silver coin of usually around 3.8-4 grams of very high purity silver. By this time, even the double denarius was a thin, light coin made of very low purity silver due to the debasement of the denarius. Nearly every emperor had debased the denarius in some way because soldiers always expected some huge bonus and raise once the new guy came into power but it had really sped up in the years shortly before this with the crisis of the third century in full swing.  Hope that helps. That should give you enough info to point you in the direction find out a lot more on this era. Unfortunately I can't help ylh much with actual day-to-day value. I'd also recommend checking out Mike Duncan's ""History of Rome"" podcast and skipping forward a bit to the episodes around this period(should be somewhere around episode 110 or 120 IIRC) if you have time."
AncientCoins,33pz70,Red_Spork,2,Fri Apr 24 15:54:38 2015 UTC,"Here's a good page about the value of roman money, and it has a series photo showing the sliding debasement of the antoninianus around this time period.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_currency  Roughly, a denarius weight of high grade silver was considered a days wage for an average worker, but it is hard to use that one data point across all the changes that were going on with the economy. The money is changing in silver weight and the food is changing in scarcity. I would guess that this coin at this time would be half a days wage of an average worker.  Kind of vague... sorry."
AncientCoins,33pz70,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Fri Apr 24 16:48:18 2015 UTC,Yeah it is a pretty hard question. My coin is a Furee coin right? Just a copper coin with a thin layer of silver.
AncientCoins,33pz70,Nikodeimos,3,Fri Apr 24 17:46:52 2015 UTC,"Postumus' coins often have spots like these on them. I don't see any reason to think it's a fourrée. All in all, it's a very nice coin!"
AncientCoins,33pz70,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Fri Apr 24 18:37:15 2015 UTC,"It doesn't look like a fourree, but if you look around the web you might find out more about this specific issue. Most fourrees I have and have seen have a lot of damage to the plate surface, and all I see on your coin is a couple dots. That is one immaculate coin."
AncientCoins,33pz70,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Fri Apr 24 17:58:37 2015 UTC,"If it is a fourree, then I would say it might be 1/10 of a day's wage. The romans tried to enforce the value of the debased money to be what was decreed, but the people would equate it to metal prices in an underground economy, so the worker is going to want more of those if the silver content has dropped to fourree levels."
AncientCoins,33pz70,SolarDub,2,Fri Apr 24 18:02:57 2015 UTC,"Are fourees general denarii, not antoninianii? Generally, fourees (the ones I've seen and own) are the former and have a lot of the silver plating missing, exposing the often corroded bronze beneath.  This antoninianus, however, looks gorgeous!"
AncientCoins,33pz70,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Fri Apr 24 18:20:42 2015 UTC,"No, the double denarius antoninianus was also made to be fourree during the inflation. Just like our pennies are actually tin now and the half dollar was silver, became clad silver (40%), and then finally became clad copper with no silver.   If the metal value outstrips the face value of the coin, people will hoard the old coinage, and sometimes melt it down, creating a coin shortage. That happened just lately when the price of copper shot way up and people started going through all the world circulating coins and pulling the high copper coins out to sell as metal. It created a temporary shortage of low denomination coins in many countries.  Will and Ariel Durant wrote some good, thick books on roman history about 70 years ago, and they have many details of the lives of the emperors, life during each reign, the politics, and economics. The neat thing about those books is that not only are they compendious and highly accurate, they are really cheap for the used volumes, because they were printed in relatively high volume. He also wrote a history of greece that is well respected (and cheap!).

AncientCoins,33pz70,SolarDub,2,Fri Apr 24 18:49:26 2015 UTC,"Then it's my definition of fouree, then. I'd always considered it to be a coin cladded with the intention to counterfeit, mainly denarii. I'd just considered the ants to be silver plated with no intention to deceive."
AncientCoins,33pz70,antiquarian_bookworm,3,Fri Apr 24 19:37:25 2015 UTC,"Fourree just means silver plated. There are official government ones and forger ones. Both of them don't hold up well over time. The corrosion sneaks up under the silver and carries it away. It's kind of disappointing when you are cleaning a fourree and little flakes of silver are falling off, but you haven't got it down far enough to see the features, so the silver ends up in the wash water. =-("
AncientCoins,33pz70,SolarDub,1 point,Fri Apr 24 19:57:27 2015 UTC,I was playing with (read: scribbing) a fouree just now. Green verdigris right on the portrait which doesn't bode well for any silvering underneath.
AncientCoins,33pz70,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Fri Apr 24 20:37:47 2015 UTC,"Yup, that usually means it goes through the plate and sometimes under the plate in the local area. Then it floats around in the wash. But, you do what you can, and you have to give up at a certain point, if you want to retain some of the silver. Then you have to be careful how you handle it.  Some people decide the coin under the fourree is good enough, and just clean it right down, blowing away the silver."
AncientCoins,33pz70,Red_Spork,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:22:02 2015 UTC,"Is it necessarily fouree if it is billon? The process used to ""plate"" actual imperial mint issues was to use a small amount if silver in the alloy then put the coin into a pickling solution IIRC. This left behind a thin layer of silver on the surface but there is still some inside as well, as you can see if you take a blowtorch to a slug."
AncientCoins,33pz70,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Fri Apr 24 20:15:33 2015 UTC,"Fouree = plated silver  Billion = low grade silver alloy  ""Pickled"" plated = a theory about how late roman coins were ""silvered"". It was noticed that the coins from the later roman empire seem to have a different method of silver plating than the ones from earlier times, plating that is so thin it is almost seems like an electroplating. Early theories about this type included electroplating, but nobody could prove it. It was also often called ""silver wash"", because another theory was that the flans were put in a silver nitrate solution and the silver precipitated out onto the copper. You can  make your own silver pennies that way. =-}. But recent evidence seems to suggest this ""pickling"" method might be the truth. The coin flan is make from very low grade silver alloy, then the bare flan is ""pickled"" in an acid that is selective for the copper, pulling it into solution, and leaving a mostly silver surface. Then the coin is struck, giving a very thin silver layer, thinner than a fourree plating. The ""evidience"" that this might be the technique used is that the unstruck part of the flans show signs of acid erosion.  If you have coins of low grade silver and they look like pretty pure copper after cleaning (a type of billion alloy), you can sometimes bring back the silverish look by just heating the coin on the burner of a stove. The silver has selectively eroded away, showing copper. Heating it drives the silver back to the surface. Only try this on coins that have a good solid flan. A corroded flan will crack.  So early plated coins are the ones that thin sheets of silver comes off in the wash. The suspected ""pickled"" plated coins are the ones that are so thin, they just wear away as you clean them. The romans left no known recipe for doing these things, so a lot of this info is by guessing."

From its introduction to the Republic, during the third century BC, well into Imperial times, Roman currency saw many changes in form, denomination, and composition.

(The episodes with Postumus start with episode 113.) This is a fantastic podcast if you are at all interested in Roman history and this particular part of the podcast was what got me as interested in the breakaway empire started by Postumus. My favorite thing about him was how he set up a copy of the Roman government in his empire, he wasn't a bad guy, he just wanted to defend his own land instead of going across the world to defend someone else's home.

AncientCoins,33o8rk,gordie44,2,Fri Apr 24 03:49:55 2015 UTC,Roman Sestertii are pretty large. Here's one of mine next to an ike dollar. Legit sestertii range in price from as low as about $20 for really low grade example to ~$100-$200 for nicer examples like this to thousands for some rare ones.
AncientCoins,33o8rk,Red_Spork,2,Fri Apr 24 03:39:58 2015 UTC,"Here's another larger one from my collection, a Tetradrachm of Alexander the great. This one ran $250 IIRC and there are worn examples as low as a hundred or so and also plenty of reproductions."
AncientCoins,33o8rk,Red_Spork,2,Fri Apr 24 03:46:48 2015 UTC,Third Reich silver Marks are also big. But I don't think coins with a swastika on it have a good aura for your public.
AncientCoins,33o8rk,kpgfisty,2,Fri Apr 24 11:56:06 2015 UTC,I'd use a replica if you are going to be flipping it around and possibly dropping it.
AncientCoins,33o8rk,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Fri Apr 24 12:15:11 2015 UTC,"A good place to purchase high-quality replica coins from is antiquanova.com.  They have a wide selection, in both silver (expensive) and tin (reasonable).  They clearly list the diameter of their coins.  They have several coins that are larger than a US half dollar.  It might be worthwhile to look in their 'Holy Land' category which features they Shekel of Tyre.  There are several ancient coins that figure in the Bible that could be interesting for magic tricks … e.g. turning a Widow's mite into 30 pieces of silver.  Antiquanova also sells reproduction Roman erotic tokens.  I could imagine tricks where a coin showing a particular sex act was turned into a coin with a different sex act.  Because many ancient coins are thick you might be able to do interesting things with them more easily than other coins.  However because they are inherently unfamiliar most people will have trouble following the trick.  I mean, for me, it would be amazing to see you turn a Julius Caesar coin into a Brutus coin.  I'm not sure this trick would be effective at a child's birthday party, though."
AncientCoins,33o8rk,esnible,1 point,Fri Apr 24 12:29:14 2015 UTC,They are probably too irregular and not impressive enough for your audience. A flashy fantasy coin will probably work better.
AncientCoins,33mmb0,iSmokeGauloises,2,Thu Apr 23 19:23:29 2015 UTC,"This two are the only ones from the lot I have no lead on. I haven't researched much, but got frustrated when I wasn't able to identify them quickly and thought you guys might shed some light on their story.  If it helps, all of the other coins have a SIS mintmark for Siscia, so I bet this two are from the same area.   Thanks!"
AncientCoins,33mmb0,Red_Spork,3,Thu Apr 23 19:25:41 2015 UTC,"The bust on the big one looks like Trajan. Reverse kinda reminds me of Roma holding victory and spear.  The other one looks like divus Constantine to me, possibly. I will look a bit more when I get home from work in a few hours."
AncientCoins,33mmb0,jojo32,3,Thu Apr 23 19:30:50 2015 UTC,"I was thinking Nerva due to the lack of beard, but it's possible it just wore off.    The other one looks like divus Constantine to me, possibly. I will look a bit more when I get home from work in a few hours.   Just googled it an it is in fact Divus Constantine, with ""Constantine veiled & standing right"" on the reverse. Can't figure out a mint mark from this one, but I think it might be CONS of Constantinople.   Thanks for the help!"
AncientCoins,33mmb0,Red_Spork,3,Thu Apr 23 19:46:15 2015 UTC,Yep certainly divus Constantine. I think these were minted after his death (commemorative).
AncientCoins,33mmb0,jojo32,5,Thu Apr 23 19:53:42 2015 UTC,"Divus/diva in Latin indicates deified, so any ""divus X"" coins are posthumous, memorial-type issues of X, divus being for males and diva for females."

AncientCoins,33mmb0,pmstacker,3,Fri Apr 24 04:53:32 2015 UTC,Mine is the chariot reverse reaching his hand to God. Pretty sweet!

AncientCoins,33ey2z,jajorda2,7,Tue Apr 21 23:44:22 2015 UTC,"Not a denarius, an antoninianus(a double denarius). Nice coin though. A Gordian III I won in a contest was the first nicer Roman coin I ever owned and it's still one of my favorites in my collection even though I own several rarer, more expensive coins."
AncientCoins,33ey2z,Red_Spork,5,Tue Apr 21 23:48:34 2015 UTC,"An answer I've never been able to pin down definitively has been why some emperors had such amazing quality in their coins versus others. Gordian III is definitely an emperor that can be had in quality silver for an affordable price.   He's seriously the emperor I absolutely recommend for those trying to find nice silver, cheap Romans.   This one is no exception. Well done! I'm trying to upgrade my Gordian though I think I'll always keep my first because it was what got me into Roman silvers in the first place."
AncientCoins,33ey2z,GeneralAgrippa,4,Wed Apr 22 02:32:54 2015 UTC,"I believe the three major influences on coin quality of the roman empire are:   Enforcement of mint standards. Mints would start to economize (or steal coin metal) and the quality would slide. At certain periods they had to send the army out to enforce mint standards. Some emperors were strict on monetary standards enforcement, and others just let it run.  Economics of the times. Flan sizes and quality of metal slip as the number of coins is increased for inflation and the engravers have less time to crank out more dies.  Stability of the empire. At some periods of high stress, you find what seems to be ""I don't care"" coinage at some mints. Seems like the rules are no longer enforced.  That's why I don't get too bothered about a coin that is poorly minted. It is often a reflection of the times it comes from."
AncientCoins,33ey2z,antiquarian_bookworm,3,Wed Apr 22 12:17:39 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty good summary! The only things I can add is that some emperors deliberately debased the coinage to turn a profit (Nero for example) and of course sources of precious metals could be depleted, which according to some researchers was the case in northern Spain in the 3rd century."
AncientCoins,33ey2z,Nikodeimos,2,Wed Apr 22 18:37:51 2015 UTC,"Amazing quality depends on what you compare it to, of course. Coming in around 40% fineness, Gordian III's antoniniani are pretty good compared to Claudius Gothicus' strongly reduced antoniniani, but pale in comparison to say denarii of Marcus Aurelius at ~80% fineness."
AncientCoins,33ey2z,Nikodeimos,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:51:39 2015 UTC,"I think he was just talking about the fact that higher-grade antoniniani of Gordian III are so plentiful, not so much the metal quality itself."
AncientCoins,33ey2z,Red_Spork,2,Wed Apr 22 18:55:39 2015 UTC,"Ah, in that case I think it's mainly due to the hoarding pattern. Since the antoniniani became so bad from Gallienus onwards (with gradual decreases already under Aemilian), I think people decided to hold on to their older antoniniani of decent silver like those of Gordian III and Philippus and preferred the reduced pieces for day to day transactions."
AncientCoins,33ey2z,Nikodeimos,2,Wed Apr 22 19:02:20 2015 UTC,Interesting. That actually makes a lot of sense. I had read about how that was the reasoning for so many Mark Antony denarii being as worn as they are compared to others of the time.
AncientCoins,33ey2z,Red_Spork,2,Wed Apr 22 19:09:05 2015 UTC,"Exactly! If I had to choose between buying my bread with a crappy silver coin or a decent silver coin if the shopkeeper accepted (or was forced to accept) both, I'd know what to pick."
AncientCoins,33ey2z,Nikodeimos,2,Wed Apr 22 19:17:34 2015 UTC,That's a really nice coin! Are you going to keep it slabbed?

AncientCoins,33ew4y,lacedaimon,3,Tue Apr 21 23:28:12 2015 UTC,"A quiz for the correct RIC number would just lead to people copying numbers from Wildwinds and similar, hoping they're correct.

AncientCoins,33ew4y,ghsgjgfngngf,1 point,Wed Apr 22 07:23:30 2015 UTC,"You have a good point. I wouldn't give any info on the coin other than it being Roman for example. The participants would have to research the coin themselves, and that would require looking them up from scratch so to speak. Even if it's copy and pasted, they would still need to look the coin up, and that's something that everyone can do, though some are better than others at it.  I'm still working on ideas. Last one i did, I posted a pic of a coin with King Midas on it, without saying who it was. It was a unique coin so there was really no way of looking it up. There were many guesses, and to my astonishment someone actually got it!  I sent him a really nice, near EF sestertius of Gordian III (or maybe it S. Alexander, something like that!

I have a couple of nice, EF coins set aside (nothing too extraordinary, but still nice coins), and I want to have some sort of contest.  If you guys have any ideas, let me know and I'll get pics up of the coin(s) that the winner of the contest(s) would win on /r/AncientCoins   It will be for subscribers, mods and dealers not applicable, as I think it's only fair.   I'll start the contest tonight if a decent idea is proposed. There is no catch, and shipping will be free, as will the coin. Just need an idea that will make it fair for everyone. Thanks!!!

AncientCoins,33ew4y,EvilCartyen,5,Tue Apr 21 23:35:39 2015 UTC,"Amazing coins as usual. That Sicilian Tetradrachm is really really beautiful. Alfred had mentioned you bought some cool coins there.  The first ID contest was fun. Maddening, but fun. Another like that would be cool. Or maybe something slightly less obscure but more technical like ""ID the catalog number"".  Also a ""spot the fake and explain why"" contest could be really fun plus a good exercise for all involved.  That's all that comes to mind for now. I'll edit this if I can think of any more cool ones."

AncientCoins,33bx8j,EvilCartyen,3,Tue Apr 21 07:16:54 2015 UTC,"These are not pure silver so this was a part of the coin that had a patina that the chemical cleaning didn't take off. New finds are often brutally cleaned in bulk. If you do anything, try to treat only that part of the coin, e.g. by applying a few drops of lemon juice and trying if the green goes soft and can be scraped away with a wooden toothpick. If this works, you'll end up with a pit like the other two that are on the reverse, i.e. a grey-coloured pit. You will not gain any detail but the coin will look more uniform, if it works."
AncientCoins,33bx8j,ghsgjgfngngf,2,Tue Apr 21 08:03:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not looking to gain detail, merely to stop corrosion from continuing. If there's no danger of that, I'll just leave it."
AncientCoins,33bx8j,ghsgjgfngngf,2,Tue Apr 21 08:10:25 2015 UTC,These coins can develop bronze disease but this is not bronze disease.
AncientCoins,33bx8j,antiquarian_bookworm,3,Tue Apr 21 09:15:52 2015 UTC,"It's a mixture of verdigris (green) and silver oxide (black). It is benign, so if it doesn't bother you, then you don't have to bother it. =-}  I'm not a silver collector, but don't most silver people like to have their coins totally striped? If that is true, then you might want to take it off with the mild acid and tooth pick.  And in eight years it should turn dark. It looks like it is still ""raw"" from fresh cleaning.  Nice coin."
AncientCoins,33bx8j,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Tue Apr 21 11:47:41 2015 UTC,"Cool if it's not aggressive. I don't know what most people do, since this is a personal project for me, collecting ancients. I have no fixed idea about what I like on a silver coins, toning-wise.  But a choice between pitted and corroded, well, none of them are particularly appealing :D  And thank you :)"
AncientCoins,33bx8j,Numismatic,1 point,Tue Apr 21 11:58:58 2015 UTC,"I hate suggesting metal tools to a beginner, but to make the acid treatment less aggressive you can take an exacto knife and thin the verdigris down, to lessen the amount of time the acid has to work. You take the tip of the knife and use circular motions with light pressure to wear the verdigris down. When you get close to the coin, you let the acid do the delicate work.  The reason I warn against starting with metal tools for beginners is because as you work down you may not know where the coin will appear, so it is common to go too far and scratch it. The scratch from a steel blade can be hard to get rid of, and usually involves buffing the whole coin to produce a smooth surface. Because steel scratches go deep, you have to buff pretty far, and then the coin looks buffed =-}. Circular scratches are less noticeable than linear scratches. Sometimes you get down to just letting the weight of the knife handle be the only pressure.  Learning tricks like that is best done on a coin that you care the least about.  Personally, being a bronze collector, I have no issues with verdigris. But I see frantic comments from silver collectors at the smallest dot of verdigris, so their idea of beauty seems to be different. I think they become silver collectors because they can't stand the sight of corrosion. (my theory)"
AncientCoins,33bx8j,antiquarian_bookworm,3,Tue Apr 21 13:40:41 2015 UTC,I'd leave it.  It's no longer causing harm and provides a bit of history.

AncientCoins,33bx8j,lacedaimon,3,Wed Apr 22 11:49:16 2015 UTC,"There is one way it can be done if you really want to remove it. Personally I wouldn't touch it, but if you have to then here's how it's done:  You'll need either vinegar or lemon juice and a small piece of aluminum foil.  Use a dripper or something to cover the black area without getting it on the rest of the coin.  Once that area has the juice on it, take a piece of aluminum foil, and carefully press it over the black area. You should keep your finger down on it, and you will feel it warming up, and a foul smell will be emitted.  Remove the foil, wipe the area of with a cotton swab dipped in lemon juice or vinegar. Repeat over and over until it comes off.  It's a tedious job, I know. I've done it hundreds of times. Do not use sharp tools to try and remove it, you'll damage the coin, unless you can pick at it from underneath at the edge then lift the corrosion off the coin.   I would recommend leaving it as it is. Billon coins are one of the biggest pain in the ass to deal with unless they're in a good state of preservation."

AncientCoins,33bx8j,lacedaimon,1 point,Tue Apr 21 21:10:42 2015 UTC,"No need to worry, it won't spread. Most likely the entire coin was coated with what looks to be horn-silver, but I could be wrong, and that area was just more stubborn, and probably thicker than it was on the rest of the coin.  It's always great to have any coin of Galba, and I'm sure you're happy to have it. Congratulations!  I picked up a few really nice coins at the CICF a couple of weeks ago, and I think I might show a couple of them off on /r/ancientcoins!   I haven't posted here in a long time. I've been swamped with emails and coins to clean, but things are finally settling down."
AncientCoins,336q6c,butteredfatkid,7,Mon Apr 20 01:37:24 2015 UTC,"If you want to buy cleaned coins, there is no need to buy them from uncleaned coin sellers. They'll probably be more expensive. You can buy from any established dealer, eg on Vcoins. This is just a random example of Byzantine coins:  http://www.vcoins.com/en/stores/walter_holts_old_money/118/product/group_lot_special_byzantine_bronze_coins__lots_of_ten_10/206187/Default.aspx  Or you can get some recommendations of good Ebay sellers. Cheap coins suitable for a beginner, especially Romans are best bought on Ebay but ONLY if you know the seller. I don't buy on Ebay US, so I can't recommend anyone. Buying from Ebay randomly as a new collector is a recipe for disaster.   This lot is perfect for a beginner: http://www.ebay.com/itm/Lot-of-10-Higher-Grade-Uncleaned-AE4-Smaller-Roman-Bronze-Coins-w-Desert-Patina-/231537188118?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item35e8b11d16  I would try to get if for $20-$25. That's reasonable and if you don't get it for that, there are plenty of fish in the sea. The other offers of this seller don't seem particularly attractive(ly priced).  Here's another good seller.  http://www.ebay.com/sch/holding_history/m.html  Always be careful with fixed price offers. Just because a dealer is honest and reputable, does not mean that all their coins are reasonably priced. Always look around and compare prices.  Same as with uncleaneds, don't buy unless you see a picture of the actual coins you'll be receiving. Many sellers, for different reasons, don't update their pictures so the photo of the lot your coins are selected from may be years old and not reflect what you're getting at all.   Buying bulk lots of cheap unidentified coins is a very good way to start the hobby, as long as you're careful."

I removed some of the dirt with toothpicks after soaking but the dirt that is left resembles cement. As for the ratio, I was thinking the same.

AncientCoins,332pbx,NomenStulti,3,Sun Apr 19 02:19:32 2015 UTC,"Coins were a common propoganda tool, so whoever was in charge at the time put on his coins what he thought was important. For example Julian (the last pagan emperor) had a lot of pagan symbols on his coins.   As far as the obverse goes, the general formula is the emperor's name - in this case CONSTANTINUS, along with a few titles. Here we have IMP - Imperator (commander). PF, which I have already explained. and AVG - Augustus, the title which signified the imperal office above all others. Augustus basically equates to our modern understanding of the words ""Roman Emperor."" Titles vary from coin to coin, emperor to emperor, and dynasty to dynasty.

They were bordered by the Corieltauvi to the west, and the Catuvellauni and Trinovantes to the south. The tribe turned into a civitas during the Roman occupation of Britannia. Their capital was Venta Icenorum, located at modern-day Caistor St Edmund.  During the Roman occupation, the Roman Emperor assigned officials to transform the tribes into civitates as a way to govern them.   The Iceni was one of roughly sixteen civitates in Britain  The Romans’ increasing influence eventually led to the Iceni uprising in 61 A.D.  Julius Caesar described the Cenimagni submitting to him during his second expedition to Britain in 54 BC: the Cenimagni may have been a branch of the Iceni  or it could be a corruption of Eceni Magni meaning ""Great Eceni"".

Wildwinds is a site of coins that were sold a long time ago, and have been scrutinized by many experts. Take a look at this page of many Constantine I types that have been cataloged.  http://www.wildwinds.com/coins/ric/constantine/t.html  During this time, early 4th century, the romans occupied england and had a mint in London, which they called Londinium. A hundred years later, the ""barbarians"" close the noose on the roman empire and the romans leave england to the saxon invasion.  The ""exergue"" is a small area on the bottom of the reverse of the coin that romans would normally put some markings to show the place the coin was minted. Your coin says ""PLN"", indicating Londinium. I'm not sure what the ""P"" is doing in there, but it is well documented they used a ""P"". Some other coins from Londinium say ""LON"" on them, but those are a different type.  The ""S"" and ""F"" letters on both sides of the god Sol indicate the ""offiica"", which is some markings indicating something about the type of coin, some catalog system used by the romans. I don't know a lot about officias, and other people might chime in to explain that more.

I don't get too obsessed with that type of thing (actually, I ignore it). I'm more interested in the history and politics and what the coin represents in time. It's a window into an ancient culture, and sort of like a book marker.   Some collectors are very concerned with those types of things, and make it a major objective to collect every type, mint, officina, etc. That's where a mint mark or officina can make a type suddenly worth a lot more or less. I like to know the mint location, but it isn't going to make or break a coin for me. The officina is even less important to me.  To each his own... =-}"

AncientCoins,330qtk,Nikodeimos,2,Sat Apr 18 16:57:26 2015 UTC,"The roman concept of religion is hard for modern people to understand, because most of the world is now one of the monotheistic religions (christian, jew, muslim). The romans believed in many gods, and the more the merrier. One of the first things they would do when contacting another culture was to find out who their gods were, and then try to figure out if it was a new god they didn't know, or a different name for one of the ""known"" gods. Since pleasing gods brought favors in life, figuring this all out was important to having a good life. Romans also lived in fear of accidentally displeasing some god and getting punished, so priests were government bureaucratic scholars who studied gods, and how to please them, and received government money to make the gods happy. Unhappy gods could crush the empire.  There was a big clash when the romans met the jews, because monotheism seemed to threaten the other gods, and likely displease them. Both sides saw what the other was saying as being blasphemy that could bring revenge from their god (gods).   Constantine had to deal with that issue.  He wanted to adopt jesus into the roman pantheon of gods, but the early christians were abhorred by the idea."

AncientCoins,330qtk,jojo32,2,Sat Apr 18 17:02:03 2015 UTC,"Coins that are buried in acidic soil with a lot of moisture end up with a lot of corrosion on them. On english coins the corrosion can go so deep that the whole coin is corroded through and through, but you can still get a ""coin"" out of it because as the corrosion was happening, it formed a shell that still retains the image of the coin. The whole coin is green patina, all the way through. I've had them break in half in my hands before. England is mostly acidic clay. They aren't all that bad, but english coins have a reputation of being frustrating to clean. There are other areas like near Dover that have large marine limestone deposits, so I imagine that the preservation conditions would be different in that area, and other limestone areas with a high pH might have a different state of preservation.  On the other hand, desert environments normally have ""dirt"" that is actually powderized silica sand, as opposed to the clay ""dirt"". Silica sand is very neutral pH, and the mineral content of the sand can often be alkaline, which is high pH, low acid. Coins in arid, sandy, alkaline areas often can come out of the ground with very little corrosion and almost in the condition they were lost thousands of years ago, just with a stubborn shell of powderized sand on them, which adds protection against abrasion.  Spain has both low, acid, moist regions and high desert plains. I've cleaned spanish coins from both types of regions. The high plains region has a dirt color very must like the residue stuff on your coin. I've found some nicely preserved late roman bronze coins in immaculate condition from the high spanish desert, similar to what you have.  There are other desert areas, of course. There are deserts in africa that it might be from, and also the middle east. But the reason I would bet on spain is because the level of commerce between spain and england at that time was quite high.   Also, when I clean a group of coins I print out a map and plot the area each coin was from (if possible to know) and end up with a scatter diagram of where the coins where collected. The center of the cluster is normally where they were imported from (but I do find some odd-balls). So... I find that usually the coins are within a 500 mile radius of where they were minted. So roman coins from the miiddle east often come from the eastern part of the roman empire, and roman coins from the desert of spain normally come from the west (like germany, england, france, rome, a cluster like that).

AncientCoins,330qtk,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Sat Apr 18 17:39:14 2015 UTC,"Two important things where happening in the roman empire at about the time of that coin. I mentioned the one of the roman empire becoming christian, but also the seat of power of the roman empire was moved from rome to Constantinople (modern day Istanbul).  This was a time of great change and instability in the empire, and Constantine I was a powerful ruler who took the bull by the horns and tried to stabilize it. Thus the title ""Constantine the Great"".  Makes you want to learn more about that time, doesn't it? Movies are a cool way to study history, but some of the movies warp the true history a bit to make it more palatable to general audiences. Still, a fun way to ""study""."
AncientCoins,330qtk,jojo32,3,Sat Apr 18 17:55:55 2015 UTC,Hi-jacking this. I ID'd this as RIC VII 10.
AncientCoins,32wrcr,p4rus,2,Fri Apr 17 10:36:29 2015 UTC,"Your ID is correct. You'll notice that two of the coins (indeed crappy) are unsold. They'll probably remain unsold at these prices for many years. These coins are not incredibly rare, nor are they valuable enough to warrant picking them from uncleaned lots. They appear rarer than they are, because in most auction archives you won't find many Late Romans. There are a lot of coins that are much more common than this one but appear scarce to rare, because a quick search might only turn up a few examples.  But despite all that, it's a nice enough coin, certainly in collectible condition! The middlemen and uncleaned sellers sifting through these uncleaned lots pull out all the good coins, ie. those that are in very good condition. They generally don't recognize scarce variants. They will recognize popular and interesting types but this probably wouldn't register to them as being one of these things."
AncientCoins,32wrcr,ghsgjgfngngf,2,Fri Apr 17 10:53:31 2015 UTC,"They appear rarer than they are, because in most auction archives you won't find many Late Romans.   Ahh, and there's the logical explanation I needed! Makes perfect sense, thanks. I'm just glad I got the ID right. I suppose if you've enough coins for sale, or are running a coin selling business alongside a 9-5, perhaps it doesn't hurt to ask ridiculous prices and only make one or two sales a month...   Not that it will happen, but to get an indication of the mark-up, care to guess what mine might on Ebay? I'm guessing seriously low, just by virtue of people not knowing it's perhaps a slightly unusual variant?  And any insight on my mint question? The Tesorillo link suggests it's either Heraclea or Cyzicus. Any way to tell without a visible exergue?"
AncientCoins,32wrcr,ghsgjgfngngf,2,Fri Apr 17 11:15:16 2015 UTC,"That's really hard to tell. Late Roman coins are not very popular. Many collectors look down on them, probably because they're so common and comparatively small. I have (against my will) sold very nice Late Romans for just a couple of dollars, I find prices for them very unpredictable.   Professional dealers can't offer low-value coins cheaply, they have costs and overhead but still, those coins are very, very expensive.  As for the mint, I can't help there either. It takes some specialized knowledge if the mint mark isn't visible. Unfortunately, it also makes it harder to sell Late Romans if they can't be identified completely."
AncientCoins,32wrcr,SolarDub,2,Fri Apr 17 11:33:03 2015 UTC,"Many collectors look down on them   This isn't a gripe with what you say, on the contrary. But, such is the snobbery with some people. For collectors who aren't stuck up or don't have 4 figure sums to spend on one coin, then late romans are perfectly collectable because they are so accessible."
AncientCoins,32wrcr,ghsgjgfngngf,4,Fri Apr 17 16:26:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying they're right or wrong to do so but they do. I myself buy the occasional Late Roman coin, especially because they're often so cheap, even in really nice condition. But I wouldn't collect them, because I think there's not enough variaion to keep me interested. But I think the same about other types of ancient coins as well. Show me a few nice denarii and I will enjoy them but show me a collection of 100 denarii in extremely fine condition and I will have a hard time keeping my eyes open if I have to look at them all."
AncientCoins,32wrcr,SolarDub,4,Fri Apr 17 16:50:33 2015 UTC,"I think the fact that we can have varying interests is part of the fun. I like to see what others collect, even if it's wide variation across the eras or a more concentrated collection.  I have a friend who used to collect Kraftwerk records and he would buy the same record regularly. The only differences were generally the covers, but, sometimes only down to the small print of the country of release. That stuff fascinates me."

The first coin has some detail on the obverse, but I can't make out anything identifiable.  The reverse is pretty strange, consisting of raised circles and crescents.  The second coin looks to be roman judging from the obverse, but I've tried entering fragments of the legend into databases and haven't come up with anything yet.  I probably am entering wrong letters.  More cleaning should make it more legible.  What interested me about this coin was the reverse, which I haven't seen before.    antiquarian_bookworm, hopefully this type of gallery works for you.  edit: here's the last image flipped with added contrast.  I'm not sure which way is up.  In one orientation, I think I can make out some roman letters, but in the other orientation I can make out some hebrew letters (gimmel, nun, and a weird shin)."
AncientCoins,32t1h8,ghsgjgfngngf,2,Thu Apr 16 14:17:53 2015 UTC,"The second is from Nicaea in Bithynia. It's a very common coin. Probably Severus Alexander. The first looks interesting but I can't tell what it is. But it might be something obscure, not classic Roman or Greek. It doesn't take 2000 years to form a green patina."

AncientCoins,32t1h8,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Thu Apr 16 23:55:50 2015 UTC,I just looked at the Gorgon and Medusas and they don't seem to match the crescent and circle patterns.   This pattern seemingly continues over the whole coin (though an area is worn down).  These seem to be a pattern of symbols.  Here's a ancient celtic coin with raised circles and a crescent that I just found.  http://www.wildwinds.com/coins/celtic/britain/iceni/VA_610.jpg

Also it seems as if this pattern is taking up most of the coin - where would the face fit in?  Also, how do you suggest I proceed with cleaning?  Most of the dirt (except that one chunk), has already been taken off.  Is the green layer the patina?  It almost has a rock-like texture/feeling to it."
AncientCoins,32t1h8,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Fri Apr 17 02:18:58 2015 UTC,"It always helps to know what you are cleaning, when you come down to the finish line of cleaning. It gives you clues on what you need to remove and what you might nick.  Speaking of celtic mimics, I have a Iberian celt coin that is a mimic of Greek Zeus that is all hair, hardly any face. =-} It might be that it is a celt mimic of a greek gorgon, and they just went nuts with the hair.  On image 1, is that a chunk of stuff on the surface, or is that darkness that is down to the bronze?  I would try to do a two-tone finish on that first coin, using a dremel with soft cotton wheel to only buff the high points. It looks like the high points will turn a beautiful shade of aqua green and there will be a light dirt color for the background color.  The second coin I would soak and lightly brush with a long bristle brass brush. Use a light touch, don't dig into it. You are trying to smooth out that patina. It has a complex patina with the green vertigis and the red stuff. The red stuff normally is sitting right on the bronze, and sometimes digs holes into the bronze. You normally have the options of trying to smooth the red stuff out, and go with the green/red mottled look, or dig the red stuff out, and let it go to green and browned bronze.  Clean lightly and slowly with that second one, to tell which way seems best for it as it evolves."

Yeah I'm going to take the second coin slowly, as it seems quite fragile"
AncientCoins,32t1h8,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Fri Apr 17 02:58:34 2015 UTC,"Those low relief coins is where a two-tone method really can pay off, if you can do it. Otherwise you have low relief on a monotone, and you can only see it when the light strikes it tangentially. First try the two tone, and if that botches up, then you have to clean it down the best the coin will allow.  To get an idea what the two tone can do for the coin, dry the coin thoroughly, make your finger tip damp, then touch the high points, and see what it might look like.  Sometimes the cotton buffing isn't enough, so you have to use the toothpick and soak method, using the broken toothpick to buff the surface crud off the high points. Tedious work, but good results on some coins.  Some people try to cheat with the two tone method, and end up ""drawing"" features that really aren't there. That is something to watch out for when buying a coin. The scrubber was pushing his luck by putting things on the coin that should be there, but aren't."
AncientCoins,32t1h8,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Fri Apr 17 03:06:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah when I'm trying to see whats on the coin, I use that exact method of getting the high points damp.  Is there any method other than using a dremel?  I can see how the dremel would be nice as you can barely put pressure on the high points and still get nice buffing.  My dremel is at my parents house 2,000 miles away and I probably shouldn't buy a new one."

Recent research by Catharine Lorber suggests that Svoronos  categorized this series incorrectly.

Pretty awesome.  I would just go ahead and clean your coins and see what you got (and show us some pics along the way)."

What you look to have gotten is mostly late Roman AE3s and AE4s, which is very common when buying uncleaned coins, especially at the price point you paid. You can easily pay $5, $10, $20 or more per coin if you want larger coins with enough detail to identify. That said, you look to have received coins with good detail that could clean up into a nice collection of late Romans at a decent price point for what you got.  Also, don't completely write off small ancients. I have many that are 15mm or less, in fact I'm quite a fan of them, and they can be some really interesting coins to collect. I have 3 rarer tiny Ptolemaic Greek coins coming in this week from CNG actually."

I'm still trying to research these coins, so any knowledge about them would be appreciated!  The other coins in the album are from an ebay lot.  I should have heeded people's advice to never buy ""uncleaned"" ancients from ebay.  Many were already scrubbed down, many were just fragments, and most have absolutely no detail.  Still cleaning a lot of dirt off from most of the lot, but most look like slugs.  I was wondering if you guys knew what type of coins they are?

But, I'm really interested in the owlish critter. One possibility is that it is a mimic of the Athenian owl. A lot of smaller countries mimicked the greek owl in the BC period to add status to their coinage. The thickness you mention makes me think greek influence.  Early Judean YEHUD owl...  http://www.google.com/search?q=judean+owl+coin+YEHUD&btnG=Search&hl=en&gbv=1&tbm=isch  Another possibility is that it is a barbaric imitation, not an official coinage of any government...  http://www.google.com/search?q=barbaric+imitation+owl+coin&btnG=Search&hl=en&gbv=1&tbm=isch  Another possibility is that it is a fat eagle. Some of the eagles I've seen are pretty bad, and resemble chickens. Some possibilities are Seleucid or Ptolemaic eagles. Also, there are barbaric imitations of those eagles. All of those would be thick coins, because they are of greek influence."

It has a distinct  round head and large, round eyes.  I looked at your suggestions and unfortunately they don't match.  This owl is different from most of the owl coins I found on google, as it seems to be posed directly out of the plane of the coin (most owls have the body facing to the right and the head looking directly out of the plane).  Also,the owl is situated on the far left side of the reverse.  The only detail left on the obverse are the braille-like dots which lined the  perimeter of the coin.  The coin is slightly smaller than a dime.  Thanks for the suggestions.  Hopefully you can check the images out for yourself soon!"

AncientCoins,3208xi,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Fri Apr 10 01:12:42 2015 UTC,"On the second image (that doesn't have the owl), rotate it 180 degrees and you will see a helmeted Athena. One trick with these coins is to slowly rotate the coin and watch for something to pop out at you.  In my opinion this coin is an ancient cast fake of an Ionian coin, catalog number BMC 50. The owl is off center, and that is why he is shoved off to the left instead of centered where he should be. The reason I think it is a cast fake is because there is a sprue on the upper right of the owl image, and because the shape of the flan looks wrong for a BMC 50, and because the excess metal on both sides looks like a casting error rather than typical corrosion.  A sprue is a piece of metal that sticks out from the coin and is an artifact of casting. I've seen sprues like that on some real Ptolemaic and Judean coins, but not on these greek Ionian coins. Sprues on some coins are not signs of the coin being cast, they are part of the manufacturing process of the blank flan. So presence of a sprue is not evidence of the whole coin being cast, but in this case I don't think there should be a sprue.   Also, the shape of the flan is pie shaped, not like what Ionians made at all.  So, it is a fake, but an ancient one from about 150 to 120 B.C. I really like it."

I also thought it looked cast.  On every coin that I have handled, going from obverse to reverse means flipping the coin about its x-axis.  However, this coin flips along its y axis (which is why it is upside down in the photo).  Is this a mistake of the counterfeiter?"
AncientCoins,3208xi,H_L_Mencken,2,Fri Apr 10 02:10:16 2015 UTC,"Some cultures had a tradition of obverse to reverse orientation, and others just didn't care about orientation. I don't know if Ionia had a tradition or not, but you are right in thinking that could be another clue. You would need to study what orientations they might have used.  The technology of the flan reminds me of their neighbors to the south, in the middle east. That pie shape is very characteristic of Judean and Ptolemaic coins of the time. That makes me think the forgers were middle eastern."

It is $12 because there are tens of thousands of them on the market; larger than the number of people who would collect that particular coin.
AncientCoins,31b9w6,esnible,3,Fri Apr 3 14:43:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Fortunately I'm not very interested in rarity, more in having an interesting coin.  A quick follow up question: Are all the coins on the website (ancientimports) owned by the same person? If so, where did he get them?"
AncientCoins,31b9w6,Red_Spork,2,Fri Apr 3 14:52:21 2015 UTC,"Marc at AncientImports doesn't own them all: he also does consignments. As far as where he got them all there's really no telling, you'd have to ask him and it would be different for each coin.

What's funny is the rarity rating. With this seller, 5 is the baseline value, i.e. the most common coin will still be a 5 on his made-up scale. But he's a good dealer."

The patina is missing, both on the Caracalla Thessalian mint piece, and the Faustina Jr. As.   If you really wanted to dig deeper, get some citric acid, and mix it in with distilled water. It'll remove the darker layers, and expose the metal, but it won't look much better than it already does. You did a good job."
AncientCoins,318pfy,lacedaimon,2,Fri Apr 3 05:17:52 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, How can you tell that the patina is missing?"
AncientCoins,318pfy,lacedaimon,2,Fri Apr 3 13:32:33 2015 UTC,"The patina forms in layers, sometimes it is even and uniform, other times, depending on the method of cleaning, the patina can have one layer showing on parts of the coin and a different layer on other parts.  In the case of these two coins, it appears they never had a solid formation of patina. When a patina does form it forms a sort of shell around the coin, this usually preserves the detail of the coin to a much better extent.  You can see that these coins do not have the sharp detail, they are sort of a shadow of the original coin, and in the case of the coin on the left, Caracalla, the metal is eroded and this has caused the metal to be eaten away at. The Faustina may have had a patina, because it looks fairly uniform, but it was probably weak and came off during cleaning.  Keep in mind that ""crusty"" coins are usually selected for the trait of having no patina. A well-preserved coin with a solid patina isn't very difficult to clean, and they cost a premium if you can find them.  I've been cleaning coins for a long time, and have cleaned tens of thousands of them. It's what I do for a living! Thanks for asking, and I hope this helps."

I like knowing what the coin says in a cultural manner, like why is the emperor on that horse, crushing somebody under the hooves? =-} what's that all about? When this coin was minted in the reign of Probus, what was the political situation and who could that victim be in reference to? What is Probus trying to tell people with this symbol? Remember the vast majority of people couldn't read, so the images were intended to send political messages to the populace. That's the type of things I think about.  There are some people who get obsessed with collecting every possible issue from every possible mint, so you might find an obscure mint mark is valuable to somebody.

No reason any of these would be fake, so you have that going for you. You're paying just over a dollar apiece for these, so that is reasonable.  For that price you'll have a fair number that are unattributable/corroded beyond recognition/broken, but that comes with the territory. You'll likely have your hands full in terms of cleaning and attributing but it looks like you did well! Don't get overwhelmed haha!"

AncientCoins,30q8aq,Red_Spork,3,Mon Mar 30 00:36:27 2015 UTC,"I wish I remember which seller it was, but it was one I randomly found a few years back that had high reviews.  It was my first foray into uncleaned ancient coins, but I got a lot of 3. After I cleaned them, one was a Procopius, and the other was from Thrace, Mesembria.  I haven't really bought lots since back then, but I really should now. I had a blast cleaning them up!"
AncientCoins,30q8aq,ghsgjgfngngf,3,Mon Mar 30 01:05:18 2015 UTC,"In general, you are right. You're usually lucky to break even with uncleaned lots. Even if you found enough good coins to make a little bit of money the time spent likely makes it not worth it. It is possible to find interesting coins though and have fun. It is also possible to pay for quality and get quality uncleaned coins that you can make money off of, but they aren't cheap at all, like $10+ each.  Part of the reason you can get them cheaper than a cleaned coin, and this is especially true for high dollar uncleaned coins, is that there is labor involved cleaning them and also cleaning isn't easy and it's possible to fuck it all up and ruin a beautiful coin."
AncientCoins,30q8aq,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Mon Mar 30 04:05:01 2015 UTC,"These are not coins you can sell after cleaning. These are very low-grade Late Roman Coins, left over after 10 people have sifted through the finds. That's fine, because they were cheap. Even if you are an expert at cleaning, which most people are not and an expert wouldn't 'waste' his time on these, you could not make a profit selling the cleaned coins. Late Romans are hard to sell, even in 'very fine' condition, without cleaning scratches. Coins that are 'cleaned', i.e. have scratches, damaged patinas etc. will not sell for more than a dollar, if they sell at all.  If you know this, you can have fun cleaning and identifying these coins. If you think you can make money, you'll only be disappointed.  The vast majority of coin sellers, small Ebay sellers and large auction houses, manipulate photos of coin lots by putting the bad ones at the bottom and selecting a few good ones to put on top. This is something you always have to take into account but these pictures look good. I think you'll get what you paid for and this looks like one of the better uncleaned sellers."
AncientCoins,30q8aq,ghsgjgfngngf,1 point,Mon Mar 30 04:22:13 2015 UTC,"People who don't clean coins and only buy them like to believe that their purchased coins were cleaned by being gently brushed by the hair of 40 vestal virgins. They don't realize all the things people do to make that coin presentable. It's like that old saying ""You don't want to know how sausage is made."" When scrubbers are discussing methods, it's best for collectors to close their eyes and plug their ears until it is over.  =-}"
AncientCoins,30q8aq,antiquarian_bookworm,-1,Mon Mar 30 10:44:27 2015 UTC,"I know about coins and about cleaning. There is no need to give me beginner-level advice. As I said in another thread, I clean coins myself occasionally.  The fact is that most people who clean coins are not experts and their coins will be damaged, have scratches etc. You can see the results every day on Ebay. These coins have no commercial value.  Just an example: http://www.ebay.de/itm/Constantin-4-/371293708411?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_77&hash=item5672d4607b  Note that I said most, not all. I don't get this anger and this refusal to accept the simple fact that buying uncleaned coins on Ebay, cleaning and selling them is not a way to earn money and it is very, very hard to even break even, even while completely discounting the time spent cleaning the coins.   That's not the point of cleaning coins. It's a hobby that costs money, not a job or an investment. There are professional coin cleaners earning money with it but those are not cleaning coins from bulk lots of uncleaneds bought on Ebay. They are either cleaning them for paying customers or buying single coins that they think can be improved considerably and resold at a profit. Or they could clean hoards of coins for a dealer.  Even 'regular' coin collecting is a hobby that costs money. You'll have a very hard time getting all your money back when you sell your collection. Again, coin collecting and coin cleaning are not investments or businesses but hobbies."

It will get rid of the dusty look, and even more detail will pop out.  If you haven't got a dremmel, then a buff with a soft cotton rag, like an old washed t-shirt can do a similar job. Put the coin on your fingertip, put the rag on your knee, and zip the coin quickly back and forth across the rag. Rotate the coin, and do it again. The roughness is just very fine particles that are adhering to the surface and are causing a light scattering haze on the surface."

This subreddit is a bit heavy on cleaning threads but buying uncleaned coins is not the way to build a collection of nice coins. It is a hobby that can be enjoyable and rewarding in itself, of course. I agree, stay away from randomly buying on Ebay. It is almost impossible for a new collector to spot a fake seller. Ebay feedback is useless, professional fake sellers usually have spotless feedback, because they know how to work the system.   If an experienced collector recommends you one or more good Ebay sellers, then you should buy from them. The kinds of coins that a new collector usually buys are best bought on Ebay. Low-grade and 'cehap' coins are usually not cheap, when offered by a professional dealer. They have overhead, they actually have to get paid for each minute they spend attributing, measuring, weighing and photographing a coin. So a $5 coin turns into a $20 coin and the seller still doesn't make much of a profit.   Unfortunately, I don't buy much on Ebay US, so I can't recommend a good seller."

Someone cleaned this down to metal in some places it looks like, but I'm not certain...  EDIT: I'm trying to identify the type. I'm thinking maybe instead of a R over C on the right, it may be an R over SA monogram. The exergue is still bugging me though."
AncientCoins,30gsrj,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Fri Mar 27 06:24:24 2015 UTC,"This coin has nice detail, and you can see the stretch marks on the backfield areas from the striking.   I think somebody used electrolysis to clean this coin. Electrolysis often turn the patina black and crusty, like what is seen here. It could also be from a chemical cleaning, but the color and texture of it looks like electrolysis to me. The green patina turns black.  If this was my coin, I'd finish it off by blasting the remaining black chunky patina off, and take it down to raw bronze. The underlying coin has good smooth metal and the chunky black residual patina distracts from that. Also notice the big chunk left over on the soldier's head on the reverse.   If you haven't done cleaning before, you might not want to start with this one, but I think this coin would be improved with a total strip down. Either finish the electrolysis with intermittent scrubbing, or some vinegar and scrubbing.  But, there is no such thing as the absolute one way to clean a coin, so it depends on what you like. It's art, and nobody can tell you what you like.  After a total strip down it will look wrong, because the metal will be shiny, but it will tone with time to a dull brown, and the stripping will reveal the head of that soldier and a lot of other microscopic details."

(I've always been chubby which is why I ignored it for so long.)  When my lungs got to the point where they were mostly filled with fluid and I could barely breathe anymore I broke down and found a doctor to see if I had asthma or something.   He got a look at what was going on and insisted on calling an ambulance immediately, but I told him if my wife could drive me to his office she could drive me to the ER.

AncientCoins,307ow5,khaominer,4,Wed Mar 25 03:36:17 2015 UTC,I would just stick with deionized water and light brushing to see if you can work any of the other dirt off in the next couple days. It looks like the H2O2 may have oxidized the surface slightly but I've never used it for ancient coins before. See if the surface is different once you have the other crusty dirt off and you'll know. Although the patina has changed (perhaps?) it still seems intact. Maybe next time try it in H2O2 for an hour or only after a couple weeks of soaking with DI water and multiple changes have failed to work.
AncientCoins,307ow5,antiquarian_bookworm,3,Wed Mar 25 04:02:54 2015 UTC,"Ah. Okay. I just stuck it back in a container with DW.  I didn't think the H2O2 would oxidize it noticeably, but I suppose it might. Thanks for the info"
AncientCoins,307ow5,antiquarian_bookworm,3,Wed Mar 25 04:17:17 2015 UTC,"I'm curious if the texture is different at all-especially while wet?  I'm probably the farthest from knowledgeable on this sub but the darkness on the bottom one looks like some of the very dark tough mud I've had to toothpick off and the second looks more like the patina of some of my cleaner coins.  The reverse does looks slightly bronze though.  Again, take that as from someone with very little experience and all of my first sets still soaking."
AncientCoins,307ow5,antiquarian_bookworm,3,Wed Mar 25 04:24:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think that the texture is much different. As the dark layer ""peeled"" away, I saw it come off in little flecks.

AncientCoins,307ow5,Whizb4ng,1 point,Wed Mar 25 04:28:15 2015 UTC,"In the case of this coin, I think the dark stuff was organic material. Peroxide attacks organic material and makes it soluable. If you had not used the peroxide, then you would have had a darker colored coin.  I tried peroxide a bit, but was afraid that it weakened the patina. No proof of that, but I found I didn't need it so I stopped using it.  If the patina is weak and powdery, it will come off with scrubbing. If it start getting choppy, then you often have to take the coin down to bronze. I don't think this coin is at that level yet, and you can continue a DW soak and soft toothbrush scrub until the remaining dirt comes off.  When you first start cleaning coins, there is the tendency to get over-eager in blasting them clean quickly. Soak and scrub is slow, but the easiest on the patina. The more you try to rush them, the more likely you will damage the patina.  Otherwise, nice looking coin."
AncientCoins,307yv7,jojo32,4,Wed Mar 25 04:52:52 2015 UTC,"Bronze disease is the brighter green or sometimes blue stuff. There is also bright green or blue patina but bronze disease is generally flaky and powdery if you poke at it with a dental pick whereas the patina should be fairly solid or possibly slightly flaky but not powdery. Bronze disease is basically cuprous salts so if you stick the coin in some DW, in many cases the BD will take on a metallic shininess. You can also leave the suspect coin in DW for a few days and do a PH test of the water to determine if the coin has active BD or not. Acidic PH=BD. It also makes the water smell different if the coin has serious BD but you ought to be able to figure those out without further testing.  1,3,5,7,8 have BD methinks, but poke at the brighter green spots on the others and test"

Though I would love for it not to be all green like that...Number 1 just makes me so sad. 5 should be easily manageable. I was hoping you wouldnt say 3. It doesnt look so flakey/powedery more like a solidified slime...So if the BD is indeed BD but not active- is there any concern there? Ive worked alot with number 8, doesnt seem to be letting up with DW/olive oil."
AncientCoins,307yv7,Red_Spork,2,Wed Mar 25 06:17:49 2015 UTC,"If the BD is not active you don't necessarily need to be concerned, but you need to watch the coins. Active BD can reactivate given a particularly humid day or perhaps if you touch the coin and agitate it a bit. Just check any suspicious coins often and when in doubt, poke at it with a dental pick. There is definitely some overlap between active BD and inactive BD/patina/gunk but generally if it's powdery or flaky or shiny when underwater, it is bronze disease. Really for any coins that are suspect I'd poke at them a bit. Number 3 to me looks to be mostly inactive BD or patina but that crack and that area on the neck look very suspicious to me."

AncientCoins,307yv7,antiquarian_bookworm,3,Wed Mar 25 05:24:14 2015 UTC,"I just keep an eye on my coins for weeks after cleaning, and if there is any regrowth of powdery green stuff, then back in the soak and scrub they go. Rinse and repeat until it stops, sometimes months later.  Sometimes I have found there is a ""volcano zone"" of this going on, and then I'll use a mechanical tool like a pick to dig in and remove as much surface patina to let it out faster. That is all based on my opinion that bronze disease is an entrainment of ions inside the metal that is capped into the metal by the surface patina, so cleaning the bronze releases the cap and allows fast migration to the surface.   So a chemical bath might do this surface stripping of the patina for you, but it can't soak into the metal and pull the ions out. That has to happen with time. I base this on reports of behaviors from museums that have this problem with some bronze artifacts that are plagued by bronze disease. They often report that specific pieces from specific soil areas are cleaned, using various methods, and 1 month later there is a garden of green powder growing back. They keep cleaning them for up to a year, and then it slows down and stops. Attempts to use various chemical treatments doesn't seem to work any better than just waiting for it to stop."
AncientCoins,307yv7,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Wed Mar 25 14:25:29 2015 UTC,"There has always been a debate about what is bronze disease. Here's my opinion...  Patina is the corrosion that is on the surface. As long as the coin isn't damp for a very long time, the surface patina should stay as it is. The surface color of the corrosion has to do with the chemistry of the metal of the coin and of the chemistry of what the metal reacted with.  Bronze disease is somthing going on inside the bronze itself. The symptoms are that you can clean the bronze and the patina grows back. It is powdery and can be light or dark green. It's like a garden of grass that keeps growing back after you clean the coin.  Some museum conservators believe that this is because the reactant that forms the corrosion has become ingrained into the metal, and it is migrating out. Some conservators believe that electrolysis causes bronze disease.  I have rearely seen bronze disease as I decribe it above. It seems to slow down after a year, and then stop by itself, after cleaning the coin. In my not-so-humble-opinion, the corrosion ions are in the coin and cleaning the surface pulls the cork, and let's them out of the metal to create the surface corrosion. So over the milenia the metal has absorbed these ions, and you are letting them out.  So color has little to do with it. If the coin has bronze disease, you will find that a week after cleaning there are spots of green that are showing up or becoming thicker. Clean the surface again with just soak and srub. After about a year, it will stop."
AncientCoins,307yv7,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Wed Mar 25 12:30:30 2015 UTC,On to the bonus round! I'll just give you some clues to chase down...  1  Maybe janus?  2  Byzantine
AncientCoins,307yv7,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Wed Mar 25 13:25:50 2015 UTC,Janus... Hmm interesting. Was scrolling through some coins and the bust appears the same looking both directions. This coin is distinctly different on either side. The left side is much smaller. Any other clues? I thought that might be an m for Byzantine. Have a range of dates I can look to? My first thought was early Byzantine but I haven't seen anything like it in early Byzantine stuff- so maybe it is indeed late Byzantine.
AncientCoins,307yv7,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Thu Mar 26 03:17:31 2015 UTC,"The ""M"" is definately 40 nummi. The symbol on the obverse looks like a monogram? That makes it very interesting, I don't have anything like that. Monograms started appearing in the dark ages through the early medieval, then died out. So it is late byzantine, or a strange barbaric.  The one that might be Janus needs cleaning. The oblong shape is similar to the flans that were used to mint republic coins of that type. That would be exciting if it was Janus, but without more details then I think it may never be resolved. Two methods of cleaning, one is to try to scrub it down more, and the other is to work away at only the high points, to find the features."
AncientCoins,307yv7,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Thu Mar 26 09:36:32 2015 UTC,Oh? I thought that potential janus might just be worn smooth lost patina. I've been known to be tricked. I'll post an example in a couple days.

Denarii of Commodus or Marcus aurelius. Pm me if interested. If you're looking for something a little nicer, vcoins is the place to go. Very trustworthy group of dealers."
AncientCoins,300jxo,Lostcause_,4,Mon Mar 23 14:37:27 2015 UTC,"Don't expect to get an absolute steal as a new collector. If you stick with dealers on Vcoins(or with eBay sellers that also have a vcoins presence or otherwise are known in the ancient numismatics world) and shop around for prices you can at least get a competitive price, but do your research before going and making an offer on something. What you consider a good offer might be considered an insultingly low offer by a dealer, so before you go making offers look at auction results and offerings from other dealers. Make note of things like centering, eye appeal, metal quality, toning, etc as all of these things are the variables that determine pricing.   When I make an offer to a dealer I try to give them a fair offer while also balancing how long they've had the coin at the current price. I do sell my coins from time to time and I try not to buy anything that I couldn't resell within 2 months for at least the price I paid after shipping so if a dealer has had a coin in inventory for 2 years I'm going to ask for a lower price than if it had been there for 2 weeks, all other things being equal. I also look for coins on consignment because I've found consignors are often willing to accept an even lower price than a dealer might so if I am certain that a coin is on consignment I will ask the dealer to pass on my offer to the owner and give them my word that I will buy the coin immediately if they will accept my offer. This almost always works and I saved me a ton off the original asking price on my Antony denarius and my Julius Caesar denarius, but my Alexander The Great Tetradrachm for instance was already at such a great price I took the asking price even after my offer was declined. Honestly I wish I hadn't even made an offer because I feel like the asking price was entirely too low for me to even have asked for a discount on it in the first place.  Edit: I should also add: ask questions. If you don't know about a coin, post it here and ask us. If you're at all unsure, don't hesitate to ask."
AncientCoins,300jxo,Red_Spork,4,Mon Mar 23 17:38:06 2015 UTC,"The reputable dealers normally have ""full retail pricing"", so you are unlikely to get hot deals from them, but they are the safest place to buy, especially for beginners.  vcoins.com"
AncientCoins,300jxo,antiquarian_bookworm,4,Mon Mar 23 15:38:47 2015 UTC,"Some of the stores there have ""discounts"", from 10 to 25% off, either via a coupon you enter, or just a straight sale. Also, right now, forumancientcoins.com has a 10% off sale on everything"
AncientCoins,300jxo,pmstacker,3,Mon Mar 23 15:44:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there are sales, and the dealer is marking down stuff they might have overpriced to begin with. They are normally clearing old stock that hasn't moved well, so they can use the income to buy something they think will move faster, to avoid having their money locked up.  But buying from a ""going concern""* dealer has a low probability of you getting ripped off. Almost zero. So you might consider that to be worth a few more bucks.  I just thought I'd warn noobs that you normally aren't going to be able to get ""a steal"" off a professional dealer, because they know the market too well. As a matter of fact, noobs should be wary of ""a steal"" from non-professional sales because they are normally the ones who are being stolen from. There are so many fakes out there and they tend to be the fabulous coins that draw noobs in.  And every noob should go page through some of the coins at forgerynetwork.com as a warning about buying down dark alleys. Those are some nice looking coins, aren't they? And people got them real cheap. Be afraid... be very afraid... BOOOO!  =-}   a ""going concern"" is a business term that refers to a business that wants to stay in business for a long time. They try hard for quality and good price, to stay in business. They don't want to get involved in anything shady. The opposite of that is a ""fly by night"", which is a business model of getting in and out of the market and making a killing, no matter what."

See what you can find with the search term 'Alexander drachm' and buy the coin that offers the most bang for your buck.

AncientCoins,2zsmie,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Sat Mar 21 15:58:45 2015 UTC,Okay thank you. I was already on planning on doing this method to begin with. Do you plan on running it under hot water with some soap or is that a bad idea?

AncientCoins,2zsmie,TrogdorLLC,2,Sat Mar 21 16:47:31 2015 UTC,"Everybody has their own methods... but what I do is soak in DW and scrub once per day for a week. Then some will start to show detail. Then the easy dirt has come off, so I soak and then scrub only once per week.  I have tried soap, but I didn't see a big difference in how fast they cleaned up. If you have some coins that seem to repel water when you put them in the soak tub, then somebody might have been exposing them to an oil to clean them and soap can get that oil out, if it isn't in there too far."
AncientCoins,2zsmie,TrogdorLLC,2,Sat Mar 21 17:11:55 2015 UTC,""" I am going to be trying to attribute them, so no, this isn't me asking for help""  Yep, I understand that. Trying to figure them out is half the fun.  And don't give up on them until they give up. A lot of the time I've had what I've assumed was a slug, and it slowly turned into a coin. I've gone back to my slug box and given a slug a second chance, only to find that I had been too hasty in giving up.  The slow method of crusties can take months, or a year."

AncientCoins,2zq3d2,TrogdorLLC,5,Fri Mar 20 18:13:11 2015 UTC,"Gotta say, I've been slightly underwhelmed with both my orders from here. I don't think they overprice their coins, but the descriptions definitely make the ""hoards"" sound much more interesting than they actually are.   Also really questioning if any of their hoards have ever been found together as a group. They just seem like a large amount of finds added together. How could the same hoard contain a 300 BC Greek coin and a 13th century Islamic coin? I'd be interested to hear any realistic explanation."
AncientCoins,2zq3d2,Beastybeast,4,Fri Mar 20 20:59:46 2015 UTC,"Well, this will be my first order, and it's from one of their more pricy lots. We'll get to see together, as I document it all.

Edit: by the way, my last order arrived as the wrong hoard - a cheaper one. I wrote to them and they refunded the difference, but it was still a bit frustrating. Of course, this could very well be a genuine mistake."

I decided against changing my order to this Theseus hoard, because I only ordered 1/16kg.

AncientCoins,2zq3d2,ghsgjgfngngf,3,Fri Mar 20 22:01:38 2015 UTC,"Hoards is a bad term to use. These are normally not ancient hoards, but modern hoards. Dealers buy dirty coins from people and then chuck them in a pile. These local dealers might sell to bigger regional dealers, who might chuck them into a bigger lot. Now you have a hoard, but it was found one coin at a time over a year by 30 people.  Then somebody else buys this lot. They take out some, and replace them to make it come back out to a specific weight or count.  The lots get passed around, washed a bit,  inspected, sorted, junk added. The longer a lot has been passed around the more it gets stepped on by the dealers (to use a phrase from the 60's).  Some regional lots actually are culturally diverse. If the region is a port and trade zone, or traded hands many times by foriegn invaders, then you can find some rich diversity. But sometimes people are just taking old lots and dumping them together.  When I work a lot, I like to mark out the mint locations of the coins on a map. In the end, you get a feel as to where the lot came from. Archeologists do this to understand the trade in the area, and extract statistical data."
AncientCoins,2zq3d2,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Fri Mar 20 21:57:54 2015 UTC,"This is correct even if it's not popular to say here.   'Here we have an interesting mix of very large mainly Roman coins as well as a lot of the classical Greek coins that everyone loves to collect.'  This is not how hoards work. My impression is that the seller doesn't knowingly misuse the word, they simply don't seem to know much about ancient coins.

It's hard to say what it once was. If you want your coins identified, it would help if you would post clear pictures, with the coins correctly oriented and obverses and reverses clearly matched.  As it is, you seem to have got one good coin (the Republican as).  Then there's the Byzantine fake, the tooled coin and a worn Greek (maybe Seleucid) and a Syrian or Mesopotamian coin, most likely Philipp I, also in poor condition.   The Republican coin looks fine and $15 is a very good price for it, so it doesn't matter that the rest is mainly junk. But you should probably avoid buying from that particular source again."

AncientCoins,2zp474,Whizb4ng,5,Mon Mar 23 00:12:15 2015 UTC,People like to trot this out all the time. They will not grade a coin if they believe it to be a modern forgery. The wording on the guarantee is just to cover their butt if one slips through which does happen occasionally. I would say all of the biggest auction houses have had a fake slip by before. Dealers on VCoins have had fakes slip through as well but we still recommend them to all new collectors.  It is up to collectors if they suspect a coin to be a forgery to alert the dealer with the reasons they believe it to be false as well as photograph evidence of known fakes that match if possible.  Personally I would trust David Vagi and his team's eyes on a coin over many dealers in the field.
AncientCoins,2zp474,batwing97,1 point,Mon Mar 23 00:51:28 2015 UTC,"I agree completely, just a matter of semantics for me. A coin in a legitimate NGC case is as close as we can get to 'authentic'.

AncientCoins,2zl367,tim-72,2,Thu Mar 19 14:05:28 2015 UTC,So number 3 after looking seems to be Constantius II on the Obverse with a soldier spearing fallen horseman on the reverse (I could be stretching it here) which seems to be on alot of the Constantius II coins.   I kept looking and it looks like number 4 may also be Constantius II on the obverse with two soldiers holding spears and shields with one standard between them. X on banner. Can anyone confirm if my suspicions are correct for coins 3 and 4? Any guesses as to denominations of 3 and 4? I am thinking these are both bronze Centenionalis. Still no luck on coins 1 and 2.

Hygeia) standing left, feeding from patera a serpent coiled around an altar at her feet. From the bust I want to say Caracalla. Larger picture maybe I can get it.  Billon tetradrachm from Antioch. Philip I? Gordian III? Bust is really worn, can't tell if that is a beard or not. Some large Roman provincial... Really not sure. Byzantine anonymous follis, facing bust of Christ, IhSUS/XRISTUS/bASILU/bASILE, ca. 970s somethingsomethingGORDIANOC on the obverse, Serapis standing left with transverse scepter. Something like this. I want to say Philip I from the bust, and the reverse looks like Zeus seated left on throne holding scepter and probably an eagle. One possibility. Byzantine anonymous follis, facing bust of Christ, rev. patriarchal cross. 1071-1078 AD. Maybe Lucius Verus? It's too worn, pure guesswork from my side. Some tetarteron I assume, really not my area. An antoninianus of Tetricus II (not 100% certain) with Spes walking left, holding flower and raising hem of skirt. A fourrée of one of these Septimius Severus denarii with Minerva. I can read the ...COS II P P on the reverse. Looks like a very well circulated dupondius of Hadrian with Salus seated left like this. Antiochos IV / Winged Thunderbolt. Link. One of these. Arcadius/Constantinopolis. I think I read ANTA in the exergue on yours. Anonymous Byzantine follis, Jesus Christ King of Kings yadda yadda, like #5 but probably a different class based on the (mostly unclear) ornamentations. IMP C TET.... on the obverse, ...AX AV... on reverse. Tetricus I, ""PAX AVG"" but a funny barbarous imitation that has tried to squeeze the entire reverse legend unto the left half resulting in a weird AXAV inscription. Claudius II, DIVO CLAVDIO / CONSECRATIO I honestly don't see any details at all, sorry. I read GORDIANVS PIVS FEL... and I see a radiate crown, so an antoninianus of Gordian III. Can't tell the reverse type. Billon tetradrachm of Alexandria, name is off-flan but reminds me of Diocletian the most.   Alright, all done!

Laureate, draped and cuirassed bust right. Rev: VP CAB MODECTOV NIKOPOLEITWN PROC ICTPON. Serapis standing facing, head left, raising right hand and holding transverse scepter in left. Varbanov 4224. Certainly Zeus and definitely an eagle there. The obverse is the tricky part. How many different options could there be based on the zeus reverse? IMPRESSIVE! Anonymous follis of Christ, class H, Michael VII, Ducas, 24 October 1071 - 24 March 1078 A.D. 10351. Bronze anonymous follis, Anonymous follis of Christ, class H; SBCV 1880, aF, Constantinople mint, obverse IC - XC, bust of Christ facing, with nimbus cruciger, wears pallium and colobium, raising right, Gospels in left; reverse patriarchal cross with globule and two pellets at each extremity, floral ornaments on either side. I certainly agree on that reverse. Once again I wonder how many bearded individuals have that zeus reverse? I feel like the one you picked is the only possibility. Having trouble matching the bust perfectly though. So I see two individuals side by side, crosses on their head. Right above them in the middle is a box. Dont they refer to that as 4 gospels? With the dots? I was hoping someone could catch the legend. I see two S's. I fear cleaning this any further will make it harder to identify.  Has words on the back kinda like number 5. That appears correct, unless you see anything that makes you doubt: http://www.acsearch.info/search.html?id=1873202 TETRICUS II (Caesar, 273-274). Antoninianus. Colonia Agrippinensis. Obv: C PIV ESV TETRICVS CAES. Radiate and draped bust right. Rev: SPES PVBLICA. Spes walking left, holding flower and raising hem of skirt. RIC 272. TIL what a fourrée is! Does that make it valuable? Being that it isnt modern, I assume it is still collectable? On the obverse I think I see evidence of IMP V I cant make IMP VII or IMP IIII fit. So,  SEPTIMIUS SEVERUS (193-211). Fourrée Denarius. Rome. Obv: L SEPT SEV PERT AVG IMP V. Laureate head right. Rev: P M TR P III COS II P P. Minerva standing left, holding spear and round shield. RIC 61. I believe I was looking at this same one! I searched ""dupondius seated left"" and that was the closest match. I definitely see the altar, just couldn't be sure if there was a serpent there. Though now that I look at it again, I think I see a very smooth part for the body of the serpent at the left edge of the altar. Funny it doesnt look like it in the scan. Pretty rad. How did you narrow it down? I looked at a lot of these and how they varied on the reverse. Extremely cool! How did you narrow it down? The exergue? Or just being familiar with the portrait? I figure I might try to keep cleaning this sucker. I just think there is no obverse to be seen. Sometimes the reverse is revealing enough, which helped me ID a few other byzantines I found, but I think this has that little standard phrase. Barbarous imitation huh? It would be my first. Is the reverse legend the only thing pointing to that? Does this one look fake? I have a few other DIVO CLAVDIO/CONSECRATIO coins. The reverse is too worn for me to make out which Consecratio reverse this is. Also it is SOOOO THIN. It is also less than a gram if I remember correct. Looks like a tree on one side. I figured that would be telling. There is a center line, then what appear to be lines angled upwards like branches. That was my bet as well. Someone standing left on the back! This one is strange- sort of bubbled up in one area. Definitely AVG at the end pretty tight on the reverse. Probably sol. So, Gordian III antoninianus, 29 July 238 - 25 February 244 A.D. Rome mint; obverse IMP GORDIANVS PIVS FEL AVG, radiate, draped and cuirassed bust from behind; reverse AETERNITATI AVG, Sol standing front, head left, raising right hand and holding globe in left. RIC IV 83. That looks about right! http://www.acsearch.info/search.html?id=23194 When I was searching Probus I could not find the letters in the fields to match."
AncientCoins,2zk7su,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Sat Mar 21 06:07:09 2015 UTC,"1 - Pretty sure it's this. Your reading of the letters really helped! I often try searches with ""Y"" in place of ""V"" or ""U"" in legends I suspect to be greek, in this case ""NEPOYA"" was the key. A very rare coin, it seems!  3 - sure about AN AVG? It should end CEB (Sebastos), not AVG (Augustus) being issued with a Greek legend.   5 - Basil II OR Constantine VIII, they both issued the type.  7 - hard to determine, so many different synonyms and languages that exhaustive searches are difficult to do. The best candidate I have found so far is Gordian III, but it frustrates me slightly that I can't find one where Zeus's outstretched arm is at the same low angle.  9 - Looks like Septimius Severus is the only properly bearded guy that I can find a match for.  10 - Hmm, maybe a lead bulla?  12 - They are definitely still collectable, if a bit more niche than the official denarii of a proper silver content. I can't tell for sure if yours was once silvered, or if it's simply a ""limes denarius"" - do another search for that term ;)  14 - I really love Seleucid coins and after picking up a good amount recently I've been spending hours on end staring at Seleucid coins. I remember spotting this one a couple times so I was lucky enough to recognize it and I didn't even need to do any narrowing down.  15 - I recognized the type and then read the ...CA... of the obverse legend in the right spot for Arcadius.   17 - Portrait also doesn't really look like Tetricus and the obv. legend is of an exaggerated style. Far from the crudest of the unofficial issues imitating Tetricus I've seen though, they can get really bad sometimes (or really good, depending on your view, ha!)  18 - It's too worn for me to tell properly, but the A in ..ATIO does look a lot like II, which an extremely typical legend error for barbarous coins. Together with the weight of under a gram I'd call it a slam dunk.  19 - Aha! Probably Ambibulus or Coponius, ca. 6-12 AD if that's the right type I have in mind.  20 - Hmm yea I can actually see the raised right hand when you point it out, I think you're correct on the reverse type.

The simpulum was the sign of Roman priesthood, and one of the insignia of the College of Pontiffs.   The simpulum appears on a coin from Patras struck under Augustus. It is placed before the head of Vesta, as a mark of that goddess, on a coin of the Domitian family, and is seen in the hand of a Vestal Virgin on coins of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. A man in a toga holds a simpulum in his hand on a coin of Antonio Drusi.  The simpulum is commonly shown with the lituus and other sacrificial and augural instruments, on coins of Julius Caesar, Mark Antony, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, Augustus, Caligula, Vespasian, Nerva, Antoninus Pius, Marcus Aurelius, Caracalla, Publius Septimius Geta, Volusianus, Saloninus, Valerianus Minor, Domitius Calvinus and Pontius Pilate, as well as on many consular and colonial medals.

AncientCoins,2zfoyl,khaominer,3,Wed Mar 18 04:34:57 2015 UTC,"I've never taken before photos, so I can't help you there.  I haven't read the Noble coin cleaning manual for quite some years, but they developed methods for recovering the most extreme crusties, from what I remember. Have you read their manual?   That first batch you show are crusties. the next step to attacking them is a long bristled brass brush. A weekly soak and scrub of crusties can take 6 months to see results. Once you start to see you are close to the coin, you can switch to rubbibg the crusty spots with a tool like dental pick or exacto knife.  You could blow the whole thing away in less than an hour with electrolysis. Some people don't like the results because it brings it down to very bare metal, and looks porous. The coin actually is porous, and electrolysis is just showing reality. Some people think the electrolysis is causing the pours, but I don't think so. Incorrect use of electrolysis can eat into the bronze, so you have to know how to do it and watch carefully.  Why use the slow brushing rather than electrolysis? If you use the brushing you might be able to save some part of the patina on the coin, and maybe even create a two tone effect. But you might find that after a year of effort, the electrolysis was the better way to go. You will never know until you try.  The other coin might have some silver plate coming off the coin. It is hard to tell with your photo.  If you try to pry the stacked coins apart, they are very likely to break. Those can take a year or more to separate. Use an exacto to wear the crust from between them, and months latter you might get them to fall apart. Or you can use electrolysis to loosen them."

Also, if you are active to the point that they feel they should do this, odds are you have created a great deal of content for them.  Even if it is just you posting thread after thread asking for advice and them taking time to respond to it gives me, a third party browsing, a reason to join.

Use a circular motion. Brush lightly and check it every several rotations to make sure you aren't hitting the bronze. That will smooth it out.  A tip about photography... if you illuminate the coin from the upper left, and hit the coin at about 30 degrees, the shadows will help to illuminate the detail better."

AncientCoins,2zas3m,Tetradrachm,3,Tue Mar 17 02:22:42 2015 UTC,"Under Italian law, all antiquities must be registered with the government.  Newly found antiquities belong to the government.  So if Italians are digging a well and find some old coins, they must surrender them to the police.  Under US law, countries that have a serious problem with looting / grave-robbing / metal-detecting are allowed to ask for a ""Memorandum of Understanding"" which lists the kind of artifacts being looted.  Currently the US and Italy have one and it covers, among other things, coins of Greek Sicily.  So Americans can't just bid in British and German auctions for such coins, because without paperwork showing the coins have been on the collector market for years it is against the law to bring them to the US.  The Italians are asking for an extension.  The extensions last for five years.  The extension doesn't have to cover the same stuff.  It could cover fewer coin types or more coin types.  If it covered all Roman Imperial coins it would be frustrating, because these coins would be selling openly in many EU countries, but Americans wouldn't be able to buy them.  Some folks would like to see all ancient artifact sales banned.  Others feel the sale of common objects like coins and rings is not a big deal.  The purpose of filing comments is so that the US representatives don't just rubber-stamp whatever the Italian representatives ask for."

So a common late roman coin found in spain would be illegal to own. I don't think that would happen, but fear... you know.  I've had a foot on both sides of this issue. I've done a lot of volunteer work in archaeology, so I've seen the damage to valuable sites caused by treasure seekers. On the other hand, I've collected antiquities since I was young. I'm pretty conflicted about this, so I stay silent and hope you folks work it out for me. =-}"
AncientCoins,2zas3m,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Wed Mar 18 00:30:41 2015 UTC,Steve Roach has a new essay on CoinWorld.com about the issue.  It is troubling that I can't convince a fellow-collector such as yourself.  Italy has had laws against treasure seeking for decades.  A few people on both sides of the Atlantic willing to ignore laws can cause a lot of destruction.  If there was a legal and transparent market the legitimate sellers would have an incentive to keep out the bad actors.  A legal market with give property owners an incentive to keep diggers out.  The current scheme is not working for pre-211 BC coins and increasing the categories of coins controlled by the MOU will decrease the visibility that is needed to stop the digging.

Coins with origins within the boundaries of modern Italy are very common. During the time coins have been on the Italian MOU I have not bough or bid on the Etruscan or Greek Sicilian coins that I have seen openly sold in auctions in EU countries. If the MOU is renewed I will continue respecting it -- but what purpose does it serve for Americans to be barred from markets that continue to be active without us?  Let us make markets more transparent, and provide no incentive for secrecy.  I am a coin collector and independent scholar. I am not a dealer nor do I have a financial interest in this matter."

I would say I broke even as far as value as I actually have sold a few from it, but there were a lot of duds in that one. Maybe 65% unidentifiable, 20% identifiable but bad condition, with the remaining being identifiable and in gVG higher condition including some really cool fractionals and a rarer Roman AE from Jerusalem.  I would say cleaning it was a lot more fun than cleaning late Roman AEs but you will probably get less duds with late Roman AEs, but of course you might get lucky on the Holy land coins or you might get super unlucky with the Roman ones.  Also, be prepared to wait. They get export permits and things for all their coins and this takes time. Then shipping takes time. Then customs takes time and in some cases a lot of time. My order took a good 3 or 4 weeks from order to delivery.  Edit: I should point out, I put ""hoard"" in quotes because in general what they call a hoard is not a hoard at all but a bunch of coins found in geographical proximity as evidenced by the time span in a single ""hoard""."

AncientCoins,2z8h7w,kpgfisty,5,Mon Mar 16 14:34:48 2015 UTC,"I have a slow modem connection, and was only able to view the top part of the first 6 coins. That took 20 minutes! Not your problem, but I'm just saying my opinions come from only being able to get a peek at some of the coins.  Anyway, the first five look like they are still encrusted with only mud, and you should continue the soak and scrub.   The 6th coin looks like it might have true ""crusty"" encapsualtion. On a true crusty, some of the metal has migrated out and bonded with the mud, creating an encasement that is hard as concrete. You will know that you have this when soak and scrubbing for weeks has no effect on it anymore. You have hit a dead end.  When you say you have been soaking and scrubbing for a ""long time"", how long are you talking? What I normally do is soak and scrub them every night for a week, then I back off to soak and srub once per week. More soaking and less scrubbing. How much time have you given these coins?  Anyway, when you truely do hit an endpoint with a coin and it will no longer yeild to soak and scrub with a toothbrush, then you can try harsher methods. One method is soak and scrub with a brass brush. Don't use steel and don't use a short brissle brush, because that would be too harsh.   If you have part of the coin exposed, with a nice patina, and the rest is encrusted, then you might damage the patina if you brush the whole coin. So you can switch to rubbing and poking with an exacto knife. Use small circular motions with the tool, and jab the encrustation a bit. Soak a week, then poke and jab, then soak a week, etc.  Did you see my previous post about a wooden coin vise? It is wise to use something like that when you get to the poke and scrape phase of cleaning.  Otherwise it looks like some decent coins you got. I mentioned I never bought dirties off ebay, but I'm not saying other people shouldn't. I have said it is unwise for newbie collectors to buy cleaned coins off ebay due to the high number of fakes.  Cleaning dirties can take anywhere from one week to more than a year. Don't get impatient and try to scrub them clean in a week, because you might ruin the patina (but then you will have learned something!=-}).

AncientCoins,2z3f3c,justme46,3,Sun Mar 15 04:41:08 2015 UTC,"You can't save the patina on every coin, no matter how hard you try. Sometimes the surface of the coin has a crust that wants to come off the coin, so it falls off in chunks or flakes off as you clean it. Then you end up with bare metal.  Some other coins have a patina that is very well adhered to the coin, and then you have the option to save it if you want to. The patina can really add some beauty to the coin, so why not leave it on? You could blow it off, but your blowing off something nice.  Sometimes there is a well adhered patina, and it is obstructing the detail of the coin, so you might find that tearing it down to bronze improves the coin.  Sometimes the patina is so thick on the coin, that the details of the features of the coin are all in the patina, and blowing the patina off brings it down to a bronze with much less detail. Niow if you remove the patina, you have just removed the detail.  So each coin is different, and as you work the mud off the outer layer, you need to read the coin and try to figure out which way to go with it. there is no one right answer, but there are sometimes better answers than others for that one specific coin.  One new style is to leave some of the compacted dirt and/or corrosion as the backfield and only clean the dirt down in thin layers to reveal the features peeking through, and this creates a two-tone effect that really makes the coin have a high contrast and very easy to read. Not many coins can be cleaned this way, because the conditions need to be just right for the coin patina and for the compacting dirt.  You do whatever you can to make the coin attractive. there is no one way that is ""right"". It's an art.  And why spend 10 hours cleaning a coin that will only be worth $5 when you are done? It's because you love the art of cleaning them and are not doing it for the money. It's an art and an adventure. If you don't feel those things, then you won't be a scrubber for long.  Go to Noble coins and see their before and after photos. Download and read their free cleaning manual. Look at web sites with cleaned coins and see what you think this person did to clean that coin. What techniques do you think they used? Do you like their results? Would you have gone a different way with it?"
AncientCoins,2z3f3c,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Sun Mar 15 12:09:34 2015 UTC,"As a_b says. Good advice there.  Use your '$2 coins' for plenty of practice. The last thing you want to do is jump to a more valuable coin and mess it up. The soaking is trivial. You have to watch out for the scrubbing as you can remove some patina that can remove detail. Then when you get to the mechanical cleaning, you'll really need your wits about you.  Do a lot of your '$2 coins'."
AncientCoins,2z3f3c,SolarDub,2,Sun Mar 15 14:15:04 2015 UTC,"yep yep! I've been buying uncleaned Romans from Noble Romans, just to practice on. It's a good thing, too, because I've really stripped some down too far. I'm a history fanatic and a coin fanatic, so this is something I do to force my mind to slow down, and relax. It's also mind-boggling to me that I'm cleaning away stuff that is 1800 years old or so, and being the first person to see the face of this coin since antiquity.  Of course, it would be great to find a $20 or $30 coin in a grouping that I paid $3.75 each for, but I still enjoy learning about the history of the coins, and checking out the detail on the good ones, and remembering just how LONG ago this was made, by hand."
AncientCoins,2z3f3c,TrogdorLLC,2,Sun Mar 15 15:54:08 2015 UTC,"It's good to start with late romans, because they are easier to attribute once you clean them. They were minted in such high quantities that many will have good detail at a low price.   You are buying the ""premium grade"", and so you will have few frustrations of hitting slugs. Later on, you might be bold enough to try some ""low grade"" coins for a buck or buck fifty. Those give the wildest results, with broken flans, slugs, other ""things"" besides roman coins (like buttons!). Some people who start out with the one dollar coins come back and say ""HEY! These are crap!"". =-} You will notice also that the one buck ones are the dirtiest, those ""coins"" were quickly culled out of the lot and chucked aside with very little consideration.

AncientCoins,2yyzym,Nikodeimos,3,Sat Mar 14 01:23:49 2015 UTC,"That's the appeal of worn coins to me. While a nice EF or better coin of course has a lot of eye appeal, a worn counterpart does have more historical sentiment. For example, at the Coin Cabinet in Brussels I handled a spectacular aureus of Domitian that looked like it was struck yesterday. On the same tray were numerous worn aurei of Domitian, looking a lot less sharp and some of them very worn. But still, those worn coins had a charm of their own. How many generations of Romans who loved, fought, hated and laughed held those coins, buying a house, a horse, nice clothes for a festival, etc.  I have a Cappadocian posthumous tetradrachm of Antiochos VII, a series that was most likely struck to pay Syrian mercenaries, so that's some clue as to who might've once held my coin in hand. And of course Mark Antony's coins struck to pay his legionaries hint at at least one of the past owners."
AncientCoins,2yyzym,born_lever_puller,4,Sat Mar 14 13:30:35 2015 UTC,"I have a large coin found in spain that somebody made into a serrated hand knife. I found it in a dirty lot, and when I contacted the dealer who sold it to me, he apologized and said he would throw in some extras to make up for that in my next order. I was trying to tell him I LIKED that, he thought I was complaining.  It seems to be from about 50 BC or earlier, and the person who did this was mimicing the style of a stone tool that was still commonly used at that time in spain, often called a dentriculated scraper. Because it is a ""coin"" with a unique story to tell, it is one of my favorites, even though it has been multiated.  Even coins with holes in them don't bother me, because I think about what was this person doing? Some appear to have been worn as amulets, and other appear to have been nailed onto something. That ADDS to the coin, even though most collectors would throw it in the cull pile. Those coins have ""more history"" than other coins.  And, just as some other tangential data, I read theat the average time that a coin was in circulation in the late roman empire was about 80 years.  I also have a large coin from the first century that was cut in half, right down the middle of the emperor. The cut mark is patinated over, so it was done in ancient times, and it definately was a cut and not a break. Some people call this ""barbaric change"". =-} That is more valuable to me than the whole coin.  So a cheap worn coin can carry history."

AncientCoins,2ywtl7,antiquarian_bookworm,3,Fri Mar 13 18:42:39 2015 UTC,"That's bronze and close to the same style. One problem with trying to pinpoint this coin is that the greeks made many different issues with Athena in battle helmet and Nike on the reverse, and there is no writing on your coin to pin it down exactly. Otherwise, it would have the name of the king on it, and it would be nailed.  Also, other cultures mimiced greek coins, because greece was the powerhouse of the region for hundreds of years in the BC time period. That makes some coins without writing difficult or impossible to nail down. The artwork on your coin is top notch, so I think it truely is greek. They had some really good artists.  But I think you can describe your coin and time period from the research you just did. What was the full description of that bronze coin you just showed?  Do you collect ancients or is this your first coin?"

The style of the bust seems to imply a 'barbaric' coin or at any rate a local imitation.   That thing going on at the top of his head is pretty weird. Maybe a fault with the die?  Overstrikes are pretty common around this period (348-360'ish). FTR falling horsemen in particular are found overstruck on older coins, both officially and 'unofficially'. Of course, estimating the frequency of overstriking is hard, because we can generally only detect failed overstrikes (as a perfect overstrike wouldn't show any abnormality)"

It is most likey to be more than you paid. You had fun, it either didn't cost anything, or you might have made some money.  Some people have a hobby of fishing. A boat, $1500. Fishing gear, $300. Bait, $100. Gas, $200. Then you go out and catch $30 worth of fish. Those fish now are worth about $80 per pound, not really a wise deal, depending on the type of fish.

AncientCoins,2yquq8,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Fri Mar 13 12:14:50 2015 UTC,I don't assign values to my coins. A coin's value is what it sells for when it is sold. You can always find an example of a coin you cleaned on offer for any amount of money. This has nothing to do with the value of the coin.   So have you SOLD any uncleaned coin for $200? That would be the definition of a $200 coin.
AncientCoins,2yquq8,jojo32,2,Fri Mar 13 12:50:15 2015 UTC,"""I don't assign values to my coins. ""  Well, that is very unusual. Most people have a ball park idea what their coins are worth.  It is pretty normal for scrubbers to line up their top coins in the recent lot and check to see if they broke even on the buy. This means searching for what they are offered for and sold for (ebay has a feature to allow finding final bids on coins). If you lost your ass on a lot, then don't buy from that lot again.   Yes, you do need to look at many coins of that species to figure out a ball park number for it.  And another thing to keep in mind is that since coins are continuously being pulled out of the ground, a certain species of coin that WAS valuable can drop drastically in value if more and better ones are found. Ask many old Greek collectors about this, coins that went for thousands a few decades ago now go for hundreds. Many more Greeks have been found.  Another point is that dealers can sit on a coin for a very long time and ask the highest price, waiting years for just the right buyer to come along. Auction prices can be lower (but sometimes higher!) depending on who is watching the auction.  What I'm telling people is that you need to plow through a lot of dirties to find one cherry. They do exist in some of these lots, but I warn people that on average, it is more of a pass time than a money making adventure. It IS a hobby that you normally will not lose money, unlikely many other hobbies, such as wine tasting. =-}"
AncientCoins,2yquq8,p4rus,1 point,Fri Mar 13 13:11:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the coin collecting 101. These myths are perpetuated all the time, there are absolutely no treasures to find in Uncleaned lots. After cleaning, if you're any good at it, you'll end up with coins that you could sell (never mind any theoretical 'values') for less than you paid for them, not factoring in time spent (since it's a hobby, not a job) or materials used. A professional dealer, depending on their business model, may be able to spend years waiting to sell a particular coin, if they have a large inventory.  The best site to research values for Late Romans is probably cgb.fr  http://www.cgbfr.com/boutique,romaines.html  You'll never in a million years find anyone to pay you these prices but the theoretical value of your collection will skyrocket!"
AncientCoins,2yquq8,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Fri Mar 13 16:05:11 2015 UTC,Did you read about this? How many thosuands of coins have you cleaned? How many decades have you been in the ancients?
AncientCoins,2yquq8,ghsgjgfngngf,2,Fri Mar 13 17:57:54 2015 UTC,"You are obscenely closed minded about all of this. Dont you know there is a world of people outside the circle of your immediate existance. You going to tell me that my Elagabalus coin with seated poseidon reverse that I paid $1 for wont sell for more? I could walk in to a dealer and sell it for more than that. I could sell it for more on /r/coins4sale. I could even sell it for more on ebay. As I have already said, my situation is much different than others in that I hand picked all my uncleaned coins. Also I moved to a new area. In southern california at my LCS they NEVER dealt in ancients. Some really nice coins came in, I paid $50 for hundreds of dollars in cleaned ancients because there is simply no market for this dealer. Its only silver there. I came up here in washington an my LCS top seller is ancients. I sold a coin a paid a few dollars for for $60 bucks. He flipped it within a couple days for over $100. The point being you have NO IDEA what something will sell for because it has so much to do with who you are dealing with."

AncientCoins,2you07,antiquarian_bookworm,3,Wed Mar 11 19:20:11 2015 UTC,"The reason they are tucked away and forgot is because museums and universities value these coins as objects of study, and these coins, although rare, are already well documented.

Our museum here has a substantial collection of Roman lamps  and glass that will most likely never be put on display unless a Roman traveling exhibit comes to town because it is not the focus of the museum.

AncientCoins,2yiywt,Cl0s3tStoner,5,Tue Mar 10 04:46:12 2015 UTC,"Two things: First, that sounds to me a lot like someone wanting to take advantage of you. With uncleaned coins everyone that sells them picks through them to some degree and I would be very cautious of anyone offering to sell me ""the crustiest"" of the lot. There are some sellers who will allow you to pay more for the better quality coins: Noble Roman Coins, Crusty Romans, etc. but there are a lot of eBay sellers and things out there trying to pass off culls as unsearched lots.  Second thing: I don't suggest buying a big lot of uncleaned coins up front. It's really easy to get bored of cleaning coins. I don't know how many people I've encountered who are into ancients collecting that have a big container of uncleaned coins that they haven't even looked at for years because they bought 50 or 100 and cleaning wasn't for them. I enjoy it personally, but it's because I actively seek out better coins to clean and I've found some nicer ones in the process, but I have easily paid $10+ per coin sometimes to keep my interest piqued and even so, I still have a pile of ""boring"" late Roman coins that I'm just not motivated to clean because I'm tired of spending all that time to clean up the same few coins from the same few mints. YMMV, but consider that even if your lot turns out to be relatively dud-free(i.e. free of coins that are just too slick to ID) it will likely still be full of the same few coins without anything of significant monetary value if it's like the great majority of uncleaned coins that show up on the market today. It's really not uncommon to pay $40 or more each for really good uncleaned coins that clean up into gems just because everyone picks through them and they know what to look for, and you won't get bored on those, but those are becoming harder and harder to find every day."
AncientCoins,2yiywt,Red_Spork,3,Tue Mar 10 05:58:52 2015 UTC,"Wow, $40 each, you must be working the top drawer stuff. I've never gone beyond $8. I'm into quantity, rather than quality. I really value diversity, and I know what you mean about plowing through the late roman bronze, same piece after another.  Very good advice about not buying big from a dealer and lot you don't know. Just sample about 10, and don't ask for anything special. Don't hint you might buy more. That will give you a good sample of what the lot has in it. Then go for a buy of 25, 50, or 100 if you think those are good.  I've gotten stung on some dirty buys. Sluig content 50%, heavily corroded coins, no decent patina left, etc. I would hate to get 100 like that.  And once I got this sample that just blew me away, at $1.50 each. They weren't all super dirty, so you could see some of the features, but what I was finding was just fantastically diverse and great. I ordered 100 more, and got antsy, and order 100 more, then 250 more, and then the lot was gone. It was like a buying fever. That was the sweetest lot I've ever seen.  Noble coins has a free pdf manual about cleaning, if I remember right. Everybody comes up with their own cleaning methods, and who can say what is the right way as long as the coin comes out OK. Also, who can define what an OK coin is? It's an art, but knowing some science can help you get it done. I think Noble was recommending chemicals, and I'm not into that, but to each their own.  For you people who think they are going to get rich cleaning coins, forget it. On average you are usually just going to break even, and end up with a lot of lower grade coins you may not like. You have to have a sense of adventure to catch a thrill off this. A love of mystery, and the ability to love a coin even if it is lower grade."

AncientCoins,2yiywt,TrogdorLLC,2,Sun Mar 15 19:55:53 2015 UTC,"Ooo... one more thing. You will see ""uncleaned coins"" and ""dirty coins"". Usually ""uncleaned"" means they are either showing features, or have already been cleaned down far enough to see features. Somebody has already seen them, and consider them not worth the bother to finish cleaning. But you might consider it worth the bother.  ""Dirty"" usually means they are so chock full of dirt you can't see anything. This is more rare. Who wants to sell a lot that might have something valuable in it? What people often do in this case is to sample clean a dozen of them themselves, and get an idea of what the lot contains. You are more likely to find ""treasure"" in a lot like that.   And as i mentioned previously, ""crusties"" normally mean they have some corrosion going on, and may have pitting or blown off patina. The green crust is the copper migrating out of the coin and joining with the cirt, to make a really hard encasement around the coin. You might get something sweet, but it is unlikely to get a good patina off that coin, so people strip them down and commonly repatinate them. I just let them recover a natural brown patina over the years."
AncientCoins,2yiywt,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Tue Mar 10 13:38:05 2015 UTC,"My first experience with uncleaned coins was via my LCS. It was a box of unclean coins from his childhood. I paid less than a dollar each and bought a ton. There were many slick coins that were nothing, several of the same old, and several really neat coins! So my experience there has been great. I DONT think I would have as good of an experience buying from any of these companies. They would be more per coin, and the percentage of slick/commons would be higher for sure- just like those large foreign coin lots- filled with the same boring stuff.    My second experience was with the same LCS. Someone had come in and sold their late husbands collection. There were tons of already cleaned coins, many of which I have purchased, and TONS of uncleaned. The nice thing about that is he lets me handpick through the uncleaned for whatever ones I want. I pick the ones where I can see the most details, or large coins with thick dirt, and skip over the ones that appear slick. This is the best way to do it if you can find the opportunity. Getting to pick out your own uncleaned puts you closer to guarantee that you'll find something good."

AncientCoins,2ygw05,gordie44,3,Mon Mar 9 18:47:50 2015 UTC,"These have been about a week in DW, with light brushing with a brass brush every day.   I have most of the crud off of them, but the details are still pretty weak. Is there a way to get some of the detail to pop more? Is there a way to get the patina off, or is this not recommended?   And a side question, is it safe to assume that all black coins with a slight silver tint are Silver? I see most ancient silver has the patina stripped for ID. I assume this is done with baking soda and aluminum foil?"
AncientCoins,2ygw05,antiquarian_bookworm,3,Mon Mar 9 18:51:40 2015 UTC,"Cleaning is an art form, and different people like their coins different ways. The old way was to just scrub them down until no dirt remained. That required soaking and then scrubbing with a soft toothbrush, repeat every week until spanking clean.  A more modern accepted method is to leave some dirt in the back field areas and use that as contrast for the raised detail areas. To do that, you get the coin wet, and then you can use your index finger and softly rotate on the surface areas to remove the dirt on the high points. The high points will become darker and smooth, and really stand out. Make sure your fingers are clean, or you will be darkening the light colored dirt. Buff lightly on your old cotton jeans (and you will end up with holes in them). If there is one small troublesome spot, you can break the tip off a wooden toothpick and chew the end, to make a tiny scrub brush and work the worst areas. Don't work it too hard or you will remove the patina. It takes some close inspection and patience.  Both of these coins look like they have been scrubbed down with a toothbrush already, and only the smallest bit of residual dirt remains to do the two-tone dirty cleaning method. When you do this method, DON'T soak them for a week, like normal. You might find the dirt coming off in places that you never intended, and it will end up with a mottled look. If that happens and the mottled look is too bad, then you have to finish it off with the super-clean method I mentioned first.  Also, you mention brass brush, and that can be a bit harsh when you get down towards the end of cleaning. It might be the reason you have lost some patina off the obverse of the second coin. Might have come off anyway, but you can use a soft toothbrush to go easy on the patina, and it is often better towards the end.  People usually do clean silver right down as far as possible, but I have seldom done silver, because I'm a bronze collector. If you have a fouree coin, then it is best to leave as much of the silver on and not aggressiely try to clean it, so a lot of fourees look pretty chopped up and crudy, for that reason."
AncientCoins,2ygw05,antiquarian_bookworm,3,Mon Mar 9 19:48:21 2015 UTC,"Interesting, thanks so much!   This is my first time ever cleaning, (obviously lol) so I just kind of went for it, trying to get the coins clean enough to just identify. I had not even heard of the method you mentioned about leaving the fields a bit darker.   Thanks again!"
AncientCoins,2ygw05,antiquarian_bookworm,3,Mon Mar 9 20:09:32 2015 UTC,"I remember when I first started, and because I was unsure about what I was looking at, I would over clean them to find more detail. Sounds like that is what you were doing.  One way to look at it is if you under clean a coin, you can always go back later and clean it more. If you over clean a coin, you can't put it back. =-}  And the raw copper look you see will darken down to a dull brown color over the years, and make it less glaring, and more acceptable.  Good job on first coins. There are a lot of tricks, and I use a whole box full of tools. Don't rush it."
AncientCoins,2ygw05,antiquarian_bookworm,3,Mon Mar 9 20:15:40 2015 UTC,"http://i.imgur.com/22EswQp.jpg  In this image, look at the coin box on the right. It contains roman coins. Two of them have been ""two-tone"" cleaned with dirt remaining, and they seem to want to jump out of the box. The others in the same box are cleaned right down to the patina, and you can't even see them.  The two-tone dirty cleaning method is really useful when you have heavily worn coins that have low relief, and the dirt can help accent the details, otherwise you would just end up with a worn coin that is hard to read."
AncientCoins,2ygw05,ghsgjgfngngf,3,Mon Mar 9 20:24:41 2015 UTC,"Opps, more about the silver...  Some coins are blackish even when they are bronze. One reason is that some roman coins contian a bit of silver, like 15%, but are still considered bronze coins. Another reason is if somebody cleaned them with oil instead of water. Another reason might be that they have picked up an organic coating that has blackened the surface when they were buried.  I once got a large silver Seleucid coin in a dirty lot, and it was a light pink-purple colr. Really weird. It had some strange encapsulation shell of what seemed to be calcium carbonate, maybe colored by permanganate? Lots of weird chemistry going on.  But black can mean silver..."
AncientCoins,2ygvi9,Blyantsholder,2,Mon Mar 9 18:44:03 2015 UTC,"It's not a good photo, but...  The fact that it is so perfect should make you suspicious. One of the first things to do is go to forgerynetwork.com and search their database for Galerius and see if there is a die match for it.  The flan looks perfectly round and flat. There are no flan cracks. It is almost perfectly center-struck. From your photo I can't tell very well, but I don't see stress lines from striking, which means it might be pressed or cast. The romans did make some very immaculate coins in those times, but they are not all that common, and fakers often make the most immaculate coins. Always be a bit suspicious of coins like that.   I'd compare the style more, but I'm stuck behind an old 1980's modem on a land line. Go look at more of this type at wildwinds or other places, and see what you think of the art work.  These bronze coins were normally not well struck, because they were the lowest denomination.

AncientCoins,2ye83a,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Mon Mar 9 07:27:06 2015 UTC,"It's not likely that a faker would advertise their coins here, because they would fear of having knowledgeable ancients people evaluating their coin.  The romans minted millions of coins over hundreds of years, so those are pretty common, and of pretty good art work. I read that some of the bigger roman mints knocked out 20,000 coins per day. Bronze roman coins from 100 to 400 AD are very common and you can get a nice looking, readable  one for $15.  It is very unlikely to get a fake from an old on-line dealer who has a web site showing their coins. Thousands of people look at their on-line coins and would immediately notify the dealer or other people if a fake was seen. Go hit the Vcoins web site of dozens of dealers, it is pretty safe. The prices will all be ""full retail"", so you aren't going to get a bargin, but you can be assured that you won't get a fake."

See my main concern is that, with ancient coins mixed with my lack of experience with them, I would buy a replica or a fake thinking that it's real. Are there any that I should really keep My eye out for?   And I just recently purchased a Bronze a Roman ancient, which is my first ever so I'm pretty excited for that :)"
AncientCoins,2ye83a,aSocialPiranha,2,Mon Mar 9 16:07:11 2015 UTC,"One easy thing to do, if you have the coin in hand, is to check the edge for a seam from casting.  Ancient coins were struck with a mallet, not poured into a cast.   Not every fake will have a seam, but an ancient with a seam is most likely a fake."
AncientCoins,2ye83a,ghsgjgfngngf,1 point,Tue Mar 10 04:47:18 2015 UTC,"Sometimes the faker will grind and polish the seam edge off the coin. That is called ""a worried edge"". If you are familar with how normal coin edges look when a coin is struck, then you will immediately see that a worried edge is abnormal.  There are amateur casts and there are professional casts. Some are pretty obvious, and others are very accurate and hard to pick out. The edge is often a significant clue. Hard to get that right, with the stress lines and cracks of the original.  Tourist fakes are a type of cast coin that are made so a tourist can have a souvenir, They have obvious cast seams and it doesn't matter, because those were not intended to fool people. But, sometimes you get people who try to doctor one up and sell it as real. ""Psssst!, buddy, come here... I have a real ancient coin I will sell you cheap!"". And oddly enough, those obvious fakes that are sold on the street are more expensive than real ancient coins. Then it ends up on ebay. =-}"

AncientCoins,2y995c,jojo32,4,Sat Mar 7 19:58:28 2015 UTC,"Well, people have guessed that this is Byzantine flavored, and it is barbaric imitation. I'll finish this off...  It is a mimic of a Justin I or Justinian I follis. At this time (6th century), the Ostrogoths were minting their own copies of Byzantine coins, and one of the Ostrogoth tribes called Gepids are known for their art style of spiky hair on the coins, so this is probably Gepid. The Gepids had adjoining land to the Byzantine empire, in what is now Transylvania.  This one has that ""S"" in the exergue, where the mint mark should be (usually ""CON"" is there, or other Byzantine mints). I haven't seen that ""S"" used before, but the major city of the land of the Gepids is named Sirmium, so maybe the S stands for that city.  Anyway, it is one of my favorite coins. It's huge and lumpy."

AncientCoins,2xuivw,born_lever_puller,8,Tue Mar 3 23:57:12 2015 UTC,"Here are some of my observations and guesses about this coin:  The silver flaking off is commonly called ""fouree"". It is a thin silver coating and often delaminates from the underlying metal.  Romans commonly would issue bronze coins with a fouree coating, and those are official issue. They did this during times of inflation so the coins could be made cheaper, but not diminish in size.  This is a shekle, and there were never any official fourees made of them, that I know of. Therefore it is either an ancient coutnterfeit or a antique fake or a modern fake. http://counterfeitcoins.reidgold.com/fourrees.html  Ancient coutnerfeiters used bronze as the underlying metal. This metal appears to be what is commonly called ""pot metal"" and was used to make pots and pans in the post ancient times. It is often a alloy of lead, tin, and who knows what else. It has that characterisitc grey look, and attempting to plate it most always ends up in delamination.  Modern fakers normally don't use this method.  So based on all the above, I think this coin is an antique fake, possibly no more than several hundred years old."

AncientCoins,2xjpbm,khaominer,3,Sun Mar 1 08:43:47 2015 UTC,"Welcome the the wonderful world of dirties! You have to have patience and a sense of adventure to play this game. I love it and have done a few thousand. I hum the song ""History Detective"" or sometimes the theme song from ""Indiana Jones"" while cleaning them. =-} Cleaning dirties is like slowly unwrapping a christmas present, over weeks or years. then you have the excitement of having to research it yourself, having been the first person to have seen this coin for a couple millenia.  First off, all dirties are culls. Cull means that somebody has looked them over and picked out the obvious cherries, and sold the rest to a dealer. The dealer looked them over, got second pick, and sold them to you. What you are hoping for is that they missed something. The ones they missed will be the ones that are so dirty that they either couldn't see how good it was, or they might have suspected it could be good but didn't think it was worth the effort to clean them. Sometimes a group of dirties will also contain some coins from the dealers slug box, he is just trying to get rid of some of his junk. When you play this game, you will end up with a slug box, too. When you see somebody advertise that they have not been picked over, then you know you are either dealing with somebody who is a liar or naive. If you see anybody touting ""Some people found GOLD!"", then run away fast. =-}  The really dirty coins that also have a hard encapsulation are often called ""crusties"". When they have this encapsualting shell, it can be a bad thing because the crust is the copper that has eroded and migrated away from the surface of the coin, and joined with dirt, creating a very hard shell. The up side of that is the shell has obscured the coin from the culling process, so you might find something pretty interesting when you finally dig down to find the coin. Crusties can have a big pay off, or you might just get a bunch of corroded slugs. Real dirties are always a crap shoot.  The coin you show has the patina come off right down to the raw copper. When you clean it, you will find it ends up ""mottled"", meaning partially patina, and partial copper. It will look terrible at first because the cpper will be too shiney, but the copper will oxidize and tone down to a dull brown, making it look better with age.   Go ahead and clean everything at first, even the ones that seem like slugs. I've had coins that I thought were worn slugs, and slowly something started to come out of it. remember that the ones that seem like slug, but are actually nice coins, are the ones that also fooled the cullers.  People have a lot of different methods of cleaning, all the way from the super fast method of ""zapping"" with electrolysis, to very slow soak and scrub with toothbrush. I prefer the slow methods myself. Zapped coins are striped down to raw copper, blowing away the patina. Sometimes the patina of green copper is all that contains the detail of the coin, so by zapping you have blown it down to a slug.  How are you going to clean these? There is no ""right"" answer, and some people get pretty hyper about cleaning methods. I belive in slow patience, soak a week, scrub with tooth brush, wash, pick, pick, pick, soak another week. Some people don't have this patience. I've tried zapping, just for the experience, and don't like the result. that's my personal opinion, your opinion may be different. Other people use acids and other harsh chemicals. I gave one to a chemist at work and he came back with a very shiney copper coin. It was terrible, but he seemed very proud of it, so I said, ""wow, that was fast, nice coin"". =-}  Oh, one last thing... when you get the dirties, you need to know which ones you want to NOT scrub down the dirt. Some coins look good with a two-tone cleaning of having some of the dirt on the ""field"" areas and the green copper patina highlighting the features of the coin. Don't soak those for a week, because you might mess those up. Those need very careful cleaning."
AncientCoins,2xjpbm,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Sun Mar 1 14:26:14 2015 UTC,"Wow! Thank you for this, I've done a lot of reading on the matter but this is one of the best explanations I've read!  After reading a lot and watching a lot, I think the hardest thing about diving in is understanding what should be left alone, soaked, poked, etc.  I think this explanation covers that very well.  I believe slow and steady is the only way I can go as I am most concerned with damaging them.  I'm sure it will happen as part of the learning process, but I would rather be patient than destroy a piece of history.  I have one that looks like real junk, but after soaking the encrustation is a slightly different color than the patina.  It still looks like a mess to the naked eye, but under a magnifying glass I'm starting to see a highly detailed crown, nose, and chin poking out.  When I got it, I couldn't see anything or tell which side was front or back.  The encrustation is still quite hard and it's definitely going to be a slow process, but very interesting and exciting.  I think you highlighted the fun I see in the idea very well.  To see a piece of history that no one has seen for a thousand years and restore it with care that likely won't ever be taken.  Thanks for your insight!"
AncientCoins,2xjpbm,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Mon Mar 2 00:36:01 2015 UTC,"Some general rules... Metal tools and harsh tools can be poked and scraped on dirt and encrustation, but should never come in contact with the patina that is directly on the coin. Harsh  tools I commonly use are exacto knife, fingernail file, jewlers screwdriver, dremel tool with stone attachment, and vibrating needle tool.  Those types of tools can be used when you are far away from the coin surface, and are blasting through big lumps of encrustation. As you get closer, you need to go slower with more gentle tools. When you get down close to the real patina, then switch to wood and plastic, something softer than the patina. Wooden tooth picks, wooden skewers (for cooking), plastic toothpicks, etc. When you use these tools use small circular rubbing and see if anyhting comes up. To do the poking, just tap on the encrustation with the tip of an exacto, and see if tiny grain sized chunks pop off. If you are close to the patina and nothing seems to want to come off, then back into the bath it goes for another week of soak.   Yeah, your first coins might end up with nicks. You need to get a feel for how aggressive you can get without hitting the underlying patina. Knowing what the coin is can help when you get close to finishing it off, because then you know where the detailed features are.  Dive in, the water's fine! =-}"
AncientCoins,2xjpbm,antiquarian_bookworm,3,Mon Mar 2 01:13:56 2015 UTC,"Oh, one more thing to watch out for in the dirties market... it's a scam called ""re-dirtied coins"". A person takes their slug box coins, puts mud on them, and then sells them as dirties.   You can tell you got stung by that when you put the coins in the weekly bath, and ALL the dirt falls off in a day. The other sign is that all the coins have the same texture and color of dirt on them. Although it is possible that all the coins came from the same small area and have the same dirt, you will find most dirty lots are gathered over a wide area and they have slightly different colored dirt on them.  Another thing you will find, even in good dirty lots, is a coin that somebody has ""peeked"" at. They took an exacto knife and worn down throuh the dirt a one or two small areas to try to figure out what the coin is. They took a peek, didn't like it, and threw it into the dirties coins for sale.  Smoetimes you also find buttons, and other metal chunks that aren't coins. I've found some odd and interesting things."
AncientCoins,2xjpbm,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Sun Mar 1 14:37:19 2015 UTC,"I did get a few peeked coins which is sad, obviously were cut down past the patina in a small area on each side.  I also got a few that had no dirt at all, looked like slugs but have almost completely worn away detail that is visible.  Was not something I expected to see in an uncleaned lot, and am not sure what to make of that and the seller.  Others within it were plenty dirty and they were completely spotless copper."

AncientCoins,2xj8eo,gordie44,3,Sun Mar 1 07:13:12 2015 UTC,"Scans. I dont know why it scanned so dark. I bought them at my LCS. I bought a TON of ancients there recently, these included and there are a TON MORE THERE! I bought this batch of about 36 coins for $110, so I averaged $3 a coin. I don't think any of them are worse than these, but also I got some really nice stuff in that lot."
AncientCoins,2xj8eo,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Sun Mar 1 07:24:09 2015 UTC,"If you are getting these for ~$3, then you are getting a very good deal.  You should try putting a colored piece of paper over the coins before scanning them. Some scanners have an automatic adjustment of exposure, and when the background is mostly white, then dark objects become under exposed. With a darker background, the scanner with shift its expose to do a better job of picking up dark objects. You can do this same trick with cameras that have automatic exposure control. The rule is: shoot dark objects on a dark background, shoot light objects on a light background.  And if you use a color that is not in the object, then you can use software to automatically cut out that color, bringing it back to being a white background. That's the idea behind ""blue screen"" or ""green screen"". The person in the screen can't wear blue pants, or it will clip out their pants and they will appear to be a half person.  And most coins are shot with angled light, usually from the top left of the coin. The angling gives better view of the shallow details, giving a bit of 3D to the image, picking up more detail.  Otherwise, you are really going with all burners on. Nice coins."
AncientCoins,2xj8eo,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Sun Mar 1 13:31:54 2015 UTC,"I definitely will be going back for more. There is a ton there! Thanks for the tips on scanning, that makes a lot of sense. What is strange is that I used the same scanner on some other coins and scanned on my Mac at 2400 dpi and they came out properly exposed. I scanned this image on my pc at either 1200 or 600 dpi and it came out like this. Strange!"

AncientCoins,2xf0zm,jonny_pidgeon,3,Sat Feb 28 01:15:26 2015 UTC,"There are cheaper examples and expensive examples in both categories. I've got coins in both categories that I paid less than $10 or less for and others I paid over $100 for. I'd say Roman coins are more plentiful but there are plenty of Hellenistic coins out there as well. I recommend Vcoins. I have not ordered from any UK-based dealers there, though. Also, check out the coins4sale subreddit, I have got some really great deals from people there. For ancients, I highly recommend /u/BeastyBeast, /u/Whizb4ng, /u/Batwing97 off the top of my head. Dunno much about the UK specifically, I think Roma Numismatics is based out of the UK. The auction sites I frequent are Agora Auctions and CNG, in fact I've spent ~$150 on Agora in the past month alone. I pretty much exclusively buy ancients online. Very few of my LCS have ""interesting"" ancients(plenty of cheap late Roman bronze but that gets old quick) around here and those that do tend to be overpriced."
AncientCoins,2xf0zm,Red_Spork,5,Sat Feb 28 01:33:00 2015 UTC,"If you are just starting out, I would recommend staying away from eBay and looking more into sites like Vcoins, Agora Auctions, and VAuctions as mentioned above. Some of my favorite coins have been purchased at coin shows, as you can sometimes find more favorable deals in person. I would check out local coin shows in the UK to find dealers that primarily are concerned with ancient coins. They will be the most knowledgeable and will be able to find coins that fit your collection and budget, as it is a smaller community than modern coins and dealers often remember their customers."
AncientCoins,2xf0zm,batwing97,3,Sat Feb 28 02:04:21 2015 UTC,I'll be selling a small number of imperial roman denarii again soon on /r/Coins4Sale - not that you have to recommend me ;)  Just need to look through my coins and see what to part with - and what to charge.
AncientCoins,2xf0zm,EvilCartyen,3,Sat Feb 28 13:48:00 2015 UTC,"All the above advice covers things pretty well. I can add that MY local coin shop is WAY marked up above the internet prices. I occassionally buy something low end just to pay for all the browsing I do.  I've never seen a good price in an antique shop. Normally people like that don't carry ancients and the few that I have seen in those shops, the price was absurdly high. They don't know what it is."
AncientCoins,2xf0zm,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Sat Feb 28 13:53:08 2015 UTC,"Buy it nows, wherever you find them, will always be more expensive than auctions, unless someone prices it wrong and you are the first to see it.  The reason is obvious - anytime you see a coin for sale, no one that's seen it has though the price was worth it for them.  So unless you are desperate or have developed an irrational attachment for a coin, you probably won't want to pay it either.  Auctions are different - the listing has a finite time, and (sensibly priced coins at least) are being offered for less than many are willing to pay for them.  There's the madhouse of ebay too, where pervasive fear of fakes and fraud keep prices depressed.  Fancy auction houses are more reliable and usually the bidding goes higher. But not ALWAYS.  Example: there's several emperors and empresses who have DIANA LVCIFERA on the reverse of their coins.  They are plentiful and lots of (apparently) genuine ones come up on ebay all the time.  I have high confidence that I can get a pretty good one (but not a great one) for 2/3 what I'd have to pay for a listing I saw on sixbids.com.  That is balanced with pervasive shill bidding that happens on ebay.  Even some reputable dealers who know their coins well will do it - it's just too profitable.  So coins like the iconic Athens Owl - I think most any auction that starts at $1 for those will be shill-bid to the moon.  Anyone foolish enough to set a low start price on their coin and not shield-bid it will have a bidding war, but unless they have loads of feedback, they will probably be disappointed in the result.  So sixbid owls might in some cases be much mess expensive for their quality.  (When I am selling a coin on ebay, rather than cheating with shill bidding, I start by setting the auction with the lowest price I would be willing to accept for a coin, and hope for a bidding war.)  For a beginner, don't spend a lot of money on any one coin - you're less likely to make an expensive mistake that you can't get out of.  < $50 is a good bellweather.  And anyway, it's good to get experience with all kinds of coins and you can get a pile of interesting ones for less than a dollar each, if you're prudent and patient.  Less likely to fall for a fake too.  I've been collecting for almost two years and am only now starting to dabble in pricier stuff (pricy for me anyway, since I already carry the mantle of r/ancientcoins designated bottom feeder)."
AncientCoins,2xf0zm,manpace,2,Sat Feb 28 17:55:06 2015 UTC,"Good advice about staying below $50 at first. Especially if you go to ebay. Most of the fakes are above that price. I think that is why I have so few fakes, I just can't afford them. =-} I go for quantity rather than quality.  At vcoins and other reputable dealers you have very little to fear of fakes. Those dealers quickly remove anything that might smear their reputation, and they monitor eachother. Ebay is afloat with fakes."
AncientCoins,2xf0zm,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Sat Feb 28 18:37:40 2015 UTC,"I think you overestimate the amount of shill-bidding on Ebay. Many (but not all, of course) coins reach prices that are quite high, without any shill-bidding. Sometimes coins sell for very little but quite often I'm positively surprised by what I sell coins for. Prices I would not have dared ask as fixed prices. And of course, the big advantage, every coin sells. Better to make a loss on some coins than to spend years trying to find a buyer willling to pay the asking price.  Athens tetradrachms don't need shill-bidding to reach high prices. It's a type that I feel is way overrated. I have owned maybe 10 in my collecting carreer and though there were some decent ones, I didn't keep any. What I could get for them was more than they were worth to me."
AncientCoins,2xf0zm,ghsgjgfngngf,1 point,Sat Feb 28 18:35:20 2015 UTC,"I used to think it wasn't so pervasive but have had to change my thinking.  Ebay doesn't do anything about it.  Some sellers don't even care, they'll sell the same coin over and over for substantial amounts, relisting it right after the old listing ended.  Here is a silly fake, with two listings in the past 60 days and many more before that.  It's not being listed anymore because I think it finally got a real bid - The seller had been running the price up to GBP 500 on his listings, but the most recent auction ended at just GBP 130.  If it had been legit it could have gone for GBP 1000 or more.  But why should sellers care?  Ebay won't do anything.  I have reported sellers for pervasive shilling and nothing happened.  If they are power sellers ebay lets them alone.  Anytime I see a coin sold, and then listed for sale again, I assume the seller is shilling - at least if it happens with regularity.  It's possible that the coin was returned or the buyer never paid, that can happen.  But if it happens a lot...  The other red flags are tons of bids, early on.  Bidding wars when there are five days left in the auction, or clowns who bid fifteen small increments one after another rather than entering the amount they are willing to pay.  And all done by buyers with 50-300 feedback.  ""Wow, 25 bids!  Everyone wants in on this one!""  And then you look at the bidding and it's the same guy who did 21 of them.  These things make coins look like they are in high demand.  Oh, and people who set the bid histories of their coins to PRIVATE so you can't even see the anonymized buyer information.  People who do that should be written off as shillers.  These things seem to happen all the time on some sellers coins, and never ever on others who are listing similar items.  There's lots of people selling ancient coins on ebay that don't shill bid.  But it's so lucrative that plenty of sellers indulge.  The default attitude when you see any of the stuff above is that the demand is manufactured.  Never ever assume that just because there's a bid on a coin for $XXX that there is a person out there willing to pay it.  There's plenty of demand on ebay for the owl coins.  I think that's because it's a beginner coin and that's where most beginners congregate - they tend to make a big impression and once a person's been collecting for while they'll already have acquired one.  So when a marginal piece comes up on sixbid, an ugly duckling with flaws to go with charms, interest won't be substantial."

AncientCoins,2xazsa,MartiVltori,3,Fri Feb 27 05:46:03 2015 UTC,"Agreed. This would be a very expensive coin even in this condition if real. Although it doesn't scream fake at me, it has a ton of wear and would need to be looked at by an expert in aurei."
AncientCoins,2xazsa,pmstacker,3,Fri Feb 27 05:54:23 2015 UTC,Yep. It is not a die match of the fake above but one thing that bothers  me is the crudeness of ORIENS and it appears quite misaligned. All examples I see of this coin the OREINS legend is executed quite straight and evenly.
AncientCoins,2xazsa,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Fri Feb 27 05:58:17 2015 UTC,"Some of that can be attributed to the wear on the coin. Here is an example of a different coin with a similar reverse legend/device with moderate wear. The OP coin has even more wear, and it is not unusual for the legend to flatten out. This by no means is evidence that the coin is authentic. It is much easier to counterfeit coins with heavier wear, as it is easier to hide the imperfections of casting. Another concern I have is that so much of the legend is missing and the weird looking rim damage. It is possible the OP coin was shaved at some point. This is also another trick used to hide the casting process."

AncientCoins,2xazsa,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Fri Feb 27 05:24:25 2015 UTC,It looks like a crudely made cast. Details really soft and mushy.
AncientCoins,2xazsa,ghsgjgfngngf,1 point,Fri Feb 27 05:41:10 2015 UTC,"Ah, ok. I was looking at the edgework, and something just seemed ""off"" about it. Can't articulate it, but that's all I really saw :\"
AncientCoins,2xazsa,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Fri Feb 27 05:44:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, look at the lower left of the obverse. That ridge of material sticking up... that's not right. And also follow around the rim of the coin and you see this drastic change in texture at the edge, almost like it was filled in. One mistake you will find with cast coins is that the caster will often try to fill out the edge of the coin to make it more round, fill in defects. Another tell tale sign is when a edge crack is different on one side than the other. Unfortunately this coin has no flan cracks to tell the story, but maybe it did have cracks and they have been leveled out?  And the cast like softness mentioned is true. Normally a worn coin has sharpness left somewhere, in a coin of this condition. But there is none.  And the style of ORIENS on the one side is a pretty modern font, not the roman font that is on the obverse, as mentioned above. That's pretty suspicious. Also, it seems pretty ""squeezed into"" the design, as if it were an afterthought. That's not how coins were made. Around the ORIENS it looks like the material has been leveled by the caster, to force that lettering into the design.  All that negative stuff said, I have been fooled before, so don't take this as proof. I've seen what sure looked like fakes, and they were verified by experts. I've seen what looked very real, and it was condemned as a fake. To be an expert you have to have a lot of handling of real examples of exactly that coin type. I'm not familiar with this type.  And more tell-tale signs can be drawn from examining the edge of the coin. Sometimes a casting sprue, or seam is visible. Or the caster may have worn the evidence off, leaving a filed or polished edge."

If just one person, it will only go for the starting bid.  Acsearch shows all the auction prices for these coins.  I will search out my coins by RIC or inscription, rank by price, and then look for the ballpark price of coins in similar shape as mine.  There's my price.  If there's only one or two on there, it's a rare variation so even harder to price.  Just being rare doesn't make it valuable - if it's an obscure coin type that no one really cares about.  But if someone out there HAS to have it, they will pay whatever you want.  Also look at ebay sale prices last sixty days.  Some of them are shill bid so it's no guarantee of price.  Also asking prices on vcoins, and active auctions on sixbids."
AncientCoins,2xbgv1,ghsgjgfngngf,1 point,Fri Feb 27 08:16:22 2015 UTC,"The price you might get is often determined by condition. In the field of modern coins, this definition of ""condition"" is pretty strictly defined because modern coins are practically identical when they are minted. They use a written grading system. But with ancients we don't have strict definitions of grading, because there are so many variations of the original state of the coin when it was minted and what the millenia have done to create a patina. So folks in the ancients go more by vague ""how's this look to you?"" kind of thing.  A friend of mine at work was a moderns collector, and when I showed him my ancients and he was frustrated that there was no defined grading system and there were ""too many variations"". =-} Those are the things I LIKE about ancients."

AncientCoins,2wujkh,EvilCartyen,2,Mon Feb 23 08:14:27 2015 UTC,"Ancient coins were struck from a number (in this case, as with most Roman Imperial coins) a great number of handmade dies. The exact placement of design elements and things like the angle at which an arm is held are generally not important enough to make two coins 'different'. It is not always clear, without in-depth knowledge when a difference is important. Generally, legend breaks don't matter but when it comes to 'Late Romans' they do matter and are usually deliberate."
AncientCoins,2wujkh,lacedaimon,3,Mon Feb 23 11:58:34 2015 UTC,"So as someone who recently started attributing ancients, how did you do it? Just look through books at every picture till you find a match?"
AncientCoins,2wujkh,lacedaimon,5,Mon Feb 23 07:25:49 2015 UTC,"I use acsearch, vcoins, and wildwinds a lot. It gets much easier with time! But you have to put in the hours, hundreds of them."
AncientCoins,2wujkh,gordie44,3,Mon Feb 23 07:29:53 2015 UTC,"So I started with posting them, and having people identify them for me. I checked their ID against my coin to deduce how they arrived there. Much easier on a nicer coin of course. If it was one of my more poorer coins I looked up a proper example and compared the attribution. There are some coins, like this one: http://imgur.com/wVokwKd rev: http://imgur.com/ii3PTgJ which are very clear and easy to read the legend. BUTTTTTT!!!! The problem is the spacing. If you don't search the legend with the right spacing, it wont come up. So I kept hearing about wildwinds and started with just typing in the rulers name. This one being ANTONINVS. From there i scroll through the thumbnail page (important detail there) and look for reverses that are similar. If the reverse has a legend, I do a ctrl+f so it narrows it down and I can see, oh, only 19 have that reverse inscription. Then just look for the right picture. On the reverse of this coin it only has SC which MOST seem to have. So I search an attribute. I noticed from coins that were ID'd for me they always had descriptors. So for my reverse I noted ""standing right"" or ""holding shield"". You cntrl+f that and narrow it down there. Further, I just learned a little more about denominations. If you know the denomination, you can search just those. I found a little chart that illustrates weights, sizes, and metal type to tell you the denomination. This is my attribution for this coin:    Antoninus Pius. AE Sestertius. Struck 145-161 AD. Rome. Obv: ANTONINVS AVG PIVS PP TRP COS IIII, laureate head right Rev: SC. Minerva advancing right brandishing javelin & holding shield.  RIC 779, rated common; Cohen 745; Sear (2000) 4220.  (though as I said, I just learned about denominations and sestertius is supposed to be 25-30 grams and mine is only like 12. So I guess this is an As, or a dupondius. I have to re-look this one up)  So that is where I am now. That doesn't help me for coins without inscriptions, or partial inscriptions, or illegible inscriptions. Sometimes they are legible, just not to me!"
AncientCoins,2wujkh,antiquarian_bookworm,6,Mon Feb 23 07:43:00 2015 UTC,"Working late tonight, let me grab my RIC volume III and I'll explain how this works as I go along.  First, I have to say this is a nice example. It's a good VF, I say this because the coin is relatively well centered, it's well struck, the dies are fairly fresh (as can be seen in the fine detail on both sides) and the portrait of Antoninus Pius is nice, even artistic, the strike is bold, and the relief looks pretty high, the only major flaw is that the flan is not as ideally round as you would want it to be, and there is the cupric oxide on the reverse.   There was some on the obverse initially on the high-points, but that was successfully removed, yet left some scarring and pitting (but that's okay). And finally the coins details are, well, very fine by definition. This example of this coin is probably better than most that you might find out there, but let me further explain first:  The color falls into the sort of brown, or perhaps chocolate-brown category which is always nice, and the reverse has some cupric oxide which is the red color you see. This is an effect of the coin being chemically cleaned. Most likely hydrochloric acid. Nasty, terrible stuff, but if you know how to use it properly on a coin-to-coin basis it can be a good friend.  The coin has it's issues, but it shows all of its flaws, which for someone like myself, makes this a coin I would want. There's no smoothing, no strengthening, no tooling. I can deal with a bit of the first two, but no one should buy a tooled coin, ever, IMO.  Downsides are, the coin is pitted, especially on the reverse, this is because of the way it was cleaned more than likely. The final layer of patina (the cupric oxide) broke through the metal, and when this one was cleaned, the reverse was a little over cooked so to speak.   Still, the red can be carefully removed, and a nice even color can be obtained if you wanted.  Let's get to denominations. This is an ""As"", I pronounce it as if I were saying ""as"" if I were saying. It's not an ass, it's an as. How do you know it's an as?    It's copper in color, and in material. All denominations struck in copper for this time period (1st and 2nd cent. AD. though I'm generalizing here) were the as and semis. I can't remember about the quadrans at the moment. I think some were copper some weren't? It has a laureate, wreathed bust, and it weighs under 14 grams. A sestertius, as you correctly mentioned would be heavier, and worth 4 times the amount in its day, and would have the same bust type and even legend. Two Asses =a dupondius, Two dupondi = a sestertius... It's not a dupondius because a dupondius will almost always have a ""radiate bust"", (radiates almost always signify double the standard denomination) and the metal will be  (though usually you can't tell because of patina) is made of a brassy material called orichalcum, and so is the sestertius. It's a goldish metal, sort of like brass, a lot like brass actually. So we've established that it is an As.   Next is the attribution. Roman Imperial Coinage is the standard, and if you have a couple of grand to buy the entire set I highly recommend having them, they pay themselves off time and again. An ancient coin without an attribution is for the pawn shops. If you're going to buy a single volume, buy vol. I, it's not as expensive, and is a good one to start learning on, plus has great coins in plates.  Because this comment has gone on way too long as it is, and explaining how to attribute using RIC is not exactly a simple task, especially considering almost every volume has a different method, I'm just going to skip to the very basics.  This is Antoninus Pius, and though others used his name as part of their name, you can't mistaken that face. Same goes for most early emperors when the quality of the art still mattered.  The coin is dated on the obverse (though it belongs to a vaguely dated series) -COS IIII (fourth consulship) of Antoninus Pius. There are 1410 coins listed in RIC for A. Pius.   I skip to the 4th year of COS and go to the correct denomination. I match up the obverse legend with the bust type, then the reverse type S-C Minerva...  Found it fairly quickly, and here is the attribution for your coin.  Antoninus Pius,  Æ As, mint of Rome, struck circa 145-161 A.D.  Obverse: ANTONINVS AVG PI-VS P P TR P COS III.  Laureate head of Antoninus Pius right.  Reverse: S - C   Minerva (Athena) standing right, brandishing javalin and holding shield.  R.I.C. 826  (listed as C for common).  If this were a sestertius and in this condition, you would be looking at a $350-400 coin (or more), but it's what we call a ""middle bronze"" which do not do as well unless they are exceptional, because people want big, heavy ancient coins.   This one is nice, but it's not a 9 or a 10. The coin is worth about $60-80 as it is, which isn't bad, and could do higher if it were sold by CNG for example. They would probably get close to $200 for it.  If it were my coin, I would definitely spend the time to clean it and restore it to its full potential, and get it to look as close to a 10 as possible.  Well, if you have other nice coins like this I would recommend getting them properly attributed. The legends aren't always so important, it's the overall appeal of the coin that is important.   Whatever it is you're looking to do with your coins, let me/us at reddit know, I can most likely either help you directly or guide you to the right path. And I'm always looking to buy nice coins!  tl/dr; explaining the basics in assessing an ancient coin. I realize as I'm explaining, that it's not so easy to explain with a few words. Sorry, and I hope it helps someone out there."
AncientCoins,2wujkh,Red_Spork,2,Mon Feb 23 10:53:10 2015 UTC,"Hello, Very informative! I did notice those red spots on the back and was not sure what they are from. I would be nice to remove them if I could so they are more evenly colored and it has more eye appeal. While this is not likely my most valuable ancient, it is definitely my favorite because it is so well preserved. Thanks for clarifying the denominations. I was wondering what As was. For some reason I thought it must be abbreviated. That little picture I found that talks about the different denominations clarified that this must not be sestertius, but it did not say anything about dupondis being radiate only (or atleast mostly). I guess it is understandable that I didnt find my exact coin (As) on wildwinds, but it IS common, right?     So you recommend getting them properly attributed. What do you mean? Get them certified and graded? I cant really afford that. But if you mean attribute correctly, I think I can do that! I am still learning as you see. I might sell a couple of them, but I dont know what to ask usually. And most people want a deal, and don't want to spend too much.

AncientCoins,2wujkh,antiquarian_bookworm,3,Tue Feb 24 05:44:37 2015 UTC,"I'm going to have to get back to you with a more throrough reply later.   You don't have to get these things slabbed or graded.  The 9 coins in this photo are all of uncleaned, or partially cleaned coins.  The Severus Alexander you sold for $60 is not an As it's a sestetius, and that's a good price to get for it, they're very common.  There are a couple of coins that are pretty rare in this photo. The one underneath the S. Alexander sestertius is an As of Trebonianus Gallus, and has the reverse of DACIA S C. It's rare denomination for the time period. The coin in the center with the galley is interesting, and if it has more detail under that crust and cleans up well, could be a relatively valuable coin.  Bottom center coin is a dupondius of Trajan (again uncleaned), the reverse is Victory inscribing a shield with VIC/DAC this coin commemorates Trajan's victory over the Dacians. Pretty cool coin, but would be tough to clean.  To help you out a little:  From top, right to left:  1.Probus billon tetradrachm from Alexandria Egypt.   Volusion sestertius (scarcer emperor, but not that hot). Maximianus, follis. completely uncleaned, and probably in good condition, would need a lot of effort to clean and get it to look good though. You know this one. Hadrian, sestertius galley reverse. looking at it again, I think it's pretty shot, but still a good coin and might clean up alright. Oticalia Severa sestertius. Solid green patina, would clean up well under a microscope. I said Trebonianus Gallus but the Dacia reference wouldn't make sense. It's Trajan Decius. And it's still a rare type considering the denomination. Patina is not really there, and the coin is porous, but still a cool coin that you don't see very often at all. Trajan dupondius... Too late of time period for me. I don't deal in these.   Hope this helps. I gotta run. Good luck. I would recommend anyone that likes cleaning uncleaned coins to buy some of these. They're a lot better than the late Roman stuff that's on eBay. These are actually decent uncleaned coins."

AncientCoins,2wsfv3,EvilCartyen,3,Sun Feb 22 20:54:34 2015 UTC,"Wowee wow wow! That's it! Fantastic job, Red_Spork! I searched Wildwinds until my eyes bled, and couldn't find a match. Thanks so much to everyone!"
AncientCoins,2wsfv3,jojo32,2,Sun Feb 22 20:59:25 2015 UTC,Yep. I have an Elagabalus coin. Thought the portrait looked familiar.
AncientCoins,2wsfv3,Beastybeast,4,Sun Feb 22 21:50:12 2015 UTC,"Looks like Nikopolis ad Istrum, Caracalla, Moushmov 1116  It's on wildwinds here: http://wildwinds.com/coins/greece/moesia/nikopolis/i.html  I see the differences on the reverse though. I'll try if I can find an exact match."
AncientCoins,2wsfv3,Beastybeast,3,Sun Feb 22 20:25:12 2015 UTC,"That one is very close. I had wondered if it was Caracalla, but the eagle's position didn't match anything I saw."
AncientCoins,2wsfv3,EvilCartyen,3,Sun Feb 22 20:53:52 2015 UTC,"Red_Spork just found it, check it out! :)"
AncientCoins,2wsfv3,Beastybeast,3,Sun Feb 22 20:54:35 2015 UTC,"I've hit a dead end on this one, the reverse shows an eagle standing on an altar between two standards. I've found some similar reverses, but none exactly like this. It weighs 11 grams and measures 26 mm. Thanks for any help! Pic of reverse: http://i.imgur.com/bU9lYJ3.jpg"
AncientCoins,2wsfv3,EvilCartyen,2,Sun Feb 22 19:59:17 2015 UTC,"Looks like a Severus Alexander bust. Could it be a provincial issue of him? And can you try and transcribe the legend?  Edit: Agree with BeastyBeast, looks like we're close to this  Edit2: Other similar designs  EDIT3: Bust also reminds me of Gordian III"
AncientCoins,2wrlyk,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Sun Feb 22 15:45:08 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's a really nice way to display them. Surely more interesting and eye-catching than either Ganesh or the coins by themselves."

Believe it or not, that's pretty representative, and legion XV is not an error, notice the ghostly ""V"" that you can just barely see to the right of the ""X"", due likely to worn dies I'm told.

AncientCoins,2wn2u1,EvilCartyen,3,Sat Feb 21 09:57:55 2015 UTC,"Very cool! I have a black Lucius Verus, almost totally black in hand - and a few more black (I suppose they're really uncleaned) denarii incoming - a nice Trajan Divus Pater for instance. I'll post it when I get it."

AncientCoins,2wn2u1,GeneralAgrippa,3,Sun Feb 22 09:58:26 2015 UTC,Nice looking Antony. I've had trouble finding the higher numbered legions for a good price. LEG XIII is the highest legion I have.
AncientCoins,2wkcr1,alazi,7,Fri Feb 20 17:15:19 2015 UTC,I have no confidence in those denarii.
AncientCoins,2wkcr1,manpace,5,Sat Feb 21 00:15:16 2015 UTC,I believe his coins are fake. Especially this one looks really unconvincing. Also that Vitellius with the horrible portrait. This one is pretty bad too.  Casts with fake patinas.
AncientCoins,2wkcr1,Beastybeast,3,Sat Feb 21 01:23:43 2015 UTC,Noticed this new seller on eBay from Greece offering great coinage for the sub-$30 range. Red flags going off all over the place for me personally but wanted some input.   This user is not on the following list: http://augustusmath.hypermart.net/fakesellers.html  I use this list often as a sanity-check but then again seller has only sold 25 items to-date  Can anyone identify any glaring issues with the authenticity of this coin?
AncientCoins,2wkcr1,batwing97,4,Fri Feb 20 17:17:18 2015 UTC,"Did you check the list at Forvm? Fake coin sellers often make new ebay accounts and it is impossible to keep those list absolutely current.  Are the seller's reviews public? How do the seller's other coins look? I for one, would rather miss out on a potential good deal if there's a relatively good chance I'm buying a fake.  If it's to good to be true, it probably is."
AncientCoins,2wkcr1,SolarDub,3,Fri Feb 20 17:32:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input, everyone. I'd had a look at some of these, myself. Particularly this, as I love me some nice Ae2/3s.  Alas, I shall watch, but steer clear right now."
AncientCoins,2wkcr1,batwing97,2,Sat Feb 21 19:09:35 2015 UTC,"The thing is that those look fine to me.  This seller could have both genuines and fakes. As far as I know, these AE2/3s haven't been faked."
AncientCoins,2wkcr1,esnible,7,Sun Feb 22 17:17:04 2015 UTC,"All of the seller's coins look genuine.  It is against US law to import ancient coins from Greece into the US (except with an unobtainable export certificate, tetradrachms excluded).  It is against Greek law to export ancient coins (except with proof they were originally found outside Greece) or even to collect ancient coins without a license.  If there is a problem these laws will make it hard for you to get a refund.  Furthermore the coins might be seized."
AncientCoins,2wkcr1,batwing97,3,Fri Feb 20 19:51:12 2015 UTC,"http://www.ebay.com/sch/zade-nikol/m.html?_nkw=&_armrs=1&_ipg=&_from=  I disagree, I think that all his ancients look like cast fakes."
AncientCoins,2wkcr1,esnible,2,Fri Feb 20 23:23:35 2015 UTC,"I see flow lines on them, which means genuine or perhaps centrifugal cast fakes, not ordinary fakes. A few of his coins had pimples, which is a sign of fakes, but hard to be sure because there was all kinds of weird dirt and lint on them, suggesting they had all been cleaned by the same process. Feedback was for private auctions, so no way to look at the sold coins."
AncientCoins,2wkcr1,batwing97,3,Sat Feb 21 02:50:43 2015 UTC,"I think it's interesting that all the denarii have the exact same patina, dirt, and field porosities. Definitely a red flag for me. Those flow lines can be put into casts if they are strong enough in the cast. I've definitely seen newer fakes that have flow lines. The fact that this seller had a string of ratings as a buyer then private listings as a seller is even more suspicious. Even if a coin from this seller looked genuine through pictures there is no way I would purchase any coin from this seller."
AncientCoins,2wkcr1,esnible,4,Sat Feb 21 02:59:00 2015 UTC,Agreed.  I have downloaded the sold coins and the ones selling today. I spot-checked against Forum and found nothing from the same molds.  I will check ForgeryNetwork.com tonight.
AncientCoins,2wjde7,EvilCartyen,5,Fri Feb 20 11:23:27 2015 UTC,"I posted it a couple months ago when I first got it, but here's mine.  A lifetime-issue Alexander tetradrachm, minted in Tarsus, in AU condition with some gold toning."

AncientCoins,2wjde7,pmstacker,4,Sat Feb 21 01:26:05 2015 UTC,"My favourite is the one I started with. Bought long ago, thought lost in a divorce, and recently found amongst a bunch of stuff... Not my best quality coin, but most sentimental for me; it began my ancients quest."
AncientCoins,2wjde7,Red_Spork,3,Fri Feb 20 17:31:51 2015 UTC,I've posted it here before but my favorite is definitely my Julius Caesar denarius.

Perhaps Egypt, Tunisia, one of those countries.  http://www.forumancientcoins.com/fakes/displayimage.php?pos=-11253 http://www.forumancientcoins.com/fakes/displayimage.php?pos=-11254  http://www.forumancientcoins.com/fakes/displayimage.php?pos=-11252"

AncientCoins,2wahjq,ghsgjgfngngf,2,Wed Feb 18 18:57:50 2015 UTC,"The surfaces of the larger one make it obvious that it's a cast and not an original struck coin, even without knowledge of the existing cast twins. But if it were a high-quality cast, the existance of those twins alone would also be enough to condemn them. It's a commonly encountered fake, I actually owned one myself at some point that was given to me by someone who had bought it on Ebay as genuine, fortunately very cheaply.  The surfaces of the drachm also look suspicious from the picture."
AncientCoins,2wahjq,dbbequette,1 point,Wed Feb 18 19:04:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah the bottom one is the Alexander The Great drachm, if it is real it is a posthumous drachm. The depiction on the coin isn't actually Alexander the Great himself but Herakles (Hercules) wearing a lion head dress. The reverse is Zeuss."

AncientCoins,2w4edz,Red_Spork,3,Mon Feb 16 22:47:45 2015 UTC,"I can't figure out exactly which one it is. I believe it is one of the earlier hyperpyron issues because various emperors debased them as time went on and that thing is definitely high-karat, but I don't own any of these and don't know enough about them to know where to look when Wildwinds fails me. May /u/BeastyBeast has some ideas, I'm pretty sure he is an actual wizard based on some of the ID's he's made. I found some similar ones from Manuel I but the legend doesn't seem to match."
AncientCoins,2w4edz,Beastybeast,6,Mon Feb 16 22:58:38 2015 UTC,"Aww, thanks ;) I'm not a wizard though, just a guy with a hobby and way too much time on his hands!  It's a histamenon of Constantine X Doukas  The legends are ""+IhS XIS REX - REGNANTInM"" and  ""+ KWN RACL - O DOVKAC""  See SB 1847 DO 1a.  I'd put the value at gold (currently ~$155) plus $100-150 or so."
AncientCoins,2w4edz,Red_Spork,3,Mon Feb 16 23:13:18 2015 UTC,Good catch! I was looking at the completely incorrect set of emperors. Obviously I need to read up on my Byzantine numismatics a bit more.

AncientCoins,2w2roi,mboswi,3,Mon Feb 16 14:12:34 2015 UTC,"Have you checked whether it really is from a Rauch auction? Is there any particular reason you doubt it?  You can use this site to check:  http://www.acsearch.info/  It certainly can't have been in that collection for long, since the auction 95 was in last September. It seems to be one of these: http://www.acsearch.info/search.html?id=2142041  Value is subjective, the person you bought it from paid 210€ plus fees for the lot of three coins. This seems like a good price."
AncientCoins,2w2roi,ghsgjgfngngf,2,Mon Feb 16 15:24:29 2015 UTC,"Looks to be far left from the lot you posted.  Most likely a dealer bought it to sell individually or, like me, they buy a lot of coins, pick out the ones they like and then sell the rest to recoup the cost."
AncientCoins,2w2roi,Whizb4ng,1 point,Mon Feb 16 15:39:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as far as I know, this is the lot it came from.  As for it being a fake or not... well, I'm a noob regarding coins, but I have been collecting other items for some years and I have seen all kind of things, so I like having my items checked by other people. You know, I may be wrong so other opinions are appreciated. I paid 150 euros for it, and it was one of the cheapest real options I could find. Today I don't think it was the best price ever, but I guess it is not a bad one either if I have a look at other sold tets. Anyway, as I have just said, I'm far form being an expert so..."

It's Macedonian, struck onder one of the successors of Alexander. Someone else might be able to identify the exact ruler (as I'm not very familiar with these coins) but I'd lean towards Pyrrhus, Antigonos Gonatas or autonomous, based on similar examples on wildwinds and the monogram (if there is any) on the front, which I can't quite make out."

Some better quality pictures would definitely help to identify the emperor, since this coin is far from hopeless.  Also, most numismatists and collectors use millimeters to describe the size of coins and for coins that aren't perfectly round (like most ancient coins, in fact) you can give two dimensions like you did, or just take the largest diameter (that's how we do it at the coin cabinet in Brussels)  At any rate, a really cool find!"

AncientCoins,2vemf0,iSmokeGauloises,3,Tue Feb 10 10:41:31 2015 UTC,"There are spreadsheets and things but I've never seen a download able database with all the data you'd need for optical recognition. Crawling wildwinds and cross referencing with spreadsheets(since wildwinds data tends towards being unstructured and their Id's come in several different formats, but spreadsheets I've seen are generally quite precise) would not be difficult if you were able to normalize all catalog numbers into some regular format for cross referencing. The real difficulty would be optical recognition as the sheer number of variations is absurd and generally you are only going to have partial legends. There are plenty of series where without legends you are not going to be able to determine the exact coin, just  that it is one of a given series.   Personally, I think a much bigger help would be writing a search that can take advantage of what is out there and search it better. Hell, I'd just about pay for something that would allow me to search within just a given group of emperors, given size range, weight range material, partial legend, etc and use a thesaurus for my description of the obverse and reverse."

Using polar to cartesian distortion on images of the obverse of coins and then using a data set of around 800 letters I cropped out of coins I am already able to detect the letters on many types of coins. When I have a big enough data set of letters and a more accurate detection of the letters I could start classifying which letters are which and then continue to work on detecting the face on the obverse, the picture on the reverse and maybe even the mint mark.   This is one of the more successful results I had so far: A distorted Julia Domna with the letters detected automatically.   I think that when the data set of letters reaches few thousands the results would be very impressive.  Thanks!"
AncientCoins,2vemf0,esnible,2,Tue Feb 17 08:49:37 2015 UTC,"There is nothing like what you are asking for.  If you created such a dataset, I am sure people would enjoy using it.  I have digitized a few numismatic books and have a few hundred images that I could contribute, but nothing like the quantity you want.  There was a well-funded project out of the Vienna Institute of Technology that partnered with the Fitzwilliam Museum to get their database.  Although the team had had major success identifying modern circulating coins their ancient coin recognition was not impressive.  You might be able to partner with some of the hobbyist online sites that have a lot of images and metadata.  CoinProject and Wildwinds spring to mind.  I know some of the operators, let me know if you need an introduction.  It is my belief that, at least in the short term, the best approach for an automatic recognizer is to start with inscriptions.  Optical Character Recognition is pretty advanced, and once you have even a few characters you can feed the OCRs guesses into databases of coin inscriptions.  (Extra credit: the suggestions from the inscription databases can be fed back to train the OCR).  You are right to get a big database, but consider focusing on a particular dataset, such as a particular century of coinage.  I guarantee if you can recognize any, say, 3rd century Roman coins you will quickly find the support to apply your techniques to other cultures."

AncientCoins,2v259r,Red_Spork,8,Sat Feb 7 03:48:59 2015 UTC,"This is another one I've been wanting to pick up basically since I started collecting ancients, a denarius of Julius Caesar. I definitely had to rob the piggy bank for this one but it is well worth it. The most important thing to me was a full, crisp ""CAESAR"" but having a fairly nice elephant and priestly implements was a great bonus. I have no idea what happened to this thing to damage it, but I'd say it got hit with a hammer or trampled under something shortly after minting as the flattening you can see on both sides is pretty similar to some of the Athenian tets that were test cut on a hard surface. Regardless, I am in full on ""Gollum"" mode with this thing at the moment.  Edit: Edited the images slightly to more truly reflect the color of this coin. It has a bit of toning, but not as much as the original would suggest. I really need to learn to use lightroom better."

AncientCoins,2uhnei,Red_Spork,4,Mon Feb 2 05:54:33 2015 UTC,"I think that the person on the forum got it right. Hadrian and Antoninus Pius from Aelia Capitolina. I checked my ""Hendin"" to see if he had it listed, and he doesn't, but there are similar ones.  There were a lot of ""city-coins"" from the region minted at this time, and up to the reign of Gallienus.  If it is, (and I'm sure it is) an Aelia Capitolina mint, then that is pretty nice little find! Congratulations! A historic piece indeed.  After the Jewish/Bar Kochba revolt (The 2nd Jewish War against Rome) was brought to an end, Hadrian renamed Jerusalem ""Aelia Capitolina"", - Aelia being the family name of Hadrian, and Judea, it is said, Hadrian renamed ""Philistia"", however there are no sources that I am aware of that place Hadrian as the one to have renamed it that.   A temple to Jupiter was built in Jerusalem, and Jews were barred from living and even visiting there, except for the 9th of Av, a day which commemorates the destruction of the Temple by Titus and the X legion. If only your coin could talk, it would be priceless!"
AncientCoins,2uhnei,lacedaimon,3,Mon Feb 2 08:38:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info! This is definitely one of the more historic coins in my collection. Believe it or not, I had been researching coins related to Bar Kochba for a bit prior to making this find, hoping to round out my collection with something related to the Jewish wars. I'll probably still pick up one of the Jewish issues but I'm still shocked I found anything related to Bar Kochba in an uncleaned lot."
AncientCoins,2uhnei,born_lever_puller,2,Mon Feb 2 15:27:55 2015 UTC,"Most of the legend is gone on this one, but I can see what looks to be a partial ""CAESAR AVG"" over to the left of the ""obverse"" which I'm currently deeming as the side in the first 3 images.  Diameter is 20mm at the smallest, 22.5mm at the largest. Weight is 9.9 grams.  This came from Crusty Romans' Dardanus hoard which seems to largely be Greek with some early Roman mixed in. It didn't require a lot of cleaning as a light brushing removed most of the dirt after an overnight soak in DW. I may still do some spot work on it with an x-acto knife but I haven't decided yet.  Edit: Someone on another forum I frequent found it. Another example here. JUDAEA, Aelia Capitolina (Jerusalem). Hadrian, with Antoninus Pius as Caesar. AD 138. Æ 20mm. Laureate, draped, and cuirassed bust of Hadrian right / Head of Antoninus right. Meshorer, Aelia 9; Rosenberger 9."

AncientCoins,2ug4ub,TacoPunchster,5,Sun Feb 1 21:45:06 2015 UTC,"As far as IDing, a big part of it is just being able to look at a coin and get the hard work out of the way. Being able to tell a Roman coin from a Greek coin and even knowing that a given coin is Seleucid vs Ptolemaic or that it is likely from a specific area like Ionia. Honestly, all of this just takes time and looking at a lot of coins and if you stay interested in ancients for a long while  you will start to pick it up. I learn a lot just ""window shopping"" and drooling over coins on Vcoins for hours sometimes, personally. Also just opening up Wildwinds, finding a random emperor or city and browsing all their coins with thumbnails enabled.  As far as books, I currently have the old single-volume edition of Sear's ""Roman Coins and Their Values"" and both volumes of ""Greek Coins and Their Values"" and they are great for both IDing coins and getting a basic idea of relative price of various coins(they were written years ago, so current prices will be different). I am planning to pick up Hendin's ""A Guide to Biblical Coins"" soon as well as Hendin really is an expert in that area. He also runs Amphora Coins on eBay/Vcoins BTW. If you can get some old auction catalogs they can be very helpful as well and CNG have some of the best for ancients research IMHO.  For websites: I mentioned Wildwinds above, it really is the first site I'll check usually. Vcoins search is pretty good as well, and has helped me out when Wildwinds didn't have the exact coin I was looking for. CoinProject is a good resource to get to know as well.  Best advice I have, though, is to keep collecting and the rest will come. I enjoy buying unidentified lots and if you can find some that are cheap and seem to have decent detail(this is important) they are great for learning to ID on. Late Roman bronzes are easily the cheapest and most available ancients for this, but they are also the easiest to get bored of IMHO."

On Ebay, cleaned coins of the quality that you can expect to get out of your uncleaneds, sell for anywhere from not at all to $5 per piece. If you want to clean coins to earn money or even get close to breaking even, you're gonna have a bad time.

The case sounds awesome, but it may be useful if he can take the coins out of the case.    In terms of purchasing, I would stick solely to vcoins. Forvm is okay but much more expensive for relatively poorer quality coins in my opinion. Buying on eBay is a larger risk considering your relative inexperience (no offense) because there are many fakes. In fact, I would recommend not buying on eBay at all until you've become a serious collector.   If you are able to find coin shows in your region, you can find some wonderful deals.

I've put together an XML file which contains the coin info so I can take advantage of optional fields (e.g., a Civil War token has obverse and reverse die numbers that don't apply to coins like ancients), and then generate panes based on a template type which pulls appropriate fields and sets up the HTML appropriately so I don't need to type the boilerplate repeatedly.  Mongo would give you that kind of flexibility, too, if you choose to do it that way.  With my host provider, it was simpler to just generate things ahead of time and put static pages online, but doing it live would be cool."
AncientCoins,2u1rwd,pmstacker,1 point,Thu Jan 29 13:20:36 2015 UTC,"I only chose Mongo because as I thought about the schema I wanted, my existing Percona server would be incapable of handling it. Already have a few coins imported, and am playing with some tools for management of the data itself."

It showed me that only a small number of emperors struck the FEL TEMP fallen horseman type and this was the only obverse legend that fits. You should confirm it in hand.   These spreadsheets contain all the info from RIC (Roman Imperial Coins, the standard reference work) but free and in a much more user-friendly format.

AncientCoins,2tq9gn,iSmokeGauloises,3,Mon Jan 26 15:51:39 2015 UTC,"Feedback system on eBay is hit and miss. One thing you have to remember is that plenty of people buy fakes and have no idea they bought a fake and never leave bad feedback. Half the bad feedback you see on any ancient seller seems to be people complaining coin was smaller than they expected or something silly like that where they didn't read the description. I recommend spending some time studying forgeries before bidding on anything else cause eBay is teeming with fakes. There are a few books on the subject and plenty of websites dedicated to the subject and when you're buying a single coin one of the best things you can do is look at the known fakes for that coin on ForgeryNetwork or on Forvm's counterfeits gallery.   I'll try to take a look at your coin later on my computer when I'm home from work and see if I can spot anything. I'm currently on mobile and can't look as close as I'd like.  Edit: I should've mentioned that you could look into other auction sources. CNG, Vauctions, Agora are all good auction sources that guarantee authenticity and you can get some pretty good deals relative to what you might pay most dealers. I've just recently started looking into coin-specific auction sites myself but even after buyers premium and such I've seen some pretty good deals go buy in recent auctions and I'm still kicking myself for not bidding."
AncientCoins,2tq9gn,Red_Spork,3,Mon Jan 26 16:41:50 2015 UTC,"Though there is a lot of pitting, stylistically there's nothing wrong with the coin. The emperor on that coin, however, is not Maximinus Thrax but Maximinus Daia. The feedback system on ebay is very unreliable and can be dismissed almost out of hand.  There are a few ebay dealers I trust (for example ebay-branches of well-known auction houses). I don't usually buy on ebay outside of those, but things to look out for are the quality of the listings (someone praising a common LRB as an exquisite museum piece is suspicious to say the least) and of course FORVM Ancient Coins has a considerable database with fakes in it (many from ebay):  http://www.forumancientcoins.com/fakes/index.php  These are some of the more common fake (late) Roman bronzes:  http://www.wildwinds.com/coins/ric/fakes2009.htm  After collecting for a while, spotting obvious fakes will become far easier. Another good collecting advice I've picked up on FORVM is no doubt: if it's too good to be true, it probably is."
AncientCoins,2tq9gn,Nikodeimos,2,Mon Jan 26 16:48:56 2015 UTC,"The emperor on that coin, however, is not Maximinus Thrax but Maximinus Daia   Thank you! I was trying to attribute the coin fully and was unsuccessful, never assumed  I'm looking for the wrong emperor!  Now when I fully attributed the coin (Maximinus II AE Follis. 313 AD. IMP MAXIMINVS P F AVG, laureate cuirassed bust right / IOVI CONSERVATORI, Jupiter standing left, holding Victory on globe & leaning on scepter, eagle standing at feet left with wreath in its beak, A to right, SIS in ex.

AncientCoins,2tq9gn,Nikodeimos,1 point,Wed Feb 18 00:51:42 2015 UTC,"Heh, God knows I'll regret throwing this into a community of coin collectors, but here goes:  First one up is Lanz: http://www.ebay.com/usr/numismatiklanz?_trksid=p2047675.l2559 Next to a majority of 'untampered' ancients, Lanz also sells so-called black cabinet coins on Ebay, coins that have been tooled or smoothed. Of course, this is always stated in the item description.  This is another one I regularly buy from: http://www.ebay.com/usr/gitbudnaumann GN tends to auction its better pieces in Pecunem auctions, but sometimes gems pop up on ebay as well."
AncientCoins,2tq9gn,ghsgjgfngngf,2,Sat Feb 21 10:00:42 2015 UTC,"Ebay feedback and all other things, like power seller, 'top-rated plus'-status and whatnot are completely useless for this. This is not an exaggeration but the truth.  All that these things measure is how well a seller complies with Ebay's rules. People who buy fake coins will either give positive feedback or ask for their money back. Professional fake sellers will make sure they're happy and leave with the impression that this was an honest mistake that any seller could have made. Since they themselves didn't know enough to not buy a fake coin, they can easily believe it.  When someone does give negative feedback, sellers will do their best to have it removed. The only ways to avoid fakes on Ebay is by knowing what you're doing (which is tricky, since people buying bad fakes on Ebay also think they know what they're doing) or by buying from sellers you know are honest and competent. The latter is important, since there are plenty of sellers, at all levels, even in 'proper' auction houses, who are basically honest but know very little about ancient coins.   A good compromise is to buy on Ebay only from sellers that are well-known outside of Ebay as well. Most dealers selling on Vcoins can be trusted in the sense that their coins are genuine, even if some may have ridiculous prices.  I wrote something on this here:  http://www.reddit.com/r/AncientCoins/comments/2tbvmy/this_subreddit_is_awesome_and_youve_inspired_me/"
AncientCoins,2tq9gn,SolarDub,1 point,Tue Jan 27 13:49:12 2015 UTC,"A question I'd like to throw out there is that while things like pitting, dings, cracks, etc. along with patina can be added to a fake coin to make them look more authentic, have forgers also able to the dirt, verdigris, etc. that you typically see on uncleaned coins?  The reverse of OP's coin has some overlaying crud remaining. Would a forger be able to fake this to the extent that it seems like that crud is 1000+ years old?   While I see discoloration on fakes, I don't see the actual stuck muck from apparently being buried underground.  Just some thoughts…  Edit: One more thing, would a forger spend time and effort faking a common (say 2 standards between soldiers of a FEL TEMP) coin? Do they just home in on scare coins, or have 'common coin' fakes been observed?"
AncientCoins,2tq9gn,Nikodeimos,2,Tue Jan 27 16:46:09 2015 UTC,"Forgery can go very far. Though I'm not sure about dirt, I know some 'desert patina' coins actually just have sand glued onto them, so a similar process might be used to turn fakes into 'crisp' uncleaneds.  To answer your question about faking common coins, they are most definitely faked, see for example: http://www.wildwinds.com/coins/ric/fakes2009.htm"
AncientCoins,2tq9gn,SolarDub,1 point,Tue Jan 27 17:07:48 2015 UTC,"I know some 'desert patina' coins actually just have sand glued onto them   Ha, yeah I've seen mentions of this, so there is indeed that possibility.  I'll go through the wildwinds list again when I'm not about to leave for work. :-) But that Constantius II with soldiers and standards with the SMH(Gamma) is categorized R3-R4 by RIC. I'm thinking of ones considered having a 'common' rating. I'll cheek out the rest of the list later. Thanks!"

AncientCoins,2tmah9,Celebrimbors_Revenge,2,Mon Jan 26 15:21:18 2015 UTC,When I still used them I used wooden toothpicks. I have not tried plastic toothpicks but I don't know how well they would work. I really only used wooden toothpicks when working on dirt that was on top of a weak patina and that was because they are relatively soft and can sometimes cut away at dirt without damaging the patina underneath.

AncientCoins,2tla8c,Beastybeast,2,Sun Jan 25 16:58:51 2015 UTC,"These were part of a small lot of 4 unidentified Seleucid coins I recently picked up. I am fairly certain about my attributions, but of course let me know if you think I got one wrong as the Seleucid kings quite often continued the lines of coinage of their predecessors.  This first one is still a slight mystery to me. The style of the cornucopias is different than the majority of pictures I can find online, being more parallel & straight than the usual curved cornucopias one sees with this attribution. Please let me know if you have any ideas.   Alexander II, Zebina, 128-122 B.C. Æ20; Obverse: Radiate, diademed head of Alexander II right, one diadem end waving up behind neck, the other falling forward over shoulder, dotted border; Reverse: Two filleted cornucopias, splayed and intertwined; BAΣIΛEΩΣ on right, AΛEΞANΔPOY on left; Σ control mark on inner left and A control mark on inner right; Struck at Antioch on the Orontes mint   This second one could be either Demetrios I or Demetrios II. It looks closer to Demetrios I to me however, but I can't be completely certain. I was wrong, I actually think this is Antiochus IV based on what /u/BeastyBeast has pointed out.   Antiochus IV. 175-164 BC. Æ20 issue of Tyre; Obverse: Diademed head of Antiochus IV Epiphanes right.; Reverse: Stern of Galley with aphlaston, BAΣIΛEΩΣ ΑΝΤΙΟΧΟΥ & Seleucid era date above, TΥΡIΩN and uncertain Phoencian letters below; Tyre Mint; SNGIs 1083, Newell Tyre 38.   Third coin I'm fairly certain. Most everything I've found that matches what I see on this coin points to this exact ID.   Antiochus III, 223-187 BC, Æ19; Obverse: Head of Apollo right; Reverse: Elephant and rider right, tripod behind. anchor in rectangular punch and horse head in square punch; Antioch Mint, countermarked at Ekbatana; Houghton 76.   Sources differ on this last coin. Some attribute it to Antiochus I(280-261 BC), but I have found some footnotes that say recent research points towards Antiochus III, so I am officially cataloging as Antiochus III. Again, please let me know if you have any insight   Antiochus III, 223-187 BC, Æ19; Obverse: Nymph's head facing on Macedonian shield; Reverse: Elephant walking right, anchor above, monogram below elephant.

AncientCoins,2tjktp,Red_Spork,1 point,Sun Jan 25 18:58:10 2015 UTC,Please do.
AncientCoins,2tjktp,ghsgjgfngngf,1 point,Sun Jan 25 23:24:43 2015 UTC,"Uncleaned coins are good if you enjoy cleaning coins, which is something completely different from building a collection. The nicest coins you could ever hope to get out of an uncleaned lot can be bought in much nicer condition, often at the same or lower price (especially if you factor in the money you spent on duds)."
AncientCoins,2tjev0,qwaszx321,2,Sat Jan 24 19:30:13 2015 UTC,"What I like about uncleaned is this; you get to try and do everything yourself, it's a bit like solving a puzzle. In my first crusty romans batch, I found one of these, although badly worn, in addition to some seleucid issues, and late romans. It's fun. and it'll teach you a lot of the skills you'll need if you think attributing coins is fun - and I think it is.  Value for money, well, I would probably have spent less just buying the 'good' coins cleaned and in decent shape in the first place. But then I wouldn't have know I wanted them in the first place.  So.. for me it was a great start to the hobby. Now, I'm getting into other aspects of the hobby, refining my taste and so on, but if I hadn't started with a few batches of uncleaned, I suspect I wouldn't have kept it up.  Instrument wise, I use my eyes, toothpicks, distilled water, olive oil, and most importantly; patience. I'm sure I would get nicer coins with a microscope, but I haven't gone there yet."
AncientCoins,2tjev0,EvilCartyen,1 point,Sat Jan 24 21:16:52 2015 UTC,"Wow that's a really cool find! Yes, that's why I went for uncleaned instead of just buying some nice coins. I really enjoy research and I feel like cleaning these myself makes them more ""mine"" than just buying them.   Also, do you use the toothpick on the dirt that just doesn't seem to come off? When do you decide it's time to try that instead of just letting it sit?"
AncientCoins,2tjev0,Beastybeast,1 point,Sat Jan 24 21:23:39 2015 UTC,"You need mechanical cleaning to take away the dirt - soaks will loosen it but rarely remove much, if any.

But the portrait is still completely recognizable which is what mattered most to me."
AncientCoins,2te0nm,pmstacker,7,Fri Jan 23 09:29:33 2015 UTC,"With ancient coins there are a lot of coins which have only 2 or 3 known examples. Rarity is not the only determining factor of value. The other factors are:   Condition. Desirability. (Is it a theme of interest? From a specific city that everyone collects? A hard to find issuer?)   As an example, I have handled several very rare coins of Aelius Caesar. On average they have a value of a couple hundred dollars. I purchased a coin 13 years ago and for almost 10 years could not get an ID on it. Eventually it was determined to be a coin struck in the city of LYSTRA and was unique.  What makes this coin particularly valuable:   It is in ""decent"" condition. It is from an extremely rare city to get coins from. No other coins are known to exist from this city past Claudius, thus making this coin of particular historical importance. LYSTRA is a city mentioned in the bible so collectors of biblical coins would go through a bidding war to buy it because it is definitely a hole in their collection. (There are so few coins known from that city that you can probably count on one hand the number of them in private collections.)   Even with all of the above I would probably not have it certified. Why? Because it was such a special coin that the BNF museum in Paris had me send them the coin for them to study. It could not get a better ""certification"" than that.  Also, collectors that are buying ""slabbed"" coins are generally not traditional ancients collectors. They are not buying necessarily because of rarity. A very rare coin would be of more interest to the specialist collector than a guy that buys certified/encapsulated coins."

I'm thinking of getting things that can eventually be passed down through my family, but I also love the idea of being able to take coins out and hold the history. In this case, it's an extremely rare coin of my favorite emperor, so it's more a matter of having it verified for my own edification. Knowing that I can, in my own heart, believe fully that I own one of two known specimens. I think I'll possibly take up the suggestion of David Sear (or similar) if I do, indeed, get this coin.  Very cool on your own find from LYSTRA.  Thanks!"
AncientCoins,2te0nm,Whizb4ng,7,Fri Jan 23 16:26:58 2015 UTC,"Slabs are fairly controversial when it comes to ancient coin collecting because one of the benefits of ancient coins is that you can hold them without fear of dropping it and 'ruining' the coin. Personally, I don't prefer it. If I wanted to observe my coins behind clear plastic or glass I would go to a museum.  Third party authentication is nice though. However, this does not mean putting it in a slab.  David Sear, for example, offers authentication of coins without placing them in a slab and is one of the most well known experts.  Slabs come down to personal preference. Many collector who begin with modern coins prefer to have the authentication by NGC since they are familiar with the company and trust them."
AncientCoins,2te0nm,Red_Spork,3,Fri Jan 23 14:46:20 2015 UTC,"One thing to point out too: NGC Ancients does not authenticate ancients. They will give it a grade but they have a disclaimer that they are not responsible for determining if it is counterfeit. I don't know if anyone actually slabs and authenticates them, I think you only get authentication with sear and a few of the other big book authors."
AncientCoins,2te0nm,delafe,3,Fri Jan 23 14:49:46 2015 UTC,The big difference is that NGC Ancients is run by David Vagi and he is on the short list of world experts that I would trust without reservation concerning authentication.
AncientCoins,2te0nm,ghsgjgfngngf,1 point,Fri Jan 23 16:43:10 2015 UTC,"But the verification is not done by David Vagi but by different employees, some of which have been shown to be less competent than he is said to be."
AncientCoins,2te0nm,Whizb4ng,3,Fri Jan 23 23:07:29 2015 UTC,It is not that they do not authenticate. They do not guarantee authentication. They guarantee the grade only.  NGC will not slab a coin if they believe it to be counterfeit and as /u/delafe said David Vagi is one of the most well known experts in ancient coins.
AncientCoins,2te0nm,_eternalreturn_,0,Fri Jan 23 16:52:01 2015 UTC,"Most of mine are slabbed.  Beyond the authentication, I also prefer them that way because I consider myself both a collector and conservator.

AncientCoins,2te0nm,Whizb4ng,2,Fri Jan 23 20:06:19 2015 UTC,"Like I said it comes down to personal preference. Personally, I don't believe a coin must be in a slab to conserve it.

AncientCoins,2te0nm,Whizb4ng,1 point,Sat Jan 24 00:13:02 2015 UTC,I believe he means in the sense that the slab is not air tight and as such oxidation can still occur.

AncientCoins,2te0nm,ghsgjgfngngf,4,Sun Jan 25 22:46:02 2015 UTC,"That depends on the coin. Many rarities are just minor variants that don't increase the value. In some areas, like Provincial coins, there are so many rarities that are known from just a few examples or unpublished that it would be very hard to find someone to pay for that rarity.  Rare is not the same as 'sought after' and that can be a hard lesson to learn."

These ""barbarous"" imitations struck by Celtic tribes at the outskirts of Roman-controlled areas due to a local need for coinage (think 18th century Conder tokens!) offer a fascinating view into the artistic skills of these tribes' craftsmen.   A few official Roman issues to go along with them, showing the ""proper"" rendition of the design, would make for a pretty cool collection.  If you wanna pay more, there are bronze units and gold staters of the British tribes as well. The Catuvellauni and Atrebates tribes are just two of many examples."

AncientCoins,2tbvmy,delafe,3,Fri Jan 23 04:51:05 2015 UTC,"Vcoins is a good place for ancients. Do a bit of research beforehand though because each dealer sets their own prices so some coins are priced very well and some are priced just silly. Most fall in between that range and, of course, sometimes you just want to have a particular coin and price be damned.   If you have particular emperors or coins in mind, myself and many others here would be happy to help as far as if a price is fair or not."
AncientCoins,2tbvmy,calkinsc,1 point,Fri Jan 23 04:57:21 2015 UTC,"I second vcoins (two sellers I purchase from on a semi-regular basis locally also sell through vcoins), though if you have any coin shows or coin stores in your area, it never hurts to see coins in hand before buying them.  For example, I'm in St. Louis, and I know of one coin store in the area that has a good selection of ancients, plus there are a number of shows throughout the year that attract a number of sellers of ancients, ranging from part-time dealers through sellers like Pegasi Numismatics and Jonathan Kern."

The best recommendation I can make is that you find one or two dealers you can trust, buy a few good introductory books (Wayne Sayles wrote a series of books on collecting ancient coins, do a search for his name at Amazon) and join a local Ancient Coin club if you have one.   Best,  Alfred"
AncientCoins,2tbvmy,delafe,3,Fri Jan 23 06:01:08 2015 UTC,"I also strongly recommend picking up reference books, especially if you want to collect more than casually.  If you are specifically interested in Britain and the Roman conquest, Spink's Coins of England includes Celtic and Roman coins relevant to Britain - I don't have the current edition to comment on it, though, but you may be able to find an older copy as well less expensively.     David Sear also has a 5 volume set for Roman coins that is very handy - vol V is imminent, but I have the other four volumes.  His current series is an update of a single volume from 1988, IIRC - you may be able to find that inexpensively and that would give you an idea of what is out there to find.  There are also good resources on the web, with Wildwinds and Forvm Ancient Coins being two of them.  Wildwinds has lots of reference info and photos, and Forvm Ancient Coins has places to post discussion and identification questions.  I've also found the new eFollis courtesy of /u/Beastybeast to be extremely helpful as well for info."

Rev: SPQR OPTIMO PRINCIPI - Mars standing right, holding spear and leaning on shield.  Looking at the legend on the obverse you can get a slightly more precise date. The ""COS V"" tells us this was issued during his fifth consulship, which means sometime between 103 and 111 AD. I can't find anything more precise than that for dating this coin but that narrows it down a decent bit.  As far as the reverse, ""SPQR OPTIMO PRINCIPI"" is a pretty common inscription on coins of Trajan and ""SPQR"" itself very popular on Roman coins as a whole(and is still on sewer/drainage grates around the city of Rome). It stands for the latin ""Senatus Populusque Romanus Optimo Principi"", translated* ""The Senate and people of Rome, Best Emperor"" or something of that effect.  * I only took Spanish in high school and know very little about Latin"

AncientCoins,2t90pk,LionTurtleDeuxEx,2,Thu Jan 22 04:12:16 2015 UTC,When spelling out the meaning of the legend it helps to put the letters that do not appear on the coin in square brackets. For example IMP[ERATOR].  Personally I prefer 'Consul for the fifth time' since five terms for me implies for me that they were consecutive.   Is Tribuna a declension of tribunitia? I have always used tribunitia potestas but may have been incorrect. It has been a long time since I did Latin.  But that is just me being nitpicky!

Gently rubbing it with a tissue soaked in acetone or bathing it in acetone for a few minutes would tell. It could also be fine.

I personally don't like to mess with coins. I'll only soak in destiled water iff crusty so i'll probably just leave it.
AncientCoins,2t23m6,Beastybeast,1 point,Tue Jan 20 19:13:16 2015 UTC,"Acetone will not affect a genuine coin in any way but it will dissolve most artificial patinas. Late Romans don't sell very well on Ebay, so you might get anything from 5-15€ for it. More if you're lucky. But I think it takes away from the enjoyment to focus too much on 'value'."
AncientCoins,2stayn,michaelsilver,10,Sun Jan 18 07:28:19 2015 UTC,"You were asking for recommendations; I would start with some better known historic figures that won't break the bank; in Roman coins try Augustus, Vespasian, Marcus Aurelius, Constantine etc.  With Greek coins it's a bit different, since the majority of the time you're buying a coin that represents the city it was from, so, like Athens, or Thebes, or Syracuse, there are many to choose from, and they can get pricey.  With a little time and some research, you'll begin to find what area, era, what type of coins you like most. Most people start with Roman Imperial coins, and then go from there. Greek coins are more difficult to grasp, but eventually you get it.  I'm always happy to hear that someone wants to get into the hobby, since it is no doubt the greatest hobby. I'm an ancient coin collector and dealer with 26 years of experience in the field. There's nothing I enjoy more than to sell someone their first ancient coin.   I don't know what the policy is here, as I haven't offered anyone coins in the comments, but I read your post and figured, oh what the hell. If this is not okay then moderators please delete this, I will not be offended at all.  I was thinking, I could put together a group of about 6 or so nice ancient coins together for you that would cover ancient Greece, and Rome for under $50.  They would be attributed, and in good condition. I have a lot inexpensive ancients that I really would like to sell, and you will definitely get a very good deal. If you're interested, PM me, and I'll be happy to give you an idea of what I can put together for you."

I highly recommend checking out Aegean Numismatics on there for coins in your price range. If you look at the small Greek fractional coins I posted recently, both of those were $40 each and also I posted a denarius of septimius severus from him that was right around $30. Another highly recommended seller is Moneta Numismatic Services for your price range.   I know you said you're not too picky but do you have any specifics? Would you prefer silver or bronze? Greek, Roman, something else? Medieval ok? Any sort of designs you're more interested in than others(animals, portraits of rulers, ships, etc)? As it stands I have a hard time making suggestions just because what you're asking is so open ended I don't know where to begin."

AncientCoins,2st5gl,esnible,2,Sun Jan 18 16:24:17 2015 UTC,"You mean the two denominations seperately or an emperor that struck both? There are of course some exceedingly rare emperors and usurpers (Silbannacus was mentioned, but of course there's also Jotapian, Pacatian, Regalian and a whole slew of other pretenders) in the third century. Their coins are rarely offered on the market and achieve prices very much appropriate to their rarity. These emperors/usurpers usually struck antoniniani. For denarii, I think the toughest would be those of Caligula, Claudius, Pertinax and Didius Julianus (in good quality) and Gordian I & II."
AncientCoins,2st5gl,Nikodeimos,1 point,Sun Jan 18 08:59:42 2015 UTC,I collect both but I think I only want one denarius or antoninianus of every emperor for now. If an emperor produced both coins I would settle with just one of the above.

It all depends on what kind of dirt it is - you should be able to continue with your current method until you stop seeing progress. Then you might decide that some of the deeper details may need a little improvement with a sharp pointed tool, a steady hand, and a bit of patience. Are you cleaning to resell or for your own collection? If you think you may sell the coin at some point, I would clean it as little as possible.

Often the metal will be darker than the dirt, so leaving some between the higher points of the details will make everything stand out much better.  Overcleaning a coin usually refers to using harsh chemicals or scrubbing methods, like lemon juice or steel wool. This renders the coin ugly to most collectors I know. I would only buy one as a filler until I could afford a better specimen.  The concept of old patinas adding value is not just applicable to coins. Think classic cars, old wood furniture etc."

I still look for those myself. They may cost you a bit more, but you can see what you're in for.  If you're getting coins where you can't see anything, you may still be good to go, but you may also get coins where, once the residual covering dirt is off, you have no clue where to start. Nonetheless, start by distilled water soaks and scrubbing. I still get coins where I'm clueless whether anything's going to come up.  You may get coins that are clean under the dirt, but are worn so badly that you can't attribute them. This sucks.  You may then get coins that are just crap. Just dirty disks of metal.  Now, I can't say that some sellers deal with crap, as I don't want to point an accusatory finger, but some batches and some dealers are better than others.

Really interesting juxtaposition of a warrior with peace.  Quite a rare coin apparently. Did you see what NumisWiki says about it?   Banduri is of opinion that this rare silver coin is most correctly to be referred to the year A.D. 266, in which Gallienus, despairing of an opportunity to avenge the murder of his son Cornelius Saloninus, left off carrying on the war which up that period had, with mutual loss, been waged in Gaul between him and Postumus, in order that he might, with the universal strength of the empire, resist and repel the Scythian nations, who had for nearly fifteen years been ravaging both the European and the Asiatic provinces;  for such was then the condition of the Roman government, that it was unable to sustain against one sufficiently formidable enemy two wars at the same time. But this coin shews that Postumus chose to ascribe the accepted peace to his own valour, rather than to the calamities of the state.    Really, fantastic coins all over.

AncientCoins,2rziak,GeneralAgrippa,2,Sat Jan 10 20:34:08 2015 UTC,I'm quite a few hours away from there but the next time I find something closer I'm definitely going
AncientCoins,2rziak,SolarDub,3,Sat Jan 10 20:38:33 2015 UTC,Fantastic coins! Makes me want to pull my wallet out and add some more coins to my collection. Do you know the name of the dealer you bought these from? The tags look familiar.
AncientCoins,2rziak,lacedaimon,3,Sat Jan 10 20:25:33 2015 UTC,Out right now but when I get home I'll pm you
AncientCoins,2rziak,Doctor_Faustus,3,Sat Jan 10 20:36:16 2015 UTC,Great snags!! Are you on Ramen noodles now for the rest of the year?  I particularly like the Postumus antoninianus and the Lepidus Palius denarius.  Thank you for sharing!
AncientCoins,2ryuqa,americanseagulls,2,Sat Jan 10 15:27:28 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/a/laI1S  And here are two pictures I forgot.   The man I bought them from gave me most of the information and I researched to try and confirm it, but I wanted to see if you all thought they were real. Most things in Afghanistan are counterfeit and I didn't pay too much for them. I'd appreciate any help!  Edit: autocorrect putting words in my mouth"
AncientCoins,2ryuqa,Doctor_Faustus,2,Sat Jan 10 15:29:56 2015 UTC,I love Sasanian drachms.
AncientCoins,2ryuqa,Doctor_Faustus,2,Sat Jan 10 20:00:37 2015 UTC,So you think they're real? I love these old coins too and that would be amazing if it was legit.
AncientCoins,2ryuqa,EvilCartyen,2,Sat Jan 10 20:36:12 2015 UTC,"I am not an expert, but I don't see anything that makes me immediately suspicious. Let me dig up one of mine and we can compare them."
AncientCoins,2rxz3z,Red_Spork,3,Sat Jan 10 06:47:04 2015 UTC,"These are my latest pickups, just arrived today actually. I have had my eyes on these for a bit and since I had some money on a Vcoins gift card decided it was time. The first is:  Apollonia Pontika, Thrace. AR diobol(1.3g) 410/404-341/323 B.C. Obv: Full-face laureate Apollo with short hair. Rev: Magistrate's initals around the images. Upright anchor with thick flukes and a rectangular stock. The letter A on one side and the additional symbol of a crab viewed from above on the other side between flukes and the stock. Topalov 56.  I actually bought a copy of Topalov's excellent reference of coins of Apollonia, Pontika as part of my research and have my eye on a few more but I haven't decided exactly which ones I want yet. I'm in love with the design they were using around this period though, so it will likely be a larger one from around this time period.  Second coin is: Mysia, Kyzicus, AR hemiobol, (0.4g) 480-450 BC. Obv: Forepart of running boar left, tunny fish behind upward. Rev: Head of roaring lion left within incuse square. Sear 3850.  This one is about 7.2mm in diameter, which sounds small but seems even smaller in hand. I have no idea how one would've kept up with coins this small. I'm still amazed that 2500ish years ago they were able to cram such detail by hand into such a small die. This one was quite difficult to photograph but I hope you can see just how beautiful this tiny coin is."
AncientCoins,2rxz3z,born_lever_puller,1 point,Sat Jan 10 06:47:14 2015 UTC,"Great coins, those really ARE small!"
AncientCoins,2rxz3z,Beastybeast,2,Sat Jan 10 07:17:18 2015 UTC,"Great coins! I'm currently waiting for one of those Apollonia diobols in the mail. That's a cute crawfish on yours.  I also had one of those Kyzicus hemiobols once, but I gotta admit yours is a lot nicer. Really, just fantastic centering on both sides - extremely clear retrograde K. A choice specimen."
AncientCoins,2rxz3z,Beastybeast,2,Sat Jan 10 07:53:41 2015 UTC,The Apollonia diobol is my favorite of the two. They are both quite cool but it has the most eye appeal to me. Hope to see yours once it comes in.
AncientCoins,2rxz3z,Rocketmn33,1 point,Sat Jan 10 22:45:14 2015 UTC,I'll make sure to post it ;)
AncientCoins,2rxz3z,Nikodeimos,2,Sun Jan 11 00:33:14 2015 UTC,I had that same Apollonia in my saves list for awhile on vcoins....Awesome coin
AncientCoins,2rnyam,Nikodeimos,6,Wed Jan 7 20:36:07 2015 UTC,"What usually happens is that the specialization picks you, rather than you picking the specialization.  You start buying things that you think are under-priced.  What is happening is that you are becoming extra-attracted to some sub-field and are starting to recognize above-average specimens in that field better than other collectors and dealers.  Then you are hooked.  In my coin club there is a taboo against showing coins in holders with the price.  So we cover up the price.  Go through your collection and look for the coins that you originally thought were overpriced but you now realize have extra appeal justifying the cost.  That is your specialization area.  This includes the history and coin books too; so if you are watching a lot of 300 or Rome or Marco Polo you might find your specialization that way."
AncientCoins,2rnyam,esnible,2,Wed Jan 7 21:04:22 2015 UTC,"I think that the specialization picking someone definitely does ring true. Perhaps I've been looking at it a bit too rationally, and I should just let the coins speak to me and let them draw me in. Pretty much what I did when I first started collecting!"
AncientCoins,2rnyam,manpace,5,Wed Jan 7 21:18:42 2015 UTC,"I want any coin that tells a story, that gives dimension to ancient culture and events.  Everything else is just boring shapes on metal.  So I get stuff from all over."
AncientCoins,2rnyam,on1879,2,Thu Jan 8 00:12:17 2015 UTC,I study Severans so I went for that. I love how you can tell the story of the dynasty through coinage.  It adds another dimension to it.
AncientCoins,2rnyam,ghsgjgfngngf,1 point,Thu Jan 8 04:34:20 2015 UTC,"What Ed said, it's no use trying to choose a specialty. One may come or it may not. You may simply continue to collect all over the place but in better quality. I personally think that artificially limiting yourself to a certain field takes away much of the excitement of ancient coins. There are so many people that have been collecting Romans for years or even decades and have never owned a Greek coin, to name just one example."
AncientCoins,2rnyam,StickyReggae,1 point,Thu Jan 8 13:51:19 2015 UTC,"I used to collect everything that I fancied or thought was interesting.  Eventually it got to the point where I had several hundred coins but there wasn't any continuity in the collection.  I started to get drawn toward coins of Markianopolis and collected those for a while.  I have since moved on and am on a mission to get every REPARATIO REIPVB variety ever struck.  There are 138 coins in the series according to a record compilation, and I have 36 so far.  I guess specialization happens over time and can shift as well once it has been established."
