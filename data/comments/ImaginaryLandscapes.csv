ImaginaryLandscapes,3dpe4y,Phoque_It,10,Sat Jul 18 06:47:12 2015 UTC,"Just thought of this, can art generated by a computer have meaning? Weird to think about."
ImaginaryLandscapes,3dpe4y,Thefriendlyfaceplant,3,Sat Jul 18 08:56:11 2015 UTC,"There's two stages:   AI creating aesthetics. Procedural art like Dream Deep, something that could advance far into AI creating really lovely images, landscapes, portrait, environments, patterns and other graphics all based on these algorithms. Dream Deep looks nice but it wasn't meant to look nice. All the PC did was interpret shapes and redefine them into something it was familiar with. In other words, humans had nothing to do with it safe for the stuff that humans like to photograph (that's why you're seeing eyes, birds and dogs everywhere). AI creating actual art meant to provoke thought rather than be merely pleasing to the eye. This means that the AI can intentionally create images that aren't necessarily pretty, maybe even ugly or disturbing but definitely convey a certain idea or expression that it sought to create.     For that second stage you'd need an AI that's nearly sentient but there's nothing that rules that possibility out. Even if it doesn't fully understand the idea it sought to convey but instead 'stole' it from mining lots of data of what people found valuable, then that'd would still something that can be considered 'meaningful' art.    And once you allow for these types of AI's, then you can indeed ponder the possibility of computers superseding humans in their creations. AI that is able to create artwork that touches the human psyche in such a profound way that no human could ever conceive due to our biological limitations."
ImaginaryLandscapes,3dpe4y,grumbel,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:05:46 2015 UTC,"For that second stage you'd need an AI that's nearly sentient but there's nothing that rules that possibility out.   We could get there a lot sooner, as you don't really need the AI itself to be sentient, you could have an AI that you feed with Twitter and Google trends and that then creates art illustrating what is going on in the world."
ImaginaryLandscapes,3dpe4y,goug,3,Sat Jul 18 16:02:34 2015 UTC,You should read this very short story by Asimov:  Light Verse in full
ImaginaryLandscapes,3dpe4y,sealfoss,2,Sat Jul 18 13:56:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, but only with much more advanced AI that is closer to human intelligence.  For meaning to be generated, understanding of more complex concepts is necessary.  Technically you could say these paintings have some meaning, the very simplistic and basic meaning of ""BUILDINGS BUILDINGS BUILDINGS"".  EDIT: Though even then it's more simplistic than that, this doesn't have a concept of buildings as complex as ours.  It has a concept of the shapes and colours of buildings, the aesthetics, as with various types of animals.  But no concept of the function of a building or various other things we associate with the concept in our head."
ImaginaryLandscapes,3dpe4y,Potassium39,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:01:23 2015 UTC,"The only meaning art generated by deep dream is going to have is the meaning the operator gives it, not deep dream."

ImaginaryLandscapes,3dpe4y,Rozenrot,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:27:46 2015 UTC,It's still thinking about what is present and building it up trying to make it sensical.

But also that certain traditional media could get dominated by AI created art, such as images or music.  Whatever happens, It's gonna get weird, that's for sure. I'm excited about it.  And remember, even if a robot makes some art, we're the ones that decide if it's good or not. :)"

ImaginaryLandscapes,3czqd0,Konnektor,19,Sun Jul 12 12:09:39 2015 UTC,"Actually vision is extremely important in metro, your mask will get all manners of blood and dirt on it and you will have to wipe it of manually, sometimes during gunfights. Your mask will also get cracks when you get hit, and there is breathing problems on the surface so you have to change filters. And if you kill enemies by headshots their masks will become unusable if you have to or want to change masks.  Sure they could have done it a bit better but what they have done is already pretty sweet and very claustrophobic. Especially considering the ukrainian developers are very new to the scene."

In the game it should assume you aren't looking at the stuff on your visor unless there is a lot of it there. I know DoF is a thing in this game so it should have been used like that.

In my opinion, Red Hong's different angles on this idea give much more weight to the concept - his alternate views one & two.  You can see more on his ArtStation and website."

The artist says, ""This was done for Helsingin Sanomat, the most widely-distributed newspaper in Finland, to advertise their travel pages. The agency wanted a cinematic mood, Eiffel tower and Paris in it's natural state. The idea was that when people think of Paris they think of the Eiffel Tower and that’s it, but there’s a whole world to be discovered beyond that. I think they used some copy text in the final to explain the point clearly.""  I like seeing famous landmarks in jungles, forests, etc. It's been done before, of course, but every time I see these ideas, I get a palpable sense of time and future history. It's humbling."

The sword fighting felt a lot like Fable 1 meets Assassin's creed, Magic is sort of like dragon shouts from Skyrim, as you can only cast Signs, but they do various things as you level them up. The crossbow is kind of periphery and not meant to be a main weapon, but it can be effective once skills involved are levelled up. I played it to about level 36 and beat the game, did a bunch of side-quests and contracts, and it took about 55-60 hours. Watch a stream or youtube video of gameplay and see how you feel. It's sort of button-masher combat at lower difficulties, but there is a strategy to it if you have the patience to learn."

You can say the same about a makeup artist, they did not create the face of the person they're applying makeup to, so why call them artists?

The Great Derelict at Tanis was the location of a hidden shipyard facility, located at Tanis in the Great Wastelands. The structure of the shipyard was based on a piece of an ancient starship. Tanis Station, the name for the Hiigaran base there, was responsible for the construction of the new Hiigaran Mothership, 'The Pride of Hiigara'.   The Homeworld series is one of my favourite video games series of all time. It has a wonderful science fiction story, with heaps of tantalising mythology. The background skyboxes for each level in particular are an amazing addition to the atmosphere of the game; adding to an amazing feeling of the vastness of space (helped by the huge 3D map!).   So, here are all the skyboxes from all the levels in the game Homeworld 2. I hope you agree they are all pretty spectacular.  Now, for some absolutely fascinating technical insight into how these skyboxes were created all the way back in 2003, check out this interesting blog post: http://simonschreibt.de/gat/homeworld-2-backgrounds/  Turns out the skybox isn't a simple textured image file, but a vortex mesh! Ingenious.   Credit to the original Homeworld 2 Art Team: Rob Cunningham, David Cheong, Allan Dilks, Arthur Shimizu, Darwin Yuen, Mashi Akiyama, Nick Carota, Richard Marchand, Roland Longpre."

I then crudely Photoshop it into my digital landscape painting.  Though people here might be interested, any criticism is welcome!  Edit: Also if anyone cares enough here's a map of the island i was creating, although in my final piece this is probably more acurate as i suck at perspective"

ImaginaryLandscapes,3azrds,MuppetPillow,6,Thu Jun 25 07:22:32 2015 UTC,The high level of detail on the creature mixed with the simple background really pulls it out of place.  It doesn't look like this guy belongs in the world.  The creature design is pretty cool though.  I would suggest you continue working on this.  Work on your landscapes and try photo bashing to help the level of detail.  It takes practice but it can  also help as a guide with detailing as long as you use it sparingly.  Above all don't stop drawing!
ImaginaryLandscapes,3azrds,uncertaincoda,4,Thu Jun 25 03:17:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the criticism, i totally know what you mean, im still not very good at texturing so the background still gets that kind of unrealistic look which clashes with the creature.

It's incredibly well done, and it's obvious that the artist has technical skill, but the compositions on these things are usually some shade of terrible.  This would be a much stronger piece without the random aircraft in the foreground. It's so distracting and so unnecessary. It feels like a completely different ship language too, which I get that juxtaposition can be interesting, but there's no actual dialogue between the two different types of aircraft in this piece, and the angles of flight render this pretty static. Like, the closer one just happened to get in front of the camera.  I really, really dig this stuff. There are so many cool ideas and concepts, but it usually comes down to people trying to do too much in one piece. I just find myself wishing that concept artists would pay a lot more attention to framing and composition in addition to cool ideas and color & light studies."

Without it, you get this nice flow where your eyes hit the tower first because of the contrast, then are led up the tower and BAM, huge flying battleship like whoa.  Like I say, too much going on. If the focus should be the docking maneuver, then frame the shot accordingly and maybe don't also throw in those giant sky battleships. Or lessen their visual weight."

Any humans entering that place would be very discernible from the top of the valley you envision the character standing at.  Also, there are two smaller antechambers to the left and right for preparing for the dead. At best this chamber you are referencing would sleep maybe 25-30 soldiers, and would be best used in lieu of a generals tent, and would need to be well let on the interior.  The mausoleum you reference is very pretty to look at, and is basically only a facade.  Hope this helps."

I would argue that the art you showed is good, but i am also someone who can say ""this were graphics back then"" and can evaluate (or thinks he cans) the quality based on the tim,e they came out. What i mean is that the screenshot you showed me wasn't actually pixelart as we know it today but a try to mimick real visuals with what they had at the time, limitations and all.

Rotation. Relative motion. Matching. Matching perfectly, to make Allatiouray A and B two planets, locked permanently face-to-face in orbit around each other...  Using my suit's inertia controls I pivot in space and plant my feet on fused marble, below me. Then I stretch up and plant my palms against the rock ceiling above.

ImaginaryLandscapes,35rni7,avnti,1 point,Tue May 12 23:13:06 2015 UTC,"While I absolutely agree   Usually, they depict much less sophisticated architecture than this   I feel like the design of anything is heavily influenced by the constraints. Sometimes they inform the design, mold it. Sometimes, it's a counter to the constraints, a filling in of something missing.  I feel like castle design is based on the idea that ground forces will attack from the ground, with ranged weapons. But since the castle is in a cavern, the open court yard and small roofs might be better done a something approaching a pagoda style (big roofs with multiple layers) to defend from the superior position of the cavern entrance.  just my 2 cents"

This image takes me back to that wonderful time when it first came home to me that there's worlds hidden from our everyday view. Years before I could read or write, years before Science-fiction entered my consciousness, the idea of other realities was born by seeing, in my backyard, laying on the grass, stems of grass as mighty tall trees, pebbles as gigantic boulders. To me, this image captures that wonderful moment.  edit: a process pic."

It's an intriguing image because of the composition, lighting, etc., ... but I just don't understand it, conceptually-wise. But then again, that's the way with personal projects, though, isn't it? You never know the underlying ideas until the artist makes it plain :D  In this case, it appears the rock on the left is not simply a portion of a mountain but is instead a creature itself, a moving rock creature. The bouquets of flowers scattered about the desiccated skeletons seem to be of recent origin else they would've withered by now. And those flowers can be seen growing on the rock creature itself.  Who plucked those flowers, made bouquets of them and spread them about the skeletons? Was it the creature itself?  A very strange image. The more you think about it, the more it falls back upon itself. Even the artist's tags for this image shed no light on what's going on (birds, bones, canyon, cliff, conceptart, digital, environment, illustration, photoshop, prayerflags, rocks, skull).

Though, waterfall city was heavily inspired by Niagra Falls, so the illustrator of this might not have even realized the dinotopia similarity.  Also, if you like dinotopia, the guy who illustrated it actually has a fairly active youtube channel where he talks about how he drew dinotopia fairly often. Apparently he still illustrates dinosaurs for Scientific American & stuff.  edit:  Actually, I don't know if it's Niagara falls. He talks about it in this video and shows the waterfall that inspired him, but he doesn't mention the name of the falls. I think I just assumed it was Niagara cause that's the only famous waterfall I know of. I'm not sure what waterfalls those are, he says he went to visit them when he was in college, and Wikipedia says he went to college in Pasadena California, so, unless by 'visited' he means crossing the country they're probably not Niagara."

I think the artist is being a bit coy here, merely giving a friendly nod to a fan's idea.

From that perspective, the big figure is a husk of qualities that stuck to them over their life but wasn't really who they were, and the person we see left has unburdened themselves from all of those things in a return to self.  I think part of this comes from their poses, where the large figure appears settled in for the long haul, whereas the smaller inner figure appears more active and awestruck.  Sorry for rambling.  I really like this picture.  If it hasn't been posted there, you might want to send this over to /r/HeavyMind.  I think they'd like it."

ImaginaryLandscapes,33em6m,AlwaysFuckingSalty,6,Tue Apr 21 22:09:06 2015 UTC,More of his work: http://cryptcrawler.deviantart.com/gallery/
ImaginaryLandscapes,33em6m,TheBigBadPanda,5,Tue Apr 21 22:09:24 2015 UTC,"I like this one from him. Much of his other work looks a bit too ""digital"" and ""shiny"" for my taste, but this one is great!  EDIT: Also, i really feel like this should be in /r/imaginarymonsters rather than landscapes"
ImaginaryLandscapes,33em6m,Blackbeltzman,3,Wed Apr 22 13:01:35 2015 UTC,His art is mostly done for Magic: the gathering
ImaginaryLandscapes,33chw8,davekayaus,89,Tue Apr 21 12:21:59 2015 UTC,"This is the art from a Plains basic land from the collectible card game Magic: The Gathering. From the Return to Ravnica block, specifically."
ImaginaryLandscapes,33chw8,Liegeman,43,Tue Apr 21 13:58:49 2015 UTC,"Oh, good. I came in here to say 'no, that's Ravnica'."
ImaginaryLandscapes,33chw8,Vauxhaven,27,Tue Apr 21 14:42:33 2015 UTC,It's actually from Ravnica: City of Guilds --> MTG Gatherer Plains
ImaginaryLandscapes,33chw8,LitelySalted,13,Tue Apr 21 16:07:41 2015 UTC,Also from Return to Ravnica: --> MTG Gatherer Plains
ImaginaryLandscapes,33chw8,Liegeman,14,Tue Apr 21 16:40:21 2015 UTC,"I believe each of the basic lands had one reprinted art from the first Ravnica, in the Return."
ImaginaryLandscapes,33chw8,branewalker,6,Tue Apr 21 18:15:35 2015 UTC,Makes sense from a flavor perspective.
ImaginaryLandscapes,33chw8,Liegeman,6,Tue Apr 21 18:23:50 2015 UTC,"It was also in the original Ravnica block too, and reprinted due to its awesome artwork (that's how I like to think of it anyway)."
ImaginaryLandscapes,33chw8,notMyRealName420,2,Tue Apr 21 22:18:22 2015 UTC,"So awesome. In a game that I play partially just because of the awesome art on land, this is probably my favorite land art ever. And I don't even play white too much."
ImaginaryLandscapes,33chw8,NerahKero,1 point,Tue Apr 21 23:54:57 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one that hates the cityscapes of the Ravnica blocks? To me they look atrocious, but I have so many foily islands from the set."
ImaginaryLandscapes,33chw8,Mcsmack,2,Wed Apr 22 04:06:08 2015 UTC,"I always liked this one, tbh it was the Mountains of Ravnica that never really worked for me."
ImaginaryLandscapes,33chw8,JPMoneyHS,19,Wed Apr 22 08:01:28 2015 UTC,I think Ravnica counts as a fantasy cityscape.
ImaginaryLandscapes,33chw8,Kazzerscout,6,Tue Apr 21 15:37:31 2015 UTC,"I see it's already been commented a billion times, but yay Ravnica!  Started playing MTG during Dragon's Maze, even though it's only been a couple years, seeing this is nostalgic"
ImaginaryLandscapes,33chw8,robbify,8,Tue Apr 21 17:08:08 2015 UTC,Have you taken a look at the original Ravnica block? I feel like it captured the flavour of the plane much better than Return to Ravnica (although I do like that block too).
ImaginaryLandscapes,33chw8,whisperingsage,5,Tue Apr 21 22:18:28 2015 UTC,Imagine Assassin's Creed in this city...
ImaginaryLandscapes,33chw8,notMyRealName420,9,Tue Apr 21 18:13:55 2015 UTC,There is no tenth guild.
ImaginaryLandscapes,33chw8,zombizle1,5,Tue Apr 21 21:28:10 2015 UTC,"In answer to whoever decided to flair this with Incorrect Title, the correct title is simply 'Plains' which I felt was misleading outside the Magic: the Gathering context."
ImaginaryLandscapes,33chw8,kithkatul,3,Tue Apr 21 22:21:55 2015 UTC,"But even in the realm of mtg, it's still a fantasy cityscape. I don't know why it's tagged as incorrect."
ImaginaryLandscapes,33chw8,BreakFarst,8,Tue Apr 21 23:56:59 2015 UTC,looks like anor londo from dark souls
ImaginaryLandscapes,33chw8,scoopm16,3,Tue Apr 21 17:38:28 2015 UTC,Knew I couldn't be the only one.   Just missing giantdads.

ImaginaryLandscapes,33chw8,FoxBattalion79,2,Tue Apr 21 20:01:40 2015 UTC,You know it isn't.
ImaginaryLandscapes,33chw8,tonehammer,2,Tue Apr 21 22:10:39 2015 UTC,'Fraid not. :)  Here's his website
ImaginaryLandscapes,33chw8,GodsAreTired,2,Tue Apr 21 22:15:04 2015 UTC,Currently being completely blown away by this guy's work. Thanks for posting this.
ImaginaryLandscapes,33chw8,GreenLanternCorps,2,Wed Apr 22 00:02:31 2015 UTC,the lack of railing on those bridges is concerning.
ImaginaryLandscapes,33chw8,wymarc10,2,Wed Apr 22 00:01:07 2015 UTC,"I have never played mtg, but Ravnica literally means ""plain""  in Serbian. I guess making up new names is hard."
ImaginaryLandscapes,33e9f1,goateguy,2,Tue Apr 21 20:35:44 2015 UTC,"Simple, yet I already want to live there."
