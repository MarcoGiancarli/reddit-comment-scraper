madisonwi,3e3kjo,MadChris,27,Tue Jul 21 18:11:13 2015 UTC,Here is Madison's non emergency police number: (608) 255-2345. I'd give them a call.
madisonwi,3e3kjo,Kurtze,25,Tue Jul 21 18:19:57 2015 UTC,This is at the NE edge of the shoreline in the park. It's been there for weeks and I noticed that it has been getting lower and lower. It looks like it took on a bit of water in the last few days.  Is it legal to just anchor a boat at a random spot off a park's shore like this? Should we tell someone about it? Will they tow it away?
madisonwi,3e3kjo,_stonecoldsaidso,-160,Tue Jul 21 18:12:26 2015 UTC,Why do you even care?
madisonwi,3e3kjo,WiWiWiWiWiWi,56,Tue Jul 21 18:23:10 2015 UTC,I care about my parks! It seems like the right thing to do.

madisonwi,3e3kjo,TuckerGrover,-17,Tue Jul 21 20:10:22 2015 UTC,Ditto.
madisonwi,3e3kjo,IWantToBeAProducer,-23,Tue Jul 21 20:46:53 2015 UTC,Because I'm genuinely curious on what the motivation is.
madisonwi,3e3kjo,DasSchnootz,6,Tue Jul 21 22:04:17 2015 UTC,Being a good human. Caring for others. It's actually a beautiful thing.
madisonwi,3e3kjo,loblollyboy,28,Wed Jul 22 02:38:44 2015 UTC,"Well, for starters it could be dangerous. It could drift around and cause property damage, or it could become partially submerged and someone could crash into it.   Also, some people are just nice like that."

madisonwi,3e3kjo,takes_control,14,Wed Jul 22 03:13:21 2015 UTC,I emailed the Parks department who pointed me at the County Land and Water Resource Department. I'll update if they respond.
madisonwi,3e3kjo,Kesstrel,9,Tue Jul 21 21:06:24 2015 UTC,"This is probably the domain of the Dane County Sheriff, who patrols the lake. The boat is likely registered, and whoever owns it is probably looking at a fine."

madisonwi,3e3kjo,UWwolfman,7,Wed Jul 22 04:16:08 2015 UTC,Call Lake Safety. They can check it out if necessary and will know what to do otherwise.  http://www.ehs.wisc.edu/lakesafety.htm
madisonwi,3e3kjo,atypicalbnc,4,Tue Jul 21 19:29:56 2015 UTC,"Sometimes high winds can cause damage to mooring connections and the boat gets away. Sometimes it's on the boat owner for not tying up properly, sometimes on the mooring owner (usually the city) for faulty equipment.  The boat owner may not even realize their boat is gone.  It would be very nice of you to call the city and let them know."
madisonwi,3e3kjo,joshuateas,4,Tue Jul 21 19:10:07 2015 UTC,According to this link the county deals with mooring 150 feet or more from the shore and the city deals with closer items. https://www.countyofdane.com/lwrd/parks/boating_info.aspx  This link only list one place to moor boats with the city. https://www.cityofmadison.com/parks/boatmooring/  I still think the county will figure this out faster since they have boats in the water.
madisonwi,3e3kjo,TheRigorTortoise,4,Tue Jul 21 19:15:22 2015 UTC,"Whenever you see a sinking boat it is a 911 emergency unless you are 100% sure that nobody is on-board. If you are not sure call 911!   On the other hand, if you are sure that nobody was on-board, it's still an urgent situation. In Madison call the Dane county Sheriff's non emergency number.   Finally, if you see an abandoned boat that looks out of place (no lights are on, it's not attached to a buoy, there's no other boats around it, etc), then it probably escaped from its mooring pin. In the future please call the Sheriff. The longer the boat is in the water unsecured the greater the likelihood of  damage."
madisonwi,3e3kjo,peccavis,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:59:40 2015 UTC,"Not only damage to the boat, but damage to the lake. While it likely pales in comparison to the agricultural runoff, a sailboat in this condition is likely leaking oil, fuel, and other potentially hazardous chemicals into the water. The longer the boat sits in the water like this the more likely a spill is to occur."

madisonwi,3e1dff,dancinwillie,11,Tue Jul 21 11:40:48 2015 UTC,Don't some restaurants offer smaller portions during restaurant week? So if you get an entree off the menu this week it won't be quite as much food as during a regular week.
madisonwi,3e1dff,neonmagnolia,5,Tue Jul 21 13:48:00 2015 UTC,Exactly. We've actually just stopped going to Restaurant Week all together for this reason.

You missed two steals: Rare changed their menu to include a petite filet instead of just medallions, and they ran great wine specials (I ate there last night and was extremely impressed)   Tempest has entrees that aren't on the normal menu, which is really what I like to see for restaurant week. Plus the portions were normal sized, which I'm sort of doubting is the case at most places (I left there stuffed to the gills on Sunday)  Something tells me Nostrano and Papavero will be my best bets for the rest of the week  EDIT: Spelling"

madisonwi,3dze36,turketron,6,Mon Jul 20 21:45:20 2015 UTC,This right here. Credit cards have everything restored rather easily for the user. Cards attached to checking accounts have to go through a long process of getting your $ back.
madisonwi,3dze36,YeahILiftBro,-1,Tue Jul 21 01:27:02 2015 UTC,Cards attached to checking accounts have to go through a long process of getting your $ back.   Very true unless you do a lot of business with the bank then it can be time consuming to get your money back.

madisonwi,3dze36,KingsoftheNorth,4,Tue Jul 21 01:38:19 2015 UTC,Interesting to note that my bank told me they declined a $200 transaction from a Meijers in Kenosha.
madisonwi,3dze36,mjwinger1,13,Tue Jul 21 01:49:19 2015 UTC,"I think it is a nationwide issue this summer.  I've had fraudulent charges before, and now I track every single account online using Mint.com.  I check it DAILY.  I log on and check everything, check all the recent transactions and make sure everything is tiptop.  In the past 6 weeks almost all of my credit cards and debit cards have been re-issued to me as a ""chip and signature"" card. Unfortunately, I have not seen a single chip enabled card reader yet.  For example, Target has them, but they weren't turned on yet when I visited. Based on what I've read online the new cards probably won't really make much of a difference anyway for fraud (http://money.cnn.com/2015/03/25/technology/credit-card-chips-hackers/).  These changes seem to be temporarily making things worse as criminals are pushing hard to do as much as they can now before the new terminals are widely available."
madisonwi,3dze36,v-porphyria,5,Mon Jul 20 21:13:58 2015 UTC,"Based on what I've read online the new cards probably won't really make much of a difference anyway for fraud   The CNN article wildly overstates the disadvantages of chip and signature. The main problem with in-person fraud in the US has always been with cloned cards and not lost/stolen cards (which is what a PIN would protect against). A chip alone effectively makes cloning extremely difficult to impossible. Would a PIN be nice? Yes, but it's been deemed to not be worth the hassle for banks to implement for the ROI they'd get from doing so.  One real disadvantage though is that our cards were traditionally more difficult to use overseas, especially in unattended locations like ticket machines and gas pumps. However, this looks to not be a big issue any more and even if it still is, a few cards do have a PIN that's usable at such places (though a signature will still be obtained from you if possible).  Also keep in mind that chip and whatever was never meant to protect against fraud committed online. I wouldn't really call that a disadvantage, but instead an indication that chip works extremely well for in-person fraud."
madisonwi,3dze36,tmiw,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:23:13 2015 UTC,unattended locations like ticket machines and gas pumps.   Those are the only places overseas that I have ever had issues using a standard Swipe and Sign card. The main issue is that in non-touristy places the stores employees don't know you have to sign the receipt and get confused.    a few cards do have a PIN that's usable at such places (though a signature will still be obtained from you if possible).   If you have a true Chip and Pin card and enter the pin you will never be asked for a signature anywhere. The american cards with Chip and Pin just have the option to use either Chip and Pin or Chip and Signature and default to Chip and Signature. European cards default to Chip and Pin.
madisonwi,3dze36,The_Drizzle_Returns,2,Tue Jul 21 02:43:17 2015 UTC,If you have a true Chip and Pin card and enter the pin you will never be asked for a signature anywhere. The american cards with Chip and Pin just have the option to use either Chip and Pin or Chip and Signature and default to Chip and Signature. European cards default to Chip and Pin.   That's what I tried to explain above but I guess I didn't do it clearly enough.   The main issue is that in non-touristy places the stores employees don't know you have to sign the receipt and get confused.   The terminals are supposed to give the clerks instructions on what to do in that case though. I can see how they'd have to look twice though because it's not that common.

madisonwi,3dze36,Toofywoofy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:22:45 2015 UTC,We use them in our tiny local business. We got the chip-reader pretty much as soon as it came out--maybe because the company that does our credit card processing was harassing us about it. I'm surprised that other places haven't done the same.
madisonwi,3dze36,cryogenetik,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:50:07 2015 UTC,"Wal-Mart has had them active since last summer at least.  They have their readers set up so that if your card has a chip, you have to use it.  I have a company CC which is chip and pin, the rest are chip and sign."
madisonwi,3dze36,bdjohns1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:50:14 2015 UTC,"Just FYI that option of forcing chip usage is set by the financial issuing the card, not the merchant.  That said, I think most financials will force chip if possible since once all merchants are taking chip transactions it will cut down on the fraud possibilities."

madisonwi,3dze36,RandomPrecision1,4,Mon Jul 20 21:13:35 2015 UTC,"I think it's still highly worth double-checking and being sure.  Even if there is a specific local issue in Madison that does nothing to rule out the fact that malicious keylogging software and viruses can still be an issue that can affect people in Madison.  Edit:  Also, don't assume that keyloggers have to be physical USB devices.  It's simply software that relays a log of the keys you pressed.  A USB device just being one convenient way of getting the software onto your computer.  You're more likely to pick something like that up through a virus."
madisonwi,3dze36,ACLerok212,2,Mon Jul 20 21:30:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I think he went with the USB explanation since viruses don't target geographic areas. Unless it was on some local Madison page, which sounds like the least efficient way to commit fraud ever."

I believe they were told to get put some kind of metal or foil around your wallet or card to prevent people from being able to do this. Be smart with your cards!"
madisonwi,3dze36,DonkeyPuncherrr,-1,Tue Jul 21 22:51:41 2015 UTC,"This is why UW is going to chipped cards (and why the major card companies should have done this years ago). Virtually impossible to steal.  Also, a good time to remind people not to keep too much money in your checking account (the one tied to your debit card). Open a second account (savings or checking) and keep a majority of your money in there. They can't take what isn't there."
madisonwi,3dze36,madman86,2,Tue Jul 21 02:18:36 2015 UTC,"Chipped cards aren't much harder to steal, the tech just isn't as wide spread. It's an effort to slow down the thieves, wont stop them."

madisonwi,3dze36,_stonecoldsaidso,-5,Mon Jul 20 22:35:28 2015 UTC,"I am pretty confident, although not absolutely certain.

Second would be Colectivo (a Milwaukee chain, formerly Alterra) on the Capitol Square. Johnson St. Public House has great coffee, although it's not my favorite place to sit.  If you have one day to check out Madison, I'd say hit start on Willy St. And work your way west to Monroe St. while hitting the Capitol and State St. along the way."
madisonwi,3e0pjz,DoktorLoken,5,Tue Jul 21 04:09:37 2015 UTC,"Johnson Public House on East Johnson has arguably the best coffee curation and prep in town. If you're looking for a well done pour-over, this is your place. It has a very laid-back atmosphere and keeps a rotation of great rosters from across the country as well as their own side project, kin kin. There's also Salvatore's Tomato Pies next door if you get hungry. Other great places are:   Bradbury's my personal runner up to JPH. Has great coffee and crêpes.  Barriques (various locations) Madison micro chain that has wine and great lattes. Colectivo (one on the square and one on Monroe) Based in Milwaukee but has two Madison locations.  Pour overs available, good baked items. Mother Fool's Coffee is OK but the Willy Street atmosphere is what makes this place worth it.   Edit: added links"

As for restaurants, here's my shortlist of mandatory Madison eateries:   New Orleans Takeout Taqueria Guadalajara Erin's Snug Irish Pub The Weary Traveller   By Capitol Dome, you're referring to the observation deck, right? If so, good call! It's fantastic.   If you're into classic video games, Rossi's Pizza has one of the most fantastic vintage arcade around. They have games like Donkey Kong, Mario Bros., Punch-Out, Gauntlet, Tempest, Space Invaders, Asteroids (as it's an original unit, it's vector graphics, not raster graphics (aka images with pixels); you gotta play it to truly appreciate it) and more, including a number of pinball machines.

The lentil soup was great as well.  I saved room for dessert and had the baklava and I loved that as well.  Very flaky, kind of dry (but I like that) and not overly sweet.  You could really taste almonds and spices, not just sugar.  My only regret with the baklava is that on the last little bit I cut one piece shot out from under my fork, bounced off my chest and landed on the floor.  Wasted.  Good recommend, thanks."

For example, the Intermediate class is about building a small cabinet with a drawer and I believe doors, but they have classes about dovetails where you make a small box too.  The beginning class has you go through the process of building a small end table (11""x14""). The first class is using power tools - planer, jointer, tablesaw, miter saw, etc. Just enough to not cut your fingers off and to go over the plans for the table.  The second through sixth classes is drawing up the plans, buying the wood, planing and jointing it, making mortises and tennons, joining the top with biscuts, and finally sanding and gluing everything together. It's nothing fancy - just basic skills for people new to woodworking. The best part is talking to the instructor and getting tips on how to do things."

madisonwi,3dw0c5,risorius12,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:44:29 2015 UTC,Some good suggestions here already.  Sardine would be what I'd check first.  You might also check if you can do a graze menu in the private L'Etoile space (upper deck of the restaurant).  Saturday downtown might be tough with the Farmer's Market.

madisonwi,3dr2v6,_stonecoldsaidso,3,Mon Jul 20 12:11:35 2015 UTC,"If you're just looking for ballpark figures, I can give you a rough idea from when I rented a 2BR apartment with all-electric appliances.  Electric - MG&E - Around $50/mo.  More in the summer when running the AC (but up here, in my experience, you only end up using the AC maybe a couple weeks a year :-))  Internet - Charter - $50/mo for Internet only, no phone/TV (Netflix does all the TV I need.)  I think they had a 6 month or 1 year introductory promo for $30/mo, but then it jumped to $50ish.  Water and trash were included in monthly rent.  I'd also add - make sure that heat is included in your rent!  It seems like most reputable rentals in Madison include heat in the rent, but please make sure, otherwise your bills will be considerably higher!  If you end up looking at a place where heat is billed separately, at least make sure its not electric - that can ruin you financially, especially considering the awful winters we've had here the past couple years."

Nice, flat, usually in great condition this time of year.  There are a couple of spots where you can use the restroom or get water in Verona, but not much until you reach Mt. Horeb after that.  I don't know what it's like past there on the way to Blue Mounds, but I would be surprised if it doesn't ascend a bit.  Not too much since it's a railroad path, I would think.  Looks like about 200 feet of climb - pretty minor."

madisonwi,3do79e,Madcitygeek,9,Fri Jul 17 23:44:31 2015 UTC,"I just rode the entire length of the Military Ridge Trial a few weeks ago.     It's part of the State Trail system, so you need a trail pass.  They cost $20/year or $4/day.  You can get them at kiosks on the trail, or at some bike shops in town.  More information. The trail is packed gravel most of the way.  It's really flat, but there are a few low-grade hills.  Remember that it was built for trains. The trail goes through villages and unincorporated communities which usually have water and a place to rest if you need it. The trail is a bit crappier and less-travelled past Ridgeway, but nothing to shy away from.  The worst things are crumbling pavement sections and a few holes in the trail from animals.   Blue Mound State Park has a hike-in/bike-in campground just off the bike trail.  There's also a standard campground, which is fairly wooded so it's not like being in a KOA.  Blue Mound has lots of hiking and nice views. If you go a bit farther, you can camp at Governor Dodge.  I highly recommend the backpacker campsites.  They're really remote and quiet (except for the whipporwills making noise all night). Proof. Join us at /r/BikingMad  Let me know if you have more questions."

As someone else mentioned, a few ruts and bits of washout.  The segment from Riley to Mt. Horeb is all (gradual) uphill with not much of a break. Couple hundred feet of elevation gain over 3 or so miles. Nothing ridiculous, mind you, but after miles of flat railroad path, it is a ""hill.""  Water is sparse after you leave Verona -- my first trip I underestimated my water needs and was a bit thirsty when I finally hit Mt. Horeb.  Blue Mounds is just a bit on from Mt. Horeb.   The trail winds out to Dodgeville if you are adventurous -- but the quality of the trail deteriorates quickly after Mt. Horeb. It's as though they built it 30 years ago and then forgot the budget to maintain it. It might take more than 2-4 hours (depending on your speed and where you start) to get out there, but it has campgrounds that are nice (Governor Dodge State Park)."
madisonwi,3do79e,AdrienneBS,4,Sat Jul 18 00:42:37 2015 UTC,There's construction on Lincoln St in Verona right now that interrupts the military ridge trail. You'll have to plan a quick detour.
madisonwi,3do79e,hunjabunja,3,Fri Jul 17 23:17:29 2015 UTC,"The storm recently took down a ton of trees on the trail. I live in Mount Horeb and the trail (through town anyways) is in OK shape. Some ruts and washed away areas, but they've cleaned up most of the trees and it's definitely passable. I'm not sure about the more rural parts of it, but they tend to keep the trail in pretty good shape overall. I was at blue mounds park today to swim and just driving through I didn't notice any trees down or issues. I don't think you'll have a problem at all."
madisonwi,3do79e,TrekZeu,3,Fri Jul 17 23:35:30 2015 UTC,If you're cycling in you don't need to reserve a campsite ahead; they will find a place for you to camp even if they're booked up.

madisonwi,3dmti2,jaayyne,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:41:14 2015 UTC,"Yes I understand, but just wanted to show how cheap it can be. You don't have to spend a grand on a boat and have a garage to store it in. IMO rentals are a waste of money because after a few trips you could have bought your own boat for the money."
madisonwi,3dmti2,OOmama,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:46:19 2015 UTC,"I would only rent a kayak a couple times before buying my own. I don't have the money at the moment to buy one, though."
madisonwi,3dmti2,courtesyrasp,3,Mon Jul 20 17:48:01 2015 UTC,You can kayak on Monona & Mendota. Starkweather Creek & Yahara are nice to kayak on as well. No boating license required. Make sure to have a life vest on board & don't be put past dark unless properly lit.
madisonwi,3dmti2,oregondirtfarmer,2,Fri Jul 17 15:46:32 2015 UTC,"Lights aren't required on any vessel shorter than fifteen feet but it is a good idea. At the very least, I'll wear a head-lamp while canoeing after dark."

madisonwi,3dmti2,_stonecoldsaidso,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:57:05 2015 UTC,I actually am looking for a large creek or small river. I just moved here from PA for work and I left my kayak there because I wasn't sure how easily I'd find creeks to kayak in. Know any others besides these?
madisonwi,3dmti2,_stonecoldsaidso,2,Sat Jul 18 22:51:34 2015 UTC,The Yahara is great further to the south and right before it meets the Rock river. The Baraboo also has nice stretches. Further west you've got the Pecatonica for a beautiful stretch. The Lemonweir is another good one for forest paddling and exploring nooks and crannies in the riverway. If you want to go north the Flambeau and turtle dam flowage is amazing.
madisonwi,3dmti2,Wesker405,2,Mon Jul 20 17:22:04 2015 UTC,If you're interested I highly recommend the book Paddling Southern Wisconsin. Also: http://wisconsintrailguide.com/paddle/paddle-trails.html

madisonwi,3dmti2,LongUsername,2,Mon Jul 20 17:29:43 2015 UTC,"All the lakes, rivers, and ponds are open to Kayaks.  Legally, if you can float the Kayak and get to the water without trespassing, you're good to go.  No boat license required, wear a life jacket, and don't be stupid. Some bodies are more friendly due to lack of motor boat traffic than others.  Also on the lakes watch out for the wind: we've rescued canoers in our motor boat on Mendota who got out too far and couldn't paddle in against the wind.  As far as river trips, the Lower Wisconsin is a really nice paddle, and you can also paddle the Crawfish and Rock Rivers east of the city.  To the south you have the Sugar River which I've heard is nice, but never done it myself.  Plug for /r/paddlewisconsin"
madisonwi,3dmti2,_stonecoldsaidso,2,Fri Jul 17 16:51:50 2015 UTC,"This is super helpful, thank you. I'll be living on Main st. downtown, so I'll probably just walk down to Monona whenever I have the chance. Life vest is a good call too."
madisonwi,3dmti2,courtesyrasp,2,Fri Jul 17 18:46:32 2015 UTC,Life Jacket is legally required to be in the boat with you.
madisonwi,3dmti2,_stonecoldsaidso,2,Fri Jul 17 19:02:32 2015 UTC,"Also I think it must be within reach of the paddler, not just in the vessel."
madisonwi,3dmti2,BarkMingo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:35:38 2015 UTC,"The Sugar River is fantastic and is well tended and free of blockages south of Albany. If you do start north of Albany, be aware that there is a portage at the dam there."
madisonwi,3dmti2,_stonecoldsaidso,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:55:02 2015 UTC,Personally I think it's best to do the sugar river in a tube with a dozen other people. It's more of a floating party type river than a nice paddling river. Especially with the tube rental places and party flotilla's along it.

madisonwi,3dmti2,the_eh_team_27,2,Mon Jul 20 17:32:22 2015 UTC,"While not kayaking, you did ask about rowing which is different than paddling. If you are familiar with rowing or completely new to it the best option is Mendota Rowing Club which their Boathouse is located in James Madison park. Rowing is a excellent exercise and very enjoyable. It's much different than kayaking or canoeing but if it interests you, I recommend getting into their learn to row classes. Here's a link for ya: http://www.mendotarowingclub.com"
madisonwi,3dmti2,n609mike,2,Fri Jul 17 20:51:25 2015 UTC,"The Wisconsin River is a great place for paddling.  Better than the lakes in Madison IMO because it's a much better enviroment.  You also have the current of the river pushing you.   There's several canoe shops on the Wisconsin River that offer canoe rentals.  A shuttle ride back up the river is usually included in the price.  WRO in Sauk also offers tubing on a 2 mile stretch of the river.    Wisconsin River Outings  Located in Sauk City, about 25 minutes from the west side of Madison.  They offer 4 hour day trips as well as longer overnight trips.  They also have a location in Boscobel.   Wisconsin Canoe Company Located in Spring Green.  I've never used them but they have very strong reviews online and offer many of the same services that WRO does.  About 35-40 minutes from Madison."
madisonwi,3dmti2,_stonecoldsaidso,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:37:41 2015 UTC,While you are allowed to be on any lake kayaking and canoeing is best on Lake Wingra in my opinion. If you go on the bigger lakes weekdays are best and try to stay near the shore. There is a fun trip if you dont mind carrying your boat a few blocks or leaving it while you get a car. You start at West Shore Drive and Erin St on Monona Bay and then paddle under John Nolan Drive Turn right toward Olin Park then take Wingra Creek toward Vilas Park/Lake Wingra. Take the boats out near the B-cycle station near Wingra Creek Drive and South Mills St. You either carry the boat across St Marys and Park St or leave it and get the car.
madisonwi,3do0c9,Z0oma,8,Fri Jul 17 20:50:25 2015 UTC,"An excellent question. I tried to look up the answer to here: https://www.cityofmadison.com/dpced/bi/trash-recycling-bin-removal/44/   Along with a few other places that led from there.  I didn't see anything that prohibited it, however, it appears that the bins are owned by the city, which leads me to believe that you aren't allowed to personalize them with ""grafitti"" as they may see it.  But... That's just me inferring from what I read. Doesn't say you can't."
madisonwi,3do0c9,beve21,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:01:10 2015 UTC,"This is the correct answer. The city owns the bins. You're merely borrowing them (or renting them really).

If you will be in the downtown area, have a car, or easy bus access, I'd recommend a tour of the Capitol building. It is really lovely, and free!  From there, walk down State Street.

They have some museums there, you can see the terrace at the student union, and walk a trail out around the lakes.   If you can get farther out, there is a small zoo with a cute little beach, you can rent a kayak or paddle boat there I believe. Olbrich Gardens and the Arboretum are also nice to walk around in."

There's great places to eat and drink around the capitol square (and if you've got free time during the day, the State Capitol building is pretty awesome!), and state street has some fun bars and restaurants too. Willy street has it's own share of great restaurants and shops. If nature's your thing, take a walk out to Picnic point or through the UW Arboretum."

New Orleans take out is near campus and is a unique American food option.  Blackened chicken and a praline... www.eatmobettah.com  If you want a unique Wisconsin experience go to The Old Fashioned on the capital square on a Friday night.  Order the fish fry and drink a Brandy Old Fashioned Sweet or a Spotted cow.  If you're there on a Saturday not in Winter check out the farmer's market on the capital square.  If you're in town during American Football season see if the Wisconsin Badgers are playing at home.  If so go down to Regent St. before the game and find a bar to watch it in.    Where in Europe are you from?  I don't think there are too many places where country music is a thing.  Red Rock is a country bar downtown that has live music on Fridays.  Madison is pretty isolated from the rural feel, but this is your best bet to catch a glimpse of what we call ""white trash"" but it's also a ton of fun.  There's a mechanical bull you can ride!  Also, our Mexican food is awesome.  The first thing I do when I come back from over seas is get myself a taco at Habeneros but Taqueria Guadalajara is a closer option.  One last piece of advise from my travels...check out a restaurant that specializes in your native food.

There are about a couple dozen docking stations located throughout Madison which you can rent a bike from. Basically, you pay to rent and ride it around until you're finished. Once done, you drop it off at any docking station.  Looks like this http://www.longbeachize.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/201004-b-denver-bikes.jpg  Being from Europe, you might have seen something like this already.

Nice you mentioned the cheese curds ;) I have no idea what it is but it has cheese in it so it must be good (there's something going on with wisconsin and cheese right? I mean there are the cheese hats or something?)   What other foods should I also try? Anything special? (if there's a specific place for any of these please mention it so I will try the good kind :))   I'm really excited about the trip. I was skeptical at first that when I visit the US for the first time it should be NYC or LA or sth like that, but now I think that Madison might be even better. In a smaller town I think I'm gonna experience more of the real US and real people instead of tourists an whoever there is in these giant popular cities."

You might not make a life-long friend, but that's the best thing about traveling to new places.  A great ice-breaker?  ""Excuse me, I'm visiting, and can you recommend a good _______ for me?""

When will you have free time/how much will you have?  Do you drink, and/or drink beer?  What's your budget for fun stuff?

Ferrets generally have to be taken to vets who specialize in ""exotic animals"", and there are usually relatively few of these in any given municipality. You may happen across a vet who knows the ferret or knows someone missing one. Unfortunately, this is a sable ferret, which is about the most common coloring pattern."

madisonwi,3dle9v,HonnyWRX,2,Fri Jul 17 14:01:10 2015 UTC,"Charter is pretty much the only decent option in the area and you get a pretty standard speed for the price this day in age. Which should come out to $40-$50 a month for just internet if you have your own equipment. Unsure about first year rates but you shouldn't be paying much more than $50 at max for your internet. I've never cared for cable so can't help you there, but the internet is solid from my personal experience in the four locations I have lived in the area."

Instead of a concrete 5'x5' room with chainlink surrounded by a bunch of other idiot dogs barking 24-7, instead your dog gets to stay at someone's house, play with another dog or two, and gets tons of play time and snuggles.  Same price or cheaper than a kennel.   The sitters will usually send pics of your doggies adventures as well.  Super awesome."

madisonwi,3de5jh,RobotArmMonkeyBrain,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:36:44 2015 UTC,I think because most people think you can get a dui while biking. I drink (fairly responsibly) and bike often and probably 50 people have told I can. I stopped trying to correct them a long time ago.
madisonwi,3de5jh,daycaredude,13,Sat Jul 18 01:46:58 2015 UTC,"Huh. I would guess that the general public is indeed safer with a drunk cyclists rather than a drunk driver. But, they are still dangerous and obnoxious.  I live down the street from Capital Brewery. I often run by there around 9:30 pm, and I have seen a lot of close calls between cyclists and cars. It probably isn't a good idea to drink and operate any kind of vehicle."
madisonwi,3de5jh,DontAsktheInternet,23,Wed Jul 15 17:30:01 2015 UTC,Maybe Middleton should get some decent bike infrastructure and they wouldn't be on the road.
madisonwi,3de5jh,OpticalDelusion,6,Wed Jul 15 18:00:17 2015 UTC,"A biker doesn't have to run someone down or collide with a car to cause a fatal accident.  When a drunk blows through a red light or changes lanes without looking, whether they're in a car or on a bike, other drivers react, and that reaction is often the cause of an accident with another road user.  Same reason dumb ass bikers who run reds and swerve around are a hazard in general, drunk or sober."

madisonwi,3de5jh,DontAsktheInternet,14,Thu Jul 16 21:12:25 2015 UTC,"The Tavern League of Wisconsin is a key force in heading off laws that might present obstacles to bar traffic. Some credit the group with preventing the state from stiffening the penalties against first-time drunk drivers, a proposition that has been repeatedly shot down in the Legislature.   Drunk cyclists are a problem.  Yes, it's better to drunk bike than drunk drive.  However, the capacity for injuring others is much higher when driving.  Our state can't deal with drunk driving because of influence from The Tavern League.  Whether or not laws about drunk biking change, laws about drunk driving must."
madisonwi,3de5jh,_stonecoldsaidso,4,Wed Jul 15 17:37:51 2015 UTC,Our state can't deal with drunk driving because of influence from The Tavern League   I used to think this but its because everyone loves the taverns and drinking.

madisonwi,3de5jh,abrakadaver,-2,Thu Jul 16 04:46:34 2015 UTC,"It's not just a parking ticket. There are penalties and if someone is injured or it is a second, it is a crime with worse penalties. Parking tickets are $25, the first one of these is $5000-$20000, loss of a job, driving restrictions, etc. I just don't like when people simplify these things.

madisonwi,3de5jh,abrakadaver,0,Fri Jul 17 04:14:37 2015 UTC,"Maybe you should look up the actual Wisconsin laws, not some generic webpage.   First offense drunk driving is NOT a criminal offense in this state. Second offense, injuries, and children in the car change this. But first offense DUI is a speeding ticket with a bigger fine. It doesn't even go on your criminal record.  http://www.wisbar.org/newspublications/wisconsinlawyer/pages/article.aspx?Volume=83&Issue=6&ArticleID=2045   Wisconsin is the only state that treats first-offense OWI as a civil traffic violation. Although the legislature considered bringing Wisconsin into line with other states by criminalizing all first-offense OWIs, it eventually decided against doing so, for fiscal and political reasons."

We fucking did it America, we are the best at something! We don't need more excuses to imprison more of our citizens.  With three strike restrictions, felonies pile up and more and more citizens are imprisoned. This is idiotic thinking. If you want a solution to the real problem, focus on a different target."
madisonwi,3de5jh,Jipptomilly,10,Thu Jul 16 04:15:05 2015 UTC,"It's not a felony or a misdemeanor, those are both criminal classifications.  It's a civil violation because the penalty for a first offense is a forfeiture rather than a fine (see section 346.65(2)(am)(1))."
madisonwi,3de5jh,_stonecoldsaidso,-2,Thu Jul 16 04:57:56 2015 UTC,"My main point was that it isn't a parking ticket. There are costs and it is a criminal penalty if someone is injured by the driver or for a second conviction. Maybe education or cultural changes would be better, but I find that people thinking that it is a simple parking ticket and wanting to pull out pitchforks and torches and make everything a felony very frustrating. I'm going to stop commenting now since all that happens when I have an opinion here is downvotes..."
madisonwi,3de5jh,noisette915,5,Thu Jul 16 14:28:56 2015 UTC,"You're getting downvoted because you keep telling people that are factually correct that they're wrong. A civil infraction is defined as ""A non-criminal violation of a rule, ordinance, or regulation."" And if being wrong weren't enough, you're kind of being a tool doing it. You can't start cursing people out who are having a civil conversation and telling them that they're wrong when they're not - and then act like a martyr when you get downvotes."
madisonwi,3de5jh,buckynutz,6,Thu Jul 16 15:49:53 2015 UTC,"So it doesn't count as a crime?   I guess it depends on your definition of 'crime'. I would define crime as a criminal offense. A civil infraction is not a crime. I think most lawyers would agree, but I'll admit I'm not 100% on that.    It is still a misdemeanor   First offense drunk driving in Wisconsin is not a misdemeanor, it's a civil infraction."
madisonwi,3de5jh,vluhdz,9,Thu Jul 16 04:44:19 2015 UTC,"I wrote a big long rant but it really could be summed up this way: stop twisting yourself in knots trying to find a way to make it ok to operate a vehicle while intoxicated. A bicycle is a vehicle. Sure, it's not capable of causing the same level of destruction that a car with a drunk driver could, but it's just as, if not more so, easy to get yourself killed drunk biking in traffic. So I guess drunk biking presents at least a more just situation than drunk driving, where it always seems to be the guy you hit who gets killed. The only one likely to suffer the consequences of this stupid decision are the dumbass drunk splattered like a bug on someone's windshield.  Get a designated driver. Pick a bar in walking distance. Limit your consumption to 1 or 2 drinks (depending on what you drink). Or take a fucking cab. These things are known as being a responsible adult."

However, in the 18 months (ish) since, coverage has gotten quite noticeably better, both voice and data. You mention some of the places I frequent somewhat regularly, and while I can't remember specifically making calls in any of them, or using data, I also just haven't had the general experience of not having service where I expect it. I am all over the Near East Side these days, and I haven't had a dropped call in many months now.   your bars may read 3, but your calls are going to drop harder than Bassnectar at the Alliant Energy Center.   Have you considered it might be your phone? There would be no way for Ting to ""fake"" coverage bars -- so I think the coverage is there, but the hardware can't make do.

Better call retention than the Blackberry I had on the regular Sprint network. I drive all over Madison and the state. Am very happy with the call retention. I think it is the best I have had including Verizon.   Now, data is a different story. You can't roam off the network and get data so no Internet and specific Google map data. ( if the base map is loaded, the gps will still tell you where you are) or photos in texts. So off the main highway corridors or out of major cities is limited.

madisonwi,3dcq3g,JKibbs,31,Wed Jul 15 06:22:51 2015 UTC,"This makes me so happy!  The owner of Park Street Shoe Repair is George Fabian. He's owned the place since 1960. He took it over from his father who ran the shop in its original location right next door, the tiny shack was taken down quite a few years ago. Fabian's father immigrated from Sicily in 1912 and started working for Badger State Shoe Factory before starting his own business on Park Street which is believed to be more than 100 years old. The Fabian's lived in the Greenbush neighborhood along with many other Italian, Jewish, and African-American families until the ""urban renewal"" movement in the 60s, including my great grandparents and, grandfather. Don't know about the Greenbush? Look into it, it's fascinating. It's not just a bar and doughnut shop.   Anyway back to Fabian. He is the unofficial mayor of Park Street, when he isn't having a laugh with the old timers he is doing amazing work in his shop.   I am so lucky to have grown up nearby and be part of a Sicilian family with ties to the 'Bush, I have heard so many wonderful stories and collected almost to many delicious recipes in my 28 years."

When I commute, I end up riding behind the strip mall on a street, but I'd never encourage children to do that.  You have to pay attention because people back out in their cars without always seeing cyclists.  Hey, here's this great park and pool, we are going to build paths to it from one of the least pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly streets in Madison and do nothing much to ensure safe passage to these great new block-long paths."
madisonwi,3d9gd8,tasunder,8,Tue Jul 14 17:21:11 2015 UTC,Technically I believe that back street is a bike Boulevard though yes?
madisonwi,3d9gd8,tasunder,9,Tue Jul 14 17:33:04 2015 UTC,"Is it?  I don't remember seeing any signs indicating that, but it might be.  Certainly it is heavily used by cyclists.  These days, however, I actually just bike through shorewood to Harvard and take the path around to lakeshore.  Very minimal stopping that way and you don't have to deal with significant traffic on University Bay or Highland.  Highland at that bike path is extremely dangerous too.  The traffic lights for University ramps are too close to where the path comes out and it just leads to so much chaos and confusion.  I've had some dangerous close calls as a runner and cyclist there.  The more I think about it, the more poorly planned I think that path is."
madisonwi,3d9gd8,tasunder,3,Tue Jul 14 17:39:48 2015 UTC,"It's interesting, I just looked it up and that path ends at University Bay likely because that is where Shorewood Hills begins. Not trying to point fingers really but to me the discontinuation seems to be an issue with the Village. That and railroads are notoriously difficult to work with for putting anything nearby"
madisonwi,3d9gd8,_stonecoldsaidso,2,Tue Jul 14 18:16:16 2015 UTC,Interesting.  I'm trying to wrap my brain around this.  They just added a second path that goes behind the pool there in the past year.  What is Shorewood up to?  I've been to Harvard 15 times and still don't know.  Is there an MIT road in Shorewood?  Maybe I can find answers there.

I wouldn't say it is great, but it's been improving. The crossing at Highland used to be a fucking disaster waiting to happen, but much better now.   Crossing University at Ridge was not on my regular route - we live further West and crossed over on the Ashman bridge. Totally agree another ped/bike bridge near the pool would be a good thing."

madisonwi,3d9gd8,beatsforthemind,30,Wed Jul 15 13:47:41 2015 UTC,"Given what I know about driving around that area, especially at that time of day, I think the most likely possibility is that someone turning left onto Ridge from University was busy looking at oncoming traffic, saw a small opening, and absolutely floored it to try and beat traffic without looking for anyone in the crosswalk.  That road is a fucking shitshow at the best of times. People come off campus drive at fucking flank speed blasting through that first stop light at 50-60 mph, everyone is constantly angrily switching lanes, traffic is way too heavy in both directions for the number of people who make left turns from the west bound lanes so you get extremely fast and aggressive turns.  I know I go out of my way when I bike to go nowhere near University. I stay on the path on the north side or on the bike boulevard on the south side of that road. This is so sad."
madisonwi,3d9gd8,BarkMingo,5,Tue Jul 14 16:20:51 2015 UTC,"That exact turn you described in that intersection is quite a problem. They should either give cars turning left onto Ridge a protected turn or get rid of that turn altogether (right now it's either a blinking yellow arrow or a red arrow). If they are given a protected turn they won't have to race against oncoming traffic, potentially giving them more of an opportunity to look for pedestrians/bicyclists."

madisonwi,3d9gd8,whoooooooooooooosh,8,Wed Jul 15 01:42:26 2015 UTC,"...like enforcing speed limits. Speeding is a crime. Mostly low level (this is why it's a fine not jail time), but I don't think it's absurd to say that many deaths could be prevented by slowing down just a bit. Possibly even this one.  I know I won't convince you it's worthwhile, but saying they should be focusing on doing their jobs ignores that this is part of their job."
madisonwi,3d9gd8,criscokkat,6,Wed Jul 15 02:19:35 2015 UTC,"Of course it's their job, but I'd still rather have them spending their time doing things that will actually reduce crime. It's been proven speed traps don't solve reduction in accidents."
madisonwi,3d9gd8,JKibbs,2,Wed Jul 15 02:40:26 2015 UTC,"Speed traps don't. Speeding enforcement does by making daily drivers more aware of areas that they need to watch their speed.    Speed traps are intentional tricks with the signs on a particular stretch of highway that is designed to help produce tickets and increase revenue beyond what is needed to get the daily drivers attention (it is pretty much impossible to do this with infrequent drivers). A great example of this is the infamous Rosendale, WI trap. It goes from 55 to 30 with no intermediate 45 or 40 sign, and at the minimum distance between the reduce speed ahead sign and the actual speed limit sign (200 feet). Most towns that have a reduced speed on major highways will have an intermediate speed sign or will have a sign that is further out to give more warning. More importantly, Rosendale will ticket you for going as little as 2 miles over, and will hang out in sight of the 55 mph sign on the other side of town and nail you for accelerating 10 feet before the 55 sign.   The percentage of people pulled over in a speed enforcement action on a stretch of road like University won't come close to what is pulled over percentage wise in Rosendale. However the number of people who see those people pulled over will increase and will generally make daily drivers more wary and conscious of their speed in this area.   Unfortunately this area is too many lanes wide to install permanent signs telling people what their speed is and flashing at them to slow down. These types of signs have also been shown to slow down traffic."
madisonwi,3d9gd8,LongUsername,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:47:15 2015 UTC,"Went to high school in Rosendale and although it has its bad rap for being a speed trap it seems that almost everyone in the state is aware of it so getting pulled over is not as prevalent anymore.  To echo your statement, I agree that it helps people slow down when they start to notice a trend of speed traps in one area.  I live on Fish Hatch where it seems like they do a speed trap every week and I make sure not to go a mile over the limit on that stretch.  Yet, what I can only assume are infrequent drivers on that stretch still fly by me all the time."

My good friend was killed on E Wash (the 2-year anniversary is next Friday) and we had a ghost bike up there until someone complained that it was distracting so the city made us take it down, saying it was abandoned property.

It's easily the grossest lake in Madison, and closed most often due to ecoli and blue green algae.  I would literally never swim in that lake."

You typically see a graduate student who is supervised by a licensed psychiatrist or therapist.  They use a sliding scale for the fee.  The woman I saw there is probably no longer there but she helped me with my depression and anxiety more than any other mental health professional I've ever seen.  It's run by Edgewood College.  There's also Lutheran Social Services, which charges on a sliding scale if you're without insurance.  However, I would not recommend them.  The person I saw wasn't helpful, but most importantly they billed me over $700 months after I stopped treatment and actually sent it to collections without contacting me or billing me themselves.  Luckily I had all the receipts and financial documents I signed that outlined how much I should (and did) pay so I was able to challenge it but man that was a lot of unnecessary work."

I say since you have time before it snows, go visit the appropriate Budget bicycle center (they have like 6 different stores) and the Machinery Row and ask the guys for options and test rides. Only you will know what feels better for you."

If you can find one someone already added fenders to that's a bonus. Too small is safer to ride in winter. Please stay away from budget/machineryrow/motionless motors.

They have different names to make customers think they have a choice. A few of the employees are decent most are random students looking for a part time job.

Revolution is good folks. Another good option is Bike Right/Freewheel on S Park. The former is a regular bike shop with good prices on used bikes, the latter is a nonprofit where you can build your own bike from donated frames, and learn how to do your own maintenance.

After I got my bike back from Budget, the front derailer was bent and the cassette was rattling because they somehow managed to loosen it. The service at Budget was awful also, which I didn't really realize until I went elsewhere. They treated me the same way you'd expect to be treated at Wal-Mart.

I searched online to see if it could be fixed and someone said they had theirs fixed at a bike shop once. Apparently it requires a certain tool and the valves are similar to bike tires. I called a couple bike shops in town and they said they couldn't help, then I kind of gave up and went back to using my old ball.

I would check out UW Madison's website for intramural sports or athletics in general. I bet there is a large community of non competitive sports at the University.

madisonwi,3d7eh2,MadChris,0,Tue Jul 14 15:54:29 2015 UTC,"I would probably do that too, even before going online and potentially damaging a local business's reputation with scant proof."
madisonwi,3d7eh2,vatoniolo,4,Tue Jul 14 15:57:50 2015 UTC,It's not scant. I can verify at least 20 cases now just by looking at Facebook comments from CBI employees
madisonwi,3d7eh2,MadChris,3,Tue Jul 14 16:12:40 2015 UTC,"Well, that's pretty crazy.   I'm honestly surprised that that many employees are using their cards at work.  I wonder who their card processor is, because that's usually where the issue lies, and there's a good chance that processor serves many businesses. Either way, management and authorities should be involved ASAP."

madisonwi,3d7eh2,Nabooru_13,5,Tue Jul 14 17:58:57 2015 UTC,"I understand where you're coming from. I didn't provide much context in my post. The Come Back In does not sponsor us. We have not gone to another bar as a group during this time.   The six of us did get together to find a common denominator that connected all of our cards. It was the Come Back In. One or two people getting their card identities taken would be a coincidence, but all six of us? And if the Come Back is the only common point of sale between us?   I thought it was worth mentioning here to see if anyone had a similar experience. When you get your card stolen, it's hard to figure out where it was compromised because you're typically alone in the situation. It's tough to zero in on one location. In this case, with six people, and the Come Back In the only connecting thread among us, I think my suspicion is warranted."
madisonwi,3d7eh2,NerdyButSexy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:04:14 2015 UTC,"Suspicion is warranted, but an alternate hypothesis is that credit theft is very frequent right now. There have been a lot of card skimmers found in ATMs lately,  so it could be coincidence."

We have not recently gone to CBI, but it was soon after a night out to a couple bars. Purchases were for food and gas and totaled close to $400.   If it's locals stealing the number, why are the purchases from other states? Are people stealing numbers and then potentially selling them to other people?"

madisonwi,3d7eh2,new-money,10,Tue Jul 14 11:14:30 2015 UTC,There's been a couple of card skimmers found on ATMs around town in the last couple of months.

madisonwi,3d7eh2,IcedchickenKing,8,Tue Jul 14 22:00:02 2015 UTC,"I have been an administrator for a corporate purchasing card program. I was in the role for over 5 years. Fraud is a huge issue that the card providers are always trying to stay one step ahead on.   Every year we had to go through training on what to look for, what the new fraud methods were and what they started doing to combat the new fraud methods.   It's natural to try an pinpoint a place in our lives where we feel our card might have been compromised. But in reality, they never have to see your card. They have card number generators via software and sometimes they can transfer the active number to a physical card. They test it out with small transactions to make sure it's a good number and when they do - then they go to town. This kind of fraud is especially likely if your card is used in another state or country all of a sudden.   So while its possible that it got compromised at a local venue, it's not probable. So I caution you on calling out a specific business like this."
madisonwi,3d7eh2,Neeperando,2,Tue Jul 14 11:26:40 2015 UTC,I'm here to call out the CBI specifically. I have a number of friends and acquaintances that work or frequent there that have all had their info stolen. Figure in these 6 and it's way too big of a coincidence. Probably an employee selling the info given how much turnover that place has
madisonwi,3d7eh2,DonkeyPuncherrr,3,Tue Jul 14 15:57:13 2015 UTC,My card was compromised about a month ago but Chase caught it right away and notified me.  I was at the Come Back Inn earlier this summer but I don't remember if I paid with that card.
madisonwi,3d7eh2,DonkeyPuncherrr,2,Tue Jul 14 12:55:48 2015 UTC,"Same. My card had been used in California about a month ago. Chase contacted me right away. This was my first time ever having a card compromised. I have been to Comeback In a couple times this summer, but of course that doesn't mean it was stolen there.  Any time you use your card you are at risk. When I worked in retail we had a couple employees who were writing down card numbers when they were on registers, then bought stuff from our store. Of course they were idiots and got busted, but if they had been smarter about it they could have saved the numbers for 6 months and then purchased something from a different store."
madisonwi,3d7eh2,vatoniolo,3,Tue Jul 14 16:19:52 2015 UTC,I used mine at the essen haus in December and my bank informed me that it was stolen in January.
madisonwi,3d7eh2,MadChris,3,Tue Jul 14 13:59:28 2015 UTC,I have an office league that plays there and two of our people reported finding fraudulent stuff twice so far this summer. I think the one guys friends (3 of them) who all play another league there have had issues with stolen cards as well.   Defiantly worth reporting to mpd. We encouraged my friend to and the police report helped with the credit card company and hopefully it gets things rolling to help stop it.   Everyone please file reports and don't sit passively by like my friends were 2 weeks ago before we pressured them to report it all.

He made his fortune off Vitamin Water and he's trying to do it again with a number of other businesses, including this Vodka brand. He's an entrepreneur promoting his own product. If you read the article, it says he has been doing similar grocery store appearances around the country all year. I doubt this appearance has anything to do with his bankruptcy or the recent court judgment."

Dude is still an international icon and still makes music. He could do a single commercial or a feature and get paid more than you've made in your lifetime.  Don't think he's the loser.
madisonwi,3d6555,Ouijynn,-3,Mon Jul 13 22:11:33 2015 UTC,"I found another article about him showing up at a different grocery store. They sold $54,000 worth of vodka. Sorry if a multimillionaire shows up to sell that small of an amount of vodka he looks like a loser to me. Do you think he is doing this because he can't wait to see woodmans, because he loves his fans? These are not his companies either. He just but a few percent of them and claims they are his. This is the same as every crappy celebrity restaurant. Do you think Jimmy buffet hangs out at every margaritaville. No because he isn't stupid."
madisonwi,3d6555,uraniumroxx,2,Mon Jul 13 22:21:51 2015 UTC,"I had never heard of EFFEN Vodka before. As a result of his appearance, now I have. If his appearance wasn't during business hours, I might have even shown up and bought a bottle to try.  It's not about sales at each appearance, it's about building a brand. Sorry if a multimillionaire with multiple established brands doesn't meet your standards of brand development.  Of course he doesn't care about Woodmans and maybe he doesn't even care about his fans. But you know what he does care about? Building a vodka business. And this is part of his strategy for doing it the best he can. And it makes perfect sense to me, considering the only other vodka retailer in town that even comes close to Woodmans sales is CostCo, who sells their own vodka and would require a nationwide deal to be able to promote there.  And yes, they are his companies. They are not only his, but he owns part of them (more than a few percent, despite your baseless assumptions). He stands to gain from the company's growth. That's why he contributes by promoting the products.  Very elementary concepts here."

madisonwi,3d5bz4,CapitolAutoCredit,7,Mon Jul 13 17:23:37 2015 UTC,"I heard it was a promotion or something and then got left there. Forever.    Edit: Found this:   The Elephant in DeForest, aka ""Pinkie"", stands at a Citgo station. In the late 1970s, this was an ARCO station - one of several ARCO stations in the area with pink elephant statues. This is the last one left. These photos are from 2011. In 2014, the statue was repainted.    2nd Edit: From a photo of the info plate in front of Pinkie   The Pink Elephant has been at this gast station since the mid-late 1960's. The elephant was brought here because the owner was looking for a way to make his gas station stand out from the other gas stations on this intersection. The elephant has been here ever since.  It certainly is a road-side attraction and landmark in the area!  This Pink Elephant along with others were produced by Sculptered Advertising in Sparta, WI. Pinky was the first produced Pink Elephant and installed in 1963 in front of the Pink Elephant Supper Club in Marquette, IA. The Marquette elephant never had the cool sunglasses though. Other pink elephants were produced for Arco Gas Stations in the area that all displayed Pink Elephants. Our famous Pink Elephant is the last one left in this area. A few other elephants can be found at car washes, antique malls and car dealerships in Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and Tennessee.  Many people would stop here to take photos with the elephant and continue to do so today. Some tourists even tell us they have pictures of their children with the elephant from years ago and are now stopping to show their grandchildren.  The Pink Elephant has had several owners over the years and has endured too much graffiti but with each change of hands the Pink Elephant has been loved and cherished. This gas station is known for the Pink Elephant, has lots of Pink Elephant merchandise and works hard to keep him clean. These isn't one name associated with our Pink Elephant; most refer to him as ""Pinkie."" Pinkie loves to see visitors and is still so photogenic!"

But it's disappointing to see nearly every single article, even those with as scarce information as this one (it didn't even say whether he was actually wearing helmet or not), feels it necessary to place some blame on the victim before knowing all the facts."

They have bottomless mimosas.   Shoe repair stores? Any recommendations? I need a resole of some loafers.   Cecil's on Odana. Old guy who's been doing it forever. His prices are probably the best around. He will fix pretty much anything for you, not just shoes. If it's a quick fix he will commonly say no charge (although it's nice to pay anyways).   I miss Mexican food. Tell me your places.   I really like Los Gemelos for good cheap Mexican food at bar time."

madisonwi,3d6ago,postrnut,2,Wed Jul 15 17:49:28 2015 UTC,"Mexican: Most folks favorite is Taqueria Guadalajara on Park Street. I am a big fan, and can't go wrong there. Also can find good food at Los Gemelos West Side, which I think is slightly better than their State St. location. Get more authentic dishes at the West Side location. Also found Taqueria Hispana/Queratano(?) out across from East Town Mall damned tasty with big tacos for the price."
madisonwi,3d6ago,elephantbusstop,3,Mon Jul 13 22:13:42 2015 UTC,Taqueria Sabor Queretano is legit! I'm surprised more people haven't heard of this place. It is kind of hidden in a strip mall behind Mcdonalds.

madisonwi,3d6ago,VibrantGoo,4,Mon Jul 13 22:47:25 2015 UTC,Agree with 7. Michelangelo's has terrible coffee. Johnson Public House is totally the way to go!
madisonwi,3d6ago,mrrreow,2,Mon Jul 13 23:05:34 2015 UTC,"Brunch: Madison Sourdough Co. has some lovely brunch offerings. The bread is great and the space is very pleasant. There's a little dessert section next door. Crowded on weekends.  Mexican: If you just want good food and don't need a proper restaurant, visit Mercado Marimar. You order at a counter, there's the usual tacos, they make the tortillas fresh on Saturday. Carnitas available on weekends, daily specials (e.g. pozole, chulettas, mixiotes etc), tamales, quesadillas etc. Authentic, tasty, cheap. Small sit-down area available.  Taliesin tours: Worth it, I think. You can't get in without the tour anyway. I wouldn't do the longest tour unless you're a real big fan - there's plenty to see on the shorter ones.  Shoe repair: Haven't been to that many shops, but Cecil at Cecil's West is very nice and takes his work seriously.  Coffee: I'm not a fan of Michelangelo's. If you're talking about just the coffee, best places are probably Johnson's Public House and Bradbury's. I'd give the edge to Bradbury's (they don't have as posh a bean selection, but they brew the coffee well), which also has super delicious crepes. Small place that can get pretty crowded on Saturday because it's near the market.   Auto: I like Dutch's Auto. They're friendly and honest. No nasty surprises, and they are very willing to talk to you about your car and the work."

Good beer too. Or Umami on Willy street LaFayette and Green Counties are so so nice! There's a place on Regent, but I've never used it. Madison Munchies will deliver basically anything you can get at a grocery store including candy and ice cream - stoner City! I really like Falbo's pizza. Orient House on Park street is good 6/10 unhealthy Chinese food :) I'm not sure about that. 7.Yes! I like that place. I also like Indie Coffee on Regent.  Has good reputation as LGBT-friendly dive bar...I guess the whole of the east side does! The Rustic Tavern on Park is a good dive bar too.  I just go to Midas. They have plenty of free services, like check-ups and stuff, and I have never felt pressured. Not sure. A friend is a chef at the Stam House and apparently the menu is pretty serious and daring. Prob not too cheap I would imagine. Again, the aforementioned counties. Lots of lush countryside and farmland. Good hiking if you get off the beaten track. Taqueria Guadalajara on Park street (are you sensing I live around there??) Don't do yoga. Too much food. The UP of Michigan is my favorite place in the world behind Washington Island, WI. Really the reason I decided to answer your questions was just to give a shout out to the UP. PM me for a well-kept secret I would rather not share publicly. Madeline Island is wonderful - I love the Bayfield region in general. Kinda touristy up there in the summer, but not as bad as Door County because of it's location. Can't beat that lake breeze, especially on a day like today! Wish I was there!"

I can't say they're worth the money compared to other entertainment, but if you're willing to travel to AZ I'd say go for it Basset = meh. Sardine is awesome, Shamrock is awesome, I hear good things about Old Fashioned, and you can't go wrong with either Mickey's (Dairy Bar by the Camp Randall or Tavern on Willy St.) Only bottomless mimoasa I know of are at DLUX. If you love cheap mimosas that much, the food is good enough Go to Roxbury, WI on the way to Devil's lake. The Roxbury tavern is a great little restaurant, and basically the only place in town. Mt. Horeb has a cute Troll thing going for it, and a great brewery as well. The Dells are pretty fucking picturesque if you can see past the tourist crap Heel and Sole on Sherman Ave is the only one I've seen that wasn't closed Banzo, by far if you like Mediterranean. Both Taj indian and Maharani are pretty good for Indian Strictly discs has a great selection, and MadCity and Sugar Shack are cool, but the one you're thinking of is Resale Records on Commercial Ave. It's an old metal building and a bunch of old dudes just smoke, drink beer, and listen to records. Also the best place to get a deal. Just talk to the guy, he knows his stuff Coffee shops are hotly debated. I don't go to Michaelangelos so I wouldn't know Caribou Tavern... not LGBT per se, but a dive with a very unique crowd. Awesome burgers. Laundromat is next door, so lots of people drop in for a drink while waiting I go to the carx on east wash mostly out of convenience (I can walk home from it) Craftsman Table & Tap in Middleton, never been. Stamm House 1847, also never been but nothing but good reviews from my friends I like the baraboo area and up towards the Dells. I get lost on hwy U on purpose when going to visit the crane foundation or ho chunk casino Taqueria Gudalajara on Park is #1. The new El Sabor de Puebla on Willy St is pretty good as well Too many to list, don't have one anyhow 2 travel questions: The UP is both amazing and weird. Get some pasties. Bring a bunch of cans and bottles and finance your trip with the deposits (I did this in high school, probably not the best idea for an adult) I would rather go to Door county, though. Never been to Madeline island or the Apostles, but certainly not awful, I only hear good things. I hear REALLY good things about Isle Royale as well"

madisonwi,3d6ago,beloitpiper,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:56:30 2015 UTC,"If you're a big fan of FLW, yes the tour is worth it.  A few years ago I mapped out a FLW tour of Madison you can do on a bike. Sophia's on Johnson is great.  It only has 4 tables, and only open on the weekend, but really really great breakfast/brunch.  Get take out and eat my the lake. Mineral Point!  19th century granite buildings host art galleries, a brew pub, Japanese restaurant, potters, and a living history outdoor museum. I use Cecil's on Odana. Glass Nickle is the best American-style delivery pizza. It's not an LGBT bar, but certainly LGBT-friendly.  Great burgers, solid dive bar. Craftsman Table and Tap is good.  Check out The Free House - not amazing, but a solid local spot for good beer.  Haven't been to Stamm House yet (it just reopened). Scenic drives: Hwy 14 along the Wisconsin River and Hwy 69 to New Glarus/Monroe are nearby.  If you want to make a day/weekend of it, Drive to Prairie Du Chien and go up the Great River Road to La Crosse then drive home through the Driftless Region.  Hands down the most beautiful drive in the Midwest.  Specifically, I was go from La Crosse to Bangor, down 162 to Coon Valley, then 61 into Westby, up 27/33 to Ontario, 33 to Hillsboro, then 80 to Richland Center and 14 back home.  Bonus points if you do this the second week of October with all the color. Taqueria Guadalajara The UP is amazing.  Go there.  Medeline Island is also amazing.  Also go to the Apostle Islands.  Door County is also worth mentioning, but is not rustic and wild like the northwoods are.  It's basically the Cape Cod of the Midwest."
madisonwi,3d6ago,name_with_a_y,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:03:41 2015 UTC,"Welcome to Madison!  1. Taliesin East Tours - are they worth it? I'm a FLW fan (the Lamp house downtown was a surprise), and would love to see this compound, and eventually the one in Scottsdale. Worth it? There's a home tour and an estate tour, the estate tour runs $85.  I don't know about that one but here is a map of a FLR bicycle tour you can take. Good if you'd just like to see the houses from the outside. If you don't have a bike, maybe rent a B-cycle? Not sure how much it would cost.  2. What are some of your favorite brunches in the city? I've been to Marigold Kitchen which was really amazing (I met Greta Gerwig there, which was awesome) and Bassett Street brunch club. I've heard El Dorado is good too. Any drink specials? I like bottomless mimosas (as we all should).  It seems weird to eat brunch in a grocery store, but the west side Hy-Vee has an awesome Sunday brunch. All you can eat for less than 15 dollars. It's got prime rib, made to order omelets, the whole shebang. And they have a bar.  3. What are some cute/picturesque towns nearby? I'm thinking 1-3 hours away. I know New Glarus is a cute Swiss-style town, but that's it.  I like Stoughton. Go eat breakfast at The Koffee Kup and browse some antique shops. And be sure to stop into the historical society. The lady who works there is lovely and they have a lot of neat stuff.  11. Your favorite scenic drives? I've really been enjoying the north side of Lake Mendota, the rolling fields and big skies. So so pretty. What else?  The drive out to Devil's Lake is nice. And if you plan your route right, you can see the Forevertron. It's a massive scrap metal sculpture. It's behind Delaney's Surplus in North Freedom."

madisonwi,3d6ago,Visceralrealism,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:32:07 2015 UTC,"No idea, but that whole area has lots of cool stuff to do--Governor Dodge State Park is right down the road, a huge 'bowl' valley in the middle of cornfields. Waterfalls, hiking, camping, canoeing, fishing. Also, American Players Theatre is very close.  Strictly on the basis of food, I really like Dobhan (not a mimosa person, but the bloody Maria is great), but the east side see-and-be-seen brunch is Mickey's Tavern, which also has very good food and bloodies.  Mount Horeb, Mineral Point, Spring Green. No idea. Burrito Drive for (duh) burritos, Ichiban for good Chinese, Glass Nickel for pizza, Banzo for falafel. Yup, Resale on Commercial is great. Also, Mad City Music Exchange on Willy, and Ear Wax on Gilman for punk/metal.  OK, but Fair Trade Coffee House (2 blocks down State, same owners) is better--fewer annoying people, more space, fireplace in the winter, tiny secluded back patio in the summer, Not specifically a gay bar, and next to, but not attached to laundromat.  No idea, I've taken my Mercedes and Saab cars to Reese Auto on Stoughton Rd and gotten great service. In general, beware of downtown 'foreign car specialists' as many are 'clueless student ripoff specialists'.  No idea. Middleton is a whole nother world.  Anywhere in western Dane County is pretty much a good scenic drive. I also like the further reaches of Hwy 14 down around Belleville/Brooklyn. Wisconsin is the most beautiful place in the world.  Guadalajara is good, but Mercado Marimar is the BEST. No idea. The UP is awesome! It used to be part of Wisconsin, donchanow? I've never been to Madeline Island."

Drugs available for purchase in Laundromat."
madisonwi,3d6ago,legsintheair,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:33:02 2015 UTC,"1) Yes, absolutely.  Positively.  There are like 4 tours, and I have done them all.  I have done some of them multiple times.  Definitely a good way to get some FLW love on.  There are also a few FLW structures in town you can see... the Unitarian Meeting house next to the UW Hospital is one, there is a home in the University heights neighborhood, and there is another home in the Westmorland neighborhood.  There could be others.  Of course you can't very easily get tours of the private homes... but maybe you know the right people.  Now - having said that, the tours are totally worth the money, that is a relative thing.  If I were working for minimum wage, I would probably feel differently.  2) For Brunch I am thinking Marigold, Sunprint, or the new place in the USBank building... I am blanking on it's name, but it faces E Wash.  3) Mount Horeb.  Dubuque WI.  Galena IL also fits that bill... probably better.  Monroe is nice, particularly in the run-up to Christmas.  The Sq in Baraboo is cutsie.  there is a good shop for wine tasting on the second floor of one of the buildings.  If you want to go a little further the Amana Colonies in Iowa are a fun trip.  If you are looking for day trips a drive along the Mississippi will never let you down.  4) Janssen Shoe repair on willy across from the co-op is where you want to go.  I have been to the place by Mana, and they couldn't do simple work... Janssen's does have a creepy Christian vibe happening, but they do good work.  I'm also a bit sensitive to the Christian thing... you may not notice.  If you can overlook it, they are the people to go to.  5) Burrito Drive is prime.  So is New Orleans takeout.  Any of the asian places are amazing.  6) I don't know shit about record shops - it seems like every third person in this town is a DJ - so I don't need to know too much about it - everyone else does.  But I think the place you are thinking of is on Commercial Ave between ADC Lock and Key and the gas station.  It looks like a complete hole in the wall but I am told it is a lagit business.  7) Define Good.  My two favorite coffee shops in town are Lakeside Street and Froth house.  The only place I actively dislike is Mother Fools, or Starbucks.  8)  Not a LGBT Bar... we have four, Plan B, Shamrock, Woofs and Club 5... But then I have never been to Caribou...  9) ABRA is a franchise.  I wouldn't take my car there.  I DO go to Dutche's on the east side by the East side Woodmans.  It is hard to get an appointment - but the work is quality and the price is right AND the owner is the most honest mechanic I have ever met.  Hence, hard to get an appointment.  10) no clue.  I assume that Craftsman is spendy - but I have never been.  11) I drive a MINI Cooper, I like the area out west of the Middleton Airport - curvy, hilly, delightful.  Otherwise you are probably going to have to go to the river to get a lot of scenic in your drive.  Anywhere with trees is awesome in the fall.  12) Ok.  I need to stop you right there.  I grew up in California.  If you are looking for real mil spec Mexican food, you can forget it.  This is Wisconsin.  It isn't happening.  That said - the place in the parking lot of the east side Woodman's is good.  Habanero's off of 51 is the closest you will come.  If you want a serious sit-down joint you are out of luck... Lorados is safe, but that is about it.  13) I don't do yoga, but I have heard good things about the Perfect Knot off of Willie, but again, I know squat about it.  14) Go in the summer.  If you go in the winter you may not make it out alive.  Be prepared to get called a troll or a flatlander, or both.  it is an inhospitable land, and those who make it their home are a special breed."

Goodman obviously if you can get in early and don't mind a crowded lane. Shorewood has a nice pool but I'm not sure if day passes are sold without a member accompanying you.

madisonwi,3d5v6d,dontdrinksoymilk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:14:53 2015 UTC,The water is warm now. Boats are only a problem on Saturday and Sunday afternoon but its still best to stay near the shore. I don't think you need a wetsuit now but I know many people do later. If you are serious I would find a group to go with. I now there are a few groups. One is an ironman training group.

This is one of those laws that's kind of bullshit for both sides. You deserve to live with your dog and not be discriminated against. But at the same time, there are many landlords who don't want animals in their property and would be understandably upset if someone forced their way in with a service dog."
madisonwi,3d5siu,new-money,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:32:21 2015 UTC,It's not just the landlords.  Many people do not like/want to live with dogs.  Or they may even have allergies to dogs.  It is unfair to them if they have selected an apartment that did not allow dogs to suddenly force them to live with dogs nearby.

madisonwi,3d5siu,name_with_a_y,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:09:06 2015 UTC,"Agreed - some people have severe anxiety around dogs or extreme allergies.  This is more serious than people just not being ""dog people"", and it's something others don't often think about.  So it's always best to look for buildings that already allow dogs.  But it's also helpful to know the law if, for example, you moved into an apartment when you did not have a service animal or ESA and now need to have one."
madisonwi,3d5siu,Mswindupbird89,2,Mon Jul 13 23:20:09 2015 UTC,"You're correct - they are considered to be pieces of medical equipment rather than pets so your landlord would be violating the ADA if they said they weren't allowed.  They can charge extra security deposits and charge your for damages the animal may cause so long as this is a policy they would enforce with all their tenants.  They may ask for documentation that the pet is needed but they can't ask specific questions about what conditions or disabilities you have.  Of course, just because it's against the law for your landlord to say no or discriminate doesn't mean they won't.  I've found many landlords don't understand that they are required by law to allow you to have the pet.  If you suspect your landlord is discriminating against you, try to document it in writing and save the paper trail.  Similarly, if someone denies you an apartment and you suspect it's because of your ESA, request a reason why you were denied and see if they're dumb enough to tell you that's why.  Edit: This will explain it better than I can"

Those are the two places I can think of with a large selection, and I've outlined the issues with them. Hopcat has 30 local beers on tap at all times (rotating selection).

If you're that far east you're also close to Malt House, Dexter's and Tip Top, all of which have great food and constantly rotate their taps amongst the best beers in the world. You could go west too, to places like Craftsman Table and Tap, Free House, or Vintage Brewing. The north side has Ale Asylum and Karben 4 for brewpubs, and Lazy Oaf has a decent amount of taps.

I've been to a HopCat in Michigan, and I think their culture is better than what I know of Mr. Brews.

madisonwi,3cxxqk,WorkplaceWatcher,3,Sun Jul 12 14:57:30 2015 UTC,"HopCat was pretty chill when I visited the Grand Rapids location. I hope the chaos was just for an opening.   HopCat won't be my favorite bar, but I'm excited to have a good bar with this tap diversity in town.    It's also a great place for the older UW students to explore craft beer. I turned 21 in Atlanta. I tried many dozens of styles at a HopCat style bar (Taco Mac).  It was an important step in my beer nerd development.  I hope that HopCat gets friendly with their distributors and pulls in beers we don't commonly see. I wasn't jazzed with their opening lineup,  but I'm optimistic."
madisonwi,3cxxqk,evandena,2,Sun Jul 12 15:04:08 2015 UTC,HopCat was pretty chill when I visited the Grand Rapids location.   This gives me hope. I'm approaching 30 years old and I really don't have the energy or social desire to deal with a sports-bar sort of activity. I just want a nice place that has a ton of beers where I can hang out - and if it's pretty chill at other locations maybe it'll be really nice for me too.

madisonwi,3cxxqk,NSubsetH,3,Mon Jul 13 01:01:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'll go. At some point. When the crowd is not the crowd in the picture. I'm willing to pay a bit more anywhere I can have a little space. And time. If you're going to have 130 beers on tap, it's going to take me a few minutes to decide which I want.

madisonwi,3cxxqk,layer555,5,Sat Jul 11 21:12:45 2015 UTC,"The line is because they're giving away (well, gave away, past tense) 250 prepaid cards for free crack fries for a year (1 order per week).

madisonwi,3cqclf,frezik,3,Fri Jul 10 04:14:16 2015 UTC,"You are making the assumption that all home owners will choose fiber as there internet.   Verizon thought the same thing with FIOS. Turns out, when they started rolling this out into areas with Comcast that Comcast magically reduced their prices under the cost of FIOS causing them to lose subscribers. You can expect Charter, TDS, and AT&T to do the same. At that point it becomes a real tough sell to consumers, 1gbps for $60/month (assuming it actually costs $60) vs 100 mbps at $30/month. The ""its faster"" line doesn't really matter to a vast majority of people, especially in lower income neighborhoods (as a WSJ survey of KC found).   What really concerns me is the cost cited. $5-$10K is substantially higher than other installations I am familiar with. In fact, it approaches Utopia's costs in Utah which is a really bad sign (Utopia turned into a disaster and an albatross to city finances to the point a special tax is now levied each month to every household regardless if they get service to pay for it). The $2-3K price point is around the range where fiber is viable for a well planned installation for municipal networks."
madisonwi,3cqclf,The_Drizzle_Returns,3,Fri Jul 10 04:49:26 2015 UTC,"There are larger issues at play than raw bandwidth. I actually think the bandwidth increase doesn't matter in the least; even two simultaneous 4k video streams won't saturate a 100mbps line, and it's not at all obvious what would take up more bandwidth than that for the average user. Most of the arguments I've heard against this fact tend to misunderstand the differences between bandwidth, latency, throughput, router packet processing speed, and server processing speed.  What I'm more concerned with is the long term implications. Whomever installs the glass first owns it forever. It's an end of the road technology--that is, once you have it, there's no reason to use anything else, at least not for the foreseeable future. I'd like it to be myself and my fellow citizens who own it, not TDS, Verizon, Charter, etc."

madisonwi,3cp6uf,new-money,4,Thu Jul 9 18:53:38 2015 UTC,"$7.50 for 32oz is ""very, very expensive""? You're buying some cheap-ass beer, my friend. Great Dane's 22oz bomber bottles are, I believe, typically more than that by a buck or two, and a growing percentage of 22oz bottles are into double digits.  Would you call $3.25 for a pint at a bar ""very, very expensive""?"
madisonwi,3cp6uf,thebookpolice,-5,Thu Jul 9 19:11:09 2015 UTC,"Would you call $3.25 for a pint at a bar ""very, very expensive""?   Did you even read my post?

madisonwi,3cp6uf,new-money,2,Thu Jul 9 19:26:37 2015 UTC,"I did, though I misdirected my reply. But would it be a very expensive single? No, not really. Singles typically sell for $2, frequently more. Considering this will be beer you can't buy in a package anywhere else, there's a scarcity that factors into the pricing. This is a slightly expensive beer.  Let's look at some locally popular beers in large format packages.    Toppling Goliath pseudoSue: $.32 per ounce ($7 for a 22oz bottle) Black Husky 12-Dog Imperial Stout: $.41 per ounce ($9 for a 22oz bottle) Schell Starkeller Peach: $.59 per ounce ($15 for a 750mL bottle) Anything in a 32oz/$7.50 Crowler from Great Dane: $.23 per ounce    Great Dane's a bargain!"
madisonwi,3cp6uf,thebookpolice,-5,Thu Jul 9 19:42:06 2015 UTC,"That is some flawed logic. You started by saying:   Singles typically sell for $2, frequently more.   Which means this beer is 62.5% more expensive than a typical single.  You then proceeded to list other very expensive beers to compare with, claiming that it's a bargain, when really you just showed it fits right in with the expensive beer camp.  And if you honestly think ""scarcity"" significantly affects the price of beer in this case, I will just sit back and laugh at you."

Evaluating the relative expensiveness of one 32oz crowler of beer compared to one 12oz single bottle of beer doesn't mean much unless you're comparing the cost by volume.

madisonwi,3cp6uf,1st-rate,4,Thu Jul 9 18:06:34 2015 UTC,A half size growler would be a smaller footprint because it can be reused. Crowlers really don't add much in terms of freshness either. They are just for novelty.

You're off base on the freshness thing, though. Crowlers store much longer than growlers. You can get a few weeks out of an unopened growler before it starts to lose too much carb and oxidize. I've had a crowler that was months old, though, and still carbonated and tasty. A quick google search will support this."

madisonwi,3copkd,lol_wutdafuq,15,Thu Jul 9 19:34:22 2015 UTC,"106.50(5m)(em), Stats.  Wisconsin's fair housing law does not apply in any way to people sharing a single unit. It remains perfectly legal to reject potential roommates for gender, race, religion, age, etc. all of which are very much prohibited when leasing someone an entire unit.  EDIT: and a Federal cite.... the FHA only applies to a ""dwelling"", which doesn't include a roommate situation. The best explanation is in Fair Housing Council of San Fernando Valley v. Roommate.com.  It is illegal to advertise in a discriminatory way except for gender. So while you can't say ""no gays or Jews, especially no gay Jews"" in your ad, you can reject potential roommates all day long for being gay and/or Jewish."

I don't really feel like finding the citation/case but I'm sure you can if you want. It common sense though. The law can't and won't force the trans person to live with a homophobe/transaphobe either. If the OP doesn't feel the numerous people who confirm the same thing they can waste their time bothering a lawyer but I'm not.
madisonwi,3copkd,postrnut,-1,Thu Jul 9 21:01:35 2015 UTC,Fair enough I actually agree it seems like common sense. But would you agree that someone who experienced this would be better served talking to organizations or city departments specifically set up to handle discrimination complaints instead of taking the word of Internet strangers and a guy who 'took a real estate law class'?   Even characterizing an inquiry with Dept. of Civil Rights and Tenant Resource Center as a 'waste of time' might discourage from getting advice from actual experts. That is my main point.   (And I would caution anyone who makes advice based on a 'real estate law' class that there can be sticky situations when giving what can be termed 'legal advice' when one is not a lawyer or in a lawyer-client relationship.)
madisonwi,3copkd,when_wolf,5,Thu Jul 9 21:12:47 2015 UTC,"... it's common sense.  Imagine this scenario.  You post an ad looking for a roommate, someone replies. You find out they are a super creep [or insert other bad quality] you tell them, I'm sorry but your lifestyle and mine clash and I don't think we can be compatible. Thank you for informing me, but I cannot offer you the room.   Neither of them should be forced to live together because one person feels they were wronged. Would you want legal to come back and say I'm sorry but you cannot discriminate this person gets to move into your house.  Um... no. I have friends I wouldn't even let move in with me because their day yo day lifestyles are too much for me.   Yes, the letter was rude but you cannot be forced to live with someone you don't want to. For any reason."
madisonwi,3copkd,postrnut,-6,Thu Jul 9 21:28:06 2015 UTC,"Ok. Let me be clear: Yes, it seems like common sense you can't be forced to live with someone you don't want to live with. And I would agree with those who said everyone is better off in this situation. But that does not necessarily mean this is not a form of illegal discrimination.  The law does not equal common sense. People spend three years of their lives and additional CLE hours learning about the law, in part because it is not always just 'common sense'.   Anti-discrimination law revolves around a number of protected classes, specific segments of society that are not allowed to be discriminated against in accommodation, employment, housing, etc. This may include race, gender, etc.   However, being a jerk, being sloppy, and being a shitty roommate are not protected classes. Super creep is not a protected class. You can discriminate against slobs, jerks, and super creeps. No one claiming otherwise.  In Madison, transgender people are a protected class. It seems there could be a conflict between the anti-discrimination protections for this trans individual, and an individuals right to choose with whom they share a home.  This is the exact reason I have repeatedly encouraged OP to talk to actual experts, and not take as final a bunch of reddit comments."

Obviously people turn away potential roommates for a variety of reasons, and no one is really expected to live with someone they don't get along with.  But if that reason why you don't want to live with someone is a protected class, maybe don't put it in writing, or even verbalize it to anyone ever."
madisonwi,3copkd,n609mike,35,Thu Jul 9 20:03:12 2015 UTC,No idea if trans is protected either way but from what I understand its legal to discriminate for many reasons for a roommate situation but not a typical landlord situation.

Wis Stat 106.50(5m)(em)1 provides an exemption for individuals making decisions about their roommates so long as the unit is occupied by five or fewer persons.   In any case, if you think you've been a victim of housing discrimination, consider contacting the Fair Housing Center (http://www.fairhousingwisconsin.com/) or visit us at the Tenant Resource Center to find out more about overcoming barriers to housing.

My understanding of the law (and I am a REALTOR® and not a lawyer - I am not giving you legal advice) is that a roommate situation is different, that roommates CAN discriminate in this way.

With a roommate situation I would just drop it and move on, they may be shitty but they haven't broken the law, and you don't want to room with someone who has been up front in self-identifying as an asshole.  Despite the city ordinance discrimination absolutely does happen in Madison.

I agree with everyone who says it's not a situation you would want to be in-- on the other hand, having an advocate like the Tenant Resource Center speak up for your rights can make a change, even if it's a small one. People like this need to know they're in the wrong. Also...hugs."

madisonwi,3copkd,readinginbed,0,Thu Jul 9 16:41:32 2015 UTC,"By ""in the wrong"" do you mean legally or socially?  Legally they are on pretty solid ground.    Socially - they just failed at life."

For example, I wouldn't rent a room to you because I do not respect your intelligence. That is my right. There is nothing socially wrong with that. I am not expected to like everyone. The reasons for why I do not like you don't matter, because it is my private dwelling that I do not wish to share with you."

It was fun, but they didn't have their full tap list last night, only the local 30 and I thought they could have made some better selections there. The full list looks amazing. Foods pretty solid, some of the same stuff they have at the other hopcats. They did a nice job renovating that building."

The building renovations are nice and the art was pretty dope.  The food was spectacular. I don't know anything about the franchise so I was gladly surprised by the crack fries, which are indeed delicious and addictive.  My only major complaints is that they have multiple menus. Meaning that my party ordered food without knowing there were other options. Also in general the staff seemed wildly inexperienced. I know it was their first night but most of the servers seemed aloof and the bartenders constantly needed us to explain how to make the drinks we ordered.  I will be going back though. Them fries bruh."
madisonwi,3cpm23,layer555,2,Fri Jul 10 17:25:20 2015 UTC,You ordered drinks?  Seems like they hired people off the street.

It consists of a light blue background bisected from lower left to upper right by a white band. These symbolize Lake Mendota and Lake Monona and the isthmus between them. In the center of the flag is a black cross which symbolizes the four lakes (Mendota, Monona, Wingra and Waubesa) as well as the cross shape of the Wisconsin State Capitol building. Overlaid on the cross is an Indian Sun symbol. (This symbol is similar to the sun symbols seen on the state flag of New Mexico and on the municipal flags of Wichita, Kansas and Albuquerque, New Mexico.)

madisonwi,3cp63m,GeekResponsibly,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:44:13 2015 UTC,"It might just be their policy, since they card at the door on crowded nights, which are also the nights when they don't want minors filling seats that won't be purchasing alcohol. But this will be the case everywhere downtown unless it is more of a restaurant than a bar."
madisonwi,3cp63m,new-money,6,Thu Jul 9 19:01:52 2015 UTC,"Well WI law means minors are allowed in any bar and can even drink with parent permission. I guess some bars may have different policy, but I never had an issue getting in anywhere when my parents 'claimed' me."
madisonwi,3cp63m,GeekResponsibly,2,Thu Jul 9 19:04:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, but they also have the right to refuse service and as you said, they may have their own policies.

madisonwi,3cp63m,new-money,2,Thu Jul 9 19:11:43 2015 UTC,"Had a few more suggestions until I noticed you were looking for somewhere to go at midnight, so I guess that limits things to places that keep bar hours.  If you like playing Pool, you could go to The Brass Ring. I mostly go there for the Pool tables, but the food has been decent whenever I've been there. They also have a shuffleboard table there, but if you want to play shuffleboard I'd actually recommend the Great Dane instead.  The Weary Traveller has excellent food and good atmosphere, but I will warn you that on a Friday or Saturday night it's likely going to be packed."

I doubt they will have a problem with it at all."
madisonwi,3cov28,rgibson7usa,2,Thu Jul 9 16:11:56 2015 UTC,There seem to be about a billion new condos developed in the west part of SP over the past decade.   This seems like it will be impossible to sell.  Along with the reasons in the article below condos don't really go up in value.  http://www.frugalwoods.com/2014/05/09/7-reasons-condos-can-be-a-bad-investment/
madisonwi,3cov28,n609mike,0,Thu Jul 9 17:54:46 2015 UTC,"Condos generally appreciate at the same rate as houses and other real estate, which is roughly equal to inflation. A condo or a house is not an investment if it is your primary residence.  The article you linked should be a good enough reason not to buy a condo, especially if you are young."
madisonwi,3cov28,new-money,3,Thu Jul 9 18:59:20 2015 UTC,"Condos generally appreciate at the same rate as houses and other real estate, which is roughly equal to inflation.   This is only true if you own the land too. Land goes up in value while improvements depreciate. With most condos you only own the improvements so your entire investment depreciates.     A condo or a house is not an investment if it is your primary residence.   I know what you are trying to say but I have made ridiculous amounts of money off my primary residences."
madisonwi,3cov28,n609mike,0,Thu Jul 9 19:22:50 2015 UTC,"We are basically in agreement, but many condos do not depreciate because while you do not own the land, the condo will forever be on that land. So as the value of the land rises, the condo's value often does as well. Inflation also applies to improvements, not just the land. (Obviously different situations for different condos in different locations)"
madisonwi,3cov28,new-money,2,Thu Jul 9 19:31:08 2015 UTC,"It's my understanding that owners typically (as a part of the condo owner's association), do own a share of the land. Not an undivided interest - as you can have upstairs neighbors occupy the same footprint of the lot that the building is built upon - but a legal share nonetheless that can appreciate in value."
madisonwi,3cov28,n609mike,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:45:56 2015 UTC,Either way the fees are usually enough of a reason to not make it a good idea financially. I would find a small simple structurally sound house in a decent neighborhood.
madisonwi,3cov28,The_Drizzle_Returns,0,Thu Jul 9 21:13:03 2015 UTC,"I know what you are trying to say but I have made ridiculous amounts of money off my primary residences.   You could have made substantially more money in the stock market over the same time frame. Houses shouldn't be treated as investments, they should be treated as a consumption good like a car."
madisonwi,3cov28,n609mike,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:41:50 2015 UTC,No i could not have. I don't know who you are trying to direct your should too but its far from universal. If people know nothing about stocks they shouldn't invest heavily in them. If people know nothing about houses and real estate markets they shouldn't invest in them. Stocks are far harder to make substantially more money than average. An average person can basically not buy a stock under market value while anyone can find a house under market if they work at it.
madisonwi,3cov28,The_Drizzle_Returns,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:00:45 2015 UTC,"No i could not have. I don't know who you are trying to direct your should too but its far from universal.    Yes you could have.   If people know nothing about stocks they shouldn't invest heavily in them.   Its called an S&P 500 Index Fund or an S&P 500 Mutual Fund. Both of which have appreciated more than housing prices have if you bought and sold at any point in the last 90 years. Robert Shiller has laid this out pretty clearing in the many interviews he has given on this topic.    Stocks are far harder to make substantially more money than average.   The average you make on stocks is substantially higher (by several percentage points before you account for dividends) than housing. This dates back to 1890 (when records of the two were first collected).    An average person can basically not buy a stock under market value while anyone can find a house under market if they work at it.   They don't have to. You can by a index fund today at current market value and you will be better off than people who buy a house even if they buy it substantially under market value. Nothing illistrates this more than the housing crisis. You could have bought at the lowest point and still made less half what you could have made in an index fund.   Unless you are running an actual property investment company, homes are full stop not investments and they should never be treated as one."
madisonwi,3cov28,killcpm,0,Thu Jul 9 22:08:17 2015 UTC,Just because you read in a book somewhere that real estate shouldn't be treated as an investment doesn't mean people don't make a lot of money on real estate and sometimes in the short term even outperform the stock market. It's pretty simple to understand...buy a house and sell it three years later for more than your average stock index return over the same period. Yes most people can't and probably shouldn't try to do this but you act like it's impossible.
madisonwi,3cov28,The_Drizzle_Returns,0,Fri Jul 10 02:07:42 2015 UTC,"Just because you read in a book somewhere that real estate shouldn't be treated as an investment doesn't    I didn't read it in a book anywhere. Robert Shiller (Nobel Prize Winning Economist who won his Nobel prize for modeling US housing markets) said the exact statement that housing shouldn't be treated as an investment it should be treated as a consumer good like a car.    people don't make a lot of money on real estate and sometimes in the short term even outperform the stock market.   People make money in real estate but the gains historically are under inflation. Unless ""short term"" is something like a week you would be hard pressed to find people even in the hottest markets who outpreformed index funds in the last 10 years. You have to be an extremely sophisticated investor in housing to consistently outperform the market (and no, 99% of people are not this).    buy a house and sell it three years later for more than your average stock index return over the same period   There has been no time in the last 80 years this has occurred."
madisonwi,3cov28,n609mike,0,Fri Jul 10 03:05:29 2015 UTC,"In about 5 years I turned less than $5,000 into over $75,000. If you have an index fund that can do that let me know. I have made similar returns 3 other times. Just because you can't doesn't mean other can't and don't everyday."

madisonwi,3cma4y,jnkang2,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:36:21 2015 UTC,"I have been getting treatment from the UW Health Sports Medicine clinic for ACL and MCL injuries I sustained in February. The clinic is great and I had a great experience with the orthopedic doc (Gregory Landry, but he's downsizing his practice, I think to focus on pediatrics), surgeon (Warren Dunn - awesome!!), and PT (Beth Chorlton) I worked with. Would recommend them and the clinic to anyone, but obviously I can't speak to your specific situation of a weightlifting injury. I'm on Unity insurance, so this may differ for you if you aren't, but I was able to call the sports medicine clinic after my injury and they set me up with the first doctor who had an available appointment. I'm guessing if you give the clinic a call they would be able to recommend the best person for your situation.  Best of luck!"
madisonwi,3cma4y,jwhease,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:24:41 2015 UTC,"I assume you have insurance? How long has the injury been bothering you? Describe the injury better than that.  Depending on how long you've had the injury and severity I'd say screw it and go to your doctor and request an MRI. I had an injury from squats and MRI revealed herniated disc. After years of on and off again pain I just had surgery last year. If you're a power lifter, young, and already have severe pain something needs to be addressed before you set yourself up for a lifetime of pain."
madisonwi,3ckjw2,urmomhasaids,3,Wed Jul 8 17:06:01 2015 UTC,Are most of the beers exchanged not available in the Wisconsin market?
madisonwi,3ckjw2,killcpm,2,Wed Jul 8 21:16:18 2015 UTC,"unfortunately, it's not; I've asked before.  It's an ok idea but, to your point, it's not hard to find local beer.  I wish there was something like this for out-of-WI beer since I have to travel a bunch for work I've got a good mix of Austin, Dallas, Chicago, WV, KY crafts that I'm slowly chiseling away at.   But, of course, I'm not going to trade them for a Hopolicious or a Spotted Cow"
madisonwi,3ckjw2,terrenceistheman,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:08:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is confusing."
madisonwi,3ckjw2,IH8DwnvoteComplainrs,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:48:46 2015 UTC,"It's pretty simple.  If you decide to come to an exchange, you bring two six packs of craft beer.  You then trade with everyone else so you end up with a bunch of different craft beers.  Etiquette rules:  Don't be too boring, don't bring garbage like Miller Lite."
madisonwi,3ckjw2,killcpm,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:08:33 2015 UTC,"It's been a good mix.  Usually, it is has been about 50% WI/50% out of state. Recently, we have had a core of 4-6 people making exchanges and that group has been bringing significantly more out of state beers.    I also feel that as we do more of these and people try to bring different things, it tends to favor out of state beers.  I'm personally quite alright with this had led me to new things/brewers.    Another trend is that we're seeing people request less IPAs be brought or at least ones that have a unique twist to them (or have some significant history).  I don't know why, but they're becoming SO popular lately.  One early exchange, we had 8 people show up.  7 people brought one pack of an IPA.  5 brought two packs.  Because of this, that core 4-6 have been following an informal rule to try to emphasize bringing something other than IPAs.  If we brought an IPA, we'd limit it to one six pack.  The variety for types of beers has been generally pretty good though.  For example, last exchange, I had one IPA (with an orange twist to it), one plain IPA, two stouts, one Kolsch, one tripel, one amber,  one scottish ale, one cream ale, one blonde ale, and two wheat beers.    That one was particularly varied though."
madisonwi,3ckjw2,killcpm,2,Wed Jul 8 21:54:24 2015 UTC,The question is/was; are the out of state beers ones in which you cannot buy in Wisconsin? I'm busy tonight but may be interested in checking this out some other time.
madisonwi,3ckjw2,z3ugma,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:10:12 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I think I still don't understand what you're asking.  If you're asking if beers brought are those you can't purchase in WI, the answer is usually no.    EDIT:  Feel free to PM me as well."
madisonwi,3ckjw2,evandena,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:56:10 2015 UTC,If the beers are all ones that you can find in the Wisconsin market what is the point of going and trading with strangers in some park? Why not just go to the liquor store and buy the beer?
madisonwi,3ckjw2,doxiegrl1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:25:30 2015 UTC,"Because to try 12 different beers, I would need to buy 12 different packs.   The build your owns also tend to be limited or force you to buy a huge ass bottle.  For example, Doghead Fish has been hard for me recently to find a decent selection for build your owns.    The main point though is having people throw their own suggestions out.  It results in getting things one wouldn't normally buy (a whole six pack) for oneself.  For example, this group has really gotten me into Scotch Ales recently and I doubt I would have gotten this into them on my own.    Rumor has it that there are also a TON of beers and even the most enthusiastic beer drinker has only touched a small fraction of them.  Not to mention that most of us go to that store or two for our beers and are limited by what those stores have.  Yes, Woodman's has a lot or your favorite liquor store has a great selection, but they don't have every beer.  Finally, thanks to this group, I'm learning what liquor stores carry those hard to find crafts.    TLDR:  We want to try more beers and have some fun with it, so it seems advantageous for us to leverage each other."
madisonwi,3ckjw2,evandena,2,Thu Jul 9 16:55:26 2015 UTC,Then you're the person I want to talk to!  I haven't been to this park before.  Is there a particular parking lot or place that I could easily describe for the meet up?
madisonwi,3ckjw2,evandena,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:59:44 2015 UTC,well sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet!  We just picked it because it was close to the person moving.  I'll have to send a message to meet by the center field area.  This should be ....adventurous!  (Thank you!)
madisonwi,3ckjw2,evandena,2,Wed Jul 8 21:05:09 2015 UTC,"For those who recently joined the group and will be doing tonight's exchange, keep a look out for a message at the facebook group.  If I feel we're having a hard time finding each other, I will post a message there.  Other (urgent) updates will go there as well."

It's been fine and I have had no problems reception-wise.  I'm on AT&T by the way.  The phone itself has been frustrating.  When it updated to Android 5.01, I had touch screen issues and typing was nearly impossible  The customer service was horrible.  I eventually had to wipe the phone and install the Oxygen OS getting rid of CM.  I don't think I'll be moving on to the OP2.

madisonwi,3ckspr,WISMBA,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:41:52 2015 UTC,"To be fair to the OPO, many phones from various manufacturers have had issues with updating to 5.01. The consensus is that a factory wipe after updating fixes the issue. I don't think it's a OPO issue, it's an android issue."

Numerous problems of all sorts, including erratic touchscreen detection, random hanging, and frequent app crashes. It's a commonly discussed issue in many forums, nothing I've read has indicated that it's a OPO issue.   Customer support is an entirely different issue, it sucks that they're not putting adequate effort into that."
madisonwi,3ckspr,v-porphyria,0,Thu Jul 9 20:28:22 2015 UTC,"I have a Nexus 4, which also only has LTE Band 4. So, it's similar, but not exactly the same.    I was on T-mobile before and the data coverage outside of Madison was an issue (basically non-existent).  I switched to StraightTalk (AT&T) first and then recently switched to Cricket (AT&T) because it is cheaper.  Service using AT&T towers in the Madison area has been better than T-mobile in my experience.  I mostly get HSPA+, but there are a few LTE areas on Band 4.  I'm happy with Cricket and would recommend the service (even if you don't get the OnePlus One)."

Rather than allowing each tenant to put up a dish, none of which ever get taken down when tenants move out, they may have invested in a single dish that can be used by all.  And having dealt with plenty of incredibly lazy installs in properties, some that caused permanent damage, there is good reason to limit this type of work to just a single contractor who knows how to do it properly and to your standards."

madisonwi,3chqrj,killcpm,2,Wed Jul 8 12:31:17 2015 UTC,"Generally when a merger occurs, a lot of employees, policies, and procedures are merged as well. It's possible that the stricter policies are in place due to the merger, or simply due to an influx of people bluffing that they will cancel their service.

madisonwi,3chqrj,hrpeanut,6,Wed Jul 8 02:32:23 2015 UTC,There's no real competition. AT&T U-verse isn't half of what it should be. Any DSL offerings are jokes. Wireless offerings aren't really materializing.  Cable is where it's at until somebody lays gigabit fiber. Whomever owns that fiber will be the final monopoly player.
madisonwi,3chqrj,nexusanarchy,3,Wed Jul 8 13:32:02 2015 UTC,Cable is where it's at until somebody lays gigabit fiber. Whomever owns that fiber will be the final monopoly player.   TDS is laying fiber in Verona & Waunakee as we speak.  They only sell 50/20 connections unbundled though.  You can get up to Gigabit if you want to buy every channel and add-on package.

madisonwi,3chqrj,895342,2,Wed Jul 8 03:18:21 2015 UTC,I just did this a couple of weeks ago after my first year of the promotion. I can't speak to next year but the way I see it they'll get $40 or $0 so I don't see why they would ever let anyone go.  You can also just cancel for 3 months and become a new customer again. Cancel for the summer and go outside Madison!
madisonwi,3chqrj,hometownkc,2,Wed Jul 8 11:45:15 2015 UTC,"If you use a slightly different email (I think gmail lets you add periods to your address) and a different phone number (like your work phone) you can get the intro deal again. If you whine about wanting the $30 intro that's given you once or twice a year you can probably get it, though I had to call twice before I found a sympathetic ear. We just moved and used the different phone/email to reset our bill.  When I had ATT I stayed on their crappy $20 deal Internet by using the phrase ""there's a cheaper deal in my area so I'm thinking of switching"". ATT's service is way worse though, so they may just cave no matter what."
madisonwi,3chqrj,Th3LaughingMan,2,Wed Jul 8 12:12:16 2015 UTC,"I've been doing that too, and last time they almost called my bluff on cancelling.  So I held strong, they transferred me to their cancellation department, and after they asked why I was cancelling, they went ahead and made the price change at the last minute to retain me.  Basically be ready to cancel, force them to call your bluff, and if all else really fails, cancel, there are cheaper options out there."
madisonwi,3chqrj,JKibbs,2,Wed Jul 8 16:42:27 2015 UTC,"I recently ended my service with Charter after being a customer for 8 years for this very reason.  I was paying $65 for internet service (had no other service with them) and since everyone else I know is paying only $45ish I thought this was unreasonable.  I called the cancellation line and straight out told them I would move to a different service if they didn't lower my bill.  They said I was already paying the ""everyday low price"" and there was nothing they could do for me.  I then stated clearly I would move to a different service and didn't even want them to offer me a better deal the next time I called.  Fast forward a week, got service with TDS, called Charter to cancel and as soon as I said I moved to a different company they offered me $40 service.  They said it was a ""new promotion"" they were giving away since two weeks prior...but I call B.S. on that.  I still followed through with the cancel.  I've spent the last 6 years (since the first promo was used up) playing games with Charter.  I hope I never have to be their customer again."
madisonwi,3chqrj,madman86,2,Wed Jul 8 17:05:30 2015 UTC,I couldn't get mine reduced either so I cancelled. Called and got the promo as a new customer 30 days later.

madisonwi,3cft56,idontownanoutfit,2,Wed Jul 8 05:07:42 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you're being downvoted, Mr. Jackson is great. They probably want you to post this in /r/madisonmusic but that sub is dead."
madisonwi,3cft56,teethteetheat,5,Tue Jul 7 19:28:59 2015 UTC,With the relatively small size of this sub itself all those extra subs are unnecessary.  With that said this song is just terrible. Just because it's local(ly shot) doesn't mean I'm not going to be critical of it.
madisonwi,3cft56,layer555,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:31:53 2015 UTC,Down voting isn't a disagree button. Why do you think it's terrible?
madisonwi,3cft56,teethteetheat,3,Tue Jul 7 20:43:34 2015 UTC,"The beat sounds like it was made with an old casio keyboard. It's attempted unsyncopated rhythm comes off weak and half assed. After about 3 bars I skipped ahead to see if the song got any better. What I came to was the exact same beat with a sort of awful low pitched jazz croon. I tried a few times after that to watch the video in it's entirety, but there's just nothing unique or remarkable about the song."
madisonwi,3cft56,layer555,2,Tue Jul 7 20:56:22 2015 UTC,There's a weird flaw in the beat in the fifth measure. I can't say I hear it for sure in the thirteenth so maybe it's a 16-measure loop? It's definitely there throughout the song. It's subtle but enough to be distracting and disconcerting.  Also I wish there was a B part at least. The same thing over and over again makes the song feel much much longer than it actually is.  But it's great to see local people creating. Keep working on your craft!

madisonwi,3cd71e,sordfysh,16,Tue Jul 7 00:51:40 2015 UTC,"“Once a space has been converted to a restaurant and/or bar, it will likely never return to retail use,” the staff report says, citing expensive kitchen conversions, higher rent value per square foot and a larger footprint requirement than small retail stores.   Which makes sense, but this sort of thing can be addressed with zoning rather than multiplicative tax increases, can't it? Somehow, the above smells like post hoc reasoning."
madisonwi,3cd71e,frezik,2,Tue Jul 7 01:53:55 2015 UTC,"I don't know; somebody more knowledgeable in city politics can jump in any time here.  I do know, though, that restaurants run at very small profit margins, so something like this fee would be felt in the customer's and worker's wallets. If he were to do something similar to food carts, they'd probably close up shop."
madisonwi,3cd71e,juice369,5,Tue Jul 7 01:18:07 2015 UTC,there is a segment of people who want to see State Street businesses be diverse. Some clothing stores some bars some restaurants some that sell this some that sell that etc.

madisonwi,3cd71e,new-money,20,Wed Jul 8 21:18:56 2015 UTC,"Here's a crazy idea -- maybe retail shops are going out because... people don't want to shop there anymore? I'd like to think that consumerism has declined, but it's more likely that the effects of eCommerce have started to show. Retail shops can't afford the most expensive commercial space in the city. They are already competing with online shops who have comparatively minuscule overhead. Many of the remaining patrons of specialty shops travel directly to the shop and do not care to browse at multiple shops on State St. Being on State St also makes parking a hassle, which can deter customers.  If the market is naturally moving towards cafes and restaurants, let it happen. One of the highlights of Madison is our restaurant scene. It's better than stacking up more high rise apartment complexes, and the sidewalk seating areas add a nice energy to downtown."

madisonwi,3cd71e,noisette915,50,Tue Jul 7 18:40:24 2015 UTC,"Guys, this is $8k a year for businesses that already earn enough money to occupy the most valuable real estate in the city. It's practically nothing. It's not driving anyone out of business. And they are using public space, a sidewalk, that they do not own, in order to make money. The people of Madison own that space, so we're entitled to rent for it if a private party is going to profit off of its exclusive use. What we should be more fired up about is making sure that that money is put to good purpose by improving the area for everyone.   As for wanting more retail/hating restaurants, well, that's dumb and I disagree with the guy on that. We don't need more UW merchandise, tobacco/vape, thrift, and other assorted trashy stores. Keep the nicer restaurants and bars coming."
madisonwi,3cd71e,pizzainoven,22,Tue Jul 7 02:20:35 2015 UTC,"yeah, the more I think about it the more I realize that $750 per year rent for prime ccommercial real estate is an absolutely incredible deal. Basically a steal"
madisonwi,3cd71e,noisette915,11,Tue Jul 7 02:23:24 2015 UTC,"Also, if you look at the Cap Time photos in the article, the sidewalk seating in these areas occupies a large amount of public space. The lens makes it hard to see, but you can definitely see that the space for pedestrians on the public sidewalk is decreased by at least 50%."
madisonwi,3cd71e,mabris,12,Tue Jul 7 03:04:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think it's better to view this less as a new tax than as a correction of an outdated one. The old fee scheme was clearly designed for a less prosperous and booming city. Times have changed, and $750 a year no longer reflects the cost of real estate downtown."
madisonwi,3cd71e,nfromm,3,Tue Jul 7 02:32:22 2015 UTC,Not even a tax.  This is rent for use of public space.
madisonwi,3cd71e,iaurp,6,Tue Jul 7 18:03:36 2015 UTC,"Curious what folks think of the way the increased revenue will be spent - ""improving the downtown pedestrian experience, adding additional support for mall maintenance and creating and providing programming for State Street and the Capitol Square.""  The first part sounds reasonable to me. Takes a lot of work to maintain that area - see https://www.cityofmadison.com/parks/services/mallmaintenance.cfm  That last bit, though (""programming"") - does that mean the ""Top of State"" program? (For a critique, check out http://www.tonemadison.com/articles/art-is-not-a-band-aid/)"
madisonwi,3cd71e,TrynnaFindaBalance,12,Tue Jul 7 02:35:01 2015 UTC,"Sort of agree, but the proposed fee is higher than all of the other comparable cities that they looked at save for Miami (where $20/sqft a year isn't that bad of a deal since outdoor seating can be utilized year-round) and NYC.   Bumping the fee by 300%+ seems almost punitive in light of his comment about wanting more retail/fewer restaurants."
madisonwi,3cd71e,ScottWalkerSucks,2,Tue Jul 7 02:45:50 2015 UTC,Businesses are all about the margins. Huge and relatively arbitrary cost increases like this are enough to really hurt some smaller places.   I'm becoming less and less a fan of Soglin as time goes on. We could use a fresh face and someone who's a little more openminded.
madisonwi,3cd71e,vatoniolo,2,Wed Jul 8 21:21:55 2015 UTC,I hope places like Natspil can afford it.
madisonwi,3cd71e,vatoniolo,2,Tue Jul 7 15:54:28 2015 UTC,If I'm not mistaken the owners of Natt Spil own the real estate so they probably don't much care about $1 per month per square foot. It really is a pretty fair price
madisonwi,3cd71e,juice369,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:09:15 2015 UTC,"I've been told by business owners that this is as much as 10% of profits, which I actually beleive. I responded to them by asking if they think they can raise prices by 10% (over what they would have) or expect 10% more business given all the new high rises coming in. My view, which may be overly optimistic, is that the new development will increase business more than enough to cover these increases, especially by 2018"
madisonwi,3cd71e,eastsidewiscompton,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:21:36 2015 UTC,"I can understand your points, except that 8k is nothing. If you paid a part time employee- perhaps a janitor- 9.50/hour for 15 a week, that's almost 8k a year. Not that every restaurant will be paying 8k in fees, but there could be a few less cleaning crews, etc.   Owners really don't bring home that much, and like is said in another part of this thread, 8k is probably something like 10% of profits for a moderately successful restaurant."
madisonwi,3cd71e,snowzilla,8,Tue Jul 7 18:18:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if I'm for or against this, but let's take Ian's just for an example, because their potential ""rent"" of the sidewalk was the highest mentioned in this article.  If you round up to $9000 per year, that's less than $25 per day.  Given that an average ticket at a place like that is likely more than $25, we're talking about one order per day paying for the entire outdoor seating area on the city's most valuable property.  This fee isn't going to shut down any restaurants. It may be, like someone else suggested, fixing an outdated scale of ""rent.""  I mean seriously, they pay like $2 a day now, that's pretty crazy for the potential sales that the space can generate."
madisonwi,3cd71e,juice369,10,Tue Jul 7 04:55:34 2015 UTC,"A restaurant cannot really use the sidewalk space for from November through April. So that $25 per day is closer to $50 per usable day. Each order also has to include all the other expenses so it may be more like 5-10% of the first 10 orders would pay for this. Also I think a portion of the outdoor sales are taken from would-be customers that would have just sat inside.    So I think it has the potential to make things hard for smaller restaurants, they'll be in a damned if you do have outdoor seating (costs too much) damned if you don't (less visibility means fewer customers).    I think it would be reasonable to triple or quadruple the fee, but let's do it slowly and just make sure it doesn't have too great of an effect."
madisonwi,3cd71e,eastsidewiscompton,3,Tue Jul 7 13:24:01 2015 UTC,"I agree with these ideas. I wanted to further upon a point you had made; why are we talking about Ian's? They'll cough it up and still give their employees raises the same year. It's nothing for them, they're serving cheap ingredients  with a high markup(not that I don't love their product). I don't know if the same will be true for places like Nostrano, Red Sushi, or The Spot, who have small restaurants, small patios, smaller payrolls, and serve more premium ingredients with a higher food cost. I have a feeling it's the little guys who will suffer the most."

madisonwi,3cd71e,vatoniolo,4,Tue Jul 7 17:06:55 2015 UTC,"They handle hundreds of orders per day, $25 is not insane for an average ticket, considering that a whole pizza, apps and drinks could easily total $40.    Edit: apps, not all."
madisonwi,3cd71e,eastsidewiscompton,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:45:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, it could total $40, but that's very rare. I eat at Ians very often and haven't once seen anyone order a whole pizza and eat it there. Almost everyone gets 1-3 slices, and even 3 is rare."
madisonwi,3cd71e,vatoniolo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:30:39 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I still don't think it's an insane estimate.  I work in the industry too, even if you eat there every day you probably see a very small sample size of their daily volume.  They are definitely not staying open in that location with a $10 average ticket, that's just not possible."
madisonwi,3cd71e,aintgotany,3,Tue Jul 7 18:35:37 2015 UTC,I'm just going to ask: have you even been to Ians? The average ticket is SURELY less than $10. They just do crazy volume.
madisonwi,3cd71e,doxiegrl1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:17:12 2015 UTC,"I agree with the others. You're vastly overestimating the average ticket at Ian's.

Lakeside St. Coffee - Best views of the waterfront and comfy house feel, good coffee, very good sandwiches, nice flat benches, very fast and reliable wifi (used to be terrible), pretty good parking availability on side streets.  Bradbury's - Excellent coffee and crepes, but very tight seating and parking is difficult.  Barriques (W. Wash) - Good coffee and soups, very open seating plan, excellent and fast wifi, parking is ok for downtown since there are decent spots and ramps nearby.  Barriques (Park St) - Also good coffee/soups and seating, easier parking than W. Wash.  Collectivo (square) - Good coffee and sandwiches, not as good seating (shared benches) and annoying wifi (have to re-authenticate often)  Crema Cafe (Monona) - Good coffee, great sandwiches, comfortable but limited seating, very easy parking, good wifi.  Johnson Public House - Great coffee and sandwiches, good wifi, parking is a bit difficult, hipster vibe (good & bad :)  State Street coffee shops (Michelangelo, etc.) - Range from good to very good coffee, however almost all of the shops have terrible wifi and parking is difficult.  Chocolaterian Cafe - Great desserts, good coffee, ok parking, good wifi  Indie Coffee - Awesome waffles and great coffee, tight quarters but friendly--ruined by the worst wifi ever. Keep hoping it will work because I really like the place...it never does.  The Victory - Good coffee, but it's a wifi free zone."

There is a wide range of quality levels when folks start talking about coffee.  :)  For some, hot and recently brewed is enough.  For others (like myself, usually) I want freshly ground coffee from roasters who know what they are doing and baristas who know how to do a pour over or at least keep their drip systems very clean and fresh.

I think it's incredibly friendly and inviting, and that's why I go in two or three times a week. They also know what drink to make for me, and if they aren't busy they'll have it started as I come in.  The coffee is definitely good but probably not snobby. It works well for me. They have some nice bakery items and do some simple sandwiches.  Wifi is good when I've used it on my phone. My phone autoconnects there now, and I have zero issues. There are often people there with laptops.  Parking is so-so. The lot there is small, though if you know you're going to be there for a while you could park down the street (Davidson or Hegg) less than a block away.  I used to like Victory but have been less thrilled the last few times I've been in. I'll add a vote for Crema, especially for lunch. Daisy Cafe and Cupcakery is also good for coffee and lunch the few times I've been in, but I can't comment on wifi or laptops and seems to be a cafe and bakery first. Someone else here said Johnson Public House and Bradbury's have the best coffee, and I probably agree. I like Java Cat because it's my area of town, and they treat me well, but for quality (and snob factor), JPH and Bradbury's probably top the list."

madisonwi,3cdv1e,scy1192,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:44:46 2015 UTC,"Most of the major suburbs are a 20-40 minute drive downtown, depending on whether or not it's rush hour.  Try Sun Prairie (they're up and coming so tons of new suburban chain restaurants and stores if that's your thing), but also Verona, Middleton, Fitchburg, Monona.  There's not a lot of clear division between those closer suburbs and Madison because it all kind of just flows together.  As for cost of living - the rent and home prices are quite high for a city this size.  But I've noticed that houses to rent are not as unreasonably priced as large apartments are so you may be okay in that regard.  I've heard that food prices are relatively low because there's a lot of competition compared to some other places -- not sure how true that really is though but it doesn't seem unusually high to me.    The biggest problem you'll have is finding affordable parking downtown if your employer isn't providing it to you.  Expect to pay over $100/month.  Most of my coworkers pay $120+/month for downtown garage parking."

I mean, it is already here.  Just curious."
madisonwi,3c6y6y,StarPower1,3,Sat Jul 11 23:33:32 2015 UTC,"If I spend time finding job postings, I will either need to post them every week / check to see if they are still up each week.   The monthly thread is just a much better format for job searching. Selling / buying / roommate searches are great and quick, but job searching tends to be a long road that needs a more serious / long term home.   No one looking for a job wants to check each week for a new listing or two when they could get a ton of listings all at once from a monthly post.   Also i would bet, if we mathed it out, that the job postings have gone down since the removal of the monthly thread."

I am hoping someone in Madison might be willing to let me borrow or rent their system for a few weeks. I can pay in beer (homebrew that is decent enough or something off the shelf), grilling meat, game trade, or a small amount of cash.

Requirements: The house must be non-smoking and have off street parking, inside of a reasonably quite neighborhood. I don't care where you're at on the male/female spectrum, though I would prefer to find a roommate who is at least 24 years old.   A bit about me: I'm 26, male, I have a B.A. in Poli Sci, non-smoker, occasional drinker(2-3 times a month.) I'm very nerdy and work a lot. Once I'm in Madison I'll most likely be either working, at the closest game shop, or sleeping; though I may pick up discgolf and cycling.

Apparently it took ABTF months to get an admin to respond to ban just one person who was continually sending vile and harassing messages to users there, and it took a ton of documentation. BBP gets its own share of creepers and stupid FPHs, and users are often distraught to find out that mods are essentially powerless to help them. The admins are not responsive and I don't consider them as a resource or avenue for assistance.  It must be annoying to be an admin when your user base acts like unruly uneducated children. But it seems like reddit lost their main community liaison, which is really unfortunate for maintaining goodwill over the divide between admins and mods and users.

Not entirely faked but serious critical questions get deleted while bullshit propaganda tripe gets up voted and answered. We're being sold the propaganda at the price of our user data. Now, I think public data could be used to benefit us all. The problem is the data isn't kept public, they censor it at will, and those who own the data are of the same corporate capitalist mindset that's killed more people and ruined more ecosystems than any ideology that's gone before it.  So. Fuck y'all acting like this is a big suprise. The general strike is honestly pretty cool if genuine. If only we could organize a global strike across all borders and services we could send ALL the top fucks a message that WE PLEBS RUN THIS SHOW, So y'all better toe our line.  Tho, if the strike is a farce, all my faith is gone.

madisonwi,3bxvbm,lucentcb,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:54:45 2015 UTC,"I think it's a pretty reasonable request, especially since there seems to be a mod-specific subreddit admins can use to talk directly to mods.  All they had to do was put up a message letting everyone know that Victoria was being let go and that they weren't able to discuss the reasons because it's a private matter, then acknowledge that it was going to upset upcoming AMAs and that they'd let the community know as soon as they had a cleanup plan.  So I agree with them that the admins fucked up.  But that doesn't change the fact that we have no idea what really happened with Victoria, and once again Reddit is turning to speculation and making their protest look more like a tantrum than a show of solidarity."

We need an avenue to get out what happening in Wisconsin because Walker is setting his sights on the presidency and destroying the country as a whole. Reddit is helping to get this story out there. And shine a light on good things happening in Wisconsin; Russ Feingold running for Senate and giving Bernie Sanders an over whelming show of support.

madisonwi,3bxvbm,layer555,-3,Fri Jul 3 19:26:09 2015 UTC,Censorship is a slippery slope.
madisonwi,3bxvbm,Dizzy_Slip,7,Fri Jul 3 03:04:01 2015 UTC,Reddit is a privately owned forum. It isn't censorship if they own it.
madisonwi,3bxvbm,layer555,2,Fri Jul 3 06:52:00 2015 UTC,Sure but that doesn't change the fact that a site that used to focused on open discussion has now taken it upon itself to decide what is and isn't okay. If that's not censorship I don't know what is.
madisonwi,3bxvbm,Dysnomi,-2,Fri Jul 3 17:24:53 2015 UTC,Explain that logic to me. Can McDonald's ban free speech within McDonald's? Stuff like this is why I'm an anarchist.

And they have hauled in a decent assortment of older items including comics, toys and statues.    It is kind of lacking in personality at this point, it looks like something you might throw together on a convention floor.  But I'm guessing that will change as time goes on.    There's nothing there that would make me stop going to Westfield instead.  (Their Willy Street location is just too convenient for me.)  But it should be worth stopping in occasionally to see any new stuff has shown up."

I'm not a comic person, though I had a manga phase when I was a kid (they have none, in case anyone was wondering).  It's surprisingly big and it seems like they'll have everything if you're into classic American comics (old and new - the entire middle of the store are boxes upon boxes of old comics).  They had lots of newer graphic novel type stuff, and newer comics like The Walking Dead, etc.  It was interesting.  They also have some figurines but not a lot, it's mostly comics."

Not discounting the shop you're talking about at all, but if you're just looking for a good lcs, Westfield is where it's at.  They have a pull list for me, knew me by name my second time in there, and everything I'm looking for that isn't there they have within a week. And they call me to let me know so."
madisonwi,3bws1g,howmanyarethere,3,Fri Jul 3 04:49:40 2015 UTC,"I appreciate this.  Admittedly I'm out of the comic loop for the most part, but have a tender spot for comic shops because it reminds me of that awkward time in my life when I was a disgusting prepubescent nerd that found distraction from my ennui in the aisles of a comic book shop.   I saw this new shop opening and because it's really close to my house, I thought I would check it out. I have no bones with Westfield and frankly forgot about their shop on Willy Street because I'm a filthy casual.  Your endorsement of Westfield is totally valid and it's good to hear you have had excellent experiences there. I've always enjoyed going into their shops too. I just thought I'd mention this new shop because I have a personal opinion that the world is better with more shops.  What do you read these days? Any recommendations?"
madisonwi,3bws1g,cfrutiger,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:34:18 2015 UTC,"kind of a loaded questions. Marvel has a new Secret Wars running right now, and DC is doing a Convergence.    I'm more of a Marvel guy myself so I've been picking up most of the Secret War books that are coming out.  Also been a deadpool fan for years so grabbing his issues in those too.  Outside of Marvel/DC type stuff, Saga has been really big and comes highly recommended.   It's like Star Wars meets Romeo & Juliet (the one with leonado dicaprio),  but with a little more vulgarity/violence. Thats all i'm really reading right now.. but with secret wars coming out with like 4 books a week, its more than enough."

In any case, +2C is what the IPCC is ostensibly trying to address while +1C is already far too much (current is +0.86C) and we can apparently keep it under +1C by the year 2100, but only just. Hope they don't keep trying to address the issue with a cap and trade plan though... it just doesn't work."
madisonwi,3btn2e,MrRaoulDuke,4,Thu Jul 2 15:39:38 2015 UTC,"Great speech, lacking in the pie in the sky promises of other rallies. He did a great job laying out his platform, his proposed solutions and where his priorities lie. The only thing I felt was pandering was the portion on rescinding the citizens united case, which he had an achievable solution but the issue felt to me like a progressive beating a dead horse."
madisonwi,3btn2e,dmgb,5,Thu Jul 2 02:26:36 2015 UTC,But citizens united is probably the most important issue we as a country need to change. Give the power back to the people. Make it about dedication and passion - not who has the biggest bank account.
madisonwi,3btn2e,MrRaoulDuke,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:55:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it wouldn't be preferable to have the ruling reversed, I just don't see it happening any time soon given A) the priority placed on it by the average citizen, B) the strong unlikely hood of SCOTUS to take up another challenge to the same ruling less than 30 years from when a case was decided. The may limit some parts of campaign finance while upholding the ruling but a full out reversal historically takes the court a generation or 2. Finally C) even if Bernie gets to nominate 2 justices as president, he will have to be replacing Kennedy and scalia, maybe Thomas. Alito and Roberts are too young to be expected to die or retire in the next 8 years and replacing any other member is filling in a vote you already have in your favor."
madisonwi,3btn2e,dmgb,0,Thu Jul 2 14:06:13 2015 UTC,"A lot of this country's issues sadly aren't short term fixes, I agree with you there. But as long as we elect people that keep up with similar platforms making these key issues, more people will become aware and fight for it. Revolution doesn't happen over night. It takes a lot of time and a lot of participation."
madisonwi,3btn2e,MrRaoulDuke,0,Thu Jul 2 14:16:07 2015 UTC,"Revolution frequently happens overnight, usually at the end of a gun. What we're talking about, committed progressive reform of our democratic experiment does require commitment. Something about winning hearts and minds. Anyhow, joking aside, I think we can both agree that the fight for an equitable society requires an educated, politically vocal population and politicians who don't come from a ruling class and who run their agencies and branches of government effectively and openly."

Nearly every point he brought up was couple with some statement to the effect of ""I'll make it happen"", ""I'll force it through.""  Unfortunately the presidency doesn't work like that.  It just wasn't as cheesy or pronounced as other candidates but it was definitely there."
madisonwi,3btn2e,MrRaoulDuke,0,Fri Jul 3 15:20:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that was a bad thing. One of the reasons I was turned off of both president Obama's 2008 campaign and Rep. Ron Paul's was that they made promises that they had no way of keeping without action from the other branches of government which they have only limited control. I enjoyed that Bernie did speak about how he would address specific issues, and in the case of repealing Citizens United, made promises limited to the scope of the office he is seeking."
madisonwi,3btn2e,Mswindupbird89,0,Fri Jul 3 16:19:24 2015 UTC,"That was really the only instance, from what I recall, where he made a campaign promise with a game plan.  Everything else had none.  I'm necessarily disappointed about that.  All politicians make those, and events like this are meant to lay out a platform, not necessarily go in depth about how he plans to do things."

madisonwi,3bspm6,jherritz,2,Wed Jul 1 20:58:14 2015 UTC,"Very cool article, but they missed a few very important points regarding the clarity of water in our lakes, and the reason for algae.   Clarity:  yes, the water used to be more clear, but the lakes were very weedy.  If you look at postcards from the early 1900s, or read descriptions, the lakes had massive amounts of weeds, probably more so than today.  The algae in the water prevents light from penetrating deeper into the lake, which kind of reduces the amount of weeds growing if you think about it. Algae:  Yes, the fertilizers and chemical runoff from agriculture is a huge problem, but what people are not talking about is the power plant.  The power plant on East Wash.  That powerplant uses water from Lake Monona for cooling and temperature regulation.  This is why, in the winter, the ice is always thin near it.  It is keeping a warm body of water in that area, and that warm area of water is basically keeping a moderately sized bloom of algae alive, all winter.   When it warms up in the spring, the moderately sized bloom quickly grows into a huge amount of algae.  I'm not really sure what can be done about this, but prior to that power plant, the algae population dropped a lot lower, during winter months."

We were on a first-name basis with a lot of the long-term tenants and most of the staff. We never felt unsafe, and Tyler (the manager) and the rest of the staff are awesome and would take special pains to make us feel at home; Tyler even made us homemade spaghetti sauce!  The kitchens in each suite are pretty basic, but we were able to make the majority of our meals there. The bed was comfy.

The Road Star Inn is one of the cheapest hotels in Madison, and their weeknight rate is $65/night, weekend $70.  You probably could get a discounted rate for a weekly rate but 7 nights is still likely to be more than your $250/week.

I would like to read more about it, because like /u/Hosko817 I'm also very turned off by direct contact. Sales people and religious proselytizers are the worst, but politicians and people working for them can also be annoying.    However, I also care quite a bit about politics and have been involved in get-out-the-vote initiatives before.  I've worried that I might have made it worse rather than actually helping the candidate for which I was volunteering."
madisonwi,3bnejk,IDreamOfRedditing,5,Wed Jul 1 01:37:35 2015 UTC,"Okay, so for GOTV, here's what I could find of the AI's results. The rest were during a presentation from a campaign expert, and QA session. You'll see on the link it says canvass is 7% (but that's before things like the household spillover effect + stacking certain elements of the script which make people more likely to vote.)  Here's a NYT write up of the effect of direct voter contact (there are more studies, but this is a particularly concise writeup of one of the early ones):   As the 1998 elections approached, Gerber and Green partnered with the League of Women Voters to split 30,000 New Haven voters into four groups. Some received an oversize postcard encouraging them to vote, others the same message via a phone call or in-person visit. One control group received no contact whatsoever. After the election, Gerber and Green examined Connecticut records to see who actually voted. The in-person canvass yielded turnout 9.8 percent higher than for voters who were not contacted.    There are quite a few things that don't work (see first link), and add to that list ""visibility"" events (i.e., Honk and Waves, the Overnight Light Brigade, etc) which have no effect. Rallies also do not correlate with an increase in likelihood to vote. Nor do yard signs outside of hyper-local races where no one has any name recognition (school board in a town of 10,000 residents, sheriff, etc.)  Beyond GOTV, there's a fair amount of research on what makes direct voter contact persuasive to undecided voters (visits from people in their reference group or anticipated reference group are effective, sending long haired-college students to factory towns like McGovern did -- not so much.)   tl;dr, Campaigns raise and spend a lot of money, some of it in monumentally stupid ways (usually on ads at the end.) But direct voter contact, done properly, is not one of those areas."
madisonwi,3bnejk,doxiegrl1,3,Wed Jul 1 02:55:56 2015 UTC,Hopefully not the retracted LaCour and Green Science paper.
madisonwi,3bnejk,IDreamOfRedditing,0,Wed Jul 1 05:22:56 2015 UTC,"Nope. But the only reason they were able to get away with that bullshit for as long as they were was because the field had more or less agreed that voters were persuadable. The reason they got caught was because of how much of an outlier their results were (even given the persuadability of voters), which was what gave a lot of people reason to look at the underlying canvass data (which was really lazily faked.)  EDIT: I love how I'm getting down votes for summarizing the abstract of this paper which was what got the study retracted, and for correctly calling the 'study' conducted by LaCour and Green 'bullshit.' Which, you know, is what it was. Oh, /r/madisonwi, never change."

madisonwi,3bn90l,powahwork,14,Tue Jun 30 16:10:31 2015 UTC,How about they start ticketing for failure to use indicators and reckless driving? I'd love to see some of the people that are swerving between lanes with no indicators on get pulled over for it. Guess its more difficult when I've seen nearly as many police vehicles doing it as well....

madisonwi,3bn90l,vatoniolo,9,Tue Jun 30 16:15:21 2015 UTC,"The problem with this operation is how they execute it. I've seen this sting before -- the guy in front of me got pulled over and it was bullshit. The plain clothes cop didn't even look like he was going to cross. Standing on the curb, not facing towards the road, just hanging out. I'm pretty sure the car even slowed down and proceeded because it was obvious the guy had no intention of crossing.  These cops need to at least cross the road. That one guy standing still is making the city like 5 grand an hour."
madisonwi,3bn90l,new-money,5,Tue Jun 30 19:26:25 2015 UTC,Every time I have saw this it was insanely obvious the pedestrian is trying to cross the street. The pedestrian has always had a neon shirt and the crosswalk was marked with construction cones.

That's a bit much."
madisonwi,3bn90l,n609mike,9,Tue Jun 30 17:18:04 2015 UTC,Its also the law to stop like that and even more dangerous for pedestrians when you don't. If the cars closest to the pedestrian stop and the ones further away don't the cars behind them wont be able to see why those cars stop and being typical drivers accelerate and go around them. $350 is way less money than if they had hit a pedestrian.

In court they lowered it to $200 and changed the charge to an illegal left turn, even though she wasn't turning..."
madisonwi,3bn90l,588-2300_empire,3,Tue Jun 30 16:30:32 2015 UTC,"Not disagreeing with enforcement of the law, but does anyone else think yielding to pedestrians is often stupid?  Here's a scenario that gets me all the time: Driving down Gorham late at night, not much car or pedestrian traffic. Typically a busy street that moves faster than your average neighborhood street. Stoplights every few blocks.  A guy standing at a crosswalk on one of the few blocks without a stoplight. I'm the only car on the road. By law, I have to come to a stop and let him pass. This feels weird for a few reasons:   Stopping on a busy street, not at a stoplight, feels unsafe for me. Inefficient use of time for both parties. The guy isn't going to cross until I stop anyways. It would be faster for me, and for him, to just drive through so he can cross after. Inefficient use of gas.   In this scenario, the guy most likely does not even want me to stop. He realizes he could walk a block down and have a stop light. He also realizes it will take longer to cross if he actually waits for me to stop. And he might even feel bad for making me stop. How often do you see this scenario where the pedestrian waits for the car to stop, then waves and hurries across the street with an awkward half-walk half-run waddle?  This is the scenario in which I often slow down, but don't yield. It's stupid that I have to feel guilty and risk getting a ticket for being conscious, safe, and efficient. Even during the day when there is more traffic, Gorham's stop lights tend to spread out the traffic so there are still opportunities to cross without a light. (Gorham is just an example, this scenario could occur on many streets)"
madisonwi,3bn90l,Dizzy_Slip,0,Tue Jun 30 19:36:25 2015 UTC,"If the pedestrian is near the crosswalk but on the curb, you do not have to and should not stop.  If the pedestrian has stepped off the curb into the street, then you must stop."

It always makes me a little sad when I hear folks who live around here complaining about cold weather. If you even make the slightest attempt to enjoy the winter--much less revel in it--you will be rewarded several times over.

I would say that the atmosphere is maybe a bit more like Eugene than Portland, except it's not as insanely liberal as Eugene. I mean, it's pretty liberal -- on par with Portland's liberalness, maybe -- but Eugene is a whole other reality.  If you have more questions, PM me. If you come out to visit or to stay, hit me up and I'll be happy to show you around town!  In no particular order:  PROS   Snow  More sun, less rain Cheese There are actually people here who aren't white, so it actually lives up to the kind of diversity that Oregon likes to pretend it has... This was actually an eye-opening experience for me when I moved here Similar microbrew culture... New Glarus, OMG NEW GLARUS Neat stuff to do and see... Madison has excellent food and music scenes, a few neat museums, State Street (which is unlike anything I encountered in Oregon), a free zoo, lakes, and a bunch of other stuff that I've always been too busy to actually go out and enjoy Thunderstorms... I've always loved them, so it is amazing to live in a place where they happen once a week in the summer, rather than once or twice all summer Fireflies are really, really cool   CONS   Snow Salted roads will rust your car like crazy Fucking AWFUL humidity and heat Mosquitos eat you alive every summer Scott Walker and other shitty conservative politics/politicians Inter-city transportation is not as good (public transit is better/worse depending on where in Oregon you're coming from and where in Madison you end up living).   Like I said, let me know if you have questions. As a native Oregonian who's spent several years getting to know Madison, I would be happy to give you a fair/balanced comparison."

I see very few non-white people around, especially at 'Madison-famous' events like the farmers market, compared to where I used to live. The most diverse place in Madison I've ever see in the Parkway. Oregon must be super white then.."
madisonwi,3bkv5u,bkv,3,Tue Jun 30 13:18:05 2015 UTC,"Oregon is exceptionally white. There is a large Hispanic population there but it is much more (unofficially) segregated in terms of where people live and work, because a lot of them are migrant workers.  I think there may be a similar segregation in Madison in terms of the areas people live and the events they attend, but I think it depends a lot on where you live and where you go. As a west/south Madison bus rider, I am sure I witness far more diversity on a daily basis than most people do."
madisonwi,3bkv5u,Bttc,5,Tue Jun 30 15:59:45 2015 UTC,I don't think it's fair to use things like the farmers market as a barometer for racial diversity.  Just because you live in non-diverse areas and attend non-diverse events doesn't mean there is little diversity.

Being a large college town there is a lot of nightlife with a ton of unique restaurants, and a lot of ethnic food for a city its size.

Here's my perspective:  Madison is tons of fun while you are in college.  Once you're out of college, it's a lot less fun.  The housing is really expensive, and the recent influx of highly paid Epic employees who desire to live downtown has caused rent to spike even higher.  Parking is pretty awful.  If you want to be an adult, and maybe have a decent car and nice digs, it's really expensive* to do here.   I don't feel like there are as many activities as there are in other cities, that don't involve sports.  *: compared to average salary of this area, obviously it is cheaper than large cities  I feel like Madison has cramped, expensive, student-ish housing with expensive parking or no parking at all, or boring, beige, affordable suburbs.   It completely lacks the moderately priced, hip neighborhoods for younger working professionals.  After living in Milwaukee, which has wonderful areas and communities like Bayview, Riverwest, and the East Side, I just...  I just can't say I enjoy Madison much anymore.   Milwaukee had everything Madison offered, but better food, better arts/galleries/events, better music, far far cheaper housing, and way more 'just out of college' communities."
madisonwi,3bkv5u,Visceralrealism,4,Tue Jun 30 18:34:53 2015 UTC,"It completely lacks the moderately priced, hip neighborhoods for younger working professionals.   Near east side?

madisonwi,3bkv5u,oregondirtfarmer,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:44:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, seriously. I love Milwaukee, and spend a fair amount of time there, but Madison definitely has places to live that are neither studenty nor beige. Atwood has been this way for years, and the south side is slowly becoming this.   But overall, I feel like you're judging Madison by another city's standards. 'Being an adult' in Madison doesnt' necessarily involve owning a car or having a spacious apartment. You are likely to get around by bike, and live in a small, old apartment. The positive side of that is that Madison is compact (unlike Milwaukee), safe (I am in no way an alarmist about crime, but every single one of my friends in Riverwest has been burgled in the past couple years), and has the benefits of a world-class university right downtown.   Tl;dr: Madison is its' own thing, jettison your ideas of 'what adults do' and you'll enjoy it."
madisonwi,3bkv5u,ScottWalkerSucks,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:14:18 2015 UTC,"Also, I feel like a lot of the 'OMG, Madison is expensive' attitude is fed by newbies who sign leases from afar, and thus tend to get the most expensive apartments on the market. You can certainly splurge, but there are actually a lot of cheap apartments here, you just have to look. I rent a 3-bedroom house in a nice part of the Isthmus for $1150, which is very comparable to Milwaukee prices as far as I can tell."

madisonwi,3binxy,new-money,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:55:11 2015 UTC,"Well, the problem is amplified because they close the two primary boat launches on Lake Monona; Olbrich and Olin.  Apparently they do this so they can launch all the police boats, but it really fucks everyone else over.  On top of that, Lottes Park is still closed."
madisonwi,3binxy,n609mike,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:15:22 2015 UTC,"I really think keeping Olin OR Olbrich open would alleviate a lot of these issues.  By closing BOTH of them, it forced basically all the traffic to go through the river.  I don't understand the reasoning in closing both of them."

madisonwi,3bfgul,bigmanpigman,9,Sun Jun 28 19:25:22 2015 UTC,"Lots of good recommendations, and I'll try to fill around the edges:    The Malt House should be expanded upon - piles of great beer, but no food. There are menus from delivery places in a bin there, or you can bring your own food.  Brasserie V was mentioned, but not elaborated on. Bring your wallet, but expect some decent French/Belgian food, and an amazing selection of beers, including a lot of hard-to-get European imports. Often they have 4-5 beers from a single small brewery on tap, from Finland, Norway, etc. ~$8 for a beer, but hard to get many without going to the brewery - I've seen exchange students see beers they had a hard time finding back home, for what it's worth.  If you're not up for Brasserie V's food, Pizza Bruta on that block is a must-stop. Hand-tossed, wood fired pizzas with local ingredients. Don't balk at the price - totally worth it. They usually have 1-2 good microbrews on tap.  Since I've just steered you to two expensive places, how about a free one? Head two blocks down Garfield and you'll find the zoo. It's free, and pretty good for the price. Worth spending an hour walking around it.  At the other end of Monroe from the Stadium is the Arboretum, and that's also 1000 acres of free walking.   Ok, back to places to visit:    Great Dane is ok, but I find the seasonals to be better than most of their year-round brews. Good food at decent prices, and the downtown one has a nice beer garden to sit in.  Surprisingly, Jordan's Big 10 Pub on Regent has pretty good food, and often some interesting beers on tap. Their happy hour is great.  Both Graze and The Library tend to have a handful of decent beers on tap, along with decent food.  The Cooper's Tavern on the Capital Square has a decent tap list, and some upscale pub food.  The Old Fashioned on the Capital Square has an extensive beer list, and is a Madison staple. Try the cheese curds.    Middleton   Craftsman Table and Tap often has some great beers on tap, and some good food. I think they have the best cheese curds in town. The Freehouse Pub often has some great WI beers on tap, and good food, although not really a dinner spot.   Maybe worth visiting   Sprecher's exists. I'm not a big fan of most of their beer, but if you've got the time and need another place to try, go for it.  Granite City Brewery - an Iowa (?) based chain, they don't really brew, at least to my mind. The wort is made in a central location, and then shipped to the chains, thus avoiding any taxes and paperwork for shipping alcohol across state lines. Then the ""brewers"" pitch yeast, ferment, and put the beers on tap. I've never loved their beer, but their food is generally good.  Gray's Tied House down in Verona was an utter disappointment to me. I have nothing positive to say about food or beer there.  Blue Moon on Old University - always changing tap list, but often some decent brews. (Go to Lombardinos across the street for a terrible beer selection but amazing, locally-sourced Italian food.) Oliver's Public House on Old University - brand new, and still working out the kinks, but I think it will be great as time goes on. Flying Hound near Verona - same owners as the Freehouse Pub in Middleton, and like Oliver's, new enough that they haven't really seemed to settle in yet.    Last but not least, drive up to Central Waters. Just do it. I do it every 6 months or so, and I always kick myself for not doing it more often.   Good luck!"
madisonwi,3bfgul,internet_sage,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:42:34 2015 UTC,"damn, that is an awesome list! thanks a lot for the detailed writeup!   I definitely have to agree with you about craftsmans cheese curds, those were amazing. I'll have to go back for the beers as the one time I was there was a work lunch so I couldn't drink."
madisonwi,3bfgul,doxiegrl1,16,Sun Jun 28 22:55:29 2015 UTC,"Karben4 consistently makes the best beer in town.  Fantasy factory is a favorite.    Boss meadery for mead.   Tyranena is worth the trip. If you're willing to put in a longer drive,  central waters, OSo, and Red eye brewpub are fantastic and close to each other.   Brasserie V is a great Belgian bar/restaurant.  Malthouse,  Dexters, and Mason Lounge are other great bars.   Mobcraft and house of brews are co located in the Monona area.   I'm not fond of Capital or Wisconsin Brewing Company."
madisonwi,3bfgul,Picklethis2,3,Sun Jun 28 20:04:18 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed capital, but I think that had more to do with the live music and the fact that someone else was paying.   I'm excited for the meadery! thanks for the tips!"

It's a wit with ginger and it's really unique.  I don't think the food at Vintage is quite as good as their beers though so I'll often look for Vintage's beers at other places like the Old Fashioned.  The Union had Jinja Ninja on tap last week too.    If you get outside of town, take a trip out to Potosi.  Their Tangerine IPA is good and they have a little museum to go to."

Umami used to serve the egg tamago-style, but I think the switch to fried egg is probably to save time and effort.  The delicious pork belly remains the same.

But if there is one piece of advice I could give anyone who wants to refinish a basement, it would be to make sure that your plans include preparations for it to flood.  I don't care how dry you think the basement is, or how long you have been in the house and never seen a drop of moisture in it, a basement is still a hole in the ground and the lowest point in your house.  Sooner or later, water is going to find its way in there.  If not from outside, then from plumbing leaks within the house.  If your renovation plans take this into account, you can save yourself a lot of headache as well as thousands (if not tens of thousands) of dollars when it inevitably gets wet."

What results do we want?   The monthly jobs thread was actually really good   Jobs threads came every month at most, but since they were not automated, they were inconsistent and could happen 2 or 3 months apart.  Also, there's a tendency for more job opportunities to crop up on a month's time (or 2 or 3) as opposed to a week.  And the less frequent the opportunity, the more noticeable it is.   and now you've basically killed it.   I thought it was the community's prerogative to post about jobs, not the mods.  We're not going to scour all of indeed and craigslist just to post a wall of jobs here that don't pertain to us.  Actual job seekers and those that hear about openings at their own places of work can post all of those.   The two Subreddits you've listed for jobs are pretty much shit.   It's up to every individual whether or not they want to utilize a particular sub.  They're only ""shit"" because not a lot of people use them, mostly because not a lot of people know about them.  And as was mentioned in the post, any jobs posted here are encouraged to be posted to those other places, as well, but it's certainly not a requirement.   No one wants to come to a thread and have people discussing very different topics and ideas.   It's not a discussion.  People are meant to come here to share information that can be helpful to others, or to meet others on an individual basis.  Anything that needs discussion that doesn't need to be known by the whole community can be shared via PM and is encouraged.   You're desire to ""avoid clutter"" is ultimately causing redditors who would post, not to.   I'd like to see your research on this.   Life isn't organized like this.    People can organize their lives however they want.  Mods can organize their subs however they want.  The communities of those subs can offer suggestions freely and we mods will pay attention.  Thing is, we can't make sweeping decisions over a vary small vocal minority.  Usually when a topic on subreddit structure becomes active, most people are either on board with change or really don't mind either way.  Also, this post is 2 hours old.  Give it some time."

I'll be moving to Madison at the end of January when my current lease is up and am looking to either rent a room or find a roommate. Doing some research on Madison I'd like to find something on the Near East Side, though I'm not to picky, as long as it isn't a college zone, or out in the suburbs/sticks. My budget is roughly 600-750 per month including utilities and internet(not that interested in cable/satellite/tv but will split it). From what research I've done I can probably get a studio or 1-bedroom most places for about that price, so I think it's reasonable.   Requirements: The house must be non-smoking and have off street parking, inside of a reasonably quite neighborhood. I love my sleep, and I hate having it interrupted by a party in the apartment upstairs(though if you want to throw one, warn me beforehand and I'll clear out for the night if I'm not invited). I don't care where you're at on the male/female spectrum, though I would prefer to find a roommate who is at least 25 years old.   A bit about me: I'm 26, male, I have a B.A. in Poli Sci, non-smoker, occasional drinker(2-3 times a month), 420 friendly but I don't imbibe myself. I'm very nerdy and work a lot. I'm a work hard, play hard, sleep hard, kind of person. Right now I'm working 70 hours a week, I play board games on Tuesday night, table top war games on Saturday morning, and will sleep at least 16 hours on Sunday. Once I'm in Madison I'll most likely be either working, at the closest game shop, or sleeping; though I may pick up discgolf and cycling. I don't have any pets, and am fine with any pets you may have, other than ferrets, birds and reptiles.   If you think you'll have a room I can fill, shoot me a PM or reply to this post and we can talk."

You can also take the Southwest Commuter Trail most of the way down south to a town called Paoli, though I hop on some roads the last few miles to get there.

The only downside is that a lot of people don't seem to look at the full description much, or have a very liberal way of interpreting styles and genres. While listing genres is nice, I'd suggest having a few example links of what sound you're looking for, or better yet recording a short demo on your home computer to provide.

Which is entirely correct, and entirely within the scope of today's decision.   Conservatives love to paint this issue as an attack on religion.  Except, nobody is forcing churches to perform same sex marriages.  Churches are free to work within the scope of what they feel is appropriate for their religion.  They can exclude people from ceremonies, lead worships, and preach what they feel is right.  The cost of that freedom is a firewall that restricts the church's influence into government.   In other words, churches are free to continue not performing same sex marriages.  The legal benefits that come with marriage are granted by the government.  It's a legal contract entered between two consenting adults whose religion plays no part.  The government bound by the Constitution to extend those benefits to any and all people, and cannot arbitrarily decide who can and can't be granted these benefits.    So, with all due respect to Mr. Walker, get bent.  Your rights are not being infringed."
madisonwi,3b8asb,countrykev,11,Fri Jun 26 21:31:16 2015 UTC,"Except, nobody is forcing churches to perform same sex marriages.   In fact, there's a whole passage in the damn opinion (PDF) where they state this explicitly:   Finally, it must be emphasized that religions, and those who adhere to religious doctrines, may continue to advocate with utmost, sincere conviction that, by divine precepts, same-sex marriage should not be condoned. The First Amendment ensures that religious organizations and persons are given proper protection as they seek to teach the principles that are so fulfilling and so central to their lives and faiths, and to their own deep aspirations to continue the family structure they have long revered. The same is true of those who oppose same-sex marriage for other reasons. In turn, those who believe allowing samesex marriage is proper or indeed essential, whether as a matter of religious conviction or secular belief, may engage those who disagree with their view in an open and searching debate. The Constitution, however, does not permit the State to bar same-sex couples from marriage on the same terms as accorded to couples of the opposite sex."

He was stating that he was protecting people from having this decision forced upon people who have religious beliefs that collide. How does this even affect anyone who doesn't support it? God damn the gays for getting the right to marry! Yet people violate the sanctity of marriage by committing adultery, and divorcing. But heaven forbid we allow same sex marriages to legalize their love.   There are enough forward thinkers in the country that if you aren't comfortable with this ruling for whatever reason, you can not involve yourself in things related to it. Don't want to see gay marriage? Don't go to gay weddings, don't be the officiant at one. Plenty of other people could fill your spot.  Don't be friends with gays.   Funny though, Scott Walker thinks it's perfectly fine for a woman to have to bring a child into this world that she did not choose to have (rape) because of some peoples' and his own religious beliefs. So now we have a child coming into this world who could potentially live a really fucked up life (insert scenario where this kid isn't loved, maybe this kid is given up for adoption).

It is ASTOUNDING to me that something with so much public support could still be such a polarizing social issue.
madisonwi,3b8asb,IWantToBeAProducer,3,Fri Jun 26 22:17:11 2015 UTC,"Sooo I have a question. As someone who has not married yet, when a priest or whomever becomes qualified to perform marriages, does he/she get this qualification from the government? If so, people like this can sod off because it's obviously a government issue and has nothing to do with religion and is in no way restricting your way of practicing religion.

madisonwi,3b2qzy,MSACCESS4EVA,6,Thu Jun 25 14:26:51 2015 UTC,"I hadn't been in there for a while, but took my Dad during March Madness. The burgers were super high priced - I think it was like 13+ for a burger? Apparently they had a new menu. One of the TVs was half-broken, and the staff seemed like they were completely checked out. I just got the feeling like no one there was trying anymore.    The place was still pretty full though. I'm surprised they racked up 100k in debt during the bridge construction. Tony Franks was a long-standing psuedo-tradition for dives in Madison, but it seems like they had the wind knocked out of their sails a few years ago."
madisonwi,3b2qzy,Alarchy,4,Thu Jun 25 20:46:39 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately this closely describes my recent experience there. I wasn't worried about the service, but the burgers were just not worth what we paid."

madisonwi,3b3hyy,kristephe,15,Thu Jun 25 17:46:40 2015 UTC,Usually July/August can get pretty humid and sweaty without A/C but it's mostly tolerable other than that.
madisonwi,3b3hyy,vicarious_c,7,Thu Jun 25 18:00:22 2015 UTC,You'll want A/C for the humid days. See if they'll let you put a window unit in the bedroom and that would be enough.
madisonwi,3b3hyy,TomTheGeek,7,Thu Jun 25 18:34:26 2015 UTC,"This was my thought as well. It does get uncomfortably hot for sleeping, but you can probably manage with fans the rest of the time. The amount of shade and hot quickly the house cools off is a big factor as well."
madisonwi,3b3hyy,manatee313,3,Thu Jun 25 19:07:17 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks! Yeah, it's a tough call between the other things we're hoping for in a rental. We have cats, 6 bicycles, homebrew equipment and a car and since we're not used to the winter weather, figured a garage might make the adjustment a little easier as well as the extra space. The owner did mention people putting a window unit in the bedroom and that being sufficient. Our cats like it warm anyways so they'd probably ditch us when we cooled the bedroom. :) I'm thinking about asking if they'd include a window unit but see plenty on Craigslist for $50-100 so might be no big deal or maybe the current tenants will leave theirs! :) Thanks for the insight! d"
madisonwi,3b3hyy,doxiegrl1,3,Thu Jun 25 20:05:49 2015 UTC,"I'm from Atlanta.  A window unit is sufficient up here. Look for a place that will allow good airflow through open windows.  We put box fans in the windows and cool our place off at night.  It works great as long as the lows are below 70, and they usually are."
madisonwi,3b3hyy,doxiegrl1,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:38:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Now to just learn to acclimate to the winter. I'm mentally ready for it, my body is just going to be very surprised. Hoping to find somewhere with a garage to make the transition a little easier though we've found a nice place to hopefully rent that would mean we didn't have to commute via car on the weekdays which I fear would make a weekend adventure even more work to dig the car out from the winter . :)"
madisonwi,3b3hyy,doxiegrl1,3,Thu Jun 25 22:40:07 2015 UTC,"A driveway or lot will be fine. We don't get a ton of snow because we are west of the Great Lakes. Street parking is a hassle because you have to move your car from side to side (alternate side parking), and the plows can make some heavy snow banks. Definitely remove the snow from your drive/car ASAP because it's easier to remove powder than snow with a crust on it. (Make sure to buy on of the long ice scrapers with a brush).   The city requires you to shovel your sidewalk in a timely manner after a snowfall.  That's easier to do before too many people have walked on it.  Plan where you'll put the snow so you don't have super tall snow banks in the most convenient spots. You want to spread out the snow.   Winter is cold, but try to embrace it. If you wear warm enough clothes, you can feel like a badass."
madisonwi,3b3hyy,doxiegrl1,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:34:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks! The winter advice is much appreciated!! Yeah, we try to embrace whatever it's like. In Houston, sweating is a part of life most of the year and we try to not let it stop us from being active and we're planning to keep biking in the winter. You're definitely right, it's all about being prepared for the weather. In Houston, people are so cold when we do get chilly snaps because they're so rare people try to just throw on a hoodie and stay warm. :)"
madisonwi,3b3hyy,v-porphyria,2,Fri Jun 26 01:52:36 2015 UTC,"I don't bike in winter.  You need a whole other set of winter clothes to make that work out.  Things I've seen to make it more bearable.   -warm but thin caps for under you helmet  -foam ""outer mittens"" that you attach to your handlebars for the season.  You put your mittened hands inside these.  (The wind is killer on your hands).   -snow tires  -goggles because your eyeballs will freeze off.   -balaclavas"
madisonwi,3b3hyy,colusaboy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:26:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yep, had to Google balaclavas though the word was familiar, haha. We bmx too so my husband is planning on definitely wearing his full face helmet with goggles. Our top pick of a rental house is only 1.2 miles from campus though so walking looks like a definite winter option as well. Thank you again, it's helpful! Coming from the west coast then living in Houston, our contact with people who are used to living in colder winters are limited to a handful of folks who went to undergrad or grad schools in those areas."
madisonwi,3b3hyy,colusaboy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:51:00 2015 UTC,Yeah I live 1.3 mi from campus.  I bike summer through fall until the first salt and start again in the spring once salt has been cleared from the roads by rain/street sweepers.  I try not to bike after they've laid down salt.  A lot of winter bikers keep a junk winter bike so that their good bike doesn't get rusted to hell.
madisonwi,3b3hyy,doxiegrl1,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:35:30 2015 UTC,"Parking is pretty much non-existent on campus. Sometimes people are able to buy an expensive permit, but it isn't something to plan on. I suggest planning on taking the bus, walking or biking."
madisonwi,3b3hyy,paulwesterberg,2,Fri Jun 26 03:21:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd seen that mentioned online. We're used to that at his school but not where I work at another university so it fits with our current lifestyle of biking in to work usually. Thanks!"
madisonwi,3b3hyy,alxdy0y0,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:28:45 2015 UTC,A window unit is all you're gonna need after Houston.   I have one in my bedroom cuz I need it cool to sleep.  Winter is coming.
madisonwi,3b3hyy,drunkenAmoeba,2,Fri Jun 26 12:57:21 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah, we do like it cool to sleep but I'm wondering if we may get by without it this first time since it'll be later in the summer and then get one next summer. Mentally preparing for winter! I'm excited for the adventure, it sounds like a beautiful city."

madisonwi,3b3hyy,madtownWI,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:45:57 2015 UTC,It's best to buy a unit off Craigslist at the end of summer.
madisonwi,3b3hyy,name_with_a_y,7,Sat Jun 27 03:26:46 2015 UTC,It depends on how well insulated the house is. My house has good insulation and an efficient dehumidifier that I use to keep the humidity down. So I rarely need to run the AC during the summer.  But 3 years ago we had a brutally hot summer where temps were 100+ for a week.
madisonwi,3b3hyy,n609mike,3,Thu Jun 25 20:36:26 2015 UTC,i remember that summer
madisonwi,3b3hyy,doxiegrl1,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:00:22 2015 UTC,"That was my first year in an apartment without AC... Showers felt pointless because I'd step out and immediately start sweating. It's funny, after that summer I swore I'd never live here without AC again but the last few years have all been pretty mild."
madisonwi,3b3hyy,Casus125,6,Fri Jun 26 13:49:53 2015 UTC,"Plenty of people live here without AC and survive just fine. I haven't had AC in five years. There are a few nights every summer where it's difficult to sleep, but I'm sure it's nowhere near as bad as Houston."
madisonwi,3b3hyy,MrRaoulDuke,4,Thu Jun 25 19:17:45 2015 UTC,You'll be much more comfortable with one.
madisonwi,3b3hyy,Mousybj,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:02:47 2015 UTC,I agree...visited on Sun/Mon. We don't like sleeping in humidity and found a place with central air so it should be good!
madisonwi,3b3hyy,RoseStillHasThorns,3,Wed Jul 1 13:52:39 2015 UTC,"Yea, you'll be fine.  I'm from Florida and I hardly turn on the air unless I have people over. A fan and an ice pack in my bed when I'm sleeping keeps me cool enough."
madisonwi,3b3hyy,RoseStillHasThorns,3,Thu Jun 25 19:22:40 2015 UTC,You can get a decent window AC toward the end of summer for like $50 on craigslist. They take like 5 minutes to install.
madisonwi,3b3hyy,Captain_Sabatini,2,Thu Jun 25 20:07:14 2015 UTC,"Don't leave the unit in for winter unless you want to waste a lot of money.  Also, if you rent a draft place like mine, there is this window wrap stuff to put over your windows."
madisonwi,3b3hyy,maccuser,5,Thu Jun 25 22:09:03 2015 UTC,"Nah, it cools off well enough at night.  A few fans to circulate the air and it's not terrible.  August might be a bit rough, but not unbearable."
madisonwi,3b3hyy,likecatnipforpeople,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:58:42 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It gets hot and humid some days, but it cools off at night and is not going to be nearly as hot as what you dealt with in Houston. A good fan to circulate air in your bedroom will be enough to handle the hotter nights"
madisonwi,3b3hyy,gradi3nt,2,Thu Jun 25 18:02:24 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the amount of shade your house gets. We live in a 10 year old subdivision and the sun beats on the house. On days that its humid and there's isn't a breeze, it gets a little unbearable, and I like it warm. Just make sure the cats have somewhere cool to escape to. One room with a window unit is doable for awhile. Welcome to Madison btw!"
madisonwi,3b3hyy,mad_jer,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:12:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you! We're really excited about it. We'd hoped to go back to the NW but Madison sounds like a great place and it'll be a welcome change from Houston, though we have found plenty of reasons to enjoy living in Houston. (It's not ALL strip malls and freeways, just a lot of them.) My husband is willing to rent sight unseen and though the house we're most interested in looks good, I think I'm going to come up on Sunday to check a few places out. Thanks again!"
madisonwi,3b3hyy,mad_jer,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:39:01 2015 UTC,"Don't rent sight unseen. There are a lot of landlords that rent to college students, you want to make sure you're not getting swindled."
madisonwi,3b3hyy,mad_jer,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:23:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks...Yeah I decided to go last minute since we're already within 60 days and there didn't seem to be more properties coming up that fit what we want. Very glad I went. It was fun to see the city and I learned a lot about it from locals and by driving around and the properties I saw.  The property I thought I'd want the most turned out to be not as great and the landlord is not the friendliest guy and openly told me that he owned most or all of the block in two directions and put in the paperwork to have it all torn down so we might be the last people living there. My husband has at least a 2 yr position so I asked if he only wanted someone for a year and he said probably, but you never know with the city, haha. So thankfully I crossed that one off my list!"
madisonwi,3b3hyy,Sabinchen7,2,Tue Jun 30 13:48:29 2015 UTC,My favorite property living there was on the far west side owned by JSM properties. We only moved because we had kids and needed a bit more space. They may be worth a look!

There is a salad bar area that you can get up and go to that is really good, and then you also have this wooden rod on your table that is red on one side and green on the other. There are other servers constantly walking around the entire restaurant with all kinds of delicious meats and also this really good cinnamon pineapple thing. When you flip that wooden rod on your table to a certain color (I forget which specific color) the servers with all the meat will start coming up to your table and asking if you want whatever they have and then shaving some onto your plate.

madisonwi,3aw2gz,layer555,3,Wed Jun 24 01:44:28 2015 UTC,"Emphasize this point, low test scores are an indicator that something isn't working as intended but it might be something else.   For example in Wisconsin if enough students have a different native language there needs to be some teaching in there native language, or something like that not exactly sure how it works. My wife teaches primarily in Spanish in an immersion program with some native Spanish speakers and some native English speakers; in this program more instruction is in Spanish initially with the goal of all students being fluent in Spanish and English by fifth grade. However, testing has to be done in English. This means a bunch of kids are at a disadvantage when taking the tests and score lower even if they are smart and proficient in all areas they have been taught.  There are many other shortcomings for the mandatory testing, the point is the school might not be worse just because it has lower test scores.  Also, open enrollment is up to the school/district if they want to/have space to accept more students."

And the Tiki Bar at the East Side Businessman's Club.  In addition the new higher end Waypoint Public House is accessible by the Monona docks a hundred yards away but will have it's own docks in August. It's on the river north of the Beltline.   I'd consider both of these river places to be part of Lake Monona, as much as Mariner's Inn and Nautigal are part of Mendota up the yahara river a bit. But really only Captain Bill's and Edgewater are the only places with real lake views. The union docks are technically only for people with Union membership. There's like 2 temporary docks near Sardine but not exclusive to them, that's the closest thing on Monona itself.  Most of Lake Monona was surrounded by privately owned residences long before the northern parts of Lake Mendota were. Which is why all of the restaurants other than the Edgewater are in the far northern corners of the lake.   This is why I'm really in support of the boathouse proposal that Frank Lloyd Wright originally proposed to Madison in the 50's and never came through. The city could use public docks near Monona Terrace as a way to pull in more boaters from other cities and states to the lake. But the people who actually live on the lake want no part in putting more boats on the lake. They've shot down all kinds of proposals in the past and they are gearing up for fighting any significant proposals using the waterfront at the San Damiano Friary property that the church is selling on Monona Dr."

That and cheap drinks. :-)  East Side Club  Mickey's would be an easy walk from the banks  Schluter park has the ice cream place just across the street  Olin Park has the Great Taste and is otherwise a pretty good picnic spot"

Same with east side club.  Mickeys... what?  How would I get to that?  Schulter is viable, I guess.  Doesn't really feel like a restaurant worth going to though.  Olin Park?

madisonwi,3ariu7,FoobearsOnParade,2,Tue Jun 23 11:58:00 2015 UTC,"I came here thinking this list would be a list of people ordained through the Universal Life Church or the Church of Dude, which are actually religious, although I was mistaken.  The people listed above would actually do non-religious weddings.  At some point you're splitting hairs a bit.  A friend of ours married my wife and I, it was pretty painless for her to get ordained."

Those ceremonies are non-religious, and you can decide how involved (or not) you want the officiant to be - like, you could write up everything you want them to say and just have them show up, or they can provide some ideas based on how they typically do ceremonies."

madisonwi,3ariu7,shellsters,2,Tue Jun 23 01:49:48 2015 UTC,I attended a wedding where former mayoral candidate Scott Resnick was the officiant. He did a pretty good job.  FYI I can't read the actual text of your post because of the wonky formatting on this sub's header.

James and Connie are super easy to work with, too. They provide you with a lot of choices, religious and non-religious, and really allow you to make the ceremony your own!  My parents were really bummed when they heard we weren't getting married at a Catholic church, but after our wedding, they told us they thought everything turned out really well."
madisonwi,3ariu7,HippoCampus22,2,Tue Jun 23 14:23:15 2015 UTC,My recommendation: get a friend that you trust to get ordained (can be done online for free via the Universal Life Church). It makes the ceremony personal because someone you know and that knows you is doing the talking.  I say this because I became ordained 5 years ago and I've performed 11 weddings (12 and 13 already teed up). I only do it for friends and family and don't charge anything. It's a fun story for everyone involved.
madisonwi,3ariu7,puntspeedchunk,2,Tue Jun 23 15:00:09 2015 UTC,I think this is the best option.
madisonwi,3ariu7,omniraden,2,Wed Jun 24 13:48:17 2015 UTC,I have a friend that performs secular weddings on a regular  basis and does a wonderful job. Pm me and I'll give you his number.

Company.   We needed a ceremony we wanted, no religion and what not, bit also wanted a traditional sounding ceremony. The way she worded things was amazing. If you wanted to hear what she was saying as religious you did. If you didn't, there was no mention of God or the sort.  I cannot recommend Michelle enough."
madisonwi,3ariu7,thatgirlsthings,2,Tue Jun 23 02:09:56 2015 UTC,"A friend of ours got ordained as Secular Humanist and performed the ceremony for us. He's Canadian, so he got sponsored by a local humanist. In Wisconsin, I believe you can declare yourselves married, so officiant doesn't need to be official."

madisonwi,3arwaw,Jakeharrow,5,Tue Jun 23 00:38:03 2015 UTC,"I worked there for a very long time.  It was an amateur joke of a studio.  I was an artist there until they laid off the entire art team in 2013 so they could outsource their art from contractors abroad.  Before that, I had worked there for years and had done thousands of art assets for all of their games: which wasn't easy because they have no regard for art whatsoever, to them it was a complete after thought.  One of the very high-ups once told me he doesn't care how a game looks at all, and doesn't understand why anyone should care- something as an artist was intensely mortifying to hear from someone so high up. I mean, I worked my butt off to become a successful artist, and this guy was basically telling me I was a joke and video games don't need graphics.  They also pay much less than actual game studios in Madison.  The CEO is incredibly arrogant and who is more likely to be flying his plane or making sexist comments than to actually care about you.  ANYWAY- If you want to work at a real game studio, look at Raven or Human Head.  If you don't have the credentials, then starting at PerBlue can make sense- but if you are an artist definitely look elsewhere."
madisonwi,3arwaw,svenjj,3,Tue Jun 23 16:45:33 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to hear you had a bad experience, Jake - and thanks for sharing it (always interesting to hear past perspectives / history). I definitely know places can have their ups and downs, and I'm glad I work in the current environment as opposed to the one you experienced. Startups have a lot to learn, and some lessons are learned the hard way.  To my understanding, the team has grown a lot this year, and we definitely care how the games look. I can definitely tell that historically there was less of a focus on visuals, but now it is a huge priority for the company with a bunch of talented artists in-house.  As was mentioned in another thread, compensation is above-market now, and one thing you will get here is ownership (if you want it) of your work. Everyone has a voice here."
madisonwi,3arwaw,whoooooooooooooosh,3,Tue Jun 23 17:52:53 2015 UTC,"Anecdotal, but I know a few of the guys there. They love it, been there for a few years. They had an office off Odana road three years ago, but I'm not sure if it's still there since they were smaller then."
madisonwi,3arwaw,The_Plague_of_Custom,2,Tue Jun 23 02:30:10 2015 UTC,"I've met a few of the developers there as well. They seem enthusiastic about their jobs. The company has been steadily growing and has an enjoyable open floor-plan office just off Willy St.  My only misgiving about the company as a whole is that their games are freemium (free to play, but requiring microtransactions to make any meaningful progress), which is anathema to many gamers."
madisonwi,3arwaw,svenjj,4,Tue Jun 23 03:52:44 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I currently work at PerBlue  Opinions expressed are my own  I joined PerBlue back in February; I've been in the game industry for 6 years prior to that. One of the first things I noticed about the company is how friendly and welcoming everyone is here. There are no egos and everyone seems legitimately happy to be at work.  The management really seems to care about the team and its products, and I can have face time with anybody in the company whenever I might need it.   The company has a great culture involving regular summer grill outs, company outings (Mallards game coming up). We also do game nights, sponsored an Adult Swim at the Children's Museum. We have music playing in the office which is sort of a mix of everyone's tastes and can be voted on via one of our internal sites.  Benefits, comp, etc. are all good, but one of the best things for me is the understanding and work-life balance. Everyone works hard when they're here, but more than ever before I feel like I have time to pursue my own interests outside of work.  I don't know if I can tell you where the exact address is, but as other people have pointed out, we're in the Willy Street neighborhood; close to tasty food, the bike path, etc.  Feel free to ask questions and I'll answer what I can!"

We were told to copy Clash of Clans.  Repeatedly.  And that was for making ""Greed for Glory"".  Apparently one exact clone wasn't enough, so they made ""Titan Empires"".

Feingold could give a shit what goes on in this state, we need him to go do more important work.   Dane County elected officials get so wrapped up in making symbolic feel good resolutions or outright stupid legislation like making homelessness a protected class that they are incapable of governing at all. Try to develop a piece of property or even drive during a snowstorm. Basic government services are neglected or fucked up while our important progressive leaders try to rid the world of nuclear weapons or cure global warming on their own.   I think Republicans are complete morons on virtually everything they do. But they sure understand power and how to use it. This is a hysterical exhibition of it. Someone in Madison cant get property developed because Dane County and Madison strangle everything to death? Well the Republicans take over every piece of power in this state and just fuck Dane County in the ass. I think Republicans are inherently evil and inclined to do evil things. But because Dane County elected officials are so uncompromising, so focused on bullshit, and incapable of governing properly they somehow manage to earn this fuckathon.  Yes environmental considerations are extremely important. As is reasonable historical preservation. But Jesus Christ! You have managed to get to the point where the part of local control is looking you in the eyes, saying, we are going to fuck you because we can and because you go too far.

I just had a front-row seat on exactly the opposite happening. Despite significant questions about wetland protections from Friends of Starkweather Creak, T.

On a narrow practical standpoint, the potential flooding problems could make it inappropriate for anything to be built on the land in question beyond a few single-family homes, much less the density they're looking at. Several houses in the area have sump pumps running 24/7 as it is. That's not even getting into the environmental issues with the project.  The city Common Council approved it anyway."
madisonwi,3aouei,Sargos,3,Tue Jun 23 17:13:15 2015 UTC,Madison is so strapped for apartments nowadays that we should probably err on the side of new development.

madisonwi,3an30g,Donnian,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:25:04 2015 UTC,Try the ideal on park. Brand new and EVERYONE who lives there has a dog. PM me if you need details it's only about 6 or 7 blocks from heart of campus.
madisonwi,3alwgi,apoptoeses,4,Sun Jun 21 14:39:48 2015 UTC,"I like going to Owen Conservatory. It's quiet, not maybe many people go there and it's pretty hilly."
madisonwi,3alwgi,name_with_a_y,4,Mon Jun 22 00:00:09 2015 UTC,"Hi!  Trail/ultra runner here.  Madison has great trails to train on if you're willing to drive a little.  Living on the West side is best for trail running.  There are multiple sections of the Ice Age Trail, Blue Mound State Park, Devil's Lake, Governor Dodge State Park, Indian Lake, etc.  If you're willing to drive an hour, you've got access to Southern Kettle Moraine, which is where a lot of our ultras are run."
madisonwi,3alwgi,MMSquared2,2,Mon Jun 22 01:18:17 2015 UTC,"When I lived closer, I ran in UW Arboretum. I mean in it--most people run on the road through and never set foot on the actual trails.  Other than that, I'm guessing this is the kind of info you're looking for. You might also check out some segments of the Ice Age Trail."
madisonwi,3alwgi,emmatt,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:03:37 2015 UTC,Second the Arboretum.  Pretty nice trails that are well taken care of but will be challenging.
madisonwi,3alwgi,GeneUnit90,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:53:38 2015 UTC,Third up on the Arbor. There are some really amazing single-track trails in there...especially around Lost Forest.
madisonwi,3alwgi,mad_jer,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:25:47 2015 UTC,"City. Lost City, not Lost Forest. The forest is still there :) There was a development at one time that sunk into the wetland, which is what you get when developing in a wetland."
madisonwi,3alwgi,augen_zu_und_durch,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:08:18 2015 UTC,"Lost whatever. Who cares, really.  Besides, the map calls it ""lost city forest"" so we're both right, lol. Trees. Trails. A few old roads. Done."
madisonwi,3alwgi,mad_jer,2,Sat Jun 27 06:38:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, there is an ultra community in Madison. Lots of trails within the county and short driving distances. Single track, double track and rails to trails. Plenty of miles. Try Google for ultra races in Wisconsin and see what you like. You didn't mention large mammals or wild animals, poison plants, or unpredictable weather, are you sure you're an ultra runner? ;)"
madisonwi,3alwgi,augen_zu_und_durch,2,Sun Jun 21 17:09:10 2015 UTC,"Haha well in North Carolina I haven't encountered anything scarier than a couple copperheads and nothing larger than deer.  Florida however... Bears, gators, rattlers, copperheads, rabid raccoons... Haha you name it.  Good to hear there is an ultra community! Do you have any favorite races?"
madisonwi,3alwgi,augen_zu_und_durch,2,Sun Jun 21 17:17:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's stretch for you to start with the John Dick Memorial 50k to see if you can manage this relatively easy winter race, if so then the sky's your limit. This isn't east coast running. If you want long distances you're going to be on your own during many races as some are quite difficult unless you are in the N. or S. Kettle Moraine Units (Google..) near Milwaukee. Those races get a lot of city people and the feel is very different.   The usual breakdown for trail runners: are you loaded down with gear belts, have the latest gear in trendy colors, eat nothing but packaged trail food, want happy music and a pat on the head at every aid station, use earbuds religiously, finisher medals? Try all the Kettle Moraine races or Dances With Dirt and anything southeast Wisconsin or mostly-east Wisconsin   Want a campfire, actual food, potentially no recognition of a finish beyond applause (unless you're in the buckle club), possibly camping before a remote start, or year-round running, try the Great Lakes Endurance runs or Rocksteady and anything in west or north Wisconsin."
madisonwi,3alwgi,mad_jer,2,Sun Jun 21 17:55:56 2015 UTC,Haha the last 50k I did had 30 people in it... So definitely not looking for anything super fancy. Our ultra club is small but very supportive.   Also all the trail races I've done ban earbuds. Take it this doesn't happen here?  This is great info. Thanks for the run down!
madisonwi,3alwgi,augen_zu_und_durch,2,Sun Jun 21 18:18:02 2015 UTC,"Hey now, I'm signed up for Dances with Dirt. :) Medal or not, it looks like a super-fun race! :)"
madisonwi,3alwgi,tasunder,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:24:42 2015 UTC,"It is a fun race. Glad you're signed up. Which distance are you running? If not the 10k, it pays to practice the downhill at Parfreys because there are so many city people (yes, ok already, just stating a fact and not a criticism) who are uncomfortable flying that 2 mile down hill to the parking lot. You can improve your finishing order a lot by practicing your footfall on this section and passing (""on your left"") like crazy. Good luck!"
madisonwi,3alwgi,loblollyboy,2,Thu Jun 25 14:05:08 2015 UTC,Some good suggestions here.  I will just add that running loops around Pheasant Branch Conservancy is a decent option if you want to run loops so that you can stash water/fuel in your car.  There's one narrow path loop as well as some wider dirt paths.  Decent number of hills throughout.  I ran the wider dirt path in loops a lot during marathon training last year.
madisonwi,3an8ql,Thr0wAway114,4,Sun Jun 21 21:56:36 2015 UTC,"There aren't that many, I suggest taking a tour/trial of the ones near you and see what fits your style."
madisonwi,3an8ql,evandena,3,Sun Jun 21 22:39:19 2015 UTC,Capital fitness is pretty great. Full complement of weights (although only 2 benches/squat racks) as well as a ton of classes if those are your thing. It can get a bit busy during peak hours but I rarely have to wait long.
madisonwi,3an8ql,ResidencyEvil,2,Mon Jun 22 00:40:25 2015 UTC,"Cap Fitness is pretty nice but they bundle all the yoga/exercise classes into a basic membership, so it's a bit pricey (I got a $500/yr membership with a Black Friday deal but it's $660 on the website now). The cardio machines are generally open, weights are more hit or miss. I tried Pinnacle and wasn't a big fan. I don't know of many other gyms in the downtown area. I would suggest trying to bargain the price down a bit after your trial."
madisonwi,3an8ql,josephbuttons,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:18:12 2015 UTC,What didn't you like about Pinnacle?

madisonwi,3an8ql,joebenet,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:10:49 2015 UTC,"Pinnacle fitness is right on the square next to UW Credit Union. I signed up for 2 years and it's $45/mo. I like it because in the mornings it's much quieter and that when I prefer to get in there. They have classes, a weight area, free weights, personal training, and cardio equipment."
madisonwi,3an8ql,Mhm426,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:22:40 2015 UTC,Holy poop that's expensive. Or it is just me that thinks that?!
madisonwi,3an8ql,PsykCheech,3,Mon Jun 22 01:02:26 2015 UTC,"Pinnacle is one of the nicest gyms in town, and it's right on the square."
madisonwi,3an8ql,new-money,2,Mon Jun 22 15:30:29 2015 UTC,"It's all relative. It's kind of expensive for Madison, but my gym in Colorado is $90 a month."
madisonwi,3an8ql,joebenet,0,Mon Jun 22 03:11:29 2015 UTC,"It's expensive most places, 24 hour fitness in Denver is $15 per month of you sign up for 2 years. Planet fitness is $10 a month, month to month. The most I've ever had to pay was $35 a month when I went to anytime fitness."
madisonwi,3an8ql,22cthulu,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:55:38 2015 UTC,There are cheaper gyms in Madison - e.g. there's a $10/mo Planet Fitness - but the Capitol area is pretty high demand so the prices reflect that.
madisonwi,3an8ql,tasunder,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:25:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's expensive, but I also don't have a car and I'm not on a joint plan....so I decided to just do it...."
madisonwi,3an8ql,Mhm426,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:51:36 2015 UTC,Pinnacle and Capitol fitness are both within a couple blocks of the square
madisonwi,3an8ql,vatoniolo,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:32:45 2015 UTC,"Pinnacle does not do month-to-month membership unless you only sign up for one month, let the membership expire at the end of the month, and then re-join with a new membership for the next month....and you'll be paying a premium for that, perhaps the most expensive monthly rate in town. It's not so much worth it as much as that's simply what people in the neighborhood are willing to pay.  Pretty much every gym in town is beginner-friendly, especially for those in the ""just to keep in shape"" crowd."
madisonwi,3an8ql,FatBikeFanatic,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:35:18 2015 UTC,Capital Fitness does not offer month-to-month for new members.  I think Pinnacle does.  There's also Orange Shoe on the square if you want the cadillac option.  There's an Anytime Fitness that's about 0.75 miles away from the Capitol.
madisonwi,3an8ql,tasunder,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:17:12 2015 UTC,"I like Capital Fitness. $50 down (25 if you work for the State or Epic) and $50/mo (doesn't change). I am a beginner too and they offer a personal trainer special for new members (4 sessions + 1 introductory for $180). I think you have to push your trainer to what you prefer (Josh was great but had me on machines most of the sessions not free weights which I wanted to learn more about).  They have two locations, 1 on East Wash., the other on West Wash. I have only been to the one on West Washington and I like it. The only thing I do not like is it is not open 24 hours. Anytime fitness near the University is open 24/7 and I have heard good things about it."
madisonwi,3an8ql,VufenMC,-2,Mon Jun 22 17:25:52 2015 UTC,"Ok, quit listening to people suggesting Capital Fitness. It's awful. It's seriously the worst gym I've ever been a member of. I was there for three years. The gym is not kept clean, and the basement stinks. The weight room is split between two levels, so you area always having to run through the whole gym to find open equipment, and the gym is way too crowded.  Join Pinnacle on the Square. It's where I worked out before Capital, and loved it (but switched because Capital is so much cheaper)."

An agreement to waive the requirements of this section in a residential tenancy is void. Nothing in this section is intended to affect rights and duties arising under other provisions of the statutes.  (2) Duty of landlord. (a) Unless the repair was made necessary by the negligence or improper use of the premises by the tenant, the landlord is under duty to:   Keep in reasonable state of repair portions of the premises over which the landlord maintains control; Keep in a reasonable state of repair all equipment under the landlord's control necessary to supply services which the landlord has expressly or impliedly agreed to furnish to the tenant, such as heat, water, elevator or air conditioning; Make all necessary structural repairs;   4.

madisonwi,3alok4,_stonecoldsaidso,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:00:08 2015 UTC,"The issue is that it's not a broken pipe, it's a clogged pipe. Clogged pipes aren't a mechanical failure, they're caused by use. Not saying you did anything wrong, but pipes generally don't clog unless something was put down them that wasn't supposed to be. Look at it from your landlords perspective.  If it was a broken pipe, then your landlord would pay for it. A clogged pipe though probably not. It's not really much different than a clogged toilet, or a burnt out light bulb.   Realistically though, it's probably just your garbage disposal. There should be a trap in it that you can clean out. Make sure you disconnect the power first. After you've got it clean, my recommendation is to pretend that you don't have a garbage disposal at all and don't put anything solid down the drain. The cheap garbage disposals that landlords tend to install have a tendency to clog quite often and are more trouble than they're worth."

madisonwi,3alok4,Rignite,2,Sun Jun 21 18:03:35 2015 UTC,"Basically, because clogged pipes are something that are completely avoidable in most situations by the tenants just general good upkeeping of the place, it's something that your property manager has set up to be something they don't cover.  Try calling Roto Rooter. And dumping less stuff down your garbage disposal in general. The true proper use of a garbage disposal is to use it only when absolutely necessary, not all the time."

madisonwi,3alok4,legsintheair,-4,Mon Jun 22 12:50:07 2015 UTC,"the whole reason why I am renting is so I don't have to deal with hiring a plumber   I find this very hard to believe. If you're willing to go through the trouble of taking pipes apart (which you really shouldn't be doing in a rental) you should probably not complain about having to pay for a plumber.  You are most likely liable for this issue, unless there is a problem with the main sewer line. If you don't resolve it your landlord will take the plumber costs out of your security deposit, now that you've brought it to their attention. Either way, call (and pay for) a plumber. If they discover it is a problem with the main then your landlord should be grateful it was addressed right away.  I apologize for sounding harsh but this is the reality. I also apologize for not having a recommendation."

Just make sure to photograph the entire apartment when you move in, and when they try to withhold part of your security deposit when you move out, tell them you took photos. If they still resist, tell them you will see them in small claims court (assuming you actually cleaned and are not in the wrong).  Withholding security deposits is part of the business model for a lot of the big campus rental companies, because they know most students won't fight it."
madisonwi,3amgat,new-money,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:33:53 2015 UTC,"I disagree about MPM. It really depends on which of their units you live in. My first time with them (first year off campus) was terrible. Lots of stuff was broken when we moved in, it took forever to get stuff fixed, and the people we talked to at MPM seemed to get annoyed at us. The second time has been fine, even minor issues have been fixed in a timely manner and there have been extra improvements made to the building.  I wouldn't say just not to live with MPM at all, especially when they have so many properties. Just be selective and see if you can ask the current residents a few questions when you tour the place. Take pictures, save documents, and in general be on top of things so they know you're competent and any issues will be easier to solve."

madisonwi,3aftcg,Porkstacker,6,Fri Jun 19 21:19:06 2015 UTC,"Well, shit. Hopefully they didn't do too much damage to your account!"
madisonwi,3aftcg,Porkstacker,5,Fri Jun 19 21:19:58 2015 UTC,"Thankfully they didn't, and what they did get will be refunded once the paperwork clears.  Visa fraud protection shut down my account after just the one purchase though, I think the near simultaneous purchases at Woodman's and somewhere in Texas may have tipped them off...  They didn't get my PIN so it could have been worse, but I'm pretty obsessive about covering the keypad when I'm inputting it.  When I turned in my fraud paperwork the teller mentioned the skimmer, about 200 UWCU customers have been hit so far including employees.    Keep alert this weekend, double check everything on the ATMs you're using, even ones you use all the time!"
madisonwi,3aftcg,sellyberry,3,Fri Jun 19 21:34:38 2015 UTC,It got used in Texas? I guess they sold the info online.
madisonwi,3aftcg,new-money,2,Fri Jun 19 21:36:23 2015 UTC,Might explain why we suddenly got new credit cards sent to us.  I had a charge stopped when someone in New Jersey was trying to use my debit card. They caught it and it never even showed up on my statement.
madisonwi,3aftcg,new-money,7,Fri Jun 19 23:02:20 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately there's not that much you can do about this. You should always look at the ATM to see if there have been any obvious modifications, but I don't think most people would even recognize a skimmer -- they are designed to not be noticed. Just make sure to always check your transactions at least weekly, if not daily. I use the Mint phone app to keep an eye on all of my accounts and transactions, and it's pretty easy."
madisonwi,3aftcg,Porkstacker,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:27:21 2015 UTC,I just use the teller whenever possible and that helps but you're still vulnerable at gas pumps and some credit card readers.
madisonwi,3aftcg,Abzug,8,Fri Jun 19 21:29:52 2015 UTC,"You're more protected at gas pumps when you're using a credit card. That's not your money, it's VISA's, and they will protect their money.  But for ATM withdrawals with a debit card, it really sucks. You will almost certainly get the money back from your bank's fraud protection, but it's still a hassle, especially if your checking account gets drained and you have bills to pay.  Friendly reminder to not keep all of your cash in a checking account. If your debit card is linked to a checking account, and you're living paycheck to paycheck, you should be keeping some money in a savings account and transfer it to checking when you have a bill to pay."
madisonwi,3aftcg,BatmanInTheHood,3,Fri Jun 19 21:33:05 2015 UTC,"Good advice, just be careful whenever you use a credit card that you pay it off religiously every month.  Interest will suck your bank account dry too, and unlike with a fraudster you have zero chance of seeing that money again."

madisonwi,3acidr,likeahorse15,7,Sun Jun 21 06:28:06 2015 UTC,"Judging by how spaced out their house was from their neighbors and the fact that they were 35 minutes away from the airport, I'd say Sun Prairie, Cottage Grove, or Burke."
madisonwi,3acidr,coffeenima,6,Fri Jun 19 03:29:06 2015 UTC,35 minutes is actually quite far and can get you there all the way from Oregon with a few minutes to spare
madisonwi,3acidr,Niehaus,3,Fri Jun 19 03:31:50 2015 UTC,"Don't forget, it was snowing/wintertime when they left. I've left my place (near Burke) and barely made it to my office downtown (about the same amount of driving as it would take to get to the airport) in 30 minutes plenty of times, especially when there's snow involved.  Clearly, the only solution is to wait for winter and then drive from the airport North, South, East, and West and find out how far you can get in 35 minutes. This will give us a perimeter wherein we can assume the family lives.  Upon further consideration, the airport shoots off straight to Waunakee, so they could have easily been there. Judging by the age of the kids and the parents' assumed economic status in order for them to send their kids to fucking dinosaur land, Waunakee might be the best bet.  There's one other possibility that would place the residence in the Madison city limits, but still put some space between the house and the neighbors."

madisonwi,3acidr,StarPower1,4,Fri Jun 19 02:41:35 2015 UTC,"Okay but did little kids repair a jeep with no tools and a motorcycle battery?  Did they lose a dinosaur in it's own cage while it had a fully functional gps tracker?  At least the original JP had it's moments and left you with a lasting impression after you went home. JW was riddled with plot holes, 2 dimensional characters, and blatant product placement."
madisonwi,3acidr,MichaelKarmaWhore,8,Fri Jun 19 02:53:53 2015 UTC,But dinosaurs!
madisonwi,3acidr,StarPower1,3,Fri Jun 19 03:10:48 2015 UTC,"Because the jeep sat there for 20 years and the only thing that really went bad was a battery, also it was in a garage. There are tools in garages  Yes they did because they panicked like dumbs.  The product placement was half product placement and half done on purpose because every amusement park is riddled with brands. For that matter what is the problem with product placement? Things have brands and their logos show up on those things. It's more annoying to obviously remove every Mercedes logo from any scene.   Yea the writing was bad. But if you went in expecting Shakespeare,  then you went in with the wrong attitude. This movie knew what it was and it shamelessly flaunted that even in the trailers. It's a stupid awesome movie with goddamn mothe fucking dinosaurs."
madisonwi,3acidr,event_horizon_,3,Fri Jun 19 06:44:45 2015 UTC,"I'll give you the first two, but the product placement was lampshaded pretty heavily and it made sense in a movie like that.  Really, I thought its biggest weakness was how much it called back to the original movie.  They needed the kid who was a dinosaur nut, they needed the jeep to show up again, etc.  Forcing those references created some of those problems.  But I liked a lot of what they did with it.  I liked that they made a successful theme park, and that they really had learned from the first movies...they just learned the wrong lesson.  I liked that they finally managed to bring in non-annoying new characters in a JP sequel, and that even though they did bring in a little unnecessary personal drama (""hey our parents are getting divorced and this is a really important thing that won't get mentioned again for the rest of the movie"") but it was brief and didn't take over the movie.  I guess that I really liked it because I went in expecting another shitty Jurassic Park sequel that I only went to because friends wanted to go, and what I got was a surprisingly clever, fun (if imperfect) movie."

It is a great way to meet people and after each game your team gets a free pitcher of beer at the Great Dane!  Mufa.org is the website."
madisonwi,3aaw30,Absalome,3,Thu Jun 18 17:03:45 2015 UTC,"Came here to suggest MUFA.   There are 4000+ players in the summer league (largest in the country), /u/slackmotherfucker_. You're a little late to sign up for that, but keep tabs on their website around mid-August to try to catch the sign-up for fall league. I'd say the average age of players in fall league (and maybe in MUFA as a whole) is somewhere around 23-27. You can sign up with one other person or by yourself. Most teams go to the Dane after games, and that's a great time to get to know your teammates.  If you don't want to wait for league play, there are a number of pick-up games around the city on weekends. The most casual/accessible one is on Sundays at 1pm. There's usually a mix of ages and skill levels there, and they're very welcoming to new players.  If you've ever enjoyed playing any sports in the past, you should definitely try this out! You'll be hard-pressed to find a more inclusive, friendly community just about anywhere -- plus it's fun and great exercise! Just make sure you bring lots of water and cleats if you have 'em."

madisonwi,3aaw30,name_with_a_y,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:30:51 2015 UTC,For sure. Jph on Johnson is my favorite for sure. If you sit at one of the shared tables colectivo is pretty social. A lot of my friends really love barriques on w. Wash but it doesn't feel as friendly to me. Ancora has a bottomless cup for about $3 as well. Let me know if you ever want to grad a coffee.

madisonwi,3aaw30,Toofywoofy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:33:24 2015 UTC,"I moved to Madison with my girlfriend last July after graduating and got a lot of the same advice you're getting on this thread. Meeting people in a new city can definitely be awkward at first, especially if you're kinda shy about talking to randos, but you really just gotta do it. Fortunately, I think you'll find people in Madison are exceptionally friendly. Things I tried:  Meeting people through reddit. I know it can feel weird, but it's a lot more common than you think. Hung out with a few different people and didn't get along with most of them. Ended up being really good friends with one couple my girlfriend and I met up with though!  Coffee shops/bars. I don't know about you but I don't typically go to coffee shops to talk to people. Bars are a totally different story. If you're trying to meet people go to a bar during trivia night. People are usually more interactive when there's actually something going on. Talk to bartenders and employees. They usually have large friend groups who hang out and drink with them, and getting to know them is an easy way to elbow your way into an already established group of friends. I'd advise staying away from most of the college-y bars on state street and stick to the bars around the Capitol square (check out Tipsy Cow, Great Dane, Argus, and Rigby, my personal favorites). Most State St bars are full of college students getting fucked up and trying to get fucked, and I find it's a bad environment to have an actual conversation.   Actually talk to random people. The first person me and my girlfriend hung out with was a girl working at Walgreens who I started joking around with about not knowing anyone here. Second time we hung out with people we were really drunk and started talking to random people outside a bar. Alcohol is great at breaking social barriers!  Get a job. Honestly, my only real friends here I met at my first job in Madison. It probably helped that I was working at The Tipsy Cow so we could just drink after work, but any time you're around people every day is going to force you to make friends.   I never tried any clubs, but I can imagine it's a good way to meet people who like the same stuff as you. One MAJOR piece of advice: don't let age be a barrier to friendship. I was so used to having close friends my own age in school. As soon as you leave college the playing field is totally level, and now I'm the youngest in most of my friend groups. My best friends here are in their mid-20s and I honestly love it.  Hope you like your first summer in Madison and PM me if you want to know anything else about the city!  Edit: also music! I was totally surprised when I moved here, but there are a lot of awesome artists who come through Madison. I like indie and electronic stuff mostly, and there is usually at least one show a week that I would go to."

Everything else is freelance and they likely aren't AS motivated to put out the same quality content as full time employees.   That said, I'm a little disappointed in this one.   EDIT: Qualified my comment on the freelancers motivation. Also, with full time employees I imagine it's easier to collaborate on stories, share ideas, decide on themes, etc. I can draw any number of analogies, but simply put you get a better (and obviously more consistent) product by having employees working together than by using separate independent contractors"

It's also kind of disappointing how it's gone to almost all opinion columns, but I understand that's the way the entire industry is going so there's not much you can do there.   Thanks a lot for the response, by the way. I was kind of just complaining and didn't expect any real feedback, so I appreciate it! I really like the isthmus and it's still good so please don't take my whining the wrong way."

I think we kind of tried to bridge that gap with the new Itinerary section at the front of the paper in combination with the Isthmus Picks in the arts section. I totally agree with you about the opinion overload, but I think the idea was to provide a space for ""Madison voices"" to sound off about the issues of the day.

madisonwi,3ac03e,_stonecoldsaidso,3,Thu Jun 18 21:50:59 2015 UTC,"I do think it's the type of place where you could make ""friends"" with the doorman. The doorman is usually a grumpy guy sitting on a stool, but I have gone to a show there before where I didn't know there would be a cover and just asked the guy if he would give us 2-for-1, and he did.  You certainly won't get in unless you ask. It's not against the law to let you in, so if you can convince them you won't drink you might have a chance."

The frustrating thing is that they also seem to think they are gods gift to trans people.  I was at a trans health forum not to long ago and endured listening to one of them go on about how great she was for 20 minutes.  I didn't have the heart to tell her that when I was starting HRT her office staff refused to book an appointment for me to see her.  Dodged a bullet.    Anyway - I found an amazing endo (an actual endo!) who works with me and listens and orders tests and treats me like a human.   The down side is that I have to go to Sheboygan to see her.    Inbox me if you want her info."

If she wants to have a practice that serves trans people job 1 is going to make sure her staff knows what is up.    When I called my endo, and explained why I wanted to see her, the VERY FIRST thing the receptionist said was ""do you have a preferred name and pronoun?"" And they have NEVER once failed to use it.

madisonwi,3a8fmc,doxiegrl1,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:23:50 2015 UTC,Definitely not. I think the average of 6 months X (electric heat cost - gas heat cost) is less than 12 months X $21. It does depend on the size of the place and whether or not there are roommates
madisonwi,3a8fmc,vatoniolo,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:10:19 2015 UTC,"I mean, in the winter when I'm actually using a lot of heat, the $18 wouldn't be as big of a deal, especially since apparently the unit charge has gone down. But for them to charge me that every month until October or so, when I want to start heating, is not fair. The central heat in my apartment is the only thing that uses the gas."
madisonwi,3a8fmc,endau,12,Thu Jun 18 02:49:34 2015 UTC,The unit rate barely went down. MG&E just over doubled their fixed connection fees (for gas and electric) to punish people who try to conserve energy and people with solar panels.
madisonwi,3a8fmc,tmntman,6,Thu Jun 18 04:12:42 2015 UTC,You're stuck.  And unfortunately MG&E just doubled the meter fees at the start of this year.  Prior to that it would have been around $10 a month.
madisonwi,3a8fmc,Vislion21,7,Thu Jun 18 02:20:10 2015 UTC,"The fees were increased so that they can upgrade their system. The public has been wanting to be able to feed into MG&E's system  (and get paid for it) if their off the grid system (solar/wind/etc.) produces more than what they, personally, use. MG&E's system needs an upgrade in order to do this - and more money to pay for it/get it done quicker - but no one seems to want to pay. Improvements/upgrades cost money (that goes for everything, not just for power companies; roads, schools, etc.)."
madisonwi,3a8fmc,vatoniolo,6,Thu Jun 18 13:24:08 2015 UTC,"This is actually a reasonable, albeit unpopular, response, but I think the bigger users should still be paying a bigger share."
madisonwi,3a8fmc,ughkevinbacon,3,Thu Jun 18 15:21:19 2015 UTC,"if the system is off grid, it doesn't connect to the grid and wouldn't affect the demand response. Of those systems that are grid-tied, a smaller percentage used to have  net-metering, in which they received the same rate charged (kWh) for any excess. Most participating utilities no longer offer that under the FOE rewards.   The amount of renewable is small, and cost is keeping it that way. The grid needs upgrading because it is old and shitty not because of demand response from  residential renewable energy."
madisonwi,3a8fmc,ughkevinbacon,2,Fri Jun 19 05:48:46 2015 UTC,"You can find a definition of the fees on your bill, and the rate classes here: http://www.mge.com/customer-service/billing/about-bill/definitions.htm  The drastic increase in service charges by the major utilities in WI, especially considering their profits, was a hotly contested issue. Many people voiced their opposition with the PSC but we still ended up with high service charges."
madisonwi,3a8fmc,jkdeadite,2,Fri Jun 19 05:59:39 2015 UTC,They just increased this minimum customer service charge a few months ago. It makes the big companies around town pay less for their energy.  You have no options - you are fucked with this charge no matter what.

madisonwi,3a8uk5,antisweep,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:52:38 2015 UTC,"Howdy neighbor!  I have Cricket Wireless (uses AT&T towers) and it's fine.  No issues at all with service, and it's cheap (35 dollars a month).  If you want to switch to Cricket, I suggest buying an unlocked GSM phone (like the Moto G, Moto X, OneplusOne, Iphone etc.) rather than purchasing a phone from Cricket.  Their phone lineup kind of sucks, but they have a great Bring Your Own Device program.  Here's a list of AT&T MVNOs: http://bestmvno.com/att-mvnos.html  My significant other has Verizon, and it sucks donkey in this neighborhood.  We got a network extender to help with Verizon, because my SO can't switch providers (the phone is provided by employer)."
madisonwi,3a8uk5,aertime,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:37:35 2015 UTC,Thanks for the response! Can you recommend a network extender if we wanted to go that route?
madisonwi,3a8uk5,aertime,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:23:59 2015 UTC,"As far as I know there's only one that Verizon offers: http://www.verizonwireless.com/accessories/samsung-network-extender-scs-2u01/  It's not cheap, and also it works by using your internet connection to create a Cellular Hotspot for voice calls (I don't think it does anything for data, and you should be connected to local wifi instead anyway).  So, if you don't have good internet speeds it won't work very well.  We have Charter internet, so it works fine, but I find it annoying that not only did we have to pay for the network extender, Verizon is piggy backing on our internet rather than building/fixing nearby cellular towers. My significant other would drop Verizon if it weren't a work phone, and I can't over emphasize how much their service sucks in this neighborhood.  Thankfully we don't pay for the monthly bill for that phone."
madisonwi,3a8uk5,legsintheair,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:55:53 2015 UTC,"No, U.S. Cellular has the best coverage in the rural areas of Wisconsin. In urban areas they are not as good coverage wise."
madisonwi,3a7k5i,doctahjosie,3,Wed Jun 17 21:10:33 2015 UTC,"I work at a pharmacy outside of the direct Madison area, and I've seen one before, just not in a while.  Your best bet is to see if a pharmacy can order one for you.  Places are probably not familiar with this generic, but you could give them the NDC number (national drug code) which if you're looking for the 0.3mg would be either 54505-102-02 for the 2 pack or 54505-102-01 for a single one.  I've never seen the single one, only the 2 pack, but who knows, maybe someone's wholesaler can get it.  Anyways, with that they could probably check the price, and Lineage's coupon online takes up to $300 off.  Most places can order products for the following business day.  You would need a prescription for it whether its written for a person or for clinic use.  The prescription would need to specifically be for the generic, since it's not a direct substitute for the Epipen brand name."

madisonwi,3a1h9b,schlach,6,Tue Jun 16 18:24:15 2015 UTC,"Nah. Even if there is some master overlord plan, people moving from a Blueish-purple state will sometimes end up in Red to Redish-purple state, or solidifying other Bluish-purple states. In other words, you give up on one state to solidify a hold on another, or you give up a slight advantage in one state to create a slight possibility in another. That's not clearly a win.  If you could control where movers end up (concentrating Blue movers into already solidly-Blue states), then you could have control over the Presidential Electoral College.

madisonwi,3a2jvo,ktourdot,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:20:45 2015 UTC,"I agree with you.  I didn't think they were that bad noise-wise.  Some audio alert is necessary because of both the heavy pedestrian traffic downtown and certain drivers who could use a refresher driver's ed course.    There are a lot more annoying noises and sounds on the bus.  I personally find the constant pinging when people pull the cord for the bus to stop irritating.  Part of is the sound, but many stops are spaced too closely together.  It's a waste of fuel to stop at every quarter mile stop.    Metro needs a civility/courtesy campaign for its riders ASAP.  I don't think it's too much for you to stay off your phone for the 15 minutes to half hour that you are on the bus.  I got stuck sitting next to one older woman who was on her phone almost the entire time from the time I got on to when she got off, almost a half hour.  I didn't care to hear her talk to her elderly mother like the mother was a small child.  There are some conversations that you don't want others to overhear.  I don't think it would be a terrible idea for Metro to designate some buses as quiet buses where no phone calls or louder conversations are allowed.  Other mass transit systems have quiet cars and those are largely self policed by the passengers, like Metra in Chicago area."

madisonwi,3a2jvo,gacorley,2,Wed Jun 17 12:08:23 2015 UTC,cheap $50 android phone   What? Is that the phone or the monthly plan?
madisonwi,3a2jvo,_stonecoldsaidso,3,Wed Jun 17 12:46:48 2015 UTC,"Both, I guess.   You can pick up a halfway decent android phone for under $100 easily. Probably get a refurb one, or maybe a model that is a few versions old. Then you could go to a prepaid second-party service reseller (e.g. Consumer Cellular or Straight Talk) and pay ~45/month for talk+text+data, with no contract. I would find a reseller that works on the AT&T network, that seems to have the best results in Wisconsin.  Right now I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 (4 years old) and paying $45/month for service, and everything works just fine. It's a bit slow on Google Maps, but other than that there's no issues. BusRadar works great. For my purposes it's pretty much indistinguishable from the usual $700 phone and $120/month plan that most people have."

madisonwi,3a3mgg,tasunder,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:32:42 2015 UTC,I have not used two men and a truck but the estimate I got from them was well over $2000 for less than 6 hours of moving.

madisonwi,3a3mgg,AnotherRandomPervert,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:55:09 2015 UTC,So we ended up using them and at the time of the price quote the person who wrote our estimate said that if the company underestimated the time needed and the work was not completed by the end of the scheduled time the movers would stay and help us until the work was completed. We were told that it would not cost us additional if this happened because the miscalculation of time was their error. The actual gentlemen who moved us were very nice but within 2 hours of starting they told us that they would never be able to be done on time and strongly suggested that I should prepare to pay double the rate that I was quoted. Instead of being able to assist with the move I had to spend a couple of hours fielding phone calls from their office trying to straighten this issue out because I did not have several hundred extra dollars laying around due to a problem on their end. In the end the moving team managed to get done within a half an hour of the promise time and I was not charged for the overage. They refused to admit that they had given me incorrect information but they ensured that I did not have to pay extra.. I spoke to the estimate writer herself and she claimed she never would have made that comment but I know she did because they were the only company who made a guarantee like that and so that was my deciding factor when I chose them.  Make sure that you go over precisely what will happen if they under book the time because now almost every person I've heard of who used this company had time overages.

I can only assume it's to be with you and your husband, and not to simply do things they already know they like. Unless they're the type to complain loudly or take things they don't enjoy out on you (as the daughter-in-law), I think you need to expand their horizons -- gently -- and show them what Madison is best at, not what they might already like about Madison.   They love peace and quiet and appreciate beauty but you say they don't like nature. That's...weird. Try taking a walk in the UW Arboretum. It's paved, it's got shade, I'm sure there are benches if they wanted to pack a book and take a siesta to read a chapter.  They hate crowds but love The Old Fashioned. That's...weird. Give them a shot at some similar experiences that push at their limits just a little. Nostrano, maybe, or Oliver's. Not super-packed but definitely popular, and both pouring some enjoyable cocktails in a cozy environment.  They don't like beer but enjoy air conditioning? Take them on a brewery tour at Ale Asylum, or New Glarus (if you can book a hard hat tour; they're currently all booked up for June). Even the self-guided tour at New Glarus is nice, as is the faux-historic beer garden in back. Great Neapolitan style pizza usually on offer on Saturdays, from La Fortuna.  I don't envy your task, but I think it's time to really show them Madison, not subject slim shavings of Madison for their approval."

A ballcap at, say, L'Etoile might get a little bit of a raised eyebrow, but not from staff. But you're not looking to go there anyway. (You didn't say where you're coming from, so apologies if any of the following is already obvious to you.)  I'd say skip the Capitol square altogether if you want to avoid crowd-choked and visitor-obvious. Blue Moon and Oliver's are right across from each other on the near west side. Blue Moon is basically a bar -- legit great cheeseburger, though -- while Oliver's is more of a farm-to-table kind of thing. Both do solid work with tap lists.  On the near east side, check out Grampa's Pizzeria on Williamson. Can definitely be crowded -- call ahead -- but the food is great and the tap list is tight and interesting. Same is true for the Tip Top Tavern, though I was just there the other day and the tap list was a little one-note (lots of lemony flavors, which I guess is fine for late spring, but still).  You could always dine at a taproom: Ale Asylum and Karben4 make the IPAs that Madison, almost inarguably, goes wildest for. Ale Asylum's Hopalicious is basically Spotted Cow's IPA competitor for most ubiquitous craft beer in the state, and Karben4's Fantasy Factory is the It Beer right now. Both have respectable food menus in addition to wonderful, wonderful taps.  Dexter's and Brasserie V are two of my favorites, also mentioned elsewhere here. Definitely strong contenders."

madisonwi,3a3qzd,daveedster,2,Wed Jun 17 22:44:34 2015 UTC,"You can wear jeans and a ballcap into just about any restaurant in town.  We don't really believe in getting dressed up for dinner.  I'd recommend The Old Fashioned which has an extensive WI beer list and good pub food.  I wouldn't recommend Tipsy Cow, last time I was there I waited a very long time for service and eventually my husband asked why we keep going there.  Merchant has good food and cocktails but a smaller beer list than some of the other places.  There's Brassiere V if you're into Belgian food and beer.    For beer choices, be sure to try something from Karben4.  They make good IPAs and generally try for a good balance between hops and malts."
madisonwi,3a3qzd,Atherial,3,Wed Jun 17 01:31:23 2015 UTC,"No questions, go with the old fashioned.  The draft beer list is one of the best in the entire city, and the food is excellent!  I recommend the beer cheese soup, it is fantastic and it is right downtown close to a couple of the show venues.  Also, it has a nice view of the capital.  Enjoy the city, and if you like porters they have one on tap called night train that I highly recommend!"

If you'd like more food options and a slightly dressier atmosphere, then I'd recommend the Old Fashioned downtown or The Vintage on Whitney Way (western Madison)."

They were fantastic to work with.  One of our dogs in particular was very special needs (as in brain damaged) and was unable to be traditionally trained yet they worked with us to keep her in class to socialize her with dogs outside the home pack and do as much specialized training with her as possible.

I'll be moving to Madison at the end of January when my current lease is up and am looking to either rent a room or find a roommate. Doing some research on Madison I'd like to find something on the Near East Side, or maybe a bit further east. My budget is roughly 600-750 per month including utilities and internet(not that interested in cable/satellite/tv but will split it).   Requirements: The house must be non-smoking and have off street parking, inside of a reasonable quite neighborhood. I love my sleep, and I hate having it interrupted by a party in the apartment upstairs. I don't care where you're at on the male/female spectrum, though I would prefer to find a roommate who is at least 25 years old.   A bit about me: I'm 26, male, I have a B.A. in Poli Sci, non-smoker, occasional drinker(2-3 times a month), 420 friendly but I don't imbibe myself. I'm very nerdy and work a lot. I'm a work hard, play hard, sleep hard, kind of person. Right now I'm working 70 hours a week, I play board games on Tuesday night, table top war games on Saturday morning, and will sleep at least 16 hours on Sunday. Once I'm in Madison I'll most likely be either working, at the closest game shop, or sleeping; though I may pick up discgolf and cycling. I don't have any pets, and am fine with any pets you may have, other than birds and reptiles.    If you think you'll have a room I can fill, shoot me a PM or reply to this post and we can talk."

The 10yr unit in my rental would go off after every shower, every damn one, so I just took the piece of junk down.  A couple years back, the unit in the upstairs apartment went off after they painted.  Since there were no tenants at the time and the painter left the door unlocked, I took it down, threw it in a kitchen drawer away from the paint vapors, and left a note for the new tenant and rental manager to find the next day.

There isn't a slightly more expensive alternative that would eliminate this issue and your landlord is just too cheap to buy it.    Also, people should be aware that tampering with a smoke alarm as you suggest will result in a fine from the city when they do an inspection.

On August 15, 2009 all owners of residential buildings, except owner-occupied single family homes, shall install and maintain a smoke alarm in each bedroom, in every sleeping area and within six (6) feet of each door leading to a bedroom or sleeping area of each unit and on each floor of the building. This subdivision does not apply to owners of hotels and motels"

madisonwi,39uin5,Mswindupbird89,8,Mon Jun 15 03:00:13 2015 UTC,Just go with UWCU... I've never had a better bank.
madisonwi,39uin5,mojitomartini,11,Mon Jun 15 04:49:24 2015 UTC,"Summit has left a bad taste in my mouth after trying to get a mortgage loan from them. My fiancé has banked with them for 16 years, and when we put in our app, they ran the numbers and did everything but shove us out the door. We met with someone from a different company, and we're almost instantly accepted. He gave us one thing to do that would easily raise my credit rating to qualify for the loan we wanted, which we did, and we qualified no problem. He also told us every time he's had to work with Summit, they were complete jackasses. He highly recommends UW Credit Union, and I trust his judgement.   TL;DR If it doesn't bother you to be treated like an account number, go to Summit. If you want to be treated like a person, go to UW Credit Union."
madisonwi,39uin5,2amlullaby,4,Sun Jun 14 23:41:13 2015 UTC,"I have to recommend Summit, since I've been with them for so long (since they were the State Capitol Employees Credit Union). I've done pretty much everything with them, including a mortgage.  When I was about to get married, I knew that we'd eventually be getting a house, so I went in and talked with one of their financial advisers. We worked out a plan in advance so that they'd have no problems getting me the best rates, and I followed it.  When we finally decided to buy, there were no hassles and everything went through. I'd say the moral is the story is that Summit is pretty big and so your experience can vary based on who you're dealing with. I worked over at the Junction Road Summit with two different people and they were great.  No matter what you do, you have some great choices in Madison. I'd say you can't go wrong as long as you go with a Credit Union, and you have many options.  I work for a small business that goes through UW Credit Union, and they've been good to us as well, so I don't have anything really bad to say about them either."
madisonwi,39uin5,cibman,18,Mon Jun 15 13:50:53 2015 UTC,"UW Credit union and Summit are the best local options. Stay the hell away from US Bank, Wells Fargo, and Chase."
madisonwi,39uin5,vatoniolo,2,Sun Jun 14 22:12:01 2015 UTC,"U.S. Bank is actually not at all like chase or Wells Fargo.  They are the only national bank that did not get involved in the mortgage bubble and the collapse of 2008.    If you have an account you also get a person - an actual person with a name and a desk - at your branch who will help with any issues you have with your account.  Also - free parking on the square if you see a teller.    Obviously I am pretty happy with them.    I had UWCU and I liked them a lot... But when I got divorced I wanted to keep all my finances separate from my X, and not risk any sort of confusion.  So I went to US Bank and have been even happier."

madisonwi,39uin5,Litterbug21,6,Mon Jun 15 02:25:39 2015 UTC,All the big banks have higher fees and stricter policies than the local credit unions.

madisonwi,39uin5,sumkindofelectrichat,6,Mon Jun 15 21:44:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure which part of my statement you wanted me to respond to so I'll answer both:  Members of credit unions have a lot more influence and say in how the credit union is run.  They're allowed to vote for the board of directors, for example.  They're non-profit so they don't have to do questionable things to maximize their profit like banks do.  And most credit unions are smaller, so you tend to get better and more personalized customer service.  As for Wells Fargo - I've never been a customer, but through my job I deal a lot with Wells Fargo and I've seen them do enough illegal and just downright terrible things to customers and their accounts so I wouldn't wish them on my worst enemy."

It is the greenest solution!  If you can't find anyone to take them, here's how to destroy them:  For paint:  You can use all the paint (spray scrap wood) or pour it out onto something, then let that dry, then dispose of normally.    For thinner:  Leave it open, it will evaporate.  Compressed air cans:  Spray all the air out, then throw into the garbage as normal.    Hope this helps!"

Whether we like it or not we live in an incredibly well armed society, and high powered rifles are relatively ubiquitous. I do find that there is value in the police having access to armored vehicles of this type in the event of a shooting, or more relevantly some sort of armed standoff.  Having access to enough armor to be relatively safe should in theory allow the police to defuse situations without having to resort to lethal force straight away.  Of course there are plenty of cases where vehicles like this have been abused by the forces who posses them, and there is nothing like a guarantee that this will not be the case in the future, but the focus should be on establishing a doctrine where the use of these sorts of vehicles is rare and extraordinary not necessarily on removing them altogether."
madisonwi,39q947,MelkorDCLXVI,19,Sat Jun 13 22:12:30 2015 UTC,"The problem is, the people and communities who are victims of police abuse are exactly the ones who have the least say in how the department operates.  Not every police officer is corrupt or power-hungry. Not every police officer is prejudiced. But when your methodology is based around ensuring order through superior firepower, marginalization and oppression are a natural result."
madisonwi,39q947,PearlClaw,0,Sat Jun 13 22:30:06 2015 UTC,"In a lot of ways it is important for the Police to be able to escalate when necessary, which is the logic behind the existence of SWAT teams and riot gear. I consider the ability to escalate to be a mostly separate issue from institutional culture, which is where a lot of the problems lie.   Police forces can be just as oppressive with revolvers and billy clubs as with military uniforms and armored vehicles, as anyone who lived through the civil rights era could tell you. The approach to policing matters more than the tools and the causation today seems to be running from methods to equipment not the other way around, in the sense that for the most part police policy leads to escalation not so much the ability to escalate becoming a self fulfilling need.  Perhaps I have it backwards but from what I have seen occurring both historically and recently this is how it seems to me.  My argument is that it makes a lot more sense to spend time and effort worrying about how to give those victims of police abuse the ability to assert themselves and to work on oversight systems (body cameras and the like) than to fight hardware acquisitions.   Now on the other hand if the Madison Police decided to acquire a fleet of these vehicles (afaik they just have the one right now, yes?)I would be altogether on your side in condemning it as unnecessary, dangerous, and not to mention wasteful."
madisonwi,39q947,MelkorDCLXVI,2,Sat Jun 13 22:54:57 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that a single armored vehicle isn't the end of the world. I understand that you're worried about potential dangerous situations where a strong response is necessary.  But no matter how much hardware the police have, they can't be everywhere and prevent every instance of harm. Even giving the MPD the benefit of the doubt and assuming that their motives are entirely good-hearted, I believe that we have long since passed the point of diminishing returns with respect to force. I think that given the current atmosphere, the MPD's top priority should be fostering trust with the community, which will prevent far more violence in the long term."
madisonwi,39q947,PearlClaw,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:37:45 2015 UTC,Absolutely. My comment was mostly a response to the various snarky commentary about how unnecessary or stupid vehicles like this are. I in no way wanted to say that this should be MPD's biggest concern right now.

The police aren't fighting an organized militia, they are almost universally targeting a single individual.  The idea of needing military equipment to quell ""riots"" seems to actually lead to the crowds more heavily arming themselves.  If you need military tactics, you need the military, not the police."

Here's a few that aren't on it:  1) VIP - I like them a little more than the Chinese restaurants you've mentioned. Get the Chinese menu, not the sushi/American one.  2) Minerva - Goat briyani, Hyderabadi chicken dum biryani (can ask for it real spicy), all the dosa = must try. Also go for the tandoori stuff.  3) Asian Sweet Bakery - They have a little corner with tables and you can order cooked food. Menu isn't super extensive, but it's fun and different from the usual restaurant. The baked goods are fresher/better than the stuff stores bring in from Chicago."

madisonwi,39qeuc,madman86,1 point,Sun Jun 14 05:45:15 2015 UTC,"I order different stuff at VIP each time - they're pretty good all round, so you could probably start by ordering whatever dishes you normally do at Chinese restaurants.

Plus, Madison is a ""foodie"" city, so those with places that don't serve good food don't last long."

madisonwi,39qeuc,name_with_a_y,2,Sun Jun 14 06:11:30 2015 UTC,"Check out Bunky's Cafe on Atwood. It's a super funky place with a great atmosphere, and a decent variety of Mediterranean dishes. The first time I went there, the owner herself was hostessing and really imparted her enthusiasm onto us. The environment is really upbeat and casual for being somewhat dimly lit at night, and I've always had a great time there. Large portions, too, so there's always some to take home.   Also in that general area, Tex Tubb's Taco Palace. They have many different varieties at a self-serve salsa bar. It's no Torchy's, but it's the closest thing to a quality Austin taco spot that I've found in Wisconsin.   For Indian food, I'd go to Swad on Monona Drive. Nothing extraordinarily unique about it, but it's everything you'd look for in an Indian restaurant.   The Dumpling Haus in Hilldale did not disappoint, but a meal consisting of dumplings seemed only appropriate as a precursor to walking over to the Sundance Cinema and watching a movie with a couple of beers, and I wouldn't tell you to go to the Dumpling Haus if that was your only motivation to go to Hilldale.   Just the other night we checked out Ha Long Bay on Willy. The menu is very, very large and has many different types of East Asian cuisine, but thankfully they have a House Specialties section which is my favorite way to conquer indecision at a new place. I was not disappointed, and the wontons were actually delicious (some places I have to wonder if they were just ordered frozen from a supplier, but I did not get that impression here).   There's also that tiny Laotian place near Umami (which itself is a great place to eat; get some pork buns with your ramen). I like to think I have a decent tolerance for spicy food, but that Laotian place really had me sweating for a little bit. That was also a good time, and the beer from Laos was worth trying.   ... Jeez. I didn't realize I had so much to say about this. Anyway, let me know what you think of any of those places if you end up going to them!"

I also am a big fan of Bird's Ruins in Marshall. Free to play, and great mix of elevation, wooded, and longer shots. The most diverse course in the area.  Elver and Token are also really good courses. They both get lots of traffic, so you might get slower play, but both offer some good holes.

madisonwi,39lcka,n609mike,14,Fri Jun 12 15:16:53 2015 UTC,You can't build anything in Madison without pissing someone off.
madisonwi,39lcka,Sargos,7,Fri Jun 12 16:10:02 2015 UTC,"That is why so many people want to move here. Residents give a shit, show up to planning meeting and pass around petitions. If you want a place where nobody gives a shit that not hard to find. They are called suburbs."
madisonwi,39lcka,slayerhk47,6,Fri Jun 12 18:29:27 2015 UTC,Obviously no building in Madison should be over two floors and the population should be capped at 15k.  /s
madisonwi,39lcka,belandil,2,Fri Jun 12 17:35:54 2015 UTC,"I understand pushback from trying to get past the quasi-official height limit, like during the Constellation construction (Why do all these apartment builds need names?  It must be a form of marketing).  However, I support that because it helps preserve views of the Capitol and overall feel of the city.  This give you something like 12 floors, which is plenty.  I've been to Trenton, NJ where the Capitol is obstructed by most downtown buildings and it's a bit of a shame."
madisonwi,39lcka,belandil,7,Fri Jun 12 17:57:38 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this is ridiculous NIMBYism.  This building is replacing the old dairy that was there, which is now an empty lot.  It's right next to a clinic on the corner of two arterial streets.   “The amount of traffic that this generates versus what’s on Park Street is really fairly insignificant,” said architect Randy Bruce at Monday’s Plan Commission meeting.   Duh.     including a desire for no late-night restaurant    Park Street is kind of a dumpy neighborhood.  A project like this can help revitalize things.  Park street has plenty of other restaurants (several open late) so I doubt this would change things.  Mixed use is wonderful and should be used in many other places.  If anything, residents might be against this as it's going to make the neighborhood more desirable and raise rent, leading to possible gentrification.  But then again, gentrification an almost unavoidable consequence of urban renewal.  The alternative is to let the area continue to slide.  Requiring some low-rent units might help a bit, but I expect the new apartments will be ""luxury"" as that's about all that's built in Madison these days."
madisonwi,39lcka,belandil,6,Fri Jun 12 17:53:54 2015 UTC,"You seem to have not visited Park St lately. I would say it was kind of dumpy 5+ years ago. Its pretty much been the focus of development since then. St MArys renovation, Ideal, Lanes, Dunkin, this site, across Fish Hatchery, the Mason, barriques, MATC is looking to move right by it. And many others projects in the immediate area. It is right for the residents to demand quality development. If they dont developers build the lowest quality allowed by code."
madisonwi,39lcka,madisonthrow,4,Fri Jun 12 18:26:55 2015 UTC,I'm familiar with Park Street.  What about this proposal do you think is low quality?
madisonwi,39lcka,eyncognito,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:16:37 2015 UTC,From your previous comment its clear you are not familiar with the area. I didn't say it was low quality or not. The residents did.

madisonwi,39my3s,ScottWalkerSucks,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:42:54 2015 UTC,I thought you meant for the whole car.  Most places want 3-4k to wrap a car with a standard 1 color vinyl.  It's a lot of work.

The Engineering ramp has multiple levels and may not have an elevator, so if stairs are an issue the police lot (16) is probably best.

The bus stops on State St are a little ridiculously close together, but this means either the bus will stop one block before that stop or just around the corner.  In which case... if the bus shelter magically attracts ""bad"" people, then why does the city thing they won't just start hanging out at those bus stops?"
madisonwi,39cbbw,layer555,26,Thu Jun 11 05:04:58 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't believe this, or removing the philosopher's stones, will address, resolve, or even impact the issue. State street is just a hub for people, and as the local economy declines, a hub for crime and the homeless. The money our city will spend on this project would be better spent addressing the quality of life for people loitering in this area.  Imo this is not only a cop out solution, but pandering to whatever construction firm will be profiting from the endeavor."

The STATE economy might be, but Dane co, and specifically the Madison area, is doing pretty well. That doesn't mean there isn't a significant homeless problem in Madison, but I think that reflects bad priorities, not a bad economy. So long as Madison continues to try to MOVE the problem instead of take it head on and SOLVE it, the problem will do just that, move around."
madisonwi,39cbbw,aertime,17,Thu Jun 11 16:01:47 2015 UTC,Madison redeveloped Peace Park and all the homeless folks moved to Philosopher's Grove.   Now the city is going to repurpose that area? Putting a bandaid on homelessness isn't going to fix anything.  Great work Soglin...
madisonwi,39cbbw,_stonecoldsaidso,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:37:33 2015 UTC,Soglin is an asshole that doesn't care about the poor or disadvantaged of Madison. Most of his plans and policies focus on getting more for the people that already have more (e.g. fiber plan vs. wifi plan).

From the article: ""Although no final decision has been made, removing the bus shelter could also bring side benefits, including better timing for Metro buses that wouldn’t have to stop and get trapped by red lights at the top of State Street, opening more sidewalk space in a “pinched” area near the shelter, and opening space for a venerable restaurant to create a sidewalk cafe, city officials said.""  It directly helps bus riders so that they aren't picked up and dropped off in the middle of area with many nuisance bums.  Instead, the bus stop will be moved around the corner to a safer location."

madisonwi,39c6ks,MSACCESS4EVA,-6,Thu Jun 11 20:30:28 2015 UTC,Perhaps you should try reading the posts in order.
madisonwi,39bt8s,AdoptMaddieDC,2,Wed Jun 10 18:27:10 2015 UTC,"I think you're doing the best thing here, however it is unfortunate to hear that the humane society in which she's currently being fostered out of is ready to euthanize her. That sickens me actually. Leash reactivity is workable though it is a project, however very rewarding.   Please check Wisconsin humane societies and their fostering programs to see if they will take her, along with reaching out to Wisconsin residents. Maybe you already did this but Wisconsin is pretty great when it comes to humane societies. Dane County, Elmbrook, Racine, Ozaukee... To name a few. HAWS also has a wonderful rehabilitation center; they are in Waukesha. However, I don't know if they are listed as no kill like the rest but most wisconsin shelters have a low kill rate.   Good luck! I would take her but I currently have my own project monster :)"
madisonwi,39bt8s,Nabooru_13,2,Wed Jun 10 19:33:12 2015 UTC,"Oooo. We have her listed on Dane County's humane society website and I skipped over Milwaukee (they have their hands full), but I will reach out to Elmbrook, Racine, and Ozaukee. I did not know that the WI shelters have a low kill rate (the rate out here in 2004 was about 40% save, 60% ...)."
madisonwi,39bt8s,Unicorn_Cavalry,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:37:40 2015 UTC,"Dane County Humane Society will not work with dogs that are not dog-friendly. They will euthanize them. Unsure of other societies, but DCHS would not be the way to go in this case. A rescue would probably be a better option.  I also own and love a dog-reactive dog who loves people, and I wish you the best of luck in your search!"
madisonwi,39bt8s,madman86,2,Thu Jun 11 00:16:19 2015 UTC,We've only got her advertised on the DCHS site. DCHS will not be taking Madison into their direct care.  Thanks for the support!
madisonwi,39bt8s,SuperBeaver,2,Thu Jun 11 11:37:34 2015 UTC,"For those interested in this dog, but worried about the reactivity, I would suggest Dog Face training. They helped my lab become much better about barking at people. Genie (the owner) is an awesome trainer.   We did Focus and Confident, which requires a leash/harness, so probably not appropriate for Madison, but I'm sure they can help you out. I cannot recommend them enough."
madisonwi,39am08,mcq76,13,Wed Jun 10 13:20:34 2015 UTC,I would be interested in playing as well.   Let's start a Reddit soccer team!!
madisonwi,39am08,lapekes,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:24:45 2015 UTC,I suck at sports but I'd totally come to games if we had a soccer team. Us versus /r/milwaukee?
madisonwi,39am08,name_with_a_y,4,Thu Jun 11 00:06:22 2015 UTC,Keva and breakaway have rec/social soccer leagues and both I believe allow for singles to sign up to get placed on a team.
madisonwi,39am08,fease,2,Wed Jun 10 16:53:10 2015 UTC,I've done Keva and it sucks if you don't have a team of your own. Signing up on your own is unpleasant.  Has anyone signed up and played at Breakaway?
madisonwi,39am08,1htaehn,2,Wed Jun 10 19:45:45 2015 UTC,I did the same thing and it sucked pretty bad.
madisonwi,39am08,FranciscoBizarro,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:21:51 2015 UTC,"I played Breakaway for three weeks. I'm done for the season with a shoulder and knee injury. Turns out, those guys are just as insanely aggressive as the ones at Keva.  Do you know of any other options? I keep playing in ""recreational"" leagues where everyone else thinks they're in the world cup."
madisonwi,39am08,1htaehn,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:33:23 2015 UTC,"Sounds like I had a similar experience to yours - I sprained my ankle horribly at Keva, although that was just a freak accident (not due to anyone's aggression), and I haven't played since.  Unfortunately, my Googling doesn't turn up a lot of options around town besides Keva and Breakaway.  I'm wondering if there might be small rec systems that don't have an online presence, but are maybe just word of mouth?  I did just become old recently, so I'm considering trying out Keva again as the youngest player in the 30+ rec league and seeing if that slows things down for me.  You probably don't qualify for that option though :/"
madisonwi,39am08,FranciscoBizarro,2,Mon Jul 6 15:30:48 2015 UTC,"I did think about that - or I could try the C-league instead of the B-league at Keva. Maybe try indoor instead of outdoor. I do have another 4.5 years before I'll be eligible for the 30+ crowd, but I'm looking forward to it."
madisonwi,39am08,1htaehn,3,Mon Jul 6 15:33:55 2015 UTC,I played in Verona last year at Redden Park. 3 tiers of competition on artificial turf. I played the middle tier and it was a bit more competitive than I anticipated. I can't remember who hosted the league though
madisonwi,39am08,MyDeadbeatUncle,2,Wed Jun 10 14:47:56 2015 UTC,"http://www.meetup.com/theadventurers/ has a soccer meetup every Wednesday night that is semis competitive but a good way to start and meet people.  I also run an indoor / 7 v 7 outdoor team at breakaway sports. We play Thursday nights now, first game is next week @ 545. PM me if interested. We could use a few subs."
madisonwi,39am08,aarondamaster,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:30:43 2015 UTC,There is always pick up games every day around 5pm at university bay fields. meet some people there and work your way up I guess.
madisonwi,39am08,2highforthis,1 point,Thu Jun 11 09:08:01 2015 UTC,"There's a pretty big group that meets at 4PM on Sundays in Wingra Park for a pick up game. Definitely isn't competitive, they don't even keep score. The skill and age level varies, but it's decent soccer. They are very friendly and welcome any and all to play."
madisonwi,39am08,striker38976,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:08:42 2015 UTC,"I know Keva has leagues, can't comment on how competitive they are though. http://www.kevasports.com/pricing-tables/soccer-leagues Looks like there's a free agent tab on that page if he wants to get added to a team."
madisonwi,39am08,Amukka,2,Wed Jun 10 14:14:23 2015 UTC,"Yep, Keva has a range of leagues at different skill levels and you can sign up as a free agent.  I'd start there.  Outdoor co-ed leagues just started, but you may be able to get on a free-agent team or have them direct you to a team that might still need a few players."
madisonwi,39am08,ron0404,2,Wed Jun 10 14:48:56 2015 UTC,Keva is as competitive as it gets for open play. I played varsity in high school and got schooled at the Keva rec league.
madisonwi,39am08,aarondamaster,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:32:28 2015 UTC,Breakaway is pretty competitive too. I played in the adult coed rec league all winter and almost all the teams were composed of experienced players. There is no MUFA rec D equivalent for soccer around here.   The free agent team at breakaway seemed friendly if you are willing to play in a slightly competitive environment.
madisonwi,39ehwd,TuckerGrover,5,Thu Jun 11 04:57:18 2015 UTC,We have Unity UW Health and like it. Came from Dean.
madisonwi,39ehwd,madman86,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:20:02 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, Unity isn't an option. Dean is the cheapest that I've seen and we're leaning toward a Blue Cross Blue Shield plan that might allow us to use Meriter."
madisonwi,39ehwd,Mswindupbird89,2,Fri Jun 12 01:46:48 2015 UTC,"My personal favorite has been Physicians Plus/UW Health (which would include Meriter).  I recently signed up for insurance at my job and I was given a booklet with each insurance ranked based on dozens of different standards.  I'm sure you'd be able to find something like that online and choose which sounds best.  The only one I wouldn't recommend is Dean.  Every time I had insurance with Dean I was never happy with it, and I know a few people who went with Dean and found their doctors to be negligent to the point of putting their lives at risk.  If I remember correctly, they were the lowest ranked in that little booklet I got."
madisonwi,39ehwd,tasunder,3,Thu Jun 11 05:17:32 2015 UTC,"As a counterpoint, the best doctors I've ever had were from Dean, and the worst were from GHC.  Had decent experience with Unity docs. I think it really depends on the doctor and clinic. My GHC doc gave extremely bad medical advice - like, so bad that I don't know how he got his medical license. But the PAs there were fine.   One clinic that a lot of people love (I've only done PT there and loved it) is Wildwood. I think they take multiple insurances."
madisonwi,39ehwd,Mswindupbird89,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:07:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing. We have an OPM website to help us compare plans, but it's really overwhelming. Knowing to avoid Dean is really helpful. Thanks!"
madisonwi,39ehwd,Kurtze,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:24:12 2015 UTC,The physicians plus plan I see for me will cost about $600/month. Pretty pricey. Geez.
madisonwi,39ehwd,n609mike,2,Thu Jun 11 05:40:29 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, they're also one of the most expensive.  I forgot that since I now pay a flat rate regardless of which insurance I have with the job I have now.  I didn't mean to say that others aren't an option, just... still wouldn't recommend Dean.  And I seem to recall that besides Dean being ranked the lowest, the other options all seemed to generally be rated around the same."
madisonwi,39ehwd,Atherial,-4,Thu Jun 11 06:02:56 2015 UTC,You obviously have never had insurance. $600? It's cheap.
madisonwi,39ehwd,AdrienneBS,2,Thu Jun 11 16:23:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the assumption, but I have had insurance a few times. However, in the past I was only provided an option or two and paying for only myself. Now I have many options (about 30) to choose from, will be paying for a family plan, and don't really know the area as I'm new here. Nonetheless, I appreciate your input."
madisonwi,39cdao,layer555,6,Wed Jun 10 20:33:17 2015 UTC,"If you're willing to drive the 10-12 minutes Spring Harbor has been awesome. We have two cats and a dog, all of whom are cared for at Spring Harbor."
madisonwi,39cdao,madman86,3,Wed Jun 10 21:15:07 2015 UTC,"I have an italian greyhound. We thought he was was starting to develop a seizure disorder in the year leading up to our move to Madison. My fiancée and I have always found and retained good vets, but when we got here we went to spring harbor and talked about the next step in preventing his seizures they suggested an allergy test based on research the vet did prior to our first visit (after we called to make the apt and had his file sent over) instead of just starting the meds like our previous vet had wanted to do.   We had been feeding him chicken and he was allergic. So now we have special food/treats and he is a happy, healthy doggie without any seizures / skin irritation.   I also referred a co-worker to spring harbor for their dog who wouldn't stop chewing his fur and he ended up being allergic to the landscaping the dog was rolling in.   I drive to them from the west side by M and PD. It's roughly 20 minutes away with some traffic.   I don't get a kick back from them, I swear.  They just saved me from putting my dog on some serious drugs that would have ruined his life by just going the extra mile. I recommend them to anyone who needs a vet."

If you're in the ""family campground"" you'll be stacked every 50ft or so with other tents.

madisonwi,398dtx,oflowo,24,Wed Jun 10 00:13:11 2015 UTC,Johnson is kind of a nightmare to ride on. The bike lane disappears for a few blocks and you have to cross all lanes of traffic if you want to turn right.
madisonwi,398dtx,layer555,9,Wed Jun 10 07:08:39 2015 UTC,"And people park slightly in the bike lane, and trucks will park there to unload stuff, and I don't want to get doored, and sometimes people have to turn right..."

madisonwi,398dtx,layer555,10,Wed Jun 10 19:48:38 2015 UTC,"Doesn't help that the bike lane is on the left, either.  Just counter-intuitive."
madisonwi,398dtx,MSACCESS4EVA,12,Wed Jun 10 13:15:45 2015 UTC,Actually it is safer for the bicyclist to be on the left side of the road on a one way street. You drive a car or big truck from the left and it is easier to judge your distance from a biker on the driver side than the passenger side. The WISDOT did not put it on the left side of a one way street just to mess with bikers.
madisonwi,398dtx,Thelamadude,3,Wed Jun 10 13:26:24 2015 UTC,Thank you for that explanation. I've always wondered about that. Makes me wish it was like that on Gorham as well. I guess  there's only so much room to work with.
madisonwi,398dtx,MadChris,2,Wed Jun 10 15:13:52 2015 UTC,I'm lucky on the right turn aspect. I'm going east of the river so I just ride until I hit a red light on Johnson.
madisonwi,398dtx,spartandudehsld,19,Wed Jun 10 13:27:40 2015 UTC,I prefer to ride on E. Mifflin over E. Johnson.
madisonwi,398dtx,aertime,7,Wed Jun 10 02:41:14 2015 UTC,"I don't, it has a ton of stop signs. I don't understand why it's okay to suggest bikes take a less convenient route but if you're in a car and you lose 60 seconds of time, it's a huge hassle.  I'd prefer the cars took East Wash instead of East Johnson, but it sounds ridiculous if I say that out loud."
madisonwi,398dtx,MadChris,3,Wed Jun 10 13:30:02 2015 UTC,"I actually prefer to drive on Mifflin as well, especially during construction/rush hour/whenever the Isthmus is full of tourists who only know the main streets."
madisonwi,398dtx,Visceralrealism,6,Wed Jun 10 19:52:28 2015 UTC,I would be very surprised if it was even 60 seconds slower as a cyclist.  E Johnson has stoplights and there are only a few stop signs on Mifflin and almost never any sort of traffic obstructions.
madisonwi,398dtx,tasunder,4,Wed Jun 10 15:42:51 2015 UTC,I prefer it because I feel safer.
madisonwi,398dtx,aertime,5,Wed Jun 10 14:20:07 2015 UTC,That's a good point. It probably is objectively safer.
madisonwi,398dtx,MadChris,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:14:48 2015 UTC,"The stop signs suck, but the street is specifically designated for bike traffic, and I would much rather deal with stop signs than Johnson st traffic. There are large sections of E Mifflin where there are almost no cars."
madisonwi,398dtx,chriswalkeninmemphis,3,Thu Jun 11 16:14:33 2015 UTC,"I prefer to ride on whichever street has the least steep incline and will get me where I am going the quickest. Usually, this is a designated bike path, but if it isn't... Eh, I pay taxes and I can use whichever road I want.  That being said, please people - take out your headphones when you are riding in traffic. I don't wear headphones when I'm driving a car because it's stupid and dangerous, why would I do it when I'm on a bike?"
madisonwi,398dtx,nifty_lobster,4,Wed Jun 10 13:06:55 2015 UTC,"Agreed!  Around 3:30-4 in the afternoon when I'm riding home east I find Johnson to be way faster between Wisconsin Ave and Tenney Park , but that's because I can keep up with or surpass the pace of traffic so it's green lights all the way.  Usually I finally hit a red right before Tenney, which is where the bike lane ends anyways so I jump over to E. Mifflin."
madisonwi,398dtx,MadPhoenix,3,Wed Jun 10 16:33:32 2015 UTC,"I go back and forth on the headphones thing...at this point I use them to listen to books or podcasts on my daily (bike) commute. I think I have as good or better hearing with earbuds + audiobooks at a reasonable volume than a driver in a car with closed windows + radio. Also, it is totally legal to drive a car with a radio loud enough to block out all car noises, and we allow the hearing impaired to drive.  But at the same time cars are dangerous enough to cyclists that it's probably best to take every possible precaution."

madisonwi,398dtx,MaxmumPimp,15,Wed Jun 10 03:08:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, actually there are significant portions of E.

Use Mifflin- it's actually got Bike Boulevard signs, speed bumps to keep traffic slow, and much less traffic. Win-win-win."

Doesn't make it any less of a dick move nor any less unsafe.  Madison has great bike infrastructure, and when people ride in the traffic lanes instead of using a perfectly good bike lane, path, or bike boulevard a block over, everyone loses. Obviously there are times when you need to take a traffic lane--turns, going somewhere on that block, etc. but riding continuously in a traffic lane on Johnson or Willy St is stupid. Just because I'm allowed to ride in the traffic lane (which, actually, adjacent to a bike lane I'm not) doesn't make me any less dead when a texting driver bumps into me.  And you actually can't use any lane you want. 346.80(2)(a), Stats. requires bicyclists not keeping up with traffic to ride ""as close as practicable to the right-hand edge or curb of the unobstructed traveled roadway"" unless passing, turning left, or avoiding a hazard."

madisonwi,398dtx,new-money,3,Wed Jun 10 13:24:33 2015 UTC,"It's because there is no good lane to drive in. In the left, you can get caught behind a turning vehicle. In the right, parked cars.

UW Health friend likes it.  Edit - I should explain.  From what my friend says, Dean isn't super professional, management sucks and there's lots of gossip and general unpleasantness.  I have no idea how the pay or benefits differ.  But in my opinion, Deans actual healthcare blows and would recommend UW Health insurance over them any day."
madisonwi,397ihi,Mswindupbird89,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:24:38 2015 UTC,"I have worked for both and working for UW is far better. Dean is much more corporate and has many more small, petty rules that you have to go by. They just merged with St Mary's and with that came a ton of new regulations and red tape. The administration at Dean seem like they could care less about their employees, especially office staff, which is my position.   There are better benefits and much more freedom, not to mention friendlier and more competent coworkers at UW health. They have cutting edge technology that Dean just can't match. Service to patients is better at Dean, but that is because they don't see as many patients and only deal with smaller and less complicated cases.   Without a doubt, UW Health is a far better place to work for. Dean is by no means horrible, but it is just not up to par after working for the UW. I felt like I was making a much larger difference for my community and for patients when I was working for UW."

madisonwi,3964xc,tasunder,2,Tue Jun 9 17:55:40 2015 UTC,"Side note... from what I can gather based on my times there, they don't really modify the spicyness for you like most places (i.e. they won't ask how spicy or have a 1-4 star scale) -- or at least, prefer not to.  I consider this a ""plus"" but I can tolerate pretty spicy food."

madisonwi,391j24,_stonecoldsaidso,-17,Mon Jun 8 18:54:57 2015 UTC,I'm just saying it's kind of discriminates against people who prefer to ride without them. I think it's pretty unfair.
madisonwi,391j24,layer555,14,Mon Jun 8 21:35:35 2015 UTC,"Eh, I've thought about that but what else can they do?   If they just give a card or let people have the sticker on a wallet, they could use it any time whether they're biking or not. Of course even now you could just carry the helmet but I think that is enough of an inconvenience to discourage most abuse. Alternatively you could stick it on your bike, but most businesses probably don't want people hauling bikes inside.   The helmet seems like a good compromise. It's not perfect but it works. And it encourages helmet use which is good. I don't see anything wrong with wearing a helmet."
madisonwi,391j24,_stonecoldsaidso,-3,Mon Jun 8 21:41:35 2015 UTC,"I'm trying not to turn this into a helmet debate. So I'm going to avoid my feelings about that subject. Believe me, I could spend all day talking about helmet culture.  Other than that you raise solid points. There's no real way to prove you rode your bike either way. So ultimately there's no winning. On the bright side the real benefits of cycling are the fun and fitness it provides, saving a buck or 2 on a burger is a benefit I'm willing to forego."
madisonwi,391j24,layer555,3,Mon Jun 8 23:47:29 2015 UTC,"One thing I'd be interested in seeing is some sort of coordination between bicycle registration and bicycle benefits. I don't know how it'd work with being a nonprofit and the state working together, but if you could somehow include bicycle benefits with the official bicycle registration I think you'd see an increase in state registrations and bicycle benefit usage. It would be beneficial to all cyclists, boosting official numbers and including more people in the benefits."
madisonwi,391j24,_stonecoldsaidso,15,Tue Jun 9 03:38:24 2015 UTC,"It discriminates against those who are stupid about their safety?  Well, I think that's a perfectly fine discrimination to have."

Especially with something so minor that affects others safety in no way, I feel it's pretty shitty to discriminate against them.  But hey this is Madison right? We take our elitism pretty seriously.  Keep in mind you're basically saying it's okay to discriminate against people who do things you don't like, which is profoundly not okay."

I've met plenty of cyclists that aren't elitist jerks; For instance homeless people. Anyways we'll probably both disappear into our own assholes if we go further with that argument.  Coming full circle here I hate that I'm treated as lesser cyclist than others because I choose to ride without a helmet, I hate that I'm unable to benefit from programs designed to encourage riding because I simply choose comfort over safety, and most importantly I hate that people who have no understanding of physics and/or brain trauma judge me based on prolific ignorance and fear.

That's one of the selling points of eating at restaurants, fyi.   Also, you mention the steaks are $50 and mediocre in  a later comment. A quick search of their menu online reveals only two of the steaks appoach $50, a 28 oz. bone in ribeye and a 20 oz. bone in tenderloin, both of which are $49, come with soup/salad + side, something that I don't think a lot of steakhouses do. However their filet and New York Strip are $35, which is... well if you go to steakhouses, you'll know how good of a deal that is."
madisonwi,391j24,tasunder,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:22:18 2015 UTC,"I was talking about a cooked whole rotisserie chicken.  They are like $4-7 depending on the grocery store and taste better than the chicken I've had at most supper clubs / steakhouses.    Yeah, some of the steaks are ""reasonably"" priced compared to other steakhouses in Madison, but that is an extremely low bar.  No one sings praises of most Madison steakhouses so the fact that they do for Tornado means it should actually be legitimately tasty at that price (it isn't).  The $50 filet (which you omitted) at Tornado is mediocre.  So is the NY Strip.  The only entree I wasn't disappointed by was the pork w/ tart cherries."
madisonwi,391j24,potentpotablesplease,2,Tue Jun 9 17:48:01 2015 UTC,"What praises are people singing about any Madison restaurants, then? Because I've heard quite a few people rave about Tornado Room's steaks, and even enjoyed a few myself. Is it Gibson's? No. But Gibson's is nationally renowned. Doesn't mean that every steakhouse in Madison is shit.   Also, reconsulting the menu, I realize I omitted a $47 14 oz. filet... must be what you're referring to. Why is that any worse than the 8 oz.? it's just a larger size. Either way, personally I prefer strips or bone-in steaks, as I find they have more flavor. Haven't tried the pork, but the Venison was recommended to me by my server the last time and damn was that good."
madisonwi,391j24,tasunder,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:08:06 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's any worse than the 8oz;  never tried the 8oz.  To bring this full circle, I'd say if you are looking for a tasty steak at a reasonable price, the ~$25  Steak Frites at both Brasserie V and Sardine are quite tasty and a much better value than any steakhouse that I can think of in Madison.  I am sure there are even cheaper and still tasty examples in other restaurants as well (perhaps even the late night Sirloin at Tornado which probably would taste a lot better after the $20 worth of drinks you'd have saved getting that instead of the 8oz filet)."
madisonwi,391j24,tasunder,-6,Tue Jun 9 18:28:40 2015 UTC,Disagree.  Tornado Club is one of the most overrated restaurants in Madison.

I'm going to be building a new garage and have lots of plants the could go to a good home rather than just being cut down. I can help you dig them up and am available most week nights after 530 or so on the east side right by Olbrich Park.   Plants available:    Variegated ribbongrass (perfect plant for adding a dose of color anywhere you don't want to maintain; it's a fast-spreading variety perfect for covering slopes and other areas. It earned its common name because the green leaves are beautifully striped in creamy white. Variegated ribbongrass thrives in just about every garden situation from full, hot sun to shade. (In shade, it spreads a lot more slowly.) It also doesn't mind wet or dry soil. Cinnamon ferns (Tall and elegant, these ferns look great during the spring and summer months thanks to their green fronds, but also in fall and winter when their upright reproductive fronds stand in the snow. They are excellent in damp soils and look especially at home beside ponds and streams. They may colonize large areas.) Periwinkle Vinca ground cover (Glossy leaves, stellar blue flowers, quick coverage -- periwinkle is an ideal coverage for shade. Keep the plants cut back to encourage bushy growth, and to keep them within bounds. Periwinkle can become invasive.) Hosta divisions (several different varieties, for shady to partial shady areas) Lily of the Valley (Tiny lily of the valley sends up its lovely little sprays of bell-like white or pale pink flowers each spring. Allow it to spread a little (which it does, so much that it can be a problem) and it will perfume the whole area with its distinctive scent. It also makes adorable, tiny bouquets. It makes a good groundcover in small areas. Lily of the valley prefers shade and moist soil. In sunny or dry conditions, its leaves will brown. It can easily become invasive, so it's smart to put it in an area where it will be difficult to spread too far, such as a blocked in by a driveway or sidewalk.) Random other partial sun plants whose names I don't know. Basically if you come over to get something listed above but are interested in more things, I'll happily help dig up some divisions. My garden is very mature so it has lots that are able to be shared."

Generally speaking the lakes in the area are as followed:   Wingra: Small Bluegill, easiest place to catch Musky, very very weedy, has a swimming beach and a lot of people will be out in the summer in canoes, kayaks and paddleboards.  Mendota: Has some ridiculously high length restrictions on Pike, which has resulted in making it a serious pike fishery. I haven't fished much here personally. Also you can catch some nice sized catfish.  Monona: Gets choppy, but they have some great Walleyes if you can find them. Also can catch bass, Musky, nice sized bluegill, perch and crappie.  Waubesa: never really fished much there, but there's good fishing  Upper Mud: A favorite for ice fisherman, it's a bay that can net you quite a bit of panfish action, as far as I can tell it is one of the most heavily fished places in all of Madison outside of the triangles on Monona Bay.   Kegonsa: Haven't fished much there either. A few years ago their pike population was hit hard by the warm weather and they had hundreds die out, not sure if its bounced back yet though, and haven't fished it.

madisonwi,38ste5,_stonecoldsaidso,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:51:39 2015 UTC,"Disc golf fees are bullshit anyway. The only reason they exist is because the local clubs wanted to keep casual players off 'their' course.   Do you pay a fee for basketball? Tennis? No. Even cross country skiing is half the price as disc golf, and they actually provide a service by grooming trails. So what is the fee for? Nothing but purchasing exclusivity, which  is bullshit in a public park.   I pay park fees every month, it's called taxes. Until I see some actual value coming from a disc golf fee, I won't be dropping any money in the box."
madisonwi,38ste5,MadChris,2,Mon Jun 8 11:55:29 2015 UTC,"I agree to a certain point. 50 bucks for heistand and elver plus another 50 for token and cap springs seems steep. That said, look at the amount of improvement that has gone into elver and heistand (new baskets, new holes, repairs to erosion, new grass...)  Disc golf is a relatively new sport that is rising in popularity. It is not getting the funding it deserves from the parks budget so fees the fees are high. Life isn't fair. However, the courses need our support! If everyone pays the courses will get better and probably fees will go down! I hope you will consider paying in the future."
madisonwi,38ste5,_stonecoldsaidso,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:19:19 2015 UTC,"Since when have fees ever gone down? Paying fees will lead to their elimination? That's a giant leap in logic if I ever saw one.   I agree that maintenance costs money. Where I disagree is where that money should come from. For 20 years we didn't have fees. Now, the city has decided to shirk their responsibilities to the public and charge fees rather than dedicating the appropriate resources to community facilities.   A yearly trail pass for cross country skiing is $30. I find it extremely hard to believe that the disc golf courses require double the investment of a cross country ski trail system.   The fees are meant to discourage use, and they've done exactly that. I don't pay the fees, because I essentially quit playing after they decided to turn the parks into a profit center. So I guess the clubs got what they want, their own little private courses."
madisonwi,38ste5,MadChris,2,Mon Jun 8 16:30:59 2015 UTC,"Well, under the cynical assumption that this is a profit grab by the greedy parks department, the fees wouldn't go down. Are the parks even allowed to use DG fees for purposes other than upkeep of the courses? I haven't looked into this, but I would be very disappointed if that were the case.  Assuming that this is a more or less honest attempt to pay for upkeep of the courses, if more people pay the fee each person would have to pay less to meet the costs of upkeep and improvements. This could be the why ski passes are cheaper. I have often wondered how $30 for city + county covers groomed trails while it takes $100 for DG courses.

madisonwi,38oq18,new-money,8,Fri Jun 5 16:49:39 2015 UTC,Agreed. It's really nothing compared to a train or fire engine.
madisonwi,38oq18,new-money,17,Fri Jun 5 17:13:02 2015 UTC,"The difference is that it never ends. There are 4 routes that go down my street, in both directions. I'm in the middle of the block, so I'm within earshot of 4 bus stops. The sound lasts a few seconds when the bus pulls over, goes quiet while passengers board, then the sound comes back for a few seconds as it pulls away. 4 routes x 4 stops x 2 sounds per stop = 32 sounds every 10-30 minutes, or however often the buses are running depending on the time of day. I can ballpark an average of hearing this sound 100 times per hour from 6am-midnight.  I hear the sound all day, every day.  Edit: After typing that out, I realize how pointless that stupid sound is. I just irritated myself. I think I need to go for a walk."
madisonwi,38oq18,Strongman365,-2,Fri Jun 5 17:39:08 2015 UTC,Stay away from the Bus routes.

You are definitely getting great bus service, probably best I've ever heard of.  EDIT: I may have over-estimated. Divide by 2. You have 50 bus-- because the each bus makes the sound twice, once while stopping and once while departing-- going by your house per hour."

madisonwi,38oq18,joerobo,12,Fri Jun 5 18:39:30 2015 UTC,Welcome to the city where there is ambient noise.  Doesn't this person have any more real problems in their life to complain about?
madisonwi,38oq18,MadChris,7,Fri Jun 5 19:09:12 2015 UTC,"You should join the neighborhood mailing lists (which are still called ""listservs"") and hear the noise complaints. There are groups of people determined to get outdoor festivals (La Fete, Central Park Sessions, etc) to be quieter because the noise level at the edge of the festival is about equal to that of a blender or vacuum cleaner."
madisonwi,38oq18,joerobo,5,Fri Jun 5 19:49:48 2015 UTC,"Lol, we all should, and flood it with satirical and over the top complaints.  I can just imagine the outrage."

madisonwi,38oq18,Dizzy_Slip,3,Sat Jun 6 10:10:35 2015 UTC,It's a very privileged existence. How dare these buses puncture it!
madisonwi,38oq18,AberrantRambler,2,Sat Jun 6 10:21:29 2015 UTC,The article said they asked for safety data and they didn't have any - so how can you say it does reduce accidents?
madisonwi,38oq18,Dizzy_Slip,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:27:24 2015 UTC,You know those backup horns on some vehicles? Beep as they back up?  I haven't seen a single study on them but I can honestly say there's a good chance that accidents are prevented because of them.  You don't always need a study in order to assert something that seems pretty true.
madisonwi,38oq18,AberrantRambler,2,Sun Jun 7 09:58:35 2015 UTC,"You don't always need a study in order to assert something that seems pretty true.   If you just go with what seems ""pretty true"" you'll make a lot of mistakes.  The world is more complicated than that.  When spending tax dollars I'd prefer it go to things that are true instead of just seem true.  In the past two weeks I've been riding with two different drivers who were confused to heck over what was making the strange noise (it was the busses making their new noises, and this was downtown on multi-lane roads where it was not obvious exactly what was making the sound).  It seems ""pretty true"" to me that distracting drivers with strange noises isn't a good idea."
madisonwi,38oq18,ms_ashes,5,Sun Jun 7 15:50:14 2015 UTC,"There's a bus stop right outside my window. Yeah, it's annoying, but it's not that bad. My goodness.  Granted, I live only a few blocks from a fire station and I grew up in a small town (lots of farm equipment rumbling down main street) and a few blocks from a railroad track, so I learned to block outside noises pretty well. But seriously. It's not bad at all.  I find the thumping bass from my neighbors that has no given end time significantly more annoying than a minute (at most) of the bus sounds.   Edit: Though my guess is that the lady in the article possibly has misophonia and the bus sound sets it off. As someone who also struggles with misophonia, I understand her pain, as when a sound triggers mine, I get absolutely and insanely upset, but it's up to the individual to deal with sound triggers in an adult and responsible fashion and not expect the world to change for their own issues. Yeah, it would be excellent if no one ever mouthed words while reading around me or snored, but it's not their fault that they do, and it's up to me to deal with it, rather than freaking out like I'd like to do. The same goes for bus sounds. By all means, install a sound-block, but don't expect the city to change this. It's helpful for traffic issues as well as disabled bus-riders."
madisonwi,38oq18,cryogenetik,12,Fri Jun 5 17:19:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the sound of the buses is almost entirely pointless. Buses are super tall and make all sorts of noises on their own. Just because one person was hit in an area where pedestrians act stupidly all the time (I see people almost get hit on University every weekend) doesn't mean we suddenly need 'alerts' to indicate every change in direction that a bus makes.  Cars don't make BEE-WOO-BEE-WOO sounds and they're smaller, accelerate faster, and aren't driven by professionals."
madisonwi,38oq18,ms_ashes,4,Fri Jun 5 17:29:07 2015 UTC,"I honestly figure it's more for disabled folks waiting to get on the bus? But yeah, the article mentions the reasoning is for visibility in traffic. shrug I can still see the benefit to having the alerts, even if it's just a liability insurance thing."
madisonwi,38oq18,cryogenetik,4,Fri Jun 5 17:34:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah but you have to weigh benefits and costs. The overall point is that the cost is increased city noise + many residents' discomfort in their own homes, which is a fairly large cost, while the benefit is ""maybe people will see these big-ass already noisy buses better if they also beep"" with no data to back it up."
madisonwi,38oq18,Kurtze,-3,Fri Jun 5 18:07:06 2015 UTC,"Do you think there has to be a ""diagnosis"" to explain everything? Not everybody has to be a victim or go on disability for everyday shit. Perhaps she is just irritated by a constant annoying fucking sound. Jesus."
madisonwi,38oq18,ms_ashes,0,Fri Jun 5 17:54:32 2015 UTC,"No, but if it's making her life that miserable, it's likely that it's more than just irritation. :) Irritation is a normal thing. The response that misophonia invokes is way more than annoyance or irritation. It also has nothing to do with ""going on disability,"" so I'm not sure why you brought it up."
madisonwi,38oq18,tasunder,2,Fri Jun 5 17:57:51 2015 UTC,"Clearly the solution to people getting hit in a crosswalk is for vehicles to make more noise in Madison as a cue for people in crosswalks to have to decide whether to suddenly dive out of the way of vehicles that are failing to yield in crosswalks.  I believe similar logic is being used on those red crosswalks on Johnson St.  I initially thought it was to alert drivers to yield, but then realized that can't be it (0 for 20 or so on that since they were put in) and instead it's almost a subliminal message to pedestrians in the crosswalk that they are in imminent danger."
madisonwi,38oq18,Mswindupbird89,2,Fri Jun 5 18:28:22 2015 UTC,"I lived right in front of a bus stop when they first installed it.  At first I noticed it, but then you just get used to it.  I don't think it's nearly as bad as she's making it out to be, and it's been installed for awhile.  There's one woman who rides the bus (not this lady) who I see every once in awhile who goes NUTS when the noise starts going off and she gets into verbal fights with people around her and starts yelling at the bus driver like it's his fault.  I think she's probably mentally ill, or has some hypersensitive ears.  If someone has really sensitive hearing then that sucks but otherwise, suck it up.    When you live downtown, you're more likely to be woken up by drunk people screaming or someone puking in the bush than anything else."
madisonwi,38oq18,samthunder,3,Fri Jun 5 21:06:38 2015 UTC,"I was riding a very crowded bus on my way to work and standing as unobtrusively as possible.  This lady was pretty much blocking the rear doorway with no sign of getting off anytime soon.  The driver was trying to make up time and there were a lot of less-than-smooth stops and accelerations and I bumper her fingers with the edge of my triceps not once but TWICE.    She immediately lost her shit and started hitting me (and another female passenger) and telling me to stop touching her and I tried to apologize and she insisted that I was trying to cop a feel.  I moved to the front near the driver and he's like ""what the fuck is going on back there?""  The bus is never dull."
madisonwi,38oq18,Mswindupbird89,3,Sat Jun 6 00:18:04 2015 UTC,Ugh.  I really think there needs to be some kind of etiquette class before you ride the bus.  I could write a whole book on weird shit or really dumb obnoxious shit I've seen.
madisonwi,38oq18,ktourdot,2,Sat Jun 6 01:08:49 2015 UTC,"Really shocked that the driver didn't call to report her behavior and kick her off the bus.  That behavior is unacceptable and she should be banned from riding the buses.  Some riders are so inconsiderate of others.  The bus home was packed last night and there were two men who were taking up a 3 seat bench because they couldn't close their legs together to allow someone to sit down.  There was no more room to stand and these two jerks were manspreading.  Most female riders use only one seat and they usually have a purse plus a lunch bag.  If they can hold multiple bags in a small confined space, then it's really not that difficult for some man to close their legs.  Madison Metro might consider having a public service awareness campaign on bus riding etiquette.  They could address that one fare means one seat, not one seat for each leg for example."

madisonwi,38mb7v,588-2300_empire,4,Fri Jun 5 19:47:01 2015 UTC,You've got it backwards. Single bottle sales and anything smaller than a six-pack are already banned downtown. Alder Verveer and the ALRC are looking for a way to allow sales of 22oz bombers and 4-packs of craft beers as these are typically not favored by chronic alcoholics.  Riley's has been flying under the radar with their single bottle craft beer sales until now.
madisonwi,38mb7v,layer555,2,Fri Jun 5 21:39:17 2015 UTC,So I guess I wonder why they've not bothered to enforce it until this week when it was enacted in 2009.
madisonwi,38mb7v,Dizzy_Slip,2,Fri Jun 5 21:58:44 2015 UTC,A lot of ordinances are complaint-driven. The city's not out constantly checking up on all of these establishments.

madisonwi,38mb7v,madhatter2,4,Fri Jun 5 14:20:05 2015 UTC,"Or they'll buy liquor. Seriously, you can get a pint for under $4 or save roughly $7 and get a liter."
madisonwi,38mb7v,madhatter2,2,Fri Jun 5 15:32:57 2015 UTC,"It looks like individual bottles aren't exactly banned, provided that at least 6 bottles are purchased. Riley's still has its coolers with individual bottles, it just has a notice on it that you must purchase a minimum of 6 bottles during your transaction (for instance, you can buy a 4 pack and 2 singles)"
madisonwi,38mb7v,Dizzy_Slip,2,Fri Jun 5 23:13:58 2015 UTC,Looks like they are banning everything but beer and wine too.  Nevermind that there are several local distilleries whose goods are probably being sold in decent quantities around the downtown corridor.
madisonwi,38mb7v,MisterMath,2,Fri Jun 5 14:21:16 2015 UTC,"This was sent to pinkus mcbride it looks like, and they don't sell liquor anyways. I imagine liquor stores have a different type of license with different rules. Maybe this only affects downtown grocery/convenience stores?"
madisonwi,38mb7v,Dizzy_Slip,2,Fri Jun 5 14:31:32 2015 UTC,"So most of the documents I've found have applied solely to Class A Beer.

B) Alcoholics and ""problem drinkers"" will still drink and be rowdy regardless of this.  C) Small breweries and breweries that make specialty bottlings in a 22oz format will no longer be able to sell in an arbitrarily decided geographic area.  D) It sets a precedent for every other retailer in the ""non-downtown"" area to potentially not sell these products.  E) Even if the city amends this to macro beers and exempts craft beer it reeks of classism.  F) Prohibition of alcohol really just isn't going to fix anything.  G) Bars face no restrictions so people can still go out, get drunk, and then cause a scene downtown."
madisonwi,38mb7v,_stonecoldsaidso,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:36:26 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty obvious they are trying to discourage the sale of single beers to the homeless riff-raff that hang around on State St. Bars are too expensive for these types and can just kick them out when they become a problem. Liquor stores on the other hand don't have to deal with them after the sale. They just give them a brown bag and send them on their way to harass people on State St for change to buy more booze.  Yep, still don't care."
madisonwi,38mb7v,Dizzy_Slip,-18,Thu Jun 11 16:41:31 2015 UTC,Bartenders are more likely to make sure they aren't over-serving someone. A checkout guy at a liquor store doesn't care.  Sell him a beer and he walks away and causes problems elsewhere.  But over-serve someone in a particular bar and there's a record of that.

madisonwi,38mb7v,juice369,-11,Fri Jun 5 06:55:15 2015 UTC,"I misunderstood your comment. But even so-- the bar owners are actually involved in the city and contribute to the city. A brewing company miles away, not so much.  The owners of the bars are the constituents of the alders of the city council so sure they shoud address their needs.  But let's be honest....  If you can't afford a six-pack of beer,  should we really be worried about that?  Plus people buying single beers won't exactly make up a huge percentage of a bar's revenue,  even if they get driven into the bars as you claim this is about.  We are talking about people who beg for enough money to go buy a beer.  I mean seriously.  Bars aren't hurting for their business."

madisonwi,38mb7v,HammerTimeHTFU,2,Fri Jun 5 12:41:25 2015 UTC,"So, my guess is that the people you're talking about will now just buy a Pint of cheap liquor which can be found for less than $4, which while more expensive than a beer is still cheap and contains more alcohol."
madisonwi,38mb7v,Dizzy_Slip,2,Fri Jun 5 15:10:17 2015 UTC,"This week, I bought a single 12 oz bottle of Bell's planet series at Vic Pierce. It cost 3.49.

madisonwi,38r2fe,vatoniolo,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:47:09 2015 UTC,I got a ticket/towed when I was having car trouble and couldn't move out of a tow-zone in time. I contested the ticket and provided proof that I could not move the car (a receipt from about 2 hours later when my towing company finally arrived) and they dismissed it.
madisonwi,38r2fe,cuomo456,1 point,Sun Jun 7 06:47:32 2015 UTC,You're lucky they did that. You were still parked illegally and the ticket was not issued in error. Did they dismiss the tow fee?
madisonwi,38r2fe,vatoniolo,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:23:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the ticket was $90 or $95 including the tow and they dismissed the entire thing. I also called the city ahead of time and asked what to do since my tow truck wasn't able to make it before 4pm or whatever time I needed to move by. They said to just let it get towed by the city, contest the ticket afterward, and there was a good chance it would be dismissed with the proper evidence."

madisonwi,38r2fe,Dizzy_Slip,-2,Sun Jun 7 20:10:30 2015 UTC,I think you can contest the ticket itself to start the process. Then go and context the towing.  Maybe the city will give you a break on the towing?
madisonwi,38r2fe,Dizzy_Slip,-6,Sat Jun 6 04:28:41 2015 UTC,I really hope so. It doesn't make sense that the towing costs more than the ticket itself.
madisonwi,38r2fe,vatoniolo,-2,Sat Jun 6 06:00:51 2015 UTC,I just think maybe they'll go easy on you if you're not a habitual offender.
madisonwi,38r2fe,vatoniolo,-2,Sat Jun 6 06:02:21 2015 UTC,That would be really nice. I haven't gotten a ticket since last summer due to a mix-up with my landlord so if they're going on that I'll be ok.
madisonwi,38r2fe,vatoniolo,4,Sat Jun 6 06:18:25 2015 UTC,You admit to being in the wrong and somehow think they'll let you slide because you haven't gotten a ticket in a while. Pay your fine and park legally next time

madisonwi,38jr5b,vatoniolo,2,Fri Jun 5 03:50:45 2015 UTC,"For that budget you can't go wrong with any of the B&Bs downtown. My first thought was The Livingston Inn because it has lake frontage and is simply gorgeous. The Mansion Hill Inn is similarly beautiful and probably has the best location, being a couple blocks from the Children's Museum/Capitol Square. Call Hotel Rubie Marie and ask for a 3rd floor room with a lake view. I say this because those rooms are farthest from the rowdy bars downstairs. I've stayed at all three of these and they will be very accommodating.  You should also call Mendota Lake House and inquire about the toddler, as their website seems to discourage young children. I have not stayed here but it is also on the lake and very close to everything. If you have a car and don't mind dealing with parking, or if you are planning to take cabs around, you can stay farther from downtown and get a nicer room for less money. However, I would say the closer to the square you are staying, the better your experience will be."

We're guys from the Madison hackerspace Sector67 who occasionally send up high altitude balloons.

They don't even want what we have, they just don't want us to have it either and so their politicians want to destroy it.  And so much for small government, as though anyone actually believed that bullshit anymore. 'Republicans want to let the people decide what's best for them...by steamrolling local governments who most accurately represent 'the people' and overruling their authority to govern their cities as they see fit.'  On a bike ride from downtown up through Middleton and back I was actually sort of struck by how far this city has come since I moved here. There's so much nice green space, so much nice redevelopment, better restaurants and shops, etc. We consistently create more jobs than almost the rest of the state combined.

You'd think he government would look at examples of success and try to replicate them. Rest of the state needs jobs. Madison creates the most in the state.

madisonwi,38fcuq,corduroyblack,5,Thu Jun 4 17:22:13 2015 UTC,"I like to describe it more like this. Say you have a conversation with someone in a place like that and they ask where you're from. If you say 'Milwaukee' what is their response? Usually something along the lines of 'oh ok cool' or at worst some ignorant comment about how 'dangerous' it is there. You say 'Madison' and the reaction is more likely to be...odd and hard to place. And sometimes you get the 'Oh so you're one of those liberals then' which would happen nowhere else. Madison is the only place in this state where you are politically and culturally branded by the simple act of being from here. It's hard to describe how this feels to people who aren't. I definitely am made to feel out of place and, occasionally, unwelcome in some of the more rural parts of the state."

I get irritated when I basically get called a racist for daring to criticize people and pointing out that people are whining and fighting over silly issues.   The fight is over class. It's not about race. This is a tactic used by the powerful forever. Keep the lower classes fighting amongst themselves and they'll never challenge the ruling elite. Who has an interest in fostering racial divides? Certainly not poor black or white people. So why are they fighting each other?
madisonwi,38fcuq,corduroyblack,2,Fri Jun 5 16:45:07 2015 UTC,We've had conversations before. You've made your stance on race pretty clear.  For the record I don't act like a victim very much irl.

You do have to give him some credit for that.   If nothing else this article serves as a reminded to people where they will likely end up if they get evicted or have other problems.
madisonwi,38dg0f,n609mike,-2,Thu Jun 4 20:55:58 2015 UTC,"This is why CCAP sucks. You don't even have to do anything wrong for a landlord to file an eviction claim against you and then it is searchable for about 3 years. It doesn't have to have any merit to it, other landlords will use that information against you and they don't have to legally tell you so.  Last year Republicans tried to take away CCAP for things like this, but Democrats were so vocal about it was dropped in committee I believe. Information is generally good, but when someone can file any old civil lawsuit and it stays on a public record, that's bad information and unethical."
madisonwi,38dg0f,wisconsinpointer,4,Wed Jun 3 15:04:45 2015 UTC,Why would a landlord file an eviction claim against someone who did NOTHING wrong?
madisonwi,38dg0f,n609mike,4,Wed Jun 3 17:50:31 2015 UTC,"You would be surprised.  There's some of landlords who have zero understanding of the law and think that if someone so much as looks at them sideways, that's grounds for an eviction.  There's also some who will do it as retaliation, which is illegal, but extremely difficult to prove."
madisonwi,38dg0f,Mswindupbird89,7,Wed Jun 3 18:15:42 2015 UTC,"They wouldn't. If a case is frivolous, you can be sanctioned, which Dane County courts WILL do.  Retaliatory tactics are prohibited by state law and administrative code."
madisonwi,38dg0f,corduroyblack,0,Thu Jun 4 03:47:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you for responding. Some of the lawsuits are dismissed by the plaintiffs before the date. This doesn't mean they disappear from your record though.  I know what I'm talking about is against the law, but after repairs are completed and the inspector is satisfied, most of the restrictions are lifted. I have seen people get served for not paying a late fee on rent within 5 days. Also, if are late on rent by $1, they can legally file an eviction if they want you out or to blacked your eye. Most people take it because they have no other option.  This is also why I tell people that if you are going to ask for an inspector that you already have a new place lined up. Otherwise you are going to have a bad time.  But it's hard to prove that they are frivolous if it never gets in front of a commissioner and Dane County courts haven't done much with Mr. Peterson after decades of this. Don't blame me if I find your endorsement of their follow through a little hollow."
madisonwi,38dg0f,wisconsinpointer,2,Wed Jun 3 19:16:07 2015 UTC,If the action is dismissed...  The person needs to go to the scheduled hearing and request that the judge or commissioner strike it.
madisonwi,38dg0f,corduroyblack,0,Wed Jun 3 19:27:49 2015 UTC,That's if the scheduled hearing actually takes place. This has happened to me. I went. It was never held.

madisonwi,38dg0f,corduroyblack,2,Wed Jun 3 23:14:47 2015 UTC,"It's all in the eye of the beholder. That's why there are civil suits. The point being is that anyone, anytime can file a lawsuit against anyone at any time. It doesn't have to be a rational or logical decision. It can also be perpetrated by personal vengeance.   Hypothetical, tenant asks for repairs of the rental unit that s/he deem under the purview of the landlord. Landlord says no. Tenant disagrees, asks city for an inspection. City comes out, demands repairs. Landlord obliges, but pays money out of his pocket. Now tenant is a liability for possible more costly repairs. Landlord files eviction or after move out files frivolous lawsuit for vengeance. Record stays on file, and with a low vacancy rate potential new landlords will search, see a case and won't even look at the details.  I've made this claim before, when this was brought up before. People didn't believe me that this happened.  TL;DR If a landlord wants a tenant out or revenge the only recourse is eviction or other civil suit, even if late on rent by $1. Most not successful but that wasn't the goal.  Also I'm not saying all landlords do this. But I've run across quite a few who maybe don't go this far, but a couple that did. I would say my success rate for satisfactory landlords has been roughly 50%.  My tip for people in this situation: find out the phone number of the lawyer representing your past troubled landlord and give that as the contact for the housing reference. They won't tell anyone any bullshit because they actually know the law and what the ramifications are, the bad landlords don't and don't care what they say or do. Like Mr. Peterson."
madisonwi,38dg0f,wisconsinpointer,4,Wed Jun 3 23:26:37 2015 UTC,You think landlords looking up a prospective tenant on CCAP are not intellectually capable of discerning a frivolous or dismissed lawsuit versus one where a judgment is made against a tenant?
madisonwi,38dg0f,Kurtze,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:05:39 2015 UTC,"That's not what I said, nor the point of what I was saying.  But when the rental vacancy rate is at or below 2% there are a lot more applications that apartments. Landlords will whittle down that list this way. It is done, period. You may even get a straight answer from a couple of the companies, especially on the east side.  My point here is, having something on CCAP isn't as much of a deal breaker when the vacancy rate is closer to 5%."
madisonwi,38dg0f,wisconsinpointer,13,Wed Jun 3 19:13:05 2015 UTC,"When I lived on Morningside Avenue this guy was my landlord. I can't believe he's still alive.  He lived at the end of the street and had a weird front walkway with all of these mirrors so he could see if someone was walking to his front door.  His own house was a hoarder dump. I remember going there to sign the lease and having to move stacks of old newspapers off of a chair to find a place to sit.  I think the house where the front door doesn't open (mentioned in the article) was my old place. We put a fence up for the dogs with our own money.  We did all the work, bought the fence, dug the holes, and when we moved he was going to charge us for the fence if we took it with us.  There were some scary issues with the house.  Most notably, there was a leak in the living room.  We told him about it many times over the course of a few months.  We moved everything away from that wall.  One night there was a really loud zapping sound.  Water got into the wall outlet and started a small fire.  We called the fire department and they came and said it was due to water leaking.  Ray refused to believe them and said we had too many things plugged into the outlet.  We had nothing plugged into it because there had been water running down the wall for weeks. I can still hear his creepy, Phantasm voice answering the phone. That was over 15 years ago."
madisonwi,38dg0f,BBchick,10,Wed Jun 3 19:17:49 2015 UTC,"I can't believe their example of ""more serious issues"" include dated smoke alarms when deeper in the article there were actual legitimately scary situations.  The dated smoke alarm note probably applies to 80% of Madison homes.  Certainly there is a > 90% chance that if you buy a home that hasn't been sold for a few years, it has dated smoke alarms since the regulations changed a few years back.  There were a lot of more serious things to give as examples there."

Old carpets on the ground? Unkemp lawn? Dirty driveway? Since when is that the landlords responsibility?   I mean, even the mold, while gross, seems like a minor issue to me. When you're in a 75 year old wooden structure surrounded by lakes and swamp, you're gonna get some mold. Every place I've ever rented has had mold in it. And that bathroom sink is kinda gross, but it's the exact style I've seen in lots of places including the place I'm in right now. A melamine sponge and some elbow grease will make it look good as new.  This guy looks like a slumlord, but it also looks like his tenants are total slobs."

madisonwi,38dg0f,n609mike,13,Fri Jun 5 04:44:15 2015 UTC,If you tour them you can tell if its junk. If the person showing you the properties has to promise to fix large items before you move in it might be a warning sign. If the current tenant is there maybe you could try to ask them how he is at fixing stuff. Maybe knock on the door a bit after you finish touring (after the property manager is gone) and ask the current resident about them.
madisonwi,38dg0f,daycaredude,5,Wed Jun 3 14:43:39 2015 UTC,This is great advice. Definitely talk to a resident after touring the apartment. That has saved me some major headaches throughout my life.

If he wants to rent houses for less than what the market can bear to people who have credit issues, that's laudable, but if he can't or won't maintain them to code, he has no business renting those properties out."

madisonwi,38dg0f,BrujahRage,3,Wed Jun 3 16:53:32 2015 UTC,"True, but I'm kind of dismayed that he's been allowed to rent sub-standard housing for this long. Should we just turn a blind eye to his misdeeds because he's old? Maybe the city could/should work with him to help him develop an exit strategy, but he clearly has no business being in the business (and on a purely personal note, the daughter sounds like she's cut out of the same cloth, I'm happy that she's planning on leaving when he does). Letting someone rent shit-shacks to the poors isn't a solution to Madison's lack of affordable housing for low income earners."
madisonwi,38dg0f,new-money,3,Wed Jun 3 19:08:40 2015 UTC,"No, we shouldn't turn a blind eye -- and that's why he's being fined a half a million dollars, lol. The city is not going to ""work with him""... they are long past that. ""Developing an exit strategy"" might be a nice way of saying they will fine his ass until he is forced to fold. It seems like that's the route they are taking now. The article said he is appealing, but I can't see this guy wanting to continue much longer, so even if he wins his appeal he might realize it's time to call it quits. Or, perhaps the result of his appeal is agreeing to sell his properties if they waive the fine."
madisonwi,38dg0f,_stonecoldsaidso,3,Wed Jun 3 19:19:55 2015 UTC,"Peterson draws about $36,000 a month in rent from 50 of his 72 total rental units, the rest of which are not occupied, according to Peterson’s records.   So on average, $720/month. For a comparison, I'm paying $750/mo for a 2br with off street parking and a back yard. So he's not that cheap, in reality.   More than half of his tenants pay less than $500 per person, per month.   Is that really that low? You can find lots of 2bedrooms for around 1000/month on the east side. It seems like if you've got a roommate, you shouldn't be paying much more than 500/month unless it's a new luxury apartment."

madisonwi,38dxdf,paintinginacave,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:06:05 2015 UTC,It's a long standing tradition not to hold this event (and predecessors) on the 4th. I was always told it was to accommodate the small towns in the area which held their shows on the 4th. If the 4th is on a Saturday (like this year) it has always been held on the Saturday before (the 27th). It was held on the 27th in 1998 & 2009.

madisonwi,38ab0h,GeneUnit90,6,Wed Jun 3 13:30:20 2015 UTC,Sorry to hear about your vehicle. That sucks. I would guess you might need to buy from a private owner instead of a dealership. To get that low of a monthly payment you will need really good credit and a sizable down payment (trade in). Every body has their stories about the different dealerships around Madison. I have had really good luck with Russ  Darrow Kia on the west side. I will suggest staying clear of Goben Cars and  Schoepp Motors. Good luck.
madisonwi,38ab0h,daycaredude,2,Wed Jun 3 01:14:11 2015 UTC,"According to Mint, my credit score is comfortably over 700 so I think I'm alright there. I just don't know what to expect from a trade in since there are so many issues with my current car. I hadn't considered private owners yet, though. That's a possibility. Thanks!"

madisonwi,38ab0h,acarrick,2,Wed Jun 3 18:04:18 2015 UTC,I actually had a good experience at Schoepp (middleton).  However I'm still on their internet sales list.... and it makes me not want to buy another car from them.  The level of unprofessionalism in their emails gives me an aneurysm.
madisonwi,38ab0h,fact_or_opinion,3,Wed Jun 3 18:53:53 2015 UTC,"I'm a little late to the game, but I am hoping I can help...  I have been doing a lot of car research lately and what I have read is that if you have a car to trade that is in rough shape, take it to CarMax to see what they will give you for it. CarMax will lowball you on a decent car 10/10 times, but if a car has mechanical and/or safety issues, they might be able to give you a good price that might be better than a dealer trade.  That being said, I do not recommend buying a car from CarMax because of the no-haggle factor. It works for some people, but eh. I like to squeeze out those last couple of dollars. Additionally, if you sell CarMax your car, you are under no obligation to buy a car from them. Oh, and the appraisal takes like 30 minutes tops and they are definitely no-pressure.  Other than that, buying a car always seems like a gamble. I agree with people in this thread that say to not buy from Mad City Sales, Goben Cars, and Schoepp Motors. And while Capitol Auto Credit has a user in this subreddit who seems like a nice guy, their business practices seem a little questionable as things seem to be based on monthly payment rather than a final selling price. You can really get stuck paying a lot of interest that way.  You are probably going to want to buy from a private party or a reputable dealer. Good luck."
madisonwi,38ab0h,Atherial,2,Wed Jun 3 12:19:37 2015 UTC,"First, arrange financing through a credit union.  I used the UW Credit Union and they were great and really went to a lot of trouble to help me out when I needed it.  Unfortunately, there are not a lot of used cars less than $10k around in Madison and I wasn't able to find the car that I wanted here.  I ended up buying my car from Biggers Mazda down in Illinois.  Because I was buying out of state it was a bit more complicated - that's where the UW Credit Union had to do some extra stuff for me to get everything through.  A lot of the regular banks won't finance older cars or ones with a lot of miles but the UW Credit Union didn't have any problems with it.    For dealers around here, Zimbrick has always been good to my family and I'd recommend them.  They just don't have a big inventory of the cheaper cars."

Also, does the mechanic you visited also buy or sell cars? It might be worth it to get a second opinion. A lot of mechanics will exaggerate repair costs to get the owner to sell their car on the cheap and buy a new one. If your mechanic offered to buy your ""unrepairable"" vehicle, or sell you a new one, you can pretty much guarantee that they're not being completely honest with you.  Also, don't worry about monthly payments. What you need to be concerned about is interest rate and total cost of ownership. I highly recommend you visit /r/personalfinance and read some of their guides regarding buying a vehicle."

madisonwi,387ned,jwall4,7,Tue Jun 2 12:59:31 2015 UTC,"You have the best possible plan; anyone who visits madison or lives in Madison without getting a boat is doing it wrong.  Lake Waubesa is my favorite lake out of all of them.  Lake Mendota is usually colder and choppy due to it's size, Monona is great but very busy, and since it's so wide it's sometimes hard to find a nice calm area.  There's also no restaurants on Lake Monona, while Waubesa has Christie's Landing, Green Lantern, Beach House, and I think a few others.  I feel like Waubesa is great for swimming, as long as you get away from shore into deeper areas.  All of the lakes have a lot of vegetation/weeds in the shallower areas, and although I don't think they are a 'gross' I prefer not to swim in them.  For renting boats, I would contact Barr's Resort in McFarland.   As far as I know they have a small variety of rentals that sound like they'd be perfect for you.  Be sure to check out Christie's Landing, it's a lot of fun!  Beach House has great food, Green Lantern is more of an old school WI Supper Club style place.     Also, if you get a motorboat, I'd go up the river and check out the sunset near downtown Madison, and on Sundays at 6pm there is a water ski show (free!) in front of the Monona Terrace.  Cheers!"

madisonwi,387ned,MadtownMaven,3,Tue Jun 2 15:12:28 2015 UTC,"I can't think of anywhere on Waubesa that rents boats. One fun thing though is that Lake Mendota, Monona, and Waubesa are all connected (although there is a lock between Mendota and Monona), so if you get in one, you can go to all three.   The best place for a boat rental is Wingra Boats but there's are all of the paddle variety because there are no motored boats allowed on Lake Wingra. That lake is also right by the zoo, so if you are looking for other stuff to do with the kids that could be a nice option.   Brittingham Boats also does rentals and they are on Lake Monona. But they also only rent out paddle boats, nothing motored.   The only place I could find that does motored boat rentals is Skipper Buds and they are on Lake Mendota."

If the weather is decent there will be lots of boats on the lake all day and most of the night. Everything from jet skis to cigarette boats roaring up and down the lake, and everything in between. The edges of the lake get very green with slimy weeds (invasive eurasian milfoil.) If you're near Christie's Landing, expect loud music on the weekends, plus lots of boats coming in and out.  If you're staying on the south shore, especially the south west shore, that would be the quietest section of the lake. Farthest away from the boat launches, railroad tracks, and traffic going through the Yahara.  Waubesa is a fantastic fishing lake, like the rest of the Yahara chain."

Madison's most iconic lake, with the terrace, a fantastic view of downtown, beautiful sunsets with light coming through the capital, and absolutely ZERO places to park your boat and get food.  I don't get it.  If there was even ONE restaurant on Lake Monona it would make an absolute KILLING."

madisonwi,384uuz,vatoniolo,5,Mon Jun 1 21:34:59 2015 UTC,The details are light on the web site. Can someone ELI5? What happens here? Are there things besides food? How much should I expect to spend considering food tickets cost above the admission price?
madisonwi,384uuz,bobbaddeley,2,Tue Jun 2 13:03:33 2015 UTC,it's pretty much like taste of madison but with really high end vendors. the madison area chefs network includes all chefs from all the top restaurants in the area and they each have a booth with a smaller dish or beverage for $5. It's worth it for the quality of food you're getting and supports local restaurants. I went last year and it was awesome they have beers and live music as well.
madisonwi,384uuz,ericj4,2,Tue Jun 2 13:54:34 2015 UTC,"I would plan on buying at least 6 food/beverage tickets for $30. So for $40 total you would get a combination of 6 small plates and beverages. The beverages include craft beer and cocktails, and the food is simply amazing. It's defeinitely not a cheap event, but I paid almost $100 per dinner during MACN week in March and kept coming back for more. EDIT: There is a music stage and there are carnival style booths with stuff to keep kids busy, but I think most people come for the food"
madisonwi,384uuz,tasunder,2,Tue Jun 2 16:36:22 2015 UTC,The food was outstanding.  It really is what Taste of Madison should be... regional or local restaurants serving something delicious and off the menu.  I hope they restructure the beverages.  It doesn't make sense to me that the craft cocktails cost the same as the beer.  Those beers were small and most of them were normally $3-4 for a full pint normally.  Seems like beer should be 1/2 ticket or something.
madisonwi,384uuz,endau,2,Tue Jun 2 19:36:10 2015 UTC,"So excited. I think the only better food event is REAP's Burgers and Brews, and that just happened, so on to the next!"

madisonwi,383544,Dizzy_Slip,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:36:30 2015 UTC,"Golf might be fine locally.  But I doubt that trouble booking tee times is an overall national indicator of golf's popularity.  Plus that's also not a good indicator of overall local numbers. Some locals still like to play golf, sure of course.  And most of those people work during the week and play golf on the weekends.  So of course it's harder to book a tee time on weekends. How A Declining Middle Class Is Killing Golf Golfhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/bobcook/2014/05/23/how-a-declining-middle-class-is-killing-golf/  Golf is on the decline in the US because...  http://www.cnbc.com/id/101860445  U.S. golf courses in steady decline http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/12461331/number-us-golf-courses-steady-decline-says-report  There are tons of other articles online if you do some research.  EDIT: Part of the reason golf is doing okay locally is economics.  Lots of money in Madison.  But that might change as GOP and Walker policies go into full swing! Get it? ""Swing?""  FORE!"
madisonwi,383544,Dizzy_Slip,3,Tue Jun 2 01:47:34 2015 UTC,"Did you read any of the articles that you cited? One is about the decline in ""New courses"" not golfers.   Another includes this quote disputing the authors claim:  ""In fact, the continuing bad press about golf's decline is not accurate, Bishop said, adding that ""golf is not in a hole or in a rut.""  I will agree that golfs popularity has been in decline since the time tiger was playing peak golf but it's a pretty big stretch to say that golf is a dying sport."
madisonwi,383544,Dizzy_Slip,3,Tue Jun 2 03:31:29 2015 UTC,"The article was also about the closing of existing golf courses. And hey, They don't close courses or slow down building new ones if they're making money, i.e. if there are plenty of golfers for all those courses...  It's basic logic.  And you're really selectively reading those articles.  The Bishop guy represents the golf industry. So he's of course PAID to make things not look so bad.  We can quibble about what it means to be a ""dying sport.""  Of course, there will always be golfers around. Things change.  There are also people who still use typewriters.  Nothing ever completely ""dies"" in the absolute sense you want to argue for.  But golf is a dying sport."
madisonwi,383544,smiles134,0,Tue Jun 2 04:55:28 2015 UTC,"Golf may be in a lull, that is true. But the  term ""dying sport"" means it will soon be a ""dead"" sport.  Like Jai Alai .  Wish as much as you like that will never happen. Like every other sport, stock market, real estate etc... There are peaks and valleys.

madisonwi,383544,come-atme-bro,3,Mon Jun 1 22:38:28 2015 UTC,"Actually not ""so false.""  Bryant Gumbel just did a show on golf-- his sports show for ESPN. Golf's numbers nationally are dwindling.  Millennials are not playing golf.  If you have HBO,  you can search for it and watch it. I think it was from either late last year or early this year.  Golf courses are trying new things to bring in more golfers like enlarging the hole.  But it isn't just a generational difference.  Economics is also playing a big role in golf's declining numbers.  Here's just one article from last year on Forbes:   How A Declining Middle Class Is Killing Golf Golfhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/bobcook/2014/05/23/how-a-declining-middle-class-is-killing-golf/  Golf is on the decline in the US because... http://www.cnbc.com/id/101860445  U.S. golf courses in steady decline http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/12461331/number-us-golf-courses-steady-decline-says-report  I mean we can disagree about the overall reasons. But Millennials are not playing golf.  Golf is a dying sport."
madisonwi,383544,Dizzy_Slip,2,Tue Jun 2 01:44:44 2015 UTC,"I stand corrected!  I play and have a lot of friends who play, so I must be in the minority.  I know a big reason I don't play more is the cost barrier.  Way too expensive to play as much as I want and where I'd like to."

madisonwi,37tbzk,DoktorLoken,9,Sat May 30 16:56:44 2015 UTC,"I'd just walk around the Capitol Square, down State St. and then hang out at the Union Terrace. Go get a nice meal somewhere in that area as there are a zillion nice restaurants. If it's a Saturday morning there is a fantastic farmer's market on the square too.  If you get bored or have time after that, Willy St. is a great neighborhood and representative of the more hippie or alternative side of life Madison is well known for. Again, lots of great restaurants and bars and also very walkable.  Stick to the isthmus/campus/willy st. areas as the far East and West sides don't have much worth seeing; they're much more suburban and/or commercial areas."

madisonwi,37tbzk,WorkplaceWatcher,8,Sat May 30 17:02:54 2015 UTC,"Checking out the shops on State St is one of the biggest things you can do. If it's a nice day you should check out Olbrich Gardens (it's free). Monona Terrace is one of the more iconic spots, and gives a pretty good view of one of the lakes. You could also tour the Capital (I think that's free too but I don't know if it's only available certain days). For dinner, you could do the Old Fashioned or any other place on the square around the capital, but I'd go to the Great Dane downtown location. Great beer brewed onsite, great atmosphere, and great food."

madisonwi,37tbzk,internet_sage,3,Sat May 30 13:22:30 2015 UTC,Thursday the 11th. Is parking normally pretty difficult downtown?
madisonwi,37tbzk,internet_sage,3,Sat May 30 17:01:19 2015 UTC,"You should be able to find parking in the ramps. Bare in mind that it's $1 per half-hour (max $12) during the day. Evenings it drops to a flat $5 for the ramps and free after (I believe) 7pm on the streets.  I typically head downtown at least once every two weeks. Notably decent places to go during the day on the Square or State Street: Cooper Tavern, Capital Haus Brewery, Irish Pub, and really any others that peak your interest. I would avoid Nick's - never had anything good from there.  If you're there in the evenings, The City is interesting (it's an underground bar), Natt Spil as I mentioned, and Monday's, which has extremely cheap tap specials."
madisonwi,37tbzk,sordfysh,1 point,Sat May 30 17:17:04 2015 UTC,"Sorry last question, is your hotel downtown?  Parking near the capitol square is going to cost you.  It's $0.75 every half hour up to $12 at the city ramps.  Asking about hotel trying to figure out best place to park since my recommendations will be beer focused."
madisonwi,37tbzk,thefootballhound,1 point,Sat May 30 17:34:45 2015 UTC,"Hotel is downtown, on the isthmus. Pretty walkable to State St, etc from what I can tell on Maps."
madisonwi,37tbzk,sordfysh,2,Sat Jun 6 02:30:30 2015 UTC,"Not much happening next Thursday.  There's a show at the Majestic.  Obviously tour the Capitol and see the shitstorm politics.  I'd start around the square and grab pre-dinner drinks at Genna's/Brocach/Tipsy Cow/Old Fashioned/Merchant.  For dinner, ($10-20 a person) Old Fashioned/Cooper's Tavern, ($20-$30 a person) Harvest/Heritage/Graze, ($30-$40 a person) L'etoile/Tornado Room.  Dessert at Fresco on top of the Art Museum for the best sunset views.  Then roll down State St college/dive bars and stumble back to your hotel room.  Please try not to go swimming."
madisonwi,37tbzk,apbadger,4,Sat Jun 6 02:58:05 2015 UTC,"What do you like? Madison has a ton of cool things to see, good places to eat, and fun things to do. As others have said, when will you be here? Be exact - if there's something awesome going on that day, we can point you to it.   Generically:    Top and bottom of State Street - top is Capital square, which is pretty and surrounded by great places to eat and drink, museums, etc. State which has a hundred+ shops and restaurants. Bottom of State Street leads to Memorial Union Terrace, which is a fantastic place to grab something to eat and drink and sit and watch the boats on the lake.  Museums - we have a whole bunch, and a lot are free. War, art, kids, geology, history, mustard, etc.  Music - we have tons of live music of pretty much all genres. Let us know what you like and when you'll be here, and maybe we can come up with a show.  Nature stuff - Olbrich botanical gardens, Vilas Zoo, UW Arboretum, etc. Most free.  Food - we have a pretty astounding amount of restaurants, from greasy spoons, ethnically diverse places from around the world, upscale pubs, locally sourced ingredients, and pretty high-class stuff. Not uncommon to see some of the Capital square restaurant chefs out buying from the farmer's market and designing their menus as they go along.  Beer. We have beer. And breweries."
madisonwi,37tbzk,thefootballhound,1 point,Sat May 30 14:40:15 2015 UTC,"I'll be there on Thursday, June 11 so if you know of anything going on that day, please share. Would love to check out a brewery too! Thanks for the good list!"
madisonwi,37tbzk,apbadger,2,Sat May 30 17:00:28 2015 UTC,"Are you interested in touring or just drinking? And what kind of beer are you into? For tours, your best bets are the bigger breweries - Capital, Ale Asylum, Wisconsin Brewing company. If you're just drinking, go brewery hopping. There are a good half dozen to hit. If you like hoppy beers, Ale Asylum is a good bet. If you like more traditional English style beers, Karben 4 is doing some excellent work. For more experimental, Vintage Brewing on Whitney (Vintage bar downtown is related but only carries their stock stuff) and One Barrel both take some risks. They don't always pan out, but they are interesting!   Big German-style breweries are Capital and Wisconsin Brewing Company, with WBC founded by some of the former members and brewers of Capital. To me at least, that makes them a bit too similar. Lots of smooth, dark, malty beers from both.   Scattered around Madison you'll find the Great Dane pub and brewing - great food at decent prices, and a fair amount of good beer. Each location has a brewer, and while they share a core set of beers, the seasonal/special beers at each location differ. I lean towards the Hilldale branch, but that's in part due to me working on the west side of town.     Beers aside, if you want an authentic Madison trip, you just need to pick something random and do it. We have loads and loads of random stuff to do - that's the authentic Madison experience.   http://www.isthmus.com/search/event/What-To-Do/#search_date=2015-06-11  Pick your date and scroll and scroll and scroll. You'll find tons of stuff to do. Pick a handful and go! Piano bar, open mic, Jazz, Irish, Indie-folk-rock, etc.   Go to a Madison Mallard's game and sit in the Duck Blind and drink Great Dane beer - that's pretty damn authentic Madison. Broom St. Theater, Bar Trivia, Art Exhibit, etc. are all just random great things to do.   If you are having trouble deciding, let us know!"
madisonwi,37tbzk,sordfysh,3,Sat May 30 17:45:23 2015 UTC,What day of the week? Will you be in town for brunch? What's your budget?
madisonwi,37tbzk,frenchfryinmyanus,1 point,Sat May 30 13:43:06 2015 UTC,On a Thursday (rolling into town Wednesday night). So brunch is a yes!
madisonwi,37tbzk,Badgerisbest,1 point,Sat May 30 17:01:00 2015 UTC,Best brunch is Marigolds.  Always a line out the door on weekends.  You can find seating on weekdays.
madisonwi,37tbzk,djcube,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:00:13 2015 UTC,"For Dinner, Old Fashioned or the Great Dane and get cheese curds, for gods sake.  If you are 21-25, check out state street bars. Do a snorkel at Chasers to start, then a boot at Brats. Go from there. 26+: stay around the capitol or go to Willy St. The Merchant has the best coctails in the city  and the Dane, Coopers, and Old Fashioned have great beers. Maybe do a boot at Essen Haus.  In the morning, either do brunch at Old Fashioned or Graze. Delux and Marigolds are great too. Get yourself a bloody mary. Best bloodies are at Capitol Tap house, IMO. If you want something quick, get Gotham Bagels.  Then, make your way to the terrace for a pitcher by the lake if the weather is nice. Get yourself a spotted cow beer if you haven't yet.  Also, park your car on Wednesday night and walk everywhere you go until you leave. Check out the stuff on State and anything that catches your eye."
madisonwi,37tbzk,Badgerisbest,2,Sat May 30 17:42:35 2015 UTC,I will add to this if you want GOOD cheese curds get them from some place other than Old Fashioned.  Way too greasy...

I got an amazing 6 year old kitty from the humane society, and when I was looking at the cats there were so many adults that had been there a really long time, since everyone wants kittens. Adult cats make great pets too!"

madisonwi,37t8ex,The_Techie_Chef,8,Sat May 30 05:04:02 2015 UTC,"Hilldale is pretty sweet. Great Dane, Pasquals and Cafe Porta Alba are all great. If you have $100 burning a hole in your pocket I would imagine Flemings is pretty nice but I would probably go to Smokeys instead. Sentry (Metcalfe's if you are new here) is one of the best grocery stores in town and the prices are reasonable given the quality.   There is a bike trail just north of University that heads toward downtown.   Shorewood Hills puts on a decent fireworks show for the 4th.   Each summer there is a Opera in the Park at Garner park. Its not far from Hilldale. Garner Park has probably the coolest park shelter I have ever seen.   The Sequoya library on Midvale at Tokay is very nice."
madisonwi,37t8ex,n609mike,6,Sat May 30 16:31:58 2015 UTC,"And if you do not think the prices at Sentry are reasonable, just go across the street to Copps."
madisonwi,37t8ex,new-money,2,Sat May 30 19:27:59 2015 UTC,"You're also a pretty short bike ride (through Shorewood Hills) from the Frautschi Point nature preserve, my favorite place in Madison. Newcomers don't seem to know about it, but it's amazing--a large area of woods, fields, and shoreline in the middle of the city.   Oh, and for the one-two punch, you're also close to Hoyt Park and Quarry Park, little pockets of nature that were never developed. The former has a great view of Madison from the top of the hill (there's a road) and a reputation as a haven for West High stoners (as a former West High stoner, I can confirm this). The latter has fewer amenities, but amazing mountain bike trails."

Also some new shops coming (Lucky I believe is opening tomorrow or at least some time this week)."
madisonwi,37t8ex,Detfinato,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:24:04 2015 UTC,Nice! I was in the area today for an interview and checked out the mall a little bit. Looks like a Sur la Table is opening up this week... I don't think it's a good thing for me to live close to that store :)
madisonwi,37t8ex,RunsWithShibas,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:55:19 2015 UTC,I walked around there after returning a movie at the Redbox in Metcalfe's and it looked like Lucky and maybe Kate Spade were already open.  Sur La Table looked close and the sign said opening Wednesday June 3.  All of the shoe stores seemed ready - I think Morgan's has been open.  Cafe Hollander is going to be a while (building not complete).

madisonwi,37l95t,_stonecoldsaidso,4,Thu May 28 16:34:21 2015 UTC,Maybe one day would have been better. 60-90 days seems more legit. Maybe some community service fixing up bikes for kids or something.

madisonwi,37l95t,n609mike,0,Thu May 28 17:07:42 2015 UTC,"I think a proper ass-kicking would suffice.   When I was 13 some girl stole my bike when I went inside McDonalds for literally 2-3 minutes.  I found her later that day, she claimed it was her bike that her dad bought her (it obviously wasn't).    She wouldn't stop riding it some my friend rammed her with his bike.  Then she wouldn't let go of it, so I punched her in the uterus.  This was the only time I harmed a girl, physically.  It was awesome.  I bet she didn't steal a bike again."
madisonwi,37l95t,ScottWalkerSucks,6,Fri May 29 16:07:10 2015 UTC,"SOME prison would be reasonable. Madison likes to think that it's a bicycling mecca, but think about the discrepancy: Steal a $500 car, and it's an automatic felony. Steal a $2000 bike (or $2000 worth of bikes) and it's community service and deferred prosecution.   That said, I'm not sure what to think about the guys from the original article. They very possibly could have been guilty, but on the other hand, I have a friend who was arrested for selling a stolen bike on Craigslist, and he was straight-up innocent--he bought it at a yard sale, in a nice neighborhood, from someone who apparently had a budding heroin problem and had stolen it on campus a week before."
madisonwi,37l95t,Visceralrealism,5,Thu May 28 23:10:36 2015 UTC,"I am completely supportive of deferred sentencing and probation over jail time. Especially deferred sentencing, because it's only available to first-time offenders and helps keep people from getting sucked into the never-ending cycle of the justice system. And I say that as someone who has been a victim of theft. There is room for second chances in nearly every situation.  I also don't think locking people in cages is an appropriate form of punishment in most cases, and especially for a crime like this. We often forget what the goal of our justice system is. I'm of the opinion that it should not be about revenge or retribution, but about rehabilitation. And the simple fact is that rehabilitation does not happen in a cage.  That said, I do agree that the disparity is bullshit. Why cars have such special rules about theft versus other personal property doesn't make any sense to me. It should be based on dollar value of the item stolen, regardless of what that item is.  Also, don't confuse jail and prison. They're two very different things, and I think we're all talking about jail but we're using the word prison."
madisonwi,37l95t,_stonecoldsaidso,4,Thu May 28 23:26:00 2015 UTC,"Disclosure: I used to work in a bike shop. We had tons of shady people trying to sell us stolen bikes, and when it was super obvious, we would call the police.  They don't care, and the thieves know this very well.  And yes, I know that jail and prison are different, and I think that serial bike thieves deserve the latter. I'm not sure how you rehabilitate someone shitty enough to steal bikes."
madisonwi,37l95t,Visceralrealism,4,Fri May 29 00:10:36 2015 UTC,"I feel like police disregard for bike theft is just a symptom of the larger issue of police (and most government institutions) simply not giving a shit about bicyclists. The same police that ignore your bike theft reports are the same ones that did nothing when I was hit by a car while riding. It's not that they don't care about bicycle theft, it's that they don't care about bicycle anything."
madisonwi,37l95t,_stonecoldsaidso,3,Fri May 29 00:18:20 2015 UTC,"Yep.  Take note, politicians of Madison: I will vote for you if you take bike issues seriously."
madisonwi,37l95t,Visceralrealism,5,Fri May 29 00:27:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how you rehabilitate someone shitty enough to steal bikes.   Honestly, dude, do you have any sense of the relatively minor nature of stealing a bike?  We can rehabilitate murderers, rapists, and heroin addicts, but you don't think it's possible to rehabilitate bike thieves?  You clearly don't have any idea what you're talking about."
madisonwi,37l95t,it2d,4,Fri May 29 01:50:37 2015 UTC,"SOME prison would be reasonable.   No offense, but this comment shows that you don't know what you're talking about.  Prison is where we put the absolute worst offenders--murderers, rapists, child molesters, repeated drunk drivers, that sort of thing.  Prison is the last option in a graduated system of responses.  If someone's got a record a mile long that includes previous stints in prison and a huge list of property crimes and they're on supervision when they steal a bike, then maybe--MAYBE--I see the argument for prison.  Maybe.  But if someone's a moron kid or a drug addict or something and he steals one bike, then it is asinine to suggest that he deserves prison.   Steal a $500 car, and it's an automatic felony.   You might be charged with a felony, but that doesn't mean you'll get convicted of a felony.  There's a misdemeanor car-theft crime that's basically meant to cover a joyriding situation, but felony car-theft charges are often amended to misdemeanors, again depending at least in part on the record of the guy who stole the car.  Also, it's not really a fair analogy between a car and a bike.  A car isn't just a mode of transportation, like a bike; it's a sealed container of private space.  A bike literally is just a mode of transportation.  I've had both a bike and a car stolen, and I can tell you that the car hurt much more than the bike.   Steal a $2000 bike (or $2000 worth of bikes) and it's community service and deferred prosecution.   Again, this is a very likely outcome for someone who has no offenses before stealing the bike or the car."
madisonwi,37l95t,it2d,3,Fri May 29 01:49:05 2015 UTC,"Why does an 'enclosed space' matter.   And I agree, it's both unlikely and unfair for a first offense bike theft charge to result in prison--I'm talking about repeat offenders, who never get to that point because the earlier offenses aren't taken seriously.   And I freely admit that I'm a bike nut and possibly a tad emotional on the subject."

madisonwi,37kvi9,acarrick,12,Thu May 28 16:59:50 2015 UTC,"Many years back now, Madison East had such a poorly trained academic decathlon team that when they were invited as a walk-on at Worlds a kid actually died in competition with a vastly superior Japanese National Team. Everybody expected the school to do the right thing and just cut the team, but the following year Madison East flew in the same Russian coach that had led the turn-around of the former (and now famed) Soviet Academic Olympiad Squad (the Calculating Comrades) in the 80s. His hard-charging and uncompromising style didn't jive well with the Madison kids and stories started getting back to the parents. This was in the pre-computer era so everything had to be written by hand, and during practice for the essay portion one kid supposedly landed in the hospital with writer's cramps spanning from his index finger to his genitals. Another kid lost-consciousness after the coach demanded that all debates include a physical challenge. It was a dark time and basically all of the kids wanted to quit. But then they won their first event against what was supposed to be an incredibly powerful Oregon team...and then decimated Sun Prairie, where a kid had to be carted off in a stretcher following the geography section. The team began to see the method to this man's madness and came to love him like a father. Unfortunately, the parents didn't understand and wanted his head, and the school eventually had no choice but to boot him off the team right before the Madison East boys were to take on the reigning global champs...you guessed it, the same Japanese National team that had slayed one of their students the year before. Amazingly, the coach skipped his flight, barged into the competition, and coached the hell out of those kids, and the rest is history. I think it was in the Cap Times."

Turns out the players who would have been cut just sat on the sidelines and only got a few plays per game. But honestly that's probably how it should be. You want your team to win and at some point kids need to learn that there are winners and losers in life. If you want to get more playing time, work harder at practice or explore other opportunities where you might be more naturally talented.  In general, I had no problem with our high school sports. Football practice was tough, but that's how it should be. However, I also played tennis and our practices were laughably easy.

See MUFN's map (PDF link) (although I don't know how up-to-date that is).  Edit: if you are interested in doing this, I'd suggest finding if you have a local neighborhood association and seeing if there's a way to push it through from that end.

But this ruling is really funny because it's apparent that the judge didn't understand the type of poker machines they had and thought these were the same video poker machines they have at bars everywhere. Ho-chunk's machines simply automated the dealer present at any other casino, and that type of poker (along with any dealer game like blackjack) is still not allowed at Ho-Chunk.  Clearly technology has changed since the original compact with Ho-Chunk to open the Madison casino, and mangled rulings like this one don't help matters."

United States of America of article  Entrapment:       Entrapment defenses in the United States has evolved mainly through case law. Two competing tests exist for determining whether entrapment has taken place, known as the ""subjective"" and ""objective"" tests. The ""subjective"" test looks at the defendant's state of mind; entrapment can be claimed if the defendant had no ""predisposition"" to commit the crime. The ""objective"" test looks instead at the government's conduct; entrapment occurs when the actions of government officers would usually have caused a normally law-abiding person to commit a crime.

I left my car at Dutch Mill when being picked up by friends for road trips a few times and never had an incident. One time was a day or two over the limit so I called and they basically said its not going to be a problem.
madisonwi,37i0h0,n609mike,2,Wed May 27 20:37:13 2015 UTC,"I doubt they'd tow you that quickly. My guess is worst case scenario you'd get a ticket. A couple weeks ago there was a car parked in the same spot that I walk by to/from work that stayed there for about a week and a half. Didn't move (it was kind of sticking out of the front of the space and had out of state plates, so I noticed it more and stayed that same amount sticking out the entire time) and it took a week before a ticket was there one day. It was 2 days after the ticket when the car was gone, I'm assuming towed. This was downtown near the intersection of W. Wash and Regent for reference."

I would leave my car any day in my permitted area for four days over Dutch Mill. Unless there is something you haven't said about your street but then just park on a different block of the permitted area. Or have a friend move your car if you're really worried (thou, really, where are you coming from, I've never once considered this). Your parking enforcement probably knows your car anyway if you've been parking with a permit for a while now. Leave your car on the street, and have a good trip."

As one author wrote, Native American history as taught starts at Plymouth Rock and ends at Wounded Knee. This misses the entire modern history of many tribes.   Tribes are now interested in showing cultural history and current affairs, whether it's discussing the Red Power movement in the 60s and 70s, the Indian Child Welfare Act that literally prevented abducting children from families before 1978, to current movements of sustainable fisheries, marijuana legalization measures being discussed, or tribal harvest celebration. There are so many interesting changes in tribes based on what's occurring in different places.   There are some damn interesting things going on right now."
madisonwi,37e2qu,Abzug,1 point,Wed May 27 02:06:04 2015 UTC,"Since moving here from Pennsylvania I have been curious about the tribes here in Wisconsin. Back home there was a very small reservation across the border in New York but I never went there. It was flooded by a dam built down river, with just a tiny strip of land hugging the banks. My perception has been that the folks on reservations most likely would like to be left alone. Sort of like some of the areas of Maui where the locals really get pissed when a ""Haole"" wanders into their valley. Out of respect I've not tried to interact without invite but now see there's a movement to interact and teach. I would like to learn more about this. This article says this state has the largest population east of the Mississippi yet I have only seen perhaps a few dozen folks that I thought were native."
madisonwi,37e2qu,Darter02,3,Wed May 27 12:09:07 2015 UTC,"Many reservations have a cultural center set up.   You can always check into that as it is the center for outreach.   I haven't seen many, but the centers I've visited are nice enough, but nowhere to the level of a museum quality.   I mention that in order to temper expectations, but they are really neat as you can ask questions of any volunteer and they can give you accounts of it through personal experience or how a certain issue has had repercussions (good or bad) through the community.   You can also call the information desk and ask if there are any public events going on to visit. As with any cultural experience, go in and set aside your expectations, as the experience should lead you to a better understanding of today's culture and the culture of yesteryear. It's great fun! You can also watch for websites of the tribes to announce public events."

I grew up with saying 'Indian' for those native to the Americas. I grew up with sitting 'Indian Style.' I also grew up with 'Nigger Piles' & 'Smear the Queer.' All three are considered not polite to say and I agree.  So, are we just in a transition time, or can I start using subtle slurs for other people in here? It's not that much harder to write, 'Native American.' And it's more geographically accurate and not ambiguous.

madisonwi,37e2qu,new-money,0,Wed May 27 16:29:50 2015 UTC,"I disagree that it is not a slur. Got your source proving me wrong or is it just your opinion?   Your analogy doesn't make sense.

madisonwi,37chdx,madtownWI,8,Tue May 26 16:48:53 2015 UTC,I love how our School Boards are focused on banning logos of Native American teams and not the actual education of the students.

They should ban the depictions and the use of these Indian logos. You don't need a poll of the students or a study commissioned to understand there should be a ban. Listening to Mary Burke on this almost makes me wish I had voted for Darth Walker instead of her. They should have passed a ban in ten seconds, said we can all agree using these logos is stupid and we are sorry we did in the past. End of story. These people can fuck up a cup of coffee and it is them that we trust the education of our kids."

I think it's stupid to ban kids from showing their team fandom.  I would love to see them propose this sort of ban anywhere near Cleveland, Washington DC, Chicago, Kansas City, or Atlanta. It would be a shitshow. Hell, if the Braves were still in Milwaukee there's no way this would fly."

For a given depiction, ask if it reinforces racial stereotypes about an oppressed group.  That's why ""but but but, the Celtics and Vikings!"" isn't much of a response. Irish people aren't an oppressed group today, and Scandinavians hardly ever were. Redskins, though? Cut that shit out."

One of the largest and oldest sports franchises in the world and they've had to fight the same battle over and over for years and years. And they will continue to do so. Nothing is going to change anytime soon.  Although I disagree with banning team attire, I think this is an important point:   “We in the Madison Metropolitan School District need to represent the 11 tribes within Wisconsin and their wishes, and those tribes do not wish to be represented in way that they deem offensive,” Saiz said to cheers from the audience. “It is does not matter what people in Florida think or people in Chicago think about what offends them. It matters what people here think.”   I'm not much of a baseball or hockey fan so I can't speak much to their similar issues, but I've followed the Redskins branding battle closely and one of the big arguments is that a lot of tribes like the team and recognize it as the tribute it's meant to be. But if the tribes around here all find it offensive, then so be it."
madisonwi,37chdx,bamako,7,Wed May 27 13:18:37 2015 UTC,"That is true, but there is also the issue of freedom of speech which specifically forbids the government from being able to (in most cases) do stuff like this. I wouldn't be surprised if this gets challenged at some point."

madisonwi,37chdx,wisconsinpointer,2,Wed May 27 16:18:37 2015 UTC,"I will let you google that on your own, because there are numerous articles detailing polls that show the majority of Native Americans do not find the team name offensive.  I will give you the gist of the argument: many Native Americans feel ignored. ""We are the invisible people."" They are far more concerned about education, drugs, and suicide issues the Native American population face. And while that doesn't mean smaller issues should be ignored, sports teams are the most outward facing symbolism of their people -- and that is something they need right now. The teams themselves honor Native Americans in many ways. The only issue is a very old brand, which has tremendous value. But that brand is the reason why Native Americans receive a lot of attention today, and hopefully that attention will go towards solving much more pressing issues."
madisonwi,37chdx,new-money,0,Wed May 27 17:48:46 2015 UTC,You never answered my question. Everything you cite is bunk. You then try to deflect from the argument at hand while dismissing the real issue. Sad.

I responded to your first assertion, then you changed it midway through the conversation because you had nothing to back up your position. That change midstream, like I said, was a deflection off the main argument. I didn't respond to argue over the plight of native Americans in general. I responded over your assertion that most or a lot of the tribes like the name & what the team stands for.  I asked you what it is that they stood for, and I called you out on your assertions that native Americans like the name, etc. If that's not contributing to the conversation, show your way out that door.

madisonwi,37chdx,KrillBeBallaz,4,Wed May 27 00:37:52 2015 UTC,"I think there is an issue in how tribes are muddled together into a broad group.   Consider that people wouldn't say Germans are exactly the same as Italians, but tribes are lumped together as a group as a whole, while tribes were vastly different.    Whether it's the Ojibwa tribes, the Dakota tribe, or the Seminole tribe, they are all called ""Indians/Native Americans"", but they were extremely different in language, trade, and day to day life. Still, they are lumped together in a cartoon like characters.   That's why the idea that these teams representing native tribes is somewhat silly.   They represent a generic idea of Native Americans, but succeed in representing none of the actual tribes, except for Chief Black Hawk and the Sauk tribe, which is really quite specific (and really refer to three different tribes, yet none of them played much hockey.   :)"
madisonwi,37chdx,madman86,3,Wed May 27 16:08:22 2015 UTC,Bingo!   It's tough knowing bits of history and seeing it whitewashed as a whole.   Thanks for the understanding!

I'm well aware of the racism my Irish great-grandfather would have encountered when he got off the boat, but trying to present the Irish today as an oppressed group is insulting to actual oppressed groups.  ""Redskins"" was not a team name chosen by any native peoples, and is a term taken from a more racist past."

They somewhat recently moved to their new location which shouldn't affect cost, but they always gave me very fair pricing.  (New car still under warranty at the dealership is the only reason I haven't been recently.)  Handels (from another commenter) is also good.  One I have had issues with is Chets.  I know they sometimes get recommended but I just personally never had a great experience with them, and in fact had some downright bad ones.

He wouldn't do it, he claimed that he only mounts/balances tires that HE sells, because it's 'dangerous' to mount tires that customers bring in.   He then proceeded to tell me that tires purchased online are often defects, and that mounting them could result in them blowing out at any second, leading to a massive accident.  I don't know what kind of drugs he is on, but I've never heard that before.  I got my tires mounted at tires plus and they've been fine for 20,000 miles now.

madisonwi,379vec,ScottWalkerSucks,3,Tue May 26 23:05:35 2015 UTC,Cool.  Meeting the dog and realizing it isn't threatening is half the battle of fighting preconceived notions about pits
madisonwi,379vec,toomuchmadison,3,Wed May 27 01:09:30 2015 UTC,"Landlords aren't just being jerks. The issue is property insurance. Home insurance companies charge more or outright refuse to provide coverage for rental properties that have certain breeds. I'm a landlord of one small place, and my insurance would cost loads more if I allowed a pit bull, Doberman, or Rottweiler on the property.  This is probably based more on stereotypes than statistics."
madisonwi,379vec,ScottWalkerSucks,2,Wed May 27 13:14:52 2015 UTC,That's why as far as you're concerned it's a mix.  Meet the dog and make your own judgement call.  Don't let society's stupid viewpoints on pits affect your decision

madisonwi,377wln,uncamad,2,Mon May 25 20:57:35 2015 UTC,"To further elaborate:  I have played guitar for 17 years, and have given lessons here and there. I have advised many people on their first guitar purchase, and have always given the advice I gave you. Buy used, spend $200 or less.   Used because you can get quality gear for cheap, have someone who knows what they're doing look at it before you buy. Stay nearer to $200 than further. The reason for this is because $200 is a sweet spot. It's just enough money to force you to play and practice. Otherwise it's a waste of $200. It's also just little enough that if you find that guitar isn't your thing, you only spent $200. And you'll probably be able to sell it and recoup most of your money.   Anyway, good luck!

I wouldn't buy it without having a knowledgable person look at it though. A guitar can look just fine to someone who doesn't know much, but to someone who is familiar could be not worth the money.   I would also look into an acoustic/electric model guitar because maybe someday you'll want to play live and plug into the sound system. By that point you may want a newer, better guitar, but might not be able to afford one. So why not buy one that has the capability now? I know performing seems like a daunting thing, but if you really click with it, you may find yourself wanting to play live very quickly."

The clerk was even willing to pop it into one of those new retro machines where you can play either NES or SNES games to prove that it worked clean. I don't think you will find amazing deals all of the time at Pre-Played. Just shop smart for stuff. I'm always looking at used game costs on both eBay and Amazon while shopping in store. But there is something to be said that buying that local and knowing it works may off set any saving you might get with an eBay auction.

madisonwi,36xvxz,caonabo,10,Sat May 23 00:59:21 2015 UTC,"I'm a legitimate fan of Ting, which works on Sprint towers. The best thing about Ting is you pay for what you get -- your bill adjusts each month depending on usage. I pay about half of what I use to pay on AT&T, about $55 a month for two smartphones (sometimes less). We bought new devices for Ting, but if saving money is your thing, you can buy a used phone on craigslist and throw in Ting's sim card.  I did a review of Ting a while back. Since this review, my coverage has gotten significantly better, and I rarely get any dropped calls. I just called from an elevator tonight and it was crystal clear. I'm not a huge data person, but I know I get LTE throughout downtown and major roads leaving Madison.  You can get $25 off your first bill with someone's referral link. Here's mine: https://zbemf62l9g5.ting.com/. Or help out another redditor at /r/Ting.   Edit/update: Until EOD June 8th, that referral link actually nets you $100 of credit, not just $25. Special summer promotion. Yay Ting!"
madisonwi,36xvxz,theoryface,2,Sat May 23 04:29:48 2015 UTC,Seconded. Buy your own phone (or use your existing one) and choose Ting.
madisonwi,36xvxz,PublickStews,3,Sun May 24 17:35:56 2015 UTC,"Anything CDMA will likely have the same service issues that you may be experiencing now.  Moving from Verizon to Sprint a year ago, my service didn't really change at all.  The big difference is that I'm paying $120 for two iPhone 5's with unlimited data.  Now, that unlimited comes with an unadvertised caveat - only 300mb per month of ""extended"" data. This isn't a problem along major roads, cities, or towns throughout the US, but it is a huge problem in extreme rural Wisco, where you're on Verizon's towers.  I ended up running out of data in 2 days on my vacation.  I called Sprint and they reactivated asking why I didn't just jump on Wifi... ugh.  Still, I can't say enough good things.  Cheap and fast, unlimited data that works nearly everywhere in Madison along with top-tier phones.  When I had issues with dropped calls at home they gave me an Airave for free, which made my cell practically a land line.  Crisp calls all the time."

I was on T-mobile about a year ago, but the coverage isn't very good in rural areas and I travel around too much.  So, I switched to StraightTalk (using AT&T's network) for around a year.  They were fine, but just recently I switched to Cricket which also uses AT&T's network and is just slightly cheaper for basically the same service. As far as the service goes, StraightTalk and Cricket seem comparable, but currently Cricket is cheaper.  Prices do change, so it may be different in the future.  A Verizon phone won't work on any of these GSM based cell phone providers (T-mobile, AT&T, Cricket, etc.), so you will need to buy a different phone.  I don't recommend buying phones from Cricket or StraightTalk.  Instead I recommend doing some research and buying an unlocked phone direct from a phone manufacturer."

Very rare for me not to have service at all. When you get around rural Wisconsin, things can definitely suck as far as speed goes though.   If you don't travel much, give US cellular a bash. Their service is great in most of the state, but they roam pretty much everywhere outside of Wisconsin and you're limited to 200MB of roaming 4g a month. After that you're stuck with 3g, which can be a real pain while traveling.  Oh, and they have a few promotional plans depending on where you sign up. PM me if you want more information on that."

The Union docks are convenient, so is the beach at Picnic Point. Or make friends with someone who lives in one of the housing co-ops on Mendota (Loth, Ambrosia, or Nottingham) for something more secluded. The beach at Bernie's on Monona is cool too, especially the diving raft."
madisonwi,36x068,Visceralrealism,1 point,Sat May 23 02:13:28 2015 UTC,"I'd have to disagree, spent most of my childhood swimming in lakes in the northwoods and have swam in more rivers and lakes whilst kayaking than I can remember.   Never had any issues until I moved to Madison and my first month swimming in Monona got two ear infections.  Coincidence?  I think not.  If you grew up swimming in lakes and rivers you would know by looking at Monona/Mendota just how nasty they are."
madisonwi,36x068,schnottus,2,Wed May 27 03:30:10 2015 UTC,Shhh. Those are our favorite two spots.

madisonwi,36x068,loblollyboy,3,Sat May 23 17:17:20 2015 UTC,The 'Verona Quarry' is Fireman's Park. It's great. http://www.ci.verona.wi.us/320/Firemans-Park-Beach
madisonwi,36x068,Peanutthegremlin,5,Sat May 23 22:14:39 2015 UTC,"I recommend the small beach near the Vilas neighborhood zoo, on Lake Wingra. They have a decent area of sand laid down in the water, and ropes and buoys to let you know where the boundaries are. My friends and I go there, stand out in the waist deep water, and throw a Frisbee around from time to time"
madisonwi,36x068,LittleFordee,3,Mon May 25 12:31:55 2015 UTC,Bernie's beach often gets a filtration system installed. It was a lot cleaner than anywhere else last time I used it.   The shore is typically the dirtiest spot while the middle of the lakes are the cleanest if you can get a hold of a small boat.   Check here before heading somewhere. https://www.publichealthmdc.com/environmental/water/beaches/  I also heard about some old gravel pit near Verona.   The Middleton pool is cheaper and nicer than Madison's.
madisonwi,36x068,n609mike,3,Fri May 22 23:23:48 2015 UTC,"Absolutely love Bernie's beach. Great capitol views and clean water, but not deeper than 3-4 feet. My favorite is BB Clarke for the diving board"
madisonwi,36x068,vatoniolo,2,Fri May 22 21:21:27 2015 UTC,You can swim in the lakes. Just take a shower before going to bed and you will be fine.

There is a very active community here and because we have a good mix of enlightened and resistance (more res than Enl though) there are lots of opportunities to play and level.    One of the best things about ingress is how it gets you OUT and discovering new things about the city.    You will also meet new people (some cool, some jerks, like everything) and get some exercise.    Highly recommend.    If you decide to play and you decide to chose the enlightened, let me know and I would be happy to get you connected to the rest of the group."

madisonwi,36vzz1,fulgoray,1 point,Tue May 26 14:54:43 2015 UTC,Generally you need to meet a few people in person.  We like to know that you are a real person and not a resistance double agent.    The easiest way to do that is to come to a first Saturday event.  There will be tons of folks around and we can get you set up to power level pretty quick.    What part of town are you in?

If you are down town, a few laps around the Sq. should get you to level 4-5.    Hack the blue portals and throw links.  When you get to level 5/6 you can get bursters that will start doing something.    Make sure to put resonators out everywhere you can.  Lots of AP for that as well."

madisonwi,36vzz1,ms_ashes,2,Fri May 22 17:07:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, there is a pretty established community of Ingress players in Madison with a fairly good mix of both teams.  I went to one meetup (they happen the 1st Saturday of the month generally), but didn't really hit it off with anyone, so I mostly just play solo on my commute.  I think there is also an Anomaly (big Ingress event) coming up in Milwaukee on June 20th.  I know the ENL players have a separate community chat that you can get into by filling out an application at join.madenl.com.  Not sure about the smurfs though."
madisonwi,36vzz1,Al_Ashrad,2,Fri May 22 20:52:16 2015 UTC,"I used to play it, but kids use their cars to make HUGE fields and kind of take the fun out of the game IMO."
madisonwi,36vzz1,layer555,2,Fri May 22 17:31:00 2015 UTC,Don't be hating on a BAF.   One of the lovely things about the game is there are so many different styles of play.  If you want to exclusively walk - cool.  If you want to drive - cool.  If you like to field - cool.  If you like to smash - cool.  If you like missions - cool.  If you just play for uniques - cool.    It's all love baby.  Just because someone does it differently does not make it bad.
madisonwi,36vzz1,legsintheair,2,Fri May 22 19:09:31 2015 UTC,"I mean, you're not wrong. But the problem is there's a handful of play styles that are exploited, which leaves the rest of us with no way to be competitive. They basically hijacked the fun for themselves and left most of us out to dry."
madisonwi,36vzz1,layer555,1 point,Fri May 22 20:07:57 2015 UTC,"You're not even wrong. Similarly, you can have a race on foot, bikes, or cars --and people actually do. If you put a runner, a cyclist, and a driver in the same race, it's not going to be a whole lot of fun for the runner and the cyclist.  Ingress seemed like a cool idea, but it gives too much of an advantage to drivers."

I'm level 8 (Highest level you need to be to use max level  items) and it got to the point where I either needed to join gangs of people driving around doing this or... don't.

madisonwi,36s0q9,Mswindupbird89,17,Thu May 21 17:58:41 2015 UTC,From what I have seen both get a small fine and potentially a large lawsuit. If either of them speed up or something malicious and it can be proven then it gets big real quick.
madisonwi,36s0q9,Mswindupbird89,3,Thu May 21 18:17:18 2015 UTC,Interesting.  I thought it would be something more severe. I'd be pretty pissed if I was the pedestrian and the driver didn't at least give a seriously huge fine.
madisonwi,36s0q9,devnul,5,Fri May 22 04:31:46 2015 UTC,I was hit by a car while riding a bike. I had one broken bone. Pretty much 100% the drivers fault. He gt a ticket similar to this. I ended up with over $20k from his insurance company plus whatever they paid to fix his car. I bet the driver checks for bikes now.
madisonwi,36s0q9,Mswindupbird89,4,Fri May 22 14:30:42 2015 UTC,Treated for bruises and road rash is not almost killing someone.
madisonwi,36s0q9,aiij,3,Thu May 21 21:32:53 2015 UTC,"Not in this case, no.  But running someone over with your car could potentially kill someone or seriously hurt them.  I'm not asking about this case, my question was about the incident in general or in other cases."
madisonwi,36s0q9,layer555,0,Fri May 22 04:29:50 2015 UTC,If you accidentally kill someone it's called manslaughter and I'm pretty sure the penalty is worse than for failure to yield.
madisonwi,36s0q9,thefootballhound,1 point,Mon May 25 19:16:00 2015 UTC,Yeah but potentially getting run over by a 2 ton death-ma-jig can be.

madisonwi,36s0q9,MadChris,8,Thu May 21 19:18:48 2015 UTC,We don't have a crosswalk problem in this town. I'm sure the 63 year old victim jumped in front of him.
madisonwi,36s0q9,on_my_lunch_break,11,Thu May 21 17:38:06 2015 UTC,"Do you mean cars stopping at the last moment before entering traffic rather than at the stop sign or white bar? Madison definitely has that problem. I assume other cities do as well, but I don't know.   The other problem I see is people treating right turns at red lights and stop signs like yield signs. This can create dangerous situations for all users of the road, not just pedestrians.   Also, most of Madison isn't a pedestrian town, and the corner of Sherman and Aberg certainly isn't. People just don't expect to see people walking."
madisonwi,36s0q9,MrTubes,6,Thu May 21 20:57:00 2015 UTC,I think a lot of the problem is that drivers aren't taught how to deal with pedestrians in uncontrolled intersections.
madisonwi,36s0q9,on_my_lunch_break,1 point,Thu May 21 21:34:18 2015 UTC,"Everyone on the road needs to be aware of and respect all other road users, regardless of their mode of transportation.

madisonwi,36s0q9,on_my_lunch_break,7,Fri May 22 01:07:37 2015 UTC,Sorry for assuming. I just see way too many people defending shitty driving on this subreddit and blaming pedestrians or ranting about bikers to deflect the issue.
madisonwi,36s0q9,aiij,0,Fri May 22 01:42:16 2015 UTC,"I'd just like an equal focus on both.  There's plenty of people on the other side of the issue that think that the responsibility should lie solely with vehicular traffic because ""they're deadly weapons"".  I simply cannot stand that attitude, and after having had my heart in my throat several times downtown when some moron walking or biking decided that ""Don't Walk"" is just a suggestion, or that stop signs don't apply to bikes because ""it's harder to get going again on a bike"", I literally stopped driving downtown.  I'm sure I'm not the only one.  Maybe some think it's reasonable that all drivers drive as if there's a pedestrian ready to dart in front of them at any given moment, or peg all the speed limits to 10 miles an hour in the city proper for ""safety"", but people have to get around.  Now I'll watch my comment get down voted to hell just like it always does whenever anyone complains about poor cycling and pedestrian behavior in this city.  Fucking Jaywalking tickets alone would net the city a goddamned fortune.  Licensing cyclists that want to operate on roadways would be a good step towards drilling safe biking behavior into people's minds, too.  I had to demonstrate proper driving ability before I was allowed to operate a vehicle on city street...so I don't see why cyclists shouldn't be held to the same standard."
madisonwi,36s0q9,on_my_lunch_break,3,Fri May 22 17:08:43 2015 UTC,"Everyone has a responsibility to drive/bike/walk as though other people might do something stupid and dangerous at any moment. Everyone. That is how you avoid killing/injuring someone, and it is how you avoid being killed or injured.  As a pedestrian who respects drivers and cyclists by following traffic rules to the letter, I would really like to get the same respect in return. That means: if I am attempting to cross at a marked crosswalk, don't make me wait ten minutes for a break in traffic. Stop and yield right-of-way, as you are legally obligated to do.  That being said, I do acknowledge that pedestrians and cyclists do not always follow the rules. But it's not as though drivers are saints, either. The respect needs to be mutual."

Stop and yield right-of-way, as you are legally obligated to do.   Are you actually in the crosswalk or about to enter the crosswalk when people don't yield? I've only just moved to Wisconsin, but in other states I've lived in you're required to yield to pedestrians in the crosswalk (not merely on the sidewalk near a crosswalk).  Also, you can often do much better than following the rules to the letter. Try to be reasonable instead of following the rules to the letter.  For example, following the rules to the letter (at least in PA) sometimes means you wait at an intersection while the only car in sight is waiting at a red light, then, as soon as the car gets a green light, you step out in front of them. That is following the rules to the letter. Please don't be that guy."

Anyone who thinks that proves proper driving ability isn't paying attention when they are out driving around recklessly.   Every hypocritical driver that speeds on EVERY trip and then has the audacity to whine like a little bitch about bikes not coming to a complete stop at every stop sign should be tied to their bumper and ran in to a fucking brick wall.   Jaywalking isn't even illegal here. Good thing you pass such a difficult test to get your license.   Please stay out of downtown and the city as whole. Why don't you move back you Arkansas.

I could see a couple:    Not entering a hostile residence without back up. The problem with this is if someone is being attacked and the lone officer can enter and stop the attack, but has to wait and the victim ends up injured or dead, then what? That fails the mission of protecting citizens.  Always have a partner in the car, but this effectively would double the police force in size. That is a huge expense and not one I'm sure most people would be willing to stomach (as taxes would have to go up significantly) because the city is relatively safe.    People want the community to have control over hiring and firing, but I don't think that is realistic and would be a very bad move."
madisonwi,36rapd,madman86,14,Thu May 21 18:59:18 2015 UTC,"No kidding.  You'd create the potential for a very corrupt system as well.  Also, did I miss something?  Until this shooting occurred, the Madison PD was used as a model police department on how to do community based policing and other 'progressive' policing techniques.  Have our policies changed?  In the course of this incident occurring did the PD somehow lose what they had before?   Or could it have been everything went correctly as it was supposed to, and we have a tendency to make mountains out of molehills when it comes to certain issues?"
madisonwi,36rapd,joerobo,3,Fri May 22 00:33:39 2015 UTC,"Always have a partner in the car, but this effectively would double the police force in size. That is a huge expense and not one I'm sure most people would be willing to stomach (as taxes would have to go up significantly) because the city is relatively safe.    It would double the number of cops if more were hired to put two people in each car. But why couldnt they just take half of the cops driving around, and put them with another cop? Instead of doubling the police force, cut the number of cars in half."
madisonwi,36rapd,nosaJ4297,9,Fri May 22 03:05:16 2015 UTC,"Then you're effectively halving your coverage and potentially doubling your response times. And, for most common police work, you're paying for a second warm body that adds no value.  Tough nut to crack, but I don't feel that fewer police vehicles is a viable solution."
madisonwi,36rapd,falarransted,4,Fri May 22 03:12:02 2015 UTC,They could but then response times would suffer which also isn't good. They could hire a smaller amount and reduce the number of cars and balance the reduction a bit.
madisonwi,36rapd,madman86,2,Fri May 22 12:22:14 2015 UTC,"Um. Hello? The community already has complete control over hiring and firing. Who the hell do you think sits on the Police and Fire Comission, Martians?"

madisonwi,36r1lg,MadtownMaven,7,Thu May 21 14:42:02 2015 UTC,"It's not really about the brats. They are indeed generic Johnsonville ones. No gourmet options there. The buying of the brats raises money for charities and that's why people tend to indulge in them. All the people working the brat sales lines and stuff are volunteers from a bunch of different organizations who get a percentage of the sales.   The festival itself has really grown and changed over the years. It used to be just cooking up brats in the parking lot of hilldale Metcalf's. Now it's a full on big event with headline music acts and all that other jazz. Personally, I preferred it when it was just selling brats for charity and none of the other hoopla, but that's just me."

madisonwi,36mpoh,lobstercombine,1 point,Thu May 21 02:27:31 2015 UTC,"No, it isn't."
madisonwi,36mpoh,HammerTimeHTFU,1 point,Fri May 22 14:14:52 2015 UTC,"Well that's a pretty solid argument, but consider this for a moment.  Cars use roads, cars have to be registered, registration money helps pay for the things cars use.  Bikes use roads/trails, bikes don't have to be registered. Where does the money for nice trails and signs and bike lanes come from? It may as well be at least partially from bikers. They're not even proposing an annual registration fee.   That said, I don't understand why they would want to collect taxes from bikers while also cutting bike services. That just seems like classic republican thievery."
madisonwi,36mpoh,lobstercombine,1 point,Fri May 22 17:26:54 2015 UTC,"Ah but we do have the daily and annual passes for a lot of popular trails in Wisconsin. It's pretty cheap so there's definitely more funding that goes into repair for those, but I like to think it makes a little dent. And it's good that it comes directly from the users."
madisonwi,36mpoh,shells195,3,Fri May 22 19:51:31 2015 UTC,"Increasing bike usage might actually decrease the overall cost of maintaining roads. The pdf linked to in this general summary article explains how road damage is related to the square of the weight of the vehicle travelling over the road.  It's easy to think of roads as these things that just deteriorate as they get older, but the truth is that the vehicles riding on the roads are causing tons of damage.  This is why some states are trying to push truck freight into trains. Similarly, this is why creating bike infrastructure and getting people out of cars might be cheaper in the long run.  Compared to cars, bikes are extremely light and cause very little damage. A $25 tax seems like overkill on bike sales."
madisonwi,36mpoh,ireallylikedogs,2,Thu May 21 14:20:07 2015 UTC,Bikes still require infrastructure; which costs money. where do you propose that money come from if not a bike tax
madisonwi,36mpoh,walletwarrior,2,Thu May 21 14:21:42 2015 UTC,"It's an investment, and the reward is less maintenance going into the future by reducing car load on roads.  There are plenty of other benefits. Having a nice bike infrastructure makes a city more desirable and increases home prices and property tax revenue. It increases traffic to commercial establishments near bike infrastructure, which increases their tax revenue. Encouraging bike commuters and public transportation reduces traffic during peak hours.  Not all civic decisions need to directly pay for themselves. We don't tax backpacks to pay for schools."
madisonwi,36mpoh,ireallylikedogs,1 point,Thu May 21 16:09:37 2015 UTC,Most cyclists also drive a care and pay the associated fees. Cyclists pay for roads via property taxes. Federal funding pays for a significant amount of transportation infrastructure. Wear and tear on infrastructure from a bicycle is virtually zero.
madisonwi,36mpoh,HammerTimeHTFU,1 point,Fri May 22 14:13:21 2015 UTC,Less than 1/4 of 1 percent of road money comes from the general fund. Most of the money comes from the gas tax and vehicle fees.
madisonwi,36mpoh,mcthreadski,0,Sat May 23 14:28:55 2015 UTC,"No they don't.  In post WW2 Europe, bicycles were the primary form of transportation in most bombed out cities because they can go almost anywhere, even when the whole town is rubble."
madisonwi,36mpoh,ScottWalkerSucks,3,Thu May 21 14:45:19 2015 UTC,"Come on, man. I work for WisDOT and you might be surprised how much money we invest into bike paths and other non-motorized transportation infrastructure. To say that it costs nothing doesn't really help the cause. I love to bike and I love the system that the state has when it comes to bike infrastructure and would love to see it expand, but it does cost money and it often times causes us to buy more right-of-way, which also costs money and can get property owners upset if they don't see the value in in the bike paths."
madisonwi,36mpoh,mcthreadski,1 point,Thu May 21 14:52:58 2015 UTC,"I am responding to OP, talking about bike usage decreasing the cost of maintaining roads.    Bikes dont' really require dedicated infrastructure, when they go on roads designed for cars they basically cause no damage whatsoever.  This state is a shithole.  Can't wait to leave, as it is getting worse every day."

madisonwi,36mpoh,ireallylikedogs,3,Fri May 22 01:46:09 2015 UTC,"Not if they decide to stop building roads that accommodate us though, right? Then our new bike tax just goes to straight to further helping car commuters only."
madisonwi,36mpoh,shells195,2,Thu May 21 13:32:23 2015 UTC,Except we still use the roads and there are more than just roads the taxes go to.
madisonwi,36mpoh,walletwarrior,1 point,Thu May 21 14:02:43 2015 UTC,"Right and I think the tax could actually do some real good as long as at least a portion of it went directly to bike paths, road safety, etc. In fact, I'd be happy to pay it knowing it could lead in part to a better riding experience. But I guess what I'm more getting at is that we do much less damage to roads than cars (so we save them at least a little money on road repair) so to me it doesn't make much sense to both take away the set aside funds for biking and walking safety and add taxes for those who still chose to do it."
madisonwi,36mpoh,shells195,2,Fri May 22 19:47:48 2015 UTC,"With that I also agree. Either reduce services and reduce taxes, or increase taxes to fund new/existing services.   Anything else is just a slap in the face."
madisonwi,36mpoh,lobstercombine,2,Fri May 22 17:35:45 2015 UTC,Since most of us also own cars and pay property taxes we already pay our fair share. More than our fair share once you consider the fact that a bicycle ride causes virtually zero wear and tear on infrastructure relative to using a car.
madisonwi,36mpoh,HammerTimeHTFU,0,Fri May 22 14:14:42 2015 UTC,"Especially since bikers rarely (if ever?) have to pay any usage tax, like drivers do, for use of the roads/bike lanes.

madisonwi,36th5q,justnachoday,11,Fri May 22 00:01:16 2015 UTC,"You'll want to live in the near-east or downtown area but not next to the UW students. Most of the decent social events in town happen in these places. If you are young and single and live in the suburbs you'll be spending all of your time driving to the downtown/near-east locations. Plus, like I've always said, the downtown and near-downtown areas still have a little bit of the Madison vibe left, the suburbs in Madison are just like the suburbs in any other city.  As far as the geography goes, look in the area east of Broom Street and west of the Yahara River for a primary search, and between the Yahara River and South Fair Oaks Avenue for a secondary search. Atwood Drive and the area is really pretty cool, but I'd probably give Willy Street the edge thanks to the Central Park and all of the events it hosted last year."
madisonwi,36th5q,FatBikeFanatic,1 point,Fri May 22 01:11:48 2015 UTC,"If you've got a bike, the distance between Willy and Atwood areas can be quite meaningless due to the trail that follows straight through both neighborhoods.  As a counterpoint, I prefer the Atwood restaurants and bars, plus the river and lake access is wonderful, even if just for a stroll with the dog. And as much as I like the Willy St Co-Op, the Jenny St Market can sell alcohol (and does so—really really well), so there's that too.  To each their own, though. Both excellent neighborhoods."
madisonwi,36th5q,theoryface,7,Fri May 22 21:38:31 2015 UTC,"Anywhere Downtown. I'd suggest East washington until you get to First street, the Atwood area closest to atwood ave. Stay off campus unless you like college kids. The bassett neighborhood and Vilas neighborhoods are nice. They're a mix of families/college kids."
madisonwi,36th5q,DDRExtremist247,3,Fri May 22 01:06:14 2015 UTC,Agree with everyone else. Downtown is where you want to be especially if you work close to there. There are a lot of new construction apartments that have been completed in the last year. I would check them out. the buildings though might end on the pricy side. One idea is since you are moving here during summer look for a cheaper sublet for the summer Students should have a month or two off still. Then you can do some calmer search. Going away from campus but still downtown can help. Students drive up prices for the walking distance.
madisonwi,36th5q,seigetnk178,3,Fri May 22 00:52:16 2015 UTC,"My question to you guys at /r/madisonwi is for a single no kids person who likes keeping up with local events (music, art, festivals, etc.) where should I be looking to live?

madisonwi,36odjx,killcpm,5,Wed May 20 21:21:20 2015 UTC,Pennsylvania tried something similar to this when it took over the Philadelphia schools and created the School Reform Commission. It did not work in the slightest. This is bad legislation based on a failed idea.
madisonwi,36odjx,IDreamOfRedditing,2,Thu May 21 12:53:35 2015 UTC,"independent commissioner would be able to convert the three lowest-performing schools to private voucher or independent charter schools in the first year and then up to five more schools each of the following years.   The way I read  that is the bottom schools get converted to private schools each year, under a republican controlled commissioner, in a in a democrat district. Until all schools are converted to private schools.  All the while, getting rid of all those pesky liberal teachers with their ideas about contracts, and education, and standards.  Stupidest thing about this is,  tnot management that makes a poorly performing school, it's the general poverty of the area (with a few isolated exceptions) This is, ironically, a republican wet dream, voted on at 1:30 AM."

madisonwi,36odjx,yelper,2,Wed May 20 21:42:14 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard about it, but honestly it doesn't seem like that big of a deal. If your school consistently demonstrates the worst results, radical change is probably necessary. As the article says, MMSD does not even meet the criteria right now."
madisonwi,36odjx,new-money,7,Wed May 20 22:07:10 2015 UTC,"Right, but who determines the criteria... an ""independent comissioner""?  What's the recourse?    There seems to be a bunch of goofiness, especially with no real plan once a district is 'blown up.'"
madisonwi,36odjx,yelper,0,Wed May 20 22:34:27 2015 UTC,"Well, we know that one of the criteria is school performance. I am assuming that the criteria has some basis, as the article does not go into any detail. But it sounds like the independent commissioner is not the one determining the criteria... he/she will come in after the criteria is met and start making drastic changes, which seems completely reasonable to me. If the schools are bad enough to consistently rank dead last you can't expect them to suddenly make significant progress. Getting an outsider in there will help them make some tough decisions that current staff might not be willing to make."

madisonwi,36nzsa,madtowner11,1 point,Wed May 20 20:04:16 2015 UTC,"I have a very old garage original to when the house was built (1925) so the doors are not secured (nor do they even close all the way).  They simply opened the garage door and strolled out.    After talking to my neighbors, they indicate that it has happened to each of them at least once in their years on the street.  Best advice is to lock up your bikes even if you think they are safe in the garage."

madisonwi,36nogs,JKibbs,1 point,Wed May 20 19:19:18 2015 UTC,This.  Want to meet other musicians?  Go to shows and talk to people.
madisonwi,36nogs,RandomPrecision1,3,Thu May 21 03:05:20 2015 UTC,"To find other musicians looking for bands, you can always check out open mics and open jams around town.  They often have a particular theme/genre, but the folks who attend may also be into other sorts of music.  So while I don't think you'll hear punk at many open mics...some folks who attend may also be into it. :)  I haven't been to as many in a while, but I think these all still run.  Disclaimer: I'm probably biased towards folk / blues stuff in what I know about:   There's an open jam Monday nights at Mr. Roberts downtown, kind of an anything-goes jam. They've got a kit and other instruments set up There's an open mic for original songs Tuesdays at the Froth House There's a thing Wednesday nights at the Badger Bowl where local and touring blues groups play a show - it's not really open like the others, but folks have been invited to sit in before The Knuckle Down Saloon has a mix of jams on Wednesday nights - I think they do bluegrass some weeks and country on others now There's an open blues jam at the Knuckle Down Saloon on Thursday nights (kind of like ""real"" blues, I don't think they'd take quite as well to like blues-rock shredding) - they've also got a drum kit and maybe extra instruments/amps, but I bring my own guitar+amp There's an open mic / jam at Christy's Landing also on Thursdays (I've never actually been there though) There are / used to be different-themed acoustic jams Sundays at the Froth House - like maybe blues one week, bluegrass the next, cajun the next or something There's a jam at Funk's in Fitchburg on Sunday nights that has a few bands play, then there's kind of an open jam where anyone can get up - they've got a kit, but I think everyone uses their own instrument+amp Tuvalu in Verona occasionally has acoustic open mics and circle jams - I think they're once a month on Fridays   Anyway, I didn't mean to write a novel, but I've jammed with folks at some of those, and sometimes made bands or other connections with them.  There's also a /r/madisonmusic sub, but it's not the liveliest.  Of course, you'll probably meet people of any genre at a show of that genre.  I guess it's the difference between finding punk folks and figuring out which are musicians, versus finding musicians and finding which ones are into punk. :)"

It's in Rio, WI (about 35min drive).   If you need some help getting there, you should post in the We Make Music Happen facebook group.   Camping, TONS of live music, beer, various degrees of nudity - we've got it all. I will 100% guarantee you'll make at least 24 musician friends in the first 24 hours.

Yeah this is one you should have held back and did research on. If a pawn shop is offering you $35 for a single DVD it is a huge signal that the DVD is worth way more than they are offering.

Very nice facilities as well and the RO's (if they're there) don't really care much what you do as long as you're safe.  Not restricted in rate of fire (unless you're out of control) and not restricted to just bench shooting.  Really can't be beat for $10 a trip."

It's $20 for all day, only two lanes but it's usually dead during the week. They only take cash and I only had a card. They said, ""Well, don't worry about it. Go out and have a good time, just promise you'll come back to shoot again."" Pretty cool. The guy walked me out to the range and said, ""Well we don't have too many rules. We assume everyone is an adult and wants to stay uninjured. Just be safe.""   Not a bad option when the sheriff's range is only open on the weekend."

madisonwi,36eu9p,name_with_a_y,3,Mon May 18 23:41:30 2015 UTC,Yeah but they also have cheaper stones and this is the best suggestion you'll get. Otherwise you'd have to pay a lapidary worker which is someone who cuts stones and they wouldn't do such a job for less than several hundred dollars.

I  was astonished how  little food I got for $12 but a mix-up in the kitchen would explain it."

madisonwi,36bim1,coriander0192,7,Mon May 18 05:16:05 2015 UTC,"...umm, that's not the case. The boycotts started over executives from Johnsonville donating to Walker in the election, and during that troubled spring anyone who ever donated to Walker was targeted. The Johnsonville execs gave to Walker and other republicans for years.   However there's one big flaw in this argument - the Johnsonville brats consumed are all donated for free.  If you want to boycott Johnsonville, fine. I avoid them when possible myself when buying brats which is easy to do in this state with plenty of other local brats to buy. But boycotting the festival that raises thousands of dollars for local charities because they donated the product is stupid.   Also, last years reason for boycotting, the fact that the metcalfe's added a stage for Christian music is rather asinine too. There's 3 other stages with every kind of music."

madisonwi,367u5f,TomTheGeek,-19,Sun May 17 03:54:25 2015 UTC,I agree with you. It's hard to take Madison (or any events therein) seriously when you have people like this.

If you're just looking for good stuff to do after work, I highly recommend hanging out on the University Terrace, listening to a band if there is one.  Tuesday nights are movies on the Terrace.  There are a ton of good restaurants, which you may well know already."

madisonwi,36bljy,LongUsername,2,Mon May 18 18:20:15 2015 UTC,"So around Verona itself:   Gray's Tide House: pretty good brewpub.  South east side of Verona. Draft House.  Haven't been there in a while, but remember it being pretty good but crowded. Food & Beer. North side of Verona. Wisconsin Brewing Company. Lots of good beer. South east side of Verona. Riley Tavern: Solid old-school small town tavern.  Serve food as well as alcohol. Just west of Verona in the town of Riley. Grumpy Troll (Mount Horeb): Good brewpub with a good fish fry.    New Glarus brewery isn't far from Verona and is well known for their brews.  Old Sugar Distillery is just east of the capitol and makes some fine spirits.  Otherwise, others will point out all the great stuff downtown.  It would help to know where you're staying; a lot of Epic people actually stay on Madison's far west side because Verona doesn't currently have enough hotel rooms (there's a MAJOR hotel going in to try to take advantage of this).   If you're staying near Middleton, you could go to the Mustard Museum just to say you've been."
madisonwi,367fbp,ChefJLH,44,Sat May 16 22:05:30 2015 UTC,"Very much depends on what you're looking for.  Unique toppings? Ians.  Well-made order-in-with-a-beer? Roman Candle.  Thin crust Sicilian-style? Pizza Brutta.  Thin crust gourmet? Grampas.  I've had Salvatore's once and it was outstanding, too. I just live way closer to Grampas and Roman Candle."
madisonwi,367fbp,hobbular,4,Sat May 16 22:20:25 2015 UTC,"Cosigned everything, and Grampa's is great, but Greenbush's thin crust gourmet is even better. My favorite pizza in Madison."
madisonwi,367fbp,readinginbed,0,Sun May 17 02:14:25 2015 UTC,"Also only been to Greenbush once - but very good. Only two complaints: a bit heavy on the cornmeal on the underside of the pizza, and (completely NOT their fault) there was an obnoxious toddler dogging my table the entire time I was eating and it completely ruined the experience for me."
madisonwi,367fbp,hobbular,0,Sun May 17 02:18:45 2015 UTC,"Definitely give it another shot. Did you have the signature pizza? I'm vegetarian now but daydream of it! It also has the best beer, wine, and cocktail lists anywhere in Madison-- they're well known for their bourbon expertise. Cheers!"
madisonwi,367fbp,readinginbed,2,Sun May 17 02:26:44 2015 UTC,"Pizza Brutta isn't the only place to get Italian-style pizza (because that is truly what it is). You can also go to the place under Capital Fitness (used to be called Naples 13, I think they changed names) or Cafe Porta Alba in Hilldale mall.

madisonwi,367fbp,wimadison,5,Sun May 17 01:34:02 2015 UTC,"My wife and I have been searching out good NY style pizza for the last 15 year. The best was probably at a little place on the corner of Broom and Johnson right off State St. Sadly, they closed years ago and I don't even remember the name. Pizza Di Roma is what my wife (NJ native) calls ""Mall Pizza"". The style is authentically NY, it's just not very good. Honestly, a basic pie from Ian's is your best bet. The crust isn't 100% right but overall it's our favorite when we crave NY style."

madisonwi,367fbp,Hosko817,3,Sun May 17 15:01:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I ordered from them weekly when they were out on Junction, and I agree, it was the closest thing to New York style I'd had in a long time.  They didn't last very long on the west side, I don't know if they moved again or closed or what.  Such a shame."

madisonwi,3633y1,dartmancometh,10,Fri May 15 18:16:29 2015 UTC,Does anyone have any links that provide some actual analysis here?  This seems like a pretty large spike in violent crime and I would be interested to understand it better.
madisonwi,3633y1,nickfantana,5,Sat May 16 00:02:00 2015 UTC,"Sorry that I'm ignorant about this, but can someone paint a picture for me of what's going on in these shootings? If it's gang-related, are people seeking out other people in gangs to shoot at, and missing them? Are they shooting at residences that rival gangs are living in? Thanks..."
madisonwi,3633y1,josephbuttons,4,Sat May 16 01:26:41 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that it is gang-related. this is based on a few comments that I have seen in articles related to the shootings in which a police spokesman mentions that the individuals are ""targeting"" each other. The ironic part is that after all these shootings I don't think there has been a single fatality.  Also, ironic is that the MPD has not arrested a single person responsible for any of these shootings.  Every report reads fairly similarly: Multiple reports of shots fired.. Police recovered shell casing.. Nobody was injured/someone had a non life-threatening injury. Case in point: http://www.cityofmadison.com/police/newsroom/incidentreports/incident.cfm?id=17230  It is sad to think that it might take an innocent bystander dying or being severely injured for more action to be taken. I mean I am sure the police are doing all they can, but it seems pretty obvious they do not have the necessary resources / are not properly trained to deal with these sorts of crimes.  Edit: Added link to new shots fired report that follows the typical format."
madisonwi,3633y1,tymlord,0,Sat May 16 01:54:14 2015 UTC,"MPD let this slide for quite awhile saying that ""it isn't a problem yet so we're not going to worry about it"". This was from a community meeting in the Eken Park neighborhood in the late 90s. Eventually things just rapidly escalated because it was more comfortable to ignore warning signs."
madisonwi,3633y1,frezik,7,Sat May 16 04:55:51 2015 UTC,"During most of the period since the late-90s, violent crime dropped in this city. In fact, even with more recent events, I wouldn't be surprised if Madison is still an exceptionally safe city. That said, it is clearly time to do something so Madison can keep that reputation."
madisonwi,3633y1,tymlord,1 point,Sat May 16 16:56:10 2015 UTC,"There was less violent crime during that time, although a lot of things went been unreported. The increase in crime could be seen coming awhile back (that doesn't mean it was at that level, just that signs were there and ignored). In general yes Madison is a safe city that is still suffering from making the transition from the responsibilities of being a small town to those of a city. There is still a nostalgia for how things were and difficulty grasping how thongs are."
madisonwi,3633y1,layer555,5,Sat May 16 19:33:45 2015 UTC,"The problem is much more complex than the police ""letting it slide""  The police need information and evidence to act on crimes. When they arrive at a scene to find no witnesses and a handful of spent shells there isn't exactly much they can do.  The fact of the matter is the communities know where these gangs are, who's in them, and why they're fighting, but they don't talk to the police, not even because they don't trust them, but because they fear violence from the gangs themselves.  The police aren't lazy, they're powerless. Imo that's much scarier."
madisonwi,3633y1,tymlord,2,Sat May 16 21:45:19 2015 UTC,I agree that right now they are ill prepared and that the current social trend doesn't work in their favor (and is really self defeating for the community as a whole). It didn't help to have a police chief that openly ignored issues and concerns and made national news for putting having his handgun discharge in his oven (he was hiding it from his grandchildren).
madisonwi,3633y1,layer555,-1,Sat May 16 23:58:38 2015 UTC,"The ironic part is that after all these shootings I don't think there has been a single fatality.   Not really, bangers have guns but they don't really know how to use them. Also black market guns are often damaged or defective. Top that all off with the fact that these kids are more interested in intimidating each other than actually killing each other and everything comes into focus."
madisonwi,3633y1,Mousybj,2,Sat May 16 21:53:47 2015 UTC,I remember working in a city as a paramedic as gangs were moving into that city- there were shootings and stabbings every night. It makes me wonder if that's what's going on here.
madisonwi,3633y1,theoryface,1 point,Sat May 16 21:18:56 2015 UTC,"No preventable loss of life is tolerable. This disgusts me.  Don't be in a gang. If you think your kid is in a gang, do everything in your power to scare him the hell out of it."
madisonwi,3633y1,layer555,3,Fri May 15 21:20:37 2015 UTC,"If a kid is in a gang, they either have no parents, or their parents don't care."
madisonwi,3633y1,madman86,-2,Sat May 16 19:53:24 2015 UTC,Mainly low income areas. Most likely gang-related.
madisonwi,3633y1,Porkstacker,8,Fri May 15 18:39:06 2015 UTC,"The guy who got shot in his home this week was in a solidly middle class, historically low crime area.  This affects everyone."
madisonwi,3633y1,madman86,4,Fri May 15 21:47:42 2015 UTC,"I agree, there was a shooting just 2 blocks from my home this year. I'm not saying it isn't a problem, clearly it is. A lot of the clusters though are in or near low income areas."
madisonwi,3633y1,FatBikeFanatic,2,Fri May 15 21:55:00 2015 UTC,"A lot of the clusters though are in or near low income areas.    And that makes it less of a problem?   Besides, it's happening much more frequently now in densely populated areas like West Towne Mall, State Street, Mineral Drive, etc., which are probably some of the most densely populated areas of town, so the logic of trying to marginalize it by saying it is mostly in or near low income areas doesn't make sense in and of itself.  A quick look at the map suggests that 1) it's not all in low income areas (there's not a single shot fired on Allied Drive or Badger Drive, Madison's most notorious low income neighborhoods), and 2) it seems to be out of control."
madisonwi,3633y1,madman86,4,Fri May 15 23:12:38 2015 UTC,Re read the entire comment and then tell me where I Said it isn't a problem. You will note that I said the exact opposite. MPD definitely needs to do more about it.
madisonwi,3633y1,Porkstacker,1 point,Sat May 16 00:55:03 2015 UTC,"Ahh, gotcha. Sorry. It is mostly happening in low income areas, it's just that I've heard way too many people use that as an excuse to throw up a ""not my problem"" attitude and pretend everything's fine."

madisonwi,3627wa,gAlienLifeform,-2,Fri May 15 14:03:13 2015 UTC,"I tend to think that folks who think Madison's police department is full of social workers wanting to hold your hand either don't look poor or are white. I'm white, but I did have the experience of moving from an affluent part of Madison to a much poorer area on the East Side. I was surprised how much attention you get from police depending on what neighborhood you live in. There is no doubt in my mind that Madison police are much more racist/classist compared to other police in other metropolitan areas. Good luck being a young black man driving a shitty car in Madison.    What's a solution? I think body cams would be a great start so we can have better documentation of this racism/classism and start firing the police officers that are the worse offenders. Having more transparent evaluations of the police officers we hire won't be easy, but I think it's essential that we at least start the process."
madisonwi,3627wa,reimannk,21,Fri May 15 20:39:49 2015 UTC,"It couldn't possibly be scrutiny in those neighborhoods for the reason that those neighborhoods actually have higher rates of crimes occurring in them, could it?"
madisonwi,3627wa,Rignite,7,Fri May 15 20:58:02 2015 UTC,"Will a young poor person driving a shitty car statistically be more likely to commit a crime? I would bet on it. I absolutely agree that more crime happens in poorer neighborhoods in Madison. What I have a problem with is a scenario where you could have two people with identical behaviors treated drastically differently by law enforcement just because they are profiled as a ""high risk individual"" because of their skin color or class. A young black man smoking dope should have just as much of a chance to be prosecuted for that crime as a white college student smoking dope. The reality is that the Madison Police Department is extraordinarily disproportionally heavy handed with how they enforce laws for certain groups of people."
madisonwi,3627wa,reimannk,2,Fri May 15 22:43:11 2015 UTC,Madison Police Department is extraordinarily disproportionally heavy handed with how they enforce laws for certain groups of people.   Do you have any evidence to support this claim?
madisonwi,3627wa,kebababab,5,Sat May 16 01:12:19 2015 UTC,This article talks about how Madison arrests at least 9 times more black people than white people: http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/11/18/ferguson-black-arrest-rates/19043207/  This is one of the higher disparities in the country.
madisonwi,3627wa,reimannk,1 point,Sat May 16 01:59:06 2015 UTC,"Statistically, black people commit more crimes than others. Madison, being a progressive department, commits more resources to poorer neighborhoods which happen to have significantly more black people.   You could reduce arrests of black people by not responding when the Tony Robinsons of the city go on a drug induced violent rampage...But such a policy would be against Madison's core values."
madisonwi,3627wa,kebababab,1 point,Sat May 16 02:11:27 2015 UTC,"Again, the problem is how blacks in Madison seem to be disproportionally prosecuted relative to the crime that is committed. I'm not arguing that blacks commit less crime."

madisonwi,3627wa,ghostly_harmless,2,Sat May 16 05:04:03 2015 UTC,Possibly. Is it an impossible scenario?
madisonwi,3627wa,Rignite,-1,Sat May 16 07:44:05 2015 UTC,I am telling you that we would need those statistics to draw such a conclusion. Black people commit more crimes....I couldn't tell you at what rate.
madisonwi,3627wa,kebababab,3,Sat May 16 12:13:16 2015 UTC,"I can't disagree that they are going to be more vigilant in high crime areas.  I think body cameras would be a great start, but they can be turned on an off.  I don't know what the answer is.  Advanced body cameras with NFC built in so anytime the officer is outside of the car, they get turned on.  But then I really don't want video of them going to the bathroom either.  There has to be a better way."

madisonwi,3627wa,aertime,2,Fri May 15 16:15:36 2015 UTC,We should just be like the rest of the developed world and base fines on an individual's income.
madisonwi,3627wa,layer555,-4,Sat May 16 19:56:53 2015 UTC,They could raise the court fees to a million dollars and I could still afford it. I don't break the law and never have to worry about court fees. And I didn't worry about them in my twenties and early thirties when I had no pot to piss in. Poor people don't have trouble with court fees. Criminals do.
madisonwi,3627wa,Kurtze,7,Sat May 16 02:41:16 2015 UTC,"Alright, Ill bite.  Imagine you're poor and you get pulled over for having expired tags on your car. You've been meaning to update your registration, but haven't saved up enough yet. You're past due on an oil change as it is, but you rely on your car to get to your part time job. Now you have the cost of registration and a ticket to deal with. You barely make enough to afford rent and food as it is.   Unfortunately, you never get around to paying that ticket or updating your registration. You get pulled over and learn there's a warrant out for your arrest and the cops take you in. You acquire all of the fees of processing on top of your ticket. You have no way to pay any of it. Congratulations. You're now a locked up ""criminal""."
madisonwi,3627wa,aertime,-1,Sat May 16 02:58:59 2015 UTC,I don't have to imagine that. I lived in a state with emission standards and I had an old POS that couldn't pass it. And I got real jammed up on the fees and they towed the car and added fees there. But what is your answer? Not have penalties for failing to comply with regulations that everyone else has to comply with? You have listed really two failures. Failure to pay the fee when required. Then continuing to not be I compliance and let a very predictable warrant be issued. I've  lived very close to the edge. And the only solution is to get yourself in a better place.
madisonwi,3627wa,Kurtze,5,Sat May 16 03:10:19 2015 UTC,Exactly. Not being poor is the solution.
madisonwi,3627wa,aertime,-1,Sat May 16 03:12:14 2015 UTC,"Well to a certain extent yes. I went to college over years while working two jobs and trying to raise a special needs kid. I'm not rich at this point but I make about 50k. And I don't fear the next day struggles like I used to. Its not easy. But it can be done with a little planning and hard work. And when you are poor and vulnerable you take pains not to get caught for any stupid shit. I don't think I ever sped in that piece of shit car, not even once. And I'm not a saint or special, just an ordinary guy doing the best I can."
madisonwi,3627wa,Kurtze,2,Sat May 16 14:24:30 2015 UTC,And the only solution is to get yourself in a better place.   I suppose you broke out of poverty all by yourself with no financial help from anyone whatsoever.

Quite frankly, no.   I don't know, the unemployment rate is startlingly high for Blacks in Dane County, I imagine not having good job opportunities is a factor.  The answer is highly contested and complex, I don't know if I have any answers outside of the mainstream answers ie: Education, Jobs, Family unit support.

madisonwi,35ykdb,goosiegirl,6,Thu May 14 23:38:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Wisconsin hasn't given its electoral votes to a Republican candidate since Reagan. In presidential years, when everybody bothers to show up, our state is voting more Democratic than they ever really have been--and senators' elections in those years tend to reflect that. It's the midterms when we screw it up. Fortunately, since Feingold will running in a presidential election this year, as opposed to last time, it seems like he's got a pretty solid chance."
madisonwi,35ykdb,anneoftheisland,5,Fri May 15 02:57:47 2015 UTC,"Feingold holds a substantial lead (9-16 points) in all early polling, and while Johnson has the advantages of an incumbent it also means there's little room for him to gain ground through gains in name recognition.  It's not a gimmie - they never are - but Johnson is in serious trouble. I wouldn't expect him to pull a lot of support from the national party, either.  Wisconsin has always been purple, I'm not sure it has trended right any more than the rest of the country."
madisonwi,35ykdb,fishsticks40,2,Thu May 14 23:03:39 2015 UTC,"A big change this time around is that Johnson has said he won't self finance this campaign. Considering he dumped eight million of his own money into the campaign last time, that's a huge change."

I mean, here in Madison it's very likely that he'll do well. But with his lost election in 2010 (as well as Scott Walker's double victories, ignoring the recall, because that's not the same), is it just that the conservative base in Wisconsin is more motivated to vote? I'm honestly curious what sort of change there was in 2010. More conservatives in general? Or just more motivation to vote?"
madisonwi,35ykdb,ms_ashes,19,Thu May 14 18:50:07 2015 UTC,"Feingold was voted out in the wave of anti-Obama furor that happened in 2010, helped in part by Walker defeating a weak candidate in Tom Barrett. The recall effort backfired, as everyone signed the petition, but many of them didn't vote, and the movement actually galvanized Walker's base for  both a recall victory in 2012, and a re-election against textbook ""Madison liberal"" Mary Burke in 2014. (Tammy Baldwin winning her Senate seat in 2012 was probably going to happen either way, but having the ghost of Tommy Thompson against you didn't hurt.)  Feingold has now been completely out of politics for six years. While it would've been nice to have him run for governor last year, his candidacy is going to wake up the Democratic Party, and hopefully stir up some strong Congressional candidates in districts like WI-1 (Paul Ryan) and WI-7 (Sean Duffy).   Add to all this that Johnson is a puppet candidate for ""job creators"" (big business interests who create lower middle class jobs and keep the wealth), and has done almost nothing in Washington except make dumb statements, and a Feingold victory is inevitable, IF PEOPLE VOTE!"
madisonwi,35ykdb,tommyjohnpauljones,3,Thu May 14 19:06:57 2015 UTC,"It was also a mid-term election. Generally turnout is significantly lower than a presidential election year, especially among those whose voting records tend to lean left."

madisonwi,35ykdb,ms_ashes,9,Thu May 14 20:06:43 2015 UTC,"2010 was a Republican windfall nationwide. Media-fired outrage machines created the likes of the Tea Party. In a non-presidential election when voter turnout is hugely lower, and the more pissed-off people always tend to be the ones voting. So in 2010 democrats stayed home and conservatives voted in droves. The same thing happened last fall, though to a far lesser extent. If Feingold hadn't had to stand for re-election in a non-presidential election year I find it unlikely Ron would've won.  Frankly, if Walker had been up for election/re-election in 2008 or 2012, or if the recall election had been concurrent with one of those elections, I think it's extremely likely we wouldn't be stuck with him either."

madisonwi,35ykdb,ms_ashes,2,Thu May 14 20:20:53 2015 UTC,"Feingold lost by a VERY slim margin to a relative unknown riding the Obama backlash in a non-presidential year.  Johnson is polling significantly below Feingold. Johnson has had 6 years in the senate an relatively little to show his constituents for it.  Feingold can point to the latest surveillance scandal and pretty much say ""See, I told you so!"".  He also has a reputation as someone who reaches across the aisle to get things done (McCain-Feingold, which depending on your view may have backfired with Citizen's United)"
madisonwi,35ykdb,LongUsername,2,Fri May 15 13:35:36 2015 UTC,"Just as a background as to why Wisconsin is a ""swing state"": As you're well aware, Madison and Dane County are STRONGLY Democrat (they went for Mondale in '84 and McGovern in '72 while the rest of the country was landsliding GOP). That ""blue block"" carries through SW Wisconsin (Monroe, Platteville, up to La Crosse), carrying a mix of college towns, farmers, and people with close ties to Madison. The only other Democrat strongholds in the state are the city of Milwaukee (black, Hispanic, strong union town) and the Indian reservations up north near Superior.  Going the other way, the folks that elected Walker and Ron Johnson live mostly in the Fox Valley (Green Bay, Oshkosh, Fond du Lac), the Twin Cities suburbs near Hudson and River Falls, and the area between MKE and MSN, places like Waukesha and Oconomowoc, as well as many of the northern Milwaukee suburbs like Mequon and Cedarburg.  Those first two paragraphs give you roughly equal populations, depending on how you calculate them. Figure those as 40% for each Feingold and Johnson on average.   The remaining 20% is where the ""Swing"" comes from. That's Kenosha and Racine counties, the Eau Claire/Chippewa Valley, and the central Wisconsin cities like Stevens Point. Likewise, expect to see a lot of campaigning in those areas.  This is a VERY rough estimate but it should help lay out how the state is divided."

Whatever chance Feingold had running against Johnson again will be eliminated by Wisconsin going all in for Republicans with a shot at a Wisconsin president (which is another reason why, if the Republicans are smart, they'll make sure Walker is their nominee... it'll get them at least one northern state they haven't had in a while, probably a few more).  edit: you guys are so positive. wish I could be. except for the downvote thing. that wasn't so positive."
madisonwi,35ykdb,potentpotablesplease,6,Thu May 14 19:51:35 2015 UTC,"I think Walker's bound to have a Rick Perry-esque moment in a debate sometime. I'll give him credit for trying to build up his foreign chops early on, but he's just not a broad enough thinker to handle it when he gets knocked off message. In state contests he's been able to stay on message quite well thanks to a demoralized state Dem party and weak opponents. Once he's got to run against real opponents and deal with national press, he's going to have some real flubs that could easily cost him the nomination."

madisonwi,35ykdb,Abzug,4,Fri May 15 01:47:45 2015 UTC,I don't think Walker can guarantee Wisconsin at all. Half the reason he won his recall was because people were sick of hearing about it and Barrett was a weak candidate from a city that the rest of the state has little admiration for.

madisonwi,35z79q,new-money,2,Thu May 14 20:59:02 2015 UTC,They claim there isn't enough room for one. They just re-did the intersection like 2 years ago and left it pretty much the same.
madisonwi,35z79q,n609mike,1 point,Fri May 15 14:52:37 2015 UTC,"It's a cluster fuck, but I actually think it works well. Even for bikers it's a very easy intersection to navigate now."
madisonwi,35z79q,n609mike,6,Fri May 15 16:08:54 2015 UTC,My pet peeve is in residential areas where a lot of bus commuters tend to park. The curbs are not repainted yellow to designate the no parking areas close to corners. People park 2 feet from the corner then I cant see around their car to enter the intersection.
madisonwi,35z79q,layer555,3,Fri May 15 02:33:51 2015 UTC,Any examples? Looking for specifics here.
madisonwi,35z79q,mooge,6,Fri May 15 15:04:14 2015 UTC,Pretty much every corner not new or downtown need a new paint job.
madisonwi,35z79q,yelper,16,Fri May 15 02:48:03 2015 UTC,"Madison is a myriad of one way streets and confusing intersections. Most of the sud-divisions are also just a lattice of circular roads and dead ends.  I've always joked Madison's slogan should be ""You can't get there from here.""  As a cyclist/skater I really can't stand the condition of some of our streets."
madisonwi,35z79q,588-2300_empire,3,Thu May 14 20:25:45 2015 UTC,We need road infrastructure badly. Just read that Wisconsin ranks 3rd worst for road quality in the US.
madisonwi,35z79q,b-muff,2,Thu May 14 21:28:06 2015 UTC,Wisconsin also has the most paved highway miles out of any state in the US.. so there's something to consider as well.
madisonwi,35z79q,aintgotany,3,Thu May 14 21:36:01 2015 UTC,"Per area? Per capita? Because I assure you that other states, such as California, have more miles overall."
madisonwi,35z79q,b-muff,5,Thu May 14 19:24:07 2015 UTC,"Lol I work for the city of Madison although  I am not the person who can make decisions about any of this. If you have any real problems, you can always contact the department. They listen to ALL the complaints-crazy or legitimate and they do a lot to make the city safer for cars, pedestrians and bikers. I don't think they will take suggestions from reddit though :)"
madisonwi,35z79q,b-muff,3,Fri May 15 14:53:43 2015 UTC,"Can you suggest a method for us to share these comments? A lot of them aren't complaints per se, rather they're just nonsensical things that could be done better. The report a problem link someone else shared doesn't seem like it would be suitable for all of these. Honestly it would be great if you would subtly share this with some of your peers!  Edit: If all that came from this was some arrows at Baldwin/E.Wash where OP suggested, this would be amazing!"
madisonwi,35z79q,aertime,6,Fri May 15 20:07:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the city isn't going to do anything unless they hear directly from concerned citizens. A gripe thread on reddit isn't really a credible source of issues for them. Even if you don't have a complaint but more of a suggestion, you can report it on the city website."

madisonwi,35z79q,tmntman,3,Thu May 14 21:26:47 2015 UTC,I think they are aware of the big ones that people mentioned. You have to remember that there is a pretty strict budget so some of the minor issues have to wait. I'm not about to tell my bosses what anonymous people on the Internet are complaining about lol
madisonwi,35z79q,aintgotany,2,Fri May 15 03:48:39 2015 UTC,Hoping they add arrows to East Wash and Baldwin. I've almost been sideswiped several times while trying to go straight from the left lane while others are trying to pass me in the intersection from the right lane.
madisonwi,35z79q,kecos,5,Fri May 15 13:18:29 2015 UTC,"I love this thread.   The intersection of Fairchild and W. Wash is red for a solid 10 seconds in both directions at every light change. Drives me bananas.  Also, the new blinking yellow left arrows at Baldwin and Johson/Gorham are stupid. I would hate to live there with those things blinking all day. Isn't a solid green the same as a green+blinking yellow? C'mon people..."
madisonwi,35z79q,filteringdefaults,7,Thu May 14 21:30:49 2015 UTC,That was done after a German tourist was run over at that intersection.  Now it automatically allows time between the lights for people in the crosswalks.
madisonwi,35z79q,slayerhk47,5,Thu May 14 21:40:23 2015 UTC,Sad. I guess that makes sense. It is a big intersection.

madisonwi,35z79q,MadChris,3,Fri May 15 03:45:45 2015 UTC,Even the roads are private property. I guess the property owner didn't want to spend the money to fix them until he had to.  Some of those potholes where huge.
madisonwi,35z79q,JS_88,1 point,Fri May 15 04:00:39 2015 UTC,And there is the opposite of west wash. Two tiny little lanes in each direction by sears.
madisonwi,35z79q,themaskedlemur,5,Fri May 15 04:06:25 2015 UTC,The light at Park and Wingra has Fresnel lenses because it's actually two intersections.  They don't want you to be confused by the signal from the second intersection.
madisonwi,35z79q,Arguss,6,Thu May 14 23:22:29 2015 UTC,"When you're on 1st turning left on East Wash towards the capitol. That damned green left turn light goes yellow after about 4 seconds. Most of the time, the first car through doesn't make it before it starts turning yellow."
madisonwi,35z79q,angrydeuce,2,Fri May 15 13:50:15 2015 UTC,1st and East Wash in general is pretty much a nightmare from any direction.

Should I just pre-emptively get into the bus lane? I mean, that's what everyone behind me is doing and I don't want to cut them off.."
madisonwi,35z79q,aintgotany,4,Fri May 15 02:32:08 2015 UTC,"The intersection of Gammon and Watts near Woodmans.  Heading east on Watts, you actually have 2 lanes going straight as you enter the intersection, but only one lane at the other side of the intersection, which forces people to fight how to merge whilst in the middle of an intersection.  Heading west on Watts. There are 3 lanes entering the intersection: a lane that turns left and goes straight, a lane that goes straight, and a lane that's right-hand turn only. But the first two lanes, which both go straight, don't actually line up with the two lanes at the other side of the intersection, so as a result the center lane often goes into the left lane on the other side of the intersection, in effect performing an unannounced merge in front of you while crossing the intersection.  Heading south on Gammon. Can't actually turn left into the gas station on the corner because of the median; instead, you have to wait for a protected left onto Watts and then turn left against the line of cars lined up at the intersection, waiting for some kind soul to left you break through.   Same thing with heading north on Gammon and trying to turn into the Subway."
madisonwi,35z79q,4AM_Mooney_SoHo,3,Fri May 15 14:28:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I lived over off of Watts for almost 10 years and I hated traffic over there towards the end.  Too many people and not enough road.  I've actually found it easier to take the left preceding Watts (Seybold) when heading south on Gammon and drive through the Wendy's/Arbys parking lot to get to that BP.  The turn arrow there seems to go off fairly quickly once someone pulls up there (much to the chagrin of all the people traveling north on Gammon towards the beltline).  Fuck trying to get in from Watts...even if the person in the left turn lane is kind enough to leave a gap, the people going straight or right there probably won't.  Odana Rd. is plagued with the same types of problems.  That entire area clearly wasn't designed with the amount of traffic that is now traveling on it in mind.  The arrow to turn left onto Watts from North Gammon is ridiculously short, like 2-3 cars, and you pretty much have to be 'that guy' waiting until the light turns red to turn if you try to take a left on a green without the arrow."
madisonwi,35z79q,Jeneveve,8,Sat May 16 17:30:41 2015 UTC,This intersection near east town mall. The worst intersection in the city by far.
madisonwi,35z79q,Really_Like_Pancakes,3,Fri May 15 16:04:10 2015 UTC,The massive traffic circles back on Zeier are also a clusterfuck.
madisonwi,35z79q,ScottWalkerSucks,3,Sat May 16 03:30:11 2015 UTC,They are way better than the clusterfuck that was there before.
madisonwi,35z79q,Cessnateur,1 point,Sat May 16 11:55:46 2015 UTC,Not to mention the mess of cars in front of the pancake house because of folks who want to turn left onto east wash but get stuck there because of the light.

madisonwi,35z79q,krusten,3,Fri May 15 03:47:37 2015 UTC,I just want to be able to make U-turns from the center turn lane. It's allowed in other states and it works fine.
madisonwi,35z79q,Mswindupbird89,4,Fri May 15 13:34:22 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of issues with the roads here would be solved if instead of having islands in the middle of roads they just had one long turn lane in the middle. It's insanely frustrating dealing with a situation where you miss a turn and then have to spend 10 minutes driving around to legally get back and turn.  I once was going to pick up food from Chang Jiang on Gammon. I was driving east on Watts, and missed the turn. Then I had to drive north along Gammon, wait for a protected left into the West Towne Mall, turn into a parking lot, turn around, drive back down Gammon heading south, and turn right into Chang Jiang. The restaurant actually called me to ask if I was coming, it took so long."
madisonwi,35z79q,tmntman,5,Fri May 15 14:55:19 2015 UTC,"Random islands in the middle of streets.  For example, a few years ago they put in a circular island on North Baldwin, which is an already narrow residential street.  I don't notice much traffic going through here except buses.  So the already narrow street, made narrower by people parking on their side, made narrower still by this pointless island, means that two buses or large cars can't even pass each other without pulling over.  It must be a nightmare to plow any of these streets.  Also, the Wilson-Willy-John Nolen intersection.  If you're trying to turn left onto Wilson, there is no actual left turning lane, just a little painted section where people are supposed to pull over so that cars behind them going straight can continue on.  But most of the time people are either idiots or just don't drive in the area often enough to know the set up so they block everyone behind them for the entire light change. Happens every single rush hour."
madisonwi,35z79q,Mswindupbird89,7,Fri May 15 14:55:43 2015 UTC,"Oh god on that note with the Wilson-Willy-John Nolen intersection - when people are driving south on S. Blair, take a left onto Willy, and then take a sharp right into the Machinery Row parking lot, often cutting off the folks turning right onto Willy from John Nolen with a green arrow. Drives me nuts."
madisonwi,35z79q,Ayotte,7,Thu May 14 20:10:16 2015 UTC,"That entire area is a nightmare.  Also, trying to pull out of that parking lot onto Willy without cutting the path off for pedestrians and still seeing oncoming traffic is near impossible."
madisonwi,35z79q,Mswindupbird89,13,Thu May 14 22:39:06 2015 UTC,"In case you hadn't figured it out, those islands are there specifically to be annoying and difficult to get around because that slows down the traffic on those streets."
madisonwi,35z79q,MrTubes,5,Sat May 16 03:20:46 2015 UTC,"There's another one on Fordem near Johnson. Right next to a bus stop. If you try to squeeze past the bus, you feel like you're going to get destroyed if it starts moving again. That bus stop should be a good 15 feet earlier IMO."
madisonwi,35z79q,Ekoms420,7,Thu May 14 21:22:03 2015 UTC,"That particular island helps with pedestrians crossing to access the bus stops, so I like that it's there, but you're right - the bus stops need to be moved on either side."
madisonwi,35z79q,footballhead667,2,Fri May 15 02:48:50 2015 UTC,"I always get soooo pissed at those people who can't sneak over just a bit to the left to let us through.  Also, those islands make no sense."
madisonwi,35z79q,n609mike,2,Fri May 15 02:52:03 2015 UTC,"I've seen them tear up a road JUST to put one in too.  Are they that desperate to spend their money or what? Edit: The islands, I mean."
madisonwi,35z79q,n609mike,3,Fri May 15 00:48:28 2015 UTC,"They did that on Milwaukee St east of 51 a couple years ago. As a cyclist I think they're terrible because they squeeze cars and bikes into a much narrower area. Throw in a car turning right and it's a mess where before there was enough room for a car to duck in behind me and turn right, me to go straight and a car to fit to my left going straight. I think on Milwaukee they wanted to slow traffic down and push more traffic onto Cottage Grove."
madisonwi,35z79q,vatoniolo,2,Thu May 14 21:34:25 2015 UTC,"I live at Baldwin and E Washington and I have to cross this intersection every day-sometimes numerous times. It feels very dangerous as a pedestrian. I am also somewhat of a night owl and I have discovered traffic control (red lights) has not been initiated early enough on E Washington . (It can be nerve wrecking crossing East Washington at 4:45am on a Monday when nobody can see you and nobody is paying attention). I've noticed the biggest danger as far as motorists is concerned comes from the south-bound Baldwin street traffic. It seems many people are in a rush to avoid the traffic on E Johnson and E Gorham and they do not pay much attention when they pull on to E Washington.  In addition, the current design of E Mifflin does not stress the importance of a bike path. I see many motorists speed through the intersections on East Mifflin Street without hesitating."
madisonwi,35z79q,bighootay,2,Thu May 14 21:45:37 2015 UTC,"As far as #1 goes, these are called optically programmed signal heads. Basically, they're placed at high-volume intersections that are close in proximity to one other. So when you're headed south on Park St, you don't want to see the light at Plaenert turn green & bomb through a red light that you missed at Park. Similarly when driving north, you don't want to see Wingra's light change and think it's Plaenert's. There are screens that are set to only allow the light to visible once you pass through the nearer intersection. It's just an extra safety measure.  For #2, I just keep an eye out for blinkers. But yeah that shit's annoying."
madisonwi,35z79q,aintgotany,3,Thu May 14 21:35:07 2015 UTC,Your number 1 peev is so drivers do not get confused as to which light is for you.
madisonwi,35z79q,killcpm,2,Thu May 14 21:43:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know what you're trying to say, but my issue is that the lights themselves at both of these intersections need to be replaced with modern LEDs that you can actually see the entire time you're approaching. The lights they have give off a weird illusion of fading out as you get closer."
madisonwi,35z79q,anneoftheisland,4,Fri May 15 00:51:33 2015 UTC,So when you are traveling south on park and come up to wingra drive you only want to see the wingra drive light and not the Plaenert drive light. They have special lenses so they cannot be seen at certain distances. If they didnt have the special lenses a driver might see a green light at plaenert without seeing the red at wingra.

madisonwi,35zbcn,aertime,6,Fri May 15 12:33:31 2015 UTC,"A lot of these questions are addressed in the report, which people should read if they have concerns. The officer mentions that Robinson did not lose consciousness immediately after the shooting--he was awake and speaking (although slurred to the point where no one could understand what he was saying) for a minute or two after he was shot. The officer started CPR once Robinson lost consciousness, but that wasn't immediately after the shooting."

madisonwi,35zbcn,anneoftheisland,5,Fri May 15 15:49:19 2015 UTC,"Just because you shoot at someone with a pistol 7 times doesn't mean you hit them 7 times (even if you did, you have no way of knowing), nor does it mean it will stop them. Pistols are no guarantee of immediate incapacitation.  In Florida this January, some racist dude was shot 3 times by someone he was attacking. While it was 3 and not 7, if you look at the video, you can't even tell he's injured as he's making his escape. He ended up dieing later in a car crash."
madisonwi,35zbcn,cs556,-7,Fri May 15 23:54:24 2015 UTC,"I brought this up before, but the reason they claimed the cop couldn't use a taser is because there were no other officers present.  This video proves otherwise.  So...  what the fuck?  Also, WHY SEVEN SHOTS."
madisonwi,35zbcn,ScottWalkerSucks,18,Thu May 14 20:06:02 2015 UTC,"Getting shot isn't like the movies. It's fairly normal for even people who are completely sober to not feel the first bullet right away, or to barely feel it. If someone is on drugs, one or even two or three bullets often doesn't stop them immediately. Since it's impossible for the officer to be able to guess exactly how many bullets it'll take to bring (and keep) someone down, it's procedure to continue firing until they're sure the suspect is stopped. Unfortunately, the number of bullets it takes to visibly stop someone is often the number it takes to kill them.  It's a nice fantasy to think that there's a magical number of bullets out there that could stop a suspect from charging, protecting the life of the officer while ensuring that the suspect comes to no lasting harm. The reality is that every situation is different, there is no magical number, and we're asking officers to decide exactly what that number is in a matter of seconds in a high-pressure situation where they're operating with a fraction of the facts."

Etc. Etc.   That's just a fraction of the results that come up when you search for it."

madisonwi,35zbcn,ScottWalkerSucks,4,Fri May 15 15:58:51 2015 UTC,"In the previous posting of this, I was really surprised at how quickly the other officers came in to view. It just hasn't sat well with me. But also, I'm not an officer. I understand the need for split second decisions but it is also concerning that the situation was known (despite what was being heard in the house) and waiting would not seem to have taken much longer than an extra minute. This is obviously me still wishing for ways the outcome could have been different, so...I don't know."
madisonwi,35zbcn,Mhm426,11,Thu May 14 20:20:14 2015 UTC,"Kill is not the right word. The correct wording is, ""Shoot to stop the threat."" The definition of that is as simple as it sounds.

madisonwi,360gxp,SadPenisMatinee,1 point,Fri May 15 01:29:47 2015 UTC,"Theater: Are you heading down here now, or planning ahead for the summer? If you're coming in the summer, American Players Theatre in Spring Green is a great option--it's one of the best classical theater companies in the country, in a really pretty outdoor theater. Their season doesn't start until June, though, so if you're visiting now, it might not work. It's nearby the supremely weird House on the Rock and Frank Lloyd Wright's house, Taliesin, so you could make a day out of it.  Movies: On Monday nights in the summer, the Wisconsin Union plays movies outdoors on their terrace--it looks like this year's theme is transportation-themed movies. It's not a great place to go if you actually want to seriously watch the movies, since the crowd can be a little noisy and distracting, but it's fun if you just want to chill out in a beautiful setting, drink a beer, and have a communal experience with some other movie-watchers.  Sports: Summer's the slowest sports season for us--probably the biggest thing is the Mallards, which is collegiate/faux-minor league baseball--but the 56ers (soccer) and the Radicals (ultimate frisbee) both play in the summer too, depending on what you're into. If you're heading toward Milwaukee, Brewers games are always a fun time.  Other general good summer stuff: the farmer's market, Concerts on the Square, hiking at Devil's Lake."

madisonwi,35yz3j,madtownWI,12,Thu May 14 18:12:22 2015 UTC,"How immature of whoever was behind the camera. She reminded me of what bullies used to do in early grade school -- try everything and anything to get a response from whoever they're bullying, and if they do (which I am proud of the cops for ignoring her immaturity), the bullies would back off and act like they were innocent.   No matter how much you could hate police, there is absolutely no reason to act so immature and inconsiderate to another person. I dont see how acting like that could have even slightly helped the situation."

madisonwi,35ucwn,new-money,11,Wed May 13 16:46:54 2015 UTC,"I am thankful they are being peaceful, but if they are trying to gain support, that seems counter-productive, as it would anger/annoy people to varying degrees.  It would seem like it would turn a neutral or on-the-fence person against their cause (for the wrong reasons, but let's face it, it happens).  Is that really the best idea?  Basically I've seen a lot of people pissed off about this, and because of this blocked traffic they disagree with the protestors, instead of disagreeing with the protestors because of their actual message....if that makes any sense.  So in that sense I don't get why they think that's the best way to go about your protest."
madisonwi,35ucwn,BarkMingo,21,Wed May 13 21:12:01 2015 UTC,"So how do you feel about Ride the Drive, or farmers market, or crazy legs, or the marathon, or Shake The Lake, or the other events that close down the streets in that area?  I lived down there for a while, it sucked not being able to go anywhere on a Wednesday evening because concerts on the square and the traffic made it impossible to get out of my garage... Same with Saturday mornings.  I don't find the protest to be anything different than that, as far as impeding travel is concerned."

Honestly, how would you feel if a former President was referring to your parents as below and the oppression continued through the drug war which targeted you based upon socio-economic status and who could profit off of incarceration:   The diaries of H. R. Haldeman, President Richard M. Nixon's chief of staff until the Watergate scandal prompted Mr. Nixon to dismiss him, include references to Mr. Nixon's believing that there was ""total Jewish domination of the media"" and that ""the whole problem is really the blacks."""
madisonwi,35ucwn,mst3kcrow,9,Thu May 14 00:12:24 2015 UTC,"sorry but I'm not the one you have to convince..that message isn't what the majority of people stuck in traffic are inherently getting, is the point i'm trying to make"
madisonwi,35ucwn,BarkMingo,12,Thu May 14 00:29:34 2015 UTC,"For me it has nothing to do with agreeing or disagreeing with the cause. I live in the area. Two weeks ago my roommate had to take me to the ER due to a serious asthma attack. A month before that my pet had a medical emergency and had to be rushed to the vet. Point is, you can't assume that everyone is just popping over to the store for some milk. There are legitimate reasons that someone may actually need to get through that part of town. If I had had to sit there and watch my cat crying in pain and bleeding out in the front seat of my car because people felt compelled to sit in the street, I'm fairly sure I would have had a serious mental breakdown.   Edit: words"
madisonwi,35ucwn,Goodbubbles,4,Wed May 13 21:23:32 2015 UTC,"This is an entirely valid point, but also not the scenario for most people and protests are hardly the only thing in Madison that will severely inconvenience someone's commute or put someone's (or their pets) life in danger because of bad traffic.  Whenever there are big sporting events, or they shut down parts of the town to hold different races and events, or have the Halloween thing on State St the roads get really backed up as well.  And even though they will notify you ahead of time, it's still usually an absolute clusterfuck  Depending on where you live, if you need to take a downtown bus route anywhere during a Farmer's Market day or home football game day, be prepared to be extremely late, sometimes 1-2 hours late to your final destination.  On Halloween, if you need to take a bus anywhere near downtown past 9pm, you will need to start walking or find a ride because the buses will skip stops, stop running entirely, and taxis will refuse service because of traffic and being so busy.  So why do people get extremely outraged at protests, but not just as pissed off about the Badgers, Farmer's Market, or Halloween?  Because ultimately what they're actually pissed about is because it's a protest they don't agree with."
madisonwi,35ucwn,Mswindupbird89,2,Wed May 13 22:35:37 2015 UTC,"Well, I can only speak for myself, but I would definitely be equally pissed. I fully support peoples right to protest. It's essential that the publics voices are able to be heard, regardless of whether I agree with them or not. I just disagree with this particular aspect of it. The cause could be ""raising money for goodbubbles dying cat"" and I would still disagree with them shutting down the road. Just my personal opinion, obviously others disagree and that's fine."
madisonwi,35ucwn,Goodbubbles,3,Thu May 14 21:41:09 2015 UTC,"Is your cat OK now? While not wanting to distract too much from the issues the protesters are trying to bring attention to (or the other issues they're creating), having a pet emergency must be ridiculously hard. Hope they're doing better.  Here's hoping everyone stuck in traffic has a safe, albeit slow and perhaps aggravating, day."

madisonwi,35ucwn,Goodbubbles,7,Wed May 13 22:53:34 2015 UTC,"in theory...but I'm telling you I've seen and talked to a lot of people that are pissed off, simply because of the inconvenience, and where they would otherwise stay out of it, are now siding against the protestors  i'm not saying it's right but that it happens, and where i'm looking at it from, it just seems counterproductive as they seem to be creating as many opponents as supporters  are the protestors realizing this? or do they have the same attitude as you that assumes everyone sees the big picture? because not everyone does"
madisonwi,35ucwn,BarkMingo,7,Wed May 13 22:59:46 2015 UTC,"I will admit that I hate the protesters. Yes, hate. I don't even drive on John Nolen, but blocking such an integral means of transportation is selfish and makes me angry that they disturbed thousands of people who were trying to be productive today.  I think I keep those feelings separate from my thoughts about the actual issue at hand, but they certainly make it difficult for me. My thoughts go out to Tony's family and friends. But the hoard of black youth who are acting like the victims will get no sympathy from me."

I can safely say that a large chuck of folks would be far more inclined to support their cause were it simply focused in the right direction more often.
madisonwi,35ucwn,Rignite,2,Thu May 14 14:09:32 2015 UTC,The 'right direction' is debatable. Obviously people who don't face the same disparities won't share the same perspective.  I also think the path of the march was logical. It started at the site of the shooting and ended at the courthouse/jail. The organizers informed the city of their path and police rerouted traffic just like they would for any other event.

madisonwi,35ucwn,aertime,6,Wed May 13 19:59:15 2015 UTC,"They were being fairly aggressive at the march too. One news person was yelling at people to put down their signs that said ""FUCK THE POLICE"" since they couldn't air that on TV. They were aggressively putting their cameras in people's faces and in my opinion looking for a confrontation. I heard another camera man complaining about halfway through the march saying ""I didn't sign up for this shit"".  Thankfully, everyone remained peaceful and the news didn't get what they wanted."

madisonwi,35ucwn,madman86,3,Thu May 14 21:32:59 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Peaceful doesn't get news media attention. Why do people think riots and looting happen?

madisonwi,35yr2y,omniraden,8,Thu May 14 21:07:03 2015 UTC,That will never happen. Ever. Why don't they make some reasonable demands so they don't look like a laughing stock?
madisonwi,35yr2y,teethteetheat,10,Thu May 14 18:55:37 2015 UTC,"First it was fire all police, now it's ""let us fire all police.""  Who knows, maybe a few years from now they'll make a realistic demand."
madisonwi,35yr2y,IDreamOfRedditing,2,Thu May 14 17:51:53 2015 UTC,"A while ago, someone explained it in a way that made a lot of sense to me.  You have a more extreme group that demands things that are very unlikely to happen.  You also have a more moderate groups pushing for more incremental change.  Because of all of the noise made by the more extreme group, city leaders decide to do something and adopt some of the positive changes pushed for by the moderate group.  So even though none of the extreme groups demands are met directly, they are furthering the cause by raising discussion about the issue.  So YGBC might never need to make a realistic demand to achieve change.  I am not familiar enough with the situation to know the more moderate groups or the changes that they might suggest.  Or maybe YGBC is just crazy in a pointless way.  That's a decision you'll have to make for yourself."
madisonwi,35yr2y,dahakon,5,Thu May 14 19:43:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, the inside/outside strategy is one that works. The problem comes when the more extreme group acts in a way that primes the target audience against the proposals of the more moderate group (in YGB's case comparing Madison to Ferguson, making ridiculous demands, etc.)"
madisonwi,35yr2y,IDreamOfRedditing,2,Thu May 14 20:03:25 2015 UTC,"Michael Johnson probably has a political career after this if he wants one. (I don't know if he wants one.) He's come off as an effective leader and community organizer, capable of working with all sides and for pushing for more moderate change. His reaction to the shootings and continued involvement in activism has definitely raised his profile over the past few months, and as far as I can tell he's been almost universally well-received.  I think it's likely that the protests will lead to cautious, moderate change, but YGB's continued involvement will be minimal. It's almost certainly going to be older, more entrenched black activists leading the charge to implement actual change--people who are willing to work within the system rather than trying to overthrow it. I'm just not sure who they're going to be. Aside from Michael Johnson--did the Urban League thing hurt Kaleem Caire too much? What's Noble Wray planning on doing with his post-police life? Is Wayne Strong still interested in politics? Alex Gee?"

Tony was tweaking, sounds like he was potentially assaulting some of his friends, or at least scaring them, so they left him.

madisonwi,35r0rc,Buckys_Butt_Buddy,15,Tue May 12 21:05:21 2015 UTC,"Personally, I agree with your first statement. Based on the DA's comments it sounds like they originally locked him in the apartment then let him out at some point. If they had kept him in there until the police arrived, then they could have informed them that there was no one else in the apartment so there was no need for the officer to rush in and they could have waited for back up.   That being said when you're in that situation you're not thinking clearly and make irrational choices. Either way it's a tragic situation"

""All seven shots hit Tony Robinson Jr. at close range,"" Ozanne said. ""...All bullets hit Robinson from front to back.""   That seals it for me right there. Tony wasn't killed because he was black. He was killed because he continued to pursue an officer he had successfully struck.  I have no doubt in my mind that had he backed off after the punch to the officers head and gone back in that apt, that he would most likely be alive right now."
madisonwi,35r0rc,sordfysh,-3,Thu May 14 05:25:53 2015 UTC,"In my line of work, when we see a problem, instead of asking how to fix the immediate problem, we step back and ask whether the problem started earlier.  Why do cops approach an aggressive person alone? Do they think that they can subdue a drugged out person by themselves?  Think: if there were two cops, they could likely handle a single person, especially since one would have a taser. Does this city train their cops to enter a dangerous situation alone? As a layman, that sounds like a decision that would either result in a dead criminal or dead cop. I'm asking curiously because I want to know how we as a society can prevent this in the future.  Did the roommates not talk to the cop? Did they not try to help the cop subdue their friend/family member? That seems to be foolish, too, though they are essentially kids.  Honestly, there seems to be a lot of blame to go around. The kid should not have taken so many shrooms. His friends/brothers should have tried to work with the cop. The cop should have requested backup before Leeroy-Jenkins-ing into the building.  The kid is dead, so he got the raw end of the situation, the kids lost their older brother which hopefully they can learn to work with cops better, and the cop- the person who was in charge of the situation- gets off without additional training.  As well as Madison handled the situation, why can't they force the cop to undergo retraining? It would say to the community, ""our job is to subdue, so in that respect we failed. However the situation was dangerous, and the cop protected himself, so in that respect we are happy to see that more lives weren't lost."""
madisonwi,35r0rc,AsianThunder,26,Thu May 14 19:34:30 2015 UTC,"In this particular case, the officer approached Robinson alone because he thought that there was a struggle between him and another person in the upstairs apartment where that person's life was in danger. Robinson was making noises indicative of a struggle (punching the walls, etc.), and the initial 911 call was from a friend of his who had implied there were other people with Robinson in the apartment at the time, so this wasn't necessarily an unreasonable assumption to make. In general, officers are trained to respond to aggressive people only when they have backup. The exception is--as it was in this case--when they suspect that the aggressive person might cause harm to a bystander in the time that it takes for backup to arrive.  The roommates didn't talk to the officer--they had disappeared by the time the cops arrived. I suspect that they were--at least-- smoking pot at the time and were concerned about the fallout if they were caught, so they scattered. Dumb, but most kids I know would've made the same decision at their age.   A lot of the things about this case are extra-heartbreaking just because in retrospect they seem so easily avoidable. There really was a perfect storm of things that needed to happen for this to end in death."
madisonwi,35r0rc,sordfysh,0,Thu May 14 02:41:38 2015 UTC,"The witness testimonies were pretty heartbreaking. One witness saw the kids plead with the cop after he emerged from the building. They were in shock that their family member was just shot by the cop they asked to help resolve the struggle.  It's not fair to cast blame, but I can't help imagine myself smoking or trying shrooms with my brother. I can also remember a time when I tried what I thought was weed, but it was really cannabanoids that induce violent paranoia in some people. Turns out that I'm affected, so thankfully I didn't smoke very much before realizing that my heart rate was flying and I was accusing my friends of poisoning me. I remember wanting to flip their table just to show how angry I was that I believed that they poisoned me. I'm just super glad that they stayed calm and calmed me down instead of bringing a cop in. For all I know, my anxiety could have convinced me that the cop was just there to put a bullet in my head. My guess is that something like that happened to kid that was shot. He was taking Xanax without a prescription, so it could have been the mixture of the withdrawal from that that elevated his anxiety."
madisonwi,35r0rc,Rignite,5,Tue May 12 22:08:40 2015 UTC,"Just want to point out that traditional marijuana has cannabinoids that many feel induce paranoia. If paranoia is the only reason you think it was something other than weed, thought you might be curious to know."
madisonwi,35r0rc,juice369,2,Wed May 13 00:14:01 2015 UTC,"Nope. I've been paranoid on regular weed, but my heart rate doesn't escalate like it did with this fake weed stuff. My heart rate jumped as if I was in the middle of a cardio workout. When that happens, your brain tries to find a reason to expel energy, which paired with paranoia may present as violence or aggression."
madisonwi,35r0rc,sshastings114,2,Wed May 13 04:39:13 2015 UTC,Tachycardia is a side effect. Could've been a strain you weren't used to. All weed is not created equal.
madisonwi,35r0rc,crzygoalkeeper92,2,Wed May 13 05:14:25 2015 UTC,"You may be right, but I was told at the beginning that it was synthetic weed, but ""pretty much the same thing"". And ""not dangerous like K2"". Legal to buy in certain hookah shops, though. Then again, it was a little over 4 years ago, and the event was pretty intense, since I literally believed that I was going to die. The next worst experience with weed was where I got trapped in my thoughts. No thoughts of death at all."
madisonwi,35r0rc,wolfbriar,11,Wed May 13 08:20:49 2015 UTC,"He scared his friends away with violence. His own friends were scared off by the violent unpredictable behavior shown that night. That speaks volumes of just how off the reservation he was that night.  If you're going to do this ""root of the problem"" sort of logic, then we can go further back than that. It's a slippery slope of unnecessary excuses.  Also, you assume there will be no additional training. That is an outright assumption that is only stated as to show better to the angle you're very obviously playing. What re-training should he undergo? He acted as he should in the situation. The verdict was saying precisely that.  Please. What are you trying at?"
madisonwi,35r0rc,omniraden,8,Wed May 13 16:26:44 2015 UTC,"I think he simply missed the fact that the officer believed people were in danger when he decided to ""Leeroy-Jenkins."" Ozanne mentioned something to the effect of fists hitting walls, items being thrown about, and incoherent yelling.  99% of cops don't wake up and say ""I hope I get to fire my weapon and be a hero today."" Officer Kenny doesn't need retraining; he acted in accordance with his training. Sad to say, but had he lost the fight with Robinson, more people could have been in life-threatening danger. When you attack someone who is carrying a firearm, you're only a small struggle away from being armed yourself."
madisonwi,35r0rc,likeahorse15,2,Wed May 13 16:37:05 2015 UTC,You are missing the fact that the cop went in because it sounded like there was a fight. Its the main reason he didn't wait for backup.

For situations like this, where people have been described to be unhinged/wigging out, wouldn't a non-lethal take down be protocol?   They said multiple times the guy wasn't armed.   If it isn't protocol... do you think it should be?  Honestly unless the perp has a weapon and is endangering the LIVES of other people (not just randomly running around punching people), I don't feel lethal force is the best option.  Thoughts?"
madisonwi,35r0rc,MagicAvenger,22,Wed May 13 00:43:21 2015 UTC,"Here's an article on the subject:   [I]n cases where a subject is believed to be armed with a dangerous weapon, an officer may not arm him or herself with an ECD unless another officer at the scene has the immediate ability to deliver deadly force."
madisonwi,35r0rc,charlestonchewing,29,Wed May 13 12:50:44 2015 UTC,"The problem is that you only get 1 shot with a taser. If you miss, or one of the probes doesn't connect, or it has no effect, you are left standing there within close proximity to the subject who can then lunge at you and fight before you have time to draw another weapon. That's why it's recommended that you have a cover officer when using a taser."

For situations like this, where people have been described to be unhinged/wigging out, wouldn't a non-lethal take down be protocol? They said multiple times the guy wasn't armed.   The DA said that the officer had been punched in the head while in the stairway hard enough for his head to leave a dent or hole in the drywall.  Cop was afraid he would lose consciousness if hit again.   If it isn't protocol... do you think it should be? Honestly unless the perp has a weapon and is endangering the LIVES of other people (not just randomly running around punching people), I don't feel lethal force is the best option. Thoughts?   Lethal force was justified because the officer was being punched in the head."
madisonwi,35r0rc,ScottWalkerSucks,7,Thu May 14 02:07:13 2015 UTC,"Tasers can be very useful in certain situations, but in a case where you're approaching an aggressive suspect alone, I would be shocked if it wasn't departmental protocol to respond with a gun drawn. Which obviously limits your options in regards to non-lethal take-downs, because if somebody does attack you, you aren't going to have time to switch to your taser mid-struggle. (Also, I don't know about the Madison police specifically, but in many jurisdictions tasers are worn on the back of the police belt, which means that if you're knocked onto your back or side, you're likely going to have a hard time getting to it.)  Which kind of gets to the heart of this case . . . I think it's pretty clear from the recounting of the shooting that the officer followed protocol. We can't charge him, because he didn't do anything he wasn't supposed to do. But the more important questions have to do with whether or not the current departmental protocol is really the best way to handle things."
madisonwi,35r0rc,vatoniolo,7,Thu May 14 09:14:09 2015 UTC,"Regarding TASERs, from the Stanford Criminal Justice Center (PDF), the short answer is they're probably about as dangerous as they can be when used in a situation like the Tony Robinson case.   When practicable, avoid prolonged or continuous exposure(s) to the TASER device electrical discharge. The stress and exertion of extensive repeated, prolonged, or continuous application(s) of the TASER device may contribute to cumulative exhaustion, stress, and associated medical risk(s). Severe exhaustion and/or over-exertion from physical struggle, drug intoxication, use of restraint devices, etc. may result in serious injury or death."

madisonwi,35r0rc,MrTubes,2,Tue May 12 21:05:39 2015 UTC,"Regarding #3 - No, but perhaps protocol will be to wait for back up in similar situations in the future. A perp doesn't need a weapon to do serious damage or kill someone. They can incapacitate or forcibly take the officers weapon, or arm themselves during the engagement. The fact was he was attacking a police officer in close quarters. The officer drew his weapon, told him to stop, and he continued to advance. At that point the officer has to make a split second decision: will this guy stop or will he kill me or others if I do not stop him? That is an extremely hard call to make in such a short amount of time. It is tragic that this happened, but put in the same situation, I would guess 99/100 people would have done the same thing."

As I sit here thinking about what is going to be said this afternoon.. and try to prepare for a very painful outcome.. I sit here and I look at what has taken place since March 6th 2015.  The night my son was massacred in the stairwell of his OWN HOME.. almost immediately following his death.. before I could even bury my 1st born son.. the smear campaign began.. the threats started rolling in. As I tried to grieve my son, protect my family, hold on to my other children... the city I live in began to slowly, piece by piece, destroy what little we had left.  A few weeks after my son was killed the media and police department released records to the public.. that they knew full well were not my son.. trying to make my baby out to be a criminal.. thus making ppl believe that he deserved to die.  When we were able to shut those records down and show that they were not my sons.. they then turned around and began to try to make him seem suicidal. They released a news article regarding a 911 call I made regarding an argument him and I had. When that didn't do enough damage...  a week later they released the audio tape of that 911 call and decided it would be just fine to leave my address and phone number..thus taking our home and all sense of security away from my children and I. In the time since.. we have been reduced to living in hotels.  And still I had not been violent.. I did not lash out.. as they kept making mention of violence from us or our supporters.  The ppl of this city have been cruel.. hateful.. evil.. even threatening toward me and my family... and still we stood in peace. They wanted to break us.  The DA gave himself a 3 week time line.. which ended a week and a half ago.. I sat and thought to myself ""no... he wouldn't be so cruel"".. mothers day came... I had gotten home from DC at only 12:30 that day.. as I was opening gifts from my babies.. trying to keep a smile on my face for them.. I received the call. The DA was giving me 48 hr notice of announcement. He did it on mothers day. Taking from me any chance at some form if peace that day. Destroying my chance to just sit and love my remaining living babies.  And now... we come to today. Today this man will sit in my face and try and explain to me why he has decided to let the man that has murdered my son.. get away with murder for the 2nd time.  See I lost hope a long time ago... any city who treats a grieving mother with the amount of disrespect they have done to me... will obviously set the animal that takes lives free to murder again.  They have set the stage.. and today the play will commence. They have already told us what the decision is... u only need to have been paying  attention.  We can hope for a miracle.. but we know the truth.  My pain is inconceivable.."""

Whether or not had been arrested previously is moot.  Thousands of people hear of an arrest and well... we all have ""those"" friends on facebook who have something extremely ignorant to say about the situation.  Does a young person making a mistake mean they deserves to die?  Of course not, and a mother shouldn't have to hear thousands of ignorant people telling her otherwise.  She also shouldn't have her personal information divulged.  It's absolutely disgusting the way some people handled this situation.  However, it was not the Madison police who did this, just a bunch of sick motherfuckers with far too much time on their hands.  That being said, I agree with the verdict.  Nobody can expect the mother to think that her own son was at fault in this situation.  Let her grieve, let her express herself, even if you don't agree with parts of it."

Andrea Irwin's failing as a mother is more responsible for Tony Robinson's death than Officer Kenny. Yeah. I said it. She raised him and failed him.

People are talking about this shooting as a tragedy. Yeah, it's sad, but a tragedy is usually something totally unexpected, like an earthquake or a fire. When a 19 year old already has a rap sheet and a baby, when young man chooses to spend his time with drugs and thugs, getting shot is not really a surprising result. Yet any time this context is brought up, accusations fly about racism, people yell ""Oh so you think he deserved to die!"" NO. What we're saying is, a man who accidentally falls into a piranha tank is a victim, but a man who willingly swims in a piranha-infested river should not be surprised when he's bitten."

I think Tony Robinson's race is completely irrelevant to this entire issue. Kenny didn't shoot him because he was black. He shot him because Robinson attacked him. Being black has nothing to do with it.   The real problem is poverty and mental illness and poor parenting. No one in the YGB coalition is talking about those issues (especially not the last two). They're racists, plain and simple. None of those people gave two shits about Tony Robinson when he was alive, and I contend they don't care about him now either. They're whoring out his dead body for political purposes, and that's disgusting. This poor kid never had a chance."

Short of having on hand a a syringe, sedative and knowing how to use it, asking for help in dealing with a drug overdose or bad reaction is the right thing to do.   Maybe they could or should have stressed more on the phone with 911 (presumably 911 and not the police) the medical nature of the emergency, but that still doesn't mean the police wouldn't have shown up before the ambulance or firefighters because there was a call in already about his behavior in public."

It's meant for the people who do now or might in the future use drugs, and for the people around them.]  Drugs.  I'll say it again because it's getting lost against the (very relevant, obviously) background of race relations and police practices in the USA: DRUGS!   For those of you who don't know: eating psiloc(yb)in mushrooms almost always reults in a very particular response curve, barring rare deficiency in certain enzymes or mixing with certain of exotic drugs, or a prolonging of onset due to having a full stomach. Ca. 30 minutes after ingestion one starts to feel light-headed, possibly euphoric, likely energized. After ca. 45 minutes, things start to get heavy, and the giggles are likely to set in. Deep introspection is to be expected. After ca. 60-90 minutes one starts to ""peak"": things get really weird, one's atavistic everything starts leaking everywhere, everything is covered in paisley, produndity (or ""profundity""), truth (or ""truth"") and possibly everything one has ever repressed, felt, or imagined (and more!) might just form the fabric of one's being and world. This is the mytho-poetic phase in which one might battle dragons, discover that the name of the devil happens to also be the name of a certain ninth grade math teacher, talk to one's dead or absent father (""really"" as to an hallucination, or symbolically as to a memory -- it doesn't matter! The name, the sound of the name, and the named can all become real).   Uusally peaking lasts 30-60 minutes. Then comes an hour or two of coming back to reality, then an hour or two of being pretty stinking high but still fairly well grounded in the everyday here-and-now. (As opposed to the ecstatic here-and-now, but I digress)  This sounds like fun to a lot of people. And it is! Or can be. It also has a power that a person might not be able to appreciate without being ""experienced"", or touched by God or falling in love or shipping off to war or going absolutely mad or what have you. In particular, a bad trip can make the monsters under your bed come alive, and no amount of turning on the light and calling for mother and father will banish them. It can make you ""realize"" that all of your friends hate you and are plotting to banish your soul to the ninth layer of hell, and that there is a devil inside of you promising an eternity of torture. It can -- more topically -- make you feel with your every mortal fiber and faculty all of the anger, violence, frustration, aggression, denigration etc ad infernum that you have ever received, dealt, seen or imagined, and leave you either a weeping mess or a raging avatar. [My use of ""it"" and ""you"" here are a little bit inappropriate and rather wide of the mark, because in the experience one is part of the experience and vice versa.]  At least, until later. Once the peak is over, perspective comes back and the emotions and certitudes of before wane in their strength. The bad trip might be scarring, but it might also be cathartic, therapeutic. Or both.  There are some reasons why there is so much woo to hippy woo. One very salient reason has to do with all of the drugs: when you eat enough psychedelics you almost guarrantee that you will eventually have a Very Bad Time, or at best a Unpleasant Learning Experience, and the techniques learned in meditation and practice of some religions or quasi-religious practices are very relevant to not losing your shit in such a way that you become a danger to yourself and others.   You know the admonishment to only trip with an experienced sitter? Experienced doesn't just (or even necessarily) mean ""has eaten lots and lots drugs, party on dude"", it means the sitter can provide a center of calm in the storm, can effect and direct transference and rapport, can talk a person down off the ledge, can know when to butt in and know when to shut up. Sadly, much of the hard-won knowledge the West learned in the sixties and seventies is completely ignored today, even if indigenous people around the world have known similar things since forever.  Unfortunately, I don't trust that our police are willing and able to deal with a crazy and/or shrooming (""tweaking"", here meaning that drugs seem to be in control I guess) person in a way that will de-escalate and keep everyone safe  Please practice using your mantras or other objects of focus, practice mindfulness meditation, read up on your Tibetan Buddhist stories, take a pilgrimage to Oaxaca or the Amazon, whatever, just please understand that mushrooms aren't a harmless toy.  My two cents: had Tony been left alone for between 30 minutes and 4 hours, he'd have ended the day alive, if maybe a little bit ashamed at his uncontrolled behavior. Unless he'd managed to get into the apartment and to the ""samurai sword"" and decided to go using it. Even a cheap prop can be a dangerous thing :|"

No kidding."
madisonwi,35r0rc,name_with_a_y,7,Wed May 13 22:17:15 2015 UTC,"Yup. I knew a guy who had a xanax problem. Go over to his place, he'd go upstairs ""just a minute"" and a half hour later I'd go upstairs and he'd've totally forgotten I was at his place.  Made him look like the village drunk.. Stupid, unpredictable, and surprisingly coordinated considering every step looks like he's gonna go face first into a wall or TV screen.  Never seen anything like it except maybe excess alcohol. Except more drowsy. That's the other bit. I was always worried he'd full asleep in the middle of what passed for a conversation with him while he was xanaxed out.  Kids, this is a PSA: xanax is a helluva drug."
madisonwi,35r0rc,appreciate_it,8,Wed May 13 01:57:38 2015 UTC,"So maybe I'm missing something, but if the officer was worried about being knocked down a flight of stairs and losing control of his service weapon, why were all shots fired from the bottom of the stairs?"
madisonwi,35r0rc,TrynnaFindaBalance,74,Wed May 13 03:37:10 2015 UTC,"The victim closed fist punched the officer in the face after the officer announced himself as Madison Police from the stairwell, knocking the officer into the wall and down the stairs.   At that point, the officer became concerned he could lose his service weapon and it would be used against the other people in the apartment or himself."
madisonwi,35r0rc,aertime,18,Wed May 13 04:03:24 2015 UTC,You're being downvoted for some reason but that's exactly what the DA said.
madisonwi,35r0rc,appreciate_it,3,Wed May 13 04:10:05 2015 UTC,"What I don't understand is if he was knocked down the stairs, how was he in danger of losing his weapon once it was drawn and he established a distance between himself and the deceased?"
madisonwi,35r0rc,eragondaparagon,19,Wed May 13 09:28:17 2015 UTC,"He was struck in the head and knocked into the wall. His worry was that, if struck again in a similar matter, he could be knocked unconscious and fall down the stairs, or be knocked off balance and hit his head on the way down, either scenario resulting in the loss of his service weapon, which would put others in danger.   He ended up at the bottom of the stairs, likely backing down after initially being hit, and the aggressor was coming down the stairs toward him, he opened fire up the stairs."
madisonwi,35r0rc,environmentalent,15,Tue May 12 20:23:56 2015 UTC,"After the initial punch, Robinson continued to lunge towards the officer. By the time he reacted, I'm sure that distance was closing quickly."
madisonwi,35r0rc,wolfbriar,20,Tue May 12 20:28:05 2015 UTC,"This is not meant to be snarky, but I'm sure someone in the investigation asked this question based on the amount of scrutiny everyone knew it would get."
madisonwi,35r0rc,pianoplaya316,3,Tue May 12 20:36:50 2015 UTC,"He hadn't established distance. The DA said that after Kenney fired his last shot, you could see Robinson's feet in the doorway on the squad video."
madisonwi,35r0rc,wolfbriar,11,Tue May 12 20:35:19 2015 UTC,"He was hit, knocked to the side and backwards, got his handgun up and opened fire. This all happened so fast that he didn't realize he was on the ground floor. He was probably only a few steps up when first hit.   Basically, if you ever get hit, you kind of freeze and don't think for a few seconds. I think he opened fire in that time and only composed himself after."
madisonwi,35r0rc,pianoplaya316,-2,Tue May 12 20:45:50 2015 UTC,"But wasn't the officer at the top of the stairs when he got punched?  One of the twitter feeds following the press conference said the patrol car's dash cam saw the officer backing out of the side door, then firing a shot.  So he got punched, then backed down the stairs, then fired 7 shots?  Sorry if I'm missing something, I've only been following the twitter feeds and haven't seen the full conference yet."
madisonwi,35r0rc,wolfbriar,8,Tue May 12 20:46:54 2015 UTC,I think he was on the stairway when the attack started. That's what I got from the press conference.
madisonwi,35r0rc,Dysnomi,0,Tue May 12 20:39:26 2015 UTC,"What I read was that the deceased ""came around a corner"" and punched the officer in the face, which made me believe he was at the top of the steps.  Perhaps I'm wrong."
madisonwi,35r0rc,wolfbriar,14,Tue May 12 23:20:14 2015 UTC,"The DA says in the press release that the staircase had 12 steps, and that the officer was on approximately the 8th step when he was attacked. So not a huge distance.  I imagine he gets attacked, falls down to the bottom of the steps, sees Tony pursuing and fires while taking the last few steps out the door (which is why he is stumbling as he backs up)."
madisonwi,35r0rc,Dysnomi,9,Tue May 12 20:26:10 2015 UTC,"Just to add to that, it's completely feasible that he was punched in the face while standing a few steps down. In fact, it would be easier to punch someone in the face if they were standing at a lower level."
madisonwi,35r0rc,wolfbriar,2,Tue May 12 20:28:19 2015 UTC,The thing I don't get is how was he so tweaked out on things that make you wanna melt into a couch and fall asleep.

Most people are fine, but some individuals can have extreme anxiety attacks and unpredictable behavior.    Also, he may have had a reaction to some other chemical that didn't show up in toxicology reports.  For example, it's not possible to drug test for a lot of the new bath salts drugs. It's a sad situation, and since he's dead we won't ever know why exactly he reacted that way."

madisonwi,35r0rc,Greenjourney,-1,Tue May 12 22:04:03 2015 UTC,"I'm unsurprised by the decision and the lack of reaction by the Madison community that thinks they're so far removed from race-related problems, but I'm also acutely disappointed that anyone in here thinks this was necessary, let alone justified. My ire is directed at the media for irresponsible reporting methods, the Madison Police Department for being no less militarized than the national average, and — most importantly — a legal and political structure that encourages just in case there's a weapon/they might get my weapon lethal force. Robinson should have taken a few well-deserved lumps with a baton for striking an officer, but a death sentence should've never entered the realm of possibility."
madisonwi,35r0rc,turpidyripkick,24,Tue May 12 22:43:46 2015 UTC,"Your comment comes from the appropriately disgusted perspective that Madison, as a community, does not fully understand or appreciate just how vast the racial disparities truly are not just in Madison, but in the nation and world. I get that. I totally agree with you. Not only do I say your anger is justified, but I'm right there with you.  But not in the case of this shooting.   Your statements about the actual shooting? Saying things like ""Death sentence,"" ""lumps with a baton,"" and ""they might get my weapon lethal force,"" makes it difficult for me to take seriously any perspective you have in regards to law enforcement. If you have not already seen it, the DA gave a very easy to follow and succinct summary of the events that night and why there is no charge. I suggest you watch the whole thing."
madisonwi,35r0rc,cakky1,5,Tue May 12 23:19:45 2015 UTC,"What is it that you find difficult to take seriously?    ""He indicated he was worried he would be struck again and lose consciousness,"" and was afraid his gun would be taken from him, Ozanne said   If that's not what ""they might get my weapon lethal force"" means then I don't know what it is.   Right now that seems to be the justification the DA gave for the officer's actions, and OP is saying that justification isn't good enough (and I agree)."
madisonwi,35r0rc,Dysnomi,22,Wed May 13 07:15:32 2015 UTC,"Alright, I'll bite. I can only tackle a few points though. Forgive me, its getting late.   The commentary given and word choice used by OP implies to me a unhealthy naivety that comes from a lack of training and poor empathy for law enforcement / emergency personnel whom are forced into these situations.  I'm making some assumptions, I'll admit. Sorry for that. But lets look at why I find these perspectives difficult to take seriously.  ""Take a few lumps from a baton.""   I could stop at Rodney King, but that is a different case and different situation. This situation did not allow for a baton. He was alone. He may have had to fight in a very tight space. There may have been a victim in the room with Robinson. Robinson could have easily acquired a weapon after entering the house. With the given information and lack of information, Kenny had entered a very dangerous situation and not taking the threat seriously would have put everyone on that block in serious risk. Police are trained to have guns drawn when clearing rooms in this situation for good reason and not having backup greatly limits his ability to take advantage of less lethal tactics like the baton.   ""Death Sentence.""  Kenny is not Judge Dredd and calling what happened a death sentence is being dramatic or the effects of skipping off the facts of this 23 second event like a rock off a pond. For starts, Kenny had been punched in the head which never makes it easy to assess your situation. He had been thrown into a wall and was attempting to shout commands at someone who was not responding to commands. He had to back up through a landing/stairway/entry way he had only entered once while dazed from being struck by a violent potentially homicidal man under the influence of drugs. He had no backup he could rely on at the time. Taking more blows to the head could easily result in Kenny's death, the death of anyone still in the building that had not yet been cleared, and anyone in the area. About 23 seconds. In the whirling chaos of unknown factors, a daze from being struck, and a charging fully grown 6'4"" drug crazed adult, he does not have the luxury to say, ""I better not shoot because he is black,"" or ""He is just a troubled youth and with counseling I'm sure this will all end well,"" or ""Maybe I'll risk fighting him with my baton,"" or ""maybe I'll drop the gun, pull out my taser."" He had one correct option in this situation and he took it.   ""Race related...problem that was not necessary/justified.""  I will again agree with you to a degree. You could make a good argument that race had been a large factor that put Tony Robinson in the position that he was in. Anyone who says that what happened was anything less than tragic has a disgusting and callus heart. All lives matter and we all collectively loose some brightness at the loss of life, for whomever the bell tolls.   But. Change nothing but skin color that night in any combination you want and the outcome would have been the same.   I could probably have saved us all a little time by agreeing that we have a problem with militarization of police, profiling, incarcerating our minority citizens, a failed drug war, widening socio-economic gaps, failing educational systems, corrupt government, segregation, racism within communities and organizations, ect ect ect. But reducing the decision on whether to charge Kenny to a ""win-loss,"" situation for social justice is not justice. Kenny should not be a scapegoat for racism and social inequality. All that matters when deciding whether to charge Kenny are the facts. To make assumptions on his guilt for any other reason is not a drive for justice, but vengeance.  After hearing the DA's press conference, I would say that his actions were justified."

Police are trained to have guns drawn when clearing rooms in this situation for good reason and not having backup greatly limits his ability to take advantage of less lethal tactics like the baton.   I think this is what needs to be talked about here. This is your opinion. It's the opinion of the MPD and the DA. It is not an opinion I agree with. We should seriously consider the premise of police entering situations assuming they will need to use their firearms. Further we should seriously consider if entering this situation with only one officer was correct, given the dispatch operator's information. Those are two pretty obvious ways that MPD could have changed its ways.   I think at a deeper level we need to ask ourselves what should be the role of police in our society. Is their role to ""neutralize the threat"" (as we hear so often) quickly as possible? Or do they need to value the lives of the perceived criminals more highly? (Note how this is probably a question we can also ask of our military)   I also think you're misrepresenting OP when it comes to the race related issue. (S)he wasn't necessarily saying that Kenny exhibited racial tendencies. In fact I don't think anyone has said that. But, we shouldn't ignore the fact that situations like these disproportionately affect racial minorities.   Edit: I suppose I should also mention that if the reasoning behind officers entering potentially dangerous scenarios with guns drawn is to preemptively prepare for a weapons threat,  then entering as a single person with no backup is pretty irresponsible if not downright dangerous."
madisonwi,35r0rc,Dysnomi,8,Wed May 13 00:15:38 2015 UTC,"Your first paragraph: Entering a situation in which a firearm is required is easy to make in post production hindsight. I would not agree that our police should be willfully making themselves more vulnerable during these situation. As far as backup is concerned, he did not know if Robinson was actively attacking someone. Had that been the case, then a victim could have died while he was waiting for backup (again this took 23 seconds).   Second paragraph: Good questions. Totally agree.  Third: OP calls the problem race related in the first sentence. I don't know what ""exhibiting racial tendencies,"" is (I'll assume racist), but Kenny has been unfairly under fire for this from the very beginning as has Madison Police Department.  Your edit: DA covered all of this in the press conference. You should watch it."

Then why are you still defending a state institution that wields deadly force apparently without any repercussions?  Justify Kenny's actions all you will, it doesn't excuse policing protocols that promote the use of deadly force or a justice system that villainizes victimless crimes.  If I were in Kenny's shoes, I'd have probably made his same mistakes. Let's focus on this and work to change the system to avoid these situations in the future:  Drug reform that values human lives.  Police reform that values human lives.  P.S. fuck the media for their ""covering"" this incident without painting the bigger picture."

To make assumptions on his guilt for any other reason is not a drive for justice, but vengeance. After hearing the DA's press conference, I would say that his actions were justified.  OP has set up, from a beginning, a critique on the big picture and my apologies if we have gotten off topic. I'm not qualified or willing to defend ""the institution,"" but I will defend the individual who acted as best he could with the information he had against people who are calling for vengeance."
madisonwi,35r0rc,tasunder,5,Wed May 13 03:26:43 2015 UTC,When did I ever symay I want Kenny charged? I don't want more victims! I want less victims!   I want people to consider that the drug war is the problem here. Not race. We need to decriminalize and educate people how to use drugs appropriately.  If I blame anyone it's Tony's friends for calling the police on their hulking tripping friend. But I can easily shift that blame to a community that resists smart drug policy.

madisonwi,35qfmf,krncnr,7,Tue May 12 17:41:02 2015 UTC,"I have to admit (though, truly, I doubt I've ever talked aobut it) that I agree that circumcision is cruel and is mutilation.  They give the baby no anesthetic. source: I insisted that I stay with my infant son while he was circumcised. I basically had put no thought into agreeing to it - - hospital staff sorta said ""Now he gets circumcised"".  And I let them do it.  He had lots of pain.  I stood there and wept.  A rather vivid memory."
madisonwi,35qfmf,NirvanaNow,3,Tue May 12 17:55:02 2015 UTC,"They give the baby no anesthetic.   I thought not giving babies anesthetic was based on old thought in medicine that ""babies can't feel pain."" Is this still the case?  edit: I know babies can feel pain, they're geniuses, but I meant do doctors still use that idea for skipping anesthesia."
madisonwi,35qfmf,lucentcb,2,Tue May 12 18:33:25 2015 UTC,"I've seen conflicting stories. Some claim that doctors are using the ""babies can't feel pain"" story and say they just ignore the baby's screaming. Other people have said they basically use a clip to cut off circulation and feeling to the area, and say their baby didn't even seem to notice.  It seems to vary by hospital."
madisonwi,35qfmf,spartandudehsld,3,Tue May 12 19:29:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but that doesn't match up to reality. The foreskin is attached to the glans at birth. To get the clip all the way up there they have to rip the skin away from the glans.   No pain? Bull Fucking Shit. At least we don't make permanent memories at that age."
madisonwi,35qfmf,menuka,4,Tue May 12 19:51:02 2015 UTC,Babies can feel pain. They obviously won't remember this though
madisonwi,35qfmf,sellyberry,1 point,Tue May 12 22:04:48 2015 UTC,Babies most certainly can feel pain!

madisonwi,35qfmf,readinginbed,4,Tue May 12 20:57:44 2015 UTC,"I agree that this practice is backwards, shameful violence. I also think it's unfortunate that the protests come with a lot of baggage associated with the Men's Rights Activism movement-- their other talking points are absolute misogynist garbage.  I know the world isn't a zero-sum game, but there's a lot of awareness of this in the United States right now. I'd like to see a fraction of the attention on female genital mutilation, which differs in a number of important ways: the procedure is done during pubescence, affects the most sensitive part of the female body (more akin to cutting the penis than the foreskin on men), and causes women to die, inhibits their ability to experience sexual pleasure, and experience horrible complications during childbirth.  http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/"
madisonwi,35qfmf,latticusnon,2,Wed May 13 16:40:35 2015 UTC,"FGM also ins't a huge problem in the States, being that it is illegal. It's a completely different issue. Circumcision is bad because it's done for no reason by people who never thought about why it was being done (except the doctors who get extra $$ for the procedure.) FGM is bad because it's done on purpose by people who know exactly what they are doing.  Complaining about FGM on the internet or in the streets won't accomplish anything. Complaining about circumcision makes people think about why they are doing it to their children, and might make some people choose to not do it."
madisonwi,35qfmf,readinginbed,2,Thu May 14 13:25:24 2015 UTC,"I understand that FGM isn't prevalent in the United States-- I'm suggesting that we expand our lens to encompass human rights issues worldwide. ""Complaining"" on the internet, fortunately, can accomplish a lot. Awareness is key, and many people are unaware. As I said above, this isn't a zero-sum game."
madisonwi,35qfmf,readinginbed,2,Thu May 14 14:55:48 2015 UTC,"Also, I agree that it's a completely different issue-- but many groups against male circumcision falsely conflate the two. Again, the pain and risk associated with FGM is more akin to cutting the penis than the foreskin."
madisonwi,35qfmf,omniraden,11,Thu May 14 14:57:19 2015 UTC,"Agreed, don't mutilate the genitals of children.  If they want to when they are adults, good for them."
madisonwi,35qfmf,Exayex,-12,Tue May 12 17:48:18 2015 UTC,"Not really how it works. It's best to do it when newly born so there isn't a bad memory. Same with cropping a puppy's tail. Some call it mutilation.  But it's actually necessary for muscular short-haired dogs like boxers. So they do it while they're puppies since they heal faster, won't remember it and don't have to adjust to a massive change later in life.   I'm glad I got it done. Women are massively turned off by uncircumcised penises.  Kids who were uncircumcised in school were mocked.   They sound gross, dirty and harder to maintain."
madisonwi,35qfmf,omniraden,13,Tue May 12 20:57:59 2015 UTC,"Remember what we are talking about is the compulsory mutilation of the genitals of little boys by their parents and physicians.  This is not a necessary procedure nor even one that provides any tangible benefits.  Maimonides, a prolific ancient Jewish scholar, said that it was designed to suppress sexual pleasure.  If it were fashionable to cut off earlobes or fingernails, people would defend it using the same arguments.  The point is that the child is a human and deserves to choose which body parts they get to keep or have removed.  If people were allowed to choose when they turned 18, I don't think circumcision would be very popular.  It isn't very popular worldwide.  Circumcision is not necessary, can pose a risk for a newborn, is designed to supress pleasure, and is the remnant of an anchient superstition.  The only reason that you are happy you had it done, that women like circumcised penises, and kids are teased is that we live in a society where most people have had this done.  If you had it, you probably wouldn't find it gross, dirty, or hard to maintain."
madisonwi,35qfmf,Exayex,-1,Tue May 12 21:26:52 2015 UTC,"Of course if I had to wait until 18 I wouldn't get it done.  Because I'd remember it and have to heal which would affect my daily adult life.  Like I said, I had it done.  Don't remember it all.  And I'm thankful I did.  Isn't there more important issues to worry about?  Or did the people who think abortion should be illegal find a new issue that doesn't affect them to piss and moan about?"
madisonwi,35qfmf,omniraden,5,Tue May 12 23:56:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think that the anti-abortion people overlap much with the anti-circumcision people. However, it seems you misunderstood me.  I am arguing that we shouldn't be cutting off parts of children without good reasons.  Cultural bias isn't a good reason to cut off parts of children.  If you lived in a culture where most people don't get circumcised, would you still be thankful?"
madisonwi,35qfmf,Exayex,2,Wed May 13 00:15:20 2015 UTC,"Probably not.  But it is the social norm in my age group.  So I am happy.  And as a ""survivor"" of this ""genital mutilation"" I have no memory of the procedure.  Really doesn't strike me as a big of a deal as people are making it.  Literally nothing but positive came from it.    I'm also curious how many people against this are middle-aged women?  Strikes me as the group rallying.  The typical ""This doesn't affect me and I should mind my own business but I have nothing better to piss my time away on"" types.  Keep in mind that if you ban circumcision you run the risk of people doing it themselves, the same as you do with abortion.  And don't doubt there are people who will do so.  So there's that to consider, as well.  Ethically, it's safer to make it an option for parents and those who disagree with it can not take part in it and educate their children."
madisonwi,35qfmf,krusten,3,Wed May 13 00:19:38 2015 UTC,"Weird. I've always associated the anti-circumcision movement with the Men's Rights movements, not with middle-aged women. If you're curious, check out the Men's Rights subreddits and see what they say."
madisonwi,35qfmf,JessBS27,9,Wed May 13 01:39:02 2015 UTC,Women are turned off by them? What are you talking about?   Source: I am a woman.
madisonwi,35qfmf,Exayex,0,Tue May 12 22:33:40 2015 UTC,"I've slept with plenty of women.  And I've discussed circumcision with a handful and all have said they prefer it.  Anecdotal evidence, yes.  But I've also known many women refuse to give oral sex to uncut men."
madisonwi,35qfmf,doxiegrl1,5,Tue May 12 23:57:50 2015 UTC,"That has to be a completely cultural preference.  If men didn't circumcise, I hypothesize women wouldn't prefer circumcised penises."
madisonwi,35qfmf,krusten,3,Wed May 13 03:33:49 2015 UTC,"First, it isn't correct to generalize women. Many of us don't give a shit about the presence or absence of foreskin. We just want happy men.  Second, I would guess the stigma of ""gross, dirty, and harder to maintain"" is due to unfamiliarity. I've gotten to know guys of both hats and neither was grosser nor seemed to fret over maintenance more than the other. I think this is a very unfair stereotype and I'm glad that people are trying to change the social opinion surrounding this. Sure, it is the norm in your age group, but that doesn't make it wrong that others would like to make the alternative more acceptable.    I was pretty neutral on the subject until my boyfriend showed me Penn & Teller's Bullshit: Circumcision episode. If I ever have a son, he's going to stay intact."
madisonwi,35qfmf,spagettparty,4,Wed May 13 01:56:41 2015 UTC,"Times are changing, it's starting to go out of style. There's a larger percentage of people not circumcising than there was in the 70s and 80s. They most likely won't get made fun of (when do you recall anyone looking at your dick in school and making fun of it, at the risk of getting caught looking at your dick, a much worse offense). And to make an assumption about what over 50% of the population prefers or even has a preference about is ludicrous. Penis's aren't dog tails, there's no breed standard, and stop fucking trying to make one. They're also no harder to maintain than any other part of your body if you're not a filthy bastard. Vaginas would probably be easier to clean without labia, so should we cut those off? It IS genital mutilation, you are cutting a piece off to make it look different. That's mutilation by definition."
madisonwi,35qfmf,PsykCheech,2,Tue May 12 21:08:08 2015 UTC,Style shouldn't really play into this.
madisonwi,35qfmf,spagettparty,3,Tue May 12 21:19:14 2015 UTC,"I agree it shouldn't, but it absolutely does. I was making a counterpoint to it being made fun of."
madisonwi,35qfmf,Exayex,0,Tue May 12 21:21:13 2015 UTC,"I was born in '89.  Maybe it is changing and I'm out of touch, I doubt it though.  But I definitely know in high school girls talked.  And if one said she slept with you and you were uncircumcized it was going to lead to harassing.  Guys talked shit and some girls were hesitant to do anything with you.  Like I said.  I'm happy I had it done.  As I said earlier in this thread, I've slept with plenty of women and the ones I talked about this with have all said they prefer circumsized.  A handful said they would not perform oral sex on an uncut male and a few said they wouldn't sleep with an uncut male because they found it gross.  Just my experience.  I had it done as an infant.  I'm happy I did.  Grateful, even.  If I have a son I'll do the same.  There are positives from it.  If it's almost no risk (nothing is 0 risk.  One could argue there's more risk to your health NOT having it done from the increased chances of STDs and infections) it's worth doing.  People need to worry about themselves more.  Don't like the procedure?  Don't have it done to yourself or your child.  Go get a hobby so you aren't sitting here wondering what everyone is doing that you can protest next."
madisonwi,35qfmf,spagettparty,6,Wed May 13 00:02:46 2015 UTC,"I have a baby son, and I made the decision not to cut him. I don't really fault anyone for cutting or being cut, I don't think it needs to be outlawed. When I saw the picture of the protesters I laughed my ass off. I just don't think having all your penis parts is a negative thing, and I don't think anyone with an uncut penis is going to have any harder of a life than anyone with a cut penis. The cleaning is not any more difficult than cleaning a cut penis (I speak from experience, mine's cut, his isn't), there is not any additional risk of STD, that's been pretty much proven, and if you got your pants off in front of a girl who wants your pants off, and they stop because they don't like what your genitals look like? I'm gonna sound like a total parent here, but you're probably better off letting her go."
madisonwi,35qfmf,Exayex,0,Wed May 13 00:23:22 2015 UTC,"Maybe.  And I agree with you.  I don't have a problem with cut or uncut.  I'm happy I'm cut.  I think it's a decision to be left to the parents and NOT these people who want to stick their nose in everybody's business.  First, it's abortion, then circumcision, and then after that, what?"
madisonwi,35qfmf,omniraden,3,Wed May 13 00:26:51 2015 UTC,"It is changing, especially outside of the US and the middle east.  The general preference of women for circumcised penises is likely cultural since most men in our society are circumcised.  I have a question though, would you make life decisions for your child based on the behavior and opinions of high schoolers?   People need to worry about themselves more. Don't like the procedure? Don't have it done to yourself or your child.   The problem is, most people have the procedure right after they are born and don't exactly have the choice.  Many have their children circumcised for the reasons you expressed.   Go get a hobby so you aren't sitting here wondering what everyone is doing that you can protest next.   My hobby is arguing with people on Reddit."
madisonwi,35qfmf,Exayex,-2,Wed May 13 00:22:58 2015 UTC,"High school is shitty enough.  If a simple procedure that is the cultural norm can prevent some ridicule, as well as make my son more appealing to women, I will gladly have it done to him.  Like I said, I had it done.  No negatives, all positives.    And last I checked, we live in the US.  So using what is fashionable outside the US as evidence for how times are changing is kind of silly.  Everybody else uses metric and I don't see protesters with signs about how we need to switch to metric.  Game shows where people get jacked off while singing are popular in Japan.  Why can't I see this shit on Fox?  Piss poor argument, in my opinion.  I'm not even religious.  I'm just happy I have a cut penis and if I have a son he will as well."

madisonwi,35qfmf,Amadameus,2,Tue May 12 23:58:45 2015 UTC,Elephant trunk = penis. It's science. /s
madisonwi,35qfmf,davidcolling,7,Tue May 12 19:03:13 2015 UTC,"I think most circumcised men, or at least me, aren't really bothered by it because we have zero recollection.  Babies basically have no attention span, they're not going to remember or be scarred by the event.  It decreases the chance of contracting a penile infection, STDs, or even penile cancer, which is a well worth some pain that I endured during my first hours.  Short term pain is worth it because it reduces long term risk of far worse things.  Circumcision is rather weird and horrifying.  It totally makes sense to not want your baby son circumcised.  Think about if your future son will be glad about your decision.  But why are these guys spending time protesting about it?  Do they want to make it illegal?  That would be a bad idea."
madisonwi,35qfmf,menuka,5,Tue May 12 20:25:21 2015 UTC,It already is illegal in places outside the U.S.
madisonwi,35qfmf,omniraden,6,Tue May 12 22:07:41 2015 UTC,"It decreases the chance of contracting a penile infection, STDs, or even penile cancer   penile infection: only if you don't wash.  STD's: no it doesn't, that's not how any STD's work.  STDs are contracted through contact with infected skin or fluids.  penile cancer: da fuq?  Again, not how cancer works.  I think circumcision of babies should be illegal.  If you want to cut it off when your older, go right ahead."
madisonwi,35qfmf,davidcolling,7,Tue May 12 21:35:40 2015 UTC,"I don't know specifics, that's just what I read.  Edit: I see what you're saying.  Circumcision doesn't do anything more to prevent if one is hygienic and sexually safe, but people aren't always hygienic and safe, and circumcision gives one better odds of avoiding such infections."
madisonwi,35qfmf,omniraden,2,Tue May 12 22:48:15 2015 UTC,"The draft recommendations are subject to a 45-day public comment period and a formal external peer review.   Important!  This CDC fact sheet details correlation between old studies in sub-saharan Africa of HIV infections and circumcision; men who have sex with women are less likely to contract HIV if they are circumcised.  Unfortunately, all these studies were stopped prematurely.  I will wait to pass judgement until peer review and double blind studies have hashed this out.  Just remember, circumcision does not prevent you from contracting HIV and vaginal intercourse is not the only way of contracting the disease."

madisonwi,35qfmf,new-money,5,Wed May 13 16:05:52 2015 UTC,"This is one of those issues that reddit blows out of proportion. Most people have never even considered the ""mutilation"" angle, but any time the subject is brought up on reddit people go crazy about it.  Calling it mutilation is seriously a stretch, and those who argue against it tend to ignore the preventative health benefits. It's not purely cosmetic or religious. It's an unnecessary part of your body that can be safely removed, such as body hair, wisdom teeth, appendix, etc. There are dozens of body parts that fall under this category and anyone who gets worked up about it doesn't consider that parents have to make life-lasting decisions for their children every day."

madisonwi,35v4he,mmmmmmmmmmichael,5,Thu May 14 01:43:00 2015 UTC,"Apart from the ruling, I'm curious if anyone was surprised by how fast the other officers were there after the shooting in the video? And that one of the ones that showed up was putting on his jacket and the other one looked actually freaked out about it? I don't know...it just seems like waiting 30 more seconds could have made a huge difference? If the policy for using a TASER is having 2 cops (in Madison) and you know this kid is actually effed up, why not wait..? If he thought there were multiple people in the house and then shot at the first thing that hit him, doesn't that automatically also put this potential ""other person"" at risk? Just questions I've been thinking about for a while. I don't know the answers, but it really really hurts to know that this happened because a dude had a horrible trip and his friends did not know what to do. Sigh."
madisonwi,35v4he,Mhm426,7,Wed May 13 23:13:03 2015 UTC,"I think that these are good questions and hopefully the MPD may have some review of their policies in the future for responding to similar situations.  It seems that it may have been a less than ideal police response (although I don't know all the details), but I also don't think that the police response was criminal. I feel that the DA is correct in not pressing any charges against the officer. It's such a sad situation, and I hope that there can be some good lessons learned from it."
madisonwi,35v4he,v-porphyria,2,Wed May 13 23:29:24 2015 UTC,"I don't know...it just seems like waiting 30 more seconds could have made a huge difference? If the policy for using a TASER is having 2 cops (in Madison) and you know this kid is actually effed up, why not wait..?    Policing is about split second decisions with limited information.   He heard someone yelling and the house getting trashed. He legitimately thought someone was getting assaulted inside the house.   There are people who think that he should have waited. But if there actually was a person upstairs with Robinson, and he beat them to death or stabbed them with the samurai sword, there would also be people who would've called Kenney a coward who failed to protect the public.   He was put in a horrible predicament that night. But the blame shouldn't fall on him. The blame falls on Robinson for consuming substances which he had no idea how his body would react to and putting the public at risk."
madisonwi,35vccs,n609mike,5,Wed May 13 20:39:47 2015 UTC,"This blog is pretty scattered and snarky, but the best takeaway is probably the last line:   And we ask that they consider that a legal shot isn’t necessarily a good shot.   I wish more protesters understood this line of thinking. I don't think anyone is arguing that the officer's actions were good. But they were clearly legal, and I think they were justified. Police safety should be a priority. These men put themselves in dangerous situations every day.  Tony Robinson delivered a concussing punch to the face. That punch could have easily knocked the officer out. The officer could have been permanently injured or killed. Ideally the officer's defense would not be fatal, but in this case it was. A moment of hesitation in a life-threatening situation is all it takes to end up dead.  In this case, the person who created the life-threatening situation ended up dead."
madisonwi,35vccs,new-money,-5,Wed May 13 21:10:31 2015 UTC,Is this what we as residents and tax payers want? Should the lethal force policy for Madison police be reconsidered?
madisonwi,35vccs,chessehead23,10,Wed May 13 20:57:15 2015 UTC,Nope. They need to protect themselves. Otherwise will have a bunch of rent-a-cops patrolling the streets.
madisonwi,35vccs,BarkMingo,3,Wed May 13 21:07:27 2015 UTC,"They need to protect themselves.   Absolutely, but ideally they should do it non-lethally.  That doesn't really exist successfully right now though.  That's why I don't think it's a Madison issue, it's a general police issue to find a better balance between self-protection and non-lethal force.  I don't have that answer, I don't know if anyone does, but it wouldn't be a bad idea for some top minds to start figuring out a better solution."
madisonwi,35vccs,chessehead23,6,Wed May 13 21:21:07 2015 UTC,We need Star Trek phasers set to stun.

madisonwi,35vccs,cakky1,-1,Wed May 13 21:33:18 2015 UTC,This is my point. I find it hard to swallow that every resident needed to die to protect the officers. The police don't exactly seem open minded to coming up with options. They act as if everything is perfect.
madisonwi,35vccs,new-money,2,Wed May 13 21:26:24 2015 UTC,"Are you ignoring all the instances where less than lethal force was used successfully where otherwise lethal force would have been needed?  AKA pre Taser days?  Would 9 officers killed to 9 residents killed appease you?  Should it be a 1:1?  2:1?  Lethal force is necessary unfortunately and the ideal ratio in a civilized society SHOULD be X:0.  The goal is for X to be 0 but that is impossible.  There are always gonna be situations, and this shooting may or may not have been one of them, where the officer or the suspect is going to die."
madisonwi,35vccs,BarkMingo,2,Wed May 13 22:12:37 2015 UTC,In 99.9% of cases our police use non-lethal force. You essentially cherry picked a handful of cases out of hundreds of thousands.

The information from those unions contained false information regarding GHC-SCW's financial condition.  We are sharing with you the following press release we have provided to local media outlets to ensure that you along with those who may report on this have accurate information from GHC-SCW.  It is a privilege to be of service to you, our members.    Thank you for choosing GHC-SCW.  GHC-SCW Refutes Unions Mischaracterization of Financial Concern Correspondence distributed by certain unions in the Dane County area contained misrepresentations regarding the financial stability of GHC-SCW.  The letters were sent to union members across the Dane County area encouraging them to vote for a slate of candidates during the upcoming GHC-SCW's Board of Directors election.  Unfortunately, the letter led some media to report inaccurate statements as fact without verification.  This has led to added confusion in the local market.  The letters suggested that ""it appears GHC-SCW will lose $17 million in 2015"".  Ken Machtan, Board President says this statement is inconsistent with GHC-SCW management's forecasted results in 2015.  During the first quarter of 2015, GHC-SCW has preliminarily reported profits in its financial results.  ""While we welcome the dialogue and democratic process of board elections, these unions have been longstanding GHC-SCW employer groups and we would have preferred that they verified their information before disseminating it,"" says Machtan. While GHC-SCW has incurred losses in the past, these were covered by GHC-SCW's substantial reserves so no debt was accumulated.  GHC-SCW continues to maintain a healthy reserve.  Over the last two years GHC-SCW has experienced 10% growth in its membership.  Significant investments have been made to the organization, all focused on providing better service experiences for GHC-SCW members.   GHC-SCW is a nonprofit health plan that cares for 82,000 members.  The Cooperative has served the greater Dane County area for nearly 40 years and provides both insurance and clinical services for our members.

Would you be unable to pay the copay? Usually you can pay it in person, so your parents wouldn't have to pay it.  Honestly, your best bet is asking the folks you have been seeing if there are any options they suggest. Low cost stuff is all full up, and since you do technically have insurance, those places are going to turn you away.  That said, if you have patience and free time on Wednesday mornings, head to the Journey Mental Health Center down town (be there by 8 for intake) and talk with them. They might have some suggestions or ways to help.  Sorry I can't offer more. Low cost health services are just completely overrun right now.

You also have to prove that the car belongs to you or someone in your immediate family, so you can't have your friend claim your car as their own.   $160/month seems pretty reasonable for underground parking. Like localgyro pointed out, outdoor/street parking in the winter is a bitch. You might be able to save yourself $50/month to park in an outdoor lot somewhere off-campus, but that's really your best-case scenario. I would say cough-up the underground parking cost or reconsider bringing your car here.  FWIW I paid for underground parking at my last place and it was worth EVERY PENNY!"

I would drive around the area you are willing to park in and look for signs. I know specifically of a 3-car garage with a ""parking space for rent"" sign on Grand Ave between Kendall and Stevens.  $160/month is normal for downtown. It's not normal for the hospital area, except the big complexes. If you can find another place nearby it should be quite a bit cheaper."

If this was more about a large social movement, why did it need the death of a mushroom-addled man with a history of violence to do it? Why couldn't, say, any of the other injustices out there be the cause?   This, I think, is my major problem. The majority of the protesters are simply looking for an excuse. They don't really care, either. They're angry and they don't even know what or why they're angry, just that they are. They refuse to address that there could be any problems inside the black community - it is always white people forcing them down. Could it be the disdain for education so many black neighborhoods demonstrate? Could it be any number of issues within black culture that is compounded by potential racial discrimination outside of that culture? But no. It's not black culture's fault. It's white people. Always. Right? Isn't that what the protests are all about?   Why no protests of people who blast very loud music at 2am on a school night while their young elementary-school children are trying to sleep? Why no protests of the anti-education bias that is so evident? No protests against the concept that reading and learning just makes you a nerd and not cool?  And why is any sort of questioning of the motives of these people immediately regarded as racist and ignorant? I live in the ghetto. I worked at a very rough Walmart for years. I am surrounded by black lives and I've seen a lot of the crap that happens. I'm not ignorant. I'm not racist. I wouldn't live as the only white guy in a large neighborhood if I was. I merely voice frustration that there are many reasons people should be protesting but ""justice4tony"" isn't one of them.  I'm sorry if I am not wording this well.

As for the 'blacklivesmatter' hashtag, just because something invokes race doesn't make it racist: 'blacklivesmatter' isn't somehow saying that other lives don't matter, it's a re-affirmation of the value of black life in the face of an American society that often results in broken, black lives.   As soon as I bring up anything, including an elephant in the room, you say that I'm making assumptions with racist undertones. Nicely ironic, there.   Maybe because a lot of what you said was racist and ignorant to some degree? The thing I took issue with the most was the idea that somehow black communities aren't trying to better themselves. There's just not a lot of news coverage of peaceful protests (see coverage of Tony Robinson's protests vs Baltimore/Ferguson) or other good things that happen."
madisonwi,35mwzs,iamsmrtk,0,Tue May 12 20:00:02 2015 UTC,"The majority of the protesters are simply looking for an excuse. They don't really care, either.   Wow.   Could it be any number of issues within black culture that is compounded by potential racial discrimination outside of that culture? But no. It's not black culture's fault. It's white people. Always. Right?   No.  Of course not.   And why is any sort of questioning of the motives of these people immediately regarded as racist and ignorant?    Ignorant?  Perhaps.  If you think the majority of the protestors don't care, and are only looking for excuses to be disruptive.   Racist? Perhaps. If you say things like ""these people"", ""It's not black culture's fault. It's white people. Always."", followed up with ""I'm not racist.""  Look, I'm not calling you racist.  But if you keep saying things that racist people like to say, I can't exactly call you ""not racist"" either..."

The proof of this, is that people with money, who have bails of both less and more than $1,000 are not kept in jail—and this is not considered a public safety issue."

The protests here have been peaceful, with the only arrests being for people not wanting to stop protesting after the police told them to go home, or credentialed members of the press getting arrested for documenting everything after being told to leave.   The reason why using the National Guard for something like this is such a touchy subject is because of Wisconsin's history. In 1886 the troops (back then it was not the National Guard, but a state militia) were called in to suppress a bunch of workers protesting for an 8-hour work day in Milwaukee, and they ended up firing into the crowd and killing a bunch of people.   To call in the National Guard would require the Govenor's authorization, but he probably wouldn't hesitate to do it now. It's also the polar opposite of Koval's community-based police approach."

The rides start in Middleton, which is a short ride or drive to get to from Madison. The ride then leaves in waves. You can try to roll with the front group and hang with some of the fastest racers and riders in the area, or just take it easy towards the back with more casual riders. The skill level is all over the place. It's pretty easy to find other people around your pace to ride with. Whatever pace you choose, all roads lead back at the brewery and their spacious outdoor beer garden where tasty post-ride beers and food await. It's a great way to learn some new routes and make new friends and riding buddies."

I like hip hop personally and have seen about five of my favorite artists in the last year.  I'd assume the same goes for indie stuff but I'm not as well versed, like you said Saint Vincent came through.  I know Dan Deacon is coming through this Friday for example.  There's more than enough music to keep you busy.  Being close to the university has a lot of pros and some cons.

Basically the four month stretch of May - August.  Campus/Downtown is basically reclaimed by the normal people during summer when a lot of students leave. The terrace has a whole different feel, we have an amazing Farmer's market on the capitol square every Saturday, and there are festivals every single weekend.  The weather in September and October is still nice. The students come back and you kind of realize you missed the energy they bring to this city. Go to a badger football game even if you hate football -- the energy is amazing (although I recommend going before it gets cold out).  December - March is brutal. I've lived in Madison my entire life and I still think it's brutal. But we get through it. Enjoy outdoor activities in the snow when you're up for it and find some good indoor activities like reading, movies, and hot chocolate. Everyone takes dressing warm seriously. You walk into a classy bar on a Saturday night and everyone has their ugly big puffy coats, which I kind of like. In winter we value function, and everyone kind of bands together to fight the weather. People will lend shovels or help dig out your car if you're stuck. Small talk is super easy -- just curse at the weather and groan. It's kind of nice... for a few weeks."

There are lots of good activities in the winter too, beer drinking being a personal favorite.  Madison has a general hippy hipster vibe to it, definitely stronger over on Willy street. Summer is basically the time school is out for, from now until Early September.  The downtown takes on a very relaxed/laid-back vibe when school is not in session.  And as I'm sure you'll get tired of hearing, the terrace is great.  You can basically show up there at random and there will be great live music playing."
madisonwi,35mymv,olicanoli,3,Mon May 11 21:47:46 2015 UTC,"I'm mostly a shorter distance trail runner. Around town The UW Arboretum and Picnic Point Nature Preserve offer nice local trails for training.   The Ice Age Trail winds all over Wisconsin, with many miles running through the North and South units of the Kettle Moraine State Forest. Blue Mounds, Governer Dodge and Devils Lake State parks are a short drive away and offer many miles of hilly trails. Northern Wisconsin with its national forests is great for canoeing, camping, and hiking.  There are a lot of Trail runs in WI.   I have done Hartman Creek half marathon which is part of the Great Lakes Endurance Series and the Chippewa Moraine 50k.   Upper Michigan also has a lot of protected forests and trails and makes a good destination for a longer weekend. There is a very nice 25k at Tahquamenon Falls State Park in August."

Downtown/campus is more expensive and generally students & epic employees. If you are later 20s then you might appreciate the near east side like Williamson street, Atwood neighborhoods. Or Vilas/Monroe on the near west where housing and parking will be a little less expensive.

madisonwi,35mymv,olicanoli,2,Tue May 12 00:22:13 2015 UTC,"I was gonna say, I glanced at this list and at first I thought it was a list of things you like about Madison. I'm moving back there in two months and that's basically a full list of everything I miss! (though I would specifically add cheap brunch to the list) My favorite part about it is that nature is never too far away. I've lived in a couple different areas around downtown, and there are lots of preserves like the Arboretum or the Lakeshore Trail path that are just gorgeous and literally IN the city/along the sides of it. Right now I'm living in Paris (which, ok, it's Paris and it's way bigger) but I need to travel more than an hour if I want to see real forest and I miss being able to travel like, 15 minutes. The music scene is also fantastic. The fall before last was stacked -- I saw Tame Impala, Unknown Mortal Orchestra, Animal Collective, Father John Misty, and a couple other super legit bands within the span of a few weeks. We've got tons of venues and I saw you wrote somewhere that you're not a big arena fan -- me neither, and Madison definitely caters to that smaller-venue feel. Milwaukee is only an hour or so away as well, I saw Foxygen there once which was sweet. And for the really big shows which you sometimes might wanna see, you've got the Twin Cities about 4.5 hours away or Chicago about 3 hours away (but my family is in Chicago so I'm always looking for a reason to visit/tons of my friends live in the twin cities) so that's always an option too. I could honestly go on and on about every item on that list and how Madison is great at it, so let me know if you want me to elaborate on any of the points in particular. Food is fantastic, beer is fantastic. God, I can't even talk to my friends here about beer because I realized that my favorite beers mostly come from in and around Madison. Looking at you, New Glarus and Capital. Can't give you many specifics on intense running, though, I run but probably can't consider myself ~a runner~ though I do know it's very popular and there are always loads of people on the trails.

I worked in the Senate for a year but got bored really quickly and wanted to go back to school for a little bit. Through some friends, found out about this program which is a one-year long graduate program in international relations, all in French, based out of a French law school so a lot of it has to do with the basics of international law. It's super cool and I've enjoyed it a lot! The goal was basically to gain fluency in French and get the study abroad experience that I never got in undergrad :) It's somewhere between a bachelor's and a master's, so the degree itself doesn't matter too much, it was more about the experience.

Its Quick-Start Guide is in need of some readers, there are some mechanics that are in need of testing, and of course the whole thing needs to be aggressively broken. All levels of experience with RPGs are valued in their own ways, from 100% newbie to grizzled grognard. I've gotten people from zero to sixty in about half an hour, so even if you have no idea how RPGs work, don't feel that that would somehow disqualify you from participating! All you need are basic math skills and more than a bit of patience.  On the other hand, for people who've spent hundreds of hours in basements playing tabletop games — imagine D&D with the combat system torn out and replaced by Phoenix Command, who is rudely denied tables and forced to make do with dice. Out-of-the-box thinkers who enjoy abusing technicalities, min-maxers who get their jollies from exposing hugely broken character builds and quick-on-their-feet people who can adapt to ruleset hotfixes would all be appreciated.  Hit me up, maybe we can grab a table at a local game store at some point. I'm relatively new to Madison / completely new to the tabletop scene. :)"

madisonwi,35hfic,sideshow1138,7,Sun May 10 20:12:02 2015 UTC,Sounds like a weird or socially awkward guy trying to connect with people using a language he's not fully comfortable with. That's the most positive impression I got from your description. Asking about where parties are is not unusual on campus. Only you can decide if it was weird enough that you need to report it for some reason.
madisonwi,35hfic,bobbaddeley,-1,Sun May 10 12:10:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get what you're saying, totally agree maybe I was just paranoid and need to let it go. It was all just so strange and different. I don't know any other way to put it."
madisonwi,35hfic,ayeuguise,3,Sun May 10 12:14:32 2015 UTC,Sketchy shit at the Cardinal? Nawwww
madisonwi,35hfic,owlboy,3,Sun May 10 12:55:41 2015 UTC,"I'm confused. What was your reaction? You just said it was weird, you didn't say what you did or are thinking of doing.  Sure, it's weird, but sounds normal for a bar, and especially the Cardinal on Latin night. I've been a few times to dance, but the guy/girl ratio was always so skewed that the guys would get more aggressive. If you're looking for some good Tango/Salsa, go to the Brink on Tuesdays at 9pm. That's a much friendlier and welcoming dance scene."
madisonwi,35hfic,owlboy,3,Sun May 10 13:44:45 2015 UTC,Report it to whom and for what?  you say there is more to the story but have yet to divulge even to strengthen your case. All we can offer advice on is a pair of guys in a bar gave you fake names (maybe thear name  is complicated and decided to go with an American one for ease) and they asked for addresses for parties and your home. What would they have to gain by any of this info other than a hangover?
madisonwi,35hfic,cakky1,1 point,Mon May 11 09:11:21 2015 UTC,"Overly confident guy high on weed was looking for a hookup, or a place to hookup.

IDK, but that close to a military base it's entirely possible they were attempting to find someone that does."

They go to bars near military posts/bases (not TOO close) and engage people in conversation until they find one that is willing to give up information after a few beers, mostly seemingly innocuous information..  Maybe they do nothing with it, maybe they find out there is drill at 115th that weekend and run the gate in an attempt to kill/maim as many military members as they can."

madisonwi,35c3aj,BadThoughtProcess,5,Sat May 9 04:50:22 2015 UTC,Am I insane or would you have to literally stand around doing nothing to make less than minimum wage? I think most servers are very well compensated. Perhaps this is not true in other cities
madisonwi,35c3aj,vatoniolo,4,Sat May 9 00:52:46 2015 UTC,"My gf was a server at Red Robin back in 2007. She got $2.50 an hour and had to supply her own bank, she was required to have $100 in change. So if you think about it her position paid less than minimum wage and had a $100 buy in. On a good night she could make $200 in tips but this was once in a blue moon.  Either way, at the time I worked minimum wage in a taco bell and consistently brought home more money than her. I don't see how a single adult could support themselves as a server and I'm positive a parent couldn't support even a single child without state aid.  I think it's profoundly naive to believe servers make anything resembling a livable wage and personally I hope you never find yourself in a position desperate enough to accept that kind of work."
madisonwi,35c3aj,layer555,3,Sat May 9 21:30:23 2015 UTC,I left my job as a busser less than a month ago. I was making close to $20 an hour. The servers made at least 1.5 times that.   This is downtown and definitely not at Red Robin. I guess I didn't qualify that properly
madisonwi,35c3aj,vatoniolo,-2,Sat May 9 21:39:18 2015 UTC,That's actually a really good point I hadn't thought about. You could make serious bank at a fancy restaurant. Personally I'd rather clean toilets than wait on rich people though.
madisonwi,35c3aj,layer555,1 point,Sun May 10 00:05:48 2015 UTC,"I really wouldn't call all of the restaurants downtown ""fancy."" It's not fine dining. Maybe a few places but most of them are casual. I think you have the wrong perception of downtown Madison."
madisonwi,35c3aj,LizziePeep,11,Wed May 13 23:11:46 2015 UTC,"I'm sure other people will bring this up too, but CBI and Essen Haus have seriously high turnover rates (even for restaurants). They share a kitchen and manager the staff is often shuffled between the two restaurant. Saying Neihl (manager of the two restaurants) is difficult to work for would be an understatement. I think a yelp review described him well as an ""authoritarian Eeyore."" He's been known to do things like contradict himself in his instructions and yell at servers and hosts in front of customers. I worked there a short time before finding something that suited my schedule better. Also, summer can be slow and they do not pay us to minimum wage on nights your tips don't get you there.   On the other hand, a lot of great people do work at EH and CBI (or did when I was there last year) and it was a welcoming little community. Also from what I've heard from other former employees who stayed in the restaurant industry, Neihl has a reputation around town so if you can say you worked for him for 6 months you can get a job a lot of other places easily."
madisonwi,35c3aj,camus_canoe,2,Sat May 9 00:20:45 2015 UTC,"Ahh Neihl. What an old crotch.   I remember sitting at the bar in the CBI one night with a couple friends. Despite being quite a few people at the bar, it was pretty quiet (no band). So Neihl decided he was going to fix the door between the CBI and Essen Haus. He had one tool - a hammer. He ended up ripping off a piece of the ceiling and getting really angry. It was hysterical. The bartenders just gave us a look like ""Yeah, that seems about right."""

He's not really as bad as everyone makes him out to be, but he is definitely difficult. Talk to Jaime about him, she'll have good advice. The staff is pretty nice, most of them hang out at the Up North (same ownership but much, much better management) where I know them from.  BTW $2.33 an hour is standard server wage. Bartenders make more but you couldn't pay me enough to want to do it, personally. If you just moved here I suggest you take the job, but definitely keep an eye out for something better."
madisonwi,35bh0x,ouijabore,24,Fri May 8 18:43:44 2015 UTC,Drive over tonight around 1030. Its the only way to know if your opinion is the same as everyone else. Its not nice by Madison standards but Madison has high standards.
madisonwi,35bh0x,n609mike,10,Fri May 8 19:28:23 2015 UTC,"That used to be a more dangerous neighborhood than it is now.  These days it's safer than '95-'07 but still has higher than normal violent and property crime for Madison.  Services are generally poor because the area is sandwiched by the railroad, beltline, and Alliant Energy Center; access to and from the rest of the city is narrowed to a few main roads. If you don't mind driving everywhere and living in a poorer area, lower rent could make it worth it."
madisonwi,35bh0x,PanamaNorth,3,Fri May 8 19:55:10 2015 UTC,"Hey everyone, thanks so much for the input and help! I took the advice of driving over there at night and it seemed okay to me. Unfortunately for me my dad is my consigner (credit is being slowly repaired), checked out crime reports and ""other things"" he wouldn't explain, and refused to sign. He said the area was too questionable and sketchy for me to live by myself. So crap. I do appreciate all the info from everyone though!"

madisonwi,35bh0x,AdShea,9,Mon May 11 03:13:51 2015 UTC,"So, we live in the neighborhood, spend a lot of time at the Library with the kids, play at the playground, walk around a lot.  We've never had a problem.  That said, it's a lower income neighborhood.  You don't get perks like the co-op, or whole foods or nice selection at the liquor store.  It's a predominantly Africans american neighborhood, and as much as Madison likes to be progressive, well, people told me I shop at the ghetto Copps with a straight face, so, I guess you'll see, people like to pretend to be progressive, but you're going to see a lot of bullshit.  That said, I like it here.  There's a secret back entrance to the Alliant Energy Center, you're close to the dog run, there's the Goodman pool in the summer, a grocery store close by (the Copps), a really great library with fantastic librarians.  The Asian grocery is good too, Park is super convenient for getting to and from anywhere in town.  I like it here, I'll support this neighborhood to the end of the day even after 10:30pm (what the fuck are those comments about?)"

madisonwi,35bh0x,tb_throwaway,2,Sat May 9 06:37:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, seriously. I work on S Park, and really, it's very safe. There's a little bit of nuisance crime--you should keep your car doors locked, avoid the South Transfer Point at night, and you might get panhandled at stores. But it's cheap, there are some nice parks and the Arboretum close by, lots of great restaurants, good library, bike shop...and you're a 5-10 minute drive from both Willy St and the near west side. I will agree that the Copps sucks, though. I shop at Mercado Marimar."

They were more of the hipster type, so they really fit in there.  Like others have said: take a drive over and see if you like the neighborhood and what it has to offer."
madisonwi,35bh0x,JKibbs,1 point,Sat May 9 03:41:07 2015 UTC,I like the east side - I'm fairly close to Willy street and Atwood - but I work west and an tired of the drive.
madisonwi,35bh0x,Mousybj,1 point,Sat May 9 01:56:28 2015 UTC,"If that's the case, I wouldn't really recommend it... depending on how west you have to go. I live East, and had a job out in Middleton for about a year and the beltline is just going to be an issue up to about the Verona road area no matter what.  From where you're talking about moving, you will still have most of the problems with traffic, but you'll lose everything that's awesome about the Willy Street/Atwood area. Not a worthwhile change.  So here's what I'd recommend: depending on how west you work, take a look at commuting north around the lake. For me, at certain times of the day when I still have to go west, this is actually much faster than the beltline. Especially with any accidents.  If you really want to get less travel time, I'd look at Verona or Middleton apartments. This will really give you a drive time savings, and you'll have better access to groceries dining and activities."

I would run along Park St up the hill by the BK, back near the trailer park area and come back through the neighborhood from the direction of the Alliant without incident.  I kept my moped and car in the parking lot and never experienced any theft, vandalism, etc.    TL,DR: If 'entry level' apartments are what you need, these are great options in a nice neighborhood.

madisonwi,35cbl6,beloitpiper,2,Sat May 9 16:51:41 2015 UTC,"I've done some backpacking in the Hiawatha national forest (east side of the UP) that was nice. My strategy (and I think this works for Ottawa as well) was to hike a section of the North Country Trail. The NCT will at the very least be marked with blue blazes, and there are maps available for purchase. There are also a lot of backcountry sites along it. Trail condition will depend on the local chapter. I did a 130 miler from the two hearted river mouth (east of pictured rocks) to Mackinac, and maybe 70% was well maintained, the rest was a bit overgrown. The entire trail runs from N Dakota to New York. I liked it because I didn't have to worry about permission, private land, etc, or getting lost (except for when I missed a blaze and thus a turn). Pretty sure the NTC goes through the Ottawa national forest, so that's my suggestion."

If the readers of this subreddit want to allow your marketing efforts that is their right.  However, I don't think they appreciate your blatant lies. You are an organizer of the league. You promote it. You've been involved for a year. But you've ""only played like 3 times""? And the way you post just seems shady... ""My friend and I are playing in the tournament"" ... and also organize and profit from it. At least disclose the fact that this is your business.

Yes, I run a league, thank you for bringing that up. The Kubb league I run is in its first ever season. It is on Monday nights, not Saturdays, and started last Monday. Not sure where you got a year from, obviously you haven't stalked me quite hard enough yet. Anyways that was the third time I played.  The first two times were last fall in my back yard. I'm surprised you weren't there watching us play through binoculars.  I did not organize the tournament, nor do I have any affiliation with it whatsoever. As you can see on the about page, that organization was started years before I started my own business here. And the organizer listed right there is Aaron Berry. My name is Justin, which is not Aaron.  In conclusion, get a hobby. Seriously. I'm flattered you've taken such interest in me, but you need to move on.  Ps.

madisonwi,356gib,895342,7,Thu May 7 14:35:30 2015 UTC,"I am obviously interested (see below) in this topic so thank you for posting the event information.  This topic is a big deal because the groups listed in the title of the talk are enemies of reason and civilization and not just Islam itself.  In fact, if anything, they are taking a literal view of the book and the religion, so in that sense the speaker would be the enemy of Islam just as some liberal Christians are enemies of Christianity according to a literal reading of the Bible (see European history for evidence of this).  Fundamentalist religionists are just people who take to heart the fundamental positions of the religious books.  I think that the core problem is people believing things because they have faith and the dogma that arises from it (theocratic and secular dogma are bad).  Faith is not a good way of finding out what is true and anything can be justified by faith, even mass murder (especially so when the founding books explicitly endorse sectarian violence and bigotry).  When someone says they believe because they have faith, all I hear is ""I am gullible and I think that is virtuous.""  Better to teach people not to believe in things for which they do not have good and verifiable evidence, what constitutes good evidence, and how to discover and vet sources.  Also, the more extraordinary the claim, the more extraordinary the evidence required to justify the claim.  Islam needs a revolution from within so that the majority of believers ignore the bad parts of their religion, just as the majority of Christians and Jews now ignore the evil stuff in their religious texts.  All other religions in the developed world have been dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century, fighting every change along the way (eg. homosexuality in the US).  The way to achieve this is through education and education is only available in stable environments.  To get a stable environment in the middle east, where most of today's violent theocrats live, we may have to employ judicious violence.  Perhaps even ousting a fascistic theocratic head of state such as Saddam Hussein.  According to polls of beliefs, the majority of muslims around the world are in favor of things like ""death for apostates"" or a theocratic state (good question to ask the speaker).  We must protect those who want to temper Islam against the theocratic fascists so that they can change their religion from within.  It would appear that this speaker is one of those individuals so I will support his movement, although I still think that his religion is ridiculous (and therefore deserving of ridicule).  Edit: Saddam is a bad example.  Pick another bad guy."
madisonwi,356gib,omniraden,8,Thu May 7 16:03:29 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, you think Saddam was theocratic?  Dude was a Ba'athist, a secular nationalist party. He did a shitload of modernization and education in Iraq. The reason everyone hates him is cause of all the human rights abuses he did to people who wanted a theocracy. He literally did what you're suggesting when he employed judicious violence to create stability in the form of a dictatorship.  I'm in awe: you couldn't have picked a worse example if you tried. Maybe Bashar Al-Assad or Kadyrov if you give him more time."
madisonwi,356gib,luke37,2,Fri May 8 02:02:48 2015 UTC,"You are right, I don't know what I was thinking when I wrote this.  Although, to defend what I said a little bit, the guy did have the phrase ""Allahu akbar"" added to the Iraqi flag in his hand-writing in 1991.  Additionally, the Baathist party membership was mostly Shi'ite and there was a pseudo-religion was built around Saddam including witch-hunts for dissenters.  Religion was also employed by the the government in other ways to oppress and categorize people and it definitely plays a big role in the problems they have right now.  Seems to me it was a blend of Islamic-fascism and totalitarian state socialism.  Edit: Oh and don't compare what I said to recommending violence to instate a dictatorship.  I clearly suggested it to protect those who don't want to or can't defend themselves."
madisonwi,356gib,omniraden,2,Fri May 8 02:52:11 2015 UTC,"No, it definitely wasn't Islamic facism. It was crypto-Arab nationalism, if anything. The stamping out dissidents was overwhelmingly secular. The flag is as meaningless of a gesture as can be made, and in no way resembles actual policy."

It's really upsetting.  I hate that we are still throwing people in jail for pot.  I have no problem regulating marijuana. But it makes no sense to keep throwing people in jail over it.  I also blame the local medium for its coverage of these kinds of busts.  I understand that to some it's still ""news"" on some level.  But it seems like the local media is still in some sense glorifying these kinds of busts if they don't put it in a broader context of a failed war on drugs.  For example,  the Wisconsin State Journal doesn't even allow comments on stories like this one. That's probably for the better because every time they posted an article about a bust like this I would be all over Wisconsin State Journal's ass, asking them why they don't report in a more unbiased way.  I want them to stop glorifying these busts and report them for what they are:  an archaic relic of a bygone legal justice system, a relic and a system that continue to ruin people's lives and waste taxpayer money over drugs that many people want legalized.    Don't even get me started on how alcohol is far more damaging to our society than marijuana usage..."

Also there is a train yard on the east side I believe, so if they were moving some engines around, they may have been going back and forth by the crossing (near the Packers Ave. area I think it is).   Fully gated crossing would be the only way to not have them blow their horns, but those are expensive.   Source: Used to live in Flagstaff, AZ (the most train traffic in the US, seriously it was like every 10-15 minutes I think)"

madisonwi,351w9p,WinnebagoStreamliner,9,Wed May 6 20:50:11 2015 UTC,"If you live near some train tracks unfortunately it's just business as usual. If you live near a rail yard, like the one on the northeast side of Madison, residents are use to it. They operate in the yard during relatively normal business hours, but there are days/nights when they hold unusual hours. In the rail yard, the engineer communicates his intentions to move the train by using a series of air horn blasts. Two consecutive horn blasts means the engine is moving forward and three horn blasts indicates it is backing up. This lets anyone working on or near the tracks know that the train is going to move. Not everyone in the rail yard has a portable radio to communicate with the engineer. The rail lines and rail yard were here long before your home was. While I don't like the late night horns, sometimes it happens."

Yes the horns are frustrating, I think if the city invests in safer signals then they are not required to horn as much...although I'm sure it is up to the conductor at the end of the day. If there is a fine, I doubt it is being enforced."
madisonwi,351w9p,JerseyGooner,10,Wed May 6 13:19:49 2015 UTC,"I was told that Wisconsin & Southern Railroad actually offered to pay for gated crossings so they could get through town faster, but the neighbors didn't want a fast train in their backyard.

Edit to add that I don't actually care all that much as it doesn't bother me and I understand the necessity.  It just seems a lot more drawn on than usual so I wonder if there's a new conductor or something passing through?  Is that even the right word?  Clearly I know nothing about trains."

madisonwi,34yazb,internet_sage,7,Tue May 5 15:55:44 2015 UTC,500 beers in bottles seems like a bad plan for quality.  I would definitely avoid ordering any hoppy beers in bottles because I cannot imagine many of them will turnover fast enough.
madisonwi,34yazb,ResidentEnt,4,Tue May 5 22:52:53 2015 UTC,"I've hit a couple of similar places in different cities, and they were both major mistakes. If you don't have the traffic to turn over your beers, they go bad. And you really, REALLY need to keep your lines clean, especially if you have beers on tap that sit there for months at a time."
madisonwi,34yazb,internet_sage,1 point,Wed May 6 00:56:21 2015 UTC,Looks like taps are cycled weekly! Should this help?
madisonwi,34yazb,KishiruKrew,1 point,Fri May 8 18:44:59 2015 UTC,Taps are actually cycled DAILY.
madisonwi,34yazb,imaginarypunctuation,1 point,Fri May 15 18:08:04 2015 UTC,"You're quite the optimist. I'm the exact opposite. They say they cycle and clean daily, but do they? And if they do the week they open, for how long do they continue to do that? As long as business is good? Until the owners start getting sidetracked with another venture and someone less detail-oriented starts running the day-to-day operation? Until business goes down and they start cutting staff hours to keep their heads above water?   I'm really not interested in what they say they're going to do, nor even if they are doing it right the first month or two of business. What it comes down to is a lot of staff time, equipment, and attention to detail to care for that many beers, and they need to keep it up, month after month, year after year.   I've seen it go pretty badly a few times now, and I'm now a steadfast believer in quality over quantity. Who knows, maybe these guys will be my first data point of someone who does it right. But I have a sneaking suspicion that in the next year or two we'll be steering people away due to too many fouled beers."

madisonwi,34yazb,Hosko817,1 point,Tue May 5 23:12:09 2015 UTC,This really diversifies the options between locations. I can go to the Middleton one in the afternoon and the Wauwatosa one in the evening and have a totally different beer menu.

Specifically a study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that salt vaporizers improved cystic-fibrosis symptoms in the patients they looked at. However the frequency of use was likely much greater than the salt room (since it was twice daily).

madisonwi,34y58n,n609mike,3,Tue May 5 15:10:40 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I don't think the weather is going to cooperate with us."
madisonwi,34z6xk,Tedski44,4,Tue May 5 19:51:33 2015 UTC,"Check the FAQ for more information: Visiting Madison   Compared to big cities, traffic is not bad. Rush hour can get a little busy, especially getting through the isthmus/downtown area. Make sure to pay attention to the one-way streets downtown. 2:00-2:30. They are normal people. If you like doughnuts, Greenbush Bakery on Regent St. The Memorial Union terrace is also very nice in summer. No, we don't really have bad areas. There are some areas I would not walk through alone at night. Downtown is relatively safe, but if you're stumbling home after a night of drinking just stick to the main streets."
madisonwi,34z6xk,new-money,3,Tue May 5 20:22:56 2015 UTC,"Controversial opinion: Greenbush Bakery has the best doughnuts in town, but they aren't anything too out of the ordinary in the grand scheme of doughnut-ing. Greenbush Bar, on the other hand, is pretty bad ass. I second the opinion that the best parts of Madison are being outdoor. This city is just a phenomenal place to be outside if the weather is right. It's also one of the most accommodating bike scenes in the country.  As for food/alcohol, I wouldn't recommend anything unique from what you would find on UrbanSpoon. If you are a beer nut, I'd personally recommend Brasserie V.   If you're looking for overnight accommodations, I would recommend Air BaB on the near east side or Vilas neighborhood. I've only had positive experiences using this service, and you would get a more local Madison experience this way. If you really want to stay in a hotel, stay downtown 100%. This city is spread out, and it will be a pain to get from place to place if you are on the peripheries. No part of Madison is remotely unsafe.   Oh, and the touristy things are actually pretty cool here. The capitol is quite amazing, for example."
madisonwi,34z6xk,1st-rate,2,Tue May 5 22:36:00 2015 UTC,If you think no place is remotely unsafe then you haven't been everywhere in Madison. Hippies and hipster goofs think that everyone in Madison loves dope and peace and that strangers are just friends that you haven't met yet. Madison doesn't have places like parts of Detroit or Chicago but there are a few areas where strangers walking will not be welcomed.
madisonwi,34z6xk,likeahorse15,3,Wed May 6 03:15:18 2015 UTC,"Really? Where? I've lived off south park and the beltline and never felt unsafe late at night biking/walking alone. Maybe I'm ignorant, but I don't hear too much in the way of spontaneous petty/violent mugging. It seems like most crime is premeditated and happens in relatively unexpected establishments; I remember last year there were robberies at Glass Nickel and Players, as well as a shooting (no injuries) at Brass Ring. Most violent crime I hear about is among provoked individuals. I have one friend who was held up and robbed, but of course this type of thing can happen anywhere. I don't know if I would ever concern myself with this enough to avoid certain places. Maybe I should start, though!"
madisonwi,34z6xk,1st-rate,1 point,Wed May 6 04:03:05 2015 UTC,"Well I think you are right about crime in Madison being less random. But this is completely unscientific but my guess is that despite Madison's lip service to progressive values, it's still very racially segregated. Not the UW professors or folks who have money. They are all happy to sip wine together and talk about how wonderful they are. But poor blacks, poor whites and poor Hispanics? They live in very segregated places. And if you choose to walk in one of those poor enclaves outside your race on a hot July mighty, things may not turn out well for you. The poor people are smart enough not to do that. For the rich folks it would never occur to them to do that because they would have to face their hypocrisy. But these tensions are there. Again, nothing compared to other cities but it still exists."
madisonwi,34z6xk,likeahorse15,1 point,Wed May 6 15:34:06 2015 UTC,"Agreed. These tensions do exist. I guess what I'm saying, though, is that regardless of socioeconomic status or racial division, crime is mitigated enough to have marginal consequence on a day-to-day basis. It's always wise to walk with with both eyes open, especially if you're a female or smaller person. Regardless, I  still don't know if petty crime is more likely in a poorer and more diverse neighborhood.  I'm sure there are statistics on this. I could be wrong. Even if it's higher, I don't know whether it's a big enough issue to be a concern to me personally."
madisonwi,34z6xk,1st-rate,2,Wed May 6 15:52:02 2015 UTC,Second Greenbush but would say downtown is probably the least safe part of town. This is mainly true for wasted people stumbling home after bars close. The least safe area of madison is probably equal to the most safe place in almost any other town.
madisonwi,34z6xk,n609mike,6,Tue May 5 22:12:29 2015 UTC,"Things you ""have"" to do include going to the farmer's market on the square on Saturday mornings, getting some cheese curds at the Old Fashioned, renting a bike (available via stations around town) and exploring the cities many bike paths, hike out to picnic point, take a day and visit all of the local breweries, go to a Madison Mallards game, and so so much more."

I mostly go to get breakfast in the spring since the veggies and fruits I want don't come until later.  Apparently, the spicy cheese bread is a huge thing.  Personally, I wasn't too impressed.  There are some fantastic bakeries and cheese makers.     Personally, I really enjoy the food in Madison.  There's lots of great places on Williamson or Atwood streets (Monty's, Halong Bay, Lazy Janes), which are closer to the east side but near enough to downtown.   Salvatore's is an artisan pizza place.    Sadly, you're coming too early for all the free outdoor concerts that take place in the summer around town.  However, maybe check out Olbrich Gardens.  Admission is free on Saturday mornings."

madisonwi,34xio7,LilyGessert,3,Tue May 5 13:55:09 2015 UTC,I heard they treat their employees really well but it depends on what regime of lordship aka management they are at the time those folks I spoke to worked there. I see this add posted too many times which is ALWAYS a red flag.
madisonwi,34xio7,new-money,3,Wed May 6 14:47:48 2015 UTC,"Not the answer you're looking for, but why don't you just apply? All of your questions will be answered during the interview process.  I have seen their designer positions posted a lot as well (I was looking a couple years ago, but never applied). I imagine they have decently high turnover, but also hire a lot. They are a big company with a lot of advertising needs. When I was working as a graphic designer for a marketing team elsewhere, it became obvious that I would not last long. 90% of design positions pay like shit, and people tend to treat you like an ""art monkey"". Everyone thinks they know what looks good and what looks bad. You end up changing your designs based on what someone else tells you to do and the creative aspect is lost. You don't get a raise for being a great designer -- you always have to keep building your portfolio and try to land a better gig elsewhere.  Sorry, that was just my bad experience in the graphic design world. I expanded my skills to become a web designer, and now developer. Good luck."
madisonwi,34xio7,new-money,4,Tue May 5 13:49:19 2015 UTC,"I was planning to apply anyway, but figured it didn't hurt to ask here.

You end up changing your designs based on what someone else tells you to do and the creative aspect is lost. You don't get a raise for being a great designer -- you always have to keep building your portfolio and try to land a better gig elsewhere.   That's my problem, I'm hoping to make more money but am realizing I can't really advance more than merit raises in my current position. I've thought about expanding my skills into web design, but the fact is I just hate it, and wouldn't want that to be my job anyway. Thanks for your input!"

madisonwi,34weyi,new-money,14,Tue May 5 13:55:23 2015 UTC,"Limousines (Limos) may seem like relatively contemporary mode of transport, but in fact they date back to medieval times. During the sieges of reinforced castles, Limos would be brought to the front of the formation where their steel and chrome roofs could shield pikemen from archers. Within the confines of the Limo, attacking troops could approach the castle wall in relative safety. As the Limo approached the castle the LED lighting, alcoholic potions, and (in later periods) mirror balls within the confines of the Limo would serve to rouse the troops, while the tinted out windows and chrome rims intimidated the castle's defenders. Rap music would blared from horns within the vehicle and sometimes from bugles near the rear of the troop formations, to allow the attacking army to coordinate the attack. Once the Limo reached the castle gates, the inebriated attackers would pour from its doors and ""promenade"" into the castle to their deaths, giving the attacking army an opening to advance upon the castle. This final promenade into the castle would often be darkly referred to as ""going to prom"", a term that survives to this day."

Two children playing and one got hurt. Shocking news, I know. I expect that national media will pick it up any minute now. I know the title was taken straight from the article, but seriously OP, you could have changed it. Or you could have not posted this at all, since even for our relatively news-less city, this is not news."
madisonwi,34yl6x,noisette915,7,Tue May 5 18:20:35 2015 UTC,Is this really news? A child was accidentally injured by another child.  The title is also kind of scummy (I know OP didn't write it). Why specify the age of one child and not the other? It makes it seem like the bicyclist is an adult. And where the fuck were the parents?
madisonwi,34yl6x,new-money,-2,Tue May 5 18:07:36 2015 UTC,This all could have been avoided if she was riding in the street.
madisonwi,34yl6x,layer555,1 point,Tue May 5 18:29:58 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you were joking but I would not let my child ride bike on that street. I used to live around there and there is a lot of traffic. I don't know why, it seems so off the main roads but it must be a shortcut to somewhere."
madisonwi,34tl5j,DogofGunther,2,Mon May 4 13:25:32 2015 UTC,"I'm self taught. Lots of people with whom I work are as well. Without professional experience, you need to demonstrate that you can build web applications. Build something related to a hobby of yours. Or find someone who needs a site built and build it as a volunteer or something. The biggest hurdle is you aren't going to get internships or other ways to build your skills.  Languages that can help you get a job are Ruby (focus on the Ruby on Rails framework), Python (learn Django), JavaScript, and PHP. You can also learn Java to get in at more corporate places.   If you really want a challenge pick up Cracking the Coding Interview. This is going to go way beyond most places in Madison, but it is still a great resource.  Also go to Meetups.  http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X"
madisonwi,34tl5j,hrpeanut,1 point,Mon May 4 14:44:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the insight.   How did you or those you work with find that first position from a self taught background? Did it require a connection or networking, or were you able to get interviews normally based on just a portfolio?"
madisonwi,34tl5j,bkv,1 point,Mon May 4 16:08:27 2015 UTC,"Just build out a resume. Get a job, when that job needs programming, do it. Nearly every job you can think of will have the opportunity to automate tasks. That is why Ruby or Python might be a good place to start. Those are generally good as scripting languages."
madisonwi,34tl5j,bkv,2,Mon May 4 16:19:10 2015 UTC,"I have a formal education, but I'll share what I feel is relevant.       What sort of languages are most employable in Madison? Is it a mix of everything, or (due to employers or something else) is there a specific language(s) that learning would set me up best to find a job here?   I personally centered by whole career around C# and .NET.  I didn't get a whole lot of experience with either in college, and learned these during my career post-graduation.  I feel that was a good choice.  There is a ton of demand for C# everywhere, but also in Madison.  About a year and a half ago, I had multiple job offers after the course of about a dozen interviews, and I had a lot of options.   Are there any other technical skills that could be self taught and help me find a job in Madison? Like any worts of technical certifications, or something like R or SQL?   I think a technical certification would really help those without a formal degree.  However, I would argue non-technical skills are the most important when attempting to land an offer.  Some interviews are very technical, some are not; the style of the interview is highly dependent on who is performing it.  But one thing they all have in common is that you're communicating with others.  If you're a very strong introvert that prefers to do sheltered work alone, that might work fine in some organizations, but you're going to have a much harder time getting through an interview.  Communication and interpersonal skills, I feel, should be the highest priority.    On a more technical standpoint, I use the full .NET stack everyday.  Web front-end (like jquery etc) all the way to the backend (like MSSql).  Also windows services, and deployment tools including powershell."
madisonwi,34tl5j,PurpleCapybara,3,Mon May 4 15:39:23 2015 UTC,"Are there any self taught programmers on this sub who have found jobs in the area? If so, would you be willing to post or pm me your story or any advice?   Yep.  Most self-taught programmers start pretty young without any expectation of turning into a career.  It's more just a genuine interest and passion for creating things and solving problems.  Whether or not you'll have success as a self-taught programmer depends on why you're doing it.  Is it because it interests you and you'd find yourself doing it for fun?  Or because it's a good career path and you've heard of other self-taught programmers who were able to get good jobs?  If the latter, you're better off with a 2-year degree at a place like MATC.  If the former, it will still take a couple years to become proficient enough to do it professionally.  You'd also need something to show on a resume in lieu of a degree.   What sort of languages are most employable in Madison? Is it a mix of everything, or (due to employers or something else) is there a specific language(s) that learning would set me up best to find a job here?   I'd recommend C#, although Java is also a big one.  Javascript is essential these days too.   Are there any other technical skills that could be self taught and help me find a job in Madison? Like any worts of technical certifications, or something like R or SQL?   Definitely SQL.  R, not so much."
madisonwi,34tl5j,PurpleCapybara,1 point,Mon May 4 14:43:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the answer.  I probably fall into both those camps - I've been learning off and on for a couple years now based on interest, and am now wondering if I could take it further, as my current job is fine, but doesn't really have any advancement chances or employment prospects with a different company.  Do you think an MATC degree would be enough to get my foot in the door, or in would it be better to go back for a CS bachelor's?"
madisonwi,34tl5j,chisav,2,Mon May 4 16:07:41 2015 UTC,"MATC will arguably get you more marketable skills.  In fact, their curriculum is influenced by the bigger IT shops in the area.  It should be enough to get you a foot in the door somewhere.  Much of the stuff learned getting a CS degree isn't applicable day-to-day unless you plan on getting a job writing compilers, operating systems or other similarly low-level types of things.  The market for these jobs is much smaller and more competitive and would likely require you to relocate."
madisonwi,34tl5j,internet_sage,1 point,Mon May 4 16:20:22 2015 UTC,"Even if it's just a class or a few.  Last time I was in the position to hire a programmer, one was recommended to me by a respected colleague who moved to teaching at MATC, and got the job.  Impress your instructors."
madisonwi,34tl5j,frezik,1 point,Mon May 4 18:41:21 2015 UTC,"Thats a good point, and something I've thought about too.   I realize you may not know this, but do you have any idea of what MATC instructors would think of someone who's taking a class just for that reason?  The reason I'm asking is that I've done a fair amount of learning already, and looking at the syllabuses, a lot of the classes would be very review heavy. Do you think the teachers would be happy to work with a more advanced student in that case?"
madisonwi,34tl5j,YeahILiftBro,1 point,Mon May 4 19:42:45 2015 UTC,"In my own limited teaching experience, I only ever had 1 student who pretty much was able to complete the coursework on the first day.  What I remember most was not that, but that the student wanted to get better and know how his completed assignments could be made more industrial strength. MATC instructors get all kinds of ability, so my gut reaction would be to find classes that look to be of some learning value of you, be upfront with the instructor (I'm not here to learn the basics per se, I'm here to learn how to take them to the next marketable level), and pressure yourself to learn something new by using assignments as a starting point, not an end."
madisonwi,34tl5j,phoenix1984,1 point,Mon May 4 19:53:15 2015 UTC,I'm currently a student in the MATC programming program. You can talk to the instructors about taking the advanced classes based on your current skill and skipping the easier classes.  Also a MATC degree would most certainly be more than enough to get your foot into the door as a developer. CS degree is more about theories rather than the actual coding.  Java and C# are probably the biggest in town. There are a lot of businesses currently hiring Java developers.
madisonwi,34tl5j,phoenix1984,1 point,Tue May 5 19:22:32 2015 UTC,"I'd disagree with R. While it's not going to land you a software developer job, there are tons of jobs that aren't 'programming' jobs but which need a programmer who can do some data analysis. R is not a bad language for that.   If you're self-taught, and without a degree, any previous experience, or projects (open source contributions, e.g.), there are still jobs to be had if you can hack some code and turn data into stats. While a solid C# or java programmer won't add much to their resume with some R experience, someone with no background might benefit.   That said, without learning some stats to go with it, R isn't going to get you much."
madisonwi,34vjfo,PBtrader,4,Mon May 4 22:26:07 2015 UTC,"I thought about them when I was looking for places this Spring. The thing to know about that location is that it is smack in the middle of all the Greek houses. It's going to be loud there, and for that reason I elected not to tour them.

madisonwi,34w3c5,Izira,3,Tue May 5 01:12:48 2015 UTC,"Dog friendly   That's the limiting factor in your search, not having yard access.  Anyways, craigslist/padmapper is the best option."
madisonwi,34w3c5,new-money,1 point,Tue May 5 13:57:31 2015 UTC,"The reason the yard is the concern is that is really the only reason we are looking to move at this point is to have a yard. Our dog would be welcome in most apartments due to her being my ESA, but housing such as duplexes or rented houses aren't covered under the law for her which is why specifically I'll be looking for dog friendly housing. She's not huge or a restricted breed so I have high hopes! Plus, there are a TON of apartment sites if that was a concern, but I have yet to find an apartment with your ""own"" yard area.  Haven't heard of padmapper before, so thank you. :)"
madisonwi,34w3c5,new-money,2,Tue May 5 14:27:19 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. My uncle has a hearing dog and has ran into plenty of housing issues because of it. I know it can be a pain and it's just easier to find dog-friendly apartments rather than jumping through the legal hoops.  Padmapper pulls most of its data from craigslist, so the majority of the results will be the same. I have found some things on padmapper that weren't on craigslist, and vice versa. You can also try Abodo, which is definitely the nicest site but often has old listings and doesn't include nearly as many results as craigslist. Good luck with your search."
madisonwi,34w3c5,triumph110,1 point,Tue May 5 14:36:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Ideally she should also have her canine good citizenship certification before we move and hopefully a good reference from where we live now (especially since she is the only dog allowed here, I would hope that if we can get a good landlord reference from that sort of a situation it may help). I'm hoping between that and the fact that she is my ESA (which again unfortunately doesn't apply to duplexes, but may garner some more understanding) I may be able to work with people who may be on the fence with having a dog on their property.  I wanted to start searching a bit ""early"" in the sense there is no huge rush to move (again, just would prefer a yard, feel it would be easier with a dog compared to our current 2nd floor situation) but wasn't even sure where to start looking besides craigslist. So thank you very much for the suggestions!"

madisonwi,34w3c5,LilyGessert,2,Tue May 5 17:20:16 2015 UTC,I would drive around to look for rental signs in the areas you are interested in. Especially if you are looking in Middleton. Middleton is pricey. A two bedroom duplex under 1500 probably won't be on Craigslist. Good luck dude!
madisonwi,34w3c5,marzeepan,2,Tue May 5 21:55:40 2015 UTC,The Humane society has a listing of pet friendly apartments. You may wish to contact these companies for duplexes/small homes. Good luck I will tell you your rent requirement is putting you out ofthe west side. I found a small house in Crestwood and the landlord laughed when I said 1750 a month for a 2 bed was too much for my blood. He told me I better be prepared to move and really from what I have been seeing he is correct. rents have really increased here in the last 8 months.

madisonwi,34vdqx,ClementineClemency,3,Mon May 4 21:43:24 2015 UTC,"I am currently in the west side of Madison at a T.R. McKenzie property by the name of 'Stone Creek Apartments' (in a Studio Apartment).  I just want to add my personal experience that I have had absolutely zero issues with the lease process and have had no issues with any neighbors around me.  The people who manage this property are fantastic and every maintenance concern is dealt with in a timely manner.    I haven't looked at those other specific T.R. McKenzie properties you mentioned and I also haven't visited Highland Terrace..so please take my opinion lightly, but this company seems very nice and I am absolutely pleased with my choice to live where I do now."
madisonwi,34vdqx,redknight80,1 point,Mon May 4 22:14:46 2015 UTC,"I was pretty impressed with all of the properties, but I'll have to look into Stone Creek as well. What does rent cover there?"
madisonwi,34vdqx,redknight80,2,Tue May 5 16:23:32 2015 UTC,"As the person above mentioned, the rents do tend to be a bit high but I find it totally worth it.  My studio is $780 and I pay for internet and electricity.  Internet runs about $40 a month and electric runs me about $20-$30 on average, only February was high since I ran the heat pretty high and that came to $70.  Underground parking is available but not included in the rent and is $30 a month if you go month by month or $20 a month if you sign up for the parking for a year.    Kind of spendy, but it is below your $1,000 threshold (though if you are looking at a 1 bedroom, it goes up to about $910-$950 per month rent) and this area of town is quite new and Stone Creek is only about 2 years old.  There is a small fitness center here, a pool, tanning booth and you can use BBQ grills near the pool, as well.  Dryer and Washer units are in each unit and that was my main selling point.  Last main thing I can think of that is key is that it is so quiet here..it feels like I don't even have neighbors because I barely hear anything and it is off the main road so I don't hear any traffic nor do I get any lights shining into the place.  Really is a fantastic part of town and there is a bus line nearby..but I haven't used it yet.

madisonwi,34vdqx,IDreamOfRedditing,2,Wed May 6 16:33:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah nothing is too far, unless you work on the East Side..that would be a kind of long drive.  Downtown is only about 15 minutes by car from here (a bit more during rush hour, of course).  There does appear to be openings since I see some signs up that say ""now renting"".  If you need any more information, I can pop over to the main building and ask LeighAnn, she is amazing..or I can reference my lease, if you have any more specific questions.  Keep me updated as you progress and if you do end up living here, I could help you move your belongings in, if you like.    I am currently looking for a full-time Human Resources position so I got loads of free time, at the moment, haha."

There used to be a turtle nest and someone even went to the trouble of putting up a sign about the nest so people wouldn't disturb it. I've also seen snappers over by where the Yahara goes underneath East Wash by Hwy 30 and Wash.  I once saved one who had walked out into the road. I picked him/her up and took them from the middle of the road back over to the grass and water away from the road.  I could not believe how strong the turtle was. I had them firmly grasped by the shell and way behind the front legs. But the turle twisted and extended their neck until they could almost reach my hands.  I'm sure they were more afraid of me than I was of them. But they really are ferociously tough animals. Beautiful too.  EDIT: I'm confusing the turtle nest in the arboretum with the turtle found in Vilas Park. But it isn't that far away so maybe it is the same turtle or turtle family?"

We were told we'd get the clubhouse with the fitness center and pool the same year we leased, and it's still in the works right now. Hopefully it'll actually get done this year. The parking situation is pretty lame for those living in a unit with more than one car. Not enough between the two buildings.   Area is nice though. Decent mix of people. A lot of Indian families so you'll smell a lot of delicious Indian food in the hallways. A lot of the people who live in the area work at American Family or other large companies in the area. The proximity to the growing area by Woodman's is pretty great (Costco, Target, Aldi, etc). Very pet-friendly which could be a pro or con for you. Erin's Snug Pub has a nice environment.

The color doesn't match the new all-black office decor at our new house, however.  So now it can be yours!  I'd rate it as being in good condition, with no tears, rips, or stains.  Any items I'm selling come from a dog and cat household, but I will do my best to clean it via vacuum and lint roller.  It's ridiculously comfortable and free of mechanical defects.  I'm also selling a now-discontinued IKEA Galant corner desk included in the chair link.  Being as it's discontinued, I don't have a manufacturer's link.  I loved this desk while I had it, but it's just too big for my needs.  It has some minor scuffing on the top (shown in the photos) from my desktop tower - it had an exposed metal piece on the bottom and I didn't notice - but in otherwise nice condition.  Also a bit of scuffing along the edges from daily wear and tear.  We will disassemble it.  Finally, I refer you to a craigslist posting here regarding an elliptical I'm also trying to unload.  There are some quirks with it, though, so I'm not going to type it all out.  If you're interested, just refer to that posting.  Please feel free to make offers on any of these things.  I'm willing to entertain nearly any reasonable amount.  However, these items were moved into this house when I still owned a pickup truck and I have since downsized to a smaller vehicle so everything is as is (minus light cleaning) and you haul - we can't/won't deliver anything.  If you have any questions, feel free to comment/shoot me a PM.  Thanks for looking and have a great day!"

A personal experience was when I moved to a poorer area of Madison and I started getting hassled by the police much more compared to when I was living in a wealthy neighborhood. I think it was because I looked poor driving a beater. An example of what I mean by ""hassled"" was when I pulled out of a gas station at night and turned on my lights about 2 seconds after I had pulled out onto East Washington. The police followed me into my neighborhood and eventually pulled me over and asked me to get out of my car and to look inside (which was fine with me but didn't seem relevant to the stop). They let me go without saying much. A few years ago I got a Prius and haven't been bothered since.  I really don't think Madison yuppies actually understand that Madison can be a very different experience if you're poor and black."
madisonwi,34kztj,reimannk,7,Sat May 2 12:25:15 2015 UTC,"Similar stories here. I used to have a 93 Honda and got pulled over ALL the time. I've actually been made to wait for a drug dog, twice. But now I have a squeaky clean 07 Ford and I haven't been pulled over once."
madisonwi,34kztj,layer555,4,Sat May 2 17:30:20 2015 UTC,"Ditto.  I drove a '91 beater Buick for a decade, and though never got pulled over, I got followed regularly by police, especially since I used to cut through a lot of neighborhoods in case my car took a shit on the road (better to leave it on a residential street then the middle of Verona Rd or South Gammon was my thinking.)  Especially when I'd be cutting through ""nicer"" neighborhoods and they obviously felt my presence was suspicious.  I haven't been followed since I got my 2013 model year Kia last year.  People that think that profiling like this doesn't happen regularly are ridiculously naive."

madisonwi,34kztj,Zozur,1 point,Sun May 3 02:34:58 2015 UTC,It just seems that Madison is the wrong city to be advancing this narrative considering our incredibly liberal and diverse police force headed by Chief Koval.   http://www.isthmus.com/news/government/new-chief-mike-koval-wants-madison-police-to-be-a-force-for-good/
madisonwi,34kztj,lamed-vov,26,Sat May 2 06:35:09 2015 UTC,"I would say we are completely the right place, for the same reason."
madisonwi,34kztj,idontownanoutfit,-1,Sat May 2 08:17:05 2015 UTC,"Resolving the issue in Madison would do little to solve any systemic national problem. Most instances of unwarranted police force occur in places where the local police force is corrupt and homogenous. If a racially charged event occurs, the proposal tends to be that the force diversify.   Madison's police force is highly transparent organization that takes great pains to hire inclusively from the people that they will be representing.   Furthermore, the recent death of Tony Robinson, the obvious impetus for this piece, seems to be one of the most straightforward and justifiable uses of police force that have come out of a year marked by police overstep in the country.   The message being advanced is that the Madison police department is targeting minority children while acting as a paramilitary force. Do we have any evidence that this is anything more than a straw man?   What irks me about the events of Tony Robinson's death is that people were protesting in the streets before a single specific detail had emerged. They were vilifying the police for being police, and the event was immediately transformed into a racial issue instead of a fact-finding mission.   I have lived in Madison for years, I attended the University here. I had hoped we were a more mature community than this."
madisonwi,34kztj,lamed-vov,7,Sat May 2 15:17:36 2015 UTC,"out of a year marked by police overstep in the country     Exactly - a year of police overstep. Let's not assume that the shooting of Tony Robinson alone was the impetus for this piece. He specifically said he is speaking out against of trend of unarmed black men (not just Robinson) being killed by police. I really think it's a stretch to assume that the message is that ""Madison PD is targeting minority children [...]"". The artist isn't focusing on Madison, but he does include Madison PD in the conversation. Just because Madison has a diverse police force does not automatically make them immune from police misconduct. Three of the six officers charged in the killing of Freddie Grey were black. Diversification doesn't always solve the problem. Now I am a big fan of the Madison PD and I don't think it's fair to compare them to Baltimore or other PDs, but I'm not going to completely write off the artist's message just because he wants to include Madison in the overall discussion about the issue of killing of unarmed black men by PDs across the country."

madisonwi,34fsr5,name_with_a_y,9,Thu Apr 30 21:13:07 2015 UTC,"It would be very difficult. Originally there was just a large area filled with tables and booths. But they spent a couple of months remodeling the area in order to turn that part of the store into the ""Market Café"". We also hired a few dozen waiters, waitresses, chefs, and managers in order to run the café and changing it back would mean letting those people go. Some shoppers are confused because they are accustomed to getting their food from one part of the store, e.g. Chinese express, Italian express, the deli, etc. and would go to the booths and enjoy their food there, however now they see that there is a restaurant and may be confused. These customers are more than welcome to enjoy their food inside the restaurant, but we are still in a sort of a transitioning stage as you can see by /u/ScottWalkerSucks post. I hope this helped shed some light on the topic, if you have any questions feel free to ask me, or anyone in the store and we would more than happy to help."

It seems like you hired more people for the sake of hiring more people and you want to pay them with tips?  I don't get it.

madisonwi,34fsr5,l3rrr,1 point,Sat May 2 04:07:20 2015 UTC,"The decision came from the higher-ups. Like /u/chetlin said, they tried it out in one Hy-vee and it was a success, so now they are implementing it into all of the Hy-vees. There was nothing wrong with the previous way, they simply tried something new and found people enjoy the restaurants, so they are taking the oportunity and going with it. To address the 2nd part of your comment, they are not ""paid in tips"". I won't say what they make myself but someone else in this thread has already mentioned the base pay rate for servers, if you are curious.   Now it's convoluted, confusing, and takes longer.   I understand that you and many others are unhappy with the change. All of the drinks we offered through the dispenser, we will continue to offer throughout the store. I know we have bottled water, as well as blubbers near both of our restrooms, but if you would prefer a glass, than the cafe is the only option at this point in time. I agree that it could be more user-friendly, but we are still in the transitioning phase with things, and it is something that even the employees are getting accustomed to. I hope you will come to like the café as others do."

I remember one of my favorite BBQ places down south was ruined (well, changed annoyingly) when they changed to full service instead of just get your food and sit down.

The water bill was the funniest part.  It didn't say that it was for water.  It literally said that I paid them $0.75 for $0.75.  Yet I didn't get $0.75 in return.  So confusing.  Can they even charge for a glass of water?

Leaving without leaving a tip does feel strange since it has the whole restaurant experience thing going on, however the waiters know that expecting a tip for water or some other small drink would be silly. It's one of those things that will take many people a while to get used to, myself included. For the time being, we will have to continue being seated in the restaurant, if you are not seated relatively soon, feel free to seat yourself, and when someone comes to help you let them, or a preferably manager know that you were not seated for X amount of time. Thank you for being understanding!"
madisonwi,34fsr5,Zab11,1 point,Fri May 1 00:16:43 2015 UTC,"I agree, a sign would help people, but at the same time, it might encourage the restaurant go'ers not to tip, which would have its own consequences and confusion. Ideally, people will only tip if they received excellent service for an entire meal made by the restaurant, not the deli or salad bar items, and if you do not buy anything from the café, you should not see the whole paper and tip thing in the first place. Also I have heard that their wages are above average for servers, not that that makes much of a difference but just something to note. :)"
madisonwi,34fsr5,l3rrr,4,Fri May 1 00:26:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah my wife and I ate lunch there once when they first opened, the prices looked great but it was really weird and we haven't been back since.    We had our food, we picked a table and sat down and wanted to start eating.  We waited a few minutes for someone to come by and ask us what we'd like to drink...and then she got our diet cokes from the soda machine a few feet away from us.  She was really nice and all...but the idea of tipping someone to put a cup under the soda machine and then bring the check was just dumb."

I don't need to tip when I got the food myself and it's annoying having to wait just for water or a drink.     As of a month ago the Hy Vee in Verona still had a self-seating area where you didn't have to deal with waiters (although they would keep asking you if you wanted to sit in the Market Grille area)"

First of all, you are by no means expected to tip if you got your food from the Deli, that piece of paper your received is just the same one we use for people who get the dining experience. Secondly, the 2 to 3 minute waiting period is usually how long the waiters and waitresses wait for people to decide what they would like to order. If you are already aware that you would like some water or other beverages, please let the person who seats you know so we can send someone over to you right away.

The two Nepalese places on State, Himal Chuli (cash-only) and Chautara, are solid choices, too. Don't know if they still have it, but the last time I was at Chautara, I ordered a braised goat entree that was just killer.  I always used to meet my vegetarian roommate at The Mediterranean Café, home of the best lentil soup in Madison. It's cash-only and open from 10-4(?), so you're not going to be able to grab dinner there. Don't know about whether you can get alcohol there, but I'm going to lean towards not.   Umami Ramen and Dumpling house on Willy Street is another great option. Their ramen is pretty salty but definitely tasty.   Bluephie's on Monroe has a really diverse and delicious menu, too. It's one of my go-to restaurants with family because it's pretty much guaranteed to give everybody something that they'll enjoy."

madisonwi,349wc1,untouchedURL,2,Wed Apr 29 13:38:13 2015 UTC,"As someone who now lives in Michigan, 70 mph roads are wonderful."
madisonwi,349wc1,guitmusic11,6,Thu Apr 30 03:01:54 2015 UTC,I've always wondered why Wisconsin speed limits were so absurdly slow. Maybe now things will get better. Especially the belt line. 55mph is just silly.
madisonwi,349wc1,_stonecoldsaidso,29,Wed Apr 29 13:38:43 2015 UTC,"The beltline will likely not increase because of the density of interchanges and short length of ramps.   It was already legal to move it to 65 and they kept it at 55, so this legislation doesn't really change anything."
madisonwi,349wc1,angrydeuce,11,Wed Apr 29 13:46:59 2015 UTC,"While I doubt highly that the beltline will have its limit raised, I agree, speed limits here are absurdly low.  People think that prevents accidents, but it actually does the opposite...there's a reason why states like Michigan use the 85th percentile speed as a guideline for pegging speed limits.  When limits are too low, it causes people to drive more aggressively to get around those that are driving at the speed limit.  The cops aren't going to waste resources going after people doing 5-10 over, and most people are going 5-10 over regardless of the posted limit, so one has to wonder what the rationale is for pegging a roadway at such a low speed.  If the speed limit on the interstate were raised to 90, people wouldn't suddenly start driving 10mph or more.  Drive in any of those states that have 80+ limits and you'll find most people cruise at 70-75 anyway.  It doesn't actually effect anything other than people being less spastic looking for cops and slamming brakes on worried about tickets."
madisonwi,349wc1,ScottWalkerSucks,9,Wed Apr 29 15:07:49 2015 UTC,"Also, when Montana removed it's speed limits completely (during the day) people were speeding/hauling ass at an unprecedented rate.  All the nay sayers were claiming that it would increase the deaths per year, but in fact it did the opposite:  The safest year ever, with the fewest deaths.   Why?  People were driving at their abilities, and paying attention."
madisonwi,349wc1,owlboy,0,Wed Apr 29 17:20:04 2015 UTC,"Wait, higher speeds help you drive at your ability, (that seems intrinsic no matter the speed limit, your ability that is.)  And it helped them pay attention?"
madisonwi,349wc1,ScottWalkerSucks,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:55:43 2015 UTC,"Most speed limits are set way too low, so people are really fucking bored on the freeways.  This means their mind starts wandering and they find other things to do (reading, watching movies, texting, checking facebook, etc)."
madisonwi,349wc1,belandil,8,Thu Apr 30 14:27:18 2015 UTC,"They're not going to raise the speed limit on the beltline.  There are too many entrances and exits.  As it stands before the passage of this bill, the beltline could be 65 mph.  The only places that might have a higher speed limit will be where the speed limit is already 65 mph."

madisonwi,34cdn6,filolif,1 point,Thu Apr 30 02:03:35 2015 UTC,"Hey I do some sort of pick up / league volleyball in Madison two to four days a week depending on the season and am familiar with the madison volleyball scene.   What skill level are you? What kinda commitment are you looking for?   Think: I played in gym class years ago, but I remember it was fun (beginner), I played in high school / play occasionally and can consistantly get a bump set spike (intermediate) or I'm a beast and I can run plays, block, aggressively serve, and play seriously (power).   There are a ton of free, low skill level groups during the summer for sand volleyball. There are a few indoor groups for all skill levels round year, but are more populated during the winter months. There are a ton of leagues for all skill levels of course, but prices and quality varies quite a lot. Plus, location to you is a big factor if you have to be there any time around rush hour.   I personally play in a few different leagues for different reasons. Anyway, pm or reply and I'll set you up with something."

madisonwi,34acq6,thebookpolice,3,Wed Apr 29 15:49:17 2015 UTC,"Given the length that you are talking about, a buried line could be a problem in the winter if your sump pump is active.  And since you say it is pumping enough water to make a green spot on your lawn each spring, it sounds like it is.  Any water sitting in that line in the winter would freeze and obstruct the line.  Giving the line the right pitch to drain out would help, but if you need 30 feet of line, you wouldn't be able to give the line much pitch unless the rain garden was already downhill.  You could bury one line and then swap it out in the winter with one on the surface.  If you switched over to the buried line shortly after the risk of freezing ended but before the grass started growing, that should eliminate or at least reduce the green spot in the lawn."
madisonwi,34acq6,tmntman,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:32:58 2015 UTC,you wouldn't be able to give the line much pitch unless the rain garden was already downhill   It is. Probably drops about a foot from foundation to property line. Maybe more. It's a nicely crowned lot.
madisonwi,34acq6,tmntman,2,Wed Apr 29 17:45:35 2015 UTC,"The only way for that drain line to remain usable in the winter is to either be below the frost line, which would be too deep to do the rain garden any good, or to fully drain after each use.  One or two feet of drop over thirty feet may be enough.  But you would have to make sure that the end at the rain garden was the lowest point and that the water still had someplace to run to after leaving the hose.  If any of it ran back into the hose and froze, your sump pump would no longer be able to operate until it thawed."
madisonwi,34acq6,n609mike,5,Wed Apr 29 18:19:38 2015 UTC,Why dont you bury a plastic lined gravel trench to your rain garden? You could make it so you only see gravel right at the discharge point and next to or at the rain garden.
madisonwi,34acq6,LongUsername,3,Wed Apr 29 18:27:14 2015 UTC,"Badger Basement (AKA Basement Systems) uses what they call an ""Ice Guard"".  You can pretty much replicate it by burying a 4"" PVC pipe and then discharging your 1.5-2"" sump pump line into it, and cutting some slots in the 4"" pipe below the adapter for the overflow.  EDIT: Here's another companies version that shows you pretty clearly how to make one yourself."
madisonwi,34acq6,n609mike,2,Wed Apr 29 18:40:00 2015 UTC,That seems like too much water too close to the foundation.
madisonwi,34acq6,LongUsername,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:46:49 2015 UTC,"You choices are have that near the foundation, or overflowing your sump crock in the basement (best case) or a broken pump line spraying water across your basement (worst case).  If it's cold enough that the line completely freezes the majority of that water pouring out will freeze near the surface."
madisonwi,34acq6,n609mike,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:09:57 2015 UTC,An open trough would would work too. Once the water thaws that close to the foundation you will be pumping it out again.
madisonwi,34acq6,tmntman,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:13:21 2015 UTC,"Hopefully the only time this is used would be if the pipe underground had frozen.  If that is the case, the surface is probably frozen too and if there is proper slope to the ground, it will run off away from the house."

madisonwi,348wto,AbbaZabaMyOnlyFriend,7,Wed Apr 29 14:11:22 2015 UTC,damn echo is charging $25 to get in
madisonwi,348wto,ericj4,6,Wed Apr 29 13:30:09 2015 UTC,I read its around $1400 for a bar to show it. Way better to just get a bunch of people over to share at someones house.
madisonwi,348wto,n609mike,2,Wed Apr 29 13:40:42 2015 UTC,I read that some UFC fights or other boxing matches sell for 1500-3000 for a commercial license so I'd imagine this one would be even higher.  There's also the problem of the fight being the same day as Mifflin which I imagine would probably discourage bars from wanting to show the fight.
madisonwi,348wto,n609mike,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:53:54 2015 UTC,Either way I cant see them making a ton at $25 per person. I don't think the fight will be as good as the hype.
madisonwi,348wto,new-money,2,Wed Apr 29 14:03:46 2015 UTC,But the hype is all they need to make money... it doesn't actually matter how good the fight is. They only need 56 customers @$25 cover to break even on the $1400. And they will probably sell more drinks as well.
madisonwi,348wto,The_Drizzle_Returns,0,Wed Apr 29 14:45:36 2015 UTC,ESPN reported that the cost of this fight to bar owners is $25 * the fire occupancy limit of the building. So they need to pack the place (to the literal legal limit) to cover the cost of the event.
madisonwi,348wto,millionsofmonkeys,2,Fri May 1 05:02:25 2015 UTC,no because booze
madisonwi,348wto,The_Drizzle_Returns,1 point,Fri May 1 05:04:11 2015 UTC,Depends on how long the fight is and how many drinks people buy and how close they get to the fire occupancy limit not the number of seats.
madisonwi,348wto,jgam7,2,Fri May 1 05:21:16 2015 UTC,"I manage a bar downtown. DirecTV tried to sell the fight to our owner. From what I understand, cost depends on the bar capacity (and number of screens I believe) and would have cost us upwards of $1500."

madisonwi,348wto,wackywiener,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:47:28 2015 UTC,Same. I would guess Brats has it for free as well.
madisonwi,348wto,thunderbuttt,2,Wed Apr 29 16:50:34 2015 UTC,Both BWW and Brats are not showing. It's almost 10 grand for a bar to show the fight according to my roommate who is a manager at Brats.
madisonwi,348wto,wackywiener,2,Thu Apr 30 09:04:09 2015 UTC,Interesting. It's not ten grand for every bar though:   ESPN’s Darren Rovell reported the cost for this bout is $25 multiplied by the fire code occupancy of the location.   http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/apr/28/floyd-mayweather-manny-pacquiao-fight-pay-per-view-cops  Still a rip off and bullshit they charge for occupancy. I can't believe BWW isn't getting it. That's their thing...

madisonwi,34611b,madtownWI,28,Tue Apr 28 16:09:17 2015 UTC,"It's very funny living in Denver now and seeing people from Madison complain about rent. When I lived in Madison a few years ago I rented a bedroom in a 2-bedroom flat for $410 a month. I'd be lucky to get a cardboard box for that here.  As for the homeless using the shelters, I used to work with them in Madison and what I've found is that the majority fall into two categories:   People with mental disorders or drug addictions preventing them from becoming functioning members of society. People who prefer to be homeless rather than deal with having a job/rent/other responsibilities.   The homeless who actually utilized the services (like Porchlight) available to them actually did quite well (exceptions for any that fall into the above categories).  I think one difficult thing with this problem is that we think we can have the same solution for all homeless, but the truth is that you need separate approaches for those who can't get themselves out of their situation vs. those who choose to be homeless.  Either way this is something that needs to be addressed. Denver had a similar increase in homeless as the city increased services for them, and more recently with the legalization of canibus. It has become a huge issue for the city, and many of the downtown areas have become unsafe to be in at night. I could easily see Madison going the same way.  I like that Soglin is trying to deal with this, but I don't think he is taking the correct approach. Instead of trying to step up restrictions on the homeless, why not learn from other successful programs where cities gave homeless free permanent housing? So far these programs have shown to be extremely effective, and actually cheaper in the long run for the city."
madisonwi,34611b,yetismack,8,Tue Apr 28 18:23:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for linking to the permanent supportive housing programs - they work, and have been shown to work socially, economically, and medically.  Overall this is a really well-framed response!"
madisonwi,34611b,yetismack,4,Tue Apr 28 18:38:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but it still doesn't fix the issue of homeless who refuse free permanent housing (like Soglin mentions in the original article). This just baffles me so completely that I can't even begin to think of how to deal with it. If someone chooses that lifestyle, what the hell can we do about it?"
madisonwi,34611b,yetismack,7,Tue Apr 28 18:47:39 2015 UTC,"Right, this is really tough.  It's such a small group, however, that I find it annoying that Paul is constructing a bit of a 'Straw Homeless Population' out of these people to attack.  If we truly need a solution to this group's issue (an eventuality I hope for), it probably comes in the form of some time-based conversion of benefits to an incentivized structure, such as job-search and housing-search related."
madisonwi,34611b,deadcelebrities,3,Tue Apr 28 19:00:11 2015 UTC,"Based off my personal observations, I don't think those who choose to be homeless is an insignificant portion of our homeless population, but you are correct that they are much easier to attack.  I'd really like to see some solid investigation into the reasons they become/remain homeless. I think that is really the first step in finding a solution.  Treat the cause, not the symptoms and all that."
madisonwi,34611b,idontownanoutfit,2,Tue Apr 28 20:16:10 2015 UTC,"That would be really awesome - unfortunately, it IS notoriously difficult to get funding for those kinds of studies.  My suspicion, however, is the main reason is because there is a certain population that can be supported by efficient and targeted panhandling, and some at least have probably perfected this."
madisonwi,34611b,v-porphyria,5,Tue Apr 28 20:27:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've always wondered what would happen if everyone stopped giving panhandlers money. If they didn't have money to buy booze/drugs would some decide that they don't want to be homeless anymore?"
madisonwi,34611b,Mhm426,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:03:27 2015 UTC,Try asking them for money. Blows their mind.

madisonwi,34611b,Mhm426,1 point,Wed Apr 29 20:43:07 2015 UTC,"Yes.   One time I was convincing enough that this guy actually gave the money that my friend had just given him, back to her.   They know that they are playing on peoples' pity and they are good at it. If you don't let it get to that level, they'll be real with you. Or spit on you."
madisonwi,34611b,layer555,8,Wed Apr 29 20:50:09 2015 UTC,"When I lived in Madison a few years ago I rented a bedroom in a 2-bedroom flat for $410 a month. I'd be lucky to get a cardboard box for that here.   So that's $820 a month with another roommate. Plus a first and last months rent for security deposit. Add on top of that a credit check, rental history and background check. Rental application for $50-$100 dollars. Also, we have no vacancies here. The land that Madison sits on is limited by the lakes. Denver has vacancies and room to grow.   Also correlating legalized weed and public safety is utter bullcrap. No one is mugging anyone for a joint. Sorry, just don't believe it. I can make a dozen assumptions that hold more weight than that.   Yes, Madison needs to do something about the homeless issue. I just can't agree with your comparisons. Especially when one of those cities has 2.6 million people in the greater metro area."
madisonwi,34611b,suzy6,5,Tue Apr 28 21:39:52 2015 UTC,"My point with the rent was just that it's interesting to see people complain about how high prices are when I long for the days when I was renting in the Madison market.  You made an assumption saying that I correlate legalizing recreational canibus and a decrease in public safety. The correlation I was making was that having legal weed brought more homeless to our city. I see how that could be confusing and in hindsight it didn't really contribute to my point and just helped to obfuscate things. I was trying to explain that Denver recently saw a homeless boom like Madison is seeing now, and hoping that Madison can do something about it before it becomes the major issue it has become for us."
madisonwi,34611b,noisette915,1 point,Tue Apr 28 22:02:49 2015 UTC,"As someone who lives in both Madison and Denver, and splits my time throughout the year in both places, I can say that all the new bums that came to downtown Denver after legalization suck. Sometimes they smell so bad and are so obnoxious that it gives me a twinge of guilt for voting for legalization.  I still would vote for legalization, but I've seen with my own eyes the influx of losers that came with legal cannabis.   Madison is a lovely city, and I would hate to see the same sort of influx here as it grows.  Soglin has said he supports 'housing first' initiatives which are backed by data as working. I think that Madison needs to start acting like a big city with its policies regarding the homeless."
madisonwi,34611b,ScottWalkerSucks,8,Thu Apr 30 01:13:00 2015 UTC,"I was not aware the needles were being found, that really is a problem. So why aren't police patrolling these areas to keep the possibility of this down, or are they??? I walk by the top of state street daily because I live around there and there always seems to be a cop car parked around there. Either they are actually monitoring that area and the public library, or they really really like Ian's Pizza.  Making up limits to the use of benches will further enforce stereotypes and run tensions higher. They will clearly only talk to people who ""look homeless"" rather than anyone who happens to be sitting on a bench reading. I don't really think that's necessary.   I will also just say that it baffles me if Soglin is really saying these people would rather not be sleeping on beds and prefer the streets. I don't know what the housing rules are at the places where these people have been kicked out of but it seems a little bit off."
madisonwi,34611b,madman86,4,Tue Apr 28 17:02:26 2015 UTC,"Typically shelters have caps on the amount of days you can stay there, and most Madison shelters also have requirements about staying clean, which is often near-impossible for the many homeless people dealing with mental illness in Madison."
madisonwi,34611b,suzy6,8,Tue Apr 28 18:27:33 2015 UTC,It seems pretty obnoxious that we clearly know that mental illness is the biggest issue here yet we are just wasting time and resources targeting the homeless population's actions instead of the actual problem. I have no idea what would go in to figuring it out but I don't know why it isn't being acknowledged first and foremost as the main goal of the city. It's like killing ants you find inside your house and you keep complaining about having to kill them when you never try to address the source of how they're getting in. (or something...)
madisonwi,34611b,TuckerGrover,3,Tue Apr 28 18:48:09 2015 UTC,homeless people dealing with mental illness   Bingo
madisonwi,34611b,suzy6,9,Tue Apr 28 19:51:32 2015 UTC,Previous article for context:  Paul Soglin takes actions on drifters and the homeless engaged in dangerous behaviors
madisonwi,34611b,TuckerGrover,20,Tue Apr 28 16:10:06 2015 UTC,"Irving Smith said he is a homeless veteran who can’t afford rent in the Williamson Street area, which requires the equivalent of making $20 an hour.   False. It took me three seconds to find a very nice $525/month Studio apartment, and there are much much cheaper options available by renting a room in a shared apartment in a different neighborhood.  A full-time minimum wage ($7.25/h) employee brings home around $1,000/mo after tax. Considering this person would most likely be eligible for food stamps, along with other services, this is a livable wage for an individual. It might not be a luxurious lifestyle, but it is far from homeless.  The problem is that most homeless people are unemployed. I think the bigger issue is the lack of work opportunities, not housing costs.   UW-Madison graduate student Carl Lemke Oliver Sack said his family is struggling to afford a place to live, although he and his wife both work.  “The city is becoming more unaffordable to students and others on restricted incomes,” he said. “We’re operating for the benefit of private for-profit developers and criminalizing our homeless neighbors.”   Livability complaints from the middle class are bullshit. I'm sure this guy and his wife are experiencing some real hardship as a double income family with two cars, eating at restaurants, and buying new clothes. Also, Madison has an abundance of luxury income-restricted apartments in great locations that are certainly affordable for a couple who can share a 1 bedroom. Sometimes I'm envious of the people who qualify for places like The Madison Mark."
madisonwi,34611b,suzy6,19,Tue Apr 28 16:55:18 2015 UTC,"I'm beyond tired of having articles about how people ""can't afford to live in Madison."" Bullshit. What you mean is people can't afford to live downtown. Well, that sucks, but that's the way it works. You aren't entitled to live downtown. There's all sorts of options east, south, north, and west that aren't any more expensive than any other similar city. The fact that this isn't a university town anymore, but real, growing city with a growing economy is a good thing."
madisonwi,34611b,TuckerGrover,-12,Tue Apr 28 18:30:44 2015 UTC,"And those places are all fucking boring, beige, and there is nothing to do and people go to bed at 9pm.  Fuck the suburbs.  Fuck Madison."
madisonwi,34611b,suzy6,4,Wed Apr 29 16:06:54 2015 UTC,"+1 to the first half. I'm not sure what world this guy is living in that you need to be making $20/hr to live in Madison. I would venture a guess that a good portion of the population does not make anywhere near that.   As far as the grad-student, I hear his pain, but that is part of personal responsibility. You have to know what you can/can't afford, and what that will mean for you/your family. If you're not willing or unable, then you need to find an alternate plan that will work."
madisonwi,34611b,idontownanoutfit,-1,Tue Apr 28 17:21:26 2015 UTC,"Precisely. And recent grads should expect to live on the cheap -- they made the choice to delay entering the workforce, and likely racked up quite a bit of debt to go with it. Hopefully that translates into higher income, but it will take a while to dig out of the hole."
madisonwi,34611b,suzy6,9,Tue Apr 28 17:25:28 2015 UTC,You're assuming the landlord is willing to rent to that person. Low vacancy rate makes it very easy for landlords to choose their occupants.
madisonwi,34611b,idontownanoutfit,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:14:26 2015 UTC,"True, although there are laws against renting discrimination. Issues mostly arise for people who have poor background/credit/renter's history, and in that case I would suggest looking at renting a bedroom in a shared apartment to cut costs and gain references."
madisonwi,34611b,suzy6,5,Tue Apr 28 17:21:21 2015 UTC,It still isn't that simple. Two bad rental histories sharing a bedroom doesn't cancel itself out.

madisonwi,34611b,n609mike,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:58:18 2015 UTC,"I suspect many of those folks don't have a security deposit + first month's rent saved up. That's the first barrier, and you shouldn't expect landlords to approve anyone who can't meet that requirement."

madisonwi,34611b,suzy6,13,Tue Apr 28 20:17:12 2015 UTC,"Considering this person would most likely be eligible for food stamps, along with other services, this is a livable wage for an individual. It might not be a luxurious lifestyle, but it is far from homeless.   $7.25 an hour isn't a livable wage if you have to live off foodstamps. I can't believe this has to be said."

I would also argue that it's a livable wage even if you're not on food stamps, albeit much more difficult.  (I know that the defined ""living wage"" in Madison is $12, but again, we're talking about the extreme end of poverty)"
madisonwi,34611b,RonaldoNazario,6,Tue Apr 28 21:46:26 2015 UTC,"The extreme end of poverty has very little to do with minimum wage and more to do with mental health issues and drug addiction.   Living off of government subsidies to feed yourself doesn't contribute to this conversation much either. I am as liberal as they come, but a normal living shouldn't mean living off food stamps."
madisonwi,34611b,theoryface,1 point,Tue Apr 28 22:34:55 2015 UTC,"I agree, except government subsidies certainly do contribute to this conversation considering 99% of homeless people are eligible for some type of assistance."

madisonwi,34611b,suzy6,3,Tue Apr 28 17:16:58 2015 UTC,"Stonehouse Development is responsible for most of Madison's income restricted apartment complexes, and you can see they have even more locations than the ones you and I already mentioned."
madisonwi,34611b,RonaldoNazario,6,Tue Apr 28 17:22:47 2015 UTC,"They are some of the pickiest landlords. There is a waiting list for most, if not all, of their buildings. That is part of their business plan. Homeless folks are not likely to get in to those buildings."

madisonwi,34611b,ApatheticEmployee,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:44:32 2015 UTC,My point is that they don't take homeless or on the fringe of homeless type people.
madisonwi,34611b,TuckerGrover,0,Tue Apr 28 18:03:20 2015 UTC,"I get that.   It is tough to establish a good rental history. I can tell you that post evictions or ongoing rental disputes with previous landlords are always a red flag in tenant screening. However, if you don't owe you landlord any money/didn't trash the place, and the eviction is far enough in the past, you should have a good shot at getting in a decent place.   Another piece of advice is being upfront about your rental history so you don't get your hopes up on a place or waste your time with an application that has will be auto-denied because of an eviction."
madisonwi,34611b,TuckerGrover,2,Tue Apr 28 18:11:18 2015 UTC,"Eh, not always.  Being honest and trying to emphasize the good aspects of your rental history can always help (it's your only hope, actually).  But because the vacancy rate in Madison is so extremely low, landlords can be as picky as they want to be and they'll almost never have to worry about not being able to fill their unit.  If you have poor credit and/or a poor rental history, it's still extremely difficult to find housing, and often times the only landlords willing to rent to you are predatory slumlords."
madisonwi,34611b,yetismack,-4,Mon May 4 06:02:05 2015 UTC,"Well, they aren't for homeless people. They are still expensive apartments by my standards, but they are a great way for low-income couples to tap into a luxurious lifestyle they wouldn't normally be able to afford."

Just to clarify, the ""ENTIRE"" building need not be sec. 42.   Buildings can be split (usually to) 50-50 or 60-40 market rate/sec. 42 units."

madisonwi,34611b,n609mike,0,Tue Apr 28 18:18:05 2015 UTC,It was just an example for a working individual with low income. Two part-time minimum wage jobs is certainly a thing.
madisonwi,34611b,ktourdot,3,Tue Apr 28 17:19:39 2015 UTC,"I dont disagree with your overall point, just have often heard finding a min wage job at 40hrs is unlikely.  As you point out, could be 2 20hr jobs.  That does mean that they'd be benefit less other than whatever aid they qualify for"
madisonwi,34611b,TuckerGrover,3,Tue Apr 28 18:19:13 2015 UTC,Does the city county building even have enough room for all these people? What does the city plan on doing to replace what they had before?
madisonwi,34611b,n609mike,3,Tue Apr 28 16:54:58 2015 UTC,"Another important aspect to consider is the fact that any sane landlord will do anything they can to prevent homeless or destitute people from renting from them. Why risk renting to someone who may not be able to pay, or worse, may damage the building, when you could rent to a college kid? Surely it would be easier to collect on a judgement against a college kid than from someone with nothing to take."
madisonwi,34611b,sassafrass14,12,Wed Apr 29 07:04:40 2015 UTC,I'm stunned that city employees and anyone who has business with the city are forced to walk through this gauntlet day after day. this has potential to be a real threat to public safety and downtown commerce.
madisonwi,34611b,yetismack,7,Tue Apr 28 16:47:44 2015 UTC,"Shelters don't ascribe to harm reduction methods, which means people that are using cannot be sheltered indoors. Furthermore, the shelters have a limit on days per year that someone may choose to shelter. Many, many variables at play here."
madisonwi,34611b,n609mike,3,Tue Apr 28 17:11:06 2015 UTC,"people that are using cannot be sheltered indoors. Furthermore, the shelters have a limit on days per year that someone may choose to shelter.    Sounds like the shelters are geared more towards someone who hits hard times and needs a safe place to stay for a while while they get back on their feet, as apposed to a chronic homeless person who may be an addict or suffer from mental problems."
madisonwi,34611b,n609mike,6,Tue Apr 28 17:22:46 2015 UTC,"I fear you're oversimplifying the issue here. Homelessness, like anything else, has the ability to be complex. The Mayor has signed an initiative to end Veteran and chronic homelessness by the end of 2015 and 2016, respectively. I hope his current intentions still are aligned to that original goal."
madisonwi,34611b,yetismack,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:30:42 2015 UTC,"What am I oversimplifying by noting who the shelters are intended to cater to?

On Tuesday, more than six hypodermic needles were found in the grassy area alongside The Towers. On Wednesday the area was littered with food and other debris. On several occasions clothing was littering the area, including feces-laden pants.   Doesn't sound particularly safe to me."

madisonwi,34611b,yetismack,9,Tue Apr 28 18:31:15 2015 UTC,We have different standards for what people do in their private residences than what they do in public spaces.
madisonwi,34611b,yetismack,-8,Tue Apr 28 18:43:30 2015 UTC,... Have you seen the public spaces around that area dude?
madisonwi,34611b,yetismack,14,Tue Apr 28 18:44:24 2015 UTC,Yes. College students can be messy as hell. I remember having to step around my fair share of puke going to class Monday morning. That's annoying and a waste of Ian's pizza. However in the 25 years I lived in Madison I never saw college students leave piles of used needles in areas commonly frequented by small children. That's on a whole other level of danger.
madisonwi,34611b,voteferpedro,-6,Tue Apr 28 18:54:20 2015 UTC,6 and piles are perhaps different Fermi numbers here.  Do you count people shooting up?  Because I've seen that on Fahrenbrook myself.
madisonwi,34611b,MSACCESS4EVA,4,Tue Apr 28 18:57:37 2015 UTC,Pile: an assemblage of things laid or lying one upon the other  I'm not sure I'm getting your point. If students are using IV drugs in a public space should they be arrested? Yes. Of course. Unless things have really changed in the few months I've been gone I'm pretty sure that's what would happen if an officer witnessed that.
madisonwi,34611b,diewild,-4,Tue Apr 28 19:05:08 2015 UTC,"Piles to me implies many more than 6.  If that wasn't your intent, apologies.  And.... yeah.  Students do that shit now.  I'm sorry if your version of Madison is different than the current one, but in my eyes it's hypocritical to demonize the homeless for something that goes on blocks away in similarly public places."
madisonwi,34611b,yetismack,7,Tue Apr 28 19:08:10 2015 UTC,"I would say the gauntlet includes but isn't limited to:   the heaps of trash bags and whatnot the smell pan-handling fights  inebriated and sometimes agitated & inebriated people,  drug addicts needles & other paraphernalia  cat-calls"
madisonwi,34611b,noisette915,9,Tue Apr 28 17:12:15 2015 UTC,"I have walked State Street since 1991. I have not ONCE come across a needle, a fight, or cat calls. I do, however, REGULARLY see inebriated, agitated people. Those are the well dressed, poorly behaving college students. I have also seen these same drunk students pee on buildings,in the stairwell of parking ramps, etc.. If people feel threatened, scared walking passed the clear picture of huge social issue, economic issue, and call it a ""gauntlet"". I would suggest they get over themselves."
madisonwi,34611b,sewellcm,2,Tue Apr 28 21:02:33 2015 UTC,"You'd safer to walk in and out of that building any time of day, than you are to be anywhere around State/University past 10pm Thursday-Saturday.    The real issue here is that people are made uncomfortable by poverty and homelessness and would rather just make them invisible than dealing with it.  I spend plenty of time in that area and haven't witnessed half of what you're describing.  The majority of the time no one will bother you, except maybe to ask for money.  (edit - Originally written as a reply to someone else, edited out the first part to actually make sense)"
madisonwi,34611b,layer555,2,Mon May 4 06:06:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, none of that is really very dangerous to the public.    The lives of the homeless people, many of whom are dealing with untreated or often even undiagnosed mental illness are MUCH more important to me.    If those things bother you, or bother the people that live and work here in this city, might I suggest not voting for politicians that pull shit like this to make the lives of these people even harder?"
madisonwi,34611b,MSACCESS4EVA,15,Tue Apr 28 17:20:26 2015 UTC,"The mayor's argument is that Madison is the only city in WI even allowing homeless mentally handicap people much less actually helping them so Madison attracts them. And that we can not afford to pay for the entire state's mental illness treatment service. We don't even have enough service providers, much less the money to pay for them."
madisonwi,34611b,layer555,5,Tue Apr 28 17:33:46 2015 UTC,"Madison is perceived as having more resources for social services, including helping the homeless/transient population and those with developmental disabilities.  As a result, the city, county, and other interested groups end up serving the needs of people from Madison in addition to those from outside Madison.  There's an adult male who has some type of developmental disability who rides my bus in the morning and has stated in conversation that he grew up in Mazomanie but was sent to Madison as an adult.  There's also the case of Ludell Swenson.  Both came from small towns that don't want to spend money on helping their less fortunate residents.  Instead, it's easier for them to send them to Madison where there's more support for them."
madisonwi,34611b,layer555,3,Tue Apr 28 18:26:21 2015 UTC,"This is an argument that I think is correct. I don't love some of your word choices, but am thinking this is the motivating factor behind the Mayor making this statement."
madisonwi,34611b,chriswalkeninmemphis,6,Tue Apr 28 17:42:13 2015 UTC,Changing words to PC words don't change the facts. The reality is 90% of homelessness is something in their brain(mentally) is causing them some serious problems (handicap). I would include drugs.
madisonwi,34611b,belandil,1 point,Tue Apr 28 18:18:43 2015 UTC,"Yep. And the ""out of sight, out of mind"" mentality of the city, county and state is where most of the burden lies in looking for a solution to clean house."
madisonwi,34611b,Mswindupbird89,3,Tue Apr 28 21:07:05 2015 UTC,"That's simply untrue.  Milwaukee also has large problems, but in a lot of ways almost actively ignores them.  Of course, Madison and Milwaukee are really operating on a different scale and a really different environment than the rest of the state - this can be seen by the operation of their own homelessness operations, whereas the other parts of the state are chopped up into oversight units of sorts.  It's been shown with data-driven approaches that proactively helping these intensive users of services costs MUCH less than the policies we use in Madison, so yes, we probably can't solve the state's homelessness problem from City Hall, we CAN do a hell of a lot better with the resources we have on hand."
madisonwi,34611b,ScottWalkerSucks,3,Tue Apr 28 17:49:05 2015 UTC,Are you implying that we dont have benefits so much better than anywhere else that we do not attract homeless or near homeless people? People really do get literally shipped her from other cities. The mayor has shown cities buying people bus tickets to Madison. That is fucked up.

The kicker was that even after I explained the traffic circle, he refused to acknowledge any wrong doing on his part.  Driving is a privilege, not a right.  I'm sorry if that's rude.

In general I think you'll always see either the right lane must turn right or the left lane must continue straight. There shouldn't be any crossings in the roundabout, just lane changes."
madisonwi,348gfd,steve77atwork,2,Wed Apr 29 16:13:09 2015 UTC,yield to both lanes when entering I guess and leave considerable room   This is always the safest approach.
madisonwi,348gfd,layer555,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:46:56 2015 UTC,"http://dot.wi.gov/safety/motorist/roaddesign/roundabouts/docs/br-alwaysyield.pdf  If you are not making an immediate right, but going straight or around 3/4 of the circle, you go in the left lane and exit to the right from the left lane.  So you were like the big yellow crashy-thing in the graphic.  So you are now correct, you must yield to both lanes because they could both be exiting the circle."
madisonwi,348gfd,MSACCESS4EVA,-4,Wed Apr 29 19:01:05 2015 UTC,It's safe because anyone in the outer lane is supposed to use the next exit.
madisonwi,348gfd,steve77atwork,4,Wed Apr 29 08:49:16 2015 UTC,Not always.
madisonwi,348gfd,RandomPrecision1,2,Wed Apr 29 14:06:37 2015 UTC,The problem lies in the fact that sometimes the inside lane can also use that exit so people will enter the circle thinking that the inside lane is going to follow the circle.
madisonwi,348gfd,WIInvestigator,-2,Wed Apr 29 18:49:36 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why some of the roundabouts on the west side are two lanes, when all the roads that feed into them are one lane each way.  Don't people get confused enough on single-lane roundabouts?"
madisonwi,348gfd,RandomPrecision1,3,Wed Apr 29 03:39:37 2015 UTC,The reason behind this is if you're making an immediate right you'll enter the outside lane. If you're going straight or left you'll proceed using the inside lane.
madisonwi,348gfd,WIInvestigator,4,Wed Apr 29 04:19:06 2015 UTC,"There's at least one roundabout over there that does this kind of effectively by having a ""bypass"" road.  There are three roads converging, and if you want the closest one, you can more or less skip the actual roundabout.  But then also in the roundabout, there are two lanes.  I just think it'd just be simpler as a one-lane roundabout with bypasses.  As a bonus, it'd cut the signage in half, which I think overwhelms a lot of folks that aren't familiar with the roads."
madisonwi,348gfd,steve77atwork,2,Wed Apr 29 05:29:42 2015 UTC,I think that many folks struggle with the roundabout at Mineral Point Rd. and Pleasant View Rd.
madisonwi,348gfd,RandomPrecision1,2,Wed Apr 29 12:34:17 2015 UTC,"yes, at this circle nobody seems to realize that the inside lane can go straight."
madisonwi,348gfd,TigerB65,2,Wed Apr 29 18:48:27 2015 UTC,"Indeed - it was recently the #4 most accident-prone intersection in the area, apparently.  The roundabout just south of it was #10. 2014 link  In 2012 when the west-side roundabouts were new, they were at #5 and #3, respectively. 2012 link"

It's basically a nature preserve that wraps around most of Lake Wingra, with some walking paths in it. That would put you in the Vilas neighborhood, which also has decent access to the multi-use paths (aka bike paths).   Vilas is a residential mix of residents, college students, folks who work at the hospitals nearby, etc. There's a good balance between affordability and safety, although I wouldn't call rent ""cheap"" there. The places with cheap rent you don't want to live in. For a general discussion of neighborhoods without the nature/bike commuting angle, just check the FAQ.

madisonwi,341per,_dicktator,3,Mon Apr 27 19:47:21 2015 UTC,The beltline is one of the most policed roads in town. They sit in the median where there are turnaround spots. They also just drive on the beltline because they know there is a guaranteed speeding ticket waiting for them.
madisonwi,341per,angrydeuce,2,Mon Apr 27 20:48:18 2015 UTC,I believe you but honestly in 4 years of driving over the speed limit on the beltline I've seen like 1-2 cops. Granted I haven't had to drive very far. Hence my general disbelief of cop presence and my original question. Thanks for the response.
madisonwi,341per,new-money,3,Mon Apr 27 20:51:27 2015 UTC,"General rule of thumb: cops know where people are likely to speed, so that's where they'll get ya.  The beltline is a highway, and the fastest way through town, but the speed limit is only 55. Everyone goes at least 65, so they tend to hold out for the people pushing 80 and nab em with giant tickets."
madisonwi,341per,_dicktator,3,Mon Apr 27 21:31:59 2015 UTC,"For sure. You summed up my rationale for speeding. Like I said I usually keep it 65, rarely push 70, but I always seem to be moving with traffic. The people who go 50-55 (like some in this comment thread advocate we do) in the right lane kinda perplex me"
madisonwi,341per,puppymehard,6,Mon Apr 27 21:35:25 2015 UTC,"So long as they stay in the fucking right lane they can do 40 for all I care.  It's all the morons that do 55 in the left lane up here that cause all the congestion problems on the beltline.  Every time I'm caught in a big knot of traffic there's two idiots going the same speed in both lanes holding up a dozen or more cars.  If you don't overtake the person to your right in a few seconds, news flash: you're in the wrong fucking lane.  Don't mind my anger, I only drive from stoughton Rd to Mineral Point every freaking morning and back every freaking afternoon, so I get to experience this stupid crap every day.  Something as simple as slower traffic keeping right would solve so many problems but people here will argue that they shouldn't have to.  Why?  Who fucking knows, they just feel better in the left lane I guess."
madisonwi,341per,WorkplaceWatcher,5,Tue Apr 28 19:07:13 2015 UTC,I don't know why you are perplexed by people who choose to go the speed limit. For financial and safety reasons it is clearly the smarter choice.
madisonwi,341per,gwfanpb,3,Mon Apr 27 21:41:33 2015 UTC,Yeah you're right. I shouldn't be hating. I just like to go a bit faster if I can (especially if mostly moving with traffic and low probability of police presence) and slow people frustrate me. But yeah you're absolutely right.
madisonwi,341per,WorkplaceWatcher,3,Mon Apr 27 21:45:35 2015 UTC,"My reasoning is, yes I'd like to drive 10-15 mph faster than what most speed limits decree. On the other hand, I value not getting pulled over and fined more than I value getting to my destination a few minutes earlier.  Furthermore, I always laugh when I see people speed past me, only to see them right next to me at the next red light."
madisonwi,341per,angrydeuce,2,Tue Apr 28 02:07:48 2015 UTC,Simple solution: go the speed limit. Set your cruise control and don't worry that it'll take you 3 minutes longer to get there.
madisonwi,341per,belandil,6,Mon Apr 27 19:13:18 2015 UTC,It would be nice if the speed limits here were realistic. Most roads need about 10mph bump on the limit to be at standard level.
madisonwi,341per,toepaydoe,6,Mon Apr 27 22:25:06 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with you there. Maybe not 10mph on some (Stoughton Road's in no shape to be doing 65+ on) but the Beltline for sure could see a nice 5mph jump. Some of the worst offenders aren't even the highways. Vondron road is one of those. That one harassed me for years driving down it - always felt the want to go 35mph when it stays 25mph its entire length.   My argument was simply if you're afraid of a speeding ticket, don't speed. And don't piss and moan when you get one if you're speeding."
madisonwi,341per,belandil,4,Mon Apr 27 22:32:13 2015 UTC,"I'm glad I'm not the only one that thinks this.  Got a huge ration of shit in a thread a week or so ago about speed traps when I opined that maybe the speed limits were too fucking low.  They've done studies on this shit, when speed limits are too low it actually causes more accidents because you end up with people weaving in and out of traffic.  Peg the limit to the 85th percentile speed (the speed at which 85% of people will drive at or below on a given road) and you reduce these accidents.  Plus if they would just enforce the whole ""slower traffic keep right"" thing.  Holy shit, I pass on the right a half dozen times a day on my commute because of idiots doing 56 in the left lane.  They're more hazardous than anyone doing 65."
madisonwi,341per,toepaydoe,1 point,Tue Apr 28 13:27:01 2015 UTC,"I strongly disagree with you.  You're thinking about your travel time, but not safety of those who aren't in cars.  Pedestrian fatality rates sharply increase when impact speed is about 40 km/h (25 mph).  If a road with a speed limit of 25 mph has its speed limit increased to 35 mph (56 km/h), as you suggest, the fatality risk would go from about 0.2 to 0.8, a four-fold increase."

madisonwi,342ht0,fartsareamazing,6,Mon Apr 27 20:06:43 2015 UTC,Overnight street parking becomes marginally easier during the summer months. If you are working every week day I think you'll be fine just going for street parking. Might have to walk a few extra blocks but you can use that to work off all those extra chipotle burritos you'll be getting.
madisonwi,342ht0,drunkenAmoeba,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:37:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd be working every week day. If regular parking is anything like trying to find a spot in downtown San Francisco (where I'm from) though, I'm not sure how much marginally easier translates to. Thoughts? (And I'm perfectly happy with slowly becoming one lumbering sweaty burrito over time.)"
madisonwi,342ht0,n609mike,3,Mon Apr 27 20:49:28 2015 UTC,Parking in San Francisco is not comparable to Madison. An alternative is finding a parking spot at a neighboring building.
madisonwi,342ht0,drunkenAmoeba,2,Mon Apr 27 20:57:47 2015 UTC,"Parking in Madison can be difficult, but I can't imagine it compares to SF. It becomes a bit easier to park in the Summer because a lot of the students who live in that area will be gone, freeing up some space.  It all depends on if you are okay spending 5-10 minutes parking and walking back to your apartment every day, and having to move it every ~2 hours if you were to leave it there on a weekday during business hours (you will get ticketed in that area, it's heavily patrolled). If that sounds okay, then go for it. If ~$100/month will give you some peace of mind, that might be worth it too."
madisonwi,342ht0,btf91,1 point,Mon Apr 27 21:07:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think I would be okay with that. Especially in the summer where spending 10 minutes walking would actually be nice..thanks for the advice!"
madisonwi,342ht0,vatoniolo,5,Mon Apr 27 21:42:22 2015 UTC,"As someone who lives on Gilman near State and parks on the street I say you should get the spot so there's less competition.  Lol.  In all fairness you will be fine parking on the street.  I've parked in a lot 3 times since August.  I generally leave around 8 and get back close to 6 or later so I'm outside the times when parking is enforced.  Additionally, they don't check on weekends.  Some streets might check Saturday but most don't.  You can also get a pass from Madison for $21 for the year that lets you park in 2 hour spots (most around the area) for 2 days.  That area is mostly students so there will easily be parking in the summer.  I've lived there since August so I haven't fully experienced summer but if it's anything like how spring break was, there will be lots of spots."
madisonwi,342ht0,drunkenAmoeba,3,Mon Apr 27 21:49:56 2015 UTC,"It very much depends on your schedule. As /u/drunkenAmoeba said your life will be much easier if you work during normal business hours. If not, I would highly reccommend a spot, but not for $150 a month. Mullins Apartments has spots for $110 in what I call the ""gravel pit"" bordered by W Gilman, Gorham/University, and 420 W Gorham"
madisonwi,342ht0,vatoniolo,2,Mon Apr 27 20:49:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I see myself working normal business hours (8-5 probably). Is there a 'sweet spot' when it comes to an ideal time to come back and find a space? Also why do you call it the gravel pit, just out of curiosity?"
madisonwi,342ht0,vatoniolo,3,Mon Apr 27 20:58:57 2015 UTC,"The area can get busier around 5-6 as everyone returns from work and looks for parking, and from people that are getting dinner in the area.  You can park in most metered spots overnight for free (free after 6), just have to be out pretty early in the AM (I think it's 8:00)."
madisonwi,342ht0,Mhm426,2,Mon Apr 27 21:10:23 2015 UTC,"Aha, gotcha. That would work just fine for me!"
madisonwi,342ht0,Mhm426,2,Mon Apr 27 21:47:54 2015 UTC,I would try my luck with street parking in your case. Saturdays might be tricky but not impossible. I lived on State for 6 years and only bought space in the gravel pit in February-March because of snow issues. Most students leave for the summer so it gets much easier to park
madisonwi,342ht0,lol_wutdafuq,2,Mon Apr 27 21:27:17 2015 UTC,Would it be worth getting the city permit to be able to leave it in one spot on Saturdays?
madisonwi,342ht0,btf91,3,Mon Apr 27 21:48:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, but in order to do so you need a copy of a lease or an MG&E bill. You would also be paying for a year and only getting less than 2 months so you have to decide how much it's worth. In my experience parking enforcement isn't ""good"" enough to catch you if you just move it once around 2 pm"
madisonwi,342ht0,Ratscallion,2,Mon Apr 27 22:40:29 2015 UTC,"Definitely do street parking. It's cheap, and yeah you might have to walk a couple blocks unless you get back at the perfect time, but you will be less sad about paying $1.95 for guac."
madisonwi,342ht0,WiscyGirl99,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:42:56 2015 UTC,What would be the perfect time? Also is it metered or free in that area? I looked on Google Maps and it looks free but the images are from 2007...
madisonwi,342ht0,driftlessroundabout,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:54:23 2015 UTC,"So it would depend. There are some meters on W. Gilman but the street parking at meters are free from 6 pm to 8 am. They don't check the ""free"" (2hr) spots after 6pm, so technically if you got back at 5/5:30, you'd be good until 10am (ish) the next morning.  Some people can get away with banking on that since they work every day. Tricky part comes in on Saturdays. With a parking permit, you'd just have to make sure you're not in the same spot for more than 48 hours. You'd be fine on Saturdays, too. Just have to read the signs for street cleaning. It seems it would be easier to just pay the city  $25 (i think) and not worry on Saturdays."
madisonwi,342ht0,new-money,1 point,Mon Apr 27 21:03:29 2015 UTC,Ideally I'd love to avoid parking at meters if possible (then again who wouldn't) but if there are free spots aplenty I would definitely take that chance. I looked into getting the city permit but it would be a bit tricky since I'm currently a Missouri resident and my car and everything is registered in Missouri. I don't suppose there would be a way for me to get that before I land in Madison and change everything over...
madisonwi,342ht0,new-money,1 point,Mon Apr 27 21:47:04 2015 UTC,"There are two (relevant) ways to get a city parking permit. If you have a formal lease for your summer place, you can use that. Out-of-state plates on the car are fine, though it does need to be registered in your name; if it's not, you'll also need a letter giving you permission to use it.  If, like most summer renters, you don't have a formal lease, you can still get a city parking permit, but you need to have your Madison address on both your license and registration, which means you have to get a new license and plate your car here. It's easy to switch them over, but it'll cost you about $150 total."
madisonwi,342ht0,new-money,1 point,Mon Apr 27 23:21:14 2015 UTC,"The first block or two from state street going north east is metered.  Additionally, it is metered on Henry between Gilman and Gorham.  If you park in these, you should make sure you're out by 8:30 and back after 5:30.  Langdon runs parallel to gilman and is mostly meters, and it's frat row, so I generally avoid parking there."

madisonwi,3434gb,lol_wutdafuq,5,Mon Apr 27 23:32:47 2015 UTC,"Don't park there. The lot is under construction. There's a lot in Verona next to the coffee shop. I think it's called Tivoli? There's a shelter with bathrooms and drinking fountains. It's a nice flat trail to walk on. I've run from that lot out to epic and beyond a bunch of times. Not sure if it will be the best to walk out of town from there, takes a bit to get out into the country. You might be better off trying to park at a cross road (off PD) or nearer Mt Horeb and get on the trail there."
madisonwi,3434gb,AdrienneBS,4,Tue Apr 28 01:33:43 2015 UTC,"Tuvalu, yeah - a nice coffee shop. Closer to Mount Horeb the trail gets prettier (IMO) - more woodsy."

I wouldn't want to undercut them because that'd be pretty bad mannered of me, but again I'd want to do a reasonable rate since I'd be doing this more for enjoyment than actually making money (I have an actual job)  I currently do not have an extra violin with me, but it's always an option since I have two back home in a different state that I can get shipped here.

Look online at the Isthmus events calendar, there's usually something free to do every night of the week.  Madison has rec leagues for all kinds of sports. Kickball, softball, ultimate, etc. simple google search will point you in the right direction.   I host a monthly story telling event in the Willy St. neighborhood called Madison Story Slam. We're sponsored by Ale Asylum (local brewery). We do a podcast. We've usually got between 100-150 people who show up. Everyone's friendly, it's super fun and funny, and there's great beer. Our next one is May 16 at the Wil-Mar Neighborhood center. You can find us on Facebook by searching for Madison Story Slam."

Maybe there's a free agent list or just try meeting people through pick-up. Sign ups for summer should start in early May. Games start first week of June."
madisonwi,33ye3w,ElEmoPinata,1 point,Mon Apr 27 03:32:01 2015 UTC,"Post here, you can sign up as a single, or I'm sure there are Facebook groups that can help you find as well.

PACKED during Badger BB or FB as well as Packer games...not unfriendly to other fans though  Food Trucks: Not necessarily trucks, but carts. A lot on Main St on the inner square or a lot down on Library Mall   Meeting people: Low-key bars good places to meet people. Craft Beer week will be a very good time to meet people. I've met people I have now known for 5 years at some of these events.  Dating in Madison is weird. I can't offer much advice in that respect. Maybe don't use Tinder though?"
madisonwi,33ye3w,Mhm426,2,Mon Apr 27 04:51:14 2015 UTC,"Note: Plan B, and I'm pretty sure Cardinal, are LGBT bars. Some LGBT people don't appreciate it when straight people take over their bars."
madisonwi,33ye3w,_stonecoldsaidso,1 point,Mon Apr 27 12:29:10 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of Cardinal being explicitly an LGBT bar. I just know that my friend teaches salsa lessons and dances there a lot.  As for Plan B, I wouldn't call going to dance ""taking over."" I've never felt unwelcome as a patron any time I've been there (I am a woman if that makes any difference) and any of my guy friends who have gone have been hit on, but that's just what might happen at any time. I understand the ""taking over"" part if it became a majority straight people place, but showing up and wanting to have fun one night shouldn't be called that as long as everyone is respectful and has a good time..."
madisonwi,33ye3w,Mhm426,2,Mon Apr 27 13:32:34 2015 UTC,"You might be right about the Cardinal. At some point it became more inclusive.   As for Plan B, I wouldn't call going to dance ""taking over.""   You're correct that one person going to Plan B isn't taking over. However, when you multiply that over the city, it becomes a problem. When Plan B is on the standard list of cool places for straight people to hang out, it ceases to be an LGBT bar, it loses it's identity. I've heard people complain multiple times about straight people overrunning Plan B and about how that situation is a problem in the LGBT community.   Personally, it doesn't affect me. I've never been to Plan B and I probably won't ever go. But it's a complaint my LGBT friends have discussed on multiple occasions."
madisonwi,33ye3w,uncamad,1 point,Mon Apr 27 13:41:18 2015 UTC,I understand that. I guess I just never thought that it got that serious. I also think being 18+ sometimes makes it a weird crowd at Plan B. That's too bad that people feel that way.
madisonwi,33ye3w,AHistoricalFigure,0,Mon Apr 27 14:31:12 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine a ""normal"" bar saying they get too much LGBT patrons. They'd be out of business in a month. Plan B and the patrons need to just accept that straight people like a good dance club, too. Equal rights."

madisonwi,33ye3w,Hykos,9,Mon Apr 27 02:17:42 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with u/Hykos, because Segredo is kind of a creepy shithole.  For a long time it was the only 18+ bar on campus, and it's a mix of kids with fake IDs and old men trying to have sex with said kids.  It's a good place to go if you're A) you're completely trashed B) have enough friends for safety in numbers C) willing to pay huge cover charges for 3rd rate DJs.  I think Pauly D (from the Jersey shore) was playing once and they were charging a 40$ cover.  Anyways, it's not a place where you're going to meet anybody, so maybe steer clear."

madisonwi,33yp6b,seigetnk178,-1,Mon Apr 27 00:07:30 2015 UTC,You need to plan on arriving the night before to get in line for tickets. Morning before wont be enough.

madisonwi,33yp6b,KosherK,3,Mon Apr 27 13:15:10 2015 UTC,Ok so I'm new to Madison - ELI5 why is Great Taste such a big deal?
madisonwi,33yp6b,KosherK,2,Mon Apr 27 14:05:25 2015 UTC,"Cut and paste from above.   For those who don't know, Great Taste of the Midwest is an event where you're given a tasting glass at the gate, and then you spend your afternoon wandering from regional brewer to regional brewer (about 150 of them), filling up and then emptying that glass. Some of the breweries offer limited releases you can't get anywhere else. It's beer, cider, mead, and some other miscellaneous sundries.   The event also arranges for school buses to shuttle people from locations around the city to the site and back again for free, and they have a deal with Union Cab where they'll take you home for $1 -- so no one has to drive home after drinking for 4 hours."
madisonwi,33yp6b,vatoniolo,1 point,Mon Apr 27 14:08:19 2015 UTC,So it's free once you pay the $60
madisonwi,33yp6b,apbadger,2,Mon Apr 27 14:52:26 2015 UTC,"The booze is free.  You can pay extra for bacon on a stick (so good) or lunch food or to dance in the silent disco or promotional tshirts or whatever.  But there are no other definite costs once you pay the $60.  Oh, and I think they sell non-drinking designated driver tickets for $5, if you just want to hang out with a drinking friend or something.  There are non-alcoholic beverages available (I particularly recommend the Silver Creek Blonde Root beer), but not many of them."
madisonwi,33yp6b,vatoniolo,3,Mon Apr 27 14:55:15 2015 UTC,"I say this every year, but unless you really like standing in line and socializing with beer enthusiasts, you're wasting your time. I always get tickets the day of the event because they are sold so far in advance people's plans end up changing. I usually end up getting them for less than face or given to me (but that's likely because the taste always takes place within a week of my birthday)"
madisonwi,33yp6b,apbadger,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:41:11 2015 UTC,"I've heard this from several people, but keep in mind, if too many people followed your advice the likelihood of this being an option goes down : )"
madisonwi,33yp6b,iroh_zenmaster,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:38:07 2015 UTC,"I guess so but I've been saying it for years. I have noticed last minute tickets going for higher than face in recent years, but I just show sellers my ID (the fact that it's my birthday) and use that as a negotiating tool. Even paying $100 beats waiting in line for hours IMO"
madisonwi,33yp6b,Jholmski,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:59:54 2015 UTC,"That's fair.  Replying having just waited in line for the first time, I can say I did not regret it.  It really helped that I had a friend who lived close to the line I was waiting in, so once we got our wristbands I was able to walk over for some breakfast, beer and bathroom.  Overall a pleasant morning, I'm sure I'd enjoy it considerably less if the weather was crap.  Can't wait for the fest!"
madisonwi,33yp6b,diewild,2,Mon May 4 15:15:13 2015 UTC,"I'll be standing in line. If you go morning of, you need to be there by 5:00am to be safe based on my experience at Star last year."

madisonwi,33yp6b,jaw005,2,Mon Apr 27 03:47:41 2015 UTC,Can someone explain why the tickets are so hard to get and why they're $60?
madisonwi,33yp6b,apbadger,4,Mon Apr 27 14:02:02 2015 UTC,"Supply and demand, basically.  High demand + limited supply = high prices.

madisonwi,33tg8i,walkstar2,3,Sat Apr 25 14:51:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's probably what I'll do today."
madisonwi,33tg8i,AnonymousFruitBat,6,Sat Apr 25 15:21:10 2015 UTC,"The arboretum is an awesome place to run! Very pretty scenery. There is a vistor's center about halfway through with bathrooms and bubblers. Most of the trail has a sandy/gravelly shoulder. It is only open to motorists on Sunday (with the exclusion of the few people who live in houses in the arboretum). To tack on some extra mileage, you could go through the arboretum, past the back of the zoo, past Edgewood, up Monroe St. to campus."
madisonwi,33tg8i,TheDerpShop,4,Sat Apr 25 14:40:19 2015 UTC,"I've ran in the arboretum a couple times, maybe i'll try to plan out a longer route that includes it."
madisonwi,33tg8i,augen_zu_und_durch,6,Sat Apr 25 15:21:50 2015 UTC,"I always enjoyed running on the bike paths if you do not want to hit trails. The southwest commuter trail from camp Randal down to the beltline and back is almost perfectly 10k.  If you want to get out of town you can drive to Military Ridge or Badger trails.  They are paved for awhile, although eventually become crushed sandstone.  Monona is a nice loop.  Arboretum on its own is about 10k, but if you go up to the bike path over where it comes out on seminal (up the hill kitty corner to the exit, not seminal, and it brings you to a bridge over the beltline which connects to southwest trail) then it is about 9 miles.  I personally enjoy trail running though, you should give it a shot. It builds up your stabalizers.  9 springs has a ton of trails, pheasent brach has some.  The arboretum has a bunch (dont forget about arb south)."
madisonwi,33tg8i,ace1970,2,Sat Apr 25 16:56:51 2015 UTC,"I actually do like trail running quite a bit.  Although I tend to run slower to just make sure I don't twist an ankle.  I've ran through most of the arboretum by now (including south).  There are also some good trails up north of picnic point, but they only are a couple miles in length.  How does parking work at nine springs?"
madisonwi,33tg8i,Unicorn_Cavalry,1 point,Sat Apr 25 17:22:31 2015 UTC,"Parking is free at Nine Springs, just pull in. It's good for skiing in the winter and the entire loop is about two miles. Totally flat with marsh grasses. I wouldn't make a special trip to run it unless you use it as an access point for Lake Farm County Park or the Cap City Trail (paved). Could be buggy. I've only skied Lake Farm, it's wide open. Maybe you'd like it, if you do let us know."

Finish with a sprint or as fast as you can possibly manage up bascom Hill.   Great urban run, minimal car traffic to deal with. I found the amount of people watching made me go faster and push."

This keeps me motivated, and never running the same route twice keeps things interesting. I use strava, then sync with www.citystrides.com."
