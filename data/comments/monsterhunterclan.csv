Just search for GQ86+with Seregios and join, they're normally pretty quick to fill up and folks are pretty understanding as long as you aren't running around with no skills or totally stupid gear.

monsterhunterclan,3d4t8k,tomokochi,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:34:26 2015 UTC,Lookup mh frontier guide on google it should be the first result from reddit. And no you can set it up in an instant depending on your download speed. Using a vpn gives a lot of lag between each player but not for the monster so that's good. The language is a problem but not that much for materials and items as you can translate them easily.

monsterhunterclan,3cvdsa,imthe666st,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:21:32 2015 UTC,"For those struggling to download the quest: On step 4, in SKFU, select the ""HTTP(S) Rules"" tab. From there, paste http://goshawk.capcom.co.jp/3ds/mh4g_eu_/m60101.mib into the ""Source"" box, and http://puu.sh/iUN5I/1bec5dd623.mib into the ""Target"" box. Then press ""Add Rule"". If you're playing on the NA version of 4U, paste this into your ""Source"" box instead: http://goshawk.capcom.co.jp/3ds/mh4g_us_/m60101.mib After that, make sure your IP address matches the one in the box on the bottom that says ""Pr0xy IP"". The final steps are as following: Close all open applications with the internet running in them. Select System Settings, then Internet Settings. Next, press Connection Settings, and select your connection. Select Change Settings. Go to the second page, and select Proxy Settings. Select Yes, then Detailed Setup. In the top box, input your IP that you found earlier. In the bottom box, enter 8080. In SKFU, click the Start button to the right of the box with your IP in it. Now, open Monster Hunter. On the DLC page, find the quest with the original name of the custom quest that you are downloading (in this case, ""Out of Time""). Then, download it. After you're done, save and exit your game. Go back into System Settings, and where you selected Yes in Proxy Settings, select No. This turns off the proxy connection to your DS, and reverts to your standard internet connection settings. Go back to SKFU, and press Stop. This turns off the proxy completely so you may go back to playing on your standard internet connection settings. Now, when you select the quest, it will have the custom quest's details instead of the original quest. If you want to get the original, official DLC back, just re-download it on your standard internet connection. Special thanks to /u/joshyboy1994"
