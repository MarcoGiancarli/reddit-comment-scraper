I have about 250 alliance credits I can't use as I've already maxed out KJJ and have all the supporting cards.

And i have games where the other team can't get out of my combo enders and games when he barely does one or two. The most annoying part is that sometimes when i have ra's scimi and my adversary has over one bars of spell i do not hit a single combo ender until he used the spell so the power drain is useless and i hate it when it happens because the first combo after the spell has a combo ender

As suggested by others, Arkham pack is the only one that can guarantee AODS, challenge packs have huge range of cards so you might be opening those packs for the rest of your life and never see another one. That's why I spent millions on Femme Fatale packs to get that Batgirl to E7."

InjusticeMobile,3dylup,rjjjr82,9,Mon Jul 20 16:22:38 2015 UTC,"Her main use is definitely her passives, but her attack and health stats are strong and she's an effective character in her own right. The way I see it is that you can use her for support and not have to worry about your other two characters being glass cannons. When I have 600WW on my team I rarely use her, but if I get unlucky and my other two cards get knocked out early, I know I can rely on her to finish the fight even if it's not quick. This is where AniHQ isn't as good. If my other two characters are dead, AniHQ usually isn't good enough to finish a fight against more than one character. Her only real weapon is her S2, she isn't as quick, and her health is a lot worse than 600WW.  I would recommend not using 600WW and AniHQ together - IMO you really want two strong offensive female characters, which there are a lot of. Any combination of  Batgirl prime, CCBG, Raven, BRC, and either KF in your first two slots will make for easy wins with 600WW as the third.  Also, for gear, I just overload S1 gear on 600WW since her use in fights is generally brief. Her signature gear with hook and chain (or arcane wand) and bone spikes is a good combination, allowing for crit chance, stun chance, increased damage, and heal all on S1."
InjusticeMobile,3dylup,doodledeedoodle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:45:00 2015 UTC,I play S1 intensive Harley. stun and disable on S1. ibistick for extra fun. cannot stay on the field with that.
InjusticeMobile,3dylup,Aurora_Panagathos,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:33:59 2015 UTC,But isn't Harley really designed more for S2? I mean just with the automatic team heal from her sig gear. I always see her as more support character (usually play AniHQ with KJJ and Ares) though. It's a great surprise when I somehow end up with just Harley and she's able to pull off a win :)
InjusticeMobile,3dylup,clayscarface,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:58:03 2015 UTC,"I don't care about heal that much. When there is the need to heal, shit already happened, plus most 7 match battle has RKF.   Another thing is that her dynamite though unblockable is heavily penalized.  The good point in her S1 is that it hits 4 times, allowing most stun or disable effect to trigger."
InjusticeMobile,3dylup,Aurora_Panagathos,4,Wed Jul 22 00:45:54 2015 UTC,"I've been loving Killer Frost, Batgirl and WW600. The power generation and extra bar and I usually just wipe people out with KF."
InjusticeMobile,3dylup,Jmm060708,2,Mon Jul 20 18:15:15 2015 UTC,"True, WW600 isn't anything special by herself, but one thing I haven't seen anyone mention is her S2, which doesn't inflict massive damage in and of itself, but deals the best bleed damage in the game (unless I've overlooked something, feel free to prove me wrong). This can work to your advantage in two ways: first, it can force a tag-out, which may be advantageous depending on the situation; second, you can unleash the S2 on someone who just tagged in and watch with glee as your opponents health quickly plummets.  As for gear, I have a bit of an unconventional setup with her, but hear me out:  The Ibistick: boosts power gen, damage to S1 and S2, and adds burning damage to both specials. The combined bleed/burn damage from her S2 is great, and sometimes just for fun, I'll hit the last remaining opponent with that S2 and just block and watch their health drop to nothing.  Ra's Al Ghul's Scimitar: damage boost to basic attacks, 1 bar of starting power, and power drain on combo ender. This is useful for both offense and defense, since WW600 is one of the few characters who use her combo ender when controlled by the AI. Get a rhythm going with basic attacks, keep the opponents power to a minimum, and wait for the right time to unleash that S2, which leads me to...  Martian Manhunter Garb: health boost and heal on S2. This will give her a much needed health boost, and a nice heal whenever you get that S2 off.   Pair her with AniHQ and pretty much any decent third female character and you should have no problem winning ultimate battles consistently. I rarely even have to switch out with her, but I do to speed the battles up a bit. Her S2 fills pretty quickly, and you can stall with her as long as you like until someone else's S2 is ready, tag out, unleash a teammate's S2, and bring WW back in whenever you feel like it. I usually only use her S1 (which hits hard) to kill Raven or for a KO, but just a side note: knock someone out with either special and the burning damage is applied to whoever tags in."
InjusticeMobile,3dylup,Smellyjuji,3,Mon Jul 20 21:14:28 2015 UTC,use an S2 to force a tag out is really desperate. S2 should kill. and opponent can tag out freely so i doubt if u can watch them bleed.
InjusticeMobile,3dylup,Aurora_Panagathos,3,Mon Jul 20 22:20:42 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree.   This can work to your advantage in two ways: first, it can force a tag-out, which may be advantageous depending on the situation; second, you can unleash the S2 on someone who just tagged in and watch with glee as your opponents health quickly plummets.  opponent can tag out freely so I doubt if u can watch them bleed   Here's what I meant by that: Say you're beginning a fight and the opponent leads with AO Bats. Pretty common right? Right off the bat (no pun intended) I'll try (and usually land) a basic combo with a finisher to drain power, which will then prompt Batman's S1. Block, land another combo. Now I've got WW's S2 ready to go, but I know from experience that good ol' Bats is about to tag out, so maybe I land one more basic combo and hold on to the S2. Sure enough, he tags out and let's say just for shits that a tanky Darkseid tags in, although I do realize it could be anyone. Now I've got the S2 locked and loaded, and I know Darkseid won't be able to tag out right away, so I unleash WW's S2 and now Darkseid is taking heavy bleed damage, while burning, all the while getting pummeled by WW's basic attacks.   force a tag out is really desperate   Perhaps this can be seen as desperate by some, but for me, it's not so much that I'm forcing the tag out, it's that I know my opponent will tag out as a result, so let me see if I can use this to my advantage. Say you're facing one of those KJJ, Shazam, and whoever teams (Static, Godfall Supes, Darkseid, etc.) and you're dealing with the Joker. If possible, you want to avoid killing him so you don't risk dealing with Shazam's super. Hit KJJ with an intentionally underpowered S2 from WW and he'll tag out. Now maybe I've got Raven or KF prime ready or almost ready with one of their own S2s. If Shazam tags in, I'll land a combo, maybe block his S1, and by that time most likely, hit Shaz with that S2 I've built up with KF or Raven, which can KO with the right gear.  I'm not saying this works all of the time, but in certain situations I think these tactics can be helpful."

InjusticeMobile,3dylup,HITNRUNXX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:49:12 2015 UTC,"I tend to use KF, AniHQ and 600WW. With the right gear, 600WW can wipe the board by herself - i can get her damage to about 6k per hit. Since everyone and their brother seems to have AOBats or AODS, she is the sacrifice character to take that first S2 or and S1 from AODS. I pump her with reflect gear and get lucky occasionally. If not, then she might survive. KF and AniHQ with her heal on S2, can restore everyone to max quickly."
InjusticeMobile,3dylup,daxel123,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:27:02 2015 UTC,with Ras on KF sometimes i can get a combo off draining AOBats so he cant get off SP2. Then he uses SP1. The KF whipes out the board.
InjusticeMobile,3dylup,nakednark,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:57:01 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, I thought that WW600 would be more of a tank, but her damage and health stats are pretty low which is really upsetting. I find myself just using her for her passive and that kind of bothers me because I feel like your limited by the team combinations you can have."
InjusticeMobile,3dylup,LacidOnex,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:29:56 2015 UTC,"Okay - let me explain how I've always used her. Granted I have nearly perfect gears, and I've missed the last few four star pieces out of apathy.  She's a fairly high HP character, so giving her the venom harness for an increase to total HP and an S1 heal is perfect. Now, a lot of people will disagree but I give her statics disk instead of her shield. I like the reflect chance for ALL better than just an S2.  Now, if you give her either her shield (serious nerf to blocked damage, but also a very high chance to reflect S2s) or even better, an S1 and power gen gear like zatannas wand, she can basically be invincible.  She's ultimately an anchor char. She won't kill another healing char unless you have the ability to spam S1, she has no use for damage or crit gear (hawkgirl is best for this). But through stupidity I've lost my raven, been stuck with a training char (like KF but at level 30 when I'm fighting perfect 50s), lost that, and then managed to pull a victory against those stupid Shazam AOB KJJ teams. With basically just shield toss and recouping the tiny damage that actually gets through."
InjusticeMobile,3dylup,Aurora_Panagathos,2,Mon Jul 20 20:07:59 2015 UTC,"agree. her S2 is the main problem. fighting with a S2 that does not kill is awful! I put disc, sword and shield and Harness. Reflect like a mirror and spam s1. she can either tank or solo. my other 2 does not heal, i can count on Ww to solo when i screw up"
InjusticeMobile,3dylup,kopkiwi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:28:23 2015 UTC,"You're using her wrong. Put crit S2 gear on her, heal for s2 and S1 stun and she's a tank."

InjusticeMobile,3dylup,kopkiwi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:14:56 2015 UTC,She hits 4 times on her S2. Normally with S2 crit gear you can get two of those hits to crit. Add those up and she can do around 55k of damage plus the bleed from it at around 4k per second. Adds up.
InjusticeMobile,3dylup,Aurora_Panagathos,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:25:08 2015 UTC,can i have a detail gear set? definitely will try
InjusticeMobile,3dylup,kopkiwi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:07:25 2015 UTC,"I go with the demon sword, or Ravens cloak, though it's better for her if she's on your team, (S2 boost and crit chance on S2) and her own gear will give the stun on S1. Then the 3rd gear is either a power gen, or an S2 heal. Taken your pick. I use her basically as a quick power hitter once her S2 is charged as once the opponent is bloody others damage increases."
InjusticeMobile,3dylup,shadyone33,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:19:35 2015 UTC,"I use her with 2 crit boost gears and a SP1 heal gear and she does good for me. With the extra energy generating she can spam the SP1 all day long. My go to team is:  WW600 equipped with: Knife Collection, Powered Eskrima Sticks and Netherrealm Kama. Killer Frost equipped with: Blade of the War God, Kryptonian Battle Suit, Ra's Al Ghul's Dagger. Cassandra Cain Batgirl equipped with: Cloak of Destiny, Mutated Bone Spikes, Promethium Long Sword.   All gear maxed.  This team is too good. Wonder Woman hits for 6300 on Crit, CCBG hits for 9700 crit and her SP1 if you get the stun is 69 or 70k damage. I rarely use Killer Frost but when I do its to use her SP2 and then tag out."
InjusticeMobile,3dylup,Irishlb14,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:10:54 2015 UTC,"She was a better card when you could chain her special one, but she is an excellent support character that fits well on several different teams. When you promote her higher you will notice how great of a card she really is. I do agree that AniHQ is better because she can heal and  her passive works with everyone instead of only with characters with slits, but WW600 is still one of the top cards in the game."
InjusticeMobile,3dylup,Abbhrsn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:52:09 2015 UTC,"Yea, the way I use the team is with WW600 and AniHQ buffing up another character, like KF or Raven or any tanky female character you like.  I actually prefer swapping out AniHQ on the team though and using Prime Batgirl, WW600, and KF.  The female characters are so powerful in this damn game..lol, makes me wish they'd add someone that boosted male characters"
InjusticeMobile,3dylup,Abbhrsn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:30:46 2015 UTC,i tried that too it was better but not as good as i thought. I actually used AOBats KF with Ras and BG and it was really successful. Being able to launch 2 SP2s right away and BG special 1 with CLOAK is really brutal.
InjusticeMobile,3dylup,Abbhrsn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:42:01 2015 UTC,"Ya, that's a nice little combo.  The 600WW really helps with that extra power gen though, my KF generates power so quickly, plus with the scimitar she does power drain at the end of her combos so it's hard to fight back against her.  And with her gear her S2 does lifedrain which makes it even harder to kill her"

Seems like 80+% of the time the enemy will block when I hit special 1 and while it still does some damage it wont stun. Seriously the amount of time I spend punching into blocks makes me think trying to rely on stuns a waste of time. Better to just amp up the damage.
InjusticeMobile,3dwopc,beomagi,2,Mon Jul 20 09:17:54 2015 UTC,"If your specials are being blocked, you need to work on timing.

InjusticeMobile,3dx384,XxXZeusKillerXx,0,Mon Jul 20 06:40:23 2015 UTC,"You could easily cut that time in half by giving ares the ibis stick and batgirl the cloak. Start with a god smack, then sweep with batgirl's now op s1."

InjusticeMobile,3dx384,Perfectblood,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:53:40 2015 UTC,"I agree with you so much! People need to understand that there is teams for speed if you want to grind BP faster but they are usually pretty boring( at least to me) And the other options that doesn't necessarily make matches faster but rather fun are usually underrated because of the same reason, I mean pair any character with batgirl, area, aods, raven, etc.... And yes you will have boring easy matches but where is the challenge?"
InjusticeMobile,3dx384,XxXZeusKillerXxX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:21:07 2015 UTC,"Yep, and I like the Static, Ares Batgirl team as it makes you time your Specials. Also, by not putting Cloak on Batgirl, the only overpowered character there is Ares when opponent is stunned. Otherwise, the enemy team has a fair chance of winning as well and you have longer and more enjoyable matches. Though I have 100% success rate so far, it doesn't mean those matches aren't enjoyed, it just means I am using it perfectly or how it was intended to."
InjusticeMobile,3dwey8,gondi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:27:06 2015 UTC,"I'll give you my full team, do keep in mind I have MP Season gears on them, but if you don't have them I'll also include a replacement.  Killer Frost Lv. 50 EVII  Thermafrost Necklace +10  Ibistick +10 [Substitute: Any gear that gives +Basic Damage and Critical on Basic Attacks. Examples are Netherrealm Kama, powered Eskrima Sticks, etc...]  Knife Collection/ Mutated Bone Spikes +10 [I sometimes use either, doesn't matter as they're the same.]  Wonder Woman 600 Lv. 50 EVII  Knife Collection/ Mutated Bone Spikes +10 [This is why I said whichever as I use both in this team.]  Netherrealm Kama +10 [Once again you can use any gear that gives same stats as this.]  Gauntlets of Azrael +10 [Substitutes: Arcane wand; Promethium Longsword/ Any other that has same stats; Amazonian Sword & Shield. I rotate between all of these just for fun or cause I'm bored.]  Animated Harley Quinn Lv. 50 EVII  Dual .357 Revolvers +10  Venom Injection System +10  Kryptonian Battle Suit +10  You may have noticed I usually like them to heal on their SP1. Well, that's because I mostly spam their SP1s and healing on it is VERY helpful, at least for me it is anyways. I usually tank with WW600 and then pop in KF so she slows down the enemy while doing very high damage. If you can use her SP2 then do it immediately and try not to get blocked as it does massive damage and usually kills any opponent even at 100% health. Harley is usually in the sidelines unless I want to pop a heal, damage boost, or just want to do some damage if she's the only one who can use a special at the moment. I enjoy this team and have had over 85% success rate with it, good luck!"
InjusticeMobile,3dwey8,XxXZeusKillerXxX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:11:54 2015 UTC,I actually had a very similar opinion about the gear setup. Only difference is that I try to concentrate on an sp2 heal rather than an sp1. How do you make the lower heal of sp1 as compared to that of sp2 useful?
InjusticeMobile,3dwey8,XxXZeusKillerXx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:12:35 2015 UTC,"Because you can spam SP1 constantly and since the SP1 is a one hit, it's better for Raven while still does 20k damage. 25% on SP2 is less than 30% on x2 SP1"

You could replace critical with a good blocking gear to make her full tank, but I don't have any right now. Then I have Harley in support duty, with the gauntlets, and revolvers. I also have some damage boost on her just in case. My killer frost prime is my main attacker, with ibis Stick, mutated bone spikes and bloody sword. I haven't had any trouble with ultimate battels.

InjusticeMobile,3dvxqd,Devlyn16,2,Mon Jul 20 13:40:24 2015 UTC,I just hate cards that you can only promote via packs. Id rather grind and save up to EVII one card at a time. Especially when a pack has a card (AniHQ) that i already have and i can only sell it for 44K.

As far as I know, they still don't work (at least not for me). Not sure if it's a bug/glitch or was that an intentional change in the gameplay?  What comes to challenge reset glitch, the jury is still out. For me (Android 5.0.1, Galaxy S4), it got fixed during AO Joker challenge (few challenges away), but there are still people experiencing the glitch.  The main changes with the last update was the new set of challenge characters (AO Joker, AO Bane, Regime Hawkgirl which currently runs and the next one which should be Bounty Hunter Lobo) and a set of legendary gear available from special MP Season (Mysterious Artifact/Ibistick, Gloves/Gauntlets of Azrael and Cloak/Cloak of Destiny)."

One of the WB-employed admins (as opposed to the just-passionate-gamer mods) stated on the official WB forums that the breaking of combo-into-special chains was a glitch and would be fixed. Obviously, it's been quite some time already without it being fixed -- but remember that it took them months to fix the ""characters don't generate power past the second bar while tagged out"" glitch, too. I expect it will be fixed with the next major update (the one the will be released for both platforms, adding the next round of challenge cards and so forth)."

InjusticeMobile,3dt8ul,Aurora_Panagathos,3,Sun Jul 19 09:10:54 2015 UTC,Either Nightwing or Lex. Both are great at juggling and are power drainers. Lex is the better of the two mainly because of the damage boost. Those two with Flash is the best bronze team.

InjusticeMobile,3dt8ul,TheMManhunter,0,Sun Jul 19 06:48:53 2015 UTC,"Depends what you want.  As a solo card nothing beats the flash. Quick, smooth, high damage, and specials that are good for carrying on the damage if the first person dies. (Note: I don't have n52 flash and don't remember what he does so he might be better)  Support  goes to lex luthor or nightwing. Depends who has better stats. If they are about the same I'd give it to lex because I find his combos smoother (giving the enemy less chance to counter attack)  Catwoman has potential for use with the gold Catwoman but only in really specific circumstances. Maybe with darkseid thrown in?  Another with potential would be cyborg. Already a decent player by himself (basically a slightly worse flash but with healing) he can be boosted by darkseid and teamed with ttcyborg for a hard to kill switching team.  Now time to talk about the bad. Harley. She was mentioned and is often hyped. She is mostly good for boosting the joker (usually 2 jokers and a Harley or two Harleys and a joker) but she is terrible by herself and the joker isn't the best person to boost because his passive requires his death.  Since Grundy was mentioned I'll just say he is a solid player but doesn't have anything to make him stand out as a possible #1. Good addition to any bronze team.   Deathstroke was also mentioned. I don't really like him. Good stats and everything but the mix of his sub par combos and his passive make him a loser in my book. This is because his passive resets when he switches (if I remember right) so you have to leave him out which means you have to deal with his crappy combos. So the only situation he is useful is to switch in and kill something at the last second then use his special on the next person.  Edit: my memory is terrible and I just came back after quitting the game for a few months or something so please correct me if I got some details wrong."
InjusticeMobile,3dt8ul,Feminineside,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:48:53 2015 UTC,The passive you are talking about for deathstroke is for the silver version not the bronze.
InjusticeMobile,3dt8ul,TheMManhunter,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:29:22 2015 UTC,That's right. Pretty sad forgetting a passive from my own bronze team.
InjusticeMobile,3dt8ul,Jmm060708,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:17:34 2015 UTC,I'm going to have to go with lex. He can power drain and he damage boost is useful when farming bb6.   This game is all about farming so I have to go with him.

InjusticeMobile,3dsr8b,beomagi,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:30:06 2015 UTC,"Passive should be somewhat themed. Flash returning with 20% is nothing like flash. That needs to go to characters with high constitution.  How about intangiblity - flash cannot be hit with a basic attack, and reduces damage from specials by 25% for 4 seconds on tag-in.  Since we know the Flash can vibrate through attacks.  I'd also day he needs a different tap attack to reflect his speed. 5 or 6 hits with ender.  Of course ideas may be interesting but we'll never likely see these in the game."

InjusticeMobile,3drpce,strallweat,2,Sat Jul 18 20:29:37 2015 UTC,"A few things:   There is no Bronze Wonder Woman, did you mean Silver? Yes, support cards affects all characters if the same name, no matter what tier. Regime Wonder Woman is a good start, btw not worth buying individually. She's good to grind with and stuff, although she did take quite a power dip now that you can't chain specials into you basic attacks, but she's alright for a beginner Gold.    Hope this helps :)"
InjusticeMobile,3drpce,IronTitan12345,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:35:38 2015 UTC,"I'm an idiot. It's silver. I looked up in past posts about regime wonder woman and I heard she had a big drop in her passive ability. When should I start investing in leveling up her skills? One last question. I can't sell support cards unless I have more than one,  right?  I appreciate the help and answers btw."
InjusticeMobile,3drpce,IronTitan12345,2,Sat Jul 18 20:39:55 2015 UTC,"So basically, Regime Wonder Woman's best ability is her Shield Toss. Decently high damage, easy to land 200% and it only costs 9k to max out. It's definitely worth it to max that our ASAP. I've always found her second ability to be a little disappointing, so I wouldn't make it a priority to level that up, just unlock the first level to store excess power. Same goes for her Super, since it costs 50k to max out. Keep in mind this is primarily for Single Player. If you're looking for defensive wins in MP, then investing in her S2 is a decent idea (though I still wouldn't do it). Just maxing her S1 and getting one level in her S2 and Super us the most cost efficient way to level up her skills while still maintaining some essence of power. Yeah, you can only sell duplicate copies of support cards."

InjusticeMobile,3dqlur,Kangarou,2,Sat Jul 18 14:32:06 2015 UTC,I've hit 200% on her sp2 and the other side was able to block it.
InjusticeMobile,3dqlur,nakednark,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:10:43 2015 UTC,Is everyone's s2 for regime hawkgirl like rediculously fast? The tap circle goes away so damn fast for me.  But I think it is unlockable if it crits at 200% because you can't crit if they block it. If it is under 200% it can be blocked.
InjusticeMobile,3dqlur,BobTaco,-1,Sun Jul 19 06:05:22 2015 UTC,"If you read Regime Hawkgirl's passive, the last part states that getting 200% on her second special makes it critical (and unblockable)."
InjusticeMobile,3dqlur,astrospeedyj,7,Sat Jul 18 14:34:27 2015 UTC,"Nope, it just says it Crits. She also disables specials upon tag-in. That's all that's written there. Nothing about being unblockable."
InjusticeMobile,3dqlur,astrospeedyj,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:40:25 2015 UTC,The unblockable is included with the critical.
InjusticeMobile,3dqlur,astrospeedyj,4,Sat Jul 18 14:43:12 2015 UTC,"Which is weird, because for AODS, it specifically says CRIT and UNBLOCKABLE. Odd how they didn't note both for her."
InjusticeMobile,3dqlur,IronTitan12345,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:53:48 2015 UTC,"I agree, that's why part of me thinks that it wasn't intended to include unblockable with the crit."

InjusticeMobile,3dr4ja,XxXZeusKillerXxX,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:37:05 2015 UTC,"The problem I see for RHG is that her passive revolves around proactively limiting an opponents ability to use specials... which Killer Frost already does, and does it better, albeit- passively. The second part of hawkgirl's passive makes her special two more deadly by giving it a mechanism to crit, but it's blockable and can be difficult to guarantee. Killer Frost's special two is far easier to use and has unblockable built in, making it extremely reliable. In either case, KFP is just better..."

Also, if you face Raven then just kill her with DD. That's it, have fun!"
InjusticeMobile,3dnfuv,garthy1982,2,Fri Jul 17 18:25:36 2015 UTC,"20-30 seconds every time with Batgirl, Raven and WW600  batgirl same gear as your pic, instantly do S1 most of the time they  get a don't block of and if it Crits it is the first insta kill. Switch to raven instantly use her S2 as the switch is normally in the middle of their attacks so they can't block that so there's another instant death the last hit of the S2 also will hit the 3rd enemy character. Switch back to Batgirl whose S1 is almost charged again. charge it, activate bang game over. 20-30 secs consistently."
InjusticeMobile,3dnfuv,CoalhouseWalker,3,Sat Jul 18 09:02:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah that is another good team, ww600 makes the other 2 monsters, and that is a good strategy by starting with batgirl, I can see it most of the time not being blocked.  I like the comb that I suggested because it has characters that aren't too common and they are all being used so they served a purpose and I'm guessing any team that wants to be 30 sec or lower has to have batgirl =]"
InjusticeMobile,3dnfuv,peacebuster,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:01:08 2015 UTC,"But... why do you have two gears that boost Damage on Crit on Batgirl but no crit to basic attack gears? Seems like instead of just chance to crit on S1, you'd be better off with basic critting. And if you're just planning to toss that S1 out once, there's no need for the power gen. Also, Switching in BG 2nd rather than 3rd might speed things up, since you can 1-hit the second enemy with her S1 before switching DD in to clean up. Though in that case, you might as well put someone in who has a higher damage stat, since his passive won't matter here either way.  Definitely some strong cards there and a good option for fast matches - just giving my 2 cents."
InjusticeMobile,3dnfuv,peacebuster,2,Fri Jul 17 20:05:24 2015 UTC,"I gave your suggestion a try and here are the results.  Batgirl basic hits are weak even with the basic/crit dmg gear, and I noticed that her sp1 doesn't crit as much compared to the 60% crit chance I had with the original gear set up and this also means that I have to stay with her longer until I build her sp1 for a possible crit hit, therefore taking longer. =\  Overall the matches took longer, the reason I had DD second is because he hits like a truck, his heavy swipe hits between 7-10k so 5 of those and the other guy is almost dead and his sp2 is almost up by them so it makes the match go by quicker."

That helped me a lot to understand the power of everyone single card, how to make it usefull, how to strategize my teams. Which in later stage /but months ago I've posted teams and card reviews based on this knowledge/  I've made new account around static challenge, just because it was stupid to play MP and to face 5 teams. All the time. So now I keep my cards max E5 and evolved little gear, juat because it do the work for me.  So, I don't blame you, it was harsh to happen something like this.   Keep playing dude."

How can I blame someone for wanting to have the full experience without investing a ton into a little mobile game? Multiplayer isn't even PvP, cheating for chars and such doesn't even negatively affect other players. The only kind that hurts other players is hacking BR, which I am against. This is coming from the guy who spends waaaay too much time and effort on this game and producing content for this sub, I do not fault anyone for wanting a short cut to the full experience."

InjusticeMobile,3dohev,Deadly_Joke,3,Sun Jul 19 10:44:49 2015 UTC,"Nah I was saying you're a troll because of your attitude in general bud, but it seems pretty genuine  I already addressed the revenue nonsense. It's a next to zero percent loss from just hackers and it promotes visibility of the awesome parts of the game, encouraging others to pay to get there  And the unfair advantage in MP doesn't make sense either because he still has to do the work to earn the BP just like legit players like myself, that's not a shortcut he's taking"
InjusticeMobile,3dohev,beomagi,2,Fri Jul 17 23:38:52 2015 UTC,"If everyone did it then the game would be the exact same as it is now.

InjusticeMobile,3dohev,Greidam,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:45:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure what you're going for here. Do you think people paying for energy and money is the majority of the revenue this game makes? Or even if it were that it's enough to pay for the costs of running this game? Because neither of those are the case. They aren't the case for most every mobile game. Even Angry Birds makes most of its money from merchandising.

InjusticeMobile,3dohev,Perfectblood,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:48:49 2015 UTC,"There is a huge difference between hacking and using an in-game exploit. It doesn't take away from anyone's profits as the people who glitch from the start are obviously too impatient to grind for things and would never pay for stuff anyway meaning they would just stop playing all together. I have never used the money glitches. But i have used the time changing one before so i can do more battles in a day as i don't always have endless hours to play and i can't afford to constantly pay a  real life price to play a mobile game more often than 3 battles with a team every two hours. Its hardly going to break their companies. And Greidam's done a lot of work for this forum, a few manners and a little respect will get you a lot further in life than rudeness ever will."

By the way, you could just buy a silver Doomsday for a lot cheaper, 2 strong golds can easily beat Standard and Expert levels of the Challenge. And if you are trying to reset the challenge, you could do it after Expert right? (Don't really know it works). I think you only need gold Doomsday for Nightmare (if then either) and then you may need him at higher elite level, so it costs even more when you could just spend those coins to directly promote Hawkgirl?

InjusticeMobile,3dja0h,simulcat,2,Thu Jul 16 19:38:52 2015 UTC,LOL I'm picturing 1 second matches
InjusticeMobile,3dja0h,Devlyn16,2,Thu Jul 16 19:47:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Not working for me. I tried a team with Batman (any batman), Ares, Batgirl. Batman stuns, then I tag in Ares and run his S2. It takes about a third to a half off others' health, but not more than that. So the matches still take almost 30 seconds."
InjusticeMobile,3dja0h,simulcat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:05:17 2015 UTC,"No, that would put them down to 1hp."
InjusticeMobile,3dja0h,peteroh9,2,Thu Jul 16 20:29:49 2015 UTC,Right. So we need data on this: how does damage done with the Cloak affect Area Effects.
InjusticeMobile,3dja0h,simulcat,-1,Thu Jul 16 20:44:38 2015 UTC,Did someone say something?
InjusticeMobile,3dja0h,simulcat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:58:40 2015 UTC,Concerning area effect:  The damage total would not be as high as 502 because the bloody sword doesn't boost damage but on MP I was able to do just over 90K on area effect.   When WW600 tagged in she had 1HP left. Quick kill. The problem is it takes time to produce the conditions in order to make the extremely high damage so the battles are not much quicker. 25-40 seconds.
InjusticeMobile,3dja0h,simulcat,2,Thu Jul 16 21:04:36 2015 UTC,Just out of curiosity: why does it take time to produce the conditions? So my strategy was to start with Batman to stun and tag in Ares with the cloak for the S2. That takes a few seconds (since Bats needs to get an unblocked S1). But I didn't get anyone reduced to anything like 1hp.
InjusticeMobile,3dja0h,CiobySpartanu,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:32:14 2015 UTC,For Ares to produce that much damage you can't give him the scimitar and you can't use batgirl. So you have to wait for his special 2 to build. Thus this takes time. Plus you have to use Harley's damage boost thus taking more time.
InjusticeMobile,3djq6j,zdragonkillah,2,Thu Jul 16 20:45:47 2015 UTC,"You can still use the daily golds for those cards, but they're not very high drop rates. I'd recommend the Femme Fatale pack to upgrade Harley if you don't already have BRCW and 600WW maxed out. If those three are your only remaining cards to elite that you can purchase, I'd go for just buying their cards outright."

InjusticeMobile,3dj360,Zenima,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:10:31 2015 UTC,"Get 75k daily packs until you have a really large roster of e5+ cards and some e7 cards from it.  Anything extra can go towards what you want. Personally I would go for one of the premium packs, such as Femme Fatale, Most Wanted, or Bleed Out, but you can also promote specific characters you like or buy gear lockers.  But seriously, 75k packs are too good to pass up early on."
InjusticeMobile,3dj360,IronTitan12345,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:40:24 2015 UTC,"Exactly what jedispyder said. Plus the 75k packs are identical to to 100k packs, so just keep getting those to let your roster grow."

As for coming up against them cant say I ever have yet come up against a hacker in MP. And if you do hundreds of MP fights per season its maybe likely that youll come up against hackers only a handful of times anyways and some of the time youll beat them. So all in all the hackers have little to no affect on people anyways.  As for taking the fun out of it, id say it introduces more fun, it makes you think more about your battle and team composition, keeps you on your feet. Makes you loose a few times so be it. The only thing boring about a game is if it becomes to easy and no new challenges ever come along and the new gear stops that from happening."

You have a lot of favorites, but you have to sacrifice something to get THIS combo effect to work to its best potential. And there are a number of stupid-powerful combos for you to play with, that work out pretty equally.    A year ago or so it was just simply ""Load up the Red Son team"" and that was all the thought you put into it. Didn't have the Red Son team? Too bad, you were going to lose.

Obviously this is a joke as I know I have never cheated or even spent a penny on this game. I've been playing since it came out. Sometimes people accuse me of hacking because I have 26 Million+ credits, most my characters EVII Lv. 50. The most common reason is because my Ares and CCBG are EVII. I shall explain this as I have before. I got top 1% every MP Season for each. In the end I had CCBG and Ares sitting at EV Lv. 50 yet still doing really well in arena and such. I did however note that it's almost impossible to score top 10 if you don't hack or spend almost all day doing arena, so I messed around in the game and searched on Google for a glitch. I found one that allowed me to get the extra 2 more cards for Ares and CCBG respectively, allowing me to take them up to EVII. I always tell this story so I'm not accused of hacking, and I think I have a justifiable reason for using the glitch."

InjusticeMobile,3dg7l8,Zenima,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:22:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's a tough decision imo. With Raven, Luchador Bane, AO Bats, Shazam, and KJJ in the MW pack, more reason than ever before to buy it. However, FF has 3 awesome characters, and there's no risk of a bad draw because you know what you're going to get, and they are awesome.  So, comes down to risk versus reward imo. Are you alright with taking a gamble? Or do you just want 3 awesome units no strings attached?  Me, I'm just flipping a coin once I finally stop buying gear lockers and save up 400k. Like that'll happen before I evolve more gears."

Used a lvl24 E0 Batgirl, did 1300 something damage with her S1 without the Cloak and with Cloak it was 2600 or so.

She's more annoying than Raven and the only person who ever causes me to loose. I find constantly tagging my team forces KJJ to tag out of hit him with a DoT. Shazam uses his s2 more than most but it's often blockable. I don't mind playing Shazam teams as he's slow and predictable as long as you don't kill KJJ first, even then he rarely uses his super."

Another fun team is Team Lightning. It's quite fun and works well, especially after the buffs to Black Adam.   There are some fun themed teams to try out:   A fun team could be a Suicide Squad team, starring Deathstroke, Harley Quinn and Killer Frost.  The Legion of Doom team: Sinestro, Lex Luthor and Solomon Grundy(When you get him). Additionally, I think this team also gives you an achievement. With the new BvS movie trailer out, why not try the Holy Trinity? You can try the Teen Titans Team of Teen Titans Cyborg, Raven and Static."

Her necklace makes her special 2 chance at lifedrain which heals her. Also her special 2 is unblockable and her passive reduces enemy power generation by 50% which means your enemy gets off fewer specials thereby reducing your need to heal.

You WANT your enemy to hit you with their specials so you can power faster.   So instead of the Green Ring, go with Omega Battleplate. You get the increased blocking but instead of disabling you have increased crit."

InjusticeMobile,3d4we5,beomagi,2,Tue Jul 14 18:52:26 2015 UTC,"In my opinion your selected gears make matches too long.   I prefer hook and chain, hyper speed suit and bone spikes.   You can spam special one all day long and with the boost and critical hits you can deal major damage fast. Plus the bone spikes heal and produce damage boost when opponent is stunned after special one."

Hit tap slowdown isn't too bad, but it's easy enough to drop a special there.  His pause during the swipe/heavy attack is so long, I get my own swipe attack in there."
InjusticeMobile,3d5qpr,Thatguywhohasareddit,4,Mon Jul 13 19:05:48 2015 UTC,"So there's a few points to be answered, so I'll make a list.   Technically it's not heal regeneration, instead he heals himself for 50% of his max health when he delivers a knockout blow.  Regime Killer Frost's passive reduces her opponent's healing by 90%, so it basically neutralizes all healing. It's an extreme counter to Doomsday. Characters like Containment Doomsday and Prison Superman are not affected by Killer Frost Prime's passive because instead of healing it's health regeneration. They're small differences, but differences nonetheless.   Hope this helps :)"

The KF RKF combo is so brutal. Once RKF gets off a special your team will generate power 100% slower and you are royally fucked. Add WW600 or AniHQ who boost damage and power generation and the become unbeatable.

InjusticeMobile,3d611m,Metabeemeta,3,Mon Jul 13 20:16:53 2015 UTC,I take it as DoT itself does double bleed/burn/etc.   Prime Catwoman's Passive: Catwoman's basic attacks deals 50% extra damage against opponents suffering DAMAGE OVER TIME.  BR Catwoman's Passive: DAMAGE-OVER-TIME attacks deal 100% more damage for Catwoman and her teammates.
InjusticeMobile,3d611m,jedispyder,2,Mon Jul 13 20:24:19 2015 UTC,"From previous observations, the base damage of the DoT is doubled, any bonus damage (from hitting 200% on the attack) is not."

InjusticeMobile,3cvb4b,Greidam,5,Sat Jul 11 01:56:20 2015 UTC,"THUNDERCATS ARE GOOOOOOO!  At long last, I have conquered the fuckass decepticon that is my phone and produced the first in a series of videos that will hopefully both entertain and educate the members of this ever so grand community. All dozen of us.   Not that I think I know everything about this game, but few people have the time and resources to play with everything in this game like I do. So whether or not I actually know that much, at least you can see a large variety of teams and strategies tested out.   Now, since this is the first episode and it came after a long struggle with obstinate technology it is not up to par with my vision for the series. Not everything has been decided yet and I'm very open to suggestions and opinions. I'm considering doing voice overs to explain how the team was designed and works, but idk how much people want to hear what they can just read in the comments at the cost of my shitty background music choices. Also my editing style will inevitably change a ton as I learn to make non-epilepsy-inducing videos that are still quick and entertaining. Let me know if the speed is good, bad, whatever. I just figured that people would easily get bored since a long series of battles can feel sluggish with all the downtime and repetition in this game. My quest to produce the highest quality OC this sub has ever seen continues (not a high bar to reach).   As for the inevitable ""yo Greidam you flake, why haven't you finished your tier list? Your face looks like dandruff and I'll eat your puppy."" Well inexplicably hostile reader, with the cloak soon coming and changing up the entire meta, as well as my traveling for the next couple of days with only my phone to work off of, I figured I'd postpone the list and work on the series I can actually run from just my phone. For the first little while I bet I'll have a number of videos coming out as I have a ton of teams already that I can show off, and then it'll slow down as I run out of options. But more than showing off my teams I want to provide an opportunity to those who actually have a life and thus not everything in this game to see what it looks like when you do have it all. I not only am willing to take requests as to what teams or characters I feature, but I actually request that you request your requestions(wtf??)! This series is for the community, so I want to hear what you want to see from it!  Anyway, for the premiere of my series I decided to show off my most successful and perhaps popular team. I am still convinced this is the best team for offense currently possible, and hopefully these woefully lopsided matches will encourage you to agree. Averaging 25 seconds a game? Yes please.  Dubbed Lucy, I'm home!, this team focuses on guaranteed and swift destruction. Ares is pretty straightforward, ibistick and claws to make godsmack able to smack gods, and claws plus bloody sword for AOE and basic damage. With the next foe unable to block, BG is able to just mindlessly swipe since her heavies link into each other automatically, and then fire an S2 to kill the second poor sap. And then Lucy drops in to clean up the house before Ricky comes home. I picked this team for this episode because it's not particularly complicated, very cool, and quite unique. I hope you enjoy the video as much as I enjoy the team, and let me know what you think!  -Greidam"

InjusticeMobile,3cv7hx,kikesaltos,3,Sat Jul 11 01:23:11 2015 UTC,"Critical hits are based on critical percentage. All characters start with 0%. Oddly enough, if you use get to get up to 100% it doesn't happen 100% of the time. Rumor is that the critical percentage that exceeds 1XX% drops the leading 1 so you just get the XX%.   As for the damage, basic critical damage is 1.5x the normal damage. So 2k normal becomes 3k critical. Some abilities increase critical damage so 2k becomes 4k."
InjusticeMobile,3cv7hx,dreamerintherye,2,Sat Jul 11 01:30:10 2015 UTC,"Just quoting myself from a previous thread:   Crit chances aren't an additive stack, they're multiplicative -- so having three gears each at 40% crit chance give a ""real"" chance of 88% per hit (not 120%).

InjusticeMobile,3ct68y,Greidam,2,Fri Jul 10 16:34:22 2015 UTC,"I like your thinking, and I like the post. As for my input:  iBats is interesting because he would benefit probably more than anyone else from the cloak. The problem though is that he still sucks a lot, so with all the crazy buffs I think he'll only be ""passable""  I honestly hadn't thought of using Lucy's S1 in a cloak build, it has potential  Hawkgirl also has a lot of potential not just because of the rapid switch but because her updated passive also gives her double basic damage on switch it. So if you switch in and swing away they should take quite the beating.   The batgirl prime idea is pretty good except I'm rather sure that art of deceptions ""stun"" isn't an actual stun and thus the effects won't apply  One that I think I've only seen one person bring up (sorry I forgot who it was and can't credit you) is the upcoming Insurgency Hawkgirl. Her passive makes her S2 auto crit, she gets the 600ww boost, and her gear provides AOE on S2. It has potential to be real destroyer since it spreads the damage around really well.  One last one that's occurred to me as probably gimmicky but a lot of fun is simply put it on Ares with demon blade and bloody sword. It's far from reliable, but if you switch, stun, and get the crit on S2, he should remove about half of the survivors' health. That's effectively two characters worth of health (the kill and the two halves). Lots of fun, totally not viable."
InjusticeMobile,3ct68y,Greidam,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:26:03 2015 UTC,"The thing about Batgirl is thay you can't cancel that animation, so it's hard to tell whether or not it is a true stun. Nothing before this has given anyone bonuses for the opponent if they're stunned, you can't tell. The animation is the same as a stun and abilities will disrupt a stun, so until then we can't confirm whether or not it will work, that'd why this is purely theoretical.  About Ares, I have thought of that, but he is already godlike, so I tried to stay away from that in this list. I'm planning on testing him and ranking him on my next list.  Thanks for the feedback!"
InjusticeMobile,3ct68y,simulcat,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:41:40 2015 UTC,"Well I mean it doesn't say ""stun"" when it hits like all the other stuns and I'm pretty sure it still 'stuns' RSGL, but I could be wrong. I think it's just a unique incapacitation hit to keep them from blocking the second hit, which would be easy because it has so much lag lol"

InjusticeMobile,3ct68y,Greidam,2,Fri Jul 10 17:51:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, unless the Batgirl theory is right and it is a stun and a multi-hit ability receives the full 200% damage. In that case, CCBG is gonna be above S-Tier.   We're still awaiting the arrival of Bounty Hunter Lobo and Insurgency Hawkgirl, both of whom look promising. You may have to edit your list again."

InjusticeMobile,3ct68y,Mellakka,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:34:43 2015 UTC,"Haha I wouldn't be so sure about CCBG. Honestly her problem isn't damage. Not even close. They could make her damage infinite and she'd still not be S Tier I think. Her problem is actually making contact to deal that damage. Her animations are sluggish (that combo ended zomg), her passive actually makes it hard to switch in and launch something that would do more damage, her swipe has a lot of lag before it actually makes contact so it's easily blocked, she still doesn't have a solid one hit move to take out Raven, she's still not that bulky. I mean for a point of reference look at AOJ. He's far and above the strongest hitter in the game when paired with AnHQ. No one comes close by any measure. Yet literally no one would claim he's S tier. In fact, most people agree he's worst or second worst Arkham character. On paper he should nuke everyone, but in practice he can't deliver his nuke to the target as well as the other top tiers."

InjusticeMobile,3csuh3,gondi,5,Fri Jul 10 14:23:55 2015 UTC,"The sweet spot for gear is around +6 after evolving -- that's the point at which you've spent about 55% or so of the gear's total cost (that being the total cost of taking a brand new piece from never-been-fused to Evolved +10) but the gear's effects are already at about 90% of what they'll be when max'd out. Here's a specific example, quoting a post I wrote about this on the WB forums:   Keep in mind also that while the cost of each fuse increases exponentially, the benefit that you get for each fuse is flat. Meaning, for example, if you've just evolved your Alloy Sword into Promethium Longsword: if you want to evolve it from E to E+1, that costs 4 R and 4 G and gives you +1% Basic Damage and +1% Crit Chance. But if you've already got it E+5 and want to make it E+6, that costs 28 R and 28 G and but still only gives you +1% Basic Damage and +1% Crit Chance. And then from E+9 to E+10? Another 72 R and 72 G -- all for just one more +1% Basic Damage and +1% Crit Chance.  Therefore, the ""sweet spot"" is around E+6 or so -- at E+6, you've only paid a little over 50% or so of the total cost of full evolution (taking it from unevolved to E+10) but the gear's effects at E+6 are already around 85-90% of what they're ever going to be at E+10. So don't worry about going higher than E+6 until you've got a wide variety of gear at that level -- arming a three-person team with nine E+6 gears will be much more effective than having one or two E+10 gears and a bunch of crap in the other slots.   Also, if you're going for a healing gear, stick to the three-stars but, failing that -- if you feel you absolutely need to evolve a healing piece for fewer shard than the three-stars take -- then evolve a one-star piece... just don't evolve the Strange Elixir. When they nerfed healing gears' percentages a long time ago, the newly lowered percentages left the Strange Elixir/Lazarus Formula as the worst healing value proposition in terms of effect for the shards used -- see my lengthy write-up detailing the specifics here: https://www.reddit.com/r/InjusticeMobile/comments/2qy8f5/not_worth_it_stop_evolving_the_strange_elixir/"
InjusticeMobile,3csuh3,lahatiel,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:36:27 2015 UTC,"really great point u bring up. most of the time i fuse just enough to evolve. when one wins without straining oneself, there's no point fusing gear anymore"
InjusticeMobile,3csuh3,Aurora_Panagathos,2,Fri Jul 10 15:56:45 2015 UTC,"It drives me nuts to have all those +6 gears sitting around. I have five at +9, and I keep itching to max them out because it just bugs me to have incomplete gears... but while they keep throwing new gears at me, I feel compelled to put my shards there first. That said: if you're not an obsessive nut like me, I completely agree that there's no reason to go past +6. (The one exception is the Gauntlets of Azrael, since it gives you a lot more than 1% increases per upgrade. But you don't really need to upgrade that gear anyway, since there are much better gears out there.)"
InjusticeMobile,3csuh3,simulcat,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:32:38 2015 UTC,"really good post, thank you for it!  I did not know any of that before, but I have stopped at E+5 with most of my gears just because I can get by with those. Eventually I will (hopefully) fully evolve everything, but those pesky Green shards keep running out all the time!"
InjusticeMobile,3csuh3,Mellakka,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:37:47 2015 UTC,Man how didn't I read your post earlier? I just fused the Strange Elixir to evolved +10 out of boredom. 18% hp and 10% s1 heal costed me almost every shards I have.
InjusticeMobile,3csuh3,Hiendaoduc,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:52:56 2015 UTC,"thanks man! this really helped. Haven't really gone beyond E+6 on anything, but that's because i keep running out of those damn red shards."
InjusticeMobile,3csuh3,IronTitan12345,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:04:19 2015 UTC,"Like /u/lahatiel said, the set spot is the +6 level, since the cost sort of resets. Although with all of the new gear out, like Ibistick, GoA and Cloak, I think it's best to just evolve them to conserve shards, because you'll need them (especially friggin' red shards, those are like socks, one can never have enough). Once you've evolved all of them, then I recommend seeing which ones you prefer, establish your priorities, then find the sweet spot on them. Once you have all of your favourite gear at the sweet spot, then once again start leveling them up in order of priority when you're ready."

InjusticeMobile,3cqfj9,handsolo85,4,Thu Jul 9 23:10:33 2015 UTC,I'd just be happy if they made a bronze or silver Batman. Easily my favorite but why only gold?

InjusticeMobile,3cqfj9,jedispyder,3,Fri Jul 10 03:41:53 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying that at this point, most people who have been playing this game for any length of time wouldn't get much use out of new bronze or silver cards. All the new ones are gold because that is what most players want.    Why would I opt to play twice as many MP matches with a silver team? Unless the new cards are really unique and fun to play with in some way (I've seen the Adam West Batman idea pop up several times here...)"
InjusticeMobile,3cqfj9,CoalhouseWalker,2,Fri Jul 10 05:22:25 2015 UTC,I've been playing for 10 months or so and still like using Silver and Bronze teams in MP. That is where you get the most variety of team composition and not the same team 5 times in row.  Also new Bronze would help bring back Darkseid teams which have faded out of existence.
InjusticeMobile,3cqfj9,jedispyder,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:16:43 2015 UTC,"They could make an extra multiplayer mission for silver/bronze only and that would get some interest in those tiers. Otherwise, not much use for them like you said indeed other than if you like them or for challenges."
InjusticeMobile,3cqfj9,Feezbull,2,Fri Jul 10 13:13:47 2015 UTC,"That's already what the current challenges do. When you complete the whole ladder you win a bronze pack, a silver pack and a challenge character. You also randomly win a silver character in the middle of a ladder too.   .  But in all seriousness, getting some new silver characters would be pretty sweet."

InjusticeMobile,3cndk8,IronTitan12345,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:59:15 2015 UTC,"Ares, Batgirl and Lucy really is an insane team. My Ares is only E3 and it's still one of the easiest teams to grind multiplayer with. Much thanks for showing me the light, wouldn't have thought of it on my own.  Edit: Also I'm fairly certain the cloak was made specifically for Lucy. Can't wait for next week. I'm curious to see how the actual math will work with the increases to stun chance, crit chance, and total damage. I also run Lucy with demon cloak and blade, and each S2 generally runs around 150k depending on which hit falls in between a character being KO'd and the next one coming in. Not sure if the 200% damage against stunned will actually multiply all of that by 2, or maybe that will just apply to the first hit of his S2 chain. But even if it is just the first hit, 50% more damage on crit is pretty ridiculous. I'm guessing that alone will push his S2 into the 200k range."
InjusticeMobile,3cndk8,beomagi,5,Thu Jul 9 14:51:07 2015 UTC,"I mentioned this somewhere else on this sub; everyone is like ""zomg this gonna be cray on Lucy"" but really it's kind of a waste on him. I mean, he's already basically guaranteed a kill on switch. The cloak does what? Overkill damage? His S2 doesn't even hit multiple opponents. It'd be better put on a character who can turn their strong hits into OHKOs and likes to switch a lot."

InjusticeMobile,3cl9wf,Mellakka,3,Wed Jul 8 20:12:20 2015 UTC,"What does the cloak do?  Also, this season is 30 minutes old, and already I lost twice against a Raven/Killer Frost/Wonder Woman 600 team. I'm really beginning to hate this team."
InjusticeMobile,3cl9wf,UESPA_Sputnik,3,Wed Jul 8 20:33:33 2015 UTC,"Fuck, glad I am not the only one. Got smashed. Dam near break my phone when that team shows up. Fucking hate it."
InjusticeMobile,3cl9wf,kopkiwi,3,Wed Jul 8 20:37:37 2015 UTC,"I have a pretty good team (Barbara Gordon Batgirl as heavy-hitter, Arrow with some team healing gear and good special attacks, and Cassandra Cain Batgirl for quick attacks) but four out of five times I lose against Raven/KF/WW600. This is the only team that is too strong for mine. Whenever I see it coming up (usually as the final battle...of course!) I want to smash my phone against the wall."
InjusticeMobile,3cl9wf,UESPA_Sputnik,3,Wed Jul 8 20:46:26 2015 UTC,"I had Arkham Joker, Ani Harley and Arkham Harley. So a good 40% energy and damage boost to negate the slow regen somewhat, big health boost and I still got my arse handed to me.  KF and her passive are way too strong, it should be much less. Especially when you consider some the gimped as fuck characters.  Isn't it about time Prime Supes S2 was restored to what it was. Given that Ares has an S2 that can do 90k odd damage unblocked and they nerfed the shit out of SUpes when it was in the 50s, I think it's time to return it to it's former glory."
InjusticeMobile,3cl9wf,kopkiwi,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:56:43 2015 UTC,"90k, plus 18k damage to the other two characters AND makes the next opponent unable to block if you kill the first one.  I don't believe we should nerf, but I totally agree we need to buff some of the older characters.  Supes getting 50k unblockable is still laughable compared to Ares and everything he gets."
InjusticeMobile,3cl9wf,joncash,2,Thu Jul 9 04:59:28 2015 UTC,"Nobody on your team has a one-hit S2 that can take out Raven, so I'm guessing that's part of the problem. Here's a suggestion with that team: wait until CCBG has very low health, then unleash her S2 on Raven. Even if Raven switches health with her twice, it should kill her. The problem with that strategy, of course, is that CCBG is also your best chance at ending KF, but Arrow's S2 could do it."
InjusticeMobile,3cl9wf,simulcat,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:30:15 2015 UTC,"Barbara Gordon has a two-hit S2 where the first hit is strong enough to knock out Raven. The problem is that Killer Frost causes the power bar to fill up way too slowly, so by the time I've punched Raven down to ~25% my S2 isn't available yet."
InjusticeMobile,3cl9wf,UESPA_Sputnik,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:54:25 2015 UTC,"I can usually beat this team (upper 90% odds) with:   N52 Nightwing (Ra's, Eskrima Sticks, Gauntlets) Killer Frost (Thermafrost, Demon Cloak, Ibistick) K Lex Luthor (Mechsuit, Bone Spikes, Promethean)   It takes a long ass time (longest was almost 2 min) but it always gets the job done. This team synergizes awesomely if you're ok with a slower pace of play. Between KF's passive and NW's 2-hit combo ender + Ra's, none of your opponents will get an opportunity to build up to an S1. Even if they do, you have S1 drains on both NW and KLL. Furthermore, with KLL's passive and the Gauntlets on NW's 2-hitter, the entire team is now a tanky beast that will heal on every tap combo as long as NW is in play. Added to this is that KLL still has an S1 heal and KF has constant S2 lifedrains; it makes this team incredibly hard to take down.  Great for defense too; I had a 20/22 defense rate last season."

InjusticeMobile,3cn4ex,bruh_dinosaurs,2,Thu Jul 9 04:54:16 2015 UTC,This problem is common on iOS devices. It happens to me too. You can fix this bug by turning on airplane mode (or turning off  wifi and mobile data) before launching the game. When you reach the main menu you can connect to the Internet without the game crashing and play like usual. It works for me but doing that is bothersome. Hopefully they will patch this soon.  Hope this helped

InjusticeMobile,3cm0jl,IronTitan12345,2,Thu Jul 9 01:11:23 2015 UTC,Add Arkham Harley for the unblockable S2 and you have something of a cunt as a character.
InjusticeMobile,3cm0jl,kopkiwi,2,Thu Jul 9 02:27:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly with that S1 and gear you shouldn't be using S2 ever, 2 S1s will always be superior. But I do like Identity Crisis, I use it as the focus of a number of viable sets."
InjusticeMobile,3cm0jl,Greidam,3,Thu Jul 9 02:31:47 2015 UTC,Depends whom you're hitting. Anyone with a lot of gear and I bring out the heavy hitting S2 as it's easier to hit 200% then with the S1.

Don't get me wrong, the gear is insanely op, and will make any character ""good"", including Lucy, but he won't be optimal for it. Sure, he gets the extra stun on tag boost, but he might only have time to launch a s1 or s2. However on characters like Aods, abb, and ccbg, this cloak could be game breaking."

InjusticeMobile,3cjn5e,kikesaltos,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:46:56 2015 UTC,"I'm currently running this is as my main MP team:  E4 Killing Joke Joker - Ra's Scimitar/Mark of Lady Shiva  E7 Batman Prime - Batmobile/Nth Metal Morningstar  E7 Shazam - Ibistick/Trident/Demon Sword  I still don't quite have the best gear and characters, but I think this is the best team I can make with what I have.  I'll eventually replace Batman Prime with Arkham Batman and get better gear.  The usual plan is for Joker to do a bit of damage before he dies.  Batman tags in, fires off his nuke, and uses his invincibility to tank whatever special they have.  Shazam cleans up the rest.  If everything goes right, I can win pretty much any fight in about 45 seconds.  Some fights go a bit longer if they survive four Roaring Strikes, in which case I still have a full health Shazam and Batman.  The only weakness of this team I've found is that Raven can ruin your day sometimes especially if you happen to proc her passive on the last Roaring Strike."

Especially with crit S2 boost on AOB, you can either get Raven to half then use S2 or get her to 3/4 then use super. Do not use Shazam against her unless you have full charges from KJJ passive, in which case you can just tank her health swap with 1-2 S2 spam + heal on S2."

InjusticeMobile,3cjn5e,beomagi,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:53:01 2015 UTC,"Team I'm having a lot of fun with these days and can run through ultimate battles easily, is what I call, ""biggest headaches of the world's finest"".  I.e. Krypto Lex, Animated Harley, Arkham Joker.  Lex and Harley are pretty much a meta combo for any key character. The entire team gets  life, damage, power bonuses, with joker getting double from Harley.   In addition to theme, the team has power drain for stopping S2 starting attacks and generally keeping the team safe, absolutely vicious basic damage for dealing with power denial killer frost, teams, and Harley's S2.  My Lex and Harley are 50/7, joker is only 28/7. But I'm amazed at the damage. With 2 regular damage bonus gears and bone spikes, it's not uncommon to knock out 30k damage in one 4-spree. The damage is so consistently good, I sometimes just tank with joker to drop his hp again raven, and slash her letting her passive swap almost nothing. Only to have my pistol finish her off.  Lex - venom suit, energy lance, ra's Joker - 2x Regular weapons, spikes Harley - pistols, cyborg's armor, ibstick  Another combo I've been having fun with, is ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"" team. Black Adam and Static are incredible together. With life boosting gear/passives, Black Adam can really outpace characters in damage using him to take s1 attacks - his gear gets life back. Static is there when the shield is gone, making enemy damage his own. Works well with Luthor(s1 is counter though)/AO Harley for more life, or doomsday, who works very very well with static."

Super is loaded up with offensive gear (blade of war God, Promethean long sword, and powered eskrima sticks). KF is saved for the real fun.

InjusticeMobile,3clno1,square_root_of_jason,3,Wed Jul 8 21:40:20 2015 UTC,"Are there not enough posts throughout this sub to have it explained already?  Edit: Read this, there are links to gear at the bottom of the OP  https://www.reddit.com/r/InjusticeMobile/comments/2pisjg/new_possible_sidebar_links/"
InjusticeMobile,3clno1,kopkiwi,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:55:15 2015 UTC,"Gears are those things that give you the edge on a battle, mainly against bots or at multiplayer. They have various effects, and can be found on the gear lockers at the store or at multiplayer as drops or rewards. I highly recommend to start looking for healing or critical gears, since they are the most valuable for their effect. Gears have a initial bonus and a locked one which you unlock through upgrading and then evolving. 3 star gear have a character exclusive bonus, which most of the time is relaly fitting for the character.   To upgrade a gear you will need money, and shards (obtained through shattering unwanted gears). The proccess of evolving a gear (after 10 upgrades) is really expensive for beginner players, for me I invested first in getting EVII on my characters. It all depends on the gear's effect and your playstyle on how to use them."
InjusticeMobile,3clno1,Metabeemeta,2,Wed Jul 8 21:58:56 2015 UTC,"To add to that: Any time you have more than one copy of a specific gear, you can shatter the remaining copies. Also, once you have upgraded cards, you'll probably mainly want to use 3 and 4 star gears. Some people really like 2 star gears, but I don't really see the appeal. So I suggest focusing on collecting 3 and 4 star gears, and shattering the rest for shards.  The tough part is deciding which gears to upgrade. Some of the four star gears (Ra's Dagger and Ibistick/Mysterious Artifact) are great. For 3 star gears, focus on gears that go with your favorite cards, but also, as Metabeemeta noted, focus on healing and crit."
InjusticeMobile,3clno1,simulcat,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:27:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the comment, gyorfi. I know some people like demon blade. Personally, I don't find it worthwhile, but that's (in part) because I tend to have at least one character per team whose S2 is deadly. If your cards have weak S2s, Demon Blade might be worth it.  Personally, I can say that (1) Ibistick is much more worthwhile, and (2) I evolved Demon Blade, tried to use it, found that it was taking up a slot I could fill with a more useful gear, and regretted all the shards I wasted on it."

InjusticeMobile,3cj4hx,Mellakka,5,Wed Jul 8 09:01:48 2015 UTC,Last year my cousin (who is 36 and just had a son at the time) ask me if i was up on Injustice mobile. I said I've never really gotten into the mobile gaming thing b/c they just get kinda boring. He told me to DL it and I haven't been able to stop playing it since. I'm 29. Once a gamer always a gamer man
InjusticeMobile,3cj4hx,BBAMFCOAL,3,Wed Jul 8 12:28:41 2015 UTC,"29; don't worry about being to old to play this game. IMO this is the perfect type of game for people like us (aka people with responsibilities and commitments). I often don't have the time anymore to invest in RPGs, and I suck at all competitive games (fighters, FPS, RTS, etc) because of said time issues. But mobile games are simple ""pick up and play""; 5 minutes here, 30 minutes there. Just challenging enough so my mind doesn't go into autopilot, and it also feeds my childhood addiction of collecting cards without spending any real money."

Waiting for CDD and Harley to recharge now so I can be properly impressed.

InjusticeMobile,3cill8,Dark_Knight7096,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:46:25 2015 UTC,"He is pretty awesome and the fact that his passive kicks in at 50% health is a blessing. Unlike a lot of characters like Raven, u r sure to take an advantage of his passive. Also by the time he reaches 50% health the other 2 characters will have one bar ready. So imagine him using his special 2 and next you have AODS and AOB ready with theirs. one of the top characters of the game in my opinion."
InjusticeMobile,3cill8,monish15,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:41:09 2015 UTC,"I like his S2, but I can't get over Bane's fighting mechanic; he's slow, and his fist swinging is just a weird animation. And is it just me, or does he take longer than average to gain power (aside from his passive)? But maybe I just haven't figured out how to use him, and maybe the problem is that I'm using him in place of AODS, because I absolutely refuse to drop Joker from the team, as I love his basic attack."
InjusticeMobile,3cill8,simulcat,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:59:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not good at timing his heavy attack, but I have a blast with him anyway. I team him with AOJ and AHQ."
InjusticeMobile,3cig09,bruh_dinosaurs,2,Wed Jul 8 03:58:48 2015 UTC,"That's because it's an AI. The fight is just like Single Player, except you only gain tiny increments of power when struck and opponent's can have gear. You fight against the team that your opponent laid as his defense, but the fight is controlled by a bot. That's why the game is unaffected by pauses."

InjusticeMobile,3cig09,Dark_Knight7096,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:45:21 2015 UTC,"It's also custom characters.  You aren't just fighting the cards like in single player, you are fighting a pairing of cards that are custom selected by a user like you so the passives may work very well together unlike the SP mode, they can gear the cards to buff certain aspects of the character over others, etc.  It is AI controlled but it gives a whole new set of challenges."

InjusticeMobile,3cc6ds,Greidam,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:50:11 2015 UTC,"With that in mind, I have a question for you. I started playing again recently, and one of my better cards now is BRCW, EI level 50. I wanted the Femme Fatale pack, but now I'm learning that the Catwoman in that pack is not BRCW.   Would it make more sense now to save up for the Bleed pack so my BRCW becomes EII? Or should I just go for the Femme Fatale like I'd planned, even though that's 3 new characters?"
InjusticeMobile,3cc6ds,--quoth-the-raven--,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:09:22 2015 UTC,"Femme Fatale pack has Batgirl instead of BRCW.  I can't really make a solid judgement for you unless I see your full roster (not at all saying you should take a bunch of screenshots or anything), but generally I'd say Femme Fatale > Bleed Out, even in your situation. E0 Femme Fatale team is probably overall better than Bleed Out team E0, but with BRCW at E2. 600 WW's passive is incredible, Anim Harley is an all around very good support character with a passive that stacks very well with 600 WW's, and BG is on tier (based on stat total) with Supes Prime, BRCW is not iirc.  Femme Fatale pack team bonuses: Start with 1 power bar, +50% overall damage and power generation  Bleed Out pack team bonuses: In your case, BRCW will be your strongest card easily, but... Aquaman's passive is that his super does team power drain on opponents. Not as useful as it was before they nerfed the AI in singleplayer. Scorpion's passive is that he causes lots of DOTs, which admittedly does pair well with BRCW, but in the long run, the only DOTs that are worth anything are AO Joker's DOTs on a full AO team.  Femme Fatale pack team will be able to beat enemies that should technically stomp them just because of how many special moves they can put out. Add on the 50% damage bonus and they'll probably hit as hard as, if not harder than your BRCW. If you want, you can buy the Femme Fatale pack and replace BG with BRCW, sacrificing the starting power bar to put in your current strongest character. 600 WW can take advantage of BRCW's passive as her S2 does cause bleed.  Hopefully this helped a little. I mean, your comment is 5 days old at this point, I wouldn't be surprised if you've already made a decision on it by now."
InjusticeMobile,3cc6ds,grimvover9000,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:12:05 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for the reply! That really was very helpful. I've actually not made a decision yet because it's been tough to play the past few days, which sucks because that means the cloak is out of reach.   I'll definitely take what you said into consideration. My biggest dilemma is whether or not it's worth saving up 400-415k when my strongest character is only an E1. If I get the pack I probably won't be able to upgrade again, so I'm thinking it might make more sense to spend those credits elsewhere. But again, thanks!"

The turning point was when I bought a few gold packs, got lucky enough to get a couple of Doomsdays, then I saved up for the Red Son pack. Red Son pack changed everything. Honestly if I hadn't gotten the advice to save for the RS pack back when it was top dog (before even AO Bat existed) I probably wouldn't have about 90% of the roster at E7 level 40+ right now. It's definitely worth saving up for the themed packs if you can manage grinding out 75k a day. Just save that 75k instead of spending it on the discount pack. Guaranteed characters > random chance, unless you like Bane, Black Adam, and TT Cyborg."

InjusticeMobile,3cc6ds,Aurora_Panagathos,2,Tue Jul 7 12:56:36 2015 UTC,Cassandra Cain has a great passive that takes 25% of the current health of the opponent in play. So that's a very good aspect.   Haven't used the other batgirl but she's useful for an ares team or so or Shazam perhaps as well. One bar of power is nice to start with for a team.   Personally prefer Cassandra Cain for now.
InjusticeMobile,3cc6ds,beomagi,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:38:58 2015 UTC,"I use the normal Batgirl with KF and I put the scimitar on KF, so she starts with two bars of power. Then the other member of the team is 600WW and with all that power gen and 2 starting bars she's almost unstoppable..lol, Cassandra Cain is pretty awesome too though"
InjusticeMobile,3cc6ds,batfleck91,2,Tue Jul 7 14:43:14 2015 UTC,i prefer the redhead. i don't feel like 25% is a versatile passive. with redhead u can do all the cool stuff with aods and ares. my fav is ras on aods plus batgirl. end the game early

InjusticeMobile,3ccvmu,kikesaltos,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:34:14 2015 UTC,"I hace been playing since injistive came out on mobile. Until 2 months ago I had him in EII and was sure that anyone with EVII was a hacker.  I had gotten mine from either 75k packs or challenge packs, i really don't remember. I play enough to buy one 75k pack a day and for a long time never got one. So one day, after one of those double gold days I decide to buy 4 most wanted packs. Got 5 Shazams right there.  I was super lucky because I had most characters up to EVII and out of all of the packs I got, I just had one Batman prime and one Superman prime repeated. Every other character completed my elites.  Got 5 shazams, 2 ravens (the good one)  and 3 KJJ.  I already had AOB and AODS to EVII and that was the reason I did not consider buying those packs before.   Sooooo, buy most wanted packs."
InjusticeMobile,3ccvmu,beomagi,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:09:33 2015 UTC,"This. MW packs are not as efficient as daily gold until you realize how fast each possible character can get to e7. Buy one a week, and in a few months you'll have several e7s."
InjusticeMobile,3ccvmu,kikesaltos,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:51:40 2015 UTC,"True. If are specifically looking for a character like Shazam that can not be obtained otherwise, and in the gold packs has a drop rate so low. Looking for Shazam I spent everyday buying promo packs.  At some point I realized I had like 50 extra gold cards that I could not use to promote since they where EVII. Then is when I decided tonsell them all and buy most wanted packs and luckily got my wish granted.  I kept those gold ones hoping for the rumored EX upgrade. In the end it was like a forced saving.  I am not saying I only got repated cards in that time.  I was able to promote to EVII most of my characters, which was good too.  Now the truth is that most characters are worthless for everything but collecting.  So, should I start the game again, with my current experience I would buy gold promo pack every day until getting a viable team for MP. Then just go for more specific packs like the most wanted.  Actually when I started I early on realized and decided to save for the RS pack until all of them were EVII. Best decision ever. Then there where no other special packs. Right now I would go for the FF or AO.  But to promote Shazam,  the best is Most Wanted."

It's really only useful to get a few of the really rare cards like KJJ and Shazam, and even then at 600k a pack it is tough to justify purchasing it if you can't easily regain those credits.  Femme Fatale is the best value for power. I've never really used any of the characters in the Bleed Out pack, but I doubt they could match the FF characters."

Then you can grind another 200k and nab an EI. Femme Fatale is easily the most powerful out of the three packs. Most Wanted is good, but it's also expensive and can leave you disappointed. Bleed is fun, but not up to par with Femme Fatale.   That's my two cents, make of that what you will. Hope this helps :)"

Worked for me over 25 times on KF, AOJ and on AOBane.  Step to try to work around the reset-bug: 1. Close the app. I mean 'Force Stop' via the app details.     Use the 'Clear Cache' option on the same screen. This will help avoid resetting the challenge, as I'd imagine some important (and wrong) parameters are being kept here.   Relaunch the game with WiFi/3g/4g. Don't login to Google Play.      Please reply if this works for you."

You will still he out the energy/credits used if it crashed mid-match.   Not sure if this works for others, but I've avoided the reset multiple times this way. Also make sure you avoid playing the game offline. When you end up playing it online again that normally triggers the reset."

Here is link with the answers of many question you can be wondering atm. For a quick answer, gold characters are best, use your gol on the 75k booster pack you get every day and you will be able to climb up easily in the game, also, if you can buy the starter pack, it gives you  a good gold Batman and to silvers that will help you in early levels.

Other than them, just try to keep a small group of characters and spend money upgrading instead of buying more. It may not seem ideal towards the start, but having 3 Elite 5 is better than 5 Elite 2"
InjusticeMobile,3c0te0,Thatguywhohasareddit,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:55:37 2015 UTC,"The mechanics are better - deeper - than MKX -  you'll find there's 2 types of attacks (tap and swipe), instead of MKX where there's 2 attack patterns that alternate. This means there's more control over your attack pattern. I play MKX, and Injustice now, and I'm constantly disappointed over the lack of control.   Timing is easier when interrupting basic attacks with a special. It's easier to get gold in injustice to level a character than souls in mkx. Gear has no limitations in injustice as far as slot type - you can wield 3 weapons in injustice, where you can only have 1 in MKX.  MKX has an irritating mechanic where characters specials may not kill a character completely and leave them with a little life left - annoying when they can drop a special back on you in return.  Passives in Injustice are generally a little more powerful. MKX the passives are all over the place. Someone like silver Kenichi is easily in gold class range because of his passives when you take advantage of it. Frankly it seems the damage some characters inflict are also spread over a huge range in MKX.  Daily gold packs are great to start. When you start getting duplicates, and you evolve these cards, you can then look at specializing some - a character like doomsday can easily solo with a little passive help (he heals HALF his life on killing a character).  Gear is important. I'd suggest getting a gear pack every 2 or 3 gold packs. When you get far enough, you'll be able to afford a gold pack a day and then some. I did this on my second play through and when I had an E3 Doomsday, I just spend everything on getting him maxed out.  Certain packs are better than the daily gold - femme fatale is excellent, as is the red son pack - both give you powerful teams and they're worth saving up for."

InjusticeMobile,3c0te0,beomagi,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:37:34 2015 UTC,"Not sure. Save for your first gold(card).Then keep grinding. Battle 25(I think) and 32 are decent for gold early on. I'd say you can get through all except the last st if you grind. Save money for skipping a few battles there. It's not just that you're starting fresh, it's also that you're starting without previous experience so it's possible if you grind, and get at least one gold, and level him."

Get you more powerful characters, to help grind more gold or skip stages in the bane challenge. See how well you're doing with another gold. You may need to buy a silver or bronze character directly for the challenge.  Regime is ok. His stats are good, and S2 is unblockable, but his passive is underwhelming."

InjusticeMobile,3bwnf8,Childs_Play,0,Thu Jul 2 21:18:02 2015 UTC,"You mean 44+ right? From 43 to 44 you'll still get the same amount of xp in BB6. I usually level up my guys up until 46 in BB6, sure it is not as efficient anymore, but it's quite fast and you can easily beat BB6.  I think BB7 might be your best bet. I've heard people using E7 Raven to solo the first match and rinse and repeat that first match over and over. I also use ""Suicide Squad"" -method, so I just leave scrubby silvers/bronzes to die in the first match of BB7, gives you 1k more exp than winning BB6 matches. Not much of an improvement but a little bit.  Also, you could try MP. With E7 teams, you can get more than 10k xp per fight and you use only 2 energy."

I decided until just recently to buy the Arkham pack tomax out AO HQ and AODS, Im. selling AO Bats, since he is the weak link in the pack for me, as well as selling him making the pack 120k cheaper. I can manage around 2 packs a day with enough dedicated playing, o I hope it lasts until next monday at least."
InjusticeMobile,3bsw1k,tsuchinoko92,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:36:48 2015 UTC,"I have been one shot killed by AO bats so often at the start of a match due to him starting with 2 bars and being either slow to block or bad timing or just not expecting it, and you wanna call him a weak link? Im trying to get the pack because of how strong he is."
InjusticeMobile,3bsw1k,garthy1982,2,Thu Jul 2 07:49:51 2015 UTC,"Think about it. He unleashes a level 2, which is strong, but after that? He might as well be Prime Superman while he fills up his power, especially with AODS outdamaging so bad its not funny. AOBane makes for a better team player, since wailing on him gives the team a bar that cant be denied."

No Darkseid. Bought two challenge packs. Got AoDS and Boss Grundy. Decided to play with AoDS. It was fun, so I bought another Arkham pack. Got bored of testing out team, so played multiplayer.

InjusticeMobile,3buwng,darxide23,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:17:30 2015 UTC,"The target tap circles will add 25% for each one. For example, RSWW has two of them so you can get her to 100% + 25% + 25% = 150%. AOJ has three, so you can get 175%.  Not completely sure why it's this way, but that's how it is."

InjusticeMobile,3btd47,Perfectblood,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:42:39 2015 UTC,"thats a good team comp you have all are very strong with the right gear defensively but theres a few things you should know if you're trying to coast in to the like the top 1% without playing. 1 is you you need a team with high health stats. RKF does have alot of health but she not on of the original 3 magnets which are key to drawing fights. (shazzam, darkseid, GFS) youre team mqay surely have an over 50% win rate but i doubt youll draw lots of battles. another thing is you saud your raven is only eV. change her she to weak and wont draw shit. the magnet arent the best defensive fighters  but dont aim for 100% defensive win rates. try to just draw hundreds of fights because your bound to win some."

Her S2 is partialy unblockable (block breaker at the end of the frozen cone). Her basic tap combo is not at all a block breaker, just a two hit combo ender (juicy for Ra's).  Yes she's a beast but not that a beast : no one in the game has a tap combo with blockbreaker unless their sig-gear is giving it (Flash, Doomsday, NW and solomon).  Hope this helps."

InjusticeMobile,3bkzq9,Sabermawile,3,Tue Jun 30 02:02:54 2015 UTC,"–]IronTitan12345Must be an early winter. [score hidden] 25 minutes ago*  Come on, the passive is ridiculous. So as you get closer to winning the match this character gets less effective? Really ridiculous.  First of all, how is the passive ridiculous? Another way of putting it is he's more effective against higher hi although characters like Shazam and MKX Scorpion. The earlier the match, the more powerful he is. He bursts down characters effectively.    I have to disagree. Base damage 1100 is already very powerful against full health opponents. If that gets boosted even more by himself without gears, it'd be extremely broken.  For comparison, Ares stands at 1200 without a self-boosting passive. Deathstroke stands at 1326 with a self-boosting passive.  OP didn't state exactly how the boosting works either. So we'll have to assume that at no point in time, will this passive go into negative percentage due to his opponent's health. Neither did OP state what is the max percentage. A simple 25% boost will mean that his attack will rise to 1375, higher than Deathstroke's. We both know that OP probably have a higher percentage in mind.  We've already rendered practically all the pre 2.0 characters obsolete with guys like Raven and A Joker. Lets not go up another level in ridiculous power creep."

OP didn't state exactly how the boosting works either     He didn't state the specifics on how it works. Without details, it's hard to say whether or not it's op. It could either be calculated as a percentage of the opponent's current health in damage, or just increasing your base damage number based on their current health.    Plus, unlike AODS and Ares, this seems to basically all Red Hood's hot going for himself, unlike AODS who can easily achieve a 70k+ damage unblockable S1and Ares, who can get a 150k+ damage unblockable AOE S2. As long as his abilities are compensated slightly for his very beefy basic attacks, I don't see much of a problem, unless it's calculated oddly."

InjusticeMobile,3bkzq9,UriskLyErg,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:14:40 2015 UTC,As much a I hate to agree with android he does sound a lot like death stroke. The s1 is pretty close to death strokes pistols. The s2 I can't not imagine him pulling it off his back like death strokes s2.  As for the passive ccbg works with percent based damage cause its huge and immediate. This reduces quickly and is not rwally what you want. It's also not thematically very impressive. Revenge means you want to kill someone not go east on them as they get closer to death.

InjusticeMobile,3bkzq9,IronTitan12345,3,Tue Jun 30 08:12:34 2015 UTC,"Come on, the passive is ridiculous. So as you get closer to winning the match this character gets less effective? Really ridiculous.   First of all, how is the passive ridiculous? Another way of putting it is he's more effective against higher hi although characters like Shazam and MKX Scorpion. The earlier the match, the more powerful he is. He bursts down characters effectively.     Then all of the moves sound like a rip off of deathstroke.   Secondly, all of Red Hood moves sounding like Deathstroke? Have you seen Red Hood? He uses guns. So does Deathstroke. Oh boy, they use the same tools, better launch a plagiarism lawsuit.     Then, special two hits a ""fatal"" shot. So it kills the other character?   Thirdly, Killer Frost's super is described as deadly shards of ice. Last I checked, deadly, like the word fatal, means causing death. Killer Frost's abilities don't flat out kill the opponent either, and she's not the only one. Scorpion ""kicks the life out of his opponent."" Last I checked, a lifeless person is usually considered dead. Raven summons her father to end her opponent. That doesn't mean the opponent is necessarily dead. Arkham Harley's S1 says ""A toy weapon becomes lethal in her twisted hands."" Last I checked her S1 doesn't oneshot everyone. I suppose these characters are simply awful because their descriptions say they kill the opponent when they really don't?     It's as I stated earlier, just awful.   Yeah, good luck convincing people that."

Regardless of that, I think that this character might fit a niche that is exactly opposite of Boss Solomon Grundy's role. This character's stats are still really high so I wouldn't really say he finishes weak, but weaker than when he starts. I'm just going to go on a limb and assume that OP meant for the character to do additional damage added onto his base attack, so there's no negative percentage as the enemies' health shrinks.  Not saying that this is a good character, but its a cool concept and could work if tweaked."

More like a boxer that starts of much stronger than his opponent and finishes with equal offensive strength. How is that bad? If you insist that he ends the fight absolutely pitiful, then you should realize that he needs to be played differently. Just press your advantage at the beginning and then tag in someone else to finish off your opponent. Anybody who isn't terrible at the game should realize that's how he's meant to be played."

InjusticeMobile,3bhat6,arctic_ninja,10,Mon Jun 29 05:32:17 2015 UTC,"I agree with just about everything. Especially the Static plummet. Honestly I'd put him in Barely Viable now. He just can't do anything great anymore.   I think you're underrating AOJ a little, and AOBane a ton. I've been running both with Harley, and of course I've run both on a variety of other teams to test them, and while they don't have the universal utility as some of the other top tiers they are positively devastating in the right hands. AOBane especially is super slept on. When paired with ArHQ you can just open a match with her boost (Ra's + power gear makes it easy), switch to bane and gather power (he'll already be at one bar), and upon unleashing his S2 the opponent is usually weakened enough that you're GUARANTEED two kills in the course of one bane barrage. And then you leave him in, let him take a revenge special that won't kill because he has phenomenal natural bulk even before Harley's health boost, and unleash another free S2. That thing being unblockable, as strong as it is, with the timing and damage distribution that it has is absolutely broken. Not to mention that even if you slip up and bane starts taking heavy damage you get it for free AND Harley gets the power to heal him, all at once! I might make a post about the team with gears and such, but I want to test a few more tweaks and actually get Bane to lvl50 lol. Ya, he's guaranteeing me two kills in one special and he's not even maxed. Sometimes he gets all three if you time it right and have spread damage around enough. I'm currently thinking the border between A and S right now. On one hand he shouldn't be S because the other S tiers are brain dead easy to use and fit on any team, but on the other hand he is the only character in the game who can guarantee two KOs and possibly a third in just one special.   As for AOJ it's a simple matter of totally ridiculous damage. He is completely unparalleled in the damage dealing department. No one comes anywhere close in any category when he's paired with AnHQ. So while he's frail and has a near useless passive, it doesn't matter because your opponent is dead in two heavy swipe strings. I wouldn't say S tier because of inflexibility, but a veeery strong A tier.  I'm actually glad you made this post because the recent update shook things up so much that I'd call my tier list borderline irrelevant. I think I'll release an updated one soon, but I also really want to wait for the new lobo and Hawkgirl alongside the cloak of destiny because I think at least two of them will be total game changers (that cloak is way more broken than any of you realize. Also while I'm thinking about it: gauntlets of azrael actually kind of suck, they don't provide anything significant to any character that's worth that extra gear slot)"
InjusticeMobile,3bhat6,Greidam,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:16:43 2015 UTC,"Hey Greidam can you elaborate about the gauntlet.  I can't really put a finger on it, but unlike most of the community I also feel that the gear has only made team building more difficult.  It is so ""hyped"" around the community that I always feel like I have to include it on my team, but in reality it really hasn't made my teams perform better. For example, I still prefer my promethium ls/bonespikes/comically long pistol setup the ""ideal"" promethium ls/gauntlet/ra setup on AODs. Yet, still I feel like when I don't include the gauntlet I'm loosing something because they look so good on paper."
InjusticeMobile,3bhat6,zororod123,2,Mon Jun 29 14:25:23 2015 UTC,"I mean you said it yourself: it just doesn't add anything to most teams. Like, there's a cool visual effect and a bit of healing, but you need to have a real hard hitting combo ender to make it heal any significant amount. And if your character can hit hard enough to make it count, you'd be better suited just focusing on hitting hard because in this meta being able to last long on offense is just not a useful skill at all. Healing is more of a safety net these days since it's so easy to kill every team when the computer runs them. I don't even run healing on most of my teams anymore because it's less useful than added damage or crit. And the gauntlets are literally just a health boost and heal on combo ender so they provide nothing offensively. Huge waste of slot. Very underwhelmed. You shouldn't feel like you're missing out by not using them, they have a huge case of Shazam Syndrome (just coined that): because it looks good on paper and has some really cool visuals people think it's amazing, when in practice it's just completely underwhelming.  That cloak of destiny tho..."

I've been thinking about how to continue with it since I'm on the move right now and won't have my computer for a bit. Since the whole thing is so damn long I'm think I'll start separating each tier into its on post, and just linking them to each other. I also might edit the descriptions more heavily so I can make it recent without having to tack on edits and make them stupid long, but I'll miss the character the old descriptions have.  Lol ya red sons suck at the top level. I'd still recommend them to newbies who need their first gold team, but once you've started playing at the top level they really start to feel like a starter kit with nothing special to them.

It's a very easy window to land and I feel it hasn't changed her that much. It's also really easy to land because simply tagging in knocks your opponent down, opening your u lockable window, then if you have Hawkgirl the animation is easily long enough to tag out directly after your ability hits. She is hardly even fazed by the bug.  All of the Supermans (Supermen?), on the other hand, took quite a larger blow, especially RSSM. What used to be an insanely easy unblockable S1, and S2 for RSSM, got nerfed pretty hard. Add that to the lost."

The amount of work required to grind up only to get 3 characters who will be E0 is simply not worth it, especially when you can get 10 gold characters at the same price from gold boosters. This is much more cost effective for a new player.  Stick to god boosters until you can grind BB6, then save up for Femme Fatale packs or Red Son packs. They're cheaper than the Arkham pack and have great synergy."
InjusticeMobile,3bhi5f,IronTitan12345,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:09:32 2015 UTC,If you get the Arkham pack does it let you promote Deathstroke with credits?
InjusticeMobile,3bhi5f,Magic-Man2,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:39:31 2015 UTC,"No. You can only elite him with credits if you completed his challenge. If you were to max him out via Arkham packs, it would cost 6 000 000 credits, which I don't think is a task you're up for. For that price you could get 80 discount packs or 15 Red Son packs. To get a max Red Son team it would only cost you 2.8 million credits, which is much cheaper."
InjusticeMobile,3bhi5f,IronTitan12345,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:47:10 2015 UTC,how often do the red son packs come?
InjusticeMobile,3bhi5f,IronTitan12345,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:49:09 2015 UTC,"About once a month, I think, but I could be wrong. I haven't looked at anything in the store other than gear lockers and gold packs in a very long time."
InjusticeMobile,3bhi5f,ahbi_santini2,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:59:45 2015 UTC,"When RedSon was a permanent fixture in the Store (for about 1 year), it was the pack to get at the mid-level of play.  400k for the 1st or 2nd most powerful non-challenge team in the game (maybe 2nd to AO team).  I would get your guys up to E5s or E7s (I know direct purchase costs, but it cost less than a random purchase that is not moving you to your goal).  Grind level B6 or 32 (depending on what you can handle), and save $3.2M to E7 when the next time Red Son comes around.  Then you can grind B6 for the rest of the people.    Having E4 people or even E1 people doesn't help much.  Red Son gives you a strong team even if you only use 2 of them (the 3rd being a required character in one of the challenges).  By comparison the AO pack costs $6M to E7.  Also booster cards aren't worth it (aside from the AC ones) and the XP cards are certainly not worth it.  You'll get cards from the packs during challenge stages or the $75k Gold pack.  .  Before B6 & 32, the grinding levels are 25 and 18."
InjusticeMobile,3bhi5f,ahbi_santini2,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:04:02 2015 UTC,Should I just E7 Batman then?
InjusticeMobile,3bhi5f,IronTitan12345,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:59:55 2015 UTC,"I think Batman (Prime),  Superman (Prime) and Nightwing (52) are a decent Single Player team.  Leveled up to E5, E6, or E7 they will carry you to the 2nd main grinding level (32) and maybe to the main grinding level (B6).  Levels above B6 are hard for most ""good"" teams anyhow.  Then you can work on decent teams for challenges and MP.  For the first few challenges, your goal will be to beat the 1st level of the challenge to unlock the character.  Your goal will not be to beat nightmare level and get all 3 of the character (if you can, but don't expect it until your 3rd or 4th challenge).  My default Bronze/Silver teams are Flash, Nightwing and Lex (Bronze), Green Lantern (Silver), but that is a preference thing.  So, I would level up your Gold team to E5+ (whatever is needed to get to level 32.  Grind there and save.  When you're bored buildup your Bronze/Silver teams (or gear packs), but not too much.  Just enough to beat the Challenge 1st level.  Between the challenges and the Day 10 bonuses you'll get a ton of Bronze and Silver people eventually (not fast, but eventually).    Eventually, you can binge (E7) on a Red Son pack which will let you grind B6, dominate Challenges up to Nightmare, and get to the 5% in MP.  .  A few notes:   The secret to Nightwing is use the light jab to fill up his 1 power slot, and then power drain the other player.  Repeat, Repeat, and then repeat some more.  Nightwing isn't there for this 3 move (although if the opportunity presents itself). You need 5 good Gold characters to efficiently run 32/B6 (1 per battle) or else you end up waiting a lot to recharge your energy.  B6 is also very good to leveling people up to level 46 (pair a new guy with your dominating Gold guy) B6's 1st battle is a mirror image battle (same people as your team).  You can make this easier by using 1 Gold guy and 2 Bronze people. When starting out with gears, it is worth it to evolve a 2 star gear first (e.g., power gloves,  Mark of the Tiger).  It is cheaper to do that and almost as effective.  I wouldn't evolve all your 2 stars gear, but doing so for 1 or 2 gives you some decent gear at a low cost. Some say the Femme Fatale pack is almost as good as the Red Son.  I haven't tried them.  What you don't want is to have an E4 team of them.  Try to buy 8 packs at once."

InjusticeMobile,3bhi5f,2007rnc,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:52:42 2015 UTC,"Actually, one second thought that's a bit irrelevant. Get 75k packs, since I'm assuming your highest card is EI. This will either expand your roster or help promote your current cards for a low price. It's a cost effective way to get a variety of farming characters and eventually unlock BB6. Then you can be free to spend those sweet, sweet BB6 credits on whatever you please."

Plus, it was brand new gear.  But this season started concurrently with the AOBane challenge, so that drew some attention away.  Plus, the Batmobile's been offered before. So people who already have it are probably laying off.  As for me, I'm just wiped from last season.  I'm checking in a couple times a day to make sure I'm in the top 1%, and that's all I have the energy for."

Id go power gen and the revolvers on AHQ, so shazam's cloak, or the Arcane wand, Depends on what you want for the seconday effect, this will give you the maximum amount of specials on her which is the best part of harley. On 600 WW id probably, depending on what gear you have, I'd go Ibistick, kryptonian rifle, and then you could do a basic attack gear, or something else.

His S2 is a rapid series of strikes with his trident, whereas PA calls in a soldier to fight for him.

I can say that Bane's passive is a really good boost if you're getting a beat down while Batman's passive can make for an immediate K.O, Deathstroke doesn't provide too much unless used correctly. Unfortunately, I didn't get to do the AO Joker challenge so I can't tell you how he could be beneficial to a match-up with other AO teammates. All in all, it's a pretty good team."
InjusticeMobile,3bd413,BaconMagician,5,Sun Jun 28 03:39:51 2015 UTC,"AOJ is used at his maximum potential with 2 other Arkham characters. The increased DOT is really helpful for those heavies. He's more of a hit and run though, considering his health."
InjusticeMobile,3bd413,byBumi,3,Sun Jun 28 06:04:24 2015 UTC,AOJ is actually better with 1 arkham team mate and BRCW

InjusticeMobile,3bd413,UriskLyErg,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:02:00 2015 UTC,Honestly I pretend Deathstroke doesn't have a passive and just put power gen gear on him and spam his beautiful S2 that hits like 7 times.
InjusticeMobile,3bd413,2007rnc,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:55:13 2015 UTC,"I myself like to run AOBats, AOJ, and ArHQ. At the moment I'm trying to make a second team with AODS, AOBane, and an undecided third. AODS is the main damage dealer, while Bane takes hits and/or does some heavy hitting. DS and Bane compliment each other pretty well due to DS having a crazy S1, and Bane being able to supply another S1 to him when his health reaches 50 percent. Can be a really solid team. I might put AOJ in there for his DOT, or Harley for heal support."
InjusticeMobile,3bd413,byBumi,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:59:42 2015 UTC,AO Bane/AO Batman work very well together. I prefer something like AOJ instead of AOD so you can get use out of using Bane.

InjusticeMobile,3bb7qq,Abbhrsn,3,Sat Jun 27 15:52:03 2015 UTC,Likely working on getting AOBane. Now that I have one of him I plan to get back on MP a bit more this weekend. I'm just looking for the lovely shards to further fuse the new epic gear.
InjusticeMobile,3bb7qq,jedispyder,2,Sat Jun 27 15:55:24 2015 UTC,"The bat mobile is just such a niche gear too, all it gives on anyone other than batman is health and that's it. Not to mention super moves are generally a poor choice in multiplayer due to the blocking feature."
InjusticeMobile,3bbj6o,bballer4life,2,Sat Jun 27 17:18:38 2015 UTC,"Since the arrival of Killer Frost prime I couldn´t find myself not putting her into a team comp...she´s just freaking amazing. Same goes for Ibistick, the single strongest gear in game and by quite a large margin as well...  To the composition (Warning:Wall of text)  My main team:  1) AOBats (Batsuit, Demon Blade, Kama) - I find AOBats to be a really strong starter on both offence and defense. His stats are formidable. Gear-wise: Batsuit gives health and crit damage, not the best gear but still a good one. I optimise the rest of the gear to the role and bonus crit damage from the batsuit - demon blade in order to make S2 insta kill when not blocked with at least one crit. The kama is there since I want some crit chance on attack but I don´t find the diamond tipped suits (which give crit chance on attack and bonus S2 damage) as good since S2 already does enough damage and I´d rather have some more attack power.  2) Killer Frost (Ra´s Scimitar, Ibistick, Gauntlets of Azrael) - Queen of the show. Enough has been said about how wickedly strong she is right now. Double hit dombo ender, unblockable S2, S1 freeze debuff, great stats...and oh god that passive. I usually block and get an unblocked S2 with my AOBats and then switch to KF and finish the fight with her (when not facing Raven). To the gear - Ibistick is a clear choice on her for me, empowered specials, power generation and DOT on specials make it a pretty easy choice. Ra´s is an essential for me to go with Ibistick most of the time as it lets the character directly benefit from the DOT and empowered specials. For KF that goes double as much when you take into account her double hitting combo ender and her passive, she denies energy all day long. My last choice is a bit controversial - The Gauntlets. I used to have Venom injection system/superman battle suit for health+heal from special. The Gauntlets provide 8 percent more health and the on hit compared to the heal on a special. At first I didn´t like it but once I started using it I didn´t take it off ever since. The Gauntlets and Health+Heal on special gear is pretty much toe to toe, but the real difference is the team heal it provides (95 percent of the time). This made me decide for the gauntlets as they wouldn´t allow AOBats to use full crit damage boost potential and wouldn´t suit his role on my team.  3) AniHQ (Revolvers, Hyperspeed plated suit, Promethium longsword) - You can plug AniHQ into any team and she will pull her weight, she is just really versatile. With that said, her 20 percent energy generation (and the damage) goes really well with KF passive, making for a 70 percent energy generation GLOBAL difference between the two teams. She fills the role of support and healer with S2 on offence (and also finishing off pesky Ravens with S2) and is pretty solid on defense (though she rarely uses her S2, hence Hyperspeed suit). To the gear - Revolvers are an obvious choice for the team heal. The two S1 upgrades from them also help. Longsword is there just for the defense as it is better (from my experience) than the disc or health gears. Hyperspeed suit gives power gen and the crit on S1 makes your defense also easier from time to time.  Really happy with this team. I then have another team that I use for amusement when I get bored this one, I won´t go into detail - Raven (Demonic cloak, Ibistick, Gauntlets), AODS (Promethium longsword, Blade of the war god, Knife collection), AniHQ (Revolvers, Hyperspeed plated suit, Ra´s)"
InjusticeMobile,3bbj6o,Entaro_Thomas,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:36:56 2015 UTC,"My favorite is:   Killer Frost Prime (rags,ibistick,gauntlet) Animated HQ (Revolvers,ares' gear,kryptonian suit) 600 WW (Charged Disk, Sword and shield, Venom injection system)   I play it mostly just killer frost everything and heal if I need to offensively, and it's been pretty effective defensively im like 6/10 with it."
InjusticeMobile,3bbj6o,Tyler0314,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:21:19 2015 UTC,That's my team almost exactly. I missed the ibistick so I used mutated bone spikes instead. But this team is just way too powerful. KF prime clears teams on her own.

InjusticeMobile,3bbltv,CruxOfArgon,5,Sat Jun 27 17:42:38 2015 UTC,"Oh, man.   Gear   They added a series of Epic (4 star-5 star) gears to the game and are releasing them through multiplayer seasons the same way they did with the automobile. So far the released gears are: Mysterious Artifact/Ibistick and Gauntlets/Gauntlets of Azrael. The Cloak of Destiny is likely to be next.    Characters   They also added a few new characters to be released through challenges. Thus far, Static, Prime Killer Frost, Arkham Origins Joker and Arkham Origins Bane have been released. The Static and Joker challenges have both ended. The Bane challenge is live at the moment.    Packs   They added and cycled a bunch of packs in and out of the store recently including a Femme Fatale(all female character) pack which was very popular, a Metropolis pack which sucked, a Tag Team pack with Luchador Bane, New 52 Nightwing and Hawkgirl; a Bleed Out pack with characters who deal bleed damage, a Gotham City pack of Batman characters(shit deal, don't buy) and they brought back the Arkham Pack which is one of the best deals in the game next to the Red Son pack tbh.   Passive Updates   They recently updated the game and fixed a few passives that either sucked or were not functional. Batman Returns Cat Woman's passive was fixed, Hawkgirl's passive got a buff, Prime Bane's passive got a buff.   Bugs Unfortunately, their big updates came with more than a few bugs that have undercut the awesome additions. Here's a short list: no more chaining tap attacks into specials, challenges crash and reset often, visual bugs on heal and power drain from gear, and there's a few more I probably forgot.    That's the rundown of the updates. A lot of good, a lot of weak, overall it's been okay if not a bit rushed.   Edit: formatting  Edit 2: added Killer Frost to list of challenge characters"

Essentially removes the first combatant Batman Prime - Damage buff passive, S2 can potentially hit all three opponents between the four hits Red Son Batman - Good passive, works with Red Son team, fairly niche use Insurgency Batman - not very useful at all to me. S2 is pretty powerful for a single hit Batman Beyond Prime - broken passive, bad stats Blackest Night Batman - low stats, time-conditional passive, the only Batman I don't have (thanks, Android and your lack of challenges)"

GFSM and ABB were relatively recent challenge characters, from the last cycle prior to the current one, and it usually takes two cycles before cards get added to the Challenge Pack.

AOBane actually is perfectly suited for taking out multiple opponents with his high damage and perfect S2 which is unblockable when paired with ArHQ. AODS is arguably even better for it, but in all cases it's very luck dependent and you kinda need block breaker on it. Lucy is great for revenge as opposed to sweep."

InjusticeMobile,3b9q98,BamAlegre,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:05:49 2015 UTC,"Sort of. You must be logged into your WBID for your game to be backed up to their servers.  Then after every SP fight, MP fight and challenge fight they back up again. Keep in mind while playing Challenges, if you finish the final fight of a mode [normal/expert] the game backs up BEFORE you are awarded your 25 Challenge credits. So, if you quit the game before playing a battle you will lose your 25 challenge credits."
InjusticeMobile,3b9n9c,dasgwaks,3,Sat Jun 27 02:56:57 2015 UTC,"For a very long time I used a team of maxxed-out CW, RGL and RHQ.  I'd just use RDD, CW and RGL, they're cheap to max out if you just do BB6 a few times"
InjusticeMobile,3b9n9c,Rabid_Gypsy,3,Sat Jun 27 04:21:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, RGL, RNG and WW is a very good team. If you have, put blocking gear on WW, (preferably with crit on S1 like Omega Battle Plate), Ra's, Powered Escrima Sticks and Gauntlets of Azrael on Nightwing and basically whatever the hell you feel like on RGL.  Regime Nightwing is hands down one of the best silvers cards in the game, and WW's passive is really strong as well. Makes for a strong team."
InjusticeMobile,3b9n9c,IronTitan12345,3,Sat Jun 27 06:22:02 2015 UTC,"I used RGL, WW, andLex"

InjusticeMobile,3b9n9c,Sabermawile,2,Mon Jun 29 17:12:00 2015 UTC,"I am a personal fan of rGL, rNW, rFlash. I know most people will decry the lack of the popular WW and Lex for silver teams but this team is just so much more fun to play. NW starts off with Ra's, escrima sticks, and a heal on S1, Flash gets a heal, and a ton of damage buff gear, and I just load GL up with power gen gear. GL and Flashs passives mean you gain power at the speed of light and you're attacking at what feels like that speed too. NW with ra's and his power drain can keep enemies from even firing off a special and do some decent damage while he's keeping them down. Throw the flash out and get off a few S1s to boost his speed to lighting quick. Seriously. It's. So. Damn. Fast. With his damage boost gear he should be able to punch through anything in front of him in no time at all. If he gets low on health, GL's passive will be giving enough power to pop off a special and heal. GL just sits in the back and I let him build up enough power so I can use him as a sweeper or have a super ready if someone like Raven or KF comes along"
InjusticeMobile,3b9n9c,Mailcarrier,2,Sat Jun 27 12:57:09 2015 UTC,add Black adam to a team with RNW. Constantly draining power plus quickly charging that first special whilst adam is protected from those first three hits is awesome
InjusticeMobile,3b9n9c,pillarandstones,2,Sat Jun 27 13:39:59 2015 UTC,"If your primary focus is building a team for challenges, then I'd recommend direct promoting. Card packs are normally a good choice for long term, but they're too random to be of use for an immediate stronger team.   I had to do the same thing to get through Nightmare Silver challenges, promoting my RGL to EV. On that note, don't assume you need all EVII cards. Now, obviously, gear is HUGE here (esp Heal on S1) but my Silver challenge team consists of EV RGL, EI IHQ and EII LL, simply as they are my best Silver cards. Works great and has gotten me through multiple challenges."
InjusticeMobile,3b9n9c,wood33430,2,Sat Jun 27 17:24:44 2015 UTC,Pick up Regime Flash and stick him with Green Lantern and Nightwing.  Thank me later.
InjusticeMobile,3b9n9c,darxide23,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:33:43 2015 UTC,"I use RFlash, RGL and RNW a lot and can win most MP matches I play with them. It's more fun than a high level gold team as you don't even up fighting the same 3-4 cards over and over again. (Still see them but not as much) They are fantastic. WW and GA are good too but I don't currently have them at E-7 so I don't use them as much. What ever team you go with RGL is a must as an anchor since his passive is one of the best in the game.  Catwoman seems squishy to me and Doomsday is slow so I don't like using him as much."
InjusticeMobile,3b9n9c,Doright36,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:01:22 2015 UTC,"Silver black Adam has the highest silver damage. Then I just slap on regime Green Lantern and Regime Flash and watch the death count add up. He's worth the investment 100% otherwise, pick your strongest guy and gear him up with basic attack gears to wipe the floor with your enemies"
InjusticeMobile,3b9n9c,2007rnc,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:42:20 2015 UTC,"Upgrade GL, WW, and NW directly. That team (potentially with Flash replacing Nightwing, although that's personal opinion) is the best silver team."

InjusticeMobile,3b6xef,Gawdzillers,2,Fri Jun 26 19:09:01 2015 UTC,Mr Mxyzptlk possesed The Specter and was protecting Superman from magic.  Constantine and Batman kidnapped Raven and made it look like Superman did it to turn Trigon against Superman.  Trigon attacked Superman and Mxyzptlk started battling him.  The battle was going to tear earth apart to Dr Fate transported everyone to a dimension that existed outside of reality and the battle was threatening to drag everyone to hell.  That spiraling is just an artistic representation of the magic being traded back and forth.

InjusticeMobile,3b3vmp,NateGT86,6,Fri Jun 26 01:10:13 2015 UTC,Nope. Not everyone has time to spend hours grinding for challenge credits and then completing the challenge 3 times.
InjusticeMobile,3b3vmp,RevGrimm,3,Fri Jun 26 01:50:48 2015 UTC,"Oh I definitely agree there. That being said, when you finish the challenge in a short time it sucks waiting over two weeks for it to end."
InjusticeMobile,3b3vmp,0376957,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:32:53 2015 UTC,Same glitch as previous challenges? Need to know so I don't take my tablet to work and lose my progress.

InjusticeMobile,3b3vmp,D_Gibb,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:53:00 2015 UTC,"Try this:  Read this post.  Worked for me 5 times on KF and twice now on AOJ:  Step to try to work around the reset-bug: 1. Close the app. I mean 'Force Stop' via the app details.     Use the 'Clear Cache' option on the same screen. This will help avoid resetting the challenge, as I'd imagine some important (and wrong) parameters are being kept here.   Relaunch the game with WiFi/3g/4g. Don't login to Google Play.      Please reply if this works for you."
InjusticeMobile,3b3vmp,60daysNoob,3,Fri Jun 26 14:03:49 2015 UTC,I will try this -- after I use the glitch to my advantage to get EVII AO Bane.
InjusticeMobile,3b2kda,astrospeedyj,3,Thu Jun 25 13:30:26 2015 UTC,I like the breakdown of different gear combinations but I don't think the gauntlets are ideal for Harley. She doesn't have enough damage from her basic combos to make an impact. The gauntlets seem to be made for deathstroke. He's the only one with a crit booster/dmg gear
InjusticeMobile,3b2kda,Tuldoka,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:20:13 2015 UTC,"The idea wasn't to find the ideal combo for her, obviously there are better ones, I just wanted to show what she could do with the Gauntlets."

InjusticeMobile,3b2kda,AvengeTC,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:46:03 2015 UTC,I feel like the Harley setup is kinda weak because 1. She only has 1 hit on her combo ender. 2. She does not benefit very much from Ibistick’s special2 bonus damage. Is it really worth giving Harley 2 legendary gear when she is only able to use half their potential?

InjusticeMobile,3b3rmb,CoalhouseWalker,2,Thu Jun 25 20:32:32 2015 UTC,"Heh sorry, it was more his combination of gears.  He's basically put 450 worth of gear.  One of which he doesn't even get full value on since ra's dagger won't give him an extra bar of energy.  It's a bit over kill."
InjusticeMobile,3b3rmb,Feezbull,6,Thu Jun 25 20:50:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, definitely inefficient use of gear. Just like the Batman cards geared with his suit (which gives bonus damage on crit) but no gears for crit chance, but they'll still have Ra's and the Batmobile.  Maybe they thought they'd be able to start with 3 bars and get off that super right away?"

InjusticeMobile,3b05sj,DEADP00L_,6,Wed Jun 24 22:20:57 2015 UTC,"The reason you never have the shard you want is because the shard you want is the one you use the most. The cost of fusing goes up exponentially with every level, so the more you fuse a piece that takes red (or blue, or green, whichever), the more of that shard you use -- so you burn through that one faster.  Take Scorpion's Kama -- a popular piece to evolve. Getting it from unfused to the evolved state takes 183 red and 107 blue (plus the 5 green and 3 purple for the Evolve step itself). So now you keep fusing it. +1 after evolution takes 5 red and 3 blue. Then +2 takes 7 red and 4 blue; +5 gets up to using 25 red and 15 blue for that one step, and so. You'll just use more and more of that primary color as you go, which makes it seem like red is ultra-rare because you're burning through so many of them so quickly. By the time you've max'd the Netherrealm Kama at E+10, you'll have used a whopping 550 red in total, to just 327 blue plus those 5 green and 1 purple.   Complete step-by-step fusing costs for every piece is available here on the Gear Fusing Costs tab: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11Dhxw7EGbkMLKBrhOxocT3rrgX37ndzT2pz8D5sZA-E/edit#gid=11 and the Gears tab also shows what you'll get for shattering all the pieces."
InjusticeMobile,3b05sj,lahatiel,3,Wed Jun 24 23:19:29 2015 UTC,"And as the chart shows, some gears have balanced shard costs between the two colors needed, rather than the primary/secondary costs like with the red/blue in the Kama example above. But that still just means that you'll be blowing through those two colors without touching the third -- if you've got 484 red, 41 blue, and 40 green like /u/matulaak7 has in their reply elsewhere in this topic, I'd bet they've been fusing one of the Bone Spikes/White Cloak/Yellow Power Ring trio, each of which will end up taking a total of 441 blue and 441 green to get to E+10, but only 5 red and 3 purple."
InjusticeMobile,3b05sj,lahatiel,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:23:54 2015 UTC,Yeah I got bone spikes and white cloak evolved :) All the gear I've chosen to upgrade never uses red and all the gear I shatter gives me red. That's why I have so many. It keeps stacking with no way to go down.

There's absolutely no synergy, but I like playing as each of these characters and the way I have them geared, they each have their own role on the team. CSDD - Tanks for days; MKS - So much damage; Raven - Damage and stalling (and now team heal with the new gauntlets)"

He looks badass, I find his heavy combo easy to juggle, I like having a character around that has a really strong one-hit special (like his 2nd) to help bypass X% health left passives (Raven's, EF's, JSGL's, etc.), and it's very convenient that on top of all of that his sig gear gives him both a heal on Sp1 and a chance at unblockable basic attacks (in addition to increasing basic damage); makes adding a 2nd & 3rd gear feel more flexible (since so many nice perks are already on his own gear)."

SG and Super-slow aren't my favs either.  although gfS isn't too bad, because he has the blocking thing, that makes up for his slowness and rsS is good cuz he can hit like a truck(even though they nerfed his S2). i tend to favour KF, because she can still chain attacks together, BG, and ewF because i like their passives. i even like playing with iBatman every now and then.

InjusticeMobile,3axhev,matulaak7,3,Wed Jun 24 07:54:21 2015 UTC,"Godfall Superman, Darkseid, and Shazam are staples in 'magnet teams'. I'm currently sitting in the Top 5% with 140/651 battles this season with an RKF/Shazam/KF team.  I'd say your best bet is the two Killer Frosts plus Godfall Supes or MKX Scorpion, thanks to their high health totals.  Gear is a factor, too, so try to accrue the highest gear score you can--even if the effects aren't actually useful (i.e. the Batmobile)."
InjusticeMobile,3axhev,godsavant,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:13:15 2015 UTC,This is the kind of reply I was looking for. I already have GF Supes and RKF at Lvl50 EVII. My Killer Frost card is Lvl50 EII so it wont be too hard to get 5 more copies.   If you are getting this many defensive battles with that team I am definitely going to go out of my way to set it up so I can do the same.  Thank you for the reply
InjusticeMobile,3axhev,godsavant,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:25:17 2015 UTC,"Of course. Also, be aware that your Defense battles won't start showing up in your record until you finish at least one Offensive battle that season, but you'll still gain the Battle Points from them."
InjusticeMobile,3axhev,CoalhouseWalker,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:06:00 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty good pull there - This has been my best defensive season, pulling about 90 matches with about 50 of them won.

If you play a MP match, doesn't the game just pair you with someone else who is doing the same level match (in which case, nobody is actually ""selecting"" you specifically).  I'm just not sure how a defensive team should be chosen, aside from which combination of characters is strongest."
InjusticeMobile,3axhev,godsavant,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:51:23 2015 UTC,"Not exactly; not to blow your mind here, but in Online Battle the AI is controlling the enemy teams, not real people.   When you press 'Find Opponents', the game chooses your opponents based on health totals. For example, in a 7-round Ultimate Battle, your first enemy will be slightly weaker than your own team, while your seventh final fight will be more tanky. In the realm of EVII Lvl.50 cards, Battle 7/7 will almost always be against some mixture of Darkseid, Shazam, or Godfall Supes--even though cards like AODS or Ares are ""stronger"" choices and would win more, they have lower health, so their teams don't get chosen as opponents as often as these 'magnet teams'."
InjusticeMobile,3axhev,--quoth-the-raven--,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:58:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the explanation. I knew MP matches weren't against live enemies, I just wasn't sure how the game matches teams up."

InjusticeMobile,3axhev,mikeyflems,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:05:13 2015 UTC,"I've had a great defensive season with Raven, CDD, and JSGL.

InjusticeMobile,3axhev,wood33430,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:23:43 2015 UTC,I was asking more about attraction over strength. Such as how many battles a team faces each season.  How many defensive matches do you face Avg a season with this team? 2/3 sounds like a great win ratio but if its over a total of 15 or 20 matches it really isn't worth it for me to get JSGL evolved 6 more times.   I have heard that some people with the right teams face upwards of 50 matches a season. That is a number that I would like to emulate.
InjusticeMobile,3axhev,godsavant,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:00:15 2015 UTC,"My defensive team of EII CDD, EI Ares and E0 AOB is sitting at 27 / 43 for this season, with most of those losses being from high ranking revenge matches. Not a bad ratio and number of wins, but not the hundreds of matches that some get at high EV levels with Shazam, Darkseid and GFS.   My point is, if you don't land on a good EVII team, you may be able to achieve decent results with your lower E level cards if teamed well together."

InjusticeMobile,3av5c4,beomagi,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:43:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, he does, but you have to be pretty low.  As your health goes down, the numbers will pop up: 2x damage, 3x damage, 5x damage, 10x damage.  I cant give you exact percentages on when you get to each boost, but JSGL's barrier seems to kick in somewhere after you get to 5x and before 10x.  So 10x is really really low.  Unless the opponent is wide open, I don't even bother attacking when I see the 10x.  I just tap a special to heal or tag him out."
InjusticeMobile,3av5c4,capitantelescopio,3,Tue Jun 23 23:08:22 2015 UTC,It's a great team! I have always wanting to use Boss Grundy efectively and this seems to be a pretty good way. Also I have one question regarding CCDD and JSGL's passive. When does the green shield activates? The first time DD gets to 10% health or the last time it gets to 10%?
InjusticeMobile,3av5c4,myster5,2,Tue Jun 23 21:16:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks! JSGL's passive kicks in the first time CDD gets to 10%, which is not ideal, but it does extend his lifespan somewhat."

Someone who can really put the life bonus to good use.  Raven can definitely make use of it. She has good damage, but she doesn't have to carry the team with it alone. Extra life and healing on her just make her sicker. She does hit twice on her ender.  That said, Nightwing and Deathstroke are obvious choices if you're willing to sacrifice damage. They're already prime choices for Ra's (for power denial) so the next question is would you use both on the same character?  Given that there's only a few multi hit combo ender type fighters, it might make sense - sacking energy from the enemy is arguably more important. That said, it will have to be seen exactly how much health can be leached back compared to current heal gear. If it's actually significant, then your last piece can go full on damage."

This is effectively a 100% power gen difference between the two teams.   The team's pretty meta at the moment, and is my go to team for defence and offense.  EDIT: Plus gear, like KF's thermafrost necklace, which also provides power gen. In a typical game against an opposing team without KF, I get to my S2 within about two light tap combos."

InjusticeMobile,3avgcn,Xicoro,2,Wed Jun 24 02:03:19 2015 UTC,"I would probably switch out one of Joker's gears with a S1 heal both to take advantage of the power gen from his teammates, plus make him more durable. You could go for one that has a health bonus to make him even more durable (and to heal more per S1), or put bone spikes/knife collection to ramp up his basic damage, since it sounds like he's going to be in play 80% of the time.  Also, RGL has a great passive but doesn't stand up to maxed gold characters whatsoever. I haven't tested the team so that may be an irrelevant fact, maybe not, depending on how much you need GL to absorb damage.  Other than that, looks pretty good!"

InjusticeMobile,3atjsp,PotatoPrinter,5,Tue Jun 23 11:52:25 2015 UTC,"Crit chances aren't an additive stack, they're multiplicative -- so having three gears each at 40% crit chance give a ""real"" chance of 88% per hit (not 120%). See my replies in this thread for the detailed explanation as to how it actually works: http://www.reddit.com/r/InjusticeMobile/comments/307gxa/do_gear_affects_stack/"
InjusticeMobile,3atjsp,lahatiel,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:22:54 2015 UTC,What about crit damage and heals on special moves? Are there any caps on these bonuses?
InjusticeMobile,3atjsp,lahatiel,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:19:29 2015 UTC,"Crit damage boost, no -- anything that's just an ""adds X% to a number"" (rather than ""X% chance of something happening"") just stacks as an additive, no cap. But for ""Heal X% on Special Y"", only one works at at a time -- if you gear the same card with both Mutated Bone Spikes and Venom Injection System (both Heal X% on Special 1), or both Kryptonian Battle Suit and Martian Hunter Garb (both Heal X% on Special 2) , you'll only get one's Heal effect for the same special -- ""Heal X% on Special Y"" is the only gear effect that doesn't stack for the same special (i.e., you can't use two """"Heal X% on Special 1"" effects, but you can give one character both ""Heal X% on Special 1"" and ""Heal X% on Special 2"")."

I was playing as TTCyborg (using Ra's gear) and it happened for about 50% of my combo finishers. They got off an unblocked Special where I was supposed to be draining their power so they don't get to use said special. (And it doesn't drain power afterwards, even through it shows the animation.)"

There are a couple others you can special attack through and some you can basic attack through. I keep a list for what's punishable even when in hitstun."
InjusticeMobile,3arlil,UriskLyErg,2,Tue Jun 23 02:44:19 2015 UTC,"There's a current 'glitch' where you can't attack until the previous animation is completed, whether it is the end of one of your own attacks (i.e. breaking the WW S1 chaining).   but this also applies to someone attacking you under certain circumstances. For instance, I've been playing as Killer Frost, and I will have to wait for my frozen/slowed down opponent to finish their normal attack and return to resting position before I can attack. I've noticed this mostly against Shazaam, since he comes up a lot in MP (this isn't an issue against Darkseid or Deathstroke, other characters whose swipe attacks are easy to punish). This can also interfere with blocking immediately upon tag-in as well. I've gotten hit with a few unblocked Winged Avengers this way, when trying to swap in and block with my tank."
InjusticeMobile,3arlil,myster5,3,Mon Jun 22 23:22:26 2015 UTC,"Ugh, I hate the ""cool down"" before you can block for some characters.

InjusticeMobile,3ar8ok,TheFrenchTinkler,3,Mon Jun 22 21:25:55 2015 UTC,the dirty little secret about defense teams:  Lower Elite[E0-EIII] Defense teams  with good gear will get more victories than EVII teams with good gear.   Notice almost every time any one posts their Best defense team they leave out what promotion level they are at.

Both high damage and health, making him useful for bb7 in dead zones. In MP he can be a bit of a bitch equipped with Ra's scimitar and his own gear, though playing with him is a pain because he's really slow. People use him on MP because of high stats attracting more hits. (A couple sessions ago a team of e7lv50s raven, gf, kf attracted hundred of battles with an upper limit of 1600ish) however for some reason this team doesn't get as many hits as it used to so a lot of us on the wb forum are putting different together to try to find teams that attract hits.

This sounds easy on paper but in reality you'll have to be smart with your switching in juggling, saving that special for when raven switches in. Another strategy is to fight her with a character that already has been damaged,  minimizing the health she gains. This is pretty general advice and I could help you more if I knew your team."

InjusticeMobile,3aqh7m,Vizitigre,5,Mon Jun 22 18:18:52 2015 UTC,"Regime Superman has an unblockable S2.  Now you're going to have to do some math since I can't see your card, but figure out how much damage your S2 does vs how much health Raven has, and use the S2 when her health is at the right spot. If you have a hard time calculating her health, just hit her until she has ~5 notches of health left, then S2.  Your only other option is to charge up to Super with either AOB or Shazam, which would probably be easier with AOB considering he starts with 2 bars.  The key to the whole thing is to take it easy and play it smart, and you'll never have to worry about Raven's passive."
InjusticeMobile,3aqh7m,mymamaalwayssaid,2,Mon Jun 22 18:48:10 2015 UTC,"If possible I'd switch out one of those characters for someone with a strong 1-hit s1 or s2.

InjusticeMobile,3aqh7m,jedispyder,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:33:04 2015 UTC,"I make sure to get her HP down to just the tip of the bar above the health meter, which is usually about 12% or so. Regime Superman's S2 should take her out easily."

Regime Superman has an unblockable S2.   This is your best bet besides saving for a super. Superman's S1 is strong enough, but you'll have to time it much better, since you're not guaranteed unblocked and you'll really need to be close to that 25% mark.  Also, level up your rSM's S2 so it will do maximum damage each time you use it. This is key. Using this method, killing Raven should be no issue."

Harley's S2 bomb is made to take out Ravens.  It's unblockable and a fully maxed S2 harley dishes a minimum of 30K something for the bomb, so you should have no issue with it.  Running 600WW with AniHQ Ibistick +1 or +2 on HQ & selecting a Joker damage boost on S2 give her S2 bomb 59866 unblockable damage, without the Ibistick & Joker boost her S2 bomb is still high 30s.  I will wear raven down with WW until she's got about 25% of the bar left, bring Harley in and bomb, done, nothing to worry about."
InjusticeMobile,3aqh7m,daxel123,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:42:09 2015 UTC,"Also Ares S2 can knock her off pretty quickly, or build up a character to S3 by tap attacking, not heavy swipe, and finish her off.

InjusticeMobile,3aqh7m,Devlyn16,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:53:25 2015 UTC,"health bar is segmented. 4 of those segements = 20 % the point at which raven swaps health. you need to beat her down to that point and then hit her with a 1 shot [S1 or S2] that does damage in excess of her 20 % health.    Prior to starting the battle click on her card to see her health, and what gear she has as gear that boosts health is not reflected in the total health listed. for example if her health is 60K and she has Superman's gear for a 20% health boost she actually has 72K health 20 % of which  is 14, 400. so your unblocked Special needs to hit for Greater than 14,400 in this example. Otherwise the best thing is to get her between 40 % 40 % of her health and unleash a Super move"

InjusticeMobile,3ao2er,Sgt_BigMac,6,Mon Jun 22 02:32:41 2015 UTC,No. It's a bad idea in terms of game play.  Newer players are rewarded and older players are punished. It makes certain golds warp the meta even more and ruins defensive teams and how much BP they get. The current tier system is good. Rewarding god players and still letting new players do well if they put effort in.
InjusticeMobile,3ao2er,UriskLyErg,2,Mon Jun 22 03:38:07 2015 UTC,"If u think it'll help the new players, u're horribly wrong.   How does this help to bring balance for the newer players?Stronger players with gears will always get more points considering they always finish match faster(less knock out on your team) and heal up. My point is stronger players can(and will) perform better in matches as compared to newer players which ironically brings about a bigger point gap using your idea."
InjusticeMobile,3ao2er,iLikeKopi,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:23:46 2015 UTC,"When ibistick was an event it took a lot to get it in terms of score and teams I used (Barely made gold). Now in the gauntlet event (I focused on promotions and bb6 grinding in between) I have only 4 teams and I am in the top 1% with over a 1.5 million score.  I like this idea as it helps out the little guy, but at the same time you can have a bronze team at the top since everyone is scored the same way. It helps the beginners, but for the people who work hard and grind, it all becomes useless since you are on the same scoring level in mp. Plus with multiple teams, you could pretty much grind mp and be all at the same scoring rate if you play your teams right. I like the idea since it would balance everyone out, but new players could get as high as some of those who have played for years."

I dont think bronze and silver fights should be penialised as much by getting so much lower points for fights, a silver or bronze fight can be just as hard to win as a gold one or sometimes harser yet you get a lot less points for it :-/ this beings new problems, that gold is hars to obtain because you get barely any in MP and I don't have the characters to grind offline for gold and to play online to get gear :-/"

The better characters are way less common. Some of them have passives that aren't worth 600 thousand, and some of them can even be bought in the store. Although some are worth the gamble cough Raven, the chances are slim when only buying 1, and getting guranteed characters that are really good (aods' sp1 is arguably the best in the game, ArkH is a good support, and AO Batman to top it all off)  although there are a few diamonds in the rough, it may not be worth the gamble in the end.

InjusticeMobile,3am7ad,icouldgetofftothat,8,Sun Jun 21 16:25:08 2015 UTC,"I think most people can agree that KF is probably better. Her 2 hit combo ender, unblockable S2, S1 that borrows the same passive as RKF elevates her above her Regime counterpart."
InjusticeMobile,3am7ad,IronTitan12345,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:33:29 2015 UTC,"Forgot about 2 hit combo ender, i also kinda thought in a way having less power leads to less specials which also reduces potential enemy healing. Need the KF flair update ?"
InjusticeMobile,3am7ad,jplank123,4,Sun Jun 21 16:42:50 2015 UTC,That  unblockable s2 makes  KF one of the best character in the game. That with tgear that gives her faster power generation can allow her to solo most mp or regular matches.
InjusticeMobile,3am7ad,byBumi,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:35:28 2015 UTC,"Yup, I can get two bars of power filled before my opponent can get even half a bar in."
InjusticeMobile,3am7ad,kikesaltos,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:27:59 2015 UTC,"KF is better for three reasons.  1) Her S2 is a finisher most of the time.  2) Her passive rocks since it doesn't let the other team charge as fast. People who gear their team to charge usuallybdpend on that to win. If taken away then it is bye bye.  2) Her passive prevents healing.....  Yes. By not letting the other team charge, their heal on S1 will not come that often either.   So, comparing RKF nad KF I believe KF is an all around better option."

InjusticeMobile,3amk92,handsolo85,4,Sun Jun 21 18:21:28 2015 UTC,"Please understand that your team is very strong but let me tell you the fastest and most op team i have experimented and trust me i have 3-4 charcters left to obtain i have tried them all, it's the traditional AO team with and extreme abuse of s2  Aob: demon blade, arrow's bow, batman's armour  Aods: ra's scim, ibistick, demon cloak  Aohq: revolver, sinestro's ring and bane's gear  It's simple: start with batman and go for winged avenger, in 4 out of 5 cases with the boost unblock chance and crit chance on s2 the opponent is down. Then switch to deathstroke. Ds is the best offensive player in the game imo. When you tag him in because of the ibistick and demonic cloak power regen, you should be one combo away from your s2 which will probably finish yiur second opponent.  For the third opponent keep deathstroke until you get s2 again, which is very easy even against pkf because you have 2 power regen gears and at the same time keep the oponent spelless because of deathstrokes great synergy with ra's( if you ask me ra's is more important gear for ds even more that promethium sword lmao). In most cases this should be the match it lasts a maximum of 30 seconds  There are 2 exceptions:    If you crit well first s2's on batman and ds's s2 you will finish even faster, about 20 seconds If you get shitty opponents such as both kf and raven or something, it should probably take 1 minute to win(i know right?)   Harley is there only if the match is taking too long and you throw a bomb or to heal deathstroke as he is not supposed to die at all.  Another advantage is that this team does not drag shitty opponents, i mostly get ao teams, shazams supermans and scorpions, rarely ravens or killer frosts  Try this and you will see true power"
InjusticeMobile,3amk92,CiobySpartanu,5,Sun Jun 21 20:30:12 2015 UTC,"Eh. Would be taken apart defensively. There is no symmtery to the team that would mean each character remains strong with the others deaths. It's pretty easy to combat single characters, regardless of how strong they.  Great from an attacking perspective sure. But the best team? Nah"
InjusticeMobile,3amk92,kopkiwi,3,Sun Jun 21 20:38:11 2015 UTC,"Solid team. There are lots of great combos, but I prefer teams who amplify each other through passives and/or play off each other's passives well. As you said, utilizing gear properly is also huge.  My current favorites are...  Killer Frost + CC Batgirl + 600 Wonder Woman,  AO Joker + AO Batman + Animated Harley Quinn"

InjusticeMobile,3amk92,xxxamazexxx,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:34:02 2015 UTC,"IMO == In my opinion  Why is everyone downvoting this person's opinion? I don't agree that it is the best team, but it is always good to see what others are playing with so you could try it or think of ways to counter it. That's kinda one of the points of this sub. Sure, there might be a ""best"" team, but maybe OP finds this one better suited to their play style.  In any case, have fun playing with this team OP. I'm still leveling my AOBats and want to keep him the same level as my AODS, so I haven't tried anything like this yet. But, I'm running my Killer Frost with the Ibistick, Ra's, and Mutated bone spikes as an S1 spammer (burn+heal)/power drainer/all around pain for most opponents."
InjusticeMobile,3amk92,CoalhouseWalker,0,Mon Jun 22 15:50:47 2015 UTC,"Obviously having the right gear is essential. But here's why I use this team  Scorpion is the strongest character in the game and his basic attacks have DOT. His S2 has a awesome DOT bleeding even if your opponent blocks. Paired with Rs he starts off with one bar of power and putting him in first gives you the chance to take power away from characters that start with 2 full bars.   AoB, because he starts off with 2 bars it's faster to get to full power. This comes in handy when fighting raven. Instead of using s2 I build up to use s3 and along with the batmobile gear he can then take out the opponent he's fighting while causing damage to the other team. Even if you don't knock out your opponent with s3 he's immune to any attacks for a few seconds. In my experience a new opponent tags in and uses a special move when batman cannot be attack.   KF, her passive comes to help a lot wether you're fighting or defending. She reduces power generation of the opposing team by 50% giving you the upper hand in using specials. Finally her s2 is unblock-able and has a high damage."

InjusticeMobile,3ak05u,Tyler0314,6,Sun Jun 21 01:35:09 2015 UTC,Honestly looks like the server glitch where 1 battle gets recorded as multiples. No way to know for sure since you have to be within seconds/minutes of the attack to be relatively sure.

InjusticeMobile,3ajkx3,rawbaw,3,Mon Jun 22 02:43:50 2015 UTC,"The best S2 is probably MKX Scorps. On its own they are powerful multihits, MKX can inflict CRIT bleeding (its good) if he hits 200% on this move. Combined with the attack, it basically ends most enemies. Because it's multihits, you can remove a weak enemy and drag a full HP one out in time to bleed him. He even gets a lifedrain chance with his gear.  The best S1 is DS (unblockable CRIT at 200%). Hands down.  If we're looking at BASE attack, no gear, I like statics S1 a lot. Solid multihits (can knock out enemy and fires fast enough to hit next one too) and it stuns. Totally boss move.  The best S2 after that is probably Zatanas. Hardy damage and 50% healing once you get the timing down. If you're fast you can even block the backfire (joker)."
InjusticeMobile,3ajkx3,LacidOnex,2,Sat Jun 20 21:20:21 2015 UTC,"Totally disagree on MKX scorpion S2 - whilst I agree the crit bleeding can be devastating, the enemy will often tag out so they don't get the full DOT and the multihits are pretty low damage"
InjusticeMobile,3ajkx3,hsttxns1,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:55:50 2015 UTC,That's a matter of timing. With his gear (dps enforced) you can wait for a swap or get the kill before he dives and land it on another char who has to wait out the swpa timer
InjusticeMobile,3ajkx3,NotTricks,2,Sun Jun 21 00:25:12 2015 UTC,"I enjoy playing with Arrow, so I'm partial to his S2 with his Customized Military Bow and the Ibistick. The damage he can do, both to the enemy and the bench with splash damage, is pretty good."
InjusticeMobile,3ajkx3,Aurora_Panagathos,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:32:59 2015 UTC,"I'd say KF for S1, lead KF with Ra's you can just start the chain right off the bat of just heavy combo into S1 again etc. She is hands down the most broken character in the game and easily sweeps teams. You could also use it as a set up for another teammate to switch in safely. And then we have S2 which is kinda hard, there are so many good ones like AOB, AODS,AniH/AH,Raven, Ares and the list goes on. But overall my favorite S2 is AniH/AH because its just so versatile. The heal is insane especially when you have upgraded gear. the bomb does good damage in niche situations and the damage buff is actually really good too. I've seen some posts on this sub with teams focused around leading with AniH and using the buff to just sweep through teams.  TL/DR: KF for S1, AniH for S2  EDIT: stated reasoning for my S1 choice"

InjusticeMobile,3aj6a0,ImJustATeen,7,Sat Jun 20 18:34:03 2015 UTC,"But ""Heal Self on Special 2"" effects don't stack -- having more than one is of little benefit. Granted, the increased Health from the additional gears stacks, and so the one heal effect you do get is bigger because it's healing a percentage of a higher Health, but that's going to be minimal.  It's a fun idea as a way to make use of cards that aren't normally considered go-to characters, but I'd change up Cyborg's gears slightly just for a little added advantage. For instance, just swapping one of the three for the Venom Injection System would give you the same health boost, so there'd be no difference on Sp2 heal, but would also give the option for the same heal on Sp1 just in case it was ever necessary. Or swap two of them for the Khandaq Royal Garb and the Carbonfiber Mask. That which give you a double chance to crit-hit on his Sp1; you might only use it ever rarely, if it all, but you may as well give yourself that option and chance since you'd still have the Sp2 heal with no difference anyway.  Personally, I'd probably sacrifice the Health boost on one of his slots and give him the Demonic Cloak instead instead -- power gen to get to that Sp2 faster, and then crit-chance on Sp2 which will usually kick in on at least one hit of the multi-hit Touchdown.  Again, it's a decent team that's a good break from the norm, I just think it could be optimized a little more."
InjusticeMobile,3aj6a0,lahatiel,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:16:05 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/lahatiel. It's a good team, by the lack of diversity in Cyborg's gearing doesn't give it it's full potential. If you were to change it up to something like Venom Injection System, Cybernetic Exoskeleton and either Nanocarbon Mask, Khandaq Royal Garb or even Silicon Carbide Batsuit would give you the same effect as your current lineup plus some powerful effects on your S1, should you choose to use it. Even Cyborg's sig gear gives him an effect on S1, so you would be healing an impressive amount of health with a crit and power drain chance, making it much more effective than your original team. Another good option is to put some basic attack boosts like Powered Escrima Sticks to just give Cyborg a little more oomph. If not you can also add Demonic Cloak for some crit chance on Touch Down,Ettinger you use it more often and making it more powerful. Other than that it's a good team with a good idea, just not at its full potential."

InjusticeMobile,3ahjhc,Devlyn16,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:36:07 2015 UTC,"It isn't exactly 'level' what they mean is the figure MP uses to match teams against each other.    Foe example: highest card  [on your team  team] damage plus  highest card [on your team] health   results in a numerical figure. The server then searches for a team with that figure multiplied by 1.xx [dependant on what stage you are in a battle 2/3, 5/5, 6/7 etc] and selects a team from a plus /minus range based on the result. If there are only a small poool of teams that fall in that range then you will face the same player multiple times."
InjusticeMobile,3ahjhc,Devlyn16,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:33:27 2015 UTC,I see. That's a fairly complex and interesting algorithm. Thanks

InjusticeMobile,3ag6hu,CaptainNeatoman,2,Fri Jun 19 22:21:37 2015 UTC,"Nice pull! I think you and I might have stolen the luck from the other people replying -- I decided to open some gear lockers today for the first time in a couple months, and ended up buying 16 because I was on such a roll: out of 16 packs/48 gears, I ended up with only 15 one-star, 20 two-star, 12 three-star, and a RAG Dagger.  I've always gotten 8-10 packs at a time, any time I've bought them in the passed, and apart form one eight-pack burst that only netted a single three-star piece, I've always had good luck, getting right around the expected averages or just slightly higher -- but I'd never had a run this good before today."
InjusticeMobile,3ag6hu,lahatiel,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:12:09 2015 UTC,"How in the hell are you getting enough money to buy 10 packs at a time. I been back playing a week after playing it originally for a few months (before online battles and gear upgrades even existed). Now i been top 5% last week and am so far top 3% now but only with bronze and silver teams, I dont have a gold team strong enough to compete as mine always loose, however im not even making enough gold to upgrade my gold players at 200k a time. How do i make 6.5 million to buy 10 packe at a time?"
InjusticeMobile,3ag6hu,garthy1982,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:12:01 2015 UTC,"6.5 million would be enough for 100 gear lockers -- to get 10 lockers at a time only takes 650,000. And 650K is pretty damned easy (for me). On my 20-minute train rides to/from work every day, I beat BB6 three times each ride.  BB6 three times per ride is 60K per ride, twice a day is 120K per day, so that means I'm making 600K per work-week even if I never touch the game apart from when I'm on the train (but I do play outside the train rides on occasion, usually when taking the train other places but also some MP at home occasionally to make sure I rank for a prize).  As to how I get that much, I've been playing the game for nearly two full years now, so the only cards I don't yet have at EVII are the ones I just never felt like bothering with. Consequently, I have so many cards that can solo BB6 that I literally run out of play time before my cards are out of energy. In your position, all you can do is grind, grind, grind. I know it really sucks, but it's part of the game, just a plateau that everyone will reach and need to get passed. I know I had to; so will you."

InjusticeMobile,3aew31,capitantelescopio,5,Fri Jun 19 15:57:43 2015 UTC,"Mostly Hacker, I mean, if there is an EVII CCBG he/she must have ended top 3 at least 3 times. Thats a lot of battle points."
InjusticeMobile,3aew31,Devlyn16,0,Fri Jun 19 16:14:16 2015 UTC,Not true. The CCBG card season has been run enough times that anyone who finished top 1%in all of them would have enough cards to max elite AND sell back a few. On top of this the top 3 get their rewards in ADDITION to the top 1% rewards. This may have changed when they upped the MP rewards a few weeks ago but was in effect prior to that.    That said it would be extremely unlikely to get her to EVII with a low battle rating
InjusticeMobile,3aew31,CaptainNeatoman,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:23:55 2015 UTC,Probably just someone who plays offline a lot.  I've had this game forever and I hardly ever played online until recently.

Didn't have a tough time winning against him/her, but I was a little curious as to how this person has managed to hold the top spot with mainly defensive wins. As of yesterday, he had 17/18 offensive wins and ~370/10000 defensive wins. He/she gets attacked every few seconds it seems, because every time I backed out and checked the screen again, a few more defensive battles popped up.  I saw a post about this player earlier today but didn't have a chance to comment. A few users seem to wonder if hacking is involved, but I honestly don't know how one could hack to generate massive amounts of defensive battles. Still is pretty suspect tho, if anyone can shed some light on this it would be greatly appreciated, because I'm stumped."

InjusticeMobile,3aevew,OhhKnows,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:42:28 2015 UTC,"First team:   Crit gear on KJJ is amazing, especially with Harley Quinn. So gear like Blade of the War God and Powered Escrima Sticks are great, and some healing on S1 like Mutated Bone Spikes and Knife Collection work well too.  For Shazam, pick something you like about his passive. If you like the bonus +300% damage on basic attacks, you can basically go the same build as KJJ because his swipes can deal up to 17k damage. If you want to spam his S2, then Ibistick (Can be replaced with Demon Blade), Demonic Cloak, and KryptBattle Suit are really fun to massively buff that spammable S2, and Ibistick's DoT hurts like hell. For Harley, go with her sig gear and power gen. It doesn't really matter what power gen, just put some So you can spam S2.   Second Team:   Since this team doesn't have much for a tank, AOBM gets The hob. Good gear for him is Charged Disk, Venom Injection System and Lexcorp Mechsuit for a fun stun chance on S2. Again, for a this Joker character, the setup stays the same as the other Joker, except replace one crit gear with Ibistick, and it will do wonders. For AODS, a good setup is Ra's, Prometheum Longsword and Mutated Bone Spikes/Knife Collection.   I know you said to leave Ibistick it of it; but I couldn't resist. Plus,when you get it you'll know who to put it on."

InjusticeMobile,3aevew,astrospeedyj,0,Sat Jun 20 13:11:55 2015 UTC,"What Ibistick does I'd increase both your S1 and S2 damage by 30%, add +20% power gen and whenever you use a special the enemy is lit on fire and takes 1% of their max health every second for 10 seconds. It applies to every special you use and will be applied multiple times when you use multiple specials really fast, doing insane amounts of damage. It's also affects the next person if your special knocks out an opponent so the DOT is never wasted.  TLDR: Yes. The DOT is applied to every special no matter what."

InjusticeMobile,3ae1wb,Dahvidmh,8,Fri Jun 19 10:43:46 2015 UTC,"He's fast and incredibly efficient with all-around great combat mechanics. His 5-hit tap combo and 4-hit swipe combo mean greater basic damage and faster power generation. His S1 is an effective power drainer (around 1.5 bars), which is super useful in this game, and his S2 is like a 10-hit that can inflict multiple enemies and deal great damage. He can just go on and on with his basic attack and power drainer, or tag in to dish out a dangerous S2.  His signature gear boosts his basic attack's damage, crit, and unblockable chance, which you can see goes very well with his design. If you give him Ra's scimitar too, his tap combo's 2-hit ender drains half a bar of energy (on top of giving him an initial one bar that he can bank in case of emergency.)  And did I say he's fast? He can get right back up after delivering a combo or a special. Gold Nightwing is always a pleasure to use. In fact I prefer playing with him much more the 'OP' characters like Raven or Shazam. I think that's also why he's got so much love. Just pure great gameplay instead of overpowered nonsense."
InjusticeMobile,3ae1wb,xxxamazexxx,6,Fri Jun 19 12:44:46 2015 UTC,"He can get right back up after delivering a combo     He has a bad pause after his light/hard combos. Hard especially. He used to be able to use an s1 at the end of it instead of just standing there, but the new change prevents that.  The pause is so bad on his swipe, that even if he connects, and hits the enemy, they recover faster than he can.  It's better to use his tap attack (delay isn't as bad), or use his swipe before tagging out. His tap attack is fast fast fast - even if he is  blocked, he can react faster than some characters and get in his hits before the defender hits him.  His 2 hit ender is excellent for ras. His 5 hit attack means more power, which means more special attack damage, and just more damage overall."
InjusticeMobile,3ae1wb,beomagi,2,Fri Jun 19 13:56:45 2015 UTC,"Great summary of NW, but I'll have to correct you with regards to that 10-hit S2. Unfortunately, it's not that amazing (if only it was), it's only a 6-hitter.  Doing combos with the S2 mainly relies on you finishing off an opponent with the first 3 hits, then smacking the next one to tag in with 2 or 1 hit(s), depending on the circumstance."

InjusticeMobile,3ae1wb,HumanChicken,2,Fri Jun 19 13:37:17 2015 UTC,i agree. Regime NW's passive is so much more useful than new 52 NW's. And i think his sp2 just looks cooler.

InjusticeMobile,3ae1wb,GoodLittleMine,1 point,Fri Jun 19 11:32:17 2015 UTC,"He's strong because of his attack mechanic. It's not flawless - there's pauses but you can work with it.  His swipe hits 4 times and tap 5 times. That's power and damage. More power = more specials. More specials = more healing!  So now you have someone that hits more often, drains opponents of power AND heals often. Obviously gear considerations come into play. It's common to see him with bone spikes/knife collection, his bo staff and ra's.  Use the swipe before you tag out. His tap attack is one of the fastest in the game. You can start your attack after some opponents and hit them first.  Being one of few power drainers, he can keep teams from using their specials. I generally use him with Lucy Bane tagging between the two. They with fudge you up. FUDGE YOU UP!!"
InjusticeMobile,3ae1wb,beomagi,-2,Fri Jun 19 14:04:52 2015 UTC,"Personally, i don't like him, I have use him with the right gear and he is ok. He is just..... Weird, he had like a weird pause in between his tap and swipe attack."

Commissioner Gordon:  GCPD gear: Commissioner Gordon takes 45% less damage from all attacks while blocking. Sp1: Single tap, just damage. Sp2: Rapid tap, then Rapid swipe. Chance to stun . Sp3: Five years in the GCPD have honed the commissioner, which he uses to beat his opponent up with.           Ra's al Ghul: Lazarus Pit: Ra's has a 30% chance to come back at full health upon knockout. Sp1: Rapid Swipe, power drain. Sp2: Rapid tap in center. Bleed damage over 10 seconds.

InjusticeMobile,3acz3r,UESPA_Sputnik,5,Fri Jun 19 10:48:31 2015 UTC,"Have a seperate team for defense. I sometimes see something like a kjj shazam combo, which works well for attack i suppose, ai kills kjj, Shazam. However, anyone in their right mind wouldn't ko kjj before shazam is down if they can help it when attacking you. Plus, on defense, shazam is more likely to use sp2 than sp3 as an ai, but that is just from personal experience."
InjusticeMobile,3acz3r,Vipper99,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:00:20 2015 UTC,"He uses s3 more when you block as he tags in. Time your block, and he'll normally use s2. I don't even worry about killing kjj first."

InjusticeMobile,3acz3r,jedispyder,4,Fri Jun 19 03:00:52 2015 UTC,doesn't matter I never kill KJJ first for the record
InjusticeMobile,3acz3r,Aurora_Panagathos,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:39:22 2015 UTC,"Good for you but not everybody follows that. Some people are too impatient and just want to get the match over with as soon as possible. Whenever I go up against a KJJ first, I just sit there and block and it increases the match time by at least a minute while I wait for him to tag out. Some people don't want to wait that long."
InjusticeMobile,3acz3r,jedispyder,2,Fri Jun 19 12:59:18 2015 UTC,"That's why your KJJ should be just as leveled and capable as the others. The life difference between KJJ and say Shazam or MKX is high enough that you're likely to want to kill him first anyway - but maxed out to the nines, OMG his swipe sucks to be on the receiving end. He'll whittle half your life before leaving, even as you're blocking.  One tactic for him with my tag team, is to stun with bane's tag in, and keep tag stunning until he leaves."

Response to last tip: sometimes individual's strength go further than synergy. I very much enjoy smashing Red Son and sometimes AI just does not know about synergy.  As for a good defense team, I would not recommend it, since it is really annoying for anyone to face. In fact, I think it is good to set your defense loose and do the attacking person a favor. After all u gain less than what he got to lose."

InjusticeMobile,3adzk6,adamd22,1 point,Fri Jun 19 10:07:32 2015 UTC,"Still waiting to see the actual, official release of the Tag Team Pack on Android here (also on a Nexus 7) -- have never had it appear regardless of whether or not my tablet was net-connected. But currently having only an E1 Lucha Bane and no copies of N52NW or HG, I've saved enough credits since the pack was foreshadowed during the 2.4 update release that I'll just be buying 8 of TT packs as soon as I see it.  As for the challenge resetting, I followed the suggestions I saw here and the WB forums of disconnecting Injustice from Google Play and then, before launching always clearing the app's cache and force-stopping it from Settings -> Apps, while only ever launching when I was connected to wifi. I've had no resets since I started that routine, even as I do switch between starting on my home wifi and my work wifi, and can play on the train between home & work with no connection, so long as I'd launched it while connected before leaving home or the office.   I know that solution sequence hasn't necessarily worked for everyone, but it's worked perfectly for me so far."
InjusticeMobile,3adzk6,lahatiel,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:42:33 2015 UTC,"And if I am playing on the train or elsewhere that I'm not connected, what I'll do is: launch the game right before I leave home while still connected, walk to the train, and play on the ride. I then quit the app fully (game's ""Back"" button to the main screen, then the OS' ""back"" arrow, and saying yes to the ""Are you sure you want to quit the game?"" pop-up) right before I'm exiting the train. Once I get to the office and have made sure the tablet's connected again, I go to Settings -> Apps -> Injustice, clear the app's cache (not data, just the cache) and hit Force Stop (again saying yes to the ""Are you sure?"" warning), and then I relaunch the game. It's come back up with my challenge progress in place, every time."

So when that comes up, I'll sometimes run through battles that I can simply blind-swipe (like B32, or Normal & Expert on challenges). I save tougher fights to which I actually want and/or need to pay .attention (MP, Nightmare, BB6 or 7) for my lunch break.  Hope the tips work for you (and of course, assuming you've already disconnected from Google Play, you'll have to hit ""Cancel"" on the two pop-ups that will appear during the boot sequence that try to reconnect you). I know they having worked for everyone, but perhaps us both using a Nexus 7 will work to your advantage."

The daily packs are really good for what you get because even if you get AniHQ or BA, the two cheapest cards in the game, it's still half the price of the character in the store, saving you a minimum of approximately 75k gold. It also increases your roster quite quickly, allowing you to grins for longer periods of time. I also have a hard time saving up money when I could be spending it on a potentially amazing character, so I eventually cave and buy a gold pack. That's my logic, but the truth is, just do whatever works for you."
InjusticeMobile,3acsvd,kopkiwi,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:48:58 2015 UTC,I think it's fine to invest in for the few weeks while you build a good gold bass that allows you do farm B32 and do a lot the challenges. But after that it's pointless.

Sure it's an easy promotion, but for the characters I want to promote, it is obsolete for me. When red son comes back on the store, that will probably be all I invest it for a bit."

I pride myself in almost never directly Buying or promoting card. There's not much fun (for me) buying packs where I know exactly what I'm going to get. I can get 10 Golds, 10 upgrades and 10 support cards for the price of 1 (3 characters) Arkham pack. I'd rather diversify."

I think it's interesting to see what character I'll get next even if it does take a while to promote all of them.   If you're a hardcore player who is in it to have the ""best"" team out there then yeah saving to get Arkham or RS packs are the way to go. For the vast majority of players though I think they get their 75k credits and just get a pack because 400k would probably take them a week or two."

When you are surrounded by JSGL's shield is another way (although probably if you are protected by the shield you have less health than Raven as in the first scenario). If Batman is under the protection given by the Militarized Batmobile, he  won't get his health switched. When you are in a dead-zone battle her passive (or anyone's passive) won't work.  IN any other case, you'll have to deal with her."

Towards the end of the s2 Harley is still immune to knock outs but not damage. It is possible for Raven to initiate her special during this time, which also makes her immune to knock outs but not damage, meaning the bomb can only bring her to 1 HP and in turn bring Harley to 1 HP instead."

InjusticeMobile,3aauo3,CaptainNeatoman,2,Thu Jun 18 16:34:53 2015 UTC,"I think you play to much defense. Almost no attack power except from Shazam.  The issue is that Shazam can be easily countered just by blocking. Even if you manage to get rid of one opponent then you are left in the blue.  Don't get me wrong. I believe Shazam is the most lethal, but since MP is team based, the whole team has to work as a whole, instead of the whole team working for Shazam.  If your Shazam is destroyed then JSGL may not be enough to handle a well built team.  You assume that everything will go according to plan and most times it's not the case. One you face n Ares, AODS or AOBM on a good team, they can get rid quickly of enemies and you will ve facing a not ready shazam."
InjusticeMobile,3aauo3,kikesaltos,4,Thu Jun 18 17:59:21 2015 UTC,I agree.  None of your characters have any gear to increase basic attack damage either.
InjusticeMobile,3aauo3,beomagi,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:17:26 2015 UTC,"What you guys are saying makes sense in theory, but in practice I've had dozens of battles with this team and not been defeated.  Blocking against Shazam's s2 doesn't really save the opponent, since another one is coming right away.  I think I've only had Shazam get knocked out once or twice, and JSGL was easily able to handle cleanup for him.  EDIT:  Shazam has Ra's Scimitar, which is +50% basic damage.  Not the 70% you get from certain other gears, but it's been enough."
InjusticeMobile,3aauo3,beomagi,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:32:37 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't expect you to be defeated - I'm just saying it's not really optimal. if you're a capable player you can play with the dream team of Bane, Batman Beyond and Boss Grundy and still win a battle."
InjusticeMobile,3aauo3,Imralion,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:57:14 2015 UTC,"Well that's true.  It's kind of a novelty team, focused entirely on delivering the nuclear bomb that is Shazam, but that's what makes it fun.  Building up for a bit and then relentlessly pummeling the enemy.  It's really good at what it's designed to do."
InjusticeMobile,3aauo3,beomagi,2,Thu Jun 18 19:05:20 2015 UTC,"Nice work, and nice team!  Have you considered switching JSGL for KJJ ?  It could be an excellent refill for a second bomb !! if he's not killed right away by any Ares or AOB... but still, super right away"
InjusticeMobile,3aauo3,beomagi,2,Thu Jun 18 19:43:14 2015 UTC,"Okay, I tried the team with KJJ instead of JSGL and it didn't work out as well as I'd hoped.  Without JSGL, Harley became an easy target and once she was gone, the whole thing fell apart.  But it did give me an idea for an alternate team.  I also worked in the suggestions from u/beomagi and u/kikesaltos by making Shazam a little more well-rounded and heavily boosting KJJ's basic damage.  I just played a five match battle with it and liked it even more than my original build.  So here's the new team:   Batgirl with her Nanocarbon Mask, Charged Disc, and the Amazonian Sword and Shield.  This makes her the tank, and her passive boosts Shazam's starting power from one bar to two. Shazam still has his Lightning Cloak and Ra's Scimitar, but he's swapped the Demonic Cloak for the Kryptonian Battle Armor.  This slows down power gen a little, which we've compensated for with Batgirl's passive, and the benefit is, when Shazam finally does go nuclear, he heals himself every time he uses his s2, which should be 3-4 times in a row.  You also have the option of releasing an s2 for some healing without doing the super, but I never needed to. Killing Joke Joker with his Comically Long Pistol, Blade of the War God, and Knife Collection.  Joker's basic damage is now heavily boosted, and he can heal himself a bit on S1.  If Shazam's super and the succeeding s2's don't finish off the enemy team, switch to KJJ and he should be able to finish the job.  On the off chance the opponent puts him down (which happened to me twice because my KJJ is pretty low level), then the other two get boosted to full bars.  You can immediately let loose with Batgirl's super and, if by some miracle the enemy is STILL standing (yeah, right), swap to Shazam and fire his super/S2 combination a second time.  Even if someone's still kicking after that, which I deem next to impossible, you now have a decently equipped Batgirl and Shazam ready for cleanup.   Thanks for the suggestions, guys!  The new team is deadlier than ever!"
InjusticeMobile,3aauo3,Imralion,3,Fri Jun 19 00:29:47 2015 UTC,"Sounds great. Don't do like so many and consider kjj's damage as secondary. Get into the block-4 swipes rhythm with some melee gear. Consider the venom suit or bone spikes as well so that you can keep recovering health with your spamable S1. KJJ is an absolute beast with his swipe attack. I've run thorough entire teams without ever tagging in another card. His loss for his passive is secondary.  You can still consider Harley - her bonus is doubled for Mister J. I think I use the upgraded battle staff (can't remember the name) on him. It's a 2 star gear that evolves to 3. It's I think one of two gears that provide both damage and defence -50% instead of a 70% max (not like I can afford to max most 3 star). Batgirl will definitely be easier in short fights, but you may like Harley more (especially with upgraded gear) in longer fights (power regen, team heal).  What is you method for raven with the current setup?"
InjusticeMobile,3aauo3,beomagi,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:30:41 2015 UTC,"Raven's a PITA.  At the moment, my only strategy is to take her down to a little below half using basic attacks, then try to land a super on her.  If done right, the super will knock her out and her passive won't have time to kick in.  It's not perfect, but if it doesn't work and she does steal health, I just swap characters and come back when I can heal."
InjusticeMobile,3aauo3,Feezbull,0,Fri Jun 19 01:46:20 2015 UTC,"If you're taking on Raven without the one hit damager, let her team damage one of your characters as you damage her. You're sacrificing one character really. Swap to a higher health character if she has a special ready and would likely kill your sacrifice.  Otherwise, when she's 25-30% hp (and so is your sacrifice) tag in the sacrifice (assuming joker?) go to town on killing her alternating attack and block to trigger her swap. if you're low health, it's a wasted swap, and her new swap point will be VERY low. Easy enough to kill with JSGL's S1 or even Joker's S1. Works best with some blocking gear to ensure that she can't kill you even at low health.  Often times I use the this technique and a multiple hit S2 to get her out of the way - enough damage to trigger the swap twice, without me having much health to take. With insurgency joker, I swipe away both health swaps, and if she kills me, just breathing on her kills her.  Get used to using your special between the hits of basic attacks. e.g. Superman's heavy attack is 3 slow hits, use your special between any of these. Static's heavy attack is 2 moderately spaced attacks and a long pause till the 3rd attack. Any special is unblock able if timed like this."
InjusticeMobile,3aauo3,Feezbull,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:43:37 2015 UTC,"I still use aniHQ instead of batgirl, and she's the one with Ra's. But i put Ibistick on Shazam, his white cloak and another power gen gear, which means, added to aniHQ powergen boost, that he gets his firts 3 bars pretty quickly.  I start with aniHQ, draining and popping damageboost asap, then KJJ for some damage and lowering his life, but prevent him from dying by tagging in Shazam, wich at this point is near 3 bars, just a few punches/kicks and it goes off for the Super/SP2 fiesta.  When it's finished, i either tag in aniHQ for a global heal, if needed, or let KJJ die (not without dealing some damage in the process), and it goes off again for Shazam!!  Plus if you boost KJJ SP1 with gear, he can take Raven out easily.  I've never lost with this team."

Waiting for a 3 bar super isn't always optimal. Batman's S2 isn't bad, and you don't have much to assist his melee damage, so you're not really doing much to get the point where you can use your super.  I'm assuming FK is for pressure - i.e. S1 spam given that her necklace and Kryptonite?"
InjusticeMobile,3ab68m,beomagi,3,Thu Jun 18 19:04:44 2015 UTC,"Bats super applies damage to the enemies entire team with the batmobile gear usually knocking out the first guy. Then i jump in and use KF special 2. Necklace give lifedrain on SP2 and kryptonite give chance for disable enemy special on SP2, and ibstick increased damage and DOT on SP2 so its a really effective combo. Plus KF SP 2 is unblockable. I usually win ultimate MP battles quite easily with this combo."

InjusticeMobile,3ab68m,beomagi,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:05:56 2015 UTC,Damage is more reliable too. SP3 damage is random from 50-100% of the damage. One SP2 comes close and can even surpass the maximum with critical damage gear.

That gives the highest xp before level 45.  I wouldn't spend to much credits on that gear, I would wait until you get a 3 star gear. People recommend doing the 75k everyday if you can get that many credits, and the gear locker once a week. you can sell extra gold characters before you promote them if you need some credits.  You want to have a few very strong characters when the challenges comes around, they give out credits, energy sets, and random cards throughout.

Elite my highest character can cost me almost all my credit, given that he's at IV. Buy packs, buy lockers, pushing my luck. Or just keep buying discount packs everyday. Or wait for those special packs to appear. Right now, just Gotham and Metropolis are in the store. Funny thing is, I thought if I could do well online, I could slaughter the offline battles.

InjusticeMobile,3aaq3k,Dark_Knight7096,3,Thu Jun 18 17:24:02 2015 UTC,"Well without knowing your highest cards it's difficult to advise you.  I'd recommend 75K daily packs every single day, try to get a handful of EVII characters and then level them up as much as you can, at the same time, buy gear lockers.  For MP, gear will make or break you. Earn as much as you can every day, but the 75K pack every day, then every saturday or sunday, buy as many gear lockers as you can with the leftover credits you have, shatter all your doubles and just wait, eventually you'll have a lot of shards and a lot of 3 star gear.  Then fuse the gears that you think will suit your playing style most.  I'd recommend trying to evolve heal on S1 gear and damage gear.  That will give you a good leg up in MP.  Also, depending on who your strongest cards are try to evolve their signature gear if you like the effect and they suit your play style, if not, don't worry about them.  I also wouldn't buy the gotham city or metropolis pack.  Both are pretty crappy IMHO.  If you want to get away from the daily packs, save up everything you can and wait for the Arkham, Red Son, or Femme Fatale packs to come back, they were way better."
InjusticeMobile,3aaq3k,beomagi,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:28:44 2015 UTC,"I restarted a few months ago after a corrupt save. I elited a few cards and used them to grind for red-son packs.  If I were to elite a 3 cards today for a cheap generic team, I'd go with Luthor + Doomsday + Ani_HQ and put most into getting doomsday up there. Luthor and HQ keep him alive by draining the enemy or power or team heals. Doomsday is generally self sufficient, gaining half his life with a kill - and generally killing with his S2. I had a higher doomsday initially since he did most of the work. Luthor drains the same way regardless of evolution and HQ's passive and heal was the same.  I did that to grind daily golds. After a few E4s, I pushed another team to E7 - insurgency Joker, Black Adam, Regime Superman. This is more of a damned if you do team. Joker is on Melee/S1 spam, Black Adam absorbs damage while returning it, and then uses S1 spam to heal and steal life, and superman's S2 is a great finisher, ignoring block - and is best used when his passive is active. Recently I've been using this during grinding MP and the new changes to Black Adam make him truly brilliant.  Don't start buying gear YET. Play MP for a few weeks and get some random gear, then invest in a few packs. Start prioritizing on gear to increase basic damage, then on healing gear/life gear.

Maybe they just like those characters and have gotten a lot of gear through other MP battles or gear packs?  Maybe they don't play MP that much cause their gear isn't that great?  Then again they could be hackers, but I'd expect hackers to have a good team with awesome gear."

InjusticeMobile,3aabck,CoalhouseWalker,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:03:09 2015 UTC,"Bonus Missions sometimes dictate who I play with. Or sometimes I am trying to get that last little bit of level for a character that I wouldn't normally play with, so I throw in a 49.9 guy with a couple 50s and leave it overnight once he levels and I quit. Sometimes, I pick out some characters that don't really go well together because I wanted to see if something in particular works as a combo: for example, Harley's Heal Plus Cyborg's tagged out healing powers, or Joker's Poison DOT plus the Ibstick's DOT, or maybe two fire DOTs, etc. Sometimes, I play with my ""A-Team"" and still need another 40K points to move up in the rankings, so I throw in my B-Team. Then I still need 15K, so I throw in whatever other Random 50e7s I have left over with energy. Sometimes I play with a non-synergy team just because I like those characters, or just saw them all together on something, and think it is fun (Like, I watched Arrow and then played with Arrow, Deathstroke, and Grundy, for example).   I try to not assume anyone is cheating unless they are doing something super-obvious, like playing with unreleased characters... And even then, I wonder if there are developers/beta testers in the wild."

I have a few that I completely elited before using at all. Usually, I'll get them to about lvl 20 before taking them into MP, but sometimes I'll start after lvl 5 so I can use gear (especially if the card is a challenge character I really want to try out, like my AO Joker).  I normally play with high level characters so I can get rank in MP, but sometimes I get really bored and want the challenge of using a weaker team for a few rounds.   Oh yeah, and if it is not a special MP season, there's a good chance I won't play for the majority of the season, just a few matches here and there when I feel like it.    TL;DR - I'm a lazy player. But yeah, it could also be hackers, I guess."

For those who have done this before, how often and how much do you have to play in order to make it?  In the past I've sometimes scored top 10% just by completing all the daily challenges, but I've never really aimed for anything higher than that."
InjusticeMobile,3a7acm,CaptainNeatoman,7,Wed Jun 17 20:50:49 2015 UTC,"Depends on your team. If you have EVII lvl 50 teams, you can probably get by with 3 or 4 Epic Battles (or whatever the 5-battle one is called) a day. Then again I skip days sometimes, so maybe more like 2 a day plus the dailies. All depends in how much everyone else is playing though. Each battle gives 4500-5000 each, plus the ending bonus. 7-fight battles give way better bonus though.   If you use lower golds or silver/bronze, you'll end up playing a lot more."

So, it's a little less than twice as tough to hit 5% in a Legendary Gear season.  *Remember, even ranking in the top 9.995% is treated like ranking in the top 5%.  ETA:  Stats are for iOS only"

InjusticeMobile,3a77ek,CoalhouseWalker,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:00:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I always thought: why don't I get nighttime bonuses whenever it is actually night, not just after midnight.   But even then, the time-based passive makes it to where I won't actually use them or make a team around them if I can only play it effectively at a certain time."
InjusticeMobile,3a77ek,AFulminata,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:08:38 2015 UTC,Gotta say i disagree.  I work for a living and get home around midnight.  The hours for this kind of team make it an optimal set. Do you really want nearly every player and their child making off like a bandit with a grand set?
InjusticeMobile,3a77ek,UriskLyErg,2,Fri Jun 19 01:35:48 2015 UTC,Aquaman could be buffed to 20% per team member due to strict time and build requirements and be like RSSG.  Superman isn't really a power character. So I'd give him bonus damage like rss.  Hawk girls critical should just be pure critical and grow based of black night chars.   I would give flash 10% speed for all chars scaling with blackest night characters.   Wonderwoman I would centralize around blocking. Maybe take 10% less damage per char or give reflection chance.  I'd also have Solomon grundy with an immunity to all DoT for all blackest night characters at all times.  In saying this they could have weaker passives that then double after midnight to balance the timing issue.

His passive is the perfect potential counter to Ares, thought in reality they would never be matched together.  On the other hand, Regime Grundy with Darkseid and blocking/health gear can be surprisingly beefy... though still not evough to stand toe to toe with Ares."

InjusticeMobile,3a491b,_____hates_me,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:35:40 2015 UTC,"Most of it. Depends on their basic attack pattern. The level up/elite modifier (x 29) and the support enhancements modifier (x 1.35) is the same for everyone. A tap attack does 2% damage, tap attack combo ender 3% (it is possible to have two hits, 3% each) and swipe 4% is constant, but there are many different combinations of how many light/heavy hits in the combo. For instance, the vast majority of characters have a 3 hit heavy combo, so it is 12% total for them, but for all Joker characters it is 4-hit for 16%.  Prime Killer Frost is a particularly odd case:  Light combo: 2% x 3 + 4% x 2 = 14%  Heavy combo: 4% x 2 + 2% x 2 = 12%  Her light combo ender is 4% instead of the normal 3%, and the last hit of her heavy combo is split into two half-hits."

InjusticeMobile,3a3vnr,Aurora_Panagathos,5,Wed Jun 17 00:52:55 2015 UTC,"Lawdy what. These passives are so retarded from the games mechanics I'm pretty sure only sinestros works. Flash passive is infinite lives. Green laterns is straight up bunk, where does the extra power go? Wonder woman's is what I don't even understand how you'd use her power instead of yours. Lex is manageable but not really in his flavour."
InjusticeMobile,3a3vnr,UriskLyErg,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:57:03 2015 UTC,"Flash can be killed when he has less than a bar of power.  Green Lantern means we can have more than 3 bars of power, which is great for everyone (Flash got more life, WW can generate forever when tagged out, Lex can have incredible buff, and  Sinestro can have the team generate more (say flash has 2 bars now and an opponent tag out, flash will gain 80%of a bar))  I also think Wonder woman is hard to code."
InjusticeMobile,3a3vnr,UriskLyErg,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:56:27 2015 UTC,Flash will never die on offense though. Power drain dosent take effect until after damage so he will always regen and you can start him with ras and power gear. His innate animation speed is more than enough to juggle opponents into oblivion. More than 3 bars of power is total bunk and I don't think you understand the coding implications of it both backend and front end gui. Sinestro should just be a static amount not based on what % you already have it's hard to code and will be useless 99% of the time

InjusticeMobile,3a024u,Vipper99,7,Tue Jun 16 04:15:11 2015 UTC,"I enjoy playing with him. With Ra's gear, he can power drain and has a good 1 bar, able to counter a lot of AOB or AODS w/ Ra's.   When combined with his bow gear, his S2 does solid splash damage. You can up the damage with an Ibistick or go for heal/block gear with the Blue Lantern Ring or Supeman's gear for more heal and health.   I dunno, he's fun for me."

InjusticeMobile,39ylc7,Mellakka,0,Mon Jun 15 22:34:21 2015 UTC,"It was like a year ago when I did quite a bunch of those console unlocks, so I did not expect to get anything ever. And I still have not gotten anything (Android) so this just got my hopes for nothing. Not that I really need any of those bonuses anymore, but it would have been nice."
InjusticeMobile,39yjja,Vipper99,6,Mon Jun 15 20:55:50 2015 UTC,"Unblockables are via either gear or special attack powers. For gear, they are always on the gear ability that goes to whom it belongs to. Like, Eskrima Sticks for Nightwing, when fully evolved and maxed out then put on Nightwing give him a 25% chance per hit to break the block. This is also on Martian Manhunter and Doomsdays gear, off the top of my head.  So it's not by technique, it's really by gear. For special attacks ( no gear required ) it will say it on the ability like Regime Superman's special 2. Others have unlockable or block breaks in the middle of their specials like Prime Killer Frost and Godfall Superman special 2s.  As for juggles that is stringing together attacks in a way that the enemy has little to no chance to block or counter without a special. A really easy character to do this with is Batman's heavy swipe. You hit all three, and it doesnt knock them down but it knocks back. When they are running up again you time the first hit to do the chain again, and proceed nigh infinity.  Many characters can juggle in my experience but some are much harder than others. If I was confusing in anything let me know and I'll be glad to clarify."
InjusticeMobile,39yjja,Z91www,3,Mon Jun 15 23:51:53 2015 UTC,"Very Concise, and well done.  Unless anyoone else has something to say about this im just gonna call   /thread"
InjusticeMobile,39yjja,AFulminata,3,Tue Jun 16 00:17:47 2015 UTC,"there were ""unblockable"" combo/special attacks but due to a bug with the current update they've all disappeared.

InjusticeMobile,39yjja,NateGT86,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:48:48 2015 UTC,"so there are no ""unblockable"" combos into specials currently..

InjusticeMobile,39zife,kikesaltos,3,Tue Jun 16 01:27:02 2015 UTC,"My top three probably consists of Ares, Raven Prime, and Shazam. I don't play much mp since I've taken more of a collective approach, but from what I have seen I like these."
InjusticeMobile,39zife,Vipper99,2,Tue Jun 16 01:41:02 2015 UTC,"Right, Raven would be my fourth choice for sure."
InjusticeMobile,39zife,VoidTorcher,3,Tue Jun 16 02:31:41 2015 UTC,Things are very different for offence and defence.
InjusticeMobile,39zife,VoidTorcher,0,Tue Jun 16 02:15:26 2015 UTC,"True. Mostly because of the stupid way the AI handles deffense. There should be an option to at least hint how the AI should fight when deffending. For example, a choice of preference of Special, so it doesn't unleashes S1 as soon as they are available. These are easily blocked and expected. I have been hit with S2 probably just about 3% of times and Supers one third of that. There are characters that benefit from S1, others from S2 and others from Supers. Why would anyone equip batman with the batmobile for deffense?  Now, I really don't care about deffense. I don't have the time to be switching teams and gears when I am done playing. It doesn't counts against you if you loose, sooooo."
InjusticeMobile,39zife,Abbhrsn,2,Tue Jun 16 02:30:27 2015 UTC,"To be honest I think supers is even less than a third of s2 for me, more like less than 1/10. S2 is relatively common for 600WW teams (with Prime Killer Frost shudder) as long as they get 2 bars while tagged out, made even worse by how well Ra's works on KF. They still use s2 rather than super the majority of the rare times they do get 3 bars."
InjusticeMobile,39zife,simulcat,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:51:57 2015 UTC,"I still have only been hit by Shazam's super in this game, never seen another opponent use one."
InjusticeMobile,39zife,Abbhrsn,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:06:34 2015 UTC,"Once I go hit by AOB's super; that was how I first found out about the Batmobile. And one time--this was really strange--I was fighting Darskseid, and even though I kept blocking, he wasn't using his S1 or his S2. He just kept attacking until he had three power bars, and then unleashed his super. I have no idea why the AI would be programmed to do that in one game out of a thousand, but there it is."

InjusticeMobile,39xstk,Dark_Knight7096,2,Mon Jun 15 17:56:04 2015 UTC,"As long as you originally completed his challenge, he should be unlocked in store, it doesn't matter if you get him from a pack later or not, as long as you did at one point beat the challenge, they should remain unlocked regardless of if you get another card from a challenge pack later or not.    To find out for sure, open the game and go to Luchadore Bane, see if you can promote him from the card, that'll tell you 100% for sure."

InjusticeMobile,39vqrl,lahatiel,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:34:00 2015 UTC,For some reason when KJJ is knocked out Harley usually tags in first. At any rate a useful heal (since the gear heal is scaled to Harley's health) is very rare in defence.  I never evolved my Dark Sword either and I'm trying to conserve what little shards I had left.  Edit: 60%? Projected figures from the 0.5% I get from evolving once means it tops out at 15%. I have freshly evolved Diamond Tipped Claws and it only gives 13% boost to s2.

InjusticeMobile,39q06d,kopkiwi,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:20:06 2015 UTC,It's just the bug that removed the ability to let loose a S1 right after using a heavy combo. It used to make all of WW's S1s unblockable.

InjusticeMobile,39qj79,zororod123,9,Sat Jun 13 19:51:17 2015 UTC,"His S2 has nothing to do with his sig gear, because it doesn't crit. His S1 works wonders with his gear. Combine that and Ibistick, a 200% hit will cause each instance of damage to deal over 15k damage without any damage buffs. The only problem with it is that it doesn't hit multiple people. The animation of his S2 is so long that it can K.O. all 3 opponents if timed correctly, making it extremely effective when cleaning up a battle. Spamming your S1 is much better vs one beefy opponent like a buffed Shazam or CDD (His S1 rips through CDD's passive like a katana through thin paper). They are both good and deal a lot of damage but have their different uses. Lots of people also have a hard time landing Point Blank's 200%, so they pick the more reliable Identity Crisis."
InjusticeMobile,39qj79,IronTitan12345,2,Sat Jun 13 20:09:43 2015 UTC,I love punking out CDD with AODS.

InjusticeMobile,39qj79,IronTitan12345,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:24:51 2015 UTC,"Due to his insanely high damage, good gear are Ra's Al Ghul's Scimitar, Prometheum Longsword, and Mutated Bone Spikes/Knife Collection. That's basically his standard loadout. His 2 hit combo ender is ideal for Ra's, and the free bar of power it gives is just beautiful. Healing on S1 is really good, and sig gear is absolutely necessary. Anyone who plays AODS and gives his sig gear to another teammate needs to uninstall immediately. When you obtain Ibistick it can replace Ra's."
InjusticeMobile,39qj79,caughtupincrossfire,5,Sat Jun 13 20:37:21 2015 UTC,"S1 can easily defeat 1 opponent, S2 can defeat 1 to 2 opponents, or defeat 1 and heavily damage next in line."
InjusticeMobile,39qj79,shadyone33,2,Sat Jun 13 20:02:36 2015 UTC,I usually use his S2. I have Ares and I use his S2 which will knock someone out then I tag in AODS and rip off his S2 while the other team can't block.
InjusticeMobile,39qj79,jedispyder,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:51:46 2015 UTC,"I use his S1 simply because it is unblockable most of the time. I'll use his S2 if I have Arkham Harley on the team when it can be potentially unblockable.  Yet as /u/IronTitan12345 stated, his gear does absolutely nothing for his S2. Are you thinking of another character's gear?"
InjusticeMobile,39qj79,simulcat,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:29:27 2015 UTC,"I use his S2 only if he has already built up two bars of power while tagged out or if I'm dealing with a high health character who keeps blocking basic attacks, and manages to regenerate energy and heal too quickly."
InjusticeMobile,39qj79,myster5,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:19:01 2015 UTC,i find the s1 more fun because it takes skill to hit the 200% but which aoDS special i spam really depends on team composition and battle strategy. the gearing is also different depending on what aoDS's role in the team is.
InjusticeMobile,39qj79,2007rnc,1 point,Mon Jun 15 07:18:15 2015 UTC,"Everybody should be using his S2 because it's almost guaranteed unblockable with AHQ. Stack that with power gen gear and his tap attack and you'll launch maybe 4 of his S2 in a match. And 1 of them is more than enough to kill Shazam at full health. His S1 is too unreliable, his S2 is incredibly consistent and nukes everything in you're path. So please, S2 him, the high tier teams use it for a reason."
InjusticeMobile,39reok,markom1997,3,Sun Jun 14 00:45:45 2015 UTC,"If it ever makes it into the Gear Locker, it won't be for a long, long time most likely.

InjusticeMobile,39q6t0,kroateon,3,Sat Jun 13 18:03:00 2015 UTC,"After Static, there was a Zatanna repeat, then Prime Killer Frost began. Zatanna's passive is that, when performing her special two, she either gains a huge buff or inflicts a huge debuff on her enemy (or she stuns herself). Prime Killer Frost's passive is that the enemy team generates 50% less power. Arkham Origins Joker began after Prime Killer Frost, and his passive is that his specials inflict poison DOT, and the damage done by the poison is multiplied with each Arkham teammate (i.e. with only himself it does damage times 1, with himself and another Arkham it does damage times 2, with himself and two other Arkhams it does damage times 3. It is multiplicative, not additive). Additionally, there was a multiplayer season for the legendary gear ""Mysterious Artifact"" which evolves into the Ibistick."

InjusticeMobile,39omfw,Masterdikkster,2,Sat Jun 13 07:20:06 2015 UTC,I'm not realy sure if teaming up these characters would work against stronger characters. Any insights will be really helpful!
InjusticeMobile,39omfw,beomagi,5,Sat Jun 13 08:55:24 2015 UTC,"You should at the very least be able to see if the passives benefit the team they're in. Also you should see if anyone in the team is more offensive or defensive and balance the team.  e.g. Hawkgirl - keeps people from swapping out AND lets her side swap faster - so you benefit putting her with bleeders and putting her with the usual tag-in passive characters - Lucy Bane, Nightwing, CC Batgirl etc.  You have those that benefit anyone - e.g. Luthor gives a huge 30% life bonus - but think further. He's best with those that really need it (glass canons like Ares), or those that benefit having more life from their passive  - Doomsday, Raven, Boss Grundy, John Stewart etc.  How about offensive+defensive characters? While I see you can manage with Luthor+Ani HQ+Boss Grundy, neither of them has a really damaging melee attack or S1. Swap her with prison superman at the least - Joker gets a massive buff from her. Superman - even prison superman - is fairly offensive, having a fast tap attack for draining energy, and his S2 has a high enough damage first hit to kill off Raven if needed. His heal is based on his max life - so he benefits from luthor greatly.  None of these match ups should be set in stone. Be inventive, but look for pros and cons of the characters themselves. Putting a supposedly weak character that has a good easy juggle can make a team much more viable than simply looking at stats."

InjusticeMobile,39ondw,adamd22,2,Sat Jun 13 11:51:46 2015 UTC,"An alternative to the usual is Lex Luthor - his 30% boost makes it harder to hit her last 20% in one hit, making it easier for her to take out someone with her passive. Another powerful character - is the new Killer Frost. Having the opposing team gain half their energy, means they're less likely to hit with a heavy damaging attack that can kill raven.  Both KFs + Raven is a combo I fear."

Know your priorities You already have a pretty decent defensive team with the last 3 EVII's listed.  It's not a god tier defensive team but will attract matches Invest upgrades in healing gear too, especially after you evolve some of those gears in bold.  Don't upgrade the evolved gear until you have a diverse set of evolved gear (dmg, healing, power, block)"

I'm currently using Killer Frost, RS Superman and RS WW as my multiplayer team and I believe it works okay - I have no problem staying in top 1%. I never found healing gear very impactful either in defense or offense so I never really considered leveling it, but I might give it a try. I already just take my gear to the evolved stage and move on to the next one. Thank you for your reply!"
InjusticeMobile,39n7si,r0xxon,3,Fri Jun 12 23:57:40 2015 UTC,"The girl squad is fairly OP, and so OP people dodge it in ladder matches.  Healing on S1 gear comes in handy especially for defense.  It's match winning if you're down to the last 1v1 especially with Ra's and is great for stalling while your team powers up."
InjusticeMobile,39n7si,2007rnc,2,Sat Jun 13 01:26:48 2015 UTC,"She's damn near impossible to get but you need AHQ on the arkham team. She's mandatory, unblockable S2 is too powerful. I'd remove either AOB or AOJ. Ok enjoying AOJ a lot right now personally."
InjusticeMobile,39n7si,2007rnc,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:51:32 2015 UTC,For some reason I thought that AHQ only gave health so I never considered adding her...  Now that I think about it AO Joker arguably does most of his damage with his poison so you can just spam S1 to apply it and AO Deathstroke also does the most with his S1 cause of the crit so the only character she would genuinely be helping the most is AO Batman so I'm still not sure if I should be aiming for her...
InjusticeMobile,39n7si,2007rnc,3,Sat Jun 13 10:18:29 2015 UTC,"No no, don't focus on AO Deathstroke's S1 focus on his S2, give him all power gen gear and spam his S2. His tap attack with maxed out power gen gear fills the entire first power bar in one go, the the second bar just as fast. His second special is a 8 hit move with a chance to stun, for me, with no boosts to it's power, I hit for about 70k which is more than a crit S1 does anyway and with AHQ's ability, each hit has a chance for unblockable, so if the first hit isn't unblockable, the second hit also has a 50% chance to be. Then put all health and heal gear on Harley, specifically he pistols because they heal your team for 25% plus they heal them again for another 25% if you pick the rose. It gives your team unmatched longevity. AO Joker is up to you, I prefer abuse of his S2 because it also hits 9 times and it has a bug where if it kills a guy, the next one to enter in is poisoned from the attack even if he's never actually touched by it. That's just my two sense, I almost never lose, the only trouble I encounter is regular KF. And even then AODS's massive power gen counteracts it. So take my advice how you will."
InjusticeMobile,39n7si,myster5,1 point,Sat Jun 13 11:19:02 2015 UTC,Thank you for the information. I will consider it. I guess it depends on how fast I'll be able to get Arkham Harley Quinn.

I don't have much in the way of gear, but I run lex's gear on him and raven's in her, and ibstick on KF. Ideally I would probably stick killer frost's gear on her plus more energy gen, heal gear and hp on lex and raven."
InjusticeMobile,39k5dw,myster5,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:23:44 2015 UTC,i used to run this team.  i stopped because they weren't getting attacked enough...  but it was an impressive win rate and gave the attacking team long fights.
InjusticeMobile,39k5dw,r0xxon,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:04:01 2015 UTC,"This season is slow because AO Joker is in and school is out.  Generic MP gear rewards aren't going to be a draw right now People are wising up and dodging teams including Raven with other Femme Fatale, KF and Ares.  Especially in the first couple of ladder matches, it's just easier to restart than potentially waste the time and energy."
InjusticeMobile,39k5dw,Devlyn16,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:52:15 2015 UTC,"Or it could just be your Defense team doesn't match up as well as the offense team you left in.  The reality is that if 500 players have teams that match well against a red sun team and there are 50 red sun teams left out for D then those teams will see Defensive battles. Where if there are 500 bleed D teams out there but only 100 offensive teams playing that match well against them,  significantly less matches for the Bleed D teams."

InjusticeMobile,39k5dw,andriodleftbehind,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:39:40 2015 UTC,"I'm a little confused. Are you assuming that people are rage-quitting just because you're not getting as many attacks? I find I get completely different numbers of attacks depending on which team I put up, and the same team can vary a lot seasons to season (83 attacks in one season, 27 the next). I doubt that's all because of rage-quits."

InjusticeMobile,39o8fp,Feezbull,2,Sat Jun 13 14:59:27 2015 UTC,I tried looking for a link but can't find it as well. Hmm?

InjusticeMobile,39i108,assissan,3,Thu Jun 11 21:40:42 2015 UTC,"This is very nice and everything, but I would be happy with a game that worked without wiping out my progress."
InjusticeMobile,39i108,geekasaurus_rex,2,Fri Jun 12 18:30:49 2015 UTC,I just realized this must be because Arkham Knight is coming out.
InjusticeMobile,39i108,iny0urend0,6,Fri Jun 12 02:29:14 2015 UTC,It also says that on the announcement.
InjusticeMobile,39i108,Xicoro,3,Fri Jun 12 03:14:11 2015 UTC,Wow. Long day I guess.
InjusticeMobile,39i108,iny0urend0,2,Fri Jun 12 04:53:25 2015 UTC,"No worries, it happens. :)"
InjusticeMobile,39i108,Xicoro,2,Fri Jun 12 06:18:32 2015 UTC,It says so at the top...
InjusticeMobile,39i108,Diablos_Advocate_,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:15:26 2015 UTC,"Welp, time for new Arkham Knoght has tees to come out and make AO teams obsolete.  Seriously though I like the looks of Arkham Knight Batman."
InjusticeMobile,39i108,adamd22,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:11:27 2015 UTC,"I've heard that Bane's passive is going to be really awful. When below 50% HP he will grant 1 bar of power to his teammates... That is not a very good passive, IIRC."
InjusticeMobile,39i108,GoodLittleMine,9,Thu Jun 11 21:24:39 2015 UTC,"Man I think it's a pretty great passive honestly, much better than AOJ's. If you find yourself about to get wailed on you can send in bane to absorb it and benefit from it.  I mean if you're in a tight spot that extra bar means your ArHQ can come in and revenge dynamite or heal him back up"
InjusticeMobile,39i108,Greidam,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:38:01 2015 UTC,"Does it grant the bar of power to any teammate, or only other AO characters?"
InjusticeMobile,39i108,Voidhound,3,Fri Jun 12 01:19:55 2015 UTC,Just Arkham characters. But giving AOJ/AOB/AODS/ArHQ a free bar of power is pretty big
InjusticeMobile,39i108,Greidam,2,Fri Jun 12 01:27:52 2015 UTC,Especially AODS
InjusticeMobile,39i108,Sabermawile,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:37:32 2015 UTC,"2 bars would be better, does it only work with arkham team mates?"
InjusticeMobile,39i108,DEADP00L_,2,Fri Jun 12 00:07:35 2015 UTC,Yup only to Arkham team mates which makes it really poor
InjusticeMobile,39i108,ConorHickey0,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:39:51 2015 UTC,"It would actually be an awesome passive, but I think it is strictly for Arkham characters. Makes it kinda ""meh""."
InjusticeMobile,39i108,batfleck91,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:50:01 2015 UTC,"What's interesting to me is the fact that they will apparently go straight from KF to Joker to Bane, which will take us into mid-July. I think there was only one new character left after that. Could we have another update by the end of summer?"
InjusticeMobile,39i108,kasper11,9,Fri Jun 12 00:51:41 2015 UTC,Two left: Regime Hawkgirl and Bounty Hunter Lobo.

InjusticeMobile,39iqd6,CaptainNeatoman,5,Fri Jun 12 00:14:46 2015 UTC,Batman beyond is available in gold pack he is rare though..scorpion available in the MW the Mk not mkx .. Regime Shazam doesn't  released and we don't know if it well... Knightfall bane you could get with console unlockers and available in the silver pack pretty rare as well .... Any other characters there is no way  to get for now
InjusticeMobile,39iqd6,assissan,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:26:10 2015 UTC,Ow and Ares and ccbg in the mp season for sure
InjusticeMobile,39iqd6,assissan,5,Fri Jun 12 00:26:55 2015 UTC,"Batman Beyond: Very rare drop from Gold packs Animated BB: Challenge character. Unobtainable at the moment if you missed the Challenge. May get added to Challenge pack at a later date. GF Supes. Same as ABB. Challenge character. Not in packs yet. Ares: MP reward Static. Same as ABB and GFS. Both Scorpions: Challenge Pack. Believe one is in the Most Wanted pack but not sure which. RSGL: Same as ABB, GFS and Static. CCBG: MP reward Shazam. Rare drop from Gold packs. Also in Most Wanted packs. Knightfall Bane: Console unlock, rare drop from Silver packs."
InjusticeMobile,39iqd6,wood33430,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:43:16 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the detailed info.  For clarification, I was asking about Regime Shazam.  Only Vanilla Shazam is in the MW pack as far as I can tell.  I want the fella with the black cape.  Others on here have said he's not released, but I could swear I've fought him online."
InjusticeMobile,39iqd6,wood33430,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:27:34 2015 UTC,"Very welcome. And yeah, I'm 99% sure there is no Regime Shazam out yet on Mobile. Would be nice, though."
InjusticeMobile,39iqd6,r0xxon,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:31:58 2015 UTC,"Nice summary. Can anyone confirm Scorpion MKX in the Challenge pack?  I've gotten MK in both as cited, but never MKX and have opened lots of CP"
InjusticeMobile,39iqd6,ravennoir,-2,Fri Jun 12 21:02:10 2015 UTC,"I got my ABB from a Gold pack, not that I use him :)"
InjusticeMobile,39iqd6,astrospeedyj,5,Fri Jun 12 00:56:04 2015 UTC,"I think you mean regular Batman Beyond, because ABB is not in any packs. He'd never be added to the gold packs, either, considering he's a challenge character."
InjusticeMobile,39iqd6,shadyone33,2,Fri Jun 12 01:07:33 2015 UTC,It might be an idea for a sticky to have who is in what pack so that everyone doesn't have to ask.
InjusticeMobile,39iqd6,Devlyn16,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:17:53 2015 UTC,"With the recent change to the femme fatale packs and the wide range of arkham and RS characters I wonder if the the Devs are moving towards rotating characters in and out of the packs when they rotate the packs in and out of the store.  Between the Gotham, metropolis and jla packs they could easily give us limited access to some of the lower RNG drop characters"
InjusticeMobile,39iqd6,ravennoir,-5,Fri Jun 12 11:45:11 2015 UTC,"Batman Beyond (regular and animated) - I got Animated from a Gold Pack, not sure about regular, dont have him yet Godfall Superman - Im guessing from a gold pack, but I havent got him yet Ares - MP only Static - I only have him from the challenge  Red Son Green Lantern - hes in the challenge pack Cassandra Cain Batgirl - MP Only Scorpion - hes in the challenge pack Mortal Kombat X Scorpion - I only have him from the challenge  Regime Shazam - If there is only teh one Shazam (I dont have the game in front of me), hes in the Most wanted pack Knightfall Bane - in the Silver pack, but the drop rate is low"
InjusticeMobile,39iqd6,Xicoro,5,Fri Jun 12 00:22:40 2015 UTC,Could you please not spread false information? Think before you post... Nearly half of your information is incorrect.
InjusticeMobile,39iqd6,ConorHickey0,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:11:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks! There are two Shazams.  Only the prime version is in the MW packs in my experience, but there seems to be some question as to whether Regime Shazam is even released on mobile."
InjusticeMobile,39g8d1,gondi,3,Thu Jun 11 14:49:25 2015 UTC,"B36 is best for experience, IIRC, unless of course you can solo BB6 past the mirror match with 2 characters along for the ride. I also like B36 for credits/time. It's not very energy-efficient, but you can blast through those easy two-character rounds really fast with low-elited golds."
InjusticeMobile,39g8d1,Stewthulhu,2,Thu Jun 11 15:27:05 2015 UTC,"Depending on your roster, for good exp. gains past lvl 45, BB7 is the best in SP if you're up to the challenge. Otherwise MP is the way to go."
InjusticeMobile,39g8d1,Smellyjuji,2,Thu Jun 11 15:32:49 2015 UTC,"at lvl 45, with the right gears, it's not that challenging. you can always take 2 of your maxed out guys and one lvl 45 to stomp through it with ease."
InjusticeMobile,39g8d1,myster5,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:53:54 2015 UTC,"Both good points, gear matters as much as your team in BB7. I remember when I took my best team at the time which was RS DS, WW, and Supes, but with no gear or alliance support cards. I got owned on the first fight."
InjusticeMobile,39g8d1,Smellyjuji,2,Fri Jun 12 02:16:56 2015 UTC,"yup same thing happened to me...  decent lvl40-ish ev team, (edit:) no alliance, no gear... got obliterated! edit 2: now it's like ho-hum, need to grind my last bronze to lvl50, ho-hum"
