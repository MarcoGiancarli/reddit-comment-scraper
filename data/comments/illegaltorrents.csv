illegaltorrents,3e3204,BurnsVapes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:04:17 2015 UTC,"Season 1 has not been released on home video at all yet.  The reason season 2 has a dub is because it was part of the 2015 Winter season, which was the season Funimation started their simuldubs (releasing dubbed episodes 6 weeks after the subbed version).  However, they have confirmed that it will have a dub when they do release it on BD/DVD.  You might encounter the same problem with Akatsuki no Yona (Yona of the Dawn), which was a 2014 Fall 2-cour show, however because Funimation wanted to include it with the simuldubs, they simuldubbed the 2nd cour only, meaning you will have to wait for the home video release to see the 1st cour dubbed."
illegaltorrents,3e5691,ghou112233,3,Wed Jul 22 01:14:11 2015 UTC,Why?
illegaltorrents,3e5691,testname246,2,Wed Jul 22 05:14:21 2015 UTC,Subject lines like this should be banned.   !!!!! Clickbait !!!!!!   Looking for obscure/unpopular song. Does anyone have or know of a source?   No. YouTube it maybe - Mp3 at best. No luck with popular torrent sites? It's not popular then. What do songs even cost? $0.99-$1.99? I refuse to deal with itunes and did not click on the link.

illegaltorrents,3dytiq,aranord,2,Mon Jul 20 17:16:14 2015 UTC,Currently no. Not that I've seen anyway. The guys at cs.rin found something with the Trial version to play indefinitely but that's about it.  Denuvo stepped up it's game after 2.5 and 3dm/scene haven't quite caught up. I have no idea if anyone is even working on it right now. None of the current versions have this Mouselook fix.  We probably won't see a updated version until a GOTY edition comes out. Assuming one does.

Has for ""Nemos"" I can't recall any other work they've done but the description looks pretty much identical to the R.G. teams stuff. So I can assume they are related. Can't know for certain tho.

illegaltorrents,3djx71,FaineV,2,Thu Jul 16 21:55:35 2015 UTC,Maybe. It depends... Is providing a url for a torrent download actually illegal?
illegaltorrents,3djx71,PianoMastR64,3,Thu Jul 16 22:28:07 2015 UTC,It's debatably illegal under the dmca. Links to copyrighted material have been required to be removed by judges. Not sure it's in the letter of the law.
illegaltorrents,3djx71,not_all_trolls,2,Fri Jul 17 01:49:49 2015 UTC,"But a link here to a magnetic torrent file is a link to a link to a file so in the law there is no way it could ever be illegal. If the copyright content is illegal to download then the website hosting the file is responsible, users are just linking to a file which is being shared  is not a crime in itself as nobody can declare a file is illegal other than the content holder using a dmca request for take-down.I cannot contact any website and just state that a file is illegal as i am not the copyright holder and it is explicit in the dmca that only the copyright holder or his legally licensed. representative can take down content explicitly.  Only a copyright holder can verify a copyright violation, that is the way they that have the power of copyright monopoly have wanted the system and ensured that is the way it works.  The only person that can identify a piece of content as not allowed to be on any specific website is the copyright holder.  For example If you go to spotify or apple music or amazon prime you do not have any evidence that content is legally being shared with you, you accept that the content is licensed and legal just as most using torrent technology believe that content shared is legal due to the copyright industry not taking it down with the tools they have and they have some very powerful tools just look at the powers they have on youtube that they brag about taking down over a trillion links, surely if they are taking down so many links there should be not much content available so anything i see must be legal... and even if it is not it is up to the copyright monopoly to take it down not me not a moderator nor an admin, that is why there is a dmca law, it protects all involved from legal action as long as they abide by the dmca.  And that is why this subreddit should be legal and should be allowed, it actually gives the copyright holders access to links that provide content they can check for being illegal or not."

Sure some of the requests are likely just a lazy person who won't bother searching themselves, but many others come in here because they may not know HOW to search for what they are looking for.   I come to this sub a few times a day to try and help people find what they otherwise couldn't. I'll even go so far has to provide a bit of support if they have any issues with a link I provided. Sometime ago a user came to me privately about an issue with DLCs not working from a torrent I posted here for a Mass Effect trilogy. I spent the good part of a day working out what the causes may have been with them and in the end we fixed it. Aside from them being incredibly grateful, it provided more insight on refining my searches to a more technical aspect.  People requesting things aren't the only ones who can benefit here. Users like me who answer these request and go on the hunt will generally get better and better at it. Finding new resources, techniques and tricks which will make it easier for us to find the thing we personally want, while at the same time potentially answering more requests here.  We aren't hosting anything that can't already be found. I feel its more like giving them a map with an X on it and sending them off to claim their booty.  /endrant"
