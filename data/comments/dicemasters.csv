dicemasters,3e6qbd,calisk,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:30:05 2015 UTC,"nope damage is until end of turn.  for example let's say i deal 1 damage to giant man on his 7/7 face, then roll him down to his level 1 face which is a 1/1 he would be ko'd. it doesn't matter when i roll him down as long as it is during that turn."

As far as BAC's, consider either Blessing, or if you have it, Teamwork.  I have hit opponents for 20+ damage in one turn SO many times with that.  Remember, Monster is an affiliation...  :-)  I would also consider putting in some form of Red Dragon, for the global and cheap Blessing/Teamwork."

dicemasters,3e60n8,meltedleon,3,Wed Jul 22 05:46:34 2015 UTC,"having played mtg helps, but several rules are different particularly the fact that this game has no stack.  on my turn I can activate 3 abilities, play 4 champs, kill two of your guys with action dice and you likely won't get a chance to do anything in response to me doing all this till after it's all said and done. There are exception like redirection abilities and damage prevention abilities, but most stuff you can't.  from what i've found this is the biggest hurdle for magic players to get over."
dicemasters,3e60n8,calisk,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:09:53 2015 UTC,I agree playing magic helps a lot. It is a mix of Deck Building and Magic. Combat from MTG and Purchase/Casting from DB's.

Tip: If you are a MtG player, the best thing you can do is to forget everything you know about the MtG rules, because this is a different game, with different rules, even in similar situations.  Lots of MtG players come to this game and don't understand this rule or that rule because it goes against what they know about MtG.  Free your mind!"

dicemasters,3e60n8,Deathcrow666,2,Wed Jul 22 07:51:22 2015 UTC,"Serious question: I haven't been playing for long but what I've noticed are major similarities between the two games such as the cost to buy/play a card is at the top and requires a specific type of energy/mana in order to buy the dice. Also, other than the fact that if a dice goes unblocked then it goes to the used pile instead of right back to the field, the combat system seems to be ripped directly from Mtg. So, what exactly is so different that it's abhorrent to you that people claim similarities?"
dicemasters,3e60n8,drakemacgavin,2,Wed Jul 22 13:41:38 2015 UTC,"There's less of a build up mana screw.  You start with all option on the board, imagine magic if you had the option to pick which card you added to your hand each turn instead of just drawing a card.  Your discard pile goes back into your deck/hand whatever you want to call that equivalent in magic.  Creatures have a 50/50 shot of being rolled as energy instead of a creature to attack defend.  The differences are immense!  There are similarities, combat is one of them but that doesn't mean people should clump them as the same game. The game is attack versus defense, it may seem likes its ripped off magic but that's because magic combat is pretty simple."
dicemasters,3e60n8,GreenLanternNova,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:46:16 2015 UTC,"With this game, you have a tad bit more control right from the start. Magic, to me is more rng and luck. And the mana pool can screw you for many turns if you get un lucky."
dicemasters,3e60n8,Deathcrow666,2,Wed Jul 22 14:10:41 2015 UTC,"To continue this thread, I can see the valid contrasts between the two games. It just seems like some people are taking this game way too seriously that they feel the need to distinguish it by making extreme comments about it. I do agree that, in mtg, getting mana flooded/starved is frustrating. But I have a hard time believing there is less randomness in a game based around and named after dice. Also, with the massive overuse of that elixir of immortality card in mtg, EVERY deck can get their graveyard back like it's no big deal. There's no finality to using a die or a card in either game (anymore)"

dicemasters,3e4sd3,kenkoden,2,Tue Jul 21 23:20:56 2015 UTC,The cards are unique in the starter and you don't need more than one copy of a card. There is always a 4th card for each character that's in the gravity feeds and that's where most people get the remaining 2 dice for the starter characters.

dicemasters,3e4sd3,GoGoNJDevil,2,Tue Jul 21 23:57:15 2015 UTC,Pretty much...unless you want doubles of the starter cards.
dicemasters,3e4sd3,zetaspawn,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:00:40 2015 UTC,Yes. My wife and I share dice and cards and we STILL don't get more than one starter. It's just super pointless.

dicemasters,3e4sd3,GreenLanternNova,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:26:55 2015 UTC,"My wife and I are the opposite. When we go to big tourneys sometimes we like to run the same character. Rather than having 1 AvX starter and hoping to collect 4 Beast dice from foil packs we got 2 starters and only needed 2 dice. This is mitigated now that starters are commons in the foil packs but there's still often a few awesome starter cards you might want on both teams. Beast, Storm, Kitty Pride, Batman all come to mind."

dicemasters,3e2ynq,zyg101,3,Tue Jul 21 15:40:09 2015 UTC,"All the sets are designed to play together. You can have any combination of cards on your team.  I would grab DnD for the Basic Action Cards (BACs) and AvX for the characters. Really I would recommend getting all of them at some point if you start getting into it.  You can play with 2 people and a starter, but it won't be the full game. It would be a watered down version. So it's good for getting started, but you'll find that you will want to buy some packs. Probably a lot of them. Cause this game is awesome and slightly addictive. In a good way.  If you starting buying packs get AvX if you can. You can still find them, but it's going to start getting pretty difficult. I haven't heard if Wizkids is going to reprint them again. AvX has some of the most powerful cards in the game.  Playmats aren't necessary, but I custom made one for myself and love it.  Avoid Collector's Boxes until you really want to get into the game. You get a couple packs and a variant card. It's really just for storage and you might find that you would rather store them differently than in that box. I did."

dicemasters,3e2ynq,javaplusjava,2,Tue Jul 21 16:08:40 2015 UTC,Each starter has enough in it for 2 players. So if you have 4 people buy 2 starters and 5 packs a piece and build a team.

dicemasters,3e2ynq,javaplusjava,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:43:30 2015 UTC,awesome stuff ! I went with D&D and will probably go on what you said if i like the game.  One more thing though. Is there a good place to start learning the game ? (Or i'll just look for a dice tower / rahdo video !)
dicemasters,3e2ynq,calisk,2,Tue Jul 21 21:42:54 2015 UTC,"all of them =D  To sum up play mats are great for organization but just like in magic where a play mat is nice, it's not required. If you are learning though these mats are great, they direct you in your turn order/operation, where to move dice, where to keep them, and even help to track life.  each and every starter box contains numerous new options for a new player, new basic actions and new cards to play with, and you can't get a single one of these cards from boosters, as such you don't need to worry about getting repeats later if you decide to expand your collection.  if 4 people are just starting out and you want to see if you even like the game, buy one avx starter, and one age of ultron starter, that will give everyone the ability to make around 1 deck each."
dicemasters,3e2ynq,jonyet,2,Tue Jul 21 17:17:28 2015 UTC,"it's also worth noting that when you pick up a starter, which has enough for 2 players, that gives you enough to play a truncated starter game (4 characters per person, 10 dice, 10hp).   this isn't a bad thing, as there is a bit of a learning curve thanks in large to the way the rules are written out. i would recommended each person get a starter that is close to their hearts, then maybe you all collaborate and get enough boosters from a single genre gravity for a rainbow draft (12 boosters each from AoU, for instance). everyone pays roughly 30 dollars and you all get enough cards/dice to play bigger games right off the bat, if you are so inclined.  oh, and the mat definitely helps. instead of spending 30 dollars on one of the tourney mats, i actually printed out some decent smaller mats (11x17) and had them laminated - no complaints about that so far!"

I enjoy most if not all of the cards from that set for origin flavour and playability.  sadly that's all they got right.  the art is poor, copy and pasted directly from the show in low res.  the dice are all numbered for no real reason other then to annoy players when playing competitively.  although having strong and enjoyable cards their is little in the way of new decks that came from this set.  the set is generally disregarded by the community so if you do like playing anything from the set like I do you tend to get frowns from the hardcore marvel dice master players.  the set balance started to really come into it's stride after yug, cards like BEWD, Jinzo, magnetic shield, and many more are all good, but you can really feel the newer sets oozing with flavour while this one just has some good cards that kind of resemble the original game.  top that off with short print runs making the individual cards harder to get( 40-50 dollars for a simple BEWD rare which i have 4 of ) and it's just a really hard set to get into."
dicemasters,3e3o97,duroyprofundo,3,Tue Jul 21 18:36:18 2015 UTC,"no player 2 does not get a chance to respond to anything till player 1 passes priority.  so yes he can activate a global then an action and even more before player 2 gets a chance to respond, but player 2 does get a chance to respond before he attacks.  likewise once player 2 has priority he can do as much as he likes before passing it back.  the damage on the side kick remains 5."
dicemasters,3e3o97,calisk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:52:01 2015 UTC,"Very interesting...I didn't understand this aspect of priority passing until now.  In this case, then, the defender had better hope that there's another character with less than 5 attack left to swap with.  Cool."
dicemasters,3e3o97,forte27,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:31:36 2015 UTC,"likewise once player 2 has priority he can do as much as he likes before passing it back.   I don't believe this is correct. From the AoU rulebook:   In tournament play, the active player takes as many sequential actions as desired (from zero to all possible actions) before pausing and indicating that the inactive player can take an action. The inactive player can then either perform an action or decline the opportunity. Then the active player can take more actions.   Emphasis mine. It indicates that the active player takes any number of actions, then the inactive player may take an action. Then this repeats ad infinitum until the active player passes priority after in the inactive player passes priority."

dicemasters,3e34au,Spiral0Architect,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:22:25 2015 UTC,I'm glad they're taking a breather (for whatever reason) between AoU and WoL.  I wasn't looking forward to two sets dropping within a month of each other.
dicemasters,3e34au,KoutetsuKaigun,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:32:16 2015 UTC,I'm liking that mat.  Are the character dice going to have the same stats as their counterparts in JL?
dicemasters,3e34au,calisk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:22:12 2015 UTC,"Possibly not.  I know for one that Iron Man changed stats, and energy type, between Uncanny X-Men and Age of Ultron."

dicemasters,3e34au,StormyWaters2021,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:49:44 2015 UTC,I know the batman die looks identical...but other characters have changed from set to set. So...i guess the answer is...i dont know.

dicemasters,3e34au,jonyet,2,Tue Jul 21 22:44:35 2015 UTC,The Ninja Turtle set will probably come out in Febtober then.

dicemasters,3e3a1u,calisk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:27:37 2015 UTC,I really like the uncommon Kobold for fist team ramp for sure. Also one of the starter Zatannas works well
dicemasters,3e3a1u,JakeSalvage,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:12:28 2015 UTC,"The best is by far the Kobolds. A form of ramp that encourages you to spend all of your energy that turn and not have to save some? Yes, please.   Aside from that, anything that causes you to prep die that you can activate fairly often can come close.   Churning is another route. Gambit and other similar cards can cause you to cycle through to get dice that matter which can be similar to ramping."

dicemasters,3e2q2y,calisk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:21:09 2015 UTC,"The best way to think about transit zone, and how I explain to people new to Dicemasters, is in terms of Dominion and other deck building card games.  In Dominion, you have a deck of cards that you're drawing from (that's your dice bag).  And you have your discard pile where you put the cards you've played (that's your ""used pile"").  HOWEVER,  When you play your turn, you play the cards to the table.  You do NOT play them directly to your discard pile. Only at the end of your turn do you gather up all the cards that you've used during the turn and place them in the discard pile. This is the exact concept of the transit zone. The transit zone is the cards on the table. They're not in your hand, they're not in your draw pile, they're not in your discard pile. They are on the table. The comparison isn't perfect but is it VERY close and I think pretty intuitive for people familiar with deckbuilders."

dicemasters,3e2ydk,KoutetsuKaigun,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:59:56 2015 UTC,"In a sense, yes.  Adventures vs. Monsters as opposed to Heroes vs. Villains."
dicemasters,3e2ydk,kenkoden,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:46:59 2015 UTC,"But I assume in tournaments there's no ""effects targeting 'villains' also target 'monsters' and vice versa"" rule?"
dicemasters,3e2ydk,KoutetsuKaigun,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:06:35 2015 UTC,"Correct.  Classifications never change.  That is why the best cards affect players, opponents, characters, and sidekicks instead of Villains, Adventurers, and Monsters.  General is always better than specific when playing Unlimited."
dicemasters,3e17ha,IvorySwings,2,Tue Jul 21 04:15:27 2015 UTC,the ruling was made in regards to taking possession and then polymorphing.  in these cases the dice returns to the owners used pile.   assuming the ruling stands( and I see no reason why it wouldn't ) the dice returns to the owners prep area.
dicemasters,3e17ha,calisk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:29:06 2015 UTC,I would assume as it is knocked out that it will go to their prep as the die is theirs. I'm not sure if there is an official ruling or not.

One of the great things about Dice Masters though is that there are so many good commons and uncommons too, so don't limit yourself by just building off of your rares.  Pick a card or two from your list above that you love and go from there. Your Psylocke is one of the best two-cost masks in the game, so if you're running a Prof X for the global she makes a perfect choice to get that engine going. So if you're going to generate a bunch of energy, what do you want to use it for? Direct damage to your opponent? Buying up huge characters? Paying for actions that you really like?   There are so many good builds in this game that are really different play styles, so start working towards a style that you like, that way you'll be interested to refine it and make adjustments after a few games."
dicemasters,3e06eu,calisk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:25:42 2015 UTC,"you got some amazing starter super rares  so rather then give you advice on how to build your deck I can help you understand why they are considered high end rares.  beast- AOU : so the only beast I like from this set is the rare, he is aggressive ramp, and played right he will really bump up your dice, ramp in this game is everything, the more dice your are rolling each turn the more options you have.   jacosta - her ability is both offensively and defensively amazing, but it's only as good as the ways you have to take advantage of it. for example I like to ultron drones with her, this results in me having the global in play to force the biggest thing on my opponents side of the field to block jacosta and they start to hurt themselves. on her own without globals she's likely to be easily dealt with.  jinzo : as i've said with jacosta global are everything in this game, they are your defence, they are your offence, they are your ramp, they are your removal. hurting your opponent every time they use one of them is just great, he is costly though and is only relevant if you get him out early.  constantine hell blazer : he is a security blanket, say your opponent is filling up on champs with strong fielding effects, do they have a champ with a nice ability? well constantine can make sure you at least get a round to not worry about them. he won't win any games on his own though.  hulk green goliath: he does win games on his own, he is traditionally the biggest strongest board cleaner in the game, and swings like a truck, typically very hard to get out and if you buy him early you will find yourself losing turns to just pay his fielding cost, especially if your deck doesn't have a lot of ramp.  prof-X : the meta's biggest ramp card, their are a lot of strategies to how to maximize his global ability and I suggest you look into them, even if you don't play this card you will play against it frequently and when you do you will need to play the game in the professor x style or be at a disadvantage.  psylocke : removal on a stick, personnall i'm not a fan there are better options in the game for removal now, but if you like her you can't get any removal that is more direct then her.  wolverine weapon 10 - he's tricky if you run him you will have trouble against things that stop units from attacking, attacking alone is a huge liability and you will need to find ways to get him by, on his own he is not that good, but with support he is amazing."

Too bad they changed it. Ties are stupid.   If there is a conflict of timing (e.g., both players want to use an ability simultaneously), the person whose turn it is always resolves their effects first. If simultaneous effects are controlled by the same player, that player chooses the order of those effects. This rule will avoid the situation where two people reach zero life simultaneously."

dicemasters,3dybpq,jhoratio,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:18:45 2015 UTC,"The way I understand it Jocasta's ability would've only triggered once, still KO'ing your opponent though. I don't think she triggers per dice because the card doesn't say when a Jocasta die is damaged.   But back to the original question, I think it would be a tie because Jocasta's damage is (maybe) still considered combat damage since it is redirecting. Hope this helps but that's a pretty crazy situation."
dicemasters,3dybpq,HBOPrime,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:58:29 2015 UTC,"I agree that damage takes place before effects of damage, but I'm not certain Jocasta's ability is an ""effect of damage"" per se.  Her ability is an ""instead of"" ability, not a redirect.  She does not take damage, then redirect to a different target.  The original damage intended for Jocasta goes directly to the opponent as if it was the original target. Timing is concurrent with all other combat damage."

dicemasters,3dybpq,StormyWaters2021,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:48:10 2015 UTC,"I think with weird corner cases like this the attacker has priority on his effects. Yes damage is simultaneous but I seem to remember in the rules that if two things try to happen at the same time (like multiple damage triggers) the player with priority (attacker) gets to choose the order of effect resolution.  I don't know if it goes as far as ""stacking"" combat damage in your favor, but generally the attacker does have the advantage in dice masters so I'm not sure..."
dicemasters,3dybpq,Arbiterchrono,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:07:30 2015 UTC,"Nope. From the rulebook:   As soon as your opponent’s life reaches zero, the game ends and you win! If both players would reach zero at the same time, the game ends in a tie."

dicemasters,3dybpq,StormyWaters2021,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:35:17 2015 UTC,I've been playing that Jocasta only can trigger once per turn no matter how many dice are out. Is this incorrect?
dicemasters,3dybpq,thegreenlanternguy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:15:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is incorrect. Each die should trigger once."
dicemasters,3dybpq,StormyWaters2021,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:46:50 2015 UTC,Awesome. I already was liking her on my team. Now I love her on my team.
dicemasters,3dybpq,thegreenlanternguy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:22:52 2015 UTC,"Attacker wins. This is in the rulebook.  Sidenote, please don't use ""KO"" in the context of players winning and losing. It's really confusing! Players don't get KOed, they lose!"
dicemasters,3dybpq,jhoratio,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:15:53 2015 UTC,"Attacker wins. This is in the rulebook.   Please check your rulebook.    As soon as your opponent’s life reaches zero, the game ends and you win! If both players would reach zero at the same time, the same ends in a tie.   That's from the AoU rules."
dicemasters,3dybpq,StormyWaters2021,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:04:58 2015 UTC,"yep in the case of this situation the attackers damage resolves first, page 8 of the avx rule book paragraph 1 states that damage is dealt simultaneous, in the rare case that it matters the attacker assigns first.  as such his damage would kill you then jocasta would deal hers but you'd already be dead."
dicemasters,3dybpq,calisk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:51:16 2015 UTC,"Not according to the AoU rulebook.   As soon as your opponent’s life reaches zero, the game ends and you win! If both players would reach zero at the same time, the game ends in a tie."
dicemasters,3dybpq,StormyWaters2021,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:06:39 2015 UTC,"the aou rule book has not changed the ruling on assigning attack damage, the rule you are stating would be relevant if say you deployed an electro zombie while both players are at 2 hp.  the rules for assigning attack damage still are in effect for this case and no tie would occur."
dicemasters,3dybpq,calisk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:22:19 2015 UTC,"It does change the rules about damage.   It says that the attacking player assigns damage first, but that they resolve simultaneously. So I decide where my damage goes, then you decide where your damage goes, then it all happens at the same time."
dicemasters,3dybpq,StormyWaters2021,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:31:58 2015 UTC,"I believe that Jocasta's ability could be considered a blocking ability in this case and would redirect before other damage is resolved, hence that attacker would lose. This is just how I would play it. I would resubmit the question to Dice Anon and Wizkids (diceanon will answer you first) to get a more official answer."
dicemasters,3dybpq,Bahamut7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:33:50 2015 UTC,"It's not a blocking ability. A blocking ability says ""When this blocks..."" Jocasta's ability just changes where the combat damage is applied. It will still apply as combat damage at the same time."
dicemasters,3dybpq,StormyWaters2021,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:54:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the above is merely my opinion. I was saying that it could be considered like a blocking ability and be different than the usual rules for combat damage but at the same time I have no idea on an official answer and that it should be submitted just in case."
dicemasters,3dybpq,Bahamut7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:00:21 2015 UTC,"I get what you were saying, and I'm saying it can't be considered a blocking ability. It applies outside of blocking in the first place, and in the second place has no trigger that would be considered blocking-related. It specifically says that it changes where damage is applied, which is well after blocking."
dicemasters,3dybpq,StormyWaters2021,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:04:27 2015 UTC,"A glaring problem I see with this is the card states the first time Jocasta is damaged per turn. Only one of those would be redirected. Additionally, it is not per die,  but based on the character.   Taking that into consideration,  I would say the attacker won this time."
dicemasters,3dybpq,DelayedSword,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:01:16 2015 UTC,"A glaring problem I see with this is the card states the first time Jocasta is damaged per turn. Only one of those would be redirected. Additionally, it is not per die, but based on the character.    I believe you are wrong, based on this ruling. ""The first time"" refers to ""the first time this die"". So each Jocasta should have a trigger."
dicemasters,3dybpq,StormyWaters2021,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:46:29 2015 UTC,It appears I stand corrected on that. Thanks for showing me the light!   This also means the card is more powerful than I gave it credit for. I can field four of those bad boys and have fun hurting me. Time to think about capturing dice or straight KO with no damage again.
dicemasters,3dybpq,DelayedSword,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:05:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it does get a lot better that way. I realized that my current team has no issues with Jocasta anyway, so it's a non-issue for me.   As to non-damage KO, I have recently fallen in love with Millennium Puzzle. It doesn't KO anything, so it doesn't trigger KO effects, and it moves them straight to the Used pile, so they can't just get re-fielded the following turn."
dicemasters,3dybpq,StormyWaters2021,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:40:26 2015 UTC,Thanks for all the input. I have submitted this question on the wizkids rules forum and hopefully I have full clarification from wizkids.
dicemasters,3dybpq,HBOPrime,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:50:13 2015 UTC,If and when this question is resolved on the forum will you post the ruling either here or on the main page? That would be awesome since there is so many different opinions.
dicemasters,3dybpq,mojopilz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:54:54 2015 UTC,I will definitely share what I find out. I am still waiting for my post to be approved on the wizkids rules forum.
dicemasters,3dybpq,StormyWaters2021,0,Wed Jul 22 13:30:50 2015 UTC,"The way you explain this situation and the way I understand it is that your opponent won. What I'm basing this on is that the combat damage is dealt simultaneously and the ability of Jocasta is triggered by that combat damage. So in essence, your life points were taken down to 0 before Jocasta was triggered."

dicemasters,3dzfyk,twinsofterror,2,Mon Jul 20 22:44:36 2015 UTC,I believe so. Thankfully this checklist was not as horrible as the completely incorrect Justice League one.
dicemasters,3dzfyk,calisk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:48:04 2015 UTC,"i used the check lists in the first set, but once I began organizing the sets i don't even look at them anymore.  I organize my binders by brand/e type/alphabetical/character/rarity/cost in that order  as such I cross sets quite often to get pages with nothing but hulk on it in my binder.  in the end I like the display and I never quite need a checklist, there is usually only 8-11 characters of each type which equates to 3-5 pages depending on how many have 4 characters and take up two rows, and it becomes very obvious if I'm missing a card."
dicemasters,3dzfyk,twinsofterror,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:06:44 2015 UTC,"I like this method. I currently have my binders split up by Brand, then the cards are in alphabetical order. Energy type/alphabetical looks like it would be useful."

dicemasters,3dwsx9,jhoratio,2,Mon Jul 20 20:43:07 2015 UTC,You still put them in the used pile when you buy them.  That is not when the ability triggers. It's after they're fielded and they go to the used pile that the ability would fire and the dice would go to prep instead.

dicemasters,3dwsx9,Chimbley_Sweep,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:26:50 2015 UTC,I've never heard of purchasing two dice simultaneously with basic energy. I know you can spin down say a double mask from a character dice to split it up but I thought the generic (2)'s had to be used all at once?

Rocket Racoons ability to not be KOed in combat is very nice. Giant Man turned out to be an early wrecking ball.   My favorite combo from the draft was Captain Marvel Common with Jocasta Uncommon. They are dice drawing machines together. With Nasty plot, you could get 4 dice into your prep area without any having to have any dice KOed. Only downside is that they both cost 5 and can be expensive to field."
dicemasters,3dudba,MortalSword_MTG,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:05:50 2015 UTC,I had a tasty build of Rare Rocket w/ 3 dice and U Giant Man with 3 dice. Felt really good to swing with a 7/7 and Rocket every turn. This format has some killer role players.
dicemasters,3dudba,dasgoomba,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:02:33 2015 UTC,"I honestly thought sitting on Red Skull (Common) to be pretty funny. When he gets knocked out, opponent chooses to take 2 burn dmg, or for me to heal.

dicemasters,3dvazn,mkremer90,2,Sun Jul 19 20:39:34 2015 UTC,It just means it requires two of the same energy. So you can pay it with 2 of any fist energy.
dicemasters,3dvazn,Spiral0Architect,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:40:21 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks. Just was confusing because in older sets it was two single energy icons next to each other, but in AoU it's the double energy icon."
dicemasters,3duax8,Jman4562,3,Sun Jul 19 15:26:17 2015 UTC,"If you look on the bottom of the card, you'll see symbols.  There is usually one energy symbol, followed by two sets of doubly that energy symbol, followed by 3 Character Faces.  These are the levels of the character in order.  The first and most likely weakest face is level 1, the second face is level 2 and the third face is level 3.  Certain cards have effects that spin levels up or down.  These are the faces you would be changing."
dicemasters,3duax8,GoGoNJDevil,2,Sun Jul 19 15:35:22 2015 UTC,Thank you but I was confused on how you change the level?
dicemasters,3duax8,Necromanticer,2,Sun Jul 19 15:40:18 2015 UTC,"There are certain effect such as the Polymorph global that allow you to spin characters up or down levels. Otherwise, the only way to change level is to have a character leave the field and be rolled to a different level face when you draw it next."
dicemasters,3duax8,GoGoNJDevil,2,Sun Jul 19 15:43:24 2015 UTC,"The level the die comes out on is the level it's fielded at. Thats why you want to roll higher levels. You just have to pay higher fielding costs. As far as changing levels on a die in the field, that has to do with card effects. If you look up polymorph and check out the global you'll see an example."
dicemasters,3duax8,GreenLanternNova,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:04:32 2015 UTC,Another example if you don't have D&D is to check out the uncommon Captain Marvel from AOU.

dicemasters,3dtkb0,srbandrews,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:56:56 2015 UTC,"Umber Hulk (Paragon Beast) is terrific in any team and definitely worth considering regardless of other choices. As DrJohn has said, Swarm is pretty much a must, although the Halfling Thief (Minion Harper) performs a moderately similar function.  I used to play a team that used the Halfling alongside Unicorn (Paragon Beast), The 4-cost Copper Dragon and Minsc & Boo. Used the weak Halflings to churn dice to buy the first few characters and then, once the Unicorn was in play, the buffs makes them actually useful in combat. It was pretty successful (against my friends, casually) but got a bit boring and predictable - also susceptible to Umber Hulk.  I've since switched to Kobold (Paragon Humanoid) for my 2-cost (worth considering Magic Helmet (Greater Gear) as well for a lead Kobold - or Orc, if you're using Orcs for Swarm - to pretty much keep him in the field indefinitely and keep that swarm going) and use my first few turns to purchase those and Polymorph with Red Dragon Global. This gives you plenty of energy and the chance to Polymorph your bigger creatures in as soon as you buy them - Green Dragon (Lesser Dragon) is an ok choice as you may be rolling a lot of Kobolds and occasionally you might find yourself with ONLY fist energy."
dicemasters,3dtkb0,DrJohnZoidbergPhD,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:16:41 2015 UTC,"We did a tournament like this a few weeks back. Swarm is absolutely necessary, it's what's going to win you the game. Red Dragon and Resurrection are other viable ramp, but not one sided. Equipment is pretty good, or it was at our shop. Half-Orcs and Elves to go with those equipment. Umber Hulk, Purple Dragon, Unicorn and Troll all preformed well. That's not mentioning anything else that is just plainly good in unlimited."

dicemasters,3duc6s,chareyzard,4,Sun Jul 19 15:38:26 2015 UTC,"No, that is effect damage. The only ways to deal combat damage is to have an ability that allows you to deal your attack damage to your opponent even when blocked such as Overcrush and Cyclops - Scott Summers."
dicemasters,3duc6s,Necromanticer,2,Sun Jul 19 15:41:55 2015 UTC,Thanks.. Only if Cyclops was a Villain but there are ways to make that happen..   I'll just Hulk Out my Villains to attempt to get free cost Thanos.
dicemasters,3duc6s,Necromanticer,2,Sun Jul 19 16:11:59 2015 UTC,"Cyclops is way too expensive, if you're purchasing a 7 cost, it should win you the game. Instead use the uncommon Ultron Drone and Hulk Out. Your opponent can't stop the damage unless they have Smash! or Distraction, so just bring Human Paladin - Lesser Emerald Enclave for that possibility and you're set."

dicemasters,3duc6s,Necromanticer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:57:24 2015 UTC,"overcrush isn't ability damage?  it's not trample, the character just deals damage under x trigger via an ability."
dicemasters,3duc6s,KoutetsuKaigun,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:22:20 2015 UTC,"No, not technically. The way overcrush works is by redirecting all combat damage in excess of the blockers' defenses to your opponent's life. Redirection effects never change the source of the damage, so damage dealt to your opponent via overcrush is still combat damage that would have been dealt to the defender.  This is what makes the uncommon Ultron Drone combo so well with Thanos - Infinite. If you give it overcrush, the blocking characters are all moved out of the way with the capture, so the full combat damage is dealt to your opponent, thus making Thanos cheaper to purchase."
dicemasters,3duc6s,Magical_Orphan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:37:11 2015 UTC,How about the automatic one point of damage to the opponent that Cheetah - Cursed Archaeologist does?
dicemasters,3duc6s,KoutetsuKaigun,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:37:02 2015 UTC,"Again, this is effect (or indirect) damage. This would not gain you a token. Cheeta's attack would have to get through somehow."
dicemasters,3dt87d,vibetoocool,2,Sun Jul 19 05:50:28 2015 UTC,"Paying 2 of a type of energy is different from rolling a double energy face.  Ultron Drone's global requires you pay two fists. You can get these fists from any number of die, but they have to add up to 2 fists.  Vibe triggers when you roll and do not reroll a double bolt face. This can only be done with bolt character or action dice.  The new stylized arrangement of energy is strictly for style purposes. It does not affect gameplay at all."
dicemasters,3dt87d,Necromanticer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:05:51 2015 UTC,"Wait a second.   Vibe triggers when you roll and do not reroll a double bolt face.   and   The new stylized arrangement of energy is strictly for style purposes. It does not affect gameplay at all.   These are mutually-exclusive statements. It can't be merely cosmetic and also have a specific meaning in the rules. There are three possibilities here:   Double-Bolt means something specific, and hence all cards which show a Double-Bolt refer specifically to the two-bolt faces of some dice; Double-Bolt means nothing and is just for design, so all cards which show a Double-Bolt really mean to say ""two bolt energy""; WizKids made another mistake, and it actually has two meanings depending on the card."
dicemasters,3dt87d,StormyWaters2021,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:13:00 2015 UTC,That is what I was thinking. The only other explanation I can think of is the double fist is different since you are paying for it instead of just rolling for it
dicemasters,3dt87d,StormyWaters2021,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:48:31 2015 UTC,"WK really needs to take time to read through things for clarity. Have outsiders read through all the sets and see what shakes loose.   If it's meant to be that way, it needs to be clearly worded as such.    When you finalize a die and it shows two bolt energy, do X   Dice should be rolled, rerolled, and then finalized.   or leave it the way it is and change all the double-bolt cards to show side-by-side bolts like they were before."

I've submitted a few questions to the WizKids rules team, but there's a lot about capturing that needs some clarification."

She's your best ramp available, and with BEWD, you can make her your focus on knocking her out to cheapen your next buy, therefore putting her into your prep area to roll again right away and get that next dice.  Change Green Arrow for Johnny Storm, and you have your ping machine going.  *Get Johnny out  *Get Zatanna out (Draw her Dice)(Ping via Johnny)  *KO Zatanna using BEWD (she goes to prep)  *Buy something at 2 less cost  *Rinse and repeat.  Doing that alone is putting 2 dice into your prep area each turn."
dicemasters,3dsnmh,Tolk63,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:45:23 2015 UTC,"Definitely considering storm near the top of my list as well as a cyclops field leader... I'm still not totally sold on Zatanna though, I didn't really find myself in need of more dice and if I'm using blue eyes it'll be on bolt characters w/ low fielding cost like Scarlet Witch to feed Firestorm's ability.  The other thing is that I have a tsarina I can use but I don't really see her fitting into my team and I feel like it's just a cheap OP addition. I am however considering buying a gobby because that actually fits amazing well.  I'm also thinking about manticore so in a tight spot I can cycle through my dice with pyro and continuously ping my opponent."

dicemasters,3dsiq2,NoxTempus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:53:28 2015 UTC,"From an Overcrush card in DC:    (Damage dealt in excess of blockers’ health is dealt to opponent.)   If you use an Ultron Drone to capture the blocker, Ultron Drone is still technically ""blocked"", but there is a blocker health value of 0, because the blocker has been removed from the attack zone. So Ultron Drone's entire attack value goes to the opponent.  Official ruling from WizKids: http://www.wizkidseventsystem.com/bb/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4425&p=10702&hilit=Overcrush#p10702"

For example, several of the characters don't have the ""while active"" text which has confused a lot of players (uncommon Lex Luthor, rare Sinestro come to mind immediately). Also Aquaman's text as-is reduces the purchase cost of Justice League characters for all players, and Wonder Woman reduces field cost of JL characters for all players.

Human Paladin is gaining popularity and the Uncommon Stirge can be blocked by adventurers.  The super rare gives you the ""sure thing"" unblockable if it's able to attack alone. Swarm is also a great perk. With the Stirge you're generally only going to be attacking with one of them, so keeping one fielded still gives you a perk.  Also, couple the SR Stirge with anger issues and/or transfer power and you're going to get in and do some pretty serious damage."

Star-lord, Gamora, Rocket, Groot, Starhawk, Moondragon  Luckily Starhawk and Moondragon also have the avengers affiliation and can benefit them so it's easy to add someone like Wasp or Captain Marvel (who is currently a Guardian in the comics but not DM)"
dicemasters,3dnh3t,GreenLanternNova,2,Sun Jul 19 04:36:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and you can always use the Infiltrate BA to make certain characters Guardians. Star-Lord's little +1/+1 boost make them pretty fun, especially if you're buffing Rocket with extra attackers and everybody else with Groot's help. They can become a pretty formidable attack force (and Gamora's death touch is super fun). I think there are better combos out there, but as it stands the Guardians are a pretty fun, if not goofy, little team comp."

dicemasters,3do6c8,madraykin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:37:51 2015 UTC,"Teamwatch means that you trigger the ability any time an affiliated character is fielded. With Hawkeye, he is an Avenger, so whenever you field another Avenger, you deal 1 damage to a target opposing character. If the teamwatch character gains or loses affiliations (such as by Iron Man's global), the affiliations that trigger his teamwatch also change.  Teamwork on the other hand, allows you to duplicate the effect one time for a character that shares an affiliation with the target character. Assemble for instance allows you to search your bag for a character die, field it, and then repeat for another affiliated character. If you target an unaffiliated character, teamwork does not proc and you do not get to repeat the ability for another unaffiliated character.  For all of your questioned examples: No, the Teamwork effect can only proc once."
dicemasters,3do6c8,Necromanticer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:48:09 2015 UTC,"Teamwatch -- Okay, the gain/lose affiliation makes sense, but the specific question I was asking was in regards to multiple dice of a given character satisfying the affiliation requirement getting fielded. Does fielding a second (third, fourth...) Hawkeye die trigger Hawkeye - Clint's Teamwatch ability? Captain America will satisfying the trigger when fielded -- but will he only do so the first time a Cap die is fielded while no Cap dice are already fielded?  Did I miss a rule somewhere that we can't simultaneously field multiple dice of a given character?  Teamwork-- Ah, I was reading the Teamwork ability as causing the entire Assemble! card text to repeat, including an additional instance of the Teamwork, causing potentially multiple triggers."
dicemasters,3do6c8,Necromanticer,2,Fri Jul 17 22:37:13 2015 UTC,"For teamwatch, it procs every time that you field an affiliated character. It doesn't check to see if you already have that character fielded. You can even proc it with a second copy of the teamwatching character.  Teamwork says ""repeat this effect"". It is not an effect itself, rather it is a keyword with reminder text. It simply explains how you may target with the ability in question. It does not cause the entire card text to repeat, simply the effect a single time. With the case of Assemble! you would field a character and be able to duplicate the effect of fielding a character for a character affiliated with the first target."

In hundreds and hundreds of packs opened at multiple drafts from just about every set, as well as those that mine and other folks close to me have opened to this point, I've never seen it. I know it happens on occasion, but it's incredibly rare.   If you want a perfect manufacturing process in any area, you're going to be looking for a long time. Especially gaming.  You know nearly all of these board games are manufactured in China with little to no oversight from the companies who publish them, right? FFG, Asmodee, WizKids, all of them. It happens even to companies with great reputations. Like FFG with Netrunner. ... everyone's Paper Wall has the Ssubroutines misprint on it.   Modern Masters had some problems for WotC.

I had had absolutely zero instances of these types of problems with the past sets but with the ten packs I bought of AoU I had two in which the dice didn't match the cards, along with the expected missing rarity stripes.   The rarity stripes issue is one thing, because yeah it doesn't effect gameplay. The cards/dice though....we play this game very casually. We don't buy gravity feeds. We pick up a few packs here and there and add a few characters and their dice to our collection and have a nice laid back fun time with it. So to us, those two packs and their contents are absolute wastes until we happen to open corresponding stuff (hopefully!) sometime down the line. That, to me, is pretty bad. It's like if Pandemic 2.0 came with the board to a different game. That's how useful those packs are to me right now.   I understand manufacturing errors. My problem is the response to it. Wiz Kids made a website post and called it good. Because they knew they could because they knew people would talk themselves into accepting it and buy it anyway. When products show up damaged/faulty from Plaid Hat Games they immediately replace all those parts through the mail to customers at their own expense. Sure comparing a $1 pack to a $40 board game isn't completely fair but I do think we've seen a trend from WizKids of increasingly poor quality control and a bit of an indifference about it.   Yeah things are printed in China but they get to sign off on final proofs and demo sets from THOSE VERY PROOFS to make sure that's what they want. It's China's fault isn't always as true as it seems. I work in importing products manufactured overseas. Very often the things we as a nation chalk up to well that's just China for ya is very much more a case of well that's just companies not doing due diligence for ya.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I tend to be very forgiving about this type of thing and I just can't stop getting a worse and worse taste in my mouth about WizKids."
dicemasters,3dnlch,CasualToast,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:10:21 2015 UTC,These production runs are so long from start to delivery and it is known that the manufacturers themselves are getting more and more backlogged. There are a lot of moving parts to this.   And while there are a few issues I think it is unfair to judge the whole set by it. They've done so much to add cohesion and whatnot with this one that I think it's a big step forward in terms of better codifying DM as a whole.

I appreciate the non-vitriolic response to my frustration. We really enjoy this game and were very excited for the new set and it was deeply disheartening to experience such results from our first packs.  Hopefully as production on AoU continues these things are resolved and we can invest in packs that don't suffer these issues!"

I play pretty often with my boyfriend and friends and we haven't really thought about any of the other themes since - If you want to play with the full range and a mixed theme, I think AvX is the best starter, but as a standalone product I think D&D + boosters is the most coherent and nuanced."

dicemasters,3dmvvg,petersox,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:47:04 2015 UTC,"Well, there are three different things to sort out, so here's hoping I don't miss over anything:  When you roll an action face on an action die, you may use the ability of the action card the action die belongs to (with BAC's, this is denoted by color). The bursts on the action faces activate extra or more potent effects from the related action card, but not all action cards have burst effect. Bursts are just there to let you know if you can get anything extra.  When the player used a lightning bolt to boost a character's attack, he was activating a ""global ability"". Many different cards, both characters and actions, have global abilities. These are marked by the text ""Global:"" and red text. These can be used by either player when they have priority, regardless of whether or not the card is active. Priority is a complicated topic, but it basically means that the active player (the player who's turn it is) gets to do as many things as they like before the inactive player gets a chance to do things.  Combat works a bit similarly to Magic the Gathering. Once a character is blocked, he is blocked for the rest of the turn, even if his blockers goes away. After the attacking player declares his attackers, the defending player can declare blocks however they like and can assign multiple character to block a single attacking character. When characters fight, they deal damage equal to their attack value (the top right value) to their engaged opponents however they like. If a character takes damage equal to their defense (the lower right value), they are knocked out and sent to the prep area to be rolled next turn. Damage accumulates over the course of a turn, but it cleared away at the end of the turn. The attack step proceeds in the following steps:   The active player declares all attackers. When attacking effects activate. The inactive player declares blockers. When blocking/blocked effects activate. Globals can be played and the active player may also use action dice. Damage is assigned. Damage resolves and knockouts are applied. Damage clears and the turn ends."
dicemasters,3dmvvg,Necromanticer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:03:57 2015 UTC,Thanks. That cleared most of my questions up. When combat occurs does the attacker compare his attack value to the blocker as well as the blocker compare his attack value to the attackers defense. This is where I am getting confused.
dicemasters,3dmvvg,Necromanticer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:36:01 2015 UTC,"That is correct, both the blockers and the attacker are considered engaged. When they assign damage, the attacker assigns its damage to the blocker and visa versa. When a character is dealt damage equal to or greater than their defense, they are knocked out."
dicemasters,3dmvvg,dormedas,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:33:50 2015 UTC,"So here's a totally made up scenario. Let's say I have a 4a, 5d cheater and I attack. My opponent has a 3a, 3d character they block with. My 4a is higher than their 3d so I ko them. Since they are ko'd do they still apply there attack to me?"
dicemasters,3dmh7q,Neverethe,3,Fri Jul 17 13:48:21 2015 UTC,"The best way to use him is alongside effects that trigger when you take damage. This means characters like Hulk or the new Captain Americas. This works out in a way since they're all fist characters meaning that you can start with a bunch of Kobolds and build into these bad boys. You could also bring life-gain to counter the damage you're taking.  Any time you can benefit from both of you taking damage, you'll want to bring Electro."

dicemasters,3dmpnt,DelayedSword,2,Fri Jul 17 14:58:58 2015 UTC,"Very easily. We have two ways of doing it: Momentary captures + overcrush, or perma-captures for removal.   The first method is to use the uncommon Ultron Drone alongside 3 other cards: Kobolds for cheap fists, Goblin Attack Force's uncommon for the ""must block"" global, and an overcrush die like Hulk Out or Anger Issues.  Perma-captures relies on Gelatinous Cube alongside 3 other cards: Kobolds for cheap fists, Gamorah's uncommon for the guaranteed kill global, and Deadpool or Goblin Attack Force's uncommon for their ""must block"" effects.  If you want to make these teams mean, toss in Ultron - New World Order for the extra burn or Imprisoned for even more captures (but never both). Other interesting choices are Deadman - Boston Brand, Mindflayer - Epic Humanoid, and Minotaur - Paragon Humanoid for their more reliable captures."
dicemasters,3dmpnt,Necromanticer,2,Fri Jul 17 15:09:28 2015 UTC,"I'm digging cube,  kobold,  and Deadpool. I don't have attack force or gammora yet,  but will attempt to acquire them. Ultron drones have the global block too,  but more expensive.   Will definitely add ultron to the mix as well as minotaur as he fits with overcrush well.   I'll likely throw in rogue to capture from the used pile. Thanks for the suggestions. I'll likely reply when I get the deck built."
dicemasters,3dmpnt,jhoratio,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:18:46 2015 UTC,"Go for it! Imprisonment would be kind of weird, since you'd immediately deal damage and return everyone right away, but Rogue would be a cool addition! I love Rogue so any way to fit her into a team I'm for!"
dicemasters,3dmpnt,CovertDad,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:03:47 2015 UTC,"How, exactly, do the Ultron/Ultron Clones Capture when Blocking effects work?  Who gets damaged, who doesn't?  Does Overcrush trigger, etc?"
dicemasters,3dmpnt,jonyet,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:39:24 2015 UTC,"So,  one of the ultron cards states that the first time an opponents character is captured,  deal 3 damage to that player.   Uncommon ultron drones state that any character blocking ultron drone is captured. Damage is dealt to the opponent equal to the fielding cost for that die face.   Uncommon Ultron drone also has a global that states to pay double fist to force a character to block ultron drone.   Now,  overcrush states that all blockers must be removed before dealing damage to the opponent. In the case of an ultron drone with overcrush,  he forces a block and captures the die. This removes the blocker,  allowing ultron drone to do all of its damage to the opponent. This doesn't work without overcrush because the die is technically still blocked,  even if it captures it's blocker.   Ideally,  you would have an overcrush die on a level 3 ultron clone,  ultron,  and an opposing character. Pay the global to force a block,  capturing that character. 3 damage to the opponent comes from ultron effect. Add damage from fielding cost of the die you captured,  and add the damage of the ultron drone. I slammed somebody for nine damage in one turn doing this without sacrificing my wall."
dicemasters,3dmpnt,GreenLanternNova,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:07:24 2015 UTC,"after you added damage from ultron drone (solely because you had overcrush) did you not also attack with Ultron himself, since the opponents only available blocker was captured? or did they have more characters than the one captured?"
dicemasters,3dmpnt,thegreenlanternguy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:56:40 2015 UTC,"While discussing capturing how do the common Ultron drones work?  Do they capture all blockers?

In just about every game where they exist, a ""counter"" is just some form of marker - coins, small stones, dice, what have you - that can indicate a number. They give them names to keep straight what they do, like in magic: the gathering a +1/+1 counter is different from a storage counter etc. etc. They almost nver have an actual specific item made to track them, you just use whatever's available and choose for yourself how to keep different types seperate."

dicemasters,3dl93i,Spiral0Architect,2,Fri Jul 17 04:31:29 2015 UTC,"This... this is a good question. The wording is ambiguous and leads to 2 possible interpretations:  1.) Wolverine attacks an opposing character, meaning that the targeted villain is a substitute for your opponent. This means that if Wolverine goes unblocked, he will go to used and deal his whole attack value to the target character regardless of overcrush; if he is blocked, he will not damage the target character unless he can overcrush his way through.  2.) This is a fancy way of saying that the targeted character is engaged with Wolverine, but is never declared as a blocker. Essentially this will negate the targets ""when assigned to block"" effect and guarantee that it is counted as a blocker for Wolverine even if it could not normally block (such as common X-23). Though your opponent can declare extra blockers, you are still allowed to assign damage as you choose and any overcrush damage dealt goes through to your opponent.  I favor the second interpretation since it changes the game the least and lends itself to the spirit of Wolverines effect, designed to allow him to assassinate villains, not to be foiled by a single bodyguard."

dicemasters,3diuyb,WetFifty,2,Thu Jul 16 17:00:05 2015 UTC,"I would judge that it would be from your Used Pile since that's what is stated on Polymorph ""Swap a fielded character with a non-NPC character from that player's used pile."" I assume the fielded character would be from your used pile, since you are in control of the die.   Now as far as where the die goes when swapped, you would refer to the rulebook under Capturing, Controlling, and Copying:   ""If the controlled die is sent to your Prep Area or Used Pile, it goes to your opponent’s Prep Area instead. Otherwise, when your control of the die ends (at the end of the turn or when your controlling character is KO’d), return the controlled die to your opponent, placing it in whatever area you took it from. Your die (that was controlling the other die) remains where it was.""   (Edit: The die returns to your opponent's field if KO'd or at the end of the turn. My B, it was right there in the rules. But Polymorph would put the die in your opponent's Prep.)  That's my 2 cents at least."
dicemasters,3diuyb,JakeSalvage,2,Thu Jul 16 17:40:35 2015 UTC,"Polymorph swaps a fielded character with a character from the used pile of the player controlling the selected character. Since Possession gave you control of the character, you would swap it with a character from your used pile. (Note: The used pile is technically shared, so the die still returns to your opponent's bag, not your own.)  All effects end during the cleanup step unless otherwise stated. Possession does not state that the change of control lasts any longer than the turn, so the effect ends at the end of your turn and the character returns to the control of its owner. In the case of the Polymorph situation, the character has left the field, so its control is moot. The control of the Polymorphed character is unaffected by the Possession scenario, so nothing in particular happens to the character of yours that you polymorphed in."
dicemasters,3djbkv,EricBinNYC,5,Thu Jul 16 19:00:01 2015 UTC,"If you're looking to play semi-competently there's a few characters that will be pretty high up their on a list of what you want to play:   Beast - Genetic Expert/Mutate #666 | He's very cheap and gives you bonuses for blocking and helps counter early aggression. Human Torch - ""Flame On!"" | He's a pretty incredible card and once you sit him on the field, your opponent will be on the clock. Hulk - Jade Giant | A massive statline and some heavy removal, this guys has it all. He's a big purchase, but if you can afford him, he will do great things for you. Storm - African Priestess | Strong removal on a cheap die, she'll allow you to deal with your opponent's threats early on in the game. Spider-Man - Webslinger | He'll allow your whole field to attack uncontested, allowing you to end a game after you've built yourself up. Angel - Air Transport | He goes great with Human Torch because he fields two characters, allowing you to ping your opponent twice. Kitty Pryde - Ariel | Just good cheap stats or energy depending upon what you need. Wolverine - The Best There Is | If you apply Overcrush with Thrown Car or Hulk Out, he's a powerful win condition due to his incredible attack stats. Captain America - The Firs Avenger | He'll keep you healthy and mitigate burn effects against you throughout the game. Not to mention his die is pretty powerful on its own. Hawkeye - Trickshot | Once again, good stats for the price, but he also allows you to force your opponent to make hard decisions. Free damage or blocker manipulation, either way he's going to be a value character. Iron Man - Big Man | Good stats for a bargain. Not much more to it than that.   These are all good characters to bring to your team if you're only working with the starters. as you can see, AvX was a bit imbalanced, but there're gems to be found in the other sets as well. The two cards I would say are almost a necessity are Human Torch and Hulk. They are almost top-tier cards, only beaten out by their uncommon versions, so you'll never go wrong bringing them on your team.  Good luck and welcome to the hobby!

That said, you can also pick up a similar solution to that issue on Human Paladin common from DnD set. But for just starters, go with the advice above.

dicemasters,3dj8qs,JakeSalvage,2,Thu Jul 16 18:58:41 2015 UTC,"Well, if the perfect model was achieved where you kept getting lightning bolts, I would say yes, but realistically you're not going to keep rolling bolts forever. Also, what would that achieve? Unless the dice were being used for something else, they'd clear at the beginning of your turn into your used anyways. I mean, you could use Lightning Bolt (BAC) to zap your opponent's fielded characters I guess. But otherwise you'd just be cycling through your bag. It also says keep any (1 bolt), so (2 bolt) wouldn't count, so it'd be a 1/6 chance on both your bolt characters and sidekick dice (? wouldn't count according to the text) which is a pretty low chance of doing this forever. If we're going quantum suicide theory on this, sure, if all the dice you have in your Used Area and your Dice Bag are capable of rolling a (1 bolt), then you could do this forever if you always rolled at least one bolt."
dicemasters,3dj8qs,Pithecius,2,Thu Jul 16 18:50:23 2015 UTC,"Could someone do a formula for this? It's driving me crazy... assuming your chance of rolling one side (1 bolt) on at least one of both dice is 11/36, and X is the amount of times you successfully get at least (1 bolt), what would be the formula? (Edit: also factoring in that for Manticore you would at least have to roll 2 bolts 10 times (prob 1/36))"
dicemasters,3dj8qs,JakeSalvage,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:07:57 2015 UTC,"You have a 50% chance of rolling bolts on character dice, so it is only 1/4 chance of a bolt on both dice, if I understand the odds."
dicemasters,3dj8qs,JakeSalvage,2,Thu Jul 16 19:23:35 2015 UTC,"Even then, the probability is 1/(410) = a 1 in 1048576 chance to do 20 damage with the Manticore. (edit: I think that's wrong since I just looked up the Manticore ability and it's anytime you roll (2 bolts) so not only would they have to be character dice, the odds would be 2/6 or 1/3 per... the math hurts my brain.)"

dicemasters,3diqay,KenoftheDead666,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:00:16 2015 UTC,"don't believe he stops it in any way.  except maybe the global reducing the damage a little bit.  the mjolnir in question deal 6-8 damage to all villains in play, jocasta is a villian and as such takes 6-8 damage and then redirects it to the opponent.  as you will be the active player the turn you use mjolnir they will never get a chance to activate globals to say injure jocasta before you trigger this action dice, save for preventative or redirect globals they will likely never get a chance to interact with the play."
dicemasters,3diqay,KenoftheDead666,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:03:59 2015 UTC,"I was talking about the global, reduce damage from a character ability to 1. This is still a mean combo, but Human Paladin can certainly help."

dicemasters,3dj2hk,calisk,3,Thu Jul 16 18:22:48 2015 UTC,"I understand where you're coming from, but presently, big-burn is a stronger archetype than little-burn. The dominant characters like Green Goblin, Black Manta, Ultron Drone, Jocasta, and Firestorm are hurt more by Super Soldier being out than by First Avenger. It's true that First Avenger helps against weenie burn like Cheetah, but that's easy enough to tank your way through and get to your big guys. The real trick is surviving big chunks of damage like ""Gobby"" hitting the field with 4 sidekicks out, or Ultron Drone capturing half your field.  Super Soldier may be less diverse, but in the current meta, he's more powerful."

Magneto - Magnetic Monster : Although he might be a rarity, this guy is going to shut down whole strategies in a way I think is even more effective than the SR Constantine. Wasp - Founding Avenger : This isn't just going to hurt the use of PXG, it's going to have a lasting effect on the entire game of globals. I know Jinzo hasn't had as great an effect, but I'm entirely sure that it's because it's a card from YGO and because it's a 6-cost. Cutting that cost in half with some pretty decent stats means she's going to shape the pace of this game. Giant Man - Pym Particles : The ability is awesome. He can effectively become a 7/7 for a zero fielding cost, and he's a 4-drop mask. The mechanics make it risky, but it can work, and I do think he'll be a surprise hit with teams like Patch Avengers. Captain Marvel - Inspiration : Although you could certainly point out the new Beast or Captain America - The First Avenger, Captain Marvel is an aggressive player with the most reliable mechanism for life gain in the game, in my opinion. Because she's a brute, she'll be doing constant combat damage, and she's got great stats to boot. She might not be as competitive a choice as Beast or Captain America, but I definitely think she's going to be influential in the creation of teams that work hard for recovery. She may not be the first character purchased in a game, but she's a sound strategy for getting a few extra turns for a win.   That being said, there are bound to be cards and characters that we won't see coming that will shape the meta, as happened with Spider-Bomb and High Hopes. My hopes is that the game gets a lot more fluid in the future, but these, I think, are going to make a big splash."
dicemasters,3di64k,calisk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:49:29 2015 UTC,"As with any global that effects how attacks and blocks are declared, you must activate the effect in the main phase or else it has no effect. (you can still use it in the attack step, but blockers will already have been declared and it won't affect anything.)"
dicemasters,3di64k,Necromanticer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:57:18 2015 UTC,"k cool, not quite as good as I hoped but oh well.  in the case of forcing jocasta to be blocked they can then remove her after the cost has been paid."
dicemasters,3di64k,Necromanticer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:04:11 2015 UTC,"Provided they have the resources left for it, yes."
dicemasters,3dj30r,WetFifty,3,Thu Jul 16 17:58:20 2015 UTC,"When a character with overcrush is blocked and the blocked character is removed from the engagement, all remaining damage is applied to the defending player. In this case, the defending die is captured, so all the damage is applied to the defending player and since the die was still blocked, they return to the field afterwards.  This means that the new Ultron Drones make incredibly good overcrushers and there's very little ways you can stop them."
dicemasters,3dj30r,Necromanticer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:06:10 2015 UTC,"why is this the case? they made rulings before that the champions need to be ko'd for the damage to carry over, why would this scenario allow it?"
dicemasters,3dj30r,calisk,3,Thu Jul 16 18:08:06 2015 UTC,"Overcrush deals damage in excess of the blockers' defense to the opponent's life. When all blockers are captured, they are no longer blocking the attacking character. However, since Dice Masters works under the ""once blocked, alwasy blocked"" system of combat, the attacking character was still blocked and would not normally deal its damage to your opponent. However, since there are no characters blocking the die, overcrush means that it now deals all of its attack as damage.  The ruling that all blockers must be knocked out in order for overcrush to apply still counts in this instance. The trick is, there are no blockers that need knocking out. Because they have been captured and removed from play, there are no characters blocking the attacker in question and he overcrushes through without a problem."

dicemasters,3dj30r,netherspirit1982,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:31:00 2015 UTC,Wouldn't they go to the used pile? They dealt combat damage to a player. Everyone I play with has said that if they deal combat damage to a player they go to the used pile
dicemasters,3dj30r,Antiping,3,Thu Jul 16 18:22:37 2015 UTC,"No, overcrush does allow them to deal combat damage to a player, but a character only ever goes to the used pile if it was not blocked. The damage dealt to the player is completely irrelevant, it just so happens that in order to deal combat damage to players, a character usually has to go through unblocked.  If my Thanos - Infinite attack as a 9/9 with overcrush, and you block with a sidekick, I'd deal 8 damage to you and return to the field. This is part of what makes overcrush so powerful, it allows you to keep your characters on the field while still dealing damage to your opponent (assuming they don't get knocked out by the defender)."
dicemasters,3dj30r,Necromanticer,-2,Thu Jul 16 18:25:46 2015 UTC,OK. Well I'm done with dice masters as of AoU then.

dicemasters,3dj30r,TheGreatWar,0,Fri Jul 17 07:28:09 2015 UTC,It doesn't become unblockable. I could deal with it if it actually had unblockable written on the card instead. Its the stupidly OP interaction it has with overcrush that's killing it for me. Not to mention it can FORCE AN OPPONENTS CHARACTER TO BLOCK IT.  Oh and let's not forget what happens when you also have Ultron on the field...

dicemasters,3di44b,drakemacgavin,2,Thu Jul 16 13:31:48 2015 UTC,"When you knock out a character, it goes to the ""Prep Area"". All the dice in your prep area are added to your roll at that start of your turn.  For instance, if your opponent attacks with Captain America, and you block with a single sidekick, the sidekick will be knocked out. At the start of your turn, you'll draw your 4 dice and add that sidekick to the initial roll and reroll.  Because of this, there's a strategy to not knocking out your opponent's characters if you can avoid it since it gives them more dice/energy to play with and can give them bigger purchases. At the same time, you usually need to clear your opponent's field in order to win. This leads to some mindgames and strategy that you'll get more acquainted with as you play."
dicemasters,3di44b,Necromanticer,2,Thu Jul 16 13:39:38 2015 UTC,"that mind game is why I like thanos SR in villains, it removes your opponents ability to let attackers through.  imagine how you would deal with jocasta, you'd probably force her to attack, but what if forcing her to attack permantly lowers the cost of thanos, and you get to bring this anti attacking logic without even paying a single resource."

dicemasters,3di44b,Necromanticer,2,Thu Jul 16 15:29:08 2015 UTC,"I guess an additional question I have now is if all of this is correct: If I attack with a character and it is NOT blocked, after damage resolution, it goes to the used pile. If I attack with that same character (2/2) and the defending player blocks (1/1) then the defender would be ko'ed and my character would go back to the field. Lastly, if I attack with a character (1/2) and the defending player defends (2/1) then both characters ko each other and go to the KO pile?"
dicemasters,3di44b,Necromanticer,2,Thu Jul 16 22:17:22 2015 UTC,"Bingo. Whenever a character attacks and is not blocked, even characters that have 0 attack and deal no damage to the player, they go to the used pile. When blocked or blocking and not assigned enough damage to knock them out, a character returns to the field. when blocked or blocking and assigned damage equal to or greater than their defense, they are knocked out."
dicemasters,3di44b,Necromanticer,2,Thu Jul 16 23:12:04 2015 UTC,"Another question that I hope is okay to ask am I'm not bothering you:  When I leave energy in my reserve and, at the beginning of my next turn it would be moved to my used pile, can I use it before it moves or is it just gone?"
dicemasters,3di44b,Necromanticer,2,Fri Jul 17 01:25:50 2015 UTC,"No, you can only use globals or triggered abilities during the main and the proper period of the attack step (and even those times, only when you have ""priority""). If your opponent passes you priority at the end of their main step and you do not use the energy, but instead pass priority back, your opponent has the opportunity to end their turn and you will not get a chance to use the energy.  In all technicality, it goes to your used pile at during your opponent's cleanup step, not the beginning of your turn, but that shouldn't ever come up as far as I can tell.  No worries about the questions. I don't mind answering, and the more people who know the right way to play, the better!"
dicemasters,3di44b,calisk,2,Fri Jul 17 01:35:51 2015 UTC,"Alrighty, then maybe one of these questions that I keep asking can stump you one of these days!  (Or at least you can view them as trivia questions)  What is the purpose of team affiliations?"

dicemasters,3dhxuc,Necromanticer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:50:01 2015 UTC,"If that were the case, there would be no burst on his level 3 face.  The specific ruling on this is that when you cannot complete all of an effect, you simply do as much as you can, unless you cannot complete the cost. The spinning up is not part of the cost, simply an additional effect. So when he's level 3 and you take non-combat damage, he just gains you a life and does not spin at all."

dicemasters,3dhxuc,thetrevdor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:47:18 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see that specific ruling cited, considering that that would be a major ruling with ramifications for play throughout the game. The wording on the card suggests that you'd have to be able to spin him up in order to get the life gain. I know there's a burst on his level 3 face, but it could be yet another of the many weird things about this set that shouldn't have come to pass (like, for example, Starlord costing 4 shield)."
dicemasters,3dhxuc,calisk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:35:12 2015 UTC,"it really doesn't suggest you need to spin it up, the ""also"" is referring to the trigger, i.e taking damage, not the spinning of the dice, it means two effects are going off and they are not in any way conditional on each other.  I would like a ruling as well, but I don't in any way doubt the end result.  he triggers when you take damage not when he spin up the dice."

Overcrush functions by redirecting all damage in excess of the blockers' defenses to your opponent's life. Accordingly, you must first assign all that damage to Jocasta and then she will redirect it all to your life."
dicemasters,3dhvtr,Necromanticer,-1,Thu Jul 16 13:06:07 2015 UTC,"actually according to the most recent ruling i've seen on overcrush, you have to knock out all the targets to deal the overcrush damage.  it's a ruling I disagree with but whatever.  as such no if jocasta is still on the field after the attack then over crush will never deal it's damage.  my question with jocasta is if she is blocked by two heroes how do you decide which hero deals it's damage first or is it simultaneous, if it's simultaneous you could have fun polymorphing her with a spider man."
dicemasters,3dhvtr,calisk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:08:11 2015 UTC,"Well, combat damage is simultaneous, and ""If simultaneous effects are controlled by the same player, that player chooses the order of those effects."" so, I would assume that the blocking player can decide the order of the effects. I recommend letting the Sidekick hit her first ;)"

dicemasters,3dfp2x,anossXVIII,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:22:11 2015 UTC,You absolutely must have at least 1 starter to play at all. The starter has your sidekick dice and basic actions that are necessary to play the game. You put yourself at a strategic disadvantage if you don't buy all the starters because of the basic actions. I have no idea about getting starter contents as singles.
dicemasters,3dfp2x,KenoftheDead666,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:26:53 2015 UTC,You can get starter singles online.
dicemasters,3dfp2x,neuromorph,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:24:36 2015 UTC,"Few stores actually sell the cards in the starters separately, although there are a few online. Honestly, though, getting the starters is usually a wise decision: they are the only way to get access to the Basic Action cards necessary to play the game, and they are the only place you can get the sidekick dice which are the actual mechanic for playing the game. You literally cannot play without at least one starter.  That said, what you decide to buy is up to you. If you really think that you don't need all of the Basic Action cards or that you don't need all the characters in the starter, then don't buy them. Many of the cards that come in the starter are only so-so, and you might be able to find the ones that are legitimately great elsewhere. But you will need at least one to even sit down for a game."

dicemasters,3dfp2x,thetrevdor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:17:00 2015 UTC,Plus a lot of stores will only allow basic actions from the current set in a rainbow draft so you'll need the starter for that draft at least.

Maria Hill - Uncommon/Rare | These girls are going to get you all the energy you need for your big purchases. Pick them alongside a shield character or two and you're going to be in a much better spot than your opponent when it comes to ramp. Ultron Drone - Un/Common | Blocker finagling is very good and they just have great stats for their price. Their global is also very nice and can do great things if you use it at the right times.   I won't take the time to go through the rares and onwards, but suffice it to say that there's quite a few good rares and you should never pass over a super rare."

Since you assigned Cyclops to attack with him, he did not attack alone, regardless of any Distractions or even knockouts that happen after the fact. If you attack with Wolverine and any other dice, it doesn't matter what happens from there, Wolverine's effect will not proc."

dicemasters,3dc1en,d_gucci,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:42:36 2015 UTC,"Wolverine's text is ""When Wolverine attacks alone..."" the definition of ""attack"" is moving the character from the field to the attack zone, not when the character deals damage. I think this is where you are getting confused. Since you moved both Wolverine and Cyclops to the attack zone, you have attacked with more than one character, and therefore cannot satisfy wolverine's text; regardless of what happens after this phase."

As such, he would deal his damage and his target's effect would be negated before it went off. The one exception to this being redirection effects such as Jocasta since they redirect damage rather than triggering when damage is taken. However, damage redirection will not redirect the effect, so Jocasta's die will lose its ability after redirecting the incoming damage, effectively making Loki a glorified Magic Missile global against her."

dicemasters,3d9kqp,Arbiterchrono,2,Tue Jul 14 15:52:38 2015 UTC,"The Zombie Magneto from AoU will pretty much shut down Gobby (along with the other big 2 SRs, Tsarina and Constantine) and wouldn't the Uncommon Manticore render his ability pretty much useless?"
dicemasters,3d9kqp,GoGoNJDevil,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:59:06 2015 UTC,"Yep! Along with common Doctor Doom and rare Venom. (Unless they're running Sidekick buffs.)  Zombie Magneto is really cool, but cost 6 is still pretty steep when facing down a Tsarina rush.   My big complaint is that Tsarina (and to a lesser extent gobby) are really cheap to purchase and field, where most of the good counters are either SRs or clunky/high purchase and fielding cost to run.  Its sort of like, if you tech against gobby, you weaken your match up against tsarina. If you go your anti Tsarina plan, your opponent just transitions into Hulk which counters your anti-Tsarina plan, and usually can just continue to get maximum efficiency out of Widow.  The card they made that ""Counters"" some of the trouble characters in DM is a sr and actually just makes it more difficult because the team that runs all the best characters runs it as well which makes the whole team better with practically no downside.  I'm hoping Ultron and War of Light will mix things up a bit, but right now I'm a bit worried about the health of the game... :("
dicemasters,3d9kqp,GoGoNJDevil,2,Tue Jul 14 17:19:41 2015 UTC,"Well...constantine is the best Tsarina blocker...and as for Zombie Magneto...BEG or PXG will help you get him out...I also think that using BEG with uncommon Red Skull is a great way to get much bigger cards out.  Odds are most opponents would rather let their opponent ramp rather that hurt themselves.  Also, this has a lot to do with the infancy of Dice Masters.  MTG has had plenty of cards banned and restricted and even Heroclix has golden and modern age.  I have a feeling that eventually AvX/UxM and possibly Yugioh will be restricted."
dicemasters,3d9kqp,dethegreat,3,Tue Jul 14 17:27:02 2015 UTC,"constantine is the best Tsarina blocker   False.  Beast - Genetic Expert is a hard Tsarina counter, and a great card to have in general.  Constantine is an annoyance to Widow at best.  Proof:  World tourney."
dicemasters,3d9kqp,GoGoNJDevil,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:18:47 2015 UTC,Truth.  I stand corrected.  Constantine is still a killer card.  Definitely one of the top 3.
dicemasters,3d9kqp,dethegreat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:47:09 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, Constantine - Hellblazer shuts off a lot of decent tech against other characters.

dicemasters,3d9kqp,dethegreat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:29:40 2015 UTC,"COnstantine IS an amazing card.  I just feel he's much better suited for ""When fielded"" characters."
dicemasters,3d9kqp,dethegreat,2,Tue Jul 14 21:46:45 2015 UTC,"Gobby is, IMO, the best card around.  It can consistently win in 4 turns if given the chance (or if your dice roll bad).  It's impossible to keep him on the field, due to BEG.  And if you do get a Constantine or a Torch out, a smart Gobby player is going to have Phoenix, or Mr. Phantastic along to force you to attack with them.  An entirely Gobby-centric team may even have along a sidekick buff or two to help push through the last few points of damage with an all out swing.  He demands multiple cards to answer him when set up right, and forces the opponent to stop Gobby, rather than setting up their own win conditions."
dicemasters,3d9kqp,d_gucci,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:24:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah I see what you mean. I think the main weakness of Gobby is how vulnerable and high variance Sidekicks are. Anything over 1 damage per fielding is pretty scary though and adds up fast.  That's my main point about Dice Masters right now. It's really awkward devoting resources to countering your opponents plan, Especially if they're going first. You're only reward for going second is seeing your opponents buy order and being able to react to there first purchase, and there's pretty much nothing effective that you can do to really take advantage of that and punish your opponent.   I'm not one to just quit, and I really do enjoy the game, but I'm having a lot of difficulty coming up with decent teams that don't just fold to some of the things we're talking about."
dicemasters,3d9kqp,notsnivyscott,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:10:34 2015 UTC,"It can, and has been done.  The thing is that the more cards your opponent devotes to helping Gobby, the fewer win conditions they have.  The most obvious answer is to give everyone on his side of the field -3/-3 with Dr. Doom and Venom.  Sidekicks won't stick unless he was already running a Flying Sidekicks style team, and even then it'll be a miserable time.  This gives you lots of time to win.  The other big thing is to do everything you can to make sure Gobby doesn't leave the field.  There's not much you can do about BEG, but polymorphing a Gobby in the used pile out onto the field hurts them a lot.  So does chump blocking.  The card IS beatable.  So is every other card they've printed so far.  It just takes knowledge and preperation."
dicemasters,3d9kqp,notsnivyscott,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:22:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not arguing that you can't beat a team running these characters, just that these are the characters TO beat. If you can't handle them they'll run you right over.   Getting Doom and Venom out is a costly venture and easily disrupted. For every one of your characters they can probably buy at least two of theirs that will either actively disrupt your ""counter"" or make you dead before they hit.  Something like the Uncommon manticore is actually pretty solid tech as it's a pretty cheap purchase cost for it's ability.  Another thing I've run into is, if your opponent ""feels"" like your character that will wipe their Sidekicks is coming, they'll just swing them all in to get as much value as possible. Sure it's probably better than getting hit with a big Gobby ping, but I find it's less than ideal at certain stages of the game. (Especially bad with the Captain America that knocks them all out and gains you life.)"

dicemasters,3d9kqp,WalterSkinnerFBI,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:04:10 2015 UTC,"Gobby? Easy.  Two of the human Paladins are fantastic answers to Gobby.   A.) Human Paladin - Master Lords Alliance has an active ability that completely negates any damage from when fielded effects.  B.) Human Paladin - Lesser Emerald Enclave has the global that can reduce Gobby damage to 1 for a shield.  Other options include, life gain characters that be pinged consistently (Iron Man + magic Missile FTW) and Stinking Cloud Basic Action that deals 1 damage to all characters (unless they have buffed their sidekicks) which will knock out all sidekicks therefore neutering Gobby.  Of course the most fun flip to Gobby players (assuming you survive long enough to field him) is the Red Eyes Black Dragon - Inferno Blast. When he attacks, he knocks out all sidekicks (regardless of buffs) on the field (both players) and gets a +2A for each one. Any player focusing on Gobby will have little to no defense if you knock out all their sidekicks. Use Hulk Out from AoU or Anger Issues to give this Dragon overcrush and you should have game."
dicemasters,3da90t,johndiddley,3,Tue Jul 14 18:39:37 2015 UTC,There is a Dr. Doom and a Venom that each give minuses to your opponent's attack and defense.  That's a great place to start.  The combined -3/-3 means all but the L3 versions of Torch and Beast get to field and just immediately die.
dicemasters,3da90t,dethegreat,2,Tue Jul 14 18:50:11 2015 UTC,"There several different ways to deal with this, a ""flying sidekicks"" team can work, but it takes too long to get going.    Another poster mentioned a good solution using Dr. Doom and Venom to give your opponents characters negative stats.    Other board sweepers can be a good solution like Hulk - Green Goliath plus an activator.  Green Goliath will also smash his board when he pings you with Johnny Storm.  I think a Patch Avengers team revolved around getting Hulk to clear their board, then attack with double damage avengers.    Using Overcrush can be another way to get damage through his blocker wall.  I made a fun Marvel team using Deadpool - Assassin, Doc. Ock. - Fully Armed, with Ant Man Global to flip their stats when I needed to (and PXG for ramp of course).  I used common Falcon for cheap fist energy.  Deadpool can target his Johnny Storm and flip his A/D to KO him, and Doc. Ock has overcrush (effectively).  If you roll his level 2 side, 4A/8D, flip him to smash some damage to your opponents face.  When Age of Ultron comes out tomorrow there is a new basic Action, Hulk Out, which costs 2 to buy and gives one character overcrush, iirc."
dicemasters,3da90t,vash989,2,Tue Jul 14 19:33:11 2015 UTC,"D&D Prismatic Spray nullifies card text. Hellfire Club Magneto makes it so every time he preps 1 or more dice he takes 1 direct damage. Hulk Out basic action can add Overcrush to a character.  Pick Your Battles basic action makes it so only characters with the same energy type can block attackers.  Theres an action die that I don't have (so I can't tell you the name) from DC starter where you choose one character, and all other non villains cannot block. Characters like Psylock and Purple Worm allow you to KO characters before blockers are announced (Psylock is when fielded) work well."
dicemasters,3da90t,Kaseron,2,Tue Jul 14 19:58:01 2015 UTC,"Take out Captain America, and add Iron Man - Inventor.  When you take one damage from Johnny Storm, use Iron man's global (saving you 1 life each time you do this) to redirect the damage to hulk or another character, wiping your opponent's board.   Another strategy is to change Storm to Goddess of the Plain, in conjunction with distraction. Attack with storm, and use distraction to pull her back, allowing you to wipe the sidekicks (1/6 chance for them to roll character face), and a 50/50 to wipe the character dice. This is a very powerful setup to have on the field, b/c your opponent will know every time you attack he will have to re-roll all his fielded dice, which sucks."

Red Skull's effect simply does not justify his awful stats for that incredibly high fielding cost. He may have been worth it at a 3-cost, but at a 4-cost, he's just not bringing enough to the table for how much he's going to cost you."
dicemasters,3db8z5,Necromanticer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:10:47 2015 UTC,"That's part of the reason I have Polymorph in.  I agree his fielding is brutal, but I like the ramp ability.  Would you rather roll 3 dice or have your opponent prep 2?  I personally would rather not gimp myself."
dicemasters,3db8z5,Necromanticer,2,Tue Jul 14 23:40:22 2015 UTC,"The thing is, Polymorph doesn't help you very much. In order to get the most use out of Red Skull, you're going to need to refield him after and that's where he gets you. Polymorph is good for getting characters out of the used pile and onto the field, not because it allows you to ignore fielding costs. If that's your aim, you're paying 2 dice (Poly and likely a sidekick) in order to get him out, meaning you're still paying through the nose for his ability.  As for how useful his ability is, it largely depends on what they're drawing. If they have a character they need to field coming up, they're going to have 2 dice left over. That's not really enough to buy anything with in the first place, so you're not hampering them in any meaningful way a lot of the time. I'll admit it does hurt to miss out, but given the option, I'd much rather have my opponent buying and fielding Red Skulls than doing almost anything else with their energy. If you're doing something your opponent wants you to do, you're probably not making the right move."

dicemasters,3d92pt,mkremer90,3,Tue Jul 14 13:31:56 2015 UTC,"What my friend and I did when we opened a GF was kind of a draft.  It made the feed opening last hours and made it a ton of fun.  Basically, we each opened 12 packs one at a time.  Without letting the other person see, you ""Draft"" one card from the pack and put the other card in a pile in the middle.  The next person then opens a pack and can either choose a card from the pack or choose one from the pile.  Keep going until each person opens 12 packs.  Then start choosing cards from the piles until all cards are chosen.  Then using your cards, build a team and play a game or two.  I had bought a case of UxM feeds (2 of them) and it took us all weekend to go through them.  It was super fun.  Just make sure to put up a little partition to hide the dice so that the other person can't see what you're drafting."
dicemasters,3d92pt,GoGoNJDevil,2,Tue Jul 14 14:15:12 2015 UTC,"Definitely sounds like an interesting draft method, will have to try this one out, thanks!"

dicemasters,3d92pt,GoGoNJDevil,2,Tue Jul 14 18:58:13 2015 UTC,Definitely possible...and YES!!! Very good.  Especially if you do any Rainbow Drafts in an FLGS.  This is a great way see what cards work well in draft settings.

Make a team from those. Play. Open another 15 packs. Make a team from those. Play. Then put all 30 together and make a team from that. Hopefully you'll each win one from the other games and the third round can be nice and epic."

The starter set is meant for 2 people and includes a set of white dice, basic actions (think of them as common spells) and a few base characters from the movies.  Between the gravity feed and the starter you should have an almost complete set aside from some rare and super rare cards.  You could basically divvy up the dice between you and draft from that pool you opened.  Otherwise could try this: http://dicemasters.com/rainbowdraft.pdf"

dicemasters,3d7j1a,IvorySwings,2,Tue Jul 14 03:10:38 2015 UTC,"Damage happens before effects due to damage happen. That means the unblocked attacker has already damaged you and gone to the used pile before Iron Man's ability can activate.  Once blocked, always blocked.  ALWAYS.  Overcrush deals damage to opponent in excess of the blockers defense if all blockers are KOed.  If an attacker with overcrush is not blocked at all, the attack value goes thru to the opponent just like any other unblocked attacker."
dicemasters,3d7j1a,jhoratio,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:51:25 2015 UTC,"What about with something like Hulk - Anger Issues? While active, when either you or Hulk take damage, Hulk gets +2A and +2D until the end of the turn. Does that modify this attack? For instance, lvl 1 Hulk is a 6/5. If his opponent is a 5/8, is his opponent KOed? Is the Hulk? No one?"
dicemasters,3d7j1a,Cyborg2342,2,Tue Jul 14 17:12:23 2015 UTC,In Hulk Anger Issues case Hulk would immediately receive his bonus and Hulk would not be KOed but neither would his blocker be KOed.  Hulk already dealt his damage and can't deal it out again.  Does this contradict my earlier statement?  Yes.  Is WizKids going to attempt to apply any logical rigor to the rules of this game? No.

I think if they have overcrush it does. I remember reading somewhere on here that it might not though. Since the wording for overcrush states anything OVER the blockers defense goes to the player. So without a blocker it might not go through?  Anyone have a ruling on this?"

dicemasters,3d72co,calisk,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:20:38 2015 UTC,"it's entirely in the jacosta's favor under that scenario.  hulk player will be spending energy every round trying to keep the jacostas down, injuring himself in the process.  meanwhile the jacostas on their turn can deal damage to hulk dealing massive damage to you.  even if you knock out the jacostas they redeploy and ping/force attack hulk dealing massive damage as well.  just not favorable for the hulk, if I saw jacosta I would just not buy hulk, or not bring green goliath at least."
dicemasters,3d72co,Meatman2013,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:15:42 2015 UTC,"How is Hulk injuring himself?  On my turn, I can use globals first.  So, if I Magic Missile Jacosta, she then deals one damage to me the player, which in turn triggers GG Hulk, dealing damage to opposing characters, but her ability no longer does anything because she has already triggered.  I can ""deactivate"" Jacosta, and use her ability to trigger my GG all in the same step.    On your opponents turn, it will get tricky, because they can use globals first...so definitely some net new risk out there.  Totally agree with you though...using Green Goliath just became a little dangerous, but there are ways around it, you've just got to plan ahead if you anticipate Jacosta being in your opponents team."
dicemasters,3d72co,calisk,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:44:29 2015 UTC,"yes like I said you spend resources to keep her ability down, so first trigger targets her negates damage and you take 1 damage trigger hulk, which will not kill her as minimum level has 4 def, so you spend another to remove her. you are now two resources down to remove her for one turn and again only one of her is removed, if their is 2 in play the first trigger of the ability causes you to take 3-4 damage and likely clears the board on the second trigger.  now what would happen next would go two ways, they will have something like mil puzzle out to remove your hulk, distraction to keep him on the board or what not, or you get in for your damage.  but let's say for arguments sake they stop hulk from getting in, and your hulk is now sitting on the board when it reaches their turn.   scenario one, they have a wasp they pay 2 after redploying their jacostas, dealing 1 to your dome and hulk triggers possible dealing 2-3 per jacosta in play for a total of 3+  burn,   or they force hulk to block assuming no preventative effects are on board dealing 8 or so to your face, so you will need to store resources for this moment as well, not to mention keeping up your ramp.  the concept is not that you can't get by jacosta's with the hulk in fact given enough resources it would be quite easy, it's the fact that as the hulk player you need to burn ALOT of resources each and every turn preventing the jacosta from taking advantage of the hulk.  you need to burn them on their turn to stop them from using hulk against you, you need to pay to keep hulk on board, you need pay to stop them from forcing hulk to block her, and all this time you need to keep masks up to keep your ramp going.  it would be very hard resource management to make hulk remain viable with them on board, it's an easy quick sand trap while they need to do nothing but pay the 1 resource to keep redeploying her each turn."

I went to the NECA website, but for any contact with them, they want a ton of details about what store you shopped at, what the store said about your complaint, where it's located, etc.   Finally, I found NECA's physical address on their website.

How do you miss an error present on more than two-dozen cards? How do you not notice misspelled subtitles on cards?   It ruins customer confidence. Is BAC Assemble supposed to cost 5, or did they screw that up? Is Hawkeye supposed to be a Mask character in this set, or was that a misprint? We only know once they print out errata.   Same thing with poor wording. How many people thought Spider-Man - Wall-Crawler was supposed to still deal combat damage based on the wording? How about the fact that the keyword Retaliation has two different meanings?   So maybe the rarity-stripe doesn't matter. It's still one more tick mark in the ""WK doesn't give a shit"" column of product quality."

Like a paper behind the card with your name. This shows them you own the card. They send you a fixed card. I don't mean all of the bad cards just the ones that change the game. They can print on demand the cards like fantasy flight does with some of their expansions.

dicemasters,3d4hvi,heroictactics,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:28:52 2015 UTC,"There's a few things to explain here:  All purchasing cost reductions have a minimum of 1 unless otherwise stated. Cards like Red Dragon include a reminder of this, but it still applies to other characters like Elf Wizard or Blue-Eyes White Dragon.  Buying an action is not part of Red Dragon's global. The effect of Red Dragon's global only procs on the condition that you buy an action die, but you do not have to buy an action die, even if you pay the bolt to activate the global.  Finally, when combining cost reduction effects, they are not applied in sequence. These effects persist until a purchase is made and they resolve or they end in the cleanup step at the end of the turn. When you purchase a die with multiple discounts, they are all active and no order can be applied to them. Accordingly, you cannot reduce the purchasing cost of a die below the highest minimum involved in the purchase. This usually only comes up with Half-Dragon - Paragon Humanoid and actions costing more than 3."
dicemasters,3d4hvi,Necromanticer,2,Mon Jul 13 13:45:45 2015 UTC,Can you activate the Red Dragon global without buying an action die?
dicemasters,3d4hvi,Necromanticer,2,Mon Jul 13 14:03:37 2015 UTC,"Yes you can. However, the damage portion of the effect is contingent upon the purchase, so it won't hurt your opponent unless you buy something. That said, it can be useful in order to proc an effect like the rare Doomcaliber Knight so that you can use your preferred global uninterrupted."
dicemasters,3d46ze,coraythan,3,Mon Jul 13 11:32:34 2015 UTC,"You don't need Gobby, Tsarina, or Hellblazer. I don't own any of them and win my fair amount of tournaments (losses are usually because of crap dice rolls). Just experiment with cards that you have and see what style suits you. If you wish to order singles (like for action cards) go for it, otherwise you don't need every starter."
dicemasters,3d46ze,Bahamut7,2,Mon Jul 13 19:51:30 2015 UTC,"Importance of those three in order?   Constantine - Cheap ""removal"" and control is always handy and he is a dynamic character, allowing you to respond to multiple threats within the same game. Not to mention, ""when fielded"" effect can mess up your day (Storm, ""Gobby"", Angel, etc.) ""Gobby"" - ""Gobby"" wins games. No joke, if your opponent doesn't bring the right counters, this little guy is going to wreck their face. Cheap cost, amazing stats, and an absolutely broken effect? This character single-handedly forced Wizkids to print more than 5 characters designed to shut him down almost exclusively. Tsarina - Heavy early aggression on a budget is nice and all, but she doesn't have the ability to completely shut down a game like the other two do. She can do great things with even more versatility than Wolverine, but she's no longer a one-card win condition. She's definitely an important card, but I rate the other two higher.   Whether or not to buy singles or feeds? That depends on what you have already. If you have a decent enough supply of meat and potato characters, then it's singles all the way. Singles are more economic in almost all respects, but far less fun to open and you have to go out looking specifically for what you want, you'll never be surprised by a character you had underestimated."

dicemasters,3d46ze,darkstar3333,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:08:15 2015 UTC,Honestly WZ just needed to errata the 1st generation Super Rares or restrict them out of general tournaments.  The entire set is awesome which led to the 2nd Marvel set being sort of meh.

dicemasters,3d46ze,vash989,3,Mon Jul 13 16:02:05 2015 UTC,"Looking at what you have bought, and what you have on order, you should have a decent sized collection.  When a new set comes out I usually buy a gravity feed and the starter.  I dont worry about pulling specific super rares, and with 8 of them in AoU I really wont worry about them.  Sometimes I pick up a few packs if I'm in the shop getting other merchandise.  I mostly play in booster draft tournaments, so I eventually fill out most of my dice and cards through them.    IMO right now, unless you plan on trying to compete in Wiz Kids official regional, national, and worlds tournaments, I would not worry about having gobby, tsarina, or hellblazer.  It depends on what the community is like where you play, in my area there is very little constructed, and those tournaments and game days that are, playing gobby and/or tsarina is usually frowned upon.  Everyone in my area is playing dicemasters for fun, and someone who shows up with a gobby/tsarina team to clean house is just no fun for anyone."

dicemasters,3d3anf,IvorySwings,3,Mon Jul 13 04:31:06 2015 UTC,"Couple of answers about a couple of AvX cards:  1.) When dice are rerolled, they retain their face unless otherwise specified. For the purposes of Storm's effect, if you roll a character face, that character returns to the field on whatever face your rolled it to.  2.) Smash! does indeed cancel Iron Man's damage. It doesn't come up often, but Smash! proccing means that the target character deals no more damage until the end of the turn. This includes effect damage in addition to combat damage, so as soon as Smash! targets Iron Man, his effect will no longer work."

Another level to consider.  Jimmy from the World's commentary put it perfectly. Dice Masters' mystery isn't about the present. You have all the information laid out in front of you.

It was a difficult decision, since I was familiar with Magic and enjoyed it, but I made it regardless, and am not overall disappointed so far. A decision to seek out clarification and advice on handling an aspect of the game I did not like/was not used to instead of just hating it and complaining about it was a less difficult choice, as I knew the first option would (and did, ty subreddit) yield better results as far as enjoying the game and getting more accustomed to the finer points day by day, so that they are less intimidating and I can have more fun in the long run."

dicemasters,3cyrpt,Skragz1469,2,Sun Jul 12 02:56:00 2015 UTC,"As stated, when Wizkids introduced the Transition Zone, they gave rare Pyro a big thumbs down. That self-contained feeding global became rather useless. This left almost no option to beef up his character ability outside of just buying a bunch of cheapies in the turn and/or to stop using PXG to let the pool build (which isn't really favorable). If your goal is to build with pyro as your primary win condition, then you are looking to setup for a fairly weak team, maybe fun, but weak. I'll give you my thoughts on it starting by going over my thoughts on your cards and then I'll give you my idea setup and some other cards to consider.  Red Tornado - Lab Creation : I see your idea and I get it. But for his ability to be effective, you need sidekicks going through your bag, if that many sidekicks are going through your bag, I can only assume you are not using PXG which is more valuable to the purchase of more bolt characters to fuel the fire. Most draws he just becomes a textless card or you are sacrificing ramp.  Cheetah - CA is good, cheap, and adds to a ping build that I would build down the post.  Constantine - CA : Sure he can help with fielding high end characters but he is also a shield, which blows. Even if you are running something like Ressurection, you are bound to get those shields on sidekicks because we all know you will roll the crap you don't need right?  Ghost Rider - Yeah he is cheap but that fielding cost.... Sure you wanna buy him for the cheap energy but you also want to be able to field in a pinch. I have a choice I would rather use than him. (Oh it's coming)  Now, established already that because of mechanics being changed, pyro is looking pretty weak. I would build a bolt team and throw him in for kicks and a ""swing away"" type guy. So what is the goal of my team? The thing that bolt characters do (probably) best... ping, -ping, Ping pong, whopPING. So, we start with PXG (not a whole lot of teams that don't love/need this) and Pyro- Uncontrolled. BEWD is cool but the setup im about to suggest is fairly cheap so BEWD isn't a big player here. Okay, so you wanna pull out Pyro and swing him every turn, which means he is gonna get fielded over and over again. That means Human Torch and Firestorm are key players here. Firestorm Jason and Ronnie - 2 damage to opponent when fielding a bolt character. Human Torch most people go to Johnny Storm (when any character is fielded ping 1 to opponent and a character), I prefer ""Flame on!"" (ping 1 to opponent when a character is fielded + global) More on my choice for that later.   On to the Pinging, Red Dragon (any i think) : That global is pretty fracking awesome. I can't say enough about it. Buy an action die for 2 less and deal a damage to your opponent? Yes please. Oh you are using ""Flame on!"" and paying an energy to boost that damage buy 1. Haha, suckers. This also leaves you open to run Power Bolt (which can use the Torch global to boost the damage buy 1). Don't go Magic missile unless you are running an adventurer, that global with your low defense will hurt you more than help. Oh, And red dragon can be a field wipe with that sweet breath weapon if someone is playing a beefy sidekicks setup.  I would then run Manticore - Paragon Beast (roll 2 bolt side on a dice and do 2 damage to a character or player) This is another field sitter and gets some extra damage in there. Also note it does not say during the roll and reroll step so when Pyro swings and rolls 2 bolts on a character dice, thats 4 damage to your opponents face. HOORAY! Vibe - Paco can also be thrown in to add 1 damage to your opponent and ALL characters. Has its ups and downs.  Then for the Ghost Rider replacement - Pit Fiend - Lesser Fiend: 4bolt to start, after one is fielded, for the rest of the turn, they cost 2 less to purchase. So, you buy 1 for 4 (or 3 with BEWD) and then buy the rest when he is fielded. Has a 1 field cost on all sides and the stats are decent.  So the rundown: PXG Pyro-Uncontrolled Human Torch - Johnny Storm or ""Flame On!"" Firestorm - Jason and Ronnie Red Dragon - Any Manticore - Paragon Beast Pit Fiend - Lesser Fiend  The last spot you can fill with BEWD, Vibe, Cheetah. Other special mentions include:  OP Drow Assasin - Can be moved to the used pile once per turn to deal 2 damage to a character. This adds 1 die to the roll for pyro.  Halfling Thief - Minion Harper - 2 sides of this die allow you to draw a die when the character is field. If the die is a sidekick, its goes to the used pile if not, roll it. Helps with the feed but we don't want to be wasting dice with things other than bolts.  Iceman - Too Cool for Words : Potential high damage attacker (especially if using Anger Issues (which is easier to buy with Red Dragon ( ;) ))) and the global helps with those crappy rolls when you get nothing but fists and shields (every other roll).  There is probably more I am missing but again, this is just the setup I would run. As far as Basic Actions, I would run Polymorph and Power Bolt. Polymorph to help keep the the standing fielded characters in and to remove threats like Green Goliath. And power bolt as a way to deal with Wasp when she becomes the new Meta next week (also a potential 8th slot for your team :D)  Hope this helps ya a bit. If you can brainstorm something else to help it, let me know, would like to hear your ideas."
dicemasters,3cyrpt,Skragz1469,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:57:01 2015 UTC,"Someone posted about Cyclops Field Leader under me but now I'm not seeing it. It is absolutely a viable card. It boosts the damage of your when fielded effects and the damage you could do with Paco and Manticore. I would use it as a fill in if there was something in my 7 I didn't have. If you wanted to run it instead of Manticore, that's okay too. I still prefer Manti because it is another way to get damage and may boost Pyros ability further which is what we want to try and emphasize for the OP's idea. This is under the assumption that the damage increase from FL would count only once per group of bolts rolled for pyro and not each individual one. I haven't invested any time into looking at this. You could run it as the 8th slot, but I would prefer a cheaper character like  Cheetah which hel ps both the fielded effects of torch/firestorm and will offer quick small shots that your opponent may easily ignore at a higher health, and will add up before you know it.  *edited some words, posting at work and keep bouncing between posting and the job."
dicemasters,3cyrpt,Skragz1469,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:33:54 2015 UTC,"Some cards to consider are: Manticore - Paragon Beast      This one has the added benefit of while it is active when you roll a double bolt it also deals damage to your opponent. Martian Manhunter - Green Martian      He's got overcrush built in, so he isn't someone your opponent will block lightly, making him more likely to go through, damage your opponent and end up in your used pile. Cheetah - Cursed Archaeologist      You already know why this one. Hawkman - World's Fiercest Attacker      Same as Cheetah. Not quite as good, but close. Punisher - McRook      He allows you to knock out an opposing character when fielded and provides you with more bolts when your opponent inevitably does something to get rid of him.  I'd assume your primary early focus is to purchase the characters who have bolts, so that your Pyro can do a lot of damage quickly. Red Tornado will help with this, as will having a good number of cheap bolt characters. Remember that as soon as you buy a character they do go to your used pile. But you won't pull off a quick victory with this team, you're going to need a few rounds to pull it off. You'll want something like Invulnerability, Horn of the Unicorn, Magic Missile or Enrage to up the damage that your characters that make it through do (like Martian Manhunter), especially since you'll likely want to roll for energy on some turns just to get those dice to the used pile instead of the field. Having any of the Phoenix dice available would be nice so you could leverage those bolts into forcing someone to attack, that way you can get rid of annoying blockers and when fielded effects.   Constantine can help with fielding costs, but that may not be your biggest concern with this type of strategy."

I'm not sure if it would be a +1 damage per damage from a bolt from pyro, or if it is just +1 on top of the total damage of all the bolts.   I'm still pretty new so not too sure if it's the first or second scenario. If it's the first, it would freak'n rock."

dicemasters,3cx3l5,Kaseron,4,Sat Jul 11 15:25:10 2015 UTC,Combat damage is the result of attacking or defending with a character.
dicemasters,3cx3l5,thetrevdor,2,Sat Jul 11 15:29:31 2015 UTC,Would the common Cheetah's 1 damage when attacking reduce Thanos' cost?
dicemasters,3cx3l5,WetFifty,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:21:42 2015 UTC,No. Combat damage is only damage dealt using an attacker or blocker's A stat. Hers is just a triggered ability.
dicemasters,3cx3l5,StormyWaters2021,-3,Sun Jul 12 17:22:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I can read the rules. That doesn't specify whether two characters who don't have overcrush deal combat damage to eachother or if its only damage done to the player."
dicemasters,3cx3l5,StormyWaters2021,5,Sat Jul 11 16:10:56 2015 UTC,"When you attack or block, your characters deal combat damage. An attacker deals combat damage to its blockers, and blockers deal combat damage to the characters they are blocking. If an attacker has Overcrush, any excess combat damage is applied to the opponent. If a character goes unblocked, it deals combat damage to your opponent.  So combat damage = damage dealt by attackers and blockers. Combat damage to your opponent = damage dealt by an unblocked attacker, or excess damage dealt through the Overcrush ability.  Edit: In regards to your comment, nothing in the rules indicates that damage dealt to a player is any different from damage dealt to characters. Nothing indicates that one is ""combat damage"" and the other isn't."

dicemasters,3cvi5z,BFast20,3,Sat Jul 11 03:03:00 2015 UTC,"I got home from work to find a box on the patio. It was my long awaited Daedalus box for dice masters. I received it a few days earlier than tracking said I should have which was nice. I got it inside opened it up and started to move my collection into its new home. The first thing I noticed is it was smaller than I had thought it would be. I have enough stuff to have two play sets so I knew I was going to have to leave stuff behind. So I put in max dies for all characters from Uncanny and AvX. Leaving behind all of my DC and D&D stuff for the Zen Bins when I receive them. However I have a tray and a half left empty for dice which I hope will be enough room for Age of ultron however there will not be enough room to fit Amazing Spider Man when it drops so this isn't much of a long term solution for a collector. However I could see me breaking up my collection and only bringing cards with me I ""May"" use in this case and leave the rest behind. As for construction it is really nice looking and was shipped safely and arrived in tact. I paid extra to have it pre-assembled. However right now it is sitting on my table not able to close I am not sure what it is catching on its almost like the dice are sitting too high up which isn't good. I am going to go mess with it some more now just wanted to get a quick review up.   TL;DR- The case is very nice, however not big enough to house a full collection if you have everything out. You would need to buy a second box or have a secondary solution. So my quest for a nice clean all in one solution continues. I would recommend the case to anyone looking for something to carry their small collection around or just their core playset not all of the extra characters you wont use."
dicemasters,3cvi5z,teh_longinator,2,Sat Jul 11 03:11:12 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat. At the moment I'm using bead-holders. 24 pockets, each hold 6 dice. Not too bad. Can usually fit a whole set into two of these.   The issue now is that I have so many multiples, and need some way to store them while trying to trade/sell... which we all know is next to impossible. Might just use a collector's box to house my traders, and keep these cases for my own personal collection.  That box looks hella cool, though...

There is a certain way to stack them. the best way i can describe it is this: the open end where you can't put any dice, alternate the way they are facing. I notice that when i stack the trays on top of one another, it juts out just a small bit. But when i alternate it it fits fine.   If that doesnt work just play around with those dice trays."

The only real difference being that I have Doc Doom - Victor and Magneto - Hellfire Club in place of Sinestro and Katana. Which is interesting since I started with that Katana too. I just found myself not using her at all. Having a villain in was worth more that her buff. Then Doctor Doom from AvX ,arguably, might be the best Villain bomb in the game.

dicemasters,3cvzq8,Bahamut7,2,Sat Jul 11 14:59:18 2015 UTC,"First thing I see wrong is that you're bringing Pick Your Battles instead of Villainous Pact on a villain team. This means you're losing out on a potential source of ramp and also bringing an action die that can benefit your opponent. With Villainous Pact, you're doing no such thing and making certain that you're going to have more blockers than your opponent. I cannot tell you how useful Villainous Pact's die is and it always hurts me to see so many people bring it strictly for its global. Seriously, it's basically Doctor Doom - Victor for a single turn allowing you to swing for lethal very easily. Also, you were complaining about Katana not being able to swing through? Not anymore. Now you can hit your opponent in the face with her 8+ damage much more reliably.  Personally, I don't rate the Joker/Harley combo. It takes too long to set up and only stops a single character. You'd almost always be better served building into your win condition and outracing your opponent. This is very subjective as having Harley and Joker fielded does provide a substantial boost to your Black Manta retalition, but I'd rather bring protection for my team than stop one of my opponent. You could also bring some sort of removal in this slot to handle your opponent's team. I'd recommend using these slots for Ring of Magnetism - Action Attraction and Hulk or Storm. You don't need to bring Lord of D. with the Ring, it works just fine on its own.  Sinistro is an... interesting choice. I'd rather see this slot taken up by BEWD or Mister Sinister when you get them, but for now it's okay. As a side note, you don't want to bring both BEWD and Mister Sinister. Their globals overlap and are built for knocking out your own characters, so there's no need for both of them. While it may be tempting to by Mister Sinister, it will almost always be better to use Deathstroke as your finisher, so it's best not to slow yourself down by trying for that higher retaliation damage.  Finally, Blue Beetle is always hit or miss in my experience. It's hard to keep on the field and only adds a bit of chip damage to your team. It may be better to use more removal for this slot instead of some incidental burn, but that's all up to you.    Just be warned, with the advent of the fantastic new Captain America's, burn teams are receiving a HEAVY nerf. If you want to make this team work, you're going to have to run either heavy removal or effect negation like Prismatic Spray."
dicemasters,3cvzq8,Bahamut7,2,Sat Jul 11 06:50:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply! I see you post a lot on here and really value you the input, especially since it's clear you read my wall o' text ;   Most of what you said does make sense to me (you may cringe to know I actually took OUT Pact for Battle at the last moment, will definitely give Pact a run though).  I get the mixed opinions on Harley/Joker, I definitely felt he boost it gave to my villain count, but also felt the issue of Joker coming out too late. If I can get BEWD, I'll certainly pair it with Grundy for removal, and could replace this combo. I may even get Grundy regardless, since as I mentioned half my opponents brought BEWD for me, lol. I will also consider Sinister as a potential placeholder for it as well, he can even knock out Grundy at level 1. Ty for the tip of not stacking BEWD and Sinister though.  Ring of Magnetism, I have tried it in a different set-up before to success, and might test it out here if I have more trouble with targeted actions/globals.   I know the new Captain America is built to help against burn, but I'm honestly not sure how many people will take advantage of him locally, but I will remember to get some solid removal in case."
dicemasters,3cvzq8,stevomuck,2,Sat Jul 11 07:08:53 2015 UTC,"Good team, I would reduce the Black manta Dice to 2 max, grab another Cheetah if you can (for the games that you can't ramp up), and definitely swap Pick your Battles for Villainous Pact. Katana will definitely become revelant. Harley+Joker is nice, but it does take time to setup and is only really useful if you are fielding joker multiple times. I would say throw in Green Goblin - Goblin Lord in her slot. This would give you a sidekick boost and a cheap but powerful die."

So, be forewarned. That said, I think making your games superhero only might be ostracizing other players that might reaaally like dragons or something. Dice Masters is not Magic. It doesn't have the devoted, widespread fan base. You should (IMO) be doing everything you can to get as many people as you can interested. DM is still young and needs fostering.  Furthermore, if you're concerned about paying to win with things like Gobby and Tsarina, you're removing a wide range of cards to help combat them and balance the meta (like human paladin). Human paladin lesser enclave is $0.25 online, versus Gobby's $60. How is that easier on the pocketbook by banning it? I dont think you can have your cake and eat it, too.  At my FLGS, we alternate event styles depending on the week. Casual events with things restricted (like doubles, commons only, no super rares, affiliated teams only, everyone has to use an OP card, etc) and then OP events that are straight legit unlimited. I really like both. I think you need both to make DM succeed."
dicemasters,3csz30,GreatDaneMMA,6,Fri Jul 10 16:34:29 2015 UTC,"I think house ruling things is bad for the game and for getting new players. That is one of the better parts of magic is no matter where you are you can come play at FNM and expect to see the same stuff. I think set limited events are fun so since ultron is coming out doing an ultron only OP event for those OP kits seems fine. If you are looking to get use out of bad cards draft is also a good bet because you end up playing cards you never would in constructed.   TLDR: House rules bad, full mixed, set constructed, and draft good."
dicemasters,3csz30,npcdel,3,Fri Jul 10 16:13:07 2015 UTC,"Correct. If Seattle chess players decided that Rooks are too powerful and banned castling, that would be really dumb and bad, and the Portland chess community would rightly look at them like ""wtf, guys?!"".   ""Gentlemen's Agreements"" soft-banning certain things are just bad for growing the community. If you're playing in a public place (like a FLGS) and you're not playing a specific limited format (like Rainbow Draft or 'new-set-limited'), you need to be in an Unlimited environment. TO's (tournament organizers) need to make it clear that just because a subset of players at a particular location don't like something, that's no reason to soft- or hard-ban a card or strategy.  TL;DR: Players should have a reasonable expectation that the cards and dice they spent money to acquire and play will be allowed at tournaments where those dice are legal (not banned/rotated out/in allowed sets)"
dicemasters,3csz30,StormyWaters2021,3,Fri Jul 10 16:52:19 2015 UTC,"The issue is that if you ever want to go elsewhere and play, you've set yourself up for failure. You decide to go to a tournament elsewhere and find that while your team did great in your local group, the wider meta doesn't have those restrictions so your team can't hold its own.   Far better to play everything open and just be a better player so you can beat the SRs that are giving you problems."
dicemasters,3csz30,WalterSkinnerFBI,3,Fri Jul 10 17:25:42 2015 UTC,"“I spent more money than you, therefore I win.”    In MTG we're talking about decks that could cost hundreds. I don't think it's a valid problem in this game.  I agree with /u/GreatDaneMMA - House ruling only creates confusion and division. If you're that concerned about these sorts of things, play limited, which is a higher level of play anyway.   You can also play constructed just within an individual set - that's valid and can be fun. We do that just to change things up.  If I'm traveling and see that there's a local game, I am not inclined to go and play if I see ""no PXG"" or ""only one super rare"" or whatever else. So local metas mix less and people just don't bother playing outside of their little sphere. That lowers attendance at large scale events. I think that if we're smart, as a community we band together and actively promote NOT doing these things, a standardized approach to the game.  It's damaging to the game. Ask yourself why WotC doesn't allow that with Magic."
dicemasters,3csz30,Skragz1469,2,Sat Jul 11 02:54:44 2015 UTC,"I think it is a terrible idea. I understand you're want for it and we considered it in our shop at one point because one guy pulled Gobby and we were like ""OMG so cool yet unfair."" Why did we choose against it? We call it a little some called ""BRAINPOWA"" or Brainpower for those who want to be all proper. Anyways....  I was against changing the rules because I would have to deal with people like this if I was going to travel and play the bigger events (which I haven't yet because of new baby and a lack of vacation time because of new baby). Now 3 of the people I play with did go to an event in Maryland a couple months back and it has really stepped up the game in our shop. And what happened to my playing? I got better. They showed me new ways to look at how people played and I adapted my strategy to be a competitor at every event I go to. It's not the overpowered Super Rares that ruin the game but the attitudes involved from everyone there. The people who can't invest and don't have the cards get discouraged because people who do boast about it too much (MTG what?). I have time in this and I see it's a game I'm gonna be sticking with. I have Gobby, had and sold Tsarina, and more of the ""good"" cards. But I don't use them. I haven't played a game with Gobby yet. Why? Because half of our shop is new people or those who can't invest like I can. I make it my goal every week to win by creating a team based on easily obtainable cards, and I do very well. I do this to show people that it's more about the strategy and creativeness.  2 Cost Halfling Thief, Limited wish, and Gearing up was the basis for my team this week, and I took first in an unlimited event at my LGS. I went against teams with Gobby, and Tsarina, and BEWD and I beat them because I thought about the Meta in our shop and made a team to stop it.  Here are some other things to consider... Are the people with cards completely driven every week to run the same ""OP"" team to win? Show people how to shut it down. Are you running Themed events on a monthly basis? Last week we did a 4th of July event where no non-basic card could cost under 4. Another one is Pauper, nothing but commons. I think we are also lined up to do the Two Hued Feud that someone had posted on here last week. It mixes it up for everyone and gets people to steer away from the overpowered cards a little. Can you trust people to lend out the cards? Try lending your Gobby's and Tsarina's to the new people who aren't going to jack your stuff and play against them, beat them, and show them its not the individual cards but the strategy behind the team.  Is limiting your card pool a good idea? On special occasions, absolutely. But to say that is completely it, I can understand the reasoning behind it, but I would not 100% support it."
dicemasters,3csz30,backupsidekick,3,Fri Jul 10 19:01:28 2015 UTC,"I don't personally think the super rares are the problem, there's only about 3 that get played regularly, and they do just fine on their own so a limit of 1 isn't a big deal.  Personally I'm just getting tired of seeing the same characters on every unlimited constructed tournament, and knowing that if I don't bring them I just won't win.  I don't think the cards are ban worthy, but it just feels like I have 129 unplayable characters from every set because I have to play specific characters if I want a worth while team.  I'd just like to see some more variety.  I think the game needs some super creative people to start introducing some awesome game types."
dicemasters,3csz30,TheGreatWar,5,Fri Jul 10 15:05:56 2015 UTC,Have you seen the lists from worlds? There was a decent amount of variation in team builds.
dicemasters,3csz30,backupsidekick,-1,Fri Jul 10 16:42:47 2015 UTC,"Not in the top 16.  There will always be people who play different cards, but not the people who win.  That's my only frustration, I have the option to play different characters for fun, but if I want to win, I know the 10-15 characters that I need to choose from."
dicemasters,3csz30,zeon20,2,Fri Jul 10 16:57:38 2015 UTC,In the top 16 for worlds there was 44 different characters being played. I think the pool is a bit bigger than 10-15 characters to win lol.
dicemasters,3csz30,thegreenlanternguy,3,Fri Jul 10 17:50:39 2015 UTC,"Dean who won was playing Grundy, Deadpool, and Storm Weather Witch. These were cards that were not common. Especially weren't deemed world championship material. David even had Manticore on his team and the ""wrong"" Doomcaliber Knight.  Yes, they had cards that were expected. Except the only reason FWX is a thing is because David and his run at Nationals. He didn't even bring GG to world's. There will always be a core of ""the best"" cards for any game. With how young DM is there is just going to seem like a small group for a while that we can't shake.  After AoU and WoL have been out a while, and we have new sets, I don't think we will be lacking variety."
dicemasters,3csz30,backupsidekick,-2,Fri Jul 10 17:37:44 2015 UTC,"So, let's look at worlds:  11 of the top 16 brought Constantine, 10 brought Black Widow, and 8 brought Jinzo.  That means in a standard 16 person tournament, half of the people will bring Constantine, Black Widow and Jinzo.  Hulk (in all forms) and Wolverine, both had nearly half of the teams playing them.  You can say that there were 44 different cards used, but if I have 7 common cards, and throw in a random 8th card, the basic formula of my team is still the 7 cards everyone uses.  The fact that over half of the 44 cards only appeared once on one team, 23 to be exact, shows that only 21 cards were used by at least 2 people.  I could throw common Vixen on a team, that doesn't mean she's playable or even that I will use her.  The other 7 cards will still be my team, with a one off for a specific purpose that may or may not ever come up.  Even with 44 cards, that's out of 650 cards, that's less than 10% of the cards actually seeing World's tournament play, only 3% of them seeing multiple teams using them.  Dean, who won, had 5 cards that were on at least 25% of the teams, over half his team.  Now, I'm not bashing Dice Masters, not saying anything negative other than only a handful of cards are seeing regular use, but World's show that 3% of the cards are being used regularly, 10% semi regularly, and 16 being on 3 or more teams... which leads me back to support my statement that 10-15 cards are being used VERY regularly.  With Magic you have a handful of cards, in Dice Masters, you have 8.  Having select cards stand out, really defines what the teams will look like when you can't have a bunch of ""what if"" characters.  You really have to have a defined game plan, no room for casual choices, when you have 8 characters to use.  I agree AoU and WoL have a chance to shake things up, so we'll see when that happens, but the post was about current sets and banning current cards.  TL;DR: you're right.  It's too long, you shouldn't read it.  Not much value here."
dicemasters,3csz30,zeon20,2,Fri Jul 10 18:19:14 2015 UTC,"I won't deny that some of the parts of a team overlap with each other like tsarina or constantine at worlds. I think though that is more reflective of how their local scene meta for them as a group looks like. I mean the 6 wolverines and 8 jinzos that appeared at worlds were run by guys who were either from dice anon or affiliated with them. There were definitely a lot of other builds that didn't get a chance to be streamed that had a viable shot at winning but just had bad rolls or a bad match up.  I also wouldn't dismiss 23 of the cards appearing only once on a team to be just a random card included on a common team. 3 teams had half their cards on their team appear only once in top 16 at worlds. N if u look at the those 3 teams specifically (trubies, melissa, michael), the only common element between these three teams was that trubie and michael shared constantine, kobold, and prisimatic spray. The rest of the cards on their team were unique to themselves to 1."
dicemasters,3csz30,WalterSkinnerFBI,2,Fri Jul 10 21:38:23 2015 UTC,"And further, for the teams at Nationals top 8, it was the unique cards that made those teams! I was the only one with Patch - huge part of my team. Walsh was the only one with FWX - HUGE part of his team. And so on.  Another thing that he doesn't consider is that with each card you choose, that eliminates at least two and as many as six other cards from your available selections. When Age of Ultron comes out, if I put Captain America on my team, I've just shrunk my available cards by 10, because I can't include another Captain. With any given slot on an otherwise complete team, there are around 18-21 fewer choices that you have based on your other choices.  And ANOTHER thing that isn't considered by just looking at a flat percentage is that in these games, some cards are included specifically for draft purposes - and others are common Vixen."

dicemasters,3cpr13,N_cubed,0,Thu Jul 9 22:36:58 2015 UTC,You're welcome. I would definitely recommend Michael vs. Norvic in round four and Shawn vs. David in round 8 or 16. Obviously the finals round too.
dicemasters,3cpr13,Ambrai,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:36:56 2015 UTC,"Hi, I'm fairly new to the game but have an ok grasp.  I'm confused though on something from the Michael vs Norvic matchup.  In game three on the turn time is called Norvic has bought a Wolverine and Michael has just Puzzled Norvic's Jinzo to the used pile.  There is some confusion for the players as to where Michael's action die goes but that isn't what my question is about.  How does Norvic move his Jinzo and Wolverine to his prep area by seemingly doing something with his two wild energy?  On his next turn he draws one die from his bag then returns his used pile to his bag, sans Wolverine and Jinzo because they are in prep, and draws three more and proceeds to roll six dice including the prep'd Wolverine and Jinzo.  Thanks for any help!"
dicemasters,3cpr13,zeon20,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:10:07 2015 UTC,"So in that situation they ruled that puzzle sends characters straight to the used even though there is an out of play zone for norvic. So since those two characters were the only ones in the used pile at the time, norvic was able to use resurrection to move those two characters into the bag n into his prep area."
dicemasters,3cpr13,Ambrai,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:07:44 2015 UTC,Sure BUT there was a die in Norvic's bag at the start of the next turn.  The first Resurrection activation should have drawn that.  Then the next would have pulled in Wolverine and Jinzo and he'd have drawn one of them.  Then next turn he'd have drawn the other character and then reshuffled his used pile and drawn three.  Functionally it ended up the same and rewatching it I think that was the momentary confusion that resulted when he DID draw that sidekick but it looks like Michael pointed out that it would have worked out the same.  I suppose the lesson is make sure you check your bag before moving stuff straight to prep in case it matters in your game.

dicemasters,3cqbhk,WalterSkinnerFBI,5,Thu Jul 9 23:20:05 2015 UTC,It's all but confirmed that Sue Storm and the Fantasticar were late cuts from Uncanny. As to why - Marvel/Disney is trying to beseige Fox to get access back. This is why you see very little X-Men and FF merchandising - Disney retains all those rights and is trying to starve them out. It's also why Spider Man is still ok - Disney and Sony have come to an agreement.  For more info - http://www.thereservepool.com/content/309-Don-t-Expect-the-Fantastic-Four-Anytime-Soon
dicemasters,3cqbhk,thegreenlanternguy,2,Fri Jul 10 00:24:31 2015 UTC,It is strange though that they would put the other 3 in with the affiliation and no Sue.
dicemasters,3cqbhk,WalterSkinnerFBI,3,Fri Jul 10 00:44:40 2015 UTC,"That was before the embargo. I guess they had planned to split them up, for whatever reason, and then Marvel put the kibosh on things as they have been lately."

dicemasters,3cqbhk,jhoratio,3,Fri Jul 10 00:58:14 2015 UTC,"And notice that there is only a single X-Man in the Age of Ultron, and that there will be none in Spider Man. AVX came before this nonsense, so that set was unaffected. Marvel probably would have understood that it would be unreasonable to ask WizKids to nix the entire Uncanny set, but was able to get them to cut Sue and the Fantasticar. And again, WizKids is not the only company to be asked to cut Fantastic Four assets from games.  Sony (who has rights to Spider, as opposed to Fox, who has X-Men and FF) and Marvel have an agreement now - hence the upcoming Spider Man set and the fact that you can buy Spider Man stuff at the Disney Store now.  You also have to understand how badly Fox embarrassed Marvel - they own the rights to the term ""mutant"" in reference to these heroes. That was decided in the courts. Marvel's not happy.  I guarantee 100% that this is the case."

That ruling is to easily let you (the player) know which characters are and are not adventurers. His adventurer status is an implicit part of his character and not contingent upon his card text, but rather the banner affiliation to one of the five adventurer guilds: Zhentarim, Emerald Enclave, Harpers, Order of the Gauntlet, and Lords Alliance.  Neither does Prismatic Spray remove affiliations. Affiliations are not card text. The one exception being Wonder Man who you already listed."

dicemasters,3cpini,Peas4Lunch,2,Thu Jul 9 19:06:12 2015 UTC,"Yes it is how the effect works. Just the same as Magneto's global can target villains in the field to reroll, so too can Zatanna target sidekicks in the field to reroll. This is one of Zatanna's severely underrated effects and using it well can catch your opponent off guard.  This specifically differs from Scarlet Witch - Controls Probability in that she specifies ""one additional time"" thus restricting it to dice that you've already rolled (usually dice that you drew and rolled regularly)."

dicemasters,3cp4ta,srbandrews,3,Thu Jul 9 17:21:45 2015 UTC,"All purchasing cost reductions have a minimum of 1. The text specifying so on the Red Dragon global is strictly a reminder of that rule. If a card does not specify a minimum of 1, it is still implicit.  The only time an ability can reduce the price to 0 is if it explicitly states that. Presently, the only card in the game that mitigates a purchasing cost to 0 is Half-Dragon - Paragon Humanoid. In the case that you had him instead, you could not stack a Red Dragon global on top of it to buy a 4-5 cost action for 0 since it would count the whole transaction.  However, even if you don't get the price reduction, you can use the Red Dragon global to deal damage so long as you still proceed to purchase an action die."
dicemasters,3cp4ta,Necromanticer,2,Thu Jul 9 17:58:16 2015 UTC,Thanks - I remember having read that rule now but had completely forgotten about it.
dicemasters,3cp4ta,Bahamut7,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:06:42 2015 UTC,Where was it ruled that the Half-Dragon and Red Dragon couldn't stack?
dicemasters,3cp4ta,Necromanticer,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:09:58 2015 UTC,"They can in fact stack, but when they do, they cannot reduce a purchasing cost below 1 as is the rule for thes type of effects. I don't believe it has been explicitly ruled, it just naturally follows from the text. Red Dragon's global cannot reduce purchasing cost below 1. The fact that Half-Dragon can and the order in which the abilities are used does not change that fact.  For instance, you have Half-Dragon fielded, you use the Red Dragon global to reduce the purchasing cost of the next action die your purchase by 2, to a minimum of 1. You then field a Blue Dragon and reduce the cost of the next action die you purchase by 3, down to a minimum of 0. That second reduction doesn't remove the strictures of the first. Both effects must be honored and the limiting factor here is Red Dragon's global which cannot be used to reduce the price of an action die below 1. Some people have made the mistake of applying the reductions in sequence, when you have to calculate them together. The abilities remain active until you complete their effect or until they end during the cleanup step.  For the same reason that you don't deal damage to your opponent until you actually purchase an action die, you also don't end the requirements of Red Dragon's global until you purchase your next action die, the relevant part being the minimum energy requirement of 1."
dicemasters,3cp4ta,Bahamut7,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:22:38 2015 UTC,"Fair point, I still would think the Half-Dragon could reduce it to 0 since it is one of the few cards that can reduce a purchase cost to 0."
dicemasters,3cp4ta,Necromanticer,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:39:01 2015 UTC,"I don't see how since the Red Dragon global explicitly cannot do that. When purchasing the action die, you're using both effect, not just one and they are not being applied one at a time. Instead, you have to use and follow the strictures of both at once, meaning that you are still bound by the minimum of both effects, and the higher one is the Red Dragon global's, so it's the relevant cost minimum."
dicemasters,3cp4ta,Bahamut7,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:39:17 2015 UTC,"Yea, I follow you, I'm just stating my opinion."
dicemasters,3cp4ta,Larac2,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:40:05 2015 UTC,"If the Dragon is 1st then it reduces from 2 to 1. Why can the Half Orc then not go from 1 to 0, as the card states?  The Active player chooses the order, or has this changed in another non rule book rule change?"
dicemasters,3cp4ta,Necromanticer,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:02:46 2015 UTC,"Because order has nothing to do with it. This is what I was referring to about people trying to apply the abilities in sequence. The way these conditional effects work is that they remain in effect until they resolve or they end in the cleanup phase just the same as any other effect. They quite explicitly do not target a card to reduce its price, but rather give you a discount off the printed price of whichever action you purchase next. Accordingly, they stay in effect until you purchase an action die and so you must fulfill all their requirements in order to use them. The requirements of Red Dragon's global are more strict than that of Half-Dragon, so you must go with the minimum of 1 energy rather than the minimum of 0.  It is not a matter of: you reduce the price by 2 (to a minimum of 1) and then reduce the price by 3 (to a minimum of 0). Instead you reduce the price of the next action die you purchase by 2 and 3 (to a minimum of 1). The minimum of 1 restriction that the Red Dragon global offers does not end until you purchase an action die or your turn ends, even if there is further price reduction.  As for your example, this is one of those instances where the active player wants to pay attention to the order of their turn. If they do use the Red Dragon global before fielding a dragon, they will be stuck paying the minimum of 1, even if the original purchasing cost of the action die was 3 or less."

It becomes a giant red obstruction.  On their turn, they take the cup off the mat and grab the die to roll.  Have them repeat this until it becomes second nature to reach for the prep area.  Classic conditioning."
dicemasters,3coda9,WetFifty,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:19:45 2015 UTC,"This happened to someone else I played against before in a tournament.  The ruling we played was you don't use it, you lose it (i.e., into the used pile).  This feels like the most fair solution to me, but in a casual game I'd just let them roll it late as long as they haven't spent any dice for their turn."
dicemasters,3coda9,forte27,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:03:25 2015 UTC,"This is what I was thinking. My friend suggests that we can use them next turn however if they are forgotten again then they are lost. However this takes advantage of someone ""forgetting"" so they intentionally get a larger roll."
dicemasters,3coda9,forte27,2,Thu Jul 9 14:18:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, I agree completely, and that's actually why we ruled it the way we did, because he had forgotten all the way until the beginning of his following turn.  If you let them roll it during their next turn, you're rewarding their breaking of the rules."
dicemasters,3coda9,thegreenlanternguy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:41:47 2015 UTC,"This actually came up in one of the World's matches that I watched. He has to roll them. Rolling your prep area dice is not an option, it is a requirement.  So if you want to play by the book, you have to let him roll them. I would personally house rule it. First time, no penalty. Second time, one die goes to the used pile. Third time, 2 dice go to the used pile and continue until he has learned his lesson. I would do this during casual play so he can learn there and doesn't end up pissing someone off during a tournament."
dicemasters,3coda9,thegreenlanternguy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:21:41 2015 UTC,So even if he has started buying he has to roll? Does he in effect gain a second roll and re roll or can he only roll them once?
dicemasters,3coda9,thegreenlanternguy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:25:15 2015 UTC,"I can't remember if he rerolled or not. This may be where Wizkids can make a ruling and punish this behavior while not letting the match take a big turn (because losing your prep dice could easily allow the win for the other player). Not letting you reroll forgotten dice would be a big deal and a huge incentive not to forget your prep.  Also, how do you forget your prep?!??!?! It's a pretty big deal."
dicemasters,3coda9,zeon20,3,Thu Jul 9 14:29:18 2015 UTC,Ask my friend! I have submitted it to their official rulings board but I am waiting for the post to get approved.   Maybe you could say if prep pool has more than 2 dice in it you must sacrifice some until you have 2 - then allow the player to continue. This would hurt but still allow you to use some of your prep.
dicemasters,3coda9,thegreenlanternguy,2,Thu Jul 9 14:35:33 2015 UTC,"That's not a bad idea. If you would be so kind, please post if they answer. I'd really like to know what they say."

dicemasters,3coda9,zeon20,3,Thu Jul 9 18:02:58 2015 UTC,Oh well for that game specifically I was the opponent to the guy that forgot and we just resolved it with me just letting him roll it. We didn't call judge and there wasn't any official ruling on that moment that we were following just to let you know.

dicemasters,3cmwzq,anossXVIII,2,Thu Jul 9 03:44:31 2015 UTC,"For what you are doing, this team is built well. You have your low cost attacker and blockers, your bag churner (gambit), your removal cards, and your end game. I can make a few suggestions.  -Johnny Storm would be great whenever you pick him up.  -Storm - Goddess of the Plains is by far better than Wind Rider as she could potentially clear your opponents entire field and she is one less to purchase.  -A basic action like Invulnerability or Anger Issues to give you a global to pump up Cyclops attack will make him 10x better as you can do this before the attack step.  -The last thing you need is a form of ramp that doesn't take away life. Since you are new I will list the known forms of ramp so you know what to shoot for.  1.) PXG - Professor X Global from the Uncanny set. Pay 1 mask for 2 sidekick dice in your used pile.  2.) Kobold Swarm - Cost 1 fist character from the D&D set. If one is active in the field, anytime you draw another kobold die it doesn't count against your draw 4 total.  3.) Red Tornado - Lab Creation DC Justice League set. While he is active, when you draw your 4 dice, if you draw 3 or more sidekick dice, you can put them in your used pile and draw 4 new dice. Yes, this can be combined with swarm.  4.) Silver Surfer, Resurrection, and Villainous Pact. You have silver surfer so you know how these work, but the other two don't cost you life.  Grab something else besides Silver Surfer, and you will be getting cyclops easily and quickly."
dicemasters,3cmwzq,Bahamut7,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:22:15 2015 UTC,I definitely agree with you on second look. I can get Professor X or Kobold Swarm easily. I think I'd get the Kobold Swarm over Prof. X because I suspect it'll be cheaper.  Should take Resurrection or Villainous Pact instead of Power Bolt/Distraction?
dicemasters,3cmwzq,Bahamut7,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:13:56 2015 UTC,"The kobold swarm is cheaper and your opponent can't use it while PXG you will share. Be warn, if your opponent plays adventurers, your kobolds will have to attack every turn the adventurer is on the field. Which will get them knocked out and your opponent XP.  DO NOT use Villainous Pact if you are not running primarily villains. It's action would decimate your team and leave you wide open. Resurrection is ok, but like PXG your opponent can use as well so keep that in mind."

dicemasters,3cmjsk,crazy_raconteur,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:14:53 2015 UTC,"Ty, and how do you draft basic actions?"
dicemasters,3cmjsk,WalterSkinnerFBI,2,Thu Jul 9 02:16:40 2015 UTC,"You don't. You get to choose the basic actions that you bring. In official draft rules, you can use any basic action from any set, though some choose to house rule this and limit it to the drafted set.  Also, there is a draft variant where you do three piles from four packs each. Haven't tried it but I'd like to."
dicemasters,3cmjsk,shinymuskrat,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:34:43 2015 UTC,then draft just like MTG   I don't know what this means. Can you explain further?
dicemasters,3cmjsk,thegreenlanternguy,2,Thu Jul 9 05:23:53 2015 UTC,"It pretty much ends there. Take a card, pass stack to left, receive pack from right, take card from that pack, rinse and repeat until all cards are gone. Then do the same with the other pack, but pass to the right."
dicemasters,3cmjsk,jkopplin,2,Thu Jul 9 05:50:03 2015 UTC,"This should help: http://dicemasters.com/rainbowdraft.pdf  I think the biggest thing missing from the explanation below is the dice. You open all your pack and make two piles of twelve cards that'll be passed around for the draft. But at the end of the draft you get a matching die from the pool for every card you drafted. So even if you get a rare version of a card you know you want, you'll still want to draft commons of that same type to make sure you have more dice to field on the rare.  The other interesting wrinkle is that all the dice are supposed to be sorted by color/character in the middle of the table. This gives you an idea of how many total dice/cards are available for each. Maybe you see a rare you want but there are only three dice in the whole draft for that character. Are you going to risk not getting those other cards? Or there may be ton of dice for another character so you might want to start gobbling up commons in hopes of finding that rare later."
dicemasters,3clnzg,d_gucci,2,Wed Jul 8 21:42:41 2015 UTC,"Flying Sidekicks also tends to be aggressive.  Aggro in the burn sense comes from cards like Gobby or Manta with retaliation.  Control is where cards like Jinzo and Constantine come in.   Midrange is doing stuff like unblockable Wolverine FWX - in the teams that he's appeared.  I think what I notice more than anything is that most things are midrange in scope, but that midrange is a scale rather than a single point - Midrange tending toward aggro or midrange tending toward control.   Combo would be more like the ""High Hopes"" stuff - using Patch/Ant Man to get lethal."
dicemasters,3clnzg,WalterSkinnerFBI,2,Wed Jul 8 22:24:50 2015 UTC,"Aggro in this game is anything that you can buy fast and field quickly followed by continually attacking with that character(s). Basically every turn you are doing damage.  Mid-range as Walter has said, is a broad category that covers most teams. You build up some defenses and go for a mid range cost win condition (purchase cost 4 - 6).  Combo would definitely be a team that requires a few pieces in place but when it happens, watch out! Combos can also refer to teams that have ways to use characters in more than one way thanks to a global typically.  Control is the easy one. This is where you force or manipulate your opponent into bad choices or cut off part of their team. Loki and Joker can prevent a character's die from ever being fielded and Jinzo can make actions and globals risky to use since you take damage every time you use it.   Another type of control is battlefield control. Best example would be Doctor Doom - Reed Richard's Rival and Venom - Angelo Fortunato on the field at the same time. All your opponents Non-Villain and Non-Fist characters are at a -3A/D which will typically KO a lot of characters as soon as they enter the field.  My team is primarily Combo with Control mixed in."
dicemasters,3clnzg,Bahamut7,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:58:34 2015 UTC,"so are unblockable namor, and kitty considered aggro characters?"
dicemasters,3clnzg,Bahamut7,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:09:04 2015 UTC,Kitty Pryde is definitely an aggro character. All of her cards (except the blank one) are designed to make her unblockable which is essentially free 2 - 3 damage every turn she enters the field.  Unblockable Namor falls into a mid game category (as you still need a few pieces together) but is also an aggro since he can go unblockable.
dicemasters,3cluie,Higgle_Wiggle,5,Wed Jul 8 22:31:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, they were fielded, but they proceed to be knocked out. All effect based upon that fielding do indeed proc."
dicemasters,3cluie,Necromanticer,2,Wed Jul 8 22:34:17 2015 UTC,"I look at it like this with Venom. He applies the -2/-2 to all non-fist characters in the field. So therefore they would have to be in the field at some point for his -2/-2 to take affect. Therefore, they would have been fielded for all intents and purposes on the card text."
dicemasters,3cluie,Neverethe,2,Wed Jul 8 23:36:57 2015 UTC,I won't reiterate what the others have said. They have you covered. I will just add to it.    This type of timing also happens for attacking and blocking. If a character is assigned to attack their ability happens when they are assigned to do so. Even if they don't end up following through (e.g. Distraction BAC global). Same for blockers. If a blocker is assigned to block their ability that triggers when blocking goes off when they are assigned.    I hope I helped and didn't insult with assuming you could use the information. I just remember starting off and having a roughish time nailing down all the timing rules.

And Ive never played competitive magic (way to expensive for my taste), but I do play magic casually and I've seen the competitive scene for it. I think they are comparable, yet different n certain aspects. Dicemasters the information on your opponents team is out in the open where as magic it is not. Certain cards benefit both players boards making selection of power cards not so easy to choose at times.  So there is a meta for dice masters, there is no side board, and there are archetypes. We just recently had a world championship tournament last month with a good showing of what the competitive scene looks like.   Here's an article covering the top 16 archetypes that appeared in worlds http://www.diceanon.com/dice-masters-worlds-top-16-teams-quick-team-analysis/  U can also check out the stream for the tournament here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjPLpCExt7PZ36OmsDuAsVC6j2IG5MYlK  The reservepool is a good place to start to look into strategies and resources for trade and news and stuff: http://www.thereservepool.com/content/  And currently we have vassal for online play but I dont know how to utilize it since i like the feel the dice in my hand lol"

dicemasters,3cg3xb,Necromanticer,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:59:53 2015 UTC,"I don't have any resources for the first half of your question, but I can definitely fill you in on the second half.  This game is very similar to Magic in the combat, but ability resolution is not quite the same. The active player uses as many abilities as he likes until he gives the inactive player a chance to use a single ability (rinse and repeat until the inactive player passes and then the active player passes), so timings are very easy to understand and there are no real chains. There is an exception for ""reactive"" abilities, but it's very straightforward.  The ""sideboard"" is built into the team. You play with 8 characters, 2 BAC's, and 20 dice, but you're probably not going to purchase and use all of them in a game. With that in mind, there is no way to swap out characters or dice between matches. Once a competition has begun, your team is set.  There are many archetypes with different levels of strictness. A Bolt-Burn team is a reasonably broad archtype, whereas dragon teams are very restrictive.  Dice Masters Data Base can be found in the sidebar and allows to to build and share teams. If you're looking for a forum to discuss and gain insight into teams, I'd highly recommend The Reserve Pool which has a pretty active set of forums, user generated blogs, and articles.  You can definitely playtest online using the Vassal Board Game Engine. I made a tutorial on how to use it a while ago, but it is predicated on you understanding how to play and as I said, I don't have a particularly good resource to teach you the basics in an audio/visual format."
dicemasters,3cg3xb,StormyWaters2021,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:32:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the speedy reply.  In regards to learning resources, im searching a bit more and ive found some stuff that may help me out more. Eventually i'll get it, just asked if anyone  had a quick on hand resource.  So in relation to the stack in Magic, does it work the same? As in, can i respond to every activation, are their instant speed timings? Since you said no real chains im guessing this means that i cant respond at all until my opponent explicitly passes priority.  So from my understanding is that depending on the game you can choose to purchase or not purchase certain characters depending on the matchup? Can/do teams have slots that are specifically for metagaming certain decks? And if so, im guessing they only purchase that character when its favorable for the matchup?  When in relation to the archetypes, is it like Yu Gi Oh in which theres a lot of ""tribal"" archetypes? Or different places on the spectrum of Control/Combo/Aggro? The site you linked me has at max almost 200 entries and not any real discussion going on. I guess also what im asking for is top results from events that can show top tier compositions.  Thank you a ton for a link to that, i will probably install that and eventually use it to test with other people and goldfish as well."
dicemasters,3cg3xb,GoGoNJDevil,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:45:14 2015 UTC,"There is not a stack in Dice Masters, and you do not get to respond to everything. They play as much as they want, resolving all of it, then pass priority to you. The only time you can ""respond"" as you would in Magic is when the ability you are using is designed to interrupt something: basically just preventing damage. You can't, for example, sacrifice a character in response to them targeting it.   Yes, you can have a character designed specifically to counter something. Since there is no sideboard, you have eight total slots to work with, so there is a lot of balancing to consider there. It's better to go for versatility and take answers that can cover a broad range of problems, rather than specific ""silver bullets"" like Magic.   There are some archetypes, but the game is still in its infancy so there is very little in terms of solid archetypes. You've got direct damage, retaliation, sidekicks, and decks that cheat big bruisers into play. As new sets come out, and more mechanics and options come to play, this will all change."
dicemasters,3cg3xb,Necromanticer,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:04:23 2015 UTC,"There are no ""sorceries or instants"" in DM so reacting like you would in Magic is not necessary.  I don't want to say it's more dumbed down (because it definitely isn't) but it's more streamlined, per se?  There are 2 times during a turn when both players can play effects simultaneously...and I believe...and correct me if i'm wrong please...but the person whose turn it is currently would decide the order in which events occur that happen simultaneously.  There are the same kind of archetypes as with Magic, i.e., Aggro, Control and Combo.  Combos are a MILLION times easier to pull off as you control what dice you have and can thereby control your combos.  Since the game is fairly new, most of the top players play the same cards.  You'll more than likely see Constantine - Hellblazer, Black Widow - Tsarina, Green Goblin - Gobby and a Professor X (either Trainer or Recruiting Young Mutants) on most teams.  If you're looking for videos of events, Wizkids has the National Championships up on youtube and the Worlds will hopefully be posted soon.  Another thing to bear in mind is that there are not nearly the amount of cards available as in Magic.  There are less than 1000 cards TOTAL at this point and some are WAAAAAAAAAAAAY more powerful than others since the game is so new.  (Like Black Lotus and Moxes, there are cards that will eventually be restricted and/or nerfed in some way)."

Since you said no real chains im guessing this means that i cant respond at all until my opponent explicitly passes priority.   Yeah, you're not allowed to respond until your opponent gives you a chance. There's no stack, everything activates and then resolves before you move on to a new action. There are a few exceptions like abilities that can only be activated in response to other effects such as the Human Paladin global, but otherwise the active player gets a lot of control as to how the turn plays out.   So from my understanding is that depending on the game you can choose to purchase or not purchase certain characters depending on the matchup? Can/do teams have slots that are specifically for metagaming certain decks? And if so, im guessing they only purchase that character when its favorable for the matchup?   Yes, yes, and yes. Since you have 8 slots and 20 dice, there's a fair bit of room to fit in a win condition, ramp, removal, support, and all the familiar concepts from Magic. If you're particularly worried about a certain strategy such as overcrush (Dice Master's version of Trample), you can include a card that handles overcrushing characters like Zombie - Greater Undead.   When in relation to the archetypes, is it like Yu Gi Oh in which theres a lot of ""tribal"" archetypes? Or different places on the spectrum of Control/Combo/Aggro?

You very much can play with a tribal team, but it's not as necessary as it is in Yu-Gi-Oh. Sorry about DMDB, I didn't understand what you were requesting. The Reserve Pool or Dice Anon will probably be your best bets for top-tier meta knowledge and information, but Dice Masters isn't quite as ""solved"" as the more established card games. There's still a lot of diversity and discussion about the strongest strategies.  Good luck with digging into the game. Dice Masters has a pretty active and welcoming community, so you shouldn't have a problem finding people to help you if you're ever wondering about something."
dicemasters,3cg3xb,WalterSkinnerFBI,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:09:57 2015 UTC,"Another posted summed up what I was going to say.  I will add mana curve in team building like in MTG is something to consider, balancing enough low cost characters with some higher cost ones, making the team synergism well together, and all around balance.    ATM there are two cards from the first set that are like Jace the Mind Sculptor that can win you the game by themselves.  They are Black Widow - Tsarina and Green Goblin - Gobby.  These still see alot of play in the competitive scene with good reason.  However, as more and more sets get released their relative power keeps decreasing.  One main difference from MTG that took some getting used to, is how Global abilities work (Globals are abilities on cards, both actions and characters that can be activated by either player who can pay the mana (energy) cost to activate them).  There are no instant ""gotcha"" effects in dice masters, and very few reactive globals that can be played out of sequence.  There are only two times globals can be activated, during the main phase, and during the attack step, after blockers are declared.  If you are the active player (it is your turn) you can use global abilities, field characters, purchase dice, use actions, etc all you want.  Before moving to the attack step, you must pass priority to the inactive player and allow them to use any global abilities they desire.  Then priority gets passed back to the active player, and they can continue to do any of their normal main step actions.  When both the inactive player, and active player pass, the main step ends.  Now, the important thing that most new players miss is if the active player does not declare an attack, then the attack step DOES NOT HAPPEN and you move right to clean up and there is no additional option for the inactive player to use global abilities."

dicemasters,3cdvbm,Benny6Toes,2,Tue Jul 7 10:50:04 2015 UTC,One note: there is a specific order in which global actions may be taken by the players. You may want to outline that on your cards.

dicemasters,3cdvbm,Quazal,3,Tue Jul 7 05:41:54 2015 UTC,"If multiple global are played, the active player's globals resolve first, in whichever order they determine.

dicemasters,3cd4zg,anossXVIII,3,Mon Jul 6 23:57:35 2015 UTC,"Buy Feed, sell/trade extras for singles."
dicemasters,3cd4zg,darkstar3333,2,Tue Jul 7 01:31:03 2015 UTC,"my thoughts exactly. A friend and I split an uncanny feed, now I have a really good base of cards. It is definitely more economical now to buy/trade for singles. If I were to buy another feed, I would probably get a lot of the commons I already own."
dicemasters,3cd4zg,d_gucci,2,Tue Jul 7 02:39:40 2015 UTC,I believe in a compromise. Buy 20 or 30 boosters (you may get one of those rares or super rares) and than buy whatever you need in singles. You should get extra dice you need with this process and cards you may not use right away but rediscover later.
dicemasters,3cd4zg,Bahamut7,2,Tue Jul 7 00:24:49 2015 UTC,"My strategy for each set so far has been to buy the starter kit, then buy two boxes of gravity feed.  Typically, I end up missing about 4 or 5 rares, with 6-8 duplicate other rares I can use to trade for them (have been trading through tradecardsonline.com, before I realized this subreddit existed).  I also usually get 3 of the 4 super rares, and then I just get the last one on eBay.  That puts my total cost of each set at roughly $165 plus a few stamps.  (Estimated at 65x2 for the gravity feeds, 15 for the starter, and 20 for the missing SR).  I'd imagine that's the cheaper route to go if you want complete sets.  I haven't actually done the math on buying every single rare though.  Even if it's a few extra dollars, I like opening the packs.  The only downside is the huge stack of extra common/uncommons I have.  Coolstuffinc.com doesn't buy most of them, so they're just sitting here collecting dust."
dicemasters,3cd4zg,fist_is_also_a_verb,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:24:27 2015 UTC,"I give those out to newer players, and/or trade out the nose if they have stuff I want.    More players in the game, means I can play the game more"
dicemasters,3cd4zg,NoxTempus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:37:54 2015 UTC,"Depends on your economics.  You can:  A) Purchase a gravity feed, which will get you most but not all cards in the set. You will also have extras which you can sell or trade online or with your local gaming group. I prefer this method (at least as far as I remember from buying Heroclix bricks, have not as of yet bought a feed but I will), as I do like to have trade stock, and sometimes you can get better deals trading face-to-face.  B) Purchase the sets outright online. I've seen lots on eBay for complete CURS sets, though they are usually more expensive than buying feeds, especially with Super Rares. You get everything you want now instead of with time and trading/selling, but you pay a bit more for the privilege.  Edit: If you're not buying complete sets and just individual singles to complete a set, you will end up paying less than buying and praying for the cards you need. If your dilemma is either buying more boosters to try to finish a set or just buying the missing card singles outright, I'd go with the singles."
dicemasters,3cd4zg,JakeSalvage,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:03:20 2015 UTC,"I really enjoy the excitement of buying boosters.  That being said, at a certain point I start getting more doubles than new cards and I switch over to cherry-picking the singles that I want.  Best of both worlds in my opinion."
dicemasters,3cd4zg,banjovial1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:31:20 2015 UTC,"The other day I bought about 50+ packs of D&D.  Why? Because I didn't have the Uncommon Orc.  I ended up getting him and a couple other cards I needed, but nothing worth the $40 I spent.  The value came from the smile my wife gave me when I showered her with my extra dice and cards.  She likes the game too, so as long as you have some use for the random extras, I would go with boosters for fun, but if you actually care about the economics, of course you should just buy singles.  The biggest problem always comes around when a card becomes a hot commodity and you have to pay full price instead of the original spec cost of the boosters.  (I'm looking at you, Blue-Eyes.)  I got mine in a trade back when he was a $10 rare.  Now, I'd have to shell out $55 on ebay for him."

I needed a TON of cards from there having only bought about a dozen packs prior and ended up getting lucky and pulling BEWD rare in the Feed.  I figured worst case I'd at least have stuff to trade for him.  But I had a hard time paying $55 for a CARD when I could get a feed for $60 with a chance at getting said card.  Oh...and opening packs is much more fun!  (That being said, I've only bought singles of D&D because I have no interest in the set)"
dicemasters,3cd4zg,GoGoNJDevil,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:12:26 2015 UTC,"I buy a feed or 2 (I only collect Marvel), maybe a handful of boosters with change over the course of a release, then trade/buy the rest to fill out my collection.    If you want the entire set, with 4 of each dice, cheapest way is to get at least 1 GF, IMO."
dicemasters,3cd4zg,NoxTempus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:35:17 2015 UTC,"Others have already pointed out the important stuff, how in any collection based game, buying exactly what you need will always be cheaper than hoping you get it randomly in a pack.  Dice Masters further complicates the matter since you only need a single card of the most valuable version of a character to get the most out of it. If I were running a full set of 4 of some top-tier Magic cards, I'd need to shell upwards of $30+ a piece to get everything I needed. With DM, you only need a single card of the really expensive one, then you can fill out the playset buy buying 3 (or however many you need) super cheap commons to fill out the dice you'd need with it."
dicemasters,3cd4zg,TheRealQwade,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:52:37 2015 UTC,"There is no debate. In no way is it ever +EV to buy boosters. Singles are always, always more economical. If it ever wasn't, people would buy packs until prices rose to create parity."
dicemasters,3cd4zg,npcdel,2,Tue Jul 7 00:06:42 2015 UTC,I believe you meant to say that people would buy packs until prices fell to create parity? I don't forsee WizKids raising the prices of their boosters if they're outselling the singles.
dicemasters,3cd4zg,Necromanticer,0,Tue Jul 7 00:34:40 2015 UTC,"Technically I was accurate but unclear. I was saying, if it was ever a better EV to open packs rather than buy singles, people would buy packs until pack prices rose enough to make it not a better value.  Not wizkids but retailers. To use a recent example, Modern Masters 2015 was selling at $13/pack at a FLGS shortly after release, despite MSRPing at $9.99.    The perceived (and at the time actual) EV/pack dictated that price, because the store could open packs themselves and make more money selling the singles. You can see this on the after-market with virtually any item with randomized contents where the price increases based on the value contained therein."
dicemasters,3ccrqx,Spiral0Architect,2,Mon Jul 6 22:15:11 2015 UTC,"The official ruling is that ?'s do not count as individual energy types. They can be used to pay for whichever energy you like, but they are still ? faces.  This is a very important distinction in the War of Light DC set that's coming out soon enough, so WizKids has made the matter explicitly clear."

dicemasters,3ccrqx,Necromanticer,3,Mon Jul 6 23:56:26 2015 UTC,"Incorrect. ?'s can be used to pay for any energy type, that's what they are for. However, they do not qualify as a face showing every energy type at once. This is important for a few effects such as Pyro - Pyrokinetic and some of the upcoming cards from the War of Light set.  You can use a ? as whatever energy you desire, but it is still a ? face, not a ""whatever energy you want to count it as"" face."

dicemasters,3ccrqx,Necromanticer,2,Mon Jul 6 23:10:42 2015 UTC,"You're assuming that you draw sidekicks. If you've built a bolt team and keep track of what's in your bag, you can use this global when you have 2 characters left in the bag. If you use it then, you have a 50% chance of rolling an energy face on either die and a 66.6% chance to roll double energy.  Is this incredibly useful? No.  Is this a ""crap global""? No, again. It just requires a build and circumstance to become useful."
dicemasters,3ccrqx,Tolk63,3,Mon Jul 6 23:21:25 2015 UTC,"Exactly.    Any card in your deck should be placed there with a strategic reason behind it, with other cards that synergize with it to better your odds of getting it to perform what you want."

dicemasters,3ccrqx,lolol42,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:30:09 2015 UTC,"So you're saying you are using the global multiple times in one turn? In order to get '8 energy', you used his global 3 or 4 times in one turn? I haven't done the math, but I'm assuming there is less than a 5% chance of rolling a character die to double bolts 3 times."
dicemasters,3ccrqx,lolol42,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:09:13 2015 UTC,Yes I'm just chaining the global over and over. If you saturate your bag with Bolt characters you will be able to slowly ramp up. It's a bit of a gamble but it's just a silly deck I have for fun.

If an effect triggers, you must resolve it before you trigger another effect. However, if multiple effects trigger at once, the active player gets to choose the order in which they resolve.  In this case, the rolling of a double bolt face has triggered' Vibe's effect. Immediately, the damage from that effect is dealt and resolved, leading to your sidekicks being knocked out. There is no moment in which you can activate Icaman's global before Vibe's effect procs and resolves."

It's not a 100% you win card, but there's so many powerful and useful moments that keeping a single character from blocking can prove invaluable."
dicemasters,3cbgsh,forte27,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:16:06 2015 UTC,"Adding to this, relentless is an effect that benefits from other cards supporting it.  You might want to be able to fill your field with a bunch of dice so your opponent won't be able to use it as effectively.  If your team doesn't do that, then it could harm you more than help.  It also synergizes well with Professor X's global ability.  I'm always running a mask heavy team when I use Relentless/Professor X, so I usually have masks to work with.  I'm also fond of using Transfer Power at the same time.  If you can save up some shields at the end of your turn, you can mitigate the damage your opponent can do if they use Relentless."
dicemasters,3cb6vq,Vandelay_Latex_Sales,2,Mon Jul 6 15:26:37 2015 UTC,"Namor - Atlantean if you can get him to block, Breaker the Magical Warrior - Mana Break when he's fielded, either non-rare Jinzo when they're fielded, and Constantine - Antihero can force it to be rerolled like Magneto's global can reroll villain dice.  That's 5 cards, 4 of which were in the first sets, that can all take care of it. These also work against Millenium Rod, Millenium Puzzle, Vibranium shield, or any other action die that goes to the field."
dicemasters,3cb6vq,Necromanticer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:44:51 2015 UTC,Thanks. Interesting that only one counter appears in the same set as Cerebro and even then you have to block with him to make it happen.

dicemasters,3c9kyi,rgxbatman,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:06:33 2015 UTC,"If you want to play control, go with a Villain/Burn team. Key components will include:   Green Goblin - ""Gobby"" Cheetah - Cursed Archaeologist Black Manta - Deep Sea Deviant Mister Sinister - Nasty Boy   Your goal is to burn down your opponent's life with these characters. Green Goblin is obvious with his incredible damage whenever fielded. However, you want to field him more than once, so you can use Mister Sinister's global to knock him out and then filed him again. If you have Black Manta or Mister Sinister on the field, this is going to also deal direct damage. Finally, Cheetah provides great persistent damage, chunking your opponent little by little for as long as she can.  The remaining 4 slots are a lot more flexible. Mystique - Raven Darkholme could get powerful as you get more characters fielded. Doctor Doom - Victor could act as a finisher by blasting away your opponent's field. The Joker - Red Hood will be DEVASTATING in this format. Solomon Grundy - Buried on a Sunday could do well as a form of removal. Sinistro acts as a decent buff character. Magneto - Hellfire Club is guaranteed to burn your opponent down faster if they're not running villains. And finally, Juggernaut - Kuurth makes for a powerful beatstick for relatively cheap.  Your options for removal are fairly limited, so I'd grab Crush Card Virus for a BAC and Villainous Pact as my other for clear game ending potential on top of incidental ramp. If you do grab The Joker, Magic Missile is imperative and will allow you to wreck your opponent's field, especially if they're running weenie Avengers."

Sadly, BEWD is not a villain, even if Kaiba was. That's why I suggested Mister Sinister and Card Crush Virus.

I know he's not a villain but hes cheap and there arent many cheap marvel lightning bolt characters)  Sometimes I put Cerebro in there depending on the other team but this is the core of what I use.

dicemasters,3c6ycg,BigWurm,3,Sun Jul 5 19:14:02 2015 UTC,"If rare Grundy is knocked out any way other than combat damage you knock out one of your opponent's characters. So, you can use the Blue Eyes global to knock him out yourself for spot removal. During your own turn you also get the character purchase discount. During your opponent's turn, no discount, but you can prevent an attack from something nasty and potentially just re-field Grundy during your turn.   The only real drawback is Grundy can be a little expensive to keep fielding over and over."
dicemasters,3c6ycg,d_gucci,2,Sun Jul 5 21:19:57 2015 UTC,"Pretty simple, once grundy is fielded you kill him with bewd, so as grundy is ko'd not in the attack step you get to kill an opposing character and also the next die you buy cost you 2 less energy."

dicemasters,3c6igz,IvorySwings,4,Sun Jul 5 15:43:15 2015 UTC,Meta in this context is no different from meta in any context. It's about the game around the game.

dicemasters,3c6igz,StormyWaters2021,2,Sun Jul 5 16:19:39 2015 UTC,"Peas,  I can only give you what I've done to become a better player. (At least I hope I am decent enough, I win more than lose in my little gaming area, anyway). I started playing DM from the very beginning, and was pretty clueless about what did what, and when to do it... just like how you put it in the original post here.  I knew I wanted to get better, so I started following the various podcasts and reading the blogs that are out there for us from people that play.  I realized early that I didn't get a chance to play enough to learn rapidly, so I found places like Dice-Anon and the Reserve Pool indispensable.   Getting a chance to play a lot over the next few months helped a ton as well.  You just can't beat getting to play and see what you've learned start to take effect.  We all want to win, certainly, but don't get frustrated in a loss, try to figure out how to come at it better the next time.  I've also found Dicemasters Vassal to be an excellent way to test teams out and work around particular strengths and weaknesses.  As a former, heavy, MtG player/collector, I think Dicemasters ranks right up there.. it's my favorite game by far. But it's complicated, and you can't just hop in and expect to shine.  Like anything else, you'll need to train to get better... not sure if there's an easier way to say it.  Also, and near everyone around will have done this to an extent... find a good deck from... anywhere you can, copy it, play it. In Dicemasters, imitation is the best form of flattery there is.  From that point on, make subtle changes to the deck to make it your own. Ideas for new decks will start banging around in your brain in no time.  But.. as dond72 pointed out at the end, you have to have fun, win or lose. ""Not in the victory, but in the contest...."""
dicemasters,3c6igz,Tolk63,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:44:03 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. I normally do take a loss as a learning experience (I still play MTG) but after playing about 4 games in a row and losing all of them it quickly becomes infuriating.  I guess I need to just play more but no one likes to lose 4-7 times in a row.
dicemasters,3c6igz,d_gucci,2,Mon Jul 6 18:48:55 2015 UTC,"What kind of ramp are you using? PXG allows you to ramp to 6 fairly quickly.   my ideal play to ramp to 6 cost is as follows: - T1 1x 2 cost, 2 PXG = 7 dice to roll next turn. - T2 1X 4 cost, 3 PXG = 10 dice to roll next turn (all of your dice). - T3 1x 6 cost, and maybe field 2 cost or 4 cost.   I'm not saying this will work against your local meta, since this type of early ramp to 6 would get owned pretty hard vs aggro since you are not putting anything on the board till turn 3 and were only able to buy 3 characters.   On T2 since you are rolling 7 dice, you could buy the 6 cost, but would only leave you with 1 PXG and would screw up your ramp for the rest of the game."

dicemasters,3c6igz,ElPrezAU,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:28:25 2015 UTC,"Other examples of ramp are cheap dice that you can buy early to roll doubles of your main energy type, like Morphing Jar - Canpoic Jar for masks (which PXG uses) or Kobold - Greater Humanoid, which can help speed through your bag too if you have at least one fielded (See: Churning)  The good thing about PXG is that early on if you don't own one, you can use the one your opponent most likely has.

dicemasters,3c1wy7,thetrevdor,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:15:19 2015 UTC,Being competitive with your friend will always be possible; just as long as you have your win condition and scale your purchase costs. Just remember that he will have access to more mechanics in the game then you would. It shouldn't be to the point where it is 100% one sided. There are many team archtypes you do have access to with only marvel.
dicemasters,3c1wy7,dicemasters101,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:45:00 2015 UTC,"I would think it would be possible with just Marvel, especially after the next two sets come out. With the other sets in your collection it's true you will have more cards to pick from, but you can build a good team to do what you want with what you have. Just like dicemaster101 said, just make sure you know your win condition and work around that.   Basically it's all about what you like and appeals to you. I'm into marvel, and soon DC but I doubt that I will go for D&D and yugio because I couldn't give a rats ass about them, and I don't know anything about them."
dicemasters,3c1wy7,Stasiak1,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:00:12 2015 UTC,"The AvX set is probably the most powerful overall so far and UXM/AoU both have a lot of good stuff in them. If you ever wanted to expand beyond Marvel, most of the good cards from other sets can be had for a lot cheaper than chasing them through packs. If you're just playing with one buddy though, you can both just agree on only using Marvel if you wanted."
dicemasters,3c1wy7,Vandelay_Latex_Sales,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:20:39 2015 UTC,"When we started I bought uncanny just on a whim, and we both really enjoyed it. My friend went back the next day and bought avx, we played that night and I was getting my ass kicked by beast and storm. He played all low cost cards, i thought there was nothing I could do. It was just imba. The uncanny starter just doesn't equip you with the proper low cost cards to deal with the two costs beast, storm, and flame dude-man.   After doing some soul searching I realized that I couldn't beat him playing his aggro style,  and I needed him to play my game.  so I came up with a kitty purry unblocked team using the enrage global, and got my first win."

dicemasters,3c1l20,thetrevdor,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:37:28 2015 UTC,"In that case, if the Green Arrow (Emerald Archer) is fielded against characters from other sets, would nothing happen since they aren't villains?"

It's almost certain that every Marvel/DC set will have Villains, and we may see them in other sets as well.   As stated by /u/thetrevdor there are certain words like ""Adventurer"" which you likely won't see in other sets, so those specific cards may be less useful, but the vast majority of cards work perfectly well across sets.   My current team uses cards from four different sets, in fact."

dicemasters,3c0iwg,skajohnny,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:40:18 2015 UTC,"You really don't need Tsarina to be competitive anymore. She's really expensive, and while good, is slowly but surely being replaced with other characters."

dicemasters,3c0iwg,thetrevdor,2,Fri Jul 3 19:58:49 2015 UTC,"The Common Cheetah is one such example. She might not do the same damage as Tsarina, but she's a very reliable way to cut into your opponent's health. Other characters, like DC's Constantine, have proven quite useful in shutting Tsarina down.  It isn't that Tsarina isn't still a good card--she is--it's just that most strategies don't really involve her to win nowadays. Pair Cheetah with Black Manta's retribution, for example, and you have a character that can do 2 damage to your opponent without giving them the option to spin one of their characters down."
dicemasters,3c0iwg,thegreenlanternguy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:02:35 2015 UTC,"The meta is starting to expand. Early on Tsarina and Gobby were pretty much necessary to be competitive.  Now we have cards like Jinzo, BEWD, Constantine, FWX, Millenium Puzzle, and Red Dragon to name a few that are being used effectively and with success. Polymorph being in the mix makes cheap teams not as unstoppable as they once were too."

Unless they put something in a set that makes these even more broken, I'm sure we'll see less and less of them.  The only person I remember running both was Remington. There could have been others that I'm not remembering. I'm just glad it wasn't every other person running a team variation of just these 2 cards."

dicemasters,3bzybz,xgumbi,3,Fri Jul 3 14:54:11 2015 UTC,Breath Weapon triggers when the Dragon is assigned to attack. Even if your opponent could distract the Dragon away the ability would still fully resolve once it triggers.
dicemasters,3bzybz,IgwanaRob,2,Fri Jul 3 15:02:51 2015 UTC,"There's no conflict here.  Breath weapon is a ""when attacks / when assigned to attacks"" effect. Both ""when attacks"" and ""when assigned to attack"" function identically to each other in this game.  This occurs before blockers are assigned and before the window for globals.  There is no rewind button in this game so you resolve abilities step by step according to phase order.  Attack Step phases:   Assign all attackers Resolve (pay for) any when attacks effects (BREATH WEAPON HERE) Assign all blockers Resolve any when blocking or when engaged effects. GLOBALS AND ACTIONS (Distraction global here) Assign Damage"
dicemasters,3bzybz,jhoratio,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:24:03 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure breath weapon is a when attackers are assigned power so it would go if before your opponent had the opportunity to use globals.

dicemasters,3bzou0,Picklenator,5,Fri Jul 3 13:27:44 2015 UTC,"They both go to used if they deal damage while at level one, but there is a few key differences.    When unblocked, a level 3 ""Big Green Bruiser"" will spin down to level 2, then deal 6 damage.    A level 3 ""Gamma Powered"", regardless of blockers, who deals damage to an opponent (Overcrush), will deal the full 8 damage, but then return at level 1.    A blocked ""Big Green Bruiser"" will deal all his damage, then not spin down, where a blocked ""Gamma Powered"" (level 2 or 3) would be returned at level one. But, a level 2 or 3 ""Gamma Powered"" appears to return to field even if killed (assuming he deals Overcrush), unlike ""Big Green Bruiser"".    These cards are mechanically very different, though I imagine in most situations, ""Big Green Bruiser"" appears to be the much better card."
dicemasters,3bzou0,NoxTempus,2,Fri Jul 3 14:36:59 2015 UTC,"I don't believe Gamma Powered would return to the field if killed.  If he's level 2 or 3 and is not blocked, he does his damage and goes back to the field at level 1.  If he is blocked and does even 1 damage of overcrush, he returns to the field as a level one, but still retains all the damage he took.  If it is lethal damage, he is KO'd.  Damage doesn't clear until the end of the turn."
dicemasters,3bzou0,WetFifty,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:08:45 2015 UTC,would be a great card to work with polymorph.
dicemasters,3bzou0,kmisterk,2,Sat Jul 4 18:35:31 2015 UTC,"a level 2 or 3 ""Gamma Powered"" appears to return to field even if killed    I'm on the fence on this interpretation. It's hard to tell with WizKids' vague wording how they intend this card to work.   I wish they'd hire an editor to stop these things from happening."
dicemasters,3bzou0,StormyWaters2021,2,Fri Jul 3 23:51:49 2015 UTC,"I believe the biggest difference is that Big Green Bruiser doesn't go the the used pile if unblocked while at lvl 2 or 3 (a VERY strong ability),   where Gamma Powered will spin down regardless of them blocking or as long as his overcrush gets through. He also basically ignores getting knocked out by combat damage too.  They're pretty different, but both have have pretty similar, powerful effects. It's a tough call which is ""better"". Going by stats I think you might be able to actually get more damage through with Big Green Bruiser since they'll likely do the math and just let 4-6 damage through a couple times instead of letting him crush for whatever the 6-8 will be left over after you stomp their blockers..  The other one they will pretty much all block to the max all the time. There's no reason to not block him like the other.  A couple of very interesting cards! Part of why I just pre-ordered the starter!"
dicemasters,3bzou0,Arbiterchrono,2,Fri Jul 3 16:03:20 2015 UTC,"In addition to the other comments, note that one is in the starter, one is from packs. One will be the only Hulk in a draft."
dicemasters,3bzou0,WalterSkinnerFBI,4,Sun Jul 5 18:21:25 2015 UTC,"If the ""Gamma Powered"" Hulk were to attack at level 1 and deal damage to your opponent, he would move to the used pile. If ""Big Green Bruiser"" attacks at level 1, he would still return to the field at level one, as he cannot be effectively spun down any lower.  Conversely, the text on ""Gamma Powered"" reads ""damages your opponent"" - not unblocked/not blocked. You could theoretically combo him with Thrown Car or some other mechanic that deals damage beyond the amount blocked, effectively returning him to the field at level 2 or 3 even if he is dealt enough damage to knock him out. That's useful for both clearing blockers and having Hulk ready to defend on your opponent's next turn.  The difference between the two cards is marginal, but it's substantive enough to merit two different tactical play styles."
dicemasters,3bzou0,NiceJobJohnson,2,Fri Jul 3 13:54:28 2015 UTC,"I understand now, it was a very specific wording problem and I am not good with those. Thank you for the help."
dicemasters,3bzou0,NiceJobJohnson,2,Fri Jul 3 14:30:58 2015 UTC,"No worries. I actually just re-read the text, and it appears I missed the ""if you do"" part of BGB Hulk's text. NoxTempus is correct - they will both go to used if they attack and are unblocked at level 1. I was also unfamiliar with Overcrush as a mechanic - it's like Trample in Magic: The Gathering, so no need for Thrown Car to deal excess damage to the defending player.  Basically, NoxTempus has it right, check out their answer!"
dicemasters,3byip3,Skragz1469,2,Fri Jul 3 05:09:53 2015 UTC,"It's just poorly-worded. It can be used as a reaction as it prevents damage, and it of course means ""up to 2 damage""."

dicemasters,3bw85l,mastachaos,3,Thu Jul 2 17:52:52 2015 UTC,I heard they only seem to be releasing fast because a bunch of sets were delayed by a port strike. It's supposed to be like one set per quarter.
dicemasters,3bw85l,StormyWaters2021,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:51:04 2015 UTC,"I still feel like a set per quarter is a bit much. Assuming I buy a feed and a starter for every set that's $105 MSRP (Maybe ~$70 if buying online?). That's about $400 a year for one game. Cheap by Magic standards I guess, but still a bit much for one game in my opinion."
dicemasters,3bw85l,Vandelay_Latex_Sales,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:46:02 2015 UTC,"Sure, but I think it's rather unfair to say ""$400 annually ($30/month at full retail) is too much for me to buy an entire case and starter for every set"". If you're planning to buy at that level, this is cheaper than other collectible games. If you're buying casually, like many people, you're looking at $15 for each starter (that you are interested in) plus whatever packs you feel like picking up.   Edit: This is of course assuming you'd pay full retail in the first place. Do brick and mortar shops even sell feeds at $90? My FLGS sells them at $60-ish, as do many websites."

dicemasters,3bw85l,lightbluestar,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:19:58 2015 UTC,It looks like they are reusing die faces.  The Spider-Woman die is identical to AoU one right?  Ghost Rider die also has the same faces (different colors).  I better get a Ghost Rider - Dan Ketch this time.
dicemasters,3bw85l,Picklenator,2,Thu Jul 2 19:32:46 2015 UTC,"This is a good thing. It means better longevity for the game, and you can fill in some missing dice from your collection.

dicemasters,3bw85l,ScottyB623,2,Fri Jul 3 13:31:02 2015 UTC,"In the starter from left to right: No idea maybe a new green goblin?; Carnage!; Silver Sable?; Ghost Rider; Superior Spider-Man; Spider-Woman; Kingpin!; ???. The last one I thought was Mysterio but he is obviously one of the dice in the background.       Of the dice in the background we see Mary Jane, ???, Spider-Gwen!; and three of the dice in the starter. Down the side of the left of the box we see a new Doc Oc, Mysterio, I'm unsure of the triangular die, Electro, and then Kingpin again. On the other side of the front it's more of the starter dice and what looks to be the Goblin Glider action die! Side panel shows Mysterio and Gwen again but this time Black Cat!       As for the Gravity feed, on the side panel, we have confirmation of Mary Jane and Gwen but we also see Agent Venom! His die looks to have the same symbol as our current Venom so I wonder if you're allowed to play ""Venom"" and ""Agent Venom"" alongside each other? As for the front it's a smorgasbord of Spider-People. Scarlet Spider, Iron Spider, Superior Spider-Man, Spider-Gwen, Spider-Woman and Black Tarantula maybe? Above the Dice Masters title box I see some more new dice. The die face with a cup of coffee is almost certainly Aunt May. To the left of her is a brand new Iceman! To the right are a few dice that are cut off but down on the end a purple/orange die is visible. I can't figure out what the symbol is though.     Anyone catch something I've missed?"

dicemasters,3bwfu5,CtuchikOfTorak,4,Thu Jul 2 18:36:33 2015 UTC,"Venom's effect definitely procs before you can trigger a global. Normally, the active player can assign the order of effects that happen simultaneously, but this doesn't come into play here. You cannot select the SK to knock out with BEWD while it is in your reserve. Ergo, it must be fielded first and then BEWD can select the SK. However, the moment it is fielded, it is knocked out and sent to prep. As such, there is never a moment where the SK is on the field long enough for you to activate BEWD and the effects are not simultaneous, so being the active player does not allow him to resolve the BEWD global before Venom knocks out the SK.  Plain and simple, you have to field the sidekick before you can BEWD it and Venom will knock it out before you get the chance, regardless of who's the active player."

One time for the Joker and a Manta (1+1), a second time for the second Joker (2) and then a third for the last Manta. People always seem to think this captures all targets 2 and lower, but you have to add the fielding costs up and stop when you hit 2."

dicemasters,3bxxjm,StormyWaters2021,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:35:30 2015 UTC,"Kaptainkurch does a good job explaining below.   Essentially, you add up the fielding cost on the character face that's facing up. Using Imprisoned you may capture dice whose total combined fielding cost is 2 or less. You can't capture every single fielding die with a fielding cost of 2 or less. So, you could capture an unlimited number of SKs and zero fielding cost character dice.  Finally, all dice are returned to where they came from after the capturing player damages the other player."
dicemasters,3bxxjm,Pithecius,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:19:05 2015 UTC,"So we played it right.  This is total number of captured during the game.   After 2 imprisonment from each player, we feared the counter attack that would come from attacking.  We did not damage the other player for about 8 turns."

Edit: And they may not know that this can't reduce fielding cost below 1, also.   For the record, it doesn't change the fielding cost, it changes how much you pay to field them.

Guys like Joker, Loki, Lex Luther can prevent him from buying/fielding that many things to begin with. Also any character who isn't blockable and just hit him right through his wall. SR Wolverine, SR Stirge, many other easier to get card would do this just as well. Alternatively, leave his wall alone and just do damage that forgoes attacking completely. Gobby, Tsarina, Human Torch, Jinzo are all good examples of just punching him in the face despite his field.

When my opponent ends his main step Toad forces an attack and does his 2 damage and then Joker would spread it to all affiliated characters. Then assume the attacker is not yet dead. My opponent chooses to attack with one other characters. I block one with a level 1 Cheetah and one with Joker on his level one also. Cheetah resolves first doing 2 damage to the attacker. Joker spreads 2 more damage to all affiliated characters. Then I assign the rest of the blockers/attackers as normal. Joker deals his 1 damage. Does this 1 damage add to the 4 that everything has taken at this point? Is this damage considered all part of the same attack and so it'd just count in with Cheetah's 2? It seems obvious to me that Toad's damage is separate from the attack damage so his would be additive. To me Joker just takes whatever the highest damage is from the attackers and makes them all take that much. The conflict here is if Cheetah's is additive because her damage happens at a different time."

dicemasters,3brc7v,joelanator0492,2,Wed Jul 1 15:03:04 2015 UTC,Look over the dice before the draft starts.  It gives you an idea of what you're hoping to see.  Draft multiple cards of the same character that you want to run so that you get multiple dice for them.  The battle strategy often depends on what you end up grabbing.  Same with the BACs.
dicemasters,3brc7v,Njordia,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:57:40 2015 UTC,"I've read up a bit on rainbow drafts, and it seems that the cards get passed around and drafted.

dicemasters,3brc7v,IvorySwings,2,Wed Jul 1 16:13:35 2015 UTC,"If everyone kept the dice but drafted the cards nobody would be able to field a team after the draft.   All the dice go into a pool in the middle. Once all the cards are drafted, you get a die for every card of that character you drafted.   It's called a rainbow draft because all the dice are supposed to be organized neatly by character creating a rainbow-like color spectrum of all the different characters.   This gives you a little information. If you have a common UXM Captain America in your hand and you see four Cap dice on the table, you know there are only four Cap cards in the whole draft. Do you take that common and hope you can snag a rare later? Then you'll have two dice to use on it.   If you snag a solid rare off the bat you'll want to keep on eye on how many dice there are for that character and see if it's worth grabbing commons just to have more dice to field your rare."

dicemasters,3brc7v,jkopplin,2,Wed Jul 1 19:31:06 2015 UTC,"depending on what set you are drafting, find out which common cards are great cards, then which uncommons are great cards.  You will probably want to draft one copy of a great uncommon card over a great copy of a common card first, depending on how many there are of a character in the draft (look at how many dice there are for that character).    As an example, with DC common cheetah and common firestorm make a great combo team.  Uncommon red tornado is great and works in pretty much any team.    I won a lot of Uncanny X-Men drafts because no one else thought highly of common Toad, but I always drafted one for my team.  He won me several games by simply forcing my opponent to attack into my forces, leaving himself mostly open for a follow up attack from me next turn."

dicemasters,3bp3vt,scorpious1109,2,Wed Jul 1 00:23:07 2015 UTC,"That is a hard decision as you can find a full gravity feed for about $70 but you can't find a rare BEWD under $50. If you have the funds, go for the box and use whatever else you open to sell or as trade. I can contest that I've opened two full gravity feeds of Yu-Gi-Oh and didn't open one rare BEWD but pulled 2 Jinzo's.

dicemasters,3bp3vt,ThA_FuBu,2,Wed Jul 1 01:39:30 2015 UTC,The two big values are Jinzo and BEWD. Some will argue but I don't think any of the YGO SR's are really deck worthy unless you're building a set deck and those can average in prices between $10 and $30. Plenty of common and uncommon cards to use in competitive Unlimited decks though from YGO. I do think the current price of BEWD is way too high but I had the means and funds when I was able to score one so I jumped at it.

That'll give a solid idea of what any given card is selling for and what people are willing to pay. There are crazy prices all over eBay on SRs but majority will not sell for what they have them listed.

dicemasters,3bp3vt,Schtauffen,2,Wed Jul 1 04:52:56 2015 UTC,I know a local shop just sold a R BEWD for $7. (sadly not to me)  So you can still find good deals.

Morphing Jar: Canopic Jar Thousand Dragon: Noxious Nostrol Gust  The best one out of this set in my eyes is Morphing Jar.

dicemasters,3bl89n,VoxxSkies,3,Tue Jun 30 03:15:25 2015 UTC,"Legal Teams will have:  -No More than 8 unique characters  -No More than 20 total dice  -No More than 4 dice per unique character  -Exactly 2 Basic Action cards, each with 3 generic dice (of 2 different colors)  That's basically it. I don't want to say ""always play X number of 2 drops and make sure you work in PXG on every team,"" because deck construction and finding out ways to make a team work or get your interactions online is part of the fun of any game with deck construction.  THAT SAID, if you are playing any creature bigger than a 5-cost to buy, you should probably either have a plan to buy it using some sort of acceleration, or a darn good global on it to take advantage of and only run 1 die of it."
dicemasters,3bl89n,npcdel,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:20:18 2015 UTC,No More than 4 dice per unique character   Is this actually a rule?
dicemasters,3bl89n,StormyWaters2021,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:34:11 2015 UTC,"No, that's actually incorrect. Most characters have a maximum of 4 dice, but some characters actually have a higher maximum such as all the uncommon versions of the starter characters from AvX who have a max of 5 dice."
dicemasters,3bl89n,Necromanticer,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:36:19 2015 UTC,Some also have a lower max. Like Harpie Lady: Furious Fowl and Minsc and Boo.

dicemasters,3bknv3,skajohnny,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:47:57 2015 UTC,"I played a lot of Magic and Yugioh. For Magic, what I'd do is browse articles on SCG and threads on MTGS. Also watching vids like the SCG versus series helped a lot too. I started with standard and slowly worked my way into understanding a bit more about Modern and Legacy,"
dicemasters,3bknv3,skajohnny,2,Tue Jun 30 02:35:27 2015 UTC,"It's similar to MTG, there's different strategies out. Burn, Aggro, Control, Midrange. What I have seen work best is if you build a couple strategies together to ensure they don't have a hard counter to what you're doing. The Meta here is really shifty, because you have 8 characters and 2 actions. In any given game, you probably won't grab more than 1/3 of your dice. Globals are very important. Professor X is really popular because his global allows ramp of 2+ dice per turn. You can ramp in to some ridiculous things pretty fast.  Some resources are on the sidebar, like DiceAnon, Reserve Pool, Sidekicks n Shields, etc. I'd start there. If you have any specific questions, I will try my best to answer."
dicemasters,3bknv3,skajohnny,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:43:46 2015 UTC,"This is an good example of the trouble I'm having, I know you're trying to help, but I already know PXG is nuts, that there are a few different viable strategies like aggro, control, combo. I know enough form practice you won't buy most of your dice. I need to know where to go to find more advanced info, I need to catch up to a game that's been out about as long as the human gestation period. I tried going to those sites, but don't know how far back I need to go to find still relative info that I'll understand."
dicemasters,3bknv3,thegreenlanternguy,5,Tue Jun 30 03:24:51 2015 UTC,"All of it is relatively useful. The game has only been out a year. MTG has the benefit of being around for 20 years. There are Pro-Tours and GPs and people who GET PAID to play. DM is a fledgling game. There isn't the same level of support. It is also showing a faster turn around time between sets. That means the Meta is going to shift much faster.   On top of that, nothing has really settled from what people are testing out. MTG has the benefit of 20 years of playtesting. When a new set comes out, it's easy to identify what's going to be good because you can usually compare it to something already existing. DM doesn't really have that. All the info is relevant on some scale.  I think it would help if you give me some examples of something that's giving you trouble. Or maybe ask a few questions. That would help me identify what area you're having issues with."

Pick Your Battles + Relentless/Swords of Revealing Light is enough for just about everything, especially since you have the SR Black Canary. With that in mind, you want one fist character that's going to be unblocked in order to shut the door. The best choice is Injection Fairy Lily - Forced Injection since you can get 4-7 damage out of her when you stop your opponent from blocking her. After those three characters, just build utility/ramp. Angel works since he's so cheap, but you don't need the other half of the team to make the gimmick work. Instead grab characters like Human Paladin or Lord of D. Ring to make sure your opponent can't use Distraction to stop your death swing."
dicemasters,3bjs46,Necromanticer,2,Mon Jun 29 20:23:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the link! When I actually first built this deck, I had Iceman - Too Cool For Words and Baby Dragon - Soft Scales, etc to do a bunch of damage since they can't be blocked, as well as the Injection Fairy."
dicemasters,3bjs46,Necromanticer,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:33:05 2015 UTC,"Hey, would you mind giving me some feedback for the updated deck? I added in a bunch of utility cards. I replaced Gaia Spiral Shaver with She-Hulk, because I feel like she's almost strictly better (though maybe still with an necessary ability). I again thought about going Bolt heavy with Gaia, Iceman, and Baby Dragon, but I ended up throwing that idea out because of Red Dragon. With Red and Baby, I would have to make a choice of what to spend my Bolts on. Baby Dragon is awesome, but maybe not as good as Red Dragon.   I really like Beast - Mutate #666, but I feel like since I'm using Swords instead of Relentless and Deadman, he's not nearly as useful. I also feel like Doomcaliber Knight and Ring of Magnetism sort of do the same thing. The Ring is cheaper and probably more effective, but Doomcaliber packs a pretty good punch. Thoughts?"

dicemasters,3bj2dc,WetFifty,5,Mon Jun 29 17:10:00 2015 UTC,"well, if you can open 180 packs, open 90 of uncanny x-men and 90 of justice league. that is a gravity feed each.  although i do agree with /u/CasualToast , 90% of what you open is just going to sit and not sell. even most of the rares that get pulled won't be bought. a couple of the more sought after rares and the super rares could sell, but for 180+ dollars worth of stock its not worth it.   i definitely suggest pointing out the huge loss this will make the store to your boss"
dicemasters,3bj2dc,crazy_raconteur,5,Mon Jun 29 17:41:34 2015 UTC,"I'd say wait for AoU since people will probably want the new stuff, and will be trying to complete sets."
dicemasters,3bj2dc,zacgree,2,Mon Jun 29 17:43:44 2015 UTC,"The purpose of opening packs for singles is two-fold: we want to have a draw that no other shop in the area has as well as actually selling the singles.  If you don't sell singles, people don't ask if you are looking to buy their collections.  We're willing to take a small hit on the product we already have sitting on the shelves in order to potentially attract more customers.  The cost is already sunk, we just have to decide if we want to wait for the packs to sell or try something with a higher potential."
dicemasters,3bj2dc,CasualToast,2,Mon Jun 29 23:39:49 2015 UTC,hm......not sure this seems like a great idea. Strikes me as a way to have lots of dead stock.
dicemasters,3bj2dc,teh_longinator,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:11:23 2015 UTC,I contemplated selling singles.  All I can tell you is don't. ..
dicemasters,3bj2dc,Vandelay_Latex_Sales,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:50:35 2015 UTC,"As others are saying, opening packs just to sell singles is simply not profitable. Most gravity feeds will have 1-2 SRs and 14-18 Rares. For it to be profitable in your store, you have to be sure that the worst distribution of singles is worth more than just selling the feed. Using the Uncanny X-men set's Cool Stuff prices, this is a potential breakdown...  Super Rares range from $14 (Spider- Man) to $26 (Scarlet Witch).   Rares range from $2 (X-23 and Sentinel) to $7 (Professor X and Pyro) with Psylocke as a big outlier ($14).   Uncommons and Commons are <$1 each (with Kitty Pride Uncommon as the single exception at $1.49)  So being conservative, let's say you get one SR and it's one of the mediocre ones at $20. Then let's say you average $4 rares and you get ~15. The commons, uncommons, and dice won't sell at all. You might be able to sell them in bulk to a new player and you might be able to sell a few to someone just filling out a collection, but at best you can probably expect $5 for as many commons and uncommons as you get.   So now it all adds up to ~$85 in pocket for something you could have sold for $90. This also assumes the ALL of the product moves. Plenty of players aren't collectors and plenty of collectors won't pay the listed price for SRs and rares if they're not that good. To complete my UXM set, I need a Pyro Rare and a Vision Rare, but I don't really feel like paying $11 for them since I don't see myself using them in my teams. I'd gladly trade a rare that I have a double of for them, but that's not profiting your store. The likelihood goes down from there when you're looking at your medicore (or just plain awful) super-rares. Nobody wants to pay $14 for that awful Spider-Man Super Rare and that's why CSI has 14 in stock."
dicemasters,3bj2dc,ThA_FuBu,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:52:10 2015 UTC,"To go in succession with what everyone else has said. I have made a profit from selling Dice Masters but it's not easy. Do not open packs to sell singles. This may be fun to do but your profit margin with be extremely small if not non-existent. Instead, buy from your customer base (both locally and online). Buy in bulk at low cost. You can still sell a full set of commons and uncommons and customers are willing to pay for them. Super Rare's and a few other rares is where your money maker will be. Find a means to get your hands on those cards for a low price and sell high. Although more people seem to be finding DM than leaving the game there are still a lot of folks that buy into this game and decide it's not for them. Those folks are the ones that will sell their entire collection for a flat price and often times, as a retailer, you can offer trade, store credit and bring their asking price down if you’re paying them cash. These practices will be your best bet in ensuring a profit.  Now to play devil’s advocate: Yu-Gi-Oh! Is the only set I’ve seen success in buying a gravity feed and selling them as singles. It’s not guaranteed but chances are you’ll open two Super Rares and at least one rare Jinzo or Blue-Eyes White Dragon (maybe both!). Since BEWD is firmly going for around $50 now and Jinzo going for about $25-$30, there is a possible profit margin of about $25-$50 just on those cards alone and you have the remainder of the cards to try and sell. Just keep in mind, unless they are popular in the meta scene, you won’t see a lot of sales. Just the occasional ones where people are filling in holes of their sets."

dicemasters,3bj2dc,ThA_FuBu,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:56:17 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you know MTG at all but when I got out of it several years ago I sold a playset of Force of Will. I sold all four copies together as a playset and walked away with $210 in my pocket. I thought that was a bunch compared to the $25 I spent on each one. I later found out that a full playset was actually selling for about $300-$350. Never a good feeling when you take a loss like that but you live and learn. At least it was a huge amount you missed out on and to be honest, I don't suspect BEWD to keep selling for $50 for too long."
dicemasters,3bj2dc,NoxTempus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:57:58 2015 UTC,"As someone who works in an LGS, it all depends on your community. As the other guys said, making less than $90 bucks per box is terrible, but it depends how far down the line you sights are set.    It really depends on whether or not you think your player base will respond well to the commons/uncommons/dice. Will you have a few players willing to spend a few dollars to finish of their set of a particular characters dice? Maybe they opened 20 boosters, don't feel like more, but just need a few dice to fill out that character they ""really like"".  Additional factors to consider: Will this bring new players into the game? Will this encourage new players to start playing in store? Will this bring existing players into the store more often? How will the display look? Where will you put it? (DM dice look great in a pile in a cabinet.)    Value doesn't necessarily come just from straight sales, but also the exposure it creates and interest it generates.    Also, to actually answer the question, 90 Uncanny X-Men and 90 Justice League is a good way to go."
dicemasters,3bj2dc,NoxTempus,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:05:01 2015 UTC,"A lot of people here are forgetting the unique problems that face a brick and mortar store. You need to get players in the store playing games wherever possible.    Maybe on paper, losing a potential $10-$20 profit is bad, but if it creates a few casual players or one dedicated player in the process, it is likely very much worth the ""cost"".    Your LGS is not a normal retail store, building communities comes first. We don't make our money grinding out pure profit from random walk-ins, we make it from dedicated repeat customers."
dicemasters,3bj2dc,npcdel,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:12:22 2015 UTC,"Don't open any packs. Even at retailer prices, you're almost never +EV to open packs. Buy singles from the community. If you must open packs, DC is the new hotness and will give you the most dice people are looking for singles in, and Constantine pays for a box himself at retail markdown."
dicemasters,3bj2dc,protoss_avatar,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:42:29 2015 UTC,This.  Buying from the community has much better margins.  It's how Magic stores manage to run events at break-even / a loss.  You'll want to roughly buy them at 1/3 - 1/2 of what you'll be selling them for.
dicemasters,3bibfx,jcubshor,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:33:50 2015 UTC,"I just got started this weekend after joining a friendly tournament run by my friend. I'll share the advice he gave me.  The first thing you need to ask yourself is...do I just want to play to have fun, or do I want to be competitive?  If you just want a fun game to play around with, then just buy what sets appeal to you. 1 or 2 starter sets will get you and a friend everything required to play and you can add sets as you fancy.  If you want to be competitive, that's a whole different ballpark.  He advised that the original AvX sets and Yu-gi-oh sets are getting a bit harder to find and prices might be going up. (Which is odd, going online I saw quite a few people selling Yu-gi-oh for high prices, yet I could walk into my local Wal-Mart and find booster packs for 89 cents.)"
dicemasters,3bibfx,LordTekno,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:47:10 2015 UTC,"I would highly recommend picking up any starters you think you'd be interested in.

Also, depending on the teams at your tournament, you may want to adjust your team to what you think other people will bring; real life local team meta is oftentimes entirely different from major tournament meta.

Loki's good, but a little expensive, especially if you can just buy Joker for 3.  Obviously Constantine: Hellblazer (JL) would be a good choice, but if you don't have that, consider finding another 2 cost character that you could buy in a pinch.  Beast (AvX) or Storm (AvX/UXM) are good candidates here.  I play a very similar team, and I've found that occasionally I'll stall out and run out of things to do.  In that case, you might want to look for something that can KO your own villains.  I chose Batarang: Tool of the Bat, for potential coverage on both sides of the field, but Mister Sinister: Nasty Boy (UXM) would fit that pretty nicely.  Obviously Blue Eyes - Monstrous Dragon is ideal for this slot, but I don't have any Yu-Gi-Oh cards either.  Sinestro: Sinestro Corps Leader (JL) is also an option if you find yourself being concerned about global abilities.  I've had great success with this theme, and it looks like you've got all the important stuff here.  My biggest note is reconsider Villainous Pact.  Unless you're using the action die effect itself, the global actually helps your opponent as well, and you don't particularly need it.  I'm fond of the Relentless/Transfer Power action combo myself (great defensive/offensive options), but your Anger Issues is obviously useful."
dicemasters,3bf9mp,forte27,2,Mon Jun 29 14:17:27 2015 UTC,"The reason why I include Loki instead of just buying another Joker for three is that two Jokers still only lock down two opposing character dice. Loki + Joker would keep my opponent from being able to field two different characters. If this works, it should be crippling."
dicemasters,3bf9mp,forte27,2,Tue Jun 30 09:24:34 2015 UTC,"You are correct, of course.  My strategy focused on buying things more cheaply (my only 5 cost character is Deathstroke, not counting Joker), but the double lockdown would certainly be devastating and useful depending on the team you're fighting against.  I'd still suggest finding a 2-cost character to work with, though.  Sinestro would probably be the candidate for replacement if you're holding onto Loki.  If you're going to have Villainous Pact, then I guess you might not need the 2-cost, but I haven't tested that idea."
dicemasters,3bf9mp,Bahamut7,2,Tue Jun 30 13:37:51 2015 UTC,"Your team seems spot on for what you have. I have used Villainous Pact on my villain team and it was beautiful. Far better than Relentless. Honestly, just playtest and tweak as you can. If you can throw on some spot removal that can be used on your own guys, you will have direct damage that can get through any annoying walls."

dicemasters,3bfltd,fatheroceallaigh,2,Sun Jun 28 20:06:55 2015 UTC,"He does not need to attack alone. This is a way of over creative way to write down, that even if you attack with multiple beholders you get to trigger his ability only once."
dicemasters,3bfltd,Viktor2m,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:11:00 2015 UTC,"Actually, it's very important to the order of the attack step as well. Normally, you assign all attackers and then resolve attacking effects. However, Beholder allows you to use the action dice and go on to assign more attackers. This is very important for actions like Monster Reborn or Transfer Power that could field more characters. With the regular timing, you wouldn't be able to declare attacks with the extra characters. However, with the way Beholder is worded, you get to assign more characters to attack after the effect resolves, meaning that characters fielded with your actions get to join in the attack alongside Beholder."
dicemasters,3bfltd,Necromanticer,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:33:08 2015 UTC,"I would disagree with your interpretation. Only after you have assigned all your attackers, would you resolve the Beholder's ability.  Source (Rule Book): After you declare all attackers, apply any effects that happen due to characters attacking.  And this ability, while worded differently, is still an ability that happens due to a character attacking, and the rules are clear that such abilities occur after all attackers have been assigned."

dicemasters,3b9sfr,Picklenator,2,Sat Jun 27 03:49:08 2015 UTC,"No, overcrush only affects combat damage. Combat damage only occurs when a character is unblocked and deals its damage to a player directly or 2+ characters are engaged and assign then resolve their damage to each other. That said, Cyclops will HEAVILY soften up your opponents field and if you put the overcrush on him before he swings, that will boost his attack damage to your opponent's field as well.  No, Black Manta - Artificial Gills only counts other unique characters. As such, if you have 2 Black Mantas fielded and 3 Darkseids out, the Black Mantas will have +1/+1. On the other hand, if you have 2 Black Mantas out, 1 Darkseid out, and 1 Deathstroke out, the Black Mantas will have +2/+2. Note, Black Manta also counts your opponents villains as unique from your own, so if you have 1 Black Manta out, 1 Darkseid out, and your opponent has 1 Darkseid out, Black Manta will still have +2/+2.  Teamwork functions almost identically to how Black Manta does. Each of your characters with an affiliation gains +1/+1 for each other unique character out that shares that affiliation. However, Teamwork only affects your characters and only counts your characters."

dicemasters,3b7ovi,shinymuskrat,4,Fri Jun 26 17:12:01 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, the card doesn't say ""When activated"", it says ""When fielded"", which is a trigger, not a condition.   The trigger should more accurately say ""When you field a die from this card, do X"". Contrast this with conditions such as Aquaman - King of Atlantis: While Aquaman is active... means that ""As long as condition A is met, B happens"", so nothing special happens when you field a second die."

dicemasters,3b7ovi,Spiral0Architect,2,Sat Jun 27 06:16:53 2015 UTC,Yes on both
dicemasters,3b7nd2,shinymuskrat,3,Fri Jun 26 17:01:02 2015 UTC,"Yes and no...  Like all while active effects retaliation does not stack from the same character, but they do stack from different characters. Say for instance you have 4 Cyborg dice on the field and 2 of them die, your opponent takes 2 damage. However, if you have 2 cyborg dice on the field and 2 batman dice on the field, and your opponent knocks out one of each, your opponent takes 4 damage after the knockouts resolve (two from Cyborg's retaliation and 2 from Batman's).  Finally, retaliation only procs if it remains on the field afer the knockouts are applied. As such, if you attack with your whole field and they all die in combat, there's no one left over with retaliation to deal the damage and your opponent is fine."
dicemasters,3b7nd2,Necromanticer,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:29:35 2015 UTC,Gotcha. That makes sense. Thanks!
dicemasters,3b7nd2,bankholdup,0,Fri Jun 26 17:33:26 2015 UTC,"Since I'm oddly getting down votes on my comment, I'll provide evidence. http://www.wizkidseventsystem.com/bb/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=5685  In the ruling, they state that if Flash is knocked out and there are three Cyborg dice in the field, retaliation would only do one damage, because it only triggers for the one character in the field, Cyborg, not for each instance of Cyborg in the field. If it triggered for each Cyborg die in the field when Flash is knocked out then the ruling would be three damage."
dicemasters,3b7nd2,Necromanticer,2,Fri Jun 26 18:13:20 2015 UTC,"That's because if you look at my example, 2 Cyborg dice die, making 2 damage since the Cyborg retaliation only triggers once per Cyborg dying depiste my having two left active.. The example you link has a single Flash dying while 3 Cyborgs are active, this means that Cyborg's retaliation triggers once and your opponent takes 1 damage."
dicemasters,3b7nd2,StormyWaters2021,2,Fri Jun 26 18:23:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, exactly."
dicemasters,3b7nd2,bankholdup,0,Fri Jun 26 18:33:27 2015 UTC,"Retaliation doesn't trigger per die that is knocked out, it triggers for each unique that is knocked out. And it only triggers for each unique character left in the field with retaliation."
dicemasters,3b7nd2,Necromanticer,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:34:44 2015 UTC,"No, Retaliation triggers per die that is knocked out. However, it only triggers once per unique character with the retaliation ability that is active.  It functionally counts 2 things and then multiplies them:   How many affiliated dice were knocked out How many different affiliated retaliation effects remain active   In my first example, 2 affiliated dice were knocked out and 1 different affiliated retaliation effect remained active, equaling one damage. In my second example, 2 affiliated dice were knocked out and 2 different affiliated retaliation effects remained active, equaling 4 damage. In your cited exampled, 1 affiliated die was knocked out and 1 different affiliated retaliation effect remained active, equaling 1 damage.  Retaliation does not check the uniqueness of the knocked out dice, but rather their number and the uniqueness of the retaliation effect holders."
dicemasters,3b7nd2,bankholdup,-1,Fri Jun 26 18:40:25 2015 UTC,Your second example is correct. Your example of four Cyborg dice out and two of them being knocked out yielding two damage is incorrect.

dicemasters,3b7nd2,StormyWaters2021,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:56:42 2015 UTC,It is definitely correct and you are misunderstanding the ruling.
dicemasters,3b7nd2,StormyWaters2021,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:48:18 2015 UTC,"That ruling has nothing to do with this reply. That ruling is if one character is KO'd, Cyborg only triggers once even if there are several Cyborg dice still remaining.   The statement you responded to says ""If two Cyborg dice are KO'd, you deal 2 damage"", which is correct: there are two separate triggers, each dealing one damage."
dicemasters,3b7nd2,bankholdup,-3,Fri Jun 26 18:25:56 2015 UTC,Your Cyborg example is incorrect. Two Cyborgs on the field and two knocked out would only result in one damage.
dicemasters,3b7nd2,StormyWaters2021,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:33:12 2015 UTC,Each of the KO'd dice will trigger Retaliation for one point each. That's two total points of damage.

dicemasters,3b7nd2,StormyWaters2021,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:15:49 2015 UTC,"This is not what we're talking about. The ruling says that when 1 character is KO'd, only 1 Retaliation will trigger for each character that has Retaliation. So if you have 3 Cyborg out and one of them is KO'd, it only triggers one damage (not 2 for the two Cyborgs left in the field).   This is two characters being KO'd, which is two separate triggers."
dicemasters,3b7nd2,bankholdup,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:23:40 2015 UTC,"That's not what they are saying. The asker stated that they had four unique character dice in the field, one then gets knocked out. In the response WizKids changed the parameters of the question to three Cyborg dice out in the field, keeping one Flash as the die that was knocked out, which deals one damage. They didn't change who was knocked out just who was still out in the field."
dicemasters,3b7nd2,StormyWaters2021,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:38:40 2015 UTC,"Here is how it works, ignoring all other dice and cards:   I have 4 Cyborg dice in the field. One gets KO'd - you take 1 damage. I have 4 Cyborg dice in the field. Two get KO'd - you take 2 damage. I have 2 Cyborg dice and 2 Batman dice in the field, one Batman gets KO'd - you take 2 damage. I have 2 Cyborg dice and 2 Batman dice in the field, one of each gets KO'd - you take 4 damage."
dicemasters,3b7nd2,bankholdup,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:46:21 2015 UTC,The ability triggers after damage is resolved. You need at least one character with retaliation in the field and you do one damage for each unique character with the affiliation that is knocked out.

Characters like Curse of Dragon and Lord of D. that affect characters with ""dragon"" in their name actually check for "" dragon "" being within the title. Orc simply checks for other Orc dice. There's no real comparison here. Half-Orc Fighter is not the same die as Orc, so the Orc ability does not include Half-Orc Fighter dice in the calculation."

dicemasters,3b3w9e,MrQuickLine,3,Thu Jun 25 19:33:13 2015 UTC,"This is the best way to use it. There's a transition zone where energy you've spent on your turn can't be used in this stuff, but there's no transition on your opponent's turn. If you save up 3 masks and have 3 sidekick dice in your Used Pile, you can spend 1 mask, move 2 over, spend another mask and move 2 over (including the one you just used) and use a third mask and move 1 over (the one you just used)."
dicemasters,3b3w9e,MrQuickLine,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:46:40 2015 UTC,This sounds too good to be true.  Can I get a second opinion?
dicemasters,3b3w9e,thegreenlanternguy,3,Fri Jun 26 01:17:28 2015 UTC,"This is the example from the WizKids rule book:   At the end of her last turn, Liz moved 3 Sidekick dice from out of play to her Used Pile. She kept two [?]'s in her Reserve Pool, hoping to use them during Kyle’s turn. When she has an opportunity to pay for Globals during Kyle’s Main Step, she chooses to use Professor Xavier, Trainer’s Global Ability: Liz spends a [?] for the cost of a [Mask]. It goes to her Used Pile because it isn’t her turn. She then moves two Sidekick dice from her Used Pile to her Prep Area. She then chooses to use Professor Xavier, Trainer’s Global Ability again. She again spends a [?] for the cost of [Mask]. . She can move another 2 Sidekicks from her Used Pile to her Prep Area."
dicemasters,3b40uv,Spiral0Architect,3,Thu Jun 25 20:04:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not familiar with how cubes work.  Could you explain?  Probably the Magic players know already, but I've never played Magic."
dicemasters,3b40uv,jhoratio,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:08:38 2015 UTC,"Ah, I should have explained. Sorry for that, I didn't think about it.   A cube is basically a custom draft pool that is made by a player that they can use to draft with their friends. Usually the idea is to use all of the strongest cards available to make it feel like a supercharged draft environment with no chaff.  What you do is sleeve up all the cards and distribute them into piles as ""packs"" and draft. There are also lots of other ways to draft that people have come up with, but making packs and drafting is the most popular and straight forward method."
dicemasters,3b40uv,jhoratio,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:36:45 2015 UTC,"I see. Personally, I just take my whole collection of cards, shuffle them up and deal out a pool. Then I draft from that.  I really don't see a need to try to weed anything out at this point. In this game decks are only 8 cards, so its tougher for a certain cards to be ""bad"" in the same way can happen in Magic.  Nearly all the cards in this game are able to shine given the right environment. To me, discovering those environments is one of the best, most interesting things about this game.  I tend to keep sets more or less separate, so it helps when I'm shuffling them up.  I play both Marvel sets together, but D&D and DC as standalones."
dicemasters,3b40uv,thegreenlanternguy,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:53:00 2015 UTC,I see where you're coming from. A little editing can go a long way though. I don't want something like The Thing clogging up the works.

dicemasters,3b40uv,thetrevdor,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:33:28 2015 UTC,"If you plan on only playing by yourself (as in you won't be sharing your collection), maxing out dice is a good idea. If you plan on sharing your collection, collecting 6-7 dice per character is usually a good idea. Obviously, that's harder to do for some more than others, though you can typically just do max for lesser-used characters and go for ~8 for really popular characters."
dicemasters,3b40uv,Bahamut7,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:05:21 2015 UTC,"After reading how the cube format works, I still can't really answer. I can answer about the dice. If the format only had one of each character card, than depending on the card would determine how many dice you would actually need. As you progress into more powerful and costly characters, you don't really need 4 dice typically. Anything over 4 cost, I rarely have more than 4 dice."
dicemasters,3b40uv,Vanisaris,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:06:15 2015 UTC,"I've constructed pretty basic magic cubes in the past, and I guess the answer to your questions is somewhat dependent on how you plan to draft.  If you are going to use the Rainbow Draft system then I suggest the following:   Decide which characters you want in the cube. From the characters you've chosen, decide which cards you want in the cube. (You can have multiple versions to fulfill different deck ideas if you wish.) Decide how many copies you want of each character. I would suggest something along the lines of 2-3 of each common, 1-2 uncommon, 1 rare/SR. Add a number of Dice to the cube equal to the number of cards from each character. So if you have 6 Black Widows, use 6 dice, but if you have only 1 PXG, then only use 1 Dice.   If you wish to use a different drafting method (something more like Magic), then I would suggest the following:   Select the specific cards you want in the cube. Each character would only have 1 card. Add a number of dice to the cube equal to the maximum allowed by the card.   I like this idea less because it means you will draft far fewer cards. It could also lead to players sticking with the same plan over and over because they don't need to worry about grabbing multiples of the same character.  You can partially fix the problem above by doing a mixture of the two:   Pick a specific card you want for each character. Add a number of those cards to the cube that you want available. (ie. 4-6 Tsarina and 2 PXG). Add a number of dice to the cube equal to the number of cards you put in the cube.   This fixes the issue of one player dominating a character, but also means you need either multiples of the same card, or proxies to place-hold for multiples.  I would prefer the first option personally, because I like when cubes have decisions for the players while drafting."
dicemasters,3b40uv,AngryTetris,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:01:22 2015 UTC,"Here's how me and friends made a cube a while ago for MTG  Do a regular draft.  At the end, each player nominates a few cards that suck from their pool. Remove them. Try to remove somewhere around the amount that would be in a new pack or two.  Add a few packs to bring it back to the correct count, then draft again. Rinse and repeat. You just keep drafting, removing cards and adding new cards until it becomes hard to remove things. Then you make finer touches.  With DM, I feel like this would be even easier, because packs are smaller. Just keep adding and drafting and refining."
dicemasters,3b40uv,hookahriffic,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:09:45 2015 UTC,"My son and I are planning on building a cube. It is usually just him and I, but we are going to make it for 4 players. This will hopefully allow for  good variance, while allowing for archetypes to be well supported. So we are starting a 96 card cube. Currently we are trying to assess what we have in our collection, what we can afford to buy, and then finally making the 96 card pool feel balanced power level wise across the board. I hope this helps."
dicemasters,3b40uv,StormyWaters2021,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:31:53 2015 UTC,"I've had the same idea, but I just feel like the game is far too young to close off into a cube already. Magic has been around for a couple decades now, with thousands of unique cards to build a cube from. This game is relatively brand-new with a couple hundred cards to choose from.  My only advice is to wait awhile. I can't imagine building a Magic cube using only the first three or four sets, so why do it to Dice Masters?"

That said, they almost all have other uses as well.  Elf Wizard is great for purchasing and prepping action dice consistently.  Halfling Thief can mess with your opponent's dice.  Half-Orc Fighters is a machine if you can get the right gear on him and you never have to worry about anti-gear cards.  Finally, Human Paladin is incredible global protection. I actually run him on about a third of my teams just to keep my guys safe on the board."
dicemasters,3b2ua5,Vandelay_Latex_Sales,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:20:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I really wish they'd do something about this like say Villains or Yu-Gi-Oh monsters count for experience. I've played DND a ton and it's not like I don't get XP for killing NPCs. I guess they didn't want them to be too overpowered but as it is, Experience is a near worthless mechanic."
dicemasters,3b2ua5,Necromanticer,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:41:08 2015 UTC,"No, it's not a worthless mechanic in set. Out of set, it is a worthless mechanic since there aren't enough monsters to make it work.  In set, adventurers can make a devastating control team that sits back, gets monster knockouts with cone of cold or some other source of removal, and then has 6/6 characters with a fielding cost of 1. Slap on overcrush and it's good night for your opponent.  The problem is that D&D wasn't built with the other sets in mind. It was made to be played against other D&D teams. There are still characters that work out of set like Human Paladin, but it's simply too focused on intraset play to really change the meta."
dicemasters,3b2ua5,AngryTetris,2,Thu Jun 25 16:45:50 2015 UTC,"Having said that, drafting D&D is probably my favorite so far."

Very handy for a general overview.  As for getting Gravity Feeds, it's always recommended contacting your local game store to see if they can get it for you (they may even help you connect with other people in the area interested in playing or let you know if there's already a DiceMasters night).  Some good online alternatives are miniaturemarket.com and coolstuffinc.com"
dicemasters,3b1ed5,BigWurm,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:41:11 2015 UTC,"In order, as best as I can  1) Download the rules from the WizKids website, and check their page to find specific rulings that clear up grey areas.  2) Unless you're in a specific event that says otherwise, mixing sets is not only allowed, you're very likely going to need to in order to make the best team you can.  3) In the competitive scene, Dice Masters World Championship was held at the start of the month at Origins Game Fair. The videos should be easily found on YouTube. GenCon has a bunch of drafts scheduled.   4) Some stores will run events with a limit set to what cards can make up your team, as an effort to encourage people to try something different, but there's nothing directly comparable to the likes of Standard vs Modern vs Vintage that MtG has.  5) I would say the best way to get involved is to find a local game store that has events and to join in. Find a player who's willing to help you learn, the try a Rainbow Draft (kind of like drafting in MtG, but you should really check out a video to get a better idea) or if that doesn't work for you then pick up a starter set and try with a friend.  6) The game is currently popular enough that I've been seeing more and more events pop up all the time. It's popular enough that the first set (Avengers vs X-Men) still sells out pretty quickly when someone gets some in stock.  7) Price wise, you can usually find a gravity feed of 90 foil packs for about 60 dollars. If you get 1 gravity feed and the starter for a set you will probably get a pretty good chunk of a set. Not a guarantee, obviously, but better than trying to hunt down 4x of the 5-8 'must haves' for a Standard deck."

Dicemasters is still growing, so they may not carry them currently, but you can try to convince a shop to buy some product and host an event or two to get people interested.   If that doesn't work, Amazon, Coolstuffinc, Trollandtoad and Miniaturemarket all sell gravity feeds online at different prices.  There's also currently a drop on Massdrop.com for 10 packs for a little more than $6. There's shipping charges that bring it to a little under $10, but if you buy larger quantities the shipping only goes up a little bit, and it means you can get 90 packs (the number of packs in a Gravity Feed) for about $66 including the shipping."

dicemasters,3b01dv,notsnivyscott,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:47:16 2015 UTC,"Well, there's a few things I think need to be made clear:  1.) Distraction's global only targets attackers.  2.) It may be used only after blockers have been declared and the ""when blocking"" effects resolved (there's a very strict order to the attack step: Assign attackers, resolve their effects; assign blockers, resolve their effects; use action dice and globals, resolve their effects; blockers assign combat damage, the attacker assigns combat damage, and you finally resolve combat damage)  3.) The Distraction action die can be used in the attack step, but it will not prevent blocks that have already been declared (you need to use it in the main step for that to work)."
dicemasters,3b01dv,Necromanticer,2,Wed Jun 24 21:54:55 2015 UTC,Damage is assigned simultaneously.
dicemasters,3b01dv,kaptainkurch,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:47:32 2015 UTC,"Technically true, but as with all simultaneous effects, the active player decides the order. As such, is most beneficial for him to assign damage last and the active player is always the attacker, so the attacker assigns damage last. However all the damage resolves at the same time, so it doesn't affect much in the long run unless there is a double block on an attacker and a defender blocking two characters (such as the super rare Mr. Fantastic)."
dicemasters,3b01dv,Necromanticer,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:32:01 2015 UTC,How does the order of damage being assigned change outcomes with this example?
dicemasters,3b01dv,kaptainkurch,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:10:57 2015 UTC,"It doesn't come up often, but it's still good to take note of how the mechanic work. The only time I could forsee it becoming relevant is if your opponent blocks multiple characters with Juggernaut - Kurth and double blocks a beefy character like She-Hulk - Lady Liberator. In that case, I would see who my opponent knocked out With Juggernaut before deciding if I wanted to knock out both characters blocking She-Hulk and which one should die if I chose one instead. This is because if my opponent knocks out multiple of my characters, I want to set him back just as far and knock out multiple of his characters to make sure he can't swing back as hard. However, if he doesn't clear my field as badly, I don't want to feed him more energy to play with. In this circumstance, I would wait until the defender had assigned damage and only then would I assign my own damage in order to put me in the best position possible."

dicemasters,3ayg63,datix,3,Wed Jun 24 16:27:49 2015 UTC,"I mean, if you don't pull the strings or at least cinch it with your hand, dice will fly everywhere. Raining from the ceilings!"
dicemasters,3ayg63,WalterSkinnerFBI,3,Wed Jun 24 16:29:31 2015 UTC,"You don't want that to happen?  Boy, have I been playing wrong."
dicemasters,3ayg63,ShoppedYourPost,3,Wed Jun 24 17:55:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah ""rainbow draft"" doesn't mean ""make it rain dice."" That said, we could have a new format on our hands."
dicemasters,3ayg63,WalterSkinnerFBI,2,Wed Jun 24 18:42:37 2015 UTC,"Considering that many of the dice are different sizes, this method invites cheating and should really be disallowed if you notice it. Most people are just doing it out of habit, but politely pointing it out can help create better habits."
dicemasters,3ayg63,IgwanaRob,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:29:26 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen a ruling on it, but that just seems super sketchy...  Why not just shake the bag like everyone else?  It's basically like shuffling upside-down, sure you can't really see the cards, but you can really see the cards...haha"
dicemasters,3ayg63,xxdofxx,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:10:03 2015 UTC,"Agree about the shade factor here.  One hand outside of bag shaking it, then reach in to remove dice."
dicemasters,3ayg63,neuromorph,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:50:32 2015 UTC,"I was at Worlds when they made the announcement, you must remove your hand from the bag before you shake it. I don't know you specific case but this doesn't seem that sketchy. When you put dice in your bag, it is kind of a fluid motion to just then shake the bag and grab dice. Why use two hands when you can use one right? I recently had to stop myself from doing this, not because I'm cheating but because I'm lazy.  So it is defiantly illegal but in non-competitive or local format a lot of things are allowed or overlooked to keep the spirit of the game fun. I'd say politely point it out, the person probably doesn't even realizing it could look like cheating."
dicemasters,3ayg63,artsyanorak,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:11:46 2015 UTC,In some cases you can feel which dice it is.
dicemasters,3ayg63,iamjoen,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:34:47 2015 UTC,"I do this, but I've only ever played home games. I will try the shaking thing instead.   But even then, couldn't cheaters still feel around in there to draw? I have to feel around for four dice and pull them out, though I guess you could get really strict and make people draw one die at a time.   Cheating is one of those things that, if you're in a regular, nice gaming group, you don't have to worry about... also, I can see drawing the dice you need, but rolling them would be a whole nother thing too...   I would definitely discourage the hand shuffling, but I've never worried about cheating unless someone I didn't know was rolling a bit too hot. When I judged Heroclix, if a player was concerned about another player's dice, I would have them both use the same set of official Heroclix dice to play with.   Also kids, if you have to cheat to feel good about playing a collectible game with a bunch of nice people (at least that I've found in my travels), you have deeper problems."
dicemasters,3ayg63,JakeSalvage,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:04:53 2015 UTC,"I haven't upgraded to a higher quality dice bag and keep using the ones provided with the starters. I have noticed with these bags that widening the bag with your hand and than spinning the dice in horizontal motion actually better mixes the dice. I was bored waiting for my opponent and began testing different mix styles. This only applies to the bags provided with the game. A traditional dice bag could easily be cinched and shaken with no hands inside for optimal mix. The paper bags will sometimes hold dice in the corners which is why I use the method described above.  Not saying it doesn't look shady. Also, the Blue Beetle die can easily be differentiated from other dice as the beetle symbol is quite deep into the die. One die, the detail went to far."
dicemasters,3ayg63,Bahamut7,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:20:54 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that with my dicebag, I have to actually ""bop"" the bottom of the bag in addition to shaking it. Otherwise, I can predict where dice in the bag are and pull them when I need them. As some extra info, I use a larger dicebag designed to hold large amounts of dice, so that may be the problem right there."
dicemasters,3ayg63,notsnivyscott,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:00:57 2015 UTC,"I have a cloth bag that's fairly large, so I typically just shake it a few times and pull, which mixes things up quite nicely. I also have a nervous habit of milling my dice with my fingers during my opponent's turn. I do it with the dice bag on the table, and still shake before pulling so as to prevent me from being able to pull whatever I want, and haven't had any issues so far.  I've only ever encountered one person who had to be banned from our local tourneys for cheating by palming dice he wanted to pull when he went to pull his dice. Otherwise, people mixing with their hands in the bag hasn't been any kind of problem."
dicemasters,3aywg7,StormyWaters2021,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:44:37 2015 UTC,"Possibly intentional. Right now you can play Marvel Girl and Phoenix together and, depending on the story line you follow, they are the same person.    Same with Ant Man and Giant Man.  Also, there is a Black Lantern Aquaman that could be fielded alongside Aquaman.  The Black Lantern one seems to act like the Zombie cards from the Ultron set except that it is fieldable with the ""normal"" version."
dicemasters,3aywg7,KoutetsuKaigun,2,Wed Jun 24 16:52:00 2015 UTC,Both of the cards dice look identical.  I don't think you'd be able to use both of them because there would be no way to differentiate the dice.
dicemasters,3aywg7,GoGoNJDevil,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:17:31 2015 UTC,"Good point.  They may have to make an official ruling on that. As it stands now, I think the only restriction is that no two cards can have the same title."
dicemasters,3aywg7,KoutetsuKaigun,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:44:17 2015 UTC,Yeah...I don't think they've had identical dice yet.  Similar...but this is the first time they're exactly the same.
dicemasters,3aywg7,GoGoNJDevil,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:53:57 2015 UTC,"My guess would be that they didn't know they were making War of Light before they made the first set. It's more fun to use the Superhero names of the characters when there's no confusion, but having War of Light without Jon, Kyle, and Guy would have been pretty dumb. My guess is that we'll get a ruling that ""Green Lantern"" is Hal."
dicemasters,3aywg7,Vandelay_Latex_Sales,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:08:50 2015 UTC,"Sure, but couldn't they have had the names the other way in WoL? Green Lantern - John Stewart, Green Lantern - Kyle Rayner. Though I guess you then end up with two Green Lantern - Hal Jordan, huh?"
dicemasters,3aywg7,Vandelay_Latex_Sales,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:19:45 2015 UTC,"That would imply different art for the same ""character"" though and considering that they're probably going to have a half dozen or so Green Lanterns it's probably best they split it off. Though I believe from the spoilers they're making Guy a Red Lantern, John an Indigo Tribesman and Kyle a White Lantern. Still I'd bet we'll see Mogo and Kilowog at least as GLs, maybe even Ganthet."
dicemasters,3aylv7,jhoratio,4,Wed Jun 24 15:28:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not seeing the ""makes stuff up"" part.  Do you mean the fact that you have to field it as a level 1 character?"
dicemasters,3aylv7,raymondspogo,-2,Wed Jun 24 15:58:49 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah. I asked a question about how the card as written should be played. They essentially responded with ""the card shouldn't have been written that way at all!""  They are adding rules to the card that are not currently present on the card (level 1, free).  That's fine, but that's called errata.  If they are essentially rewriting the card text they should let people know."
dicemasters,3aylv7,raymondspogo,3,Wed Jun 24 16:03:39 2015 UTC,"Yes but the way you wanted to play it also rewrites the text.  ""I would assume that the Catwoman player may field any face they can afford to pay for."""
dicemasters,3aylv7,raymondspogo,-3,Wed Jun 24 16:07:06 2015 UTC,"Not really, it says field.  What do you take from that?  Where does ""free"" and ""level 1"" come from?  Plus, I'm not WizKids.  And I have nothing against errata, but they can't just errata cards and act like they're only clarifying an obscure rules question."
dicemasters,3aylv7,neuromorph,2,Wed Jun 24 16:09:24 2015 UTC,I'm all for anytime a character dice is drawn from a bag that it must be rolled and fielded only if you roll a character face.  Seems more in line with the mechanics of the game.  Hopefully dicemasters gets better at wording their cards.
dicemasters,3aylv7,zmobie,3,Wed Jun 24 16:11:37 2015 UTC,"Official rulings trump all, since they are used by judges in OP competitions.  You can make whatever house rule you want, but know that WK is the final word...."
dicemasters,3aylv7,npcdel,0,Thu Jun 25 01:01:00 2015 UTC,"Ugh, yes I know.  I'm not house ruling anything.  I am fully planning on abiding by WK ruling.  My only point was that the ruling for the card and the text actually on the card are different things."
dicemasters,3aylv7,ChefGuru,3,Thu Jun 25 01:03:29 2015 UTC,"It's almost like they didn't play it before they printed it...  I've been listening to Mark Rosewater's (lead designer of Magic) 'Drive to Work' podcast in which he talks a lot about Magic's early days. They did a lot of similar stuff... cranked out cards to meet demand without knowing how to properly template rules text or do development. This was ok then because the demand was just so crazy, and it was the wild west of game design. They were also mostly concerned with bootstrapping the product and making sure there was a market before going crazy on the game balance... but...  This is less ok for WizKids when we can easily draw on the mistakes of the past... we know 'game development' is a thing, and if your game is going to be more than a casual play one-off kind of game, these issues need to be ironed out and addressed. Bah. My frustration with this game grows. I only comment because I do love the game, I just wish they'd spend a bit more time in development.... or at the very least be more liberal with the ban/errata hammer."
dicemasters,3aylv7,neuromorph,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:35:15 2015 UTC,"I'm right there with you. What's most amazing is that Mike Elliot, DiceMasters designer, worked with Mark Rosewater, on the Magic set Tempest. Seeing WizKids do ""rulings, not rules"" is the most frustrating thing as a designer to see."
dicemasters,3aylv7,neuromorph,3,Wed Jun 24 16:40:30 2015 UTC,"Glad to see this clarified, but this should really be in the category of errata, since large parts of this ruling are simply not written on the card at all."
dicemasters,3aylv7,WalterSkinnerFBI,2,Wed Jun 24 15:30:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't see them ""making stuff up"", I think what they clarify makes perfect sense.  It sounds to me like you're just pissed that they've officially ruined a grey-area strategy that you've been using to try and use an opponents dice against them."
dicemasters,3aylv7,WalterSkinnerFBI,-3,Wed Jun 24 16:27:40 2015 UTC,No. I've never once used the card.  Don't even own it.
dicemasters,3aylv7,WalterSkinnerFBI,4,Wed Jun 24 16:53:23 2015 UTC,"Most come into play effects are level 1, unless otherwise written.... don't see how this is different."
dicemasters,3aylv7,bankholdup,0,Wed Jun 24 17:50:39 2015 UTC,"I guess so, but this is like referencing Dicemasters ""common law"".  Show me where this is written down somewhere. Glad to be wrong here, but I'm not familiar with an actual written rule on this."
dicemasters,3aylv7,WalterSkinnerFBI,2,Wed Jun 24 20:02:05 2015 UTC,It's in other clarifications such as polymorph.  Or teleport.
dicemasters,3aylv7,neuromorph,0,Wed Jun 24 22:04:34 2015 UTC,"Clarifications for certain cards aren't rules for the entire game and every card both present and future.  Regardless, both cards you reference give express directions as to what level to field. Nine lives gives none. At some point in this game's history we need to be able to read the card and do what it actually says and have that be correct. If card text really does trump all, we need to be able to take cards at their face value.  Not sure why people are arguing this."
dicemasters,3aylv7,neuromorph,2,Thu Jun 25 00:59:02 2015 UTC,"If by ""makes stuff up"" you mean ""worded it in the assumed way"" given that everything is minimum 1 and whatever else unless specifically stated otherwise, then dead on."
dicemasters,3aylv7,Vandelay_Latex_Sales,-1,Wed Jun 24 16:01:57 2015 UTC,Where would one assume level 1 from the card? Where would one assume free from the card?
dicemasters,3aylv7,Bahamut7,2,Wed Jun 24 16:10:34 2015 UTC,Because other cards that operate similarly have you field the character on level one and for free.
dicemasters,3aysor,scorpious1109,2,Wed Jun 24 16:17:33 2015 UTC,That doesn't look bad at all. If the index cards are strong enough it should work. I'd recommend a couple more steps inside the tower itself. Also consider cutting the bottom out and then you can just lift it off of your dice that you just rolled into your reserve pool.  I made mine out of foamboard and hot glue.
dicemasters,3aysor,DrJohnZoidbergPhD,2,Wed Jun 24 17:45:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I actually was just thinking of making this changes. After studying it more, I think I'm going to build a MKII, lol."
